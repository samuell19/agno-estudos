- My name is Alan Freed and this is my story. But it's also the story of rock and roll. Ladies and gentlemen of Boston. Let's give a big, big welcome to the band with the biggest hit in rock and roll history, Bill Haley and his Comets! ♪ One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock ♪ ♪ Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock ♪ ♪ Nine, 10, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock rock ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock around the clock tonight ♪ ♪ Put your glad rags on, join me, Hon ♪ ♪ We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock around the clock tonight ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight ♪ ♪ When the clock strikes two, three and four ♪ ♪ If the band slows down we'll yell for more ♪ - But let's go back to the beginning. It wasn't always like this. Believe it or not, there was a time when rock and roll didn't exist. Not even for me. I had been working the radio for a few years and I loved it. Okay, Cleveland wasn't the big-time, but it was better than Akron. See, I knew I was going places. I just wasn't sure where. ♪ What you gonna do when the well runs dry? ♪ ♪ You gonna run away and hide - You're late again? - I'm not late. - You're on the air in 10 seconds. - Well, I told you I wasn't late. Hey, Buddy. Good day, everyone. This is Alan Freed broadcasting to you from station W.G.B.C. in Cleveland. I have some fine popular music to play for you over the next two hours. So let's begin with a favorite from Patti Page, Old Cape Cod. Sing it, Patti baby. Let me hear those sweet, sweet high notes. - What'd I tell you about that funny stuff? - It's personality, boss. - Do me a favor, keep your personality to yourself. - So there I was, broadcasting in Ohio's biggest market, working every angle I could. But I was still lost and deep inside I knew it. The magnificent big band sound, ladies and gentlemen. And since you love it so much, here's some more. Remind me, is this a wake or a dance? That was sweet. And now for something really special. ♪ Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John ♪ ♪ He claim he has the misery but he has a lot of fun ♪ ♪ Oh, baby ♪ Yeah, baby ♪ Woo, baby ♪ Having me some fun tonight, yeah ♪ ♪ Well, long tall Sally, she's built for speed ♪ ♪ She got everything that Uncle John need ♪ ♪ Oh, baby ♪ Yeah, baby - Turn it off. Turn that music off. ♪ Having me some fun tonight - Can't you hear me? That's colored music! That music don't belong here! - What's wrong with it? - It's ugly, it's trash. - Now go back to playing good music. - What do you mean, good music? - Good music is what we want to hear. It's what we dance to, what our children will dance to. And if you don't want to play it, then take your records, Mr. Freed, and go home! - You have to remember, back then most white people had never heard of rhythm and blues. When it was played on the radio, it was by stations at the top of the dial. A place mainstream listeners just did not go. But that night really knocked me out. Their parents may have hated it, but there was something in that R&B those kids really responded to. And you know what, so did I. ♪ Just a little bit lonely ♪ Please, please, please, please ♪ ♪ Tell me where you're going to ♪ ♪ Now your daddy don't mind ♪ And your mommy don't mind ♪ If we have another dance ♪ Yeah, just one more ♪ One more time - Alan Freed, welcome to the store. How the hell are you? - Hey, Leo, you sell a lot of these rhythm and blues records? - Oh, tons. To the Negros obviously, but a lot of the white kids are buying them too, like crazy. - It's got a great beat. - Well, it's not like the stuff their parents listen to. - Like what I play on my show. - Oh, well, yeah. You know, actually, I'm thinking of sponsoring an all R&B program on WNXP. You know, up-tempo dance stuff. - Leo, how about sponsoring an all rhythm and blues program on WGBC with me? - What are you, nuts? Race records on an all white station? - Well, you just said white kids are buying the records. Now, if I could play it on a mainstream station I could get people excited about the music. - Absolutely not. - Come on, Pete. - I'm running a business here. - Leo's gonna sponsor the whole thing. It won't cost you a dime. - If I don't lose cash I'm gonna lose listeners. - No, no, no. You're gonna gain new listeners. Tell him about the sales, Leo. R&b singles are just flying out of the store. - Yeah, to the colored people. - White people too. Young white people. - See? Pete, just give me a chance and I bet people are gonna flip for it. Negro and white. Despite considerable resistance, the station gave me my one hour a night of pure rhythm and blues. Hello, everybody. How you all doing there tonight? This is Alan Freed, I'm brought to you by the Record Roundabout. And for the next hour I will be playing a new kind of music and this music is called rhythm and blues. Now, this is the kind of music that makes you really wanna jump. So, clear away the furniture, put on your dancing shoes, and let's go! Go man, go! Let's hear it! ♪ Well, now, they often call me Speedo ♪ ♪ But my real name is Mister Earl ♪ - Come on, play it! ♪ Um-hm-hm - You Alan Freed? - I am. - Oh, man, you gotta play this new record. This is the wildest! - Okay. This next one is from my new friend, Willie. Willie likes the beat and so do I and, mark my words, this song's gonna be a hit. ♪ Well, now they often call me Speedoo ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't believe - Play it, man! Yeah! The show took off like a rocket. It was like the whole city of Cleveland was tuned into Alan Freed. I would play a record at night, and the next kids would run out and buy it. Then one day, at the dance studio down the hall... - Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow. Are you here for a lesson? - Uh, do you teach anything besides the tango? - Of course, the waltz, foxtrot, charleston. - Anything more current? - What exactly did you have in mind? - I'll tell you what, I do this radio show down the hall. When you're done here, why don't you come by and say hi? - You're Alan Freed? Oh, I thought Alan Freed was colored. - Yeah, I get that all the time. - Oh. Well, I'm not done till late. - Well, it's an open invitation. You just come by whenever you like. - Okay. Okay, class, back to the tango. I need a volunteer. Come on, you guys. I need a partner. Can you dance? - No. - Okay. Music. Ooh! - Really want to impress a gal? Dance the tango with her. Not only did she come watch my show, she let me walk her home afterwards. It's not an act. I am telling you, this music could change the world. And I want everyone to hear it. - Why, are you a rhythm and blues missionary? - No, but I do get a kind of religious feeling when I hear a really good song. And the first thing I want to do is... - Pray? - No! Play it for other people so they can feel the same thing. So... Do you have a boyfriend? - Not at the moment. What about you? - I've got an ex-wife. She lives in Florida with our two kids. - Okay. - Well, yeah, things don't always work out like you plan. - This is where I live. It's my mom's house. This is nice. - Nice? I was expecting a different word, like... Sensational... Fantastic, magnifique. - I love your enthusiasm. - Well, it's my best trait. So, now that we've tangoed together, what do we do next? - We say goodnight. I guess that's what we do next. - Ya! Ya! And I wanna dedicate this next record to Jackie at the dance studio. Just to let her know I'm thinking about her. ♪ I fell in love with you heart and soul ♪ ♪ The way a fool would do, madly ♪ ♪ Because you held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ Held me tight ♪ And stole a kiss there in the night ♪ ♪ Heart and soul ♪ I begged to be adored ♪ Yes, and I lost control ♪ And tumbled overboard gladly ♪ That magic night we kissed ♪ Then we kissed ♪ Oh, we kissed ♪ Then we kissed ♪ Oh, we kissed ♪ Then we kissed ♪ Oh, we kissed ♪ Then we kissed ♪ There in the moon mist - So he's on the air now? - Right down here. - A beer flavor that can't be beat. So, folks, take a tip from me and give it a try. Then just pop a cap... - You always let your DJs drink on the air? - The man plays by his own rules. Say hello, commercial's running. - Jack Hooke, Royal Roost Records out of New York City. - Oh, to what do I owe the pleasure? - I thought you might be interested in some of my company's records. - Have anything with a strong dance beat? - As a matter of fact... - All right, people, straight out of New York City, here comes The Cleftones with You Baby You. - So you don't listen to them first? - You said it had a strong dance beat. - Hey, look, I can't pay you much. Uh, I'm kind of tapped out here. - It doesn't matter what the record companies want to play. If I like a song, I play it. If I don't, I don't. This song... I like. The station's getting its best ratings ever. All the advertisers want to buy time on my show, I'm getting a ton of fan mail. - All for a white guy playing rhythm and blues records? Wow! - I wanna take it to another level. I really wanna get the music out there. - So put on a dance party. You got half the fans you say you do, you charge a couple bucks a head, you can make some decent money. - How do I get started? - You book a big theater. You start pulling your acts together. - Will you help me? - From New York? - From here! Listen, you help me get this together, I'll split the profits with you. - Okay. I'm in. - It was wild. The first act I found was Jackie Wilson and the Dominoes. ♪ Oooooooo ♪ You can't keep a good man down ♪ ♪ No, you can't keep a good man down ♪ ♪ Oh, mamma, sweet mamma, we could really go to town ♪ ♪ No, you can't keep a good man down ♪ - Whoa. No one gets past here. - We just wanna talk to the Dominoes about playing a gig for us. - A gig for you? - I'm Alan Freed and this is my girl-- - Alan Freed? Why didn't you say so?! Let me get them. Jack, come here. Alan Freed, this is Jackie Wilson. - Jackie, what's the largest crowd you've ever played in front of? - This is it. - Well, listen to this: the Cleveland Arena seats 8,000. And I'm booking it, and I want the Dominoes. - You crazy? I never heard of a rhythm and blues show where even half that many people showed up. - Well, you've never heard of a rhythm and blues show promoted by Alan Freed. - Well, we'll see about that. People always making promises they can't keep. - Yeah? Well, if you wanna sell more records, if you want a shot at the big-time, then you sign up for Alan Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball and I promise you'll get it. - Take it, man. Take it, take it, come on. - I love it. - All right, folks, listen up, yours truly is putting on a dance, with all the bands and music that you can't get enough of. It'll be on the 21st, at nine o'clock at the Cleveland Arena. That's right, the hockey teams are taking the night off so you can dance, dance, dance. What if nobody shows up? - Of course, they'll show up. What are you talking about? - No, I am serious. The only advertising we've done is by me on my show. Now, it's one thing to turn on the radio, it's something else to put down real money and come to an arena. - Alan Freed, am I hearing self-doubt? Insecurity? Fear of failure? - Absolutely not! - Oh, that is so cute! Oh, honey, it's very endearing. Come here. - Hello, everybody, I'm Alan Freed. - More volume. - Hello, everybody, I'm Alan Freed! - That's good. - Hello. Testing, one, two... Jackie McCoy, will you marry me? Well? - Are you serious? - So, how're we doing out there? - Well, I'm still waiting for a report. But, are the Dominoes ready to rock? - Aw, man, the Dominoes coming out throwing their best stuff. Guaranteed first round knockout. You're not concerned, are you? You looking a little pale. - Oh, I'm not pale, I'm white. - Alan! Alan, the Fire Department is having a fit. The neighbors are calling in complaints. The police are here. We... We only have 8,000 seats. There are 20,000 people out there! It's a mob! - Hello, everybody! I'm Alan Freed, the old king of the Moondoggers! If you love R&B, you are in the right place! Now, this is the first time I've ever put on a dance like this and I've gotta tell you, it won't be the last.

And I wanna play this record a lot. And you know what, I liked this song so much I'm going to play it again. Now it's time to read some of the many cards and letters that you've been sending in. Now, this one starts, "Dear Nigger Lover, "how dare you play those vulgar, dirty, "ugly songs by Bo Diddley." Here's another nice one. "Your determination to Africanize our airwaves "makes me sick." Oh, and how about this one, it just says, "Keep that foul nigra music off our radios." Well, I'm always glad to hear the opinions of my listeners. And now out of South Chicago and Chess Records, Mister Bo Diddley! ♪ Bo Diddley bought his baby a diamond ring ♪ - Over the next year we had our first baby and the popularity of my show grew.

He is the hottest thing! - In Cleveland. This is New York. - Mr. McCaw, every time I walk into this radio station you say to me, "I'm searching for a new voice." I'm telling you, Alan Freed could really jump-start things around here. Alan Freed is your guy. - This is W.G.B.C. Who's calling, please? Alan, someone from New York. - Yes, hello. Uh-huh. Well, I'll have to call you back. Jackie, honey, I hope you're listening, because I have something very important to tell you: I just get off the phone with someone from a major radio station in New York City, and they have offered me a job. Now, I know you love Cleveland. I love Cleveland, too, the fans here are the best, but we are talking the entertainment capitol of the world Now, if you're up for it, give me a call here at the station and give me the green light. If I don't hear from you, I'll assume it's a no. I will call them back and decline the offer. Come on, Jackie! Yankees versus Indians. I'm waiting for your call. - W.G.B.C. First we've heard of it, too. W.G.B.C. I have no idea. - And here she is, ladies and gentlemen. And your answer, Mrs. Freed? - Turn off the mic. - We'll go to a commercial. - Why do you have to broadcast our personal life over the airwaves? - I'm sorry. I was just so excited. I mean, this is our shot. - Is this what you really want? - Here's to the king of rhythm and blues! - And to my queen. And New York City. You know, I've been thinking. The music needs a different name. Rhythm and blues is too limiting, people automatically think Race Music. It's gotta be something with a broader appeal. - And you got any ideas? - You know what I say, baby? You make me want to rock and roll. - Oh, but, honey, doesn't that mean, you know... - Sex? - Yeah. - Yeah, but the music is sexy: rock and roll. It says beat, it says hip, it says dancing. - Rock and roll. Definitely rolls off the tongue. - Say it. - Rock and roll. - Say it again. - Rock and roll. - Yeah, that is sexy. - Long live rock and roll. New York City, the Big Apple. They didn't give me a key to the city, they gave me something much better: a 50,000-watt tower and an open microphone. Hello, New York City! This is yours truly Alan Freed, Mr. Rock and Roll. And I am ready for a big of rocking and rolling! Welcome to rock and roll party number one! I'm going to be playing all the great rock and roll records with that big beat that nobody can resist, and by the time I'm through, New York City will be the rock and roll kingdom of the world! You can't stop this sound, you can't stop me from playing it. ♪ Up in the morning and out to school ♪ - Can I get some more volume on that? Higher. Higher. Yeah! That's the way to listen to rock and roll! I took off like no one in the history of New York radio. The station shot to number one virtually overnight. Alan Freed rock and roll clubs started popping up everywhere. Though I can't say that all the attention was positive. - Alan, I want you to meet a group of parents whose teenagers listen to your show. - What can I do for you? - Mr. Freed, are you aware of the sexual connotations in the lyrics of the songs you play? - Well, I know there are no four-letter words. - But the words are extremely suggestive and in some cases downright obscene. Just the titles alone. "It Ain't the Meat, It's the Motion, "I Got Loaded, "Baby Let Me Bang Your Box." And you think it is proper for our children to hear that? - Well, why not? If you don't think teenagers have sex on the brain, then you are fooling yourselves. And I think dancing to rock and roll is a safe, healthy way to express those feelings. I don't see the problem. ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Just say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Hey-ah-hey ♪ Say you will ♪ My heart is crying, crying ♪ Lonely teardrops ♪ My pillow's never dry of ♪ Lonely teardrops ♪ Come home ♪ Come home ♪ Just say you will, say you will ♪ ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Hey-ah-hey. ♪ Say you will ♪ Just give me another chance ♪ For our romance ♪ Come on and tell me ♪ That one you'll return ♪ 'Cause every day ♪ That you've been gone away ♪ You'll know my heart does nothing but burn ♪ ♪ Crying lonely teardrops ♪ My pillow's never dry of ♪ Lonely teardrops ♪ Come home ♪ Come home ♪ Just say you will, say you will ♪ ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Say you will ♪ Hey-ah-hey ♪ Say you will ♪ Say it right now, baby ♪ Say you will ♪ Come on, come on ♪ Say you will ♪ Say it darling Thanks for coming. - Great. - Thank you. - Jackie Wilson solo.

We're gonna teach this town to rock. - Sounds ambitious. I like it. I've been waiting to meet you since you came to town, Mr. Freed. I'm Morris Levy. I own this joint. - Oh, this is more than a joint, this is a great place to hear music. - I got good taste and so do you. Your lady friend is lovely. - I'm his wife. But thank you. - So you have a good ear and a good eye. What else are you good at? - Business. We should sit down and talk some time. We have a lot to discuss. - Do we? - Mrs. Freed, your husband's a very talented talker here. If he learns to listen he can go far. - Alan, they say he's connected to the mob. - And now he owns the most successful night club in New York City. - Yeah, but you gotta watch a guy like that. First, things start off all nice and friendly. Next thing you know, he owns you. - No one's gonna own me. Talk, Mr. Levy. I'm listening. - Answer me this: what does Alan Freed want? - Alan Freed wants to stage the biggest rock and roll show this city's ever seen. - You got enthusiasm, that's good. But you're gonna need a partner, someone with the right connections. - Someone like you? - There you go. But if we start out too big, there's no place to go but down. I don't want you to go down. Start smaller. - Let it build. - Right. I'll take all the financial risk. You just plug the show on the air and I'll give you half the action. - Only half? - You want less? - You're a real character, aren't you, Mr. Levy? - The realiest character you'll ever meet. And please, call me Mo. - You're not worried about that mob thing? - What mob thing? Morris Levy is a shrewd businessman. - I'm sure he's not the only shrewd businessman in this city. - What... Are... You trying to say? - That... If Morris Levy doesn't back you, someone else will. What's the big hurry? - Well, the big hurry is... Well, you never know what's gonna happen. I could be dead tomorrow. Get ready, New York, here I come! Yours truly, Alan Freed, the old king of rock and rollers, is putting on a big dance party at the Brooklyn Paramount. And all the greatest performers in the rock and roll universe will be there. Mr. Excitement Jackie Wilson, marvelous Clyde McPhatter, dazzling Fats Domino. Everyone. - 24 grand in 24 hours. I never seen anything like it. Man, this is nuts. - Welcome to America's biggest dance party. I'm Alan Freed, and it's time to turn up the volume! What do you want to do, Brooklyn? - Rock and roll! - That's right. It's time to rock and roll. Man, what a whirlwind! Shows, promotions, parties. Two years of non-stop rocking and rolling. - Ad revenues are up almost 50%. Whatever the hell you're doing, keep doing it! - Yes, sir. And I still couldn't get enough. Although I can't say the same for Jackie. And then Morris Levy called. He booked the New York Paramount. We had finally made it to Broadway. So now, I had to sell the show every way that I could. It was non-stop talk. I knew if I made the show a success, everything would work out.

When? ♪ Well, I'm leaving, baby ♪ I'm going far away ♪ Well, I'm leaving baby ♪ I'm going Wednesday ♪ Bye-bye, baby ♪ Down the road - Surprise, surprise! Hollywood suddenly discovered there was a huge teen market waiting to be tapped, and they thought I was the man to help them do it. Yeah, I know, but it's gonna be a couple of weeks more. All right. Look, tell her I love her. Give Siggy a big hug for me, and I'll call her as soon as we wrap. Thanks, Jack, you're a pal. My first movie was Rock Around the Clock with Bill Haley. I followed it up with two movies using all the stars like Chuck Berry and Little Richard. - Quiet on the set, please. Ready? Action! - You can put me in jail, you can condemn rock and roll all you want, but teenagers love it because it speaks to them in a language that they understand. It's not my music. - No. - It's not your music. - No, sir. - It's their music. - You got that right, brother! Hallelujah! Wooooooooooo! ♪ Where are you little star? - I was on such an incredible roll! But my wife was, shall we say, less than thrilled. Well, it's understandable. I'm off in Hollywood and she's home juggling Siggy and little Alan, Junior. Hello?! ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ - Daddy's home! - Siggy had the flu. She didn't sleep all night. - Ooh, how is my handsome little devil? You're the spitting image of your old man! - Yeah, he needs a nap. - Hey, uh, I've been gone for six weeks. Don't I get a kiss or something? No-one told me that rock and roll and a family life weren't compatible. Then I had an idea: a TV show would keep me at home. - Chase me, Daddy. - The network loves it. We will have dancing kids. We will have musical stars. We rehearse one day, then the next night I shoot it live at seven, home by nine. - What about your show on L.O.R.? - Oh, that will still happen six nights a week, but for three of them I'll have a stand-ins. Won't that be great? - It's great, Daddy! - My TV show featured stars like Little Richard. ♪ A wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, woo ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ A wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom ♪ ♪ Got a gal named Sue ♪ She knows just what to do ♪ Got a gal named Sue ♪ She knows just what to do ♪ She rock it to the east ♪ She rock it to the west ♪ But she's the girl that I love best ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, woo ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ Tutti frutti, aw rootie ♪ A wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Daisy ♪ She almost drives me crazy ♪ I got a gal - Daddy looks different on TV. - Yeah.

It ended with Frankie Lymon and a white girl dancing with each other. Southern affiliates are going crazy. Over 20 stations called the sponsor and threatened to take The Big Beat off the air. - All because Frankie Lymon danced with a white girl? - This is New York City. The rest of the country is a little behind in its racial attitudes. - Well, that's their problem. - No, no, it's our problem. The sponsor personally called my boss and said they'll continue supporting the show only if you book white acts from now on. - You've gotta be kidding! - I'm afraid not. - For crying out loud! The music was born in the Negro culture. They pioneered it, it's their sound. - And now it's crossed over. There are plenty of white rock and roll acts, what's the big deal? - The big deal is, it would be a lie. You can't put on a rock and roll show without Negro acts, you just can't! And then I say, "In their very first television appearance, "let's give a big welcome to the Chantels." ♪ Aaaah ♪ Aaaah ♪ Aaaah ♪ Maybe, if I pray every night ♪ You'll come back to me - Alan.

We're done. ♪ And maybe ♪ If I kiss your lips ♪ I'll be at your command ♪ Oh, maybe ♪ I pray and pray I love your house. And your kids are just adorable -- - And my husband's rich and famous. What more could I want? - To me, the answer is a tour. Sign up the ten biggest acts out there. Have them play every major city from here to Kalamazoo. Hire advance men in each place, make them really beat the drums. You'll hit the front page of every major daily in North America. - Yeah. But it'll be a logistical nightmare. It gives me a headache just to think about it. - No one's really done an all out national rock and roll tour. - You need it, Alan. This TV thing was a fiasco. It hurt you. - What do you mean, it hurt me? - You're off the air. Everyone's watching American Bandstand. Now Dick Clark's the big man in rock and roll. You gotta fight back, show them you're still number one. Am I right? Besides, it would be good business.

What do you owe him? - I just took out a little loan for the house. But after this one tour, I'll be able to pay him all back. - Jackie warned you, I warned you. - Look, it's nothing to worry about. - Owing money to a man like Morris Levy is nothing to worry about? - Will you come with me? - I'll have to think about it. - Now I had to put together the acts for the tour. I worked out of my office in the Brill Building. - Excuse me, ma'am, how long did Mr. Freed say he'd be? - Oh, just a little while longer. - Thank you. - So is this kid in the round? - Look, he's got great lyrics, a great voice, his songs have a great beat. - But, the kid's funny-looking with those glasses.

You're a singer. - I write songs. - What have you written? - Nothing you've heard of yet. But since you asked, here's a sample. Give it a listen. If it doesn't grab you, no hard feelings. - Fair enough. - But if it does grab you, maybe we could have coffee sometime? - Daddy. I'm gonna miss you, Daddy, so much. - Oh, and I'm gonna miss you, too. - All right, say goodbye to Daddy, he's gotta go. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye, honey. Now, you have a schedule.

Woo! - Mr. Hoover, this Alan Freed has been poisoning the minds of young people for years. - It's depraved what he does. Is there anything subversive in this Freed's background? - He doesn't seem very political. However, he is very friendly with quite a few Negroes. - Hm. He sells himself as some kind of crusader for the American teenager, when what he's really doing is corrupting their morals and turning them against their parents. Let's get everything we can on him. This rock and roll scourge may turn out to be more dangerous than communism. - The tour was a great success. And then we got to Boston. It was a sell-out. But the powers that be were out to get me. Ladies and gentlemen of Boston, for a change of pace, we have a nice, calm, very relaxed performer. What's that? I can't hear you!

No more tour. - Because of Boston? The papers said that people were stabbed and robbed and raped. - It's all lies! But they're still going to try to indict me for inciting a riot. - What's Levy gonna do? - Probably kill me. No, I'll be fine. - Boys. - Hello, Mo. Didn't know you had a key to my office? - I don't. Well, we got a disaster on our hands. After we pay off the talent and expenses, I figure you'll be in the hole about 200 grand. - Oh, I'll be in the hole? Mm-hmm. Well, then we'll just put on another tour this summer. - You're a hot potato right now. Nobody'll let you rent their theaters. Alan, this Boston thing is real bad. Everyone is turning against rock and roll. - Not the people who listen to it. And the kids love it more than ever. - The kids don't run this country, Alan, politicians and preachers do. You woke up the F.B.I. and the D.A. Right now they got you in the cross-hairs. - So what am I supposed to do? Go back to promoting Benny Goodman concerts? - You have any idea how much money there is to be made here? We are riding a wave and you're blowing it! What, I'm blowing it?! I invented rock and roll! I am rock and roll! - You were rock and roll. It's even bigger than you now! But you keep yourself so out front, they keep shining that spotlight on you. Well, see, we don't want any bright lights looking into our business, do we? - You know what, I don't need to take this crap from you. - Excuse me? - Get out of my office! You hear me? You get the hell out of my office! - You should talk some sense into him. - Alan-- - Just leave me alone! - Can I come in? - Hey, no, no, no, you no... - That's okay. - Oh, By the way, I listened to your demo. - That's the last thing you need to be worrying about. - No. You're really talented. It was great. - You think so? - Yes. Hello, everybody, how are you all doing out there tonight? This is Alan Freed, Mr. Rock and Roll. Yeah, I've been off the air for a little while and I just wanna say that it feels great being back in front of this big microphone again. So without further ado, let's play some rock and roll! The Boston prosecutor couldn't prove I was trying to overthrow the government, so he dropped his phoney inciting-a-riot But the New York D.A. began looking into the record business. Were DJs taking money for playing records? They called it payola. ♪ But I remember you ♪ It was not so long ago - Alan. - Oh, that. - You know about it? - Oh, yeah, they're the same guys that nailed Charlie Van Doren. And that's their job, to persecute people and make headlines. - Are you next? - Me? I'm clean. - What about that loan from Morris Levy? - They'll never get to Mo. - They can get to anyone. And when they do, that means saving his own hide, he'll give you up in a New York minute. - Not Morris Levy. ♪ Tears on my pillow ♪ Pain in my heart - Where are the kids? - Napping. - I need a hug. ♪ Love is not a gadget ♪ Love is not a toy ♪ When you find the one you love ♪ ♪ She'll fill your heart with joy ♪ - Sorry. ♪ If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate ♪ ♪ I'd gladly take you back ♪ And tempt the hands - Hello? - Hey, sweetheart.

That's a subpoena from the New York City Grand Jury. D.A. is launching his own investigation into payola. - There's that lovely word again. Listen, you could always take the Fifth. - I got these special agents harassing the crap out of me. A bunch of them bursted into my office, they seized the books for Roulette. They know about the note on your house. - That was just a loan... From one friend to another. - They won't see it that way and you know it. - So take the Fifth. - Thing is, they offered the record companies a deal. - What're you saying, Mo? You're selling me down the river? - We get immunity in return for testifying against the radio station people we did business with. - If you tell them what they wanna hear, I am ruined! - Alan... I'll do what I have to do. I know it's hard, but keep your mouth shut for a while. Lay low. Don't let your enemies bury you. - I've got my friends for that. - When this is all over, if you need any help, you let me know. - Where've you been? I've been so worried about you. - Worried about me? Gee, I don't know why. I only have the F.B.I., the I.R.S., the New York D.A. and the State's Attorney General breathing down my neck. Otherwise, my life is beautiful. - Why didn't you call me? - Look, you know what you should do? Turn around and walk away and never look back. - Don't treat me like this. - Look, Denise, you're a very nice person and you're incredibly talented. - This isn't about my career. It's about you. - It's just not that easy. - Don't do this. - Goodbye, Denise. - Close the door. I'm releasing you from your contract. - On what grounds? - Legally I don't need any grounds. - Do you even like music, Mr. McCaw? - Over the last six months you've had stand-ins cover your program more than 50% of the time. - Who I have paid for out of my own pocket. - And the ratings have remained high. You know why that is? Because people want the music, not you. - This is because of payola?! You can't stand the heat?! I made you rich. I built this business! - Yeah, that's right. But Alan Freed is no longer a business I want to be in. Tonight's your last broadcast. - Yours truly here. Now, before I play this last record, I have an announcement to make. After tonight, I will no longer be broadcasting on this station. And as of right now, I have no idea where I'll be broadcasting next. I just wanna thank you all for your wonderful cards and letters and your words of encouragement during my time here at W.L.O.R. I couldn't have done it without you... All you listening out there. I tried to play what I thought was the best in rock and roll. And as far as this payola stuff goes, I just want you to know I never played a record that I didn't like. That is the God honest truth. I did consult for the record companies. I told them what I thought might make it and what I thought might not. And they paid me for that, I provided a service. Sure I made some mistakes... But I never ever took a bribe. Now mark my words: when this is over and my name is cleared, I'll be riding through Central Park on a white horse. To those of you out there who supported me... Thank you. And to my family... I love you. And I want you to know this is not goodbye. It is just goodnight. We'll see you soon. And just remember this: rock and roll is here to stay.
