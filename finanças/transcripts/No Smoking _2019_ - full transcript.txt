Summer of 1945 World War II ended, leaving the world and Japan with deep wounds. Two years later, in the summer of 1947 Tokyo's Shirokane still smelled of the war. It was then that Haruomi Hosono was born. Before going to sleep I'd think about how happy I was to be born after the war. I was so happy about that. That I did not have to go to war. I still cherish that I was born in a time of peace. Of course there were many marks of the war still present. The house next-door was gone. It had burned. It was that kind of time. I think I was about three. My mother would often go to Ginza with me on her back. We would get on a tram at Shirokanedai. It started in Meguro and went to Hibiya. We'd get off at Hibiya and it would be filled with soldiers. I was on my mother's back when people I did not know came up to us. They said words I couldn't understand to my mother. I remember two American G.I.s giving me something. Probably chocolate. "Good Times Music, Again" My heart is filled with music I've listened to and seen since I was a child. My musical experiences in my youth were bountiful. The records I listened to have made me who I am today. It's true that my mother loved music. She made me learn piano. She liked music enough to do things like that. It wasn't unusual. It was part of the culture. People listened to more western music then. They put on SP records at home. Those spinning records were fun to watch. I kept watching them. It's even more fun that sounds would come out of them. At first, I couldn't put them on and I'd nag my mother. I think it was, "Sing Sing Sing." I called it the drum record. "Put it on!" I said. Eventually I learned to put it on myself. I did this everyday. We're a matriarchal family so my grandmother loomed the largest. She was my maternal grandmother. She would sit with her big bottom. She would groan as she got up. There were many aunts. One that lived across from me was a secretary at Paramount. A real career woman. She would bring home soundtracks from Paramount movies. I would go there every day to listen. People like Bob Hope. They were music that would later enter my repertoire. Like "Good Morning Mr. Echo." A photo of the Hosono family. They lived with his maternal grandfather who was a piano tuner. The paternal grandfather was the only Japanese on the Titanic. The child he had after his return was Hosono's father. It was my father who taught me jokes. There's a gag I do. A laughing person who turns angry. He taught me all of that. They were so funny. He used to do things like this. He also taught me things like this. They all came from the U.S. Probably... This too. My father would sometimes admit quietly that he wanted to be a dancer like Fred Astaire. He probably dreamt of things like that. In the sixth grade, music in the charts began to change. The Ventures were a big hit. They were so lively. Suddenly, my classmates began buying electric guitars. Everyone had it then. But I didn't. Around 1961 or 1962... The Beach Boys started to appear. I thought they were great. They had some instrumentals so I would copy them. Hosono entered Rikkyo High School in 1963. He began covering modern folk bands like Peter, Paul and Mary and The Kingston Trio who were popular then. He was especially influenced by Bob Dylan. He then entered Rikkyo University and began his college life. Music was really all I was doing. My university band was not very interesting. But they did have the ability to produce. They would gather people and do a show. That was a very stimulating and important scene for me. A lot of important encounters with with people I still hang out with. For example, Tatsuo Hayashi and Shigeru Suzuki. One day, this guy came to visit my house in Shirokane. That was Eiichi Ohtaki. I will never forget that day. I had absent-mindly, left the record of "Get Together" by The Youngbloods who I liked and were popular at the time. Then Ohtaki who came in without any pleasantries walked into my room and said, "Oh, Get Together!" I thought, "Amazing." "He gets it." The music he encountered then was Buffalo Springfield. He also continued to make more friends. I'm not a very forward person. I live quite idly but people seem to gather around me. Once, Takashi Matsumoto called. He somehow had my number. Whenever he had a moment, he'd read a book. When I saw what he was reading they were often poetry books. I thought, "Oh, Matsumoto is a literary type." I gradually began to understand his talent. In 1969, as a senior in college he was invited by friends like Hiro Yanagida and Chu Kosaka to join THE APRYL FOOL with Takashi Matsumoto. They debuted professionally but broke up after releasing one album. Later, he attempted to create a new group with Chu, Takashi and others. But when Chu was cast in the musical "Hair" that project fell through too. That was when Ohtaki called me and all he said was, "I understand Buffalo Springfield." That was enough. I thought to start a band. Hosono, Matsumoto and Ohtaki and others went on a trip to the Tohoku region to figure out the band. They brought in Shigeru Suzuki on guitar and on August 5, 1970, HAPPY END debuted. We were all raised on records. Rather, records gave birth to us. So to be recording... was like a dream for us. With our first album, we had no idea what we were doing. HAPPY END Matsumoto wrote lyrics for the song "Happy End." I think, I suggested making it our band name. I was driving and the others were in the car. It was in a car when I suggested we use "Happy End." It was the same with THE APRYL FOOL. A lot of ideas occur in cars. Oh, it's five o'clock. I'm going to exercise. It's been a while. We'll do it on stage too. This is to wake up... Maybe I'll go pee. "A Message" Neither Buffalo Springfield nor Moby Grape made it commercially but they are important teachers of music to me. They were a model to not only me but to rock music as a whole in the 1970s. HAPPY END was also squirming on the opposite spectrum to business but the two years we were active are still an influence on today. Commercialism plants a feeling of loss through lack of sales. Music-ism is not the same. It says, "Hey you. You might be great." "Even if you're not selling." The dissatisfaction from the first album became a motivation. There was still a lot to do. But with Kazemachi Roman I believe we overcame a lot of it. I thought it was better than our first work. Especially my singing. I was projecting my voice better. It was a kind of experiment. To combine Japanese words with West Coast Sound. We weren't thinking about sales or trying to become famous. It was an experiment based on just wanting to create. That experiment resulted in the creation of HAPPY END. After the members of HAPPY END created Kazemachi Roman, they each began their own paths. That was when a recording trip to LA was brought up. Recently, I went to LA and was surprised to find Sunset Sound Recorders. It still existed similar to when we were there. All the bands we liked had worked there. The fruits that we reaped there were huge. Van Dyke Parks appeared. It's Van Dyke. Amazing! - That was great. - Really? Thank you. Other way around. I didn't really know him at first. I knew about his work on "Good Vibrations" by The Beach Boys. He suddenly appeared and began lecturing. He was lecturing about Japan's Imperialism in English. I thought, "This is what he's like." As soon as recording began... he was fantastic. He told Takashi Matsumoto to hit the hi-hat at 16 beats. And add a dotted beat in the kick. Then play the guitar to the beat. That was how he gave direction. It was a process of building upwards. Learning how they put it together was a fresh discovery. As we began overdubbing Lowell George appeared. Van Dyke brought him. It was a great time. A miraculous experience. After returning from LA in 1972, Hosono and his family moved to America Village in Sayama where artists had started to gather. He began working on his first solo album, HOSONO HOUSE. CARAMEL MAMA... that was the band with Tatsuo Hayashi, Shigeru Suzuki and Masataka Matsutoya. Yoshino who was the engineer for Kazemachi Roman had bought a multi-channel recorder. We thought we'd try it out. We had it carried to us and we recorded at home. We were young. We rented a house and all slept there. It didn't feel like work. Rent was cheap and the house was big. It was very desirable. I was living at my parents' until then. I had no set address and no job. I had never written all the songs in an album. There was pressure to do well. I was barely a professional then. I was in my twenties. 23 or 24. I still had a strong instrumentalist mentality. I didn't know much about world-building yet. I wasn't looking to prove anything. That's why I re-made it recently. This first solo album that he put together was being listened to across borders and generations. There is a comic that is a good example. "Green's Song" by Taiwanese artist Gao Yan. - This is the Taiwanese version. - Oh yeah. - Can I see it? - Yes. Here. I read the Japanese version. - My heart was beating hard. - Thank you. It makes me very happy. The story was a big surprise for me. "Green's Song" is about a woman in Taiwan who is moved after her discovery of Hosono's music. After that, my feelings towards being an instrumentalist increased. Physically too, playing the bass was fun. That was when I got a letter from Okinawa. Makoto Kubota told me that he heard amazing music. He said that "Haisai Ojisan" was a huge hit there. When I listened to it, it was so interesting. I think that's where it began. Even though I was more of an instrumentalist I began wanting to create. It was the right moment when Kubota called me "tropical." He said "Hosono, you're a tropical dandy!" I thought, "That's it!" In the places where different cultures meet strange things grow. I became very curious. Tropicalism has that kind of quality. I thought I could make a solo album. I quickly made TROPICAL DANDY. I listened to a lot of quirky music and feeling good, I made TROPICAL DANDY and Bon Voyage co. But that didn't last long. When I returned back to normalcy I made PARAISO. That one feels different. I was a little depressed. Searching for some kind of answer I read Tadanori Yokoo's India. I thought, "If I go to India, I can get diarrhea." "Diarrhea is a cleanse! I can reset myself." INDIA BY YOKOO TADANORI INDIA BY YOKOO TADANORI For some reason, I went to Yokoo's studio. Then he asked me if I wanted to go to India. For a second, I hesitated. - When I said we should go? - Yes. No, you didn't hesitate. You said, "Let's go" as soon as I invited you. There was no time for hesitation. It wasn't hesitation. I was just struck. Ah, you were struck. - Looking back, it was good. - I didn't think that would actually happen. Only the two of us fell ill. Hosono had it worse. I had been ill like this before so I knew what was up. It was Hosono's first time so he thought he was dying. - More like he became very flat. - Yes. He was sleeping on the bed but he's not much higher than the bed. So flat. Yes! I became flat and flimsy. He was no longer a 3D human but a flat person. A sheet of paper. Now, I'm wondering whatever happened to that couple. The wife had a psychic quality to her. Super psychic. The wife saw Hosono and said, "You are like Buddha." Yes, as everything came out. Diarrhea didn't matter to you. You're Buddha. Buddha died from diarrhea too. The wife said, "Let's eat together." I think it was salmon and congee. Was it congee? - It was white rice. - It was rice. She said I'll be better if I eat this. So Yokoo and I ate it. And when we did, we were both cured. You and I have done so many talks together. There's nobody I've done as many talks with. Sorry. How long has it been? 40 or 50 years? It's over a long period. We've talked about the same things. That's what's funny. That's because we always end up talking about the past. "Hosono's Dream Diary" "The Soft-Biting Frog" I had a dream. I am being chased. I end up at a rural harbor I do not recognize. Perhaps today is a holiday. The big building is unpopulated and seafood is strewn across the floor. What is that? Something strange. One large shellfish is attacking. It spins towards the direction I walk. It's a very alert shellfish. Once I enter an even bigger space, I see one small tree frog wandering about. It's disgruntled and muttering something in a low voice. When it saw me, it jumped from 10 meters away and bit onto my wrist. But it didn't hurt. That was because it was a soft bite. Chomp, chomp. It was the press conference announcing the start of Alfa Records. I was sitting and someone told me to say something. We had nothing decided. But the words "Yellow Magic Orchestra" suddenly came to me. I said that's what I'm doing. But I had nothing. No members either. I don't remember why but I tapped Yukihiro Takahashi. Yukihiro and I were friends from way back. He was in a band called sadistics. He came running straight at me like an arrow. His eyes were shining. From there, I tapped Ryuichi Sakamoto. I used to see Sakamoto at the studio. I knew him as an arranger. He came begrudgingly. He said he's never been in a band. I said, "Use me as your footstool to the world." The notebook that Hosono used at his house to explain the concept behind YMO included the musical direction and sales goals. They were written in concrete terms. GOAL: 4 MILLION COPIES. Empty promises. It was because there was one unenthused person. I was thinking that I have to convince him. So I did a presentation of what was possible and what we were aiming for. I drew pictures like this. It was partly a joke. When I showed them this, it was a go. What I knew for sure was to do "Firecracker" using a computer. But at first, we thought to try it with live instruments... without a computer. It wasn't interesting. Nothing new came out of it. I thought the computer was the right way to go. So we tried a computer straight away. It was music that didn't exist before. There are things that a human can't do like a perfectly even rhythm. I didn't have to play the bass. I was upset at first. I think the most upsetting part was that I didn't have anything to do. It meant that I was able to put my efforts into producing. YMO was after all a project. I was going to quit if it didn't work out. But once we began, it became play. At the end of the day... it's fun to play. And then... like a roll of a die, things kept rolling in a good direction. The three of us were in the studio watching TV. Seiji Ozawa in Beijing was big news because he was conducting the symphony orchestra. You could see the joy from the Chinese orchestra members for being able to play music that had been taboo. The joy was infectious. They had great postures and they kept smiling. And they had techno haircuts. All three of us said, "That's it!" We liked their innocent attitudes and their haircuts. Then came our second album. Things began to change because of "Rydeen." The popularity of "Rydeen" was a phenomenon that we witnessed after our return from our first world tour. Our world tour was also feeding back to Japan. There was a boy who followed me when I walked the streets. The schoolboy had a baseball cap on. When I turned around he hid behind a pole and still followed. I was puzzled. "Rydeen" really was at our height. The record company of course asked for another "Rydeen." But we couldn't. We couldn't do the same thing. I don't know if it was out of spite but we made BGM which was an extremely avant-garde album. Kids still listened to it. We were caught in a whirlpool we couldn't predict. We were all over the media and treated as musicians and cultural figures. We have a tendency to please and did a lot. But we did too much and we were getting tired. Sakamoto was depressed. I was depressed too. Yukihiro was getting tired of going between us. Through all this we were gradually starting to feel its end. YMO who did not do much in 1992 put out "Kimi ni Mune Kyun" in March of 1983. They appeared in public again. They continued to work hard until their final concert in December. We all became close again when we started doing pop songs. We felt free to do whatever after this. Once we get to the house, we'll do this dance. What exactly are you pulling? You grab something here. Like making mochi. You have light steps! When was the last time you were all together? I see Yukihiro often. It's been a while since I saw Sakamoto. Two years? I always hear about him so I feel like I see him more. I was expecting a long night since it had been a while for you all. But everyone seemed anxious to get home. - People were tired. - That's true. Sakamoto is busy too. But you spent a lot of time together. A lot happened but it was fun. I can guess that a lot happened. Bands are difficult. Did you fight? We never threw punches or anything. Doing a session together after a few years... did you feel a difference in your worldviews? Depends. The thing with musicians is that even if it's been a while... you can play like you saw them just yesterday. Yukihiro Takahashi. Oyamada from Cornelius. Is Sakamoto around too? I was surprised. I was worried I'm being rude. Don't worry. No hierarchy. Why don't you go bow? I'd feel bad since there's the next one. I'm exhausted. - Thank you. - It was truly great. We messed up the end. I guess it's been about 10 years since we've done a show together. Time doesn't matter though. This is all very mysterious. I didn't plan for it. We happened to gather here. I don't know why. There's probably a reason. We were meant to come together. It was improvised. In a real sense. The way people around the world listen to music these days is different from 10 years ago. No matter the country, music-lovers are listening to good music in the same way. They can listen to music today and 40 years ago side-by-side. It made me think that that's how they're listening to my work too. I want to do fun things. It'll be fine as long as there are music lovers. We're Hosono's groupies. "TENGOKU NO KISS" SEIKO MATSUDA It was around the time that Hosono was in YMO that he began to provide songs to pop artists like Seiko Matsuda. "NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND" "NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND" During this period, he worked on many hits. In 1982, he started a label called YEN. Using the most advanced sampling machine of the time, He released his solo album PHILHARMONY 4 years after COCHIN MOON. Two years after that, he started another label called NON-STANDARD. Campanella! His first soundtrack was for Night on the Galactic Railroad in 1985. After the mid-80s, he worked on ambient, world and electronic music and various genres depending on the times. It could only be done then. If I want to, I can just gather old equipment. But I can't say that. I have to do what is of its time. That's why it's interesting. The works are evidence that I did my best in that time. Those works are interesting to listen to today. They're fresh. If we did what others did and we were bored by it... we wouldn't be able to listen to it now. Work made with a lot of effort is still interesting today. This includes ideas and processes. They're full of trials and errors. Excuse me. If only I could smoke. That's besides the point. - Are cigarettes a necessity? - Yes. - Do you feel it's needed for your music? - Yes. May I ask why? A puff of smoke is very musical. I do it like I'm creating a puff of music. When you're smoking? I mean that they're similar. To go back to Dylan for example... he sticks a cigarette in the neck of his guitar when he records. Keith Richards did too. I was influenced by that. I did it too. I feel relaxed when I see smoke. I can't do this. They're reacting to my songs. They've really been listening. The first foreigner who appeared in front of me was Jim O'Rourke. I had never met an American who knew HAPPY END. Mac DeMarco... has a similar sensibility to O'Rourke. They're not nerds but they like music in a universal way. This is Gen Hoshino. Let me introduce our guest. - Haruomi Hosono! - Good evening! Thank you for coming. You work hard at a late hour. - Sorry it's so late. - Oh no, I'll do my best. Yes, please. How old were you when we first met? In my twenties... maybe 26? - Right. - It was around then. Back when you did shows at China Town you had a beard. - You wore a white suit. - As Harry Hosono. Yes, we first met when I had my Harry Hosono costume on. Yes... I thought you might be taken aback but you were kind to me. I thought you were a funny person. I've known Hoshino since his SAKEROCK days. Since then, he's found a different style to call his own. Generationally speaking... I do feel that things are getting passed on. When we played in Yokohama's China Town... I was MC-ing and said, "I'm leaving it to you, Hoshino." "I'll leave the rest to you." I say that a lot these days. That's all true. "I'll leave the rest to you all." What was it? "Pom Pom Jyoki" It'll be over quickly. Let's do it. Here is my question for the Fourth IGA WATARU SHOW. Is there anything you're good at other than music? That I'm good at? Nothing. How about dance? I was very good in middle school. Did you study it? Study... no. I'm very good at silly walks. - There's one called the Mars Walk. - Mars Walk? Mars like the planet. - Walking on Mars? - Yeah, like walking on Mars. It's very childish. That's all I have. Nothing I can do. I'm useless. What else? I stopped drawing too. You used to draw? I liked to draw especially during class. - You weren't listening in class? - No. So maybe if I take a class I can do something. You'll be better at drawing if you enroll in a class? DOOR OF THE TIMES Every time your talk about a film it becomes the talk of the town. Every time your talk about a film it becomes the talk of the town. Yeah? Any recommendations from some recent viewings? My favorite films are ones I'm looking forward to seeing. Once I see them, I'm always disappointed. Thank you. Oh, that's it? On a final note, what music are you listening to these days? I like music before I listen to them. Amazing. Thank you. I'm glad the rain has stopped. I'm sure it was a difficult wait. Thank you. I lived here 30 years ago a little south from here. The house no longer exists but it had an American vibe to it. I suddenly received an offer. I had a connection with Sayama where I made HOSONO HOUSE. It was supposed to be an one-off live event. But it rained a lot that day and the crowd went to the station. When it was my turn the rain stopped and people came back. Steam seemed to rise from them. It was an inexplicably mysterious view. It left a very strong impression on me. I don't like singing. So I refused doing shows. There's a limit to how many songs I can enjoy singing. But as I began doing more shows I found that I was able to sing more. It became more fun for me. I also realized that singing songs by others was even more fun. I thought, "That's good. I can cover songs I like." I used to hate singing but it started to become fun. Oh? I didn't know. I'm embarrassed. "Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens" is a difficult boogie. It's fun for me to sing, right now. It's a famous boogie. I didn't think I could sing it. But I just liked it so much... so I started practicing. I had the band play it during rehearsals. I was able to sing it after doing it over and over. Now, I can sing it from memory. That's fun. When my desire to sing becomes intense, I'm able to do it. It's working! I've turned into a comedian. The thing that I want to do most right now... For example, there's the boogie-woogie and there are many bands that are doing the same songs I am. But when I tried checking them out... I just didn't get excited. But when I listen to the originals from the 1940s... my heart dances whenever I do. These current bands are lacking something. I don't want to lose that something. There's something very special there... a secret... It's a secret? Yeah, or something hard to communicate. Like a secret recipe? Yeah, without that secret sauce it just becomes boring. Without that, I wouldn't do it. It wouldn't be fun. The key for me is freedom. When I touch what's free, my heart dances. Thank you very much. Wonderful.
