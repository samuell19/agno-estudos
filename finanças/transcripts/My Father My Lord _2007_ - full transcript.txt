"My Lord, the soul You have given me is pure. "You created it, You formed it, "You breathed it into me, You guard it Within me, "and one day You Will take it from me and restore it to me in life eternal. "As long as this soul is Within me, "I thank You, my Lord, Lord of my forefathers, "Master of all creation, Sovereign of all souls. "Blessed are You, Lord, Who restores souls to dead bodies." "I gratefully thank You, O living and eternal King..." Look. You naughty boy. That's it. Finish your chocolate milk, and let's go. We don't Want to keep Dad Waiting. - Dead Sea Minibus Service - Let's see if you knoW. The arm Tefillin correspond to the heart and the head Tefillin to the brain. Good. Which do you start With? The arm Tefillin or the head Tefillin? The arm Tefillin and then the head Tefillin. What's the blessing for each one? The blessing for arm Tefillin is "To put on Tefillin," and for head Tefillin is "The commandment of Tefillin." If We Want you to have proper, fancy tefillin We have to order several years in advance, even 4 or 5 years before your Bar-Mitzvah. Everyone together.

Are We going to the beach this year, Mom? Did Dad speak to you? - No. He didn't tell you When I sent you to talk to him yesterday? -No. Strange. Here's the phone number of a minibus service for the Dead Sea. Do you prefer the Dead Sea? I have an idea. Why don't We hire a private transport? Hi, Menahem. Menahem seggested We go to the Dead Sea. That's a good idea. Why don't We take a private transport? You knoW What? I'll inquire about that tomorroW. Menahem, What blessing do you say When you see the sea? "Whose poWer and might pervade the World." "Who makes the Wonders of creation." Most people actually agree that you don't bless the Dead Sea, only the great sea. Do dogs have souls? Absolutely not. Why do you think so? Do you think dogs are like humans? Why do you ask? Even good animals don't have a heaven to go to? Menahem. They have no Will. No sins. No commandments. Nothing. Someone's playing the drums. - Are they Worshipping an idol? I don't knoW. Dad, can you come here? Say, is this idolatry? It is idolatry. It is. They're Worshipping an idol? Menahem, I don't knoW if they're Worshipping, but it is idolatry. Idolatry! It should be torn up. Tear it up, Menahem. Tear it up, Menahem! Tear it up, Menahem. Do you Want to have idolatry in our home? Do you? Tear it up noW! Do you understand?! -Dad. I Will have no idolatry in this house! Tear it up! Dad... maybe Menahem Will tear it up and... We'll get you another picture instead of it. A reWard for tearing up idolatry? Next, you'll be reWarding him for observing the Sabbath. Tear it up, Menahem. Are you sleeping? Have you recited the "Giver of Sleep"? Good night. Women aren't alloWed in here. - Alright. I Won a lot of jacks. - Lovely! Come and see What I got you. Hey, here are the beach sandals. Here. NeW bathing suit. I got you fruit. I'm very busy, so... I've got a couple of things I have to do. I'll come and pick you up and We'll go back home together. Quick. Women aren't alloWed in here. -Alright. Good. Not here. Not here. Okay. Goodbye, Menahem. See you. 16 and 16. - 32. 32 and 32. - 64. -Good! What are you looking for, Menahem? -The Water Wings. There they are. Is that too tight, Menahem? - No. -Great. You don't have to knoW hoW to sWim in the Dead Sea. You just raise your arms and legs and float. Where's Dad's thermos? Do you knoW Where Dad's thermos is? I don't knoW. We can use my thermos. - Oh, great. Thanks. I Want to hold it. - Careful... By the Way the Talmud says: "Had We not been given the Torah We Would learn modesty from cats." For cats burroW in the dirt and cover their Waste. Rabbi Haim's innovation is that since the Torah Was given to us, We have to learn the rules of modesty from the Torah and not from the cat, as the Torah is the only thing that obliges us. There's an important faith issue here. Our sages have taught us that the Almighty has tWo types of providence When Watching the World: General Providence and Personal Providence. In General Providence, the Almighty takes care of all the species in nature, seeing to their continued existence as species and kinds, not as individuals. God doesn't Watch over individuals in the animal and plant kingdoms. When an animal eats another one or a man steps on an ant, it's not because the Almighty decided that that ant should die right then. He instituted natural cycles in them, Which proceed according to His decree and He doesn't take into account What happens to them as individuals. The Almighty provided Personal Providence for man alone. The Almighty decrees an individual's destiny and What happens to him every moment. But here, one must understand that by "man", they meant only the righteous man Who Worships God. God doesn't Watch over those Who don't observe the Torah and, naturally, doesn't Watch over those Who aren't JeWs With Personal Providence. Only With General Providence. And the entire purpose of people Who do not Worship God in this World is to serve the righteous man. And they Were created on account of him, just like inanimate objects, animals and plants. As of themselves, they Would not have the right to exist Were it not for the righteous man, Who is the purpose of all Creation. It is only the God Worshipper, a man of Torah that the Almighty protects With Personal Providence, Watching over him every step of his Way and seeing to all his needs for it is for the righteous man that the World Was created. "Blessed are You, the Lord, our God, King of the universe, "through Whose Word everything came to be." Why does the Almighty keeps the species and kinds from extinction. We don't knoW. But We do knoW that everything Was created for the Torah. And this is Where the Talmud says: "Had We not been given the Torah, We Would learn modesty from the cats," indicating that this might be the reason Why cats Were created as they Were. That is, any reason that benefits the servant of God is Worthy of being part of Creation. And it is Written: "If not for my covenant, Which is the Torah, "I Would have not established the ordinances of heaven and earth." "Bless God, the blessed One. "Blessed is God, the blessed One, for all eternity." Menahem... We're going to the Dead Sea tomorroW. Have you said your last blessing? Let's say the last blessing. "Blessed are You..." "Blessed are You, the Lord our God," "King..." - "King of the Universe "Who created many souls and their needs, "for What He created to instill all lives in. "Blessed are the lives, eternal." You're up? You already recited the "Giver of Sleep"... Good night, Esther. You're tired, eh? Esther. What? I don't understand. What...? What are you thinking about? Esther. Are you a little mad at me? "Blessed are You, O Lord our God, "Who casts the bonds of sleep upon my eyes "and slumber upon my eyelids. "May it be Your Will O Lord, and God of my ancestors "that you lay me doWn With peace and raise me up in peace." Mordechai, come here. Put the cellophane. on the fire in the altar. This one too. Come, help us. Put this here. Good. We've glued Abraham here. NoW, let's attach the altar. Who's going to help me? Come, Mendi, come. Let me put some glue here... Go to the table and get some more glue. Very nice. Put this here. Glue it here. Nice. So We have Abraham, the altar With the Wood and Isaac and here's the ram. Menahem's gluing the ram noW. Come. NoW the ram. Let's glue it strongly. Menahem, they've come to pick you up. See you. Rabbi Abraham... "I am ready and prepared to perform the commandment "of sending aWay the mother bird as it says in Your holy Torah." "You must let the mother go, and only then take the young." "For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, "by the One Who is hidden and concealed, "in the name of all Israel." "Blessed are You, O Lord our God, "Who has sanctified us With His commandments "and commanded us to send aWay the mother bird." The dove fleW from the nest. Where? The dove from the nest at Torah school. Does she have young ones? - Yes. TWo little ones. "O Master of the Universe, "our Father, Merciful Father. "Fulfill my heart and my Wife's heart's desires to do good, "to purify our thoughts and bodies, "to direct our bodies "so as to increase Your sanctity in all Worlds. "And may We be blessed With sons and daughters "Who are alive and Well to Work You and be in aWe of You. "May they do Your Will, truly, all the days of their lives." Okay, We can go. Your hand. Menahem. Do you knoW the commandment of "sending aWay the mother bird"? "Ki Tetzeh" Weekly Torah portion? "If you come across a bird's nest along the Way..." Well? "If you come across a bird's nest along the Way, "You must let the mother go, and only then take the young." What do you do? You let the mother go, and leave the young. It's a commandment. - Why? It's the commandment of "sending aWay the mother bird"... It's a commandment from the Torah. So What happens to the young ones? They're there... And you return them. So What happened to the mother? What happened to the mother... I guess she'll return. And if she doesn't, the young ones Won't have a mother anymore? Maybe she Will return? Of course she'll return, Menahem. Why Wouldn't she? Do you think anyone can be more merciful and righteous than the Torah? I Want you to knoW that mercifulness that contradicts the Torah is sometimes an evil instinct disguised as a good one. We do everything that is Written in the Torah Without asking Why, because those are the laWs of the Almighty. In fact... after sending aWay the dove, the Almighty sees her sorroW and his pity is aroused on account of the destruction of the Second Temple and the exile of the JeWs. And this is the real sorroW of the World. It's amazing. The commandment of "sending aWay the mother bird" is a promise for sons. Our Sages of Blessed Memory said the folloWing: "Thus said the Almighty: "'If you don't have sons, I Will give you sons.' HoW so? "For it is said: 'Send aWay the mother.' "And What is your reWard? Take the young." Here's the sea. So beautiful. "HoW many are Your Works, O Lord." Where shall We go? Will We be on the same beach or go to a separate one? Mom's going to the Women's beach and We're going to the groWnups' beach. You go With Dad. Menahem, you're a big boy. You'll have your Bar-Mitzvah in a feW years. But Dad, there really Were fish there. I saW... Yes, Menahem. Those are fish from the rainfall Water, from the springs. When they go into the Dead Sea Water, they die. Its salty Water. I don't Want to go into the Water With my sandals on. But Why did We get you sandals? I Want to go barefoot. So be careful, don't slip in this Water. This Water really stings. It Will hurt your eyes. Careful. What happened? What happened? Get some Water from the beach, fast. From the spring... Afternoon prayer! Out, out of the Water! Get out of the Water! Afternoon prayer! Menahem! Menahem! Come. We're late for prayers. Pants first. Leg... What are you doing? They're on Wrong. Okay. There. NoW it's Okay. Go on. One. Other leg... Other leg. One, tWo... Jump. Good boy. Hold on. NoW, sandals. I Want to do the other one. But We're hurrying to pray. We've got to get ready for prayers. I'll go, Will you folloW me? - Okay. Sure? -Yes. - I'm Waiting for you. -Okay. Menahem! Menahem! Come on! Menahem! I'm coming. I'm coming. "I Will lift up my eyes to the mountains, from Where shall my help come?" "A song of Ascents. "I Will lift up my eyes to the mountains, "from Where shall my help come? "A Song of Ascents. I Will lift up my eyes to the mountains, "from Where shall my help come? "My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. "My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. "He Will not alloW your foot to slip, "He Who keeps you Will not slumber. "He Will not alloW your foot to slip, "He Who keeps you Will not slumber. "Behold, He Who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. "Behold, He Who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. "The Lord is your shade on your right hand. "The Lord is your shade on your right hand. "The sun Will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. "The sun Will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night." "God gave "and God has taken aWay." "Blessed be the name of God "from noW to all eternity." "We have been broken. Blessed be the Judge of truth. "With torn hearts, seething, With hearts broken, in deep sorroW, "We announce our premature bereavement. "Our only, beloved, dear son, "Menahem Eidelman, of blessed memory." "Let Your affection for him be sWeeter "than a honeycomb or any other delicacy. "Glorious One, most beautiful splendor of the World, "my soul is sick With love for You. "Please God, heal it "by revealing the delight of your splendor. "Then it Will be invigorated and healed, "enjoying everlasting happiness." Esther, You mustn't cry on the Sabbath. "...And have pity "on Your beloved son. "This is the desire of my heart. "Have pity and do not hide Yourself." Why don't you muster up some energy and come With me? I never let him out of my sight. Suddenly, for a moment, I Wasn't by his side. Esther, I Was Wrapped in the hands of the Almighty. I Was... engrossed in praying. What could I do? I Was Wrapped in the hands of the Almighty. What could one do? Man can't do more. If he had been With me... - Menahem Eidelman - Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd.
