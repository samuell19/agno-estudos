♪♪ [Muzak] Ah! Here they are. You say you forgot your prescription, Father? I did. I'm so sorry. I left it on my dresser. I could run home and get it... Oh, no. That won't be necessary, Father. You're, uh, you're from the abbey, right? Yes, I am. You tell Father Abbott that Red Clemens said hello. I will do that. Thank you for these. God bless. Goodbye. [distant chanting] It's about time, Luther. What took you so long? Traffic. Been starin' at the Blessed Sacrament for an hour. I swear, the crucifix has been eyeing me for the past 20 minutes. Yeah, well, Catholic guilt. You know how it is. Got your stuff. You did? How'd you pull it off? It was a little harder than usual. It's gonna cost you twice what you usually pay. Fine, fine, whatever. Hand 'em over. Where's my money? Have it up in my room. Then you get these when I get my money. What do you want? [Louis] Hey, Luther, give me one of your movies, and, um, something to drink. DVD or VHS? DVD. Who was that? Louis. You kept all this stuff? Yeah. You know, I didn't think it was possible, but you have definitely gotten uglier over time. You're just pissed off 'cause I struck you out that whole week. That's a total figment of your imagination. You know it. Ah. So how much do you make in a week? I do all right. I can't believe you haven't been caught yet. You're not gonna be able to get away with this forever. Who says? I swear, you say anything, you're dead. I won't. Good. Haven't yet. Want a beer? Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, sure, no problem. That's four bucks. Don't be late for night prayers, boys. Senator Givens. Pleasure to finally meet you. Likewise, Father Thomas. And I do apologize for having to change this to tonight from tomorrow afternoon, but I have to leave town first thing in the morning. You understand. Understood. Good. This is my wife, Sarah. Hello, Sarah. And our son, Benjamin. Ben, nice to meet you. Well, wanna have a tour? Sure. Absolutely. It's 10:00. You better hurry if you're gonna make it to night prayers. Why don't you come with me for once? I don't think so. You're pious enough for the both of us. How many night prayers have you missed in three years? Zero. Don't go. I like to go. What? Fine. No, go. Why not? You wanna work off that beer? Stay here and help me. Help you with what? I'll open a classroom for you, Benjamin, so you can see for yourself where the boys spend most of their time. What do you think, Benny? It's great. ♪♪ [rap] I don't have a lot right now, but I'll make the next run by tomorrow, okay? Remember, no one steps foot into my room, you pay me first, and you get what you want, got it? Is that clear? Bruce. [Givens] Well, all right. What about the dorms, Father? I'm sure Benjy would like to see the students in their natural habitat. This isn't the Discovery Channel, Charles. It's a joke, dear. It's just a joke. Well, most of the boys here are at night prayer right now, but I don't see why we can't pay a surprise visit to the ones that are still studying. Good. Come on. Dude, just shut... Please, Alfred, shut up. Just shut up. Just for today. Please, just for today. If you have four bucks, we can do business. Come on. Just take three just for today. Four dollars a beer. Just for today, though. I'll pay you back. Vince. Yeah. What are you doing? Uh... I'll get you back on Friday, Luther. What are you doing? Are you paying attention? What happened? [sighs] Look, hold onto this. Sell the rest to whoever's got the most money. I'll be back. Yo, Luther! No, dude, check it before you wreck it. [laughs] Oh, man. You likey? That's perfect. That's perfect. There's a four-pack of wine coolers under the sink. They're yours. You're the man. Hang it up while you're at it. ♪♪ [rap continues] Scott. Scott! Where's my eight bucks? Man, I thought you gave me those beers. Scott. Uh, dude, Father Thomas is coming up the steps. What? [Luther] Shit. Hey, Nick! Move! That's it, that's it. We're closed. Come on, man. Enough! Look, get in bed, pretend you're sleeping. Father Thomas is coming. Holy crap. That's what we like to call him. ♪♪ [rap continues] Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink! [shouting, laughing] Whoo! ♪♪ [rap continues] Whoo-ooo-ooh! Benny! Just... Just get in the goddamn car. Father, I don't know what kind of institution you think you're running here, but if you think that I'm gonna subject my child to an environment that encourages this sort of outrageous behavior, you are sadly mistaken. Let's go, Clyde! And you can forget that contribution we talked about. [engine starts] [car door closes] [car drives away] Next! This is great, just great. Someone is gonna tell. No one's gonna tell. Everyone who would tell was at night prayers. Father Thomas knows how to apply pressure. He'll get someone to talk. Relax. For the first few weeks, he's gonna be strict. We'll have to mop the dining hall or something like that. Next month, we'll be back to selling beers and Playboys. You don't have to worry. I do have to worry. I'm on scholarship, Luther. My parents can't afford St. Michael's. One strike, and I'll be sent home. You know what that's like. Just take it easy. You always get me in trouble. Don't be pushing blame onto me, okay? You chose, Robbie. You made a choice, okay? Remember, it was my father who got you the scholarship and out of that shithole your parents call a house. Just don't wanna get into trouble, that's all. Then let me do the talking, okay? Okay. We're not gonna get into trouble for this. I promise. You boys are in serious trouble. Do you have any idea the consequences you've brought upon yourselves? Your behavior is atrocious. It's shocking. Inexcusable. Dismissal. It's the only thing I can tell you. You boys will be dismissed. Father, what are you talking about? Oh, shut up, Luther! I know all of your escapades. I have a file on you this thick! You're a very smart young man, but you're also very stupid. Do you realize the sins you brought upon yourselves and the influence you have brought upon others? This is ridiculous, Father. I have no idea what you're talking about. I was in my room studying when this happened. You are a liar, and by the end of next week, you will be dismissed from this school. And you, too, Robbie. I'm sorry. Kindly give me the keys to the locker. Both you boys report to my office first thing in the morning. Get out. Get out. [ball bouncing] What are you doing? Don't you have any work to do? I'm just waiting for Robbie. He's getting all his stuff. Why don't you go up and change? Shouldn't be washing cars in your school uniform. Sure. Have a great time in town. Luther, any more tricks from you, and I will make sure that this last week here is something you remember. Now, why don't you just concentrate on leaving St. Michael's as a gentleman. This we've trained you to be. Jerk-off. What are you doing? Go on and get dressed, man. We got three cars to wash today, and I'd like take a nap before my next class. Wish I could help you out, but I gotta take care of something. How long is he gonna be gone for? He's got a mass in town and a meeting with school administration. He should be gone until after dinner. Perfect. Hold on. Thank you...-ish. What, I'm supposed to just wash three cars by myself? What, do you think he's gonna check anyway? Where do you think you're going? That is none of your business. You suck, you know that? God loves you, too. Well, hello there, young man. Hi, Mother. How are you? I haven't see you since, uh, Ash Wednesday, right? It's nice to see you again. Nice to see you, Mother. So... I was just on my break. I thought I'd stop in church for a quick prayer. Oh, of course. I hopped the fence 'cause I didn't wanna disrupt the girls. You don't have to worry about that. I'll see to it that you don't disrupt the girls. Now then, Luther, I am going off to teach my Latin class, and in 45 minutes, I will walk this campus again. Uh-huh. I do not want to see... those baby-blues at that time. Yes, Mother. Bravo. Ta-ta! Ah... Come here often? Yeah, sometimes. You know, to pick up chicks. Yeah? Does it work? I don't know. You tell me. Yeah, it works. What are you doing here? I had to see you. Oh. And I thought it was gonna be another boring day. Nah. No? [laughs] Come on. Uh, I got kicked out of school. [chuckles] Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I said. Evidently, God doesn't really care. What happened? I was selling stuff to some kids in my class, and some kid told Father Thomas, and that's that. And they expect me to go to class and church and meals until the end of the week, pretend like nothing's happened. And I got Father Thomas breathing down my neck, and I have to face my father on Friday. You're leaving me. Where are your parents going to send you? Uh, my dad went nuts. He's talking about some military school in D.C. But look, I turn 18 in six weeks. They can't make me go anywhere. Then what are you gonna do? You're graduating this year. I was thinking... maybe I'd follow you. What? Well, why not? You're the only reason I've been able to handle this school and these people. Luther, this is a huge step. I mean, this is more than just a step. This is a leap of faith, you know. And you've never been one to trust in faith. Please don't give me that Jesus-freak crap right now. I'm just saying this isn't a rational way of solving a problem. What is that supposed to mean? I don't think you're in the right state of mind to be making this kind of decision. God, I mean, out of everybody, I thought, you know, maybe... maybe you'd understand me. And I might not have that faith you talk about, Jamie, but I expected you to have it for me. I do have faith in you. No, you don't. Luther, just come... No. Stop. I... I can't believe I thought I was falling in love with you. Watch it, Bennett! What's your problem? How you doin', David? Let's talk, huh? I don't... I don't wanna talk right now. Oh. Tired of talking. Look, I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll grab a book, and we'll study together. How's that sound? David. Bennett. Luther! Hold on one second, Father. Luther! David! Luther! What? If you're going to walk out of here with that, you need to check it out with me. If you're not, please put it away. You put it away. Morals have become so distorted and forgotten that society's become basically numb to violence. We've become violently desensitized. Welcome back. We're so used to the dramatized violence in the media that real occurrences don't seem to bother us anymore. This leads to acceptance and sometimes participation in these unruly acts. Gentlemen, I tell you, we have become habituated to this trap. We've lost an innocence and a purity that we will never regain. Ever. [class bell rings] Don't forget. Tomorrow, oral exam. That's it. We're all going to hell. You've been habituated. Habituated! Luther. Nice work. Punk! I was wondering what he was doing up there. He always goes to night prayers. Who? Bennett. David? Any other school, that kid would've had his head kicked in by now. David Bennett told on us? Yes, David Bennett told! What, do you not understand me? Yes. [speaking Latin] Yes. He told Father Thomas everything. That's the reason why I'm spending my senior year in a military school. That's the reason why you lost your scholarship. Come on, Luther, this is your fault. Please don't give me this shit right now! It is, all right? You were the one selling all that stuff! Lie all you want to yourself, but don't do it to me. Keep your lessons to yourself. How about you keep it to yourself? You stupid son of a bitch. Hey, watch your mouth! You don't wanna hit me. You don't know what I want. It's him. It's him! Him who? Bennett? Yeah. No. Oh... No way. Nice try. I'm not getting into any more trouble. Oh, come on. You know he deserves it. You see the smile on that kid's face? It's not true. Besides, what are they gonna do? They gonna kick us out again? David, where you going? Ricky, I'm gonna go to confession. You're going now? Yeah. Father Kelly says confession tonight till 10:30. Okay. See you later. Father, it's me. David, it's always good to see you. Do you mind if we go face-to-face? No, not at all. Well, let's begin. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Amen. How long has it been since your last confession? 30 days. And what would you like to confess? Well... yesterday I got some people in trouble. I told on them for something. Did you do it out of anger, spite, concern? I guess I just wanted to tell. Now they're gonna get kicked out. It wasn't anger, but I don't think I did it for the right reasons either. It's hard to explain. Is that a sin? Well, your intentions were for the best. So for that reason, I'd like you to pray for these boys at tomorrow night's adoration. Okay. Is that it? That was it, Father. Well, you've made an honest confession. Now make a true act of contrition. O my God, I am heartily sorry for all my sins. Because of them, I deserve the eternal pains of hell. But most of all because I have offended Thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace to confess my sins, to do penance, to avoid the proximate occasion of sin and never to sin again. Amen. Et ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. The Lord has freed you of your sins. Now go in peace. Amen. Thank you, Father. God bless you, David. [groaning] Shh! Shh! Be quiet. Look, follow him out front. Go! Go! [whispers] Father! Father! Father! No! Help me! Do you have any idea what you did, Bennett? Do you? I know. I'm sorry! Luther! You want to die? Do you? No! No! Luther, that's enough! I'm sorry! Shut up! Help! Help! Luther, he's slipping! Luther... No! [bone cracks] Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening. No. Luther... Luther? What are we gonna do? Hey. Hey, please. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up right now! Luther, we killed him. You killed him. [coughs] Luther, what are we gonna do? Luther, answer me! Shut your mouth! Help me lift him. What? Help me lift the legs. Wanna get in trouble? Pick his legs up and help me get him out of here. No. You just killed David Bennett. No one knows that but you and me, right? Right? Isn't that right, Robbie? You got blood on your clothes. You just worry about yourself. You remember what I told you. You think this is gonna undo itself? He's dead. Just do what I say. You don't have to worry about anything. Like the last time I just did what you said. Now I'm going to prison. Don't you get it, Robbie? Come on! It's his fault! He wanted to die. He pushed himself off that thing. I didn't push him. Oh, God! God's got nothing to do with this. You think He loves you? He doesn't love us. But He can't break us. As long as I... As long as you and I stay together, He won't break us. Right, Robbie? Robbie, promise me. Robbie. Promise me. Robbie! [tires screech] [car door closes] [door closes] In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. How long has it been since your last confession? Would you like me to hear your confession, or would you like spiritual guidance? Father, I... I just... I just killed someone. Oh... [groans] [sobs] [sobbing] Okay. [sobs] It just happened about maybe 10 minutes ago. [sobbing] Where? Where? Where did this happen? How? It was at the school. It was at the school. But I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. [exhales] I had him against the rail... and I just kept on pushing and pushing. I didn't know when to stop. He had me so angry. I just get so angry. And then Robbie couldn't help. He was on the ground. Robbie? Why would you... It was David Bennett, Father. You don't understand what he did to me. You just don't understand. I just wanted to hurt him a little. I just killed someone. I just killed someone. You told Father Kelly? In confession. "No one but you and me." Remember that? I told him in confession. He'd be excommunicated if he said anything. What if he does? Asshole. What's your problem? What's my problem? You are! You left me out there last night alone with the body of a dead kid. Don't do anything stupid, Robbie. What, tell on you? You won't be that stupid. What do you know? [sirens approaching] [church bells ringing] Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the incarnation of Christ Thy Son was made known by the message of an angel, [sirens approaching] may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen. [sirens turn off] [police radio chatter] You wouldn't know, but this place brings lots of bad memories for me. Let's go. Fuck. What are you looking at? All right, boys, find something to do. Sorry, Father. Father, I'm Detective Mallory. Please come with me. Watch your step. This is Detective Fletcher. He's in charge of the investigation. Father. Mr. Fletcher. Good to meet you. I just arrived from out of state. No one has told me anything. I'm sorry. They're not allowed to say anything till I get here. It's just protocol. What an absolute tragedy. [Fletcher] Yes, it is. Father Thomas, I appreciate your cooperation. I know you're very busy. Well, a matter this grave, I'm glad to help in any way possible. [police radio chatter] I'll get that, Lieutenant. Thanks, Ronnie. Okay, so why don't we start? Listen, Mr. Fletcher, I just wanna say I think it is highly unlikely that young Bennett was murdered. Why would you say that, Father? By whom? To what purpose? We're a school here. We provide safety and community for all our youngsters. Father, young people, they commit murder, too. Trust me. St. Michael's doesn't breed young people. We breed young men. Young men studied extensively in languages and the arts, and we have a very strict admissions process that spans two months. And then after that, the boys themselves arrive with their parents, and they witness the school firsthand. What I'm trying to say, Mr. Fletcher, is we don't just let in anyone. I mean, everybody has to pass the tests. And the tests are their to ensure a safe, stable environment for everyone. Right. Benjamin Givens, did he pass all these stringent tests? I beg your pardon? Benjamin Givens, the son of Senator Charles Givens. I believe he applied for acceptance into St. Michael's a short time ago, unless I'm mistaken. Yes, that's correct. And according to you, it takes two months of these strict tests before you can get into St. Michael's. Right? But what I've gathered is Senator Givens called two days... not two months... But two days before his tour, is that right? Yes, that's right. So then it's possible that you sacrificed at least part of the screening process for certain boys. Let's say boys whose families donated money to, uh, let's say... Mr. Fletcher. I'm not trying to be a hard-on here, Fathers, honestly. But I think we've established that some boys don't have to go through these tests, right? Father, do you know anybody who was angry at Bennett, maybe holding a grudge? The only thing I could think of is... It's absolutely ridiculous, but... Why don't you... Detective. What? Found a witness. When I drove up last night at about 10:45 or so, near the side of the back steps, I saw a priest run across the road. What? You saw a priest? [Mallory] How'd you know it was a priest, Mr. Rios? Here at this place, there are only two kinds of people: priests or boys. It was a priest. He was wearing his habit. I had to slam on my brakes or I would've hit him. Would you recognize him again if you saw him? No. It was dark, so I couldn't make out his face. When I looked over at the steps, I didn't see anything else. Then I just drove away. That's it? Thank you very much. You can go. This way, Mr. Rios. A priest? [scoffs] I refuse to believe it. The man is obviously mistaken. The last time the victim was seen was on his way to confession. Father, who was in confession last night? Tuesday. Father Michael Kelly. Kelly? Listen, we might have to use your room for a little bit longer. Is that okay? Ah. Thanks. Let's go find Kelly. [Fletcher] Father Abbott. Father Kelly? Mm-hmm. Good to meet you. Please sit down. This isn't gonna take long. It's just a few questions. Of course. Okay, um, you're the 11th grade theology and ethics teacher here, right? That's right. Some say that you, uh, you get to know the boys pretty well, right? Yes, I do. I see them in the classroom and in the confessional. The confessional. Right, yeah, yeah. I'm not sure I'll be any help to you here. Just a little bit more time. Um... Where were you last night at 10:30? In the confessional. Is that a usual place to be so late? Yes, it is. Tuesdays, 7:00 till 10:30 p.m. David Bennett come to confession last night? Yes, he did. What time was he there? He was there till 10:30. So, um, obviously he was the last student, right? That's right, he was. So after he left, you locked the church and went right back to your room. Yes, I did. [Fletcher] I'm sorry. I got a little discrepancy here. I can't place you in your room until 10:45. That's when Father Augustus says he saw you come in. This morning I walked from the confessional to your room, and it was under three minutes. So how... Can you explain that? No. Uh... Yes. Um... No, I didn't leave right away. I stayed and did some things. You just said you locked up after Bennett left, right? I was mistaken. I'm sorry. Could you tell me what you were doing between 10:30 and 11:00? Simple question. I can't say. What does that mean? It means... I can't say. Can you tell me what you discussed with David Bennett? I can't tell you that, sir. Father, do you know... do you know how that young boy died? I'm sorry. "I'm sorry"? What are you sorry about? No, I'm not sorry. I just didn't hear you right. Father Kelly, we need to know where you were at the time of the murder. [chuckles] Sorry. You don't seem very surprised to hear that he was murdered. Rumors travels fast in small communities. Yeah. Have you heard this rumor, that he was murdered by a priest? That's impossible. Is it? Father Kelly, I feel like my time's being wasted here. Every priest can tell me exactly where they were at the time of the murder, and you can't. You won't talk to me. You won't say anything. What do you want me to think? What do you think, Detective? What do I think? I think I got a guy in front of me who won't answer any of my questions. And what that makes me think is, is that he is guilty as sin. All right, look. Give me something, all right? Anything. Make something up. Please. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. Thanks a lot for coming in. Father Kelly, be reasonable. [Fletcher] Hey, Kelly. I got one last question for you. Anybody in there in the church other than Bennett to verify you were there? No? Night, Father. Take this, put it on the lectern. Yes, Father. Father, I saw you talking to those men. What did you tell them? You didn't tell them about me, did you? I can't talk to you about this right now, Luther. You... You did. You told them about me. Father, is there anything else you need? [speaking Latin] Father, uh, I need to get to class. Yes, so do I. [boy] Michael. Hell. That stupid boy. Shut up, Frank. Where are you guys going? Shut up. You'll wake up Pa. Can I come? No. Please? No, Tim. It's not for kids. Come on. Let me go. [thunder rumbles] [thunderclap] [gasps] Did you hear what happened? Kind of. There was an accident at your school. I don't know. The nuns aren't really talking about it, but what happened? A kid was killed. He was murdered, actually. What? He was the kid who told Father Thomas about what I was doing. Oh, wow. I think they have a suspect. Really? Who is it? Father Kelly, our ethics teacher. Father Kelly? He led my confirmation last month. It's, like, I talked to him that entire Sunday. He's the nicest guy. He's so sweet. Yeah, well, he did it. I don't think he would do that... He did it. Not everybody's what they seem. 'Kay. I'm sorry. I'm just... I've been a little... Things have been, uh... I need you. You know that. You are so beautiful. Mm... No. Luther, no. Just... stop. That's fine. You don't have to leave. Could you just wait? I should go. I got stuff to do, and Mother Superior will be coming by anyway. Luther, please. I'm worried about you. Why? It's just rain. [window closes] I'm sorry. Please continue. I'm sorry. This is kind of new for me. He's the first person I've known our age that has passed away, so... No, he wasn't my friend. David was a bit of a loner. In geometry, I sat here. He sat here. In history, I sat here. He sat there. He had a thing for the front row. He was just one of those guys that piss off the teacher and get the kids more homework. I... I didn't know him well, but he's dead, so... whatever. I guess he was cool. I'm sorry that he's gone 'cause now I'll look at that front row... Actually, I could probably take the seat. I'm sorry. I didn't know him. You went to school with him. You didn't know him at all? Mm-mm. He was in one of my classes, but I never knew him... ever. Here, he lived sort of a double existence. On one hand, he would go to church and he'd pray. And on the other, he was famous for annoying the teachers and making all the other students mad. The teachers didn't like him. Some of the teachers really didn't like him. Especially Father Kelly, our ethics teacher. Father Kelly? Yeah. Yeah. Some days it looked like he was gonna rip his head off. I did not mean to make it look like... David was a very religious person. He was my roommate for two years, and he never really got on my nerves. He just didn't get stuff, you know? Like school stuff. He'd ask the same question a thousand times, and the teachers would think he was making fun or playing around. But he tried. He just... I don't know. So you must've known Bennett pretty well then, right? Um, no, not really. I mean, I do remember taking him and his family around the day of the final entrance exam, but... He was a nice kid. He really was. Not the greatest kid in the world, but, uh... I mean, other than seeing him in ethics class, I didn't really know him. Sorry. I gotta get to a test. Go, go, get out of here. Best of luck. Thanks for your time. Okay, that's it. I'm done. I'm going to take Kelly in. What? Hang on a minute. So Father Kelly killed Bennett because he was annoying? I didn't say that. The Catholic Church hasn't had the greatest P.R. lately, but still, it's hard for people to believe that a priest is gonna kill for no reason, and that's what we have, is no reason. Robin, trust me. You've been brainwashed up here, okay? They're all from hell. Trust me. I went to a school like this. I know what they're like. That's what this is about? Your school days? No. I just hate priests. Hey, Father. [priest] I always thought he was a nice guy. Very mysterious, though. We talked every once in a while. What do you mean by "mysterious"? I asked him about his family once, and he said he didn't have one. But he has a picture of a young boy in his room. [Mallory] Did you ever ask him about it? Yes. He said nothing, and I left it at that. Like I said, mysterious. I know that Father Kelly is a nice person. A good man. [Fletcher] You mean on the exterior. Well, I-I can't read souls, but I do think Father Kelly is linked with God in a very special way. We had our difficulties. And what do you mean, Father? I never liked Michael. Just something about him. You certainly looked very bad in front of Mr. Fletcher the other day. What were you thinking, Michael? Huh? I've known you for 17 years. And since the day you first came to the abbey, you didn't say two words more than you had to. You've always been quiet and independent, and that's fine at certain times, but right now is not one of those times. I'm scared. It's... It's a very different kind of fear. Well, what is it? Please, tell me. I can't. I can't. Michael, what are you so protective about? If you've done something wrong, I'm sure we can work it out. But help everyone here. Think of the school, Michael. Think of the abbey. I am. I am. Fletcher has called me in for a meeting this evening. He wants me to bring your files. I have to tell him about Tim. I have to tell him, Michael. I won't lie for you. Father, Fletcher is out to get me. If you tell him, he will have me crucified. I'm sorry. [Tim] Michael, tell him to let me do something. Let him do something, Frank. No. Michael! I'm going down to the lake. Come on, Frank. All right, butt-head. You wanna help? Grab the rope. Come on. [police radio chatter] Let's begin. Life must go on, gentlemen. You gotta respect that. Continue to work. Father? Derek. All the other teachers in our other classes said something about David. You act as if he's just absent. It's really out of the ordinary that he's not here. I mean, I agree with you that life must go on, but... it takes awhile. Yes. Well, we were at the bottom of page 73. Mr. Lee, since you're so eager to voice your opinion, why don't you read the section on Platonic dialect and tell us how it differs with the practices of today. "Critias, an uncle of Plato, was one of the group called the 30 Tyrants." Hey, Marie, did you get those reports I asked you for? They're on your desk. Thanks. And there's a man wearing a dress in your office. [Fletcher] Father Abbott. Ah. Thank you so much for coming. Mr. Fletcher. I brought you the information you asked for. Thank you. I appreciate it. Before you get to it, I think there's something you should know about Father Kelly. Well, what's that, Father? Well, Father Kelly was... involved in an accident before he came here. What kind of accident? Now, I know that sounds bad, but he's an honest man and a good man, and I just can't believe that he could be capable of killing that boy. His brother. [Mallory] I don't like your reasoning behind using this. I don't like the file. So I shouldn't use this, right? We have to use it. You're goddamned right I'm gonna use it. So he kills his brother and then becomes a priest? Whatever he becomes. I mean, granted, it's 30 years old, all right? But my bottom dollar, okay? He did it. How you doing, Father Kelly? Mr. Fletcher, I should let you know that I have nothing else to add to your investigation. I am sorry. Ah, that's okay. I don't wanna talk about the investigation. But I'd like to talk about the death of your brother, if that's okay. I'd rather not. Come on. Humor me a little bit here. What happened out there in the woods? You've read the report. You should know. Yeah, but this report... People wrote that. They weren't there. You were there. You saw it all. That's why I wanna hear it from you. I didn't do it. You didn't do what? Kill him. Bennett or your brother? Neither. I know. Your brother's death was accidental. Says it right there. But if it wasn't, then what? I'm sorry. I didn't know that I was being accused. Theoretically. It's a game. I mean, if it wasn't, then you'd be in a lot of trouble. I will not be bullied into a confession by you, Detective. You know nothing about me or my brother. Look, it's just that Bennett has a massive head wound, and I saw it, and it was a very messy thing, and you saw your brother had a massive head wound. I didn't kill them. You gotta admit it's a little coincidental. What are the odds? I'm just asking, what are the odds? So you are accusing me. I was thinking you're there, there's your brother, his brains all over a rock, right? How dare you! I did not murder my brother! I did not murder David Bennett! [Abbott] All right, everyone calm down. Come on, Tim. Give me the rope. I can't. Tim, just come out a little further. Come on. I-I'm gonna fall. You're not gonna fall. Come on. My butt's starting to hurt. Just give me the rope. Good job, stupid. I'm gonna fall. I wanna get down. You're not gonna fall. See? Frank! Frank, stop! You're not gonna fall. Frank, stop it! Frank, stop it, please! Frank! Quit being such a baby, Tim. Frank! What happened? Come on, Tim. [grunts] Come on, Tim. We're gonna go home. All right, Tim? We're gonna go home. Wake up, Tim! No. No! [grunting] [screams] What did you do? [sobbing] [Luther] I've done a lot of reading, thinking about the past couple days. And I realize I can't get mad at God for what happens. We all make choices. That's what life is: a collection of choices we've made. But they're of this world. We make believe that what we do on this earth really matters when we die, but it doesn't. You don't think it does? No. I mean, that's the trick they've pulled. I mean, they fool you into loving God. Everything's about fear. Fear of God, fear of ourselves. I'm not scared anymore. You know what, hey, I didn't really expect to see you again. It wouldn't have worked out between us. Then why do you keep coming back here? Guess I still like to see your face. Jesus... [drops keys] Jesus! I'm... I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher. What are you doing? I didn't mean to startle you. My apologies. This just won't wait till the morning. Now, I know how anxious you are to apprehend Father Kelly. And you think Father Kelly's innocent, right? It's not a matter of what I think. It's a matter of principle. Father, what do you want? You remember the first day that we met, and you asked me if there were any grudges that someone might have against Bennett or any reason that someone might have to harm him. Do you remember that? Of course I remember, very clearly. I think you might've overlooked someone. Who, Father? Who? Another priest? No, this young man is a student. Luther, get up, please. What? I need you to get dressed now and come with me. What time is it? Now, Luther! [door closes] Come, Luther, come. Have a seat. It's okay. How you doin', kid? How you doing? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Just wanna ask you a few questions. It's quiet, you know. Better time to talk. It's late. 10:30. Should be up doing your homework, laundry, calling a girlfriend. How come you didn't tell me you were getting expelled, you and your roommate? I get kids what they can't have, which, in this place, is everything. [sighs] My guess is you're not here to give me a detention slip, so why don't you just tell me what's going on? Hey! Don't get smart with me. I'm tired. What do you want? Why didn't you tell me Bennett was responsible for you getting kicked out? I was scared. Kid who narc's on me is dead. I already have a bad rep in my hometown, so... Hey, look, if anything, I owe Bennett. I hate this place. Right. I can understand that. But you should've told me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher, but... You're gonna tell me that I killed some kid because he got me kicked out of school, out of a school I hate? Let me tell you something. Out there... people kill for a lot less than that. Just please don't make out to be the bad guy here. Please? I'm not. My fath... I'm not making you out to be a bad guy. Relax. I didn't do this. Then... I was in my room when it happened. Father Thomas has us going to bed early. I know, all right? I know where you were. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about everything earlier. I'm just... Come on, kid. I-I'm scared. Relax. I'm not your enemy. I shouldn't even have called you. All right, get out of here. I'm sorry. Get out of here, all right? Come on. Don't worry. He got it all on tape. Turn off the light. Gotta conserve electricity. [knocking] Come in. Ah. Evenin', Michael. Father Abbott. This was at your doorstep. What is it? I don't know. Maybe the sisters were late again with the laundry. Would you like to come in? Well, just for a second. Have a seat. I don't want to take up too much of your time. Listen, Michael, if I were to ask you something, would you give me an honest answer? I can't do this with you now, Father. Michael, I'm beginning to have my doubts. Now, I'm not positive that you killed David Bennett, but I am positive that you're hiding something from me, and I'm trying to believe in you. I know you can't trust in me anymore. Why would you? Hmm. At first, I thought this was just an unfortunate accident. And then I thought maybe you were being set up. But now... I'm not even sure I can tell myself that anymore. [Robbie] I can't believe how far this thing has gone. How can you pretend this isn't happening? 'Cause I don't let it get to me. I've known you my whole life, man. You've been an awesome friend, but since that night, I don't know. What are you hanging around me for then? What am I supposed to do? Can't exactly go and hang out with those other guys down there and pretend that nothing's wrong. There's something very wrong with what we did. Something very wrong with you. Hey, don't lecture me, all right? You have no idea what goes on in my head. Feeling sorry for yourself, pushing your problems onto me. At least I keep my mouth shut. It's not just your problem, Luther. It's our problem, and there's nothing wrong with wanting to discuss that problem. I just wish I could discuss it with someone other than you. What's that supposed to mean? Don't worry about it, man. I won't push my problems onto you. Hey, look, look, look. We can talk about the problem, okay? I... I can't have you telling anybody. Luther, I killed someone. I know I wasn't the one who did it, but I was involved. And we're not getting blamed for it. Father Kelly's been questioned twice. The police are asking everyone about him. He's getting framed by us. I know it's not intentional, but it's still happening. You know what? You were right. He's not gonna say anything. First, I had hoped that he wouldn't. But now I kind of want him to. You don't know what you're talking about. I don't want him to get busted for this. Hey. We can still tell them that it was an accident. They'll believe us. I swear. It's the truth. You and I made a promise! A promise! Do you not understand that? Please. Please don't break this promise. I don't know what I'll do. You need help, Luther. Just... Please! It's them! It's not me! [sighs] Thank you for attending the St. Joseph's Day mass. We will continue our procession outside the church. [light chatter] [distant sirens blaring] [sirens approaching] [sirens wailing] Father Michael Kelly, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you by the court. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? This way, Father. [police radio chatter] Remember our promise. Screw your promise. Screw you, Luther. You wanna hurt me? Go ahead. You're gonna have to. I'm not dying with this on my soul. Don't do this! Don't do this to him! You've got it all wrong! Look, it's a mistake! Stay back! It's not him! Let... Let me through. Stay back. Officer, Officer, you gotta help me. What? My friend's hurt. He fell down the stairs. Who? Let me get some help. There's no time! There's your physical evidence. Anything you're not sure about now? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Fletcher? You come barging in here with your men and your guns, you disrupt the students... Father, I have a warrant. I'm really very sorry. Are you? Are you truly sorry? Or is it that you want Father Kelly so badly that you gotta make a show of it while you do it? Father, I'm truly sorry. [Robbie] Hey, you got the wrong guy! Come on! Just let me through! [Cop] Stay back, son! Get back! Let me talk to the officer! I can prove he's innocent! Stay back. Listen to me! Listen to me! He's innocent! I can prove it! I swear! Listen to me! You've got the wrong guy! Look, I know who the killer is. It's... [screaming] Nobody fire! Why did you do it? Why didn't you keep your mouth shut? Luther! He wasn't gonna say anything. He wasn't gonna say anything. Luther, look at me! We made a promise. We made a promise! Luther, damn it! Put the gun down! I didn't want to hurt you. I swear. I swear I didn't want to hurt you, Robbie. Luther! I confess. I confess. [screaming] [Fletcher] Hold your fire! Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot! Surround the building. I don't want anybody in there. Folks, you're gonna have to step back. Please clear the area. [police radio chatter] Hi, Father. Oh, go away. You know I'll kill you, too. You said you didn't want to hurt anyone else. I believe you. I'm gonna die anyway. Why not take a few along with me? Because you're not like that. Stop this. How can I stop this? I've sinned, and I'm not sorry. You have a choice, Luther. Choose to stop. Luther, you're not this type of person. I know that. You don't know me. Every day I try to know me, and I hate what I see. I can't escape myself. You're right. You can't escape yourself, but you can change. Redemption. I'll tell you what. I'll take you out of here. I will not let them take you away without a confession. Okay? We leave, you give yourself up, and then you confess. Then they take you. [gun cocks] Oh, God, what have I done? Luther, Luther, stop, stop, stop. If you do this, you die with this sin. Who cares? I'll spend the rest of my life in a goddamn cell! Fifth Commandment: Thou shalt not kill. Who do you want to punish, boy? God? Your parents? Yourself? No! What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? How do you want to live? To punish? Or to forgive? [sobbing] Choose. Choose. I'll go. I'll do it. [no audible dialogue] [praying in Latin] Oh, my God. Get a medic! [praying in Latin] Mercy exalts itself over judgment. God awaits the sinner. Luther, say it. God awaits the sinner. You say it. God awaits for the sinner. Pray for me, Father. [no audible dialogue] ♪♪
