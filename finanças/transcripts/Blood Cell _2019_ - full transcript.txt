Ouch! Shit Are you leaving us already? I didn’t get to annoy you yet What? You’re going have to rip your sheet into a make-shift cord if you’re wanting to swing off the bars tonight, but I hope you won’t since you’ve only just got here… another suicide and the guards won’t believe me Hope not And if you want to see the sunset, you’re going to have to move slightly to the left Funny thing is, I never remember watching them when I was free women Guess you don’t realise what you've got till it’s gone Amen to that Hey, wait! What? Yeah you look good in that light given the surroundings, I'll take that as a complement I’m Barbara by the way, and you are? What, you want to know my name? you know it’s been so long I’ve almost forgotten myself I’m just messing with you! I’m Evelyn And this is our living coffin Say goodbye to your dreams and hold onto your imagination What do you imagine? Naughty things… when the lights go out Again I’m just messing with you! Don’t worry were going to have plenty of time to size each other up over the next few days to… well forever, I suppose You’re a lifer as well? Unless the nutters in D declare an uprising perhaps you and I can escape in the confusion D wing... is it dangerous? Can be But to be honest I’m quite comfortable in here now, I don’t think I could even adjust to the outside world again Fair play So what was the last thing you saw on the news before you came in here? Me, strangely I’ve never been on TV before… and war and heartache across the world So same shit different day Well that settles it. I will stay in here, thank you very much Suppose it’s as safe as any If the mask scares you, then, tough I have to wear it to protect my skin What happened? I’ll tell you another time, but it fucking hurts You should watch out for the gangs in here So it's as bad as they make out on the TV? Can be but in here, it’s unedited But if you want to join one I’m sure you can find one Are you part of one? No, no - Tell you I’ve got nothing but time, but I haven’t got time for that Well you're part of one gang at least Yes, well... guilty Are you one of those ... addicted to it? Addicted to religion? No but, guess you could say I'm, I'm addicted to sin the book helps keep me balanced Don’t worry about that, always happens in S wing I thought this was E? S... shit Yeah were in the old part of town, unfortunately Don’t worry! you won’t decay yet, you’re not an old building I feel like I’ve been demolished Wait till you start feeling like a vagrant Yeah you’re going to start to rot in here soon enough Is that how you feel? I have my ways of coping So just so I know then, what... are you? Are you a wife? Girlfriend? Mother? All three in a past life, now guess I’m just a no good killer Well you must have killed good to wind up in here? He deserved it Just think of this place as the medicine for the crime Medicine? God I’m so ashamed Well, big guy knows you are What about you? What where you before all this? Well, on the outside I guess you could say I was a bit of a naughty girl and now I’m on the inside you could call me a... struggling artist Well I guess you... artists give ‘life’ - You're really going the extra mile I suppose I am I’m going to rest up anyway, I’m on these serious painkillers and they give me the harshest headaches do you need another? Do you have paracetamol? Actually yeah, on the shelf Damn it, they always make these things so tight! Shit! I’ll get 'em You ok? Yeah... blood just rushed to my head What’s this? What’s this you’re stashing away? Well that is private Is it like a happiness box? I used to have one of these as a teenager Don’t spill… Is it yours? No, no, no, no you can keep that, it’ll earn you some interest by the time you get out of here I wish Everything ok? Yeah, it's just going to take a while to adjust Do you want a tablet? I’m good thanks Do you need some water? No, All good By the way, um… I hope that you don’t mind, I, had a bit of water from the tap The tap wasn't working God it’s not water I just had a bit of wat… It’s not water... You need to get the guard, it's white spirit! What? Of course its water! My gosh, you fucking scared me. I was going to say, it’s not like you can see any paintings up here there will be Yeah? Is there art classes? Could say that but yeah, you're right the sink it's knackered I’m sure it’s on DIY Johnny the caretaker's list of thing to do, but he never comes around, so... I just fill the bottle up before lights go out But now that you’re here I suppose we’ll need two What's up? Shirts just a bit itchy Yeah, the new shirts, they're always like that Do you want of one my shirts? No – I’m ok, thank you I need to get used to it What is it? It’s just a mirror, is it yours? No, it’s not mine Must be an old cell mate's Yeah, guess what use would you need for a mirror in here? Fuck, Evelyn. I didn’t mean anything by that with, with the mask… It’s cool, don’t worry I know what you mean But in time you’re going to forget vanity in this place Don’t think I’ll need a few days Say Evelyn, you’re an... an artist, right? Yeah What do you think about doing something, doing something with this place? like decorating it? I’m not a damn decorator, Barbara This isn’t university halls, look around you, for God’s sake! Sorry, yeah It’s fine, Barbara. Just think, ok? Just be natural Let it out I’m sorry, it’s… Don’t poison yourself to be polite, What will you do? Wait until break time in the morning? No! My last cellmate was a right dirty bugger, So don’t worry I’ve heard all the tunes The bowels can make Rich or Poor, in this place we really do shit in the same hole Fucking animals in the zoo have more dignity That’s Nanna Gloria She likes to have a midnight howl at the moon Been in here since '84 As in she’s 84? Or since 84? Will she be ok? She has her moments, Because of her age She gets a little confused They were supposed to move her to a more ‘gentle’ environment, but budget cuts came first Poor soul I bet she’s been in here so long, she's forgotten her crime You should get comfortable with your emotions Barbara In forty years from now, Will anyone show concern for your health? I hadn’t thought that far ahead Anyway Gloria killed two men back in her prime, So nothing to feel sympathy for there No one young or old could wash that amount of blood Off their memories Where will they take her? The dungeon A place you do not want to go Solitary The fuck? What the fuck!? Don’t Evelyn, don’t say a fucking word! I was just going to say - There is blood on my fucking mattress, how is that safe? Don’t lie on the blood then! I’m sure they will get you a new one in the morning Listen, you need to make peace with all of this I’m sorry Edwidge? Edwidge is that you? Are you there? Yes, I can hear you There is no Edwidge here Are you ok? I heard crying You heard that? Yeah, are you ok? Yeah, it’s just midnight blues I’ve been here quite a while but it still gets to me It’s ok, it’s my first night I'm just adjusting to my surroundings Good luck Who is Edwidge? Someone I used to know Say tell me, I um, I heard a strange noise, like a machine No machines in here Ok... I’m sure I heard something coming from your room So what’s your name, newbie? Barbara Barbara behind bars, hey! Quite apt! Sadly Well I’m Camille, nice to meet you I’d shake your hand but the hole isn’t big enough In the morning then? So how long have you been in? Long enough How are you feeling? I’m good now thanks, just... Even after being in here for the duration I have, It can still get you down It’s amazing how brick walls can make you reflect On what you did in your past Telling me! I’m still curious to that noise I heard The noises in this place will sound like Sympathy of ghosts But, you’ll get used to it I’ve got no choice Speaking of which, Yeah? Who have you been talking to all night? I thought that cell was empty? Not anymore, now I’m here I’m surprised they didn’t put you in this cell With me I guess the guards have their reasons I know! Anyone would think I was a dangerous cell mate How do you survive this place? Jeez Well, don’t let it get to you just yet, First night and everything Forever is a long time, so get used to it Just give me a shout if you need me Will do Shit! Such a beautiful colour I can’t wait to grow old with you and make you my masterpiece You're lucky to be here with me The real killer in prison is loneliness Us together, we will be un-separable Don’t open it! Is it yours? I think it’s good No please, Barbara! Just give it back, ok? It's private I said Well don’t throw it It’s a drawing, it helps calm me down This medication I’m on, it drives me up the fucking wall but this, it... counter-balances it Is that it? No, it was the only subject at school I was really ever good at You know once my work, at the age of six my teacher put my work on display in the school entrance That was nice of her It was. However, the school bully got jealous, of course and defaced the painting I seem to think revenge was swift Yeah I caught up with him in the school playground, he got a shove to the floor, hand I threw his lunch box onto the school roof He got off light, then? And I may have painted his school bag a lovely shade of pink My art is a bit of a... love/hate relationship Can I look now? No I, I borrowed a few sheets to pass time You’re in for life, I don’t have that many sheets I'm sorry Do you know how difficult it was to get that fucking paper in here? I'll pay you back How are you going to do that? How? Gonna go down to the arts and crafts store tomorrow? Did you see that in the yard? I didn’t see the yard yet Well if you had, You'd know there isn’t fucking one! Barbara, I have to rely on the guards to bring me that stuff in, alright? unlike most cell mates, they want drugs, they want mobile phones But I just want some decent fucking paper, alright!? I've no family or friends doing good will for me I get it, ok. I’m sorry No - no I don’t think you do! that stuff... helps me escape. It’s the only luxury I have What did you draw, anyway? It’s good Did you take classes or something? Only what was offered at school So what do you like to draw the most? People? Buildings? Landscape? Why? Just, maybe in time, I could sit for you, if you want? Really? No nude stuff, though Why? Why? Because… Barbara, I’d really like that You promise, promise, promise, to sit for me? I promise Ok, and do you promise not to take my paper again? Yes for richer or poorer I promise never to take your fucking paper ...or your fish Fucking hell I wish they’d bring me some food What, you’re doing me now? Not quite… I'll capture you soon though, you won’t even see me working Given my first night, I don’t think I’m ready to be captured, any more than I already am. Can you work in this light? I’ll make it work Have you done other people? Inmates? Lines around the block It’s a shame What? Well on the... outside I had a friend of a friend who works with artists I doubt she will be visiting you now you swim in these circles I won’t be holding my breath But she could helped you get you a fan base though This art I do isn’t for a fan base, it’s more than that Eve, I’ll be your fan if you like? Really? Yeah, and... is that true what you said? About what? That no one visits you? Well, only the prison staff and well, there was Father Lenzi, he used to come around to bless us He used to come around That's nice Well, not since he was caught with his hand down one of the inmate’s knickers The dirty pervert Jeez, if it ain't tough enough around here we've got to worry about that! Here… Thank you You can take that It’s a bit warm, EVELYN: might have melted Lucy? How’d you get here? Hello Hello? Mum? Edwidge! Honey, are you ok? I’m ok mum Where are you now? They said you were in a place for sick people? Who is ‘they’ poppy? Just people Well don’t listen to them, I’m safe, ok? Ok mum When will you come home?

I think she is there with you Yeah, she was here Was? She doesn’t look well, does she? Not really, honey Now you can see how bad.... These so called 'friends'are in the orphanage They killed my pet Lucy Are you still there? Yeah Why would they do that? I don’t know mum, You tell me why people kill? Because sometimes people have to, to protect the ones they love It’s not enough mum, You killed dad What is happening? I had to But I could have kept a secret No, no And we’d still be a family No, no don’t think like that Do you hear me? Yes Yes God Mum, are you still there? Yeah, still here Who's there?

Anywhere There's a forest near the home No, no, no don’t go there! Go to the police station I think they won’t believe me, And only bring me back here You little shit, Edwidge What are you doing in here? I was... I was just... What were you doing with that phone? PUT IT DOWN! No don’t do it! Get to your room - GO NOW! - Don't do it, Edwidge! Goodnight Mum No! Hello? Hello, who is this? You keep your fucking hands off my flesh and blood! Who is this?

Yes, I fucking am Well, when you work out how to get out of your cell Give me a buzz You ok? Yeah, thank you Not having a good time, I’m guessing? Not exactly God, it’s harder than I thought in here Don’t let ‘Costa da shit hole’ get to you You're better than those four walls True It reminds me of my student digs Jeez What did you study, and where? Just... business management and stuff Suppose I put my education to good use to end up in here You weren't to know how things would end up Yeah What did you do, before this? Just the basics, nothing fancy I always thought my Edwidge would end up doing something arty in time Who's Edwidge? Just my daughter Hopefully your daughter will Yeah She was always painting and colouring everything in as a little one I’m sure she'll pursue it if she enjoys that much God I hope… she can forgive me when she’s old enough She will, I'm sure of it Yeah Do you have a pen in there? Why? Doesn’t matter, one second What's this for? Take a look at those four miserable walls around you Can’t miss them Ok So a while back you did something that put you in here That fleeting moment of killing your husband Doesn’t define who you are in here You're better than this brick and mortar Thanks Ok, so go and own the wall What do you mean? Just mark it, write on it, a quote, Even a smiley face Am I allowed to do that? Wow! You’ve taken a life And now you’re worrying about graffiti Yeah Just write something Amalgamate your mind with the cell Finished? Yeah Finished What did you put? I'll show you tomorrow Wow, a gala opening of a new artist Hardly I think my daughter is better than me You sound a little happier? Yeah Yeah, I think I am Thanks Camille You have to make this place work for you This place is all about manipulation The guards, the wardens don’t care As long as they are getting paid And they are We all did something wrong to be put in here, But those fleeting moments shouldn’t define us For the rest of our days Thanks again Say, What do you prefer the most - European or America? I don’t know. European, I guess Why? One second… Ok I thought it was a joint Why would you like one? No, thanks I... don’t want to tarnish my first nighton a bad habit You're so posh Maybe in a past life Did you see the picture? Merci Hopefully it will give you someplace to escape to Yeah Until I escape from this shithole Nice picture Where did you get that thing? From a friend Is it... Paris, or Blackpool tower? It’s the Eiffel Tower, Paris Have you been? Nah, but I did score some good crack in Blackpool What I’d do to score some bloody food Perhaps they will bring you the mystery meat I won't ask! So, where else have you been,Ms. Paris? quite a few places Australia, New York, most of Europe, Iceland Did your daughter travel with you? Not as such, it would have made a nice memory now If my calculations are correct, she was actually conceived in New York So, maybe she will travel in time So she’s a born city girl then! So what about you? What did you do to end up in here? Guess you could say I was a bit of a... bit of a con artist Ripped off a fair few folk You know... Gallery owners, art collectors Plus, there was this one time I got really pissed off with a gallery owner I snuck into his show Get this, with white spirit in a perfume bottle! A few sprits here and there It can really devalue the price of piece of art Stop banging! Stop banging You don’t want to end up in solitary on your first night, do you? Listen, Barbara I like you Not like that I’m not out to fuck you I’ve seen other cell mates go through what you going through Maybe I can help I can have a word with one of the guards she can sort you out You know, get you things to make you feel more settled Drugs? No Yeah if you want drugs, but no what I’m saying is... Maybe she can track down your daughter She’s good at that type of thing And yeah, if you need some contraband in meantime I’m sure she can add you to the shopping list Can she bring a key for the door? She isn't a miracle worker But, if she can’t find someone then they haven’t been born yet! Listen, I’m... going to rest up for a while Just don’t... Just don’t do anything mental in the meantime, ok? Read the book, if you’re not tired Thanks Camille I thought you might like a picture With a sense of freedom I do I do have one of the Golden Gate Bridge In San Francisco However you can see Alcatraz in the background But also this being your first night and all, I like the Grand Canyon! Why's that? Just a place of wonder… I’d like to think it’s where Some start of life on Earth began Please I've got Evelyn giving me RE. lessons and now the scientist trying to tell me we fell from space What do you mean? That cell I thought was cleaned out, And you say there’s a Bible? I don’t think the Gideon’s visit here Yeah, my cell mate Evelyn gave it to me Are you still there? Yes, honey Are you sure someone is there with you? As sure as I'm talking to you It’s just… Evelyn killed herself a while back Don't fuck with me, that's not funny I'm not She's sitting here right now No, she can't be She killed herself, I think she had a dose of the... 'Cabin fever' and couldn’t handle this environment How did she do it? You don't want to know She couldn’t have, she’s been banging on about religion isn’t suicide the greatest sin? Maybe not everyone can use the strength God gives them to not give into their demons… Either way, It would seem most who end up in your cell, Give up eventually Thanks for the heads up She wore... She wore a mask, why? How can you know that? Because I'm looking at her right now! She entered the prison wearing it I don’t know what or why she had it No Let me go Camille let me go You can’t stop what has already happened Barbara No I can save her! I heard the souls of those who take their own lives Return to where they died to repeat their death For eternity Such a cruel fate I wouldn’t cry for her too much, She killed a kid What? What? She told me she was a con artist? God, what is going on in there? I don't know Yeah, She did some dodgy dealings in the art world, That much is true The story is she went to the home Of these gallery owners, Broke in and killed his five year old son How could someone do that to a child? When the police turned up all she could say was... ‘For the blood’ Wow we really are a messed up bunch of ladies It’s too much You who killed to protect, Evelyn killed for goodness knows what reason! Good luck with the ghost Everything ok, Barbara? Yeah, just adjusting is all I see you read some of the book? Yeah, I read a couple of passages That's good What did you think? Bit too heavy If I could ask you though, to put it back In the right position, standing up not on its side Sorry I will When are you going to? To? Put the book back in it's position? Yeah ok, sure Actually, I think I'll read a little Mum, why can’t I stay up late to watch the movie? Because those movies are too old for you And besides, You have school in the morning Please? I did my homework early so I could watch it I know, but honey you don’t need to watch those movies You're too young Well it’s stupid, Making movies that can’t be watched It’s not stupid What isn't stupid? Sorry, I was thinking out loud Ok, but there isn’t anything stupid about what you’re reading I guess Mummy, I'm scared! Can you run? Where to? Anywhere There's a forest near the home No, no, no don’t go there! Go to the police station I think they won’t believe me, And only bring me back here Edwidge Edwidge I’m coming for you, Edwidge! What the hell is this? I need to call my daughter! No one is calling anyone Where is it? Where the fuck has it gone!? Where is what? The phone! This is getting ridiculous Open!

Anyone! GUARDS! Well it’s a bit early, but... let the art begin GUARDS! GUARDS! GUARDS! Anyone!? They will give me extra shit now because of this Why do I always get the crazy ones? Ouch!

Yes, of course! Anything for you Yes, that’s lovely I can’t wait to meet tomorrow my friend from the wall What is going on? Yes, yes! You’re awake now What is going on? I hope you can understand how those conversations through the wall have been driving me to the high Heavens all night I was talking with Camille She seems a nicer cell mate than you God, you’re even crazier than I thought! Camille is already dead What? But don’t worry! We'll play along with this In fact, you two wimps would be perfect together What the fuck is going on, Evelyn? I’m about to draw the dying You’re going to be the perfect subject I had a good feeling about you as soon as you arrived Seriously Evelyn, you need to let me loose Barbara, I'm not out to kill you Yes I can smell the death escaping It's beautiful I’m sorry Barbara, Did I over step our boundaries? Fuck you Hey, maybe we need a safe word Yeah, like the perverts have Safe word How about ‘eat shit you faceless whore’ You’re a funny one You gonna tell me what's going on? What you expect me to fill that one as well? If you don’t mind You were a mother once Barbara, you must know this one This little piggy went to market This little piggy stayed at home Yes he did This little piggy had roast beef and this little piggy had... NONE Barbara, is everything ok? Wow Things have really got fucked up in this Prison tonight Haven’t they? Camille, help me! NO! What? NO! - What is happening? - Do you need a guard? No No, I'm fine Are you ok? You sound... Yes, yes, I'm fine. I was just, having a cry is all Well as long as you’re alright Say, Camille Do you have anymore of those... lovely postcards? You’ve had quite a few already though Barbara Please? Sure, ok Do you have any of Japan? how I miss that place That’s nice place, I never went It's a most beautiful place, You're really missing out Barbara, it’s your little play mate Have you been to Japan? Fuck off You have it? just a little further I guess we should shake hands then, shouldn't we? Yes Guess we should Barbara, what are you doing? Barbara, what the hell is this?! It's not Barbara Evelyn! How? I should ask you the same question Did Heaven not want you? Or did Hell spit you back out? What is this? Camille, this is mine and Barbara’s place of art and creation You had your chance to be my muse, but you fucked it up I wouldn’t want to work with someone like you It'll only be a matter of time before you sell out I won't, and have never sold out You fucking bitch! Dear, Barbara, I need a bowl Quick! I got a bowl Damn it It wasn’t the right shade anyway Well, at least she won’t interrupt us anymore You went too fucking far Evelyn! Don’t be sad I’ve put her out of her misery Honestly she used to cry herself to sleep every night She was far too religious to take her own life Trust me... I’ve heard the attempts Barbara Would you look at that! Look at that crap photo It isn’t even Japan Barbara, what is the matter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost You make drawing look easy It isn't easy Barbara I wish I kept with my art classes Could have made a couple of extra quid on the side Then again, Being married to a rich prick like I was, we didn’t need the profits - unlike you I don’t do this for a profit, and I don’t need a sponsor Yeah, I can see that, you scatty bitch Why don’t you go beg for parole and find yourself a rich suitor? Really it’s the only way for a starving artist What do you think I am, Barbara? Some lackey, that in order to do my art, I’ve... got to open my legs every night? Take a look on the shelf What? The penny, I added it to your savings No! You just put that there because you think it’s your place No I knew you were good, so I put it there as a down payment on the drawing of me You know some say that - 'The eyes are the gateway to the soul' Not again, please I call bullshit on that That... That is the soul right there Do you know, Barbara, must confess, I... lied to you about what I did to get into this place You see, Yeah, I like to draw my subjects as they slowly... die Somehow their soul, it... lifts up and lands onto my canvas Fuck sake You ever heard of the Crimson Killer? No, what’s that? Some fucking pretentious art movement? I drew over fifteen people, before the police caught up with me I would never have branded myself with such a name Fucking media journalist pricks I’m going to draw such a beautiful image Yes, you’re going to so proud When you’re done with it, I’m going to wipe my fucking arse with it, even if you make me look like a Rembrandt Tell you something Barbara, if I couldn’t draw... Well, I’d go berserk Yes I would like to draw more more landscapes Then I could create a a quiet quaint countryside for me to escape to Yeah but after being in here as long as I have, your perception of reality goes out of the window Well Fuck the outside world, hey! I think your work title will be - ‘Sybaritic’ What the fuck does that mean? It’s the life you left behind Self-indulgent and luxurious So this is some kinky thrill for you? Oi! We’ve got work to do Relax I’ll fix you up afterwards It will be fine Don’t be so sour This drawing of you is quite good, if I don’t say so myself You are a beauty to draw You were right, this is a kinky thrill I mean us artists, we're all... perverts at heart, aren’t we? If this is just about touching me up let’s just do it and get it over with No This isn’t about pussy Well, I mean it could be Would you like that? No Barbara, stop it I am very professional with my subjects What’s stopping you? I'm shy Aren’t we all? Come on Start with a kiss, let me see the real you I think my scars will scare you Well, it’s yours for the taking I need some more blood first No, no Do it after Come on How could you? How could you?! You’re a spiteful women, Barbara You’re spiteful! I was making your drawing of you look beautiful Look at it, look at it! I was making you look beautiful I’m an artist I see you and this is how you thank me See me? See me? You fuck! You’ve been looking at me all night You didn’t have to do all this to FUCKING SEE ME Fuck you FUCK YOU! I think we should both go to bed, it’s been a long night for both of us No, no, no, no I’m just waiting for someone to come in, walk through the door give an interview on what it was to be drawn by a great artiste Really, Barbara? That’s real nice, that is! A word, if you wouldn’t mind? You’ve never spoken to anyone about your art, have you? Evelyn, You are brilliant There you go! Look, your first review I don’t need some snotty fucked up reviewer’s opinion! You shouldn’t joke about such things, it’s upsetting Come on Evelyn, don’t leave me like this Look I know art is supposed to make you feel something, but this is killing me You know what your problem is? You’re haunting yourself to keep yourself company You will never be ... dead enought to be a truly good ghost, Barbara Your pathetic Now good night Now I’m hungry for a midnight snack Look who I’ve got to introduce you to Look. Barbara! It's some of your lovely cell mates in here Yes, yes, yes This, Audrey Yes Audrey and Saffron, She was a rich bitch just like you Sally, Sally! She liked to take the piss And we also got you know Annie, and Anna, they're a bit shy Yes, we shouldn’t bother them too much But this the key to my heart You've had that the whole time? Barbara, you are silly Once you’ve been in here as long as I have, you get a little perk along the way and they know I’m not interested in escaping Come on Barbara, what would you do wi- You don’t know the layout of this place You probably wouldn’t even make it out the wing I’m going to go and get something to eat for a midnight snack There we are Bye Barbara Bye, bye, bye Don’t go escaping! FUCK! Thank God What? Well isn’t this a nice treat? I didn’t know you were so kinky How are you here? After everything that has happened to you already, and you’re questioning me? Kill me now you fucking coward I’d love for you to join me Well that’s my cue Scared of a women I should thank her It's ghosts galore in here It is...
