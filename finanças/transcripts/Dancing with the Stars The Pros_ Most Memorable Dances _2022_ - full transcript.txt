In 2005, an exciting dance competition burst onto the air and quickly dominated popular culture. Not only did it become the most-watched show in America, it changed the lives of all of us professional dancers. (people cheering) DEREK: Thirty spectacular seasons… (lively music playing) …351 sensational stars… It's the greatest night of my life. DEREK: Tearful drama… This experience has meant the world. DEREK: Electrifying stunts. That was super tight! Let's get it! Raise them up! DEREK: And a lifetime of unforgettable performances. Ten! Ten! Ten! But which are the most memorable? (lively music continues playing) DEREK: Tonight, the Top 20 for the people who know them best. This is what we live for. This is what the show is about. This is Dancing with the Stars: The Pros' Most Memorable Dances. (theme music playing) (people cheering) (drum rolling) ALAN: From Hollywood, here are your hosts: Welcome to Disney+ and our special inside-look at the most memorable dances from the first 30 seasons of Dancing with the Stars. We pulled our pros and asked them to pick from the thousands of performances we've had over the years. And tonight, we're going to pull back the curtain and reveal the pros' Top 20. And we'll give you our perspective on what made them so unforgettable. Some moments are so vivid, we remember exactly how we felt when we danced with our stars. We hope you'll agree that revisiting them now is just as exciting as seeing them live for the first time. There's something for everyone. From the champs who won your votes to choreography that won Emmys. So let's kick off our celebration with a Mirrorball-winning freestyle that touched the hearts of 30 million viewers on our most-watched finale ever. I'm so proud that this dance made the list. Coming in at Number 20, it's the Super Bowl champion Hall of Famer, my partner, the winner of season three, Emmitt Smith.

Okay, keep in mind that the title of the show is The Pros' Most Memorable Dances. And "most memorable" doesn't always mean best. Like when Michael Bolton danced out of a dog house, or when Tiger King star, Carole Baskin, did a toothless paso doble. Or when Master P earned the lowest score in Dancing with the Stars' history and incurred the wrath of Len. -P, hold my gaze. -Yeah. -(crowd booing) -LEN: It is time to go. SAMANTHA: Eight out of 30. Our head judge speaks truth. But there's one dance the pros will never forget for an obvious reason. At Number 19, it's Kim Kardashian and Mark Ballas twerking to "Baby Got Back". (people cheering) ("Baby Got Back" playing) ♪ I like big butts and I cannot lie ♪ ♪ You other brothers can't deny ♪ ♪ That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist ♪ ♪ And a round thing in your face You get sprung ♪ ♪ Want to pull up tough 'cause you noticed that butt was stuffed ♪ ♪ Deep in the jeans she's wearing I'm hooked and I can't stop staring ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha And take your picture ♪ ♪ My homeboys tried to warn me But that butt you got ♪ ♪ Makes me, me so horny ♪ ♪ Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin you say you want to get in my Benz? ♪ ♪ Well, use me, use me 'cause you ain't that average groupie ♪ ♪ I've seen her dancin' To hell with romancin' ♪ ♪ She's sweat, wet Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette ♪ ♪ I'm tired of magazines sayin' flat butts are the thing ♪ ♪ Take the average man and ask him that She gotta pack much back ♪ -♪ So, fellas, fellas ♪ -♪ Yeah, yeah? ♪ -♪ Has your girlfriend got the butt? ♪ -♪ Hell yeah ♪ -♪ Tell 'em to shake it, shake it ♪ -♪ Shake it, shake it ♪ ♪ Shake that healthy butt, baby got back ♪ ♪ Little in the middle but she got much back ♪ ♪ Little in the middle but she got much back ♪ ♪ Little in the middle but she got much back ♪ ♪ Little in the middle but she got much back ♪ (music ends) (people cheering) Ooh, that was good, Kym. That was a perfect fake. You're learning quick. Mm-hm, well, I'll tell you from experience who the really fast learners are. Football players. (chuckles) I've danced with a couple of them. Both made it to the finals, and Hines Ward took home the trophy. In 30 seasons, we've had 15 Super Bowl champions, and four Mirrorball winners from the NFL. Coming in at Number 18 is this winning paso doble from our 10th anniversary special, featuring seven of the best players in the game. -(glass crashing) -Oh! You were supposed to go out for that. (people cheering) TOM: Here they are. ("Heavy Action" playing) (people cheering, whistling) The power of that dance shows why football players have been so successful on our show. We pros are constantly reminding our stars of one important thing. Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. Yes, but we also remind them that making it to the finale is a huge accomplishment in itself. Yeah, that too. Okay, good. For every Mirrorball champion, there's a talented runner-up. Some of the stars who looked like early winners were Mario Lopez, Lindsey Stirling, Milo Manheim, Melby, and my partner from Season Eight, Gilles Marini, just to name a few. Zendaya from Season 16 is another. She may be an Emmy-winning actress and a massive movie star now but some say she also might be the best dancer not to win a Mirrorball. She pulled off all kinds of routines with ease but this performance best captures her spirit. (people cheering) ("Do I Do" playing) ♪ When I see you on the street ♪ ♪ My whole body gets weak ♪ ♪ When you're standing on the crowd ♪ ♪ Your love talks to me loud ♪ ♪ Girl, do I do ♪ ♪ What you do ♪ ♪ When I do ♪ My love to you? ♪ ♪ Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips ♪ ♪ Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you ♪ ♪ Oh, yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips ♪ ♪ Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you ♪ ♪ Do you want some candy? ♪ ♪ Do you want some honeysuckle? ♪ ♪ Do you want some chocolate dripping kisses of love for you? ♪ ♪ Whoo! ♪ (people cheering) (majestic music playing) -(music distorts, ends) -Uh, whoa, whoa. -Whoa. (laughs) -What? Let's leave the gymnastics to our Olympic athletes. -You don't want to see my tricks? -Oh, I know you got tricks. -Okay. All right. -Yeah. Over the past 17 years, we've seen jaw-dropping performances from Laurie Hernandez, Mary Lou Retton, and one of the greatest of all time, Simone Biles. Ooh! Now, of all the Olympians we've had on Dancing with the Stars, there's no legend bigger than Shawn Johnson. Not only did she take home the Season Eight Mirrorball with Mark Ballas, but she returned for our All-Star Season to dance with me. Well, and just came in second. -Ooh. -(laughs) So let's see one of her dances with Mark. Ah, that kind of… That's done a little bit… -Just a little… -(laughs) This Lindy Hop made Number 16 on the pros' list for its perfect combination of excellent technique, gravity-defying stunts and Mark's short shorts. (Kym hums) (people cheering) ♪ Ready, set, go, man, go ♪ ♪ I got a gal that I love so ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Going to the corner pick up my sweetie pie ♪ ♪ She's my rock 'n' roll baby she's the apple of my eye ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ All the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls ♪ ♪ Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball ♪ ♪ The joint's really jumping the cats are going wild ♪ ♪ The music really sends me I dig that crazy style ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ooh, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Aw! ♪ ("Ready Teddy" continues playing) ♪ Gonna kick off my shoes way up my faded jeans ♪ ♪ Gonna rock and roll to build the steam ♪ ♪ I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right ♪ ♪ Gonna rock and roll to the early, early night ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy ♪ ♪ I'm ready, ready, ready to rock 'n' roll ♪ (music ends) (people cheering) Amazing. Shawn came so close to becoming a two-time Mirrorball champion. Some stars will stop at nothing to make a big impression in the ballroom. They'll even resort to kissing up to the judges. This next one was an expert at working his charm. It's my partner from Season Four and 15, Joey Fatone. I just love him. He was so fun, up for anything and he kept me laughing every day. Your perfect score in jive from Season Four is a sparkling example of Joey at his most charismatic. Mm-hm, I am thrilled that the pros picked this dance for Number 15 on our list. (people cheering) ("Jump, Jive an' Wail" playing) ♪ Baby, baby it looks like it's gonna hail ♪ ♪ Baby, baby it looks like it's gonna hail ♪ ♪ You better come inside ♪ ♪ And let me teach you how to jive and wail ♪ ♪ Oh, you better jump, jive and then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive, then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive and then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive, then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive then you wail away ♪ ♪ Papa's in the icebox lookin' for a can of Ale ♪ ♪ Papa's in the icebox lookin' for a can of Ale ♪ ♪ Mama's in the backyard learning how to jive an' wail ♪ ♪ Oh, you gotta jump, jive then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive, then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive and then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive and then you wail ♪ ♪ You gotta jump, jive then you wail away ♪ (people cheering) What an entertainer. Moving across the floor is something that many of us take for granted. But for others represents a challenge to overcome with each and every step. Nothing could hold back our first ever Paralympian contestant, Amy Cody. Not even the loss of her legs. Her performance average is one of the highest ever in the history of the show. ALL: Ten! CHERYL: Amy raised the bar, defied expectations and moved all of us to tears. The truth is, I wasn't supposed to be on this particular season, but I came back when I found out that we'd be partners. Honestly, it was a privilege to dance with her. At Number 14 on our list. Here's the quickstep that the other pros and I will never forget. (people cheering) ("You Can't Hurry Love" playing) ♪ I need love, love, love to ease my mind ♪ ♪ I need to find, find someone to call mine ♪ ♪ But mama said you can't hurry love ♪ ♪ No, you just have to wait ♪ ♪ She said love don't come easy ♪ ♪ It's a game of give and take ♪ ♪ You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait ♪ ♪ You gotta trust, give it time ♪ -♪ No matter how long it takes ♪ -♪ Now, wait ♪ ♪ But how many heartaches must I stand ♪ ♪ Before I find a love to let me live again? ♪ ♪ Right now, the only thing that keeps me hanging on ♪ ♪ When I feel my strength yeah, it's almost gone ♪ ♪ I remember mama said ♪ -♪ You can't hurry love ♪ -♪ No, you just have to wait ♪ ♪ She said love don't come easy ♪ ♪ It's a game of give and take ♪ ♪ You can't hurry love ♪ ♪ No, you just have to wait ♪ ♪ She said trust, give it time ♪ -♪ No matter how long it takes ♪ -♪ Now, wait ♪ (people cheering) (mysterious music playing) Our Emmy-award-winning lighting designers deserve a lot of credit for helping us create not only the proper mood for our choreography, but for making us all look so good. And our makeup, hair and costume teams have transformed our stars into everything, from Disney villains, to storybook heroes, earning 35 Emmy nominations and taking home six awards. At Number 13 on our list is a stunning example of everything working together. It's a Swan Lake-inspired paso doble from Nev Schulman and Jenna Johnson. Based on this flawless execution of the routine, you would never have guessed he's the host of Catfish, and not performing at The Met. (people cheering) ("Swan Lake" playing) (people cheering) When it comes to our spectacular opening numbers, Dancing with the Stars has a reputation for pulling out all of the stops. We've been so fortunate to have been a part of things we could only have dreamed of, from shutting down Hollywood Boulevard to taking over Griffith Park. It's amazing to work together in an epic performance that's surprising, fun, and most of all, filled with magic moments. -Even Disney magic. -(all chuckle) In fact, we think the most impressive of all is the opening of Season 28 taped over two, very long nights at Disneyland. (chuckles) (people cheering) (fireworks whistling, exploding) ("When You Wish Upon A Star" playing) From The Disneyland Resort, it's Disney night on Dancing with the Stars! MICKEY: Oh, boy! (laughs) You wanna do the honors, Mickey? MICKEY: You bet, Tom! (clears throat) On with the show! ♪ It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪ ♪ Even though the sound of it Is really quite atrocious ♪ ♪ If you say it loud enough You'll always sound precocious ♪ ♪ Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪ ♪ Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I ♪ ♪ 'Cause I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad ♪ ♪ My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad ♪ ♪ But then one day, I learned a word that saved me aching nose ♪ ♪ The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes ♪ ♪ It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪ ♪ Even though the sound of it Is really quite atrocious ♪ ♪ If you say it loud enough You'll always sound precocious ♪ ♪ Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪ ♪ Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I ♪ ♪ Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I ♪ ("I Wanna Be Like you" playing) (clapping) (fireworks whistling, exploding) ♪ Now, I'm the king of the swingers oh, the jungle VIP ♪ ♪ I've reached the top and had to stop and that's what bothering me ♪ ♪ I wanna be a man, a mancub and stroll right into town ♪ ♪ And be just like the other men I'm tired of monkeying around ♪ ♪ Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you ♪ ♪ I wanna walk like you talk like you, too ♪ ♪ You'll see it's true ♪ ♪ An ape like me ♪ ♪ Can learn to be human, too ♪ ♪ Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you ♪ ♪ I wanna walk like you talk like you, too ♪ ♪ You'll see it's true ♪ ♪ An ape like me ♪ ♪ Can learn to be human, too ♪ ♪ Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you ♪ ♪ Wanna be like you ♪ ♪ I wanna talk like you walk like you, too ♪ -♪ You'll see it's true ♪ -♪ You'll see it's true ♪ -♪ Someone like me ♪ -♪ Someone like me ♪ ♪ Can learn to be like someone like you ♪ -(fireworks exploding) -(people cheering) (soft music playing) TOM: One of the most powerful aspects of dance is the ability to touch an audience without a single word. Seeing stars who have never danced before telling a story through movement can be life-changing. At Number 11 is one of our most inspiring performances. It's Season 22 champions Nyle DiMarco and Peta Murgatroyd's freestyle depicting Nyle's relationship with his deafness. (people cheering) ("The Sound Of Silence" playing) ♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪ ♪ I've come to talk with you again ♪ ♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪ ♪ Left its seeds while I was sleeping ♪ ♪ And the vision ♪ ♪ That was planted in my brain ♪ ♪ Still remains ♪ ♪ Within the sound of silence ♪ ♪ And in the naked light, I saw ♪ -♪ Ten thousand people, maybe more ♪ -(person whistling) ♪ People talking without speaking ♪ ♪ People hearing without listening ♪ ♪ And the sign said "The words on the prophets ♪ ♪ Are written on the subway walls ♪ ♪ In tenement halls" ♪ ♪ And whispered ♪ ♪ In the sound ♪ ♪ Of silence ♪ (people cheering) Each of these dances represents countless hours of rehearsal, training, inventing new choreography, pushing our stars and ourselves to the limit and beyond. But what really pushes us over the edge are the unpredictable moments. Here are just a few of the times when the unexpected got the best of us. You know, I just want to have fun and I'm hoping that… (wall crashing) Oh, my God! (grunts) -(grunts, groans) -Oh! Ow! -(grunts) -Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! I think I busted my lip bad. I think I broke my arm. Pfft. (screaming) -(squeals) -Don't squeal in every step, like, aah! -I can't help it, I get scared. -It's called "walking." -Four, cross, open. -Ma'am… (bleeps) I actually don't know if I can dance. I really don't know. I'm not getting it. I'm not getting it. We're not going to win if I can't get it. There's no beat there! There's nothing in the music. There's nothing! -Romantically, what's going on here? -Nothing. This is a problem. Oh, boy. Okay. -I'm done. I'm done today. Are we gonna ever do a, "Hey, let's just do a dance, drink a beer" dance? Probably not, no. We pros start each season by asking our stars for their complete trust. That's a tall order for people who are stepping outside of their comfort zones. However, the beauty of ballroom dancing is when the stars have enough faith in us pros, and decide to trust the process. That was the case when Kellie Pickler joined us in Season 16. She came in with absolutely no dance experience and transformed into an exquisite performer. In just one dance, it shows how far she came in just three months. Our finale freestyle is it. And here's a fun fact, we actually never got all the way through the routine, except for when it mattered most. Live on the air. (people cheering) ("Beneath Your Beautiful" playing) ♪ You tell all the boys no ♪ ♪ Makes you feel good, yeah ♪ ♪ I know you're out of my league ♪ ♪ But that won't scare me away, oh, no ♪ ♪ You've built your wall so high ♪ ♪ That no one could climb it ♪ ♪ But I'm gonna try ♪ ♪ Would you let me see beneath your beautiful? ♪ ♪ Would you let me see beneath your perfect? ♪ ♪ Take it off now, girl Take it off now, girl ♪ ♪ I wanna see inside ♪ ♪ Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight? ♪ ♪ Would you let me ♪ ♪ See beneath your beautiful tonight? ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, tonight ♪ ♪ See beneath your beautiful ♪ ♪ Whoa, tonight ♪ ♪ We ain't perfect, we ain't perfect, no ♪ -♪ Would you let ♪ -♪ Would you let me ♪ -♪ See beneath your beautiful tonight? ♪ -♪ See beneath your beautiful tonight? ♪ (people cheering) Taking the Number Nine spot on our list is a super high-octane performance from Mirrorball winners Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold. It's a paso doble, the dance of the bullfight. -Strong, stomping footwork… -Like this. (Latin music playing) Chest held high with confidence and dignity… Like this. (Latin music continues playing) And artistic cape work… Dude, I didn't bring a cape. -(music distorts, ends) -(sighs) A pro never leaves his home without his cape. (Latin music playing) Where did you even get… Here are the champions of Season 25. (people cheering) (wolf howling) ("Animals" playing) ♪ We're the, we're the animals ♪ (people cheering) It was the biggest, baddest paso ever! (wolf howling) (Tango music playing) -Tango. -It's all about passion. Precision. Intensity. The next dance on our list is an absolute masterclass in all three. Fresh from the Winter Olympics, gold medalist Meryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy would go on to win the Mirrorball in Season 18. -She was amazing on the ice… -Mm. …but as you'll see in the dance that came in at Number Eight, Meryl look like a pro, no hesitation, nothing but strength and grace. (people cheering) ("Feel So Close" playing) ♪ I feel so close to you right now it's a force field ♪ ♪ And there's no stopping us right now ♪ ♪ I feel so close to you right now ♪ ♪ I feel so close to you right now ♪ ♪ I feel so close to you right now it's a force field ♪ ♪ I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal ♪ ♪ And there's no stopping us right now ♪ ♪ I feel so close to you right now ♪ (music ends) We're proud of the fact that Dancing with the Stars has always celebrated inclusion, Even after 17 years, the show continues to break down barriers. Season 30 saw our first same-sex pairing, Jojo Siwa and Jenna. Week after week, they never failed to bring us inventive choreography, innovative partnering and fearless performances. Their phenomenal routines rocketed them to Number Seven on our list of most memorable dances. It's a freestyle celebration of self-empowerment. (people cheering) ("Born This Way" playing) ♪ It doesn't matter if you love him ♪ ♪ Or capital H-I-M ♪ ♪ My mama told me when I was young "We are all born superstars" ♪ ♪ She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on ♪ ♪ In the glass of her boudoir ♪ ♪ "There's nothing wrong with loving who you are" ♪ ♪ She said "'Cause He made you perfect, babe ♪ ♪ So hold your head up, girl and you'll go far" ♪ ♪ Listen to me when I say ♪ ♪ I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes ♪ ♪ I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ Don't hide yourself in regret just love yourself, and you're set ♪ ♪ I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ Ooh, there ain't no other way baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ Baby, I was born this way born this way ♪ ♪ Ooh, there ain't no other way baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ Don't be a drag, just be a queen ♪ ♪ Whether you're broke or evergreen ♪ ♪ You're Black, White, Beige Chola descent ♪ ♪ You're Lebanese, you're Orient ♪ ♪ I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes ♪ ♪ I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way, yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh, there ain't no other way baby, I was born this way ♪ ♪ Baby, I was born this way born this way ♪ ♪ Ooh, there ain't no other way baby, I was born ♪ ♪ I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way ♪ (people cheering) One of the questions we're asked all the time is how do you perform an intense dance to a pop song? Fortunately, we have our incredible band, Ray Chew Live, who all work really hard to capture the vibe of the specific dance style, whether that be the intensity of an Argentine Tango, or the authenticity of the different Samba rhythms or beats. I'm still waiting for them to do "My Heart Will Go On" as a jive. You know, maybe it will happen this season, what do you think? Mm, I think we should save it for another season. -Save it? Okay. -Yeah. For Number Six, the pros picked this Emmy-nominated dance performed by Mirrorball champs Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev to a moody cover of Britney Spears' "Toxic". Ooh! (people cheering) ♪ Baby, can't you see, I'm calling? ♪ ♪ A guy like you should wear a warning ♪ ♪ It's dangerous, I'm falling ♪ ♪ With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride ♪ ♪ You're toxic, I'm slipping under ♪ ♪ Taste of a poison paradise ♪ ♪ I'm addicted to you don't you know that you're toxic? ♪ ♪ And I love what you do don't you know that you're toxic? ♪ ♪ With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride ♪ ♪ You're toxic, I'm slipping under ♪ ♪ A taste of a poison paradise ♪ ♪ I'm addicted to you don't you know that you're toxic? ♪ ♪ And I love what you do don't you know that you're toxic? ♪ ♪ I'm addicted to you don't you know that you're toxic? ♪ ♪ Intoxicate me now with your loving now ♪ ♪ I think I'm ready now ♪ (people cheering) And that's how you do an Argentine Tango to a pop song. We're heading toward our Top Five of The Pros' Most Memorable Dances. Before we find out what they are, we've got some other unforgettable moments that were caught on camera. One of the biggest thrills of performing live each week is that you get to see all of the action exactly as it unfolds. And that's why we're so happy to be coming back live on Disney+. Because all kinds of unbelievable things go on in our ballroom. Here are some of the craziest things that happened live on air. But at the end of the day, if you don't keep telling yourself something, you're never gonna believe it. -Like I never… -(growls) (screams) Damn you! Let the baby-making begin! There you go! (laughing) We're getting married. -Is that right? -Yeah, I don't know. (screaming) Bruno, I'll see you in the parking lot. -(laughs) That was ridi… Oh! -BRUNO: How about… Oh! (screaming) You gotta show the gaiety and the fun of the Samba. (all gasp) All right, we're gonna take a commercial break. We'll be right back. (all gasping) Excuse me. Oh, my God. I had white underwear when I started. But probably ain't white no more. -(all groan) -CARRIE: Oh, my goodness. LEN: That was fun, but honestly, it was like being waxed. It was painful while it happened and lovely when it was over. Well, that's live TV for ya! (laughs) Now, in addition to turning our stars into ballroom dancers, we've gotten the chance to showcase our abilities in special numbers. Some of those performances along with our fantastic openings, have earned Emmys. All told, Dancing with the Stars has been nominated for Outstanding Choreography 21 times and won four awards. KYM: No one has been more recognized than Derek, with three wins and 12 nominations to his credit. That's more than any male choreographer in history. DEREK: Oh, sorry, guys. Sorry. I didn't… Didn't see you there. Carry on. (regal music playing) His most recent win for the show is for this performance, which the pros picked as one of the most memorable. At Number Five, here he is from Season 29 with his fiancée, Hayley Erbert. (people cheering) ("Uccen" playing) ♪ Hey ♪ CARRIE: Oh, my gosh! That was insane! ("Work That Skirt" playing) Ah, the Quickstep, one of my absolute favorites. It's a light-hearted, yet elegant dance and the fastest of all the standard ballroom styles. So it stands to reason that a race car driver would cross the finish line with an energetic routine that earned the fourth spot on our list. No one captured joy and happiness like four-time Indy 500 champion Hélio Castroneves and Julianne Hough with what we think is the best and brightest Quickstep of all time. (people cheering) ("Hey Pachuco" playing) ♪ Hey, Pachuco! ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ Summer '43 ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ The man's gunning for me ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ Blue and white mean… tonight ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ Say damn my pride ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ Cats livin' down the east side ♪ -♪ Hey! ♪ -♪ And there's no place to hide ♪ ♪ So I kick it ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey, Pachuco! ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ The final look on Helio's face is priceless. Part of the magic of Dancing with the Stars is when our performances become viral moments. This is one of the most watched, and still racks up millions of views online. It's impossible not to break into a giant grin when you see our pick for Number Three. Get ready, it's a jazz routine from our Season 19 champion and now co-host, Alfonso Ribeiro and Witney Carson. Alfonso quickly danced into our hearts with this viral hit. -Thanks to the Carlton. -Did someone say the Carlton? I did, Derek, I mean, you literally just heard me say it, -but whatever. -It's like-- Yes, I did. (people cheering) ("It's Not Unusual" playing) ♪ It's not unusual to be loved by anyone ♪ ♪ It's not unusual to have fun with anyone ♪ ♪ But when I see you hanging about with anyone ♪ ♪ It's not unusual, it happens every day ♪ ♪ No matter what you say ♪ ♪ You'll find it happens all the time ♪ ♪ Love will never do what you want it to ♪ ♪ Why can't this crazy love ♪ ♪ Be mine? ♪ ♪ It's not unusual to be mad with anyone ♪ ♪ It's not unusual to be sad with anyone ♪ ♪ But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime ♪ ♪ It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ -(music ends) -(people cheering, whistling) That was a pretty good Carlton. No one does the Carlton like Carlton himself. -Oh. -(Cheryl laughs) In 30 seasons of Dancing with the Stars, some of our most successful competitors have been professional athletes, from boxers and swimmers, to wrestlers and baseball stars. Despite their physical abilities, an athlete's size can prove to be a challenge. However, this next couple combine their one-foot height difference with clever choreography for a stunning contemporary routine. This is the dance we think is the second most memorable of all time. It's an Emmy-nominated routine that mesmerized the judges and the pros. Here are Season 30 Mirrorball champions Iman Shumpert and Daniella Karagach.

What's with the hat? -It's not just a hat, Kym Johnson. -KYM: Mm? -It's a hint. -Ah. I get it. It's time. This is the pros' pick for the Number One most memorable dance of all time. This cowboy-themed routine catapulted Dancing with the Stars to the top of the ratings, and is the most iconic dance in the history of the show. In other words, this is the dance that put us on the map. Guys, it really means so much to me that the pros picked this freestyle for the Number One spot. All right, fun fact. When Drew first had me listen to "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)", I turned him down so fast as there was no way I was going to dance to country music as our last dance together. I am so happy we did and the rest is history. In at the top spot, it's Drew Lachey and Cheryl Burke with "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)" from the finale of Season Two. That's right. Two.
