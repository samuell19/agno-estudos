Hey, neighbor. Do you have any idea what time it is? Here or in Bulgaria? What? Sorry, I'm just... I'm still on Bulgarian time. Obviously you're not on California time. I mean, you're walking around in heels with music blasting right above my head. I promise I'll try to keep it down. That would be great. When are the Conrads home, anyway? I'm just house-sitting for a few weeks, but hey, trust me, I'm normally super quiet, just working on my thesis. Okay. Being quiet would be great. Good night. Yeah. That would work so much better. How's 3:00? Awesome. Good morning, Roxanne. Good morning, Jason. - Have a lovely day. - Thank you. William Quinn Resorts and Spas, how can I help you? Molly. Hey, sis! I hope I'm not keeping you away from your thesis. No. How long are you here? Until my next research trip. Yes, of course. And what... what is this? Just some souvenirs from Bulgaria. Thank you very much. Yes. Thanks, sis. So what you working on, bro? Nothing, Tim. Doesn't look work-related to me. Looks more like one of your landscape designs. Aren't you supposed to be in your office doing work right now? When are you gonna tell Dad that you're quitting the corporate life so you can do landscape architecture full time? I'm not telling him anything right now, 'kay? It's not the time. Besides, I'm... I'm busy writing my best man's speech for your wedding. No rhyming poetry. Please? That's too bad. Anyway, here's what I got. "Roses are red, violets are blue"... Little brothers drool. And big sisters rule. - Hey. - Hi. - Two of my favorite sisters. - Hi. What are you guys doing here? Your pistachio cake is exactly what my menu needs. I kind of actually think I could ace this presentation today. And tell me what this is for exactly. A corporate contract with William Quinn Resort and Spa. - Ooh. - They're redoing their entire northern California menus. If I get this job, my catering company could actually, like, work. Wow. Well... But first things first, I have to take this delivery. I have to come back and box up the entire menu before my interview, and still get to the interview. Well, hey, I'll do that. You make your delivery and I'll stay here and make sure everything's ready for the presentation. You're the best sister ever. Okay, I have to run. I'm already late. - Go. - All right there. - I got this. - Okay. What is this? We're doing five events this week? Wedding week was Mom's tradition. Yeah, you know how Mom liked to make memories last. Now, look over the list. You could have emailed me this. I did, and I texted it to you. Wanted to make sure you could attend all the events. Why? We might have a surprise for you. You guys aren't trying to set me up with someone, are you? No, of course not. Just make sure to clear your schedule. Anyway, we're off for a Mani-pedi with the bride. - Bye. - Bye. Don't look at me. I don't know what they're up to. Do you think Jason's gonna freak out? You set me up with Robert. I set you up with Henry. We set up Tim and Nicole. We're three for three. He's gonna thank us. Yeah. I think Cassie and Jason were so great together once. And they will be again. I hope so. Hey. I am ready. What's your ETA? My van broke down. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I'm gonna have to call a cab or something. I'm... but I'm not gonna have enough time to pick up the food before the interview. Can you pack it up and drop it off? Yeah, sure. Send me the address. Here we go. Hey, Jace. Hey. Hey. Good work on the spa renovation project. I mean, you brought it in on time, under budget. That's impressive. Look, we got a busy week ahead. Look at this. Well, you know, why don't I just scale back on some of the events? No, no, your mom would want us to add more events. I mean, her enthusiasm could light a spark in a rainstorm. I got to tell you something though. Ever since you came on board, you made me very happy. Well, hey, I'm happy you're happy. I'm happy. Okay. Hey, I'm here. Where are you? The cab still hasn't showed up yet. - You got to be kidding me. - What? - Ben's here. - Your ex? Yeah, worst timing ever, right? Well, maybe it's perfect timing. Well, you didn't date him for two years. I got to go. Hey, but you're gonna make it, right? Yes. Stall. I'll be there. Hi. Hi, Ben. What are you doing here? Just left an event, and I saw your van on the side of the road. Must be fate. Or a coincidence. I can't believe she's still running. She gets me where I need to go. Except today. You need a lift? Yeah. All right, cool. We can talk. Okay. We finally get to treat the bride-to-be to lunch! I'm so glad you invited me to your wedding, Nicole. Once a sorority sister, always a sister, Cassie. I always thought that too. So did we. That's why you're coming to the wedding week of fun as an honorary family member. I can't wait. So is Jason seeing anyone? Actually, we were hoping that he might be seeing you again. To be honest, I think I... I mean, we may have made a mistake ending things. We never understood why you two broke up in the first place. Wait, you're offering me a job? That's why I was on my way to see you. It's short-term, just one week. Look, I just needed a ride. Look, it's a catering contract for Cosmopolitan Children's Museum. It's a fundraiser, and it's big. Well, I have something big I'm already working on, and I'm really late for it, so... You're gonna be later. Look at this. They got it down to one lane. You've got to be kidding me. Can I use your cell phone? Yeah. Sorry, no signal. Great. Hey, this is Molly Davis. I'm not available to take your call... Are you from Molly Davis Catering? Yes. Ready? I'm just waiting for my business partner. We are on a tight schedule. Could another interviewee possibly skip ahead of us? Deadline's today, and you're the last interview. I'll get the food. Hey, Roxanne, my dad's on a conference call, so I'll take the final interview. - Okay. - Okay? Miss, our executive of operations is ready to see you. You. Wait, Molly Davis Catering? I'm Sarah. I am their food culturalist. Food culturalist? I'm an outsourced contract. Okay. Follow me. Thanks, Roxanne. Okay, go ahead. Well, as you can see, our food speaks for itself, really. You do know that we're looking for a healthy lifestyle menu for our northern California locations? Yeah, yeah, of course I do. Do you? 'Cause you just got here, and you're on Bulgarian time, I think? Time is irrelevant when people gather to break bread. Yeah, sounds new age-y. Your chia seeds and flax aren't exactly what my dad's looking for. I mean, she creates wholesome, homespun meals that really... Yeah, see, that phrase, "homespun," makes me think of butter and unfortunately... What's wrong with butter? Because, actually, in Tibet they use yak butter mixed in tea, and then they add salt and water, which makes a frothy drink that keeps people hydrated and supplies richly needed nutrients in high altitudes. So that's what you do late at night. You look up info on yak butter? Actually, I was up late baking this pistachio cake, which is sugar-free and rich in omega fatty acids. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I just don't think this is gonna work. You know what, Jason? Maybe if you loosened up a little bit, you would see what's right in front of your face. So I should try your yak coffee? No, it's yak tea, and the Tibetans call it po cha. Have a little bit and warm yourself up. You forgot your cake! All right, let's see what this tastes like. I can't believe it. I ruined your interview, the best chance you had at buying your own space. Was it really that bad? It was worse. I guess there's nothing we can do now. Look, it's not ideal, but Ben offered me a job. Working with Ben again? Isn't his business taking off? Yeah, that's the worst part. He's off doing these museum catering jobs, and I have a van that costs more to fix than it's even worth. I'm so sorry, Molly. Look, it's fine. I can just buck up and take this job with Ben. Nope. I'm not giving up. Your food is the epitome of health. Look, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna get you a second chance. Okay. I can't believe you're taking the plunge, man, my younger brother. You need a snorkel? Yeah, you laugh, but if our sisters have anything to say about it, you're plunging next. I knew something was up. Okay, out with it. Okay, Cassie's been invited to the wedding and wedding week. She's not a part of the family. Well, apparently she's the exception per our sisters. Ever since she moved back, Amanda and Lisa have been determined to get you guys together. I'm not getting back with my ex. Our sisters are trying to play matchmaker, so you got to beat them at their own game. How? Bring a date to the wedding. I'm not gonna bring a date to the wedding. Take someone that doesn't like you. It should be easy. I think you need to give Molly Davis Catering a second chance. I messed up, but if you give her another chance, you'll see that Molly's menu ideas are amazing. This is just one of her specialties that I put together. 'Kay, that cake was really good, but my dad is the one who needs convincing. Well, maybe I could talk to him. I'm sure I can convince him that he should... Absolutely not. He's really busy this week. All I need is five minutes. I'm sorry. My... look, my brother's getting married this Saturday. He's booked solid. Unless... Unless what? Well, there is this one thing, but it's kind of out there. I need a date. To your brother's wedding? Yeah, I need to get my matchmaking sisters off my back, and if you show up to some of the events with me as my girlfriend, then that should do the trick. How does this help Molly? Well, you'd have the chance to charm my dad. So I'd get the chance to talk to your dad and really sell him on Molly's catering. Absolutely. Okay. I'll do it. Great. Kickoff dinner is Monday night. I'll see you around 4:00. Good night. Okay, what can we do to help? I doubt the Quinn sisters need any help. We'd just be getting in the way, hmm? - That's very true. - Yeah. All right. Well, Robert, should we find a game on or something? Yeah, there's a football game on right now, right? Yeah. So you'll get the piñata? Yes, and the cake topper. We have to make sure Cassie sits next to Jason. By the time this wedding week of fun is over, those two will be lovebirds at the reception. I hope so. They really do make the perfect couple. Molls, what's shakin', bacon? Hey, Ben, I'll do it. Great. It's this Thursday. Ben, that's, like, so soon. We have to get started on the menu, like, now. That's what I got you for. I couldn't be happier. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Bye. Thursday? Did I miss a home renovation memo while I was in the shower? I'm making room for the baby. Did the agency call? No, not yet. Well, then why? Honey, we got to create the life that we want. That way, if we make room for the baby, then there's actual room for the baby. So you know that's not actually how adoption works, right? Technically, no, it's not, but it can't hurt. If we build it, he or she will come, right? - Trust me. - Okay. I love you. I love you too. I told Jason that I'd meet him here. I cannot let you be his fake girlfriend. I want to help. Besides, it's only a few nights. Okay, okay. Actually, it's a week. You must be Molly from Molly Davis's Catering. And you must be the fake boyfriend. Jason. I'm sorry, a week? Since when? 'Cause I only agreed to some events, like dinner tonight and the wedding. Those are just two of the family events. Can I use your... Oh, by all means, yes. There's a list. So as we know, tonight is dinner at my dad's. Tuesday is scavenger hunt in the park, and Wednesday is lake day. Thursday is a brunch. Friday is rehearsal dinner. Saturday, of course, is wedding day, and that... that's wedding week. And that's wedding week. That's wedding week. But we should actually get going because my dad lives on the other side of town, so... Okay. Cool. Good luck. I need it. It was really nice to meet you, Jason. Nice meeting you. Bye. Boy, oh, boy, something always smells good when you guys are here. It's mom's recipe for roast beef and garlic mashed potatoes, heavy on the sauce. Good, good. - I'm just glad we're all here. - Hi. Hey. What can we do to help? Nothing. You're the bride-to-be. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. Good, good. I'm so sorry to hear that your family's not gonna be here for the... for the wedding week. I know, but they're gonna be here for the rehearsal dinner, though. Good, okay. Cassie's coming. Jason's not interested in Cassie. But you can't stop the Quinn sisters. Jason doesn't know what he wants. That's why he has us. True. I brought chicken tikka masala. Good. That's Jason's favorite. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi, honey. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Great to see you. Okay, cucumber-potato salad, salmon skewers with peppers. Okay, hold on. No. Flame kebabs. Okay, now you're just making dishes up. Okay, you see this box? Yes. Think outside of it. Okay. Okay, well, we should get started. Let's just do it here. All right, you ready? I think so. Let's do this. Uncle Jason! What's up? Uncle Jason! What's up, buddy? Hey, Kate. Hey. - Who is that? - I have no idea. Sarah, these are my sisters, Amanda and Lisa. This is my niece and nephew, Kate and Sam. It's so nice to finally meet you guys. Jason talks about you all the time. We can't say the same. Are you Uncle Jason's girlfriend? Yes, I am. How long have you guys been seeing each other? - A few months now. - A few weeks. We've been official for three weeks, but we've known each other for months now. Right. He practically fell for me on the spot. Well, come on in. Yeah. Hey, after you. Come on, buddy. Hey, Robert, this is Sarah, my girlfriend. Sarah, this is Robert. Girlfriend? I thought... Cassie! Cassie, you made it. Hello, Jason. You're looking well. Thank you. Cassie, this is Sarah. Hey. Refreshments, anyone? Absolutely. After you. Sounds good. I'll see you. - Who is that? - We don't know. No idea. Tastes great, but... But what? We need edgier. There's gonna be a lot of trendsetters there, right? Yeah. We need to be trend-makers. Look, can we just focus on the menu, please? Maybe some inspiration will strike, okay? Okay, okay. Hey. Please let me help. I'm the extra plate here. Jason should have told you guys I was coming, but you know Jason. We do. So do you and Jason hang out a lot or... Yeah, spending every moment we can together. Really? I'm at his office a lot. I've never run into you there. - Well, I... - Hey. Hey, snookums. "Snookums"? Sarah's always teasing me with horrible terms of endearment. Guilty. Let me introduce you to the bride. Great. I can't wait to meet Noelle. It's Nicole. - Right. - Come on. Well, I'll tell you one thing. I don't know what I would do without this man right here. Makes my life easier, but I'm glad that he found the time to meet someone. It's important to have a good work-life balance, you know? Right? I know. Mom always made sure of that for me, didn't she? It will be beautiful. Mom also said it's important to love what you do. - Yes, absolutely. - Right, Jason? She did. Hey, Sarah, did you know Jason helped design the landscaping at the house? I didn't. I didn't. Mom did all the designing for the garden. I did some of the digging, that's all. But actu... Dad, did you know that Sarah works for Molly Davis Catering? No, I didn't know that. Yeah, she... Dinner is served. All right. After you. Well, let's get it while it's hot. Oh, good, I'm starving. The kids want to sit next to Sarah. All right. Hey, guys. So what do you think about that? 'Cause I think it's for the aliens to make space to land their mother ship. Really? I think so. Okay. Well, I am... I'm so glad you're all here, and girls, I think you outdid yourselves this time, so let's dig in, okay? Come on, dig in, dig in. Jason, have some chicken tikka masala. I made it just for you. Thank you. Thank you. There's no way she made that just for me. At least my family liked it. I've never heard so much praise over chicken tikka masala before. Well, hey, you know, I warned you about my sisters. Do your parents live in California? No, they're sort of everywhere right now, actually. They're surgeons for Physicians United. So they set up clinics worldwide, right? Yes. Yeah, we moved around a lot when I was a kid. Moving from place to place must be really hard. It was, but now it's in my blood. Anyway, about Molly. Maybe we c... Well, look, you could talk up Molly all you want, but the key to my dad's heart is through his stomach. Okay. I have a lot of work to do. Yeah, and don't be doing it too late. My thunder feet. Wait, 300 more dollars? I thought you said the repairs would be kept in reason. It just keeps growing, that's all. Yes, yeah, I want the van repaired. I'll figure something out. Yeah, thank you. Bye. Hey, everything okay? Yeah, let's just... You want to take a break? I'm starving. Let's go over to Angelo's, you know, cozy up in our old booth. What do you say? We have that early morning tomorrow. Yeah, okay, cool. Okay. Come on. Hey. Come on in. Sorry, I'm... I'm running late. That's okay. Yeah, I... I like plants. You don't say. Just give me one second, will you? That is quite a balcony. Is that nutmeg? Myristica fragrans. Excuse me? It's the binomial name for nutmeg. It was actually coined by the Dutch botanist Maarten Houttuyn in 1774. You're like a botanical Dr. Doolittle. Not really. Ooh, this is gorgeous. Thank you. Anyway, we should go. Yeah, you're right. Have you got the lists? Yeah, they're in the back seat. Why are you buying baby stuff? It was on sale. Okay, but we've exhausted all avenues, and... Honey, honey, our application's still out there. I know this is gonna come through for us. But you don't know. What? Look, maybe we're all the family that we need, just you and me. Look, they're... they're gonna be here soon. We can talk about this later. This should be fun. Hey, hey, they're here. Oh, good, now we can start. So we drew names from a hat for the teams, but since Nicole and Tim had to cancel... What? Why? Their meeting with the minister just got moved up. I want to be on Sarah's team. Yeah, me too. Okay, everybody has 30 minutes to read the clues, find each treasure that leads to the final treasure, and don't forget to use your knowledge of the bride and groom to your advantage. Good luck. Let's do it. You lead the way, buddy. It's okay. What are you doing? People-watching. Ben, this is great and all, but we have a lot of work to do. We have an entire menu to prep. I mean... The menu sounds boring. Well, I don't think so. It's missing something, but hey, if I watch the water long enough, I'll get inspired. It always works. You know, you should probably just go back to work. 'Kay, guys, the next clue is, "If you stand between this and a hard place, you'll be trapped." I found the next clue! All right. Good job. Let me see it. - What's it say? - Okay, guys, listen carefully. "My rings are not of gold, but they do tell my age." I know, a tree! That was a little easy. Trapped! Okay, wait, I see it. "If you stand between this and a hard place, - you'll be trapped," right? - Okay. Here's the six cigars, trapped. - Right. - I got a feeling we're... I think you're onto something. - This is it. - Yeah. - This is it. - Smart man. Okay, wait, let's go that way. Okay. "I'm empty on the inside, but when you fill me up, kids love me." Look! I guess that would make us the... - Winners. - Yeah, you guys won. I want a rematch. Sorry. Sorry about that. I know you guys wanted to win. Well, good job, Dad. I brought sandwiches. Yeah, this looks really great. Seriously. I'm so sorry. There's some garbage bags and paper towels in my car. I'll get it. I'll c... I'll come with. Okay. Sarah, I'm so sorry. It really did look good. It's all right. Again, I am so sorry. Don't worry about it, honestly. - You know me, super clumsy. - Yup. It's been great spending time with your family again. I've missed these get-togethers. Yeah, they're great. Hey. I mixed the potato salad with the macaroni just like your mom used to. Oh, no. Here, take mine. Thanks, Dad. So... everything all right? Yeah. Okay, 'cause my keen dad powers of observation are in full force today, and I couldn't help notice that you and Henry aren't quite yourselves. We're fine. We're just butting heads over home renovations. Okay, but I made your mother a promise that I would gently nudge... and never interfere. Well, I wish she were here right now. Well... we may not be able to see her, but she is here in everything we do. And, I'm here for you, so whenever you want to talk about it, I'm here for you. Thanks, Dad. Oh, well, all righty, then. Look, I'm sorry. You know, you'll get another chance, I promise. My dad's always hungry. Your dad likes Cassie. Your whole family likes Cassie, and she likes you. She's pretty, smart, a little clumsy, but other than that she's perfect. Why do you need me here? I should just go. I'm not interested. Well, your sisters will make sure that you... Don't listen to my sisters, okay? They're wrong. They're stubborn, but they're wrong. Look, I really want you to stay. A deal's a deal, I guess. I think he might actually like her. I'm not 100% convinced. I need more Intel, and I know exactly how to get it. So about tomorrow, I think that we should just, you know... - Uncle Jason! - Mom said we could have a sleepover. Well, all right. Let's do it. Come on, hop in the car. Don't forget to put your seatbelts on. Thanks. Okay, the museum added 20 more people to the list. That means we got to go big or we go home. What? How about a six-foot Alaska that's baked and... hey. We're gonna be fine, okay? Then we can't do your six-foot baked Alaska. Okay, look, this is why they come to me: giant ideas. Maybe if you hadn't played it so safe, we'd... - I'd what, Ben? - I... I'd have these big, crazy ideas like you? You want to know why we broke up? This is why, because you have these big, crazy, out-of-the-box ideas, but I was always the one who had to make them happen. Sometimes I feel like that's all I was to you. Okay. All right, fine. We'll do it your way: play it safe. All right, kids. Hey, don't touch anything, okay? Come on in. Hey, Sarah, you really don't have to put up with this anymore when my sisters aren't around. I don't mind. It just fell. Hey, I got... I told you guys not to touch anything. We didn't! Oh, well... Well, no wonder it fell over. I mean, look, all the roots are shriveled up. Yeah, I'm sort of a plant killer. But not on purpose, guys. Like, aren't you a house-sitter? So how... how do you... I buy new plants and I replace the ones that I kill. Well, we can fix your plants, right, Uncle Jason? Yeah. So hey, why don't we go downstairs and get those tools, all right? And we'll take care of this. You're a plant killer. Water the soil. You watching? Good. Found another one. I can't believe the amount of damage you've done to these plants in just two weeks. These I watered a lot. Well, overwatering them can be a problem. I mean, you see this right here? Anthracnose. That's... that's why the tips are yellow. These two plants right here have bacterial dropsy. Uncle Jason's a nerd for plants. Mega-nerd. Look, get to work. Ooh. You look like a tropical princess. You too. Thank you. Doesn't Sarah look nice, Uncle Jason? She looks lovely. On that note, time to get you two to bed. Stand up. Come on. We can't leave yet. I need Intel. Where'd you learn that word? Well, I heard mom say that we needed Intel tonight. Now do you understand? Hey, bedtime, come on. See you tomorrow, if we make it. - Hey. - Hi. Sam didn't want me to let you sleep alone tonight... So he asked me to bring you Mr. Bunnyman. - What? - Yeah. Kids had a great time. I did too. I should get back down there. The... they're eating these bedtime snacks, so there's probably cereal everywhere. Right. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey. Do you think I play it too safe? No, of course not. I mean, you may be a bit cautious in the risks that you take, but hey, you opened your own business. If you played it too safe, you never would have done that. Where's all this coming from? Ben. Ben. The place where business and affairs of the heart converge. This mean you'll stick around a bit longer? No. I've got plans. Plans change. Not for me. It's always go, go, go, you know? Speaking of which, I have a really long day tomorrow, so I'm off to bed, okay? Night. Night. Yeah. Hey, get over here. - Hey, bud. - Hi. Hey. Did you have fun at Uncle Jason's? Sarah makes the best fruit salad. You got them to eat fruit. And Mr. Bunnyman had a sleepover at Sarah's. Sam must like you. He never lets Mr. Bunnyman out of his sight. - Who's hungry? - Me. Let's go get something to eat. So lake day is fishing? Yeah. See if we can get you going. Tim, hey, can I speak to you for a minute? And, Dad, can you help Sarah bait a hook? Yeah, absolutely. Send her in. Hey, how you doing? You look great. How are you? Kate said they made googly eyes all night. I guess they really are in a relationship. How are we gonna tell Cassie? I don't know. Come on. Well, usually I use worms. But today I'm going to use a lure. So what you do, see, is you just get this through the hole there, and you spin it, like, five or six times, okay? Pull that tight, and you're ready to go, and that's it. - Wow. - You like that, huh? - Try it. - That was great. That was really impressive. Molls. Did you sleep here? Coffee. I need coffee. A marshmallow roasting corner? There's a patio, which I will be in charge of, not you. Mini chocolate fondue? Since we can't do your chocolate waterfall thing, I made sure every table had a fondue set. You took my ideas and made them... Realistic. Yeah. You said go big or go home, so I went medium. This is amazing. We still have a ton of work. Okay, I'm on it, and I promise to work with you this time. That's good to hear. Well, now's the time to talk to Dad. No way. No, I'm gonna tell him after the wedding. I don't want to ruin his mood by telling him that I'm gonna quit. Don't underestimate yourself. Right. Anyway, Molly Davis Catering uses the freshest fish from the market. I'm talking caught day of. She really cares about all the ingredients. You all right? I'm fine. Really. No pain, no gain, right? That's what my wife used to say. All right, I'll tell you what. Why don't you and Molly put together a little proposal, and I'll take a look at it on Monday. Thank you so much, Mr. Quinn. William. Thank you, William. Welcome. You know, we work really well together. Are you like this in your kitchen? No, my staff usually does most of the prepping, but you know, it's a whole lot more fun when it's just me and you. We have a... we have a lot of stuff to transport tomorrow, and my van is still in the shop. That's fine. We can just take mine and make two trips. Great. How do I have none? Well, it's... you know, it's all in your wrist. You'll get one. I have faith in you. I can't believe you've never gone fishing on your travels. No, my parents were too busy saving other people's lives to ever take me fishing. Well, my parents took us all the time. Your family does a lot together. You're lucky. I mean, you're the one who gets to go out and travel the world, no one to answer to, live your own life. Must be nice. I just got a job offer last week for a landscape architecture firm. They want me to start next month. Jason, that's fantastic. I mean, the money's not that great at the start, but I see a lot of opportunity for advancement. Well, I bet if you told your dad, he would be over the moon for you. I can't just, like, up and run on him right now. Your designs are breathtaking. If you showed him, I know he would say the same thing. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Jason, I think I got one. - Hey, I got one. - Okay, here, hold on. - I got one! - Thatta girl. All right, so... Help, I don't know what to do! Just... hey, it's all in the wrist. Okay, snap it back. I'm so sorry. It's all right. Actually, that hardly got me at all. - Oh, my gosh. - I'm fine. Okay. - All right... - I think... - No. - Oh, no, I lost my fish. Well, hey, I'll bait you up again. - No. - We'll get you one, I promise. Okay. - All right. - That was so close. Hey, what's up, Ben? Hey, does your brother-in-law still work at that car dealership? Yeah, he does. You want his number? Yeah, if you could text it to me, that'd be great. Sure, no worries. Awesome. All right, thank you. - Later. - All right, buh-bye. - That was a lot of fun. - I know. Good times. That was fun. No, that was... it was great. Next time I'll... I'll teach you how to fly fish. Okay. Hey. - Hey. - Is this tuna? - Hey, good news. - Yeah? William is willing to look at your proposal on Monday. No way. What changed his mind? Sarah's charm. No. So you're... you're done with the wedding week, right? No, the deal was I need her for all of the wedding events. Yeah, that's true. I should finish out the week. So what menu should we prepare? I say we go big or we go home. Oh, look at you not playing it safe. I know, I know. Well, William's giving us a second chance, but it's no guarantee, so we have to make sure your proposal is extra special. Okay, yeah. And Garden Delight is where we'll do that. - Brunch? - Yeah. My mom raided her garden. She would make a huge brunch for my sisters' weddings, so we'll do the same. My sisters were gonna go to the deli to get food, so now we can go get some herbs and spices from my balcony garden instead. Yeah, or we can raid the farmer's market. Cool, sounds good to me. I'm super busy with this museum thing, but I probably have, like, an hour. Oh, great. Well, I'll let you two put the menu together, and then Sarah and I will take it from there. Okay, let's get started. Yeah, it's so beautiful. It's gonna be... I forgot the garter. Be right back. I think if Jason and I had some alone time... Cassie... Sorry. Hey, Jason, what's up? Hey, sis. Sarah's making brunch tomorrow. Okay, I will let the family know. Okay, cool. Okay, bye. Bye. Let the family know what? Sarah's making brunch tomorrow. I'm so sorry, Cassie. I guess we were wrong about Sarah and Jason. I should skip the brunch then. No, you're still like family. We want you there. Come to the brunch. I should let Amanda know. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. Hey. So Sarah would like to make us all brunch tomorrow. Hello, Cassie. Hi, Uncle Frank. I need your help. What can I do for you? This menu is going to knock William over. I wish I could help more, but... You're busy with Ben. - Yes. - I understand. You know he's actually gonna help prep and load out tomorrow? He's compromising, and it's kind of nice. Well, you two are good for each other. Kind of like you and Jason. Ha, not quite. We're only pretending. Okay, whatever you say. Anyway, I have to leave for Thailand next week. I have to work on the thesis. Yeah, well, hopefully you'll finish soon. You know, maybe you could settle down. The travel list is long, okay? I don't know when I'm gonna be done. Well, you have to finish soon, right? I mean, house-hopping is not a sustainable career. Right. Anyway, just a few more items and we're good to go. Okay. Lemons? - Lemons. - Two? - Two. - Okay. Hey. Ooh, what are you making? Right now, gardener's pie instead of shepherd's pie. I need you to start peeling. You got it. How's your thesis going? It's coming along. Well, what's it about? "Food is Culture: "A Sociological Study On Culinary History and its Influence On Society." Well, that's a mouthful. Food creates culture, and it gives us a sense of being. So you are a food culturalist. Told you it was a thing. When's it due? When the scholarship money runs out or when I'm done traveling. Well, I got to say that once my dad sees the menu and tastes this food, Molly's gonna be pretty busy. It's gonna be so great. Yeah, it's a shame that her sister won't be there to witness it. I'm not leaving the planet. I'm only going to Thailand. You can't just do your research here? No, I don't think so. California has great food and really nice culture. Yeah, it has a lot of great things. This food's... wow. Yeah, we should probably get to work on it, then. - Yeah. - Yeah. Think about that one. It really... there we go. That's it. Hey, guys, brunch is served. Hey, all right. Look at this. Wow, this looks fantastic. Did you... you did all this, Sarah? She sure did, and it's all made from scratch with recipes from Molly Davis Catering. And, Dad, it's healthy. - I love healthy. - Good. All right. This reminds me of Mom. Well, guys, dig in. Save some room because there's more to come. Yeah, no problem. You did it. We did it. You know, this is the first wedding without my mom, and I was just worried that there wouldn't be any spark... But you brought the spark back. And I really appreciate it. There you are. Jason, your dad needs to speak to you. It's important. I should probably go. Before you do that... why are you saying you've known Jason for months when you've only been here for three weeks? You've been away for two years? The Quinns are good people. I'd hate for them to find out that you've been lying. Look, Cassie, it's not what you think. William Quinn Resorts and Spas is merging with the Calston Group, a chain of golf courses my uncle owns up and down the West Coast. Jason is spearheading this merger. Cassie? Your phone's been ringing. Thanks, Nicole. Apparently I've stunned you both. Jason? A merger? That's awesome, Dad. That's huge. Oh, yeah. I mean, this puts our company into the future for decades to come. What's the timeline? I'd say with contracts, lawyers, negotiations, I say we're about a year out, but with you at the helm, it's gonna be a smooth transition for all of us. All right, I'm gonna go celebrate. Congratulations, Dad. All right. I don't want to fight, Amanda. Neither do I. I'm just trying to process the fact that the life we planned isn't the life you want anymore. I'm just gonna go for a walk. Henry. Anything I can do to help? We've had three adoptions fall through. I didn't want to tell anybody. Why not? Because of that look that you're giving me right now. You feel sorry for us. I don't feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for the poor kid that's not gonna get adopted and be with these incredible parents. I just didn't want my disappointment to be the family's. That's what family's for. I don't know what made me think of this right now, but, you remember the first time I took you to swimming lessons? No, Dad, not really. I walked you over to the side of that pool, and you let go of my hand. You jumped into the water with fierce determination. So where's the determination now? Okay, Dad. Good. Okay. Okay. Hi, yeah, I'd like a taxi to 531. - Hey. - Never mind. - You're late. - Sorry, I lost track of time. I can't believe you. You're doing it again, just like the Brinkman wedding. You're off networking, and I'm here doing all the work. It's not like that. Look, okay, this guy, he's got... I really thought this time it was gonna be about us. When am I gonna be a priority to you? Molls... Look, since you left me to do all the work, the least you can do is transport it, okay? Okay, so you're upset not because I left you holding the bag, but because you think you didn't come first for me? No, I'm upset about both. You know, I thought we could be partners, Ben, I really did, but all you care about is making connections, and I just end up being an afterthought to you. Why didn't you tell me this was how you felt? Because there was no point. Do you want to know where I was? Where? Negotiating a deal on a new van for you with my connections. What? You're not an afterthought, Molls. You're all I think about. Why do you think I asked you to be a part of this museum party? I don't know. Because I thought if we could just work together, then maybe you would see. But you're right. I'll just go ahead and set up. You know, they say silence is golden, but I never really got why they say that or who they actually are. Say what? Sorry, I was just... I was just going over my speech. Not the merger? How do you know about the merger? Cassie told me. How does she know? Uncle Calston. She's part of the deal. That's why she's back. Not the only reason she's back. You can talk to me, Jason. Well, there's just really not much to talk about. This deal's pretty big for my dad. Yeah? What about for you? Tim's right. You should tell your dad. I can't abandon him. Well, wouldn't he want you to follow your passion? Passion has nothing to do with this. Being a landscape architect is what drives you. It gives you purpose. If you don't have purpose, then you're just wandering in your own life. Is this coming from you? What is that supposed to mean? You could just pick up and leave on a dime. In my family, it's family comes first. That's just the way it is. You don't understand that. If that's how you really feel, then I probably shouldn't come to the rehearsal dinner tomorrow. We're only pretending anyway, right? Right. Henry, can you come into the den? You okay? What are you doing? Just fixing our life. What they don't tell you is just how much you fall in love with that little baby every time, and three times now I've had my heart broken. But now I think, what if the fourth time's the charm? You know, what if our almost-baby becomes our real baby? Want to help me paint? Do I want to help you paint? Yeah. I want to help you with everything always. Do you ever have one of those days where you just want to eat your way into oblivion? My whole week. How was the museum party? Ben and I had a disagreement. Can you agree to disagree? No, it's a little too late for that. How was your brunch? You'll be all set to meet with William on Monday. But aren't you... aren't you coming with me? Got to prep for Thailand. So Jason and I ended our deal. I thought you guys were hitting it off. It was just pretend, Molly. Or maybe you're just scared. You know, making connections is hard, and you've had to pick up and go your entire childhood because of Mom and Dad. What if I'm just hardwired to leave because everyone leaves? I just decide to leave first. I bet if you tell Jason how you feel, he won't. He's already made up his mind about me. Besides, adventure awaits. Can you not see that you've been on an adventure this entire week with Jason? Being with him and his family was... it was nice to belong even if it was pretend. Then show him you have his back. What if I try and I'm wrong? Well, you're not gonna know if you don't try. That advice goes both ways. No. It's different with Ben. Is it? Chocolate. Good idea. Would you like some? Well, yes, this is an emergency. That's why I'm calling this late. I need this done now! It's my wedding! What'd she say? I spent this much money... I realize it's 4:00 a.m., but it's an emergency. This is not acceptable! My wedding is tonight! That's impossible. Well, you have to... What's going on? Apparently we just lost the caterers. There was a giant flood and everything's ruined. It's a mess. Can I help? No. I want to help. Can you create a three-course meal in 12 hours? And decorations and a wedding cake? Why not? Molly's a caterer, and I know that we can come up with something, something great. I don't know. That's... this is asking too much for you. No, it's... If Sarah and her sister can work a miracle, I say we go for it. Give me two hours, then meet me at the house. Sarah, hey. Sarah! Hey, this isn't part of the deal, Sarah. You're off the hook. Let me do this. Please. Thank you for getting up so early and rushing out. I know we have barely any time, but the two of us can do this, right? I think I could actually get a third person. Text me the address, okay? Perfect. Thank you, Molly. Okay. Hello? Hi. Did I wake you? No. It's okay. Look, I know that I don't have the right to ask you this, but I couldn't think of anybody else. I need your help. Wipe that grin off your face. How do you know it's on my face? Because I know you, and you know me, so... Name it. He's here. Go. Okay. Hey. - Hey. - You found it. I was given good directions. Your van guy called. You negotiated a really great deal. I still can't believe that you would do that for me. I made a couple phone calls and I got waiters on the way, and chairs and tables are coming. Ben, I'm so sorry. You were right, and I should have just told you how I felt. Well, I'm sorry too. I got so work-driven that I missed the signs, got a little carried away. Okay, but when I get a crazy idea, I go for it. Well, maybe we could try walking with it instead. That's a good idea. Yeah. Look, my job means everything to me right now. But so do you. We both know you're crazy about me. What am I gonna do with you? I can think of one thing. Go big or go home, right? Right. Let's... let's... yeah. Yeah, okay, right, right, right. I don't know if you have the "something borrowed" portion, but, just in case. Are those Mom's? Yeah. She lent them to Amanda, to Lisa, and I wanted to do the same. And being that Tim doesn't wear earrings... - Thank you, Dad. - Thank you. I'm so happy. Thank you so much. I can't tell you how happy I am that you're a part of this family. Well, I guess that's three down, one to go. I really hope Jason holds on tight to Sarah because I think Mom would have loved her. I think she would have too. Polenta cakes infused with basil from your garden sound good. Well, Sarah and Molly know food. Sarah knows more than just food. Amanda and I are giving up the matchmaking business. Really? Well, I'll believe that when I see it. No, it's true. We figured we must not be that good at it if we're forcing our little brother to fake a girlfriend. Yup, Tim told us everything, including the merger. And your job offer, the job you were born to do. Look, this merger is a game-changer for our company. Yeah, but you leading it isn't a deal-breaker. You have to go after what makes you happy, Jason. And that includes Sarah, because what we saw was not fake. You like her. Hey, babe? Hey, babe, they called. The caterers? No, the adoption agency. We have a baby. What? I mean, not a physical baby, but the... the paperwork for a baby. So we have a baby girl? Yeah, but we got to go. We got to sign the papers now. Now? Are you sure now? Yes, I'm sure! Yeah, okay, but the wedding... Baby first, wedding second. - Go. - Get out of here. There's plenty of time. - Go. I promise. - Okay, okay, let's go. You ready? Okay. - Guys, congrats! - Thanks. Thank you. Let me check that out. Yeah, I got all your... Looks great. Fantastic. Thank you. Good. Hey, is there anything else I can do? Sure. We can always find something. - Come on. - All right. It's beautiful. I can't believe you all did this. We thought we'd go big and go home. Now all this wedding needs is a bride and groom. Hey, can I steal you two? Yeah. Bye. It's your big day. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. I'm so excited. Hi, guys. Don't get married without the three of us. We're not here to steal your thunder, but we wanted to introduce everybody to the newest member of the family. Who is this? What's her name? We are thinking Margaret Violet Robinson. After Mom? That's a great choice. When do you guys get her? Hopefully soon. Yeah, we've already converted the den into a nursery, and we're thinking about expanding. Wait, just... let's not get ahead of ourselves. Okay, all right, you're right. You're right. Hey, we should go get ready, bud. Ready? - Let me see this pumpkin. - Isn't she great? She's so precious. I'm getting married tonight. Yes, you are. Hey, come here. There you go. She came, Jason. Sarah's here. You guys can stop pretending that you're pretending now. A deal's a deal. Deals change. She's leaving soon anyway, I think. Well, people cancel travel plans all the time if they have a reason good enough to stay. I'll see you out there. Yeah. Hey, love you, man. - Thank you. - Are you good? Yes. I'm good, thank you. Hi. Oh, this is great. Beautiful wrapping. When the hills are all flat and the rivers run dry, when the trees blossom in winter and the snow falls in summer, when heaven and earth mix, not till then will I part from you. By the power invested in me by the state of California, I pronounce you husband and wife. Go ahead and kiss her! I want to make a little speech. We are so happy to have you as part of our family, and, Nicole, he'll get better with age, I promise you. So yeah, I wish you both joy, love throughout your marriage. Be happy. Be patient. Be compromising. That may be the most difficult of all but, probably the most important. And most of all, be each other's steady rock, okay? Love you guys. Congratulations. To the happy couple. Let's hear it. - Cheers. - Cheers, brother. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Dad, that was a really good speech. Thanks, son. Short and sweet. So what's going on? You seem a little preoccupied. No, I... nothing that can't wait. Yeah? You want to talk in private? No, it's a wedding. The wedding will be here when we get back. You got something on your mind. I want to know about it. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. You still owe me a dance. - You're still on the clock. - Hey. Ooh. We're gonna make it a slow one. Okay. I'm so glad you two finally figured things out. We work well together, but we're taking it slow. He has his catering business. I have mine, separate. Speaking of that, I have something I want to run by you. I mean, you're quitting? You're doing so well. You know, when Mom passed, I just wanted to help you, and I just figured if I joined the company, then the whole family'd be happy. At the expense of your own happiness. Well, your mom wouldn't have wanted that, and I don't want that. And that green thumb you got, that... that's... that's a testament to your mom. So you're not angry? What, are you kidding me? It's a wedding. I'm surrounded by people I love, people who love me. What do I have to be angry about? And now I got a caterer that I got to find because I've got a job for them. All right. - Thanks, Dad. - Yeah, we're good. Were you discussing the merger with your dad? - It's exciting, isn't it? - Cassie... It'll be great working together. I quit. What? Cassie, I'm sorry. I should have said something from the start. Look, we had something once, but it's in the past. I was hoping that you brought Sarah to make me jealous, but the way you look at her should have been my first clue. Look, it's a wedding. Have fun. Enjoy yourself. I hate to admit it, but Sarah's food is amazing. Yeah. Good luck with everything, Jason. Yeah. You too. - Seriously. - Mr. Quinn, you will not regret this. Thank you so much. William, okay? And anybody who can put all this together on such a quick notice is... is more than qualified. - Thank you. - Oh, no, no. Molly Davis Catering, they are well overqualified. Hey, wait a minute. We haven't ironed out the contracts yet. You know, it's too bad you're leaving. You guys could have all worked together. What are you gonna do? - Leaving? - What? Yeah, I resigned. Hey. You guys hear that? What? It's our song. We... we don't have a song. What? Hey, you did a wonderful thing for my family. You went above and beyond. Sarah, I'm really sorry for what I said the other day. I was out of line. No, you were right. I'm a wanderer, a nomad. I had no right to tell you how to live your life. So you're off to Thailand soon. Don't forget to send me a postcard. Actually, change of plans. My thesis is almost done, so I think I'm gonna stay here and help Molly. Sarah... it wasn't all pretend for me. Having you as my fake girlfriend has probably been the most real thing in my life. This past week has been an adventure unlike anything I've ever been on before. Come here. I knew it all along. Me too. Hey, hun, want to shake it on the dance floor? - Sure do. - All right. Let me try one of these, please. Thanks. All right, here we go. Yeah. Oh, man. Wow. This is the best cookie I ever had. Glad you like it. The secret ingredient is yak butter. No. Really? Oh, yeah. Yak butter? - Shall we dance? - Let's go. Come on.
