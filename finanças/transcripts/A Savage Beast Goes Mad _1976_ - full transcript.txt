That's not going to solve this problem! He insisted on driving! You! Don't you think it was irresponsible of you to allow someone with a heart condition to drive a bus? He told me he wouldn't get paid if he didn't drive and wouldn't be able to survive. Is his condition that bad? He's fine with normal duties, but if he continues to be in a stressful situation. What will happen? I'm sorry. So are you saying he'll definitely get into an accident? Is that true? I checked it out. He shouldn't be driving right now. Let's go to the next song. We interrupt our programming for breaking news. Two men who failed an attempt to rob a bank this afternoon around 1:00 p.m. have fled the scene by hijacking a bus.

There has never been an incident in Japan where the hijackers killed their hostages. I'm sure the police will do something. I'm not talking about that. What if they find out about us? What if our names are printed in the papers? The newspaper? There's nothing wrong with a teacher and his student's mother being on the same bus. You idiot! There are those who have their suspicions about us. There are? Who? Never mind. Do something, Mr. Matsubara! What are talking about? Be quiet! What should I do? I'm going to be late. What should I do? I told you to be quiet. That man is acting like he's the boss right now, but the police will arrest him soon and he's going to be executed. What did you say? I'll kill you if you don't be quiet! Oh, no! What? I forgot to turn off the stove. It's going to scorch. You idiot! Turn right. What? The bus is not making any stops? Where?
