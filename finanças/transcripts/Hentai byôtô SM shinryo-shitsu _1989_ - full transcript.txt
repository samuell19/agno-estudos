Pervert Ward: SM Clinic As a psychological counselor, I prescribe a peculiar method of treatment that... involves having patients listen to alpha-wave music and sounds, in order to bring about mental stability. The patient is made to face a mirror. By making them conduct a dialogue with their own reflections, I delve into their deeper psychology. I don't keep video records of the patient's behavior. What I'm viewing at the moment is not the video of a patient, but that of my own wife, Ryoko, in the same situation. I thought you said you wouldn't keep a record? I forgot to erase it. - It happens every now and then. - I see. You're not making a collection, are you? Are you doing the same thing with the other patients? I guess that means you view me as a patient, instead of considering me as your wife. You're my wife. I'm the wife of a sadist. Does that make me a masochist? Dr. Yasukazu Mizumura... You work as a psychological counselor. That's exactly why you need to get your head checked out by somebody. Why don't you just get used to it? Isn't that what a wife is for? Eh? Are you saying that's the duty of a husband? What I needed wasn't a wife at all... It was a masochist... not just yet another patient. A woman who will always be by my side. I don't like being hurt. Please stop already, I'm begging you. I'm your wife. Do it gently. At this rate... I'll surely go crazy. Didn't I tell you that I have a twin sister? I'm sure I told you about her. We look exactly alike. Why not try looking for her? I'm tired. What's the matter? It's been a week since the end of my period. I don't feel any pleasure any more. Second Daughter: Kei Shirakawa Removed from the family registry because of adoption. I'd like to request counselling. I saw the sign. My name is Kei Shirakawa. Kei... Shirakawa. Please sign here. What? You look exactly like someone I know. - I do? - Yes. You're exactly alike... But, now that I've seen the characters you write your name with, I know that you're an entirely different person. Excuse me... I was doing a little bit of thinking. - About the person who looks like me? - Yes. Hey, is that a woman's sixth sense or what? It seems like you're the one who's the counselor. Is it your mother? The person who you say I resemble. It's my wife. You love your wife, don't you? What would you do if she died? - She disappeared one day. - When? Seven days ago. Now, that's enough talk about me... please let me hear about you. - I have these dreams. - What kind? - Dreams about sleeping with you, Doctor. - Eh? I've heard that the percentage of people who go through counseling, that have sex... with their doctors, is extremely high. What's your reason for saying that sort of thing? It's about my dreams. But we've never even met before, right? I look just like your wife, don't I? So do it with me... You have some other objective, right? This dangerous instrument that separated my sister and I... It hurt very much. I couldn't bear it. I screamed, ?Sis, help me!? But she didn't answer me because I'm sure... she was probably experiencing the same pain. This is what cut me and my identical sister apart. It hurt... So, very, very painful... But I can never forget that cold feeling. I think you already know this... I felt a strong sexual desire for the scalpel that separated me from my sister. When it touched the skin where my sister and I used to be connected, I got so aroused that I didn't even know what was going on. You injected me with something yesterday, didn't you? I had a nightmare. I should have been a baby, but I was there on the operating table as an adult, for some reason. The one who separated my sister and I... was you, doctor. It was an erotic dream. Normally you have dreams that are even more erotic, right? The one who separated the two of you wasn't me. Your memory was synchronized with me giving you the injection. You made up a wild erotic fantasy. It was you! You know about the scar where I was separated from my sister. Now you've touched it. Cut me... that is my desire. Your memory of pleasure is from the moment when you were cut apart? That's right. This scar is where my sister and I were connected. There's no such scar anywhere. What are you saying? Can't you see it? It's here, isn't it? Is this how you killed my sister too? So you're saying I killed her? Give me back my sister! I know! Before you came here, you met a woman named Ryoko. I know about it. Please! Cut me! Cut me! Please! Separate me... from my sister! Please! Cut me! I... I felt nothing but hatred and jealousy for my sister, who was being tortured everyday. But now it's different. You helped conceive the child inside of me, so I'm satisfied. A child? I thought you'd just torture me and that you wouldn't have sex with me... but you came inside of me... A child was conceived. Can you tell the result of the sex we just had, right away? I can tell. Your child will surely be born. I'm going to have twins... and, when I do, I'll be able to watch the moment when they're cut apart by the scalpel. You think it'll happen that easily? It's rare for them to come out conjoined. The odds are about 1 in 10 million. I'm going to give birth to that sort of children. You're going to cut my stomach open and take them out. - Caesarian section... - That's right. The perfect fulfillment of both our desires. There is fear of a miscarriage in the event of any more water breaking. Definitely come back when it comes to full-term. Maybe she wasn't Ryoko after all? Why did I end up as a sadist... I think it began with something I did to my little sister as a kid. We were in the bathtub together and I pushed her head underwater. When I came back to my senses, my little sister was dead. I'm a psychologist. Therefor it is odd that I have a past that requires psychoanalysis. I have a mind that tries to make sense of the unfathomable human psyche. That is reason enough to warrant a thorough analysis.
