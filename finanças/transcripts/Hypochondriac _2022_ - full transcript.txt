It's like 85 degrees out. - Yeah, why are you wearing a turtleneck? - Did your mom pick it out? - Yeah, faggot, your mom pick it out? - Jesus, Tye. - What? - Where's your mom, dude? - She's at the mental hospital. - I'll call my mom. - Dad?

Look, look at me. Sasha, can you name three things in the room for me? Three objects. Can you do that? - No. - Red. Red. What rhymes with red? - Dead. - Sure does. Okay, um... green. Come on, green. - Mean. - Okay, your rhymes are fucking negative. Blue, blue. - Fuck you. - Oh! Now she's getting it. Hmm, her name is Sasha. She's here to say That her sign is a Libra and her job is- - Clay. My name is Sasha. I'm fierce if you're nasty. - Hey, hey, nasty. - I talk real nice. - Yes. - And I'm so classy. - Hey. Hey, way to get through a panic attack. High five, yeah? - Thanks. Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm really glad that that worked, 'cause otherwise I would have tried to piss you off, and I really don't enjoy being slammed. - Oh, yeah, yeah. If-the next time you have a panic attack, I... I got you. - Oh, I don't-I don't get them anymore. - Please. - Cured them all by myself, baby. - Lucky you. Fuck. - You all right? You go home. I'll fend off the basilisk so you can sneak out the back. - Thanks, dude. - Yeah. Come here, you're all right. You're all right. - If you could pick up a couple more things, I would love you forever. - Green juice and vitamin B12. - And pick up my dry cleaning? - Got you, girl. Also the kiln door's sticking again. I don't know if you wanna call Juan and have him come take a look? - Ugh, I would, but we just don't have it in the budget right now. Will? Will! - Hey, sorry. That was... Anyway, uh... copy that, okay. Off to get you stuff. - I love you so much. This kills me. If you were straight, I would totally date you. Is that inappropriate to say? Oh, well, if it is, you can take it up with the head of HR, which is me. You're not naked. - Yeah, no naked cooking till we dated for a year. - What do I get for eight months? - Let's see. Baked brie wrapped in a croissant... - Mm-hmm. - With raspberry jam? Mmm! Yeah? I thought you'd be happy. - How was your day? - It was good. Yeah, I filled in as a counselor. An 18-year-old tested positive, so that was emotionally a lot, but I was glad to be there for him. - Luke, the hero, the kids desperately need, and, Will, the sellout, making pottery for the rich. - Right, yeah, okay. Not a hero and not indulging your insecurities today. - But I love when you indulge them. - Hey, do you wanna have brunch with my mom on Sunday? - Sure. What? What'd I do? I ate your last. Sorry, I was high. They're irresistible. - No. It's just Sunday is Mother's Day. - And? - And if my mom died... - Whoa ho ho ho. Relax. My mom's been dead most of my life. I'd love to meet your mother. - Okay. - Lindo, my phone is misbehaving, so I'm sending this to make sure you receive the message and understand. One day you will learn the intelligence that I am capable of. In the meantime, these empty DVD boxes are no longer welcome in my domain. Queen Mom. MMIXX7. P.S. Do not trust Luke. - Hey, Dr. Samson, you told me to call you if Mom ever tried to contact me again. I know it's been ten years, but she finally came out of the woodwork. I-I was wondering if- - Live free, love often, embrace wisdom. Sasha's grandmother's in hospice, so she won't be here today. The shipment should arrive in 15. I have a meeting in Santa Monica. - Your hands okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Are you gonna give me more than that? - It's sore. Didn't eat. - Oh, okay. Caveman Will. Talk to me. - I'm stretching. - All right, well, you have to eat more than one big meal at the end of the day. - I'm fine. I'm more than fine. I am amazing, fantastic, beautiful- - Right, yes. - Sexy - Et cetera. - Okay, hey, what did I tell you about sneaking tastes? - I don't know. When you start telling me what to do, I zone out, you know? - I know. - Go to my happy place. - Yeah. - You know, the one with Tom Hardy naked on the chaise lounge? - All right, out, out, out, out. You are no longer welcome in my domain. Domain... domain... - My domain. Do not trust-trust us. - Jesus. - Sorry, I've been feeling dizzy lately. - For how long? - It's nothing. Never mind. - How long, Will? - Like a couple of days. - Well, you should see a doctor. - That's absolutely an overreaction. - Look in my eyes. Let me-let me see them. - I'm fine. Stop fussing. - Okay, what the fuck was that? - The ring was giving me a headache. - Why are you lying? - Why are you starting a fight? - What would you do if you were in my position right now? - Mind my own business. - Will, it's 7:37 p.m. I'm not sure how much time I have, but you are dating someone- Luke. Don't ask me how I know. I know, but trust me, he's not in your best interest. He is unkind. I raised you to be independent, lindo. You must become a private investigator. I want to talk to him. Please send me his email and phone number. - How's the boy? - Oh, he's there. He's kind. He's getting on my nerves. - Why? - Wants to know things about me. - Real, like... personal things? - Terrible, right? - Dude, absolutely. Boys don't get to know me for at least... six months. - It's been eight. - Oh. Yeah, maybe you're in the wrong here. - Oh my God, you guys! I'm so excited the gallery's ready. The pieces look amazing. I know things have been rough for you recently, but I am so excited to celebrate us tonight. Be there at 6 p.m. - Oh, if you ever want to go to my grandma's cabin, let me know. She has a hot tub, and it usually gets the boys to forget about their problems and shut the fuck up. - Oh, hell yeah. I'll definitely take you up on that. - You okay? - Yes. My finger locked up. I should have stretched it. Will. Will? Will! Are you okay? - Ohh! - I ate today. - What? - I've been-I've been feeling dizzy. I don't know why. - Okay, you need to go to the doctor. Will! - F- - 'Sup, my dude? I'm NP Chaz. What seems to be the problem? - Okay, so... I was lifting heavy stuff at work the other week. I fell, and my arms- I-I landed on them and-and ever since, there's been like a tingling sensation and weakness and sometimes pain. - It sounds like neuropathy. Should go away in a week or so. Is that it? - Yeah... - Okay, cool. - Wait-fuck. Yeah, okay, um... I also... have started getting these dizziness spells and nausea and my brain is foggy and I feel like I can't think. - Hmm. - I was doing some Googling and- - Bro, never Google. - Okay. Anyway, the-the Google symptoms said that they-they could be connected to ALS or MS. - I want you to squeeze my fingers hard as you can. Okay, good. Now close your eyes. Does this feel the same? - Mm-hmm. - And what about this? No peeking. - Sorry. - Does that feel the same? - I... ha, think so, yeah. - Okay, now open your eyes and follow my fingers. Are you stressed? - I-I don't know. - Scale of one to ten? - I-I haven't been eating. - Okay, let's do some blood work. My guess-stress. You'd be shocked at how the mind can affect the body. Also, dude, you need to eat. - Okay. Step-step one, eat. Step two? - Rest. Ice. You're gonna feel better in a week. - What-that's it? - I mean, unless you're the one in 10,000 with a neuromuscular disease. Is that it? - Yeah, yeah-yeah, that's it. - Cool. We'll call you if something's wrong. But we're not gonna call you. - Dear Will, how are you? Two things. One, I have prepared a concept of a play or a movie that I would like your opinion of. I have included books I have read in the last 30 years of my life that meant a lot. This is who I am. Also, I am informing you I have spoken with Luke. He has logic beyond dreams. Hope you're eating five meals a day. Salud! - There are things in my life that are coming out now that I thought I could ignore, but I think... I think they're causing all the shit that's going down. - Doesn't sound like an apology. - I'm used to dealing with this shit on my own. I want to tell you everything, I- I wanna tell you everything. I do. I just... I need some time. When I was 12, my mom tried to kill me, and... that's when we found out that she was sick. You're always gonna look at me like that now. - What? I'm not looking at you like anything. - You don't think you are, but you are. - Okay... look, no one is perfect. I mean, you're-you're 30. You drink too much. You have a-a weird laugh. - My laugh is amazing. Excuse me? - I love you because you're flawed. What? The way you yell at the TV when you're drunk, how you do that little twirl when you're lost in thought, even in public. You have to tell me the bad stuff. We have to be able to rely on each other. - Okay, you can always rely on me. - Well, you have to be able to rely on me too, or else it isn't going to work. - I got the keys to Sasha's cabin for the weekend to rest. Doctor's orders. Maybe we can... Talk about our lives and feelings and stuff more there. - What about brunch with my mom? - Drive home early on Sunday and meet her. I'll do all the dishes. - You will? Okay, what about your arms? - Already starting to feel better. - So are you feeling relaxed? - A bit anxious, actually. I could use a distraction. - So predictable. - What kinda distraction did you think I meant? - Will? - Luke, you dirty devil. Did you mean to think that I had meant sex? I-I would never in a million years insinuate that I wanna be distracted with sexy time. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I need another drink. - Dance with me. - What? - Dance with me. Seduce me with your smooth hips. Distract me from my woes and troubles. - I'm not a good dancer. - You're like stupid good, but you never dance. - What? I dance. Alone in my room when no one is watching. - Okay, then I'll start you off. If you don't dance with me, I'm gonna have to do a striptease to "Out Tonight" from "Rent," and we all know no one wants to see that. Except me. I wanna see that. Come on. - Okay. - Excuse me, I'm leading. - There's no music. - What do you call the crickets outside and the moon and the water that I left running. Okay, also I can count us off, and we'll do the waltz. Hey, I'm holding your hand, bro. - My God. Oh, my God. - And, one, two, three, one, two, one, two. A-one, two. Come on. One, two, three, one, two. Ah, yes, bitch. There you go. - Yeah, I'm doing it. - He is doing it. Badly, but you're doing- - Oh, my God. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. One- - Hey. - I fucking love you. So much. - I love you too. - Good. Now kiss me like you mean it, hot stuff. - No. - Please? - No. - Come on! - Where-where did you get these? - Sasha. - The purpose of this trip- - I know, and we will. I just wanna relax and hallucinate a little bit before I get into my emotional trauma. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Hey. Luke? Luke, you gotta lay on this bearskin rug. It's breathing. - The chair is fine with me. Thanks. - I gotta be outside. - Will, my dude. It's Chaz, how you doing? - Fine. - Cool. Yeah, cool. Well, we got your blood results. - Yeah, are they-they okay? - Yeah, you have a pretty serious vitamin D deficiency. - Oh-oh. - I'm gonna write you a script for some vitamin D, kay? Be well. - We'll call you if something's wrong, something's wrong, something's wrong, something's wrong. But we're not gonna call you. - I need you to be independent, lindo- - Unless you're the one in 10,000 with a neuromuscular disease. Become a private investigator. I raised you to be independent, lindo. Raised you to be independent. Raised you to be independent. - If you're the one in... if you're the one in... if you're the one in 10,000... - There's something really wrong with me. Are there wolves in these woods? - What? What, hey? - Are there wolves in these woods? - Hey, hey, it's okay. Hey, shh, shh. Breathe. Breathe with me, okay? Breathe. Yeah. Again. - Good, good. There are no wolves, all right? It's the shrooms. You thought the bearskin was breathing, remember? What do you need? - Can we postpone our session trauma thingy? I'm- It's giving me a lot of anxiety, and I... I don't know if I'm in the right mindset to... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Will. Will. Help me. I'm stuck. Aah! - Your arms okay? - They hurt. - I take it that means you're skipping brunch. Great. - I didn't do this on purpose. - No, you did. And I was stupid enough not to realize what you did. - I don't wanna fight. I'm in pain. - I'm not fighting. We're still learning things about each other, and today I learned how manipulative you can be. - Whoa. - You will do anything to get out of talking about yourself. The dancing was a nice touch. - Uh... I-I- - It's fine. Don't worry about it. Lesson learned. - Has anything particularly stressful been happening in your life? - Yes. - Yeah. Okay, take your shirt off and I'll be right back. Too cold to keep your shirt off? - I was going to pee. - Okay, hold off on that. Have a seat. Take your shirt off. Okay, breathe normal. You're breathing shallow. Breathe in deep. One more time. Do you feel anything? Any pain here? - No. - What about here? - No. - What about here? - No. - Put your shirt back on. I think it's just stress. - Are-are you sure? - You would be shocked at how the mind can affect the body. All right, but just to be safe, why don't I order you up some creatine kinase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein test. Just so we can rule out ALS or any kind of neuromuscular disorder. How does that sound? - I really appreciate that. - Just down the hall, the red door on your right. Oh, Will? No more Googling. - Yeah. - Yeah. - A week? - That's what the doctor said. - Look, Will, I like you. I chose you out of a hundred other applications for this job. The sad reality is if you have to take a week off, I would have to replace you. - That's not fair. - I'm not in the business of being fair. I'm in the business of high-end pottery. - Hello, Will. This is your mother. I just have one question for you-just one. Do you think your mother's an idiot? You think your mother's an idiot. I'm not the idiot. You're the idiot. Idiot. Idiota! - Hello? Hello? I'm stuck. I can't breathe. Help me. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe, I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Help! Aah! - Why would you touch the kiln? Call an ambulance! I could be liable if- Are you serious?! Fuck you, boss! - Ohh- - So what's going on? Is it your mom? - You shouldn't trust anything she says. - I know. I know, it was- that was pretty obvious from her emails. I get why you didn't tell me that she's alive. When my sister Oded, I didn't wanna tell anybody either. - It's not the same thing. - I know. - Good. Good. 'Cause it isn't. - Why won't you trust me? I'm sitting here right now with you. Let me help you. - Why didn't you tell me that you were talking to my mom? - Because she literally just emailed me. - I think we should break up. I'm at the edge of something that I can't turn back from, and it's safer for you... If you stay away. You already look at me differently and... And I'm getting worse. And if we keep going... I'll destroy you. - Such a martyr. - A I'm not gonna let that happen. - Oh, man. - You're gonna be okay. Luke... You're gonna be okay. - I need to see a psychiatrist now. - I don't know any psychiatrists. - Mom's? Can you call? - Can't do that yourself, huh? - Can you just do it? - I've got a dinner thing tonight in the city. - With who? - You could order Chinese. - We're a couple of sad sacks, right, Faulkner? - Lindo, I'm in Puerto Rico. Where, I will not say. I will not be returning home until I prove it is safe for me. I cannot say much more, but it is extra important that my identity is protected. Imposters are everywhere, Lindo, everywhere. I am letting you know there are items in my study that will change your world, but I don't think you're ready. Also, remember our trip to Adesivo? I found a picture of you naked... Aunty Bertha's house. She's not doing so good. - Fuck. I'm having a panic attack. - Okay. - I can't breathe, and I need help... understand? - Okay. You don't feel panic ever? - No. Mm. Hey, Faulkner. Would you help Will with his... panic whatever? What should I watch on TV? Should I watch the news? - Dad. - All right, I'll watch the news. - Please, Dad. - Can't imagine there'll be anything good on. - Please, Dad, please help me. - Oh, here we go. Another woman comes forward against that congressman. So silly. - Silly? - Yeah, sure. A woman gets raped and doesn't report it right away? She should just remain silent. - Are you serious? - Of course. - I don't even know what to say to that. - You're not a lawyer. - The woman who came out against that tech CEO is still getting death threats. - It was clear from the testimony that there was never any intention to rape. - Did you do that kind of stuff when you were a kid? - No, I was on the swim team. - The Stanford kid was on the swim team. - You don't seem injured to me. - What are you talking about? - You're gesticulating wildly. I guess the best way to get you out of a panic attack is to piss you off. - What happened to your arms? - I got injured at work. And, yes, I am in a severe amount of pain right now. Thanks for asking. Ha. Definitely could use a trim right now, but, uh, it's too painful to hold a razor, so... - Why don't you ask your dad to help you? - Huh? - Why don't you ask your dad to help? He's not gonna shave me. It's too homoerotic. He also doesn't think what's happening to me right now is real, which- Ha ha. Um... I've seen two doctors, and both blood tests have come back fine. They say it's tendonitis. But I keep thinking, "What about the head fog and the dizziness?" And they say, "You'd be surprised how the mind can affect the body." - That is true. You would be surprised. - Fine, fine. Then order an MRI. Make sure. - Do you think that would help? - Yes, I do! I don't care if I have ALS or MS or whatever. I-I just want it to stop. I need to know... if it isn't real. And if it isn't... I'm seeing a wolf. If I'm finally following in her footsteps, I'm gonna kill myself. She has no one. Everybody who's ever loved her she's damaged beyond repair. I'm not gonna hurt people like that. I'm not gonna hurt people like she hurt people. I'm not gonna do it. I won't. - Why a wolf? - Hmm? - You said you were seeing a wolf. Why a wolf? - I... I have no fucking clue. Antipsychotics.? - Antipsychotics.. - Good. I'm not gonna... kill myself. - I know. Do you remember what I said to you right before you left for college? - You told me to run. To run and not look back. - And here you are... - back again. - I can't, not with all the meds. - Hmm. - Fuck. - What's wrong? - Arms. - What, do you need me to cut your food? That didn't hurt, did it? - You remember anything about a wolf when I was a kid? - Just that you were a wolf for Halloween every year in elementary school. - What? - What? - I don't remember that. - Okay. - You still have the costume? - No, your mother probably does. - Anything else? - Well, there was one year when she was supposed to take you trick or treating and, instead, she tried to break into my law firm to prove I was CIA. - I'm going to the house tomorrow. Everything started there. If I go there, I think everything will end. - I think everything will end if you keep taking your meds. - What if things don't stop? - Well, then you really are turning into your mother, and I'll have to put you in a mental hospital. - Hello, Will, I've been trying to reach you. I'm in Puerto Rico. Did-did-did you know that? I'm not doing so good, Will. I found out that my mom is not my mom. She's an imposter. Is your dad an imposter? I know. I know you're not an imposter. You are a good boy. You are good. Are you okay? Do you need money? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Your mother's doing fine. Everything is fine. Ah- What do you think, lindo? Growl for the camera. - Grrr. - Louder, Lingo, louder. - Grrr! - Again, again! - Grrr! - Howl, Will, howl! I'm warning you, you enter my domain again, and you shall be sorry. I am queen. It is my domain, and I shall be very unkind to you if you enter it again. - I threw up again. - Hi, okay, well, what do you need? You want a grilled cheese? Ginger ale. - Okay. - Mom's gonna get you a ginger ale. You planted a bomb? And before you say anything, I ask you this- do you care if I die? Do you care if your wife, your esposa, dies? Dinner's ready! No. No. - What the hell? - What did I tell you about sneaking tastes? - I'm sorry, I-I- I need you to take your medicine. If you don't, I-I will no longer be your son, and I will never talk to you again. Please. - Okay, lindo. - It's time to go. - This is my domain. I will not be removed from my domain. I thought I made myself clear. No, you won't! Aah! No! No, no, no, no, no, no- - MRI came back clear. - Okay. - That's good news, Will. We've done all the tests. You're healthy. It's what you wanted. - What if my symptoms continue? - Then it might be time to see a psychiatrist. You'd be surprised- - I did see a psychiatrist. I'm on Antipsychotics.. - For how long? - Three days. - It takes longer than that to take full effect. Weeks, sometimes months. - What about my arms? - I'm referring you to a physical therapist, but don't start yet, not until the pain is gone. If you don't wait and keep using your arms, we may need to consider surgery. Do you have someone you can rely on until then? Someone willing to take care of you? - Hey. Hey. Hey, it's okay. - I'm so fucked, Luke. - No. - I didn't know what else to do. - I know. - You're the only- only person who actually cares about me. I'm such an idiot. - No, you're not. - I'm such a fucking idiot. - Hey, hey. - Such a stupid fucking idiot. - No. - Such a stupid fucking idiot. - No. - I'm a fuck-stupid fuck- - Hey. - I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you. - Shh. - You're so good to me. You're so good. - Come here. - Oh... Fuck me. Fuck me. - Yes. - Oh, fuck. - Stop. That hurts. That hurts. You're hurting me. Stop- Look at me. - Stop. Stop. Stop. Look at me. - Okay, it's me. Look at me, look at me. Hey, it's-it's me. It's okay, breathe, breathe. Breathe with me, breathe, all right. In... Out... In... Out. - Yeah, good, good. You're okay, you're okay. Every tear Will be a memory - The future is mom: The future is Not ours to see So wait and pray Each night for me Till we meet again - That song. - What? - That... song. Why were you singing that song? - Why? Will, hey. - Why were you singing that? Why? Why were you singing that song? - Hey, hey! Will... Will, it's okay. - You're in collusion with her, aren't you? - What did I tell you about sneaking tastes? You are no longer welcome in my domain. - Oh my God. Luke, why? Why? No... no... Luke! Stay back. - You'll be okay. - Stay back! - Will- - You're gonna be alone for the rest of your life. Just like your mother. - Stop. Fucking idiot. Oh my God, you fucking idiot. You crazy fucking idiot! You're a crazy fucking idiot! Aah! - Well, then you're turning into your mother, and I'll have to put you in a mental hospital... ital... - Luke. - You break into my house. I break into yours. Join me, lindo. I made coffee from Puerto Rico. - I don't want to. - Obey your mother. Drink, please. Good? Are you all right, lindo? You look unwell. - You know I'm not. - Yes, that's why I came, to take care of you until the end. - What? - It's all right, it's all right, lindo. - What do you mean? - We had you tested when you were a child. I wanted to tell you, but your dad, he told me I couldn't. He's a bad man who doesn't know how to take care of people. I should've never married him, but then we had you, and I wouldn't trade you for the world. Sure, I had to give up my career. I was inventor level, but no, I don't blame you, lindo. It's okay. - Shh. - I'm scared, Mom. - I know, I know. Shh, shh, shh. No, no, no. No, no, you're all right. Shh. It's okay. I know. - You wouldn't hurt me. - No. - I know this. Of course, I know this. - Never. Never. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, lindo. Oh, lindo, shh. It's gonna be okay. Shh. Shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. It's all gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay. - Aah! - It's all gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay! Lindo, no, lindo. - Does it hurt? But then it's over. The other way won't kill you. - Morning. - Afternoon. - One, two, one, two. Come on one, two, three, one, two. Oh, yes, bitch there you go. Do it. - Okay, stop, please. - Growl for the camera. - Grrr. - Louder, lindo, louder. - Grrr! - Again, again! - Grrr! - Howl, Will, howl. No, no, please. Please no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Guess I gotta get used to your being here, huh? You look better. So do you. - Thank you. What happens now? What does that mean? - Hi, Will, I'm Dr. Miller. May I come in? Mind if I sit? Thank you. So how are you feeling? You feeling better? - Yeah. - Okay, good. 'Cause, you've been on quite the journey. - Not as epic as "Homeward Bound," but... close. - I see you still have your sense of humor. - She thinks I'm funny. - Who's that? - A wolf. Well, a man in a wolf costume. - Huh. - Sometimes a child. - And where are they right now? Are they... sitting in that corner? - He was, but... You seem to have scared him away. I thought I killed my mom. I-I didn't. I didn't, right? I didn't? - No, Will, you didn't kill your mom. In fact, she was here about a half-hour ago. She wanted to see you, but she was very upset and I thought it was best for her not to see you. So I asked her to leave. Let's talk about you, okay? Would you say that there are some very serious things that are holding you back, preventing you from feeling normal? - I would say that, yeah, yes. - Okay. And that's why I'm here to help you uncover those things so that you can feel happy and whole... and normal. - Well, I like you. - Now, bottom line is, are you willing to do the work? - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Six. That's two more pounds. - Oh, yeah. - You got it. - Yes, it is. - See how steady? - Thank you. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
