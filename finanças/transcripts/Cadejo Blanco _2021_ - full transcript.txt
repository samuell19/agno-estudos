Okay, ready. You like it? That shit is ugly. Oh, fuck off! You don't like anything. Let's see. This one, for sure. Move, help me with this. Please? And what are you gonna wear? What do you mean? You're coming with me tonight. You promised. Wait, I don't remember that. Well, I do, Sarita. Don't make me beg. Tonight is really important for me. And what do I get if I go? I guess I'll owe you one. -You already owe me a shitload. -I'll owe you a shitload more. Sarita, please... You don't work tomorrow, you have nothing to do. Can you go out one fucking night to have fun? Tell the truth-why do you want me to come? Because I love you, dumbass! Bullshit. Stop, tonight's Ladies Night, we'll get free drinks. Oh, how fun! Come on, I'm serious! Tonight is different. Tonight's really important. Why? Because... I'll tell you there. Promise. -Ugh, do I have to? -Come on, it's getting late. I'll lend you something. Why do I have to wear your clothes? I'd rather wear something of mine. Come on, you'll look like Grandma in this. Try this-let's see. Help me. Come on, girl, it's like you've never worn a blouse before! Look, you're all tangled up. I did ask for some help! Okay. There we are, okay. Turn around. -Like this, right? -No. Turn around. Hey... no way! One of my tits will pop out! That's the idea! Grandma, we're leaving. Yes, we'll be careful, and no, we won't talk to boys. Okay? What time will you be home? Don't worry, Grandma. Enjoy your shows! Come on, Sarita! Take that shit off. Hurry! -Hurry! -Wait up. Okay, let's go! Wait! Hurry up, ladies, or we'll leave you here! Look, our drivers are here! At your service, Miss Bea! Let her decide if she wants to have fun. Go try to fuck someone your own age, asshole. I bet your cock doesn't even work. For real, get the fuck outta here. What do they expect, going around half-naked? Wasn't that a bit harsh? They were super old, and you're drunk! You sound like Grandma. Enjoy yourself! And I dance like Grandma too, right? Fuck you, let's get another drink. Excuse me. Okay, look... I have to tell you something. Remember I told you about this guy I'm seeing? Andrés? Well, he works here. His shift is about to start. Thing is, I need to have a serious talk with him. That's why I wanted you here. In case things get ugly, or I fuck up. What do you mean, "in case things get ugly"? -Two Gallos, please. -Two? Okay. Talk with him another time, maybe when he's not working. He's only here on weekends. He's in Izabal during the week. Do you remember I told you I went with Sofi to Antigua last week? Yeah. Well, I was with him. -Girl, why didn't you tell me? -That's Q20. Can you pay? I don't have any money, sorry. Thanks. I know I fucked up by not telling you sooner. I'm sorry. But nobody can know, especially Grandma, so you can't say anything to her. He's involved in gang stuff. Fuck, Bea, another one? -Fuck off! -No! Look... It's a gang from Izabal. It's totally different. It's the same shit here or there! It puts you in danger, -it puts me in danger-- -Wait, Sarita! I knew you'd react this way! I don't need to hear this right now, especially when we're trying to have fun. Please. I just need to talk to him. Okay? Let tonight play out. Thanks for having my back and for being here. You always have to protect your heart, as well as... your pussy. No, but seriously, if you have to escape them, say you need to go to the bathroom. Excuse yourself and leave... okay? -Promise? -Uh-huh. And if you need a condom, ask one of them, okay? There he is. He's here. What's up, Rene? How the fuck are you? Wish me luck, okay? -Should we go somewhere else? -Yes, for sure. Bea? Bea. You okay? Come out. Come out or I'll come in. If you don't come out... Look, you have five seconds to open the fucking door. Four... Three... Two... You want me to fuck that asshole up? How much did you see? Enough to know we should leave. Come on. No! I still have to talk to him. No, we're leaving now! No way! Leave if you want! Have Sofi call you an Uber or something. I'm staying. You're really fucked up. And you look like shit. Bea, I saw you guys fighting. Looked to me like it's over. Fuck you, this is why nobody takes you out in public! Ah, okay. You know what? Let's call Grandma. We can tell her about your gangbanger boyfriend. You know what? Fuck! This is why I always regret going out with you! Besides, I didn't even want you to come. I only brought you so Grandma would let me stay out later. See you at home. Brat. Hey, Agustin. Good, good. You? What are you doing right now? Thanks for the ride. I know it's late. Sorry, I'm not in the mood. I had an argument with my sister. That sucks. Wait. I got you something. It's expensive. It's the kind my sister wears. Thanks, it smells nice. Just five minutes, please? We can park over there. I said I'm not in the mood. And I don't love always fucking in your car in secret! I know, but it's just that if people find out about us, I'll have to figure out how to tell my parents we're dating. That would suck, huh? I shouldn't have called you. But you'll always take my gifts, right? Oh, okay, here. Give it to one of your boring rich girls. I'm sure they'll take it. Thanks again for the ride. Good morning, Grandma. Morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well? Yes. Son of a bitch! I wanted to talk to you both about this. That piece of shit is getting out already?! He can't come visit you if I'm not here. He'd better not try. We have two months, sweetie. There's time. Tell me what else you know. What else do you know? Tell me! Go wake up Bea and tell her it's breakfast time. Now! Hello, Isa? Did Bea go home with you guys last night? No, I Ieft before you did. Okay. Thanks. Ms. Clara! Good morning, Ms. Clara. Morning, honey. How are you? Fine. Have you seen Bea this morning? Sorry, dear. Not today. She didn't come home last night. -You tried calling her? -Yeah, but she's not answering. -Could you do me a favor? -Sure. Please ask Mercedes when she comes home if she knows anything about Bea? Sure thing, sweetie. Okay. Let me know what happens, please. -Yes, thank you. -Of course. I thought she'd go home with her friends. -Turn right, Ignacio. -Okay. But Bea didn't go home with them. -No, it doesn't seem like it. -And who was she with? Was she with a guy?! Was she drinking? What?! I told you she was with friends. But which friends, sweetie? Um, well, Mercedes, Sofi... How many times have I said not to hang out with them?! Have I said that or not, huh?! Okay, that's all the information we need. What happens now? Go home. Keep calling her cell phone. Answer yours if it rings. Let's hope for the best. That's all? We just wait? If you find out anything else, call us. We'll add it to her file. You got to have faith. Good evening, miss. Can I help you? Good evening. I'm here to visit the Rosales Vegas. Can you tell Agustín Sarita is here to see him? Please. Good evening, Mr. Agustín. Yes. There's a girl here to see you. I'm sorry, what was your name? Sarita. She says her name is Sarita. Okay, Mr. Agustín. I'm sorry, he didn't authorize me to let you in. -For real? -Yes, I'm sorry. Okay, then tell him I'll be waiting for him out here. He can come out. -Table eight, please. -Eight. Okay. Where's my drink? Answer me, you fag. Motherfucker. Don't look at me like that. Hey there, what can I get you? -Screwdriver, please. -Your mother's a whore! You piece of shit, I want my drink, you fucking asshole. René! What happened? Make sure that guy doesn't come back. -Motherfucker is too drunk. -Okay. -Another one? -No, thanks. Hey. Did something happen to you recently? It has to do with a girl, huh? Are you a witch, or what? So I'm right? I'm going to the bathroom. Wanna go get drinks with us? I'll call you. So... What did you want to talk about? How long have you lived here? I don't live here. I just work here on weekends. And during the week? Everything okay? I have to go. There's taxis down there. Let's go. At least give me your number. Nice meeting you. Grandma. Grandma. -Grandma. -Mm? Wake up. Your sister or the police call? No, they didn't call. Look, I have to tell you something. Hm? I said I have to tell you something. Wake up. Good afternoon. I'm here to visit the Rosales Vegas. Your ID, please, young man. Thank you. Hello. Excuse me. What's up? -Hey. -Want some? Thanks. A lot of people go to Antigua, and then to the beach. That'd be cool. Thanks for the invite. Um... Sarita-- Don't introduce me. I'm not gonna stay. I have to tell you something important. Are you too fucked up? Or can you remember? Just nod your head. Okay, so I told my grandmother that I'm spending Holy Week at your house in Río Dulce. I don't think she'll call, but if she does, tell her that I'm with you, and we're safe. And if you don't, I'll make sure your whole family knows that you have to go to Zone 8 to get laid. And I can also tell everyone here that, in order to cum, you need two fingers in your ass. Okay. Sarita, wait up! -Where are you going? -To Puerto Barrios. -Alone? -Yeah Take this. We've arrived in Puerto Barrios! Oh, okay. So it's this way, then? Thirteenth Street is this way? Thanks. Excuse me, 13th Street is this way, right? Bring this to the store owner. Then it's gonna ring and he'll give you money. And if he doesn't pay? Don't worry, I have it all under control. -You're gonna pay me, right? -Of course, go! -He gave you the money? -Yes, sir. Pardon me for interrupting, could I borrow your phone? I have to make a call and I'm out of credit. -Sure, okay. -Thank you. I'll call over here. Andrés? This is Analu, from the bar last night. Sit down. You have ten seconds to tell me who the fuck you are and what the fuck you want. I bought you food. Have some, it's good. Do you know who I am? You know what I can do to you, right? I don't care. What do you want? What, you don't like me? If I liked you, I would've said so. Want some? I apologize. My dad got out of jail today. I didn't know where to go, so I convinced your boss to give me your number and he told me you lived here. I'm sorry. Yeah, man. Yeah, I'm coming. Give me a minute. Are we doing that thing or not? What did the boss say? You're sure he said that, right? Okay. I'm on my way. We'll see what's up. Got it. Thanks for the food. -I have to go to work. -This late? Hey, wait! I wanted to ask you-- It's just-- I don't know if it's safe to go back to my house. And there are no buses 'til tomorrow and I have no place to stay. Can I stay with you? Just tonight. There's water in the kitchen and you better not go anywhere else. Your parents? Don't touch my shit. I'm out. -Will you be long? -I don't know. Shit. Are you okay? You don't have to do that. If you have alcohol, I can clean your cuts. Just tell me where it is. It's not mine. What? The blood. It's not mine. What happened? Thanks for the help. I need to sleep. Good night. What the fuck are you wearing? I found it in a drawer. Take that shit off, now! I told you not to go in my fucking room! I know you're in a gang. It doesn't scare me. Grab your things and get the fuck out! What if I want to join? I've been a nice guy, but I'm sick of this shit. Are you gonna kill me? Fuck! Look... I have nothing back in the city. I have no family. I have no house. I have no money. My mom left. My dad would beat me and my sister. He'd do worse things to her. One night, I got fed up. I beat his ass and put him in the hospital for two weeks. Will you let me join? You wouldn't last a day on the street, you stupid brat. When I'm back, you better be gone! -What's up, man? -What's up? -How'd you sleep? -Like shit. -What's up, brother? -Whaddup? Luli! How's it going, girls? -Chilling, man. -Just working. Girls! If you skim off the top again, it's coming out of your pay! -Fuck off! -It's not us. You're crazy. Vicky! Another beer, please. Make sure the boss gets this. This will make him happy, man. Guys, someone's here. Who the fuck is that? No idea. She's not ringing or anything. Any of you give out this address? I'll go check it out. -Is she still there? -Yes! Damian! Come here, man. -Come here. -Keep her here. What the fuck? Okay, man, but you know what I have to do, right? Yeah. How'd you find this house? How the fuck did you find this house?! I followed Andrés. I don't give a shit who you're fucking, you cannot be here! You have two seconds to tell me who the fuck you are. Hurry up! My name is Ana Lucía. I'm a friend of Andrés. My dad just got out of jail and he wants to kill me. I need a place to hide for a while. I want to join. I can help selling drugs or with robberies, too. But I want to earn it. Hold this. Come on. Get up. Don't move. Whaddup, man? -Is the boss around? -He's out, man. ...but she's already seen all our faces. -In forty minutes, where? -The spot. What? Just a heads-up, he seemed a little pissed. Because he's with his family. -Be careful. -Thanks, man. Good morning, boss. I hope I didn't come here for nothing. Hey, kids. -That's the girl? -Yes, sir. She wants to join? That's right, boss. You can vouch for her? Yes, sir. Okay, bring her to the house. If she fucks good, she can work as one of our whores. Boss. Boss. Can we talk? Look, you've already seen me. You can't leave, but you can't stay either. You don't have the face of a killer. And your friend says you don't want to fuck me. For all this to work, we have rules. And if you don't have shit to offer me, then you can't join. I don't really feel like killing you. So what the fuck should I do with you? I was thinking about Oliveiros. We've spent months trying to kill him. And he doesn't know her. We could use her as bait. Fine. Try it. Oliveiros is gonna like you. Make sure that motherfucker dies. I have to get my kids to a birthday party. Let's go. Fifty-five... this one's for them. Jeni! Culy! Where are you? What the fuck does he want? -Who knows! -Yeah. Girls, hurry up! Jeni! Culy! What the fuck?! Wait a second, man! Asshole thinks I can fly. -What's up, girls? -Chillin'. -How's it going? -All good. When's the last time Oliveiros came by? About a week ago. He bought an ounce and left. Was he alone? No, his bodyguards paid. He waited in the car. What kind of car? It was an SUV. A brown Prado, I think. Something like that, it was far away. Okay. If he comes by again, be prepared. Flirt a little, maybe he'll tell you something. -You're gonna try again? -Yeah. Does the girl know what'll happen to her if she can't pull it off? Let's do it. -See ya. -Okay. Let's see what this girl can do I don't think she has the balls. Hey, daddy. What's the latest? You have the money? A girlfriend told me that he was eating around here an hour ago. Where? If you have more money, I'd be happy to tell you. He's having lunch on the pier. Thanks, mamacitas. -Wow, those dark ones are handsome. -Your white boy's cute too. -How's it going? Come here. -What's up? -Have you seen a brown SUV around here? -No, no. This is my uncle. If you see it, he'll give you money. -What's up? -Hey. We're looking for this SUV. Look. -No, I haven't seen it. -Well, if you do, maybe you could call us. Will you take my number? Sure, okay. -58... -58... -42... -42... What's up, guys? -This is where he'll be? -Yes, sir. I'll call and make sure. Good job, Luli. I'm out. My brother's playing. Here you go. Keep your phone on! Always! La Palapa. He's got a table there for dinner with friends all night. And the boss? He gave us the green light? Yes. Guys... If I can't pull this off, is there a way out for me? No. You've already seen too much. You either do this tonight and you join, or... Why'd you come to Barrios? A friend made money here during Holy Week last year. Besides, it's cheaper to live here. And where are you staying? At Hotel Del Norte, across the street. When did you get here? Couple days ago. How long are you staying? Depends on how much money I make. -What's your name? -Ana. -Ana what? -Ana María. Ana María what? Sorry, I prefer not to use last names. What's up, girls? Is she ready? Almost. What did this guy do to make you want him dead? None of your business. Focus on what you have to do tonight. Have you already tried to kill him using a girl? What happened? Analu. You ready? It's time. Twenty. Welcome. Hey! Let go. Shut up and dance with me. If you see me again tonight, you don't know me. You're cute, you can do this. Good luck. Let me buy you a drink. 10 Quetzales, miss. I know all the whores in Barrios. I've never seen you. Why do you assume I'm a whore? Come on, sweetie. -So... how much? -Two thousand. Those are Guatemala City prices. That's where I'm from. New girls are usually free the first time, just to prove they can fuck well. I can't do that. But I can make sure you have a good time. 2,000 is a lot to fuck a girl I don't know. Fifteen hundred and we'll go to my hotel across the street. That way, I can come back here to make more money quicker. Sorry, don't take it personally. You're only worth a thousand. Let's go! But my hotel is over there! I'm not asking. Relax, baby doll. Don't take this personally, either. I need to know who you work for here in Barrios. Who do you pay commissions? Please don't lie to me. It's very important that you don't lie. I don't work for anyone. I've just moved here. I just wanna make money far from home, where nobody knows me. -And where is home? -Guatemala City. -What part? -Zone 8. What street? 7th Avenue, above the terminal. Guys, I know I can be paranoid, but have either of you ever seen her? I live an hour and a half away. Zacapa. I have a big house that you're gonna love. Let's go. If we go to your house, it costs double. Abel, let's go, then! How about this? We'll go to my hotel... so I can go back to the club faster. I'll give you the same price, and we can use the time we'd lose on the road in my room. I swear you won't regret it. Abel... Go park the car. I'll call when I'm done. Let's go, my room is this way. No! I don't wanna fuck where other guys have. You got it? Don Mario. My usual room. -Antoine, room 8. -The big one. Are you sure? Let's go to my room, it's better. All my stuff's there. Here you go, sir. We'll have more fun there. What do you say? I'd really rather-- I have toys in my room we can have fun with. -That's my room! -I don't give a shit. Take off your skirt. Now take off everything. I want to look at you. Wait, I need to use the bathroom. -Is everything okay? -Yeah. -I'm gonna do a line. You want some? -No, thanks. What are you doing in there? Nothing, I'm almost done. Come out, or I'll come in. No, no, no! I'm finishing up. Hello? What are you doing?! Stay still! If you move, I'll cut you. Hold him down! Stay still! Fuck! Hold up his head! Get her up! Give this to the hotel, for the mess. And his bodyguards? In the parking lot, on the other side of the hotel. So, we'll leave out the back. What did the boss say we do with him? Guys? These guys can't dance! Hey, Analu! How are you feeling? Still fucked up. You? I was wrong about you. Why? You did a good job. Everyone is impressed. What? What do your tattoos mean? This is the first one I got, when my dad was killed. In December of last year, I got this one when my mom died. This is the exact time she died, and the Pharaoh God of the Dead, as they call him. I got this one with my ex. She went missing. It reminds me of her. When I find out who did something to her, I'll kill him. Then I'll find a way out of this shitty life. -For real? -Yeah, for real. I just want a normal life... before it's too late. And I have this one so I won't forget to smile. What's that for? I can't tell you. Hey, wait! Andrés! Andrés! Alex, where the fuck is Andrés? I don't know. Fuck this guy. Andrés, let's go! Andrés! Andrés? Andrés? Where's Andrés? Where's Andrés? I don't know. Shit. Get dressed. You're coming with us! Hurry up! Fucking hell. Where are we going? If you see anyone coming, honk. Look alive, guys. Let's go! Get ready, man. What's up? -What's up, man? -Hey, what's up? All good, show him the stuff. Looks good, right? We good? -You got the money, yeah? -Yup. Listen, guys, either of you know what happened with that bus in Santo Tomás? No, we don't. Our friend's girl was on that bus -and now she's gone. -Shit! People are saying it was a gang from Santo... -You were there, right? -No, not at all. -I know you were. -No! -People have said you were there. -No way, man. -You bullshitting us? -No, it's not like that. Yeah, I was told you were there, asshole. Don't bullshit me, fucker. -Don't fuck with me. -No, no. -Huh? I don't give a fuck, shithead. -We know nothing. The girlfriend of one of our guys was there, motherfucker! -Huh?! -Okay, but it wasn't us. Oh, my God. Let's go, let's go! Want some? So we weren't really selling guns? No. Drugs either, huh? Nope. Trying to get some information? Something like that. Are we gonna leave those kids lying there? Yup. And if someone finds them? Here in Barrios, life is cheap. Nobody cares about two dead kids like them. -Not even the police? -Even less. When I was little, there was a gangbanger who lived near me. He was only about sixteen, but he was one of the scariest guys in my 'hood. He loved to steal cars and motorcycles. He must have stolen a hundred of them. One day... I got up early to take my brother to school. When we left the house, he was laying on the ground. He had, like, six bullet holes in him. -Who did it? -Who knows? Someone from the neighborhood, or from another gang. The police didn't give a shit, either. All the adults in the neighborhood were really happy. They had a big party to celebrate that the kid was dead. Don't forget it. Because when they kill Andrés, you, and me, it'll be the same. Nobody will care. We don't matter to anyone. They'll all be very happy we're dead. The boss says it's safe to leave. What's up? So...? It was her bus? Yeah. Let me make some calls to figure out who it was. My ex and I broke up. She hated my lifestyle and that I wasn't around. The last time I saw her... she gave me a choice-- Barrios or her. I told her I couldn't get out, because I owe the gang too much money. She was drunk, angry and she left. Later, I found out she came to Barrios to talk with the gang. She begged them for my freedom. She offered to pay off my debts. They said no, and they put her on a bus back to the city. It's one of the bus companies that we protect. The bus she was on was held up. That's the last time anyone saw her. Andrés... I need to tell you something. We figured it out. The boys we killed were in Chema's gang. -The barber? -Yup. Now the boss wants him dead. Today, ASAP. Because the moment he finds out we killed two of his guys, he'll go into fucking hiding, and we'll lose our chance. No, man, chill. We can't just walk into the barbershop. The minute he recognizes you or me, he'll start shooting. We gotta do this shit fast, clean and smart. We can pay a soldado to do it. Have him bring a girl, so it looks more natural. Do we have time, though? And what if I do it? You ever fired a gun? Try to keep your shoulders steady. Remember, if you miss, walk forward until you hit him. And remember, always aim low for the first shot. Aim for his stomach or his cock. You never point high because the kick from the gun will push your arms up. Once he's down, shoot him in the head and quickly. Analu! Victor will go with you. Make sure you look like a couple. Put these on. -Whose are they? -Doesn't matter. Victor can't keep a gun on him, so you'll have to carry it. Okay. Analu... There's still time to change your mind. Look... My dad, Oliveiros, and this barber all deserve to die. They're motherfuckers. Let's go. Hey, guys. Sorry, this is the last one. It's closing time. It was my fault. I made him late, he picked me up. Do me a solid, man. I just need a trim. -Brandon! -Coming. -Thanks. -My pleasure. When you finish up, call my wife and let her know I'll be late, okay? Yes, boss. Come on, boy, you got 15 minutes. Fourteen. Sit down, asshole. Quickly! What did you do with the girls on the bus? What'd you do to 'em? Tell me. Where are they? You kill them? Tell me. Any bus that stops in my town is ours, too. Hurry up! Tell me, what did you do? Where are they? Tell me, where are they?! I'm begging you, please. I need to know. No, no, no... no! Come on, let's go! Let's get the fuck out! Analu, come on, let's move! Wanna know something funny? When we were kids, this asshole was on my soccer team. He was the goalie. He was a son of a bitch back then, too. I was one as well. Maybe. Who shot him? Not bad, darling. I just wounded him. They killed him. -Did we pay Victor? -Yes, sir. Now we kill the rest of their gang. They all have to die. People can't think they can rob our clients without consequences. Everyone go to sleep! Boss! Can I talk to you? Andrés and Damian, stay here. Everyone else, get some sleep. We'll meet at the house at sunrise. -Everything all right? -Yup. Let's go, we have an early day tomorrow. Come on. You're a piece of shit. I can't believe it took me so long to figure it out. Walk. Walk! You're even wearing her clothes. I'm such an idiot for not noticing. -These clothes belong to my sister! -Oh, now she's your sister? This is all your fault. You put her in danger. Tell me where she is. Your sister is dead, understand?! How do you know? How do you know? Because I know what Chema does to young girls. Get in. Get in! There's clothes and money in there. Leave now. Make sure nobody sees you. If they catch you leaving, they'll kill you. Got it? Understand?! Andrés! Good morning, miss. How can I help you? When's the next bus to Guatemala City? Good morning, may I sit down? Good morning, yes. Could I have sugar and a spoon? Everything's on the counter, sweetie. Hello. Sit down. Breakfast is on me. Sit down, I said! How's the coffee? Did something happen? It's been a very strange morning. First, you don't show up to the meeting. Then I get a call that you're buying a ticket to leave town. I'm sorry. I got in a fight with Andrés-- Shut up! Don't lie to me. A member can't leave Barrios without permission. No exceptions. You know what's the punishment for it? If I can't trust a member of the gang, they have to die. Not just to make an example, but also for our safety. I'll do whatever you want, just you don't kill me. This makes me very happy. I have a question, though. How do I know you won't kill me anyway? You don't really know what'll happen. But what choice do you have? So I'll have to do a really good job with you. Can I wear your helmet? It's just I've never been on a motorcycle, so I'm scared. Come on, hurry up. Your attention, please. Announcing the departure of the 8:30 am Litegua bus for Guatemala City Bus 51 will leave shortly from the parking lot terminal. Please remember to collect all of your baggage. Litegua wishes you a safe and pleasant journey.
