Synced by Anomix33 P.s.: the file has problems. To use the subtitle demux the audio and video tracks separately and remux. Wake up, my girl! The sun is up! Just look! How far the day has progressed. Wake up, my dear! Your Radha is also waiting for you. You have disturbed me for nothing. Where is Radha? She is downstairs in the prayer section. Here! Wear these. I moved them when I swept the room. I don't like it! Keep my slippers in their place! Count them properly. Or there may be one or two short. Is it the first time I am supplying these to this house? Count them and see. Then you can tell me if they fall short. Enough! You start your blabbering just during the Aarti. Put them inside. Chhoti! At least come and stand here for two minutes during the aarti. Your make up can wait until later. That can happen only if your brother-in-law allows me. You are well relieved of all this... ...he's busy himself with the affairs of the village. And ignores you entirely since brother-in-law has involved. Come now, Chhoti! Your daughter has grown up. She too will learn these traits from you. My dear sister-in-law, don't be angry at least during Puja. Oh, yes! Anger, lust, temptation are all housed within me. I am a storehouse of vices. - Over there, there! Give me the keys to the storehouse. - Here! Come along with me! Oh, your dress is very pretty. How much did it cost? Yes, Badi maa, this belongs to Rama. What? You are not satisfied with taking away old clothes? Now you have started taking away new ones. No, badi maa, not new. They have already been worn. Why are you lying to me, girl? When were you wearing them? Didn't I tell you I have already worn them? It's my wish! I can give it to whoever I like. Or throw them away if I so wish. Come, Radha! - Just look at that girl's insolence. Here I am, mother! Give me the prasad. Radha! My word! Are you still angry? Did I say anything? My father and mother were right there? Did they say anything? Badi Maa is always like that. I only said it was a good dress. Did I ask you to give it to me? My wish! I could give my entire wardrobe to Radha if I so desire. How does it concern anyone? Kishenlal, turn back. I want to go back and talk to badi maa right now. No, Rama. Don't say anything to her now. We poor always bear the taunts. Radha! O Radha! Look at me. Here! I am asking you to.. ...forgive me on behalf of Badi Maa. I know she has hurt you. Enough, Rama! Do you want to make me cry? I will make you laugh! Now laugh! Laugh! No? Come! Let's go and fetch some story books from the library. What's there in the library? Zilch? But yes, I am going to get a treasure house of books today. My studious elder brother is coming home today. Deodhar! Deodhar? - Yes, my Uncle's son. Have you forgotten? You used to pester him the whole day. Who used to teach us our lessons. Who used to get you oranges, dates.. Oh, yes! He has finished his studies, has he? No, he is coming home on vacation. He will go back. Which train is he coming by? - He is reaching today afternoon. Then I shall definitely go to the station to meet him. - Rama, you! He is coming home after so many years, the simpleton! Let us see what he is! The train is just coming in. - Radha, Deo will recognize you. There will be no fun then. Hence, you sit here. But how will you recognize him? Why not? I shall recognize the simpleton at once. But it remains to be seen whether he can recognize me. Deodhar? So you are arriving now! Do you recognize me? Who am I? - Of course not! Why would you recognize me? Staying in the city all these years.. ...has made you a city slicker, hasn't it? - Who, me? Oh, Rama! This is...! Didn't I tell you that the city boy would not recognize me? Now, do you see? Kishenlal, keep the gentleman's luggage in the buggy. Come along, sir! So! You are doing your Ph.D., are you? You have become a Doctor! Me? I show samples to Doctors and take orders for medicines. What? What? Tell me again! I..nothing! Can I ask you something else? In all these eight years you didn't remember me even once? I did. Very often. Night and day. - But you couldn't write a single letter. Why? - Give me your address. I shall definitely write in future. Oh, go on! You will write now! Why didn't you think what face you would have when you met me? You were bound to meet me some place or other. After all the earth is round. Oh, no, no! How can the earth be round? Won't the people underneath fall off then? Kishenlal! Stop the carriage. Who are you? Till now I was Fatehchand. But now I do not know. Then why did you say you were Deodhar? - I did not. You didn't say? - No! - Then how did you sit in the buggy? Are you telling lies? - O, why would the poor fellow tell lies? When did he say he was Deodhar? Listen to me! Lies! Get down right now! Down! Down! Take your damn luggage too. Run away now, or I shall beat you up. What is his fault in this? - Let go of my hand. Manorama! - Let go! My foot is stuck here! You wench! You have been looking on all this while. Could you not have told me? Oho! When did you give her the opportunity to say anything? Keep quiet! Let's go, Kishenlal! I'll see you at the house. I'll teach you a lesson you will not forget in a hurry. I see! So this is what she is doing here. You slut! You had set out of the house to go the temple. Is this your temple? And who is this? Your God? I had only heard rumours till today. Today I have caught.. ...you red-handed, you whore! You are rubbing my nose in the ground? Come on home. I shall cut you in pieces. You slut! Are you not ashamed? Maito! What is this nonsense? I am still here to take a decision in the matter. Tell me what it is. She is not satisfied with having swallowed up her husband. Now she wants to be a whore as well with this vegetable seller. Aren't you ashamed abusing your daughter like this? What is her fault if her husband has died? The fault lies with this bastard who has enticed this widow. I shall punish him for this. - Back off, Thakur. You should have confirmed the facts before laying the blame. This is not justice! - Vir Singh! I shall not permit any injustice. Come here, boy! What is your name? - Gidhara, sir! Do you do any work? - I play instruments at wedding ceremonies. At other times, I work in the fields. Can you look after the girl? Will you marry her? I will, sir! Maito! Give your daughter in marriage to this boy. What are you saying, sir! This society will shun me. Sir, is there no such thing as custom, tradition, law? Customs are made for man's convenience, Maito. Is not man who is made for customs. My dear sir, I did not recognize you. Do you live in this village? How will you? Kings do not remember the favors made by them. Sir, this is my nephew, Deodhar. It was you who financed his studies in the city. He has been under your care in your house. He has returned from the city only yesterday. Come and meet me at my house. I would like to talk to you. Of course, sir! The rich and mighty have their own rules. The poor have no choice but to agree. Can I ask you something, Thakur? - What? You were ready to flay the poor man alive the other day.. ...for such a small thing. I wonder if the widow's beauty.. ...had something to do with it? Society's unwritten laws and codes are protected by zamindars.. ...and people like me. And we shut the mouths of people who talk low like this. Ha! Shutting my mouth will not change your character, sir. You use women for your pleasure and throw them away.. ...like empty liquor bottles. The only difference is you pay for.. ...your liquor before, and mine after. Greetings, sir! - Greetings! Why, Radha, haven't you earn to wish people? - Huh! Deo is already in the living room. What are you doing here? So much chilli powder? Let's have some fun. He is setting himself up to be a doctor, right? Let him tell us what lies inside this kachori. Greetings, Raja Thakur! - Welcome, Pujari! Greetings, Raja Thakur. Chhote Thakur! How are you? - Your blessings, Raja Thakur! You called for me, so I came along. - Yes, yes! What did you say your name was? - Sir, it is Deodhar. Deodhar! Do sit down! Not there. Over here, close to me. Deodhar! - Yes, sir! You are a strange fellow! You are sitting here. Come on up. Let's go! - Oh, let him sit with me too for two minutes at least. Not now, Bade Babu. Later! After all, I too have been waiting.. ...for the last eight years. Come on! - Go, Deodhar, go! Meet your aunts as well. - All that can wait! First he will meet me. Come, come, dear sir! Now we shall serve you! Hot, hot kachoris! Special breakfast for a special person. Eat and see! You will remember it for a life time. So you are giving your exams in private! - Yes! In Private! You eat your kachoris. - What are your subjects? Is it necessary to conduct all your enquiries at this time? Badi Maa says.. When eating, you should only concentrate only on the food. Here, eat! The aroma is great! Oh, I've dropped an apple. Please pick it up. Did you get hurt? - Please have your breakfast. I have made these kachoris with my own two hands. Especially for you. It's really quite good. Why don't you eat too? It is very good. You must eat too. Water! Water! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You fed me with chilies and are giving me water on top of that? O, what shall I do? I am not going to survive this. You're very wicked! You're very cruel! I shall never speak to you again. Radha! - Coming, Bapu! I am talking about Satyanarayan puja. And you are asking me what prasad to make? Greetings, badi maa! - Hey, don't touch me! Can't you see I am wearing my puja clothes. You are a strange man! How did you get in? Who are you? I am Deodhar, badi maa! When did I say you were not Deodhar? But that does not mean you should push your way into this house? Go out! This is not the audience hall of bade Raja or the chhote Raja. What are you looking at? Go on! Hey! Haven't you gone yet? Watchman! Watchman! Catch hold of this boy and throw him out. Well, well! You have a wonderful way, badi maa! Is this the way to treat a guest of the house? Do you know he was Deodhar, the nephew of the priest? What? He was the priest's nephew? And drunk? Did you see him getting drunk? Why do you talk uselessly? He was hiccoughing because he had eaten chillies. Then why didn't you say so? He will come back! You have yourself thrown him out. Now you say: Call him back. Oho! So why are you shouting? Why shouldn't I shout? She didn't even stop to think. How much he taught us in our childhood. You threw him out without even knowing the facts? - Enough! Where will he go? To the Pujari's house? Go and call him back. I know where he would have gone. You don't have to tell me. Bookmark! So you will remember which page you were reading. It is true, Manorama, that you are rich and mighty. But that does not mean that we poor people do not have our dignity. No, that wasn't good enough! Anger doesn't come out well on an empty stomach. Have your breakfast and then express it. It will come out fine. There are no chilies in this. Honest! Go on! Eat! Manorama! This is a great way. You pester me yourself and then you start weeping. What did I do? You accuse me of all sorts of things.. ...and on top of that, you will not even let me cry. What did I tell you? Then was it I who said you are great and we are small? Did I ask the good God to make me take birth in a Thakur's house. So that Deodhar could lecture to me and so too Radha? And there is badi maa? She will vent her anger on me. She asked me to go fetch you. Otherwise I would never have.. ...come here to appease you. I am hungry myself and am still telling you to have your breakfast. And you spilt the whole thing in the mud. Oh, so that is the true story. It was hunger that caused all this. Oh, all right! Here! Eat it! - No, I don't want to eat it. You eat if you want to. Otherwise, throw this too in the mud. Are you going to eat, or shall I force you to. There isn't a person born who can force me to. - Is that so? Here! - Please don't pester me. Otherwise, I shall bite you. Oh, big deal! Let's see you bite me. Bite me if you can. "Nothing appeals to you" "when this disease takes hold of you." "I am struck with love." "Do treat me with medicines." "Go and find me a physician." "I am struck with love." "I wonder what this world" "would be like if there were no love." "If there were no appreciation of the seasons," "if there were no flowers, gardens," "anything could have happened," "but this world would not be so." "Immerse yourself in these thoughts of mine." "Go and fetch me a physician." "I am struck with love." "That person is indeed fortunate" "who is struck with the disease of love." "Who has no notion left of happiness and sadness" "and who is caught up in his world" "he laughs to himself," "he cries to himself," "even if this disease is without a cure." "Do get something done." "Go and fetch me a physician." "Treat me for this condition." "If there is none available," "at least call my love." "Go and fetch my heart-throb." "I am struck with love." "Do treat me with medicines." Oh, this is a serious problem, Lal Bihari. Why are you wasting your knowledge on me, Panditji? Do tell me something! - How can I? Saturn is in a very inauspicious position. This year will be difficult for you. There must surely be a remedy for this, Panditji. Of course. What else am I sitting here for? The remedy is a little difficult. Do tell us the remedy, Panditji. I am willing to give up my life for his. Good! That is exactly what you have to do. My meaning is we shall have to cut off some years of your life.. ...and put them into Lal Bihari's. So do it, Panditji, what are you thinking about? What is there to think about? I just want to ask you. It's a question of some four to five hundred rupees. Four to five hundred? - Everything will be done at one go. That is true. Here! Keep these hundred rupees. I will give you the rest little by little. Come, let's go! Here, keep another twenty rupees. And since you are adding.. ...to my longevity, you may as well put in another 20-25 years. After all, what is it worth to a woman? Don't worry! I'll do just that! Drink your milk! - Panditji! Think carefully before you transfer the years of my life Panditji. What would happen if you transferred everything over to him and Saturn were to grab me instead. Here's fifty rupees. Keep it! You need hardly tell me that, Bhabhiji. I will transfer the years in such a way.. That you will pass away a bare week to ten days before Lal Bihari. When you yourself are not there what will he do with an extended life? Right Panditji, I'll take my leave of you now. How much has blind superstition taken root in our country. That was great, Mamaji, just great. How you fooled them. And that too in the name of religion! The pity, dear nephew.. ...is that nobody does it out of religious beliefs. Everybody does it out of fear. If I had told him the truth.. ...that Lal Bihari, this year will be just great for you.. ...then he would not have given me so much as a fiver, leave alone 500. Your uncle wants to marry off his daughter. And that requires money. Look, what a great match we have found for her. It's hardly likely that some prince will come forward to marry your daughter. Do be practical, Premvati. Of course, I have matched the horoscopes. Our daughter will dine well. Meaning, she will rule the roost. Uncle, he seems a trifle aged to me. And it is not even four months since his first wife died. This was the only groom left in the whole wide world for my daughter. Are you discussing me? Oh, this fellow is bald. Oh, Deodhar. Do come in, my son. Greetings. Shouldn't you have told me the other day that you were Deodhar? I did tell you, badi maa, but.. ...but you didn't recognize that I was badi maa, right? My blessings! O chhoti! Look who is here! He used to be so small. He used to wear long, torn shirt all over the place.. ...with nose running. Our Pujari's sister's son. See! His parents died leaving him helpless at a young age. And your brother-in-law sent him to the city, educated him.. Enough, Jiji, are you going to recount the entire story. My respects to you, auntie. Long live. Give this to me. - What has happened to your hand? Oh, a cat bit me! My God! Then you will have to have 14 injections in your stomach. No, that is only for dog bites. Oh, I know that. But some would treat cat bites in the same way. Yes, it was a cat that bit him. Oh, who told you? - Who else would you tell? It was I who bit him. What? You have grown so big. Aren't you ashamed of biting? Isn't he ashamed? He isn't hurt at all and yet goes about wearing a bandage. Show me! One should learn from him how to make excuses. What a crazy girl. If you warm and apply the black ointment it will become all right. I shall apply it for you. I don't know when she will learn. What if the poison had spread? If you are hurt, it is bound to give you pain. Why are you shouting? I didn't intend to bite you so hard. But why did you say.. ...that I couldn't bite you at all. That is why I got so angry. Now what are staring so fixedly for? Aren't you going to say something? What shall I say? If you want to scold me, you can. I will listen quietly. No, Manorama. I can't even think that. Then what else were you thinking for so long? I was thinking, Manorama, that all human beings are the same. The same two hands, two, feet, eyes, ears, face.. ...everyone has the same parts. Then why is it that one.. ...just one, appears so loveable that even if one has to give up.. ...one's life for that person, it would be done happily. O, Deo, does it really happen that way? Yes, Manorama, that is indeed how it happens. Does that mean I too shall love someone so dearly? It will definitely happen, Manorama. Who has been able to escape these bonds? Neither the maker of this universe.. ...nor those who live in it. This is a gift of the Gods.. ...after finding which, a person begins to find meaning in life. Hey, Manorama! You are coming now? I have been waiting since so long. And the great man walks in so casually. Are you going to stand there or are you coming down? Oho, you seem to be very angry. Kishenlal informed me only just now. Do you know, I didn't sleep the whole night. On top of that I am so troubled. Won't I get angry? What is the reason for it? Your talk of yesterday. What else? What talk? - What you said about me falling in love one day too. Just one thing I must ask you, then I shall be satisfied. Deo, have you ever been in love with anyone? Yes, Manorama. I was, am and will be in love. I asked you for an answer and you are giving me a lecture. I am asking you..listen! Turn the other way. - Why? Do whatever I tell you to. Turn the other way. But what will happen if I turn the other way. - Please do it! I feel shy to tell you what I have to say. "Why does the day break?" "Why does night fall?" "Where does this pain rise from?" "Why do these eyes cry?" "What is this thing called love?" "Do tell me." "How many musical notes it has?" "Let me hear them." "Till the evening, there was one bee" "that was humming around a flower." "As soon as night fell," "he was enclosed in a lotus petal." "When he got out of captivity the next day" "I asked him what happened." "He said nothing, he said nothing," "but kept singing as if in a trance." "What is this thing called love?" "Do tell me." "How many musical notes it has?" "Let me hear them." "Why does this breast heave?" "Why does my breath burn?" "What kind of fire is this?" "Why does this flame burn?" "When the flame is burning. - The moth too has come to it." "And surrendered itself to the flame's embrace." "I asked it what was there in the flame lit by another." "He said nothing, he said nothing," "but kept singing as if in a trance." "What is this thing called love?" "Do tell me." "How many musical notes it has?" "Let me hear all of them." "What is this intoxication?" "How does one stagger around?" "One can see nothing." "How is this mischief?" "One day when I was passing by a wine shop." "One drunk was staggering along," "full of spirits." "I asked him why he drank all his life." "He said nothing, he said nothing," "but kept on singing as if in a trance." "What is this thing called love?" "Do tell me." "How many musical notes it has?" "I would like to hear them." Let me go! Let me go! Sit down! - What? - I said: Sit down. Look, Radha. I don't have the habit of beating around the bush. Hence I shall tell you straightaway. Can you come and meet me at my lakeside bungalow. What for? - Why do Thakurs call girls to their lakeside bungalows? Don't you know? If someone said the same thing to Manorama, what will you say? Huh! I'll shoot him. But knowing she is the daughter of a Thakur no one will dare. And since I am the daughter of a poor priest.. You can say this to me. That is true. - Do I look like a street walker, Vikram babu.. ...that you are offering to buy me? I am agreeable to this proposal, father. You may give him your consent. What are you saying, my dear? Why are the parents of a young girl eaten with worry? This is something I have understood today. I like this man. Get me married to him. No, Radha. Are you going to marry an older man? It's not likely that a prince will marry me. I am a poor priest's daughter. Perhaps you have forgotten that you have been brought up.. ...as a helpless orphan by the same poor priest. What are you trying to say? Say it outright. Nothing. Deo bhaiyya, you must recognize Manorama's position and your own status in life. In this world we stay in, love.. ...is seen in a dirty way. Dirtiness, my dear Radha, is in the thoughts of those.. ...who peddle hate and mistrust in place of love.. ...and create differences in terms of position in life. Love is a disease that does not strike one easily. And once it strikes, it does not leave you. Manorama is doing you a favour by talking and laughing with you. Don't make the mistake of thinking it to be love. Otherwise you will get nothing other than regret. No, Radha! That is not so! I have faith in her! I am sure.. ...that Manorama loves me as much as I love her. Do all girls get married? Yes, Manorama. Forgive me if I have said anything wrong, Dev bhaiyya. Before I leave, I would like to say this: Draw a lesson from me. There can only be union among people of the same station. Don't worry, Radha! I shall go tomorrow to the Thakur and speak to him in this connection. There is no need for me to say anything about Veer Singh's.. ...child, Raja Veerendra Pratap Singhji. You can see for yourself. Where is Manorama? Munimji, go call her. Could you bring along Kunwarji? I would like to see him myself. Sure! I'll call him. - I'll take you with me. I too have heard a lot about Kunwarji, Rajrani. One should not believe everything one hears.. ...until one sees for oneself. Yes, She would be very lucky, who engage with Kunwer. Yes why not? Brother-in-law! Would you come here? Arise Sister! Jiiaji has come. Take a look at him. I hope you didn't have any trouble getting here. Brother-in-law, this is older mam, and this is elder mam. May you live long, my son! I am sure you have brought your horoscope with you. Yes, it is with bhabhi.. - I'll give it to you right now. All human beings are alike. Then why is it that there is one.. ...person who appears so loveable that even if one has.. ...to give up one's life for him, one would do it gladly. My respects to you, Badi maa! - Now you come! Here! Look at this horoscope quickly and tell me how well. Kunwarji will suit our Rama. He will suit her fine, badi maa, particularly as you have chosen him. Now if I can get Rama's horoscope, I can match the two. Come, I'll give it to you. You wait. Come with me, Pujari. Come, come inside. Sit down. Now make the horoscope. - But.. The horoscope is not to be matched, it is to be made. Sir, what are you saying? How is this possible? After all there is such a thing as custom and tradition. Don't teach me custom and tradition, Pujariji. I will not let such a good match go away for the sake.. ...of your superstitions. Here! Make such a horoscope for Rama.. ...that it matches Kunwarji's in all 32 aspects. If their Panditji sees it, he should say: Wow, how all the planets meet. What a superb match. Oh, Deodhar, come! Come on in! Never mind, Deodhar! Let it be! Come on in as you are. You have come here on a very auspicious occasion. My respects to you, bade Raja. This is our Pujari's nephew. He studies in the city. And this is the Raja of Sumergani, Shri Veerendra Pratap Singhji. And his younger brother, Kunwar Narendra Pratap Singhji. Deodhar, I am very happy today. When Rama was born.. ...I had decided that I would wed her into a much greater.. ...family than mine. Today my wish is about to be fulfilled. Kunwar Narendra has come to see our Rama. I am pleased to meet you. Please sit down. Oh, you can sit later. Go and see why Rama has not come down as yet. Go and bring her. Go. - Yes. He is a fine boy. Rama, you are looking like a fairy. Come along now. My respects, chhoti maa. Dev. Where were you, Dev? I have been calling you since so long. He has come, do you know? He is sitting with bade babuji. Go and meet him. I have just met him. - You have seen him? How did he appear to you? I liked him very much myself. He is a very big man, Dev. His father was the zamindar of 30 villages. Even now they have mills and factories, farms, houses. And lots of cars. Do you remember? You said something the other day and it has turned out to be true. What was that? Didn't you say that all human beings are alike. But there is one who appears so loveable that.. I felt that this is he. Congratulations, Manorama. My heartiest congratulations. Rama! Come down! Quickly. Dev, you are so good. Do this work for me. Take the tea down to the guests in my place. - Rama! Dev! - Come, Manorama, they are waiting for you downstairs. Bade Raja Thakur! Come, my dear, come. Veer Singh! Why don't you show Raja Saab your garden? Please come! Please sit! Come, Deodhar, come along you too. Is this how tea is made in your house? No, that is not so. Here, let me make another cup for you. It's all right! - Drinking black tea makes you turn black. That is what badi maa says. But I am already black. As for you, you are so fair.. ...I do not think you ever drink tea. Are you making fun of me or are you speaking the truth? I am being absolutely truthful. - Then it's all right. Ask me quickly whatever it is you have to ask me. Then I can go. I have nothing to ask. - Manorama! Listen to me! Let her go! She is feeling bashful. Why don't you tell me something about Ramaji yourself? Sir, I? - You must know her quite well. No? Where did I get to know her well? But yes, I can definitely tell you that she is very innocent. She is very good. Pure, clean and delicate. I have never seen her feet on the ground. Keep her safe. That is all I can pray of you. Right, mother. We are going for an evening walk. Do whatever you want. Why ask? I am not asking you, I am telling you. Why are you feeling shy? Come on. Very good! Good! Mother! Film star, Lalita Pawar. Oh, see the slut's appearance. Her father goes from door to door reading kathas, and the daughter aspires to be a madam. Wish you a long life! There is still time for the train to leave. Go past the haveli and bid everyone goodbye. Okay, babuji. My respects, auntie. Go to the haveli. My respects to you.. Chhoite Raja Thakur. I was returning to the city. I thought I should take my leave of all of you. Chhote Raja! Are you still angry with me? I had begged your forgiveness the very same day. No, no, nothing like that. Which train are you going by? By the afternoon train. Bade Raja Thakur is upstairs. Do go and meet him. - Right, sir! I am taking my leave, Manorama. Go on, then. Who is stopping you? Are you angry with me? Who am I to get angry with you? You care only for Radha. And now that she's gone, why care about me? God knows that what understand himself. Go on, now. Why aren't you going? Rama, what is the matter? What are you saying to him? He has come to take his leave. He can't wait till after the Radha's wedding. Then he has no work that time. Now he becomes a great worker. He says he is leaving by this afternoon's train. If he leaves, I shan't get married. That is the end of it. She is a very stubborn girl. Nevertheless, if you can wait.. ...for the marriage, it would be nice. As you say, bade Raja. Look, he has agreed to stay. Compose yourself at least now. You start sulking for every small thing. Would it really affect your work in the city? Is it really necessary for you to go? No, Manorama. The truth is that I wasn't quite happy here. Because Radha has gone away. But I'm here. Is it not? I amuse your heart. It's only a matter of a week. Then you can go away. Okay, Manorama. As you wish. How nice you are. I do like you. "These streets and squares." "Do not come here ever again." "I have become a stranger." "You have no one here of your own." "Take away colorful memories, the joy of smiles and tears." "On my wrists I have colourful bangles," "I have grown to like them." "How they glitter, these bangles on our wrists." "They are like you these bangles of mine." "You have seen my henna-stained hands." "They look colourful on my palms." "Why are there tears in your eyes?" "They will spoil your kohl-stained eyes." "The monsoon brings clouds." "I have become a stranger, now." "There is no one here of your own." "Oh, mother, do embrace me." "I am off to my in-laws." "I am leaving my childhood behind In your courtyard." "The sun will come out tomorrow as well." "The birds will sing tomorrow, too." "Everything will be as usual, but I will not be here." "Take me into your drape. Think of me in your dreams." "I have become a stranger now." "There is no one here of your own." "Do take a last look at me," "I have to go very far." "My mischievous acts," "keep before your eyes." "When the bells tinkle, when you feel lonely," "do not think I will be on my palanquin." "These are just for a few days, celebrate with me." "I have become a stranger now." "There is no one here of your own." "These streets and squares." "Do not come back here again." "I have become a stranger now." "You have no one here of your own." Radha! Darling! You look foolish indeed. But where is my darling wife? She is probably sitting in some corner. Go find her. Flowers for you! Rama is getting married. I am going to attend her marriage. If you go, I shall be left alone. I shall become sad. I am not going alone. You are coming with me. Understand? What? Do I have to go with you? Oh, Okay. Five minutes. Five minutes? - Oh, I understand. One minute! One minute! Heavens! He's gulping the entire milk again! Just like his father! You, Radha? You've come now? I wrote so many letters to you! - Slowly, my dear! I'm going to be a mother. - Really? Come with me. How is your husband? Any problems? He takes me to the movies... .. to dinner and in the evenings we go for walks... If I say it is day, it is day. If I say it is night it is night. Of course, he does pester me a bit at night. - Pesters you? When your prince comes into your life, you will understand. Tell me clearly, Radha. What does he do? What all men do. - What does he do? He is a mouse during the day. But at night, he becomes a tiger. He gulps a liter of milk, and then he is all over me, the rascal. This milk is a curse to us girls. Oh! I am so afraid. What else does he do? Oho, he picks you up and close to him. - Then? Then he beguiles you with his sweet talk. - Then! Then he touches you. - Then? Then this. You have a child in your stomach. Oh, God. I shan't let him touch me. "From his heart I have landed in the marked." "My dilemma is that I have landed in a big perplexion." "Those who keep meeting enter the heart." "Those, who despite meeting, never meet, are missed a lot!" "Was this love?" "Was this love? Or something else?" "Neither do you know nor do I!" "Was this just a mistake of the way to understand things?" "Neither your mistake nor mine!" "May the bed of your happiness continue to remain bedecked, forever!" "May the years of my life be added to yours!" "I was busy praying for you, I was busy wishing for you!" "Neither did you know nor do I!" "Bestowing upon you all the happiness!" "I depart after losing everything!" "This was the tradition of love!" "Neither did you know, nor did I!" I used to think that the girl whom my brother in law.. ...will marry, will be very fortunate. But no. Looking at you I feel that my brother in law is more fortunate. Praise her a lot, and how much you want. But afterwards you'll regret it on seeing her fuses. Don't try to fool me by your words, brother in law. First pay the price, and then enter inside. I will take such fat gold bangles. Oh! Sister you turned out to be such a fool. You have asked only gold bangles! It's enough? If you had even asked me a necklace worth Rs.9 lakhs.. I would not refuse and give it to you. Well no problem, you can. You can ask me now also. Ask. No, brother in law I will not ask anything from you now. But I will ask him Who gives everybody. May you live a long life. Sister in law! Come on in, why are you standing out? And one more thing brother in law. Tomorrow she has to go to her house, so let her sleep a little. One more thing, I have boiled milk and kept it there. See that you drink it before it gets cold. What happened? Are you really going to drink milk? You had said that by drinking tea the skin becomes dark. Does drinking milk also cause something? Don't take me to be a fool. I know after drinking milk, you will harass me. Who told you that I will worry you? My friend Radha has told me everything. Her bald husband drinks milk and worries her a lot. But I'm not bald, look. Don't try to fool me? First promise me you won't drink milk. Ok. Alright. - And also that you won't worry me. Ok I will not worry you. Not like this, touch me and take the promise. I promise for you're sake. I was getting scared to touch.. ...you as I did not want your fair body to get stained. The loss will be mine and not yours. What do you mean? - You will not understand. Come, rest a little. You must be tired. Don't you have trust on me? I'm finding it hard to believe in my destiny. I'm so fortunate that I've got you as my wife, Rama. So loving, so beautiful, so innocent. I think so I might have done a lot of good things in my past life. Don't you think so? Rama. I've brought tea brother in law. If you'll say I'll take it back. Live Long Life. I think so you were awake all night. Is it so daughter? Live long daughter. Has he worried you too much? As soon as I came I went to sleep. If he worried me in sleep then I don't know. What would I do, sister in law? As soon as she came she took a promise. And you only told that she is a delicate doll. So I did not want to create a problem or harm her. Hail brother in law! How come you are born in this bad era? You should have been born in a better era. Oh! Sister in law, what great happened? My whole life is ahead of me. You are right, but for now her brother has come to take her. He is sitting down. Come on, daughter, drink your tea quickly and get ready. I am putting the breakfast on the table. Why did you tell her about the promise? Next time, don't let me take a promise and I won't tell her. Are you angry? - Then what! I am coming to take you day after tomorrow. Rama! Slowly! Slowly, now even I will become a mother. Has Dev come or not? I wanted to ask him a nice name. Dev has gone to the city but what nonsense are you saying? Yesterday only you had gone to your in-laws place. How do you know so early that you are carrying a child? Brother in law. The truth is that I do not want to go. Who can leave such a beautiful sister in law and go? The thing is that big brother married you first.. ...otherwise I would marry you. When I got married and came in this house.. ...you didn't even know how to put your pant well. But now I know. - What did you say? You scoundrel! Joking like this with me who is your mothers age? Thirteen days have passed, since her husband has died. And her in-laws have not answered yet. They should have at least sent a message. Who have lost their son just after the bride stepped in.. ...must be cursing their destiny. God knows in which bad day they had decided the marriage. Are you in your senses or not? You didn't even have any sense, to cut her hair by now. I won't let them cut my hair. You have to let them cut your hair daughter. But why? Oh! Rama, why don't you come down? Now you cannot wear this daughter. Where is this girl? How much time does it take to come down? Mom, I don't want to cut my hair. What? You won't cut your hair, then will you do makeup? Have all these widows cut their hair because they are fools? Have I purposely become a widow? See what she is saying? What bad will happen if she doesn't cut her hair? Nothing must have happened in your parents house. But if anything bad happens here.. ...you will not be able to show your face to anybody. We will do everything according to our customs and traditions. What are you saying? The world has changed now. I ask, what great problem will arise if she doesn't cut her hair. No problem would arise even at that time. Then why didn't you say anything.. ...when they had cut your mother's hair? That was a case of age difference, aunty. But it is not necessary that because mistakes happen.. ...we must repeat them again. If you do not repeat customs and traditions.. ...you will be separated from society. Whatever happens, Rama will not let her hair be cut. If you do not want to follow customs and traditions.. ...then why have you called us here? For a meeting? Believe it or not, you are responsible? Come on everybody they have called us here for no reason? And have worried us. No, no, don't do such a mistake. Please sit. On behalf of them I ask you forgiveness. Whatever you say we'll follow. Sit down. Please. I'll see to it nobody dares to stop her from cutting her hair? If you turn your face away from society.. ...then where will you keep your daughters and sons. They will remain unmarried life long. Now will you sit quietly or should I force you to sit? For what are you starring at me Godavari? Make her sit! Mummy. What happened to you now? Do you want me to fix a date for you, to do this? No, no madam. Big daddy. Wait a minute. Oh God! What is all this happening? What are you people doing? How can you agree to cut such beautiful hair? Oh madam, what rubbish are you saying? She's right; Such beautiful hair will cause havoc. I don't believe in all this. Don't feel bad when I say that.. ...Rama is not your daughter anymore.. ...but the daughter of my family. This was so the instant she had got married. Whatever has to be done we will do it. I have come to take her. I need your permission. To hell with the world, what have we got to do? As you sow, so shall they reap? Manorama! Come, have your breakfast. What are you waiting for? Bring it in. Since when have I told you? You are bringing it now. And, Guddu, drink your milk quickly. Otherwise your aunt will be angry isn't it, Manorama? Here, drink it. What do you want for lunch today? Oh, I do not know. Ask your young mistress here. But, didi, I do not know anything. Then get to know it. I have done a lot on my part. Now give me leave. And take care of the house. Here are the keys. In this bunch, you have the keys to the storehouse.. ...the cupboards, and the safe. Bholu will explain the rest to you. No, rani, you shouldn't do this. No. I cannot do this. Let me lie quietly in some corner of the house. Don't concern yourself with me. I am not doing anything, my dear. I cannot even do anything. But I will say this. This house is your own. You are the queen here. You'll rule here. Control yourself. You have your whole life before you. You will have to live your life. Control yourself, my dear. This is a bookmark. So you will remember what page you were reading. Please don't pester me. Otherwise I shall bite you. Aha! How can you bite? Show me. Now why are you staring at me so fixedly? Why don't you say something? What should I say? If you want to scold me, you can. I shall listen quietly. Dev, have you been in love with anyone? Yes, Manorama, I was, am and will always be in love. I cannot forget you, Manorama, I cannot! I know I have no rights over you. But I am helpless. I am in love with you, Manorama. I can only pray that wherever you are, you be happy and free. Guddu, you are cheating? I'll show you, just wait. Where will you run? Here, I've caught you. I don't like these wedding ceremonies. But what can I do? Our relationship with the Chowdharys is such that I cannot but go. And look, your brother-in-law has not yet come. Otherwise I would have given him his dinner before going. I'll give it to him, didi. You can go ahead without worry. Okay, Guddu. Don't pester your auntie. On the contrary, I take so much care of auntie. When there is no one in the house.. I am the only male child in the house. You have started talking too much. Okay, I shall leave now. I am getting scared, auntie. Please sleep here with me. Don't leave me alone. Hush! Brave children don't get scared. Come! Rairani! Oh, I was putting Guddu to sleep and fell asleep myself. I thought it was my wife. - Never mind. She has gone to a wedding at the Chowdharies. She will be back late. Shall I give you your dinner, brother in law? - No, you go! Did you want something, Jethjii? No, no. I simply came here to say: What if Narendra has died? I am here, his elder brother, Thakur Virendra Pratap Singh. Don't worry at all. Your hair is beautiful. You are beautiful too. Let go of my hair, Jethji, it hurts. It will hurt just a little. But thereafter there is only happiness. Don't be afraid. Nobody will say anything. After all, Narendra was my younger brother. What is the difference between him and me? If you like, you can look on me as your husband. Yes, there is such a custom too. Auntie! Auntie! Where are you? Auntie, auntie! Open the door. Guddu! - Auntie, auntie! Why don't you say something? Mother! Auntie, auntie! Auntie, auntie! What happened to you? Why were you screaming? Mother, look what's happened to auntie. She was screaming. Manorama! Manorama! - I want to go back to my house, jiji! Yes, Manorama, I made a very big mistake bringing you from there. From birth, we have been taught that a husband is God. Whether he treats her like a slipper or his property. If I say a word against him, my tongue will be slit. But I will definitely say this.. That in the middle of these high roofs and.. ...behind the marbled walls of the Thakurs, there is only suppression. I have no choice but to live here and die here. I do not have the courage to get out of here. But you still have your house, to which you can return. Go, Manorama. Go back to your father's house. Go back! Who has come, Munimji? Rama has come, sir. Rama? Rama?! Now I shall never go there, mother. - Why? You went away saying you wouldn't live here. What happened now? Jiji! - And the rairani who took you away to rule the house.. ...does she not have the decency to come by and leave you here? She sent you with a servant! Is this the way to talk to a daughter who has just come to her house? How else does one talk? It is easy to say. But it is not easy to take care of a widow. Didn't she send you back like a counterfeit coin? Now where are you going that way? Of course, she is going to her own room. She no longer has a room upstairs. She will stay downstairs. Where your mother stayed after becoming a widow. And you go and take care of your office. There is no need.. ...for you to interfere in women's matters. Everything will happen according to custom. Understand? Maharaj! Bring the keys and open the room. Rama! I am feeling afraid! Tell me the truth. What happened? Tell me, Rama, tell me! Rama! Rama! Tell me, Rama, on my oath. What can I say, mother? Last night, my brother-in-law.. ...pushed his way into my room and took me by force.. Enough, my girl, enough! I suspected this! Don't ever speak about this with anyone. Understand? Never speak! You don't know these Thakurs. Their noses are held very high. They will put a bullet into him. And another into you. And the rest of the bullets. No, My dear, no! There will be corpses strewn all over the place. Put a lock on your lips, my girl. A lock! O, Dev bhaiyya, you? You have changed completely, Radha. How are you? - I am fine, how are you? How is brother-in-law? Everyone is fine! - Good! This is for you! - Come, come in! Oh, where is your luggage? I didn't bring any luggage. I am going back by the evening train. That's just too much! You have come after so long, and you will not even wait? Come, sit down. - Nothing like that, dear! It's just that I was feeling a vague fear during the past few days. When I couldn't bear it any more I thought I would come and see you. Dev bhaiyya! - Yes, Radha! Who else could I ask about Manorama? It is only you I can ask. I did the wrong thing, didn't I, by warning you? Who knows, perhaps you too would have come together. No, Radha. You did well by warning me well in time. Manorama is after all the daughter of a noble family and.. ...I, how can I ever give her all that Kunwar Narendra Singh can give her. So how is Kunwarii. Is he all right? Dev bhaiyya!! - Tell me the truth. Is Manorama happy with him? They are both happy, aren't they? Radha! - Dev bhaiyya! Tell me the truth, Radha, on my oath. How can I tell? A cataclysm has befallen her another will fall on you. Rama became a widow on the fourth day after her marriage. What happened to all your shoes and slippers, Manorama? Which ones, Dev? The ones from Sirikotta? No, Rama, don't cry! I received such a lot. But look, now everything is gone. Don't say that, Manorama. Everything will be okay. Well, tell me about yourself. How are your studies going on? Have you become a doctor? No, Manorama. The work isn't done yet. You are probably not concentrating on your studies. There is no one there to scold you. You could have remembered me. Shall I take my leave of you now? I don't eat after sunset. I haven't had my food either. Won't you ask me to come along? Will you come? Then come. It will be good. I shan't have to eat alone. Maharaj, Dev will have his food with me. Send his food here. Manorama, you haven't eaten either. I cook and keep my own dinner before going to the temple. Because there is no time left when I return. Doesn't Maharaj cook food for you? Maharaj has lots of other work. And I am idle all the time. Hence, I thought it better to cook my own food. At least I can spend the time. Come! Where are you going? Your room is upstairs, Manorama! No, I have come to stay here now. It is easier to come and go to the temple. Come in! You stay like this? Maharaj! Yes mistress! - Please send some kheer into the sitting room. I'll just leave this tray inside first. Who has come? - Deodhar babu has come. He is sitting in bitiya's room. I am keeping the tray here, bitiya. Take it. Why didn't the Maharaj bring the tray inside? Perhaps he was in a hurry. Sit down! Eat! - And you! I shall eat later. You go ahead and eat. How are you, Deodhar? - My respects, chhoti maa. Please sit! You eat too! As it is, you eat only once. If it is past nightfall, you won't be able to eat that either. You eat this food? - Badi maa says this is the proper food for widows. This keeps the mind calm and one does not get evil thoughts. So you can stay a corpse. That is why you are given food. They have prepared kheer today. Shall I get you some? No, mother! - Why not? Eat it. Wonder why they feel bad about it? Dev, don't get up while eating. It amounts to contempt for food. Isn't there contempt felt by living, breathing human beings? You are full of pity for me, aren't you, Dev? But I have learnt to put up with everything. Why did you learn? Why? You are doing gross injustice to yourself, Manorama. And this is a sin. Doing injustice and putting up with injustice too. You are committing a sin, Manorama. Everyone has become my enemy, Dev. You too have left me with tears in my eyes? I cannot see you living like this, Manorama. I have hurt your feelings today, Manorama. Forgive me. But I cannot see someone dying little by little under the.. ...weight of customs and traditions. Manorama! - What is it? - You are very angry, aren't you? No. - Of course you are. Can you at least forgive me? Yes. No, not like this. Yesterday, I committed contempt of food, didn't I? Today I would like to make amends. With you. It is not necessary. Then it will be a problem. I had told my auntie that I would bring Manorama along with me. She must have even cooked for you. You know it, Dev! I only eat what I cook with my own hands. Yes, yes, Auntie too has cooked according to custom. No, Dev, I only eat once a day. But listen, eat now and don't eat in the evening. I don't think you ate even yesterday. Tell me the truth. Did you eat? - No. But why don't you understand, Dev? Everybody will be waiting at home for me. No one will so much as think of you. Yes, chhoti maa would probably be worried, but I have informed her. Come on! Dev! You are compelling me far too much. Because you have given it up. Come on. Yes, brother in law had come. But he was insisting that he would have to leave today itself. I told him several times not to go, but who listens to me? I don't eat all this, auntie. I've only served you a very simple fare. Do eat it. - It's not like that. There are no chilies in this. Truly. Look, I'll show you. Here, now you eat! Here! - No Dev. Will you eat quietly or shall I force you? Then you can bite me all you want. I shall have fourteen injections in my stomach if necessary. No, No! Oho, auntie, do we have black ointment in the house? Keep it ready. Manorama will first bite me, then she will tie.. ...a bandage on it. What do you say? Manorama. What is this? You break out crying while laughing. I had quite forgotten laughter, Dev. Why are you making me cry? You shouldn't do this, Manorama. It's as though you have completely forgotten laughter. Smile a little. Your smile will bloom like a hundred flowers. Just try laughing once. Millions of flowers will bloom and scatter. Yes, Manorama, please laugh! "The bee made the flower bloom." "The prince took the flower away." "O bee, don't forget to say flower." "May you live long." "The bee made the flower bloom." "The prince took the flower away." "O bee, don't forget to say flower." "The flowers have all scattered." "Sad and happy times come and go." "There is no hunger for happiness." "Nor worry about sadness." "Where love beckons one." "Sad and happy times come and go." "Meera drank from the poisoned vessel" "and turned the poison into nectar." "Kabir uttered the word 'love'" "and broke into song." "Sad and happy times come and go." "O bee, don't forget to say flower." "The past has been left behind." "The bee made the flower bloom." "The prince took the flower away." Oh hell! I had to see a widow's face early in the morning! God knows what will happen now. In my case, the Thakur asked me to get my daughter re-married.. Now that his daughter is flashing eyes at others, he is silent in the matter. And that too with whom? The pujari's son? Are we dead? What is it? - There! Dev? There are no stars studded in this. What is this you are doing, Dev? Please move away. Everybody is watching. Let me go. Wear your slippers, then you may go. Go on, wear it, my girl! Don't break your lover's heart! He is doing a religious duty. After all, it is the pujari's teachings. Wear your slippers quickly, Manorama. Don't exceed your limits, Dev! Even stubbornness has its limits. Dev, what is this nonsense? Enough of this play-acting, Pujariji. Don't play innocent. As if you did not know at all what your nephew from the city was doing. Make him sit backwards on a donkey, blacken his face.. ...and parade him all through the village. That will bring him to his senses. You have shown everyone a very good way. But will you also tell us the reason for this? Oh, how innocent the poor boy is. She is a widow. Don't you know that? Can one of you tell me what is a girl's fault in her becoming a widow? The sun does not deny her light. Flowers give her their scent. Nature does not change its laws for anyone. Then why do you compel her to walk with naked feet, eat.. ...a spartan diet, and sleep on a thin mat? Why can't she laugh like other women, be happy like others. Cannot love anyone, cannot marry anyone.. Yes, why not? Will the heavens fall? What nonsense are you talking, Dev? Do you know that for a widow.. Even to think of love and marriage is a sin. It is unnatural. - And when you married off your only daughter.. ...to a man twice her age, whose first wife had died.. ...not more than four months before didn't anyone see any sin, anything unnatural, any injustice in it? Wow! What kind of two-faced logic is this, mamaji? Different laws for a man and a woman? Why don't you speak for yourself? Are you marrying her or are you tying a rakhi on her wrist? Why? Isn't there any relationship apart from marriage or the rakhi? I would like to hear what that is! What relationship did he have before whom.. ...you have come to make obeisance? Had he married Radha? Or did he tie a rakhi? Are you casting aspersions on our Gods and Goddesses? Beat him up! Catch hold of him and beat him! Beware if anyone so much as touches him. I'll break your bones. Let it go, Kedara. There is no fault of theirs in this. People have always reacted in this fashion.. To those who have loved truly. How can you expect them to understand the sacred love of.. ...Radha and Krishna when they have not understood the love of humans? They only know relationships that have been made by men. ...Husband, lover, brother, friend..the language of love.. ...is far above these relationships, my friends. He is quite right in what he is saying. Oh come! It is one thing to dally all night with a woman.. ...but ask him, will he marry a widow? Yes, I will. I will marry Manorama. - Dev! Yes, Manorama, I will make you mine. No, Dev. I shall continue living as I have lived. I shall endure.. ...all the pain, the humiliation, the taunts of this world.. ...but I will not be able to endure your pity. I do not pity you, Manorama. I love you! Dev! And will always love you. When I saw you off in your bridal palanquin, I loved you then. When I took the thorn out of your foot, I loved you then too.. And today as well, now too.. Aren't you ashamed to talk like this? I trusted you. You have broken my trust. Don't ever show me your face again. Go away from this village. Listen to me, Manorama! - Your Manorama is dead! Our relationship is over as of today. Over! Babuii! - Get me a little poison from somewhere, my dear! Let me close my eyes, then you may walk over my dead body.. ...and do whatever you wish. Then I shan't come to stop you. I have done nothing to be ashamed of, Babuji! Nothing! How could you believe their words, babuji? I have done nothing, babuji, nothing. I have said what I had to say, my dear. Now it's up to you! Rama! Can I ask you something? Do you not love Dev? Mother! Tell me the truth. Don't you love him? You too, mother? - I know you better than you do yourself, Rama. I am your mother! The truth is that you love him. You know it yourself. But you don't accept it. Because he is poor, an orphan. And you are a Thakur's daughter.. ...brought up within the walls of this palatial house, ...who has been taught right from birth about.. ...religious customs, traditions rules, society, purity! And trapped within these high sounding words.. ...you yourself have come to believe.. ...that you have no right to be happy. How long will you turn away from the truth? I ask you when you think of Dev every waking moment of your life.. ...if this is not love, what is it? It is only love, my dear, only love! "Perhaps you are not destined for me." "Why do I wait for you?" "I was in love with you yesterday." "I love you even now." "Perhaps I have understood love today." "I love you today." "Yesterday, you waited for me." "Today, it is I who waits for you." "Perhaps you are not destined for me." "I wonder why my eyes" "wove these dreams around me." "I had asked you for but one happiness," "you did not give me even your sorrow," "you did not give me even your sorrow." "Life has become a burden for me now," "now I am neither dead nor alive." "I loved you yesterday too.." "I love you today as well." "Perhaps you are not destined for me." "May the bonds of love not break now," "may the bonds of love not break now," "I shall take care of these bonds now." "You will have pluck the thorns of unhappiness.." "..off my feet now as you did yesterday." "I hope I shall not come across these shadows.." "..of sadness I am afraid of.." "Yesterday, you waited for me.." "Today it is I who is waiting for you." "Today perhaps I have understood the meaning of love." "My heart is not under my control.." "I shall lose my life in your love.." "I am full of desire to meet you.." "My world is full of sadness." "My world is full of sadness." "Perhaps this is what they call love." "I am lost in myself all the time." "I remember you day and night." "I wait for you day and night." "Perhaps you are not destined for me." "Why do I continue to wait for you?" "I loved you yesterday too.." "I love you today as well." You have no truck with love and devotion, chhote babu. But when will you tire of philandering? Meaning? - You have the right to ruin those like me.. But you could spare at least one! What do you wish to say? That boy loves your daughter very much. Settle your daughter's life in happiness. Get her re-married to him. Who is that scoundrel? Tell me, or I shall kill you. Tell me! Hold your hand! Hold your hand! Wait a while. Chhote Thakur! What is this happening? Will you kill him? Tell your nephew, Pujari, that he leave this village immediately if he values his life. You have given me your punishment, chhote Thakur. Won't you tell me my crime? Of course, I shall tell you. So that the whole village can understand what happens to someone who plays with the honour of a Thakur's daughter. You are lying, Thakur. You have not come here for your daughter's honour. You have come here to simply establish your false pride and honour before the world. Deodhar! When the whole world calls her a widow and turns away from her.. ...you do not lose your honour then. But when I desired just a little honour for her, was your honour hurt? Do you even know which dark corner of your house she lies in? And how she lives? However she lives, that is our personal affair. This is not your personal affair, Thakur. Because these inhuman customs originate from your noble households. And by becoming established as custom and tradition.. ...they spread like a canker throughout the society. Shamsher, tie him to the jeep, drag him out of the village.. ...and throw him out. Only when he becomes a cripple will he realize.. The consequences of denigrating our customs and traditions. Enough of this, Chhote Thakur. With what face are you talking today of customs and traditions? That day when your daughter, Rama's horoscope was to be matched.. ...then you, for the sake of your own convenience, broke.. ...every custom and tradition.. ...to force me to commit the sin of making out a false horoscope. Did you make a false horoscope, Pujari? He compelled me to do it, Sarpanchji. Well, chhote Thakur, is he telling the truth? Why don't you speak? We will decide this at the Panchayat. Come, Vikram. At least now change your rotten customs and traditions, Thakur. Times are fast changing. You can't stop this process of change with your powerless hands. You can't stop it. You slut! I'll cut you into bits if you so much as step out of this room. What happened? What has she done? What has she done? She has brought us dishonour by dallying with this two-bit boy. I have only flayed him alive up til now, that Deodhar! Deodhar! - Deodhar's? And she is asking me what she has done. Today, I had to exchange words with the lowly for the sake of this fool. Yes, how can the lowly lock tongues with you? You cannot even drink the water touched by the lowly. But their women will do for you. They can share their beds with you. Stop this nonsense! Till today, you have not been able to resist either women or wine. But when my daughter seeks a little happiness, it seems like poison to you? When she used to cry all night, the whole village was happy. The moment she smiled a little, the whole village is heart-stricken. If I died today, you will not even wait until the morrow. You will wed another with pomp and ceremony. You'll throw a party, have liquor.. Call the nautch-girls and make them dance. Because you are a man. The woman's crime is that she is a woman. I pray to God that there be.. ...no girl born into your Thakur family for the next seven generations. Otherwise you will hound them to death in this manner. Raja Saab! - You? How is it you are here so suddenly? I had called him. To take away Rama. May I ask why? Do you need to ask even now? Come! Please make yourself comfortable. Pack up Rama's things. Raja Saab has come to take her away. Please come! Mother! Jethji! She will die, jethji, she will not survive. Dev is a good boy. He loves Rama very much. Rama loves him too. Why shouldn't we get them married? Bahu, you are not in your senses now. Please go away. You are not even mindful of the fact that you are a.. ...daughter-in-law of the Thakur family. You are saying this only because you are the girl's mother. Yes, I am the unfortunate girl's mother. But Jethji, is she nothing to you? And Dev has declared before the whole.. ...village that he will marry Rama. How dare he? He has the nerve to do this? Is there anyone? Watchman! Watchman! Call Kishenlal immediately. I have been holding a snake to my bosom. But if I can feed it I can also crush its head. Yes, he is weak, he is small in station. Kill him off. Because he has tried to breathe life into the dying embers.. ...of my daughter's life. But I ask you, what are you going to do about the man.. who has dishonoured your innocent daughter. Bahu! - Yes, I am asking you what you have done to the.. ...Veerendra Pratap Singh who dishonoured your daughter. You are treating him like an honoured guest in your house.. ...because he is a big man. You can do him no harm, none! Send her back to that butcher, Veerendra Pratap. Give her into his custody. Even if he tears her apart piece by piece. Listen to me..anger will only induce hatred. Whatever you do do it after careful thought and consideration. Why? Aren't they satisfied with what they have done? Do they want to kill him? Go tell them he will not come. Never! Wait Kishenlal. I am coming. - Now where are you off to, Dev? To meet Bade Thakur. Oh God! When darkness falls at the very utterance of someone's name.. ...it is inauspicious to set foot in his house. Don't go! - What are you saying? Lights go on and off even in cities nowadays quite often. And this is a village.. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Come Deodhar. I am sitting right here. My respects! Bade Raja, why are you sitting in darkness? I wish to speak to you. It is good it has become dark on its own. Sit down! Is it true whatever I have heard of between Rama and you? Yes, I love Manorama. When you know that she is a widow? The first time I returned to the village from the city.. ...I had touched your feet. Not just because you were elderly. But because I realized your greatness. That day, you were asking Maito.. ...to get his widowed daughter married off again. That was another matter, Deodhar. We are leading a double life. One life for others, another for ourselves. This is just a pretence. But in our families, widows do not re-marry. Shall I take my leave of you, then? - Sit down. I have not finished what I have to say. It goes without saying that we cannot allow Rama to re-marry. Hence, I will give you a piece of advice. Run away with Rama. Bade Raja Thakur! - Yes, Deodhar. I will curse the innocent girl.. ...that she has brought dishonour to the family and run away ...and thus will be able to save my own face. You don't have to worry. I will make all arrangements for you to leave. Just make sure that no one comes to know of this. No, Raja Thakur. No one will come to know of this. But I will not run away with Manorama. Yes, Bade Raja Thakur! Because this is not just a question of the life of one Dev or Rama. This is a battle against centuries of faulty customs.. ...and traditions which has spread like a canker in our society. If Rama wears a bridal dress, it will be with your blessings. You will see her off yourself in her bridal palanquin. Only then will she go. - Deodhar! This is a war of righteousness, Raja Thakur. There can be no compromise in this. Either it will be a complete defeat.. ...or a total success. I shall take my leave of you now. Pray God that you succeed and I fail! How can you talk like this, Chhote Raja Thakur. How can he dare to play with the honour of my family. No, it is not like that. I fear the entire village is with that swine Deodhar. Give up worrying about that. Leave alone the village, even if God himself wants to save him.. ...he will not be able to save him from certain death. I have made all arrangements. This very night, his body will be cut into so many bits.. ...that even the crows and.. ...vultures will not be able to distinguish between them. Dev! Dev! Manorama! You! At this hour? Dev, you love me very much, don't you? Tell me. Even if I have hurt your feelings a lot, the truth is that.. ...I love you very much. I love you too, Dev! I love you very much. But how unfortunate I am. When I came to know of it, it was so late. I beseech you in the name of this very love, Dev.. ...leave this village and go away. What are you saying? I have heard it with my own ears, Dev! They will kill you. Go away from here, before they reach you. No, Manorama, I will not leave you here alone and go away. Don't worry about me, Dev! I am already destroyed. First I got married. Then I was widowed. You know all this. But you do not know that after this, I was dishonoured. Manu! One does not offer stale flowers to the Gods, Dev. I am no longer worthy of you. What do you think? That this is reason enough to kill my love? Who is asking you to kill your love? But heed my words. Return to the city. I will return to the city. But after marrying you. Not before that. All right! All right! I accept your stubborn resolve. Look, I have become a bride. What have you done, Manorama? I have accepted you as my husband. Now I beg you to safeguard my status. Return to the city. Manu! My heart, body and mind are all yours, Dev! Heed my words! Look, I have become a widow once. Don't make me a widow all over again. Hey, that is Rama bitiya! Stop it. Hold your hand! Please stop it. Take these hired goons away. And throw them at the doorstep of the Thakurs. Let them understand that the villagers.. ...will no longer endure the atrocities of the Thakurs. That is all very well. But friends, you did not do well in beating up the Thakur's men. My dear girl, forgive us! Go back to your house. It is not right to put the villagers into trouble on our account. We will go away from this village right now. How many villages and towns will you change, auntie? By changing locations, these rotten customs will not change. Caste, creed, high, low, these distinctions will not be erased. Someone or the other will have to fight this battle. Villagers, I have no personal enmity towards you. It is only against this scoundrel. Who, having lived off our charity in the city, has forgotten his own position. Or this slut, who, despite being forbidden to set foot outside.. ...her room, has come here. Mind your tongue, chhote Thakur! Rama is no longer you daughter. She is my wife. You have no right to abuse her. You slut! You have spat on my face by forging a relationship.. ...with this orphan from a lowly and poor family. You have spat on my face. I will kill you first. Well done, Thakur! By killing an innocent woman, you.. ...are setting yourself up to be an upholder of moral values. Go and look into your own self. Have you spared any girl in this village? You made everyone who took your fancy shed her clothes before you. If you had your way, you would not spare your own daughter. You murderer! Stop shedding innocent blood. Your fight is with me, isn't it? Take me and avenge yourself. Shamsher, take both of them and set fire to them in the.. ...middle of the village square. So that the whole village can see that.. That the Thakur's justice does not spare even his own kin. What are you saying, chhote Thakur? Even if you do not accept your daughter as your own.. ...she is a daughter-in-law of our house, she is our honour. If you have to kill someone, kill that person who is the cause.. ...of this entire battle. Now it will be exactly as I have decided. Chhote Thakur! Chhote Thakur! Thakur. My men have surrounded your hirelings.. ...if anything should happen to our daughter-in-law.. ...it will be the death of you and your men. You had called me to take Rama away.. ...and I shall take her away at whatever cost. Veerendra Pratap! Abuji! Shoot these hired goons of the Thakur. Let me go! Don't you dare touch me. Help me, Dev! Save me! This is the demon who dishonoured me. Shoot this scoundrel! Villagers! Pounce on these men! Let no one escape alive. Babuji! Babuji! You scum! Do you dare to raise your hand on the Thakurs...? Oh God! Raja, you? Veerendra Pratap! Even God cannot forgive you for your crime.. ...of not looking at the elder daughter-in-law as a mother.. ...and the younger as a sister. There is no blame attached to killing such a person. Deodhar! Deodhar! My son! I wish my eyes had opened to reality in time. Brothers! Deodhar was right! These stupid and dirty customs start with our noble houses. All this is the result of that. And since I am a part of all that myself.. ...the law will certainly punish me. Bade babuji, no! No, my dear, everything will be all right. Come, my son. Take care of her. Deodhar, you have won and I have lost!
