MegaboxJoongAng PLUS M presents A SEE AT FILM CO.,LTD. Production Do you know what makes the people angry the most? That's when you're betrayed by someone you trusted. THIS FILM WAS INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS AND PEOPLE, BUT IT IS A WORK OF FICTION We got 5 chickens at home. 2 roosters, and 3 hens. But they haven't laid any eggs in days. My one joy in life is to fry up an egg for breakfast. You listening? Keep talking. So for the past 3 days I kept watch by the coop. At 4AM, I caught a guy red-handed, sneaking in. Know who it was? My neighbor, Chang-shik. But that scoundrel, he denied everything. Can you believe it? He said he came at 4AM to give my chickens some food. Then you should go to the village foreman, not me. No way. Chang-shik is the foreman's cousin's son. People just blamed me for accusing an innocent man. Now my hens cry each night like they lost their children. I can't sleep. What's this? Tie bits of string to your chickens' legs. Then late at night, put one of your hens in Chang-shik's coop. In the morning call all the villagers over to his place. "Now it's not just eggs, he stole my hen!" When he denies it, say you tied a red string on all your hen's legs. Not even the foreman's grandfather could save him then. But can I really do that? He only took a few eggs. It's a cruel tactic. Or, you can just live your life as a pushover. But Mr. Pharmacist, what are you writing there? I told you not to call me that. The pharmacy is just a temporary job. Gentlemen! In order to secure proper rights and status for yourselves, The democratization of this country... there are times to negotiate, and times... Shut up! KIM Woon-bum, you commie! ...and times when you must fight. If industrialists negotiate in good conscience, 1961, Inje County, Gangwon Province - Eat this, you commie! - and promote transparency... Sir, how could you? - Don't listen to him! - Take this man away. It's all lies! Let him be. Just let him be. He said leave me alone! All of us, in any situation, have the right to speak. I respect this man's words. And what he says is correct! You mustn't elect a communist! But sir, why do you think I'm a communist? You're running to hand over our country to the North! Sir, as for me. During the war, the Northern army threw me in Mokpo Prison, and I just barely escaped the firing squad. A communist who was nearly executed by the North Koreans? If I'm a communist, I'm a pretty stupid one. To KIM Woon-bum I've come to see Mr. KIM Woon-bum. He's gone out. I see. - When will he...? - I don't know. Can I wait until... - Yes. - All right. Hello. Hi. Welcome back. Hello. What's our plan for tomorrow? At 7AM you'll stop by the community center. Greet the village elders. At 9AM there's a presentation on self-governing councils. At 3PM there's a rice wine gathering at the... If you keep using such outdated tactics you'll lose the next election too! You've lost 4 times in 7 years, don't you get it? What the hell? Sorry, he came looking for Mr. KIM... Your campaign policies and promises are all fine, but to people who struggle to put food on the table, it all sounds like bullshit. Who does he think he is? Who are you? Pleased to meet you. I'm SEO Chang-dae. All right. Chang-dae. What am I doing wrong? Look at the Freedom Party, how efficient they are! You expound on 10 different issues, and they reply "com-mu-nist", just three syllables! What? Are you the man who sent me a letter? Yes. For the cost of one vote, I'll make the other side lose 10. I thought you could use such capitalist thinking. Look here, we're politicians, not merchants! Earning votes or earning money, what's the difference? It's different. The goal of a merchant can be to earn money, but the goal of a politician shouldn't be to earn votes. Last time, the election board didn't even let you register as a candidate. To fight people covered in shit, you need to get dirty. A nation where politicians fling shit is nothing but a toilet. In ancient times, Aristotle from Greece said this. Justice forms the order of society. Plato said for a just cause, any means can be considered. And Plato was Aristotle's teacher. Plato? Damn. How could he say that? So what's your proposal? I want to work with you. Oh damn. As you see, I can't afford another salary. I don't need a salary! I'm a labor activist after all. Take care. I'm from the North, but I lost my accent. Other people try for years and fail, but seeing my father killed for sounding like a commie made it easy! - Sure, you've had it hard. - Wait! Let's go have a smoke. I want to change this damned world! Stop it! In your letter, what was that flower? People call it "baby's poop." It's both poison, and antidote. Please use me. - You some kind of pharmacist? - No. Well, yes. But the pharmacy is just temporary. I am... KINGMAKER May 13, 1961: First victory in Inje by-election November 26, 1963 KIM won again in the 6th National Assembly election KIM declares the end of dictatorship April 28, 1967 Tight race for Mokpo Nat'l Assembly Seat KIM vs. KIM Byung As we speak, gangs abetted by the Republican Party 1967, Mokpo City, Jeolla Province are wielding violence to intimidate and assault supporters of the opposition, ranging about like roughnecks! The Mokpo police, civil servants and even the mayor are campaigning for my defeat. The Republicans' puppet KIM Byung has made me the target of an operation to wipe me out. Why? Because he's scared of me! Today, I'm issuing a public question to President PARK. Do you really plan to amend the constitution and run for a 3rd term? What a politician! Vaulting over KIM Byung to aim at the president. Even bringing up the constitution. It's visionary. If he's so visionary, why treat you that way? Even kings give prized retainers some kind of employment. This is like exile. Exile? He's given me time off to recover my health. Who got him that representative's badge? He should at least make you an aide. It's not the right time! If I take an official position, it'll give those scoundrels a target. Which scoundrels? So will KIM Young-ho and KIM Woon-bum join the National Assembly? What did Mr. President say? We can give the opposition 10 or 20 seats, but not those two! Realistically, it'll be hard to stop KIM Young-ho. Don't say it'll be hard in front of Mr. President! How hard for him to listen to such drivel! KIM Young-ho is the New Democrats' floor leader, and swinging an election in Busan is too expensive. What about KIM Woon-bum? We're focusing our ammunition on him. Don't make it too obvious. Obvious is okay! But Mr. President. KIM Young-ho is one thing, but do we really have to worry about KIM Woon-bum? Hey, Colonel Chun! Don't interrupt the adults in the room. And you, why discourage the lad? Tell us your thoughts. If we spend so much to beat a second-tier local newbie, it makes us look weak in the eyes of the public. That's why they treat you like a kid! Who here sees KIM Woon-bum as a second-tier local newbie? That's right. More than anything, that guy talks too much. Today... Remember that last Assembly, when he did his filibuster thing? You know how long he went on mocking us, without even a script? 5 hours and 19 minutes! If he stays in the National Assembly, he'll be a huge headache for us. He's a threat to me? No Mr. President, that's not what I meant. Of course he is. You see what's going on. Here! The revolution I started is not yet complete. Are we going to let some idealist fools stand in my way? No, Mr. President! Gentlemen, come with me to Mokpo. President Park, ahead of the National Assembly elections, received an enthusiastic welcome from the citizens of Mokpo. I will take personal responsibility for developing Mokpo's economy. President's Address To Mokpo Citizens I'll rebuild the rusting port, and found a new university. Dear citizens of Mokpo, trust in me, and cast your vote for nominee KIM Byung. Nominee KIM Byung, who had been in 2nd place, has received a boost from the President's unprecedented visit, upsetting the race with his gains in popularity. Today the President held a cabinet meeting in Mokpo. - It's a first for a regional city... - I'll be damned. What the hell is that? They moved the whole government down to Mokpo. At the cabinet meeting... Once he returns to Seoul, all this will die down. Every crisis is an opportunity, and the attention may help us. After this cabinet meeting, the whole nation's eyes are on Mokpo. Right, since we have the youth vote... Don't strain yourselves trying to lift the mood. Your writing is really good. But it can be shorter. A speech is more powerful if it's short and concise. I see. Who do we have here? You're back. How have you been? It's him, right? The one who got Mr. KIM elected twice? Busan Girl. Work on the speech. Who could think that damned pharmacist elected anyone? Don't start again. Go on! Give the kid a break. They say he got time off for his health, but really it was more like probation. Why? Did something happen? A lot happened. He'd sell his own parents' gravestones in order to win. Did you hear that rumor? Last election, about Republican CHOI Mun-sik's secret child. Yes, I remember. That dirty rumor was SEO's doing. But CHOI held a press conference and denied everything. It's a dirty rumor! That's not my son! Sure. That's exactly what SEO wanted. He needed the image of CHOI denying the rumor in front of everyone. He said it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I still don't agree with your methods. I knew you'd call on me again sometime. But still... I'm not a jar of fruit that you can taste at your leisure. You remember what you said when we first met? You want to change the world. A world where innocent people aren't persecuted as communists, where you can speak without fear, where the nation doesn't force sacrifice on its people. Creating such a world is my biggest goal. You need to win in order to realize that goal. I really want to experience that world you speak of. But I can no longer be your fruit jar. I want to be more. That'll be hard right now. But when you're ready, it will surely happen. So, are you with me? But many of them out there object strongly to your methods. For our remaining time, I, SEO Chang-dae will help with the campaign. Don't deny your flaws, tackle them head on. Some of you already know me, and some may want to curse when hearing what I've done. But we're not here for a friendly game of cards, are we? Life is hard enough as it is, so why are we all here? You there. What's your answer? Well, we're here to help Mr. KIM get elected. No. No, no, no. For any organization to work, each member needs agency. We're not here for KIM Woon-bum. Everyone needs to feel some ownership. Let's not underestimate ourselves here. Like KIM Woon-bum, we want to fight the Republicans! We're not here for KIM Woon-bum, but to use KIM Woon-bum as a weapon in a brawl with those rotten scoundrels, right? I agree! He's right, isn't he? But the problem is, this isn't a clean fight. You all know the Republicans are passing out cash and gifts? Their liquor is raining over Mokpo, and their feasts create mountains. And is that all? During the last election, there was a blackout during the vote count. What? Is there a blackout? You know what that means? The government's inspectors switched all the ballots! Dirty scoundrels! Listen up! There's a robber with a knife. Should we fight him with our bare hands? We have a right to self-defense. We need something! I'm at least going to give you a rolling pin. If you think that's too vile and cheap, let's just give up. Let's drink the Republicans' booze and go to sleep. You know what words I hate the most? "We lost but we put up a good fight." Whatever it takes, I'm going to make KIM win. And when he wins, then I...! Then all of us win! What do you think? I'm going to fight! - Let's beat those scumbags! - Let's do it together! KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! He's good. Talented at that, too... Hey, SEO! What is all this? I ordered 100 in total. Pick out some of the smarter volunteers and pass them out. But they're volunteering for the Republicans, not the New Democrats. Republican Party Send out people in pairs to visit tenant farmers. Many of them just vote for whoever their village head tells them to, so we'll target that. Who's the village head? It's the Republicans, fishing for votes. God, the smell out here... Vote for KIM Byung, okay? We don't care about voting, so go back where you came from. Then at least don't vote for KIM Woon-bum! Is there a bug up your ass? Why are you so rude? This goddamned cow shit! What happened to your faces? That's none of your business. Are you for KIM Byung or KIM Woon-bum? Well, KIM Woon-bum has done a good job for us. I'm for KIM Woon-bum. Didn't you hear the President? If KIM Byung wins, we get a new port. Sure enough, the dad's wiser than the son! Here, have a smoke. Wait! What brand do you smoke? Arirang. What a patriot! Hand out Arirang to them. This is the brand U.S. soldiers smoke. You smoke this one. Let's see here. Remember, KIM Byung! People like KIM Woon-bum who speak well are all commies. He never graduated university. What a world we live in. These uneducated peasants pretending to be high class. Hey, watch your mouth. You Republicans... Cut! Who will look at you if you speak so quietly? Anyone got a bit more spirit? Hey you scumbag asshole shitheads! Cut! Without swearing. Look here, you! What kind of crap is that? You think I don't know what you Republicans are scheming? You wanna take down KIM Woon-bum before he becomes president? Hey everyone, you know what? If KIM Woon-bum wins, Mokpo might even get its own President... What are you people doing? Comrade! Hey, run! Comrade! Are you okay? I think I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding! Look, it's blood! Blood! Red blood! Those Republican thugs drew blood and ran off! Damn Republican thugs! Dirty scoundrels! Republican Party Feast, 8PM Instead of doing her work, she's posting these around town. It's a feast for village elders, held in the Republicans' name. Don't worry about that. Since there won't be any feast, it won't cost us any money. But the village elders will be furious at Republicans. Wow, how crude. Did you learn this in North Korea? I guess in the South, things that work are called crude. Are these all the rubber shoes we have? Oh gosh. We barely covered these with campaign donations. The Republicans are giving out dress shirts with the shoes. And sugar with the flour. All this pretending to be Republicans is making us poor. Our pharmacist is great at cooking up schemes. But I guess you don't check the ledger. Hey, eat your dinner! No! What is it now? I give him 10 won for each multiplication table he learns. Today he did the 9 tables, so he's done. Then did you give him 90 won? No. I took back all the coins I'd given him. He learned his tables and I have my money, win-win. What a cruel woman you are. Oh my, it's the Republicans! What brings you here? You received something from us yesterday, right? Yes, we got a dress shirt and rubber shoes. We're going to have to take those back. There was a mistake. Those shouldn't have gone out. Take them back! We'll take back the Republicans' gifts in their own name. Good day. Dress shirts, rubber shoes, sugar and flour... They'll be madder than if they never received anything. Flour goes over there. Two bags... You scoundrel! How can you take it back? Bastards, why'd you hand them out in the first place! Did I ask for those? Did I? Republican bastards, don't dare campaign in Mokpo! Nice work... nice work. Republican Party Yeah, nice work... New Democratic Party New Democratic Party This is from the New Democrats. You know how much cash we put into Mokpo? Then why aren't the polls going up? Mr. President made a personal visit! You were a government minister, how will it look if you lose? I don't know what to say. From what I hear, KIM Woon-bum is handing out gifts, too. Any idea who's funding them? That can't be. They're stone broke. How can they be buying gifts? So my people are giving me false reports? My apologies. The upcoming speech is your last chance. Get proof that KIM Woon-bum handed out gifts, and use that as ammunition, okay? That he's no different from the rest of us. Minna dorobodesu. (They're all crooks) For the sake of Mokpo's revival, don't keep voting for the opposition! Realistically, KIM Woon-bum lacks the money and power to develop Mokpo. I admit that KIM Woon-bum is a good representative. Young, with the integrity to confront injustice. At least that's what I thought. But ladies and gentlemen, do you see this? The New Democrats are using these dirty bribes to buy votes! Even as they criticize us and pretend to be pure, they go around passing out gifts! KIM Woon-bum, if you have any self-respect, admit your hypocrisy and apologize to Mokpo's citizens! Effective my ass! That damned Northerner. Please vote for me, KIM Byung. Thank you. KIM Byung! KIM Byung! When KIM Byung took these shoes and dress shirt and waved them around, I thought it was some kind of sales pitch. KIM, who has the backing of the President, accused the New Democrats and I of lacking money and power. Then he says we're passing out gifts. Isn't that a contradiction? - Just apologize! - However... If these gifts really belong to the New Democratic party, then I will apologize to KIM Byung. But if for the sake of penniless me, in the face of our era's fear and oppression, there are people spending their own money to pass these out, then I don't know how to thank the good citizens of Mokpo. But Mr. KIM Byung. You say the Republicans caught the New Democrats passing out gifts. Isn't that like the robbers catching the cops? My dear, respected citizens of Mokpo. I will dedicate my life fighting to protect democracy in this nation. If I should die in this fight, before you put flowers on my body, please continue battling to uproot these rigged elections. Otherwise, even while dead I won't be able to shut my eyes. I speak to Yudal Mountain, to the flowing Youngsan River, and to Samhak Island. Yudal Mountain! If you have a soul... Samhak Island, if you have spirit... Youngsan River, if you have consciousness... This nation's government has made a target of me, so I appeal to you, please protect me from the Park regime's poisoned knife. KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! Results are in for the National Assembly, Mokpo district. With 52,017 ballots cast, Republican KIM Byung received 22,738 votes, and New Democrat KIM Woon-bum received 29,279 votes. The winner of the 1967 election, Mokpo district is KIM Woon-bum. Hey. Hey! Don't touch that. You know how hard it was for our boys to find you? You've got no title. What are you? We invented a nickname for you. The Shadow. My hard work was worth it. Such a great nickname. A sad nickname. You did so much, but no one knows it. I'm a total fan of yours, you know? Your methods are criminally vile, I'm impressed! I don't break the law by vote rigging or abuse of power, like some. Or is it illegal to be as smart as me? Wow, meeting you in person, you're shameless. Fearless, too. We're not here to scare you. Make yourself a nameplate and work in a sunny office. You'll be working for the most powerful man in Korea. Give me some time to think. We can't wait too long. How long? A week? 3 seconds. I refuse. I'm picky about who I work for. You scum, who do you think you are? You've got a North Korean accent, too? Let's see if you still chatter with a hole in your face. Chief KIM, that's enough. Are you ordering me? How could I? This is a private home. Wow! My mistake. Secretary LEE. My damn mistake! Pardon me all to hell. Wow, our President is amazing. Pitting two subordinates like you against each other. But be careful. Being fired by a boss like that won't be nice. Is your boss any different? Much different. I'm envious. Of your boss. You can't buy such loyalty from your followers. But if KIM Woon-bum keeps being called a communist, can he properly groom a person from the North? And your work isn't something you can announce to the world. If you change your mind, call me. Mr. Shadow. Daehan News On September 14, the Republicans' proposed constitutional amendment - Presidential Term Limit Extended to extend presidential term limits to 12 years was passed. Just serve for life, you tyrant! Tyrant? Want to get arrested? As long as he's doing a good job! Now, the sports. I can’t see! You're seeing a game between Korea and the Singapore national team. 1969, Seoul From the opening minutes, the game was neck-and-neck. Go Korea! With Singapore pulling ahead until the 19th minute... Yeah, nice shot! Did you hear Chief KIM was fired? After how high he flew? He deserves it. He's been so vicious. He was in charge of the amendment. Now it's been passed, he's no longer needed. And they probably needed a bone to toss to the opposition. You pick things up fast, Su-yeon. That fermented fish is no joke. Is that...? Leave me some gills. Representative KIM Young-ho, right? He's so good looking. Don't act like a schoolgirl. He's just a politician. What do you mean? He's like a hero in these parts. Right, the youngest representative, the youngest floor leader ever. And that's Representative LEE Han-sang! Right. Look at that! Why are all the big shots gathering here? They're not part of our group, and things have been turbulent lately. Interesting. Those three men, meeting without party leader KANG. KANG In-san... Based on experience, KANG would be the #1 presidential candidate. Of course party leader KIM Young-ho is #2. And #3 I guess is LEE Han-sang. Why are these two men visiting a minority politician like Mr. KIM? Let's think about it in reverse. If I were the Republicans? I'd probably be most comfortable with KANG. Feels pretty odd to be sitting here on your turf. Please make yourself comfortable. I didn't say I was uncomfortable. Right, why should a top dog feel uncomfortable? Secretary LEE, the opposition leader is hardly a top dog. Who knows, you might be president someday. Don't sound me out, just tell me what you want. Sir. In next year's election, please run against the President. We haven't picked our candidate yet. A contest for the nation's top job should be fought by adults. Not a bunch of kids. It's a bad look for the people. By kid, you must mean KIM Young-ho? KIM Young-ho... or LEE Han-sang... Those are my kids. I didn't bring them up to betray their elders. With the opposition losing its way, KIM Young-ho Announces Presidential Run November 1969 we need a new push to revive democracy. At this crucial moment, motivated by a sense of duty and sacrifice, I announce to my fellow party members and the public my firm intention to enter the 1971 presidential election! KIM Young-ho has got courage. He really is a natural at this. Did you just lose your chance to run? Whether that's courage or recklessness, we have to see. We don't know how KANG will respond. KIM Young-ho is not ready for this, as he himself must know. Having a novice like him run for president will make a shambles of the opposition! Wow, the old man is pretty worked up. KIM Young-ho miscalculated. It'll be hard to recover. If LEE Han-sang and you join him, it's a different story. What are you talking about? Did you three make an agreement that day? We three people in our 40s, let's shake things up! I've got a mind to run for president. If you run, then so will I. But aren't you two KANG's people? Don't be ridiculous. KANG's a Republican lapdog. Three drums make more noise than two. For the 40s faction to succeed, you should run too, and we'll make a united front. My friend, aren't we making a democracy? Democracy my ass! He's just inviting you to his party. The "40s Faction" would make a good headline. You don't seem to know national politics, but even if we succeed, it only helps KIM Young-ho. Right. He's at the party's center. We can't win that fight. We'll never win by avoiding a fight. It's not avoidance, it's building up for the next fight. The nomination isn't a popular vote, it's an internal fight for power. I know we're at a disadvantage. But you and I are paid to find a way to win. Let's imagine we're for KIM Young-ho. If KIM Woon-bum runs, what will we say? Thanks for being a cog in my victory! I think Secretary PARK's right. - Of course. - But... the future is something we all make together. Hey, if we run, KIM Young-ho gets nominated! But... would that be so bad? Like us, KIM Young-ho has long fought against dictatorship. I'd be the better choice... Our party must nominate someone young and ambitious KIM Woon-bum Announces Presidential Run January 1970 who has developed good blueprints for reform. Therefore I intend to run, to restore hope and courage to a despairing public. February 1970 LEE Han-sang Announces Presidential Run The 40s Faction Emerges in a Three-Way Race Honey, did you hear about the foreman? What about him? The village foreman has 3 sons. But all 3 sons are running to replace him as foreman! Then what about the foreman? What do you think? He's sick in bed. Those ungrateful kids! Ungrateful? Our foreman is the governor's lapdog. Lapdog! Is it really true? Isn't it obvious? If you're not a public administrator or a cop, who wears a mustache? That's right. Rather than a tired old man, we're better off with one of his sons. We are! We are! About 70% of district party chairmen are for KIM Young-ho or LEE. KIM Young-ho KIM Woon-bum LEE Han-sang The numbers don't look good. There are times when emotion matters more than numbers. I came to a similar conclusion. While they fight inside, we will go outside. The less factional delegates who feel ignored by the center, we'll visit them in person. Train Tickets Hello ma'am! Let me take that. How could you come all the way up here? I'd climb Mt. Baekdu if I had to. Oh my. Are you hot? Come in. Hey! Sir! Sir! Over here! Please, vote for Candidate #2. How do you do? I'm here for Candidate KIM Woon-bum... Gyeonggi Province 50 We're more concerned with ordinary delegates than district chairmen. So please support... That's checkmate. Chungcheong Province 34 Hello? Yes! Gangwon Province 27 4 from Masan, 7 from Ulsan, and 12 from Busan. That's 23 in total. Wow, he's even popular in Gyeongsang! It's a three-way fight. KIM Young-ho and LEE Han-sang will split the vote. If we keep accumulating votes one by one, we have a chance. You could've called, why come in person? If I'd called, you'd say I have no manners. Then let's have a good-mannered talk. Sir. Isn't it better for me to save face for you? I'll support your right to choose the nominee. And you want me to pick you? You think of me as a back room deal maker now. The politics of compromise won't change anything. That's why you call me a lapdog? Then let me ask you as your junior. Why do the Republicans want to compete with you? Well? Take the right of nomination and step aside. I'll protect your position as party leader. You don't get how to negotiate, do you? I'm already party leader, so I've nothing to gain. Not the minority leader, but the majority leader. I'm going to become South Korea's 7th President. Hello! Why'd you want to meet here? People could misunderstand. This is better than meeting in secret. Make it quick. Next week, LEE Han-sang is going to pull out. It's the party leader's doing. We'll support KIM Young-ho. What about LEE Han-sang? You can't do this to me! After you guys ganged up on me? I can't do this to you? Pull out and I'll make you floor leader. It's the most I can offer. Sir, I have my own followers. If it's you vs. me and KIM Young-ho, will they still follow you? No one can beat those two. If KIM Woon-bum backs out, surely he'll get some apportioned seats. Shouldn't you have your own representative's badge? If we back out and get the apportioned seats, we'll be stronger for the next election in 5 years. If LEE Han-sang is out, it's 2 to 1. 3 to 1 if you include KANG. Our only chance is to persuade LEE Han-sang to join us. Why would a player like Lee Han-sang do that? I can't believe this. KIM Young-ho is outmaneuvering everyone. Sir, if you withdraw too late, you'll lose the apportioned seats. Secretary PARK is right. How encouraging. But what can I do? Even if I lose, I'm in it until the end. You're not hoping for a seat, are you? That's not it, sir. Listen up. Putting ambition before integrity will get you nowhere. Even if we lose, we'll preserve our integrity. And if we win, I'll be the first to give you that seat. We just need to win, what's the worry? That's right. Secretary PARK, if we win, you'll be Representative Park. Exactly. Mr. SEO, how about you try to convince him? He listens to you. After calling me a vulgar Northerner. You're all worked up. Worried about your seat. Hey! Don't start again! At times like these we need to band together! - Welcome, sir. - Hello. You've had a lot already. Yes, I drank a bit. Then before you're totally drunk, talk to me. What? You won't try persuading me to drop out? How could I persuade you? So there's something else on your mind. You remember, when I said I didn't want to be a fruit jar? Sure I do. I said you needed more time. Then does Secretary PARK need more time? Do you want a seat, too? I guess I don't qualify to even ask. At first, I wanted to follow KIM Woon-bum, who would change the world. When you won, it felt like I'd changed the world. But the funny thing is, the more you won, as I watched you, I wondered why no one knew me. I wanted to be like you someday. I know what you mean. No, you don't. A man like you will never know what it is to live in a shadow. How could you know how it feels to never show my face? On the Election to the 7th National Assembly I know they offered to make you floor leader. If you join me, I can offer you a bigger role. So if I endorse you for the presidential nomination, you'll support me for party leader? You see me as a lightweight after I dropped out. Why should I take that leap when the result is so obvious? Politics is a moving organism. If you just sit and tell fortunes, what kind of politics is that? Sir, don't be rude. Let's let them talk. Joining those who currently hold power is easy. But better outcomes can be found down rugged paths. But you're asking me to betray both the floor leader and party head. I may feel upset, but they're my political mentors and my comrades. What a pervert. Why did KIM Woon-bum hire such a...? What an earth... Huh? Hello? Is this Representative LEE Han-sang? Interesting name card. No name or title. Are you KIM Woon-bum's shadow? I don't like that nickname. "You can become party leader without betraying anyone." What does that mean? Just what it says. Without betraying KIM Young-ho, you can become party leader. Not sure why I should believe that. You're KIM Woon-bum's man. Don't believe in me, but my ambition. Your ambition to become more than just floor leader, and my ambition to lose the nickname Shadow is the same. That's more believable. Meet me and I'll tell you a foolproof plan, however... when you become party leader, I want a representative's seat. New Democratic Party Convention Welcome to the New Democratic Party Convention! Today we select the party's nominee for the 1971 presidential election via secret ballot. I'll go get some air. Not feeling well? Ballot Box Delegates, thank you for your votes. Now we will announce the results. KIM Young-ho! 421 votes! KIM Woon-bum! 382 votes! Please quiet down. Blank ballots, 78 votes! With neither candidate holding an absolute majority, a second round of voting will be held in 30 minutes. This round's invalid. Hey, LEE Han-sang! Hey, LEE Han-sang! Who cast the blank votes? Hey! Tell your supporters to cast blank ballots. Then we go to a second round. If that happens, KIM Young-ho will panic. Your votes become more valuable. So make a deal for the party leadership? He's already promised that to KANG. In a crisis, verbal promises are often broken. He'd offer not just a deal, but his own heart. Representative LEE! How could you do this? Who made me quit in the first place? What is it that you want? Let's go someplace private. Where is that scoundrel LEE Han-sang? Sir. You go ahead. KIM Young-ho said he'll give you whatever you want. Words aren't enough. But the vote's about to start. I need a signed pledge that KIM will support me for party leader. You better move quick. Hey, LEE Han-sang! However backhanded a business politics may be, this is outrageous! Sir... And the same for KIM Young-ho! Sir, you misunderstand. Go tell KIM Young-ho. He has to choose between you and me as party leader. You bunch of damned novices! Sir! Sir! Representative LEE! If you want to be floor leader, vote for KIM Young-ho. I need to go talk to KANG. Sir! Sir! You bastard. You don't believe him, do you? You betrayed them once already. If they can't trust you, why make you floor leader? What? What are you scheming at? Vote for KIM Woon-bum. Wow. That was a nice effort. But nothing's changed. I'm less likely than ever to vote for him. This is a signed pledge from KIM Woon-bum. If I am nominated for president, at the next party assembly, I promise to support Lee Han-sang as party leader. I already turned this down. You think I'd accept it after all this? Then why'd you take the card? Don't overestimate curiosity. You think I'll be swindled by some nameless hack twice? You lost. The choice is yours. The second round of voting is over. Now we will announce the results. KIM Young-ho! By 46 votes, KIM Woon-bum has been chosen as the presidential nominee! KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! The stronger a light shines, the darker the shadow. But I like seeing you in the light. My gosh, you beat me good today. Congratulations. Thank you. KIM Woon-bum! KIM Woon-bum! My victory today is not an individual victory, but a victory for the New Democratic Party and 30 million citizens. Tell me. You remember what you said when we first met? You want to change the world. A world where innocent people aren't persecuted as communists, where you can speak without fear, where the nation doesn't force sacrifice on its people. Creating such a world is my biggest goal. At this moment, a new era is opening. The people must rule. It's time to create the age of the people. Freedom, prosperity and well-being! We will usher in the age of reunification! I will stand at the head of this new era, and fight for the people's freedom and happiness! When did I say that? Sir! Can I have a hug from the future president? You're drunk. Congratulations. Good work. Are you ready for this? What? To emerge from the shadows. After the presidential election is the general election. That would be a good time to realize your ambitions. Oh, I'm... Damn, you're not ready! No, no, I'm ready! I'm so ready, sir. We need to start a completely new era. This election will be a fight over policy and vision. You're ridiculously smart. You're a natural at reading a situation and winning. But what's important is not how to win, but why you have to win. Yes, I'll remember that. KIM Woon-bum can't do it. The people can do it. - Oh, Chief SEO. - Hello! You look sharp today. Are you ready for the trip to America? Yeah, we're talking to the embassy. SEO... I mean, Chief SEO, you're going, too? Yes. Sure enough, our king maker is special. In Washington we'll meet Secretary of State Rogers and Senator Kennedy. Wow, it's like a dream. And later, please help me out. Among us, the one who will go the farthest is... ...Secretary PARK. Mr. SEO. Yes? If you go to America, can you buy my son a present? Sure. I won't engage in one-sided attacks on the government. I have this image as a fighter, but I'm actually quite mild-mannered. Well, hearing you say that, let's move on to discuss policy. You propose to eliminate the homeland reserve forces. As for me, I don't see the sense in that. For a divided nation like ours to eliminate reserve forces, is that really sensible? That son of a bitch! Thank you for asking. The original purpose of the reserve forces was to protect against a North Korean invasion. This is being carried out by citizens. Using security as bait, the government puts citizens in the military to serve its own ends. We've moved quite far from its original purpose. Maintaining a policy after its purpose has changed, do you consider that sensible? Call the Secretary of Defense and get an estimate of the North's military power. North Korea has trained a million-man red militia, the same size as their standing army, plus 30,000 guerillas. KIM Woon-bum's plan to disband the reserve forces is a treasonous invitation to Kim Il-sung to invade! If KIM Woon-bum plays his pipe, Kim Il-sung dances! If Kim Il-sung strikes the drum, KIM Woon-bum matches his beat! Those bastards are stirring up security panic over my policy, but if we drop one policy for every foolish attack of theirs, what kind of reform is that? You know our people, just the word communist gives them nightmares. But caving in now makes us look weak. Professor KANG, you want us to keep being called pro-communist? That's right, the Republicans won't let go of this. Chief SEO, you're quiet. Yes, the policy itself is innovative and good. But it was announced too soon. We gave them time to hit back. It would've been better just before the vote. That's water under the bridge now. Hurry up and withdraw the policy. All the nation is angry about this. There's a way to deflect that anger. You all remember the acetate attack on KIM Young-ho last year? It's masterminded by central intelligence. They thought it would scare him off, but it didn't. The hand behind this dictatorship is central intelligence! This plot by the government to rub me out will not make me back down! You know how much his approval ratings went up? We need a similar incident. Are you suggesting we stage a show? Sometimes politicians need to stage a show. Don't take this sitting down, we'll fabricate some gossip... Representative PARK! If you want to stage a show, you should join the circus! If it's too soon to disband the reserve forces, then we can restructure it into a defense corps. Not just change the name, but reform the entire system. Even when it was established 3 years ago... Chief SEO. Yes? I don't think you're ready yet. I'd better take Secretary PARK with me to America. You stay at the party headquarters. 2nd day of KIM Woon-bum's US visit Last night during nominee KIM Woon-bum's trip to the U.S., a mysterious explosion occurred at his residence. His mother and nephew were both home at the time, but no injuries were reported. Nothing's been determined yet. We're still looking into it. All right. Where have you been? Come to the meeting room. I'll speak directly. Who did this? How could the police do it? Only central intelligence is capable. But you think they're so stupid? It's obvious what Mr. KIM will say. Then who is it? If not us, who would do such a thing? No, use stronger language here. This is a heinous act committed by central intelligence... Let me do it. Isn't that too strong for a statement? We don't even know who did it. It doesn't matter who did it, it matters what it looks like. What? Nothing. Confiscate everything! What's going on? Don’t miss one single thing. Not even one, got it? Put it down and step back please. What are you doing here? I said don’t touch it. Mr. SEO Chang-dae? - Get your hands off me! - They've taken him! In regard to the explosion at KIM Woon-bum's house, police are investigating KIM's own associates, and have taken them in for questioning. Suspecting a self-fabricated plot, police have zeroed in on lawmakers and staff members close to KIM. Keep SEO, and release the others after questioning. Yes, sir. Who do you think is behind the explosion? Did you complete your US itinerary? Please answer! Did you obtain good results in the U.S.? How do you feel? The police are fabricating this whole thing. They even dragged me in for questioning. And Chief SEO? They still have him. This is central intelligence's doing. Since I was meeting people in the U.S., they did this to bring me back. I'll fight them. You remember when SEO suggested staging a show? You suspect him? What's certain is, when the bomb went off, he wasn't at the office. Suspecting someone for being absent is to push a drowning man underwater. I'm just telling you the truth. Let's not all accuse each other. I'll know it when I meet him. This isn't for you to do. You expect me to just sit still? Don't act rashly! They took my man. He's not yours anymore. What? The election is soon, don't give them an advantage. - Because of that idiot... - He's my comrade! He's fought with me from the very beginning. Without finding out the truth, I can't let him go. I know how much you care about him. And how much he's done for you. But you need to understand your position right now. To end dictatorship and bring in democracy... That's what everyone here is fighting for. But I can't abandon him. Then instead of you, how about the party leader takes action, for all of us? You people are really something. Okay, I'll try talking to him. I read this with true admiration. I really like you. If you think it over, I'm sure we can both win. Someone needs to lose for winning to mean anything. All right, then. It's time for you to go home. What are you scheming at? We caught the culprit. The nominee's nephew, Jung-shik. He was playing around with gunpowder. He's in middle school, so he's at that age. You expect me to believe that? You sound like you know the real criminal. KANG just barely stopped them from pinning it on our camp. I'm curious how he did that. What deal did he make? It seems they were targeting you. In the future, whatever you do they'll respond in this way. So you want me to drop out? It seems they're uncomfortable with you. And our side feels the same. Then what am I supposed to do? I have to give up my seat, too? Last time too, I called you back again. No. That was completely different. Now, your dream... My dream is right in front of my eyes. This issue isn't something I can decide on my own. As the nominee, I speak for the party. I'm the one who got you there! What? You think you did it on your own? Don't I hold a share of your position? This position isn't something you divide up for profit. Don't let ambition sweep away your principles. It wasn't you or me who put me here. It was the people. Save those showy phrases for your speeches. The people? Who are they? They just believe, listen to, or do the things you tell them to. How can you be so arrogant? Who are these people anyway? It's just an illusion. Then who led the revolution in April 1960? Who risked their lives to resist Japanese colonial rule in 1919? And was the world changed? We still live in a dictatorship, and those former collaborators are still rich and powerful. The reason they can do that is the damned people! Then, how are we any different from them? They were wrong and we're right. That's the difference. Isn't that why we've been fighting? No. You're talking about a fight to win. With no greater cause, just us against them. Just because they're wrong doesn't mean we're right. If you care more about the means than the goal, you can justify dictatorship or even treason. It's not that you aren't ready, someone like you shouldn't do politics. Ever. Wow. Now the truth comes out. But you know what? You used me in order to win. I know. When the explosive went off, my mother and nephew were home. Did you do it? Yes. I did it. That's all I know how to do. In order to make the great, conscientious KIM Woon-bum president, this vulgar con man did the job. Thank you. I was feeling so bad about doing this, but now you made it easy for me to fire you. The students' revolution was on April 19! And the coup on May 16! Now on April 27, with the people's help, this nation for the first time in 5000 years will achieve a democratic revolution, by bringing about a peaceful change of government. And with the support of all of you rallied here today, I am going to win this presidential election! A million people gathered for KIM Woon-bum's speech! But you people expect me to believe that I'm winning? 520 billion won... That's the national budget for this year! How much are we spending on the election? About 70 billion won, sir. This wretched election is burning up 10% of the national budget. So who here can explain why we're losing? They've held power for too long. You know what I hear? Many people are tired of this long-term rule. There is also great support for your policies. We should contact the president and propose a joint event or televised debate. Don't accept that under any circumstance! Debating KIM Woon-bum will bring nothing but trouble. Let's use the media to argue his policies are too expensive. No. Then it becomes an election on policy, we'll lose. Secretary LEE, don't just diagnose, prescribe! Mr. President, your home region Gyeongsang is much bigger than KIM's. Stoke regional rivalry? How? - Shake things up, sir! - Thank you. Sir! Is it true you'll fire Gyeongsang civil servants if you get elected? That's ridiculous! He'll favor his own region! What did you say? I heard it! You Jeolla crook! All of you listen! He's a Jeolla stooge out to cut off all our benefits! Strange banners are appearing all throughout Gyeongsang Province. We're checking on it. What is all this? These are meant to look like they're supporting us. People of Jeolla, rise up! President only favors Gyeongsang! Break Gyeongsang's industrial monopolies! A Jeolla patriot doesn't buy Gyeongsang products! Busan, Ulsan, Daegu, Gumi, Changwon... Fury Towards Jeolla Grows in Gyeongsang Banners are being hung in every free spot in Gyeongsang. But the President is still not convinced. We're not a huge country like America. There's never been strong regional identification in Korean politics. Yes there is. You can see it right there. Since I've joined the loaded side, let's use our bullets. If any coward tries to run away, I'll wring the necks of even your neighbors. If the villains in TV dramas are all Jeolla residents, or if the news emphasizes criminals' Jeolla backgrounds, that will help. Crime Trio From Jeolla Jeolla vs. Gyeongsang sounds too obvious. Let's describe it as Silla vs. Baekje. Classical. It's not classical, it's ancient history. No. It'll still work. Old people love history. Return of the Three Kingdoms. Which of the three kingdoms united this country? Re-elect native son President PARK, the heir to Gyeongsang's old glory! Stoke Gyeongsang's sense of superiority If we don't elect a president from Gyeongsang, our region will become Where are you taking those trees? nothing more than a land of outcasts! Shh! We're hiding them. If Kim is elected, they'll move all these trees to Jeolla. Sir. Let's add more security for the speech in Gyeongsang. With the mood these days... Yes, please do that. By any chance, have you spoken with SEO recently? I'd go see him. These seem like his tactics... Leave the security as it is. Let's not make things more tense. Put in an editorial that a Jeolla president would concentrate investment there. We have one writer with a really sharp pen. KIM Woon-bum, a Curse on Gyeongsang's Economy Jeolla Spirit Boycott Goods from Jeolla Boycott Goods from Jeolla Did you hear the news, Mister CHOI? What news? There's a rumor they'll build a giant garbage dump in Jeolla. What a smell! Why build it here in Jeolla? Just hear me out! So in the end they decided to build it in Gyeongsang. Why take it away from us? Those damned Gyeongsang thieves! Wow, our nation's people are furious. But if they found out we did it, there could be a backlash. A raging bull only sees the red flag. It doesn't even think about who's waving it. These days there's a saying in Gyeongsang. Even the local fool votes local. The people are so creative. They're better than us. We've set the nation against itself, and who knows when this rift will end. Let's not clink glasses over it. Our people were divided North and South because of the war. All we did is extend the divide east and west. What? You're still awake? Sleep a bit at least. Tomorrow's a big day. What's wrong? Worried that you'll lose? No. We're going to win. A free vote, and a joyful election. In order to choose a true president for the people, the nation cast their votes. In the most orderly election in our 23-year history, the people's choice... and with 6,342,828 votes cast, President PARK of the Republicans won re-election. How much more are they going to pocket? I really thought KIM Woon-bum would win... Everyone from Gyeongsang voted for PARK! Even if entire Jeolla folks vote for KIM, there was no way to win over PARK! Personally I feel quite composed. But in this election, the people's wish for a peaceful change in leadership was stifled. With hopes extinguished of bringing about any future change of government through the ballot box, I cannot accept the results of this unlawful, fraudulent vote. Therefore I pledge before you now to uphold my beliefs and responsibility until my final days. Thank you. I added a bit more to what was promised. Did you vote? I guess not. Oh my, I was really curious who you'd vote for. All my ideas about justice were brought down by my own hand. Do I really need to put a stamp on it? Justice? The work you did for them was about justice? You changed positions but the work you did was the same. Still, that side had a cause. So romantic, all this talk of justice and causes. You should be a politician! But who says only one side has a cause? Just as you believed in KIM, I believe in our President. That is my justice. Doesn't the word justice usually belong to the victor? So a successful coup is called a revolution. We won, so... what we achieved is justice. We should hurry. The President is waiting. Do you really think I could be a politician? You're more than qualified. My work is done, so I'll take this. Wait, aren't you going to meet the President? If not, you won't get a seat! But... What a shame. I thought we'd work more together. Let me ask one thing. When you set off the explosion in KIM's house, was my joining you part of the broader plan? We didn't set that off. It wasn't you? Let's say it was. 17 Years Later, Seoul 1988 This place looks the same, right? Have you been well? Yes. I just live a quiet life. I heard about you on the news. About being kidnapped. Your time in prison. Being sentenced to death. And losing the election again last year. Before the election, some people came to see me. The man who is now president asked for my help. Go on back. You guys will win anyway. KIM Woon-bum and KIM Young-ho are going to split the vote, so you don't need my help. I should have yielded to him. I'll always regret that. Sometimes I think, how nice it would be if we could turn back time. But that's not possible. When I was young I raised chickens. But one day they stopped laying. Then I saw that my neighbor was stealing eggs. So I told the village foreman, but the neighbor was his relative and he wasn't punished. What would you do in that situation? I'd give him the next day's eggs as a present. Tell him sorry for suspecting him. If he had any conscience, he'd reconsider. What if he had no conscience? That's a hard one. I guess I'd find you and ask for help. I'd probably propose a method you don't like. Hell, I know that. My dear respected citizens. The 1997 election marked the first time For the first time in our history, that opposition candidate defeated the ruling party. I celebrate with you the election of an opposition candidate, SEO Chang-dae was not present to witness it. having overcome many trials and hurdles. To you who have birthed a new government, I give my undying thanks and praise... SUL KYUNG-GU LEE SUN-KYUN Directed by BYUN SUNG-HYUN
