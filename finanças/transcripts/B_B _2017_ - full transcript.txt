There's no discrimination now that everyone's treated exactly the same just like you wanted. You won't be happy 'til we're out of business. - All I want is a bed for the night, like Mary and Joseph. - Mary and Joseph didn't put shit through their letterbox. - Neither did we. - There's a dozen places around here you could've stayed. - I'm staying here with my husband. - You want to call him that, I'm not gonna stop you. - Funny, you won't stop us expressing our love either. - I have earplugs.

I'll check out the facilities. (crows cawing) (soft eerie music) - [Josh] Joining us for dinner? - Love to. Do you have a menu? - It's lamb. Unless you're vegetarian. I had to let the cook go.

(door knocking) What is it? (door latch clicking) - I'm on your side. - Okay. - I wasn't sure a year ago. - I'm sorry? That can't be easy. - Well, you're making it a lot harder. You come and you wind him up and I have to live with it. - We're not tryin' to wind anyone up. - Well what then? - You're speaking to the wrong agitator. - You can't hate him more than I do.

(door latch clicking) (faucet squeaking) (water trickling) (Jeep rumbling) (brakes squeaking) (gravel crunching) (shoes squishing) (Jeep door slamming) (silverware clinking) - His kid's gay, poor bastard. - Let's not make things worse for him. Why don't we just call it quits and go home? - That's telling him that we don't deserve to be here. - He's in a vulnerable place, Marc. - I wish I could wrap you around my little finger that easily. How old are you Paul? - 16. - As long as you're legal to serve alcohol. - You need a refill? - No, no I'm just checking. - He started it. - He was cruising you, vulnerable my ass. What? - Why don't you cut him some slack? - What, dad too? - It is his home. - Well he can do what he wants at home. He can hate on us all he likes. Not when he's running a business. - Do you want to change his mind or make him eat shit? - Either, or. - Remind me why I married you? (feet stomping above) (somber music) - Oh dear, it looks like Josh's invitation has backfired big time. He's gay. Hi there. How do you like the place? I'm Marc and this is Fred. (speaking Russian) Sorry? - Did you shoot the boy? (speaking Russian) - Didn't mean to disturb you. Enjoy your meal. Don't worry, there's always barely legal. - Hi. (speaking Russian) Does anyone speak Russian? - Nyet. - No. (muffled conversation) - Sounds like Phil. (speaking Russian) - Let me show you. - Well it looks like your boyfriend's got a new crush. - Someone should tell him to be careful. - Dad's gonna have to deal with this sometime. - I was talking about the Russian. I wouldn't flow with him. - Our comrade is gay. - How do you know? - He checked me out. - He sized you up for a smack in the mouth. - What have I done? - You're gay, he's Russian. - Now you're being racist. - He looks like a neo-Nazi. - How did we get to Nazis? - Josh put a call out for like-minded bigots. Did you not think anyone would turn up? - Having tattoos and being Russian does not make you a Nazi. - Everything okay in here? - The food is great, but I thought you could settle an argument for us. Stop kicking me, stop it. The Russian, is he with you or with us? - I don't follow. - Is he gay or straight? - Oh come on boys, you wouldn't want me broadcasting your preferences to strangers. Not everyone is as tolerant as I am. - The Russian's on his side. That's why he was staring at us, he saw our picture. Have you seen what they do to gays in Russia? - Racist. - Gimme a shout if you need anything. - Do we need to pay now? - I trust you. You've barely eaten. - No, I've had enough. - Don't you want to see what's for dessert? - Not for me, thanks. - I'll have another glass. - I didn't sign up for this. I told you the first sign of violence I am out the door. No. - I have another glass coming. - Bring it up. - I am not going to hide in my room. (mysterious music) (bell ringing) - Can I have an alarm call? I keep my phone off at night. - What time? - Nine? - There were no phones in the room, so it will be a knock on the door and I'm not coming in to check. - Perfect.

It's about picking your moment. - I'm 16, he can't stop me. He can throw me out. He will throw me out, I don't care. - If you care about your dad, I don't think Alexei's gay. - Did you talk to him? - He doesn't look gay to me and I've got a bit more experience. - How does he look? - Dangerous. - When you two came last year, I made a promise. I'm not gonna put up with this anymore. - Does it have to be tonight? - He likes me. - That's what gay bashers do. You're not going to his room? - No, there's a park. He's got a map alright?

He's always known. He just expects me to go though life lying. You know he actually said, "If my son was gay, "I'd kill myself." - If he knew you were gay, he wouldn't say that. He wouldn't think it. Hold on. - I can't. - You don't have to go through with it. - Are you lost? You don't have to go through with what? - [Paul] You'll find out soon enough. - [Josh] What were you telling him? - [Paul] I was telling him how mum drank herself to death because she couldn't stand it anymore! - [Josh] Keep your voice down, control yourself. - [Paul] It should've been you! (hand smacking) (ominous music) - What's happened? - He's not on Facebook. - Well they haven't made that a crime yet. Alexei Petrovich, It's like calling yourself Mr Smith. I saw him coming out the shower. He is covered in tattoos. This one means somebody's done murder. The blood drops is a body count. This one means he's a high-ranking criminal. - What is this, neo-Nazi bingo? - And this one means that he's served more than five years. Yes bingo, full house let's go. - You've got a pair of army pants. That doesn't make you Jason Bourne. - He has got Jesus all over his back. - So he's got gay basher literally written all over him? - Yes. - Sort of like a map? He's religious all right. He spends a lot of time on his knees. This is the local cruising area. He was scoping it all throughout dinner. He left it on the table. It's a come-on. - He's scoping targets. It is a come-on but instead of hooking us, he hooked Paul. Let's go, please. - No. - For me. - Don't do that. - For me. - Don't do that! - If he's gay, why does he keep looking at us like we're the enemy? - We're the competition. He thinks that we are after Paul too. I'm not chasing you. I'm... (Marc sighing) (door knocking) - You might wanna keep an eye on Paul tonight. - I don't need parenting advice from you. - I'm talking about the Russian. - The only homosexuals here tonight are you two. You got enough down here. (ominous music) (door latch clicking) (feet stomping) - Apology accepted. - Have you got a signal? He's blocked us in, we can't get out. - Well, we'll ask him to move. - He could have parked anywhere. - I'll ask him. - No wait. - You're afraid of the way he parks now? - No, I tried to call a taxi. There's no signal outside, downstairs, up here and there was when we came right until he went back into his room. O2 and Vodafone? - Why would he block our phones? - To stop us from calling the police after he's kicked the shit out of us. - If I could prove to you that far from being a gay basher our Russian is as queer as Christmas, would you please come to bed? - No trying to prove anything. (water trickling) (keys rattling) Stop it! - Is that gay enough for you? Who else packs like that? - Army. (clothes rustling) - Hello, is that a phone jammer in his pocket or is he just pleased to see me? (ominous music) - Oh shit! Put it back. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. (keys rattling) - Hi, do you have that landline we can use? - No, sorry. - No you don't have one or no we can't use it? We'll pay. - No signal? Well we're clear as a bell around here. - I know you have one, it's urgent. - Staff only. (foreboding music) - Did you ask him to intimidate us? - You pushed your lifestyle down my throat, but you feel intimidated? What were you doing in my son's room? If anyone deserves a kicking, it's you. - Okay we need to go right the... Fuck! (visor buzzing) - Alright, admittedly these are a bit niche, but people use these all the time on trains for peace and quiet. - We're not on a fucking train. - And technically they are illegal yes, but maybe he forgot to turn it off. - No Marc, there was a signal long before he arrived. So he made a point of turning it on, so he can wait until it gets dark, so he can slip into something more comfortable. (door banging) (whispering and buzzing) - No no, leave it on, he'll know it was us. - We've gotta call the police. - It's too late, they won't be able to get here in time. - No, Marc! (bell dinging) God! (Fred breathing heavily) - Thank you. I know it's wrong, but seeing you put the wind up them felt great. Sleep well. (speaking Russian) (door latch clicking) - No no no, we can get arrested for wasting police time. He hasn't done anything!

(Jeep doors slamming) (Jeep revving) (yelling in Russian) (pulsating dance music) You really had me going. - What about Paul? - Paul prefers Russians. - Just because he's not after us, doesn't mean he's not dangerous. - Didn't block us in, didn't stop us leaving. - Tried to get into our room. - Tried to get into our room. - Phone jammer. - Peace and quiet. - Infrared goggles. - It's dark. - He's not cruising, he's hunting. - Well don't tell me, tell dad. - I don't know if he knows, but Paul thinks... - Of course he knows. Why do you think he's so fucking furious? - Marc, this is not for us to get involved. - Well according to you, he's getting driven out there to get murdered. What could be more important? - What if I'm wrong? I can't just out him. - You are wrong. - Where is he taking him? - Well maybe they've just gone for a spin. - We found a phone jammer and night vision goggles in his case and a map of the local park. - Which your son filled out for him. - We think he might have gone to bash queers. - Or he might be gay himself. - The Russian? (Marc laughing) - I'm gonna let you two thrash this out. I'm going to bed. If you're worried, why didn't you call the police? Oh no but you can't, can you? You can't have them thinking your son's a homosexual. - Do you want us to go look for him? - I want you to get your nose out of my family. - You heard the man. (banging and shuffling) (soft, somber music) I rest my case. No one died. - Marc! - He came to teach me a lesson. - Gays are very spiteful. - If you were hunting gays, you'd wanna know where they hang out. - Oh just admit you're wrong. - Is Paul in danger? - Yes, danger of having a good time. - Is he gonna get beaten up? - You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? We're done! - I haven't got a car, I had to sell it to pay the legal fees. - Homophobia can be a very expensive lifestyle. - Help me. - Get a taxi. - I don't wanna waste any time. - You don't want anyone to know where you're going. You'll still be recognized. Every faggot in a 50 mile radius knows who you are. - Give us a minute. A teenager looked at me. Would it be better if I hadn't told you? - If it was the other way around, do you really think he would be playing the Good Samaritan for us? - Were you ever 16? - You are such a drama queen. - And you're a prick. - You sure it would be better if I didn't go? - You mean you thought. (Marc and Josh grunting) (Marc breathing heavily) (door rattling) - Sorry. (alcohol trickling) Did you know when you were 16? - I knew when I was eight. - Everybody just knows, like it's the most natural thing in the world. - Unless you decide not to know. - Anything else I could support him: drugs, stealing, murder. - Tell him that you love him no matter what. - There's more to being a father. Why am I asking you? - Just tell him. - I won't save him. You think if I had enough you could turn me? I don't dislike you, Marc. You seem like a decent person beside from this one thing. - It's not one thing, it's who I am. - The first step on any recovery is you separate who you are from what you do. - Can you separate being straight from being with a woman? - I haven't been with a woman since my wife died. - You think that's what God wants? - It wouldn't be fair on Paul. - And keeping him in the closet, that is fair? - He's had girlfriends. - So have I. - Then you know, you see? You know you can do it. - Do you remember your first time? Here's to Paul. (foreboding music) (banging and rustling) (door slamming) (cellphone alerting) (foreboding music) (soft piano music) (car rumbling) (brakes squeaking) (foreboding music) (visor buzzing) - Help.

He told me I could borrow his Jeep if I kept my mouth shut. - In Russian? - He speaks English. - Since when? - He didn't fancy you. - That's one toxic little queen you've spawned there. (gravel crunching) (Paul weeping) Fred! (Fred crying) Hey! Hey, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. (Fred weeping) Hey, it's okay. Hey. (Fred weeping loudly) Hey, it's okay. Did he have a knife? - Didn't need one. He could've broken my neck. - All you've got is scratches. - Don't you believe me? - I found this in his case. Now I haven't seen all of them but, well, you get the general idea. (soft, somber music) He wasn't a queer basher. He was a Peeping Tom. - I'm the queer basher. - No, you haven't done anything. - You weren't there. You don't know how it looked. He wasn't coming in for a snog. The Peeping Tom would've run off. Maybe he doesn't keep the ones where he beats them up. - The longer you leave this, the worse it looks. It already looks terrible. - We need to get our stories straight. - We don't need a story. - If you love your husband, you'll wanna listen before you call the police. - Oh now he's my husband? - Fred, you were right. He wasn't gay. He tried to attack Paul. When he got away, he looked for someone else. Paul saved you. - I think I'd like to hear this from the horse's mouth. - I've given him a sedative, he's exhausted. - Lying his ass off. He told me you were trying to cop-off with the Russian. - He is a child, he panicked. - He's old enough to kill someone, he's old enough to answer for it. - You are so brave. When it comes to taking a piss out of a Christian you know can't fight back, but when a young man, a young gay man actually takes on the real enemy who tried to kill your husband, you want him locked up. - Yes, that's correct. We draw the line at killing. Oh, will someone find the fucking thing and turn it off? - Use the phone downstairs. (bottles clinking) - Where's the phone? - Last night of freedom. - You are an innocent bystander. - If that's how you wanna play it. But here's what Paul's gonna say, he's gonna say Fred took him to the park then got jealous when he preferred Alex. There was a fight and Fred caved his head in. There's no way anyone can prove who did what. Paul is 16, Fred's a grown man and we all know you came here looking for a fight. It's called being a father. - We'll see him in court. - No, I will! - Don't let him... - This is your fault! - Boys, keep it down. - Sit here and listen! Shut up! - There is no need to put you or Paul through any of this. There's nothing to connect him with us. He didn't look, he turned up out of the blue. There's nothing on his phone. He didn't leave a trail because he came here to bash queers. Somebody bashed him first, end of story. Happy ending. (glasses clinking) - He didn't leave a trail, but we did. We're booked in the same night a dead body turns up five miles away. - Better make sure it doesn't turn up then, at least not around here. Clock's ticking. - There'll be forensic evidence. Paul won't be able to keep his story straight. - I helped him do it. I didn't mean to but I did. (door rattling) - You can't move him by yourself. - I'm not moving him anywhere. - We're equal. We're just like you. Our love is the same. We're married. I would've killed for my wife. You're not equal. You're fake. - I love you. I'll be back in a couple of hours. - We're barely married and I'm supposedly hooking up with some weirdo in night goggles? Fuck him! It's my word against his. - No. No it isn't. There's video. Night goggles, he records it. We can prove what happened. (chuckles softly) (lips smacking) - Now I'm confused. If he was gonna attack me, he wouldn't be recording it. - No no, I don't think he was going to attack you. - Oh so let's hope he was beaten to death by mistake? - There is no fucking pleasing you, is there? - Stay with Paul. - We're doing it. (door slamming) - Where's this come from? - Well you. Richer or poorer, better or worse. Nice sermon. - Fine. Let's all go to the police. - We're not going to the police. - This is how it's gonna be: one of you stays or it's the police. - I now where he is. - I'm doing it. - Paul's sedated, don't wake him up. - Lock yourself in. - If you help him move that body, you're an accomplice. - I'm not going to touch it. I'll check the video, if it proves your clear, I'll leg it. - What if it doesn't? - It will. - Don't move that body, promise me.

(cellphone beeping) (snapping and gasping) (foreboding music) (rain pattering) (Marc breathing heavily) - I have to go for a piss. - I'm not stopping you. Where I can see you. (rain pattering) I can't go when you're watching me. - If you can't, it means you don't need to. (foreboding music) Put it away. (Paul groaning) (ominous music) (Paul breathing heavily) - [Fred Voiceover] You don't have to go through with it.

We're burying everything, go to bed. - Where are we going to dump it? I wanna know where we're going. - You're gonna go back to the house. - How are you gonna get back? - I'm gonna dump the body and we're gonna dump the Jeep. They need to be far apart. I shall dump the Jeep tomorrow. - Probably weighs a ton. (Jeep door slamming) (Jeep engine roaring) (feet stomping) (door knocking) - I'm not asleep. - [Paul] I'm sedated and I can't sleep. - What? (soft, somber music) - Thanks. You stopped my dad from going to the park. - I wish I hadn't. - He sent me a text instead. You were right, he loves me. He's going to see what I did. I only wanted what you've got. I just don't want my dad to know. - Know what? - How much I hated him. - Who's going to tell him? - You, and I won't let you. (door latch rattling) (brakes squeaking) Where's my dad? - [Marc] Dumping your boyfriend. (Jeep rumbling) - That was nothing to do with me. - Let's just see what happened. (door knocking) Fuck off, Paul! - [Paul] Give it to me. - It must have come on when he was hit. (Alexei yelling in Russian) - [Paul] Get off him! (Alexei yelling in Russian) - Stop! - You said stop. - What was Alex saying? (Alexei speaking Russian) (ominous music) (Alexei yelling Russian) - What the fuck? - They were coming to kill him. - Shit, shit! Okay I'll grab him and you run. (door latch rattling) Open the fucking door! (ominous music) You're lighter. Go! (Fred grunting) (fabric ripping) No, Fred! (Fred gasping) (door squeaking) (ominous music) - [Fred] Go ahead! (Fred and Marc breathing heavily) (engine grinding) - Oh no no, fuck fuck! Fuck fuck, no! (Marc and Fred panting) We cannot stay here. - Yes, we can! - They might have a shotgun. (cellphone ringing) Wait, shh shh. One thing we are not doing is going back in the house. - That has got to be Josh. - Do not go in the house, Marc. - If Paul was in there, he would've picked up already. - Don't go in, get back! (cellphone ringing) - Fred! (Paul groaning) (dramatic music) - Please don't tell my dad. (Paul gasping) (Jeep horn beeping) (Jeep roaring) (breaks squeaking) - (pants) Phone. (cellphone ringing) - Yes, Marc! - [Josh] Open the door. - We didn't do it! - [Josh] I'm not blaming you Fred, but I need something to stop the bleeding. - Okay well get us the phone and we can call an ambulance. Hang up. - [Josh] An ambulance takes 20 minutes. - The longer you fuck with us, the longer it will be. Get off the line. - [Josh] I've already called an ambulance. They said, "Get him into the warmth and stop the bleeding." - He's lying. - [Josh] If he dies, it's on you! - Okay well, we'll call the police and then we will talk about it. - [Josh] He's lost a lot of blood, please. - Look, just get off the line so we can talk to someone that's not you. (ominous music) Oh, come on. - [999 Operator] Emergency Services Operator, which service do you require? - Police and ambulance. - [999 Operator] And where are you calling from? - It's the St Jude's B&B, it's on Rafeston Road. - Halsey Road South. - Halsey Road South, there's been a stabbing. A suicide attempt. Hello? - [999 Operator] We have a request for an ambulance at that address. - No no no, we still need the ambulance. It's the same incident. - Tell 'em to send a police car first. - Did you get that? - [999 Operator] Are the assailants still on the premises? - Oh, come on! - We didn't stab anyone, he did it himself. - [999 Operator] Have you brought the victim inside? - What? No, we're not going to. - Why not? - Because it's complicated. Can you just tell everyone to come as soon as they can? - [999 Operator] Sir, it's not complicated. He's bleeding heavily and going into shock. - These people are threatening us. - [999 Operator] The ambulance will be with you in under 20 minutes. - Well what about the police? - [999 Operator] Paramedics aren't allowed to attend unless... - Okay how long, how long? - [999 Operator] Police will be with you in less than 20 minutes. In the meantime, you need to attend to the victim. - We are the victim! Fuck! (ominous music) Take over. - We need to talk before they get here. (Paul gasping and wincing) - I don't trust him. (speaks indistinctly) - Show it to me, I wanna see what happened. - You'll flush it. - I swear on Jesus Christ. On my son's life. - You can't protect him anymore. - He's my son! - He wanted you dead. It was supposed to be you. The plastic sheet, it was for you. You drove him to it. - No, he's not gay. He told me he couldn't go through with it. - Killing you! That's what he couldn't go through with. - (sighs) Is there anything I can do? He's 16. I'll do anything. You want me on my knees, I'm on my knees. He tried to kill himself. What more do you want? Can't you forgive him? - It's not my call. - I forgive him. - Of being a murderer or being a faggot? (head smacking) (Paul wincing) - Don't let him see it. (soft somber music) - This is the house. You check-in here. Bedroom's upstairs. Dad's room. My room. (Paul speaking Russian) (toilet flushing) - Son. (gurgling) - [Fred] Marc? Marc! (visor buzzing) Marc! (Fred breathing heavily) (men speaking Russian) - [Josh] They've been harassing us for years. Shit in our letterbox, death threats. They got some Russian thug to join in. That's his Jeep. (speaks indistinctly) ...one of them means to kill him or not. They didn't give a knife to Paul. - Marc! (Marc breathing heavily) - [Marc] Fred! (Marc screaming) (Marc grunting) (soft, somber music) (CB radio chatter) (thunder rumbling) (soft, somber music) (birds chirping) (bell dinging) - [Paul] So. - You're not gay anymore? - He's in prison. - Anything else? - You won't be able to keep it up. - Hasn't been a problem so far. - Let's go, you can't save other people. - My dad saved me. (soft piano music) (jail gate banging) - [Josh] Bless me Father, for I have sinned. It's good to talk to someone who understands. It's not blackmail if that's the only way to rescue someone. I'm not saving him from prison, I'm saving him from Hell. Five years is nothing against eternity. He might feel it's fake at first, but God can open any heart. The longer he walks the path, the more he'll learn what love is. Real love. (soft, rhythmic music) (ominous music) (soft, piano music)
