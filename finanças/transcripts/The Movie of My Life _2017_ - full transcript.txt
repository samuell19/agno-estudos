O Filme da Minha Vida - The Movie of My Life - Before, I'd only watch the kickoff and the end of movies. The beginning, to get to know the story, and the end, because the end is always beautiful, right? I wasn't the one who said that. That was my father. Then I realized that the middle is as crucial as the beginning and the end. My name is Tony Terranova. I'm 20 years old, long-legged, and sleeping well doesn't rank first on things I'm good at. My father is French. My mom is Brazilian. Here, in Remanso, beauty never lasts forever. - Don't tell mom about this! - All right. - You promise? - Yeah! My father would always tell me to live a balanced life, you have to ride on two wheels. He had few friends. And they were part of our family. My father was good-hearted, he believed in people. And I do, too. He was a simple man, who dreamed that I'd make something out of myself. So I moved to the state capital to study. The day I left was a blast. Shame I can't say the same about my return. When I got back, with my teacher's diploma, my dad got into the same train and went away to France, two years ago. I arrived and he left. And the rest... I can't tell you. - Four, five, six. - Four, five, six. - Again, please. - Four, five, six. - Seven, eight, nine, ten. - Seven, eight, nine, ten. Faster, kids! Faster! - Seven, eight, nine, ten. - Faster! Faster! - Seven, eight, nine, ten. - Faster! Faster! - Seven, eight, nine, ten. - Very good, very good. Now... - What's this? - An apple! No, une pomme. - Une pomme! - Again, please. - Une pomme. - Now... What's this? Teacher! This class is so boring! The good part of life is women, brothel, Cat-House. Would you take me there? Bye, bye. I dreamed I was going to the moon. And the trip was by motorcycle. Flying motorcycle. I couldn't see the pilot's face. But when we got to the moon, the pilot was a woman, and she was Miss Brazil and I took some photos of her. Then a Martian showed up. He said he was my cousin. He hugged me, he was slimy and he said... I can't remember what he said. But I'll tell you later. I'll remember, OK? Wait, one step back. Put on a teacher's face. They say Liz Taylor and Sinatra can't get enough of Acapulco. If I ever go there, I'll ask him for an autograph. Him, not her. She's weird. She got married three times. Do you know what I like most in the world? To daydream. I can't wait until vacations so I'll be able to daydream more. Tony. Did you get any letters from your father? - Bye. - Bye! - Goodbye, Sofia. - Bye, Tita. Tony! Hey, Paco. How are you? I want to have a word with you, may I come in? Of course. - Who's winning? - Shut up! He could go down now, but punches again! He tries a left jab, he quickly dodged, he tries to swing, but stays on the ropes. A dangerous move! He throws an uppercut! Amazing! He hit the liver with his left. Eloy Sanchez hit the canvas. This time he's not getting up. Counting at four, five, seven. Listen up! Éder can be the champion. Éder Jofre is the champion! How's school? It's all right. - Is your mom all right? - Yeah. Mrs. Mafalda now has a TV at home. Yeah, a tube. Cocky. Nothing can replace the radio. Nothing. The TV is an invention that isn't going anywhere. It's a box for silly people. Your father's a man of the world. He's like a wild bull, he doesn't like corrals. He'll come back whenever he wants. I mean, who knows what he's up to in France? France is on the other side of the world. Nicolas is a great guy, but you should forget about him, Tony. Do your own thing, kid. You're a precious boy. Your mother is wonderful. She should get married again. God knows if your father has another family now. Do you think Nicolas worries about you? If he did, he'd send you a letter. He didn't do that even on your birthday. It's been over a year. Forget about it, Tony. Do your own thing, boy. Pulling a face won't get you ahead in life. Pulling a face won't get you ahead in life. Who won? You're kidding me! I knew it! I knew it! Always look ahead! Look ahead! Far! Look ahead! Almost! Push a little harder! Come on, keep going! No, no! Push harder, boy! You're riding it, boy! Go! Go! You guys, have you ever been to the Cat-House? - Many times. - It's so groovy! I have my own room there, everybody knows me. You've been there too, right? It's super groovy! RED RIVER COMING SOON TO ROXY IN FRONTERA CONGRATULATIONS TO PETRA MADEIRA, OUR HOMECOMING QUEEN Is this book only for kids, Dad? - The children go here. - Three more. Was it hard to shoot this, Dad? Very difficult. Look at his face. The groom was nervous, shaking all over... Honey, can you set the clock for Dad? Sure. It stopped a long time ago. Dad, have you ever been to the Cat-House? Yes. What is there to see? Women. Petra. Maybe you could help us with that school choreography. That teacher is too slow. - Me? - Yes. You think I can remember? I know you think it's childish, but of course you can. You've always been the best. Okay, I'll enjoy helping you out. Have you ever thought about getting married, having babies? Yes. Have you ever been madly in love? Yes, I have. - Was it good? - It was. Great. I think time doesn't exist. I don't know. Someone invented this to count the hours. The years. People age when they have to. During that time you were away from home, time stopped for me. - Good night. - Good night. Can you believe Mafalda came down to my work to ask me if I'd stolen her chicken? She's crazy! Instead of sewing, she keeps bothering people. What does she think? That I stole her chicken for soup? - I shouted and sent her away. - Where is he, Mom? Still in France? Do you think he'll ever come back? Why did he leave? Doesn't he miss us at all? - Why didn't you do anything? - You didn't do anything either! My dear father, This is a farewell letter. It may never reach you, because France is too far away. But I'm taking chances to write these words anyway. No absence is as dear as yours, and in the back of my memory, I keep the memories of you alive. I go on living, taking uncertain steps, sleeping too little and daydreaming. And there, in my dream, perhaps that's where you are. Right there, perhaps, that's where my stolen dream is. Why did you leave? Why no explanations? The past jumbles up my present. And I must find my future. You always told me that the most important things are our eyes and our feet. The eyes to see the world, and the feet to go and meet the world. And that's what I'm going to do, Father. It's time to meet the world. I baked the bread the way you like it. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. - Do you like it? - Yes, I do. Want to have some wine with me one of these days? I'm not in the mood, Paco. You aren't the type of woman to be locked in the house all day. Good morning. ♪ For cough, flu or cold A hot toddy is gold ♪ ♪ For cough, flu or cold A hot toddy is gold ♪ ♪ A healthy family drinks hot toddy ♪ ♪ For cough, flu or cold A hot toddy is gold ♪ ♪ For cough, flu or cold A hot toddy is gold ♪ Well, I need to get going. Bye, Sofia! - Bye, Paco! - Tony. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, son. Have a nice day. I can't put you through, I'll leave a message and call you back. Can you believe Paco invited me for a drink? - Paco? That Paco? - Yes, Paco. You should go! Does he stink a bit? Yes! He's a bit silly, too, but he's nice, a good man. Hey, Mom! Hello. Red River is on in Frontera. Do you want to come? - I'm not in the mood. - Well, I can go instead! What's that movie about? John Wayne is a farmer who'll get married to a lovely woman, but one day he needs to abandon the convoy. Then his fiancée is murdered by the Indians in an ambush. And then... Then he adopts an orphan boy. Meanwhile, his son grows up, becomes a great shooter and goes to war. Then, when he comes back from war, they have to cross the Red River with 10,000 livestock, in the meantime, he might have been betrayed by his own son. And the end I can't tell you. How come you know so much about that movie? I heard it on the radio. Bye, Mom. See you. Bye, son. Elisa, do I have a chance with you? You're a very sweet boy. But you're too young. I prefer the older ones. But I'm growing up! You're growing up, not a grown-up. Others have grown up, you see? Okay, to your positions! Get ready! Five, six, seven, eight! Teacher, we got the money. Now we can set off. - Where to, Augusto? - To the Cat-House. - Take me to Frontera! - Not a good time now, kid. I bet you've never slept with a girl, have you? Listen. Maybe I'll go there tomorrow. And maybe I'll help you. Do we have a deal? Great. You guys. Mine has a lot of skin. Is that normal? - Have you been sleeping well? - Not really. Sleeping is essential, I always say that. Thanks. You know what's funny, I can never remember dreams. I never dream. That's even funnier. I've never had a single dream in my life. Any news about my father? No. Is your mother all right? I need to go to Frontera tomorrow, can you come with me? That dump? You never go there. Why now? I need to buy a gift for Augusto's birthday. Oh, OK. All right. I confess. I need to go to the Cat-House, Paco. I desperately need to sleep with a woman. The Madeira sisters... They're so beautiful... So, so beautiful. The older one has such big breasts. - The younger has those legs... - You're drowning in a puddle! Petra finished school, but what has she done with her life? Pageants. That's not a job. Petra is always on the make. She was missing for a while, God knows what she was up to. Fine, Petra's a grown woman, but she's pretty weird. The younger one looks all right, but how can we trust any of the Madeira sisters? Do I have a chance with them? Of course. You work. You're a precious boy. You don't live with the pigs cleaning the pen. Do you know the difference between a man and a pig? A man knows what he wants. He knows he's a man. A pig doesn't. A pig is a pig all the time. It doesn't know it's a pig. It's just a pig. A total pig. That is the difference between a man and a pig. If you come to the Cat-House tomorrow it'll mean a lot... - Tomorrow? No way. - I'll go by myself then! - Shall we go, gentlemen? - Go where? - To the Cat-House! - Say it louder, please! Take me with you! Take it easy! I'll buy you a gift and we'll talk later! Not another globe like last year! - Didn't you like it? - Of course not! Weird gift. A bunch of countries spin around while I'm stuck in here. - Take me to the Cat-House! - Say it louder! Teacher! I can hook you up with my sister. She's crazy about you! - Petra or Luna? - Luna, of course! She loves you, all she does is talk about you... - She even wrote a letter. - A letter? Yes. I found it in her panty drawer. In the panty drawer? What did it say? - That you're a remarkable man. - A remarkable man? - And that you're educated. - I'm educated? If you keep repeating, this isn't going anywhere! She imagines you on the beach in Acapulco. - And what else? - Stuff... - Speak up! - Introduce me to a woman! Back off, boy! Teacher! Take me to the Cat-House! Teacher! Take me with you! Whatever happened to that girlfriend of yours? She must be scaring people. She was so ugly that when she was born, the doctor said, "Throw her up high! If it flies, it's a beetle!" Come on! She was so kind. Better unkind but beautiful. She was ugly even from afar. Those gloves could make a nice gift for Augusto. They're expensive, Tony. - Want to give up the ladies? - No. That glove on someone's face. Think of the damage. I don't like fights, I never raised my hand to anyone. LIFE'S DIARY That toilet is a pigpen. They must've killed a goat in there. Did you enjoy the soup? Are you ready to order? Not yet, but go ahead and bring the rice. Would you like to try the house white? White wine is good for washing your feet. Red wine and rice, then we'll decide. Another red wine, come on! Thank you. Do you think about getting married, having kids? Kids? What for? No kids, because I like sleeping. No marriage either, because I like to get laid. Augusto Madeira is a real pain. I'd give him no present at all. I'm not going to be kind next time. I'll hit him with a dead cat until the cat meows. He's desperate to lose his virginity, give him a break. You too, but you aren't climbing walls. Who says I'm a virgin? Red River is on. How about watching it? Tony, that's a waste of time. I bet that movie sucks. Shall we get going? - You haven't even seen it. - And I won't. Cinema is a dark thing where you watch other people's lives and waste two hours of your own. Come on. You said the Cat-House opens at 7:00 PM. You get there early to catch fresh fish. Come on. If you want to go ahead, fine. I'll watch that movie. I'll go to the restroom. Don't leave this room! The boy fancied to come here. I had to join him. Don't leave this room! For God's sake, don't leave this room! - Hi. - Hi. What's your name? Antonio, but everybody calls me Tony. What do you do for a living, Tony? I'm a teacher, and you? A whore. Shall we? Do you think I am a man or a pig? Are you all right, Paco? You look weird. Are you in love? Could you hug me? You can go ahead and take off your clothes... Sit down. What class do you teach? Geography? - No, but I can... - I love geography. I know all the capital cities in the world. I keep imagining all those places. Let me see... - Bolivia? - Piece of cake! La Paz. - Egypt? - Easy. Cairo. - Italy? - Rome. Belgium? Is it Prague? It's Brussels. - Spain? - Madrid! - Cuba? - Havana! Havana! When I was young, I took part in a bike race on Cerro San Cristóbal. It was hard because the finishing line was on top of the hill, next to the statue of the Virgin Mary. With a superhuman effort I kept the lead. Then, I suddenly looked back, and saw Death following me on a bike. I crossed the line and won it. Then I looked back again, and I saw when Death fell off her bicycle and died. You beat Death? In that case you're... ...immortal. For now. What about me? Immortal. - For now? - For now. Cheers, Esteban! Cheers! Was it good? If you were my geography teacher, what grade would you give me? - Hungary. - Budapest. My grade? A+. Is that a gift for your girlfriend? No, it's for a student. Don't you have anyone? I do. Yes, I do. Her name's Luna. - Pretty name. - Yeah. If you ever come back, I can help you. They call me Camelia here, but it's not my real name. - What's your name? - Cremilda. Pretty name. Camelia, I have a student, Augusto, who'll turn 15, and he's dying to come here. Could you assist him? Of course! But it has to be earlier, before the shift begins. You know, he's a virgin boy. You were a virgin too, but it was all right, wasn't it? I wasn't a virgin! - How was it? - Excellent. - And the girl? - Excellent. Yours? She didn't talk much. This city is a dump. I won't ever set foot in Frontera again. Can we get this train going? No, I am, as they say, very organized. But I used to be always in a hurry. One day, I got the train moving before the time and I ran over a little cow. It wasn't too bad, as we had a great barbecue. But that incident changed my life forever. My way of thinking. That little cow got stuck in my mind. Day and night, until I realized it was a sign. If you push things forward, the train goes off the rails. - Do you like what you do? - Yes, very much. My job is such a noble one. Very beautiful. Marvelous. Why do you think your job is beautiful? Because I take people to settle their issues. Do you know what Augusto told me? What? That Luna likes me. What if I invited her to the movies? I think she'll love it. ♪ As always ♪ ♪ As always You'll get undressed ♪ ♪ As always, you'll lay down ♪ ♪ As always, you'll kiss me ♪ ♪ As always ♪ Did you like it? Very beautiful, teacher. - Shall we go to Frontera? - Yes, to Frontera! - Shall we go to Frontera? - Yes, to Frontera! One lady will take care of you, she has a flower name: Camelia. Tony Terranova. No clue why my sister's coming too, but thanks anyway. Augusto, remember that globe I gave you? Take it to her. She'll like it. Okay, but what do I give first? The globe or the money? The money first. Then, you give her the whole world. What are you doing here, Dad? I work here. I play the movies. He's your brother. That's why you left. You've been here all the time. Yes. Why? To stay close to you and your mom. Tony... Tony Terranova, you're such a good man! Tony, are you okay? Are you all right? What should I tell Mom? I don't know. It's going to be all right. Paco! Paco! Sleep, my angel. Sleep, my angel. Feeling better? Such a storm, but you didn't take a coat, did you? I did, Mom, but Luna kept it. Look what she left for you. Are you all right? Yes. Teacher. We were wondering, if we saved some money, would you take us to the Cat-House, too? That would be super groovy. If you clean it well, later, when you grow up, I'll give you the motorcycle. Do you want it? Yes. Do you think you deserve it? No... Keep those tickets. Maybe you can bring Luna again. Last time, you only saw half of the movie. Do you ever watch the movies? I like it when I turn on this light and the images appear on that big screen. Before, I'd only watch the kickoff and the end of it. The beginning, to get to know the story, and the end, because the end is always beautiful. The world where everything sparkles, but where nothing is afire, provided you are beautiful, will be charmed. My heart, in the loving shadow where two beautiful eyes get fascinated, provided you are happy, will be joyful. The first one I learned from my father. My father... He walked around in funny pajamas... I know, those funny pajamas. - You've told this many times. - I know, I know... Did you enjoy the gift I sent you? - What gift? - What do you mean? My father's book of poems that you always liked. Didn't Paco give it to you? - Paco? - Paco. Did Paco know you were here? He was the one who helped me out! The letters I wrote you? He never gave them to you? I never got anything. What about the man your mom's going out with? - Is he good for you guys? - What man? My mom isn't going out with anyone. Who told you that? Paco. Are you hungry? Want some? I went to Remanso once. Only once. I saw your mom at the crops. I really wanted to talk to her. Very much indeed. But I wasn't brave enough. So I left. Jean! It's okay, I'm here. Come with me. It's all right. It's all right, boy. Dad, who's Jean's mother? Petra. Look, Tony's here! Thank you, teacher! Hey, teacher! This book is all blank. What is it for? You also complained last year, then realized it was useful. I remember how that dream ends. I flew back from the moon, on the motorcycle. The pilot wasn't Miss Brazil anymore, it was a man. And when I was almost seeing his face, I woke up. May I... I know you're Jean's mother. That'll be our secret. Tita! Looking gorgeous! Did you just say that? You never noticed me! If you ask me out, I'll forget my ditz! Sorry, I'm committed to my little girl from Acapulco. Fine. - Bye. - Bye. By the way, Mom, Luna is coming over tonight. Maybe you could go out. Unwind. Walk around. Maybe go to Frontera, buy new clothes or see a movie. No need. You can be home alone with Luna. The ticket's here and the movie is good. What movie is it? The story of a foreigner who arrives in a little town, meets a beautiful woman and has a child with her. He decides to raise his family in this beautiful place. They really loved each other. Everything is perfect until the day... The day that he gets another woman pregnant. It's a mess. The girl has to leave town, because she can't have the baby. The man is so ashamed. He says he's going back to his country and disappears. But, in fact, he's just moved to the neighboring city. He gets a job at the movie theater. And raises the child all by himself. So as not to ruin his wife's reputation. The woman he loves. And the end... I can't tell you.
