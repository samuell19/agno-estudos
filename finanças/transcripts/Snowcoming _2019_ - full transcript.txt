It was a heartbreaking loss yesterday on Super Sunday. Morning, Sam. Hey, can I have the usual? Sure. I caught up with quarterback Jake Gillette after the game. Well, you know, of course we came here to win. I wish we could have made that happen. But we were just outplayed. Jake, this must feel exceptionally bitter after winning it all last year. What about the rumours of a trade? Uh... Coach! Come on over. Hey. Good goin' today. Oh, thanks, coach. Uh, Coach Kerrigan, he, uh, he was my high school coach, he taught me everything I know about football. Samantha. Your latte and bear claw? Oh, um, thanks. He never gave up. That's my father. And he's even gonna be better next year. Huh. That's your dad? Yup. So, you must know Jake Gillette. 'Cause, you could definitely introduce me to him. [phone rings] Oh, yeah. Hey, I was just watching you on TV. Yeah, you should have been there. Jake played great. They just couldn't bring it home this year. Oh, well, maybe next year. Yeah... maybe. You okay, Dad? Yeah, well, I'm better than okay. I'm great. Okay, what's going on? Well, I've made a New Years' decision. What, you gonna skip the tie on casual Fridays? No, I'm gonna retire. What? [school bell rings] Hey, there's the bell. Love you, sweetie. Wait, Da... (Crowd) We still love you, Jak! Jake! Jake! Can I have your autograph? Thanks, man. You're the best. Thank you. [laughs] Thanks. Hi. Thank you guys. Thanks. Jake, buddy. Here, sit in my seat. Take a seat, right there. Perfect. Hey, listen. I've been on the phone all day. Interviews, couple of commercials, got some walk-on parts on some shows for ya. You're gonna love it. Yeah, great. Uh, they know I lost yesterday, right? Eh, there's losing, and then there's losing. You had yourself one heck of a season. And by the way, you look great on camera. This is a win for us, and there's always next year. Is there? I mean, have you heard anything? Not definitely, but they're not gonna trade ya. Not yet. That's why we have to look at the opportunities that are out there right now and capitalize on 'em. You know, you gotta start thinking about that next phase of your life. Hey, Samantha. You see the game last night? Uh, no. Not a fan. What do you got there? Oh, um, our publishing dates for the year. Oh. Of course, some of those may slide, but it's pretty close. Where's the rest of them? That's the full list. These are almost all non-fiction and self-help. "Bonkers for Brussels Sprouts," really? It's a working title. Brussels sprouts are very big right now. Where are my young adult titles? We've decided to postpone that initiative. You're postponing it for another year. No... Harry, you hired me to launch a series of young adult books. Samantha, I... It's been four years. I've got amazing authors lined up. You... you just keep postponing it. We're not postponing it for a year. We're postponing it indefinitely. I'm sorry. But we all love your work. We want you to stay on, absolutely. And do what? I mean, student literacy is what I know. It's been my passion since I was a kid myself. We want you to focus full-time on the cookbooks. What if I... Ah, ah. I'll talk to the board. Okay. Thanks. I don't blame Harry. I mean I want to, but I can't. It's just... It's just the entire reason you went to work for them. Exactly. Speaking of jobs, happen to run into my dad in the hallways today? Is he really retiring? No one can believe it. The whole school is walking around in a daze. It's like we've entered some alternate reality. Same. Graham's doing an article in the newspaper, and Principal Evans wants to have a ceremony for him during Snowcoming, so you'll come to that, right? Uh... I don't know. [sighs] In all these years, you've never come home for Snowcoming. You used to love it. Well, that's because I moved away. Three hours and 10 minutes away. I know this because I'm always the one who drives down there to see you. Come on, I need you to help me decorate for the Snow Ball, and chaperone. Do you think Jake's gonna be there? 'Cause I don't wanna go if he is. Not that I've heard. Okay. Okay to what? Okay to all of it. Let me arrange the time off and I'll be there. [laughs] This is why I love you. Ha, ha, ha! Hey... Looks cold. Bye. Snowcoming. This is a thing? It is a thing. I mean... at least in my hometown it is. The whole town gets together to celebrate the new year. There's a dance at the school, it's called the Snowball Dance. Of course you do. It's all about second chances and celebrating the good things to come. There's a bonfire, and everyone writes down a wish for the new year. They put it on a piece of paper and then throw the paper into the fire. Oh, and there's a Snow Bowl game. Like a football game, but in the snow. Usually disintegrates pretty quickly into a snowball fight. We consider it a good year if no one goes to the hospital with hypothermia. This sounds crazy. I don't remember you taking this time off before. That's because I haven't been back. At least not for a while. I don't go back that often. But I'm going back now. I'll be online from my dad's house. [sighs] Hey, uh, try to find some more winter recipes! Like brussels sprout soup. ♪ Hey, what a surprise, sweetie. Hey, Dad. Welcome home. Hi. [laughs] Ahh. You seen all the signs on Main Street? You are a rock star. Endlessly embarrassing. So, whatever happened to working forever? Thought you were going to die on the 50-yard line. The way I see it, a man gets to admit he's wrong three times in his life. So what were the other two? I'll let you know when it happens. [laughs] Come on. So, uh, it's so great to have you home. I also have a little surprise for you. Oh, you made hot chocolate, that is a surprise. When did you start doing that? There's a perfect number of marshmallows too. Uh, that's actually mine, but, uh... you know, you can have it. I can always make another one. Surprise? Mmm. Mmm. Hi Samantha. Jake. Wow. Yeah, long time. You've... you look great. So, Jake is gonna stay in his usual room. Your room, ready to go. No problem? His usual room? He's staying here? You're staying here? Yeah, it's kinda like my second home. Besides, I don't want coach's retirement celebration to be about me, so I'm flying under the radar. Yeah, when he comes to town, he usually likes to stay away from the press. Oh. Okay. Well, this is... fun. But um, I told Diana that I would go and visit her, so I'm gonna go do that now. You just got here. Yup. And I'll be back. You look good too. Bye. And he's just standing there like he owns the place, like it hasn't been 12 years since he's been there. I don't think it has. What do you mean? Well, Coach was always like a father to Jake, you know that. And? And I'm pretty sure he visits regularly, unlike some people I know. Can I borrow this? I don't remember how it ends. [sighs] You know what? It'll be fine. Jake and I can certainly sit in the bleachers at my dad's ceremony, but I can't share a house with him. It's just weird. Can I crash in your spare room? You can't. We're remodelling it. Why are you remodelling it? It's fine. [laughs] [screams excitedly] When are you due? [laughs] You're not even showing! I just found out last week, so I wanted to tell you in person. Graham's already pulled the room apart and started painting. He's so excited. I'm gonna be an honourary aunt. I can't believe it. No, you're not. You're gonna be a godmother. [yells excitedly] Oh! Sorry. I can't stop hugging you. It's okay. [laughs] But come anyway, I'll find something to cook. No, no, you've been working all day, you go home, you put your feet up and relax with Graham. I'll be fine. Probably barely even see him. [giggles excitedly] [laughs] ♪ [small laugh] Oh. You baked a cake? Well, you might remember that, uh, cooking wasn't exactly my superpower. Yeah. You once tried to microwave a salad. So, I took some cooking classes. Got pretty good at it, actually. If you count following a recipe. I would've thought you had staff for that. You know, just snap your fingers and a cake just appears. In fact, I have one person in charge of icing. You don't have one for chocolate and one for vanilla? You know, I thought about it, but then what happens with things like carrot cake? I mean, whose jurisdiction is that, it's just... it's too complicated. So, how's Diana? She's great. She's having a baby. Whoa! That's terrific. How's she feeling? She's Diana, you know, she's working full-time, she's pregnant, she's renovating the house. She's organizing the Snowball Dance, she's probably, you know, trekking Everest next week and forgot to tell me. [laughs] It's not bad. Hmm. Told ya. [phone buzzes] Wanna answer that? Nah. Tell me about the dance. Um, she wants me to help her decorate the gym. She wants me to help chaperone too, but... I don't know. Why not? Seriously? Sure, we had so much fun our junior year. Remember how long it took us to find a tie that matched your dress? Yeah... But I also remember senior year, sitting in the living room by myself. Hey. I must have fallen asleep on the couch. Never done that before. Oh, first time? Is that what we're gonna go with? All right, well, goodnight to all. Sweet dreams, darling. 'Night, Dad. 'Night. I'm gonna head upstairs too. Sam... I'm sorry. [sighs] ♪ ♪ All right, fire it in here old man. Ooh! Hey, cut it out! Oh! There it is. Do you remember that last game... Yeah. ...you played for me? [laughs] Wake up! It's too weird. [school bell rings] [students chatter] The big day! Hey, sweetie. Hi, Dad. -How are ya? -Mwah. What brings you here? Can't a girl bring her dad lunch at work one last time? Well, I'm gonna guess you're here because you didn't want to be alone in the house with Jake. I can neither confirm nor deny that allegation. My favourite. PB&J? It's the only one I can make. Mm-hmm. Okay, please just, uh, tell 'em to postpone for a week. Jake, buddy. They wanna film the commercial this week. We've got a lot of endorsement money riding on this. I know, I just... look, I wanna be here for Snowcoming and for coach. Fine, I'll run interference. And speaking of which, that reporter, Casey Carnes? She wants to bring a film crew up to your hometown. So, it's perfect timing since you're there anyway. Not gonna happen, Lenny. I don't want press up here. Come on, Jake. You can make the time. Sorry, Lenny. Gotta go. In an ironic twist of fate, the dog has fallen down the well and I gotta help Timmy get him out. Please tell me you made that up. Bye, Lenny. Ulgh! Ahhh! ♪ Okay... Okay. Excuse me, Ma'am. Have you heard of a book about a boy wizard from England? Samantha! Get over here and hug me! Miss Alice, how are you doing? Oh, couldn't be better. Oh, let me look at you. I haven't seen you in so long. I had to come back for my dad's ceremony, I can't believe he's retiring. Well, happens to all of us sooner or later. Hmmm. Really happy for him. This place looks exactly the same. Oh, your nook is still there. But don't get too comfortable. We're closing soon. Why are you closing so early? It's not early, not anymore. We're only open for about four hours a day now. Why? Um... Things have been going downhill for a while. We don't have enough money to buy books and new technology, and... so the students don't come. And... then we get even less funding. This place was like a second home to me. After my mom died, I came here every afternoon while my dad was at practice. I remember. Sad to see it so empty. What about this one right here? Is it my imagination or did this place get smaller? [laughs] I thought the same thing the first time I came back. Oh, Samantha! It has been way too long. Yeah. [laughs] Have you noticed Graham still wears football jerseys? I did. It's a good look on you, Graham. You're killin' it. Do you see? [laughs] She wasn't being serious, honey. Nope. Okay. Oh... speaking of being serious... [impatiently] Graham. Can you please explain to my lovely wife, Diana, that she can't be climbing ladders to decorate now? Oh yeah, you absolutely can't be climbing ladders to decorate now. Don't be silly. I'm pregnant, not incapacitated. It doesn't matter. He's right, it doesn't matter. Stay off the ladder. Yeah. Stay off the ladders, mom. [chuckles] Hmm. Jake! [laughs] Hey. Oh. So good to see you, Diana. Wow, this place got smaller, didn't it? Right? What happened to staying at home and avoiding people. Come on, you guys are friends, not people. I feel comfortable in this town. Have you met my husband, Graham? Hey, nice to meet you, Graham. Graham thinks it's nice to meet you too, he's just having a bit of a fanboy moment. No problem. Hey, congrats on the baby. Yeah. Yes. Phew. It's... [laughs] Thank you. Uh, Jake. It's a baby. I'm gonna, uh, need this hand back.... Yeah. [chuckles] So, let's uh, let's get this thing started. What can I do to help? You can help Samantha with the streamers. Okay. Okay, so uh, what do I do? Twist. All right. No... we can't both go the same way. Oh. No, uh. Just, you start, and I'll go in the opposite direction. Uh, you know there's a, uh, metaphor for our relationship in all this. [laughs] Hey, Mrs. Wells. Hey. You kids aren't allowed to be in here, we're decorating. Oh... I know, I'm... I just had a question about a reading assignment. Please? This is supposed to be a surprise. Okay, everyone out in the hall. Everyone. [clears throat] You're not everyone. Right. Wha... Well, this place is smaller than I remember, too. Wow, how many times did we sneak in here, huh? Hmm? I don't want to talk about that. So, what are we doing hiding out in here? You know, kids put their entire lives on social media. Someone finds out I'm down here, the, uh, press will descend. Right. What am I doing hiding in here? Look, Sam, I know that this is awkward. Yeah, but I just wanted to be here for Coach's ceremony. He was like a father figure to me when, uh... when I really needed one. He loves you, too. Means the world to him when you fly him all over the place for a game. Yeah, well I always seem to play better when I know he's in the stands. Look, I don't want this to be hard for you. This is important, but it's more important to me that you're comfortable. So, if you think it's better that I go, I will. Just tell me. Just tell me to go, Sam. Stay. It's good that you're here. After all, it's your Snowcoming, too. Thank you. I'm sorry if I've been acting weird. I mean, it's... it's ancient history, we've both obviously moved on. Coast is clear. I've locked the doors. Now, come help me decorate! Right. Ooh, ooh, hey. Are you sure you don't want me to get that? Well, what you lack in arms' length you definitely make up for in stubbornness. [groans] Done. See? Yeah. Care... ah, ah, careful. [sighs] We do good work. It would have taken me days to do this all by myself. Thank you. [laughs] Well, that's what friends are for. Hmm. Well guys, I'm heading home. I gotta put dinner on. You, stay off the ladders. You, hurry home. You, see you in the morning. Yeah. I'm lookin' forward to it. Did he just say he's heading home to put dinner on? That's what I heard. Hmm. What are you two doing tomorrow? Hmm? Oh, you know, just going out for a run. Together. Like friends do. You know, good friends like Jake Gillette and me. [smacks lips] Graham. Yeah, I'm just going to take these boxes back to your classroom. [strains] Oh, here we go. Thank you. So, Jake looks good. Jake looked good before he was a professional athlete, and don't look at me like that. Clearly, he still has feelings for you. You can see it every time he looks at you. Can I be blunt? You are literally never subtle. I can be around Jake right now, for my dad's sake, but that's it. There's nothing going on, there never will be. He broke my heart. He doesn't get a do-over. Okay. I'll see you later. [car alarm beeps] What do you think, Coach? It ain't bad, all right? Well, thank you. That's... that's pretty darn good, I'll tell ya. Did you make a pot roast? But you were with me all day. Put it in the crockpot this morning. Really? I called my slow cooker advisor, and uh, he explained to me how to do it. [laughs] You know, Jake and I have a deal that when he comes to visit, I do the shopping and he cooks. I'm getting really good at reading a shopping list. You two sound like an old married couple. And he never takes out the trash unless I nag. Hey! So, did, uh, you get all the decorations up? Yeah, we did. It looks great. Good. Coach, have they, uh, decided who's gonna take your job yet? No, not yet. They have to find someone who's willing to take over my PE class and my health class. And coach a football team. [phone buzzes] Well, uh, aren't you gonna miss it? Ah, it's time for some new blood. And to be honest, I'm really looking forward to starting the next chapter in my life. A lot of things I wanna do. Like what? Well, like a lot of things. I wanna spend more time at the lake, I got about a hundred books that you gave me that I... I still wanna read. Good. Speaking about books, I stopped by the library today. It hasn't changed at all. Huh, well that's nice. No, it's not. It literally hasn't changed. No new books, no technology. I mean, it's like a... like a time capsule in there. No one even uses it anymore. Hmm. Oh! This is delicious! Please, thank your slow cooker chef for me. Well, actually, you should be thanking yourself. Me, why? 'Cause I got the recipe from one of the cookbooks your company put out last year. [laughs] Let me guess, from our award-winning cookbook, "100 To Die For Chocolate Desserts?" I don't know how to answer that without making you mad at me. [laughs] Hand it over, mister. It's been a chocolate kind of week. Yes, it has. [sighs] You probably heard about mine. Yeah. I wish I could say it was a close game. But you don't lie, I know. So, tell me about your chocolate week. I was hired by New Edition to launch a line of books for teens and young adults. Coach told me how stoked you were. Yeah, I was. My boss just told me it's been shelved completely. I'm still being kept on to do cookbooks. Next up, a brussels sprouts cookbook. [laughs] Well, you can rest comfortably knowing that I will never be trying a recipe from that book. [laughs] It's funny how I used to think it was my dream job. Now, I don't know. It's funny, I'm sort of in awe of my dad. Sayin' no, this chapter is over, and... walking away to start a new one. I just don't know what I would do. You used to know exactly what you wanted to do. [simultaneously] Young adult literacy. [laughs] [simultaneously] Jinx! Well, you know, maybe you need to start from the beginning. Try a new path. If only I knew what that was. ♪ Hey! [gasps] What are you doing?! What are you doing? You scared me! I scared you? You... you stormed in here like some kind of tactical response team. Yeah, 'cause you were in here waving a flashlight around like you were trying to steal things. It's because I didn't want anyone storming in here 'cause they thought I was stealing things. [sighs] You okay? I will be once my heart rate returns to normal. Wait, how did you get in here? Oh, the... the back gym door has one of those push button locks. They haven't changed the combination in decades. [laughs] [sighs] Well, what are you doing here? Well, I wanted to, uh, you know, decorate Coach's classroom for his retirement. What are you doing here? Same. I uh, found some pictures of him when he was coaching and playing. Oh. And, I made this. Lots of it. It's... it's, uh, little footballs. Cool. I, uh, I have some streamers. Oh, well uh, what's that? This is... Hmm? "We love you Coach Kerrigan." Yeah, well. You know? We do. We do indeed. Oh, uh... [clears throat] Wanna help me with something? Sure. You might want to grab that end. Okay. And up... [laughs] It's great. Thank you. [whispers] Come here. What? What? What? What? Hey! I was saving that for later. Shh! I can't believe he still gets out of bed at 0500 every morning. That's why he falls asleep on the sofa every night? [clock alarm beeps] Go, go, go! Wow. It's gonna take me forever to clean up this mess. Oh, it's okay. [sighs] Good morning. Oh, hi. Hey, someone went crazy in your dad's classroom last night. I wonder who that could be. I wonder. [laughs] It meant the world to him. Miss Alice, could I ask you something? Did you mind me coming here every day after school? Just, after my mom passed, the house was so empty, and coming here and escaping into a book, it meant everything to me. Looking back, I don't know, I wonder if maybe it felt like you were babysitting me. Do you remember my nephew, Tyler? He was about six or seven years older than you? Oh, yeah, he's on, uh, he's on Wall Street now, right? Yes, he is, but... he was on a much different street when he was going here. So, my sister made a deal with him. She said "you can keep your friends, "you can do whatever you want, "as long as you play three sports. "Football, baseball, and basketball." All the sports my dad coached. Correct. Took about a month, Tyler started saying "sir," doing his chores again. Your dad has a way of turning kids around like that. So, your letting me stay here was like paying my dad back? No... no, that's... that's what friends do. [laughs] That's... we help each other, any way we can. And, for the record, missy, having you in this library made me as happy as it made you. [crows cawing] [out of breath] Race to the finish! Yeah, whoa, ah! I'm gonna have to tell everyone for the next 60-70 years that I beat, uh, big Jake Gillette in a foot race. [laughs] No problem. So, anyway, uh, well Sam and I both lost our moms early on. The difference was, Sam had Coach. My dad, well, I was just a little too much for him to handle, so he left me with his mom, my nana. And then at football camp, I just... I latched onto coach. Of course, I fell immediately in love with Samantha. Took me ten years to convince her to love me back. Three years to mess it all up. Well, what about now? What about now? I mean, she's made it pretty clear that she's moved on. Well, sure, but, um, I know for a fact she's not seeing anyone. Hello. Are... are you okay? Yeah. Hi. I'm Samantha. Sage. Hi Sage. What are you reading? Uh, it's for freshman English. We have to read a new book every month. You don't like it? It's a classic. It's classically boring. I'm halfway through, and it's all about getting some rich guy to be your husband, so you're well-off. Yeah well, times were different then. What kind of books do you like? I don't. Okay, well, what kind of movies do you like? Adventure, fantasy worlds, you know, weird stuff like that. That's not weird at all, I actually love those too. People created entire worlds and invited you to come and visit. Here, try these. I love them all. Hmm. Come on, give me that top one. Look. See, there is my name right there from where I took out this actual book. Yikes, that's like 50 years ago. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Hm-mmm. Okay. I'll try them. I mean, it can't be worse than "gazing into the garden, dreaming of a man of means." [gasps] Oh, don't scare me like that. [laughs] I need you to come with me. What? Where? Come on, let's go. Get your coat. Oh... Come on. But I... Okay. Come on, come on, come on. So you're kidnapping me? Yes. For lunch. That's right. Should I, uh, should I be leaving a trail of breadcrumbs? Maybe. [laughs] I forgot about these woods. Happy to see that every tree is exactly where I left it. Yeah, I love it. Come back here whenever I visit. I didn't know you came to visit my dad so often. Well, I think Coach didn't know how to bring it up without upsetting you, so... In accordance with the male rules for avoiding awkward conversations, he just, uh, didn't say anything. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Our first kiss, under that tree. A million years ago. Yeah. What? It's weird, I remember every detail about our first kiss. Yeah, me too. I don't remember anything about our last kiss. Maybe that's because it hasn't happened yet. Hmm. [laughs] Is that our treehouse? What have you done to it? Well, last time I was visiting, Coach and I gave it a, uh, little facelift. Facelift? It's like you rebuilt the whole thing. [laughs] There's a picnic basket up here. Well, that would be the lunch part. [laughs] A winter picnic. It's different. Well, you know, I've always been a rebel. [laughs] I stopped by the school today. Miss Alice said Dad loved the decorations. Good. I'm glad. Wanna hear something weird? Always. I met this girl there named Sage. That's not weird, Sage is a nice name. Stop. [laughs] Sage needed a... a book for class but she hates reading. Also, not weird. Slightly tragic, but... Sorry. Go on. So I recommended a few books, and we were looking at the checkout card, and my name was still on one of them. Okay, tha... that is weird. Right? Yeah. I mean, there were only four names on the card, and these are really good books. People really should be reading them. And they haven't, not for years. So I was thinking about what you said, about going back to the beginning. So, what are you thinking? I don't know. I mean, with my work, I... I have all these connections with these amazing young adult authors. Most of them self-publish, because traditional publishing companies like mine are too afraid to take a risk. I was wondering if there was some way that I could, I don't know, bring them together. Ahhh... Like if there wasn't strength in numbers or something. I don't know, I'm still thinking about it. In the meantime, I should probably get back to the house and do some real work. Right. Those brussels sprout recipes are calling my name. Yeah. [clears throat uncomfortably] ♪ All right, little man. Remember, keep your pointer finger on that seam. There you go. The other fingers on the laces. Perfect. Now, left foot forward and... hit me in the end-zone. Oh, touch down! And the crowd goes wild! [imitates cheering] Nice. There you go. All right, you got it. Just gotta keep on practicing. All right? Nice to meet you, folks. Hey. Hey. Wanna see what I got Diana's baby? Oh, do I. His name is Squeakers. Isn't he adorable? [laughs] You're gonna be one of those aunts that just spoils 'em rotten, aren't you? That is my exact plan. What do you got in your bags? I got... a football onesie. Huh? You just used the word onesie in a sentence. Hey, don't judge me there, Miss Squeaker. [laughs] Hey, could I ask you a question? Absolutely not. You think you're getting burnt out? Maybe a little. I mean, not with the game. I love everything about the game, but the rest of it, the fame? I thought you loved that. I did, but you were right, it's not real. You know me. A part of me would be comfortable saying "buy this truck because, well, I think it's swell." [laughs] I do it because there's bills to pay. You know, Lenny, my manager, he's a... he's a really good guy and he's a machine when it comes to money, which is great. But, I just find myself stuck in my apartment and my hotel because I... can't even go out to buy a sandwich without drawing a huge crowd. And, he's positioning me to do even more of it. You know, TV spots, commercials. [simultaneously] Clink! I know this should be my dream, but it isn't. I feel like your dad's trying to coach me one last time, to know when to close one book and open the next. Wait, what did you say? Okay, I used the book metaphor to impress you. No, not that. Before that, about the crowds. Always, everywhere. [laughs] I gotta call Diana. We've gotta go. To where? To the library. I'm not sure what you mean by that. [laughing] I'm joking. Oh, my. Oh, you're both... here. Uh, yeah, I uh, I was just doing some cleaning up in my classroom, and... Jake! Oh my, I didn't see you there. Gosh! It's great to see ya. Good to see you too. All right. Why'd we all get the SOS text? Well, this library was my favourite place in the world growing up. You know, that's not exactly breaking news. [all laughing] Hurts my heart to see it sitting here empty. So that's why I need your help. We're gonna restore the library. That's a great idea, but... But what are you thinking? We're gonna have an open house. Ohhh! Before the Snow Bowl game. Ah! Like an indoor tailgating party. We'll have hot chocolate, and food before the game. Okay... We'll spruce the place up, we can decorate. Yeah, you know, I know where we can get some streamers, too. Oh, yeah, I heard what happened to your classroom. That's weird. We can get some new pillows, put up some new posters, and we'll take donations at the front door. Ah, it's... it's a lovely idea, honey. Um, I just don't think a tailgate party at the library sounds like much fun. But how does "Tailgate with Jake" sound? Mmm. If you're okay with it. No pressure. So, you want me to use my power for good? Eh, yeah, why not? Really? If you think people will come. Yes, they will come, because you're asking them to come, because you're a hometown hero, and if you say the library's important, they'll be here. She's right, I mean, I'll even show up the night before just to make sure I get in. Well, how about this? Every $5 donated gets a raffle ticket, we'll pull a raffle at the Snow Bowl, and the winner will get a football signed by Coach and yours truly. That's great. [laughs] This is wonderful. Okay, so Boss, when do we start? Right now. Diana, do you think you could come up with a flyer for the event and put it all over town, especially in the storefronts? I can do that. Great. And Graham... Do you think you could write an article for the newspaper and maybe get them to put it on their website, too? I am on it. And the rest of us, come on. We got work to do. He gave up endorsement money for this?! Looks like we're going tailgating. Okay. I am gonna head home and make a dozen new pillows for the nook, perfect use for all my leftover fabric. And I'm going shopping, I got hot chocolate, hot dogs, buns, mustard and relish, I can handle this. And I make a great vegetable soup we can sell. I'll text you my list. Perfect. Let me guess, "50 Hot Soups for a Cold Winters' Day?" How many of our cookbooks have you bought? [embarrassed] All of them. Seriously? Yeah, of course, they're yours, you know? I wanted to support you. Wow. You know, and you joke, but there's a lobster bisque recipe in there that a freight train would take a dirt road for. [laughs] What? I don't even know what that means. But you know, once we do this, the whole world's gonna know you're here. No more hiding out. I'll just escape to my treehouse. They'll never find me there. Aww. [phone buzzes] Um... Umm, excuse me. [clears throat] Hello? Jake, buddy. Lenny. I thought you were taking a break. Wow, that was fast. I get it, you want to do something for your old school. Let me work on how to spin this. There's no "spin," Lenny. It's for a good cause and I'm having fun. Fun? Yeah, fun. Jake, this is your life. You're not supposed to be having fun. [under his breath] Oh, my... That didn't come out the way it was supposed to. Lenny? Yeah, Jake buddy? Everything's good. Don't worry about it. But I just... [call drops] Aw, Jake. [loud slam] There you are. Oh. I love that you organized all this. Well, it's easy when you're doing something you enjoy. Mm. I can't do cookbooks, Jake. Not anymore. I know. You found your passion, it's right here. It's this library. I mean, maybe I couldn't find it out there because it was right here all along, just waiting for me. I have to do something more than a tailgating party, though. There's gotta be something else. Hello? I saw the light on. Oh... Oh, you're here. I'm here. So what's the verdict? They're awesome. When Calinda summoned the dragon? Right. And she doesn't see that Xerxes is there? I was dying. This is my kind of love story. Wanna know the best part? What? Each one of those is the first book in a series. Are you kidding? Nope, this is one of five, that's a trilogy, and this one, there's like 15 of them, and the author is still writing. 15? I can't wait to read them. They just keep getting better, too. Seven's my favourite. Wow, Diana really papered the town. Yeah. Hey, you, uh, mind if we take a little detour before we go to the bonfire? Sure. Ahh... Nana's old house. Looks great. New family really fixed it up. Yeah, Coach says they have a little girl who just started school this year. I bet she has your room. [laughs] It's hard to imagine it decorated with anything other than trophies and posters of Brett Farve and Darrell Green. And that lime green rug. [laughs] I forgot about the rug. You miss it? The rug, no, no. I installed lime green shag in every room in my condo, so, you know, I'm good. [laughs] First day of football camp, I was a skinny kid who couldn't sit still for more than 20 seconds. They put a football helmet on me and I looked like a bobble-head toy. [laughs] It wasn't until a few years later that I found out that Coach had called Nana and suggested that I come out to camp, at no cost. Maybe he saw your natural talent. Nah. I think he was just doing a kindness for a woman in a tough spot. That changed my life. I wish I could help kids like that. Well, you do that football camp in the summer. My dad told me you organized the whole program in the city. I think that's amazing. Yeah, well I mean those kids are great, but each session is only a week. I mean, as soon as I start to get to know 'em, it's over. I just wish I could do more, like Coach did. Is that smoke? (Both) The bonfire. Let's go. Wish time. All right, thank you. Ah, ah, no cheating. Let me see. No. It won't come true. Who made up that rule? It's always been a rule. No, it hasn't. Okay, then. Show me yours. No. Uh-huh. Uh-uh. Uh-huh. Uh-uh. Are you ready? Ready. Yeah. Ready? Yep. There. Now our wishes are on their way up into the cosmos, where they can come true. [sighs happily] Speaking of wishes coming true. Hmm? Can we talk about my Dad and Alice? I can neither confirm nor deny. I have been sworn to secrecy, my lips are... sealed. [laughs] I don't even know what you're talking about. Alice who? ♪ You know, I think I should try one of these. Ah. In... in the interest of quality control. Okay, one. One only. We need to save them for the tailgating party. Mmm. So, have you thought about retiring too? That lake is calling us both. Yeah, no, I know it's beautiful. But I'm not exactly ready yet. Not until that library's full of happy students. You know, we gotta tell Samantha about us eventually. Ahhh. No. Hey, it's been going on long enough. Not yet. She's got enough to deal with. I just don't want to upset her. What makes you think she would be upset? She thinks you're great. You're her dad. She's not happy about us, she'll get over it. She'll still love you. But I might lose her forever, and then maybe I'd lose you too if it came down to it. It's not gonna happen like that. Okay, I... I just don't want her to think that... I'm trying to replace her mother. So, please? Give me a little more time? That's fair enough. Now, let's pack up these cookies. Put it back. ♪ Darn it. [knocking at door] Goodnight, sweetie. 'Night, Dad. Love you. I love you too. Sleep tight. ♪ [knocking] Come on! Come on! Wake up! Get up! Get up! Come ooooooon! [groaning] Ow! [laughs] What? What? What happened? Nothing. I'm kidnapping you. What? It's my turn to kidnap you. Come on, let's go. Okay, just um... Give me, give me, give me five minutes. You get three. ♪ Our hill. Yeah, Graham and I were just up here, actually. Did you tell him about our many failed attempts to sled to the bottom of the tree-line? I did. [sighs] I think we could make it now. Probably. I know you haven't put on any weight since high school. Ah. I put on a few pounds. Of muscle, maybe. Hm. You know, in retrospect, sledding as fast as we can, trying to hit trees probably wasn't such a good idea. And you brought the toboggan. All waxed up and ready to go. Yay. [sighs] Come on, let's do it. Come on, it's Snowcoming, it's all about second chances. [sighs] Yeah, I totally got this, huh? You totally got this. Hmm. Okay... You ready? I was born ready. I mean, maybe not, but, let's do it anyway. Okay, here we go. [screams] [laughing] [groans] You okay? That was awesome! Why did you do that? We almost went into the trees. 'Cause we almost ran into the trees! Yeah, but it was super fun until we crashed. Yeah. You wanna do it again? No, no, I do not wanna do it again. It was dangerous, we could've gotten hurt. Says the man who routinely faces a metric ton of linebackers. We're professionals. Are you saying I am not a professional tobogganer? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. Huh. Yeah. What? Don't. You. Dare. You'll regret it. Will I? Mm. Hmm. Samantha. Samantha? Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. [laughs] Get it! [laughing] [clears throat] What did you wish for at the bonfire? Those pictures in your necklace, hmm? We should probably go back. Why? It's still really early. I had an idea last night. I just want to check my emails. So, I was thinking about all the authors that I've contacted through work. The ones who are self-publishing. Mm-hmm. And I thought, what if they would give one or two of their books to libraries, at a discounted rate? Like, super discounted. So, I targeted all of the authors that I knew wrote series, and I asked them for just the first book, for our library and for other libraries. Because, if a kid loves a book, they're gonna read it over and over again. And, they're going to buy all the other books in the series, which is a win for the author, but also a win for us. I just want to see if any of them emailed me back. [laughs] Sam, it looks like some of them definitely emailed you back. [laughs] Look at this. I've got 200 authors who are interested. So, if we make money at the tailgate party tomorrow, that means we might be able to buy one book from each of them at the discounted rate. Nice. Plus, I've been reaching out to other libraries, and they all want in too, 'cause they're all having the same problems that we have. They've got no money, and the donations that they are getting are terrible. I mean, they've got 40-year-old textbooks, paperbacks that are missing pages, and magazines so old that they're speculating whether Charles and Di are having marital problems. So, what I think I need to do is just make a list of people that I think cou... Why am I dressed like this? [grunts] [laughs] [laughter] Ah, you were right, this is cathartic. [laughs] What? I miss that laugh. I miss being with someone who makes me laugh. All right. All right. I gotta go make my world-famous soup. You comin'? Only 'cause there's nothing I like more than watching someone else cook. Let's see how much you like it when I leave the dishes for you to clean. What? No. I am not signing up for that. [laughs] Come on. [phone rings] Hey. Hey. So, anything you want to tell me about Jake and you? Nope. Nothing? Nothing to tell. Girl, the lies you tell. Anyway, listen, the whole school is buzzing about Snowcoming Tailgate with Jake, so make sure he makes loads of soup. I think we're going to be okay. And whatever your dad is grilling, tell him to get twice as much. I'm on it. And, what did you do to Sage Abernathy? Sage? Nothing. Nothing? Three days ago, Sage wouldn't read the back of a cereal box. Yesterday, I had to physically take her book away from her so she would stop reading it under the desk. She's an awesome kid. And you're an awesome mentor. Sage is the first kid in your literacy campaign. Student No. 1. Wow. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, actually, it is. Talk to you later. Okay, bye. [laughs] Your soup smells very good, but we're going to need a lot of people to show up or we're going to be eating it for a month. Oh, there's gonna be so many people we're going to run out. You watch. Okay. So, I was able to find graham crackers. Nice. And marshmallows, though I have no idea how old these are. You know the half-life is a hundred years. True. [laughs] Got a chocolate bar. Ooh, did you... Why would you doubt me? For the man who likes peanut butter cups in his s'mores. Told you. I'm a rebel. Here. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. So. Can I tell you something crazy? Crazier than us sitting here making s'mores again? [chuckles] Yeah, even crazier than that. Tell me. Well, my contract is up this year, and I don't know if they're going to keep me, trade me, or completely cut me loose. Are you kidding? Nope. You're at the peak of your career. Why would they trade you? Peak or not, I am getting older. I'm tired. Tired of football. Never thought I'd hear you say that. I... I still love the game, I will forever, but uh, you know, my body's getting tired. I make those old man noises when I get up in the morning. [laughs] I took a really hard hit last year. Oh yeah, I saw that. What? I was channel surfing. I just... happened to see it. Uh-huh? Anyway, it freaked me out a little bit. I dunno. Thinking about walking away. Really? You? I know. Insane, right? But, when I allow myself to consider the idea, I really like it. I want to leave on my terms, you know? My decision. I don't want to be a piece in someone else's chess board. You still like your marshmallow crispy, right? Of course. Good. Oooooh. For you. Thank you. There you go. To new beginnings. To starting over. [simultaneously] Clink. Mmm. Right there, that's perfect. And all the lighter colours, let's put on that there. It's looking good, you guys. Okay, let's get it together here. [crowd chattering] [laughs] I got your text, what's happening? I don't know, we got a call from Miss Alice to come now and use the back door. What's wrong? Look. We need to get set up right away. Oh. Maybe we should open up early. Absolutely. Dad, hot dogs. Graham, can you set up the drink station? Miss Alice, can you get the soup prepped? Diana, let's get the raffle table set up. Jake? Mmm. These are delicious. Is that... is that nutmeg I'm tasting? Yeah. I add it at the end. Well, it gives a nice little kick. Sorry. [clears throat] [crowd chattering] Are you opening early? Yes. Ah, in one minute and we will be taking donations and selling raffle tickets right here. When will Jake Gillette be here? You know, I heard he was already here. [crowd cheers] Good morning everyone. Thank you all for coming. Hi Jake. Um, thank you. Thank you all for coming. You know, uh, my school's library was always one of my favourite places growing up. Outside the end zone of course. [crowd laughs] And I'm very passionate about supporting literacy through our library, not only here in my very own hometown, but also across our country. I'm especially excited to promote a new literacy program piloted in our very own library, and we hope that the money that we raise today will go a long way towards supporting the program. Jake, I have a few questions. One moment please. So... Who is that? Beats me, but I don't like her. ...we'll pull a raffle right after the Snow Bowl. All right. Thanks everybody. For every $5 donated, we get one raffle ticket? Yep, and 5 for 20. Jake, do you think you'll be traded? Can you comment on the rumours? Oh, and why are you hiding in your hometown? Thanks for all the questions, Cassie, but, uh, today is about Coach Kerrigan and today is about Snowcoming. Everything else can wait. Thank you. ♪ Oh, hey guys. Thanks. I'm glad you could come. A lot of people. (All) Cheese! [happy chattering] ♪ Oh, there you go. Good going, sweetie. Nice work, guys. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Jake, buddy. Lenny, um, what are you doing here? I came up here to support you. That's so sweet of you. Hey, whatever you want me to do, let me know. Well, Cassie Carnes is here. You think you can run a little interference? Why? I don't see the problem. You're getting some great press. She doesn't want a story, she wants a scandal, and she's not above starting one. Oh. [laughs] Gotcha. Hey. Hey! Okay, tell me the truth? Always. Yes. Yes, it's a slow start, but stick with it. Definitely. Put that one on top. Cool. I'm so glad you work here now. Oh, um, I don't work... Excuse me, um, you're Coach Kerrigan's daughter, aren't you? Um, Samantha, yes. And you are? Oh, Cassie Carnes. So nice to finally meet you, I know coach has been a big influence in Jake's life. Um, yes, they've always been very close. Any insight into Jake's plans for next year? He wouldn't talk to me about that, I don't know anything. Oh. That's not what I hear. I heard you two dated for years. Um, here we go. That was a long time ago. Of course, it was. I mean, a guy like Jake can date any woman he wants to date, live anywhere he wants to live, it's really sweet that he's doing all of this for the library and for your dad, you know, but he's got a plane ticket booked out of here tonight. Uh... He didn't tell you? Oh yeah, he's leaving right after your dad's ceremony. Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. What brings you up? Lenny, long time. Good to see you again, what brings you up here? Oh, you know, just trying to get a little info on the trade. What trade? Oh? Have you heard something about a trade? ♪ Hey, coffee, yes. Hey, Coach. You, uh, seen Samantha? Uh, no, not for a while. I think she's probably back there helping people find books. Hey, Graham. Oh, back for seconds, are we? You need me to take over, Coach? Yeah, we're almost done here and I gotta get over to that crazy Snow Bowl game. I'm gonna see you over there, right? Yeah, sure. All right. Hey, do you know why Samantha left? I mean, did we run out of something? Wait, she left? Yeah, yeah. 20 minutes ago. Coach, can you comment on Jake's plans for next year? Sorry. [sighs] Hey, Graham, uh, you mind if I borrow your keys? Yeah, no problem. Thanks, bud. Cheers. You're gonna love this. Oh. Jake, just a couple of questions for you. If you have a minute. Samantha? Sam? [sighs] ♪ Hey. Hey. Ah... look... We've been here before, Jake. Same place, it's déjà vu all over again. They manipulate me to get to you. Now I'm older and way more stubborn, so this time we're gonna talk. I'm gonna make you hear me, so stand there and listen. Do you remember when we were in middle school and I was sad and skinny and lots of kids picked on me? You were always sticking up for me. And in high school, I was the quarterback. We won the division, and all the same people suddenly wanted to be my best friend. And you'd smack me around and tell me that they only liked me because of what I could do, not who I am. Maybe I was just looking for an excuse to smack you around. And then we went to college, and the same thing happened, but you loved me in a different way, so... this time it hurt. Sam, this is the exact same thing, just on a bigger scale. People latch onto me because I can throw a football, but they have no idea who I am. Cassie. Cassie is a reporter. She wants a story. But more than anything, she wants to be there when they announce that I've been traded so she can get a picture of me looking devastated. Jake, I can't do this again. I can't compete with this. There's no competition. It's you, Samantha. I've always loved you. I didn't know how to tell you. Do you really have a plane ticket out of here today? Are you leaving? Yes. But only because I have a meeting with the team owners, that's it. [sighs] It's all some walk down memory lane for you? Absolutely not. Look, I'm going down to the Snow Bowl game. They asked me to present your dad with an award. Please come. I want you to see something. [upbeat music] ♪ [cheering] [applause] [laughing] Hey! Hey, I was starting to worry. All right good game! Good game! Good game! All right! [cheering] Thank you for that wonderful Snow Bowl game. [cheering] While the rules were vague at best, the spirit and enthusiasm were truly inspiring. And now, it's time for our raffle from the library tailgating party. And to draw the winning ticket for the signed football... Jake Gillette! [cheering] All right, so who wants to win this football? [cheering] Let's see... [hums a tune] ♪ [crowd laughs] Oh! Ah. Uh, Sage Abernathy! [cheering and applause] There we go. Nice catch. Do you think you could teach me how to throw a spiral? I absolutely can. [applause] Aw, you gotta love that. Now, for some sad news, by now you've all heard our beloved Coach is gonna be retiring. So for one last time, let's give a big hometown round of applause to Coach Kerrigan. [cheering and applause] Yeah Couch, whoo!!! Thank you, thank you. As anybody who's played on one of my teams knows, I'm not the kind of man that likes to listen to his own voice, but... [audience laughs] I'd just like to thank everybody who supported me for all these years. I couldn't have picked a better town to raise my daughter in. [cheering] We love you, Coach! Thank you. One minute, Coach. You know, you won a lot of trophies for us. So we had one made for you. Coach, on behalf of all the students you taught, the teams you coached, the parents you supported, and the townspeople you love. Thank you. [cheering and applause] Thank you. What's he doing? One final announcement. I don't know. While I wish the coach all the best in his retirement, as you can imagine, he's left some pretty big shoes to fill. But this week, we were approached by a fine candidate, and I am pleased to announce we were able to extend an offer. Congratulations. You're going to be a great coach. [cheering and applause] Aw, Jake buddy. What are you doing? Yes! [cheering and applause] You are not gonna believe this. Ohh! He's our new coach, people! What do you think? [cheering and applause] [laughing] Brother. Ahh. [laughs] -All right, we'll see you guys. -Yes. Take care. Jake, buddy. Are you ready for me to talk some sense into you now? Lenny, thank you for everything you've done, and I fully intend on honouring the commitments you've made so far but then I'm done. Just give me an hour or so to wrap up here, and you can give me a lift to the airport, huh? All right, I'll do that. Jake... I'm gonna talk you out of this. I know you'll try. You know I will. So, anything new in your life? [laughs] I have a question for you. They hire you as the coach, you know, they're still going to have to find a teacher. No, they aren't. My degree is in education. I, uh, I am a teacher. Seriously? What do you think I majored in? I don't know, the mechanics of how to throw a spiral? Sweat sock repair? [laughs] Really? You... you're going there? [laughs] No, you're... you're gonna be great. You're always great. You know, I'm coming home, Sam, but it's not going to be home without you here, too. [sighs] It sounds wonderful, Jake. It really does. But I can't go from being the old coach's daughter to the new coach's girlfriend. I have to find my own way, too. We can work it out together. [phone vibrates] You gonna get that? Seriously, you of all people are asking me that? It's my dad, he wants to know if we'll meet him at the library before you head out of town. You got time? Barely, but come on, let's go. Okay. I know. I didn't expect it at all. Ah, so there you guys are. What's going on? Oh, well, we just added up all the donations, and we have more than enough money for the renovations for the library and the tech centre. And with your literacy program, we have hundreds of new books coming in. That is terrific news. Yes, it is. I have more news. I'm going to retire. And I want you to come home and take over the library, and launch your literacy program right from here. Oh. Wow. Um, I'll think about it. Okay. Don't think too long. Just maybe say yes and make us all happy. Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Yes, of course! Thank you! Awesome! Oh, and, uh, one other thing. You know, for, uh, a long time, it's been you and me against the world, and I'm really proud of the woman you've become, and I'm, you know I just think you've been a wonderful daughter. But wouldn't you know it, I fell in love with this... this wonderful woman. We're going to get married. I can't believe you two. I can't believe it took you this long to tell me. [laughs] You knew? Of course I knew. You guys aren't exactly subtle. I'm so happy for both of you. Can I help plan the wedding? Oh yes, and please be my Maid of Honour. Of course, of course.
