Six I will try to take you out Especially Hong Yulan Why? Hurry She's the reason why Zhang and myself ...risked our lives by staying here Let me tell you about what our comrades have done Three months ago We've received news that the Japanese troops... have robbed a pile of gold bars from the banks in cities occupied by them They planned to ship the gold to Japan The Government has ordered three teams One was headed by Yulan's husband, Yisheng To get back the gold Unfortunately, during the shooting Both the enemy and our men have killed all except Yisheng who was badly injured He tried with his best and moved the gold inside a cave nearby After he had hidden the gold... Then he hurried back to the base And sent a telegram out So that others will take care of the gold When he was sending the telegram The Japanese troops arrived Yisheng was killed... in an encounter with them When he was about to die... He didn't finish sending out the telegram regarding the hiding place of gold So he told his wife Hong Yulan But Yulan had a shock... when the Japanese was hitting her She couldn't remember a thing now Our mission is to... try to get Yulan out as soon as possible We must locate the gold... and transport it all back to our base Hong Yulan is a brave, strong woman We all are All our fellow countrymen are If this was your country Would you do the same? Of course Because we are patriots That's why we'll risk our lives It's late, you should head back I want to tell you something Thank you for saving my life Why did you let them go? Cui Guodong is right We haven't found out who their leader is If we kill them now They can always organize another group If we free them and spy on them They could lead us to the gold You should have told me first I'm head of security here I'm in charge here I can make any decision It's important You shouldn't have listened to an interpreter That... Cui Guodong is Chinese But he's an orphan He has been raised by Japanese I've always treated him as Japanese Fine But I won't take any responsibility in this Commander, a telegram It's prisoner no. 372 of Camp 8 Hurry and get to the bottom of this Report to me soon I'll take care of it No...

He's a spy That's right He works for the Chinese government Damn, shoot him now Guard Commander. Wait At least for the sake of gold... I plan to keep Cui Guodong alive Why? Because his mission... is to gain back possession of the gold bars So, has that female prisoner confessed? Fine, you'll take care of it Right away, sir Yes Hey, come out Where did you get all those cigarettes? From the Mako You're shameless Taking favors from the enemy Have got to beat some sense into you You useless cow Enough, Elizabeth Come over and help Jennifer Cui Guodong, I'm right here Jennifer, how's Hong Yulan?

Underneath the falls I think she might have found out who the spy is And she got killed Don't tell them yet Because I haven't found out ...who the real spy is What do we do? The troops will catch up shortly I must divert them You take Hong Yulan and the others ...to the White Cloud Peak But there're so many of them How can you handle them all? I've already contacted the guerrillas They'll be waiting for me Guess it should be alright But you should be very careful Because any of them could be ...the real spy!

I can't quite remember What cave? Wait Cui Guodong risked his life and got us ...out here on one condition You know that, don't ya? What condition? He wants to help Hong Yulan out Because they are patriots They want to get back the gold that's why they worked undercover I asked him to take you along There must be plenty of gold We've struck gold No, the gold isn't private property We can?t just take it That's right, it belongs to our country It's for buying weapons to resist the Japanese Where is the gold?
