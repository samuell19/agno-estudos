Hello. Do you remember, my dear? That you used to fancy this chocolate? It's been almost 50 years. You gave me this same chocolate. That's right! That's exactly right. It's been that long since I gave you the same chocolate. When we got married, we were so happy like this. To this day, we still have fun together and love each other more than ever. Am I right? This is what I love about being a tour guide here. This city never fails to create memories that can always make you happy. Give me soju, please. I truly believe in the magic of this city because I experienced it myself a couple of years ago. Your costume is cute, and it suits you very well. Thank you. A heart is supposed to depict happiness and not be alone and sad like this. But I like being alone. You look really cute right now. Speak for yourself. Really? Yes, really. Jun-ho? I have something to tell you. Jun-ho... I love you. Jun-ho, where are you? I thought we were supposed to meet now. You've promised me. You forgot? Are you kidding me? Today is our anniversary, how could you forget? BOX OF LUCK My name is Diah. I try to be my own life's tour guide. Sometimes, life might seem very dark, but I believe that you can always find small things that can make you smile. And those small things might even come as a surprise. Hi, dear? Got it, let's not fight anymore. Thanks for the surprise. Take care, my dear. Don't forget to call me. Nick. Hey. My friend. Come here, Nick. -How are you, man? -I'm good. Here, I already ordered for you! Where's your girl? -What? -Your girlfriend! -You mean my fiancée? -Fiancée? She's at a beauty salon. When she's done, I'll tell her to come. Fiancée? Where's your girlfriend? She's supposed to arrive soon. But wait a minute. This is the first time you've had a girlfriend that you never introduced to me. And suddenly, you are engaged! What kind of best friend are you? Maybe this is what it's called true love. Here we go again with your over the top romanticism. How long have you been with this girl? Well, it's quite long. Two weeks, I guess? Man. You're not Gary if you don't keep changing girls. Come on. But let me tell you that this time it's different. Because I have a feeling, that this one will be the end of my journey. It's the sign for the end of the world. -Are you hypnotized? -You haven't heard anything! Here she is. This is my miracle-worker! Kristie? -What's up, babe? -No, it's nothing. Hello? Garry! Do you have any idea where I am? Please do tell this to my ex-fiancée, my beloved ex-fiancée. Tell her this, my man. Tell her that I've happily moved on... I am now happy! Just see... I will move on from you... Even though goodbye is not as simple as that. How dare you run over my ex's photograph. Why are you following me? I understand you can't wait to prep all the things needed for the wedding... But have you even set the date? What if he postpones it again? You should check with-- Please, who's getting married here? Yes, I know. I'm just worried about you. I don't want you to be disappointed again. All right then. As long as you're happy. Yes, thank you. Look at the time! Aren't we supposed to go now? Oh, goodness! Let's go! Ma'am, does this dress please you? Are you going to proceed with this order? If we proceed with the order and the alterations, how much would be the total? It's about 320, 000 won. Perhaps, your sister is right. Don't you think it would be such a waste of money to spend on the dress? We can't be so sure when you will use it. Please include the shipping cost. I'll take it! So, how is it? Do you want some more food? Diah, I couldn't even finish this. Such a famous kid! Are they already waiting for you? Oh, no! You're right. They all arrived early. Go then, you can't make them wait. Are you sure? -Yes, it's okay. -Are you sure? Go ahead! We'll spend the whole day together next time! Okay. Take care! -I'll head first. -Bye! Come bloom! You're not a bonsai! The sun is striking hot don't be lazy! Here! Let me shower you. Excuse me. Hello! Hello! Here's a letter for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, earlier today, Jun-ho gave me a surprise letter. He asked me to go out for a dinner. Well, I'm waiting for him now. All right, I have to go! I got to fix my makeup. He'll arrive anytime soon now. Okay? It's too cold. It's so delicious. Diah. Calm down, Diah. Now, count from one to ten before you act. I’ll explain everything. The hell is with you, you piece of shit! My sister is right, you will only disappoint me. And you! What kind of best friend stabs you from behind? You said you're postponing our wedding because you are busy. As it turns out, you are busy with another girl! I should've seen this coming. I never knew you could disappoint me this much. That day, it was our anniversary. Have you really forgotten? Or did you intentionally forget it? I haven't changed. I still have my heart with me. But you? Where did you hide your heart? That night, my life was in the hand of a banana. The one and only Banana with a heart. Hey. Banana! One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Ten. This is your last chance. Diah. I am really sorry. It's all my fault. -I can do it alone. -Okay. Thank you very much. Diah, why haven't you replied to me? So how was yesterday with Jun-ho? Come on, tell me! I'm so curious! Diah, I just called Jun-ho and he told me that you guys are not together anymore. He tried to reach you too, but you didn't answer. I am worried because I haven't heard anything from you. Please answer my call immediately. I am going to book a flight to go to you. I know that you're still sad. I took a leave, so that I can accompany you there. Is your address still the same? I can purchase a flight scheduled the day after tomorrow. Will you be at home? Hello? Yes. My phone was malfunctioning. It's still being fixed. I'm trying to keep myself busy. It's easier to move on like that. Yes, I'm fine! You don't have to come over. Okay? I love you too! Turn a little bit to the left. All right, here we are. The floor is elevated. Be careful of your steps. Thank you very much. Who's there? Hello, good morning! Holy mother of God! Can we just speak in Bahasa instead? How do you know I'm an Indonesian? Most of Indonesian have the habit of parroting. Well, I just wanted to give you the food I just made. But I'm not a charity box. Hello, good morning! Why do you keep coming back? Do you want to rob me? Why are you so grumpy? You can't hate something you don't know. Let me introduce myself. My name is Nik! I'm Diah. I just want to talk to you. Hey, Diah don't go! I brought you fried bananas, Diah. They're really sweet! Perhaps you need something sweet, to sweeten your sour face. Hey, Diah! Good morning! Diah, time to wake up! Wake up, the chickens are calling already! Diah? Diah? What else do you want? Today, I cooked a lot of sweetmeats! I want you to try it. Don't worry, this isn't a leftover. Just so you know. I'm an expert when it comes to sweetmeat! Oh, right. I need to take the containers from yesterday. I'm sure they're all spoiled already. Just take it! You're the one who left them there anyway. I need to ask your permission because I don't want you to think I'm a robber. Why do you keep coming back here? I don't care about your cooking! I told you to find another friend. Why would you waste your time with a blind girl? You all have started to turn into zombies. "Turn to what handsome guy?" Turn to what, you say? Hey, Diah! I just watered your plants. They all seem to be bored with life. Who told you to do that? Well, no one did. What you said to me yesterday was right. I am stupid, and I couldn't even cook properly. I came here just to befriend you. But if you don't want to, that's all right. Thank you for your time. I'm going to take my leave now. Hold on! Yes? I apologize for the things that I had said the other day. I couldn't sleep last night. What you said was horrible. I know. Well, I think it's better if we don't talk anymore. Oh, no. Don't say that! We can still talk. Since you have apologized, I'm all right now. By the way, I have brought you seaweed soup. To prove that it's not poisonous, I'm going to eat with you. As the saying goes, "It's through your intestine, through your large intestine." What? Have you heard about that? The man can prove to himself through her intestines! What you mean to say is, "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." Yes, that's right! That's what I mean. It's good! It's been a while since I had seaweed soup. Hey, I just want to check. Are you getting sick because of the food? I'll disappear right away if you're poisoned. I don't think so, not yet. But we'll find out about it later. Maybe in the evening, or tomorrow when it takes effect. Maybe it's still in the process of poisoning my body. By the way, do you know the difference between you and seaweed? What? Seaweed bears a lot of nutrition, but as for you, you'll bear our children in the future. Hi, Diah! Wake up! Gosh. What is it this time? Hey, Diah! Why is it so early, Nik? This morning, I've prepared roll dumplings, but I didn't dress them properly. Nik, I think it's still too early. Don't you want to dress them first? Do you want to? Don't worry, I had my eyes shut! It was my mouth that dropped open. I'm sorry about earlier. No worries, it was a vitamin. I've prepped the meal on the table. Thank you. It feels good to hear you say the words, "thank you." I am thanking the food yesterday because it turned out fine. -Sure. -Where are you sitting? Your voice sounds like it's coming from a distance. Are you sitting down there? Yes. Well, come over here and sit with me. No, It's all right. Are you sure you don't want to sit with me? Of course, I do! I am sitting down now. Do you know any nice places to visit? I want to go sightseeing. Such as the canal, you know? "Canal"? You mean Songdo beach? Well, it's a place where you can row boats. Have you been there? Is it far from here? It'll take an hour by bus, and only 30 minutes by taxi. But of course, it'll be more costly. But wait! You can also walk! You'll get there anyway. Wow, you could be a tourist guide. Well, I am a tour guide. What a coincidence! Do you want to go with me? All of the expenses are on me. But can you give me a discount for your tour guide fee? We're both Indonesian. Are you crazy? I can't see a thing! So what if you're blind? I can be your eyes. And you'll be my tour guide! It's a good idea, right? It's awesome! Diah! Diah. Why do you still use the cane? I can be your cane. Stop it! Hello, Busan! Don't yell like that, it's embarrassing! There's no one here, why would we be embarrassed? You sit way too close, there's no space for me! I don't mean to! It's the boat that made me! Come on, Nik! Not too close, we just knew each other. It's not polite! Move your ass! Thank you! You're most welcome. Nik! Here. Nik? Where's my straw? I took it. Where is yours? It's all used. What? Did you swallow them? No. I made this. I made a thousand stars! Did you really count them all? -You really want to know? -Not really! Instead of waiting for the stars to fall, I'd rather make them. I believe it will have the same effect! I wish the lake back home was as clean as this. I will definitely spend my time there. That's the moral message. I miss Indonesia. It's been so long since I went back. Is your family still there? Both of my parents passed away, but my sister is in Yogyakarta. Mind your steps. You could get pregnant. Up, there. Down. Turn to the left a bit. Goodness! Thank you for today, Nik. You're welcome. Thank you as well for accompanying me. After all the time we just spent together, I feel that we have... You keep laughing like this. I think I can keep you happy all the time. And you always laugh even when I repeat the same joke all over again. Don't you want to invite me in for a drink? Don't you want to chat more? Are you sure you don't want to talk more? We can fool around more. We can burn rubbish bags together. Maybe build a power plant for our future? Hello, Diah! I have something for you. Diah? All right then. I'm going to leave it on the table. Nik? Have you experienced winter before? I haven't. Wait, I have! Really? It was when you were cold to me. That time, I felt like you were like Elsa, and I was Olaf. Come on, melt your heart, Diah! Make it warm for Nik! Here, sweet-talk to my hand! Let go! What are you doing? This place is so romantic, don't you think? Especially if there's someone to embrace. That's a dating code. The locals say that seaweed can make you happy. I think you should have them more often. I used to make seaweed for someone before. I hope that he is happy. Nik? Nik? Hey, where are you going? I'm here. Are you afraid of heights? How do you know that? Of course! We must be on the glass floor area. I know this place so well. Come here! Don't be afraid! Come here! Nik, come here! But I'm not too sorry. All right, let me walk with you instead, so you won't have to be afraid. Nik, how come you've never asked me how I became blind? I don't think you want to talk about it. That's why I never asked. The doctor said it's temporary blindness caused by stress. But if I keep stressing myself, I could lose my sight permanently. Don't worry. It's just temporary blindness. You have me now. I will always make you laugh and keep you away from stress. Nick, it's really fun going out with you. As it turns out, we don't always have to see to feel it. But you still have to always pray so that you can see again and be able to feel more things. But unfulfilled wishes hurt even more so it's better not to hope anymore. Hey, Diah! Are you staring at me? What? You can see now? I can smell the fish you had earlier. I thought so. Hello? Yes, I'm still outside. No, not at my terrace. I went out with my Indonesian friend. Do you want to talk to him? Hold on. Here! No! It's all right! It's my sister. She wants to talk to you. -Talk about what? -Just talk to her! Hello? Okay. Here. What did she say to you? She said I have to marry you or she will throw me in jail. Are you serious? Of course not. I asked her to call again later because we're still enjoying the tour. Silly! Take a step down and then left. Down. Down again. And after these steps, we are going to turn left. You have to remember, okay? Down again and afterward, make a right. Turn right at the next corner. My place is far, yet close. I'm so tired. Are we still far? No, we're almost there. Let's go then! Okay, let's go. Watch out, we're approaching a step. Right, now up! Okay, turn left here. Remember! Diah! Let's go! Time to leave this place. Hey, Diah! Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. You... You look so pretty. Really? Let me take you! Don't throw your cane like that. They're not cheap. I bet you would've been able to feed the poor with thousands of this. Why did you stop? The food is really good, right? Yes. In moments like this, what do you often think of? I... I miss riding my bike. Then just ride it! But how am I supposed to do it? No need to ask how, just ride it! I'll help you. If you believe in me, you will be able to ride your bike. Do you know what I miss the most? I don't. What? I miss basking. What? "Basking"? I'll show you. Dance like a songstress, okay? What? I can't do that! Have you ever gone to a traditional Indonesian wedding? Let me teach you! I don't think I can! Come on. Your thumbs up! Ready? Dance and just follow the rhythm! That's it! Like that. That's right! -Like this? -Yes! Why is the voice so similar to yours? There are still many things you don't know about me. I haven't been circumcised. I have bottles of soju! Let's get drunk! What? No! They say people who like to get drunk always have an evil plan on their sleeves. All right then. And you dare speak of evil plans? Come on. Move your hips. How would you know when you are in love? It's when your world suddenly starts to be different. All the things you do and everything you think of, it has to have something to do with that person. And then you'll realize that your expression definitely changes too. That's why every time you see the person you like, they can see how much happier you look. But what if you're blind? Hey, Nik! I'm just kidding. Because I think love is blind. Now, look who's getting embarrassed? Do you think I'm that easy? When you are in love, you don't need to see the person. You just need to feel them. Just like when you are peeing. You just feel it, right until the last drop. But I hope I still get to see you eventually. It's not important. It won't benefit the world. Still, it would be different if you could see the face of the person you are talking to. Do you really want to see my face? Your eyelashes, they're long! You have very soft cheeks! You have a mustache! It's tickling! I think you're very handsome, Nick. You can be a Korean actor! Diah. You really are blind. But your face is so round. Your nose isn't sharp-pointed. I don't think you have a western bloodline. I thought you did because the name Nik sounded western. I'm originally from Java. My name is just shortened to Nik. What's your full name? Nikmatullah. "Nikmatullah"? Go on, and make a turn here. We're here! This is where the love locks are. Move a bit more. There's more space over there. Let's do it here. Take this. Let me help. All right, we're all set. Where's the key? Hold on. Why is the shape a bit weird? It's kind of different. That's just your imagination. It is the key! -All right, I'm going to keep it. -Okay. Here, this is where our love is. Don't forget okay? What are you doing? I'll get dizzy like this. -Are you dizzy? -Yes. There. This is for you. Your wedding gift. What, a wedding gift? This is just a fake wedding. Why do you have to give me a present? I want to marry you for real! Let me open it for you. What is it, Nik? That's a darumadal. What? You mean a Daruma doll? Is that what you are supposed to call it? Let me guide you to do the eyes. After you make one of its eyes, you can make a wish. Don't cry, Diah. Don't cry. You never know, your wish might be granted tomorrow. Then we can complete its other eye. Why do I feel like we've known each other for quite some time? Indeed, it's been weeks already. What if my sight never comes back? We'll still go out together! We'll revisit the places we went to together. We going to have meals together. We will dance and burn the rubbish together. It just started. The fireworks spark with yellow, orange and gold. It gets bigger as it spreads into the sky. Nik. Did you know that last year, even though I could see, I think this year's fireworks are way more beautiful! I may not be able to see, but I can feel them. It's all because of you. -You wait here. -Where are you going? I have a surprise for you. Don't be gone for too long. I won't! Nik! Nik! Nik! Diah? Nik! Nik! Diah, where have you been? You've started to make me worried again. Why do you always disappear like this? God knows how many messages I've left for you. I've tried to reach Nik, but there is no response as well. Otherwise, I'll really come over. Let me know, okay? Take a step down and then left. Down. One more down. And after these steps, we are going to turn left. You have to remember, okay? Down again and afterward, make a right. Turn right at the next corner. You will find another road that descends, but it's also kind of a hike. Diah, I finally managed to make a thousand straw-stars, and all I wish is just for you to regain your sight. Once it comes true, I'm not sure what's going to happen when you find out who I really am. Good morning! One. You're the one who was there for me when I have completely given up. I thought I was still drunk, and you were just my imagination. Two. The number of times I pretended to be asleep when you came to see me. And yet, you still took care of me while flashing your warm smile. Three. The third day I started to realize that perhaps you cannot cook anything else. Hey! Why, Jun-ho? Why do we have to postpone our wedding? I'm sorry, Diah. But I'm not ready yet. Jun-ho, please be honest with me. Do you really want to marry me? I just need more time. We have come to the right place indeed! Can you please try to understand? I just need some popcorn now. Hey, soju. Did you just see that? Look at me, you piece of shit! I love soju. Four. You tried to wake me up four times, and I just realized that after the fourth call. I really stink. Where is the Heart off to? Five. I tried to approach you five times. Forget it, Nik. You don't know her. Why follow her? She will never fall for a mere loser like me. But... The heart wants what it wants. Hey! Banana! That's what men say to get a girl. Six. I peed six times while wearing my banana costume. I just couldn't hold it any longer. I don't know why, but at the moment I chose not to pee. I just know that I didn't want to lose sight of you even for just a second. Keep going straight. Seven. You cried for seven minutes after sounding the bell. You might not know it, but the banana was the witness to all of that. BOX OF LUCK You're so beautiful. Is there anything I can do for you? Got it, let's not fight anymore. Thanks for the surprise. Good morning! Are you Indonesian? Me too! Let's go have lunch together! But now, I have to go... Jun-ho, did you wait too long? -You waited long, right? I am sorry. -It's okay, I understand. -What do I do? -It's fine. Tonight at 8 p.m., let's meet at Gisan Kkomjanguh. Don't forget, okay? Okay. Eight. Eight reasons came across my mind to not get involved. But there's only one reason that made me do it. That is the knowledge that you deserve better. What are you looking at? What a strange man. Excuse me. Hello! Hello! Here's a letter for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Nine. Nine times, I almost convinced myself to drag you out of there. I don't want you to feel the same pain I had. But you must know how awful the person you loved the most. Don't worry, everything is going to be okay. Wait for me. Ten. I counted from one to ten so that I won't act recklessly. But well, life is too short. So I'll better act than regret. You piece of shit! Diah, I wrote to you just in case you are able to see again. I still don't have the balls to say these things... Hello, good morning! I was that beggar you fed seaweed soup. I was the Banana you were with, and I was the one who led you to uncover your fiancé and your best friend's affair. I hope you understand, Diah. I had lost my love and my will to live before, just like you. I lost my trust and my "sight" too. But you helped me regain them back. It's weird. When you are able to see, you didn't see me. But when you turned blind, you saw me. Thank you, Diah. Thank you, my Heart. Still in love with you, Banana.
