February 1945. The evacuation. Down! Up! WEREWOLF Hey there Lonka, here's another one for you. He keeps running away. Throw him in the back. Take care, durak! They're your people. They'll take care of you. Hi there! Done. Beware of the Wehrwolf. Take care. What's your name? 2-0-5-0-1-4 Mine is earlier. Tag, you're it! It’s scary here in the wilderness all by myself. At night, I lock myself in completely. It’s Poland now, but it's just drunken Russians and starving Germans all around. They'll turn palaces into orphanages, schools and hospitals. Just lke in Russia. If there's anything left of those, that is. Why were you taken to the camp, Miss? Two kilos of headcheese. And the children? When they took us away from Auschwitz, we ended up in the nearby camps. Gross Rosen. The Germans killed off their families. After the liberation, they had nobody to go back to. End of story. But now you will take care of them. I’m heading back to Warsaw. I thought Miss would help me out. Miss can't take it any more. I’m leaving them with you. A spoiled brat, are we? We have some potatoes, some old underwear. And a bar of soap. It will only last us two days. The kids can't go hungry, or they'll kill each other. Then Jet them kill each other. They have liice. They need a bath. Did you cut your veins? I bit into them. We'll rub oil on their heads and boil the rags. That'll kill the lice. Food is a bigger problem. Perhaps the Russians will bring some tomorrow. Take off the masks. We will eat with cutlery, like people do. There is no water. We have to fetch it from the well. No electricity, either. You tried to scratch off your number? You can't get rid of a tattoo. Where are you from, prince charming? Silesia. Krauthead. Try this. Is it meat? Lonka's heart. BERLIN! MARCH! Splashing around, Kraut? Stop splashing, Kraut! There he is. Marching on Berlin, are you...? I can tell you've stitched headcheese before. We could use thicker thread. If you eat with your hands or fight again, you go back behind barbed wire. Use the cutlery! You could do haberdashery for a Jiving. We're out of potatoes. We need to go to the forest and pick some berries. Maybe something grew in the fields already. Go on, pig out! You thief, you shouldn’t be getting any! What's your name? She doesn't speak. Time to get back. The more air they get, the calmer they'll be in the evening. I'll go back now, in case the Russians bring any food. Don't go too far. I heard the Germans built bunkers all over these mountains. Killing thousands of people. Coming along...? The jacket. Wladek! I can't stay with you. Jump! Go on, jump! You still here? I’m not going anywhere with no food. Doll! Dolly! What happened? Come. Come run. Hello. Bottoms up. It will do you good. Did Germans kill Jadwiga? What does the little girl say? She doesn't speak. Go look for that werewolf. Sweet girl. Shut the door, kid. Don't. Don't shut the door! Get lost! Zhenia, where are you?! I'll kill you, motherfucker! Dolly! Dolly? Doll? Are you there? It’s here. Hold the door. Lonka and the other Russki just fled. They left the truck behind? It got surrounded by the dogs. Had they failed to escape, Lonka's body would lie at the door. Maybe we can go out to the garden? Down! Is it true that SS officers turned into wolves? What's your name, then? Kraut is fine with me. There's water. Pass me the jug. Not enough. We'll look for more later. We have nothing to eat. Not the peelings! They will make you sick. Who? Me. Who? Me. Who? In the camp, if you start throwing up of shitting water, you're done. You Jose all your water until you're dead. One Gypsy got so thirsty... ...he went crazy. He bit his veins and drank his own blood. Good dog! C'mon! Come! Come! Stay! Stay...! Lay down! Come here! Come here! Down! Stay! I'll go first and distract them. Then you can get to the truck. You drive up to the window and then we're off. You can't run from there. Where will you hide? You saw it yourself. They're completely wild! I'll jump down the coal chute... ...and then you'll drive up to the window. What if the car keys aren't inside? They're there. I saw them. They hang a string with a bolt attached. Where did you get it? I found it in the cellar. Move back. Is it meat? It’s engine grease. We can grease ourselves. It’s going to rain today. We'll collect some water and wait until someone comes. End of discussion. Lie down and don't move. We can't stay here! We'll die of thirst! There's no water! Somebody will come. Where do you want to go? Home! There is no home. This is all there is. You stay here! Understood?! You've got to listen to me! They would’ve fucked you if it weren't for me! Look. Son of a bitch. Is it true what you said about that Gypsy? The one who went crazy and drank his own blood? Yes, him. I’m not the one who told the story. Hanka... Are you asleep? I’m sorry. Are you asleep? I know how to get out of here... Are you asleep? Come here! Lay down! Lay down! Obey, down! Guard! Guard! Come here! Lay down! Guard! Down! Guard! Down! Stay! Down! Fuck off! Try in German... Lift your arm... Water. Water, for fuck's sake. Come on. Where's the dog? Upstairs. Did you kill it? Maybe you ran from the Hitlerjugend, Kraut? Do you even have a number under those scabs? Show me your hand. Who? Me. Who? Me. Guard the door. Lonka's hidden in the closet. He didn't make it. No one will save us. We'll do as you've planned. Fuck! There are no keys! And the gun? It fell out. Jump out quickly, then! Jump out yourself! Great plan! What are you staring at? What are you doing here?! I’m hungry! Get inside! Hasn't your mother teach you not to steal? Sit! Did you steal my grease? Was it tasty? Did you grease yourself? Are you from around here? Don't know how to say 'thank you'? Don't you go running around the mountains alone. The Russkis are everywhere. They kill us like lice. Don't tell anyone you've seen me. They can't find me here. Are you from around here? Kraut! Meat. It’s not moving. Leave it! Water not there. CONCENTRATION CAMP GROSS ROSEN Open the door. Wladek! Wladek!
