- [Voiceover] It's a thin line that exists between enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with a woman you love and getting your head smashed in with a broken whiskey bottle by her husband. I've lived my life on this line for 15 years now. It wasn't always that way though. Sure I was a National Merit Scholar, lauded member of the Honor Society, and somewhat of a ladies' man. I was born with the right stuff, hardy Irish stock on my father's side and the passionate Italian blood of a trained killer on my mother's. I'm the last of a dying breed of men though, men who had it and let it go back into the ocean just to see if they could catch it again. That's why I decided to slow things down a bit, pursue better health and nutrition. I've been eating better, sleeping better, and I've never felt better. So pay no attention to those insidious rumors started by Marcus Drummond about some mental meltdown I suffered. They're simply not true. (acoustic guitar plays) (soft rumba music) - Scouring the want ads, eh, Gordo? Not satisfied with your bartending position here? - No, it's just that I'm trying to, um, broaden my horizons. New experiences. - Well, good luck, my friend. - Thanks Ruben, you know, I haven't seen you so merry in some time. - Big date tonight. Stephanie. - Stefania? But she doesn't even know you exist. - Ning. - At your service, Captain. - To the contrary, Ning, she very well knows I exist. - That's right, Ning, although you'd be a lot better off if she didn't. - I can't imagine why that would be the case. I mean look at this chiseled physique. - Impressive. So how did you get her to agree on a date? - It's not so much of a date as it is my knowing where she's going to be tonight. - Here's one to fuel your fire. I call this one Jean Bonet. - Thanks for the concern ol' friend, but I'm going for a 20-mile run. Come party time my body will be toned, my mind'll be sharp, and I'm gonna be so primed for love, I'm gonna strum fuckin' Arpeggios on this girl's heart strings. - Good plan. - Ruben, that's extremely dangerous. I feel I should chaperone you. - Not today, Ning. My methods are time-tested and this tiger roams solo. ♫ Gimme love like ya really, really mean it ♫ Let's do away with the ol' touch-and-go ♫ I wasn't lookin' for this dream to believe in ♫ But now it's here, so where do we go ♫ And you should know that your heart is deservin' ♫ I brought my guts to this party we can share ♫ A lot of times that were pretty unnervin' ♫ Were those times where you don't seem to care ♫ So if you stop ♫ Will I be standing there ♫ Whoa oh oh oh ♫ But don't stop, don't stop for me ♫ I said don't stop ♫ (giggling) - Marcus Drummond. Any time, villian. - Looking rather moist tonight. It's a good look. - Out of my way. I've an appointment with destiny and shall not tarry. Where is my beloved? - (snickers) You mean Stefania? She's right yonder, my good squire. I shall not be the one to keep you from your destiny. - Fuck head, I thought we told you never to come back here again. - Oh my god. It's that weird guy Weird fixings bar. Do not leave me here alone. - You, sir, are an imbecile, and I shall not have words with you. - Poor wayward soul, hmph. - Good evening to you ladies. Destiny has arrived in the form of a man. - Ruben, I have a very jealous boyfriend. - Jealous of your beauty I imagine. - And he's a mixed martial artist. - Stephanie. - It's Stefania. - Stefanunia, I implore you look into these eyes, these eyes that adore you. And take what I offer you which is everything and as we share from the same cup. - Okay. - Hey baby. Want me to cut this douche loose? - No Howie, everything's fine here. - What the fuck were you thinking man? - You, sir, made your last gesture and I demand satisfaction. You and me, right now, let's go. - Oh my God! Ruben, are you okay? - Come on baby. - You're a retard Howie and quit all your dumbass (mumbling) class. (llaughing) - Ning! Excellent job, Ning. Think I can feel the vertebrae fusing together again. - Ruben, I think you made a great impression. - Well, a small price to pay for success. Anyway, I'm glad you had this neck corset handy. - Actually, that was my grandmother's cervical collar. She wore it during her neck reduction. - Goiter? - Her neck was too spacious, Ning! - I can only imagine. - Listen to me. - [Ruben] Gentlemen! While I was victorious in the fickle ways of love, I've concluded that Marcus Drummond must be dealt with forthwith to determine which of us is the better man. - A gentlemen off. - Precisely. - Ruben, I feel this will be very dangerous. - Oh it will be Ning. I'll make sure of that.
