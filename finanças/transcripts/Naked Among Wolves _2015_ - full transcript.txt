I'm tired. Lean on me, but don't fall asleep. Don't fall asleep. Which white wine did Mum like? I can't go any further. What did it taste of? Keep your eyes open. Don't fall asleep. It's all my fault. No. You were right. So have you agreed on a name? Yes. Emil. Anton. What if it's a girl? It isn't, judging by his kicks. Miss! Emil. Anton. -Emil. -Anton. -Emil. -Anton. -Emil. -Anton. Stop! Out! Get out! -Now! -Faster. -Get out! -March! March! -Come on! -Quick! -Come on! Out! -March! March! Move it! Out! Everybody out! Move it! Get a move on! Stay in the middle. On the double! March! Move it! Get going! Buchenwald concentration camp April 1943. All right you rabble, fall in, two rows. March! -Get down! Do it! -Fall in! Eyes front! Hands behind your heads! Crouch down! Do you feel the pain? Get used to it. This is a labour camp. Here we will make proper Germans of you. Crouch! You will work as hard as possible. You are dishonourable, defenceless, with no rights. Do you need your pills? -No. It's okay. -Your lot is to slave. We'll make useful people of you, or you'll die here. Dying here is not as easy as some may hope. Crouch! You will soon understand that. We will now take down all your personal details. You should be loud, clear and truthful. This way. You that way. Go in there. Stop! -Pippig, Gottfried? -Yes. Move along! -Faster! -Right! Move! Up you go! Freimann? Yes, Rottenfuhrer. Know why you've been imprisoned? No, Rottenfuhrer. What whore shat you into the world? Pippig, Hans? Here, Unterscharfuhrer! Know why you've been imprisoned? Bolshevik propaganda, Unterscharfuhrer. A red! So? Learn anything? Other than Bolshevism? -Carpenter, Unterscharfuhrer. -Carpenter! Didn't one get nailed to a cross once before? Did everything go well? Did you distribute it all? Yes. We switched sites. The Gestapo is probably there. I have more new ones. You really think you can prevent the war with leaflets? If we don't, who will? Get up! See the gate down there, you freaks. Get yourselves through it on the double. Two steps forward. Right turn! Without step, march! Halt! TO EACH WHAT HE DESERVES Keep moving! NAKED AMONG WOLVES. Keep going. Undress. Take it all off! You piece of shit, how dare you look at me? Take him away. -Get up. -Leave him. Stand up! Don't look them in the eye. Ever. Hey! Sick bay! Get down! Go on, down! I don't want to see any heads here. Prisoner Clothing Room 'Effects Room'. -Sign here. -Next. Attention! Don't you dare smuggle anything in. Carry on! Passed the entrance exam? Name? Why are you here? My sense of humour. Comedian. The Fuhrer didn't laugh. Name? Sign. Pippig, Hans. Sign. Wrong size. Next. Name? Thanks for the bread. You're Gottfried's son, aren't you? Why? I'm sorry. It's okay. He's in sick bay. He was a good comrade. They killed him. You work with them! No. Keep quiet. Want to know how I've survived this long? Luck. And the right friends. Sew this on. I'm your Kapo now. I'll make sure you get enough food. Yes. Two years later. Spring 1945. To the west allied troops have reached Germany. The US 3rd Army has crossed the Rhine near Koblenz and captured Darmstadt. WORK MAKES YOU FREE In January 1945 Auschwitz in Poland is liberated by the Red Army. By then the SS had sent 60,000 prisoners on death marches to camps like Buchenwald. 29th March, 1945 14 days until liberation. Another shipment from the east. Jews. It'll be the last one. We have no space left in the Little Camp as it is. The Americans have reached the Rhine near Aschaffenburg. That's still over 300 km. It'll take them two weeks to get here. Then they have 14 days to evacuate us all. Or kill us. Camp Commandant's Office. So? Any news? Can we get started at last? Himmler hasn't yet decided when the camp is to be cleared. We're trapped. Bolsheviks to the east and the Americans have crossed the Rhine. How long till they're here? Five weeks? Three weeks? Two? Yes and every day we get new shipments from the east. When will they give us the order? Heavy artillery, bazookas, flame throwers and the camp will be dust in half an hour. You still haven't grasped what it will mean for us if a single corpse is found. You just want to be pals with the Americans. I'll leave no one alive here. I am still your commandant and you will obey orders. If you gave any. You were told to find the leaders of the resistance and eliminate them. How long do you need to chop off the last few heads? We must ensure the evacuation is not jeopardised by an uprising. So for the last time, eliminate the leaders. Come! You too. No talking! Strip off. Now. Faster. Here. Shirt as well. Take it all off. Why are you standing around? Get up there. Shower. Quiet, everyone! Quiet everyone! Only water. No gas. Come on. Strip. Go. Don't sit around. Strip! Yes. My suitcase. I don't understand. Is that your case? Yes! Jankowski Zacharias. From Warsaw. Leonid! Important things are in it. Don't open it. I promised to take care of it. Tell him he'll get his case back and to get undressed. Don't worry, you'll get it back. We'll keep it for you. You must go to disinfection. Come on! Why are you hanging about? Strip off! Quarantine 'Little Camp'. In you go. In you go. From one of the Polish Jews. Who's this little man? Are you insane? What are you doing? What are we meant to do? Register him, what else? Then he's dead. There are kids in the camp. But older. If he goes to Little Camp, he's too small to survive, they'll beat him to death. What will you do? Hide him? What if he screams? Does he understand us? Hello, little man. Little man, where are you from? Can you understand me? You must keep really quiet now, you hear? The SS must not find you. At least he knows what the SS is. Poor worm. The things he's had to see. If Zweiling sees him, we'll land in Mandrill's bunker. No way, not so close to the end! Breathe a word to Zweiling, and it will be your last. A word to me? What's in there? Bloody Jew things, Hauptscharfuhrer. Would you like to see? No. Burn the stuff, before we all get infected. Of course, Hauptscharfuhrer. Why don't we have a look inside after all? Open it. You failed to mention the Jew things also contain a small hidden Jew. You will all go to the bunker for this, to Mandrill. I can explain, Hauptscharfuhrer. Aircraft sirens. American B17s. They bombed Erfurt yesterday. I've treated you well. I've always been good to you. -Always! -Yes. I can vouch for that, Hauptscharfuhrer. If this gets out, then it's your heads, not mine. Got it? You want to get out of here alive. We all do, don't we? Will he report it? I'm not going up the chimney for the brat. What about his father? Well, what about his father? He's in the Little Camp. Andre.? Someone must look after the kid. You brought him here and you've no idea of the situation you've put me in. Who do you belong to? Huh? You know, there are two sorts of prisoner. One eats everything at once. What's yours is yours. No one can take it away. If you're dead in an hour, at least you won't stand hungry before Jehovah and have to beg. And the other sort, they ration things. Save the best bits. Something to look forward to all day. Victory of the mind over the body, so to speak. Understand? What do you want? Cigarettes? Vodka? Cute boy? What's so important, then? In the last shipment, a Pole brought in a young boy in a suitcase. So what? The boy wasn't registered. He's hidden in the Effects Room. Pippig is with him. Are you insane? Herbert, we've never had such a young kid. He's three at most. He'll die without us. If the SS find that kid, they'll take your comrade and you as Kapo. They've been after us for months. The kid has to go, with the next shipment. In the suitcase again. You're our military trainer. You know everything about us. We've spent months preparing for the day when the SS eradicates the camp. This isn't about a single boy. It's about 50,000 people. We can't jeopardise the uprising because of a three year old. Hofel, the kid must go. Here, eat! Go on. Listen, we can't sit around all day. If the SS come... No, no. It's okay. Careful. Hot. Yes? When does the next shipment leave? Tomorrow morning. We must send 200 to Bergen-Belsen. Proll is completing the list. I have a request. Again. Take Marcel Dupres off the list. Why? I'd like to add a Pole instead. Here. From the Little Camp. Who is this man? He came with the last intake from Auschwitz, with a kid in his suitcase. And? He's hidden in the Effects Room. Not registered? Came in a case, so he goes out in a case. With Hofel? Is Hofel part of the uprising too? The kid's only three. Hofel got soft. To the Effects Room. Just because you don't have your people... You don't have them under control, so I'm to send a child to his death? We've spent months preparing for the last day. The kid jeopardises everything. He must go. We'll face the consequences some day. Perhaps the Americans will intercept the shipment. Who are we if we can't even protect a child? The boy's name is Stephan Cyliak. He told me he's not father. The father was his friend. Lawyer from Warsaw. Him, wife and two daughters murdered in Auschwitz. Only the boy survived, by a miracle. He swore to friend, the small boy will not die. He's all he has. Tell him he must go now. I told him he will see him every day. -If he comes every day... -He won't. He gets transported tomorrow. And he needs his suitcase. Full. Where to? Bergen-Belsen. Bergen-Belsen. If the boy survives transportation, he'll be killed there. Hans, that's an order! Mind it doesn't get too high. There he is again. -Up! -Move it! Here. The corrected list from LA1. Jankowski instead of Dupres. -Keep moving! -There. Keep moving! That's him. Get out of here. You are good people. Is he okay? Did he sleep well? Has he eaten? Every thing's fine. He'll be fine, brother. -Where are we going? -You'll see in a minute. Jankowski. 140501. Come. Come on. Here. Run, run! Where's my suitcase? Why's the boy still here? They're leaving. -I can't do it. -That was an order. -We can't sacrifice it all for the kid. -No, just ourselves. What's left of us! You don't feel it any longer. If we sacrifice the boy, we lose everything. Take that boy down at once. Got it? Quiet, brother! Everything will be fine. Attention! In three files! March! We'll be free again soon. It won't be long now. Then we'll go to the zoo. We'll see monkeys. Giraffes. Elephants. # Sleep, my son, sleep, my doll. # # Mama's going to bring you milk # feed you and hug you while you sleep. # By the will of God in Heaven # I will bring you up. # And by the will of God in Heaven # I will bring you up. # Has the kid gone? Couldn't do it. 'Who are we if we can't even protect a child?' Now we can't get the boy out of the camp. What now? Anyone caught with the boy will die. He's hungry. If he's to live he needs milk and sugar. The US 3rd Army advances towards Fulda. 200 kilometres from Buchenwald. German forces defend with a 2,000-troop tank and anti-aircraft brigade. Two days later they surrender to the American forces. 31st March, 1945 Twelve days until liberation. Did you hear about Lublin? The Russians left the camp guards to the prisoners. They're all dead. Block 38, attention! Block 38 present at roll call with 802 prisoners. Original number 821. Current number 802. Ten in sick bay. Five on assignment. Four dead. There's 50,000 of us, and 1,000 of them. Why don't we just charge and kill them? However many they shoot, enough will make it through. It's too soon. We must wait till the Americans come. Untersturmfuhrer, camp with 47,571 prisoners complete. On assignment, 342. Sick, 3,297. Deaths, 109. Caps off! Caps on! Correct! Clothing room prisoners to the clothing room. All outdoor squads step forward. Road building squad and quarrying squad depart! Just a little more. It's the SS lunch break soon, Dad. Dad! What's this? Are you sleeping here? Carry that rock over there. I'll do that. Get moving! Dad! So top command was able to rely completely on the infantry, as with unprecedented courage they fought the attacking tanks of the Bolshevik... On the eastern bank of the Rhine, north of the Ruhr, the 21st Army Group has linked all its bridgeheads. The British and the American ground and airborne troops now hold one solid bridgehead some 30 miles long and about seven miles deep. So far 8,000 German prisoners have been taken by the 21st Army Group. German resistance, which has been heaviest on the northern end where the British are... Back from the tailor's, Hauptscharfuhrer. Yes, yes. Are pouring men and material across the river in preparation for the decisive battle. Look, this is for you. Slowly, slowly. Not so fast. You must swallow a little at a time. Where did you get the milk? There's a cow in the field and it goes moo. Kapos from Blocks 21 and 27 report to the gate. He's not safe here. Block 61 'Epidemic Barrack'. Do something. Please. Gangrene. Too late. He's delirious. Not too late with medicine. A Scharfuhrer brought this. It was outside the gate. A three-year-old Jewish boy is being hidden in the Effects Room. By the Kapo. Now they're snitching on each other. Hofel? Sure. A red, like I said. Why's he being so stupid as to risk his head for a Jewish kid now? The Kapo... He hasn't come to our attention before. Attention! Fall in! Effects Room Command fall in! 12 prisoners at work, one on assignment. Where is Hauptscharfuhrer Zweiling? Having breakfast, Untersturmfuhrer. Looks like one of you wants to leave through the chimney. Where is the boy? Which boy, Untersturmfuhrer? The Jew brat. Where is he? There's no Jew brat here, Untersturmfuhrer. Your last chance. Or you're all going to the bunker and Mandrill. So? Where is he? No child. Excuse me? Prisoner number 8340. No child, Untersturmfuhrer. All right. As you wish. You... and you, let's go for a walk. If anyone would like to spare them lots of suffering, or remembers where the child is... Otherwise we'll be back. They know what they're doing. They won't just leave us to the Americans. Don't be scared. You're safe here. They won't dare come in here. He can only eat small portions. The crust is too much. I fed him crumbs. Okay, we'll take care of him. Tell him I'll visit him. You're staying with me for now, yes? We can take better care of you here and give you food. Don't worry, I'll look after him. May God bless and protect you. May God watch over you and give you peace. Yes. Of course, Reichsfuhrer. Heil Hitler. So? Regarding the evacuation, we're to wait a little. Wait. For what? He's negotiating with the Swedes and using the Jews as bargaining chips. He's hoping for a unilateral ceasefire with the Americans and then to attack the Russians with them. -And if that fails? In case you still haven't got it, we're following Himmler's personal orders and without compromise! If a single Jew is left alive, he will become the nemesis of our children and grandchildren and all because we were too weak and too cowardly. Two prisoners are being interrogated in Mandrill's bunker? Reds. They're trying to hide a Jewish child. They'll give us the names in the secret organisation. Confinement cells building 'Bunker' Marian? Marian? You can do it. Be brave. Try and stay awake till I'm back, okay? The SS have Hofel. He's in the bunker. What? Yes. Some swine lost his nerve and snitched about the kid. No. The Pole took him. Hofel was ordered to do that. They're hot on your heels. If Hofel breaks, the whole thing's over. He knows the gun stashes, the resistance groups links and leaders. One single name and the chain will unravel. And we all go up the chimney. Don't you trust each other? What kind of organisation is that, with no trust. Trust? Mandrill's a sadist. How long can Hofel hold out in the bunker? No idea. I have to inform the leaders of the committee. I presume you know why you're here. I want the names. What... what names? The leaders of your secret organisation and all the plans for your uprising. He's all yours. Don't play with him for too long. The Americans have reached Bad Hersfeld. That's still 130 kilometres. And Mandrill? Don't kill him. I'm ready. You too? Attention. Testing, testing. Counting three, three, four, four, five, five and eight. Test completed. An armed uprising and Hofel, who knows where the arms are stashed, is in the bunker? He won't survive. No one withstands Mandrill. And he will talk. If the SS don't have the boy, Hofel and Kropinski will hold out. No! I'm no thief! Let go of me! No! If the SS find the boy, they use him as leverage. I'll contact the bunker guard. Peep, peep, peep. Hello, Stephan. Peep, peep. He doesn't need this now. You do. You must eat, Dad. Stephan. Stephan, come here. Have you had some time to think? -Hang him. -No. No. No. No. No! Wait. Where are your weapons hidden? How many are you? Is Kramer part of it? You only have to nod. Who else? 50 km from Buchenwald, the sub-camp at Ohrdruf is liberated by the US 3rd Army. Shortly before fleeing, the SS shoot scores of prisoners who are too weak for transportation. Kromsdorf 10 km east of Buchenwald. See how glad they are? Have you heard anything? 90 km to go. Just one more week. Then it's all over. The last thing I see will not be the crematorium. Then I will kill every one of them, very slowly. Eighteen. Hey! Lecherous filthy swine! Staring at the squire's daughter? Cool down! Come, come. Need something to stare at? I'll give you something to stare at. You think it's over? That they'll come and save you? Come on, then. On the West Prussian front, the Bolsheviks inside Greater Bollental... I'll start with you. Come on then! Stare! To extend the tactical successes from the previous day. But they faltered in the face of our determined infantry. To the south in Butow sustained enemy attacks were also repelled. The enemy's successful breakthrough near Rummelsburg was also contained almost everywhere and repelled in a fierce battle with heavy enemy losses. 68 tanks were destroyed and 32 guns were taken out. Stephan? Stephan? Stephan? Come here. Please. My father needs medicine. Medicine for information. Good information. When did you say? At three. You think you can trust Forster? No one knows him. They say dogs become like their owners. Camp electrician to cell block. There are exceptions. Camp electrician reporting, Hauptscharfuhrer. The main fuse has blown. Probably a short... Shut up and fix it if you want to leave here. -I need light to work. -Of course, Hauptscharfuhrer. Is the Kapo Hofel holding out? What are you whispering there? I said a short isn't too bad if the mains wiring isn't burnt out. The Hauptscharfuhrer checked the wiring himself... and found nothing. Here it is. Short circuit. Like I said, as long as all the mains wiring isn't blown. Doesn't look like it. There we are, Hauptscharfuhrer. Out! Before I get bored. Where were you? With my wife... Dora. My children. Oh, God! Marian, this torture... I'm not strong enough. Hitler is an arsehole. He screwed up the war for us. In a few days the Americans will be here. But you needn't have any hope. I'll kill everything in the bunker and you two, I'll leave till last. Keep these on. Five minutes before I leave, I'll come and... They want to make animals of us. But we refuse. Fascinating how many kinds of pain there are. So why is this Hofel still holding out? Because these damned communists are even tougher than the SS. An important message for the commandant. A child is being hidden in Block 61. Aha! That will soften up Hofel. Move it! Get back! In the corner! Where is he? Open up! Don't! SS. Be quiet! Wait! It's time to set an example. What is this? Where is he? Where is the boy? He's no longer safe here. We need a new hiding place for him, but first we must wait until it's dark. Be careful! Don't slip or you'll drown in sewage. The Americans are near Erfurt. That's only 40 km away. Maybe it won't be long now. -Okay? -Yes. 3,000 years ago the Angel of Death saved the Jewish boys. Maybe he'll do it again today. Good luck, Comrade. I'll be back tomorrow with food. This is a game, you know? We'll stay down here, but only a little bit. The others will look for us... but if they don't find us, we've won the game. Brother, stay here. Please! Stay beside me. Marian... we're free. You heard what he said. We'll be last. We have a noose around our necks. They can't do anything to us. Kropinski. Come. The Pole won't tell us. Do you know where the boy is? I don't know. Where is the child? I don't know. If I knew, I'd tell you. I don't... know. It was you who tipped us off. That wasn't me. That's Hauptscharfuhrer Zweiling's writing. Please. Please. I've been here since '38. I helped build the camp. Please! I'll do anything. Please. Please. -Where is the child? -I don't know. Fine. Then prove it. No. Please don't. Please. Please don't. He's next. No! No. Please! Please! No! Forgive me, comrade! I can't die! Forgive me! Comrade! Forgive me! Comrade! We never argued. Just once, when our son was born. I wanted to call him Anton. You insisted on Emil, because you liked Emil and the Detectives so much. I'm sure he'll be back soon with food. Just pestilence and filth. Look at that one. You there! Aren't you greeting us any more? What's that? You're smuggling food while the German nation fights for survival? Pick up the cap. Do it. NEUTRAL ZONE YOU WILL BE SHOT IMMEDIATELY. No cap? Won't you go and get it? Sorry, my boy. God will protect you. SS high command gives the order to clear all concentration camps near the front. Buchenwald concentration camp receives the order on 6th April, 1945. Untersturmfuhrer? You're following events on the front? I must take care of the camp. The camp will be cleared. I know you'll try everything to prevent that, but no one will be left here. So, what news is there? It's starting! They're getting serious. Himmler has wired new orders. The Jews are first in line. They're particularly important to them. 9,000. In Weimar there are 40 goods wagons for transport to Flossenburg. Tomorrow it's the Czechs, Poles and Russians. Whole blocks. Day after tomorrow, another 10,000. The Americans have taken Gotha and are advancing to Erfurt. We must wait until they're here. Only then do we have a chance. We'll not die without a fight. A few hundred of us against 1,500 heavily-armed SS troops. 91 rifles, 20 pistols and... Hand grenades and a machine gun. Our ammunition will last an hour at most. The only thing we can do is delay the shipments. Years of longing to get out of here and now hoping to stay inside. How long can you manage? Hours perhaps. Every hour counts. The Allies have come over 1,000 km since landing in Normandy. It's less than 100 now. The end is near. If we're to survive the end, we must stand together. Walter. You're first in line. The SS see you as the head. One of us must survive, so he can tell... Attention! On the orders of Reichsfuhrer SS, we are commencing the evacuation of the camp. Jews from Block 22, Block 32, Block 34, Block 35 and from Block 61 muster at once on the assembly square. Go! Go! I repeat, by command, on the orders of Reichsfuhrer SS, we are commencing the evacuation of the camp. Jews from Block 22... 7th April, 1945. Start of evacuation. To the Allies. To the army of General Patton. SOS! We request help. They want to evacuate us. 10,000 prisoners are moved south daily. The SS wants to destroy us. Move! Hurry! Hurry! Move it! Move it! Come on! Get going! We must get out. You stay here. I'll get food. Stephan... Stephan... Stephan? Here! I'm here. You've taken everything from us, but not what we are! We still exist! One day grass will grow here and overgrow the ruins. One day this will be forgotten. But you... No one will ever forget you! The shame of humanity. And when we all die, that boy will... 11th April, 1945. Day of liberation. 09:30 hours. Less than 20 km from Buchenwald the US 6th Armoured Division forces the German army into retreat. At Buchenwald concentration camp, the clearance of the camp is stopped. The SS considers murdering the remaining prisoners. Move it! Hurry up! Even more machine guns. -Keep going! -Take position! That should be enough. If we machine-gun them all now, we'll be next. Who gave the order? I did. It's our last chance to clear the camp. Tanks have been sighted on the plains. And now? Nothing will be left here when the Americans arrive. Aha. And what about the 20,000 corpses that will lie there and get us hanged? They can see 12 tanks from the camp. German or Patton's? Couldn't tell. Patton's stuck in Weimar. The SS put bazookas in the watch towers. Air cover has been requested. Then we'll all be machine-gunned. At least we'll die standing. Comrades! Alarm level three. Issue the weapons. Battle units to start positions. Go! Move in! -Keep going! -Take position. Go! Go! Go! You secure the generator room. Here. Catch. Thanks for looking after it. I didn't know! What? What? None of them still believes the Fuhrer will win. But if the order comes, they'll still fire, as good Germans. Americans. They'll give the order to open fire any minute. Give the order! Go ahead! Or else I will. Give the order now! Every second counts. You must switch off the generator for the fence. To all SS members. Leave the camp immediately! All SS members, leave the camp immediately. The camp will be surrendered. We will retreat. Out. Get out. Move it! Stop. You now have two options. Either you shoot me in the back, as you so enjoyed doing to us in the quarry... and I'll be your last dead prisoner. Or you may yet have a future after all. Where are you going, Schwahl? Are you clearing off? You will stay here. I have direct orders from Reichsfuhrer SS to take over the camp at Dachau. And what are we to do? Get hanged like in Lublin, yes? Get to safety, Kluttig. It's over. We should have killed them all. Please. Please don't. I saved a young boy, a Jew. What's he saying? Something about Jews. Please. Please don't. No! Please don't! Get up! I can't stand the sound of him any more. Quick! Quick! Comrades. We are free. The SS... has fled. The camp is in our hands. Maintain discipline. There must be no chaos. No lynchings. What did he say? We have to let the son of a bitch live. What a shame that I don't speak German. If you lynch them, we're no better than the SS murderers. Stop! Prisoner number... Wait, wait, wait, I ain't no fuckin' SS. Are you from one of the camps? Yes, sir. I'm a prisoner for four years. Oh, shit. Well, you'd better come with us, okay? We'll take you to our base. That way you'll be safe. -No, thank you sir. But... I must go home. Okay, buddy. You be careful out there. This place is still crawling full of SS. The war ain't over yet. You think I've forgotten you? Out! Get out of here! You must get out. Open up, you rats! Quick! It's over. You're free. What about the boy? Take the boy. From 1937 to 1945 250,000 people from around Europe were imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration camp. Over 50,000 died in the camp.
