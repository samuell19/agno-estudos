(bright music) - [Laura] It's the holiday season, and that only means one thing for sure. Santa is gearing up to travel all over, delivering presents far and wide. - [Dean] It's "Christmas Around the USA," Taking a closer look at how we celebrate around the country. ♪ It the best time of year ♪ ♪ For good times and cheer ♪ ♪ Happy holidays, happy holidays to you ♪ ♪ Happy holidays ♪ ♪ Happy holidays to you ♪ - Hello, and happy holidays. I'm Dean Cain. - And I'm Laura MaKenzie. Welcome to "Christmas Around the USA." - We are celebrating the holidays in over 25 states, each with different traditions, oh, and food. - Ah, who could forget the all important Christmas dinner? - [Dean] And desserts. - [Laura] And we definitely have some help along the way in the true holiday spirit. - That's right. We have Elizabeth Stanton hosting our Christmas concert, which is quite the event, as well as breaking down the more interesting and intricate holiday meals. - Well, I think it's time we get to the first stop on this merry adventure. - Yes, let's head on over to the Big Apple and see how they celebrate in the big city. - [Laura] New York City, the city that never sleeps, and I'm willing to bet it's Santa's secondary headquarters, a great place for him to stay up and make sure he is seeing who winds up on the nice list this year. - [Dean] From snowy strolls through Central Park to the various outdoor ice skating rinks, oh, and in true New Yorker fashion, the last minute shopping. No matter where you turn, the city is filled with holiday cheer. - [Laura] New York City has always been filled with excitement, but come the holiday season, it takes on a whole new festive approach. The building facades turn into light shows to celebrate the occasion, bringing New Yorkers and tourists alike together to embrace the holidays. - [Dean] There is one tradition that seems to be one of the oldest, however, and that's the lighting of the tree at Rockefeller Center and getting in a little bit of ice skating. Every year, one tree is hand selected, standing over 75 feet tall and covered in over 50,000 lights. - [Laura] That's spectacle is what brings everyone together ringing in the holiday season. - [Dean] So if you can brave the cold and love a great spectacle, not to mention some pretty amazing pizza, I'd say Christmas in New York is definitely one to add to your list. Okay, let's head on over now to our nation's capitol because I hear they know how to celebrate the holidays. - Well, maybe Montel Williams can tell us a little bit about that. - I can't wait to show you Christmas in Washington DC. Plane, train, automobile, whichever you choose, let's head up north. Here we are in the nation's capital, Washington DC, where Christmas glows with a certain presidential spirit. What could be more beautiful than these marble monuments twinkling in Christmas lights? And it's not just the monuments of sparkle this time of the year. The White House Christmas tree Lighting is the most star studded holiday event in the Capitol with live performances from artists like LL Cool J, Patti LaBelle, Billy Porter, Chris Stapleton, Kristin Chenoweth, and H.E.R., with all new performers every single year. Washington DC brings out all the stops with celebrity guests and much, much more. - Five, four, three, two, one, Merry Christmas! (crowd clapping) - [Montel] Christmas in the nation's capitol brings everybody into the holiday spirit. - I think it's time we head over to our stage and see what's going on with our co-host, Elizabeth Stanton. - I can't wait to see our first performer kick off our Christmas celebrations. - Thank you, and happy holidays. I'm here live on our stage, ready to bring you some amazing performers that are bound to ring in the holiday season. (audience applauding) Let's take a look at a fresh take on an English traditional Christmas carol that goes all the way back to the 1600s. We have "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" performed by Blake Lewis. (audience applauding) - Happy holidays. (audience applauding) ♪ God rest ye merry gentlemen ♪ ♪ Let nothing you dismay ♪ ♪ Remember Christ our Savior ♪ ♪ Was born on Christmas Day ♪ ♪ To save us all from Satan's power ♪ ♪ When we have gone astray ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Oh comfort and joy ♪ ♪ In Bethlehem, in Israel ♪ ♪ The blessed Babe was born ♪ ♪ And laid within a manger ♪ ♪ Upon this blessed morn ♪ ♪ To which His Mother Mary ♪ ♪ Did nothing take in scorn ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Yeah, oh, comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ (Blake beatboxing) ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Merry, merry Christmas, y'all ♪ ♪ Happy holidays ♪ ♪ God rest ye merry gentlemen ♪ ♪ Let nothing you dismay ♪ ♪ Remember Christ our Savior ♪ ♪ Was born on Christmas Day ♪ ♪ To save us all from Satan's power ♪ ♪ When we have gone astray ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Hey, happy holidays ♪ ♪ Yeah, ooh ♪ (audience cheering) - Thank you, Liz. What an incredible performance. - We'll be right back with even more holiday cheer right here on "Christmas Around the USA." (bright music) (bright music) - Welcome back to "Christmas Around the USA." Let's continue our trip around the country to a state that everyone flocked to back in 1848. - Everybody wanted to jump in on the Gold Rush, and once they got there, most people decided to stay. Let's hand it off to our co-host, Montel Williams, to take a closer look. - Well, thanks so much, Laura and Dean. Look, we're off to the Golden State of California. California from beaches to big cities to the beautiful snowy mountains, it's tough to choose where to start in this state. You have plenty of options, so we might as well start with a little Christmas shopping or a nice walk down the beautifully decorated Rodeo Drive. In fact, you'll come to realize that pretty much everywhere you look it's covered in Christmas decorations from shopping centers to hotels and, of course, the neighborhoods. And it's been like this for so long, as long as we can remember. California is one of the few states, where come Christmas Day, you can find yourself enjoying the beach and surfing or marveling at the mountains while you're skiing or maybe even doing both in the same day. There's one standout tradition dating all the way back to 1907 that you absolutely must see, and that's the Christmas Boat Festival in Newport Beach. Here you'll see wonderfully illuminated boats sailing all around, lighting up the water in a magical display of Christmas cheer. You might even see Santa arrive on a jet pack. Whether you hop aboard a boat or you sit back and watch hundreds of them pass you by, you're in for a very special treat. Christmas in California is really hard to beat. - Our next holiday destination is definitely fun, especially if you like sledding and ice skating during the holidays. New Orleans, Louisiana. - Wait, wait a minute. Sledding in New Orleans? - Yep, if you know where to go. And here's radio DJ, Fresh Johnson, to show us around the NOLA Christmasfest. - Here are just a few ways that New Orleans celebrates the holiday season. This is your go-to family friendly destination for carnival rides, gingerbread houses, and Christmas trees, and a few particular standouts, ice slides and a real life ice skating rink. You know, all the good stuff. Y'all, I'll be candid, this is my first time on skates. Wish me luck. So the good news is I didn't fall. The bad news, I may not make the cut for the Winter Olympics, but it's all good because they're so much more to see. - Wow, that looks like a lot of fun. - It does, but come on, Fresh. New Orleans is not really famous for cold weather sports, right? - Chances are you are not gonna get a white Christmas in New Orleans, but don't mistake that for a lack of holiday spirit. This city has cheered to spare year round, and that's double true during the most wonderful time of the year. - [Dean] Yes, there is so much happening during the holidays in New Orleans. - [Laura] Another fun thing to do is just stroll through the neighborhood to see how this beautiful city decorates. You're gonna find some pretty spectacular houses. - [Dean] And if you want an even closer look, you can take a holiday home tour run by the Preservation Resource Center. - [Laura] After that, you can head to Canal Street, decked out with wreaths, trees, and holiday imagery, drawing visitors in droves to enjoy the sparkling lights. - [Dean] Celebration in the Oaks is another New Orleans holiday family favorite. This incredible light festival has enchanted park visitors since the 1980s. Today, this city park remains a not to miss highlight for the season. - [Laura] In New Orleans, hotels go big for the holidays, too. ♪♪ When it opened 125 years ago, The Roosevelt wowed the city with an over the top decoration of its block long lobby for Christmas. It's a tradition that continues to this day, making it a local icon of the holiday season. - [Dean] Perhaps more than anything else, New Orleans is known for its amazing food. And, of course, they have something extra special cooked up for the holidays. It's the Réveillon dinner. - [Laura] In French, the word Réveillon means awakening. The Creoles celebrated the start of Christmas in the early 1800s with a feast. - [Dean] These days, restaurants all over town offer Réveillon menus throughout the month of December, and be sure to bring your appetite because when they say feast, they mean it. - [Elizabeth] Christmas dinners around the USA, New Orleans. The weather may be cooler around the holiday season, but this Christmas meal down south is bound to heat things up. Looking for some spicy tasty Cajun cuisine to ring in the holiday season? Around Christmas time, a Cajun classic adorns the dinner tables of many Louisiana homes. A spicy steamy pot of gumbo filled with andouille sausage, chicken, seafood, okra, oysters, crab meat, peppers, onions, celery, and more, gumbo makes for a mouthwatering holiday feast. There's nothing like a good bowl of gumbo to fill you up and bring your family together for the holidays. - Hmm, is it just me, or could you go for a little gumbo right now? - Ooh, sounds so good, but stick around because there's a lot more "Christmas Around the USA" after this. (bright music) (bright music) Well, D, for our next stop on this little sleigh ride, we're gonna head down to a more tropical climate. - Ooh, Hawaii, Puerto Rico? - Close, Florida. - Ah, that was my next guess. Florida. Now, just because it isn't snowing down south, that doesn't stop them from enjoying the holiday season. - [Laura] The state may be filled with palm trees rather than your traditional Christmas trees, but that hasn't stopped Floridians from decorating them all the same. You might even say they're even more creative than the snow covered states this time of year. - [Dean] From city squares to practically every building you see, even the harbors see some holiday cheer. Although it may be warmer, that does not stop them from filling the streets with that Christmas spirit. - [Laura] There's one thing about celebrating the holidays in a state filled with beaches. Turns out Santa has a hobby none of us knew about, and it's not just relaxing in the sand. Every year, the masses come to join in or just watch the spectacle that's the Surfing Santa event. (crowd cheering) - Merry Christmas. Let's take a picture. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas. - [Dean] Now, how did this get started? Cocoa Beach local, George Trosset, called up his son with this wacky idea. Let's dress up in Santa Claus attire and hit the waves on Christmas Eve. - [Laura] Well, word quickly spread, and now thousands of Santas join the Trossets every year to celebrate Christmas. The tradition quickly grew from three to more than 500 surfing Santas. Eventually, even a group of skydiving Santas joined in. - [Dean] And the best part, onlookers bring toys to donate to children in need come Christmas time. What an amazing way to celebrate in the spirit of Christmas. - [Laura] So if you want a white sand holiday instead of snow, Florida is the place to go. - [Elizabeth] Christmas dinners around the USA, Florida. Let's check in and see how this tropical state celebrates the holidays. Well, more importantly, how they eat. Come Christmastime down in Florida, you won't often find gingerbread cookies or fruitcakes or any of those traditional holiday treats on the dinner table. Not to say they aren't great, but down south they have an affinity for key lime pie with graham cracker crust and the perfect zingy, tangy and perfectly balanced sweet filling. Outside of the whipped cream, of course, that's pure sugar, but that whipped cream is the closest you'll get to a white Christmas in Florida. - You know, when we picture Christmas, for a lot of us, we think of snow. - Yes. - Well, this location has snow at least six months every year. - Ah, Alaska. Can we go ice fishing? - Yes. - Yes! Up and up we keep on going as close to the North Pole as we can get, Alaska. Here live native reindeer. - [Laura] Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. And who can forget our Rudolph? Come to a reindeer farm and meet them yourself. - [Dean] There's not just reindeer here in Alaska. In Alaska, residents celebrate Christmas in January, and they celebrate with Selaviq. - [Laura] In Selaviq, day after day, parishioners visit their neighbor's homes, sing to them, and lift their Christmas spirits all while spinning a wooden star, the beacon of Bethlehem. And to finish it all off, a feast at every home. What a way to celebrate. - [Dean] Top it all off with a visit to the North Pole. Alaska, a year round Christmas village, and wow, what a Christmas in Alaska. - Dean, I don't know about you, but Christmas music is what gets me into the spirit for the holidays. - Absolutely. I could not agree more, and I think we're due for another performance. So let's send it over to Elizabeth Stanton and see what's going on on stage. - Now we have a Welsh Christmas Carol dating back to the 16th century. Let's welcome a trio of very talented singers performing "Deck the Halls." Here's The Sugarplums. (audience applauding) (upbeat music) ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding ♪ ♪ Ding dong ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ Ding, ding ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding ♪ ♪ See the blazing yule before us ♪ ♪ Fa la la la ♪ ♪ Strike the harp and join the chorus ♪ ♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ While I tell of Yuletide treasure ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ♪ ♪ Sing we joyous all together ♪ ♪ Sing we joyous all together ♪ ♪ Sing we joyous all together ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la la ♪ (audience applauding) - Another incredible performance, but stick around, we have even more performances to enjoy and states to celebrate. - Right here on "Christmas Around the USA." (bright music) (bright music) We're traveling all across the country. - Kind of like Santa. - Yes, very much, but without the reindeer. Speaking of which, I think it's time we head to the desert where you will be hard pressed to find one. - That's true because we are going to Arizona. We've seen our snowy holiday cities and towns around the US, but to the Southwest, Christmas in Arizona is a world away. - [Dean] From the Grand Canyon to wild west frontier towns, Arizona has a lot to offer. - [Laura] But how do you get a Christmas tree out here in the desert? One year, an Arizona town took a unique spin on this Christmas quandary. - [Dean] Story has it that one year, without a Christmas tree in sight, residents got the bright idea to make one themselves with what they had lying around. - [Laura] What better way in the wild west than a tumbleweed tree? So began the tradition every year to save a tree and decorate some tumbleweed. Merry Christmas, Arizona. - You know, I think it's time we head home for the holidays, but not my home, your home state, Laura. - Oh, well, I can definitely show you around. I mean, we have barbecue, we have history, and the Arch. We are off to Missouri, or as we say, Missouri. Off we go to Missouri. Come on and meet us in St. Louis. From its iconic Arch to the historic naval ships and the old Victorian and Americana architecture, Missouri is truly a sight to see, but come the holiday season, the city and suburbs become snow covered wonderlands with one interesting hobby locals love to partake in, bird watching. So grab a comfy spot and a pair of binoculars and enjoy some aviary Christmas magic. Christmas in Missouri is a nature lover's dream. - [Elizabeth] Christmas dinners around the USA. Missouri. We all love the classics. Well, this is one of the oldest traditional meals. Let's take a look. Here in the gateway to the West, food is what the holidays are all about. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Missourian's love the holiday classic, Christmas fruitcake. Fruitcakes have been around since before the dawn of Christmas and have at times even been outlawed for being too decadent. But Missourian's love a good fruitcake and these cakes last one heck of a long time. Why? The sugar and boozy contents from these cakes from honey dried fruits and rum make them last for quite a while. One family claims to have been passing a homemade fruitcake down generations after generations for 141 years. These cakes hit their Christmas heyday in the Middle Ages but the oldest fruitcake found so far was uncovered in an Egyptian tomb, dated to be a whopping 4176 years old. For the Trappist Monks of Assumption Abbey, near Ava, Missouri, baking is no commercial enterprise. It's a way of life. Their delicious fruitcakes are made with raisins, pineapple, currants, orange and lemon peel, walnuts, wine and rum, spicy and delicious. These fruitcakes are sure to wet your holiday appetite. - You know, Dean, this state doesn't sound like a bad spot to spend the holidays. Tropical beaches, amazing mountains and some incredible Christmas traditions, all their own. - Well with all of that in the mix, there's only one place I can think of and that is Hawaii. - Yes. - [Dean] Mele Kalikimaka. Let's make our way across the Pacific to the most tropical of all the states, Hawaii. - [Laura] While there's no snow to be found in this tropical oasis of Hawaii here islanders celebrate Christmas in true Hawaiian style. Now how does Santa get to Hawaii? Well, he can't exactly buy a plane ticket. - [Dean] No, no, no planes necessary. In Hawaii, Santa arrives by outrigger canoe pulled by what you wonder? Who else? A team of loyal Christmas dolphins. Yes. Santa and Mrs. Claus know how to travel in style. - [Laura] And they're headed to the main event, a Kalua pig roast. Hope you're hungry for some Christmas ham. Slow cooked to perfection in a natural sand pit. This native Hawaiian tradition produces tender juicy pork that's sure to be a Christmas dinner you won't soon forget. - [Dean] As the Kahlua pig roasts, enjoy time with family and friends on the beach on one of the most beautiful islands in the world. Mele Kalikimaka to one and all. - [Laura] Let's check in with co-host Elizabeth Stanton to see how our concert's doing. - Thanks, Laura and Dean. From her new holiday album, "Winterlicious," we have, "I Wish Every Day was Christmas" by Debbie Gibson.

We'll be right back with even more performances, delicious meals and unique state traditions. - Right here on "Christmas Around The USA." (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Hello, and welcome back to "Christmas Around The USA." - All right, let's head off to our next state. And you know, we are flying through these. - Just like Santa. - That's right. We are, just like Santa. And next is a Midwest state filled with college towns and some pretty amazing scenery. - Nebraska. Let's take a look. - [Dean] The great state of Nebraska. Here in the heartland, Christmas brings the family together. And what better way than to celebrate Nebraskan history over at Buffalo Bill's ranch. - [Laura] In North Platte, Nebraska, Christmas is on at the Buffalo Bill Ranch. The air is alive with the Christmas spirit, the scent of chestnuts roasting on an open fire, steaming apple cider and delicious Christmas cookies wafting through the air. It's hard to keep your mouth from watering. Since it became a state historical park in 1965, William F. Buffalo Bill Cody's house has been restored and a wealth of Cody memorabilia is on display. - [Dean] Christmas at the Cody's invites visitors into the Buffalo Bill mansion. Decorated to the hilt with holiday spirit. Visitors take in the glory of the old frontier days when "Buffalo Bill's Wild West" was the wildest show in town. - [Laura] Visitors can take a hayride through the grounds, a tour of the barn, and even get to meet Santa himself. - Okay, let's jet over to the Centennial State named because they got their statehood a hundred years after America's independence. - Could be because the capital is a mile above sea level. Might have just taken people that long to get there. - I'm not too sure about that but I know someone who'll be the best tour guide. Let's check in with Montel Williams. - It may be home to Mile High City, but it didn't take them a hundred years to scale up to Denver. I can say that this state brings Christmas to whole new heights. Here's Colorado. Let's scoot on over to the Rocky Mountains and see Colorado in all its Christmas cheer. The Rocky Mountains offer some of the best skiing in the United States featuring top spots like Vail, Aspen, and Telluride. Grab your snowshoes. Here, foot upon foot of snow graces the slopes. There's nothing quite like these beautiful mountains to send you careening into the Christmas spirit. Colorado skiers know how to celebrate. Have you ever seen Santa after Santa after Santa skiing down a mountain? Come on over to Crested Butte where you'll see countless Santas skiing making this one of the largest skiing Santa events in the world. With so many Santas in one place, you'll have to believe you'll get whatever's on your wishlist. - [Laura] And if you can't get enough winter fun, Elizabeth Stanton recently found one of the best places in the country for skiing. Sun Valley, Idaho. - Sun Valley was created over 85 years ago in 1936 with a summit of 9150 feet and over 2000 acres of terrain. When seen from above, this looks a bit like what I imagine the North Pole might look like. It's no surprise this wound up being America's first travel ski destination. But it's not just the amazing landscape and mountain that first brought tourists to this town. One of the biggest sells has to be the invention that changed the sport of skiing. The first chairlift. And it was fashioned right here by repurposing a banana hauler. Wow, what a beautiful day to go skiing. (upbeat music) The ski slopes are incredible. Even a group of Santas joined in. The spirit of Christmas is everywhere you look. What a way to celebrate Christmas! Tada. All right, let's go inside for some hot chocolate. This is work. (laughter) All right, let's go. We had such a great day on the mountain but now it's time to kick back and relax. - That looks like a blast. You know, Dean, I think we should take a look at another famous skiing destination. - Mm. Switzerland. - In the US. - Switzerland's not-- No no. Switzerland's not in the US. That's right. Can I have a hint? - Sure. Bison. - Well, that's easy. Wyoming. - Yes. (laughter) - Wyoming, home of Yellowstone National Park. But it's also home to extreme winter sports near Grand Teton Mountain. Snow mobiling, skiing, whitewater rafting, and some beautiful sights to see like waterfalls and of course bison. If that wasn't enough, stick around. And if you're lucky, at certain times of the year you'll even catch the Aurora Borealis over the famous mountain peaks. And if you're lucky, you might just find another outpost for Santa and his reindeer. Christmas in Wyoming is every outdoorsman's picture perfect holiday. Okay, let's take a break from the slopes and head over to our co-host, Elizabeth Stanton. - Thanks, Laura and Dean. Based on the 1843 French poem we have one of the most iconic songs with renditions dating back to the 1800s. Here's "Oh, Holy Night," performed by Brandon Rogers.

(upbeat music) (upbeat music) - We're back. Welcome to "Christmas Around The USA." Now our next stop is home to over 29 million people spanning over 265,000 square miles. - Wow, that is a lot of chimneys. - Let's see how they like to spend the holiday season in-- - [Both] Texas. - [Dean] Texas. Christmas cheer rings out in every corner of the state. - [Laura] Whether it's the San Antonio River Walk or Christmas trees in Addison. Texas knows how to light up the night with Christmas cheer. - [Dean] But the commotion come the holiday season isn't just decorations, it's the food. - [Laura] Let's send this over to Elizabeth Stanton to break down what the talk of the town is during Christmas time. - Christmas dinners around the USA. Texas. Let's head over and see what's cooking during the holidays. At Christmas time in Texas it's not Turkey and ham that folks feast on for dinner. Texans enjoy a quintessential Mexican delicacy come Christmas. Tamales. Every Christmas, The line for tamales wrap around the block of favorite tamale shops across the state. This staple is made from freshly ground corn complete with a savory filling of meat or vegetables and a corn husk to wrap it all up in. If you have a sweet tooth, enjoy tamales filled with dried fruit. Feliz Navidad from Texas. - Let's head south-east. Right off the shores of the Atlantic. Filled with fine arts, state parks and massive mountains. Not to mention some great holiday traditions. - All right, then let's check in for a North Carolina Christmas. - That's what I was thinking. - North Carolina. Here we are, nestled in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. - [Dean] These mountains attract tourists from all over the world to ride the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway. Some visitors even ship their motorcycles from overseas. This thrill ride is their gift for Christmas. - [Laura] Through the Misty Air, we go to find Chimney Rock. What better place to see Santa than in his element, climbing down the chimney. - [Dean] Legend has it that Santa climbs down the chimney bringing Christmas gifts to all the good children, reads messages and wishlists and sneaks some late night cookies and milk as he goes. - [Laura] At Chimney Rock, spot Santa himself, along with one of his trusty elves, rappelling down the chimney. - [Dean] You might even get an autograph from the one and only Santa Claus. I hear his payment is in the form of cookies and milk. All right. Maybe it's the time of the year or all the decorations that we've been seeing, but I cannot get some of these Christmas songs out of my head. - Well, that's a good thing, right? - Well, yeah, I guess it is, but I'm ready for a new one. - Okay, then let's send it over to Elizabeth Stanton and see what song is up next. - And that'll be stuck in my head. - Thanks guys.

Lots of food. - Oh, yes. (bright cheerful music) (bright cheerful music) - Christmas is often associated with evergreen trees, frigid climates, and a warm fireplace to escape to inside. - Well, our next stop instead has tropical rainforests, warm weather, and waterfalls. And with a location as beautiful as this, you'll wanna stay outdoors. - Yeah. Let's take a peak at Puerto Rico. (cheerful festive music) (sledge swoops) (upbeat music) - [Laura] Off we go again across the ocean to the island of Puerto Rico. - [Dean] Puerto Rico is home to one of the longest Christmas celebrations in the world Here, there aren't just 12 days of Christmas, there are almost two whole months. From Thanksgiving all the way through late January, Puerto Rico is alive with the Christmas spirit. - [Laura] Puerto Rico is home to the tradition of parrandas. Parrandas involves a group of merry carolers arriving at a neighbor's doorstep all in the middle of the night. They wake up their sleeping neighbors with their singing and don't stop until they're allowed inside and given something to eat or drink. And this carries on all the way 'till dawn. - [Dean] These make for some of the sweetest memories of the holiday season. Like this celebration with the Alvarado family in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Singing together brings out the true spirit of the holidays. - [Laura] After all that's singing and celebrating, everyone's ready for some delicious Puerto Rican food. To mark the end of the Christmas season, Puerto Ricans celebrate with the San Sebastian street festival, where there's dancing and music, and a parade of people dressed up with enormous heads representing different figures in Puerto Rican culture. - [Dean] Feliz Navidad from Puerto Rico. (upbeat music continues) - Okay, let's take a trip to the very end of the Appalachian Trail. Can you guess? It's known for lighthouses and Christmas lobster. - I knew it after you said, "The Appalachian Trail." Te, no, Maine. - Maine. (cheerful festive music) Let's head all the way up to the very northeastern tip of the US to the state of Maine. The ski slopes are incredible, and once a year Santa's helpers gather to celebrate this winter wonderland. - This is my first Santa Sunday and I love it. I'll definitely be back. Ho, ho, ho! - [Laura] Santa Sunday is something you have to see to believe. The spirit of Christmas is everywhere you look. - [Skiers] Ho, ho, ho! - [Laura] Skiing in that classic big red suit. -So there's nothing like seeing over 200 Santas on the slopes to get you in the holiday spirit. (bright cheerful music) - [Laura] After a long day of festivities, Mainers like to curl up with their famous Maine Coon cats for some hot, world-class seafood. And here's Elizabeth Stanton to tell you all about it. (bright cheerful music continues) - Christmas dinners around the USA. Maine. Check the line, we're going fishing for a whole new Christmas dinner delight. Mainers are famous for their love of seafood. Whether it's lobster rolls, crab cakes, or mussels, Mainers know how to eat some seafood. Come the holidays, that's when they crank it up a notch when there's snow on the ground and a warm clam chowder cooking on the stove. That's when it feels most like Christmas. A classic clam chowder includes clam juice, flour, onions, pork fat, butter, clams, potatoes, milk and cream, and cooks up into one delicious, hearty holiday meal. There's nothing quite like a clam chowder Christmas. (cheerful festive music) - Our next destination is known for southern hospitality, the birthplace to many influential Americans and your favorite fruit. - Mine? Peaches. - Oh. - Peaches. We must be going - [Hosts] to Georgia. (bright upbeat music) - [Dean] Down we go to Georgia to celebrate Christmas in the Deep South. - [Laura] Atlanta has so much to offer come Christmas time. Whether it's ice skating at Atlantic Station, or enjoying a Bavarian Christmas market in Centennial Park, Atlanta knows how to bring people together and celebrate in style. - [Dean] Some all-natural Christmas charm, Atlanta residents head to the city's beautiful Botanical Gardens. Atlanta's Botanical Gardens are a sight to see all year round, but over the holidays, wow! The garden nights and holiday lights offer stunning displays to bring the people out in droves for the holiday spirit. - [Laura] Add some hologram glasses to enhance the light displays and train rides, and you're sure to have a holiday celebration for all ages. (bright upbeat music) - [Dean] Let's send it over to Elizabeth Stanton and see what's going on on stage. (audience applauds) - Starting the holiday season off with her album Winterlicious, we have "The Gift" by none other than Debbie Gibson. (audience applauds) (audience cheers) (gentle piano music) ♪ I'm warm enough to face the night ♪ ♪ With nothing but your love wrapped 'round me ♪ ♪ I'm coming from a place of light ♪ ♪ I'm nothing like the way you found me ♪ ♪ Stay a moment and play ♪ ♪ I'm needing this day to melt the cold ♪ ♪ And all my fears fade away ♪ ♪ 'Cause your love is all there is ♪ ♪ Your love is December's kiss ♪ ♪ I just tore up, tore up my list ♪ ♪ 'Cause your love is the gift ♪ (gentle piano music continues) ♪ I've wanted far too much too long ♪ ♪ By all the glitter I was blinded ♪ ♪ But now I sing a different song ♪ ♪ 'Cause in the heart is where I find it ♪ ♪ All the things that I need ♪ ♪ Are the things they can't see ♪ ♪ Or take away ♪ ♪ Right here is where they'll stay ♪ ♪ 'Cause your love is what I'll miss ♪ ♪ Your love is December's kiss ♪ ♪ I just tore up, tore up my list ♪ ♪ 'Cause your love is the gift ♪ (gentle piano music continues) ♪ Da, da, da ♪ ♪ Da, dum, dum ♪ (gentle piano music continues) ♪ Ooo ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Ooo ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ (gentle piano music continues) ♪ 'Cause your love is all there is ♪ ♪ Your love is December's kiss ♪ ♪ I just tore up, tore up my list ♪ ♪ 'Cause your love is the gift ♪ ♪ Yeah, your love is the gift ♪ (gentle piano music fades out) (audience applauds) (audience cheers) (bright upbeat music) - Stick around for even more incredible holiday traditions coming up. - Right here on "Christmas Around the USA". (bright upbeat music) (bright upbeat music) - Our next state is home to over 10,000 lakes and Lake Superior, the largest great lake. Come the holiday season, they make pretty good ice rinks. - Let's skate over to Minnesota, hey? (bright upbeat music) (sledge swoops) - [Dean] Let's hang around up north and head over to Minnesota. - [Laura] Bundle up for Christmas in Minnesota. Ice fishing, snowmobiling and winter festivals make the holidays in Minnesota one of the most wonderful times of the year. - [Dean] But outside of all that outdoors fun, it's something that happens inside on the dinner table that we might need a little more explanation from Elizabeth Stanton. - Christmas dinners around the USA. Minnesota. Hungry? Minnesotans have just the thing for you, an unusual holiday meal that's not for the faint of heart. Madison prides itself as the lupus capital of the world. Here every Christmas they eat lupus. Now, what is lupus? It's a traditional Scandinavian delicacy. Dried cod is soaked in a lye solution for days and days. Lye like the soap? Yep, that's the one. But then it's soaked in water and end result being a perfect little morsel of extremely tender fish as the lye breaks down all the chewy proteins. Like I said, it might not be for everybody, but up in Madison, Minnesota, it is a delicacy come the holiday season. (title whooshes) - Time to check in on our next home for the holidays. From the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, at first glance you might think you're in your own little North Pole. - Filled with glacier parks and snow-capped peaks, we're heading to Montana. (bright upbeat music) (sledge whooshes) - [Laura] The big, beautiful state of Montana. Here in the Big Sky state, take in the gorgeous spectacle of nature. - [Dean] Whether it be at Glacier National Park or the Lewis and Clark Caverns, or Big Horn Canyon, Montana is a beautiful sight to behold. Come Christmas, the ice is thick enough to climb. - [Laura] Ice climbers from all over come to the Bozeman Ice Climbing Festival for the holidays. Meet climbers, see heart pounding climbing feats on the silver screen and hear real life tales from the crags. - [Dean] The Bozeman Ice Climbing Festival is a fascinating spot for climbers and land lovers alike. Merry Christmas from Montana. (bright upbeat music) - Okay, it's time to check back in and see how our concert's going with Elizabeth Stanton. - Elizabeth, take it away. - Thanks, Laura and Dean. Let's bring up this incredible singer and performer with his rendition of this classic carol, "The First Noel". We have Elliot Yamin.

(bright upbeat music) (bright upbeat music) (cheerful music) All right, we're back with even more "Christmas Around the USA". - And I am ready for our next stop. Where are we heading, Laura? - Well, this state is famous for being framed where our nation's four great lakes- - To Michigan! - I had more to say. - Oh, but I know. It's Michigan. - You're very confident. Is that your final answer? - I was born there. That's my final answer. It's Michigan. - He's right. - And so it is. We're off to Michigan. (Laura chuckles) (bright upbeat music) (sledge swoops) The holidays in Michigan. - [Laura] What better place to dive into Christmas than a real live Christmas village in Frankenmuth, Michigan? - [Dean] Here in Michigan's Little Bavaria, it's festival season all year round. Frankenmuth celebrates Bavarian classics like Octoberfest, including wiener dog races, classic cars with the Autofest and the Frankenmuth Dog Bowl, the world's largest festival for dogs. Frankenmuth is always festive, but around Christmas, now this is something magical. - [Laura] The epicenter of Christmas cheer in Michigan lies at Frankenmuth Village. Visitors can shop at Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, the world's largest Christmas decoration store, which houses a whopping seven acres of Christmas decorations. - [Dean] Visitors from all over the world stock up on Christmas goodies at Bronner's, whether it's ornaments, trims, trees, Christmas lights, garlands, stockings, advent calendars, or wreaths, Christmas spirit is in no short supply up here in the heart of Michigan. (bright upbeat music) - Well, if you've ever been to this next location, you'd know it's famous for its national parks and it's skiing. - Some say it looks a little bit like Mars. - Skiing and Mars? Yes, we're going to Utah. (bright upbeat music) (sledge swoops) Christmas out west to the majestic state of Utah. - [Dean] Here in Utah, winter time brings out the gorgeous mountain scenery. Whether it's checking out the Bonneville Salt Flats, skiing in Park City or venturing south towards jaw-dropping rock formations, there are unforgettable sites to see no matter where you go. - [Laura] Listen closely around Christmas time and you'll hear angelic voices ringing out in celebration of the holidays. Every year, Salt Lake City's Tabernacle Choir puts on the biggest show of its 75 performance season, ranked as one of the 10 best choirs in the world with over 360 members. - [Dean] Around the holidays, their Christmas concert includes "Carol of the Bells", "Hark the Harold Angels Sing", "Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly", and many, many more. Joy to the world indeed. (bright upbeat music) We have Elizabeth Stanton standing by on our stage ready to bring out the next holiday performance. - Let's welcome the whimsical workings of a magician who brings the magic of Christmas to life. Here's Murray SawChuck. (audience applauds) (audience cheers) - Hey, everybody, how are you? Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. One of my favorite things about Christmas is breakfast. I love getting up as a kid, having breakfast, and I always did this trick where I take a handkerchief, I put it inside my fist just like this. Every year I'd do it. My family knew what I was doing, but they'd go with it. I'd snap my fingers and go, "What color does the handkerchief change into?" And they'd go, "I don't know." And go, "Well, it changes into an egg. And the red handkerchief's actually here in my pocket." And they'd always clap, and they always loved it and hopefully it fooled you guys right now. But I always like to teach tricks. I'm gonna teach you how this works. First of all, you get a red handkerchief. Second of all, you get an egg and you cut a hole in the back of the egg. It's super simple just like that. An egg and two handkerchiefs, all right? So when you go shopping, the idea's that I would get two handkerchiefs but make sure they're the same color. If not, it probably won't work, all right? First thing you do is take this red handkerchief and you roll into a tiny ball just like this. This is so you can actually manipulate it a little bit easier, right? That goes in the right pocket, all right? The egg goes in the right pocket as well. Why? Because I'm right-handed, all right? So if you happen to be left-handed, my suggestion's to put the stuff in your left pocket, all right? Then what you do is basically something called palming. I need to teach you, all right? It's kinda where you hold an egg right here in the palm, top and bottom, hold together, and your fingers wrap around it. So when you hold it like this, you can't see it, all right? At least you shouldn't, all right? And the red handkerchief goes in the left pocket. Second of all, I wear a hoodie that has big pockets so I can get my hands in and outta the pockets, that's very important. So here's how you start. You pull up the red handkerchief and you wave it up and down. It's called misdirection, okay? Or, you can just smack 'em in the face and they go blind for three seconds. (audience laughing) I don't advise that though. When you take the egg, you sneak it right out. Put it right down by your side. Don't start waving it around looking for a taxi, it's not the time. (audience laughing) Then you take the red handkerchief, and you push it into the old fist of mystery. Well, it's not much of a mystery, 'cause I've already told you it's going into the egg, exactly. So make sure you push it all the way in there. Don't be sloppy. 'Cause if for some reason when you push it all the way in here, but for some reason it doesn't go all the way in, it's gonna come out with half the handkerchief hanging out the back of it. Looking like Humpty Dumpty with a cape. And if he had a cape, he wouldn't have fallen. Snap the fingers like this, boom. There's your egg, reach in here. Bam, red handkerchief, just like this. (audience laughing) Red, green, same color. If you're closing your eyes. But the reason, if you have a green handkerchief here, you have to have a green handkerchief inside the egg. Very similar. Oh, you don't, you don't understand what I'm doing? Well, here's what you, if you get caught with this and they do see the hole, just use your magic powers and snap your finger, and then just take the hole right off. (audience exclaiming) See, there's no hole anymore. And take the egg, and then you just crack it. So you have a real egg, just like that. (audience clapping) Merry Christmas, you guys. Happy Holidays. (gentle cheerful music) - We have even more 'Christmas Around The USA'. - Coming up right after this. (gentle cheerful music) (gentle cheerful music) - Welcome back to 'Christmas Around The USA'. - We're exploring the entire country to find the most interesting holiday traditions, and the best holiday meals. - Not to mention, some great performances along the way. But, but I have to know, I have to know. Where are we off to next, Laura? - Well, Dean, you have a 50/50 shot at this one. We're going to a state that ends in Dakota. - Well, North Dakota, the only state I haven't visited. - That's right. Good guess. - Oh, I got it right. All right. It's a little holiday magic right there. (gentle cheerful music) - [Laura] North Dakota is known for its farmlands, and beautiful wide open spaces. What better way to take it easy and enjoy the holidays than in the good old fashioned small towns of North Dakota. In the town of Medora, you can come enjoy an old fashioned cowboy Christmas, complete with hay rides and holiday buffets. Visitors are transported back to the Wild West in cheery Christmas fashion. So, if you are looking for a nice and quiet Christmas, North Dakota is the place to go. Because I'm almost positive there's more animals than people out here. - Well, I think we would both get some coal in our stockings if we didn't visit the other state that ends in Dakota. - Ah, that's a risk I don't wanna take. And I also hear they have some incredible Christmas food down there - Sold. To my dad's home state of South Dakota. (gentle bright music) - [Laura] South Dakota is famous for its incredible landmarks, and breathtaking scenery. Of all the places in the USA, where else can you see historical icons faces carved into mountainsides? Like at Mount Rushmore, and the Crazy Horse Memorial. The beautiful Rocky Badlands, an incredible place for all kinds of critters, both day and night. You can even go panning for nuggets of gold. Christmas in South Dakota is perfect for any history buff, or someone who just has an adventurous spirit. (gentle bright music) - Let's check in with co-host, Elizabeth Stanton, and see what's up next. - The holiday season is all about giving. This magician has a gift for everyone. Here's Murray SawChuck. (audience clapping) (audience cheering) (gentle playful music) - What's up you guys? Merry Christmas, and happy holidays. This is my favorite time of year. And I love memories of Christmas. And one of my fondest memories, and funniest memories, is wrapping a present for my mom for Christmas. And she really wanted a pair of shoes. And so I actually wrapped a pair of shoes. (gentle playful music) But what I didn't remember is, I forgot to put the shoes inside the box. Well, this is exactly what happened. She opened it for Christmas Day, and there was nothing inside the box. Nothing at all. And I thought, oh no. And I remembered I left the shoes underneath my bed 'cause I didn't want her to see them. She wanted these shoes for a long time. As a magician, though, I knew what to do. I took back the box, I did this, and I said, mom, here's your shoes. And she got herself a brand new pair of shoes for Christmas. (audience clapping) (audience cheering) - Now it's time to head over to a state filled with snow capped volcanic mountains, rainy days, and tons of parks. - Ooh, you almost had me there with volcanic. but we've seen Hawaii. - Yeah. - So it has to be Washington? - Did the rain give it away? - That was a good hint, yes. But something tells me this time of the year, it's covered in snow instead. (gentle bright music) - [Dean] Here in Washington, the coffee capital of the USA, Christmas brings out some of the most classic ways to celebrate the holidays. - [Laura] Whether it's enjoying the beautiful Mount St. Helens, touring Puget Sound, grabbing some fresh fish at Pike Place Fish Market, whale watching, or dancing in the rain. Washington transforms into a wonderland during the holidays. - [Dean] Especially when you get what Seattleites hope for, a snowy Christmas in the Pacific Northwest. When there's snow on the ground and Christmas cheer in the air, it's the perfect time for a sleigh ride. Visitors slide through the beautiful mountain scenery, and on through to a magical Christmas village. - [Laura] This is Washington's Bavarian Christmas village in Leavenworth. Since the early 1960's, it's been a top tourist destination in the Pacific Northwest. Beginning in the early morning, complete with complimentary breakfast snacks and warm wool blankets, you'll board a horse pulled sleigh ride adventure that takes you on a beautiful tour of the Cascade Mountains, all the way to Red Tail farm. - [Dean] Your sleigh will bring you all the way to the authentic German town of Leavenworth, where you'll enjoy live outdoor entertainment, handcrafted food and beverages, and browse local artisans wares. - [Laura] What a way to celebrate Christmas. (gentle upbeat music) Okay, you ready to spice things up? Down to the land of the famous chili peppers, which, coincidentally, are green and red, spreading holiday cheer all year. - Now you're talking my language. Let's go to New Mexico. (gentle upbeat music) - [Dean] Christmas in New Mexico. Here in the Southwest, the unforgettable scenery takes you to a timeless way to celebrate the holidays. - [Laura] Here, with the warm days and cold desert nights, New Mexicans and visitors alike enjoy the incredible rock formations. Explore the eye-poppingly bright white sands at White Sands National Monument. Take in the beauty of the Rio Grande, and the great Gorge Bridge. And behold the mighty crags of Shiprock. - [Dean] In Santa Fe, the Christmas season is celebrated as a community. Kicking off with the Christmas Lighting Ceremony at the Santa Fe Plaza, all the way through to Christmas Eve, when revelers come to ring in the holiday with the annual Christmas Eve Farolito walk. - [Laura] On this night, locals and visitors head into the chilly night to take in beautiful local treasures, the crisp night air, and most of all, each other. The Christmas Eve Farolito walk is illuminated by luminarias. Small paper bags each with a candle illuminating the night. - [Dean] While most businesses are closed, the galleries remain open. And strollers enjoy over 100 art galleries as they stroll down the canyon. A beautiful way to celebrate the most wonderful time of the year. - Okay, let's head over to our co-host, Elizabeth Stanton. - Now, with an all original song, here's 'Winterheart' by singer- songwriter, Brandon Rogers.
