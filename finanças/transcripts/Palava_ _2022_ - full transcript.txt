In a week, 20 million naira will be ours to share after we kidnap you. Babe, we said 15 million naira. Okay wait, we said 15. You do the maths. Do the maths right now. What do you think five million naira can do for us? Come on, we still have to give Big T ten million naira from that. Come on, see, that money will be enough to put us right where we want to be. It's fucking Canada now. Baby, I know but that's a lot of money oh. Yes, it is but you can afford it. And your dad is about to sign a multimillion naira deal tomorrow. 50 million naira.

The title of her album is, "By myself." Alright? By myself I'm sure you can take a hint. I know but have you heard her new single? The music is not alive. She can make whatever kind of music she wants. But can't she tell? Imade, music is like a woman, okay? She wants you to possess her. And even after you've known her through and through, she wants you to be amazed by her, you know, like it's your first time. - You know what I mean? - [IMADE HISSES] Let's go. Ah. Oh, I see you brought Ofure. Charlie. Papa, her name is Charlie! Right. - Don't... - Mm-mm. I should not what? Don't... don't be mad... that you commissioned ten million naira for the documentary. [IN PIDGIN] Guy, if I slap you, you will carry that thing out of here. - Please leave this place! - Ini! Dad, ten million naira! How could you? Ten million. [IN ENGLISH] I know. I know baby, it's a lot of money but it's worth it. Dad, we can't afford to be spending money anyhow. Ini, I know it's a lot of money but when we sign the Buzz Cola deal we will be fine. Right? Daddy. That deal is fifty million naira. Listen to that. I love that song. That's your sister's song. Come on, girls. Let's go. Let's go support your sister. [WONDER] We shouldn't be sitting down here just, arguing. All right? [WONDER] Let's go. I need a drink and I'm sure you guys can use a drink as well. [WONDER] Let's go. [WONDER] Come on, girls! [INI] I can't believe this. [SIGHS] [WOMAN LAUGHING] - [WONDER] Ok babe, here. - Oh my God. What's going on? Why is everyone looking at me funny? - My name is Oma Bassey. - [BABY CRYING] And this is Osage Idehen's first son, Osage junior. [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] What is going on? I thought she was supposed to sign it yesterday. What does she want? More money? Because she's not getting any. She didn't say. That's why I came to tell you today. This is... [INI] How long was dad sleeping with your former assistant? I don't know. [INI] I don't understand. How could you not know? - [EHI] Big sis. - Is she not your former assistant? - [EHI] Big sis. - She was working for you, Imade! What? Your ex-assistant? Mad oh. [LAUGHING] [EHI] Wait like... I mean, Dad can keep secrets and all, but who would have thought that Oma is his type? Like, I mean, she could be somebody's type at the end of the day, but uh, Dad really doesn't have a spec. -Come Ehi, this is not funny. It's serious -[EHI SCOFFS] Why is she upset? Why is she so upset? Buzz Cola. They might pull out of the deal. - What? Why? - [MOBILE PHONE RINGING] [SNICKERING] Talk of the devil. He's calling now. Mr. Ekpe, good evening sir. You told me that that incident was a one-off, him on fighting stage What is going on? This completely unacceptable Completely unacceptable I cannot believe that this happened again Again?! What is going on? How are you sir? What is this that I'm hearing? Well, it's um, it's nothing sir. It's just a little misunderstanding. You know we cannot be in business with someone who abuses his power to sleep with an employee You understand we are a family company Sir, I totally understand. But let me tell you this... the thing is, she's actually his girlfriend. And you know it's just a publicity stunt. You know, buzz for Buzz Cola. [LAUGHING] Well, that was ill-advised Yes sir. But not to worry. Everything will be... shit... Shit! See, but wait, - Shit! - does Dad know that Oma is his girlfriend? Excuse me. [IN PIDGIN] I'm not available to babysit anybody though. That's my own. Osage has always loved the women. Especially the wrong kind of women. To be honest, it's always been a part of his charm. However, he's built his entire comeback on a family friendly image. The cuddling daddy of Daddy's girl not the one we've known in the past but over the last one week, we've seen the old Osa Wonder. The one who fights an MC over a woman And the one who gets his staff pregnant Rumor has it that Osage has spent a large part of his new fortune on medical expenses linked with his recent heart attack and he was counting on concerts and endorsements around his 60th birthday to refresh his coffers Will her overcome this latest scandal like he's always done in the past? Or will this new age of me too delay his comeback and send him and his family back to financial ruin? That was good, right? Wow, what a day! Okay let's go get some interviews with the guests. Yeah? [IMADE] What the hell were you thinking?! [WONDER] [SIGH] [IMADE] Hmm? Imade, I'm sorry. I... [WONDER] [SIGH] I wanted to tell you but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. - I didn't know how. - You didn't know how? You almost messed everything up for us. Do you know that Buzz Cola almost pulled out of that deal? I was handling it. Okay? I... I was handling it. She was supposed to sign an NDA and a settlement for ten million naira. And I don't know why she went public. Maybe she wants more money. Did you just say ten million? Ten million on top of the ten million for the documentary? Does Ini know about this? Don't give me that! How can you be defending him? Sis, it's Dad. This is what he does. I mean, he's usually more careful, you know. [CLICKS TONGUE] I wonder if she took advantage of him. As he said, this happened around the time of his heart attack. [CAR HOOTING] - After my heart attack, I... - [SCREAMING] Ah! I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear anything about that. I don't want to hear anything about that heart attack. I don't wanna hear it. Okay? I told Buzz Cola that she's your girlfriend. So, tell me, Osa Wonder, Wonder boy, is she gonna go with this story? Is she gonna stick to it? I don't know. Maybe she will want more money? The man has destroyed our lives again! Again and again! Shit! I can't believe this! He has done it again! [HISSES] - Ini! - [INI] What?! [CAR HOOTING] Red light. Ini, it was a red light. [SIREN BLARING] Ini, I think we're being followed. Ini! [INI] Why are they driving like mad people? Ini, they want us to stop. Ini stop now! Uh! Ini! - Ini. Ini. - Are you people mad? Ini. What is wrong with you? How can you stop like that? - Do you want to kill me? - Did you not see the traffic light? - What traffic light? - [CHUCKLES] I think you're joking. - [CLICKS TONGUE] - Come on... Don't touch me like that. - You think... - Don't touch me. What's wrong with you? You don't have any right to handle me like that. - You are under arrest. - Do you know who I am? - You will sleep in cell today. - I will deal with you. - You will sleep in cell today. - I will deal with you. Are you really quiet? [INI] Heh! Madam, you better take it easy. You don't know who I am oh. - Who are you? - Do you know who my father is? Who are you? You will sleep in cell today. - Ini, stop talking. - Calm down... Calm down please. [IMADE] After I do this... I'm serious papa, look at me. - After I do this... - [SOFT EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING] I'm done. I'm done. Tsk. Leave me alone.

No. Nigeria didn't suit her. Hajara had nothing to do with it. Yeah. Okay.

[OMA] Some things never change. [HUFFS]. I definitely do not have the energy for this drama. I'll pick it up tomorrow. What's wrong with this one? Please! [WONDER] Hajara, wait. [OMA] Please what are we eating oh? You know I'm a nursing mother. I have to eat. C'mon. Why am I here? Well maybe I thought it's time we stopped fighting. I was never fighting you. Well maybe. But I was. I was fighting you. - I hated you. - [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] I was fighting you without even knowing. I felt I had given you everything and suffered for you. And then you left... Left me for my manager, who was my best friend at the time. I hated you guys so much. My life changed. Why sign the papers after all these years? - Are you tired of torturing us? - [BAYO] He's not done yet. He wants us to go through more loops for his own satisfaction. Look, we won't. The truth of the matter is, after my heart attack, I felt like life is short and life should not be lived with any kind of regrets. Oh, this is useless. He's not signing it. Good night Osage. Hajara, I want you back. Yes. From the very first day I saw you in Abuja. I knew. I knew you were my soulmate. The one for me. Hajara, I broke us because I felt like I couldn't deal with losing you, losing everything. I fought you without even knowing. Hajara, I know also that I cannot probably get you back if I don't grant you the divorce. So, I'm going to let you go. Release you. Hoping that when I do, you'll come back to me. Soulmates can say no. I did. I'll bring the papers tomorrow, Osage. Goodnight. At first I was thrown by this whole girlfriend problem. But you know, I think it will work. Cause I deserve it. I deserve it. I mean, I gave Osage his first and only son. Mm-hmm. I deserve to be celebrated. [LAUGHS] Are you crazy? Do you actually think this is real? Look at this gold digger oh. [IN PIDGIN] Real or fake, that's your business. It's not my business. As long as you pay me and celebrate me, that's all that matters. What's my business with real or fake? [EHI] What is wrong with you? This is not how we behave in this family. If you have to be part of this family, you'd do better. Abule-egba Tiwa Savage. Hmm, that's your business. I will choose how I want to be. I am going to be a member of this family... in short, wait. I am a member of this family. Aunty, You're not a member of this family! You're not and you will never be a member of this family. - Tell that to your father and my son. - Look at this rubbish oh. See, don't be deceived oh. Don't think because I'm a nursing mother. - I will beat you blue-black! - You will... - I will beat you like you stole chicken. - I will bend you. - I will break your head. - You will not try it. I said shut up! Our deal does not in anyway give you the right to threaten my daughter. Guys, baby. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about all of this. Yeah. That's what you always do. [CHAIR CLATTERS] You're always sorry. Imade. Imade! I'm done eating. I'm going. Hmm God. I cannot lie really. I'm surprised.

So why did you break the relationship? - And why are you entering the house now? - And how is that your business? When my nephew will inherit from his father, I want him to inherit in his father's house. I don't understand. What are you talking about? Go. Oi. Hmm. - Come. Come. - [COMIC MUSIC PLAYING] I want a brother to marry you. [SCOFFS] Osage marry me. He's not going to marry me please. But if he does, won't it be nice? Think about it. [ESE] Mm-hmm.

[IMADE] Chalie please can you set up your recording too? - Sure. - [IMADE] Thank you. - Paternity? - Beats me. [IMADE] Uh! Screaming sometimes helps, you know. What? [TIMA] You know, when you're angry, frustrated, sometimes all you need to do is reach within yourself like, from the pit of your gut, just let it all out. Scream. I'll show you. [LAUGHS] Pit of your gut. Just let it go. Like that. [SCREAMS] It works. [LAUGHING] Come on, loosen up. Try it. Look it works. Try it. Pit of your diaphragm, yeah? Just reach within yourself and let everything out. One more time. That's it! That's it. You have it. [LAUGHING] Tell me it worked. I can't believe I actually thought that would work. Come on. [EHI] Daddy can we talk? Sure. Please. What's up? What do you think about my event? I'm sorry baby. I ruined it. I thought I was helping but I wasn't. Even without the breaking news. You know, I actually gave up my Masters program for him. One year in. [CHUCKLES] I was in New York... on scholarship. And then I just get a call, "Oh, Daddy needs you. Daddy needs you" I'm like why, what's going on? Turns out his wife left him and she took his manager with her. And that was how one month turned into ten years of my life. I was not always Osage Wonder. I was not famous for the longest time but all that time I was still a musician. And so are you. - I'm scared. - You should be. Yes After all these years, I'm still scared. - [LAUGHING] Yes. - Ten years. Ten years of cleaning up his mess. Ten years of dealing with the shit he turns peoples lives into. [GIGGLING] Everybody, everybody loves Osage, until they have to live with him! [SCREAMING LOUDLY] That's it. That's it. You have it. Now tell me that worked. Tell me it worked. You're right. I do feel better. But... Looks like I'll have a sore throat. And no matter what happens, I will always love you. You will always be Daddy's little girl. I love you too, Daddy. Yeah.

[SQUAWKS] Why are you so irresponsible? Young lady, what do you have to say for yourself? [SOBBING] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We borrowed money for an investment and it went bad. [ITOHAN] Daddy, I was stuck. I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry. Why didn't you come to me, baby? You know you can always come to me. [ITOHAN] I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - [WONDER] It's okay. [SOBBING] Mommy, I'm sorry. I promise you I'll do better. I'm sorry. Hajara. - It's okay. Calm down please. - [ITOHAN] I'm sorry. [ITOHAN CONTINUES SOBBING] Mommy, I'm sorry. - Mommy, I'm sorry. - [HAJARA] It's okay. [HAJARA] It's okay. Hmm? [HAJARA] Who are those people? - How did they know where to come to? - [IMADE SIGHS] Itohan confessed to me yesterday. Sis... Sis, I need to talk to you. She told me about her plans to kidnap Papa I was able to contact Iya Oloja and she agreed to help. I couldn't go through with it. I couldn't do it. Imade, and you let him show up? I mean, What if somebody had gotten hurt? Come on. But that was the only way I was sure now. At least I got everything under control. Since when did you become so reckless? Who is our father? Why does it always have to end up with me? [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] [OMO] Open the door! I'll handle it. Do we at least know the mother? Well, we're not sure but we think it's her... Her? As in Nanny? The mother owns the breast milk and certainly not Oma. - You mean her? - Yep. Nanny, come here. Come. Um, are you the mother of my baby? How? I am paid to give birth. I'm very fertile. I give birth on behalf of different people. Aunty Oma gave me Boss's sperm to inject Okay. Um... Will you stay with me to take care of this my own? I can do it. Good. Let me take care of my um... Yes please, Papa. Take care of your... Yes. [EVERYONE] Oh, please! [WONDER] Coming over! Oma! What do you want? Take! Take! I have signed. Come and pay me my money. Oma. Pay me my money let me go. You stole my sperm. And you think you can come in here and ask me for money? You will leave here now... Pay me my money. And never come back here! If you pay me my money I won't come back here again. You want to scam a brother. You want to deceive a brother. - [CHARLIE] Oh my goodness! - [IMADE] What is it? I got an email from a friend that works at a streaming platform. What is the difference between me and you? Ehn? What's the difference? No worry. I say no worry. We go discuss, you go punish me my own later but for now, we need to throw away this bad scallywag. I am not going anywhere. - Obonobiekhu! - You have to pay me my money. - Bring your girls! - Pay me my money o. "Heard you were doing a documentary about your father's 60th. I love Osa Wonda. Would love to acquire it. - We're thinking 200 thousand dollars! - [CHARLIE] Two hundred thousand dollars! But there's some flexibility. Let's discuss." [SCREAMING] [OMA] Pay me my money oh. - This way! - Go this way! - [IMADE] It's a lie. - [WONDER] What's going on? [WONDER] What's going on? Let's share it. - [IMADE] Nothing Papa. - [INI] Nothing dad. We'll talk about it tomorrow morning. [GIRLS SQUEAL] Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Wait am not done my interview. Thank you, Charlie. This looks better than the Buzz Cola deal. Listen girls, you guys don't know how it feels to just know that you all have my back. And because you do, it just makes me so happy. You guys are my world.
