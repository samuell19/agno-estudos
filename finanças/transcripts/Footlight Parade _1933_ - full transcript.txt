CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. WHAT A LAUGH. IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING. THEY LAUGHED AT EDISON, TOO. LOOKS LIKE I'M AN ASSISTANT TO A GUY OUT OF A JOB. YOU REMEMBER WHEN MAH-JONGG WAS POPULAR, DON'T YOU, HARRY? SO WHAT? IT'S A FAD. I'VE STAGED 50 MUSICAL COMEDIES, AND I'LL STAGE 50 MORE. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, FRAZER AND GOULD ARE PUTTING NEVER SAY NO INTO REHEARSAL, AND I'M DOING THE NUMBERS. AM I GOING WITH YOU? IF THEY DON'T RUN OUT OF INK. LET'S GO. [FOOTSTEPS] HIYA, KENT. HELLO, BOYS. WHEN DOES NEVER SAY NO GO TO REHEARSAL? CHESTER, IT DON'T. YOU CAN'T GIVE THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY DON'T WANT. WHAT SHOW YOU GONNA DO? NO SHOW, IF WE'RE IN OUR RIGHT MIND. PEOPLE AIN'T PAYING FOR SHOWS NO MORE. TALKING PICTURES-- THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. IT DON'T MEAN A THING, HUH? FLESH IS A DEAD ISSUE. WE'RE IN THE PICTURE BUSINESS. EXHIBITORS. YEAH, WE JUST BOUGHT 4 HOUSES. THEY DELIVER THE SHOW IN TIN CANS, AND WE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. SO MUSICALS ARE OUT, HUH? YEAH, COME ON AROUND THE CORNER, AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY. YEAH, COME ON AROUND THE CORNER. AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY. THERE'S THE ANSWER. IT'S A LOT BETTER TO FILL YOUR THEATER 10 TIMES A DAY AT 40 CENTS A TICKET THAN TO CHARGE $5 BUCKS A SEAT AND HAVE IT HALF-FILLED ONCE A NIGHT. YEAH. IF YOU'RE LUCKY. COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. WON'T LAST. EXCUSE ME, ZEKE. OFFICIAL BUSINESS. FROM NOW ON, HE'LL BE GETTING PLENTY OF ORDERS, BUT THEY WON'T ALL BE BY WIRE. HERE'S YOUR ANSWER. UH-HUH. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, JOHN. [EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING] SO YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE BUSINESS, EH, SI? WHO'S THAT? WHISTLER'S MOTHER? THERE'S COMPETITION. WE'RE BOOKING A HOUSE DOWN THE STREET. SO WE GIVE THEM A LITTLE PROLOGUE TO FIT THE PICTURE. WHAT'S THE PICTURE, UNCLE TOM'S CABIN? WE'RE SHOWING SLAVES OF THE DESERT, SO WE PUT ON SOMETHING ORIENTAL TO FIT THE PLOT. THAT PROLOGUE WOULDN'T FIT ANYTHING BUT AN ASHCAN. JUST THE SAME, IT COSTS MORE THAN THE PICTURE. SAY, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME PUT ON SOME OF THOSE PROLOGUES FOR YOU? NO. NO. NO MORE PROLOGUES. NO MORE PROLOGUES, CHESTER. THAT ORIENTAL FLASH IS TOO EXPENSIVE. AFTER THIS, WE'RE GIVING OUR CUSTOMERS TALKING PICTURES AND NOTHING ELSE. WELL, SO LONG. I GOT TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS TO THE WIFE. BREAD LINE, I HEAR YOU CALLING ME. PUBLIC WANTS TALKING PICTURES, AND TALKING PICTURES ONLY. LISTEN, WHAT YOU'D BETTER DO IS GET YOURSELF ANOTHER JOB. MAYBE I HAVEN'T MADE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD, HONEY. THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY MORE MUSICAL SHOWS. I ALWAYS SAID THEY'D CATCH UP WITH YOU. IS IT MY FAULT IF SOMEBODY INVENTED TALKING PICTURES? I DON'T CARE WHOSE FAULT IT IS. IT'S TIME YOU EARN SOME MONEY. I'M USED TO GOOD CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT. HAVEN'T I ALWAYS GIVEN YOU-- YEAH. WHAT GOES WITH IT. LISTEN, I'M FED UP WITH YOU, AND I HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. WELL... WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT? I'LL SHOW YOU. HERE. SIGN THAT, AND I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO GET A DIVORCE. YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY YOU WANT IT? ABSOLUTELY. MM-HMM. WELL, THAT'S THAT. HERE'S YOUR ASPIRIN--18 CENTS. SAY, HOW DO YOU DO IT? THE PLACE NEXT-DOOR CHARGES A QUARTER. YEAH, BUT HE'S ON HIS OWN. WE GOT 100 STORES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE BUY IN BIG LOTS. WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR ONE STORE, YOU GET SOAKED. WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR 100-- I SEE. PRACTICALLY NAME YOUR OWN PRICE. THAT'S IT. SAY, THAT'S MARVELOUS. THE CHAIN-STORE IDEA SOLVES EVERYTHING. THANKS A MILLION. HEY! YOUR ASPIRIN. TAKE IT YOURSELF. MY HEADACHE'S GONE! COME ON, AL. LISTEN, BOYS. I JUST BOUGHT SOME ASPIRIN. DRUNK AGAIN. NO, NO. LISTEN TO THIS. LISTEN TO THIS. WHEN YOU'VE GOT ONE DRUGSTORE, YOU CHARGE 25 CENTS FOR ASPIRIN. BUT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR 100 STORES, YOU GET IT FOR LESS, SO YOU SELL IT FOR 18 CENTS. SO WHAT? SO YOUR HOUSE-- I MEAN, YOUR STORE IS CROWDED. THAT'S GREAT, CHESTER, OLD BOY. THAT'S A MARVELOUS IDEA. WELL, DON'T YOU GET THE CONNECTION? YEAH, WE'LL USE IT, IF WE EVER OPEN A DRUGSTORE. NO, LISTEN, LISTEN. WHEN YOU PUT ON ONE PROLOGUE, IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. BUT WHEN THE SAME PROLOGUE PLAYS 25, 50, 100 HOUSES, IT DOESN'T COST A CENT MORE. GET IT? WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THERE. YEAH? OH, THE SAME SCENERY, SAME COSTUMES-- PUT THEM ON ONCE, AND THEY STAY PUT ON. WE'VE ONLY GOT 4 THEATERS. PLAY THEM ALL OVER CHICAGO, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. EXHIBITORS EVERYWHERE WILL BE TICKLED PINK TO GET READY-MADE PROLOGUES. HOW DO YOU KNOW? IT'S A CINCH, BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE THEM SWELL PROLOGUES CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN PUT THEM ON THEMSELVES. AND WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE CHAIN-STORE BUSINESS. SI, HE'S RIGHT. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BOYS, YOUR NAME WILL BE UP IN LIGHTS FROM THE ROCK BOTTOM COAST OF MAINE TO THE SUNNY STRANDS OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE. WILL YOU TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE? GOOD MORNING. HOW ABOUT A JOB, MISS PRESCOTT? SEE ARNOLD, THE CASTING DIRECTOR. ANY MAIL? 9 OUT-OF-TOWN CALLS. ONLY 9? WE MUST BE SLIPPING.
