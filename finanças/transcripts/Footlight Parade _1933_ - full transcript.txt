CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. WHAT A LAUGH. IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING. THEY LAUGHED AT EDISON, TOO. LOOKS LIKE I'M AN ASSISTANT TO A GUY OUT OF A JOB. YOU REMEMBER WHEN MAH-JONGG WAS POPULAR, DON'T YOU, HARRY? SO WHAT? IT'S A FAD. I'VE STAGED 50 MUSICAL COMEDIES, AND I'LL STAGE 50 MORE. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, FRAZER AND GOULD ARE PUTTING NEVER SAY NO INTO REHEARSAL, AND I'M DOING THE NUMBERS. AM I GOING WITH YOU? IF THEY DON'T RUN OUT OF INK. LET'S GO. [FOOTSTEPS] HIYA, KENT. HELLO, BOYS. WHEN DOES NEVER SAY NO GO TO REHEARSAL? CHESTER, IT DON'T. YOU CAN'T GIVE THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY DON'T WANT. WHAT SHOW YOU GONNA DO? NO SHOW, IF WE'RE IN OUR RIGHT MIND. PEOPLE AIN'T PAYING FOR SHOWS NO MORE. TALKING PICTURES-- THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. IT DON'T MEAN A THING, HUH? FLESH IS A DEAD ISSUE. WE'RE IN THE PICTURE BUSINESS. EXHIBITORS. YEAH, WE JUST BOUGHT 4 HOUSES. THEY DELIVER THE SHOW IN TIN CANS, AND WE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. SO MUSICALS ARE OUT, HUH? YEAH, COME ON AROUND THE CORNER, AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY. YEAH, COME ON AROUND THE CORNER. AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY. THERE'S THE ANSWER. IT'S A LOT BETTER TO FILL YOUR THEATER 10 TIMES A DAY AT 40 CENTS A TICKET THAN TO CHARGE $5 BUCKS A SEAT AND HAVE IT HALF-FILLED ONCE A NIGHT. YEAH. IF YOU'RE LUCKY. COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. WON'T LAST. EXCUSE ME, ZEKE. OFFICIAL BUSINESS. FROM NOW ON, HE'LL BE GETTING PLENTY OF ORDERS, BUT THEY WON'T ALL BE BY WIRE. HERE'S YOUR ANSWER. UH-HUH. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, JOHN. [EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING] SO YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE BUSINESS, EH, SI? WHO'S THAT? WHISTLER'S MOTHER? THERE'S COMPETITION. WE'RE BOOKING A HOUSE DOWN THE STREET. SO WE GIVE THEM A LITTLE PROLOGUE TO FIT THE PICTURE. WHAT'S THE PICTURE, UNCLE TOM'S CABIN? WE'RE SHOWING SLAVES OF THE DESERT, SO WE PUT ON SOMETHING ORIENTAL TO FIT THE PLOT. THAT PROLOGUE WOULDN'T FIT ANYTHING BUT AN ASHCAN. JUST THE SAME, IT COSTS MORE THAN THE PICTURE. SAY, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME PUT ON SOME OF THOSE PROLOGUES FOR YOU? NO. NO. NO MORE PROLOGUES. NO MORE PROLOGUES, CHESTER. THAT ORIENTAL FLASH IS TOO EXPENSIVE. AFTER THIS, WE'RE GIVING OUR CUSTOMERS TALKING PICTURES AND NOTHING ELSE. WELL, SO LONG. I GOT TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS TO THE WIFE. BREAD LINE, I HEAR YOU CALLING ME. PUBLIC WANTS TALKING PICTURES, AND TALKING PICTURES ONLY. LISTEN, WHAT YOU'D BETTER DO IS GET YOURSELF ANOTHER JOB. MAYBE I HAVEN'T MADE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD, HONEY. THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY MORE MUSICAL SHOWS. I ALWAYS SAID THEY'D CATCH UP WITH YOU. IS IT MY FAULT IF SOMEBODY INVENTED TALKING PICTURES? I DON'T CARE WHOSE FAULT IT IS. IT'S TIME YOU EARN SOME MONEY. I'M USED TO GOOD CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT. HAVEN'T I ALWAYS GIVEN YOU-- YEAH. WHAT GOES WITH IT. LISTEN, I'M FED UP WITH YOU, AND I HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. WELL... WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT? I'LL SHOW YOU. HERE. SIGN THAT, AND I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO GET A DIVORCE. YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY YOU WANT IT? ABSOLUTELY. MM-HMM. WELL, THAT'S THAT. HERE'S YOUR ASPIRIN--18 CENTS. SAY, HOW DO YOU DO IT? THE PLACE NEXT-DOOR CHARGES A QUARTER. YEAH, BUT HE'S ON HIS OWN. WE GOT 100 STORES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE BUY IN BIG LOTS. WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR ONE STORE, YOU GET SOAKED. WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR 100-- I SEE. PRACTICALLY NAME YOUR OWN PRICE. THAT'S IT. SAY, THAT'S MARVELOUS. THE CHAIN-STORE IDEA SOLVES EVERYTHING. THANKS A MILLION. HEY! YOUR ASPIRIN. TAKE IT YOURSELF. MY HEADACHE'S GONE! COME ON, AL. LISTEN, BOYS. I JUST BOUGHT SOME ASPIRIN. DRUNK AGAIN. NO, NO. LISTEN TO THIS. LISTEN TO THIS. WHEN YOU'VE GOT ONE DRUGSTORE, YOU CHARGE 25 CENTS FOR ASPIRIN. BUT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FOR 100 STORES, YOU GET IT FOR LESS, SO YOU SELL IT FOR 18 CENTS. SO WHAT? SO YOUR HOUSE-- I MEAN, YOUR STORE IS CROWDED. THAT'S GREAT, CHESTER, OLD BOY. THAT'S A MARVELOUS IDEA. WELL, DON'T YOU GET THE CONNECTION? YEAH, WE'LL USE IT, IF WE EVER OPEN A DRUGSTORE. NO, LISTEN, LISTEN. WHEN YOU PUT ON ONE PROLOGUE, IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. BUT WHEN THE SAME PROLOGUE PLAYS 25, 50, 100 HOUSES, IT DOESN'T COST A CENT MORE. GET IT? WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THERE. YEAH? OH, THE SAME SCENERY, SAME COSTUMES-- PUT THEM ON ONCE, AND THEY STAY PUT ON. WE'VE ONLY GOT 4 THEATERS. PLAY THEM ALL OVER CHICAGO, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. EXHIBITORS EVERYWHERE WILL BE TICKLED PINK TO GET READY-MADE PROLOGUES. HOW DO YOU KNOW? IT'S A CINCH, BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE THEM SWELL PROLOGUES CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN PUT THEM ON THEMSELVES. AND WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE CHAIN-STORE BUSINESS. SI, HE'S RIGHT. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BOYS, YOUR NAME WILL BE UP IN LIGHTS FROM THE ROCK BOTTOM COAST OF MAINE TO THE SUNNY STRANDS OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE. WILL YOU TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE? GOOD MORNING. HOW ABOUT A JOB, MISS PRESCOTT? SEE ARNOLD, THE CASTING DIRECTOR. ANY MAIL? 9 OUT-OF-TOWN CALLS. ONLY 9? WE MUST BE SLIPPING.

I'M GLAD YOU LIKE THEM, MISS RICH, BUT I WOULDN'T CALL THEM EXACTLY INTELLECTUAL. YOU'RE JUST MODEST. EVERY ONE HAD A DEFINITE CENTRAL THEME-- BRAINS, YOU KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT AT THAT. ANYTHING SPECIAL? OH, I GOT SOME NEW IDEAS ON THAT CAT STUFF. WANTED THE OUTLINE. IT'S ON THE DESK. MOST PROLOGUES, MR. KENT, ARE UTTERLY COMMONPLACE, BUT YOURS... YOURS HAVE MEANING. WHAT WAS IT RUSKIN SAID? "THAT INTANGIBLE SOMETHING." OH, VIVIAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS? IS HE STILL A BOOTLEGGER? NAN IS SO BOURGEOIS AT TIMES. SWELL GAL, THOUGH.

FROM THE BEGINNING, GIRLS. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, DOWN. 1, 2, 3, 4... YOU KNOW YOU'RE LATE, DON'T YOU? â™ª GOOD MORNING, DEAR TEACHER â™ª â™ª GOOD MORNING TO YOU â™ª I'M GOING TO REPORT YOU. MR.

PERHAPS I COULD SPEAK TO MR. KENT. OH, NOW, THAT'S NOT FAIR, MISS THORN. YOU KNOW I'M ALL UPSET. LOOK. MY HAIR'S TURNING GRAY WITH SO MUCH ON MY MIND, AND YOU'RE KEEPING SCOTTY FROM REHEARSALS. BUT HE ISN'T IN YOUR CHORUS ANYMORE. OF COURSE HE ISN'T. THEY MADE HIM A PRINCIPAL LAST NIGHT. A PRINCIPAL! HIM? I TOLD YOU YOUR FAVORITE PEOPLE HAD A VOICE. ALL THESE ANNOYANCES PILING UP. COME ON, SCOTTY. I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO SING THAT NUMBER. AH-CHOO! DON'T GET A COLD, WILL YOU? COME ON! SO LONG, TIME CLOCK. SO LONG, KAHUNA. HERE'S YOUR STATEMENT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. PROFITS GOING UP ALL THE TIME. HERE'S A STATEMENT FOR MR. KENT. NO PROFITS AT ALL. MR. KENT'S STATEMENT SHOWS THAT ALL PROFITS GO BACK INTO PRODUCTION. IS THAT RIGHT? EXACTLY. DRAW $20,000 IN CASH FOR GOULD AND ME. AND CHARGE IT TO PRODUCTION COSTS AS USUAL. AND TAKE A CENTURY NOTE FOR YOURSELF. [KNOCK ON DOOR] GOOD MORNING. IS IT STILL MORNING? OOH, YOU BEAUTIFUL-- [DOOR OPENS] NICE OF YOU TO DROP IN. [DOOR CLOSES] THERE'S SOME MIGHTY PRETTY COUNTRY AROUND HERE. 11 WIRES, 9 PHONE CALLS, AND ONE SECRETARY SLOWLY GOING OUT OF HER MIND! ARRANGE AN AUDITION FOR SOME GIRLS. I WANT ONE TO SING THAT NUMBER WITH SCOTTY. I'M STARTING A NEW DEPARTMENT TODAY--STYLES AND IDEAS. WHO'S GOING TO RUN IT? SHE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE-- HAS BRAINS AND ALL KINDS OF CULTURE-- JUST WHAT WE NEED. GAVE ME A SWELL IDEA-- SLAVES OF OLD AFRICA. A HIT. [TELEPHONE RINGS] SHOULD'VE KICKED HER OUT THE MINUTE I SAW HER. HELLO. FOUR GIRLS FROM THE SWISS NAVY UNIT MARRIED A QUARTET FROM PHILADELPHIA YESTERDAY AND THEY WANT TO QUIT. QUARTET ANY GOOD? IS THE QUARTET ANY GOOD? YEAH. PUT THEM IN THE ACT. PUT THEM IN THE ACT. SORRY, CHESTER, TO KEEP YOU WAITING. HELLO, VIVIAN. THIS IS MISS RICH. MY SECRETARY MISS PRESCOTT. I KNOW MISS BI--RICH, IF YOU REMEMBER. OH, YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. I MET HER AT YOUR PLACE. VIVIAN IS THE HEAD OF OUR NEW STYLE AND IDEA DEPARTMENT. I HOPE YOU'LL BOTH BE VERY HAPPY. OH, NAN.

OUR NEW STYLE AND IDEA DEPARTMENT-- THE HEAD. SPLENDID CHOICE, CHESTER. SPLENDID CHOICE. GET HER AN OFFICE. OK. HERE'S OUR SEMIANNUAL STATEMENT. MAYBE I'D BE BETTER OFF ON A SALARY. I'LL SAY YOU WOULD. WHEN YOU'VE GOT 1/3 INTEREST? DON'T KID YOURSELF. FRAZER AND I AIN'T DRAWING A CENT OUT OF THE BUSINESS, EITHER. IT'S TOUGH ON YOU BOYS. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU GET ALONG. AND BESIDES, GLADSTONE'S COPPED THE MECHANICAL DOLL ANGLE ALREADY. I--I'LL STOP IT SOME WAY, CHESTER. THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG HELP. BETWEEN GLADSTONE STEALING ALL OUR STUFF AND YOU SAYING THERE ARE NO PROFITS, I'M GETTING PRETTY WELL FED UP. BUT, CHESTER, THINK OF THE APOLLO DELUXE THEATERS. SO WHAT? THEY'RE GOING TO DO PROLOGUES--40 HOUSES. HAVE YOU SIGNED THEM? APOLLINARIS SAYS THEY'RE TOO CLASSY FOR OUR REGULAR STUFF. AND GLADSTONE'S HOT AFTER THE CONTRACT. IT'S UP TO YOU, CHESTER, TO THINK UP SOMETHING ORIGINAL. GLADSTONE AGAIN. THAT MEANS THOMPSON. WELL, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. THAT'S THE SPIRIT, CHESTER. I KNEW WE COULD COUNT ON YOU.
