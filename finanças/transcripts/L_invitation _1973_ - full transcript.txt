Hello, is it you, mama I just gave you a call, but you weren't there. It's ten to noon. What did the doctor say? So, it ain't tyfus? You're sure about that? Orange juice. Too many vitamines, perhaps. Is she crying? Is Raphael there? Ask him to get to the phone. Raphael, it's dad. Are you there ... Raphael? I am not angry, you understand ... Mommy is concerned about your little sister. Raphael, listen to me. I told you, I'm not angry anymore. Come on, stop crying. 2310... 15... 703. 467 ... 2666 .... Come on in. Wat's up? The file you asked for. Come on. It's not that bad, give me mommy back. He is very sensitive. Like his mother. I gotta go. Don't worry. I won't be home for lunch. It is friday. We're having fish again. You stupid. I quit. It's noon. I'll call you back at 1.30. Bye. Did you check G12? Yes, mister Lamel. Here it is. One hundred seventy-two thousand six hundred sixty-six. Hello, Collard, Juridical Affairs. Yes, why? I'd rather give him, sergeant. You could better tell it yourself. It's the police. Placet's mother passed away. Mister Placet, there's a call for you. Hello, yes, ... Remy Placet. Could you all come any closer. My friends, the painful task is mine to ... report to you that colleague Placet's mother passed away this morning. My poor friend ... You don't stand alone Placet, we are here too. Come on, come on now ... Shall I get something to drink? - No, no. Get me a pillow ... ... and a trash can. What for? - Under his legs. Some days ago, I received ... Mister Placet's request for a leave. His mother's death affected him very much. I know how much she meant to him. She took fully care of him. Mister Placet's case is exceptional, of course. We talked about it this morning, in the direction committee, and with regards to his situation, and his health, we have sent him on a special leave, for two months. Here Maurice, this is for you. I've got the same. We are all invited at mister Placet's. Mister Collard, we are all invited at mister Placet's. Spread them around, Aline. We are all invited at mister Placet's. In that suburb? - No, no, mister Lamel. He moved places. It's to inaugurate his new place. What is this for? What an affectation. Mister Remy Placet-Blanchard is pleased to invite you to a small reception. Saturday the 16th, as of 3 p.m. at his new place: 'De Clematis', chemin des Coudres. Apparently, he is doing very well. I don't have one for you. Aren't you invited? Yes, of course I am. He's doing well, our orphan. - Without that mother of his. Who knows what he got paid for that old dump. When he brought us chocolates last month, he promised us a surprise. He didn't invite the spouses. We'll find you one. Here it is. Look, "De Clematis". Should I pick you up later? - I'll drive back home with someone. Is there enough for us to drink, sir? More than enough, sir. You should call me Emile. Especially regarding the guests. A matter of style, sir. - They are colleagues from the office. Even more reason. There they are. - I'll go, sir. Miss ... Sir, is this mister Placet's place? Yes, miss. Who should I announce? - Aline Thevoz. Did you come alone, miss Aline? - My brother took me here. And the others? - I don't know. They'll be coming. It's very neat out here. You got a butler, like in a movie. It's only for today. I told you before, without your mother, you would live a wonderful life. You were right, mister Placet? Having a house like this, you'll make a good impression on others. Is this all yours? There will be nobody there yet. I told you we are early. Leave that bottle. It isn't a picnic. - You'll never know, tally. Maurice, please call me Hel?ne. - Yes, my tally. You'd better had it wrapped up. Placet isn't the Royal Palace of England. Well, he isn't doing bad, my colleague. 'De Clematis'. Maurice, stop it now. Wait. Somebody is coming. - Damn, we are at the wrong place. Hello, you're here already! How lovely! We're coming down. She has seen the house before. So, it is all yours. I sold my place in the city and this is what they came up with. It's a dream house. Thumbs up. Excuse me sir, I thought you were dead. Doesn't matter. It's ok. It's your mother? Lamel said she was a nag. Not my words. Just quoting. My mother was quit original, an artist ... Is it you who ... ? - No, my mother. I keep it, as a souvenir. - It ain't easy, is it? Ahh, don't touch it, my baby. Tell me how often you have sinned last week? Come closer, baby, I can't hear you. How often? It's large. Yes. They are not just some snacks on paper plates ... Tell me how it is to be a millionaire? For me, an orange juice, lots of rum, and a dash of Marie Brizard. We don't have Marie Brizard, sir. - Some more rum, then. Some alcohol, tally? No, thanks. - Come on ... Stop it, Maurice. Here we are. - How beautiful. You didn't expect this, right? Hello, mister Mermet. Darn big. You haven't seen the buffet yet. There's space here for having kids. - What a large estate. Not now, I need to see my guests. Please allow me, sir. A third one? - Yes, a good third. You should try it with a little Angoustura... and a pinch of cinnamon. What a nice surprise, mister Placet. Well, you got your estate over here. Yes, it's quit large. Is it all yours? A paradise for sure ... with all those beautiful trees. Do you want to fresh up, miss Debonveau? - I am doing well. The countryside is beautiful this time of the year, with these trees. Oh, pardon! Hello, mister Collard. - Oh, it's you, Lamel. We were thinking along the same lines. Like in the army, in rows of two. What's the price for such an estate? I don't know. I got it in exchange for my other house, and a little extra on top of that. You know, I didn't want to invite the family ... because of miss Debonveau and mister Lamel. They would be lonesome. - Yes, I understand. It's that stick causing the noise. Be careful, Charles. Don't touch it, it'll break. That relais is a smart system. There's the chief of staff. Stop it, Rene. Do you know, my dear Placet, when you left, we were concerned. But I am pleased to see how you got over your sadness. Hello, sir director, hello, sir assistant director. Oh, pardon. Hello, miss secretary, hello, mister office manager. Hello, mister assistant office manager. - You didn't lose your good temper. You've done very well. Sadly, I am alone now. - You should be getting married, Remy. Lovely, this large room, Placet, the folding doors to the terrace. ... all the flowers on the walls. How much would this cost? - A lot. Don't touch it, it'll break, Like I said before. You want to try? Funny color. What is it? A Caribbean typhoon, my speciality. Try it, it destroys everything on its path. No, thanks. I prefer a beer with this heat. You should try it. Orange juice, rum, Angoustura, a pinch of cinnamon, and ... wham! My father was a professor of botanics. It's a friend of my mother, my stepfather. Simone, don't you like some rum? Some rum? Miss, not too much, hey. Hey Mermet, are you going to give a speech? You could speech yourself. - Why? Because you want him to do it. No, I rather don't. Mister Collard should do it. Bosses first. I am not your boss today. I am a guest, like you. Though, I'd like to say that I am very glad to see our colleague back again in excellent condition and I want to thank him for his generous hospitality. Cheers to his wellbeing. To your health, Remy, and to your estate. How stupid. A cloth please? Allow me, miss. Here, squanderer. I want to thank you, mister Collard. Also, I want to say how much I appreciate having the entire office here at my place. Ever since my mothers death, and my long absence, I realized how important you all are in my life. For twenty years now, I participated in this little collective ... and you, one could say, became like a second family to me. Now, after coming over my troubles, I am glad ... to find myself back in your midst again, in a sphere of friendship, mutual understanding, and why not, joviality. Thanks again. Well said, Remy. Emotions make me thirsty. General! The troops are thirsty! But they won't surrender. What if we go out, and seek for some coolness under the trees? Excellent idea. Don't you think so, dear Placet? - Yes, of course. Could you serve us at the terrace , sir? Emile, please. In between flowers, leaves, and bushes my heart beats for you alone. What a jerk, what a fool. I didn't know he had so much money. This big house, just for himself. He'll be married someday. Look, miss Emma. You love traveling. All the shadows of the Orient in one glass, an evening at home, no television, relaxed in your armchair, the south seas at your fingertips. Look, look! Tahiti, pink beaches and lagoons. Do you see the palm trees? Over there! Don't you see a thing? Drink this, then you'll see them. It's spicy and sweet at the same time. There's no alcohol in it, it's neutralized by the spices. Pineapple juice, rum, and spices. It's the favorite drink of the coral fishermen of the Fiji islands. They call it 'Papaouate tamoure'. Very energizing if the weather is hot. Can I get the recipe? The secret is in the dosage. It's too hot for you, miss Emma. To make childbirth easier, the Corsicans use a mixture of birch bark, lichen, and pine cone, soaked in alcohol over a period of time. It relaxes the muscles. and causes a longterm euphoria. Maurice, can I speak to you for a second? - What's up, tally? Come here. You are overacting Maurice. You are ridiculizing mister Collard What have I done? - What a nerd! It's nothing? Laughing is allowed. We are not at the office here. You don't know how to behave yourself in public. You never stop drinking and you're flirting with Aline. With Aline! Don't get angry, tally. - Bastard! That's over now. May I use the phone for a minute? - Yes, of course. The phone, please. Down at the stairs, sir. The rambler rose, and the rambling geranium, for example ... only grow when they are being led. If they are tightened to something with a piece of rope, or braided around a trellis. The Morning Glory instead, has stalks attaching themselves. The Pomea Purpurea and the Ampelopsis use a different method. They got suctorial disks. The Ampelopsis Quinquae Folia... doesn't differ from the wild vineyard. And you drive past the village. There's a vineyard on your right hand ... we had a picnic there two years ago, a corn field on your left hand, and ... at the end of the field, is a sign saying: 'dumping prohibited'. And right behind it, there's a road, remember? Then, walk down that road, cross a little bridge, you remember? Then you'll see a white wooden gate. Don't you think he changed a lot? He's different at the office. He is so funny with his flowers. He has a sense of class. Why did he live like a vagabond for twenty years, only to please his mother. Look, there is Maurice. - Are you engaged to someone? Are you crazy, I got three brothers. Thank you, sir. Our comedian is letting go. He always needs to play crazy man. Come on, mister Lamel, we are free. Let's go dance, here's space. Come on, Hel?ne. Come dance, Remy. Come, miss Char. Yes, I'm coming. Remy, come over here. I'll show you how to dance. Come dance, miss Char. I'll bring you some drinks. Don't you wanna dance? Take a glass. You won't get stains from white wine. I got hay fever. They are playing music now. It's Dutoit who is playing the clown. Come on, mister Placet, show us how to dance. I don't know how to. Come. I'll show it. Please relax. one, two, three, four ... What are you waiting for? Hey Mermet, what did you break this time? Come on and join us. The hips, swing those hips! Make room for the youngsters! There are many, no? There are less than it seems like, like we say. Like a young lady, miss Emma. Do you feel how sticky they are? It's the acid. Alexander, don't play over there. Leave it. Get down ... down. The boss is nagging about them, but, I can't tie them up. That's ideal for children. Are you the gardener? Yes, and it comes in handy with those kids. Don't walk on the seeds. There isn't much to do in the winter. Like to smoke? Go play over there. I won't tell you twice. What's happening to me? Don't you feel well, miss Emma? It must be the heat. She wanted to dance, and now this. Take care Aline, you're sweating. And miss Emma disappeared? You know how to adjust. Why don't you do the same, mister Collard? You are right, Maurice. Why not. We are out. I believe miss Emma doesn't feel well. She locked herself up in the bathroom. She's probably sick. No surprise. She looked like a merry go round. Miss Debonveau is ill. She locked herself up in the bathroom. I go take a look. - You stay, Remy. The ladies will go. Go take a look, Hel?ne. It's my fault. I should have known better. It's the heat. It isn't your fault, mister Lamel, it's the heat. Miss Emma, can you hear me? She must have fainted out ... Miss Emma. Miss Char here. Aren't you well? This won't work. She fainted out. I don't see anything, the key is in there. You want to say hi too? This is the second youngest. Alexander, Nicolas... Come say hello. What should we do now? - We'll have to wait. Should we break open the door? - Breaking open the door? Miss Emma got sick, she is in the bathroom. We need to get mister Collard over here. If you hear me, knock twice. You have to understand, marriage doesn't scare me off, she has qualities and class, but at my age, one appreciates variation. Understand, mister Collard. I can't help it. That's how I am. I can't stay unaffected, that's how it goes. I understand ... I understand. I have had that too. Since my kids finished their studies, and my wive is often visiting her parents in England, so, I organized my peaceful life. I don't want to cause any turmoil. I got a girlfriend, for ten years now, she knows me very well, totally my piece of cake. Every wednesday, when I'm at hers ... Mozart's 5th concerto is playing and the gin-fizz is on the table. Wait, we'll assist you. Miss Debonveau fainted out. We'll go through the window. We'll see each other, with your family. Come over when the weather will be nice. I won't forget. Thanks again. I go tell my wive right away. Nicholas, if you go on like that, then ... Take it easy, miss Debonveau, we are coming. She doesn't hear us. - Go ahead, I secure the ladder. And? Do you see something? - Nobody there. There's no one? Where are the others? - Aren't they outside? But, you are here! You gained back some color, miss Debonveau. Thanks to those exotic drinks. It are the General's Molotov cocktails. Never accept mixed drinks. - Come and sit down in the shadow. Are you there, mama? Good. Things go really well, you know ... no, Placet There is even champaign. Well, like I said, they got six: Three boys and three girls. You just exaggerated a little. I know, but sometimes I can't stand your jokes. It was just for fun - You don't know how to behave. Come on, relax a little bit. Let yourself go a little more, tally. Do you love me? Yes or no? It has nothing to do with it. I will love you even more when you learn how to behave. I will, I will. It's a very good one. For this occasion only, I am so happy you are all here. Come have a drink General. - Of course, Emile, take a drink. Never when I'm serving, sir. - An exception General, what's up? What if I offer you one? - In that case ... What did you just say? "Fortunate is he, who gets a glass from a fierce maned virgin". Oh, that sounds wonderful. It is an Algonkin proverb. - Where did you get it from? I love traveling, sir. What's actually your name, General? Sir may call me Emile. An interesting character. He doesn't look like a butler. I don't like his smile. I would like to advice some champaign to madame. No, thanks. - It won't harm you. It's a light one. This champaign enhances digestion. - Really? It is a princely remedy, in use at all courts. Is that true? It's good. Yes, Brahms is good, but ... And Mozart ... do you like it I love anything classic. Like the hussars Emilio, Lamelo, Collardi, boem, beh, boem, this isn't me. Or, in French: Emile, don't let them sit on you. The fierce eyed virgins are thirsty. Let me drink from your glass. I raise my glass to our brave army, guarding our peace, and defending our homes. The fortune of our wives, and our white tops. Without our army, you won't be here. Yes, corporal. Are you still a member of the good old grenadiers? Pang, pang, every sunday. Maurice, you are over-acting. I have been mobilized for 800 days, when mister Dutoit was peeing his pants still, that is. No, no, I've had enough, really. You don't let me drink alone, do you? No, really. I am not used to it. Come on, do it for me. I serve madame. She drinks whenever she wants. I am the vampire of Saint-Gervais. Stop it, before we fall down. You are terrible, really. Like this. No, not over here. What's wrong? - I was bitten. Stay there. Don't move, it's a bee. Leave me. I'm getting out the poison. I got his sting already. No Maurice, not over here. Hello. Have you seen my friends? No, not over here. Alright. Wait, we are being observed. Over there, in the bushes. No one. Strange, I really thought ... I am sure. They're all at the house. It is beautiful, but far away from the office. How do you do that? Is there a bus going? - I will get my drivers license. I ordered a little automobile. And, how are you gonna take care of the garden? It's large. I got a gardener twice a week. I am taking care of the flowers myself. If I were you, I'd stay home. You don't need to work anymore. You know, if I would stay here on my own ... I would get bored. You are very hot, Want to drink anything? - No, I have had too much. She was bitten by a tarantula. Come on, run! You won't get me! Come on, Aline. They've been searching us, there's the boss coming. Oh la la, look who's here ... our doubting duo ... Mister Lamel, a song please! What about you, mister Emile? General, a song from the islands. Excuse me, sir, I can't sing. Just act like you can sing, like the singers on TV. Please stay here, sir Emile. Mister Emile, stay here mister Emile! Listen, shall we play a little game? Good idea. 'To the golden ring', miss Emma? 'To the golden ring', miss Emma. I embrace you in the bushes? Do you know 'Guess my profession'? Have a croquet, mister Placet? No, but I got a game of cards. Everybody knows 'Guess my profession', no? - No ball game, Remy? -No. My game is really funny. Alright, let's play that, it's you who proposed it. Yes, miss ... Stunt man! Ladies and gentlemen, silence please. The show goes on ... A communication manager. Gardener. - A road sweeper. Scissors-grinder. A sailor on a stomping boat. That's a good one. Cheese maker. Feeder of peacocks. A captain of a gondola. - Right, mister Lamel. You got to reward mister Lamel. You think so? - It's part of the game. And, mister Lamel, what do you want? A kiss, he? We will close our eyes. That's what you have been wanting for so long. Isn't it true, miss Emma? You'll get her with a tender kiss. That's unfair. What a sneak. Your turn, mister Lamel. It's your turn now. Steno ... - No, a typist. A stenotypist! A piano player. - Yes. A reward! Salary increase. - Mister Collard is to decide. Just one penny. Yes. - Alright. It's goose liver. What? It isn't staining? No, it doesn't stain. A masseur. - Woodchopper. A surgeon. - Butcher. What was he cutting? Pepperoni. - There's machines for that nowadays. And, your reward, Maurice? 100 francs would be nice. Yes, 100 francs. 100 francs and nothing else. He can afford it. Scandalous, playing for money. Now you see, one only needs to ask for it. That's overdone. Give him back the money. - Why, my tally? I won it. That's the game. Do you want it back, Remy? - Once given, stays given. Now, it's my turn. Police is arriving. They are here looking for Mermet. Perhaps your car is parked wrongly? We are looking for a burglar. Have you seen him? Excuses for the interruption. You could be of help to us. I am inspector Widmer and this is sergeant Munier. Perhaps one of you saw this man. Here's a picture. - What has he done? I've seen him. - Oh yes, where? When I arrived here. Behind a hedge, shortly after noon. Are you sure? - Very sure, he was sleeping on the grass. I woke him up, and he ran away. - What time was that? 2.35 pm. I checked my watch when it happened. Anyone else saw him? Look closely. Is he dangerous? It depends. - What do you mean? He is unarmed, but lock your doors when you leave. Do you need any help? No, but if you see him, please call 21.03.33. Thank you. Sorry for interrupting your party. I go check if I locked my car. Do you like a drink? - No, thanks Let's not be distracted. A drink, chef? No, thanks, Dutoit. That little one doesn't look like a cop, more like a journalist. He looks like a dentist. Miss Char. - Yes, please. If I would live here alone, I would be scared with all those seasonal workers around. O, miss Char. A good looking, spaghetti-eater with dark eyes, will suit you, no? Maurice, you're going too far now. Do you have a dog, mister Placet? No, not yet. Nowadays it's better to secure your stuff at a bank. Do you have a robbery insurance? - Sure I do. Also for glass damage? Yes, of course. I believe I'll take a look at my car. - What a hustle for just a pilfer. Did you ever stole cherries, Remy? Drink some more, that always helps. Are you coming with me for a moment? You got your eyes on something ... yes. You are really warm. Yes, I am. Me too, because of you. It's funny, Simone, today, I see you with a different eye. No, not over here. Where else? Can you imagine? A fight. Reds against the whites. And, you don't feel anything? Feel the groaning? The typhoon from the Caribbean? Wait, I was gone for a second, I don't hear it. No, nothing. Are you deaf, it's impossible. What about you, Aline? You don't hear it either? The 'papaouate tamoure'. The fury of the tropics. Oh yes, it's marvellous. Nice fight, he? It is making me thirsty. I saw a bird, red and blue. A finch, probably. I'll look for it and show him. He's mostly high up. - I call him. Whats up, sergeant. Are you playing catch-and-release the thief? Maurice! -Yes. Play the music really loud, please. Are we continuing our game? The... show is going on ... A dancer. A stripper! Amusement ... at the office, when it's hot. What should I do? Take my shoes off. That is not funny. I unbutton my dress ... and look outside ... I try to forget the tapping of the typewriters, and you ... you ... you are waiting. Look now! Stop it. It's enough now! What's wrong? You've gone crazy? Impossible. - Don't stand like that, dress up! Understood? I've never seen this before. Please wait for two minutes, mama. It's your fault she's drunk. You acted like a fool. We are not at the office. Office or not, not all is to be tolerated. I am glad she isn't my daughter. I am very sorry. Why did you do it? I don't know. I guess I wanted to provoke Lamel. Don't talk to me like that. I'm not a child anymore. That bastard doesn't need to educate me. Calm down, it's not your fault. - Let him stop then. You gotta stop too, mister Lamel. Those stupid jokes are his idea. The 100 francs. Why did you react to that, mister Placet? To humiliate us? You don't play for money. Well, if it makes him happy, what does 100 francs mean, then? What if I would ask for a 1000 francs? He is right. You are not ought to do those things. I didn't want to do anything wrong. I know, but it's wrong anyway. I beg you, my dearest, stop drinking. Leave me alone! A refreshing drink, sir? You don't think it's enough? - There's always room for more. All that stuff you offered us. What do you want, actually? You are insinuating things I never meant. What about this? It's my profession, sir. - It could be done in many ways. I follow mister Placet's will. Did he order this crap? What crap, sir? - What's in there? You don't have to drink it. Give it to me. Enough damage has been done. He is totally crazy. Wait. What's going on Lamel. Hold yourself. It's you who lost all control. It's complete anarchy over here! One keeps on drinking, undresses, cracking down on the army ... throwing money out of the window. You think that's normal? I worked at the office for 40 years. Worked hard for every single penny. Nobody will humiliate me. - Come on, mister Lamel. One month's salary wasted in two hours. A shame! You are offending us with all your money. - Joy is not a crime. You call that joy? Getting an old lady drunk? Stimulating a young lady to pornography, that's enjoyment? Of course you are right, mister Lamel. - Would you accept this from your daughter? Let me tell you something, it's because of this. Maurice, mind your own business. Let me go. I told you, let me go. Asshole! I'll show you something, idiot! You'll get that back, dickhead. Wake up, Remy! That came in handy. Very handy! Emile, get some water. - He shouldn't stay in the sun. Let's bring him inside. Help me, Dutoit. Be careful, he. Are you still there, mama? What happened? - He got punched. Put a pillow under his knees. It's all your fault. - No it's not your fault. Go outside for a minute. It'll be good for you. A damp cloth, please. I got smelling salts. Such a wonderful day. Are you alright Remy? - Leave me. What do you mean? Just go. You want us to leave? Go away. Leave me alone. You want us to leave, Remy? Yes, I am done for. I can't take it any longer. Mister Collard. He wants us to leave. Leave me! You want us to go to the garden? Shall we leave you alone for a minute? Leave. It's all my fault. - That's not true, mister Placet. Yes, it is, it's my fault. Leave me! Leave me alone! Please, go away. It seems better indeed, if you leave him alone. He's in shock. I'll take care of him. We got to clean up first. - No way, madame. In that case, if he really wants to be alone ... Don't worry, dear Placet, really. It was delicious. Really delicious. Goodbye, mister Placet. It was truly fantastic. You don't blame it on me, Remy? Where shall I put it? - You won it, Maurice. Thanks for everything. It was very nice, thank you. A nice mess you made of it. We're being kicked out like beggars. Despite everything, we had a wonderful day, Remy. Magnificent. You'll see. In an hour from now, you'll feel much better. See you soon. Maybe next week on sunday. Take some cakes for the kids. Thanks. I left her here. I am no fool, understand. We were dancing. You remember? Emile, did you take my jacket? It got to be somewhere, god damn! It doesn't disappear automatically. Impossible, damn it. I can throw away my tie then, and the handkerchief fitted well with it. Aline, we are leaving. Do you want to say goodbye to mister Placet? - Yes. Mermet, did you take my jacket? You always get your hands on everything. Goodbye, mister Placet. I am really sorry. No need to, it's the heat and the wine.. I did not had to ... Goodbye and thanks a lot. Do you like a cup of coffee at my place? - No, thanks. You didn't bring your automobile? Hypocrite! What? - Hypocrite! You are crazy! - Bastard. What's wrong with you? You lost your mind? Didn't you cause enough trouble today? Are you going to scold me? Tell me, professor... What does miss Char's knee feel like? - Shut up. We'll have a talk on monday, miss Thevoz. With whom? - Don't answer, she is drunk. No, Simone, not at all. Stupid kid. - Yes, but I am not married. You want a ride? - No, thanks, Maurice, I'd rather walk. You want a ride, Aline? No, thanks. I'll take a bus to the village, or walk. Don't be provoked. I'm not. It's more about mister Placet. Look, they got him. Damn, my jacket. Thief! - What's up? This is my jacket. Look, my handkerchief, my tie. - Did you steal his jacket? I didn't know it was his. It's torn. Yes, he resisted firmly, we just nearly stopped him. My jacket is ruined. - It's only the seam, sir. Why, only the seam. I can't wear it no more. Better caution would have been nice, no! Look, damaged completely. 250 francs. Bastard! - Yes, it's funny This is funny. I am laughing my ass off. Mister Emile. I want to ask you something. Do you like to stay here, forever? Here. With you, sir? Are you serious, sir? I need someone to take care of my house. I don't want to hurt your feelings, sir, ... but I don't want to pin myself to anything. I am a globetrotter. I love variation. I am sorry. I am very touched by your proposal. Mireille.
