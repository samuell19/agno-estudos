Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you planned. Only remember me. You understand it will be late to counsel then or pray, Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve, For if the darkness and corruption leave a vestige Of the thoughts that I once had, Better by far you should forget - [Reverend] and smile... - [James] Mummy. [Reverend] then that you should remember and be sad. Mummy! (Panting) Mummy. (Tense music) (Grunts) Oh! (Grunting) [Nurse Mary] Put the knife down, please, James. Put the knife down!
