CJ Entertainment presents A SOO Film production Executive producer Katharine Kim Produced by MIN Jin-soo MIN Kyu-dong LIM Soo-Jung GONG Yoo FINDING MR. DESTINY Directed by CHANG You-jeong Attention, please! First act starts on the lift, so mark your places. We don't need any accidents. Cherry will start at center stage... And where is she? She's not actually here, is she? She's trying to park outside. It's a big van, you know. And you believe her? Cherry just got here. She's changing in the van. It's safe to start now, Ji-woo. Let's pick up from before the prelude. Let's take a break. We don't want to seem so eager, do we? Ten minute break. Ten minutes, people. Ji-woo? Yes? I need some caffeine. A latte. You remember? Double shot with a hint of caramel. Extremely hot. Extremely hot... One freaking hot latte, please. Those work clothes really suit you. Huh? What are you doing here? Sorry to bother you at work. Excuse me. Go ahead. Yes, Woo-hyung? I'll be there soon. Damn it! I'll be there in a minute! Sorry for that. We're so busy during prep. I wanted to give it to you before I left. Ji-woo. - Would you... - It's not right for me. You could give it a try. Like I said before, I'm not ready. I'm sorry. I should go. Ji-woo. Yes? Here. Light check! How about backpacking through Europe? - Beautiful weather this time of year. - No, no! Wait, sir! South America is safer than ever! Now is the best time to go. I guarantee it! Kidnap, assault, burglary, and drugs. Not to mention all the bombings. Have you heard of tsunamis, sir? They can move from Hawaii to Asia in less than 21 hours. Tsunamis are terrorizing the entire world... What are you, Interpol? Why do you collect all this? Only to ensure the safety of our clients. That's what I mean! Why are you worrying about it? Let the mayors take care of local safety! It's simple! For France, the Eiffel Tower! Brazil is about samba! Okay? But they have the right to know. You heard about the downsizing? One false move, and we're all gone! Get back to work! France, Eiffel Tower. Brazil, samba! How hard is that? Indonesia! Tsunami? No! Bali! Bali, the honeymoon paradise! Go pack your bags! We're here, ladies! Isn't it beautiful? That way, ma'am. The main office sent you, eh? You'll knock them dead! We got pictures, everyone! Excuse me, sir? That was past tense in Japanese. The correct expression is "Would you like to", or "We will take pictures". Shall we take pictures? Okay. Pictures, everyone! Kimchi! Here we go. That's great! One more! Okay! Hey, you! Where are you going? Huh? I'm sorry! Hey, wait! Does one look bigger? That's too much padding. - You're a teacher, for god's sakes. - I meant my eyeliner. Are they that big? Dr. JUNG better be proposing tonight. Ji-woo. Don't I look hot? You'll get foot cramps. You know what? One of my students. His mom is your age! What?! - Old maid! - You little... Your troops need to be organized and strategic! In these times of cutting edge. Over and out! Stop right there! - I said, stop! - Halt! - Yes, sir! - Evening, sir! Why are you home? - Aren't you meeting the pilot? - He flew to New York. You're already on top of his schedule? Impressive. What an assertive fellow! So did he mention a date? - I just met him, Dad. - It's already been a month. Your zodiac signs are a perfect fit. He probably saw her looking like that. How many times did I tell you? Clean yourself up when you're going out. Or better yet... Take Ji-hye's clothes with you. He said I looked good in my work clothes! Like Audrey Hepburn. Yeah. Sure. Not exactly an honest fellow, is he? Take your jacket with you. What's this? Oh my god! - Dad, wait! - You did it! No, Dad! That's not it! Dad! You've got it all wrong! Hey, give that back! Thank you, Ji-woo! I'm so proud of you! - It's a diamond ring! - Is it? Goddamn it. See you later, honey! Gi-joon will pick up Woo-ri later! Great day to be in love, isn't it? Don't you think so, Woo-ri? What's with the faces? Going somewhere? My next book is set in the Himalayas. I'm going out to do some real, hands-on research. Where to? The hills in the backyard. It'll get published this time, right? Yeah, sure! Soon. The school bus will be here soon. Here's her backpack. - See you later, Princess! - You'll be late, Dad. And stop hitting the other kids. You're not going to work today, Uncle Gi-joon? ? It's dark and cold, ? ? like the winter nights. ? ? How did I get here again? ? ? I was once in love... ? Cherry... Let's bring you down. Come down. This is so annoying. I hate musicals... This doesn't feel sturdy to me. What are you doing? Aerobics? We might as well play your cartoon theme song. You were quite good at it. That was ages ago, Soo-kyung. Ji-woo. - What theme song? - Never mind. - Ji-woo. - What? Seeing anyone these days? Congratulations. Pilot CHOI Tae-young. What am I supposed to tell him? Great day to be in love, eh? You idiot! Don't use violence! - Violence is wrong! - You deserve it! You're so dead! - Come back here! - Come on! - Stop right there! - Calm down, honey! What are you going to do now? Start a business! What? I'm gonna start a business. One that doesn't take advantage of people. With innovative vision and customer satisfaction. That's what a business should be! Jesus Christ. What is this, a public service announcement? What is wrong with you?! What did I do to deserve such a brother? Let's go to school, Woo-ri. Don't you end up like him. I didn't mean to tell on you... - I love the business plan. - Get out here! Yes, ma'am! I'm in a meeting right now. I'll give you a call later. Bye. See? Everyone wants to be a venture capitalist. But it's not for just anyone. Only people like you can handle it. You always stood out, even back in college. Really? - How? - Huh? You look trustworthy and responsible. You're the perfect type to do business. - I am? - Yup. I was the consultant for this store, too. - Really? - Sure. Could I take some pictures? It's for my research. Still meticulous as ever. Go ahead. I'll be right back. Great design work. Excuse me. - You know an AHN Hyo-Jung? - Yes. Geography major, class of 2002? Did AHN Hyo-Jung contact you about venture capital consulting? Yes. - There she is! - Let's go! - You look so... - I know. - Trustworthy and... - Gullible. Easy to con. You're lucky we got there in time. Or you would've been robbed clean. - She scams everyone with... - AHN Hyo-Jung! - Where is she? - Hyo-Jung! - Let's go inside! - Hyo-Jung! Hey, excuse me! Keep it down! Quiet, sir! Be quiet! Old loves... Giving me a migraine. Hold on. Old love? This isn't about old loves! It's about first loves, sir! First love. - First love! - Fine. Whatever. Gi-joon? Is that you? Hey! It's me, YOON Jae-ha! - Gi-joon! - Long time no see... Still looking nice and slick. - How are you? - Weren't you our TA? - Yes, it's nice to see you. - How have you been, sir? Look, Gi-joon! He was the professor's assistant! Good to see you, sir! It's almost an alumni meeting, thanks to Hyo-Jung! Hyo-Jung, that bitch! My goddamn security deposit! I'm sure she had a good reason. My Hyo-Jung isn't that kind of girl. She's not "your" Hyo-Jung! - She and I dated. - What? Let's get one thing straight, boys. I was Hyo-jung's first love. Why would she have settled for you? - She was my sweetie pie. - Shut up! We even went to the water park together! What's so important about it? First love don't really matter these days. Why not? How can your first love not matter? - You're so cold-hearted! - Where has the romance gone? First love is important! Right? - Don't you agree? - Quiet down people! Quiet! Have a seat! All these people are dragged here by their first loves. First loves are a real problem. If only I could see her again, just once... What good will that do? Wash yourself up, will you? I want to find her at any cost! I think about her every day! Don't you? Finding your first love? I'll go to the airport. We need to talk. All right. Sir! Help me get this off! Hi, Jong-wook. Search result for KIM Jong-wook To "The Last Show"! Cheers! Hey! KIM Jong-wook! - KIM Jong-wook? - You bastard! What's wrong with you? Are you all right? Do I look all right? - Hi, Ji-woo! - Hi. Sorry I'm late. You! I heard you broke up with the pilot! Because you're still not over your first love? - The thing is, Dad... - I've had it! - Stop right there! - Hear me out, Dad! - Get back here! - Dad! Ji-woo! Stop right there! I said, stop! "First Love Agency" I'll move out after three successful cases. Or two. Is this the "First Love Agency"? Come on in, sir! We'll help you find your first love. After you find her, do I get to sleep with her? What? Why would I look for my first love? - Huh? - Come back later, sir. If I ever find her, I'll kill her! That's very touching, ma'am. Finding your husband's first love for him. He mentioned her a few times. Sharing fond memories brings us closer together. Did he mention her name? That bitch's name? I mean... That woman's name is... RYU Young-sook. And who should I contact once I find her? Just kill her on the spot, please. Just thinking about those bitches and how they ran away... Keep it down, would you?! I'm here. You satisfied? - So don't come to the show. - Halt! You ruined the last chance at marriage for some old love! So you brought me here? What is this place? - Some detective agency? - We're not! A detective agency. We're a legal corporation with all the licenses. It's a niche market, not something illegal. I was just saying... So, can you find him? - He's never failed. - I wouldn't say never... But it's close enough. As long as your information is accurate. And the more, the better. Enough accurate information and you'll find him? Of course. Great. - Can we get started soon? - That's my brother-in-law's... My assistant's desk. He's like a brother to me. PARK. My assistant. He's running late today. Tell me anything you can remember. Where he grew up... I don't know. - What school he went to? - Don't know. - How old he is? - Don't know. Well, you had to have met him somewhere? In an Indian town. They're called Native Americans. Oh! You meant, in India. And his name? KIM Zoh... KIM Jowoo... How many blind dates should I send you on? Let's fix you up with the whole military, eh? - Tomorrow work for you? - KIM! KIM. Jong. Wook. December 31st 1999. On the plane to India in 1999. SEO Ji-woo got airsick. Are you all right? Try this? I only have one. Sharp, chiseled looks. A deep, romantic voice. Everybody fell asleep. But not Ji-woo. We're in India now. Couldn't he just say, "we're here"? So you traveled with him? No. If it's meant to be, then we'll meet again. Seven and a half hour flight from Seoul to Delhi. Stopped at Osaka to make a transfer. Where are you going? - The post office. - This way! This way! No, it's this way! Wow. This, right here. This is a work of art! - What country is this? - India! India? What's India famous for? Curry, of course! They even named a place after it. Right here. Kerala. If you say it really fast, it's curry! He actually got seasick while riding a camel! Even the motion sickness patch isn't helping! Give me a room. They're all full. From the plane? Error: Unauthorized access It's still not working? Why don't you tell them you're from a travel agency? That's fraud. But you used to work there. If you weren't fired, you could've made manager! Just go with it! It's all about confidence! Be brave! Like this! I'm the manager of Didi Tour Agency! Manager HAN! After all these years of doing business here! We should've gotten this information right away! Must I come here myself? - Your coffee... - Oh, thank you... What exactly are you looking for? What destination? In 1999. India. Have a nice day, sir! It's here! He's in here! Yes! Hey! You can't even keep the set in order. You idiot. And you call yourself stage director? I'm sorry, sir. Anyone thinks they can direct these days. That goddamn asshole. Shit! Your cell phone was off. But how could you come here? - Your house, then? - Of course not! That's not what I meant. I'm sorry, but... I can't do this. I'm sorry. What are you saying? I'm sure you know, but I only went to get my dad off my back. You can keep the deposit. This isn't about the money! I began with nothing but a name. He's thirty-five now! We've come this far. Let's keep going! Okay, fine. Just call me later. But you won't answer it! I won't give up like this! What do you want from me? I'll be waiting for your call. I didn't want to say this, but... You're my first! What? You're his first, Ji-woo! No, I'm not! Never mind that. Go back in! Get back inside! Come inside! You should sleep. What's on your mind now? Nothing. Everything's just peachy. You're cooperating with the agency, right? All right. I'll leave you alone. Ji-woo? What zodiac sign is KIM Jong-wook? Dad! Don't wait for me. I don't want to find him. Didn't you get my message? I got your message. But my client was Captain SEO, not you. But he's my first love! Gosh, you're stubborn. I'm not stubborn. These are the rules. Look here. Under article 3, clause 5. What? Where? - Where? - Right here. - "The client..." - Let me see. - "Must not interfere..." - Ji-woo! They moved the press conference. There's no hurry, so take your time! - See you there! - Get a room! Kiss him! Kiss him! Concentrate. I'll read it again. "The client must" kiss him. Hey! You idiot! That's not in there. I'm on my way. You're dead meat once I get there. Dead meat! Go ahead. It's annoying if you fight it. Why'd you stop? You should've gone! - It was yellow! - That's why you should've gone! Are we on delivery or something? Sheesh! How did you ever end up in India? - What? - I'm just saying... Isn't India for people seeking serenity and such? I saw a certain photograph. The moment I saw it, I thought it was fate calling me. I took the picture to a travel agency, and they said India. - Aren't you going? - Oh, right! Show us that pop idol charisma! Yes, fantastic! One more picture! One more pose for the camera! You're a star! Yes! That's it! Here's your latte. Why are you by yourself? They're not here to see me. I heard you have a new boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend! We're just working together on something. Business often mixes with pleasure. No way! Not with him! Never! I hated everything about him from the start. The way he talks, dresses, and even his hair. And he's such a neat freak! I can't wait for this thing with him to be over! You forgot your bag. Hey, wait! Wait! Gi-joon! Holy shit! No word? From whom? That woman. What is she like? The thing is, I'm modeling a character after her for my novel. A living muse, so to speak. I picture her as a woman a lot like India itself. You know... Eyes shimmering with longing. Somehow exotic... But still pure at heart. Just really mesmerizing. Who's that bum? About last night... I'm sorry. What? I said... I'm sorry. Could you speak up? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! I'll take that as your promise to cooperate. 1,108 'KIM Jong-wook's in South Korea Can't you just send me pictures? It's been a decade! He's bound to have changed. Then should I quit my job and follow you around? Couldn't you at least pretend to be enthusiastic? At least I'm here! That's a start, isn't it? I bet your assistant agrees with me. Assistant PARK? Mr. PARK! Me? So are you in or not? I'm in! All right? What if I don't recognize him? Then he'll have to recognize you first. KIM Jong-wook Hey! Kick it over here! Hey You! Kick it over here, I said! DR. KIM Jong-wook I'm sure you know, but we should work on your cup size. He could be disappointed by what he sees. And what if... What if I'm disappointed by him? - There you are, Jong-wook. - Hi. A new girl? She's a looker. A glass of beet juice over here! Make that two! Excuse me, sir! What do you want? Have a wonderful time, sir. Hey! Don't worry so much. Things always work out. I apologize for not being the one. Amen. Hey, wait! No! Don't leave! Wait! That's the last boat, isn't it? What? You did this on purpose! They were right! Men are all the same! Miss? - There's one every half hour. - What? "You did this on purpose!" "Men are all the same!" Do you have any Tiger Balm patches in here? Why would I? It would stink up the car. I sprained my ankle a long time ago. It acts up whenever I wear myself out. Your shoe! Aw, come on! Looks really are deceiving. So unsanitary! What's the matter? Should I go instead? Better yet, let's just turn around. It's all right. There's no promise of a happy ending. One more stop and let's call it a night. Let's stop here for today. Where are you going? - You want a ride home? - I'm good. That was fun. - Let's drink some more! - I thought you were going home! Don't worry so much. I'm buying! - Wait. - Come on! Ji-woo! Mr. KIM Jong-wook? - Who are you calling... - That's him. Stop kidding around, Jong-wook. What are you doing? Just think of it as a toast to KIM Jong-wook. Cheers. What? Put that down. We'll leave, on the count of three. One, two, three! What if the actual guy comes in here? You worry too much. I've been eyeing it for over a year now. He must've completely forgotten about it. But strictly speaking, this is fraud... It's fraud! I'll buy Mr. KIM a bottle if we finish it. It's a one time thing. You're not gonna cooperate? We'll find him before we finish this bottle. You want to find him that badly? Don't you? HAN? What in the world? Look at you! Drinking in a fancy bar! What are you doing these days? Job hunting is tough, isn't it? I'm running a business now. You? HAN Gi-joon, Didi Tour's very own tsunami? Don't talk like that to a CEO! Calm down, Ji-woo. He's the manager! What? A manager? - How dare you talk back to a CEO! - Ji-woo! - Is this your girlfriend? - What's it to you? You're just as twisted as you look. You picked the wrong day, old man! Ji-woo, stop! - Don't mess with me! - We should go, Ji-woo! - You're just a stupid manager! - Ji-woo, let's go. - What are you staring at? - Quick, look away! Who do you think you are? You little punk! Come here! You little rascal! Ji-woo, please! What am I going to do with you? You, young man! What do you think you're doing? Using her first love as bait? You took advantage of my innocent little girl! Don't stare at me! And you made her drink! That's not it, sir... - She drank on her own... - It ends this month! Pardon? I'm not getting any younger. My daughter is a mess, thanks to that KIM Jong-wook! She needs to meet him and put an end to this. What's this? A steak? Classified documents. She must've written it while in India. - The contents are rather... - Rather what? - It's top secret. - Really, sir? To the Blue City. You took a picture of me? Sorry. Let me see. It's nothing. Let's get this straight. It was strictly business. How old is the fellow? - Huh? - Come on, Dad! Don't do that to him. He's just trying to help her. Besides, he looks too young for her. Her signs go with anyone remotely around her age. It's a wide range. Whatever. You were quite a sight last night. "To seize your love, you must look deep within." Whose quote is that? Mine. No, it isn't. I've read it somewhere. Nonsense! - It was in my first novel. - "Yet to Know Love"? You know it? Of course I do! My friends and I loved that book! That's amazing! You girls must've been bawling at the last scene! Huh? Weren't you? Well, I didn't read it. You just said you did. I never read endings. Might not be what I imagined. Oh! How unique. - But you did buy it? - Yes, of course! When will your next novel be out? Soon... It's set in Annapurna, in the Himalayas! Isn't it exotic? Suddenly in the white snow, a woman's corpse! - Pops up out of nowhere! - I see... He looks at it! - The face of his old love... - Someone drag you here again? - Hey, I'm still talking here. - I wanted to thank... They told me to thank you. I don't really remember much. No big deal. Just one ruined suit. My favorite one. What? That was my wife's gift for her brother! Your sister is his wife? No wonder. So this is a family joint, eh? Did you come here to argue about that? Not to thank me? I wasn't going to say this, but I had to burn that suit. And a piece of my soul burned with it. That's why I said thank you! Just thank you, so, so much!! Such a charming girl. 12 minutes between the opening and Cherry's entrance. Check your costumes and finish your makeup. Ms. SEO? - A last minute change. - Yes? Let's delay seating for just five minutes. - Ms. SEO, the audience is... - I'll take full responsibility. - Ji-woo! It's Cherry. - Is her van here? She's almost here, but there's traffic... Seats are filled, so she can't come through the front. - Open the back doors! - Got it! Why are you such a bad driver? You're making me look bad! - I'm sorry, Cherry. - You're so annoying! 10 minutes to curtain! Everyone on standby! Hi, Jae-ha. How have you been? It was great seeing you at the police station. You said you work for NIS. Oh! You moved to the KFDA? How come? You're always stuffing yourself with instant noodles! That's just wrong! Have some integrity, man! Hi, Jae-ha. I'm really sorry. The KFDA is great too. But do you know anyone in the NIS? Hello? Sang-hoon? Hey! Some guy lives in a cabin on Mt. Kariwang. He's pretty famous among the climbers here. They say he's attractive and a bit mysterious. Quiet and keeps to himself. Anyway, he went to India and... - Where was it? - Blue City! Oh, right! Blue! He went to Blue! And his name is KIM Jong-wook! Wow. This'll take at least two days. I can't. I only have Monday off. We'll leave early and get there in the morning. That stupid KIM Jong-wook! A pain in the ass! Golly! You just got mad, didn't you? You got mad at KIM Jong-wook! Wait, don't put that in there! You unsanitary person! You got Diet Coke? How can you drink that? Going to the Himalayas? Where are you going, to a park? Let's go! Hang in there, Gi-joon! You can do it. Do you really need a motion sickness patch? I can't ride trains for long. My body is sensitive. But you worked at a travel agency. That doesn't mean I have to travel. I did the best research, though. Never mind the tickets, reservations, and currency. What about the atmosphere? The aroma of the streets or how the people live... You don't know that. - You're making a face again. - What face? When. Whenever India or KIM Jong-wook comes up. How'd you lose contact with someone that special to you? The day we promised to meet, I missed my transfer flight from Osaka to Seoul. It was pouring that day. It shouldn't have rained in Osaka around then. How would you know? Online research? Hey, I did study abroad and made cookies in Osaka! - Like these walnut cookies? - Traditional Japanese sweets! You don't have to yell! - I should've bought more. - There's one left. - I don't eat the last one. - Why not? It puts my mind at ease. If you don't finish something, the good feeling is left intact. Wonder where the snack cart is... I'm thirsty. Should've thought twice before stuffing yourself. - There's a health drink in my bag. - It's all right. - It's in here somewhere. - Just sit down. Help me, Ji-woo. Come on! Gi-joon! Gi-joon, wake up! - Hey, stupid! - What? We have to get off! - How could you fall asleep? - Cleaning up the rice made me tired! - Why would you bring rice? - We have to eat, don't we? Is this the place? - You know the way, right? - Sure. Hurry up! How far is it to the cabin? It'll get dark soon. I've never been here either. Should we call him and tell him to come get us? Would that ruin the moment? How would you explain where we are? Here? Well, we're... in the woods? I think we're lost. Didn't we come this way before? Sing me a song. I'm not quite in the singing mood right now. Fear is the easiest way to get lost in the mountains. I'm not that kind of guy. Of course not. Rainbow flowers in the summer night. Skipping along the rainbow path. Hold on a second! Of all the songs, you had to pick that one? What? It was my favorite song when I was little. Just sing something else! ? Kiddy kiddy, lovely kiddy kiddy! ? - ? Kiddy kiddy, skipping along the path! ? - Just stop it! ? Kiddy kiddy, lovely kiddy kiddy! ? I said, stop it! ? Kiddy kiddy, my best friend! ? ? I'm not afraid anymore, ? ? because my friend is here! ? Ji-woo! KIM Jong-wook... If I ever get my hands on you... It's Jong-mook. M for mountain. KIM Jong-mook. I'm sorry to let you down. No, that's okay. I got to hike all day, thanks to a certain someone. But the gentleman was incredibly brave today. The cabin isn't easy for a first-timer to find. And carrying a lady on his back, nonetheless. It must've been so hard for him. He literally cried. Another failed mission. He's not some guy you can find anywhere. No, of course not. What a lucky guy, that KIM Jong-wook. I'll probably never be remembered by someone like that. Aw, come on! What's wrong with HAN Gi-joon? You're sensitive, unlike most. And responsible. - And from what I saw today... - What? You're emotional, too. I told you, the sweat got into my eyes! Tell me about your first love. Never mind that. Go on, tell me. You know my story. We were in the same club in college. She had beautiful eyes. Of course. They always have "beautiful eyes". Never mind. Aw, come on. I was just kidding. Please, go on. I waited in front of her house a lot. But I always ran away when I saw her turn the corner. And then I left for study abroad, and I got a wedding invitation in the mail. - Just out of nowhere? - Yeah! So I immediately came back home. Took a plane from Osaka to Seoul. - So you told her? - No. Why not? It wasn't so much that I didn't have the guts. But my feelings just weren't sincere enough. It's okay. It just wasn't meant to be. No. I gave up on loving her. I'm so foolish, aren't I? - Something happen last night? - No! - Sir! - Hi. - Did you have breakfast? - I did indeed. - What did you have? - Cold noodles. Could you go a bit faster? Wait! Watch out! He's so reckless sometimes. No! We're late! Let's go! Hurry! Wait, sir! We can't miss this. What are you doing? Hang on a second. We're now approaching the last stop. We'll find your first... - Where are we? - We're here. I'm so late! Hurry! Faster! - I'll see you later! - Okay! Wait. Later? No after party? An after party for what? There's a famous place across the street. But I doubt they'll have a table. Wonder why it's so empty tonight. Strange. Yes, quite strange. How'd you end up a stage director, when you even recorded a cartoon theme song? I just really loved music. Then you should perform. It's just wishful thinking. That sounds strange coming from you. - You look like you'll fly off any second. - I do? Like an angel with hidden wings... Something like that? - I mean you're nonsensical. - Excuse me? Well, I guess you're right. But you're fine just the way you are. So are you. So are you. KIM Jong-wook. Did you drink too? Dr. JUNG broke up with me. He said I'm too obvious and he's frustrated. It was so humiliating. I thought he was about to propose. What? My diary! Where's the diary? The diary! My diary! What is this? Why do you have this? I found him. Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. - See, I said I didn't want to find him! - No. That's not how you felt. You probably enjoyed missing him and thinking of him. But once he really stood before your eyes, you would've ran away. That day back in Korea, did you go to the airport? I told you, it was pouring that day. It didn't rain in Osaka that day. You just chose not to go. You were afraid that he wouldn't be what you thought. Afraid of ruining the memory of your perfect first love. That's why you wouldn't let it end. It was fun listening to your story. There's nothing waiting for us at the end! Nothing! But you could always start all over again. ID card KIM Jong-wook - Five minutes, Ji-woo. - Okay. Everyone on standby. Watch out! Lights, standby. Go! If we were meant to be, we'll meet again. Watch the wires. Stage left and right, blur on my cue. Go! Cut the lights! This is HAN Gi-joon's cell phone. Hello? Are you looking for your first love? Hello? Weirdo. - At approximately 8 P.M. This evening... - Let's order Chinese. Floorboards collapsed during the performance of the musical "Last Show". The leading actress was injured and is being treated at a nearby hospital. Authorities are now questioning the stage director and crew. Isn't the stage director accountable for this? She's basically accountable for everything. You check the set every day? Yes. - And you monitor the show? - Yes. Then you must've seen the whole thing happen. I'm sorry. Dad. You think you've got it rough? I'm busting my ass trying to raise two girls on my own. So cut me some slack. A normal job and a husband, like everyone else! It was an accident! My life isn't over just because the stage collapsed! So? Is that why no one will take your side? You think that's a good life? Everyone else is busy saving their own skin! Taking all the blame doesn't do anything for you! You idiot. Ji-woo, where are you? You're not drinking by yourself, are you? Hi. Remember me? Do you remember the woman I came with before? The one looking for KIM Jong-wook. She was just here... I'm sorry, Ji-woo. I shouldn't have to visit you... It's strangely tasteless. Excuse me. I'm looking for the writer, PARK Sang-hoon. Over there. Sir. Mr. PARK! I'm LEE Jin-hee, from Soo Publishing. You're suing me? No, Soo Publishing. Oh! Soo Publishing! Come have a seat! No, not here. - Over there. - My goodness! Assistant HAN? Mr. HAN! Some coffee? Yes, sir. - Ms. LEE Jin-hee? - Yes. Have we met before? - No, we haven't. - I see. I hired an assistant because I'm so busy these days. Project: Finding KIM Jong-wook. Client: SEO Ji-woo. Do I have something on my face? Why did you recommend me again? Why not? You already know how I like my coffee anyway. Feel better soon! I understand, but still. We can't find her without a name! My brother-in-law... I mean, my boss is good, but he still needs a name. There he comes right now. Please hold. He doesn't even know her name. Yes, this is HAN Gi-joon. I see. You met her on vacation. Ten years ago, on a plane... She sat next to you? That's how fate works, I guess. Where was the destination? Oh, India... India. Blue City... Your name, sir? All presale tickets can be found here. All performers on standby. I got your message. I've been meaning to call, but... Missed you. What? He missed you. Ji-woo! It's Cherry! Open the back door. Tell her to keep makeup in the van. She said she can't make it. What? We need you inside. I'm really sorry. Wait here! She's stuck in traffic on her way back to the city. - We may have to cancel the show. - Are you insane? Says who? Anyone that knows her part, put them on stage! - Yes, ma'am. - You know her whole part. Huh? No, wait! Sir! Put me down! This isn't what I meant! We're ready to go. Curtain standby. Sound. Go! ? When the sun goes down, ? How much more time does she need? ? And shadowy night falls ? ? Velvety night draped over the city? Standby on mic 5. The other one! Go go go go! No, wait! Mic 7! Go! Hurry up, Ji-woo... SEO Ji-woo as "Hannah". ? Nothing lasts forever? ? Even a heartbreaking sadness? ? will give its way to the next one? Ji-woo! Come back here! Lift. Go. ? It's dark and cold, ? ? like the winter nights ? ? How did I get here again? ? ? I was once not afraid to love? ? But my last destiny? ? keeps fading away? ? Like my heart has never been broken ? ? can I love someone again? ? ? Love slips through my fingers ? ? like sand slipping through my fingers? ? I will love you tonight? ? I want your love? ? You wouldn't sleep through the night? ? Seeing the world you've never imagined? - You were fantastic! - Amazing! How was it? Pardon? Being on stage. It wasn't too bad. Right? Life is simpler than it seems. - Soo-kyung. - Yeah? Thank you for today. Just for today? Be thankful everyday. I will. But how do I get this off? Wipe vigorously. Right. Vigorously. You weren't too bad for a replacement. Should we kick Cherry off the show? An autograph, please! Sorry for making you wait. Thank you. What were you saying earlier? Did something happen? He asked me to find you. Huh? KIM Jong-wook. You found him. No, he found you. You should get going. Everyone must be waiting for you. His flight is at 5 P.M. Once he leaves tomorrow, he won't be back for a while. You should leave by 3 at the latest. Gi-joon... Fantastic show, by the way. That song I sang while hiking, it really was my favorite song. It was nice to hear that voice again. Thank you for everything. Thank you, Ji-woo. Take care. We're closed. What the... HAN Gi-joon! Would you say it's worth the trip? Of course, sir. It's India, the land of spirituality. But why the sudden change of heart? You never wanted to travel... Sir? A certain woman got me interested. It can't be... That crazy girl... You're going together! No. She already went 10 years ago. Then. By yourself? Wow! I need to see just how great it is. Just how great the air is, and the aromas, and the atmosphere... Are you all right, HAN? What's so special about it, huh? She remembers it for a goddamn decade! The air, the smells, and the people... She just can't forget it. I don't understand... Come on, Gi-joon... What's wrong? Huh? Are you going to meet him? I'm not sure. I don't know if he's the one. There you go, all scared again. You won't find out unless you give it a try. What if he isn't? Then it'll just hurt. So you're not even going to try? But what about fate or destiny? If it were meant to be, I wouldn't have to try so hard. That's why you still have so much to learn. When fate gives you a chance, you have to grab it. That must be Ji-hye. I was afraid to commit. I felt like you were pressuring me into it. I guess I just... I didn't... Forgive me, Ji-hye! Marry me! Who are you?! I'm Ji-hye's sister. You two look nothing alike... Hey, Ji-hye! Sweetie. You're gorgeous! What? Gorgeous? Of Mountains, My First Love. By: PARK Sang-hoon. You bastard! Settling down and all... - I was scared. - She got the book all dirty. I felt like you were pressuring me. Marry me, Ji-hye! This is all wrong! You can't propose now! - You're beautiful! Look at the ring! - Diamond ring, is it? What's wrong with you? You're already giving up on your business? What is this, a quarter-life crisis? Pull yourself together! Just stop it! Let me just live my own life! Coming and going as I please, like everyone else. Just let me be free! Gi-joon. To hell with it! I'll just up and move to India! Get a goddamn grip of yourself. You moron! Are you on something? What? "Let me be free"? "Move to India"? Huh? Jesus Christ! Get dressed! Now! Let's check the lights again. Ji-woo. You're actually here early? I'm really sorry about yesterday. And thank you. You're the first one to have it. Should I sign it for you? Why not? Thanks. Ji-woo. - Now what? - An autograph, please. It's you, isn't it? Kiddy, kiddy, lovely kiddy kiddy! - Kiddy, kiddy, my best friend! - Cut it out. I'm gonna brag to everyone. It's 2:30 P.M. Half hour to curtain. We'll find your stupid first love for you... Listen. How can you stop someone who wants to go? - All actors on standby. - We are, already. Go. Upstairs, standby. Go. The light is out. Lighting, quick! Check the sign! You were pretty good yesterday. Huh? Good luck. Wait a minute! Ji-woo! Taxi! Taxi! First Love Agency at your service. If you love her so much, then go get her! Idiot! Sang-hoon! Your 'First Love' isn't always 'THE First Love' Could you go faster? - It won't go into gear. - The clutch! Why did I buy a stick shift? Step on it! Gi-joon! Holy shit! Go get your love! Ji-woo! Gi-joon! You look like you saw a ghost or something. Why are you... Did you think I'd leave too? But... Why did you even come, if this was it? I had to see how it would end. That's how you start over, right? So... How did it end? Hi. Hi. Bye. Let's go. Hey, let's walk all the way back to Seoul! As if. You'll start whining and complaining. I'll be lucky if you don't start crying. Nonsense. Let's give it a try. No, it's okay. January 20th, 2000. Osaka International Airport. Excuse me. I have to get to Korea! Please help me out! I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do. Please. The woman I love is getting married in Korea. One moment. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Can you help him with his open ticket? - Thank you so much! One moment. A flight from India just pulled into gate. You just need someone to cancel their transfer to Korea. But that is highly unlikely. - Can I switch to a later flight? - One moment, Miss. Are you going to Seoul? - Yes. - I'll buy her ticket. - You will? - Definitely! But why aren't you going back? I want to leave it up to fate. Huh? - It's nothing. - Here you go. Thank you. Excuse me! They're Japanese sweets. But don't eat too much or you'll get sick. So be careful. Thank you. Sir! Your ticket! Oh, thank you! Repair and Synchronization by Easy Subtitles Synchronizer 1.0.0.0
