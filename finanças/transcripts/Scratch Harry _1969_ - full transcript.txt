But this time the woods got a jump on me. There I am, folks. A little overdressed, but not bad. Pardon my back. You've all heard that stuff about God being dead. Don't believe it. Anyway, about the beginning of this thing. You're looking at it. Man, this place spooks me. I'd like to join the many who've passed it without stopping. But I can't. This estate belongs to a young lady named Erica Hobson. For the past five years, she shared it with Harry. Her first husband. Their marriage has been unusual. There he is. A guy who survived disappointments that would've wiped out most of us. I mean, most of you. Harry's big hangup is money. Not too much or too little. He just can't seem to hold onto it. (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) - Ursula, get your ass out here. Ooh. Nothing. Yogurt. Ursula! Ursula, where's the coffee? Shut up! Anybody ever tell you you talk in your sleep? Your health food is in the fridge. - Where's the coffee? - [Harry] There is none. - [Ursula] What's that? - Coffee, but it's the last of it. - [Ursula] Thanks. - I told you, sweetheart. No money, no food. Where can you get food without money these days? - [Ursula] I got all I could. - It wasn't enough. - What about rich wife? - Rich wife is a hump. All she can do is send letters, no checks. What's today? She should come soon. - [Erica Voiceover] Dearest love, Harry. Just a short note which I know you'll appreciate. The brevity, that is. The contents, well, you'll just have to decide that for yourself. The Olympics were beautiful, as you might well imagine. Do wish you've been able to be here. - You hump. - [Erica Voiceover] In any case, the games were beautiful and wondrously exciting. And made even more enjoyable by a person I met between Paris and Grenoble. - Without question, must've been another broad. - [Erica Voiceover] She is what you'd refer to as a broad. We made all the sings together, she's fun. I know you'd hate it the way you react to all my friends. But she's great despite your narrow outlook. When the games ended, she and I decided to make an extended tour of Europe. Which is why this letter is postmarked Munich. Naturally, my return will be indefinitely postponed. Perhaps permanently. However, I'll try to warn you is I'm going to return. The money I sent you will have to sustain you until then. Though you may have to curb your luxurious appetites or heaven forbid, get a job. In any case, I'm told that suffering is good for the soul so keep the faith. Your loving wife. - What am I gonna do for bread? - Rich loving wife mean to Harry? - Yeah, it's the way it is, toots. Is this real? - I'm sure it's real. - How much is it worth? - I guess about 200. - Take it off. - No, I won't take it off. - What do you mean, take it off. You're supposed to be in love with me or what? - Oh, come on. - Why not make a little sacrifice while I'm in a little jam. - Harry. - You know Ursula, I'd never really stopped loving you. (cymbals clanging) (fast paced music) Ouch. Oh, come on, this isn't even breakfast money, Pauly. - Listen, baby. You're already into me for too bad, right? Now you come back for more. You're supposed to be paying me back. But you got 10 days to clean this mess up. Or your mother won't recognize you in the level. See? (ominous music) - Something bothering you? - Hey, creep! Wait a minute. There's the house there, that one. The one right past the columns. - Right. - Now, she'll come walking down the stairs. You grab her handbag and run. And I'll start running after you. I'll be right behind you, but don't run too fast. - Like slow motion. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't wise off, slow motion. I'll grab you, take a few punches. You fall to the ground. I grab the handbag and return it to her. - Oh, you play the hero. - Yeah, real hero. - Right. - Get up and get the hell out of here. Go around the corner and wait in the first doorway. I'll give you half the loot. - You better show. - I'll show, don't worry about it. - Cool the punch, man. - Don't worry about the punch, I'm a karate expert. I can handle myself. - Right. (slow rhythmic music) Hey, man, you never told me about no wild animal. - Yeah, I see. Well, let's wait 'til she's alone. - That's overtime, baby. - Yeah, overtime. Punk you and me, local 282. (slow rhythmic music) Charge! Sorry about that, ma'am. What are you hitting me for? I'm here to protect you. Make sure we're off the street. Go on, get out of here. Lucky for you I was in the neighborhood. - I wish you hadn't, I was better off before you got here. - Well, that's gratitude. - What's up? - Carburetor fraction, right near the manifold reduction. You don't believe me? - That's not from the other day, is it? - No. In a way. It's all right. Any guy would've jumped in that way. - I hope it's not too late to tell you how grateful I am. Really. - Oh, it's quite all right. - Thank you. Oh, this is fantastic. Is this really yours? - No, it belongs to a dog. I live across the valley. (tires screeching) Of course, if I hadn't invested in this thing in Montana, things would be different. I wouldn't be in this jam. I really feel if I lost this place, I would cease to exist. - [Catherine] Oh no, you can't lose it. - [Harry] Well. If I don't come up with the mortgage money in two days, I will lose it. - [Catherine] How much do you need? - [Harry] Oh, about four grand. - [Catherine] Oh, that's not so much. - [Harry] It is when you don't have it. - [Catherine] I can lend it to you. (rhythmic music) - Harry? Harry! Harry, guess who's back? Harry! I have no change. (slow rhythmic music) (laughter) - Who opened that door? And who opened this door? These doors are always locked. - [Catherine] Paranoid again. - What, paranoid? These doors are always locked. What if the police are here? - [Catherine] The police? Come on. - Police go every place. Don't tell me I'm crazy, these doors are always locked. - [Catherine] What is the matter with you? - [Harry] As if you don't know what's the matter with me. - [Catherine] You want me to turn off these lights? - [Harry] Oh, go ahead, do whatever you want. Somebody's in this place. - [Catherine] Now, stop, you're making me nervous. - [Harry] Yeah, nervous. Sure, you don't want me to look around. Afraid I might find something? - [Catherine] Where you going now? - [Harry] Upstairs, the green room. Maybe the gold room. Or brown room. Check the wine cellar. The garage, the pool room. The marble room. The tic tac toe room. - [Catherine] Why don't you try the attic while you're at it? - [Harry] How do you know there's an attic in this house? I didn't take you up there. What do you know about the attic? You'd like to see the attic, wouldn't you? So would your partner. Uh uh, toots. See? What are you talking about? - [Catherine] Tell me what you do. - [Harry] There's nobody in this house, I told you. There's nobody in this house. I better go downstairs and shut the door. What are you so worried about? Nobody's here. Oh, don't worry. - [Catherine] Let me have something to drink. - [Harry] That's your job, toots. (slow music) - Harry! C'est moi! - My wife. My wife's friend. A friend of my wife's. My friend's wife. I don't know, wait here. Stay where you are, there's not a thing to worry about. It's probably nobody important. Just don't move. If it's a crook, you know what a street fighter I am. Don't worry, just relax. Stay right where you are. Don't. In fact, get up and hide. Go ahead, hide. Well, well, well, look who's here. When did you get back? - Are you surprised, Harry? Didn't you get my telegram? Why weren't you at the airport to meet me? - No, I didn't get your telegram. Maybe you sent it to the wrong guy. - No, I sent it to you, Harry. I see you're in bed early tonight. How nice. - Yeah, I'm in bed. You know me. Early to bed, early to rise makes a man wealthy. - Congratulations, you found a way. - Yeah, I found a way. Where was my check? - Don't be greedy, Harry. - Greedy? I almost had to pull a bank job to get my shirts out. - Ha ha. - Still as lovable as ever. Bringing me back anything? - No, just me. - You gonna come up or hang around the staircase? - Why don't you come down, Harry? Put some clothes on and I'll fix us something to eat. - All right. Be right down. Hey, toots. What did she do here? Christine. Christine. Oh, sweetheart, here you are. - How's your wife? - If we get caught, you're gonna find out how she is. Just stay here, don't make one sound. Don't make a sound. Try something on. Think it'll fit. Hello, sweetheart. I missed you. What are you doing? - I'm making an omelet. - Omelet? You know how I love omelets. - You'll like this one. - I'll bet. If you sent some money, there'd been more food here. - There's a lot of yogurt. - What yogurt? The yogurt in the icebox, you saw that? Yeah. That's... Fatso, fix the gutters here. He's on a diet. Where did you get this from? Is this from the bedroom or down here? - Why don't you get dressed, Harry? - Let me help you. - You slob. - Just trying to help out. I am dressed for dinner. - No, you're not. Get dressed. - Still the lovable you. Let's go, Cinderella, the bells are about to ring. Grab your shoes, I'll show you how to get out of here safely. To your left. Don't make a sound, come on. Now from here, you're on your own. 'Cause if you get caught, I can still get out of it. See the staircase? Now listen to me. Go around the staircase. And down the stairs. Open the door in the hall. But you have to be very quiet, she's in the kitchen. Will you listen to me? Forget it, you'll get lost there anyway. Go around the same staircase. You see where I'm pointing? Do you see? Go around the staircase. There are twin doors. Open them up, there's a dumb waiter. Rope problem. I better take you. Come here, take your suitcase, come. Take your suitcase. Lovesick broad, you get lost in here anyway. Come on. Get in here. Sit on that log. Don't be afraid. Now wait here, don't go away. This is the fun part. Just wait right here. Come on, get up. Get up, come on! Come on, you're not in grand central station. Come on. Get the bag. Come on. Don't make a sound. Come on. Come on, don't... Will you relax? Do you think you're a prima donna or something? Shh. Don't make a sound, I gotta put on the light. Baby, your port of embarkation. Come here. Smell that fresh air. Spring's right around the corner. Now listen to me. You go down here, go down the stairs. Listen and watch. Turn left, go down stairs. There's a gravel path. Don't walk on the path, it makes too much noise. Walk on the grass. Go right out to the road, you can catch a bus. Right to the station. - Harry? Unzip me. - I wanna close this door, I have bronchitis. Terrible. - [Erica] Hi, I'm Erica. - Who you talking to? What are you, poor batty or something? - What's your name? - What zipper? There's no zipper here. - Christine. - Christine. Would you like to stay for dinner, Christine? - Oh, look at these, I have Indian beads. - Do you like omelets? - Um. - Then it's settled you'll stay, wonderful. - Do you like omelets? Then it's settled, you'll stay, it's wonderful. Erica, let me tell you about my beads. Several years, I traveled out west. I have beads you haven't seen yet. Alone at last. How you been, babes? Did you miss me? Sure you did. I missed you. Oh wow. New ring. Always buying yourself presents. You never think of me. You know, I need a new bathrobe. How've you been? Gotta be independent. You still love me, you know you do. Remember the fun we used to have? Remember our honeymoon? You didn't forget our honeymoon, did you? You know what your letter did for me when I received it? I had tears in my eyes. I slept with it under my pillow. - It was a telegram, Harry, a telegram. I never sent you a letter in my life. - What are you talking about? Hey babes. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You have to believe something. Just believe, I'm sorry. I'm not really a guy like that. I'm really not. It shouldn't have happened this way. It should've been you. But life isn't what we want it to be, hon. I have to have money to live. She turned me to a way of life that's very expensive. I just can't get out of it. I'm not such a young cookie that I can go out and get a good job. You know it would've been different had I met you a long long time ago. All these things we talked about could've come true. Beautiful reality. Believe me. I was really falling in love with you. (clock chiming) At least appreciate you that you stay here and listen to what I have to say. 'Cause I know you believe me. I know you do. - There was an interesting tar going on in France while I was there. A Frenchman surprised his wife in bed with her lover. In some sort of jealous rage. He picked up a gun and shot them both dead. The jury more or less exonerated him, they just said, naughty naughty. - Will you put that thing away? What are you doing? - It would be interesting to see if the reverse were the same. Sometimes women just don't have a chance. Of course, that could never happen in this country. - Are you kidding? They'd hang you without even thinking twice. - Hang me? Harry, I wouldn't shoot you. This is just a little something I picked up that reminded me of an amusing story. - Amusing. - After all, we are civilized people, aren't we? Somewhat knowledgeable and understanding regarding the inevitability of certain behavioral patterns repeating themselves. - What're you talking about? - Why don't you go upstairs and get dressed for dinner? - All right. That was about two thirds of the money. And what was left of it, I had invested on a landing field up in the back 400. You never know what this area is gonna become. It's good to have transportation out here. Could make a good book. Then the rain situation. So Peterson fixed the gutter and told me that he spotted some termite rot up there. It'll cost about $1600 dollars to fix and he wouldn't let me take it on credit. He wouldn't take it on credit. He told me I had two loose molars in the cavity. So this debt had to be paid so in turn, he had to be paid. You're interested in that too. McKenzie comes and cuts the grass. That's the last of the money. I had to pay him for that. And as a good pal, he pruned all our spruce trees. 400 trees. 420 trees. Pruned and pruned and pruned. You're laughing. You have a human quality. - You're too much, Harry. - You're still in love with me. If you had sent a money order instead of that dumb letter, I'd have money and the house would've been just beautiful, it would've been our honeymoon cottage all over again. - [Erica] I never sent you a letter. - [Harry] You're a hump. You're a first class hump and your feet stink. - I think you should tell me about your little affair. It must be fascinating. - [Harry] Can I have the lighter, Christine? - [Erica] Tell me, Christine. - [Christine] Harry and I happened to meet when he rescued me from an attacker. - [Erica] Harry rescued you from an attacker? - I saved her life. You'd have been dead. - Shut up, Harry. - [Christine] He rushed off afterwards. - May I have the lighter? - [Christine] Naturally, I had to find him to thank him. - Sweetheart. May I have the lighter? Christine, may I have the lighter? - Let's see, where was I? Oh, following his stunning very natural laws. - [Erica] When my check didn't arrive. - [Harry] May I light my cigarette? - Something about oh, a discotheque in Montana. - I've always loved the outdoors, you know that. - You didn't know he was married? - No. Well, I never even thought about it. No, of course not. - You just didn't think anything about it. A variable whirlwind courtship. Harry, you outdid yourself. I hope you didn't fall in love with him. - Well. You know. - [Harry] Oh, you just break me up. - Well. Maybe I should tell you about my innumerable affairs while turning coffee. - Countless, countless. - [Erica] Oh, they were marvelous. Yeah. - [Harry] Countless. - Countless. - [Harry] I assure, countless. - It was sort of an ideological investigation. There was a German neo-Nazi. A Spanish fascist. And an Italian communist. And a Swiss, no Swedish sorshistad. - [Harry] May I have the lighter, Christine? - With the Spaniard, it was sort of like an inquisition. - [Harry] Christine, may I have the lighter? - He wouldn't take his clothes off. He just undid the zipper and, you know, very unsatisfactory. With the communist it was from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Very satisfactory. And the neo-Nazi, let's see. He was a bit hung up on racial background, you know. He finally consummated the affair at five o'clock in the morning and rushed off town. And the Swede of course, committed suicide. Right after. And the goalist demanded gold. - [Harry] Hilarious. Just hilarious. What did you do in the night? - [Christine] She's funny. You are. - You're a hump. - [Christine] Oh, she's funny. - Well, why don't we go into the living room? Who's Harry? - Harry doesn't exist. - Harry's a phantom. - Harry's a ghost. - Harry the floating red shirt. - Harry's a bastard. - Harry's an ass. - He's a fool. - He's an idiot. - He is empty. - He's full of gas. - Floating in the sky. - Floating in the sky. Harry's something that climbs around the house every now and then. - Harry's had enough. - Harry is a number. - Harry is a bad trip. - Yeah, Harry's a bad trip. (classical music) What's the matter, Christine? - You know. I'm sorry this thing happened. I'm sorry for you. I didn't know. I didn't know he was married. I didn't know anything. Really. He's been so nice. I guess I should leave. - No, you mustn't be sorry and you mustn't be sad. And you can stay as long as you like. (classical music) (moaning) - I'm going for a drive now. And if you're not gone when I come back, I'm calling the police and I'm gonna tell them the few things I know about you. - Look how one glass of wine can rouse up a beautiful romance. I think she's serious. Now you see what I have to contend with. It's been like this for years and years. That's the kind of woman I'm married to. Wicked, mean creature. Sweetheart, she's prehistoric. She's sick. She's sub human. - [Christine] Harry, you're so full of shit. (rhythmic music) - Christine? Christine? What in the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to get out. - Relax, toots, relax. - Where's Christine? - She took a bus. - Harry, maybe you didn't understand me. I said I'm gonna call the police. - I told you not to threaten me. - It's not an idle threat, I'm calling the police. - You make that call, your name and picture will be splashed right across tomorrow's newspapers. (screams) - What have you done? Harry, you stupid. What have you done? - Baby. - What have you done? - What have I done? What have you done? Oh my goodness. - You shot her. You shot her. Harry, she's dead. - Sure looks it. - You shot her. You shot her, you bastard! - Relax! Just relax. Just relax. You're a murderer. Well, she sure as hell ain't sleeping. Come here, sit down. Come here. - You stupid ass. You'll never get away with this. - It just so happens she was more my friend than yours, so don't be like so concerned. Okay? I've known her a long time. You just met her today, yesterday. What's the big deal? You know, women are so... Look. If heaven is such a great place, what's the big deal? We probably did her a favor. - You've gone crazy, Harry. - Good, I'm crazy. I had no choice. You know I had no choice. I happen to owe some money. If I don't pay it off, we're gonna get bumped. If you had sent me a check, none of this would've happened. I just don't got the energy to go out and find a replacement for her or for you. - You'll never get away with this. - So how to do it? I did it with your gun. And I wore gloves. And your fingerprints are on the gun. But I've hidden the gun. I don't want any act, just keep quite and listen. I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen. We wanna sell every single thing we have here. Including the house. You gotta transfer everything you have to comparable European firms. Transfer the whole works into your name. And to my name. 50-50, I'm very generous. I could take everything at this point, couldn't I? And we'd just move to Europe. Have a nice little house. Your garden, picket fence. Putter around. The house will have to sell privately because I don't want real estate agents running around here because we're gonna have to bury her on this property. If I had a bigger car, maybe we can dump it tonight. I can't put her in that two seater. Can't. We'll have to put it here with the bags and everything, it's safe. You call Robby. Tomorrow morning right after breakfast. I'll bet he'll be here right before lunch. He's wanted this place. We'll get rid of the house, maybe tomorrow, the day after. Write a few letters to some friends. Make some telephone calls. And telegrams. And move to Europe. Forever. And the car. Have to take the car with. Yeah, Robby. No finer chap to dump this. Excess pool on. - Bastard. - Any suggestions? - You'll never get away with this. - I've gotten away with it. You killed her. You killed her. Your fingerprints are on the gun. Just dismiss the rest of it for me. Just forget it. You killed her. - You're insane. - You're the murderer. I'm insane? I could turn you in. I'm sticking by you. Go find another friend to stay by our side. Use your head, toots. You're a murderer. See the picture now? Don't think I'm such a louse. I had to do something like this. - Oh god. - Oh your little act, just come on, you can't be that shook. - [Erica] You're insane, Harry. You're completely insane. - All right, you're a doctor, I'm insane. She's dead. You killed her. I'm gonna help you out of it. No one will find the gun. Not even you. And that's it. It's that simple. Well, show some emotion, do something. Why don't you run upstairs and get ready for bed. Where you going? Make me some warm milk. Nice glass of warm milk before I go to sleep. These women, they never understand. So long, toots. Better luck next time.

I don't hear a noise. Oh, that's me. I'm playing with my knees. - Is Harry digging up my lawn? - Harry? No, Harry's in the house somewhere. I don't know. No, no, that's a wood chuck out there. - Listen. - Let's go inside and have a look, shall we? - Harry is digging back here. - No, no, no. Harry's inside. Come on. - Listen, you know, I tried to buy this place from your father. - Yes. - I tried to buy it from your grandfather. - Yes. - I'm only 30 years old. But I'm not gonna have Harry digging back here. I got news for you. From now on, Harry is not even gonna be here. Let alone digging my lawn. - Oh, Harry is perfectly all right. Harry's in the house somewhere. Harry wouldn't hurt a thing. Harry won't be anywhere. Let's go. - Somebody's digging back here, my dear. - What should I... - If I could just... - Hey, Robby, how you doing? What a surprise, how you been? Good to see you. - What are you doing there? - Just digging up some worms. Tuna's running like crazy down the crick. Come on in for a drink. Sign the contract. Got a brand new pad. Tell me about your trip. You look fine, real fine. How you been? - You're looking good, Robby. - Well... I'm just so pleased to get this place. - Rob, it's been so nice. We'll see you again soon. - Good seeing you, pal. Good seeing you. - Harry, thank you. - Say hello to Marage for us. - Certainly will. - And the whole gang. - [Robby] Well, we may just start a little branch here. - [Harry] Oh, I bet you're gonna start a little branch here. Things grow beautiful around here. - [Erica] I owe you a hug (mumbles). Right, Harry? We've been so happy here. - [Harry] That's the truth. - [Erica] If it's half as good as it'll be, Rob. - It'll be better if it's half as good. It's wonderful. Good luck with it. We'll drop you a postal card. All right, you hump. Get in there and make some dinner and let's start getting her out of here. Drop him a post card, nothing else to do. Sweetheart. Sweetheart, it's me. Come on, baby, what's wrong? - Oh. - I don't like this separate bed, separate bedroom business. - Oh. - Some marriage. - Jesus Christ, Harry. You're hard enough to take when I'm awake. Will you let me sleep? Just let me sleep. Get out! (rattling) (slow music) - Are you some kind of creep or something? Take off that cape, we're going to the airport. You can't be too conspicuous. - [Erica] I'm not going anywhere, Harry. - What do you mean you're not going anywhere? - [Erica] You now what I mean. I'm not going anywhere without the gun. - Will you stop being a child. I'll buy a gun in Europe. They've all kinds, antiques, new ones, used ones, what not. Millions of guns. Europe is a gun. - Harry, there's no point in me leaving without that gun, is there? - You know, I thought we'd get to the airport a little early and have a nice romantic dinner in that place with the big window. We can watch all the airplanes. Get in the car and take off that cape. - Harry, I told you, I'm not going anywhere without that gun! - Creep. The gun is in the grave. It's in the grave. You want me to dig out the whole grave? Are you crazy? I'm not digging out the grave. Get in the car! - [Erica] I don't care, Harry. I want that gun. - Right at the last minute. You're a child. You're some kind of child. Right at the last minute. You're a hump, toots, a hump. Here you are, toots. Where do you want it? - Put it down. - What? - Put it down. - What, put it down? - Put the gun down. - What do you mean put it down? What's... - I've been waiting for you to get that grave open. It's right were you belong. - Where did you get that? - Part of the set, Harry, a pair. - Oh, sweetheart, I love you. - You're finished! - You hump!
