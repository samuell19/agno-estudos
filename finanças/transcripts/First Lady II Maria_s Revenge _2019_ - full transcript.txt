Is my son okay? - Yeah, he good, he at my house. - What about baby moms? - She okay too, but they killed Liz. Ay yo, what that Cisco dude look like, that you said shot you? - Dude had a tat on his face and some dreads. - Yeah, that's the same guy that killed her. - So the beef is still going, just like we thought. This shit ain't over with. Look, I was talking to the guy that killed Mike, but I did not know it was the same guy until I was about to sleep with him. - Wait, what? - What the hell you mean, killed Mike? And how you know he did it? - He had on a rosary that mIke gave to me. - How did you know it was the same rosary? - I know it was the same rosary because I can never forget how he was trying to give it to me. It's the exact same one. - What did you do? - I took from him what he took from me. - So now what? - We have to go at them like they came at us. - Look, I need to come home. - Nah, bro, stay there, you need to be health when you come. - I'm healthy. - Look we can't handle it. - You know, I'm starting to think you two don't want me to be there. - Come on, bro, it's not like that, you know we need you, just not now. - I hear you.

Real niggas do real things, you already know. - All right. - Yeah. - You feel me? Sorry about Liz. - [Dreco] Yeah, I'm sorry 'bout that too. - It's all good. - Yeah, I heard it's the same guy that wet me out. - You need to go get that nigga, straight up. - For real. - In due time, baby. Ay, why don't y'all go ahead and cut, man? I'mma chop it up with y'all tomorrow. - All right. - What you want us to do? - Just lay low. - You sure? - Absolutely. - Shit, we out then, come on, bruh. - Come here. - Let me look at you. God, thank you. I was so scared they was kill her in my house? How did they even know where I live? My name ain't on nothing there. But you know what, I bet you it was your little hot ass son. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? He's been selling whatever he can get his hands on now for the last few months. - Well, shit, why didn't you stop him? - Stop him? How are you gonna stop anybody from doing whatever it is that they wanna do? And besides, you keep disappearing, not me. - Now Robin, you know that was some bullshit. I would've never left. You know what happened. - But now, he's following in your footsteps. You should be so fucking proud. - Man. I tell you what. You think we can do something to stop him? - Yeah, we could try to talk to him. But I'm not sure at this point if that's gonna work. - Well, bring him to me. - No, nobody can know you're here if the plan's gonna work. I mean, I've been fucking with Cisco for a minute now and nobody knows that. And besides, when I was in the feds, my mom was watching him for me. And they don't even know I was fucking with you. So now, he went to go kill him because he doesn't have a clue where you are. - But you know what, they'll know soon enough. Go ahead and get outta here. I'mma see you later. I love you. (Chuckling) - You love me? I love you too. (Lips smack) (footsteps receding) (heels clicking) - Baby, what's going on? Baby, are you all right? - [Patrick] What the fuck do you want me to say? - You know, I can leave. - Baby, listen, look, I'm sorry. I just need to think. - Think about what? - How I'm gon' kill this bitch. - You know, is it really that important to you? - Yes. - Listen, I'm here now and we can start a family, you can kill the world and it still wouldn't bring her back. - But it'd bring me some peace. I need peace, hell, I need my wife. She was my best friend. - Well, if she was your best friend, then why were you cheating on her? - I was a fool and that's why God allowed that bitch to take my wife. - So you believe the reason why your wife is dead is because you were cheating on her? Baby, I mean, did you do something in your past that brought this on or-- - Something like what? - I don't know, did you buy something and didn't pay for it? - Hell no. - Look, baby, I just want us to be honest with each other. And I love you and I'mma do whatever it takes to make your heart feel better, okay. (Lips smack) (doorbell ringing) - Let me get that. (Knocking) (metal rattling) Can I help y'all? - Hey, how you doing? - [Bracey] I'm Detective Bracey, this is my partner, Detective Richards. - [Richards] Nice to meet you. - Can we have a minute of your time? - For what? - I got a couple questions to ask about your wife. (Door rattling) - My wife? Man, my wife is dead, what else there for me to answer? - Like perhaps, do you know who killed her? - If I knew who killed her, y'all would be taking me out in handcuffs right now. - Well, you know, your daughter gave us a call. She said it was a lady you were seeing or dating or something like that. - My daughter? Man, my daughter is taking the death of her mother really hard, all right. If I knew who did it, I would tell y'all or I would kill her myself. - Her, how do you know it was a her? - What you talking about? - What are you talking about? You said you woulda killed her. How do you know it was a woman that killed your wife? - Man, y'all just told me that my daughter called y'all and told y'all that it was a woman that I was seeing. Look, nobody is taking the death of my wife harder than I am, all right. - Seeing ain't believing. Seems like you made a quick recovery. - Yeah, she been here for me. She lost her husband and her son too. - Listen, detective, I feel like you're really outta line. - Really, how so? - Your line of questioning isn't right. - How would you possibly know about our line of work? - Because I'm assistant prosecutor, LaToya Freedman and I'll be making a few phone calls in the morning to see if this is really how police departments are supposed to handle their cases. - Well now, no, ma'am have yourself a nice day. - Have a nice day? Man, you ain't talked to me like that. What y'all need to be doing is getting out in these streets and finding out who murdered my wife, whether it be a man or a woman. - Woman. - Detectives, have a nice day. - [Bracey] All right, see y'all soon. (Door creaking) - Bitch! When were you gon' tell me? - Tell you what? - That you was a prosecutor. You said you were a lawyer, you never said anything about being a prosecutor. - And you never asked, listen, I don't go around telling people, hey, how are you doing, I'm assistant prosecutor, LaToya Freedman. - Okay. - And besides, if you're not doing anything illegal then why does it matter? - Because it does, I feel like I'm dating a cop. - And once again, what's wrong with that? Listen, baby, I'm here to help you, not hurt you. And I can help you in many ways, but if you know something about your wife's murder you need to let them know. - I can't tell on her. - Why? - I just can't. My daughter seen it all. - So she's seen your wife's murder? - No, but she seen the woman get into the car. And later that night we were at the gas station, she seen a car that was similar to it. - So she never actually seen your wife's murder? - Thank God, no. But she did overhear the conversation of me cheating on my wife. She asked if she could go to a boarding school because she couldn't stand the thought of being in my sight. (Sighs heavily) - When was the last time you seen her? - I haven't. - Well, do you want to? - Not for the reason that you think. - Why? - I need closure, all right. - Listen, I think you need to let me know who she is so I can have her ass picked up. - No. - Why not? - She destroyed my family. - So let me destroy hers by locking her ass up. - It's not gon' be good enough. - Listen, baby, I hope it will be because once again, like I said, I love you. I would kill for you. I will lie for you. And again, I love you. ♪ Hit me with that sugar I know you been fiending ♪ ♪ Like you are the queen, and queen with the, yeah ♪ ♪ Hit me with that sugar putting down that act right ♪ ♪ Yes, we didn't act right, come and get some, yeah ♪ ♪ Come and get some sugar ♪ - Did you finish all of your homework? - Most of it - What do you mean most of it?

I feel like if I don't have it, I might get killed. - Where did it come from? - You know you asking a whole lot of questions. - Baby, because I love you and I care about you and I wanna know everything about you. - Everything? - Yes, everything. (Sighs audibly) - All right, well, I had this best friend, he was more like a big brother to me. And an uncle that used to give us his work to distribute. He found out that he was thinking about quitting. - So, he wanted to quit, what's wrong with that? - Nothing. But he knew that the only way to leave this family is in jail or in a box. And I told him. I told him. He said he had to do it anyway because his girl is gon' to be a doctor. (Sighs audibly) My uncle told me if I wanted his spot that I had to kill him. So I did. And now this is the only thing that I have left. - So that's the reason why you didn't want the police involved in your wife's death, because you killed somebody and you didn't wanna feel like a snitch. - Man, the streets take care of they own business. - Now, baby, I understand. When will you every change? - Change, change? Never. - Listen baby, we can leave all of this. We can go hoe and pack out bags and listen, we could just get out, we can get away from this place. - You don't understand, you don't. The only way you leave in this family is jail or in a box. - So your uncle won't let you have a pass? He made you kill him.

I keep letting people down. - No, don't-- - I let my baby down. - No, she was hurt because she had lost her mother. - No, Cisco is right, that shit is my fault. - He's an asshole, okay and we will fix this, okay.

You know, since my brother back, think I'mma fall back a little bit. - You don't look like that's what you wanna do. - It's what I have to do. My brother just not the same. It's like he got a death wish or something. You know, I used to think that he loved his son, but now, I think he just want him to be just like him. - Well, maybe he understands that he's gonna do what he wants him to do, regardless of what he wants him to do. So, maybe he feels the only way is to keep him close and maybe he can save him. - That don't make sense. - Well, it makes sense to me. - Yeah. - Man, dawg, losing his mind again. - What's going on? - Man, he just put a mil on whoever brings Cisco and Patrick to him. - Well, if that's how he wanna spend his money, then so be it. - Man, he making the hood hot again, we was just good. - Did you tell him that? - Man, he ain't listening to shit I say. Man, tell him to go back to where he was. - I can't do that. - Why not? - Because honestly, I'm done with all of this shit.
