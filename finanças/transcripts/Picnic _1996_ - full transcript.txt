Can I see your pass, please? Drive on. Out you come. Welcome back. You'll be living here from now on. We'll all get along fine. Mamma! Papa! We appreciate it. Thank you. Hello, Coco. Come on, Coco. Sit here. Get changed. Get changed, I said. You won't be needing these. I like this. Is it your favourite? Stop fighting me! What's going on? Nothing, matron. That's lovely. What is it? - The sun. - Is it, now? And what's this? It's a road. A road? Those eyes and the mouths all around me. I see them. - Is this a mouth? - Yes. This is an eye? Yes, it is. It's very scary. Scary, is it? Yesterday's dream... You must draw it. Dream? You dream, don't you? Won't you participate? I didn't dream. I dreamed lots of black and white squares. There were so many... A jumble of black and white squares. I don't understand. Only black and white? I wanted to use red but there weren't any red ones. Is that so? Hey, what's your name? Coco. I'm Satoru. Where are you from? Hey Tsumuji. Do you like her? Like who? That new girl. The black raven. Not particularly. What about you? I really like her. From way back. Hey, Tsumuji! What have you done now? What are you hiding from me? Not you again. You broke the classroom window, didn't you? You can't fool me, I know everything. That was Koichi and Ryohei, it wasn't me. Then who stole Murakami's lunch money? That was Kazuya. Not me. Why do you always put the blame onto others? Why don't you believe your students? You call yourself a teacher? Preaching to me now, are you? Tsumuji... What? Sorry, but I need to take a leak. Can you unzip me and pull it out? These days I'm always bursting, and I dribble afterwards. What the hell?! Get out the way! I can't hold back! Feels good. Then please go away. Tsumuji, you really are a good and gentle boy. I know better than anyone. You reckon? How could you have done it? Done what? More denial, Tsumuji? Did you forget about June 20th? It rained that day, didn't it. Tsumuji... Why did you kill me, your teacher? Go away! Why is the black, black raven so god damned black!! What are you doing? What's with that get up? You'll get into trouble. What are you doing up there? Watching the outside world. What can you see? The earth. That's not the earth, it's just a road. Where are you going? We're going exploring. Come on and join us. What's wrong? What about your exploration? We finished. Is that all? But it continues on. We're not allowed past there. Why not? It's prohibited. Come back! As long as I don't cross the wall, isn't it okay? Hey, what'll we do? Tsumuji! Back inside everyone. You should be practising. Everybody back inside. In you go. What are you doing up there? What are you all doing? What? What's all that? What's that song? It's a hymn. What's a hymn? It's a song in praise of God. Would you like to come inside? Just wait here. Come on. What's wrong? We can't. Why not? We're not allowed to. Why not? It's outside the bounds. You're not allowed off the wall? Maybe you are angels from heaven. How about if I go up there? Good idea, isn't it? It sounds great from here, too. Where are you from? A long way away. Really? You believe in God? That's my job, isn't it? You really believe? I certainly do. There is no God. There's no such thing. How do you know? Any fool knows that. Have you ever prayed to Him? Yes, I have. I pray every day. He never answers my prayers. What did you pray for? The end of the world. Why pray for that? It would be great. You're so sinful. I know when the world will end. When I die. It began when I was born. So when I die, it will end. That's bullshit. It's true. You made the world? No, Papa and Mamma did. If there is a god, it's my Papa and Mamma. Because they're the ones who created me. They'd do anything for me. But they dumped you here. No, they didn't. Yes, they did. They didn't! You don't understand anything. Stop that! It's dangerous. Okay, that's enough. Just stop it. You've both got it very, very wrong. I want you to read this. Lord, please have mercy on these poor souls. Hey, Tsumuji! What is it? God does exist. That's what it says here. He made the world. It's all bullshit. But I believe it. Believers will be saved. I am saved. What about me? You're damned. Why? You don't believe. Okay, I believe. Who created the world? Papa and Mamma did. There you go. You can never be saved. That's all bullshit. Who's going to be saved from what? An angel with black wings. It's forbidden to cross the wall. Don't you understand? This won't hurt you. This won't hurt you. Don't... Stop it! Stop! Please...! Ohh, that feels great! Nothing like the first piss of the morning, eh Tsumuji? No! Please, stop! - Come, drink up. - Don't! Drink! Drink it down! Please! Leave me alone! Tsumuji. Tsumuji! Am I still dreaming? When will I wake from this dream!? And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls in heaven, "Come gather unto the supper of the great God." "That ye may eat the flesh of kings, captains and mighty men," "the flesh of horses, those atop them, and the flesh of all men" "both free and bond, both great and small." See, I told you! You're not allowed to. Not allowed to what? You went to the punishment cell. It's no big deal. You're just acting tough. Does it frighten you? What's so funny, Tsumuji? The world is coming to an end. That's bullshit! He's right, it's all crap! It's true, It's all written here. - What's that? - The Word of God. - What? - The Word of God. There is no god. Yes there is. But your god is a fake. Your parents are god, huh? Exactly. Why can't they be god? Okay, so don't believe. You're damned anyway. But I'm saved. Believers will go to heaven. Non believers all go to hell. Will I be the only one in heaven? It'll sure be lonely. Okay, I have a question. When will the world end? When will the world come to an end? I want to be saved, too. How can I? First, you must believe. Okay, I believe. Hey, save me... What's up, Tsumuji? Get lost. I said I believe, so save me, Tsumuji. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: For the time is at hand. That means soon, doesn't it? How soon is soon? Save me! Please save me. Come on, save me! The 10th of July. "Published on July 10, 1997." July 10th? So let's all go and watch. Watch what? The end of the world. Doctor! We'll get put into the punishment cell for this. Don't be stupid. The world will end before then. Yeah, sure! That's right! Farewell to earth! Hey! Let's have lunch. Not until we get there. Hey, Tsumuji. Thank you. Lucky Coco. Hey you! You're from the institution, aren't you? You're listed as escapees. Get down! Get down, I said! Oh no! Come on, help me! What are you doing? Help me! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Come back! Don't go! Let me have a go. Wish I had a pistol. Or a doll. A lovely pistol. A lovely doll. Hurry up or we'll leave without you. Did you find something? What's wrong? Did you find something? Hey Tsumuji. I can't see him anymore. Let's wait. Let's wait for a while. Tsumuji! Hey, Coco! Tsumuji! I must do it. Climb the wall. Climb the wall. Fall down the wall. Fall down... Climb the wall! Here, have this. Stop, please stop! Go away! Leave me alone! What's wrong? Did you kill someone, Tsumuji? Why do you ask? I can smell it. You smell like a killer. Who was it? Mr. Sengokuya. Who's he? The creep who was my grade school homeroom teacher. He hated me. He used to torment me. I thought it would end when I went to junior high... but he went there, too. Then when I went up to high school... he was there, too. He continued tormenting me. I had no choice but to kill him. Then one day I hid myself at the grade school. I waited for him. Weren't you in high school by then? He taught there. What about high school? Mr. Sengokuya. And junior high? Mr. Sengokuya. It rained that day. He went out through the back gate. I stabbed him in the back. He died immediately. Did you feel better? I killed someone, too. My twin sister, Kiki. We were identical twins. She was always imitating me. She imitated me but called me a fake. Said I was an imitation of her. What a joke! Then one day we decided to see who was the fake. We both took a stranglehold around the other's neck. The first to die was the fake. Naturally, I won. She died frothing at the mouth. That proves she was the fake. Did it feel good? Kind of. But it made me feel a little guilty. He won't forgive me. God has forgiven me but he won't. So what? The world's gonna end soon. Your sins, and my sins will all be blown away! Look. This is the last rain to fall. The world's last kiss. Here. How is it? Will we see it from here? ...a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood. What's hell like? What about heaven? I prefer hell. Heaven would be so boring. I wonder if hell is hot, or cold? Hot, I suppose. How hot? Hotter than the sun? Tell me! Give me the gun. Just give it to me. If I hit the sun it may explode. You're a lousy shot. I guess I'll just have to die. I'll wash away all your sins. You bastard!
