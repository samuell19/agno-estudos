What other guy? What are you talking about? The other perp. l think it was just that guy. You pinky swear about that? There were 2. Yeah, 2. Let's find them then, guys! Come on ! You take the front, we'll take the back, all right? Yep, absolutely. JUSTlN: All right. All right! Chang. Do not Tom Cruise run. Yeah ! Whoo! That is living, man ! l still taste that guy's sweat in my mouth. Congratulations. That is the taste of victory, man. lt's your first collar, dude. Dude, that was way too close. Seriously. What's the worst that could happen? "Simply wearing a police badge is "punishable by 1 year minimum in a federal--" What the fuck? "The use of official police equipment. . . "is punishable by up to 2 years in a federal penitentiary." "Driving a vehicle with red or blue lights is punishable. . . "by up to 3 years imprisonment and $200,000 fine." What about a whole damn police car? Everybody get down (SHOUTlNG) (KlDS SCREAMlNG) (KlDS GASP) Which one of you little pricks asked me what l do all day? l'm a cop. (CHUCKLES) Joey, hop in. Out of my way. Take a lap, little boys. (CHUCKLES) (SlREN WAlLS) He's a cop, Ron ! He ain't shit! (RYAN LAUGHlNG) l love it, man. Look, you had a great shift. You keep it up. . . and l'll give you that badge l promised you. What the hell have you been doing? Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. And who is this? lt's Joey. He's our intern. Ryan, are you insane? No. We could go to jail for years for this shit. And now you have a little kid involved? Who's this bitch? (SNORTS) l will slap that little afro off your head. You're good. Dude, this is it, all right? Take the uniform off. We're throwing them away. We are done. Seriously. You wanna retire? (CELL PHONE RlNGS) JUSTlN: Shit. This is Chang. You're good. JOSlE: l need you to come down here right away. l'm at Georgie's. Wait. What's wrong, Josie? Please come down as soon as you can. Hurry. Yeah, but just tell-- Hello? Damn it. Did you hear that? Looks like we're coming out of retirement, homeboy. We gotta go around back to surprise them. RYAN: All right, here's what we're gonna do. l'm gonna bum-rush in, l'm gonna say my killer line. . . then you come in and repeat everything l said. No. Ready, and. . . Yippee-ki-yay, bitches! Everyone down ! Yippee-ki-yay, bitches. . . Everyone. . . So you're the new sheriffs in town. Acting all hard when l'm not here. Well, l'm here now. Huh. Are you the new boyfriend? Can l talk to you for a second, please? All right, boyfriend. RYAN: All right. My buddy's gonna handle this. Okay? That's real steel. You don't mess with the Chang. Listen, you gotta leave her alone now. l'm not even talking to you like a police officer. This is just me talking to you like a regular guy. So this is you without a badge? Yeah. lt's just man-to-man. (SLAPS) Okay, let's backtrack a little bit. So l'm a cop now-- (SLAPS) You did it again. Yep. (SPEAKlNG OTHER LANGUAGE) (THUGS LAUGHlNG) (SOBBlNG) You think you can fuck with my business? Are you threatening me? l'm a cop, asshole. You ain't shit. What? You wanna jump? Come on, bitch, let's go. Let's do it. Come on, let's go. Jump. You're not worth the paperwork. (SPlTS) (WHlSPERlNG) l'm the law here. Back off. . . of everything. Next time you come to a call like this. . . who knows? (lNHALES SHARPLY) Bullets fly. Cops get hit all the time. JUSTlN: All right, so we're just gonna come clean and tell these guys everything. Everything except for the fact that we've been pretending to be cops. What? No. lt's called taking responsibility. This shit has gone way too far. lt sounds stupid, man. lt's not stupid. lt is stupid. lt's smart. By principle, it's stupid. Justin, you could still stop right now. Shut up. Hi. Listen l don't know where to begin-- l should probably do the talking here-- Shh. l guess we want to file a police report. Mmm-hmm. What kind of report? Uh, he and l have been pretending to be cops for the past couple of weeks. Excuse me? lt sounds crazy. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. lt started out just as fun. . . but now we're in a lot of trouble and we need help. From real cops. Hold on a second there, Angie. Don't believe a word these guys say. Oh, fuck. These guys are a couple of real jokers! SEGARS: Let me guess. You guys came down here to help me fill out all that paperwork. . . you ditched us with the other night, am l right? That's right, yeah. No. Good to see you guys again. Come on back. We're gonna go back. This guy is a rascal. No, l'm being serious. We're really not cops. That's not funny. George Segars, he said don't worry about it. Help me. Please! See you, Angie. JUSTlN: We're not cops. lt's not funny. SEGARS: His name's Mossi Kasic. He's top of the shitlist. l'm surprised you guys haven't heard of him. l deal with guys like this on a daily basis, Segars. l hear you, Sarge but this guy is different. He runs a crew, preys on local shop owners. . . and immigrants like himself. He muscles in. . . takes co-ownership of the businesses. . . and then uses it for money laundering and whatnot. He's an animal. MOSSI: Hey, beautiful. SEGARS: You can't reason with him, can't talk to him. He loves to fight. He lives for it. (MEN SHOUTlNG) He's got this crazy temper. He can snap, just like that. lt's all right. (GRUNTS) SEGARS: He's taken down some big scores. Everytime we raid his place, though. . . nothing. We can't find anything on the inside. l gotta say, l want this guy bad. lt's good to hear. l want him bad, too. l think about it every night. Me, too. l just lay awake, staring at the ceiling. . . just thinking about different ways to nail him. l'm obsessed with nailing this dude. l wanna put him up on the wall, you know, and just-- (GRUNTS) "What's my name?" That's right. Anyways, that's probably never gonna happen. What's going on, guys? Nothing. We were just talking about Mossi. Nobody in the community's gonna testify against him. . . and without hard evidence, we got nothing. So why don't we do surveillance? Believe me, l'd love to do that, but it's a little bit above my pay grade. Right. However. . . between you and me, Sarge. . . Everything is. SEGARS: This station has a shitload of equipment. l'm talking about wiretaps, pinhole cameras, anything you want, l can get for you. (WHlSPERlNG) l want all of it. All right. Let's do it. Yeah ! Hey, Sarge, Brothers in Blue, should we sing it? Sing what? lt's the academy song. Come on. Oh, yeah, yeah. Fire it up. (SlNGlNG) Brothers in blue That's good. This guy never stops, does he? There's a police song? l gotta learn that. You're a fucking idiot. (POLlCE SlREN BLARlNG) We were supposed to turn ourselves in and now your checking out equipment? Dude, you heard the cop. lt's up to us to get this guy. He is the devil's nephew. We're not going near that guy! So let me get this straight. You finally meet a girl that you like. . . and she likes you, and then some douchebag comes around. . . and says that you can't be with her. . . and your first thought is to run away? Yes. He said he would kill me. l'm not gonna let you run away, man. (SCOFFS) You know what? What? You wanna know what people say about you? l know what they say. But l haven't felt like this in a long time. l'm good at this. l need you, man. l need you to. . . l need you to believe in me, man. Please. l'm in. (CHUCKLES) Were you about to cry? Yeah, l don't wanna talk about it. l got misty, my heart started pumping fast. So how are we gonna find this guy? This is it. God, l'm getting good at this detective stuff. ls that why you're wearing that suit? Oh, yeah, l got promoted. You promoted yourself again? Yeah. l'm a detective. JUSTlN: What do you think they're doing in there? l don't know, man. Something shady, that's for sure. Let's see if we can get inside and open those doors. Let's see if we don't do that. Listen, Chang. . . you've gotta stop being such a pussy, okay? Yeah, no shit. Dude. . . l will whoop your little ass. You will not touch his ass. l will hit him. (SLAPS) Don't you fucking hit me. Don't! Oh, perfect. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLlCKS) lf l wasn't involved in a case right now, l would light you up. That right there, that apartment, that's our vantage point. But somebody lives in there. Justin, then they better have good food. . . because they're about to be involved in their first stakeout! No. (KNOCKlNG ON DOOR) RYAN: Police business, open up now. Hi. You are a fox, aren't you? Detective? Absolutely, that's my title. Dude. Uh, ma'am, we're gonna need to come inside and talk to you for a minute, please. Oh. RYAN: All right. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLlCKS) Oh, yeah. lt smells like a fish farted in here. Look at that bald one. He looks super racist. Like he snores the "N" word at night. l've seen every cop show ever. l'm so excited we're going to be doing this together. Yeah. Just so we're clear, there's no "we" in this situation. Don't be a dick. l can still be a part of the team though, right? Absolutely. No. Also, l'm not on ecstasy. No way. l've had some very dramatic relationships. My therapist says l need to meet a more stable guy. l love a man in uniform. You do? Sure. l don't like this. l did a three-way once with two paramedics. Ma'am, l'm going to need you to go to your room. All right. Alone. You do not know what vibage is, pal. Why would you do that? l think she's an interesting lady and she's got a lot to offer this team. We are doing surveillance. We don't have time. Ow. (CAMERA CLlCKlNG) All right, we got action, people. Oh, good work, Joe. Who is that? l think he's the boss. Take photos of his henchmen. You got good ones? How fun is this? l'm sorry to bother you, but l need some help. lt's my bubble bath. lt's not wet enough. No. Yes. That's our civic duty. JUSTlN: No, it's not. Focus. (CHOKES) We would love to help you, ma'am, but we can't. . . because we're on a case and we take our job seriously. That is so hot. You're so hot. MAN: (ON RECORDlNG) Listen to me very carefully. I need you to lay low. Very low. For now. The Dominicans are going to make the delivery. And you're not going to do shit with it until l say so. Understood? You gonna keep everything underground. Underground? What is he talking about? Deliver what? l don't know. JUSTlN: What's this? This is the shipment. This is our evidence. JUSTlN: How do you know that? Because it's a cargo van, and these are all bad guys. JUSTlN: These guys are terrible-looking people. Open it. Oh. . . Shit. So? They tell me their badge numbers don't match up. Which tells me one thing. They're not LAPD. Oh, we're dead. So, what are they? Feds, ATF, maybe a special unit. What? Yeah, we're black ops, dude. So, you're going to be invisible until l can figure it out. ANNlE: Just to be clear. . . if that little guy wasn't here. . . some serious weird shit would be going on right now. What kind of weird shit? RYAN: You are an acrobatic angel, aren't you? Ah. Joey, turn around. RYAN: Oh ! JUSTlN: Okay. There she goes. RYAN: Boom, we got them. Now what's in those crates? l'm seeing it the same time you're seeing it. How would l know that? l need to narrate it, because that's what you do in these situations. You see something and one of the guys says it out loud. And the other guy, you, is supposed to go, "Yeah." RYAN: Oh, shit, dude. We gotta know what's inside those crates. JUSTlN: So, what do we do now? Joey, watch the fort. Where are you going? Wait a minute, actually. Oh. . . (MOANlNG) ANNlE: That is so hot. RYAN: There he is. This is a terrible idea. ls it? (SlREN BLARlNG) Dude, are you kidding? No. He's a gang member. Exactly. Relax, l'm just gonna go talk to him. l will not relax. You're an idiot. l got this. Hello. You have the right to remain silent. . . (MAN SCREAMlNG) Here we go. Justin, help me now! Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. lf you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed-- He's biting my neck! He's biting my neck! Ow! (PANTlNG) Can l talk to you for a second? Sure. (SHOUTlNG) What the fuck! We've gotta find out what's in those crates. Are you kidding me? l'm not-- No! Get in ! Get in the car! Okay. So we're kidnapping people now? No, Justin, it's called an interrogation. Where are we going to interrogate him? (ELEVATOR DlNGS) (MAN SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH) (WHlSPERlNG) He's just a friend. He's just a friend. (MAN CONTlNUES SHOUTlNG) (MAN SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH) RYAN: We gotta get the information out of him about what's in those crates. He doesn't even speak English, dude. Then we torture him. You're the mysterious one. You have to be bad cop. So now l'm torturing him? Hey, who said anything about torture, Your Honor? You just did 3 seconds ago. Shut up, dude. RYAN: This is a serious moment. Make him talk. You can do it. All right. You can do it! Yeah, born ready! (MAN CONTlNUES SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH) Listen to me, you little dick-snatch-- (SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH) (SPlTS) (SCREAMS) What was that? He spit in my face. He's not afraid of me. You know what, then make him afraid of you. Reservoir Dogs, dude. Cut the ear. Be realistic for once. (STUCK lN THE MlDDLE WlTH YOU PLAYlNG) Lift up that side. l'm trying. RYAN: What's in those crates? What's in those crates? This is not how you waterboard. Yes it is! Have you seen Zero Dark Thirty? No, but l know how to waterboard, though. Stop drinking it! (MAN SCREAMlNG) (BOTH SCREAMlNG) (GRUNTS) What the hell, man? lt's sad what you're trying to do. lt's embarrassing. All right. l hate Mossi. Everybody does. l'll tell you anything you want to know. Just stop this shit! Why didn't you say that before? And that you spoke English. You didn't ask. You guys pulled me out of my truck. You drag me across the fucking ground. That's on me. You throw me in the back of a cop car. Point the guns in my face! Look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot here. Yeah, maybe. You want a beer? Yeah, beer sounds good. What's your name? My name is Pupa. lf we untie you, do you promise not to freak out and kill us? l promise not to freak out. PUPA: Ah, man ! For real, l don't know what's in those crates. But Mossi paid some heavy cash for whatever's in there. But how do we find out? Mossi's having one of his parties tonight. l hear shit gets crazy. At least 3 people die, everytime he has a party. What? Those crates will be there. . . but if you wait until tomorrow that shit's going to be gone. So we gotta do it tonight. You gotta do it tonight. (LAUGHS) Shit, this game is gangster! Really? Gangster? lt is, man, l tell you. Where can l buy this thing? You see, Pupa, it's kind of complicated. There's a lot that goes into making games these days. Oh, Justin. A lot of politics. l'm talking to a lot of people. lt sounds like you bitched out, is what it sounds like. You gotta go in there and fight for your shit. Don't you believe in yourself? You gotta go in there and tell them. . . "This is my game. We're going to do it my way. "Put the game out there now, for people to buy it." l gotta say, we have to get into that party. We gotta get in that party tonight. l don't understand what you're saying. When you start getting excited, your English escapes you. . . and you get really native in your tongue. How do we get into that party? When l'm speaking English but it still sounds like. . . (SPEAKlNG lN OTHER LANGUAGE) Like that, l don't what you're saying. PUPA: You didn't get any of that? Qué? PUPA: You didn't get any-- Qué? Holy shit. What? What? This is gonna sound a little bit weird. . . But you two could pass as brothers. Ew! No, this guy's gross! No offense. No offense? You just said, "Ew." The last person who said, "Ew" to me, was my mother. Hmm. PUPA: You guys know where she is right now? Heaven? You got it. Heaven. Hopefully from natural causes? lf me getting angry and doing something foolish is natural causes. . . then yes. You look handsome. Thank you. A great-looking guy. Now l'm here to play war. Hey, Chang. How do l make you. . . look like him? (SlGHS) Shit. How much time we got? Uh. . . Shut up. l need a water, three bowls and a lemon peel. Come on, people, let's go! That's my girl. She said she'd done a three-way with a couple of paramedics. Mmm-hmm l think this the marrying type. Sounds like it to me. All right. Are you ready? RYAN: We're ready. PUPA: Oh, ho-ho. That's handsome. Well. . . l look like someone hit me in the face with Lil Wayne. (PUPA AND RYAN LAUGHlNG) Lil Wayne! He made a joke about Lil Wayne! Oh, shit! That's funny. Hey, Josie, l gotta say you're one heck of an artist. Thank you. PUPA: You're fine, too, girl. Yeah, she's pretty. Josie, Josie, look at me. Look at me. Don't do intense right now. Okay. You're crazy fine, that's all l'm saying. RYAN: That's a compliment, now let it go. (WHlSPERS) Just gonna say one more thing. l wouldn't, though, is what l'm saying. l promise it's going to be okay. l mean, l would like to take off your dress. . . and put my penis inside of you. l'd really like to get all up in that shit. No, like in her vagina, though. RYAN: l know, but you can't say that. Appreciate it. l wouldn't put it in your butt. JOSlE: l gotta go. PUPA: And a good day to you, madame. Do you think l could put "Undercover sting operation for the LAPD" on my resume? Absolutely. Did you see when l said "madame?" That's French. That was sweet. Here you go, buddy. What if l start sweating, dude? These tattoos are gonna run down my face. Then don't sweat. What do you mean, "Don't sweat?" l'm not doing this. Why you got to be such a bitch? Pupa, don't call me a bitch. You made such a cool game. lf you make it, then you got to play it. l've been saying that this whole time. You made such a cool game, (CHANGES ACCENT) now you gotta play it. What are you doing with your accent? What are you doing with your voice? l was agreeing with you. But you have an accent. l know you are agreeing with me, but you're saying it like l was. What l'm saying is, you made a great game and l believe in you. So, now, you just gotta (CHANGES ACCENT) play it. All right, dude. Feel free to rob him. Oh, boy. He can't hear you. l'm just going to ignore him from now on. How is this on me? This is insane. Listen, Justin, no matter what happens. . . no matter what anyone says to you, all you gotta say to them is. . . (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) What does that mean? lt means, "Suck my balls and cock, you cocksucker." Yeah, just say that. Okay. Good luck, homes. You're gonna need it. (LAUGHS) Look, l'm telling you, we look a lot alike. But Mossi is probably gonna recognize that you're not me. . . and then he gonna cut your face off! All right. ls that--? What are you talking about? Whoo! l'm sorry. lt's not funny. Wait a second. What? PUPA: One extra touch for you. Pretty good, right here. Oh God, no. Just trust him. Put it in. You put this in your mouth. Ow. Ryan ! You'll need it. You need it, man. Here they come. Ow. Ow. Aah ! (MUSlC PLAYlNG) l'm going to die here. lt smells like prison and bad parenting. Oh ! Oh ! RYAN: (THROUGH EARPlECE) Relax! You'll be in and out. All we gotta do is find out what's in those crates and you'll be done. We'll get footage of it, and you're out. That's easy for you to say. They are all staring at me. Then stare back at them. You are a cholo vato killer! Own that shit! l suck balls and cock. Ah. Coño. That's what l thought. Ah, dude, l think it's working ! Hell yeah, Chang ! You tell them ! (CHUCKLES) (HlP HOP MUSlC PLAYlNG) RYAN: Nice! Okay, we're in! Dude, those chicks are hot. (WHlSPERlNG) Shut up, dude. l'm freaking out. Just relax.

You've got some balls coming in here. THUG: Come with me. Mossi's gonna wanna speak to you. Been looking for you. Okay. (WHlSPERlNG) Shit, what do l do? RYAN: I don't know, but don't be nervous. But don't fuck it up, either. The fuck are you doing here? l best not be finding out you lost one of my crates. RYAN: Make him say what's in those crates! Um. . . What exactly are we referring to in those crates, bro? Hit this shit. Nah, bro. l'm already super piped-out. l was like, this pipe, that pipe, every pipe. You know what l'm saying? You feel me? Coño. l didn't ask. Just do it, dude. He's testing you. (COUGHlNG) (ALL LAUGHlNG) You just got cranked up, fool. (CONTlNUES COUGHlNG) Ryan, what did l just smoke? What does "cranked up" mean? You just smoked crystal meth, dude. Crystal meth? It's not going to affect you. lt's not going to affect me? What are you talking about? Right there! They have a basement! You gotta go down there. No way, dude. Frigging twitching right now. Do not puss out now! l'm pussing out. Listen to me. You gotta go down there and see what that was. You listen to me, all right? l'm having a heart attack right here! All right, just open up that window. Okay. Okay. (SCREAMlNG) RYAN: Why'd you hit me in the face for? lt's me! Move! l've got an awesome entrance. Fuck, yeah ! That wasn't cool. What the fuck are you wearing? Here's where we're at. l did some intel, and that's their safehouse down there. As the leader in our situation, l'm gonna check that out first. You're gonna hang out in the hallway and stand guard, okay? What? No, dude, l'm on crystal meth ! l know, it's awesome. l'm very jealous of that. How fun is it? l've done it 1 1 times. Eleven? And l smoked crack once. Let's go! No, please. Don't leave me alone here. Please, l'm itching. l've got this post-nasal drip thing going. (SNORTS) (RETCHES) Don't do that! You're gonna make me-- Don't-- Hey! Think about something else.

Hold my hand. l'm not holding your hand. Dude, l think l'm addicted to crystal meth. You just smoked it once. Oh, my God. l would suck dick for this high. You've got to be kidding. l wouldn't, but what if l do? l don't want to suck dick. Because l know l'm gonna get good at it. Oh ! (LAUGHlNG) Shit! Look at all these lights! Not the lights. We're excited about the guns, right? Right. Right. RYAN: Holy shit. Justin, it's the crates. Check it out. Jackpot, dude. Jack-motherfucking-pot. See these tags? Yeah, man. You know what these are? These were confiscated by the police. Yeah. They were supposed to destroy this shit. He stole all this. l feel real good right now. l want to build a porch. We should build a porch ! Right now! That'd be great. Right. l don't even know if l'm good at woodwork or anything. . . but l feel like l can do that. Mmm. Dude, look at me. Hey! Hey! Hey, hey. You wanna go crazy, dude? No. Neither do l. Thank you. That makes me feel like a leader. Holy shit. You know what this is? Clothes. This is actual SWAT gear, man. Let's be real. We're never gonna build a porch. We're just lying to ourselves, man. l just want to die, dude. What the hell is going on with you, man? Something's going on inside my heart. lt hurts. Let's go, meth head, now. l'm sorry. Now! l'm sorry, man. l feel so sad ! RYAN: Stop. RYAN: (WHlSPERlNG) Whoa. Look at how far this one goes. What are you doing? This is so white trash, l don't even know what l'm saying. (JUSTlN VOCALlZlNG) What is that sound? Our heroes rise from the depths of Hades! Stop, dude. You're getting so scary. Hey, man, where are you going? Wait up. l got it. Mossi looks like the original General Zod. Hey! Aah ! Hey. You and me, right now. Wait! l'll rip your head off! (METAL MUSlC PLAYlNG) (CROWD CHEERlNG) Timeout, okay? (GROWLS) Seriously, guys! (RlNGlNG) (GRUNTS) (THUDS) (lNAUDlBLE) (MUFFLED LAUGHTER) (THUDS) (ALL CHEERlNG) Uh-huh. Who's next? Fuck. Check it out. lt's a jackpot. What? Look, with the guns. . . with the SWAT, and Mossi's boss, l got all his guys pinned. l've got enough evidence to put this guy away for years. That's great, man. Remember that long tunnel? See where it leads? lt leads to Georgie's. Oh. That's why he wants Georgie's so bad. lt's not about money laundering. lt's about having control. . . of both ends of the tunnel. Do you see? Why? That's the right question. Do you remember Segars said that every time that they raid Mossi. . . they come up with nothing. He's using the tunnel as an escape route to get rid of all the stuff. l cracked the case, man. l'm getting so good at this that it's scary. Where are you going with that? To the police station, to turn it in. No, you're not. We're mailing it in. . . anonymously like we said. Justin, come on. This is my collar. No one can know this was us. What is wrong with you? l worked hard on this. Why are you getting so pissed off? Because l almost died in there! All right. Look at my face! l smoked crystal meth ! That's not funny! All right. And for what? So you could have some self-worth for once? Where is this coming from, man? l didn't do this for my self-worth or whatever! l did it to get a guy like Mossi off the streets. . . and we're going to! Unlike you, who runs away. . . anytime anything in your life gets tough ! And maybe that's why you're still nowhere. Oh, l'm still nowhere? Me? Yeah, you. You've been moping around for 8 years! Complaining about, "Oh, life screwed me. That's why l didn't go pro." Life did screw me. That's why l didn't go pro. You jumped off a roof at a pool party. That's how you injured yourself. Be careful of where you're going right now. Life didn't screw you. You screwed yourself. Take some responsibility for once. Why don't you act like a man for once, because you might like the way it feels. You know what? Everyone was right about you. About what? You're a loser. (DOOR SLAMS) Be a man.

Yeah. l gotta get this in the right hands right away. Can you help? Detective Brolin. You've heard of him. He's in charge of the Organized Crime Division. He's gonna love this. Might as well go straight to the top. Straight to the top. (ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG) Let's do this. Mmm. What's up, baby girl? Carl, park in my spot one more time and l'm gonna punch you in the dick. Larry! Fuck you ! Okay. Okay. Okay! All right! (KNOCKlNG ON DOOR) There he is. Detective Brolin. l would like you to meet Sergeant O'Malley. O'Malley, this is Detective Brolin. Pleasure. Yeah.

There's some things in here l didn't put-- lt's okay. lt's okay. l wanna take a look at it anyway. Sergeant O'Malley has been doing some surveillance. . . of Mossi and his crew for quite awhile now. l think he's got some good stuff in there, sir. He seems pretty excited about it. Give us a minute alone. Yes, sir. Not you. Relax. (DOOR SHUTS) Who are you? (SLAMS TABLE) l asked a question. Who are you? Before you do anything, l already made copies of that. Do you have a family? Are your parents still alive? Yeah, my parents are alive-- No. l am running a routine undercover investigation. . . to bring down Mossi Kasic. . . and you're interfering. That's not true. Oh, it's not true? No. Well, whoever you are. . . l suggest you run, very far away. . . and grow eyes in the back of your head. . . because you're never gonna know when it's coming. Do you know who l am? l'm the guy who's gonna-- Take me down. You've been watching too many movies. Yeah. But l'm still gonna take you down. So l guess we'll see. l guess we'll see.

We can give the firefighters superpowers. (STAMMERlNG) lt's just. . . (lMlTATES STAMMERlNG) lt's just what? JUSTlN: lt's just your idea sucks shit, Todd. What was that? l said your idea sucks shit. Justin, where are you? Call me as soon as you get this. You know that mobster, the guy we thought was Mossi's boss? He's a cop. And he's got all of our evidence. . . which means Mossi knows everything. Holy shit, dude! We're dead ! Dead ! Dead ! Okay, no. Everything is gonna be fine. Nothing can trace back to us. MAN: His name is Ryan O'Malley, and he currently lives with this guy. . . Justin Miller. Okay, print everything out and bring it to my office. Hold on a second. l found the problem. They're not even real cops. What do you mean they're not real cops? Just what I said! We gotta take care of this right away. Get it done! l want the word on the street, underground ! Anyone who gets them ! You're not even supposed to be in here, let alone talking. A bunch of shirtless firefighters. . . spraying zombies with their hoses? What kind of game you trying to make, bro? l'm gonna give you one second to get the fuck out of here. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You like that? This guy is crazy. Yeah, ese. Now, a few weeks ago. . . l pitched you a game and you didn't listen. That really hurt my feelings. You were there. So were you. Now, l'm going to pitch my game again and you're going to hear me out. . . or l'm going to beat the shit out of everyone in this room. And l've fought women before. l didn't win. . . but l'm down to redeem myself. What if we made a game so visceral... that it made you feel like you were in real life danger? To feel like it's about to go down? Don't think of it as a game. Think of it as a real life experience. (ELEVATOR DlNGS) (RYAN PANTlNG) You are a cop. (SlGHS) My game is about getting into situations you wouldn't be in in your normal life. Situations that are dangerous. Real. Where it felt like you could actually get killed. (SlGHS) (GUN COCKS) (GASPS) (OPERA MUSlC PLAYlNG) (THUDS) (GASPS) (GUNSHOTS FlRED) Aah ! (WHEEZlNG) Real violence isn't like in the movies. THUG: There he is! (GUNSHOTS FlRED) (SCREAMlNG) Gunfire is terrifying. Bullets are sick. They blast and rip through everything. (RYAN CONTlNUES SCREAMlNG) But isn't that what people want, right? To really feel what it's like to be in the shit? (SCREAMlNG) That's what l'm talking about, people. WOMAN: Excuse me. Justin, there is a police officer in the lobby to see you. (CHUCKLES) No, no. You can tell Ryan to wait, please. Justin ! Do not go home! l'm coming to your work! We are in a lot of trouble-- (TlRES SQUEALlNG) No, no, no. No, no, no! l can assure you that l will make this thing more real. . . than anything you have ever seen in your life. How are you gonna show us this realistic violence, huh? Freeze!

(CELL PHONE RlNGS) JUSTlN: Dude, where the hell are you? MOSSI: Are you having fun? Justin Miller. You wanna be a cop? Average police response time... 1 2 minutes. Average time it takes for a man to bleed out, 7 minutes. You do the math. Ryan. Ryan ! Don't come, Justin! Run! Run! (PHONE BEEPS) Ryan ! Fuck! (PHONE RlNGlNG) Officer Segars. Segars, it's Justin. Who? lt's Chang. l'm Chang. Chang? What the hell, you piece of shit! l'm hearing all kinds of crazy things! I know, I know. And what you heard is true. We're not cops. lt's true? But everything I'm about to tell you right now is real. Mossi has got Ryan, and he is gonna kill him. He's got him in an underground tunnel beneath Tirana, Mossi's club. What underground tunnels are you talking about? It's their safehouse. And there are cops involved. They tried to shoot me. Hey, you better watch what you're saying, Chang. Just come to Tirana, and you'll see it for yourself. Please! Where are you right now? (SCRAPlNG) How are you doing, partner? Long time no see. Mmm. You have the vest on. That's not gonna help. You're gonna die today. And so is your friend. So the best thing you can do is just tell me everything. Who did you give the evidence to? How many copies do you have? Your choice. You go quick and painless. . . or you're gonna endure something that is. . . unspeakable. (BRAKES SQUEALlNG) Hey. What are you doing down there? Josie, you gotta go, okay? Take Georgie and Lydia and get out of here right now. What are you talking about? Don't come-- l'm not a cop, okay? Why do you keep saying that? lt's complicated. But what's most important is that you leave right now. Then, if you're not a cop, who the hell are you? No one you want to know. Now go. Sorry to bother you gentlemen. l need to come in. . . and take a look around. (MUFFLED MUSlC PLAYlNG) RYAN: Just don't hurt him. This was my idea. Just let him be. l'm the only one-- Hey. One of your pigs is upstairs. l thought you had control of your cops. Uh. . . No, no, no, Mossi, listen. Mossi, listen to me. You think he's gonna protect you? You think a guy like that is gonna protect you? Think about this. l've got evidence to put him away for years. You don't think he's gonna cover his tracks with you? Huh? Think, Mossi ! What is your backup plan? (COCKS GUN) No, no. No. No, please. No, no, no, please. No, no, no! (GUNSHOT FlRED) No! Shit! (SCREAMlNG) That's my backup plan. JUSTlN: Ryan ! Ryan !

We didn't mean to screw you over. lt was never our intention to pull you into this. l don't care. Get upstairs and get outside! And take that thing off. That's a uniform. You gotta earn it. You understand that, "Sarge?" Now get the fuck out of here. SEGARS: 6-Adam-7. l need backup, now. JUSTlN: What are you doing? (DlSTANT GUNSHOTS) l can't do this. He's outmanned, he's outgunned, and it's my fault. You were right. l gotta take responsibility for once. That's not what l meant. Wait! What, man?
