Hi! Hey, George Jones. I missed you, too. Oh, Baby Girl! We weren't expecting you until next week! - Surprise! - Yay! Baby! Mom! Oh, baby, you're home! Here you go. Have you seen our Instagram? She's got 563 followers. And the new logo. It's on the website, too. I liked the old logo. Well... Why'd we need a new one? Just let the poor girl eat, alright? Sorry. The sauce tastes different. Did you change Grandpa's recipe? No, not exactly. What does you mean, "not exactly"? Oh, Callie. We ran out of Grandpa Tucker's original recipe, like, six months ago. So now it's store-bought. Shipped from New Orleans. - Store-bought? - Mm-hmm. Seriously? What happened to Grandpa's recipe? Oh, we can't seem to find it now, can we, Willa? You lost it? I didn't lose it. Dad never wrote it down. Well, if you would just clean out your desk drawers just once in a blue moon, My desk is a pristine palace compared to yours. Well, at least you two haven't changed. Yeah. What about Tucker's Fall Music Festival? Oh, of course! That is a Tucker's tradition! Yeah, but so is Grandpa's sauce, Aunt Willa. You can't serve store-bought at the festival, and you know it. Well, the way the ticket sales are goin', sauce is the last thing I'm worried about. I'm going to find that recipe and make a batch. - He said he'd write it down. - Well, he didn't, and I have looked everywhere. Trust me. Ahem. I reckon we're going to have to talk about this later, ladies. How do I look? Alright. Honey, wait. Oh... we should have warned her. But you said we should mind our own business. Hang out next. I picked every song. I think it's going to be... Guess who. - Callie! - Hey. When did you get back? I just got off the bus. Are you glad to see me? Of course! Welcome home, Callie! It's so good to see you. And thank you for your service. Yeah... You know, I should have written you about Lynne. I just... I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. We said no strings, right? I didn't expect you to wait two years. It's okay, honest. Don't beat yourself up. You know, I took over Brad Oshi's practice, right after Christmas. For like the first three months, I was the only pediatrician in Lockhart, and... That ain't an excuse, I'm sorry. It's okay... It's okay. Can we still be friends? Sure. Of course. You coming in? Yeah. In a minute. Take the truck. Your room's all ready. And I'll see you back there, okay? Thanks, Mom. "Tucker's Roadhouse. Owned and operated by guitarist John Wakefield Tucker. The cradle of country music, where Martina McBride was discovered..." Come on, let's stop. Don't you want to see where they discovered Martina? I don't know what a Martina is, Dan. Don't you want to sample the "best barbecue east of the river?" They got live music every night of the week. There's no stops. It's just up here on the right. Come on. When are we going to be in Tennessee again? It's kind of a once in a lifetime thing, man. You don't want to be on your deathbed, thinking you missed a chance to sample historic barbecue. I'll be on my deathbed soon enough if I don't show up on time with Jillian's birthday present. Luke, you've been working non-stop. You've gotta slow down. Isn't it your job to make your clients work more, not less? Well, your agent is also your best friend, who doesn't want to see you burn out. It's not healthy, my friend. Look! Tucker's! Right here! Come on. Alright, we'll do your Tucker's. Are you okay? - I'm fine... - Are you sure? Oh, dear God. Great. I think we're okay, thank goodness. Callie, what happened? Are you all right, honey? I'm fine, this guy just came flying in... I'm not sure that I was flying, but okay. Well, it is a parking lot. Well, as long as nobody's hurt, right? We're at fault. We're at fault. We're sorry. We were flying. Again with the flying? What am I, a bird? Is there any damage? No, I think he just hit the wheel. Listen, if you find even a scratch, in even a month, don't hesitate to call me, okay? My name is Dan Cartwright, I'm his agent. - His agent? - Yeah. Luke is an award-winning television director. Again, if there's any repairs needed at all, we promise that we'll pay for it... And thank you for your service! Do you represent musicians, Mr. Cartwright? Oh, my gosh. Come inside. Best barbeque east of the river. - Willa! - What? You might find your next Grammy winner right here at Tucker's! Unfortunately, we're kind of on a tight schedule. Daniel. Yeah? Yeah, the car's not starting. Oh... Looks like you'll have some time after all. You gonna eat that? ♪ There's a place I go ♪ A place only I know... Sorry, boys. Looks like that pyro switch knocked out your power supply. Can you fix it? It's kind of a... a birthday present for my girlfriend. I could... If I had the part. You know classic cars like this, parts are hard to find. Yeah. Maybe they got it in Franklin. I'll give 'em a call tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow. Look what time it is. - I'll get back to you. - Thank you. ♪ Down by the river ♪ It's where I... Well, my sister was against it, but I said, the room's just sittin' open, and people are always looking for vacation rentals, and when I say Sam Hunt slept here, I mean, that is no lie. Of course, he wasn't famous then yet, bur who cares? - Sam Hunt. - Yeah, I heard. So... here we are. If you get cold, there's an extra blanket in the cupboard, and hangers, soap... What else? Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Oh, my pleasure. Oh, shower's brand-new. Really excellent pressure. And my sister might be singing tonight if you boys want to come down. I think we're kind of tired from the drive. Of course. Well, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite! Joking! Okay. Well, I didn't see this one coming. Of all the places to get stranded. Come on, buddy. Relax. No, I don't think I will relax. I think I'm going to listen to country music all night from this bed. I thought you'd be asleep by now. Thanks for not turnin' my room into your sewing room while I was on tour. Well, for one thing, I don't sew. You know what I mean. At least something's the way I remember it. Is this about Joe or the new logo? It's everything, Mom. I know it's silly, expecting to come home after being gone for so long and to find things the way I left 'em. Maybe not silly. A bit unrealistic. What are you writing? I'm trying to remember Grandpa Tucker's recipe. I always helped him make it. We'd make a batch every summer, remember? He'd throw in pinches of this, dashes of that... He said he'd write it down. Oh, honey, I thought he had, but I have looked everywhere. I bet I can remember it if I try hard enough. Our reputation's at stake. "Best barbecue this side of the river." I don't care two pins about that. You know what I care about? Having you home, safe and sound. I missed you, Callie. I missed you, too, Mama. Stop worrying about some recipe. And get some sleep. I'm on a mission, Mom. No ingredient left behind. Well, some things don't change. You're not gonna find it in there, I already looked. Doesn't hurt to look again. Oh, before I forget, can you... Can you pick up these donations in town? Sure. Thank you. Aunt Willa... what's this? Is Tucker's applying for a loan? The sound system needs an overhaul, there's no two ways about it. As a matter of fact, I'll go to the bank today to get a low-interest payment plan. Excuse me. Do you guys happen to have anything for a headache? Also, this is a gift... From your dog. I appreciate the gesture, pal, but I think it belongs to you guys. Good morning, Mr. Ellis. How are you feeling? Rested? How was the mattress? The mattress was very comfortable, - thank you, Willa. - Good. How about a fresh cup of coffee? Good cure for a headache. That would help. Thank you. I'll see you two later. Wish me luck. Good luck. Alrighty. You might want to plug your ears. This is gonna be loud. What's that? Almost done! Unrelated question... You guys ever think about sound proofing that room upstairs? Not a country music fan, I take it. It's not really on my playlist, no. You should give it a shot. Country music is special because it allows people to share their truth and to share their stories. Do all the stories have to be sad? I think I heard "cheating heart" at least a hundred times last night. Open mic night. The beginners go for Hank Williams. He's Willa's favorite. She says he's the Shakespeare of country music. Does your aunt own this place? She and my mom do. That's my Grandpa Tucker. He passed while I was deployed. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, look, I want to apologize for yesterday. I feel like that was my fault. Okay, I should have been more careful. I'll take some of the blame. Driving while being a cry baby. Cry baby? Should I ask why? Not unless you want to hear another Hank Williams song. Cheating heart? Not quite. Joe and I didn't make any promises. I was deployed for two years. Can't expect a man to wait that long. That depends on the man. High-school sweethearts. Too young to know our own minds. Sounds like you're taking it pretty well. My grandpa always said, "trouble is transportation." A bad thing can take you to a good place. Speaking of which, do you think your truck can maybe take me into town? Are you callin' my truck a bad thing? No, ma'am, I'm calling your town a good place. Nice save. - Thanks. - Sure, I'll give you ride. Appreciate it. You comin'? Right now? Mm-hmm. You want a ride, it's now. ♪ Well, it's impossible to win ♪ An argument with you... Do you mind terribly if we... just turn this down? My head is killing me. Is that all right? - Sure. - Thank you. You know, it's not the music giving you a headache, it's your posture. What wrong with my posture? You stick your chin out like a prize fighter and it constricts your blood flow. Excuse me? You're tensing your labii inferioris. I bet you grind your teeth at night. You probably need a mouthguard. How would you know if I grind at night? Because I'm a DPT. What's a DPT? Doctor of Physical Therapy. Okay. You don't work at Tucker's? I start my new job at the VA next month, actually, and I am in charge of the whole ward. Congratulations. Am I going to get a bill for this diagnosis? Complimentary coffee, complimentary medical advice. Well, I appreciate that. Can you hold on one sec? Excuse me. Sure. Hey, Jillian. Hold on. Do you mind terribly if we just pull over really quickly? You... you want me to pull over? If you don't mind. Please. Yeah, hold on, hold on. Is it possible to have some privacy? Privacy? Yeah... uh... the person I'm talking to is... I don't know, uh... a celebrity. She's shooting a movie over in Hendersonville. I don't really know how it works with conversations and tabloids. Yeah, I'll... I'll give you some privacy. Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks. Can you hear me? Are you there? Hello? - Jill. I thought you'd be here by now! I know. I'm sorry. There was a delay with your birthday present. Oh! What is it? It's a surprise. I hate surprises. Just tell me. Everyone's dying for content of us together. Well, how about this... I'll give you a hint. It's your favorite color. Green isn't a hint! That's everything from cucumbers to emeralds! Your favorite color is blue. Color's not like a sports team, Luke, you don't need to be loyal to one your whole life! Ahem. Did you read the script? What's that? Check your email. I sent you a script. And guess what? It's a feature, Luke! It's a feature? Wow, okay. That's great! Me to star and you to direct! It's called "Island Girl." All the agents and execs are pushing for us to do it. I've got things to do, come on. I'm outta here. Hey, that's great. Hey! It's about a mile from here. You can walk. What? See ya! What are you doin'? Hey! Hey! Where ya goin'? I'm gonna call you back. Sorry, boys. Still haven't got that pyro switch in yet. I'm thinkin' fingers crossed for Saturday. Saturday? Look, I'm doin' the best I can, but these classic cars... Hard to find parts for. I'm thinkin' Wednesday the latest. What happened to Saturday? What about a tow? Classic car, Daniel. Tow a classic car... Wait, what about a flatbed? Vic Foster in Clarksville, he's got a flatbed. Great idea, Dan. But he's on the road. Terrible idea, Dan. Okay, so we're here for a couple of days. Just think of it as a vacation. Right, Sully? What's there to do around Lockhart? Hey, we got Tucker's Fall Festival coming up in two weeks. Did I just hear two weeks? But that's if we're waitin' for the flatbed. But I'm thinkin' that switch is gonna come in Wednesday/Thursday at the latest. I'll be in touch about the pyro switch. Still happy we stopped for Tucker's? Should have got her a diamond tennis bracelet. Oh, should I have? I said that, didn't I? Get her a diamond tennis bracelet. I don't know, Dan, did you? You've gotta learn to trust me, man. This the time? Okay, look, there's a donut shop, I think, let's go get a donut. I don't want a donut, Dan. My car. I understand. I'm going for a walk. Donut shop near me. Better. Thought you'd be gone by now. The car's not ready. That's too bad. Yes, it is. What's all that? Silent auction for the festival. It's a fundraiser for the VA. May I help you carry it? No, I got it, thanks. Okay. Well, at least your dog's a fan of me. Yeah, well, he chases squirrels. - Well... - I'm just saying. He goes for anything that walks. So you're saying you don't want to join my fan club. Are you recruiting? Seems like a bad sign. Look, I haven't been myself lately. I'm sorry if I was rude. If? Hold on, now, what about you? You left your guest stranded at the side of the road. That's bad manners. Sometimes, bad feels so good. What do you say we call it even? I'll think about it. All right. For the record, I don't hate all country music. I like Waylon Jennings. Liar. No, I'm telling the truth. Name one song. Okay, I can't name the song, but he recorded it with Willy Nelson, and the first line is something about a forgotten dream. "Good Hearted Woman." I'm impressed. Yeah, I don't know why that line's always stuck in my head. - I do. - Why? Because it's true to life. Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Excuse me. Do you got any Artemis action figures? Just that one over there. They go fast. Sold out of the lunch boxes the day they came in. Alright. Lunch boxes? T-shirts. hats, mugs. Don't hate me because I'm collectible. Artemis is collectible, not you. Yeah, that's a fair point. Although I think my name is somewhere on this box. There it is. Oh, yeah. Maybe if I had a magnifying glass. All right. I like this guy. It's my favorite. It's because he reminds me of Gort. Who's Gort? The robot? Klaatu barada nikto? You've never seen the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still"? I'm talking about the original, 1951. Before I was born. Okay, maybe, but this is a science-fiction classic, alright? Well, I was more into science fact. Like the knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. That kind of science. Here. For your auction. On me. So this Gort movie is a must-see science-fiction film? Yes. It is right up there with "Blade Runner." You've never? "Alien"? "Terminator"? You haven't seen any of these movies. Alright. I'm gonna make you a must-see list. Only if I can make you a "must hear" country music play list. A cultural exchange program. I like that. So you get klaatu barada nikto... And I get? "Blue Eyes Crying In the Rain." Do any of them have a happy ending? Come on, we can walk from here. Sure. Where are we going? The ridge. You want to understand country music, you've got to see a little country. Alright. Well... take a look. This is where the music starts. Wow. This is something. My Grandpa Tucker used to bring me out here when I was a kid. He let me march with him in the veteran's parade when I was little. That's when I knew I wanted to be in the army. Sounds like he had a big impact on you. You're lucky to have had someone like that in your life. He always said to me, "Now, remember, Callie, country music is three chords and the truth." I feel like I haven't taken a deep breath in a long time. It's just been back-to-back projects. It's nice to take a moment to clear my head. You never take time off? No, not with television, no. I'm thankful for the success, but... it can start to suck you in. You lose track of who you are. My Grandpa Tucker always said success can be your servant or your master. Tucker's got all the good lines, my goodness. He does. What's that? It's a notepad. I'm a filmmaker. You can't keep saying beautiful Southern things like that and expect me not to write it down. Well, it's a good thing my grandpa isn't here. You'd need a bigger notebook. Yeah, he's not wrong about the success, you know? But when you come from where I did, you have a tendency to want to hold on to the success very tight. Even when it feels wrong. Sometimes, you got to risk it to get the biscuit. You going to write that one down? I don't know. Maybe. Thank you. For the lift. Thanks for all your help. And... for donating your action figure to the silent auction. It's a big deal around here. Just know that if nobody bids on it, I'm gonna be crushed. Yeah, well, I think there are plenty of sci-fi nerds in Lockhart, rest assured. Good. I'll see you later? See you later. Bye, guys. Wait a second. I don't need to add Star Wars to the list, do I? May the force be with you. Good. There's hope for you yet. Glad to hear it. Any word on that pyro switch? Not since you asked me an hour ago. That's fair. Here, will you taste this? What am I tasting? I'm trying to recreate my grandpa's recipe. Okay. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, but you never had Grandpa's. Look, I know you want to honor your Granddad, but the fact that you're actually doing it... Trying... He'd appreciate that. He would. Or maybe he'd want you to walk your own path, no? Make your own sauce. - You know what? - What? You may be a lot smarter than you look, son. - I'll see you later. - See you, Sully. I don't know, if I just got a pat on the back or a punch to the nose. Take the pat on the back. He doesn't give those out very often! Hello there, everyone! Welcome to Callie's homecoming. We're so proud of you, baby. And to help celebrate, I'd like to offer pie and cider. They are on the house tonight! How about a song, Callie? Come on, Callie, sing us a song. Oh, and it looks like we have a request, so I think you will be singing for your supper after all, Callie. Come on up! You sing? In the shower, sometimes. And when I was little, I would occasionally jump on stage with my grandpa and my mom. Not anymore. They're not taking no for an answer. - I love you. - There you go. I am... beyond excited to be home. I missed all of you in this town so much. This is "Run."

I read it twice, actually. There are some ideas there that we need to discuss, for sure, but... Well, about that... I've already signed on. You'll be getting an offer. Three months together in Hawaii. It's hard to say no when you put it like that, but... Look, the first half is okay, I suppose, but... I went to bat for you, Luke.

Maybe you... you make your own. Risk it to get the biscuit. - Risk it to get the biscuit? - That's right. And, no. It's a Lockhart tradition... My grandpa's barbeque, and I have to get it right before the Fall Festival. You've been gone for a long time, right? Not everything's gonna be the same. Some things change. That's life. Some things never change. Name one. Well... how I feel about this town, and the people here, and my family, and the fact that we're always there for each other. That will never change. Sounds silly to you, doesn't it? No, actually, it sounds very nice. Just not sure I've ever had that. I'm sorry. I survived. It's okay. It's all right, it's all right. Are you okay? Uh-huh. Come here. Do you have a first-aid kit somewhere? - Under the sink. - Great. Give me your hand. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. This is going to be nice, but it's going to hurt a little bit at first. - Okay, okay, okay. - You ready? - Hoo. - You all right? Hold it there. Who catches barbeque sauce on fire? You do. I swore I get it right before the festival. And I swore that I would have an Academy Award by the time I was 30. Things... don't always go as planned, but that's all right. That's life. That's what makes it interesting. If you thought that I would be in a roadhouse diner at 2:00 in the morning wrapping a tiny, little hand in gauze, you would be wrong. I didn't know that. And it's interesting? Yeah, it is. I'm gonna tuck this in right here. How's that? - Well, I'd better... - Yeah, sure. Clean up. For what it's worth, some change is good change. Just saying. Oh, and if you do plan on burning down the kitchen, just let me know so I can drag Dan out. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. That right tire is balding. You got time, I can do it right now. Yeah, sure. Hey, how's Lynn? Uh... Honestly, we're taking a bit of a break. Mm-hmm. Yeah, a little bit more than a break. Mm-hmm. You know, when you were eight years old, you used to come in here and put two coins in that soda machine there, and then you'd stand there for about half an hour deciding which one... Orange or cola, cola or orange... And then once you picked cola, you wished you'd picked orange. Women aren't a can of soda, Joe. Come on, you can wait inside. Hey, man, do you know if Sully is here, by any chance? Yeah, he's just putting on a set of tires, he shouldn't be too long. Okay, good. I don't think we've met. Dr. Joe Wilkins. Luke Ellis. Nice to meet you. I know exactly who you are. I was there the day you hit Callie's truck. Hit? Yeah. Flying. There were a lot of adjectives thrown around about what I did that day. I would use "tap". I mean... must be a drag being stuck out here in Lockhart. Are you Callie's Joe? Yeah, you could say that. You know, in a way, it's kind of your fault that I'm here. If she wasn't so upset over you, then she probably would have seen me coming, you know? Who told you that? Callie did. You don't say. She's been really kind, showing me around. We've been spending some time together. It's been nice. - You and Callie? - Yeah. Yeah, she's been teaching me about country music. Barbeque sauce. The Cowboy Cha Cha. The Fall Festival. Oh, look, there she is now. If I'm being honest, it doesn't exactly seem like your sort of thing. Yeah, you're not wrong. There's something about her, though. That voice, my gosh. There's got to be a catch, though, right? I'm sure you've got your reasons. Silly as those might seem now. I mean, to someone like me, I just see someone who's beautiful. Charming. Lights up every room she walks into. Maybe that's just me. We did have some fun making barbecue sauce last night. - Excuse me. Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. There we go. Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Hey, George. - I'm good. Listen, I've been wanting to talk to you. About what? About us. - Us? - Yeah, you and me. The thing is, uh... Lynn and I are on a break. Maybe a little bit more than a break. Oh. I'm so sorry. Come on, George Jones. It's okay. Don't be. It was mutual. But I've been thinking a lot about us, Cal. You already said that. Have you? Have I...? Thought about us. I mean, of course, I have. Do you want to maybe... Maybe we could grab dinner? And catch up? Let me think about it. Okay. How's it going, Luke? You tell me, my friend. You find that switch? Not yet. Got one more store I got to check. Give me a minute. - Got nowhere else to be. - Alright. Need a hand? Yeah, actually. That would be great. Hi, George. How you doin', buddy? Thanks. So, hey, that was Joe. Wasn't it? You two are still in love, I can tell. Right, sweetheart? What makes you say that? Your body language. Mine or his? Both. It's a classic Hollywood moment, you know? Childhood sweethearts have a falling out, get engaged to the wrong people, and realize they're meant for each other. It's beautiful. - You're way off. - Am I, though? Hold on now, here's a guess. You've got a shoebox under your bed with every ticket stub and note he ever left you, am I right? I do not. You're a terrible liar. He just asked you out, didn't he? What did you say? Did you say yes? I said I would think about it. Okay. Maybe say yes. Maybe go somewhere rom
