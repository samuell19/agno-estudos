Hello, come on, come on. Get down there. You get your keys and hit it. They're getting away. Shoo, shoo! What you doing in there? I haven't got all day. Come on, get those keys in there. Come on, come on. Yeah, we got there. Come on, yeah. Yester, yes. I'm an inspector from the APEX Fine Cash Company. And I come here. I'm gonna inspect your little fortress here. You got enough bars on these windows to have a prison of your own, you know what I mean? Funniest thing I've ever seen. Give me the creeps. We got a lot of work to do here. This place is filthy enough to just stink out of pulp. Look at that. It gives the creeps, sir. You know what I mean? Really giving me the creeps. Where we go? We we go? I wanna see everything. I wanna see it top to bottom. Better get rid of all that junk down there. You're gonna lose your buyers. Son of a bitching keys. Let me get those for you. No, I'm not helpless. What do say about the mugger? Hey, Danny! Why won't you tell us one of those jokes? Okay. All right, I'll do the one about the whore and the sailor. - All right! - A whore. There's a sailor and he sees this whore. I told a joke. You didn't laugh. ♪ Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ♪ ♪ Praise him, all creatures here below ♪ ♪ Praise him above, ye heavenly host ♪ ♪ Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ Contemporary men differs little from his biblical ancestors.

Ira, a man supremely gifted by almighty god but he perverted his talents by making a mockery of justice, by making a game of lie. You hide this greed? He knows that Sinclair is lying and guilty! A gangster, a bum! Good afternoon, Mr. Pitts. I cannot speak for Mr. Sinclair or the judge. I have work to do. You tell Mr. Sinclair that he's going to hear from me personally. Come in. Queen's knight to queen five. Checkmate. You finally get rid of him? Mm-hm. Good. All right, what's on the calendar for today? Well, Hummer Beasley called again. He really wants you to write his will. He's quite sick, you know? I don't care how sick he is. I've already told him twice before I'm not interested. There's isn't enough money in Beasley's estate to make it worth my while. ls there anything else? Yes, Lucy's called. Forgot about her. Hi, baby. Listen, our date this weekend is off. Yeah, I've decided I'm definitely going with my school reunion. Ciao, baby. What are you doing? Let go of me. How y'all this evening? All right. Fine, how about you, girl? Fine, when do I get my raise? Play my song. Speak of the devil. I'll drink to that one. Hey, why don't we go home before you're useless for the rest of the evening? Your place? Mm-hm. This one. What? There is a big difference between uselessness and studliness. ls that a fact, hm? That's a fact. And I can guarantee satisfaction. Well, tonight at Buddy's Elbow Room, we have witnessed that light, lovely, luscious lady of the night, Ms. Lauren Larue and she's gonna dance for you! It's really. This is definitely a real party. Davis. What? Look at me, please. I'm looking. No, you're not. Look at me. Hey. What? Would you miss me if I went away for the weekend? No, no. I'm going to. Now that city was embodied by Enoch. And he was embodied by that city. Loaded in it's gluttony. Fat on its excesses. Thanks, hon. Hey, listen, can you take care of it for me? I didn't have a chance to get to the bank to cash and check. Sure. What are you doing out there, Luanne? Come in, keep me company. Well, we're not busy anyway. Ritchie will be here in a few minutes. We're going to zoo this afternoon. The zoo? Why go to the zoo for? The zoo is for animals, it's not for people. Listen, after my high school reunion, we'll go to my place and play a little Tarzan in the jungle. What do you say? Terry, I can't disappoint him again. So who's disappointing him? We'll all go the zoo later. Oh shit, here he comes. I just don't know what to tell him. Just go on, get him over here and I'll fix it. Little brat. Ritchie! Over here, hon. Hi, mom. Hi, hon. Mom wants you to wait here for a little while and I'll be right back. I won't be long. Hey, Ritchie! Hey, Ritchie, good buddy. Come on over here. Come on. It's a whole dollar. Now, you can go down to that monster film down at the V. Well, go ahead, take it. Jesus, aw! Ritchie! Ritchie, come back! Who mutilated the beast of the field and soiled nature. Pull. Am I going to the reunion, Jane? Jane, did you hear me? You're being such a bitch, you know? Did you seriously think I would take you with me, Philip? Well, I must tell you, I'm going to the Thompson wedding reception without you. Well, at least we won't need a babysitter. And just who's fault is that, Jane? Very good, Philip. Ernest. And then recall Lamech. Wise. Yet, Lamech was a wisdom without humility. He placed himself above others. He abused the light that god had granted him. Bloody hell, I look hideous. You're not. You look terrific. Oh, how can you say that? Just look at these circles under my eyes. I look positively liverish today. I need a vacation. Chance to get away from this life. What about those two weeks you spent in Cannes before we filmed again, Roger? Aha, there he is. Right on cue. Why don't you just stick to directing, Sam. I think having a conscience went out last year. Now don't be petulant. You need this rehearsal as much we do to set our camera angles. Just tell those bimbos to follow me. I'm the star. Follow you, Roger? You're all over the place. Now, you got to get some control of your body. Would you like to try it, Sam? Get on the set. I'm going to really enjoy myself of my high school reunion after putting up with all these nonsense. All quiet on the set. Places, everybody. Sound ready? Camera? What the hell is he doing? Roger! I'm leaving. Let them take heed at their peril. That no woman shall lie with another woman as she lies with a man. - Petra! Hi. I know. I know you changed your mind that I can't go with you, right? Petra, you look fresh as a buttercup. Thanks. It does me a hell a lot of good. I know how you feel. It'll be a long couple of days for you and me. Kirsten, you do not know how I feel. Petra. I'm sorry, I just don't understand why I can't go with you. It's just a silly reunion at my old school. It's no big thing. Yeah, but at this silly reunion, your friends are gonna have their husbands and their wives with them aren't they? Kirsten, are you ashamed of me? We have discussed this all before. I thought you understood what was the best for both of us. All right. Okay. What about the cat? Little Peter? Just for a while, he'll be Petra's Peter. Here's my key. You know where the food is. He's just a pussy cat, pussy cat. Okay, Kirsten, come on, let's save it, okay? Stop being so childish. You know how I feel about you. I'll miss you while I'm at the reunion. Hello there. Kirsten! John, it hasn't been that long. I'm glad to see you. I didn't think you'd be here. What are you doing now? Stand back, let me take a look at you. You look fantastic. So do you. He's gotta be somewhere, honey. We just have to look in the right places, that's all. Maybe he's at his friend's house. He ran away because he thought he hurt you with that door. Oh, he thought he hurt me, huh. Hey listen, you pick me up, okay? You get your own ride. I'm not doing anything until I find Ritchie. He's hurt. Bye, sweetie. Save some of your energy for me, hon. Hey, how are you? Ah, the joys of marriage. Hello, football hero. Hey, Terry. Johnny. Kirsten, don't tell me you two got married. Oh don't worry, I won't tell you. The kiss of death, dear. Yeah, you know it. Now, knowing Mr. Touchdown, I bet your wife is a super cook. Oh no, she's not my wife. Me and my wife are meat and potatoes. But down the road, it's strictly hamburger.

Good to see you. Roger. Kirsten. Cindy! Say, which one of you belongs to the classy Stingray. I'll bet this beauty owns that beast. Right, miss all around coed of 1967? Oh darling. I had a feeling it would give me away. So you married easy street, huh? Looks good on you. Well, if we're comparing notes, I'm single and to the best of my knowledge, no children. My turn. Don't laugh, all right? I've been married and then single and then married. I've got a divorce, I've had annulment. Now, I'm having lots of fun. Well, I'm single but I've got lots of irons in the fire. Ooh, you're always big man on campus, huh. Yeah, I bet they lost girl's jockstrap in chem lab too, don't we? You know, everything was another game. Oh, speak softly and carry your big stick. Right, John? Hey, what are we standing out here for? Let's go in. I've tried. The doors are locked. There's gotta be somebody inside. What is it? What do you mean what is it? I mean what do you want? We're having a class reunion here today. Oh yeah? Nobody called me about no reunion. Can we come in? Can we come in, please? Yeah, I guess so. You sure all about this reunion? Of course, we're sure. Look at the sign,. It's right in front of you. The fact is, young man, that I don't have my glasses with me. You mean nobody else has been here today? No, not through those doors, young man. Well, I guess I'll leave you all to your own little party. Better keep an eye on him. I think he's gonna go fall asleep. Leave him to his own devices. Hey, John. Let's go check out the trophy case. Jesus, will you look at that. What did they do with them?. Yeah, most of those are mine. Hey, wait a minute. Don't forget, I was the one who threw all those long passes that never got intercepted. Oh, come on. Most valuable player, City Conference, 1965, '66, '67. MVP of the Tri-state Conference, '66, '67. Now, where are they? Old Georgie Hanrahan probably hocked them when the bank closed down the school. They're probably sitting in some pawnshop somewhere collecting dust. Hey, come on, don't take it so hard. Hey, would you like to go the cafeteria and see everybody? Yeah, a little bit. I'm hungry. Come on. Oh Terry. Looking good. Look at that. Look out, look out. Where is everybody? Who cares? Easy, Terry-O. We don't have to beat any crowds. Hey, where the hell is everybody? Who cares? Let's eat. I don't think we have to beat any crowds. Hey where the hell is everybody? Please, sit down. Let's eat. Oh, it's terrific, Roger. Oh, thank you. Hey, don't be a piglet. You want one of these? That side over there. Try one. All of these? Great, great. It's terrible. Give me that one. I think so. Well, these chairs are set up. You know, I don't think I've ever had a supper like this in my entire life. They really pulled the stops out. The question is who's they? I don't know about the rest of you but I feel a little strange. I'm never early. Well I can phone Stanley Fuller. Maybe he's got some answers. Stanley Fuller? Stanley Fuller? Do you know, I received a Christmas card from him and his mother every Christmas. He does still live with his mother. The only card I get is in a woman's handwriting. I guess it's hers. Of course, it might be his wife. Not a chance on that. Now, that isn't nice. Okay, okay. Anyway, the operator can give me that. Would you like to come along? Yes. You know, better watch old John if he gets you back in the library. He knocked out a lot of rabbits behind those bookshelves. But I think I can handle any man. Just make the phone call, huh, people? I guess there's a logical explanation for only six of us showing up. Sweetheart, there's always a logical explanation for everything. I was right. Still looking for answers. You mean secrets. Cynic. I always sing for my supper. Nothing changes. Hello, operator. I'd like some information, please. I'd like the number of Mrs. Marshall Fuller. From Yews Drive in the town of Five Oaks Right. Operator? Operator? Hello? Yeah, that was terrific! Frankly, I don't give a damn if nobody shows up. We have a feast here. Able to adapt to any situation, huh, Terry? Huh? That's wonderful. Get him a water, will you? This really is pretty mysterious. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go over to Lynn Smith's house and see if she know and see if she knows what's happening, okay? Give me my napkin. Roger, wanna come with me? No, I'll think I'll pass up there. Can I have some, please? Wait your turn. There's plenty here. Don't worry about it. Oh, look, it got on my pants. My pants. Oh, what a darn thing. Very stupid. Hey. Why do that for? Hello! Hello? Hello. Hello? Hey, you know what you did? You locked the gate so I can't get out the door. Can you hear me? Look, all I wanna do is just to get out of here for a second, that's all. Hey, are you all right? Cindy, what's wrong? Cindy. What is it? What's the matter? Cindy, what's wrong? What happened? Cindy. Maggots. They got to him fast. I'd go near him if he wasn't dead for a while. He's been dead for a while. And who let us in before? Jesus. Wait. Fingerprints. We'll all go down to the police. Didn't you hear what I said? The doors are locked. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not being ridiculous. All the doors are locked. I'm trying to make a call before the lines went dead on me. We'll never gonna get out of here. I know it. There's got to be another way out. Hey, I don't remember they're having been bars on these windows before. It's too much time and too much effort for an idle joke. Come on, let's all go back. Help! We're locked in here! We need some help! Can you get a key? Can you hurry? I just got panicked. I just panicked. Here, here. Relax, okay? It's all right. Oh, this is insane. Yeah, just like some cheap paperback novel, huh. Untrue, darling. This was very costly. Undoubtedly some psycho. ls that music been on ever since we've got here? What, from the PA? Yeah, I guess it has. Well, somebody must be playing it. I think it comes from the audiovisual room. Come on, let's go check it out. Jesus, I can't get my hands shaking like that. Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey, what are we gonna do if there's somebody in there? Let's find out. Get the crowbar. Okay, let's move in low. I'll go first. Make one move and I'll gonna bust your head. You just put them hands up over your head where I can see them. Come on, man. We're not fucking around. All right, you son of a bitch! Oh no! Oh god! Revenge? What for? What else could it be? Well, what did I do? Oh, what did any of us do, Roger? Anything! Something we did on somebody back in school. Terry was always picking on people, remember? Don't talk about him now. Did something, but to who? I don't remember doing anything to anybody. I'm not as positive as you. Well, I don't care about any of you. But nobody began to hate me until I married a lot of money. Well don't you all see? It's all too perfect. There aren't any homes nearby. There's nobody around to see us or hear us. Look, does this building have an incinerator. Oh come on, let's just burn the whole building down and that'll bring somebody. Fire isn't a bad idea. We have to gather something to burn, right? Very well, I'll go and get some tablecloths in the cafeteria. Let's check out the classroom. Hello! Hello! I make it a rule never to talk to anyone with a gun in my hand. I think it's rude. Yes. Look I've got to get to a telephone. In the high school... High school. Hey, that place has been closed for years now. What are you doing up there? ls there a house nearby? I have to call the police. Well, there's a barn at the end of the path. Good. Hurry, my friends are in there. You get my gun for me, please? Do you know anything about guns? That'll do. Hold on for a second. I forgot something. I'll tell you something. People go after these decoys like them was a real thing. You know, I paint her myself. I call her Mildred. Hey, will you carry Mildred for me till we get up to barn ends? All right, I'll carry Mildred. But you think we could hurry it up a little. Yeah, sure, sure. Forgot about your friends. You know I got other interests besides hunting. ls it much further? You know, I enjoy reading Shakespeare. Especially his love sonnets. But that's the school! We should've stayed together. A shotgun. Oh where the hell that come from? How the hell should I know? Besides, what difference does it make? She's dead. I don't suppose you have any helpful ideas. You're always so goddamn smart back in school. If you panic, John, it will always set a bad example for all of us. Hey, look, I don't panic. Just maybe what you said before, Roger. Just maybe what you said. Just Well, you know, you always could antagonize the hell out of me. What difference does it make? We haven't started a fire yet. If that doesn't work, then we can panic. Let's just forget it. This isn't getting us anywhere. All right, let's start a fire. Okay, let's do it. Damn, it's too dark in here. Do you remember where the audiovisual room is? Of course, I do, yeah. I left the crowbar up there. All right, I'll be right back. No, no, it's all right. Oh, god. Oh, god. Look, it's Terry. He's burnt and sitting on the chair. He cuffed and microphone stuck in his mouth. He's burnt? My god! Kirsten, just concentrate on us. Now, Terry is dead. We're alive. Now, let's concentrate on getting outta here. Just put the crowbar in. Okay, one, two, three. What are we gonna do now? Let's get out of here. Let's go, come on. Let's go. We must be overlooking someway of getting outta here. There's a always a solution to every problem, right? Look, from now on, we'll just go everywhere together. What was that? ls somebody in there? Sounded like it came from the auditorium. Come on, lets go find out. Watch your step. Are you okay? Wait, wait. What's up in there? Here, why don't we go? You were probably wondering why I asked you here tonight. You are my earthly wards. It's time to rest these weary bones. Guilt! Guilt! A hard edged thing. Do you agree, my friend? It reeks one like a carrion's beak. Examine your soul. It's to blame for the body's evil ways. It's the soul that pays! Weep not. For he cannot be cheated. He will not be cheated. Oh, finally it comes! The Yoknapatawpha will have peace for the dagger changes hands. A better man that never live that could pronounce the Yoknapatawpha name! Cindy, you got to calm down. We got to think! You've been calm. You don't care do you? You don't mean that! I know we're not gonna get out of here. I know, we're not! We're not! You got to stop it! Just get away from me! I feel sick. Let's get out of here. Come on, wash your face. You'll feel better. Okay. Oh my god, what a mess. Feel better now? Yeah, I feel a little bit better. We're wet. It's all right. You're okay now? Look, we've got to find John. Okay. And the three of us, we get a way to get outta here. You've been so nice to me. Thank you very much. Let's go. All right. Oh, I forgot my bracelet. Cindy! Cindy! Get at the door! Unlock it! No. Cindy! Your make up, dear. Cindy, Cindy, Cindy! You serve others. Now, we're going to watch it go down the drain! Kirsten, help me! Get the door! Time has come to serve yourself. No. Somebody help me, please. No. Stay away from me. Oh dear god, help me, please. Please, please, please. Please, don't kill em. Get away. No, no! No! Let go of me! Let me go! Don't! Stop it! No, no, no! No! No! God, no! No! Down! Cindy? Who are you? I'm here to shake your hand. On the other hand, I think we could forego the self-serving amenities considering the circumstances. John, I'll be perfectly frank. As a criminal lawyer, you are a washout. You haven't the slightest knowledge of the criminal mind. Still, your job is to defend criminals, isn't it? Not to understand why they do the nasty things they're accused of. Understand me, though. The ideals that I stand for. We are quite the same. Kill four people in cold blood. You call yourself sane? I've killed five people. Frankly, I never felt better in my life. Your friend Cindy is down in the little girl's room. Sensible? Sensible. I like that, yes. I'll not redeem you before I have to. As I say, Cindy. She just washed her makeup off. How did it get this far? You try to reason with me. I resent it! I said we were sane. I am your fate and you cannot deny me. Then tell me why. Why did you do it? Why? Do you serve others or just yourself? I just stand and wait for sinners. You pride yourself in being counsel to the wicked. Everybody's entitled to earn a living. Oh, you. Your appetite are just like the others. They're too big for you to go on without being punished. Why don't you just tell me why. Why, for god's sakes? I'll tell you why. The sins against people. I don't understand. What other people? What sins? I'll tell you what sins, John. I'll tell you. For gluttony in all things. For vanity, horniness, for perversions, for licentiousness, for debauchery. For now you, John. Now you for avarice. Oh yes, yes. You must made to make redemption for your greed. Look, I'm a good attorney. Maybe we can work this out today! John. John. John. Take off my wig, John and see as I really am. Gluttony. Vanity. Perversion. Licentiousness. Debauchery. John, are you out there? Kirsten, you mustn't make me chase you. I could die of a heart attack. Harken unto me. Those who have sinned have met with the angel of the lord's vengeance. They have been delivered from the bondage of sin and have the penalties of violating his laws. They have met the angel of redemption. Now, we may walk in peace, my children. Go in peace. With the knowledge that we have been redeemed. Thank you for the flowers. They were lovely additions. How's your daughter doing? So inspiring. We remember it too. As usual. Thank you. Your welcome. Very inspiring message, thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. You take care. Thank you. Good day. How are you doing now? Fancier, thank you. Okay, good. - See you next week. - See you next Sunday, Yeah. See you next week. See you next week. Don't worry. Everything is going to be all right now. I know, Christopher. I know.
