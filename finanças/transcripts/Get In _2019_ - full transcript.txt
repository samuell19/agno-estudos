NETFLIX PRESENTS THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE BASED ON A TRUE STORY. OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE VICTIMS, THE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. AUGUST 30TH You've reached Sabrina's voicemail. Leave a message. Maybe her battery's dead. Try Eric. I don't have his number. - Got the remote? - Yes, in my bag. Forget it. I'll try the landline. This is Eric and Sabrina Bolso. What's up? This is Eric and Sabrina Bolso. What? Leave a message. Hi, Sabrina. It's us. The remote to the gate isn't working. You're not answering your phone. What's going on? Can you call us back? Urgently, please. A light just went on. Keep trying. This is Eric and Sabrina Bolso. This is Eric and Sabrina Bolso. - This is Eric... - Hey, we're here! You've reached Sabrina's voicemail. You've reached Sabrina's voicemail. This is Eric and Sabrina Bolso. Leave a message, we'll call you back. Shit! Sabrina! Eric! Evening. Evening. Did you call us? No, but we can't get into our home. Evening! Why can't we go home? We will soon, honey. Sit there. Take your hood off. Let me explain. It's a misunderstanding. Don't move. What the hell? - On your knees! - It's my house. Look, this is ridiculous. - Mom! - He's my husband. Get down! It's my home! Get down. What's going on, Mom? - It's private property. - I just want to go in my house. - Did you call us? - Yes. - Do you live here? - Yes. - It's my house. - Shut up! Look at the mailbox! It says Paul and Chloé Diallo! D-I-A-L-L-O! It says "Bolso." This is a joke! Why are you here? Leave him alone! I've just driven 500 miles, I'm exhausted! My son's in the back of that van, I want to get into my own house! Shut up and you won't get hurt. You better shut up. Fucking hell! Come on! - Daddy! - It'll be okay, honey. Get up! Move it! - Your men used excessive force. - It was a break-in. Was it special treatment for blacks? The Bolsos say you rented the house to them. We lent it! Sabrina has been our son's childminder for two years. They'd been evicted. We were going away for two months, we let them stay in our house to tide them over. Did you sign this? We asked them to pay the utility bills while we were away. I understand. But we can't evict them. That's insane! It's our house! They're in their home. This paper says so. But where will we go? Let me get this clear. They can live in our house and we can't? Not without a court order to evict them. Let's go. Come on, hon. I'm warning you, don't force your way in. You'd be facing a three-year prison sentence. We're going back home to talk to them. Are you sure? There she is. Sabrina, can we talk? How can you do this to us? We helped you when you were evicted. We're homeless. You okay with that? No comment. The boy loves you. Tell him why he can't be in his room. No comment. This is our home. - We signed a contract. - What contract? - Eric! - You're crazy! Enough of this crap. Get your stuff and get out of our home! We won't press charges. This is our home. Go or I'll call the police, okay? I'll call the police. Go inside. Go on. Aren't you ashamed? Be reasonable, just go. Or what? Will you protest, go on hunger strike? Huh? Come on. Mail. WILL-O'-THE-WISP CAMPSITE Classy chassis. Chloé! How about that? Hi. How you been? Long time, no see. Paul, my husband. Mickael. Everyone calls me Mickey. We were at school together. On vacation? Not really. Okay, well, um... The sanitation block is over there. Ask if you need anything. It's 20 euros a night. Pay when you leave. Take your pick. The place is almost empty now. - Were you friends? - No, we were at the same school. Well, he hasn't forgotten you. This is crazy! You change the name if someone asks you to? What about the bills? Thanks a bunch! They've paid the utility bills. They're the perfect tenants! Don't worry. I've filed an interim possession order. We'll fast-track the procedure and get your house back ASAP. How soon is "ASAP"? In five days' time. Just to be sure... - Could we lose? - No. They have no right to be there. What about that paper we signed? The police said it was legally binding. They can't be evicted on the spot, that's all. You'll get your home back very soon. ♪ Just me and you ♪ SEPTEMBER 5TH ♪ Parked by the B ♪ ♪ To copulate in ease ♪ ♪ To copulate in ease ♪ ♪ You know me ♪ ♪ You know I ♪ ♪ Can never justify ♪ ♪ That all I have is age ♪ ♪ That all I have is age... ♪ Louis, put that gun down and come get dressed. Put it down. Come on, we'll be late. - Who gave it to him? - I found it by the lake. Come here. We're gonna be late. You haven't touched your breakfast. That's not good. You're old enough to dress yourself. - Don't take that to school. - Why? - It's against the rules. - It sucks. I'll go get the car. - Give me that. - Your schoolbag! I'll be right there. We're seeing the shrink at 5:00. Don't forget. - Have I ever let you down? - Very funny! Chloé, it's my birthday... Be on time. Off we go! To start the year, I want to discuss natural rights. Does anyone know what John Locke called "natural rights"? Nobody? Sheridan? What can no one take from you? His ugly face! Calm down. Kevin! You want to talk. What can no one take from you? My life. What was abolished in the late 19th century in America? Slavery? So, what is slavery? Depriving someone's freedom to make them work. Exactly. Freedom. Kevin, your phone. - I ain't done nothing! - Why not give it to me? - It's mine. - Did you buy it? What with? - Your money? - My mom's. But it's still mine. According to Locke, you're right to want to keep it. It's your property. That's the third natural right. Life, liberty, property. And who guarantees these three rights? - The police! - What? - The law? - Exactly. People got fed up with having to fight to survive, so they decided to let society do the job. - Hey. - So, we traded our liberty for safety. - Kevin! - Yeah? Share it with the class. If I tell you, you won't kick me out? We're listening. If you get robbed, it's 'cause you're weak. That's the bottom line. If the guy knows you'll beat him up, he won't try to steal your stuff. But you gotta be a real man, not a big fag. - Right? - Right. Get out. You're a liar! He's right. Are you a racist? What did you say? Everyone knows you're an Oreo! Open your books to page 96. Shit! - Surprise! - Happy birthday! Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Dad! Hey, honey. There's no doubt about it. How long? - The day after tomorrow. - What a crazy situation! It's an extended vacation. Louis is thrilled. He's telling his friends we're cavemen! He loves pissing outside! How's your new job? Are you pleased? Yes, the managers are great. We're setting up partnerships with other music schools in France and Europe, too. Sounds great. So, I'll be traveling this year to visit my opposite numbers around Europe. - You didn't tell me. - You didn't ask. So, your vacation was great? It took me back to my childhood. My dad took us all over Europe in that. I thought, when I'm grown up, I'd take my family. Well, I thought I'd have a threesome! That explains why you never grew up! I love this song! Me too. ♪ I wasn't breaking any rules ♪ ♪ There just wasn't the time... ♪ We'll be going. - Thanks a lot. - It was great, as usual. - Happy birthday again. - Thanks.

I'll go next time. I'm not in the mood. "Happy birthday, Paul!" Happy birthday, Paul. SEPTEMBER 15TH I've given your case full consideration. I am unfit to rule on it. This signed agreement is open to interpretation. It can't be. Occupancy is subject to this agreement and does not constitute a manifest tort. A case could also be made about the legality of the contract between the two parties. Then, there is the fact that the occupants maintain the property. What was that? We were supposed to get our house back today! I didn't think the judge would be so zealous. With that contract, if they pay the utility bills, they're legal tenants. The high court must make a ruling. How long will that take? I can't say. Will you do something? We'll get your house back, I assure you. I'm sorry, it's just a hitch. You're fucking us around. - Please, keep us posted. - Of course. - What's it about? - A housing issue. - Any children? - Yes. You need to see the Departmental Office for Solidarity and Insertion. There you are. Goodbye, sir. I want to see the mayor. - See the DOSI, sir. Thanks, goodbye. - Thanks. I need a rent receipt. It's for a couple who live in my house. If they're elderly, you need to see the Local Social Action Center. No, they're young. Are they minors? No, they're our childminder and her husband. - Do they have children? - No. In that case, the RIC can advise you. Reception and Information Center. Their office is at City Hall. I need a proof of residence. It's in the house. So, ask for a duplicate utility bill. It's not for me. Do you have a power of attorney to lodge a request? They don't know I'm requesting it. I can't register a housing request by a person who isn't here. You're as thick as pig shit. - Pardon? - They're squatters! I pay the mortgage, insurance, tax! Should my son sleep in a tent? I must ask you to leave. - Calm down, bro. - What? Come along with me. Whatever. I won't tell a soul. I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I did that. I know why. Come here. - Thanks. - Take a seat. Have you worked here long? I've always lived locally. This ain't a bad job. It gives me free time. I started with my wife. And? She left. She cheated on me. I told her to go. And you? What about me? What do you do? I teach history. I love history. What would you say was the worst year in human history? Big question. Seventy-two thousand years ago maybe. A volcano on Sumatra blew up. It was like 2 million Hiroshimas. The human race was almost completely exterminated. There were only 10,000 people left. The survivors. The ancestors of us all. That's why we humans are all so close genetically. Even you and me? Even you and me. Historians always present human history as ongoing progress. Agriculture, culture, science, technology, the empires, human rights... But are we happier now than in the days of hunter-gatherers? They didn't live as long. More people die of suicide than are killed. Humans live shitty lives for longer. So, spit it out. Spit what out? Your troubles. Why are you here? Not with your wife? Hmm? I'm interested, honest. My telly's busted. And I love a good story. Mom? Yes, I'm coming. What's wrong, honey? Why won't Sabrina give us our house back? I don't know. I suppose it's because she doesn't have her own home. You sleep now. So, what's the plan? My lawyer says, do nothing. The judge is examining the case. Meanwhile, I'm stuck. I've got no choice. If you say so. Not "if I say so." It's a fact. It looks more like a choice. If you've got advice, shoot. Forget it. It's none of my business. You could at least say what you think. Want to know what I think? You're a victim 'cause you've decided to be one. You asked me. I told you. Here. For your son. OCTOBER 2ND If a date has been set, that's good news. Yes and no. - It's November 9th, after... - ...the winter ban on evictions. I did all I could. This isn't happening. Look, if the council rehouses them, you can get your home back. I think this is your best chance right now... She's crap. She's stupid. She's got nothing to offer except her contrite look. She'll go back to her cozy little house and get screwed by her husband. Do you see what'll happen? We can't afford to rent a place or go to a hotel! We'll pay the mortgage for two squatters while we live in a van! Whichever way you look at it, that's how it is. We could stay at Denis's. He's offered several times. - Did you touch her? - What's your problem, dickhead? Wanna fight? Calm down! That's enough! - I'm not scared! - Neither am I. Fuck! Calm down, now. It's over. That's the guy. Yeah? Just a sec. Paul, come here. How about a guys' night out? Come on, I know you want to! Get in. Hang on. In you get. Don't worry about that. Careful. You a teacher? - You're the teacher? - Yeah. Oh, yeah? Hi, I'm Franck. - Paul. - Okay, Paul? Like selfies, Paul? Let's do one. Come on! Don't look so gloomy. Give me a smile! Smile, be happy! Here we go. Here. Come here. Look after the barbecue. Do you like it? Huh? Have some fun. SUBSCRIBE! Like my tutorials? Drink up. Here, Mom, the last shot's for you. I love you, Mom. Cheers. Hey, teacher! Special tune for you, bro! Come on, guys. So, you're the guy who has nowhere to live? Huh? I can help you. Hey, teacher, listen! Let me tell you something. You could get your house back at gunpoint. But if you shoot some guy trying to rob you, you go to jail! Look at me. It's not their house. Listen, it's your house. Say it. Say it's your house. - It's my house. - It's your house! Think those squatters are worried? Huh? They took your house. They must have big fucking balls. Your turn, teacher! Go on, teacher. Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Go on, do it! Move it! Move it! You did it! Let's see if you've got anything left. It ain't over yet. Guys! Light it up. They're here! They're coming. Let's do this! Wanna shoot? Come on, Paul. I know you can do it. Shoot! Finish him off. This was Franck's dad's place. When it went bust, the pigs overran the place. He just let them. I understand him. You think things will sort themselves out. - Bye, my little piggies! - Bye. What do I owe you for the pitch? Forget it. I don't charge my friends. - You're hurt. - Get in. We're going. - What's going on, Dad? - Go back to bed. Back to bed, honey. Okay, hon? Are we going back home? Now what? A student called me an Oreo. What does that mean? Black outside, white inside. He's right. What are you talking about? Paul. Get back in your van and go. Know what? You can't evict us unless the owner obtains a court order. I'm the owner. Louis! Louis! Come back. Louis! - Don't come in. - Let me get my son! Stop it! Eric. Louis thought we were going home. Can I fetch him? I want my bird. It's staying. Here, hon. Aren't you seeing your new pal? No harm in broadening one's horizons now and then. What do you talk about? We had a few drinks with some friends of his. Were the women cute? Not bad. Paul, you must ease up. We can't do anything, so accept it. Concentrate on what matters: our family. We'll get the house back. But don't get so worked up. Listen... Let me ask Sophie to put us up. Just for a few days, while we calm down and relax. You don't get it. I'm not going. Or back to school. I'm on sick leave for two weeks. I won't leave. Sorry. Bye, ma'am. Drive safely, honeybun. What are you up to? Want a drink? What are you playing at? I didn't ask you to stay here. I wouldn't have come if I'd known. I had no wish to see you again. So, why are you here? Leave my husband alone. Now is not the time to put ideas in his head. What kind of ideas? Don't act stupid. I know you've been together. I doubt if it's meditation. Paul is fragile. Not really. He's turned into a good doggy for his good little wifey to fit into his clean world. The wolf in him has been tamed. That's what's hurting him. Not me. Is that the crap you tell him? Don't see him again. Leave us alone. Is that clear? You, too, would like him to be rougher. More brutal. You won't admit it. You still have the fire within. You jerk. Get off! You didn't tell him about us? Hm? Get off me! Get off me, please. OCTOBER 25TH Know how long it lasted? Twelve years, lots of money, three lawyers. They thought they'd be back home in a matter of days. If the state can't help us or our families, if we want to fix a problem, we'll have to do it ourselves. Society's gone to shit. So, you and Chloé were friends? We were at school together. How did you find out she cheated? Wait, let me guess. You found incriminating texts? How do you know? You're predictable. You have qualities, but that's a fault. Did you leave her? No. I was going to, but I love her. I love my family. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I didn't want to walk out. It would've been a cop-out. You thought starting a new life would make things better? Know what I think? You were scared to leave her. You chose to play the victim again. You need to see what you're made of before playing the Dalai Lama. Don't avoid fear. Savor it, embrace it. Your pals are here. Your story moves us. There's a line of people around you. Everyone will help you. Trust me. No, you're not doing what I said. I told you, you just look like a sulky baby. - I'm hungry. - I need a decent photo first. It'll take as long as necessary. - Where's Mom? - Just think of sad things. I can't! Mom is sick of you. She can't stand you. - It's not true! - It is! I'm sick of you, too. Do it! Help Louis! This man has nowhere to turn to! Ladies and gentlemen... This man has no one to help him! Neither the council nor the law will answer his call! We can't turn our backs on him! Solidarity! Solidarity with the immigrants... Wacko. Solidarity with the immigrants! - I'm not an immigrant. - It works better nowadays, you'll see. Solidarity with the immigrants! OCTOBER 31ST What the fuck? - Get off! - Shut up! - Damn it! - Move! Move it! Eric! Eric! What's that? Huh? Did you and your pals do that? Where are they? Huh? Where? What do you think? The whole town knows. The whole region. Everyone hates you. Tell them to come! I ain't scared! - Leave him alone! - Stay away! It'll never stop, understand? Look after your wife and kid and beat it! Sabrina? Leave me alone. - I'll take you to the hospital. - No. It's okay. I'll take you. Paul. You're going too far. What? Chill. Your new pals. You know Mickey went to jail for beating up his ex? Where's your compassion? Let me give you some advice. If you want to keep your wife and job, pull yourself together. HELP HIM GO HOME It's the truth about our situation. It'll lead to a lynching! How dare you, you asshole. Who do you think you are? Aren't I a good-enough black? I did everything right. Good job, white wife, homeowner, taxpayer... I was kicked out by whites. They stole the house that belonged to my dad. I'm out on my ass! And I should keep my mouth shut and be happy? Beat it before I punch you! Where's Louis? - I'll be in the car. - We're staying at Sophie's. The flyer was the only way. By exhibiting our son? Traumatizing him? You're crazy! I want to get away from here and forget this house. When it gets tough, you run away. I should have when you cheated on me. What's the connection? You have a classic midlife crisis and get laid for six months, neglecting your family and lying all day long. When it's over, you want things to go back to normal? It doesn't work like that! I thought it could, but it can't. There are consequences. So, you're with me or against me. It's all over, except in your head! Look at yourself, damn it! You play the cowboy, one foot in, one foot out, like with me! What do you actually do apart from talk, huh? Nothing! Out of my way. I'll settle this tonight! - I didn't think you'd show up. - Well, I did. Go away or you're gonna get it. Scram. You son of a bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up good! Kick him in the balls! Not so big now? I told you to back off. Hey! Been giving Dracula's bride a good fuck? What's going on? Mr. Diallo, please help us! Mr. Diallo! Ah! One of teacher's students! Huh? Mickey, let them go! Mickey! Whoa... Take it easy. Stay out of this. It's okay, everything's fine. It's all okay. Chill. - There he is. - Honk your horn. Hey! Where are you going, teacher? Oh! Get in. What are you doing? Is it 'cause of that girl just now? Hey! Hey, teacher, we'll get your house back. Hey, have you forgotten what day it is? October 31st. - It's now or never. - What'll you do? I'll keep my promise. Tonight you sleep in your own bed. Hey, what's wrong?! Screw you, Mickey! Drive. Stop the car. Come on. Dance with the devil in the moonlight. Your crap doesn't work anymore. You won't get your wife back. Don't talk about her. You know she came to see me? Oh. Didn't she tell you how he banged her at school? Huh? Oh! She didn't want to hurt you. - She can't stop getting it on the side. - Shut up! You're not the man she needs. You've got no balls. Hm? Huh? I thought you had it in you to change. Huh? But they've domesticated you. You'll never change back now. Keep away from me, my wife and my house. Shame. I thought it was the start of a beautiful friendship. Okay, Franck, let's go! So long! Hello. You've reached Chloé Diallo. Leave a message. I'll phone the lawyer about custody of Louis. I won't fight. Did Mickey do that to you? Why didn't you say you'd slept together? It meant nothing. It was ages ago, I was just a kid. What did that message mean? You were right. If I want my house back, I take it. If I want my wife back, I take her. But I'm not like that. I never will be. I know I was very selfish. I hurt you. But you don't realize how lucky we are. You're the one I want. Your virility problems are in your head. I want to grow old and build my life with you. I love you. It's them. Stay inside. Sabrina! Eric! Open up! - What's going on? - Go upstairs. Go on, damn it. Let's torch it, guys! Sabrina! Eric! Let me in! Let me in! Open up! Hurry! Why are you here? What do you want? Your house. I had your wife. Now I'll take your house. As you can't do it yourself, I've come to even up the cosmic score! Cut the crap, Mickey. That's enough! You've done your show. Now clear off! The thing is, I'm a bit bored of the old campsite. So, I'll throw them out. From now on, this is my place! And you'll be in a tent, pal! No, no, no. Eric! Can't we talk? Hm? Eric! Leave him alone! No! Eric! Don't avoid fear. Embrace it. Savor it. Eric! No. No! I'll handle this! Come here! Chloé. Chloé. Chloé. Chloé. It's party time, pals! Hang on.
