I don't know what just happened. I don't know what happened. She... Marie, are you breathing? You have to go faster. -I'm going as fast as I can. -Go! She stopped breathing! Please keep breathing.

Some ice? [Sighs, clears throat] Amy, when are you headed back? Uh, I'm going tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's spring break. Why don't you stay for the week? I, I have stuff I need to catch up on. So, yeah, well, probably tomorrow. Sit. Well, I'm gonna be late. -For what? -The party. Well, mom said I could go, like, two weeks ago. This was something you didn't wanna discuss with me? I was going to, but I... I don't see what the big deal is. It's just a party. The big deal is your attitude. Sit! [Sighs] Mom. Listen to your father. Are you kidding me? You said I could go. -I, I can take her. -Amy, stay out of it. You're not going. That's final. Go to your room. Okay. [Clears throat] Who wants dessert? [Chris] Heh. There she is. Let's get out of here. What, you catch hell? [Sighs] Yeah, but I threw it right back. -Right on. -[Engine starts] [Engine revving] [Knocking on door] Sarah? [Sighs] Come on, babe. I know you're mad.

He can be, you know, a little, uh, iffy sometimes. Hey, I'm going to the store. Where's your father? Uh, I think he's out front. Ah. Good for him. I worry about him. He's in the man cave so much lately. What do you think he does down there all the time? -You should go look. -No. He says there's rats. I am very not interested in rats. -Wanna come with me? -Mom, I'm on the phone. Oh. Is that Chris? Okay. Love you. I'm sorry. -[Irene] Bye, honey. -Buh-bye. [Engine revving] [Laughs] Yeah. Just... -Hey. Hang up the phone. -Oh. I need your help with something. [Sighs] I'm sorry, Chris. I have to call you right back. -Come on. -What do you want? -Huh? -Pick this up. Come on. Up. Yeah. We're going down the basement. That's right. Keep going. [Don] Watch your step. Uh, can I go hang out with a friend tonight? Well, you asked nicely, yes. -Here? -[Don] No. -[Exhales sharply] -Uh... [Intense music] [Sarah] What is this place? Previous owner built a bomb shelter. I made some improvements. Well, put that end over there. And here we go. What do you think? [Sarah] I mean, it kinda sucks. There is no windows. You don't like it? -Dad. -That's too bad. What are you doing, dad? Dad, what are you d... [Door shuts] Dad! Dad! Let me out! [Inaudible] Help! Oh. Oh. [Breathing heavily] What is this? What is my bag doing here? Hello! Help! [Breathing heavily] [Beeping] Uh... wait... [Beeping] Wait. Oh, oh. Why? Oh, god, no. Please, god.

[Amy] Mom, I'm sure she's fine. She's probably just at a friend's house. What friend? I called all her friends, nobody's seen her. -I'm calling the cops. -Reenie. Let's just go to sleep. She'll be here when we wake up. I'm calling the cops. Amy, call Chris.

Yeah, you can scream as much as you'd like, 'cause the room is soundproof. [Grunting] Dad, get off! Dad, let go! Let go! [Grunts] Ah! You can't do this to me. Yes, I can. I can't breathe. There's no air. As long as there's power, there's air. Three failed attempts on the keypad shuts the power off, which shuts off the ventilation system. I change the code every day. [Panting] Why are you doing this? Life is a series of interactions. Action, reaction. Choices, consequences. You chose to be disrespectful, and this is your consequence. Help! Someone! Ugh. This vent is where you get your air if I say you do. You eat when I say you do. You want a blanket, a book, you can have those things if I say you can. Everything that you get now, every privilege, you will earn. You understand? Do you understand? Fine. Ah. Damn. Huh? Hey! Ow. Ow. Oh, ow. [Groaning] Dad. No. -[Don grunting] -[Sarah groaning] [Sarah sobbing] [Intense music] [Instrumental music] [Beeping] [Door opens] [Door shuts] Well, it's not like her. I mean, she still hasn't called. She promised that she wouldn't run off like that again. She broke a lot of promises. This is my husband, Don. -Nice to meet you. -Sir. Well, she's run off before, right? [Don] Yes. [Irene] No. It was to a party. This is different. She came right back. Well, she's 18, which means she can come and go as she pleases. Isn't it likely that she decided she needed some space and is staying with friends? She doesn't have that many friends. I've talked to all the ones that I know. -Boyfriend? -Chris hasn't seen her. [Amy] And he seems like a pretty nice guy. Chris who? You got a number? Yeah. I'll go get it. All right. We'll talk to him. Did you guys notice anything missing? Clothes, personal items? Uh, yes. Some clothes and a travel bag. -Did you tell him her plans? -What plan? She wants to visit all 50 states. Don, it's not really a plan. She's a dreamer. And she said that when she turned 18, that she was gonna go from Florida and work her way across the country. But she hasn't had her birthday yet. [Sobbing] And she wouldn't leave without saying goodbye to me. She wouldn't. We've already filed a missing person's report. But without any leads, that's about all I can do at this point. And I've been doing this for 20 years. Usually, these situations resolve themselves. You'll be sitting at home, your phone will ring... And it'll be Sarah. Yeah. Well, thank you. [Don] And I'll be sure to let you know if she calls. -[Cop] All right. It's good. -[Door opens] Help! Help! [Grunting] [Panting] [Sarah] What are you thinking about? [Chris] Thinking about you. On the back of my bike. Hot. [Scoffs] Not if I fall off and die. Ah, you're safer on a bike than you are in a car. Oh, really? Well, uh, probably not. -But I'm gonna get you a helmet. -Mm. And then what? Then we're gonna hit the road. Me and you, rockin' your helmet. Yeah. Me rockin' my pink helmet. And, uh, where are we gonna go? Anywhere. Everywhere. Wherever you want. Florida?

Nice ride. Uh, look, is Sarah back? The cop, cops called me looking for her. I-I wanted to come by, see if you heard anything. Just wanted to, I wanted to bring her this. Um, she didn't tell you? Tell me what? She didn't say anything about Steve? S-Steve? Steve who? [Sighs] Sarah and Steve were best friends in the old neighborhood since, like, first grade. She always said that she was gonna run away with him one day, and right after graduation, she did. Wait, so you're, you're, you're trying to tell me that Sarah ran off with some guy named Steve? My wife said they're in Florida. She was working as a waitress. Now, you're sure she didn't say anything about Steve? I remember she, uh, she-she mentioned Florida. Uh, if you want, um, my wife can mail her the, the gift. -No, no. It's fine. Thanks. -Hey, Chris, I'm really sorry. I mean, you seem like a good guy. I... I'll tell her, you know, when she calls, uh, that, that you came by. Okay? Yeah, cool. [Engine starts] [Engine revving] Who was that? Any news?

It's a little early for that. Pick something else. Well, a TV? Mm-hmm, you're gonna have to earn that. -A clock? -Hm. Time passes really weird down here. Yes. I can do that for you.

[Device beeps] -Congrats on the promotion, dad. -Thank you very much, Amy. So, does this promotion come with a raise? I-I was thinking maybe we could hire a private investigator. -No. -Why not? You've already gone to Florida, you spent $5000, we're not gonna waste anymore money on this. Don't you wonder what happened to her? Don't you wonder if, if she's happy? [Irene] Maybe she's dead. I'm never giving up, Don. I'm gonna keep searching for her and I don't care what kind of money it costs. [Cutlery clattering] We have a daughter right here. [Door opens] [Sniffles] Merry Christmas.

You handle it. -Hey. -How you doing, big guy? Hey! Hey, she needs a doctor! [Sighs] [Sobbing] I'm sorry, sweetie. Can you tell me a story? Another one? -And I want a new story. -Okay. Um... Once upon a time there was a fairy Princess. And she was in love with a handsome prince. What was his name? His name was good prince Christopher. And he played the lute. And one day the Princess's evil father found out about prince Christopher and he was so mad that he chopped off his daughter's wings and he locked her in a cave underground. And the Princess was so lonely. But, but then one day, her fairy godmother came and brought her a little girl to keep her company. And they were so happy that she came back a couple of years later, but this time she brought them a little boy. What about good prince Christopher? I think he's still looking for her. And sometimes he sings the song he made for her hoping that she can hear him. -Do you know the song? -Mm-hmm. ♪ Wherever I go ♪ ♪ your voice echoes so loud ♪ [Humming] [Birds chirping] [Amy] Bye.

But I wanna go to the real zoo, stupid! Hey. Quiet chair, now! [Groans] [Chris] I knew he was lying. He was just making stuff up. I knew it. But he was really nice about it. That's my dad. He fools people. Yeah. Everyone, except the people who know him best. And Sarah, she saw right through him. She'd stand up to him. Well, what do you think happened? Most of the time I think she got away and that she's living a great life somewhere. And, you know, well, at other times, I just... I, I think he did something to her. -Like, what? -I don't know. Like... Maybe he hit her and she fell and... Gosh, I don't know. He hit my mom once, she was in the hospital for two days. -Jesus. -Yeah. You don't know the half of it. God, I miss her. [Sniffles] Maybe we can kind of go outside. I think I might need a little bit of an adventure. -What do you say? Michael. -Yeah. Come here, come on, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

What difference does it make what I say to some lowlife who's sneaking around with our daughter? -So you did lie! -You know something. Yeah, I know that your sister has been threatening to run away since she was 11 years old! -I-I wonder why, dad! -[Don] What does that mean? -Did-did you do something? -Did I do what? -[Irene] Amy, stop. Okay, Don... -I don't know. Did you, dad? All I did was provide for you and your sister! Both of you stop it, stop it! I am gonna hire a private investigator. What did I say about this? What you always say. You know what? I don't care anymore. I am gonna find her myself! You don't have to pay for it, you don't have to worry about it, I will get a job and I will find her myself.

You're just gonna... Abandon one of your children? And I'm done raising kids. What about reenie? There's not enough room down here for two kids. Definitely not three.

I hope you'll take good care of him for me until I can come for him. I love you and miss you. Sarah. -Come here, my baby. -[Baby bawling] -[Dramatic music] -Don... Don, Don... This is Sarah's baby.

"Mom, I'm being held captive in the basement. Call the police." You haven't learned a thing. Now put this on. [Clock ticking] [Marie] Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a dark cave with her mother, who was once a fairy Princess. One day a fairy godmother brought a little boy for the little girl to play with. They loved playing together. They went on amazing adventures, to the rainforest, the jungle and even the moon, where they met an alien. Even though they argued sometimes, they were very happy. Her mother's prince charming was still wandering, trying to find his fairy Princess. He sang the special song he wrote for her, and never gave up. The little girl never gave up either. She knew that one day she and her mother and her brother would be rescued... [Marie] ...And live happily ever after. -[Sarah] Wow! -[Cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Ah. Stop. Stay still. Let me see. Okay, you're done. Well, looks cool. -Yeah? -Yeah. [Indistinct chatter] -Ta-da! -[Michael] Really? [Laughs] You look like a clown. -Yeah, says you. -Hey, what are you doing? -Make-up. -[Sarah] No. You're not wearing make-up. Come here. You are very, very beautiful. Marie. Marie, come here. Come here. Hey! Come here, set the table. Michael, help your sister. You don't touch her. Please leave her alone. Take this with you. She doesn't need it. She's just a kid. -[Beeping] -[Door opens] [Door shuts] [Marie] Great. Thanks, mom. -[Breathing heavily] -Hey. Remember to breathe, honey. [Marie breathing heavily] What's goin' on? Will you talk to me? I don't know anyone. I don't have any friends. What if I never meet anyone? What if I never meet a nice boy? You will. -How? -I'm working on it. I promise. You just have to be patient. How did you meet dad? I've known your father almost my whole life. Well, I think that when we get out of here, maybe you should get a divorce. Noted. -[Rain pattering] -[Thunder rumbling] [Thunder rumbling] [Water dripping] [Exhales sharply] Hey, grandma. Hi there, young man. Come. -Come here. -What are you doing in here? -[Water dripping] -Mom? -Oh, my god. -What's that smell? I think that's rain. [Sarah grunts] Michael, come help us. Uh... well, will you help me move this? -This? -This, yes. I was just missing your mama like crazy, and I just wanted to make sure that, that everything was perfect for when she comes home. [Water dripping] Oh, my god. Michael, can you go get me a spoon? Grandpa says she's never coming back. Um... Oh. How does he know? Your grandpa doesn't know everything. God, the ceiling is wet. It's soft. [Rain pattering] What was she like? She was magnificent. I mean, she is magnificent. -You look just like her. -[Chuckles] Come here, you crazy kid. [Chuckles] I think I can dig through. [Water dripping] -[Scraping] -[Water dripping] [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Doorbell ringing] [Knocking on door] How can I help you? [Knocking on door] -How can I help you? -Hi. So sorry to wake you. I was just, um... There's a light flashing outside of your house. I, I didn't know if you knew or not. It looked like someone was trying to signal or something. Really? [Chuckles] Probably just my imagination. Well, thank you. I will check it out. -Have a good night. -Goodnight. -[Irene] Don? -Reenie, go back to bed. It's nothing. [Door shuts] [Panting] No. Ah! -[Don grunting] -[Sarah groaning] -Dad, stop! -[Sarah screaming] [Sarah sobbing] -[Sarah sobbing] -It's okay. [Door shuts] [Sarah sobbing] Well, can you, can you tell me what to do? -Please. -[Sarah grunting] Something's wrong. -Something's really wrong. -What do I do? [Sobbing] I don't know. [Sarah grunting] [Sarah breathing heavily] [Sarah grunting] [Instrumental music] [Sarah] No, no, no, no...

What's wrong with you? Nothing. Everything's fine. Well, get that look off your face. You look just like her. -Who? -Your grandmother. She always had this sour look on her face. Like nothing was ever good enough. You know, I don't have to come down here if I don't want. [Sarah] I'm sorry, Don. I'm just tired. Oh, you're tired? What from? From working so hard? You don't know what it's like up there. They're laying off people left and right. I'll be lucky to hang on to my job by Christmas. Hm. How's Thomas? Thomas is doing great. He's eating like a wild animal. He's getting big, he's getting strong. Next year he wants to play football in addition to baseball. I'd like to play someday. Well, you certainly will be able to as soon as your mother learns to behave herself. When will that be? [Marie] Yeah, when will that be? A month? A year? Two years? Well, well, I don't know. It all depends on mom, right? Right. He's sorry he asked. [Michael] What's wrong with asking, huh? [Marie] Fifteen minutes? [Sarah] He would have said no. How do you know? He treats you like garbage! I just do. You don't know him. -You barely let us speak to him! -That's true. Yeah, I'm trying to protect you, and I'm doing the best that I can! This is your fault! You are the reason we're down here! No, he keeps us in here like animals. -I just wanna go outside! -Me, too! [Marie] We just wanna go outside, mom! Do something! Shut up!

Do you remember the story I used to tell you about the fairy Princess and how her father cut off her wings? My favorite story. [Sarah] Yeah. That's kind of my story. I'm the fairy Princess. And who do you think Don is? That's dad. Your husband. He lives upstairs with aunt reenie who helps takes care of Thomas. Right? I grew up upstairs with my sister Amy. I had a mom and dad, too. But my dad and I didn't get along. He was awful. And I had this boyfriend who I was so in love with. -Prince Christopher? -Yeah. Anyway, we were gonna run away together after I turned 18, but my dad must've known, because he tricked me and he locked me down here. So, when did you meet dad? Aunt reenie isn't my aunt. She's my mom. Don is her husband... Who is also my dad, and, and is also your dad. [Marie sobbing] Do you understand what I'm telling you? No. No, I don't. -[Sarah] I'm sorry. -[Breathing heavily] -Marie! -[Breathing heavily] She's having an asthma attack. [Marie breathing heavily] You have to breathe. It's okay. -It's okay. Come on. -What's wrong with us? Nothing is wrong with you. I love you both so, so much. Okay? There's nothing wrong with you. It's him. It's always been him. Come here. I love you both so much. You mean everything to me, okay? [All sobbing] [Door opens] [Don] I don't wanna hear it. -There's not much here. -What did I just say? -You don't wanna hear it. -Just heard it. -It's ration. -We are already rationing. Ration more! Back off. You got to take better care of yourself. You look like hell. Shut up! Don't talk to her like that! Or what? What are you gonna do? You're not gonna do anything. You can't do anything. You know, Thomas is younger than you, but he's bigger than you. He's more man than you'll ever be. -[Grunting] -[Sarah] Michael! -[Grunting] -[Don groans] [Sarah] Michael! Hey! [Michael grunts] -[Sarah] Calm down. -[Beeping] Stop. [Michael grunting] [Michael sobbing] [Instrumental music] ♪ I remember holding tight ♪ ♪ felt like fallin' ♪ Did you get fired?

What are you doing? I'm just trying to see how many miles I can get out of this thing. Watch out for your fingers. -You okay? -Yeah. -I'm fine. -You sure? I told you about choices and consequences, right? Yeah. Sometimes... You make a bad choice. You thought it was a good choice, but it's a bad choice. And I'm trying to figure it out. I'm sure you'll figure it out, grandpa. [Instrumental music] [Door shuts] [Beeps] [Breathing heavily] -[Michael] Mom, what do we do? -Hold on, sweety. But we always get past this. Remember? You just have to breathe, Marie, all right? -[Indistinct chatter] -...Second base. And I scored... See you. The cake that I had made, it says, go team. -Just have to keep breathing. -[Coughing] Sorry, I’m... I gotta get some food, I'm sorry. -Rare? -Oh, yes! Yes, please! My mouth is watering right now. -There you go. -Thanks, grandpa. -Great game today. -Thank you. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have, uh, been inspired to show them losers what was what. [Indistinct chatter] -He's a good kid. -Yeah. [Michael] He said he'd come after the baseball game. He should be here. I think we should entertain more often. -I'm gonna go get the cake. -Okay. Excellent. Where the-the hell is he? Can you stop it? That is not helping! -[Sobbing] -She's getting worse. Help me, help me get her on her side. Come on. Come on, help me. She's gonna throw up. -[Marie breathing heavily] -[Indistinct chatter] [Door opens] What the hell is going on here? She just had an asthma attack, and she's barely breathing. She needs to go to a doctor, now! -No, no. I can't risk it. -She's dying! What, you hate us that much? Well, maybe it's for the best. [Marie sobbing] -Y-You love Thomas, don't you? -He's a good kid. Yeah, okay, well, if you really care about him, you're gonna just let his sister die? She needs to go to the hospital! She needs a doctor now! You will tell 'em. I know you. No, you don't. I won't say anything. I swear, I won't say anything! Please! [Sarah] Dad, please just... I-I, I just wanna be with her, please! [Sobbing] Please, daddy. Come on, please. [Exhales] Fine. Fine! We'll go to the hospital. Pick her up! You're staying. He'll die down here, no one will find him. [Indistinct chatter] [Beeps] Go! Go! What the hell. [Marie coughing] Just take deep breaths, okay? Can we get a little help here? [Machine beeping] [Diane] Help her. She's coding. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Clear! Again. -[Beeping] -[Diane] Got her. [Indistinct announcement on pa] [Sarah sniffles] -Hi. I'm Diane. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -[Don] How is she? Uh, she's in critical condition, but, unfortunately, we haven't been able to identify any of her medical history, so I was hoping that you could catch us up. How often does she have such severe asthma attacks? Well, she's home-schooled, so we've been giving her home remedies. [Don] And it's all been fine until... So she hasn't received any professional medical care in the last 18 years? No vaccinations? [Diane] No shots? Nothing? [Don] Everything's been fine until now. Okay, well, why don't you just update your contact information? And I'll make sure that the doctor comes down to see you. -[Don] Thank you. -All right? [Diane] Yeah, thank you. [Man on pa] Dr. Percell GP is on line 4. Whoever is paging, Dr. Percell GP is on line 4. I have to go to the bathroom. Absolutely not. You'll stay right there in that seat. -[Cell phone beeps] -[Indistinct announcement on pa] What the hell? Stay right there. [Woman on radio] 64 Charlie to central K. 64 Charlie. [Dramatic music] -[Indistinct announcement on pa] -[Indistinct chatter] [Siren blaring] [Man on pa] Whoever's looking for general surgery... -[Indistinct chatter] -Thanks. [Intense music] [Don] Sarah! Sarah! I need help. Sir? Sir? -May I have a word with you? -Certainly. [Security] Can we step to the side, just talk, please? [Machine beeping] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, relax. Hey, breathe, relax. Breathe deep breaths in and out. You're safe. -You're safe. -Oh, where are we? We're at the hospital. We got out. Well, where's dad? The police arrested him. [Sarah] He's going away for the rest of his life. We're safe. We're free. It's over. -[Sobbing] -[Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct radio chatter] [Breathing heavily] [Groaning] [Sobbing] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Thomas] Marie, come. [Marie] Hey, pass it here. -I'm open. [Thomas] Hey, did you see that? [Thomas] Here. Come here, come here. Pass it to me. Pass it to me. [Indistinct chatter] [Music continues] [Engine revving] Mom, there's someone here. [Music continues] -It's nice out here. -[Sarah] Yeah. [Sarah] What do you have in that bag? -[Chris] It's a surprise. -Oh. [Sarah] We talked about this once. Do you remember? House on a lake. Yeah. I'm sorry. I've been sorry for years. For what? Just for believing that bs story. Not coming to find you. [Sighs] I thought about you every day for 20 years. It's, it's really good to see you. Yeah, it's really good to see you, too. I, uh, I, uh, I still wanted to give you this. I've been holding on to it. Figured if you ever came back, you might like it. [Chuckles] -Oh, my gosh. -Yeah. Uh, 18-year-old me put a lot of thought in that. I remember, I was pretty proud of myself. -Thank you. -You're very welcome. What do you say?
