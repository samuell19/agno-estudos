[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] It's two o'clock and, uh... the summit's up there. But if you don't leave base camp, you'll never get to the top. K2 has been a boyhood dream. TONY: Why do people do extreme sports? It's to test themselves. It's a sense of achievement. It's a sense of overcoming the elements. It's a sense of overcoming one of the most awe-inspiring things in the world. [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] [KOBI SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [ALL CHANTING] KOBI: It's an unbelievably spiritual place to be. MIKE: I love big expeditions. I love great challenges. [ENGINE REVVING] [BELLOWING] To travel with a car from your front door in Switzerland all the way to Pakistan crossing 13 countries, I like the challenge of the expedition. And I like to overcome this challenge. [ENGINE REVVING] [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] MIKE: I was never really interested in Everest because everybody seemed to always want to go to the highest. I wanted to go to the most difficult place. You don't have to be someone to do something. You have to just be yourself. [CROWD SINGING AND CLAPPING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] We kind of become these creatures of comfort at home. But to step out of that comfort zone can only help you in life. [EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY] [CHANTING] [CHUCKLES] This is maybe not a place that everybody wants to spend a lot of time. Because it's rock, it's ice. It's wind, it's snow, it's rain. And as soon as you leave the comfort zone of airplanes, cars and you have to put on your walking shoes, then there's complications. It's not only difficult terrain, with rocks and boulders that you have to pass. It's psychologically difficult for people, as well. And if you really want to climb K2, you have to start with just getting there. The choice of driving to Pakistan by car never really entered my mind before. It was always getting the plane, fly to Pakistan as quickly as possible, get to K2 and climb. And then what? So, what I thought was, "How can you make this climb even more interesting?" How can you add an "unknown" factor to it? How can you learn more from just coming here? And that's when the idea of driving to K2 just came into my mind. [ENGINE REVVING] Usually, when you fly over the countries, you don't really experience the countries. And traveling is about meeting people. And the more people you meet, the better you understand the country actually going through. [ALL SINGING] I thought you couldn't drink here. The process is too long. [ALL SINGING LOUDLY] Smile! Cheers! Cheers! This is the best day of my life. [WOMAN CHUCKLING] Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The fifth country in two days. We just crossed the border from Latvia into Russia. Sometimes, if you have to wait, and you don't see the importance of waiting, then you can get frustrated. They wanted to take my license away. But, Dima spoke to him and said, "I walked around Russia." and he said, "Okay. Then give me a souvenir." Now, we can go again. The police stopped us again. In less than two kilometers, we were stopped twice. The first one, we negotiated. This one, I didn't speak one word of Russian. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING FRENCH] English. [BOTH LAUGHING] MIKE: This is going to take a long time. We stopped now for the third time... in a very short... We need a lot of souvenirs. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] MIKE: My two daughters, Annika and Jessica, could join part of the trip simply because I would like to share what I experience as an explorer with the people that surround me. I knoW about your trip. It's wonderful. But it's very, very difficult. The Russians seem to be cold when you see them the first time. Actually, when you get to know them, they're extremely warm. They're extremely giving. And they will give you everything and more than what they can afford or have. My daughter. Jessica. Hello. My other daughter, Annika. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] We've kept going non-stop, that was day after day, to cover over 11,000 kilometers in about ten and a half days of driving sets the pace. [ENGINE REVVING] [TRAIN SIGNAL] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MIKE: It is comfortable that we had the shower. Our first shower at base camp of K2. Every ten days, we have a shower. And now we're waiting for the mountain to get rid of the snow. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Now, patience becomes the biggest enemy. You all right? All right! [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] MIKE: Yes! The weather is not great, but we're slowly but surely acclimatizing. Yes, yes. And that's all we need to do at this stage. And we don't need great weather. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] Look there. Avalanche. Both sides of the ridge, going down the avalanche. Big one, the older avalanche. You see? They're crossing all the tracks down. Today is the third avalanche. MAN: What happens if you're in there? You die. You die. One avalanche like this, you can put a building, and they will break it. You can't imagine the power. Because it's coming maybe from 2,000 meters high. They can have the speed at maybe more than 200 kmph. And right down there, there's massive power. If I want to cross the valley from there to there, maybe 45 minutes to one hour. And the avalanche is ten seconds. [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] MIKE: We're in Kazakhstan. And Kazakhstan is exactly how you can imagine it to be. Flat, small little towns and villages. Certain parts of the road were completely destroyed. DMITRY: I'm in Kazakhstan! I drive through the fields and dust. This is my New Zealand driving license. I'm not sure if I am eligible here or not. Because I have only New Zealand driving licence. Only Russian. But I think it'll be really cool. We're getting closer. K2. But this is only the fuel and we're only in Kazakhstan. In the way that we'd traveled and been stopped, and our plans had to change, and the route has to be changed, and people get tired and people get irritated with each other. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Then you, all of a sudden see, but, "Wow, we're all just human beings trying to make it work." Fifty kilometers of bad road. I thought climbing up to 8,000 meters will me tiring. But trying to cross the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan took the whole day today. We drove through the night, over 1,100 kilometers. Then it took us over 14 hours to go from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan to this restaurant. I think now we are double-sated. We appreciate food much more because we spent all day waiting and waiting and waiting. And we did not even know if we will be able to leave Kazakhstan today and enter Uzbekistan today. [MEN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] People have always asked me what exploration has taught me. Today, I can honestly say that exploration taught me a lot of patience. And I am ready for the next lesson down the road.

You need not only to know your own capabilities, but the capabilities of the friends that actually climb with you. [KOBI SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] The speed limit is 80 kilometers. And we are already at double. [CHUCKLING] MIKE: What I really like about working together with Kobi and Fred is the trust. That trust that can never be broken. We have one common goal. But to reach that common goal, we have to respect each other. Now, we're really stuck. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] With Kobi and Fred, they like it. They think it's a joke. But I don't think it's a joke, because we have to get to Pakistan. [ALL LAUGHING] [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] MIKE: Fred would give a strong opinion, Kobi would give a strong decision and I'm the tourist in the group. I'm just there to kind of bond everybody together. In a way, we've become this triangle of friends that dream about the same thing. [WOMEN SINGING] [ORIENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] In Kashgar, China. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [ROOSTER CROWING] [CHEERING] [WATER FLOWING] MIKE: Many people come to K2 and think it's like Everest. It is a mountain that I would like to conquer. But you cannot conquer a mountain. The mountain allows you to go to the top. It's welcoming, but it can be very cold. And a very dangerous spot to be at the wrong moment. But it's the human being that actually makes the mountain dangerous. You prepare yourself for the challenge. And you're willing to make certain sacrifices to get there. Then, you can start climbing. And that, to me, is a metaphor in life. [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] And then come to here. [MAN SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] [MIKE SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] [MIKE SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [MIKE SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] [FRED CHUCKLING] We are quite comfortable. It's four o'clock. The sun is still out. But we're going to have a sleep of more or less, I think, 12 hours, now, no? FRED: Yeah. Good, uh? Taking the shoes off. And then sitting on your mattress. [SPEAKING FRENCH] And at this stage, we don't have to close the tent because it's too warm. [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] MIKE: So, tomorrow we are going to go to camp three. And try to get up to 7,500 meters. We arrived here in the heat of the day at about one o'clock. And now we've had a couple of farmers or only one farmer. One. That's what we're eating tonight. And we had, uh... Yeah, we boiled some water and we had a cup of coffee. And a little bit of soup. Yes, and that's it. And that's it. Look, my dinner. You know I dream about what? A big hamburger and it had a lot of mayonnaise and ketchup. [BOTH LAUGHING] Mmm. All right. Yeah, all right. FRED: That's life. That's life in the... K2 lane. But it's just... Be a little bit patient and see what happens tomorrow evening and then we'll get down this mountain very quickly. And then go and have chapatis. [CHUCKLING] Yes! Oh, yeah. I love chapatis. Chapatis and rice. Chapatis and rice and dal. And dal. Hmm. And we'll finish like this. MIKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ["THE ONE EXCEPTIONS" PLAYING] ♪ Butterfly flying Into the storm ♪ ♪ I brace myself For what's to come ♪ ♪ You're a sight To behold ♪ ♪ A story yet to be told ♪ KOBI: The most impressive impact and power of nature that I've seen on this whole trip was when half a mountain slid down and created this massive lake that covered the road. And people were stuck on the other side so they had to invent in two seconds a different way of transport. So, we arrived with our cars and we see these little wooden boats... [KOBI CHUCKLING] ...with pieces of wood put across them. And we asked, "Where's the ferry?" And there's no ferry. FRED: And I saw Mike going in the plank, which is almost the size of the wheels. MIKE: Yeah, yeah. Driving like this. On the boat. And I was thinking, "Where is the boat for me?" And they said, "You have to go to the same boat." [ALL LAUGHING] KOBI: Yeah. How you can put two cars in a small boat like this? Slowly, slowly! Tip-top? [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [MOTOR REVVING] FRED: It is amazing how these guys actually just did it. From one day to the other, life continued. MIKE: Thousands of houses were underneath the water. Whatever they had was no longer there, and taken away from them. And they're happy, smiling and still loving life. Like nothing happened. Only in Pakistan, 500 captains. [ALL LAUGHING] MIKE: If it had to be done in Europe, it will take about 15 years to work out a system, but here they work it out in five minutes.

Yes. The problem is... But the problem wasn't my car. They're not your four wheels working. That's because four wheels were not working. Now, we're going to do it! [ENGINE REVVING] [ALL CHEERING] [LAUGHING] We made it. [LAUGHING] Hello, everybody. My name is Khalil. I'm a cook from Swiss expedition, Mr. Mike Horn, in K2 base camp. Our teams love to party. So, today I make them... How to make chapati, I show them. MIKE: Khalil. You're welcome, sir. Today, I give the chapati lesson. Oh, yes. Because each time I go home, I tell my daughters I eat very good chapati. And they say, "Make chapatis." I say, "I don't know how." KHALIL: So, you come and sit here. Your hand is very clean. Very important to clean your hands. You need one pot like this. Clean up. Very important. Then you need flour. Then you need salt. Then you need water. MIKE: Pour the water. That is just mixing. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] KHALIL: We have one dough ready. Mr. Mike, you keep this one. And Mr. Fred, you keep this one. Mr. Kobi, you keep this one. Thank you. KHALIL: Not too much! MIKE: No, no, no. Don't worry. FRED: How's that now? It's becoming smaller, not bigger. [ALL LAUGHING] Khalil, what's next? [CHANTING] [KHALIL SPEAKING SHINA] FRED: It is better I bring water. Khalil, how do we cook this chapati? Okay, sir, now you put it. Then appear the chapati. MIKE: Oh, no. [ALL LAUGHING] The chapati is completely destroyed. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] Oh, nice and brown, eh? [ALL LAUGHING] KHALIL: Very good! FRED: All done! Cheers! That is tip-top. Now, we have to give a little bit of the chapati to Khalil to taste.

MIKE: This is where one of the high-altitude porters come from, according to Fred. He's called Ali, and he's saved a lot of people up on K2 already. He lives here somewhere. And he said he's gonna find Ali. MIKE: How are you doing? MIKE: I come. I come to visit you, huh? MIKE: I know him long time. ALI: How are you? How are you? Come here. KOBI: Good. You are happy? ALI: Yes, yes. MIKE: Everything okay? Very good. FRED: In this village, there is local porters. They carry load from Askole to get to base camp. Quite heavy loads, 35 kg, 25 personal material for the Swiss expeditions and maybe 50 kg from the sleeping bags and the food you have to eat from all the way. I think they are tough guys. These are the most important people to do expedition. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] In our side, we choose one woman. Yeah. Yeah? We married this woman, and we are in my life. She is life. Together, whole life. In Europe, this is little bad things, you know? You are change every time, change every time. [ALL LAUGHING] This is amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, Fred never change. Me? Me? I never change. FRED: Yeah, yeah. Dima, changed six times already. [ALL LAUGHING] And Kobi never change. Never change? KOBI: No. MIKE: We've been to Pakistan about five times and each time we cross Ali on the mountain. He's a HAP, a high altitude porter. And in 2013, when we decided to turn back at Chengdu, it was with Ali that we decided to turn back. ALI: After we at base camp, then after one day, there was avalanche problem. We thought that the mountain wasn't ready to be climbed, and that's when the whole expedition moved down the mountain that nobody summited. I'm lucky, and thanks for you and Mike and my friends, we are safe this time. [CONVERSATION IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [ALL LAUGHING] KOBI: Can you eat that? You like sugar, sir? MIKE: No, no, no. ALI: No salt? FRED: No. KOBI: Just like that. Milk. Milk. ALI: Just milk? MIKE: Yeah. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] FRED: Big boss. First, big boss. If he still alive, we drink. But if he die... [LAUGHING] If he die, we don't drink. [LAUGHING] We look at his face first. Because he have a stomach like African stomach, you know? MIKE: Oh, this is good. This is very good. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] Like home. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] We've decided to walk up the mountains a little bit, to get a little bit of altitude, first of all, and to get the legs going. We're sitting in this alpage. It's completely just made out of stone and rock, drinking warm caramel. It's quite cold, but this is really the most amazing moment of the trip so far. Just gaining altitude and the simplicity of the whole situation is wonderful. [SHOUTING] [SHOUTING] Many times without wife here, sir. Uh, many time. MAN: Getting crazy. He's now 25 days without wife here. Twenty-five days, no wife here? [MAN SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY] [ALL LAUGHING] Good. Good. [ALL CHUCKLING] Kobi is a person that I appreciate simply because his knowledge and what he has done in life prior to meeting him put him in a different category. If you take action as a criteria to trust somebody, then you base yourself on a solid foundation. And that's what Kobi has. His action is so solid that everybody trusts that foundation. So, looking in behind the tooth, I can see an area of abscess. But the fact that you have some tenderness on that tooth makes me think that you might have a problem from an old root canal. And if you continue to have pain like this, then I think maybe the chances for the summit are 50-50, maybe. But we'll give you some pills to get you by. With the altitude, he has the pressure changes. But also, the... um, nutrition is such that you're more prone to dental infections. MIKE: Frustrations, you'll always have in life. If you think for one second that you're so important that everything must go exactly according to plan, then you're making one of the biggest mistakes in life. We've been stuck in Skardu, Pakistan, for over 12 days, now, waiting for our permit to come. Nobody can give us any information. The big problem is that the other expeditions that do climb with oxygen, they don't need as much time at base camp as we do. And that's why it's important for us to leave early. We've missed the first weather window, because we will now only be able to do the summit push towards the end of July. And towards the end of July will be our last chance to climb. And, um, this is getting to a stage that it's putting our whole expedition on the balance. And all we're waiting for is one guy signing a piece of paper. Very important. Maybe other day... To reach camp three, we need time. Yes, sure. And after sleeping in camp three, we need two, three days' rest. It's impossible. There's not enough time. We need a fucking chance. We need to have one good weather. "If there is a good window 14, 17, 16..." It's only for rocky mountains. Yes. Sure. We have a chance end of July. Yes, but end of July is only four weeks. We arrive here. Yeah. After that it's one week, two, three, four weeks. Only have one chance, end of July. All right. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] FRED: Let's be positive. [MEN TALKING] [FRED SPEAKING FRENCH] We have to be realistic. Yeah. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] I know Fred since 18, 19 years old, and straightaway, I could see something very special in him. I was a teacher, teaching mountain guides in Switzerland how to do canyoning. And straightaway, I saw somebody that was really passionate and interested about life. He has his moods, like we all have. But before he climbs, he sorts out his problems, and then he climbs with freedom. And that's what makes him a very special person. MIKE: He trusts his knowledge, and he's a lovely person to live with. [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] MIKE: You need somebody like that. We all need to be people like that. Whoo! Over the ridge! [FRED LAUGHING] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHTER] MIKE: Uh, Fred, do you like driving off-road? Of course. [LAUGHS] FRED: He was trying to drive a little bit under water. When you follow Mike, and you see the car going... [MAKES GLUGGING SOUNDS] So, Fred coming up, the car straight... Stuck. Back. Back. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] MIKE: Go! [PRAYER ON LOUDSPEAKER] [HONKS] Good luck! [SPEAKING FRENCH] MIKE: In daily life, it's all about ourself. It's all about who you are. It's all about what car you drive. It's all about what house you live in. But, yeah, that doesn't matter. Change is something that makes people afraid, simply because it means I have to go into the unknown. The unknown adds spice to life. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Without friendship, without teamwork, without the ability to laugh and cry together, without the ability to help each other, you could never do it. It's impossible. It's just too much. So, we are in between camp two and three now. We passed the most technical part, but first, now, let's cover the previous tracks. And the only thing we have to do now is to push on slowly, slowly. And then we will, um, eventually make it to camp three, where we will set up a tent. And tonight, we would like to sleep at 7,100, and tomorrow, push to 7,500. Then, we're ready for the summit push. This camp three. Tomorrow, we'll move on to 7,500 meters. Inshallah. Inshallah, yes. And then, uh, we'll... From there, we will make a U-turn and go straight down to base camp. He's the serious man. He wants to share every single bit of passion with us. It definitely brings you a lot closer, and gets us to understand him a lot more. MIKE: This was an opportunity for them to bond with me. To be able to understand how I think, to be able to understand, why would I want to go to the top of K2. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ MIKE: And Kobi gives me a biberli. Yummy. Mike. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] One, two, three, four. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Mike ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [CHEERING] Okay, we've got this beautiful cake here... with jelly and everything. Now, taste. FRED: A speech, a speech. Yeah. Thank you... You're welcome, sir. ...everybody, for being here. Yeah. And, uh, hopefully, this is my last birthday on K2. [LAUGHING] Inshallah, we can summit. Yeah, inshallah. And then we can go to Broad Peak, no? Yes, sir. Then go forward, yeah. One peak for Fred first... Yeah, yeah. ...and then Nanga Parbat, no? Ali Ahmed, you coming with? [LAUGHS] Just like that, eh? Cheers, guys. Thanks a lot. Cheers. So, what we actually have here is, um, all the equipment that we'll take up to base camp. We need the meat. I was afraid... A lot of dried meat. They're lovely, lovely pieces, look at them. [SPEAKING SWISS GERMAN] Tomorrow, we'll be leaving for the trekking. And it's quite long there, and I want to buy maybe two pieces of chocolate for the walk. Which one is the best one? Sulphur. Sulphur, yes. They use sulphur, this one, natural? Natural, yes. SELLER: Ismail, do this please. This is the number one stock? Two piece. Okay? Okay. Any more? How is your cherries? Cherries, 200 rupees a kilo. Two hundred rupees a kilo? Kilo. Oh, too much. [SPEAKS HINDI] [SPEAKS HINDI] [SPEAKS URDU] But why Pakistan not make better roads? No, no. Pakistan... Look, Pakistan... No? No. You want Pakistan road. [WHISTLE] The crampons are good, the shoes for you are good, packs for you are good. Fantastic. BOTH: Yeah, we're back again. Look at us! Ready for hiking up to base camp. At long last, Fred will tell you what happened. It's one of his happiest days in the last... 16 days. Because today, as you can see behind us, we are actually going to go up to Askoli. Inshallah. You are never sure until you are there, you know, in Pakistan. This is the team. And Dima, and Nils, our cameraman, he's obviously behind the camera. We're ready for lots of arduous walking up a hill, which is going to be very interesting, I can assure you. Oh, yeah. MIKE: This is not the G-Class, because the road has actually been blocked. Now, we have to take the cars halfway... unload them, carry all the equipment to the other side of the road, where the road has been blocked, and then load them in other jeeps. So, this is where the G-Class stops. And these guys only do a shuttle there and back, there and back. Let's try and see if they will get us there safely. My name is Tony Buckingham, and I'm from England, and the reason I'm here is because of Mike Horn. MIKE: Sometimes, you can take people away from the life that they're living and open up another life so that they can find answers that they can apply in the way they live daily. That's why I'm sitting here, at the base camp of K2, looking at, possibly, one of the most awe-inspiring sights I've ever seen. MIKE: For me to be able to share what we've done with Tony was a privilege. I think the Baltoro teaches all of us different lessons. To have a friend like Tony that said, "Listen, Mike, if this is a dream, this can be a dream for me, to be able to get to the base camp of Baltoro as well." We started sharing this dream. He said, "We're going to K2 together." I said, "You've gotta be joking." "You're a madman." I said, first of all, I don't climb. Secondly, I'm afraid of heights. And, thirdly, no. He said to me, "You know, Tony..." He said it's going to be "completely flat." He said, "It's like a walk in the park." He said, "You don't have to worry about anything." He said, "Really easy." See if anyone calls that flat. [LAUGHS] And, of course, like an idiot, I believed him. What the fuck am I doing here? How much more of this am I gonna walk over? Jesus Christ, the terrain is just so lethal. Is there a quick way out of here? [LAUGHS] And you realize, no, there's no quick way out of here. So, you gotta put your head down and you gotta keep going. Not easy going. It's really something else. You're starting to feel the altitude slightly, with fantastic scenery. But it was hard. It was hard. It's not for the faint-hearted. MIKE: This guy is unbelievable, carrying that weight up here. Not for one day, for seven days. We're very fortunate. Very lucky. You can't really see the glacier, so it's covered with gravel and massive rocks. You can easily lose the way as well. ALI: This year, the route is hundred percent changing. This year, very difficult way. Glacier is up, down, up, down. I'm, every year, coming this way but I don't know where is the way now. Completely changed. MIKE: But if you just follow the donkeys, and the horses, you can always find the camp because they know where they can get water and food. This is the most important man of everybody. He's called the "sirdar." And the "sirdar..." Sardar Ali. ...is the person responsible to distribute the loads, distribute the food of everybody around you. He goes all the way up to base camp with us. So, this guy, you have to be his best friend. Otherwise, when he goes on strike, you're stuck. Huh? Yeah. Fucking glacier. I hate the blasted place. ANNIKA: Eat something nice. We'll rest a little bit. And then we can attack again. Only two more hours, and we'll be at that camp for the night. Thank God. MIKE: What's very important to understand is that nothing goes to waste. We might be for animals, or against killing animals to feed human beings. But without animals, these people cannot live. And if they have to carry vegetables up here, it will be rotten in two days in the sun. So, they only way then can actually feed themselves is by actually making the animals walk with them. [SPEAKING URDU] They've slaughtered two goats. And as we're going up the glacier, they'll have a hard time to find food. So, the porters will have the last real big meal divide all the meat in between. They've got a hundred porters that's left. They'll come together and each one takes his portion, heads off, makes his little fire, and cooks his last real meal. [SPEAKS URDU] From here on, it'll only be chapati for them. FRED: They invited me to eat some chapati, but I think I don't want to eat because they have only that, you know. We may have a big dinner over there. I don't want to take the food from them now. Because, these guys, they are very strong. They walk hours and hours with only a few chapati in the stomach, it's amazing. Baltoro chapati. Eh? Baltoro chapati. That's the best. [SINGING] TONY: You've really got to get out of your comfort zone. You've really got to feel uncomfortable occasionally, to appreciate what it's like to be alive. MIKE: So, we've just arrived at Concordia, an iconic spot where you can see the mighty K2. It's taken us five days to walk up here. We've had very, very good porters that have actually helped us to get here much quicker than what we've expected to get here. Now, from here, we have to trek across the glacier and then we'll follow the moraine all the way up to the K2 base camp. Just look around. Unbelievable. Base camp's on a moraine, so, the moraine goes up and down. To put our tents, we have to level the moraine a little bit and put the finer gravel right over the bigger rocks so that we can sleep more or less flat. This is gonna be an interesting meeting. We are finding the source of the weather. Do you see the cloud? Yeah, yeah. Do you see this light gray or light green? This is a high overcast that we're getting now. There's 26, when you see lifting up like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure we have thunder and lightning, or a storm here. MIKE: We're not gonna wait until August. I'll need little gappers, basically, now. MIKE: Wind, five knots. Ah. It's almost perfect weather. MIKE: Fred, what time do you wanna start? Midnight, two o'clock, something like this. Yeah, okay. Two o'clock, but now it's warm, yeah? After two o'clock, no fell down, stones... Usually, we are right between 10:00 and midday. Okay, yeah. Okay. We can rest all day and we can start again at midnight to camp four. Okay, I think we're gonna spend another six hours to reach the shoulder. Oh. The snow... In the snow. Yeah, or ten hours. Yeah, yeah. Worst case. Worst case, ten hours. We're gonna reach camp four shoulder at 10:00 a.m. again. And we can start again at 10:00 p.m. that day. On the same day. I think that's a very good idea. Okay. This is the schedule. We're gonna be on the summit around 11:00 a.m. or something like that. Yeah. Yes. Uh, 25. Yeah. And it's supposed to be the best day, totally clear with no precipitation, and the best temperature. Okay? FRED: It's 55. MIKE: If we see the cloud coming over Chogolisa, coming in quickly, um, we just go back. We go, and every day, we look what's happening. We go, we go, we go, and if it's not possible, we go down. Yes. That's it. The earlier we get to the summit, the more time we have to get back to camp three in bad weather. Yeah. Yes. MIKE: This mountain will, from the bottom to the top, it will take maybe two days to climb and one day to get down. It's like a lifeline. And if you get to a moment that you doubt, then you're doing something wrong. K2 gives you a very small weather window to climb. If you're not 100 percent ready as well, then the mountain's gonna kill you. Ali. You want to go back to Nepal? Uh? It's better, sir. If the mountain doesn't allow me to climb, I'm not going to take one risk to get to the summit. Because my life today has a different meaning. Maybe you lose your wife like I lost my wife, but you've got two beautiful daughters next to it that will enrich your life as much. So, Kobi, big gloves, you have? Yes. Small. Small gloves. Gas? Gas, one, yeah. Water bottle? Two bottles. MIKE: The conditions are good. It's warm, no snow, and, uh... we have a very good chance of getting up to 8,000 meters. Okay, bye, guys. Bye. Before all big travels, you have to sit a little bit and think. And I like to sit and think a bit. And then when I start thinking, I go... Yep, base camp. Don't run! Everything boils down to making the first step. And this is just what's happening here. It's two o'clock, and the summit's up there. But if you don't leave base camp, you'll never get to the top. ALI: Base camp, camp three. How do you feel? Mike saab. Now, I think we all work well. Yeah. And now, pitch the tent, eat, sleep and go. FRED: The conditions have changed a bit now. For me, too much snow. ALI: In the mountain, yeah? Yes, the whole mountain has snow. Heavy snow, yes. Heavy snow, yeah. Yeah. You've seen only that. Yeah, if we strong enough, then make possible, yeah? Yeah, it's the summit. There is no summit. [LAUGHS] I don't know. Me, yesterday, I was very tired. And I don't know if I have the power to make the trek till there. And if I have the power, after, I don't know the next day, to the top. I think the chance is quite... Small. Thick snow... [PANTING] Strong winds made us turn around. Unfortunately, it didn't work out like I wanted it to work out. But, um, we're all alive. We can all try again. This year K2 didn't open its doors and windows for us to get through. But such is life. If you don't try, you'll never know. MIKE: How can you discover new land if you never leave home? To learn, you have to step out of your comfort zone. This way. Now, we really stuck. The machine... Can't go back. Kobi is trying to dive into the water without going too deep, because he says there's rocks underneath it. So, he wants to go "flop". [LAUGHTER] [PANTING]
