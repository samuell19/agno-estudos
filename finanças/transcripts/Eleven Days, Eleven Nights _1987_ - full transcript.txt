For what is worth, my name is Michael? What's yours? I'm Sarah. - Bye bye, Michael! - Bye. (Michael) Hey, Sarah! Whenever you want, ''give me a shout''. - Get rid of this, now. - What about the profiles? - Later. Let's do it fast, before the boss starting to bother. You go first, meanwhile, I'll see if there's something new. - Let's start from here. - I have to tell you a fantastic thing. - Go, now. - Hi, Joe. - Hi. - Hey, I've searching for you all day. - It happened to me the most incredible thing. - Let's hear what is about. - Come on, a ''chick''? - You got it. - Ah, yeah, eh? - Well, what about her "bodywork". How's that? - Super, I can assure you. - Like a Ferrari, I suppose. - More. - At your house? - No, on the ferry! - On the ferry? - Yes. Let's go, buy me a drink. On the ferry... After that we said goodbye... and every one on their way. Sorry, but you're an asshole... You met a woman in heat and you set up nothing? What should I do? A goddess jump up to you and you accomodate only a quickie. - Thanks. - Maybe you forget that I'll marry in 11 days. - It's a mess you deserve. Right... - My gosh, where is it? - What's the matter? - I can't find my wallet. Now I understand your charm. The chick was a burglar. - What the hell are you saying? I'll have left it at home. - A woman never give herself for nothing. What do you think? It's not definite, but it looks good. As you say. I'll take care of the raw material. I like your idea that the 100° is an unknown... ..while everyone else are important men, it's interesting. - The ferry idea is brilliant, really brilliant, but... - But? It seems too short. Too quick, this can't be it. What do we know about him, his life, who's Michael Terenzi? - You've to see him again and go deeper. - Ok, no problem. How you're going to find him? - I'll ''give him a shout''. - Good! Helen! You did it, finally! We have a million things to do. I had a hell of a morning. - I bet you didn't send the invites. - Yes, I've sent them yesterday. Dan was in charge of the cake. Do you know what he's doing? - I don't think he could find it... - He'll not leave us without the cake, I hope. I've seen the dress of the damsel, it's light green, very soft. ..just what I need to stand out, my dress. You should see it, with gloves of the same color and the ribbon. We have to find flowers to match. - Something of light yellow, right? - Yes, sure. - Sorry, but I have to go. - With all the things we have to do? We'll do! - We have an appointment with the furniture people at 18:00. - I'll not forget. What a pain! Hello? Hi, Michael. I'm Sarah. The one of the ferry, remember? Of course I remember. Hi, Sarah. Tell me, How did you get my telephone number? Guess what? Your wallet... you lost it on the ferry. - Yes? - Michael, I want you. I really want to see you. Please, come here, right now. Fifth avenue, number 13. Seventh floor. Sarah Asproon. Hello? Hello, taxi? Sarah, I have to tell you something. I'll marry in 11 days,... ..and I do not intend to postpone the wedding day. I'll just settle for the nights left: 11 nights only for me. I promise to not ask you for one minute more. - Would you like more dessert, Michael? - I'm fine, thanks. What's the matter, Michael, you don't like the dessert made by my wife? - Quite the contrary, I find it very good. - One more slice... - Mother! - What's the matter? - Mother, please! - Helen, I did it for him. He should start getting used to desserts, since you have to live here for the first few months. - Dad, please! - Here? Oh... Michael, Helen is not going to live at the home of a bachelor. You are not going to stay with us for long... ...my husband has already booked a beautiful flat. The problem is that it'll be ready in 6 months. Samuel has done his homework. Your bank agree, Michael, you'll have to do just small monthly payments. We want Helen to be happy. - Are you happy, Michael? - Ehm... I'm sorry, Madam, I have to run, I've got an important job to finish. It was a lovely dinner. Regarding the flat and everything else, we'll talk about those at another time. Helen and I had planned differently, really. Are you there, Sarah? Anybody home? Sarah, where are you? I'm Michael. Where are you? ''Michael, turn on the set and start the tape.'' Hi, Michael, there is a problem. I'm out and I don't know when I'll come back. Good! I'll wait. Thanks for the champagne,... ..but I don't like that you open it without me. - What?! - Female intuition, darling. You wanted to impress me, tonight, and now you're feeling betrayed. But I didn't want leave you alone. See, Michael? It's like I'm here...with you. Without you hardly noticing, I'll become real. I want to make love with you, Michael. I want you, the heat of your skin, you inside me. Look at me, Michael... Don't you see how I desire you? Look... I'm wet. Oh, Michael, take me... - Take me... - Yes, but how? Michael... don't go. My scent is in the air. Can't you feel it, darling? I want to enter in your mind, deep in the soul. Michael, my love... Oh, Michael... I'm mad about you. It hurt me inside, how much I want you. Gosh, I don't want to go crazy. Hello? Why aren't you looking at me? You're mean when you do this. - Sarah, where're you? - I'm there with you, but you don't want me. Why? Do you want me dead, Michael? I'm mad about you and you reject me. - Sarah, why are you waiting to come here? - But I'm there! Don't you see me? - I want your body. - Use your imagination, dear. I'm sorry, I have no imagination. I'm not happy to see, I wanna do. I'm an Old-fashioned man. Are you sure you don't like to watch me, Michael? Let me see what you are capable of, then. You should have seen the look on your face when you take the bottle, ready to open it. - You were so funny! - I don't see anything funny about that. Ah... I'll be serious, then. With her hot body she blew the champagne cork... ...but not the zipper of her lover! It's funny, isn'it? - Why don't you try me, now? - Why not, darling? - What is this? - Ah, the dessert, at Helen's house. - Who's Helen? - Helen, she's... No, I don't care. I don't want you to speak about other women when we're together. - Michael, why don't you rape me? - What?! Please, do it. I want to be raped, Really... Ok, if we go to my house or at yours, I promise I'll rape you. - What's the matter with the house? It's no fun to be raped in a house. Darling, a woman has got to be raped in the street. Don't you know it? No, help! Help, he wants to rape me! - Don't hurt me! Help! - She's a bitch! My husband is a shy person. Michael? Michael! - Thank the officer. - Thanks. - It was a great pleasure. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Were you scared, eh? Listen, Sarah, you're beautiful, one hell of a girl... ..but I'm tired, better forget it, for a while. Maybe in a few months, if you want, we can see each other again. We can pick this up and spend some time together. All right? Bye. Hi! Do you want to know the truth? You're crazy and I'm an asshole. Feel, I'm all wet... Hey... - Where's the panty? - I eat it. - Let's stay along with this. - It's for Mr. Terenzi. - Yes, thanks. Let's talk, Michael. Do you recognize this? It arrived in an envelope with the message: "This is the one I eat." ''Put it on thinking about me.'' There was also this card with an appointment. - ''See you at 22:30 at French Cafè.'' - Give me that, Dan. They're classy... transparent. - Will you stop, Dan? - And it is also fragrant. - Look at that! - Who knows what was in there. - Stop it, everybody's staring. - Really? - Come on, stop it, Dan! It's not your size anyway! I've never seen two men argue for women panty. There's nothing more to look surprised. - Well... - Do you want to come in to drink something? No, Helen, I can't. Dan, he makes me serve for the honeymoon. At least give me a kiss. Not like this. I wanna a true one. I have to go or I will fall asleep before work. Ok. - Bye. - See you tomorrow, honey. Thanks. Are you wearing it? Gimme two minutes then follow me. - What if a woman came in? - Ssh... Be a good boy. Come. Come on. What are you afraid of? Yes, not bad. Very nice indeed. Even if you're not exactly a woman... Now take off your clothes, I wanna see what you look like with my panty on. Honey... Hey, my clothes! Wear mine. I'm sure it fit you well. You'll see, honey. Men are going mad about you. And I'll like it, too. - Are you going nuts? - Do it for me, please. Hurry! The last touch... There you go. Yes, as a bitch, you're very nice. Now look at yourself. What do you think? - Hey, Sarah, don't you want... - Won't keep you waiting, be sure. - What a fantastic show... - I'm an asshole! - Are you hurt, ma'am? - No, thanks, nothing. Please. A sign. - Well. - Here it is. Go! Listen to me, Sarah, I'm tired of your silly games, you understand? Enough! Sarah! Sarah, where're you going? Wait! Taxi! Stop it! - Good evening. - The key, ma'am. - Oh, shit! - A lady never swearing. Thanks. I booked a room on your name, honey. - Please, ma'am... or miss? - Ugh! What's so funny to doing certain things? Get undressed and give me back my clothes, I'm leaving once for all. Why don't you undress me? It's more exciting, isn't it? I'm you and you're me. It's very exciting do the man role. You're a bitch, don't you now, honey? Yes, yes, I'm a bitch... I'm you and you're me, but fuck me now, honey! Oh, yes... Not bad, quite interesting,... ..but still missing something special, something unique. You take care of it, dear, you're lacking not the imagination for sure. My imagination it's not up at yours. Sarah! Here I am. Come closer, Michael. Why don't you hug me? Are you cold? No, you're cold. I feel you awful distant lately, Michael... You're not looking at me. It's only an impression. That's right. - Well... the work, I'm tired. - Poor dear! When we're married... I'll take care of it. Let's go. - Mr Terenzi ? - Yes. - Your order. What order? - Good evening. - Good evening. Who's gonna eat all this stuff? - Hi, what a beautiful kimono! - Hi! - Boys, get into it! - Wonderful! - I love those parties where you can eat. - Please. Give me that. - Hey, slow down, I'm here, too.. - I'll take this.. Uh, this is good! This is delicious! - These wraps are delicious. - It's impossible... - And now let's liven up this morgue. - Charlie, take care of it. Let's see what Michael's got. That's inspiring. Boys, get into it! - I love those! - Pungency and fieriness. - Yes. Hey, boys, stop with the food, listen to the music. Come on, boys, get on with it. Hey, stand up! Hey... It's good, eh? - Didn't your friend have fun? - I don't think so, Charlie. He's been staying there like a gawker. - No! - Out, everybody. Get lost! - Out! - Oh, Michael, why? - You stay! - We were having fun. - Why do we have to go? - Is it true? - Anyway bye bye, darling, see you. - Bye. If you wanna have fun, call me. Come on, don't do that face. If you want me to stay, you've to play by my rules. Bye. - What does it mean ''bye''? - See you another day, honey. Sarah, what's kind of joke is it? Come back... right now! Oh... Michael! Hey, Michael! Wait, do not run away this time too! You're sadistic. Where's the fun in doing such jokes? Ah, Michael, are you really angry with me? If the The Cleaning Lady hadn't shown up... ...the ropes would have broke my wrists: look. Poor dear. What do you take me for? I'm not a masochist. Honey, I want to make love with you. Take this. - Oh... - A gift for you, to make up for the ropes at the wrists. I like man with gold on the skin. - Usually are men who giving gifts to make up for. - Not always. - It's a true evidence of submission. - Ah, yes? - And number 100 what does it mean? - I hope you like it. Yes, it's beautiful, but you don't have to. Ah, by the way. Can you sing? - I'm worse than a tone deaf bell. - It doesn't matter. # Tara-rarira-rairam. Tara-rarira-rairam. # # Tara-rarira-rairam. # It's a smart dog, you know? - Have you the audition, too? - What? - Are you here for the audition? - No. - I'm a songwriter, the greatest. Do you want to her a song? - Yes, of course. Listen to this, then. # I think about your blue pimples, and I love you more! # # I think of you doing poop and I love you more! # # My lover, that's love... # What do you think? Oh... well, it's ok. Great! Yes, really. You'll go straight to the top, you're the best. Michael Terenzi to the first floor. - ''Good luck''. - Thanks! # I think about your blue pimples, and I love you more! # # I think of you doing poop and I love you more! # # My lover, that's love... # - Hi. - Hi, Michael, Sarah is waiting for you. - What is this place? This is the temple of art, my friend. Sarah's kingdom. - Do you mean that's all her stuff? - Well, half of that is also mine. - Over there is the recording room. She's waiting you there. - Ok. - Sarah, we can resume from the last lyric. - Wait a second, Charlie. Put this on. - Ready! - You got it in headphones. Watch out, be ready. - Sarah, we're close - Ok, set it up and go away! As you say, boss. It's all set up, Sarah. Good luck, Michael. - And now it's up on to you. - Sarah, but I can't sing. You don't have to sing... we have to add the sighing. And I want them to be real... It's beautiful! So tender, so romantic. It's great. Michael? Michael! Michael, you were sleeping. It's all over? Just take me home. Helen, listen! Nothing... Bye. Sarah, are you at home? What are you doing here? Who told you to come here? I'll tell you when to come. Sarah, I wanna stay with you. I must make love with you... now, or I'll go crazy. You don't understand. There's another person in my bed. I don't care. Tell him to leave! Why don't you tell him? Please, be my guest. Sure I'm gonna tell him. Hey! Who's she? So, Michael? Why don't you tell her to leave? - Hi, Michael, you're very nice. - Come on, what are you waiting to kick her out? - Michael, she's Francis. - What are you waiting for, don't you see I'm in heat? - I will leave you two alone. - Hey, Sarah! Don't waste your time, honey. Come here, honey, I don't bite. Go on. Just look what happened to me. Mm... the young master don't have easy tastes... ..or simply he's a faggot. My money. I'm sorry, Sarah, It's not my fault. See you soon. Do you want? Come on! - Thanks. - Nothing, son. Helen! - What are you doing here? - I've been waiting you for hours. It doesn't matter now, you're here and I wanna stay all night with you. And tomorrow I wanna wake up by your side. You can't stay here, Helen, go back home. Don't send me away, Michael. Come on. I'll take you home. Michael... ..if there's another woman, you have to tell me. Do you think I didn't notice you're not what you were? But don't worry, I understand certain things... ..because I love you. You're a good looking man, of course the ladies run around you... ..I'm ready for this. I don't want make scenes at you. I know I'm a disaster in love, but with your help I'll learn... ..if that's what you want. Helen, what are you doing here? What's happened? Nothing serious, I hope. Sit down. Go on, sit down. - Do you want a drink or what? What you want. - Where did he go ? - Who? - Michael! - He's out for work but he'll be here soon. - You're making him work too much. - There's a work to deliver, we're late. And must he work at night too? All nights without exception? That's our job. Always under pressure, no schedule. We can't... - How is she? - What do you mean? - Is she pretty? - I don't understand what do you mean! - Don't tease me. - I assure you... - Don't tell me you don't know her, Dan! - Who I should know? We're long time friends... Listen, Helen, I only see her once. And in any case, it will be over soon. Don't worry, she's nothing for him, calm down. - She's only an adventure... - But we're getting married in 5 days! Helen, everything will be fine, don't dramatize it. Now I'm going back home, ok? - Wait and he'll be back like a puppy. - It doesn't matter. Sorry. Oh, shit... Asshole. Hey, Michael, wait! Listen to me, dude! I don't like how you're behaving with Helen these days. You're treating her like one you found in the street... ..that you can throw away whenever you want. - I'm sorry. - Great. The young master says: ''I'm sorry''. The girl you're getting married in a week is a mess because of you. - And all you can say is: ''I'm sorry''. This has to end. You break off that story and apologize with Helen or you leave her alone. Dan, stop it, I'm big enough to choose by myself what to do. - Isn't that clear? Bye. - Sure, it's clear. What an asshole. # Oh, when the saints... Oh, when the saints... # # Oh, when the saints go marching in! # # Oh, I want to be in that number... Oh, when the saints go marching in! # Helen! Oh, Michael, I cheated on you. I didn't want to drink, but he insisted. I didn't notice anything. Let's go. Come. You're a total drunk. There you go. You'll get over it. It's not true that I cheated on you, at some point he started touching me. I wanted to do it, but his sweaty palms made me sick. It all started by chance. At first, It was a joke, a game... But now she's inside my blood, it's like a drug... ..I can't do without her. Do you think I don't understand, Michael? I'm strong enough to give up on you if you love another girl... ..but not like that, not this way. No, I don't love her. At least, I don't think. I'm just so confused... I don't know what to do. - Hello? - Hello, Michael? - Who's it? - I'm Sarah, don't you recognize me? - I'm tired. - We're almost at the end, by now. We only got a few more nights... ..and we have to spend all of it, every night... ..every second, without exception. In my own way, remember. Are you willing to do anything for me? Sarah, I'd tell you one important thing. I don't want to know anything, Michael, You only have to answer yes or no. And I want the answer now. Yes, In your own way, Sarah. - You don't do this just for the book, right? - Indeed, no. This story doesn't have to be confused with the other, Michael has to go from the book. - Number 100 will be a character just made up. - What are you talking about? Have you lost your mind? Don't you understand? This time I'm got involved in the game. We've gone too far, a man never gave me that much. But that's why the story with Michael is great. - Don't you realize it, Sarah? - Sure, dear. It is for me, but not for him... ..nor for those who read the book. - Are we agree with everything? - Yes. So, you go in and act like it was normal. - Don't be too intrusive. - Yes, I will behave like a good boy. - Whatever happens. - Yes. Ok, ok. - Here. - Ah, thanks. - Wait a few minutes, eh! - Ok. What the fuck are you doing? Go away! - Have you seen? It was him that started it! - Go away, out! Michael! Michael! Good morning, Michael, it's time to wake up. Do you have some breakfast with me? Ah, I would like to say, Michael, that this was our last night. When you exit this house, you'll become a stranger... ..for me you've never existed. Is this a new game, Sarah? 11 nights, you don't remember? By the way, did you have something to do this morning? If I'm right, a girl's waiting for you to get married, isn't she? Ah, yes, I understand. What does it mean? Don't be shocked, you've been good research for my book. ''My 100 men''. I have the press conference in half an hour, I have to hurry. Shower while I finish getting ready. So I'm number 100? Don't worry, I cut out your name from the book. You're not an important one. The 99 other need to be worry about. After all, it's better not giving a name to your character. There's nothing erotic in a man made ridiculous like you. - Don't you think? - So you did it for your filthy book. - You're hurting me! - Why me? Why me? - Because you're so helpless, Michael! The exact opposite of the other, the right one to put down. Leave me alone! - Wait, this story is not ending yet. - Leave me, you're hurting me. - No! - Number 100 wants to write the ending. - No, Michael! - Why not? - No, please! - Stop! - No, Michael, please. - Stop it, I said. - Not like that! No... Please, no. - No... - Stop it! - No... You do not deserve this, even. Goodbye, Sarah. No... I didn't want it to go this way..., Michael. I love you! I love you! I love you! Helen, forgive me.
