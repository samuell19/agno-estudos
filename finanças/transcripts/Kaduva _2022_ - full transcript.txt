[PALA, OF THE 90S] [POLICE STATION, PALA] [DISTRICT JAIL, KOTTAYAM] O' Goddess of Valliyankavu, protect me and this jail. Hey! Come here. What is it, sir? Who is this Kurian, from your home-town? - Kurian? - Yes. Kurian Koruthu. He is coming here today, apparently. Kurian Koruthu? Must be some new kid on the block, sir! What is it? Is it a chain-snatching case or something? It's not a chain-snatching or robbery. It's quite a big game. He has another name in his home-town. A nickname. You might know him by that name. Kuriyaachen. Kaduvakkunnel Kuriyaachen, alias Kaduva (tiger). O' Goddess of Valliyankavu! Kaduva Kuriyaachen Chettan? How did he get arrested? Do you know him? What a question! My dear sir, how will I know that it's him, if you call him Kurian or Koruthu? Kaduva. You should call him Kaduva. Only then can I recognize the person! You should listen to this, sir. Right from me to the little kids in Kudamattam and Pala, Kuriyaachen Chettan is a true hero for all of us. Dressed in a silk shirt, specially sewed from tailor Antony's shop, and a wrinkle-free Chuttikkara Mundu, with a Pindikkurishu rosary, Kuriyaachen Chettan gets down at the Chapel junction from his Benz with the number 123. That's a sight to behold, sir! Does he know you? Well.. I am out of station most of the time, right sir? So it's been many years since we met each other, face-to-face. But he might know me if you tell him my name. Sir! From what Shankaran is saying, the guy who's coming, seems like a VVIP. Let him be, man! It's been a while since such a big shot came here! Yeah. That's true. Hello? Okay, sir. No. I'll handle it, sir. Thank you, sir. Sir... Hey! You were right. The guy who's coming is a VVIP indeed. It was Kadaykkan from Ernakulam on the call. IG Ma than Kadaykkan. He said this guy is very dear to him and that we should make sure that he has no complaints. Didn't I tell you, sir? Though he's a thief, Shankaran won't lie for no reason. Where's this next hassle from? Hello? Sir! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. What happened, sir? Where was the call from? From the South. - From the south? - Yes. From Thiruvananthapuram. IG Joseph Chandy. Three notorious goons are being shifted here from Kottarakkara sub-jail, apparently... and that we should close our eyes to whatever they do here, just for this one day. Oh! That's all? What can they do over here? Who the hell made you a police officer, man? Those guys are coming here from Kottarakkara to attack that Kuriyaachen. Didn't you understand that yet? Oh! Is that how it is? Yes. Whatever their plan is, they will execute it today itself. That's why we were asked to ignore it. Whose side will we take now? Kadaykkan or Joseph? Why do you even have a doubt, sir? We should be on Joseph's side. He wields more power upon our Chief Minister, than even the DGP. You know that, right? Our caps and jobs will disappear before we know it, if we upset him. Don't forget that. I don't want anyone here to see me for the time being. Go and give it, sir. If anyone asks you anything, just say that IG Kadaykkan sir has sent you. Well, err... Don't worry, sir. I'm telling you, right? Go! Well, should I go with him to give him some confidence? No! My name is Varkey. I am an ex-teacher of the Pala Kudamattam Cupertino School. IG Kadaykkan sir had asked me to hand this over to you. What is this? These are some belongings of Kuriyaachen, who's coming here today on remand. Does he smoke only this? That's his habit. What's your relation to him? I had taught him when he was in lower primary. Oh! Great! This is how teachers should be! You may go then, sir. I'll give all this to him when he reaches here. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, yeah! Kuriyaachen's cigar. I hope he gets to smoke it. The one walking in front, is Lopez. Thankasshery Lopez. The guy who's right behind him is "Chakku" (sack) Majeed. The third one is "Pankayam" (OAR) Sunil. There are four or five murder cases in each of their names. This entire gang had been in jail for a while, for stabbing and killing a jeweller in Pandalam. Hey Shankaran! That's a hit job for your Kuriyaachen! A mega hit job! - Huh? Those losers? - Yes! You're saying that because you don't know Kuriyaachen Chettan well enough, sir. They're not going to do anything to him, sir. He is a tiger. A royal, savage Tiger! Brother! Me... Shanka... Brother! Do you recognize me? - Who are you? - I am Shankaran. Kuriyaachen, you're being called inside. Finish that. I'll be here. Ah! Kuriyaachen! Welcome! Please take a seat. It's okay, sir. I'll stand here. I've heard about you earlier, Kuriyaachen. Around 10-20 years back... That you had beaten up the Pala Sub Inspector of that time, Benjamin sir, at the city centre. Is it true? Well... if he behaves indecently with a girl from my class, should I keep calm with my hands tied? But since my father was alive back then, it was swept under the carpet rather discreetly. So you don't have a father now, huh? No, sir. But the dignity of being born to that father, hasn't gone down one bit. It has only grown stronger. Kuriyaachen Chetta... Do you know me? No. I am Shankaran. The son of blacksmith Chathan, who used to stay on the other side of the river. - Thief Shankaran. - Ah! You? You are here now? I heard someone saying recently that you were in Viyoor Jail. It's been a long time since I left Viyoor jail. It wasn't working out for me. I've been here for the past three months. What's the case? It's just a small car theft... from an Advocate's house at Ramapuram. I had come home when Chathan died. But I didn't see you there then. I was in Viyoor then. I had just joined there. So, I couldn't get leave. Why are they bathing at this hour? Are they crazy? Yes. They just got here today. The talk going around here is that they were sent here to attack you. What's up, Kuriyaacha? Wanna take a bath with us? Come, we'll give you a bath! Shall I take a bath, Shankaran? Now? I have to take a bath with them sooner or later anyway. So, let me start with that bath! As you wish, Kuriyaachen Chetta. Come on! We'll give you a bath! Come on! Why not! I'll take a bath! Come on! Come on! Come on! Since it's high noon, the water is really hot. Isn't it? "KADUVA" [TIGER] [A FEW WEEKS AGO] [BISHOP HOUSE, WAYANAD] Bishop, I'm curious. Why are you holding yourself back? Since we have all understood that he has committed a sin, send a letter that he has to be expelled, Bishop. Well, how can you say so? Father is very young, right? So, my opinion is that he should be given another chance. Chance for what, Aviracha? Don't get me started! There's a call for you, Bishop. - Where is it from? - From Thiruvananthapuram. This is Thomachan. Revenue Minister, Thomas Poovampara. Tell me, Thomacha. Well, I just called to remind you that Father Robin is not just an ordinary priest, but my younger brother's son as well. So, when you take a decision, you should have that too in your mind. You should understand my situation as well, Thomachan. Oops. I have called now, after understanding that. I'll solve this problem in a way that no one will mess with you. You just have to stand with me. - How? - There's a way, Bishop. After you hang up, just go there and say what I'm going to tell you now, with your head held high and in a firm voice. Don't talk like a Communist, Father. It's always like that, right? The one who speaks the truth is always branded as a dissident or a Communist. No one needs to start a fight here for this now. I know what has to be done. As per Father Vattassheril's demand, I cannot recommend Father Poovampara's to be removed from clerical state. Instead, I can transfer him to somewhere in the north, like U.P. or Punjab, as a punishment, to serve the Church there. I can't do anything more than that. This is my final decree regarding this issue. Bishop, if that's the case, you needn't transfer Father Poovampara to the North. Instead, you can transfer him to a Parish of my choice. Can you do that? Which Parish? Pala Kudamattom Church. You shouldn't have done this to me and my family, Father. As always, when it's time to make a decision, all you people dressed in whites are always one. At least that bloody priest would have suffered somewhere in the North. Now, you've gotten him a bumper offer. My dear Mathayi... Have you thought of me like that? Do you think that I'll say something like that, without any plan in mind? The punishment he's going to get now, will be much more severe than anything he could possibly get in the North. Wait and watch! Either Poovampara will learn a lesson with this, or he'll leave the priest's post and find some other job. Hey! This Kudamattam Church... is my Kuriyaachen's Parish. I'll give you a letter. You should go to Pala with it, and meet Kuriyaachen. He will handle the rest. ♪ A house where love blossoms, that would put even Eden to shame ♪ ♪ Come on, everyone...

Achaya! Achaya, wake up! What is it? Someone from Wayanad is here to see you. From Wayanad? Wayanad is quite far, right? Ask him to come from somewhere nearby. Achaya! Father Vattassheril has sent him. Father Vattassheril? Kuriyaachen, as you know, I am over 80 years old now. Be it back in the day or now, I've never been able to turn a blind eye to such blights happening in the Parish. Now, when I couldn't think of any other option at the Church Court, the Lord showed me your face. Self-control is the very foundation of Priesthood. One who does not possess self-control, is not fit to be in that position. Mathayichan will give you the rest of the details. Remembering you and your family in my prayers, with love, Father Vattassheril. For around 18 years, me and my family have been serving that Parish, sir. My child went there to clean the clergy house. That's when, that scoundrel... I didn't inform the police, thinking that her life will be ruined. When that rodent Thomas is a Minister, what's the point in complaining to any cop about his brother's son? Father Vattassheril is right. Such rotten scoundrels needn't continue in the Church wearing the robe. You don't worry. Poovampara will be here from next Sunday onwards, right? We'll see. Well, Varkey sir... Why did Father Vattassheril send that scoundrel here? What can Kuriyaachen do to a priest? Back in college, Father Vattassheril used to teach me for my Masters', and him, for his Bachelors'. From his letter, I could sense a deep feeling of resentment, for being helpless. Well, Kuriyaachen... How are we going to operate this? Oh! We needn't do anything. Hereafter, on every Sunday, we have to go to church, without fail. Since wretchedness is in his blood, Poovampara himself will give us a reason to beat him to pulp. And when that happens, we just have to rip him apart. O' people of the Lord... It's my sheer divine luck and good fortune, to have found my favourite musical instrument: The piano here, and to have played it fairly well before you.. Within the first week of me taking charge here. If there are children who'd like to learn the piano in our parish, they can approach me, without any hesitation. For gifting this piano, I express my endless love and gratitude, to Karinkandathil Theruthi and her family. I'd like to remind all of you that... the coming Sunday is Parish Day. On that day, the Bishop will grace our Parish with his presence, and would conduct the holy mass. Wishing you all a wonderful week. Come, Mom. Let's meet the new priest. - Praise be to the Lord. - Praise be! Father, meet my son, Joseph. Inspector General, Joseph Chandy. Of course, I know him. Uncle Thomas keeps talking about him. Chedathi, - thank you once again. - What for? - For giving the piano. - Oh! - Thank you. - Okay. - We'll take your leave. - Shall we? Varkey! - Ousepputti! - See you, son! Chedathi, bye. Father, I am Susan. Meet my husband, Benny. He deals with plantation produce. This is our daughter, Aneeta. When she heard you playing the piano, she had a desire to learn the piano. - Can you teach her, Father? - Why not? I will teach her. You can come to the clergy house, anytime. I will teach you, dear. - Okay? - Yes. Thanks a lot, Father. - We'll take your leave then. - Okay. - Come when you have the time. - Bye, Father. - Bye, man! - Bye! - I am Varkey. - I am Korah. I am a lawyer. Kuriyaachen. I am a planter. Father! If you dare to do anything dirty like what you did to those poor people in Wayanad... in this parish, I won't consider that you are priest. I will burn you alive! Got it? See you, Father. Bye, Father. From Mankoottam Kunjeppu Chettan's house, an organic chicken which was fed only bran and wheat, weighing 2.5 kilos. - 80 Rupees! - Does it really weigh 2.5 kilos, Babu? You can weigh it and see for yourself, Varkey sir! Country eggs! Seven eggs for 21 Rupees! Anyone can buy! 100 Rupees! Plackal Saji, 100 Rupees! Hundred Rupees, going once! - Hundred Rupees, going twice! - 150 Rupees! Somu Kuttiyil, 150 Rupees! - 150 Rupees! - 200 Rupees! Kaduvakkunnel Kuriyaachen Chettan, 200 Rupees! 250 Rupees! Ah! Thalakkottu Victor, 250 Rupees. 250 Rupees, going once! - 250 Rupees, going once! - 300 Rupees! Kuriyaachen Chettan, 300 Rupees! Oh! This is going to take a while. - Come, let's go. - 300 Rupees, going twice! Anyone wants to quote a higher price? - I'm going to seal the deal! - 400 Rupees! Ah! Thalakkottu Victor! Well, isn't this boy's grudge towards Kuriyaachen over yet? No way! He stills thinks that it was Kuriyaachen who separated Kuriyaachen's sister Leena from him. That girl was already in love with that Doctor from Piravom. She got married to him and flew to Ireland. Well, since they grew up together, it's true that she was quite free and comfortable around him. This idiot misinterpreted it as love. What to do! Finally, all the blame fell upon Kuriyaachen. Now, whenever he gets a chance, he's trying to defeat Kuriyaachen, in whichever way he can. Such a shame! - 800 Rupees! - Kuriyaachen Chettan, 800 Rupees! 800 Rupees, going once! 800 Rupees, going once! - 900 Rupees! - Ah! Thalakkottu Victor! 900 Rupees! Anyone to contest him? 900 Rupees! The sale is going to be fixed! Babu, you can give it to him now. Let him make a curry with it. Even though the money goes to the church, I can't digest a chicken that's worth 900 Rupees. 900 Rupees, going once! 900 Rupees, going twice! 900 Rupees, going thrice! - Thalakkottu Victor! - Kuriyaachen! The auction is closed! Hey! Keep it there! Where are you guys taking it? We were asked to take this to the priest's room. - Who? - I told them. That piano was gifted to me, right? So, it should be kept in my room, right? Gifted to you? Who told you so? Theruthi Chedathi gave this to the church. If that's the case, let her say that to me. She will, Father. She will say that. Next Sunday, she will say it in front of the entire Parish. After that, the people here will be calling you by a different name. Until then, let this be in your room. So be it. You do the work that was assigned to you. Come! Yeah, take this as well. Will you be coming with your children next week, Ousepputti? I'll try, Mom. Depends upon my work schedule. If so, have lunch before leaving, son. Mom! What are you saying? We need to visit Uncle Paily at Kottayam, right? Oh no! I forgot about that. Don't waste time then. Get going. Jesus! Kids, give your grandma a kiss! Appu! Aah, Kuriyaachen! Why you are here today...? I just wanted to meet Chedathi. Are you going back to Trivandrum, Ousepputti? Yes. Hello! How come you didn't come to church today? All of us were supposed to come together. But our son was not feeling well in the morning. He is fine now. What is his name? Joel. - And yours, dear? - Jessica. Ah! Ousepputti... I want to tell you something. Please come. Ousepputti... You... You are much more intelligent and worldly-wise than me. In fact, you are the pride of the people of Pala. But... I'm going to tell you something that has been in my mind for a while. You should take it in good sense. What is it, Kuriyaachen? Ousepputti... When money, power and status, come to us at the same time, we may... forget ourselves. We may feel that the entire world is at our feet. But... Whenever I heard many unpleasant things about you, I wanted to say this to you. Kuriyaachen... You came to see my mom, right? Go ahead. She is in the house. Chedathi! What's up, Kuriyaachen? The Advocate is also with you, huh? Sit down! What's the reason for this unusual visit? Oh! I just felt like seeing you. And I'm here! I know that you won't come here without any reason. What's the matter? Well, it's nothing much. I had a small doubt. Did you donate that piano to the church or gift it to Father Poovampara? Gift to the Father? What for? Did he win a running race before coming for the holy mass today, to give him a gift? I donated it to the church. Who has a doubt about that? - You're sure, right? - Yes! So, I'll present this topic in front of the Bishop and the parish next week. Then you should stand up and repeat what you said now. What's the matter? What happened to the piano now? Nothing happened to the piano. That priest shifted it to his room in the clergy house. When we questioned him, he told us that you gifted it to him. Then, I need to settle this. Kuriyaachen, don't you know... about my husband Chandy's craze for music? - Of course! - Yes! He has wasted a lot of money for that too. When that craze peaked, he imported this piano from England on a ship. When it was getting ruined lying here, I thought it'll prove useful for the church choir and gave it to the church. You wait here. Let me go attend that call. - Okay! - Mother Mary! Hello? Ah! Okay. Let me try. Let me try. Kuriyaachen! - Kuriyaachen! - Yes! You should go after Ousepputti immediately on your bike. He must have only crossed Kottaramattam by now. What is it, Chedathi? What happened? It was a call from the Chief Minister's office in Thiruvananthapuram. A riot has broken out at some coastal village over there, apparently. Joseph has been asked to reach Thiruvananthapuram immediately. But he's planning to drop by at my brother's place in Kottayam. Go, stop him and ask him to head straight to Thiruvananthapuram. Leave quickly! My boy might lose his job! Don't worry, Chedathi. We will go. - Come, Korah! - Dear Lord! Let me call my brother in Kottayam. Chedathi, don't forget what I told you! Don't worry about that, Kuriyaachen! Look! If this Karinkandathil Chandikkunju is the father of my three children, I will come to the church next week, and say the truth! - Fine? - That's enough! That's more than enough. We will handle this. Kuriyaachen! He has ruined my day. Rascal! What happened, Joseph? No, it's nothing. There he goes! Hey! Stop! Ousepputti! Didn't he hear you? That's Kuriyaachen, right? Slow down! Why are you speeding, Joseph? Hey! Hey! Stop! Chase him, man! Stop in front his car. Ousepputti! Chedathi sent me. You should head straight to Thiruvananthapuram, instead of dropping by at Kottayam. A riot has broken out in some coastal village there, apparently. You may leave. I know what to do. Move your vehicle. Sir! Sofia! What's the update? Now it's not in our control, sir. The riot is spreading. We have fired three rounds already, sir. Yet, they are not ready to disperse. Where did you fire at? To the sky, sir. Useless! You shouldn't be firing at the sky. You should fire right on to their chests. - Bloody criminals! - But sir! We have strict orders from the DGP's office not to take any action, no matter how much the mob provokes us. Shucks! This is my order! Whatever happens due to this, it's my responsibility. Get ready! Take positions! [SLOGANS DEMANDING IG JOSEPH'S ARREST] CM, are you going to let him continue being unbridled like this? Sir, you are our Home Minister, as well. The Opposition is accusing that this guy has hijacked you and our entire police force. Whatever said and done, we are answerable to the public... for the four lives that were lost in Valiya Thura. That's right. Or else, it would tarnish the image of this entire Ministry. Hey! You are all just demoralizing a dedicated Police officer. Mind you! So what if four guys died? The riot stopped, right? Or else, all of them would have burnt the state itself. My opinion is the same as Mr. Thomas. In that situation, what Joseph Chandy did was the right step to end up the riot. That's what I feel. Or else, the riot would have spread to other areas, and things would have gone out of control. Yes. Without suspending IG Joseph Chandy from the service, we will declare a judicial inquiry. That will be the best way to handle this issue, without any damage to both sides. As the second biggest party in this cabinet, me and my party completely support the Honourable CM's decision. Okay, then. See you! You're still here? Yes, sir. Aunt Theruthi is fine, right? Yes, sir. Sir, thank you so much... for supporting me. That's not such a big deal, man. When something untoward happens to Karinkandathil Chandy's son, Poovampara Thomas cannot watch on with his hands tied, right? Don't worry, man! - We are with you! - Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Praise be to the father, the son and the holy spirit. Bishop! I wanted to bring something to your attention. What is it? Last Sunday, Karinkandathil Theruthi Chedathi had given a piano to the church. After the church dispersed, Father Poovampara shifted it to his room in the clergy house. When I questioned him, he said that Chedathi had gifted it to him. We need to get some clarity if that is true or not. Not me, but the one who gifted the piano should be answering this. Chedathi! We need some clarity about this. Bishop! I... Errr... That piano... I didn't donate that piano to the church. I gifted it to the priest. Hey Kuriyaachen... What's your problem? Your father Koruthu Moplah also had the same problem. He was always looking for a reason to start a fight with the church and the priests. If you're planning to go your father's way, you will suffer. Understood? To survive in this parish, you will really suffer. - In this parish... - Hey! No! Don't! So... what say, Chedathi? Shall we confirm it? As you said... shall we confirm that the three of your sons, including this Joseph were not born to Karinkandathil Chandichayan? You!! What did you just say? Bloody scoundrel! Will you shoot? Then go ahead! Without the cap on your head and the back-up of two battalions of police, have you ever fired a gun earlier, Ousepputti? I'm saying this standing in front of your gun. If Karinkandathil Chandikkunju is indeed your father, shoot me! Joseph, no! Joseph, don't do it. - Ousepputti! - Mom! Mom! Mom! What happened, Mom? - What happened? - Get inside. Get into the car. Get in, Mom. Get in through the other side, dear. Mom! Mom! Mom! You are fine, Mom! Kuriyaachen! Mark this date and time! You will realize in the coming days... that this was the... most cursed moment in your life. What you did today was a little too much, Kuriyaachen. Even if he had shot you today outside the church, nothing would have happened to him. He is that powerful... in the ministry and in the police force. Don't laugh it off, Kuriyaachen. Wait and watch! He will rest only after he destroys you. Well... Sorry! - I didn't mean it that way. - Forget it, Rajeevan sir. We'll take it as it comes. But whatever said and done, he spoke very indecently to Theruthi Chedathi today. Isn't she as old as your mother? Varkey sir! Even after knowing everything, don't... What did I know? Did I know that you'd speak lewdly to that woman? Huh? Elsa, you tell me. You're also a woman, right? Do you think what your husband did was right? No. You shouldn't have spoken like that to her, Achaya. You should meet her and apologize to her. What are you saying, Elsa? You shut up! You're out of your senses! What's wrong with you? Kuriyaachen! I had taught you in primary school. So, you must listen to me. As Elsa said, you should apologize to Theruthi Chedathi. I will apologize. That's because I have realized my mistake... and not because I'm scared of her son's influence. When I apologize to her, she should understand that, as well. What is it, Varkey? Shall we come in there and talk, Chedathi? You! Just you! Chedathi, what happened outside the church today, should not have happened. You should forget that. You should also tell Ousepputti, not to take all of it to heart. Will you forget it? If you were in my Ousepputti's position, will you forget it? Huh? What he told me today... No son with self-respect... will be able to forget that. Kuriyaachen regrets it, Chedathi. He has come here to apologize to you. He said that in a sudden fit of rage, when you changed your word. If I have changed my word, I have my own reasons for it. What reason? To please Minister Thomas, your son played a game. - That's the reason! - If you think so, so be it. What can you guys do about it? And Varkey, what he feels now, is not regret. It's fear! The fear that he has messed with IG Joseph Chandy who's ruling this state, and his mother. Even if I forgive him, my son will never forgive him. Look! Do you see that shrine there? I have seen my son standing in front of that picture with his eyes welled up, only twice in my life. Once, when his father committed suicide after being neck deep in debts. Back then, he made a vow standing before that shrine. That he won't allow this family to be ruined, and that he won't let his mother and brothers be stranded on the streets. My child fulfilled that promise! Like that, he made a vow today as well, Varkey. That he'll wreak havoc Kaduvakkunnel Kuriyaachen's life. My son will do that! We're not worried about that, Chedathi. Especially, Kuriyaachen. I felt that what he did to you today, was wrong. As someone who had taught them in school, I pointed out that mistake to him. He admitted his mistake. And he came here to apologize to you. And you're trying to scare us with your son's vows? The one who's standing there, is Kaduvakkunnel Koruthu Moplah's son. The son of Koruthu Moplah, who took up arms against Diwan CP at Koottikkal forest, when he was just 19. Both the mother and son shouldn't forget that when you make vows. Come on, boys. Did that cure your itch? Almost! If you hadn't said that punch-line while leaving, I'd have had to take the blame for beating up my teacher, as well. What happened to all of you? I've been noticing for a while. Hey Chackochan! What is it? Will anyone hurt you, Papa? Who? What will they do? Are you the one... who scared them by saying all these lies? Three of you, get up and come here. Come and stand on either side of Papa. Come on! Listen! As long as you guys are with me as my guardian angels, can anyone do anything to Papa? Forget that, can they even get close to Papa? Huh? Really? Of course! Ah! Why are you here at this hour, Manmadhan sir? Kuriyaachen, Joseph has begun his game. He has transferred all the policemen of Pala police station, right from me to the guard, with immediate effect. He has done this because he knows that we're all close to you. Forget that. Transfers and suspensions are nothing new for policemen. But I was actually shocked when I saw the list of cops who are replacing us. In my place, it's going to be SI Dominic Benjamin. Do you know who he is? The son of Benjamin sir, whom you thrashed to pulp, long back. Dominic is much more of a scoundrel, compared to his father. Along with him, there are many others from the reserve camp, who would dare to do anything. You should be careful. Before you leave, I need to meet all the officers, Manmadhan sir. Get going, sir. - I will come to the police station. - Okay. See! Everyone is ready. As soon as they come and take charge, we will have to leave. I have caused this inconvenience for all of you. Right, Shashiyetta? No way. This is usual for policemen. But you should be careful, sir. The guys who are coming, are a bunch of rogues. - Namaste! - Ah! Namaste, Manmadhan sir. I am Dominic. Dominic Benjamin. I know. We were about to leave once you arrive. Okay then. Who is he? Is he a complainant? Or an accused? Neither. He's a friend of ours. Kuriyaachen. Oh! So, you are "Kunuvachan"? Is your dad doing good? Benjamin sir. Yeah, he's doing very good. When he heard that I was being transferred here, he felt even better. He was extremely happy. See you then, Manmadhan sir. Well, doesn't this property belong to that family settled in America? Have they sold it? I don't know. They had no plans to sell it, even when I asked them recently. Hello, sir. Has this property been sold? Yes. The IG Of Karinkandathil family has bought it. - Joseph Chandy sir. - Huh? Joseph? [SITE FOR PUBLIC CREMATORIUM] This is atrocious. Kuriyaachen, we must get a stay order from the court. What for? It's better to be the neighbour of dead people, than these scumbags who are alive. Try to find a good one, Advocate. Let's inaugurate it ourselves! Hey! You still owe me money from the previous game. Take it from Kuriyaachen. Hello? A cemetery right outside your house is indeed a bad omen. - Of course. - Korah! Try to get a stay order somehow. I can get it easily. What can I do if he doesn't agree? - He will agree. You do the needful. - Kuriyaachen sir... We got a call saying that there's a fight happening in your bar. You've been asked to go there immediately. Those guys started the fight, Kuriyaachen Chetta. What do you guys want? Move away, you rascals. Move, I said! Bloody "Kanuvakkunnel" bar! When you try to mess with someone, you should mess with your kind. Otherwise, this is what happens! Did you hear that, ...bloody dog? Start the vehicle! Come quickly. Your van is here. Kunjumol, be a good girl and eat your lunch fully, okay? Good morning! My darling girl! Are you leaving already? Of course. I can reach there before noon only if I start now. You could have taken Varkey sir or Korah along, instead of going alone. What for? What is it? Are you scared? No. If possible, come back tomorrow itself. Won't you call once you reach? I will. It's been three weeks since I went to the plantation. And next week is the harvesting. I wonder what the situation must be, now. We need to search this house. We have a warrant. Check over there. What is this, Peter? Most of these are unripe. The harvesting is next week, right sir? So, some of them will be unripe. Keep this in our vehicle. - Hello? - Achaya! The cops have stormed into the house. They are searching the entire house. When I ask them for the reason, they aren't saying anything. There's something wrong. Please come here quickly. Didn't I ask you not to touch the phone? Huh? Hang up and get lost, man! Please move! Come on, step aside. Hey! Move away! Sir, we are Kuriyaachen's friends. You should let us go inside. Even if you are Kuriyaachen's daddy, we won't let you go inside. Move away! - Move away. - Let go of my hand! Take them away! Move away! Didn't we tell you that we must go inside? Move away! - No! - Let go of me! Varkey sir! Sir, don't hit me! How dare you touch a policeman? Hey! Take him! - Put him in the jeep. - What are you doing? - Let go of my hand! - Let them go! Please don't hurt them! Sir, please! Shove him inside! Tessa! Chacko! Chacko, come here. Chacko, come with me. - Son.. - Mom! Kunjumol... Come inside. Let go of me! - What's happening? - No, sir. It's not in the house. We need to search this vehicle, SIR! Why not! Go ahead! You need to open this. It's not locked. Where is its licence? It's inside the same briefcase. Well, SIR... This gun's licence was cancelled by the Kottayam district collector, two days back. I wasn't informed about that, sir. That's none of our concern. So, for possessing a weapon without a licence, we are arresting you, SIR. So be it. Now you may get into our jeep, SIR. Not so easily. We've been asked to take you there, after beating you to pulp. So, please co-operate with us, SIR. Definitely, sir. I will co-operate! Dominic sir! I don't know if this is what you meant by beating to pulp. But I have thrashed them to the best of my ability. Let me know if this is not good enough. So, the real game is yet to begin! Right, Kuriyaachen Chetta? No, Shankaran. What happened so far was the game. What's going to happen hereafter, ...is a war! A war that will end only if one of us falls. [EXCISE COMMISSIONER] Our bar licence has been revoked.

[DISTRICT JAIL, KOTTAYAM] Kuriyaachen is being summoned by the IG. Inspector General. IG Joseph Chandy sir. Ah! Kuriyaachen! How are you? Hope you are doing good. I had to come here... on an official visit. So, I thought I'll meet you before I go. Does the news from your home-town reach you while you're here, Kuriyaachen? You and your family... have become the talk of the town now. And, by the way... You're not the same old Kuriyaachen any more. You have around 20 cases in your name, including spirit smuggling. Your bar licence has been revoked. You'll lose your export licence too, very soon. Well, that's what I heard. Acres of your cardamom plantation... ...were set on fire. And... SI Dominic is always in your house. I heard that he dug up even the foundation stone of your house, the other day. And... I heard that your elder daughter ...had some serious accident I don't know what happened. But... something has happened, for sure. - Hey! - No! Sir! - Hello? - Elsa, it's me. - What happened to Tessa? - Hello? Hello, Achaya? Where are you calling from? Elsa, tell me the truth. What happened to Tessa? No, Achaya. There's nothing to worry. I swear, Achaya. She slipped while going down the staircase. There's a slight fracture on her leg. That's all. If you don't believe me, she's in the room. - I'll put her on. - Yeah, do that. Hello? H... Enough! It's the Government's money. So, when your own blood is hurt, it will sting you too! Isn't it? Ousepputti... have you read Obadiah's book in the Bible? If not, you should read it today itself. Whatever I have to tell you, is written in it. Clearly! The book of Obadiah. As you have done, it shall be done to you. Your deeds... will return upon your own head. The pride of your heart... has deceived you. Though you soar like the eagle... and make your nest among the stars, from there... I will bring you down! [INTERVAL] By the way, Kuriyaachen sir... For the time being, I'm not going to send anyone to cell no. 13, where you were kept. There are plenty of cases in your name, right? What if you have to come back immediately after being released? Thanks a lot, sir. Sir, just a minute. I'm saying this out of concern. Try to solve your issues with IG sir, somehow. Or else, he will destroy you. [JAIL SUPERINTENDENT] See you! Bye! Ah, Kuriyaachen! - When did you reach? - Half an hour back. Really? Elsa really wanted to come with us. But we didn't allow her. That's good. For everyone to come and receive me, I'm not returning from the Middle East, right? That's right. You guys carry on then. I have to go to the Ashram... and meet Father Kariyattil. What the hell is this, Varkey sir? Why did we come here then? Bring it this side. - Raise it! - Come on, lift it up! Bring it to the right! Varkey sir! Didn't he say when he would come here? No! As soon as the Ashram's van arrived, he got into it and left. Come on! Come on! Sir, do you want a Beedi? No, man. I'm on duty, right? More towards the right. Come on! Continue! To the right! Bring it down! Yeah, that's enough! Let it stay like that. When he comes back, he should see this first. His father dangling between the sky and the earth. See, Korah! The kind of ideas they are coming up with, to lock Kuriyaachen. I think it was in 1978 or 79, when Koruthu Moplah went to a workshop in Coimbatore to fix an AC in the car, and got a Matador engine fixed in the car. They dug up that trivial fact, and have now framed a false case, right? Well, I heard that Kuriyaachen will be released on bail today. - Didn't he reach yet? - I don't think so. Had he arrived, the whole ballgame would have changed. If their children are troublemakers, the ancestors can't find peace even in their graves. I've heard wise men saying so. In your father's case, that has come true. Dominic... I'm asking you again! Is Benjamin sir doing good? How dare you swear at my father, you dog! I've not just sworn at your dad. When this whole town was watching, I have beaten up your dad like a dog! So, will your rancour... be over with this? Varkey sir! We'll meet later. I'm really tired. Oh! So be it! We just came here to say that we had come to the prison in the morning. That's all! That's all! Come, Korah! Come on! Come, I said! Where are the children? Tessa is inside. She is lying down. Chackochan and Kunjumol have gone to school. Papa! Papa! What is it? What happened to you? Papa... I... Didn't I tell you, Achaya? She slipped while coming down the staircase. - Elsa! - Yes! Get me something to drink. I'm really thirsty. Okay. Papa... I'll tell you what happened. But you should promise me, that you won't cause any trouble because of this. I can't imagine you going to jail once again. It must have been one week back, Papa. I didn't go to school that day, since I was down with fever. Didn't you recognize me, Elsamma? I am Robin. Robin Poovampara. Get out from my house, you perverted priest! Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Mom! Move away! Let go of my mother! Mom! Move away! Mom! Oh, no! My dear! Mom! Mom! Oh no! Dear! Tessa, dear! What happened? Get out of my house, you dog! Get up! Get lost! Papa! You promised me! You told him? Tessa, do you want to send your Papa to jail again? Didn't I tell you not to tell him anything? Elsa! Don't worry, dear. I won't create any trouble. Trust me. Papa! Kunjumol! Chackocha! Will you leave us and go again? What a question! I'm not going anywhere! Got it? Have the children slept? Yes. What are you thinking about? You've been sitting like this for a long time now. It's nothing. Ever since we lost the bar licence and export licence, our income has really gone down. We need a huge amount to fight the case itself. Don't worry about all that now. Listen! Everything will be alright. Come on, go to bed. - Hey! - Yes! Are you angry with me? What for? Well, the reason for all these problems... was my hasty behaviour. Do you feel so? What's wrong with you? Just stop it! And yeah, if I tell you something, you shouldn't say no to it. Tell me. Tomorrow morning, you should go to Victor's house and meet him. He sent a complaint to the Chief Minister for us. For that, the cops framed him in a false case, and beat him to pulp. You should go. I will go. I've only heard about people smashing someone's eardrums. Now we've experienced that too. Anyway, you felt like coming here at least for this, right? If I make some coffee, will you have it? What a question, Chedathi. Not just coffee. Get me something to eat, as well. Shall I get you some tapioca and beef curry then? That'd be awesome. Bring it quickly. I'm hungry! Come, dear. Got royally thrashed, huh? Not for you. I intervened in this, feeling bad for your wife and children. Let that be. It's true that you deserved a pounding. But this was a bit too much. Who hit you? Was it Dominic? Hey! - Where is he? - Oh, no! What is it, sir? Take him! - Oh, no! My son! - Come on! - Please don't hurt my son, sir. - Move away! - What is it, sir? What's the matter? - Move away! Come here, you... - Please don't hurt him. - Don't move! - Tell me! - Don't hurt my son! Move away! Come on! So, you'll send a complaint against a cop to the Chief Minister, huh? You want to mess with me? Huh? Will you do it again? Tell me! I will put an end to your love for your neighbours! You will collect signatures from the villagers, huh? I will end the love for your neighbours! You want more? Forget it, man! Don't worry.

Of course. Not just one or two. There are 22 criminal cases against me. Wait and watch! The best advocates in India... are going to fight these cases for me. I don't know if all this would be enough for that. I heard that the plantations at Cumbum and Kumily have been sold. The house where he's staying, and the sealed bar in Pala... Some buyers have quoted prices for them. Altogether, the value of the assets would be around 30 Crores, right? Of course! Well, Itthaakk... After selling all this, where is Kuriyaachen going to go? I heard that he's shifting to Malabar. He can't move until the case is over. He'll be in deep trouble. I never thought Kuriyaachen would turn out to be such a coward. Hey Jomon! Have you ever been in jail? No, right? That's why you think so. You don't have to spend too many days. Just one night is enough. Any big shot will shrink... Shrink like a leech! Varkey sir, come here. Looks like we'll have a solution for everything today. Look! He made way for the cop! If it was the old Kuriyaachen, would he do so? He's petrified now, man! - May I come in, sir? - Yes! - Sir! - Congratulations... ...to the youngest ADGP in the State. Sir? The new list has your name, as well. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much! There might be grouses from many quarters. Who cares! You needn't, too. Yes, sir. - Hello? - Chedathi, is Varkey sir home? Yes, he is here. I will call him. Varkeychaya! Call for you! - Who is it? - It's Kuriyaachen. - Yeah, tell me. - I need to meet you. I will be home till noon. I have to go to the block office after that. You can go wherever the hell you want to. But at 10 AM tomorrow, I need you to be at the club! Yeah, slowly! There's slush over there. Hey! Has Kuriyaachen come here? He's in the room, sir. Welcome, welcome! Fix your drinks! - That's a good idea. - No! We don't need it. Tell me why you called us. Sit down. I'll tell you. Sit down. Namaste. If the current rumours are true, we're going to witness a completely unexpected political situation... hitherto unseen in Kerala politics. Our representative PR Gopan joins us on the telephone line, from the Cliff House, to explain about the situation. Gopan, are we hearing the truth? What's the political drama that's ongoing at Cliff House right now? Abhilal, like you said, the Cliff House is being witness to completely unexpected and dramatic incidents now. Though he has two more years left to complete his term, Chief Minster Ananthanadhan is about to leave for Raj Bhavan to submit his resignation right now. That's the latest news we have received. Even the closest circles of the Chief Minister have no clue, as to what coup led the Chief Minister to take this decision. We tried to contact several leaders of the constituent parties. But none of them were ready to respond to us. So, if we have to get any clarity regarding this, it will definitely be from Chief Minister, Ananthanadhan. CM, though you have a clear majority, this is a completely unexpected decision. This is unexpected for you. As far as I am concerned, I had decided this as soon as I came into power. If the party has to grow, youngsters have to be attracted to the party. By youngsters, whom do you mean? The High Command has to decide all that. I won't suggest anyone's name myself. I just expressed my concern over this matter. Okay then. We will talk further, once I meet the Governor. Hey! Tell me the truth. Are you behind this? But how did you? Tell us clearly, Kuriyaachen! Varkey sir... Korah... A powerful king's army and commander will be as powerful as him. But... if the King falls, the army will be shattered. The Commander's confidence and arrogance will come to an end... and he will become weak. But for that, the King has to be brought down first. Brother! - Kuriyaachen Chettan, right? - Yes. I am Sunny. Maalam Sunny. I was your sister Leena's classmate. I'm into politics now. I got betrayed by my own party and ended up here. Feud between the groups, you know! Wait and watch, bro. We won't let him complete his term of five years. Chief Minister Ananthanadhan! Like he trapped me in a false case, he is hunting down every credible worker in our group. We will hit back, Chetta. I'll tell you a top-secret. Don't tell anyone else. The complete evidence of 12 corruption cases... that Ananthanadhan has committed in the past three years, including the Palm Oil deal... is with our leaders. By our leaders, I mean Francis Paul sir and Kunjithomman sir. If they reveal it, then both this Government... and this party will be a thing of the past! But we cannot destroy the party, just like that. That'd be like chopping the branch we're sitting on. But we'll present all this evidence in front of the other parties in the alliance. Then we'll ask for a change in the leadership. If they don't agree, we'll threaten them. The ones who still don't agree? We'll purchase them with the price they quote, and bring them with us. But.. For that, we need a sponsor. A sponsor who's not scared of Ananthanadhan; Someone who can spend money for us, trusting us. As soon as we find someone like that, we will bring down Ananthanadhan, Chetta. Am I okay? You? Yes, me. Will that be okay? MLA Francis Paul and Kunjithomman have sent me here, upon Sunny's request. [NIRMALA GIRI ASHRAM] The weapons are all ready here. What we need now, is the support of someone like you. Look! A bribe of Rs. 3 Crores, for the import of palm oil, from a Malaysian company. Fund... I'm ready to fund you. Twelve Crores! For the ones who support us, for the ones whom we have to bring in, and for the ones who may betray us, we'd have to spend that much. To arrange the cash, I will get some time, right? Well, not much. Two months, at the most. And... this attempt may fail at any stage. Ananthanadhan is aware of it. If something like that happens, forget the money that you had spent until then. That means, we don't have any assurance for the money you're going to spend. Think really well and then tell us your decision. My dear brothers and sisters, we need to know what we are doing. "Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord, ' shall enter the kingdom of heaven Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. He who does the will of my Father who is in heaven, "shall enter the kingdom of heaven" Ten days back, I handed over the entire amount to Kunjithomman and Francis Paul. They kept their promise. Exactly on the tenth day, Ananthanadhan's ministry has collapsed. I haven't even told Elsa about any of this. That's why... I had to keep some distance from you guys as well. Hey! That's alright. You did the right thing. You are a real man! A real man, from this land of Pala! The most important moment in Kerala's political history has happened now. The resignation of Kerala's 15th Chief Minister, Mr. Ananthanadhan, has been accepted by the Governor. [NEWS CONTINUES] Now, you guys have some drinks and relax. I have to head out now. Where are you going? My real game begins only now, Varkey sir. I had postponed so many things. I have to finish all that, one by one! Only once in his life, has HE taken a weapon in hand! That was to chase wretched scoundrels like you, away from places like this. On HIS behalf, I am doing that now. I, MC Kunjithomman, do swear in the name of God, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as a Minister of the State of Kerala, and that I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will Hey Kuriyaachen! Okay! I'll meet you all, later in the evening. Recognized me? Oh, wow! Which adult of this state doesn't know you, sir? So, you're playing the big game, is it? If I play, I always play the big game, sir. You sold half your assets and brought down the ministry. You beat up my boy and dumped him in the church well. This will all be over soon. Then, we need to meet each other. Why not! We will definitely meet! Just let me know, sir. I will be at Pala. Here you go! The first order signed by the 16th Chief Minister of Kerala. So, let's start like this, right? That's good. This is an amazing start! This should reach there immediately, via a special messenger. Don't hand it over to someone else if he is not present there. Wait until he comes and hand this over to him, in person. Yes, sir. Sir... Thank you, sir. This Government has temporarily frozen your promotion, as multiple allegations against you are currently under investigation. Till the time all such allegations have been cleared, you are transferred to the metal industries and relieved of all law and order duties, with immediate effect. Isn't that... the content of the order? The greatest fortune that came to you, at the age of 47. The second in command of Kerala Police. That will now... remain a dream that's forever out of your reach, Ousepputti. Power! The power you were wielding till date, with utmost arrogance. You're going to watch with folded hands, how you're going to lose all of it, one by one. Didn't I tell you, "As you have done, it shall be done to you." That begins right here, right now. So, due to a piano that Karinkandathil Theruthi Chedathi donated to Kudamattam church, a whole ministry was brought down. Right, Kuriyaachen? Ah! It can be interpreted that way, as well. Stop! Stop! Pull over. Pull over, man. Aha! Since it's the end of the month, Dominic is desperately trying to get some bribes. Well, didn't he hear about the change in the ministry? Or... does it not apply to him? If he doesn't know about the change in rule, he should realize it, right here, right now. He should realize that he's the one who's going to be affected the most, because of it. Victor! I'm going to beat him up right now, in the middle of the road. I'll give you a golden chance. The first blow... should be yours! Do you dare? If you do, go ahead! Ah! It's you? Are you back on two legs now? What's that thing fixed on your ear? Looks nice! You seem to be quite agitated! What is it? What? What you got that day was not enough? Huh? No way! I think it was more than required. So, I thought I'll return some of it today. Great job! Good shot! Victor! The offer for you is closed! Now, you can... watch the game, standing there. Go on! Beat up these scoundrels to death! Hey! Wait! Wait! Where are you going? Follow your superior's order! Go! Go! Trying to run away? Victor! Shall we start the car and switch on the AC? That's a good idea. Korah, ask him to stop it. He has been holding his rage back for quite a while, sir. Let him enjoy venting it out. Your father, Benjamin sir was so much better than you! After all, during his old age, he made me chase him for 5 kilometres, being beaten up twice as much as you now. But you're just bringing shame to your father! And yeah, I don't care whether you crawl or swim! Bring it back to my porch before dawn tomorrow. My father's Ambassador car that you seized, to vent your frustration! The documents for which, would have reached your table by now. - Who is it? - It's IG Joseph Chandy sir. Oh! Hello? Yeah, I saw it just now. You come here. I need to tell you certain things. Okay. [Leaders of the alliance have been summoned to Delhi again] Justice Abdul Lathif. Kunjithomman's most trusted man, MP Moosakkutty's distant relative. So, you know how things are going to roll, right? Even if we don't get any help, there won't be any dearth for troubles. See to it that there's no evidence against you. Those who have to be locked, should be locked. Those who need to vanish, should vanish. Don't hesitate to do any of that. I asked you to come here, to tell you something else, as well. What is it, sir? There's a high chance that they would make an immediate move against me. How, sir? I don't know. Maybe, a raid Or something else. If a raid happens here at my residence and in my office now, that will affect me adversely. There's enough evidence to incriminate me, at both these places. So, they need to be shifted from here, immediately. If it's okay for you, we can shift it to my plantation in Anakkara. Yeah! But taking it so far... Isn't it risky? I'll take it there myself. Okay. Hello? Is it Sunny? - This is Pushkaran. - Yes, Pushkaran. Tell me. - Okay. - Bye, sir. Sir, we're from the vigilance department. We need to search your vehicle. We have a warrant. Here you go. Before I sign this, I'm asking you one last time. Can't you just reveal the true owner of the seized cash and gold and save your own skin? Or else, you will also be finished, just like that old man. No, sir. It's mine. I don't have... anything more to say. Loyalty, huh? Joseph, don't you want to come back to law and order? Don't you want to revive your frozen ADGP promotion order? Or... is your loyalty to Ananthanadhan above all that? Yes. It is much above all that. So, I'm sorry, sir. [PROCESSION FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CHURCH FESTIVAL] I'm aware of whatever you have been doing outside. I wanted to see how far you would go. That's why, I didn't intervene so far. But now, two prominent members of the Parish have been affected because of you. IG Joseph Chandy... and Finance Minister, Thomas Poovampara. So, you better end this right now. Stop it. Or else, the Church will have to intervene. Why are you laughing? - Are you mocking me? - Oh, no! No, Bishop! You're throwing this attitude, with the support of certain people. I know who they are. I just have to pick up this phone and dial to Trivandrum. He will be here the very next minute. Your Chief Minister, Kunjithomman. And he'll be on his knees here. Do you want to see that? I didn't do all that, to solve everything cordially. But then, you have so much disdain! The same arrogance that your father had. Right? You are right, Bishop! I have many such problems that my father had. You don't mind that, Bishop! It's because I was born to a good father. Hey! Whenever you get a chance, you remember my father with fear and envy. I've noticed that. Back when you were the Vicar at Peruvanthanam church, my dad had slapped you hard, when there was an issue regarding the cemetery, right? That's the quality of my father's slap. No one forgets that heat, until they die. When the big shots of the Parish are in trouble, you are fuming in anger. I was also in jail for 14 days. I didn't see anyone dressed in white back then, as a mediator. Bishop, I prefer the old testament... to the new testament of the Bible. "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" I prefer the old testament that says so. Before you try to be a mediator, you should remember that, as well. Aren't you coming, Varkey sir? Well, after kissing his hand...? That's good! Kiss his hand! All that's fine, man! If everything goes well, that will happen as per plan. Okay? Ah! Namaste, sir. Namaste, sir. Namaste, Ji. Namaste. I'll come straight to the point. Rao Ji is really distressed hearing about this group clash of yours. In the upcoming elections, if you both don't support each other, Rao Ji thinks that all our work so far, will be in vain. That's why Rao Ji has sent me, to alleviate the stressful atmosphere here. And to maintain the friendship. Rao Ji has devised a formula for that, as well. What formula? Ananthanadhan ji won't continue in Kerala Politics any more. Rao Ji has invited him back to Delhi. He's going to get a deserving position in the Central Cabinet, as well. Now, the two of you will have to handle Kerala. Together! Huh? Ananthanadhan ji is ready to agree to this formula, with certain conditions. Those who are with me should not suffer. Be it in the party or in the cabinet, they should get deserving portfolios. In the ministry expansion that's going to happen soon, four ministers should be from my group. I will specify the sections later. That's not a problem at all. We won't cause any trouble to you or your people hereafter. - That's our promise. - Yes. Only if all that happens, would I take a flight to Delhi. Or else, I'll still be around! The next condition is personal. What are your terms with that Kuriyaachen from Pala now? In the game that happened prior to this, he's the only card that remained on the table. - That's why I asked. - Oh, no! What's between us? He had agreed to fund us then, and we agreed. When we came into rule, we kept our promise to him. Apart from that, we don't have any lifetime commitment towards him. I know that you don't have that to anyone. Let that be. In the coming days, certain things will unfold in Pala. When they happen and after that, neither you or your police should intervene in it. Well, of course! As you wish, sir! Hey! I'm asking you again! [ARPITHAM MENTAL ASYLUM] Is this necessary? First of all, he is a born criminal. On top of that, he has bipolar disorder. That too, in its extreme level. Giving him such a hit job is like... He won't show any mercy. He shouldn't show any mercy, Paulachan. I came here to meet him today leaving everything aside, because I know that very well. Only he can do this job perfectly. So, I need him! Paulachan... Haven't you seen dogs being plastered on to the roads after being run over by a vehicle? Kuriyaachen should lie dead like that, and I want the entire town of Pala to see it. Look who's here! IG sir? You left after leaving me in this cell, right?? I haven't seen you here after that. How come you decided to pay me a visit now? I saw someone, the other day. Someone who's very dear to you. Someone for whom you and your gang searched the whole world, but could never find. I came here to inform you about that. Who is it? Is it Mary, sir? Yes. Mary, indeed. Changing her name, house and town, she's living a happy life at some other place now. Where is she now? I need to see her, sir. I need to meet her. Calm down, man! I will take you to her. But before that, you should accept a hit job for me. And you should do it, like it is your best job ever, for me. - Can you do it? - Sir! Show her to me first, sir. I'll do whatever you want, after that. Don't you trust me? Then, I will come here tomorrow, to take you with me. First we'll go and meet Mary. From there, straight to Pala. And then, Podiyan, Abu and Na ray an an should also be with you. Your full gang! They will be with me, sir. All of them will be with me. It's the Rakkuli Festival at Pala tomorrow.

Varkey sir! - Sir! - Hey you! Achaya! Stay here, dear. Don't go anywhere else. Watch them! - Achaya! - Mom! Korah! - Come on! - No! No! Go, Elsa! Leave with the kids, I said! Varkey sir! Victor! Kuriyaachen! Rajeevan sir! Take them to the hospital immediately. Take them to the hospital immediately! Varkey sir! Oh no! Get up! Rip him apart! Ousepputti! I'm ending this here, for the time being. The rest... you can decide! Unaccounted money and gold were seized by vigilance officials... from the vehicle of senior IPS officer, Joseph Chandy. This fact aggravates the seriousness of this case. Using his influence over the power centres, the accused may sabotage the investigation. The court cannot ignore this possibility. Hence, in this stage of the case, finding that the accused does not have the right to bail, the court orders the accused to be remanded for fourteen days. Sir, someone is here asking for an appointment, saying that Kuriyaachen from Pala has sent him. Ask him to come. Though I don't have it towards you, you should have it towards me... A lifetime commitment! Yours sincerely, your own Kuriyaachen! Ousepputti! So finally, you have also reached here, right? Yes. But... don't think anything is over yet. Oh no! I don't have any such thoughts! We know... that this is just a short break. You'll take a break inside the jail, and we'll take a break, outside. And by the way, cell no. 13. The Superintendent has left that cell vacant for me. Tell him that you have my recommendation. He will give it to you. Inside that cell, there will be a cool breeze from the east, and mosquitoes won't trouble you much, either.
