OK, Hendrix Because the work is masterful in its execution. - Welcome to year ten. - Thank you Hello. - Great Fantastic. - Hi there. Have some paperwork for you to look over - I want it centred on that wall. - Right, OK.

Don't do it, sir. Right there. Graffiti is one of the oldest art forms. You have to master the technique of the spray can just as you have to do with chalk. And I think we have a few minutes left. Before we finish, I know that Mr Tulloch has something very special to show us. Oh, yes This is something which I've borrowed to show you. This is by an artist you may have heard of. His name is Rembrandt. This is a This is. A study in hands They seem to be hands at prayer. How much is it worth, then, sir? It's worth a great deal I couldn't say for sure.

Not initially, no it's part of a five-year program to run the estate entirely on ecological lines. It's all Penelope She's brilliant. The idea is to keep the hedgerows untouched and have an eight-foot margin either side before the crop line, and do you know the ground nesting birds have already quadrupled? Oh, excuse me, this is exactly my field. It's my job to let people know how important this stuff is. Really? We get the loonies ripping out the snares by the lake I mean, you know, we only set traps to protect wild birds like lapwings and grey partridges Penelope manages to keep calm I get I feel hot under the collar. People position their passions differently. Usually through blind ignorance I must say one finds oneself increasingly preferring the company of plants and animals to that of people. - Oh, my God It bit Mrs. - Oh, my God I'm terribly sorry It's blood from the local abattoir. They spray it in the fertilizer and it comes this way when the wind's in the east I'm doing everything I can. What's this, hurling blood all over the countryside? You all right? So sorry.

Just the thought of someone cutting open your tits sort of repulses me I don't even bear to think about it. It's not like that, though I've always wanted to do it and I just want to. People do it all the time. - Well, people are very fucked up. - You should know. What's that supposed to mean? What are you saying? Come on, tell me. Oh. So, were you inspired to paint like angels?

You were the last person to speak to him. You'll have to make the statement. Sure Of course. He was one of my oldest friends. What were these three boys doing in his flat late at night anyway? We can't say, but we're taking it very seriously. Of course you're taking it seriously How else are you going to take it?

Oh, it's a nightmare I hate it when he drinks like this. It's all that Killally stuff he's been doing. Are you sure he's all right, then? Yeah He'll be fine Just leave the aspirin out.

No fuckin' shit? - Hi, it's Trent Am I on speakerphone? - Yes. - Is Bushey there? - I'm with her now, and our illustrious editor. Look, you're a lawyer, a blind trust. How exactly do they work? - From whose point of view? - You know, our friend the minister I mean, how blind does it actually have to be? Bad boy. As blind as blind justice, my dear. A pillar of the realm swinging both ways We could all retire early. Right Thanks, I gotta go. I like the sound of this. This is all coming from some friend Is it solid? Not sure I'll ride him. Not for the first time I'm sure. All we need's a first draft I can do the rest. Can he get something on tape, anything? Sure Why stab a friend in the back when you can stab him in the front? Darling. Little fish. Let me look at you. How long has it been? A long time. Daddy likes his honey Right? Yes. Daddy likes it. You know, you know. Yeah, yeah, so, if they OK the ring road, then the houses that they build ebecome the hottest properties south of Oxford till they fall down 'cause they're made from spit and bog paper. Yeah, I've gotta go. - Hello Trent. - Hi, mate. Hey, Marcus Hi. Yeah, thanks for putting up with all my drink-sodden tales of self-pity the other night Can we forget it ever happened? - It's kind of boring anyway. - No, it's not boring at all. You were in a really bad way How are you? How's lona? - She's getting her boobs done. - No I'll kill the man that lays a finger on 'em. And she blew me out We were going to Scotland deerstalking. Listen, why don't you come along? - Yeah. - Come on, city boy, all paid for. Killing stuff, Arctic temperatures, haggis. It's very tempting but it's not me, mate. The voice of the countryside I bet you can't even tell a stag from a cow. No, I'm sure it's amazing I actually can't I'm sort of stressed at the moment Things are crazy right now. Sure All right, well, I'll see you in another five years, then. Oh, now, fuck off Look, we can hook up for a drink after work, get bladdered and we can stick pins in a wax doll of Killally. How is all that anyway? You look so terribly thin, my darling. An old man worries about these things. Women like to be thin. Yes, but you don't look well. Why don't you see a doctor, my darling? Won't you, please? You can say anything to me, you know. I don't want you to have any secrets. What's that? She's beautiful. Her father. Her father was a good man. Keep it. There's something for you over there on the side. Call me if you need, you know. Chiquitita. You know how much I love you. Mummy loves you so much. Even Even when she's not here. Mummy loves you forever. I spoke to my source, he confirmed everything. This is not a confession but he says what we need I'm gagging for it, hot shot Just press send. All right Well, just have a look. Our lawyer here wants you to stick with him until the story breaks, OK? We don't want him changing his mind or killing himself, or worse still, selling the story somewhere else. Yeah Right. Come on, Marcus, you've got to admit this wall is a wall of carnage. You'll love tomorrow, I swear. The land will power the soul. And it's a big thing, killing one of these guys. You know, it might sound strange, but it's. You know, it'll be the biggest thing in your life in a way. You're actually serious? Yeah You know what they say about the deepest of all of man's secrets, deeper than any role he might play to the outside world is his passion for killing It's an imperative. When you hunt the killing's not just about the food, prize, or need to do it. It's about the ritual. - It's deep. - Steady on. I'm just a bit of a wuss about blood. No, you're not, you're just ignorant about it I'll give you the eco version, OK? Make you feel better. You kill the weakest stag, the one that won't make it through winter. Keeps the herd strong, keeps them surviving. You have to do it. I don't know I don't know, but I I do know that I couldn't kill an animal like that. Clean kill. Straight through the heart. I don't believe in much. Whatever I do, I believe it when I'm here. Funny. I want to tell Wharton I'm not gonna manage his fucking blind trust anymore I don't care if he doesn't want me as a partner I don't care if they don't want me at all. The thing about you is is that you're just one of those people everyone loves. You've got that sort of star attraction thing that some people are just born with. Light shining from your brown eye. - I wish you'd go to hospital. - No I'm gonna have to insist. No No. No. Never. Come on What are you doing? Mobiles never work out here I had two bars a minute ago. Christ's sake, you can take the girl out of the city. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you hear me? Good. All right, I need to make a couple of changes to the Killally story. OK? Just take out a couple of paras. I know, but I want to get it right I'm with my Aylesbury guy and I really don't think he's involved. So we have to take his stuff out, OK? It's very important. For Christ's sake, get Bushey to call me back and. - Can you hear me? - Sure, Trent. Don't fuck it up. Prat. Now switch in the middle. Christ! Christ! Fuck us off again, it's not the stag we'll be shooting. Yeah I'm sorry. Mate, come on. - Are you OK? - Yeah. I, I need to tell you something, mate. Now? Could it fucking wait? Come on. Come on, let's go Let's go. He's yours Your first. I can't. - No I just can't. - Yes, you can. You can Take him, go on, come on Go on, now he's still Go on. You've got him before he moves You'll miss him, you'll miss him. - Go on, hurry Don't want him to move. - All right, OK. On the front leg, two inches. He's wounded Shoot again. Here, give it here, give it here. Good Good You got him. Sorry. Trent, come here Come here. It's a tradition. Your first kill. Wharton. Well, that's a rumour. What's in a rumour, Hugo? Yeah, thanks. I'll be an hour, tops. - She won't wake? - Not a problem. Nice. What up, mate? Really, it's OK It was only wounded for a couple of seconds You heard Ronny. No. No, it's not fine. Actually I've, ordered a taxi. It's gonna be here any minute. Why? 'Cause. I just fucked your life. You know, everything I've taken down everything you told me and sold it. I've destroyed your charmed life in one shot beyond your shittiest possible imagining. What are you talking about? It's big It's big. You and Wharton and the shares. And, everything I could find Jesus, what are you telling me, Trent? What are you fucking telling me? - I tried to get you out of it. - You. And? What have you done? - What have you done? - Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. - Hello! - It's all right, darling I got it. Hello? How in God's name? He knew before he came up He must have known. Come home, Marcus. Come down here with us. Dad, Dad! You know these people Call them. You can do it Please! You can call them You can stop them. File an injunction or something. Dad? You can do it. Give me half an hour and I'll call you back, all right? Just hold on. My God. Dad? It's too difficult and it's too late I can't do it Christ, Dad, you're a judge. Oh, I can make a fuss. But when they ask me if it's true I have to say yes. You said so yourself. Look. If I could make it my face instead of yours, you know that I would. But we can't lie. Can't we? Why not? You lie. We all lie. We can't lie here. Thank you. Thank you. Morning, Mrs Aylesbury If I can get you to pop down these. Just a little pre-med I'll be back in a tick over the scandal surrounding Geo Wharton and Marcus Aylesbury of Wendell Wharton Blunt, one of the city's most prestigious law firms. The sensational revelations that Lord Killally and his solicitors abused a blind trust have produced calls for an inquiry at the highestlevel. Killally used his position as minister of housing and planning to force through a controversial transport bill. When the go-ahead for the Banbury ring road was announced, the share price of Phoenix PLC, a property company owned by Killally, rose 30 percent senior partner of the firm that bears his name, has represented the interests of Lord Killally since 1994, and that's the year Killally first made donations to the Labour Party. Special report following headlines. The tabloid paper that printed the allegations claims to have a confession from one of the lawyers involved on tape. His father, Edward Aylesbury, a high court judge, has been connected with call girls. Photographs of a prostitute leaving his flat in central London. Marcus Aylesbury, recently made partner, is the alleged point of contact with Lord Killally. As a partner he stood to profit tens of thousands from the share purchases. Marcus Aylesbury and the other partners at Wendell Wharton Blunt face heavy jail sentences. - Where is he? - Just ran off Orlando! Come on. You didn't, did you? No No, I didn't. Hello? I tried to stay awake with her, but I. I felt she didn't need me then. For the last bit, anyway. I, I stayed with Maria, took care of the arrangements. The home is, The home is, - Do you have children? - No. I've thought about trying for custody, but I... I'd... I'd never get it. Do you have any idea what that would mean? Look, I shan't bully you again. No one need ever know I was here. Chambers never did get around to shifting it. My rock. - Who was that chap? - Journalist. "Dear Mr Griffin," I have been instructed to establish a trust fund for Maria Garcia Ramirez de Arroyo. Sir Edward Aylesbury wishes to appoint y you as a trustee of the fund. If this is agreeable to you, would you be kind enough to make an appointment at your earliest convenience? "Yours sincerely, DA Frischman". Darling boy. You know what I think I'll do? What do you think you'll do? I'll read War and Peace again. Why don't you? Yes. I think I will
