Don't turn around Miss Boletti! You have the money? Yes. All of the 10 million Notes are used? Yes. Good. You didn't inform the police of course? No. Bravo. Your son is all right. He will be released within 24 hours released. There he is. That's Boletti. Tell me, how many were there? How are you Mister Boletti? Let us through. Let us pass. Just one statement please. Excuse me, let us through. How much did the father pay? Why don't you talk to us? Stop it now. Come on, talk to us. Please let us go. There you are. How are you? You see he is doing well. You'll find out all about that tomorrow. We will hold a press conference. Excuse me, Mr. Boletti. I'm sure you want to rest. I am very tired but otherwise I am fine. Inspector, why don't you let us see him? We only want to report. Get out of the way, now. Go on. Commissioner, are you making a statement? Talk to him, he is in charge. Ah well, what will the police do now? This is not the first kidnapping and not the last. What do you mean? There is no reason for for the criminals to stop. There are many rich people with children and they will take advantage of that. Maybe the punishment is not strong enough. That is not part of my job to play judge. But first we must catch the culprits. before that, our hands are tied. We were only allowed to intervene after the ransom was paid. The police should stay out of it and that's exactly what we did. They say you are no longer part of the Police Commission? In fact, I have just just resigned. Go, go. To the station, as quickly as possible. Where is the car? I don't know. Ah, there he is. There you are. Sorry for the delay. Traffic, right? Headquarter 1, Headquarter 1, please Commissioner Danoni. Danoni here, go ahead. A woman's body was found. Where? Country Road 12. Has the prosecutor been notified? Yes, he is already there. Very good, we are on our way. We'll be right there. If you want, I can drive you to the hotel beforehand. No thanks, that's fine. For us it's pure routine apart from the rivalry with the prosecutor. That's how it is in the province. And Kidnappings? A bad situation at the moment. What? Kidnapping. You mean Raids? In the last kidnapping of Boletti 400,000 million liras were paid. Aha. What is being done now? The best thing is for the prefect to tell you himself. I'll be happy to drive you there. OK, thanks. Car 1, please come. Yes? Commissioner, the woman has been identified. It is the woman who was discharged from the hospital today. I see. They identified the woman. Who was she? A Prostitute. Come on, please. Good. The body can be taken away. Okay. I want the report now. Stop here. Commissioner, the pimp Pinaccio was seen. Has he been caught? Nobody knows where he is. Are you now convinced that the pimp is the possible perpetrator? Don't you understand I need proof? I guess there is, a body, a gun... and a motive - isn't that enough? Everything you need. Pinaccio was arrested last week. He had hit and injured the woman. At the hospital she said she had fallen. The hospital report says she was injured in an accident. She didn't report him, I can't have him arrested. There is no proof. Now the proof is here. Yes? Your call from Rome. I was expecting it. Hello Massimo, how are you? - Hi Dad! - I was at the station. Have you been too busy? Sorry I was late. Have you arrested anyone yet? Sometimes I really worry about you. Why don't you move in with your aunt? You'll be in good hands. I don't know yet how long I will stay. Understand? You're the new chief inspector. Don't be so stupid. Is Catalana here yet? No, not yet. But he should be here soon. If you need anything do not hesitate to call him. At the moment I am still in a hotel so no real address yet. Don't make trouble, you hear! It's all right. Ciao Papa. Ciao Massimo. Good evening. This is the new chief inspector. Today, everyone has the same problems. You pay more taxes than the others, much more than the others. You have to imagine it. Zanonni, how's your department? All good. Ah, there is Commissioner Jovine, until recently your predecessor. Good evening. He lives now in Milano. He is a good friend and we chat often. But please excuse me, I also have to take care of the other guests. Excuse my routine. The routine, of course. I think that's what they say, see you later. Do you want anything? No thanks, I don't drink. That is good. I've been told many times that you are the man they need here. I'm already too old for that. Everything seems normal here but actually the situation is very bad. Very bad, and in my opinion it is getting worse and worse. That is also the reason why I stopped. With all these new laws, the criminals have many advantages, It's very unfair, they don't care enough about the safety of the population. 99% of those arrested have a criminal record, they're playing with the law. Quite paradoxical, it is rather the criminals who are protected. Now these Kidnappings. Yes, I know. What is expected of me? You are expected to prove and assert yourself. You are needed. Or someone like you. I am available at all times. I am their natural ally. Of course. It's better to have him as a friend than as an enemy. Excuse me, could I speak to you alone, please? Excuse me. Look around, many important people present. Good advice, be friendly. Nice to meet you. Likewise. You better talk to Zanonni. What's up? Excuse me, sir. The gentleman would like to talk to you. Perhaps you will listen to me. I applied for a gun licence and this gentleman refuses because of my criminal record. Here is the criminal record. I'm clean. Clean, yes? Two entries for armed robbery. No criminal record. Because there was not enough evidence both cases were dropped. That means I'm clean. Do you have to walk around with a gun all the time? I need that for home. Zanonni, I need to talk to you for a moment. Reinforcement from Rome? Who's handling the current kidnapping with the Boletti boy? No one at the moment, that was over six months ago and has therefore been shelved. On file? We had to. We were no longer allowed to investigate, the ransom was paid and the boy was released home. And? Nobody knew who the kidnappers were, you know? Sure, and now they're enjoying the ransom. Do I understand that correctly? Well, there was nothing that... Excuse me. Hey Marcella you look great. Will you go out with me tonight? This is Boletti's son who was kidnapped with his girlfriend. Who are the others? They all live with their fathers. They have more money in their pockets than we earn in a month. They always come here. If someone is missing only because he is still in bed. Do you see those two over there? One is the nephew of a politician, a fascist. The other one with the white jacket is the son of a city councillor. An important councillor. That's Roberto Riccardi coming out of the bar. He has no worries, his father is in the electrical business. The father brings the money home and the son spends it. And the girl? Laura Ponti. She owns the shop and apparently business is very good. She understands how the business works. Car 1, Car 1, come in. Connecting. I'm listening. Robbery with hostage-taking in a bank. I see, we're coming. Inform all cars, we'll see you there. Go. Face the wall and put your hands up. This woman is sick. I don't care. You will parry, or else... there will be consequences. Shut your mouths or you'll be in deep shit. I saw them, there are two of them, they're wearing masks and they're armed. One of them stayed in the car and when I shouted, he drove away. Someone shouted, they were already in the bank. Can you describe the perpetrators? Yes, yes, I certainly can. Please come with me to the police station. Are they armed? The woman who saw everything said that they are armed with guns. Take the people away. Back, back. Has anyone informed the public prosecutor? He is coming. Good. Make sure there are only police cars are parked here. How many are inside? Only a few. The bank wanted to close. Ah. Good, the most important one is also there. Have all telephones turned off and switch off the power. Also talk to the doorman of the house. We have to control everything here, no one must die. Good, Commissioner. Back, get these people out of here, back. One of the perpetrators was recognised by the witness when she screamed. Give it to me, please. The suspect's name is Scalpelli Romeo, 19 years old. Get out of here, go back, there's nothing to see, go away. Inspector, the witness recognised one of the perpetrators, Scalpelli Romeo, 19, he's got a couple of precords... and could be dangerous. Good, tell that to Commissary Zanonni, tell him to come here. Hurry up, we don't have much time. Let's go, let's go, do what I told you. Back, all of you, quickly. Come on, help them. Come here, what's going on? I'm the manager, they have two men and a girl hostage. They want to take a car and the hostages with them. If the police don't leave they kill all three of them. And they said if no one followed them they will release the hostages. I see. Escort the woman to safety. Where's Zanonni? Leave me alone and clear this place out, now. Back. Back. Attention. This is the Chief Commissioner. I have heard your demands and I cannot accept them. You are recognised and right back in prison. Release the hostages, lay down your weapons. clasp your hands over your head. Now. What does the commissioner think we will answer him? Scream. Scream. I've heard about the demands of the gangsters. In order not to endanger the hostages... we will have to assume What guarantee do you have, their word of honour? The longer we stay here and negotiate with them, the more important they feel and and lose their respect. I consider the situation too dangerous. Besides, I have the authority. My authority. Would you be satisfied if I take responsibility? No, that is not the point. We have to protect the life of the hostage. That is important for me. Commissioner. Zanonni is back with the suspect. Give me half an hour. It may be the wrong man. So Everything looks easy. A good deal. Want to make a lot of money here. It's a pity you'll be behind bars for many years. But there is a difference between a robbery and a murder. Do you want to hear the difference in years? I didn't kill anyone and you know it. I know, but your friends are threatening. Should something happen to one of the hostages, you... are then also responsible for it. You'd better tell them that inside. You already know that. I hope I can. Tell me who they are. Attention! Mario Impelitteri da Rovereto. Carlo Carucci di Vicenca. I now know who you are. Your friend has spoken. Even if we let you go we'll get you later. Now you decide. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, we surrender. The prosecutor is waiting for you. Commissioner, is it true that one of the suspects was in court 10 days ago for robbery? Wasn't the man released by the the public prosecutor? Right. Commissioner, tomorrow they will talk about the robbery and criticise you. What do you say to your critics? But it turned out well. Have you not risked too much? You also have to take a risk. Under no circumstances should you give in to gangsters. If you give in to these gangsters it will never stop. Very well, have a nice day. Good day. That was quite clever. Please come in. Only takes a minute. So Cardone, You did a good job with the journalists. I am very happy about that. I could suggest how you could do better. Remember, I have the power and authority to stop you. Then why didn't you do it at the Bank today? Because I don't want to embarrass you in public. Commissioner, we are on the same team, don't forget that. But in different positions. Different but not opponents. You should not use the same methods as the criminals, which you did today. What are you trying to say? You create your own kind of justice like an organisation that somehow acts brutal. Sometimes that works. But I believe in legality and that is a principle of mine. Do not challenge me to prove it. We'll talk later. If you add the 400,000 million Lire for Boletti, it is one billion in just under a year. It looks like these kidnappers are at least very well organised. Looks like they need the money for an investment. A common criminal disappears to the Bahamas with the money. These people are very well informed, deceptively well. And they have no intentions to stop. What's the matter, are you tired? The motorway was endless. Where are you staying tonight? In a guest house. I think we should both find something permanent. I'm in a hotel and I don't like it. We can also share a house together. That'd be something, ha. Come on, let's go. Are they cops? You can tell. A few days ago I saw Massimo he passed his exams. Yes, I know. What are his plans? He said he wanted to go to the beach with friends. Before he left, he sent his greetings. Sometimes I think it would have been better to get married again. There's still time to do that. Oh, I don't know. Ah yes, Here is an interesting list that I got from the bank. Who is that? These are potential kidnap victims. Each of them has a full bank account. Please check them all, one by one. Their lives, deaths, miracles all kinds of things. Follow every track. Keep a low profile in the commissariat. Let's go, I'll bring them to you. Good morning, Commissioner Cardone. Mrs Boletti? Already in the office with her lawyer. Commissioner. Good morning. Thank you for coming. Good Morning. Mrs Boletti informed me, that's why I wanted to accompany her. That's very kind of you but not necessary. No problem. I am informed about what what happened at the bank. If all hostage situations were solved in this way then we would have peace. Please, sit down. Please. I'm sorry I had to invite you, but I have a few questions. What questions? About the kidnapping of your son. Andreas is not my son. I married his father. Excuse me, Commissioner, Mrs Boletti has already testified about the kidnapping, there's nothing more to say. Yes, yes, I see, but that's not a really a statement. 400,000 million is not a small amount of money, I'm sure you'll agree, counsellor. Excuse me madam, why were you chosen to hand over the ransom? The kidnappers demanded this. How did the handover go? A meeting point was agreed and I went there with the money and later Andrea was released. Of course you didn't see the kidnapper's face at the handover? No, it was dark. I was in the car and I had the money in a bag with me, the man opened and took the bag. Can you tell me who might have something against your husband? A disgruntled employee or a competitor? That can't be. I'm sure Boletti would have mentioned that. He didn't mention it at all, not to me, not to the police. Yes, that's right. Good, then I have no more questions. Thank you for coming Madame and if you think of anything else... Certainly, but I thought it was done with this? Unfortunately, it's not done. It is my duty to catch the kidnappers even if it looks like you're not interested in it. I was interested in Andrea be released. I didn't care about anything else. Goodbye, madam. Superintendent. Counsellor. Yes? Commissioner Cardone, the Chief of Police wants to see you. Yes, put him through. Is that you, Cardone? Good morning, Your Excellency. I tried to reach you in the morning. I just wanted to congratulate you on the hostage situation. Thank you. I was told Mrs. Boletti will come to you? Yes, she just left. But Cardone, this is not good publicity for our police questioning her. Sorry, President, but it's not good publicity when the gangsters get away. Yes, yes, but 6 months have passed, the case is closed and done. Keep me informed, please, Cardone. I will. Goodbye. I have decided to reopen the last kidnapping cases again. The Boletti case for example, the report consisted from a single sheet. And that's why you came to Milan? What do you expect? A new clue? Be happy that you have something. Have you been told what to do? On a single sheet of paper it says what the police is allowed to do and what not. The payment of 400,000 million, who collected the money, who delivered the money and in what time. Thank you. What else should I have written? That the boy can't remember anything? That the woman was in shock? That it was cold? But it seems odd that she didn't do anything before, or after. You mean like you did at the bank? What if they had shot? Cardone, three kidnappings in a row. I still say, don't play with the lives of hostages. Of course life is precious. But where do you draw the line? Listen Jovine, have you never considered going behind the kidnappings that there is a motive or an organisation? What I mean is that they were not ordinary criminals but People with a political motive, planning arms purchases or bombings, on trains, perhaps, Weapons cost a lot, like politicians they need money, all the time. Politicians, ha. It is always about politics. When there is no answer Politics. I see, and now? Should the police monitor 10 million Communists? Or the 3 million fascists? Or half a million priests? There they are. Good morning. You're here at last. Good morning. This car was here empty and blocking the road. We found it like this and didn't touch anything. Good, good. Please come here. That looks like a crime. You have to move the car. We can't get through here. It is a Triumph, TR6. TR6, Milan Milan 8..., Wait a minute, what was the number? Milan 8089 registered on Ricardi Alberto Via Vascini 47. Vascini 47. Stay with the car. I'm going there. Yes, okay. The Ricardi housekeeper told me that son Alberto left around 8. Maybe that doesn't mean anything either. It goes on Catalano. There is a new kidnapping, now it has hit the Ricardi family. I see. He has nothing but money. You have done that very well. We have to react immediately, I want there to be roadblocks... and the family must be monitored, Telephone etc. good. Ricardi wanted to meet a girl. From the bar, remember? Ah exactly, who runs the place. I want to see you, bring you here. Is there a Mrs Laura Ponti here? That's me. What's up? Thank you, Commissioner. If you need anything I am always at your disposal. I will remember that. Zanonni please come. I'll be right there, Commissioner. Hello! Hello. Commissioner? Tell me, what's the name of the guy who was just here? Vergano. He got a gun licence. Why did he get one? Well, he is talking to us, he is very useful, he gives us tips, he's an informant, minor crimes, robbery, car thefts even the president's secretary knows about it. That's why he got it. Yes. Please? Commissioner, the woman... Yes, yes, come in. Please, sit down. Come on, don't be afraid. You're Laura Ponti? Yes. You know an Alberto Riccardi? Yes, what about him? When did you last see him? Yesterday in my bar. Didn't you want to go out with him? He said he would come but he didn't. Alberto Ricardi has disappeared. His car was found abandoned. You don't know what could have happened to him? No, I don't know. I waited for him in the bar and thought he'd forgotten about it. Well, that was all for the moment. Maybe there will be more questions later. Thanks. How's it going? I think I got it. Hello? Hello? Listen Ricardi. Switch to the control centre. You don't have not to worry about your son. How is he? Can I talk to him? No. Do what I tell you. If you want to see him again keep the police out of it. We want 400,000 lire in used notes in 10,000 packets. We will inform you when and where the money will be handed over. I repeat'. no Police. If you follow our instructions you will see your son again. All right, I see. Situation report. Magenta 16. Magenta 16. The two cars are just passing us. We follow and wait for instructions. The lawyer just drove off. Well, go to sleep you had... No, that's all right. But my son is in Germany. I have no reason to be worried. In Germany? Why? Because of a contract signing. I have a partner there. In Munich. Mr Ricardi, your son has disappeared. We found his abandoned car. He probably lent the car to someone. He had a date with a girl and never showed up. Maybe he forgot about it. A few minutes ago your lawyer Samperi left you. He represents my interests. That's how we see each other again and again. That's really none of your business. What is my son to you? Everything you do interests me as long as your son is missing. When a kidnapping happens in front of your eyes it's our business. The police is here to protect their citizens. The law has everything to lose if it is ignored. This cannot replace your money because it is more valuable. What else do you want to tell me? Yes, one more thing... I am sorry for your son. But believe me... I will prevent any negotiation with the kidnapper. Any attempt to pay ransom, I guarantee it. No, no, no, excuse me. What is the police doing? Where is the boy? Has he been kidnapped or not? His father says he is in Munich. And the abandoned car? The car was parked and not even in the no parking zone. Good day. Go on, go on. Go. Magenta 7, Magenta 7, Headquarter respond. All roadblocks are active, all cars are being checked. The operation has begun, all cars are being checked. Put me through to lawyer Samperi. Excuse me Miss, but you had an appointment with Alberto Ricardi. It should be yes to answer, where you always met and went there. And? On various places. Do you know also Boletti? Boletti Andrea, do you remember, who was kidnapped? Yes. Did you also go out with him to various places? If you don't mind, that's my business. Where were you going to meet Ricardi that night he didn't show up? The prosecutor and Samperi are here. Okay, let them in. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes? Has he not shown up once before? Please Counsellor. Didn't that seem strange to you? Good morning. Sit down. Lawyer Samperi told me about your methods which seem unmotivated to me. I find these methods outrageous. I demand that the surveillance of the house of Ricardi be ended immediately. I'm afraid I have to assume that Mr. Ricardi is in denial about his son's kidnapping. You have no proof of this. No? Hello? Hello? Is this Ricardi? Yes. Listen to me very carefully, we have your son. How is he? Can I speak to him? No. Follow our instructions. If you want to see him again, keep the police out of it. Prepare 400,000 million lire in used 10,000 packets. Mr. Prosecutor, did you allow that the police is tapping Mr Ricardi's phone? I repeat. The police is not informed. No. Then I'll see you in court. Do you have the instructions? Commissioner Cardone, You must inform my office about all your activities. If it is necessary you must apply for it. I have no intention of applying for something that will be rejected. You know that the possibilities of the police are limited. It is out of your hands. The family decides for itself how how to deal with the kidnappers. I cannot allow the police to interfere. Should the police perhaps stand idly by how unscrupulous criminals take millions for themselves? I'm sure they'll use the money for new crimes. You do not have the right to play with the lives of the abductees. Of course, that can't happen to you, with your measly salary. That's right, I don't have that kind of money. as you have just kindly reminded me. But if my records are correct your client does not have the money either. What I mean is, on the basis of these documents I see the income and tax levies which he deducts. You have no right to to inspect these documents. The inspector claims that my client is a thief. You will pay for this. Counsellor, will you please excuse us. Mr. Prosecutor. Good day. Zanonni. Yes, Commissioner. Samperi is about to leave the house, have him shadowed. I don't want the kidnappers to be paid the ransom. I will do everything in my power that there will be no contact with the kidnappers. For the entire Ricardi family and all your friends, including the lawyer. The bankers, all your employees, their lawyers, We will also tap their phones. If something happens to the son, what then? Then I will draw consequences Mister Prosecutor. I know what I do is unpopular. I also have concerns. But this is the fourth kidnapping this year. If we let the ransom payment go through there will be a fifth, a sixth, seventh, tenth, and then? Here Zanonni, Commissioner Cardone, Cardone, come in. I will Commissioner. He has a meeting with the public prosecutor. Please quickly, it's urgent. Hello, Commissioner Zanonni. I am putting you through to the Commissioner. Here Cardone. Commissioner, I am in front of the bank. Ricardi is standing in front of the bank, waiting for someone. Okay, a car just pulled up, it's lawyer Samperi. They just went into the bank. Stay tuned. Hello. Mrs. Boletti, please. Right away. Mrs. Boletti, for you. For me? Thank you. Hello? Are you Mrs Boletti? Yes. Who is it? We have talked before, remember? Hello. Where's Catalano? Quickly. They called at the hairdresser, we're listening. How is the boy? He's fine, don't worry. don't worry. Listen. Mr Ricardi is organising the ransom money. We can't talk to him because his phone is tapped. This means that you have to take care of the handover. Hold on. I have nothing to do with it. You do what we tell you to do. Get money and bring it to the same place at five o'clock. Commissioner Cardone, Zanonni here. They have just come out of the bank. Do they have a suitcase or a parcel with them? No, nothing. Okay. Stay on them. That means that Mrs Ricardi organises the money. Good bye. Thanks. Miss Boletti, excuse me. I have to ask you something. Commissioner, I'm in a hurry. Another time. I don't think you quite understand. You have to accompany us to the police station. Let me take the bag. Allow me? We can drive your car if you would like us to. Please. That's all right, I'll park your car for you. Please. Commissioner. There you are. Please for information. Commissioner, is there any news? Why don't you say something about the kidnappers. Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning. Can you wait here for a moment, please? Come on Zanonni. Anything new? Nothing. Headquarters here, please. Hello? I need to speak to my husband. Hello? Of course, but I have to give you the right extension. Hello? Please connect me with Boletti. The number is... Good. Get back to me in a minute. Here I am, sorry again. Would you like to sit down? No thanks, I prefer to stand. All right. What's in this bag? You are welcome to open it. What I'd like to know is, do you have a search or an arrest warrant? No, not at all. I kindly asked you to come along and you came with pleasure. Good, then I kindly ask you to let me leave with my bag. Certainly, certainly, except that you are here with a fortune, thousands of lira. So what? Nothing really, but we need a confirmation in this regard. Pure Formality. Zanonni, please do. Of course. Thank you. Only takes a few minutes. We hold on to that as fast as you can. Sorry, I am new here and don't have much practice yet. All right, I hereby confirm Miss Sorry, what was your first name? Renata, Renata Boletti. Renata. Boletti right? Yes. Boletti. Boletti. I, Renata Boletti, hereby certify, very good, born Excuse me, date of birth? Okay, give me the position of the two cars. Catalano. Anything new? I certify that I have received the amount of Lira Excuse me. L i... r... e. Confirm at the commissariat the Receipt of Lire Excuse me Madame. Hello? Zanonni. Don't let her use the phone and try to hold her up as long as possible. Yes, okay. So, I, Renata Boletti, hereby certify at the Commissariat... the receipt of Lire... Excuse me Madame, how many Lire? 400.000 Lire. Yes. Pretty much. Who takes responsibility there? Miss Boletti. Would you please come? No, why? I said come on. We photograph everything here. I'm done now. The report will come tomorrow morning. Have you informed the family of Mr Ricardi? Yes, I sent a man. Please send the report as soon as possible. After the autopsy. Tomorrow morning. Very well. I'll call you. No. Investigate the whole area. He was murdered. It makes no sense. Now you're blaming me, I'm up to my neck in trouble. They are also involved. Tell me how that happened, Mrs Boletti. Why did the kidnappers ask you a second time to deliver the money? Who are you covering for? What are you trying to hide? Mrs Boletti, either you speak with me or in court. Over a year ago, I had an affair with a friend of my husband. I know about that, go on. As we've seen each other many times someone found out. Were you then blackmailed? No. But somebody collected evidence about it. Maybe he was planning to blackmail me or my boyfriend. But instead, I was supposed to help with the kidnapping. Nothing happened, he said he would get in touch later. I could be of help. And his name? I don't know. I only heard his voice on the phone. But it's the same voice that called me twice about the ransom. All I remember is he had an accent. He's certainly not from here. Inspector Cardone! Wait. Were you right now? Are you aware that you can get problems? Isn't it time to make a statement? Yes, I will make a statement. But before that, I'm holding a press conference. See you later. That's another one of his tricks. Hello. You don't have to hide it. I've already read everything. Is the coroner here yet? Yes. Ah, your son Massimo called from Rome. What did he say? He's arriving tomorrow with the express train. Anything else? The prosecutor's waiting inside. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Tell the coroner. And the journalists too. This is a very unpleasant matter. Cardone, lawyer Samperi has prepared a lawsuit on behalf of the Ricardi family... against you for the death of their son. Just a minute. Good morning. Please. Take photos. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Come in. Please be quiet for a moment. Commissioner Cardone asked me personally to present you with the results of the autopsy. An autopsy performed on Alberto Ricardi was performed. During the autopsy was confirmed. Result'. Death by drowning, after blows to the head with a hard object which caused bruises on the left side of the brain was knocked completely unconscious. As a second result we have we found that death occurred at least 2 or 3 days has occurred. This means that the victim was killed immediately. In my opinion in the following hours of the kidnapping, at the latest the next morning. No matter if the money would have been paid, the murder could not have been prevented. But that also means that the police cannot be blamed. But isn't it also your opinion that the police has to protect people in a Situation similar to this, and protect the lives of innocent people? Absolutely right! Innocent is the correct term. Plural is quite correct because the police should not protect the life of a person but the entire population of the city that is innocent. Commissioner Cardone, you still haven't justified your methods. You risk the lives of innocent people to catch the guilty. The reporters have reported on some of your investigations. The hostage-taking at the bank and then Ricardi's son. I ask for your opinion. I'm sorry to hear that, but I think if we negotiate with leaders with terrorists or hijackers, if we give in to them, Tolerate their violent threats, then we put everything on the line because they have nothing to lose. If we allow them to threaten us with bombs and allow ourselves to be blackmailed, That would be the end of our society. I will do everything to prevent this. Commissioner, you and I disagree on this and you know it. Regarding the incident, I would like to emphasise that I am extremely sorry for what happened. Attention please, train arriving arriving on track 2. Attention please, train arriving arriving on track 2. Please continue, Miss. I have not thought enough but then I put two and two together. That evening when they talked about the kidnapping I had a date with him. We know that, you told us that. I have waited for him but another man showed up. It was a man who asked me for something, maybe he wanted something from me I thought. I always have to deal with some visitors, but these are friends of mine. I had the impression that he somehow knew something, and that was clear that Alberto could not come at all. But he behaved calmly and not at all nervous. Who was that? Vergano. Alvaro Vergano. You know him. I saw him here once. The guy who wanted the gun licence. He's an informant. Express to Padua - Venedig - Mestre Express to Padua - Venedig - Mestre departs from platform 1. Excuse me, are you Massimo? Commissioner Cardone's son? Yes. Your father sent me to pick you up. He could not come. Very good. Please. No, no, thank you. I sit in the front. Marshal, I found this under the bed. Very good, keep looking. No sign of Vergano but this is what we found. That's why he wanted the gun licence. Come in. This just arrived for the commissioner. Who brought this? A messenger, he said it was very urgent. Commissioner Cardone, we're at Vergano's house, no sign of him, what now? Leave Tadei there and keep looking for Vergano. Keep the house under surveillance but tell them camouflage themselves well. Quick, come to the office. What's up? Speak. Come on, now. Come on, speak. Hello Papa. Here Massimo. I was kidnapped. Now it was my turn but I'm fine, don't be afraid. They say, they say, they know that you are not rich. They are satisfied with a month's ransom. I didn't know you earned so little. Okay, that's enough. Now you've heard it. This was brought a few minutes ago. I couldn't believe it at first. But it's true, it's Massimo. They have him. They must be crazy, they'll stop nothing. Hello? Commissioner Cardone, for you, a friend of your son. Hello? Commissioner Cardone, did you get the tape from your son? What do you want? Now you are finished, Commissioner. Quick, switch to Cardone's phone. You mean you think you can't negotiate with kidnappers. One must not pay a ransom, that can cause us a lot of damage. Your theory makes it complicated for us. Now you have to decide for your son. Pay or don't pay. You will announce it in the press. We will then contact you again. We are not joking. Commissioner Cardone's son was kidnapped yesterday. Probably last night around 6 p.m. The kidnappers have informed the press and television about the kidnapping. They informed the commissioner about a symbolic ransom payment. It is your intention to force Cardone to change his stance on ransom payments and the behaviour of blackmailed persons influence in this respect. It is likely that Cardone will pay the ransom and correct his attitude. and will agree with the others who are of the opinion that life of the hostages is more important than anything else. It's me. What are you doing? Have you gone mad? That's none of your business, Vergano. It's my business. You can't do that. The commissioner's son. I want nothing to do with it. Stay calm, nothing can happen. We'll do it. Gentlemen, please. Step inside. Step inside. Good morning. Good morning. We have learned of the abduction of your son and we are very sorry. What should we do? What shall we write? Will you get involved with the kidnappers? Yes. That is the only option. Please publish the following. First I have to talk to my son. If you allow it. But I need to hear his voice. And then? That is all. A bad situation Commissioner Cardone. So is it different with your son? Get Out! There is nothing more to say. Everybody out. Get out here. Faster, get out. Come on. Thank you for coming. I heard about your son, I'm sorry. I wanted to ask you if you knew anything about this man, he was a police informer for a long time. Ah, Vergano. Yes, I remember him well. Perhaps I have overlooked certain circumstantial evidence, he might know something. That is possible. He has no scruples whatsoever. He would betray his sister. He would do anything for money. But he's too insignificant to pull something like this off. Where is he? He is wanted. Cardone, what do you think? Forget your principles. Forget your position, forget your career. Is your work for the police worth it? You should pay. Pay to get your son back, that's all this is about. With the media. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want something to eat? No, no, thanks. Hello, here Cardone. Any news? No, Commissioner. Get me Catalano. Yes Commissioner? News about Vergano? Nothing. But we'll get him, Don't worry. All right, see you then. Commissioner Cardone. Here Cardone. Commissioner Cardone, We are following them. If you want to talk to your son do what we say. At the next crossroads turn right. Drive two hundred metres further until you see a Cafe. Stop and go into the cafe. I don't think we need to remind you if you want to talk to your son do not talk to the headquarter. What can I bring you? Do you have light? Sure. A coffee please. Is there anyone here who's waiting for his son Massimo? Where is he? He's on the phone. Where? Right over there. Thank you. But briefly, please, this is a service phone. Hello? Here, speak to your father. Hello Papa. Massimo, hi, how are you? Fine, and you? What do you think? There is nothing more important. I have done something wrong. No. I don't think so. Why don't you believe that? Many young people want to fight for their ideals, do you remember father? Many of us young people think about tomorrow tomorrow for us is different and it will happen. We want a world without violence and without barbarism. What are you trying to say? Nothing. Follow your duty. Completely. Yes, of course. I will pay, of course. No, you can't help me like this or somebody else. I can make you understand we all have to do our duty. Everyone has to, you after your own kind, I'll do it my way. Listen Massimo, you mean... that you have to do what you have to do, Papa. Stick to your principles. No Massimo, I'll never see you again. Forget about me. Don't pay the blackmailers... pay them nothing. Massimo! Massimo! Massimo! Hello? Hey, aren't you going to hang up the phone? Hello Vergano. Come on. Good, good, understand. Commissioner Cardone please. Roadblocks everywhere, fast. I'm glad you're here. And? How is he? Not good, he's been stabbed multiple times. Go. Good evening. Good evening. Close it, now. This is Commissioner Cardone. Where is my son? He is in bad shape. You have to wait... I have to question him no matter how he is. Come on Vergano, where is my son? He... Listen Vergano. I know for a fact that you were involved with all these kidnappings. Now they have almost killed you. Speak. Tell me who gives the orders. Tell me who it is. Who is the boss of this organisation? Tell me where you've taken my son. Go on, talk! Commissioner, I... Come on, lets go. And? He will survive. Go over to the office. Now. Lets go. Would you like to go for a coffee? No, no, thank you, drive. Turn right after the traffic lights. Wait for me here. Good morning. Cardone. Cardone, here, here. I was expecting you. I never underestimated you. Did you come alone? I always get up very early. Fresh air and a glass of Milk. My father did the same. He must have been a good guy. I did not know him. He went to Africa in 1927 and I never heard from him again. Remember when I was in your office? You were curious about Vergano, you suspected something. That's why he had get eliminated. That bastard. You understood immediately. You are a good cop. Congratulations. Very rare a man of your calibre supports a government in this... Chaos. They know that there is a lot of money to be made with kidnappings and robberies. All this money goes to parties, right and left, this is a country which lives from blackmail and kidnapping. Injustice. Murders for hire, we are a country of murderers. Ungovernable! Destabilised. Is it this democracy that you defend? You really believe that violence will restore order and peace will come? Yes, that is necessary. Our hope is to restore the social system in our country. With the method of murder and Violence? Don't be blind Cardone. Law and order is only on one side. We will talk about that another time You know why I am here. You want me to tell you where your son is. Strange guy this Massimo. He ruined the whole plan that had been agreed upon, you wanted to pay. The difficulties started only because of this little boy. He should grow up. Growing up? That depends on you. How? Your son's life vs. Freedom for me and my people. Commissioner. You can come now. Jovine you are under arrest. You can present your ideology in court. You are crazy Cardone! Arrest me and you'll never see your son again. I know where my son is. Vergano has spoken, he is not dead. All I wanted is your confession old man. Get him out. Hello here Catalano. We have surrounded the house. Inform Cardone. Ask him what what is supposed to happen next. Magenta 1 to Central. We call Cardone. Catalano has had the house moved and asks how we should proceed. Tell him not to waste a minute. OK, understand. They are coming. The police is outside, the house is surrounded. Bloody hell. They cut the phone. Get up. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I am the son of Cardone. Massimo! Here is Catalano, look. Catalano, they will kill me if you don't let them leave. Do you understand? We'll be out in a minute. and if you don't want him dead, you'll let us go, understand? Get him in. Hello Zanonni. They want to get out of here. We're supposed to let them go or they will kill Massimo. He could tell us himself, they kept him out by the balcony. Inform Cardone. If we stop them they will kill your son. Tell Catalano no one is allowed to leave the house. That is an order. All right, Commissioner. How much longer do we need? We have to go through the whole city Commissioner. Let the headquarter know. Commissioner Cardone's orders, no one is to leave the house. That won't be possible, we'll put Massimo in danger. Try to close the road for traffic. And avoid a shoot-out. Attention! A man with a child! No! Noooooo! Come here, fast! Call the Headquarter. We need an ambulance. Lets go. We follow them on the road to the station. In a few seconds we pass the station. Run them out of town. That will not be easy. Try it, in the city it will be impossible to get them. We are at the roundabout, the traffic is aggravating. Turn all traffic lights green and keep the traffic flowing. The roads must be clear. Take him upstairs. Yes, Commissioner. Cars 3 and 7, blocking the Motorway exit. All cars to the motorway slip road. Car 4 and 16 to the north tangent. Catalano. Catalano. Catalano, what is happening? Where do you go? They are just outside the city and are going zigzag. Three cars are in pursuit, but we have concerns about your son. We are in the North. Increase the roadblocks wherever you can. Block all crossings. Try to stop the traffic. If we keep going like this we'll soon be on the motorway. They use the new driveway. This is the new motorway section. It is still closed to traffic. The exits have not been completed. There is only one way to stop them. No. No. Are you insane? A door has just opened. No, no, no. They want to kick him out. No, stop it, let me. Noooo, noooo! Out with him, push him. Watch out. Catalano, what is happening? Catalano? Call an Ambulance. Subtitles Cineploit 2021
