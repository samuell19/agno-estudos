How dare you speak to me like that I would never have employed you in the first place a washer woman's son You haven't done an honest day work since you've been here Nor ever likely to,well you can take a week notice,you understand A week's notice And clear up those documents and take them to the vault Alas It's no use I intend to wait Ah,Mr Duncalf at last I found you in I'm extremely sorry Mrs Codleyn but I'm very busy just for the moment If you make an appointment with my clerk I do not care to make an appointment What I'm asking you to do when I've taken the trouble to drive into town to see you is to listen to what I have to say And actually remove your hat to do so My dear Mrs Codleyn I'm aware that I'm not your most important client but the property you manage for me and the rent you collect on my behalf are not insignificant and surely entitle me My dear Madame Entitle me to elementary courtesy as I was about to say when you interrupted me But I see that I was mistaken Madam if you care to place your interest in other hands I should only be too delighted to hand over all your papers and payments on my cost And Good Morning to you Mrs Codleyn It is you Mr Machin.If Duncalf sent you to apologize you can save your breath It's not that Mrs Codleyn, listen what I want to explain Explain? I'm not used to be insulted,Mr Machin I shall not think indeed It's too cruel.Just look at our widows, nobody to protect me,to be spoken like that Let me tell you this I take Mr Duncalf at his words if there was somebody else I could trust but I don't understand anything about rent collectors That's what I want to talk about,Mrs Codleyn I collect your rent for you if you like You? You see I have given him my notice, the fact is that Duncalf I don't hit it off together -But you're only a clerk -And what's more I'll do it for 5 % instead of 7,5% and I settle accounts every month or week if you like Instead of once a quarter like he does Well I don't know that I. 5 % did you say? The usual rent 6 months off the arrears.There you are -10,11 -Three more Will you have to go just without your pint,wouldn't you? If it's rent you want,not for you Calm now Mrs Hullins that won't do Here take a pinch of tobacco I'm not going without a half a crown at any rate You will be here for better part of some time then I've told you about my son Jack, he's been out of work six weeks he starts today,he will let you have some of it It won't do,mother,we can't have any more arrears,you know The way you people go on, your ruining poor Mrs Codleyn Six and forty years I've been lived in this heir house And look what you owe It's the bailiffs for you I'm afraid Neigh,neigh,you will not turn me out I'm sorry mother,it's the rent or the bailiffs,one or the other Look I hate to see you turned out of your home I'll lend you half a crown if you like But I can't do it for nothing You pay me back next week and give me a twopence -You are a queer Mr Machin -That's fair isn't it? Now get your rent book Twopence a week for half a crown that's 10 %,that's 40% per month and 500% over the year,you see mother I've still got that 5 £ I won at the ball 5£ 10% per week compound interest, why that is a fortune That's lots of them hard up to the rent it will be doing them a kindness Supposing they won't pay you back They'll have to,you see when they pay me the next rent I won't mark it down in their books unless they are straight with me Aren't you impressed? Come on Joey -You're Machin. -That’s me -My name is Calvert -Oh yes I've been hearing a lot about you Get the rents in no nonsense, that's what old Mrs Codleyn tells me Clears up the arrears 5% that is monthly right?

Yes,Friday don't forget to practice your turns I won't -Good Afternoon,Mr Machin -Good Afternoon,Nellie,Miss Cotterill -I like your hat -Thank you -How do you do Miss Earp -How do you do Mr Machin -Can I come in a moment -Please do It's a long time since we seen anything of one and another,Mr Machin Yes it is Do sit down Thank you I've been called about the rent,Miss Earp The rent? Yes I collect rents,you know Indeed I thought you were a gentleman Mr Herbert Calvert has instructed me that no rent is to be allowed to be remain in arrears Let's see you owe 30 £ plus Mr Herbert Calvert,that what he has done I presume you know what happened? Happened? Mr Calvert took advantage of his visit here for his rent to behave in a very vulgar and offensive way What did he do? Insulted me I've would have given him notice to leave instantly if I haven't had to consider my pupils As it was I decided to withhold the rent and I shall continue to do so until I receive an apology It wouldn't be convenient then to pay something on account Convenient? Everybody in this town knows that my clientele get larger every year Convenient? It's perfectly convenient I just don't care to Is that final Miss Earp? Absolutely Then I think the simplest thing for me will be to send round the bailiffs tomorrow morning early I see so I'm to be persecuted as well No,the bailiff is quite a nice chap What curious man you are Mr Machin Very well I suppose I shall have to give in I'll write you tonight With the money? You could give it me now really,couldn't you? Yes,I could and make you thoroughly ashamed of yourself I shall give you some tea as well -There is no need -But there is I insist -More tea? -No thank you -Let me take your cup -Thank you -Cigarette? -Thank you The matches are inside -Sure you don't mind? -No,I like it Do you smoke? I like a man to smoke I hear that you were a member of the Country Club now Oh,yes It means you are becoming a very important person The bank manager put me up As you know people are still talking about the way you danced with the Countess If it hadn't been for you I hadn't been able to dance with her I'm sure you are the sort of a man who could do anything if you wanted to Ashtray? I'm keeping you No,no,I have a pupil coming in five minutes,that's all Anyway you can't go before I paid you -Well -No.I insist Every month I put your horrid Mr Calvert's rent in this box It's all there I see Now you shall open it Turn it sharply into the right Not seems to open It's broken I'm afraid I'm so sorry It's not your fault Just that I don't see how we're going to get it opened You mind calling in at Aldman it has to send somebody around forceps first thing in the morning And then I can call in and give you the money That's all right I can call Can you? Oh,yes To tea? A pupil Tomorrow then? Tomorrow Is there anybody there? Who is it? It's me Miss Earp Yes.What on earth are you doing in there What did you say? I said what on earth.Never mind I'll try and get round to you Where are you? I'm in here.On the table Just a moment I got some matches Goodness I hit my head.I think I may have fractured it Can't you get me out? I think we are too far from the bank How deep is the water down there? Not very Then I'll come down The men just put the table in and said it was time for supper and took the waltzed out and went Furniture men are always like that But how did you get here? I was looking for a box to pet the china in I see doing a moonlight flit You've got a nerve I don't need what you mean, I was helping a friend A friend? That's your table you are sitting on there The same one which has a little box with a lock that doesn't work I've looked surprised, a chump going up to an empty house for tea tomorrow,wouldn't I? And all that talk about Calvert insulting you well it's bailiffs for you this time Miss Earp and make no mistake about it Bailiffs I say it's not as bad as that,it isn't really I did tryt o pay but it was no good It was too much owing and so few people who wanted to dance I wasn't extravagant you've got to have good clothes and things if you want the nice people to come And it wouldn't be any good my selling it all up then I'd had nothing Where were you going? I was going to my father in Birmingham I didn't know you had a father, why doesn't he help? He's bankrupt again Again? He's been bankrupt four times That's why I tried on my own What is it going to become of me You'll be all right We better get out of here That table was made of iron,isn't it? Yes.Why?

No he pays me 10 £ and gets 10 £ worth of gods from you or somebody else And you do this just to help the working man Oh,no.You give me 15% discount Wait a minute Because he can only use his club card at a shop which I nominated and the shop I nominate is the one that give me 15% discount,you see I see you're quite a card yourself aren't you Mr Machin All right.I'm on But it is extra business for you Mr Bostock the club makes it easier for them to buy You'll get customers you've never ever seen before isn't that worth 15% How do I know I'll get my money from you I'll open an account with you today,give you a deposit,right All right Machin I'll give it a trial but I want 50£ deposit fee 50 £ deposit will rule me out A deposit Machin and I'm in Deposit,deposit,deposit,deposit... I'd like to help you Denry but I'm afraid I can't But the whole thing is a colossal success I know if it weren't you won't be needing money It's an old disease,Denry, you're undercapitalized I know that that's why I came to the bank I'll be frank,Denry,these people of mine at the head office all they see is a young chap without anything really solid behind him asking for a loan which they think twice about giving to an old established business house They don't like that,you see, you're not respectable I am not respectable? From a banking point of view you are not Now,if you had someone with a name With a position to keep up a reputation for probity to consider would lend that name to the club's activities as a patron say that would be different -See? -I see Thanks Someone respectable? So you see John there is nothing in it I'd like to oblige Denry but I'll tell you what,you know those new kitchen rangers with brass knobs and everything Yes You do this for me I'll get Mr Calvert to install one of those rangers in your mother's kitchen Well I do not.. Brass knob now what you say? Well it is bit.. All you got to do is to give me the thumps up sign as you pass So that's settled.Isn't it? Denry I.. Come on Joey What is it?

About 20 minutes My Lady -It's too long -Yes,My Lady Good Afternoon Countess.Had an accident? No I'm doing this for idle amusement Can I be of any assistance to you? You know Mr Machin I 'd rather think you can Things like the 5 £ Universal Club Card is something people need round here It's makes it easier for them to buy the things they want I see.You are very charitable Mr Machin Oh no I'm just fond of make money So I imagined I don't see anything wrong with that,Countess,do you? No.But I don't see myself as patron either I'm afraid Mr Machin Well.Here we are just about to turn into the square in a couple of minutes in hand Not bad for a mule You're all right I think we better walk don't you?

Because it's for charity and a good charity at that the Bursley Cottage Hospital In fact I think the best way we can thank the Countess for coming here this afternoon is to give it all the support we can And just to show you that I mean what I say I'm going to start the ball rolling by buying something Now what's cheapest? Well whatever it is I'll give 50 £ for it and I hand my cheque to your committee this afternoon There it is,Ladies and Gentlemen, now move along please let's show the five towns that Bursley's heart in the right place Good Bye Sir Home coming Shall I make the tea Mrs Machin?

I'm so sorry I didn't know Nellie has been telling me about your success I expect she made too much of it I expect she has He's always so modest He always was -Nellie -Yes mother Tea is ready I did very little shopping in Paris, I didn't want to stay but I simply couldn't fit going back there again to that horrid Swiss hotel crammed full of tourists Thank you So I went to Monte Carlo instead it was very dear of course Yes it must have been But not as dear as Venice That was gayer? Naturally.Much. I stayed with the Comtesse Martinario and her brother they have a nice palace It used to be the Duke of Rodriguez's, of course they only keep about 26 of their own servants But it is very very comfortable and so much easier to run and after all we spent most of the time on the yacht Denry do pass the cake to Lady Capron-Smith Me No thank you It must very tame for you here back in England No.I like England.After all it is where one's real friends are and one dear say long for news I'm afraid nothing much has happened here Alderman Mould died I'm afraid I don't.. He was going to Mayor in December Now I suppose we should have to have Mr Duncalf He is a horrible man and now he want to close down the football club just because it won't pay Silly old Duncalf Nellie I think that is your father back Will you excuse me? Really? -You drive well -It's easy once you got the knack of it -You've changed,you know -Have I? You are so much more self-assured mature Changed a bit yourself? What children we were Do you remember Mr Calvert's rent? Yes. Do you? This is more comfortable than the furniture van Of course if I got one I have to have a chauffeur I didn't know that your husband had a title What was it? A Lord? No.Only a knight I didn't even know he kicked the bucket..died How did it happen? We had only been married a little while,two months It was very sudden.Heart He overtaxed his strength Of course he was quite elderly but most good and kind He was in steel Do you see very much of Nellie? Quite a bit.I am very fond of Nellie Yes.She is sweet I am so glad we met again Denry That silly little misunderstanding, you know,it haunted me Has it? Money.It is so important, when you haven't got it and now we both got plenty and it doesn't matter The real thing is ambition isn't it? How do you mean? You want to be mayor,don't you? You see I couldn't be the youngest mayor this town ever had Could have been? Next year there will be too late for that this year there is the silly old Duncalf You do not want to upset him -I don't mind about that but.. -But what? I don't know I don't know if I can do it Denry.Don't you remember what I used to say to you? What was that? You can do anything,anything at all,if you want to enough You are that kind of man You really think so? Yes Well Mr Mayor it's yours again Well I must admit And this is the kind of show I am blamed for trying to put a stop to Well the weather doesn't help Don't make no difference what the weather is Bursley's team is a joke As long as long as we do not get any public support it will stay a joke They have the impertinence to organize meetings to condemn the directors The joke is over now.We are closing it down It's a pity about Thursday's meeting though We don't want the things become a political issue Politics don't come into it it's simply a matter of the shareholders interest being protected And I am going to say so I'll get them a meeting I'd like a word with your captain,Councilor Machin You'd better come with me There is only one thing wrong with football and it's not the football it's yourself For thirteen years now me and my co-directors have been losing money,our own money to provide this town with a professional football team and we warned you again and again what would happen if these matches weren't better patronized and now when you stalked the proved debt You call a meeting to complain about bad management Hello Denry I thought you were in Birmingham No It's all very well to talk but it doesn't get you anywhere Facts are the real talkers How are you going to get new blood with transfer fees as high as they are Would anybody at this meeting care to lend the club 1000 £ or so? Anybody? I thought not What you're asking for is not better management but something for nothing Mr Mayor,Mr Mayor May I say a few words on this subject? Step up on the platform,Councilor Machin Thanks I don't pretend to be an expert on football but I would like to say something about this question of new blood If I'm not mistaken one of the greatest modern footballer is a native of this town Callear That's right Callear is the man I mean The greatest centre forward in England Callear left this town when he was a boy and he's made the fortune in every club he has played for Liverpool City Your county Your county That's right and Birmingham he is the best there is Gentlemen I say that Callear ought to come back to his native town And Bursley's centre forward he'll lead us on to victory, all right,wouldn't he? I'm glad Councilor Machin admits that he has no knowledge of football That saves me the trouble of telling you Why don't you sit down! Trouble in using him that Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers have both made offers to Birmingham for Callear and now these two wealthy clubs are fighting it out between them and ask Callear back again to Bursley,why, steam engines and that Cigg himself couldn't do it Finished? Mr Callear would you mind stepping up a moment,so we all can have a look at you Well,gentlemen,we've got Mr Callear here without either the steam engine or His Majesty I suggest to the Directors of the Club that they accept him and try another season Wait a moment,wait a moment, what about the transfer? I forgot I signed him up in Birmingham this morning as a present for the club Please use applause for Machin It won't be Councilor Machin for long now,Denry Hello Mr Machin.We won,all right eh! Have you seen the news of Councilor Cotterill,terrible thing Bankrupt Cotterill bankrupt! Yes I know A petition was filed in Manchester, that's hardly would have been able to keep it a secret for so long Nellie herself didn't know it until the last week,she told me yesterday Why didn't tell me,I'd have helped them It wasn't just the money, it was talk of criminal procedures Why didn't you tell me? Let them go off like that Nellie made me promise not to. They didn't want to notify. They were ashamed Their relations in Canada sent them the money for the fare It seemed easier for them to just go without saying good bye But to Canada! They sail from Liverpool tomorrow,steerage Steerage? Nellie in the steerage? And Mr and Mrs Cotterill they only have a little money left for when they got there But they are sailing tomorrow afternoon,it's too late Oh,no,it isn't I can telegraph Liverpool for first class cabin, go off by train in the morning and make them change Steerage Denry all right,listen we are both friends of theirs Let's half the cost,you and I,and let's go together to Liverpool and see them off That's a very good idea We don't know how to thank you We couldn't let you go like that Mr and Mrs Cotterill Yes Would you please come and check your luggage Someday I hope to repay you Don't worry about that -Good Bye Denry -Good Bye Mrs Cotterill Now I really think we should go Yes -Good Bye,Nellie darling -Good Bye Ruth Good Bye Nellie Good Bye -Look out -Thank you Denry All ashore that is going ashore Time is getting short a minute,I left something to give you in,it's in the cab There isn't any time,the bell is..

Yes it is Your husband? My husband? No.Just friend I have no husband I think seeing somebody off myself Your wife? Oh,no,only my sister.I'm not married You are upset aren't you?

I'll hang Ruth.She can take care of herself Are you sure you are quite comfortable? Yes,thank you ,you are really very kind Not at all Where to,My Lord? Where can I take you? I'm staying at the Coronation Hotel What an extra ordinary co-incidence, I'm staying there too To the hotel,please,Brown Our leading citizen What great cause has he ever been identified with I think I can tell you that,Mr Duncalf It's quite simple,He's identified with a great cause of cheering us all up Look Denry Subtitles by Seglora
