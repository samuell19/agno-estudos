Are we there yet? There appears to be a wedding. Weddings always cause traffic jams. So annoying. GRANDMA Sis, Grandma keeps calling. What should I do? Just put your phone on silent. Let me answer. Hello, Grandma. Darling, where are you? We're almost there. - It's melting. - I know. - Have you bought the candles? - Yes, Grandma, we have. - You said... - Is it far away? There's still a lot of space on the left. I'm looking at it. Yes, Grandma. Please calm down. Tell Gendis to go through the usual shortcut. - Yes, Grandma, we're on the shortcut. - Turn right, then go to the alley. - Oh, you have? - Yes, we have. - Okay, darling. - Bye, Grandma. Please hurry! Time flies Without compromise Woke up in the morning It's already this late It feels like only yesterday My grandchildren Were sitting on my lap But time just runs too fast Instead of running free We're trapped Trapped in this narrow movement I remain still, but I'm tired My heart grows anxious The ambiance is suffocating This frustration makes me weary Cars and bikes are parked on the street Stuck without moving one bit Our path is blocked and now we're late Nothing left to do but contain our anger No car is moving I feel like screaming Everybody is becoming grumpy Boredom possesses the atmosphere When will all this end? Why don't we just walk there? Seriously? It's so polluted. Waiting in the car takes longer than walking. I think Bebe's right. We should just walk. Yes! we should've done this sooner. - Hey, you have to pay first. - Open the trunk first. Oh my God. You're on your own now. This emptiness Is not the end Seeing their lives blossom Shouldn't be a sad affair They're spreading their wings And flying high New beginnings await me And my three granddaughters! - Where's the money? - Oh yeah. It's not enough. I need more for all the singing. The car didn't even move one bit for so long. - Fine, just pray that I'll get rich. - Amen. Thanks. Bye. Tortured by all the noise My eardrums feel like bursting Jakarta, it's so hard to accept And we finally give up Car's honking everywhere Pollution fills the air That is noise pollution Let's put an end to this! Find something new Like walking or cycling Free from the suffocating traffic! No more suffocating No more suffocating No more suffocating No more suffocating No more suffocating Hey! - Mr. Subur! - Mr. Subur! - Please open the gate. - Open it. Grandma... - I think 23 looks nicer. - Stop it, Grandma. She's 32. Okay, but I pity her. Why are these records being sold? We have to keep them! How will we listen to them? I think Dad still has a gramophone... Think about it. If we play classic Indonesian love songs, combine that with one of your addictive welcome drinks, and foreigners are bound to be hooked! I don't do foreigners, darling. Yeah, 'cause you're into old local men, that's why! Surprise! - Well... - Hey! What should I wish for? Okay. I wish us all everlasting good health and for Grandma to be happier now that she's moving in with us. And lastly, for the garage sale to be a huge success. Wish for a husband. Also, I wish Grandma would stop annoying me about marriage. Amen! Don't say that. - Cut the cake! - Talking about love, why don't you ever tell me to get married? - It's always Gendis! - There you go, Grandma! You should never marry first. Your big sister is the priority. Don't jinx it! Hear, hear, we must obey... Grandma! All eight kids were adopted. - I'm just going to take these plates. - Seriously? It's Mason, right? I'm buying all of them. I'm glad the plates I used in my childhood are going to a family friend. I fell in love with these plates since my younger days dining with your Grandma. - The same plates? - Exactly the same! Take them all! What does your grandson do? He's in property. What a coincidence! Tell him to sell my house first and I will hook him up with my first granddaughter. - It fits. - How much is it? Thank you! - How about the blue one? - It's also 100. Two, three... Bima, you still have eyes for her? Stop taking pictures. Go shop at Ella's table! She wouldn't notice me from just buying a few things. I ought to buy the whole table. - Then buy the whole thing. - I don't have that kind of money. Speaking of which, where's Ella? - No worries. Just transfer the money. - OK, I will transfer the money. - Thank you, Grandma. - You're welcome. - Which one do you like? - This and that. - Hi, Manda. Shopping? - Hello. - Just browsing. - Okay. I'm a fan of woman like Manda. Her works have been translated into three languages. Amazing! But it's a pity that no man's brave enough to marry her. Oops! - Grandma, how could you? - Sorry. Hello. What are you getting? Not bad. Hope we get some commission from Grandma. - Can I help out with anything? - Help out over there. I feel alright because of my beautiful granddaughters. Looking good, Grandma. Where are you going? Well, we have a flight at 12, no? Yeah, but it's still seven o'clock, Grandma. Seven o' clock? Yup! I have to look good, even at home, you know. Unlike you three, only dressing well if you're going out! But at home, you're all messy. Bima, come closer. See, Bima smells nice. How about you? - Shower, shower, shower. - Shower! - Okay? - Roger that! Shower! - Go! - Got it, Grandma. Aren't they cute? Peekaboo. This is a story Of highs and lows The tale of us, the three sisters We live our lives with so much love And one day Love mesmerized us all When love comes unexpectedly The three sisters can't hardly resist Who would've thought Who would've guessed That the three sisters are falling in love Feeling restless day and night Longing for that first hint of light -This is the story of three sisters -Grandma! All three mesmerized by love Three sisters who can't resist love When we are too mesmerized by love Who would've thought Who would've guessed That the three sisters know love Feeling restless day and night Longing for that first hint of light Yeah This is the story of three sisters -All three mesmerized by love -Let's go! Three sisters who can't resist love When we are too mesmerized By love - Bye. - Take care. Jefri! - How are you doing, Mr. Krisna? - Good. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Have to pick up my mother and kids from the airport. Let's drink some rice wine first. The older I get, the worse I get at handling Moke. I'll just have some coffee. Can I help you? Thanks, sir, but we can handle this on our own. Darling Bebe, just pay the porter. Come here, sir. Relax, Grandma. This is easy. Relax, Grandma. This is easy. - Here, take it and help my granddaughters. - Okay. Which ones are yours? You don't have to Grandma. I'm so happy. Look, so many bags. How can she handle that? Thank you, sir. Dad! Hello, dear. - Did we make you wait long? - I arrived just in time. You guys needed a porter just for this? Aren't you three strong enough to carry your bags? - Krisna. - Yes, Mom. If you keep treating them like that, they'd get a hernia. Stop treating them like boys. From now on, they should be more ladylike. Grandma, am I not ladylike enough? You are. It's just that your dad is irritating. - Okay, Mom. - But why are you so skinny? Hard work, of course. Good, then. But the ones we just ordered were new, how come the aircon's acting up already? Three ACs are jammed. I want them to be replaced. So annoying. Stop it. Grandma, I'm working for the hotel. Krisna, look at your kids. They're all busy with themselves. We're a family, you know. We're supposed to communicate, talk about Jakarta. How were your experiences there? Jakarta's traffic is the worst. Even cats know that Jakarta's traffic is horrible. But it really is the worst. The garage sale was alright, Dad. And I brought all of your vintage LPs. Thank you, darling. But Gendis almost sold them. We made about three million rupiahs. Right, Grandma? Maumere. She's asleep. So much for telling us to communicate. Only when she's sleeping does she look harmless. Wake her up. Let's take her to Geliting market. I think she's too tired. Let her sleep. Look, I think she just prayed. She must've woken up already earlier. But there are many live pigs at the market. She'd faint if she were to walk next to a pig. Let's go. Slowly but surely, step by step We begin our day in Geliting market Shopping for natural products Without chemical adulterants Fresh fruits and vegetables Free range animals too Hello, dear carnivores and omnivores Anything you could wish for Is here, at Geliting market Ladies, young and old Mingle in the crowd, doing business They are the family breadwinners There's even gossip of all sorts Everything's available here At Geliting market How are you, Mrs. Maria? Fine, Ms. Gendis. Look, these are what Gendis wants. How much is each? It's 2,500. How about the small one? You should thank Gendis. Her father just bought our land. Yeah, my dad really likes that spot. - He's going to build a retirement house. - Hey. You should invite their entire family to your wedding. I'd really like to go. I've never attended a traditional Maumere-style wedding. I bet the cloth and ivory offerings for the bride are unique. Not only did the bride's family ask for ivory, they also asked for a horse, a pig, and many more. - It gives me a headache. - Why? A lot of our possessions had to be sold to finance the wedding. Well, what can you do? You have to follow tradition. I'll be going. Talking about marriage is always gruesome A lot of sacrifices have to be made You have to sell your land and property All for a mere ceremony What good is a cloth Ivory, pig, or horse? Is love really only worth that much? Tradition is so complicated There's a ritual to everything But no ritual can guarantee Everlasting equal love Between a man and a woman Not only here in Geliting But in the entire world Well, at least they're enjoying it. This hotel is very significant to their lives. If you always confine them to this hotel, when will they get married? Especially Gendis. She's already at a fitting age to have kids. All my friend's granddaughters are already mothers. Can't blame me for also wanting a great-grandchild. Just let it flow. Whoever of them gets engaged first is fine. I don't think I'm fit to be a grandfather, either. You are hallucinating! Krisna, please look at my Snapchat! You've arrived? - OK, I'll go to the lobby. - Is your mom there? Bye. Who was it? My business friends, Mom. They want to check out the property around here. Your business friends? Can any of them be hooked up with Gendis? A match for Gendis. A match for Gendis. I will make sure you get another room. - Well, as soon as you can. - That guest... It's done, Dad. Give the suite to Dad's friends, okay? Only for two days, no more, they've been booked by a guest from Bandung. - Really? - Yes. - Your welcome drink. - Okay. - Okay, then. - Oh yeah, Dad! And that Bandung guest's motorbike just arrived. I want to take a look. Just come here when it's empty. Hi. How are you? Hey. Hai ya ampun. You're so tanned. So adorable. Ella's coming. Where's the welcome drink? Why are you still here? Wempi took care of it already. No, no. You go and ask Gendis for it. - Now, Bebe. - Okay, okay. - Oh, please. - I got it. Oh my God! Is this a nightmare or what? - Hey! - Grandma. Dear Lord, what is this? Grandma, this is Erick, one of our hotel's first guests. He just returned from a trip to Flores. Good afternoon, Grandma. Erick, you can speak Indonesian? Where did you come from? I'm half British and half Indonesian, Grandma. So, you are a "half-half"? Oh dear. Why aren't you working? The hotel's packed and you are busy with this half-half guy. I was just on my way to the kitchen to get some welcome drinks. A welcome drink for him? Okay, I'm going now. Hey, you, half-half. Oh my God! What was all that? I'll deliver the order to table three, okay? Erick, you still remember my sister Gendis? Waiter. All boys are trouble to you. Now he's back in Indonesia. Not all boys are like your ex, you know. Stubborn little girl. Why are all of you girls flirtatious with our hotel guests? I thought this was a family hotel, but it turns out the owner's daughters can date the guests. This is all giving me a headache. Who actually thinks that, Mom? Like father like daughter. As a father, you have to think of proper men for your daughters. I don't want Dad to arrange my date. I can find my own man. Remember, you have to find a proper one. Don't fall for shady hipster types. They may seem cool but barely have any money. - No assets. - Who doesn't have assets? Because of Bebe, Grandma's been cranky. Look, Be! What have you done? The German guests really liked Gendis' cooking. Hey, Grandma, what do you think about Erick? Oh my God, Erick again. Bebe, I am old-fashioned and you are new-fashioned. - What is that? - You are millennials. So, I just want to talk to you. So, I just realized that you are 19 already. You want to start dating. But you have to respect yourself. Okay, Grandma. I know you're just saying it, but I know you don't care. I learned a lot from the guests. About their cultures and how life is in their homelands. Erick's culture! What's his job, by the way? Seems weird to me, he's on such a long vacation without working. You should just talk to him, interview him directly, so you can find out the details. That'd just be a waste of time. Now, I want to focus on you, Gendis. Why are you always in the kitchen? You should mingle with the guests. Who knows, the one for you may be among them. How contradictory. You were afraid of the hotel's image, now you want her to get flirty with the guests. This is a special rule. Only for Gendis. There you go, sista! - Nabilla, can you get me the green beans? - Right away. Thank you. Oh my God, this kitchen is still busy. Here, let me take over the food presentation. What are you doing, Grandma? I'm busy working. No worries. No worries. Where are you going, Grandma? Your father has guests. All of them are businessmen. I can't. There are still way too many orders. Relax, dear. Your face is kind of oily. Give your pretty smile, please. The weather is nice out there. - Grandma, I don't feel like it. - It's fine. - Bebe! Take care of those orders. - Yeah? Okay. Good afternoon. Here's my oldest granddaughter. Her name is Gendis. She's the chef who cooked all your meals. I hope my cooking is to your liking. The fish is a little bland, isn't it? Really, sir? - Yeah. It needs a little bit of this! - Let's try it. Now that's more like it! Oh, he likes it spicy. Hello. My name is Felix. It's a pity I married young. If I had known Krisna's daughter would be this pretty, I wouldn't have married that early. But if my wife gives her consent, I'd like to find a second wife. Hey, watch it. Even if your wife gives her consent, I wouldn't allow my granddaughter to be somebody's second wife. My apology. Excuse me. I have to go back to the kitchen. You are full of bullshit, you know? Enough, mom. Enough. Hey, the orders are piling up. Is this my fate As a single woman? Pressured to meet Unworthy men Is this my fate As a single woman? All for the pride Of my family This is the 21st century The world is filled with independent women Being single should No longer be a taboo No longer a taboo No longer a taboo Is this my fate As a single woman? The truth is I still believe in love That will come when it's meant to But I'm not afraid of living alone I enjoy Living freely Filling my days Doing the work I love What took you so long to come? I thought you weren't coming. I almost gave the room to another guest. So, I'm getting the suite? No way! You get the cheapest room. Grandma! - You're getting prettier! - And you more handsome too. Darling, Bima is here to take photos of the hotel, right? That's right! You have to do a good job, or else - I am going to punish you. - Ouch. Yeah, our Instagram has to be popular, and it's entirely your responsibility! - Roger, beautiful! - Beautiful! - Come on. - Pretty. - Bye, Grandma. - Bye. When are we going to the village of Watubo? That comes later, okay? We should focus on the hotel property first. Nat, yesterday, I came across a guest who went into suite 303. Has he shown up today? - Oh, I believe that's Mr. Yudha. - His name is Yudha, then? He went out this morning to visit Kelimutu Lake. Oops. It's too late then. Hello. I want to buy your fresh catch. - Are these mullets? - Yeah, this is our catch of the day. Snapper? I want the mullet. - All of them? - Add that one, black grouper. I want all three. Ouch! I'm so sorry, miss. Speeding is forbidden here! Besides, this is a crowded marketplace, so, you should be careful when you ride a bike. I didn't know that this is a market. How can you not know? It's crowded as hell here. What good is dirty fish, huh? What's wrong with you? I'm sorry, but did you park your car without locking it? It's safe in Maumere. There aren't any thieves or delinquents. Although now, it may not be so safe with the presence of reckless tourists like you! I'm so sorry. Darling, what happened to you? Where's your shopping basket? A bike almost ran me over. Everything in my basket fell. - It's this bad. - Poor you. - Just ask the guy to take responsibility. - Yeah, that's right. What for? Ignorant tourists who think they're cool just because they ride big bikes. Hello, Mr. Yudha. - Did you go to Kelimutu, sir? - Good evening. Yeah, I just arrived. - So, this is Mr. Yudha? - Yes, Grandma, this is him. Just call me Grandma. - Hello, Grandma. - Hello. Huh? Who is this guy? Why do you all know him? - Handsome, no? - Not. Gendis, please meet Mr. Yudha. He is our guest from Bandung. No need to call me mister. Yudha is fine. I'm sorry. There was a little incident. Yeah. A little incident, he said? Didn't your bike arrive here a couple of days before you did? I heard you're going on a Flores road trip with your bike? - Yes. - How awesome! That bike is exactly the one that almost ran me over. I sincerely apologize once again. Here, I've replaced your fish with new ones. You should accept Yudha's apology, Gendis. Oh yes, have you two properly introduced yourselves? No, I have not. Yudha, this is my oldest granddaughter, Gendis. She's the hotel chef. I'm the second oldest granddaughter, Ella. I'm Bebe, the youngest granddaughter. - Hello, Bebe. Yudha. - This is Gendis, the first one. Yeah. - So, that's my Gendis. - Right, Grandma. Okay, Grandma. I'm going to give him a little tour of the hotel. - No, I will come along. - You're coming with us? Please escort me to my room. I'm sleepy. - Walk next to me. - Let's go. Thank you, Mr. Yudha. Grandma, how come you're all dressed up but sleepy? The best! Gendis is definitely the best cook. You like it? I cooked that. Seriously? Not bad. I didn't season it with anything. If it had lived in polluted waters, it wouldn't be anywhere near that savory. You're so rese. "Rese" is when you have to ask what "rese" means. - Wow. - Who wants to have a taste? I want to try. Mr. Krisna, I'm Yudha Palle. From Nusantara Hotelier. I wrote an e-mail to you before. His full name is Yudha Palle. Palle is a traditional Maumere family name. Ella, please try this. It is so good. Yudha, have a bite. So annoying. Can I try this out? Oh, go ahead. - That's Gendis' cooking. - Thank you. Grandma told me a lot of stories. So, this hotel not only has a cool location, good design, and international standards, it also has a special chef. Special how? I'm just normal. Special cooking. Special position too, being the daughter of the owner. Chefs like that are rare. I'm not only the owner's daughter, I'm also this property's part-owner. It's different. Oh, yes, yes. Who likes to shop at the market for herself. I bet that's a sign of a down-to-earth character, but then, you're also the oldest child, so you're bound to be quite bossy. Okay, and you, Yudha Palle, are actually not a regular tourist but a native of Maumere who likes to make smartass analyses. Hey, hey, I want to join the chat. Go ahead and chat. I want to clean the kitchen. What about the fish? My sister can be quite mean. The two of us are very different. You're mean a lot of the time too, you know. I'm Yudha, sorry. I didn't introduce myself. I'm Bima. I was Ella's neighbor when they lived in Jakarta. We used to ride bicycle together in our underwear. Don't trust what he says about us, okay? His judgment is biased. Have you had a drink? There's some delicious iced coconut water. You should definitely have a taste. Thank you. I want some too. If you want some, get it yourself. Here. Don't take her seriously. Ella is always competing with Gendis. Thank you, Bebe. You understand me very well. Of course I do. - Thank you. - Hi. Can you please take this? Bila. Please give this to Bima and Erick's diving group. Okay. - Be! Come here. - What's wrong? Look at this! Wow, somebody is doing a background check, just like a P.I. Shut up! Why don't you click "add friend" and follow each other? No way. That's degrading. He already follows you, you know. I was asked to check up on him by Grandma. Anyway, I smell something fishy here. Why? What is his real intention in coming to our hotel? Look here. His company, Hotelier Nusantara Group, focuses on Boutique Hotel investment in this country, just like our hotel. Look. From Jakarta to Samarinda... So, you suspect that he's here, not only for a vacation? Who knows what he's up to. But we should warn Dad. I wouldn't want him to be manipulated by Yudha's charming smile. Oh, so Yudha's smile is charming now? All you have to do is click on "follow request", then you can look at all the photos of Yudha's charming smile. Do you want me to click it for you? Bebe! No. You are so annoying! I was born and raised in Bandung. My late father brought me here once when I was small, but I never came back until now. It feels sad to not know your roots. I am touched by the story of your childhood. I studied hospitality at Bandung University, you know. Really? When... Well, by the way, did your parents have different religions when they got married? Mom. That's Yudha's privacy. You don't need to ask. I'm only curious. It's okay. I'm used to it. Discussing religion shouldn't have to be awkward. My late father became a Muslim, Grandma. Really? Okay. - Morning! - Morning! Wow. Wow, my pretty granddaughter. I have to go teach. Teach? What do you teach? English at Sikka Village. Sikka Village The one with the Portuguese church, right? The church is really nice, you know. How about you and I take Bebe to her teaching job, then I can accompany you sightseeing? What a rare offer. You've never taken me to or picked me up from my teaching job. So? I'd love to, but I've already got plans. Oh, that's fine. Some other time then. But you're still going to take me to Sikka, right, Ella? What day is it, by the way? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. It's Tuesday. I just remembered that I have tons of work to do downstairs. Ella's busy. Excuses, excuses. Bye, everyone. Take care, darling. Have something to eat. Later, Dad. Yudha, do you want more food? Something sweet, maybe? No, thanks, Ella. Let's go to Gendis' kitchen and help her prepare lunch. Grandma. Just a moment, Yudha. Grandma, I don't want to. It seems nice to be surrounded by women, sir. Yes, it's a different kind of joy. Don't be too flirty, Ella dear. Oh my God, Grandma. I love you, Grandma, but this is 2016. It is my decision to flirt with whoever I choose. Besides, there are no signs indicating Gendis likes Yudha. I'm not going to let my chances with a guy like him go to waste. My, oh my. Ella. Gendis is shy when it comes to things like that. Please give the opportunity for her to become close with Yudha. What about me? When will I have the opportunity? Oh, sugar baby, beautiful baby. Later, after Gendis! Do you want her to die a virgin because you keep overstepping her? You're being superstitious. It's not fair to me. What's superstitious? This is the curse Of being the second child The oldest is prioritized before me But I still have to give up To the youngest It's so hard to just be myself It's not easy to make my own decisions Listen World I also want to obtain love I want to be loved Though no one seems to understand me I want to be loved Though no one seems to understand me Ella? Why are you lying down in the lobby? Let's go inside. Shut up! I'll give you love with all my heart Because I understand you Your change. Follow that car! Faster, faster. Where's your teeth? So smart! Let's do it again. We say A We say E We say U We say A Language Humanity's greatest creation We get to know more about each other Language There are so many Different languages on earth We get to embrace diversity And now, let's sing again We say A We say I We say E All of us say O Language, humanity's greatest creation All of us Say O Gendis, don't forget to lock your car and close its windows. Can't believe you're still paranoid. It's safe around here. What are you doing anyway? It's quite a coincidence that we meet here. I've come to look at the Portuguese church. It reminds me of my childhood. I thought you were planning to turn this place into a hotel too. - Be... - Hi. Did you two make plans to meet here? Plans? No way. We met by chance. We're going straight home. Yudha's gonna reminisce at the church nearby. Come on, Be. Wow. I know a lot of stories about that church. - Oh yeah? - Do you want us to accompany you? Can't. Have to go back to the hotel and work. If you are willing, I'd love to. Fine, but you two go on ahead. - I'm going home. - Please, my dear sister. But I came here with a motorbike cab. - How will Bebe get home later? - Yes, how? Why is it now, of all times, that you didn't bring your annoying bike? Fine. - Let's go. Don't take too long. - Okay. Be. I get that I accidentally made a bad first impression on her, but why does she still insist on being mean to me? Gendis is like this church's old wooden door. It's durable. It's also thick, dry, and worn-out. Worn-out? Even if you knock on it, it's hard to hear the sound from the inside. - Good afternoon, Father. - Good afternoon. Hey, do you know? This church's designer is the same as the one who designed Jakarta Cathedral. It hasn't changed one bit, huh? I remember back then, my late father and grandpa brought me here to enjoy the serenity. - Really? - Yeah. Whenever my students' choir group sings here, it's always very beautiful. Gives you chills. You should watch them one day. For sure. When was the last time you came here? When I was... I think I was around ten years old. After the tsunami, my Grandfather died. His requiem Mass took place here. He was ten during the 1992 tsunami, so that means he's 33 this year! What a match! Why are you being so annoying? Just approach him. He's fragile right now. His sign is Cancer. That means he's emotional. We're lucky there are still a lot of cakes leftover that you made. I can't! I feel sorry for him. I don't want to. - Please. - Why don't you give this to him? Okay. We do it together. Bebe. You hold this! - Stay close! - Okay. Communion? Lekun! This cake is called Lekun. I know what it's called. I used to eat this when I was small, you know. Which one is your great-grandmother's? Not sure. This one, if I'm not mistaken. - Where? - Here. Yeah, it's this one. I forgot to bring flowers. Wait. I'm going back to the car for a bit. You're coming back, right? I'm not as mean as you think. Just wait here. You're leaving already? Move over. What are you doing? I need these flowers for Yudha's great-grandma's grave. So, you're asking for her blessing? Shut up! Gosh. Let's tag along. I don't want to be a third wheel. Fine with me. Somebody is very enthusiastic. How did you manage to find flowers? They were in my car's trunk, for the hotel's bouquet. But you can use them. So, your car's trunk is like Doraemon's pocket? Thank you very much. Today has been very enjoyable. I hope you enjoyed it too. Yeah, it's been alright. Since I was little, I've been raised to be happy when I see others happy. It's almost a draw. It's almost dawn. I have a lot of work to prepare for the grand opening. Don't be "gombal". What a sweet-talker! Sweet-talker! TO REPLACE YOUR FLOWERS Woohoo. That must be from Yudha. You're such a busybody. How many did you give yesterday? Yesterday was only six. This is three times six. - Smartass! - Let me see the card. - Bebe. - Grandma. Bebe, where have you been? Why has your room been empty since early morning? You should pick up the phone whenever I call. I was jogging by the beach. Jogging barefoot, without shoes? Your hair's soaking wet. Jogging barefoot is my way of directly transferring my love energy to the sand, Grandma. Also, I love to jump straight into the water afterwards. Fine then. You haven't finished telling me the story about Yudha and Gendis last night. You were snoring by the time the story got intense. Don't gossip in front of the person you're gossiping about! It's better this way, right? It's better to do it in front of you rather than stab you in the back. But I think there are much better places for a first date than a graveyard! It's bad energy. It's not a date! It's just a coincidence that we ran into each other. I don't think it's a coincidence. He might've stalked Gendis all the way to Sikka. If he truly did, that's totally freaky! Bebe. Take note. We need sugar. So, will you spend time with Yudha again today? No. I have to re-stock our inventory. Bebe and I can take care of that. Grandma, I already promised Erick to teach him cloth weaving today. Let Erick learn by himself. Grandma, only girls learn weaving here. Can't a foreigner interested in the culture learn it? There should be equal opportunities. Where is my equal opportunity when it comes to forcing me to marry? Bebe! Continue the story now. You don't want to move from this house, Auntie? No, my dear. When was the last time you fixed the roof? Ten years ago, your uncle sent money from Java. You don't have to worry. I will fix this house for you. You are just like your late grandpa. Are you married? Not yet. - Girlfriend? - Not yet. Fiance? Not yet. Please pray for me so I can find my match. And I can be like you and uncle. I will. I have to go now. Take care. The room for Ms. Manda has been confirmed. I want to see Tenun. There are a lot of events for the grand opening. Can I go on an excursion? You can go on an excursion to the nearby island. - OK, bye. - Keep in touch. Why didn't you show up at breakfast? Early this morning, I went to visit my family's house. Oh yes, we're still going to see Tenun Village today, right? Sure, but aren't you busy? Isn't the grand opening happening soon? Yudha. Huh? My English is terrible, but you're asking me to do it? Why are you so grumpy? It's just that my English is not good. Where is Natali? You can ask her to stand by here at the reception. I want to hang out with Dad and Yudha. But which of these pictures do you want to upload? Why don't we choose these together over coffee? Just e-mail them to me. I'll take care of it later. You can knit? Don't bullshit me. I'm not lying. Are you done? So neat. Thank you. It's so good. Add some chili. Or do you want this? Which dish is the hardest to prepare? That one. Your sister's so meticulous. She has to taste every dish here to prepare the hotel's grand opening menu. Yeah. To find the right menu. She's such a perfectionist. Now, imagine her finding a husband. That's why I like simplicity. Just like you, Ella. What's with you? It's fish seared in a sweet and sour soup. Taste this. It's enough? Try it. What you normally make is already close to this. No. I wonder why? I follow the recipe. Seasoning, the amount to use, everything. Still, the taste is off. Do you want my opinion about your cooking? Wrong question. Oh? Sure, sure. You know a lot about food? I may not be a food critic, but as a culinary enthusiast... Well, at least you've been to many Michelin star restaurants. I think your cooking is perfect. Absolutely perfect. To a point that there's something missing. What's that? Imperfection. The element of surprise. That's what makes life beautiful. The things outside the calculation, the flaws that actually serve to make something complete. Ella. Let's wear the traditional clothes together. With me. What? You think you're here on a vacation? Go and take some pictures! Pictures of the traditional dance are a welcome addition to the hotel website. I took a lot of shots already. Take more! Yudha. Please wear this sarong and we can dance. Come on! No. I'm a bad dancer. Off beat. Come on. I'll help you. Here. Wow, you look nice. Nothing fits. They're either too small or too big. Search my trunk. I sew those myself. Copied from a Mode Blaad. What's Mode Blaad, Grandma? It's a glossy magazine, and inside, they gave us a bonus pattern. This is yours. I love this one. It reminds me of Brigitte Bardot. I wore that one when I danced with Bing Slamet. I want that one. This dress suits you more, Gendis. Ella should have it. I'll wear this. Ella, Bebe, come sit here! Hey, listen. From now on, you two shouldn't tag along whenever Gendis spends time with Yudha. Let the two of them have their privacy. Yudha's the one who often asks us to tag along. The more the merrier, Grandma. Well, of course, there's no way he'd forbid any of you from coming. That's why, next time, you should just leave Gendis and Yudha alone. Stop bothering them. Yes, my matriarch. Matriarch? These are all prepared by Gendis. Wow, awesome. Please, you must eat! I'd love to. So, here's... - Yudha. - Hi. Do I look pretty? You're always pretty, regardless of what you're wearing. Come along for the excursion trip to the nearby island tomorrow, okay? We can party, sunbathe, and... - Definitely. - Promise? - Promise? I'll wait for you. - Sure. Just a moment. - Just a moment, please. - Alright. You look different. Gorgeous. Thank you. How's the food? I wonder. Do the guests like it? Is it still too... perfect? Come on. Can you please not act cynical towards me for just one night? Okay. I keep hearing the guests praising your cooking. And now, the food is almost gone. What? Gone? I can't let this happen. I have to go to the kitchen. I can't. I have to manage this. Didn't you say that your kitchen staff is the best? I can't. I have to manage this. You should have some faith in them. Wine for you, Grandma? I don't drink. Please pass it on to all the guests. Thanks. Oh my, Gendis. - Let's stop by at that boat. - Okay. Give me some octopus. - Which one is fresh? - All of them. So, this one. - How much is it? - Forty thousand. Wow, that's cheap. You're such a Metropolitan man. All is cheap for you. But they are rather monstrous. Let's go. Please put this on me, Bim! With all my pleasure. How is it? Clean already? Perfect. Can I swim now? I never stopped you from swimming to begin with. Well, true. How about you swim as well? You go first. I'll jump in later. Okay. Do you think Gendis is attracted to Yudha? I'm not sure about your sister, but I'm very sure that Yudha likes Gendis very much. Do you need any help? Never mind. It'll be ready soon. I was looking for you this morning, but you left already. Did you make plans to go with Yudha? No, he was just ready at the boat before I knew it. I went to your room, but you were still asleep. You should've just woken me up. Or maybe you are falling for him already? I don't believe that a person can fall in love in just a few days, okay? That's just your own theory. That's why people believe in love at first sight. Well, okay, okay. Chill, sista. I salute the husband and wife who take care of this mangrove forest. Ever since the tsunami, he took the initiative to plant all this by himself. A date with you really is something else, huh? In Bandung, a date usually means going to a boutique in a mall. If we were in Bandung, I'd have asked you to take me shopping for kitchen utensils. Browsing for a pressure cooker and fryer. I'm really proud of you. Why? Yours and your sisters. Maybe it all reminds us of our mother. We don't want her positive vibes to be gone. - Your mom's also an amazing chef, right? - She was awesome. - Your dad told me that. - Really? A lot of the recipes I use were passed down to me from my mom. I want to be as good as she was. I also want a bigger kitchen with a sous chef and more staff members. I mean, for now, the hotel's kitchen is fine the way it is, but we need to anticipate how things will develop in the future, right? However, the saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I don't know. I hope you're not acrophobic. I climbed up here once, with Bebe. But you haven't with me. Wow. It's so wonderful. There are no regrets once you are up here. It's beautiful indeed. Thank you for showing me around. You are welcome. Because of your collective effort, we are fully booked for three months ahead! Don't forget. This also means more work for all of us. It's always work. When are my granddaughters getting married? We need more recruitment for all divisions, be it housekeeping, reception, or kitchen. Dad, it's fine. I can still handle the work. Yeah, how are we going to pay for that? Dad and I have thought things through carefully. Dad has a surprise for you two. Ella and I agreed that we're going to sell some of the hotel's shares to... Yudha. What? That means I can have my own penthouse built! We can have our own bungalow for weaving classes! And for you, Gendis, Yudha will build a floor dedicated to a state-of-the-art kitchen, with a sous chef and staff members you can hand-pick yourself. It's okay, sis. You are allowed to scream joyfully. Yup. How dare that Yudha. I don't agree with any of this. What's the matter, dear? Why do we need an extra wing? And bungalows nonsense! Our hotel will become just like his other investments. Why do we have to be so insecure about a place that we've built together? If Mom was still alive, she would never approve of your idea! Think before you speak! You guys should think before you act. You've all been fooled by Yudha! He may seem nice, charming, and always available for you, but he's nothing but a thief. Gendis! Don't call your future husband a thief. What future husband? Well, actually... he did ask for my permission to propose to you. He told me he's going to propose to you tomorrow. Yudha is proposing to Gendis? This is so unfair! Ella. But I didn't see this coming. He won't plan on proposing to you if there were no positive signs from you. You must have been dating him behind my back. In the meantime, you let me flirt with him. You let me flirt with him and be affectionate to him. No, it's not like that. You're the one the family puts first all the time. Ella. You're the head chef. You're the one with the vision for this hotel. Even Yudha only acknowledges you. What about me? Dad! Kris, you've been focusing too much on business. How could you leave us in the dark? Why did it have to come to this? Just find the ring in another store, but send me the picture first. Yes, through WhatsApp tonight. - Okay, sir. - Yeah. - I'll send it now. - Thank you. Hey, how did you know I was here? Turns out you only got close to me and my family for business! Oh, is this about buying your hotel's shares? Don't laugh! You got me all wrong. Wrong, how? I initially came here with the sole intention of doing business. But as I got to know you and your family, I got attached to you and your lovely family, sincerely. Yeah, right? Why didn't you tell me about your intention to buy our shares? I didn't know that Mr. Krisna had a talented and beautiful daughter who I'd meet by accident. Excuses. You came into my family's lives out of the blue, showing off your wealth by having your big bike sent here, and forcing your charming smile on all of us, including Ella. You tried to buy this family. And what's worse, you tried to buy this family through me! You think a woman nowadays will just blindly accept when a man proposes because he got her father's approval? Please calm down, Gendis. Gendis, why does everything have to have a reason? How long have we even been acquainted? Gendis, isn't it possible that despite the wall you've built around you, there is a chance for me to look for a way in and reach you? So I could see your heart's kitchen? Hey. I want to be alone right now. Ella, are you okay? Gosh, what are you doing? I've been your shoulder to cry on since the old days, you know. Yudha is going to propose to Gendis. It's so unfair. I don't want to talk. I'm not in the mood. The universe always has a way Of showing itself to its inhabitants Love is all around Men aren't worthy of a woman's tears There are many more of them here At this shore From America, Barcelona, to Jakarta Men aplenty, from all over the world But if not a single one of them Is right for you I'll always be here, awaiting your love You're as close to perfection As it gets to me Your laugh, your anger, and your ambition All inspire me The universe always has a way Of showing itself to us Love is all around You're as close to perfection As it gets to me Your laugh, your anger, and your ambition All inspire me The universe always has a way Of showing itself to us Love is all around You're up so early. I have to go. Where to? Please tell the rest of your family I'm sorry for having to leave. I'll transfer everything I have to pay. I'd appreciate it if I could leave my stuff here for the time being. But why? I need some time alone. - No, please don't go. - Take care. I will arrange for my stuff to be picked up later. No, you can't. Be. Okay. So long, Be. But Yudha. Clean this dusty table, please! My grumpy morning lady. Want to have breakfast at the beach? Come on. Why is my heart Filled with longing? Hollow, directionless And devoid of hope The morning freshens me no more It is mute and exhausting Yet in this silent morning I'm reminded of the memories I yearn to sing a song An old song It's not only a memory Not a hollow memory Why is my heart Filled with longing? Because it is reminded Of you I yearn to sing a song An old song It's not only a memory Not a hollow memory Why is my heart Filled with longing? Because it is reminded Of you Yudha just came over. Why didn't you tell me? Huh? I thought you said you didn't want to see him again. Yeah. What I meant was, if I had met him, I could have told him off again. Gosh. He was here to pick up the things he left here. And to leave that postcard for you. And where is he now? He went back to the harbor to wait for a ferry. He said he was headed to Kupang next. From Yudha, yeah? Why do you have to be grumpy for so long? What else, Be? Here, make it pretty. Gendis needs some encouragement. Here. When else will you get this kind of opportunity? What do you mean? Chasing a guy before his ferry departs, during the climax of a movie's third act. - Bebe! - And all for the sake of love. Come on. Hurry! Wait!! Good luck! Hi. Hi. How did you know where I was? I... want to return this. What's this? You left this, right? On my kitchen island? Before you left. This is not from me. Oh? But Bebe said... Bebe! Sweet. Too sweet. Does coffee have to be bitter? Now what? I'm clueless. Unlike in the kitchen, where everything's certain, I'm confident. No recipe is guaranteed to succeed. Because there is an X-factor in life. Given that, I don't see why our relationship necessarily has to be perfect. But why should we skip the drama either? It's exhausting. Isn't that one of the essences of a relationship? Of life itself? Well, if you want an explosive relationship full of drama, you should just be with Ella. I'm just afraid of disappointment. Remember when you were just learning how to cook? How many times you accidentally cut yourself? Did it hurt? Do you really need to ask? So, bottom line, you're asking me... to train... our chopping skills together? Is that it? Are you willing to chop some vegetables with me, with the risk of cutting our fingers, with no guarantee that the dish will be delicious? True, and at this spot too. True, it's certainly the weirdest one I've made. Too many people Lets recite Al-fatihah to the bride and the groom, or pray accordingly to your religion. Thank you. - Dad. - Thank you. -Just let it go, Grandma -What do you mean "let go"? At least someone is tying the knot in our family. I'd rather go back to Jakarta. I'd get a stroke if I spend too much time on this island. Don't say that. How did you two end up meeting again? Actually, we met again through Facebook. After that, we just kept in touch through Snapchat, FaceTime, and WhatsApp. Wow, you two are so millennial! Let's say hi. Gendis should've married first, not her dad! He never gave me a heads up and suddenly it's his wedding. Congratulations, sir. Let's congratulate them, Grandma! They're supposed to come here, not the other way around. And that old neighbor of mine is pretty sneaky, dating my son behind my back. Is it painful? This is what you get from chopping carrots backward. Next lesson is to chop some onions. Ella, seeing us both in these traditional clothes makes me impatient for when it's our turn to... To do what? Will you marry me? Oh no. Not at Dad's wedding! I have some news for you. - You... How many months has it been? - Only three months. I don't want you to feel trapped. So, not only because of this pregnancy. We also have to come up with a strategy. This is a story Of highs and lows The tale of us, the three sisters We live our lives with so much love And one day Love mesmerized us all When love comes unexpectedly The three sisters can't hardly resist Who would've thought, who would've guessed That the three sisters are falling in love Feeling restless day and night Longing for that first hint of light This is the story of three sisters All three mesmerized by love How can we resist love When we are too mesmerized by love? Who would've thought, who would've guessed That the three sisters know love Feeling restless day and night Longing for that first hint of light This is the story of three sisters All three mesmerized by love Three sisters who can't resist love When we are too mesmerized by love Oh, the three sisters Grandma, you still want great-grandchildren, right? Like your friends? Great-grandchildren? Of course. It's been my dream, but it doesn't matter now which of the three of you marries first. Be it Ella or Gendis, there's no use rushing it or... What's the word? Stepping over someone else. What about me, Grandma? - So, you're like... - Yes. Oh, God have mercy. Grandma. Grandma. Hey, Gendis, Ella, help me with Grandma! Wake up, Grandma! What's wrong with Grandma, Be? Grandma! What's wrong, Be? I just broke the news to Grandma. - Hey. - What? It's because of you. Grandma, I love you. Please wake up. Really? So, I have to wake up? Grandma, you almost gave me a heart attack. ‪Shopping for natural products It's chemical-free Fresh vegetables, fresh fruits The animals are also fresh Hello, carnivores Also for the omnivores Whatever you want It's available at Geliting Market Women, young and old They're selling modestly They are responsible For their family's economy Talks about the family's recipes And about the neighbors Just go And shop At Geliting Market
