Tell me, brother... "He's asked you to pack & come, dear!" "We've discussed..." Thank you... so much, brother! "For now, He' asked you to enter as a Maid!" "Understand & act accordingly, dear! "Staying alive is more important than staying connected!" "Remember to inform the boy tactfully, before getting here!" "There can't be any trouble because of you, dear!" "...mind you!" Sure, brother! I shall explain him! We're going to meet, Father! Father? Come, lets go... Sure... Please return my earrings... "You've redeemed it, already?!" Take... "Remember, you can never call him, Father!" "It might ruin your schooling & education!" "You're still not finished...?" "Ma..." Come on... Ma! Let us play for a while! Whenever I call, you keep giving excuses! "but you just continue working!" I shall come soon, dear! "But when, Ma...?" Where've you been, Ma? You were here, when we went to sleep! It's nothing, dear! ...you go to sleep! I thought of what I'd spoken, last night! I made a mistake, calling you here! Enough of posing as a Maid in your own house! -our gun for generations! It is gold-plated! ...even today, it'd fetch Fifty-Sixty thousand! Here, Keep it! Take it & leave! You can't be here, anymore! I trusted you & mothered your child! ...not this gold! If I stay alone Rogues come to mess around! ...there is your Son, too! Now look... Just tie the knot! & I shall continue with what I'm doing, already! N-No... Take this & leave! "Dear, where've you gone now?" "...are you deaf to my screams?" "Come here, now!" "Oh no..." "Had safeguarded it for, generations!" ...but is missing on this auspicious day! "Who'd have taken it? Uh-Oh... no... It is an invaluable asset! It was a gift to our Zamin family from a Britisher! What Ma? ...is it not there? Yes Son, I've been looking for it since morning but its nowhere to be found "Hey Janaki, get here..." "I ask you to look after the house &What're you doing inside?" Come on, Son... "Look at her coming like a Diva..." No-one from outside has come inside... So... how could it have happened without your knowledge? Huh? Tell me! ...stands like a Mute-convict giving-away her guilt! "What' happened?" There he is! See the true colors of the Maid you've allowed into our home! This is why. ...we asked you not to let a strange-stray, into our home! Just tell me what happened..? Hey, go get your Uncle! Sure Ma... Hey wait up, you... & the other one along, too! I'm getting to the bottom of this, today! It has come to this, now! What' happened, now? "What's happened", you ask! Damn! Should it happen right before the festival? Could it be a bad-omen? "Our pistol for generations, is missing..." I say & you just stand there!? We'll get it back... Oh god... Goddess, please find it for me! I'm lamenting about my missing property... "...& she is least bothered!" "Then I'm sure its, Her!" No Madam, I did not take it... Did somebody else drop-in, dear? No stranger has to enter, brother... ...we have one inside, already! She must've taken it! Say... Do you have any money problems? Why'd you rob when you already have a dependent!? Speak... Why're you asking her, even? She won't speak a word of it! She'd answer only to the Police once they take her away to the Station! Brother-in-Law... Why would she have any need for it? -What could she do- -Honey... Just shut up! You know, nothing! I'm noticing you too... Ever since she got here... You don't treat her like any "Maid!" ...think I don't know? Just wait... You're finished! If the gun is missing, it'd surely be inside! ...just have to look for it! I've scanned & searched the whole place, already! "If it is inside, how can it be missing, still?" "You're unwell already..." "Why're you getting anxious? Let it go..." Hey, go and look for her son! Bring him out too... Hey... what're you doing there? Speak... Everyone out there is calling you, come! You're nicely caught today... You check inside... "What is taking you so long?" "Drag him out, I say!" He isn't coming, Ma! ...but he's upto something! Ma... ...found the pistol! No... He had stolen the pistol! Seeing his Mother get yelled at... See! Its found! He is returning it, now! Yes Mother, we saw him do just that! No... I didn't steal, but I found it... -See... -So... you found it?! It is no big deal for the one who stole it ...to also find it, yeah? After giving a place to stay & 3 meals a day... You dare to steal from me!? Now that the culprit is caught... "I didn't!" Lets phone the Police! "After a beating or two from them..." "They'll straighten up!" "Why're you blowing this, now? Uh?" "You please keep quiet!" "We'll handle this!" How can you too, say that- What're you...? Why did you slap him? Hey... ...you just, want the gun. Right? Here... Keep it for two days, play with it & return it back! "Uh! What nonsense is this?" "You saw what he just did, Brother?" "Not right, Brother-in-Law..." What have I done, so....? I know it all... "Where all do I have to look for you, dear?!" "You must be mad at your Mother!" Come on up, dear... Won't Mommy know, that you didn't steal it?! Before any of them could hit you... I slapped first, to stop them! Forgive me, dear... "Alright... welcome, Sir!" Don't you have electricity? "Well... it used to shock us if we touched Current," "But now, even touching the current-bill is shocking us!" So... I've switched it all, off! Couldn't climb the stairs uh?! You seem exhausted! Here, have some water! Sir, you a Detective...? You're right! Drink the water! Tell me, Sir! What's the case? I only have, one Daughter! & I'm getting old too... Any day could be my 'Last'! I agree... Before my time runs out... I wish to get her married! So, I've fixed a Groom for her... Is 'He' good or bad... You must find that out, about him! Definitely! "Photo..." Here you go...! "Okay..." You've come, trusting me! Climbing all these stairs, too! ....it was tough! "Worry not"! I shall hover like a hawk & get-back! "...his latest color photo!" Perfect. Now leave his name & address... Name is Kalyana Raman... Okay... Age, 27! Brindhavan Street, R.S. puram! Sagittarius sign! & his star... No-no, I don't need all that! I'm not going to be praying for him... ...that won't be necessary, this should do! I'll tell you, with these details! -Is that okay? -If you say so! Come back next week! Definitely, Sir! I'll get going, Sir! You'll manage or should I piggy-back you? Oh no Sir... No Sir, I'll manage! Alright, take it slow... Careful-Careful, Mind the knee! You'll make it next week, yeah? Sure Sir ...try Chericof syrup! To collect your monthly rent I'm forced to follow you... You have no shame nor any source... Calm down... & are hunting cases with a 'no-cost' coat! So... how many months am I due? Four months! Didn't I ask you not to yell!? ...its a lil' short! Get that, here! ...but wait, Sir! It's only two-months. Balance? In this condition, who'd give you a case? You repeat yourself, month on month! If you don't pay the rent on-time... "Doctor has already warned you..." I'll trash all your stuff! "Hello..." Tell me, Uncle... "Kannayiram!" "Your Mother isn't keeping well! Where are you, now...?" "I suggest you get here, soon!" Tell me, what happened? "Can you hear, its your Mom. She has fallen sick!" Hello, Uncle... Sir... Couple of those notes are counterfeit. Let me check! I shall handle that... -Sir, Sir... -Leave! I need to rush to my native. Mom has fallen sick! Get lost... "Asks for Hundred bucks, so casually..." Say Manickam... is the Son coming, even? Hasn't her Brother has confirmed This, is what she wanted! Pack her-up... Let's wait a lil' longer... I've informed him & he'll definitely be here...! "She kept praying for your return..." "...to the Gods, till yesterday!" "& directly from the Temple," "...she got home, thinking of you & lied down! "And in the morning, she never woke up!" Where is my Mother, Uncle? "Forgive me, Son!" "What have you done to her, Uncle?" Before I could get here what've you done to Mom, Uncle? I knew that you'll somehow make-it... to look at her, one last time, I tried my best... But these Scoundrels... stopped me from doing anything! She always wished to go to Holy-Kasi! ...so I had her sent, there! Couldn't do anything else, son! I know it was wrong of me to decide without asking you! "You may take my life, even!" "...finish this discussion soon!" Wait now... Finally...there he is! Conclude this council so we can move-on... We're paying the price for our Father'-fault... Patience, Son... we understand your anger! Your Dad' left Five acres of land, & a portion of this house, ...willed to his Mother & has disappeared! "Even if he was with us we could've questioned him" & now that isn't possible, too! You're his rightful-heirs... ...but are made to wait for a signature from someone like him! Fortunately your Mother isn't around to witness these! We have our customs & rituals specific for our village -"Oh yes... -Isn't it? -True! -He is right... Family-fortune is only for, Legal-heirs! Such, illegitimate-individuals can't claim a thing! We wouldn't let that happen... Isn't it fair? He fails to visit his dying Mother, But has arrived promptly for his 'Share'! You caught the point wise-man! Our Father, was a Mad-man... For willing a Share, for his Mother! But we don't approve it... Look here, Kannayiram... Until this house is sold, You must stay, settle all issues & only then, leave! That wraps it up... What's next, can we finalize on the date for the Temple-festival? Just point where I must sign, & I shall, promptly... What's more to discuss? All okay, right? Yeah!? Alright okay... Listen, this house will be auctioned in two-weeks Okay? Kannayiram... Our 'Military' mans caravan by the village border, ...is all cleaned-up! You may stay there! Why the rush to sell the house? That' our concern... We plan to settle in Kovai city! You better go & mind your business! -Here, keep this! -Take it... It's your brother, giving... Why the irritation? Choosing between Brandy & Whisky for the night! Why, what about you...? Thinking if this'd run just as before! "Hey.." ...is that Loser, leaving with that car? Why do you care, what he does? Just, mind your business! Go... So... what's a Detective? Had I known... I'd explain, gladly! "We should've driven him & his Mother on the same day, they arrived" "...but we couldn't, as we were just kids!" "& now, he can't get-away with anything!" "We brothers won't let it happen!" "Keep him informed..." "Who your Mother was? & as what she was, here...?" "Just try to understand. The entire village knows of it!" "Kannayiram..." "When did you return...?" Hi Sori Muthu bro! What's with your eye? Was it any insect? -Nah, its nothing -...apply castor-oil & you'll be fine! But wait... are you crying, Son? You're reminded of Mom? No, No bro. It's nothing... Okay then, I'll get going... Alright bro! Let me stay-back & see what happens! "This was your Mother' last-hope!" "Won't you visit your Mother?" "Won't you visit your Mother, dear? How many times should I explain, Ma?" "-What am I to come there & do, Ma? Fine dear..." "Mom shall pray for you, dear!" Hinduism, isn't just a Religion... It's a Science! On the right day, we'd decorate... & make offerings to Goddess Durga! Raise your hands & pray to her! Bless us, Baghavathy... Pray to her... Heard any news about, him? Got no-clue of where he's gone! ...left on the day, your Mom passed-away! "He seemed quite broken, that day!" ...made enquires on all sides! Anyway, are you comfortable here? Oh yeah... Get that house sold, soon! I'll sign the documents & leave... "...trying their best!" ...not finding Buyers! They'd soon locate your Father & get done with it soon, I guess! Fine, I'll get going... Where are you rushing to...? ...to the Village-Council, of corse! You'd just gape at them. Why change your gait, then? Here... Is this Buffalo'-Milk or Cow'-Milk? Not sure but keeps the business going! "Why won't they turn the T.V off!" "Stupid girl, why'd she do this?" Bro, excuse me! "Sir, what happened?" ...just wait, Son! "You can't just walk in..." -"Sir, I'm a Detective from Coimbatore -Hey, move-out!" -Hey 203! -"Yes Sir!" "What's the confusion, check?! Right away, Sir!" Hey, get the Mother, inside! "Madam, please get in!" "Ma..." Enough already... -Who're you...? -"Uncle..." "The Boy' Uncle..." "Where' her Husband?" "Works in Saudi, Sir!" "Saudi eh?" "Yes Sir!" "How long have they been married?" "Six months, Sir!" -Six months, eh? -"Yes Sir" "& already...?" "Yeah? What is this ma'am?" You! Turn that T.V. off, now! Sir, don't touch it... "Evidence!" "Evidence..." "...she did marry, whom she loved!" "I believed that she'd be happy!" "I had no clue that she was plotted, against" "Now on, I have no-one to call my own" Go-on. Thinks he is some James Bond! To file a Case or take me to Court... I got nobody... "Let bygones be bygones..." "...I've got nothing left" "Less-sugar, yeah?" -"Yup!" -"Okay, leave it..." Sir... Good morning, Sir! Sir, this morning... -Tea -at the 4th Street... House no. 7! Hey, why isn't the Tea hot? Sir, it was hot! -...you want it more? -Sir...! "Good Morning, Sir!" Sir, the hanging-case this morning. In 4th Street... Yes Suicide... Sir, it wasn't a Suicide! If you take a closer look... Edge of the noose, from where she was hanging... ...the knots were too-perfect! Why'd a girl who's about to hang herself, ...care to tie such perfect-knots? "Also... her night-gown was a lil' torn, too" So... someone must have tied her up & "You!" Good morning, Sir... Regarding the suicide case, this morning that girl was... If you observe closely, Sir... Why would she choose to hang-herself in the Hall? & with the T.V. running so loud? So this is not a Suicide, but a planned murder, Sir! Who're you? Tell me... "Private Detective Kannayiram, Sir!" Protecting the Public, ...is our duty, Sir! Such-matters don't suit you... And so... Sir... You cannot manhandle a Detective. Don't you know? You come into my Station... & dare to investigate in front of me? Sir, I feel he has a point- Listen to me, You... Someone sporting a coat may confuse you... Should I listen to all that!? Setting-up, this new Station out here, "...was not for these random cases" "Understand?" That was just a family-feud... & we cannot get involved! They'll handle it... Am I making sense? Absolutely, Sir! Their council will handle it! Case, closed. Thats it! "Hey... take a closer-look!" "Make it quick!" "KANNAYIRAM, your true friend!" "Wait till we get a hold of you!" "Agent Kannayiram!" "Agent Kannayiram, 2 Kms!" "Police Station: 5 Kms Agent Kannayiram: 2 Kms" "Kovai-folks..." "You needn't dodge your difficulties," "Nor hunt for what is lost!" "Whatever the case be, He'd shoulder it with a smile!" "However much you pay, He'd accept it happily!" "It's wrong to not introduce him, still..." "He' our brother..." "Kannayiram, K A N N A Y I R A M!" "He has a thousand-views!" "Who' this character in the Radio-Ad...?" That'd be my, Bro... It is I, who refers cases to him! "In all, Eighteen-districts:" "The only detective sporting a coat is, our Bro!" "Call him, now!" "98408-39004" "He'd skip his sleep, to serve you..." "& spoil the sleep of the, Baddies!" "Agent Kannayiram!" "Hey!" With that, 'Your Agent Kannayiram' Ad... Why're you hacking & putting me up for sale, in your channel? I plead you to, never play that crappy-ad! After listening to your Ad, Coat-rentals are calling me... & asking to settle-dues! Please understand... Whenever I ask you you may play it! "Who are you?"

Go now & return with a photo of your Cat! Greetings, Bro... ...heard you returned a week ago!? Caught your advertisement on radio too! It'd be so cool, if it came on T.V. Tell me why're you here...?

I'd like to capture you for a Documentary that I'm filming "It'd be great if I could interview you..."

'First-time', eh?! "Shall we start the Interview?" "Yeah, its a great opportunity for you. Go ahead" "So... why did you choose this profession?" You already seem very frail... I'm not sure how to tell you this! Why Son? But its great that you came to me! What're you talking about, Son?! The Boy you've fixed... is not of proper character! Uh-Oh... He sings love-longs in street-corners! & that girl too, was behaving very bad, in a public place! Here, a photo of their jolly-times! His character isn't right! Ditch him! But Son... This girl... is my daughter! Yes Son! I'm the People' Guardian! "But, they don't know that! Sir.." "Its... about your... Costume!" This is not merely a costume, but a 'feel' for my capability! "Its a nice costume, nice..." What kind of cases do you take up? "Psycho," "Sadist," "Serial-Killers!" "& also, Financial-Scam!" Like-so, cases which no-one can solve. I take those-up! "Excuse me..." "Couldn't find a photo of my Cat, Bro!" "But I could come-along..." "New-client?" Hey! Just wait... Aren't we going to find, just that? "What is this Kannayiram?"

Follow... "I'm sure this jobless-rider'll stop & try to small-talk, just watch!" -Who are you Ma'am? -"Hey..." Is she 'new' around here? You continue staring & she'd become 'Stale'! She is new... As far as this village is concerned... From birth to death it is all about customs & rituals They're strong-believers & also ...a Superstitious-lot! Oh yeah! "Something-Fishy..." I guess we're closing-in! Come on... Sister... "Whats the name of the fish?" "Sankara!" -& your Cat' name? -"Sheela" "Got it..." Cat is Sheela... & Fish is Sankara!

Come on, Come on! Keep it cool... I'll get Sheela out, without any trouble! Hai... just as expected Baby-Sheela, has been found! But in our search for this lil' cat...

Whatever is troubling you we can strike & smash it away! Are you wanting a Bail? Stop crying & speak-up, Sir! Was it a theft, case? ...No! Who is Divya, Sir? My Daughter! "What happened, Sir?" She tuitions children who can't afford Schooling ...buys them books, too! She did everything she could! She left to Erode for some work on this 12th! That night... She called me at 10 p.m. She sounded tense... "Why are you tensed, dear?" "Tell me what is it!" I asked "That man is following me..." "I'm very scared, Dad!" she said "And that man..." "What is that man doing?" I asked "Dad-Daddy..." She called frantically to say something But the line got cut! I called back immediately... but couldn't reach her! I didn't know what to do... I was going mad... Quickly, I took a friend along and... went to complain at the Police Station near Erode! & the Inspector there, said: "We have an unidentified body!" "Is that, your Daughter?" He asked! Still... I proceeded with a heavy-heart! Divya... Divya! It was my daughter Divya, Sir! And that Inspector tells me... that, "she' committed suicide after a love-failure" I couldn't understand... The nail-marks on her body... The hand that'd slapped her... was impressed on her face! Seeing all that... I told the Inspector... "Sir... She spoke to me on phone!" And gave him all the details... But He never took anything seriously! There were nail-marks on her body! & impression of the palm, that'd slapped her! It wasn't a suicide... I swear, it wasn't a Suicide... My lil' girl was raped and killed! This time, He' let you off! Hey... "From the same number she'd received 5-6 calls!" "Nine...Seven..." "One...Zero..." "Two...Two...Nine..." "Four...Five...Six..." "I want, Justice!" "They must've done something!" "No-one must experience, my plight!" "Divya..." "And for asking Justice..." "I too am falsely-accused & jailed!" "Tomorrow morning..." "...they plan to shift me to the Sub-Jail!" He was crying all-night It was a pitiful sight... No Father must ever be in his situation... They've raped & killed her! There' no-one to question them, even! I don't understand why the Police are trying to cover this case! The only clue with us right now is... The number Kumarappan ga- "No-one must experience my plight!" "Hey..." ...you'll do as asked, correctly? Definitely, bro! Hey... This must be stuck all over the village! Surely bro... Consider it done, bro! "When someone we love, dies" "We'd long to see their face, one last-time!" "You've made me look at my girl in such a state. Why Oh-God!" This is how it must be stuck Okay...? It must be at the right height & distance, for visibility! "My plight... nobody should-" "Won't I find Justice?" "As per registration..." Its registered in the name of "Maran!" So.. ...with this information we must move step-by-step "No. 4, Andhamadam street..." "Selvapuram" "Kannayiram..." "...Kannayiram!" "Why've you grown such a big mustache?" You were handsome, without it... Why, you also looked better without wrinkles. What to do now? In our Eastern Corner-Temple... The Deity's-blade has been burgled! Look for it, Son! I'm working on such an important case & you ask about: Deity'-blade & Dinner-plate! I'll get going, then... Keep going... I was asked to inform you, Son! I'm not taking-up cases for free, like before... Who is it...? Open-up, its your well-wisher! "Casting a Vote is, your Right!" "Not doing so is, our Plight!" "Illegal votes are, a Fright!" "Stopping it is, your Might!" Cast the right vote & be in peace for, five years! Cast an illegal-vote & you'll be jailed! Stop your silly-sermon... Which Party are you from? What is your Logo? How much are you paying for each Vote!? State that first & we can discuss the rest! You dare to demand a bribe from a Government official? I'm here to verify the Voter's List...

(Could've chosen a better mustache!) Please don't mind it, Sir! How many of you reside, here? -Just me & my Husband -& your name? I'm Chinna Paapa, Sir? & your Husband? He' Periya Muthu... "Periya Muthu!" 'Maaran' from upstairs... Is he your son? No-No... He isn't my son! Besides, we don't have any kids yet! In the near-future, maybe... He is renting the place, Sir! I keep him only because He pays rent, promptly! Very shrewd, though! Where does Mr.Shrewd work? Oh I have, no clue... ...but a bunch of guys do come, looking for him! & they do seem like a Team... I had come on the 18th! But this was locked... Where had you gone? ...to the Cinemas, Sir -and went to a Hotel too! Maaran wasn't home too... Where had he gone? Oh is it...? Uhm... it was a Thursday, He came & left, in a hurry... Saying, He was off to Erode & left the keys with me! But why're you asking me about him, Sir? Periya Muthu & Chinna Paapa must vote, without fail! Only then you'd conceive! Say, Kannayiram... "I've heard... Although you missed to mention!" You've gone to forbidden places, already! "What're you talking about, Chief? I don't understand..." You don't know...? "A dead body was found near the Railway-track..." -"Is it?" -And like a clown... Putting on his Coat & Cap... He' gone close to that body for 'examining'... "At that moment, the Police have arrived..." They cuffed-him right-there... Took him to the Station and... Kept him all-night & bashed him up! "Instead of wasting time on useless -issues, atleast from now on..." Go & look for a regular-duty! I shall go & look for a good-duty... Haven't you gone for your 'Sneaky-duty'? What' he mentioning about, Chief? "Oh, its nothing!" You must make it to the carnival Tomorrow-night! ...for all kinds of footage! Sure... "What type of get-up is this, Kannayiram?" A Disguise... "Really?" "Nice..." "Let's hope they don't find you!" "Somehow we must follow, Maaran..." "...and we're solving this case!" "Tomorrow there is a festival, you know?!" How was the Temple sweet? "Surely, I'll go..." Breakfast, done? Greetings, Bro! Its the blade, the old-lady mentioned! But why is it, here!? "There were 2 guys standing here!" "They must've left it!" "Don't know where they went..." This is the Thousand year old Temple I spoke of! The Offerings here are tasty too... "Oh boy..." You found it already...! "My dear..." "Priest..." "Come & take a look..." "The Deity' blade, has been restored!" Try this book on the various-varieties of dung-flattening! Seem to be in a hurry... Yes Lady...

Within one hour, I'll get him. "Watch it..." "Who' this Guy?" I don't know... Seems to be new... Got the case-documents, yeah? How much should I pay the Police? 4000 Rs.

"Get it done, with this... No-way, leave me alone!" "Try to understand..." "You know why I ask, right?" "You're getting me into trouble" Hey, get-lost! Pissing in proximity... "The one accompanying Maaran is Dileep" "He' also living in the same street" "Dileep...?" "Hey... it's that same cover!" "I noticed another man handing over the same cover to Dileep" Sure its the same cover? Yes, the same cover! "Your eyesight is excellent in the dark, even!" Even with these binoculars, I can't see! "You're a fabulous Assistant You work for me!" Observe & report on what they're discussing! -"What happened?!" -"Hey..." "...something' going on!" "They're moving, again!" "How far're they going? I'm low on petrol, too!" "What happened?" -I just told you... -Hey!? They've gone, already... Ask them them to wait... Step-down, First! It' totally dried-up! Are you a real Agent, even?! Be it an Agent or President, a bike can't run without Petrol!" "Dileep, was giving a number to someone yesterday" I made a note of it... I followed him into a building... ...there, He handed over this cover to someone! In this murder, "Dileep' supposed to be involved!" "Its getting late..." "W-What...?" "Divya...?" Who? Who're you...? Isn't your Dad, Kumarappan in jail? Uh? ...after you were raped & kill- "Whom are you talking to, dear?" "Dad..." "I promise, it was your Dad in the Jail!" Is 'He', your Father? Then who was, "He"? What is this, Son? What're you talking? Dear, your name is Divya, Right? Weren't you raped and your Father jailed?! He is out of his mind...! Get lost, right now... Just be gone! Kannayiram...? I just want to talk with them! Go away... What happened? What' the problem, Sir!? Let me... "Okay, Sir" "Sorry... Please" Take him away, before he gets beaten-up! What're you doing, Kannayiram? "Seems like a nut-case..." Its Divya...! Why're you behaving like this, Kannayiram? -"Divya..." -Uh? & She' alive, Athirai...! -"Divya? Are you sure? -Yes!" That is the girl, I saw in the photo... Mr. Kumarappan' daughter! You merely had a glimpse at the photo & how're you sure it is 'Her'!? "Who' sent you...? Mr. Muttaiah, Right?" Yes Sir... Sir, we're here to meet a prisoner, Kumarappan I was told about: Shifting him to Sub-Jail on the 26th! Am I not checking? Hold on! Sure... Please relax... "There was no Kumarappan, transferred!" From the Sulur Station they'd brought him here I've checked & there' no such Entry made, in three-days! Now leave... Go-on... "Coming-in at odd-times!" Think real hard... "Hey Ekaambaram, Tea!?" It's too much confusion, for me! Hey! Sleep now or you had it! Oh, that hurts... Please let me go, Sir...! "that hurts, Sir..." -That hurt' Sir... -"Sir!" -Sir, I'd like some information -What now...? "That night in the cell...on Saturday" What' with him? He' pissed himself, already! Clean it up... I'll wash it myself, Sir! Kumarappan case, Sir! What is it, Mister? Regarding the 'Night-Rounds' eh? Sir, need an information... Hey, this is my Station. Don't raise your voice? It is you who's screaming. Why'd I scream, Sir? "Let's hear him out, Sir..." Speak... Sir, Mr. Kumarappan who was inside the cell that night... He was being transferred to Sub-Jail the next-day! Which Kumarappan? There' no-one by that name... "Sir..." Sir... -that night... He was with me, in that Cell! Sir, he was also dressed in white! -Was lamenting about his daughter -Not that I know of... Get-lost... "Kannayiram..." Why're you rubbing his wrong-side? Do not get caught in this... Sir... I've visited & checked in the Sub-Jail too ...there is no, Kumarappan! So... where did he go from here, that night? Please check & tell us, Sir! He'd came-in that night? Sure...? Subbayya, was On-duty, that night! We don't have any such registrations. Anyways, why're you asking? "In a Police Station near Erode, I'd lodged a complaint" Sir... Sir, Mr. Kumarappan had come... to complain about his missing Daughter. You had, even- ...showed him a girl's-body, that was recovered! Sir, it was on the night of 19th... That's right... We found a dead-body by the Railway-track! But, that was a Male... "A Male?" Yup! Even last week, someone else enquired about the same body! "But you're giving too much details & that was an unidentified corpse, Son! "Dance, Dance... You Dance!" "Come on... No-No, I can't dance..." "Sorry Ma'am!" Look-out. Sorry... "Hey clear this area-now! Clear-Up..." Move aside, people... Kindly listen... Don't stand here... Everybody, move! All devotees, please step back... You did this too? -Uh? Sir, I just got here...! Hey... -Hey, come on... -Sir! Sir, why're you dragging me? Sir... Kannayiram...!? I haven't done anything, Sir! "Then why were you following him?" "I followed him, for a Case, Sir!" You, get him inside & lock him to the jeep... "Oh my..." How to do this, Bro...? Start with placing your head on the ground! Next lift your legs, straight-up! & then tighten your stomach, fully! Surely! Start now. Lets see you do it! I'm on it, Bro! Hope you don't have Hernia-problem! Not at all, bro! Fine then, get-started... Hey, slowly, slowly! Kannayiram... "What's the benefit of doing this, bro?" How about "Bail"! "Nowadays, people do anything only if they get something in-return!" "Kannayiram...?" What're you doing!? "The Inspector..." "...declared that I can't solve a thing Even if I stand on my head!" "So... I'm simply testing!" Hey... ...you're inside the Jail! & that too, for a murder-case! What else can I do? What do you mean? "You could've quoted what Kumarappan said, yeah? On that day... I've followed Maran everywhere! To all places, ...from a Car Mechanic-Shed to Hospital, Bank & his House! There is a high-chance for my face being recorded in the Bank' CCTV! The Police who purchased the book on Kama-Sutra has seen me... & Finally, even before he fell dead... I was following him closely in the Temple-festival too! How can I go to the Police, now... & say: "Oh no-no... I got nothing to do with him, Sir" "I don't know who this Maaran is! I'm innocent, Sir" ...if I say something like that would they spare me? Moreover, you know about this Inspector! ...only procedure known to his block-head is feasting on Biriyani! What' puzzling me is: "Who'd have killed Maaran?" "I'm probably the prime-suspect in Maaran' murder-investigation!" "If Maaran & Dileep together murdered Divya..." Call-up Dileep...! I've been trying his phone but its switched-off! "That's it..." That day, it looked like Maaran & Dileep were having an argument... So, Dileep must be connected to Maaran' murder! Huh? Whatever it be... It is you, who' stuck in this problem! Murder-weapon has your finger-prints! What...? My finger-prints...? In an attempt to help a Stranger... ...you're strongly-locked in the case! "If Agent Kannayiram..." "...takes up this case," "In the fear of getting caught..." "What if... they killed Maaran," "only to trap, Me?" Stop thinking so hard, Kannayiram! To be trapped & stopped You're not 'Sherlock Holmes'! Sherlock Holmes, is fictional! This Agent Kannayiram, is real! Only now, this case is heating-up! I won't rest until this is solved! Alright, tell me... What do I do now? -Brother... -Number- Brother... "I've done it...!" I did it, bro... No. 1 All the places, Maaran visited... must be re-visited for enquiry! No. 2 Must find-out about the Lousily-Lamenting prisoner, Kumarappan, is? No. 3 To find all this out I must get out of here! For that I need a bail... And only you can get it for me! I've already spoken with a Lawyer... Sir... My Husband hasn't returned home after last night's festival! His phone is 'Not-reachable' too! "Which area?" "Annamedu Street" "And his name?" "Dileep!" "He is Dileep!" "Any problem between you two?" He never used to talk to me, properly... But now, He isn't coming home either! "He has gone missing, completely!" "Does he consume Alcohol?" Sure, Sir! & I'd take a beating too... Its okay, dear! Don't cry now... Go on... Ma'am... "Dileep!" you say...? Is he Maaran' friends? "Hey Kannayiram"? You're locked-up, already... & you want to enquire, still? You write, submit & leave, Dear... Sir, please check with her... Some men get drunk just to beat-up their wives! "Got any photo?" "Yup, I got it at home..." Okay Sir, I'll get him! "You've got interim-bail for 7 days!" "I'll keep you informed!" You must prove you are innocent, within a week! Understood? If not you'll be put back inside... Your voluntary involvement in this case... Tell him, Sir! ...is only going to land you in troubles, I feel! And I can't do anything beyond this! Only in the festival-crowd from her video... Maaran is clearly-seen getting dragged by 4 guys! "It is only with that as evidence we managed to get your bail!" Maaran was dragged by 4 guys, eh? Yup! For the next 7 days, do not interfere in anything... "Just as Sir suggested, try to save yourself..." "Understand...?" What' that...? Want me to remove my shades? Yup, give it... "No..." No-one touches my Shades! "Those henchmen are almost tailing me!" "Damn!" "I missed nabbing those Culprits..." You see that? Who're these guys? Athirai... Earlier, a similar hand-bag, ...was seen with Maaran too, yeah? I suspect that bag holds some clues... Just enquire about that bag! I have some office-work, I'll try! Adjust the mirror, a bit! Okay? Uhm okay...! What, Why're we stopping? "One second" Sir, Sir... ...why're you blocking? Why're you straining & shadowing me? He is quite a, famous Director! -Is it....? -Yup! Welcome... So.. what'll the 'Director' drink? Just Alcohol... And some curry for side-dish! Good joke... -Brother... -Yes... Why were you following me? I wasn't 'following'! I was just scouting locations for Mammootty & Manju Warrier! "Why is he opening the drawer?" "...maybe Money?" What' with the Toy-gun? I've seen massive Tankers! This is a dummy... Cinematic Guns... But have you've seen this? "Token Chundi!" It' unused for 30 years! (How old are you, then?) Recently... I had it oiled & ready! "Would he know to shoot, even?" ...but you can't, without a bullet! I've another... "Oops, I laughed too soon!" Greetings bro... I'm Maayavi... I'm a popular Detective, in my native... In my dreams, at-least! So... you don't know to cook. What else do you know? "Kung-Fu" Karate... I'm familiar with it, all! If only you decide, I could become a Detective, even! -Is it? -Of corse... I wished to join as your Assistant... ...which is why I tried tailing you without your knowledge! So without you knowing... I followed Maaran, to help you! "So I sneaked into his house when he wasn't around" "But you went away, with this girl!" (Lets enter, auspiciously) (Biscuit...) ("Oh god..") ("Hope I get something!") ("You hair is your beauty!") ("It is also your bane!") "& handled a trouble too"! Greetings, Madam... Greetings... How re you madam? What do you want? Where are you coming from?! -I'm your Son, Ma... -My Son?! That is how I feel, it is recommended to eat Parle-G biscuits for tooth ache! Want one? Get going, Lady... "I even went to the Medical shop, he visited" Bro... The man who came here with a shoulder bag... What did he get? "He got blasting's from the Doctor..." & who're you? You resemble an Animated-monkey from Amazon forests? Hey buddy, "Deluxe..."? Didn't you go to Dubai, to become a Male-Nurse? You were so proud about poking needles onto the Foreigners!? Yup, I got bored of all the poking.... The room they provided was more like a coffin! But I came back saying my body belongs here! So... when're you dying? Hey... Just wait one day I'll catch you by surprise! So... what do you want? You'll die in 3 days uh? Head directly to the Graveyard Why come to a Medical shop? By the way, what're you doing, buddy? I'm part of an undercover operation! What? Your Under's are operated? Careful.

The Doc didn't know & sent him away! -That illiterate! -"Deluxe..." "Where is the Ethanol?" Who is that buddy? I can see his bones even without an X-ray! Keeps claiming that He' a Doctor! You go-on, I shall manage!!! I have discovered this much, for you Bro! Stop it. I can understand... Everyone in the village suspects you for Maaran' murder! & only now I can see that you're innocent! How's that? Well, the Police've clearly stated: "He was hacked by a long-knife!" And you're only carrying a Pistol, How could you've done it? "Brilliant!" I'd dropped a 5 Rs. coin inside the car... Try, finding it... Give me five minutes! (Is this a Seat or Shaving-slab?) Woah! this is going to hurt! Hey... ...you running-away with the car' engine? Wow... it even has an Engine? No, I've only got Chicken-bones in there! Hello... -"Athirai!" -Tell me, Sir (A coin is very challenging Lets ask for a clue...) Excuse-me Bro... Could you give me any clue...? A clue!

I'm just covering-him, past 4 days! Its of no benefit to me, absolutely! That's it, Sir! Anyway, how do you know Maaran? Well, Maaran... Maaran came to enquire about the dead-bodies found in Sulur & they'd also pile-up the abandoned-bodies from around & bring them in! He'd ask for their post-mortem reports... "Even when, Family is around we act lethargic...." "But the ones he checks about, are all unclaimed bodies. So..." "I guessed back-then, even..." "that, it could land us in, trouble!" "& now you've come, looking for him!" "Tread carefully, Sir!" Hello! "Kannayiram, where are you?" "...found Maaran' bag!" "Return to the caravan, right-away!" Hey... its the same cover which Dileep gave Maaran! "Why is Maaran' bag full of Corpse'-photos & details?" "What are Dileep & Maaran doing, actually?" "All are from different cities!"

Why're you fearing someone like him? I'm out on-bail & even I won't fear him! "Try & trace the Sulur dead-body' fingerprints!" Please talk to him, Sir! Watch this! What's with the pride in your walk? Sir, try listening to what he has to say! So... you got it? Oh I got it, alright! "I go looking for the ones who're killing..." "& I get to see them, only as dead bodies" "But I couldn't see my Mom, in that state, even!" Before I got there my Uncle had her sent away... "What?" But why...? Uncle would explain: "My mom wished for it & he had to see it done!" They make-up all kinds of stories! Ask and he'd say it is: Custom or Ritual! I still can't believe my Mom is no more... ...but I can still feel her presence around me! How could one sleep with such thoughts running!? Whenever "Mom called to meet me..." "My anger wouldn't allow me!" Had I been with her, whenever she called out... "She might not be dead!" Guess it's my anger, that killed her! "Its not your fault!" "Don't think that way..." "Everything will be alright..." "I can understand your feelings!" I'm leaving to document, Ms. Anna Marie.... "You can join..." "We know that you cremate the unidentified-bodies..." ...and also perform the last-rites! ...could you tell us, why you do it?! Not just, 'Living' all-alone... ...dying all-alone is dreadful, too! The dead, find a kind of Peace! And for me too... Night or Day, doesn't matter... Even the Policemen... insist that I must come... So, I wouldn't care even if it is midnight! With what I've got at hand, I perform the rituals that I'm aware of! ...and rest them For me, Not just when Living, But even when Dying No-one must die, all-alone too! Consciously I'd never abandon anyone... "But those who die alone..." "...don't find peace & keep roaming around us!" "Won't you come to meet your Mother?" Hey... Maayaavi...? Prepare some Toddy... Whom are you attacking, at this hour? I'm in no mood to be laughing...! Pardon me, Bro... You have your share of sorrow, too! Here, hold the drink! Down it till your neck! "Ma..." "Mother!" "There was a Maid..." "Janaki!" Would she sing well, too!? "She'd make great desserts!" "& top it with almonds & cashews" "Prepare it with care and serve it to the Landlord!" "Come here..." "Inside, Dessert is getting ready..." Dessert eh...? No-wonder, you are sent out, on time! Start cleaning... We can have it, afterwards. Alright! "Who's that, along with the Kids?" The maid, Sir! She'd take care of the Zamin now on"! "Sit & watch, dear..." "This is our Home, they're all your brothers!" "They won't have a problem. Go on!" What is happening, bro? Hey, watch the movie quietly! Kids are done with the food Please come... "The kids..." "...must not feel their Mother' absence" "Should you even tell me that?" "Shouldn't quarrel with brothers, dear!" They don't have their Mom, even... Shouldn't we look out for them? She even had him live under the same roof! When that boy shared his observation after thinking it through... "Its no big deal for the one who stole it to find it too...!" Say... "Should one be qualified to even listen to what we say?" I don't think so, just the ears should do! I was speaking the truth, right? "After that night, nobody asked me to stay back" "...nor ask me to leave too!" After a point, I decided I don't need it & separated! Don't feel for it now, bro! In my home also, the rice would have lots of dust! & eat it, without making any fuss! Thanks a lot... ...you've made me forget all my worries! I'm very happy now! Was my joke really funny? No-No, I meant the comedy you just did! With this same eyes? Oh the same eyes, Okay wait. I shall remove all jinx! Does it hurt? No-No, its comforting! "Forgive me, dear!" "At that time, my heart couldn't accept her apology!" "My Mother was not, to my liking..." I then accepted her being: "...the way, He wanted her to be!" "Say Manickam... is the Son coming, even?" "Even her Brother is confirming this is what she wanted!" "Pack her-up!" Why're you waiting, still...? We've got places to be! I was told, her Son would join... Can't wait all day! "Correct!" No-one knows where the Landlord vanished or what happened to him! Not sure if He is dead or alive, even? Did the boy wait till the Landlord came over, Bro? Can't you understand who that boy, was? Sounds important, let me get closer... Who is it, Bro? Stop brushing your bottom... It may just tear! ...that is why I've placed a sack right-here! A sack! I'm sure you have a sack for everything! That boy also had a working-assistant! Can you guess who that was, at-least? What a mad-fellow! Can you guess why I like you a lot? Why Bro...? You're very loyal... "They stood around her dead-body & were cursing..." "They must've been building it up, for all these days!" "And so, I had her sent away, as she wished!" "Divya..." "Divya..." "...heard she moved near Tiruppur!" "Brindha..." "No-one came looking for that girl!" "And it was I who buried her!" "After the post-mortem was complete He never showed-up for her body..." "The address he'd submitted was fake too!" It didn't strike me, then... but I understand, now... Brindha isn't dead, yet! -"not dead?" -"Nope!" But, we did see Brindha' dead-body... Her Father too was sobbing, so hard! That's right... "Sobbed severely..." Even before looking at her body he was crying & running to it... No complaint was filed for the the bodies around the railway-tracks Except for Bindha'... So they'd set-up a random dead-body... & had us convinced... & diverted us! Check if you can find her address with this phone number, Sir! Have instructed, already... Bro... why did you ask for photos of the dead to be stuck it on the wall? Just to frame them all & to perform the 16th day ritual! Do what you're told, quickly! "Okay..." Here? Can't you attend the class on correct-time? I do... ...the dead-body I'd seen in Sulur, was 'unidentified' The one from Erode was, unidentified too! On the 18th, Maaran must have also gone to Erode for the same reason too! So, putting it all together... In the last Four months, Total number of 'unidentified' dead-bodies found in our state is: Fifty-Four! And the photos of Thirty-four, are in here... "All the dead-bodies in this paper-clipping" "...were found in the surroundings of a railway-track" He'd come & check on the Goods-Trains timings! On that day, he'd lost his purse too... So he was looking for his lost wallet! Yes Sir... So... what exactly are you doing? I apply grease in certain areas, Sir! & shall also tighten these bolts & nuts! -So the Southern Railways is running because of this lil' bucket!? -Fine, you continue applying! ...of which, Ten were Train accidents Three were Murder-cases, "...remaining Twenty-one bodies were:" "Natural-Death!" So all these dead-bodies were in, "Ettimadai..." -"...to:" -"Bro, use a hyphen!" Thanks, pal... You're well-trained, already! "...Dharmapuri" "...found in these Track-lines!" Observe there... ...all these dead-bodies were found at specific intervals, too! Hence, these Twenty-one dead-bodies, ...must somehow be connected! How're you this confident, they're connected? Post-mortem reports of all these dead-bodies Claim they're: Natural-Deaths! Why should bodies with 'Natural-Death' be found, by the railway-track? "This cannot be a coincidence!" It must all be a single-case! How do you claim they're all a single-case, Kannayiram? What if it is a Coincidence? "No... Athirai" "You know, Maaran..." We were both digging into his bag, yeah?! Remember, what he had...? He too collected details of these bodies, right! He must've done his research with that in hand! ...which is why they must've killed him! "Assuming that it was me, helping Maaran with this case" They'd sent this 'Kumarappan' character, ...& had me follow, Maaran & had me caught in confusion... As Dileep was aware of this case they killed him too! "There are no roads in the railway routes where these dead-bodies were found!" So, definitely they could not have dropped the bodies from some other channel! "So, only from a moving train, these bodies could've been thrown outside" But how is that possible, Bro? "They won't let one take a piss, even!" "& you're talking about throwing-away corpses!" Sure it can. What if it is not a passenger train...but a Goods train? Yes, it is absolutely possible! No, it can't be done, even then! Definitely it can't be thrown in the day time! It'd become a Public-issue! So, it must've been thrown in the Nights! How exactly do you open these doors? Sir, but who're you, Sir? I'm Pvt. Detective Kannayiram! I'm just asking for my knowledge! So, through any one of the Good-Train that passes in the nights ...they must've disposed every dead-body! Can this be opened when the train is running? I shall buy you some Alcohol Please tell me! The goods-train in this route, Starts from Palakkad, late in the night... Bodies must've been loaded in this train, because: From Paalakaad to Vaalayaar, is inside Kerala... No bodies with 'Natural-death' were found Crossing the State border, they've thrown bodies inside Tamil Nadu & also in different districts, ...which have different jurisdictions! So... getting caught with the Police, ...is highly unlikely! nor would anyone come to claim. None were claimed! Sir, have you ever noticed a dead-body by the railway track? Oh yes, it would be lying here & there ...we would simply ignore! "Good Citizen"! They've planned carefully! Say, are you following...? ...sort of! The Police too wouldn't mind beyond their Station-limit! "Guessing I would deduce it all," ...they'd also tried killing me! Somehow, I'd mistaken this was the work of that Inspector! But like I had presumed, ...this isn't any Children' game! There must be a big-gang behind all this! Those Master-minds, ...have planned well, to trap me in this case But no... Intending to trap me, they've handed a much bigger-case to me! ...the kind of case I was looking for, all along! Okay, Bro... Mr. Sub-Inspector, Please... Athira... "Come on!" "Case started..." ...shouldn't we inform the Police department? But why? Aren't you next to a Police, already? "Shaming him with 'mufti', eh?" Athirai... This case has come to me! I shall solve this, myself... "Listen..." You're not 'Sherlock Holmes' from London... You are Kannayiram, ...from Irumbathoor! "Keep that in mind, okay? Shame-Shame..." Listen up, 'Spoken-English-Class' ...there' no need to be Showing-off! We don't know of any Sherlock! Your house is here, get-going Galileo claimed: 'Our world is a sphere' ...and he was pelted to death! But the same spherical world, ...is celebrating him today! ...that was another-Level, Bro! How do you come-up with such-stuff, Bro? That too, with all those mosquito bites inside that caravan! Sir, where is the nearest Railway-Station? Valaiyaar is in 2kms! Then, that is where we must go! Hello Sir... Sir, weekly once in the night time ...from Palakkad to Chennai a goods train is scheduled. Yeah? We need an information, about this train! Everyday night 2 o clock. "From Palakkad" to Chennai, a Goods Train' is scheduled, yeah?" Yes... It reaches by early morning 02:00 hrs & leave by 02:45! Tonight as well? It doesn't stop in the platform here, but stops for the one before the station in Track2. But why, Sir? Sir, between 02:00 to 02:45a.m, 4Express trains would cross in this station! "It is at that time when the signal turns red for the Goods trains, so these trains could pass!" Two to Two fourty-five! That's when they're loading the dead bodies! "Dead body?" "Thank You, Sir!" Thanks a lot, man! What's he saying? "So what I'm saying is..." I don't think I introduced myself, I'll be back! Hi Sir, I'm private Detective Kannayiram! Inspection, Deduction, Murder, Theft, All-ready, Sir! 24 hours service, Sir! "9840839004! Thank You, Sir!" "Here' our next song to cheer you up!" "The Crime group & Hospital must be connected!" Why did you interrupt me!? "...must contact Brindha, somehow..." This is Maaran' voice! Bro... I had followed Maaran, yeah? I told you about it, too! When you were interviewing me! I did tell you back then too... According to my intuition, I felt what I needed won't be needed by Maaran. So I kept it safe! Rewind it... Now we must go to Maaran' house again? Rewind the cassette! Uhm... Bro?! I was just kidding, Bro... Bro, Why're you getting- Has it stopped, for real? Bro... help! You're yapping all-night... Can't you open a door, even? Down... Must be from pre-independence times Don't ask me? Get here... I'd asked you to fill the radiator. Did you? Of corse I did. Fully... How come the car has stopped? ...not for your Car. Bro I filled for my bike! Does your Bike have a radiator!? "Okay, go now & get some water!" "& some food, as well!" You got any money on you? But why? We have a Policeman with us Who'd dare to ask! -You relax, Bro. Sir, please come -Hey... In all my service, I've never taken a bribe! How could you, with those shivering-hands?" Hey, hey... lets go... -Come... Come now... -Stop! The van is going to Karamadai... -Its over, yeah? -Yup! "When is the next drop?" -"Got two more days, for that -Fine..." "Somehow you've turned up, just now!" But Sir, I saw them right here! You can't be serious...? The bodies were lying, right-here! I fell here, from up there! The bodies were all piled-up here! What you're saying & what we find here is just not... It was right here... Just in here... What the- I, I saw the dead-bodies Someone must've come in...Check this Sir, a burning cigarette! How could it've come here, otherwise? Someone must've just lit this, Sir! And they've moved the bodies, just now... -If I'm wrong, then how did this--Kannayiram...? You brought us saying it was 'urgent' Now we're here & you claim: "dead-bodies being piled-up!" ...but there is no real-evidence! What's happening to you...? You were always the 'Alert-One!'... Evidence! Let me secure this... He might blast me too! But, I must share my discovery! Bro, check it out... Someone' just taken a piss... It is quite-warm too... Should I take a sample? Go, get the car... The Station Master confirmed that the train runs only on Fridays! Start the car, we'll go to Valayaru & capture them all! (Let me just get-in quickly...) How did you race me to it, Bro? I came to enquire! There' a stage-play near-by Shall we check it out!? Not a chance! It' supposed to be, superb! Yup. I've enquired already... It is great, it seems... My eyes are burning from lack of sleep, already. Just come! "Today... we'll witness the life of a Honest-King!" "Which God features in that story?" "Viswamitrar!" His act of mischief, "& the balancing-act of King Harichandra..." "That is what we're here to witness!" A lie? Who dares to lie, under my rule...? This very instant, he must be slayed! Drag him to this dais, So I make him regret his action! "Where is he?!" Has he gone underground? I'd never hide... Nor can anyone hide, from me! I'm the one with..., "a Thousand views!" "Who're you, now?" Who are you? I'm an innocent-citizen! Stop yapping... I'm the innocent-lad who believed in a cleverly-constructed lie... "Falling for his fake-cries about losing his Daughter!" And about, "...roaming the streets for her!" I'm a respected Stage-Star, ...and you're ill-treating me! No, No, please don't! You won't open-up, otherwise... Oh no... I'll tell! I'm a Duplicate, Sir... But that's original. Speak the truth! Who watches a Stage-play, nowadays? Tell me... So... to make a quick-buck I became a ward-boy, in a Hospital! Roll fast, before he passes-away! I'd drink whenever I was stressed Though I worked as a Ward-boy, I didn't like that role! Suddenly one fine-day, I got a call I was penniless at that time... We're called because they like our work at the Hospital,mind you! As I wasn't doing what I loved, I decided to play whatever-part & didn't think of anything! The location was almost like a go-down! I was accompanied by a couple of friends! And on their behalf, 2 more had come! - Go-on... - Stop-pushing! Hurry-up! We never imagined, they'd hand-over that many corpses! All those bodies were covered in White-cloth! Go-Go-Go... Load it up & get-on, fast! Let's go You just a Driver or do you handle more? I'm only a Driver, Sir Jeweler Narayanan who pelts every Stray, "and Kothandam, a fan of mine..." "with whom I went-along, jollily!" "On a rock-road to the mountain-top" "We found an abandoned-area..." "We piled all the bodies & burned them upl" Wait, what? you burnt them all? -Do you take Alcohol? -No-no! Cigarettes? Nothing? "Nope..." Bless you with Health & Wealth! "Our vehicle would be stocked with corpses!" & as we kept burning them our pockets were filling-up! In the smell of fresh-notes we didn't notice the stench of dead-bodies Bro, someone's coming! "For the few days I had some money," "I drank & partied-hard!" "Who were the deceased?" "Who's paying to cremate them?" I knew nothing! "I used to be so drunk!" "Like a King!" But after 2 weeks... ...they called, again! This time, it was to a different-spot! Hey, get-up... its getting late! "Come-on... Come!" We loaded the bodies from the go-down to our vehicle! "Push..." But this time, we didn't burn them! What then? "We halted next to Walayar Station!" "And onto another vehicle..." "...we loaded the bodies!" "& we complied!" "There were 4 fresh faces from their side!" "They kept shifting the go-down, frequently!" "Only then we learnt..." "....they weren't fearing the Police" "But someone else!" "Soon, it became a practice!" "Where did the bodies come from? Come on. Speak up! I don't know... I swear! How dare you call it a 'Practice!' I swear, I don't know! Even when I used to work at the Hospital... From the Mortuary... I'd be asked to exchange unclaimed-bodies! "And I did, without any questions!" But these people... Were killing and getting the bodies? "Or extracting organs from these bodies? I knew nothing!" "In the meantime..." "They spoke of you to me," and asked me to lie to you! Fearing them, I did! "I stole a girl's photo from the Hospital admissions" "Posing as an innocent Father," "I entered the same-cell!" Only then I knew... You were the one, they feared! As things went on, One-day they phoned me... & informed they don't need me anymore! 'But why?' I asked... "You were late for a couple of days!" "You lack punctuality!" they explained "Where can I buy it from?" I asked "They cursed & hung-up!" Do you have their phone number? Nope... It was a different number, each time! Fearing them... I stopped carrying a phone Bro! Bro... We've got our clue. Lets move... Going by his words... Bodies must've come from the deceased' home! Still, they'd only send it to a graveyard! Why give it to someone-else? "Tell me, Son!" Why aren't you picking-up my call, Uncle? "I was just having a sound-sleep..." You had sent Mom's body to Kasi & handed over the ashes too! For some rites or rituals... Could you please repeat! Your Mother... ...wanted to be set in holy-grounds, right? "As you hadn't turned up on-time..." Whom did you give her away to? Come, Come... make it fast! Come on, should u be called singly? What to do? He' quite-aged, anyway... But you're quite blessed, Old-man! You were lying here in your own piss... But after dying, you're happily heading to the Heavens! He'd make it to the Heavens, right...? Of corse! As you have spent all this money... To take this body, all the way to Kasi... Get hold of a local-priest, Complete all the rituals & then burn this body... Only when we handover his ashes he'd make it to Heavens! What is it? "Bro, Tea...?" Tea, Buttermilk... To hold him back you'd bribe with Biriyani, even! Is this even an age to die? Sir... He lived like a King! Damn! Let go... When he was alive, did you give him a Coffee, even? Why're you shedding tears now? "He can rest in peace in our garden, Sir!" What' that...? It is a service-centre for the dead! Understand? Even when you die, your body must come to us! Don't forget... Madam, why are you crying, still? At your age, you'd have seen enough deaths! Wait on a lil' longer, Son -Till his Unc- -What... "His Uncle?" Even his Grandson would be a Grandpa now... Granny... Had he reached before this death, He'd be: Uncle To reach after, makes him, as good as dead! Had he been treated on-time He'd have attended that Uncle' funeral! But, look now...? Fine, take a seat However much you weep or cry He isn't coming back Instead of paying them to lament for him You could help him attain Moksha, in Kasi! Now look... Do not suppress your feelings... You haven't done anything for him when he was alive... Aleast, allow us to fulfill his wishes when he is dead! Understand? These have to be done within a specific time! Is that Uncle more important than his Moksha? Only in death, he' found his peace And you found yours too! Why... Even for me, in doing this service! Hey, lift this body... You lazy-cow, come fast! You mustn't wait for anyone to be reaching... "Body'd start to decay!" Sir.. Oh benevolent-being, delivering the deceased at Heaven' door We believe in you, please take him & leave... You must believe. To Live is to Believe! In the next village, Landlord's house... A lady had passed-away... Even they trusted & gave her body to us! What is troubling you people? Would regal families make hasty decisions? You know nothing, about them? A vehicle from Karunai Charitable Trust came... "Saying that all rituals & formalities were done they gave her ashes too!" Here... This Ash... ...was given by a priest in Kasi! Store it safely under the bed... Understood! "So, evil-spirits & misfortunes, keep-away!" Because someone asked, you gave Mom away? It was wrong, to even let them leave before I reached! & someone comes back with her ashes and... Your 'Love' is the Poison! So you must... Take the ash from that, & apply it for 45 days! Understand? Shall I serve the rest of it? Only then, a child-less home would soon bear a new-life! Understand? Alright...? "Not just when Living," "But even when Dying, no-one must die alone!" "Consciously, I'd never abandon anyone!" "Won't you come & visit your Mother, son?" How are you, Madam...? What is it at this hour, Son? Forgive me, Its about my Mother... What' happened, Son? Her name is, Janaki... She' quite fair-skinned! & very beautiful! Why do you sound like that? All bodies that I cremate were Orphaned... But she has you, right? Her Son! Collecting a body in the pretext of: Cremating it in Kasi, "they're being discarded randomly, Ma'am!" "Who'd do that?" "What is this you're saying?" "It's true, Ma'am!" "Mommy..." "Ma..." "They claim, cremating..." "...and also randomly disposing, elsewhere!" "& wears glittering-earrings!" "Not sure of whom to check with..." "Its been Two-months since her demise!" "Two months...?" "...that was her final-wish!" "Please try recollecting..." "I won't forget the faces of those I send-away, Son!" "Ma... where are you...?" Who're you...? The one in this photo, is she here? Show me! Please, for my sake... Please wait outside, Hold-on! "Its been... around 2 months!" "Why're you troubling, Sir?" "We don't retain the bodies beyond 2 months" Keep moving... "Just get going, now!" Pass the photo, Son... Hey, stop him... Step aside, Sir! Come on... Just a moment... Son... I have seen this lady, Son! Next to the Perundurai railway track! I'd removed her earrings & kept them safe! But I didn't have the heart to sell it... It made me feel very guilty! Now that you are here, her son You may keep it! Careful... "Hello Ma'am, good-morning"! I'm from an Insurance Agency... Leave! Would you like any policy? Ma'am...! "Brindha..." I'm from a small village, near Sulur... One-day, suddenly... I was told, my Mother had died & I went... But I couldn't see her As a Son, I hadn't done, a thing for her What happened to me shouldn't happen to anyone! Please... '"Moksham' is an N.G.O." & I worked as the Office Co-ordinator, Sir Collecting bodies of the dead, for Cremation in holy-Kasi, was the service I liked what I was doing in-there! One-day, Mr. Maaran came looking for me "& enquired about the N.G.O.'s activities..." And mentioned about some crime going-on! "Only then, I understood..." "People send bodies to 'Kasi' believing it'd wash-away their sins!" "But..." "...in the name of a 'free' service!" "Using their strong-beliefs..." "they were collecting dead-bodies & were doing something to them!" "When I passed details of the dead, to Maaran" "...they came & warned me!" "My family was terrified too, Sir!" "We then, moved-away from there!" But, Maaran & Dileep still tried reaching me "I avoided them, Sir" "Maaran must've tried meeting you regarding this" "Only someone from the Medical-field must be behind this!" "I'll try gathering more information, Sir!" "KANNAYIRAM" Your true friend! "Even when I used to work at the Hospital..." "From the Mortuary..." "I'd be asked to burn the unclaimed-bodies!" "Using their strong-beliefs..." "They were collecting the dead-bodies & doing something to them!" "Only someone from the Medical-field must be behind this!" "Those are medicines used by the Forensics & we don't stock them up!" "But only yesterday, stocks got delivered!? Shut up, you!" "Hello..." Who is this? "Kannayiram Sir, its me Brindha..." Tell me, dear... What's the matter... Where? "You've left behind a single child in deep sorrow, Maragadham..." "Hey Manickam, why isn't her son here, still?" "Is he coming or no...?" "Her Brother is confirming this is what she wanted!" "Pack her-up, immediately from here!" "Lets wait a lil' longer..." "Let her Son reach!" "He even ran-away, only after learning of what she'd done!" "Why would he come back?" "Has Mommy done something, you don't approve?" "Ma..." Ma...? Ma... Ma! Ma, forgive me... It is I, who failed to understand you... Ma... Ma... Ma... Ma... Ma... "You uncut-diamond..." "Uncut-diamond, Uncut-diamond..." "My beautiful treasure!" "The leaves are all dried-up!" "My Virtuous woman the green leaves have dried-up!" "Mom, who maintains me is missing..." "Here I'm, yearning for you," "Like a child, longing for love," Sir, what you're doing is a great favor! Oh Mother, please... calm down! "Please rise, we're your family too! " "We'll ensure she is dropped at Heavens doorstep!" "You don't worry about any of it"! "You must stay strong..." "We'll make a move...?" "After losing a liaison!" "Arriving at answers, I shall settle-scores!" "Ready get-down!" "With a Detectiveʼ eyes" "& my Radar-sketch," In eighteen districts, "You may enquire about me!" "Hello..." Finger-prints from the dead-body in Sulur, ...is matching with a Murder in Chennai! "Is it?" Yup "Doctor, regarding the murder in Chennai" "How long has it been, since the murder?" "Must be a week, Sir..." Dr. we found a body in Sulur, right? Yeah... How long has it been since its passing? "...must be Ten-days old!" How could someone who died 10 days ago, kill another, after a week? "Exactly?" "How is that even possible?" I shall find that out! Was the body, missing any organs? Oh no! No organs were missing. I'm sure of that Whatever organ is taken from a dead-body, "It'd be noticed during the post-mortem" "But they are doing something," "...that goes unnoticed. But what?" They're fooling so many & recovering bodies "Breaking all those Families' sentiments" "Why commit such an organized religious crime?" Could they be collecting: Finger-prints? "Remove all identifications from the body & bring the chemicals-box..." But if they only need Finger-prints couldn't it be collected from any dead-body... Why run this elaborate-scheme? When a person dies, ...the Oxygen-level drops "Moreover..." "Blood-circulation stops too" "So, it must be collected immediately after death" "But to do that, a Lab-setup is mandatory!" "and..." "...some chemical processes must be done too!" "I think, that Lab must be inside this Van!" "This is why they're in a hurry to collect the dead-bodies from their homes "Hey Dilli..." Yes... Why is the truck for Kasi, still here? "Hey, hold the arm tightly..." Press it... -Hey... After injecting a dead-body, ...would it rise & dance in Kathakali? Are you out of your mind? Oh my god! Why is he applying ink to his finger? Hey... So... you're planning to rob his fortune with forged documents, uh? I won't let that happen! You, get down here! What are you doing to the dead-body? Hey Dilli... Get him out! "So... with the murder, in Chennai..." They'd have started the investigation with these finger-prints! However much they investigate... ...they would never nab the Killer! And even if they do, Soon they'd know the Killer' is already dead. So... & the case would be closed since the Killer isn't alive! There' a massive forgery-scam behind this! Is it? You dare to embarrass, Me? Now you must pay my money... "...payment is given to your Village-Chief. Now go! Why give it to him? He takes 6 months to return, a borrowed-knife, even If I don't get my money... I'll make a dead-body of you all, & take you to Kasi, myself... Why did you stab me? Are they doing this just for murder-crimes...? Using these finger-prints... A fake-passport, fake-Visa... Why even their identification can be changed... Create a fresh database & sell it to Criminals! Terrorists can use these finger-prints & attack! During Elections, they could create a non-existing person to cast fake-votes too! And a lot more...! They can do so much more... "I'll inform as you cross the border!" Do not let-go... ...be ready! Hey, hold it from under & lift! Hey... come on, make it fast! Signal' changed. Quickly now... Lift-up, now... What are they doing?! How could they do such things? "Hey...Quick. Quick. Come-on up, guys!" "Oh my... the train' started!" "...as long as we're alive," "...we mustn't let anyone die alone!" 'A final wish...' "Please ensure he reaches the holy-ground" "Won't you come to meet your Mother, Son?" "Ma..." "Mother..." "Ma!" "Mother..." "I'm suspecting that Medical shop!" "Why, even Maaran had been there to enquiry!" "Definitely, the fingerprint removing chemical must be in that Medical-Shop!" "If it is found there,Case-closed!" Hey, careful... Higher... Hey, I think we've crossed the border! "Hey, the signal' getting close! Get ready..." Hey... "You dropped it, so close..." "Swing it farther!" "Its okay, bro. It' slid into the bushes "The Spot is here!" Steady...! Swing it far... All of you, hold still! Hey, who is that? Guys, get-up! "How did he get here?" "He' got a gun..." "Visalakshi Medicals" Kannayiram has seen the body by the Sulur Railway track! He'll surely start enquiring! Plan something for him... But Sir... shall I finish him? No-No... We've planned to kill his Uncle anyways, yeah? Let us put that blame on him! Once he is locked-up, He can't come out for10 years! & we'll not have any trouble from him! Forget about that... How many bodies came, last week? Seventeen, Sir! Only Seventeen? What kind of lousy work is this? At this rate, we'll have to shut down the business! & send your fingerprints & mine... Aren't you just getting the fingerprints? What are you using? Its a solution! Hey what is the work you do? My work Sir, is to check the fingerprints! Have you seen the quality of those fingerprints? -Check this... -I did, Sir! Now look, I give you just two days! In that time, I need 50 bodies! From which I need 50 legible fingerprints! -Understand? -"Sure sir!" "Just go, Convince the families!" Go on... Stop looking! "Sulochana!" Aged 38! ...your wife, right? Come! They brought her in for a serious hernia operation! It was I, who treated her! The surgical blade... needs to only be twisted-lightly... & that'd be the end of her story! But I did no such thing! I have only saved every patient who comes to me trustingly, Sir! Pain is only for those who're alive, Sir! Corpses don't have any pain! Then why did you kill Maaran & Dileep? Bad Luck! "Collateral Damage"! "What to do?" "After cheating, so many people," "...bodies have been collected," "breaking all of their family sentiments," Why did you do such an Organized-Religious crime? Good question! Why did- You go on! You're asking, 'Why did I betray people?' People did trust... They have many similar beliefs... & because of such beliefs, many of them ...are cheating them, still! They're not caught, yet! But I'm caught! That's the difference! If all you wanted were the fingerprints, ...you could've taken it from any dead body! Why do thismuch? For the prints to be usable, bodies need to be fresh! People from around believe, going to Kasi after dying is a blessing! What would you do in that case? Think about it!? We'd take the bodies from here! "Simple!" So, did you do all this just for murder-crimes or... "...or is there anything else?" Sending just the finger-prints is upto me! They themselves, commit their crimes! What they do with the prints, send it abroad or to Mars is not of my concern! "It all stems from my childhood trauma." You'll turn sixty when you go to Jail?! The Local Police couldn't do much! Sir, he'd not stop giving explanations. Take him away... -Why're you standing still? Move it... Get him out! Come... Sir-Sir, just one question! Where are you all moving. Come here! Please tell us, Sir... As per Agent Kannayiram' findings, Dead bodies taken from the railway tracks, ...won't remain with Police for more than 3 days. They'll be disposed... As per that loop-hole, ...they've done this brilliantly! After solving this case, where is Agent Kannayiram, now? My Son!
