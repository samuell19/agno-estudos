[♪] [♪] [SCOFFS] Just past the hour. I wonder what delays Affah Dollah. Fear not, most illustrious Hassan Ben Sober. Fear not. Affah Dollah will get the map by hook or crook, as sure as my name is Ghinna Rumma. Quite so. Service. How about a little service? SHEMP: Comin' up here. Yes, sir. Comin' up. LARRY: Yes, sir, we have all the service. At your service. Whew. Boy, if I hadn't ducked, we'd have collided sure. What a narrow escape. [YELPS] [GROANS] SHEMP: What? Wh--? [SHEMP GROANS] What's the matter with you? Take this off. Take this off! Now, take it easy. We'll have you all fixed up in a minute. What's this? Oh, happy birthday. [CHUCKLES] Hold this. Just a minute. I'll take it right off. [GASPS] I would leave it on. People don't know if you're comin' or goin' with this on. There you are, sir. You look very pretty. And the spaghetti is as good as new. Why, you... Moe. Wh--? Dog of dogs, how dare you? A thousand pardons. It was unavoidable. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This would degrade you. 'Tis true. I am an aristocrat. I am Hassan Ben Sober. I had a few too many myself. [LAUGHS] Quiet. We gotta clean up this mess. [HEAD BONKING] Why, you... Ooh! Oh! Get busy. What are you doin'? Stop it, will you? Oh, cut it out. RUMMA: We'll travel by night. Perhaps if Affah Dollah-- Greetings, greetings. Did you bring the map, Affah Dollah? Aye, chief. But as I slit his throat... [GROANS] ...with his dying breath, he said someone else had a duplicate map. 'Tis bad. We must leave at once if we are to be the first to reach King Rootin'-Tootin's tomb. Make preparations to depart immediately. Aye, chief, but remember the curse: He who touches the jewel first is doomed to a thousand deaths. We must secure the services of three, and when we get them to do our bidding: [GROANS] Yes, but we'd best have food before we travel. Aye. Service. Waiters. Service. Here we are. At your service. Oh! Ooh. What'll you have? We want-- We don't have any more. All we got left is rabbit and hot dogs. Rabbit. Hot dog. Hot dog, they'll take rabbit. Okay, comin' up. Comin' right up. Comin' right up. Here we are: pepper and salt. [PUFFS AIR] That busboy's off. [MEOWS] Scat! Come here. Come here, you. [CAT MEOWS] LARRY: We'll have to fix you. Why, you... [LARRY GRUMBLING] [CAT MEOWING] [BOTH CLEAR THROAT] [CHUCKLES] Here. Oh. [MEOWING] [CLEAVER POUNDING] [CAT MEOWS] [CLEAVER POUNDING, CAT YOWLING] [CLEAVER POUNDING] [CAT YOWLS] [CLEAVER POUNDING] [POUNDING STOPS] Catsup. Cat-- Aah! [WHINES] Get outta here. LARRY: Come here, you. Ah, you think you'll get away, eh? Now I got you. Come on. Now I got-- [GRUMBLING] [SIGHS] It couldn't be. Or could it? Now, you stay here and you be a good boy, you. Now, sit there. [DOG BARKS] [GASPS] [BARKS] [DOG YELPS] [CLEAVER POUNDING] [POUNDING STOPS] [GROANS] Here you are, gentlemen. Hot dogs. When it comes to cookin', I'm the cat's meow. [ALL GROAN] Sit down. Oh, but I'm not tired. I'll just stand while you eat. Sit down with your head on or off. Y-You talked us into it. SOBER & RUMMA: Eat! [BARKS] Did you hear anything? Yeah, I did. [MEOWS] [BOTH YELP] Sit down and eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. [DOG WHINING] [CAT PURRING] [CAT MEOWING] [CAT YOWLS] [SNEEZES] Gesundheit. [GASPS] [BARKS] [BOTH SOBBING] SOBER: Eat! Well? Whoa! [GRUNTS] I killed it. I killed it. [SOBBING] Oh, I killed it. Shh. This just can't be. [CAT YOWLS] [SCREAMS, WHIMPERS] [GRUNTS] [HUMMING] Forgot the mustard. So you are the perpetrator of this. Sit down and eat. Sit down. A pleasure. Thank you. Mm-mm-mm. LARRY: Mm. [GROWLS] [YOWLS] [BOTH SCREAM] [ALL SHOUTING] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [CAT YOWLS, DOG BARKS] [GROWLS] [YOWLS] [BOTH SIGH] There's the dog and cat. Why didn't you tell me? What? Shut up. Let him alone. You too. Oh, cut it-- Oof. Come here. Oh! Oh! [LARRY AND SHEMP GRUMBLE] There. Oof. Ooh! [LARRY & SHEMP GRUNT] These three, they are the ones to get the jewel for us. Right. Gentlemen. Who came in? No, you. How would you boys like to make a thousand shilbleenas? Here. You've convinced us. What do we have to do? There is a diamond worth a king's ransom. Do you hear? A king's ransom. Gentlemen, this map will lead us to the treasure. Now, pay strict attention. Huh? [WHIMPERS] RUMMA [READING]: Oh. Ruined. Defeated. That murderous cutthroat. He has the famous 100-carat diamond. A hundred carats? He sure knew his onions. [CHUCKLES] Quiet. This map is useless to me now. With that diamond, I could have quit my job as the doorman at the Oasis Hotel. [BOTH SOBBING] Hey, spinach chin. Do you mean to tell me you're only a doorman? Yes. Well, there's the door, man. [WHIMPERING] [SOBBING] Will you give me 5 for this? No, but I'll give you two. I'll take it. Get out. [GLASS BREAKING] Hey. There's only one 100-carat diamond, and it comes from Rootin'-Tootin's tomb. That's government property. Right, and if we return it, we'll get a big reward. Yeah, maybe 50,000 bucks. Boy, with that kind of money, we could rent a one-room apartment in Hollywood. Maybe. But that Emir of Shmow is a cutthroat. Suppose he cuts my throat? Well? Well? Now, don't worry. We'll be disguised. We'll find the shortest way. Now, here. Study this map closely. MOE: We start here at Jerkola, down the Inseine River, over the Giva Dam, through Pushover, across Shmowland, to the stronghold of Shmow. Pass. [BELLS JINGLING] MOE: Giddyap. Giddyap. Whoa. Halt. Who goes there? STOOGES: Santa Claus. Oh, there ain't no Santa Claus. Oh, yes, there is, and we got a present for you. You have? Right here. [GROANS] [BIRD CUCKOOS] Okay, boys, come on. The coast is clear. Come on. [YELPS] [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Hike. Come on. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HUMMING] Okay, let's find the diamond. [LAUGHING] It's the Shmow. Let's go. [SHMOW CONTINUES LAUGHING] There he is, and he's wearin' the diamond. [LAUGHING] Now is our chance to get it. Yeah. [GROWLING] SHEMP: Fee, fi, fo, fum. I'm the evil spirit that guards the Rootin'-Tootin' diamond. Give it to me lest evil befall you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The spirit commands you to stand on your head in that lily pond until further notice. [GROWLING] Uh-oh. Hide quick. Somebody's comin'. Moe, scram. [ALL GROANING] [STOOGES YELPING] Whoa! Whoa. [WHIMPERS] Here. Hold this. I'll kill you! [GUARD SCREAMS] I'll kill-- Gotcha. Bull's eye. Why, you... Your hat. Thank you. MOE: You're welcome. GUARD: Why-- [YELPS] [GASPS] Well, that's that. Get up here. [GROANS] [WATER SLOSHING] Hey, the Shmow is flooded. [STOOGES LAUGHING] Sister, it looks like you're out of a job. Ha-ha-ha. Where's that diamond, kid? [ALL CHATTER INDISTINCTLY] Hey! Hey! [ALL GRUNTING] [LARRY YELLING] [♪]
