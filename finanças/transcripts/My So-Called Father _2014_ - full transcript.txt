Malin, come now. Hurry, we'll be late. Where is he now? He obviously can't tell time. Or yes, of course he can, but he doesn't bother. Can you wait here by yourself, dear? You can, can't you? Because Mummy has to go to work. You know that, right? - Are you excited to see Daddy's flat? - No. Silly. You get to spend the night there. I don't want to! Stand up now, dear, Daddy will be here soon. Oh good, Gunilla? - Hi there. - Hi...I have a little problem. Oh...? Malin's dad is supposed to come and get her. Could you see that she gets off all right? I have to work. Sure, I'll keep an eye on her. Go on now. Thank you so much! Be a good girl now, Malin. And don't forget to give Daddy your nice present, okay? All right? Mummy? What does Daddy look like? You know. You'll recognise Daddy when you see him. - Turn that off! - Ludwig! From the start, the baby is teeny-tiny, almost like a raspberry, and then it grows and grows. You've seen how my tummy has grown, right? And not because I've eaten too much. How long is a baby in a mum's tummy? - 40 weeks! - 40 weeks. Very good. - And that's really quite a short time. - You said we get to meet the daddy. - Did I? - Yes, several times. - Yesterday, for example. - He's been very busy at work. So he may come when he's not so busy. - Sometimes my dad throws up. - I'm sorry? - Sometimes my dad throws up. - I don't have a daddy! - What's with you? - Shut up! - It's not my fault! - Shut up! - No! - Stop it! Both of you stop that! Linnea... Linnea, we don't swear in the classroom. - Why did you say that to a classmate? - He's not my friend. - He's your classmate. Pick up the book. - No. - Yes, pick up the book. - No. For heaven's sake. I know you don't have a dad, but there's nothing we can't handle, right? Yeah, but you stink of sweat! - Yes, I'm pregnant, so my hormones... - Yeah, poor you, you're pregnant. - Did you know I don't have a dad either? - No. Well, it's true, I don't. So I know how it feels. - Is he dead, too? - No, he isn't dead, he... - I've just never met him. - Then you bloody well have a dad! Linnea, don't swear. Ow! Ow! You don't bite someone because you're mad. No! We don't do that! No matter how mad you get, we don't bite other people. Linnea! Stop that! Calm down! - Stop it. Calm down. - No, no! Linnea! I feel sort of like it's a little too calm. - It looks fine. - Can you go back, so I can get the arm? - Like this? - Yes, stop! Perfect, thanks. - It looks great. - I promised I would text this to Dad. - She's doing fine in there. - What? - How about not letting us know the sex? - Oh, I thought you knew...? - Malin, you said you wanted to know...? - Well, I haven't heard anything about it. - I think you can let Malin talk now. - Oh, of course, go ahead, Malin, talk. I've had some problems recently... and I'm afraid it's affected the baby. Could it? Well... It is a good idea to take things easier while pregnant. Yes. Absolutely. But you can't just stop being human for nine months. - I know she's having the baby, but I... - Could you give us a moment, Frank? Yes, yes, of course. I can be the stupid man standing in the hall. Go ahead and make me an idiot. I'm just trying to be a part of this. - I'm sorry. - It's no problem. Here, wipe that off. Pregnancy is difficult. Do you have someone you can talk to? Er, yes. Of course. - Your parents, perhaps? - I'm just glad the baby's all right. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you mad? - No, are you? I have to say something without censoring myself. I think you have some unreasonable demands of me. - I don't demand anything. - Yes, you do. - I'm to be a dad before the baby's here. - Maybe it's... - Why? Explain. - Maybe I'm a bit... Maybe I don't dare to believe you'll still be here when it comes. - Can't we just be nice, like before? - Like before? Aren't relationships supposed to evolve? - Can't we get help? - I don't need help. I already know what the problem is. I'm listening. I know I'm not allowed to say this. The first five years, it was exciting that you were so secretive. But then I realised you weren't secretive, you were just empty. Are you breaking up with me? Am I too stupid to understand? Just because your dad left you doesn't mean I'll leave my kid. - Don't talk about him. - Don't compare me with him. He's like a bloody ghost haunting our relationship. Your dad. How many times have you packed that bag? You'll be back tomorrow. Maybe not this time. Can't you stay and argue instead of running away? Why? You just broke up with me. That's your interpretation. Malin, let's do this: You stay here until you find a flat of your own. You are pregnant. I'll sleep on the couch, it's okay. See, I'm nice, I'm not the devil. - Goodbye. - Why so dramatic? We're going to be seeing each other for the next 18 years, so come on. Come now. No. No. No. Ow! Why the hell are you biting me?! - Hi. - Dad, call my mobile before you come. - You can't just barge in. - I thought you were at work. Hi. I've brought some leftover lasagne. I'll put it in the fridge, okay? Everything all right? Frank, did I hear you shout just now? We were just joking around. And thank you for the wonderful ultrasound pictures. What an amazing thing. A real human, with hands and toes and everything. Oh, I see... - Did I walk in on an argument here? - No, nothing serious. What did he do now? I think you should give him the cold shoulder for a while. He needs a bit of resistance, the little pig. - I think I bring out the worst in him. - No, Malin. Don't think like that. You're a hell of a good person, I know that. Oh, by the way... The only camp bed I have is in Frank's old bedroom. - I hope it still works. - Right... I'm a bit concerned when you say you don't have any friends. Of course I have friends. But they were all Frank's friends to begin with. What about your colleagues at the school? Colleagues aren't someone whose sofa you can sleep on. No... What about your friends from home? - The gravy! Shit! - Bloody hell. - Well, that's no gravy for us. - I'd really miss you, Malin. You're like a daughter to me. I've actually wished I was your daughter many times. - Get the wine glasses, I'll get the door. - Who's coming? Hi. - All right? - Fine. - Everything ready? - Eh, yes. Give this a chance now. - That's your advice? - Yes. Like you and Mum? Sleep in separate rooms for 10 years, then get divorced? - That's like a car crash in slow-motion. - Car crash in slow-motion...! You didn't make that up. You read it somewhere. No matter. I don't know what's wrong with you. There's no one better than Malin! It feels weird having you analyse me when I'm sitting here. I agree, it is weird. But you'll have to take that up with him. The weed-smoking psychologist. There he is, all relaxed and open-minded. Fine, ruin everything. I for one plan to stay close to Malin, anyway. Believe me. - Is it my fault you don't have a dad? - Hang on. That was cruel. - Bloody cruel. - You're my dad, hold my hand. Hold my hand. Here, hold my hand. Here, hold my hand, too. Take it. Take my hand! Bloody kid! - You can't just leave. - Stay out of it. Just stay out of it. We can manage fine without your advice. - I'm just trying to fix things. - You're making it worse. - With a nice dinner? - It wasn't nice. - I'm leaving now, I'm not staying here. - What? - Where will you go? - I'm going to find my father. What father? My so-called father. China Theatre BENNY'S GERMS You don't have to tell anyone that I was resting here, right? No, I don't have anyone to talk to, so don't worry. Good, because I was just resting. What are you staring at? Never seen a doctor before? Hellooo? Yes...I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see! Yes. There was no one there. Next! - Dr Pringle, I have such problems! - I'm so glad! Drop your trousers and bend over so I can give you a shot! - But you haven't heard my problem! - I can see that you need a sedative. I've been a doctor since 1900 ptrblbl boombababoom. It's a clear case of TB, HIV, OAP, TGIF and LSD. - Tell me your problems. - I'm a pathological liar! And that's such a problem because I'm a politician. - I see... - Yes! Writer's cramp! Drop your trousers and bend over for a shot! Let's see that arse! Arse, bum, backside, oh, let me see your backside! Show your bum now, bare that derriere! The myst'ry of life has no solution, so raise your rump and set it tootin' my son! When life's got you down, in permanent frowns, and all is dark and grey, just let the trumpet sound, drop your trousers to the ground and give your rosy backside just a little wave! Arse, bum, backside, oh, let me see your backside! Show your bum now, bare that derriere! The myst'ry of life has no solution, so raise your rump and set it tootin' my son! Fart, fart, fartin', make sure to put your heart in! When the pressure's too high, just let that rocket fly. The myst'ry of life has no solution, so raise your rump and... I don't want to! and set it tootin' my son! Don't want to! Don't want to! Don't want to!! You wanted to talk, Lasse? You are aware that you go a little faster for every show? - In a hurry to get to the bar? - No, no... I don't give a shit about that. But you're rushing me. I'm glad you brought that up. I've thought so too. - I suppose I'm too enthusiastic. - Martin... When it's my line, I have the ball. And when it's your line, I have the ball. - I set the pace. - Absolutely. Of course. - Deal? - Deal. Are you coming to the party on Saturday? You haven't RSVP'd. - Shall I RSVP for you? - Well, er... You wouldn't like to make a speech? Something simple? Goodbye. - Goodbye. - OK. - So, who's coming to the Pelican Pub? - Me! I am! - OK, I'll wait outside! - Be right there! Hi, thanks for the show. It was great. - Great? - Yes, really. If you want something good, go to the Royal Theatre. This is pure crap. You want an autograph, I suppose. He'll be out soon. - Can't we go to the Mill Bar instead? - No, the Pelican! Martin Sandahl, 30 years on stage. Come and celebrate, 27 March - Liquorice shots... - Listen up, everyone. Raise your glasses. Cheers! Come on! This is a dance! - That wasn't funny. - Sure it was. Sit down now. Here's to genus, Bacchus, Anus! Anus! ANUS!! ANUS!! - Tone it down, Martin. - Shut up, Stickan. I said, shut up. That's enough for today. Goodbye... - Goodbye, Martin, see you again soon. - Shut up, Stickan. This is my living room. You're... You waiter, me guest. Learn your part, you sack of shit. Can you walk, or should I call security? Humiliating or dignified, it's your choice. Stickan, when it's my line, I have the ball. When it's your line, I have the ball. - Hello? -Hi, it's Frank. Dad got you a flat, a bedsit. He knows some landlord. It is in a suburb, but it's a start. - I don't need it, I'm staying with my dad. -What? -I'm with him now. I don't need the flat. - You found him? -OK... What's he like? - What's he like? He's not afraid to say no. In fact, we've sort of chosen the same profession. - I sort of see myself in him. - Wait, what are we talking about? - Same profession? - We both perform. Him on the stage and me in a classroom. We're sort of a bit similar. Perform? What are you talking about? You're so cute. You don't perform. - I do. -No you don't. You're not a performer. Could I have a bit of silence here? Would all be so kind as to shut the fuck up?! Thank you. Martin, you're celebrating a bit of an anniversary today. That's why we're here. 30 years on the stage. There's a bit of true method acting. That's Martin, big gestures, small roles. That's something of your specialty. Grand expressions in the small roles. But what do we know about this workhorse? We know everything about your mother, the great actress. She won this for "The Punishment". An incredible film and an incredible actress, your mother. But tonight is about you, Martin. So, who the hell is Martin Sandahl? To find out, I've prepared a little contest for your kiddie party here. They're multiple-choice questions, easy peasy. Does he have children? Does Martin have children? - No. - No, right? Not him. Hello! Hello! You in there, too! Now it's my turn, the workhorse's, to say a few words. - Just so you know... - Louder! - I haven't had the role of a lifetime yet. - No. - And I haven't met one good director. - There aren't any! No, that's true. And I've stood on every stage in this country except for the Royal Theatre. I've said no to them every year. I say no every year. Because I'll only perform there at my peak, and then you'd better watch out! Good, spontaneous. Did you plan that out? Look here, this is me. And here's a year - don't look now. Here's the question: does anyone know how old I was, when I first started to dream of being an actor? Guess. - 25? - Anyone? - 24! - 10! No, 12, this big. 1972. I got to go to the Royal Theatre and see the Wild Duck, directed by Ingmar. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. I saw Ernst Hugo JÃ¤regÃ¥rd, Max von Sydow, what a group, Lena Nyman! So close I was sprayed with their saliva. What are you laughing at? Are you an idiot? Hey! I'm talking to you! - It was just funny! Sprayed with saliva. - What do you work with, Anna? - You know I work at Cream. - You work in a coffee shop! Fucking interesting, but we're actors here, you get that? Bit of a difference. Shut up. Actors... - No, that's not the right title... - Welfare recipients! I'd describe actors as researchers of the human condition. We dig down into every pore, down to our emotions. You're talking about Benny's Germs at the China Theatre, aren't you? - Sorry, you just set that up so perfectly. - That's fine, Lasse. - Into every pore... - I'm almost through. I don't have a family. The theatre is my family. You're my family. I love you all. Theatre is more important than life. To theatre! Could I have some wine, please? Excuse me... - Do you know who I am? - Do I know who you are? A gift for you. - Thanks. I'll open it later. - No, open it now. It has a story. You'll understand who am if you open it. There's a point to this. Please open it! Open it! You have a really yappy voice. I don't like it. You're at my house. This is my party. Didn't anyone teach you any manners? Martin, I hope you weren't offended by the workhorse thing. What you said about a kiddie party was bloody unnecessary. That was wrong, a clumsy formulation. I should have said youth centre. Is there anyone here who is over 30? I don't think so. - He's just as stupid as his mother. - Sorry? - Who was his mother? - She's dead. - Right, but who was she? - The Royal Theatre Bitch. This is her old flat. Can't you sense the darkness? Do your bloody homework. Oh god. Does he have a pulse? Tilt his head so he can breathe! Can someone call an ambulance? Tilt his chin up so he can breathe! - Is anyone coming with him? - I will. Hang on, who are you? - I'm his daughter. - Martin doesn't have a daughter. - Yes he does. - No, I know Martin, I know he doesn't. - No, no one's going with him. - OK. "No, no, no," says Elephant. "Yuck, yuck, yuck," says the Liquorice Troll angrily. What are you doing? - Reading a comic. - I see. - Where is your mummy? - I don't know. - Are you Daddy? - Me? No. I'm sure she'll be here soon. Your mummy will be here soon. - This is Malin. -Am I speaking to Malin Andersson? - Yes, that's me. -This is SÃ¶der Hospital in Stockholm. Your father was brought in a few days ago, did you know that? Could you hold on a second? Just a moment. - Mobile phones aren't allowed. - Yeah, turn it off! Keep writing, I'll be back soon. - OK, now I can talk. -Good. - Is he dead? -No. I'm calling because you're his only living relative according to our files. We're required to inform you. -Because he can't call you himself. - OK. I understand. Thank you for calling. Goodbye. Excuse me, I got a call today. I'm Martin Sandahl's daughter. Yes, you spoke to me. I'm Emma. He's at the end of the hall, round the corner to the right. Room 9. Oh! Hi. OK... Excuse me, could I talk to a doctor? About Martin Sandahl, room 9? - Martin? - Sandahl. Hi. Good to meet you. - I'm Malin. - Manuel. OK... Martin has had a minor brain haemorrhage. - A brain haemorrhage? - Yes. He's recovering quite well. OK... - The problem now is... - Is he paralysed? No, but he seems to have lost most of his memory about who he is and so on. OK... He doesn't seem to be able to provide any information on his past. - Shall we sit down? - OK. Here, have a seat. So, I don't think he really knows who he is. He doesn't know who he is... Most people remember who they are but have difficulty with new memories. But he has lost most everything. Is this a temporary thing? We don't really know; it's quite unusual. There are similar cases described in the literature, but I've never seen it myself. It's usually due to a minor injury in a strategic location. - So now he's sort of a blank slate. - A blank slate? Yes. He'll have to start from scratch with a lot of things. A blank slate... Yes. Can you get a brain haemorrhage from being upset? Because just before this happened, he was pissed off at me. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. There are so many factors... ...that cause this. Are you ready to see him? Yes, let's. Hello, Martin. How are you today? I have someone here with me I think you may recognise. This is your daughter, Malin. Remember? That you have a daughter? Do you remember that you have a daughter, Martin? No... Do you remember when you were born? - When were you born, Martin? - 3 October '81, I've told you. '81, are you sure about that? - 1981, not 1881. - No... Malin, I'm going to have you talk to the counsellor about all the practical details. - OK? - OK. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Sign here and confirm that you've received Martin's wallet and keys. - Wallet and keys? - Yes, I think you should have them. - How old are you? - How old am I? I'll be 32 soon. - How old am I? - Look at these lovely flowers! Aren't they nice? I have to go now... Hi there, are you Martin Sandahl's relative? Let me shut this. Have you reported to the Social Insurance Agency? You have to do that. - Does he have any private insurance? - I don't know, I don't know him very well. - No, sometimes that's the case. - We're not very close. It's not easy when you don't have any family. - I'm not judging, I'm just informing. - I didn't grow up with him. - No, no. - So I really don't know him. If you need more information, we have several courses about stroke, brain haemorrhage, aphasia, speech difficulties... Just read this brochure. And here is a certificate of disability. Which you can use at the bank to pay bills from his account. If you have any questions, my number is at the bottom. Hi. Martin is in the day room. Hi. - Don't you recognise me? - Of course I do. You work here. - No, I'm Malin. - Yes. 3 October '81. - That's my birthday. - No, it's mine. - You're turning 32? - 32? I'm your daughter. This is so uncomfortable. Can you get the stage manager to sign me out? Bloody uncomfortable. Excuse me. Will I need to tell him who I am every time we meet? Sorry to interrupt your lunch, but he didn't recognise me again today. It's difficult to say. I really can't predict how far he'll progress. Is it something we can train up? Stimulate his memory somehow? Yes, I'll talk to the occupational therapist. But between you and me, a lot depends on you, the family members. So... So it's my job to take care of him? You have a very important task now. Tell him who he is, show him things that can help him remember. Old family photos... It's up to you... ...to fill in the blanks and teach him who is. Martin's first day of school Daddy's turning 30! Happy birthday from Malin Hi, Daddy! It's the summer hols and we're going to the arckipellago. Martin is in occupational therapy. Round the corner and all the way down the corridor. Please, Martin, your clothes will get dirty. Just put this on. No! I don't want it! So then, how do we cook the egg? Now we're practising with the cooker off. What do you do with the egg, Martin? Is that how you fry it? No, right? Yes, that's good. That's it. And then? No, you crack the egg first, right? Is that my daughter? - It's my daughter! - Yes, but Martin, let's finish this first. - I think you can wait, can't you? - Yes, no problem, Martin. I'll wait. Come now, let's continue with this. How do you crack the egg? - How do you crack it? - I don't want to. Why don't you give it a try. If you just try... - I don't want to. Not right now. - I think you could if you just... No! I don't want to. - Show me how you do it. - Stop directing me, damn it! Bloody hag! You can get angry, but you're not allowed to call me names. Do you understand? So now I submit this... ...kitchen test to the consultant. - Aha, kitchen test? - Yes. Then the consultant takes over. - Can I talk to him? - To her. She's at a training course right now. So what you're telling me right now is that nothing is going to happen? - That's right. - I see. He can stay here if he wants to. - But will he get occupational therapy? - Not until a treatment plan is set up. - Those are the rules. - OK... This is going to be fine! You just need to be patient. - I'm leaving. - You're always leaving. - I have a job, you know. - Then I'm not talking to you. Call me if you're sad. You can call me if you're happy, too. Moss evolved 450 million years ago. That's a long time, isn't it? - We have 1000 different types of moss. - Yeah, didn't you know? - Almost every kind is green. - Mobile phones aren't allowed! That's right! Turn it off now! - Hello? -It's me. I want chocolate. Chocolate now! - Can't you ask the nurse? - No one cares about me here. - It's a prison. Come here now. - I can't do that, Martin, I'm teaching. - I can't. - Are you cruel? I want chocolate! Just because you want chocolate, you can't make someone go out and buy it. - Come here now! - No one buys chocolate for me either. You're bloody selfish! Moss. There are a thousand species in Sweden. For God's sake! Yes? Hi, is he in there? - They're in town working on shopping. - Well, that's good. Could you do me a favour and give him this chocolate when they get back? - Who are we talking about now? - I'm talking about Martin Sandahl. Aha. He isn't out shopping. We don't have a treatment plan for him yet. Do you know where he is? Because he's not in the ward. He was here before, but it's not my responsibility to keep track of him because he's not a patient here. For God's sake! - Hello? Martin, is that you? -They've locked me in! I can't breathe! -I can't breathe! Hello? - Try to open the lock! -They've shut me in here! - Turn the lock knob. Slowly, try doing it slowly. Turn. -I'm suffocating! - Turn the knob slowly in one direction. I don't know what you mean. - I've been in there for two days now. - No, you've only been there a while. - We're going home now. - Yes. - Good, take him back to the ward. - No, we're going home now. He needs to be discharged by a doctor. He could be in the middle of treatment! Then call me! Open up! Happy birthday Daddy Hello? Hello? Daddy? - Who sleeps here? - You sleep here. This is your bed. Jesus, what a boring person! No personality! Sure you do... And I sleep in here! Come and see! No, no, this doesn't feel right. You can't sleep on a camp bed. You're pregnant; you should sleep in a real bed. I'll be OK here. - Good. - How long do I fry it? You fry it until it looks good. You can see that for yourself. Good, very good. And now? - I can do it! I can fry an egg! - Good. Cutlery. Malin? Now I know what's been missing in my life here. No! No, no, no, no! Absolutely not! You don't drink beer. You don't drink any alcohol. - Oh no? - You never have. - But it smells good. - Go and wash your hands now. Go and wash your hands, Martin. Brush properly. Keep going until it's done. What's that? - Height measurements... - What does that say? 160 cm, 12 years. - You were pretty tall for your age. - I guess I was. Was I a good dad? - Yeah. - Thank you. Good night. - What is it, Martin? - I feel so sorry for myself. Hi there. A latte to go, please. Malin, in the middle of morning coffee. Yes, that's me. What?! Where is he now? Okay, I'll be there, thanks. I don't have time, sorry. Hi, I'm the one you called. Was there a fire? We had a lot of smoke in the kitchen, but no fire. - We've aired the place out. - What happened? - I was just going to fry some eggs. - It's bad to forget things on the cooker. - So remember that. - Remember that. - He shouldn't be on his own, should he? - No. I recognise this! I recognise it. - This song means something. - We have the same taste in music. - What taste? - Good taste. Should it make me happy or sad? - You decide that for yourself. - Happy. - Did I mess up? - Maybe a little. But that doesn't matter. You're only human, for heaven's sake. Can you tell me a little bit about Mum? What do you remember about her? My mum, I mean. You must remember something. Where is she? Dead. - What did she die of? - Cigarettes, you might say. I work with something artistic, don't I? It felt like that when I was dancing. You don't feel anything at all when I say that she's dead? I'm an author, right? - Why do you think that? - I don't have any friends. You're an actor. She's disappointed in me, isn't she? There. I have a little question. Well, actually a big one. - Where's the baby's father? - He's not in the picture right now. Why not? - It's nothing dramatic. - Nothing dramatic? He's a pig, isn't he? He should take responsibility. He can't let his child down. It's unreasonable! - He needs a good thumping! - Don't do that! I'm actually starting to remember a bit. And this is it! You grew up with me in this flat, and now you've moved back since the so-called father of your baby was mean. He bloody well has no right to call himself the father! - I don't know... - Tell me what you think! - I can't tell what you're feeling! - You don't want to know. Yes I do. Come into my home, take the double bed, don't worry about it, but don't fucking lie to your own father! I used to push you in this swing. I remember that! - Martin... - "Higher, higher!" Stubborn as a goat. - You were so damned cute. - School starts in 15 minutes, we're late. Do you remember when you fell through here that one time, and I ran carrying you to the hospital to get stitches? Do you remember how I ran with you in my arms? You got 11 stitches... Come now, we have to hurry. I'm running, all covered in blood. She's bleeding! My daughter is bleeding! My daughter is bleeding, she's bleeding, she's bleeding! Martin, don't shout like that, there are neighbours who are trying to sleep. You can't shout. People are trying to sleep. Please! - I have to go. - She's bleeding! Out of the way! Here I come! This is my daughter, here I come. Elbows out, I fight through the crowd. Blood is pouring over us. Don't you remember that? Can I see the scar? You can't see it, there's hair in the way. We have to go now. I recognise this. We've walked here before. - We've walked here many times. - But Martin... Hand in hand. You were shy and I had to come in with you. And you had a rucksack with a sunflower on it. They teased you! Martin, that man is the father of the man I'm having my baby with. He's really nice, so we're nice to him. Stay calm. - In fact, just sit and wait on this bench. - Sure. Hi, Malin. Frank has been trying to reach you. Are you intentionally avoiding him? - No, I just haven't had time to answer. - Martin. - Malin's dad. - What? Oh! That's you? How nice! I'm Magnus, Frank's dad. Yes, right. - Isn't it nice that you found each other. - What do you mean? - My class is starting. Can I call you? - "Found each other"? Frank has tried to reach you. You haven't answered. I think that's odd behaviour. You are about to have a child together. Why isn't Frank here to talk about this? Isn't that odd? - It's not your place to discuss this. - No, I know. - I'd like to talk about child rearing. - Martin, I told you to wait. - Frank hasn't been very involved. - I know he's an ass. Please, dear, for my sake, can't you get in touch with him? - Don't touch my daughter. - Stop! - Your son deserves a beating. - Hang on... - You haven't taught your son manners. - Stop this. - Can I call you, Magnus? - Get out. - I'll call you later. - Now I have to go to class. - Let's be nice, OK? Good, then we're nice. Hello, children. We have a guest today. His name is Martin and he's just going to sit and listen for a while if that's OK. - Good. - Is that your boyfriend? No, he's my father. Martin is here because he's so curious about what I do and how I work and what our classes like. He's very nice. - You said you didn't have a dad. - Why did you say that? - I didn't. - Yes you did. - No, Linnea, I didn't. - Yes you did. - No. - She did. Didn't you hear her say no? You know, we could... - Why don't we start with reading. - A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O. - That's good, Martin. - P Q R S T U V X Y Z Ã… Ã„ Ã–. No fucking problems. No fucking problems. Is your dad special-needs? You want a beating, you little shit? Her kind ruin lives. - Martin! - Mind your own business! Linnea! Linnea, wait! OK, here's the thing. Martin had something called a brain haemorrhage. Have you heard of that? It's when a blood vessel breaks in the brain and you have to learn everything again, like reading and writing and maths. - How much does he understand? - He's learning all the time, just like you. Shut up, all of you. Your dad is weird. It is a little strange, having to be a mummy for your own dad. Miss! Miss! Miss! - Yes, Ludwig? - Maybe it'll be better when he grows up? Shut up! No, Martin, pick those up! Pick up the jackets. Hey! Pick up the jackets, Martin! - You have bullies in there! - No I don't! You called Linnea a little shit! Don't you know they talk to their parents? - I'll hear about this, believe me! - You don't understand how I feel! You, you, you! Don't you want to hear about me? You haven't once asked who I am, how I feel, what I think. All you have to do is say it. Sit here and wait for me and don't come into the classroom again. I don't know why I'm dragging you around anyway! I'm sorry. "Cycle means that everything goes around" "and comes back again." No, Martin! I told you to wait for me on the bench. - Listen... - Martin... Have a chocolate. - Keep quiet about me at home. - Martin... - You can see I'm pretty nice. - Malin... - Could I speak to you after school? - Yes. - Have we met? - No. I'm the head teacher. - I'm Malin's dad. - I see. OK. I hear you. It was totally wrong. I won't bring him back. Good. It was an emergency, I didn't know what to do with him. I won't do it again. You're not sleeping in the pillow room anymore, are you? - No. - OK. Another thing - is there a list of pupils who have attended the school? I'm sure there is. Why are you lying like that? I feel sad. I'm thinking about when you were a child. - What happened when I was a child? - They hit you, they teased you. I wasn't teased. - Yes you were. - No I wasn't. They hit you... You were a pupil here, Martin, not me. You started here in the autumn of 67. They flushed your hat and the toilet overflowed. It's your school. Not mine. - Martin, what is it? - Knives in my head! Martin! Martin, sit down properly. - Ow, ow, knives! Knives in my head! - Martin, try to... Martin! Martin! Hello! Help! Can you call an ambulance? Hello. I've looked at the CT scan with the consultant. There are no visible changes since the last time. There's no new haemorrhage. His blood circulation looks good. How do you think he's doing? What can I say...? He's... I think he seems to have good chances of continuing this positive development. - Did you not hear me ringing the bell? - No. I didn't. Don't you live with your dad? He's sick and they want me to take care of him. - I don't know if I can. I don't know him. - Why'd you look for him? You hate him. Frank... Look... I'm working. This isn't a good time. - Is someone here? - Hanna from work. It's a meeting. - Meeting? - Yes, meeting. What the hell? You've moved out! Give me the keys. Don't be like this. Hi. I'm Malin. - Hanna Berg. - Hanna Berg? Hi. - I should leave. - No, don't. I'm only here to get some things. I used to live here. - Wait in the kitchen, we need to talk. - Of course. Those slippers are mine. - I see you drink wine while working. - I don't know. No. But Frank does. So, how do we do this? - You'll call me when your water breaks? - No, I'll call you when it's over. I can't be there when my own child is born? The way things are now, that feels like a private thing, Frank. So no. I get it. You are a strong person, Malin. That's admirable. I'm not being ironic. Does she live here? Well, not really. It's my flat. - I feel so bloody foolish. - I'm not evil for not living with you. Forget about having anything to do with the baby. And there it is. I was waiting for that. You're not worthy. You enjoy yourself while I carry your child. So you're going to repeat history. Very clever. No, stay. This isn't your fault. You shouldn't leave, I should. Go on with your assignments. - Is that a joke, Miss? - Yes, I'm just joking. Stay in your seat, Linnea, it's all right. Linnea, go back to your... - You don't smell of sweat anymore. - That's good. Get back to work now. We have a nice life. I'm back, aren't I? The garlic press, where is it? Can you look in the cupboard? What theatre do I work at? The Royal Theatre, right? Let's take one thing at a time, otherwise it will be too much for you. WHO THE HELL IS MARTIN? Forget the garlic press, we'll slice it instead. Have some potatoes. Aren't you hungry? Who are you if I don't have any children? Eh? At that party, they filled in those papers. One says I'm a vegetarian, one says I studied in MalmÃ¶, one says I'm a pacifist, but not one says I have a daughter! Not one. No one wrote I have a daughter! - Who the hell are you? - Your daughter. - But I've never had a dad. - What? Come here. These are your height marks, not mine. This is M for Martin, not Malin. I've never lived here. You never ran to the hospital carrying me. You were bullied in school, not me. Perhaps you've already realised that. - That's you. - You made me up! What a nasty trick. - We made it up together. Jointly. - I didn't do anything jointly. Can't we just move on, now we know each other? I want to be who I was, not someone you made up. Then you have to ask someone else. I don't know who my father was. Fuck. - Where will you live? - This is your flat. I'll get by. If you apologise for manipulating me, you can stay. - We're going out. - Oh no. I'm not going anywhere. Now! Here. Take them, they're yours. This isn't the Royal Theatre. - This is your family. - Oh, hi, Martin. Hi. Martin is here. - I'll be damned. Good to see you. - Thanks. Thank you very much. You've been to hell and back. Strokes are a nasty business. But we've been thinking of you. Well, I have to get ready. Great seeing you. Bye. Hi! You didn't think of me. I didn't get a single flower. Look, Martin, I really have to prepare. We have two performances today. The show must go on, even if the world is ending. It may seem shallow, but that's it. You just keep going. I'm sorry, Martin. I haven't been timing them or anything, but it hurts like hell. Can I come in right away? I'm all alone here. Please? Obstetrics, SÃ¶der Hospital. - You don't have anyone with you? - No, it's just me. - Hi, Malin? Welcome. - Oh, excuse me! Don't apologise. - Are we waiting for someone? - No, it's just me. - Should I phone someone? - There's no one to phone. - Just don't pity me. - I don't. I'm Malin too, a midwife. Down the hall. Relax your legs. Lower your bum. Breathe slowly, Malin, you're doing great. Good job. Make sure to relax and enjoy being out of pain. It doesn't hurt now, does it? No. Super. Great. You're going to do just fine. You want to lie down a while? Can you move a bit higher up? Take this, and breathe very slowly into it. That's good, really good. Long, deep breaths. Excellent. I want to go home! I want to go home! I know, but we're going to get through this. You can do it. Let me take this now, so you don't get dizzy. You'll get really dizzy. I don't want this baby. Is the baby bearing down now? It sounds like it's time to start pushing. Let me get these pants off you. - You don't have any pains now? - No. I need you here now. Hello? Here, hi! Everything is fine, we'll manage. Don't worry. I can't, I can't, it hurts, I can't. Is the baby bearing down now, Malin? I don't want to do this! Don't push now, Malin, it's not time yet, wait a little. Is that another pain? You're welcome to hold on to me, but don't hurt me. - I think it's time to examine you. - I feel like I'm going to shit myself. Now push! That's great! Super! That's good! Great! Just a little more... Hold your breath... Hang in there... Good work. Hi. I just don't understand house. - I understand it, but I've never felt... - What's he saying? It makes me puke. Hi. I'm OK. I have someone who wants to meet you. A baby gym... Is it too much? No, I think it's good. In a while, maybe. Unreal... Hi little girl, aren't you beautiful. - Good work, Malin. - Thanks. Soon you'll be put to work. Of course. She looks like you, doesn't she? She has your mouth, I think. - What's her name? - I don't know. What you think? I don't know. You did the work, you should decide. - I think we should decide together. - She's... I don't know what to say. - I'm really going to take this seriously. - Well of course you will...? - I just said I would. - Well, good. - Can I try taking her for a walk? - Of course, she's your baby! - I'll wait here. - What, you're not coming? Go now. - That went great! A full circuit! - Yes... - Your irony is duly noted. - You can handle it, right? Yes, I can handle it. Can't you keep that at your place? She'll be there half the time. - But not yet. - Why not? - Well, you're nursing, aren't you? - There is milk formula, Frank. Yes, but... - OK... - Right. But I... This isn't going to be easy to say, but I've got a... I have to go to London for work. A year. I have to. You can't. Your baby is here. - Yes, but I'll be home on the weekends. - But you're a dad now, Frank, not later. You take care of her. Good luck. You know what? You're a bloody shit of a dad if you leave. Right, I hear what you're saying, but I'm just like you, I'm doing my best, we all are, right? It's your privilege to be mad at me. - I choose not to be so mad at you. - You're a shit of a dad if you leave. Well, if I'm such a pain, then I'll take this and go. Yes? We've let the audience in. Do you need anything? - Yes, I need to be left alone. - No problem. Yes? Why didn't I have a dad? Let's go for a walk. Ten minutes to curtain. Ten minutes. Well? I was 21 when you were born. That's pretty young. Yes, but you were 31 when I was 10 and 40 when I finished school. Malin, your mother didn't want to have an abortion. - And now that abortion is standing here. - Yes. - I don't like your tone. - When I was little... Orchestra, places. When I was little, you were meant to pick me up and I was to stay with you. Mum must have told me this, I don't remember it. I sat alone at the door and waited. And waited and waited. And waited and waited, but you never came. I was going to give you this then. - What th... What is it? - It's a phone. - A phone? - From the 80s. I have something for you too. I've been planning this. I've made duplicates of my keys. Come and live with me now. You can have the double bed, I can watch the kid. Hi, it's Granddad. - Can I hold her? - No. I don't want you to. I met your mother when we were both working in the cloakroom at Maxim. She got pregnant just as I got into drama school. In MalmÃ¶. A long ways away. So that wasn't good. - I planned to visit you every weekend. - I thought about you every day. - I'm sorry, what I mean is... - No, no, stop. I... Why is theatre more important than life? You said that at your party. Your show is starting. Forget it. - You bloody idiot. - Yes... Martin? Martin, you're on in five. Pella, are you coming? - Can I bring the ball? - No. - Yes. - Can't it stay at Mummy's? We'll have to go up and call him. Hi. Hi, Pella! - Look! Who's that? - Daddy! Hi, Pella! Can you run to daddy? - I'll pick you up next week! - Upsy daisy! Everything good? Good. Friday at 5 o'clock?
