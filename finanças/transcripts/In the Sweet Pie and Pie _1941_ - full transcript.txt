Have been ordered to Honolulu. See you in a few months, love Tom, Dick, and Harry." If we're not married by midnight tonight, we can kiss the $10 million legacy goodbye. We're sunk. No, you're not. A smart lawyer's never sunk. I read about the fleet going to Honolulu, so I figured out a little plan to save your inheritance. Well, let's have it. Simple. Today you marry three convicts. Tomorrow they hang. You get your $10 million, minus my fee, of course, and you're free to marry your boyfriends. Nice, huh? But what about the convicts? Yeah, how about that? There they are. ALL: Ooh. They can't hang us. We're innocent. We're innocent, I tell you. You're telling me. Well, they're gonna hang us. Oh, no. No. I'm too young to die. I'm too young and too handsome. [GRUNTS] Well, I'm too young. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Hold that. Oh, thank you. Listen, you, we got 24 hours to live. Think. Think. Think. [JACKHAMMER HAMMERING] Attaboy. Attaboy. Think it up. I got it. What? A terrific headache. Ha-ha, he stuck-- Come on. Listen, we gotta get out of here. If we only had a saw. Hey, what about these? Wow. Where'd you get these? I save bottle tops. Is this a musical saw? Certainly. It plays "I Hear a 'Ripsody.'" [CRIES OUT] That was a "rhapsody" in the kisser. Come on. Get on those bars, quick. [SAWWING] Wait a minute.

This is your old friend Bill Stein, bringing you a jerk-by-jerk description of the triple hanging of the mushroom murder mob. This broadcast is coming to you from Hangemall Prison. We're at the gallows' side, and it's a beautiful day for a hanging. Peanuts, popcorn, soda pop, chewing gum, candy. Get your programs, gents, all the names and numbers. You can't tell the victims apart without a program. Program? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [COUGHING] Hey, hey, hey. You better watch that cough. First thing you know, you'll wind up with pneumonia.

LARRY: Hey, that's my head there. Stay tuned, and I'll bring you a word from the contestants. You're free. The governor's pardoned you. "Mickey Finn and his gang have been captured, and they've confessed to the mushroom murder." You're free, boys! STOOGES: We're free. Here, boys, say a few words, will you?

[WOMEN CRYING OUT] MOE: That's just to let you know who's gonna be boss around here. We've got to get rid of them. We've got to get rid of them. We'll get rid of them.

Listen, you got us to marry those Frankensteins, now get us a divorce. You have to have grounds for a divorce. Well, we made them take dancing lessons, wear fancy clothes, and even take baths 10 times a day, but still they don't complain. I've got it. Give a big party. They're bound to humiliate you. All your society friends can testify for you. Divorce will be a cinch. [CROWD CHATTERING] I haven't looked this pretty since I was a baby. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Come on, let's check in.

[CRIES OUT] Wouldn't you like to sit there? It's much more comfortable. Ain't she "hospital." That's where I'll put you if you don't be quiet. Go on. Say, Jasper, how's your tapeworm? Fine. It took the blue ribbon at Madison Square Garden. Fancy that. You fancy that. In former years, we traveled incognito, then by freight. Now we just thumb it. But of all the rides I've taken, I like best-- [GASPING] You clumsy oaf. You tripped him. He certainly did not. The butler did it deliberately. I did not, sir. He did it. Thank you. But you started it. As a rule, parties bore me, but I know I'm going to get a bang out of this one. [BOTH GASP] Oh, senator, I am so sorry. [SCREAMS] You missed me. Oh, yeah? [LAUGHING] Rachel, wait, please. Who did it? Who threw that? He did. Oh, you did, huh? Stop it. Do you hear me? [SCREAMS] And there we were, in mud up to here. Oh. Oh. Mm. Oh. SENATOR: Who threw that? Oh, who did this?. I'll find out. What's the idea? Who interfered with my romance? Why you-- Gentlemen, please. Please. Oh. We strive to please. Stop, stop. This has gone far enough. Love thy neighbor. [LAUGHTER] Why, you-- But I raised my rifle and fired. Naturally, the, uh-- The lions halted. So I turned to my right, and there, coming toward me, was a-- Another lion. But did it scare me? Not a bit. Old soldier like I am. Then I turned to come face to face with-- Another lion. Just at that moment, That very moment I heard a roar to my left. The lion that I thought I had killed was only wounded. But you understand exactly what I'm talking about. Well, at that time-- Now, there I was, one lion here, one lion there, nothing but my trusty knife and my bare fist, but there I was, about to-- Oh, me. Never have I been through such a lion fight. Somebody give me a pie. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Ha-ha-ha-ha. Funny, isn't it? Yeah. You're that cutie-pie. MOE: Why, you-- Where is he? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Mm. Mm. Nyuh-uh-uh-uh. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. MOE: Why, you-- Where is he? Who threw that pie? Shut up, you, or I'll-- [LARRY CRIES OUT] Why, you dirty tramps. You've disgraced your wives and their guests. Now, get out. I'll have your marriage annulled at once. Oh, yeah? Your little scheme-- It worked beautifully. [♪]
