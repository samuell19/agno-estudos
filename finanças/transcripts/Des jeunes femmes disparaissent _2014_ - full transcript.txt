Tuesday, April 2nd. The day after Easter weekend. The tenants of a housing project in Montreuil, bothered by the stench coming from a neighbor across the landing, alert the concierge. The bodies of two brutally mutilated young women are discovered. No motive, no clue. No conclusive DNA sample. The police have yet to consider that this could be the work of a serial killer and concludes that this is the work of a madman. Beloved woman, Open yourself to the one coming towards you. Beloved woman, Accept these caresses. When the evening comes, may the twilight cradle us. The beloved young woman found herself lost for a long while in the sky in which she was immersed for the first time; where, in ecstasy, she had lost all sense of her body, of time and space, and of the earth, that she would have preferred never to come back to. You never had an orgasm before? Did you have a lot of lovers? I've made love often. - And with your boyfriend? - It's nothing. Sometimes, not even that. Yet, Il'll go back to him in a few minutes. Why? The advantage with him is that I live high and free of charge. And in return, I agreed to make love to him. I know, you'll think of me as a whore. But he's so fond of me that he gives in to all my demands. And he's so weak with me that sometimes I come to despise him. But he loves me. He loves me madly. Because of that, sometimes he's able to move me. He always say he could never live without me. Neither could I. Do you care about him? I did, a little. Since I met you, not at all. You know, if he's supporting you I can do the same. I think I won't be able to stand your absence. One only dies of love in cinema. Please stay with me. As you can see, there's plenty of room in this apartment. That's true. - How did you get the place? - It doesn't matter If you're leaving now, I'll suffer like a damned soul. I'm not leaving for good. - And I'll come back as often as I can. - Everyday? Everyday? Yes, probably. And you'll spend the night? That will be more difficult but sometimes, I'll make something up. To leave you, even for a few hours, will be heartbreaking. Stay here then. Answer me. Why are you so eager to leave? It hurts me as much as it hurts you. But I'm scared of François' reaction. - Your boyfriend? He's so jealous that if I leave him suddenly he won't hesitate to come here, to hit you and kill you. We'll barricade ourselves. We'll call the cops. You don't know how he is. What will we live off? We'll live on love alone? Don't worry about that. My father is always giving me money. Maybe but now I love you and I don't want you to support me. Maybe for a while, until I find a job. But I'll pay you back very quickly. - No. I want you all for myself. Close to me. All the time. - You're really leaving? - I told you. I'll come back as soon as possible. I promise. You gave me a pleasure, a joy I could not imagine, even in dreams. - Stay then. Impossible. So soon? I'll call you as soon as I can. - When? - In a hour at the most. Parisians, don't go out without your umbrella today. Indeed, our nice anticyclone has left us for eastern Europe and heavy rain as well as storms are to be expected notwithstanding a few short-lived sunny spells. No, Mom. No, she snuck out after quite a violent fight. It happened three days ago. She still hasn't come back. I'm afraid she'll never come back and this thought is terrorizing me. Of course I didn't hit her! You know very well I couldn't hurt a fly. She, on the other hand... She tried. She says I'm keeping her captive in a gilded cage. She claims her life with me has turned into a nightmare. I am in agony, Mom. I don't know how all of this will end if she doesn't come back to me. Yes. I never feel like she's really here. I can see she doesn't love me. She always recoils a little when I touch her. And evidently when we make love, she gets bored so... I get bored too. But when she's not here, I hurt. That's when I realize how much I care about her. Yes, Mom. I treat her like a princess therefore she looks down on me. Yes Mom, you're right. I'm a schmuck. I'm her doormat. But the worst about all of this is that I'm clearly aware of it. But between my life without her and suffering, I prefer suffering. And between her being gone for good and death, I prefer death. I have made my decision, Mom. I'll go get her. She's at her friend Pauline's. No, I'm going alone. Don't worry, I'll find a way to get in. I'll give them a good thrashing. Yes, to them both! Time to put an end to this whole thing. Pauline? Pauline? Pauline? Pauline? Open up! Chloé, open up! Chloé? The two maniacs kept on killing in the following weeks. They were eventually spotted and identified. Thanks to surveillance cameras, they were arrested. They were locked up. However, after many psychiatric assessments, they were declared criminally insane, and they were sentenced to life in two specialized psychiatric facilities. This decision caused an outcry in the public opinion but with time, the case was forgotten whereas the two killers, slowly and meticulously, were preparing their escape. Subtitles by: DavidThewlis
