You'll just know. The guy was crazy. He woke me up at five, six and seven in the morning. I would lick and suck him. He grabbed my head. What's the sick bastard who does that? You know what? His sperm tasted blood. I could not sleep with that nasty taste in the mouth. I was completely gone. Two flarror whiskey and God knows how many lines toffee. You give up too easily. That's your problem. - That's what they pay for. - You're too kind. Then they pray always for more. I sell dreams. I draw on someone buttery song so that he relaxes. I take his flabby old hand and get him to dance. You should have seen when he pressed his shitty zigenarfejs against my balls. Give it here. - He said: "You're so cool, Hugo". - Hugo? Yes, deadhead. Not a fan I show him my ID. Do you get it? One should not be in a hurry. You should take it easy and slowly. Now and then caresses it to him like this. Idiot hardly knew his leg, and I got him to run faster and faster. Beware. - He did not ask anything else? - Yes, of course. I followed the music. Stop it! Stop that. Pardon... It is quiet. I've been through worse. I smell weird? Maybe the smell is still there. No, you smell like a freshly washed baby. Are you okay? Last night was not like to comply with some men at weddings. Do not worry. - Now we buy some liquor. - Sure. I'll just put on pants. What the fuck are you looking at? Stand up. Can you play when you empty your pockets and smile? It called lyckoskatt. Empty pockets and stop resisting. Stop it! Empty pockets. - Home and grinning, it's the right attitude! - I put you there on the web, your shit. Check the ad: "One night with erotic massage.

You have such nice lashes. I want to put me on them and never wake up. See what I mean? Are you afraid of my run-down body? Not so excited, huh? You know what my husband said, just before he died? He said: "We leave all of a shoe in someone else's refrigerator. "That was all. - I do not get it. - Neither do I. You get to choose significance. That is the advantage of madmen. Madame ...
