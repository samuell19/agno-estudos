You'll just know. The guy was crazy. He woke me up at five, six and seven in the morning. I would lick and suck him. He grabbed my head. What's the sick bastard who does that? You know what? His sperm tasted blood. I could not sleep with that nasty taste in the mouth. I was completely gone. Two flarror whiskey and God knows how many lines toffee. You give up too easily. That's your problem. - That's what they pay for. - You're too kind. Then they pray always for more. I sell dreams. I draw on someone buttery song so that he relaxes.
