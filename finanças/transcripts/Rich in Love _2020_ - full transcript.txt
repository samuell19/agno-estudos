NETFLIX PRESENTS [man] Tomato sauce runs in the veins of the Trancoso family. Generation after generation, we've perfected our techniques to create this premium tomato. Irrigation is automatic, enriched with liquid fertilizer. Our tomatoes are treated like our children: balanced diets, only the best schools, and a personal trainer. Therefore, they can be worth eight times the price of regular tomatoes. Now I'm going to show you a preview of the campaign my son, Teto, has been working on. It's a campaign for our new tomato sauce which brings together tradition, innovation, and, most importantly, love. Teto!

No, but if we start early at the hospital, we'll be done before the bus leaves. Can't we skip one day? Just one! You know I would in a heartbeat, but I can't skip any more days. I picked the worst people as bridesmaids for my wedding. That's easy for you to say when you're set in life. Right, sweetie? True. Plus this internship is my chance to get a residency at the hospital. Paula, your residency is guaranteed. - If it's up to Dr. Victor... - What about Dr. Victor?

You need to grow up, Teto. But I'm glad to see you up before noon. What did you expect with that helicopter flying overhead? While you were asleep, I went to Rio for a meeting and came back. And now I have to go to the factory. - I want to talk about your birthday. - Okay. Cool. - Meet me at Trancoso at five? - I'll check my schedule. I'll check on you later, okay - [Paula] Bye. - [patient] Bye. Paula, as usual, excellent case history. Thank you, doctor. I have a surgery now. Do you want to scrub in? - We have to go, don't we, Paula? - Next time, doctor. - For sure. - No, no. I'd love to, but we have a previous engagement. I just thought you really wanted this job, - but... - But I do! I do want it. I really do want it. I'll stay. Good. I'll be in the OR. - Sorry. There was nothing I could do. - No problem. - You guys are the worst, period. - Sweetie! Don't worry. [heart rate monitor beeping] Paula... I'm glad you stayed. - Of course, doctor. - Victor. - You can call me Victor. - Victor. - Okay. - Okay. No, I'm very grateful for the opportunities you give me. You know why, right? Because of my case histories? Because you're very special to me... Paula. [woman] Here, sir. It's just two. Girlfriend, you came! [squeals] What about the surgery? Here you go.

[Teto] Hey, hey, hey! Come over here. - [man] What's up? - [Teto] Where were you? I had class. - Let's do something. - No can do. I have to study. Study what, man? Let's do something. Let's have fun!

Monique is a junior executive here at Trancoso. I want you to pay close attention to everything she says and does. So, Teto, do you know what you want to do yet? Not yet. How did you decide you wanted this... - this junior thing you do? - I didn't really have a choice. Necessity makes you grab every opportunity you get. I also studied hard. Back in Rio, my school referred me to Trancoso's trainee program. Out of ten trainees, they picked me for an assistant position. Congratulations. Last year, I was transferred here and promoted as a junior... And now I have to babysit too. Monica. Monique. Have we ever hooked up? What? Because it seems you hold a grudge against me. Why? Like all your ex-girlfriends? [Igor laughs] Really, why are you picking on me? Your dad wants me to teach you how I got here. It wasn't with everyone praising the ground I walk on. Monique. Look, I really admire your story, and I appreciate your effort. - But I can't deal with this now. - You can't deal with it? I'm celebrating my birthday in a suite at the Tomato Festival, and there's a lot to do, a lot of people to invite. It's a real headache. But if you're free, stop by, okay?

So many people going hungry, and the guy wastes all this food on a tomato fight? It's absurd! I think this bachelorette party is over. Shall we? - Are you the bride? - No. I'm a bridesmaid. Katia's the one getting married. This Saturday. I have family here, so we came for a visit. - Is your wedding in town? - At the Municipal Theater in Rio. - It's another level, man. - [Katia] Respect me, my love! My cousin just got here. I have to meet her at the door. Me too. I don't want to be a third wheel. - [Paula] Me too. - Argh! Are you okay? I'm a little dizzy. I'll meet up with you guys. - Definitely, girl! - Okay. - Come on over in a little bit! - Yeah. Does it feel better? It still hurts. - Where can we get it rinsed off? - There's water inside here. - [Paula] Wow! What is this place? - [Teto] The greenhouse. There's the water. - Lift your face to stop the bleeding. - But it hurts bad. - It's fine now... Lift! - Okay. - Careful. - Does it hurt? - Just a little. - The bleeding's almost stopped. I don't think it's serious, but... if I were you, I'd go home. - Can someone drive you home? - No, it's okay. I live here. - Here. - Yeah. - Here at the Trancoso farm? - Yeah. Oh, my God. You know these people? My dad is the farm's... caretaker. - So I live here. - I see. - Okay, got it. - Yeah. I want to go to college in Rio. This town's become too small for me. - You'll like Rio. - I think so too. New people, right? Right. I feel like I'm missing a lot by staying here. [soft instrumental music plays] You're all good now! [laughs] - [Paula] Great. - You're an excellent doctor. Thanks. I'm going to find my friends. Okay. Do you like riding horses? I don't know. I've never ridden. Why? Want to ride now? Now? What do you say? I'll show you all the animals. - I can't now. - No? Okay, then. I need to go find my friends. And you should rest. - Doctor's orders. - Okay, doctor. Tomorrow then? - [Teto] Tomorrow? - I'm going back to Rio tomorrow. - But nice meeting you. - You too. - Bye. - Thanks. You're welcome. I'll see you. Perhaps in Rio, right? [birds chirping] [car horn honking] [soft instrumental music playing] [car horn honking] [Teto] What is this? I can't believe it! Happy birthday, son. Consider it an additional benefit of your new job in our company. Well, Dad, I wanted to talk with you - about this whole working... - Teto! You're an adult now. I don't want my grown-up son acting like a teenager. I've given you a car, a job at the company... From now on, no more money or allowance. - The rest is up to you. - No, I do want the job at Trancoso, but not only because I'm your son. I want to earn it. - [Teto] Get it? - Okay. Hey. Let's talk a minute. I want to make you an offer. Thanks, Teto, but no betting for me. I need to get to class today. And I want to help you. It's a real offer. No advantages, no privileges. You need to understand that my dream is going to Rio. - And college is the only way to do that. - You were right. I'll miss you when you go. You're my brother, my friend. - You're right. - Relax. It'll be a while. I'm off to Rio and want you to come along. So it's up to you. - [Igor] You're going to Rio after a girl? - [Teto] She's different. [chuckles] Sure. She rejected you. She's a rare specimen. I confess I liked being treated like a regular person. It must've been a shock. So I signed up for the Trancoso trainee program in Rio. I want to be chosen without being identified. So what's the bet? You sign up too, but you use my name, and I use yours. - Dude... - No, listen! There's only one spot. We'll compete against each other. If you win, this car is yours. So? ["The Edge Is On The Sun" by Diego Fragoso et al. playing] - [valet] Good afternoon, Mr. Teto. - What's up, Zé?

Just leave. - No! - What? - The guy from the farm. - Right. - Yes, the guy from the farm. - Teto. - You remembered! Cool. - I did. - What a coincidence! - Totally. - You, here. - Yeah. - Totally. - I told you I was coming to Rio, - remember? - Yeah, I remember. So here I am. I left everything behind and chased my dream. - Really? - Yeah. Wow! Awesome! I admire your courage. Some things are worth the sacrifice. Like meeting you here.

Have you been to the beach since you got here? - No, not yet. - Really? So you've never seen the ocean? I can't believe it! That's so exciting! - I showed you the ocean? - Yeah. - How nice. - It's really exciting. I'm... - My heart is... - I can imagine it. - It's big, isn't it? - Indeed. We didn't have money to travel. So my dad would make me pick tomatoes during school vacations. Ever since I was little. Oh, my God! I'm sorry, but that's exploitation, - having a child work like this. - Yeah. It was tough. Sometimes all we had to eat were tomatoes. That's rough. But that's life. You know, if you want to be someone, you have to work for it. That's how it is. Tomorrow, for example, I'm starting the trainee program at Trancoso Rio to try and start working there. There's only one spot for grabs. We'll see, right? With your determination, I'm sure you'll get in. I have to go now. - Early day tomorrow. - Sorry. - I'm really sorry. - No, my bad because... It's okay. I'm graduating med school. I have to get a residency, so I have to focus. - You get it, right? - Sure. Bye. - Good morning. - Good morning. Didn't you say nobody would know you? No way! Are you kidding me? They canceled me already! Sweetheart, would you help me out here? Hey! Damn it! [Monique yelps] [Teto] Are you okay? - Do I look okay to you? - Are you hurt? No. Getting canned was much worse. - Were you fired? - Yeah. I just signed a release. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. But I'm glad to be back in Rio. I was sick of fresh air, country music, organic food... I never want to see a tomato again. Excuse me. We're living here in Rio too. We're in the Trancoso trainee program. I wanna start from the bottom just like you. - [scoffs] - If they pick me, of course. Get real, Teto. If they pick you? You think no one will know who you are? - See? - I'm unknown at the headquarters in Rio. But your name's still Teodoro Trancoso Neto. Excuse me. I have a resume to send out. We're prepared for that. - [man] Good morning - [all] Morning. Which one of you is Teodoro Trancoso? - It's you. - Right. That's me. Nice meeting you. Célio Porto. I'm the marketing director here. - Hello. - Can I call you Teto? Well... sure. Great, Teto. I'm sure a young man with your enterprising DNA will do very well here. - Welcome. - [woman] Good morning, everyone! Good morning, Célio. Gather round, people. I'm Alana, talent development consultant. I was hired by Trancoso to implement this trainee program. Are you excited? So let's get started. [Alana] Come on! The trainee program offers participants one month of experience here at Trancoso. Upon completion, you all get a certificate, but only one of you will be hired. Let's learn a little more about the company's raw material. Tomato is the vegetable I know most about. Tomato is a fruit. - What's your name? - Te... Igor. Igor. I hope you know more about coffee. Why? Yes? I want you to pay special attention to the president's son. - Teodoro? - Yes. He's the famous Teto. Paty de Alferes' own Don Juan. Don Juan? That kid? [Célio] His father put a stop to that, but the kid's always lived la vida loca! [both laugh] Okay. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him. [instrumental music plays] [groans] Teto, right? - Yeah. Hi. - I'm Alana. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Rough hands! From working out? I've never worked out. It's from riding horses. Oh, horses. But riding is exercise too. It's good for posture... - Excuse me. Your coffee. - [Alana] Thanks. [gags, yelps] Oh, my God, Igor! This is the worst coffee I've ever had! - Sorry, the machine was broken. I can... - I can brew you some, if you want. - Really? - Farm-style. Excuse me. Igor? Igor. Please print this out for tomorrow's presentation. How do I do this? [machine beeping, whirring] Hi, ma'am. I'm almost done. You can call me Alana. Sorry. - It smells great. - Yeah? Mmm! - Mm! Delicious. - Great! I've made a lot of coffee. I'm pretty impressed, Teto. You could've come here, in your dad's company, giving out orders. Instead, you decided to start from the bottom. My experience as a recruiter has shown me that admitting you have things to learn is the first step to becoming a good leader. [Alana] Congrats. [Igor] Thanks.

I have a hunch, but we should run a few tests to be sure. Isn't there any medication she can start taking? Well, I can't write prescriptions. I'm not a doctor yet. You aren't? An intern? You promised me a doctor! - She's about to graduate. - And I'm about to kill you. Look at my nose. Perfect, right? A guy punched me, and she fixed it. She's good. Listen, Teto. You don't know me, and you will not screw with me. - Is that clear? - That's not my intention. I want to make you an offer. If you help me, and I get the position at Trancoso... my car is yours. - That car? - Yes. Convertible, four-by-four, brand new. It's worth a year of your salary. [scoffs] That car's worth much more than that. But are you seriously going to give me your car - if I help you? - Yeah. Only if I get to be hired. Otherwise, I promised it to Igor. [Paula] Uh-huh. Right, perfect. - She'll be there tomorrow. - [whispers] You got it? Thank you so much! Take care. Bye. - [Monique] So? - You're all set. I scheduled your sister for an appointment and some exams - at the hospital tomorrow. - Thank you! I can't thank you enough, Paula. - Thanks. - No problem. Teto, I love your girlfriend. - Beautiful soul. - No. - No, we're just friends. - We're just getting to know each other. - We'll be dating in a couple of days. - [Paula] What? - The day after tomorrow. - He's such a joker! [Teto] Sorry about the hassle, okay? [Paula] Don't worry about it. You don't know how good it is to feel useful, you know? Reminds me why I want to be a doctor. Let me make it up to you. Go out with me. [both chuckle] You've got a lot of nerve, kid. I was serious when I said I didn't need any distractions. Look at me. Am I a distraction? I'm a serious guy. Look. - So? - Okay. - Okay. When I have a day off. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? No, kid. - Why not? [doorbell chiming] [Monique] Hi. Where's Teto? - [Monique] Teto! - [Igor] He's asleep. [Monique] Teto? Teto! [tuts] - Get up! - No, no, no. - [Teto] Stop it. - Don't be lazy! First lesson: if you don't have money or references, stay ahead of the game. While people are asleep, before problems arise, you have to have the solution. Is she helping you out? Yeah. You lose, cutie pie. I'm getting the car. Right? - Get up. Come on. - No, no. [uptempo instrumental music playing] - Hey. - Good morning. - Are you guys starting early? - No. Just me. Excuse me. - Here you go. - Thanks. One for you. Everyone please take good care of this manual. It's very important, so... - Where did you get that? - Igor printed it out. Alana... our marketing department changed strategy last night again. Igor? Who told you to print this out? - No one. I just thought... - No! Trainees shouldn't think! Shred all these pages, please. I'm sorry, Célio. Let me give you a hand. Teto, come join the group. You're missing important information. Come! If they're picking on you, you need an ally. How do I get one? This is our new tomato sauce. Management wants you to make suggestions for the ad campaign. It's a good opportunity if you want the job. Excuse me, Mr. Célio. Do you have a minute? - Sure. - [Teto] So... I was thinking of this marketing exercise we were just given, and also the ad campaign. And I'd like to take some samples home. Is that okay? - [Célio] Igor. - That's me. Igor, you want to take work home? - Catch! - Stop, kid. - What do I do with this? - I don't know. You've already stood out, so just think up a strategy - to impress people. - Speaking of impressing... I want to take Paula on a date. I want to impress her. I need your help. Mmm! I was thinking of taking her somewhere nice. But it can't be too expensive... because I told her my dad's the farm's caretaker. Are you kidding me? You get a great girl, and you lie to her? I should hit you, not help you. How will I know if someone likes me - or my money? - Blah, blah, blah. - Got it? - Okay, I'll help you. At least in Rio you can still have fun on a tight budget. First, do you know how to take a bus? Well... in theory, yeah. It's easy, right? ["Favela" by Alok & Ina Wroldsen playing] [Monique] Pay attention. When your stop is coming up, make sure you're near the door. Excuse me. Sorry. Driver, wait! Driver, hold on! [Teto] Jeez! Hey! Did you see that? Come with me. [Monique] And forget the playboy bars. There's only one place that will impress her. That's so cool. What is this place? - You've never been here? - No. - It's cool. - I love it. - Do you know any steps? - I know this one. - See? - What the hell is that? Country-style dancing. You dig? Never mind that. I mean funk dance steps. - Show me what you know. - Funk? [Brazilian funk music plays over speaker] You suck. You've never danced funk, have you? I'll teach you. - One. Two. - One... - [Monique] Three. Four. - Two... And one. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Come back on three. And four is the base. One. Two. Three. Four. That was awful! Four. And one. Two.

But it's always been the opposite. I think when you... depend on someone else, you nullify yourself, you know? You erase yourself. What is it? That made me think of my mom. She died two years ago. She lived for my dad. I wonder if she nullified herself. She probably had her own dreams. I think your mom would be proud to see you freeing yourself from your dad, from your past, and chasing your dreams. Would she? I know I am. [romantic music plays] Let's go to your place. No. - Okay then. - It's just that it's messy. It's a huge mess. You don’t have to be ashamed of your home. - Of anything. - Let's go to a motel. - Where? - A motel. Never mind. No... No, no, no. That was nuts. We'll go to my place. I'm calling a cab. - That was crazy. - We can just call it off. No, we don't have to. Relax. EMERGENCY! I NEED HELP! I'm requesting it.

[Teto] Thanks, man. Is this where you live? I'm crashing at my uncle's. - You got it, right? - Yes. Look, they're here. Let me go welcome them. Oh, this way... - Uncle. - Good evening, Mr. Teto. "Mister," uncle? You didn't have to get the door. It's my job. He's something. I'm Paula. Nice to meet you. How are you? Do you want the screwdriver? - Oh, the little room key. - Yeah, that key. - Hang on. Here you go. - Thanks, uncle. - Have a good shift. - [Francisco] Good night. - [Teto] See you later. - [Paula] Bye. Have fun, okay? [both laugh] Ignore him. - Look, this is temporary, okay? - It's okay, Teto. I know. I'll find a better place soon. Relax. Careful. Be careful. Don't be shocked, okay? [Paula] Okay. Come on, Teto... it's not that bad. It's horrible. Sorry. I'm so embarrassed! I shouldn't have brought you here. - It's perfect. - No, it isn't. - Really. - No. You're sleeping here tonight. [Paula] Oh, my God. - Is it heavy? - No. Wait, wait... Got it. [Teto] Careful. - [Paula] Yeah... - Much better. - [Paula] You were right. - You see? [soft romantic music playing] [Teto] What a strange feeling. What feeling? That I don't need anything else. [Alana] A fountain? - A tomato sauce fountain? - That's my idea. We'd put a fountain in every point of sale, such as malls, supermarkets, and so on. [chuckles] I'm sorry. But no. No, right? We're not rejecting any ideas at this point. I really like Teto's idea better. [Alana] Show them the Trancoso mascot. The Trancoso mascot is a character that represents a happy premium tomato. Yes. He's well-traveled, sophisticated, speaks many languages... - [Igor] He's premium. - [Alana] Premium. I also thought we could create shareable content to increase social media engagement. Perfect. That's the goal, Teto. We want people to promote the brand spontaneously. - Exactly. - But I like the fountain idea. It speaks to an adult market as well. Okay. So, if we like both ideas, let's put both Igor and Teto on it. Hi. How are you? Could I wait in here? I'm meeting someone who works here. Teto. - It's raining. - I couldn't help overhearing. - Are you meeting Teto? - Yeah. I'll take you to him. Come on in. Let her go through, please. - Is she clear? Great. - Thanks. - What's your name? - Paula. - Is it company business? - No. - I'm a friend of his. - Teto's famous "lady friends"! - What? - What? - What do you mean, "famous"? - No, I said... No! It's just what people say. He looks so well-behaved, - but those are the worst ones, right? - I don't get it. I'm kidding, silly! - It will be interes... What is it? - Duck! Duck! - [Paula] Thank you. - Paula's in there with Alana, bro! Shit will hit the fan. Is everything okay? - It's just that... - Well, Alana. That... That girl that just came in... I can't really deal with her right now. Right. - I shouldn't do this... - [Igor] Hm-mm. ...but I will help you. There's an emergency exit over there. Go, go, go... - Get down! - Get down! Sorry. [Alana] Go. Turn right. I'll be right there. Wait for me. Do what you have to do. I think I'll go home. Your friend is going to think I'm crazy! - This Paula's a crazy stalker. - I see. Paula! That Alana is crazy! - She's out to get me! - Why, Teto? She doesn't want me to get the job. She's protecting the president's son. That's why. Look at me. Come here. Do you trust me? - You owe me one. - [car alarm chirps] Now you have to take me to dinner at a nice restaurant. Well, Alana... Well what? Are you scared of me? Well... instead of taking you to a restaurant, - I could cook at home for you. - Get out of here! You cook too? Hm-mm. - I'm in. - Really? - Let's do it. - Okay. - Do you need help? - No, that's okay. - Thanks. - My pleasure. I hope you like it. - Spaghetti. - Taste it. It's my favorite recipe. - Tomato sauce, right? - Tomato sauce. With hot dogs. [Alana] Mm... I forgot the wine. I'll go get it. I'm not eating much. I'm on a diet. [Igor] That's fine. [dance music plays from stereo] I've got these two. "Chat-e-au Marga-ux" or "Cabernette Sauvig-non". Teto... you are so cute. Did you know that? Is this how you seduce girls? - What? - With this shyness. - To tell you the truth, I don't know. - You know. Sure you do. [sexy music playing] [both laugh] Now I want to see what you know. - Can I tell you something? - Shoot. - No. Never mind. - No, tell me. Now you have to tell me. I don't know. For a small-town... guy... a country kid... you're different than I expected. What did you expect? I expected... [cell phone chimes] - What's that? - It's my phone. Teto, it's Monique. Her sister is not well. - Let's go there now. - We'll stop by a drugstore. - [Teto] A little further, buddy. - [driver] It isn't safe at this hour. [Paula] It's an emergency. She's a doctor. Someone's sick in there. I'm sorry, but it's too risky for me. Risky for you? A woman is dying in there! Miss, I've turned off the meter. If you want, try a motorcycle taxi. - Come on, Paula. Let's go! - Unbelievable. Thanks. Teto? Teto?

It was good, but I think I still need some pointers. - That's cheating. - Getting pointers? - No, screwing our boss! - Come on, Teto!

Unfortunately, that's very hard to believe. - What's up? - Can I crash here? - What? - I can't stay at my dad's anymore. I don't want anything from him. If you don't, fine, but I want my car. Okay, you can stay, but you'll have to help with everything. Cleaning, cooking, and taking care of the baby. Got it? [instrumental music plays] Paula! Paula! - Stop. I want to talk to you. - No, Teto. Paula, please. Excuse me, man. You have to listen to me. Please just hear me out. Why should I, if all you've told me since the day we met were lies? I lied because I didn't know who I was. Paula, when you're rich, people lie to you. You can't distinguish real friends from those after your money. Right. You have to lie so that people tell you the truth? It's simple. If you want good friends, be a good friend. You want people to think you're a good guy, be one, - but you weren't! - Well, you see, I didn't know what I wanted. And now I do. I want the two of us, together. I'm going away. I signed up for a physician volunteer program in the Amazon. I'll be there for a while. Really? Really. Congratulations. Thanks. Good luck. It'll be cool. Teodoro, I think this was the best group of trainees we've ever had. - And Teto was the best candidate. - Teto? He's proactive. He's smart. He'll make a difference here. He's my pick for the job. [exhales] Célio, I've always respected you. So respect me and tell me the truth. I don't need ass-kissers. But I'm telling you the truth. Your son was excellent. Although there was another boy who was just as good. Better. Go ahead and say it. The whole concept for the campaign, for example, was his. We should hire them both. No, Célio. We are only hiring one person. You pick the best one. The best one, Célio. [Monique] Let's go! Get up! Come on! - No! - Come on. Let's go! Today's your day. Come on. CONGRATULATIONS, TRAINEES! Hi, cutie pie. Where are the keys to my car? [whispering] Champ! Champ! Champ! Hello. I'm so sorry, sir, but I need you to move to another seat. What? Yes, please. This seat is reserved for the company president. Alana, you two haven't been formally introduced. Teodoro Trancoso. - No. - [Célio] Alana was our coach for this trainee program. - No... But he isn't... - Shall we start the ceremony? Sure. Good evening. [audience] Good evening. I'd like to thank the illustrious presence... of Mr. Teodoro... and to congratulate this group of trainees. Before handing out the certificates, I'm going to call Mr. Célio, and he will announce which one of you was selected to be a junior executive. Célio, please. Junior executive? We have several outstanding candidates in this class, but unfortunately, only one position. And the job goes to... Teto. [Alana yelps excitedly] Come on up! [applause continues] What's wrong? Go. That's not me. It's you. Go on. [Célio] Here he comes! - What's going on? - Later. Igor? What's going on here, Célio? I'd like to thank you all for this opportunity. But I can't take the job... because I'm not Teto. Teto, come over here! That is Teto. [dramatic music playing] - And who gets the job? - Nobody. Exactly. This job should never have been offered. It was taken from someone who deserves it more than I do. I'm up here to apologize to you, Monique. And to all of you for the situation I've created. I'm sorry. [Monique] Excuse me. Excuse me. [Alana and Monique] Teto. That Teto. Leaving without talking to me? Was it this stupid little plan of yours - that cost me my job? - I didn't know. I didn't mean to take anybody's job. I didn't know you'd like me... Or rather, Teto. I couldn't care less about Teto. I've spent my entire life taking shit, being interrupted and underestimated by guys like Teto. I was much more interested in the sensitive, attentive guy with this beautiful smile than in a stupid status of an heir. So you're not upset I'm the caretaker's son? - The son of whom? - I don't have a cent to my name. - I live with my parents... - Just shut up before I change my mind. It was a bet. We lost, and Igor won. Only because everyone thought he was the boss's son! [Monique] So he doesn't deserve the car. Wait! I agree with you. - I don't want the car. - No, wait. Calm down. Don't do anything rash. Of course you want the car. - What is it? - Here, Teto. No returns. A bet is a bet. You know. Fine, but I want my car. Give me the key. - Fine. I don't need it. - No. This car is worth at least $60,000. - He wants it. He won the bet. - Take it. - [Alana] No. - [Monique] Thanks. Guys, how about if everyone keeps the car? You mean sell it and share the money? Among yourselves? No, not share it. Invest it. Invest in what, for God's sake? Something that will get us somewhere. ONE YEAR LATER [all] Surprise! CHEERS, TETO! Happy birthday, big boy. I've always believed in you, son. Me too! In both of you! - [Igor] Happy birthday, partner. - Thanks, guys. But you didn't have to, really. I agree, but what could I do? - The community insisted. - Right. What could you do? HAPPY BIRTHDAY - [Rose] Happy birthday. - [door buzzes] - [horse neighs] - [Teto chuckles] - There. Now everyone's here. - That's right. Hi. It's been quite a while. Right? How are you? I'm fine. And you? I had to come here. I was curious. I was in Roraima when I heard about your project. - I was very curious. - Want a tour? - Yeah. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Excuse me. - After you. - Your dad? - Yeah. He's one of my clients. Our clients, actually. The company is co-owned by Monique, myself, and Igor, who's in college. And his wife, Alana, works for us. - Hi. - Hi! Paula, right? Yes. One of the "famous" ones. [all laugh] - Shall I show you the project? - Excuse me. - Okay. - See ya. Every resident can earn extra income by growing premium tomatoes. It's all organic. Pretty cool. Wow! FRESH TETO - "Fresh Teto"? - I was against it. [soft instrumental music plays] Teto... I'm impressed. Paula, I'd like to thank you. I wouldn't be who I am today if I hadn't met you. Look at this. Look how pretty. - It's beautiful! Yeah! - Isn't it? It's ours. What are you doing? Sorry! Sorry! I waited a long time for that. Satisfied? Not yet.
