(lively music) - Ain't you even gonna stop and say hello? - Why? - We're your sons, that's why. - So. - Here, I kept her oiled for you, Pa. - You kept her oiled for me. That what you boys been doing for the past 12 years? Ha! (lively music) - We're not boys anymore, Pa. During that 12 years you were in prison, we were growing up, case you didn't notice. Me and Phoenix, we, we picked up work where we could and we stuck together just like you told us to. - And we took care of Slo. Had to keep a close watch on him. - I've been real good, Pa. - Couple of months ago, he near got strung up down in Shale City. - What's the matter with you, you fool? Don't you realize you're 33-year-old man and that you're, you're a Taggart? - 33-year-old idiot. (gentle music) - You know, I got a feeling that you boys have had something on your minds ever since you met me this morning. Well, whatever it is on your mind, why don't you spit it out? Say it straight, just like a man! - Straight out then, Pa? - Straight out, Gale. - We headed for that gold you got hid. - (scoffs) I've taken care of all three of ya since you was pups without any help. Haven't I always gotten you what you wanted? You never needed for nothing. - We're not talking about eating money here. - We've been waiting for 12 years, Pa. Waiting with no money. Waiting for you to get out. (tense music) - Come on, Slo. Let's get riding. - You know, Phoenix, 12 years ain't changed a damn thing. He's still the same O.B. Taggart. - And he still favors that half-wit brother of ours. (lively music) (somber music) - Clara, Taggart got out today and I can promise you one thing, I won't ever forget. 12 years ain't long enough to let forgiveness push all the bad thoughts out of my head. I will get even with him, Clara. You've got my word. (somber music) (lively music) (gentle music) (horse hoofs pounding) - [O.B.] Here we are, boys. Smiley's. - Consuela, (speaking in foreign language)! - Dang it's good, I'll tell ya that. (laughs) Here, come on, get over to that table. Smiley! Smiley, get your ass over here. You got customers just to come in. - [Smiley] O.B. Taggart? (Smiley laughs) I thought that was you. - Yeah! - Yeah, hot dang it. I recollect you come through here some years back, right? - [O.B.] About 12 years ago. - Yeah, and you stop me if I'm wrong, as I recollect you was in the company of a couple of federal marshals wasn't you? - You know where they was taking the old man, Smiley? To the federal prison. - Jack Parris. (tense music) - O.B. Taggart. - Federal prison? (Smiley chuckles) Well maybe so, but- - They was taking him to jail. That's where dogs like you belong. They shoulda strung you up after you let my sister die, O.B. - You oughta say hello to hear your nephew here. Slocum, say hello to your Uncle Jack. - He ain't nothing to me. - Got back to you drink, Jack. Even though you were Clara's brother, you can only stay healthy so long. - Old man, you got a lot more after you than the feds. My advice to you is just keep going. (tense music) (O.B. chuckles) (O.B. sniffs) - What's that I smell back there, Smiley? What you got cooking back in that pot? - [Smiley] Well, I got stuff. Never can tell when- - Why would you say stuff? That's not telling me what you got in the pot. - Well, I got tortillas. I got lizard steaks and ham hocks and stewed tomatoes, chili beans and cow brains. - Bring me that shit out here, we're hungry. We got growing boys. Right, boys? - Taggart, I want you to eat all you want. I think a man that's gonna die, he oughta have have what he wants. - It's your past, not mine. I don't want no trouble. (chickens cackling) What the hell did he do anyway? - Ah, he got my sister, mother of that whelp of his, fat with another child. (Jack sniffs) Oowee! He didn't learn his lesson the first time and he claims he robbed that gold to save her life. You know, medicine and all that. - Well, did he? - Hell no, just caused a lot more trouble. The gold, that's what he wanted. It was the goal. - Maybe that's why they's out there. Must've got wind of Piggy Benson's strike. - You never did say where was headed, Pa. - No, I didn't. You'll know soon enough. - We got a right to know. - You're a pushy son of a bitch! - Well, you oughta be the expert on bitches, God knows you've laid enough of 'em. - Blue, back off. - Ah, hell, Pa. I'm sorry I made you mad. Dammit, it seems like I'm always having to tell you I'm sorry for something. - I always wondered why them lawmen didn't get the gold back. - Well, when the Federal Marshals moved in on O.B., he told them that the bushwhackers had already been there and cleaned him out. - Prison don't kill a man's craving for gold. Mr. Parris, would you get to the door please? - Yes, sir. (cows mooing) - [Smiley] All right. - You know all the time you was in prison, we kept our faith that Pa's got that gold stashed away somewhere. We planned on living a whole lot better once you got out. - He done right by us. He gonna get us a big spread, ain't you, Pa? - Now, you just be quiet, Slocum. - My Pa, O.B. Taggart, law-abiding sodbuster. Dear God, I can see it now. (he gasps) - Gale. - There you are Mr. Taggart, my special blue plate here, hot on the trail. There you go, boys. It's really hot, now. Watch it. Consuela, don't touch the food! (chuckles) They're good to look at and to poke. But you don't want 'em touching your food. You know what I mean? Consuela, I told you! (she whimpers) Not to touch the food! - No! (dish clatters) You hurt her! - Hey now, Smiley, that's my boy, Slocum. He gets mad when somebody treats a girl bad, tries to hurt her. You understand me, Smiley? - Yes, sir, Mr. Taggart. - [Gale] Consuela. - [Consuela] Si. (Gale speaking in foreign language) - You've got 10 minutes to fill your belly and get, Taggart. Can't you hear what I said, old man? Or are you so old, you've lost your hearing? (silverware clinking) My sister's probably better off dead than being with you, you slimy little pig. (glass clatters) (dramatic music) And you, you moron, you're a blight on my sister's memory. - Slo, he just called you a moron. Are you gonna take that? - [Phoenix] I wouldn't. (Slocum gasp) - [Slocum] Oh! (Slocum moans) - [Gale] Cut him, Slo. (bottle shatters) (Slo moaning) (dramatic music) (Jack groans) - You're gonna die for this. (Slocum panting) - [Smiley] Boy you're, you're bleeding bad. (tense music) (Jack moaning) - [Smiley] Those bad boys, Mr. Parris. Bad boys. - Why don't we just kill the son of a bitch and get the hell outta here? - [O.B.] Yeah, he got what he was asking for. Put that shit down. Get up and let's get out of here. - [Gale] Back me up, Speed. - [Phoenix] Got it covered. (cow mooing) - Hey boys, you and O.B. better put some distance between here and there. Jack Parris just died right there in my kitchen. - Died? - Blood was spurting out like you wouldn't believe. That bottle musta cut one of them big veins there. He just slipped away. Bled to death, I guess. O.B., hey, look now, don't worry about paying for that food, 'cause it's just- - Ah, nevermind about the food, Smiley. I want you to remember one thing, it was self defense, right? (cattle lowing) - Yes, sir, it was, it was self-defense. - Yeah and don't you forget it. - Pa, being he's Slo's uncle, least we can do is give the man a decent burial. - Well, whoa, well now you know that, that won't do, 'cause I've gotta send Consuela over to get the Sheriff. So the Sheriff can see him and I'll be able to explain exactly how it happened. Self-defense, like your daddy said. Self-defense. (donkey braying) (man singing) - Dear Lord, what is that? - [Phoenix] It looks like a desert rat to me. - All right, boys, get your horses, get saddled up and let's get outta here. Smiley, I'm leaving it up to you. You see that Jack Parris gets a decent burial. - [Smiley] Yes, sir, that I will. (Piggy chuckles) - I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Parris. I'd have been an hour earlier, but I had to stop off at the Assay Office and pick up my gold dust. - Piggy, Piggy, Piggy. - Hey, hey, you know Judge Lucas said that Mr. Parris here, would pay me cash for my claim. It's a real a real strike, Mr. Parris. You know 20 years I been up there in them there hills searching for gold, well I finally found it. (he chuckles) It's good for what ails you, too. - Piggy, Piggy, Piggy. - Yeah, yeah. - That there. - Uh-huh. - That there ain't Mr. Parris. - Huh? - That there is Mr. O.B. Taggart. Them boys, they're his sons. (tense music) (Gale spits) (Piggy chuckles) - It looks like you come a long way on the trail. You must be thirsty. Maybe you oughta get yourself a swig of something. Wet those pipes of yours, huh? Come on, boys. (gentle music) - Excuse me. Excuse me. I had a long day today and I'm kinda tuckered out. I can't remember much. As a matter of fact, I, I don't even know whether I have just one vein in my claim or I gotta go back and, and-and, seek some more. - Yeah, they're gone now, Mr. Parris. For a minute there, I thought they's gonna come back here and get you and bury you for real. - Bastards, didn't leave me much face. - Let me see what you got. Oh, man, you got a real bleeder there. I better send Consuela to get the Widow Pines. She's good at that, stitching up. - As long as I can get fixed up soon enough to even up the score. - Now, don't you go looking for no more trouble. (mule braying) (lively music) (horse hooves pounding) - Back, back, get, Scary. Get, Scary, go! (donkey brays) Go! (tense music) (donkey braying) (tense music) (Piggy chuckles) - Hi, fellas. I've been digging 30 years. I haven't had much luck. (Piggy moans) Kept hoping I'd strike it and I'd raise a family. Made a lauder out of me, hoping. (chuckles) - Hey, Piggy. What you doing? Rooting in the mud? Huh, what you doing? - Hey, you want it? It's yourn. Don't mean nothing to me anyhow. I'll just keep going on digging. - Shut your mouth, Piggy. Throw me that bag. - Hey, you wanna be my partners? There's enough gold in that mine to make us all rich. Hey, we can buy big cigars and buy some fancy women. You wanna be my partners? - I got me enough partners. I got three sons. Come on, Slo. - Hey, why do you gotta get from me anyhow? I never done you no harm. - [Phoenix] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. - What are you doing? - [Phoenix] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. (trigger clicks) (gunshot booms) He leadeth me beside the still waters. (gunshot booms) He restoreth my soul. (gun cylinder clicks) (wagon creaking) (water splashing) - You're coming along nicely, Mr. Parris. - You telling me I'm all healed up, only three days? - Well, you will be carrying some scars, but then don't we all? - Hey, little brother. Speed, come here, come here. - Yeah. - You hungry? - Ain't had a bite all day. I'll take a leg. (gunshot booms) - What the hell did you do that for? - Didn't want him to die of old age. (Gale chuckles) - You know I think it's about time, boys, that I remind you of something I told you when you were just kids. There are two kinds of killings. One is killing for killing. The other's killing for purpose. Now, killing for a purpose is nothing to be ashamed of. Killing for killing, that's not good. The reason I told you that, I wanna remind you about, well, that little miner, Piggy. Nobody had to kill him. - Don't much matter now, he's gone to a better place. - Uh-huh, I guess maybe. 12 years ago, I might've done the same thing. But doing those long, hard 12 years I had to do, I got to thinking a lot. And I thought about the fact that, well, there's room for everybody in this world. Hear me? Room for everybody. - Well, it's good to have some gold, Pa. People just look at you different when you got some gold. - You and that gold. Come on, Slo, we'll turn in. - Pa, what about the rabbit? - Uh, I'm tireder, than I was hungry. Don't get burned, boys. - He ain't fooling me, Phoenix. - Um, could be he means to settle down to ranching. - Ranching is the last thing on that old man's mind. It oughta be the last thing on our mind. We oughta keep thinking about that gold. - You know it's possible that after we robbed that train, somebody did take that gold from him. The Bible says- - Oh, Phoenix, you don't believe that bullshit. That old man knows exactly where that gold is. - What I was gonna say is the Bible says that good things come to them that are patient, have a little faith. - Faith, (scoffs) I swear to God ever since you got religion, I'm having a hell of a hard time trusting you. (determined music) (flames crackling) (tense music) (chickens clucking) - Luanne. - Yes, sir. - Company. (tense music) - Now, you stay right here and watch them and that farmer, too. I'll go up there and see if he's friendly. - I'll do it. - Evening, friend. I don't mean you no harm now. - You a stranger in these parts? - Yes, sir, I am. My name's Gale Taggart. - What about that other one and them down there? - Well, this is my brother here and the other two, that's my Pa and my other brother. (cows mooing) (Slocum imitates cows mooing) He likes cows. - Well, sir, I'm a named, Sam Lawrence, and this here's my wife. - Ma'am. - My daughter, Jenny? This is my daughter here. What is it we can do for you? - Well, we're gonna be riding around this valley for a few days trying to find ourselves a little place so we can settle down. We might be neighbors. - Well, yes. Well, yes, sir. All right, yes, sir. Well, you come on in. Well, I tell you, I think you might just wanna stop, rest up here, get yourself something to eat. You can use the bunk house. It's on the other side of the corral. We don't have any help any more. So you just have that place all to yourselves. - Well, if we're not intruding on anybody. - No, no. We'd be happy for the company. Just go on now, wash yourself up. You know, when you want to and when the spirit moves you, come on up to the house and them other ones, too. - Much obliged, Mr. Lawrence. - My momma's cooking chicken for dinner tonight. - Yeah, and there's plenty of it. You're mighty welcome to it, sir. - That sounds mighty good. We appreciate it. Speed, I'll meet you down at the bunkhouse. - Come on, Jenny, get them beans started. (determined music) (Slocum snorting) Well, it sure feels mighty strange to have three handsome men at my dinner table. Oh, four, excuse me, Sam. (others chuckle) - You know, if our pa wasn't so tired, he'd be here with us. He's not as young as he used to be and he just had to get a little rest. - Does my heart good to see three sons so devoted to their father. Jenny, I want you to take a lesson from these boys. - If you don't mind me saying, you men seem a little old to be hanging around your pa. How come you don't have misses and kids of your own? - Ooh, we waiting for, ah, he been in a- - A religious, what was it? - Pilgrimage. - Pilgrimage, religious pilgrimage. You see, Mr. Lawrence, our father's a, a godly man. - Amen. - Well, I'd say he was a very lucky man as well to have three such sons as yourselves. - And he raised us all by hisself, too. - Did he? Oh, then your mama's- - Could I milk your cows? - We milk the goat. Cows are for slaughtering and eating. - Oh, no, that ain't right. (table rumbles) - It's okay. They don't feel anything. - Slo, lets go. - Jenny dear, get some food for the boys to take to Mr. Taggart and clear the dishes. It's nearly your bedtime, darling. Jenny's got some chores to do early in the morning. - [Gale] Slo. - We better get some rest, boys. - She's sure got pretty hair, don't she, Slo? - Uh, before you men leave, I just wanna say that I enjoy the company of strangers. - I'll go along with that, Mr. Lawrence. It was mighty good for us to be here, too. Especially, since Miss Luanne, Miss Lawrence, is such a good cook. Pardon me, ma'am, for seeming so familiar. - Well that's all right, Mr. Taggart. I rather like being called by my given name. - My brothers and I thank you and may the good Lord look kindly on you till the break of day. - Amen to that. - Thank you. (gentle music) - [Gale] Go on, Slo. Much obliged. - Must be nice to come from a Christian family like that. How long have your folks been married? - Oh, about 15 years now. - 15 years. - All them boys, that was nice, huh, Mrs. Lawrence? - Not now, Sam. Let's wait till I finish the dishes first. Sweet face. (he chuckles) (gentle music) - I love nights like this. The stars are so bright. - Yeah, it's mighty pretty out here. Ain't it, Slo? - Goodnight, ma'am. - Goodnight. - Why didn't you give her a goodnight kiss? It'll held you over till morning. Go on, catch up to her. It'll be all right. (gentle music) - [Slocum] Here's your food, Pa. Are you cold? - (chuckles) I can't remember when I was ever warm. - They kill cows, Pa. - I know, son, but they, they've been killing 'em for a long time. - Slo, you are so lucky. Your pa really loves ya. - And you're lucky I'm so tired I don't get up and tell you where to go and how to get there. Now, get your ass in bed, Gale. - Can I stay here? - Yeah, you can stay here for a while. (sighs) Once upon a time. - Phoenix, you can pray later. (tense music) - [O.B.] Cow jumped over. - You know the more trouble Slo gets to be, the sooner Pa is gonna go after that gold he's got hid. (tense music) Go on back to your praying. Say one for me, little brother. God knows I need it. (Jenny humming) (rooster crowing) (pail clanging) (chickens clucking) (O.B. snoring) (Jenny humming) Slo, Slo. (Slo gasps) - Huh? - Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh, sh-sh-sh. It's near sunup and you know when we get that little spread of ours, you're gonna be getting up about this same time every morning to the feed the chickens and milk the cow maybe, like Jenny's doing now. Not me, I like to sleep a little bit longer. I kinda feel sorry for the pretty little thing having to get up out of her nice, warm bed at the crack of dawn to go down to that old cold barn just to milk that cow. Go on, Slo. (O.B. snoring) (gentle music) (door banging) (gentle music) (goat bleating) (milk splatting) - Morning. - What is your cow's name. - It's not a cow. It's a goat. Her name's Goatee. When, when my Pa gets a barn, I'm gonna do the milking. - You're up early, Mr. Taggart. - Mr. Taggart, that's my Pa. You can call me Slo. - You know how to milk? (goat bleating) - You just squeeze, like that. Don't you? - Like this. It's really easy. (milk splashing) Come here, you try. (Jenny laughs) (Slocum yells) - What'd you, what'd you do that for? - Come here, you big baby. You try. - Oh, you'll let me? (Slo sniffs) - Don't! Slo, I think you should go. - [Slocum] Smells good. - Don't touch me. I'm gonna tell my Pa. - No. No! Jenny, please, no! - [Jenny] Pa! You're hurting me. (Slocum moans) Pa! Pa, help! He hurt me. (Slocum crying) Pa! Pa, come quick. - [Slocum] Pa! (tense music) (Slocum moaning) Oh, oh, Pa! (Slocum crying) - Where have you been, huh? What are you doing outside? What are you doing outside? Get over there. Ah, and don't you dare lie to me! - Pa, that farmer's coming. He's got a shotgun with him. - I, I didn't hurt, Jenny. - Jenny? - I just smelt her and told her she smelled good. - You were touching that Jenny girl? Oh, many times have I told you don't touch any children. God, only knows somebody see you, they're not gonna realize that you're nothing but a child yourself. - Pa, save it! He's here. (intense music) - Taggart! You hear me? One of them boys of yours tried to have his way with my little Jenny. Now, you send him out here. I'm gonna take him over to the county seat, 'cause we got some law over there. - You're ruining the whole thing for all of us, little brother. I'm a good mind to blow what's left of your brain up against that wall. - You touch him, Gale, and I'll blow your eyes right out of the socket. Uncock that gun! - Taggart! Come on out! You ain't gonna be able to hole up in there. Just send out that boy! You know the one I mean. - There's three of us. We can kill him. - Yeah, we could kill him all right, Phoenix. But there'll be no killing here. Put up your guns, I'm going out and talk to the man. - You mean you're gonna go out there and talk to that fellow without carrying any iron with you? - You know, Gale, sometimes I think I have to wonder about you more than I do this, this Slocum. Shut your damn mouth. Lawrence. (horse neighing) Mr. Lawrence? - Sam Lawrence. Mr. Taggart? - Mr. Lawrence you, you look like you've got trouble on your mind. - Yes, sir, I believe you can say I do. - It's about Slo it- - I'm in no mind for no small talk. - I'm not trying to small talk ya. It wasn't his fault. It was mine. - Them boys had a bad way of repaying my hospitality, now didn't they? - Would you mind not pointing that thing at me? I'm an older, I'm an older man. (horse neighing) - Yes, sir. Right, yes sir. - What's your first name? - Sam, sir. - May I call you by your first name? - Yes, sir. - Sam, look, you and me we're both, we're both fathers. So I want you to understand that Slo, well, he was never been more than six years old all his life. - Yes sir, but you know my little girl, Jenny, she's just little girl. Now that boy of yours, I don't care what age he is, but he's dangerous. - I gotta explain it. I seeded a woman that wasn't too right in her head. Well, that made him not too right in his head. - Yes sir. I can see you've had a cross to bear. - Yes, Mr. Lawrence, I've had, I've had a big cross to bear. Now, I think I just wanna stop running. (gentle music) I, uh, think I'd like to find a place to settle down. Maybe, maybe around here. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir, now you're doing some talking. There's land a plenty here. Just everywhere you look. Now see this ridge right here? - [O.B.] Yeah. - Can't you just see a row of houses, just sitting right up there on that ridge? And then, here hold this. You see, right down and in that draw? Right down there, the water is real good. (trigger clicks) Now I can see a meat packing plant- - Now shut up your big fat mouth! - Pa, you gotta be one of the smartest hombres this side of the Rockies. - You know what, Pa? We can shoot him right now. - Gale, get that gun out of Mr. Lawrence's face. Mr. Lawrence here was nice enough to take us in. Here, Phoenix, take that while I go in and do some talking to Slo. - Pa? - Yeah? - You know Gale might be right. Slo does cause us a lot of problems. - Mr. Lawrence, you get your big fat ass up there in that wagon. Stay there! Pa's getting soft. - My patience is running thin. - What's he doing to him in there? - Our Pa believes that right and wrong begins at home. He's in there laying it to old Slocum for trying to get some milk from your pretty little daughter, Jenny. (Gale chuckles) - Strikes you as funny does it? - Yeah. - It does, huh? Let me tell you boys something. Let me tell ya, someday you're gonna have children of your own. You're gonna settle down and you're gonna have- - Didn't I tell you to keep your big ass up there in that wagon? - Gale, you and Phoenix get saddled up. Mr. Lawrence, we wanna thank you very much for your hospitality. Hope we didn't cause you any inconvenience and don't go looking for any trouble. We Taggarts are bad enemies, huh. For God's sake, put your arms down, we can smell you in the back of the house. (tack jingling) - Mr. Lawrence. You be sure and tell Miss Luanne I said bye-bye now. - Your gun's over by the barn, Mr. Lawrence. Have a nice day. (lively music) - [Luanne] Jenny! Jenny! - Papa. - Jenny. Sam? Sam, honey, are you okay? - Yes. - Are you good, hon? - Yes. I think that man is the saddest that I ever ran into. (lively music) (bird screeching) (determined music) (horse neighing) (chickens clucking) - Pa! Pa, a stranger's coming! Stranger's coming, Papa! - Afternoon. Oop, I don't, I don't mean no harm to you folks. - [Sam] State your business, stranger. - Well, my name's Jack Parris. I buy up mining claims. - Mining claims, huh. - Lot of folks come by your place here all the time? - No, not much. - Well, if a stranger come by, say maybe three or four of 'em, you think you'd notice? - More than likely. - Mr. Taggart and his sons, Papa. - You mean Taggart? - Nobody asked you nothing, Jenny. Go on up to the house. Go on. - Well now, the family named Taggart, that's who I'm looking for. - They friends of yours? - The Taggarts, they ain't got no friends. - Well what's your business with them then? - Well, let's just say they give me something. I wanna give them something in return. - Mister, I ain't looking to do no favors for them Taggarts. - Well, here, let me show you what they did for me. - Oh, God. Well, they may have left some scars on that little girl of mine, too. They rode out of here yesterday morning bout daybreak. - Where do you think they might be resting up? - Well sir, that's not a place I've ever been but that one boy of his, about 40 miles northwest, a place called Molly's. - The scar on that little girl of yours'll heal up. She's still young. (lively music) (owl screeching) (horse hooves pounding) (horse neighing) - [O.B.] Oh, we're gonna do a little socializing with an old friend of mine, Molly Plantain. All right! (horses neighing) Quiet out there, you horses! Shut up! - Molly Plantain? You mean Molly Plenty? - Well, (woman giggling) she's got a house here that, uh, will give anybody a lot of pleasure and we're going in and get some. (O.B. laughs) - I'm not going in. - You're not? - No, let me talk to you for a minute. - What's on your mind? - While you were gone, I began to think that all my life had come to no good. And, uh, well I'm met this man one day and he talked to me and he gave me a Bible. Ever since then, I've been a God-fearing man. When I lost you, I found Jesus. And, and don't laugh, but I feel like a better man for it. - Well, I'll be damned. (chuckles) What do you think of that? Well, you know a man's gotta go down the road he thinks that is the road he's gotta go down and should go down. I got a road I'm going down. - Well, you and Gale go on in. Every man's gotta make up his own mind. - Yeah, well my mind is leading me right in there and that's where I'm going. (O.B. chuckles) (bell tinkling) (upbeat music) (women chattering) (women giggling) - O.B. Taggart? (bell ringing) That's you? - Molly Plenty. - My little sweetheart. - [O.B.] Ah! - Oh-ho. How long has it been? You naughty old man. - Well, it has been a long time. I've been away, but I'm back now. You naughty little girl. (Molly giggles) (O.B. laughs) - I gave you up for lost. - [O.B.] Lost? - I went into mourning. - Oh, I know. Listen, I want you to meet my two boys. This is Gale. This is Slocum. - Well, just look at this. Strong, handsome and hungry for love. (Slocum gasps) - [O.B.] Say, what you got that's prime? - All depends on what you're looking for. Boys, this here's Lizzie. - [O.B.] Ah, Lizzie. - Uh-huh, that's Bertha. That's Loretta, she reads a lot. That's Sally, they say she's lined with velvet. - What you reckon that fellow over there's lined with? - So, you're $2 and she is- - I think I'll make me some room on that couch. - I think I'll be getting another drink. (upbeat music) - Molly, listen, I wanna talk to you about my son Slocum. First time he's ever been in a place like this, see? - Kiki. - [O.B.] Hmm? - Kiki's perfect. She's new, too. - [O.B.] Where is she? - Upstairs. - Go get her. That woman used to have more moves than a checkerboard. - What you reading little girl? - "Les Fleurs du mal" by Baudelaire. - Boda who? - Baudelaire. - What's that Baudelaire fellow, what's he talking about in that book? - Dark tales of naughty girls. ♪ For me ♪ - Are you a naughty girl? (she chuckles) Let me see a little something. I always like to know what it is that I'm buying. - You first. Show me a little bit of (chuckles) something. I wanna see what I'm selling to. ♪ Come home ♪ ♪ Ye who are weary come home ♪ - Yeah, Gale's gonna have a long, hard night. (O.B. chuckles) Little girl, my Slocum, he wants to see some more of those pretty legs. ♪ Oh sinner come home ♪ - This is Kiki. - And this is, get in there, Slocum. - Kiki, come on. Come on. This is Slocum. - Wanna dance? (Kiki gasps) Let me change the music. (gentle music) - What you looking at? They're gonna be just fine. - I hope so. - [Loretta] I come from across the ocean where a woman knows how to take care of a man. - You foreigners got a mighty peculiar way of getting ready for a poke. Let's just see if you can get naked standing on your head. - You can start with my stockings. - Me? All right. You know if I could stand on my head, we could just get ourselves a poke upside down. - Take the other one. (gentle music) - Don't you talk? Come on. Let's go upstairs. Don't be afraid. - Why don't you and I go in the back room? - What you got in mind? - Little old times. - [O.B.] Huh. - [Molly] Huh? - [Kiki] Your brother's in there. (bed springs creaking) (gentle music) (girl giggling) - What the hell is this? - My back started aching. - I thought by now you'd be snuggled down in a nice warm tub. Ready for me to come and scrub your back and scrub all those other little special places you used to like. - I used to love you scrubbing my back and all those special little places. - Well, what are we waiting for? - I don't want any scrubbing. I want rubbing. - What do you want me to rub? - My feet? - You want me to rub your feet? That's not the O.B. Taggart that I used to know. - Molly, I ain't the O.B. Taggart I used to know. ♪ Swing little girl ♪ - No! ♪ Swing her around ♪ - No! ♪ I'm gonna swing her upside down ♪ - Put me down! (hand slapping) - I'll put you down. (Loretta yelps) You slapped Gale Taggart, little girl. What you need's a good spanking and I'm gonna give you one right now. (Loretta yelps) (hand pats) (Loretta breathing heavily) (both moaning) (gentle music) - They're having a good time in there. - [Slocum] Soft like a pillow. (Kiki giggles) (gentle music) - Why don't you take your clothes off. - Uh, I get, cold. - Give me your hand. (gentle music) See? (Slocum chuckles) That's warm. - Warm. (Kiki chuckles) (gentle music) Oh! No! - What's the matter with you? (Slocum whimpers) What are you doing in a place like this? I'm gonna tell all the other girls, that you're just a big baby. - No! (whimpers) I'm not a baby! - You're just a big baby! - [Slocum] No, no, no I'm not! (Kiki crying) - That's Kiki crying. - Is she the one with Slo? - Yeah, it's her first time. - Hell, it's his first time, too, and he don't know bear shit from wild honey. Don't you know they're having a hell of a time. (Loretta giggles) - Rubbing feet. (O.B. sighing) O.B? - [O.B.] Yeah? - Can I ask you a question? - [O.B.] Go ahead. - Why did you want me to rub your feet? - It's the only thing that'll swell up. - Pa! Pa, she's gonna tell the other girls. She called me a baby. - A what? - A baby. - She's only a baby herself. - Well, we'll see about that. I'll fix that right now. - O.B., O.B., listen to me. We've got other girls. - That little girl's gonna become a woman right now. Come with me, son. (Kiki sobbing) What's this about my boy being a baby? (Kiki sobbing) Shut up! (Slocum crying) And you shut up, too! What's going on in here? - Why'd you have to bring him here? This is my first time. - I don't care if it's your first time or your 50th time. (Kiki sobbing) - Hey, you're interrupting my fornicating, you hear? - Do I hear? Listen, to this. (fist thudding) (man moaning) (glass shattering) (energetic music) - Pa, I think he heard you. (fist thudding) (man moans) (girls squealing) (man yells) (furniture crashes) (energetic music) - I think he heard us, Gale. - Bye, Pa. Bye, Pa! (birds chirping) (gentle music) - [Molly] Who's that over there? - That's my third son, Phoenix, the God-fearing one. He didn't even wanna meet you. - You know faith's a funny thing, it's here one day, gone tomorrow. - Much like 12 years. Well Molly, whoever I meet wherever I'm going, I'm gonna tell 'em to stop by here and they can have themselves are real good time. - Only those with money. After that ruckus last night and the damage. (boots stomping) - Which way we headed, Pa? - We're going to Placerville, right off in there. You and the boys saddle up, I'll catch up with you. I wanna talk to Molly. - Ma'am. Come on, Phoenix. Let's go, - [Loretta] Taggart! (melancholy music) (horse whinnying) - Molly, here, I want you to have this and give some of it to that little first time girl up there and see that she gets to school, huh. And some of it you use for all that stuff we broke up in there last night. The rest for you. (chuckles) Just for, for memories. You know what? My feet feel real good. (O.B. laughs) (melancholy music) (determined music) (wagon creaking) (horse hooves pounding) - Boys, there's the Irishman's place over there. I gotta go in and talk to them about a loan. - Well, I never thought the Irishman would still be here. - Well, where'd the hell you'd think he'd be, in Hong Kong? - Many people as he's cheated, I'm surprised somebody ain't closed him down or shot him. (wind whistling) - Morning, Sheriff. - Morning. - Wait a minute, there's the boarding house. Let's get down there and get a couple rooms and we'll unsaddle right there. - Pa, look who we got come to welcome us to town. (wind whistling) - Come on, Gale, let's tie up. - O.B. Taggart, uh, I heared you was a getting out. But I didn't reckon that you come back this way. - Well, I wasn't expecting to, Sheriff. Heh, am I right or wrong, but ain't you put on a few pounds? (sheriff laughs) - No more than you have in years, O.B. (O.B. laughs) State your business. - Oh, my business is honest. Wasn't honest, you wouldn't know anything about it anyway. (both laugh) Boys, say hello to this man. - Morning, sir. - Yeah, this is the man that turned me over to the feds so I could do 12 hard years in a cage. - No hard feelings. How long are you planning to stay in Placerville? - Yeah, I don't rightly know. We just got into town. Look around, it seemed like a nice place. - Well, you've been a thorn in the side of the law all your life, O.B. But like any man, you've got a right to start over. - Well, I aim to do just that. I, I ain't planning on going back to jail, Sheriff. (he laughs) Yeah, yeah, I wanna do right, Sheriff. Wanna do something good 'fore I meet the big warden in the sky. - Uh-huh. - [Jack] Morning, ma'am. - Looking for a good time, mister? - [Jack] You work here, do you? - Well, yes, I just began. - I reckon my saddle's older than you are, ma'am. (Kiki chuckles) Tell your boss that I'd like to have few minutes with her. (spurs jingling) - Thinking of trying one on, cowboy? - The name's Parris, Jack Parris. - I'm Molly Plantain. My friends call me Molly Plenty. Did one of them recommend this place? - I'm looking for O.B. Taggart. - Well, you're here now. It's not yet high noon. I've got three girls for you to choose from. You could have all three, honey, if you like. - I'm the brother of his dear departed Clara and I got a lot to talk to him about. Did they by any chance say where they might be heading? - They must be in Placerville by now, resting up. There's not much to do in Placerville, but rest up. Come on, cowboy. Why don't you come inside? Kick up your heels. - Sorry, ma'am. I can't accommodate you today. (determined music) - Pa, seems to be changing. - We must be getting close. - Then what's he wanna borrow from the Irishman? - You still don't get it do you, Phoenix? - [Phoenix] Just say it plain. - When O.B. Taggart walks soft around any man, especially a sheriff, it can only mean one thing. He don't want nothing getting in the way of what he's got going on. - Pa says to come get you. - Pa, getting mighty tough to tear myself away. All the excitement going on out there. - Nice place to rest up, Pa. Ma'am, where's your privy? - Right out back there. - Thank you, kindly. - That your boy? - Yeah, it's one of 'em. The other two are mine, too. - Uh, I'm one, too. - I just told her that, Slo. - $1.50 a night each, $8 for the week. - Pa, why don't you take the whole week? We're gonna be around here for awhile, ain't we? - [O.B.] Uh-huh. - If you stay on, we'll change the price. I've got number four with two beds and number five's a double. - [O.B.] We'll take 'em both. - Rachel, would you show these gentlemen to their rooms, please? Ah, Mr. Taggart and that one will take number five and the other two in number four. - Fine. Here it is. - Yeah, here it is. Slocum. Slo! (bed springs creaking) (O.B. grunting) - Are you sure the two of you can sleep in the same bed together? - Miss, I ain't very big. Besides, we're kin. Oh, God! - You know, mister, you have a tear in your sleeve. Right there. You know, if you give it to me tonight- - How old are you? - Nevermind how old she is. - 15. But, I'll be 16 soon. - That's it, miss. That's all we want. We don't need you anymore. Thank you for showing us. - Fine, I'll tell mama you enjoy the room. - [O.B.] Thank you. - Goodnight. - Thank you very much. Slocum. - [Slocum] Hmm? - Why is it you keep asking questions about nothing? - Pa, tonight. - What about tonight. - Don't snore. - Snore? - [Slocum] Hmm. (Slo imitates snoring) - I don't hear nothing. - Uh, where you going? - I gotta go over and see the Irishman. Listen, while I'm gone you, you keep your buttons buttoned. You understand me? (Slocum gasps) Huh. - Uh-huh. - [O.B.] Now, remember buttons buttoned. (door clicks) (determined music) - Well, there he goes. Waddling off across the street. You know he walks like he's got a gold nugget up his ass and wouldn't drop it for a dollar. (gun cylinder clicking) - You know, maybe he is gonna make a loan. - [Gale] No, not him. He'd just steal whatever he needs to keep from owing any man. - Then why's he going to see the Irishman? - Speed, he's gonna play this thing out till the very end. Just keep us hanging. - I'm getting too old to go chasing around after that old man hoping for a legacy that he don't wanna give me. (church bells ringing) I'm leaving ya. - I'll kill you first. (gun cocks) (tense music) You know, Speed, Pa always told us that you oughta give a man one last request. - What's yours? - Let's go get some whiskey. (horse neighing) (gentle music) - I don't know where it says in the scriptures that a man can't have drink at the end of a long day. (bell tinkling) - Howdy, mister. (bell tinkling) I don't believe I know you. - Just rode in. Is the Irishman in? - I ain't sure. I'll have to check. - [Irishman] O.B. is that you? - Yeah, that's, that's me, Irish. - [Irishman] Uh, Benji, let Mr. Taggart in. - (chuckles) Now I know who you are. You're O.B. Taggart. Now you can go in. - O.B., O.B., my God. (he groans) I been expecting you, Mr. Taggart. - Irish, what the hell is all this formal bowing for? - Do Irish a favor. Get rid of that smelly stogie. (metal clangs) (spit splatters) (cigar sizzles) (pot clatters) You never change. (gentle music) (Slocum sighs) - Hi. - What are you doing here? (water splashing) - Water, for washing. - You're not supposed to be here. - Well, you wanna wash up? What's the matter? You're not afraid of me are you? - No. (troubled music) - Do you like my hair? I brush it 50 times every morning and 50 times every night. - Pa said not to let nobody in. (gentle music) (door slams) (bolt clicks) - It was lucky that you were there with me 12 years ago. After I made the heist, I gave it to you. Otherwise those marshals woulda stolen my loot. - $80,000, I kept in safe place. - All right, you tell me where it is and my boys and I'll start digging it up in the morning. - No, not necessarily dig. - Don't tell me you got it someplace hidden around here. - You think I crazy? Be very big mistake. Many of my best customers are very dishonest people. (gentle music) - So nice and pretty. So's your hair. - Pretty, (chuckles) I'm sure your brothers could think of something more than that to say to a girl. - I'm different than them. (bed creaking) I'm Pa's favorite. (she squeals) (Slocum laughs) - You're strong and you're handsome. Probably the strongest one in your family, aren't you? - [Slocum] I don't like to fight. - Show me how strong you are. - No, don't touch, little girl. - Little girl? Little girl? Does this look like the petticoat of a little girl? - Go away. Pa told me I can't play with little girls. - It's okay. Your papa's out somewhere. Your brothers are out, too. Even my mama went to go visit a sick friend. So you see, it's just you and me. All by ourselves. - All right, where is, where is the gold? - The bank. They use the money you steal from them to make money for them and for you. - You mean I got $80,000, plus interest? - 80% of safe, 20% is my fee. - One-fifth? Why you pipe smoking, skinflint. - Careful how you talk. I have Irish temper. My fee for common crooks is one-half. But you different. You good father. Always take care of your sons. You gonna buy home now, settle down? - No, Irish, maybe this is not the right time for that. You see, I've gotta take my last born, Slo, to St. Louis. - St. Louis? In the prison, doctor told me that they got some good doctors in St. Louis that could maybe fix him and make him right. - Very expensive. - But very important to me, Irish. - You're not so little. - Hey, I didn't say you could do that. I'm gonna get your pa. (Slocum yelling) (Rachel yelling) - [Rachel] Please! Please! (basin clatters) - [Slocum] You lied to me! You lied to me! (tense music) You told that, you told me a lie. (pitcher shatters) (Slocum moans) You hit me. (Slocum crying) (Rachel yelling) You hit me. (Slocum gasping) (muffled screams) You, you lied to me! (Slocum crying) (Slocum yells) (Rachel wheezes) No, don't go sleepy. No, come back. Come back. (somber music) (Slocum screams) (Slocum sobs) Pa! - Boys, it aint' gonna be too long around these parts before land is gonna be worth a dollar an acre, mark my word. - Lies, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. - You got enough damn land. You're already wealthy. - [Card Player] I got a funny feeling after this hand I'm gonna get a little bit drunk. (men chattering) (upbeat music) - Looka there. It's Jack Parris. - Dear God. I'm gonna go tell Pa. You get his shotgun. He's gonna wanna finish this once and for all. (upbeat music) (men chattering) (man laughing) (anxious music) (Slocum panting) (wind whistling) (Slocum spits) (anxious music) (bell tinkling) Is O.B. Taggart in here? - Gale, what are you doing here? - He's alive. - Alive, who's alive? - Jack Parris, that's who's alive. (pots clang) (suspenseful music) - Jack Parris alive? - He's looking for us. (horse whinnying) (anxious music) - Here, Pa. We're back. - My God, this feels like family again, Pa. (upbeat music) (men chattering) (doors banging) ("Oh, My Darling, Clementine") - Three whiskeys. - Two, make mine a cola. - [Bartender] You bet. - We're gonna be in town a few days. Might as well put my name on the bottle. It's Taggart. You understand? Taggart. - I don't want no trouble in here, if you be Taggart. - He's Taggart. Them two there's his sons. (suspenseful music) - Jack Parris. Thought you was dead. - Not hardly. (spurs jingling) I warned you Taggart. My nephew, the dumb crazy one that lives up to his name, Slo, I want him. - You mean you came all the way here to this town to kill that kid? - That's right. I come to put him out of his misery. That way he won't have to feel guilty about doing this. (tense music) - Hmm, you're gonna kill him, Jack, you gotta kill me first. - I'm gonna put a bullet through your heart, too, for all the misery you've caused and what you done to my sister. - Where you gonna do it? You gonna, you gonna do it in here in front of all these people? - Go out in the street, old man. (suspenseful music) - Out in the street. Oh-ho, Jack, we been going out in the street all our lives. Yeah, yeah, I'm old. Used to be fast and quick. And you, when you was younger, there was nobody faster. Now I owe my boy Slocum a life. The other two, they don't even like me. Hate my guts. I've never known, Jack, what it was like to be liked. Hm, never knew love till I met your sister. (wind whistling) - What are you saying? - Our time has passed, Jack. It's over. I think we should take our hate, put it on the bar, have a drink of whiskey. (somber music) (guns clatter) (men chattering) - O.B., I never did wanna shake hands with ya, but I will now. - God bless you, Jack Parris. - Gotta little something for you here. (gunshot booms) (Jack moans) (woman screaming) - Jesus. (glass shattering) - [Man] Watch yourself. - May he rest in peace. - Amen. - Gale, what have you done? - Pa, that man's been wanting to kill you for years. And the thought of losing you, just broke my heart. - You all saw it. It was self-defense, right? - We all did, right boys? - Oh, yeah. - It was self-defense. (men chattering) - [Phoenix] Go back to your card game. - Taggart, what the hell goes on here? Everywhere you go you cause trouble. Is this your way of being honest? - Sheriff, that man went for a gun in his vest pocket. I saw metal. I shot him. - Oh, you saw metal and you shot him. - That's right. I saw it myself, Laughton. It was self-defense. (suspenseful music) (sheriff groans) - Here's your metal - God, that's the locket I gave Clara when Slocum was born. - You got more problems than a death of a gunfighter. - [O.B.] What are you talking about? - Your dumb one. - Slocum? - Yeah. - [O.B.] I left him alone. - Hold up! (crowd yelling) - Murderers. - Murderers. - Hold it, hold it! - They're calling us murderers. - Rachel Saxby was found dead in your room. Her neck was broke. - What's that got to do with my Slocum? - The dumb one was seen running up for those rocks. Now what does that add up to? - [Man] Let's go get a posse. - [Man] Let's go get a posse! (crowd yelling) - No, hold it, hold it! - Let me go get him. I'll find him and I'll, I'll bring him back. - [Man] Don't believe him! (crowd chattering) - All right. - Come on, Sheriff. - No! - [Man] No, Sheriff. (crowd yelling) - I'll give you that chance. But until the dumb one is found, I'm gonna keep one of your boys for security. - [Man] Yeah! (crowd chattering) (gun cocks) - [O.B.] Phoenix! (wind whistling) (gun trigger clicks) - All right, Pa. I'll stay. - All right now, let him pass. - No! - No! - [Sheriff] Let him pass! (crowd yelling) Quiet, let him pass. - All right, let's go. (crowd chattering) - [Gale] I'll be back for you, Speed. - [Woman] You can't trust them Taggart boys! They're all liars and cheats and murderers. - [Man] No good, Sheriff. - What do you reckon the Sheriff's gonna do to us if we don't find Slo? - Slocum's my son. We'll find him. (crowd yelling) Slocum! (voice echoing) (anxious music) Where are you? (voice echoing) Don't be afraid! (voice echoing) (thunder rumbling) - [Gale] Pa? Pa, I think I heard something. - [O.B.] Huh? - Back over there, I think I heard something. (thunder rumbling) (anxious music) - Gale, stay with the horses. I gotta talk to Slo. (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (gentle music) (Slocum whimpering) Slocum, come on out of there. It's your Pa. Slocum, it's your Pa. - Pa, oh, Pa. - It's me, boy. Oh God, it has to be like this, huh? - She, she got me all mixed up, Pa. I didn't mean. I got, I wanted to touch. I just wanted to touch, Pa. - Oh, what's gonna happen to you? Good God, boy, after I'm gone who's gonna take care of you? - We can have a place. We can have, we can have ducks and we can have cows. (Slocum imitates cow mooing) Yeah, and we could have corn and, and when it gets dark at night the stars come out and the moon is bright. It's so bright. (gunshot booms) (horse neighs) - Goodbye, little brother. (somber music) (wind whistling) (metal banging) - [Running Man] Get out here. The boy's back. (church bells ringing) - Lord Almighty. You didn't have to bring him back that-a-way. - Did you think I was gonna bring him back for you to hang? (Sheriff scoffs) I want my other son. I want Phoenix. - Well, I'm gonna have to make out some kind of report. - I'm gonna have to bury my son. (bird screeching) - [Phoenix] Pa, Gale. - [Sheriff] Here. (somber music) - God bless you, brother. - Saddle up. - Out back. There's room in the churchyard. You can bury him there. - Thanks, Sheriff, but Slocum never did get along with strangers. No we're gonna take him out of town a piece. Bury him some place out there under the stars, so he can have something to look at. (somber music) (shovel crunching) (wind howling) - [Gale] I reckon that's it, Pa. - Pa, you want me to read from the Bible? - No, Phoenix, I think it's only, only fitting that I say a few words. Lord, Slo, wasn't much on talking hisself. The boy wasn't, wasn't wasn't too right. Wasn't fit to take care of hisself. I tried to do everything I could, Lord. In fact, we, we all did. - That's right, Pa. - Shut up! Lord, I think that Slo's gonna have a grievance against you, 'cause you're not taking care of those that can't take care of theirselves. - God can't be blamed. - I wouldn't blame you, Lord, if you took it out on me being an old sinner. Be right. But I don't hold much to the sins of the father going to the, going to his sons. I don't think, Lord, that Slo is ever gonna forgive you. I know I ain't. (wind blowing) (birds chirping) Fellas, let's, let's get moving. - Where to, Pa? - Oh, we'll get holed up down here someplace. In the morning, I gotta get in to see the Irishman. I got business. - He's lying, Phoenix. (anxious music) He's gonna give us the slip and go for the gold. He's got it stashed up here somewheres. - He don't mean to give us one cent. - [Gale] We're gonna force his hand. Come on. You're gonna need this, Pa. - What? What do you mean? Nah, you, you, keep it yourself. - I ain't got no use for it, unless you tell me where to dig. - Dig? - Ever since you got out of prison, we've been heading in one direction. - All right, one direction. So what? - Well, we know you was gonna take Slo to St. Louis to those fancy doctors. - Sure, Pa. So you had to dig up that gold first. - Every penny of it for Slocum. Nothing for me. Nothing for Phoenix. You was gonna spend all of it on that loony. That loony don't need it no more, Pa. - I want you to both listen to me. I want you to listen to every word I say and listen real good! And what you both have done just now, I could kill you both and not feel nothing. (gun trigger clicks) - You ain't gonna kill nobody, old man. Just in case you forgot it, it was the two of us that helped you heist that gold 12 years ago and we mean to get our share of it. - (scoffs) Gale don't you know that gold is bad for you? Phoenix, you with that gun. Remember when I told you anybody that pulls a gun on O.B. Taggart and cocks that gun, is gonna have to keep that gun cocked the rest of his life. - Maybe so, but you were a lot younger then. - And we ain't little anymore, Pa, and we ain't fooling. - You're shit, hear me? You're shit. - Don't let him get to his shotgun, Speed. - I got him covered. (O.B. laughs) - I was just thinking, you know what boys? I deserve this whole damn thing that's happening up here on this mountain side for bringing you into the world! Even if it's a whore that couldn't be true to one man. And you, you Phoenix, coming out of a slut wanting to bring you up in some kind of fancy house with God knows what? - Don't take the name of the Lord in vain, old man. - God? (chuckles) Don't worry about that, you ain't no friend of God. - Pa! Our patience is running mighty thin. Now, where is that gold? Remember, we're family. - Family? (scoffs) Ah shit, we ain't family no more. Now get your asses outta here. Get on your horse and get your lives, out of my life. (trigger clicks) - Maybe it is better this way, Speed. - Are you crazy? - No. Maybe we oughta just run down to Texas and join up with a cattle drive or something. (gun trigger clicks) - Well, okay. - Good luck to you, Pa. - Don't take any wooden nickels. - Now, you two remember and don't forget, we're not family anymore! (birds chirping) (somber music) (metal scraping) (playful music) (tense music) Gale? (trigger clicks) - Man your age oughtn't to work that hard, Pa. - Yeah, especially when he's got two big, strong sons to help him. - You boys are off on the wrong trail. Cattle drive, my ass. (shovel pings) - Reason is, you lied to us, Pa. - Yeah, after you told us never lie to each other. - So you came to get your share? - After 12 years of waiting. 12 years is a mighty long time, Pa. - My own flesh and blood. You don't trust your own, Pa? - We don't need you know more, old man.

Phoenix, take that pistol. (wind whistling) - Can I have one last request? - Course you can, Pa. - I gotta pee. - You go ahead and pee. But first, where's that little sawed-off shotgun you always carry? - Over in the scabbard on the horse. You know I hear that anybody who gets it for the first time why, they lose all control, pee all over themselves. Yeah, you know I don't wanna end up a dead man with one wet leg. - Gale, that gun ain't here! (suspenseful music) - What? - Gale! (gunshot booms) (Gale moans) Phoenix! Get your ass away from the back of that horse! Keep your hand away that, that gun, too! You hear me? Don't you move you bastard. I know every move you make. - Wait a minute now. Uh, you know Gale and I coulda been dead wrong. But you and me, we can make a deal. - You know the first part of what you said, you were right. You're dead.

That old pipe smoker. I gave something the widow woman for her daughter, so she'd have a decent burial. Your two other brothers I killed them. I killed 'em dead because of their greed. (somber music) Slocum you was always talking about that spread you wanted some day. Yeah, yeah, it could start over here and end up out of sight over here. I did it all because I loved you Slocum.
