Come on, let's do this. Now you take this home and share with your little brother, okay? Thank you. Yeah, nice job! Nice job. Nice game. Nice shot, good game. I'm sorry, dear, I had to do it. Hey, I think you still got it. What, you doubted that? It's so good to see you! So good to see you. How was your trip in? Good, good. Ready to relax. You came to the right place, beer? Please. Sit, sit. So what are your plans? You planning on sticking around for a while? Yeah, I think so. I think I'm ready to get life established here, maybe go back to school. For what, I'm not sure yet, but I have enough money saved up, I think I can take my time before I make any decisions. But yeah, I'm ready to be home. Cheers. Rachel, there's someone I'd like you to meet. This is my boyfriend, Ryan. Ryan, it's nice to meet you. Likewise, I've heard a lot about you. So, uh, how long have you two been dating, then? We started dating last summer, so about a year now. We, uh, met at a job fair in college. Come on, volleyball. All right, well, I got to go. I'll catch up with you guys later. It was nice finally meeting you. You, too. Bye, you guys. Aren't they cute? Sorry. Nice, nice play. So we're thinking about heading out later, gonna go play pool or darts or something, you want to go? Rachel? Hey, you okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. They make a cute couple. Yeah, yeah, he's a really nice young man. He has a plan for his life. He's getting good grades, going to college, he's really focused. That's good. But yeah, yeah, I'll meet you guys out later at the club, like 10-ish? Yeah, perfect. Here. Not now, Ryan. Oh, come on. How about later? My parents are going out tonight, and we can have some alone time. Okay, suit yourself. Oh, so glad you're home Oh, I missed you so much. Oh, it's good to be home. Good. Oh, sit down, come on, you've had a long day. Wow, Reagan, this is amazing, thank you. So how did everything go today? How's the family? Great, got to see my sister, and Jamie, I can't believe how much she's grown up. Aw. Carol wants us to go out later, what do you think? Oh, yeah, that sounds good, around what time? Like 10-ish. But we don't have to go if you're not up to it. I'd be up for it, in a little while. So everyone left, I take it? Like 20 minutes ago. One more, let's do one more. I don't know about that. Come on. You know what we should do? What? We should film it. Film what? No. You don't think it'd be fun? I just think it.. No one's going to see anything. It'd just be for you and me, you know that. Well, I guess if it's just for me and you, then.. Okay, I'll be right back. Should we wave first? Sure? All right. Hey. Dammit. Jumpy much? Are you okay? Let me get a broom. You know, Rachel, I get that this is an adjustment, coming back home, I get that. I'm not pressuring you for anything, okay? Why don't you go back to bed? I'll clean this up. All right. How much you got? Uh, that's what I want to talk to you about. I need a loan, man, bad. I'm broke, but give me two weeks, and I'll have the money to you, you know it. You know how this works.. You know I'm good for that. You know how this works. I need something, you know this. All right, well, what about this? No, no, no. Okay, wait, wait, wait. What about this? What's this? Maybe something you could sell online or something? I don't know, it's a sex tape, man. Can you do something, I'm desperate, man. You've been pretty loyal. I like that. But if I can't move this, you owe me. Okay. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, this is Ryan, leave a message. Ryan, I've been calling you all day. Please call me back as soon as you get this. Please, Ryan. One more, let's do one more. I don't know about that. Come on. It would just be for you and me, you know that. Well, I guess if it's just for me and you, then... Hello? So, how's it feel to be back for a week? Yeah? All right, well, I'm thinking about going rollerblading at the park later if you want to go. Great, all right, I'll see you then. Jamie? Hey, Rachel's coming over, we're going to go rollerblading in the park later, if you want to go. Jamie? Jamie? Jamie? Jamie? Sorry if it's strong. It's okay, I'm tough. Thanks. Rachel? Jamie really loved you, she really looked up to you. Is it okay if I go see her room? Of course it is, you know you don't have to ask that. Thanks. Hey, I'll be right back. Rachel. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm okay, I was just leaving. Should we wave first? Sure. You're late. Time is money. That should catch me up, man, I told you I'm good for it. Good, real good. Hate to have to put you on one of my blacklists. Stay in touch. Yeah, and these.. Did they at least get over it after? She's in the back. Five bucks, thank you. You're welcome. What can I get for you, hon? Bacardi on the rocks, please. Here you go, sweetie. Is there a manager available I can speak to? Yeah, why don't you have a seat and I'll go check. It, um... It wasn't the best week. And it, um, it wasn't the worst. I'll push some of my old contacts and then generate some more revenue. Makes sense. You know, James? When things get rough, and you can't rely on your old friends, what do you do? What happens when their support, limited or substantial, what happens when it doesn't propel you anymore? Abandons you? Then? I, uh, don't know. You create, James. You create. He's available. Follow me, I'll take you to him. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for work. Do you have anything available? Are you looking for a waitress position? A talent position? I'm open to whatever you have. We have two clubs to work at. Here at the Illuminati, people come here for specialty drinks, karaoke, special events. Across town, we have Club Lava, where my girls provide more interactive entertainment. So, when could you start? Now. Perfect, I'll have one of the girls show you to the dressing rooms. There's outfits available there. Hey, hon. It is what it is. Want some? Suit yourself. Normally, I don't share, but the week's been good for me. So... Is this your first gig? No, I'm pretty well traveled, coast to coast. Pretty fancy, over there. What's your name? Angel. Classic, Angel. There have been a few Angels through here. But they all fly away eventually. I'm Bobbi, Bobbi Bounce. So Angel, if there's anything you need, just ask me. Maybe I can point you in the right direction. Actually, there might be something you can help me out with. Name it, Angel. Oh, that. Hey, it ain't Beverly Hills around here, honey. A girl can't be too careful, especially with some of the dirt bags that come around here. And I think you are going to be a very popular girl around here. So can you help me out? I kinda like you, Angel, you're cute. Now. You didn't get this from me, okay? So just go see Smoothy, she'll hook you up. And just be careful. This can be a very dangerous place. Shall we begin? Let's begin. Only 30 minutes in. It's going to be a long night. I'm thinking we should take this night to the next level. You? Saved by the bell, don't go anywhere. How can I help you? I'm looking for a handgun. Visit your local sporting goods store. Not with my record. Who gave you my address? A coked-out stripper gave it to me. Oh, well, in that case, let me see what we can do to help you. Don't mind the mess. Okay, I got a couple of rules: no children, and I don't care if little Joey broke into mom's house, no children, no expecting mothers, no one handicapped, physically or mentally, do you understand? Yeah, I'm just looking for a little extra protection, for when I get off work, on the street, and maybe a little something for at home. I'll take this one. I don't take credit cards or drugs, sweetie. This should about cover it, right? Enough with the bullshit, I don't care who you are, the average hooker doesn't have this much cash laying around. Are you a cop? No. CIA, FBI, DEA? No. Oh. Then I'll throw in some free clips. James, what's up, my man? Hey. There's been some issues with the last couple of batches I've been moving. How about a couple drinks, baby? Issues? Complaints. Go on. I'm not moving as much. It's been a rough couple of weeks, and Bev's on my ass about it. I need to know when I can start moving good stuff. What does Bev know, man, really? What does she know? I mean, really, what does she know? She scares the hell out of me, man. Can you please just get me some better merchandise? All right, all right, relax. I like you, James. Come back next week, I'll smooth things out, okay, cool. Shame it had to be done, really. I like James, he had potential. Go see what's taking so long. What the fuck is going on? You two, go check it out. Who the fuck are you? I want information. Anything but the answers I need really isn't important right now. You're working for.. I work for me. I'm looking for an individual or a group who would peddle amateur sex tapes online, I need names. Fuck you, bitch, you're dead, dead! Stupid bitch. Talk. You're lost in this maze, girl, lost and then poof, you're gone, carved up and lying in a ditch somewhere. I'll take my chances. I need a name, a place. Just say the word, boss. Kill that fucking bitch! Oh, shit. Now talk. His name is Billy. He runs around strip clubs, finding bitches, and he moves around from place to place, I don't know where he is! Hey, Johnson, what do you have for me so far? Five dead, all gunshot wounds, and a shitload of these. Coroner's on his way, we should have these bodies identified by the end of today. My guess is, once these bodies are identified, we're going to pull about 300 pages of their rap sheets. I've been assigned lead, so, have the first responder have his report to me by the end of the day. Will do. Thanks. You think this might be another territorial dispute, possibly? Maybe. Why did they leave those drugs over there intact? That'd be my first question. Then second, there's no gang markings. Don't you think that's strange? A gang would want to stake a claim on what they did here, send a message to their rivals, wouldn't you think? Maybe being efficient is their message. Well, I'm glad I finally got you out of the house, anyway, how are you holding up? Why? Why now? Carol... Was it something Rick or I did? No, absolutely.. How do you know? Carol, trust me. All right? Come on. So what can you tell me about Jamie's friends? I'm sure Ryan is crushed. They've been together a couple of years now, and they planned college near one another, and to stay together, I... I'm sure he's hurting too. Yeah. Been meaning to talk with him. Maybe later this week, I'll try. I'm sure he'd love to hear from you. I'll try to go see him soon. How are things going? Good. Really good. You have something for me? Yeah. New talent? Yeah. She's doing great so far. I'm impressed with what you're doing with this place. Keep it up. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. Is that all you got? Let's begin. Hey, love, do you mind if I go recruit? Things went well last time, right? It's a good start. We're just getting rolling.

Well, who do we have here? Billy, this is Angel, Angel, Billy. It's very nice to meet you. I'm looking to make some extra cash. Right to the point, I like that. Let's go talk.

Well, I'm off to Baltimore for the week. You sure you want to go? Maybe clear your mind, it would be good. Rachel? Oh, yeah. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah, it's fine. I think I'm going to stick around here for a bit. I was thinking about checking out some elective classes over at the community college. I'll just catch up with you in a few days.

It's right over there, there's a place for you that you can just go get changed and get ready. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to get some photography of you right here, on this backdrop, so why don't you just go get ready, and come on right back here, all right? Did you see the tits on the new chick that just came in? Gonna be a good night. More coked up she gets, the better. Yeah, Billy will take care of that part. Man, I hate it when they puke first. Billy's got to take it easy with these 15-year-olds. She might be 15, but they're all 18 online, bro. I heard that. Hey, you look great, just great. Hey, why don't you take a few more minutes and then come on over to the big set. We'll take some preliminary photos, then we'll take a short break, and then start filming then, all right? Okay, got it. All right, guys, that'll be all for now. Thank you very much. Why don't you please excuse us and come on back later? We will need you then. Great job. You are a natural. Here. Why don't you go in the back and relax a few minutes, and then come on back and, you know, strip, get ready for tonight's big scene? We'll get things rolling and have some fun, and then we'll pay you afterwards. What's the scene? It's going to be you and those guys that were just here a little while ago. It'll be hard work, but honey, trust me, you will be great. And besides, it's $500 in your pocket. Perfect. All right, Angel, let's see what you've got! Brick, turn on the black lights. All right, Brick, hit the strobe. What is it that you want? I can make a lot of things happen, try me! Just don't kill me. An amateur tape hit the net a couple weeks ago. Young couple, college ages, homemade video. It came into your possession and you put it out there. Yeah, yeah, yes, uh, I remember. We never get homemade stuff. I didn't shoot that, though, we had nothing to do with that. All right, all right? I got it from a local street thug who gets supplied by a guy named Red. I know. I know nothing else, I swear. Who's above you? What? Your cash flow from the videos, who do you report to? I can't, they will kill me for sure. Look, there's a lot of money to be made here. A name. All right, I split profits with a woman named Beverly. All right, it's Beverly. She has access to some of my girls. A lot of local dealers split profits with Beverly, okay? She launders money through her night club. That's all I know! I don't know nothing else, all right? All this for a tape? Look around you! All this for a tape made by some douchebag and his bitch? Damn. What information do you have so far? Nothing, just prints from everybody laying around here. It's like they were wiped out by a ghost. Found this weapon, sir. How much wasted ammunition would you say is around here? Not much, just a few holes in the wall, the computers shot to shit, why? Because someone who was a pretty good shot knew what they were doing, that's why. Hey. Hey. Some friends told me to try yoga. They said it would clear my mind. Is it working? No. Every time I close my eyes, I see her. It's going to take time, for all of us. I'm going out of town for the rest of the week, to join Reagan in Baltimore. You gonna be okay? Yeah. How's Rick holding up? He's my rock. I know it's been really tough on him too, but he's been holding it together for both of us. Everybody keeps saying, "Give it time, time heals all wounds." Every day that goes by still fucking hurts. I am so fucking angry! Why did this happen? Who made this happen? I mean, where does it end? When does everything get better? I can't be mad at everything around me forever. I don't know what Jamie would have wanted. But I do know that there has to be a limit to my anger. There has to be a limit to my rage. It's been brought to my attention that Billy was taken out last night. His whole set was a complete bloodbath. I wasn't aware he was putting a shoot together last night. Were you? No. Fucking runt. I'm sure he's been holding out on us. Do you know if any of our girls were involved? I don't know, but I'll find out. We'll go find out together. I hope everyone is well this evening and ready for a great shift. Before the night gets rolling, I have a question for everyone here. I'm aware that a filmmaker named Billy has been offering some of you employment. I'm fine with this, but please, if you have been in contact with him, please raise your hand. For those of you who did not raise your hand, please leave the room. I know you've been a well-respected employee of his. Did you work for him last night, by chance? No, the last I've seen of him was a couple days ago, he came in here looking for girls, and then he said that he was going to contact me about some gig, and, there's not a problem with me working for him, is there? No, no problem. I don't believe we've met, I'm Beverly, and you are? I'm Angel. Do you know of whom I'm speaking about, Angel? Yeah, like Bobbi said, he was in a couple days ago and offered me work. He said he'd get back to me, but I haven't heard from him. I understand. I have a request for you, if I may. May I please see your ID? Um, well.. Now. Please. Look, I'll still get paid under the table, right? That's one of the reasons I took this gig. Of course, nothing changes. Christine Phillips. I just like to know who's working for me on all levels. Angel, you're up. So, this Angel, is she your most recent hire? Well, yeah. She's really been doing great here. She doesn't seem a little strange to you? Like what? Like she could be trouble. Like a cop? I doubt that, she already has a rep for needing blow. I know one of the girls gave her contact info for Smoothy, for a handgun, I'm sure, but that's not unusual. Keep an eye on her. I'm going to pay an old friend a visit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me get my manager. Good evening, I'm Detective Trufont from the police department. Is the owner in? No, I'm sorry, she's left for the day. Well, I'm going to get right to why I'm here. Do you know this guy? Yeah, he's been in the club several times. Never had a problem with the guy to this point. What else can you tell me about him? What he does outside this club is none of my business, Detective. You mean, what he did. I'm sorry? We found him shot and killed late last night. What about this guy here? I know that he knows a few of the dancers here. What their relationships are, I don't know. For the past several months, he would stop into the club, maybe one or two times a month. I'm a manager here, if it doesn't cause problems or get a complaint, I don't ask questions. I understand. You mind if I speak to some of the dancers here? What about a search warrant? A warrant? You want a search warrant? I can get one if you want one. Look, just be quick, all right? We don't need to be scaring the girls away. I'll show you the way. Ladies, ladies, this is Detective Trufont with the police department. Relax, everyone, I'm not here for a bust. Just here to ask a few questions, that's all, thank you. Can I take a few minutes of your time? I go on in less than 10 minutes. I understand, I'll be quick. You work here long? About three years now. You know this guy? Billy, yeah, I know him, or I guess I should say, I've worked with him. He comes around the club, tries to recruit girls for his Z-level porno productions. It's good extra cash for the girls who take him up on it. There's nothing illegal about that, right? Thanks. Could I ask you a few questions? You ever seen this man? Yeah, I'm supposed to work for him next week, but I'm just trying to make some extra cash, I don't want any trouble, okay? You don't have to worry about making that meeting next week. Why's that? Because he's dead, that's why. Look, ladies. If you think of anything, anything at all, here's my card. Long time, no see, Bev. How can I help you? I've come for some information. You can put your cash away until I see if I can help. Somethings are getting interesting. First Red, now Billy. I heard. What have you heard? Nothing. Hard to go on anything when none of their stuff's been moving on the streets. That's because in both their deaths, nothing was taken. No drugs, no cash. Nothing. Who have you sold to lately? My reputation is based on confidentiality. You should know that. Look in the envelope, it'll make me a preferred customer. Yeah, I'm the collections business lately. Other than the normal street scum, there's been nothing unusual. There never is. You know, I hate to think of us becoming not so good friends over this issue. What would happen then? What would happen? Anything you think I should know? Pay me a visit. Time for a vacation. They've been on foot for about seven minutes. We've got to keep moving. Reese, don't move, the area's trapped! How many, how many out there? We're getting out of here now, right now. I just need you to keep it together a little bit longer. Try it. What can I do for you? All I need is a name. Take it easy, do I know you? Probably. I've met some of your friends already. So you're the one who's been.. Yeah. I'm a little fish here. Around here, you should know that everything goes through.. Beverly? Well, then you know that I'm a middleman, and I don't make half as much as those guys do. A young man gave you a tape recently. Can you tell me about that? Cokehead, desperate, didn't have the money, so I took the tape, flipped it to Billy, whom you have met, and that's where my involvement ends. I am pretty sure I'm going to see that kid next week, though. So where does Beverly fall into all this? Beverly's top of the pyramid, king of the mountain. And now that you've taken out two of her top dogs, she's definitely going to be coming after you. She won't have to. This is all about the tape, that's what this is about? Listen, I didn't want anyone to get hurt. I just figured it was some strung-out kid and some stupid slut. So what's the next move, Detective? Better get on the phone to Trufont. Trufont. Yeah. Okay, 20 minutes. Yeah. Stop it. Come on, man. We recovered these items from Billy Williams's residence. I thought you might like to see them, sir. Thank you. Where were you at the time of the assault? I'm not telling you. We've got a positive ID on the victim from the movie house. James Hanlon, 27, ran a make on him, it's everything in the report there. He got busted for possession a couple of years ago, but what I think you might find interesting is who posted bail for him back then, it was Beverly. Beverly? She's the same woman that posted bail for Billy Williams when he got busted. Yes, seems so. Huh, run a make on her. Already done, she's clean, not even a parking ticket in her name. There's gotta be a connection. I went to her club the other day on State Street. She wasn't there. We've got to find this woman. I'm sure she's on somebody's hit list. I'm going to need a search warrant on this one. I'll get on that. Thanks. Miss Baldwin. Yeah? I'm not sure if you remember my name or not. Father Kirkland. Well, yes. You have a good memory. I just wanted to stop by to see how you and your family were doing. I haven't seen your sister in church lately. Yeah, she's taking it pretty tough. You know, it's been really hard on all of us. Everyone grieves differently, Rachel. I'd like to offer you my card, and invite you all back to services. Please don't hesitate to call, even just to talk. Psalm 91:11 reads, "God commands his angels concerning you, "to guard you in all your ways." Jamie is an angel now, looking down on you. I hope you know that. Here on Earth, it seems your sister could use an angel. Maybe that angel is you. Have a good day, Rachel. Sir? Yeah? We just got a lead into that shooting at the movie house last night. Young man called in, said he wanted to talk to the lead on the case. I have his info and transcript of his call here for you. Leave it on the corner of the table back there. Interesting. I'm Detective Miles Trufont from the police station. Mind if I come in? Sure, come in. Pretty nice house you have here. It's my parents', they're on vacation for another week. So I'm going to get to why I'm here, Ryan. It is Ryan, right? You called the station, and you said that you have some information that may benefit us regarding that shooting last night in the movie house. We'll start from the beginning, what do you have for me? I knew the man killed, James. He was selling me cocaine on a regular basis. For how long? Uh, several months. I would meet him downtown at various spots. He was into more than just drugs, but to what extent, I don't know. I just know that when I was short on cash, I sold him a tape with me and my girlfriend on it. I didn't want anyone to get hurt from it, or anything like that. The tape got on the net, and my girlfriend, she, she killed herself. She tried to have the footage removed, but it didn't happen. I'm sorry to hear that. So you think this shooting victim was responsible for the contents of that tape being distributed, is that what you think? I don't know. He would have given it to someone and they possibly would have. Do you have some photos of your girlfriend? Is this your girlfriend? Yes, Jamie. Who's that in the photo with her? That's her Aunt Rachel, Rachel Baldwin. Rachel Baldwin, tell me about her. I had just met her, so I don't know a lot about her, only heard stories through Jamie about her. She's in the military, she just got back from overseas. Military? Military. You have any way I can get in contact with her? Phone number or anything? I don't have her phone number or anything. Look, please don't tell Rachel about the tape, she'd kill me. Ryan, here's my card. If you think of anything else that could help, give me a call. Anything. Okay, I can show myself out, thanks. This is Detective Trufont. I need a make on a Rachel Baldwin, middle 20s, she lives locally. And I also need an update on that warrant for that club on State Street. I'm heading there now. Can I help you? I need to speak to Beverly. Do you have a warrant this time, Detective? It's processing, you want to wait? I believe she's in danger.
