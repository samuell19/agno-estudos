VERY FUNNY. ( man speaking Italian ) I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GOOD, US BEING HERE. ( woman on radio speaking Italian ) SHIT. WHAT? I CAN'T FIND MY WALLET. PUT IT IN YOUR SUITCASE? NO. IT'S NOT IN MY SUITCASE. WHY WOULD I PUT IT IN MY SUITCASE? WELL, IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. MAYBE IT'S IN THE CAR. THANK YOU. ( speaking Italian ) SHE'S LOST HER PURSE. HER PURSE. ( speaking Italian ) WILL YOU JUST GIVE HER A MINUTE? UNO... UNO MOMENTO. UNO MOMENTO. ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. ( speaking Italian ) WHEN DID YOU HAVE IT LAST? THE TRAIN STATION, I THINK. THE EXCHANGE BOOTH. SHIT. OH, JANEY, I'M SORRY. THAT BASTARD AT THE TRAIN STATION STOLE IT WHEN YOU DROPPED ALL YOUR STUFF. THIS IS 170, NOT 70. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO? WE NEED 70. HERE WE GO. IS THIS IT? I THINK SO. IT'S NICE. YES, I HAVE HER CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ON FILE IN MY COMPUTER. YES, I HAVE THEM HERE. OKAY, 5-5-3-3... 7-6-4-5... 8-7-8-7... 9-1-5-7. 5-7. YEAH. EXPIRES 12-15. NO, SHE'LL DEFINITELY NEED ANOTHER CARD SENT OUT IMMEDIATELY. WE'RE HERE FOR TWO WEEKS. NO, I'M WORKING HERE. YES, I'LL HOLD. YOU LOVE HOW THEY ASK? AS IF I HAVE A CHOICE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA TRY TO DO WHILE I'M HERE? BESIDES LEARN ITALIAN? I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK THAT'S SO RIDICULOUS. I DON'T AT ALL. I ADMIRE YOU. I JUST THINK IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS. AND BESIDES, WHAT'S THE POINT? THE WHOLE BLOODY WORLD SPEAKS ENGLISH. WELL, I... AM GOING TO FINALLY TRANSCRIBE THE TAPES. YES? ALL RIGHT. OKAY. WELL, IF YOU CAN SEE IT THROUGH TO THE END, I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? NOTHING. NOTHING? I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA, JANE. I ALWAYS HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT. ( object clatters ) JUST DIDN'T SOUND VERY SUPPORTIVE. YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT. I'M SORRY IF THAT CAME OUT WRONG. I JUST KNOW HOW EMOTIONAL LISTENING TO THEM CAN BE... HAS BEEN FOR YOU. I THINK ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED. WELL, THAT'S GREAT. ( indistinct loud voices ) WHY DO YOU THINK HE KILLED HIMSELF? WHO? DAVID FOSTER WALLACE. I... I... I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN'T GET A SENSE BY HIS WRITING? YOU'LL HAVE TO READ IT WHEN I'M DONE, DARLING. DO YOU THINK HE RECOGNIZED A BLANK INFINITY JUST STRETCHING OUT? HE GOT TO THIS POINT, MAYBE, WHERE... IT WAS JUST DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. I REALLY DON'T KNOW, JANE. JUST SO TEDIOUS. AND THEN OF COURSE, HE FELT GUILTY. MOST PEOPLE THINK LIFE IS TOO SHORT, AND THERE HE WAS, ALL THE TALENT IN THE WORLD, AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH. JANE, CAN I-- CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS? IT'S JUST A BIT MORBID. ( distant siren blares; distant, indistinct voices ) LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU, TOO. DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT? YOU FEEL OKAY? YEAH. YOU SURE? MM-HMM. ( distant siren blares ) ( siren recedes ) ( passionate gasps ) ( distant male laughter ) ( distant, indistinct male speech ) ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T COME WITH? YOU'LL BE SO BUSY. MIGHT GET BORING ALL ALONE. I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD BE HERE IN CASE THE CARD IS DELIVERED. TRUE. AND THEN I THINK I MIGHT GO OUT, SEE WHAT THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER. WELL, IF YOU DO, LEAVE ME A MESSAGE, OKAY? SO I CAN WORRY ABOUT YOU. OKAY. I'VE LEFT YOU SOME MONEY HERE. THANK YOU. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. HAVE A GOOD DAY. Jane: TESTING. TESTING. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY STORIES FOR MY BOOK? Grandmother: WHAT KIND OF STORIES? STORIES THAT YOU'VE PREPARED. OR I CAN ASK FROM A LIST OF STORIES THAT DAD TOLD ME ABOUT? GO AHEAD AND ASK FROM YOUR FATHER'S LIST, GOD REST HIS SOUL. LET'S START WITH THE WAR. WE WENT INTO AN AIR RAID SHELTER. MY MOTHER, YOUR GREAT-GRANDMOTHER. SHE WAS SHAKING. THE SIRENS WAILED AND... THEN THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A BOMB, AND THE MAN NEXT TO US, HE SAID, "I WAS IN A SHELTER LAST NIGHT WITH MY WIFE AND MY LITTLE BOY, AND HALF OF IT GOT BLOWN AWAY." THERE WAS BLOOD IN HIS HAIR. HE WAS ALL ALONE. THAT NEARLY FINISHED MY MOTHER, YOU KNOW. HERE WE WERE IN THIS TINY TOWN IN ENGLAND, MILES FROM GERMANY, FROM RUSSIA, FROM ITALY, FROM ANY FRONTLINES, AND THIS MAN, HE HAD BLOOD IN HIS HAIR. ( speaking rudimentary Italian ) ( speaking rudimentary Italian ) Grandmother: WE WERE RIDING OUR BIKES TO SCHOOL WHEN THE GERMANS STARTED FIRING AT US. WE JUMPED INTO A HEDGE. WE WERE TERRIFIED, BUT... AFTERWARDS WE COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING. ( chuckles wistfully ) IT FEELS NOW AS IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERS THAT. IT'S AS VIVID TO ME AS IF IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. OH, HI, LEONARD. IT'S JANE. I DECIDED TO TAKE AN IMPROMPTU TRIP TO ISCHIA. OR, UM, "EE-SCHIA," AS THEY PRONOUNCE IT. SEE, I'M LEARNING A LITTLE BIT. UM... ANYWAY, I'LL BE HOME LATER. I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. BYE. Grandmother: THOSE FRIENDS ARE ALL DEAD NOW. THERE'S NO ONE LEFT. THAT'S ONE OF MY REGRETS, YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE CHILDREN, NOT JUST YOUR FATHER. YOU'RE ALL ALONE NOW THAT YOUR PARENTS ARE GONE. NO BROTHERS, NO SISTERS. I'M UPSETTING YOU. Jane: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. YOU WANT TO ASK ME MORE BORING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAR? ALL RIGHT, THEN. ( speaking rudimentary Italian ) THE CASTLE? CASTLE? ( asking question in rudimentary Italian ) NO? NO. UM... ( speaking rudimentary Italian ) AH. ( both speaking Italian ) Grandmother: HE'D BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE NECK. THE BULLET WENT IN ONE SIDE AND CAME OUT THE OTHER. AND THERE WERE ALL THESE BOMB HOLES FILLED WITH WATER, AND HE COULDN'T TELL WHICH WAS THE GERMAN SIDE AND WHICH WAS THE ALLIED SIDE. WHEN HE CAME HOME AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU COULDN'T REALLY COMPLAIN TO HIM ABOUT ANYTHING, NOW COULD YOU? I'M ACTUALLY GOING THERE NOW. TO THE CASTLE. YOU SPEAK ENGLISH NOW? YEAH. WHY, DID YOU THINK I WAS ITALIAN? YEAH. YES! THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S COOL. HEY, HEY, HEY. WHERE YOU FROM? LONDON. NO, IN AMERICA, COME ON. MAINE. NO SHIT. I'M FROM MASSACHUSETTS. THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S WEIRD. RIGHT? YEAH. VACATION? OH. ARE YOU? WHAT? ARE YOU HERE ON VACATION? SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING YOU WERE ON VACATION. ME? NO. SO, COME ON. MY HUSBAND IS WORKING IN NAPLES. WHAT DOES HE DO? HE IS PLAYING IN A CONCERT AT THE END OF THE MONTH. COOL. WHAT DOES HE PLAY? VIOLA. MNH MNH MNH! THE VIOLA! HE ANY GOOD? YES. VERY. HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR VIOLIN FROM GETTING STOLEN? YOU PUT IT IN A VIOLA CASE. RIGHT? NO, THAT'S NOT FUNNY. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VIOLA AND A COFFIN? A COFFIN HAS A DEAD PERSON ON THE INSIDE. 'CAUSE VIOLA PLAYERS ARE DEAD, NO? WHY IS A VIOLA SOLO LIKE PREMATURE EJACULATION? ( snickers ) BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S COMING, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. I CAN'T HELP IT, I'VE GOT THIS WEIRD AUTISTIC MIND FOR JOKES, AND I WENT TO THIS MUSIC-SLASH-NERD SUMMER CAMP WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 10, AND I PLAYED THE TRIANGLE. RIGHT. AND I'M AN ONLY CHILD, SO... YOU KNOW, UNDERSTAND. YOU LOOK TOO YOUNG TO BE MARRIED. ARE YOU A NEWLYWED? NO. NO. YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL LIKE A STALKER. FUCK. ( speaking Italian ) Woman: GRAZIE. GRAZIE. UNO. ALL RIGHT. UH, HEY, HAVE YOU GOT 50 CENTS? IF YOU CAN CATCH IT. GRAZIE. GRAZIE. WHAT BROUGHT YOU OUT HERE TODAY? THE FERRY. HA! "THE FERRY." I LIKE IT. THEY HAVE THIS DEVICE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT. IT'S LIKE A TORTURE CAGE. THEY'D LOCK YOU IN THERE UNTIL YOU TURNED TO BONES. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE DYING BY JUST SITTING THERE? THAT WOULD SUCK. IN, LIKE, THE 1300s, THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LIVED IN THIS CASTLE. MUST'VE SMELLED PRETTY BAD, ALL THOSE PEOPLE CRAMMED ONTO THIS ROCK. WOW. I KNOW. I'VE BEEN COMING HERE EVERY DAY, AND IT STILL GETS ME. IF ONLY WE COULD KILL OFF ALL THE TOURISTS. ( scoffs ) YOU'RE A TOURIST. NO I'M NOT. I CAME OUT HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO WITH THIS VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO STUDYING THE RELIC POPULATIONS OF DOLPHINS AND WHALES IN THE GULF OF NAPLES. I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE JOKING. I'M DEAD FUCKIN' SERIOUS. NO, I JUST DIDN'T WANNA GO TO COLLEGE, AND THEY PAID FOR ME TO COME OVER. FOUR CONNECTING FLIGHTS, A 72-HOUR PLANE RIDE. BUT, YOU KNOW... IT WAS WORTH IT. MY FIRST TIME OUT OF THE U.S. HOW OLD ARE YOU? I'M 19. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY. IS IT REALLY? UH-HUH. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH, SO, I LEFT THE PROGRAM AFTER, LIKE, A MONTH. FUCK THE RELIC DOLPHINS! I'M STILL ON THE ISLAND 'CAUSE I HAVE THIS-- THIS AWESOME LIVING SITUATION. I'LL TELL YOU THE SHORT VERSION. BASICALLY, I USED TO HAVE ANCESTORS IN ISCHIA, SO WHEN I COME OVER, I FACEBOOKED THIS SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED. A SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, IS WHEN ONE PERSON'S GREAT-GRANDPARENT IS ANOTHER PERSON'S GREAT-GREAT-GREAT GRANDPARENT. I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE LONG VERSION. SORRY. ANYWAY... SO THIS RELATIVE GAVE ME THE NAME OF THIS GREAT UNCLE WHO LIVES ON THE ISLAND. SO I SHOW UP... HE ANSWERS THE DOOR AND HE'S LIKE THE OLDEST FUCKER I'VE EVER SEEN. EASILY PUSHING 100. 100? YEAH, IF NOT OLDER. HE'S, LIKE, DEAF AND BLIND AND ABOUT FOUR FEET TALL, AND HE MUMBLES A COUPLE THINGS TO ME IN SOME CRAZY DIALECT, USHERS ME INSIDE, POURS ME A GLASS OF WINE, AND LEADS ME TO THIS BASEMENT APARTMENT. AND, UH, YEAH, I NEVER LEFT. ( female vocalist singing operatic music ) ( operatic music fades ) "LOVE TEACHES ME TO FEED ON FLAMES AND TEARS, "TO TURN WITHERED HOPE GREEN THROUGH DESIRE, "TO RE-ENSLAVE MY HEART EACH TIME LOVE FREES HIS NOBLE FACE FROM THAT HEAVY DISDAIN." WHO WAS THAT? VITTORIA COLONNA. AH. THE WOMAN WHO LIVED HERE. YOU READ THAT IN YOUR GUIDEBOOK THIS MORNING, DIDN'T YOU, JANE? SNEAKY. YEAH, I'VE DECIDED TO LEARN ITALIAN BY COMMITTING TO MEMORY ALL THE SONNETS SHE WROTE TO MICHELANGELO IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN. I THOUGHT MICHELANGELO WAS GAY. AH, ACCORDING TO HISTORY AND THE MUSCULAR THIGHS OF HIS SCULPTURES, YES. BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HER FROM LOVING HIM. LET'S HEAR IT, THEN. IN ITALIAN. LET'S HEAR THE POEM. COME ON. OKAY, OKAY. ( reciting haltingly in Italian ) ( clapping ) WHEW! I'M IMPRESSED. THANK YOU. YOU HUNGRY? WHY? YOU GONNA TAKE ME OUT? YEAH. ALL RIGHT THEN. OKAY. Caleb: TWO PASTAS WITH THE HOUSE SAUCE, PLEASE. RED, PLEASE. Man: WHITE OR-- RED. UH-HUH. THANK YOU. GRAZIE. SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT GONNA TELL ME WHAT YOU DO? I WRITE FREELANCE ARTICLES ABOUT PARTIES AND FASHION TRENDS IN TOWN AND COUNTRY UK. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. I'M WRITING A BOOK... ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER'S EXPERIENCES IN RURAL ENGLAND, LIVING THROUGH TWO WORLD WARS. I RECORDED HER FOR HOURS AND HOURS. BUT NOW... I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW? YOU WANNA LISTEN, A LITTLE? YEAH. YEAH? YEAH, NO, I LOVE TO LISTEN. IT'S ALL TANGLED UP. HOLD ON. OKAY. Grandmother: AWFUL AS IT WAS, IT MADE YOU STRONGER. THESE DAYS PEOPLE WHINE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS, AND I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE OLD PEOPLE WHO THINK MY TIME HAD THE ONLY JOY AND THE ONLY PROBLEMS. WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN PRIVATE WARS, EVERY ERA. BUT IT WAS NOTHING LIKE-- IT REALLY BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER, THE WAR. WE HELPED EACH OTHER DURING THAT TIME. WE HAD TO LAUGH, WE HAD TO SMILE. WELL, IF NOT FOR OURSELVES, THEN FOR THE PEOPLE WE'D LOST. NOW SHUT THAT THING OFF, WOULD YOU? GET IT OUT OF MY FACE! THAT IS LIKE-- IT'S LIKE A WINDOW IN TIME. THE SORT OF THING YOU WISH YOU ALWAYS DID BEFORE SOMEONE DIED, YOU KNOW? MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M NEVER GONNA FINISH IT. YOU SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS. WE MET WHILE I WAS RECORDING HER. BONDING OVER GRANNY, HUH? YOU MAKE IT SOUND PERVERSE. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, RIGHT? ( speaking Italian ) I GOT PREGNANT, SO WE GOT MARRIED. I LOST THE BABY. I'M SORRY. ( speaking Italian ) I DIDN'T GO BACK AFTER THAT TO THE STATES. DID YOU, UH, DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY ABOUT THE RED STRING? I THINK I MIGHT HAVE. TELL ME. IT'S LIKE THIS ASIAN PROVERB. SAYS THAT ANYONE YOU'RE DESTINED TO MEET, LIKE, UH, YOUR SOUL MATE OR YOUR FAMILY OR, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE YOU BUMP INTO ON THE STREET, WE'RE ALL CONNECTED... BY THIS RED STRING. IT CAN BE TANGLED OR STRETCHED, BUT IT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN. THERE'S THIS MOMENT IN THE TAPE. I'M SITTING, WAITING, IN THE AIRPORT BAR FOR MY FLIGHT, AND I'M TALKING INTO THE RECORDER, RAMBLING ON ABOUT HOW I'M ABOUT TO EMBARK ON THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE, HOW I'M GONNA SHOW WORLD WAR II FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. BUT? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT INTERESTING. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, ISN'T IT? KEEPING IT INTERESTING FOR YOURSELF. MAYBE. MAYBE I JUST WANNA WRITE ABOUT NOTHING. EVERYTHING IS NOTHING. ALL THE BEST. ( chuckles ) ( both speaking Italian ) MAKE A WISH, HUH? MAKE IT GREAT. OKAY. BRAVO. BRAVO. HEY. ( playful growl ) ARE YOU READY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, AM I READY? GRAB MY HAND. GO, GO, GO! WHAT? WHY? OH, MY GOD! GO! OH, MY GOSH! ( shouting in Italian ) WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? GO! ( man shouting in Italian ) ( shouting in Italian ) ( indistinct, panting remarks ) IT'S THE CARIBINIERI! WHAT? THE POLICE! COME ON! NO! NO! NO! YEAH! YEAH, YEAH! WE CAN'T GO BACK! IF WE GO BACK, WE GET ARRESTED! OKAY. RUN! WE CAN'T PAY IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY MONEY! OH, GOD. COME HERE. OH, GOD. HEY. HEY. WHAT? Would it make you feel better if I said I set the whole thing up? Yes, if it's true. Is it true? I paid the check when I went to the bathroom. ( laughing ) You're horrible. You're horrible. You're a mean, horrible person. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. Quick! Let's go! Why are we still running? I don't know why we're still running. ( gasping ) OH, MY GOSH. ( laughing ) IT WENT UP MY NOSE. ( comical snort ) WILL YOU COME BACK? MAYBE. "MAYBE" IS NOT A "NO," AND SINCE I DON'T HAVE A PHONE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER. FOR CHEAP THRILLS AND FUTURE CRIMES COMMITTED. ( emphatically ) NO. FAIR ENOUGH. I'D BETTER GO... CATCH A FERRY. HEY. WHY DO VIOLISTS... KEEP THEIR VIOLA CASES ON THEIR DASHBOARDS? WHY? SO THEY CAN PARK IN HANDICAPPED SPOTS. OH. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU. ( distant, indistinct shouting ) YOU'RE AWAKE. NO, I'VE GOT SO MUCH OF THIS STUFF TO GET THROUGH. YOU BOUGHT FRUIT. NICE. Grandmother: THERE ARE THE GREAT BIG EVENTS, THE THINGS YOU THINK YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER, AND YOU DO, BUT THERE ARE OTHER SMALLER-- PICKING A BLACKBERRY THAT'S BEEN IN THE SUN, OR BRUSHING THE FINGERTIP OF SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU LOVED UNTIL YOU TOUCHED THEM. NELLIE WAS THIS LITTLE COLLIE WHO WOULDN'T GO ON A LEASH, SO SHE HAD TO SIT ON A BICYCLE SEAT. THEY STAY WITH ME, TOO. ( distant traffic sounds ) JANE. JANEY? GOT SOME PASTRIES. YOU STILL ASLEEP? JANE? Grandmother: MY FRIENDS HAD LOTS OF AMERICAN BOYFRIENDS, AND THEY USED TO BRING US NYLON STOCKINGS AND CHOCOLATES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS. AND WE USED TO GO TO LONDON, AND... WE SAW GLEN MILLER ONE TIME. OH, WE USED TO GO ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY WERE WONDERFUL TIMES. I NEVER HAD AN AMERICAN BOYFRIEND. I LIKED SOME OF THEM. THEY WERE NICE BOYS, BUT... I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE MY MUM AND DAD. I WISH I HAD, SOMETIMES. Jane: YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE 19 AND THE WORLD JUST FELT SO OPEN AND CAREFREE AND FULL OF POSSIBILITY? HE REMINDED ME OF THAT. OF THAT TIME. YOU WERE 19 WHEN WE MET. YEAH. I WOULDN'T HAVE DESCRIBED YOU AS CAREFREE BACK THEN. NOT AT ALL. WELL, I FELT NOSTALGIA... OR SOMETHING... FOR YOUTH. YOU'RE NOT OLD, JANE. WE RAN OUT ON THE BILL. YOU JUST RAN-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU RAN OUT ON A BILL? PERHAPS I'M NOT EXPLAINING IT WELL. IT WAS... IT WAS FUN. IT WAS JUST FUN. ( church bells toll ) HOW WAS WORK? THE CONDUCTOR IS ACTUALLY A DESCENDANT OF WALTER LEGGE, WHICH IS FASCINATING. THE THREE OF US SHOULD PLAN A DINNER BEFORE WE LEAVE. I'D LIKE THAT. JANE? OH, MY GOD. IT'S-- YOU'RE AWAKE. NO, I'VE GOT SO MUCH OF THIS STUFF TO GET THROUGH. YOU BOUGHT FRUIT. NICE. Grandmother: THERE ARE THE GREAT BIG EVENTS, THE THINGS YOU THINK YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER, AND YOU DO, BUT THERE ARE OTHER SMALLER-- PICKING A BLACKBERRY THAT'S BEEN IN THE SUN, OR BRUSHING THE FINGERTIP OF SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU LOVED UNTIL YOU TOUCHED THEM.

THE CONDUCTOR IS ACTUALLY A DESCENDANT OF WALTER LEGGE, WHICH IS FASCINATING. THE THREE OF US SHOULD PLAN A DINNER BEFORE WE LEAVE. I'D LIKE THAT. JANE? OH, MY GOD. IT'S-- THAT'S WHERE THE BUDDHIST MONKS UNROLL ALL THE TAPESTRIES ON THE HILL, RIGHT? THE MONKS, THE MONKS, THE MONKS. IT'S SO PRETTY. HOW DO YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF? OH, BIT OF THIS, BIT OF THAT. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I'LL WALK YOU. DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PEN? YOU GOT A PEN? YEAH, I HAVE A PEN. OKAY. I HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER. YOU GUYS SHOULD DEFINITELY COME OVER TO THE ISLAND.

You're so sexy. And beautiful. I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO THIS. WHY? WHY? I CAN'T DO THIS. WHY? DO YOU DO THIS A LOT? WHAT? DO YOU DO THIS A LOT? WHAT? DO YOU SEDUCE WOMEN? IS THIS WHAT YOU DO? YOU NEED TO BE LESS SERIOUS. DON'T FOLLOW ME. Grandmother: THERE WAS ONE BOY FROM BELGIUM. HE WAS LOVELY. HE HAD A MUSTACHE. ( laughing ) MY MOTHER HATED MUSTACHES. BUT HE WAS SHIPPED OFF. I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. ANYWAYS, I MET YOUR GRANDFATHER NOT LONG AFTER, AND WE GOT MARRIED. Jane: WAS IT LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT WITH GRANDPA? LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT? STOP THAT THING. WE'RE-- LEONARD.

PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON ME. I HAVE TO GO TO WORK. OKAY. Grandmother: IF IT WASN'T THE WAR, IT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T THERE? BUT THAT'S THE THING. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT STRUGGLE. I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME TEA. DO YOU WANT SOME? I'M ALL RIGHT. YOU GO OUT LIKE THAT AGAIN, JUST TELL ME. I WORRY. OKAY. I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD. DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ACTUALLY DOES US ANY GOOD? IN THE LONG RUN? OR DO WE JUST MAKE OUT "STRUGGLE" TO BE SOMETHING MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THAT'S ALL MOST OF US HAVE? I TELL YOU, NEXT TIME WE COME TO ITALY... WE NEED TO GET A PROPER KITCHEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY, JANE. IF ONE LITTLE THING HAD CHANGED IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S LIFE, I MIGHT NOT BE HERE. SOMETIMES I WORRY I'M NOT HONORING HER. WITH THE BOOK? NO, WITH MY LIFE. THIS IS IT, YOU KNOW. IT ENDS WITH ME. Grandmother: IN THE HARVEST TIME WE ALL WENT TO THE FIELD WHERE THEY WERE CUTTING THE CORN. EVERYONE WAS CHASING RABBITS, AND THEN WE HAD OUR TEA IN THE HARVEST FIELDS. THE HORSES. YEAH? MM-HMM. THE HORSES BACK THEN, THEY WERE KEPT BEAUTIFULLY. DAD USED TO DRESS THEM ALL UP-- BRASS THINGS AND-- AND LITTLE HORSESHOES. HE'D PUT BRAIDS ON THEM. ( gasps ) THEY USED TO BE GORGEOUS. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR TOMORROW?

Grandmother: THEY'RE GONE, FOR ME. Leonard: JANE? Grandmother: BUT NOT FOR YOU. JANE. YOU KNOW, IT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU. IN SOME WAYS IT'S EASIER. YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE WAR. PEOPLE DON'T DIE AS MUCH AS THEY DID BACK THEN, BUT IN SOME WAYS IT'S MORE DISJOINTED. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE YOUR OWN LIFE, ONE THAT YOU LOVE, AND YOU CAN'T BE AFRAID OF THE... THE TIME. TIME IS SHIFTABLE. THERE ARE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE THAT I WOULD TRADE 60 YEARS TO HAVE BACK AGAIN. THAT'S THE TRUTH. YOU'LL KNOW THE TRUTH WHEN YOU FIND IT. IT'LL COME TO YOU LIKE SOMETHING YOU'VE KNOWN BEFORE RATHER THAN SOMETHING YOU'RE LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME. OH, SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. AHH! BOLLOCKS! WHAT IS IT? ( Leonard groaning ) OHH, YOU FU...!

HAVE YOU? CAN WE NOT? HAVE YOU? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH A LONG TIME TO ANSWER THAT? BECAUSE I'M SICK... OF WHAT, LEONARD? OF IT BEING SO HARD? YES. TEDIOUS? I HATE TALKING ABOUT SEX WITH YOU. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? NORMAL PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SEX, LEONARD. AND WE DON'T? THERE'S JUST HUGE VACANT LOTS THAT WE DON'T DISCUSS. LIKE WHAT? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ASK ME? WHY? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME? I JUST WANNA CONNECT. SO YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WE'RE CONNECTED. DO YOU? I LOVE YOU. I GET IT, LEONARD. I GET IT. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS BIG, SERIOUS, GRAVE THING FOR US. SEX HAS CONSEQUENCES, LIFE AND DEATH, MOSTLY DEATH. JANE, PLEASE. LET ME GUESS. YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU'RE JUST-- DO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN, LEONARD? OF COURSE I DID. NOT "DID." DO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN? SO DID YOU, BUT... SAY IT. JANE. SAY IT. I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN, LEONARD. I NEVER WILL. AND IF WE KEEP TRYING, THEY KEEP DYING. PLEASE, JANE. PLEASE. AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL, LEONARD? HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL? YOU WILL NEVER BE A FATHER. WE CAN ADOPT. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT, IS IT? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? HM?

YOU'RE NOT CURIOUS ABOUT ME, LEONARD. NOT REALLY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO KNOW? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK. I FEEL AS IF YOU WANT ME TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT. SOMEONE THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN. I'M LEAVING YOU. I'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEONE ELSE. SEEING? CALEB. THAT KID? YES. THAT KID, THAT CHILD, THAT KID YOU'VE KNOWN FOR TWO DAYS? IT'S BEEN LONGER THAN THAT. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

( glass shatters; car horn honks outside ) I KEPT WAITING FOR YOU TO SEE IT, TO SMELL IT, TO SENSE IT! SO, WHAT? I FAILED YOUR TEST? YOU DON'T SEE ME! I'M SORRY. FOR WHAT? I'M SORRY. FOR WHAT? I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. NO. LOSING MY TEMPER. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT... ...TO LOSE YOUR TEMPER. NO, NO, NO, NO. IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER, THEN YOU SHOULD GO. YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A TERRIBLE... TERRIBLE THING, JANE. NO. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. OF COURSE IT IS. YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE, LEONARD. YOU DON'T LOVE ME! THAT'S-- THAT'S RUBBISH. THIS IS YOUR TICKET. THE DAY AFTER MY PERFORMANCE, MEET ME AT THE TRAIN STATION.
