CHANGES directed by Lukasz Barczyk Tadeusz? Turn around. The way they're gathering... I want you. Make love to me! Marta. Marta! - The house's very acoustic. - We don't do it at home, either. Get dressed. Who is it? Snaut. I was due tomorrow. Wanda's asleep. Sure. I can go to a hotel and come back in the morning. Excuse me. - Marta Myci√±ska. - Nice to meet you. Have you got matches? Follow me, but be careful, the house's very acoustic. It's here. Goodnight. Goodnight. It's me. I came earlier. I couldn't wait to get into your sleepy pussy. I've missed your juices. - What time does he get up? - When he's had enough sleep. Did he get a divorce? - Aren't you afraid? - I am. Of what? Of nothing. - Don't be ashamed. - Why shouldn't she be? - There's nothing to be ashamed of. - Strip then. We shouldn't be ashamed around your guy? You should. Basia? Snaut. Ostrowska. - It's beautiful here. - I can't see that. - Good morning! - Morning. - Wanda's been telling me about you. - That's nice. - Really? - Yes, it's nice to be talked about. She told me about your failed marriage, your drug problem... - She's worried about this. - Mum... Your own words. I'm being honest with you. So, this is all true? I've never given an account of my life. But today is special. What makes it so special? Meeting you... and Wanda's family. I love her. I want to love you all. I'm sorry, but that's impossible. Nobody's loved around here, except for Alicja. Everybody loves her, which might ruin her life. Are the apples collected yet? No. I haven't even started, Mum. Tadeusz, Marta's husband. Soon, you'll want to get away. The smartest thing to do. But since you're a bad loser, you'll decide to stay. And that'll kill you. Snaut. I know. There's been rumours about a junkie coming. Very funny. - We could leave right away. - No, it's all right. Wanda, don't overreact. We won't harm Adrian. We're talking, getting to know each other, like you wanted. Madam, my marriage was a misunderstanding. We had nothing in common. Soon our sex-life was over, we cheated... Constant stress made us aggressive. We talked only when we argued. And since we have a child, we couldn't prolong that situation. We got divorced. I'd really love to... I wouldn't like you to judge my life. Why are you so silent? I'm impressed. You don't know us. But when you know more of us and of the tragedies we've had here, - you'll understand my cautiousness. - I know some things. - Such as? - Your husband left you for another, and then died in a car crash killing two other people. You've become bossy and reserved. You have fury attacks. You've dominated your daughters, you beat and humiliate them. On some days fear makes you stay in your room. He's offending you! How dare you? - I don't understand. - Talking to my Mother like that! You're... impudent! I didn't mean to offend you. Just... We want to get married, I came to ask you for approval. You don't need my approval. It's nice that you're asking for it, though. Stay for a few days and you'll know my opinion. - I'd like to observe you two. - Wanda! Wanda... - I overdid it, huh? - Yes! You're not treating this seriously. You're not treating us seriously. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... It's all right. They provoked me. They can't stand me being happier than they are. They envy me for having you, for loving you. They hate me for that. That's not true. They care about you, they don't want you to make a mistake. I can understand them. Thank you for saying this. You're wonderful. The wisest man on Earth. What do you do for a living? I'm unemployed. You're joking? No. Hasn't Wanda told you? - She said you worked together. - We used to. I was addicted and had to undergo therapy. They fired you? Yes. - But you're normal now? - Mum! What? Why the long faces? Somebody died? Good afternoon. Excuse me. - Want a dumpling? - Yeah. I'll go then. One more? - Here. - Thank you. It's Tadeusz's? Yeah. - You looked weird yesterday. - Weird? In what way? I don't know... unpleasant. You'd been crying. Maybe you didn't see well. Is it better now? - I hadn't been crying. - It was dark, maybe I was wrong. Will you manage on your own? Yes. I was tactless. Forgive me. Are you angry with me... for them having treated you like that? I don't give a damn if they accept me or not. Don't say that. I care about it. You won't marry me because you care about your family? That's not true. Make love to me. Not now. - Why? - Because. - The house's acoustic. - Last night it wasn't a problem. - It wasn't a problem last night. - But it is one today. I don't want to make love now, get it? Relax your legs. You're not asleep? You two won't let one sleep. What's that? Insulin. I didn't know. Now you do. Don't stand here naked, I don't like it. I'm sorry. Want to go swimming? Yes. - How do you feel? - Great. - And how do you feel at our house? - Bad, of course. Why "of course"? You'll learn. Mother and I are transparent. - That's a lie. - Why? You're not sincere. Hi. Good morning. Hi. - Been swimming? - Yeah. The water is wonderful. It's cold. You'll get cramps and drown. Basia kept guard. - Wanda's up? - No, Alicja's with her. Everybody's up. Keep them company. - I want to sit with Alicja. - What's your problem? - I just want to stay with the kid. - Have you been to Australia? No. Excuse me. Oops, I soiled your sweater, sir. Sir? Snaut. That's a last name? Sounds strange. Strange. I feel like a stranger. Will you be staying long? Until your Mum passes the verdict. Why doesn't he do anything? Who? Tadeusz. How do you know he doesn't? He's absent-minded and nobody likes him. I like him. I won't discuss my husband with you. He isn't your husband, you don't love him. When did you last make love? When did you two do it? Marta! What happened? Nothing. Have you seen my file? What's wrong? Nothing. Snaut's been talking about experiments on animals. Come, darling. Don't eat the moons, they're for her. You like the moons? Thank you! What's with the renovation? What do you mean? That's a good question, Tadeusz. Your health, Mum. To the renovation. You'll wash up. That's not a man's job. A man is something more than his penis. You really think so? - Basia. - Yes, Mum? Check your sugar. I'm telling the truth, not having symptoms. - Calm down. - I'm calm, don't shout. I'll collect those bloody apples. I feel as if I knew you well. You don't know me at all. - Have you been together long? - Do you always pry? No. It's my first time. I love him very much and we are very happy. I feel safe and calm around him. I don't believe you. You're pissing me off, sir. I don't know what you want, but I think you're dangerous. I'm glad you'll never decide about my life. What are you doing? We're working. - On what? - Measuring, weighing, counting. It's time for your bath. - No, please. - It's time. The adults want to talk, so kids should go to bed. You're stupid. In that case, you're showing off. - One more comment and you'll see. - I am sorry, Mum. - Do you want me to help you? - No. Yo-ho-ho. What an imagination. She's been telling me about her dolls. What did she say? That Halinka is Dorotka's Mummy. They share their husband, Mr Wojtek who uses mining tunnels to transport coal to Africa. I don't trust you. - You'll take advantage of Wanda. - Why? Are you enjoying your stay? Is it vacation time for you? May I ask you a question? - No. - Tough luck. - What makes you behave like that? - Insight. - Or is it soreness? - No. I don't think so. Who is Alicja's father? - I'm her mother, that's enough. - For you, maybe. What do you want from us? I want to be with Wanda. To have a home and kids. Take care of the one you have. - You'll make her suffer. - Stop it. Stop it? You wanted to talk. Talk. - How do I know you won't fail again? - You won't know. You hate men because one of them made you pregnant and run off. It fucked up your head. You don't know a shit about it. Oh, yeah? I do know. It's all written on your face. It's the same with all women here. Only Marta doesn't know a thing, for you're all bullshitting her. You will be... You'll suffer the worst from what you're up to. You want to destroy her. Her and my entire family. You want to conflict us. You're full of shit. You're nobody. I hate you. I've known such arseholes. Smiling, happy... They'll always buy their way out, and then... No, you won't dump her. She will leave you, you egoistic bastard. Marta! Coke! You fucking shithead! You insane fucker! What is it, darling? My angel, what's wrong? Calm down. He wants to destroy her. He tells me I'm a bad mother. Just because I don't have a... Look, how he's staring. He wants to screw us. You, Marta, all of us. He wants to screw us. Mum, he wants to ridicule us, he wants to cheat us, he wants... Calm down, my precious. Calm down, take a drink. - It's a diabetic crisis. - Basia, drink some coke. I don't want to drink. - Please... - No! I don't want to! - Take hold of yourself! - Why did you bring him here? - Wanda, sugar! - To get laid? To fuck him, huh? - To fuck and bear him babies? - Sugar! To have babies? Under the arms... - Stop it! - I hate you! You've made me your servant! You make me sick, you whore! Give her coke! Drink! Basia, stop. Mum! My daughter! You took away... Mummy, give me back... - A sip. - Give me back my child. We will. Alicja, Mummy is calm. Mummy is... perfectly calm. Just don't... Don't touch those people! Basia, stop! - Please, drink. - No, I won't drink. Nothing that comes from you. - Mummy... drink. - What, honey? Drink? You're telling Mummy what to do? Why aren't you in bed? Why isn't she...? To bed! Wanda, take the child! Calm down! To bed! - Bloody hell! - I'll give her more. Have some sugar, Basia! Have some sugar. Give me the coke! - Wanda, call an ambulance! - Put her on her side. - Wanda, an ambulance! - Open the window! Relax. Wait a moment. Calm down. Calm down! - Please. - Basia... The doctor's on his way. - It's all right... relax. - Breathe... slowly, slowly. My darling... My darling... My darling... She's had a heart attack. They can't say anything yet. Why are you touching me? Don't! What did you tell her? Did you treat her like me? Did you hit her where she hurts? My treasure, come. Go to bed. Hop in. Straighten your legs. My treasure. My little creature. You come here, too. What? What? Is Mummy going to die? Mummy is gone. She loves you very much and wants you to know that you have to be brave, and strong... And that everybody will take care of you and love you... And that Mummy is with you and is watching you but in a different way. I am scared. Why are you avoiding me? I'm not. - It wasn't my fault. - I know. Just leave and get married. - Is that what you want? - Yes. Hi! Hi, Adrian. Hello. Hello, darling. Here you are: A vase, and its contents. Dinner is nearly ready. Open the wine, honey. Have you got cold mineral water? Yes! Super. Can I look around? Go ahead, but it's still a mess. Would you help us getting it decorated? Yeah, sure. A king-size bed! Buddy, what do you two do here? Somersaults? - We sleep across the bed. - Across... nice. Super. And here? - And here is... - May I? Sure. This will be Adrian's study. Lots of books. Okay, and what about the future? You should get married and make yourself a baby. Don't mention that subject. - Why? - You're not allowed. Why am I not allowed? You don't want kids, so leave the topic. Is there a problem? No, none. No, there's no problem, he just doesn't sleep with me. - Are you going to argue? - They're not arguing. Let's sit and talk about it. Families should discuss such issues. - There's no issue. - Yes, there is. We haven't been able to talk at home, why not talk here? Why don't you respect me? Or do you think my stupidity will let you hide what you did? What did I do? What? You made a baby. You got my sister pregnant. What are you talking about? What? You thought I'd never find out? You really think I'm so stupid? You knew, too. You were all lying to me. - Motherfucker, I'll never forgive you. - What? You think I learned it through him? Another one to blame? Sure, you're innocent, he screwed up your life. Maybe he killed Basia, too? Know what killed her? Lies. - You'll regret those words. - I'm not afraid anymore. I knew it all along, waiting for someone to fucking tell me! - Blame him! - But you are my sister! Do you understand what it means? Do you? Why should I talk to him? He didn't show me how to kiss boys. He didn't comfort me when I'd had enough of my fucking marriage! Why are you so silent? If you don't know what to say, smoke a cigarette and think. I'm sorry you've entered such a messed-up family. Marta... Forgive me. Forgive me. What? Everything. But... Be specific. What should I forgive you? Forgive me for having cheated on you with Basia... for the baby we had. You have. I have. That's it. That's all, huh? You idiot. I forgave you for that long ago. Could I live with you and them if I hadn't forgiven? But I can't forgive you for lying. For thinking nothing of me. Who lies, disappears. You're not there. I'm going to wait for 5 minutes, then I'll go home. Excuse me. I'll go with her. Marta! Jesus! Do you want a divorce? No. Why not? It doesn't make any difference to me. You detest me. No. I'm so ashamed. - Go, you make me sick. - What should I do now? I don't know, it's your life. And you? I won't thrive on your fear. It does nothing to me. Go. Go! Don't yell at me. You won't cope without me. It won't be easy. It will be normal life, Life you've always shunned. Well then? You're not so tough. Think you can take advantage of my guilt? No fucking way. 5 years are enough. You want to leave? Go ahead. But think of the future. Something's happened? You sounded upset on the phone. No, everything's fine. I wanted to phone earlier, but I didn't dare. Why? I want you. If that's a joke, it's not funny. There's nothing wrong in mutual attraction. - There is. We should fight it. - I don't want to fight. I want you. Where are we going? - Out of town. - Stop it. I'll tie you to a tree and rape you. - Do you feel all right? - Do you? No, let's get back. No. Help me. I want to feel. - What? - You. - But I don't want it. - You do. - I won't act against your will. - I know. Are you coming? Can one have some tea here? One can. There's a kettle, there's tea, there's everything. Can one get warm here? No. We will make love with our clothes on. If we were to make love, we should be in love. In that case we'll have a fuck. You want to humiliate me? No. Finally, you are helpless. Finally, it is like you always wished it to be. Finally, you're weak. I love you. When did this happen? A month ago. Are you sure it's his? Yes. I haven't had sex with Tadeusz for over a year. Do you want to keep it? I hate you both. He's scum. No, he isn't. I love him. I thought I did, too. I even brought him home. What a lucky strike, huh? Very. Why are you laughing? It's a Brazilian soap-opera. Does he know? Yes. I want to talk to him alone, all right? Go. You can have him. I am sorry. I don't give a fuck. I need some time alone anyway. I'll think it all over, take a look in the mirror... I'll look at the wrinkles around the eyes, I'll figure out what I really want. Wanda, you have no wrinkles. I have. You too. Take a look. We're old. You're exaggerating. I'm beginning to have stretch marks, cellulite. I'll be alone. That's all right, I like being on my own. Maybe that's what I want. And you? What do you want? To be able to trust somebody. You can trust me. Not anymore. You can. Now you can, we're even. Do you really think about it this way? I have to breathe... I'll breathe and then I'll go to bed. But I won't be able to sleep, I don't want to be alone. Stay with me, please. No. Whatever's happened to you, my little sis? I've grown up. Marta? Let's leave. Now. I am ready. I am... Marta... Who have you brought here? I had no idea, Mum. About what? What he was like. And what is he like? He seduced you. Otherwise I'd have to eliminate you from my life. Do it. Shame on you! I'm sorry. - I'll have this baby. - You'll get rid of it! Have you heard? You'll get rid of it! And you'll never see him again. Same applies to you. He won't see any of you again. I cannot forgive you. And I'm not asking you to. I'd do it again. He'll destroy you. He won't. It's all my fault. I know what I'm saying. It's my fault. You don't know what you're saying. Your words are meaningless. They aren't. You won't remember anything tomorrow. THE END
