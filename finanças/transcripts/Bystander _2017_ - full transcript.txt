Good evening. We're interrupting your programming tonight to report to you live from city hall in the disappearance of Chief Braddock, who we are just being told has now been missing for 17 hours. It has not been confirmed, but a source inside reported another live feed was just posted privately for the police. The Checkmate killer has not yet claimed responsibility, but we have reason to believe he may have taken his highest profile target yet. Every officer in the city, along with the FBI, is working tirelessly to find him. However at this time we have no word on the chief's whereabouts. Hi, Chief. You're a dead man. The checkmate killer? He's nothing but a repulsive coward. He should come out and meet me like a man. We're gonna hang you for this, fucker. Yeah. Well not just for this. Who do you work for? Fuck you. Ah. White knight takes black king. I don't work for him. It's not for him. It's for me. I need a permanent solution, but it can't get back to me. It's gone in two days. I didn't wanna ask this of ya, but I need someone with your abilities to rattle their bones. 20% is yours when the job is complete. Plus double your usual signing bonus, which is in there. I'll be needing access to your inside people. It's in there. Complete list of contacts. I'll make sure they know to expect your instructions. Yes. Of course I understand. I just want it out of my hands in 24 hours. Good. Thank you. Ah. You okay? Yeah, just some crap. I've been trying to get those confiscated funds back to the FBI for months now, and some asshole bureaucrat keeps middling. What are you gonna do? Same shit, different day. Have a seat. What's up? We found another young girl in zone four today. Bullet to the head. We managed to keep it from the press, but there was another note. It read white knight takes pawn six. Mind your path. The lab rats think it's a copycat, but we haven't seen a reference to the white knight since Braddock's murder. Well, didn't we find another note two days ago? Yes, sir. Male's victim's body we found on the north shore. Jeff Walters. Another bullet to the head. Another reference to the white knights. A white knight takes... A white knight takes King's Bishop. Thank you, yes. The handwriting doesn't even match any prior samples we have of Checkmate's handwriting. What do you think, Markou? I don't know. The notes could be in connection to those murders. Could also just a connection with those girls. Walsh? Both the girls had a mark, some stamp. Nothing permit though. We'll figure it out. Use whatever resources you need. I'm meeting with the mayor here in a few hours. Where the hell is my phone? Ugh. I'll take the lead on Walters and the notes. Sounds good. I'll take the girls. Good. If the mayor approves this taskforce, we're gonna be partnering with the FBI. They'll have high level, but we get to make our own calls. Okay. What do you think of this picture? You make a pretty lady. I think it's handsome, but get to work. Thank you. Are you kidding me? Where's my charger? Pardon me. Been here since you, sir? Yeah, it's the Chief's daughter Katie Masters. Okay. I know. Coffee? Yeah. Coffee. Yeah what? No, would you like some coffee? Oh God. I'm sorry. Oh yeah. Sorry, I thought you said Katie. I got that. Lieutenant Markou. Katie Masters. Nice to meet you. I know. So what do you think? What do you think? I think this was a statement. Someone saying back off. Nice meeting you, Katie. Let me know if you see anything. It's time, sir. You realize what you're asking. Yeah, I know Jack, but listen, we've been pushing our commitment to this cause hard and publicly. We shook the tree. The girl this morning is the second in less than a week. Now are we gonna let this continue or are we gonna take charge and say no? You saw what happened to Chief Braddock. Checkmate had nothing to do with human trafficking. Jack, we have to do this. Okay, let's go with it. Thank you, sir. Thanks Jack. How's it going? Oh, good. Hey, so this symbol, do you know what it means? I think it's like a calling card like a mark you can wash off. You know, if Maradona. What? What are you doing? I'm sorry. You were about to ask about Maradona. Yeah. Okay. I'll help you. Just please be careful. I can take care of myself. I'm the chief's daughter. Not my first rodeo. It's not to scare you. I'm just looking out. I appreciate that, but I'm just a photographer. We both know you're much more than that. Look, for what it's worth like I said I'm going to help you, but please just be smart. You never know who's watching you. I will. Nick Cueno. Hey, it's Katie. Hey Katie. How was the stop? Interesting. The girl had a fresh mark on her arm. The same mark as from the girl from a few days ago. You saying she was targeted. I'm not sure. I talked to an officer and he said her murder could have been a statement that it could have been telling the police to back off. And then he cautioned me about digging into Maradona. Well, we can't assume it's Maradona. True, but who else could it be? What else did he say? He said that I shouldn't trust anyone and that I need to stop digging into this. I don't know. He was kinda encrypted. Katie, you know, this means he has police or others on his side, right? Yeah, I get it. I know. Can you meet me at WingHarts? The cop bar? We've gotta start somewhere. Okay. Okay. Give me like 30. Okay. Daddy, where are you? Oh God. Oh hey, sorry Katie. You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Take your time. - Okay. - Yeah. Thanks. Knows who he is but the Maradona has been associated with this sketch provided by the only eyewitness to come forward. A man resembling this sketch is allegedly in charge of trafficking operations. If you recognize this sketch or have seen, just call the number. Here you go. Thanks. On the north shore we have confirmed the identity of the body that washed ashore last night as Jeff Walters. He also died of a gunshot wound to the head. Police are not yet willing to confirm whether or not these murders are connected. Yeah, I was running through here like I do every morning and I looked up at the point. There he was. Whoa. Ran into a movie scene or something. Gotta go. Can you give me the check? Oh, it's okay. Thanks. A tall, white male approximately five foot eight in a tee shirt and boots. No. Go, go, go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Calm down, calm down. - Help us, help us, help us. What's wrong? Help us, please. What's wrong? Yeah. North shore somewhere. Copy that. Dre and Davis are closest. Rich is in the Mexican war district. Send them all now. Understood. Two dead men positioned on Federal and Isabella. Roger that. Prospect sighting up north. Roger. They ran down there, hurry. Where, where? Down there. This is 3612 daylight. Officer down. Shots fired. Suspect heading northeast stop 28 on foot. He has a gun. Please stop. You okay? No. Katie. You okay? No, no. Someone just tried to kidnap me. Wasn't me. No, back there. Okay, come with me. I'll get both of you to the station. Your dad is there. Wait. What precinct are you with? What? What precinct? One. Look, let's talk in the car. We're not safe here. No. Thanks. How'd you know? He didn't call it in and he knew my name. The other officers back there didn't. 107112. Last sighting heading north towards 10 Street bridge. What are you doing? Something else. 187 1053 heading down on 12th. 10 four. 1045. What are you doing? He's a real cop. Some gunshot wounds on the side. A man with a woman shot the officers and ran down the pier dragging the woman. They just said you killed cops. Why are they saying that? I don't know. Why are cops trying to kidnap you? I don't know. My father, he's Chief Masters. I've been trying to call him all day and he's not answering. And there's this cop this afternoon. He came up to me and he was trying. No, don't do that. Whoever it is will find out where we are. It's exactly what they want. Hop in. No, these cars are low jacked. We can't do that. We gotta find another way. Are you surprised? What are you doing? I asked you a question. Ditch your phone. Shit. For those of you just joining us, we have reports of an attempted kidnapping. Followed her out of the bar. Stopped on the corner and then sprint in the same direction she went. I was standing here. He was over there. Pale, red hair. It was on take off. Then I heard a girl scream. Then I heard gunshots, then I went back in the bar. Catherine. Catherine. Pittsburgh P.D. It's Officer Langdon. Yes, sir. Are you still at her place? Yeah, nothing here. They got away. Stay there. Understood. And if they show? Don't engage. Hide if you have to. What the hell? There's no place to hide. There's always a place. Where wouldn't you look? Yeah. This is not going to work. Just do it. It's a tiny apartment. I don't care. Figure something out. Okay. And send me the address. Yes, sir. I'll be there soon. Sorry. We have to get to the police somehow. Why? So they can try and kill us again? I know officers. They could help. You heard them. They think we're cop killers. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What happened? I really don't know. I was. There was this officer. I was at this crime scene. I'm a photographer for the paper in town and I was trying to call my dad and he wouldn't answer. And then my boss was supposed to pick me up. And I don't know. You think photographs caused this? I don't know. There was this detective and he warned me about asking questions about Maradona. He practically threatened me. Who? Gioffre Markou. No, no, he's a good guy. I don't know. I'll vouch. He's one of my best friends. He's clean. No. Well maybe he was just trying to help. Maybe it was the pictures. Maybe it was your dad. My camera. My camera. I automatically downloads everything to my laptop. We can go get it. It's like 10 blocks away from here at my apartment. We could go get the... No, no. You know that's the first place they'll look for you. It's all we have. That's the dumbest thing we could do. No, no. Ugh. Son of a bitch. 10 four. 2357 daylight, please use the proper codes. 10 four, dispatch. 10 four. 1158. I repeat, 1158. 10 four. Yeah. One of your guys is down. Witnesses saw a guy and a girl shoot. Cherry. Understood. Hey, hey. Let go of me. Let go of me. Stop it. Why are you following me? A cop just tried to kill us. Why are cops trying to kill us? Thank you for saving me, but I'm going up there. You can do whatever you want. What? What's wrong? This is my floor. How was I supposed to know that? What? You really want me to go first? Wait, wait, wait. We should go. We should go now. Why? What? What? Wait, you live like this? Oh my God. I'm Kyle by the way. Katie. I know. Wait, I know you. You're Chief Braddock's son, aren't you? Whoa. What? - What's wrong? - Sh. Don't shush me. Are you okay? Is he dead? He's. Okay. Oh my God. All right, all right. Let's go. Oh shit. Kou. Footage from the bar is uploading now. We just received a 911 call. Shots fired at Katie Masters apartment complex. Colts and Brady are first on the scene. Where you been? I just came from the Chief's. He's not good. Pittsburgh P.D. Hand's up. I'm Katie Masters. Against the wall now. Against the wall. I'm the chief's daughter. Quiet. He didn't identify himself. Quiet. Dispatch, this is Officer Saul. We have a possible homicide. 300 Hind Street. I shot him in self defense. Who is there with him? Oh shit. Sir, we lost contact. What's going on? What happened? Let me know what's in that footage. Wait. What? Why are we stopping? - Hang on. - What? No. No. Please no, no. No, no. They know it's Katie Masters. Do they know who's helping her? No, they think he actually helped kidnap her. Change in plans. Don't kill him. Find out who he is. You okay? Who is that guy back there? I don't know. I recognized the older guy. I don't know his name, but I know he's a cop. All right, let's go. Can we clear the crime scene, please? Cassie and Murphy only. Found this. White knight takes black queen. Check. What? You know your hovering isn't going to help. I'm thinking. Think somewhere else. Jesus. Kou says that she's with Kyle Braddock. No way. No. I don't know, Cassie. Call dickhead. Calling dickhead. I mean, seriously. He kidnaps the girl and then kills six cops. That's Kyle's phone. Did Katie know him? He. You know that doesn't really prove Kyle did it. Why would they come back to this apartment? I don't know. She escaped and came home. No, that doesn't work. Forensic specialist. Don't even say it. Eyes on 16th Street Bridge. Who are you? I got you. I got you. A little closer. There you are. Walsh. I got something for you. Did Kyle really kidnap my daughter? You heard already? Sir, who would want to do this? Who wouldn't? What if it is just Kyle? He hasn't been right in the head since his father's death. Nah. I gotta get this. Hey. Have you seen the guy? Hello? No. No. Who is he? I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. He's the driver of the car. He could be the ringleader. Car's registered to Nick Cueno. It's Katie's boss. He's missing. Okay, keep digging. If I must. Do you know this man? No, who is he? We don't know yet. FBI is on their way. We think he could work for Maradona. No, no, no, no, no, he wouldn't. She was last seen this morning photographing the crime scene and now her boss is missing. What better way to get back at the man who's leading charge against sex trafficking then to kidnap his daughter. Tom. Six cops are dead. I want my daughter back. You do what you have to do. I'll handle the FBI. I'll sort it out later. Wait, wait. Just hold on. No one's following us. I'm sorry. The bag. Where's the bag? You were supposed to grab it. I was supposed to grab it? Yeah, you're the last one in there. You had it in your hand. The only reason we went up there was for that laptop and you left it up there. Just stop yelling at me for one second. Let me just think. Pictures. There was a mark on this girl's arm and it was like it was in a circle. It was waves in a circle on her wrist. Like. Like three? - Like three marks? - Yeah. Yeah. How did you know that? Do I really have to regain your trust every 15 minutes? I'm sorry. I have no idea what's going on. Oh shit. Answer that when I call or she dies. Why are you trying to hurt me? No, what are you doing? Why, why do you wanna hurt me? Did I stutter? Maybe they didn't have time. It's just a feeling. I don't know. There's no strange activity on their bank accounts. Okay. Okay then. You okay over there? Did they feed you? What is it? Cherry and Langdon never reported in. Langdon was off duty. Well maybe he left to help. Nah, they know the protocol. They should have called in. Colts and his partner were good. Cassie confirmed they were on the ground when shot. What are you saying, Tom? Are you saying my officers are on the take? I don't think Kyle has it in him. Listen to me. Just because he's Braddock's kid, don't let that cloud your judgment. Sir. Katie. Hello? Who is this? Well now, that's insulting. I thought we were partners. Partners? Are you insane? That seems to be the general consensus here. Who are you? Where's my daughter? What do you want you son of a bitch? Hey. Partners don't talk that way. Stop saying that. I'm not your goddamn partner. Of course we are. I made you chief. I see from the expression on your face you remember me. Do what I say without deviation or Kyle tosses Katie into the river. Wait by the phone. You'll receive further instructions soon. Send those files to Markou now. Sweep the house for bugs. Dammit. Hey, are you back yet? All right, I'm sending you a file now. When you get back, run the voice against our Checkmate records. Yeah. Tom. Hey. It may not be him. Tom, that madman has my daughter. The FBI is in charge. Let them handle this. Hello. Kyle Braddock. Who is this? Do as I say and I give you my word, Katie will be unharmed. How do I know you haven't hurt her already? I haven't, but I will hurt her in the most horrid, gut wrenching ways you could imagine if you don't do as I ask. I want proof she's alive. - I - drugged her, Kyle. She's unconscious. I'm not doing anything until I know she's... Stop talking, Kyle or I'll kill her and I'll let the police kill you. Don't forget. They think you're a cop killer who kidnapped the chief's daughter. They don't know about me. They think this is all you. You're going to retrieve something I need. In exchange, you'll get Katie back alive. What? Chief Masters' laptop. What? It's in his office. How the hell am I supposed to do that? You'll figure it out. You have until 0600 hours to bring it to me. You just said it. Every cop in this city is looking for me. Exactly. Nobody will look there. That phone is bugged. We're tracking you. If you tamper with it or call anyone outside of this number, I'll know and I will hurt Katie. I promise you that. Kyle, you want to do this for me. Why is that? Because the white knight just took your queen. Check. They found Nick Cueno's body in a dumpster downtown. The note read white knight takes queen's rook. Where is everybody? I sent 'em home. What? I don't want 'em here. What is it? We found Kyle's DNA at the crime scene last year. We didn't think twice about it because he's his son. Kyle's not Checkmate, sir. I know that. He's a superb medical examiner. He wouldn't be able to manipulate our evidence. I just want you to prove me wrong. What am I gonna do, Tom? Oh, Christ, Catherine. You okay here while I follow this? Go. I'm calling the FBI. Let them know you're here alone. I don't like this. There are agents in the street. I'll call you if he calls again. And Tom. If you find Kyle and he resists, are you prepared to protect my daughter? You know you never have to ask me that question. Are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. I have no interest in harming your daughter. You already have. That sting of yours was something. How'd you get him to talk? Right here. It's where he hit his head. Well that number Checkmate used came up as a dead end. It was a burn phone. Cassie Fucifino. I didn't kidnap Katie. Those cops tried to kill us. Oh yeah? What about the two you killed in Katie's apartment? That was an accident. You accidentally shot them repeatedly while they were on the ground? Whoa, no. I didn't shoot them at all, Cass. Then why did you confess to Colts that you did? I want to come in, but I don't want to get shot. Sounds difficult. RFE one hour. He called from that number. What'd he say? He's innocent and he wants to come in. Do you believe him? Do you? Hello? What's taking so long, Kyle? Get to the station now. Whatever, man. You don't know who's clean and who I pay on the force. Remember that. Katie, wake up. Ah. Stop it. Hurry up, Kyle. Stop it, please. You win. Just please stop hurting her. Call me when you arrive. Hello. Stay put. I'll come when I know you weren't followed. Dick. Thanks. Thank you, Cass. You okay? Yeah, why? You two were close. You seem to be handling it better than Cassie. You never really know what someone's made of until you've seen them at their worst. Whoever killed Jeff Walters is controlling Kyle. It doesn't make sense. Sure it does. Super nice forensic analyst is now a cop killer who kidnapped the new chief's daughter for the serial killer who killed our old chief who's now the local kingpin of sex trafficking. Case closed. I should get a medal. So you're saying we're being played. Anything missing from her place? Her place was torn apart. Why would she tear her own place up? Someone went there looking for something and tore it up. What's she into? Maybe she's just lazy and lives like that. You haven't seen my place. What is it? Maradona's been slipping up all of a sudden. Checkmate referred to the chief as his partner. I bet that ruffled his feathers. He sent everyone home. Told the FBI to watch from the street. Chief's not involved. Of course not. See, this is what this douchebag wants. He wants us questioning everything. Let's just keep it simple. We find Kyle, we'll find him. This is getting out of hand. What the hell is the matter with you? Why did you drop that bitch? You know you're supposed to divert attention away, not put me on a damn front page. I'm getting tired of your shit. You're just turning into some little psychotic. Let me know when you get the rest of the money. Hello? Why are you making me do this? Stop stalling. I mean, you orchestrated this fantastically. Why do you want the laptop? I don't need my ego stroked. You're wasting time. If you fail, she dies and I disappear forever. You'll rot in prison unless that's... Okay, okay. I'm going in. Good. Chief. Really? Goddammit. You shit eating dickhead. All clear. Dammit. I'm in. Really? Yes. Good job. Grab the laptop. Kyle. I didn't say break into the laptop. I'm looking for a laptop case. Kyle. Hang on. I gotta find something to carry this in. Kyle. Get down on the ground. Kill him, Kyle. Get out of there. Get down on the ground now. No. He'll kill her if you don't let me go. Kyle, put me on speaker. Okay, Checkmate. Officer, I have a knife to Katie Masters' throat. Drop the gun and kick it to Kyle or she dies. Five. Four. Three. Okay, okay. Don't hurt her. Kyle, grab the gun. Okay. Shoot him. Three. Two. One. That's it. What the hell? Copy that. The station is on lockdown. Suspect last sighted on Ross and Fourth. Detective Murphy is in pursuit. I repeat Detective in pursuit. This is 3612 daylight. I'm here on foot. They're headed to Market Square. Close off Liberty and Boulevard. This is Irizarry. I'm on Fourth and Smithfield. No sign of suspect. Which way? Do you have any idea where the suspect is? Kyle Braddock. I repeat Kyle Braddock. 10 four. 1159. 10 four. Does anyone have eyes on the suspect? The Point. He's headed for the docks. Sorry. Sorry. Oh shit. Kyle. Is she alive? Yeah. It's not there. Back to plan A. Copy that. Kyle's on his way here. He's expecting a trade for Katie. Understood. Well, looks like I still need you. Walsh just texted. We lost him. Hey, great job letting him slip away, asshole. Jesus. You look way shittier than your usual. Why would he come here? How the hell should I know? If it was me, I'd be on my way to some country without extradition. Mai Tai's. Nude beaches. He's trying to save her. You sure? I just don't know anymore. Jesus. I'm just tired and I haven't eaten. Go home. No, I'm good. Night watch guy. He was dead at least an hour before Kyle stole my badge. Security footage has been deleted. Same with the backup server. He really is innocent. You can't tell from the video, but if you watch it about 10,000 times, you see this guy fall back and a small device fall down to the ground. That's Kyle's phone. He didn't run into kidnap her. He ran into save her. He also stopped into appreciate the art. The feds just found Maradona and Kravitz dead down by The Point. Murdered execution style. Was there a note? They text it to me. White knight overthrows white king and white king's bishop. White knight expels all pawns and is now king. Holy shit. Jesus. I'll be in the lab. It's also a list of names. Politicians and officers all on the take including the chief. Shit. Yeah, Cass. Tom, Checkmate's dead. The blood on the wall at WingHart's didn't match any we'd found in the past. I ran across a photo of Jeff Walters. He had a tattoo of a queen on his arm. Never thought of it before because it was an actual queen, not you know the piece. Anyway, I compared Walter's DNA to old samples we found on Checkmate's victims and it matched three. He was Checkmate. Good work, Cass. New guy's a poser. This is bullshit. What? Say it. He's all alone. You said it yourself. He kicked everyone out. You don't think that's weird? So what? FBI's there. Did you see them? Like I'm not saying. His daughter, man. Just like you said. It's exactly what he wanted. Us chasing our tails and going after each other. Look, security was compromised. We've been running all over the place away from here thinking this is about trafficking. This isn't about Kyle or Katie or any of us. This is about a goddamn heist. Wait a minute. Evidence was cleared. It's not down there. Where is it? I don't know. Who does? You stay on Kyle and Katie. If you call it in, she dies. I got this. Dispatch. Hi, this is Lieutenant Markou. Can I get a trace on Lieutenant Walsh's phone please? Route it to my mobile. Of course, Detective. Great. Dispatch. Yeah, this is Lieutenant Markou again. I need a vehicle report on Detective Murphy. Absolutely, Detective Markou. Thank you. Jeff Walters was Checkmate. It's the body that washed ashore a few days ago. We found Maradona and Senator Kravitz murdered down by the point last night. No suspects yet, but whoever did it left a list of names. Politicians, police officers all on Maradona's dime. Your name was on that list. Good job. Oh yeah. Kyle is innocent. Markou has proof. Katie. Murphy? How could you work for Checkmate? Wake up, Kyle, there's no Checkmate. There never was. The computer now. No. Quiet. Where is she? I thought that was her. Murph said Checkmate wasn't real. Maradona created Checkmate as a cover. There are many Checkmates. They're all hiding organized hits. Where we going? Find Katie. Well. Here we are. Good. Let's go. Sorry, Chief. Thought it was all accounted for. No sweat, Rudy. You know. You told me to not even stop for you, sir. I know. Thanks. It's cool, I got it. No. Dammit. Jesus Christ. Your batch will be there. Why don't we just take his car? Try to trap me again and Katie dies. What do you need me for? Just let her go. You think I don't know they're are tracers in those bags? You think I don't know that that's only half the shipment? Katie. Get the bag. You know what? Half is enough. Katie. Katie, Katie. Katie. Honey. Katie. Dad. Oh, I am so sorry. Ambulance is on the way, hun. All good. She's okay. She is. You guys okay? Yeah, we're good. I hurt you though. I only had a few seconds to think. They took Katie as leverage for the funds and then we realized... Got it. Never doubted you, Chief. Good work, you too. Kou.
