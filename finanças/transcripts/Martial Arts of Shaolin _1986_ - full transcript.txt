Gate of Mental Cultivation Release the prisoner! - Hold it right there! - I have the royal edict. Release the prisoner! So they have murdered you, my poor friend. - He Suo! - How dare you address me thus! I have the royal pardon! - But you're too late. - Too late? He Suo, the execution was to be held at noon, but you disregarded those orders. Don't you fear the law? - I am the law here. - He Suo, you're not the law, you're an animal! Kill him! Have you made a hole yet? I'll make a hole, no matter how thick it is! Hurry up. If the abbot catches you, there'll be trouble. You're really set on this! It's going to fall! - Where are the parents? - You frightened them off. At least it's calmed you down. Hey, the nest is falling! Be careful, don't drop it! You'll be okay, I'll look after you. The chief monk's coming. Here's a fat one. That should fill your belly. - How could you kill for food? - You're mistaken, master. Don't deny it! I caught you in the act. You said that a fat one would fill your belly, right? We did say that, but we were saving a life not taking it. So killing a bird is saving a life? I would like to see how you do that. Show me. You see, Abbot, they're alive. The nest fell out of a tree and their parents are gone. They'd die of starvation, so we found some nice big, juicy worms for them. It's still killing! Worms are just as much Buddha's creatures as birds. They're both living creatures. But the birds will die if we don't feed them the worms. If we don't save lives, it's a sin. But if we take lives, that's a sin, too. So what do we do now? - Practice time! - We have to practice now. You're so wise, you can handle this. Come back here! What am I to do with this? Sorry, teacher is waiting. Come back here! If we don't save lives, it's a sin. But if we take lives, it's a sin also. Buddha, what shall I do? I'll save the biggest. Zhi Ming, you still wear a foot-bell? - Where have you been? - Saving lives. Stop fooling around. Go and practice! Harder everyone. Go on! - Try to attack me, would you? - But teacher... There's a caterpillar on you. See, I told the truth. - You can't kill it! - It's just a worm. - The abbot said it's murder. - He said that? Practice! Carry on everyone. - You said we mustn't kill it. - Oh yes, I forgot. Sorry. - So the abbot was right? - That's enough! Practice! Now "Dragon in the wind. " - Where is our strength? - In our poles! - Poles in our hands. - Buddha in our hearts. Use your strength! Right, now listen to me. If force comes from here, it won't be strong. The further the pole is from you, the stronger is your force. It can kill, always remember that. This training yard could be a killing ground. Continue! Why does Zhi Ming train so hard? - Miss Si Ma Yan. - What have you learnt? He Suo is planning a big celebration. - Is that so? - Yes. We'll mix with the crowd. This is our chance. Father... Zhi Ming, you've gone crazy! - Ah Wong, are you all right? - Your fists are hard now. I'm sorry. - Why aren't you asleep? - What about you? Me? I can get no rest. The night watch. He's still practicing this late? - He's not practicing. - He's shivering. Teacher! - Teacher, are you ill? - Wha... Are you spying on me? - We thought you were practicing. - I'm unwell, so exercise helps. Incredible! You train so hard, even when sick! - It's very late. Go to bed now. - We'll get you some medicine. We martial artists should be able to take a little pain. Go to bed. - Zhi Ming, let's go. - I must train. - Otherwise we may lose tomorrow. - I'm going to wash. - Hello, brothers. Finished training? - Of course! Very good. Want a bath now? Come on. It's teacher! One, two, three! Brothers, eat as much as you can. Eat as much as you like. Eat plenty. Tomorrow, they'll see just how strong the boxing section are. Zhi Ming! You can't eat all of them! - The more I eat, the stronger I'll be. - What will the others eat? - But, master... - Let the others have some, too. This one's for you. One bun packs a lot of strength. - Does it taste good? - Give the others one! Right! Brothers, tuck into these. - Taste good? - Sure does! The aim of the contest between the boxing and pole schools is to pefect your skill in martial arts. The teams must fight for the writing brush and before the rice runs out, write the character for Buddha on their screen. The side that loses must carry water for fifteen days. If neither side wins, then both will carry water for ten days. Go ahead! Throw it to me! Ah Wong, let me! Look, just in time! We won! We won! We... Thank you for your help, brothers. - Well done. - Teacher, this brush is no good. - You're no good! - But teacher... Putian, Shaolin Temple Zhao Wei! Zhao Wei! Master Fai Ren! Master. - Si Ma Yen has gone to the capital. - The capital? What for? He Suo is celebrating his return to the circles of power. I see. She could get herself killed. She's very stubborn. Nothing will stand between her and revenge. Don't worry, I'll stop her. It's too late. Go to the capital and try to help her there. - I just hope she comes to no harm. - Yes. - Teacher! - You're very late today. Late? I nearly didn't come. - You had trouble? - I lost the contest. I got your message. What's up? - It's important. - What's important? - We have an important task. - That's right. Your kung fu is too basic to help you. Teacher, come and see. Stop. This is sacred ground. What are you up to? We're preparing for the birthday. Your old man's birthday? No, the governor's organizing a celebration. We were chosen to peform a dance in the capital. It's a great honor. But what do you want from me? - Our kung fu isn't good enough. - Show us a few more tricks. - Yeah, go on! - Okay, watch closely. - Whose birthday is it? - Lord He's. The same He Suo who left the court years ago? He's back now, so there's a big celebration. There will be many visiting nobles. I've waited a long time, but you've finally broken cover. I'll kill you! I don't mean you. Fifteen days as a water boy... I'm coming too! That's enough for now. On with the celebrations! Birthday More! More! Lord, I am governor of Hainan. I humbly present a lion dance and wish you long life. Good! Stand aside. Now! It spells "Longevity"! Very good! Excellent. Reward them all. Assassins! Again! We must get away! Arrest them! Close the gates, they mustn't escape! - Let's go! - We can't leave them! Get them! That way! Get him! There! Surround it! Where are you going? Stop struggling! Get them! Let's see you dance. Si Ma Yan, where are you? Have the rest! - Forgive us, sire. - Grown men frightened by firecrackers! So, you two didn't really wish me well, did you? I swear I had no idea those people were assassins. - That's right! - Is that so? - I know that you are assassins. - No, I swear I'm loyal to the court. Shut up! Find the assassins or I'll have your heads. We will. These rebels are all from the south. They won't be able to go far. We'll block the road and seal the city. I'm sure we'll find them easily. - Listen to me. - Sire! Impose martial law. If any of them escape, you're dead! - Look inside. They must be here. - Spread out. Look behind there. There he is! - Are you crazy? - They've gone. Why stay on top of me? - So what? You're not a girl. - Me? Are you trying to pull a trick on me? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Stay away from me! When I see you, everything goes wrong. If you're a coward you shouldn't get involved. - I'm fighting for justice. - Me, too! We may be the same, but we're not partners. Hold on! Tell me your name. - So you can sell me out? - You dare to insult me? - Stupid boy. - Stand back! - You're southern barbarians. - What do you know? - You can't defeat me. - Nor you defeat me. Stop this pointless fighting. - I'm not losing. - Nor me. - Barricade the door. - Break it down! Let's go! - Okay? - It's just a scratch. - Thanks for your help. - Fei Wen sent me. Uncle? We didn't kill the old devil. My men were killed. I should have stayed and fought. As long as we're alive and stick together, there is hope. - He Suo is as clever as a fox. - That's nonsense! If not for you, I'd have killed that guy. - Why do you hate him? - I'm not telling you. - Then shut up! - That's enough! - What should we call you? - I am Din Ling. - Din Ling? - That's a stupid name! - Who are you? - I'm Zhao Wei. This is... - Just call me Si Ma. - Si Ma. Someone's coming. Hurry it up back there. Damn it, our goods can't be kept here for too long. Who were those assassins who tried to kill Lord Suo? - Now the roads are blocked. - This could go on a long time. Hurry up, get a move on. There are roadblocks. What do we do? - Come with me. - Come with you? Come on! - Please spare us! - Keep your head up! Go! - Don't, darling! - You bastards, why hit them? You what? Call us bastards? My goodness, who beat you? You should be ashamed. You can't beat people up. Whose sheep are these? They're mine. You're blocking my way. - Where are you taking them? - I'm taking them home. Everybody's got to be checked. Even the sheep have to be checked? Go ahead and check them. Now, be good sheep. Oh, they're running away. - You stop them! - It's not my fault. They're out of control. - Hold it! - Don't run away! You frightened them. What are you going to do about it? - That's your problem! - Don't try that trick. My dowry depends on those sheep. You've got to pay! Pay me some compensation! Give it to me! Stop laughing! What's so funny? I can't marry without a dowry. You must pay me! Get her out of here! You're all alike, you won't pay up! Stay away from me. Now, just calm down. You're typical men. I hate you! Crazy. Back to work. - You made it. - That was close. - Your idea stank. - What's wrong? You spent all our money on sheep, just to sneak us by a checkpoint. It worked, didn't it? You should be grateful. - What do we do now? - We carry on using the sheep. - Carry on? - That's right. You be the sheep. I'll play the girl. How can you? With those eyebrows and that mouth... - You can do it. - Right, I'll do it. You play a girl? Maybe, but your southern accent is too noticeable. - You're just picking on him! - Leave it. - Hungry? - Yeah. - We have nothing to eat! - Is your head just for show? Why don't you use it to think? Go on, eat it. Go ahead, eat! - No! Next one! - Next one. Let me down, let me down! Officers, control yourselves and kindly let my sheep pass. - No! - My sheep must get to their pasture. Poor sheep, off you go home. Go on! Arrest her! She's really cute! - What are you doing? Let me go! - Hasn't he had enough yet? After him! - To the horses! - Come on, quick. Get going! Go! Come on, get on! Get after them! Finish him! I'm one of you! - Is your arm okay? - I'm fine. What about Zhao Wei? We'll hole up over there. A hut. - Were we followed? - No. Look around. There's no one here. - Stay out of sight, I'll find Wei. - Okay. - Your arm. - I'll fix it, you go ahead. - It's me. - I thought you were a soldier. - So, you've gone AWOL? - AWOL? It's better than running behind you like a sheep. You're not stupid after all. - Where is he? - In the hut. Wait a minute! - No one's after us. - So what is it? I think Si Ma is a bit strange here. You... You touched her? - No, I didn't! - How could you? She's not married and you've sullied her. She's ruined! Nothing happened. We were in the saddle... - That's enough! - I'm innocent. In fact, I'm a monk. Right, a monk who kills people... - I wanted to avenge my parents. - Your parents? Yes, He Suo murdered them. I swore on their grave, I'd spit on his corpse. Yes, we failed, but we'll succeed next time. - Which temple are you from? - I'm Zhi Ming, of North Shaolin Temple. - North Shaolin? - Then we're family. Are we? We're secular students at South Shaolin. Her name is Si Ma Yan. - You want to get home? - Sure, but how can we? All the roads south are blocked. We could try the river. - Right. - Let's go! You'd better change. Come with me. They've managed to run rings around you time after time. They must really be something. - They've gone south. - But we cut off... Fools! I should have you executed for incompetence! Spare us, sire! It seems I am forced to go south myself. I'll see how hard these rebels really are. Prepare my boat! - I found it first! - No, I did! - What? It's mine! - No way, it's mine! Hey, stop arguing. You've had a long day, you should rest. Have you hurt your foot? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. You're an adult, yet you still wear a foot-bell? - I've worn it since birth. - Since birth? Yes. - My parents put it on me. - Are they living? If they were alive, would she be seeking revenge? Besides vengeance, I'm searching. - For what? - Someone with the same bell. If it's a girl, then we'll be sisters. - If it's a man? - We'll marry. - You're spoken for? - My parents arranged it. Zhi Ming! Zhi Ming! Zhi Ming, come over. What are you doing? Come here. Monks are like that. Just leave him be. What are you doing? What is it? - Nothing. - Nothing! - This is very thoughtful. - Not at all, not at all. - I'm not cold. - She's not cold, so take it back. It'll be dawn soon, we must sleep. - Why are you hanging around? - Me? What about you? Teacher! Hold it! - Who are you? - This my teacher and my brothers. - Teacher? - Yes. I'm Yi Ren, from North Shaolin. Buddha be praised. - Why are you here? - For Zhi Ming. He sneaked out of the temple. The abbot's furious. I have to bring him back. - The reason I... - Enough! I already know. Zhi Ming, you must try to forget revenge. He Suo owes a blood debt. We can't forget! So, you're with him. Yes, we intend to kill He to avenge our parents. - Where are you from? - South Shaolin Temple. - I'm Si Ma Yan. - Why don't you go home? Our attempt to kill He Suo failed. His men are looking for us. - I'd like to escort them back. - You can't! - You will return with me. - But sir... You can reach Putian safely by water. Let's go! - Take care. - Take care. Let's go. We can't stay here, come on. Grand Abbots. Buddha bless you. Lord Buddha, your servant Yi Ren failed in his sworn duty to discipline his wayward student. He must accept the responsibility and the punishment. I accept any punishment. You have served our temple well for many years, you will take twelve pole monks and escort Master Wu Lou to South Shaolin. - You will carry no provisions. - Yes, Abbot. Lord Abbot, I should be punished, not teacher. - You still wish for vengeance. - I'm a Shaolin monk. Isn't the spirit of Shaolin to thirst for justice? Don't make excuses in front of the Buddha! When you were brought to this temple as an orphan, we decided to take you in. Even after so long you still have not left the outside world behind. You are still consumed with hatred. You left the temple without consent. You should be expelled. But you are young and have no family in the outside world. - You will serve three years of penance. - But Abbot... - Buddha bless you. - Let's go. - Here you are. - This is no big deal. Get out! Three years, so what? They think I'll look at a lousy wall for three years? Don't damage my drawings. - Did you paint all these? - Sure I did. Who else could have? - They're all wrong. - What's the matter with them? What are you doing? You hit me! - I'm shaking up the abbot. - How dare you! - That's my kung fu. - Kung fu? - Wha... Turtles? - Right! They teach kung fu here, but hide in their shells like turtles. Why are you striking the merciful Buddha with lightning? Buddha is blind to justice, so now he's really blind! He takes people across the sea of suffering. You have to agree. What... They've all drowned. Buddha doesn't believe in averting tragedy. - Will I survive this place? - Surely. You have great strength. Just walk out. No. I can't. I was raised here, the temple is my home. How can I leave it? Crazy little monk! You were full of anger so you ruined my drawings. I sympathized. I thought you needed some wise advice. There is one thing troubling me. I don't care now. I don't want to hear it. This means I'm pledged in marriage. You know a monk can never marry. You must forget her. - Forget her? - Buddha bless you. You mustn't ruin two lives. - Master, what should I do? - Okay, okay. It seems I must sneak you out of the temple. - Secretly? - Sort it out, then return quickly. - Thank you, master! - Hey, hey. Up there. I can get out there? Do you think I'd stay here for nine years without a break? Thank you. Get away! Where's the captain? Lord He Suo is angry! You'll be lucky not to lose your heads. - Let's go. - Hold it! Shaolin fighters are tricky opponents. - What shall we do? - Let's report. - Well? - We found them. My lord, we found them! They're at Shaolin Temple. You idiots! Why didn't you bring them back here immediately? Forgive me, Lord, but we were only two, and they are expert fighters. Are they really? Better than me? So the tyrant tried to trap you on the road south. He would have destroyed you. Zhao Wei, you have served me well. You have preserved the family line. I am deeply appreciative. I am only a secular student, but I know my duty and do it willingly. Besides, Si Ma Yan was bravery itself. I'm not worthy of your compliments. - On the contrary, it's true. - You think too highly of me. - I mean every word. - That's enough. Zhao Wei, you'd better change your clothes. - Go on now. - Yes. - My dear, a storm is coming to Shaolin. - He Suo will come here for us? Yes. If we stay here we'll bring disaster to the temple, so we must leave now. Praise to Buddha. Excuse me, where are you from? What's that you say? - It's an old man. - Where have you come from? - North Shaolin Temple. - Ah, our brothers in the north. It must be the visitor. Tell the abbot. Zhao Wei. Zhao Wei! - Where's Si Ma Yan? - Who are you? Oh, it's you again, Zhi Ming. Are you here to collect a reward for your help? And is that reward to be Yan? Yan's foot-bell! - It's mine. - Liar! We're brothers, we mustn't fight. This man is also Shaolin. Hand over the foot-bell or you won't leave this temple! Take it then. Tell her that this is the matching foot-bell she has sought for so long. Is it really yours? You're the man she's looking for. No! I'll take you to her. - You go alone. - Come on! Si Ma Yan. Si Ma Yan! Yan and her uncle have fled the temple. Come on! They got here fast. It must be Zhi Ming! Yi Ren... The blame lies with our novices. - You were careless. - How did he get in? Shame on you! - Are you so stupid? - Speak up. It's entirely your fault. Go and bring Zhi Ming out here! - Find the miscreant. - Yes! - What now? - Run! Zhi Ming, come down here! - Teacher... - Come on. - Come back! - Yi Ren! - Find out what those two are up to. - Master Wu Lou... Something's gone wrong. We must find them! - Master Fai Ren. - Master Fai Ren! Master, where's Si Ma Yan? She was taken by boat. Quick, the river! - What's that boat? - It looks official. - Talk! - You'll have to kill me first! They've got her on the boat! - What now? - We give chase. The boat is already out of range. - We have to rescue her. - But not by rushing to our deaths. - What shall we do? - We use our heads. Come with me. Si Ma Yan, do you want to die? It would be easy to arrange. - So kill me, I'm not scared. - There's no rush. It will wait. I'll get those other bastards and send you all to hell. You people have never posed a real threat to me. If you think you can kill two Shaolin fighters, you're crazy! Look! We've overtaken the boat now. - I've an idea. - What? The river's really narrow. We could easily block it. Let's use those rafts. There's something up ahead! Stop the boat! Move those rafts immediately! Let us through. Push them aside! Stop the boat! What's going on? My lord, the boat is stuck. Is it indeed? These bastards are cunning. Get rid of the rafts. Take her inside and watch her. There he is! Get him! Get that one! Kill him! An impressive southern style. He's mine! Look out! - Zhi Ming! - Si Ma Yan! - My lord, these monks are a nuisance. - Tell our men to surround the boat. I'll send them to join their ancestors. - Zhi Ming, you'll be killed! - I'll get you free! You want your revenge? Then come and get it! I see that your northern style is not bad either. - Get Yan out! - No one leaves! Want to run? No one's ever escaped my sword. Teacher! Come! Attack! Kill them all! We can't hold out! I'll send you to heaven! My lord, they're everywhere! - Abbot? - Our laws say uphold justice! That's it. Use the pole! My lord, you must flee! Don't let him get away! He Suo, why are you running? It's time to settle all debts. Very well. Good kung fu, but your situation is desperate. For the first time, you cannot win. I advise you to lay aside your sword now. - He Suo, surrender. - Never! Buddha have mercy on you. - Zhi Ming, wait! - Take care, my friend. - Keep this and look after her. - Zhi Ming... He's gone? That band. The other bell was with you? Yes... My friends, take care!
