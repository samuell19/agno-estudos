You're a smooth criminal, baby! You sang just as well as your mother, honestly. Ugh, I can only stay for a little bit. Come on, don't be a party pooper. It's not my fault I have to get back by 12. Jesus, Cinderella! Relax! Come on! -Vodka? -Shh! -What are you doing? -What is this? Go now! You'll see. What are you doing? Come with me! Ana, this is... Rares! Rares, this is my friend Virginia. Hi, nice to meet you. Enjoy is the code. High school years. #pedophilia saves Romania Where are you? I'm with Martha, on the sea. You promised that tonight we were gonna dance together. Yasmine... I didn't promise you anything. At least you could have been here with me. Seriously, did you really have to go to the seaside now? You know what? I'm a virgin too! I was thinking it would be cool not to be one by the time I finished high school. Don't be afraid, Ana. Yasmine... I'm leaving. It's the prom, our last party all together. Don't you think we deserve a proper party instead of this crap? -With whom? -Just the three of us! Come! Enjoy! Immortals Super heroes from mere dreamers Immortals We can do whatever we want Now we are adults Immortals Super heroes from mere dreamers Immortals We can do whatever we want Now we are adults I can't believe you did this. If Dad sees me like this, he'll kill me. Did you see the look on the biology teacher's face? -Priceless! -They didn't understand a thing anyway. Good thing we're rid of them. Yeah? Where do you wanna go? -Surprise! -Surprise! It's 12. Can you drop me home? -You'll be sorry. -We shouldn't have left anyway. What did you want us to do? Sit and stare at the teachers groping each other under the tables? If only Sergiu were among them... Mmm, the history teacher... God, how I'd grope the history teacher under the table. Yeah, too bad he's gay. -He isn't. -Sure he's gay. He's 30 and nobody has ever seen him with a woman. Smells gay to me... -And he wears clothes that match. -God, and he smells good. -I'm telling you, he isn't. -Fine. Ana, why are you going home? Didn't you say it was prom night and we would make it count? My dad heard that some people in Focsani City got food poisoning from eating at the prom... and he packed me a snack. No shit, you have sandwiches on you? Hey, my mother packed me condoms! So, woohoo! Where are you going? My business! -Yasmine, where are you taking us? -Fratelli... -Which one? -Mamaia resort. -No... -Awesome! No, take me home this instant. Now! From this moment on, no computer, TV, nor phone for you. -But, Daddy... -Hand it over! Shame on you. You stink of alcohol and cigarettes, you come home at this hour and try to sneak in like a rat. -I didn't want to wake you. -You're irresponsible. I even let you go. You have your finals on Monday! I'm sorry. My father would have beaten me to a pulp had I done anything like this. And I totally forbid you to see that impertinent Roxana and that slutty Yasmine again, understood? Go to bed! I love you. I miss you. I changed my mind. I'm coming with you! Morning. -Jesus, what are you doing here? -Morning. It's a full moon. What are you doing here? Come on, it's romantic. Are you upset? Sergiu! Are you upset? -No, I'm not upset, it's just... -Just what? We are not alone on the boat. You know you shouldn't be here? You shouldn't be here either. If I remember right, you should be at a prom, dancing with a girl you promised the best night of her life. This expedition came at the last minute. I've already dived and found some... -I don't give a fuck about your diving. -Lower your voice. You promised we wouldn't hide anymore. The prom was the way to tell everyone that we're an item. Take the finals, get into college, you have more important things to think about right now. -Is this how you usually treat girls? -Meaning? You raise them... I'm sorry, you graze on them. And then you send them on their way. You're vulgar. And you don't like it anymore? Professor, sir, you don't like it anymore? -I'm leaving. -Yasmine, wait. Yasmine, wait. You'll see what it's like to be promised something, and get nothing! YOUR MOTHER -Maybe she went to the car. -She'd never just sit in the car. Yasmine! What the hell, woman, where have you been? -Nowhere. -We've looked everywhere for you! Let's go take a swim, come on! You're leaving all the time, dude, all the bloody time. -I was here, woman! -Where? Well done, Ana! We'll take a swim, and then we go home. Girls, let's get some money out, grab a coffee, eat and head back. OK, Virgy? Selfie! Let's just get something on the road. We'll save time. Fun Police, seriously, I really need a cup of coffee... or 20, after all that booze last night. Come on. It's crawling with cops during the day. You want them to revoke my driving licence? -Do you know what today is? -It's Saturday?! It's J. Balvin at The Mission! "Tranquila"... It's also two days before the finals. Exactly! We've still got one... -No, we already decided! -Virgy... Besides, my dad will definitely come after me. Virgy, it's high time you became a woman. Yeap, an independent one! -Is it? -Well, yes! So what if he gets angry, I'm 18! We're witnessing a miracle. Let him come after me, I don't care. What can he do to me? Ana! Goddammit! Man... These seem rich. You're finally putting your brain to good use. What's with these girls at 7 o'clock in the morning? I don't know, bro, but they seem gullible. This should do it. Dude, this won't do shit, we wait... With so many clubs opened, some drunk rich kids are bound to pass by. You think a drunk rich kid is gonna come at 7:00 a.m. to withdraw money? Only poor kids take out enough for a shawarma, we'll end up with 600 lei again. -600 per ATM is a joke... -Six hundred in one hour? That's two hundred apiece. It's better than any job. We're not working, dude, we're stealing. There are other risks, we have to make more money. Dude, it's not right... Check out this girl, she looks like some MP's kid. I bet her card is 100% full. Man, are you dumb or what? There are super hotties in the next car and they've been checking us out since we parked. Top-notch hotties, man, check this out! -Let's sting her! -Come on, dude. And besides, we can't, we're all three in the car. D'oh! We work them smoothly. We tell them some bullshit story, we take them for a ride and when we reach an ATM, we do our thing and get their card. You're a genius, man, I say she'll deliver it straight to us... Check this out. -She's all wet. -What's her PIN code? 0000? No shit? What PIN code is that? PINguin code. Come on, bro, they're underage. So what, it's not like they'll give us underage money. Look at her! -Move over! -Yasmine! There are cute guys in the next car and... one waved at me. Which one? The one behind the wheel. With the muscles. -That "big city life" wannabe redneck? -Dude, cut it off... Wave back goodbye and let's go. The voice of reason. What the hell... -Fuck! -Fuck! -You did that on purpose! -I can't get out of the car! I didn't do it on purpose, what's wrong with you?! Hang on a sec. He's coming over. Fuck! -Fuck! -What is he doing? Excuse me, girls, but you kind of humped our car. So, now you want some too? I know that usually in these cases you apologize or at least behave... Fine! What are you doing, you don't know how to react so you call a friend? No, baby, I'm calling the police. Maybe your daddy gave you this car before you got your license. If you cause an accident, you call the cops, clear? Good morning, I would like to report an accident. Is he calling the police? Yasmine, I don't want to end up at the police! Girl, give me a break, I just crumpled him up a bit, you think anyone's gonna show up for a thump like this? -Of course! -Yeah, right! -What? -Are you crazy! He's calling me... -He's playing them! -Get back in the car! Did you go to driving school? Who cares about these shitty rules? Come on! Yes. It's pretty serious. Yes... No... it's... Yes. Straight into me. Baby... can I kiss it and make it better? More to the left... -Is here good? -Yeah, but I've already called the cops. Instead of involving the police, wouldn't you rather... go to a bar? Relax a little, grab some coffee? I don't know if I can relax with such a crumpled hood. Come on, I'll teach you. I promise. I learnt it in school. Come on! Problem solved! -We'll buy them breakfast and that's it. -We're going to get an omelet. I'm eating with these guys. I'm not going, man. What if they are murderers? Come on, virgin boy, come. Dude, what the hell, I said I'm not going. Better rapists, so we can get your problem solved! -Hello. -Hello, good morning, Mrs Popa. Ceausu speaking, sorry to disturb, how are you? -Fine, thank you. Yourself? -Good! Not important. Mrs. Popa, do you have any idea if Ana is with Roxana? Just a moment. Roxi! Roxi's not here either, I guess they're having a sleepover at Yasmine's. You're guessing, you don't know for sure? Well, do you know where Ana is? Unfit mother. -Hello? -Good morning, Mr Necsulescu? -Yes. -I'm sorry to disturb... Nicu Ceausu here. Do you have any idea if Ana is with Yasmine? No. Fuckin' idiot. Hello. Emergency Services. Good morning, sorry to disturb you, Ceausu speaking, I want to report the disappearance of a girl... -I mean the kidnapping of a girl. -When was that? The age? Be patient, please, you have no children, I can tell. Last night, yesterday evening... Yes. -Her age? -18. Hello? This is not the end of it! -So how long are you around for? -We eat and we go. We don't know for sure, we'd like to go to The Mission party tonight. -Let's go, we're joining you. -Ah, cool. -Here you go. -Finally! I know you from somewhere. -Don't you eat anything in the morning? -Nor for lunch, nor in the evening. -Chubby here only eats between meals. -Cut it out! Want some? Thanks. So what college did you say you're from? We're not. We have the first of our finals on Monday. -Good luck! -You're in high school? -Thanks. Yeah, we were... -And you guys? Are you in college? I go to the Polytechnic School. He goes to the Romanian-American University and... -Magi is just living his life. -Cool! What major, at Poly? Aerospatial engineering. Isn't it kind of useless? I've never heard of any missiles being launched from Romania. Well, they launch them sometimes. Thank you! -I want to study Journalism. -Nice. And you, which school do you go to? Wow! What the... That's awesome! That's what I do. Some of us have to work, you know? Not wasting time with school. -We all work, sort of... -What kind of work? Bank. In a bank. Pencil pushers. -And you? -I'm going to Princeton, Special Maths. Yup, I'm gonna miss you. -And you? -You want to hire us, or what? -Shall I leave you a resumé? -Chill, baby, don't be so jumpy. It's OK if you don't know yet. You have your whole life to think about it. Baby, I'm going to acting school. I've heard the bars are cool there, and you can hang out in tank tops and tights. I've always liked women in tights. Attention... To the side! Left arm up... right hand up... Arm perfectly stretched! -Come in! -Eight, seven... Four more to go. -Please have a seat! -Thank you! -Forgive me, but I can't stop. -Four more to go. We grab the ball! Up! Mrs... Popa, I'm sorry to bother you, I called everywhere and nobody knows anything. Mr Nicu, calm down, Roxi left a message. They only went on a little trip to the seaside, that's all. To the seaside? -What for? -To have a little swim in the sea... Before all this craziness with the finals. What else? Would you please call Roxi and ask her where they are? What for? They're coming back tonight, don't you get it? Mrs. Popa, I'm going after my girl. If you'd rather sit here and... fool around like this, go ahead. -What the fuck are you doing? -The history teacher is here! Get out of there! -Good afternoon! -Hey, girls, what are you doing here? We came for a little swim. Isn't this... risky, two days before the finals? We're just having a little fun, like teenagers. We're going to a concert tonight, at The Mission. What about you, what are you doing? I'm doing some diving with the people over there. We already found some Dacian coins, but don't tell anybody, OK? -OK, girls, have fun! -Thank you! -Thank you! -Good bye! -"Dacian coins"?! -"Thank you"! -Is it really wise to go? -Your dad is a bundle of nerves anyway. It's doesn't matter whether we arrive today or tomorrow morning. -Yeah, girl. -Come on. The smartest thing you could do right now is to enjoy it to the max! -Yeah! -Come on! -The Mission! -Come on! Before your dad throws you in a convent and you'll be named Mother Sofronia. Woman, you're leaving in a month, how bad can it be? -Come on. -Come, Virgy! OK... Momma Leana. So good and hot. What is this? What's this? -Collector's car! -I'm not getting in this piece of crap. Why don't you stay home, I don't feel like cruising the seashore with you in Ceausescu's bus. Are you coming or not? From Sergiu Luv: I am alone on Ma t a. Waiting for you. -Fucking goddamn stupid car! -Sorry... What the... -Come on, bro, let's go. -Take it easy, there's no fire. Jesus, that girlie made him go crazy! Money! Remember to bring a lollipop, or a fruity yogurt to give her afterwards. -A piece of candy to suck on. -I wouldn't mind giving her a lollipop. -You're such a cocksucker! -Not me, man! Her! Oops! We're not stealing their credit card anymore? How come? Because we're going out with them, we're friends now. Dude, I'm not friends with anybody. Come on, Mihai, it's not OK, they're just kids! Besides, they're cute, in their own way... OK. Especially the one who ran away from home. -The one with handles, you mean? -With the what? Handles! So you don't get lost in her. She's gonna suck you in! -At least mine is not a floozy. -Did you hear that? -His, he says! -Did you buy her? Bro, don't get me wrong... but that's one big ass, man! A woman without curves is like jeans without pockets, you don't know where to put your hands. Yeah, I take it that I'm left again with the beautiful and smart one. And a virgin to boot! None of your business. I'm the explorer type. You do have something to explore there. -Manual labor, come on! -You're such a redneck. Anyway, their card is as good as mine. Guys, we won't rob them anymore. Oh, boy, maybe I'll have a car crash! I can't remember the name of this song, so annoying. Nevermind. -Is this really Ceausescu's bus? -Sure thing. Scout's honor. -And when did you get it? -Immediately. -Immediately, when? -Immediately after... What's the word? I forgot... the Revolution. Those were the days, during Ceausescu's time. Tears get into my eyes when I remember. Things were working, you have no idea. You're not actually saying that we were better off in Ceausescu's time? Nobody grumbled back then! You could find... anything! From time to time. People didn't make any abuse. School was school! Careful. Kids didn't go out without their parents' permission. Parents didn't go out because it was pointless. Fantastic times. This baby really rolls! Did you check if your daughter posted anything on Facebook? I don't spy on my little girl on Facebook. Ouch, really? Interesting. I do! Listen? My dear wife, Gina, died when Ana was little and I had to raise her by myself and... you saw what a great girl I brought up, huh? -I also raised my girl by myself. -I can see that. Thank you. When I was 19, I was daft enough to believe a guy when he told me he loved me even though we'd known each other only for three days. That is how Roxi appeared, and he disappeared. Hello, yoo-hoo! What are we doing in here? I can see you! I have a mirror, you know. We don't smoke in here, thank you very much. If you want, we stop and we smoke. I will get the smoking out of you by the time we arrive. Why would you put that crap in your body... Come on, girl... Come on... It's with onion and garlic as you like it. -One bite! -Leave me be, seriously. Roxi, you have to eat. No, I don't. I've been on this diet for more than a month and it works perfectly. -Really? And what diet is this? -Prehistoric. Prehistoric? -Meaning? -You eat every few days... Just like these guys in prehistoric times hunted every few days... you know... -Sorry... -Today it's called "bulimia." Ana, leave her be. You think I haven't seen her secretly stuffing herself? What do you have in there? Do you have provisions? Let me see! If we're talking about doing stuff secretly, why don't you tell us the reason why we went to the seaside today? Huh? -You're hiding stuff from me again? -I'm not! So, tell me. -It's none of your business! -Oh, I think it is. We came to the seaside so Yasmine could fuck the history teacher a bit. Not to celebrate our friendship or whatever. I fuck whom I want, when I want, clear? So you are banging him? We broke up. You were in a relationship and you didn't tell us? Right... with the history teacher! You know what? It's not my fault men prefer me... -...over a whale like you. -With the history teacher? What are you doing, girl? -What are you doing... -Since when? Since when do you hit me? We came to the seaside two days before the finals so you could do stuff with the teacher? I didn't do anything!! I completely defied my dad to be with my best friends who are lying to me the whole time! -What did I do? -You never told me, Roxi! -I just found out myself, really! -You know what? It's not our fault that your dad is crazy, OK? He's not crazy and he was right when he said I should never see the two of you again! -Excuse me? What's got into you? -You're assholes! No, Ana, you are the asshole! Both of you are! Everything is always about you. You are so selfish. And yes, know that I don't say anything because you always judge me. And I'll never say anything to you anymore. Fine! I really don't need to know the adventures from "The diary of a stupid whore"! -Go hunt a shawarma! -Stop acting like hillbillies! Fuck you, Ana! I don't want to be with you for even a second longer! You fucking redneck! You're an idiot! -And if I put my head out of the window? -Then the smoke gets in anyway! You're not putting no head out of the window, you're driving me crazy! -Fine, then stop for five minutes, please! -I won't stop for five minutes, OK? -You hit something! -What did I hit? How should I know? Go see what you hit! There was nothing I could've hit. You did hit something! Move over, I'll see for myself, if you can't do it! I told you we don't stand a chance with this piece of crap! -Look and see what you've done. -I've had enough! That's enough! I can't take it anymore! Stop it! You drove me crazy! All the way only crap and nonsense! For half an hour you've been nagging me to stop so you could smoke! There you go, I stopped! Smoke now! Smoke! There you go! Smoke! Incredible, crazy women everywhere! Goddammit, we have a flat tire! You don't care, right? You're smoking... I have a flat tire and you... Come and see what you've done! Enough with that rustling in the back already! -I don't want to! -Fuck you! -What are you doing? -Nothing! Are those the sandwiches from my dad? They sat in the car all day, and the car was in the sun! Why do you care? You don't want anything to do with me anymore. From Sergiu Luv: Forgive me. I want to see you. Would you, from time to time, look at the road? Would you, from time to time, remove that stick from your ass? Fucking "saint." -Give me the backpack! -No. Roxi, let me throw away those sandwiches! I'm not enough of an idiot to eat rotten food, OK? If she wants to be as big as a whale, so be it! Leave her alone! Stop it! How would you like to walk back to Bucharest? -Hello, what are you doing? -I'm trying to call my dad. -Don't you have the number? -No, I don't. What would I need his number for? Do you want Daddy to come and bring your toys? Grow up, baby! Yeah, good thing you're an adult! -Girls? -What? Give me five! Come on. Come on, give me five. You... put your palm here... Come on! Let's enjoy childhood a little while longer! My folks don't have a clue. We're here, you princesses! What are you doing, Roxi? Sleeping on duty? Up, energy, come on! I'm not in the mood, I think I'm having my period. Not tonight! Come on. -"Tranquila," baby! -I want to go home too. We should go back, seriously. I think my poor dad already had a heart attack. You two are pissing me off. If we said we're going, then we're going! Enough! Come on! What? What's with you? Jesus! -This means you're not coming? -I look like a toad! What do you think? No... You don't look like a toa... I mean you can barely notice it. We're a family, remember? Come on... Let's have some fun! It's our last night together! I don't even like that James Jay guy. It's better to go home, we have the finals coming up. Come on, princess, move your ass, now Ana doesn't want to come either. -I said I'm not going! -OK, Roxi! Stay here with your imaginary Facebook friends! Come along, Ana! -We can't just leave her here! -I don't need you, anyway! We shouldn't have left. I wanted us to be together, not to go to some concert... What the hell is wrong with me? Fuck this shit! Fuck Mr Ceausu's sandwiches! Fuck! Hang on... Hop, hop... You're a godsend! Hop, hop... You are such a jerk! Man, what a jerk, like you couldn't stop, you fucking jerk. Come on... Stop, stop now... stop! You fucking jerk! Jerks! You're such a jerk, you jerk! In Ceausescu's time, people would stop, would help you, would love you... Would report you, you jerk... Don't you have brakes, you fucking pig? You do have brakes, you just don't give a shit! I will sit here and if you don't like it, run me over. If you come up with the wrench, you'll go to jail, let me see you, I'm waiting. Come on with the 30 mm wrench. I'm waiting, where the hell are you? No worries, we wait, we don't have anything else to do anyhow... Look how comfy this asphalt is, I'm just gonna lie down here. Oh, boy, that feels good. Yeah, like that... run me over now. There he is, there comes one... You don't want to run me over now, do you? Hey, jerk, can't you see me, what the hell! Sir! Thank you very much for stopping. Do you, by chance, have a 30 mm wrench in there? Get out of the way, man, are you crazy? Just look, maybe you forgot you have it. I'm looking for a 30 mm wrench. -Get out of the way, you're insane! -A 30 mm wrench, please. If I don't get out of the way, what are you going to do? Run me over? I'm in a hurry, get out of the way, you're crazy! I am in a hurry too, that's why I'm asking you for a 30 mm wrench. -Wait, what are you doing? -Move, man! Go someplace else. -Fuck you! -I can't believe it... what a jerk. Excuse me, do you have a 30 mm wrench? Are you ready?! But where is Roxi? She's having her period, and the hunger made her go nuts! OK. Let's go! Come on! Where is Yasmine? She left with a gentleman. She's unbelievable! I didn't even want to come to this concert! Neither did I. Let's go. Watch out for Brain! SEAWATER HEALS THE SKIN... I need this to put up with you for longer. They had 30 mm wrenches before. Trunks full of it, but now... I haven't smoked since poor Gina died, my wife. I had to raise Ana. Well, she's grown up now, I believe that you can have a smoke. Same sinister crap, only much, much, much crappier... -Well, thanks. I made it myself. -I can tell. Wow, it even got me dizzy. Listen, that Roxi of yours, does she smoke? She can't even stand the smoke, she says that it makes her sick and puke. That's a good one, she can't stand the smoke. Have you looked carefully in her room, have you dug up her stuff? Have you searched the little backpack well, to see if she's not lying to you? God forbid! How can I search the girl's purse? Purse, Roxi has a purse, not a backpack. -And what did I say? -Little backpack. So what? Ana has a little backpack, do you have a problem with that? -No. -Good! Just to be clear! I bet that stinking jerk Yasmine, puffs them like a chimney, right? Why are you talking like that? She's not a bad kid either, you know. Not a bad kid, another good one... Oh, my, she's not a bad kid. When the cat's away... Give me some more. I don't know what's in it, but I like it. When the cat's away, the mice will play. I'm sure she had many shady relationships with all kinds of leches. -No, she had relationships... -Enough! It's normal, she's 18. You think mine didn't ride the flagpole? What did you say? This isn't Ceausescu's time, girls don't stay a virgin until they marry. They should mind their own business. Learn, study, settle down. And only after that should they start worrying about this. Give me a break! Before, the girls cooked like their mothers and now they get drunk like their fathers. This has nothing to do with me. I do not drink. I never touched liquor. -Not at all? -Not even a bit. But the girls, when they meet, they're always on the bottle. Relax! They are good girls! And smart! If they were good and smart, they would have a book in front of them now. Not the seashells... Wow, strong waves! Come back with me to the concert! -Yasmine, please. -Come on! There will be Ana, Roxi and a lot of strangers. Come on, please. Who cares that a history teacher is seeing a student? An ex student in fact! Come on, please. I understand you're stressed out, and you're not quite yourself, but... Let's try to enjoy this moment as it is. You're going home tonight. -Oh, please! -You have one last obstacle to pass. After that, Yasmine, listen to me, we'll do exactly what you want. -Please, stop telling me what to do! -But someone has to! -But not you! -Yes, me, because I care about you! Are you coming? No. Yasmine, please don't... you're leaving again! Yasmine! What's up? The concert started. Where are you? Jesus! Chill, why are you so desperate? OK. The truth is that I'm by your car and I saw you and I froze... and... I don't have any clothes. Put something on. Bye! I lost them. So I can't. Bye! -No, go away immediately! -Relax! What... What the f...! Take them! Take them! I swear I won't peek! No, really, I can't take them. It's weird! Then don't take them. We'll both just stay like this. I won't put them back on anyway. The breeze is really nice, you know. Thanks. Tell me when you're ready. Come on... Come on... Fuck! Come on! Oh, come on... what are you doing? Are you crying? Rox... Let me be, I want to be alone! Come on, don't be silly! What are you crying for? You're at the seaside, it's nice, so what if you have three boils. Big deal. A little lower... And if you are such a super magician, why don't you make them disappear? Maybe I'm the one who made them show up in the first place. To isolate you here. Yeah, sure, you settle for what you can find. If it were somebody else... But you're stuck with a fat toad now. Don't be silly! I like... you. And you are not fat! It's me who's too skinny. You are a bit... skinny. Here... blow! How can you blow, it's ash, do you want to make a mess? But you told me to! God! Who knows for how long I've had this thing on! -I can't believe it! -Rox... -How did you do it? -Maybe I was born this way. OK... Close your eyes, OK? Imagine that you are with a super cool actor. One who looks super hot. With Plorin Fiersic. OK, no. With a super cool, super hot actor who can tear your pants off with just one hand. -Where will we sleep? -Look how big the moon is. We have two options: one is outdoors under the sky, or, if you prefer, here in the bus, together... It's not gonna work. Outdoors, on the ground, like that, no. Except I thought of everything. No, I can't believe it. -Pa da bam! -I don't believe... A little mattress for Ceci... And a little blanky-blanky for little Cecisor... Wait a minute, I have not finished. You sing? Yes. One of the few things my mother left me. She wanted so much for me to study at the Conservatory. I would love to, one day. This way, I would fulfill my dream and hers at the same time. -And why don't you? -My father won't let me. Classic! But have you tried talking to him... explaining? He doesn't get it. He's more pragmatic. And he is the most serious man I know. I would love to hear you sing. -Would you? -OK... Ah, I'm getting a cramp. I'd better carry you! Hold on, I'm getting dizzy! You're such an idiot! -Come on, baby! Ride me a little. -Dude... Watch out, don't break anything. Let me, I'll drive! Come on! -You're not touching it! -Excuse me? You're not touching it! You haven't even driven it and you crashed it two times. -Are you crazy? -Hold this a second. So, you are getting cocky and I can't understand why. Seriously now. It's not mine. I'm not kidding! The sooner you understand that I do what I want, when I want, the better off you will be. Got it? Come on! Let's see... what this wreck of yours can do. Come! Girl, you're such a screw-ball! Push the goddamn button! I'll go to the other side! Wait, let me buckle up first! -What are you doing? -I'm putting the seat belt on. Put yours on too! Hit the brakes! I did! Press the clutch! Do you know how to drive or not? -Shut your trap, you're confusing me! -Press the clutch! Press! Shut up, I said, you're confusing me! Well done! Watch out! Slow down... Let's see what happens... I can't believe it! I took it out without hitting it! And I told them that my car is broken and they didn't believe me! -Let me show you the stuff I can do! -No! Look, how awesome! -Don't you want to stay another night? -No, we really have to leave. I think my poor dad is worried sick, and there's also the finals to think about. Let me show you something. Trust me! Come with me! -Sorry, are you OK? -Yeah. Can you tear the t-shirt too? See? I'm good at it. Hold on... Dear Lord, I'm scared! Chill, bro, I'm slowing down, what's up with you? -Pièce de résistance... -You said you didn't drink! I said that, but I was referring to something else. I dont know what I was thinking about. Please... Thanks. It's just wine. I'll pour you only a sip to see how it is, try it, please. -Wait, don't drink it yet. -I'm not. Let us think of a wish to come true. Thank you for thinking of the same thing! Got bless! For lucky times! Oh, God, you do exist! If you make a wish, and the sea lights up the second the stone hits the water, your wish comes true. -For real? -Try it! -You make one, too. -Already have. Come on! I can't believe it. What are you doing? You're insane! Dude, the brakes aren't working! Hey! Dude! Fuck! Oh, my God. Hold this. -Help! -Help! -Help! -We're locked in here. -Come quickly! Open up! -Dude! -Bogdan! -Bogdan! Bogdan! -You can do it, Bogdan! -Mihai! -Come on, pull, Bogdan! -Come on! -Bogdan! -Come on, do something, Mihai! -I can't! -It won't open! -It won't open. -I can't! -Bogdan! Where did he go? -Bogdan! -Ana! -Ana! -Come on! Do something! -Ana! Come on! Do something, Mihai! Move away! Come on, Bogdan! Mihai! Come on, Bogdan! Get me out! Are you alright? What have you done, dude? You ruined George's car! He'll kill you! Mihai, you're drunk! Shut the fuck up! The water's fine. -Fucking asshole! -I'm swimming... You goddamn jerk! Come along! Leave! Go away! -Nicu! Wake up! -Why? -Tell him to go away, please! -To whom? This dog next to us. Take a look at that! Let me see him too. -This puppy was the problem. -Tell him to go away. We are sitting butt naked on the side of the road and you're worried about this puppy. Leave me alone! Look what a mess you've made of me! He's sitting on my dress. Tell him to go, man! He'll go! Come on, go away! Look, he's gone! So, last night we had a flat tire, we drank some wine, smoked weed and then I can't remember anything. We smoked weed? You drugged me? I didn't drug you, you did it all by yourself. Try to remember what happened afterwards. How could I remember if you drugged me? Got it! I know! We played strip poker, here are the playing cards. Take it easy, take it easy. Don't pet him, man, maybe he has fleas! So what? You got me high, I give you fleas! You really are a jerk! -Can you give me my dress, please? -Get it yourself! If you give me my dress, I'll help you with the flat tire. -No way! -Wanna bet I can stop a car? I would like to see you try! 30 mm wrench? What are you doing, guys? Romantic hang out at sunrise? Dude, tell him! Mihai, tell him! You tell him! Aren't you the one who broke the window? -Seriously? -Yeah, dude, seriously! I saved your life, you asshole! I should have let you die! The car sank because of you! You idiot! What's with you? This drunk plunged your car into the sea. And what's the catch? There's no catch, dude. It's for real! Well, where is it? I can't see it. Man, this is the most bizarre panic attack I've ever seen. Guys, chill, the car wasn't mine. It was stolen. What do you mean, stolen? From whom? What does it matter from where, are you crazy? The man isn't upset! Dude, do you know what was in the car? -The money! -Our IDs! -Our gear! -Man, are you dumb or what? It doesn't matter, bro! We'll make more money. You, man? You'll make more money? And now what about the cops? -Nothing. We won't report it. -Well, what if they find it? How can they find it, Brain? Do they conduct raids on the bottom of the sea? With some miniature submarines? Dude, where are your clothes? I managed to get stark naked in one single night! Just like when I was 20. With no worries and no money. You could have banged a prettier girl, though. -Fuck you, you fucking idiot! -George! Good afternoon, madam! Baby, do you happen to have a 30 mm wrench? That's great! Just get back here! We could leave the car here and take the train. I don't know, but we are fucked if we don't get back today. God, if only she woke up today! Stop it, dude! You'll get into a fight now? -Shut up! Go on and talk to the girls! -Go on! -Stop pushing me, OK? -Come on! -Hey! -Hey! -You're leaving? -We're waiting for Yasmine to wake up. Can you give us a ride? We have nothing left. Yeah, sure. Dude, the cops are behind you! -Calm down, chill. -Yasmine, the cops are here! So what? Take it easy. Sorry! Easy... I'm fucked! We'll end up in jail. Goodbye, finals. My dad is going to kill me and I will be selling "Momma Leana's Beer" for the rest of my life. -I can't believe this! -Dude, calm them down! Guys, stop it already, everything will be OK. Ana, we'll get to Bucharest in two hours. You'll take the finals with flying colors and you'll have the happiest life ever. Before that, I say we should put in some gas. I can't believe it! The money is in the car! -Yasmine has money. -Yeah, sure! We're friends only when I have to give you money. Are you aware that you sunk a car and the police are looking for us because of this? Keep calm! I think I have some money. I can't find it! Keep looking, Yasmine! I'm looking and I can't find it! It's nowhere! -Produce the card! -I don't have it! -Why should he give it? -Give me the card! -I told you I don't have it! -I'm confused! Mihai, give the card back this instant! We are in this mess together. It doesn't make sense! Dude, why the fuck did you have my card? And how did you know that the card was on him? What did I tell you, Mihai? Didn't we agree not to take anything from them? Yasmine sank our car and we lost everything. I had every right to take that card! -You're not a magician, you're a thief? -Sure I'm a magician! That's why we met at an ATM? You were out to clone my card? Bodgan?! -We didn't want to clone anything! -Oh, my bad. You wanted to steal it! -"Stealing" is a relative term anyway. -Enough! Get out of the car! Move it! Get out of the car! Come on! You fucking punks! Out! Come on, get the fuck out of here, move it! -Mihai, you're an idiot! -Get lost! -Jerk! -Fucking shit! -Roxi, will I see you again? -We'll talk on Facebook. Get lost, dude! -What about our car? -Go! I'll call the police. Go away! -Fucking dirty scoundrel! -You idiot! -Asshole! Go away! Fucking wanker! -Fuck off! Filthy redneck! Jerk! Your PIN code, please. INSUFFICIENT FUNDS It says "Insufficient funds." Fucking thieves. I can't believe it! They have stolen from me. Fucking piece of shit, fucking thief! Give me my money! Where is my money? Give it back! A bunch of losers like you want play me?! Give me the money! Do you hear me? Fucking retard! I didn't withdraw anything from it, you idiot! What do you mean, you didn't withdraw anything? -Miss! Hello! You left without paying! -Just a moment. Give me the money, please. I never cleared anything off it. I filched it before getting in the car. When the fuck was I supposed to withdraw from it? -Mihai! -I didn't, dude, I swear, are you crazy? -I didn't withdraw anything! -Leave the car here. Go get the money. -Come back, you pay and you take it. -I can't leave my car here. Then we call the cops and you deal directly with them. -No, please, no. -Wait. -And the money? -Just a sec. -Yasmine! -Get the hell away from me! -George... -Roxi! -Ana, take that off! -No! I'm asking you nicely. Trust me. Take that off, you hear me? Pretty please, come on, take it off. Dude, please, trust me, come on! Hi, Mom, Dad! How are you? -Hey. On the road, as you know. You? -Hey! I have a small problem. I kinda ran out of money and I thought maybe you could send me some. I thought you called us for something far more important. -Like what? -You don't know? You ran away from home two days before the finals. To the seaside. And you're calling us now just because you need money? But I didn't run away! I just went with the girls for a little walk and... Cut the bullshit because we know everything. It's the last mistake you made. Seriously, Daddy. What have I done so bad? What did you ever want, that we didn't give you? Didn't we give you everything? Everything! You didn't give me everything. You gave me money and that's it. That's it! Do you have any idea how hard we work? How much time we spend on the road for you? For that money? It's not money I need from you, OK? Very good, because I canceled your credit card. If you embarrass us and flunk the finals, we will take you with us to Monaco and you'll never see Bucharest again. Call your grandfather to help you with this. We have to hang up, OK? Idiots! -What happened? Did you get it? -No. -Then I'm calling the cops! -No, please, I beg you! Wait just a second, I'll call my mom. Obviously! When you need her, her phone is off. Yasmine! You said we can leave the car until we get the money, right? -Yes. -OK. Thank you! -My phone is dead. -Look into the drawer. There's something to charge it with. I'm very sorry, I won't go anywhere near the dog! Do it, because we need the phone! Come on, he won't do anything to you. -Move aside! -I'll talk to him! -Stay! Talk to him, then! -Don't you do nothing to Ceci, OK? Stay put. And all these are also from Ceausescu's time? Those are Ana's nonsense. -What, Ana sings? -She sings from time to time, poor thing. Music is not what she needs. I tried to talk this nonsense out of her, but she doesn't mind me. Her poor mother sang too. It didn't do her any good. -Does she have any talent? -So what if she's talented? -What difference does it make? -Oh, my, I am in Ceausescu's bus... and I have the feeling he's driving it. There isn't any charger here. -You can't find it? -No. -You grab the wheel, I'll search for it. -Yeah, right, and pass again near this? -Move, please, we need the phone! -No. BUCHAREST OR CONSTANTA Fucking fuck! I think we could pull it off, if we put on display some more presentable chicks. Be careful, it's the second strike. At the third you get smacked. I think we could pull it off if you also tried to stop something. You can't possibly think you're coming with us. No? -We won't all fit in a car. -Yeah, but what if we get a car first? I seriously doubt you'll succeed. Yeah, right! Dude, it's friggin' hot! -I'm thirsty. -Suck a seashell. Is that from LALA Band? Stop that whistling already, please. Didn't you hear me? -Check this out! I can't believe it! -I like what you wrote on you, man. -Uncle, is there such a city, L.A.? -Yeah, dude... Los Angeles. Oh, Las Angeles... So, where are you guys headed? -To Bucharest. -We're not going that way. -Constanta, then? -Yeah, but we have to make a detour. - We have to drop off the watermelons. -It's OK for us. -So you'll take us? -Well, hop on! -Thank you! -Such nice girls. Ready! If you get hungry, you can have a watermelon. Mihai! You guys musicians? No. We girls are pupils and they are thieves. We are students! Come on, we're all a bit rascally here... it's tradition. I saw the guitar, that's why I was wondering. Ana is a musician. -No, I'm not. -Yes, she is. -You know how to sing? -Yes... So why don't you indulge us with a little tune, the radio's out anyway. -I'm not sure... -Come on, pretty please? Girl, he's wearing cool sunglasses! We'll talk at the final exams. I want to lie down In a poppy field I don't want to go insane When I realize That there's no one beside me I want you to forgive my forgetfulness Not knowing what you're doing Let me see myself between glass walls Just me, myself and I I'll take the first train out of here To search for my sea A bottle of wine in my hands And an out-of-tune guitar I'll sleep wherever I can And I'll listen to my horizon What are you doing with this oversized whale in our beautiful tourist village, national landmark, Vama Veche? Allow me to greet you with respect, Mr. Commander. I realize that I bothered you, because I was wrong. You didn't bother me. You are bothering an entire village, which right now is having fun at the beach, OK? We protect the tourist! -I didn't realize! -Check this out, a hammer and a sickle. Where do you think you are, in a documentary about communism? -Your ice cream, sir. -Mr. Commander, enjoy the ice cream! He's just like Ceausescu, I'll be damned... Please, allow me to retire. I was wrong, I realize it. I made a huge mistake. But I never realized. I thought I'm not taking the street. Do you understand? I thought I was just going on. -That you're not taking the street? -Yes. So I thought! Are you tripping? Have you been drinking? Oh, my... anyway... -Start writing the report. -What report? Gosh! I'm fried. Bro... what the fuck? -I can't believe it! -Dude, I got sunburned. -We're fucked. -It hurts. Roxi. I can't believe it! -It's terrible. -You should see your face, dude! Just a second. Are we there? Well, can't we rest for a bit? If you want, tonight you can stay with us. Spend the night? For you girls we have an empty room, and us boys, we'll manage something. -We'll squeeze a little. -Whoa... what are you doing, bro? Mircea, what did I tell you? Didn't I tell you to lay off strangers? How can I trust you? He grabbed my ass. -But what did I do, uncle? -Hey, Heckle and Jeckle! Didn't you say you were going to Constanta? -And we are going. Tomorrow! -What? -And now we are where? -In Vama, where else? -Fuck! -What the fuck? In Vama? That's in the opposite direction! -Well, who doesn't want to go to Vama? -We don't?! -Thank you for nothing! -You melon shaggers! -Let's try hitchhiking again. -And end up in Timisoara, what the fuck? Good thing they didn't cross the border to Moldova! Dude, it's Sunday! Surely someone is going to Bucharest! So what are we doing? Tomorrow we have the finals. God, why did I not listen to my dad? -We need to get money somehow. -Well... do your thing... -No! Nobody steals anymore! -And what do you want us to do, Ana? Dude, I have an idea! I BET I CAN DRINK YOU UNDER THE TABLE -What did I tell you, bro? -Dude, I found it! In someone else's pocket. Man, I wanted to help, but they didn't let me, what could I have done? Man, she fell asleep. It's raining? 103 and a couple of coins. Not nearly enough for a couple of tickets and a bag of snacks. You're in luck, your bro here has brains. Easy, boy... -Let's go, quickly! -Wait just a sec. Ceausu Nicolae... Like Ceausescu, as I said. Son of Con-stan-tin and Paul-ina. It's like that singer, Inna. Is there something bothering you? Tell me, so I know. Well, couldn't you be called Ionescu, like I am? What kind of a name is this? -It's my name, it's my name! -Write the statement, OK? Do I write with capital letters or normal letters? With your own letters. Son of... I won't write no statement anymore! I don't give a shit about your statements. Do you understand? I didn't do anything and I want to go now! Mamaia One, should I come over? Mamaia One. Don't stir! Over! Finish the statement this second. If not, I'll cut all the tires of that damn thing that got us into this shit. Clear? Mamaia Two. This is one of those ball-breakers. It's obvious, boss! What is your biggest dream? Write it and send it to heaven! No hoax! Fulfill your greatest desire! Lanterns! Get lanterns! -Lanterns! -Get lanterns! Lanterns! Get lanterns! Roxi! Let's write one, too! No, let's sell it! Come on, let's write one, maybe it'll come true! -OK, let's do it! -Let's! MAKE IT IN TIME FOR THE FINALS BE WITH GEORGE! -What did you write? -You can't tell. No! Really? Not to make it in time for the finals? Yours is something like "Be with the history teacher"? STAY FRIENDS FOREVER That's so cute! Girls, are you ready to launch some lanterns? Yeah! Everybody! Where's the fire, why the rush? Unbelievable. Here we are like a couple of morons while real criminals are roaming free outside. -Oh, shut up already! -But I can't believe it! I can't believe it. Forgive me, please, for dragging you into this. Why? You were right. I should have been strict with her! I was strict with mine, and what good did it do me? At least you were kind to her, now she'll visit you more often. And you think yours won't? From where? From America? It will be OK. Where did you get these lanterns from? We bought them from eBay. I swear. Ten cents apiece. But do you have papers to sell them? Well, we didn't sell anything. We gave them away for free. People there said otherwise. And we tell you we didn't sell anything. Please, I'm begging you, let us go. We didn't do anything! Tomorrow we have the finals. I cannot be arrested. If I have a crinimal record, they'll withdraw my scholarship in America. And these finals are scaring you so much that you're shaking? I took them three or four times already. More likely, you snorted something. Or did you shoot up? Show me your arms! Maybe you got knocked up here, on the sand. Did you get your period? Do you find it funny? How does vandalism sound to you? Or a fine because you don't have any ID on you. Jean, let them have some fun, buddy. They're in a tight spot because of these finals. My opinion is that you've pilfered these papers from people's homes. -But we didn't steal anything! -No. That's what they all say in the beginning. "I didn't steal." You're even trading them illegally, and without proper documentation. And when I look at these three girls here, I belive you pimped them around the beach. -No. -Sir, we are good lads. Look... -Handcuffs for this one, OK? -Yes. Give them paper and pencil. Write in big capital letters all you've pilfered, all you've done. Nice and clear, since you need to take these finals now anyway. -Take their phones away, OK? -Yes. Take the finals! -Come! -Let me check-in, sir. You can stick those lanterns! What if my dad doesn't let me back home... Do you think he's looking for me? -Obviously. -Maybe he reported me missing. Ana, I'm begging you, stop! If only we're lucky and they don't find anything worse. Oh, boy, you steal credit cards. They're gonna think we do too! -We do not... -Like I believe you? I'm gonna be a pathetic loser. Now I totally destroyed my dad. I'm the worst kid in the world. I'll fail the finals and face prison and I will never fulfill my dream. Ana, do you know what my dream is? To go to the moon. And I'll do it. How? I don't know. But I'll do whatever I can to get there. If that means stealing to build my spaceship, then that's what I'll do. If I have to put up with everybody laughing at me till I get to launch it, so be it. All I care about is getting up there. Sooner or later, I would have ended up here anyway. I'm not good at anything, anyway. Didn't you say you wanted to study Journalism? -No. I don't have any talent. -Eh, you have no talent! You take pictures and they are very cool. Instagram bullshit. Everyone takes them. You take them differently. I like them. If only we had a phone now... You think I let them have my phone, dude? -No. -Come on, dude! -What? -You kept it in there... What the fuck, dude? Write a text message. Chop chop. Help. Full stop. Seriously. Full stop. I'm at the police station in Vama. You're by yourself You're anxious You can't find your path To follow Don't act rashly, think carefully What you want to do with your life When you're in the dark Search, search for light And this will surely, surely help you That is Ana. That's Ana. I recognize her voice. Her mother wrote this song. I think you need to sleep a little. I'm telling you! I'm really telling you! Ana! Surely will help you Ana! Ana! Dad?! -How could it be your dad, Ana? -Ana... How could your dad be speaking through the walls? -Ana! -How did you know where we were? -Where else could you end up? -Mom?! Roxi, what have you done? We played with some lanterns and an accident happened. And we had no ID on us. Dad, please forgive me. Dude, these damn corns are killing me. Why did you call for me? -Well, these guys are getting nervous. -Nervous? Did you get me mints? -Didn't you go get them instead? -Me? -Didn't I tell you to get them? -I never ask you for anything! It was his turn! Tell me, buddy, why do you fret like this? This is mockery. What, did I kill somebody? -Who gave you permission to get out? -Calm down! -Take your hands off me! -What's the story? If you don't release these kids at once, you will have all the press and TV on your hands. How will you answer them for arresting some kids who lit some lanterns? Hands off, sir! In here, I am the television and the press! -Perhaps. Open up immediately! -What's your business with these kids? -One of them is my daughter! -And mine. So you have a daughter together. -Not together, but it doesn't matter. -What does it matter? What does it matter?! Move over! -I can't believe this... -This is the girl? -This is the girl... and yours? -I can't believe this... So this one, whose is she? So you have two girls, sir! -Oh, boy! Kids, the finals! -Oh, my... What finals? After two years of catastrophic results... -Morning, sir! -Thank you! You, get over here. What finals? The Minister of Education doesn't make any predictions... Why the hell is everybody so scared of these finals? I took them three times and I am still not afraid of them! Come on! I can't believe this... Come on, baby, come on. Come on, dude! -What are you doing? -I came to help you. That's not what I meant when I said I needed help. I know. I think I have a solution for the finals. -How? -You'll see... -You know that everybody is here, right? -So what? Well? I thought you were brave! -I can't believe it. We missed it. -Hello, what's happening? -What's up with you? -We went to the seaside. There was a bomb threat, but we should begin the exam any minute. All bomb alerts follow the same pattern. It starts with an anonymous call. Then comes the panic when people notice counterterrorism and pyrotechnical troops. Fortunately, all bomb alerts proved to be false. The authorities take these threats very seriously, as they could result in the loss of human lives. So what? FINAL EXAMS, ROMANIAN LANGUAGE JUNE-JULY 2014 First day of finals, bitches! A young talented artist. Well done, baby! Beautiful and talented. United to save Rosia Montana. Together, we save Rosia Montana. I was told "Don't run away from home" but I didn't know why. Keep an eye on your parents! Good job, Brain! The senate of Romania is rejuvenated. Old habits die hard. See you tomorrow, at the exam... History repeats itself. Stay that way! We're coming soon.
