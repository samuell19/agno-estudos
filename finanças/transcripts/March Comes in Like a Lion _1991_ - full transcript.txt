There was a boy and his sister. The girl... adored her brother and hoped to be... his lover someday. One day, the boy lost his memory. The girl decided to be his lover... until he regained his memory. Between the seasons of ice and flowers... lies March, a time of storms. Mitsuo, what's keeping you? Hurry up! See you. Did you find your brother? "I'm waiting for you outside." A wedding? Been to a wedding? That's right. Forgot to give this. No, don't pay me. Can't attend your wedding, so... Thanks. Hey. What? Let's have fun. Today's my birthday. How old are you? It's Ice's first birthday. "Characteristic: Amnesic" "Characteristic: Liar" Yuzo... ...Yasujiro... ...Sadao... Sadao... ...Shun'ichi... ...Masashi... Haruo... Haruo. Ready to go? A real hospital bed. Who are you? I'm Ice, your lover. Let's go. Yes. Yes. This is it. Hey, miss. Apartment 508. Pay up. Must leave in 2 months. Don't complain. He can't be your pimp. No, he isn't. Slept with him. No, but I'm going to. Thanks. Did I say anything? No. Are you hungry? Let's go eat. Shall I cook? Let's go. Come on. Are you all right? Funny. Numb? Which leg is numb? Once upon a time there was a boy... who loved motorcycling. As he rode through a mountain pass one night... a white rabbit suddenly came out. He swerved to avoid the rabbit... and crashed into the siderail. Both the boy and his bike turned over. The rabbit ran to the boy. The boy smiled and said... "Are you all right, Bunny?" Then he died. The moon was shining bright. The rabbit found sunglasses near the boy's body. He put them on... not because the moon was bright... but wanted to hide his tears. Grilling mackerel. They're having curry. I know this smell. What was it? Can you remember? Persimmons. Haruo, help me up. It's delicious. Can I go first? Yes. It's dark and scary. Haruo, hold my hand. Please... Come in. Yes. Now I remember what that smell was. Egg-cake with soy and sugar. It was your favorite, Haruo. On a full moon night... the rabbit took some flowers to where the boy died. The rabbit met a girl there. The girl was... had been the boy's sweetheart. The girl had been the boy's sweetheart. The rabbit and the girl became friends. They promised... to meet there again when the moon was full. The rabbit brought flowers and berries for the girl. The girl baked cookies for the rabbit. They sang, chatted and danced... all night long. That's all. I want to shampoo my hair. Have a good day, dear. Take care. Hello. We have to buy some food. All right, Haruo? Hello. Hello. Stop it. It'll be crooked. How many times have I said this? The first time you gave me a hair cut... Wasn't it in Yokohama? No, when you brought home that funny bicycle... Kawasaki. Not a bicycle. It was a... a motorcycle. Is that so? You don't know anything. Interesting? Stop it. It'll be crooked. Granny. Now, cheese. Here. Here. Just a little. Let's toast. Cheers. Cheers. Where's the puppy? Someone wanted it. That's good. It was kind of you to keep us company. We had a great time. I'm glad to hear that. It's nice. What is? To be old like you. Shouldn't think of such thing. You can only grow old... if God permits you to. And you have to take time to be old. God'll be angry. We shouldn't waste it. Cheers. Granny. How can we be like you and your husband? What do you mean? This is a serious question. How can you get old without losing love? Is there some secret? I'll show you. See this? What is it? Don't tell anyone? It's poison. Some 40 years ago... we promised each other... we'd enter the coffin... together. If one dies, the other should... drink this. How romantic. I lied. This won't kill you. Shall we have tea? The tea'll get cold. Sit next to grandpa. Closer, Haruo. Okay, smile. I remember. I know it. This feeling. It hurts. What do you know? I know this feeling. I know it. That was scary. I felt it. I felt it. I really felt it. Haruo, suppose... suppose you regain your memory. Don't say anything. Just leave. Go somewhere. It's chow time. Hey, it's chow time. Let's eat For you. What? A gift. For me? Thanks. Did you buy this? That old man told me girls love this. Thanks. I'll wash you. I want to kiss you a lot. I want to cry a lot, too. Okay, I'll cry first. "Bonus" Want it? Take it, before it breaks. Haruo. These are okay. Don't take home... kitchen things. Thank you. He sings that well. I always love listening to it. Listen to her. I sang it here for the first time. Liar. You always sing it. You always sing it when you're drunk. No wonder I don't remember. If I get this drunk, how can I? I forget everything. Hey, is he new? Yes, he is. This is Haruo. Masayo and Mari. How do you do. They're college girls. He's quiet. Not like your other colleagues. Watch out. Might be deceptive. The dangerous type... you know. It's true. Want to sing? No thanks. Watch it! "Want to sing"? Watch your language. He's very special. Special? Listen well... Masayo, give me this. His Majesty is amnesic. You're kidding. No, really. Far out! I told you. Hey, he's amnesic. Madam, he's amnesic. He's a friend of mine. Mitsuo, how many times must I tell you? Hurry up and switch off the TV. We're going shopping. Hello, Natsuko. Hi. What is it? Did anyone come here last night? Last night? I don't think so. Thanks. Mitsuo, hurry up. I'm going. Are you listening? "I'm here." Lend me your comb. Thanks. Want to kiss you. I'm cold. I remember. What? That I loved someone. Not me. I loved someone. Wasn't me. What happened? A nail. Hang on a minute. What's the matter? A nail? Bring the First-Aid kit. Use this. Okay. This should do. It's bleeding now. It'll be all right. Get back to work. The First-Aid kit's coming. Good luck. Take care. Good evening. What's wrong? Tea? Just a minute. The tea'll be ready. I've got some delicious cake. Listen. We made love tonight and I know we'll have a baby. I can feel it. Good night. Hey, that story about the rabbit and the girl... The girl decided to have a baby later. Today, the midwife told me... not to eat popsicles. I can't live without them. The baby is upside-down. Its hips are at my stomach. She said if I eat cold food, its hips will get frostbite. It will be terrible to have a baby... with frostbite. But I still want a popsicle. Okay. Okay. It's your big day. Listen to the baby's heartbeat. Inhale deeply. It's all right. You can do it. Yes, you can do it. You have to inhale in between. You can do it. The baby's trying, too. The baby's trying. Let go now. Don't have to push anymore. Inhale deep and relax. Relax now. Don't push anymore. Let go. Wave your hands. Up... now down. It'll soon be over. We're almost there. Push a little now. Now relax again. I can see the baby's head. The baby's coming. Here it comes. It's your baby. Relax. This is your mother. It went very well. Isn't it sweet?
