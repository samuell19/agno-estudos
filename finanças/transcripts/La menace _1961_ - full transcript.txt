THE MENACE No! You should leave, Inspector. It'd be better this way. The investigating magistrate will be expecting your report as soon as possible. You'll be able to make her talk? I hope so. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, he's gone. It's not true. I swear. And I never lie. Give me your hand. Don't you want me to take your pulse? Everything is all right now. Miss Mathias, according to the inspector, your lies set this drama off. What do you think about it? For him, lying is a vice. For me, it's more of a refuge. If there was no lying, we couldn't dream, would we? Don't you want to answer? No. Why? Because I lie. What do your parents do? - Nothing. - How do you mean, nothing? They are dead. When did they die? My father - when I was a baby. My mother - when I was 10. And since then? I've lived at my uncle's. He needed a housemaid. - Does he live alone? - Yes. What does he do? He was an opera singer and then became an antique dealer. Does he treat you well? He drinks. And when he is drunk? I stand at the foot of his bed and say nasty things to him. Is it a relief? It used to, yes.. And when they accepted you in their gang, - everything changed, didn't it? - That's what I thought. You liked lying before meeting those little smart asses? To be able to lie you need to have someone to lie to. And I was alone. Alone. Alone... MATHIAS - ANTIQUE DEALER FREE ENTRY We shared the same house but not the same universe. I had my dreams, he had his vodka. My dreams disgusted him as much as his vodka disgusted me. He would open a new bottle and then, staring blankly, go up to his ridiculous room and listen to his own recordings from 25 years ago. The sooner he would do it the better I had rather be alone than have him in front of me. He was ruining my life after having ruined his Cousin was a finished man. But had he ever started to be a man? He had surely known love and ambition. But now there was nothing left in him but irony and bitterness. Bitterness for himself, irony towards me. But for me Cousin didn't exist. Quite simply. - Josépha. - Yes, Cousin? The smart asses have not been here yet? You're worried, aren't you? Those fools... The military service will do them good. Dinner is ready. I'm not hungry. I'm never hungry at this hour of the day. It stucked with me from my theatre days. When you are an actor, you don't have dinner. You have supper. Good night. My smart asses. Cousin called them that way. For him, they were hooligans because they were noisy. But they were nice guys. Fill it up, quick. Come on, guys, have fun! What are you doing? - Hello. - Hello, Patrick. Aren't you bored in your cousin's flea market? He's not my cousin, he's my uncle. - Why do you call him Cousin? - He wants me to. Where will you go? We'll grab a bite then go to the pictures. Lucky you. - What are they showing? - Cocteau's "The Beauty and the Beast". Say, can you take me along? Look, Josépha, it's not possible. The others wouldn't understand. You're not a member of the group, you see. I'm sorry. If it were only up to me... - Patrick! - Coming! I could still hear them laughing and shouting after they had left. I would have done anything to be able to go with them, even if only once. But for them their group was everything. Cousin. Where are you going? To the cinema at Saint-Romain. Come on, get in. Displaying the caduceus is compulsory? For doctors, it is. And for chemists? No. Your car smells like a chemist's shop. I like it. He didn't speak. I wondered whether he had recognized me. He was Mr. Savary, our new chemist. He had come recently, and I would go to his shop from time to time. He wasn't looking at me. He was watching the road in the light of our headlamps. There was something in that man that made you freeze inside. I was afraid of his still face. I was afraid of the night that surrounded us. I felt as if we had been locked in a room that we would never be allowed to leave. But I couldn't help liking that terror that was creeping over me. Here we are. Thank you. - Peanuts, Miss? - No, thank you. - Miss? - When did the show start? The intermission is coming soon, Miss. - Two box seats, please. - Very well, Monsieur. Here you are, Monsieur. Two box seats. Since I've invited myself, I'm inviting you as well. Here! Hess runs along the offside line and tries to dribble Wicart. But Saint-Étienne counteracts and gains a clear advantage. We'll have to wait for the 43rd minute for Saint-Étienne to even the score. With Oleksiak's assistance Liron scores a fine goal. In the second half-time Saint-Étienne maintains his push. The left winger Balboa is a revelation of the game. At the 86th minute... Are you looking for someone? No, no. Penalty kick for Monaco, and Biancheri evens the score. Would you like some? No, thank you. The Monacans are not slacking their drive. Biancheri and Hess are attacking. Ludo scores. It's 3 to 2 for Monaco. Saint-Étienne had lost when, at the 114th minute, Roy scores a goal with a corner kick. In the presence of the Monacan sovereign, Mr. Roger Frey presents the cup to Raymond Kaelbel, who then goes back to his teammates to take a lap of honour. This is the first cup won by Monaco. Well, are you coming? - Come on, Jean-Louis, let's go. - Coming. Your tickets, please. Your tickets, please. - Your tickets. - What for? - To show you to your seats. - We've found them. - And what about my tip? - She's so tiresome. You find them funny? Oh, they are just young. Quiet down, will you! - Did you see? - What? - It's the chemist. - Look at them. They do look funny, these two. What would she want with that chemist? Say, Bardot of Vaucresson, you aren't jealous by any chance? What's wrong? Nothing. Josépha... What? It's a beautiful name. You should be watching. Oh, I am. A beauty, isn't it? Hey, Minouche. Excuse me, Monsieur. I came on my bike. My mother wouldn't let me come. - That's silly. You missed a good chunk of the film. - Too bad. The ticket saleswoman is gone. I didn't buy a ticket. What did I miss? A lot of stuff. Hey, you! So, my dear Monsieur? You are stealing my roses. You are stealing my roses. It so happens that this simple theft - is punishable by death. - Your Lordship, I didn't know! I meant no harm. I just wanted to pick a rose for my daughter. Don't address me as "Your Lordship". I'm called "The Beast". I dislike compliments. Don't try to understand. - Are you crazy? - Josépha, please... - ...to prepare to die. - Your Lordship... - Again! Why did he have to do something so loathsome? I was disappointed and disgusted. I felt regret. I regretted everything. My running away from home, my meeting Mr. Savary, his impudence and even my own indignation. I ran away like a fool but I was afraid. For a moment, he had looked like a madman. I also regretted seeing my smart asses in the cinema. Without their scooters, they'd lost most of their glamour. Once again I was utterly lonely. And yet, that night something changed for me. Nobody had said my name quite like Savary a moment ago, at the cinema. "Josépha." What are you doing here? You left the cinema? Has Miss lost her driver? She's doing the Paris-Strasbourg race. It's getting cold, the nights are chilly. What the hell are you doing? Come on. - Get on. - No. - Don't be silly. - No. - Get on, I tell you. - Leave me alone! Josépha! - Well, you coming? - No. - Come on. - No. - OK? - OK. - Patrick? - Yes? What must one do to become a member of the group? Nothing. How do you mean, nothing? Well, nothing. You have to be someone. - What does it mean? - To be someone you have to do something. Thierry, it'll be 15 francs for Madame. Thank you, Madame. Thank you, Madame. Hello. Hello. Well? I'd like some toothpaste. - What brand? - I don't know. A good one. I'd like to talk to you. Thierry. Go to the laboratory and close the steriliser. Is it accurate? Yes, but not when you're holding this. I'm sorry about last night. - May I take some? - Yes. How does this thing work? I've never been on the other side of it. - Say... - Yes? Could you lend me 1,200 francs? New francs? Come on. Go on, come. - Is she your wife? - Yes. Does she live here? No. We live in a villa not far from here. I can give you the address? Why? So? Well, this money... It's a lot, isn't it? Too much. At least, for a film show. - A very expensive box seat. - Oh! You think it's because of last night? What do you think I am? Go on! - What is this? - My savings book. I have 200,000 francs but I can't draw any money from it before I'm 18, unless I have permission. But my uncle won't give it to me. I'll be 18 in three months. But I need this money now. Money for what? I can't tell you. Why are you asking me? I thought you might have it. And if I don't want to? You don't want to? OK, wait a moment, little girl. Mr. Savary! Thank you! I had been waiting for that moment the whole day. That mysterious room was where Cousin piled up his most valuable bric-a-brac. When I was a little girl I used it as a hiding place. For hours on end I would weave a dream around each object. But that evening I came there to see something new and alive. My motorbike was fantastic. Elongated and lowered frame, oscillating rear suspension, 3-speed VAP engine, telescopic fork. I was broken, exhausted, black and bruised all over, but I was happy. I had succeeded in taming my motorbike. I was ready for my grand entrance. Hello, Josépha. - Hello. - The motorbike is yours? - Yup. - Why didn't you buy a scooter? Why not a bicycle? What would Mademoiselle like? - A whisky Coca-Cola. - OK. - It's a 125? - No, a 110. - One whisky Coca. - Coming up. Elongated and lowered frame, oscillating rear suspension, 3-speed VAP engine, telescopic fork, fairing with built-in toolbox. - How much? - 4 francs. A weird little thing. I'd be afraid to ride it. It's not much faster than our bikes, you know. How fast does it go? At maximum speed. Works beautifully. Ignition! - What are you doing here? - I saw your car on the road. That's why you needed the money? It's a beauty. Aren't you afraid to ride it? - No. - Be careful. Lovers are a beautiful sight, don't you think? Hello? Yes. Who is speaking? Yes, a moment. Josépha! I'm here, Cousin. It's for you. The notary's son. Hello? Yes. A moment. Josépha, - it's agreed. - What's agreed? You're now a member of the group. Josépha? Josépha? Yes. We had a vote. It was unanimous minus one vote. Who was against me? I can't tell you. It's a secret. - Tell her about tonight. - Oh, yes. Say, Josépha, there remains a little formality. What is it? A new member must give a reception. A reception? A little party. Something to bring everyone together. You see what I mean? Well, are you coming? - No? - Yes. Give me a drink, children, I adore drinking while having a bath. Oh, no! Stop it! Stop tickling me! - How funny they are! - Are you glad to be one of us? Yes, but something worries me. What? That's enough! - Enough already. - My poor fat darling. Here, I'll give you my heart. "S" as in "Sylvie". It's great at your place, Josépha. Listen to me. Listen to me! Who voted against me? Guess! You did! - Bull's eye! - How did you guess? That was easy. The antipathy is mutual. That ties up down! Ties us? You really think so? My being here annoys you that much? You bet! And you're not really a member yet. More like a trainee. Time will tell! - Am I right or not? - Enough with your rubbish, Sylvie! - My rubbish? - Cut that out, will you? Stop it! So, what shall we do now? What will be our reward if we get the rose? The rose. I suggest a real prize. A kiss. OK? OK. Everyone knows the rules? You can use only your teeth. Ready, Josépha? Take your place, Josépha! Get set! Go! Stop, you bandits! Look out, Josépha! Little bastards! Stéphane... Let's get moving, children. Let's meet at the lock at 9. - Why? - To see the lock. You know, I won back then. - You cheated. - You really think so? A little. - No, Stephan. - What? - You can't. - Are you sure? - I am. You're right, Patrick. - Good night. - Goodbye, Josépha. Monsieur, what time is it, please? - 10 o'clock. - Thank you, Monsieur. Do you have a cock? - A cock? - A weathercock. Josépha, bring the weathercock. It's stunningly ornamental. Excuse me, Madame. Where are you going? Josépha! Do you think it'll go well with the Napoléon III furnishings? A cock is well suited with everything. - What's wrong? - Get on, quick. - Where are we? - It's our headquarters. - Have you heard the news? - What news? - Have you or haven't you? - No, why? Sit down. Sylvie is dead. - What? - Yes. - Come off it. - Murdered. Murdered? By whom? That's what we're wondering. She was found strangled. Can you imagine? Sylvie... It can't be. If I get my hands on the bastard who did this... It happened this morning. We'll be interrogated for sure. - You think so? - Of course. We were together all the time. That's what the cops start with. What did you do this morning? Me? I came by your place but you weren't there. - I went for a walk. - Say, - did you go to the lock? - No, why? I went for a walk in the forest. - That's where Sylvie was strangled. - At what time? - What? - At what time did you take your walk? - You think I looked? - Approximately. - I don't know, between 9 and 10. - Didn't you see anything? - The forest is large. - You heard nothing? Leave her alone. If she had seen or heard anything she would say. I'm not so sure. I say I'm not sure because Josépha is the kind of girl who doesn't do like everybody else. Is it true, Josépha? If you knew the killer, you wouldn't tell? Well, I say... We asked you a question. Wouldn't you denounce the killer if you knew him? - As you can see. - You're joking, aren't you? I saw him. - I know who he is. - No kidding? It knocks your socks off, doesn't it? While you're busy playing on your scooters I look around - Tell us who he is. - Never. Look, Josépha, we're neither boyscouts nor hooligans just friends. It's true, we're friends. And when something bad happens, we stand together. Speak up, or you're out, Josépha. I had seen nothing. I knew nothing. A the time of the murder I was at the lock, being stood up by Stéphane. But they were so idiotically insistent. And I needed to surprise, to astound them. I had to throw them a name. And I had one, a name that imposed itself on me. Irresistibly. It was getting larger in my head. I couldn't hold it back. And they were ready to believe anything. So... But you must swear. Swear me you won't say anything. - OK. - Sworn! We swear! Swear that you won't tell it to anyone. - To no one! - We swear. Very well. Miss... I'm sorry, Josépha. I know we swore, but my mother... I couldn't help telling her. It's better that way, you know. They say she wasn't only murdered. Sit down. Well, my dear... OK. You must sign. Thank you, youngsters! You may go now. Hold on, Miss, we still need you. Mr. Savary. Hello, Josépha. - Sit down, M. Savary. - No, thank you. No, no. Please read this aloud, Gauthier. "On the morning of September 4 I went for a ride on my motorcycle." Don't you ride a scooter, Miss Mathias? No, it's a real motorcycle. "While going down the trail perpendicular to the main road I saw a man running under the trees. He seemed in a panic. I recognized that man. It was Mr. Pierre Savary, the chemist." - But that doesn't make any sense! - Go on! "I noticed that his clothes were untidy. He was so agitated that he didn't notice me. I didn't pay any attention to the incident and only when I learned about the murder of my friend and the place where it had happened did I connect the two events." Why are you lying, Josépha? You know that it isn't true. Come now, Josépha, you can't do this. You can't just say things like that. You don't realize. Do you know what you are doing? Do you know what it's called? Perjury! Josépha! Look at me! Mr. Savary. Do you insist that none of this is true? It's all lies! Lies! Damned lies! Lies! Lies! Lies! Mr. Savary. Mr. Savary, before summoning you here we investigated. We established that on every Monday morning, your shop being closed, you go jogging in the forest. Is this correct? - But I... - Is this correct? Yes, I often do it. But I'm not the only one. Sure, young girls go there too. - But it's ridiculous! - I don't think so. What did you do yesterday morning? Well? - I went for a walk. - Where? - In the neighbourhood... - Where exactly? - Well... - In the forest? Miss Mathias, do you stick to your statement? - Excuse me? - Yes. Thank you. That'll be all for today. Josépha! My smart asses had betrayed me. My lie became revolting, but I couldn't step back. I was deliberately sinking in my own nightmare. - Why did you stop? - We'll finish on foot. It will last longer. You were great at the police station. Yes, you were. You shouldn't regret anything, you know. The cops would have nicked that chemist eventually. They are not particularly clever, but they are stubborn like... That's why they are also called mules. Walking is fun, - don't you think? - Yes. - Why didn't you come to our date? - How do you know I didn't? - Well... - You weren't there either. Well, yesterday you asked me whether I had gone there. It means that you weren't there yourself. Yes, it's true. Why? Because of Patrick. In the group there can be no love affairs. - Love affairs? - Yes, love affairs. Do these words scare you? And kisses, are you scared of them too? Give me a kiss, then. It's funny, you were not interested in me before. Well, you know... Come on, kiss me. How lazy you are! Shall we make another date? A real one, just for two of us? - Tomorrow, at 5 PM, at the lock. - No, not the lock. Near the golf course? Sold. You're funny. - Why? - I don't know. You're something else. Ciao! YOUNG GIRL SAW MURDERER-CHEMIST "Someone had seen the criminal. Yesterday morning young Josépha Mathias, wanting to go for an outing in the forest, decided to take her motorcycle out." "...to take her motorcycle out." So, you took your savings book for that? - Well, yes. - But tell me... I didn't give you permission. - Where did you get the money? - I borrowed it. From whom? - A friend. - From whom? - A friend. - I, Julien Mathias, have a niece who rides a motorcycle and sullies my name in the press. It's not your name, Cousin. It's mine. Hello. - You came early. - I drove fast. I drove slowly but I had left early. I don't know why. I don't like waiting. - What's wrong? - No. So silly, I've been thinking about it all night. Too bad. Did you see the newspaper? You're damned photogenic. What's wrong with you? You see, down there? - The car? - It's Mrs. Savary. - What does she want? - I don't know. She's following me. - Do you want me to talk to her? - Oh, no. - But we must know... - Please don't. Shall we go and meet the others? - Already? - Yes. OK. It's not my fault that she married her husband. - Where are you going? - Home. I got away from the smart asses. Suddenly they became unbearable. Watching them tormenting Mrs Savary, I had seen them as they really were. Great silly oafs who thought they were smart. And I had dared do all that for them I was breaking down. I kept thinking about Savary. How could I forget about him, with that haunting car and that impassive woman who was following me? I wanted to finish this. Well? - Get in, please? - I have nothing to say to you. Well I do. Get in. - I don't have time. - It'll only take a moment. - Do you know who I am? - Yes, Mrs. Savary. You are Josépha. It's a beautiful name. You see, Josépha, first of all, I want to tell you that I think I understand. I think I understand why you lied. You're very lonely, aren't you? You have only your little friends, so you cling to them. You wanted to impress them. That's why you got the motorbike, isn't it? Tell me, Josépha, have you thought about the consequences of your lies? I didn't lie. Josépha! I didn't lie. I didn't lie. I didn't lie. I saw you yesterday at the lock. - You'll tell the truth to the police. - Oh, no! No! No! No! Yes, you will. You see, I know Pierre well. I've known him for a long time. He was a student. I was working at a laboratory. We lived in the same little hotel. Near the Odéon Theater. Rue Racine. He was shy. During two years, he made do with greeting me in the hallway. Then one night he knocked on my door. He did it to ask me to marry him. Pierre has been interrogated by the police for 24 hours. And you know that he isn't a murderer. What has been going on inside this head of yours? How old are you? 18. A little less or a little more? A little less. You know, my husband won't file a complaint. - A complaint? - Yes, against you. He could, but he won't. Do you believe me? Do you believe me? Do you believe me? - Do you believe me? - No! They were all there in that room. I didn't dare say that it wasn't true. They were watching me. Do you understand? I'm beginning to. We know that you are a dirty little liar. What we don't know is when you are telling the truth. - Yesterday, or just now? - Now, I swear. Well, if you swear... Look, the newspaper says the crime was committed between 9 and 10 AM. - Is this correct? - It is. So what? Well, between 9 and 10 AM I was at the lock. - Were you? - You can check it. Thank you. I talked to the lock keeper. He's sure to remember me. I spent over one hour waiting for a friend. - He'll tell you. - Gauthier, call Inland Navigation. - Is that the local lock? - Yes, Sir. Connect me to Inland Navigation. Do you know what contempt of court is? - No. - Well, that's what you've done. - How old are you? - 18. - You're lucky. - Hello, Inland Navigation? Hold the line. Lucile. They released him the same day. His wife was waiting for him. They loved each other. - What a story! - Let's go, darling. When I was back at Cousin's, I felt relieved. But my fear suddenly took a different form. I was telling myself that he hated me. I was afraid to see him again and I wanted to. Tell them to get lost at once! Josépha. Josépha! Josépha! Open the door! Open the door, you little bitch! - Josépha, you are nuts! - Don't you hear me? At once! - Josépha, you are nuts! - Open the door! - Josépha, you are nuts! - Open the door! - Will you open it? - Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Josépha, you are nuts! Murderers! Barbarians! Torturers! Fascists! I'm sick and tired of you! I'm fed up! Fed up! Fed up! No! Josépha! Come and have a look! Hey! Come here! - What? - Joséph got away. And Patrick too. Hey, they turned at the corner. - They took the road to the forest. - Shall we go? Yes. Come on, let's go! Where are you going? Don't worry, they may be rough but they aren't mean. - That's enough. - Beat it! - She's one of us. - Go away, Patrick! Look what you did to your friends! Look, I tell you! Come on, get up. - It's strange. - What? Your driving by at exactly that moment. It's not strange. I've just been at your place. Why? - Were they fighting because of you? - Yes. Of course they were. They've lost their star. - Does it hurt? - A little. Still afraid of me? That doesn't look too good. Little jerks. Don't worry about them. They're not worth it. - I don't care about them. - Well then? - It's my motorbike. - Did you have an accident? No. My uncle smashed it to pieces. I don't know what got into him. - We're going to my shop. - Oh, no, there's no need to. We need to clean the wound. I might even have to give you a tetanus injection. Did you accuse me because of the cinema? - No. - Why then? I don't know. Here. Wipe your mug, it's dirty. Is it? No, use this one. Did you know her? Who? - Sylvie. - No. I'd never seen her. - What is it? - Chewing gum. Sylvie would chew some and then shape it into letters like this one. Where are you going? - Close the door. - No. Close the door! POLICE STATION Here we are. Get out. What are you waiting for? Go on, tell them. Well then? Since it's me. Since you're sure. And don't forget the material evidence. Put your hand down. Put your hand down, I won't touch you. See? That's how lies work. I swear it's him. I'm sure of it. Sylvie would always do this with her chewing gum, - and it was in Mr. Savary's car - Stop it! I'm fed up with your stories, you hear? Fed up! Go on, throw away that piece of trash. Come on, throw it! And now get lost. You'll be hearing from me. What did you do to your leg? He had left. I was almost disappointed. What did he say? He slapped me. Don't cry, Josépha. Don't cry, I can't bear it. I had just reported him a second time, and he took me in his arms. Whether he was guilty or not, I only was happy with him At last, I stopped thinking It was nice. - Hello? - Can I speak to Mr. Savary? He isn't back yet. Who is this? The police. Yes? Are you Mrs. Savary? Yes, it's me. What's wrong? Josépha Mathias is up to her old tricks again. I don't understand. She's just accused your husband again. What? She claims to have found in M. Savary's car chewing gum belonging to the victim. Can you imagine? That girl is a mythomaniac, and a raving mad one to boot. Chewing gum in the car? It won't end well if we don't take care of her. I advise your husband to file a complaint. That's our only way to bring the doctors in on the deal. She's an orphan who's been living with her drunkard uncle since she was 12. - Do you know him? - By sight. A former actor. You know the type. Tell M. Savary to drop by tomorrow so we can discuss it all. - I will. - Great. Thank you. My respects, Madame. Hello? Hello, Miss? Give me number 18, please. Is it a patient? Hello, Pierre? Pierre? Pierre, are you there? Who is it? Wrong number. Won't you answer it? No. - Do you think it's necessary? - Yes. Better safe than sorry. You never know. Lie down. - Will it hurt? - This isn't your first injection. No, but I still don't like them. - Are you tired? - Yes. What did they do to you at the police station? They have questioned me for hours. Go on, turn over. They locked you in? I would have liked that. I was exhausted. Give me a hand. - Did it hurt? - No. You're wimpish. Hold this. - Say... - Yes? Do you think they'll catch him? - Who? - The murderer. Of course. One day he'll try to do it again. He's a sick man. - A sick man? - Obviously. It's an ordinary case of a localised psychosis. It must be someone who feels suffocated by his environment. It's killing him. A day comes when he can't take it any more. He needs to do something. Doesn't matter what. Why did you run away from the cinema that night? I don't know. I didn't think then. - Did I scare you? - Yes. And when I kissed you, what did you think? Nothing. I liked it. Being kissed by a man or being kissed by me? Both. And what if I did it again? No. - Why? - You shouldn't. - And what if I loved you? - Me? Why do you suppose I never said anything after all you had done to me? Or do you think I give money to every girl who asks me? Come on, Josépha, use your head. Don't cry. Finally, you were right. You thought you were lying but you actually told the truth. Everything will go back to normal now. You were subjected to a very violent shock. But you'll forget sooner than you think. I don't want to forget. We'll help you, Miss Mathias. But you'll have to help yourself to come back to a normal life. Normal life? Don't you understand? Don't tell me... What? That you love that... that man. I don't know.
