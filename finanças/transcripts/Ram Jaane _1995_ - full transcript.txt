- Footpath, get me a pack of cigarettes. - Right away. - Hey, Footpath! Get me some eggs. - Right away. - Hey Footpath! - Right away. Why does everybody call you Footpath? - Because I was found there. - But you must have a name. I'll ask the bread vendor in the evening. Tell me one thing. Later. - Did you hurt anyone today? - No. Here, eat this. Now ask what you want to know. What's my name? - Ram Jaane (God knows). - Great! Hey Murli, Balu, Aslam! To hell with all of you! You would all tease me, that I do not have a name! Now I've come to a proper house. - And I've got my name too! - What is it? Ram Jaane. - Coming to a film? - Got the dough? I just cleared that guy's dues. - So, how will we go? - Stealing. Come on. - There's Bela! I am off! - I'll come with! Heroine! Come watch a film with me. I go to school. I am not useless like you. Footpath! - I had told you my name is Ram Jaane. - Let go of my hair! First say Ram Jaane. - I won't say it! - You won't say it? - You won't say it? Let's go! - Uncle! I will surely avenge this someday. What's the matter? You were screaming just a second back. And now you laugh? What is this politics? Look at your face. Half cream, half clean. What is this politics? I like Bela a lot. - I also like her. - Don't you dare look at her! I've asked my God for her! What the? Murli, run! Ram Jaane, help me! Ram Jaane! - Come on, Ram Jaane. - Rascal! Tell me. Who was with you? Answer me! Rascal! Have mercy on your bones. What theâ€¦? You spat on Constable Chewte! You are so dead. What happened to you? Bela will laugh out loud when she sees me in this shape. But what is all this? My breakfast. They hit you instead of feeding you here. - They beat you so much? - They asked for your name. But I didn't tell them, that's why... Why did you take the thrashing for me? This is my style. Live and die with pride. Finish! Father. Why did Ram Jaane get thrashed for my sake? Giving pleasure to others gives a lot of happiness. Is that why you give us free bread? Not for free, my son. I get a lot of love from you all in return. Those who get love from others are very lucky. Then, Ram Jaane is very lucky. God knows. This is Pannu Technicolor. A while back, he ran away from the remand home. Now, he travels in cabs, and smokes imported cigarettes. He's made a lot of money! - Why doesn't anyone catch him? - Who wants to die? - Sameer Sawla will tear him apart! - Who is he? Pannu's boss. He's very dangerous. Haven't you heard of him? How did he run away? Go back inside! Move! Ram Jaane? Did they release you from the remand home? I don't get released. I escape. What if the police capture you again? I know how to escape them. You tell me, what's all this? The bread man enrolled me in school. - With Bela? - She has gone. - Where? - To a hostel. - Why? - He is alone. He couldn't look after her well enough. She will stay in the hostel, study and become a lady. Then he'll marry her off to some rich man. I'll be rich and show them! How? Is Sameer Sawla your father to give you work? Then is he your father to give you work? I liked the boy's answer. It will do for me. Take him under your wing from tomorrow. - Yes? - Sawla, your face is stained! Once again, my Amar, Akbar and Anthony have sullied your face! I have your goods worth 20 lakhs. Will you buy it for ten? Hey, Mirchi! This bastard, Mirchi, will... Is he too hot for you? Tell me. Finish! You talk too much! What's your name? Ram Jaane. My name is Ram Jaane. Tell your boss, Mirchi. His time is finished! Like this damn lighter! What are you looking at? Throw me a match! I ask for a match and you give me bullets? I have two things to tell you. One. I don't like chillies. But, if Mirchi touches my boss' goods, I'll sort you all out. - Give me a match. - Sure. This is a cutout. Where is Ram Jaane? Here I am. Look! Sorry! Sorry! I was only firing to hit the guns. Some people got hit on their own! Amar, your men are no good. The sound of a bullet scares them. Tell them I am very bad. If anyone moves, I'll mow him down! I said, don't move! How many men will I kill? I won't kill any more. Tell all of your men that... Oh, you've spoilt my clothes! If anyone acts smart with me, I'll bury him in the ground! Didn't I make myself clear? Rascal! Where are you going? All your men are finished. You're all alone, but don't worry. I am here with you. I'll talk to you of love. Do you watch films? Who is your favorite hero? Think about him! Remember him! Oh, you survived, you rascal. Ram Jaane, don't kill me! Oh. You're still alive. Amazing! Your name is Amar (immortal), right? You can't die. Go. I free you for your name. Go away. Hey, are you hurt? You can't get hurt. Your name is Amar. Where are Akbar and Anthony? I won't tell them you told me. You can keep this stuff too. I'll tell Mirchi that I took it. You'll be happy, so will I. What do you say? - Say yes. - Yes. Go, it must be Amar. There's something fishy. He's alone. Ram Jaane is seated in the back. Akbar and Anthony are finished. Your name is Amar. You cannot die. But my cigarette won't light up today. Don't fear. Here, light the cigarette. Light it. Everyone says, cigarettes are harmful to the body. The smoke goes into the body, makes noise and the man is... Finished! From today, I am the number one star in the world of crime. Nobody to compete with me. - That Mirchi is just a name. - Only for a few days. I've found the plot to bury him! He too is finished! I don't worry with you around. Where is Technicolor? Putting a little color in his glass. Why are you hiding yourself? Pannu, the cash that I gave you yesterday, hand it over to Ram Jaane. Ram Jaane, the fishermen area is yours now. - Yes? - It's this one. - Who? - Me. Mirchi. - Mirchi on the line. - Ask him what he wants. What's the matter? Finding it too hot? A chilli never feels hot. Only the sick eat food without chilli. You need to add chilli if you want the taste of life. - I am ready for a compromise. - He's ready for compromise. - Should I refuse? - Why? He's not worth making friends. But he's not even worth turning into an enemy! He's right. Give me the line. How do I fry you? In the pan or the cooker? To hell with this! Kill me right now! Let it all end here! Did you come here to say this? I came to say I... I am ready to be a shameless traitor. But I want one crore and a cut in the business. What do you think I am? I'll put a rod through you and roast you in this fire! The days of eating kababs and becoming the Don have gone. I wonder what the color of my blood is, even after earning with Samir Sawla. I still retain my true colors. What's one crore? You couldn't kill Samir Sawla for ten crore! But I won't spare Ram Jaane! Why not? He's not bad. He's saved my life many times, but you know business better. That is up to you, or God. So, Sawla and Ram Jaane? Mirchi will kill both of them? He will give him a technicolored shock. The same way you are going to kill Mirchi. With Mirchi and Sawla gone, I'll be the don. Listen, technicolor, you're playing a very dangerous game. You said you would search each other to check if anyone has arms. Then how will Mirchi get a gun? What? What did you say? "Jhumri has asked for bells from Jhumroo". "But Jhumroo said neither I give bells nor drums". "London to Bombay, Bombay to Kangra. Oh! Oh! Oh!" "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "What's Ramba Samba, Cha Cha Cha? What's Hula hoop? What Rock-n-Roll?" "It's all useless. Why do we need a band?" "One drum and two sweet words. Weigh the eyes in the scales of heart". "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "Let us talk sweet things. Come and sit next to me". "Mix liquor in the water of life" "I will become a snake charmer today, you become a snake and dance". "Open all the doors of your heart". "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "This song and dance is years old". "The whole world has learnt it from India". "London to Bombay, Bombay to Kangra. Oh! Oh! Oh!" "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "You have black hair, your cheeks are very fair". "And to top it, your sensuous walk". "Oh my God, I will die. Don't ask how my heart is". "My condition is very bad. Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Everybody is sitting with their eyes peeled, lest they get robbed". "One astrologer had said that your year will be fine". "Let us see what will happen this year". "Pump up the Bhangra. Pump up the Bhangra". "Dance, my dear, listen to me". "Why just my heart? Ask me for my life". "London to Bombay, Bombay to Kangra". "Oh! Oh! Oh! Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Say anything, do anything". "This world is a market. Friends get sold in it". "We bother about tomorrow later. Come, today let's love a little". "Do not refuse my dear. Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "If you love to live, then be ready to die. My dear, say yes". "The youth comes and goes just once in 100 years". "Let us talk a little. Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "You are alone and I am also alone". "If we both meet, then, It would be a fair". "London to Bombay, Bombay to Kangra". "Oh! Oh! Oh! Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". "Pump up the Bhangra". We finished them all! Sir? Sawla Seth? Chewte. You wouldn't have cried so much when you entered this world. As much as you'll cry today while leaving it. I won't spare you! Why did you kill him? Why did you kill him? I won't spare you! I won't spare you! Why did you kill him? You'll cry for this! You'll cry for this! You'll make me cry? What the...? Have you forgotten the power of my bones so soon? Did you think you could escape me?? Finished! Your bones are finished! They have grown soft. Have mercy on your bones because my bones have grown tougher! See. See for yourself. Finished! Your bones are soft! Pig head! You find my bones soft? If I don't break your bones today, I am not worthy of my name! Finished! Soft bones! Finished! Soft bones! Finished! Soft bones! Finished! Finished! Finished! - Finished! - What the? Shut up! Why are you asking for your death? - Finished! - You are finished! - Finished! - What the...? 303, 715! Take him away! What the...? He said that my bones have gotten soft! What's all this? If Bela sees me like this, you don't even know her. You can't be bailed out. I know. I talked to the lawyer. He says if I become a state witness, I'll be released in two or three years. Take it. - I have one request. - What? Save me. - Why? - I'll settle you outside. When you return, you'll get cooked meat or else, the enemies will take away the honey. And we'll be eating bones! How will you run the business? - Sameer's... - That is mine! It is yours. I'll return it to you with interest later. It's time for the jailer to return. Hey, Pannu! I know you're very sly! But if you act smart with me... - I will... Yes. - Make me Technicolor? I know. As the government nabbed goods worth crores because of Ram Jaane's help, this court takes a lenient view and sentences him to four years of rigorous imprisonment. - "Sa! - Sahil". - "Re! - Rocky". - "Ga! - Gama". - "Ma! - Malu". - "Pa! - Potu". - "Dha! - Dhanna". - "Nee! - Nandu". "Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa". "Sa, nee, dha, pa, ma, ga, re, sa!" "When one note meets another". "That is called a tune". "When a heart meets another". "It is called a union".

Give this heart to me". "Take this paper and a pen". "The tree burns itself in the sun". "But it gives shade to people". "That person is only good". "Who is good to others". "You are not good to me. You are a liar by God!" "You are not good to me. You are a liar by God!" "You are a liar by God!" "My dear, we rule the 52 playing cards". "We don't know about tomorrow but today is ours". "We are jokers, our own servants. We are jokers, our own servants". "Ace, King and Queen!" Rascals, the dregs of society. It's become a daily routine now. Joshi Sir, this is Mr. Murli. The organizer of Apnaghar. We've written about him in our paper. But you probably forgot to mention... that under the guise of housing orphans, this man, has made a house for himself. The land that he has taken over and guards like a snake, that land is worth crores. I've arrested these boys for hooliganism so many times. But he always frees them. Just so that the car of his life travels smoothly. I ask you one question. When you can't reform this gang, why don't you close down shop? Joshi sir, who doesn't know of this man? He has been accused of corruption so many times. But each time, he did something to confuse the people, but this man never left his chair. Just so that the car of his life travels smoothly. I ask you one question. The job of the police is to stop crime. If you can't stop crime, why not shut your police station? Shut up! Here are the bail papers. - Let them go. - Yes sir. I've arranged for you to stay here. Is that all right? Yes. Where is Bela? So he is back? Finished! The monkey turned into a beauty. If I am a monkey, what are you? Monkey. - Where are you going? - The kids must be waiting for me. Have some food before leaving. I've cooked today. Feed it to the one you cooked it for. Hey, Murli! What are you staring at? I was wondering if you were this pretty when you were young. Youth hasn't been kind to you. You're still the same. Footpath! I swear! You say it so well! I am very happy to see you. Me too, pal! Swear? I swear. Remember how you pulled my hair when we were young? I waited for this moment for years! Serves you right! "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "Decorate my hair with the flower of your heart". "On my cheeks, put the color of your love". "Decorate my hair with the flower of your heart". "On my cheeks, put the color of your love". "Let me match my love to your beauty". "Let me match my love to your beauty". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "In this season, my beloved, give me some sign." "Come, let me write this youth in your name". "In this season, my beloved, give me some sign". "Come, let me write this youth in your name". "Write a check in your name and let me cash it". "Write a check in your name and let me cash it". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". "I have loved. Let me enjoy this love for a while". "Throw a kiss in the wind so that I can catch it". What rascals! Where is your boss, Technicolor? Gone to Dubai? Don't know when he'll return? Hope you know your father's name at least. You think you're very smart? Pick his pocket if you have guts. - You act smart. You do it. - None of us have the guts. I'll do it. Hey kid! Careful! Times are very bad. What! Get lost. Move. He took it. 1700 plus change! - Now what will we do? - Eat, drink and watch a film and... Get punched and kicked around! Loafers! Acting smart! - You had to pick my pocket only? - We had a bet. What was the bet? Who will die first? You should have picked someone who doesn't know your den. But how did you know about our den? Is this your den? Rascal! Move it, move it! Your den! We used to play cards here, before you were even born. - Look! - Ram Jaane Murli! Would Murli also play with you? - Then? - Who spoilt him? You rotten kids! Rocky, Sabir, Poltu, Murli is calling all of you. Hey, go tell him, nobody from our gang will come. Why don't you go when he calls? You think you're a big hood! He wants us to play with kids. We get fed up. Then how will you play the game of life? Tell him I'll come to play. All who come will be treated to a film. - Really? - Yes, don't point fingers! Get up! Rascal! I know. It's a foul. We'll play again. Don't scream. Play again. It's a foul. Don't scream. We'll play again. Here, you try to handle them. You like playing football? Come on, I'll play with you. Get up. Come on! There you go. Come along now. Too good. We won! - They cheated. - Why not? Crying when it's your turn? Who won the game? Both of us won. - Then shall we go for the film? - Are you going for a film? - I'll get Murli. You wait. - Murli is coming too? - I too will come. - Take her and go. Here's the money. Go. This movie will be a hit! I mean, you are Sunita's sister. - No. - No! No! - Do you have a problem with 'Yes'? - No. How are you guys? Ram Jaane! How are you man? Hasn't Murli come? I wasn't going to bring him. You refused to watch a film with me when we were young. Hence this game. - This is not fair. - O, Brother. Why did you lie to me? What would you lose if Murli had come? What is it? - I am eating. - Finish all of it. "Stealthily, stealthily". "Stealthily, stealthily". "Oh, Fair girl, let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, Fair girl, let's go stealthily under the shade of Peepul tree". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". "Oh, Fair girl let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, Fair girl let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". "Stealthily, stealthily". "Stealthily, stealthily". "If we love secretly". "If somebody sees us then". "If we love secretly". "If somebody sees us then". "What will happen? Tell me, tell me. What will happen?" "No! No! No! No!" "What'll happen? Tell me. What'll happen?" "Our name will be spoilt a little in the village". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". "Oh, Fair girl let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". "Oh, Fair girl, let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". "Oh, Fair girl, let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, Fair girl let's go stealthily under the shade of the Peepul tree". "Oh, no! A thorn might prick in my foot". - What childishness is this? - Scream, yell. I know it. You're angry with me, right? - Why? - I went for a film without telling you. - With Ram Jaane. You felt bad. - No. Come on, I know you are angry. You felt jealous. But you keep hiding your love. Isn't it? Correct? How many times do I tell you that I don't love you? Whatever your tongue may say, I can read your eyes. Just once, say that you love me. I swear on my life I'll give up the world for you. Giving up the world is very difficult. Give your world to the one whose world is lonely. I have many in my life. Who? Rocky and Sabir? With every child of Apnaghar. Their life should change. That's my only dream. And what about my dream? Ram Jaane. Rascal, Pannu. Yes. Yes, ok. Yes. Yes. Come in. My pal! Ram Jaane. How you been, pal? When were you released? When did I come out? You were the one who was out. Hong kong, Dubai. You've become a big man. It's just show. Only show. Times have changed. Politicians play the game now. I am just a pawn. Just a pawn. Don't be under any mistake. Nothing here belongs to me. You've become very smart. Before I could ask for my cut, you're making things clearer. Cut? What cut? You may fleece others. I'll turn your skin Technicolor! You had promised me that we would be equal partners, right? That's why I stayed in jail for four years. Or else... Or else, I don't really love the food there. Tell me. No, you tell me. Did I refuse? I never denied that. But now, the business is Bhau's. - I have to talk to him. - You talk to anyone. But I want my cut. Finish! And what about my crore? I'll arrange it in two days. I've just returned from Dubai! Come, give me some cash for spending. - Come on! - I am. I am. Hey, is the red Mercedes parked outside yours? - Yes. Why? - I have problems getting around. - The key. - I won't refuse anything. Fill the tank. I'll return on Monday. A man just left with my Mercedes. Finish him off! - Bela, come on. Move it. - Why? No time to waste. Come on. - What happened? - Guests are coming to speak to me. - Not to be spoken before girls. - Bela, go inside. All of you go away. - They have to pay bills. - Later. Come on, get out. Don't look back. Get lost. Ram Jaane, phone. Coming. Close the door. - Ram Jaane here. - Wait a minute. My boss will speak to you. Boss? I'll do one thing, I'll lock up. - Go in the kitchen. - You want to eat fried egg? I want fried brain! You'll only get half a plate of that. Get inside. But the guy who was with you said he wanted fried chicken. Go, go to the telephone booth for his order. Move, you smartass. I'll give you fried brain! Come. Come on. Fast. Ram, Ram Jaane! Hey, Technicolor. Why has your face turned pale by seeing me here? What do you mean? I'll tell you. What, what? What is the matter? Maintain some distance. Don't come close. You sent your men to kill me. What are you talking about man? You didn't? You did not send men to kill me? I swear on my mother. You must've sent them, Pannu. Try to recall. No. You forgetful rascal. I'll remind you. Tell me, did you send them or not? - No. - Did you send them? - Did you or not? - I did. See, you're bleeding. Get up and say it. Get up, carefully. Dust off your clothes. - Didn't you send them? - No. You rascal! Come on. Talk. Talk. Talk! No smart moves. I too will listen. - Talk. - Pannu sir. - Yeah. - Your job is done. Ram Jaane is finished! - Rascal! - Ram Jaane! Forgive your elder brother! Your voice! I didn't know your voice was like a mouse's! Say it once again. Forgive me, Ram Jaane. - Like a mouse! - Forgive me! What a lovely sound! Now get up. Hey. Come on. Get up. Hey, Technicolor. If you were not my childhood pal, then, with great love, I would have turned your skin Technicolor. Don't take those papers. They are very important. I know. Will a smart ass like you keep trash in the vault? Hey, what's in this? Hey, Technicolor. - What's this for? - To escape from the police. - You've become very technical. - Thank you. Shut up! Call Bhau. Call him up! You bloody... Darling, don't take the call. It's the hotline darling. Move. Yes? Yes? Speak up, Pannu. One crore? Tomorrow at ten? I've understood. Who is this? Ram Jaane. - Come on. - Yes darling. But, before that, let me book Ram Jaane's ticket to hell. Hey! What? There's nobody there? Let's check. There's a bomb in the car! Push it away! Hurry up! Sorry. I thought I should make an entry in style. Hey, Bhau, why did you send men out to receive me? I am a very small man. Hey! What are you staring at? Don't you recognize me? It's me. Ram Jaane. Whether God knows or not, I only know this much that the one who looks into my eyes shuts his eyes very soon. Why? You don't look that bad. Sorry. It takes time for me to understand. Did you just threaten to kill me? Tell me. Yes? What are you afraid of? You have already tried once. In any case, I don't really care about death. I am not scared of death. Why should I be scared? I don't love life. I say it with pride! Hit me! Come on! Come on, shoot! You see? I have never run into a man in my life! They're all scared of dying. That friend of yours, Pannu... along with whom you cheat the public and send it to banks abroad. He truly fears death. Bhau, if Pannu dies, you'll be in trouble. But what can I do? I am helpless. If I don't reach him by 11, my men will shoot him. - It's going to be 11. - What? You talk so much! You wasted so much time! I will call them up. Maybe they haven't killed him yet. Hello! Shiv Shankar Dairy Farm. 20 bucks for whole milk and 15 bucks for cow milk. What's the rate of Pannu Technicolor? What color? My milk is white. What? He has turned white! I don't understand what you're saying. Yes! I am speaking from Bhau's place. I see, I see. Then give the order. My order will take some time. If I don't reach by 12, give our guest some hot bullets. Poor thing shouldn't die hungry. You seem crazy! You bloody fool... My men are going mad! Why are you standing? - Get the suitcase. - Hurry up. Yep. Get it. Hmm. I got it. Thank you, Bhau. Oh, one more thing. Tell your men not to follow me. My own rascals are waiting. If they see anyone chasing me, Pannu will really turn Technicolor! See you. Oh no. I'll just take the front door. See you, men of Bhau. Later. Bhau sir. He just left! How will he leave? I have grown too accustomed to winning after making the payment. - Connect me to the Inspector Chewte. - Sir. Yes Sir. Inspector Chewte here. How are you guys? Good. There's a bag under the car. Hide it somewhere. Quick. Search the place. Yes, I smell a dead rat from under the gutter. Searching the house will get you nothing. You'll be a rat in prison! - Find the red bag! - Hey inspector... What red bag? What do you think of yourself? What? That only you have brains? You don't know the c of crime! A policeman butters his toast with it... And has it for breakfast! - Great. - Where is the money? Is it yours? Sorry. Chewte? Did you have a drink so early? Hey, think about it. If I had the cash, would I be standing here? Wouldn't I have gone to Delhi already? Arrest him! - My crime? - Crime? Your crime is that... You looked into my eyes! What the... Why does he ruin my clothes? Come brother. But tell me, where are they taking you? - What politics is this? - It's not politics. Inspector has piles. He wants me to apply some balm to him. Smartass. I'll apply the balm to you. The balm from grinding your own bones! One minute. Do you have a warrant? Asking me for a warrant? Come with me, I'll show you! Why are you asking for trouble? Why do you get so angry? Forgive him. He has lost his mind. He thinks everything is legal. He doesn't know senior officers... like yourself, killed justice and buried it! And now, you just threaten these poor souls with its ghost! Don't be afraid. Hey, Bela. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. What the... Now you'll only return when your hair has turned gray. Hey, Chewte. And if I turn bald like you before that? You little... Come on! Bhau, I have ruined everything! I shouldn't have upset Ram Jaane. Nothing has happened. Inspector Chewte will sort it out. How did he enter the picture? Bhau, have you done something? One challenges those who are more powerful. Not with people like Ram Jaane. Right now, Ram Jaane is in jail, thanks to me. No! You'll get us killed! You'll get us killed! All the papers of the bank scam, all the letters and diaries are with him! If he spills the beans, you'll go to jail in place of him! Oh, God! Hey! Call up Chewte! Yes Sir. Inspector Chewte here! Free Ram Jaane. - But, Sir... - You Pig! Do you know what it means to say 'but' to me? I'll get in trouble? You're right. The diaries and papers are with him. Do something, Bhau. See you. - Get lost. - Oh, no, Chewte. I won't leave in a cab. I have my respect. You heard the phone, right? Get your vehicle and drop me. What if I don't? Have you heard that song? "Ole, ole, ole" Come on now, smooth face. What the...! "This is also a way of living in this world". "You did not find what I stole, I have learnt magic". "Enjoy yourselves, my friends". "Enjoy yourselves, my friends". "Smoke so that your sorrow is eliminated". Hey, Bela! Ram Jaane, what is this? You should knock before entering a girl's room. Why don't girls knock before entering our hearts? They just get in like a jet. Man is finished. See what I got for you. It looks pretty expensive. Don't talk about the cost! Nothing in my life is more precious than you! I'll cut my head and place it at your feet if you want it. I'll give up my life. Finished in one minute. Do you know... since you entered my life... I swear... I marvel at the beauty God has made. Wear this. I swear... you'll look better than the film heroines. I won't wear this dress. You won't? Oh, I get it! Not in front of me. I'll turn away. Wear it. I still won't wear it. I don't want to. Why? You don't like it? No problem. We'll change it. I'll get whatever you want. Ram Jaane, why don't you understand? I won't take anything given by you. - Why not? - Because... Oh, Bela. You're not ready yet? Oh, wow. That's a lovely dress. I said the same thing! But she refuses to wear it. Wear it Bela. Everybody at the party is waiting for you. - What party? - Didn't he tell you? There were three weddings in our area. Ram Jaane paid for all of them. There's a reception tonight. Come down soon. Come. The liquor has just arrived! Tell me one thing... The inspector said, he would cook you in jail forever. And he came back himself to drop you? What politics is this? God knows. Do you know or does God know? God knows. Ok, well, uncle, now tell me what politics this is. God knows. To hell with politics. Tell me one thing. How did you get this name? Hey! Even you don't have a reply to this. "People call me Ram Jaane". "I don't know how I got this name". "I don't know how I got this name". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "O Ram Jaane, tell me"... "How a king of hearts like you"... "Became a slave of money". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Friends, let me enjoy a little". "I have thirsted and starved for years". "That is the truth, crazy one". "Which you thought was an illusion". "Don't tease me, come to your senses". "In the crazy obsession of your youth". "Don't tease me, come to your senses". "In the crazy obsession of your youth". "I don't know how drunk you are". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "One who knows the truth from lies". "He knows how to live in this world". "What do I do, I am different from you". "I consider that as life". "Everyone has to die one day, but"... "O ignorant one, what do you know?" "Everyone has to die one day, but"... "O ignorant one, what do you know?" "What will be the result of your deeds". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "How can I mend your broken heart?" "I feel like breaking everybody's heart". "Don't hate, love yourself". "If you say yes, I'll forget about all this". "This is a matter of fate". "There is a name written on every heart". "This is a matter of fate". "On every heart there is a name written". "Who knows whose name is on whose heart". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "People call me Ram Jaane". "I don't know how I got this name". "I don't know how I got this name". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". Who knows if he will even show up? How long will he make us wait? Look at the time! There sits Bhau and here I sit and yet... Come in Ram Jaane. We were waiting for you. The whole world awaits good times Bhau. Not just you. Isn't that so, Technicolor? Tell us what your demands are. Hey! I haven't come here with any demands. Do I look like a union leader? I've come to do business with you. I want the same cut from your business that Pannu gets. I know all about what your business is and how much is Pannu's cut. Here, read this. Where did you get this? Oh, Bhau. Where ten people work, one of them is bound to be a traitor. Isn't that so, Technicolor? I speak from experience. Kill one of these, another will rise. This treacherous behavior is just like a chicken. Keeps getting deeper. Isn't that so, Technicolor? We accept what you say. But the construction business started after Sameer, so you have no cut in it. All right. I accept what you say, since you accepted what I said. This is how the work proceeds. But all the diaries and papers you took from Pannu's safe, give them to me. Look here. For the car of business to start, you need the battery of trust. Then let the car remain standing. I've found the complete story of your crooked neck. You wrestled before fighting elections. If the opponent was powerful, he played foul and defeated him. You rascal! You are like a chameleon. Can't say when you'll change. I won't give you the papers. Isn't that so, Technicolor? Why do you keep saying, Technicolor? So that you know you're not the only one who can do it. I can too! Understand? Ok, ok, calm down. Speak to Bhau. - Bhau? Where is he? - Look here... We want to do business with you. What difference do papers make? Isn't that so, Technicolor? "What does this world want? Money, money". "What are these relationships for? Money, money". "If you want love, let me have some money". Break everything. - Hey! What do you think you're doing? - Get lost! What is going on? I say, what is going on? The municipal land has to be vacated by morning. Show me the orders. Getting thrashed! Where are they! I'll rip everybody apart! Hey, rascal! Why are you stopping? Hit me. Hit me. You pulled it out with such style. And you yelled so loud, trying to kill me? Look, If you don't stab me now, the public will make fun of you! Look, now I've got my gun out. Now if I don't press the trigger, the public will make fun of me. Come on now. Hurry up. Stab me, so that I can shoot you. Let me tell you, I might escape your assault but if you survive my gun... this whole area will not let you out of their sights. So what do we do? Oh, how about this. We'll get ourselves insulted. You put away your knife and I'll put away my gun. Tell me something. Who sent you here? Who? - Talk! - Pannu Technicolor. You can't interfere Ram Jaane. This concerns land. I am warning you. I won't let anyone step on that land! I told you not to interfere in construction or you'll regret it! Hey, bloody... Look, if it was only me, I would understand, but Bhau... He took ten crores to clear the land. What do we do about that? Yeah? Yeah? Pannu, how did our men return? You said the land would be vacated by morning. Forget about that land. - Who spoke? - Me. Ram Jaane. You'll get your ten crores back. Hey Pannu. What nonsense is this? I want the land not the money! You won't get that land. If I don't get that land, I'll bury you along with the inhabitants! Where are you Pannu? Knock some sense into him! I will. I told you to wait for the morning. Have a little patience. He won't listen. - If Bhau tells him? - There's no way of convincing him. Can't you see? Driving blindly! Is this your father's road? What have you done! You've ruined the construction business by killing him! How will we work like this? Who kills their own guy? Speak softly Pannu. The thing is, loud voices disturb my eardrums. Oh, Pannu, you know, I never kill my own men. Tell me! Don't you know? Who killed him? Malu? You know who killed Baweja. Tell me! - I don't know. - Are you lying to me? - Move. - No. Who killed him? Stop it! - Tell me! - Stop it! Why are you hitting this innocent boy? If he is innocent, who is guilty? You know who is guilty better than me. But you won't catch them. Instead you'll hit innocents. You can't reform these rascals! You've taken over municipal land in their name. You think you're smart? Charge! Attack! Kill them all! Stop it! Stop! Poltu! Poltu! Poltu! - Poltu! - Poltu! No! Chewte! You killed him! You killed him! Not just him, I'll kill each and every one of you out here. I won't move from here till I find Baweja's killer. Understand? Why don't you tell us. Who killed Baweja? Answer! Say it, who killed Baweja! Answer, or I'll kill you! I'll tell you who killed him. Yes, son. You tell me. Poltu. What the... Come. Come closer. It is rare to see tears in the eyes of death. Come, witness death cry. Poltu was only 14 years old. Death doesn't take life at that early age. It takes away dreams. This is not Poltu's corpse but of all future children. Their future has been charted by you! Their lives were full of thorns, but also some flowers. You taught them to remove the thorns by uprooting the trees! Today we lost Poltu. Tomorrow will be Sabir's turn. Then Rocky. Then it will be Chintu's turn! No! No! Hey, hey, Murli. In front of all these people, do you claim that I am responsible for his death? You are wrong! Go on, ask them. Hey, tell him. Tell him. The police killed him, not me. Yes, the police killed him. But why did the police come here? I'll go away from here if you want me to. But I didn't come here myself. You brought me here by force! I don't want to stay here. I am leaving this place. Speaks nonsense! Get lost. Do you know what Ram Jaane said when he was leaving? He wanted me to go with him. I refused. He started insisting like a child. - Why won't you come? - Because I don't love you. Hey, rascal. You are lying. Lying. Lies! Say that you are lying. I know how much you love me. Say that you are lying or I'll set the world aflame! I'll burn up everything! Just say it. Say it. Rascal. Now I know why you say this! Because of Murli! He put this in everybody's mind that Poltu died thanks to me! I am responsible for his death. No! The police killed him. What's my fault? I didn't do anything for myself! If I hadn't killed Baweja, where would all of you go? What would happen to women, children? And his Apnaghar? Where would his kids go? Go on, tell me. Where would your Chintu go? He is right. He is not right. You know I love you, not him. But he loves you. I can't sacrifice my love for him. He has been sacrificing all this time. When he was born, he got trash instead of a mother's lap. When he grew older, he got derision from strangers, not love from family. Life has always kicked him. And today, I, the man he made the mistake of considering a friend... I drew away from him. Bela... You must do what I couldn't. If anyone can reform him it is you. One day you said, you could give up your world for me. Today I say to you... Yes, I love you. For my sake, save Ram Jaane. You look beautiful today. Heck, even I am wearing a shirt for the first time, just for you. This way. This way. Open up. Yes. Here you go. Come. - Good evening sir. - Good evening. Good evening. Today, just the two of us will be eating here. I've booked the hall for the entire evening. It is fantastic. Look at the round ceiling. Where are you? - You didn't ask why? - Because I am here with you. I swear, you know me so well! And that is exactly why ours will be, simply the best pair! Just like ice cream. You're not smiling? City bird! Hey, why do you laugh now? Because I called steward, city bird? Everybody calls him steward, but city bird is my style. Sir... I don't understand your menu. Ask her. Here. And listen. Tell your band, I haven't come from abroad. I am from this country. I'd like to hear some good beats. What kind, sir? What is that? What kind of song? That's the limit! Were you born in Malabar Hill? Haven't you ever seen Ganpati idol being immersed? Haven't broken Govinda's pot? Don't you know what a fiery song is? What do you know? Now watch, I'll show you... "You are my life's first love song". "I don't know what is right or wrong". "You are my life's first love song". "I don't know what is right or wrong". "In thousands, in lanes and markets". "Gardens and springs, in the moon and stars". "There is no one like you". "Just like that among people, among bachelors, among homeless and strangers". "There's no one like me". "In thousands, in lanes and markets". "Gardens and springs, in the moon and stars". "There is no one like you". "Just like that among people, among bachelors, in homeless, strangers". "There's no one like me". "The night is short and the discussion is long". "You are my life's first love song". "I have come in this world for you and will leave this world for you". "Whether you know it or not". "He has made me for you and you for me". "Whether you believe it or not". "I love you". "I have asked my God for you". "You are my life's first love song". "I don't know what is right or wrong". "You are my life's first love song". "I don't know what is right or wrong" 20 for 40. - 20 for 40. - Give it for 25. - Move on. - Please, give it for 25. Selling in black? - Yes. So what? - Are you new? I came here much before you, son. Hey. Don't act like our father! Understand? Understood. Come to jail. - We're coming. First call Chewte. - Acting smart! Is Chewte your father! He will drop us back in the vehicle he takes us! Understand? - Is that so? - Hey, smartass. Don't you know us? We're Ram Jaane's men. Ram Jaane. 'Are these our homes, or the homes of crime?' The municipality had decided to give that land to Baweja. So Murli told Ram Jaane to kill him. Brother Murli, a person gave this package for you. - Hey, stop fussing. - Ram Jaane, you're crossing your limits. Today, I will break all limits! Ok, but you won't see my face after that. Hey, what do you want exactly? I proposed to you but you refused. Do you want to torment me forever? I told you. The day you quit illegal jobs, I'll do what you say. Hey, why do you involve the law with my love? To know which one you love more. Me or your work! This! This! You finish me off here every day at this point! Yes, tell me. Hey, Bela, if I do as you say, will you do as I say? Yes. Hey, why do you say it with such anger? Promise me, with your hand in mine. Hey, why do you see him and draw away? He's not between us. - He's my friend. - But I don't want your friendship. Take back your money. What money? Ram Jaane, I knew you when you didn't know yourself. By giving me money do you want to prove you run Apnaghar? I'll die but not look at this money! What's wrong with this money? They have been printed at the same mint as the others. The fault lies in the way it is earned. How can I teach the kids 'honesty is the best policy' when their school stands on the foundation of dishonesty? Hey rascal! If you wish to die, you can die alone. You're killing the innocent children with hunger! I won't let them starve! And remember. We're in this state thanks to you! Thanks to your friends! I will unmask them all! Hey! You know where that road leads! Your brain will be outside your head! And the kids will be left doing a disco dance! Everybody has to die someday. If my death removes thorns, I'll consider my life worth it. Shut up! Stop it! Rascal, if he sees death's face, all these big words will choke him up! Go home and sleep! Do you think I am joking? It is a joke! Honesty is a joke! Hard work is a joke! The only truth is, those living in buildings suck the blood of the poor! How many will you fight? What do you want? That we do not light lamps for fear of the storm? It's not a lamp! It's a pyre! You are lighting your pyre! Bela, explain this to him. Why don't you understand? If I ask you the same? Do what you want! I've said what I had to! Now I am not responsible for whatever happens! This life is indebted to you. Take it back whenever you want. You'll die! And you will let him die? What can I do? If he puts his hand in a snake's pit, - who can save him? - Are you a snake? I don't know my caste, or else I wouldn't have been caught between Murli and Bhau. But he knows his caste. Why does he envy me? He envies you? Why does he oppose me? Whatever for? He has nothing. He is where he started from! The papers are right. If he hadn't pretended to raise kids, he would still be on the footpath. Flies would be swarming round him! And look at me. People salute me wherever I go. They recognize my face. I have everything. Money, flat, cars... and a beauty like you! He saw you with me and turned green. Wow, Ram Jaane. Wow. You can teach lessons on friendship. The one who sacrificed his own love for you, you are abusing him? Wow. What did you say? Sacrifice? Who sacrificed his love? - Murli? - Yes! - For me? - Yes, for you! - And you? - I can sell my soul for him! Bela... What does he have, that I don't? He doesn't live for himself. Like you, he too was an orphan. But look at him today. To save others, he sacrificed all he had! He thought I might succeed in making you a good man. But I give up. You are still the same! Footpath! Why you little... Get lost! Bitch! You came to me because you wanted a good time! You wanted to sit in a car, show style like rich people! You wanted all this and you take Murli's name! A prostitute takes her money and leaves but you are very smart! You sell your heart before selling your body! But I won't be trapped! I can get hundreds like you! I am not for sale! Hey, rascal! Raise your hand on another! I will rip you apart! Get lost! Why did I hit her? Why? Why did you give me life? Why? Why? Why? I would go to the extent of saying newspapers are responsible for this. Pick any newspaper. You have no headlines but violence and power! We print what is happening in society. - We are the mirror of society. - Absolutely wrong! You only print news that brings forth the horrible face of today. You never print stories to show goodness in society! So, is it a lie that two boys from Apnaghar were involved in Baweja's murder? I am willing to prove the truth with evidence. But I want some answers before that. On what grounds was Baweja given the land of Apnaghar? Despite knowing that Chewte is responsible for Poltu's death, why wasn't legal action taken against him? My last and most important question. Why did Bhau give Ram Jaane a crore? I'll repeat these questions every day. Till the time their echo returns as my answer! Why don't you say something? If we don't shut him up, the public will hit us with shoes! I'll gouge your eyes out if you even look at Murli! Raise your hand and I'll crush it! Murli is my friend! Bring your friend here. I'll open my bank for him. Should I give up my life because he is your friend? Quiet, Pannu. Legislators have started making noise in the Assembly. Some of them have even met Murli. And Murli has assured them that, if required, he'll give proof against us. Evidence? Where did he get evidence? Have you given him the papers and diaries? All the papers are with me. You liar! You will die and kill us too! Let go! Let go! Let go! The matter is spiralling out of control. Look, Ram Jaane, do this. Give the papers and diaries to me. And talk sense into your friend. Explain to him, if he opens his mouth in public, he won't hear even the screams of innocent people amidst explosions. Your friend will survive. - But the public will suffer. - No! I'll get the papers and diaries. But I want no problems after that. I'll talk to that jerk Murli. But warn this fink... No action to be taken. We'll wait here for you. - Bhau... - Quiet! Look there. Captain, reach Apnaghar with your men. As soon as Ram Jaane reaches, blow up the entire area. You've got quite the brains. The game should begin before he reaches. He is crazy. He'll change sides any time. Chewte. Yes. You do not need to understand what I will say now. Go straight to Apnaghar. Ram Jaane is on his way there. Arrest him and take him to jail. Why? There's going to be a blast there. Who did it? Ram Jaane. Why? Because tomorrow morning... Murli is going to go public about Ram Jaane killing Baweja. He'll be in prison and try to break away. You shoot him then. God knows, whether Ram Jaane will be die or not. But Pannu, you turn Technicolor today. This was good. Well done. This rascal deserved it. I knew you were eavesdropping. That's why I played this game. Don't you believe me? Captain is here. You may call and ask him. Here, ask him. Bhau? Are you all right sir? He's dead. Finished. By God! Today he won't escape! The police won't enter the temple! You'll hide thieves in the temple! Give refuge to criminals! Then not just the police, even the army will enter! You're a Muslim. Why are you worried about the temple? So what? Am I not a human? You know religion, but I know I'll give my life to save Ram Jaane! - We'll all give our lives! - Yes! Yes. We'll all give our lives! We'll all give our lives! Don't expect mercy from me. I hate the word, mercy! Counting of dead bodies holds no meaning for me! You're not telling us anything new about yourself. Keep one thing in mind. If you fire one shot today, a battle will be fought. A battle in which I may or may not survive, but you surely won't. If you love these bastards so much, hand Ram Jaane over to me! Whether any of you survive or not, Ram Jaane definitely won't! All right. I'll get him. Ram Jaane. It's all over. Come. Do you know? Before you came in, I thought the same. That it's all over. Come. Come on, get up. Hey, inspector. Why are you drawing your guns? Don't you know, your Pannu has become Technicolor? And Bhau too is finished! - Ram Jaane. - Quiet! You talk too much! Hey! Chewte... There's nobody to save you. Everybody is finished! If you try any smart acts, his death will be on your head. I will rot in prison! - What are you... - Shut up! What are you staring at? Put down your guns! Or I'll shoot him! Throw down the guns! Do as he says. You take so long to understand. Come. Hey, walk slowly. Finished! Sir, this gun is empty. - Murli! - Murli brother... Missed by an inch. Missed by an inch. Hey, he will survive. You too will survive Chewte. Missed by an inch. It nicked him, but if the bullet had touched his heart... I swear... I would have torn your chest apart with my hands and removed your heart! And squeezed it like a rat! Why did you shoot him? Move! Why did you shoot my friend Murli? You are my enemy. Shoot me. Since I was a kid, this chap has been after me! He shook my bones when I was a little kid! Do you know he turned my lips yellow by hitting hard! Do you know why? Only for this uniform! If you didn't have this uniform, you couldn't stand before me. I throw an open challenge to you before the public! If you are a man, take off the uniform and face me! I will prove that your strength lies in your uniform! Inside the uniform, your bones are jelly! Just jelly! Bastard! You don't have the strength to fight me! - That's why you were born in a trash can! - Shut up! - You challenged me? - Yes. - Then take this! - Look at the jelly bones! I have taken off my uniform. If I don't make mince meat of your bones with my iron fists... I am not worthy of my name! Why are you talking with your mouth. Use your hands instead! Get into the arena! I'll prove it before everyone... the size of the bones don't matter. Courage lies in the heart! My hands are twitching. Pick up your fists, tough guy! Throw away the gun! Throw away the gun! You shouldn't have thrown the gun. Finished! - Proceed. - Your honor... I'll prove that the accusations against Ram Jaane are baseless and false. He fired at Chewte for self defense. Hey, why are you lying? Why are you lying to save me? I say it with pride. I killed Bhau. I killed Pannu. And it was me who killed that bastard Chewte! What will you do? Hang me? I don't even want to live in your world! See what you have turned your world into! Third class! This lawyer knows I killed those three. Yet he tries to save me. Why? For money! He sells his soul for money. Sells the law! You have ruined the law by selling justice. You eat food worth thousands in a five star hotel. And buy your wife a car costing 20 lakhs but... But you won't give the five bucks to a poor man! Not look at the footpath. Why? Yes! For money! The whole world runs behind money. So did I. Like you, I too am a bastard! I deserve to die! That's it! You will kill me, won't you? But who will kill you? I am not alone. People like me are being born in the whole world! Because of you! How many will you kill? The law will get tired killing them. But that will not stop them from being born! I warn you! They will be born on every heap of garbage! If you want to kill Ram Jaane, then finish the heaps of garbage first! Or it's all over! Under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, this court... sentences Ram Jaane to death by hanging. Finished! Hey guys! No crying! No crying! What did I say? We live with pride and we'll die with... I've thought of this game. Hang by the noose. And smile despite all the pain. - What? - How? Like Ram Jaane! What's going on? - What are you doing? - Playing the game of death! We are not scared of death! We don't want to live in your world! Buddy! What's wrong with you? Looking at your face anyone would feel you were being hanged and not me. I wish I could take your punishment. No, man. Then neither would this situation come... nor would I ask you for anything. You're late. I could only have given you one thing. My life. But even that has been stamped. The law has taken away your life. In return you have given death to every child of Apnaghar. - I don't understand. - They follow your lifestyle. They are preparing for death not life. If you give up your life with a smile, they will be convinced... Life is a disease, not a gift. And death is its cure. Hey! So, do you want me to cry while dying? - This is my last request pal. - No! I won't fear death! I always lived like death. That is why life never dared... to meet my eyes! I know, my friend. - But, think of those innocents. - I will not! The world will kill them regardless! We are insects not humans in their eyes! Cockroaches! And for that reason you want them to lose their lives just like you? All I want, is for them to live with their heads held high. Look death in the eye! Life is relentless friend. You won't understand! Only when you kick life, you get what you want! If kicking the world gets you everything... then why didn't you get Bela? That's because she has gone mad! She is mad and so are you! I won't listen to you. I lived with pride. And I'll die with pride. That's it! Gently. They said to hang me, not bleed me to death. Now do it gently. I am merely the governments property. Ok then guys. See you later. He used to snore a lot. Constable, look after everyone. Don't cry. I'll tell your mother you'll be following me. Goodbye guys. See you up there. Hey guys! How are you? - Hail Ram Jaane! - I am feeling good. Ram Jaane is the best! Hail Ram Jaane! All my boys! Hail Ram jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! Hail Ram Jaane! - Come on. - Let go. Let me go. I am scared! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You rascal! You... I beg you. Let me go! Let me go! Save me Murli! - I am scared! - Come on! I am about to die! I beg you! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! I will do anything you say. I beg you. Save me Murli! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! Save me Murli! He said he would die with his head held high! You rat! Let go! This too was my style! What? Finished! "Everyone was born in their homes". "I was thrown on the streets". "I don't know if this was my parents' love". "Or some sin". "Or was it Ram's work". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". Sagar, Ballu. Listen, Rocky... "Bela, I hit you, insulted you. Forgive me." I had no other way of sending you back to Murli. If I knew you loved Murli. I swear, I would never have come between both of you. But how couldn't I come? Rascal on the footpath! I came to this world without wanting it. Came between you without wanting it. But now I am leaving. The bread man used to say. What you don't get in this birth, you get in the next. Is there a next birth? Will we meet in the next birth? God knows. "People call me Ram Jaane". "I don't know how I got this name". "I don't know how I got this name". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "O Ram Jaane tell me"... "How did a king of hearts like you"... "Became a slave of money". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane". "Ram Jaane, Ram Jaane".
