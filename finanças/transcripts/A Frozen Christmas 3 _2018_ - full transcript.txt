Hey, Klutz! Hello, Pots. How is it going? It's just another wonderful day here on the North Pole, Pots. Oh, yes! I can't wait to build our first snowman, Klutz. How great is it that all our Christmases are so white? With Santa in tow, we'll be dancing, be merry and take flight. Yeah, we will drop in on a Christmas party, and sing and dance on that snow. With all the other good reindeer you and I know. Imagine Mrs. Claus's hot chocolate simmering on the stove. This is sounding so good. Do you think that if we drink it all, it would be rude? Nah, all our North Pole friends will join us in droves. This holiday will be even better than last year. Hey, let's visit Santa's house for some Yule-time cheer. Hi, Santa. Hi, Santa! Ho, ho. What in the world brings you down here? We were just overcome by the Christmas cheer. And we decided to have the best Christmas party this year. And maybe have some of Mrs. Claus's chocolate hot from the fire. Yeah, hot chocolate, of that I newer tire. Hey, I have got a new carol. Will you two like to hear it? - Would we ever? - Let's hear.
