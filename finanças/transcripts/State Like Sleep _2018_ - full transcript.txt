Subtitles by explosiveskull Let's welcome to the show Belgium's shining star of the screen, Stefan Delvoe. - Alan. - Welcome back. - How are you? - Great. So good to see you. You're looking quite well. Hmm, thank you. Tell us how you got started? I'm lucky because I get to play all these different characters. I become someone new every time or at least live in their skin for a while. We need stories to make sense of the world and that's what movies are. That's why I wanted to make movies. Without stories, the truth is too random. The body of Belgian film star Stefan Delvoe was found earlier this morning by his wife, American photographer Katherine Grant who came in... The young actor's death has been determined a suicide. The couple's rocky marriage and Delvoe's alleged drug use could be connected to his shocking death. Just one week ago after photographs of Delvoe... Striking a photographer in an uncharacteristic rage... Who are you? Get the hell out of here, asshole. What do you want? What are they paying you, huh? Great. That is just great. That's great. That's great. Can you straighten your legs a bit? Uh, bend your elbows. Yep, hold it straight. Can you turn the other way? Uh, like this? Uh... Actually, forget about the legs. - Just, uh, try to relax... - Phone call for you. - ...a little bit. Just a second. - Phone call for you. And just... Yeah, um. They say it's an emergency. Apparently, your mother is in a hospital in Brussels. No, do not put it in my elbow. I can't move my fucking arm. Look, put it there or wherever you can put it down there. But do not put it there. Hey, Mom. Oh, thank God, you're here. This woman is totally incompetent. Sorry. - Oui. - Ow! Merci. Well, you two certainly had a laugh at my expense. She just didn't understand. I'm not stupid, you know. I know. It would be much easier if you were. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, honey, and I love the hair. The short hair. How pretty, thank you. So how was your flight? Mom, why are you here? What happened? Oh, I just had a... ...minuscule stroke. Stroke? I'm totally fine now. Who's your doctor? A very nice Indian man. But why are you "here" here? In Brussels? Why are you having a stroke in Brussels? If you had answered your phone, you would know. Know what? I tried to leave a message, a voicemail Saying what? Anneke is selling the loft, and I came here to pack up your things. Honey, I'm trying to help you. Why would you do that? I don't want those things. She can throw them away. Anneke has been trying to deal with this for almost a year now. Miss Grant. We know this is difficult. Your mother-in-law says that the two of you were in the process of separating. Is it possible that had something to do with it? After photographs of Delvoe and a mystery woman leaked to the press, Delvoe lost his temper and struck the photographer in an uncharacteristic rage. What are they paying you, huh? When was the last time you had contact with him? What? When was the last time you were in contact with him? We hadn't spoken in a few days. Basically, there's a blockage at the base of the brain. If left untreated, this pressure builds and eventually bursts causing severe damage. Medication should bring it down. With treatment and rest, she should be fine. So, we can go home? She's free to go, but I strongly advise against air travel for at least a week. Too much pressure. Can I help you? I'm Edward. Oh. Oh, hey, how'd you get in there? Oh, my... Oh, my God. Holy Jesus, mother of Christ! Sorry, this isn't your room. Yeah, but that's my hand. - Are you okay? - Hmm. I can't... I can't... Maybe I might need mouth-to-mouth. Who was that? No on, go back to sleep. Are you smoking? No. I can smell it. As I was telling your mother, there are a few financial details we need to go over. Just unlock. I never thought I'd see you again. As I was saying, you're on the deed to the apartment. But since you've made no claim, it is now gone to me. We tried to contact you. Many times. Apparently you've been busy. I haven't really done much of anything. We need to fix the roof. There's so much rain here all the time, it's really hard to fix everything. Um, where would I find some garbage bags? They should be under the sink. Right, Katherine, under the sink? Okay. Investigators dropped that off. Why are you keeping all of this? Me? This is your mess. This is gonna cut it, but it's a start so... It's been a year, not even a phone call? What kind of person does that? I'm sorry. - Okay, wait, no... - Sorry? ...let's not get into this. If it weren't for you, this would have never happened. Excuse me, but that is ridiculous. Your son was a drug addict. - Mom. - What could she have done about it? He made his own choices. Is that what you tell yourself? Well, I suppose your way of dealing with it is better? What does that mean? I mean, should we set another place at the table here and wait for him to come back? Will the two of you just stop? They close with the bank in two weeks. By the end of the month, anything left here goes to the dump. My lawyer will be in touch. What a bitch. Honey, please don't smoke. Do you know who he might have been hanging out with? Or where he might have gone? Also, we were unable to locate his mobile phone. Would you know anything about that? We don't have to do this today. I have a pounding headache. Let's just fucking leave. Which one is the caramel? That one? Okay great. Thank you. Mmm, very good. What happened? Good Heavens. She just fell down on the floor. Excuse me. The medication hasn't worked at all, which lead us to the probability of surgical removal. Surgical removal? Possibly, yes. From her brain? Yes. Would that be considered brain surgery? Yes. You should plan to stay for a couple of weeks. In the case she loses consciousness, it's very important to have a family member around... It's a blood clot. He said the medication isn't working and surgery might be a possibility. Ethan! Can I... Ethan, I said no. Hey, sorry... Can you say that again. What did you say? They don't really know. Nobody really knows. Okay. Okay, then, so you were there, so you need to understand what's going on, right? If I could be there, I would, but I can't be there, Kate. Okay, so you're gonna have to deal with this. I am. Are you smoking? No. I can hear you. I'm not. I thought you quit. I did. Hey, Ethan. That's... I warned you this was gonna happen. Fuck, I have to go. Ethan's bleeding from the head. Just let me know what the doctor says when you talk to him. I gotta go. Honey... You look like an iris. Hey, Leon. I was wondering when you'd turn up. You've been gone a while. What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Sorry, I thought you were someone else. It'll make your fingers bleed scratching around like this. Like what? Stefan had a lot of secrets. Let it be. Who are you? I'm a friend. We're all friends here. Hey. I'd like to leave now. Stefan! Stefan, over here! Stefan, here. Right here! Look this way. One more for us. Stefan! Wow. Nice car, man. You have to give this car back. It's ridiculous. Oh, my God. Now you're mad at the car? It's embarrassing. Are you okay to drive? One more, one more! What? You know what? That girl? She's nothing. She's... We were just doing a pump. You should have joined us. Why do you have to do that? Uh, come on. Don't make such a big deal out of it. It's... It's Friday night. It's Friday night. It's Friday... Okay, can I show you something? Someone taught me on set today. I practiced all day long so I could show you. Are you wearing your seat belt? Yeah, why? Oh, my God. It's cool, right? Stunt driver taught me. Oh, my God. Okay. Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no. I get it, I get it. No, no, no, let me try again. - Stefan, stop it. - Whoa! Please, stop it. Stefan! Stop the fucking car. Relax, you can trust me. Fuck, um, fucking piece of shit. Shit. I cannot get this zip up. Can you help? Please. You need to suck in. I am sucking. Thank you. I'm Frieda. Katherine. You know, I thought it was you. "My God, wow. "It's his wife." Fuck. I really loved Stefan. I mean not like you. I never fucked him. I mean, I would love to. Oh, my God. Anyway... It's so nice to meet you. You too. Hmm. Hello. Cheers. I'd like to take a bath. Okay. Can you make the bath? Please. Oh. Yeah, okay. Where is it? Yeah. With bubbles, please. Lots of bubbles. Lots of bubbles. Now, can you get in the bath? All right. I'm in. That's very nice. Could you please make your hair wet? Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. Hmm. I told you I was in a meeting. No, I was. Charlotte... Charlotte, you're acting crazy, you know. You're the one who said you wanted this in the first place. No, no, no, hey! Hey, I never said that. Hello? That's the thing with cell phones you can never tell if someone hung up on you or you just dropped a call. No, the best is when someone hangs up on you, and then blames it on a dropped call. That's a good one. Must happen to you a lot. I'm Edward. You know, usually when someone tells you their name, it's because they want to know your name. Katherine. Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you, Katherine. You too. You do something different with you hair? I like it. Whoa. Stefan. Yo, Stefan here. Leave a message. Thank you. So, I don't know where you are, but the place is a fucking disaster, and you left the door wide open again. You're obviously getting high here so I guess that's that. I'm clearing out my desk today, and the movers are getting the rest next week. I hope you know this is not what I wanted. Shit. Yo, Stefan here. Leave a message. Thank you. Stefan. Can you hear me? Stefan? - Mom, I'll be right there. - Katherine? It's Emile. Look, I'm sorry for my behavior last night. I was, um, insensitive. We have a lot to talk about and I have something for you. So, please, come see me. Who are you? After photos of Delvoe and a mystery woman were leaked to the press, Delvoe lost his temper, striking a photographer in an uncharacteristic rage. The star had just announced his commitment to the role of Cuss in the big budget American action series, Steel Chase. The couple's rocky marriage and Delvoe's alleged drug use... You spent quite a bit of money in Paris last weekend. - That's good. - Uh-huh. Your bill from Aspasbie alone, is more than most people pay in rent. It was. Chicken is good. It won't last forever, you know. You have to be smart. Well... We were celebrating. Hmm? I got the part. Steel Chase. Oh. I knew you could do it. All our hard work is paying off. Huh. I thought you were going to say she's pregnant. What a disaster that would be. No, no, it's just... I mean, can't be a heartthrob with a baby on the way. I mean, it's bad enough you're married. We were celebrating. Because the film shoots in Rhinebeck, New York. We're gonna move there. You're moving? For how long? Um, we decided, we've been here for a couple of years, so we could try being there for a couple of years. We decided, did we? Mom. It's just a plane ride away. You can come visit anytime. And there's a really nice bed and breakfast right in town. A bed and breakfast? Well... Based on the MRI, and the amount of cortisone in the blood, I would like to schedule surgery. Oh. After the surgery, you'll be in an induced coma which will allow the brain to heal without the added stresses of non-essential functions. Would you mind my asking what my non-essential functions are? We take it down to the basics. Breathing, heart rate, blood pressure. Involuntary functions. Yeah, but I just go, like... And you never thought. I can't do it. Take out the middle, like this... You're not going. You're not going. I'm not letting you go. You came back. I'm so happy to see you. No, actually, I'm looking for Emile. You think he's cute? I think he's cute. I'd fuck him for free. I think he's got a girlfriend, though. Take these. Um... Do you work for him? - Who? - Emile. Yeah, for a couple of years. Emile is the best. A bit of a weirdo, but a good person. Hmm? Oh, no, thanks. Come on, it's really good coke. Okay. How well did you know Stefan? Yeah, you know, we talked a bit. Blah, blah, blah. And the last night that he was here, uh, was he with a blond woman? I don't know. Maybe. I don't think so. I mean, he was always with Emile. They were like brothers. You know, every day we make decisions. Big ones, small ones... It all adds up, 'til one day you... You know what I mean? But the last time that Stefan was here, he and Emile had an argument. I don't know what it was about, but right before Stefan left, he kissed Emile on the mouth. Like this. Weird, right? The reason why no one remembers Korea anymore is because it had no look. World War II looked like a fucking Dior runway. Vietnam, fucking brilliant. Sexy, sweaty. Korea? I mean, sorry. I can't think of a single image, which is why no one knows what that fucking war was about. Can you hear it? Lossless WAV file. Like vinyl. Fucking hell. Fucking hell. Cheeky bird. Come here. Do you like New Wave? Stefan loved New Wave I didn't realize you two were such good friends. Come on. You know as well as me Anneke kept him on a tight leash. I was not so good for his image. So many people claimed to be his friends, he never mentioned you. You know, I don't blame you. I never did. Not for leaving him. Not for anything. I know he was here the night he died. And he called you. Why? Why don't you come a little closer. I can hardly hear you. You're gonna make me come to you. Like a little cat. I like cats. Who was the woman in the photo? Did she work for you? Mona. Mona? What is that? Heroin with a little MDMA. Honestly, by the nose, it hardly affects you. I know this song. You smell like the sun. Hmm. Who's Mona? We grew up together, Stefan and I. Did you know that? We spent every summer together. My mother would put me on a ferry from Dover to Calais, and my father would pick me up and we would drive all the way to London. And that was that. June to September. No shoes. No rules. Just us. Running wild at the beach. I didn't know that. And Stefan had a little cat. Named Mona. She was so happy. Like us. Running around, laying in the sun. So free. And when they moved to the city, she got so sad. So she stopped eating. She stopped drinking. Mona is a cat? She would just... She would just sleep all day long. And one day we called her. "Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. "Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty." Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. She didn't come. She died of a broken heart. I think when you die, you leave something of yourself with the people you love. And you see him in me. Why did he call you? He wanted my help. With what? Pulling the trigger. You're not supposed to touch that. What did you say? No one touches my controls. Hey, hey, Frieda. - Controls. - Shut the fucking bird up. No one touches my controls. - You! - Controls. - Chill out, man. We're just having a laugh. - We're just having fun. Get out of my club, you fucking pervert. - Everything's fine. - No, it's not the fucking same. What's that you fucking nutter? Don't tell me. I paid good money. I don't care about your fucking money. Frieda, for fuck's sake, shut the fucking bird up. Hey, get out! You're fucking crazy, man. What's your problem? Why did you do that? Why did he call you? He wanted my help. With what? Pulling the trigger. Hey. You all right? Need a ride? Okay, I'll guess, I'll, uh, leave you to do whatever fine thing it is you're doing now. Wait, wait, I do need a ride. I just need to sit here for a minute. Okay. Oh, whoa. Oh. Don't look. Uh, okay. Oh, God. Take your time, it'll pass. Here. There we go. Good night. Hey. Night, night. - Gimme that leg. - Huh? I want that leg. - Stop it. - I can't. I gotta go. Okay, then, I'll come with you. You're gonna come with me to London? Yeah. All right. And I go to New York? Then I'll follow you there. I'd follow you all over the world. I've got you, and I'm never gonna let you go. Housekeeping. No, thank you. Housekeeping. No, thank you. Coming. Yeah? Hey, what's going on? Did she go in yet? Hello? Uh... - Hello? - I'm here. I'm there. - Okay. - Um... I think... Hey? Can I call you back in a second? Yeah, I guess. Shit! Anneke! Anneke, I need the number for 911. I need a doctor. I need an ambulance. Slow down. Slow down. Tell me, what's going on? I think he's dead. Oh, God, I fucked up. I fucked up. I left him. I left him alone. Stop it. Katherine, stop. Stop! Listen to me, goddammit. Hide the drugs. Hide it all. Hide anything that will hurt him. Do it! Do it now! Okay, okay. Everything went very well. No complications whatsoever. She will remain in ICU on the phenobarbital for the next few days. You know, you've never really told me what happened. There's nothing really to say. I mean, you know what happened. You know, I love you, right? Of course, and I love you, too. I don't need to hear your say it. That's not what this is about. I know you do. I know what happened hurt. But I cannot let you do this to yourself. It's like you swam out to sea, and I'm watching you from the shore, waiting for you to come back. And you are so far away. I can barely see you. And I just want to scream at you and tell you there is good in this world and love, and beautiful things. I did the best I could. And I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you from everything. Everything's gonna be okay. Not so fast. I think you owe me a drink. - So... - Uh, what? Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off. Did you want a drink? Well, I have a drink. You want a drink? - Yes. - Oh, Okay. Right, uh, can I have a drink for my friend, please? - Scotch okay? - Mmm-hmm. You like steak? Here. Have some. Enjoy it. Enjoy your meal. That's what they say here. Have you noticed a lot of Flemish words sound like what they mean? Smakelijk means something that tastes good. But saying it feels like that. You know what I mean? Well, it's not just in Flemish. We have that, too. "Curve" is like that. Hmm? The word "curve". Sounds and feels like what it means. Hmm. All right. Pierce. Slide. Anguish. Rumple. Burden. That's good. I like that one. So what are you doing in town? Other than behaving badly? Funny, peel back a layer and no one's who they seem to be. Now one's ever how they seem to be. For example, you don't seem like the kind of guy who would need to pay a woman to have dinner with him. I'm not paying you. Well, that's the difference. You would. I wouldn't pay you to have dinner. Can I interest you in any dessert or chocolate? Hmm. Dessert and chocolate, no thanks. Charge it to my room, 608. That's my room. Hmm. I don't know why I keep doing that. I must want to be in that room. Room 607. Now you know where to find me. This is for the deed on the house. You need to sign here. And here. And these documents are for you to add Anneke to the joint account. We didn't have a joint account. The week before he died, Stefan transferred almost half a million euro into a new account. You were listed on that account. I am not. If you wish to make a claim on that money, you may do so, but I don't see why you would. It wasn't yours. I thought you handled all of the, uh... Do you or don't you want to make a claim on that account? I have bill and debt to pay. His bills. His debt. It didn't just stop. I need that money. You mind if I take these with me to look over? It's fine. I just need to be at the hospital soon. I'll bring them to you later. Yes. How is she doing? She's fine. She's getting better. Well, then... Okay. Come. Do you know who he might have been hanging out with? Or where he might have gone? Did you notice anything unusual about his behavior in the last few days? Your mother-in-law says that the two of you were in the process of separating. Is it possible that had something to do with this? What the fuck is going on? 1 This is ridiculous, Kate. I even called the hospital. I'm sorry. Can you stop saying sorry? 'Cause you're clearly not sorry. You know that she wouldn't even be there if it weren't for you. If you had just dealt with your shit like a normal person, none of this would have ever happened. I would think that by now you would appreciate the people in your life a little bit more. I do. Then you better start showing it. Okay, did you fax the insurance company? Yeah. Kate? Hello? Are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah, I'm on it, um... It's kind of late here, can I call you back? Kate, hello? Are you there? For a second I thought you were room service, but then I realized I didn't order anything. You want to come in? Have a drink? I hope you don't want ice. They never fill the damn minibar, but, got a bottle from the store. Lesson number one of a seasoned traveler. Do you wanna have sex with me? Is that a theoretical question? Doesn't have to mean anything, it can just be tonight. Who decides that? You're serious, are ya? Why? Don't you do this all the time? I don't do this all the time. Keep staring at me like that, I'm gonna change my mind. No, hey, I'm sorry. It's just a bit... Right now? Right now, okay. Uh... Can I... Are there rules? Can I kiss you or... Uh, yeah, like... Just normal. Okay. Well, this isn't normal, but I'll... I'll do my best. I saw you at that club the other night. Why do you go there? Uh, I travel a lot. It gets lonely. You get bored. You want someone to talk to. But not someone you got to talk to tomorrow. What about you? Uh, my husband used to go there. Oh, is that why you're here? Playing detective? No, it just worked out like that. Faith. What? Faith. Some things are just meant to be. Like me being next door. That's just convenient. There's a difference. I gotta go. I hope I see you around. Yeah, I'll be around. Yeah, yeah, I guess you're not going far enough to justify pants. So, I know what everyone is thinking. So let's just cut to the chase, huh? Steel Chase. What drew you to it? Well, there's... There's excitement in uncertainty, isn't there? Um, it's quite boring to be the same all the time. And I'm lucky, because with every role I get to become someone new. Or at least live in their skin for a while. And Steel Chase is fun because I get to play a criminal. Uh-huh, and we have a little clip of you preparing for the role. It looks quite difficult. Bad guys are always most fun to play. And we can learn a lot from desperate people. Now, you have a 10-year recurring role on the Belgian soap opera Amour Secret. Yes? Tell us a little bit about it. Well, it was the beginning of my career. So, it'll always be special. Like a first love. And I think that's what that role was about. About falling in love like it's the first time every few months. Yeah, it was crazy. I think in real life you only get to fall in love like that once or twice, you... If you're lucky. Wonderful. We'll be right back after this. Nearly a year after the sudden death of the beloved Belgian actor, there are still unanswered questions. Just days after photographs of Delvoe and a mystery woman were anonymously leaked to the press, his body was found, gunshot to the head. But who was this woman? And who leaked these photographs? Who are you? The photographer behind this camera has the answers. Whoever has identified the two is yet another missing piece of the growing puzzle. Am I disturbing you? I was actually in the middle of something. Hey, open this up a little more, huh? I can't fit through here. What is all this? - See this? - Hmm. And this. Nah, I can't see for shit. My wife's been telling me to get glasses for years, but, uh, I'm too vain for that. You're married? Kind of on the skids right now. You don't exactly act married. Do you love her? Of course, I love her. Why do you fuck around? Does she know? No. Uh, the two things have nothing to do with each other. Yeah, right. What? Do you think... Because I sleep with one person, it changes how I feel about another? - Doesn't it? - No. No. I just don't think you can really love someone and maintain a whole secret life on the side. Yeah. Well, have you ever been in love? I mean, really deeply in love? I was married. Not the same thing. How long were you married? Two years. Well... Talk to me when you can last a few more. I mean, two years, come on, you're barely out of the gates there... He died. I'm sorry. What happened? He... He shot himself. Why? I don't know. He was under a lot of strain at work and we were splitting up at the time. I think that pushed him over the edge. So... It was gonna end one way or the other, right? God. It's okay, look. All I'm saying is... There's a reason you gotta find some comfort when you can and love the one you're with. Love the one you're with? Wow, I thought we were really talking there, and you just turned it into a bumper sticker. I was just trying to lighten the mood. What's so bad about that? You're so full of shit. It's just an excuse so you can sleep with whoever you want. Not because you're lonely, because you want to be alone. Interesting theory. In this particular case, it takes one to know one. I'm tired. - Okay. - I was in the middle of something. See, you're doing it right now. I'm not doing anything. I just want to be alone. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll just pretend it never happened. Okay. No, you know what? This is stupid. I'm... I'm gonna try something. I'm gonna be honest. Okay? I like you. And I don't know why, I barely know you, but I want you to like me. And I know I'm not perfect, but from what I can tell you're... ...pretty fucked up, too. So, the least we can do is keep each other company and be nice. So how about I stay? Okay. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Hmm. If you were an animal, what would you be? And don't say bird. Why not? Because everyone always picks a bird. I would want to be a bird. No, see. People... They look up in the sky and they see a bird... Mmm-hmm. Its wings all stretched out and still. It looks like it's just coasting along. Just floating through the air, not a care in the world. Those birds, they're looking down at us and saying, "Shit, I wish I had hands. I'm leaving tomorrow. But I'll be back in a few days. Can I call you up and take you out to dinner when I get back? You don't have to. I know I don't have to, I want to. I like you. I like you, too. Is there a problem? She has a little fluid in her left lung. We should give her some antibiotics. It should clear up in a couple of days. Fuck. Whoa. Yeah? Hi, my husband, Stefan Delvoe, used to work with a trainer here. I'd like to speak with him. What was the name? Uh, I don't know his name. No, no, your husband's name. Stefan Delvoe. The actor? Stof. I had worked with him for about two months for S teel Chase. He showed up everyday. He was very professional. Didn't seem depressed at all. At all. So he seemed okay to you? He was working. He had plans. He didn't seem like someone who was about to, you know. Look. The media, they tell you what you want to hear, huh? They spin the story that works, but the truth, it always come out. What do you mean? It's the details. They don't add up. Just look a little closer. The gun was in the wrong hand. Doesn't add up. Doesn't make sense. See? Hey, miss. His membership expired last month. If he doesn't renew, we need to clear out his locker. People think they can leave their shit here forever, then they get upset when we throw it away, but it's policy. It's in the contract. See? He's holding the gun with his right hand, but the shot went into his left temple. Stefan was left-handed. Yes, I know that, but he's holding the gun with his right hand. It's very common to be ambidextrous with firearms. And the forensics on the hands show... What about the second shot? No one ever explained that. Diazepam, heroin, alcohol, Klonopin, nicotine, Valium, all of these were found in his blood stream. It's shocking he could pick up a gun, much less aim. But Emile was there that morning. You said you think you saw him. Don't you see, he was being followed. He moved all of his money out of Anneke's account a week before he died and put it in a fucking gym locker. Then this photographer vanishes into thin air? The photographer's name is Christoff Makhtan. And Anneke wished to quiet that situation quickly after Stefan's death. And so she paid him a handsome settlement and set him up at Le Figaro under the condition that he would not press charges or speak to the press. Why didn't anybody tell me this? You were gone. Doesn't explain the money. And the woman in the photographs? Or do you know her, too? There are always loose ends. But Stefan Delvoe is... Is important to the national identity. We all have a responsibility to protect his image. What? Miss Grant, we know you're looking for answers. The death of a loved one can be a challenging process, but let me assure you we have ways of knowing certain things. There was absolutely no foul play involved. Yes, in fact, the only foul play involved was you tampering with the evidence. Would you like to talk about that? You're not listening to me. Something happened to him. Too crazy to figure it out. National identity? Bullshit! You call him. It's not my problem. Well, sort it out. No. No, I don't fucking have anymore. Look, please, listen. I have to open the club. Speak to somebody else about that. Jesus. Everybody wants something these days. Why do you have a gun pointed at me? I saw you there that morning. I know you were there. He was here the night before, and you were there that morning. Why? I saw Anneke here with you. Is she involved? And I found the money. He was hiding it. Hiding it from you, or her, or... Was it about the money? Were you blackmailing him? Did you kill him? Okay, clam down. Hey, I'm not fucking around here. I can see that. What are you doing? I have a fucking gun. You don't move. That's how this works. Calm the fuck down. I'm on your side. You should be angry at him, not me. Stefan was a real asshole, you know that? He had everything. A perfect life, perfect career perfect wife. Hey, who throws that away, huh? He didn't think anything of it, I didn't... I didn't wanna sell him that much. He was my best friend. He was very persuasive. So, I just let him have it. And when he kissed me on the mouth which I thought was strange, like he was... ...saying goodbye. And then, he gave me this. He gave me this to give to you. I guess you've already found it. That morning, I couldn't sleep, so I got up and went to your place to check on him and the door was open. The lock sticks. He never locked it. And Anneke, she's no one now, you know that? She doesn't know where that money is and it's driving her mad. That's what happened, Katherine. I'm sorry. This gun wasn't even loaded, you know that, right? The woman in the photos? Who is she? I don't know who she was. Or is. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Hi. I'm sorry I haven't visited until now. It's okay. No, it's not. I heard you went to the police. And of course, you saw Emile. I'm sorry, Anneke, I thought... I don't know what I thought, I... I thought it would make me feel better. I just... I want you to know I never meant for anything to get so out of control. But when you started talking about moving, about leaving me here, I... Stefan was my whole life. What are you saying? I leaked those photos, so you would see them. So you would leave him. I hired Christoff, the photographer to follow him. To find something. How should I've known he would go so crazy. I mean, you broke the poor man's nose. When he found out I was the one behind it, well... He turned on me. He wrote me out of all the accounts. He vowed never to speak to me. Anneke, I think you should go. That woman was his therapist and had been for years. It was nothing between them other than that. What are you talking about? The woman in the photos. It was no affair at all. He loved you. But, that money, I really do need it. Excuse me, there's something going on. Whatever happened, it's done. You want the money, you can have the money. Just get out. Room 403. Hello, my mother. In Room 403. Elaine Grant. Something's going on. Mom, you're okay? I'm here. Mom. I love you. Oh, God. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I should have been there. I should have come. At least she wasn't alone. Yeah. Hmm. So what do we even do? I'm figuring all that out now. Okay. Well, you let me know if you need anything. Yes, of course. Thank you. Thank you for being there. I love you. I love you too. They said I should call someone. I'm glad you did. I'm very sorry for you loss. Have you thought about how you would like to proceed? I want to go outside. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you. Subtitles by explosiveskull
