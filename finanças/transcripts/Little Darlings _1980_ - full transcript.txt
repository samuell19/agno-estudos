I'm the "before" girl in Tidy Tangle's cream rinse commercial. That's her! Move your butt, squirt. Pushy mothers. Well, I knew this one girl, and I swear, she did it on a roller coaster. [laughing] Yeah. Ferris. Where's the weirdest place you ever did it? None of your business. Why not? She probably doesn't know anything. I know enough. Been to fourth base? I'm 15. Nobody goes to fourth base-- I hit a home run at 14. DRIVER: Five more minutes! Well... Looks like some of us are women... and some of us are little girls. Which are you? I think guys are a pain in the ass. Two little virgins. Quaint. No wonder you're always fighting. It's all that unreleased energy. [laughing] You're probably lezes. Maybe she is, but I'm straight.

You can ask anything. What? When did... when did you lose your virginity? I just want to know. Why? Now, why do you want to know that? Curiosity? I know I must have been at least 19. 19? It was nothing. It still is nothing. Then what's everybody making such a big deal about it for? Mm-mm-mm. Hey, Ferris! Looks as if you've made a lot of new friends. Red's a color.

Maybe she'll come back. Your mother is... a very impulsive woman, Ferris. Where did she go? Reno. People get divorced there. Why did you say she was coming back? She said... she wanted time to think. The truth. Are you dating now? I wouldn't exactly call it that. So it's over. Who wants the first piece of cake now? Hey, Ferris, don't you want some cake? Ferris? I'll take it. Don't get fat.

You owe me an explanation. Talk to me, Ferris. I wanted the girls to like me. I wanted to be in just once, I didn't want to be the rich kid. So you made up some stupid story that you and I had been getting it on together. Oh, no. Not exactly. I tried to tell the truth. You didn't try hard enough. Please, Mr. Callahan. Don't "Mr. Callahan" me. We've been intimate now. Right? Sort of. I mean... I wished we could have been. I told them stuff that I wanted to be. It didn't feel like a lie. Sometimes I thought it might really happen... if I was older. I didn't mean to get you into trouble. I suppose you don't think much of me now, huh? Maybe if I was your age, I'd have done the same thing. I love you, Mr. Callahan. ♪ Climbing over Rocky mountains ♪ ♪ Skipping rivulet And fountain ♪ ♪ Passing where The willows quiver ♪ ♪ Passing where The willows quiver ♪ ♪ By the ever-rolling River ♪ ♪ Flowing with The summer rain ♪ ♪ The summer rain ♪ ♪ Braving long And leaping mazes ♪ ♪ Dotted with our Numbered daisies ♪ ♪ Dotted, dotted With our numbered daisies ♪ ♪ Scaling rough And rugged passes ♪ ♪ Climbed the hardy Little lasses ♪ ♪ Till the bright Seashore they gain ♪ ♪ Scaling rough And rugged passes ♪ ♪ Climbed the hardy Little lasses ♪ ♪ Till the bright ♪ ♪ Seashore ♪ ♪ They gain ♪ I want to talk to you. Long time, no see. How's Cinder? How much did you make? I know all about it. Why didn't you tell me it was a game? I would have gone along with it. An easy lay is an easy lay, right? I lost. I didn't tell them. Get it? You--you let yourself lose? Yeah, I'm a loser. No, you're not. Let's give it another shot, huh, Angel? It's too late. We started in the middle. We never even had a beginning. We could try. We won't even have to see each other if you don't want. Just to talk or something. Why not? Because it wouldn't be enough... for either of us. I'll never forget you... ever. So, how are you and Randy doing? Fine. Do you feel different? No. Was it what you thought it would be? No big deal. But now you're a woman. My whole affair was a lie. Come on. He didn't even touch me. You know something? Don't tell anybody. Me and Randy... Gosh! Gosh! Is that all you can say is "gosh"? I mean, for someone who has a large vocabulary... supposedly. We've really been idiots, you know? My mom will disown me. Let's write an anonymous note. We're telling Miss Nichols. We're all in this. If you don't like it, shove it. What good will telling her do? FERRIS: We'll get Gary out of trouble. You're so naive! Nichols won't believe her. She'll just think she's protecting her lover. I kind of think Angel and Ferris are right. Don't be so bourgeois! I am bourgeois. I can't help it. If you two talk, we'll never speak to you again, ever. I don't really care, so shove it. Look, if we stick together, it'll look like Ferris-- Hey, shut your face! Don't talk to me like that. I'll talk to you any way I want. Got it? You think you're so tough 'cause you're a model? Well, I'd rather be fat and feel good inside. Who cares what you think? I do. She happens to be my friend, which is a lot more than I can say for you. Ferris... I'm kind of glad you and Gary didn't fool around. Kissing is more romantic. What do you know? Nothing. Oh. A third virgin. How quaint. Hey, Cinder, better make that four. Uh, yeah. Me, too. You're all absolutely cherubic. Don't ever hit my face! Ever! You fraud. Hey, wait for us. Hey, Sunshine, you've got a pretty mean right. You know, you're quite a woman, Miss Whitney. You really are. Wait till I'm 21, Mr. Callahan. Just wait. Hear from your mother? She doesn't want to be married anymore. She's going to open a boutique in Manhattan. She wants to find herself or something. Guess I won't be seeing you again. I can't breathe. Yoo-hoo, Angel! Over here. Hey! How's my girl? You look good. I have to talk to you. Uh-huh. About what? I think you better straighten your act out. What is this crap about sex being nothing? I don't know. I don't understand. What do you mean? You've been hanging around creeps. Angel, that's not a very nice thing to say to your mom. I'm going to keep my eye on you. You're 40, right? 29. Hey, so long. See you next July. Wait a minute, sucker. This is my friend... Ferris Whitney.
