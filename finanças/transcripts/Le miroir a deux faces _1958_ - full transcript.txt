- I'd like to speak with the Superintendent. - About what? I've murdered someone. Go in. I'm listening. My name is Pierre Tardivet. - v.e.t. I'm a calculus teacher at the Chateaubriand School. THE TWO-FACED MIRROR PERSONAL ADS It was 10 years ago. I decided to get married. 30-yr old man with university degree, seeking a girl for marriage, 25-yr old, serious, active, cultured, perfectly healthy, agreeable character, medium height and build. It's 5 lines. 5? I counted 4. 40 characters per line. Count yourself. Spaces also count as characters. Ah really? In that case, get rid of this... on the last line, and put simply: "Appearance doesn't matter." - Appearance... - Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. I always took marriage seriously. My students had their tasks, and I had mine. My ad received a lot of responses, I had to make a choice... I had to develop a method to avoid subtle traps. I knew women, well, I thought I knew them. Could I predict them? No. It's not really my fault. Come in. You have visitors. Thanks. Georges Vauzanges... Georges Vauzanges? Georges Vauzanges... Vauzanges, Marie-Jos?. This was in Etretat. She was 5. A bit too young for me. 6 years old. 8 years old. 11 years old. 15. It's like you watch her growing up. 16 years old. That's all. Nothing after that. Nothing? No. You can't reproach her for wasting her time with photographers. Show him her picture with V?ronique, it's her younger sister. Oh yes. She was photographed without her knowledge. It was a month ago, at a baptism. Excuse me. Very pretty. Marie-Jos? is the other... The one in the back. When can I meet her? You accept? Yes, to meet her but without any obligations on my part. If you could arrange a meeting... It's a bit awkward... Marie-Jos? isn't aware of our initiative. If she finds out that might cause a disaster. A disaster? She's a bit... proud. But I can't marry her without meeting her. Do you like music? Yes, like everyone else, no more, no less. What's the connection? Marie-Jos? works at a record store. You know Furtw?ngler? Wilhelm Furtw?ngler? Yes, by his reputation... And the 5th Symphony? Beethoven's 5th Symphony? Destiny's knocking on the door! You like Beethoven? Beethoven... I pity the people who don't like him. But you do? But of course. They don't know what they're missing. This music is heavenly. You lose yourself in it, you forget about everything... Right... And do you like Wilhelm Furtw?ngler? Why? You don't like him? Sure. I'm buying this. You should see him conducting. He's so inspired. Right. You know he's in Paris right now? Yes. He has a concert on Saturday. I'm planning on going. What a coincidence! I'm going too. Can't get enough of it. I have two tickets. If you wish, I can give you one. My mother was to go with me but she's sick. Thanks, but I got my own. But it's in the first row. You'd be able to see Furtw?ngler's every move even without binoculars. I'm more used to sitting at the gallery. I won't insist. You aren't going there alone? - Whom I'm supposed to go with? - With me. If I'm not too repulsive. Don't be silly. Here, G?rard, the 5th. 2,950 francs. For one Furtw?ngler? Sir, the symphony takes up 6 sides. Yes, of course. Silly me. I wrapped it up for you, sir. Good evening, sir. Here, just in case. Don't lose it. See you on Saturday... maybe. You never know. Marie-Jos? did come to the concert. We had several dates, and I was even invited to her sister's engagement. Mr. G?rard Durieu, please. - It's up front. - Thanks. Mother, please meet Mr. Pierre Tardivet. Finally... I've heard so much about you from my daughter. Dad. Here you are. Dad thinks he knows everybody, but you haven't met Mr. Tardivet. All the same. Here's to you. Excuse me, Madam. Thanks, I've drunk enough for tonight. And you too. It's a happy day for the children but rather sad one for the parents. To Ms. V?ronique's happiness. It's about time for her to marry, we couldn't keep her in. She's the opposite of her sister, she's boisterous, like champagne. Marie-Jos? is like chamomile. Right, my little chamomile? I'm sure Dad meant is as a compliment. But I like chamomile, I can drink it every day unlike champagne... Excuse us. Your parents are very nice. Everybody's very nice. I believe you've already met. Mr. G?rard Durieu. Mr. Tardivet. Yes, I remember Mr. Tardivet. A music lover. Congratulations. I owe you one. Where's our heroine of the evening? V?ronique! I bet you Mr. Tardivet! You won. My fianc?e. Congatulations! How did you guess? You're Marie-Jos?'s admirer. You look the part. You're wonderful, Mr. Tardivet. May I? I have to enjoy it before he starts making me jealous scenes. Let's dance. May I dance with Mr. Tardivet? Yes? I'll lend you G?rard. Don't steal him from me. I got a hostage, a prisoner of war. - I can't dance. - So I'll teach you. You don't dance? I don't feel like dancing. For my sake. No, G?rard. Not tonight. That's it. 1, 2, 3... 1, 2...Keep your balance. You see it's not difficult. - Are you a calculus teacher? - Yes. Count with your feet. 1,2,3,4! 1, 2, 3, 4. What they teach at those schools? 1, 2, 3, 4. Watch me do it! 1, 2... And hup, and hup... Make me a present for my engagement. A nice present. Tell me. If it's within my power... A smile. A real smile. I'm sorry. It's beyond my power. Besides, what's my smile to you? Marie-Jos?! Marie-Jos?! Come back. Don't be ridiculous. Please go after her and bring her back. What's wrong with her? Nothing. I'm an oaf. It's me. Marie-Jos?, talk to me. Leave me, I need to be alone. Go back. I'll join you later. Later? What am I gonna do with all these strangers? I came here for you, just for you. You're unhappy? No, I'm happy. Can't you see? Don't you see my happy face? My happy pretty face, especially in profile. Oh, come on. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot. Don't pay attention to me, it's not interesting. Not interesting? But I'm your friend, remember? What friends are for? Share your sorrow with a friend. It's not a sorrow, really. Just a little disappointment. I thought that G?rard... A girl's silly ideas, an absurd fantasy... Because he and I were smoking and chatting every evening, I thought that maybe... It was just smoke. And then, one evening, my sister came for me, but she left with G?rard. You see, it's a really silly story. Your sister is a fun girl, but the idea of living with her never crossed my mind. She's so pretty. Maybe. But there are two kinds of beauty... the one that catches your eye, that dazzles you, and there's one that you discover gradually because it comes from inside. Don't hide in the dark. I want to tell you something in plain light. Marie-Jos?, the first time I saw you, what did I do? You offered me a ticket. Yes, a place by my side. It's still available because for me, you're a very good person. Yes, I see in you.... You do? I see in you many qualities, that's right. Now we'll forget about everything and we'll go back and smile. Life is beautiful. You see, we're already walking step in step. PARIS-VENICE Attention, the train is leaving. The train is moving off. Bye, you two! Don't forget, he needs to take his medication every morning! Don't worry, mother, she'll treat me well. Bye! Mother, catch! Write to us, and soon! Venice... Your daughter is very lucky to have married my son. Thank you, Pierre for everything. Not at all. You don't know much this trip to Venice means to me. It may sound silly but it's wonderful to be living one's dream! Venice doesn't do much for me, I'm from Belleville. - Dad, can we play? - Yes. Out of sight... Careful with the doors! Mrs. Benoit and I've been living in Venice for 12 years. 12 years? We went there for a week and stayed for 12 years. Love at first sight? No, Madam. We found a good deal there. A hair salon. We do an exclusive perm. You don't refuse an exclusive deal, even in Venice. Even 12 years isn't enough to see everything. One can spend hours in front of a Carpaccio painting. Yes, from a tourist's point of view. For the rest, Venice is a world upside down, where birds are on the ground, and lions, horses, and crocodiles walk on the roofs! It ain't normal that birds walk in a town where everyone else takes a boat! No crosswalks in Venice! Forget it! Who'd go to Venice for crosswalks? A matter of taste. And I miss crosswalks. A matter of habit. And the stink! Pardon me, what a stink! And the bells wouldn't stop ringing! If it isn't the bells, it's mosquitoes Buzz...Ding-dong... That's Venice for you! Why you stay there? Because I'm stubborn. If you want my opinion on Venice... I'm not asking you... Signor! Signor! I'll carry your suitcase! Let me carry your suitcase! No, we won't let you. Who'd give one's suitcase to a stranger? Bravo! You didn't let him have it. What did I tell you? You smell it? Please, stop. It's wonderful. Your wife's so easy-going. It's your boat. Hurry up. Get off at the 3rd stop. Hard to miss. If you ever need anything, you have my address. OK. Keep an eye on your luggage, and on your wife too! Hope you've had a good trip. Yes, a bit long at its last stage. Have a good rest. We've reserved our best room for you. Hurry up, take the lady's suitcases to #4. Go up. I'll take care of the formalities. But there's no hurry. I'd prefer to settle it now. Marie-Jos?! Pierre, look! It's so beautiful. Beauty can wait. We're moving. To another room? No, another hotel. But I love this hotel. It's not about you. When one fixes a price, he got to stick to it. You were at the agency with me. What price did they name? 1,600 lire a day. It's 1,800 lire now. Plus 15% for the service, breakfast, local taxes... The total is 4,200 lire. They imagined the newlyweds only think about love. Well, no! 4,200 lire a day! Venice is nice but let's not abuse it. Thank God, there are other hotels. Let's go, darling. - We'll ask here. - Signore... Not a single room left. We're full. "Full, full", they pretend it's full everywhere. - What a country! - Pierre, I can't take it anymore. What all these people are doing in Venice? I know why we're here. We'll find a solution. A solution? Oh great. On top of that! That's it! Our hairdressers, the Benoits! They'll find something for us. Let's go. One more effort. You wanted memories. That way. Let's go. They think, these people came from far away. They can't just leave. Let's take advantage of them. But we'll arrange it between us, the French. Let there be light! How do you like it? You're here at home, in France. Look at this, everyone goes to Paris... The Sacr? Coeur, Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame! The Moulin Rouge! They ain't got that here but you can always sigh on the Bridge of Sighs! - It's funny. - Even touching. - But we can't take over your room. - Don't worry. We'll sleep with the kids. ? la guerre comme ? la guerre. Pierre, it's impossible! Impossible isn't a French word. No, you can't do that to me! Mr. and Mrs. Benoit offer us their hospitality. I'm a true Parisian: a randy devil with a big heart. You won't feel homesick on your wedding night. The little one's here with you. Admit, it's better than any hotel. No comparison. Let's leave them, Albert. I can take a hint. Don't mind us, make yourselves at home. Oh him! You know what I'm gonna make for tonight? A steak with potatoes. Fried. So you're happy? Happy? We are put up now. We can't stay here. Why? Can't you see? It's terribly ugly. Just for one night? It's our wedding night. Sorry, I forgot. I was so upset. Pierre, look at this. It's the kids' room. We'll find something better tomorrow. - Tomorrow... Our first night with these people behind the curtain? You think it's normal. What else could we do? As long as you're here, the rest is just the d?cor. You like it? I embroidered it myself. Probably took you some time. The time of reflection. How do I look? - I'm a little scared. - Why? I wanted so much this night to be the best memory we've ever had. So I could always recall it with a slight pinch there. Everyone's had their wedding night. It's not that big a deal. You'll be disappointed. We're in Venice. It's good enough. We can't ask for more. Why? We should always ask for more. No, we should know our place, and be happy and grateful for what life's given us. Pierre, how can you think like that and be so resigned? What you're looking for in music? - In music? - Yes, in music. Music makes us strive for more, not to be content to keep in our place. You couldn't have changed so much? It was so amazing how we met, we had the same tastes, the same thoughts... No, it wasn't that amazing. Look, I'm glad you mentioned it, because... I didn't want lies between us. What lies? I didn't hide anything from you. I did. I don't want to pretend, I want you to love me for what I am, and not the one you imagined. Beethoven's Fifth wasn't real. Our meeting at the shop wasn't real. Furtw?ngler wasn't real. - What are you saying? - The truth. I put in a marrige ad, your parents responded, and we arranged this set-up. Stop. I beg you. Stop. I would've preferred to meet you normally but your parents insisted. Well, it is what it is, we can't change anything. It doesn't prevent me from loving you, to the contrary... Because I love you, you hear me, I love you. You hate me? No. I'm glad I've told you this. I didn't do it on the train, I thought, maybe in Venice, with the d?cor... Yes, the d?cor. Now, it's all settled, we'll aspire for the better. Now we really know each other. Yes, now we really do. I was right to confess to her. Since then there was no misunderstanding. Not a cloud between us for 10 years. Marie-Jos? was happy. No more concerts, of course, but she was compensated: a fridge, washing machine, heating, and all that. I was spoiling her. She got along really well with my mother, a wonderful woman. Marie-Jos?! Hang out the linen! You're waiting till it starts raining? I was duly noted, I couldn't complain, I led the life I always wanted. Only one thing was missing to make me completely happy... a little car of my own. I wanted that car so much, I ended up getting it. Unfortunately... But let's not anticipate events. That's the famous carriage. It's a current model. Current? Really? I have a model that tops that. It's good on the road. How much you paid? They give it as a bonus for buying a box of matches. Bye! Rogue! Murderer! He's lucky anyway. He didn't enjoy it for long. You drove too fast. You think you're in America? They don't care. Insurance will pay. - Can't you see, he's wounded? I'll testify against this road killer! Shut up, you weren't here. Make yourself useful. Find a phone and call Auteuil 62-11. Tell them to send an ambulance. - An ambulance? - Auteuil 62-11. He gives orders like we're his servants! I'll make him lose his license! Give me your tie. - Maybe you want my shirt too? - Please, I'm a doctor. Oh my! Two months in a cast. I lost my earnings for that period. And my private lessons? Who'll compensate me for that? And my nice car? And the hotel rooms we reserved for our vacations, the deposits we paid. And my new suit that I only wore 3 times! He's grumpy today. Why didn't you let him go to a hospital? Because I thought he'd be better off here. Better treated and better fed. Drink it. - What's this? - A sedative. You had something in mind. No, I take all the responsibility for the accident. But not the damage, you admit it? It's my fault. I admitted it in my statement. But you can also blame Napoleon who created the Legion of Honor. We were celebrating my former boss getting it, I was a bit tipsy, and I crashed into you, serves me right. Serves you right. What about me? Who's the victim here? You're right. I offer you my apologies. - Off we go, ladies. - Careful with my leg! Don't touch my leg! The cast is fragile. - Hello, doctor. - Hello, Madam. I brought what you asked for: the money and the note. Yes. Doctor, thank you for the lovely roses you sent. If you could see the basket the doctor sent... I thought they came by mistake. Splendid. I'm smashed, and you get the flowers. I only send flowers to my patients if they die. Look, how beautiful they are. Let me put one in a vase. Flowers give me a migraine. I'll demand a cross-examination. It's your right. You can accompany us to the X-ray, Madam. Roses! Who could imagine? Please. Doctor! My dear doctor! That's the nose I told you about. My new husband picked it. It's nice, and I can change my hairdo to go with it. When will you operate? Ariane. - Doctor? - For the lady. - Today? - Impossible. - Tomorrow? - Impossible. - But my dear doctor... - OK, after tomorrow, 9 am. - You're curious? - What are they? The casts of my clients. Before and after. Before and after. - So you do cosmetic... - Surgery, yes. My real specialty isn't smashing cars but fixing faces. It's fascinating. Let's start with the shoulder. You're happy with it? Half-happy. - Your right breast isn't good? - When will you fix it? Next week, after the TV show. I'm your lady-sandwich. You owe me that. This surgery costs a lot. - It's priceless. - A breast like that. Will they see my face on TV? If you wish so. You wanna be noticed? A half of me wants it, the other doesn't... Interesting, huh? Make me as many snaps as possible, front and profile. Bravo, Mr. Tardivet! In a week, you'll be jumping like a goat, and will go home. If it were up to me, I'd have left a long time ago. - Your time here seemed too long? - Endless. I'd rather be at home with my mother. - And your wife? - Of course, with my wife. My kids, radio, well, at home. Could you come to my office for a minute? - For what? I'll show you something interesting. Come in. I hope you're happy now. Everything's settled: the indemnities, your car and suit... with no dispute, out of court. I have to admit it was fair and comprehensive. Thanks. But being a scrupulous man, I'd like to offer you an extra compensation. - On what basis? On a friendly basis. Look. But it's my wife! You're good at faces. But seriously, you were very lucky to have married a charming, intelligent and sensitive woman. And even more than that. But her appearance doesn't match her character. It's unappealing, unworthy of her. But luckily, the structure of her face allows me to make it harmonious. That's for sure. It's a rather ordinary procedure. Look. That's the wife I'm offering you. No. Why not? I don't want it. You mean that woman isn't preferable to this one? I prefer my wife as she is. And you think she's happy? My wife isn't happy? That's news to me. Not happy with me? Maybe you're unhappy with her? With her? It's stupid. She's got all she needs. - You sure? - I know how much it costs me. Exactly. I offer you to please her, at no cost to you. Let me give her the face she has the right to. The right to a face? If you don't like your face, you can change it? We have to correct the nature, if it did a poor job! Correct the nature? If I changed my face, my mother would ask what I did to her son. She'd slap me, and she'd be right! What about family resemblance? I look like my father, why would I refuse that? Imagine me coming home with a snub nose and almond-shaped eyes. It's not about you! Your wife's ill, and you refuse to heal her. - Ill? She never felt better. - Ugliness is an illness. - As grave as any other. - It isn't fatal. Sometimes it is. No, my wife is happy with me, you broke my leg, don't break my family! Who says a pretty wife wouldn't cheat on me? I know pretty women. They're just great. It's useless to continue this discussion. - Are you an honest man? - Sure I am. Don't you think that before refusing this exceptional gift, you might wanna ask her opinion? My wife's opinion? If you want to. - You'll tell her about my offer? - What do I risk? - You'll show her these photos? - All right. - You give me your word? - Who do you take me for? My wife isn't happy with me? You've never been to our house. OK, you have my word. You weren't here when I came for my first nose job? - I've only been here for 2 years. - Right. I assisted the doctor when he... - When he did my... - No, before, when he did your... - Yes, I remember! I was a blonde then. It's 9:30! Hello, my dear friend, sorry, I'm late. That's perfect. We're gonna make a molding to model your nose. You're already charming, and I have no time to waste. I'm perfectly satisfied with you current nose. - Doctor, you're so mean to me! - Relax. That's it. - Close your eyes. - If you'd listen to me... Continue. - Hello. - Hello. Any news? - Mrs. Winter is depressed. - I expected that. Prosecutor Vincent called to schedule his next skin lift. In a week. And Tardivet? - They changed the room? - He left last night. - He had it for one more week. - He told me to thank you. That's all? And his wife? Did he mention his wife? He said she'd refused. Refused? - Monique. See who it is. - I'm doing my homework. We'll take care of it later. Hello, do you remember me? I'm Dr. Bosc's assistant. Yes, please come in. - My husband isn't home. - It's OK, even better. I brought something he forgot at the clinic. - You shouldn't have bothered. - It's OK, I did it on purpose. Take a look. Who's that, Mom? Do your homework. Your husband didn't tell you that my boss'd offered you a new face? - A new face? - He didn't show you the photos? No, he didn't. Why did he say you'd refused? Why did he lie? OK. We won't insist. - It's quite a difference? - Indeed. - If I were like that... - It's up to you. That'd be too much. My boss is offering this surgery as a gift to you. He's wonderful. - He can't transform me like this. - It's the least. - Why would he? - Just like that. He likes his job. He wants everyone to be happy. It's his obsession. He's a saint. Well, a saint to a degree, when he likes a client... You're different. He sympathizes you. He uses those who can afford it to pay for those who can't. Like an alimony. I know how it is, I've been there myself. I didn't believe it either, obviously. Recognize it? That's how I looked before I met him. Full of complexes. I hated the world. And now, nothing can bring me down. So what do I tell him? I can't accept, it's impossible. But it's crazy! You know what you're refusing? It's not up to me. I'm not alone. Not alone?! Well, one is free to choose. You know our number? Mom, who was it? Nobody. Why you hid it from me? It just slipped my mind, it wasn't that important. Why did you lie and said I'd refused? I knew your answer, after 10 years of marriage, I should know... Yes, no need to speak anymore. OK, make a scene, I knew you wouldn't think of that. I know you, you wouldn't agree to be butchered like this. - What if I wanna be pretty? - You? Yes, pretty, it's beyond your imagination? Pretty to go where? We're always together. Don't you wanna have a wife like this? No, I don't wanna cheat on you. - You're so charming. - And you're naive. They don't do surgeries for nothing. Dr. Bosc is looking for a guinea pig for his experiments. When he doesn't have any, he comes here, I don't want my wife to be a guinea pig. Even if he offered a million, I'd have refused! You, it's always you, and I don't count? After all, it's my face. It's at my disposal. Your face belongs to me, partially. It's jointly owned by spouses. Stop joking. Imagine yourself with a different face. All my friends'd laugh at me. - I'd look like an idiot. - Oh please! You're serious about it? Very. And I don't like your attitude. Dr. Bosc is an admirable man, generous, unselfish... A fraud, charlatan, risk-taker! Read this! An unlucky starlet who wanted to change her nose. The result is rotting bones, the face falling to pieces! Choose: lies, bluff and fraud, or reality? So? You're lucky to have a husband like me. Kiss me. I forgive you. You had a narrow escape. We won't talk about it anymore. The incident was closed. Our life took its course. My wife went to Carcassonne to take care of her grandmother. And Marie-Jos? would send us postcards every day. - Mail. - Thanks. - Is she coming back? - Not yet. Why would she bother? I'm doing all her work. - No word about me? - She sends kisses. - All the same. - Don't be unfair. How much one can say in a postcard? She could've written a letter. One more, the last one. - I don't know what to write. - Write whatever. Say that the change of place has transfigured you. It's wicked. Every patient has an old relative in the country who serves as their mailbox. - That'd do for a week. - It seems so long. - Oh no, don't start it again! - What if it's failed? - Failed? - It happens. Yes, in the papers. I'd give... - 10 years of your life to be a week older? I can tell you a secret, will you keep it? The doctor prepared a suprise for you. A surprise? He made you a Fernandel face. - You scared me. - You're so sensitive. - Give me a mirror, please. - No, it's forbidden. How would I look like? Like a Cleopatra who had to shorten her nose. Impatient? They're all the same, have to take a peek. - You don't know what it's like. - I do, wait 5 more minutes. It isn't long. - Now? - Yes. You're happy? You got to be happy... and calm. Let's go. Here. Careful, there are 2 steps. - If I only could? - Keep quiet and relax. That's it. Close your eyes. Take it easy. So? - You trust me? - Yes. - You'll believe what I'll say? - Yes. If tell you it's a complet success, you'll believe me? Promise? I warn you it isn't a pretty sight. So be calm. Open your eyes. It's horrible! In a week, all this swelling and puffiness will be gone. - Is it true? - Yes, it's true. It's wonderful. Now we need to make this face breathe, then we'll take care of it: massage, hairdo... and in 10 days, your husband will come here with apologies. What's the smallest number with 3 digits? No, Mr. Baignols. No, Mr. Baignols. Don't scratch your behind, the solution isn't there. Come on. - Mr. Tardivet, a visitor for you. - A parent? - A lady. - Thanks. So? Madam. That's me. You don't recognize me? You've done it! That's all? You gave in to that charlatan? You won't make me a scene because I'm no longer ugly? Look at me. I am, and I don't recognize you. I'm so happy to have come here. It's been a hard month. Liar! That's your Carcassonne? Yes, that's it. Look, don't be silly. That's what Carcassonne was about. It was worth the trip? - Kiss me. - Don't touch me! - Excuse me. - Pierre! No, later. Tonight. Pierre! Looking for someone? May I help you? - No, thanks. - The exit maybe? - Let me show you. - I know it. - It'd be my pleasure. - No, please. Sleepy time. Good night, pumpkin. - What do we say? - Good night. Good night who? Don't you like your pretty Mom? - Where's your old face? - She left in Carcassonne. Why don't we change Grandma's face too? Good night, dear. Sleep well. Good night, mother. Pierre. What? Try to understand, I didn't do it for fun. - If you knew what I went through... - Carcassonne? - Don't be mean. - Had fun with your doctor? If you can call this forger a "doctor." You face is a fake. - Now I can look in the mirror. - And see a stranger there. - I'm no longer ashamed of myself. - You've lived so far. You never complained. - I resigned myself to it. Then I realized there was a way out. The day you met Dr. Bosc? I thought if I become pretty you'd be pleased. I had doubts too. Then one morning I decided to take a gamble. Heads or tails? I never stopped thinking of you. What I was for you, an object? I wanted to become a woman again. Your woman. If I cheated on you I'd understand... You did worse: you forgot about me. Yes, you did. Look at me. Do I displease you so much? It must be for me. - At this hour? - Yes. Hello? Good evening, doctor. I've been waiting for your call. How's you first day? Your husband must be speechless. The air of Carcassonne did wonders for you. Yes, it did. He's delighted. Thank you, doctor. Yes, I'm very happy. No, no. I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks for calling. Good night, doctor. Pierre. Pierre, it's silly. Pierre! - You aren't eating? - I'm not hungry. Dr. Bosc put you on a diet? Good. It'll save us money. Where's Daddy? - He's sick? - No. He's not sick, he feels sick. - Hello, Daddy. - Hello. You prickle. - Morning, Mom. - Morning, my boy. - Morning, Pierre. - Morning. - Your cup is there. - OK. - You want toasts? - No, I'm not hungry. Mom isn't hungry either. Why you didn't shave, Daddy? You're too curious. Get up. And put on your coat. You'll be late. Let's go. You don't think it's silly? I didn't sleep a wink last night. I slept very well. Liar. You should see yourself. - You're done sulking? - I'm not sulking. Aren't you gonna call Dr. Bosc? Don't mind me. I promised to call him. Without him, I'd still have had a normal wife. "Normal"... You know who you are? A 6-year old, stubborn and difficult. You chose a stupid attitude and you won't budge. What's done is done. I've become pretty, you should partake in it. We'll have to make up some day. Why not now? Let's have a fair discussion. "I'm thinking of you. Grandma is doing better. I went to see the ramparts. There was a lot of tourists, mostly Belgians. I kiss the four of you. See you. Marie-Jos?." Carcassonne. - "Let's have a fair discussion"? - I wrote several cards at a time. Are we gonna get more? Dr. Bosc's service is well organized. What did she do with the money for the trip? Why don't you ask her? - Well... - Well? You gave her money to go to Carcassonne? - It's not the point... - It's exactly the point. If she didn't return the money, where did it go? The surgery cost you nothing. Yes, Dr. Bosc didn't charge me a penny. I paid for the haircut and bought a dress. ...and a coat. You used the travel money. I never spent that much on myself before. There's always a first. While I'm alive, I won't let you ruin my son. I wasn't born yesterday. And I was born yesterday. I decided to be happy. Thanks to Dr. Bosc to have made me what I am. Send him a postcard. Can you do a bit more? It seems so simple. It's childish, Madam. Here. Excuse me for a second. In the meantime, the husbands are working hard to earn money. You send them postcards from Carcassonne, and they pay the bills. And all this to enrich a crooked doctor, a fraud, a charlatan! Nobody tells the truth here, so let me do this! What's wrong with you? Let me go! Bastard, thief, murderer! Let me go! Asshole! What? We'll meet again! Yes? So you aren't going? What do I tell them? You don't lack imagination. I trust you. For V?ronique's birthday... V?ronique's birthday's is the same every year. If you don't want the cocktail party, come for dinner. Thanks, I'm not hungry. The show of your new face isn't much for me. I'm not good at inauguration speeches. It's not nice. - If we were alone... - What if we were? There would've been less misunderstanding. - Without the children? - I know whom I mean. It's lucky my mother opened my eyes. The two of us, a nice couple! Look at the two of us: Night and day! Do I look like this woman's husband? I'm a widower, I lost my wife in a car accident. You lost no one. I just want us to live like before. It's too late, impossible. Go to show off your nice dress. I have to work to pay the bill. - Don't worry about the bill. - What do you mean? - Nothing hurtful. - You're my wife... I can manage on my own. Hurry up, you'll miss your bus. You're silly. I like you. A strange way of saying it. I'll explain it. You sure put dots on the i's, and your hands where they don't belong. Dr. Bosc, 17 Suchet Boulevard. A genius. Thanks. I'll visit him tomorrow. Change of partners! - Would you dance with me? - You already danced twice. No, it's my turn. Allow me. You're crazy! Not at all. I can dance with whomever I like. You don't have the right to make me jealous. She's taking her revenge. On whom? On you, me, all of us. Look how Jacques is ogling her. You're all the same when you see a pretty woman. Complaining? I'm different. I'm naturally pretty. Change of partners! I thought you'd spend the entire evening with my sister. Your sister is pretty, charming, intelligent... Forget it. She's making up for the lost time. When I think... Of what? Never mind. Say it anyway. 10 years ago, you fled from here and I let you go. Everything's worked out. We're dancing together now. Yes, everything's worked out. You know what time it is? - You're already leaving? - Yes, if you wanna share a cab... - No, I'll give her a lift. - I'm gonna get my coat. - Where's V?ronique? - V?ronique... Ah, it's you. Fortunately. If it were G?rard... Are you crazy? Oh G?rard... What you think of Jacques? Jacques? Who just left. You danced together all the time. I hope you won't do anything stupid. It's already done. It'll last while it lasts. I'm into fleeting affairs. And G?rard? G?rard and I, it isn't working. We've nothing to say to each other, 'nothing to do together. Not even make love. G?rard never really loved me. Just a little crush. For me, that marriage meant freedom. - V?ronique! - Yes! I have to admit he's discreet. Always calls before coming. And serious. Here's a boy for you. - Your parents have left. - OK. I'm coming. You don't hate me too much? What do you mean? For not running after you that evening. No, tonight, I have no regrets. So now you're gonna join your husband, and I'm gonna join my wife, if I can call her that. And I thought you're happy. - Maybe I don't deserve to be. - Don't blame yourself. Good night. Think about my suggestion. You sure took your time. What time is it? 2:30 a.m. Really? Yes. Come down, I wanna talk to you. Now? Yes. What did you mean when you said "I'll manage"? I'll get a job. I'm tired of your reproaches for my expenses. You didn't spend that much on clothing before. I neglected myself, wasn't worth the trouble. And now it's worth it? Yes. Hey, quiet please! You aren't in bed yet? She just came back at 2:30 a.m. She pretends to have been at her sister's. I had a great time there. Everyone was so nice to me. We were dancing, drinking, laughing... What's that tone? The tone of a free woman. She decided to go to work, so she can buy herself fur coats. A fur coat? You gave me an idea. A good excuse to neglect your kids. You did everything to distance the kids from me. I barely have the right to kiss them. - She's crazy. Where are you gonna work? I asked G?rard to rehire me. G?rard's shop, it's just great. Good night. We're done here. If you go work for G?rard, I'll tell him what I think of his wife! OK, I'll find something else. How? Through ads in the paper. And she found a job a week later. Who helped her? Suddenly, I noticed that eccentric and noisy person... I recognized her, she was Dr. Bosc's client. Once again, this Dr. Bosc intervened. Pierre, where are the kids? Gone. - Where? - To the country. - With your mother? - Yes. No more kids, no mother-in-law, your dream's come true. She has no right to steal my kids, she already stole my husband. - I entrusted them to her. - Because she asked you to? She used your weakness. No, it was your idea. You said you wanted to settle it between the two of us. Here we are, alone. The perfect couple. Touching, isn't it? One egg or two? I'm not hungry. Your loss. They're freshly laid. Where are the kids? I put them in a safe place until their mother's come back home. I've never left home! You spend your days at that fashion boutique. I'm not stupid. - What do you mean? - Nothing, I get it. It's vile. Vile, I agree. Sure, you don't want any? Eggs are good for your complexion. Lemon juice, maybe? I'll never forgive you. You aren't going with us? No, I'm not dressed. You know, me and parties... - We could have supper... - Yes, the three of us. I'm not in the mood tonight. So? He always has to be a killjoy. Not nice of you. Yes, I'm impossible. Hurry up, you'll be late. Hello? Hello, G?rard. It's Marie-Jos?. I have to see you immediately. It's very serious. Well, very serious for me. No, I'm not at home... What do I do? Tell me. A man who takes a pretty woman for a courtesan is hopeless. You don't fit together anymore. He married a woman... a woman not too spoiled by the nature... Then he wakes up next to a ravishing creature. And he reacts like a cuckolded husband. Funny. Hello, boss. A calvados for me. I was also fooled by appearances 10 years ago. I passed my chance. The caf? of missed joys. Funny, huh? Too bad there isn't more people around. 10 years. At this moment, V?ronique... She isn't a bad girl. I'll leave her the apartment, bank account, car... all she loves me for. - You're going to separate? - Yes, quietly. They're offering me something in Montreal. I've been delaying my answer until now. I've decided. What you think of Montreal? Not too keen on it? - You have cigarettes? - Which brand? Any brand. Gitanes... How about Montreal? - Impossible. - Why? I'm not free. - I only have Gauloises. - It's OK. Thanks. Let's be serious, Marie-Jos?. We're old enough. Let's be blunt: you never loved your husband. You were grateful to him but love is a different thing. You've paid your dues. You owe him nothing. Your kids are 100% Tardivet. What's the reason to stay? Out of pity? Why pity the idiots and ruin our lives because of them? Look at me. The time for regrets is over. It's wonderful what's happening to us tonight. We're intimidated... We're afraid to admit that we love each other. We've loved each other for a long time. What was ruined 10 ago by my fault, can be saved today if you want to. Tell me it isn't hopeless. We're closing. That'll be 400 francs with the phone call. Let's not waste our time. It took me 10 years to get here. Your cigarettes, sir. Excuse me. Good night. - I'll accompany you. - No. - I'll give you a lift. - I leave 300m away, I prefer to walk. As you wish. - Good night. - Good night. Bravo. You can tell Dr. Bosc that he pisses me off. Pierre. Quiet! I've gobbled up all the cherries. We were happy when we're cooking them. The cherries time makes you sing: Happy, happy, happy... You see, it's easy to say. You're hurting yourself, listen to me! Don't touch me! Stop this stupidity. Get grip of yourself. I'm your friend. I've always been nice to you. Get your paws off me! "Friend"? I came with the cherries to make up with my wife, I brought two glasses. All for nothing! My wife's gone, kids are gone, everyone's gone! I'm all alone. My life is a failure. I was always last at the exams. Barely passed. They're all laughing at me over there. I ignored them. I was telling them: "I'm happy at home with my wife." Then Dr. Bosc came... Dr. Bosc, Dr. Bosc! And it's all over! I loved my wife... my little Marie-Jos?phine. You hear me, slut? I loved her. You don't care, huh? I took my wife to Venice. The magnificent Venice! I couldn't care less about Venice or the 5th Symphony! Because I hate Beethoven! I get it. You hate everybody. Now go to sleep. With whom? Dr. Bosc took away my wife. You know what Dr. Bosc gave me in return? He gave me that... a tramp. If you leave the door open, she's out, searching for lovers. You know it's not true! 1, 2, 3... I'm the head of the family, and my wife is the queen of sluts! Come on in! Who hasn't got a ticket? There'll be enough for everybody! Shut up, Pierre! You're vile! Are you done? You're insane! You're open to everyone, except me, Pierre Tardivet, nicknamed "Tardy" by the little brats. But I know what's going on here... while I'm down there like a poor schmuck. Yes, you're a poor schmuck. I like you. Dr. Bosc made you into a whore. I'm the only one who hasn't enjoyed my wife. I want my share! My share! You can yell! Pierre, Pierre! Help! Dirty... Open up, Marie-Jos?! Open up! Open up! I know, I behaved like a brute. I didn't know how to make her forget that scene. I was even thinking of bringing the kids back. We hadn't exchanged 10 words in 10 days. Marie-Jos? didn't reproach me, but that evening, as I was coming home... What's up with you? Where are you going? Pierre, I'm leaving you. That surprises you? I can't believe it. Goodbye, Pierre. No hard feelings. I warn you: if you leave, you'll never see your kids again. Stop your blackmail, show some dignity. Don't make it a bad memory. - You hate me? - No, I pity you. Listen, one doesn't leave like that after 10 years... destroying everything. Marie-Jos?, say something... You'll find a letter on your desk. Let me go, it's for the better. That's it? Go away, you nasty piece of work! To Orly. Marie-Jos?! Marie-Jos?... Yes, sir. Two seats were reserved for that name. To Montreal. When the plane departs? It took off 5 minutes ago. "With the compliments from Dr. Bosc." Dr. Bosc. Attention, please: the Gander airport announces the arrival of Air France Flight 056 from Paris to Montreal. The plane will be at Gate A4. Ladies and gentlemen, Due to the bad weather, the departure for Montreal is delayed. You'll have to stay here. We've reserved rooms for you. Only take the necessary luggage. I'll go get our luggage. -They could've warned us. Follow me. Mrs. Tardivet? A telegram for you. Attention, passengers from the Air France flight to Montreal... the departure of Flight 056 is delayed due to the weather conditions. Please follow the instructions given to you by the hostesses. You OK? Yes. Please follow me. Mrs. Tardivet, this is your room. - And mine? - Mr. Durieu, #11. Down the hall. Thanks. Good night. Good night, G?rard. Departing in 30 minutes. Yes? Departing in 30 minutes. You aren't ready? Hurry up, we'll miss the plane. Come in. What is it? A cable from my father. It's about Pierre. What an idiot! - It's my fault. - How could you foresee it? - I shouldn't have left. - He made you unhappy enough. What do we do? I have to go back to Paris. My kids need me. And I don't need you? - Don't be selfish. - I'm thinking of you. Then let me go. - When did you get the cable? - Last night. - So you knew? - I didn't wanna tell you. We'd have tortured ourselves all night. I didn't wanna spoil it. I had 7 hours of happiness. I stole these 7 hours. But it's unfair. You can't give up everything... Help me, G?rard. Deep inside, you know I'm right. I'm going back with you. No, your presence in Paris will complicate everything. The trial, the press... your name mixed in this story... all the insinuations... the malicious gossip... our love dragged through the mud... Our love is all I have left. I want you to tell me to leave. It's the biggest proof of love you can give me. I beg you. I beg you. Excuse me, but the plane is about to take off. I'm not leaving but Mr. Durieu is. Then hurry up, sir. There's still time. They're waiting. Go. No. Yes, G?rard. Go. Please. My love. Hurry up, sir. I'm coming.
