Bye. A film based on true events And my whole family disappears in a lake of milk and fog And my whole family disappears... And my whole family disappears in a lake of milk and fog And my whole family disappears... Hi. -Did you get my message? -I did. -Would you like some wine? -Why not? Give us some more beers, please. Thanks. We aim to inform the public about mental disorders, or personality disorders. So there'll be reading from patients' experience, a cold buffet, music etc. It's a part of my PhD thesis. -Are you a psychologist? -Yeah. You can count me in. Good to hear that. Thank you. I feel like it's a natural thing to do. So? TWO SHIPS Will you have another drink? Bye. I really have to go. Bye. This is Mr Zatloukal and this is Martin Kyšperský. You'll find the refreshment in your dressing room and now if you excuse me I cannot attend to you here. If you need me I'll be around. Ok. -Pavel. -Martin. Tonight we have doctors and psychos here but you can't tell who is who. Why don't we eat some sandwich? This here is my dinner. -I'd better get ready. -Off you go. You want to show off your own body but he is not here so you start to masturbate. A bathrobe, a blanket over your head, the warmth of a children's room, glints everywhere as if you were inside a disco ball which is your head and an orange jelly is dripping down your body. Do you really need to know who'll stop cheating on you? Are you ready? This is my personal disorder. Once Mr Zatloukal finishes his reading you can go and present it on stage, ok? Ok. Ok. Get ready. ...and you want to stop her, to find your anchor... But you can't. Right. Thank you, Mr Zatloukal. This was a story of Bára who suffers from depression. And before we discuss somatization disorders, let's hear Martin's band play a song called Woodpecker. My colleague has just told me he can never tell who's ill and who isn't and I find that pretty cool. And what bites you is not your conscience It's a sweater, black and hairy like a gorilla baby It's summer, such a hot summer as hot as suffering It's summer, such a hot summer so pretty It's summer, such a hot summer as hot as suffering It's summer, such a hot summer so pretty... -Bye. -See you. Where do you want me to put the glasses? What do you think? -I think he likes you. -Really? So what about the glasses? What took you so long? I was about to take to my heels. Why? Are you venustraphobic? What is that? A panic fear of beautiful women. I don't think that's my issue. But I'm not sure if I want them to see me in this old swim brief. There are various types of phobias. Like hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. What? Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. Is that a joke? I could never say this. In that case you suffer from it. I'm not into blonde guys. At all. You must be suffering from blondemanphobia. -Maybe. -I wouldn't recommend treating it. I've got an hour and a half. Well... More like an hour. I have to tune into my patient. How about a cup of tea in my place? -And where do you live? -In Komárov. It's not too far from here. -It's on the other side of Brno. -Kind of. Will you fancy me even with my knees knocked out? Who says I fancy you already? Well... ...we don't need to... ...get undressed right away, do we? I think the water has boiled already. -I'd better go and make the tea then. -Ok. Ok. Ok. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's wrong? -I've just remembered. -What? I should have sent some email. It doesn't matter. You can send it from home. Move it! Come on, don't stop. You're so sweet. Thanks. Right, here we go. Event: Nikola Mucha, attending: -Martin Kyšperský. -Jesus, that's too obvious. Why? -You haven't contacted him for weeks. -He hasn't contacted me. Fine, but you're playing it cool so why shouldn't you two meet at a gig? -Thank you. -Thanks. Man, can you see her? -Hi. -Hi. -This is Klára. -Martin. What has brought you here? -We were at the gig. -Mucha was really cool. But I guess we'd better go now. -Why don't you have a drink with us? -Sure. Why not? -Yeah? -I think we could. Great. Let me pick a drink. Lovely. It's the best you can do for our planet. That's what phony, Don Quixotesque, cunning vegetarians always say. So you think plants have soul? No, I'm absolutely certain about it. -Can we go now? -It would be a waste. We've been trying to leave for an hour now. So? -This is an amazing place. -It is. I've never been here before. Yarrow is edible. But it only tastes good when it's young. I'm a city boy. I wouldn't be able to tell a dandelion. I'm going to Norway. For a stint. -Will you hop on a plane and visit me? -Me on a plane? Never. Could I get there by car? -A flying car? -A carpet. -A ship? -A flying ship. "Suicide is a disruption of the instinct of self-preservation. To disrupt an integrity of one's body is harder when an activity is required. To swallow pills, to step into a void. Whereas waiting on a train as a passive option is easier to understand considering the instinct, says psychologist." How did you get to write about this? No one else at the faculty had time to do it. Why don't I put some music on? -Come on, tell me. -Well, it's this mirror-like film. As you're watching it it tells you things about yourself. -So is it a psychological drama? -You might say that. -Are you curious? -Yeah. Thank you. -Hi, Martin. -Oh. Hi. -Meet Eliška. We're going to see a film. -Me too. -Are you? -Yeah. Why don't you join us? No problem, right? I'll go buy tickets. Is there anything wrong? Eliška? Eliška! Go, please. -How is Eliška? -She's in Norway. On a skiing trip? She went there to write a thesis about euthanasia, lack of light, immortality. Are you going to visit her? I don't think so. -Why are you staring at me like that? -Just checking out a proper dickhead. -How was your flight? -The turbulences made me want to die. So how did you manage to survive? -Do you really want to know? -I do. I kept picturing your boobs. Thank you. See you on Thursday. Like usual. I want us to make a promise. -That we'll never lie to each other. -Fine. No, I mean it. You must say it out loud. I promise I'll never lie to you. I promise you the same. -Jeez, did you really bring a compote? -In case you wanted a home-made stuff. Anybody can come here. It's a voluntary work. Being a lighthouse keeper. And what do you do as a lightkeeper? -Nothing. -Cool. I enjoy my writing in peace and quiet. And I also gather firewood here. -Ahoy! -Ahoy! -How about seagull's view? -My job. -A light in the lighthouse. -My job. -Paying the bills. -My job. -Emptying a sink strainer. -My job. -Really? -Yeah. Wiping off kids' snots then. That might be nice, right? I am beckoning you, sailor. I am writing a story of a woman who lives on an island and every day she walks out onto a pier and observes the sea and with every ship there comes hope. And the hope feeds her and burns her at the same time because he never comes. And so she's trying to beckon him. She lights fires, she fasts, she just... She does anything to advertise her presence. The more she ties up to her fantasy the more she's torn apart from reality. -It is called Asher's syndrome... -Didn't you feel lonely here? I wasn't alone here. Really? The wind was here with me. And waves too. Why don't you already tell me where we're going? Drive over there and turn to the left. Ok. So? What do you think? This is amazing, isn't it? Look, a table might come here. A big table. A really big one. And... Maybe a sofa here? We might put a bed here. Right? -Amazing, right? -Beautiful. But the most important part... ...is here. Are you ready? Pure beauty, right? We'll be happy together here. Will you help me? Did I wake you up? Sorry. Go back to sleep. -What's wrong? -I'll tell you in the morning, ok? Come back to bed. You're treating me like a baby. I know I am. Come and get some sleep. -Martin, the leading vocal? -One two, one two. Nothing in there. -Have you ever been in a band? -I used to sing in a choir. -Add up some more. -How is the second mic? -Ok? -Keep saying something. I don't know what to say. Ok, I'm good here. Now the whole band together, come on. Why do I always engage myself in things I hate? It's tough to be so darn pretty A pretty girl gets nothing but torture Transported from one place to another... Fine, thanks. I'm done here. Bye. See you in the evening, guys, ok? I know she's not an A-class singer but still... -She's awful. -No, she's not awful. -Sure, she's awesome and q- q- cute. -Fuck off. -It was her idea, right? -What does it matter whose idea it was? -So I'm right. -Fine. But she just wanted to try it. You're really pissing me off. -This is it. -So close to water? Awesome. -Oh shit, no! -Shit yeah! A fun fact. Count the calls of a cuckoo and get the number of years until your wedding. There used to be a holy picture here. But I can't remember the exact spot. And there used to be a pub here too. Some unknown number. I'll answer it, ok? Hello? Yes. Yeah. I see. And where did you get to hear me? Oh, right. Yeah. Normally I don't but... Oh, that. I saw you back then. You were there. Yes, yes. Right. A tour? Well...why not? As I said, I normally don't do this but... Bye. Are you alright? Shouldn't I drive you there after all? Hi. So? Have they found anything? Nothing. That's great. But they want to keep me here because of some more screenings. That's what they do. I wanted to buy you a book but then I thought it would look like you could get stuck here so I got you this Chinese healing cat. I can't stand it here anymore, Martin. Last night was unbearable. Does it really hurt so bad? This morning I thought I would jump out of the window. Are you nuts? It's been two days. -Other people need months, or years. -But I've had this for years. I even went to New York to see this natural healer. And how did it go? -It worked back then. -See? It will work again. I know. But this is no one-time treatment. It requires prescriptions, diets, exercising. I do everything I was told to do back then. I've never quit. Now that the pain is back it means it doesn't work and never will. There is something wrong inside my body. -They'll figure it out and cure it. -No, they won't. They will. -Hi! -Shit, man. Hi. Cool stuff. -Is it all functioning? -Well, some of it is, some isn't. I'm more into the structures. -May I? -Sure. Excuse me. I hear you were in hospital. I've just been released. -This is how much it hurt. -Shit! Turn it off. Shit. Can you turn off a pain? I'll put your name on a guest list. No, you don't have to. Hard to say. I think I'll go home now. I don't know yet. Looking forward to that too. It's nothing serious, they were saying. It's nothing serious, no, there's nothing, they were saying. Unless they were lying. You're just stressed out and tired. Your bodily flow is flawed. It is breaking. It is breaking. The body's aching. Head, heart, bowels. The pain has come into the world like Adam and Eve. Like Adam... ...and Eve. This is no esotericism. This device can provide a diagnosis when there is a problem in your body. Now I will put this scanner on you and while you're being scanned I'll ask you how you feel. You mean right now, or in general? In general. Well... Lately I've been having this recurring stomach ache and I have troubles sleeping. Because of the pains too. This apparatus can find out if there is a deviation in your body. Now I'll turn the scanner on and we'll start with the diagnosis, ok? You kind of look like a fly. -A fly? -Or a welder. That will be all. I'll email you the results. Thank you. Here you go. Is Eliška coming? She didn't feel well so she went to the Chinese. Man, I'd love some noodles, or... -Sushi maki. -I meant a Chinese healer. -Those who read your tongue? -Do you know what they do first? They forbid you to fuck. For half a year. At least. -Bullshit. No way. -Honestly. Trust me. Nikola told me, she went there. You'd better not laugh. She went without sex for a year. A year, guys. A year. But it would be even better if you were well, wouldn't it? That's not what I'm saying. -How can you be so sure? -Martin, we're about to start. I have to go, Eli. Wait, you're going to work? Martin, the crowd is waiting. Eli, I really have to go. El... Come on! I can't talk right now, sorry. I'll be home soon, ok? Bye. Fuck! -I won't sing with you, guys, anymore. -Ok. Is that all you have to say? "Ok?" Are you feeling well today, Eli? Better. Why don't we go on a trip? Ok. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. Pluto is not among them anymore. Why? Does it have no right to the Sun? Was it too hot? Did anyone ask it? I don't know. I heard on the radio they'd crossed it out. I'm hot. I guess I'm Pluto. Let's go swimming. I'm having a cold. Let me be your lifeguard. Come on, lifeguard. I might start drowning. I'm ready to take action at any time in any way. I hate wearing a wet bikini. -This tastes so nice. -Does it? -How about some wine? -Why not? Do you want some too? -Sure. -He won't have any. -Not even a small glass? -No. Not even that. -What is this for? -To ease the contractions. -I'm not pregnant. -Don't be silly. -Cheers. -Cheers. Nice. The boys are here. Come in. -Hi. -Hi. -Hello. -Hi. What happened to you? Enjoy your meal. Bon appetite. -Was it the fritter that made you sick? -You bet it was the fritter. -Fritters, sausages, all the junk food. -And also the songs he plays. Right. Very funny. Come on, give him at least some rice. I feel almost well. Once you feel well it doesn't really matter whether you eat or not, right? Can I have some more? -Sure, we have plenty. -Cool. So tasty. You guys are heartless monsters. A bunch of freaks. Well... I do think psychedelic drugs could help you out. It blows you into pieces, tears you out of your own body, and you see all the hidden directions which you can never actually touch. Then you just pick what you'll need and put the pieces back together. -Or you don't. -Or you do. What if the acupuncture fails? What if it's all in your head? But it's all interconnected. A head affects a body and vice versa. I'm hungry. You must be able to love yourself and act selfless at the same time. -But that's a pretty tough task. -It is. Hey, don't get into any funny stuff. -You're still ill. -I'm well now. You'll be well when I say so. Now. Now what? Now you're well. Mind the stones. They mustn't move. So how are you? Is everything ok? Great, Lada. I literally feel the stones charging me. The stones will help you. But the vital step is up to you. -Up to you two, actually. -Us? Ill kidneys reveal relationship issues. I mean relationships as such. But let's call a spade a spade. Mostly it's about love relationship. But all the doctors said her kidneys are fine. You must learn to listen to each other more. What was that crap about how we should listen to each other? She doesn't know us. -A cool spot to jump under a train from. -What's so cool about it? Death makes pain go away. -But the nice things too. -Who knows? Let's wait and see then. -Come on. -Don't be a sissy. -Come on. -Stop saying such things then! -You don't know what I'm talking about. -No, you don't know that! Are we going to go for a swim? You're so lame. Go fuck yourself, bitch! -What's wrong? -It's Lada! She says she can't help me anymore. She says the problem is in my head. I fucking know what a somatization disorder looks like! I'm in pain, I don't need a psychologist! I am a fucking psychologist! -Go see that Chinese guy. -I'd love to but he left for home. -Where to? -Interestingly enough, to China. Why the fuck are you pissed at me? I'm tired and keep trying to help you. The pain is not in my head, Martin. This is not a somatization disorder. I'm a psychologist. Sure, off you go. Sorry. Sorry. I was thinking I would try these opioid patches. It was an awesome gig tonight. Eliška? Eliška, hey! Hey! Hey, Eliška! Hey, can you hear me? Eliška! Eliška, wake up. Hey! Fuck. Can you hear me? What? What? What the fuck is this? I want it to be over. It will pass. God, let them finally find something wrong. -So? -Nothing. I'm healthy as a horse. No more doctors or healers. From now on we'll live. We'll live a normal life. Does this game lead anywhere? -To heaven perhaps? -Or to hell? Aren't we going round in circles? Come on. Picture the universe. How should I picture it? Like this. Did you bake it yourself? Almost. Blow it out. Picture a light coming out of my hand straight to your body. I am picturing it. I am picturing the light healing me. I'm so happy to have you. That you're helping me. I'm happy too. If I didn't have you I probably wouldn't be here anymore. Put your hand right here. Do you have anyone you can trust now? I'm glad it's me but I meant to ask if there is anyone else. I'm not in my office nowadays but you can talk to my colleague. You too. Bye. I know I'm driving you crazy 'cos I'm such a tough cookie You say all I do is party Our bathtub full of last week's laundry... In a pub I met my brother My home is getting messy I find it kind of scary to say Sorry, sorry... Hey, man. This was Nikola Mucha. Thank you. Sheriff? Good evening. I'd like to dedicate this song to my girl. Green apples, a cold winter fruit left abandoned, uneaten And the garden's so empty Memories are beaten Stubs sticking out of the snowdrifts the Sun is moving around us But it's lost all its strength as well as breath and its arms We are here, we both are still here, hand in hand and palm to palm And like startled does by the side of the road days are passing by And I don't know, don't know don't know what I could really do just to make our worries go away When like startled does by the side of the road days are passing by And I don't know, don't know don't know what I could really do just to make our worries go away Green apples, a cold winter fruit like a fan that is mouldering All our friends are leaving falling down, decaying Even though the bark is so sappy somehow it's slowly drying The tree is sending out its stories of the past and all their dreaming We are here, we both are still here, hand in hand and palm to palm And like startled does by the side of the road days are passing by And I don't know, don't know don't know what I could really do just to make our worries go away When like startled does by the side of the road days are passing by And I don't know, don't know don't know what I could really do just to make our worries go away -Is the clicking coming from the car? -The sound is weird. It must be something on this side. -Pull over at the petrol station. -What the hell is this? Shit. Man, we could have killed ourselves. There's no way we can get there in time for the gig. This asks for a towing service. Are you calling the towing service? -No, I'm calling Eliška. -Fuck me. It's all torn into pieces. The person you are calling is not available at the moment. Please, try again... -Hello? -Is it Mr Martin Kyšperský? -Yes, it's me. -Can we ask you for help? I am calling about a female body found on a railway near Blansko. -Hello? -Wait, wait, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Situations, trifles, her dress. The smell, her face.
