I never imagined that in my family's darkest moment would come a miracle. Perhaps in the heavens, there are greater things at work than what we think we may know. And when it comes, sometimes it can be as soft as a whisper. And so I've learned to never stop listening. It was unlike any other Christmas in Belford Hills. Amid the tinsel strewn over the trees, the carols that fill the air and the excitement of children counting the days till Christmas, there was something else at work. Something magical indeed. What is it? What is it, Annabelle? Oh, my goodness. "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hill," "there's a child at Belford Hills Hospital" "who's in desperate need of adoption." "Please come as soon as possible." "Her name is Emily. She'll be expecting you." "Sincerely, Rose." They found a child for us. In the midst of the festivities at Christmas... Mother Genevieve? The sisters at St. Mary were busy in their own way. Mother Genevieve? But they spent this time looking after the poor, the downtrodden... Sister Mary. Come in, come in. And the uncared for. Mother Genevieve, I know I shouldn't have brought her here, but I didn't know what else to do. I found her living in a boxcar, probably left behind by the orphan train. She said her name is Emily. You did the right thing coming here. Come on. Follow me. Put her in this bed. Poor child. Emily? Emily, can you hear me, dear? She's burning up. Where am I? You're going to be all right now, dear. You're safe. Mother Genevieve, may I speak with you for a moment? Why did you bring her here? You know this is not a shelter for children. Please accept this rosary. It has silver in it, and it will pay for at least one night. Let me take a look at her. She has a high fever. Let's just hope it's not influenza. I want her hydrated and isolated. And this is not to happen again. No more. This is a private hospital. These beds are for people who can pay. Thank you, Doctor. "And it was always said of him" "that he knew how to keep Christmas well." "If any man alive possessed the knowledge," "may that be truly said of us," "and all of us." "And so as Tiny Tim observed,." "God bless us everyone." Can you read it again? It's getting late. But it's Christmas Eve. Yes, darling. And happily now, there'll be many more to come. And not only will I read you more wonderful stories, I'll also sing you Christmas carols, and teach you to dance. Promise? Well, you know, every young girl should know how to dance. Thanks, Papa. Holy Mary, mother of God, be a mother to all my children tonight. Protect them, take care of them, and, Lord, please, help Emily this night. Send your angels to watch over her, to guard and protect her. In your name we pray, Lord. Amen. No need to be alarmed, dear. Would you like hot chocolate or peppermint tea? Now, there are a great many things that I don't know about, but what I do know is that a cup of hot chocolate does wonders for the mind. Go on. Try some. You see? But let's keep this between us. The doctors might not agree with me. Now, for a proper introduction. My name is Rose. I'm Emily. I've never seen you here before. Yes, I... I have been a bit delayed. Now, let's see. What are we going to do with you? Open wide. Go on. If your temperature is 98.5 and below, it means you have a chill, and more hot chocolate should suffice. But if it's between 99 and 100 degrees, then you're running a fever, and ice cream might be more appropriate. Now, anything over 100... Oh, dear. Oh, well. There's no doubt about it. I need to read you a story. A story? I don't see any reason to think otherwise. Now, let me see... I... I have long stories, short stories, adventures, westerns. Oh, what about a fairy tale? Now we must begin where every story begins. "Once upon a time, a long time ago, "in a place called Millbury, "during a time when the rich were very rich, "and the poor very poor. "In fact, so poor "that even the children were sent to work at the mills "for the great robber barons." "In that time, a young child was born" "named Annabelle" "to a family that lived by the sea." "Annabelle's father, William," "captained his own trading vessel," "and Annabelle's mother, Sarah," "made their home a loving and joyful place." "Their happiness was nearly complete" "until suddenly Annabelle contracted scarlet fever." "So her father rushed home from the sea," "for Annabelle was not expected to live." Her fever still hasn't broken. I'm sorry, I've done everything I know to do. There has to be something. You have to help her. Sarah. Continue applying a cool compress, and keep her as comfortable as you can. Thank you for coming so late, Doctor. Doctor, your carriage is ready. I'm sorry, William. Take care of her. William, we can save her. I'll bring her fresh water. If we can just keep her cool. Oh, Sarah. We can break the fever in time. I know we can.

I don't believe in angels. Mmm. No, I... I don't suppose you do. But let's continue anyway. Where were we? Oh, yes. Oh, Annabelle, aren't you pretty. I'll always be with you, Annabelle. William. William, come quickly! Her fever has broken. Well, hello. "Annabelle's father and mother" "believed that just like in the great stories of old," "a wondrous miracle occurred that saved Annabelle's life." Care for a little more hot chocolate? There you are. Oh, we're coming to one of my favorite parts. "Annabelle grew to be a beautiful young girl." "The only cloud in her otherwise perfect childhood" "was her father's long absences away at sea." "During one of these times," "something unusual happened to Annabelle." "When we think of angels," "we often imagine majestic winged beings" "soaring through the heavens." "But not Annabelle's." "He wore a gray suit with a straw hat." "Now, all angels have special gifts," "and Annabelle's was certainly" "the gift of laughter." That bad. How about a smile? A smile always makes things better.

"It's been said that children see angels "when others cannot. "Whether that be the case," "Annabelle knew that day" "that she had seen hers." "She spoke about him to no one," "not even her mother or father," "for she had discovered a hidden secret friend." "She never knew when she would see him again," "but he always had a way of showing up" "right when she needed him most." "Time passed," "and Annabelle's world was filled with magic and wonder." ♪ Least while I woo thee ♪ With soft melody ♪ Everything looks lovely. I wanted to make sure you'll miss us. Father, take me on your ship tomorrow. I'd make a great first mate. Your impenetrable eyes and shrewd countenance appear to make you worthy. But can you helm a ship in a strong gale? Aye-aye, Captain. With Arctic winds blowing cold on your nose? Easy. Hmm. What about ship's weevils crawling in the biscuits? Eww! I'm in need of a special agent to take care of everything that I hold dear here on shore. Your mother, King Henry and Lily Castle. Are you up to the task? I must warn you, it's not to be taken lightly. Well, King Henry is hard to catch sometimes. But I have your word? Yes. Excellent. And for my part, I promise to return as soon as the winds will carry my ship. Besides, I fear my crew will fight over a fair maiden such as you. Annabelle, your father has something for you. Oh, what is it? Close your eyes. There. It's a machine. Oh, it's a music box! It's not just a music box. It's magical. When I'm at sea, whenever you turn this handle, the melody will be carried on the winds over wave upon wave until it reaches my ship, and I will hear it, and know that you're thinking of me. It's not very loud. Love carries over oceans and time. Do you believe me, Annabelle? Yes. Then we are inseparable. Father, wouldn't it be better if you just stayed with us? At least one more day? Unless we set sail before the wind changes, I fear my journey will take twice as long. Annabelle, why don't you go wash up before we eat? Okay. Doesn't get any easier. Not for any of us. "Silently, one by one," "in the infinite meadows of heaven," "blossomed the lovely stars," "the forget-me-nots of the angels." It must be beautiful looking at the stars from your ship. Mmm. Father, look, a shooting star! Heaven once falls a star, a guardian angel is not far. Do you think it was an angel? Yes. Your guardian angel wondering why on earth are you up so late. Come on.

"Her father's journey would take him away for over a year," "and although his letters came frequently,." "Annabelle still missed him dearly." "Months passed." "Summer with all of its festivities quickly approached," "and with it came the annual 4th of July parade." 4th of July souvenirs. Get your souvenirs. Toffees, streamers, toys and more. "Annabelle didn't see much reason to celebrate." "I mean, the happy festivities surrounding Millbury" "only made her miss her father more." "In fact, she became determined" "not to be happy." "Her attitude was glum and in sore need of improvement." "But little did Annabelle know" "her angel was about to return" "to help her with just that." There you are. My, don't you look pretty. Thank you. I smell popcorn. You want some? Oh... No, sir. Oh? You see, I had a penny, but then I spent it. Oh, I see. Here you go. For me? Yeah. Go ahead, try some. Mmm, delicious.

"But as time went by," "instead of her father's return," "an urgent telegram arrived." "When news of great importance comes to a family" "whose loved one is at sea," "with it arrives an element of dread." "Annabelle's father was caught in a severe storm," "and only remnants of his ship" "were found washed ashore." "No one survived." "That day, the magic of youth" "began to slip away from Annabelle." "With each rose cast into the sea" "went memories of her father" "drifting away one by one." "Those first few months were unbearable for Annabelle." "Her heart was heavy with sorrow." Annabelle, you really must eat something. I'm not hungry. I know how hard it is, and how much we both miss your father, but we must try to keep going. I'll tell you what. Why don't we go into town today? Come. Help me clear the table. Then we'll go. There you are. Dr. Lewis. So good to see you. Good morning, Mrs. Kingsley. Please come in. I was on my way into town and I thought I would stop by and check in on you and Annabelle. Annabelle, it's so nice to see you. Annabelle, would it be all right if you went out without me? I'll be there as soon as I can. Hmm? I'm so glad you came by today. I've been anxious to speak with you about Annabelle. She is still barely touching her food. And hardly speaking a word, I'm... I'm at a loss for what to do. Annabelle just needs time to adjust. Without William, we can no longer afford to keep the house. I'm so sorry. Does Annabelle know? How can I tell her? Do you have any other family who can help you? I have a stepsister, but she hasn't returned any of my letters. This is my last attempt... - Look at me. - What a mess. I'm afraid I can't go out like this. Would you be so kind and mail this on your way into town? Of course. I'll send it right away. You must forgive me for burdening you with our troubles. Let me show you out. I'm sure your sister will come through. Yes. Yes, of course. I assume you saw this letter in the post today. Indeed. What are we to do? If we show your stepsister leniency on her rent now, where does it end? On the other hand, if we don't help her and she can't take care of herself and the child, for all we know, she could end up on the street. What would people say? I'm afraid public opinion would turn against us. If you think she needs a bit of assistance, under the circumstances, I imagine that could be tolerated for now. Charity is a breeding ground for beggars. Why the wealthy must be held responsible for the misfortunes of the poor, I'll never understand. The mill is doing well. Surely, this gesture would relieve us of any other obligation to her, and we would be seen favorably in the public eye. Obligations? Why my father had to marry into such a common family I'll never understand. And now I'll forever be responsible for his impudent decision. And as for public opinion, the only opinion that matters is the Brownings. How they managed to achieve such status and wealth above us is beyond me. But, clearly, this is a family matter. There are certain expectations. She shares no blood of mine. She shall not be responsible for my undoing. Still, it is a delicate matter, and must be handled with a bit of finesse. I have the mill to run, my time can't be whittled away in these petty affairs. I'm getting a headache. Wait. We shall give my sister something better than a handout. We will give her the gift of self-reliance. A job. At the mill? Work will help distract her from her sorrows, and allow her to feel part of something larger than herself for once. Father always did spoil her. She won't hold up. The conditions are poor at best. She's always seemed rather delicate. I run a textile mill, not a Turkish bath house. Now, if she can't handle the long hours, surely, that's not our concern. And she'll just go away? Precisely. Hmm. Mother, what's the matter? Annabelle. Come sit next to me. There's something I need to tell you. We're going to have to leave Millbury. No. I was waiting to hear back from your Aunt Katherine to see if she could help us, but... I just received her letter today, and I'm afraid she's unable to. Mother, we can't leave. Please, this is our home. I'm so sorry, Annabelle. There's nothing else we can do. Love carries over oceans and time. Do you believe me, Annabelle? Yes. Then we are inseparable. Annabelle, it's time to go. We need to catch our train. I'll be right down. "From that moment on,". "Annabelle vowed never to be deceived into believing" "there was real hope in this world" "for herself or for anyone else." "So she hid the music box," "and left behind all the tenderness" "and innocence of youth." "Angels, fairy tales and make-believe," "she decided, should not be taken seriously any longer." "For after all," "if Annabelle had an angel," "he spared her not from the perils of life," "so why should she believe?" "As the door to her home closed for the last time,". "Annabelle's heart closed with it." Your rent is due first of the month, no exceptions. Bath, kitchen, stove. You share the bed. She's usually on the night shift, but she's sick, so, you'll have to work it out. What happened to her? Shut in a room full of machinery. Dust and cotton, that's what's happened to her. When you get mill fever, your lungs give out. A widow these days has half a chance of earning some respect by keeping their job. But these two will be orphans soon. Well, now, lights out at 10:00. Best get settled. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. "And so Annabelle's mother" "went to work at the mill each day." You're new here, aren't you? It's been a little over a month. Oh, well, then... I'm Ethel. Sarah. Pardon me for asking, but, um, you don't look like the type that works at a mill. I'm recently a widow. Sorry to hear that. I lost my husband, too, just over a year ago now. He was a good man. An honest man. He took care of us. My husband was a sea captain. His ship was lost. The sea has a way of taking husbands. More than half the women here suffered the same fate as you. Hard to believe we were all once happy brides. Mmm, I remember the day I was married. I wore a white lace gown with silk sleeves. We were so in love. Perfect. What about you? We were married on a beautiful autumn day. Yep. St. Mary's in the center of town. The red leaves were falling, there was frost in the air. After the ceremony, the church bells rang and rang as we went off in the carriage to the country. I can still hear those bells ringing sometimes in my head. Good. You hang onto those memories. It'll get you through this. ♪ The bells of St. Mary's ♪ Ah, hear they are calling ♪ The young loves The true loves ♪ Who come from the sea ♪ And so my beloved ♪ When red leaves are falling ♪ The love bells shall ring out, ring out ♪ For you and me ♪ The bells of St. Mary's ♪ At sweet even chime ♪ Shall call me, beloved ♪ To come to your side ♪ And out in the valley ♪ In sound of the sea ♪ I know you'll be waiting ♪ Yes, waiting ♪ For me ♪ "As the end of their first year approached," "it was clear that Sarah's meager wages" "could never lift them out of their dreadful circumstances." "But of even more concern was Sarah's health." "She was failing quickly." Hi. How are you feeling? I thought somehow I'd be better by now. I got you this. Oh, Mother. I was going to wait, but I thought now would be a good time. Why? Why, Mother? What's the matter? Annabelle, will you believe in a secret I am going to tell you? It will help you through life so you never feel alone. We each have a guardian angel that is with us from the moment we're born until the day we die. Believe, Annabelle, and take heart. You're never alone. Mother, you won't leave me. Annabelle, promise me you'll remember what I have said. Yes. I'm sorry, Annabelle. The question is, what is to be done with her? I certainly can't be burdened with her, her mother was only my half-sister, after all. Come. That's enough. That's Miss Elizabeth Browning. No. You wait here. As your mother, Alice, it is my responsibility to introduce you into good society. The Brownings are the wealthiest family in town. You would do well to become close to young Elizabeth. Miss Elizabeth. Please, allow me to express my condolences on the loss of your younger sister. I can't imagine how difficult the last few months must have been. Well, we are bearing this as best we can, Mrs. Wentworth. Let me introduce you to my... To my young daughter. This is Alice. Pleased to meet you, Miss Browning. And you. Please forgive me, I'm expected home. Oh, of course, my dear. And send my regards to your mother and father. Aunt Katherine... Ugh, don't call me that. We're not really family. Your mother wasn't even my real sister. What did she say about me, anyway? She believed everyone had a kind heart. Your mother was a silly girl with ridiculous notions. I'm sorry if she filled your head with fairy tales and nonsense, but that's not how the real world works. Come. We've wasted enough time here. Mr. Wentworth sends his regrets, ma'am. He's been detained at work. Shall we wait to serve dinner? No. We'll eat without him. And the young girl, ma'am? Will she be dining with you as well? Don't be ridiculous. Very well. Mother. How long must that child stay with us? I've taken it upon myself to make arrangements for Annabelle. Tomorrow, she'll go to the mill where she'll live and work with all the other orphans. She'll be a mill girl? How long is she to stay? Well, if everything goes well, forever.

Why didn't she recognize him? Did she forget who he was? Oh, worse. She stopped believing in him. But you said he was an angel. He must help her. Oh... Without belief, there's not much anyone can do.

Are you gonna be all right now? She's eluded our valiant overseer again. Fool. How many more months will this go on? What should we do? It's cold outside. She'll need shelter. The only place she can go is the church, which will bring her right past the mill. Have your man wait between the river and the mill. She might try to cross the ice. No. The current's too strong, and the ice is only ever an inch thick. Then we've got her trapped. If we don't, the Brownings are in for a pleasant surprise. What do you mean? It's Christmas Eve. They'll be at the church when Annabelle stumbles in from the cold. Wretched girl. I won't have her ruin my reputation. Don't you mean our reputation? What are you waiting for? Go.

It will help you through life, so you never feel alone. We each have a guardian angel that is with us from the moment we're born until the day we die. Believe, Annabelle, and take heart. You're never alone. Promise me you'll remember what I have said. Yes, Mother. Mother, did you hear that? Shh. "But only Elizabeth heard the knock at the door." Mother, there's someone at the door. Elizabeth. Oh, you're frozen. Please wake up. Please. Oh... Is it too late? Oh, Mother, she's so cold. We must get her warm. Look. Mother, look. We should take her home. You ready to go home, Annabelle? Yes. Come on, everybody! Yay! Did the Brownings adopt all the other children as well? Oh, yes, they did. And what about the angel? Did Annabelle ever see him again? Oh, yes, many times. A guardian angel always watches over you, never leaves you, and most importantly, knows your every wish. Rose, do you want to hear my wish? I want a home. By Christmas. That is a wonderful wish, Emily. Rose, do you think I have a guardian angel? You most certainly do. That sounds like a promise. It is a promise. It was a dream. There's no such thing as angels. Excuse me. We're looking for someone who works here by the name of Rose. Well, there's nobody here by that name. Oh, no, she sent us a letter. From here. That might be our stationery, but I can assure you, there's nobody here by the name of Rose. Oh, uh... Well, it must have been a mistake. Thank you for your help. Thank you. What? What is it, Annabelle? Wait. Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you again, but is there by chance a child here named Emily? Yes, she's still here. Well, can we see her? Please? We're inquiring for adoption. Oh, well, you should have said that in the first place. Follow me. Are you Emily? Go away. I was wondering if there was something that you could possibly help me with. You see, I received this letter, and it's a bit strange, actually. And no one here seems to know anything about it. But do you know someone named Rose? Rose? You know Rose? Look, uh, she wrote about you. "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hill," "there is a child at Belford Hills Hospital" "who is in desperate need of adoption." "Please come as soon as possible." "Her name is Emily, she'll be expecting you." "Sincerely, Rose." Have you been expecting us, Emily? Emily, do you want to spend Christmas with us? Really? Yes. Really. They have a wonderful life ahead of them. They certainly do. I must say, you have a knack for this kind of thing. I have a good partner. Thank you, Rose. And so it was that Christmas in Belford Hills, the heart found more than the eye could see. Hope prevailed and help came from the most unexpected places.
