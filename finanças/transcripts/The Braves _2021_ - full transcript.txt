She said, beat it! - Who you talking to? - You. - Not like that. - Show some respect... I'll do what I want. - Stop! - What's your problem? Stop it! That's enough! Stop! What do you want? Enough! I'm gonna fuck you up! Don't touch me! Stop it! What the hell? Me, not touch you? Wanna see if I know the script? We all do. You might know it, but can you act it? Stop it! The audition is over! This stops here. Go home. We're done for today. So we don't get to act? - You stink anyway! - Stop! You're in my theater! - Let's go. - Wait, please! Shut up! Kristin, I want to read again. I've seen enough. Kristin! As if you stood a chance! I didn't even get to read. Stay out! We're rehearsing. - Where's the exit? - Not here. - Take the other stage. - I can't, Kristin's there. Help me get out. You can't leave via the stage, we're doing a run-through. It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? - Please. The king is coming! My Lord, prepare the chicken. The fattened chicken! Again, from the top. You're nervous. No, I'm never nervous. Give it your all. Relax, don't worry. Will you let me concentrate? Where's the king? There's a short blackout now. Follow me, exit stage right. - No, I was joking. - Now, now! - That was sick! - No, it was embarrassing. Who cares! At least she noticed us. Not like that, we overdid it. I know directors like her, they're sick and they want sick actors, I know she loved it. At least we did what we said. We never said we'd do it like that. We said you'd get on stage, interrupt me, and then we'd fight. I don't know what happened, when you blanked, it... I screwed it up. Well, at least she saw us. - She definitely noticed us. - Yeah. Don't worry. She saw you act yesterday and the day before. I'm 27 years old. On my CV I've worked in 12 cafés, I've probably made 102,312 espressos and... Wait. Oh yeah, zilch movies and plays. Hang on. No regrets. Do you think we could've gotten this far before? 3 rounds of auditions in 5 days. We got to the last round! I don't care how far we got, I want the part. You do tons of auditions, I don't. Ads for cheese, you call that auditions? - You made my nose bleed. - So did you. Here. THE BRAVES I want to see you all one more time. Same scene, the monologues. Concentrate. Start when you're ready. I want to see the scene. One century ago... My great-grandmother landed here. Good. Take me to New York. Show me who you are, that's what I want. She was my age, 27 years old. She was my age. - Take us there. - 27 years old. Don't cheat, serve the story. - I didn't finish. - Can I go again? Concentrate. She was already widowed, and had crossed the ocean to reach Mulberry street. Let me see New York through your eyes. She uprooted herself from Naples with a chop of the axe. She uprooted herself with a chop of the axe. - Manhattan was on the far shore. - Enjoy it! Manhattan was on the far shore. My child. My child. My child, you shall be born here in this land of exile. Seriously, girls? An hour late, and you're with her. - Sorry, it ran over. - I'm leaving. It's unprofessional, I need you to cover for 3 hours. What am I supposed to do? Hey, it's ok. How was the audition? Talk to me, tell me. Did you kill it? Give it your all? Ok, then. Go get ready. Chop-chop, I've got my shopping to do. Mom If it doesn't ring, we didn't get it. Stop going on about it! You're driving me crazy. Shit, you were right. Maybe we shouldn't have fought. - I told you. - How embarrassing! When do you think they'll tell us? How would I know? What is there to think about? She has to choose one of us. It's driving me nuts, all the girls were great. I know. Imagine, she chooses the tall girl for the lead. And Jenny as her understudy. I'd be so bummed. Can you check if the cell rang, please? You went outside, maybe we didn't hear it. Relax, it didn't ring. I checked five minutes ago. I'm done with waiting, give me my cell. No, we agreed to wait. We can do this. What are you doing? Gimme the key! Alma! - Alma, it's ringing! - Stop, it's not funny. I'm telling you, it's ringing! Wait, it's stuck in the lining. Shit! - It's you. - It's me! You have one new message. Today, at 6:08 p.m. - I got the part. - Are you kidding me? No, I swear. - You're kidding? - No. That's so awesome! I'm so proud of you. You nailed it. I knew it. - I knew it. - I got the part. - I'm sorry. - Look at me. I'm sorry. I feel so dumb. Don't be silly. It's the tension releasing. I feel stupid. I'm so happy for you, really. It's as if I got the part. It's amazing. Well done. - Girls! - Sorry. I forgot something, sorry. - Go serve the customers outside. - Yup! We were wondering, what's the chocolate cake made from? It's made from cake and chocolate. You won't see her anymore, she's a star now. I'm proud of you, but who'll do my nails? Don't worry. Even if you go to the Oscars, you're doing my nails. We don't rehearse Mondays, I'll come just for your nails. Congratulations! Can you believe it? My daughter is going to be an actress. When she was young, I left her at day camp on Wednesdays. They got her to act, I thought it was just a phase. - Need some rest? - Yeah. - Is your head aching again? - Just a little. Come on, let's celebrate. I'm ok. From now on, you're going to be real busy. If you drink, you won't cope at the theater. - Promise you won't? - Yeah. - Really? - I promise. - I'm so happy for you. - Me too. - So, girls, ready to party? - Let the champagne flow! For once, I'm doing the honors. It's a one-off! - A star is born! - Here are the glasses. We should all be proud. Hey, babe, it's me. Kristin called me after you left. You won't believe this. She chose me to be your understudy. It's crazy... even if I'll never actually act... it's just the understudy, but... Can you believe it? It worked. I'm so happy. Girls, never give up! I told you once, I'll tell you again. - Got it? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes! - Let's work, or we'll finish too late. - Not today. Go celebrate your success. Work can wait. Let's pay a visit to Bastien. Who? The ass who cheated on her? He didn't cheat on her. - It's his wife. - No way. - Let's pay the jerk a visit. - Stop wasting your time. He's a loser. - I'm babysitting Naya tonight. - Again? - Her mom has a night shift. - He has it coming. Don't waste your time, you've got bigger fish to fry. You need to stay focused. - You're up to something. - We agree, Mom. - I don't believe you. - We agree. We agree entirely. Keep your eyes on the prize. Here. I'm sorry this is so last minute, but they need me. - Don't worry. - Everything's in the bag. Be a good girl. Promise? Mommy loves you. See you tomorrow. - I'll leave you with the monster. - Ok. Thanks. Good luck! So Naya, ready for a fun evening with Margot? Come on, then. - It's broken. - Yes, it is. She's here! - No way. - Yes way. - No way. - Oh yes. Touch, it's real. Hey, Naya! It's aunty Alma. You're overdoing it. - We're taking it too far. - He deserves it. Nobody messes with a classy gal like you. He tackled an attacker, that's not done. He scratched a Lamborghini. He won't get away with it. No way! He can't do that. Not to a girl like you. You're right. But put more make-up on. - Come on. - Come on! Let's go strut our stuff! Bastien! Bastien! Go on, louder! Bastien, open the damn window! Take your kid for once! I'm sick of chasing after you. I wanna go out tonight! - I don't know her. - She's calling you! Don't just stare, open the door! Who are you? You have to take her, please! What? Open the door! Wait, I'm coming up. We're coming up! - Excuse us. - Sorry. I'm coming. Don't open the door. Don't open! Shit! They're deranged. I don't know that kid. - Say hi to Daddy. - Hi, Daddy. Great, end of the joke. - It's your turn. - What's going on? - I'm calling the cops. - Take your kid for once. - My kid? - Fathers! - I don't get it. - There's nothing to get. I'm so sorry, he'll explain. - Explain what? - I'm trying to forget you. I can't help it, she looks like you. - When I look at her, I see you. - She's lying. She's lying. She's lying, I swear. - Daddy. - Fuck, this is a nightmare! - She called you "Daddy." - It's a set-up, listen to me. Believe me, Anouche, I love you, only you. Trust me. And if you love me too... trust me, I don't know them. You call yourself a man? You're a wet lettuce! Let's go. Own up! I'll see you in court, asshole! She's lying. - I love you. - You disgust me. Stop it, Anouche. I wanted to slap him, I was so into it. He was so freaked out! Did you see him cry? You said "daddy" perfectly. - She always does it so well. - She's a star! My child, I want you to be born on this soil that saved our family. Here, where my great-grandmother met her husband. - That's it! - On South William Street. Act as if you don't know what happens. They stayed up all night, he promised to love her and to take her to Paris. That's where it all began for us. Good. Give me more passion. I know we can go further. Pick it up again. Cut the tarp. Our family was torn apart, several times. That's the right energy. But I need a better sense of how she's feeling. Through your words, moment by moment. Through your eyes. Did you get that? Are you taking notes? She's reliving her great-grandmother's love story by staying out all night. I want to see New York, love! Excuse me, I'm sorry. Ignore your cell, carry on. Pick up where you left off. That's it. Our family was torn apart, several times. Each time we were torn apart, love brought us back together, it saved us all. Hello, miss Sarnem, it's Mrs. Béjard. We're waiting for you, I tried calling, I hope you're ok. We'll wait until 6:30 p.m. Your costumes are stunning. Why don't we have these? Look! I'm taking them. Let me finish my story about the chick. I was this close to scoring. That's the trouble, he's always this close. But I was in there! About to kiss her. This close. I was about to dive in, just about to kiss her... Like this. And she says... She looks at me and says, - "I have to slam." - You're kidding. Solemn, like Bergman, she says, "I have to slam." We want the end. She was pissed 'cause she saw I was... She did this shamanic move with her hands. "Peru, Ayahuasca," she was all like that. Then she says, "Gimme a letter." Like a chant, "Gimme a letter." I was like, "B?" "B, brawls, bangles. "I'm not from Washington My grandma's called Chantal." - No way did she do that. - She did! - Like that, for real. - Where do you find them? That's the worst! You collect them, so ask yourself why. When's she releasing her mixtape? To Chantal? I'm done, I'm going home. - I'm beat, I'm going. - One last drink. - Are you coming? - Stay. No, neither of us are leaving. I wanna stay up all night, like in tomorrow's scene. I wanna arrive in character and focused. Small theater goes Actors Studio. No, I'm from the French school. "From the French school," pardon me. One more! To Chantal! For Chantal! - What now? - We dance. Yes, let's dance. - The bars are closed, it's home time. - No, let's dance. Who says the bars are closed? No way, you stole a keg? - For the after party. - Up for a ride? - Hell yeah. - No... I can't, it'll knock me out. I want to arrive in character. She stays up all night in NY, we're staying up in Paris. Lucky she's not an executioner! Mary Antoinette. You're the Mary Antoinettes with your classical theater, your Molière! At least we get real costumes, they believe in us. You! Costumes? You call that crepe collar a costume? Big budget that is! - Small-time players. - We're small-time players? You're calling us small-time players? Show them. - Small-time players! - Show us what? Excuse us. I'm hungry. Me too. If we go back to yours, we'll never leave. Hang in there. You're right. - But I'm starving. - Me too! I'm totally starved. This is totally illegal! - They might have something. - Yeah. Good evening. Good evening. Excuse me, we're a bit hungry, do you have any bread or cheese? No, we've packed it all away, sorry. What about some applesauce? - A little morsel? - No. Fruit? A kiwi? We're starved and everything is shut. Didn't you eat enough at the wedding? The food was good. It was delicious, but we arrived late. - You're not wedding guests. - Sure we are. We just want some bread or turkey... There's zero food left, we've packed it all away. - A piece of bread, a drop of ketchup? - No, they ate it all. - Cheese. - They ate it all. - How about the fridge? - The fridges are shut, the oven's off. - Are there locks on the fridges? - Yes. - For real? - Arthur, tell them please. Arthur, how about cheese melts? Arthur, is there anything left? - Arthur. - Arthur, please. - He's lying. - There's nothing! Stop being so stingy! If I had something, I'd give it to you! You shouldn't even be here, you've dirtied the floor. Come on, just two melts. What "two melts?" This isn't a fast-food joint. How did you even get in here? Turn the oven on. Enough, go away. - Are you nuts? - Beat it! Come on, time to leave. Please, you're taking advantage. - The bar? - You can't go to the wedding. - Yes we can. - No you can't, they'll kill me. Up for an all-nighter? You're on! You want a drink? A drink, please. Thank you all for being here tonight. It was a stunning wedding, really moving. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Are you ok? - I'm great! Hey there. Want a drink? You're wearing my sweater? I wanted to get in, too. Two drinks. I'm so happy you're all here, thank you! - Is it a cashmere sweater? - Yes. It's really soft. It's nice and intimate, I love it. You should come dance, and hug me tight to feel the softness. Feel how soft it is. It's so cool you all came... - Shall we dance? - No. One more. Your sweater's so soft. It's cashmere. Can't you smell that? Can't you smell... how I'm gonna kill it on stage tomorrow? Excuse me, I'm borrowing her. Sure you don't wanna dance? - Come on then. - Really? No, just kidding. Tonight, I've got a little slam for you. Brawls, billiards, bangles I'm not from Washington My grandma's called Chantal I told you we should go sleep it off. Hurry up. The all-nighter was a bad idea. No you don't. Come on, wake up! You have to give the trumpet back. Come on, get changed. Kristin's gonna kill us. Ok, ok! Here we go. We can sleep later. All night, I walked the streets of NY, in my family's footsteps. My mom never saw New York. She was born in La Chapelle, in Paris, like me. - Let's hear your monologue! - Sorry, I blanked. You're not in New York anymore. I'm sorry, let's do it. Start again. Improvise. All night, I walked the streets of NY, in my family's footsteps. My mom never saw New York. She was born in La Chapelle, in Paris... You're not in NY anymore. What's going on? You have to give it more energy, a lot more. Give me more energy. Can we take a break? - We just started. - It's been two hours. I don't feel well. Pick up the monologue. Alma. Can we take a break? - Start from the top. - The top? Stop being so dramatic, please. - I'm not well. - Hopeless. You're both hopeless today. - What did I do? - Wake up. - Are you taking notes? - Yes. Show me. You haven't written anything. Alma! - Call an ambulance! - Did you take something? - Are you ok? - Yes, Kristin. You need to rest. Rehearsals are very demanding. I've got everything, we can go. What are you doing? - She can't go alone. - The understudy stays. I need to try things out. Kristin, it's ok. - I can do it. - Really. - Kristin, please. - I mean it, get some rest. Get some rest. I just need some sleep. Take notes so I can catch up tonight. - Are you sure? - Yes, I just need some sleep. - I'll pick you up after. - No, my mom will. You stay and work, ok? My mom will get me. Get some rest, Alma. Back to work? Get back into the scene. Take your time. Concentrate. My mom never saw New York. - She was born in La Chapelle... - Again. What does she feel? My mom never saw New York. She was born in La Chapelle, in Paris, like me. Again. What does she feel in her gut? I searched for what I was missing, unaware that it was waiting on the opposite shore. Across the ocean I found myself... That's it, yes! ... without losing anything on the way, not a drop of life. Hi, I'm here to visit a friend in the ER. She may have left already, I can't reach her. - Her name, please? - Alma Sarnem. She's on the fourth floor. Excuse me, sorry. - Hello. - I'm looking for Alma Sarnem. - Alma, she's... - She's meant to be in the ER. She's outside with the others, take the staircase over there. Alma. Alma. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Who told you I was here? Who told you I was here? Who? I looked all over the ER for you... I tried to contact you, I called you. But why did you come? I told you my mom was coming. - What's going on? - Why are you here? - What's going on? - Stop. - What's going on? - Stop, Margot. - What do you mean "stop?" - Stop. I said stop. Let's go. Stop it! No, come on, get up. Show me what I missed this morning, I didn't take any notes. Sorry. Don't cry or I'll cry, too. Sorry, I'm confused. I'm sorry, forgive me. Swear you'll keep this to yourself? Yes. I have to hold out. Say something. If you don't, I swear... we'll never see each other again. Say something. - Say something. - I am saying something. I'm getting treatment, ok? I'm getting treatment, I'll be fine. - Now show me what you did. - Alright. - Everything you did this morning. - Alright. You're white as a ghost. They'll have to give you some sugar. Come on, let's go. Alma, I was just in your room. Why didn't you come yesterday? We were waiting for you. I'm sorry. I got your message. I'll come and explain. The anesthetist is on a schedule, you can't just not show up. I know you've got the theater. We agreed because it's good for you. But on condition that you attend your appointments. You mustn't exhaust yourself. The rehearsal overran... Ok, I'll see you in my office. I'm glad you came with a friend. It's important. I'm glad. I'll get dressed and come see you. Better with, right? It's well made, isn't it? I look awful. I've got a date with the guy from the wedding. Lucky I slept all afternoon. How do I look? Rested? That's it... Was it hard, this afternoon? No, it was ok. I'll show you everything. Wait for me here, I won't be long. I'll be right back. Don't touch my hair! I can't stand that. Get lost, dickhead! - What's going on? - Get lost! I'm done with you. You're not my type anyway, it would never work. - That's it? - Yeah. Get lost! See ya. Wait, where are you going? Come back! - I do like you. - Serious? You deserve better. It's my fault, it's never happened before. I didn't put it on properly. Can I order some French fries? What now? What? We're not dying today. We're not dying today. Show me what you did today? I wanna go to New York. We certainly bounce back quickly. We bounce back quickly. When she arrived here, my great-grandmother took the children to Coney Island. Less melancholic! It's their first distraction since their exile. I don't understand, I can't do it. You don't have to understand, you have to take me there. Alma, I know. Think about when we crash a party. We go incognito, afraid we'll get caught, but when we get there, we go wild. Get it now? That's the spirit of this scene. Like this. Happy! Felicità! I am happy. - Happy. - Got it? - We'll do an exercise. - Why are you laughing? - I'm not. I got it. - Stand face to face. Close your eyes. When I clap my hands, say, "Happy birthday." Let it all out! Even more! Let it out! Now your lines! My great-grandmother took the children to Coney Island. Give it more! They spent one crazy night there. They were leaving nothing else to chance. The boat had uprooted them, then rooted them here. They knew that all was yet to build for the future generations. That's right. From the top. You got it! You were great. I'm so scared it'll move again. - Is it ok now? - Yeah. I can't lose another guy like that. Because of some dumb wig. It suits you. You chose it well. The curls... - Is the wig ok? - Yeah. - Are you coming or not? - Yes. - Yeah? - Yeah, we're coming. See you in a minute. What? You're gonna hook up. I know it. - I never dated Louis 14th before. - Silly. The Marquessa. It's the Baron Munchhausen himself! You're hungover. Don't focus on me, focus on the play. This afternoon, we have a public dress-rehearsal. Everyone, stand to attention. We're under enough pressure. If you want us to focus, get us fattened chicken, not this crap! You tease us, but you're not very Actors Studio. Hey, you're guests at our table. We welcome you tenderly and politely, please respect that. Tenderly, eh? Guys, stop fooling around. Or do you want to screw up again on stage? I'm totally focused. - We won't screw up. - Learn your lines, dude. She's focused even when eating a kebab. This is to get us in the mood, my friends. Give us a break! The king... was delivered kebab and pheasant. Straight from... straight from... the best Greek diner in Bobigny. His friends at court each dipped their French fries, in a sauce... so unique... and more commonly called "white sauce." You have amused me. Now eat! Thank you, kind sir. He's losing his shit! Alma? - Are you ok? - Yes. It's ok, I'm fine. Go back to bed, I'm coming. - What should I do? - Nothing. I'm calling the hospital. No, please don't. Shit! - Let them take care of you. - I can't go back. Wait, I have to sleep to be in shape at the theater tomorrow. I'm the one who got the part, do you get that? I'm the one who should do it. I've waited so long for this. I can't give up now. No, of course you can't. - I don't want to go. - No... If you take me to the hospital, I won't be able to rehearse. - Kristin will kick me out. - No, she won't. - She'll replace me. - You need your treatment. If I can't do it, you can't either. You can't do that to me. - Don't worry. - You can't. I'm with you. I promise to stay with you this time, ok? I'm here. If I get in, I'll never come back. A ride around Paris in a van, how cool is that? - We'll overtake everyone. - No... - I'm scared. - I won't leave you. I'm here. We'll rehearse in the ambulance if we have to. Don't worry, rest. You're ready for tomorrow, you know your lines. You've worked hard, it's ok. You know it all. I'm here. I'm here. Mom! I don't want it! Stay lying down. Don't yell, you'll wake everyone up. Please! I'll give you this shot to ease the pain. Not that! Please, Mom! Please don't let them! Try to calm her, ma'am, so I can give her the shot. - Where's Margot? - She's coming. Margot! Hey, you're not sleeping? Calm down, I'm here. They want to put me to sleep. I won't be able to go to rehearsal. I know, but you need your treatment first. We'll go to rehearsal afterwards. - Relax, I'm here. - No... if they drug me, I'll be too tired. We'll try again. Thank you. Keep her still. Maybe I could do it. - What? - The shot. - No, I'm giving her the shot. - I don't want it! Let me try, I know what she's like. You won't be able to do it without me. She won't calm down. I said no! No! That's my final word. You should get some rest, too. You have to stay strong for her. She has to get through this. - What stage is her cancer? - Don't say that word. Please, Amina, I have the right to know. She has to pull through, she has no choice. What would happen to me? I won't survive. Don't you see? But she's getting treatment. She'll be ok, right? I want you to be strong, very strong. They're going to operate, she can't return to the theater. It's too tiring. For the first time, I'm going to lie to Alma. She has to keep believing she's getting on that stage. She needs it. We have to hold out, the three of us. - Will you be strong? - Yeah. I'm here. Hello. I'll be right with you. I can't do it. If she can't do the role anymore... I can't replace her. I can't. You have to fight. And I need you. Opening night is in three weeks. I hired you for that, to replace her in case of a problem. You can't let me down. If I'd known you were friends, I'd never have hired you both. It's too problematic. I think I'd be happy if my best friend replaced me. And perhaps she'll return. What do we do? If you can't do it, I have to replace you now. And you won't be able to change your mind. I'm sorry, forgive me... What's your decision, Margot? I dunno. I've no idea. What about this t-shirt? Take it, I don't wear it anymore. I don't know what to take for the hospitalization. It's such a drag. Hey, don't worry. We'll find a way, it'll be fine. This sucks. If the rehearsals overrun, I can't make the treatment, if Kristin suspects, it's over. If the hospital thinks I'm doing the play, it's over too. Don't worry, we'll work it out. Nobody will notice a thing, you'll act every day, and the hospital won't know. Will you drive me after the rehearsals? Of course, you pain-in-the-ass, I can't drive! You're really good in reverse, I've rarely seen such talent. Like I'd drive you to the hospital, all 9 km in reverse. Thanks for not telling Kristin. I can do it. I can do it. Of course you can. Did you have food with your pills? - You're not eating enough. - I can't stomach anything. All I want is a huge ice cream. - Hello. - Hi. I'm the costume designer. I've come to measure you. Wasn't it tomorrow morning? The schedule changed, it has to be done today. It's fine, Cathy, come in. No, we were going to work on our lines. It's just a few measurements, it won't take long. Sorry, we have a lot of work to do. Stop being a pain. Come in, Cathy. Should I keep my t-shirt and pants on? Ah, so you're Margot? No, I'm Alma, she's Margot. Nice to meet you. I'm meant to take Margot's measurements. Yes, that was Kristin... she wanted to take my measurements for now. But as I'm here, we can do mine. Of course. I was told to measure Margot, they sent me a text this morning. I don't have much time. Let's do it. Is that too tight? No, it's ok. Are you for real? You're doing this under my nose? I don't know what to say... - Keep still. - It's Kristin... Why didn't you tell me before? Well, what should we do? What should we do? Tell me. This happens, and I'm meant to give it all up? Tell me to stop then. Go on. Go on, say it. Please, go on. How can we work in these conditions? Tell me! The dress isn't ready, the nanny let me down. We'll never be ready. It's ok, I've pinned it. - The dress can wait. - I'll finish tomorrow. Take him. Here, take this. - Don't bring that energy on stage. - I know. There's nothing in there. Remember when Alma made her entrance? I don't feel anything. Who gives a damn? Your job is to make us feel things. Are you writing it all down? Got it? What's she doing here? - Not your problem. - Why is she here? Concentrate! - Let it all out, Margot! - I can't! - Yes, let it all out! - I've nothing to let out! Why are you here if you've nothing to say? I can't do it anymore. Sorry, I can't do it! Settle your scores here! I can't do it anymore. Settle your scores here, Margot. Talk to him. Let's hear it. I came to this city because with so many tall buildings, I can show you the void on every corner. I can immunize you against vertigo. My child. I don't want you to fear the void when you grow up. Or feel like you're falling from one ravine to another. We don't want our kids to feel dizziness. We want them to be dizzying. Yes, I'll visit as soon as I can, I promise. I have to go see Alma. I'll call you later. I'll rest, Mom, don't worry. I have to go now. Kiss Ninouche and Dad for me, I miss you all. Kiss-kiss. Bye! Come on, you can't refuse. Move over, you shrew. Move. I'm sure your book's upside down. Go on... Go on, take it. Here. Ok. Will you write down everything you do? I'm glad you're carrying on for both of us. It's important. Tear-flavored ice cream? A chop of the axe. It was them... They gave her the strength to excel. They gave her the strength to excel. My great-grandmother worked in a textile factory that is now a Mexican diner. She lived here with her first two children. With her first two children... My child, this is where you shall be born. That was incredible, exactly what I wanted. In this land of exile... You're doing amazing things, today. See? I want to see it every time. Keep that presence, etch it in your body. Be confident. Why are you here? Again. Get back in position. You must do just that on opening night. Holy shit! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Wanna come eat with us? I can't, I've got things to do. Things to do, is that so? How about Monday night then? Monday night... we don't rehearse on Mondays. Exactly, just you and me. I dunno... maybe? What? - Did I say something weird? - No. I dunno. - You think you can just order? - I'm ordering. But it's up to you. It's stunning. I didn't think they'd make one for me. Kristin wants you to look perfect when you come back. It's only normal. I'll ask Cathy to shorten it, it's a bit long here. Where's your costume? Go on, put it on! Mine isn't ready, I'll get it soon. I'm so happy. So, so happy. You look perfect. A knock-out. Magnificent. It's beautiful. I met a guy here. - Already? - Yeah. - No way. - I swear. He was in the patio with me the other day. They always fall under your spell. You're unbelievable. Is he sexy? Sure is. You know me. - Introduce me. - If you're a good girl. Of course I am. - Look. - What? The script. I wrote it all down. We did up to the final scene today. - Let's see. - It's all there. What's this handwriting? Thanks for bringing it. I can read it to pass time. I finished my book. Looks good. I've got a gift for you. What is it? Are you a good girl? - Cool! - Look! Why did we never think of getting one? I know, right? I should go see Bastien and his wife with it. Hello, Anouche... I'm giving birth on your landing, I'm so sorry, Anouche! - Hello. - Already? Pretend we aren't here. We love it when you act. Where shall I start? Start from... - Naples. Go on. - Naples...ok. From Naples, Manhattan, La Chapelle, I'm back at the starting point. Get up. We're going back to the theater. Move! Cut the crap, you're not sick. - Please, come. - Look at me. That's enough. Stop it! Get up, please. - Stop this, you're not sick! - Don't get so worked up. This is all shit! Stop! You're not sick. Fuck! This isn't happening! You should be getting on that stage. It's your part, it's you they want. Please, ma'am. Calm down, ma'am! Come back, please! It's your part! It's you they wanted. Please! - They're all waiting for you. - It's ok, I'm here. Come on, please. Don't worry, she's coming. Come on, I'll take your things. Please. - Ma'am, stop! - I'm just getting her things! Let go! Shit, Alma! Your friend needs rest. Calm down, please. I can't believe you hid this from me. What would you have done? It's over. That's it, breathe. It's true. I swear, I'm happy to see you. To pick up my sheets? Just to be with you. What? You're cute without your wig. And you're cute without your crown. I'm happy you're here. I didn't bring you luck. I'm real sorry, miss, I don't know what to say. But I need my sheets tonight. Can it really shrink that much? It does defy the laws of physics. But I won't leave you up the creek, don't worry. I'll see what I can find to tide you over. I'd appreciate that, because... I won't manage. Unbelievable. Do you like animals? Dogs, to be precise. I dunno what I'll do with these sheets. Even like that you look pretty. Don't bother following me, we won't sleep together. Not in these sheets. That's a problem, 'cause I'm mad about you. I don't want anyone now, I've got nothing to give. I don't want anyone either. No, I'm serious. I don't want a relationship. I don't even have time for it. You don't have time, I've got nothing to give... that's not a great start. If we start out like this, we won't get very far. So... we won't hook up. No. Stop freaking me out. You seemed normal. - Sorry. - It's those evil sheets... I'm gonna give them to my kid brother. You have a kid brother? How old is he? - He just turned 12. - Such a young brother? - I don't see him often. - Where is he? They're in Switzerland. - Switzerland? - Yeah. - When did you abandon them? - It was... five years ago. Do you miss them a lot? Yes, I do. Dammit! Shit, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how late it was. I wanted to hear your lines, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I didn't notice the time, sorry. I brought you the belly. Forgive me. In 1920, by boat... In 1920, by boat... ... we tried not to sink... In 2020, by plane... ... sometimes we try not to sink, to cross from one shore to the other. Get some sleep, Margot. Seriously. You won't cope otherwise. You come on stage with Alma, with her sorrow, her anger. With your sorrow, your anger. That's a lot to handle. I'm bored without her. How is she? They let her go home for a few days. We rehearse all the time. She thinks she's coming back. I know what you're going through. But you must prepare yourself. What does that mean, "prepare yourself?" It means nothing. Go on, you prepare for death, I'm watching. Go on, show me. Show me. Show me what to do to prepare for death. I believe in miracles. Hurry up! Hurry! Your ocean liner awaits! All aboard. Hurry up, that woman'll see us! Ok? Hang on, almost there. Isn't it beautiful? - Get comfortable. - It's beautiful. Look! I've got a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you It's burning. Happy birthday, dear Alma... Blow, blow! We never used these boats. Next time, I'll bring a paddle. I can't paddle. - You can't drive, you can't paddle. - And you can? There you go. - Is she asleep? - Yes. Yeah, I'm real nervous. Don't tell me when you and Dad are coming. I don't wanna know which show. Wear whatever you want, even sweat pants are ok. I miss you, too. I miss you tons and tons. - Stop it, guys! - It's true. Ok, you're right. How can you act with your memory? Whether you blank or not, it's tonight. So listen up, deliver spicy Hawaiian sauce tonight. - You'll be fine. - We're coming to your opening night. Really? Are you sure? - It's sold out, everyone's coming. - Stop. All of Paris and the suburbs. Stop making her nervous, can't you see she's freaking out? The whole of Chelles is coming. - By busload. - Packed. - Stop it. - You're a star. I'll be your bodyguard. You'll end up in court! You're a memory lapse. In space-time. I touch you, I blank out. So? They got a large part of the tumor. I knew it! I knew it would work. You're coming back. She's coming back, it's amazing. We make a great team. A great team of Amazons. But the towels await you at the parlor. Not the towels! How do you fold them? In three. You're still not sure? I'm proud of you two. You're simply incredible. Incredible, and I love you with all my heart. Look what strong women you've become today. Amazons who fear nothing. Who never give up. I will always be here for you. Always. Breathe, it's ok, breathe. That's it. Release the tension. You bore that all alone. This is awesome news. It's amazing. What? Don't tell her. It didn't work. What? The tumor is still there. They tried everything, but it didn't work. Alma is going to leave us. My daughter is going to leave us. You ok? Are you sure? Go away, I don't want you to see me. Open the door or I'll knock it down. - Go away! - Open the damn door! Go away! Go away! I'm scared of being buried and scared of being cremated. I don't know what to do. Don't say that. Don't say things like that. But it's true. Nobody considers people who are scared of fire or claustrophobic. What do we do? Read it later. I can hear you! - Don't open it. - I won't. I didn't open it. You're annoying, you can read it later on. You'll see. Only you can read it. It's time to work on your lines now. I'm serious. - Open the door. - Margot, stop. Go away. - Open the door. - Go away! I don't wanna see you. I don't wanna hear you! Open up. Open the door now! Go away! I've got you! We'll do it here on the flat surface. - That's it. - Daddy. No, I'm not Daddy. Don't mix things up. Sorry. No worries. You can trust me. I can look after her. Go if you want. She won't want to see me, I tried yesterday. Try again today. Why doesn't she want to see me? That's not it. She doesn't want you to see her like that. I know. We can't not see each other. It's not possible. You will see her again. When? Give her time. Just give her some time. You brought me a new building. Yeah. Looks good, huh? Feels like we're in New York. Seriously? It's handcrafted. I'm going to die, Margot. It's not your fault. - Stop, you're getting treatment. - That's life. The operation worked, it's gonna be ok, don't worry. I'm proud of everything you've done so far. - You'll carry on, won't you? - Of course, don't be silly. You're just tired right now, it'll be fine. You're talking nonsense. Everyone misses you at the theater. - Really? - Hell yeah. Of course. Kristin's written her next show especially for you. She wants to work with you again, you're so lucky. - Kristin? - Yes! I swear. Yes. She told me so. I'm happy. You have to be ready. Come closer. Shit! You ok? No, I had 20 cents, I can't find them. Here. You're saving my life, thanks. Now you can help me. What with? Folding these. It'll be quicker. These small ones... fold them like this... edge to edge... two... three. - Like that? - Yeah. Almost. You've almost got it. Sorry. An extra fold for the big ones. - What's your name? - Margot. I'm Alma. I've never seen you before. - I'm always here. - I just arrived in Paris. I'm taking acting classes. I start soon. That is so cool! I'd never dare to act. But I've always wanted to be a star. It's true, for real! Watch. What do you think? You've got it. Seriously, you think I could act? My mom says it's in my blood. - Let's hurry, or we'll be late. - What for? My pal's birthday party, we have to buy beer first. And drop this at my mom's. - Help me carry the bag? - I can't, my washing... Don't worry, it's fine here. We'll get it later. You coming? - It's time! - Power huddle? You're gonna be fine. Close your eyes and breathe. Break a leg, Margot. Give it your all. Good luck, it'll go well. You got this. Now leave her alone. I'd be shitting myself. Fuck off! Stop making her nervous. It's gonna be fine. In two hours' time, you'll be so happy. I've a gift for you. - All my actors get one. - It's beautiful. Ok. Concentrate. Close your eyes. I'm proud of you. One century ago, my great-grandmother landed here. She was my age, 27 years old. She was already a widow and had crossed the ocean by boat to reach Mulberry Street. She uprooted herself from Naples with a chop of the axe. Manhattan was on the opposite shore. My child, this is where you shall be born. In this land of exile. My great-grandmother worked in a textile factory, now a Mexican diner. She lived here with her first two children. They gave her the strength to excel. And she transformed that strength, returning it to her children so they, in turn, could excel. Walking along Mulberry Street... Walking along Mulberry Street I can see the window, once again, that my great-grandmother spoke of so often. The tiny window through which she watched her children come home from school, in 1920. We too shall have a window to help us breathe on muggy nights. You have to find other ways of breathing when you're uprooted and far from your family. We will be at peace. Both of us, my baby. In this city which never sleeps, which never dies. And I'll buy you a fighting dog, when you're old enough to live. That was amazing, bravo! Did you hear that? - You have to go. - Did you hear? You have to go now. A cab's waiting. You have to go. Want me to come with you? No, I'll go on my own. It's ok. Here. It's for you. Agreed. I'll carry on, I promise. You can go in peace. I love you so much. I love you. I'm proud of you. Thank you for everything. Dear Margot, I'm writing this letter only you can read. You'll never be alone again. Even if we wanted to predict everything, we couldn't. Screw this disease! It hasn't won. It can never take away all we had. Nothing can take away our happy times. Absolutely nothing. We're a tight gang. I hold on to your smile, your long hair, the tears you held back for so long. I hold on to everything we had: the candles we blew out on store-bought cakes, the cigs we lit on the hotplate, the taste of mint you put in your laundry, how we danced to make the sun rise, our midnight coffee and croissants, the umbrellas we lost, our punctured socks, our lipsticks lost in our bags, and the smell of your face cream. I'm not far away. I'm just on the other side. And guess what, the other side is right next door. I'm just between the waves. We had time for everything. It was our trip, just the two of us. We truly found each other. That's what counts. TO AKÉLA TO MY SISTER FRIENDS THE BRAVES Subtitles by Katie Henfrey and Mariette Kelley
