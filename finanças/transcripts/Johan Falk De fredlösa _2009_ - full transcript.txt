THE OUTLAW - Yes? - I'll just leave it here. - Thank you very much. - Bye. Well, that's that. Huh? What the hell! Yes? What! When? Yes, I'm coming. Hello? Yes, that's me. I'm on my way in, but I have some... Yes, I'm just leaving. So unless there's something special... - Roger, can you take them. I have to go in. - No, damn it, Sophie. For once... No! I don't have time. Roger, they've killed Wexell. So. Johan. Do you have anything for me? You know I can't. - Hey. - Hey. - Yes... Damn. - Yes, that's okay. Thank you. Is there anything I can do, let me know. And we are sure it's her? Yes, the living room looks like... It took time to identify her. - Do we know it's...? - She was up against Black Cycles MC. We have three members in custody. And a file on all the threats she received. A prosecutor blown to pieces in her home... Four days before one of Sweden's most high-profile trials. All the journalists in the foyer are asking what we're doing. I hope you understand we need to show results. Patrik! Don't let me down. I can only confirm that a bomb exploded early this morning... at Prosecutor Monica Wexell's home. I can't say any more about the situation, as it may compromise the investigation... But I can say, however, we'll put all our resources... Will the case against Black Cycles MC be postponed? We'll notify you as soon as we know more. We need to concentrate on the investigation. I hope you will give us space to do our work. Thank you. Lasse here. I see Olle Blixt with braids standing and smoking. That's all we can see. Oh, wait... There may be more. Understood, Lasse. Waiting to hear from Patrick. He's here because he's good. He made a mistake, Dick. One hell of a big fucking mistake. But he listens and learns. Says who? Going to some damned Dr. Phil three times doesn't make him stable. He's thorough. He's a resource. We need him. You, fuck... Concentrate now. Now we're connected to the server. What have we got? We have eleven movements detected in the last two days. I'll bet a bottle of Raki that half of them are a deer. Yes, let's hope it's a deer. They are a hell of a lot worse in a fight. Let's see now... we know him. And him too. He's unlocking the door. Probably no one there. And two more. That's four in total. Who was it? And a deer. One point to you, Matte. Three leaving. One left. And two going in. Now we have three people in there, including Olle Blix with the braids. - We can't be completely sure. - And the deer? - One innocent little deer only. - Then you owe us some booze, Matte. 01 to all. Positions. Gently, so the gentlemen are presentable in court. - All set? - I'm set. See you soon. Police! Police! Show your hands. Turn around! Against the wall. Turn around. Easy now. We aren't here to dance. Turn off that shit. - Clear here. - You're sure? Of course. - 13-01, how's it going upstairs? - 13, upstairs secured and empty. 01, understood. Let's start questioning the detainees, right now. You can keep talking to me. My colleagues will take care of that. I have no idea. One of your friends tried something. Do you have any explanation for this? Were you trying to take us all on? What the hell were you thinking? You shouldn't do drugs if you're already an idiot. Are there any weapons, explosives... anything? - Answer me! - Johan. The dogs are looking. If there's something they'll find it. Huh? - The only thing we found was marijuana. - Marijuana? Enough for a small country. It gives us more amunition for trial. Weapons offences, unlawful threat and now this. But it doesn't help us right now. What's the conclusion? The Black Cycles weren't involved? Yes. What do we do then? What are our options? Do you really want to know? How frank can I be with you? All available means. Are those your words or theirs? Didn't you hear them say something official later? It's urgent. You know which rocks we have to lift. Lift them and find new ones. There isn't much more to say. - Do we really have anything? - We have what we always have. Not a thing and a standing order to solve it. Any more questions? What was that about? What the hell are you doing? Huh? Johan, can you come with me? What gives? Let's go in here. Have a seat. Please sit. What the hell is he doing? You're right. But he has ambitions and I've always admired that. He's been keen and determined. But never sloppy. He's careless or arrogant, or both. Everyone makes mistakes, I do. - But he puts his colleagues at risk. - I'm keeping an eye on him. I have a little fiction to write here before I can get on with my... Report. I should have taken another week of paternity leave. Hey, it's me. Call me. Goodbye. - You called me. - And you hung up. - Damn, Roger, we were on surveillance. - There's always something, huh... Surveillance, working, on the phone. How fucking convenient. How many times do we have to go through this? - That's how it is. - It's always the same. Your job is so damed important; your damned car, you damned salary... Your damned, 'I can't tell you anything because it's a secret.' When the hell did you last say "no" to them? No, just that. I'm so fucking tired of no. Sorry I bothered you. I thought it might be something important. Hey... We'll talk about it this evening, Sophie. - Hi. Are you in the house? - Yes. Has something happened? You could say that. We have a very upset prosecutor on the phone. - Who? - Monica Wexell. I'm sitting here on Gotland and I read in Aftonbladet... that you have not found my killer. The press draw their own conclusions. One person was in the house and the identity is difficult to determine. Eva Rosen. Born '53. We have been friends since high school. We take care of each other's houses when we're away. Was it Black Cycles? We searched their hang out, but found no links to them. I'll take the plane tomorrow. Patrik Agrell, GSI. Hello. May I ask you a question? Have you talked to anybody about this? Call no one in, and take a taxi directly to the airport without talking to anyone. Because I am officially dead? Better they believe that than try again. Okay. One more thing... J?gerstr?m? - Yes. - I want to conduct the investigation. Shall we change your diaper? It's dry. Do you know good Pappa's food smells? Are you going to get that? - I have nothing to say to him. - Tell him then. You don't want? Or, you're not able to? Stay here for a bit. I can't put up with this. Do you think I can? - Do you think I want this? - Talk to him then. - Yes? - It's me. We need to talk. Good, because I have to talk to you. - Okay, good. The place by the bridge? - Mm. I could have died during the last job. Because your colleague, Lasse, is so fucking unprofessional... He falls for a whore then he wants to get revenge. - You shit on me. - I didn't know, Frank. Believe me. - I don't give a shit what you want. - Really? You don't give a shit? Press the button now. A new identity for me and my family. It's what Tommy promised me. I'm stuck. A female prosecutor. The biggest case we've had in this city in years. You don't do that kind of thing without people talking. - Something you could find out, huh? - And then... There is no "button" like Tommy talked about. I can pass on your request and see what can be done. But it's a big fucking machine to launch. But if you do this... I can't promise anything. - Hey, Sofie? - Damn. Do you know... I can't talk now. I'm in the middle of... Can you hear me? I know where they're coming from. The bombs. I know where they are. Any questions before we go? See you there. Questions? Positions. - Wait, we have kids in there. - Break, break, break. What the hell is he doing? Wait here. Dick, damm it. Stop, get back... now! Here we go. - Police! Stop! - Down on the floor! Fucking idiots. I think I found something down here. Well, look at that. We'd feel a hell of a lot better if they'd just taken one. - Hey. - Hey. The advantage of being dead: no queuing. We just got an alarm. It's happened again. At least one person is dead after another attack on a prosecutor... after a bomb exploded in the house behind me a little while ago. According to police, no threats were made and they have no suspect yet. According to TV4 News, however, one person was arrested earlier today... on suspicion of weapons offences. Okay, we can sit here all day or we can get it over with. So I can go back to my eight square meters? I can't wait. What do you want from me? I've admitted it. I have a box of grenades. Two of them I gave to someone who needed them more. To whom, then? I forgot to check his ID. Was that stupid of me? You know what your grenades were used for, right? Yesterday, Wexell Monica. Today, Lotta Sundstedt. Not even 30 years old. She was. Assistant Prosecutor for two years. What could she have done to you? I'm saying, I didn't use the grenades; I just delivered them. Big difference. Check the penalties for that, you'll see. What did you get paid for them then? There are jobs you charge for... and then there are wothwile activities. What does that mean? That if you can sit here and play the hypocrite, so can I. It's a long list - long. Kroon. Isn't that it? Huh? Peter Kroon, Aschbergsgatan 35. The interview is suspended at 2:42. I want protection for you and Kroon. You can't put a bodyguard on every damn lawyer. No, but I can put one on you and Kroon, and I will. How long have you been here, Dick? It's a rhetorical question. You've been here long enough to know how we do things, huh? He put on his overcoat and I didn't even see the kid. No, but you heard the radio, right? You heard me? You can do something else for a while. I'll fix something in house. Surveillance or investigation. Personnel can arrange it. - You need a break from here. - You're fucking kidding. Since the fucking Brussels Sprout came here... I've been last in the queue every damn time. And damm it. I'm better suited than Lasse, and it turned out really well. Lasse knows when he's been a fool. You don't get it when I say it. But we knew he was guilty. We were also damn sure his kid was not, right? Now we'll leave this for a while. I want you back here later, but many people don't dare trust you. Hello. - Hi. Welcome. - Thanks. - Come and eat now. - No, I won't. Yes, you will. - Do you play cards or something? - No. Won't this be fun then...! Hello? Chris Amir. I can't answer. Leave a message. It's me again. Please call. We need to talk. - Who was that? - Work. It doesn't matter. Which? The job or nothing else matters? Wait, I want to talk to you. Who is so damn important, that you need to call the whole damn time? - Do you think I'm cheating? - What do you expect me to believe? You tell me nothing. There's something. Now tell me who you spoke to! Are you kidding me? Either you are so stupid you think I'm cheating... or you are so fucking pathetic you don't understand my job. Is that what you want? Is it? Mamma? Pappa? Dad was just... Come on. We'll go upstairs. - Thanks. - It's we who should thank you. Sorry I didn't phone back. I've been surrounded by... One of my guys told me... that guy you busted... had been sitting in a bar, going on about how he should be thanked. It was him who delivered the package. How fucking stupid is that. Hey, baby. - Hey, Sophie. - Hey. Need help with the mitten? - Shall I help? - Mm. I will... Push. Is it on? What we need to know is who bought the stuff. Describe him to Nyberg, and where he came from. I can do better than that. He looked me up. Maxim Morosov. What does he have to do with the Swedish legal system? Russian national Arrested in absentia for four murders across Europe. Suspected of at least eleven more... including the murders of a pair of journalists back home. - Damn, he looks like you, Patrick. - Mm. - What does Europol say? - He has several false identities. Are you quite sure it's him? According to the rumor we've heard it's definitely him. As far as we know he's on the hunt for a new bomb supplier. What the hell have we done to you? Hey. Will you be with us for a while? You have ended up among the best. We've won the Police championship in form-handling three years in a row now. I heard about management training. Will you be taking that shit now? I don't know. Probably. - You don't have a five I could borrow? - Here then. Right now, I know nothing. I don't know what they're planning. Well, that's nothing new. I know, I'm married to one of you. I really don't understand any of it. On the one hand, you're expected to be creative as hell. Pushing it to the limit all the time. You know what I mean. Then when you grab the damn thugs you should coddle them and be friends. What the hell kind of priority is that? Huh? - But I shouldn't be talking about it. - No, no, I get it. Kungsgaraget, about ten minutes, lower level. Take the car. Here, it's good therapy for paranoia. I get home and he's sitting on my couch! Who? Drive. Drive! Have you seen the damage you can do with that much C4? I'm only one who could have told you these things. But can you give me something? Do you know what this is about? If I say what I know now... ...do I have your word that you'll help get me out of here? It isn't about Morosov. He's only an employee. - How well did you know Tommy Ridders? - Tommy? Very well. But that was a year and a half ago, at least. 18 months ago the G?teborg police took in a large cache of weapons. Along with one... He's Russian, but from Latvia. He is called Igor Krilov. I read about it. Surveillance got him, right? The newspapers said it was Surveillance, but it was GSI. He went to jail for eight years. His family was deported. Without his help, they ended up in a caravan ghetto in Bulgaria. Then his daughter was raped and murdered... and later his wife killed herself. - So now he wants revenge. - Because he got caught? No, because the sentence was too harsh. The whole thing was rigged. - Was he innocent? - No. He's a real bandit; but it was rigged. It's just what I heard. - Did you and Tommy do this? - Tommy, not me. - Tommy had someone undercover. - Do you know who he was? How the hell would I know? That's how it works. But I heard Tommy went to his funeral. Someone clipped him. You can guess who. Do you understand my situation? You think you understand. But you don't. Because if you did, you wouldn't use me this way. I want out now, I want to... - The whole package. You can fix it. - Jump in. So Morosov asked Chris Amir to name a good supplier of explosives. Amir recommends the Rydell gang, now run by Frank Wagner. - Now we have two people working for us. - And neither one knows about the other. Delivery is set for tomorrow morning. At a gym before it opens. - Four fucking kilos. - Four fucking kilos of C4. The problem is we can't take them. Not there. Frank set up the deal. No one else knows about it. If we jump in there... We can't burn him now. He's sacrificed enough. We owe him that. - What's the solution? - That we stumble upon them. A routine stop. We see something amiss, and discover what they have in the car. The exhaust pipe? Come with something better. I'll talk to Matte, so he can prepare something. I'll see what we have on Igor Krilov. Hello? Hey. I'm looking for this case file. Where's your code number? Let me see. What if someday you could clear a case before it's archived. idiot...! Hello. It's all ready to go. It will happen soon. You look good in uniform. Perhaps you should work in Traffic. Here. Let's go. We're picking up one more. Hello. Welcome. -01 To all. We're in position. - In position. I think our dear guests have arrived. They're going in. All clear around the car. Patrick, it's your turn now. Hey. What's up? - Good. Yourself? - Yes, it's cool. This is Morosov, here to buy some stuff. What the hell? Did you see that? Drive in. What the hell? 16-20 is coming. 01 to all. I'm backing off. 16-20, 98-12 -16-20, 98-12 - What the hell are we doing? - What can we do? - We'll improvise. Fucking smart cops, Lie down! I'll go around! Move! Police! Police! Don't move! - It took it in the vest. - Officer down. Send back up! I can't stop thinking about it. It's so damned unreal. I haven't even seen my house yet. And Eva. - Sit down. - Thanks. Why us? You and me... but Lotta Sundstedt? Who would have a quarrel with her? - So... - What are you thinking? I believe she helped me write a submission last spring. In one case, you led the inquiry, so I want you to look up something. It's me. Can you talk? I don't know if I should laugh or just lie down and die. - It all went to hell, I kown that. - What does it mean for you? That you couldn't pull it off? And now, here I am again. In a situation I can't control, with a professional killer. What happened to my colleague? Well, he did just fine, thanks. I dug up the Krilov investigation. You've got to help me understand what I'm seeing here. In the surveillance image there are the weapons in a red car. In the black and white copies, not a word about the car's color. The car they stopped when they caught him with the weapons was a red Mazda 626 But on the first image from file the car was blue. - They planted stuff, huh? - I just know what I was told. Tommy's guy made the decision and Tommy used it. - They framed him. - With his own stuff. - They still framed him. - I can't talk any more now. - We'll work something out. - Good. "I have no idea what's happening. I'll let you know when I know more. Don't call" - Do you understand? - Yes, we can do it. Find five errors. No? Do you know what irony is? That you must have colour vision to get into the Police Academy. It's our fault, Patrik, that a guy we locked up... sends people to blow up our prosecutors. You're wrong. I know exactly what you think. It was an individual decision, it wasn't GSI You knew about it. - The culture comes from here. - Oh, does it? Did we say we have the right to manipulate evidence?... that we can cross the line. - Do we know where the line is? An assistant prosecutor blown up because Tommy crossed the line! What are you gonna do about it? - What am I going to do? - Yes! The two responsible for this no longer exist. We can just make sure it doesn't happen again. But no matter what you think, Johan... There's no one in GSI who doesn't prefer it here in the light. - Forget it and move on. - It's not forgotten. But move on. Anything wrong with that? Go back to the investigation. If it feels better, it's an order! Hello. Pappa will say goodnight when he comes home. You've seen too many spy movies. You want to talk or not? "Secret police group revealed Using illicit methods" "The picture revealed: Police pay criminal" - How much of this is true? - You know how much that is true. No. I know nothing. You know nothing, I know nothing. Nobody knows anything! That's just it. So when you ask how much is true, what do you mean? - What do you think I mean? - It can't be traced back to us. GSI has its own structure. They assist the police and are a spearhead against organized crime. If they've been doing this stuff it isn't approved from above. Good. We can't keep them. You realize that, right? Yes. Yes. One more time. Exactly what does this mean? GSI is engaged in serious illegal activities in the name of the police... Igor Krilov was convicted with evidence GSI planted in his car And I want the immediate suspension of Patrik Agrell. I know. Yes, I know Frank, I've read it too. What are we going to do about it? Do you know what this means? Where is my identity protection? This is exactly what I was talking about. - I know. - I'm switching off the phone. So don't try to get a hold of me. It's over now. - No, Frank, don't do that. - Sorry, that's all I can do. Yes? - What the hell are we doing? - I don't know. We could ask our criminal friends to take care of a certain journalist. - Lisa has quit and wants to leave. - I don't think he's alone. - We going to get more defections. - What the hell is happening? It's going to hell for GSI, Johan. That's what I think is happening. Johan, where are you now? Where am I? In the car, at home. Leave there and don't come to the police station today. - Has something happened? - Just do it. Nadja, Robin, Max? Whatever happens, you take it easy. Pappa will be okay. Okay? - Patrik Agrell? - Couldn't you have picked a different place? Can you come with us? I'll put on my shoes. Hello. We have to search your property for evidence. You are welcome to observe as a witness. "Meeting with known criminals" It isn't about me, Sofie. I have kids. You know how I live. You've met them, damn it! It isn't me I'm worried about. It's them. I know that, but please... So far, it's just one image. A pixellated image in the newspaper. No one knows it's you. Amir? - I think I may have been seen. - When? Frank Wagner may have seen me. When I sent my text message, I think he saw me. - Can you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. So if he saw me... And now this. - Amir? - Fuck! I'll fix this. Okay? - Amir? - I'm here. - I promise, nothing will happen to you. - "Nothing will happen... " It isn't over yet. Can you hear me, Sophie? It isn't over. - He will kill again. - What is he planning? What is he planning? Amir? Pappa? - Regional Communications Center. - It's Sofie Nordh from GSI. We have a possible shooting at R?vk?rvsv?gen 87 Can you send a car and an ambulance? - We'll see who's available. - Thanks. He was shot. My contact... he was shot. Would you like something to drink? I'll go and fetch some water. - Hello? - Hey. It's me. I'm here with the newspaper in front of me. I may be completely off base... but what it says in the article are my own words. Do you know who that was? It was Dick. Where is our camera, Roger? Why isn't it there? Do you know what you've done? Do you understand?! What the hell did you get out of it?! What? What the hell did you get?! Two children! How are you going to live with that? Is it true your former employee Tommy Ridders, now deceased, Planted evidence in Igor Krilov's car in February 2008? If you know, why do you ask? Tommy Ridders planted nothing, but his informant took the initiative. How long have you known about it? Kroon, what the hell is this? A show for the fucking peanut gallery? Who's out there? J?gerstr?m? Anybody else? Won't one of you come in and discuss our conversation about this? My wife and my three children watched... when you came to pick me up. They saw you rooting through my stuff. We don't even do that to people who deserve it. So you withheld important information about possible criminal activity... in the investigation of Igor Krilov? What is it? - J?gerstr?m here, I want you to come in. - Is that your idea of police work? One prank call and you begin bringing people in? - I didn't think you were a hooligan, Johan. - No, neither did I. Until I came home and was met by a fucking police convention. There has been a fatal shooting. A guy named Chris Amir. - What's going on, Johan? - Why? Are you going to arrest me? Nobody wants to arrest you, Johan You're not suspected of anything. - We need to hear your information. - Oh hell, fun times. Johan, bringing Patrik in has nothing to do with the newspaper. It concerns the file on Krilov you signed out the day before yesterday. You know I wasn't working here when it happened. - We need to talk, so come in now. - Or else what? If you don't follow my orders we can't watch your back. What does that mean in plain language? - How many are there in the room? - It's just the two of us. It's like this.. listen to me... I have a man out there who risked his life for us. When it begins to show up in the newspapers, do I know you? If what's in the newspaper is true... you can't imagine the police are behind it. You understand that much. J?gerstr?m? Huh? Then I wish you a good day and hope you are proud of what you do. How are the kids then? I don't know. I haven't talked to them. But they always take in ten times as much as you think. He was afraid. I said everything would work out, he shouldn't worry about... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - What could I do? Not a damn thing. - They know what they're involved in. Do any of us know? Huh? - He knew something... Amir. - What? I didn't find out. Morosov? Something's going to happen, Johan. We are at the police press conference concerning the attack... on a man in his 30s, who was well known to police. - Here's Police Chief Lisbeth Franz?n. - I can't give any details. It might be related to previous deeds... But we're not basing that on anything. I refer to our press officer... How about the reports... that your own special unit works side by side with criminals? If... If these reports should prove correct... I deny all knowledge of it. And if something like that has occurred, and I say if... Then, it has been on individual officers' own initiative and... - I not getting any help, huh? - Hey, Chris Amir... have you heard? Morosov got him too. He was the same as you. Do you understand? He knew something. Is there anything going on? It's worth more to me than to you. I hope it solves it for everyone; but if it doesn't, well... What do you mean? Damn! What do we do now? We can't just fucking sit here. Hello. I have a personal alarm. They'll be here in a couple minutes. You haven't pushed it yet. isn't that a bit strange? Sit down. Sit! You haven't pushed the alarm... So how the hell would you explain that I am at home in your apartment? Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! Who do you see now? Either you see Frank Wagner, who has worked for you for over three years. Or it's a psycho... who has no problem killing anyone, any time. So who is it? If it's me... ...then you're the only one here who still has something left to lose. What do you want from me? I have fulfilled my part of the contract! I've never had any agreement with you. I stand by what I said. The police don't operate outside the rules. If it happened to you, I am sorry. This is my number. What happened with Wexell and the assistant prosecutor... ...it doesn't stop there. Because I know who will be next. Who? - Who? - You could call me and ask. But the police don't work with infiltrators or outside the rules. You know what it will cost. - J?gerstr?m. - It's me. Tell me what we know. We know nothing. Falk doesn't answer, Agrell is in custody. We're cut off. There's going to be another attack. Is there no way to find out something? We have nothing, Lisbeth. What do you know? I think I know what I have to do. Don't go home, I'll ring again. Okay, you win. Tell me. It is easy to have principles when you can afford them, right? Tell us. Thank you. It helps to have contacts higher up, huh? You can go now. Then you should call Franz?n on her private number. Hey, it's the Boss. We have to mount one hell of an operation. Fast. - But what about Franzen? - It's on her orders. - Okay. Good, thanks. - What? They want us to come in. - Do you know what's going on out there? - We're targeting Black Cycles. You kill wasps one by one or you go straight to the nest? Yes, I know, but I don't care what you're doing. You must evacuate now. We have bomb dogs on the way, fire trucks... everything. - If you are wrong... - And if I'm right? Will you take responsibility then? No, that's right. Who called about the evacuation? Come over here. Hey. Hey. We're waiting for the SWAT team. We know it's a bomb threat. You know what to do, so get ready. Cordon it off so no one gets in. Is it evacuated now? Yes, I think. It should be. Stick around. We may need you in there. Keys and such. The building is vacated. You can go in now. The dogs are searching. When they've finished we'll get some answers. I want two men on this side and a couple on the other side. Understood. - Have they found anything? - Not yet. Damn. - What, nothing? - No, nothing. Not a trace. - Did the dogs search everywhere? - Absolutely. If there's nothing here, what does it mean? Was he wrong? Is this disinformation? If that's so, and it was planted by Morosov... then we've burned our source now. Wait. Hey, you. Hello! Who's this? Who is he? Lager, the judge, On leave since last fall. I know who he is. We're in the wrong place. David Lager was the trial judge in the Krilov case. - Lager. - Are you David Lager? Johan Falk from Special Initiatives. Are you home... alone? Yes, I'm home alone. Get out of there! We believe you're going to be attacked. - Who am I talking to? - What? Where's Frank? Get him! Go! Lasse, corner. Secure out here. Police! Stay down. Restrain that bastard. - Are you okay? - Yes. - How many were they? - Two. - Are you sure? - Yes, I think so. Are you okay? Sophie? Come on. How are you? - What the hell, you're bleeding. - Fuck it, it's just a scratch. - You need a hospital. - How the hell would that work? Help me up. Help me up then! It's clear. Empty. It's burning up. Get out. I want first and foremost to say a big thank you to the entire corps... for today's operation at City Hall.
