I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY-- YOU DIDN'T MEAN? YOU DIDN'T MEAN. WHY DID YOU SAY IT THEN, MICHAEL? I WAS AFRAID-- AFRAID OF WHAT? THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY FEEL SOMETHING? YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I FEEL. YEAH, WELL NEITHER DO YOU. LET'S JUST MAKE IT SIMPLE, OKAY? YOU TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER. NOT ANYMORE. GUYS, COULD WE GO HOME NOW? I'M TIRED. HEY, LILY. I'M GOING TO STAY HERE WITH MY FAMILY FOR AWHILE. WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME? C'MON, LIL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY MOTHER'S CLOTHES? DON'T TOUCH THEM! THEY'RE NOT YOURS, THEY'RE HERS! WHAT'S GOING ON? MICHAEL, I -- LILY! LILY! LILY! I HATE HER, I HATE HER! I'M SORRY, HONEY. BRENDA DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT-- NOT HER! WHAT IS IT, HONEY? WHY DID SHE LEAVE ME? FAITH? NO, MOM, MOM! OH, SWEETIE. MOM DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE US. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO. WELL, WHY DID IT HAPPEN? WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO US? I DON'T KNOW, HONEY. I ASK MYSELF THE SAME THING TOO. MOM LOVED YOU. DON'T YOU EVER FORGET THAT. MOM LOVED YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING. BUT WHERE IS SHE, DAD? SOMETIMES...SOMETIMES I MISS HER SO MUCH. I JUST WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS, LIL? SHE'S RIGHT HERE, AND SHE'S RIGHT HERE. AND THAT'S WHERE SHE'LL ALWAYS BE WHENEVER WE NEED HER. IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED OUT FOR GOOD, THAT THIS SCULPTING THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT. IT WAS DIFFERENT. FOR A YEAR. LOOK, I CAN'T HELP IT, I GOT TOYS IN MY BLOOD. FORGET IT. WHY? BECAUSE I CAN'T TRUST THAT YOU'LL BE THERE FOR ME. THAT IS REALLY NOT FAIR. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR YOU. BUT YOU WEREN'T HERE. I NEEDED YOU HERE. YOU WALKED OUT AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME, AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST LET YOU WALTZ BACK IN BECAUSE SOME LITTLE WHIM OF YOURS DIDN'T PAN OUT? THAT IS NOT WHY I CAME HERE.

JAKE'S COMING BACK. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK-- I JUST THOUGHT WITH JAKE GONE YOU'D SEE HOW MUCH I COULD DO FOR-- WERE YOU AFTER JAKE'S SPOT FROM THE BEGINNING? NO! NOT FROM THE BEGINNING. I WAS AFTER YOU FROM THE BEGINNING. HEY, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WERE DROWNING WHEN I MET YOU. MICHAEL, WAIT. LET'S TALK. LET'S NOT LOSE A GOOD THING HERE. I DON'T LOVE YOU, BRENDA.
