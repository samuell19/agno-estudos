[Clattering] [Clattering] [Door opens] [Footsteps] Hi. Hey, darling. What are you doing up so early? I am just making sure that my husband knows how much I love him. I got you a little present. [Chuckles] What's this? It's a going-away present. Well, honey, I, um... I'm only gonna be gone for a couple of days. I know, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna miss you. Tell you what. I'll, um... I'll call you when I get in. All right? OK. I love you, baby. I love you, too. [Engine starts] [Tires screech] [Tires screech] Elizabeth? Uh! Aah! [Explosions] [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Lock turns] Yeah. The big one. Oh, hi, Mrs. Spencer. Is something wrong? Oh, it's just a couple of loose wires. Glad to hear it. I saw you come in earlier. Were you at a funeral? Oh, yes. I'm sorry to say that my uncle passed away. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. You let me know if you need anything. I sure will. Love the new hair. Oh, thank you. Hey, get back to work. What do you think I'm paying you for? [Engine starts] There's my beautiful bride! Ohh! 5 long nights. I have no idea how I survived. Oh, it felt like forever! I sprayed my perfume on your pillow. Did you notice? Oh, yeah, I noticed. Didn't help me sleep, though. Ha ha ha! And you brought me flowers. They're beautiful! So, tell me about it all, baby doll. Did you find any antiques for big daddy? Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't. And what do I need to do to get an answer? You can do anything you want. People might be watching! So what? We're moving anyway. Let's give them something to talk about. OK? Ha ha! No, you don't! Hoo hoo! Whoo! Oh... Damn. You make me feel like a teenager all over again. Are you OK, baby? Yeah. Just give me a second. Honey, what is it? Do you need me to get you a doctor? No, no. No, no. I'm fine. Could you pass me the water? Oh, sure. What is it? Asthma. Had it since I was a kid. I should have told you. Yes, you should have. Why didn't you? I didn't want to scare you off. Beautiful woman like you and an asthmatic old carnie like me. Don't you know? You couldn't scare me off if you tried. That's better. Thanks. OK. Oh... So, young man, do you have any more secrets you'd like to tell me? That's the last one, honest. The rest of me is in fine working order. Oh, you don't have to tell me that. You're almost more man than I could take. What do you mean, almost? I don't know. Maybe this time, I'm gonna be the one catching mybreath. Damn, girl, you are something else! Ooh! Man: It's just a technicality, just a formality, but I just want to make sure that you feel that you know what you're doing. Husband: Oh, I do, Jim. Oh, I'm sure. I'm exactly sure what I'm doing. Well, thank you, darling. You didn't have to do that. It's my pleasure. What Daniel's setting up is a living trust in your name. Well, OK, if you're sure that's what you want. Are you, sweetie? If anything happens to me, I don't want you worrying about any relatives crawling out of the woodwork with their hands out. Danny, you know I don't like to hear you talk like that. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Yeah, I know, but you can never be too careful. I never had a whole lot of money, and, well... Winning the lottery just kind of blindsided me. That's why the first thing I did was hire Jim, the world's best financial adviser. Well, what you need to do... is sign right here. OK. Jim: There we go. OK. Daniel: Hey, honey, when you coming to bed? Yeah, just a second, sweetie. I found some incredible antiques... a beautiful old desk, late 18th century. Man: It's good to see you folks. Thank you for coming. Thank you for your support. Woman: Thanks so much for coming. Thank you for your support. Thanks for coming. Good to see you. How much longer do we have to keep this up? [Sighs] I seem to recall you complaining at the last fundraiser. Probably. It's all so... hoity-toity. Hoity-toity? You're starting to sound like my grandmother. I look like your grandmother. Teresa, trust me, you do not look like her. Honest? Honest. Teresa: You're a terrible liar. Hi. Uh, I'm Francis Sweete. Nicholas Landon. This is Teresa Abbott, my campaign manager. Nice to meet you, Terry. I don't recognize your name from the guest list. Miss Sweete? Oh, is there a problem? Because I have my invitation. Oh, no, no, of course not. I was just on the organizing committee. Do I happen to know you? No. I've just been following your campaign, and I have to say, I find you so intriguing. Intriguing? Yeah. I mean, a hotshot lawyer becoming a congressional candidate... you just don't see that every day. Well, I'm not planning to give up my day job just yet. From what I hear, you could retire whenever you want. For me, it's more about making a difference. You see? And that's what I find so intriguing. Um, I'm thinking of taking off a little early, if you don't mind. Really? Teresa, you haven't eaten yet. Actually, I'm feeling a little queasy. I think I've had one too many cheese balls. I'll see you tomorrow. Nice to meet you, Miss Sweete. Yeah. That's too bad. She seems like a nice girl. I, uh... hope I'm not interrupting anything there. Are you two seeing each other? Me and Teresa? No, no. We're just friends. Oh. OK. Can I get you a drink? I would love that. Thank you. It's right this way. I've lived in Redding most of my life. I like it here. It seems really nice. I'd have to say Rome is my favorite city, though. I just love everything about it... the architecture and the cuisine and the outdoor cafes. I love how open and affectionate everyone is. I like to see the little girls holding hands and the grown men holding hands. My late husband and I went on our honeymoon there, and it wasn't long after that that I lost him, so... I'm sorry to hear that. No, no. It's OK. It's been a long time. And how about you? What's your favorite city? Surprisingly, I'd have to say Rome, as well. Really? And for the same reasons. I know where to get the best apple pie on the entire planet, and their coffee is pretty good there, too. The entire planet? Yeah. I don't know. That sounds like some pretty special pie. I'm not sure I should pass that up. Are you attached? Are you asking if I'm available? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I guess I am. Well, let's see. I'm single, no kids. I am a corporate account, and I live in Seattle, and I like long walks in the rain and hot buttered popcorn with parmesan cheese. And how about you? My wife died almost two years go. Oh, Nicholas, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I'm so sorry. No, no. It's OK, but thank you. Kathy and I were married for 9 years. Wow. And you've been alone ever since? Yeah, I guess so. Is two years too long? Oh, I don't know. I guess everyone has a different idea of what a long time is. I've been alone for 5. That, I find hard to believe. Well, I don't have to tell you. When you've had a wonderful relationship like that, it's just very hard to replace. Are you planning to stay in Redding for a while? Maybe... if there's a good enough reason. Yes. Those papers should be coming through right now. OK. Yeah, I got it. All right. I'll take a look at this and see if we've got a case. Please, Detective, move quickly on this. We're dealing with a murder here, or murders. All right, listen. Don't do anything foolish. I'm gonna be talking to the Redding detective division, so I'll be in touch with you. Thank you. Thank you for everything. There certainly is good reason why Mr. Landon's campaign is getting so much support. Uh-huh. Thank you again so much for your generosity, Mr. Wasserman. All right. I will get back to you with the date. OK. Great. Thank you again. Bye. Ha ha! Were you even listening? Your campaign just got the largest contribution in the entire state, and you're acting like you don't even care. Wasserman came through? That's great news, Teresa. Huh! You are still mooning over her. It's been two weeks. Mooning? Now you're really starting to sound like my grandmother. Wasserman wants to do lunch. All right. Make the arrangements. Did you ask her out? No, I did not ask her out. She lives in Seattle. Oh. I'm sorry. No, you're not. I... All right. I don't know. I just... I didn't think she was right for you. [Telephone rings] Mr. Landon's office. One moment, please. It's Francis Sweete. Thank you. Hello, Francis. It's really nice to hear from you. Man: Thanks very much. Nicholas. Hi. Hey. I'm sorry I'm late. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. No, no, just a few minutes. OK, good. You look stunning. Oh! Thank you. I don't feel very stunning. I've had back-to-back meetings since 8 AM this morning, and I feel like I haven't slept in days, but thank you anyway. You've been busy. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I hope I got that right... one cream, no sugar? Yeah, exactly. Thank you. You remembered. How could I forget? Yeah. I've... I feel like I just get my feet on the ground and I'm taking off on another plane. You must know what I mean. And how are you? How are you doing? I'm Good. Busy. Typical life of a candidate. Right. Lots of travel, lots of meetings, lots of shindigs, as Teresa likes to call them. Do you want to take a walk? Yeah. Yeah. That sounds great. Good. OK. I just felt like things were moving too fast. I didn't want you to get the wrong impression of me. Francis, it was a wonderful evening. Neither of us have anything to be ashamed about. I know. I just... that's just not like me. It's not like me, either. Why did you come back? Well, there are some prospective clients here that I could meet, and, um... No. That's just not true. I came back here to see you. You have no idea how good that makes me feel. Really? Really. Thank you. Oh, Nicholas, it's beautiful! I had no idea. I haven't been able to bring friends up here for a while. Kathy spent her last few weeks here under palliative care. It was, um... It was pretty painful. I can imagine. Wow. This is an awfully big space for one person. Yes, it is. [Drawer opens and closes] I just don't think Kathy would want you living like a hermit. No. You're right. She definitely wouldn't. So... do you actually ever cook in here? Me? Yeah. No, I.. usually eat out. I used to. It's a great space for entertaining. Cathy and I used to like entertaining here. What do you say... ...we continue the tour of the house I'd like that. Okay. Oh, wow! This is just beautiful! I'm really happy you like it. We should go see the rest of the house. Oh. Yeah, um... We could. Or... we could stay here, and you could just tell me when you want me to stop, OK? OK. Now? No. Now? No. Now? How about now? [Door opens] [Knocking] Hi. Miss Sweete. Hi. Terry, isn't it? Teresa. Uh, Nicholas isn't actually in right now. Oh, OK. I'm supposed to be meeting him for lunch, but I'm very early, so... Uh, can I get you a coffee, water? No. I'm fine. You just go about your business. [Clears throat] I really like this town. It's small but sophisticated, you know? I think I could be happy here. I imagine you could. Hmm. So, how do you like working for Nicholas? He's probably the nicest guy I've ever worked for. You two are close, aren't you? Yeah, I guess. But not too close. Excuse me? Well, I've just always found that friendships with superiors can be such minefields, especially when it's a man and a woman. Well, Nicholas and I don't have that problem. No little, uh... office crush? No. Never. Oh, good. Just curious. He's told me a lot about you, but you know men. They always give you the abbreviated version, so... It's funny. He hasn't told me very much about you. [Ring] I'm sorry. I think that's my cell. There he is. Hello. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. I'll see you there. OK, bye. Well, I guess I'm meeting him at the restaurant, so we will have to finish catching up another time. Maybe we can have lunch. Looking forward to it. Bye. Bye. "We'll have to catch up some other time." Ohh! Is something bothering you? No. No. I'm just getting some fresh air. Everything's just hunky-dory. Are you sure you're OK? Absolutely. I'm just finishing up the official letter of gratitude for Mr. Wasserman. Good, good. I'm heading out for a while. I'm driving Francis to the airport. Is she going back to Seattle? Yeah. Wow. She travels a lot. Yes, she does. Well, you know what they say about long-distance relationships. Give it a rest, Teresa. I know you don't like her. Hey. I like her. It's just that statistically, long-distance relationships require more work. That's all. Francis: Come on, Nicholas, live a little. We can fly to Paris this weekend. Nicholas: What about my brother? They're expecting us. We can visit him next weekend. You're right. Let's do it. I'm gonna ask Francis to marry me. You're kidding. You've only been an item for two months. I'm serious. But why get married? Why not date for a year, you know? Live in sin for a while. That's just it. That would feel completely wrong. When Kathy died, a part of me died with her. Francis changed all that. I think you're moving way too fast. I love her. She loves me. Why wait? You barely know her? I know her. Yeah, but... I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. OK, OK. I get it. You're in love. Teresa, I think I finally met the perfect woman. Well, for the record, the only place you're gonna find perfect is in the dictionary. Wow. You're just radiating support right now. Nicholas, I'm sorry. I amhappy for you. But I'm also watching your back. Friends do that. Alright comon! I'm gonna kick your ass some more. I don't know if you are on today girl. [laughter] Are you sure you are ready? Let's see what you got! Alright! Here it comes. I hate it when you leave me, baby girl. I know. I do, too, but it's just for a few days, and you know, we're gonna have a whole mansion to furnish. Antiques are a good investment. We want to do this right. What's the hotel number where you're staying? Actually, I couldn't find a hotel. I'm gonna stay in this bed and breakfast, but I don't know the number, so you just call me on my cell whenever you need me. Well, you be careful out there, baby girl. You come home safe to daddy, you hear? Mmm. I will. Don't you get me started. I'll never be able to stop. OK. You win, but you hurry back. I will. I'll be thinking about you the whole time I'm gone. [Engine starts] Delivery. From your favorite Italian deli. Ah. That looks great. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, sorry, Terry. I should have gotten something for you. We can share. No. That's all right. I have a meeting, and I am late. So... Would you like to find someplace secluded and have a picnic? Can you hold that thought for just a minute? Sure. I need to run off these letters to my campaign contributors. OK. Damn. What is it? I forgot to ask Teresa to leave me the address files. Is that a problem? Well, it is for me. I'm liable to delete everything, and she'll have to start all over again. Well, I could do it. You sure? Sure. It's what I do. Great. Excuse me. OK, let's see. Wow. Very impressive list of contributors. You have had a good year. Yes, I have. [Computer beeps] OK. Well, now that I have spared you from Teresa's wrath, are you still in the mood for a picnic, or would you like to eat here? Francis... Yes? I don't know. In the office? Well, we could go on the picnic. It's up to you. No. Thanks. I don't want you to leave. I don't want to go, but you know I live in Seattle, and there's only so much I can get done offsite, so I'm gonna have to go, tomorrow at the very latest. What is it, sweetheart? Nothing. Did Teresa say something about me? Why would you say that? Because she doesn't like me. Of course she likes you. Well, she's just not very nice to me, really, but it's... She has a lot on her plate. If you want, I can talk to her. No. Francis... There is nothing anyone can say or do that can come between us. You are impossible. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Come here. What? I want to ask you something. What is it? You look so serious. I know this is kind of sudden and all, but... What is it? Will you marry me? Oh, my god. Yes. Yes, Nicholas, I'll marry you. Francis: All that I am and all that I have, I offer to you. Nicholas: I give myself totally to you... I vow to be true and faithful... All the days of my life. For as long as we both shall live. Hey, sexy girl! Hi! Oh, I missed you so much! Did you miss me? You know I did baby. I miss you everytime you go away. What are you still doing tinkering with those little things. Old habit I guess. Did the movers come? End of the week. I thought we'd be all packed up by now. Yeah we're gettin' there. Are you okay? I'm good. How abou you? Yeah, I'm good. Why don't you walk with me? We go look at my little beauties okay? So, tell me about your trip. You buy anything for the new house? Well, the only thing worth bidding on was taken right out from under me. Who would do a thing like that to my baby girl? It was some old rich Texan. He bought that 14th-century tabletop I wanted. You should have outbid him. I got plenty of money. Oh, yeah, well, it was overpriced, and there wouldn't have been any resale value, so... I've been thinking. We don't need a whole house full of fancy antiques, and it's not gonna be finished for a few more weeks now, so maybe... These look a little dry. You're away an awful lot, and I want my wife home, here, with me. Could you put this inside for me, sweetheart? I'll be right in. Thank you. [Keypad beeping] Uh, yeah. Antique Warehouse and Auction? Yeah. I understood you had a 14th-century tabletop on the auction block a couple days ago. You sure? 14th century. High bidder was a Texan fella. Well, I guess I got the wrong information. No, that's OK. Thank you. [Beep] [Ring] Nicholas: Hello. This is Daniel Nash. Who the hell is this? This is Nicholas Landon. Listen, you son of a bitch. You stay away from my wife, or I'll tear your heart out! Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You stay away from Monica! Look, pal, I don't know any Monica. Then why is your number in her phone? I don't know. This is a private law firm you've reached. [Dial tone] Monica? Yes? Down here. You promised you'd feed my plants. Daniel: What do you mean? The fertilizer. You said you'd take care of them, and you didn't. You are a bad, bad boy. I thought they looked fine. You seem a little tense. Monica, we need to talk. Yes? What is it? [Gasping] [Coughing and gasping] Monica! You shouldn't get yourself all excited, Daniel. You know it aggravates your asthma. [Gasping] Please... Oh, stop your whining! If you hadn't had all that money, I wouldn't even have given you the time of day. You're a slug. Do you hear me? Just a repulsive old slug. I... should have been here, but... he wanted me to pick up those stupid antiques. Mrs. Nash, it's not your fault. [Sobbing] What happened? It appears it was an accident. He knocked over a container of bleach. It reacted with a bucket of fertilizer. The fumes, coupled with his asthma... Oh! Mrs. Nash, is there someone I can call for you? No, no. I just don't understand. [Sobbing] The coroner will release the body after a preliminary examination. Should just be a couple of days. Nothing to worry about. Um... here. If you need to talk to someone, that's the number of a grief counselor. [Crying] I'll just, uh, let myself out. [Door opens and closes] [Knock on door] I'm busy, Mrs. Spencer. Honey, can I talk to you for a minute? I just wanted to give you my condolences. Excuse me? Another funeral. I saw you get out of your pickup, and... OK. Thank you. [Lock turns] [Door closes] [Footsteps] [Keyboard clicking] Uh, excuse me? Oh, hey, Terry. Just one second. I just need to, uh, finish this up for Nicholas. [Computer beeps] OK. What can I do for you? Well, for starters, you can get out of my chair. Jeez, I'd love to, but Nicholas gave me this whole pile of work, so... Well, then, we've got a problem, don't we? I don't think so. You're using my computer. I got a ton of work to do today. Right. Hmm. Well, let's see; you are the campaign manager, right? You know that I am. And you schedule things for Nicholas. Yeah. That's part of my job. Well, perfect. Then you can just schedule yourself something to do, because I'm busy. Thank you. [Sighs] Thanks. Nicholas. Francis is at my desk, using my computer. Is there something I need to know? Oh, damn, I'm sorry, Teresa. I should have told you. Should have told me what? Francis will be working in the office with us. You're kidding, right? You made this decision and thought, what? I didn't need to be part of the process? Teresa, I'm sorry. I really should have said something. Damn straight you should have said something! What is her job going to be? Or is that none of my business either? Alright now just calm down. It's no big deal. She's just gonna help out with the accounts. What? Actually it's perfect. It's what Francis does. Look, when she married me, she gave up her job. She really misses it. So you gave her mine. No. Of course not. Look, with those accounts off your plate, you'll have more time to be creative with the campaign. So you didn't just give her my job? Teresa, you and I go back a long way. I'd never do anything like that. Just give it a shot. I'd like to give her a shot. All right. Now you're being childish. You don't even know that woman. That woman happens to be my wife. I expect you to treat her with respect. Have you met her mother, father, a brother, sister? She have any allergies? She ever been arrested? What's her favorite food? You know nothing about her... nothing! Teresa, why don't you just grow the hell up! All right. Teresa. [Bell dings] [Footsteps] Honey, what's wrong? Hmm. I just had a little run-in with Teresa. Oh, no. Wow. She's having a tough time adjusting. You and me, and now the job. I don't think she's used to sharing you. I know. I just don't know what to do about it. Maybe we could have her over for dinner. Does she have a boyfriend? I'm sorry to interrupt. Lost my keys. Oh, no. I'm glad you're here, Terry. We were just talking about you. We would love you to come over to dinner. Maybe you could bring a friend. Like I've told you numerous times, my name is Teresa, not Terry. Thanks for the invite, but I think I'm gonna be too busy being creative. Did you, uh, move my keys? Sometimes you put them in your bag. Nicholas, I am trying, but my god, she is not making it easy. It's OK. Just give her some time. I'm sure she'll come around. What if she doesn't? I mean, she hates me. I'll talk to her. Promise? I promise. OK. Teresa: Thanks. [Door closes] Nicholas. What is it, Teresa? Can I talk to you for a minute? I'm in a hurry. Please. All right, but make it quick. I don't like what's happening between us. Things are spiraling out of control. You need to take some responsibility for this. OK. I know, and I am sorry... Why would you send my stuff back to my apartment? What? I didn't... It must have been Francis. She's been reorganizing everything. She probably just assumed, with everything that's happened... So she just did that on her own. Don't go there. She's taking over your life, and she is pushing me and everyone else out. You're crazy. No, Nicholas, I am not. You knowme. It's her! Nicholas, open your eyes! It is her! [Briefcase shuts] You leave me no choice, Teresa. You're fired. I'll pay you a year's salary, and that's it. Keep your money. I don't want your damn money. Then what do you want? I want our friendship back. It's over. It's over. Teresa: Wow. She travels a lot. Nicholas: Yes, she does. Have your met her mother, father, a brother, a sister? Look, pal, I don't know any Monica. Daniel: Then why is your number in her phone? Teresa: Nicholas, you don't even know that woman. Honey, have you seen my day calendar? Um... I think it's in the living room. Thank you. Teresa: It's her! Nicholas, open your eyes! It is her! Francis: Honey, did you find it? Right where I left it. Oh, that's good. Great. I was thinking of taking a bath. Would you like to join me? That sounds like fun. I can guarantee you it's gonna be fun. Let me grab us a bottle of wine. I'll be just a minute. That is an excellent idea. OK. Don't be late. I'll be waiting. I won't. [Water running] Her name is Francis Sweete, S-w-e-e-t-e. She would have graduated in '95 or '96. That's right, Sweete, with an "e" on the end. Maybe she dropped out? You're sure? Thank you. Hi. Hi. Why aren't you sleeping? Too much caffeine. Oh... Well, if you want to read or something, the light won't bother me. No. That's all right. OK. Love you. Did you bring a warm coat with you? Because it can get pretty cold in New Jersey this time of year. I have everything I need. Don't you worry. OK. I'll miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. Love you. Mmm! [Engine starts] Call me when you get in, OK? I will do that. OK. Bye-bye. Nicholas: Yes. Flight number 53 to New Jersey. I want to change it to Seattle. That's right. I said I want to go to Seattle. All right. Thank you. Anything at all... her birth, a graduation, a marriage, maybe. Are you spelling it correctly? Yes. She's my wife. And that's her full name? Look, her driver's license says Francis Sweete. There's got to be something. [Computer beeps] Well, I've got good news, and I got bad news. The bad news is, this is not Francis Sweete. The good news is, I recognize her. I do know who she is... Elizabeth Stone. What? You heard me. She was in the papers half a dozen times last year. Tragic. Her husband died just after they were married. You're absolutely positive that this is her? Yes, I am. I can see she changed her hair. Looks better this way. Suits her. But it's her, all right. What can you tell me about her husband? Lots of money. Owned his own helicopter company. Those two were pretty big on the social scene. Those articles she's in... could you copy those for me? Sure. Want a copy of her husband's obituary, too? Please. Sounds like she's been messing with you. Some women are just born trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, may I remind you, this is one of the finest French red burgundies to come to this auction house... one dozen bottles of Chateau Eblier 1978. Who will start the bidding at $9,000? 9,000. Thank you, Sir. 9,500. $10,000. 10,500. $11,000. 10,500, then, going once. 10,500 going twice. Let's make it an even 15,000. Auctioneer: $15,000. Your bid, Sir, at 15,500. All done. No more? Anyone else? $15,000, then, going once. I give fair warning. $15,000 going twice. Sold, to the young lady at the back, bidder number 19. We're now accepting bids for our rarest item, a bottle of this estate's oldest scotch. Nicholas: I have photos here, Detective... the same woman with different names. OK. Your wife is a dead ringer. My wife and Elizabeth Stone are the same person. [Sighs] You watch a lot of TV, Mr. Landon? And your point is what? It's pretty far-fetched. Look, the report says the accident was caused by mechanical failure. What was it, exactly? Damaged brake line. Apparently, this guy Stone drove his SUV pretty hard. And his wife was the last one to see him alive? Look, we're kind of busy around here. Now, unless you show me something concrete that can prove that these two women are one and the same person... show me something, anything. Detective, Detective, what if she takes on different identities? What if she killed Allan Stone? OK. I'll give you my advice. Go home. Sit down with your wife. Talk this out. Maybe see a marriage counselor. I could be next. Look, you show me a crime, I can help you. Otherwise... Man: Mr. Landon, how can I help? Mr. Silver, thank you for seeing me. I need to ask you a few questions about your partner, Allan Stone. Yeah? I want to show you this. And this. Allan's wife has two identities. [Scoffs] What you're suggesting is impossible. Elizabeth Stone is in Indonesia. She's doing charity work. Look at the pictures. It's the same woman. When I first met Elizabeth, I thought she was after his money. She was young, beautiful. He fell for her fast and hard. [Sighs] I had to trust his judgment, though. I mean, he was so smart about so many things. What can you tell me about Allan's death? Not much. Police said it was an accident, damaged brake line. Something about that didn't ring true, though. Why is that, exactly? Well, he loved his cars. If anything went wrong with them or felt wrong, he just got it fixed immediately. He treated those cars like they were his kids. I need to see Allan's financial records, if you can. Why? If Francis left any kind of trail, it's gonna be a money trail. I can't do that. I'm trying to find out if this was an accident or a murder. You're asking me to reveal personal, confidential financial information. If Allan were here right now, what would he do? What would he do for you? [Computer beeps] Allan's financial records. You have 30 minutes. It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Landon. I hear your husband's campaign will be starting soon. Yes, very soon. We're both extremely excited. On the phone, you mentioned transferring the campaign fund into a new account. Yes, I did. I hope that won't be a problem. Senora Apartments. Excuse me. I'm looking for this woman. Have you seen her before? Uh-uh. You're sure? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Hi. I'd like to talk with the manager. That's me. Sorry. There's no vacancies. I'm not looking to rent an apartment. No solicitors, either. Ma'am, excuse me, please. I'm trying to locate this woman. Do you know her? Even if she was a tenant, I couldn't tell you. We get a lot of weirdoes around here. Why are you looking for her? She's an old friend of mine. Then why don't you phone her? Listen, we lost touch. I just want to know if she's living here. Please. Yeah, OK. She lives here, but she comes and goes. She's not here right now. I haven't seen her in a couple of weeks. OK. I appreciate your help. Excuse me. Oh! I just have one more question. Does she happen to drive a car? Two... a fancy convertible and a pickup. The pickup's right over there. I really got to get back. Thank you. [Telephone rings] Hello. Teresa, it's Nicholas. Francis is gonna try and kill me. Nicholas, what are you talking about? Look, she murders her husbands for the money. That's crazy. No, it's not! Believe me. Look, she's done it before, and I'm next, Teresa. Look, I know she's a gold-digger and a bitch with a capital "B," but a murderer? Nicholas, listen to yourself. Listen, I'm not imagining this, Teresa. Believe me, I wish I was. Then go to the police. I did. I don't have enough proof. I need your help. You fired me, remember? Teresa, please. Where are you? I'm in Seattle. All right. What can I do? I've got the VIN number off her pickup. She drives a pickup? Yes, she drives a pickup. I know you can trace that number. That's illegal. This could ruin your political career. I have no other choice. All right. So, what's the number? It's 55A409090. It's registered to a Mrs. M. Nash. It's not Francis. Did you pull up the photo? Why would I? Teresa, please just... just do it. Oh, my god. It's Francis. But the name is Monica Nash. Nash. I know that name. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna see what I can find on Nash. Maybe she had another husband. Just be careful. I will. I'm gonna fly back tomorrow morning. I'll see you in a few hours. Teresa, thank you. [Sighs] [Keys jingle] What exactly do you think you're doing? It's a violation of your rental agreement to change the lock on your door without first advising me. Leave the lock alone. If there's a water leak, I need to get into your apartment. I can't do that if you change the lock. OK. I will cut you a key. Just give me a few days. Two days. Then I change it myself. Fine. Oh, by the way, one of your admirers dropped by earlier today. Who? Some guy. He was real interested in talking to you. Could you at least tell me what he looked like? You know, his face is just a blank to me right now. [Lock turns] Look at my phone records. Daniel Nash called me the week before I married her. He was furious. He said he was gonna rip my heart out if I didn't stay away from his wife, and at first, I just thought the guy was nuts, but then I checked him out. Look at this. He died the day he called me, Teresa. That's one hell of a coincidence, don't you think? And she married Daniel Nash 4 months before Allan Stone died. Stone didn't die until April. So she marries the new husband while she's still married to the old one, which means when she finds a new husband, she'll try and kill you. How do I know she hasn't found him already? [Sighs] We have to get our hands on her laptop. I can do that. What the hell is going on around here? This place is a pigsty. Oh, for god's sake! Yes. Those papers should be coming through right now. OK. Yeah, I got it. All right. I'll take a look at this and see if we've got a case. Please, Detective, move quickly on this. We're dealing with a murder here, or murders. All right, listen. Don't do anything foolish. I'm gonna be talking to the Redding detective division, so I'll be in touch with you. Thank you. Thank you for everything. What did he say? He said he's on it. Teresa... I don't know what to say. Try "thank you" and "I'm sorry," and, "Will you please come back to work for me?" I am so sorry for everything I put you through. You didn't deserve it, none of it. And yes, please come back to work for me. I want a raise. You got it. What now? I go back to the house and act like there's nothing wrong. Be careful. I will. [Sighs] Francis: Honey, is that you? Hi! I didn't expect you back till tomorrow. This is such a nice surprise. Mm! God, I'm so glad to see you. You look tired. How was your trip? It was long... long, tiring trip, but it's nice to be home. I'm so glad you are. I am gonna make you a drink. You go and sit, and I will be right in. OK. OK? Be right out. Here you go. So, how was New Jersey? It was nice. Um... We should vacation there sometime... rent a beach house, do some sailing. I would really like that. You know what? That reminds me of something. I'll be right back. It's just a little something to show my husband what he means to me. You really didn't have to get me anything. Oh, I know. I wanted to. I hope you like it. It's two cigars for us to smoke when you're elected. Believe it or not, I've never smoked a cigar before. Well, that's perfect. We can start a new tradition together. "To everlasting love." [Zipper unzips] [Laptop beeps] [Keyboard clicking] Nicholas? [Keyboard clicking] [Beep] Hi. Hey. What are you doing up? Couldn't sleep again? No. I thought I'd come down and get myself a glass of milk. Oh, that sounds good. Get one for me, too? Sure. OK. You know what? I think we should forget the milk. Are you sure? Maybe we should just go back to bed. Francis. Francis... You were hungry. Tell me about. I was worried she was gonna slip something into my food. Well, poison hasn't been her modus operandi so far. Yeah, that we know of. How did you get out of the house so early? I told her I had a breakfast meeting. It wasn't exactly a lie, was it? She's zeroing in on someone in Westchester. It says that there's a picture attached. Can you bring that up, as well? "Millionaire tycoon takes a bride." It's her. Wait a second. What is it? It's the 15th today. The Wasserman campaign donation goes through first thing this morning. She could be after the money. Nicholas, what can I do for you? Is there a transfer from my campaign account scheduled for later today? Yes. Mrs. Landon arranged for a transfer of one million dollars to a new account. I want to stop it, Richard. But you gave her signing authority on that account. Yes, I know I did, but I'm revoking that authority. I'm sorry, Sir. You can't do that over the phone. All right. I'm coming down. I'll be there in 15 minutes. [Telephone hangs up] Call Detective Nabor. The only way Francis gets away with this is if she kills me today. Detective, what should I tell the staff about the undercover officers? I'll talk to each one of them individually. Will I be present? Of course. We don't want to alarm anyone, but if she comes into the bank, we got to be on our toes. [Telephone rings] Excuse me. I left instructions not to be disturbed. Put her on line 3. It's Mrs. Landon. Put her on speaker. Act normal. Good morning, Mrs. Landon. How can I help you? Richard, why aren't the funds in that account? I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon. You no longer have signing authority over the campaign account. Excuse me? If you'd like to schedule an appointment, we can discuss the details. I'd like to discuss it now. I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon. You would have to do that in person and with your husband present. What do we do now? We send a car over to pick her up. Otherwise, go about your day, business as usual. If she attempts to contact you, call. Right away. Try not to engage her. Keep it to simple chitchat. Until she's in custody, I want 24-hour protection for myself and Teresa. We're on it. Richard, thank you for everything you've done. Richard: OK. Detective: Not yet. Go. Call in the CSI team. I think we have a serial killer on our hands. There may be as many as 4 victims, maybe more. She's been doing this for years. What about Farhed? Well, he's been briefed. As you can imagine, he's not a happy man. Detective, what drives a woman like this? Is it greed? I mean, she inherited the first time. Why keep it up? Killing someone for money is one thing; multiple murder is entirely something else. Her psychosis is so refined, she'd probably give Freud a run for his money. What are the chances of catching her? Slim for now. We suspect she's already moved on... new identity, new state... but she does make mistakes. She'll surface again. OK. I posted an officer outside your house... unmarked car, civilian clothes. Try not to worry, Mr. Landon. Thank you, Detective, for everything. Thank you, Sir. That was some smart detective work on your end. She's out there. They'll find her. I'm scared. Teresa, it's gonna be OK. There's an extra bedroom upstairs. Why don't you stay the night? Hey. I thought you went to bed. I did. Couldn't sleep. What are you still doing up? Couldn't sleep either. I know there's an officer out there, but it's only one person. Got any herbal tea in that big kitchen of yours? Yeah, somewhere. Want some? Sure. Thanks. OK. [Knob clicking] [Gas hissing] [Starts whistling] [Thump] [Whistling gets louder] Teresa. Teresa. Uh! Francis! Francis... [Whistling stops] Teresa. Oh, hey, Nicholas. Sorry about that. I really wanted you to sleep through your murder, but I had to split the dosage. I work much better when I'm not rushed. I told you she didn't like me. I told you that from the start. She sure did like you, though, stupid woman. [Cell phone dialing] Francis, please. Please what? Don't kill me? [Beep] Look, you're just like all the rest of them. I have no sympathy for you. If it's the money... It's not about money. I mean, I've got plenty of money. I didn't mind the sex so much, especially when you let some of the anger come into it. That was pretty good. Then what? What do you want? Do you think I'm beautiful? Yes. Well, my mother was beautiful, too. What is it about beautiful women? We always attract the wrong men. My mother was married 3 times. Did you know that? Did you know that? No. Well, she was, and all three of them treated her like garbage, and after a while, she started to believe that she wasgarbage, and not long after that, she started to stink like garbage. And that's how she ended up. She was just a big beautiful heap of stinking garbage. When I was 10 years old, she killed herself. Boom. I'm sorry. Francis, I loved you. I'd never hurt you. I hate you, Nicholas, and I hate everything you stand for, and I hate stupid women like that who think that love makes everything just great. Uh! Come on! [Gunshots] Police! Teresa, go! [People talking indistinctly] Hey, you. Hey. Guess who made the front page. That's not bad. Not bad? It's great. Yeah, but they forgot to mention the maestro working her campaign magic. Not my style. Besides, I don't need the press. How about a vacation? That, we both need. Come on. Let's go celebrate. Teresa: So, vacation, huh? Nicholas: Yeah. You get to decide. Hawaii. Hawaii? Yeah.
