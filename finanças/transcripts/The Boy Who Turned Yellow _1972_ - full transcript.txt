- What's in the box? - Want to see? Got another apple? - Aaah! What's his name? - Her name is Alice. Our next school outing will be a visit to the Tower of London. Date: Thursday March the 23rd. Starting point: The school. Tower of London! How about it, Alice? Does she eat grass? - Don't be silly. She eats mouse food. - Hang on a minute. Come on, I want to see the Crown Jewels! "Site of scaffold." That's where they cut off their heads! You know, they used to make pets out of the mice. In the dungeons. Bloody Tower! My feet are killing me. I never knew... Hey, look at this! Now, does anyone know the legend of the Tower ravens? - Ah! Munro? - If the tower loses its ravens, it will fall. Right. Hey, look at this! Come along, you two, hurry up. - I've lost Alice! - Where? Hold it! Eighteen, nineteen... Come on, Munro. What are you waiting for? - Twenty. There's somebody missing. - John Saunders, sir. - Run back, Munro, and see if you can find him. - Yes, sir. Those days were so romantic. Yeah, but imagine getting Henry into that for the Battle of Agincourt. Alice? Alice? He's asking for you. - Tell him you couldn't find me. - He'll only start looking for you. Teacher can't go home with one of his boys missing. And I can't go home with Alice missing. Why not tell him the truth? You know that's never any good. Let's consider the facts. Point one. Teacher brought twenty-one boys. - Can't leave with twenty, right? - Mmm. Point two. You can't tell him you've lost Alice, right? - Mmm. - So the logical thing to do is leave with us now, and come back later, right? Nnn-nnn. They close at five. Come back tomorrow, then. After school. - Tomorrow? - Alice will be here. She can't get out. Nobody can get out of the Tower. Sir Thomas More couldn't. Neither could Anne Boleyn. Nor could Lady Jane Grey. Now this is Lady Jane's bedroom, everyone. This is where she spent her last night. That's the dress that she wore. Finest Venetian brocade. Finest Venetian brocade. She wore all her jewellery. These rings, those bracelets. Now don't touch, please, Madam. And her hair, it was tied up with this silk scarf. Ere! Where's Lady Jane's scarf gone? We use electricity everywhere. It works for us in the form of a vacuum cleaner. It provides hot water for us. It lights our homes. Our streets. Anything else? Dingle? - No, sir. - Think, Dingle. Where does your mother cook your meals? On the cooker. There you are. We've got gas. Don't be difficult, Dingle. Can anyone else mention any other electric appliances? Come on! - Radio. - Good. - Telephone. - Go on. - House telephone. - One kind of telephone's enough. - Carter? - Electric guitar. Now, do you know what I've drawn here? Nobody? Not even you, Munro? The waves of electricity. Correct. Electricity moves in this kind of wavy pattern. I'll see if I can show you on the oscilloscope. There, you see? Its speed is very fast. Very, very fast. Its speed is equal to the speed of light. Who knows what the speed of light is? - Munro? - 186,000 miles in a second. Correct. Now, you can sit down, Munro. Make a note of it. One hundred... and eighty-six... thousand... miles... a second. Now, I'll show you a few of my own electric appliances, and you call out their names. Right? - What's this? - The kettle. - What sort of kettle? - Electric. - And this? - A vacuum cleaner. Now, who knows this one? - A transformer. - Very good, Munro. Now, not much difficulty about this! TV! Now... Now, I want you all to listen very carefully. In what way is this television set different from all the rest of these electric appliances? Nobody? Not even you, Munro? Is it that it gives us entertainment? True. But what else, Munro? I mean, in an electric sense? Think, Munro. The signals which produce the picture on the screen travel without the means of a solid conductor, like wires. All the others need wires, cables, et cetera. Exactly. Now, who can tell me what we call a conductor? - A conductor... - Not you, Munro. That wide-awake boy, John Saunders. Yes, sir? The question was, what is a conductor? Um... a conductor is... a bandleader? John Saunders, what did I tell you I would do if I caught you napping again? Send me home, sir. - Lost your voice? - Send me home, sir! To do what? Go to bed. What's got into you? What were you doing last night? Nightclubbing? No, sir. Worrying. - What about? - Alice. - Who's Alice? - My white mouse, sir. I've lost her. Got a cat in the house? No, sir. A dog. But that wasn't why she was lost. Where, then? In the Tower, sir. The Tower of London. You mean to say you bring white mice on a school outing? Just one mouse, sir. Get your things and go. What time does your father come home? Six o'clock, sir. Did you know about this, Munro? Yes, sir. You see, sir, John has two white mice. Alice and Father Christmas. Alice is expecting babies, and Mrs Saunders said she'd drown them all. So? John was carrying Alice with him all last week, just in case. - He brought her here? - Yes, sir. - In his pocket? - In a box, sir. And during the school outing, somehow she got out. In the Tower of London! A place rich in history. Where the Crown Jewels are guarded. Do you mean to say John Saunders' white mouse is now roaming round the Bloody Tower? Goodbye, sir. Eeurgh! What's he up to? That yellow boy. Jumped in a pot of paint. Sorry. Sweep! Sweep! - Hello, John. What's your... - Hello, Mrs Brown. - Hello, Mrs Price. - John! - Would you stop that dog barking? - Mother... John! What's the matter with you? - Are you ill? - No, Mum. Just yellow. Well, what sort of mischief have you got into? - I don't know. - Your father will be very cross. - Now let me see. - Ow! Look at you. You've got it all over you. Did you fall into a barrel of yellow paint? - No, I didn't! - Did somebody push you? No, it happened on a... What is it? You're bleeding yellow. Now, it didn't hurt. Now, do you mind if I... I snip a bit off one of your nails? Now, give me your hand. Yes, I've seen yellow nails before. Cigarette smokers have 'em. Nicotine. Do you smoke, John? Yes, I'd call that dirty yellow. Well, Mrs Saunders, I can't see anything wrong with him. His heart, lungs, sight, reflexes, all fine. Oh! My husband. We're in John's den, Ted! Dr Ward's with us. I've never seen anything like it. You'll make medical history, my lad. - May I get up now? - Yes. - No! - Oh, please. I must feed Father Christmas. - Father who? - Couldn't he have got it from his mice, Dr Ward? I've only got one mouse, Mother. - Hello, Doc. - Evening. Now, let's have a look at you. Well, he's a picture of health, your son. A rather discoloured picture. But unique. Except for the girl in the train, Dad. There was a girl. In the Tube. She turned yellow too. Well, up to 4pm, 68 people are reported to have turned yellow. May I have a look? "Yellow plague hits London." Wow! - How does it feel, John? - Fine. May I get up now? Dr Ward says I may. Even the traffic lights. Oh, there's a diversion at Haverstock Hill. What's it mean, Ted? Nobody knows. Is there anything we ought to do, Doc? We'll have to wait and see. The Ministry of Health will probably issue some instructions. I see there's to be a television programme on it tonight. May I stay up and watch it, Dad? No, darling, it's better for you to rest. I'm not tired! We have this evening three experts on scientific matters... Excuse me. Thank you. I've just heard that the number of people affected by this extraordinary business has reached 406. - 407, counting me. - Nothing to be cocky about. They are all well, and appear to have no ill effects from this extraordinary happening. Now, I've asked our cartographer to point on the map... Car-what? - Cartographer. - Map-maker. As you see, all these dots happen to be inside a circle. You see a yellow circle of about 310 yards' radius. I shall ask now some of our experts for a few observations. I'm told we've got pictures of some oddities. People and objects from the perimeter of this circle. - Mum? - A perimeter is the outline of the circle. Isn't it, Ted? Look, he's pointing it out. - I'm hungry. - Oh, you can't be, John. You've had your dinner, and you've gobbled up all the cheese biscuits! Oh! For heaven's sake, what have you got there? - Only Father Christmas. - Ted? He's so lonely without his wife. Get him to put that mouse back in its box. Do what Mummy says, John. You'd be lonely without Mum, wouldn't you? Don't argue, John. Okay. A rather strange way of expressing them. In Hampstead, and I can say this because I come from Hampstead myself... I won't be long. Here, have some cheese straw crumbs. You love cheese straw crumbs. You know you do. There. Now, go to sleep. Good night. It's a singularly unlikely event that you could have pigmentation taking place in an area 600 yards in diameter, 120 feet below the surface of the Earth. In the light of the supernatural quality of, er... these fantastic happenings, I would submit the only thing we can think of is the most impossible cause of all. Namely, it's an extra-terrestrial event. Extra what? Dad? What is Terra? Earth. Extra? Extra is extra. Well, it can mean "outside of". So "extra-terrestrial" is "outside of our Earth". Well, what is the purpose, Dr House? - Space? - Listen. - A target, perhaps. - A target for what? A landing site, perhaps. Gosh, I hope no-one's going to land on top of me. Mr Saunders? Mr John Saunders? I'm starving, Mr Saunders. Did you call, Father Christmas? Hurry up, Mr Saunders. I can't wait all night. Mr Saunders. Hurry up, Mr Saunders. I can't wait all night. Mr John Saunders? I'm starving, Mr Saunders. Mr Saunders? Is anybody there? Don't ask silly questions, Mr Saunders. I'm starving. Where are you? I can't see you. In the television, of course. I'm starving. - Behind it? - In the set, man. Inside of it! Well, what are you waiting for? Do you want me to starve to death? Switch it on! Dad says I'm not supposed to touch the television. - It's dangerous. - Turn that knob. Then press the second button. Good boy. Gosh! I'm sorry, Mr Saunders. I've been travelling all night. The name is Nick. Comes from electronic. I apologise for repeating myself. I'm absolutely famished. My supplies are almost exhausted. Would a drumstick do? - What stick? - A drumstick. You know, a leg of chicken. Mr Saunders, we're not cannibals! Veget... ta... tarians? Not vegetarians, either, Mr Saunders. We live on electricity. What's your voltage in London? I'm afraid I don't know. Oh good! 240 volts! That's my favourite dish! - May I? - Be my guest. Don't do that! You'll get a shock. You will get a shock. I shall get my... drumstick. Oh, it's marvellous. I must find out where they make it. Where's your nearest power station, Mr Saunders? Call me John. John. It's delicious. I've never tasted better. I don't know where they make it. You'd have to ask Munro that. Who's Munro? He knows all about electricity. He knows almost everything. Is he yellow? What do you mean? Well, you're yellow. That makes you a friend of mine. We're united under the same colour, as the saying goes. Is he? I don't know. I wasn't with him at the time. Well, we can find a power station without Munro. I've got a nose for it. Ah! That's better. - Why not come with me? - They'll miss me. No-one will miss you. No-one will even know. It'll only take a moment. We shall be travelling by electricity very fast. The speed of light? Very good. Except... forgive me for correcting you, Mr, er, John. We don't say "Electricity travels with the speed of light," we say "Light travels with the speed of electricity." Get it? What's the difference? I like your way of talking American, John. - Who's talking American? - Aren't you? I'm talking English. Though Americans speak English. What's the difference? Sorry, John. Anyway, the thing is, we'll be travelling fast. 186,000 miles in a second. I say! Well, I'm quite full. Well, are you coming? How? Up and down on the waves of electricity, like skiing. I'm no good at skiing. I fall all over the place. You won't if you hold my hand. You won't even need skis. Float. You're joking. I haven't time to make jokes. All yellow people can float. I can! I can! Now, you see that television screen? It flickers, doesn't it? You'll see it better if you turn your head sideways. Now you can slip inside between two flickers. Try it. Isn't it dangerous? It would be if I weren't with you. You must never do it on your own. - Promise. - Okay. - Off you go. - I... I'll break the glass. Now you're being plain silly, John. You're diving into an electric current, not into glass. You won't even touch the glass. Now, one, two, three, go! I'm doing it! I'm coming! Here we are. Generating plant. - You call it a power station. - Already? You stay here while I look around. - Can't he see us? - No. He can't hear us either! Once outside the screen, he could see and hear you. Not me, though. Well, ? tout ? l'heure. - That's French for "see you soon". - I know. How come? Well, we went to France. Fantastic food. What voltage? Something I like called omelettes. They're yellow. - Fish omelettes. - Electric fish? - I don't think so. Normal. - Oh. Well, you stay here, and don't fall out. Ridiculous. Very old-fashioned. Stabilise the generators! Throw the switches! I'm sorry, John. It's no good. The quality is fine, it's the quantity that's wrong. Pardon? There isn't enough. We need a great deal of the stuff. I don't know how you people manage. Don't you have electricity cuts? In the winter, or when we have a strike. - Oh. Well, shall we go? - Where to? Home. Your home. Unless there's somewhere else you'd rather go. - Can we? - Anywhere. - To the Tower. - What kind of tower? The Tower of London. It's a castle, really. It's where the Crown Jewels are kept. It's very old. Has it got electricity? I think so. In some parts. Oh. Doesn't sound like my cup of kilowatts. Couldn't we go somewhere else instead? No, I must go there. I must find Alice. Alice? Oh, all right. - Can we take Father Christmas? - Who's he? - Her husband. - Is he yellow? No, he's white. He's a mouse. Oh, well, that's different. Why didn't you say so? - Where do we pick him up? - My house. All right then, let's get along. Come on! Hang on! Haverstock Hill! Phew! - We forgot to switch it off! - We did not. - If anybody had switched it... - Ssssh! You'll wake up my mother. She can't hear me either! If anyone had switched it off, you wouldn't have got through the screen. Or come back. My mother's a very light sleeper. She can't hear me. Only yellow people can. Oh. Can you get up the stairs in those? I can, but I don't think I will. Help me with them, John. Pleasure. Follow me. Nice room. I liked it the first time I saw it. - You've been here before? - Oh, yes. - When? - When I landed. I had to check on all the people who'd turned yellow. That's the rule. - Whatever for? - To find a chap we could trust. - Me? - Undoubtedly. How did you find out? Easy. The others were just people who turned yellow. But you, you've got a yellow pullover, and a yellow scarf, and a terrific yellow... something. My top hat. I'm a supporter of Norwich City. - Who's he? - Norwich City. The football club. The Canaries. They're the only club in England to play in yellow. I've got a badge. Oh, and look at those pictures on the wall. Nick, meet Father Christmas. Father Christmas, meet Nick. A pleasure! The Tower's a very big place, and Father Christmas can help us to find his wife. But, John, with my speed I can scour around that tower of yours in a flash. No offence intended, Father. So long as they have electricity laid on. How will you know where to find her? She's obviously going to be hiding somewhere. In a bed. Behind a bookcase. Or even in a wall. I know Alice. - But your Poppa Christmas... - Father Christmas. Oh, of course, Father Christmas. Sorry, Dad! But John, a mouse can't even open a door. Then we open the door for him. All he has to do is to smell the scent of his wife, and lead us to her. I see! What a good idea. You're improving! Hold these a minute. - Now, where's this tower of yours? - The Tower. You know, Tower Bridge. There's a Tower Hill Tube station. On the Circle Line. Ah, I've got it! Care to have a go? - May I? - Why not? Football! Offside! Cheat! - This isn't the Tower! - We're in the Tower! Now, can you see beyond the football game, and beyond the screen of the television? Mmm. There are people watching the football game. Four of them. In sort of a uniform. Eating beef. Beefeaters! Good! Then we are in the Tower. I must get rid of them. You don't want to be seen by them. How will we get through this? Same as through an empty screen. But you mustn't stop. Not for a single second. Now, I'll go ahead and get rid of the Beefeaters. You count down from five, and then slip outside. I'll be waiting. Go! Five... four... three... Hey! Penalty! Hey, you! Get out! Ref, get this boy off the pitch! Stay put, John! Foul! Don't worry, John! I'll throw the switches. Hey, Ref, I've got a mouse in my pants! - Father Christmas? Where are you? - Is that you, John? I've lost Father Christmas! Here, I've got him. Thanks. Come on. This is more tricky than I thought. My fault. I shouldn't have left you. But I've fixed those Beefeaters. - What did you do about them? - Set the alarm. Now, we just wait for it to go off. All right, then? I keep on hearing things, Ref. What things? "Father Christmas, Father Christmas." Goal! Butterfingers! Alarm! Could have waited till after the game. I'll switch off the set. No time for that now. Geoff's right. - We'd better do a general tidy up. - Yeah, okay. - Don't forget the telly! - Yeah, okay. All at the double! Halt! Hey, Mr Beefeater. My friend needs that set switched on. He can't hear me. Can't see me, either. That's funny. - Yes, isn't it? - Try some oil. Steady, old man. It's gone stiff. All's well, sir! Now, let's see what that Daddy Christmas of yours can do. Father Christmas. Alice is here, Father Christmas. In this building. Find Alice, Father Christmas. Where is she? Hmm? That way? Alice can't be that way. - Why not? - She can't be in the wall. Nor can she be in the window. Mice make holes in walls, you know. I've seen them doing it. Come on. There. Changed his mind? Come on, Father Christmas. I know you can find Alice. Through the door? Up? Or... Down? Well? Make your mind up! Down! Come on, then. Guard, at the double! Halt! The guards! Quick, get inside the gun. Well, what now? We find another building. You still think he can do it? Of course he can. Well, he wasn't so sure a moment ago. First he went thisaway, then he went thataway, and look where we are now. He did that to show us that we were in the wrong building. What was that? Just some birds. Big black birds. The Tower ravens! It must be. - They're paid. - I don't believe it. - It's true. Fifteen pence. - An hour? - A week. - What are they expected to do for it? Nothing. Just stay there. Well, in that case it's just about right. They're very important. You see, if the Tower loses its ravens, it'll fall. Who says so? Everybody. It's in the book. Guard, at the double! March! Well, now. Are we going to try that bloodhound of yours again? Come on, let's show this Doubting Thomas where Alice is, Father Christmas. The name's Nick. Guard! Halt! Julius Caesar's Tower? All looks clear, sir! Come on! Guard, at the double! March! Here? He says she's here. Guard, halt! - Jewel Room? - All correct, sir! - Beauchamp Tower? - All is well, sir! Guard, at the double! March! Up? - Well, you have a look up the chimney. - You look under the bed. Right, I'll look under... - No, there's nobody under the bed. - Nothing up here. He says "up". There's somebody downstairs. I can hear them. 'Ere, they're coming up! - You get behind the door. - Yeah, all right, I'll get behind. Ere, you get the other side. If they come up the stairs, we've got 'em. - Okay. - They come in here, we've got 'em. Look! A mouse! A mouse! - There's a mouse! - Oh, no! A mouse an' all! Murder! Help! A mouse! Get out of it! Get out of it! Help! There's a mouse! Murder! Murder! Eeugh! Take it away! Get out of it! Get out of it! Help! Help! Murder! A mouse! Come on, there's something odd up here. Go ahead, Nick. I'll stay and defend the stairs. Attack me if you dare! All right, come on, son. It's no use trying to fight this. It's no use. Watch 'im! Well done, John! Keep him down there! Right, Nick, take them! Good, Nick! Come on! Keep it going! Now look, cut it out there, son. Go on, John! Good boy! I'm with you, John! Leave it to me! Don't panic, John. I've got you by the collar. Watch 'im! You silly little... Come on, that's the idea! It's no use, you know. Watch 'im! - He can't move. - Go on! Cut it out there, son. Well done, John. Leave him down there! Come on! Gotcha! You're hurting me! You're hurting me! Help me! Nick! Nick! Help me! Nick! Help me! Nick! Where are you? All quiet. Not a mouse stirring. - It's cold. - Yeah. Those ravens are making a noise tonight. Well, good night. It's Nick, John. Are you all right? - It's very dark in here. - No talking! Won't take long, John. I've got just the right thing in my bundle to get you out of here. Look! Sorry, can't hang on. If I could find something to stand on... Wait a minute! I've got my pencil torch. Quiet! Hello! How did you get here with no electricity? What's that thing in your hand? Oh. Well, what's the news? I was at your trial. It was very unfair. But don't get upset, John. I'll get you out of here. What's the sentence? - Beheading. - Hmm. Thought so. - Mum won't be very pleased. - I don't blame her. Nor Dad. My uncle's a solicitor. He'll sue them. Well, that won't help that much after. But they reckoned without Nick of Electronic, didn't they? Now, you told me that when the Tower loses its ravens, it will fall. - Well, see this bundle... - What's in it? The ravens! All of them! You see, how it works, I dump the ravens somewhere in Africa or the North Pole, the Tower falls to pieces, and you're free! Is something wrong? It's only a legend. And mind you put them back again. The Tower may fall, but it'll take ages. Maybe years. You think so? In the Tower, they execute people at dawn. I'll go and wake your father. I'll be there before you can say "Jack Beefeater". No-one can wake my father. Well, your mum, then. My mum will think it's just a dream and turn over. No offence, Nick, but you are a bit hard to believe. Well, you must have somebody. A clever friend? I've got it! - Who? - Munro. But he's not yellow. You told me so. But he's very clever. He'd be up about now, reading a book or something. Well, where will I find him? Regent's Park. Chestergate. Forgive me, Mr Munro. I have borrowed your machine to communicate with you. Where are you? Can't you talk? Unfortunately, only yellow people can see me or hear me. - I come from outer space. - Interesting. What can I do for you? Our mutual friend John Saunders is a prisoner in the Tower. How did he get in at this time of night? My fault, Mr Munro. I introduced him by means of an electric current. At what velocity? Via an ordinary television set. Why can't he get out the same way? He's under guard, until his execution. Execution? At dawn, Mr Munro. Hmm. If he can't get to a TV set, you'll have to get one to him. - How? - Easy. All you have to do is... You remembered everything? Yup. You don't want me to repeat the words? No, thanks. Prisoner, have you got anything to say? Yes, sir. Well, say it, then. I protest on two accounts. Not only am I innocent, but I have been denied my last wish. - Is this true, Executioner? - I am afraid so, sir. In the name of the government, and the people, and the executioner, I apologise. I accept your apology. Make a last wish, prisoner, and let's get on with it. My last wish is to watch television for the last time. So be it. Bring hither a television set, with a long enough lead that it can be plugged in inside. But it's far too early, my Lord. There's nothing on at dawn. Prisoner, you heard what the executioner said. Yes, sir, but I just want to switch it on all the same. Sounds silly to me, but it's your execution, not mine. Thank you. Switch on! Which particular channel, sir? It doesn't really matter. May I go closer, my Lord? Close as you like. I hope you like the programme, prisoner. The best programme I've ever seen! Fools! Knaves! Thanks, pal! Let's go, bud. I've already overstayed my time. Nick! Alice and Father Christmas! Where are they? - In there. - Both of them? Mm-hmm. One each. The signals which produce the picture on the screen travel without the means of a solid conductor, like wires. All the others need wires, cables, et cetera. Exactly. So long, John. Now, who can tell me what we call a conductor? - I hope we meet again. - Bye, Nick. I can't take this to school. All right, I'll take it home for you. Find it in your room. So long, John. Have a nice trip. Take... The question was, "What do we call a conductor?" Saunders. There are good conductors, and bad conductors, and semi-conductors. A good conductor allows us to transfer electricity from one body to another. - Did you hear that, Munro? - Yes, sir. You wouldn't know, by any chance, how electricity travels? In waves, sir. Like those on the board. Er... with what speed, Saunders? 186,000 miles in a second. Well, I said I'd send you home if I caught you napping again, but a boy who knows all about electricity... - And in his sleep! - Exactly, Munro! - Well, what do you think? - No! - Hello, John. - Hello, Mrs Brown. What's your hurry? - Hello, John. - Hello, Mrs Price. Oh! Oh! Hello, Sweep! Mum! I'm making tea, darling. Mum, has anybody left a box for me? What box? - Anything wrong, John? - Nothing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven! Eleven? There is something wrong. - Baby mice. - Eleven of them. - Oh! - I'll give them away. Munro wants a pair, and so does Gary, and that new Brazilian boy. Do they like sugar? SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
