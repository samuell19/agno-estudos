Tch. A mere Ogre mercenary dares to defy me? All these losses, just for one deserter? I may be no more than an Ogre mercenary, but I have a village and precious comrades I must protect. Stopping now is not an option! You mean those guys lying around there? Well? Oh? You gonna come at me? Whoa, there! What? Is that all you've got? You were more trouble than you're worth. We're outta here. Someone... Tell the village... What would you like to do? You mustn't move around yet. Your wounds have not yet healed. Where am I? And... who are you? I am the queen of the Kingdom of Raja. My name is Towa. Raja... Towa? We found you lying by a stream in the mountains and brought you here. You were in grave danger. Do you not remember? I see. It seems I am in your debt. There is no need for thanks... Hiiro. Hiiro? Save... him... Please... I grant you... the name "Hiiro." Your wounds were severe. We had no way to heal you. I could only hope giving you a name to evolve you would be enough. But... I lacked the life force to give names to all of you. My comrades... What happened to them? I thought that if I could just save you... Please forgive me for being so powerless. There's nothing you need to apologize for. Not when you went out of your way to care for them. I thank you. I understand now that you saved me. But as I am now... Do you intend to return to the Ogre Village? Huh? You spoke of it time and time again in your sleep. You were asleep... for ten whole days. Wait, Hiiro! Hey! Stop! H-Hey! I need to borrow this! I'm sorry! Come on, this way! Wait for us! Wait up! This way! Come on! Hey, hold up! This is... what was once such a beautiful village? I've lost the precious comrades left to me by the village chief, and now my homeland... Damned Orcs! Curse you all! Forgive me, my queen, but it's been four days. It seems unlikely he will return. Clearly, we misjudged him. He was just a ruffian with no concept of gratitude. No... Look! That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime The Scarlet Bond That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Find him?! No! We've failed! I can't even sense him! Where the heck did that old geezer go?! You called? Oh... ...noooo! You still rely too much on your sense of sight. You're right! Teach us again! The indomitable Sir Gabiru! So tough! Indeed! Ow... Hey, where's Geld? He's working. He seemed concerned about how the job was coming along. That should do it. Man, he's so serious. You'd best get serious about your training, as well. I've received word that Geld is under attack. No way! Enemies?! I'll go help him! We will go, as well! Right! I will inform Great Rimuru and our young master. I sent "Youm the champion" and Diablo out to restore peace in Falmuth... But was that the best idea? I hope they don't overdo it. Great Rimuru! It's unhealthy to push yourself too hard. Why don't you take a little break? Good idea. Thanks, Shuna. Let's take a breather. Of course. Here you go. For you, too, Shion. Thank you. I'll gladly have some. Ah, that's good. Very relaxing. Sure is peaceful. Yes. I hope it will stay like this for a good, long time. Well said. Oh, that's right! What's up, Shion? I baked some of those "cookies" that you taught me a recipe for! Please have them with your tea! Whoa! Our peace just got shattered! Go on, dig in! Guoooogh Guoooogh Guoooogh Go on, dig in! Guoooogh Guoooogh Guoooogh I-I forgot I was in the middle of my weaving. If you'll excuse me... She's running away! Hold it, Shuna! I'm sorry, Great Rimuru. A-An afterimage?! Come, now, Great Rimuru! Don't be shy! Guoooogh Come, now, Great Rimuru! Don't be shy! Go on! Eat up! Guoooogh Just because she has the skill Master Chef now... Guoooogh doesn't mean the food's appearance isn't important! Please enjoy them, Great Rimuru! Raphael-san! Got any hints for me?! Please enjoy them, Great Rimuru! Go on! Go on! Go on! Raphael-san! Got any hints for me?! No, I do not. Go on! Go on! Go on! Harsh... Go on, now! Eat up! Guoooogh H-Hang on, Shion! I'm sensing something in the direction of the forest! I should runâ€”I mean, go check it out! Huh? Great Rimuru. Geld is under attack in the forest. See? I was right! Off I go! Wait, he's under attack?! Damned Orc remnant! You're targeting Tempest now?! Are you a spy?! You bastard! That horn... I will avenge my village! Ogre Flame! Did you just say "avenge"? You're from the Ogre... I don't know who you are, but... Brother? It can't be... You're... Is that you, Brother? You're alive? Young master? Am I dreaming? How are you alive? The village was destroyed! Yes, but I survived. I was saved, and even given a name. I'm called Benimaru now. This is no dream. It's too good to be a dream! Me, too! Hiiro. That's my name. Hiiro... I see. You've been named, as well. Yes! Could there be a happier coincidence? How could you protect the Orc that destroyed our village? It's a long story, but we've reconciled. This is Geld. He's a valuable ally of ours here in Tempest. An ally? No. If you say it's true, then the Orcs are no longer our enemy. I sincerely apologize for my indiscretion. No, it is true that we destroyed the Ogre Village. That can never be forgiven, no matter how many times I apologize. Captain? What's going on? This man called Benimaru and I were friends as children in the Ogre Village. Brother? Impossible... Is it really you? All of you... And Master, too! Brother! Wow, you sure grew up! It's been too long. I can't believe you're alive. I see. So Hiiro-san is your childhood friend from the Ogre Village, huh? Yes. He was as an older brother to us. More like a ringleader, really. Well, it's easy to see that they all really adored you. "Adored," eh? We consider him our real brother. That broken horn is a wound he received protecting me. I see. So it's your badge of manhood! He also saved me when I was about to fall off of a cliff. He got into a lot of fights with Benimaru, too. Yeah. I always lost, though. Oh, come on. I lost sometimes, too. He was the strongest one in our village. That's why he left home to work as a mercenary. And I took ten others with me. But we weren't blessed with very good employers. Which country did you end up working for, anyway? Distave. Demon Lord Clayman's domain. I thought I'd be able to make some good money, but then I found out the Ogre Village was about to be attacked, so I deserted his army. But... Brother Hiiro... No, it's useless to think about it now. Right now, I should just be happy to see all of you again. This means my comrades didn't truly die in vain. That's right! The mere fact that you're alive is a win! When I was nearly dead after a battle, my life was saved by Queen Towa of the Kingdom of Raja. I serve her now. And she's the one who named you? Naming another is a risk to one's own life. It's not something that can just be done on a whim. Yeah. Raja is a very small kingdom that makes its living mining gold, but some time ago, they completely mined out a large gold vein, and it's now a mere shadow of the prosperous nation it once was. Yet even in such trying times, Queen Towa is giving of her own life force to keep her kingdom, her people, alive. Chikuan! How is the queen's condition? Not good. If she continues to use her magic to neutralize the toxins from the mines, the curse will take over her whole body, as it did with the queens who came before her. That tiara... The royal family has the ability to use the tiara's magic to neutralize the mine toxins in the lake, protecting the people from their poison. But... In exchange, the wearer absorbs the Curse Poison in the tiara? The queen wouldn't have lost so much of her life force if she hadn't named you. Oh, dear. My tongue slipped. Still, I've tried many medicines, and none worked on the Curse Poison. If we don't mine gold, we can't import enough food to feed our people. Yes, but we can't force the queen to risk her life further. What if we cultivate the Great Forest of Jura? That forest? We can be self-sufficient in food. The people can work the fields, and the soldiers and I can hunt. Don't be ridiculous! You're talking about violating a forest guarded by the Storm Dragon Veldora! You clearly aren't in your right mind! Hiiro, you might not know this since you once lived in the Great Forest of Jura, but there is an unspoken agreement among the surrounding nations that the forest is inviolable. Earning the wrath of Veldora would surely have disastrous consequences. Let a sleeping god lie, as they say! Are you saying you're fine with letting Queen Towa continue to suffer alone?! Is that what you call being "in your right mind"?! Now, calm down. We feel the same way you do. The previous generation entrusted us with the queen. We will protect her at any cost. That is the last job we old fools have been tasked with. Then... Urgent report! The army from Falmuth that has invaded the Great Forest of Jura engaged in battle with a nation called Tempest and was completely wiped out! Tempest? The nation that stopped the Orcs? Their military is that powerful? They also say the Storm Dragon Veldora was revived by feeding on the bodies of the dead Falmuth soldiers! This is exactly what I was talking about! Do you get it now? This is why the forest is inviolable! They got what they had coming. But the leader of Tempest, Rimuru, successfully negotiated with the newly revived Veldora to prevent all casualties outside Falmuth's army before they could happen. What?! Their leader, Rimuru? If we tell him what's going on, maybe he'll agree to the cultivation! They do say his nation accepts monsters of all types. True... I will serve as our messenger to Tempest. You won't object to that now, will you? Very well. Do be careful. We can't have you poking at a bush and flushing out a snake. I know that. It's a dragon I want to see. A snake won't do me any good. That's how I ended up here with these two, but then I raised my blade to Geld... no, to the people of Tempest without even thinking. I apologize. We're very sorry! Well, you had your reasons. Don't worry about it. Okay, I guess I should add some more to this info dump. More? I became a Demon Lord. Oops! Sorry! A D-Demon Lord? That's right! He defeated Clayman and earned the approval of the other Demon Lords! Aw, it wasn't that big a deal... He defeated Clayman and earned the approval of the other Demon Lords! He defeated... Clayman?! Great Rimuru was absolutely fantastic! I see... Anyway, you said you wanted permission to cultivate the forest? Hey, Veldora. Is entry into the forest really forbidden? Why? I dunno. You heard him. Vel... ...dora? Oh, I guess I forgot to introduce you. This is my friend, Veldora-kun. Go on, say hello. I am the Storm Dragon Veldora. As long as you don't make a lot of noise, you can enter the forest all you want. Great... Veldora? Uh, yeah, well... You've got permission now, so you don't need to worry about... I want in on this, too! Milim?! You're having a banquet today, right? Milim?! You're having a banquet today, right? Why didn't you tell me?! It's not a banquet. There's just a messenger here. I know it's a banquet! You're drinking! How could you not invite me?! That's so cold! Hey! I can't let this slide just 'cause we're besties! Right, Veldora?! What?! This is a banquet?! You didn't save any for me! I told you, we have a messenger visiting! Milim? That Milim? I told you, we have a messenger visiting! Nah, couldn't be... The banquet comes after! See?! It is a banquet! Nah, couldn't be... See?! It is a banquet! Rimuru! See?! It is a banquet! Come on, just calm down a little. Yes? I wish to make a formal request of the leader of the Jura Tempest Federation, Rimuru Tempest. If nothing is done, the Kingdom of Raja will fall. I want to save Queen Towa, who saved my life, and the citizens she treasures so deeply. I beg you, for the good of Raja, lend me your aid! Great Rimuru, I make the same request of you. Me, too. Hey, come on, you guys. Raise your heads. You don't have to beg. Of course I'll help. Towa-san seems to really care about her people, and I'd like to see this Kingdom of Raja. Is it okay if I visit her to wish her well in her recovery? Of course! Great Rimuru... Thank you. I thank you for your kindness. Be well, Master. I'll train you again sometime. Please go easy on me when you do. Come see us again soon. Yeah, I will. Okay, we're off to the Kingdom of Raja. Let's go! Take care! Safe travels! Take care! Bring us some cool stuff back! Take care! We await your return! Bring us some cool stuff back! Take care! Bring us some cool stuff back! We await your return! We await your return! It's within sight now. That's the Kingdom of Raja. It's such a beautiful country! Thank you! But it does have far less vitality than it used to... F-Forgive me. That was a good rumble. I had a feeling this might happen, so... Here! Wh-What happened? Ranga, follow them! This is our prime minister, Mobuji, and our minister. That is the leader of the Jura Tempest Federation, Rimuru Tempest. Goodness! We have little to offer in the way of hospitality, but allow me to welcome you on behalf of the Kingdom of Raja. Thank you for coming all this way. So... I heard that you were a monster... specifically, a slime... Oh... You mean this? Is it easier for you to talk to me in this form? P-Please forgive my indiscretion! I didn't realize you had assumed that form for our benefit! Please return to the way you were! Really? Yes! Okay. How is Queen Towa? She's sleeping. Chikuan is with her. Then I'll give my report here first. The Storm Dragon Veldora has granted us permission to cultivate the Great Forest of Jura. What?! You met him?! Rimuru introduced me to him. It's really not that big a deal. Just make sure you don't get too greedy. Yes, of course! Thank you so much! I'm sure everyone will be thrilled! But a large-scale cultivation effort will require the aid of specialists. It won't be eas... No need to worry about that! I know that voice. Wh-What's going on?! Oh, don't worry. It's okay. That's a friend of mine. Treyni-san? What are you doing here? Treyni? You mean... the Dryad?! I-It can't be! I never thought I would see you in all my days! We are so blessed! So blessed! I can now die happy. I feel like I'll live longer now. Hey! You two! You're not gonna tell me you can't see me, are you?! We're trying to enjoy the moment here! What?! You're making too much noise! What?! Can't you save this for later? Hey, Rimuru! Tell them who I am! U-Um, this is... She is our ruler, the Queen of Spirits, and a Demon Lord... The Great Ramiris! A D-Demon Lord?! That means I'm more important than Treyni! Got it?! Forgive us! The great Veldora, the great Treyni, and a Demon Lord... The leader Rimuru himself has been formally acknowledged as a Demon Lord, as well. Oh, my... I'd like to get straight to the point. I understand the dire situation Raja is in. Cultivation is important, but you should also be prepared to farm. Well said! I see! Yes, of course! Treyni-san really can show up anywhere. I see! Yes, of course! Let us first improve your waste collection to produce better fertilizer. Treyni-san really can show up anywhere. Well, I think we can safely leave the farming to her. Let us first improve your waste collection to produce better fertilizer. Ah! I will assemble workers at once! Well, I think we can safely leave the farming to her. Indeed. Ah! I will assemble workers at once! You can use the leaf mulch in the forest to... The queen has awakened. All right. Rimuru, please come and see Queen Towa. Sure. Queen Towa, I've brought the leader of the Jura Tempest Federation, Rimuru Tempest, to see you. Thank you for traveling so far. I'm sorry to greet you in this state. Rimuru might be able to treat you. I can't ask you to immediately trust a monster who just showed up out of nowhere, but... I trust you. Really? That easily? I have no reason to doubt anyone Hiiro has brought to me. Queen Towa... All right, then. Mind if I take a look at you? Are you curious? Y-Yeah. I've heard whoever wears that can use immense magic power. I definitely sense incredible power in it. You can tell? It's because I have this tiara that I can protect my nation and its people. But it afflicts you with Curse Poison in return? All things come with a price. Appraisal Answer. The tiara's Curse Poison cannot be removed. Only the one who placed the curse on it can remove it. However, so long as she does not use the tiara, she should gradually recover. I see. Depending on the user's life force, it's possible to resist the Curse Poison. But the recovery of her life force seems to be drastically delayed. Symptomatic treatment is recommended. Please administer honey as a restorative tonic. Honey Please administer honey as a restorative tonic. Administration Recommended Honey Please administer honey as a restorative tonic. It's delicious. It's special honey produced in Tempest. It's the best medicine there is. Try to have a spoonful after every meal. I can feel my body warming up from the inside. It's true... Her color already looks better. It works that quickly? The Curse Poison won't be easy to get rid of, but as long as she doesn't use the tiara, she'll get better. Really?! Yeah. Thank you so much. But if I don't use this power, the toxins from the mines will... I'll take care of that, too. Huh? Can I ask you to leave that to me? Hundreds of years of mining are causing toxins from the mines to pour into this lake. Right, Towa-san? Yes. The lake was once filled with pure, clean water, but now, it's a lake of death. Eventually, the poison will be so strong that the air around it becomes toxic. Great Rimuru, couldn't you remove all the toxins from the mines and restore the water in the lake to complete purity? Yeah. Really?! But... hang on a minute. When I arrived in this country... Notice. Notice Notice. The composition of this poison is not found in nature. Notice The composition of this poison is not found in nature. Chance of Natural Occurrence: 0% The composition of this poison is not found in nature. I analyzed the water from the waterfall, and something wasn't right. What do you mean? The poisons in this lake aren't toxins from gold mines. So that's it. Devour all, Beelzebub! Notice. The purification of the poison is complete. All right! Everyone is happy. Yeah. I'm glad. Of course they are! We got permission to cultivate the Great Forest of Jura, Queen Towa is on the road to recovery, and the lake was purified along with the thing that was poisoning it! And it's all thanks to Great Rimuru! Why are you so proud? What are you talking about, Benimaru? I am Great Rimuru's first secretary! That means Great Rimuru and I are of one body and mind! You lost me. Anyway, what do you think that magic circle was all about? It looked pretty old. I'd guess it was made by the same person who put the Curse Poison on the tiara. There's a legend that says the tiara was a gift bestowed by a goddess, but no one knows anything else about it. I don't know if it was a goddess or not, but we'll just have to ask whoever cursed it. Assuming they're still alive, that is. Rimuru! I can't offer much, but I want to express my gratitude in whatever way I can. This is more than enough. There isn't much in this nation that I could give you in return, but someday... Yeah, I'll make sure you repay the favor someday. So for now, can we continue our relationship with Raja? When I saw Towa-san sacrificing herself to protect her country and her people, it made me feel like I have to be just as reliable. I want to continue to be friends with the people of this country. Is that okay? Thank you! Drink with us, Brother! Hey, come on. Shion! Shion, you shouldn't drink too much. Shion! Well, I think I'll go see how Towa-san's doing. Shion, you shouldn't drink too much. Shion! Shion, you shouldn't drink too much. Well, I think I'll go see how Towa-san's doing. You're the only one who's sloshed. Shion, you shouldn't drink too much. Well, I think I'll go see how Towa-san's doing. Well, I think I'll go see how Towa-san's doing. You're the only one who's sloshed. Well, I think I'll go see how Towa-san's doing. Yay! Great Rimuru! Towa-san. How are you feeling? Better and better, thanks to the honey you gave me. I truly thank you for everything. Aw, it was fine. Benimaru and his gang asked me to help, too. I did it because I wanted to. I envy you, Great Rimuru. You're the leader of a nation just like me, but you're open about how you feel and spend your days with your companions. Huh? I'm truly unfair. When I saw Hiiro risking his life for his comrades and protecting them as he fought, I thought he seemed like someone I could trust. That if I saved him, and he joined my side... Towa-san... But, I mean... I know. It was calculating and selfish. But doesn't that go for everyone? We all do some internal calculation sometimes. I don't think being calculating is a bad thing. Huh? Besides, just because you named him doesn't mean you bound his soul to you. Just look at all my friends. They say whatever they want to me, and do whatever they feel like. With some individual variation, of course. Is... that how it works? Yeah, it is. You're just taking things too seriously. If you keep that up, your own sense of responsibility will crush you. You should lighten up and be more honest about your feelings. You're very kind, Great Rimuru. That's what you call "calculating." All so we can continue to get along from now on. H-How can this be?! They're cultivating the Great Forest of Jura?! The lake has been purified?! What is going on? What is going on? Thank you all for your hard work. I don't understand. This can't be possible! It can't be... Thank you all for your hard work. Queen Towa, you seem well. This can't be possible! It can't be... What a relief! The queen has recovered?! Well, well, if it isn't Lacua. M-Master Mobuji! It's been a long time! I've brought a variety of goods for you again! Wonderful. Now, come and relieve the exhaustion of your travels first. So, ah... The atmosphere here seems to have changed somehow. A lot has happened in these past ten days. We can take our time discussing that this evening. Goodbye until then. This is awful! What in the world happened?! How could this be?! My plans were ruined by a Kijin survivor and a slime?! But fulfilling her wish was my ticket to elevating my status! Damn it! Yes... What we need is chaos and tragedy! You know... You don't have to come back here every time. You can use Thought Communication to report to me. That's right, second secretary. What are you talking about, Great Rimuru? Running to your side is no trouble for me at all. It's been a long time since I left the village. Now I'm finally able to come back here with all of you. I'm here today, alive and well, thanks to you all. And... the young master and our other friends are still alive, too. We sure were fired up about earning money to make their lives easier and feed them tasty food. And now all of you are gone... I'm sorry, everyone. If I... If only I were... Great Rimuru told me you were here. If only I were stronger, I could have protected them. Yeah. If only I could have been a better leader... I guess so. I was the one being protected. They gave everything to keep me alive. If it costs my life... If I must give everything I have, next time... Next time, I will protect my comrades! Brother. I always liked that one-track mind of yours. But don't forget that you've got us and Great Rimuru, too. Right. Captain! Bad news! It's Queen Towa! She collapsed? The lake suddenly became so poisoned that the air became toxic, so she used the tiara in an attempt to save her people. So suddenly? I got rid of the weird magic circle that was making the poison, though... Yes. It was completely removed, and all of the poison in the lake was purified. What's this about a weird magic circle? It was at the bottom of the lake. It looked very old. I see... An old magic circle? So the curse spread throughout her body again. The honey Great Rimuru gave her is keeping her alive, but there's another problem... What is it? We received word that the neighboring nation's army is on the move. Everyone is panicking. Great Rimuru, shouldn't you hurry to Raja? Yeah, but... I purified the lake, but it's poisoned again. The neighboring nation made a move the moment Towa-san collapsed... You think it's all too perfect to be coincidental. Exactly. I-I was just about to say that, too! Towa-san had exhausted a great deal of her life force. Was that doctor of theirs, Chikuan, really treating her at all? There are too many questions. Soei! I am here. Find out why Raja is being targeted. At once. Let's go. Right. Shion, get everyone together. Assume counterattack formation! Yes, sir! Chikuan! In her current state, it will be difficult to relocate her. She won't last long enough to avoid the battle and remain on the run. Oh, no... I'm sorry, Hiiro... I couldn't... save your friends... Queen Towa! You have nothing to apologize for! You are... free to do whatever you want. What are you saying? I'm... sorry, Hiiro... There's nothing you need to apologize for at all. Why do you have to suffer like this? As you can tell, we don't know who's pulling the strings behind all this, and we might be facing a battle. But I intend to trust Towa-san and take Raja's side. I'd like all of you to help. SIRIUS No objections from me. SIRIUS We have Brother Hiiro, too. SIRIUS We were all hoping to ask for your help, as well. SIRIUS SIRIUS Then start making preparations right away. Right! Veldora! You want me to stay behind, right? You're the only one I can trust to look after Tempest. I thought so. You can rest easy in knowing that I am on the job! Great Rimuru. I may have an idea as to who created the Curse Poison in the tiara and the magic circle in the lake. What? If you will permit it, I will personally negotiate to have the curse undone. I permit it! I permit it! I'm counting on you, Diablo! Thank you! I will live up to your expectations. Even after Rimuru did all he could, the poison returns. And every time it does, Queen Towa uses the tiara's power. How can we overcome this? Master Hiiro! Do you need something, Lacua? I have some highly confidential information for you. It's about a possible way to save Her Majesty's life. What do you mean? Tell me! There is a secret art. It involves transferring one's soul to another object... or in other words, switching bodies. Such a method can't really exist. I don't blame you for having your doubts. But it does exist! Of course, certain conditions must be met in order to do it. It involves some degree of compatibility. But... Since your soul and Her Majesty's are linked by the ritual of naming, surely it will work out. Truly?! Yes, yes! However! We must also consider this! If we were to transfer Her Majesty's soul into your body, your soul would have nowhere to go, and it may be lost. If you are prepared for that possibility... That is all I can say. You're saying I can give my body... the life that Queen Towa saved... to her? I see. Then, I know what I need to do. Y-You mean... I will return this life to Queen Towa. Begin the process at once. You would sacrifice yourself... What a beautiful heart you have! I am deeply moved! What's that? This is called a "Curse Orb." Curse Orb? One might also call it a secret treasure of power. It's said that it can rebuild a body to be stronger than it was before. It's a highly valuable article I picked up in the far west, but to ensure the success of the ritual for transferring souls, I will need you to swallow it. All right. I feel strange... It just takes a bit of time for your body to accept the orb. Now, let us relocate to a place where no one will interfere. Everyone ready? Yes! Okay, I'll transport us now. Oh, Rimuru! Mobuji-san, Minister. We can't find Her Majesty! What?! Our captain is also missing. Where have they gone at a time like this? Ranga. Yes, Master! We should be able to conduct the ritual in peace here. Now, place Her Majesty up there. Queen Towa, you can rest at ease. Why would Hiiro and the queen come to a place like this? Great Rimuru, may I? Soei, what is it? I know why the neighboring country is targeting Raja. Hang on. The prime minister and minister are here. I'll let them hear this, too. Okay. The neighboring country is after a large gold vein resting beneath Raja. A gold vein? That is the rumor going around in the neighboring country. They are hastily preparing to attack so they can claim it. Uh, I don't know anything about this! I don't, either! If you're lying, you'll regret it! W-Wait, Ranga! They're not lying! It's true that large amounts of gold were dug up here in the past, but now, you won't find any bigger than my little finger! Ranga, these people aren't lying. If they had something like that, they wouldn't be trying to cultivate the Great Forest of Jura. Still... Notice. It is unnatural for their army to mobilize at this point in time. That's true. Still, our first priority has to be protecting this place. Minister, how big is your army? We have about 2,000. Assemble them right away, and evacuate all civilians. But... Don't worry. When the fighting starts, my friends will help you. Minister! Y-Yes! Right away! You two! Yes, sir! Head over to help, too, Soei. Right away. Master, I smell them. So they're beyond here? Now, then, Master Hiiro... Yes. Hiiro? What is... We are going to conduct a ritual to transfer your soul into Master Hiiro's body. You won't have to suffer anymore. What... do you mean? I want to return the life you gave me. Master Hiiro is going to offer up his life to save yours. Don't worry. No... You can't... I won't allow it... Absolutely not! Queen Towa! I'm only doing what I want to do. You can't do this! Your life doesn't belong to you alone! You have to live! Live for yourself, and for your fallen comrades! And... for me... Queen Towa... Those words alone are enough. Begin the ritual. Lacua? Bravo! Excellent! Truly excellent! What a sad, yet lovely, sight! Simply beautiful! What? Oh, I beg your pardon! It was such a beautiful scene, I couldn't help but applaud. When that damned slime ruined my script, it chilled me to the bone... But look! A magnificent recovery, if I do say so myself! Oh, how fun! I'm so happy! Oh! And I'm sure she will be most pleased, as well! What the hell are you talking about?! What about the ritual?! Such a ritual does not exist! You're... A secret art that transfers souls? As if such a convenient solution could truly exist! You tricked me?! Ah, how comical! You did indeed swallow a secret treasure of power, and there is a secret art. But... it's not the secret art you think it is! It is an even greater trial! One that will surely prompt the queen to use the tiara's magic! And then... Once the queen's body has wasted away completely... My lady's applause will rain down upon me! Rewards will befall me like the words of the gospel! You bastard! Yes, that's it! That rage will be the fuse that ignites your despair! Burst, Curse Orb! Hiiro! Hurry! Right! Now, remember, Master Hiiro, while you are still aware! Come on! Remember the despair of seeing your village trampled! The agony of losing your comrades! The anger with yourself for being tricked and having no power to stop it! Marvelous! Your rage and hatred have fueled your descent into madness! Rampage! Destroy! Force your beloved queen to use her power! That will provide my lady the finest possible entertainment! Hiiro? That's it! Go on a rampage! How does it feel to be a Mad Ogre? It's a good feeling to trick someone as simple-minded as you! It looks just like Hell! Hiiro... Ah, Your Majesty! Can you allow this to carry on? You must save Master Hiiro! I have... to save him... Sorry we're late! Huh? You're safe now. That form... What happened to you, Hiiro?! You again?! Are you the one behind all this? Curses! You're in my way at every turn! Hey! Great Rimuru! Go! Take care of him! Shuna, take care of Towa-san! Right! Let's go, Ranga! There he is! He will not escape! Try some of this! You damned slime! Great Rimuru. Soei! The neighboring country's army has begun to march. They will soon reach the Kingdom of Raja's border. Got it! We're kinda busy over here, so... Can you all hear me? I want to keep the losses to a minimum, so you can defeat the enemies if you want, but don't kill anyone if you don't have to. Of course, if you have no other choice, put your own safety first! Got it? Got it! Long time no see, Violet. What are you doing here, Noir? From now on, do not call me "Noir." You can call me "Diablo." You mean you got a name? Hmph. What weirdo would name you? Are you jealous, Violet? We are both ancient demons, but unlike me, you don't have a name. Oh, shut up. Quit bragging and tell me why you came here. I wanted to ask you some questions concerning the Kingdom of Raja. Were you the one who placed a magic circle in the lake there? Huh? Why would I go to all that trouble? And why would you care about that, anyway? I am willing to tell you, but only under the condition that you leave that kingdom alone. No, thanks. Why? Because that kingdom's royal family is my favorite. Your favorite? It was a few decades... no, it might have been a few centuries ago. They asked me for a favor. A favor? I sensed some rather tasty emotions, so I went there purely on a whim. And what do you think the queen said to me? I really don't care. She called me a goddess! Isn't that hilarious? And? She wanted the power to save her kingdom, so I decided to play with her a little. In that case, show me the depth of your resolve. What is this? There is immense magical power stored within this tiara. If it's used up, it will refill itself in time. There seems to be something quite nice buried deep beneath here. See? I thank you. And... what did you mean by "resolve"? Your resolve to play a game with me. A game? That's right. If you use that tiara, you will be cursed. What's more, that curse will be genetic, and you will pass it down to future generations. To my descendants? Shouldn't that be obvious? To obtain the greatest of merits, you must pay the most terrible price! The greater your wish, the deeper the Curse Poison will eat into you. So what'll it be? If it will help me protect my people... If it will help me save my people... If it means my people can live prosperous lives, my own life is but a trifle. I'm sure all those who inherit the throne after me will feel the same. I like that look on your face! If you keep using that, you will eventually be stained the color of my magic. When that happens, I win. I will obtain a body to serve as my host, allowing me to manifest in this world. In other words, if I am not fully colored, then I... Then we are the winners? I can feel its magic... its power. Keep doing your best to entertain me until the end of your bloodline! Now I can save my people... One of your descendants might win the game, but that could be entertaining in itself. That's the story. In other words, you wanted to enjoy watching every generation of her bloodline suffer? Well, I wasn't just gonna help her for free, you know. I'm not running a charity here. So, uh... The current queen's name was Towa, right? She seems like a really nice girl, doesn't she? And it looks like the Curse Poison has taken to her perfectly, so my host body should be complete soon. It'll probably be... the next one after Towa, or the next one after that. So you made a formal contract? It didn't seem that way to me. Did you not just have one of your minions create a problem that would force her to use the tiara? What is this? Are you insulting me? I am only speaking the truth. Very well. If you will leave the Kingdom of Raja alone, I won't tell anyone what you've done. Huh? Why should I have to do as you say? Even though I am here personally, asking you ever so politely? What's polite about any of this? Oh, I do despise resorting to barbaric means such as brute force. Yeah? Well, try me if you think you can. And you know, I've always thought you were a pain in the ass. The feeling is mutual, I'm sure. Come on, bring it! So the big boss shows himself, eh? Have you... gotten stronger? Worry not. I have not used any more power than you are capable of using. Ugh, you're pissing me off! Just because you incarnated and even got a name, you think you can boss me around? You're welcome to be even more jealous if you want. Just die! Well? How'd you like the taste of my Nihilistic Vanish? Are you serious?! My magic... I let it hit me to give you a handicap, but it seems you have reached your limit. Limit? Time's up, huh? It appears the temporary body you made from magicules has begun to fall apart. Hmph. This is nothing. What? You trying to interfere? This is over, milady. Lord Noir... no, Lord Diablo... Would you be so kind as to lay down your arms now? I can still fight! Milady, I bring a report. I know you can tell this isn't the time for that! Lacua has taken matters into his own hands, just as Lord Diablo said. Raja is being attacked by its neighboring country. What? It appears Lacua instigated this with false information. And he did something to the queen's body other than just the Curse Poison. That puts a black mark on our contract. It's no fun this way. Indeed. It would seem that, unfortunately, the contract must be voided. Nothing I can do, I guess. Are you done talking now? I have no interest in your personal circumstances, so if you will leave Raja alone, I will overlook this matter. That condescending tone... You really do have an awful personality. Okay, fine. I'll be the one overlooking this matter. You'd better be grateful for my kindness. What? You are as self-serving as ever, I see. That's what I should be saying to you. Now, milady... Yeah, I know. By the way, who gave you the name "Diablo"? Who in the world is capable of naming you? Someone most exalted. Uh-huh... I will gladly tell you all about Great Rimuru's glory some other time. Rimuru, huh? So long. Imagine leaving without cleaning up your mess. She's making so much work for us. Queen Towa, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'm more concerned about Hiiro... You can count on my brother to handle him. You're still good. Even in that form... You still have every bit of Hiiro's spirit! But... Come back to us, Brother! What's wrong? Done playing tag with us already? Keep talking! You're just a rookie Demon Lord! I already know that you're only borrowing the Storm Dragon Veldora's authority! That's fine, but you might want to face forward. Huh? He can fly, too? Also, does that mean... he's a demon? Now, Queen Towa! Brother Hiiro! Is he back?! No, I don't think he's fully back. Get away from here! If this continues, he'll just cause more damage. Stop, Hiiro! What's wrong? Can't run away any longer? Sh-Shut up! Lacua! I'll back you up! So you were on his side, you quack doctor? No wonder I couldn't see any signs that you'd treated her. Let me handle him! Okay. He's all yours! A mere mutt is no match for me! He was no match for Ranga. So... Lacua, was it? You're about to meet the same end. That's okay with you, right? Don't you underestimate me, you rookie Demon Lord! You're done already? Anything you still want to say? No? W-Wait! Just try and kill me! My lady will not let it slide! Your... lady? That's right! A mere slime like you is no match for... Hey, Lacua. Oh! Goddess of all creation! I'm right here! Your faithful servant, Lacua, is right here! Shut up. Looks like you thought you could do whatever you wanted just because you incarnated and got a name. Goodness, no! You are mistaken! I made Towa use a great deal of magic! Her body will be yours in no time! Who is he talking to? Look, I wanted those queens to choose to give themselves to me. Who told you to take matters into your own hands? I only told you to observe them, did I not? H-Huh? But I thought the more she suffered, the more pleased you would be... My fun is ruined, all because of this idiot. I-I only hoped to gain more power so that you would welcome me by your side... I don't need incompetent servants. Take responsibility for what you've done. Looks like you just got tossed aside. W-Wait! I can't sit by and let anyone toy with other people's lives. To make sure no more lives end up ruined, I'm gonna finish you off right now. Damn it all! If I'm going to die anyway... I'm taking you all with me! My Nuclear Flame... will reduce you... and this entire country... to a pile of ash! Nuclear... Devour all, Beelzebub! ...Flame! Raphael-san, report. Notice. The immense amount of energy has been fully absorbed. No harm was done. Okay, great. That's my master! Apparently, Lacua replaced all the army leaders with his own lackeys. Then these guys... Yep. You can kill them. Leave it to me! This was a bit too much for you. Way to go, Master! Vortex Crash! Great Rimuru, it is over. Good work. If the remaining soldiers have no will to fight, you can let them go home for today. Understood. Now, that just leaves... Hiiro... You don't want to make your beloved master worry any more, do you? Sorry, but I won't be holding back from here on. Hiiro... Please don't die. Haze of Black Smoke! Brother! Hiiro! He can still move? Queen Towa! Hiiro! Hiiro! Brother! Brother! Young master... You've... gotten stronger. Not as strong as you. I had faith that you'd return to your senses on your own. My soul... is not mine alone, after all. The price... for using this power... Hiiro! Brother Hiiro! Benimaru! Use a full potion! He is paying the price for using the Curse Orb. Cannot Heal He is paying the price for using the Curse Orb. The potion is ineffective. Cannot Heal This is enough. Brother! Shuna... I always thought of you as my real little sister. Brother Hiiro... The others are waiting... just ahead... after all. Queen Towa... I'm so happy... to have found... a master worth serving... in the end. I won't allow it. I won't allow you to leave my side. Ugly Tiara! Give me a miracle! Goddess, give me your power! Q-Queen Towa? Queen Towa?! Queen Towa! Queen Towa! This is the price of the wish she made. Nothing can be done. She saved my life twice, and... I still... can't do anything for her? The contract had to be voided because of my own negligence. To thank you for all the entertainment you've given me, I'll splurge a little as an apology. What is this? What's happening? Notice. Confirmed interference by another party. Queen Towa? Queen Towa! Hiiro? The Curse Poison has completely disappeared. Was this what you had "an idea" about, Diablo? You'll have to explain all this later. With pleasure. Cheers! Thanks! Yeah! Yeah! Rimuru! Thank you for all the help you've given us. How in the world can we ever thank you? Even if we wanted to, as you know, we have very little to offer... Yeah, about that... A vein of iron ore was found in a cave that collapsed in Benimaru and Hiiro's battle. But there is little demand for iron ore... There are other nations that supply it. Well, you can never have too much iron ore. We'll buy it from you. You mean you'll contribute to the rebuilding of our kingdom?! In that case, the surrounding nations will find it harder to mess with us! We couldn't possibly ask for more. But are you certain? Of course. It's give-and-take. Besides... I like Towa-san for her willingness to risk her own life to save someone else's. You all agree, right? Yes. Indeed. Yes! No objections. Of course! We love Queen Towa and Brother Hiiro as much as we love Great Rimuru! Thanks! The same goes for me. What, you're still here? Well, then... Here's to the future of the Kingdom of Raja and Tempest! Thank you for protecting this country, and all of us, for this long. From now on, I will stand on my own and build a future along with all of them. To the goddess who gave us the tiara. Wh-What the heck is this?! V-Veldora-kun? I entrusted you with looking after things here, didn't I? It's not my fault. Milim showed up, so I just played with her a bit. That's right. I just came here to play, but it was boring because you weren't here, so I just played with Veldora a bit. F-Forgive us, Great Rimuru. We tried to stop them... But we weren't strong enough. Of course you couldn't stop them. Just trying to is impressive enough. Honestly... I'm not getting the latest volumes of your manga for a while! What?! B-But that's too cruel! You deserve it. And you, Milim? M-Me? Let's have a nice, long talk, shall we? They've got guts to piss me off this much. What a handful.
