They can't-- I know, babe. I'm sorry. It was totally out of my control. Look, I'll definitely make it up to you. I promise. Okay... (woman laughs) So, when will I see you again? We shall see. (man laughs) That's yours. The rest is mine. Oh, okay. I don't know. It was fun, but it wasn't very sparkful. Woman: Not sparktastic? -Sparktastic? -Or sparkalicious. Oh, sparkalicious. Very good, girl. You're so silly. What are you doing now? -Oh, God. I gotta go. -Why? Yeah, the other guy's here already. Two in one day? Yeah, another guy. What? A girl's got to eat. These guys aren't the answer to your problem. It's Saturday, I'm gonna have fun. -Fine. -Don't judge me. -I won't. Bye. -Bye. -Hi. How are you? -Man: Hey, how are you? -You look fantastic. -Oh, thank you, -so much. -Good to see you. -Yeah, these are for you. -Oh, you're so sweet. -These are great. Thank you. -Favorite color, right? Well, you know. I'm wearing it, too. -Nice. -Where are we going? It's so good to see you guys. Oh, and these people. Woman: Trouble has just entered the building. Woo-hoo! ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ ♪ Someone like you ♪ Woman: What are you doing? Singing? -You should totally get scouted. -It's gonna happen. Yeah, in our dreams. Hello, there. My name is Evans. -Woman: Hmm? -Once upon a time, there was a beautiful Malaysian princess... -Mm-hmm! -... who loved film. -Uh-huh! -Woman: Yeah? (humming notes) -She was sweet. -Woman: Yes, I am. What? Eww. And funny. And absolutely crazy. Oh, right here. Crazy people. Don't you wanna know what happens to the princess? No! Never, ever, ever, ever. (laughs) Oh, hi girls. You look gorgeous. Oh my gosh, Peter. You look very festive. -Hey. -How you doing? Good! -Oh. Ow! -Evans: You all right? Woman: Oh, my gosh. Let me go get some shoes. -Evans: Like a drink? -I'm good, but I'll go with. Evans: Come on. Oh. Hey, this seemed like a good spot. Hey, don't pay me no mind. I was about to do the same thing, too. (laughs) You look like you need some help. Um, no. I think I just need to stretch out. Enjoy. That's exciting. -Everything okay? -Mm-hmm. Too much to drink? -Exactly what I needed. -All right. Let's dance. Shoe girl. Shoe guy. You see something you like? What's not to like? Love prints. Looks good on any girl. Especially on a beautiful one. Smooth. I'm Reece. Sarah. -You headed anywhere? -Um... Great. Let's get you another coffee. Sarah: Okay. (giggles) You're kidding me. I've been to Malaysia. No, you haven't. Yes, I took a trip to KL and even a quicker trip to Penang, and the food there is, -oh my God, amazing! -Oh, my God! Did you try the laksa when you were there? The laksa. It's the curry noodle soup with the lettuce. -Oh yeah, I had that twice. -Oh, my gosh! I'll have that every day when I'm back. My mom's amazing. She can cook up a storm. -Really? -Mm-hmm. She cooks that really well. We're gonna have to do something about that. What do you mean? So you can try it everyday. -In Malaysia? -Yes. You're going to take me to Malaysia? Hey, why not? I mean, if you were around long enough. Oh! If you keep me around long enough. -We'll have to see about that. -Mm-hmm. -Reece: Beautiful, as always. -Thank you. Reece: Good timing. How was your trip? It was really good. Sarah: Lot of like, Mumford and Sons. -Have you heard of them? -Reece: No. Sarah: They're like this folk country music-- Oh, wow! ♪ (strumming guitar and humming) ♪ -Thank you. -Sarah: Thank you. C'mon, just a few blocks this way. Okay. Your apartment is amazing, by the way. So much space. I never have enough space for my prints. It's good for now, but it's no Park Avenue. Who cares about Park Avenue? I like places with character. I guess you've been looking at the wrong spots. Maybe. This was really impressive, by the way. Do you want any more pasta? Oh, no, no, no. I'm just so full. Please. Okay. Oh... I do have a surprise for you, don't I? Sarah: Yes, you do. That was a mysterious text. This is for you. What? You've gotta be kidding me. Hope you like it. Reece. Oh, my God. Are you serious? Reece. No, you didn't. Oh, my gosh. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. This is so sweet. -I hope it fits. -No, it's perfect. Isn't that just like you? He's so dreamy. Girl, please. You hardly know him. I know he's hot, and he's been to Malaysia. Can you pass me my hand sanitizer? I feel disgusting. Yeah, where is it? Here it is. What is this? It's a Bible. It's not going to bite you. When did you start reading this? Couple of weeks ago. One of my co-workers took me to church. It's nice. It wasn't what I expected. So, now that you've found Mr. Perfect, what are you gonna do about the other guy? Oh, right. I'm supposed to see Sam tomorrow. You are playing with fire. Well, at least I'm good at it. Don't get my pillows all dirty. I can't believe you knew about the photo exhibit. Hey, when you live in New York, you have to be cultured. Did you get to the final room with the black-and-white photos? -Oh, yes! -Oh my gosh, right? -Amazing work. -Gorgeous. I just love that series on the abandoned warehouses. I love when people find beauty in abandoned things. It just-- Ah, gets me going, you know? I see. Sorry. I get really excited. Reece: That's okay. I like to see you excited. Well, I got to head home. Okay, well... Are you sure I can't take you out to dinner? Sorry, I already made other plans. -Gotta tie up some loose ends. -I hear you. Well, I'll give you a call anyway. -I'd like that. -Reece: Cool. -All right. Goodbye. -Bye-bye. Have you finished that project you were working on last time? -Which? -Last time you were talking about your shoot with all those little kids. Yes, I finished that. That's good. Actually, that's kind of why I'm a little out of it right now. Just exhausted from shooting. Can we, kind of, you know, get the... -You want me to get the check? -Yeah, that'd be nice. Check please. So, there's this film I really think you'll enjoy. Any chance you're free on Saturday? Uh, Saturday. Actually I'm meeting with my editor on Saturday. So it's going to be a long day of it. I didn't mean to be coming on too strong. I just really enjoy spending time with you, and I thought... -It's fine. -It's fine. I get it. Oh, so PT went well? Good, mom. -How are you doing? -Well, I actually met a boy. (speaking Malaysian) No, it's really new, but he seems really great. -So I'll let you know -Just be careful. No. No, I won't let him hurt your little girl. All right. Well, I'm actually headed to the subway, cuz... Yeah, do you want me to call you when I get out? -Okay. -Okay. Call me back. All right. All right. I love you, mom. -Okay, bye-bye. -Bye. Mwah. Okay, now can you tell me what we're having? Reece: I hope you're ready for this. Sarah: Oh, I'm ready for it. Reece: Here, take a look. Oh, my gosh. Are you serious? This is the real thing. Where did you find this? I have my sources. Such a gentleman. Reece: Of course. You know that! Sarah: Oh, this is my favorite. -Madame, for you. -Thank you. And this is for you. Okay, so tell me. Why did you become a trader? -Well, I like numbers. -Uh-huh. The hours are great. I arrive early, and I leave early. Just the way I like it. Okay. Three. Three what? The number of times you said okay. See? I rest my case. -Good, right? -So good. Uh... Oh, dear? Rudolph. -Napkins. -You are really enjoying this. That's good. That's a good sign. I'm not doing too bad after all, huh? And I like a girl that plays a lot. Thank you for today. It's been really nice. -Reece: I'm glad you like it. -What's that? Oh. Before I forget, This is for you. Take them out. Oh, my God. It's a Malaysian placket fish, to keep you company while you're in New York. -You're amazing. Thank you. -You're welcome. Now make sure you take care of that little fella. I will. And you got to give him a name. He's heaven. I mean everything you dream of a guy being, he is. He's funny. He listens. He cooks. Did I tell you about the dress? Yes, you told me all about the dress. Wow, you are really into this guy, huh? Sarah: He makes me happy. He's just perfect, Trish. Well, I only know one perfect man, but he sounds amazing. Hello? Hey, I was just talking about you.

Okay, I'll make this quick, then. Yeah, what's up? Um, I just wanted to say I love you. Yeah, I love you too, silly girl. -Yeah, that's all I want to say. -Okay. -Okay. -Okay, tomorrow. All right. Good night. -Night. -Love you. Bye. -Hey babe, how are you? -Hey. -Bernard. -Hello, darling. Sarah: Thank you so much for doing this. This looks fabulous. Very fun. She's cute. Christine, how's it going? Okay. Pump up the yellow just a little bit. I think I need something a little brighter than that. Expecting someone? Oh yeah, he just hasn't called in a couple of days. He's probably just busy with work. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks so much for helping, by the way. Anything I can do to help. Plus, it beats going into the office. -Sarah, I need you. -All right. So we're done, then. -Evans: Yeah. -Sarah: Oh, great. (sighs) Well, that went well today. Thanks again, guys. For everything. Don't thank me. I'm expecting dinner. Oh, before I forget. I bought you something. A journal. -Oh, this is great. Thank you. -I have your first entry. "Sarah takes Evans and Trish to dinner." Oh my gosh, are you serious? You're such a moocher, Evans. (phone ringing) -Hey. -Reece: Hey, babe. -Where have you been? -Reece: Can I see you tonight? Uh... Why don't you come over? Girl, you know I can't go to bed unless I see you. (Sarah humming) What took you so long? -I had to take the subway here. -Aww... -Oh... -I missed you. You should. I don't know why I'm in Harlem this late. -To see me. What you expect? -Mmm... -You sure you don't want one? -I'm good, thanks. But I do. -Evans: Happy birthday. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Cheers! -Look at this girl. -Oh, my gosh. Hi! Oh, Reece! Sarah: It's so good to see you. -You're looking beautiful. -Sarah: You know Tricia. Hi. Evans. Nice to meet you. Oh, hey Andrea. Wait. We got to go say hi to Andrea. Can you keep Tricia company? Sarah: Oh, Andrea! -So, it is so good to see you. -Yeah, you too. I feel like it's been months. We're always asking you to come out. We never see you. Yeah, just been busy with work. Traveling for work. Things like that happen. Well, you're here now. That's all that matters. That's all that matters. And it means everything to her. She wanted you to come here so badly, so thank you. Yeah, I know. I'm glad I'm here. So you've known Sarah for a long time? About five years now. We met through a mutual friend. -She's like a sister to me. -She's a very beautiful woman. -She is. -Very. Really, really nice. I'm back, I'm back. Good chat? Good chat? Good chat. -Are you having fun? -Yes. Oh. Mommy. Hello, mommy. -Hi, Mommy. -Sarah: Tricia says hello. Mom, I'm at my party right now. Mm-hmm. Can I call you back tonight? All right. I love you. Bye. You know, you're glowing like a light bulb, right about now. Tricia: Did you get home okay last night? Yes, I went to Reece's. -Right. -Oh, he's amazing, Tricia. He had another birthday gift waiting for me. -What'd he get you? -Lace. Sarah! What? It fits perfectly. I know you don't want to hear this, but... I don't know. There's just something about him I don't trust. Oh, c'mon. You don't trust any of the guys I date. Just give him some time. Get to know him. He's amazing. Just be careful. Trish, he's the one for me. I promise you. I know, mom. He bought these tickets to Mexico for Christmas. Isn't it amazing? Mom: Make sure you're both always together. Don't worry. He will keep me safe. All right. I'll call you from Mexico, all right Mom? -Okay, I love you. -Okay. I love you, too. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Oh, yes. (phone rings) Babe, I'm sorry. I can't do Mexico anymore. Some stuff came up at work, and I have to head upstate right away to meet with some partners. But it's Christmas. It was already planned. You bought the tickets. They can't-- I know, babe. I'm sorry. Totally out of my control. Look, I'll definitely make it up to you. -I promise. -Okay... Tricia: Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much for coming out. I just didn't want to spend tonight alone. Don't worry. More turkey for my brother. I'm sorry he canceled. Well, let's not talk about that. Let's toast to you. No baby. We're cheering you. Happy jolly Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! -Ah! -Merry Christmas. Oh, my gosh. Hi! -What are you doing here? -Tricia: Merry Christmas. I don't know. I thought I'd swing by. Sarah: Why aren't you with Charles? We were. We just had dinner, but... -Sarah: Oh, you left him? -Yeah. He went to a bar to meet some girl. We'll meet him later. Thank you. Cheers. Sarah: Cheers. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. -Evans: Good song. -So good. C'mon. Come on. Tricia: Go and dance, girl. There you go. Take a step. * (Christmas pop music) (laughter) -Hi. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Is this your first time here? Uh... Why don't you come sit with me? Okay. If I fall asleep, poke me. Okay? -Hi. -Thank you. (all singing hymns) Man: You may be seated. New York City is a crowded place. But wherever I go, whoever I talk to, I hear over and over and over again the same thing, which is that New York City is also one of the loneliest places to be. Seems like we're surrounded by people and yet they're all running a race, their own little race, to a finish line that they've set in their imagination. It may be a job, a position, a person. But in the Bible we see that God wants us to run towards Him as He first ran towards us. In this city, we're all chasing after something, but in His kingdom, He's chasing after us. God wants to pursue us. He wants to have a relationship with us, to romance us. He longs for us to know His love and... What do you want to drink? You know you don't have anything but water. And you are right. Tap water it is. You know, you didn't have to come over today too, you know. There's no way I'm letting my best friend spend Christmas alone. Well, you're a pleasant surprise. Thank you for the chicken. I hate Keira Knightley in this movie. She's so wrong. And him. Don't go over to your best friend's house and give, like, notes to his wife. I can't even watch this scene. -Gift time? -Gift time. Yes. Hope you like it. I hope you like it. I hope you like it. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Me first. Oh Sarah, I love it. You always said you wanted a picture of us, so... And you took it. My first Sara Leung original. Thank you. -I love you. -I love you. All right. Your turn. Okay. What is it? What is it? A CD? What's this? These are some of my favorite Christian songs, and I made a CD for you. Thank you, babe. And the Bible. I actually went to church this morning, too. Tricia: You did? Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you. I just wanted to check it out. See what the scene was like. It was really interesting. It was not what I expected. So did anything hit you? I remember the first few times I went, I was like a sponge. I just wanted to soak everything in, and it's crazy cuz sometimes, when the pastor's talking, it's like he knows what's going on in my life, and he's talking directly to me. Yeah, I just need some time to, you know... process it, I think. I hear you. Well, the next time you go, let me know. I would love to come with you, and in the meantime I think maybe you can start by reading Psalms. I marked it for you. All right. Thanks, babe. Now you better not fall asleep during this movie. How can I ever fall asleep? Are you kidding me? Cuz Colin Firth is on the screen, look at this. But you always fall asleep in every movie we've ever watched together. I have no recollection of that. Oh my gosh, I hate you. (phone ringing) Sarah: Warrior Productions. Please hold. -Hey. -Sarah: Hey. The guys and I are heading out for a drink. -You want to come? -Oh, I have plans. You're still seeing that guy? That guy has a name, and yes, he's making up for missing Christmas. -He's a jerk. -You're a jerk. -Have a good one. -I will. Bye. Evans: Bye. (phone rings) -Hey. -Reece: Hey. How are you? I'm good. I'm actually just finishing up here, so I can probably meet you -in about 20-- -Reece: Baby, don't get mad. You know I was looking forward to seeing you. I made reservations and everything. It's just another issue just came up with a client, and no one else knows how to handle it. Wait, but Reece, you've already cancel-- Reece: I'll see you tomorrow, okay? (laughs) Oh! Reece... Tricia: This is not okay. He's just really busy right now. A necklace does not make up for it. (Sarah sighs) He said he was sorry. Wow. You look gorgeous. -Thank you. -Never forget your worth. (doorbell rings) Hello. Reece: It's me. So you're still alive. Oh, come on girl, I'm sorry. You know, work's just been getting out of hand and my family's been going through a lot. Is everyone okay? Yeah, my mother's been having a lot of trouble with her back. I keep telling her, if you need any help, just give me a call. If you need to lift something, just give me a call and I'll come by. She's got this pride thing. Want to be Miss Independent. -Is she all right? -Yeah, she's fine. Enough about that. How are you doing? I'm good. But you still could've called to let me know that you were... Reece: I know. I'm sorry. Come here. I missed you. Well, I met someone. -Oh, you what? -Yeah, a real gentleman. He takes me out when he says he will. He picks up the phone when I call. Don't be messing around, talking about you met anyone. You trying to give me a heart attack? Well, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I'm leaving now. No, it's not a problem. I'll see you in a couple of minutes. Right. All right. Bye. Who was that? My mother. She hurt herself. Again. Look, we'll do dinner next week, okay? You always leave so soon. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Three. Reece: What? Three promises I don't know if you'll keep. I promise I will, okay? Four. -Where are you off to so early? -Shh. -What's his name again? -Sarah: Reece. -Another make-up date. -What, you jealous? -What? No. -What? Evans! I'll just tell the boss you had a life-threatening stomach bug. Thank you. Mwah. (ringing) Hey, I was just leaving the office. -I'll see you tonight? -Hey, we need to talk. Can you come over? Why don't I just see you at the restaurant? I gotta get home and change. We need to talk. Uh, okay. I'll see you in ten minutes? -Okay. -All right. Okay, bye. Sarah: What's up, babe? I'm moving out. Okay. I thought you liked the place. I didn't know you had any problems. I don't know how to tell you this. Just say it. What's going on? I messed up. I'm moving in with my fiancée. What? Wait, what? You're joking, right? Reece: No. Wait a minute, you're kidding. Oh, my God. Have you been dating somebody else? Yes. Sarah: For how long? -A little over a year. -Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Reece: Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know how it came to this. I'm... When did you...? How did you...? Who is she? And you're engaged to her? -I'm sorry. -Please tell me you're lying. -Please tell me you're lying. -I wish I could. Reece, please tell me you're lying. -Reece: I wish I could. -You can't be... Oh, my God. I can't... (sobbing) Shh. You're going to be okay. (Sarah sobbing) Oh, God. I want to stop crying. I know just what you need. Times like this, there are only a few things that can make you feel better no matter what, you know? Like nature's medicine. -Oh, God. (laughs) -Which flavor would you like? I don't think so, babe. I don't think I could right now. Then, don't choose. You can have both. I won't judge. You know, babe, you should actually go home. I should probably take a nap, anyways. Are you sure? I can stay. It's all right. Thank you. I just need time alone. Just remember. You're not alone, you know that. -I love you. -I love you, too. Get some rest, and I'll be sure to check in with you tomorrow. -Yeah, thank you. -Tricia: All right, love you. Sarah: I love you more. Mom, it's me. I miss you so much.

And I just wanted to do something for you. I paid for the next few months of rent at my apartment, and I wanted you to take over the place. Reece, I can't. What are you talking about? Look, you always wanted more room for your pictures, and everything. So please, just let me do this for you. Just think about it. He left you some furniture. How generous. Can you put this in the bedroom, please? Sure. Are you sure about living so close to him, Sarah? Sarah: Yes, I'm sure. I'll be fine. Look at this space. I can't find an apartment bigger than this, and you know I do not have time to look for another one. What are these? Oh, those are letters from my father. I'll get rid of them later. Are you here for more space, or do you really think he's going to come back to you? More space. Shut up. Don't get mad at me. You're the one who moved into his apartment. Tricia: Nice. Man: Scripture makes an incredible promise to us. Jesus himself said in the Holy Scriptures, "Come unto me all you who are weary and heavy-laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me and you will, you will find rest for your soul." It's an incredible promise from the Scriptures that if we come to Jesus, he will give us rest. I, Diana, take you, Reece, to be my husband. I promise to be true to you... Lord, I thank You for work that You're doing in this young woman's heart and for the wonderful changes You've brought into her life. I ask that You just continue to bring it to completion, and You give her-- I, Reece Thomas, take you, Diana Santiago-- Man: Lord, I pray for this young man that You would give... Welcome to the family. You may now kiss the bride. (clapping) (mellow strumming) Do you know any hymns? Yeah, sure. ♪ Jesus, I try to be ♪ ♪ Nearer to thee ♪ ♪ (hymn continues) ♪ (Sarah gasping) Sarah, how are you? -I'm good, how are you? -Doing well, doing well. You headed somewhere? Yeah, I'm headed to the subway. Well, I'll walk with you down there, if you don't mind. Um... Yeah, sure. Why not? You know what? I'm actually going to drop by the drug store, so I'll just go there alone. Well, I'm glad I saw you. -Sarah! -Yeah? Reece: I just wanted you to know I think about you all the time. I do. I really do. Girl, you need to turn a new leaf. Block his number. Leave that apartment. I know. I know. I will. I'm serious. Give me your phone. Why do you need my phone? Tricia: We're going to call the phone company. We're not going to call the phone company, Trish. -I'll call them on my own time. -Cut him loose. I will give you money for an apartment if you need it. It's not about the money. I just... I'm here for you. I know. I know that you are, hon, but you just need to understand I really don't think he meant to hurt me. I... -Delivery for Sarah. -Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Is there a note or card, or anything? No. Okay. (sighing) Hey, thanks for covering for me these last few weeks. I know I've been kind of a mess, but... Yeah, thanks. -You better now? -Yeah, I guess so. Can I take you to dinner? Yeah, sure. Let's go to dinner. Oh, there's this new ramen place that we should-- No, like on a date. You want to take me on a date? Yeah. Oh, Evans. I only think of you as a friend. A really, really good friend that means a lot to me. All right. I get it. Sarah: Sorry. (knocking) (gasping) -Reece: Hey, you. -Hey. I missed you. Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls? You know why, Reece. You should leave. Come on, Sarah. Stop this. We need each other. No, you stop this. You're a married man. -Sarah, I love you. -Oh, my God. I can't-- We'll get something to eat and hang out, and come back-- This is wrong, Reece. What's so wrong about this? Me being in love with you, huh? Do you even know what love is? You are married. Do you love your wife? But it's different. I'm not in love with her. I'm in love with you. But you're married. You're married, Reece. Would you stop reminding me? Please. -And we're getting a divorce. -What? Yeah, it's not working out. What do you mean, it's not working out? -You made a-- -It's not working out. -No. -I don't wanna talk about it. No, no, Reece. I don't want to talk about it. Please leave. Please. You know I love you, right? I do. I will always love you. I'm thinking about getting a new marble flooring for the bathroom. I like this one here. Okay, let me see. We'll do whatever makes you happy. (phone rings) Hello. Reece: Hey, it's me. I need your help. My computer won't let me finish this report for my meeting tomorrow. You helped me with the same thing before, so I really need your help. Reece, I've already taught you how to do that. Reece: It'll be a lot faster if you did it. C'mon, I'll be in and out of the house before you know it -Change that one, right there. -Oh, I know what I'm doing. Reece: Change that one right there. This is a mess, Reece. I told you it would be faster if you were doing it. No, you're just lazy. Yeah, I'll admit to that. I'll admit to that, sometimes. I really appreciate this, though. The only way I could thank you is, you know, take you out to dinner. Oh no, Reece. We're not doing that. What's this? Christian music? This is new. Sarah: Yeah, I started going to church. Why do you want to be a little stick in the mud? -A stick in the mud? -Yeah, you all tensed up. -Just come on, relax. -Ow, stop. C'mon, see. I'll make you laugh. Come on. -Come on, Sarah. -You're at work. -We can do that later. -Stop. See, that's what I'm talking about. No, you should go home, Reece. I don't want to. -No, we shouldn't be doing this. -Shh... I love you. (phone rings) -Hey, Evs. -Evans: Hey. -What's up? -Evans: Let's party tonight. Uh, no. I don't think so. Clubbing's not really my thing anymore. Oh, come on. No clubbing? Yes, there are other ways to spend my time. I was thinking about checking out some of these games happening at this stadium. -Man: Any more requests? -Sarah: No, not today. Yeah, get a job. This guy bugs you every day. So, like I was saying, I was thinking about going to check out some of these games. You know, if you were available. You know, we could do some other stuff, too. Sarah, what's the matter? I'm the other woman. What? What are you talking about? You come over and you get what you want, and then you go home to your wife. I never treated you like you were the other woman. I don't even wear my ring when I'm with you. -It's not about the ring. -Then, what is it about? Why do you always got to ruin things? -Me? -Yes, you. Look, let's just go. Come on, please. You're bringing me down. I feel so dirty. When I'm with you. I just can't do this anymore. Do you understand? I want to feel clean again. I want to feel like me again. I want to... Say, what is wrong? What is wrong? (cries out and sobs) Hey baby, how was your day? Diana: Fine. How was your event? Exhausting. Sounds like you had a long day. Yeah, pretty much. Do you want me to make you something to eat? -I'm fine, baby. -Okay. -I love you. -I love you, too. Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours? No one condemned you." She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said to her, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more." Then Jesus spoke to them again saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life." I am so sorry, God. I am so sorry. Oh, thank You. Thank You so much. (sobs) I'm forgiven. I'm forgiven. Forgiveness is a tricky subject. Why is it so difficult? Perhaps it's because God says that we are forgiven as we forgive others. I'm sure some of you would agree with me, and perhaps a lot of you would agree with me, that sometimes it's difficult to believe that everything we've ever done, everything that's bad or horrible or wrong, can be forgiven. But to take that next step and to actually forgive somebody who's wronged us, somebody who's torn us down, who's spit on us, that's not easy. It's not easy at all. You know I coulda just gone to the apartment, right? I'm moving out. What? I'm moving out. Found a new place. I'll be out by the end of the week. I'll leave the keys in the apartment. You know you don't have to do this. You're not gonna divorce your wife, and I don't even want you to. No more, okay? I forgive you. No more, but I'm done. -Take care of him. -Sarah. (sighs) It feels so good to be leaving this place. No kidding. I can't tell you how freeing it was to just walk away from him. What's wrong? Just can't believe it took me so long to wake up. Sarah, you're an amazing woman. Please, you're an amazing friend. No, seriously, Tricia. Thank you so much for just sticking with me through all the freaking crazies. I know there's someone truly special out there waiting for you. Someone who's gonna recognize and cherish you for the beautiful person you are, outside and in. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. (knocking) Come in. -Yes, Tardy McTardison. -Let's do this. -Sarah: All this by yourself? -Evans: Yeah, I got it. Sarah: All right. See you guys later. Dad: Hey, sweetie. I've been thinking about you and missing you during the holidays. These are the loneliest time for me every year. Do you remember when your mom and I got you that stuffed dog when you were little? You loved it so much. It made me feel so happy to see your face light up when you opened it. I can't wait to spend another Christmas with you. (paper tearing) Dad: Sarah, I know my leaving has hurt and caused you a lot of pain. Your mother say you're not smiling anymore. Baby, you're a beautiful girl, and your smile was always so contagious. You made me smile. My leaving has nothing to do with you. I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. Maybe I'll get to see you soon. I love you. All the love in the world. Your father. Sarah: Dear dad, I'm sorry for the many years we've not spoken, the many years I've stayed mad at you. When you left us, I couldn't get beyond the betrayal and hurt. The pain was deep, dad. And I thought I would never be able to get past the pain. But I've recently found a new start. I've discovered God, and I finally think I understand love and forgiveness. I finally know my self-worth, and what it means to really love myself. The many times I've failed, God has never stopped loving me, and still saw me as his precious child. Sarah, you almost ready? What's this? They're the letters. Well, we're ready when you are, babes, but take your time. Thank you. I just want you to know that I love you, and thank you for never giving up on me, despite my lack of response.
