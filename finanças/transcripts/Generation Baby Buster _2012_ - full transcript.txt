Once upon a time, in a place like many others, a young woman was drowning in a sea full of mothers. The weddings had long since come and gone, and all of a sudden, everywhere, spawn. And what, she thought, will become of me? Frowning and whining and a growing income disparity? Having children, am I supposed to be next? Tired and ragged, a God-awful mess? Goodbye, margaritas. Farewell, tonic and gin. Adi√≥s, travel, and adventure, and forever sleeping in. Perhaps, then, I could be child-free. That sounds like lots of fun to me. But why is it that I feel this way? Is it because of the parenting culture today? Are mothers too sad, too stressed, too tired, terrified that after baby, they'll be fired? Men, too lazy. Women have to do it all. The market's so hungry, we're slaves to them all. Or could it be there's some other way to be a mom? One that is perhaps, who knows, even fun! A journey, I think, for me has begun. I will face down my dragons and head for the sun. And in the end, I might just find my own way, after listening to what the prophets have to say. Will I then leap blindly into the unknown? Have me a child? Make me a home? Or will I discover that what was never lost need not be found, and say, screw it. Bartender? Another round. Do you think lives are... would be better without children? Yes, probably, yes. And then you can play as long as you like. I understand that biologically, that is what we're supposed to do, but, you know, I do understand that, you know, some women may not, you know, want to do it. Yay, a child! Oh, please, how many of us know women who never should've had children? If you don't feel comfortable around children, or if you dislike children, or if just the idea of being around children makes you squirm, I'm not sure I need to convince you that you need to be a parent. There's a certain percentage you like, there's a certain percentage that you're like, kind of getting through it and then there's a certain percentage that you just fuckin' can't fuckin' have! I just held two children that aren't mine for two hours, and I want to bathe in Purell immediately. Don't be sad! Don't be sad! That's me. Babies scare me. I'm just not so sure that I'm up to the task of creating and raising a whole other human. I have a great family, but I like being the kid. And now I've gotten quite used to my own little family of three. Having a baby means a lifestyle overhaul. The view from the fence is just fine. But I envy those on both sides who've made up their mind. All you fence-sitters out there, you know what I'm talking about. We put it off, we make excuses, but most of all, we love our lives. My biggest worry? What to do on the weekend. No diapers, no chauffeuring, no having a talk with a teenager who stole your marijuana. It's neat, it's nice. Why elect chaos? Corrine Maier understands what's at stake. The French author wrote, "No Kids: 40 Good Reasons Not to Have Children." And she's a mother. Not surprisingly, her book ruffled some feathers. But Corrine holds nothing back in her account of the volcanic destruction that children can erupt all over your life. The more parents take care of their children, the more they are ugly, in fact. I don't know if you have noticed it, there are a lot of children that are ugly, so ugly. You think you have to be a kind of example for them, so, of course, you try to be, I wouldn't say perfect, but you try to be normal. So you avoid, for example, drinking too much with friends at home, smoking pot, for example. Mama? So, in fact, there are a lot of things that you don't do, and sometimes it's very boring to try to be normal in front of your children. Small children are some kind of savages, and they break everything they touch. They put a mess everything they go, they say things that they're not, they shouldn't say, they show you an image of yourself that can be a disaster, because to them, you, the mother, is a monster. You try to do the best, you try to be perfect, you expect your children to be perfect. Just be patient and you'll have a turn after... It's a 20 years contract, at least. So, what a nightmare. If you could go back to the point where you made the decision to have children, today, in a time machine, would you not? I sometimes regret to have had children... when they are too mischievous or... a couple of months ago when I had to go to the police station to fetch my teenage boy, and there are moments when you really regret, in fact, and you think, "Oh, I've made a huge mistake." But there are also moments when everything is fine, and when they are nice. I think, as Sigmund Freud said it, whatever you do for your child, you are doomed to fail anyway. So, I think we are doomed to fail, and our parents failed, too. We have to think twice before we have children. Failure, forgotten dreams, ugly children. No wonder I'm afraid to have kids. Bringing up baby is not all rainbows and sunshine. The sleep deprivation is definitely a shock to the system. It was like, holy cow. How do you function? You know, like, you expect not to sleep, but what it's like to actually not sleep for five months? You know, you have the sleepless nights, and you're up at 4:00 in the morning, and the baby's screaming, and you haven't slept in months, and it doesn't quite fit the same picture of what you imagined when you were pregnant and glowing. There's a never-ending list of things to do, like feeding her, or bath time, or changing her. Like, I was surprised, really surprised at how much work it was, even though people warn you. It's more. It's like, even more than that. The truth is, more and more women everywhere are just saying no to procreation. Madelyn Cain calls it a revolution... "The Childless Revolution." She wrote about the surge of women who are not having kids, whether it be by choice, chance, or happenstance. I expected a lot of women to be unhappy that they were childless. And they weren't. I mean, there were certainly some who were tragically childless, but there were a lot of women who... had thought that they were gonna have kids when they were younger. When they were younger, they thought, "Well, someday I'll marry, and I'll have children." And they were women who evolved into childlessness. I don't wanna have kids until much, much later in life. I mean, I'm 24, so I'm thinking at least 10 more years, at least. I have their names figured out, but I don't exactly have the timeline. I mean, maybe if you had asked me, like, when I was 18, when I thought I was gonna have kids, it would probably be, like, right now. So, no, it just keeps getting pushed back, five more years, or five more years, or five more years. Why do you think they're putting off the decision? It's a tough decision. It's a huge decision, it's a life-altering decision. It's a decision that you are leaping into the unknown. You don't know if your child's gonna be healthy, you don't know if you're gonna get along with your child, you don't know what the future holds. And generally, a woman who's 35 or so has finally established herself, and is enjoying her life, and things are kinda going pretty good. That's a napkin trick. And so you start to say, "Well, I, you know, I don't wanna make these huge life-altering decisions now." So they started to evolve into being women who said, "You know what, I think I'm fine. I think I can pass on this. I don't have to do everything." We don't have to be an example for anyone. My mother's generation, they all had babies when they were 20, 22, 23, and they were kind of ignorant about what was gonna happen. And they were also allowed, by the way, to not like being mothers. And we don't allow that anymore. Now, you have to be just happy, happy, happy. And nobody wants to talk about the fact that motherhood is sacrifice, it really... if you're gonna be a good mother, it means that you come second, or even third. In the olden days, it was family-centered, you know, your folks lived upstairs, and you lived downstairs, and your aunt and uncle lived here, you know, and that helped raise the children, too, by the way. Women were home, they were not working, and you had a support system to raise children. Now, we all have moved to different places, so that if you have a child, there's no aunt or uncle, there's no grandma and grandpa nearby to help you. So, it's put a terrible strain on young families. Childlessness, when you think about it, is really a move towards wanted children. If we can finally give women approval for choosing not to have children, that means that the people who really want children, who should be having children, have them. And then we'd have a really balanced society. Okay, what's nice about not having, like, major familial responsibilities? What do you mean, I have to take care of myself? - I don't feel... - I have a cat, occasionally. I have a cat right now, a new foster cat. Personally, I've never been around a child in my life. Well then, how could you ever have the courage to have a baby? I mean, really, that would be, that's like me saying, "Well, now I'm gonna go fly a plane." And you talk about a big leap, your leap would be over a cliff. How old are you? Terrified of the leap. Uh, 32. You're, you're right on the edge. You're right on the edge. Well, you're gonna have babies that are gonna spit up on you, your sex life's gonna be ruined, it's gonna be horrible for awhile, your career's gonna... And, you're going to, you're going to understand what someone says when they say, I would kill for this child. You will, and you'll mean it. And that's a feeling you've never had before. You will have a deep sense of peace in your sense of protecting this child you've never known before. So it's like, okay. Am I up for it? I don't know. It's wild, it's a wild ride. Hmm, as in, rollercoaster thrill ride? Or spinning teacup barf-fest? Ready... go! While "Baby not on board" is rising in the polls, not everyone elected to be part of the crowd. Lives and futures don't always go as planned. And often a bad case of deferral leads to an expired "best before" date. I worry about this on hot lazy afternoons. Unfortunately, having a baby is not something you can choose to do at any time. When is it time to get on with it, or just get past it? Do you think I should have a baby? I think you'd make a great mom. I don't have any patience. Yeah, but you'll learn. You don't have a lot of choice, especially if you have a child like you. It's terrible, but I like to drink beer too much. You can still drink beer. But now you only get to have one, maybe two. And that's it. Beer helps with milk production. The dynamics between me and my group of friends has changed so significantly in the past two years, because they're having kids, and their priorities are different, and, you know, a lounge-y dinner isn't, doesn't happen, and if they have to leave at 7:00, or everyone's gone at 9:00, you're thinking, we used to not have dinner until 9:00. Okay, do I have to find a new group of friends? Or do I just have a baby now so that I can at least hang out with them? It started right after we got married, actually. "So, why aren't you pregnant yet?" "Where's the baby already, you guys?" So, yeah, it's really kind of been a struggle, and I don't think a lot of people understand, you know, our decision. Deirdre Macken, upon noticing that the Australian birth rate had plummeted, wrote a book called, "Oh no, we forgot to have children!" "It's not like we consciously decide that we don't want them," she says, "it's that we forgot about it, and then it became impossible." I started to wonder, how is it that all these little decisions, or non-decisions, that women have made over the last 30 years have added up to a society that's not having children? I tend to think there's never a good time to have children. You can always think of a good excuse, or a good reason, not to have children right now. "Well, my partner and I have to be really settled. We have to have had all the fun, and done all the travel. We have to have a proper house where we can raise kids. I have to be settled in my career. I have to make sure I've got a bit of savings and my partner and I must be really happy together, and then we'll think about it." To get all those aces lined up at the one time, really doesn't happen that often in life, and if you insist on leaving it to when all those things line up, you're probably not gonna have a kid, or you might not have that many. So I think we need to chill a bit and, instead of being at the end of the queue, children should probably be moved a bit further up, because you can get that other stuff later. You can't really have kids outside of the biological time set. Having children is, perhaps, more of an irrational decision, rather than a rational one. Certainly on economic terms, it's very hard to justify having children, because you used to have children to till the fields or to look after you in your old age. What we've done is we've privatized the costs of childhood, and socialized the costs of old age, so it's a less rational decision than it's ever been before. It's outside of that work spin cycle, and yet, all the messages we get are the work spin cycle. So it takes a real effort for most people to shift their priorities, and shift their thinking to outside of that capitalist cycle, and think, "Well, what sort of friend... friendship groups do I wanna build? What sort of family do I wanna build? How do I wanna spend the time that is mine outside that cycle?" And I think you can, so easily, especially in your 20s and 30s, when you're getting a lot of feedback from your career, get very caught up in that cycle, and forget that it's actually going to be your relationships that will provide the long term joy and support in your life. And unless you make room for that, the capitalist system isn't going to call time out for you. They're not going to encourage it, because they don't make enough money out of it. And yet, capitalist system obviously lives off the labor that we produced in those cribs. But you have to take control of it, and prioritize... start prioritizing where your best interests lie. I always thought, "Yeah, we'll have kids, you know, eventually, we're gonna have kids." You always said, "Yeah, well, yeah, eventually, but, you know, maybe not." And then... And then I was like, "No, we don't need to have kids," and then I'm like, "Huh, well, I'll have to get used to that thought of not having kids." You know, it doesn't feel wrong, and it might be interesting to not have kids, this is great. What are your intentions now? We'll have kids. I guess we're gonna have kids. - I don't know when, though. - There's... Maybe next year... If I say we're not having kids, what do you say? Yeah, no, I think we should have kids. Yeah, but not, I don't know. I've said, "Oh, let's not have kids," and then it's... Who knows. Making the decision. That's part one. And we all pretty much learned in sex ed class as teens that if you do it without protection, you instantly will have a baby nine months later. The sad truth is, it's not always so easy to have a baby, and while reproductive technology has come a long way, it's not a magic baby-making elixir. We're just born with all the eggs we're ever going to have, and as we get older, our eggs do too. You can look so great, and feel so fantastic, but just because you can finish a triathlon does not mean your eggs are up to speed. Not to mention all the shitty problems that can make getting pregnant difficult, or even impossible. Sexually transmitted disease, blocked tubes, endometriosis, infection, regular menstrual cycles, many little cysts, people who are overweight, problems that are related to the man, the count, the motility, and the morphology. So how many sperm there are, how many are moving, and whether they look normal. Wow. 'Nuff said. Apparently, roadblocks are common on the highway to Huggies. Yeah, like, it's an interesting debate for me, because it's not... "Do I wanna have children or don't I wanna have children?" Before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I didn't know anyone with breast cancer. I would've never thought that would be my reality, and then all of a sudden it is, and it's just a road that you thought was gonna be easy. "I can have a kid when I want." All of a sudden, there's this huge roadblock that goes... spans six years, and you're like, "Wait a minute. I can't have a kid when I want." At 29 you kinda think, "People are living to 90, I'm invincible, I'm gonna be here forever, so I have lots of time to work on career, marriage, I can have kids in my late 30s." Like, no problem, you don't think that something's gonna stop you, which is, you know, a great thing about being young, is you don't see your own mortality, but then all of a sudden if you have a disease, like cancer, then you're like, "Wait a minute, everything's different, the chips are all gonna be different for me." Professor Neil Gilbert from the University of California at Berkeley is concerned about the amount of women foregoing and delaying motherhood. He blames a general lack of kudos for mothers in our culture. Is it feminism, capitalism, market and consumerism? We had a lot to talk about. It struck me as startling, the proportion of childless women had doubled in 25 years. In a period of time that was not marked by plague, pestilence, famine, any of that stuff, the same thing happened with regard to the proportion of women with one child, that also doubled. And so, I was curious, because there was no... sort of big media splash about this, and no explanation. The typical reason you hear people say is, "We can't afford it." Historically, people have never been better off. So it's not that you can't afford it. What they mean is, they can't afford their lifestyle. There's, "I can't afford to have two cars, and a sailboat, and go skiing, and take vacations in Spain... and have two children." So then, the question becomes, "Well, why are these preferences different?" Why are people now saying, "No, children aren't that important"? Certain norms have changed in society, and the capitalist ethos has captured all of us. Everything we do, we make cost-benefit assessments. What are the costs, what are the benefits? The costs of having children are readily apparent, the benefits are harder to calculate. There's been a feminist revolution which has elevated the emotional and psychological benefits of work and career. You stay at home and raise a child, it's mindless, mind numbing kind of work, whereas you're out in the world, you're enjoying yourself, you have power, you have independence, you have freedom, self-realization. That's a lot of baloney. However, most people who write and talk and think about this issue disagree. The reason that they believe this is 'cause they're like you and like me. They don't have real jobs. Producers stay on until they fall over the camera, professors, until they drown in their soup at the faculty club. They don't realize that the person serving lunch is doing the real work. If one of the parents stayed home for five to seven years, and they had two children, until the children were five years old and in school all day long, at which time the value of household labor declines dramatically, and then they go to work for the rest of their life, they have 30, 30, 40 years, be bored silly. And will they rise as high? Most people, it wouldn't make much difference. There are a few things that you couldn't do. If you started late in life, it'd be harder to become a Supreme Court justice. But the children are raised by the family, and they're socialized, and the quality of life, for everybody, I think, is improved. You look at Sex and the City, all the glamour, all the fun, all the good things don't involve changing diapers. You compare it to Ozzie and Harriet... The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. With all the kids in the family around, there was a sense of great enjoyment. Now the sense of enjoyment is the girls out meeting for cocktails, and, you know, talking about their love lives, and what have you. For women, particularly, it's like having a Porsche, a car, a wonderful piece of machinery that can go 130 miles an hour... and never driving it more than 20 miles. You know, here, they have the capacity to make life, this incredible machinery, to nurture life, to grow life inside them, and it's never used. The question I ask is, is this question. I even ask it for you, you don't have to answer it, because I know it'd be difficult. You have a partner, yes? Now, if you ran into a situation where the choice were posed to you, look, either we have to kill you, or we have to kill your partner-- one of you has to die. You can make the decision. Right? You can make the decision. Is it you or your partner? I asked a group of my colleagues about it, some of our older colleagues about it, and there was grand silence. No one, people looked around, no one wanted, no one wanted to talk much about it. And I did not press the issue, and then I changed the question. Just very slightly. I said, now, what if the choice were you or your child? Oh, there's absolutely no... there's no question. So, what in life do you love more than yourself? What is transcendental, what takes you outside of yourself more than children, there is none. I think there's something on your face. Yeah. Whoa, where'd that come from? Despite all the lip service we pay to mothers, motherhood continues to be the leading cause of poverty among women. Ann Crittenden found that after the birth of her child, she lost both respect and status in her workplace. I wrote "The Price of Motherhood" really directly out of personal experience. I had been, at that time, I was at "The New York Times", I had a nice maternity leave, and then, six months later, I was, had the decision to go back, and in the meantime, I'd rather fallen in love with my baby, and I just didn't see going back to 12-hour workdays, so I quit, and when I quit, I was immediately struck one was, this work of raising a child was the hardest, most challenging work I'd ever done. Number two, I seemed to be the only one who thought that. Because it seemed that I had lost tremendous status from becoming a mother as opposed to a reporter for "The New York Times". I was at a Washington cocktail party where I joked that bragging about your skills as a parent is sort of like bragging about your skills at group sex at a church social in Kansas City, or something. But anyway, I, you know, had a guy come across the room to me, and he said, and he wasn't trying to put me down, he was being very nice, actually, and he said, "Hey, didn't you used to be Ann Crittenden?" Motherhood just doesn't carry the day in a culture that respects money above everything else. If it doesn't earn any money, much less any serious money, it just doesn't gather respect. Open up! Mothers operate out of love, they're not looking to earn money, they're not looking for economic rewards, that's not their motivation. There we go! So, it's very easy to take it for granted. In divorce, there's a rule that another scholar called, "He who earns it, owns it" rule. Divorce is not very fair, and it doesn't respect the contribution made by the party who's putting in their time and effort to the children. Motherhood is the single greatest risk factor for poverty in old age. And possibly the single greatest risk factor for poverty at any age. So, that's pretty dramatic, I think. And you mentioned that the US has one of the lowest labor force participation rates for college educated women. Yeah, isn't that interesting? You could call that a waste of education, I hesitate to do that, because they're using it in their home work and their child rearing, but it certainly indicates women are not fulfilling the dreams they had, if they take the time and trouble and expense of getting a higher education, you assume they had something in mind there. They wanted to have a career, or they wanted to have an income that went with that, and if they're not, something is probably going not the way they planned. And I think we have made it too hard. The phrase I use to describe the loss of lifetime earnings when you have a child. And it comes about because so many people quit and then they go back in working later, some months or years later. And the numbers show, they never quite make up for that time out of the labor force. That adds up. In this country, it could be as much as a million dollars over your lifetime, if you have a college degree. There is an unacknowledged bias against mothers, as opposed to women. So some of the old stereotypes about women are gone, but the new one is of mothers, and the assumption often is, a mother is softer, nicer, but maybe not quite as sharp or efficient or dedicated to the job, as a childless one, or a man. The newest numbers show that young women in the job market under 30 are making more money than men. Young childless women. They're just doing great. So it's not a situation of old-fashioned sex discrimination. The majority of Americans polled, they don't think it's essential to a happy marriage to have children anymore, I mean, we've gotten a whole different attitude, you know, too, children are more optional. And that's a disadvantage for people in families who want more social support. Because they're told, "Well, it's just your choice, it's just an option. Nobody made you have a kid, so why should we help support your choice?" And do you think motherhood is the most important job in the world? Yeah, I still think that. Even though my part of it's over. Not over, it never is over. How could I say that? Yeah, sure it is. And fatherhood as well, I should add. Are you full-time at home? Yes. - We all are. - Yeah. That was hard for me, I've only been stay-at-home for just over two years. That was... I still have a hard time coming to terms with not making money. It's a sacrifice that... well, I guess the whole family's kind of making so we can do that. And I like being at home with my kids. I heard from 0 to 4 is when they get their morals and their values and that kind of really important... You wanna be the one to... - Foundations, yeah. - Yeah, exactly. You don't want someone else bringing up your kids. I knew I was compromising certain things with my career by having a family. And I know I don't have to give up my career, but it's certainly taken a different path than if I hadn't had a family. So I do find myself, you know, I've had two children now in a short amount of time, I find myself behind my colleagues who would be around the same age as me. Graduate high school, go to university, get your degree, work your butt off. Modern woman has had plans since she learned the alphabet. How, then, do you shift gears and end up at home on diaper duty? Should you really wager all you've earned for a full house? Sylvia Ann Hewlett wrote a controversial handbook: "Creating a Life: What Every Woman Needs to Know About Having a Baby and a Career." She thinks women should be as intentional about their personal lives as they are about their professional ones. I took a kind of group of very successful women, ranging from, you know, opera singers to news anchors to prominent academics to talk about how they had cleared all of those hurdles, you know, crashed through all of those glass ceilings. And the huge surprise, after I'd done these interviews, was to realize that actually, none of them had children. And of the 42 percent of women in corporate America who ended up not having children at age 40, only 14 percent said that they had planned on lives without children. So for, you know, the rest of those who ended up not having children, it was, as one woman put it, "A creeping non-choice." That, you know, the possibility of having children had been edged out by the press of their careers, by the difficulty they'd experienced in finding a partner, and just by the... you know, the collective stress of the lives that they were leading. I found it was very tempting for high achieving women who like to have a lot of control in their lives to have a sense that a solution to delaying childbearing, to delaying the personal agenda, was essentially medical technology, that assisted reproduction and all of those fancy techniques would bail them out. But that isn't nearly as true as we would like it to be. I've done a lot of work with employers. We've got a couple of big studies on on-ramps and off-ramps, you know. How to avoid some of the penalties attached to taking time out from your career. Companies are trying to create more flexibility. It's much less expensive for them to allow a high-performing woman to come back in than to try and recruit a lateral hire. Big piece of advice to younger women is, you know, check this out, because if you can stay on track, maybe go to a four-day work week, maybe, you know, telecommute for two days a week, you are much more likely, at age 40, to be in a well-paid job with reasonable promotional prospects, than if you had to take a couple years out because there was no way in which you could deal with this very rigid job. "Creating a Life" became a very controversial book. Many women, myself included, were upset by the "land a man" emphasis. I asked Sylvia for her reaction to all the negative press. I guess I found that reaction a little unexpected, because, you know, I've always been a career woman. The early 2000s, the more you earned, the more powerful you were as a woman, the less likely it was you had a partner or children. And for men, the reverse was true. So it's a very uneven playing field. I was seeking to redress the balance, seeking to create the conditions that could allow women to have more of the good stuff in life, but I was certainly starting from the premise that, of course, we want to find fulfillment in our work. But, you know, love and work are the two pillars and, you know, Freud got that piece right. And I think that both men and women are entitled to a shot at both. So if you manage to meet someone you like, and get a job that allows you to manage career and family, what about your relationship? How do you go from being a couple, both living and working out in the world, to reorganizing around baby? Is sex over? Romance dead? Traditional relationships reborn? And you know what is scary too, is like, what if this child in your life ruins our relationship? You know, we suddenly become totally different in our choices, like, "No, I think the baby should have this," and, you know, and then it ruins our relationship. And then, you know, so many people become single parents, and that is also a scary part, you know? Like, are we seriously gonna take this decision, are we gonna do this together? Professor Bonnie Fox from the University of Toronto spent two years following couples as they transitioned into parenthood. She interviewed them before the birth, right after, and a year later. Her findings? Somewhat grim. It's hard on a relationship. It really is a period where time pressures are tremendous. Women, for example, don't have time to spend focusing on their partners. So the focus is on the baby. You know, the joke in my department when I was doing my research was that I was watching all these couples' relationships get worse. But the anxiety of feeling like they didn't quite know what they were doing, or how to do it well, at the same time, they had the largest responsibility they had ever had. So one of the things I realized was that on the one hand, things are not clearly being negotiated. So, a woman gets pregnant, it's assumed she will be the primary caregiver. It's assumed that she will stay home. Whose needs are taking priority, whose needs get met? In the first few weeks and months after the baby was born, women are absolutely absorbed. And what needs to be negotiated is that this is okay for me to be 100 % absorbed in baby care. And that means, for the man, he's not getting any attention at all. You know, no sex, beyond that, no time for me to say, "How was your day?" And for you to tell me, and for me to care. And some of the men couldn't live with it, and so some of the women ended up changing the way they were caring for their babies. Women feel more dependent on their partners when they become mothers. If the men prioritize the baby, and they were involved in the baby care, that wasn't subtracting from their relationship. They could understand that kind of focus. And you're gonna grow up and be a teenage girl someday. If they weren't very involved in the care of the baby, and the baby was just taking away from their relationship, then they had... then it was a problem. What I saw in my study was that women who were very close to women who had no, who did not have children, often were not in relationships either. Those friendships somehow disappeared. I mean, literally, those women didn't come to see the baby, they didn't come to visit, they just kind of fell off. Overall, I would say that the conventional relationships were in more trouble, and the women were having a much harder time, and conventional relationships are actually the source of problems for women, and for men, both. Almost 20 of my friends had babies in 2008. And I really feel that they really lost a sense of themselves. When they started their families, they put their careers on hold, and they became totally self-absorbed in this role as wife and mother, which, you know, is honorable, because you certainly have to prioritize. But, at the same time, I didn't get to see my friends and spend as much time with my friends, and, you know, I was feeling very, sort of, neglected, and left out, and, you know, that's when I, you know, very honestly, started thinking, oh, well, maybe I should do this. You know, just so I can be with my friends again and fit into their lives in some way, because I think a lot of the feedback that I'm getting right now is that, "Oh, well, you don't know. Don't give me any advice, because you don't know. You don't have that experience," and, you know... Yeah, I don't think that my point of view is valued as much anymore, because I don't have that experience. I notice personally that a lot of my friend that have kids just, like, they drop off the planet. Yeah, but, a lot of people that don't have kids drop off the planet. And I'd, you know, that's what I call gettin' the fear. I mean, it's called gettin' the fear, so I'm like, "Did he get the fear?" You know, and the fear is, and I don't know what it is, the idea all of a sudden, whether you're 30, whether you're 29, whether you got a girlfriend, whether you got a boyfriend, that, you know, you've gotta like, do something correctly or, you know, you've gotta be this, or be that, I'm going wrong, and they get the fear. And they're like, they're afraid to go have a beer anymore. I'm not here to advocate drugs or alcohol or any of that sort of shit, but they're just afraid to be out doin' stuff anymore, you know? Okay, let's make a train! Nate, you gotta give up your gun. Why is it that a cute little two-footer can wreak havoc on a friendship? What is it about becoming parents that leads so many couples to revert to this "man is moneymaker, woman is nurturer" kind of thing? Mother knows best, and women's intuition lets dad off the hook for everything besides bringing home the bacon. And women are left to do the double shift. Filmmaker Dana Glazer explores The Evolution of Dad. He views the current culture around parenting and work damaging to men, women, and children. When I was growin' up, my dad wasn't around... Dads were always working late at night... My dad is unlike any other dad. My dad's a very interesting man... It was unique... - When I became a father, I felt exhilaration and panic. And then, I became a stay-at-home dad, and I felt alone. And sometimes, like less of a man. Fatherhood is kinda... it's a very twisted thing in American society, because the main, the main message is, "Fatherhood is very important. Now, back to work, dads." So when you're asking a dad about himself, what's the question? It's always, "So, what do you do?" That's the most important thing. That's how men in our culture define themselves. And certainly, I don't think that men and women shouldn't be working. I think that that's really important, but there's very little balance in our culture, particularly with dads. Your value is your paycheck. The more time you spend at work the better dad you are, because you're very committed to your work, which means you're making money, which means you're bringing stability and security to your family. But I think that if you ask a lot of kids, would you rather have your dad make little less money and see him a little bit more, I think that the answer to that is most kids would say, "Yeah, I'd like to see dad a little bit more, thank you." If you have to take your kid to the doctor's, more dads, more often than not, will say, "Well, I have to go to the doctor's." Because it's not as acceptable to say, "My son needs a doctor's appointment, I need to take him." That's not acceptable behavior in our corporate culture at this point. I think it's so important to have dads as involved in... especially those early years, as much as the moms. Down she goes! Up you get! I think that there's value. When you hold your baby, and you know... what every single little coo sound means. She hates putting on pajamas, and putting on her sleep set. That's a whole world that most dads who are working don't get. They hear a baby crying, "The baby's crying! I don't know, maybe she's hungry. Maybe she pooped in her pants. I have no idea." Uh-oh! The United States is the last industrialized nation not to have paid parental leave for anybody, and it's a travesty. And it's just disturbingly awful. The bottom line is, there is no good time to have a family. It's not like, "Well, now that we have everything in order, and I've fulfilled all of my career achievements, and we have all this money in the bank, and we can just be relaxed, now let's have kids!" Okay, no, it doesn't work that way. If there was 20 years between the ages of 30 and 40, we'd all be set. And then, of course, there's the birth control issue. The kid behind me in the airplane is screaming, why would I ever wanna subject myself to that? That's good birth control for some people. And one of the things that I try to talk about in the film is gender equity, and how important that is, and the idea that mom and dad are equal partners in this, that it's not just the husband who comes home, and, "Where's my steak and my slippers and my paper?" That's a little bit old school at this point. Thirty years ago, if you said, "Well, I don't change diapers," some other dad would go, "Well, of course! You're a dad! Why would you do that? You just go off and work." So there definitely are changes that are happening. I'd like to see those changes happen quicker. So what do you see for the future? The dads of 30 years from now will look at the dads of today as being, as if we were cavemen. This is your kid here, who's uncomfortable, and I, and I'm here to provide this service for him. You know, it's not that I'm saying I enjoy changing diapers, but it would never occur to me to say, "Oh, he needs a diaper changing, I'm going to ignore it hoping someone else comes along to do it for me." That's just idiotic. I'm raising my boy. I want him to be happy and comfortable. So, I wipe his ass for him. You lucky little bastard. And you know what, some day, you'll be wiping mine! Gillian Ranson, a sociology professor at the University of Calgary, studied couples who are "Going against the grain." Whether dad stays home instead of mom, both mom and dad work part time, or even in shifts, to better care for the kids, Gillian found that these couples are leading the way into a future that has better work-family balance and greater gender equality. Life seems to be changing a lot for mothers, but rather less for fathers, so, while women are in paid employment in these increasing numbers, there still seems to be this expectation, this dominant expectation out in the world that mothers, whatever else they're doing, will be ultimately responsible for their families, and fathers, whatever else they're doing, no matter how much they might help in their families, are actually ultimately responsible for financial provision. And so those dominant ideas about what mothers really should be doing and what fathers really should be doing seem to be remarkably persistent, even though the world is changing. My perspective is that mothering, learning how to look after a baby, is something that you learn. And because we set the world up so that mothers are mostly the ones who get this experience, we tend to think, "Oh, well, okay, it tends to be mothers who are the experts here, therefore, it must come naturally." But what I discovered in talking to lots of these dads is that they're getting the experience, they can do it just as well as mothers can. One of the things that happens when you have two parents sort of sharing responsibility, not just sharing, you know, the hard grunge work, the doing the laundry, the running kids around and so on, but sharing the, you know, the planning, and the thinking, and the caring, and the taking responsibility, and the remembering the doctors appointments and all of those things-- when you have two people doing that, the burden on mothers is considerably reduced, with luck, it's halved. You know, right there, the other side of the coin is that it gives fathers opportunities that fathers in past generations often haven't had to develop real emotional connections to their children that make a difference in their lives, you know. * Rub-a-dub * Look at Ava in the sky tub * Rub-a-dub-dub * It's Ava in the sky tub * It used to be, if you kept a child well fed and well clothed and with warmth and shelter and loving parents and loving siblings, that was really all that parents were expected to do. And gradually, additional expectations have been added, so, you know, there was sort of the phase when parents were required to really attend to the child's emotional well-being. So we all got into self-esteem issues and making sure that our children felt, you know, confident and all of that. Now, you know, the latest trend seems to be attending to children's cognitive development as well, the so-called brain research that suggests that if you haven't kind of done all the right things by the time your child's five or six or something, it's lost, you know. And like I said, it drives me crazy. Because most parents can't do it. Who are we kidding, you know? Let's change the rules here. I see couples like the ones in my study as sort of the leading edge of this change. You know, they're representing this change, they're not anomalies, they're leaders, you know, and I think we'll see more and more of them. So I'm determinedly optimistic. Worrying about inequalities that I know exist, but feeling that the best approach is to think positive, to look for change where it's happening, and to celebrate the change that's happening in order to encourage change, because there's no doubt that change is needed. Yeah, I feel like my relationship with Liz, I think that we've, we've done pretty well, I mean, I think we both wish we had more time for each other, but like, I feel like maybe it's a little bit different because we adopted Natalie. I don't know, and we knew we had to be in this together. Like we, I feel like we pulled together more than it's... than it's pushed us apart. And what about seeing Liz as a mother, I mean, you see a whole new dimension in your partner, right? Has that been kind of special? Yeah, actually, that's been really neat, watching her, and she worries about it so much, that she's not doing enough, but I'm like, oh, she does so much for Natalie, and, like, Natalie does so many amazing things, and I think it's because Liz is such a great mom. Like, she is so attentive to all of her needs, she's always doing stimulating games and stuff, and playing with her. Keep looking over at her, I don't want her to... To escape out the front door? I'm glad that many dads have jumped into the trenches, but enough with all the pressure on mothers already. Do we really need higher expectations? Hasn't the bar been raised high enough? This whole intensive mothering thing is alive and kicking and pissing me off. Elisabeth Badinter, a French philosopher and author, argues that the current attitudes towards mothering are making baby the biggest ally of male domination. This keeps baby healthy and strong, and strengthens the bond between mother and child. So would you say sometimes... moms or women are hard on other moms? Yeah, for sure. Depends, I think the more, like, high-strung moms that are putting a lot of pressure on themselves, tend to judge you more, as well. Like, just because that's their way of coping. But like, the more laid back moms, I find, at least I don't feel like they're judging as much. But yeah, moms are hard on moms, like... anything, what you're feeding them, what car seat you have, what... how much they go outside, whether they're wearing mittens and a hat, all those things, pretty much everything you do. But it's not, it's not all moms. It's just people in general. But yeah, some moms sometimes, 'cause they want to do everything right all the time, so then they're a little bit more, like, closed-minded in what is right. So many moms these days devote every waking moment to their kids. This world of constant, vigilant supervision and stimulation looks, honestly, like a giant drag. Do you have to be apple pie when you become a mother? Or is there some beer-and-wings wiggle room? Christie Mellor says, wiggle away, in her book, "The Three-Martini Playdate." People used to say, "So, you wrote 'The Three-Martini Playdate' 'cause you had kids," and it's like, "No, I met other peoples' children, basically." The sort of crazy parenting thing had started happening. In the old days, you would have kids and sort of invite them into your life and have them be a part of your family. And then suddenly, something turned around, and people were having kids and centering their entire lives around their children. A lot of it has to do with the marketing of this kind of parenting perfection, that if, you know, to be a really good mom, you have got to get that $700 stroller, and you have to hire a house-proofing company. "I really care about my child, because I wake up and take them to violin lessons, and then we're going to the Children's Museum afterwards, and then we're gonna have a party for all the kids." I know people who that is what they love doing. And I think that's great, because if you can just stay on the floor and do glitter paintings with your child for hours and hours on end, I'm very impressed by that kind of patience. And I don't possess that kind of patience. It's like, I'm not gonna go to the petting zoo, and have a circus come, and the Batman, and the thing, and the... It's just, I don't see the... my kids can go to other peoples' parties. And it's like, "Mom, there was a petting zoo in the front yard!" It's like, yeah, that's great. For people who are absolutely spooked about the idea of having kids, I kind of wanted to say, you know, try to remember when you were growing up. It wasn't this fraught with anxiety and pressure. We used to be on the street all the time, running around and disappearing, and my mom had no idea where we were. It's like, all right, be back around 7:00 for dinner. And, you know, and now parents feel that they must constantly watch their kids, and I think that's... for if you're considering having kids, that must be a horrifying prospect, to think, "I am no longer gonna have any semblance of the life that I love," and I think that's so not true. She's fishing and feeding Eva. You know, it's not about raising a child, it's about raising the adult that you're gonna have. And I think you'd like to raise the kind of adult that you would like to eventually hang out with. Instead of, oh, this picture of "I am a mother, and I have a child, and I can accessorize like a doll." No, you actually are raising someone that you want to launch out into the world and be a good human being that will contribute and be a nice person. And I think there's way too much guilt put on moms, and not enough encouragement and applause for all you have to do. It's the most thankless job... thankless, low-paying job. It's incredibly rewarding, but it's also, it's like, boy, you know, people don't realize how hard it is. It's a tough job. The idea that you are having to care for another human being is a little daunting, and it should be, and if you aren't daunted by it, there's probably something wrong with you, because you are not gonna have control over everything. And you just have to let go of that. You are not gonna maybe have a perfectly clean house for several years. You may not have a perfect body, or perfect wardrobe, or perfect, you know, anything, for a couple of years. And, nor are you going to have a perfect child. So, if you can just let go of that ahead of time, you're gonna have a much better life with your children. And a much better life in general, you know. And as I've also heard, which is one of my favorite things that people say, "Well, Nicole, she's so cute." I'm like, "What's so great about having kids?" She's like, "It's fun!" She's like, "Everyone talks about it's so awful." She's like, "It's fun! It's so fun!" And she's like, "And you take Christmas, and Thanksgiving, and traditions that you loved, and you make them your own, you know." You make them yours, and that's awesome. I think that's pretty cool. Just think of all your favorite times, right? Your favorite times in your family, and then think of how you like to do it, and like, Mark and I joke, we're like, we're gonna make friends, as in, "make" our own friends, because they have to do what we wanna do. Our friends are like, "No, we don't really do tent camping, we'll stay in the hotel." If you have kids, you're like, "No, you do tent. Because we do tent. And this is your tent. And you're good. No, there's no hot water." "No, no, there's that faucet-- that fountain. Go there. You're good." You know? You may have heard of Lenore Skenazy. Her nickname... "America's worst mom." She has a lot to say about the current culture of parenting, and the importance of free-ranging your kids. About two years ago, my son, who was nine at the time, was asking my husband and me if we would please let him find his own way home, by himself, on the subway, from someplace he hadn't been before. And my husband and I talked about it, and we thought, you know, we're on the subways all the time, we know how safe they are, we know they're bustling, we know he knows how to read a map, and he knows his way around. Okay, we think he's ready. And so, I took him to Bloomingdale's, and when you open the door, outside is the subway. So he took the subway home, got home. He was really happy about it, so were we. That was it, until I didn't have any ideas for a column, and I'm a columnist, that's what I do. And I asked my editor, "I don't know, what if I write about Izzy's subway ride?" And she said, "Okay, you know, local story, whatever." And so I wrote it and it ran in my paper, The New York Sun, and two days later, I was on Today Show, MSNBC, Fox News, with everybody saying, "Why would you do that? Why would you put your son in such a dangerous situation?" I'm like, "You know what? I wouldn't. I love my son. If I thought that he was in real danger, I wouldn't have done that." I think that my city is safer than people think, I think my son is smarter than people believe nine-year-olds are, and, not that he's smarter than other nine-year-olds, it's just, nine-year-olds are more competent than we believe. And I let him do it 'cause I thought he was ready. And that was it, and it started everything. Hip, hip, hurray! My Junior starts going to school today. What I'm suggesting is that the childhood that most of us had, where, you know, we walked to school, and we came home, we had a snack, and we went outside and played, and our moms were not going, like, "Oh, I don't know if I should let him outside, I could never forgive myself," they just let us outside... "Come home for dinner, hon." I'm saying, we can still have that. * With my new pair of britches and fancy tie * * I'm on my way to school * Though I'm just startin' kindergarten * * I'm nobody's fool * We can have that exact same childhood, because times are not less safe than when we were kids, which is something nobody believes, but the statistics are out there. Canada is safer than it was in the '70s and '80s, America is safer, Australia is safer, England is safer, we've been going through this crime drop from the mid-'90s, which has gone completely unnoticed, because the crime is not dropping on Nancy Grace. The crime is not dropping on CNN, the crime is not dropping on Law & Order. But crime in the real world is dropping, so get away from the TV and go out in that real world where your kids can really have a childhood. You don't have to take it away from them. I bet you can't see me 'cause I'm behind the tree. I can still see you. I can see you from here right now. What interests me is how people think that they are being smart and proactive when they think... "worst first," that's my new phrase, is "worst first thinking." This woman who was interviewing me said she'd just been talking to her friend, who'd been at the grocery, and he was walking down one aisle, and he saw a mom with her little kid, and so he waved, "Hi," you know, "Hi," very nice moment. Saw 'em again in the next aisle, "Oh, you again, hi!" Third aisle, the manager asked him to leave. What's the assumption there? The assumption is that, not that this is a nice guy, people are shopping, people run into each other in the aisles, no, the assumption is that this guy is stalking the child? What's he gonna do, steal the child while the mother is reaching for a can of peas? Or butter up the mom so that he can come and become the babysitter? I mean, what wild things would have to happen for that to be anything other than a nice moment? But in these frenzied "worst first" times, we really are thinking like crazy people. We are thinking of all men as potential pedophiles, and all children as potential victims, all the time. Judgment turns out to be one of the biggest impediments to free-ranging your kids, because even if you think your kid is ready to walk to school, you know, she's seven, or eight, or whatever, what about the neighbor who's driving their kid to school? She's going to think that you don't care. And you worry that everybody is going to judge you, and it's really hard to divorce yourself from the big worry, that something bad will happen. I'm gonna be the one trying to explain to Anderson Cooper, really, I was just going in to check on the soup, and I came out, it's like, "Why were you checking on the soup?" You just feel there's going to be no sympathy. * Though I'm just startin' kindergarten * * I'll be graduatin' soon! * And we don't consider getting into a car dangerous, even though that is the number one way children die in America, is as passengers, even in their car seats, in cars. But we don't think, "Oh my God, what kind of mother I am! I'm putting my kid in the car! What if... I could never forgive myself, I don't like to think this way but I can't stop myself. What if he dies?" We don't do that every time we drive to the orthodontist. You know? But we do that every time we let 'em play on the front lawn. Because we've decided the front lawn is dangerous, even though the chances of a stranger abduction are minuscule, and the chances of dying in a car are also very small, but 40 times larger than them dying at the hands of a stranger. I think a lot of our fears are market driven, because if you can create a fear, then you can sell us something to assuage it. There was a Verizon commercial that shows a mom and her kid, who is at least as big as me, like a 14-year-old girl, at the top of an escalator at the mall, and the girl is going down the escalator to meet her two friends, and it says, "Now is your big chance, Mom. It's your daughter's first time alone at the mall. Don't you wanna know where she goes?" And it shows, yay, Verizon can track her like a crazy stalker from Abercrombie to the Gap, back to Abercrombie, to, you know, the cinnamon bun place. There's always a market for creating, like, a niggling worry at the back of your head, "Was I supposed to be doing more?" And then, "Yes, you were! Buy this!" It's like, oh, I just have to buy this and now I'm a good mom? "Yes, now you're a good mom!" Okay. And so you buy it. It seems strange, but lawsuits are changing childhood in that anytime something bad happens to a kid, a parent can sue. A child in West Virginia fell off a swing, you know, it happens, broke his leg. The parents sued the park district, the park distract had to pay, I can't remember how many thousands of dollars, because they were "negligent," because they had swings, God forbid. And so, what they did to prevent this from happening again and prevent their county from going bankrupt, is they took out all the swings. There are no more swings in that county, because one kid fell off and broke his leg. And then there are places that look at that and think, proactively, "We don't even want that first lawsuit. Let's get rid of our swings now." You know, there's toys that are recalled because there's a dot of lead in the pupil of Barbie's eye, and, you know, if a child ate the heads of, you know, every Barbie in America, they could get elevated blood levels! There's no sense of proportion, there's no sense that a teeny, tiny, negligible risk is just that. Just try to bring back a little normalcy. One of those hours that you were gonna watch some terrifying show where the child is, you know, raped, tattooed, and dragged from the swamp, and then the maggots are examined too, and then the maggots are raped, you know, one of those shows... don't watch it. Go outside in the neighborhood you chose to raise your kid in, and be a part of the neighborhood. So in today's world, as a mother, you know, we're competing with each other more than ever. There's those "Mommy groups," there's those, you know, like, we have to all, "What are you doing? Are you signing your child up for the Fall programs, or, are you, is your child enrolled in this, are you enrolled in that?" And people are comparing. Not only do parents over-fear for their kids' safety, they now obsess about their success in the future. $25,000 preschools? Oh, my. But while this trend may be en vogue, it is not doing parents or kids any favors. Hara Marano, editor-at-large for Psychology Today and author of "A Nation of Wimps" did some investigating that will make you think twice about tutoring for tots. And I spoke to over 400 people on the frontlines of campus counseling centers, and they all said the same thing. All of these kids lack coping skills, and they break down really, very easily when they hit a minor impediment. They have no idea how to cope. And they all said that the reason they have no coping skills is that their parents took all the lumps and bumps out of life for them. Now, you have to understand, this is a problem of the middle class and above. This is not a problem with the working class. In fact, they have, in a sense, the opposite problem. And that's the tragedy of it, of course, because we're giving all the attention to kids who don't really need so much attention, and we could afford to give a lot of our attention to the kids who need more attention. It's all the outgrowth of parental anxiety. Parents are anxious that their kids will need to succeed, and won't succeed, without their constant monitoring, without their constant input, even taking over tasks. They're very anxious for their kids, they don't trust their kids, they don't trust childhood, they don't trust any other parents, and they're terrified that "My kid will be left behind." Literally a true story. It was Christmas Day, my neighbor, who's a grown daughter of my downstairs neighbors, and she was wearing one of those contraptions on her legs, what they call a walking boot. She said to me, "Oh, I've just been in the emergency room for two and a half hours." She said, "I've never been separated from my daughter this long." She's four. Four years old, and she's never been away from her daughter for two hours. That's pathetic. I was hoping it was a fad. I have to tell you, I'm very disappointed that it's not. It seems to be getting much more deeply entrenched, and just accepted that this is the way it has to be. With really very intelligent women not stopping to examine the premise or think about what their kids might be capable of. And the other thing that struck me was how judgmental they were of other women. Every woman was judgmental of the next woman, of what she was feeding her baby, of the choices that she had made. And I think, ironically, that this is a consequence of the new position that women are in, that they do have a lot of choices, but no one feels 100 % comfortable with the choices that she has made. That's one of the ironies of having more choice. Remember, if you've been professionally trained, you've gotten an MBA, and you, you're really a high-powered professional, and you, you're rewarded for deploying those skills, although you're clueless that those skills have nothing to do with parenting and raising kids, you've learned everything you know from experts and from textbooks, and you're taking that same mindset and applying it to your kids. So what you have happening is this very grim, joyless approach to parenting. And I am not surprised if it turns lots of other women off parenting. How could it not? Instead of sitting back, knocking down a glass of sherry... Whoo! ...and saying, you know, there's a lot of on-the-job learning to parenting. Well, there's not a whole lot of fun in anxiety, I can assure you. The only person who has fun with anxiety is Woody Allen. "Well, Terra, here is the letter "I've been writing in my head for weeks. "I do not intend to influence you, "it is more that I would feel negligent "if in many years' time, you might feel "that I hadn't shared with you my own experience adequately. "You see, with children, it's easy. "You love beyond any boundaries, "there are no negotiations, no compromises. "There is this complete love. "This spiritual connection that makes you love "and protect beyond anything. "Watching a child grow and develop "is the most amazing thing one can ever witness. "It is a delight, a laugh like no other, "a challenge, a stimulation, a constant source of wonder, "like no other thing on earth. "You don't have to read anything or take courses "on parenting, it is natural. "It's obvious. "You love your children and your greatest wish "is for their happiness. "Everything you do falls into place, it makes sense. "They come into your world and you share "your joys and your adventures, and all your days with them. "Simply know that parenting has been and is "the best of life for me and for your father. "So many more times and so much larger than any other thing. "We made mistakes as parents, but because we always "loved you, things always worked out. "I don't think that it is any more difficult than that. "Anyway, probably enough said. "I love you, as you well know, "and I know also that you love me... us, too. "It is the way of things, "and it is the very best miracle. Mom." Phillip Longman wrote "The Empty Cradle." He thinks we're not paying attention to the fact that we've created a climate that is discouraging women from having children. We just don't think about what this means for our individual or collective futures. Definitely baby food for thought. Right now, the world faces this gigantic megatrend, which is that in countries rich and poor, in Christian countries, Muslim countries, both hemispheres, wherever you look, people are having far fewer children than before. There's no exceptions. People are not even having enough children to replace the population over time. And this seems to be the trend on which humanity as a whole is coursing. Why it's happening? Big question. What are the implications of its happening? Even bigger question. But it's no doubt that it's happening. This phenomenon has spread from rich Western countries to poorer developing countries. And what that means is, whereas France, the United States, other Western countries got a chance to get rich before they got old, now we're seeing many developing countries getting old before they get rich, and getting old much faster than any Western country ever did. Mexico, for example, will age as much in the next generation as France did in 140 years. Well, I think it's important to emphasize the positive, from the vantage point of the early 1970s, it looked like world population today might be as much as 12 billion, as opposed to the 6.7 that it actually is. If we had stayed on that course, we would face some very, very serious problems in feeding the world and coping with the environmental consequences of that kind of population boom. But as often happens, when you wish for things, they come true, and you have to deal with the consequences. As China has produced fewer and fewer children, it's produced more and more pollution. And this would seem to be an iron law, the countries that first begin to have this fertility decline tend to, in the short term, do economically better, and so, with fewer children, each remaining adult consumes more. Also, in a world of aging money that otherwise might go to building high-speed rail or electric cars or other things, now has to go to pensions and healthcare. All of a sudden your economy doesn't seem to grow as fast as it used to, the tax receipts don't come in like they used to, the cost of entitlements for the elderly continues to grow, and you find countries like Italy, Greece, Spain, Ireland, you know, in economic extremes. If you think of a train struggling to get up a hill, it's got the force of gravity trying to push it down, and it's got the force of all that steam power trying to push it up. The gravity is like mortality, and the energy in the engine is like fertility. And so long as fertility is somewhat greater than mortality, that engine will still go up the hill. But what happens when the engine suddenly runs out of coal? It still continues to go up the hill for a little bit, right? But a slower and slower pace. That's kinda where we are right now. Human population is still growing, but a slower and slower pace. But eventually, you come to a point where it's neither going up nor down. And then all of a sudden it starts going down. And faster and faster. And that is, that is the population dynamic. This partial exception to the trend of having fewer children is among the religious. So whether we're talking about fundamentalist Christians, fundamentalist Muslims, or the ultra-Orthodox in Judaism, these are where the great exceptions lie. This is where the five or six person family is still the norm. Everybody's having fewer children, but less so among the religious. And so gradually, we see a fundamentalist future unfolding. The fundamental vulnerability of modernism in all of its forms is its sterility. Today, if you look at a typical family tree, right, you've got the matriarch and the patriarch, and then it branches out all over here. So when you come to Thanksgiving, there's all kinds of people there that have this relationship to you of nephew, cousin, uncle, aunt. In a one-child family world, there's no such things as uncles and aunts, there's no such things as cousins and nephews. There's only grandparents and parents. And the grandparents die, and maybe your parents do too. In any case, that's a very slender thread, right, and you have comparatively very little social capital to draw on, in not just raising your kids, but navigating life in general, right. It becomes a very lonely world. When everything is so great in the present, much thanks to the past, are we in danger of forgetting to invest in the future? In a culture that emphasizes production and consumption above all else, have we downgraded the importance of family to the point of endangering the species? Are we so used to toeing the party line and following the leader that we've forgotten to carve our own paths and create our own destinies? And what if what we are so afraid to miss is responsible for making us miss the most? I mean, I think sometimes people look at me as being a... you know, sort of one of those detached mothers who's like, got the martini and the cigarette, and it's like, no, darling, go off and play in the other room, you know, Mommy's tired, or whatever. I mean, maybe I'm not the kind of mom who bakes cookies and throws birthday parties like some mothers do, but I am a mom, still. If you don't feel like you fit into some sort of mold of "mom," that doesn't mean you're going to be a bad mom. You know, I think our kids are pretty, pretty good kids. We live in a post-modern world where our communication is on the internet, on the telephone, watching the screen, whether it's our phone, or, you know, movie screens, whatever it is, it's very broken up, and it's very fragmented. And there's a detached experience that I think a lot of people go through, and I think the antidote to that feeling of detachment is family. One thing I deeply appreciate about being a parent is that it's a very humbling thing. And it certainly allows you to have a perspective on professional life. Because in the end, you know, career success doesn't compete with the meaning of... the human connection, with a child or a partner. Okay, what I love about the game Boggle is that everybody's looking at the same little configuration of letters on this little board, and everybody sees something differently. And it just... I love playing it, not necessarily to be a high scorer, but to see what other words that other people saw that I didn't see, from their different perspective. And that's the beauty of having kids. It's being able to enjoy... their totally different perspective. Yeah, I think having a kid means that you're tuned into a whole different dimension in life. You learn that you have to slow down. You learn that you can't control things. You learn that you have to be attentive to peoples' needs, it's a complete change of gears, complete change of gears. As I reflect back on my life... the one son that I have in my life, the one child, is probably the best single thing that ever happened to me in my life. And I think it's been a source of tremendous fulfillment and it's hard for us to imagine ourselves being 50-something as we are, and not having any tie to the next generation. You realize that who they are is everyone who's come before them, and what a continuum that is. And you also realize that you're much more vested in the future, that you care much more about what's gonna happen shorter term and longer term, that you're more invested, therefore, in how the world unfolds. Imagine sitting on the couch, next to your child, just talking to them, looking in their eyes, and hearing them, you know, hearing a five-year, seven-year, eight-year-old, converse. Does that sound, what, mundane? And imagine feeling warm and enjoying it and hearing those things as interesting. There is a whole emotional aspect to raising children, to living family life. I was at the mall yesterday, and you know those big gumball machines, where the gumballs come all the way down? Well, a little girl was there, with her mom, and the mom was kneeling with her, and they put the coin in, and the gumball was coming around, the little girl was looking on, and when the gumball landed, the girl, the little girl said, "Thank you, Mommy!" And I was so touched because I thought, nobody ever talks to you like a child does. Nobody ever appreciates life like a child does. You get a chance, with a child, to re-see life. And we get a little on-edge, and we get a little bitter as we get older, and what a child brings is that wonder back into your life. And unless you've had a child, you don't know how enormous the difference is, but it's the depth of love that you cannot know any other way, and you can't put that into words. It's ephemeral. It's like a beautiful sky. The end.
