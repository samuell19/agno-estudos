Your dumbass brother is here. Did you let him in? No. I'm gonna have a smoke. What the hell did he want? Nothing... He just wanted to say goodbye. Good. He needs to mind his own business. He's not in our business James. That's a lie! It's not! I know it is. I'm here trying to provide for you and you don't appreciate a damn thing! James... Damnit Olivia, let's go! Gonna be a legendary fire huh? Yes sir, it would be. I'm looking for some firewood. My nephew normally gets it for me but he hasn't been around. Yeah, there were some trees up by Wildwood I thought I'd clean up. But I don't have a use for all this though. I can give you some if you'd like. Oh I'll pay for it. No, really, it's okay. No really. I insist. Here give me your number and I'll give you a call. You live close by? Yeah, I have a house a few miles away but This is going straight up to my cabin. Awesome. Alright, I'll be in touch. Take care. Olivia! Stop! Listen to me! Listen Olivia! Get back in the car! Listen, listen! You're not listening! Listen. Listen to me. Hey. Hey! Is everything okay miss? No! Everything is fine. Is that true? Everything is fine. If you don't mind, I'd like to talk with her. Do you need help? What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't like the way you're talking with her. I don't give a rats ass on how you think im talking to her. This is none of your business! Hey! Whats going on? This asshole is getting in business he should stay out of! He's helping me. Do you know him? She's my girlfriend! Can you please take me somewhere? Where do you need to go? No! Olivia please! I don't care just anywhere but here... Everything is gonna be alright! You're insane! She loves me! She's my responsibility! Call the cops? You got it. Good luck with her! She's crazy! Don't start with me. You're safe now. It's okay. Where should I take you? I'm not sure yet... Is there someone we can call? Something I can do? I just want to run away... What's holding you back? I've tried leaving before and he just sucks me right back in. What if you just went someplace that he couldn't find you? A hotel? I don't have any money all I have are the clothes on my back... I live close by... Why don't we stop there and figure things out? I loved him before... I mean I did. What do you think I should do? Do whats best for you. The offer still stands. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't even know your name. Thomas. Nice to meet you Thomas. Thanks. He wasn't always like that you know. He used to be really sweet. I understand. He would just get so mean... He'd hit me and choke me... and spit on me... Nobody deserves that type of abuse. He just... He had this temper. I know he felt bad afterwords. I know he did. I can't believe my life got to this point. I always thought I was stronger than this. Can I tell you a story? When I was growing up, my dad was a lot like your ex. He was a great guy around most people. A lot of people liked him. But... When he was alone with me... That's horrible. It's okay. I learned a valuable lesson. One that most people don't get in their life. You know those movies where Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington saves a girl that's in trouble? I wanted to be that for my mom. and one day I waited for my dad to come home he was upset about something. I watched him push her down. That was the last time he ever hit her, or I again. What happened? That was actually the last time I ever saw him. You know you really did save your mom. I bet she really loves you. She did. Unfortunately she had too many demons left over from that. Oh. I'm so sorry. The point is, heroes can exist. It's really beautiful here. Thanks. I had it built for my mom and I to live here. What do you do for a living if you don't mind me asking? Software. I wrote and sold an online educational program. I always wanted to live on a lake. A few years back I bought a cabin up north on a more secluded lake. I always wanted to live on a lake too. Maybe someday you can. I don't know, I... Just want to make it through this first. Well if you need anything I'm here for you. Let's eat. Thank you. I hope I'm not a burden. You're welcome. You're not. I got you some sweats. Can I get you anything else? No. You've done enough. Thank you. Holler if you need anything. OLIVIA! Good morning. M-morning... I made you some breakfast. Thought I'd bring some up for you. Thanks... I'm not sure if you've come up with any plans yet but I was thinking and You're welcome to stay here a while, as long as you want or need. Well... I couldn't imagine what Jame's would do if he ever saw you again. As you said. You said you always wanted to live on a lake. Stay a while. I don't know... I just woke up. Well just think about it. I've been in your situation before. I found my way out. Thank you for breakfast. You're welcome. Make yourself at home. How was breakfast? Is there someone here? I thought I heard talking... It wasn't about James... was it? Oh. No. No. I was uh... Just going over some home improvements in my head. I can get pretty passionate. Sorry if I disturbed you. Well I've given it a lot of thought and... I think you're right. I'm not in a good enough place to leave quite yet. I thought my cooking might convince you. I mean as long as I'm not bothering you. No you're not. A few more of my amazing meals and you might never leave. I like helping you Olivia. Maybe I'll repay you by making some of my famous burnt toast. Hey! If you ever get bored and want something to do I've got all these paint supplies that used to be my mom's. How'd you know I always wanted to paint? Hmmm? I mean I've explored it I just never know what to do. Give it a try. I've gotta run some errands I'll be back in a few hours. Okay. Paint a flower. Hey! Nice to see your face when I get home. How was it? Quiet? Yeah, it was really good. Hungry? So how'd the painting go? Not well. What? I thought you were going to be painting a flower? I started a flower. Oh, I've been thinking I wanna let my mom know that I'm safe. Okay. Do you want to call her? No. I mean James has my phone and I'm afraid if I call her on your phone he'll find a way to track me. I actually wrote her a letter. Yeah, want me to mail it? Do you have an envelope? Of course! Thanks. But it's actually good to be away from James right now. I want you to know, I don't think I'll go back with James. Before you get upset, let me explain mom... I want a new life. I've tried to tell you this before and you've never taken it well. I feel I finally have the courage to make this step. We're making some progress. Sleep well? You're quiet. I was about to head out but I have breakfast here for you. I'll be back later? For dinner? And I'll mail that letter. I think you're really brave. I know how hard that must be to stand up to your mom. I'm proud of you. I don't know. Maybe it's a step in the right direction. I'm just worried about her attachment to people from her old life. Maybe I'm overreacting. Hey, do you like music? Yeah, James never really liked my taste though. Classical? How'd you know that? Just a guess. I miss the live orchestra. Used to go to a lot of shows huh? My brother used to take me. What was your favorite instrument? I love the flute. It's just so airy and free. How about you? Did you ever just watch the conductor? He orchestrates all of those instruments at once. That's where the real beauty is. That's where the music is made. I never really thought about it that way. I just wish my brother would take me again. I miss it. You aren't one to make plans, are you? I just don't like being a bother. You're no bother. You say that but I've been here two days and I... I don't know, I just, I need to get home. You are welcome here Olivia. I don't know. James is probably out there looking for me and if I go home before he finds me he might just forgive me this time. Are you saying you want to go back to him? I don't know. He's home. Let's talk about this tomorrow. You don't think I should? No! Let's talk about it tomorrow. Okay. I told you. She's talking about leaving. I've gotta step in here. We gotta get back to a clean slate. Sorry about that... All finished? Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Is that really how you want to live your life? In a world where everything is your fault? I know you wanna go back to him but, I just don't think you're ready for that yet. I have good memories with him you know. James. From the beginning. You need to stop romanticizing him. Those memories are a virus. When a computer has a virus, you just delete it. What do you mean? Well sometimes you just need to wipe the hard drive. Start over fresh. Program it just the way you want. Sometimes there's just stuff in there that does no one any good. That's enough about that. Let's go relax. How are you so good at this? Eh, practice. You're doing good. Zeds? Yeah. It's the plural form of the letter "Z". And based on that logic, it would appear I'm going to win. More? No I'm... It's late and I think that's enough game for me. You sure? Yeah you're clearly better at this than I am. I was talking about the wine but I guess that answers that question. Do you mind if I ask you some more questions Olivia? What happened? I guess I had a nightmare... About what? James. He was running after me and I couldn't get away. Okay. It's okay... Tomorrow's gonna be a better day. I promise. Try to get some sleep. Just a dream. I don't think she remembers. It's fine. She still hasnt made one decision. I rushed things a little last night. But she won't remember it. She thinks it was a dream. Good morning. Did you get back to sleep? Yeah. I'm making omelets. You want one? Sure. Why don't you cut up some onions? Here. Hold it like this. You okay? Yeah. That wine was a big hit last night. You really guzzled that down. Might have to break out another bottle tonight. I feel really grimy. Onions will do that to you. Do you mind if I go take a shower? You know you don't have to ask me to do things around here. Hey! I'm going to help you through this. I've been through all of this. I know what's going through your head. I'm here to help. Shower takes a minute to warm up. No. The knife isn't a big enough decision. She's still too passive. She'd never actually use it. She's just irrational. We have a lot more work to do. Plus I haven't even taken out the threat. You said it yourself. Authoritative action required. We need more time. From burnt toast to delicious omelet onions! I'm impressed. Why did you read my letter? What? I heard you. Reading it out loud. Who were you talking to? No, no. You don't understand. I don't get what's going on anymore. You were helping me. Why are you always on the phone and who are you talking to? Why are you talking about me? You don't understand. I'm trying to protect you. I told I talk to myself and I'm just trying to figure out the best way to help you. I have a lot of stationary paper around the house and it has my address at the bottom. Very light, subtle grey, in the footer. The envelope was sealed. I had to open the envelope to confirm and verify that it had my address on it and it did. But then why were you reading it out loud? You said that you didn't want your mom to know where you were so, I thought I would try to help. I had to dictate it into an email so I could send it... I'm sorry. I should have told you. I'm trying to protect you okay? Okay. I've gotta go. Have you re-run the probabilities? Good. I'll push her more tonight. Sorry. Didn't make it home for lunch. Did you eat? No. Of course. You must be hungry then. Yeah. Good. All we did was go backwards. She's co-dependent on me now. She won't even eat unless I make her food. We need to reprogram without the safety protocols. I'll do it tomorrow. You said you were hungry. Foods still out. Cook something. Oh hey! Good morning. Good morning. I see you didn't clean up the kitchen last night. Or even eat. I lost my appetite. What are you doing down there? Nothing. Thomas, I think I'm ready to go home now. You're gonna leave your hero already? I'll be back. Hello? Olivia? Who is this? Authoritative action... Who are you talking to? No one, I thought I heard a noise. Thomas I don't know what's going on but I think I'm really ready to go home now. It's fine. I'm sure James would love to have you back. I did my best to save you but I guess when people want something and they finally get it, they don't want it anymore. I'm really grateful and I promise I won't get back with James. I just I need to go and live my own life. Well in that case, I guess it's time we celebrate your independence. I'll grab the wine. Thomas? Oh good, you're awake. Come sit. Should be long enough. Sorry I had to do that. I was worried about you. This might be a little jarring to you, but you were starting to scare me. You took a knife to your room, and you were trying to contact people who have hurt you before. You're safer here. You can't keep me here. People will notice I'm missing. You just wrote a letter explaining why you're missing. Thomas you can't do this. I'm saving you Olivia. Spend a few days here and you'll come to your senses. I wanted to stay at the house but we couldn't. You tried to leave your second day. Those weren't dreams. How? How do I not remember that? I had to give you something while we were at the house. You drugged me... Thomas you can't do that this is kidnapping! I would be hurt, but you don't understand all the good things I've done for you. You threatened me. I never threatened you. I thought you were helping me. If you thought I was helping you, why did you take a knife to your room? I just left my abusive boyfriend. He's out looking for me I know it. It's my job to make you feel safe. You have no job when it comes to me. It's my job to help anyone who's being mistreated. You're lucky to have me. I had to go through all of this alone. No wonder your mother killed herself. I did what I had to do to save my mom. Now I'm doing what I have to do to save you. Please... Please you have helped me. Please let me go? There's a bigger picture here. It's more than just you getting back to your normal life. Thomas! If you calm down, you won't need to be restrained but if you don't the situation won't change. Goodnight Olivia. Hey! Little help? Guess not. Breakfast? What do you want from me? Right now? Cut up this onion. I know you like them in your omelets. While you're doing that, I'll set the table. I thought I just taught you how to hold a knife. Come here. You know you're gonna have to eat. You have to make that decision yourself. What? You're not going to make that decision for me too? You have to trust me. The world works in mysterious ways. You're awful. Please stop saying that. You are. You're worse than James. At least he loved me deep down. I wouldn't be trying to help you if I didn't care about you. You don't even know me. You graduated highschool in 2013 with the highest GPA in your class. You were set for greatness until you met James. He messed up your life. Your mom's name is Nancy, your dad's name is Jeff. He left her when you were young. You have a brother 3 years older than you, Charlie. Growing up he made most of the decisions. You wanted to be a lawyer, and you're still looking into it but you're not assertive enough to make that decision. I do care Olivia. I need to check on something. Thomas' Voice* (I leanred that I can be the hero) (Saves the girl that's in trouble) (You want to start over right?) (When a computer has a virus...) (You just delete it.) James... Get washed up. I folded your clothes, they're in the dresser. When you're done I'll put your restraints on. You want me to play your game? Okay. This doesn't make any sense. I trust the data... I just... It's never been wrong before. Can you run it again with updated information? Sorry you had to see that out there today. I understand. I promise you... This is all for your own good. If you just wouldn't have run away. I know. For real, now that James is gone I see what you're doing. I am able to have a future and relationships and a career. I'm not going to run away again. I understand why you want to keep me restrained, but the chains are really uncomfortable when I sleep. I'm glad you're finally seeing it. I can take them off tonight if it will help you sleep better. Now that you know there's no point in running. No where to go, no one around. Thank you Thomas. I'm gonna go to bed. Goodnight Thomas. Goodnight. We'll get out. We'll get out. We'll get out. We'll get out. You're up early. Sorry if I startled you, I forgot I need to be more careful. It's fine. You sure there is nothing I can get for you today? No I'm good. Okay. You know I don't want to do this. I understand. But you really don't have to I promise. I have nothing left to go back to. I'm gonna have to lock all the doors to outside today. I understand. I'll be back. What the hell is this? Let me explain. How do you know all of this? How do you know everything about me? Let me sit. An educational program? What do you actually do? I wasn't lying. I wrote an educational program. Is that what this is? After the events that occured with my family I knew I had to do something about abuse. So I wrote an algorithm for artificial intelligence. It identifies habits, situations, needs. Needs? Companies interested in big data sets wanted my algorithm. So I sold it to them for a fairly low price. But in exchange I got access to their database of people. So I can better identify whose being abused, so I can help them. Help them? You kidnap them... How many people have you done this to? None! You were a special case. Typically the A.I. just handles it itself. It contacts authorities, family members, schedules appointments, therapy sessions... What about me? It didn't make my life magically better... Like I said, you were a special case. What does that mean? Nothing the algorithm did could help you. You're too passive. You need to be willing and wanting to be helped. I don't understand. THIS is it's way of helping you. You stalked me. You stalked all those people... I help those people! I came all the way out here just to help you. You stalked me. Yes. I knew where you'd be. And I knew James would make a scene. I knew I could rescue you at that gas station. That's all I was there for. To rescue you, Olivia. I don't want my life decided by a computer. You have to let me go. I am making a decision right now, I opt out. Take me off your list. See? Progress. I knew it would help. I was right all along. Would you like a s'more? I'll assume that's a yes. You're always changing. You didn't have access to technology when you were at my house So I had to update the A.I. myself. Then the night you asked to go back with James... The night you drugged me, chased me down and dragged me inside? The odds were getting lower of you surviving the abuse. I had no other choice. Then you took the knife... That threw the algorithm out of wack. You made a decision! You were on the right track but then you wrote the letter. Reaching out to those that have hurt you. Like my mom? She was identified as a threat. What did you do to her? I do what the algorithm tells me will work. Did you kill your father too? Back then I didn't have the A.I. but now I do. It has data on almost every human on the planet. Web searches, browsing history, habits. It knows you. It doesn't know me, you don't know me. You'll see. It will work. I don't know when you'll realize that this is what's best for you but you will. The perfect golden s'more. I trust I don't have to restrain you anymore. You know this is what's right... Hope you don't mind I showed up a little early. Yeah no worries! Crazy stuff at the gas station huh? That guy just drove off, I bet we'll never hear from him again. Yeah probably not... Bring something to load the wood into? Yeah we can put it in the back of my truck. Perfect. Actually I'll take you out to the wood pile. Let me grab my coat real quick. Nice place you've got here. Thanks. You know, it's really hard to find. All these dirt roads and woods. But when I saw your truck, I knew I'd found the place. You know I knew there was a lake out here but I had no idea there was houses on it. This has to be really nice and peaceful out here. Mmmhhmmm. How about we go get that wood? Yeah. I wonder if there are any other houses for sale...- Sorry about that. What are we bringing an ax for? You never know. HELP! Help me please help me!!! Please help me please!! Help!!! I'll be right back. I'm coming! Please! Help me please!!! Help me!!! Thomas please... Is that the girl from the gas station? Yeah she uh.... Her boyfriend did a number on her. She's been having bad nightmares and I'm just trying to help her out. Should we, uh, get you to the wood pile? Sure... Olivia! Olivia. Olivia! Olivia! Olivia. You know things about me you shouldn't know. Not until you can comprehend all of this. I've heard enough. You don't know what's good for me. The A.I. does. Your little A.I. you can't play God Thomas! Can't you see it's working? Would old Olivia have said any of that? Come back with me. Let's wait it out. I don't fully understand it's plan but this is what's best for you. Maybe it was. Olivia! Thomas, you will let me go. I can't do that. I don't want to shoot you. Olivia, this is not what it's plan is for you. I don't know, I don't feel very passive right now. Olivia. Thanks for coming back to get me. I knew there was something wrong when I saw you at the cabin. Should we go to the police? No. It's taken care of. I'm so sorry I never did anything about James. I mean it's my fault, I should of told you. I had never spoken up. You know, now that I think about it. I think James was just lost. He needed something, someone to control and I let him. What are you going to do now? I guess that's up to me huh? You should start looking at law schools again. I don't think so, I mean, I have a few things I have to take care of here first. Oh hey, I got us tickets to the orchestra downtown tonight. You did? I did.
