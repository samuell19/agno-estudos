- Go on, love. - Hello. Rioux-Clément family. Good. Follow me. Hello, hello. Are you Jade? - Yes. - Come with me. FAMILY SHOW Despite 17 years together, 2 kids, when he gave it to me, he was like a kid. We could've waited. Ruin the best day of your life? But every anniversary will be the date... Shh. It's just fate. Life goes on. I forgot to cover the mirror. - What do you need? - White. Whatever. It's tradition, and it was his favourite colour. - Oh, no. - Yes, really. Will you help? Mum, quick, grandpa's here! Fix the trestles properly. So that Félix is comfortable. My condolences, Hermeline. All my best wishes, Mayi. Don't worry. Have fun. It's good to see you. - Hello lovelies! - Hello. Darling! Isn't my wife just gorgeous? For the prettiest physiotherapist, and the best coach! We won this cup for you, doc! For the wonderful woman who cares for, and inspires us. - For Mayi, hip hip... - Hurrah! That's it! Long live the newlyweds! The coach's dad is on form. - What are you doing here? - I promised Mayi I'd be discreet. Wearing that hat? Follow me. - Dad's annoying everyone. - What's he doing? Always be faithful. He's just emotional. Eh? - He's emotional. - Right, in good times and in bad. Jade's sulking. She's in the shed. - A kiss! - Come here, baby. - Mum? - No, it's only me. Why hide? You're fed up with your parents' wedding? It's a bit weird being at your parents' wedding. Not as bad as burying grandpa. And there'll be lots to eat. I wish it was just family, but the handball team's here. But there'll be loads to eat all the same. Trust you. Look at this. *Bravo! It's the last heat I want to be on Family Show and sing and dance. - What? - Wait. Singing with your parents? - You do nothing with them. - It's with Hermeline. Not a chance. But she said yes. My grandma will never do it. Grandpa just died. Félix lived with his grandma when the devil still wore short trousers. To Mantitine, he was the prettiest baby in Martinique. - Crick! - Crack! His mum and his dad told him if he ate too much, he'd end up fat. - Ye Crick! - Ye Crack! Instead of going on a diet, Félix joined the police... Hermeline, look. - Ye misticrick! - Ye misticrack! One fine day, miss Hermeline's eyes met Félix's eyes. - Ye crick! - Ye crack! Félix was blessed with two beautiful children. - Ye misticrick! - Crack! Ye misticrack! Firmin, their fine son had a good future in the police, and Marie-Aimée, the lovely tigress... Silence. Silence! Oh! Silence! Now for the tale of Mayi and Bastien's life. Come on then. Get up on the table. It's better there. Ye crick! - What's that? - You say "ye crack". I talk and you say "crack" or "ye crack". Ah, I see. Bastien failed at school, he cared more about his muscles. - Crick! - Crack! Then Mayi came from the other side of the world. All alone in her lovely sarong, but he was busy with her hair that smelt of oil. - Crick. - Crack! But grandpa and grandma took her in. Just meant to be an adopted sister, but she was so beautiful and bright that Bastien didn't understand her. Have you quite finished? So he gave his sweetheart a kiss, and Mika was born. Ye crick. Ye crack! Félix enjoyed life... Mum, who are those schemers? 2nd, 3rd, and 4th on the board. That's tradition. There's one missing too. But my claim's legitimate. Say goodbye to him if you wish, but don't drink that. She was meant to stay away. Do something. I can't throw the husband's mother out. It's all in the past. - My dad's being buried. - And his son married. It's an awful day, my daughter's not here. She'll get here. Don't know when, but she'll come. I know it's your job. Always on call, never taking any time off. - Baby. - What? Hello? You left without letting me know, as usual. But this time, you'll have to wait for me. Yes, Firmin, it all went well. Everyone came and I honoured dad's memory. What? Give back what? Mum's flat? She doesn't want to move. You didn't even bother coming. Don't tell me you couldn't leave. You're a cop, not a lifeguard. Stop there, Firmin. Don't play head of the household. No one can replace dad. What? Tell her she's old and alone. It'll cheer her up. How will I manage? You did everything. Now what do I do? Hairdresser's model? He left nothing, didn't he? You knew your father. But I'm not going to let it defeat me. Of course not. You can live here. Go and get your stuff. Stop. That's how it's going to be. There. This is your home. I know I can find a solution. They're great. Thank you! Very good. Yes. So who's who? Grandma Hermeline, and I'm Jade. Jade Rioux and Hermeline Clément. From the same family? Doesn't it show? We are in spirit. Jade's like a granddaughter. So you don't understand Family Show? Family? So where are your families? They're stuck. In every way. Sorry, this show is all about families, they get to win a large car and a family holiday. They've understood. There must be a way to get your families on board. You clearly don't know them. Félix can't leave me now. Félix? Who's Félix? My husband. He's dead. He's in here. - Family. - What? Look, I'm sorry. If it was just me, I'd take you and Félix. But rules are rules. We must have them. They're great. I like your enthusiasm, but still... She's with a child that isn't hers, and a husband who's dead. No way. It's for the man she loved. OK. We'll give you a chance. To take part, you must fill in these forms. Your families must sign. Everyone. - I need them in 24 hours. - 48. Let's say 72. The show's in a month's time. You'll need 3 songs, costumes and choreography. Just be yourselves. From now on, you're opponents. - Oh yes. - Indeed. - OK? - See them? They look professional. There's 9 of them too. "Nine"? Well, goodness me, that's a lot of work for a mum. Tell me, do they all have the same father? Of course they do. Really. Let's go. Khetty would have been an ally. But her mother sent her to Boston. It was too far to come for the funeral. But you've got Willy, Omer. I'm all alone. Cheer up. You've got Mika. We're so talented, we'll win. me 1st you 2nd. Me first, you second. Who cares. We'll win it. The car for me, the trip for you. You off out? So many things to do before leaving for the honeymoon. You mean shopping? For a new swimsuit? What about us? Jade, Mika, sound familiar? Here's a clue. Jade's always looking for you. We're only off for a few days. Not forever. You usually cope. The least you can do is fill the fridge. No problem. No seeds or tofu. We're kids, not canaries. Fatty stuff, good, solid, greasy food. Make me out a list. Deal with it, Mayi. Imagine you're normal, and cook for your kids. Oh! Darling! They go when? Friday morning. In two days' time! Why don't they shout at us, always on our backs because they love us? We deserve no less. You want what? For them to stay. Can you negotiate? And for them to sign? Wait a minute... "A family song and dance contest"? - Well actually... - Forget "well actually". A family dinner's negotiable, but this isn't. Their trip matters more than us? I don't know. What's the song? Mum, dad and all of the crew Now I need to escape from you Don't like your rap. - What then? - A family thing. What family thing? Motivated, motivated stay motivated Motivated, motivated let's all be motivated - Stay motivated - Not bad. Be motivated Motivated, motivated stay motivated Motivated, motivated You broke your word. Nothing to say. Is this about Blanche? We said she wouldn't return, didn't we? She's Bastien's mother and it was her son's wedding. It was 5 years ago. It's time to move on. She hurt my family. So he was just a helpless victim? Dad can't speak for himself. And I won't speak ill of the dead, but he was a Casanova, a lady-killer. - He was a man. It's in our culture. You can't know. Respect my mother's grief. Excuse me. No! You can't sing that. That song was both of ours, besides, you're too good. You must give me a chance, even if we're enemies. OK. You're right. Did you hear, Félix? Even the little one says I'm gifted. I wanted to enter the contest for you. It's true. You never looked at me. When I'd been to the hairdresser's, or bought a new dress. But I thought you'd look at me on stage. Except you're no longer here. I hold no grudges. But you need to help me convince your daughter. We need to clear space for your grandma's things. Hermeline, you're welcome here. The family's here to help you out. But Marie-Aimée wants me to put all of my vinyl and music mags in the cellar. The cellar smells mouldy, they'll rot. The Bee Gees, Barry White, Michael Jackson. It's not the same in MP3 format. I'll talk to her. What will you say? I'll say: "Your mother is full of energy "and has a fine voice that just needs "to be heard." How does that help my vinyl? I'll give all my stuff to a charity shop if you sign. - What is it? - It's for Family Show. A family contest. Didn't the plan work? What plan? Jade and grandma on stage. - I want to too. - You must sign to participate. It'll be my death sentence. - We have to convince Marie-Aimée. - Shopping! It's as you wished. What else? Have you seen Jade's marks? No. In short, your daughter failed. "Jade is "very gifted and intelligent. "But your absences, and her need for attention "have distracted her, and influenced her results." What are they saying? That we're rubbish parents, basically. So what now? Our daughter has competed in the first heat of a song and dance contest and has been selected. We have to participate too. Are you saying we should cancel our honeymoon? I suggested a thing for us girls, but she said: "You're my mother, not my friend. - "And that's crap." - She said that? She said it. Why doesn't she dance with the cheerleaders? I suggested it. She said: "Not for those degenerates." - She didn't call them... - "Crap." It's quite simple. Your daughter wants to do the Family Show. - The what? - The Family Show. Did you persuade her? For our couple, the bedroom's our sanctuary. - We leave problems outside. - What problems? I'll speak to her. Sleep well, mum? Didn't Omer make it comfortable? I must speak. Go on, I'm listening. You felt obliged to take your dad and I in. But if I had a car, I could help by collecting Willy from school or going shopping. I can't afford a car for you. I'm not asking for a gift. - Give me that. - Hang on. Hello? I don't understand. What? OK. I'm coming. It's an emergency. Sign it. She'll kill me. I'll do the body search, she's a woman. - Has she talked? - No, just insults. "Fascist state lackeys." Super. Hi mum. God almighty. Khetty. Retained by customs? We didn't know, chief. Not until after. You fed me all that crap on the phone! It would've been easy to say. "Easy"... Let's go. The paperwork, chief? Get your case. You gave those scumbags what for. You've got it coming. Wash your mouth out with soap. Humiliated in front of my colleagues. No respect for the dead or the living! That's enough. I shouted "Attack", and she fell. You're feeling guilty, but I'm not a taxi. Her parents wouldn't have come. Come on. Off we go. I'm seeing stars, my foot hurts so much. It could be broken. The nurse said it was a sprain. A little massage and it'll be just fine. What would make you smile again, Honeybun? Do you know any family songs? I should have guessed. Can you help me find one? Parents signed? Have you? Has Marie-Aimée signed? It's good for the morale It's good, it's good We've agreed on sharing the prizes. The car for them, the trip for us. And Mika and I agreed to give you the trip! A good try! With a plucky attempt to wrong-foot the opponent. But the referee has stuck to his position and the answer is still no. Mika and I will do it without you. I'll say we're orphans. Well, well. And Omer's a real super dad. He answers the phone, when school calls, he goes away with his kids, rather than send them off. He's worth calling dad. I see. Get your form. We're not going. The sprain got better. I still want you in that little bikini. Yes, I promise. I'm rehearsing. The music that I love Comes from the blues... Not Barry Manilow. It's not family. Not for the family? He's everyone's favourite singer. Rubbish. No Mozart either. With the guard... Not Carmen. What then? Hello, son. They're staying. Really? But Bastien is useless. Can you help me find a song, that isn't depressing. That isn't depressing? You know the one... - In the groove - Shake it - Get on the floor - Call for more - Do you know it? - Of course. What a night Late December, back in 63 What a very special Time for me, I remember, what a night Didn't even know her... Grandma, they've got their first song. Really? Prince. The young love Prince. The youth of the 80s do. Barry White. Classic. Timeless. Boney M. Boney, Barry, Michael, no way. But I can't sing your old love songs. We need something that fits. You hid that one. - Princess. - Granddaughter. Grandma! My Khetty! - I thought of you. - Me too. - Dad! - Look at you! My baby! - You OK? - Yes, fine. What's up little brother? Where's grandpa? He's here, darling. Right here. Left too soon. Took your time. The plane was late, ask mum what happened. What happened? Just look at her, it's obvious. - This is my daughter. - Not any more. Plaits are fashionable, aren't they? Dreadlocks. And they suit her well. We'll get used to them. Customs had held her. Imagine the scene? Arrested? I was defending a sister. I can see it all. You've bled us dry. Didn't we count at all? Don't worry. I've been accepted at medical school. Do you care? Bravo, my girl. Your mother's a bit on edge at the moment. And you know where she's off to. Why me? After all I've done, that's my reward? What have I done to deserve it? Lord, have mercy on me. Give me back my girl. Tell me what I must do. You men are never there when we need you. I'm here. Asleep? I know you're not. I'm asleep. Remember when we first met? You were a wild young idealist. Like mother like daughter. Still angry? My feet are cold but I'm raging inside. I love you too. How about a cuddle? Just to calm you down. Can't you sleep, honey? No. What with the jet-lag. How's it going with her, our home-grown first lady? Don't call my daughter, your mother "her". OK? Come on. Drink your tea and shut up. She was so sad to see her baby go. She gave you your freedom. She gave me nothing, I took it. She doesn't understand. That's my fault. I didn't make things easy for her. You must be joking? You're so cool. - Grandmas always are. - Yes. But I always demanded excellence from her. I never let her off the hook. I refused to let her travel. She wanted to house share, and live with Omer. I refused again. All I said to your mother was no, no, no. What? Come round. Did you miss me? A bit. Not a word from you. It was you that left. You smoke now. And you're Bob Marley. It must piss your mum off... Uptight, yes. That says it all. "Uptight." In any case, I... So smoking's burnt out your brain cells. You look amazing. I love it. It's good to see you. Same here. Come on my love I dream of you I want you Let me slide Across your skin like a warm breeze A breath of warm air Not too disappointed about the honeymoon? How could you think such a thing? However, something you need to take on board is this: Mika, the nappies, sleepless nights, your studies, work on the house, then again... with Jade. Now that we're married, nothing or no one can stop us from having a real honeymoon together, if you catch my drift, baby doll. OK, my love, you're hired. Just sign this. What is it? Singing and dancing for a show. - With the Rioux. - Mum said yes? It's a problem. Dad managed to persuade her? Your dad has his limits, but it'll be OK. Thanks, darling. Room service. If you're not careful, my girl, Omer will look elsewhere. I'm not you, times have changed. I can handle Omer. My being in bed doesn't bother him. But what's bothering you? Me? Dad's death. The humiliation in front of my colleagues, and you being penniless. Your father was spirited. he'd be sad to see you like this. Respecting his wishes, means singing, dancing, and being happy together. We sing in church, mum. We could also sing in front of an audience. It would be a fine tribute to your father. Let's all go in for this family contest. You don't have to understand, just accept. Life goes on, eh? The show must go on. Singing... What is this business? I'll never sign that. Take the tray. Alright. - What are you doing? - Faking it? Are you signing for mum? It's forbidden. It's trouble. "A fake"... I'm only doing it for your mother's sake. It's useless with tracing paper. Wait. Let me do it. I see it's not your first time. Quite the professional. Do you sign your reports? Mika doesn't want me to. He signs. Mika's right, we shouldn't be doing this. It's teatime. The whole family's in. Thanks to you. - Hello? - Hermeline? - Leave me, mum. - You still there, Firmin? What aeroplane ticket? You want me out of here? But I'm fine here. Is it because of my last e-mail? I'll be singing. So what? Why call it "the house of sin"? Everything's fine here. You're over there, judging and accusing. No, Firmin, I won't come. I'll tear up the ticket. Your sister? What about her? Your sister's perfect. She's perfect. And always here for me. Unbelievable... No need for that attitude. I can tell over the phone. Enough! Goodbye, Firmin. He's quite unbelievable. You defended me? You stood up to Firmin? Because you're worth it, my love. Here you go. Enjoy it. - Thanks, mum. - You're welcome. So? Are we going to do Family Show? I'm with my family. I adore you! - What do we need? - Three songs, and some great dance moves. The audience is the jury, grandma will get her car. - And how! A kiss to get started A cuddle to take-off If you want the heat then move your feet It's good for the morale It's good, good They've got their 2nd song. We'll beat them. No problem. And at home. Jade! I've got it! A new song? I don't know the 1st yet. - Well, keep up! - "Keep up"... Where are they all from? I've got all the Just Dance, we downloaded the rest. Start again. - This will help. - Thanks. That's the verse. All the kids on the block And all that's best on the street, All the old crocks And girls so sweet All the spotty boys, All the family is there All the kids on the block And elsewhere - What do you want? - I've got the wedding photos. Hey, coach, look at those moves! One, two, three. Super. Do you want to be in the reserves next time? Get lost then. He gets on my nerves. From the top. It's a bad idea. Do Family Show without me. Don't say that now. If the federation finds out, I've had it. The lads will never respect me after this. You don't choose your parents or your family - That's nice. - Unreliable. Like a kid. Take some responsibility. I'm the only adult here. Oh, really! I can't afford to lose this job! I'm not a graduate. No safety net. I was able to study thanks to you. You held the fort. But I'm still treated as the family idiot. I pretend I don't care, but it hurts. My son says "conceptual vision", I'm lost. My daughter knows more than I do. Sometimes, it's... Coach. It's all I do. Well, we really need a coach. Do you still want me as your dad? Do I have a choice? My darling dad. Mika, kiss daddy. - This is worthy of... - Supermum? - What's up? - Where's my mum? Working. Talk of the devil. Yes, Marie-Aimée. - Alright, Mayi? - Yes. They're eating here. And my daughter thinks I'm of some use. Sorry to ask, but Omer's working, mum's out, Ketty's somewhere and I'm stuck here. Don't forget that I'm a friend. No, I haven't forgotten. - Eh? - I forgive you. - Eh? I can't hear. - You what? - I forgive you. - Twice in a fortnight. - Jade called. The other couldn't, he's dead. - What? - I understand me. Girls! Hello, my lovely. Granny, you've got to be in the contest like Hermeline. To show we're a real team. And you can make the costumes. All the mums can make the costumes, except you. Neither can I. Like mother like daughter. They neither sew nor cook. - They sleep around. - What? I understand me. That's why grandpa's here: as a sales rep. for sewing machines, he knows his subject. - Cool. - My love! - Is it young Hermeline? - Hello, Gérald. - Long time no see. - Yes. My deepest sympathies. Thank you. You know you're looking at the best sewing machine sales rep. in central France? - Really? - Yes. I always worked on Singers. Yes, I was a seamstress. If you'd heard my sales pitch and all my spiel... Not a sole client could resist. Excuse me. Here. I'll take these two. Right. Fine. I'm singing in Family Show. You'll be a star. Perhaps. That's just great. I'm looking for material myself. There. - Thank you. - Thanks. So... - There. Bye. - Goodbye. I'm glad I ran into you, there's a problem with my machine. I'm the embroidery king. I once made myself a Zorro outfit. Does it work in reverse? Reverse is over there. - Mind your fingers. - Yes. Can I come in? Blanche. It's been ages. We were speaking about you. Come on in. So... my wife. My mistress. I know it's unfair. So many people don't have love, and I've got two lovely women. Life's good. When we ran into each other, we instantly felt an attraction. - It's clearly fireworks for you two. I showed her my magic wand. It still works? - It's great. Here we are. - A nice threesome. We were just saying... You said what to my husband? That we could live together, that I could move in, now I'm a widow. - What do you think? It wasn't my idea. Let's go with "babble". I've thought of another song. We need 3, don't we? I suggest Jericho. In order to win. Do we know it? Well done, my girl. How come, mum? You hid that from us. You know we've had it, dad? There's 3 women. For only 2 of us. We've had it, man. Concentrate a bit. Watch me. What? It's OK but we're not there yet. Alright. I haven't finished. To achieve perfection, we must progress. We can take a break. - It's important. - But not just now. Let's keep the energy going. All the kids on the block And all that's best on the street - It's mine! - Thief! Give it back. It was a gift! I know where it's from. Husband stealer! You're strangling me! You're hurting me! A halfway decent woman would've refused it. It belonged to my mother! Félix told me it had been stolen. The bastard! Speak no ill of him. He was my husband. Grandma and Félix had an affair so they stayed away? - What a bore. - Exactly. Get out. - You don't exist for me! - Same here! What was that? I'm going to rehearse. Come on! It was just a necklace. Honestly, I'd even forgotten that he gave it to me. Did she bewitch you? Félix, even silent, you manage to lie. It's not such a big deal. Félix liked a pretty girl. So what? You seem to understand that. Only too well. Male solidarity. What does that mean? You as well? Have you looked elsewhere? Watch it, Omer! OK. You've gone too far. - I'm not like mum. Out! - No! I choose to go. Where exactly are you going? I'm leaving. In spirit. No one hurts my mother. She's got her faults, but she's not a thief. It was Hermeline's necklace. But she got it as a gift. You wanted us to be a family? A family sticks together, it's... A piss off! Family, I hate you. Your stupid melodramas and futile quarrels. Two overgrown teenagers for parents. I wish I were dead! Not bad at all. Do you want to be an artistic director? It was worth doing media studies. You won't always be with them. - You'll get a girlfriend. - I used to have one. But she thought she was ugly, too tubby. I thought she was magnificent. Super intelligent. We discussed everything. When I looked at her lips, I just wanted to kiss them. I was so in love. And then she went to study far, far away, left me in the lurch. Did you tell her? She might have stayed. I'm telling her now. Lacoste family: five. Hello. There's 4 of us. Clément family. Hello. Rioux family. Like last year. The same dad? I bet he is. Don't go there. I haven't yet. It's my 6th sense. Silence, please.

Dance 'til dawn Until dawn baby Come, come. Marcia dances a bit like a Chinese girl Hot Shoulder movements Flat as a hieroglyph An Incan of the opera Her head Moves fully in time And her face seems to Dance with the rest She sought a new style Brought it alive She's like A grasshopper A siren sick with love The dancer in flannel cotton Or cardboard What a night With the DJ dancing The place just comes alive Shirts in the air We don't care - Hey - He said - Ha - Gonna dance you to death Then I saw her there Just so fair... Heart went bump And I just didn't care But I had to move... Oh what a night We smile, we flirt You know it's true Just to get together Me and you Why we cry Oh what a night Dance 'til dawn Until dawn baby - Get in the groove - Shake it! - Get on the floor - Shout for more - Hand in hand - Get down All together now Go up Go down Go left Go right What a night We smile, we flirt You know it's true Just to get together Me and you Why we cry Oh what a night Make a noise for the Sabatou family! And now the Rioux family! Well now... - Linda. - Yes, Philippe? Verdict, verdict. Dear families... The clap-o-meter can't lie. There's no possible doubt. The victory goes to the family... Rioux! We'll see them again in the semi-final of the Family... - Show! Thanks. It'll be alright. You always said that, when I was nervous. So don't watch then. You didn't see her walking. Didn't hear her singing. Why are you talking to a box? Mum said it was voodoo. Are you a witch? Quick! Mum wants us! - Stop. - Did you hear what they said? It's all a load of nonsense. And who knows, perhaps I jinxed them. Come on, it's time to go. Come on. A tight victory for the Jadida family, who go through to the semi-final! Bravo! Thanks! Now, Linda, we're on to the next duel, between the charming Mittal family, give them a hand... Welcome. Linda, they're up against a family that, like you, are a force to be reckoned with. The Brehard family! Give them a hand as well. There's lots of them. Welcome. Well, Linda, it's time for the Mittal family. Good luck. You know, Félix, your wife is some woman. She was always dignified. Took some doing. Why did you cheat on her, tell me? The more I know her, the less I get it. Have you got no respect! Even dead, he turns you on? The audience clearly preferred the family... Brehard! That you'll have the pleasure of seeing in the semi-finals. Just you stay there. The next duel... - Is explosive! - A bit like you, Linda. Thanks, Philippe. With no further ado, give them a big hand, we welcome onstage the Lacoste family! As well as the Clément family! They've got energy. They've got talent. Let's leave them to get on with the Family Show! Too much babble Said that man Too much trouble In my plan Too much trouble He gave to me Too much babble won't set me free Here me right now, here me say Working women know the way When it's she that earns the bread And a roof over his head He don't like losing his role She don't know where's home He treats her bad, that's what I see Makes her suffer endlessly People shouldn't bad-mouth me I'm just talking Trying to be free His trickery made a joke of me But with that man I lose all my cool He says he's my prince But acts like a fool And he's not kind He's getting too rough All I need is a bit of love Kissing and cuddling I need it every day I'm like that It's just my way I need love Every day I need love And a real good time Take me in your arms Just say you're mine I don't need more I need a sign coming my way A smile, a glance Means you're here to stay And think of me But love is only real When two hearts beat as one I need to read it in your eyes I need love A kiss and cuddle every day It's just my way When I'm in need of love I just can't get enough I'm an addict for love It's just my way Deep down inside Too much babble Said that man Too much trouble In my plan Too much trouble He gave to me Too much babble To set me free It's time to realise, not too shout And to really hear the call There's too much baggage To work it out We're too small He gave me too much trouble If I make a scene I know you'll understand That you're still in my heart But love's only real When two hearts beat as one I need to read it in your eyes I need love A kiss and cuddle every day It's just my way What's up? Bravo! Bravo to you all. It was a good fight. Bravo. So do you want the Lacoste family to continue? That was a bit lukewarm. Perhaps they'd prefer to see... the Clément family! Well done to the Cléments. Magnificent! Family Show! Thanks a lot. If we don't buckle down, the Cléments could take this. We're only here for fun. No, we're here to win. That was brilliant, wasn't it? He just fancies my sister. She's in love with him. She kissed him like a suction pad. Just tell me, whose side are you really on? On the side of... Your question's a bore. A bore, eh? It took 2 seconds with Khetty. It's enough for love. Who do I have to sleep with to be loved? So here we all are. The tension is mounting. The moment has come to announce The teams in the semi-finals. Absolutely, Linda. So, the first semi-final will set the charming... Jadida family! Against the incredible bunch... of Brehards! Last year's winners. Our challengers, Philippe. Absolutely. The second semi-final will see the Rioux family! And their lovely mini-star... Against the wonderful Cléments! And their fabulous granny. We'll be back after lunch for the... Family Show! No, Philippe. Don't eat that. To warm you up, you need devilled crab, it would be good. I make a mean one with an evil chilli. - It's good for men. - I'm sure it is. Thanks. I think you're a bit of a witch on the sly. Don't mind about them. - It won't help us. - She's bribing the jury! Have faith in us. We're just beautiful. Yes, that's true. You ready? You alright, sweetie? I'm scared of forgetting the words. If it happens again, it's over. Win or lose, it's all the same. Why are dad's cups such treasures for him? We're his real treasure. And we're closer now, all thanks to you. You were always the very best gift. I was so happy when I knew I was having a daughter. Even if I don't show it, I'm so proud of you and Mika. - I love you, mum. Enough slop, we must get mean! Bravo! They've blown the clap-o-meter sky high! So, you've sent into the finals... The Brehard family! Bravo. And they'll be back soon. - Well, Linda... - Yes, Philippe. You know that backstage, the tension is palpable. Who will be the other finalists? Dear audience, are you ready? Shit, we're really enemies now. Swear we'll still be friends? I swear. What if you lose? Don't talk daft. And now... let the contest begin! All the kids on the block And elsewhere And all that's best on the street All the old crocks And girls so sweet All the spotty boys All the family are there All the kids on the block And elsewhere And all that's best on the street All those that won't pay the entry fee Have invaded the place for free Take it off Take off your shirt Take it, take it Take off your shirt Just sitting on a rock Tears running from my eyes Didn't know how to feel the power I looked up to the sky And saw the light Soul took flight like a bird flying high Turning in space It took a while To find my place I had forgotten That time changes everything So often they tried To hide it from me But it's all over now I want to be free My pain and suffering Can no longer be God answered my prayers I'm here, I'm fighting I'm proud I've got the faith Burning in me I've got the power in me The strength to carry on All the kids on the block And elsewhere And all that's best on the street, Those that wanted to feel the heat And those that needed To make the beat All of a sudden They got cold feet Mother, but time flies by Go on guys And reach for the sky We've got strength We don't need sleep Take it off Take off your shirt I've had my share of phantom love affairs That with a breath of air Leave by the back door All the lies I've been told Have hurt me to the core I'm not a child I won't pretend any more I won't be taken for a ride That's enough, no more I'm through with it God answered my prayers I'm here, I'm fighting I'm proud I've got the faith Burning deep inside In my heart The strength to carry on The faith's inside of me Faith in your love Is the light That illuminates the way Marvellous! Well, Linda, dear audience, be very careful now. The decision is in your hands. Without further ado, a big round of applause for... the Clément family! Excellent. Very warm. Bravo. And now, a big round of applause for the Rioux family! Excellent. And the verdict. Sadly we can't give you a clear winner. Indeed, Philippe, the clap-o-meter has given it a dead heat. An all-time first. What to do? Ladies and gents, I see only one solution. The final will be between the three families! The Cléments! The Rioux! And the Brehard! The tension mounts on the Family... Show! - A 3 way final. - It's a first. One of us will have to back down. Really? Which family? You lot? Us lot? Us? We danced like crazy. We weren't hanging around either. You moved on the spot. I do what I like! Go compete elsewhere! You should do fashion shows! Want a clout? Stop! Fighting each other won't solve my problem. What problem? I know what I'm saying. Your act was pretty good. Dad said it was positive discrimination. They can move their behinds. The manga doll overdid it a bit. What do you expect. She's not Japanese, she's Caribbean. Japanese or Creole, it's all the same. There's less of us than them. Wherever they're from, we're going to humiliate them! Let's get changed. That lot could turn me to violence. Right. We've come to a decision. We'll sing together. To beat the Brehards, we must work together! Join forces! That union's done in church. Fire in his loins, like his grandma. Modestly speaking, this reconciliation is down to me. I've forgiven. My love. There's always been good vibrations between us. It's just karma. What's karma? - A type of pain-killer. - OK. Very sweet. But don't get carried away. Why not? How do we prove family ties? True. Look at us. I'll do it. Khetty and I will get engaged. Not like that. I want a ring. - A real one. - Otherwise, no go. Time out. Rings and engagements can wait until later. Can't we let the adults speak for once? Grandpa Félix and Blanche did it... So we can say that dad and Marie-Aimée are siblings. What? And Willy and I have 2 grandmas. It's nearly true. My brother. The 2 families will join together. To make 1 family. We've investigated and accepted their claim. You haven't always been straight with us. You're competing with 2 nieces and a godchild with no family ties. So you also have a somewhat loose idea of family. Thus we cannot reject your opponents' request. So the final will be between two families. Good. Time for a drink, Linda. Pina Colada? For the last duel, each family must sing something different. Piaf. Pardon. Good luck. Hermeline and Jade have formed their ideal family, finally. Can't let rules spoil that. - You've a nice voice. - Thanks. It's home-made. Secret recipe. We'll all end up drunk! We need to tighten up. We'll sweep them away, destroy them. - We'll all do something... - Totally agree. It's in injury time, that you must... Music will live Some Michael Jackson? Or: Your indifference doesn't hurt - It's easy... - To be over you No, not that. It's too depressing. We need a family number. With the mounting guard... I said no Carmen. Mayi, concentrate. Hold me tight... No, not that! No way, dad. Bob Marley. Everyone knows his hits. No! We need some gospel. This is all useless. We must do something everyone knows. Hey, you up there. Any ideas? Thanks. It's obvious. It's got to be Félix' song. It's not obvious for us. You must have shared that with him? Of course. You know my song? Of course we know it. Well, it came from him. Félix. You're all hot stuff! Really great. To conclude this exceptional evening... Now for... Now for the duel that will decide the winning family of... Félix has vanished. Was it you? - What? - He's disappeared. It wasn't me. Right now we welcome back... the Brehards! Give a very big hand. - To last year's winners. - Absolutely, Linda. No Félix, no show. We must find dad. Quick, kids, look everywhere. Go! Go! We'll search the dressing rooms. - Come. - We'll go outside. Alright. ...Clément-Rioux! A really big hand! You can applaud. They're on their way. Right now. Right now, welcome on stage the Brehard family! Over to you! They were all set to win But they never returned The roar of the Pacific or the swirling African streams Destroyed all of their dreams Of freedom Oyez, oyez Captain abandoned ship Oyez, oyez Hoist up the main brace Sound, sound The siren on the salt wind Sound, sound The last crossing - We'll get lynched. - Improvise, I'll look. - How? - Whatever. What atmosphere, Linda! Bravo! Magical. You're wonderful. Bravo. - What's going on? - I've lost my husband. You know, you're by far the... - The car's nearby. - Get the cases. - Jack Sparrow! - What's going on? Help me. Ole! Everything's fine. People are just crazy. - Full of surprises! - Oh yes. One must always expect the unexpected. Did the others hide him? Yes, they must have. They think I'm a witch and he's my talisman. We'll destroy them. Friends? Friends. We found him. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. They has us on tenterhooks. A big hand for the Clément-Rioux family! So it's on with the show! I would never have guessed I'd see you again So many years between us But you haven't changed If you know better than your brother climb on board the ship But if the storm takes you Before your dream is fulfilled Remember these words Your freedom Oyez, oyez Captain abandoned ship Oyez, oyez Hoist up the main brace Oyez, oyez Captain abandoned ship Oyez, oyez Hoist up the main brace Sound, sound The siren on the salt wind Sound, sound The last crossing I would never have guessed I'd see you again To forget you I would have destroyed it all Bravo! Magnificent! Brilliant! A big hand! They've all been marvellous! It's the moment of truth. The audience must now choose. Show your appreciation for the Brehard family! - And now, Linda... - Yes, Philippe. Show your appreciation for... the Clément-Rioux family! Philippe, the clap-o-meter has decided! And the official winners of the voyage on offer from our sponsor: a skiing trip or a sea and sun holiday... And a car... are... the Clément-Rioux family! See that, Félix? Well, Hermeline, we made our ideal family. Subtitles: Eclair Media
