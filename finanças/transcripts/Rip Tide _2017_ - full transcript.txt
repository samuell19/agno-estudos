Mom, I want to talk to you about something. Mom. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, me, too, honey. - I don't want to make you nervous, But Morgana Ferzari is here. - She wants to see how you do in the shoot. Now, don't worry. Just be professional, okay? I was talking about college. - Honey, we've been through this. - Sofia. Yeah, Madeline, wait over there until Farriet is ready. Right now we have exciting things on the table... A modeling contract most girls can only dream of. All our hard work is gonna pay off. Yeah, but I would still love to apply, you know, have options. Uh, lift it up. Okay, turn to your right. Stop. Okay. This... will give you options. - The latest proofs. - Oh, excuse me. Um, hey, you are coming tomorrow, right? Darling, we can't do everything. Graduation's important. I know, and so is a meeting about your contract. Yeah, she's ready. - I'm ready. - Let's go. I'm waiting. Oh, this is futile! None of this is gonna work. Fashion Week is two weeks away. Where are my others assistants? Huh. If you remove the wings, you can let the simplicity of the dress speak for itself. And with this burnt rouge... bring the eye from the hemline through the bodice, highlighting the neckline. What a remarkable idea. - No, I just... - No, no, no, no. Why stop at one outfit? If I knew we had an expert in our midst, - I would have relied on you earlier. Morgana? Cora Hamilton, perhaps you should just, uh, curate the entire shoot. Now, while I don't mind letting Sofia's daughter play dress-up, - it might be stretching the friendship Just a tad to give her my job. Don't you think? Cora? Where are you going? The dress. Stop! Get away from me! Stop! Mom? Um, Sofia wants to know if you're all right. Why can't she ask me herself? She's on a call at the moment. She's doing damage control. Okay. Happy 18th, Cora! Sending you good vibes from sunny Tea Tree. Hope to see you soon. All my love, Aunt Margot. Did you see his shoes? This is a general announcement. Flight 1138 bound for Sydney, Australia, your departure gate is now changed to gate 26. What on Earth do you think you're doing? Do you think I wouldn't notice a $7,000 charge for plane tickets to Australia? - I have got a catastrophe on my hands - That affects both of our reputations, and you're running away. Was this her idea? - Aunt Margot's? - Yeah, of course. - I'm horrible. She's the fun surfer aunt. You know, I've barely heard from her since Caleb died. No, it wasn't her idea. It was mine. - She's always written and said That I'm welcome to come stay whenever, so I took her up on the offer. She said she'd love to see me. - What? Is that so surprising... - Someone actually wanting to see me? You know, taking a genuine interest, asking them things, - wondering what they think, maybe listening to them? I'm running New York's top model agency, one that will launch you into a career that will take care of you your entire life. Darling, I cannot give you my attention all the time. I don't want your attention all of the time. But maybe once, you could have made an exception, done something I wanted to do that was important to me. I missed most of my childhood, missed my graduation so I could be where you wanted me, when you wanted me there. I've fit into your life, and now I'm doing something on my own terms. Sweetie, I know that you're upset, but people like us can't afford accidents. - This was your chance to show Morgana - And the industry, the polished young woman You've become, not some melodramatic teen. Why won't you listen to me? - Even when your daughter is plastered on Every magazine in New York, it's like you still can't see me. - Cora, you can't just always run away. I am not running away. I am running towards something else, anything, as long as it's not your idea. Now, why don't you just go back and do what you usually do... Get on with your busy life and forget about me? Ladies and gentlemen, this is your first officer speaking. - In a few minutes, we will be commencing Our descent into Sydney. Cabin crew, prepare the cabin for landing. That's her. No way. Good morning, miss. We'll be landing soon, so here's your next boarding pass. It's gate 4. Uh, I booked first class. There's no first class on a prop plane, but I'm sure you'll have fun. We'd better get out there. It'll be smooth as glass. You know, tai chi is only beneficial when you don't actively work against it. I'm not working against it. It's working against me. - It calms the mind. Imagine how much calmer you'd be if you did it really quickly, finished, and could do something else. You seem to be missing the point. You used to hate all this stuff. The need for stillness outweighed my ego. Luckily, I don't have that problem. My life is a well-oiled machine. All set to pick your niece up this morning? She doesn't get in until tomorrow. You said that yesterday, and as its habit, tomorrow is now today. You've waited for 10 years for her to come back, and now you're gonna be late. Breathe. Cora? Oh, my gosh! Look at you! You're all grown up! Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Oh, you're moving in, huh? - Uh, got to be prepared for anything. - All you'll need is your bathing suit. Jump in. You want to drive? Oh. Thanks for having me. Of course. It was a wonderful surprise. Last-minute trip, huh? Yeah. You know, things are so busy right now. - If you get a chance for a holiday, you got to take it. Well, I'm glad you did. So, what's the plan? Oh, uh, no plan, really. Just kind of gonna see what happens. What does your mom think about you coming to stay? Hey, you know, she thinks it's a great idea. Okay. Good. How is your mom? She's good. She's fine. Just always working. It's a shame she couldn't come out last year. I'm so sorry about Caleb. Well, that's life. I should call Sof anyway. It's been too long. Sof. That's really nice, actually. Nobody back home calls her that. Old habits die hard. You remember when you were here last with your mom? Yeah. - Mom and I made a pact we'd come and visit Every year after that trip, but I guess life happened. Well, you're here now. Ohh. Oh, you got to be kidding me. - You better be the new paper boy, Owen. Margs, I just need you to hear me out, okay? - I want to help you. - Oh, do you hear that, Bee? - Owen wants to help out. - You can start with the bags, - And then, you know, the lawn needs a mow. - Sell me the surf school, and I'll do you a good deal. - You've only got one instructor left. - The thing is just sitting there. We had plenty of instructors before you started stealing them. And don't call me Margs. You know how much I hate it. Hello, little fish. Cora, you remember my mother-in-law, Bee? Yes, of course. It's very nice to see you. You're all grown up. - Listen, they needed the work, okay? Things have been drying up here for months, and Tom's a good kid, but you're wasting his talent - on a handful of tourists. - How many times do we have to have this conversation? - Let's get your luggage. - Margs. Margot. - I'm just trying to help you. Really? Yeah. Really. Because I do need help. I'm overwhelmed. I got all these surfboards, and some of them have a leg rope. And I know it's called a leg rope, but do I put it on my leg or my ankle? - And wet suits... - I know they get wet, But sometimes they're dry. What does it all mean, Owen? Right. Okay. I'm done. Everyone, I tried. I'm done. You have a nice visit, Cora. - Hi. - You're taller. See you later, Bee. I'm sorry, hon. Just ignore him. Ignore them both. A heads up would have been nice. - You don't have a mobile phone. - What was I supposed to do? Send a pigeon? - I was gonna clean up today. Oh. Your place is very Boho-Chic. It's not bad for a couple of surfers, I guess. Your aunt took out the world championship the year you were born. - Really? - Yeah. And twice after that. Margot is a world record holder. I'm sure her mom has bored her with that already. Um, no, actually. She has not. I better get going. This surf festival is doing my nut. All those geriatrics organizing events. - Someone is gonna pop their clogs. I'll leave you to it. - Have fun. - Okay. Bye. Uh, what's the festival? Oh, well, surfing is a way of life around here, and this year is 100 years since Bee's grandmother paddled out and surfed with the boys. - Violet was a bit of a trailblazer. So they're throwing her a party. That's pretty cool. Yeah. It is. Now, come on. - Let's get you to your room. Uh, okay. Nothing much has changed. Your drawings are still on the wall. And I found some of your kids' books. - I better get that. - Uh, the bathroom is down the hall. The blue towels are yours. Make yourself at home. Hello? How are you? Why are you knocking? You usually just walk in. You have a guest. - Well, should I ask what that is? It's a welcome gift. You know, the ocean, sunshine, "Welcome to Australia." You're gonna give a girl from New York a dead fish? Well, now it seems weird. Oh! You're purdy. - Owen dropped by this morning. - Again? Uh-huh. Margot, you have a girl creeping outside of your bathroom. Oh, that's Chicka. She popped in for lunch post-surf. - 'Sup? - Cora, this is Chicka, who thinks my house is a hotel. I ate your sandwich. - Sorry. - And this is Tom... Blue Soul's surf instructor. - How you going? - H-How am I going where? Did you want a coffee? Yes, please. Oh. Okay. Belinda, no, no, no, no, no. No chickens in the kitchen. Oh! Honey, honey. - Can you...? Thank you. - N... uh. Yeah. - Okay, it's... - So, what did Owen want? Oh, the usual. He wants to buy Blue Soul Surf, the kit, you, our contracts. And what did you say? She said yes. Owen's your father now. I said no. Cora, did you want to, you know, check out the rock pools? - You used to love them when you were a kid. Oh, uh, thank you, but I should actually really check in back home. Um, what's your Wi-Fi? What? Margot doesn't have the Internet. Doesn't have the Internet? - Like, I-is that 'cause you call it something else... - Kangaroo line or something? No, I'm just not great with things like that. Things like the 21st century? It's nice not having to be connected to the rest of the world when I'm at home. It helps my Zen. Zen? But Tom set up Wi-Fi at Blue Soul, So you can, you know, pop down there whenever you like. Great. Yeah. Uh, I'll just... I'll go change. Are you gonna get changed, too? 'Cause I'm just gonna wear this. Popping candy? Every time I eat them, I just... I imagine a bunch of guys in suits in a boardroom surrounded by takeaway boxes. They're tired, but then this one guy slams his hand on the desk, and he says, "I got it! A candy that when you eat it makes the sound of frying onions!" Then the other guys are like, "Wow! Yes! Good idea, Steve!" Oh, I just... just love popping candy. So, who are you talking to? I'm not talking to anyone. Margot says you're a bit of a fashionista. Yeah, yeah, I'm a model, actually. Sweet. I know a guy in New York. His name's Patrick. You know him? There are over 8 million people in New York. Mm-hmm. He always wears a hat. No. - I'll let you get back to your mates. Hey, Mom. I think I really focused up on the plane here. So, um... I've just been... I've been feeling... I just... Why don't you give me a call when you get this? You've reached the office of Sofia Hamilton, New York's premiere modeling agent. Please leave a message. Everything all right? Yeah. Fine. Just tired. Max... e-mail... Is okay with your short list for Wednesday's job. - No response. - Jennifer... Cellphone voicemail... wants... - Anything from Cora? No. Nothing from Cora. What else? - Dobrovski... - Cellphone text... "Moved meeting to Tuesday morning." You're free. Book it in. What's wrong? Something's bothering Cora. - I think a code coconut is in order. Well... We'll need helmets. Chicka was definitely concussed last time. Batter up! - They can't be serious. - Come on! - Whoo! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! You can't be serious! Whoa! What am I supposed to do? You've got a bat, woman. Hit it. You could have killed me. It's all right. We've got helmets on. Eye on the coconut. - It'll make you feel better. - I promise. Aim to hit it from underneath. - Better about what? Better about whatever you need to feel better about. - Now, go low! - She's gonna lollipop it! - Go! - Whoo! Come on! Whoo-hoo! Come on. It's time for the best part! - Whoo! - Catch you later! Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on! What about sharks or jellyfish? - When's the last time you went swimming? In the ocean? As a kid. - The last time I was here, probably. Well, then, it's about time. It's nice as! The air's different here. I mean, it's, like, perfume. It's a bit different from New York, huh? Margot said you model. Yeah, yeah. Teen fashion, mostly, but Mom's been training me for editorial. Training? How hard can it be? - Chicka. - What? You just lie around in clothes. I do that all the time. I'm doing it right now. Yeah, it's... it's okay. A lot of people think it's easy. It actually requires a surprising amount of work. Sof must be very proud of you. Yeah, well... - I might take a break from... Modeling soon, anyway. Yeah, I don't blame you. That video was pretty mean. I mean... It wasn't that bad. Yeah, look, there are a lot of people who work really hard to get the cover shoot. If you make one mistake, even if it's a little one, it's the end of the world. You know, it seems like you're the most important person in the room. In actuality, you're nobody. You can't be perfect all the time. - I know a thing or two about making mistakes in front of a critical audience. Oh, yeah. Like that time you wiped out - in the Wahine's Women's Open. - Chicka. What? It was in the heats, not even the final, and she just, like, completely ate it. Thank you. I forgot about that. I did wipe out more than once. Mm-hmm. But every time I made a mistake, I learned something... Something about my technique or my attitude, who to trust. Exactly. And who cares what those fancy pantses in New York think, anyway? I know it sounds silly, but where I come from, the fashion that we wear, it's... it's just art. It's pure art. You should see what these designers do. They don't just buy fabrics and follow a pattern. I mean, they're architects. They... They research, and they're always hunting down new materials and seeking out ways to make it all come together, you know? You sound very passionate. Yeah, I mean, it's just my observations. Here's an idea... Why don't you two go for a surf tomorrow? It's gonna be a beautiful day. Sweet. Yeah, let's do it. I can't surf. Oh, well, that's all right. Neither could I before I went out the first time. Up. Upright. Okay. Move this back foot. Breathe in. Feel the movement of the water. You are a part of the sea. You are the current. You are a jellyfish. You are at one with the ocean. You're a dolphin. I don't think this is working. Oh, well, this is how Margot taught me. Yeah, speaking of Margot, maybe she can come out with us next time. Open your eyes! And go, Cora! Go! Paddle! Paddle! - Yeah, girl! Whoo! Go, Cora! Hello? - Margot. Sof. Hey, uh, how are you? Fine. Well, as fine as you can be when your daughter skips town. Oh, I thought as much. Didn't seem like you to push for a last-minute holiday. I haven't heard from you in a while. I have tried to call. - Did you get the flowers I sent for... Yeah. Yeah, I did. Thanks. I meant to call back, but, well, you know... So, Cora grew up. She's great, Sof. She's... She's gorgeous. Yeah, she is. Is she all right? Not getting in your way? No, no, no, no. Not at all. I mean, she was... She was a bit out of sorts when she arrived, but actually, she's out surfing right now. Wow. That sounds dangerous. It's strange. It's kind of like having my teen sister back again. How's your, uh... How's your work? Uh, busy. How about you? Yeah, yeah, tied up with things here. So, have you sold Blue Soul? Why would I do that? I thought it wasn't going so well. You don't know how it's going, actually. It's just basic business principle. It doesn't have to be personal. Of course it's personal. Isn't that why you deigned to visit us last time? Because you were struggling with work, And you needed a break? Because sometimes it's personal. I'm sorry to cut this short, But I'm being hassled by my next appointment. I just wanted to see if Cora was all right. I'm glad she's okay and that you're both having fun together. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Sof, I... Sof? Cora. You're doing well. I think Chicka's trying to kill me and make it look like an accident. I've seen worse first attempts. Well, thanks. Who are they? - Wave Masters. Only other surf school in Tea Tree. - Come on, guys. Let's go. - Come on. All right, grab it now. Now, let's move it, move it. - Come on, guys. Follow me. - We're heading down to the beach. Let's go, go, go. Hey, that guy was at Margot's the other day. Yeah, Owen. He's been trying to get Margot to sell for a while. She's having none of it. You want to boost my numbers? Join my lesson tomorrow? Tell you what, if Chicka gets taken by a shark, you will be my first call. Before you say anything, this wasn't my idea. I didn't want to be the head of the festival committee. No, Frank, we are not having a Guess Your Weight stand. Why not? Beryl, how much do you weigh? - Excuse me. - That's why. I thought Dolores was head of the committee. Well, she was until she had the nerve to jump ship. Dolores has moved? She's on holiday. She's in Cairns. The details are not important. We just have to band together, and if I'm stuck with them, you're stuck with them. What's wrong with your house? Darling! Wonderful! We need your fashion eye. This is the one I was talking about. She works in fashion in New York. We are putting together a vintage swimsuit display that spans 100 years. What do you think? We can't get it to work. It's not supposed to hang like a sack. Yeah, uh, I don't really do this, so... I'll... I'll let you guys to it. - No, no, no, no. Don't you worry about hurting our feelings. What do you think? I mean, honestly? Yes, yes, darling. Hmm. Ready, Mommy? To begin, I'm gonna need a sewing machine. Now, the idea is to show different eras of swim wear fashion, but all ideas are welcome. Aha! Here we go. Ohh! Now... this was Grandma Violet's, given to me by my mother, and now I'm giving it to you. - Ohh! Ohh! - Careful. Have fun with it. Go wild. - Yeah. No one's ever really asked for my opinion before. More fool them. - Do you got it? - Yeah. - Shall I help? - No. Arm day. All right, I'll stand behind you in case you drop it. Ah, she's flying. It's beautiful. It's like a dance. It's 'cause they're working together... Surfer and the sea. Can't tell with the wave ends and she begins. First thing... We're gonna need some awesome surfer girls. Can you help me with that? Yeah. You're looking at one, sister. Second... Can you keep a secret? Sealed. Thought this might get the creative juices flowing. These are really good. Thank you. Do you see them in your head first and then draw it, or does it just happen? Yeah, yeah, I see them in my head. Well... Or I feel it, actually. - Feel it? - Yeah. I imagine what it would feel like if I was wearing it. Hello? Whoa! And goodbye. Chicka, wait. Come here. I need you to be my model. What? Little, old me? I thought you'd never ask. It's, uh, nice. It's not exactly what I was going for. Hmm... Maybe if I strike a pose. Ohh! Sorry! We need functionality, not just aesthetics. I could skate down the runway. Whoo! - No! - Aah! Need a hand? No. Thank you. We have a, uh... A certain percentage of... Of customers that will only seem to book once. Is that a statement, or do you want my opinion? Well, you've never been one to keep your opinion to yourself. Well, in that case, maybe you should stop running your lessons like a military exercise and let people have some fun. That's all fun and games until someone runs out of business. - What is this? - What is it? This music... I'm nearly falling asleep here. It's the blues. Yeah, I'll say. Shocking. Oh, here we go. You're gonna like this. That's better. We never have, and we never will agree on music. Mm-hmm. Come on. No. The '90s are over. You need to let them go, Owen. Come on. We had some good times... You, me, and Caleb. Yeah. We were pretty blessed. Sometimes I feel like he's... I feel like he's slipping away. He's still out there, Margs. I feel him every time I paddle out. Hold your horses, kiddo. Oh, hey. Just gonna go catch up to Margot. Why don't you put these on instead? We... I would, but she's... Margot isn't gonna go for a surf. - Uh, she just walked down. - I just saw her. Well, that's true, but she won't go out. What's she doing, then? The same thing she's done every day for the last year. She doesn't go in the water anymore. Wait, she... she hasn't surfed in a year? I thought she was a pro surfer... the trophies. Well, she is, darling. That... That doesn't make sense. Sometimes when we're hurting, The last thing we want to do is what will make us feel better. Is she scared because of what happened to Caleb? When I was a kid, we had this big, old eucalyptus tree in the garden. It was beautiful. It had a little magpie in it, And every morning, it would warble away. For five years, I was sent to school To the sound of that happy, little fellow. One day, my father got an ax, and he chopped the tree down. I was devastated. No more branches to cast shadows on the wall. No more Mr. Magpie. We got a pool... An above-ground monstrosity. Well, it was so hot the pavements were melting, and I still refused to get in it. Why did you hate the pool? Because if I'd got in the pool, it would be like I was okay with the tree being gone, and I wasn't. I was still angry. But I realized there were things to be happy about, And that put the sad things into perspective. Things happen and they change us and we can't control that. What you can control is how they change you. I'm sorry about Caleb. And about your tree. Oh, don't be. Now, 4:00 p. m. tomorrow, Chicka says she's lined up some girls for the fitting. Oh, yeah. Uh... You'll be fine. Walk this way. Now... Now, come over here to me, - and you see up here? - That's what I'm doing. You just nip those off. - Cora! Whoo! - Hey. - Hey! Yeah! - Okay. Ooh, check it out, girls. I thought we were getting bikinis. No, uh, bikinis weren't invented until the '40s. Your outfit is inspired by the Edwardian Era. Ta-da! What are you doing? It's heaps better. Now you can see my legs. Oh, is it? Is it heaps better? Well, is there anything else you'd like to make heaps better? No. What? No. I didn't realize Tea Tree Beach was home to such a fashion expert. Uh, I just thought that... Why don't you take over and design the whole thing? Come on, Cora. She didn't mean to upset you. Dressing up is supposed to be fun. You think this is just dress-up? What's her problem? Ah! What's going on in there? She ruined my design. And talking to her like that's gonna fix it? She hacked it to pieces. Well, I don't know. Does she have a point? - A point? - It's like you people Don't know anything about beauty or design. "You people." It's these people that have embraced you And asked you to help out with their festival. What have your people done for you, Cora? Pushed you around, spread rumors about you? You're right. My people are nothing like your people. And I'm fine with that. Thanks, but I'm not hungry. Well, I'll just leave it here, then. Aunt Margot, did you and Caleb ever fight? Never. Yes. Oh, all the time. Blue Soul nearly killed us more than once. Why do you keep running it, then? It's all I have left of him. Is that why you hate Owen? I don't hate Owen. The three of us were great friends. Owen was there surfing with Caleb the day that he died. I heard the fitting didn't go so well. Ugh! Yeah. I kind of lost it. You're passionate. Don't apologize for that. You just need a bit of patience. I don't know. I- I constantly just feel like I'm saying the wrong thing. It takes courage to speak your mind. Our family makes strong women, and you're one of them. Be proud of that. That chicken. Belinda! No! Out, out, out, or I will cook you! Chicka. Hey. I owe you an apology. I'm sorry about yesterday. You were real mad. I thought you might explode into a thousand pieces. I know. Do you think the others might forgive me? We're going out to surf soon if you want to join. Yeah, I'd love to. You looking for Tom? He's on the beach. And don't worry. He's not one to bear grudges, either. Here. Thank you. Hey. They won't hurt you. Whoo. They're beautiful. Whose are they? Don't know. Hey, listen, I was thinking, and I might bring out a line of bikinis, after all. That's a shame. Kind of liked the knee-length look. Hello? Hey. This place is incredible. These boards are amazing. Margot really wouldn't like you being in here. This is so beautiful. I almost thought it would have a heartbeat. It's not finished. I need to, um... It needs to be finished. Wait, is this place yours? This was Caleb's workshop. Those are his boards. This one is mine. Wait, you design boards? You never asked. So, how come you haven't finished it, then? Can we come out of here? Yeah. Nice to have you home. Mm-hmm. It's good to be back. Are you sure? Sometimes I think you prefer touring. Are you fishing for something? I'm proud of you. Those waves in Indo... They were big. Mm. And to be honest... I was really worried about you. You know if it's up to me, I will always come home. My wife, out taming monster waves. I love you. Ow! Belinda! No, no, no. Oh, no, you're not doing that today. Chicka, I really want to. Oh, but the surf's too good! And everyone's out. Even some by the name of Thomas. Hmm... Well, we better get going, then. Let's go. Um, this is very isolated. Should I be worried? No. It is a bit weird around here, though. When I was a kid, I thought a witch lived in these rocks. My brothers told me stories about her... How she drowned sailors and rode whales to the bottom of the sea. Have you told me that before? Don't think so. It's cool, huh? Cora Hamilton! So, you still want to make boards? Sort of forgotten about them, to be honest. I haven't been in the workshop for about a year. Do you miss it? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I love starting with nothing and seeing it sort of reveal... Reveal itself to you. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I don't know. It kind of seemed like he was in there waiting to be finished. - Who? - Your unfinished board. It's like he was just in there, waiting for you to come back in and finish him up. It's a "he," is he? Well, yeah. Well, a woman wouldn't wait around like that. You did that. What? You don't remember, do you? Wait, that was you? You were that annoying boy that I used to chase around? Yes! - So I have been here before. - Mm-hmm. And you've told me that story before. You tried to scare me with the witch. Bet you can't catch me anymore. Okay. Huh. So a guy can wait around, then. I wasn't waiting for you to come back, but I'm glad you did. Hello, you've reached 1955. There's no Internet but great gas prices. Darling, it's me. - Mom? How are you? - Good. Great. - That's good. It's lovely to hear your voice. Yeah. Yours, too. I have to say the apartment is very quiet without you. But I have some very exciting news. What's up? Well, I've been working like a dog to get you that contract, and guess what. Morgana wants you to launch her upcoming New York campaign. So, uh, wait, what does this mean? This means you have a new chance, and I think your trip to Australia has actually been a good thing for both of us... A new perspective, some time away to work things out. But you'll need to come home as soon as possible. Lily is booking flights as we speak. We can get you on a plane tonight. Wh... Tonight? Th... That's so soon. I-I can't. Morgana wants to see you on Tuesday. Look, I'm sure the schedule is tight, but there's this festival... This is a chance for you to wipe your slate clean, and I want to help you do that. Lily will send through the flight details. Oh, my appointment's here. I got to run. Call me on your way to the airport. Bye, darling. I can't believe this. What? That I actually thought that I could stay here, have this. Have what? That was my mom. My modeling contract's back on, so I have to go back to New York. You're leaving? I was always gonna have to leave eventually. You... You get some modeling thing and you... You go? It's not just some modeling thing. I mean, it's... It's a really big contract. You know... If that's what you want. I've worked years for this. I thought modeling made you unhappy. It does. Sometimes. But... But what? - I'm not like you. I can't just give up a good opportunity because it got too hard. What does that mean? It means the keys aren't locked up, Tom. Okay, nothing is stopping you from going in there And finishing that board. Tom. Hey. What's wrong? I got the contract with Morgana Ferzari. Well, congratulations. But what about design? I'm really sick of people telling me what is and is not my dream, especially when no one here has the courage to actually do what they love. I'm just saying don't be afraid to do the thing that's gonna make you happy. Yeah, says the pro surfer who doesn't even surf. Look, I walk around this place and Blue Soul, and it's like I can almost still feel Caleb. But it's this dark and sad version of him. It's so heavy. No wonder you're afraid to get in the water. You'll probably sink. I lost my husband. Yeah, you don't want to sell the school, but you don't want to run it. You don't want Tom to work with Owen, But you don't want him to work for you. It's like you're stuck. Why don't you look around and see all of the people who are willing to be stuck with you? Whoa. Sorry, miss. This is way too heavy. You can't take this. We got to go. Miss, we've a storm front coming in. Are you on or off? What do you want? Margot! Margot? Margot! Wait, Tom. I couldn't do it. I couldn't go. I'm so scared because I feel like I may have just ruined the best things I've ever had. You haven't ruined it. I've got to go check the boats. There's a storm coming. Can you find Margot, tell her I'll meet her at Blue Soul? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm? Margot. Her board. I love you. Caleb. Margot! Margot! Margot! Are you sure? So she didn't even board the plane? Yeah, I see. Yes, I will notify Morgana. Yeah, good night. Ready, mommy? We're ready. It's going to be my new party dress. Wow, darling, it's certainly unique. It's wonderful. You're so creative, Cora. Is that sticky tape? Yep, and I used staples, too. It's perfect. Can you make me one? But you're a giant. Now, come on, model it for us. Come on, darling. Keep your shoulders back and chin up. - Chin up. - Look like you're having fun. Smile, Cora. Smile. You beam when you smile. I just wanted to show you what I made. And it's fabulous. Sof, I don't think she wants to. Do it properly. Cora, do it like we practiced. Walk like this. Here. Copy me. Good girl. Oh, you pretty girl. I don't want to do it anymore. I didn't think I would ever be ready to say goodbye. I'm surrounded by people who love me and this life that we built together. And I'm gonna be okay. So I'm letting you go, honey. Okay, girls, time to get dressed up. - Chicka, boards sorted? - Yes. - And no one saw you? - None. Ooh, except for Belinda, but we have an understanding. Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, welcome to the main event... The vintage fashion show designed by Cora Hamilton. Take it away! Okay. Just have fun. - All right, girls, are you ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. What are you doing here? I came to apologize. For not listening to you when you needed to be heard. Mom, my heart isn't in modeling anymore. But that doesn't mean that I don't love you and appreciate everything you've done for me. When someone runs headlong into the ocean during a storm, rather than getting on a plane to fame and fortune, I guess they're trying to tell you something. I'm so proud of you. Deep down, I think I knew modeling wasn't your first love. But you're my first love. And I wanted you to be as close to me as possible For as long as possible. You know, designing's no walk in the park. You've just jumped from the frying pan into the fire. I know. And I can't wait. Cora! My friend Patrick liked your designs on Instagram! Wait, Patrick Delamore?! Yeah! Yeah, I told you. He's one of the most iconic fashion photographers of our time. Oh, so you do know Patty Cakes? Hey, I'll give you his number. Maybe he'll post some of your clothes. Let's go! Sof. What are they doing? Something they should have done ages ago. Margot's selling Blue Soul? No. They're gonna join forces. Margot's starting a pro surf school for women, like she always wanted, and Owen is taking over the day-to-day students. Now, close your eyes. It's for you. Tom, it's beautiful. Thank you. So, I've been speaking to some colleagues about design school. There are some great ones here. I'm right ahead of you both. I've already been accepted into college. - Congratulations! - That's fantastic! Yeah, I got into one in New York and one here. And...? What did you choose? Let's get out there! Cora!
