(heavy gothic metal rock music playing) (uplifting soft music) - [Jack] Man, I love downtown, so sleazy and dirty. - [Justin] Yeah, but don't forget the bums, the dirty piss smelling bums that make the place. - Oh, yeah. I mean, everyday it's school, work, school, work. Just coming here is like a vacation. No matter what you are, or what you do, if you're just some dumb bum dropout, bleeding heart liberal, struggling artist, hippie. - Well, hey, not that there's anything wrong with being a dropout. - Oh, no, no. (car engine whirs) - Like my brother's a dropout. He makes a good living out of it. - Yeah, what's he do again? - He's a porn viewer. - Aren't we all? - Yeah, but it's like big companies, they send him this porn. And then, what they do is he views it and he tells them what he thinks, and what they have to change in it. - Oh, and he gets paid for this? - Yeah. - Well, anyway, it doesn't matter 'cause everybody we know is stuck in a big mind-numbing, never-ending routine. We just think about everybody we see every day, like Charlie, the barber; Johnny, the hot dot guy, Gus Kentucky, the newspaper guy, Frank, the movie theater manager, Tyrone, the car wash guy, and that screwed up, crazy ass looking kid at McDonald's. Shit, man. I mean, we try to go downtown just to escape from the claws of everyday life. I mean, how many times have we come down here anyway, huh? - Once a week. - Exactly. - Exactly what? So? - So, we gotta get something new happen to us. You know what I mean? Like let's like hitch-hike across England or something. - Yeah, but that's how the movie "American Werewolf in London" got started. Of course, there's no werewolves or anything. - Ugh, man, well you know, damn. Let's like steal a plane, or jump off a building or something. - Jump off a building? Now, you're talking suicide. - Oh, you know what I mean? It's like, "Why don't you go and get kidnapped? Get some new shit happen to ya." You know, Chris Rock '99. - Yeah, you're right. - Uh, man, it just sucks, okay? (sighs) I mean, no aliens kidnap us or anything, you know? - You watch too many movies. - I know. To the movie mobile. (action music) - Dude, two more days till Star Wars, Episode One, "The Phantom Menace". - Oh yeah, what a religious experience. - Did you get off work that day? - Oh, yeah. Stamped, filed, sealed and on its way. Did you? - Nah, no, I quit. I went up to my boss and I said, "Look, I need May 19th off to go see Star Wars." And he said, "No." So I called him a fat-ass, cockeyed, bastard, asshole, and then I left. -Lovely story, sick, but true. - We will see Star Wars. There will be nothing to stop us this time. - So be it, Jedi. You did get all the six tickets for everybody? - All of 'EM. - Cha ching, (gasps) beautiful. We're all gonna go down in history. - Car music. (car engine revs) ♪ Oh am I'm a man ♪ What? (playful music) (drum rolls) (gong ringing loudly) - [Georges] Ah, God, you breaking up with me?

Hey, what the hell happened to your hair? - Huh? - [Justin] Wake up, bitch. We're bored. - Why do you think I'm sleeping? I'm bored and tired, okay? - Man, I'm serious. Same shit happens all the time. - Eat. - Eat, sleep, sleep. - Watch a movie. - [Dwight] What's that noise? - Watch a movie. Eat, sleep, sleep. - [Georges] Masturbate! - (chuckles) Sleep better. - Yeah, damn routines, man. When will this all end. I mean… (man chuckling) Uh! Uh, dude, who! Uh, uh! - Uh! Georges! - [Georges] You like that one, huh? (everyone grumbling) I've gotta shit. - No. - Why not? - 'Cause it's my bathroom, you're not shitting in it. - But it's (heaving sound effects) churning and it's- - Why didn't you go before? - Cause I didn't have to go before. - Dude, just let him use the bathroom. - It hurts! - No! - But when you're walking around and you're driving and stuff, and it, it, it's you don't have to go, but when you sit down and you start for staying a little while, it starts to go and you're churning, and you (gargling sound effects). - [Jason] Fine, whatever. Go, you sick asshole. - All right. - Okay. - It smells like shit in here! - No, it doesn't. - Dude, you can't smell your own shit. Like someone telling your feet stink, you be like, "Uh, uh, no they don't". - I can. - No you can't. - You guys can't, but I can. - So, you telling us when you go to the bathroom, and you take a shit, you're like, "Ugh"! As soon as it comes out, you're like, (sniffing) and you can stand it? - Yeah, I can smell my own shit, but it's not like I go there and (sniffing) ooh, that smells good. I don't enjoy it. - That's weird. - [Georges] Yeah, that's odd. - Yeah, it's like, when you walk into the bathroom when someone else takes a shit, it's like, uh, uh, you gotta leave. - Oh, yeah. - You can't take a shit in there. - I mean, you know see anybody sitting there like going, ugh! Oh It smells like shit in here and it's my own shit. I gotta go. - Exactly. - I mean you sit in there and you can stand it and everything, you know? I mean, people think I'm weird cause I put mayonnaise and ketchup, and mix it up in my fries. Or just like eat a cookie, take a drink, eat a cookie, take a drink, eat, sip, eat, sip, eat, sip. I mean, it's gonna come out looking like shit anyway. Shit is shit no matter what. - You're right, shit is shit. It comes out the same way all the time. Sometimes green, sometimes gooey, sometimes red or blue. Sometimes it has corn in it, or peas, but shit is shit. No matter what. - Shut-up. Are you gonna go now, or what? - [Georges] I don't have to go now, too much commotion. - [Jason] Asshole. - Can you get off the shit, please? Let's just get outta here, 'cause I'm sick of this. - [Justin] Shit. - [Dwight] Shut-up! I don't wanna hear anymore. You use it too much, I am sick of hearing that word. All of you, every little damn word is shit. I'm sick of it, it makes no sense anymore. You guys are too much. Stop, shut-up. Shut-up, shut-up, shut-up! (playful country music) If I hear it again, I will kill, okay? - You don't like shit? (playful country music) (birds chirping) - [Dwight] Come on, let's go. - Hey, wait, guys. I gonna get some food. - No, you're not allowed to bring food to the movie theater. (door clicking closed) - Yes. (bag zip buzzing) (door clicking open and closed) - [Jason] So, why can't we bring food to the movie theater? - [Justin] We just can't, now let's go. (movie mobile engine revs) - [Dwight] This sucks we should have taken my car there’s no room with Jason's fat ass over there. - Ah, shut you spook, I ain’t fat. - Dude, we're late as hell. - cause hell is always late, right? Huh? Huh? It tried to get some place, but oh, it ran outta time, huh? - Oh God, dude. Sometimes you just go too far. - Oh, too far, huh? Well, I had to stop at this place, but oh, I end up over there. Kinda like Bugs Bunny in that Albuquerque and shit. - Oh God. (upbeat music) (man chuckling) - Shut-up, jerk! (upbeat music) - Okay. (upbeat metal music) (truck honking) (heavy gothic metal rock music) ♪ Off to the movies we shall go ♪ ♪ Where we learned everything that we know ♪ ♪ 'Cause the movies teach us ♪ ♪ What our parents don't have time to say ♪ ♪ And this movie that make our lives complete ♪ ♪ 'Cause Lucas and Jedis are sweet ♪ -Super sweet - (chuckling) Yeah. - Man, this sucks. We're gonna be late for episode one, and we have no gas. - We got enough gas. - I know. - Where we going anyway. - Shortcut, through the woods. - Are you sure about this? Casting our fate to some woods we hardly know. (chuckling) - You ever taken it before? - Yeah, I'm sure. Nyuk, Nyuk, Nyuk. Soitenly! No, I have not taken it before, but I am told by many sources that this saves us about, you know, 20, 30 minutes tops. - 20, 30 minutes, huh? - Mm. - That's a lot of time. This better be some good shortcut. - Sounds good. - It's a good movie and we'll do anything to see it. - Yay. (movie mobile engine roaring) - But don't worry, we have enough gas. (movie mobile engine whirs slower) (sighing) - What a nice stretch of forest road there, huh? - We're almost there, guys. - The needle's kinda low. - Uh, huh. - What the- (movie mobile slowly dying) - I, no, I think, we are just about not gonna happen because we're gonna not... (action music) I... - What you do? - No, we- - No, no! - We're outta gas, aint we? - Ugh! Come on! - We have enough gas. - I bet this never happens to Trekkies. (movie mobile honking in agony) - [Dwight] Bitch! (echo resounding) - [Jack] man, crap. - Uh, ugh! - I can still go usually when it's under the line. It can still go for a little while longer. (upbeat music) - You idiot, you cannot do the same thing with one person, when it’s six in the car. It needs more gas, God. - Six? - Jason?! (group laughing) - Well, now what? - I don't know. - Uh, well, dammit, man. Do we go the way we were going? (movie mobile alarm beeping in pain) or the way we came? - aw, oh, what else can go wrong? - I got gas! Shut-up! (movie mobile dies beeping) (upbeat music) - that’s better (upbeat music) - Okay, so does anybody remember seeing a gas station anywhere around here? (upbeat music) - I think, I remember, but I don't wanna walk that far. (upbeat music) - Walk that far, you don't wanna? Look, you better want to, or we're gonna be stuck here forever. - [Justin] Rotting in the summer heat. - So, where the hell is this place? - By my house, pretty far. - Okay, all right. Okay, guys, a test of someone's own will and self-trust, instinct. I say we go that a way into the woods. - Why that way? (upbeat music) - Because what are we gonna do what society tells us? Going that way, looking for help like a damsel in distress. - Like it wuss? - cause it’s the smart thing 'cause you ran outta gas, so don't be stupid. - Well, but there's a gas station like everywhere, almost every block. - Exactly, you dumb shit. There must be. - Come on. Eh, eh, eh. Where's your sense of adventure? - Come on, man, we're late enough as it is. - I say everybody shuts up, we start walking, and we find out way to the theater. - That's another thing, why the hell are we so far away when there's one by my house? - Stadium seating, man. You can only find that at AMC. - Hey, we're greedy bastards, we want the most for our money. - It's shit, Dwight. The-the theater by your house is ghetto. There's popcorn everywhere stuck. There's gummy bears on the screen, stuck to the screen. - Okay. - And the floor is sticky. - Uh. - Your feet stay on the floor, your butt gets dirty from oil and grease on the seats. - Okay! - AMC's quality man. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - Well, I'm going into the woods, who's coming with me? (upbeat music) - All right, guys, let's go. (upbeat music) - Just on the other side of these woods is our movie theater. Who wants to walk in a boring straight line on a hot summer road? (upbeat music) It takes longer to walk down the road. We're almost there. We cross the wilderness and we can have the cool shade of the trees. (upbeat music) Guys, we have tickets for all six showings today. We still have a chance to see "Star Wars". It's just one last shortcut. (upbeat music) - Uh, enough of your stupid shortcuts! You suck! (upbeat music) And you suck, and you suck, and this sucks. And we're lost. We have no gas, you understand? - Why don't we just wait till someone picks us up? (upbeat music) - [Dwight] I’m not waiting around here, man. We may have some uh, sister screwing, uh, goat marrying, uh, beer drinking yokels come and uh, Make us squeal like pigs! that would pretty much be a bad thing. - [Jack & Justin] Ha! “Deliverance” - [Jack] And who knows how long we have to wait. - We'll miss "Star Wars". - Well? - I will not miss "Star Wars". (birds chirping) - [Jack] Well, we'll leave a trail of something behind. - Yeah, like those-those two Nazi bitches, Hansel and Gretchen. (birds chirping) - Gretchen? It's Gretel! - Yeah, Gretel and Gretchen. - No, no, no, no, no, Hansel and Gretel. (birds chirping) - Well, whatever their names are, we gotta leave something. What's it gonna be? - [Man] Well... - How about your Certs? - (chuckles) Nah, I'm not leaving my Certs. I like my Certs. I need my Certs. Jason has Alka-Seltzers. - Oh... In the backpack huh? You do huh, huh? Alka-Seltzers? - Hey, what if the animals eat them? (somber music) - Screw the animals, nobody cares. Kill 'EM all. - But no, animals are smart enough to know that if they eat Alka-Seltzer, boom they'll blow up. - No, their natural instinct tells them -yeah, they are. Oh, Alka-Seltzer, stay away. (action music) - [Jack] So, we're going or not? (action music) - What the hell? - Yeah, we're going into the woods. (action music) Into the woods! - Hi heeha! - [Jack] Yeah, we're just wasting this time talking, not doing enough walking. Let's get the hell outta here. - Yeah. (upbeat metal music) We're going into the woods, making our way. We'll find that damn theater if it kills us. (upbeat metal music) - [Jack] Jason, drop an Alka-Seltzers about every five steps or so. (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) (car engine whirs) (chicken clucking) (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - [Dwight] I hate nature. Look at this crap. Get rid of it all, bull doze it, burn it down or something. Put up big buildings and computers, and you know, the good stuff, electronics. Technology not this trees and... Uh. - Crazy. (leaves rustling) - [Georges] Dude, you're a black Nazi. - [Dwight] yeah but i’m right. - Man, you're worse than Hitler. (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - [Justin] Well, we missed "Star Wars" that's it, it's over. - [Jack] Hello, McFly, Alka-Seltzers, remember? - [Jason] Oh, yeah. I ran out about 20 minutes ago. - 20 minutes ago? We've been walking for 40! (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - You told me to put 'EM down every five steps. - Yeah? - Well, - Okay. - I ran out, so I stopped putting 'EM down. It's basic common sense and logic, really. - No, no, no, no. - Common sense, basic common sense would be to tell us that you ran out! Telling us walking 40 more minutes without telling us, that's no more Alka-Seltzers trail. (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - [Dwight] Uh, I hate this. We should have taken my car, we would have been there by now. But no, had to follow this asshole. - [Jack] Who's more fool, the fool, or the fool who follows? - [Justin] Dude, this is not the time for "Star Wars" quotes. - Hey, it's always time for "Star Wars" quotes. - Yeah, you're right. - [Justin] (in Yoda voice) Always with you it cannot be done. - [Jack] (in Yoda voice) You are reckless. [Justin] (In Emperor palatine voice) So be it Jedi. - [Jack] (In Chewbacca voice) grrraaagggrrrr - [Justin] (In Emperor Palpatine voice) If you will not be turned, then you will be destroyed. [Jack] (Luke Scream, Salacious Crumb Laugh, Jabba laugh) (laughing) So, anyway did you think I wanted to get lost in here? - No, but we're lost and can't see the movie now anyway, right? - We're not lost. - [Dwight] Yeah, we are. (leaves rustling) - [Georges] Yeah, piss heads, we're lost. You suck, I dunno where we are. (somber music) You suck and it's like, you suck and when the shit hits the fan, it's all about shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit! (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) Pure, simple doo da. (heaving) shit. - [Dwight] Shut-up. - Nah - Yeah. - You are the one that said to go into the woods instead of the road. - Shit man, that sucks. (upbeat metal music) - Stop saying that, God. - [Georges] What, shit? (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - Now, just wait a cotton pickin’ minute here, you saying it's my fault? - No. - Huh? - No. - No, no. - Uh, yeah. - You're the biggest bitch of them all! You chose the shortcut. (upbeat metal music) - I chose the shortcut because we were late, because- - Uh-huh. - You weren't ready, because you had to watch “The Exorcist”. - I got ready in 0.5 seconds. Then we went to his house. - And? - Yeah, that's why we're late. - I was on time, you know, okay. - After that we went to his house. - It's not my fault. (upbeat metal music) (chicken clucking) - And you had to… oh look, I got rotten pizza ha, ha, ha. - Then we had this slow idiot over here. - [Georges] It was good food wasn’t Eh, Eh! Don't touch me. - Yeah, he was sleeping when we got to his house. - You sleep everyday, dude. - Uh-huh. - Coz there's nothing to do. - And then he had to take a shit. - I didn't shit! - But we sat around talking about your shit. - We wasted all that time talking about your stupid shit. - Yeah. - And we're late because of you! - No. - We're late because of... - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Quiet, quiet, quiet- - [Dwight] I think we’ve figured out why we’re here. We're late because of him. - Exactly. - No matter how late we are, no matter whose house was last, we are lost. Lost in the wilderness, because of you. - Yeah. - Why? - Why? Why? Let me count the ways. - Uh. - You ran outta gas, we took your car, we had to fit all these assholes in there. You've led us in here without knowing where you're going. It all comes back to you. - Mm, ow! You hit me in the ear! - [Dwight] Good. - [Georges] Hey, homie, I thought you was talking to me. We cool now, 'cause I was gonna go kung fu on yo ass! Like Kitt Lee in the “Chops Of The Dragon Pants”, 1962. - [Dwight] I don’t watch your dumb movies. I don’t care about that. - Moron. - [George] Hey, Kitt Lee the bomb. (crosstalk drowns out speaker) - Okay. - Oh, that's it. (leaves rustling) I'm sick of all of you. (upbeat techno music) (heavy metal music) (fighting sound effects) - Uh! Uh. (tree branch cracking) (heavy metal music) - Eh. How about you? (fighting sound effects) - Uh. - Oh! (wilderness battle cries) (heavy metal music) (shouting) - Ugh! Uh. - Wa! (heavy metal music) - You, oh, you! (heavy metal music) (fighting sound effects) - Yeah! (heavy metal music) - Uh. Ugh. (fighting sound effects) (somber music) (saber buzzing) (action music) (light sabers buzzing) (somber music) (leaves rustling) (somber music) - Uh, oh. Holy shit. (suspense music) - [Kitt Lee] What's up, man? - [Georges] Oh my God, Kitt Lee, what are you doing here? It's an honor to finally meet you. - Oh, yeah? - But I followed your legend for so many generations and I'd be prepared to face the trials of the “Tests of Will”. My favorite movie ever made by you. 1960, huh? And "Drunken Fists". The one you made in 1970 before your untimely death. - [Kitt Lee] So, you think you ready to take me? - [Georges] Yeah, I am, but aren't ya dead? - Nah, I'm here am I? So, I am here to teach you a lesson, to show you how the fists of fury... Leg, that can break wood. (wood cracking) And head, that can break brick. So, you think you're ready? - So, do we fight? - Uh, yeah, and now I'm gonna kick your ass. - Oh, uh, what an honor! Uh, ugh. Ugh, uh, uh. Ya! - Eh, oh, eh. (Georges chuckling) - You've watched my movie. - Yeah. - You learned some moves. Ugh, uh! - Oh, oh. (exhaling loudly) Uh, ugh. - You white boy, punch Kitt Lee. Now, I'm gonna show you, ugh! (fighting sound effects) (heavy metal music) - [Georges] Come on, I ain’t through yet. - Ugh! - No! (fighting sound effects) (heavy metal music) Hey, Kitt Lee this is great. Oh. (heavy metal music) (fighting sound effects) (wood cracking) (Georges shouting) (heavy metal music) - Is that enough of Kitt Lee? You want more? Yeah. (heavy metal music) Uh.

Chinese chicken, ugh! (chicken clucking) - Food. (chicken clucking) - Why does it look so stiff? - Nah, no, dude. It having wild seizures. (chicken clucking and gagging) (somber music) - What the hell is that? (chicken clucking and choking) (Georges screaming) It's like fizzing out the- poop shoot! (chicken gargling) - What the hell's wrong with it? (chicken clucking and dying) - It's convulsing. (chicken clucking excitedly) - It's having violent seizures. - Ah!, his Alka Seltzers. (somber music) - You mother… (chicken clucking) (somber music) (chicken clucking) (bomb banging) (chicken explosion) (Dwight coughing) - Oh, oh man. (chuckles) Yeah. - [Jack] aw, you dunno where that's been. - Oh, God. - Man, it's fresh. It just blew up. - So much for the trail. - [Dwight] Wait a minute, didn't somebody say, "Hey, animals won't eat the Alka-Seltzers they have like, instincts". (laughs) - [Georges] Hey, instincts a little stronger when your brain's bigger than a walnut, buddy. - [Dwight] Oh, so you were wrong, though, right? - [Jason] I killed a little chicken. - All right, man. - [Jason] But what if it had a family? I’m gonna call him Mikey - Screw 'EM. - Mikey, you gonna call a dead chicken Mikey? - [Justin] Come on man. - [Georges] I’m sorry, I’m sorry. - [Dwight] I can see the Alka-Seltzers commercial now. He likes it, Hey Mikey. Boom! - Oh. - [Jason] I feel really bad about it. (leaves rustling) - About what? - The bird. - Don't be dumb. Come on, tree hugger, snap out of it. It's a bird. If it was that important and that smart, it wouldn't have blown up right now. You know what? I don't even need birds, chickens, or anything because all they do is feed me, well, the chickens anyway; get in my pockets or shit on my car. That's it, okay. Screw 'EM. (suspense music) (wolf howling) (somber music) - Uh. - [Justin] Dude, I was freezing my ass off last night. - Uh-huh. - We gotta build a fire tonight. (leaves rustling) - You know, I think, it's gonna get darker before it gets any lighter. - [Dwight] You don't have any ass to freeze off - [Jason] How are we gonna build a fire anyways? - Like the movie, "How to Build a Fire". - Oh, I never saw it. - Jason, think back, are you sure? - Yeah. - Every person going out or at least in high school has seen that movie at least once in every English class. - Yeah, they make you watch that more than “The Diary of Anne Frank”. - or, “Beowulf” (Imitating their teacher) motherfucker on monday. - [Georges] Oh, I hate those movies. Every year in English class they pop 'EM in the VCR and strap you to your desk, and they make you watch 'EM. Required by law or something, uh. - Yeah, in the movie, the guy's lost in the ice wilderness, in the Klondike. He slaps him like this. - Huh Laura. - To get rid of the numbness and he tries to eat his dog, Pepper. Come, come Pepper, come Pepper. - Oh, that's like the movie “Alive” - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Jason] They eat each other. - [Georges] They eat each other. - Yeah, it's kind of sick. I love the fact that it's really sick when they eat that guy's butt, that big dude's butt with the... 'Cause it's really juicy and squishy. Like, oh tender loin. - Dude, I would never eat any of your butts. - Mine you would. (laughing) (leaves rustling) - Yeah, right. (playful music) - Ugh. - [Dwight] Bananaweh - [Jack] Jason, we got a fire started. - [Justin] ♪ We didn’t start the fire ♪ ♪ It was always burning ♪ Dude, I am tired, I am hungry, and I am thirsty. - [Dwight] Bananaweh - [Jack] I. I have Certs I have Certs. If-if-if you chew on 'EM slowly, all right? And mix them up with your spit, it's like you're gargling. (gargling) - Like you're gargling. - That's nasty! (playful music) - Certs, brilliant, that's gonna freaking fill me up. - I'm hungry too. - See, he likes 'EM. - Gimme some. - Guys, right now, there are people watching the 22nd showing of "Star Wars", and here we are, lost! (playful music) - Do you think they'll ever find us? - I hope so, we've been here forever. - It's more than I could bear. (fire crackling) - Is Jason like taking a crap or something? (playful music) - Hey, watch out for that poison ivy stuff, man, you touch it and making hives and swelling up like a balloon, and red, and poppie. - Ha. - Watch out. - (laughs) Yeah, well- - Ok, he’s gonna be infected. I'm infested. (fire crackling) (playful music) - We have been lost for a long time though, haven't we? (gargling) - Time, there is no time. We're gonna be lost out here forever. (fire crackling) We're all gonna die here. We're all gonna die here, dudes. Ugh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. - [Jack] Jesus! Well, that's it. All outta certs, no more food for us. (farting noises) What was that? - I dunno. (farting noises) - Well, what was that? - Got me. (farting noises) - Well, what's that? - Still drawing a blank. (farting noises) - I'm so scared. - Maybe it's a deer. (farting noises) Or a chicken! - [Justin] It isn't friendly, whatever it is. (fire crackling) - Maybe it's a bitch. - [Jack] A what? - The bitches men, I saw him on the Discovery Channel. (playful music) - [Dwight] Bananaweh They kill you at night in the woods. (playful music) - [Jack] That's cliche. - No, it's not, man, the bitches, they uh, yeah, they put you in the corner, they tie you up and then, they kill all your friends one by one. And then when you... The-the-the- She makes these little wooden figures out of twigs, and hangs them from the trees. And when you wake up in the morning, she feeds you little wooden twigs (playful music) by your tent, where you're laying, and then you die. - Wow, somebody should make a really good movie out of that. (fire cracking) (farting noises) (inhaling and exhaling loudly) No. (inhaling and exhaling loudly) it probably just suck. (inhaling and exhaling loudly) (crickets stridulating) (wolf hauls) - You hear that? - What the hell's that? - Something’s coming outta the forest! - Oh, no, uh. - [Justin] I don't like this. Oh. - [Jack] Uh, it's just Jason. - [Jason] Sorry, guys. - [Jack] Gee, dick. - [Georges] I'm coming. (chuckling) - [Jason] Asshole. - [Dwight] Just gave me a heart attack. - [Jack] Well, I'm sure glad that's over. - [Justin] Hey, is anybody else thirsty? - [Jason] Hell, yeah. - Yeah. - I'm sure something will turn up. - Now, wait a minute, correct me if i’m wrong, is it… Isn't it, how you say, unhealthy to not drink? I mean, say-say we... All right, we're looking for a lake, right? What if we don't come to a lake? How long is that gonna take? What if we don't find a lake around here? What if we don't die of hunger, rather we die of thirst? - Mm, never. I will do the rain dance! I will grab this twigs, and I will dance like the bitches in the "Crucible" and our native brothers, the Injens. With the mask I have... And I will dance to the mead Gods- - [Justin] Give him space, man. - [Georges] And they will send us mead and rain- - [Justin] Where did you get that mask from? - [Georges] For our feast of nothing. our a feast of shit. (Georges mumbling and grumbling) - Crazy cracker. (crickets stridulating) - Jesus. (George mumbling and grumbling) - Look at him. (fire crackling) - [Jason] You know guys, there is another way. - What? - Haven't you guys seen "Waterworld"? - Yeah. - Oh, no, dude. - Dude, in the beginning of the movie Kevin Costner drinks his own piss. - Yeah, but that piss was purified. He had a little machine that cleaned it. You can't just drink your piss just like that. - Yeah, you can get sick or die. What are you thinking of? - Plus I’ve heard if you drink your piss like that, your liver will explode, you get kidney disease, your hair will lose pigment. You get bloated, you, it stuns your growth, and among other things. - Like Mountain Dew! (George mumbling in the background) (Dwight chuckling) - So, how much is too much? - A lot. - How bloated? - Really bloated and plus, man, that's "Waterworld", it was his last resort. (George mumbling in the background) - It is our last resort. - Whoa, whoa, no, no, no. I am not drinking my piss or any of yours. - Yeah. - He got a point. - I'd rather my grave say, Jack, died honorably with this fellow men trying to survive in the woods. Not Jack died 'cause we pissed in his mouth. (crickets stridulating) - I am not drinking my own piss.

You played us like a- - Uh, like a banjo, a shitty banjo on a hot tin roof with a bitch on top. (heavy metal music) - Yeah. - [Justin] Why would you do that? I'm dying here. - I'm the one who really needs to eat. Plus I'm the one who drank all the most piss. I got blisters and boils all over me. I got a freaking poison ivy rash on my ass because I took a crap over there in the bushes. I'm on a special diet and everything. You bastards deserve to die. (heavy metal music) (sighing) We're gonna die anyway out here. Besides, I think, "Babylon" five's way better than "Star Wars". And porn sucks.

As one evacuee said, quote, "It was a four in the morning, grab the dog and go type of thing." Meantime, 35 trucks and 105 firefighters from St. Petersburg, Tampa, Sarasota and Keneth City are massing in to lend a helping hand. They will caravan tonight and be on the front lines by tomorrow. No word yet on the five missing St. Petersburg boys that simply vanished, approximately one month ago, and are suspected to be missing in the same wilderness, where tonight's fires occurred. Police have not found any bodies and firefighters still don't know if they survived this tragedy, or if they were horribly cooked alive. (news outro music) (erratic music) (action music) - Uh, how long? - Four months, 10 days. School started last month. - Uh, we've been walking forever and still, no progress. - We could be walking every day, all day, 24 hours, any direction and still find nothing. I hate this place. (leaves rustling) - Nobody cares. Nobody sends a helicopter, nothing. - Bay flight! - Mm. - I say we split up, to hell with this. - Dude, we have enough hard time trying to survive with each other as it is. If we split up, we'll surely die alone. - To hell with you, I'm going. - You're stupid. - Fine, go. -[Dwight] Boss Nass - But wait. - What? - What if you do find somebody, huh? How would you find us again? - Hey, leave a Jason parts trail. - Yeah, I'm sure no animals will eat that, huh? - It's a joke, you damn hillbilly. - Okay. - Besides, we don't have any Jason parts left. - Yeah, yeah, it was real funny. Hey, he made a funny. Let's laugh at his funny. Oh, you're a jackass, you suck. - Wait, I got an idea, why don't we just eat you too? - Uh, go ahead and eat me. Eat me, take a bite! Eat!
