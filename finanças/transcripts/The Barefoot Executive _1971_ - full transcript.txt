DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THAT KID, CHIEF. HE'LL DRIVE YOU NUTS. HE'S 21 YEARS OLD, AND HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE RUNNING THE NETWORK. WELL, I DON'T THINK AGE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, BOSS. - I DIDN'T ASK YOU ! - WHAT'S WRONG WITH A YOUNG MAN RUNNING THE NETWORK ? LOOK AT WILLIAM PITT. HE WAS ONLY 24, AND HE WAS PRESIDENT OF ENGLAND. AND LOOK AT ALEXANDER THE GREAT. HOW OLD WAS HE WHEN HE CONQUERED MACEDONIA ? HOW WOULD I KNOW ? JUST DRIVE THE CAR. YEAH, AND LOOK AT ALL THEM LITTLE KIDS THAT WAS KINGS OF ALL THEM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. LIKE THIS LITTLE KID THAT WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD, AND HE WAS KING OF FRANCE. AND THERE'S ONE KID-- HE WAS THE KING OF ENGLAND, HE WAS ONLY NINE MONTHS ! NINE MONTHS ? A PERSON BECAME KING OF ENGLAND AT NINE MONTHS ? I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. YOU DON'T ?

[ Snorting, Laughing ] EXCUSE ME ! [ Jackhammer Stops ] YEAH ? WHA-- WHAT ? YEAH. THIS STORY ABOUT A CHIMP SELECTING OUR TV SHOWS. WHAT ABOUT IT ? WELL, I MEAN-- DO YOU BELIEVE IT ? OF COURSE, I BELIEVE IT. I KNEW IT ALL THE TIME. [ Jackhammer Running ] UH, MADAM ? WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE RUMOR OF A CHIMP SELECTING OUR TV SHOWS ? A CHIMP PICKING TV SHOWS ? RIDICULOUS. YES, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW THOSE RUMORS GET STARTED. I KNOW I-- WAIT A MINUTE ! THOSE STATIONS HAVE BEEN SWITCHING AND CANCELLING MY FAVORITE SHOWS FOR YEARS. MAYBE A CHIMP IS BEHIND THIS MESS. OH, NO, MADAM. IT'S A PLOT. YOU'RE ALL IN ON IT. NO, MADAM. WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO-- I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF LIKING A SHOW... AND HAVING IT PULLED OFF THE AIR OR PUT IN ANOTHER TIME. MADAM-- PLEASE-- IT JUST DRIVES YA CRAZY. I'M GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I-- I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TELEVISION SET AND THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW. THE LAST SHOW I LIKED, THEY TOOK IT RIGHT OFF THE AIR. THE MINUTE I GOT TO LIKE IT, OFF THE AIR. MADAM-- HOW DO I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM ? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN. HAS THE MAN FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED YET ? EVERYBODY'S HERE, SIR. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. [ Pounding Gavel ] GENTLEMEN, TELEVISION HAS HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE. WE CAN WORK THIS ONE OUT IF WE KEEP COOL HEADS ! [ Chattering ] "KEEP COOL HEADS." YOUR WILBANKS SAYS YOU'VE GOT A MONKEY PICKING PROGRAMS, AND YOU WANT US TO "KEEP COOL HEADS." I WAS DELIRIOUS. DON'T GIVE US THAT ! FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS YOU'VE BEEN THE THIRD-RATED NETWORK. SUDDENLY, YOU JUMP TO NUMBER ONE. NOW, THERE HAS TO BE A REASON. YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERSONNEL TO DO THAT. NOW JUST A MINUTE, CLIFFORD. I'VE PLENTY OF PERSONNEL. I HAVE PEOPLE ALL-- WELL, I-- OH, SHUT UP. MR. CRAMPTON. WE'VE HAD A TACIT UNDERSTANDING TO SHARE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. NOW, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE BETRAYED THAT UNDERSTANDING. [ Together ] WE HAVE NOT. JUST A MINUTE, GENTLEMEN. I MUST SPEAK FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WE CAN HAVE NO UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN NETWORKS, TACIT OR OTHERWISE. OH, COME ON, HARRY. HOW CAN THE DEPARTMENT CALL A LITTLE CHIMPANZEE A TECHNI-- TECH-- SO THERE'S A CHIMP. I NEVER-- THEN THERE IS A CHIMP ? [ Chattering ] [ Crampton Pounds Gavel ] GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. ADMITTEDLY, THERE IS A CHIMP. AND HE DOES LIKE TV. AND IT SEEMS HE DOES PREFER THE TOP-RATED SHOWS. AND HE DOES GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR AND GET A BEER DURING THE COMMERCIALS. - [ Chattering ] - GENTLEMEN ! IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVER FOUND OUT THAT A CHIMPANZEE... WAS SELECTING PROGRAMS, IT WOULD BE THE END OF TV. GENTLEMEN. I HAVE A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THE WHOLE PROBLEM. - YES ? - WE MUST DESTROY THE CHIMP. OH, NO, NO. I CAN'T SEE IT AT ALL. [ Chattering ] [ Crampton ] OH, WE CAN'T DO THAT. OH, NO. WE COULDN'T-- OH, B-- WHY, WE'D HAVE THOSE SOCIETIES FOR THE PREVENTION OF THINGS ALL OVER OUR BACKS. THAT WOULD BE THE END OF OUR DOG FOOD ACCOUNTS. GENTLEMEN, I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA. I HOPE IT'S BETTER... THAN THE BANANAS. IT'S PRACTICAL AND HUMANE. YOU SEE, A CHIMP BELONGS IN A JUNGLE, NOT IN A NETWORK OFFICE. WE KNOW THAT, DR. SCHMIDT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WHAT WE DO IS BUY THE CHIMP, RETURN HIM TO THE JUNGLE. HE'LL BE HAPPY, THE NETWORKS WILL CONTINUE ON AS USUAL... AND WE WILL BE RID OF STEVEN POST ONCE AND FOR ALL ! BRILLIANT, SCHMIDT, BRILLIANT. - BRAVO ! BEAUTIFUL ! THAT'S THE ONE. - WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE MONEY. AND EVERY MAN HAS HIS PRICE. [ Chattering ] SO THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK, HUH ? EVERY MAN'S GOT HIS PRICE. WELL, DON'T WORRY. I DON'T. STEVE, WHY DON'T WE TAKE HIM AND BLOW THIS PLACE ? FORGET THIS WHOLE RAT RACE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO PUT HIM IN A JUNGLE. JEN, THEY CAN'T GET TO ME. I CAN'T BE BOUGHT. $500,000. RIGHT. $500,000. THAT'S A-- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. WELL, OF COURSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY. HOW CAN YOU EVEN HESITATE ? WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW-- POST, YOUR FUTURE IS ON THE LINE. NOW YOU LISTEN TO THIS. YOU TURN US DOWN, YOU'LL NEVER WORK AGAIN. COME ON. BE SMART, BOY. I, UH-- I HAVE A PROBLEM. A PROBLEM ? YES, SIR. YOU SEE, SOMEONE ELSE IS INVOLVED AND I-- SON, NO MORE BICKERING. ALL RIGHT. THIS WILL BE OUR FINAL OFFER. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE MILLION DOLLARS. YOU DID IT. YOU TOOK THE MONEY. ONE MILLION DOLLARS, JEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH HIM. IT WAS TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. BESIDES, MAYBE A CHIMP DOES BELONG IN THE JUNGLE. NOT THAT ONE. JEN. WE CAN GET MARRIED NOW. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING. I THOUGHT WE DID FOR A WHILE. NOW WE HAVE NOTHING. I DON'T EVEN THINK I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH ANYMORE. [ Men Chattering ] [ Soft Chittering ] [ Mertons ] HEY, BOSS. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO ? WELL, IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT A MISSION TO TRUST TO, UH, UNDERLINGS. YEAH, BUT ALL THE OTHER NETWORKS ARE HERE. OH, I GET IT. YOU DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. [ Snorting, Laughing ] WELL, OF COURSE WE TRUST EACH OTHER. WHERE WOULD YOU GET A RIDICULOUS IDEA LIKE THAT ? I-IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE... GETTING TOGETHER TO HAVE A LITTLE, UH, OUTING. YES. AND YOU'RE IN CHARGE WHILE WE'RE GONE. ME IN CHARGE ? YOU'RE KIDDING ? WE'VE NEVER BEEN MORE SERIOUS ! WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IF ANYONE ASKS YOU A QUESTION, YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. IF ANYONE WANTS A DECISION, STALL. DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL ! NOW, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT ? YEAH. NOW WHAT ? UH, MR. WILBANKS, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE ? ABOUT WHAT ? WELL, UH-- YOU SEE, I WAS WONDERING IF, IF MAYBE YOU'D RECONSIDER. YOU KNOW, I GIVE YOU THE MILLION DOLLARS BACK, AND YOU GIVE ME THE CHIMP ? WELL, CERTAINLY NOT, POST. ARE YOU CRAZY ? A DEAL IS A DEAL. AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT ! OF ALL THE NERVE ! [ Horn Honking ] [ Brakes Squealing ] [ Airplane Engine Starting, Idling ] ALL SET, UNCLE. MERTONS IS IN CHARGE TILL WE GET BACK. HELP HIM ALL YOU CAN. MERTONS IS IN CHARGE ? NOW, OPEN THE DOOR, ROGER. GEE, I'M SORRY, STEVE. BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. BOY, I'D SURE DO IT DIFFERENT IF I HAD ANOTHER CHANCE. BOY, YOU GENTLEMEN SURE PICKED AN ISOLATED SPOT. I-I DON'T THINK THIS PLACE HAS EVER BEEN EXPLORED. WELL, UH, DON'T WORRY, UH, ABOUT THE CHIMP. HE'S USED TO FENDING FOR HIMSELF. OKAY, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'LL CLEAR THIS AREA, UH, I'M GONNA OPEN UP THIS HATCH AND THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF SUCTION THERE. AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN. RIGHT, CAPTAIN. WE'LL WATCH IT FROM BACK THERE. OKAY, UH-- TAKE IT EASY BACK THERE, HUH, GENTLEMEN ? AND BY ALL MEANS, UH, DON'T TOUCH ANY OF THOSE LEVERS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT CHUTE. IT'S GUARANTEED TO OPEN IN TEN SECONDS. OH ! DON'T TOUCH THAT LEVER. OH. THAT'S A NO-NO. OOH. DON'T DO THAT. NO, NO, NO. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE, CHIEF ? JUST FINE, FRANCIS.

[ Chittering ] - WILL YOU THROW HIM OUT ? - I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO GO. I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO GO, MISTER. PUT YOUR FOOT OUT. HERE WE GO. - GET RID OF HIM ! - FOOT UP. COME ON. GET OUT. - [ Screaming ] - OH, MR. CRAMPTON ! OH, MR. CRAMPTON ! I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN THIS, GUYS. YOU SEE, WE WERE CRUISING UP THERE AT 2,000 FEET, AND THE WIND-- [ Dialing Phone ] HELLO ? OH, STEVE ! YEAH. YEAH. I-- I SEEM TO BE CALLING FOR A FRIEND OF YOURS. SAY, UH, THIS IS GONNA BE HARD TO BELIEVE BUT... YOU REMEMBER THAT CHANCE YOU WERE TALKIN' ABOUT ? WELL, YA GOT IT ! [ Snorting, Laughing ] YEAH ! [ Snorting, Laughing ] IT WAS THAT SIMPLE. I GAVE MERTONS THE MILLION DOLLARS, AND HE GAVE ME THE CHIMP. WELL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH TO GIVE UP ALL THAT MONEY. MERTONS NEEDED IT TO FINANCE AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO FIND WILBANKS AND THE REST OF THEM. [ Laughs ] WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT, IT WASN'T EVEN MY MONEY. IT WAS YOURS. HE'S YOUR CHIMP. YOU MEAN, I GAVE UP A MILLION BUCKS ? [ Chuckles ] YEP. YOU KNOW WHAT, STEVE ? I DON'T EVEN THINK WE'RE GONNA MISS IT. [ Woman On TV ] AND NOW AN EXCLUSIVE.
