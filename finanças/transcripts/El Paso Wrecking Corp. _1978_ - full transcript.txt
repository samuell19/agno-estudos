Her brother Roy's a park ranger in these parts. She drops him off once a week to check out the area. Then she borrows his jeep and drives into Henrietta. GENE: Nice lookin'. HOMER: Sure, if I could get her to let me fuck her. GENE: She don't let ya? HOMER: Shit, no. HOMER: She just comes by, gets me all hot 'n' bothered, and then takes off. I was tryin' to get her to give me a lil' head when you guys showed up. GENE: Sorry 'bout that. HOMER: Ah, that's okay. I wasn't gettin' nowhere anyway. GENE: Got one goin', huh? HOMER: You said it.
