-That's enough for tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How do you feel? -Tired. -Margaret, please give me a hand. Your husband must rest now. [MUSIC PLAYING] [STARTLED GASP] [RELIEVED EXHALE] MEDIUM: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -That's Sanskrit, The black sign of death is on this house. Is on this house. [MUSIC PLAYING] -A little under the weather; aren't you? Take my advice and stop these seances. You get excited, your strength goes. And that isn't something you can afford to squander so lightly. -I'd ask you to preach, Charles. They're my only interest in life now. By means of these seances, I can cross the border-- the border of the spirit world to which I belong. -You'll never get better if you go like that. -Better? I'll never get better. All I can hope for is a quick death. -No. -John! John! Are you mad? [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's useless. The poison does its work too quickly for it to be effective now. -You must drink this antidote. Drink it! Drink it! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Why? Why? -You really had me worried that time. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't you realize you must get well? You must. It isn't only your life. It's your theory, your cure. That wonderful inspiration that'll save the lives of millions of poor cripples. Us -Yes. I mustn't forget the efforts that you've made. It's a heavy responsibility for a doctor to give lethal poison to a wealthy patient. -These two poisons will stimulate your limbs back to life. I know it. -Thank you. Give me faith. And If you change your mind, Charles, it would be simple to put me away. Drop more poison, too little antidote, and it is natural. You've a declaration, signed by me, which limits you to carrying out of my preparation. -All right, John. That's enough. You must try to get some rest. I'm off to the hospital. See you tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN: Come here, Catherine. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Get me a glass of gin. Over there. It's in the bookshelf. [MUSIC PLAYING] -More! -Sir, you really shouldn't. The doctor will be angry. -Damn the doctor. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You are late. You were an unusually long time in the garden. -I'm sorry, darling. But don't be cross. It was such a lovely day. -Don't say that. It makes me feel even more of a cripple. -John. [SIGHS] Why do you talk like that? -Because it's true. I was watching you down there with Charles. You were so remote, so far away from me tied to this wheelchair. And you seemed so happy. -I, I was happy because Charles was telling me you were getting better-- slowly, but surely -My friend Charles, the suave Dr. Livingstone. He is the exemplary, faithful friend. -If you're jealous of him, why don't you send him away? He isn't the only doctor in Scotland. -I know. But he is the only one who has dared to practice my cure on me. -Then what are we arguing about? Doesn't my being near you, my loving you, help or mean anything to you at all? -I am sorry. My apologies. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: You may go, Catherine. I'll get it. You know I want to be the one who takes care of my husband. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DRINK BEING POURED] [MUSIC PLAYING] -There you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Is that all? -That's all. [MUSIC PLAYING] -John! No! No! -You ought to have let me do it. I'm just a living corpse. -No, John, no. Don't talk like that. -One day you might regret that you stopped me from killing myself. -Who gave you the revolver? Was it Catherine? -No. It's been hidden in here for years, among the books. -May I help, Ma'am? -Thank you. I'll manage alone. [JOHN MAKES SMALL SOUNDS OF PAIN AS HE'S HELPED TO BED] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Charles. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Charles. Stop. Stop. I can't go on living this part anymore. I can't. I can't. I can't go on being the devoted nurse and the loving wife. You've got to put an end to it, Charles. I can't even bear to touch him. I hate him. Help me. Help me. I beg you to put an end to it, Charles. -It's impossible. You know that as well as I do. -I thought you loved me. I thought you would do anything in the world for me. -Anything? Yes. Not that. -But don't you see he's getting better? -No, he's not. The cure is a stimulant. It gives him occasional shots of vitality, but it doesn't alter the nature of his disease. Believe me, darling. We won't have to wait much longer. -You're lying. You said yourself a cripple can go on living for years and years. You are lying; aren't you? I can't stand it, I tell you. I can't stand it, Charles. I can't. You can just abandon it all and leave it. You can leave him. You can leave me. You can do anything you like. -I'll never leave you. -Then free me. Charles, if you don't do it, I'm going to. Do you hear? -No. No, Margaret. -Charles. I will. I swear it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TURNS ON MUSIC BOX] -We heard it at a restaurant in Copenhagen. It was the first time I met you, remember? So long ago. Nearly 13 years. The waiter insisted on presenting us with a bottle of Dutch gin. I was a real man then, a doctor building a reputation. Yes. And you? A beautiful, penniless young thing without a care in the world. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] How happy we were then. As happy as two children on holiday. -Don't move, darling, or I'll cut you. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] -Pour me some gin. -You know you shouldn't. -It brings back memories. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] -You have some too. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING] Good evening, Canon Owens. You look the picture of health. -Good evening Mr. Hitchcock. You too, my friend, are looking very well, I'm happy to say. -Yes. I owe it all to my dear, devoted wife and our good Dr. Livingstone. To the Dutch gin and to the memories evoked by a Viennese waltz. -Then since you are in such good spirits, Dr. Hitchcock, perhaps you will have patience enough to listen to me. Oh no. Thank you. I never drink. What I have to say is not altogether pleasant. -Out with it, Canon Owens. Have you come to tell me that the people are still gossiping about the devilish rites being conducted in the house of evil, crippled Dr. Hitchcock? CANON OWENS: Please, Dr. Hitchcock. You shouldn't treat this matter so lightly. What I mean to say is, the townspeople are saying that your experiments are directly connected to black magic. And you ought to remember that not very long ago they were victims. And they are also saying, Dr. Hitchcock, that the devil has set his mark on you. -So you also believe that I'm actually in league with the devil. Is that right, Canon Owens? -The devil is more real a person than our modern world would have it, Dr. Hitchcock. Come. Can't you forget these experiments? I appeal to you as a-- a man of science. Surely you should be the first one to despise superstition. -It is not superstition, Canon. I assure you. It is all basically scientific. -Well then, I warn you, Dr. Hitchcock. You are playing with forces which are best left alone. I entreat you. Confine yourself to your scientific studies like these here. -Don't touch that. That vial holds curare, one of the deadliest poisons. If even the slightest scratch on your hand were to be touched by it, you might have ended your days in a wheelchair like me. Usually curare kills, but in small doses it paralyzes. CANON OWENS: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I love you. Never forget that. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Just a minute, Charles. The queen moves to H7. -Checkmate. -Exactly. -If it weren't for the doctor with the injection hypodermic, I'd ask for my revenge. -I'm afraid, Dr. Hitchcock, it's getting late, and I think we ought to go now. Or else we'll have all the people in the town saying that the chief constable is neglecting his duties and the criminal activity is increasing in the county. And we wouldn't want that, now. Would we? -Don't forget that. -No, no, no. No fear of that. I'll see you tomorrow. JOHN: -Tomorrow? Who knows if I'll see tomorrow. When I was in Africa, a witch doctor said to me, the day will surely come when the bright sun will no longer shine over the forest. -Your medicine seems to put you in a bad mood. Why don't you give it up? Don't believe in medicine myself. As far as I'm concerned, I think it's an awful lot of nonsense. Not to me. I think that scientists should believe in their power to heal even cripples. CHIEF CONSTABLE: Perhaps you're right. Good night. -Good night, Dr. Hitchcock. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Be quick. Be quick. Give me the antidote. What's the matter, Charles? Give me the antidote. Please. Please, Charles. Please. I'm suffocating. [BELL TOLLS SIX TIMES] -It's been an hour since I gave the injection It should be over now. [FOOTSTEPS] CATHERINE: If you are waiting for Dr. Hitchcock, he's not coming. It's my fault. I'm sorry. He told me to say he was dining in his room tonight. [FOOTSTEPS] [BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -He's dead. He's been dead for more than an hour. CANON OWENS: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. For thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou annointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING THEN HOWLING] -Oh, Charles. Please, not now. -It's all right now. We've nothing more to fear. It's all over. [DOG STILL HOWLING] -I can't stand it. I wish he'd go away. -Margaret, what are you thinking of? You mustn't lose control. We knew it would be difficult, but remember we have each other. [DOG STILL HOWLING] -Oh, stop him, please. Make him stop. Make him stop. [DOG STILL HOWLING] [DOG GROWLS THEN IS QUIET] -Charles. [UNIDENTIFIED SOUNDS FROM OUTSIDE OF ROOM] What's that? [UNIDENTIFIED SOUNDS CONTINUE] [MUSIC PLAYING ] FAINT GHOSTLY VOICE: Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Margaret. Margaret. Margaret. MARGARET: [SOBBING] -Madam apologizes. She'll be down in a-- -How is she? -She's not too well, sir. It's changed. I wouldn't have thought her so sensitive. The master's death has upset her. And if I may take the liberty, sir? I don't think you should leave the house now. Madam needs your care. Please, Dr. Livingstone. Stay with her. She's taking it hard. -Yes, I'll stay. -Good morning, Canon Owens. Good morning, Dr. Fisher. -The last time I saw our poor friend was to say the night before his demise. He seemed strangely excited. Before our usual chess game, he insisted on dictating his last testament. Dowbridge. November 4, 1910. I, John Hitchcock, sound of mind, am dictating this-- my last will and testament-- to my solicitor, Mr. Albert Fisher of Fisher, Markley, and MacNab of 10 High Street, Dowbridge. Item one. I bequeath my house with all it contains and the land on which it stands to my wife, Margaret Hitchcock nee Whiteman as a token of gratitude for her affectionate assistance. On condition that she keep in her employment my governess, Catherine Wood, to the end of her days. Item two. 2/3 of the contents of my safe, bond shares, currency and jewels-- which is to say all that I have been able to save during my existence-- should be given to the home for orphan children directed by Canon Owens. In the recognition of the several instances in which his words as a friend and clergyman have brought balm to my troubled soul. The remaining third of my belongings shall become the property of my wife, who shall use them in any way she thinks fit. Item three. All the books and documents pertaining to the studies I have conducted during my lifetime will be denoted to the Institute of Psychic Research in London. That's all. Now Mrs. Hitchcock, if you would kindly proceed to open the safe in my presence. -The key is in the drawer of that desk, Mr. Fisher. You'll find it yourself by opening it. -There is no key here, Mrs. Hitchcock. -Strange. Catherine, do you know where the key might be? -No, ma'am. But I remember the master always kept it in that drawer. -There's no hurry, Mrs. Hitchcock. You can take your time. And if you think it necessary, Canon Owens and I can have the safe sealed. -Oh, good heavens. I wouldn't dream of it. FISHER: In that case, Mrs. Hitchcock, will ya kindly inform me as soon as ya find the key? Should it really be lost, we shall have to apply to the magistrate's for authority to have the safe forced. -Well? -Nothing. -And yet it must be. It's bound to be somewhere. -Damn! [MUSIC BOX BEGINS PLAYING] -No! -What is it, Catherine? -There's something I've got to tell you, ma'am. The master sometimes kept the key to the safe on his person. I saw him myself put the key in his vest pocket, a few days before he died. -Well, in that case it must still be in his coat. -Oh yes, ma'am. But it's the coat he was buried in. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, you see? John has the last laugh. -Bet 150,000 pounds in shares and jewels in that awful safe of John's? 60% of which is to go into the greedy hands of dear, Christian-minded, charitable Canon Owens. It's so funny when you think what we've risked together for the benefit of those poor orphans and dear Canon Owens. [LAUGHS] So terrible. Don't you think it's funny? -Stop it, Margaret Margaret! Margaret! Oh, the key's buried with him. Buried with him. Buried. -We can't force the safe. They'd find out. -Of course, not. -All we need is the key. Charles, I want that key. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING AND MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLES: It's the effect of the injections. They hasten decay. [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLES: Here's the key. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come along. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: [SIGHS] -Margaret. Margaret. We've got it. That's, That's all that matters. Let's open it. Come on. CATHERINE: Ma'am! -Darling, you must stop her. Don't let her come in. Go on. CATHERINE: Ma'am! Ma'am, excuse me. I was wondering-- [EXCLAMATION OF PAIN FROM MARGARET] -Oh! Did you hurt yourself, ma'am? How terrible. What happened? -No, it's nothing. What do you want? -Is Dr. Livingstone upstairs? -Yes. Why? -They're asking for him at the hospital. It's very urgent. -All right. I'll tell him. [EXCLAMATION OF PAIN] -Can I help you, ma'am? -It's all right, Catherine. -Let me help you. -No. Charles, they want you at the hospital. What's happened? -There's nothing there. CHARLES: I tell you there's nothing there. No money. No-- just papers and documents. [MARGARET SCREAMS AND SOBS] -Margaret. Stop it. Margaret. Margaret. Don't shout. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Calm yourself. Stop it. Come on. Get up. It'll be all right. We'll find it sooner or later. Sit down. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'll throw the key into the lake. [MUSIC PLAYING] I must go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [BELL TOLLS 12 TIMES] [A KNOCK] [A SQUEAK] [SOMETHING RATTLING] -Charles, is that you? [SOUNDS OF RATTLING AND CREAKY FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC PLAYING AND FOOTSTEPS CONTINUING] MARGARET: (SCREAMING) Charles! [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: I saw him. He was there. He was there. Behind the drapes. It was John. John. He was alive. I fired four or five times, but-- but he kept on coming. It was horrible. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOUND OF SOMETHING CREAKING] MARGARET: Listen. [PLUNKING MUSIC PLAYING WITH DROPS] -It's blood. It's blood. -I'm going to see what it is. There must be an explanation. -No, Charles. No! Please! -I must go. I won't be long. -I'm frightened, Charles. I'm frightened. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Must you sneak up on me like that? -Excuse me, ma'am. Canon Owens to see you. He is waiting for you downstairs. -What's he want? CATHERINE: I don't know. He didn't tell me. [FOOTSTEPS] -Good morning, Mrs. Hitchcock. -Good morning. Please sit down. -Oh, excuse me. Uh, we missed you in church today, Mrs. Hitchcock. Surely you haven't forgotten. -What? -The memorial service for your husband. You know, we live in a small community. And uh-- -Will you come to the point, Canon Owens? -Well, Mrs. Hitchcock, Dr. Livingstone's presence in this house was necessary during your husband's life, in view of the state of his health. But now-- you will understand-- a young, widowed lady. Alone in her deceased husband's house-- a man, even though he is a trusted friend of the family. -You mean the town would have it that Dr. Livingstone is my lover? -Oh, dear me, Mrs. Hitchcock. The thought never entered my mind. But I thought it my duty to warn you that gossip-- -Let them gossip, Canon Owens. I have other things on my mind. -I only meant well, Mrs. Hitchcock. -No doubt you did. Good day. -Good day. -Have you gone crazy? -What? -First you forget to attend a service in your husband's memory. Then the Canon comes, and you put his back up. You practically insulted him. -Charles, you seem to forget that it was he who insulted me by suggesting you were my lover. -The fact is it's the truth, my dear. And we don't want people to find out the truth. Do we? -I'm sorry, Charles. But what could I do? -You should have thought about it first. We're playing a dangerous game, Margaret. You know as well as I do what one more stupid move like that will bring us. -Darling, please don't turn against me now. -I'm not turning against you. If I would do that, I'd have done it a long time ago-- long before you dragged me down to this. -I dragged you? It was you who killed him. -Don't you ever say that again. Never. -Charles, you're hurting me. Stop it. -You wanted him dead. You pushed me into this. Margaret, forget it. My nerves must be going too. It's jarring coming back like this to these walls. He's much more between us now than he ever was alive. He's always here. I always feel him just over my shoulder. Sometimes I turn to try to catch him face to face, and he's not there. No one is. Hmmm. Oh, well. We're in this together. That's all that matters. -I'm going to go upstairs and try to get some sleep. -Remember, we must be very careful now. We're being watched. You, uh, you better go up and visit your husband's grave this afternoon. Take him some flowers, and be sure that someone sees you do it. -Just as you say, Charles. -I'm only saying it for our own good. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FROM MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD] -You really should try and eat something, ma'am. It's not good for you to go on day after day without having any food. -I don't want it. [MUSIC FROM MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD] -Shall I stay up and wait 'til Doctor Livingstone comes, ma'am? Do you want me to wait for Dr. Livingstone, ma'am? -Don't you hear it? Don't you hear it? -Hear what, ma'am? -You know perfectly well what. It's coming from upstairs. -I can't hear anything, ma'am. -You can. You're lying to me. [BEGINS TO SOB] -Ma'am! What's the matter? Ma'am! Ma'am! [MUSIC BOX MUSIC CONTINUES] [CLAP OF THUNDER] [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [SOUND OF WIND] MARGARET: [GASP OF SURPRISE] [SOUND OF WIND CONTINUES] [THUNDER] [SOUND OF WIND CONTINUES] [THUNDER] [THUNDER] MARGARET: [GASP OF SURPRISE] -This was the master's favorite snuffbox. I found it in Dr. Livingstone's room. [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET (VOICEOVER): Yes, I remember now. The safe was already open when Catherine called. And I left him alone. No. It's impossible. But the snuffbox must have been in the safe. Oh, how stupid I've been. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GHOSTLY LAUGHTER CAN BE HEARD] JOHN (GHOSTLY VOICE): I know what you are looking for, Margaret. But it's not here. It's not here. -John? -Well, Margaret, it's not here. It's hidden under the coffin. That's the hiding place-- under the coffin. Under the stone slab. It's waiting for you. It's, It's there. All you've ever wanted. Jewelry, money, Margaret-- wealth, more than you've ever dreamed of. All that you've ever longed for, Margaret. All. All that you've ever longed for. [EXHALED BREATH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOUND OCCURS ] [OWL HOOTS] [OWL HOOTS AGAIN] [OWL YET AGAIN] [MUSIC PLAYING] -[EXLAMATION OF PAIN] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: [SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Why are you spying on me like that? -Somebody got to it before you did. -Who is doing these tricks? Who is it? Who is it? -That's not hard to understand. Who lives in this house besides you and me? It's very clear. Isn't it? -No. -There's no one else; is there? -Charles. -Margaret, I'm leaving here. -Why? -Because I finally realized that everything we hoped for is being gradually destroyed. Even if we found that money and could get away from here, we'd be too late. We would only go on destroying each other. I'm sorry, but-- -No. What's done cannot be undone, you said so yourself not very long ago. -That's right. But I can get out before more evil is done-- before we complete destroy each other. -Why these silly qualms of conscience all of a sudden? -I feel like a man waking from a dream. And I realize now, for the very first time, what we've done. -Charles, please don't go away. -I'll do what I have to do, Margaret. -Charles, everything I've done has been to have you with me forever. That's all I've ever wanted out of life. Don't leave me alone, Charles. -We are both alone now, Margaret. Perhaps forever. Don't you understand that? Being together would be like living in a nightmare. -But I love you, Charles. I can't live without you. -It's too late for love and feeling. You once loved your husband; didn't you? Well, that's all over and done with now. But you'll forget me, just like you've forgotten the other. -But that's not true! I love you! No, Charles! [MUSIC PLAYING] -And I didn't believe her. I didn't believe my own eyes. -Margaret, I didn't know about this. -Yes. -You don't think that I-- -What should I think? What should I think, Charles? It's all quite clear now. Ever since the very first thing when I left you alone with the safe. -Are you crazy? I'm not a thief. -Oh, yes, you are a thief! You've deceived me! -What are you talking about? -You're a liar! -I've got to know what you're talking about! I swear I didn't take them! Margaret! -No! Leave me alone! -Stop it! No, Margaret! Stop it, will you? You crazy? I swear I didn't take them. I didn't know they were in my bag. So now you'll be convinced it's best we split up. [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLES: -No! [SCREAMS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHARLES GROANS SEVERAL TIMES] [MUSIC PLAYING] -[GROANS SEVERAL TIMES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOUND OF GLASS SHATTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MATCH BEING STRUCK] [MUSIC PLAYING] -[SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SOUND OF MUSIC BOX PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAP OF THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -[MOANS] [SOUND OF DOOR CREAKING OPEN ] [SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARGARET: John. -Margaret, you're trembling. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Perhaps you weren't expecting me. You should be accustomed to my materializing by now. MARGARET: Oh. -But this time it's really me, Margaret-- alive and kicking. [MARGARET IS BREATHING HEAVILY] -Just feel how strong my grip is. But I won't kill you. No. It would be too easy, my dear, for you to escape your punishment that way. When you were in the tomb, you cut yourself when you opened the jewel case; didn't you? Well, I smeared the hasp with poison. Curare. It paralyzes, you know. And now you'll be tied to that wheelchair like I was. And I'll be far away enjoying my wealth, which you and that poor idiot Charles were looking for so desperately. [CHUCKLES] I had it all the time. Oh, I forgot to tell you. You were wrong about Charles. He didn't take the jewels. Catherine put them in his bag. [CHUCKLES] He really loved you. I planned it all. It was Catherine who loaded the revolver with blank cartridges when you shot at my "ghost." But when you so kindly fainted, she shot a few bullets into the wall, and you went crazy with fear. You know, it all started when I realized I was really getting better. I wanted to bring you the good news, and I found you in the arms of Charles, on the floor. You decided to get rid of me. But I replaced the curare with a liquid which produced apparent death, putting another corpse in my coffin. Causing you to look feverishly for the estate. Persecuting you incessantly, night and day. [RINGS BELL] Appearing to you as a psychic materialization was all very simple. Wasn't it, Catherine? Have you prepared everything for our departure, Catherine? -Yes, sir. -Perfect. Thank you for all you've done for me. You've been a great help. -Thank you. -Go now. [FIVE GUNSHOTS] -Oh. Oh. -I had to do it. There will be no witnesses. Margaret, one last favor, darling. Your fingerprints on the revolver butt, thank you. Now you'll be accused of her death too. [LAUGHS] Poor, Catherine. When she called the police for me, she didn't realize she was asking them to come here to investigate-- not Charles' death-- but her own. [LAUGHS] Amusing; isn't it? Soon, my darling, you will be completely paralyzed. [SOUND OF CLOCK TICKING] The police. They've arrived. I shall have to leave you, my dear, before I expected. I apologize. I apologize profoundly. Ah. My faithful Dutch friend, gin. I see that you're cultivating my habits. You've poured yourself a glass. Your good health. Or rather, your ill health. And to our memories of Copenhagen. [CHUCKLES] Ah. Pity you didn't know there was a secret passage in this room. We would have met, quickly. [LAUGHS] [MARGARET BEGINS TO LAUGH] -[GASPS] I'm suffocating. [GASPS FOR BREATH SEVERAL TIMES] -That bottle there, on the table. Give me that bottle. It's the antidote. We can still save ourselves. Help me. Margaret, please. Give me the-- the antidote, Margaret. -Oh. There. -We'll save ourselves. We'll save ourselves. Give it to me. -There. -Ah! [MARGARET LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [JOHN STRUGGLES TO BREATHE] [MARGARET LAUGHS] -Take her away. [MARGARET CONTINUES TO LAUGH] [CLAP OF THUNDER] [MARGARET CONTINUES TO LAUGH] [SOUND OF SOMEONE KNOCKING] -I told you Dr. Hitchcock, the devil is a very real person. [MUSIC PLAYING]
