If you think I'm gonna sit here and take all instructions from you, then you have another thing coming. All these years, wasted years. Sticking with you all these years. What about the case? What about the case? Don't even go there with me. Because if you do, I will fight you with everything I've got. Oh, is that so? They've started again. They've started again. Hey, hey. - God help me. - They've started. Yeah, go on, go on. Marrying you was the biggest mistake of my life. Well, then correct the mistake. - What, you think I'm gonna beg you? - You don't have the brains to beg. God, you're such a bitch. I'd rather be a bitch than a coward. Imagine, both of you, fighting like market women in the presence of your children and your guests, over what? Flight tickets to Paris. Sir, this trip was not on the budget your daughter and I agreed. So what? It's a school trip, and I can afford it. They don't need to go on a trip to France. You're spoiling them. You will not stop me from giving the best to our children. Oh, I'm in trouble. When you decide whether you want us to go to Paris or not, let us know. In the meantime, we will be downstairs with our friends at our party. My eyes have seen things. You see that? This kind of nonsense will make your children to disrespect you. Exactly. - Ah! - Let's just face reality. We have tried. We have failed. - Ah! - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Toyo. - Try? So you people are thinking of divorce? These children will put us in trouble! - No, no, no. - You, please, don't put us, please. These children... Divorce? No! Toyo! Toyosi, is that what you really want? Is that what you want? - Mama, I have tried. We have tried. - Then try harder! - Try harder! - Toyosi. Remember, your father abandoned me and you when you were young. Now you want to do the same? Toyosi, please don't do this to me! Okay, okay, we'll... we'll try again. Now you are talking. Now you are coming. Eh? Eh? You... Just a little effort, and you people will throw all this divorce nonsense behind you. - Exactly. - Someone save me. I don't think this is ordinary. It's spiritual. Now you're talking. And... both of them need deliverance. - Now you're talking. - I know what to do. True talk. Ah! I walked in... I walked in to find him watching a blue film. Bolanle. He was... Leave me alone! He... He was... He was touching himself. Kayode! A blue film? That was not enough, then you went ahead to touch yourself, Kayode? No... No, no, no, no, you need to talk to me truthfully. You need to talk to me truthfully. You need to understand what happened to Ananias and Sapphira. The light and... You know what happened to them? You need to tell the whole truth. Useless, useless man, answer! - Talk to me. - Answer. Eh? A little one. - Ah! - Ah, Kayode, go on your knees. Don't touch me, useless man. - Bolanle... - You need to pray. Say, "Temptation, flee from me." - Temptation, flee from me. - Ah! Temptation, flee from me in Jesus's name. - Temptation, flee from me... - Say, "Flee!" Flee, flee away! Ah, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray. Temptation, flee from me. Bolanle, there must be something that you are not doing right. Is it that you are not giving him enough? You need to keep praying. Temptation, flee from me. - Pastor, everything he wants, I give him. - No. I'm doing everything, giving him everything. You are not giving him... Bolanle, you are not giving him. You need to learn to give him the front, the back, the back back. - Yes. - The other hole, like the other room. Huh? That is where the problem is. You are not giving him enough. I know what you... Open your mouth and say, "Temptation flee from you. The grace to give him everything." The grace to give me everything... The grace to give... Say your own line. Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray! On your knees, with your head down. Your matter is serious in my heart. Temptation, flee from me. - Temptation, flee from me. - Yeah, pray, pray, pray, pray. - Temptation, flee from me. - Keep praying. Temptation... - Hello? - The grace to give him everything. - Baby. - Sister Uche. - The grace to give me everything. - Yes. I will see your children. The grace to give him everything. - Tomorrow? - The grace to give him everything. - Temptation, flee from me. - Okay, okay. Let's say tomorrow evening. Uh-huh. God bless you. You are blessed. - Thank you, Pastor. - Toyosi. Ah! Uh, Pastor Theophilus will see both of you tomorrow evening. Good, this is a great thing, eh? I even heard your pastor has ministry for married couples. Yes. Both of you will go tomorrow. And he will talk with you, eh? Everything will be fine. - No divorce. Not in this present life. - Toyosi. Our wife, I'm begging you in God's name, please. You are the man here. You see us, me and your mama, we've been going... - Toyosi. - Ma? - Take it easy, please. My wife. - Yes, ma. - Thank you. It is well, eh? - Thank you. - God will do it. - Yes, ma. Hey, Ebere, thank you for allowing Yetunde to use your place for the bridal shower. Thank you so much. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. What is wrong with you? What? What is this? It's just a bridal shower. Oh, really? Are you the one hosting? - I thought not. - Look, I'm sorry, okay? She's my mother. I couldn't say no. Very well. If you don't want it to happen, I'll call her and let her know. - Oh, so she can blame me, right? - What do you want from me? - Seriously, what? - Forget it. Wake your brother up. You don't want to be late. Now! - Can I have some eggs? - No. I said no. I can't ask you for eggs, and you're taking my own eggs. What is this? You're still not ready? Pancakes as requested, guys. Hello, sweetie. You knew I had an early meeting. What is this? I know. Um... I'm sorry, I'll drop them. Sweetie, pass me your plate, go on. And syrup on the way, I'll be right back. Thank you. It'd be better if they got a divorce, right? What? You know I'm right. I'm right. Gentlemen, we have a strong offer. In the following week, we will engage with them and seek to close with minimal adjustment to the big prize. Thank you. Oh, Kehinde, I didn't know you'd be coming in today. Yes, Ebere is getting us set for the investor meeting. - Is she good, eh? - She's amazing. - Thank you. - That's how we do at Capital Alliance. Okay, I'll see you in church on Sunday. - Hey. - Is anything wrong? Um... Tomorrow is market day, and our weigh-in sensor actually broke down. How late are you going to be? A little, we're almost done weighing, though. Oh, there I was, thinking that was the job of the farm manager. Aw, what did Mommy say? Can you stay out and play? Mommy wants to know why my manager can't stay to oversee the weigh-in. Oh, and did you tell her that your farm manager told you about the faulty weight bridges about three weeks ago, and is not canceling her dinner plans for you? I could threaten to fire you, you know. As if I'm not the one doing you a favor by working here. Whatever, just say me well to Seyi and have a wonderful dinner, okay? I will. Did you go in? Ebere, are you going to be like this? If you're gonna be like this, why are we even bothering? Oh, I'm sorry, I was the one who walked in two hours late. I told you I was going to be late. Toyosi, in what world is two hours a little late? Jeez... Ah, your mother is such a great friend, a wonderful woman of God. And I'm surprised that you're here for counseling when you have such a wonderful woman in your life. I want to believe that it's just because of the saying that the prophet is never respected in his hometown. Right? Ah... Okay, so can you guys tell me about yourselves and how long have you been married? Seventeen years now, Pastor. - Seventeen years? - Yes. You've been married 17 years and you are this young? Wow, were you guys ten years old when you got married? We were in NYSC, sir. NYSC! Corper love! Sweet and interesting. I remember my year in NYSC. It was full of escapades with women, until God arrested me. And so you guys decided to make it forever? Um, not quite, it was a... Oh, it was a drunken one-night stand. I got pregnant. And you had a boy or a girl? - Twins. - Twins, double for your troubles. Uh-uh. Any more after that? Ah, you guys decided to wait? It just never seemed like the right time, that's all. Don't tell me that, with this beautiful woman here. There could have been nights of accidental discharge once or twice. Pastor, this is very inappropriate. Inappropriate? Uh-uh, uh-uh... Ebere, your mother would have told you that when it comes to marriage, sex is never inappropriate, and this is a marriage counseling session. We go deep into what sex is about. We talk about it, we discuss it. You will have noticed that the man of God you are seeing doesn't joke with sex, eh? Or do you find it offensive because I asked your husband to have sex with you? - Don't you want to have sex with him? - Right, I'm leaving. Oh, but before you leave, I believe we can share a word of prayer. And I want to believe God will do something. Let us pray. I'd love to have your hands. Can you see it? Jeez, I don't believe this. Oh, let me have your hand. Ebere, let me have your hand. And you both should hold each other's hands. Hold your hands. Father, we thank you. For Toyosi and Ebere, we thank you. We thank you for... the first 17 years. We thank you because there are challenges and we know that you will bring solutions. We thank you because we know that restoration has started, and I want to pray that you will give them the grace to understand each other. You will give them divine understanding, and all that they need to make their marriage work. Tonight, visit them, Father. Bring the understanding that we crave for. For we pray in the name - of the almighty God, in Jesus's name. - Amen. - I can't hear your amen. - Amen. - Just say, "Amen." - Amen. - We agreed to work on things. - I don't see the point. Going back to that man is not working on things. Just remember... I tried. Daddy, why are you wearing Mommy's dressing robe? Toyosi, Toyosi, what is this? Toyosi, wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, look at me! What is this, look at me, look at me, eh? Wake up! What, look, look, look, look, look. What the hell is going on? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know, you tell me. You tell me, what, what, what? What happened? - Are we dreaming? - No. Are we dreaming? Tell me we're dreaming, tell me. Ah! Oh, oh, oh, what's this, now? Wake up, wake up, wake up! - Are we dreaming? Are we dreaming? - No! - No! - Tell me we're dreaming... You're not going to faint. You're not going to faint on me. Wake up, my friend. What is this now? Huh? - What is this, what is this? - Look! What is going on? Nothing is going on. Go back to your room and go get ready. Don't tell me nothing. You ran out of my room screaming. Well, then, go back to your room and go get ready. Hey, hey, don't give me that look. Don't... Don't give me that look. We shouldn't be worrying about Ireti's feelings or emotional feelings. We have more important things to worry about. For instance, getting out of this body, getting you out of my body. Could it be the pastor? What, that pastor? That pastor can perform this miracle? - Who else could it be? - This is insane. We have to go see him, come on. - Come on, we have to go see him. - Yes, we have to go and see him. - Oh, my God. - I swear, I am going to kill him. I'll kill him, I'll kill him. Oh, Satan, leave me alone ♪ I belong to Jesus Leave me, leave me Oh, so good to see you guys again, I never thought I would see you guys again. Even me, too, I didn't think I was going to see you, Pastor, what have you done? Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it! No, let me ask him. What have you done? What have you done to us? Your wife was the angry one. Yes, you thought right. I am the angry one. Um, you can excuse us. Okay, sir. - Ebere, you need to calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. - Baby. - I don't want to calm down. I need to really understand what is happening. Wow! This is God's miracle, and it is fascinating. - Fascinating? - Yes! So you think this, you think... - Stop it! - Let me slap him. - Calm yourself down! - Fascinating? So you think this is fascinating, right? You think I care about fascination? Fix it, please! How do I do that? How do you do that? Is it not your prayer that got us into this? Fix it! You'd better fix it! You came to me for prayer so that both of you can understand each other, and God answered. - So you think this is... - Oh! You think it's funny, right? You think it's funny? - Stop it, calm down! - Useless man. This is an opportunity for both of you to understand the reason why you're married to each other. Really? This will not work. We cannot live like this. This is so messed up. Useless pastor, he's talking about this... You need to get a hold of yourself. No, I need to get my body back. That's what I need. - What if he's right? - Right about what? That we cannot change until we understand each other? What else are we to do? Tell me. - We need to spend time together. - No, I can't! Don't you get it, I can't. Today is management's presentation to preferred billers, and I can't... - You need to be there. - Oh. You must be there. Let's go, let's go. No, no, you drive. Let's go, let's go. Okay, let's go. I can't, there's no way you expect me to do it. That's my transaction. Plus, it'd get me partner. I get that it's important. Doesn't mean I can do it. Don't worry about it, don't worry. I'll talk you through it, eh? Just tell Idris that, okay, you're not feeling too well, and let him do the talking, okay? That's just it. It's nothing. It's nothing serious of a meeting. I'm sure you'll be able to handle it. It's Jumoke from work. Answer it. - What should I tell her? - Just answer it. - Hello? - Where are you? I'm at home, I'm not feeling too well. Better get well. Auntie Ayo is here waiting for you. What does she want? Your eyes, close. Close. Close, close, close, close... Wait, wait, wait, there. Yeah. Now, let's. Please. - What? - What's this, now? Wait, wait. - Ow! - Easy. Ow! It... But it does hurt. - Stop, just wait! - Ow, stop! - Hey, put your head in one place. - Ow! Would you stop scattering it. What's the matter with you? Ow! Ow, no, no, no. I can't, I can't. It hurts. Ow! No, no, no, no, not like this. You're not going to my office like this. Looking like this, like so funky. And take this one off, too. - Really, stop... - Sit down. I said that I'll do it myself. Go away. Put your hand this way. You see what we go through? Really? I'm done with you. Go on, change. Wait, give me your hand. Give me your hand. You have to let me wear flats. I do not have any flats. Put the hand down, put it down. - This one, you know. - Like this? - Yes, and then just... - I'm gonna fall and break my head. No, you won't. You'll be fine, okay? - You'll be fine. - Okay. - Put it down. - Okay. No. Ah! Yes. Hmm! Go on, change. I can't run your farm. I can't even negotiate fishes. Look, I can't breathe in this dress, I can barely walk in these heels, my face is numb, but I tried! I know! Come on, Toyosi... I mean, Ebere... You know, whatever! Look, what do you expect me... I expect you to try for me like I do for you? Yes! No, no, not that. No, no. Silly me. - That's not the help I need from you! - Whoa! Okay. I'll do it. - Where have you been? - Huh? - Where have you been? - Uh... family emergency. She's going to punish us and pressure. But take it, because we need to move the stock. Okay. - Why are you walking like that? - Like how? Like you're on a runway. You're wasting Auntie Ayo's time. Please be fast. - Are you not coming? - Of course not, you know she hates me. Huh. Ah, Auntie Ayo, good afternoon. Good afternoon, ma. Why are you so late, Toyosi? Sorry, I am so sorry. I had a family emergency. - A family emergency? - Yes, ma. What does my business have to do with your family emergency? Why are you doing this nonsense? Are the fish meant for your family? Can you finish it? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma. Save your apologies. How much are you selling for? Tell me how much, instead of staring like an albino! 500 naira. Toyosi, what am I buying? Yes, okay. Uh, good morning, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for coming. Sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm a little bit under the weather. Idris will take the presentation. And I'll be here. I'll be here to answer any questions. Yes. Hello, good afternoon, so we're taking the Geltech proposal. I am not trying to buy your entire office. All I'm asking is the price of fish. How much is it? Five hundred naira, per kilogram. For what? Get out of my way! Debtor! You wouldn't dare buy it at that price. Rescue me! - That was fast. - Eh? You're normally with her for hours. What did you guys settle? It cannot be less than 42. She just left. I don't understand. What does that mean? She's not buying. What are we going to do with all the fish? So, like I was saying... this could be a lot of profit for you. We believe that we can make it hopefully more profitable by... by looking towards the kind of advertising, the way that you guys look up towards the 21st century. You guys seem to agree with me. I believe that this could be a lot of profit for you. - Uh, sorry, sir. - I'm running out of stuff to say now. Family emergency. Oh, sorry. Hey. What? What? Hey, who is that? Sorry, ladies, sorry. Sorry, sorry, my bad, my bad. What happened? We closed the deal at 450 per kilo. What? 450? I'm losing money selling at that price. What did you want me to do? You told me you had to sell it. Fine, I have to go back to your meeting. We have a problem, we have a problem. Auntie Ayo, Auntie Ayo... I am so sorry, ma. Auntie, please. Don't be offended, Please, I beg you, I'm really sorry. We've had this relationship for years now, several years. Let's not use one small thing and spoil it, please, eh? So there is a little sense in your head. - Yes. - I thought it was empty in there. Sorry. - What you have said is true. - Ah, thank you, ma. A long-standing relationship should not be ruined by little things. - Oh, yes. - Now talk to me. How much do you want to sell the fish for? Um... I, um... I take it it went well? You left a boy barely old enough to shave in charge of a presentation to the most important potential investor, and you have the audacity to come and ask how it went? Why is he not shooting? - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Dad. Do you want to join us? The Hungarian guys on our team suck balls. Watch your language my dear, what's that? And wait, are you not supposed to be doing your homework? - Ah, Daddy. - What? Did Mommy give you the "you must be a more responsible adult" talk again? Ireti... upstairs, your homework, now. Definitely got the talk. Hi, guys, what are we playing? Nothing, going to do homework. Was it something I said? I don't know. We need to talk. All we have to do is get the ShopRite contract. What ShopRite contract? We're trying to become ShopRite's supplier of fresh fish. Oh, that's brilliant. I mean, that would cut off the likes of Auntie Ayo. - Yeah, thanks. - Yeah. You know, we're in the final stages of testing the processing equipment. Hopefully, it will be ready by the end of the month when they come to visit. Shit! What? Shit, I'm the engineer on the project. If anything goes wrong, what do we do? - You could... - Dad, I've defrosted the steaks. I think I'll try that tonight. What is the matter with you? Can't you see we're talking? What have you done? What do you mean, what have I done? She knows better than to barge in on us now. I will thank you not to disrupt my relationship with our daughter. Ireti? Ireti, come back, please. I am so sorry, sweetheart. Dad had a really bad day at work. It's fine. You know what? I know how important steak night tradition is to both of you. But Dad can't prepare dinner tonight, so we'll go to Aer for dinner. - Really? - Yes. Yay, thanks, Dad! I said it, why did she hug you? Welcome to my world. Um, I like my steak well done, please. Thank you. Why are you having each other's orders? - Counseling. - What does that mean? The counselor said that we should... - walk in each other's shoes. - Yes, yes. And you decided to start with steak? - Why not? Baby steps. - Baby steps. - Mom? - Yes. - Can you go to the bathroom with me? - Sure, let's go, um. Oh, oh. No, this is not one of the roles you get to switch. - Indeed, yes. - Sure, sure, indeed. Okay, let's go. Hey. So, how was school today? It was okay, I spoke to Debbie today. Oh, yeah, Debbie... What Debbie? Oh, Victor's daughter. Oh, she's a nice one, that one. Yeah, she is. - Mom! - Yeah? - What do you need? - Do you have any tampons? - Mom! - Why don't you have any? Because I didn't think I was coming out today. Besides, it wasn't supposed to start until tomorrow. Right, oh! Why don't you use tissue? Really, Mom? Tissue on the first day of flow? So what do you need? Can you please get me a pad? Sure, sure, sure. Your daughter wants a pad. It's not funny. - Yes, it is. - Yes, it is a little funny. But what do I do? Well, go to the pharmacy and get her... Get her, go, go, take... - The pharmacy? - Yeah, the pharmacy, go, go. Right, okay. Hey. - Where are you going with all of this? - I didn't know which one to get. What do you mean, you got all of this? You bought the whole entire pharmacy? Take it, that's enough. Take! - Okay, okay. - Go, go, go. - Give me the bag, give me the bag. - Oh! Oh, here, have it. - Hey, wait, wait, sorry. - What! Sorry, one more thing. What happened between Debbie and Okey? What did you say to him? Nothing, I just said she's a nice girl. That nice girl was his girlfriend until last week when she kissed another boy! - No. - Yes. Why didn't you tell me? How was I supposed to know he didn't tell you? - He didn't. - Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, go take of our daughter. We'll talk about this later. Okay, okay, all right. You like the food? Look, it was very nice of you to have talked to Debbie, okay? I, um... I don't want to talk about it. Yeah, sure, sure, of course. What? And you couldn't tell me? I didn't think it was a big deal. He's your boss. Really? Look, we need to fix this before you destroy my life any further. - I destroy your life? - Yes. Are you joking? No, I followed your instructions to the letter, absolute... Can you please argue a little lower? We're trying to sleep! Who the hell do you think you're talking to? - My soon-to-be divorced parents. - Huh? - Come... - Where are you going? What do you mean, where am I going? We can't have her talk like that. Ireti's upset because we're fighting, and you want to punish her? Look, Ebere, I wasn't brought... I mean, Toyosi, I wasn't brought up like that. Do you understand? You know, whatever. Tomorrow, you take the day off, okay? We're going to get to the bottom of this. I'm getting my body back. No, I'm not doing. I said I'm not doing it. You don't even know what I want. Mm-hmm. You want me to pick your children. Actually, we want you to stay with them after you pick them up. Ha! Ebere, because I don't have a life, right? I'm trying to save my marriage here. Since when? He'll do it. Sir, ma'am, we are ready for you. What is this? Normally, our guests like to shower together. - Ah. - Enjoy. Um... no, no, no, I don't... I don't think so. - Think about it. - About what? What's more understanding than sex? What's the worst that can happen? Come on. Well, you see, the worst that can happen is that it's going to happen. - Stop, okay. - No, no. - Sorry, sorry. - Okay. - Which way? - Um... let me turn around? - Okay, good, good, yes, turn. - Okay. Can you... Can you bend down? - No, stop, that hurts. - What do you mean? - Stop it, ow! - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh, gosh, that is really painful, don't do that. - Was that the wrong hole? - Stop! Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Okay, one more time, let's just try it. - Okay. Yeah, to the side, can you lift your legs up a bit? No, yeah. It hurts. Oh, gosh, you know what? It's not gonna work. Let's never speak of this again. How do you walk with this thing inside you? - Carefully. - Ugh! You need to get here now. She wants me to come to the office. It has to be an emergency with the feed processor. - She won't call otherwise. - There's nothing we can do. We can just tell them. Look, without the ShopRite contract, my company dies. Well, maybe it should. You want to get into this now? Look, the man that took the job that you turned down in Total is now a director, do you know? Can we not have another conversation on how much of a failure I am? Oh, no, no, no, you're not. You see, you just settle for mediocre when you could've been world-class. I remember when you wanted me to be happy. I want the best for you and the family. No. You want me to be someone else. Where are you going? Ebere, is everything okay? We need to talk. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So Toyosi, this is you? So who did your makeup? And how did you... - Your breasts... - Stop! - Wear a bra, Toyosi. - It's not funny. Well, what do I call you? I don't understand. I'm confused. So you're transformed or transgender? - What? - Are you done laughing? - You even wear... - Stop it! - Sorry. - Are you done laughing? I don't understand. I've never seen this kind of thing before. I'm... - You know you're an idiot, right? - I'm sorry. Okay, I'm done. - It's not funny. - Okay, sorry. It's the same thing now. It overheated on the run. Simple, we'll buy a new one when we get the contract. - We need it to work to get the contract. - That's why I'm here now. I mean, I don't know if I can fix it like this, but... This is just crazy. Let's go. Let's go. Can you walk in these shoes? Let's go. It's hard, but I'm trying. See, the boss couldn't make it, so he recommended somebody else. It's a woman that eventually showed up. It's a lie. Is it by her breasts that you know she's a woman? It's all yours. Ah! My in-law in-law, Toyo Toyo. Why aren't you at your sexy, romantic vacation? Well, Ebere has gone to work. Trust my sister to find a way to work during a getaway, eh? Yes, I know. A fine brother like you. I don't know why you worry yourself. Leave that woman and come with me. I'll take you at once. Please! Please! Please! Shut up, shut up. See who wants to accept someone, huh? As if I'd make him leave my sister to follow a clumsy person like you. - See your face... - Idiot! It's you that's clumsy. Yeah, yeah, don't mind her. I remember telling you going to that pastor would not work. It wouldn't work. Do you see, Toyosi, take my advice and be done. Emeka, you give so much advice, I don't know which you speak of anymore. Are you okay? Why do you like to crack all of these dry jokes when nobody needs them? - Joke how? - Eh, eh, eh, see. My sister loves you, that's a fact. But you need to leave her. - Huh? - I've told you. I've told you. She thinks it was a huge mistake to marry you. You need to change her mind. So... So how will leaving her do that? How would it happen? From my observation, I believe she loves you more. But until you leave her, she won't realize what she's lost. - She won't be able to realize it. - Wonderful. - But that doesn't make any sense. - This is the reason I get angry with you. "But that doesn't make any..." So you keep saying. Okay, you can live your life like that. See you later, eh? Are you sending me out? You're sending me home? Should I buy groundnuts for you? Do you not see customers waiting? Fine brother, come, I will accept you. Prostitute! Shut up! Shut up your mouth! Who called you? - Did I block your way? - Brother. Brother, come, come, come, please. Long time, welcome, eh? Welcome. It works. Madam... very good. Very good. Hey, hi. - I still have a company. Sorry. - Don't be like that, please? Oh, well, don't worry. Only Jumoke knows about us, and she won't tell anybody. - Should I come help you with your samples? - No, thank you, I figured it out. I'm trying to apologize. That would usually require you to say, "I'm sorry." I saw my brother today. He really likes you, so much so, he's telling you to leave me. It's been a long day. I think we should go see Pastor Theophilus again. Yeah, whatever. My brother was right. I do love you. Thank you so much, Pastor, for your advice. It changed my marriage. You don't need to thank me, eh? You thank God. You can't go in there, please. You can't go in. Can we talk? I'll see you guys later. This is for you. What is this? That is your expo into each other's lives. What does that even mean? It means you'll be in constant conversation with each other. Sometimes by text. Sometimes by phone. And eventually, you would have become so entwined with each other, you won't know where you end and where your spouse begins. Are you sure this will work? Ah! I'm very sure it will help your marriage. And for the rest, let's leave it up to God. Okay, we will try it. Thank you, Pastor. Now that you've agreed to try it, that will cost you 100,000. - Huh? - Ah! You think all this was free? It don't come free in the market. We got that from tithe payer's money, and we have to put it back. The Lord bless you. So that's it, his grand plan to get you guys back in your bodies is phones with headsets? - Yep. - That sounds ridiculous. Yep. So why are you doing it? Because it actually works. Ugh. Please, answer the phone. It's been ringing since... I hope I'm not expected to wear this. This is ridiculous. - It's your mom. - Huh? - Your mom. - Uh, no, you answer it. - What? - Answer it. - No, no, no. - No, no, no, you answer it. No, you answer it. - So she's gonna hear my voice? Answer it. - You want to break my phone for it now? - What do I say? - Um, "Hello"? "Mom, Mom." Just say, "Mom. Hello, Mom." Hello? Yeah, Mom. Oh! What? What? - No, no way. - Yep. So what did you do? Um, well... This stupid bridal shower that I said I was not going to... Do it. No, no... - No, no, no, no! - Yes. There is no way I'm doing this, no! Oh, my gosh. You cannot say no to your mama, you know. I can't believe this! No, no, no, let's fix this. Let's fix this. I'm not gonna do it, I'm not. I swear I'm not gonna do it. Yes, you are. You can't say no to your mama, and you know... Stop it! You're having too much fun. Yes, I am. This is one prayer I really thank God for answering for me. Honestly, good Lord have mercy! You know what, I hate you! I hate you, I hate you! I'm not gonna do it. Jesus Christ! I can see what we're gonna wear right there. Thank you so much for doing this, ma. If you would just move, and let me get started. - Ugh, I hate girls like that. - Who doesn't, huh? Her know-it-all attitude meant that she did everything. She set everything up. He didn't even have to raise a finger. Wow. So you didn't need the phones? Oh, yes, we did. We sure did. Bride-to-be! Okay, ladies, are you having fun? Yes! Of course you're having fun. I organized it. Anyways, we are playing Five Questions. - And we're starting with... hey, beautiful! - Not me. Not you, definitely. Auntie Ebere! Come on. Come on! Auntie Ebere, Auntie Ebere... Sit your fine self down. Hello. Oh, yourself, pick one. Oh, wait, wait, wait. So it doesn't come easy. Here you go. Uh-uh, uh-uh, no sneak peek. Drum roll! Okay, I like this one. So... Questions about sex in marriage. Question number one, what is your favorite sex position? - Tell us! - I'll be right back. Huh? Oh, you. Why'd they give me sex questions? Duh, it's a bridal shower. What do you expect? No, those girls... Stop! Those girls are too young to ask such questions. Just go ahead and answer the questions, for goodness' sake. That's all it takes. Okay, so they want to know what your favorite sex position is. Really? - I guess I should know that one. - You think? Auntie, is everything okay in there? Yes, yes, everything is fine. She's coming. She's on her way. - I'm not going! - Yes, you are. Okay, you know what? Take this, I'll talk you through it. - Help me fix it... - No, shh! Go, go, go! How do you fit in this dress? Ah! Oh, my God. What a life! So. - Hello there. - Where were we? - Favorite sex position. - Yes. - Reverse cowgirl. - What? - We never do that. - I know. Sorry, reverse cowgirl. Okay, okay, okay, settle down, ladies. Relax, look at you. Okay, relax, relax. Question number two... Who's nervous? Have you ever... Like, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever faked an... orgasm? - No. - Be honest. Yes. - Yes? - How is this a surprise to you? I knew it, I knew it. I mean, Uncle Toyosi must be so amazing in bed for you to have never faked an orgasm. - We all do that. - Well, yes. Auntie Ebere, you better guard your husband because Georgina here is about to be number two. Don't listen to her. That's not funny. Well, it kinda might be. Anyways, who's next? It sounds like you guys actually had a good time. Yeah, you should have seen his tissue dress. - Oh my God. It was so bad! - I can't imagine. - Oh, man. - It's... I take it back. The pastor does know. Oh, wait, wait, hold on. - Hey, what's up? - They want me to go to an investor dinner. What happened? They want him... they want me... to go to an investor's dinner. So what's the problem? He's going to be having conversations about finance. Ugh, that's bad. So why don't you join him? He just doesn't go for these things. He never goes for these things, that's the problem. Oh, there's a first time for everything now. Yeah, I guess I'll just drop off the kids and join him. Hmm, I guess. Hey, honey, how are you? How was school today? Only Mom calls me honey. Yeah, um... Yeah, we're still playing the opposite thing. - Oh. - Yeah, where's Ireti? - Bathroom. - Oh, okay. Was that Debbie trying to talk to you? I, uh... I don't want to talk about it. Yeah, yeah, I understand. You know what? Let me tell you a story. When your mother was your age, right? She was dating a boy, a boy of your age. He was very cute, good looking and funny. So this date, there was this school dance, you know, and she met another boy who happened to be the head boy of a neighboring school, you know? Now, this boy was, like, you know... what we'd call the confirmed bad boy. Right? Like, he smoked, he drank. But... he was devastatingly handsome. And that night, that evening, he gave all the attention to your mom, and your mom fell for it. And your mom left the boyfriend she had before and dated him. But the dating only lasted for just one week. She was heartbroken, and then she came back to her old boyfriend. But, as you can tell, he wouldn't have it. Now, maybe, just maybe, if he had listened to her, she would have made up for all the terrible mistakes she made. Mom did the same thing Debbie did. Yeah, you know, teenage boys make mistakes, teenage girls make mistakes. Are you making this up? Okay, okay, you know what, yeah? Let's have a deal. You talk to Debbie, hmm? And I promise to introduce you to Mom's ex-boyfriend, and then you can find out things yourself. - Huh. - Deal? Deal. Great, and here she comes, Margaret Thatcher. Just like her mom, hey. Why are you smiling like that? Oh, it's a boy's thing. You wouldn't understand, right? Whatever, can we go now? Well, of course. Yes, I know, I figured I could use a break from quality testing pressure vessels. Of course, I hope the food is not too unsettling. When in doubt, you go for meat. - Meat is meat, right? - Yes. No foie gras for me. Foie gras. Yeah, there you go. Is that the husband? Indeed. Why does he seem more... cultured than I expected? Well, I guess he had to be to hold your attention. Let me go through. Come here. He's wrong for you. Please, release me. You always say no. But I know you want it, hmm? In your dreams. Big mistake. Wow... Ow, ow, ow! - What is the meaning of this? - He grabbed my ass! - No, no, no, no. - He did what? It was a joke, you know, just between colleagues! That's the kind of joke that gets a man a good beating. Now, you... Big man, eh? You are the strong man, but you couldn't keep your wife out of my hotel room. - Huh? - Yes, tell him. Shut up. Shut up, my friend. Okay. No, no, no, honey, it's... The way you came dressed in that red bra you wore just for me. It's not what you think. Wait, please, please, look. - You slept with that maggot? - No. You slept with another man! I didn't. Really, I didn't. - Yet you were naked in his hotel room. - No, it's not what you think. I did not. Look, look, I was upset, you refused the Total job. Oh, it's my fault? You have an affair, yet it's my fault? - No, no. - Oh, gosh, that's so messed up. - Where are you going? - This shit is... Ebere, Ebere, Ebere... Ebere, wait, where are you going? - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - No! Let's talk about this, wait. Come on, what are you doing? Huh? - I'm leaving. - Wait, wait. - You're leaving? Why? - Yes. Because I can't stand to be in the same room with you. Babe, what about this? Come on, what about this? You'd better get used to it, because there's no way I'm ever going to understand you. Ebere, please, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - I should be the one leaving. - Yes. But I'm the one leaving. Where are my bloody slippers! But she didn't sleep with him. She was in his hotel room, in her bra! But I'm more interested in why she didn't actually go through with it, and you should be, too. - Are you taking sides with her? - It's not about taking sides. Go home and speak to your wife, and actually listen to what she says. I thought I could sleep here. No, go home. Are you kicking me out? See, do you love her? Yes. - God help me, yes. - Toyosi. What the hell? What's that for? One, you didn't tell me. Two, you chased your husband out of the house. And three... I felt like it. Look at what you did. You want to remove my face? I can't even feel my face again. Sorry, sorry, sorry... Hey! Ah! - Why did you hit me? - Because you told my husband to leave me. - Was I wrong to? - Yes, you were! Nonsense. Yeah, maybe you weren't wrong. Maybe I deserved it. Okay. Sister, see. Toyosi loves you. If he's gone, it won't be for long. Have you heard? What are you still doing awake? I'm surprised you came back. You should have stayed where you went. Why are you talking to me like this? Dad does everything he can to make you happy, despite your madness. And what? The first chance you get, you storm out. I don't blame him for sleeping around. I'd do the same thing to you. Ireti! Come back here, now. Sit. Your mother loves you. She wants the best for you. But all you ever do is disrespect her. I won't have it. I've raised you better than this, Ireti. - Why do you keep saying "your mother"? - 'Cause that's not Mom, it's Dad. What are you talking about? How long have you known? I had my suspicions at the restaurant, but when Dad told me a story about Mom and her ex-boyfriend in high school, I knew something was up, and when I told Dad... you... about Debbie, you said that there were other fish in the sea. - Oh, hey, Mom. - Hey... He figured it out. Some story about some ex-boyfriend. And the pad at the restaurant helps. What the heck is going on here? What the fuck is going on here? - Hey, woman, watch your tongue! - Mind your language! - Why are you in each other's bodies? - God did it. - What does that mean? - Exactly what he said. We woke up one morning like this. - This is so not okay. - Well, we're not fans of it, either. - You! - Ow. Okey, you knew and you didn't tell me. I thought you would have figured it out, too. Okay, all right, guys. Please, just go to your room. We'll talk about this in the morning, okay? Calm down. - Go, go. Go. - Go on. Go on. Can we talk? I don't care. I don't care about Kehinde. You didn't sleep with him, fine. You wanted to, but you changed your mind, fine. None of that matters. Everyone keeps saying to me I should stick it out because I love you. But what they don't realize is that there are two people in this relationship. Me loving you is not enough. Do you love me? Yes. Yes, I love you, Toyosi. I do. Do you want to stay married to me? I don't know. Now, that is where the problem is. Ireti, do you want to talk about it? Look, I know you're not Dad. There's no reason to pretend you care. You know the best thing about being in your father's body... is that you liked me. I'd even forgotten how that felt like. Do you know the best part about you being in Dad's body? The fact that I finally have a mother that cares enough to be my mother. I'd forgotten what that felt like. Why would you think that, Ireti? Huh? I love you. Do you know what your favorite argument to throw at Dad is? "I wish I'd never married you." Even if I never married your father... I would still have had you and your brother. And you and your brother are the best thing that ever happened to me. You have a funny way of showing it. - Look, Ireti... - I have to go wake my brother. Hey. I said, "Hey." Your husband came by mine last night. Do you want to talk about it? Okay, I'll talk. See, Toyosi really loves you. And I honestly think you guys can get through this, especially because you didn't sleep with the guy. I mean, why didn't you? It's 'cause you love him, right? I mean Toyosi, not the other guy, right? My daughter hates me. She thinks I didn't want to marry her father. Ah? - She thinks I didn't want to have her. - Don't be stupid! Who wants to be married and pregnant by the age of 21? Do you love your daughter? Of course you do! So explain to her the difference between regret and wishing she was never born. It seems to me you've forgotten what it is to be a teenage girl. So, why did you almost sleep with the guy? Before Toyosi started this place... he was working with Halliburton. He told me. He hated it. And then Total came along and made him an offer... that doubled his money. We were just coming out of five years of debt, so I wanted him to take the offer to ensure our security. And then he turned it down. He said he wanted to start farming. And you decided... - And you decided to leave him? - Would you blame me? We'd just got out of five years of hell, and he wanted to put the family at risk again. - He wanted to be happy. - At the expense of our family? - So, naked in a guy's bedroom? - Yeah. That one. Kehinde and I were on a work trip to Abuja. And that evening at dinner, I'd had a bit too much to drink. I can see where this is going. I thought we were done. I was done. I wanted to be done. I wanted to punish myself... for being done. And so I found myself the most despicable person, and decided to sleep with him. Why didn't you go ahead with it? Because I didn't want to not be married to him. It's not funny. You guys are so ridiculous. Like, you're so in love with each other, but you're too proud to admit it. For fuck's sake, please go and talk to your husband and listen to him. Ebere. - I'm sorry? - I am asking for your opinion. Of? The latest offer from Dynamic Partners is a 30-percent cut from their binding bid. Kehinde doesn't want us to take the offer. They're bluffing. What's their reason? They're worried about the markets and tax. We're worried about the markets and tax. So are you saying we should not take the offer? - Well, I... - No, she's not. No, I'm not. Then I guess we are not taking the offer, then. Ah, Mr. Akinyele, good to see you again. - Good to see you, too, sir. - I hope we'll see you really soon again. - Hopefully, sir. - Excuse me. - Thank you, sir. - Bye. Can we talk? We took a walk on the day I told you I was pregnant. Jumoke said we should be telling each other... the truth. You came to tell me how much of a failure I was? I deserve that. I didn't love you when we got married. I thought I was doing you a favor. I thought you needed to prove yourself worthy for all that I'd given you. So when the land deal went bad... and the court said we're owing your investors 50 million naira, I felt vindicated. But... sometime, then and when we had paid it off... I fell in love with you. However, the you I thought I fell in love with... was the oil and gas executive. So when you turned down the job offer from Total, I felt betrayed. I felt angry. Couldn't see myself loving a farmer. That's quite a story. But hey, I was wrong. I was very wrong. I can love a farmer. And I do. I was scared. Scared? Scared of what? - You. - Me? Or, rather, your success. I didn't think I could compete with you, so I decided not to try. To be honest, I probably resented you a little bit. Farming was a risk. But I decided to indulge, 'cause I knew our family would be safe because of you. I put my happiness first 'cause I knew you would be there to catch me if I fell. But you didn't fail. And it was right of you to try. I was so fixated on losing that I totally forgot that winning mattered. I'm not the only one who deserves the job they all love. Jumoke was right. We should tell each other the truth. So what happens now? We do better. We do better? Where are you? The ShopRite inspectors are here. Come now... now, now, now. Oh, my God. Oh, the inspectors are at the farm. - Damn it. - Yes. A surprise audit. - Okay, no worries, no worries. - Yes. I'll talk you through like... shit! - What's shit? What's shit? - I forgot both phones at home. What? Oh, no, no, no. Okay, that says it all. When you didn't pick up the phone, I thought you didn't want to talk, - but now I understand. - Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Okay, okay, okay, can you go get it? No, the meeting to finalize the RFP for the Triumph Summit LPO is in ten minutes. - Oh, no! - Ah! Can we skip it? I think we can put your company ahead of mine. For once. - See you later. - All right. - Thank God. - We have to stall. - No, wait, why? - Because Toyosi left his phone at home. Yes, and I can't fly solo. What if something goes wrong? - You better pray. - Huh, pray? Okay, we'll pray, we'll pray. Oh, yeah. Come on. I'm so sorry. Aren't you going to answer the call? No, um... it's the wife. Oh, I know. Sometimes it's good to run away from all their naggings. Indeed. Your feed plant is not up to standards. Yes, we are aware. We have plans to upgrade. No opinion? Remark? Words, any? Oh, good, great. Hello? Hey, baby. I'm sorry I couldn't talk. I was with the inspector. You did it without me? I couldn't wait, I couldn't. But we passed with flying colors. Yes! - We have to celebrate tonight. - Definitely, okay. Thank God you guys are cool again. I was worried for a second. What are you doing tonight? So if Emeka is there, who's watching the kids? - Good to know you haven't changed, hmm? - Mama is watching the kids. - Oh, thank you. - Oh. Disgusting! Isn't that, like, weird for you guys? - Not anymore. - Really? - So have you guys had sex? - God forbid! No, that's a bit weird for us. - Seriously? - Yes, it is. I would've thought knowing each other's body like it's your own would have its advantages. Please, please, please. Can we change this topic? We came here to drink, not to talk nonsense. - Once you dance to the rhythm... - Did you you start something? What would you like to drink? - Are you paying? - Sure. Champagne. Let us drink, before you are talking nonsense. - Wait! - What? - What is it? - Are you sure? I mean, the last time didn't... wasn't... Oh, please. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? Wait, um... What if... What if I get pregnant? No, I mean, what if you get pregnant? You know? - Wait, wait. - What? What's that? I knew this was here. What are we waiting for? Come here. - That was amazing. - Wow. Yes. - It was like you were inside my head. - I know. Oh, my God. - Jumoke was right, yeah? - Indeed. - Mm-hmm. - So do you think we should tell her? No. Oh. You too, huh? It doesn't matter, anyway. I guess we have to have more than sex to fully understand each other. Clearly. So you're off to wake the kids, huh? No, isn't that your job now that they know? No, you get to be the hard-ass. Oh, man, you're ruining my rep. What's going on? Dynamic Partners has announced the acquisition of Areleki Pharmaceutical. Well, the plan was for Dynamic to invest in Geltech and use it as a platform to acquire other companies. - This doesn't change that. - What do you mean? - Timi. - I want to know. We know that they want to do this deal. - Then why did they do Areleki? - Because we forced them to. And how did we force them? What do you want to say? Do it. - We gave you bad advice. - Are you out of your mind? - We overplayed our hand, and it backfired. - A word again and you'll be fired. - Do it. - Go back to them, take the deal. It's not the deal we wanted, but it will secure the future of you, your family, your company. Get out. - With all pleasure. - Now. Good riddance to bad rubbish. - Are you for real? - It's disgusting, like... - Oh, man, sorry. - Yeah, thank you. - But you need to take some drugs, though. - Yeah, I do, antibiotics... - Hey, honey! Hi. How are you? Hmm! - Why are you not upset? Well, because you did the right thing. Yes, because if it was probably me, I wouldn't have done it, and I would have been wrong. - But I lost you your job. - I know. That's why I avoided calling, I wanted you to have calmed down. I know, too. She blew her top already, right? Well, she did say, "What the hell am I going to do now?" But she sounded more puzzled than angry to be frank, so... Who are you, and what have you done with my wife? See, I've already tried to convince her to come and work for us. She didn't answer me. - But I'm not qualified. - What? You are. Of course you are. Deal wrangler, fund raiser. - Mm-hmm! - From just one conversation, you got us a better deal on the ShopRite contract, what are you saying? That's not such a bad idea. Plus, we'll be working closely together. - I know. - Which is now a good thing. Yes, it is. Hey, hey, hey! You guys should take your blue film out of here. Whoa! I still can't believe you didn't figure it out. The food tasted nothing like Dad's. No, that's because it's better. Thanks, Ireti, for taking my side. - May I be excused? - Wait. - Dad said... - Sorry. Ireti, look. I'm sorry I made you feel I regretted ever having you. Okay? I should have been more sensitive to your feelings. I just assumed that, you know, you knew that you and your brother are the joy of my life. She knows. She's afraid you're gonna leave us, so she's trying to leave you first. - Shut up. - What? Stop pretending you're not happy they're happy. Happy? They don't fight for two days, two days, and that makes them happy? - You're an idiot. - Ireti. Look, I understand. I totally do. I understand how you feel. You're afraid to think this time is different, I get it. But Ireti, come on, please. You have to give us another chance to prove that this time we've changed. Dad... is a better cook. Told you. Yeah, but what if you guys never change back? It doesn't matter. - What? What? - What your Dad is trying to say is that no matter what bodies we're in, we're still your parents, and we love you, nevertheless. Fine, as long as he doesn't buy me any more pads, uh-uh, no. - Deal. - Yeah. - Hello? - Am I speaking to Ebere? - Yeah, this is she. - Sorry? I said, this is... My God, Ebere! - Ebere, wake up. - What is it? What is it? Look, we're back! Ha! - Oh, yes, we're back. - Oh, my God, we're back! - Oh, my God! - What is going on? Ah! Come on... In the name of God, can't an adult have privacy in his home again? Isn't it weird kissing in each other's bodies? No, we're back! We're back! We're back. Oh, my God, I can't believe this. Tunde, Tunde, Tunde, she's on the phone. She's on the phone. Is everything okay? Everything is fine, it's just a little hectic at the moment. Do you have a moment to talk? Sure. Actually, no. I'm with my family. Can we speak later? Of course, but you call me first. Indeed. So, where were we? We're back! Okay, breathe now. Mom, I think you owe me an introduction to your ex-boyfriend. You spoke to Debbie? Oh, they're back together, and annoying everybody. Uh, what do you mean, "annoying everybody"? You're not doing something that we disapprove of, now, would you? - Young man. - I think that's Mom's line. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did, that is my line. That's my line, that's... But we're what? - Okay, sweetie. - Oh, God. - Okay, okay, okay, adult time. - Close your eyes! - Adults time. - Close your eyes. Out of my room! Get out! - Praise the Lord! - Hallelujah. - The Lord is good! - All the time. What a great day to celebrate that which the Lord has done. And your mother told me you got a new job. - Hallelujah! - Amen. And how are you feeling, now that you are back in your body? Pastor, how did you know? I'm a man of God! - And God is here! - Yes. - Amen, somebody? - Amen. Let us pray, let us pray. - Hallelujah. - Amen. Would you like me to pray for more children? No!
