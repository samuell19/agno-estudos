I mean it's so romantic. - A big, roaring fire? You're mad. In the summertime? You are nuts, absolutely nuts. - You wait. You wait. I'll show you. (upbeat music) - Absolutely nuts.

Run, run, get everybody. Help me, Matt. (soldier grunting) (mother screaming) No, put that down. Oh my God!

(mother screaming) I'm gonna take this stinking little- (mother screaming) I'm gonna take you and turn your britches down and I'm gonna whack ya good. I'm gonna take your teeth (grunts). You crazy kid. (light music) (soldier grunting) - Oh my God, Matt. What have you done? (Matt sobbing) (mother screaming) (heartbeat) (upbeat belly dancing music) (upbeat music continues) (music continues) (cymbals crashing) (upbeat music continues) (audience applauds) (car door slams) - Helen, I didn't see anybody last night. - Crap. - You never believe. - No, I've learned. - I, I, I did, I did see someone. - So now you're gonna tell me she's your sister? - We're just friends. - Ha, nobody's just friends with a belly dancer. - [Matt] If you listen to me. - [Helen] Yeah, what do you wanna tell me? That I'm the only girl in the world for you? I'll be making a big mistake by dumping you? - [Matt] You're making a mistake. - [Helen] Oh hell. - [Matt] You'd be making a big mistake. - Bull! I've been supporting you for months. Your clothes, cars, the food you eat. Hell, I even buy your shaving cream. - Look. I'm telling you. - You are telling me nothing. I've got the score now. - Yeah, you've had enough years to learn the score, haven't you, baby? - Yeah, and a lot better men than you to teach me. - Big, tough broad aren't you? - Yeah, tough and rich. And the rich part makes me different. Show is over, baby. - I've been wasting my time on a cheap, over the hill broad. (hand smacks) - Go on, go on back to her. To your belly dancer. Ha! A rotten tramp. (dramatic music) A tramp. A tramp! A tramp! - No! - You crazy kid. (dramatic music) (man grunting) - [Helen] A tramp! - Don't you say that. (both grunting) (dramatic music) - I'm not afraid of you. (panting) (dramatic music) No, no, Matt, no! (dramatic music) - Come here! (Helen screams) - Matty, no! Oh my. (dramatic music) (Helen grunting) (dramatic music) Oh my God! (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Oh, Helen. Oh, I tell you. Helen. Helen. Come on, baby. Hey, come on. Oh my. (melancholy music) (Matt sobs) (dramatic music) (engine roars) (water splashes) (water gurgles) (melancholy music) (birds chirping) (Matt breathing heavily) (Matt retching) - [Ann] Tina, this is the last time I'm calling you. Come down to breakfast. - [Tina] In a second, mom! - Gonna be late for school. - [Tina] You say that every morning. I haven't even missed the bus yet. - I mean it now, Tina, turn off the noise and get down here to breakfast. Good morning. It's about time, young lady. - Ew. Yuck. - What's the matter? - It's cold. - Of course it's cold, it's been ready for 10 minutes. Eat and take your vitamin. - Julia Marstow called. - When? - I don't know. A couple minutes ago. - I didn't hear the phone ring. And how could I with all that music going on? - She wants you to call her back. - I'll call her later, she wants to gossip. - Julia's bananas. - You're talking about my best friend. - Well she is. And that guy, Clarence. Clarence, that's a clown's name. - You're the clown. - Can I have some folding money? - What happened to your allowance? - I spent it. -All right, you know where my bag is. But take $2 only. No more. (traffic rumbles) (lighter clicks) (tires screech) (birds chirping) - You crazy? You wanna get killed? What are you doing? What the hell's the matter with you? - Well, you stopped, didn't you? -All right, come on. (engine revs) You gotta be crazy, standing in the middle of the road like that. - You gotta be crazy smoking. Don't you know, it can kill you? (Matt chuckles) - Why aren't you in school? - I cut. - You're not gonna learn anything that way. - Be careful! (tires screech) (dramatic music) You hit it! I told you to be careful! (birds chirping) Please let's go back. It might be okay. - No, no, it's okay. Dogs lick their wounds. They clean 'em real good. It'll be okay. All that blood. Somebody should have been watching that dog. - This is where I get off. - Hey, kid. (birds chirping) (mournful music) - You're the only one I can talk to, dad. The only one. - [Julia] You ready? - Good morning, Julia. - Hi. You got any coffee? - Mm-hmm, help yourself. What are you doing up so early? - Oh, well, you know a little old me, always on the go. Hey, hey, is this new? I love it. - You gave it to me for Christmas last year. - Oh yeah. Hey, say, oh, I know. There's something I wanted to ask you. I want you to come to dinner tonight. I met this divine man- - Oh, I can't. Can't, can't. - Can't, can't? Well, there's no such word as can't can't. - The shop stays open late tonight, remember? - Oh, yeah, well, why you bother with that shop I just don't know. One would think you weren't well off. - And then there's Tina. - Well you've spoiled her rotten. Ann, you've got to learn to live your own life. - I suppose you're right. You know, when Bill was alive, the three of us were so close. Tina misses him terribly. - Okay. Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make it tomorrow night. Then you won't have an excuse. Now you're gonna love this guy. He's a regular Burt Reynolds from the neck down. - And from the neck up? - Huh? Can't have everything. - Forget it. -Ann, Ann. You got to stop hiding from people. Now you're a beautiful girl, meet people. Life will pass you by and before you know it, you hit the big number 40. - 40? I thought you told me life begins at 40. - Sometimes, honey. Sometimes. Now wear something cute for that little old figure, okay? See you later. - Bye. (door creaks) You're right, Tina, she's bananas. (laughs) (light piano music) Okay, Agatha, let's get started. (zipper squeaks) (Ann grunts) Oh, thanks. - I arrived in the nick of time. - Agatha's is giving me some trouble. - Agatha? - Yeah, I named her after a teacher of mine. - I'd like a package of cigarettes. - Sure. She was a loo-loo. One way of getting even. - The little cigars in the red package. - Sure. - If Agatha gives you any trouble, you ask for me. - [Ann] Oh, thanks. (light music) (siren blaring) - Okay, fella, let's move it. Hey, I said let's move it! (phone buzzing) - Your buzzer's ringing. - You better believe it. (sultry music) (knocking) - It's not locked. (sultry music) - I hope I didn't keep you waiting. (sultry music) (zipper scrapes) - Let's see if it's been worth waiting for. - It has been worth waiting for. They came out real nice. Land Development Counseling Investments. That sounds like a right nice business, Mr. Stone. - A client of mine, just last month, tripled his investment. -All right. - Mm-hmm. Jamaica's a great place for that kind of thing. - It might be nice for a man like myself. - It takes a bit of capital. Here, keep one of them. - [Clarence] Thank you, kindly. - Clarence, I want you to cash me a check, dear. - I'm waiting on this gentleman. In a minute, Julia. - I haven't got a minute, dear. - I'll loan you one. - Don't be a smart ass. - That'll be $12 and 28 cents. Thank you. (register rattles) - Oh, dear. Miss Marstow. - Mrs. Marstow. I'm a widow. - Um (chuckles), there you go, sir. There we are. And five makes 20. - Oh, thank you. - You come back in now, ya hear? - I Will. Mrs. Marstow. - Who is he? - His name is Matthew Stone. - Oh, investments. Where'd he come from? Is he married? - Do I look like a fortune teller? - Give me $10, Clarence. I knew you weren't gonna write me a check. You never do. - Come on, come on. That makes 50 you owe. (Julia laughs) - And don't forget about dinner tonight. And don't be late, Clarence. - Just you don't start getting picky. Picky, picky, picky. - Allow me. - Oh, hello. We meet again. - Mrs. Marstow, I'd like to introduce myself. - I know who you are. Matt Stone. Listen, I was giving some thought to the idea of investing. - [Matt] We could make whenever you want, say tomorrow, next day, whenever. - [Julia] No, no, I've got a better idea. Come by for dinner tonight, say seven-ish. I'm having a few people over. Nothing fancy. I'm on Beach View Drive. Now you can't miss the house. Ah, remember Clarence it's gin, not water. - I wouldn't even know what water tasted like. Haven't touched the stuff since I was a baby. - Mm-hmm, I could tell by your coloring. Beet red with a jigger of purple. Ann, as I was saying, I met this divine man, so I substituted him for the other one. - Julia, honey, you're just a little old matchmaker. - Now she's picking him up off the streets for me. - That's exactly what she did. - Oh, don't be crude. - I wish you'd tell me what I'm doing here. - Oh, oh, you can't escape Julia. She'd find you no matter where you head and drag you by the heels if need be. (phone ringing) - Hello? (caller whispering) What? (caller whispering) - [Caller] My hands over your (whispers). - It's my first obscene phone call. Oh yes, well, could you wait a minute? - [Caller] Where you going? - No, I just wanna get a cigarette. - [Caller] Rub my thigh. - [Julia] Yes. (caller whispering indistinctly) - [Caller] Things of things. Things of things will get incredible. I can really, really suck it down. With tenderness. - Oh, but, yes, do call anytime. - [Caller] My stomach up and down your. (Julia laughs) - Can you believe that? (all laughing) - Yes. - Maybe you should have invited him to dinner. - (laughs) I think so. Oh, there he is now. Get ready. (crickets chirping) Hello, Matt. I'm so glad you found your way. My, you handsome men always know the right thing to do. Please come in. Ann, this is Matthew Stone. - [Ann] This is a lovely wine. What is it? - [Matt] Portuguese. - Mr. Stone, I've been having second thoughts. Now seems to me that the stock market is just a little bit shaky, and I think maybe I better hold on to my money. - What money, Clarence? Now, as you were saying, Mr. Stone. - Rule, number one, my name is Matt. Rule number two, Clarence, if I may call you that. Always buy when the others are selling. I've just had my broker acquire a large block of AT&T. - Is that a fact? - So you see, Clarence. - Dear, you just don't you start picking on me. Picky, picky, picky. (Matt laughs) - Oh, darling. Ooh, come with me. Would you excuse us, please? I've had the den done over. - Not again. - Always. I met this divine interior decorator, and he's done it all over in lavender blue. - Dilly, dilly. (Julia laughs) - [Matt] She's really something. - [Ann] You noticed. - Would you like another? - No, thank you. - Agatha behaving herself? - She's been a living doll. - Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping she'd give you more trouble. - Will you be staying here long? - Depends. - On what? - On Agatha. (both chuckle) - [Clarence] I have an idea. - [Julia] Oh really, and you've only had 12 martinis. - And one scotch. - Come on, you two, break it up. - I have to go home, it's late. - Oh, really? But it's really 12 o'clock. - Tina's home alone. It's nice meeting you, Matt. - I'll see you around. - I'll call you, Ann. Matt. - What a pleasure. - Thank you. So good to have you. - I'll come again. - I hope so. - Thank you for the dinner. - Surely. I'll talk to you, Ann. - [Matt] Let me get that. - Something tells me there's a romance cooking. And me, I'm stuck with handsome here. Salud. - Here, let me. - It was nice meeting you, Matt. - You said that. - For Julia's gift of gab. - We don't need gab. (birds chirping) (dog barks) (door slams) (engine revs) - [Tina] It's one o'clock in the morning. - Yes, I know. This is a switch, you waiting up for me. -All right, so what kind of clown did she have for you this time? - He was very nice. I going to see him on Sunday. - Sunday? - Mm-hmm. - We're supposed to go to the cemetery on Sunday. - Oh, I forgot. - I know. You forgot on the minute he died! - Tina. - Well, that's the truth. - Don't you ever talk to me way again. Do you understand? Now get to sleep! - [Matt] My mother died when I was born. My father raised me. He's wealthy. He's loaded. I had the English nanny, the private schools and the whole bit. My father retired. He gave up a seat on Wall Street and he wanted me to go with him, but I didn't wanna do that. I thought I could do better on my own. - How are you doing? - Oh, pretty well. You know, it's a, it's a challenging business. Win a few to lose a few. But I think I'll do okay here. I think I've come to the right place. Watch where you're going. Hey, watch it. What do you think you do, you own this place? You fat. People like you ought to be ground up and made into dog food. Hey, you know what's in these things. - What's that all about? - There's pigs feet, pig snouts. - Stop. - There's sawdust. There's blood. - Will you stop? - Look, see the? Just goes to show you, you can't judge a hot dog by its skin. - No, you certainly can't. - Here, hold my hot dog. - Here, you hold mine. - You hold my, I'll hold you. No, if you, if I hold you, will you let me- - Both of them. - How come you never remarried? - I don't know. I guess I never found the right guy. Why haven't you? - Oh, I don't know, I guess I never found the right girl. - What are you looking at? - Ooh, I'm looking at the most beautiful, roundest cheeks I ever saw. The cheeks. Hey, I have the most wonderful view of this city from my motel room. I don't suppose- - No. - That you wouldn't- - No. - You're sure? - Come on, you haven't seen anything. - I bet I haven't. - This way. (dramatic music) (clock chimes) - Hi, pumpkin. I'm sorry I'm late. - [Tina] I've been waiting for hours. - Oh, I should have phoned. Hey, what have you been doing, having a party? Those are my good dishes. They're antique. - You said you'd be back in time for us to go to a movie. - I know. I should have called. I'll make it up to you, okay? Next week you and I will go to a movie and dinner all by ourselves, just the two of us. We just started talking- - Talking? - Yes, talking. Come on, Tina. Let me help you with your homework. Come on. You couldn't have finished all that already. Let's see. No, you sure haven't. 1,2,3. I don't know if I know that much about this new math, but I'll try. (dish clatters) - It slipped. Oh, and it's your beautiful China. (bright music) - [Julia] Walking is good for you. You should do this every day on your lunch hour. - Now you didn't drag me all the way out here for the exercise. You've got something you wanna say. - What makes you think that? How are things going between you and Matt? - Ah, so that's it. To tell you the truth nothing's happened. - Still worried about Tina? - Can't help the way I feel. - Look, honey, you finally met someone. - Uh-huh. - Well, you can't deny it. - Julia, I don't wanna talk about it. - Well, it's just that I wanna see you happy. I like Matt Stone. He's honest, direct. He likes you. Do you like him? Then go get him. - Julia, thanks for being concerned. (waves crashing) (contemplative orchestral music) - [Tina] Nobody could replace dad. Right, mom? - [Ann] Right. - [Julia] Look, honey, you finally met someone. - [Ann] Have I? (contemplative orchestral music) - [Tina] We're doing alright. - [Ann] I've got my own life to lead. - [Tina] We're doing alright. - [Ann] My own life. My own life. (contemplative orchestral music) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (dogs barking) (Ann breathing heavily) (crickets chirping) - Nobody ever could replace you, dad. Never! Never! I hate her, I hate her! (sobs) - Tina! Tina! Tina. Oh, there you are. What are you doing in the dark? The front door was unlocked. What's the matter? Have you got locked jaw or something? - What do you want, Julia? - I came to see your mama. - Well, why don't you check the motels? - Tina, that's a terrible thing to say. - She's becoming just like you! Get outta here, Julia! - What in the world's wrong with you, Tina? (dishes clatter) (somber music) - [Ann] Tina, darling, are you home? - Tina, what happened? - I, I bumped into it in the dark. - You'll cut yourself, let me help you. (somber music) I want you to meet someone. Tina, this is, this is Matthew Stone. (dramatic music) Tina. Tina. (patrons chattering) (light music) Tina's never acted this badly before. I don't understand it. - Do kids that age tell you everything? It's growing pains. - Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. - Will you stop blaming yourself? Kids are kids. It's no use trying to keep up with them. - I suppose you're right. Perhaps I'm too concerned. - Hey, that's beautiful. - Thank you, my husband gave it to me. Julia told me you two had a business meeting this morning. - Yeah, everybody's interested in doubling their money. - Including me. Is it possible? - I'm oversubscribed as it. - That's too bad. - But I've got something good in the works. - If that's the case, I can come up with 10,000. - That's a nice amount. That's a real nice amount. In that case, I think I can come up with something. - Alright. What's the matter, Matt? Matt? - Nothing. The time, I've gotta meet someone. Business. You're passing through town, Pete? - That's depending on you. - On me? - Yeah. - Oh, you think I'm into some action. - Yeah. - I don't know, Pete, there's no action here. If I had known you were coming I'd've brought a jug. (laughs) Hey, Pete, leave it to you. I'll get some glasses. - Hey, that was some nice-looking chick I saw you with. I said, that was some nice-looking chick. Another headache? Have you been going to a doctor? - They never listened to me. - Yeah, I know. Yeah. - It killed my mother when they put me in that place. - Yeah, yeah. - They took care of me there though. I was okay. I begged them not to let me out. I said it was like putting a puppy dog out in the middle of the road and leaving it there. (suspenseful music) She turned on me. I didn't mean to do it. - Do what? - She took the scarf and I took the twisted it, tighter and tighter. I heard her neck snap. (suspenseful music) But you gotta understand, I didn't mean to do it. - But you did it. You took my advice, but you told me there were no action. - Nothing's going right. - Nothing is easy. Especially robbing people, but we'll do okay. Yeah. - We? - Yeah, we. - Mm-mm, no, Pete, this is mine. I work alone. - Look, you punk, after seven years in stir, I'm back in the ring. I'm 50, you hear? My bones, can't take it no more. I need cash, now. You hear? Now! Business meeting always makes me tense. Pour us a drink, Matt. - Pour it yourself. (fist thuds) - That could have been your head. Pour. (glasses clinking) - Hey, Pete, there's this place, it's loaded. A widow, the old bitch has got it stashed someplace. - Good. You'll take it from her tonight. I'll stick around 'til about 10 o'clock, then we go. - You know that desk clerk, that good looking piece? I got a regular thing going with her. She'll be here any minute, so. - You all the time horny. (Matt laughs) Okay, now there's this car wash place called El Dorado. Can't miss it down the road. - Oh yeah, I know it. - Meet me there at 10 o'clock. Oh, don't blow town, Matt. I can find you, no matter where you go. And don't pull anything. - Pete, I'm glad you're back. It's been bad without you. Goodbye. (glasses clink) - Domo origato. You and me, remain the main event. Top of the bill. Top of the bill. - Oh, mom. Oh, damn. Damn. Damn, damn. (crickets chirping) (RV rumbling) (door slams) (dogs barking) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) Hey (laughs), hang in there, Pete. Come on, baby, hang in there. Hey. (dramatic music) Come on. Come on. (dramatic music) No, no, no, no, Pete. No, no, Pete. No, Pete, you can't do that. (dramatic music) No. (dramatic music) (Pete thuds) (upbeat dramatic music) (tires screech) (upbeat dramatic music) (car wash hums) (dramatic music) (water roaring) (tires screech) (dramatic music) (tires screech) (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (door slams) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) Tina! (dramatic music) Tina, come back here! (dramatic music) Tina. Tina! Tina, if you tell anyone, I'll kill you. You hear me? I'll kill you. (Tina breathing heavily) (phone ringing) - [Operator] Operator. - Yes, may you connect me to the police department? - [Operator] Emergency? Just a minute please. (phone ringing) - [Officer] Police department, Sergeant Thompson here. Please answer. (Tina sobbing) Who's calling? Hello? Hello? Can we help? Hello? Hello? - [Ann] I don't know what's the matter with Tina. - [Matt] Maybe she's sick. - She doesn't have a fever. - [Ann] Don't worry about it. - [Ann] But she hasn't spoken to me all morning. It's not like her. She seems afraid of something. - [Matt] Oh yeah? - [Ann] I was going to ask her to come with us, but maybe I better not. - [Matt] No, ask her. Be nice for her to enjoy herself. - Maybe you're right. Tina, Tina, come here, darling. (birds chirping) Why don't you go on another ride? I sent Matt to get us some candy. - Mom. - Isn't this fun, darling? You know, it could be this way all the time. - Mom. - What's the matter? You seem so upset. (dramatic music) That's a terrible thing to say. - It's the truth, mom. Don't you understand? - You've told me enough lies. - But don't you understand the broken window. - It's not going to do any good. - The man hit it! - You go to the car right this minute. (dramatic music) - What was that all about? - Oh, nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? You're shaking. - Matt. - [Child] Daddy. - Please. - I'm cold back here. Will you roll up the window? (dramatic music) - [Matt] It's not cold. (suspenseful music) - [Ann] She said it was cold. Could you roll up the window? (suspenseful music) (paper rustles) - [Matt's Mother] Matt, sweetheart, it won't be for long. You need rest and care, darling. Care I can't give you. (suspenseful music) - [Young Matt] I tried to help you mom. He was hurting you. - [Matt's Mother] I know, Matt, I know. - [Young Matt] Don't let them put me in there, mom. Please, I don't wanna go. (melancholy music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - [Tina] Matt killed that man. I was there in the car, I saw him do it. - Ow! Dammit! Why is Tina making up such an incredible story? Did you have your breakfast yet? Your girlfriend Elise called. I told her you'd call her back. Tina. Tina will you listen to me? I had no reason to get that upset with you yesterday. You have a right to be angry with me, but you've got to stop making up these stories. - I didn't make it up. I saw him do it. - You were wrong about the window. - He was smart. Real smart. He had it fixed. - I know why you're saying this. - [Tina] Why? - Because you resent Matt. I understand it, sweetheart. I know how much you loved your father. - [Tina] Said he was going to kill me. - Tina, it's not going to work this time. - He's going to kill me! - You're not gonna make me stop seeing him. - You must think I'm dumb! - Now what does that mean? - I saw you at the motel with him. Do you know what they call women like you? (hand smacks) - What's the matter with you? Tina! (Tina sobbing) Tina! (children chattering) (birds chirping) - Hey, wanna ride? Hey, little girl, I'll take you to school. You mad at me? I'm not mad at you. I like you. - You're scared. - Look, Tina, he deserved to die. He was bad. He'd snap your neck just like that. I did us all a favor. He was a waste of nothing. Come on, get in. - Maybe my mother won't believe me, but I'll tell- - You told- You told your mother and she didn't believe you? - Somebody will, somebody will. - You don't tell nobody. - I Will! - They'll say you're crazy. - I'm not crazy. You are. - Oh yeah? You gotta be crazy talking to a gravestone. - I'm not afraid of you anymore. (horn honks) Let him get away with it. I won't. (somber music) Somebody's gotta believe me. Somebody's gotta believe me. (Tina sobs) - But as you can see, it's quite a collection. You see, Matt, I was married three times, and all my husbands were collectors. Now, John, oh, he was my last husband, he owned castle in England, and that's how I got left with all this stuff. - That's beautiful. - Yes, would you believe that somewhere, somewhere around here, I have an authentic 14th century chastity belt. - Which you've never had to use. (Julia laughs) - Well, it's always nice to have a man around the house, especially one that can't cheat. No business now. Let's have a drink first, and then we'll get to the dull work. I want to hear all about you and Ann. How are things going? Okay? - No. - Oh, Tina? - Julia, I think that girl is crazy. - Well that's, that's kind of strong, isn't it? - No, no, I really mean it. I think she's capable of anything. She lies, she cheats. She sees things. It's weird what she does, Julia, really weird. That thing in the graveyard. She spends all the time going to graves. - Oh that, well, she visits her father. - But it's not normal. It just isn't normal behavior. Kid don't go to graveyards. My mother died and I went to visit her once. And, you can't bring back the dead no matter how much you cry. - Well, I admit she's strange, but, Matt, she's part of the package. - Yes she is, isn't she? - Well, you like Ann, don't you? Well then go after her. Don't let anyone stand your way. Forget about Tina. She'll adjust. Matt, you know, this is a very nice place to live. I could throw a lot of business your way. Ann needs you. - There's time. - As the man said, it waits for no one. Now about these investments, of course you understand my money is all tied up. - So untie it. - Well, that's easier said than done. We're talking about a big investment. - It'll pay out, Julia, I promise. - Well, well, I'll see my lawyer and have him look into it. - Your lawyer? - Oh yes, I never make a move without him. He'll check out your company. Oh dear, my broach. - Terribly sorry. Here it is. - Oh, thank you very much. Oh dear, there's a diamond that fell out. Would you see if you can find it, Matt? - Here it is. - Oh, there it is. Oh, thank you very much. I'll have to have that fixed. I'll put it in the safe later. Thank you. Let's have lunch now. Roger has prepared a marvelous paella for you. I'll see my lawyer and have him look into it. He'll check your company. (suspenseful music) I'll put it in the safe later. - I think you'll like this. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - You too. - [Ann] Hi. - Hey. Getting rich? - Are you kidding? I've had two customers all day. Any more questions? - Yeah, one. Would you be angry with me if I broke our date for tonight? - Furious, why? - I gotta catch a plane for Jamaica. - Well, how long will you be gone? - Couple of days. You still interested in investing? - Sure. - Well, if you, if you gimme the cash, I'll get it working for you right away. - I don't keep that kind of money in my checking account. - You still have time to make it withdrawal. Come on, get going. I'll mind the store. - Oh, all right. - Move, move, move, move, move, move. (Ann yelps) - Look, smile at all the customers. Be a nice sales lady. - I'll double the prices. - Don't you dare. - Hi, let me have- - We're closed. - Julia! (birds chirping) Julia! Woo. Hi. - Hi, Tina. - You want some help? - No, thanks, I can manage. You know it's convenient having your cemetery close to the house. I have three husbands to put flowers on. You know, they cost me a fortune? Say, what are you doing outta school? - I cut. - Oh. You know, I can never find that grave. They all look alike to me. The next husband that dies to me, I'm going to cremate. You know, if your mother knew you weren't in school. - Julia, I, I, wanna make up for the other night. I wanna be friends again. - Huh? We were never friends. You like me as much as you like a rattler. - And, Julia, I do have something to tell you. - What? - Julia, I, I saw this murder last night. - Oh yeah? Is the body buried here? - No, he was killed in the car wash. - Well, that's as good a place as any. - He ran this guy down. - Now who ran who down? - Matt did. - Matt had an accident? - He killed him! He killed him! - Now what the hell are you talking about, a car wash- - I was in the backseat of the car. -All right, Tina, all right. Now, why haven't you said something about that before now? - Well, I was afraid at first. Then later on, I told my mom. - And naturally she didn't believe you. - No. - Well, what makes you think I'm gonna swallow that story? - Matt Stone did it. - Well of all the contemptible. - He did it. He did it. - Oh, Tina, Tina, you'll make up anything just to keep them apart. Anything. - Look, I met him before any of you. He gave me a ride. He ran down this dog without even stopping. - Now, Tina, you've got to stop these stories and these lies. - But it's the truth. - You've got to stop this insane lying. Your mean, jealous, vicious little girl and you've got to stop it. (birds chirping) - If you don't double this, you're in a lot of trouble. $10,000, the last of the mad money. - When I get back, I've got something very important I want to talk to you about. - Tell me all about your wife you got hidden in the closet? - He's my uncle, you see? And I'd sort of like to surprise him. So if you could just let me have the key to his room. - Matthew Stone? Oh, hun, he checked out over an hour ago. - What? - Sure. Checked him out myself. Said he was catching a plane. - Plane. Are you sure it was Matt? Matthew Stone? - Excuse me, sweetie. Motel 11, just one moment please. - Yeah, I know who Matthew Stone is alright. - And you don't know where he's going, do you? - No, just that he had to catch a plane. Motel 11. - Thank you. - Would you hold please? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Julia] Hello, Ann, this is Julia. - Hi, what's up? - [Julia] Ann, I've got to talk to you. Can you come over to my place tonight? - Sure, after I close. Is anything wrong? - No, it's just that I'm concerned about something. Call it woman's intuition. (phone receiver hangs up) (suspenseful music) Alright, everybody. There you go, Tess. Bobby? Oh, don't be greedy. There's plenty for everybody. (dramatic music) Matt? I thought I looked the door. Well what are you doing here? (suspenseful music) Tina's made an accusation. - Tina? (suspenseful music) - A serious one about you. (suspenseful music) Was it you, Matt? (dramatic music) Please don't do that! - I tried to hang him. Then I had to run him down. I tried to run him down. - Oh my God. Tina wasn't lying. - Oh, she was, she was- - She wasn't lying, was she? - Oh, no, she tried to tell him. - Let me go. Let me go! - I'm gonna have my lawyer look into it. - Let me go. Let me go. What do you want? Tell me what you want. - The safe, the safe, where is safe? - The safe? - Where is it? Where's the safe? The safe! Where the hell is the safe? - The safe? - Yes, the safe. - Help! There's a safe in, the safe. - Open it! (suspenseful music) (Julia screaming) (dramatic music) - Matt! (dramatic music) (Matt yells) (dramatic music) (Julia grunting) (dramatic music) Oh my God! No. No! Oh my God, no, please. Please, oh God! (dramatic music) (Julia screams) (Matt grunting) (Matt whimpering) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (frogs croaking) (dramatic music) (Tina screams) (Matt huffing) - Tina. (Tina breathing heavily) (Tina screams) (dramatic organ music) (Matt grunts) (dramatic organ music) (papers rustling) (Matt sobs) (suspenseful music) - Julia? Julia, are you home? (suspenseful music) Matt. Oh my god. (suspenseful music) Oh my God, Matt! (Ann screaming) (dramatic music) (Ann screaming) (dramatic music) (Matt gasps) (Tina whimpers) (Matt groans) (Tina screams) (melancholy music) (Tina crying) - [Matt] It was like putting a puppy dog out the middle of the road and leaving it there. (melancholy music) (melancholy music continues)
