What's wrong? Why do you look terrified? I don't know whether it's a restaurant, a supermarket, or a launderette. When I entered, I started shivering. This is a restaurant, and I am the owner. Please come inside. No, please. I wasn't comfortable there. I started shivering, not sure why. This shivering is normal. Even I do that. We play music or instruments so customers enjoy eating. I smelled Summag. I thought it was "Musatkan." Musakhan rolls. But now I've lost my appetite. "Musakhan," "Mathbi," or "Mandi," they're all the same as long as you feel full. Come inside, come! No, please! By the way, are you a doctor or a pilot? I was a pilot. I had an accident and now I have a phobia. So now I'm a captain. A captain of what? Yacht captain. Aha! Great. But what is a yacht? A ship on the sea. So, if I came with you, you'd drown me or what? Come on, man. We are there to help. Look, you have all the details. - Please come in. - I need to leave. - No, sorry, I can't. - It's fine, dear, the shaking is normal. I don't believe I will contact you. However, I will keep it for the future. Ali, as I promised you, the map of the farm is ready. Let me tell you, guys, as you can see, this is the farm's road. And, as you know, it's far away. But this is to our benefit. Okay, bro, this is to our benefit. But what about our goods in the photos? Where would we store them there? Can't you see there are only stables? What's next? Elaborate. A good point. I will tell you. In that stable, we will build a secret warehouse underground where we can store all our goods. This way nobody will suspect a thing. And nobody will think of us. Ali, what do you think? Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. But Ahmed should complete the mission as soon as possible. Ahmed… Call him right away and ask him when he will accomplish the mission. 'Cause it's taking too long. Okay. - The jerk won't answer. - He should! Keep on calling until he answers! Oh, God! Oh my God! Oh, Awadh, I'm not sure if I was cursed. I don't know what's happened to me. I am so unhappy. For instance, look at that customer. Looks like he's eating, but suddenly, he'll become scared and leave. All customers are like that. Just watch. God help you, my friend. You are in a bad situation. Have a nice meal, sir. The best chicken Mandi! Oh yeah! In the name of God. What the hell?! Where are you going? - You haven't finished your meal! - I forgot I had lunch at home. Aha, and who will pay for this meal? I haven't even touched the food. The chair fell over. I think there's a demon… A demon? Do you know where they are? The demon is you. And why do you look crazy? Why do you insult me? I am a customer with rights! - Oh, you look good. - Get your hands off me! Naji, this is inappropriate. He's a customer. He's yelling at me! This is wrong. What are you doing? That was the dagger, sorry. Both of you are crazy! And your restaurant has demons. - You're demons! - You are crazy! Yeah, sure. Laugh. Demons' restaurant! What are you laughing at? Listen. You told me someone wants to buy the restaurant? Right. Why don't you buy the restaurant? You have the skills required to run it. And I am sure you will be successful. You buy it and take it! It's true I do have the necessary skills. But I don't have the skills to deal with demons! Listen, I have a solution for you. Why don't you sell your restaurant as scrap? Separately. Like the chairs, spoons, and so on. And you will get a return on your investment. We'll see who's laughing in the end. Listen. With all the restaurant issues, I will pay you… 10,000 riyals. I will take over all the problems. He looks right and left, like he's got lots of money and is afraid of looters. You think I'll sell it for 10,000? If you'd like to buy this restaurant, then offer me 100,000. What 100,000 are you talking about? I swear I like you. The friendship feelings I have for you are deeply engraved in my heart. - No worries. - Yeah. I will give you an additional 2,000. I will pay you 12,000. What do you say? Spend that extra 2,000 on your family. Leave, leave! What's wrong with you? Don't bother my customers. Get lost! Welcome, my new customer. Welcome. You look so positive. I am talking to you. Look at me. Don't act tall and dumb. What do you like to eat? "Mandi," "Mathby," or "Araas"? - Anything, just say it. - No, no! They told me you have a demon. And I want to see it. You want to see the demon. He's dumb. - Listen, you want to see the demon? - Yes. We have many types. Come. I'll show you. No worries. I didn't want to take you there, but you asked to see the demon. Come, stand here. Everything is fine. You know, life is rough sometimes. Get lost! And don't show your face again. I don't have time for more trouble. God damn such customers! Your grandfather is annoying. I have a solution for all of his issues. - How? - We'll get him married. Let him get me married first. Yes, you are right. You've become old. - Listen. - Yes? If I wanted to leave this country, where should I go to? Where would you go, Muthanna? You'd barely reach the valley. You, Amer! Amer! - This is your crazy grandfather. - Amer! Yes, grandfather! Muthanna, you come too. Quickly! Quickly! - Yes. - Sit beside me. Sit! What's happened? Naji! What's wrong with him? Is he ill? I wish he were ill. Has he died? I wish he had died. What is the problem? Am Naji Restaurant has demons! Oh, God. Let him sell it off. Look how stupid he is! Who buys a restaurant with demons? Why should we care about Naji? You are such an awkward jerk. Don't insult me. You deserve it, cousin. You are my cousin, so don't insult me. Stop it! I'm telling you that Naji has a problem. His restaurant is filled with demons. And you're fighting! I've decided to travel to the Emirates. The Emirates? Grandpa, if you go to the market, you get lost. Stop your nonsense. I said I will travel, and that's it! That's it, I will travel with you. I'll buy the tickets and stay with some friends of mine. I will talk to Naji to prepare the visa. - I'll go and get the tickets. - Okay, great. - I want to come with you! - You get lost. One, two, three, and four. Five, six, seven, and eight. Come here. What have you done to your hair? This is a modern style, Dad. Also, who works out at night?! "One, two, three"? You'll strain yourself. Then you'll call Mother. "Um Mohammed, I am hungry!" Take it easy. - Where are you going? - To the supermarket. Do you need anything? I'll bring you some bananas. Good for workouts and stuff. I'll bring you five, not one. - Do you think I am a monkey? - No, Dad. No. If you're a man, try to pass by me. - If I'm a man? - Yes, to go outside. Saleema! Saleema? I am your mother, jerk. After God, you should respect your mother. You're really unrespectable! Move away and let my son pass, otherwise I won't cook dinner! No dinner, no dinner Thank you, Mother, love you! No dinner, no dinner Oh, God. You know how valuable this is to me. It's from my grandfather. But nothing is more valuable than you, Naji. Nothing but you, Naji. Great, you didn't hit anyone on the way. Anyone want to bet? No. - I believe I interrupted you. - Yes, that's true. So… how did you learn those moves? Listen. I watched some YouTube videos this morning and learned how to ride like that. Those who are gifted can learn anything. Right. Don't you know that cigarettes aren't good for children? I mean, not good for your health. Diablo… I like your calmness. Unfortunately, you don't have anything to offer. Come here. Come. Let's take a driving challenge. Following my rules. The loser leaves his bike here and walks away. Listen to what he's saying! Don't you know me? I am Omer Al Fazaa. Think! Al Fazaa who? Prove yourself. Listen, guys, he said, "Prove yourself." Today you'll see him walking back. Let's start the race, guys! Let's do it! Let's go! Guys, they're here! Yeah! Great job, well done! Where is the Fazaa! Now you can go for a walk. Yeah, keep laughing. Next time, I will laugh at all of you, one by one. And you, next time, we'll have another race. Yeah, right. See you later then! Let's go, guys. Ahmed, you told me we'd go to Magdaz. This is the second time you've brought me here. I love her. I adore her. I love her so much. - Does she have a sister? - No. Then why did you bring me here? By the way, she doesn't love you. She has a crush on me, but her irritating father has refused me four times. Take it easy. I have a great plan. I've painted my hair like Justin Bieber. When I go in there, they'll think I am your foreign educated friend. What Justin Bieber, my dear? You know who you look like? Like this. What do you know about fashion? Ahmed, wait! Ahmed, wait! Ahmed, wait! He's so stupid. I swear he is. Hello. Listen, he's screwed us. He's entered her house. Come quickly! Ahmed! My heart! What's wrong with it? My heart is hurting me. I swear I'll give you mine. I have two hearts. Just a second. I have two, right! Here is one. Catch it! Mister! Mister, wait! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. My name is Bium Basalum. I came directly from Zanzibar. I came specifically to you because I know there is… I have a company called… Oceo. It's a furniture company to fix and arrange your house. No, thanks. I don't need that. My friend, wait a moment. Ahmed! God help me! How did she say my name? A marriage. Tea with saffron, tea with zaatar Tea with mint, tea with ginger, karak tea I will be karak for you You cannot find this offer anywhere. My friend… 50% discount! 70% discount! - Just listen to me! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - How are you, Abu Mohammed? Who's Mohammed? Mohammed or Ahmed is the same. Um Mohammed made you lunch, and her cook has run out of gas. Shall I replace the cylinder? Thank you. Close the door. Mister, this offer, you won't find it anywhere. Not in any of the Arab countries. Or anywhere in the world! You're giving me a headache! I do not need your furniture. "Mia ha ho"? Damn you. You don't have any morals. When will you be a man! Go in front of me. Brother, it's really worth it. You see, my home is far away. I came from there. And I came on foot. Focus. I'm talking to you! I am in a bad situation. You have to pay me some respect. Listen, brother, listen to me. I don't have anything to eat. Do you have any food? My brother… My brother, my brother, my brother. What the hell are you wearing? Your house is not nice. Your slippers are funny. You think I'm stupid? What a conman! Stop making trouble. It means, why you are doing this to us? Why? What's wrong with you? Get rid of this character. The man has left. Ahmed, when will you stop making trouble? Entering houses is not right. Naji, I have a crush on her. What should I do? You love her. Ask her father for her hand. Her father rejected me four times. Not an excuse. Don't go inside again. Naji, be honest with me. - What do you think about the girl? - What do I think of her? She is beautiful, really beautiful. Oh, yeah, I'm in heaven In her hand is Henna I hold her hand And my heart has sung Oh, yeah, I'm in heaven In her hand is Henna I hold her hand And my heart has sung The source of my madness Enchants my eyes I swear she won't live A moment without me The source of my madness Enchants my eyes I swear she won't live A moment without me What is this "raga ra?" Why did your father reject me? Every time, every time Waiting at your doorstep To meet you outside Why did your father reject me? Every time, every time Waiting at your doorstep To meet you outside Dani Dani, Dan Dana Don't leave, my darling I will die of love This girl is mine I don't want to hear anymore, demon boy. You're sweet as cake And all the rest is fake I can't stand this beauty My heart is crazy about you Your glimpse is fire Like hot, like spicy My taste is so special And I don't want anyone other than you Take all my money I don't care about anything As long as you're my love Nothing else matters Take all my money I don't care about anything As long as you're my love Nothing else matters Wait, wait. Cake, spicy, and take all my money? And can't stand all this beauty? What the hell are you talking about? Get out, all of you! Grandpa! What do you want to do in the Emirates? You know how much trouble I have? My restaurant has demons. What? If I don't help you with this problem, when should I help you? I don't want you to worry. I'll bring an artifact with me. It belongs to my grandfather. It's even more valuable than you. You are an artifact. No need to bring one with you. My dear, you don't know your grandpa. I want to ask you, where did you get this piece from? I'm afraid you've stolen it! Is this how you return my favor? You know how straight I am. And I don't like fooling around. The artifact piece has been inherited from my great-grandfather. Blah, blah, blah. I don't care what you're saying. Are you coming alone or with someone? I'm coming by myself. I am not a baby! But maybe I'll bring Amer with me. I'm not sure. Anyway, when I arrive, I want a great living room to stay in. And there should be some shampoo. I don't want it to burn my eyes. I hate shampoo that burns my eyes. No worries, I will get the shampoo. As well as citric acid if you want me to. Anyway, send me your papers so I can get your visa. - Then I will check your shampoo - Okay. I'll ask Amer to send them to you. Via Google Internet WhatsApp Yahoo. - Forget about it. I'll talk to Amer. - Good. - Bye. - Bye. Sorry to make you wait for the food. I am wasting my money on useless stuff. To be honest, I already bought the Nissan. I don't like the four-wheel drive anymore. This time, I'll look for a sports car. It would be so much fun to drive one… Get him! Get him! This time, this is enough to wake you up. But next time, I will release your soul. Oh, yeah, coach. Well done, Amoor. All the credit belongs to you. No, it's your hard work and practice. When shall we have another session? Hopefully, next time is the last session. Then you'll get into the race. See you next week then. - God's will. Bye. - Bye. Hello. Hi, Kindi. Hi, Amoor. I'm inviting friends to the farm today. Naji and Ahmed will be coming. Are you in? Sure, I will be there to see the guys. Aha, so you're not coming for the food? No, for sure, I want to see you today. You're always saying that. Anyway, we will be waiting for you. Sure thing. Okay. Take care. Uncle Naji! Yes, Hani, what do you need? Are you leaving me with your demons? Take me with you. Otherwise, you'll find only my mustache here in the morning. Hani, you stay here alone every day. Only today, I know your intention! You know we're having a gathering today. Your tummy wants to join us. My tummy just grew today. No worries, you can join us. - Thanks. - Lock the restaurant first. Are you afraid of losing a demon? What have you done to your hair? Look, I'll get straight to the point. My father is Lebanese. And my mom is Syrian. Like that then. God wants that. Anyway, guys, today I've brought healthy food. As long as all of us are athletes. - I mean, some of us. - I'll never eat healthy food. I'll eat Hani but not healthy food. Trust me, Kindi. Try this food for a week. You will see a difference. I like my look when I'm fat. But I forgive you this time. Okay, shall we eat? "Shall we eat"? We're going for dinner, not declaring war. We're waiting for Ahmed to arrive first. - By the way, what's the restaurant's name? - It's Wawan Muscle. Looks professional. Unlike Naji's demon restaurant. Why did you bring Hani? Don't you have friends? Listen, do not mess with me. I will mess with you. My whole life is trouble. Take it easy, Hani. I know him very well. Besides, why do you remind me of my restaurant? When I see you, I lose my appetite. God damn you, my restaurant, and Hani as well. - Thank you so much. - You're most welcome. I wanted to ask you, Naji. Have you found a buyer for your restaurant? Don't remind me. Who would buy a restaurant with demons? I know a clerk. Shall I call him for help? - How are you, Amer? - Good, thanks. I like Amer. Let's gift him a Lexus. Sure. Your name, age, and phone number. I want the interior to be red. And the body a lighter color. As you wish. Sports, right? Provide legit details. So you won't lose the car. - I will WhatsApp you then. - Okay, good. We are starving! Where is Ahmed? - Peace be upon you, guys. - Peace be upon you. I'm sorry, Kindi, I know you're hungry. - I told them we won't eat without Ahmed. - You are my man. What's wrong with your face? Who labajed you? No one labajed me. Besides, what does "labaj" mean? "Labaj" means "beat you up." Who labajed you? You are labajed. - Tell us so we can kick his butt. - Who could beat me? No one can beat a professional fighter. You have a black belt? A couple of days ago he had a pink one! Guys, let's change the subject. Hani, let's swap places. - Hi. Ahmed. - Yes, Naji. Listen. Listen to me. I have an important matter. Yesterday my grandfather called with regard to my restaurant. He says he has an artifact, which he wants to sell. He believes it's worth millions. He asked me how to sell it. Naji, foreigners are always interested in artifacts. Leave the matter to me. As you wish, just leave it to me. Don't make me nervous, are we on the same page? Let's eat. Or listen. The scar on your face, I don't like it. Leave it, Naji. Let's eat. Come, let's talk. Let's eat, Naji. - The will get cold! - Come with me. What can I do with you? Where are you going? Yes, Naji, tell me. Ahmed… …I'll ask you a bunch of questions. Answer me without turning around. Where were you at 3:36 p.m. today? You mean in the afternoon? Nonetheless, answer me. At 3:36 p.m.? I went to the gym and then back home. No, I mean, I went to the farm. Oh, no, I came directly to you here. I can tell you are confused. Are you smoking? And blowing the smoke out as well? Ahmed, on today's date… how old are you? He put out the cigarette! Naji, you have mad cow disease. He's doing it again! Naji, what's wrong with you today? Ahmed, you are lying. What's wrong with your eye? Today I was exercising with my friend at the gym. So I had an accident. And as you can see, the bruises… Then I came to you here. Bullshit. Ahmed, you are dear to me. If there is something, don't hide it. Naji, if you need money, I will help you. Ahmed, I do not need money. I am good. I need to know what you are hiding. I know you are hiding something. Just tell me. Listen, when I exercise, I have to eat. So, you see why I'm confused, right? - I have to eat. Please, let's join them. - Let's go. Just a minute. Leave the cigarette. I will throw it away. No! - You'll start a fire. - The grass is green, come on. - Not dry? - No. Come with me. I am starving! Believe me, there'll be no fire. Hey, guys. - Welcome. - Thank you. What? Is that diet? Give me some. After exercise, the upper muscle… What do you call it? - BCAA. - Okay, good. No, bro! Hi, Naji. Hi, my dear. - How's things? - Everything is fine. I came to visit you and to eat. Listen, we do not offer free food. Either you pay or you'll end up in the hospital. Of course! I have to support my dear Naji. To make him successful. As well as to discover the demons. No demons here, believe me. And if there are any, they should be gone by now because of you. Please have a seat. We will treat you to the best food. But if you don't pay, we'll kick your butt. The best Mandi for the best cement mixer! - What's this? - We have to save you. For the next Eid sacrifice. - Come eat with me! - Would you leave something on the plate? Aha, you want your tip! I like you when you're smart. - It seems Naji didn't pay your salary. - No, he did not. - Naji! - No, no! I am leaving. Better for you. Naji! Naji! Naji! Naji! - Where are you going? - What do you mean? I thought the demons weren't real. You do have demons! You still need to pay! Where are you going? I'm surprised, to be honest. One demon is afraid of the other. I agree. We will get payment from you! Call your grandfather. He is late. He is late for the trip. Grandpa, where are you? I am coming. I had to say farewell to your grandma. My true love. Have you taken the luggage? What luggage? You only have a couple of things. - Come on. - Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Ride at the back. Quickly, Grandpa. - Move! - Move ahead! There you go! Thank you so much, Ahmed, for your help with the visa. Because it is a big deal to me. To be honest, without the artifact that should bring millions, I wouldn't help. I know you've always been malicious, always looking for money. I am kidding, Naji. You are my brother. I'm with you through good times and bad times. - Oh, look at that! - What? - Pull over! - To help her? Sure. Her car needs a tire replacement. Be careful not to hit her. - You help her. - I won't change the tire myself. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. You know, I've been feeling down all day. I've felt bad all day long. But when I just saw you, my mood flipped 180 degrees. Thank you. You're welcome. And now I will help you and replace the tire. But he's just done it! - Who? - This handsome guy. Thank you so much. You're most welcome. May I know your name? My name is Naji. You're such a biscuit. Oh, my heart! Ahmed, I am nervous. You say this guy is a biscuit. Can't you see all the sweetness here? - I swear he's not even a shawarma dish! - Relax, Ahmed. Stop being jealous. Do you have Snapchat? Ahmed, come here. - What? - What is "slab chat"? He doesn't even have WhatsApp! Answer me, is this a car garage? Oh, God, what a miracle! She chose him over me. What a miracle! It's all about livelihood. Oh my God, she gave him her number. My dear Ahmed, money is not everything. Wealth is not everything. Feelings are the most important things. Nice behavior and true feelings. Ahmed! Don't let girls come between us. Ahmed, listen to me. Ahmed, wait. Ahmed! God damn you! Where are we now? Wait a moment, Grandpa. Naji is on his way to us. Who's Naji? - Naji is your grandson. - Aha, yes! Sorry for being late. Welcome, Grandpa. Who's this? Naji. Who's Naji? Naji is your grandson! I'm afraid Grandpa has Alzheimer's? No, he was working fine a while ago. Sorry, I didn't give you his manual that tells you how he works. Naji! Missed you, Grandpa! Twenty years, Naji, and you haven't changed! What's wrong with you, Grandpa? I was with you last year. - Really? - I even brought you a watch as a gift. The watch that didn't work! But it's starting to work. Thank God! Welcome, Amer. - How is it going? - Everything is fine. But your grandfather embarrassed me. What happened? On the plane, he wanted to sit in the front behind the pilots. - "Bisbis" class? - "Bisbis" class. Sure. You want to put me in the back seats? I must be at the front. No worries when you leave. I will arrange your seat with the captain. - In the front? - In the front. No, put me in front. And put Amer near the toilet. - Amer, you should have lunch with us. - No, truly, Naji, I have something to do. - If you need me, just call me. - Okay, take care then. Bye. Hey. You forgot your bag. I'm sorry, I forgot it. Let's go, Grandpa. Who was that? Amer! - And what about you? - Oh my God. It seems we'll have to do this a lot. Raise your head, yes, like that. Naji! Welcome. That was Amer. Let's go. When will Grandpa arrive? He's late. Is he coming from Switzerland? No worries, he'll be here soon. If he were coming by parachute, he'd have arrived by now. Oh dear God, he's late! - Peace be upon you. - Hey, Naji! This is my grandpa. - Your grandpa? - Yes. - He looks thirsty. - Poor him. He's tired from the trip. This is my friend Ahmed. Aha, what a nice-looking guy! - Did I tell you that you look like him? - It's something we can't control. Dear God! This is Kindi. - This one is nasty. - Why, Grandpa? - He has no ethics. - Why? - No respect. - You've just arrived! How come he turns his back on me? He should talk to me face to face. No, Grandpa, this is his face. Look at his teeth. This is a face? Poor him. An accident? - He didn't have an accident. - No accident? No, Grandpa, no accident. His grandpa is wearing a coat on a kandora! Show some respect. This is Hani. He works for me. Welcome, Grandpa. The elephant kiss is for you. You are from Egypt? The mother of the world? We love you, oh, Grandpa! Wait, wait! We are tribes. Yes, like that. - What's wrong with you? Stop it. - I'm not responsible for the lower part. - You are Am Naji, Grandpa. - Yes. - Naji. - Yes? Your grandpa is so funny. No, he's so tired from the trip. - This is Omer. - No, Naji, let me introduce myself. My name is Omer. I love cars. And bikes. I'm speaking here… Your family know you're here? This is a kid. How did you bring him here? No, Grandpa, he is an adult. Naji, your grandpa has arrived, we have to show him the country! And make him happy. We'll go to the cinema with Grandpa Let's go, Grandpa We'll go to the cinema with Grandpa Let's go, Grandpa Beautiful! God help me while he's here! Ahmed, take care of Grandpa. He looks a bit different. Let's see what's next with this grandpa. Welcome, Grandpa, please come in. We were missing only one thing here in the house. An old man to appreciate here. You were missing a solid man. Someone powerful. Unlike you. I've been in shock since I arrived. I thought I would see a castle with people who work in it. It seems you are a loser. Grandpa, you misunderstood the idea of someone being an expatriate. It's the same as you have at home. We just need to work harder. The furniture is nice. Where did you get it from? - You like it? - Yes. - Thank God. - Where is it from? I brought it from Alsaaduhum. - What? - Alsaaduhum. Well done. They do not have only furniture. They have a mobile app as well. You select what you want, and they deliver it. You type in the app, and they deliver? You're such a liar. I swear I am telling the truth. It seems you are not sleeping well. Get lost, I want to rest. Want to rest? Come upstairs. No, I want to rest here, in front of the TV. I can't sleep without a TV. Grandpa, you do not even have a radio at home. And if you have one, it does not work. I've have renewed my Netflix subscription. You swear? I swear. It seems I am the loser. Listen, where is your demon restaurant? When you leave home, turn right. Then right again behind the house. The restaurant keys are under the TV. Okay, great. - What is it you've renewed again? - My Netflix subscription. I need a pillow. You take a rest. I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak from the evil of that which He created. Hey, demons. I seek refuge in the Lord… I call whoever haunted this body in this restaurant. You demons! This is my grandson Naji's restaurant. No demons or genies are allowed to enter here. I will beat you all up! I live with demons. I'm not afraid of you. Where are you? Where are you demons? I am Naji's grandfather. I seek refuge in the Lord. God damn you! - This is you! - God damn you. - I thought you were a demon! - Demons would leave when they see you. Where were you, Grandpa? I was looking for you everywhere. Looking for Grandpa, I even wanted to call the police. You treat me like a thief? Your grandpa is so dangerous. He did a move I never even saw in the Jackie Chan movies. Be respectful, Hani. This is my grandpa. What did he do to you? He threw me on the ground. I've never seen such a move. - Why? - He's working here? - Of course. - What's his name? - Hani. - I thought he was a demon. How come, Grandpa? Forgive me, Hani. He works for me, yes. Let's go out, Grandpa. God bless you, Grandpa. Go back home, Grandpa. God damn you and your grandpa. He believes he is so strong, but he is afraid of his own shadow. My dear friends, you know my situation. Please try to sell this piece for me. Guys, are you sure this piece is an artifact? You want to be sure? - Yes. - Look at his grandpa's face. His grandfather is wacky. Tomorrow he will say his slippers are artifacts and sell them for 200,000. It's so funny, huh? I could beat all of you. Be respectful. Behave yourselves. I assure you, this piece is worth more than 100,000. I am very sure. - Where are you, Naji? - Hi, Grandpa. This is the piece. Can I check? If we do our best, we could sell this piece for ten dirhams in the Chinese market. You aren't worth even seven dirhams! This piece is so old! Older than the generation of your grandmother… - Well done, Grandpa. He deserves it. - Again, the drama starts. Ahmed… I don't like these moves. No eating, no breakfast, no lunch. The children are starving. Sell the piece for me. To be honest, Naji, I can feel this piece is unique. And I believe it's worth a lot. I know it's worth a lot. But nothing is more valuable than you, Naji. God bless you, Grandpa. Who would appreciate you? You shut up! He said 100,000! This is worth more than that. Oh, God! I'm starting to feel good about you. And let me tell you, I know foreigners who would buy such artifacts. I've liked this guy since I met him. I love you! I will say this from now on. I love you! I love you too, Grandpa. Put it back. Ahmed, please do sell it. No worries. Just keep your grandpa away from me. Forget about him. He is acting normal. You look like a couple. Grandpa. Grandpa, I need tenderness. Who is Hanan? I need emotions. I need love. I'd like to get married, Grandpa. Oh, you are talking like me. What's wrong, Grandpa? You are an old man. I am a young guy. I want to get married. And by the way, I met someone in the street. An Asian girl. Does she speak our language? She speaks another language. So she doesn't represent our language, our traditions. She is not a good match for you. Grandpa, it's all about feelings. And leading in one direction. That is love. You idiot. Why, Grandpa? My son, it's marriage, not love. It was my mistake, I told you. Do you need tea? Bring anything. I was mistaken telling you about my feelings. Look who I am talking to! Peace be upon you. My name is Lucy. I will be your translator. Are you Arabic? No, but I learnt how to speak Arabic. Your language is beautiful. I swear the beautiful one is you! - Grandpa, you could go to the Corniche. - I swear it's a good idea. Naji, do something. Grandpa, let's sell the artifact first. So we get some money. - Relax. - She looks like a mermaid. No worries, dear. I can speak English fluently. Hey, you, shut up. Look how she translates. Focus on her vocal tone. Grandpa, are you recording music? What vocal tone? Let the deal close. Listen, Ahmed, ask them how much it's worth. How much are they saying? Five hundred thousand US dollars. Swear to me! Sit down, you are embarrassing me. Sell it at this price, let's finish it. Kindi, my friend, if you don't shut up, I will put my shoes in your mouth. Why is he not happy? Why is he saying no? Your guy doesn't want to sell. He is asking for two million. What the hell? This is my piece. What's wrong with you? Naji, do something about your grandpa. Grandpa, give us some time. Let us close the deal first. What do you want? - Say okay. - Okay. Great job, Ahmed! What's wrong with them? It seems their team won over the fat one. - I support the yellow team. - I support the fat one. Our team has won! - Why are you angry? - We sold it for one million! What did he say? Million, million. No way! He's paying one million? Grandpa, we sold it for one million! One million! - Your grandpa has died. - No worries. I'll get another one. - I have a million dollars! - Are you fine? The number is not fine. Give me your number. Take it easy with the tube. Naji, give me another one. Give him another one, Naji. - It seems he's trying to be healthy. - This one is not meant for a diet. I went to the gym. They told me it's full. 'Cause there's no machine that works for you. He went to a doctor and asked him how to follow a healthy recipe. The doctor told him to follow his own steps better. Leave the diet for other people. Call Ahmed and check where he is. You've made a mistake - by cheating me. - Please forgive me. - He has a feature. - Which is? When he's walking, you can't tell his face from his back. If I use the product, will I lose weight? At least change your mentality… NAIF …and start to be healthy. Respect your age. Okay, Naji, develop a recipe for him. Shut up. Anyway, Ahmed… Ahmed! What's wrong with you? Are your children calling you? No, Naji. He's wearing a chain. Just like an Indian mafia boss. Do not forget the yacht trip tomorrow. - The yacht trip? - Prepare yourself. Sure, as long as our guy is coming. - Have you installed a sensor yet? - I like him. You're wearing black. Are you the black GMC car? Listen, let's leave. I forgot to ask you. Are you the big machine or the small one? You cheated me. So your end should be like this. I will kill you today! Ahmed's not answering. How come? Aymen… Go find him. And bring him here ASAP! - Move! - Consider it done. I'm going with him. Tarik, finish him. I told you. He's worth nothing. You just wasted your energy. Hi, Grandpa. Welcome. Hi, Grandpa. How are you? Hi, captain. Welcome. Peace be upon you. Welcome, put this here. So that you can look good. Okay, Grandpa. - Let's go inside. - I am waiting for a guest. - What guest? - I am waiting for a guest. Uncle, the sun will hurt you. Who would hurt me? No one can hurt me. My dear, gasoline is expensive. I will fill it up. - The engine is on? - Yes. Your friends have arrived! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. How are you, Uncle Ali? God damn you. Why don't you send money to your mother? You disobedient son! Naji, what's wrong with your grandpa? He's an old man. Come inside. He needs to be treated well. How are you, Grandpa? Who's this? - We need to hit you again. - Hi, dear! Amer! Welcome, go inside. Let's go as well. Just wait for the guest. You've just arrived from the airport. When did you make any friends? Just one minute. - God, give me patience. - One minute. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. The place is nice. Is she your guest? No. We are tribes! We are lions! You are good to go. We do not have such relations. You are good to go. Listen. I will remain like that. - But I am sorry, she is my guest. - How did you get to know each other? Do you remember the translator? When you all left, I took her number. - You're joking! - We stayed in touch for several nights. God damn you! Together… Like the Titanic. Please get inside. We need to go to Mecca after this trip. Wait for me, guys. Wait for me. Wait for me. Today we are going to the sea. Peace be upon you, guys. How are you, tribes? Wow, you look great today. You are a bodyguard. Brave! I want to ask you, Naji. Your grandpa has just arrived from Yemen. When did he get the chance to meet people? Smart question from a stupid guy. My grandpa is sociable. He loves meeting new people. By the way, Grandpa, have you brought the mermaid with you? Shut up, you sea dog. I would beat you up. This is my grandpa. I feel the trip will be so sweet. Naji, I feel trouble is coming. Your grandpa believes in himself too much. Please, guys, just ignore it. He will spoil our mood. Just ignore it. Stay calm, the driver is here. What driver? I'm not a taxi driver. I am a captain! Guys, I need your attention so we go and come back with no issues. You have two exits on the left and right. You have 10 life vests. The life jackets are under your seats. No smoking. No smoking. Okay? No dancing and stuff. Okay? He speaks too much! Kindi, take it easy. We'll do whatever we want later on. Ignore him, my friend. Oh, this is Naji. I didn't recognize you. Who told him we are going to Thailand? He looks like a yacht driver. Guys, this is my sea look. I want to ask you, Uncle Naji. Do you know how to swim? Stay at your place. - Isn't it funny? - So silly. I know why it's not funny. It's all because of my sea style. Naji, what did Hani say? He asked me if I know how to swim. Tom and Jerry! Hey, do you have a headache? Yes, I do. Wear a bigger hat then. Leave it for me. Let me spoil you Like you deserve to be spoiled Shut up! What the hell are you doing? We do not need to hear your sounds. I will swim back to Yemen! No, Grandpa, we are sorry! Don't be angry. Last time! Yes, this is the last time. Okay, sit down and don't make a sound! Guys, nobody's allowed to dive here. The sea is too deep for swimming. Do not jump here, Grandpa. We will swim together, okay? Don't make any trouble, please. For God's sake. Captain, let's go! - Hey, Naji. - Hey. Why are you alone? I was trying the Titanic gesture. Bullshit, I am here enjoying nature. Thank God for all the wealth you have. I envy you for all that you have. As if I owned this yacht! Look around. We rented it. Naji, I want to talk to you about something. Since we are here alone. If you don't mind. Go ahead. We are on this trip for relief. Thank you, Naji. Why don't you sell me your restaurant? Oh God… The sea is endless. Naji? - Did you hear me? - Yes. - What did I say? - You want to buy the restaurant. - So? - I did not answer. Because it makes no sense. I built that restaurant. And then I will give it to you? I am thankful for everything. I don't waste my money. You forgot, Naji, how much I supported you. When you come to the country, you had nothing. And do I have to return the favor? - Yes, support me. - Okay. Let's do it, let's have a photo. Not supporting me like that! I helped you with money and everything. You even lived in my house. Did I ask you for any of that? No. You were generous, and you supported me. I did not ask you for anything. Accept the consequences. - Need anything else from me? - No. Then good luck. Awadh, I was just kidding. - Just say done. - Done. The restaurant is yours! I swear I expected this from Am Naji. - But on one condition. - Tell me. Every year you pay me 500,000. Naji! I am kidding. The guys are calling us for the lunch. Come here quickly! Guys, it's lunch. Come on, guys. Naji! Listen, Grandpa. Tell me. If we get that money, what do you think about starting a business? - What? - A business. Okay. Go ahead. I will support you. Go with your ambitions. So listen to my idea. The first thing I will open is a four-story restaurant. With 40 employees. And get married four times. And buy a large car. The latest model. I want to be like a king. What about an airplane? Not like this, son. Start small. Then you expand. We have the money. Still, start small. Okay, give me an idea. - I have got one. - What? I was thinking about it all night long. What is it? Hit me. No use, I totally forgot it. - Are you sure? - I forgot it. - Shall I hit you again? - No use. Guys, what project ideas do you have? I have a good one. We buy bikes and rent them out to kids. Or cars, and we rent them to adults. Shut your mouth, you loser, or I will hit you with this. Bikes for kids? Really? It's risky, a kid might get injured. And we'll get in trouble. People can stop doing everything. But not eating. Open a restaurant. Great. A food truck. A food truck is a good idea, Grandpa. "Food track"? What is a "food track?" I don't know, to be honest. What is a "food track?" Listen, food truck means a mobile restaurant. One day here, another day there. Anywhere. Love it. But how can we do it? Leave it to me, just wait for my call. I will update you with the result. Forget now about your projects. The music is on. And people are dancing like crazy. I want to dance. Ahmed, I'm coming! Let's dance. I know you're a big teenager. - Hi, Grandpa. - No, hello to you. Twenty times I called you. Really, you are a donkey! Where are you? What are you doing? I am on my way to Omar. To see the progress on the food truck. It's been a while since we sold the artifact! Haven't you opened the restaurant yet? Grandpa, please stop it. Stop it! You are a loser. And a failure. You don't know how to plan and work. I never saw you successful. I helped you, and you still haven't even started a simple project. Open the restaurant, run your business like a man. Do what I tell you. Hello? Hello? I can hear you, Grandpa, keep talking. I am telling you to listen to my advice and do everything I am advising you. The reason you are a loser is that you're not listening to me! Are you there? Hello? Are you there? Grandpa, I'm busy. I'll call you later. The fool hung up. Take it easy. What are you doing up there? God has created us with legs to walk. Why like that? What do you think about the landing, Naji? It was… bad. Come on, Naji, it's a hobby. I love bikes, cars and now flying. If I got a chance to dive, I would do it. God bless you. It's madness. Listen, let's go to the "food sharack." Food truck. A mobile restaurant. Go, I will follow you. I will wait for you in the car and get rid of this toilet fan. A toilet fan? You are a problem. SPOIL YOUR STOMACH AND ORDER MANDI (RICE WITH CHICKEN) - Hello? - Hi, Lucy. How are you? Everything is fine. I am home alone and bored. What do you say about going shopping together? To the malls in Ajman. Done! I'll be there in 30 minutes. I'll take you around Ajman to buy clothes. Done. I'll be waiting for you. Bye for now. Surely, I need to take a shower. What do you think? No, of course not! Okay. Please, Lucy, I loved this one. What do you think? Now you look good! Oh yeah! Look at me, Lucy. I swear this is the best one. I won't take it off unless I am at home. Do you like it? A bit. Let's go. Come over. Yeah! Oh my God. This is the first time Grandpa has been late. Normally, he tells me where he is. At least to update me. - Ahmed, shall I call the police? - No, Naji, not like that. What's wrong with you, Naji? He is not a kid. Maybe he's at the cafe or taking a walk. Don't overreact. I bet he traveled to Thailand with Lucy. Grandpa is old. And he can have a relationship in a week. Learn from him how to be better, Ahmed. First of all, Ahmed is good at these things. And we can depend on him. Unlike on you. I will tell you your story. We got you in our group. You were without friends. We said this poor guy is without friends, so we brought you in. Look at what he's saying. When ladies see me, they send me a kiss. And when I enter a mall, all the girls fall for me. - Yeah, right. - Thank you. Is he stupid? Do you know why girls fall for you? Because you create an earthquake. This is the truth, man. I found comfort… Hi, guys. What are you talking about? These are the most beautiful moments in my whole life. Since that translation your grandpa has changed! What translation? Who did this to you? Where is my grandpa from the old days? He enters the village, everybody falls silent. Let them go to hell. I care only about her. When she cares about me. Who's she? My grandma? Your grandma? I discovered after 40 years that your grandma is my cousin. - Who? - Of course, I mean Lucy! Grandpa, this is not good. Grandpa, you look amazing! Your style is like this. Grandpa is dangerous. I'm tired, and I have to go, so excuse me. Your grandpa's style is bullshit. Yes, yes. I just realized my grandpa is crazy. I'm afraid he will marry Lucy and embarrass us in our society. And they will make fun of us. Believe me, he would do it. He's an old teenager. To be honest, they are a good match. Hey, guys. He's my grandpa. Sorry. What are you doing, Grandpa? I am playing a game. What game? I want to talk to you. - Yes. - I'm afraid you got upset downstairs. Do I look upset? And I was singing. Correct. But I am the one who's upset. Go to hell. Go to hell? Don't you care about my feelings? Of course, I love you. And I care about you. Tell me what you need. Today is my restaurant's opening day. I don't see you interested or prepared. What should I do? Tell me. For instance, change your clothes. So I feel my grandpa is supporting me. Listen, I've never been more prepared like this. Lucy chose some amazing outfits for me! Be thankful you are my grandpa. Leave Lucy, Grandpa, and wear something suitable. Mm-hmm. For example, wear the Emirati traditional clothes. Great idea. You will look great. I swear it's the best choice. - I'd like to try it out. - Let's go. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. Congratulations! Take it easy, Naji. We paid money for the balloons. - Why are you blowing up the balloons? - It's fine to blow up balloons. Stop doing it! You are bothering me! To be honest, Naji and Uncle Ali, Naji proved himself as a real man. He's a man whether you like it or not. Hit it. In this case, no one starts the ceremony but you. Of course, I won't let anyone else. Because this is my right. What are you doing? I just left my place, you directly took it. I know now where you lost your money. It's on your public relations. No worries, Grandpa. Today is a great day. I propose a toast on this occasion, the ceremony of Am Naji Restaurant. I have an important speech. Okay, go ahead. Go there and shoot a video. - Can't I just share the ceremony with you? - No, stand over there. - Give me your mobile, mine is charging. - Come here. Wait. - Why like this, Grandpa? - What? You put her in my place? So the ceremony becomes brighter. With you, it looks dark. Guys, today and because of this great occasion, I've brought two pieces of news. One is good and the other is bad. The good news is: this restaurant exists because of my money. And this guy did nothing about it. Grandpa, are you going to humiliate me now? In the future as well. - Keep talking. - The other piece of news is bad for you. But to me it's good news. Everything inside this restaurant belongs to Lucy. She can eat anything any time. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It will be for free for her. It's my money, and it's my call. Good? Thank you, Ali. Yes! Prepare take-away food for her. A photo, Grandpa. This is for my grandma. God damn you. Why? Start the ceremony. I swear I will send it now. Delete it please. This is your restaurant. Well done. I'll send the photo to grandma. - Please don't. - This is enough! You humiliated me in front of the guys. Naji… Oh, look at you, Grandpa! You look amazing. Looking great. It's not your time. I feel like there is dust on his face. After two days he will feel there's dust there. True, after two days. Anything you want to say. Just delete the photo. - Anything you need from him, tell me. - Okay. I am blackmailing him. Omar, how are you? I need your advice. Should I buy a bike? Or a car for drifting? I don't know what to do. Listen, Ahmed, those are two different things. Bikes and cars are two different worlds. We called you many times. With no answer. We waited for you. And you didn't come. What happened? My dear Ali, as you can see, it's the opening ceremony of my friend's restaurant. And I don't want you to embarrass me here. Don't be late. Consider it done. Those are my friends. Everything is fine. We'll talk about bikes later. Let's enjoy our time now with Naji. Naji, when are you going to open the restaurant? Good morning, Grandpa. Bad morning to you! What happened? What time is it? It's 12 p.m. - And what time is breakfast? - What breakfast? We do not sell breakfast! Only lunch and dinner. From now on, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Do you understand? Okay, breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is no business yet! Aha, that's why you are losing. If you did breakfast, you could gain some blessings. But you do only lunch and dinner. From now on, breakfast, lunch and dinner! I will ask Am Naji. Oh, you scared me. You and Naji are working for me. And my word is an order. Okay, we will do whatever you want. You're blabbering too much. I'll talk to you later. - Okay, Grandpa. - I'm going to the golf course. Golf? You're going to play golf? Take care of your eyes then, Grandpa. God help you, Naji. Yeah, amazing shot! Even though it's not in the hole. Now it's your turn. Yes, sure, but I want to tell you something. Do you know I was the best player in the world? Are you sure "in the world?" Sorry, I mean, in our village. Do you have a golf club in your village? Yes, sure. But the issue was we rented the club course from another village. So how do you measure the distance to the hole? Oh God, how am I going to pass this? By feel. By feel. Oh, Ali! She doesn't know how I feel about her. There you go. Come on. In the name of God. No, not like this. Oh, great achievement, Grandpa! I spent an hour looking for you. Hani told me you went to play golf. I was shocked. But now I know why you are here. You always arrive at the wrong time! You always do that. What's up? Since when do you play golf? The biggest sport you do at our village is playing Kerum. I know how to play golf! This is the kings' game, my son. And with my money, I do whatever I want to do. Yeah. I know why God did not bless you before. You show your strength to me. But you never do that to strangers. I wanted to ask you. Did you think about my marriage plan? My dear, I have no objections. I have only one objection. Which is your wrong choice. She's not from our traditions. She doesn't speak our language. How would you understand each other? Choose one that is close to us. You have convinced me. But what about your case? Damn you. This is something else. Anyway, let's play. Let's kick this off. This is the right way to play golf. Watch this. What are you doing? This is how we play it at the village. - Bring another ball. - No, this is wrong! It's not like that! Never! Where is the hole? This is our golf style! Ali, do you think Ahmed can do it? It's not his choice. He already took his money. I believe he can do it. What if he gives the money back? What should we do then? I don't need his refund. He should do the mission ASAP. Why don't we do the mission ourselves? We did all the previous jobs. This is a unique mission. And I don't want to draw attention to us. Let's play it safe. The jerk has arrived. Peace be upon you. Is no one going to reply? I will go out and come back again. You will reply, okay? Guns? You rented them to scare me? Oh, I know it's not funny. When will you carry out the mission? You are only jerking around. I'm walking around. This guy sent me the wrong location. Don't fool around. I am talking about the mission. Ali, you know the mission is too risky. And I have to prepare it right. So it won't fail. I don't want to hear "fail" from you. Or else I will kill you! Calm down. And be patient with me. The plan won't fail. I told you not to use that word again. I promise I won't talk about failure. I'm a loser because I mentioned that word. I am a failure. That's the last time you'll say that word! Or else I will kill you! Don't play with me. There are nine bullets in this gun. Don't play games. Complete the mission before I terminate you. Can you calm down? Tarik, the date of the operation is close. I promise I won't let you down. This is for sure. Get lost. And complete the mission ASAP. Till then I don't want to see you! Move! It's been a while now. Will you tell me or not? Listen, Kindi. I want to tell you something so important. And I need your help. If it's about money, consider it done. I will go and get it. No, Kindi. I don't need your money. I know you don't have any. What are you saying? Right, right. Look, the thing is… That's why I need your help, Kindi. Oh God, are you stupid? Gangs, stealing, action movies! Are you crazy? Take it easy. The plan is so perfect. Even if the plan is perfect, I won't go to jail because of you. Do you know what would happen? Kindi, I chose you because you're good, and I can depend on you. Believe me, you will get a big amount of money which will turn your life around 180 degrees. Do you want the truth? I don't care about money. As long as you chose me, I am in. They say I look like someone in the mafia. Correct, you are like a mafia guy. You have two days to give me your answer. No, I will answer you now. No, you have two days. Are you in a hurry about the money? What if I have the answer now? Welcome. What are you doing here? Are you trying to cheat our customers? Do not get in touch with our customers. This is my old customer. Get lost! She came to us, not to you. Listen. Listen, I don't want trouble. Get lost. - Yes, madam, what is your order? - What order? I told you this is our customer. God damn both of you! Get lost! Why did you do this? I will show you what I will do! - Grandpa! - You scared me! What's wrong, Hani? - What's wrong? - He's taking our customers! Listen, I don't repeat my words twice. Don't bullshit me. I will beat you up! You and Am Naji are driving me crazy! Hi. Put down your hands. If you raise your voice against Grandpa, I will beat you up! Is he your grandpa? Everyone's grandpa! - Is he your grandpa? - Yes. I'll turn your moustache into a calendar with holidays on Thursdays and Fridays! I've heard a lot about you, Naji. - Today we've met. - So don't make me angry. What would you do if you became angry? Tell me. I swear I'll rearrange your face. Listen, go ahead and leave. These people don't like to be treated well. You go inside! You too. Oh God. Today we are gathered for blessings. And also to enjoy a great meal from the Am Naji Restaurant. Not under his management but mine. You will see the difference. A big difference. You can't imagine. Wait, guys. Today we have a free day. What do you think of exercising tomorrow? No objection at all. - And you? - For me, I will be watching you. - I'll burn all those calories tomorrow. - Let's eat. In the name of God. All this grease… Say your prayers. Come on, Kindi. No, wait! Wait! Ali! Keep going! You do exercise, huh? Exercise is good for your health. You have time for exercise. But not for our thing. Even if we're going to the gym, it's none of your business. Ahmed, stop your guys, or you'll be sorry. The talk is between us only. You scared us. If we do not stop, what will you do? We won't let anyone annoy Ahmed. Guys, the thing will be done this week. We are waiting. And as the old saying goes, every delay… has its benefits. Why does this one speak in slow motion? - That fits you! - The subtitles are below. What the hell is he saying? Ahmed. To be honest, when I saw you with those people, I had a bad feeling. Tell us the truth. Who are those guys? You know, I've been suspicious about you recently. - It seems you know what the issue is! - No, I don't have any idea. Until yesterday. And he did not give me anything! Stop it and let us hear from Ahmed. Listen, we are your brothers. We need to support you. What brothers? Brothers? Every day he uses a different car. And expensive stuff. Ahmed, tell us the story. Have you finished talking? I need to have pocket money, okay? I want to live like normal people! I get bored from the same routine. Every day I go from home to the gym. My car is old. That's why her father rejected me four times. I don't have good clothes to wear. Why is everyone better than me? A great actor. You surprise me with your drama acting. Ahmed, my dear, one clean dirham is better than illegal millions. In a few words tell me what's wrong. Naji, here's how it started… - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - Tarik, how are you? - Good, Ahmed. - Sorry for being late. - It's fine, please have a seat. - What would you like to drink? - Spanish latte. Or make it an espresso. I can see you've become wealthy. A new life, huh? Nothing is impossible, Ahmed. If you want to be like me, it's possible. I didn't get you. Look, Ahmed, I won't make it long for you. I'll tell you the truth straight away. I would love to hear it. What would you say if someone gave you half a million dirhams? Loads of money. Half a million? That's a huge sum. How can I say this to you? I know it's a huge sum of money and worth it. The mission is not an easy task. A secret mission. And I am sure, Ahmed… no one can do it but you. That's why I have chosen you. What is the mission? The mission? Have a look? But this is a dangerous mission, Tarik. It could get me in big trouble. Don't you want money? Don't you want to change your life? This much money is worth the risk. Look, think about it. And get back to me. Once you've decided, I will arrange a meeting with our boss. Who's that boss? You're always in a hurry. Think about it first, and if you say yes… I will arrange a meeting with the boss. By the way… the bill has been paid. Oh yeah, you think you're a gang member? Do you realize what killing means? Do you really think I would kill someone, Naji? I needed the money, that's all. What money? Look at yourself. You have expensive clothes. Money is not everything. Don't tell me you had to do this. Omar, please understand. I am telling you I was in need. And it was a huge sum of money. Guys, take it easy on him. What the hell! You got involved in such a problem. Solve it yourself. - I'm your friend, Naji. And you leave me? - Do you understand what friendship is? You should tell your friends first. Not at the last moment! You know, you are not respectable. Behave yourself, Naji! I've been here since morning just for you. I will fix this issue myself! It's your problem. - Go to hell. - Get lost! Where is he? I called him, he's on his way. Here he comes. Ali, as I promised, I have accomplished the mission. I have killed Mohammed Well done. Really well done, we didn't expect it. Okay, how can you assure us you killed him? I knew you wouldn't believe me. So I brought you the proof. Great job. Well done. I believe… we are done here. Bye. This is what I expected to happen. That you would betray me. What did you expect? To take the money and leave? We own you, and we can own anyone. I've already spent all the money. If you are a real man, fight me without the gun. My dear criminal friends, I am sorry to interrupt you. Mr. Criminal, do you have a toilet here? I am diabetic. How did you get inside? I got inside by walking in. I know, but what do you need? Naji, where are you? Who's Naji? Naji! That would be me. Drop your guns. Or I will kill your boss. God damn you, baldhead. You're bald and a criminal. Two issues at once! - Give me the gun. - You bald man! Give me the gun. You are my man, Grandpa. - A criminal and a looter. - You are my man. Would you please hold this for me? Thank you so much. Now I have the gun. Grandpa, who annoyed you? The jerk beside you. He deserves 20 bullets and might remain alive. Now I will… We arrived just at the right time! Sorry, Ahmed, about how we entered. You have embarrassed me. No one move! It's true, my friend and I have no weapons. But we'll beat you up! What do you mean no weapons? I am carrying a bomb. I will blow up the whole place! My friend has a bomb. He will do it! Nobody move! Nobody move! - He has a gun! - Put your gun on the ground. How wonderful. You jerk, looter! Long live the government! What do you think now, Ali? You're still alive? I am. But tell me. Do you still want to buy the stable? I got myself in trouble. And I will solve it myself. Get lost! 22 HOURS EARLIER Thank God, you have a true friendship. I ask God to keep you all together always. But Ahmed has made a huge mistake. And troubled us with this gang. But I assure you, Ahmed, I will support you till the end. What's wrong, Grandpa? I am sorry, Grandpa. I'm not crying about you, stupid. This other idiot's words have touched me! Your words have reminded me of your father. How he was brave and generous. Grandpa, are you insulting or praising me? - I don't know. - Your grandpa is wasting our time. Let's talk about Ahmed's issue. Ahmed's solution is with me. I have the perfect plan for this dumbness. It will solve the whole problem. I am so thankful, Grandpa. I just need a cigarette. The door is over there. Mohammed, tell us your story with the gang. They're causing you and Ahmed trouble. What's your story with them? My story with them is a long one. How are you, Mohammed? What are you doing here in the stable? You know why we are here. I told you many times. I won't sell the farm. I will increase the offer by a million. Even if it were a trillion, I wouldn't sell my farm. And I know why you need it. Don't talk too much. What do you mean? You think I am stupid or I don't understand? A stable outside the city. You want it for your illegal activity. Illegal or legal, it is none of your business. Selling it is better than losing your life. Are you threatening me here? Get out of here, all of you! Or else I will call the police. Get out! We are leaving. But that was your last chance. Get out of here! And this is the whole story. It's good you told me. I will talk to the police now. No, don't tell the police. Yesterday I saw a movie. And I have a great plan. We take Ahmed's face and put it in the device. The device makes masks. Once we have Ahmed's face mask, I'll wear it so they think I am Ahmed. But no, I am not Ahmed, I am Kindi. They remove the mask, they see Kindi. But I am not Kindi, I am Omar. Okay, Grandpa, tell them your plan. The plan is to protect you. In the first place. Because it's a perfect plan. One hundred percent. We will rescue you. Even since I met you, you've looked like a dead person. You will die either by poison or accident. The gang, I will take care of them. A perfect plan. What about Omar? Yes, Omar. You are the key to the plan. You are the action guy. Planes, submarines, tanks… You know the plan. You have chosen the right guy. By the way, my entry will be good. I will do it with Kindi. No, no wait. Look, I have a better plan. Let's be late to the party. We go in after all of them have died. We see them dead, then we leave. Guys, I am in a bad situation. And you keep joking around? Please tell Mohammed the plan, so I can get rid of this problem. - Grandpa. - Yes? Tell him the plan. The plan is… Just listen to me. I'll tell you the details of the plan. The plan is… Which plan? Which one? Grandpa, the plan to protect Mohammed. What? Sorry, guys. I know how to make him function. Okay, the plan. The plan is… - Ahmed, how does it look? - Good. More to the left. - More blood. - I know you're a director. Get out of frame. Okay. - How's the photo? - A criminal! So powerful! - Take them to the car. - They kicked you out. How come you are here? You are a kid! Looks like Papa Smurf. My hand! My hand hurts so much! You forgot this one. Don't know if he's dead or alive. What do you think? Do you like what I did? I swear to God… Don't get involved in such trouble again. Money is not everything. Grandpa. I swear you are a real man! - What do you think about our entry? - Ahmed, I'm sorry I was late. To be honest, Grandpa, we will surely miss you. I'll also miss you all. - But there is some good news. - What? I have residency now. So I will be back for sure. - No way! - I swear. - Grandpa? - Yes, dear? I am grateful to you. Don't know what to say. Not at all, my son. It's our duty to support you. But things don't always work out. So next time, if you get into trouble again, if you get into trouble again, I will call the police! To be honest, Grandpa, you are so wise. For Ahmed, next time I will call the police. Baby shark, who brought this kid here? Naji, do not bring him next time. Kids are not allowed to be here at such a late hour. Naji, talk to your grandpa. You know, no one asked you to speak. Your love has arrived. - Ali. - Yes? I came to bid farewell to you. My love, where have you been for so long? I've been waiting for you a long time. Take it easy. Tell me how to speak English. I will teach you, don't worry. I will be here waiting for you. Damn it. Oh yeah! Take it easy. What did she say? I won't tell you that. Keep standing. Grandpa. Next time you come here, I'll bring you someone more beautiful than Fucy. I mean, Lucy. You are such a big "foosie." No need to reply, take it easy. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. - How are you, guys? - We're good. - All is fine? - Amer, you look great. You look amazing! - How are you, Grandpa? - Who's this? Amer. Ah, sorry. - I am Amer! - No use. Again. - He's shocked. - Hit me again. Yes, it's me, Amer. What a nice dress! Who brought you at the wrong time? I was talking to my love. Who's she? This is Lucy. And next time when you talk about her, be respectful because one day she will be your grandma! This is my grandma? What? Grandma? - Yes. You as well. - Great. I will send your photo to Grandma in Yemen. Yes, play the poor man. I will send it to her. You'll see. Let's go, guys. - What? - Take care of yourself. What? Your grandma. Take your bag. Take care of yourself. Farewell. Oh, Ahmed. Naji! Grandpa has left! - Yes, he left. Stop acting. - Thank God. - Grandpa has left. - Thank God. The gang is gone. Thank God. But you know, Naji… What? I am missing my love. You want to flip again like a dog? No, this time I have a new way. - What is it? - I'll use the back door. But her father will still be there. Come with me. How do I look? A new look Anyway Listen to me, demons Be a man if you desire her - You think I'm not? - Marry her - I want to marry her - What you're doing is wrong You shouldn't do such deeds I mean to go and ask her hand Talk to her dad and tell him what's up I want to marry your girl I have money, I want to have children I mean to go and ask her hand Talk to her dad and tell him what's up I want to marry your girl I have money, I want to have children I love her, but I am afraid To get rejected Because I have a background Afraid of what?
