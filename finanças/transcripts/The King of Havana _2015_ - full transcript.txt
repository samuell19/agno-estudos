CENTER OF HAVANA 1994 SPECIAL PERIOD Rey! Nelson! Come down and fetch some water! Yeah, keep jerking off like that! - Shut up! - Get out of here! What do you want? Go fetch some fucking water! Move your asses! Hey, leave them alone. Stop provoking them. Jerking off when they're hungry will kill them. In my house I do what I want. You're just a whore! Yeah, but with my cooch. And we live twenty times better than you do, cretin, pig! Fredesbinda, fuck you, bitch! - Go home. - Let go! Go on, take your kid to bed and give him a bottle. Come here... Ma, go on home. I'll whack you! - Don't insult me again, bitch! - Let go of me! Come on, let's go. Magdalena, we saw nothing. I don't want trouble, so don't say anything. Grandma... Grandma! What happened here? Nothing. You saw nothing? No, I saw nothing. Stand up. And close your fly, shithead. Take him away. It's obvious the boy pushed the woman, she fell on the wires and got roasted. He pushed the other boy through here and he fell into the street. And that old woman? She died of a heart attack, there was no violence. He's acting dumb so he needn't confess. Any witnesses? Not in this neighborhood, no one ever sees anything. Go on, get showered. Look how scrawny this mulatto is. Well? How'd you like this animal for your pretty ass? Why are you looking at me like that? Why? Five on the black guy! The mulatto's going under. Permission to sit. Some other day. What happened? A black guy wanted to fuck my ass. Speak properly. There are no blacks, whites or mulattoes here. They're all inmates. All right, then. Change black guy for inmate. You think you're funny? I asked a question. Answer me. No, I'm not funny. Let me tell you something. I'm the one who decides how long you'll be here. If you keep fighting and behaving like this you'll be here until you turn 18, and when you do you'll go straight to jail. Is that clear? So the crocodiles can eat you. Get out. You have to be tough here so they don't fuck your ass. But without that guy finding out. OK, and from now on I won't even fart. THE KING OF HAVANA ...or lighting the other one. Look. It's the kind of circuit we use on the stairs. You flick the switch and when you're on the third floor, how do you turn it off? We have another switch and you turn it off from up there. And viceversa, of course. However, this circuit here is what we call a "parallel" circuit. Why is it "parallel"? Because you can turn off one and the others will remain lit. Fuck, he can run! That thief stole from me! He's getting away! He's getting away! Don't cry. Men don't cry, they don't cry. Fredesbinda, do you remember me? No, I don't. I'm Reynaldito, I lived over here. Oh, kid, for God's sake! You look a real mess. Worse than when you lived here. What were you doing with that stone? Getting rid of all the shit that's landed on me. Men have to be strong, love, or die. Next time I'll do it harder and kill myself. Don't say that. Don't hurt yourself, that's very bad. Come on, I'll heat up something for you to eat. What happened my family? I don't know, they took them to the morgue. Where were you all this time? I signed on a ship, as a sailor. Sure. What was the ship like? Same as all the others, with a sail like this. Life's been kind of hard on you, hasn't it? Or have you been hard on life? I'm heating water so you can have a bath. Eat up, love, you look very thin and neglected. What's that junk? It's not junk, sweetie. They're mementoes of the deceased. He was a real man. He left me pregnant four times. He'd screw me, wearing his uniform and with his pistol in his belt. He'd pull out his dick and his balls through his fly! Are you from old Havana? No, I'm from the Center. Why do you ask? Because your balconies have fallen. If you knew what these balconies have done for this revolution! History. - Want a drop of rum? - Yes. And your daughter? We won't talk about that. Why? She went off with a very dark, very mean negro. She lives around here but she never comes to see me. They all went off and left me on my own. Dump those stinking clothes and have a bath. Look at that, it's a rag. I’ve got clean clothes you can use. - What did they do with the room? - What room? Where we lived. A family from the east of the island moved in. I don't know how they all fit. If you want, we can pass by there, to see about the place. I think you've got a right to it. No, I'm not interested in that. Baby. What a beautiful cock! You're filthy. Sit down. When was the last time you had a bath? Look how dirty this is. You're crazy, you've got a pearl! Two. I heard about them but I’ve never seen one. I got them in China. The chicks are around me like flies. You are one crazy bastard! You've got a golden cock. I have to find a pistol. A pistol? What for? So you can put it in your belt and screw me. Are you crazy? I don't want pistols or any of that. - Why? - Because I don't. - But why not? - I just don't. On, baby! Yeah, suck me off! Baby, the pearl is trembling. Pearls! There's two of them! Yes, two, baby. Come on. Look at you, Fredesbinda, on your knees and sucking cock! - Come here, old lady. - Yes, baby. Come on, stick it into me. Like that, baby, so it hurts. Great ass. Go on, take it, take my cream. My dead love, forgive me, but I’ve got it here. I’ve got a cock here. Go on, enjoy it. Kid, you're the King of Havana! - I’m just Reynaldo. - No, baby, no. You're the King, the King of Havana. Sir, where do you get those dolls? What dolls? Like that one. That's St. Lazarus. St. Lazarus is a street. Go away. Can't you see I'm keeping a promise? I'm not going to hurt you. Stop acting the loser, get out of here. Lend me the doll. You don't lend saints. Go away! Get your peanuts here. They're freshly made, nice and hot. Get some now. Get your peanuts here. They're freshly made. Get your peanuts here. They're freshly made. Here. I'm broke. Pay me when you can. I'll do it just for you. Why just for me? I want to give it to you. They're pretty, aren't they? What? The kites. Oh, yeah. Sometimes there are ten or twelve at the same time. How old are you, kid? Twenty. Don't tell lies. You're a boy. Yeah, but with a tremendous cock. Don't talk to me like that. Stop joking. I'm not joking. It's the truth. Here. Gut rot! You were called Reynaldo, weren't you? Rey, but now they call me the King of Havana. You'll have to prove that. I don't have to prove anything. It's what they call me. I'm going home. You coming? OK, grab your saint. - And you? - Me what? What age are you? Too old for you. - You must be thirty-something. - Twenty eight. - Twenty eight? - Yeah, twenty eight. Well, come in. What will your husband say? What husband? I'm free, independent and sovereign. With that body and that smile... You're really on your own? Hey! Even if you don't believe it. How long have you been on your own? A week? What's it to you? Your mother told me you were with a black guy. - Were you watching me? - Me? Watching you? It wouldn't be the first time, or don't you remember jerking off in the henhouse? Yeah. You loved to get me going. You and all of Havana. That's why your mother's so happy. She's gaga, she invents things. She's furious because no one screws her. Time passes, and a woman's ass is like a clock. - Yeah, but your mother's still chimes. - Go insult your own fucking mother. My mother's dead. I'm sorry... Yeah, she died laughing, telling yours to go fuck herself. Bar the door. We're illegal here, this place could collapse any lime. There's no light, no water, no gas. I'm going to cleanse you because you're dragging bad deaths after you. Stop it, I don't believe in any of that. I don't even believe in me. You're crazy. You're crazy. Yeah, but from the waist down, baby. Mad crazy for putting black guys' cocks inside me. Big, thick, black... Like yours, baby. I'm not black, don't make that mistake. But you're a gorgeous mulatto and I really like you. I'm getting a hard-on. Oh, yeah, that's great, baby. Your feet smell like dead rats. And here you really stink. Don't act high-class, your cooch reeks, and it tastes great. That's so good. Gently, baby, gently. Enjoy me first. That's it. Oh, Rey. My king. My King Rey. It beats jerking off in the henhouse. Shut up, you're driving me crazy. What did you think? What did you think? Tell me. Go on, bitch! Scream! If you're the King of Havana, I'm the Queen. The Kingdom of Havana! You look like a monkey shitting. My ass and my cooch are on fire. You really did me in, baby. That's because you're old. I feel great. A letter for you know who. I really like you, baby. Screw me like that again and I'll fall in love for ever. Don't get slushy. I'd like to be your whore and give you money. If I could do the streets and earn dollars you'd live like a real king! I'd even buy you one of those gold chains. Stop dreaming. Why? Just don't. You're filthy and worn out. Oh, Rey, I don't know why but I'm going to help you. Here. Sell these for seven pesos a pack. They cost more in dollars. You needn't give me anything. Go see the gravedigger in the Cotorro, and say I sent you. He's an old guy called Celso. He'll give you work. And don't get lost, baby. You're capable of that and a lot more. I'm a daughter of Ochún and you'll go places with me. Here. Eat something, you earned it. So, am I the King of Havana or not? See you tonight. Wait here a minute. Less and less people are coming to funerals. Things are bad enough without shedding more tears. They should just burn all the bodies. And we'd be out of a job. How about that? That's true. Listen, twenty nine years coming here every day. From Monday to Sunday. - Not one free day. - Fuck! Not even one? None. You must like the dead. So you're happy here. I was only happy the day I got married. I’ve never had another day's happiness. This is my special reserve, from my private cellars. Your what? You're ignorant and uneducated. No one can talk to you. OK, be here tomorrow at 8:00. But we have to seal the crypt with cement. I'll do it. Go on. An advance. Thanks. Have a drink. Noway, I’ve had enough. Kid, you never say that. Never. A real man never says that. Oh, that's so good! Oh, honey, you know it all. Magdalena! Open the door! Fucking faggot! What? What is this? You're a whore! Stay there, Robertico. He couldn't pee his way out of a paper bag. Who the hell do you think you are? My husband or what? lam your husband! You have to respect me. No, you're a shit-for-brains loser who doesn't have a fucking cent. - What are you, a millionaire? - Listen. That old guy pays me 20 or 30 pesos to get in my pants and he doesn't even get a hard-on. He doesn't? I heard you moaning like crazy. Acting, sweetheart, acting. You have to act a lot with old guys. And I don't care if they get a hard-on, if they stick it in or leave it out. I’ve had 500 cocks inside me since I was eight and I'll have 500 more before I die, so don't get fucking tough with me. - You're a slut. - Listen, come down to earth. Every time I can make money with an old guy, I do it. I open my legs and they can give me tongue if they want. So you can wait outside or you can disappear. Sorry, darling, were you scared? Why are you groping me, fag'? It was just a caress. Some fucking caress! Don't hit me, stop! Fuck, you really hurt me. Who said you could jerk me off'? It was no big deal. I couldn't resist the temptation. I'm a man. We're all men here, unfortunately. Hey, I like being a man. Come off it. Anyone who isn't out of the closet here has got the door open. What are you doing there? I'm waiting for Magda. That whore dumped you. Come in. Why? You caught me in a good mood. Shut the door! Shit! Where did you get the light and all this? We've just met and you're checking up on me. You'd be a terrible husband. Hey, hey, what's bugging you? "Hey, hey", no. I don't like coarse talk, or being treated badly. That's how I am, like a princess, like Lady Di. That's why my friends call me Yunisleidi. Something to eat? Yes. Why don't you have a bath? A bath? Yes, you can be poor but not destitute. You can't go through life like a pig, forgive me. I can't swim, I can't dance, I don't like music, or water, so what the hell. Baby, don't even think of sitting there. You must be crawling with lice and crabs from that black girl and her filthy old men. What fucking lice? I told you I don't like coarse talk. Stop that fag stuff. You're a brute. I bet you stick your cock straight in. Machos are like that. We don't talk all the shit you do. If you don't want to talk, that's OK. But you're sleeping on the floor. See, I'm not missing anything. You've got too much. They're small, but original. No silicone. I got them with Medrone. Contraceptive pills that regulate menstruation on a basis of female hormones. What are you talking about? Nothing, nothing. What's your name, honey? Re'! - Re'! - You're fascinated, aren't you? I said you're fascinated, by me. Fascinated? Look into my eyes and you will feel the love that is born in me. Touch my hands, sense my perfume, and you will discover my love. My prince, tell me you like my eyes. Aren't they beautiful? Don't get mushy, man. Girl. Girl. I shouldn't have done that. Done what? Made you sleep on the floor. I'm used to it. Have some coffee. I'll clean it. It's perfect. Having a man in the house. Come over here to the light. - What for? - To delouse you. - I told you, I don't have any. - We'll see about that. Sit there. You've got a bump there, someone hit you hard. You smell really nice. What do you do, Reynaldito? Nothing. Does Magda keep you? No. I’ve got a job in the cemetery. But she gives you money. Otherwise you'd starve. Yeah, sure. Well, no one keeps me. I work very hard and when I have a man I'll treat him like a prince. Not like your filthy black girl. Hey, lay off! Stop talking about Magda, leave her alone. You're still defending her? She messed you up. It's odd, you don't have lice. We'll look for crabs. - Leave me alone. - No, I won't. Don't you see I'm very clean? Please, do it for me. Sit there, where there's some light. These shorts are a mess. I'll wash them later. Let's see... Look at what's happening here. It's scary! - I’m sorry, I can't help myself. - Go ahead. Don't touch my ass, I'm a man. All right, all right. You like it? I'm almost there. Yes, come on, come on. That's it! Come on, come on! Come on, pour it all over me. Go on. Give me all of it. It's delicious. Magda! Magda, something for you! What's wrong? Hey! Come here. You shoot your load and run off'? Leave it there, don't clean yourself. You've got the King of Havana's mark. You can get rewed up. Men, men! They're like animals. That's why I love them. Let me out. By day, I'm all yours. But only by day. By night, I'm a nocturnal butterfly, a messenger of love. Open the lock. Leave her. She doesn't love you. I'm not leaving Magda for a "princess" with a pair of balls. Who told you I want you as a husband? Your eyes. Don't get lost, idiot. Kid, come here! So you're back. That's what I say. I’m hungry- Too bad, there's nothing to eat. No food, no coffee, no cigarettes. Just rum. You're a disaster. You're a bigger one, Rey. If I didn't look for money, we'd die of hunger. Is that from the old men? From whatever, kid. Don't start that shit again. Go find something to eat. You go, and hurry up. You're a fucking layabout. The King of Havana, no. The Layabout of Havana! Hey! What? Do you love me, honey? Yes, baby. I fell into the web spun between Magda and Yunisleidi. Magda would disappear, I would disappear. We had no money, so we didn't even have shoes, or a radio, or a razor to shave with, or anything. We were poor in a poor county. We could only screw and eat from time to time. The poor man in a poor country can only wait for time to pass and his hour to come. And from you're born until you die, it's best not to look for problems. But at times they fall from the sky. For free. That's right, son. I sold everything, bit by bit, for rum and cigarettes. I even lost my house and I ended up living here with the dead. They all left me. My daughters, the grandchildren, my wife. They all left. - Where'd they go? - Away, son. Away. To where everyone goes. Why didn't you go? Look, I was born in Cuba and I'll die in Cuba. You have to forget your troubles. Yes, but I can't forget them. They've never written me a letter or called me on the phone, nothing. What did I do wrong? Drink rum? I like rum. What can I do? Anyway... From dust we come and to dust we will return. No. From shit we come and in shit we'll stay. Listen, you're a good person. You're my friend. What's the hug for? Why are you hugging me? Keep working hard and I'll pay more to you and to that useless layabout. Go on. Come on. That old man gives me the creeps. - He's just a poor man. - A poor man? Let's go find him. What for? He must be asleep by now. Let's go and you'll see. -L, I believe... I believe... - What do you believe? That he's got something and he's not sharing. He's got some deal going on. What deal can he have in a cemetery? Selling dead bodies? I know what I'm saying. Every evening it's the same. He doesn't want us to help him seal the vaults. You see? Hey, you old louse. Are you cutting me out of the deal? Get out, or I'll thump you. Give me my share or I'll go to the police. All right. All right. Take half of what's in that sack and that's it. Rey, they're selling chickens at the fair! What's wrong? No, no, get moving. Come on, let's go. ...and, wham! He hit him on the head with a shovel and killed him. That old man is one tough guy. I'm not working there anymore. Why? You'll get more money now. - That son of a bitch shares nothing. - True. And I'm sick of dead bodies. I told you, you're dragging dark deaths... Knock on wood! Don't remind me of those things. What are you going to live off'? The air? You. We'll find you a job. I'll take care of you. You always say that but you don't. You always disappear. You don't take care of me either. And you disappear too. Look, kid, when we can, we'll see each other and have fun, you know, -with no hassle. - No. I want you to be my wife, and to give you a big belly. Stop fucking around. I'm not giving birth to another loser. And don't be offended, but there are millions like you, millions. So don't think you're so great. Here, buy some beer. I'll get the chickens. Give me the doll! Give it to me! Look at that. Give me the doll, you miserable bastard. - At their age. - They're nuts. Give me the doll. Give me the doll. This world is shot to hell, gentlemen, shot to hell. That guy's Crazy- We're crazy, we haven't the strength to catch a bus. We get screwed instead of leaving. Shut your mouth. - How much are the wings? - Ten pesos. Shit, they're making millions and the government does nothing. Anything that was good is fucked up, you know that. Everything's against the people. Where are you going? I was here, I stepped out for a minute. - You're not going there. - Yes, I am. I'm too old to hustle. I'm fighting in this line of cows like you. I don't hustle and you're a bigger cow. You're the cow! Get out of there! Stop her, she stole a chicken! You're out of your mind. Give me that. For the saints. Do you love me, honey? Can't you see? No. Magda? You're back. I thought you'd bitten Snow White's apple. Who's Snow White? I never understand you. Because you're a brute. What's wrong with you? - I lost the job at the cemetery. - All the better. It was going to happen one day. Are you from Havana? Yeah. Really from Havana? A genuine Havana boy. Do you have an l.D. with a Havana address? Look, man, are you a cop or what? Honey, if you're Palestinian, I can't help you. Do you have it? Not here. Not here or anywhere. Go wash your face. José Linares Correa. 19 years old. Born in Sibaricú] and resident in Havana. Resident in Havana. Thank you. You're all set, come on. This Raulito is a magnate, he's got loads of people working for him in this bike-taxi business. And he rents out three apartments. He's into all kinds of scams. There he is. Raulito! This is the boy. Pleased to meet you. He can start today, can't he? No, wait, come here. Come here. Who the fuck is that? My husband. I can vouch for him. Do you want an advance? Of course I do. You'll give me 1,000 pesos now, and afterward 100 every day. If you like it, fine, if you don't, too bad. No. I'll give you 500 up front and then 80 every day. Don't try to rook me. You know it's not like that. Yes, it is. You can't fool me. I spoke to all your bike-taxi drivers and to the ones who work for Mari's Raulito, and it's 500 and 80. All right, puss. All right. It's done. So, the deal is you work at your own rhythm and you pay him 80 pesos every day and you pay me back the 500 advance bit by bit. Sweetie! Stop over there. And you're not to look at my friend's ass. Didn't we agree you'd be ready at 8:00, bitch! Yamilé, stop acting tough. I want you to meet Rey, my husband. This piece of crap? Don't be so vulgar. Baby, you're going backwards, like the crabs. Oh, God! Kid, hurry up or the whores will lock us out. Yeah, because you have be on top. You have to be on top, you have to be on top, you have to be on top, you have to be on top, and now I'm the King whether you like it or not. Yunis, what's the deal with this guy and you? Why are you with a deadbeat? Leave me alone, that's how I am. And the Italian? Weren't you going to Europe? Rey is for a husband. The Italian is for getting dollars. Poor thing. I can see you pregnant and stuck at home, cleaning shit. And with that gorilla crushing you. How lovely! Me as a housewife with someone to look after me. If God would be good and let me give birth... God gives bread to those with no teeth. I’ve had a coil anchored down below since I was 13. And I got pregnant three times. And, believe me, the abortion was worse than giving birth. That's strong. You don't waste time. No, that's for playing during the day. We need the hard stuff at night. Ladies and gentlemen, direct from the Caribbean for all of you... The Pepper Girls! Pure, ground pepper! H“ Pepper! The Pepper Girls! Yunis, look at what this savage is doing! You never pick one with a stringbean. Stop whoring with my husband, he's not like that. Let's see all of you. No! It's over, you're a pig. But with a huge rod. I don't like those. They give me pelvic inflammation. Give me your ass, I'm ready to shoot off. If you wash, I'll give you my cooch. If not, don't come near me. You can be sure he won't, sweetheart! I'm not sharing that cock. Put that away. Go down and wait for me with the bike-taxi because you'll get sick. ...your black girl! Where is he? Get into the room before I rip your head off! I'm sick of this! You nearly broke my nose! And you, faggot don't look at my husband again or I'll kill you! Who the fuck are you to cook for him? There's witchcraft in that food, it'll mess you up. Quit talking rubbish. You go on, I'll go in a while. No, right now! If you were even a rent boy and earned dollars, but no, cheap homo fucks with this slut. You're jealous because I'm a cabaret star. Jealous of you, fag? Go wash your paws and get out of my house. - Faggot! "No. not my wig! Fuck, the wig! Yunis, hit her hard! Yunis, hit her hard! That's it. Stay away from my husband or I'll kill you! Get off me! That's enough! Fucker, I'll kill you! Yamile, help me! Slut! I'll kill you! - Slut, animal. - I'll kill you. Faggot! Let go! Come back here and I'll cut you up! I'll carve your face if you go near my husband again. You can bet on that! Stay away from that faggot because I'll destroy both of you, even if they lock me up. I'll do what I want. You don't own me and you're not going to cut anyone. Fuck, I'm your wife! And you won't cheat on me in the next room! Because I fucking say so. You go off whoring for days at a time so don't give me the tragic housewife routine. Rey, I'm begging you, don't break up with me. I'm a brute but I really love you! Crocodile tears are no use. I'm going out, I’ve got work. Tomasa come to help. Tomasa goin' to talk fo' you. You born with great burden of heavy chain that come from far back. It not light. It a burden of heavy chain for whole life and it fall on you. That black bitch of yours no love you. You love, but she no. Since she born she draggin' blood and death and she goin' to drag you. And that whore next door, she need be careful. They goin' do something bad to her. There law comin' up and bars and jail there too. And that blind swallow, the darkness comin' for her. Yemayá and Ochún washin' their hands! Magda. Magda? - Rey, what happened to me? - I don't know. When you see me like this, it's old Tomasa. I can't do this every time she wants, it's going to kill me. She just comes to fuck things up and bring bad news. She never helps, she never gives me the lottery number. She just fucks things up. You hear me, Tomasa? You think you can come and get drunk at my expense? You know what you smoked? A Lancero Especial. That's a brand, that's money. Get the hell out of here, Tomasa. You're playing with Magda and that's playing with fire. Look what that witch did to me. She gave me a beating. Even my ovaries hurt. With that new husband, the wig that got tom, the make-up and that whore, you're kind of tragic. At least my teeth weren't broken. I don't know how you can do it. That isn't a woman, it's a boxer. You wanted me to take you, right? OK. But I want no more trouble with Magda. -I'll wait inside. - OK, check it out. Hold this for me, Rey. Wait here. Who was that? My Italian prince. He's crazy about me. He's taking me to his castle in Europe. What a creep! My husband's jealous. Give over. Oh, kid, I like you more every day. - I’ve got a bit of business for you. - No, no more. You have to earn your own money. You can't keep living off women. I'm not a loser. Of course not. Wait here. If I'm not back in 30 minutes, go on. Any chance of a job here? For you? I doubt it. There are lots of requirements. - This is a Dollar Area. - What's that? - Aren't you from here? - I think so. You think so? You just think? What are those requirements? You have to be a university graduate, a militant, under thirty and speak another language. Shit! And you're all that? Of course. I'm a civil engineer with seven years' experience. And I speak English and French. All that to stand at a door? I could do that. You haven't got a chance here. They won't even let you step inside. Go on. - Good evening. - Good evening. Come inside, please. - Where were you? - Around. Look, I need you to go to Trillo Park, to the "Cañón Musical". Ask for Daysi. Bring me what she gives you. 10 are for you. Shit! 10'? Is this dodgy? No. Handsome. Are you Daysi? Who's asking? Yunisleidi sent me. Hey, Elenita. What? Take him up to your mother. Mom, Yunis is looking for you. - Are those your chickens? - Yeah. Come on. - What are you doing with that? - She gave it to me. Don't you see she's an idiot! Give it to me. - What's this? Bicarbonate. Stop acting dumb and get out of here. Wait, don't shout at me. I can see you live off women but you're not taking one chicken from here. - Can I help you? - No, thanks. I’ve got a pushcart outside. It's cheap. The kids can sit on it too. I'm going to Cuba St. with Amistad. That's close. It's only 5 pesos. 5 pesos? All right. Don't wear yourself out. You all wail here, I'll carry the boxes out. My friend's watching the pushcart. Thank you! I didn't know what to do with all the kids. You can get on the pushcart too, and ride through Havana. My boxes! My boxes, my boxes! Thief! Those are my boxes! Hurry up, Doña Felisa. You're like a tortoise. Shit, Rey, I was asleep. Why would I want that rubbish? Have you looked at me? Dump that. Where did you get that? Never mind. Shit! We've got enough for two months. If you cook it. Don't wait for me to do it. Hey, girl... - What's wrong? - Let me sleep. You've always got a hard-on and I'm worn out. - From screwing those old pigs. - Give over. No, no. Look at how hard I am. - You want me to jerk off? - Yeah. Stick your finger up your ass, do what you want. You're mixed up in something odd and don't want me to know. - What am I mixed up in? - I don't know. But you're always disappearing. And not just for the old guys. Magda, I love you. I want to look after you. You know what's wrong? I think you got me pregnant. Me? Yes, you. You're the only husband I have and your cream comes up to my throat, so don't get smart. And those old guys? They don't get you pregnant, they've got no cream. It's yours. So don't back out. And help me, I'm not keeping this belly. Why not? Have a baby here? And both of us die of hunger? No, you've got enough with me. Magda, I'm sick of knocking around. I'd like to have a family with you. If I'd money and a house I'd marry you properly. What kind of family would we have? Ours, girl. Ours. HAPPY 1997 That's beautiful. Isn't it? Keep to the edge. I polished the floor with kerosene. I got some rice and beans. I haven't got an Italian castle but I'm not a deadbeat. Give it to your witch. You needn't bring anything here. What's that? For me? It's lovely, put it on me. You'll kill me. I'll cook something just for us. Would you like that? You live well, Yunis. You know how to live. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing? You have to get up early to put anything over on me. I can read you like a book and that black girl isn't making you happy. -L, on the other hand... - Stop talking about her! Why do you hate her? This is why. If I could, I'd cut them off. What I most want is a husband and a load of kids. And that slut, who can do it, is wasting her chance, and wasting you. A woman is a woman, no matter what. I can screw Magda 24 hours a day. Look, kid, I might be a fag, but you can trust me 20 times more than that whore. For 20 pesos, she'd jerk off the cop on the corner or inform on you and dump you. Take this. Tonight bring me five doses to the cabaret. Now what? Tell Yunisleidi that Reynaldo's here. OK, but wait over there. - Here, keep the necklace. - Why? The Italian wanted to throw it away. Hurry up, I'm peeing myself. Police! What's that? Good evening... Run, Rey, run! I surrender, I surrender. Oh, fuck! What happened? And that shit? Who's he? Cheo, my brother. Don't you remember him? Cheo, don't you remember? This is Reynaldito, he had that accident on the terrace, the police took him... Remember? Yeah, sure. Give me a beer. - Let's go, the party's over. - Hey, why the rush? My bike was stolen. Shit, the business didn't last long. Why are you laughing? You look pleased. - No, but I’ve got a better business. - No, no. Every day things get worse, I'm sick of it. It's a lot of money... Look, it's a party for foreigners. Two old men and two old women who want to see a sex show. They pay well. How much? Fifty dollars each. Wait here. What's his problem? - If he's no good, dump him. - No, he's perfect for this. He's got a huge cock with two pearls on the tip. OK, that's it. Hey, pass me that bag. Put this on. I'll find something for him. And clean him up. Hey! Don't mess me around, you're good at that. No, fair play all the time. Come on, Cheo! There are no women here. It's a nest of fags. So what? I’ve arranged it with them. You're not to touch my Mexicans. They're scared of diseases. The white guy is a foreigner. That's all I know. Come on. Magda, you provoke Rey. Rey, you take out that animal you have there and the two of you get sexed up. Then I take out mine too and you know the rest... What's the rest? I'm not getting sexed up with you. No, I stick it in Magda. She's your sister! Forget about that. I go in, I lower the light, I turn on a little spotlight, a bit of music, and then you two knock them out. You knock them out! Give me that bag. Everything OK? Enjoy yourselves. Stand close. Laugh. - What do I do? - Bark! Bravo, bravo! Excellent! Bravo! Very good. I pay, no problem. Magda? It's done. He'll pay another 50 if you go upstairs with him. OK. I'm leaving. There's funny business going on. Don't walk out now, It's another 50 dollars. Get to work. I'll make out with that fag downstairs. - With him? - Yeah. I don't know how you can. You've got some stomach. Hey, you'd screw anybody. Bed. There... You two. Magda. Drive him crazy. I won’t even need 15 minutes with this dummy. - Call me to take the money, OK? - Yes, Cheo. - You don't like this, do you? - No. My sister's always been red-hot. Don't worry about it. What happened? Hold on. Wait a minute. No, come here, my love. Look, we're going to talk, we're here to work, we're looking for money and we have to do everything. Don't get cocky. And everything will be just fine. Wait here, please. Keep going. Why do you want that? This little painting is worth a lot in dollars. It's for a foreign partner of mine. How much will you get? He said 200, but I'll push for 300. For that lousy painting? Yeah, right? I’ve got a head for business. I always mess up. You should hang out with foreign women. They're crazy about mulattoes, and what you have down there is gold. - Are you a fag or what? - I’m trying to help. Yeah, for free. Who are you trying to kid? Listen, let me explain. I’ve hooked up with a Norwegian. In February she's coming to marry me and I'm going to her country. Where is it? The back of beyond. Really cold, another language, but there's no way I'm coming back here. Good luck. Listen, I'm trying to help. She's coming with friends. I'll introduce you, we share the dollar business, you hook up with one and you get out too. It's not for me. I’ve never left Havana and I'm used to struggling. I'm staying here. You'll always be a loser here. Magda's taking too long. It was just a quick fuck. Come on. What's wrong? Nothing. He can't get it up. Oh, no? I'll sober him up. Hey, you owe me 50 dollars. Pay me and get dressed. Dollars. 50. This isn't a Red Cross post. I not. No sex. Don't make me get rough. Nothing sex, no "dinero". Pay me or I'll smash your head in. He tricked me. What did you do? You killed him! You think so? Do I think so? You killed him! No dickhead makes fun of me. What happened? Criminals! Scoundrels! Run, Rey! Run, the police'll be here. Come on, come on. I forgot the painting. You can't go back. Go out to the country until things calm down. And you? No, Reynaldo and I are staying. Take care, kid. You too. Don't do anything stupid. And forget about that deadbeat. If you're born a loser, you stay a loser. We can't go home. If they catch us, we go straight to the slammer. I know a place at the port. No, we'll go to Varadero and make money from the tourists. - Driver, what's the fare to Varadero? - Varadero? I don't go to the beach, only state taxis go there. But they're expensive. Yeah, it's robbery. Anyway you two wouldn't get in. - Why not? - Because you're Cuban. I'd have to leave you at the beach and you wouldn't be allowed logo any farther. Not that you look like you're on the game, but you know... Fucking country! You never listen to me. I lived in the containers at the port and it's quiet there. Nobody'll see us. And it won't be for long. - And what do we live on? - This. Where did you get that? Your brother had it. He was going to get 300 for it. - For this shit? - Yeah. Let's see, it says... Was-no. What does that say? I can't read. Everyone in Cuba can read. My teachers never taught me. Because you're dumb, thick as two short planks. Shit! Keep walking, don't look. Citizens, halt please. Good afternoon. Your l.D. ls anything wrong? - Let me check your bag. - But, why? Just let me check your bag. What's this? It's to decorate the house. - This ugly thing? - I don't think it's ugly. Your l.D., young man. Come on. I nearly wet myself with those cops. You with no l.D. and me with this. I don't know why Cheo stole this shit. - Hey! That's money! - That thing? All we'll get for that is a kick in the ass. We're going to live here? Like mice in a cave? Would you rather go to the slammer? I don't care. Inside or out, it's all fucked. Look, I can build a house here, out of wood. For the three of us. What three? You, me and the baby. You're crazy. Don't you see we'll starve to death? We'll sell poison for cockroaches. Oh, God! Where will you get the poison? This red water looks like poison. We'll put it in bottles. No one buys poison for cockroaches. Who worries about cockroaches? We'll get a saint and beg. Yeah! Two saints. One for you and one for me. Don't be stupid, Rey. - Where are you going? - Out of here. Don't follow me, I don't want a scene. Hey! Don't get tough with me, because I'll beat your face to a pulp and turn you in for killing the foreigner. I had nothing to do with that. Neither had I. Let's talk, Magda. No, no talking. This is over, Rey. You're a boat. A boat that's sinking. And I need a man. A man to help me and do something for me. - I can... - You fucking can't. You're a kid, a deadbeat and a faggot. Magda, listen. I can build a house for us. We'll have a nice life. I'll look alter you so that our baby is beautiful. I'll be a good father, a good husband. Please, stay tonight. Kid, I'm not made of stone! Magda! I built the house, but Magda still didn't appear and I never decided to look for her. Hunger was my constant companion. During those months I lived like stagnant water in a pond, evaporating in the midst of a disgusting putrification and disappearing. I was already dead then, like I'm still dead now... Why five? Why do a“ this work? To fight everyone and get screwed? In the end it's all the same shit. But I'm sorry! made a decision. Mention, a“ residents. Protect doors and windows. Stock up on provisions. El Niño will arrive In a few hours. Its effect may be devastating. Go to the CDR on your block. to find out where the shelters are. Who's the "niño"? Come on! Did you fall from the moon? El Niño is a cyclone. What's today? 2130. No, what date is it? It's a line for minced soya beans. Oh, yeah. That's right. Oh, love. Ha-ha-ha, why? Why are you asking the date? No reason. You're asking for no reason? Why the hurry? It's the 21st. What month? March. Thanks! Where are you going? To get matches. Remember me? - Yes! - Today's my birthday. Happy birthday to you! Give me a chicken. No. Go on. Elenita, what are you doing? My foot's sore. Come in. There's a great program on TV. - What is it? - The news. That's a drag. She won't come in and she didn't get matches. Don't argue with her. Elenita, you want me to come? No, no. Then shut up. Get the chicken. What chicken? Don't act dumb! You do it when it suits you. Get the chicken. - Where are you going with that? - Elenita! I'm sick of you two. Why did you give him the chicken? Bastard! Son of bitch! Thief! Stop him! He stole a chicken! Thief! Attention, attention. The electricity supply will be cut off shortly. The cyclone is arriving. Go to your homes or evacuation centers. This is a Civil Defense order. Attention, attention, all residents. And that chicken? It's my birthday. I came to celebrate with you. You left without saying goodbye. And you didn't come in months. It's yours, isn't it? Yes. He came out black as soot, just like his father. Did you lie to me? Yes. Where was he? In the country with my aunt. They said I was crazy, that the baby would starve, things like that. They came and took him. And the father? In jail. What'll you do with the baby? Give him back. I hadn't seen him in over a year. I built the house. If you want, he can come with us. You're crazy. I'm taking him to my mother. And our child? Is it gone? It's still in here. Are you coming with me? Come on, we'll see. What happened in Yunisleidi's place? They came and searched it. I hear that the fag's in prison. I hope he got 20 years. Why are you so nasty? Dead dogs don't bite. And her things? The fridge, the TV... She had loads of stuff. I don't know and I don't care. - Doesn't it smell odd? - Yes. Like rotten fruit. What's that smoke? What's happened? Hey, what's going on? Lightning hit the pipes at the electricity station. There's a leak of ammonia. There are people with asphyxia. This could explode. Oh, God. Rey, let's go. Don't stay here, move back. Move back. Rey. Come on! Kid, go back. You can't breathe here. You take him up. No, he's not mine. And I don't want your mother to see me. Just leave him at the door. Don't dare take the baby's money. Hold the chicken. Me? No. Any tears? - From your mother? - No. - The baby. - No, he was OK. Well, let's go. Come on. - Blessed St. Barbara! - What's wrong? I'm scared of lightning. Don't worry, love. We'll be OK. Rey... Why do you like me so much? Your tits and your ass are hard, you have a pretty face, wiry hair, and I love your kisses. Oh, Chango, come and see this. Let's go home, we'll drown here. OK, come on. Shut the balcony door. It's raining more in here than outside. It's not worth killing it. We can't roast it. Poor thing. Long live the chicken! Don't worry, baby. We don't have a piñata, but we'll celebrate. Come on, sit here. Look: Happy birthday, my King just for you. There's no pinata, no rum, no stew. Congratulations, congratulations, FUCK. my leg! Rey, hurry, hurry! Look, those two got out alive. - Where? - Over there, look! - Get in line! - Let go! Shit, I lost a box of peanuts and 50 pesos. We're lucky to be alive. - Does it hurt? - Yes. I bet you broke a bone. Look, there must be a doctor there. No, no doctors, no dentists, none of that. Don't be a moron. Come on! Excuse me. Ma'am, I'm busy. See to my husband. I can't do it now. He's all messed up. OK, let me see. He has a fracture, but it isn't inflamed. - Does it hurt? - Yes. I don't know what to say. You need an orthopedist. Let's go see him. This is just for emergencies. But this is an emergency. His leg is fucking broken, our house fell down... Control yourself and speak properly. He isn't bleeding heavily, he isn't dying, it's not an emergency. It isn't that I won't attend you. There is no or-tho-ped-ist! Get that into your head. Wait here. Yunis... Rey? No, no, love. I don't want you to see my eyes. Did they do it in prison? No, no. My Italian prince got me out. What happened? He took me to Italy but he dumped me right away. I was on the street... Whoring there was very strange. One day I woke up in the park. I felt the sun on my face but I couldn't see anything. Had they hit you? They drugged me and took out my eyes. - But, why? - To sell the retina. What's that? You're as dumb as ever. The retina is what goes in the pupils. They sell it at a high price to people who can pay. And the Italian? He wanted nothing more to do with me. If I got hold of him I'd take his eyes out with a knife. People over there are bigger bastards than we are. What happened the fag? She was blinded. He deserved it. I’ve always worn it. Oh, my Rey! Don't go. Come on. Rey... Rey... See? We even have light. This is your fantastic house? The wind destroyed it. Let go! - I can't take any more. - Because you're an asshole. You have to respect me. You? Why? I'm your fucking husband! You? You're a deadbeat, a useless moron. Waiting here for me, in your little fag house. Look where you brought me. I need a man. A man! Bastard! Well, bitch, am I a man or not? Tell me, you whore. Whore, yes, but with the man I like! You know why I disappeared? To be with my child's father. He looks after me, he gives me food, clothes, money. He's a real man. And I'll send him to kill you. And so you know, if I'm pregnant it's by him. I'm going to give him another baby. Make fun of someone else. No one makes fun of me, much less a whore like you. Now look what's happened to you. I'm the King of Havana. I have to be respected! That's how you have to be. Quiet. Not moving. Silent. Respecting your husband. I loved you. I wanted you just for me. But I never knew who you were with, what you were doing, where you were... Say something. Talk, say something. Move. Get my cream out! Move, fucking move! Your friends are here, Magdalena. Where will I put you? The vultures can't have you. The dead woman's body must be respected. And nothing more was ever heard of the King of Havana.
