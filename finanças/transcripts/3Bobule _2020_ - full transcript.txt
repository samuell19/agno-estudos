THE GRAPES 3 So, let's get to the finals. We have the last two prizes here. And coming to the stage is Tomas Vican. President of the Fest Wine competition. This year's white wine champion and second place overall goes to... The Michalica winery and their Welschriesling From the Stara Hora estate of the wine village of Bulhary. Owners Klara and Jan Adamek will now come up to take the prize. Congratulations. - Thanks. - Thank you. Hello and thank you, we really appreciate this. And as my father-in-law, Mr. Michalica, would say, "Man proposes but wine disposes." "Awards are dust collectors." My father-in-law's said that, too. Interestingly, I never saw a speck of dust on his own awards. And this one belongs to him most of all. Thanks. And now, the champion of the Fest Wine competition. It's a big surprise. The winner is The Karel Winery and their Palava wine! Congratulations! Our apologies... But the main prize has disappeared. What? - So that really was him... - What? Nothing. - Honza, Klara! Congratulations. - Thank you. - Honza. - Thanks. - Honza wanted first place. - No... Then you wouldn't have gotten anything. Klara... Congratulations, neighbor. No luck again, Mr. Kozderka? -It'll work out one day. - You bet it will. What time is the meeting with G6ttel? I'll go on my own if you want. So I could go home with the kids? Get some rest. I'll take the train. - He'll dig his heels in. - Nothing I can't handle. We can't lower the price, though. You understand that. And you've always bought it for this price, so... What was, was. There's plenty of less expensive wine on the market. Ours at least keeps the same level of quality. - And it will continue to do so. - I have my doubts about that. You know what I mean. - May I? - Please. This is a great wine from the Michalica winery, A Welschriesling, the winner of today's wine festival. It is a white wine With tones of peaches, peanuts, sweaty horse saddle. What are you doing, you jackass? You are aware that both jack and ass are synonyms for a male donkey? I am not at all familiar with Michalica, but everyone is saying it's a great wine. It smells wonderful. Like you do now. - Waiter, may I... - Yeah, yeah, yeah... - What kind of behavior is this? - I know, right? - They won't even let us talk in peace. - Just go away, please. Leave us alone, we're having a meeting. Sure thing, of course. Just remember: "For every mother's brother Michalica's like no other." - Has he legged it yet? - Catch him! - Yeah. - Of course. So what's your decision? either lower the price or there's nothing to discuss. - We'll manage without you. - Hang on now... - I guess he's gone, right? - Yeah. Are you crazy? You almost hit me! I'd never hit my best friend. Get in. - Why? - Come on! Hop in! I'm so glad to see you! Never rush a Riesling. They love a bit of botrytis. It's the only kind of mold we winemakers love. Don't worry about a lower crop yield. People will appreciate the Riesling all the more And smell the flowers, linden and honey in it. Where else would Praguers get that in the winter, huh? Don't try to change things. Listen to nature. Listen to nature! You just can't give it up, can you? - Do you hear me? - Yeah, that was just for you. I make an honest living nowadays. Investments, land worth several hundred thousand. - Right... - No, seriously. I even had my photo in a magazine. A shop lady recognized me and I got free chewing gum. It's great to be famous. Is it? Then enjoy it, buddy. It will start pissing you off soon enough. See ya. - Will we go somewhere else? - Why? There was a selection of berries here at first, But it's become more of a late harvest. - Good evening. - Good evening. - I'm just here... - Stealing. -Yeah. No, I... I've never done it before, trust me. You've been stealing it for at least half a year and selling it on. I just needed... - You have a family too. - You're fired. I'll give it all back. I'll work it off when the harvest comes. I worked for your dad for five years. He understood wine, people less so. Without him you won't last a year. Just look at yourself. All of Palava is laughing while you play wine grower. Poor thing. I won first prize. My friend here only got second. That's because he drinks beer, I couldn't do that. - Ever heard of balanced acidity? - What? - Acid? - How do you mean? Jirka, how did you make that Palava that won the prize? - What do you mean? - Your process and whatnot. My process? I planted it, harvested it and, poof, I had wine! - And how much sugar do you add? - Sugar? Two or three kilos of sugi, sugi, sugar... And she's fucked off. What? We should give it back. - Why? - Because you don't steal anymore. Let's go then. It's falling apart a little. - Are they only looking for their rooms? - Yes, a Czech is always a Czech. I'll fix it. - Watch it. -503... - There! -502. Are we driving on the surface of the Sun, or... Not yet, but soon we'll be driving on the surface of the Moon. - Where are we going? - To your place. Our place? You didn't even have enough money for the train. Thanks. - Have you even slept yet? - He who sleeps misses out on experiences. - We had to stop for Kuba. - For Kuba? Good day, sir. Are we not on informal terms? What are you playing? - Can I have a look? - Aren't you driving? Multitasking has never been a problem for me. I see. - What are you doing, Dad?! - Don't yell. Look, the most beautiful holiday of your life is about to begin. I seriously doubt that. Good morning. Morning. And again, congratulations. - Prizes aren't everything, Mr. Kozderka. - No, they're not. That's what I tell my wife. Quality is more important. Yeah. Exactly. How's the outlook for your wine, Klara? It's only wine when it flows. Oh, I know. Now they're only grapes, but yours are lovely! And you have so many. Do you want to sell me some? Your dad's gone and now you're all on your own. I'm definitely not all on my own. You don't have to tell me anything. I see how it is. - And when the baby's born... - Thanks for your concern. If you change your mind, then... Wine making isn't like making cheese or something... Although your cheese is excellent, in all honesty. - Have a nice day! - You too... ...Klara. So I was thinking... You know, when we were talking about your business last night... Well, buddy, you need to expand. What we need to do is keep our price up. Yeah, that too. But I know someone, who can lend us a helping hand. I can call him. Let me sleep. We'll talk later, okay? Sure. Alright. Hi Miro, I have a great offer for you. You're going to like it, it's the bomb. What are you talking about? There's nothing to worry about. A vineyard gives birth, when the vintner walks its earth. And when he speaks to it. When the leaves turn yellow-brown and the grapes get fat, There's nothing to wait for, Klara! So, Kuba, this is the land of wine and women. The first vineyards here were planted by the ancient Greeks. - Romans, man. - Right. And Uncle Honza was there, that's why he remembers. Do you remember the time we zoomed through here? We were young. Look, Jirka... I didn't want to talk about it yesterday... No... - You're dying! -What? - Are you dying? -Are you crazy? If you were dying, this is exactly how you'd talk. - But I'm not dying. -Then who is? - Nobody's dying. -Then it's fine. -It's just... Klara... - She's sick, isn't she? She's not sick. She's pregnant. Then you should be thrilled, that's fantastic! Because we only live together. We're not together now. The baby's not yours, huh? It is mine. - Then that's even worse. - What's worse? - Are you getting divorced? - I don't know. We've just stopped seeing eye to eye. Suddenly, we only talk about the technical stuff. Who will pick up the children, who will pay for what. And when her dad died it only got worse. Old Michalica died? You said nobody was dying! Like three months ago. Don't do this to me. You know I'm a sensitive soul. I'll step on the gas a little. This is a nice, straight stretch. - Why? Just drive normally. - I'm not going for bread rolls, am I? DRIVE SLOWLY. THERE ARE CHILDREN AND DRUNKS HERE! There's peace and quiet around here, Adelka. And people like each other. Just about everything gets sorted out amicably. And what doesn't, gets sorted out over wine in the evening. If anything goes wrong, though, just let me deal with it. There's no point pursuing the suspect in this case. We'll report him to the next patrol. For Christ's sake! Damn, little lady! And there goes my fucking bread roll! Hold on! Jirka! Where the hell is it? Right here, I got it. What are you doing? Those were cops. Somebody's tractor must be acting up. Let's see. Hi. Look who I brought. - Have you ever been happier? - Certainly not. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Thank you. Well? Get out. No way. You must be Kuba. - Welcome. -Hello. - Hi. -Hi, Dad. - What's up? - Say hello, you savages. - Hi. - Hi. I know you. From photos. You're grinning on all of them. - It is him. - This is Kuba, let him join the gang. - Hi. -What's up. - Come with me. Where are you going? Go make friends. Listen, do you guys play any games at least? - Listen, we do play some games. - Like hide-and-seek. - How many levels does that have? - In your case, one. Because we'll find you right away. This is going to be a blast. I'll let you do that. Thank you. So I told him we'd get by without him. - But he was our biggest customer. - And biggest jerk. - We can't just let him screw us, Klara. - Do you know what state we're in? And I caught Humpl stealing and had to fire him. So it was him? The thief, I told you so. Your father was a great winemaker but not a businessman. If you'd both listened to me we could have raised prices in time -and focus on other production methods. - You're always saying the same thing. - And focus on other production methods. - You're always saying the same thing. - Well, that makes two of us. - Oh, what's with you two? There's always a way. At worst, we'll drink it ourselves. Or at best? Sorry, phone call. It's Marie, I have to take this, OK? Hi, darling. How dare you kidnap my son! Kidnap? He's my boy too, right? - You don't pay anything for him. - Does that change his DNA? If he's not back by tomorrow, I'm telling my dad. Since you don't mind borrowing money from him. That was an investment that will make him a thousand times as much. You were always weak in the head but not even you can be this stupid! Tell me where you are right now! You just said I'm not stupid, so why would I tell you that? I didn't say you weren't stupid, I said you're not that stupid! You're right. Of course, darling! Sure thing! You're damn right I'm right! You're not right, not even a little. Are you on drugs, or what? No, my mind has never been so clear. - What are you talking about? - Kuba is staying here with me. - Absolutely not! - Hello? Hello! - I'm losing you... -What? - I can't hear you. Hello? Bring him back or I call the police and you'll never see him again! - Fuck. - All good? Yeah, that was just Marie. So, I was thinking... Do you want some help with the harvest? - If you're up to it. - You bet I am. - Every extra hand helps. - At least I'll get some sun. - And what about Kuba? - He'll be thrilled! - Really? - Yeah. - And where are you sleeping? - In grandpa's place out back. Stop by- Sleep well here. What harvest? I have to go to school. School can be really overrated. And it's not for another week. And this will be the real thing, the school of tough village life! - The boys in Prague will envy you. - Yeah, sure. So they're really staying. So there you go. It's good. Help will come in handy with the Humpl family gone. - At least the wine won't disappear. - I wouldn't say that. I went through the vineyard yesterday. Someone's been stealing grapes again. Just what we needed. - And do you know where the old press went? - No. Fuck! What? Will it run? No, it won't. It will never run again. For two years, I've been saying we need a new tractor. Nobody in this family ever listens to me. Hi, am I interrupting? I need help with something. Great. Careful, it's the David Copperfield of wine. What's this? Harvesting already? It's time for thinning. For the early varieties. Isn't it a bit too early? - It's the "acid reserve", Mr. Kozderka. - I see. I have an acid reserve waiting back home. Thanks a lot, uncle, you saved our harvest. The drought will do us in one day anyway, Klara. What about the drip irrigation they talk about? Better to pipe in water from the Thaya. Klara, I knew your dad all my life. Do you need help? You've already helped. Before he died, we spoke about me buying your oldest vineyard. Up there. To leave you some extra money. But there wasn't time. He wouldn't have sold it in the end anyway. - Thanks a lot. - Bye bye. It's so hot today that I'm wearing sandals without socks. I welcome you and thank you all for helping us for so many years. My dad spoke at the last harvest. You all knew him, so you know he was a better talker than I am. He understood wine better, too, but we try to follow in his footsteps and we believe this first year without his help Will be just as good as the previous ones. We're doing it for him, too, because for him... Wine was not a drink or a crop, but the meaning of life. As he said, "Water is full of vermin..." "Not so with wine." You take the whole bunch in your hand, And cut it up top. And put it carefully in the crate. And only cut these ripe ones. Not these St. Martins. OK? They're hard and sour. See? It's easiest job in the world. Ow! Fuck! I'm going to need a doctor. Rub grape juice on it, it stops the bleeding. What? Hey look, someone's been here already. Do you have any suspects? I might know of one, right, Klara? - But that's your job. - Look, we have a lot on us right now. To be honest, you're not the first or the only ones. A lot of vineyards have reported thefts this year, so... Do you have something? I don't have shit. I might know of someone else. Tell us. Remember, Kuba: men never cry. - Ow! - Hold on. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. That's all for today. We'll continue tomorrow. Children, come eat. Hang on, come give me a hand. - She said we're eating. - She said the children. Come on. Go, Roman, go! Get the lactate! Well, Mr. Kozderka? It's time to harvest, isn't it? Not at all, I'm just taking in the beauty. Now you're going to give me advice! I guess you've never seen more than a jug of wine? Here. Look. This is a fermentation tank. This is a cryomaceration tank. Come with me. - Do you have anything to eat in here? - We'll have a glass of wine. - But I'm starving. - Then have two. These are our new oak barrels. And here... ...these are acacia barrels. They make it zestier. They give the wine a vanilla undertone. - You have the best job in the world. - Right. - What about Marie? - What? - What? - What did you say? Marie. Is she coming too? No, she has a lot of work. We can enjoy it without her. I see that. Finish it. This is Sauvignon. It came out good. And she doesn't mind Kuba missing school? I missed school too and look where I got. Hello. Did I order something, or...? Officer Homolova, hi. I have a few questions for you. Inhale, exhale. Let's not be so heavy-handed, please. When was the last time you were at Michalica's vineyards? Last week, right before that... ...Klara fired me. Why? Grapes were stolen, there and elsewhere. Do you know anything about it? - Like that I stole them? - You left on bad terms. - Who knows how it really was. - What do you mean? The young lady probably didn't discuss their financial difficulties with you. And I wouldn't put my hand in the fire for her husband either, with his past. - What past? - You're the cop, aren't you? You can go out the way you came in. Good bye. Bye. I finally feel like a human being again. This is what I've been doing ever since I saw you last. I put the money from the sale of Grandpa's house into this. Wow! Do you have an alien in this cocoon? These are Qvevri. A 7,000-year-old Georgian wine making method. This is where I put the best grapes from the vineyard. And does it pay off? Not yet, but it's not about that right now. And what is it about? This is the very dawn of wine making. Back to the roots, you know? This is how they were doing it when people still used cuneiform. So the gentleman likes retro. But it probably won't save your winery, will it? Hang on a second... This might, though. Come on. THE MICHALICA WINERY 2013 STRAW WINE You animal, welcome! - Oh hi! - Hi. Hi, I've heard a lot about you. I wish I could say the same, but... This is Miro, who's helping us with the expansion to Slovakia. Business later. I've had your 2013 Straw Wine. Listen, really great, good work. Thanks. Like home. You see? When did you ever tell me about him, man? - In the car on the way from Prague. - I was asleep. -Oh please... - Miro? - Yeah? - Have you ever had Qervies? - Qvevri. Hello. Oh hello. Sorry, I'm Miro. - Klara. - Nice to meet you. I'm a friend of Honza and Mirek's. If I knew we're having guests, I would've prepared more than just cheese. It's OK, cheese is the brother of wine, there can be nothing better. - That's good, we make it here. - You don't say? -Just like the wine. Wine is for drinking, women for loving. - How do you know Jirka and Honza? - Jirka and I are business partners And I met Honza through him, but only briefly. - What brings you here? - I was just passing through and heard That the harvest had started, so I thought I could help. That's great, help is always welcome. I just don't know where to put you. I'll be happy to sleep in that shed. I'm the nature-loving type. Interesting. WANTED - What? - Nothing. Sleep. We should go do a night patrol of the vineyards. - Then let's go. - Now? It's only a frog. They're not scary, are they? - I wasn't afraid of it. - Yeah, we noticed. - Are you going out with us? - What? That's nothing for him. Sure. I'll go. - What do you want to do here? - What do you think? Seriously? Isn't that dangerous? - Crossing the street in Prague is worse. - For a redneck, maybe. If you climb it, we'll tell you a secret. No, seriously, I can't. I told you not to bring him. Let's go. Yay! A new record! How many times have you been to a harvest? Can I be honest? Neven - But what's influenced me most in life... - What? Green Veltliner. - Your friend is great. - Like straight out of a Soviet film. You've got to be kidding me. I don't get it. Did we not drive around here all night long? - Not even a mouse could have slipped past. - This was bigger than a mouse. You think you're the only ones who this is happening to? We'll handle it on our own. Thanks very much. We're sorry. - Happy picking... - See you. ...of what's left. Do you have to be so stern with them? - I'd bet those two have a hand in it. - Who? Are you mad? There's no money for pickers, to say nothing of security. We'll have to keep watch on our own. We'll split up, starting tonight. Who's going with me? - Well I guess I'll have to. - Oh... Me and Miro will do it next time then. Deal. Who wears the trousers in your family? Will we have a glass before the night watch? Sure. One glass never hurts. Will we take Miro? "Guest in house, stick in hand." That's not howl meant it. We should show Mr. Perfect how we drink here, right? - Careful, Miro is the king of parties. - I believe it. They say you hear the sound of music when he strips to the waist. - What kind of nonsense is that? - I didn't make it up. - That's bullshit. - Just look at him. Miro, will you have a glass with us after work? I will, gladly. As long as we don't overdo it. - You scared? - No. Come on then. It'll be a buttload of fun. - I didn't know you like me that way. -It's just something they say. Really? Where? In prison showers? I don't know that one either, I don't know these songs. We need some music. Hang on, I know what to do. Hang on, I know what to do. - Miro? - Yeah? Miro? Strip down to the waist! - What? - Strip! -Strip! They say it makes music. - Do it! - Strip! - I'm not going to strip. - Why not? - Come on, it's nothing. -It's nothing. - Look. - Me too. Like this. No image, no audio. Wait, you're going to go alone? - I'm not alone. - It could be dangerous. I'll go with you. - Thanks. - Sure thing. - So, are we friends now, too? - I'd say so. - Once again then, I'm Miro. - Klara. May I? - Thank you. - Let's go. Everything you see here is my dad's work. - You miss him? - Terribly. When he was here, he'd get on my nerves. Now that he'd gone, I miss him terribly. QUOTES ABOUT FATHERHOOD "When I was 20..." Same with me. When I was 20, I thought my dad was a complete idiot. When I was 30, I thought maybe he actually knows a thing or two. When I was 35, I realized he was a truly wise man. Now that I'm almost 40, I wish he was here to give me advice. That's exactly it. So listen, what's going to happen with your winery now? - Why do you ask? - Just wondering. Sorry, I don't know why I'd even try that on you. To tell you the truth, Jirka called me and asked me to come. He said Honza had some problems with your winery. I have some contacts in Slovakia, maybe I can give some advice, some help. How exactly do you want to help? By getting your wine out to more people. - That means? - If you sell me what you have barreled up, - I'll see to the rest. - We're not selling you our barrels. Dad said good wine belongs in bottles. He appreciated small buyers. Wait here. I'll handle it, OK? Well... He's gone, but at least I gave him a scare. - No climbing! - OK! - You're an angel, thank you. - Will you eat? - No. - I'm not surprised. I was just minding Miro. So he wouldn't get too drunk and... ...feel bad. You were successful. Actually, Miro was on night watch with me, so, mission accomplished. And how did it go? Good. There was someone there. Miro went after him But he didn't catch him. Miro went after him but didn't catch him. How strange. And I finally found out the real reason he's here. Don't go anywhere, sit down. You invited him. Yeah... I didn't know we'd arranged to do business with him. Nothing's arranged. As you know, we need sales. And he'll sell it in plastic bottles on the side of the road. - He said that? - Did you even talk to him? There hasn't really been time. He wants everything we have in the barrels. We'll have no idea what's happening with our wine. But the money really has run out. We'll be happy if we can pay the workers. If your dad was dealing with this... - Did he give you some kind of complex? - I'll just give you some space... He always considered me a Praguer. He liked you. Fine, but if it had been dealt with back then Then we wouldn't have this playboy here walking the vineyards with you. - At night. - You're jealous? - Yeah, I'm jealous. - Then you could have come with me. - Hi. - Hi. I hear you were so kind as to go with Klara on the night watch. You drank yourselves silly, what was I supposed to do? Yeah, well, I hope you didn't try anything on her. - And if I did? - If if's and and's... She's Honza's. - As far as I know, they're broken up. - They are and they aren't. They might be broken up now but they belong together. They're an inseparable duo, like Bonnie and Clyde, Or like us, Czechs and Slovaks. - If she falls for me, she gets a discount. - You can't do that. I'll just whip out Thai Freddy and she'll flare up like Notre Dame. - Not the Thailand thing, it always works. - Mind your own business! You just make sure the deal goes through. You owe me some money. And I don't want to hurt you. - We're friends. - No, we're not friends. If you don't get that deal, And I don't get rich off it, then you're done for. - That's not nearly enough money. -It's plenty. - No, it's not. -It's fine. This is what you'll tell them. What if I don't? Then Marie. - What about Marie? - She called me. - What did you tell her? - Nothing yet. So get moving. Go! Is the coast clear? Klara couldn't hear me anymore so she went to wash the dishes. I had a chat with Miro. And? He gave me a sample contract for you. We both agreed that your wine has tremendous potential. And an owner who is open to all opportunities. Seriously? You talked Klara into it? - That was sarcasm, you ninny. - Oh. Look, at the beauty here, Adelka. Now that's greenery. Just like they say: "The mountains are gorgeous, the sea is nice, but Palava heals!" Look, I've known these guys for ages, they're not involved in anything. Ever since the other one got here, there have been thefts in other vineyards. - Why steal from their own vineyards? - To cover their tracks. Look, there's young Adamkova. Hello, help! See how she waves to us? Hello! It's touching how much the people here love us. It's because we pretty much mind our own business. Will we go somewhere for lunch? We can't sell it to him for this price. He can go stuff it. Nope, you should have made a deal with Géttel. Right, so I do everything wrong. I thought having another baby would straighten things out between us. I thought you'd finally stop being so egocentric, so stubborn. - So the accusations are mounting. - Mom, Dad! -Not now, Anna. - But Jozka and Kuba... - What? Dad, I did it! Jesus, get down! CLIMBING SLANG We're scared! Both of us. Going up is easier. We'll go get them, won't we? Give me a rope. You go, OK? I'll tell you where. OK? Go on. Go. There's a good grip for two fingers on the right. That's it. And there's a foothold below on the left... that's it, great. What a comedian. Don't worry, we'll make it. We'll make it. OK? Good. There on the left. Yeah. What are you doing? I just wanted to show Kuba Palava. You can see this from Devicky Hill, too, and you can get there on foot. Well, are we going down? I'll go first. Don't worry, we can do it. OK, I've got you. I've got you, great. Dad's going to be proud of you. He doesn't look like it. I've got you... Good, put it down. Atta boy! Good work, buddy. What is it? Get up. - OK? - I'm fine. See, Honza? We did it! Great. Pomace, what a gem. If you let Traminer wine lie on it, That beautiful aroma of rose and tea gets into the wine, too. But don't rush it. It takes time. Thanks. - Good? - Very. Have a shot. Here. Here you are. Dammit. Mr. Rocer, I was just about to call you. When are you bringing me the great wine you raved about? - Soon, we're working on it. - Work harder. But... Hello? Hello! Dammit. Jirka? Jirka, come here. Come on, come on. Hi. Hi. How are we getting on? Fine, I think. We have them where we wanted them, right? Really? I think we haven't gotten anywhere. - How so? - I'm stuck here like a fool, Sleeping on straw, working my ass off. And I really don't like it. Honza will talk Klara into it soon, and that will be that. Really? It's happening today. We're signing it today. OK? I'll buy everything they have in the barrels. Now go see that clown and get him to talk to her. You raised the price per liter. - Thanks. - I'm a nice boy. An amendment? "The sellers agree that the purchaser may use the product however they see fit." What's this? What's it supposed to mean? What? I buy the wine, mix it with something cheap, and sell it. Palava has a good name, it sells itself. I just need a paper for it. I even have a name for it. Do you want to hear it? It's going to be called "Palavian Dream". Good, huh? - Honza will never sign that, though. - No? -No. - No? - No. -No. He'll sign this. He won't even see the other side, you'll make sure of that. Otherwise, I'll make sure you never see your boy again. Hey, buddy. - I was looking for you. - Well, you found me. What are you doing? Mixing the pomace? You remember, do you? Well, I listen to you. How's Klara? She's off somewhere with that horndog you dragged in. You know that's not a real animal? - That a horndog... - I know. Miro drew you up a new contract. He upped the price. Otherwise everything's the same. Will you give it to Klara? Why doesn't he give it to her himself? Doesn't he spend enough time with her? - I'm sorry. - Are you? It pisses me off! I'd be happy to kick his ass. But he's stronger. Klara still loves you. Thank you so much for everything you've done for us so far. We couldn't do it without you. We'll see you at the celebration tonight. I expect the other varieties to ripen next week. Thank you. Stop by for your money, so you can drink it. Make the kind of wine you'd like to drink. Think about it. And keep looking until you find something exceptional in it. And then again and again, every year. Klara? Klara. When do you want to start harvesting the Veltliner? Not for at least three weeks. There's not much anyway. Exactly. It could be the last harvest here. Then we could sell it, what do you think? That vineyard's 50 years old. Not even every other plant bears fruit. And we're not up to clearing it and planting a new one. You know that was Dad's first vineyard. He'd definitely understand. The worst thing is not even you believe I can do it. Where did you get that idea? I gave the workers the last of our money. If you don't want to sell it, Then Miro has an offer. A slightly better one. So once again, thank you! To a life like wine! - To wine! - To wine! I gave the contract to Klara. It's up to her now. Alright then. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - I'll tell Miro. - Thanks. I'll be right with you, OK? I'll come. - Klara has the contract. - Great. I'll sort the rest out with her. - Miro? - What? What? ls there a problem? You won't call her, will you? No, of course not. - Hello. - Hello. Any news on the thefts? Can we step aside? I do have some news, but I don't know if it relates to the thefts. - What do you mean? - I went through your background a bit. Yeah... That was a long time ago, the rashness of youth. And your friend is a real rascal, too. He did some stupid things, but he's honest now. I doubt that. Did you know he's under foreclosure? And that his ex-wife has reported him for kidnapping their son? - That must be some kind of mistake. - Unfortunately, no. You can't have come here to arrest him. Honestly, he doesn't strike me as someone who would steal grapes and kidnap kids. So talk to him and tell him to come see me, So I don't have to arrest him in front of his son. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Bye. - Will you have a glass at least? - No thanks, I don't drink. - But you're off duty. - Not even off duty. Take care. That's easy, isn't it? - Give it to me. - Go on then, slick. Not a chance. Forget about it, it's a Prague sport. Then stay here and I'll show you a Moravian sport. - Now that was awesome. - Wasn't it? Come on now, kids... Well, will we take him there? Keto diet. Not even garlic has enough garlic. And wine is bread. Come on, get a move on. What are you up to now, man? You kidnapped Kuba? And you're divorced? Is there somewhere quiet we can talk? Marie threatened me. She wanted to keep me from seeing Kuba. Well she'll be thrilled to let you see him now. It was spontaneous. You needed to get home after our party. I didn't think about it much. - For once, right? - And I don't regret it. I've screwed up lots of stuff, but I don't regret this. Well, try to set it to rights somehow. It's a huge fuck-up, man. I hear you're being foreclosed on, too. I don't want to talk about it now. I'm actually grateful to you, you saved us. You're grateful to me? Yeah, for bringing that jackass here. I think we'll end up selling him the wine. - What's that? - Quiet! Those thieves who steal our grapes. - I'll call the police. - No! We'll catch them ourselves, come on. The two of us? Will we go for a walk? Just a second while I catch my breath. Got you! - Anicka! - Theives! -Kuba! - You stole grapes all over Palava? - No, only here. And only me and Anicka. This is Kuba's first time. - We can explain it. - Nope, go home, now! The scoundrels! And yet so little that a frog could drink water out their asses, right? Honestly, Mr. Kozderka, I thought it was you the whole time. Me? Where did you get that idea? I have my principles. I never steal from neighbors. - And this is what? - Well... The last two rows are always in dispute. And those lovely grapes you had on the flatbed, they weren't yours. Hey, you want to say I can't grow nice grapes? Yeah. Well fine, I bought those. But not from your wife, she wouldn't sell. I wanted to finally have good wine. No one buys mine. I have a whole cellar full. Can you believe that? It's very nice here. If you're tired, we can sit for a while. - No, I'll be happy to walk. - OK, sure. - Miro is a bastard. - Tell me about it. No, seriously: He wants to seduce Klara, and says you're a redneck with crap wine. Our wine, crap? That's what makes you most mad? Shouldn't you reprioritize? No, hang on a second. - Hang on! - What? There's an amendment to the contract that you haven't read. Miro can mix your wine with any cheap swill he wants And sell it as "Palavian Dream". I helped him with the whole thing. Miro threatened to call Marie, and I owe him some money. For what? How much? A few hundred thousand. For the land. - Then sell the land and give it back. - They're not in demand right now. Then sell them cheap. - Where is the land? - There. -"There" where? Slovacko? - A little farther. Slovakia? A little higher. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. I'm dealing with all this because you bought land on the fucking Moon? - We'll work it all out. - What "we"? You'll work it out! It's your mess, you clean it up! - I thought we were friends! - That's why I told you everything. The water was rising, everything was on the line. Fred and I were supposed to go in, But then the Thai government decided to send local divers. - How often do you go off like that? - Whenever they call us. And can I be honest? Fred and I are really best friends. He's always been with me when worst comes to worst. This is Fred. Look. How beautiful. Lovely fur. You're beautiful. - What? - Does that usually work for you? - Excuse me? - You've got that story memorized. - Sorry, I don't know what you're on about. - No, I'm sorry. You're laughing at me? I'm working here and you're jerking me around? - What do you mean? - I'm here working on your harvest And you can't even tell me if we're signing the contract? - I've made my decision. - Really? - Good night. - Night night. - Good night, Honza. - Night. Where've you been? Walking. With Miro. - I noticed. Just like that? - Yes. And I signed his contract. What? I signed it, like you wanted. Then we're fucked. - What? - The bastard tricked us. I have a plan to fix it. That's it, boys. - Thanks. - Thank you. I'll say goodbye too. Thanks for everything. - And say hi to Fred. - Sure thing. Take it easy. Do you have a second? Hasn't he said anything? What can he say? The contract's signed, the deal's done. It seems kind of strange. - No. - No? Alright then. Shall we drink to the deal? I'll go for a bottle. You know what? Let's have some of this, OK? Honza, I heard you sold everything. Yeah, Mr. Kozderka, are you mad that it wasn't to you? It's a shame, but as they say: If not for human envy, there'd only be one man to a village. - Will you have some with us? - I'd love to. At least I'll get one last taste. Cheers! Amazing! Welschriesling. What I call Wonder Welsch. - Nice. - You're a lucky man. Mr. Kozderka, I've finally found you. We've got the thief, you can rest assured. Thank goodness, that vermin caused me millions in damages. You do have the largest vineyard around. Stop by to sign the report. - Do you want to taste anything else? - No, thanks. I want to thank you. You've got until the afternoon, as we agreed. Then I'll come for you and you'll keep your end of the bargain. Wow, Mr. Kozderka, hats off to you! - That was something, eh? - That is was. - But you were right, Honza. - About what? That it would work out one day. All my wine was sold! And he even liked it. I don't know if he liked it, but he took the bait nicely. No, I'm sorry, Mr. Kozderka, maybe he really did like it. And I know he didn't. What do you expect from a guy from Litvinov? I married into this. Now tell me why you stole the grapes when they're ours already? It wouldn't have been such an adventure otherwise. - So this is where it went. - So, this is lrsai. And our Mijller-Thurgau is fermenting here. Just don't tell your mom. Well, how is it? Nice. But not perfect yet. That means it will be perfect later. I'll be happy to help you with it. Just giving advice, of course. I'll stay out of it. What I can't figure out is, who was stealing from the other vineyards? We know. Really? Who? Remember what I said when you were little? That cars aren't for braking... - But for driving? - Yeah. Go on. - So who was it? - We told uncle Jirka. Again?! What the hell?! Am I alive? Dammit, am I still alive? What the...? - Well I'll be... -...damned. And buggered. Are you looking for someone? And how did you find out it was Humpl stealing it? We barged in on him doing the same thing. He got scared and ran, the coward. - You have three minutes. - Thank you. Adelka? That's how it's done, you see? The human approach. That's why people here like us so much. - Well, I don't like you much. - Shut up! So, I won't be seeing you for a while. You're going on vacation? Kind of. - Kuba... -I get it, you're going to jail for kidnapping me. - You knew? - Dad, I'm not stupid. And you didn't mind? It was nice, being here for a few days with you. - We enjoyed it, huh? - Yeah. If you want to make a run for it, I'll hold them off. - You'd do that for me? - I have your genes. Then don't use them too much. Or just the good ones, like the business ones. Maybe not them, either. It's time. You're coming too, young man. I know how you did that magic trick. Wow. And you really think it's worth that much money? Bad wine can't even be made in Palava. You'll see for yourself. This wine is a real treasure. To the taste of life and the beauty of women! What are you doing?! This is by Bandi! Listen, how much land did you buy, anyway? It doesn't matter, but imagine building a house, the absolute freedom, -no one around, and the view! - You're full of it, man. - No one around, and the view! - You're full of it, man. - Shut your gob, you. - You shut your gob! What? Here. On duty? What do you think? Klara, I know you're having problems with Honza but don't forget, marriage and relationships are like... ...wine making. Some years don't come out great, some are more acidic. Sometimes it seems so bad you'd rather just pour it out. But then it sits a while in coarse then fine lees, And it turns into something amazing. Something you wouldn't trade for anything in the world! - Ride carefully! - OK! What about us? Will we go to the press house? Not today. You think it's going to start? This car is like our love, Klara. It might take a while sometimes, but it always starts back up eventually. Where did you read that? Nowhere. Now go! Step on it! And the basis of both is love. You feel it deep in your soul. When you love someone or something, it's all worth the while. Even though it's crap sometimes, as I know myself. The important guy is the one who's name you bear. And since the wedding, that's not me anymore, but Honza. Hold onto him. Wine and life will reward you.
