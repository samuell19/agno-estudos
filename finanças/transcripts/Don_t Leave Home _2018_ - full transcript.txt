The Almighty does not touching us, from outer space. He breathe indoors. Our soul is a form of secret stay in our body. If the body is a shell of the soul. Then our soul is the majesty of the Almighty. So God is the earth. God is us. God is the end of our lives. Translated and Resynced by BernadX Jakarta, October 2018 Want to donate credit?

I thought you were making presentation of your artwork. At first. - Hey. - Hi. I had a strange dream last night. I think it's related to this work. It seems like something is missing. What? I do not know. Lost Souls in Ireland Of the many cases of missing people hit Ireland for the past 30 years, the most mysterious thing is the loss Siobhan Callahan is 8 years old along with her painting, painted by Pastor Alistair Burke in 1986. Even if there's nothing to blame, but because it feels haunted by this "demon miracle", Burke left his status as Pastor, and exiled since then. Looks like I can't finish presentation for my work. Looks like I'm running out of ideas. But I promise I will finish it today. What? What is wrong? OK. But don't be surprised to see this. - We will handle it. - Overcoming what? I have bad news. Don't be surprised. Honestly I was also surprised about this. What are you doing? They say they will change it review if there is an exhibition. If only I had your mold, they will review it correctly. And you know I won't agree with that. When did I say my work was finished? You said your hunch will succeed. I could change my mind every 5 minutes before the exhibition. I'm not finished yet complete the presentation of my work. And what do you care about me finish or not. if you think critics will read it or not. I will call them now. All will be fine. So this exhibition won't work. He's just a critic, Mel.

Do you obey Father Burke's request, not to tell anyone about your arrival? - Nobody knows I'm here. - Good. He is very careful about his confidentiality. He will be sad if there is one who knows his residence. He will continue to be disturbed. Yes. I can't imagine the life he lived. thanks. Should I wait Pastor Burke or Shelly, or ... OK. thanks. Did he bring ... Good. Sorry I'm not waiting. It is okay. You're right. I am the one who must apologize. Father Burke is not feeling well. - She is fine? - Of course. Just an ordinary stomach ache.

Very good, right? thanks. Can I hold it? Of course. This is yours. There are things that I feel lacking in this sculpture. - But I don't know what the shortcomings are. - Very mystical.

I think we are too cheap to pay you. - Of course not. Thank you for accepting me here. Your offer is on time. I feel honored to be accepted here. We are honored. Hi. Miss Thomas. Are you a Catholic? I was baptized. But I haven't been in mass for a long time. If you? I heard you left Pastor's status after ... Yes. Are you still a Catholic? I'm afraid to choose difficult choices. What choose? Painting or God. It's beautiful here. Is this where you settled after ... Yes, immediately after the incident. And when did you meet Shelly? Maybe after that. He wants to support me when no one wants to. Whether it's my family or my congregation. What about Padraig? He came with his talent. Maybe you have read a review about ... my show. I want you to know that ... I don't mean to make use of your story, or ... accuse you of being like that the critic accused me. Forgive me. I understand you feel strange about all this. This is also strange to me. I am curious, what makes you choose the theme of the person missing at your exhibition? Um ... maybe ... I heard their story, then I heard about your story. And when I started researching, I got news about the number the case of missing people in this area for the past 30 years. And I wonder why people are this suddenly disappeared without a trace. There is no explanation makes all that sense. Maybe this sounds crazy, but ... I suspect that all this is part of something ... bigger than that we understand now. And I think the best way to understanding the mystery is ... with carved dioramas which seems mystical. That is form extraordinary art. No doubt. Thank you again for held an auction event. How many collectors will be present? Excuse me. Sorry for bothering you, Miss Thomas. But I see the lights your room is still lit. I want to know if you are willing to meet tomorrow morning? Near the river. There is a personal thing that I am want to talk to you. Certain. OK. What time is it? After you wake up. But it's better before noon. Alright then. If you meet Shelly on the way to the forest, just say you want to go for a walk. We will talk next time. OK. Don't forget to wear a jacket. The rain will stop soon. But it's still wet. OK. Good night. Good night. Miss Thomas. - Good morning. - Good morning, too. How was your sleep? Um ... well. Are you afraid of water? Not. Miss Thomas. Just call me Melanie. Melanie. I want you to know I don't kidnap Siobhan Callahan. I know it. Even if I feel responsible for the incident. You pray in your room all night long right? It is true. But you have to understand about this feeling of guilt. I never said this before to someone else. The day I painted Siobhan, and when he posed like someone prayed, the light changes. It's like, holy light from heaven. The light is not long. But, I've never experienced it things like that before. That happened to me. What? I got the light. When? Yesterday when, I was in Maria's cave in the forest. Just like what you told me. Tell me. That light change, and ... suddenly I feel overwhelmed feelings that I can't explain. So great. That morning when Siobhan disappeared, I'm praying in church, and i got another vision. And at that time, I know bad things have happened. It wasn't me who made him disappear. You don't do the wrong thing. I've been hiding from community for 30 years, but I'm for 10 minutes for myself I can't. Good morning, Melanie. - A beautiful morning for boating. - Good morning. You do this again. Don't try you do this again. You surprised me. What did he tell you? Sorry? You don't listen to him. His mind was a bit disturbed. I mean is, he is seriously ill. We cannot lose the gift goes with him. What grace? You're here for a reason, my dear. Don't listen to him. I see you're working on something. This isn't finished yet. I know. This is a different challenge. You always like this when you want to finish. Sensitive and confused. Relax a little. You won't understand. Of course I won't understand what you feel. I'm not an artist. Finish tonight. Good morning, Melanie. - Good morning. - Did you sleep well last night? - Yes. - Good. I really appreciate your invitation here, and ... prepare the auction, but ... But I think I have to go home. Today. Is everything okay? Everything is fine, only I feel ... lose passion and me ... know that's not true. So I will sell results the sculpture I made here, but I can't attend at the auction. My dear, I understand your worries, but the problem is this is a special situation. the most important and interesting thing is, the collector wants to meet you directly. The artist. I understand. Honestly, I don't see it happened without your presence. If he wants to go home, leave it alone. Stay one more day, and you can go home to America. Your problem is there too not finished. After all, you already work hard for your work. And you agree that the exhibition will be held. Professionalism is a thing most important of all. I think you're right. I need to remind you if you are still want to go home now, we certainly won't ban you. You're right, I ... I've traveled a lot and I have committed. Yes, right. - We will make this night unforgettable with ... - Shelly! - Miss Thomas. - Hi. Is everything okay? About you and everything here ... Sorry, that's not my business.

Welcome this miracle, gentlemen. - Very beautiful - Extraordinary. Oh, my God... Is everything okay? The auction event starts! I'll give you another time. You can reply to me. But maybe not. This house. Did you see that? I can't bear it. It is difficult to understand human reason. You make me sick. How many times do I have to say ... This is a gift for you. But they are humans. You give them death. How do you know that? You know that. That's what they want. - That's what everyone wants. - What if they get lost? Don't you law yourself. You're a good person. You only need to rest. You're tired a few days. She's gone. We can get another victim. All will pass. Hello. Hey. - What are you doing? - Dispose of his belongings. Don't this one. But this is evidence. Nobody will find it. You are too familiar with it. Forgive me. Forgive me. I fool ... I fool myself. I am weak. I misunderstood all this time. Where are you? Is there ...
