I mean, I've been the invisible man for the last year. I mean, what? I've been kissing you, like, with one eye open. I'm always on auntie alert. This isn't a joke anymore. I am supposed to be starting medical school next month. Look at me. It's all been arranged. Oh, right. If it's all been arranged, you can't let mommy and daddy down now, can you? I mean, don't worry about me, Hashida. Jesus Christ, this relationship's shit. It's been nothing but absolu-- where are you going? Where are you going? Listen, baby. You're going to have to give up your art, like you've given up everything else for them. I mean, look at ya! I mean, look-- you've always been the perfect bloody daughter. Oh my God. Baby, I'm sorry.

There's Manju Sharma's daughters at the back. And also, Rekha Tendon, who's visiting from Bombay. Now Rekha's brother-in-law has kindly paid for our new roof, so please be nice to her. One more thing-- it is not often that we women get away from the patriarchal demands made on us in our daily lives, struggling between the double yoke of racism and sexism that we bear.

I told you from the beginning she was bad news. Scramble you up! Always [inaudible]. What next? Actually, what you said was, thank God she's not white. So what happened to the last piece of black solidarity, heh? Black don't mean not white anymore. Oh, so what does it mean now? Forget the melting pot and respect the differences. But that's was missing between us and them, respect. Chan over there. Him write him name on all them eggs like I thieved them or something. We all started from Africa. You remember that, all right, Chan? You'll remember next time. Buy you own fucking eggs. See What I mean? You try the fusion and you get confusion, and no bloody breakfast. Yeah. You're right.

No, it's not going to happen. OK, Dad? It's over. So what you're just going to leave her barefoot and pregnant? Is that how I brought you up? Jesus, Dad! I can't flippin' win, can I? Or is this something else you're going to leave half-finished? [sigh] Uh, look, is she all right? No. No, I don't think so. [music and chatter] [non-english singing] [bells] [coughing] [doorbell] Yes? - Mr. Chopra? - Yeah. You don't know me, but, uh, can you tell me where Hashida is please?

[music playing] You know, I've forgotten what my son's, um, voice sounds like. It just sneaked off, Manjit. There wasn't any, any discussion. No warning. She don't want to know. You can't change that. She still loves me, Manjit. Even if we find her, you can't make her come back. She's got the courts involved now, and there'll be a record of everything. What records? Is there a record of how she behaved? No, no, now come on Manjit. Listen, you were there and you saw it all. The shouting, the screaming, the-- I'm not the only one-- Yeah, I know what I was told, all right? This is so stupid, man. What are you going to do when you find her? You know there are other ways? You know what? Every time you open your mouth your wife jumps out. Get in that bloody car. [non-english singing] Come on. You used to sing so nicely at weddings. Not anymore.

Oh look. I'm OK. Look, go ahead, have something to eat. Yeah right. Look, Mommy! [laughter] How are you going to manage? I mean, bringing him up on your own. Look, I've managed so far. I'll be OK. Supposin' I put up and shut up? I'd been more popular. Yeah. It's just so hard to know what's right anymore. Look, you'll never please everyone, so you might as well please yourself. Hashida? If you can. Do you want to play? No, Hashida, you rest. You know? Rest? It's so lovely. This is nice to come out like this, isn't it? These people know how to enjoy themselves. Yeah, well as soon as we try and enjoy ourselves, people start to talk. What people start to talk? Let them let live. Look at poor Ginder. I hear her husband used to beat her. These modern girls can't adapt. And those with jobs are worst. Eh, Asha, wake up! You know her in-laws. Is it true? No, she must have done something. My own daughter-- the other day I was telling her that it's the woman who makes the family. You know what she did? The next day she shaved her head. [laughter] You think it's funny? I was teaching morals from back home. Home? What home? How long is it since you've been home? Look at you? Your clothes, the way that you think. Let go, Auntie-ji. You try and teach them something, but you've got to learn to listen. Your daughters are doing there best. Oh, come on. You're 20 years out of date. You want progress, like Hashida? She comes from a decent good family and still ends up pregnant. [inaudible] [non-english] What? 30 years I have lived in this country, never have I known anything like this. Auntie-ji? You wait till 9 months are over, and then see how many aunties you've got left. - You! - No, not me. Look, so what if she's pregnant? So what if the father's black? [gasps] - Black! This is the 20th century, you know? [non-english speech] That will kill your family, you know? It is not color, it is culture. WOMAN: For God's sake. And why a black boy? What's wrong with our men? What about the child? [non-english]. Listen to me, will you. Will you listen to me? Calm down. Calm down. She's going to have an abortion anyway, so what's the big deal? OK. Oh for fuck's sake. Let's just calm down, sisters, all right? You're not my fucking sisters. Now look what you've done! Hashida! Hashida, come back! Now look what you've done. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): 30 years I have lived in this country, never have I known anything like this. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Yeah, so what if she's pregnant. So what if the father's black? WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Black! It is not the color, it is culture. [multiple disembodied voices] WOMAN (VOICEOVER): And what about the child, [non-english]. [discordant sounds] Tell me, what should I do, [inaudible]? Tell me. Dear lady! Are you in distress? But I don't remember how I got here? I've been watching you for the last ten minutes. Couldn't decide whether you were wading or drowning? Oh no. My [inaudible], I'm losing everything today. Oh my dear, allow me. These feet are too delicate, too feminine to be wandering around unaided in this sandy wilderness. Thank you very much, but I must go. Go? Go where? What, like that? With bare feet? You know, I always start with the footwear when I'm creating a character. I'm on the short list for [inaudible] at the Christmas pantomime. Yes, yellow moccasins for her, I should think. So, why don't we go shopping? I don't feel so well, mister. Ambrose Waddington, actor, historian, and ancient Blackpudlian at your service. A friend of mine owns a jolly decent shoe shop. I'm not sure. Oh it would be an honor to accompany a beautiful lady around this fallen woman I call home. There. I'm going to go out with everybody's favor. It'll be all right, Hashida. Look, your mom and dead, they're dead nice. He'll come around. Everybody knows now. This really will kill them. Oh God. I want to die. I can't go back ever. What do you want to go back to Birmingham for anyway? It's the land that time forgot. [sniffling] Except all the dinosaurs are called aunties. Ha-ha. Oh, why can't Oliver be here? Can't you call him? I'm on my own now. [flush] I'm in control. Let's go outside. What is this? [shouting in background] [MUSIC - "I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR"] Just behave yourself! What are we doing? You're such a slag. - Buy you a drink, girls? - No, thank you. We're fine. Southern Comfort and orange, please. You said a pee break. We've been here half an hour-- I'm thinking. All right? Manjit, Manjit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, huh? OK? So where are you going? I'm going to find my wife. We're supposed to be home early, remember? But Manjit, this is where it starts. The one day, you'll realize that she's, she's changed everything that held you up, and then she doesn't need you anymore. And then, baby brother, you're going to want to kill her. Is that why she left? What the hell did you do? Manjit, what was I supposed to do? She's not coming home. No, but if I get Amrik she'll soon follow. Yes? Manjit, make the phone call. Tell them we'll find them. And tell your wife everything's fine. [bar chatter] And actually, U-2 are big influences. He's got more taste. Are they giving you trouble? And who are you? My bloody uncle? No, I'm your bloody cousin, actually. You two, piss off. [inaudible] And I still-- I've got to go. Hang on a minute. We'll come with you. What? We're going to babysit all day? You're about as much fun as a fart in a sari. Central Pier, an hour's time. OK. We're in luck, lads. I've just seen Rinku and Tinku you know, a couple of slappers from back home. Well, they must have come up on the trip. Come on, let's rock along. Oh it's Charles! My dear fellow, how nice to see you! Nice to see you! How long's the engagement for? 10 days, a fortnight. Oh that's nice. Hey, you want to be careful you don't get harpooned! How's the wife? She's in the other suit. Oh I see. You're in it together. - Yes. Can you skate? No, no I'm a shark. Oh hello, Sarah. I didn't see you. Hello, Ambrose. How nice to see you. So, you're going to [inaudible] I take it? Yes, just coming around. Oh nice. Well, we don't want to go off. Ha, no, that's the thing. Isn't it? You want to be freshly chilled I take you. [laughter] Absolutely gorgeous. Now move. Oh Asha, my dear. Oh you found a pair. Oh they're beautiful. May I introduce you to my very good friend Charles. He's going to be appearing in "Moby Dick on Ice." I personally think that-- how do you do-- I personally think you should be in "Jaws 3" Hello, Auntie Asha. Uh, Simi. How's Hashida? Can't seem to find her anywhere. Hopefully she'll turn up at Manhattan's. [non-english] I didn't mean to tell everyone like that. I expected more from you, Auntie. Why don't you talk to her later on, huh? You know, set an example. You're right. [inaudible] Ginder is over there. They still there? Yeah, this way. Come on. I was thinking maybe I could talk to your and Ranjit's. Just to help. Like you helped Hashida just now? Thanks, but no thanks. [non-english speech] No, Auntie, no. She wants me to have my hair done. She's trying, Ginder. I can't. Course you can, you deserve it. Look, do we have to go with her? Look , she's really sad. We can't just leave her. So? All right. This is it. Look, you can go now. I only said it to shut them up. Didn't think you'd actually do it. Look, it's OK. I'm just checking it out. What? So much for Dr. Hashida. What, I never wanted to be a fucking doctor anyway. All right. Besides, I've got nothing left to mess now, have I? Well don't do anything I wouldn't do. Come on, you. Look. I'll be all right. I'll catch you up later. Hashida. Go on. Madhu! [narrating race] [whistling] Really? [organ music] So beautiful, sea.

Lovely. Very nice. [non-english speech] A hot tea, please. [non-english speech] Doing everything. Hidingly, very clever. [non-english speech] This country has cost us our children. Excuse me, if it's a takeaway you want, the [inaudible] is around the corner. It's strictly English food in here. Understand? Bloody heathens. No manners. [non-english speech] No shame. They want to get back from where they come from. We should never have come to this country. They breed like rabbits. If the baby dies, it will be a blessing for everyone. [non english speech] Thank God I never had a daughter. What for? To curse me like this? Anything else? [non-english speech] You whore. Fuck you. [screams] You, Fuck off too. [non-english speech] Oh, I love the sea. The Lake District is better. You know, Ranjit used to whisk me off there on secret dates. That was before we were married. Never after. Yeah, well he doesn't sound much like the happy holiday-type to me. He could have been. Away from his family. That business. Maybe a few more days like this. Just Amrik, him and me. A couple of day trips wouldn't have made much difference. You knew that. That's why you got out. Isn't it? Or maybe that's enough to make him change? Maybe if I gave him another the chance. Can't see a bloody thing. I said, I can't see a bloody thing. Balbir, If you could, uh, focus you'd be more bloody helpful. I'll tell you what's wrong. Too much brain and not enough balls. That's your problem, man. Look at him. Ranjit, fills in the forms, and I drive the van. But he ain't nothing special Manjit, man. Is he, ay? Look at him. You're fancy cigarettes and your degree. They could keep it, could they. Hey drop it man. Manjit, leave it. I ain't the stupid one. I know what I am, and I know what to do, and after I've got a wife. [shouting] Hang on. Look down there. It's them. It's them-- it is? It is. Have you got Amrik? A-M-R-I-K. No, no. Sorry. Come on, girls. Oh uh. Take a photo [inaudible]? OK, go on then, yeah. On your own? Yeah? Come on then. Oh God. Stand up straight. Right. Give us a nice, a nice big smile. Here we go! [laughing] OK, OK [squealing] Put your leg down. Put your leg down. [squealing] Come on. [screaming] Stand up. That's it. No. No! Honestly. Quickly. Hold it. Oh shit. Big smile, look at the camera. Here you go. Here we go. Ah, here you go. Amrik? Have you seen a little boy in a green t-shirt? He's carrying a gorilla. Excuse me, have you seen a little boy in a green t-shirt? It's Daddy. My son. My baby, baby boy. No, it's OK. It's OK. Daddy has never hurt you, has he? Did you miss me? GINDER: Amrik! No, you're coming with me. OK? You're coming with now, OK? Daddy loves you, yes? GINDER: Amrik! I found him. Both of you. Do you want everyone to say I can't look after you? They can't take you away from me. What happened? GINDER: Nothing. Was anybody following me? Who? Are you all right? I should never have come out today. I should never have gone to you stupid refuge. I can't do what you think I should do. It's not me. Ginder, listen. I have to go back to him. I can't bear it anymore. Simi, Simi. She has gone mad. She attacked me. Then she smashed up the whole place. Then she tried to burn off my skin. Who? [non-english] Hashida. Oh, what is going on today? That whore and a half, in that cafe over there. Look at my clothes. Right? Everybody go to Manhattan's while I look for Hashida. Go on. What else can happen today? Why the fuck did I give up smoking? Your wife must be so lucky.
