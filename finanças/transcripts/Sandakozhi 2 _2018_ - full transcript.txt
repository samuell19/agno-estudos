Hey! Easy catch Go for it. Catch it... catch it. - Hey, come on... come on. - Bowl' What are you doing? - Have you called the chair contractor? - Yes, bro. - Ask him not to delay. - I'll take care, bro. Hey boys. 'Bowl' Take your stumps and leave. Why, bro? What is the matter? Do I have to explain to you? Arbitration meeting is being held for our temple festival here. Let's get organized before the VIPs come. Take it out - As you say, bro. Boys, what is happening? Panchayat meeting regarding the temple festival at Vettaikaruppu. Festival, huh? Wretched people! Wonder how many heads will roll! My family deity, save us. My heart is skipping many beats! Greetings. 'Hello... how are you?' Hey Muthu Listen to me. Why are you so adamant? You will behave yourself only when the right person comes along! Muthu, I'm going for an auspicious event. Don't worry. Hey Muruga! Sir has started Bring out the car fast. Welcome, sir. Please be seated, aiya. - How are you, aiya? - I am fine. Aiya is here. - Concerned people are yet to come. - That's right. We have waited for 7 long years. Won't we wait a little longer? Let them take their time. Karumaiyi anna, Panchayat has assembled The entire village is waiting for us. That's alright. 'The temple festival of Vettaikaruppu' '...is held in Theni, by 7 villages Mudur, Sembadhi, Arungulam' 'Thekkuru, Lakshmipuram, Mangalam and Kottaiyur' 'All these villagers unite to perform this important festival' '7 years ago' 'That temple festival began with revelry' Welcome welcome Hey newly married groom! Got married without inviting us? Karumaiyi, even you didn't inform us. We knew only this morning. Then how can you tell us? Please sit down. Hey, it's the turn of this village. Don't feel shy Take big mouthfuls. Why are you stingy with meat when you serve us? I am not being partial at all I've been noticing, you serve according to the face not the leaf! You should have been put in place Now you are asked to serve. Serve him all the mutton we have. Family of gluttons! Thekkur people wait for the festival to eat meat I think. So starved for food! Nitwit! What did you say? - Hey! Don't leave him. - How dare you! We can serve ample meat for 7 villages. Thekkur people, get up. 'An ordinary fight over meat' '...magnified into a world war!' Greetings, aiya. Tell that fellow to leave Or I'll kill him right here. Mind your words in front of our sir. He's letting his tongue run, aiya. People, get up - Sit down. Go back to enjoying the feast. You go. GO...! Why do we have this custom of community prayer? To foster unity and forge happiness, eh? Is it to fight? Aiya, why are you serving? Wait - Let me serve, aiya. Our children Our temple - I can serve them. - Aiya, please let me serve. 'As a revered village head, aiya solved the minor clash of words' 'People thought it was over but it wasn't amicably solved' Your tongues wag here and you bore the insults there. Who asked you to eat like gluttons? That mongrel should've been killed. Before the festival ends close his chapter. He deserves to have his throat slit, bro. 'Tell me if you can't I'll do the needful!' Are your people 'All words no action'? 'He should be pickled to pieces' 'Last day of the festival' 'Village deity was being taken on a procession, aiya also followed' Chop him to pieces! Let this be a lesson to everyone. Don't, I beg you. You deserve to die! 'Hey, Ponnuthayi!' Your son has been butchered. My dear son. 'Oh my god!' 'Aiyaiyo!' Look at this atrocity. They killed him brutally for such a petty issue. We must avenge this brutality! All words and no action, huh? Saw us in action? We squared the insult. You are the complete man! True lion. Pray our son to be born is a lion cub who takes after his father! Go to hell now! Brother-in-law! Aiyo... my child. My gawd! Pandi. Not a single soul can touch him. They killed my husband, right? His entire lineage should be destroyed. DO IT! Come on. Go and hack all of them. Come on, all of you. 'They went on a witch-hunt and killed every member of their clan' 'In the temple festival of Vettaikaruppu, in Theni district' '...the conflict between 2 sides resulted in a severe riot' '8 people have been reported dead' 'Even before aiya heard and returned to the festival...' 'Reserve police gathered round the temple' Thekkur villagers have infiltrated into the festival and are killing everyone. Come soon and save us. Pechi, we have killed everyone. Only 1 chap remains. We'll hunt him down and kill him too. Don't give me a count half way through. Finish once and for all. GO! 'Don't think we'll spare you' - Aiya... save me. - We'll kill you. - They killed everyone, aiya. - Hey! Stop. Please save me, aiya. Put your sickles down. Aiya, we respect you. But this sickle is unaware. Don't interfere. The goat can be terrified of a sickle. Will our guardian deity be scared? We have to seek revenge Kill him right away. 'My heart beats with every soul in this soil' I won't allow another soul to be killed. 'The festival which slayed my husband...' 'Till the last soul is wiped out from his assassin's clan' 'Pechi will not rest' 'Whenever the festival is held again' 'Pechi has vowed to kill him for sure' 'On the other hand aiya has sworn not a single soul will be killed' 'Embroiled in court cases, the festival has been stalled for 7 long years' 'People from the 7 villages have gathered to resume the temple festival now' Everyone has come, Pechi. They are waiting for us. Haven't we also waited for 7 long years? Can't they wait a little more? I've been waiting for this day too. 'Pechi... untie me, Pechi!' 'I won't rest until I kill him' 'Pechi' - 'Untie me, Pechi' - Won't you shut up? 'Untie me' 'Shut up' Even our vow has a leftover. Go. Uncle... let me also come. See if they fall in line with us. Or else dig all their graves and come. Don't relent. Aiya has been waiting. You take your own sweet time. Should all 6 villages wait here for you? If aiya has come now, should we have spread our mat last night and waited here? How can you be impertinent? Don't use aiya as an excuse to threaten us. Why are you shooting off your mouth? [raised voices] All of you, stop shouting. You fellows pipe down. All of us are well aware... Vettaikaruppan temple festival is the biggest festival in our district. Due to certain bitter events, 7 years ago such a splendid festival was stopped. We are unable to bury our differences till date. Let bygones be bygones. Now after wading through many court cases, our village head has finally... reached an amicable solution after meeting Govt officials. Let us forget the past. Let us strive towards celebrating our temple festival once more. On behalf of this Panchayat, I request total cooperation from one and all. Go ahead and conduct the festival Are we preventing you? We are waiting eagerly for it too. Even we have an unfulfilled vow. 'Heartless murderers' Mayilu, haven't you avenged 4 lives to 1? Why hasn't your fury subsided still? What? 4 to 1. Is our 1 equal to their 4? We won't stop till we wipe out 100%. Whoever interferes this time we will fulfil our vow! Will you wipe an entire lineage to avenge his death? Only now one of our clan members has become a collector. You are chasing him with a vengeance. Hey, you are fit only to dance to a woman's tune! Learn to think on your own instead. Bang on! We dance to our sister-in-law's tune I feel like chopping you right here [outburst of angry voices] A festival is not only to offer a feast to God and relish eating mutton! For the past 7 years without rain our land has been parched. I begged the concerned officers for an irrigation scheme for 52 villages. They pointed out we are incapable of holding a festival. And asked me how they can entrust us with a scheme worth 1.2 billion. Our festival has been stalled. People in these 7 villages have so many unfulfilled vows and donations. Inter-village marriages are clouded with animosity. How long will we continue like this? We have witnessed bloodshed. So this year we have to conduct our temple festival I have signed an affidavit in court. And discussed amicably with all the officials. Ask him for his opinion. What is your opinion? No change in our decision. We will do what we want to. Acting too big for your boots! We agree, go ahead and conduct the festival. If we recommence, then no one should be armed at the festival. No one should get drunk. Should not give shelter to wrongdoers. Inform the Panchayat leader if a stranger is spotted in our area. If you agree to these clauses... all of you should swear on milk which we hold scared. Hey Karumaiyi You come and swear too. 'Do you know what he has agreed to?' Promised on milk we hold sacred not to kill anyone or make trouble. Did we wait 7 years for this? To act is not just speaking words Showing it in action! What can Vettaikaruppan do? So what if he swore like that? Will we suffer a stroke? Or vomit blood and die. Whatever happens... actions speak louder than words! Though they conceded to your clauses their rage seems unabated. They will break their promise and come armed to the festival. To be safe, let's send Anbu out of town for 7 days till the festival is over. Is this how you speak, sporting such a huge moustache named after the braveheart Veerapandian? If they intend to kill, will we be silent spectators? They are the seeds of the family. Our life is mixed with the word we have given. We will stand united till the last drop of blood from our bloodline dries! I hope you trust me? He is alive all these days thanks only to you. You have brought up my son educated him and raised him so well I bow to whatever you decide, aiya. Till the festival is over let Anbu stay in our house. - We have to protect him. - 'Okay, aiya' - Thank you very much, aiya. - We are grateful to you. - Has he started? - Who, aiya? Of course he means his son, who else? Murugan has gone to the airport He should be here anytime now. Hey! Aiya is here Beat the drums. Increase your decibel level. Dance. Where is he? Nowhere to be seen? 'A handsome 6 footer...' - Why ask that fair lady? - Asking the plane conductor. 'He said he is coming in this flight, still missing' Wait, he will come. How can he go past us? Only our aiya is missing Everyone else has walked out. 'Did the plane leave him behind?' Move... move fast. Quick, move Make way for our car. - Go fast. - What are you waiting for? Go... go - Make it fast. 'Move... move' Big nuisance since morning, sir. Fireworks, folk dance, drums Going overboard on their revelry. Son of some village head is coming from abroad. Airport is a war zone! Sir, isn't that you on those boards? Is all this fanfare for you? Sorry, aiya, I spoke out of turn. No problem Focus on the road. They are waiting and you chose my car? You just said they are going overboard. Even I don't like this excess stuff That's why I got in here. Super, sir Very nice, sir. Can you switch off the AC and lower the glass? It is hot and dusty outside, sir. This is the heat and dust of my land I came to experience this after 7 years. Lower the glass. You respect our land so much. You have a way with words. Very nice, sir. Simple, sir I got into your car resenting all that fanfare. Kindly stop your shower of praise and drive properly. Okay, sir. Welcome, aiya. Aiya. Aiya, vanakkam. "He's a double edged sword who makes South Indians proud." "Even if he is dusky in complexion he's the classic tall, handsome man." "Hero full of mercy, he can't bear to see even a sparrow suffer however tiny." "Even if hindered by a waterfall cascading he will pitch in for his people, crusading." "Like a golden chariot is his stride And all the villages look wide-eyed." "Our motherland showers glory on this man who has created history." "He is the son born to victory who can defeat him in this century?" "Who can his vanquisher be?" "Who can cross swords with him easily?" Did you see my son? Has he changed? Isn't he still the same? We felt the same - Yes, aiya. Let's eat. Aiya has been waiting for you. Why are you standing apart? Let's eat together. Hello, aiya - Hello. They threw chairs aside when they argued loudly I thought you will trample him flat. Claiming to run a gym they are big bullies, aiya. Their beefed up bodies make them arrogant! I thought he will get it from you, but you let him off easy. Why gossip when we can enjoy our food? Isn't he back after a long time? Let him eat in peace. Go ahead - Okay, aiya. Who is that, uncle? You've just landed here. You'll know shortly. Er... it seems he yelled at my father in the Panchayat? - That's why. - Why do you want to buy trouble? We will handle it. Morons! What are you doing there? Aiya, everyone has come, including all the planes but your son is missing. He reached long ago. He has even finished his lunch! All of you come back home. "Chatter box, bold and brassy Grab the rooster, lassie." "Run, what the heck! Grab him by his neck." When I catch you... rascal! "Your rooster has a mind of his own On to the thatched roof he has flown." Hey! Wait Don't make me run. Hey! Dai! Stop. Hey! If you sit in that jeep you think I'll let you go scot-free? Minx! Will you come? Or shall I get you? What are you saying? Ssshhhh! I'll get you. "Chatter box, smart and sassy Go and grab the rooster, lassie." "Run, what the heck! Grab him by his neck." Whom are you acting smart with? I'll spank you. Scratched my hand... cha! Bro, hold this. - What? - Hold, I say. Give... aiyaiyo! Why did you let it fly? You know how tough it was. Butter fingers! Go and get him - Me...? Get down and go. Catch... yov! Get him now. - Yov! What are you doing? - You told me to catch it. Is this how you catch a rooster? Dodo! Can't I make out a scent hound by its face? Ther... ov... over there. Watch out. Clear off! Why did I ask you to help?! Aren't you going through Kariapatti? Yes I'm so out of breath I can't take even 1 step forward. Drop me there. Isn't this aiya's jeep? Why are you having a joy ride? Are you his new driver? Yes. Where is that fatso Murugan who looks like Ganesha? It's his day off I've saved you from hell. You'll be cooking in a pot by now. Your lifeline is long indeed. Yov! Why do you look at my face and drive? Eyes on the road I say. Why don't you play a song? Er... song... all that is- Swerve left please. Why? If that teacher sees me he'll dissect me! Were you his student? Thank God! If he taught me I would be a moron! Half his students are cowherds! That man is my father. He must be looking for me and this rooster! He'll keep showing grooms at the drop of a hat! Weekly twice In all shapes and sizes! Does he want to get you married? Looks like you'll ask me my entire history! Watch the road. Slow down near the tree I'll get down on the way. Right... right. Bye...! According to the 'flower-oracle' omen isn't good. Postpone it a bit. You want us to wait? We've waited for 7 years How much longer to wait? These aren't my words It's our deity's oracle. Whether the priest predicts or God wishes we must do the needful. How is your studies coming along, collector? Course is over, aiya I'm just worried about the result. Your brother Murugesan was my classmate. My brother has spoken a lot about you to me I hope all good? Why are you taking this route? Won't we reach our village if we go this way? We'll take the shortcut. Take a look, our dog has been barking nonstop. Aiya? Why have you parked here? What happened? No idea, it stopped here of its own accord. We will know only if I get down. - I won't spare you today. - Kill him - I'll make mincemeat out of you. - Hey! Stop. Move away. - I said, move. - What do you mean? You want me to keep quiet when he's right in front of me? Why is the goat tethered here? Why, do you know? That's the offering for the temple festival. You must pour turmeric water and slaughter it there. Not near a river or lake. Feed it. It will anyway be alive only for 2 more days. Bro, what's the matter? Why are you staring so blankly? Don't you recognize me? I am aiya's son. We are distant cousins, right? Did I get the relation mixed up? Won't you be hospitable to your guest? Give me some water. Engine is boiling That's why I asked. One of them spoke rudely to my father. Is he here? Not here, aiya. Here you go I'll be here from now on. Till the end of our temple festival. We can meet there. Ma, when will you tonsure my head? After I chop his head! Vettaikaruppu temple festival has recommenced after 7 years. "Vettaikaruppu, our village savior." "He is renowned as a brave warrior." "Spicy lamb shanks on the stove simmer." "To drink this soup, savor the flavor stomachs beat a tattoo louder by the hour." "Our village head's word we respect He's the lion of Madurai perfect." "Our blood flows with temerity truly If we revolt, villagers will endorse duly." "Born in this village hot and sunshiny People love to dance in harmony." "We will gather in the temple right royally Love as sacred ash we'll apply liberally." "If you swim in Mullai river you'll see how our hearts are filled with mercy." He's my friend, aiya. Is that so? Okay... okay. Carry on No need. "Our bravery can be won over easily by tender loving care generously." "In the village where our leader lives Wrap up enmity into your attic as archives." "Call your kith and kin Cook a feast fit for a king." "Youngsters come and make merry Pep up with your own brand of mimicry." We've arranged 5 vans for the out-of-towners to attend the festival. We cleaned the bushes behind the temple. Cater to all their needs. "Ace it." "Karuppa, our village deity Our precious divinity." "Karuppa, our clan's savior Our precious protector." "Karuppa, with good measure of temerity." "Karuppa's temerity spells terror in totality." "Girls from Vadipatti and Vadugapatti queue up, bedecked in gold and gaiety." "When girls flock, posters on the wall Banners welcome them, one and all." "Don't come in like a kissing cousin And play your pranks plenty within." "Keep your desires in check forever Greet the girls from outside with fervor." "The entire district of Theni houses people as sweet as honey." "If you do something fishy you'll be in a mess, machi." "Youngsters come and make merry Pep up with your own brand of mimicry." "Mikes and speakers fixed on the street Fun and frolic day and night as treat." "Our village head's word we respect He's the lion of Madurai perfect." Move on Check that jeep. Stop... stop. Yov! What's happening here? - What? - Aiya's jeep. Will you check even his vehicle? Sorry, madam Sorry, sir, you can go. If outsiders are assigned to duty here they have no idea which vehicle to check. Move... move. You saw the respect your sir commands. Why didn't you open your mouth and say you're his driver? Who can help you if you stare blankly like a child missing in a fair? We should use our offices when needed, understood? You've grown vertically but you don't know to prosper in life. Go... move on Gear up your attitude. Good afternoon, aiya. - 'Vanakkam', aiya. - Greetings, bro. Supervise the canopy being fixed. Rani, give a hand They are waiting. How long will you be stirring it? - Wait, Sembaruthi. - We have to go. 'Vanakkam' Get everything ready before my father arrives. - Sure, sir. - Attend to your work. Look at this! Our driver! If you need anything else, ask m- - You carry on - Okay, aiya. Yov! Come here. - Me? - Of course you, come here. - What is it? - Yov! What's happening here? I asked you to draw a small line You laid a whole long road! The build-up seems too much? What have you told them? Left, right, center, what improvement! You have people fawning all over you. At this rate, looks like you'll say you're our aiya's heir! All that's fine, it isn't enough if we make others run around. We should also exercise our limbs I have to take this cauldron to the temple Lend me a hand, to load it into the truck. Yov! What's up with you? Lend me a hand. Whom are you asking for help? Do you know who he is? Won't aiya's driver get his hands dirty? Driver, huh? He's aiya's- Muruga! Repeat what you said. How can you make aiya... er... aiya's driver lift this? Both drivers are hand in glove, huh? Going overboard on your bond, bro. We must work without discrimination in our temple festival. Understood? We are holding this conversation Why are you standing here gawking? Lift this - You don't I can do it. Why are you preventing him from helping? Is he such a big sho- No... no, it's okay I can load it for you. That's better! Both the drivers lend me a hand now. - Don't drop it on the ground. - I'll dump it on your head! Take that vessel and this bucket. Good... good. Right... start. Marimuthu anna, ask those boys to load the rest and bring it. Alright. Like a cool cucumber... she clicks her finger, ordering you around? And you're keeping quie- This way, aiya I know, come. Bro. In a mango grove. Her house Teacher's daughter. Only child. Stayed with her grandma and studied. Flunked the 1st time in the IPS exam. But struts around claiming to be a policewoman in her own right. She has come here only now. That's why she is blissfully ignorant about you. Why have you unearthed all these details about her? Someone doesn't know our background. We should know all about her, right? - What is her name? - Her name. You asked him why he found out about her and you want to know her name now! That girl's name is- He is the fellow who was rude to your father. Look at his temerity! Shouldn't let him go scot-free Must teach him a lesson. Your father stopped us 1 swift blow from you his ears should rip apart. Yes, aiya - Get into the jeep. Super, aiya. Muruga, get in. Long time since we witnessed a proper fight. Oh God! Aiya is here. They are waiting for you at the temple You're going this way. Actually- - Come, follow me - Okay. Hey! Look, Sembaruthi has started her dance. - Get a soda. - She is rocking, man! Master, why are you sitting here? - You're missing a bigger show. - What do you mean? Your daughter is dancing away to glory The entire village is enjoying it. Sembaruthi, your father is coming with a stick to bash you up. Escape... great escape! - Did you see Sembaruthi? - No, sir. You said she was dancing here. Where has she gone? We don't have any idea I blame her for befriending over-smart kids like you. Don't move My father will spot me. She was dancing here Where is she? Move left. Move to your right. Where did she vanish? I told you I don't know Why do you sound like a parrot? If I get hold of her I'll tear her to pieces. Anyway she has to come home. Master has gone. He has gone. 'Elusive as an eel!' I was looking for you What are you doing here? Aiya...? - What? - Nothing, vermillion. Stuck firmly to your back! Sembaruthi! - What? - You wanted to know her name. Sembaruthi! '2nd day of the festival' Check all the police jeeps near that arch. People from Mudur and Madampatti proceed towards our deity. - Ask them to get down from the wall. - Get down. Make way for those who have taken a sacred vow. Driver, stop for a minute. You came at the right time. This boy got lost in the festival. He's crying for his parents. Must hand him over to the police, let's go. Sembaruthi, your father is looking for a groom for you. You're standing here with a kid! I delivered him only yesterday Get lost, man. Where do they spring from! Now you know how their tongues wag. They won't let us be a Good Samaritan! Let's go, man - Okay, madam. By the way, I've been addressing you as 'driver' What's your name? Driver is good enough. Ladies, please take care of your jewellery. If there's any problem... please report to the Police Help Center. 'Vanakkam', sir. Yov! What's happening to our country?! Totally in form, eh? Each of them competing to greet you with respect! Come along. Come. This boy was crying lost in the crowd. Looks like his family missed out on him. Announce his details. Boy's name is Prabhu Father's name is Dhandapani. Mother's name is Amudha. 'The boy is wearing a red checked shirt' 'Boy's parents-' - You have a decided advantage. - Why...? If you get lost in a fair, you'll be easily found towering over everyone. Where did you go, my little prince? I've been looking for you all over the place. Aiya, thank you so much for finding our child for us. They brought him here. Thank them instead. Aiya, don't know who your parents are. Bless you both for returning my grandson. Before the next festival, you should also be blessed with a baby boy like him. And live happily. May you always be happy. (Song from 'Aadukalam') Icing on the cake a situation song as well! Hello - Huh...? Why are you laughing? I was amused by what that old lady said. - You are indeed unique! - Why...? Go, your owner may be waiting for you. Attend to your work. Alright. Go and educate your children. Some arbitration or the other every day. How strange!? Fireworks is only on the 4th day. But they've started today. - What's this? - True that. This is new First time. Seems a break from our custom. - What happened? - Don't know. Bring some water. Aiya, you carry on We'll take care. Let's go. Watch your step. Careful. Bring the car. "Good lord! Here comes the battle rooster." "His blows so strong and swift, I swear." "He can flatten any foe with just a look from head to toe." "He's a veteran with a sickle With any weapon he weaves a miracle." Greetings, aiya. Come, Anbu. Our village deity grant all our boons. Greetings, aiya. My dearest wish is to take a selfie with our junor aiya one day. (Song from 'Thiruvilaiyadal') Come, Anbu. Accept our sacred vow we offer with utmost devotion. What shall we play? Running and catching? No need, we might get lost. Then what other game shall we play? Good lord! Hey, look here. - Has junior aiya started his antics? - Let's go and check. You're falling like a chicken's crest I'll close his chapter today. You can wear a tiger mask in a temple festival. But you shouldn't masquerade in front of a tiger! My father strikes just like a tiger. But because this is a sacred event he chose to turn a blind eye! If you even think of attacking anyone here you've had it! Let's go. Aiya, that was so well done. We were waiting all these years to see you in action! No one saw you Let's walk away. - No evidence, right? - Not even a speck! If we walk together they will find out. Let's split up. Hey Muruga, come. See you later. Bro, excellent Give me your hand. Keep quiet. Muruga - Aiya. What did he say? What he said was. 'Do good in all ways Control your anger always' Tamil poetess Avvaiyar's words. Rewind it. Enough, stop. Play it. 'You can wear a tiger mask in a temple festival' 'But you shouldn't masquerade in front of a tiger!' 'My father strikes just like a tiger' 'But because this is a sacred event' '...he chose to turn a blind eye!' 'If you even think of attacking anyone here' '...you've had it!' Not making fun, That's how he talks. He imitates your voice too. Even if he went abroad... how can it miss the genes? A lion will always be a lion. Like a bull raging from an enclosed space look at his imposing figure! Like watching our evergreen hero MGR's film in a tent theater! Why did you stop with that? You'll say he stands tall like our deity connecting our earth and sky! Add that for effect too! Why bring out the beast in human beings? Allow humans to be just humane! - Where is my son? - Call junior aiya. Aiya, stop - What...? Our film is being watched inside. We thought we left no evidence behind. Like reality show Bigg Boss cameras have been fixed all over. Everyone is waiting for you Let's go inside. Hurry up. Why do you want to get involved in this? No, aiya. Suddenly they tied a towel round his neck and lifted him. Did you think we were just hanging around after the rituals? The moment we decided to hold the festival... that very same day we covered all the areas. We fixed cameras and appointed people. Do you know what happened when you butted in? Play it. Did you see that? Come here. We would have caught all of them. We would've known all the details of their accomplices, out-of-towners and the local hands involved. You barged in and messed it up I was just trying to be help- No need, don't interfere We can handle this. This is a long drawn out feud I'm hoping to end it at least this time, once for all I've taken a vow to put an end to this even if I sacrifice my life. As my son will you support me? Of course, aiya. "The sun and his son stride side by side." "To shine on the poor and the deprived." "They stand as identity to bravery and dignity." "Praised sky high is their generosity." "If their word, once they have uttered they'll forsake their lives, rest assured." "If father and son draw a line explicitly the entire village will obey implicitly." When aiya and son walk side by side they look like our village deity and our guardian deity. Isn't that only natural? What do you expect from his heir? "Clasp your hands and bow with love Forever and a day, not only for now." "The sun and his son stride side by side" 'Both the drivers lend me a hand now' 'If you get lost in a fair, you'll be easily found towering over everyone' "They stand as identity to bravery and dignity." "Praised sky high is their generosity." Hey Sembaruthi Come and join us. - Show off your steps! - Get lost. Okay, forget it Let's dance, boys. Come, bro Dance with us. Carry on, boys. 'Vanakkam' Your friends are living it up Aren't you joining them? At the moment I'm shell shocked! - Adding fuel! - Why...? What happened? Standing like a drenched chicken! Why did you lie to me saying you're the driver? Oh that! You asked, I answered. Why get upset for that? Big deal! What logic!! Do you know how many castles in the air I built?! A driver... will listen to me. He will be paid a salary every month. He will bargain and buy jasmine for my head. Watch a late night movie in Periyakulam. With the wind on my face watch the moon. Hugging you close on a bike. You know how far I travelled with you! Out of the blue I find out you're aiya's son, how will I feel? Feels like I went a couple of rounds on the giant wheel and got down dizzy. Now I know why men drown in alcohol when their love fails! I'm hopping mad now I might abuse you verbally. Don't show up before me for the next 2 days... go. Let me try to explai- You heard me? Just go away. Towering over me! Move aside. Hey, told you not to show up for the next couple of days. - Then why are you here? - I didn't come on my own. God brought us together. Listen. In a way it turned out well I lied to you I was a driver. If I had told you who I really was you wouldn't have flipped for me. Why...? Shouldn't aiya's son bargain and buy jasmine for you? Can't we catch a late night show in Periyakulam, riding a bike? Hey, do you know something? The other day that old lady adorned my forehead with 'kumkum' You know how long I made sure it wasn't erased? I'll travel any number of miles for you. I will do anything. "O' girl from Kambam village in Theni You slice me with your eyes splintery." "Like our gale spiralling dust all around you lift me high from the ground." "Hey! Leaf from the banyan tree Nestle in her dimple carefree." "Her plaits are like a snake twirling Wants to touch me, she is such a darling." "Wow! What a feeling!" "Like the colored coolers in the festival don't send me into a dizzy spell as well." "Don't untie the tethered goat, true blue making him graze in pastures green and new." "Get lost, girlie, I can't even think All night through I haven't slept a wink." "Kambam lassie." "Awesome missy." "O' girl from Kambam village in Theni You chop me with your eyes splintery." "Like our gale spiralling dust all around you lift me high from the ground." "Adolescent scent of your half sari Adds pep to my breath, dearie." "Words you spoke seemed so sugary." "You grind me into a 'chutney' Charm me and captivate me." "Lightning reflects in your eyes bright You flash in me electric waves of delight." "Like candy watch clinging to the wrist you hugged me tight, my dearest." "Like the stain from an ice Popsicle you stuck to my shirt inseparable." "Like a cup of black coffee you make my mind zippy." "Kambam cutie." "Blossoming beauty." "Like a giant wheel you take me high Make me swing right up to the sky" "I think, I swallow, I try to talk Words don't spill out, I simply gawk." "Your hands speak eloquently Your eyes invite me silently." "Like the 'jumki' in your ear you make my mind dangle, dear" "2 pink cotton candies you stole, honey Fashioned them as rosy cheeks satiny." "You got the winged termite's gossamer wing Stitched it on to my heart so endearing." "My darling, my life's meaning I whisper your name in the wind." "Kambam's treasure trove." "My one and only love." "O' girl from Kambam village in Theni You slice me with your eyes splintery." "Like our gale spiralling dust all around you lift me high from the ground." "Kambam cutie." "Soul-find sweetie." "Kambam lassie." "Awesome missy." - How was the exam? - Paper was very easy. Let's go up the giant wheel. It will give a sooper high. Hey! What happened? Get hold of him. Nab that kid Don't let him escape. Get that kid - What happened? There he is - Catch him. Aiya...? Let go of him. Remove your hand. Relax, don't worry. Enough I'm fine, aiya. How can he attack you? Aiya, we can't ignore this. We must do something. Whom do you want me to fight? He isn't even as tall as a machete! They've given a weapon to an innocent boy. Poison has seeped all the way down to the root. Even if 10 villages oppose us we can combat them. Do you want me to fight against a vulnerable lady and an innocent boy? They can come in any form. - We should only be very careful. - Okay, aiya. - Is it understood? - Sure, aiya. I slashed across his body I scarred him I scarred him for life, ma. He was standing, okay? One swift slash on his stomach. Look how he bled! Look, ma... blood! Saw my son's guts? Showed me blood. You men standing here. This small kid has drawn out blood. You made a big fuss saying there were too many people around. And you can't go near them. Do we have to wait for him to grow up to avenge his father's death? You sleep with your wife every night I am a lone woman. I have been waiting patiently 3 days since the festival started. Are you simply watching all the fun? That sound is continuously haunting me. Don't give me any excuse. He MUST die! Pechi, listen to- Pechi's word is final I don't need a back answer. Are you scared you swore on milk we consider sacred? Don't give me any flimsy reason. That's all I can say. Come. Hey, who is it? Is it raining? - Go and check. - Search every corner. Aiya - You study, my dear boy. I heard some sound. We'll take care You go to bed. Okay, aiya - Leave that behind. Shine the light. Take the light and search properly. Tell them to search around the house. - Did anyone get caught? - No one here. If anyone gets caught, I'll drill into your Adam's apple! How did you get here? I'm just unable to sleep. How are you able to sleep? You said you'll walk countless miles for me? But you're sleeping covered to your chin! Someone is coming Come this side. Come here. I can only see you wherever I turn! What...? Whispering romantically, right? Look at my eyes Can't you see? Can't you see your reflection there? Switch on all the lights. Leave no stone unturned. Come... come... this way. Go that side and check. How could you do this? Go home right now I was footloose and fancy-free What did you do to me? Who is it? If you get caught I'll string your intestines out. Road looks zig-zag to me! I'm standing alone and talking to myself! You said it's God's will and went away coolly - I'm the one who feels possessed. - Who is that intruder? Have you gone mad? You'll get caught. - Search all around the house. - 'We are on the job' 'Search in the backyard' 'There's no one this side' Go that side... go. Do you have so many servants at your beck and call? As if that math is important now. If they see you they will rip you apart I have taken a police training course I'll go in the blink of an eye. You broke in like a thief and call yourself a cop? 1st leave this place Go... go... now. Hurry up Didn't you hear me? Go...! Bye. Aren't we going to the temple? - Drive, I'll tell you. - Okay, aiya. By the way, who is that girl? Who, aiya? Which girl? You chaperone them in the festival all the time I am aware of everything. Tell me. Aiya saw action + romance, huh? Our teacher's daughter. Sembaruthi. Her house is in a mango grove. - Drive straight to her house. - What, aiya? I said drive straight to that girl's house. Okay, aiya. Aiya, look over there. The wheelie expert wheeling away to glory. That's the girl. Hold on tight. A feeling of flying in mid air, eh? Pull up to one side. - Saw how we lifted the bike! - Super, Sembaruthi. Why are you standing here? Problem with your jeep? Come, I'll drop you. But you'll ride only on 1 wheel! If you're riding pillion my 2 wheeler will behave itself! Dai, get down. Go home now Loitering around always. Okay, you go home. Aiya, you on a 2 wheeler? Hello... I definitely do a better job than you! Jack in the box! Aiya, to your house, right? Shall I take the short cut? - You take the straight route, dear. - Okay, aiya. Aiya, is this speed okay or should I go faster? Everything is fine, dear. Selvi akka, how are you? Not as if you didn't see me You bought flowers this morning. Did you see who is seated behind? Greetings, aiya. 'Vanakkam' Why are you announcing to the whole village? You riding pillion is rewriting history, aiya! Shouldn't I archive it? If I show off it adds to my value. Stop the bike near that tree, dear. Okay, aiya. Aiya found out everything. He's riding with that girl now. - Ask him to come soon. - I'm telling him. Are you really far away? I can't hear yo- Aiya? - How did you come in a jiffy? - Which way did they go? Via Nadupatti - Go fast. Go. Why did you ask me to stop here? - I came only to talk to you. - To me? If I had known I would've come myself. That's fine, dear 7 years ago... a girl walked into my son's life I don't know who jinxed it. We were not fortunate. After that... I requested him many times to find a suitable bride. He had no place in his heart for any other girl. He likes you very much. I approve totally I'm very happy. Hereafter you don't have to jump in through our tiled roof. You can walk in through the main door! I'll meet your father formally tomorrow. So you can marry my son, okay? You sprung this out of the blue How will my father believe me? I'll call him now Will you talk to him? Let him not believe you I'll surprise him Let it be a suspense. Where is aiya? What did he say? Tell me. Hey, I'm asking you What is that weird click? Tell me the conversation verbatim. Tomorrow - Tomorrow...? He'll pay a formal visit to meet my father. And ask for my hand in marriage to you. Karuppu, has aiya come for lunch? Not yet, he went- Aiya has gone out. Who is with him? Uncle has gone with him. Oh! Okay. They told me you were with my father but you are here? Aiya sent me to discuss about the chariot for the 4th day. All your replies differ! Nobody went with him? Don't know, bro. What is it? Where are you? Anbu has become a collector. He has got the official order I wanted to share this good news with his mother. She will feel happy to bless him, right? That's why I'm taking him there I called because I heard no one is with you. Why do I need someone with me? Anbu, careful! Aiya? Hello...? Aiya! Someone hit aiya's jeep and zipped away. Aiya, what happened? - Are you okay, aiya? - I'm fine. - What about you? - I'm fine too I am fine No need to be alarmed. - Get down slowly. - Nothing to worry 1st get that car - Wait. Hey, let go of him. Hey, come here. - Hope you aren't hurt. - This was just an accident. Don't magnify it Understood? - You're bleeding, on your forehead. - I'm fine, please go. Attend to your work. Go... let's go - Okay, aiya. They drove so rash and collided into aiya's jeep. Stop the jeep. You stay in here. Don't get down. You there Aiya's son? You seem to be going somewhere in a tearing hurry, come on. Let's play a small game before you go. Haven't you heard of eye for an eye? Come, let's settle accounts I'll hit you first today. Hey, hold him. Today is doomsday for all of you. By this time they would have killed Anbu over there. If your father had intervened he would be dead too. Your mother will be waiting You carry on. Tell her I need to arbitrate a pressing issue I'll attend to it and come. Didn't you hear me? Leave right away I won't desert you, aiya. I told you to go. - How can I leave you and go? - Drive away right now. Hey! All of you, run I slashed aiya by mistake. - Run for your life. - What have you done? 'Escape' "A lineage whose word is gospel." Aiya! Aiya... aiya! AIYA! "Stands now losing its magic spell." What happened, aiya? Dai, who did this? Dai, come on Face me now. Who hacked my father? "Aiya, our hearts skip a beat, fidgety." Don't do that. What is this, aiya? Only you should shoulder all the responsibilities hereafter. After seeing you bleed so much, how can I? There shouldn't be any problem. This festival... I've given my word I'll conduct it come what may. That drum beat which you hear in the distance don't stop it, my son. That drumbeat we can hear now should always resonate. My heartbeat echoes in the beat of those drums. Aiya... aiya. Nothing will happen to you, aiya. Bro, we got him. Will we let go of the hit and run driver? They are from Madras Drunk and driving. Must have done it unknowingly, let him go. How can you say it so easily? You should have seen aiya's forehead bleed I'm telling you, right? We don't need to rake up fresh problems, let him go. - Bro, I'll kill them. - Told you to let them go. Next 4 days of our festival is our only priority. Aiya has repeatedly said not to use weapons under any pretext. Throw down your weapons. Attend to the festival requirements. GO! We should comply with aiya's wishes. All of you, disperse. 'Thank your stars you escaped by the skin of your teeth!' Bloody drunkard! Who asked you to do this? What a catastrophe! Height of stupidity! Hey, you junk of a jerk! You've slashed aiya! Entire village will hound you. Have you gone mad? You've committed a blunder A grave blunder. It was a mistake, bro I'll stamp your Adam's apple. Show it in action, kill him. Whining since you got back! Why are all of you scared to death? This fear is the reason for not fulfilling my vow and killing by mistake. You are armed with machete and sticks, right? The issue is not how many of our men we will lose. It's about how many of their men die before he's killed! Dai, come here. Even if all of us die... to take revenge on those who killed his father, he needs to be alive. Come. Take him with you. How can you send your only son?! - How will he sleep without you? - Let them come. I don't care how many Let them come. Go fast. That's the house. None of them in that village should breathe, let's all leave. Who is shutting all the doors? Who is that? Open the door. Open the door. Is all this your doing? You're interfering in our plan 1st put the sickle down. What are you saying? They have tried to kill our aiya. Shouldn't we kill all of them? You are stopping us. No one should know aiya's present plight I've given my word to him the festival will go on. Who cares about the festival? Aiya is our God. He's the deity for our clan They have harmed him. You want us to keep quiet? Give us way - Stop it! We taught you to fight! Are you selling salt to the sea? Even if it's aiya's son who is interfering we care two hoots. We'll go ahead with our mission. Even if it's my own uncles who oppose. I won't care two hoots either! Have you already decided? - Let's fight it out. - Come... come on. Come... come Let's see who wins. This is why I objected. Did you listen to me? What I did was wrong Please get up. Must check his BP - Will do. What's that sound? It is another kind of treatment. What? You'll get 2 more patients in another 10 minutes. You go wait there. Go... go. - Did you get it? - Not a word! We shouldn't tell anyone an attempt was made on aiya's life. But the uncles have been thrashed brutally. Why can't we tell even that to anyone? Hey fool, it is his handiwork! Ask everyone in the house to assemble upstairs. Aiyaiyo... aiya! What happened to aiya? Brother...! Each and every soul here... for generations you have been working in this house. Your loyalty... the way you respect this family. I am fully aware. We haven't discriminated your secrets from ours. That's why I called all of you here. People outside shouldn't know something like this has happened to aiya. That's why he is being treated at home. When people saw a few drops of blood on his forehead they panicked. Now... if people get to know he was slashed we won't know how many villages will go up in flames or how many heads will roll. To douse the fire already burning... Aiya struggled this much. He shouldn't become an excuse. To start another feud! That drum beat will not be stopped. This is my promise to aiya. This is a sacred vow. For this festival to go on without a hitch this is our combined vow. This is like a penance. Through your body language and speech this news shouldn't leak out inadvertently. Routine work in this house should go on as usual. Don't stop anything because he's unconscious. Aiya is always there for us. He is fine. Very soon he'll come out of this. As his son, I believe this. You should also believe the same. If a thorn pierces a lion, it will hop for a couple of days. After that it will walk normally. Bro, the festival is being held as usual. There's no sign of that incident. What are you saying? Did you check properly? Yes, bro, I'm right here. Sister-in-law, it seems the festival is being held without any hitch. That's impossible I slashed him with this very same hand. The force with which I slashed him there's no way he can be alive! Please trust me. - Please sit down. - Is my daughter ready? She's been ready since morning and pacing up and down. If any groom came to see her she would be stuck inside the house. In fact she got ready by herself and is happily waiting. 'You look beautiful' My dear - Keep quiet. Are you sure he will come? Believing you, I've invited the entire village I'm really perturbed. What are you saying, pa? He gave his word, right? 'Let it be a suspense' How will he not come? Will he go back on his word? 'I can see their car' I told you, right? You wait here I'll go and receive them. - Wait... wait. - Please come soon. Aiya, I'm coming. Stop. Greetings, aiya. Welcome. Isn't aiya with you? Oh! Is he coming in another car? Welcome, please come in. My house isn't built for your height. Please adjust Bend a little. Please come in. - 'Vanakkam', aiya. - Greetings, aiya. Please sit. It's okay. What are you waiting for? Offer tea or coffee for our groom 1 minute. My aiya doesn't approve of this alliance I came to tell you in person. What do you mean? What are you saying? I invited the entire village trusting his word. Aiya, I thought you are a man of your word. But didn't expect these words from you! I'm an ordinary teacher. How will I face everyone? How can I digest this insult? You led us on and then let us down! Does your aiya disapprove? Or you don't approve of me either? Anything my aiya doesn't like... I won't approve either. 'How can you betray us?' My granddaughter can't bear this disgrace I knew this would happen. You've taught a lesson to me, the teacher! "Did you drink all the poison to save the world from destruction?" "Here is the blue necked lord O' Shiva, the fearsome God." "Did you think of it as a sacred offering? Was this sacrifice your way of suffering?" "Did you break the rage within? O' the lord in every being." "You saw Shakthi's eyes well up with tears? Is it due to your words so fierce?" Bro, how could you say something so hurtful? That girl's heart would have shattered into bits. How difficult my heart must have felt to say it? "You carried Himalayas as your burden." When it comes to public service... we have to sacrifice our personal needs. As far as the villagers are concerned they will only assume aiya didn't approve. No one will say aiya didn't come today. That's only important. "Here is the blue necked lord O' Shiva, the fearsome God." "Did you think of it as a sacred offering? Was this sacrifice your way of suffering?" "Did you break the rage within? O' the lord in every being." Grandma. Ask my father to fix any groom of his choice I'll marry him. - Dai, did you hear what she said? - This is enough' "The earth and the sky wrapped in laughter The whole universe happy ever after." "Cloaked in hypocrisy O' Shiva, tell me?" "Affection in one eye smothering Love in the other eye hovering." "Which tear drop bears defeat? O' Shiva, to you I entreat!" "This is a misty kind of cloudiness Did you get lost in its haziness?" "This disguise is a silent killer Why did you wear this attire?" "Is this strategy a solution? Is this the only option?" "Is darkness the harbinger of light?" "One with foresight who knows wrong from right." "Shiva! One who is omnipresent Is this situation permanent?" Muthu, don't throw a tantrum. Drink it up. Listn to me, drink. He refuses to eat ever since our aiya has been incapacitated. We can keep it a secret from people but can we fool this loyal animal? Tablets prescribed by the doctor alone won't make him recover. Drum beat of Vettaikaruppu has to be heard constantly. That resonance will cure him faster. Karuppu. Open the windows. We wanted to come yesterday but got held up. Eswari, bring that water and- Did you take both the notebooks? Good lord! Please come. What brings you here? Please come - Muruga. If you block the way how can we come in? - What is the matter? - We want to meet aiya. Aiya, huh? Junior aiya is free. Muruga, we have to discuss a very important issue. Have to meet only aiya. - Only aiya, huh? - Yes. Please sit down I'll go and inform him. Let's sit. - Bagyam, serve them buttermilk. - Okay, bro. They've made my head spin! Oblivious of the SOS crisis you're meddling with your laptop! Elders of Mudur and Panaiyur have come I believe they have to discuss something with aiya. - Did you offer them anything to drink? - Yes, buttermilk. Okay. Ask them to come in. Aiyaiyo! They want to meet AIYA! That's what I said Please show them in. Don't play the fool Then I'll bring them- Come... come. Come. [Song from 'En Annan'] Aiya, villagers from Mudur and Panaiyur have come to see you. They want to discuss something very important. Got the statement of accounts of the festival till date, aiya. We arranged everything for the chariot procession on the 5th day. Why are you standing so far away? Please come forward and speak. That's okay. Go on. You must request the collector to release the water from the dam for the 'sickle offering' ritual. We came to give the update. - Give it to aiya. - We'll take leave. We'll take leave, bro. It is all smooth sailing without any problems. Please eat lunch here and then leave. Aiya's orders. Aiya, we had buttermilk That's enough, we'll take leave. We are leading a good life thanks to aiya. - Hello... greetings. - You're also here, huh? - Is aiya in? - Just met him. Please go in. Aiya...! Aiya! Hey, Karuppu. - You're here, huh! - What is it? More people from more villages have come now to meet aiya. How will you manage this hurdle? Aiya is leaving for the festival. Get the vehicle ready. - Aiya...? - Go. 'When aiya is incapacitated how will he attend the festival?' Aiya is getting ready for the festival He will meet you at the venue. - Muruga, turn the car the other way. - Let us go. Is this a joke? How can he attend the festival? Wait and watch, he will. You go get ready I'm ready right now. All I have to do is sit and drive What about aiya? I'll be in the driver's seat. You'll be in aiya's seat! Er... hmmm. Please explain in a way it will make sense to me! You'll come disguised as aiya! - Did you see I'm already incoherent? - Why...? You imitate my father and me with ease Won't you behave like aiya? If I practice for 10 days, I can speak like aiya. But how can I step into his shoes now? There's difference between majesty and comedy. If you draw stripes on a cat, will it be a tiger? - Don't play the fool. - As aiya's son, won't you listen to me? Can aiya's son become a driver? How can a driver act like aiya? How can you compare a mountain and a molehill? Muruga...! Let me take aiya's blessing. Aiya, your son wants me to act like you. Please forgive me! Don't we disguise as God to fulfil a vow we make to our favorite deity? That's how I'm pretending to be you. With the grace of our village deity, Vettaikaruppa you should bless me with the required courage! Aiya! This permission will do. Enough, aiya. Muruga, start the car. - Aiyaiyo! - What...? I can't wear aiya's sandals. Try them on. Seems like 1 litmus test after another. - Shall I wear it on my hand? - Muruga...! Okay, don't be upset. - The vibration is ultimate. - Let's go. 'You said you'll walk by my side' 'But I didn't bargain for such a side show' "Sun with turban tied on his head Head of all the villages, most revered." Aiya has come All of you get into the cars. Are they all waiting here? Aiya, open the door fast Or else our ruse will go for a toss! Open the door. Load the baskets quickly. Make it fast. Hurry up. Thank God, somehow I managed to get into the car. We said we are coming to the temple I guess they don't trust us They are following us. - How many cars are following us? - 5 cars, aiya. Not 5 cars 5 villages! Aiya. We are following aiya's vehicle. We left from aiya's house. We will meet you at the temple. We are coming there Madampatti villagers also. Be there soon. 'Those who are watching the devotees walking on fire, keep to one side' 'A parking lot has been specifically assigned' 'Why are all the cars being allowed inside?' We have separate queues for men and women at the food donation counter. Look there, separate those 5 villages. Work has been allotted to all the 5 villages. What do you gain following me? Attend to your work. 'People from Kottaiyur, Mangalam Did you eat?' Kottaiyur people Aiya is mentioning you. Let's also go eat. Then it may get crowded. Those priests- Police... police...! "Silver moon that never wanes." Hey, police officer, how many people are standing on the steps? Children also, right? I'm speaking to you. Busy licking ice cream! Yov! Aiya - Where...? On the screen - Hey, get down. - Get down, I say. - You dropped the ice cream I know it's a hot day Enjoy the ice cream and then work. The electricians fixing the serial lights Don't hinder the chariot procession. Position it to one side. Understood? Bro, nothing has happened to aiya! He has come to the festival. Speaking in his usual energetic voice. We are watching on the screen. 'Drink coffee' 'Tell me, aiya' Next is a commercial break! "Who is the winner now and forever Lungis with the brand MCR." That's true. You made me dress up like aiya I thought it'll be a herculean task But it was a cakewalk! Showed aiya on the screen and we escaped! You spoke very well. 'Listen to me' From morning, you're hell bent on falling under every car passing by. Aiya, looks like trouble is brewing. - This chap, huh? - Whatever it is I'll ask only aiya. Get lost, man I know it's aiya's vehicle. Why has he brought so many people? What is his plan? I must meet Aiya I must look him in his eye and question him. This is my plea. If you stop me... I'll break it and pierce myself. - Let go of me. - Drunkard, move aside I'll break it and pierce myself. Aiya - What is it? He isn't yielding. He's obstinate he has to meet aiya in person. Ask him to come over. He wants to meet our aiya What are you saying? Aren't you aiya? Hey, aiya is calling you. If he comes here we'll get caught. He's here! Let go of me - Please don't. 'Open the door' - Don't open. Look at me, aiya. 'Please turn' 'Look at me, aiya' Wait... wait. - This isn't our aiya! - I told you, right? What is he blabbering? You are... my God! The God I can see face to face! Because of drinking this cursed liquor... I lost my eyesight. I can't see your face clearly. Please help me with money for my eye surgery. When should I come? Don't worry. Let the festival get over I'll ask Murugan to organize it, okay? Murugan? He's a rascal. He's a fraud! He's an actor. Past 3 days I've been trying to see you. He didn't allow me to meet you. He's complaining about me to me! You rascal! I'll inform my son and arrange everything. Aiya, if you are God in person he's the younger version of the same! May both of you lead a long and healthy life. Convey my regards to your son. Give way. Move away Make way for sir's car. Come, God Move aside. 'Pechi, there's no sign indicating the incident ever happened!' 'It is a big question mark if aiya is alive or not' What do we do now? Who should we send to find out? Hey, will you go? Dai, what about you? Hey old lady, will you check and come? 1st you should be hacked! You're the reason for all the troubles. No need of any research whether he's alive or dead. Our target is still alive!! Pechi, please untie my chains I'll make sure I kill him. Pechi...! Hello, tell me, uncle. Is Anbu with you? What are you saying? He's with aiya. Can't find him here. When did you check? Did you see properly? Bro, we searched for him everywhere We assumed he's with you I even tried calling him but he isn't picking up the call. All this happened only because of me, aiya. When you asked me to leave, I shouldn't have left. If I die, all the problems will be solved, right? Bro, the bull is falling into our trap of its own accord, please come fast. Move the car. - Ma? - Tell me. How are you? I felt like talking to you That's why I called I can't hear you clearly. You sound very dull. It's very noisy here I'll call you later. Okay, take care of your health. What, my dear boys? You wanted to kidnap him? Wondering how he pre-empted you? You looked at the sheep in front. But you didn't notice the tiger at the back. Look there. This isn't a 'Goat vs Tiger' game. This is a goat and tiger playing games together. You are educated. You've taken the right decision! Very correct. I can't bear to see aiya in this condition. I am to blame for all this. If I die, won't everything be fine? Has your life become so simple for you? Your life isn't just yours alone. Behind that is your entire lineage. Following my aiya's words that he'll protect you... is our entire lineage too! Believing I'll safeguard you... our aiya is still breathing. Tomorrow when he opens his eyes... if I say Anbu is missing. And the festival was stopped half way through he'll look at me with so much pride you know! Aiya...! I know it's wrong. Tomorrow is the 6th day of our temple festival. You will be offering our sickle to our village deity I've got permission from all the 6 villages. And you feel this way at this juncture! Don't cry. - Don't repeat this mistake again. - I won't, aiya. Nothing to worry, grandma. It's a real big bruise and you're brushing it aside. If you ride with a wandering mind this will be the end result! Groom and his family are coming to see you. If you're injured now, won't they take it as inauspicious? Wonder where she fell! The wire has come apart. Brake doesn't work and mirror is broken! Let her touch this bike again I will clobber her. Why have they come here? What brings you here? What do you want? I'm applying this ointment Where are you rushing off to? Always playful! I heard Sembaruthi is hurt I came to see her. You already hit us very heavily We are yet to recover! How can it get worse? A prospective groom is coming to see my daughter today. They have a lot of self-respect. They will be punctual and keep up their word. Unlike you! Kindly leave this place. Alright. When you have an auspicious event to look forward to and I'm a hindrance we'll leave. Thank you very much! Please get going. For any happy occasion in the neighborhood... aiya sends a trousseau It will be delivered at your doorstep. We don't need any favors from you. We can fend for ourselves. We will be fine without you in our lives. You've done enough damage. You ruined everything by not coming Today don't spoil it by coming! Go away...! Are you mad or wha- We are at the receiving end. So can he let his tongue ru- We will thank you profusely. Leave now - You won't prosper. Hypocrites! If the bike is so badly damaged imagine that poor girl's condition. If the teacher is in a rage, you're adding fuel to the fire 1st I should buy a dog for this house. Not just buy. Tie it at the gate. Sembaruthi. Get ready soon. The groom and his family will be here anytime. Bro, how do we go to the teacher's house? Why are you going there? To see the prospective bride. Wait a minute I'll deal with them. Who is the groom? This chap, huh? What...? He hid his eyes. Will you tell us how to go only if you know who the groom is? If you just say teacher, how can we guide you? We'll know only if you say music teacher, stunt master. He said even a kid will direct us to his place. Then go ask a kid! Why do you ask me? Bro, why are you so rude? It's a matter of my life! - Is your life at stake? - Yes. If you take this right and then left you'll reach your destination! Giving directions to the cemetery! Cemetery? He looks like he has already been cremated! So I told him the way to the cemetery. If you go straight and take a right... you'll see a mango grove Their house is in the center. Go fast, bride will be yearning for me. All arrangements are in proper order. Where's your aiya? Is he at home? I've come to see him. The groom came to 'see' me. He liked me instantly. We finalized it formally. You must have thought we won't get anyone else. So I came here to tell you 1st invitation will be only for you. You come from an affluent family. We can't trust you. You'll post the photos we clicked and selfies in Twitter and Facebook. And try to break up this alliance So I came to collect everything. We have no ties hereafter. Enough is enough. Let's wrap up everything. Where's your aiya? The most respected man! Your suspense turned out to be a shock. Did you run and hide hearing my voice? I'm coming. You sent your son as a messenger. She has gone right in What should we do now? I've come in person Tell me now. Let her go - What...? If it hasn't rained the past 7 years how will it rain when you're here? You call yourself a big shot and break your promise! One who changes his mind isn't a big shot. To keep up your word, you should be prepared to sacrifice your lif- 'I'll surprise him Let it be a suspense' 'Anything my aiya doesn't like...' '...I won't approve either' I saw aiya. Why did you hide it from me? When I was slightly hurt, you came running to see me. He has such a huge bandage on- I derided you saying 'how will it rain with you being here' You've shed blood for this land. You hid everything from me. How can you behave as if nothing happened? Sacred vow. As it is I have to strain my neck to look into your eyes. Now I look up to you! Hey, go... go Attend to your work. No... no...! Please spare him. Don't. No, don't. Hello, tell me. Koti, it's me. Go ahead. There's some disturbance, can you hear me? Bro is busy with an important deal. Hey, shut up! Got the photo and address on WhatsApp. If there's any change in plan, let me know. No change in plan. You give him to us and keep going. Okay, don't keep calling us. Pechi. Men are coming from Rayalaseema. When Anbu comes for the ritual to offer the sickle, we don't have to do anything. They'll hand him over to us and keep going. Those thugs know their job like the back of their hand. All that is fine. That aiya will keep interrupting What will you do with him? He won't come I've made other arrangements to keep him away. Let me see. Please come. Aiya, a rare visitor is here. Wonder what trouble he will brew now! Move aside. This is an auspicious time. Let's start the rituals. When have we started without aiya? What are you saying? Aiya's son is here Start with him. He's learning the rope and following his father's footsteps. Let him light the sacred fire. You can sit along with him. If anyone objects, let me know. When have we discriminated them? Junior aiya can step into his father's shoes. Do you agree with me? You are right. Please begin the ritual. Priest, give him the sickle and send him to the river. Be brave [holy chant] We are on the way. Our 'brother' is right next to me. Men from Rayalaseema have arrived [holy chant] Like Kamal in 'Indian 2'! WhatsApp the vehicle ♪ Hey, go. Don't...! No... no... don't. - What's wrong? - Shut up! Go... go. Hey, put down your sickle. Throw it down. Bro, is it you? We came without knowing it was you. Don't mistake us Please forgive us I heard you went abroad. But no one told me about your return. The way you hit me that day I ran for my life, out of this State. How can I forget that! After that I changed my name and address I changed my style a little bit too But I haven't changed my profession! I was informed of an assignment in Madurai I asked if you are involved. You didn't enquire properly. They mentioned... a person named Anbu. That's why I'm here Please forgive me. Bro, phone call 1 minute. Thanks. - Hello...? - Bro, close to the target. - Shall I finish him off? - No, please don't. Didn't lay your hand on him, right? What do you mean? In Theni, Kambam and surrounding areas their word is law Their deeds are just. No one can oppose them and get away. Just let him go. Hey, wait... wait. Listen to me. Escort that boy safely to the temple. Until then ask our boys to safeguard him. Okay, bro. Encircle him All the sides. Who are they? Don't get flustered We are here to protect you. Bro has sent us. Be alert, not 1 fellow should get in. - Okay, bro. - Escort him with care. What's happening here? They promised to kill him. Now they are acting as his bodyguard! Don't worry. My boys will escort him to the temple safe and sound. Can I take a selfie with you? Bro, you are such a bigwig there. He's a small fry - I don't want you to click a selfie. - Is a selfie that degrading? For 6 months I couldn't move my own self. Because of this boy's blows! To quote your own words he's the bigwig in this village. Shall we take a selfie? Bro, put your hands around my shoulder. A slight smile please? I beg you. Please listen. This marriage won't take place I've made all the arrangements for the wedding. How can you change your mind? Don't ask me for reasons. But this wedding won't happen. Yes - Sir...? Look at my daughter's face. She's innocent. At least look at her face and say yes. When you called me to a dead end street, I knew. Your love matter, right? I'm a very sharp fellow I grasp easily. With Facebook and Twitter as household names if a chap wants a girl who hasn't fallen in love all men should be in a loin cloth standing like Lord Muruga in Pazhani. I have a great sense of humor I'll be very witty and you'll enjoy it all your life. Listen, I'm not worried about your life before marriage. If you are faithful to me after the wedding, that's good enough. No, even after marriage... I'll continue. I don't get it I'll be your wife. He'll be the 'other man' in my life! 'Can't live in confusion thinking whose initial the baby will have!' Hey, listen to me. Don't ruin my daughter's life. - What happened, sir? - Old lady, I'll even marry you. But not your granddaughter! My daughter's curse will haunt you for the rest of your life. My daughter is so shaken up! "In the red boulder's shadow." "Perched a sparrow-duo." "Your mischievous glances many lift me up in lilting harmony." "Your mischievous glances aplenty." "Lift me up on my tiptoes dainty." "Not fair what you're doing to me!" "You bet!" "Get set!" "Endlessly." "Tirelessly." "Relentlessly." "Limitlessly!" "When clouds gather dense and gray." "When you glare at me in that way." "When the river bubbles animatedly 2 goats check each other out excitedly." "My heart dances upbeat Flutters for a feisty treat." "Indian mulberry tree blesses you and me." "Indian mulberry tree on a showering happiness spree." "Continuously." "Generously." "Seriously, trust me!" "Rock it." "Benefit." "Don't quit." "That's the spirit!" "Pecking your crest to woo you Eyes like betel nut brand a tattoo." "The coast is clear here If you nod 'yes', I'll come near." "The coast is clear, dear." "If you nod 'yes', I'll come near" "I'll kiss you, mister my handsome rooster." "In the path by the stream lush green 2 quails quietly shelter unseen." "If I whistle loudly to call you I may cause attention undue." "I signalled with my breath, dear Did your soul not hear?" "I signalled with my life, dear." "Did your heart not hear?" "Did your soul not hear?" "Did your mind not hear?" "Did your conscience not hear?" "Elatedly?" "Delightedly?" "Wholeheartedly!" "Fun & frolic." "Weave your magic!" Balu...! Aiya...? Aiya. Aiyaaa! Send immediately. Aiya...? Our aiya called you by name. - What? - Yes, aiya. 'Bro, what happened?' Aiya... aiya! Look at me, aiya I heard him He said 'Balu' Aiya, Balu is here. Aiya, what happened? Aiya. Call the doctor. Doctor, come fast - Aiya. Doctor, check what's wrong. Aiya's BP level is very low. Let us not risk it Rush him to the hospital. Uncle, get the car. Start the vehicle, quick. Aiya. - Aiya...! - Look at me. Aiya... aiya. - Take the short cut. - Hey, take the short route. Doctor, keep an eye. Who is that? Looks like aiya's car. Taking the short cut? Is your aiya in his death bed? You want to go fast? Did he suffer a stroke? Wondering how I know all this? When you can watch the entire festival on CCTV can't I do the same to that single house of yours? If your father's life is important to you... his life is important to me. Handover the life I need. You go with the life you hold as priority. What, man? Thinking for so long? Looks like you'll kill your father. You have only 1 father, right? Sir, aiya is critical now. - Need to leave at once. - Yov! Doctor. Tell him, it's urgent. Is his life more precious to you than your father's? Aiya's life is more precious. Let me go - Anbu, wait. Our aiya's life is no different from the word he has given. I will uphold my father's vow. He will be saved by our village deity Vettaikaruppu. How do you think that's possible? Let us watch him do so. Hey! Take him. Hey Sonai What are you doing? Hey...! Go... if you come near me I will slit her throat. Hey! Listen to me... don't. Hey... go away. Aiya... forgive me I hit him accidentally I swear, I aimed only at Anbu. At that moment aiya came in between. I don't have the guts to stand in front of aiya and fight. If this news leaks out... the entire village will burn my family alive. Instead of getting killed by someone I would rather be killed by you! That will be the only way to atone for my sin. It must have been an accident. In all these 7 villages who has the guts to oppose him face to face and kill him? He is a tiger. You must have done it unknowingly. Our clan is known to protect the lives of those who climb our steps seeking help. We are not here to snuff the life out of anyone. Pray to Vettaikaruppu nothing should happen to our aiya. Go. Aiya, I won't go anywhere near Pechi's house I'll go away to some far off place. Go back to that house. Be there till I give you further instructions. Go. 'Hey! Listen Remove the knife' No... no... don't - Move away. - Start the vehicle. - Leave now, aiya. Hey, start the vehicle fast. Hey listen - Keep going. - Go fast. - Why are you watching? Come this side. Go, go... fast... quick. - Go fast... go. - Listen, let her go. Pechi, are you alright? Not hurt, no? - Follow my instructions. - Okay, doctor. He is unconscious Please wait. Sir, he isn't in a position to talk. - Come with us, doctor. - We'll explain. Aiya. Even after your neck was slashed and seeing all that blood gush out. I kept quiet bound by your words. Concurring with your wish these 3 days of the festival went by real smooth. I lived up to the word I gave you. Now I ask you this as your son. Tomorrow is the last day of the festival and I want you there. If our worship of our village deity Vettaikaruppu is really true. The festival should conclude with your presence. I don't know about doctor, treatment and medicines prescribed for you. But I know this for sure. When I talk, you can hear me. I am sure you will preside tomorrow. You have to come. And share our joy. You will come. It's time for the prayer and procession to the river. Will aiya come now? 'Aiya... aiya' Our bull Muthu broke free and is amidst the crowd now. Muthu, stop. Muthu... listen to me. Take Muthu away. Something has happened to aiya. Aiya... what happened to you? You took us for a royal ride? You blindfolded us for 3 days? Enough of this masquerade. You enacted a drama and made us look like fools. Bro, leave it. Must be the work of Thekkur men. Hey... take out your sickles. They assaulted our aiya We should spare none of them. We agree. Hey stop! If my son had sought revenge the moment he saw me almost bleed to death. For his speed and rage he wouldn't have spared a single soul in that village. But... bound by that single word of mine he has conducted this festival in the most effective, non-violent manner. He carried a load way beyond his age. Till this function concludes today. I don't want any sound of weapons clashing. You start your procession. I asked for only a son to our deity Vettaikaruppu. He gave me a father instead! He is your friend, philosopher and guide for our clan. Give it to him. Bro. Karumayi anna! Paraman is missing He has escaped. What are you saying? Hey, go and search. - Hey come on, let's go. - Go and search I am the one who untied him. Hey... run. Cover them. Don't let him escape. Hold hands. Aiya... where is Anbu? Anbu. The man you've been protecting has been kidnapped now. We can't be patient any longer. We must destroy the entire clan. It's do or die, aiya. I don't want any of you to go. He will handle it singlehanded. This is aiya's vow. With our village deity as witness I ask you. Without a single soul being alive wipe them out and meet me at the river bank. Anbu, sit over there. Don't move an inch till I ask you to 3 hours remaining for the festival to end. Any number of you present here can come. He is right here. Aim your sickle at him if the sickles you honed are sharp enough. If the moustaches you twirled are brave enough. Isn't it a 7 year feud? It shall be squared today. Weren't you hounding us relentlessly? I've made your target sit right in front of you. Come and hack him if you have the guts. "Good lord! Here comes the battle rooster." "His swift blows so strong, I swear." "He can flatten any foe with just a look from head to toe." "He's a veteran with a sickle With any weapon he weaves a miracle." "This tiger's cub don't underrate The tempest just won't abate" [song from 'Sandakozhi - I'] "He has the nerve in toto to braid every vein of his foe." "He will peel your skin Send you reeling in a spin." Is anyone left out? Send... come on. You have lived with enmity festering in you for 7 years. A woman is epitome of love, kindness, sympathy and motherhood. But I see this unrestrained rage only in you. You make an innocent hand hold a sickle? I could've convinced them without resorting to blows. But violence is the only language you understand to acknowledge power. That is why I pounded them first. Let's put an end to our feud with this festival. You are piling up grave blunders. Stop it. It is wrong. Grave blunder indeed! All the actions so far are wrong. Expecting so many men to finish this I was watching from afar. Wrong on my part. That was wrong on my part. Aiya. Face me. Do you compare women to cows, peahens and koels? Even we are lions. Lioness! Only if a man swings a sickle is it a weapon to reckon with? Sickles of our household... will work wonders even in a woman's hand. Stop it. Listen to me. Stop this. Listen to me. Drop the sickle. Didn't you come to fight? Why do you want a truce? You hacked so many men I am a solitary woman Face me... fight. Appease my sickle. You keep interfering. Scared you're unarmed, huh? Take this. Show off your skill Let's gauge your bravery. Come. COME ON...! I am telling you to stop this. Hey... come on... fight. Why are you going out of your way to save him? Is he your elder or younger brother? Father and son claim you've given your word I made a vow too when my husband was killed. His head will be chopped now. Try to save him if you can. Don't! You blamed me for interfering. If I hadn't interfered now?! A sickle can't tell north from south! It slashes according to the course of the wind, that's it. You wanted his entire clan to perish. Your clan would have been wiped out. You wanted to know if he was my brother? Yes. We must regard all those born on our soil as siblings sharing the same blood. Don't discriminate. Still not satisfied with the bloodbath. If your rage has not abated. Take the sharpest sickle lying here and hack me first. Then kill him. I have never seen my mother. My father is my whole world. Other than my father's feet I've never fallen at anyone's feet. I kneel down on this soil, my motherland and I request you. Forego everything. Throw away your hurt and hatred. For 7 years, this earth has not seen rains. Because the festival was held or our vows to Vettaikaruppu were fulfilled it won't rain. Only when your enmity vanishes heart softens. When your eyes shed a drop of tear... only then rain-god will bless our village. He solved all the issues once and for all
