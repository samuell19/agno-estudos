They say this is not the best time to come to the gym... Pardon me? I mean... This is the best time of the day to come to the gym. There's no one! Is it always like this? Yes. You can only find some retired old man or some bored trophy wife. Which category do you fit? MASCARPONE Hey Antonio. Honey! You're home already. What's up? Where the hell did I put it? Enrico texted you: he asks if you already told him. Please be nice and text him back. Antonio, I asked you to cut down on the baking. - Honey... - This is not a bakery house! Will you let me handle this? You sounded so gloomy earlier on the phone... Why don't you help me out? Come on. There's mascarpone in the fridge. Top shelf... The white one. Bravo, that's it! What's on the menu, besides tiramis√π? I'll take care of dinner, don't worry. It's just I'm kinda hungry right now... Okay, let me fix this. You can have a cookie. Careful: it's hot! Wait. Go and wash your hands first. 80 euro a month is a cheap fee. There's a swimming pool, a fully equipped room with all the machines... There's also a tennis court! It's open until late at night during the week... I saw a story on Paolo's Instagram half an hour ago... We can subscribe for 80 euro each month, so that we're not committed or anything, in case we lose our interest, as we did before. Honey. No... Antonio. Antonio... Antonio. I think some exercise would do us good. I don't want to patronize, but you should do something for your back problems. It would do you good. It's not like we have to work out until we look like Pietro Boselli... What do you say? Honey, what's wrong? Eh? Things have been bad for some time now. Tell me. I'm not happy at work, as well as home... You don't know how hard it is, how weary I've grown lately, the thoughts I've had. You never really cared. What are you talking about? But I smile to you when you come home at night... - And I make you dinner, I hug you... - Because everything is always perfect for you! You live in your own world. It's not like that! Honey, that's not because I don't see that you're upset! It's because I try my best to make you happy! You've got to quit trying. There's no use in trying to save something that doesn't work anymore! The ugly truth, Antonio, is that we don't love each other anymore. Enough! Speak for yourself. I'll speak for myself. Do I have to? I'm in love with Enrico. We've loved each other for a year and a half. You love... Who? Enrico. Enrico? Enrico. Enrico... Enrico, Lorenzo? He's fugly, Lorenzo! What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I thought it was just a fling, something bound to end quickly and that there would be no need to talk about it. Of course. Forgive my curiosity. What do you mean "a year and a half"? Since the trip to Croatia? Yes. And you never noticed anything. You only see what your eyes want to see! Of course! It's my fault now, because I've never noticed anything! Lorenzo tell me you're joking, or else I don't know what I'm going to do to you. Listen, Antonio: I'm sorry, okay? That's how life goes. Life's made of moments we cannot foresee, things that happens with no apparent reason and change. And... Puff! "Puff"? Antonio, it's over now. Antonio, all good things come to an end. Of course! So the "thing" with Enrico was a good one! I'm not talking about Enrico. So now we have gay divorce as well? What else are you gays going to conquer next, Champions League on Wednesdays? I need to find a new place, Cristina. You can sleep on my couch if you want... No, thanks. It's important I give him a strong signal. A signal? Yes! That I'm serious about this. That we're breaking up. Now I'm going to find a new place and I move all my stuff there. I'm so confused right now, Cristina. The other day he even asked me if I had started packing already. - Did he? - You see? Of course I was so shaken. He tried to confort me and hugged me... We made love, eventually. Oh, well! Do you want to know what he told me the next day? That nothing had changed and he didn't want to confuse me. Amazing. That's not confusing at all... Hey stud! Hello, honey! What's up? Is everything all right? Sure... Listen honey, I gave Magda the Studio Pollina files. Galli confirmed the meeting at 3. Oh, good. Perfect! Listen, buddy. I had a chat with my friends at the gym. They never saw you there. Why? I gave you a coupon for a free trial... Yes, I know. We need to evaluate and decide... No. "We need to evaluate", "we have to decide"... It's not okay! Would you like to look empowered like Freddie Mercury at Wembley '86? You need to exercise. Workout, workout, workout! Look at me: I'm telling you because I care about you. I really do! What is your husband doing? He's working his ass at the office all the time! But you don't do anything: you're a couch potato! Don't be your own worst enemy. Listen Paolo: please be a good boy and let us finish our lunch. What? Let us finish our lunch... Lunch? - Lunch. - Lunch? Come here, you're my lunch! Excuse me. I need to lunch as well... Carbs are no good for you. I'm off to the gym, you retired old man! I don't understand how you can let that dumbass kiss you like that in public... Hey listen! Just think about all the times I've witnessed all the crazy sex stuff you and your friends used to do when we went clubbing. Maybe this time I found a guy a little above the average. Don't be a downer and face the fact that I got lucky this time, for a change. Do you remember Fulvio, the nerd who was hooked on Magic? Plus, Paolo and I work together, it's convenient. Why didn't you tell him about Lorenzo? Denis? Come in... Hurry up: some guy is coming to rent a room. I'm not surprised, it's such a nice neighborhood... So you're the guy who's looking for a room! Come now, let's have some coffee. Is this your house? No: I'm squatting. Of course it's my house. I inherited it from a wealthy aunt from my mother's side. I usually rent to tourists. But it's so exhausting, every three days check them in, check them out. Open the door, close the door. Japanese tourists that enter the toilet and take pictures even while I'm peeing. The Wi-Fi password! I can imagine... The truth is that a flatmate would be convenient to share the bills and other expenses. But then I have a terrible temper, peculiar habits and an OCD. I don't mean to intrude, but... What do you mean by "peculiar habits"? That I don't like having people around minding my own fucking business. Dans tous les senses. Okay... Now look. I need to rent a room for two or three weeks. One month, tops. I'm probably not going to use it, but I need to move some stuff in there. You're right. Maybe I should explain. I am married. And Lorenzo, my husband... He kinda asked me for a break. So I would like to give him a signal, you know? Yes, okay. Now tell me about you... I am Cancer and my rising sign is Virgo. I like to bake. - I studied Greek and Latin... - No. You got it wrong. What do you do for a living? I'm- I'm an architect. Oh. An architect, how cute! It's 200 euro a week, bills included. C'est tout. "C'est tout", in French, means "Go!" Oh yes! Sure. I'll let you know as soon as possible! Sure. - Ciao! - Ciao. What a drag. 800 euro a week for a room in Montesacro is crazy. I told you honey. All the freshmen are looking for a room right now, we could find something cheaper in January. What do you mean "January"? You need to find a new place now. So we'll do like you said. You'll help me out with the rent for a while and you keep this kitchen, which was my parents' gift for our wedding. I told you already: I'm going to provide for you for the first six months! Why do I have to repeat myself so many times? I'm helping you out while you... The time you... You find yourself a job. Okay? Honey... Listen: why don't we talk about it and find a real solution to our problem? Such as? Such as... Why don't you accept that job offer in Milan? I could easily find a job there! No! I don't want to go to Milan. I hate Milan! Think about it: it would solve everything! - No! - We could have a fresh start there, together! This is not a solution, it's out of the question. Let's just waste 800 euro a month for that room, otherwise we're never going anywhere. It's your money after all... - Hey! - Hello! I'm such a pain in the ass, I came without notice. What are you doing here in Rome? Nothing, just some convention, the usual stuff, we eat junk food all day. Hello dear... Mother gave me this for you to sign. So, guys... How are things? Good... I don't mean to intrude... Then you shouldn't. Lorenzo, I'm your sister: I just want you to be happy. Antonio: you're a brother to me, as well. - I know. - Do you really think there's no way to fix things? Listen dear. We were just talking about it. We'll find a way, don't worry. Antonio, the two of you have always been a role model! Not just for me, but for everyone! We're all so upset back home. Mom doesn't sleep anymore. Aunt Giuseppina prays in church all day long. I've said many times we should lock Aunt Giuseppina in a retirement home already. It's we who are worried for you, Maria Vittoria, when you come here looking like a Penitent Mary Magdalene, Trying to give advice no one asked for! Guys, please! Enough. Listen dear, why don't you have lunch with us? - Because she can't: she has a prior committment! - No, thank you. I have a business lunch. - I'm running late. - Let me get this straight. Did you invite her, Antonio? Did you invite this holy pain in the ass here? Why would I do that? Do you think it's fair, Antonio? They waged a war against us when we became a couple, now they're waging a new one because we're splitting! What do I have to do with this? I don't know. But still, now Maria Vittoria suddenly drops by for an intervention and puff! Now you're allies? After all the mean stuff you've said about her for years? - Which side are you on, Antonio? - Lorenzo: I didn't invite her here! Come on guys, please stop. I came here to ask you to get back together, not to make you fight. Reconsider this. It's a shame to waste such an amazing relationship, after so many years. Lorenzo? Lorenzo. What? Don't be so hasty in shutting doors, you might regret it one day. You can shut the door for me, on your way out. Thank you, dear. Don't even say it. I'm his big sister, it's my duty. I was the one to explain to you what sex was. What are talking about? Shut up, jackass. - Please let me know. - Sure. Jackass! I just can't stand her! - Be strong! - Yes, I will. You should treat her better, she's your sister after all. Do you think it's fair? She drops here, in my house, uninvited. And she preaches when she should mind her own business. Where's respect? No! This is the widow's room. The toilet is there! The door! Enrico... Look at Boris Becker: he looked like Ivan Drago. Come on... - Are you available on Tuesday? - Sure. Text me and we'll see. - Is he a hooker? - I can't wait to go back home. Which planet are you from, stranger? Paolo! Denis. You can call me any name! Sure! Denis, she's Cristina, Paolo's girlfriend. Enchanted! Ciao. Pardon me... How long have you known each other? Since University. Put it there, please. - You're an architect as well? - No, I'm an accountant. We met through his- A common friend... Lorenzo, my husband. The one who asked you for "a kind of a break"? Yes. Speaking about Lorenzo... They invited us for dinner. They? Yes... Lorenzo and Enrico. So Enrico's official now. I'm not going, of course! That moron kicks me out of our house and then invites my friends for dinner. Come on! Antonio, trust me. Let go. He'll be the one to come back to you. Crawling. Ha, sure! I was playing it down. I was kidding of course! Do you wanna go clubbing tonight? No, we're going to the movies. It's late. Paolo, are you done? Just a second... Can we go and wash our hands? √áa va sans dire, ma petite femme blanche! - I lit it up! - Thanks! Bravo... - Paolo! - Coming... Listen... I guess you imagined already I could need this room for more than one month now... Don't worry, you can stay as long as you like! Oh gosh. Thanks! "Thanks" for what? As long as you pay for it. Oh, yes... That's something I'd like to discuss with you. From what I understand, I guess we're on friendly terms, right? So I was wondering if there's a way to lower down the rent, just a little bit... No. This is not possible, ch√©ri, I'm sorry. I see. I'm not taking you out dancing tonight, I'll take you to a job interview! A job interview on a Sunday night? You're such a fuss! Now don't overreact... Quando men vo, quando men vo soletta per la via... Is there a reason why we didn't take a bus? Why would you let someone else drive, when you can ride? Because it's faster and you can sit? Buses are always late... Can you do this on a bus? Where the hell are you going? You're on the wrong side of the road, asshole! He's crazy... You're a fool. Finally! No, guys. I'm sorry... Come here! Where are you going? Trust me. Antonio, Luca. Luca, Antonio. Do I know you? You do? Don't you remember...? I don't... You're still looking for an apprentice, right? Sure. There: Antonio is your man! - Me? - Yes. Don't you think he's a little too grown-up to be an apprentice? Luca. You need an apprentice, he needs a job and I need him to pay his rent. Antonio is an amazing baker. How do you know? Look at these hands! Do you have any baking skills? - I do, actually... - He's amazing. Come on then. Let's try you out. Voil√†! No, Denis. Give it back! - Ciao! - Denis, wait a second... Thank you so much. It's Luca, right? Yes. I'll ask Denis for your number, you'll let me know about the trial. What number? The trial starts now. What do you mean "now"? This is the Christmas week, I need help now. Are you coming? Mind the steps. Lorenzo... Lorenzo? Cristina, I need to see you. Please call me back! So you really worked on New Year's Day as well? Yes, I told you already. I guess you were busy with Paolo... Come on, open your Christmas gift... I'm suddenly glad the holidays are over... - You can wear them next year! - Count on it... Where are we going? Open up... "Romantic Couple Itinerary for two..." With whom, you? I'm not that desperate anymore. Where the hell are we, Cristina? Antonio, can I be frank? I'm truly sympathetic for what happened to you, believe me. I stressed this a hundred times. But still, you're 30, child. Not 70. I'm not even 30 yet... Enough with the mourning! Yes, but then again don't you think that a couple itinerary with some stranger is too much? He's not some stranger! He's a soccer friend of Paolo's. I've never entered a bathhouse in my whole life, do you understand? This is not a bathhouse! This is a classy establishment, not a bathhouse for cruising! Certainly not a place infested by crabs... Sorry for being late, but Virginio's chest wouldn't fit inside the car... Kiss me... Come on! Antonio, Virginio. Virginio, Antonio... Enough with the small talk, our coupon will expire in two hours. Let's go, honey. Keep your eyes up! Be a nice guy, the kid is sensitive... Yes. Don't worry... Since this is a couple itinerary... ...we are going to massage each other! It must be your lucky day: I'm a total pro with massages. I have a PhD in that discipline! How lucky can I get... Let's do this. Lie down! No, Pollyanna. On your back! Try not to display your appreciation too much... Come. Here we go. You know that, according to Thai science, our feet are directly linked to our hearts? Sounds like total bullshit to me. Oh, sorry... Turn around now! Already? You've been stressed out lately, aren't you? I can feel it. A man's back never lies. Okay! You're really a pro with massages. Now why don't we jump in the swimming pool with the others? Sure. Are you serious? Are you home already? Are you asking me for an explanation? Denis... Who is this guy? No one, go on. Will you go to your room? Bravo, Orlandino. My horny Orlandino! Tastes good, huh? You go to your room: I'm paying you a rent and this is a common space. Come on... May I come in? What else do you want? I would like to apologize... Now that you did, you can leave me alone. I can't stand it anymore... I'm so confused... I was supposed to see Cristina and have lunch. However, she must always bring Paolo along. Paolo... Paolo? Am I asking too much if I want to spend some quality time alone with my best friend? I don't think so! As if Paolo was not enough already, there was also a friend of his. Who? Some random guy, Denis! A soccer friend of Paolo's. He was hitting on me... Was he a jerk? Not at all. He was super nice, actually. What I mean is, I just need some sympathy. Is it so hard to understand? What am I? Some dead weight you need to dump to the first guy that comes around? Come on. I don't know what to do when someone hits on me. I don't feel at ease, I'm not used to that. I've been in a steady relationship all my life! Do you know what I mean? No... Antonio, you're not married anymore. You don't have to look for a new husband yet. You need to find yourself before you start looking for love. Too many fairy tales... "Once upon a time...", "...and they lived happily ever after". Since we're little, we are told that you need to find love to be happy. It's a rule. You need to grow up and set your own rules. But, honey, if you don't do that, if you don't understand who you are, what you want, first, you'll end up and find someone who's going to set the rules instead of you. So now, mon ch√©ri... Pull that stick out your ass. There's no stick, Denis... Only spiderwebs! I'm sorry for earlier... Hush. You should avoid that disgusting powder, however. It's bad for you. I only sell it, I'm not using it. Though I feel it on the tip of my penis, actually... You're disgusting! Mamma mia, you really suck! What is this? It's a surprise! We're having breakfast with it, we need to celebrate my last day of work. You're cute, but I still pay you to bake bread. Will you handle me the custard, please? I'm the one in charge of cakes and pastries here. Up until today! I can bake ten of these cakes every night. If I can bake eleven, will you let me stay? There! Luca gave me a raise. Are we having guests for dinner? No, it's for me. It's common to seek refuge in desserts when your heart aches, but you're supposed to eat them, ch√©ri... What refuge! I'm trying new recipes, to submit them to Luca. Listen. Would you take a picture of me while I'm fucking the apple pie? If you only move closer to my apple pie, I'll chop your willy off and you'll be out of business! I need this one. Ciao Francesco! See you. Take them upstairs, please. No, wait! What if your aunt arrives? My aunt will be here in half an hour... Luca, careful! Why don't we go to your place? I only go to my place for sleeping. What are you laughing about? ...so I put my clothes back on and came home. Why won't you tell us his name? Why do you care, Cristina? What matters most is that I gave it away to somebody. What a refined Lady! - It was about time! - Thank you. Then again. Who is it? He's somebody. So, what do you think then? About what? About Luca. I had a doubt there was something between the two of you... Of course there is! Luca sleeps with anything that moves, why not me! Did you use all the right precautions? Of course! Every time we did it. So what's your opinion on recreative sex now? That sound is worth a thousand words... So? How did it go? I'm not sure... Why? We talked for like, two hours. About what? I'm so sorry, I'm a little tense... Let's say I'm a little out of practice! About us. Random stuff. Relax! Did you tell him about Lorenzo? Of course I told him about Lorenzo! This is not a test. It's not! But you know what, I just ended a very long relationship... Rule number 1: you never talk about your exes. We just broke up! What else should I talk about? I've got to go... See you! What are you doing? It's a Rainbow Cake. Are you sure this is how it's supposed to look like? Moron! An homosexual baking a Rainbow Cake: groundbreaking! What's your issue? Nothing. I thought you might be a top, for a while... Said Lady Sinkhole Denis herself. This one's cute. Are you inviting him over? No way. I'll see him for coffee... My boss looks straight into my eyes and yells: "I want that PowerPoint by tonight!" I've been working on it for weeks, bitch. You need to make up your mind! So you need to work on this presentation? Yes, this evening... Let's go to your place. So? Decent enough. Great. Next! Are you serious? Why? TopGun86 looks hot. What do you say? Yes! I'm pretty sure Denis slept with him as well. It's off-limits, then? No. He's not an ex! What's he like? Do you know him? No, never met him. It's time to introduce rule number 2: Never introduce your online dates to your friends. Luca... Would you pull your hand out of my pants, please? Why would I do that? What if someone finds us? When will you be done with these My Little Pony desserts? I signed up for pastry school. Why? Was it Luca's idea? No, it's my idea. Hey Denis! How are you? What are you doing here? He came for me! Come in! Do you guys need condoms or lube? We're good, thank you! Thanks! I'm a little excited, it's the first day... This is not high school. Why are you here? My grandmother infused me the passion for baking and pastries, so here I am. Grandmothers' tales... Enough! This is pastry school: the shrink is in the other side of the building. Passion. "Passion for baking", they say. It's bullshit. Pastry making is about commitment, dedication, precision. Don't believe those who say it's about creativity or improvisation, a good pastry chef never does it. Improvisation is only for the greatest. A good pastry chef needs to pay attention. ...and you, Gemini, certainly don't lack determination. Cancer: I've been telling you for months: this is a year of positive change for you. However, if you're willing to change, you need to listen to those around you. You need to understand what makes you feel accomplished. Later in the year, you'll have to face a big decision, but for now you should just enjoy the fun... So what then? Nothing! One of them reminded me of myself when I pretended to enjoy stuff that only Lorenzo liked. Such as? Such as his childish obsession for Latin music, which I enjoyed up to a point. Or when he got hooked on tennis, all the lessons we took together, our honeymoon in Melbourne was an excuse to see the Australian Open semifinals. That's cool! It was not, Luca. I'll give you a new rule: avoid couples or threesomes. No way. There's only three rules. You only gave me two... The third rule is the most important one. Is it? It's implicit - Shut that thing! It's implied for everyone, even those who say they're looking for a serious relationship. Bullshit. I'm telling you because maybe it's not immediate, it takes a while to understand if no one tells you. We're your guardian angels. Yeah, Statler and Waldorf... You'll see. One time only. One time and that's it. What? Sex, with guys you meet on the apps. Look at him, poor thing. How many guys did you sleep with, in the past weeks? Three. No, four! Bravo! How many of them did you keep in touch with? Two. Did any of them ask you to meet up again? No. Did you ask them? I did, just one. What did he answer? "Maybe next week." Let's go. - Now? - Now. Want to join us? Ciao! Wait! Maybe we're going too fast here. Would you like to slow down a little? I like your house. Is this your room? I'm looking for a relationship. It's just that it seems impossible to find someone who's looking for the something serious, here. It's like a market! People dating four different guys at the same time, it's an absurdity. I'm going to delete the app. I'm sick of meaningless dates. Casual sex is not that interesting. Don't you agree? I'm telling you this because I feel like you understand me. I don't know. You don't look like the one night stand type. I found this under the bed. Okay! I'll text you later. Yes. Sure. All right. See you later! Later! - Ciao. - Ciao! Good. Bravo! Good, Mimmo. Bravo. We're not there yet, Antonio. You need to practice more at home. Why are you looking at me funny? No, nothing. Are you sure you're 22 years old? "22" is not my age, it's the centimetres... Believe me, I'm so sorry, I'm not the ghosting type. Don't worry. I'm so relieved you texted me back, some people hold grudges forever. I can imagine... You see the trouble is that I tend to run away when I find someone that I truly like. Why don't we have lunch together? No! I can cook you something! No, I have stuff to do. C'est tout. "Said who"? No. "C'est tout" is French. It means it's time for you to leave. I've seen better... What the fuck... Okay. This is an acrylic tracksuit. What is this? A tennis racket? Are you an instructor? Easy! You're hurting me... Does this kind of approach usually work? Easy! You moron... How was the first tennis lesson? I didn't go. What do you mean? You've been going on for months with this tennis obsession, you signed up for lessons and you don't go? It's crazy, isn't it? As I was walking there, I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy. And you know what I discovered? That it makes no sense at all to take tennis classes without you! - You're completely crazy... - This thought led me to an epiphany. Close your eyes. - Again? - Close your eyes. Don't peek. Whenever I do something... Anything, even the silliest thing, and you're not by my side, it makes no sense at all for me. Antonio? Antonio? Are you okay? Sure! You look upset... No, I'm okay. Thanks! Would you like to have a drink? Deal. Why are you cleaning up? I don't like leaving a mess. Would you like to help me out? Listen, Antonio. Why are you here? This is a basic course for discouraged dads or angry managers... People who don't have your skills. I've been working in a bakery for a while. And I have to say that this school is everything but a walk in the park! A walk in the park... I don't know what your plans in life are. But, if you like to become a pastry chef, you need to try harder. Passion could be a great drive and blah, blah, blah... But you can't pay your bills with sheer passion, you can't provide for your family with it. If you're only passionate, there's no difference between you and some poor housewife who bakes cakes just to fee You got me? Dedication. Sweat. And cleanliness. See you on Monday. Maybe I should throw your phone in the blender. It won't be of any use for the final exam anyway. Thomas? Antonio? Is this your place? No, it's temporary. Where do you live? Milan. Ah, Milan... Figa! No, please! It's not a matter of ego! This is my ex's place. He lives in Berlin with his new partner now. He asked me to take it with me when I leave. What are you eating, in the picture? Tiramis√π. I thought so... My grandmother used to make an exquisite tiramis√π. She said it was all about mascarpone, which is the most important ingredient. She believed that it's not good to buy ready-made mascarpone at the supermarket, because one can only make a good tiramis√π with the mascarpone you make yourself. I guess it's not that hard to make mascarpone. There are some tricks that could be deceiving. Like the acidity of the lemon you use, the temperature... The sieve itself, the piece of cloth you use to separate the serum. She used to say: "If the mascarpone is good enough, you can eat it on its own". Was she right? She thought so... What do you think? - I think I should go... - What do you do tomorrow night? Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it? I guess we'll go out clubbing, but first we'll have dinner and watch some TV. What's on TV? Come on, it's your own mother! She won't forgive here. What a bitch! Where's Paolo? Playing soccer. Then why am I setting the table for five people? Because the whore in the bathroom invited a friend over! Will you guys open the door? The door, please! Hi! Thomas. Luca. Come in. Thanks. May I come in? - Hey! - Come on in! - Thomas. - Cristina! Nice! I like the place... Oh yes: we worship reality TV shows. Where's Antonio? Antonio is in the bathroom putting his make-up on. Take a seat! Thank you. This is a nice table! Wouldn't you say I'm very nice as well? Yes, I would! Should I sit someplace in particular? No, honey. Sit where you like... Here! Who's that? Nothing, just some guy I chat with... Are you sure he's just "some guy" you chat with? Come on, Luca... Okay, Thomas: tell us a little more about you. You live in Milan, but you're not originally from there, are you? Impressive, wow! You're well informed. Yes, I come from Emilia-Romagna, but I live in Milan. And you're a photographer. Yes, exactly. Now I'm here in Rome, working for a Foundation. I'm helping out with a couple of projects and I'll be here until October. I need some help for a photoshoot, all the photographers I know are sex maniacs with an obsession for my toes. Do you shoot nudes as well? I'm more of a reporter, actually... Shame. The Mystery Celebrity Surprise is coming up! Did you make the mascarpone by yourself, like your grandmother said? - No, I didn't have time. But it's good anyway, isn't it? - Super good! We have to help him out, he needs to pratice... Practice for what? I'm taking classes at a pastry school. The teacher is a total bitch. She stares at you and she's super judgemental! The last time she told me that she expects more from me. What a bore! Who is this? The "bitch" he's complaining about is one of the best pastry chefs in Rome. She might be one of the very best, but she should drop the attitude. She's the same age as us... - She must be some daddy's little girl... - How old are you, anyway? She's not daddy's little girl and that's not attitude, it's drive! Anyways, she picks the best among her students to work in her pastry shops as apprentices. Aren't you a little too old to be an apprentice? The last time you asked this it worked out fine, didn't it? Are you afraid to lose your best baker? I guess we'll be just fuck buddies, then. I'm sorry about Luca... So you two have sex? "Have sex"... Let's say he helped me get over it after my husband dumped me. I see. You fuck him. Sometimes we did, as friends. Just like that... How long were you with your ex husband? Since high school, until October last year. Twelve years? - Yes. - Amazing. In gay years it's 84, like dogs... Oh yes. So I'm not really in the mood for relationships right now. I understand. I'm taking a break from relationships as well. But still. With you it's different. Listen. You can laugh at me if you feel like it, but I feel a connection. Okay. Listen: what's your name again? Thomas, right? You don't need to sell me anything, we're going to have sex anyway tonight. What about tomorrow? Good, bravo! No. No. The fridge spoiled your mascarpone. It's the perfect consistency. It's too sour. You put too much lemon. Should I put some more cream? You should throw it away. Exquisit. Bravo, Giacomo! Thanks! Hey Antonio! I'm a Mystery Celebrity and I'm offering you a way to end all of your miseries. Hey honey! I'm at home, you can drop by later, whenever you like. I'll take care of dinner, there's something I would like to tell you about! You were supposed to be checking... I was just about to! They're not burned, they're crispy! It's the second time that happens, in three days. Be careful! Fuck. You bumped into me! Does it hurt? No. - Are you mad? - No. I'm disappointed. Why is that? Disappointed by your attitude, for some time now. - By my attitude? - Yes. I understand. It's mutual, then. - I beg your pardon? - You heard me. No, I would like an explanation! You've started to treat me differently since I'm with Thomas. So now you're with Thomas? Does it bother you? It's your own fucking business, I don't care what you do when you're not working here. Great! Fuck you... Honey? Can you help me with with a photo shoot? What photo shoot? Some pictures for my OnlyFans. They delivered me some new jockstraps and I want to try them on. Look, honey... I'm off to Thomas', actually. That's too bad: I would've loved to help you taking pictures of your butt. Pas de probl√®me! What time did you come back this morning? I didn't hear you... It's just that... I had a fight with Luca, about Thomas. Never mind! He loves to play the alpha male sometimes. I quit, actually... What an overreaction. I'll take care of everything, don't worry. Parigi, o cara, noi lasceremo... Is Thomas any good at baking pastry? Why? I don't know, it seems like you quit baking as well. The exam is on Thursday, isn't it? You could use some of this "holiday leave" to work on your baking skills. Okay, Denis. I'll do it tomorrow. What's the matter? I don't really care about pastry school that much. Okay... Are you really patronizing me while wearing a jockstrap? It's pretty hard to take you seriously, believe me. I'm not patronizing you. Couldn't you just be happy for me, then? I'm happy for you when you take the bull by the horns, not when you chicken out before a challenge. To do what, by the way? Hide in someone else's shadow? Yeah, right. Ciao... Sempre libera degg'io folleggiare... Hey Antonio! How's it going? My sister's getting married next May. It's going to be a gloriously depressing experience. Is there anything sadder than 40-year-olds getting married? It's not going to match the beauty of our wedding, anyways. Do you remember it? Maria Vittoria is in Rome right now and she would like to give you the invitation herself. You know Maria Vittoria, she cares about these things. I don't know if you feel like coming... I don't think Enrico is going to come. I'm telling you this because... I don't know... You can bring a plus one, of course. I don't know if you're seeing anyone at the moment. I should mind my own business anyways... Good morning, handsome! Good morning! Hello. You're spoiling me, I'm getting used to it. The sooner you get used to it, the better. Would you like to come to Milan with me? Yeah, why not... What? We've been dating for a while, but we don't know each other that well yet! I think we know each other well enough. Yes, but not enough to take such a giant leap... Come on now! I didn't ask you to marry me, I asked you to come to Milan with me for a few months. Okay, listen. We would live in a huge mansion. Okay, then... The garden looks like a forest. There's a tennis court and a pool. Didn't you say you play tennis? Of course I do. It's been a while, though. I'm not Federer, but I have a good forehand. I could be quite challenging, on a good day! Come with me. Let's work together. The Foundation has the budget for a good architect, which you are. Tommy I've never done anything like this! That's the point! What do you have to lose? What can I lose... I have my life here, my friends, the pastry school. It would be such a dramatic change for me... I'll be by your side. Okay? Sorry... Luca? Yes sir... He's checking on you... Hello? I'm Denis' mother. My condolences, madame. Are you looking for anything in particular? Do you know where he kept his money? - Madame... - Irma. Would you like a glass of water? Listen, why don't you take a break and come back another day? There's no rush. I'm in a rush indeed! The rent of this place is really expensive! What do you mean "rent"? Isn't this house yours? Mine? Seriously? Do I look like someone who could own a place like this? Denis was such a bullshit artist... His damn obsession to run around with that bicycle... But that motherfucker who run him over is going to pay. I'm going to make him pay good money for what he did. Gross. Were you his lover? I'm his friend. Oh. I've never thought he had friends. I've never thought he had a mother! Lorenzo! What are you doing here? I'm here to offer my condolences. Thank you. I know it's awkward to say this, but I'm happy to see you. You disappeared. Do I owe you an apology? You've never texted me back or called me in a very long time... How are you? I'm okay. Cristina told me you have to leave the house. Did you find anything yet? No, I didn't. Let's say I'm evaluating some options. - Oh! - Yes. I'm probably moving to Milan. Why don't you come home, in the meantime? Why would I go back to my parents? Our home. What about Enrico? Puff? Ciao, Lorenzo... - Hello! - Hi! - Hello Antonio! - Good morning. My daughter, Linda. Are you helping mommy out today? Yes. She helps me out with the finals. If a cake is good for the taste of an 8-year-old girl, it means it must be good. Especially if the girl is used to taste her mother's cakes. Right, honey? Thanks. Are you nervous? No. Good! - Good morning! - Good morning. Surprise! You're not leaving without saying goodbye, are you? Guys I already emptied the fridge, I'm sorry... What's that? Just some mascarpone I made for the exam... It's okay. Coffee's enough! Speaking about the exam: the second best of your class, that's brilliant! In a class of five people... Come on! You're not his boss anymore. He's a pastry chef now! Who's going to Milan to be an architect. Milan is just three hours away by train, I'm not moving to Australia! You can visit me anytime! Maybe for some shopping. Are you afraid you'll miss us? Isn't this your "happily ever after"? Enough. Hello, handsome! You're here already? Okay... Let's go and get your stuff. I brought you this. What is it? SORRY Tommy... I can't leave with you. A lot of things happened lately... Denis, of course... But not only that. I'd rather not to cling to anyone right now. Even if it's you. Even if moving to Milan would make me very happy. Then come! No, Tommy. I would be happy in the beginning, but then it would go exactly like with Lorenzo. Is Enrico moving to Milan as well? Enrico was a consequence. I guess I should thank him, actually. Is this what you want to do? Bake pastry? I don't know if I'm going to do it forever, but I would like to try. Without hiding in someone else's shadow. You know what? My grandmother was right. Mascarpone has a special taste, if you make it on your own. May I? Sure! I brought a napkin as well... Now I can try it! Ciao, Antonio. How about this one, Tommy? It's my gift. MASCARPONE
