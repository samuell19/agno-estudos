THE END OF OPERATION "SECRET AGENT" PART TWO Thanks. The non-alcoholic cocktail 'Dream'. Can I ask your ladies for a dance? Welcome. Probably, I'll still need this letter. But why did you steal the photo, goddamn it? Okay, take a better look. Who is there? - It's me. Why did you get in the picture? I was too slow to turn around. - Stupid. Easy. If they start to check the girls, contacts with foreigners and the stuff, and see this picture, they'll get to me. One picture doesn't change anything. You say there's another one. Right, Galya has it. I'll have to get that one too. Enough of your amateur activities. Are you sure that Gapenko wasn't tailed in Suzdal and Rostov? I didn't notice anyone. Okay, listen. You'll meet with Gapenko... and hand him the key imprints. Ask him to make the keys. Is there any alarm system in Nesterov s apartment? Before leaving, Galya connected the alarm system to the precinct. I remembered all. Draw their apartment layout. And you, Mikhail Mikhailovich, go make some coffee. Listen. You're making a housewife out of me. I wouldn't complain in your place. How many days was I locked up here... while you were relaxing out there? Do the math! You say 'relaxing', Mikhail Mikhailovich, could you doctor driver's papers in my name? A driver's license? No, I got a driver's license. Papers for your car. You mean a power of attorney No problem. What's the place where Nesterov's country house is? Otradnoye. You'll have to go there. Make note of Nesterov's and all his household's daily schedule. They will probably have security there. Find out what kind it is. Draw the layout of the area. Where, what. And rent me a room in Otradnoye, close to their country house. And one more thing. Oh, the 19th century. Are you gonna stay here long? I hope until the train leaves. Olga, dear, I got a business proposal for you. But I don't know how to start. I need money to make the first payment for a cooperative apartment. But I'm very low on cash now, so to speak. And apart from it, I often go abroad for my job, you know... I can't sell jewelry to anyone, even to the state. Here. They belonged to my granny. I don't know how much they're worth. Is there a pawnbroker in the town? - Sure. Could you got them appraised there? Okay, I'll go right away, it's nearby. I'll wait in the park. - Okay. I was at the jeweler's. They're worth 5,000. Probably more. I told him they'll give 4, however he has to wait till someone buys them. But he needs money for a new flat now. Maybe he'll sell them for 3? So what? You really are stupid, how can we pass up the chance? I would do anything to have these earrings. But I don't have that kind of money. - So what do you propose? To take money from your mom. To offer them to her? - Finally you got it. She'll give them to you to wear, and you'll lend them to me. And what will I say to her? Say your girlfriend got in trouble and needs money now. Mom... Hi. - Hi. Galya. I want to talk to you. Where did you get them? They are my girlfriend's. We need 3,000. Now. Wow! Are they real? - Sure. Do you like them? Yes. I do. But I need to talk to your dad, and he'll won't be here until the evening. These academicians are basking in the sunshine. However, our director of the stockhouse lives way better. He has no security, but he has a private swimming pool instead. Hasn't he drowned in it yet? - He will drown very shortly. Mom likes the earrings very much, but she needs to ask dad. He'll be home later today. Can you wait till morning? What else can I do? I'm doing it only for you. They gave 3,000 for the earrings. If you had owned a jeweler's shop, you would've quickly gone out of business. Really? But you said it yourself, you need money now. I rented a lodging, left a 50 ruble deposit. Then the hotel, the fare, per diem allowance. Here is 2,900 rubles. And 15 kopecks. This is cute, per diem allowance is 2 rubles 60 kopecks in your country, and you charge me 10. For hazardous working conditions. Where did you rent the lodging? The last house on the other bank of the river. The address is on the back. And their country house? Across the bridge, about 300 meters off. Did you see Nesterov? - No, he was to arrive in the evening. Have I reached 202-15-15? No, you have a wrong number. I'm sorry. Is there anybody here,? Bob Stewart, the attaché of the embassy. You know him. In 1976, he worked in Czechoslovakia. Then we lost track of him. Later he showed up in Poland. And since last year he has been in Moscow. Do we have anything on him? There was one lead pointing at him, but we couldn't trace it to the end. There is a ton of circumstantial evidence against him, but he's always on alert. Show this Gapenko to me again. Can you see some connection between ﻿Ilyin's visit to Nesterov's apartment and his coming? Very possible. I'll send Kuznetsov to Gorky. I'm from the State Security Committee. I need to talk to you. Okay. Andrei Mikhailovich Kuznetsov. Come in, please. Thank you. The other day you had a guest, Mikhail Mikhailovich Ilyin. What do you know about him? He is from Moscow. Works with the Vneshtorg company. Where did you meet him? He brought a parcel from Italy for Olga, my girlfriend. From whom? From Pietro Mattinelli. And who is this Mattinelli? An engineer, worked here at the nitrogen fertilizers plant. If you want, I can show you his photo. Sure. This is me, this is Olga, and this is Pietro Mattinelli. And... who is this? Wait. Mikhail Mikhailovich. We didn't notice him. Why is he sitting by himself^ You just said you know him. I don't understand it. Can I take the photo with me? Okay, only return it, please. I don't have another one. My girlfriend had the other one, but it was stolen, and the letter, too. Galya, could you do me a favor? Don't say a word about our talk to anyone, even to Olga. No problem. I took this photo from Galya Nesterov. The guy on the right is Ilyin. At the hotel in Gorky I learnt that he lives in Moscow. on Vernadsky Prospekt. If they're trying to get to the Nesterov, why such a huge interest in Olga? I got the impression that Olga bosses Galya around. Their plan is very simple - to get access to Nesterov via Olga. It's too complicated. Why? He got into Nesterov's apartment, right? And another interesting thing... Olga had the same photo. But it disappeared together with the letter from Mattinelli. Then it's a total mess altogether. Pietro was the first who met Olga, the first parcel came from him. It means he launched this operation. But why steal the letter and the photo then? To get a signature sample? He could give it in Milan. Something's wrong here. We need to find this Ilyin, and we need to do it fast. Judging by this photo you know the guy we're after. Ah, this is Nesterov. A big scholar from Russia. We met at the convention on the issues of radio electronics in London. This manuscript belongs to him. And this is a tape where he talks with Professor Lawrence. You're going to Moscow, and we would ask you to meet with Nesterov. May I come in? - Yes. Pyotr Petrovich, actually our Ilyin is not Ilyin. How come? Here's a photo of the real Ilyin. And this is the one you saw. I went to Ilyin's home. He wasn't home, he's a shop foreman in a plant. I asked his wife to give me his picture. Last year he either lost his ID or it was stolen. Vladimir Gavrilovich, to the lab, please. Make copies and report him. One copy for me. Speaking. Want to go to Moscow? Are you serious? - Absolutely serious. And what if... It's been a long time, it's unlikely someone will recognize you in Moscow. Do you think so? - Sure. You'll go in a group of businessmen. You'll be totally on your own, no contacts whatsoever. For the record - you're there to attend the International Book Fair. That's my cover, so to speak. But what am I supposed to do there? You'll track down a man and go with him to a place which I'll indicate. He is to find there a stash with two containers and two batteries. He's to leave the container there. As for the batteries, you'll hand them to Krug. Is he going too? - Right. As my assistant? He'll leave a day later, posing as a reporter. Is that it? Not yet. Your other mission is a little more delicate. I'm sure you heard of Academician Nesterov, right? I read something in the papers. He is a physicist, isn't he? Yes. Professor Nimeier, who you're going to accompany on this trip, has a special proposal for Nesterov. But, unfortunately, Nimeier is totally ignorant of the Soviet Russian people's psychology. You're Russian. And I think, if it's necessary, you'll be capable of giving Nimeier a hand in accomplishing this very delicate mission. And afterwards you'll give me a complete report of what he said and of how Academician Nesterov reacted to it. By the way, here's his file. Read it through. Nikita Stepanovich? - Yes. What do you want? Hi. Zakharov sends his regards. Ah, and how is he getting on? Alive and kicking, thanks to your prayers. I got it. Come in. The lab report says that these batteries contain a concentrated virulent toxic substance inside them. And a remote-control explosive device. Here's the place where these batteries were hidden. It completely coincides with the map which he sent to us. Are you to take them to your boss? I need to hand them via King, the sooner the better. The boss has recently got very restless. Did they read about the cliff-hangers? - Yes. That is why they got so worried. If this hiding place is uncovered, the whole operation "Map" goes to the dogs. Right... more tea? Yes, please. - Okay. Have you got anything on Brokman? - On Brokman... Stevenson gave me two addresses. But he outwitted me with the names, gave me the old ones. No one would've found them by those names. No way. But I tracked down Zakharov, and found out their current names Gapenko and Voropayev, they both were Abwehr agents back then. My boss told to me where to find Gapenko. I think, if Brokman had been there, he would never have qiven this address to me. So probably, Brokman is at Voropaeyev's place, huh? Possible. But I don't have Voropaeyev's address. Zakharov warned me that all contacts are via the main post office only. I need to send a postcard and set the time of our meeting. Aleksandr wants to talk to you. - Let him in. A telegram from Updike. - Read it. We've got information that Pietro Mattinelli is taking a flight to the USSR on Wednesday, the 26th. Today is the 24th? - Right. He can't go there. No way. Or at least get to his destination. His showing up in Gorky is completely ruled out. Attention, please. Aeroflot Flight 284 from Milan has just landed. Sveta, come here, please. Look at the screen. Do you have anything to declare? - No. Is this your baggage? - Yes. Come with me, please. Come on. Pyotr Ivanovich, we have unexpected news. What's up? Customs officers arrested Pietro Mattinelli at the Sheremetyevo-2 airport. They found batteries in his bag. Like the ones the cliff-hangers had? They look similar, but those ones lack an explosive and the filling is different. Moreover, they found a kind of remote-control device in the unopened box of chocolates. Has Mattinelli come on business? - Right, for 2 weeks. The plant summoned him. We informed the plant authorities that his coming there is delayed. Is he so naive that he will carry all this stuff openly? I don't think so. He swears he has no idea how this all got in his bag. He says that in Milan he had no problem with the customs check. This doesn't mean anything. I'm sure he's been set up. However, I can't get this trick with Mattinelli to the end. You see. Mister King, he'll be now deported from the country. Which means he won't get to Gorky. We've done a lot, working on these young ladies. It's time to finish the deal. Mattinelli will become a secret agent in their eyes. This will scare them and force them to accept our proposal. And we will be getting information about Nesterov straight from his home. It's a long shot but you know betst. I'm going to Moscow. Where will Tulyev stay? At the National hotel. Bye. - Good luck. Lena, I'll call you. Olya. Olya, shall we wait for you? Go, I'll catch up with you. Mikhail Mikhailovich, hi. How are you doing? You come here so often. I need to talk to you. Let's go. Shall we pick up Galya? - Not this time. Okay, just not very long. - Sure. I'd like something to eat. Whore can we eat here? Let's go to the Lesnoy? Do you know the way there? - I'll show you. I need to talk to you face to face. You sound so mysterious. Why? What's wrong? The engine overheated, we'll have to wait. What a view. I used to come here with my dad, especially before his test flights He believed this place brought him good luck. And then he was gone. And I didn't get into university. That's how things are. So what did you want to tell me? Olga, we're in big trouble. What do you mean "we"? - You and me. Partially Galya and her mom. But basically you and me. I don't get you. Come on, explain it. Who do you think Pietro is? You are partners with his company. You said it yourself. The company is just a cover. What are you talking about? At what price did they estimate my earrings? I already said. - 4,000? Right. And they bought them for 3? - Yes. Olga, why are you lying? I dropped by the pawnbroker's. They estimated them at 5,000. And offered to put them on commission for 4. But you talked me into selling them for 3. You cheated me, along with Galya and her Mom. We'll give them back to you. Olga, let it be my small gift to you. By the way... about gifts. How many parcels did you get from Pietro? Two. - You know how much they're worth? We didn't do the math. Come on, you work in a shop. and you know very well that these jewels cost a fortune. We'll return them, too. There's no way to return gifts. You're to pay for them now. What do you want from me? You're a smart girl. I appeal to your common sense. You're a beautiful, charming, sociable young lady. You have such a big impact on Galya. The Nesterov's house is open to you. And you can always know where Nikolai Nikolayevich is at the moment, either away on business, or in town, or in his country house. Now I can't say what other questions might interest... them. Who? Not me. Pietro and his friends. As it stands, those parcels, which you already have, are just nothing compared to what you're going to get in the future. Let's got out of here. Okay. Wait. You must say yes or no. And you understand that not a soul should know about our conversation, right?. Am I supposed to sign some papers? You're still a kid though you look like a grown up girl. What I ask you to do is as innocent as a child's kiss. But if you say a single word to anyone... You are a bastard! - Right. But look at you. You're no angel either. So, a deal? I'll tell everything to the police. That you were Mattinelli's mistress? - It's a lie. And how will you prove it? By the way, do you listen to the foreign radio? Fuck off. I recorded it just for you. They broadcast yesterday that your Mattinelli was caught red-handed at Sheremetyevo-2 as a foreign secret agent. You're lying! - Olya! Olya! Olya! Olya, dear, wait. I'll explain everything! Olga! Olga! Olga! Mikhail Mikhailovich. What is it? You get sick or what? - I killed Olga. What? I said what you told me to say, but she refused. Idiot! Damn! How did it happen? - I hit her with the car. Is she dead? I don't know, but I hot her hard. Any dents on the car body? - Not a scratch, I checked it. I hit her with the side. Did the road patrol stop you? - Once, near Moscow. Why? - For papers' check. Is the car filled up enough? Enough to run about 50 kilometers. - Not enough. I'm not gonna fill it up at the gas stations. No way. I got 3 full cans in the garage, then I can borrow some gas from truck drivers. Fill it up to the brim. Park the car in some alley, and lock up the garage. Hey, listen... I've been driving throughout the night, rushing here! And you've been relaxing here. Easy, easy Do as I tell you. Speaking, Vladimir Gavrilovich. Good morning. - Morning. We got a call from Gorky. Olga Kostrova was hit by a car yesterday. She was found early this morning. The ambulance rushed her to the hospital. Her condition's critical. Where did it happen? - 20 kilometers outside of town. How did she get there? We don't know yet, but Kostrova's friend saw how she got in a Zhiguli with a Moscow plate. The driver was an elderly man, she called him Mikhail Mikhailovich. You said Mikhail Mikhailovich? - Right. Contact the road patrol and get Kuznetsov involved in the investigation, too. Speaking. The car is filled up, it's waiting by the gates. Where's the cash you got for the earrings? Put it in the bank. It's risky to keep that kind of money at home. And besides - the interest. Here's... the bankbook. How much cash do you have on you? I don't know, probably 100-120 rubles. The car keys and the registration papers. Here you go. Okay, Mikhail Mikhailovich. Let's sit a bit before hitting the road. Could you do me a favor? When you meet Zakharov, ask him to tell my son that I live with the hope to see him one day. What son? - Mine. Zakharov made it all up, you have no son. This is a joke. Please, say this is a joke. Easy. - This is a joke, right? At night the road patrol pulled over a Zhiguir on the Gorky-Moscow-highway for a regular papers check. With a Moscow plate. The color is the same as the color of the car Olga Kostrova was in. Part of the number, 21, also matches. The car owner is Mikhail Mikhailovich Voropayev, resides in Skornyazhny Lane, Moscow. Can it be that he is that very Voropayev Tulyev is talking about? Very possible. Look, they've just been brought from the data center. The guy in glasses is Mikhail Mikhailovich Kutepov. In 1943 he served in Krasnodar, in the SS 10-A sonderkommando. Participated in punitive operations, reported in search as a war criminal. And here's the forensics report. It says that this Kutepov And our mock-llyin are one and the same person. Is this the bank? - How can I help you? When do you have a lunch break? - Which number have you dialed? 165-15-11. Sorry. The wrong number. So what do we have here? He died about 2 hours ago. Pyotr Ivanovich. Stewart has just put the stuff in the stash on Verkfinyaya Moichanovka, on the construction premises. The stash is put under surveillance. Contact Hermes, now. Fill him in on the situation and why you're calling him. Enter this into the record. - Okay. Speaking. Andrei Mikhailovich? - Speaking, Vladimir Gavrilovich. Go to the ring-bolt highway, to the 105th road-patrol post. Contact the 43rd, he'll fill you in on the subject. Don't arrest him until you're ordered to. You need to find out where he's heading and why. 12th, do you copy me? - I'm 12th, I copy you. I'm 43rd The subject is before the refrigerator. 2nd, I'm 12th, the subject turned to Gorky highway. Warn Gorky to put the capture squad at stand-by. And you take a flight there, too. - Okay. To Johann from Brokman. Bad news? - Nothing good. Everyone thinks he's an expert on contemporary psychology of young Soviet people. Me, an old fool, thought so too. And then it turns out that one idiot hits a girl with his car, and the other one shoots him. It's the confrontation of the two systems, of the systems! And we... are hunting for a single man. Kolia? - Yes, it's me. I decided to come home. - Right. Since when have you been hiding ladies' things in your drawers? I don't get you. Me neither. Have you been giving money to Galya recently? I guess, I have. - You guess or you have? I have. How much? I don't remember, about 100 rubles. But why? I can't talk about it on the phone. We'll talk when you come. Okay. What's new in Moscow? I got a call from the academy. Professor Nimeier from the FRG has arrived. I met him in London. To talk about the foreword to my book, which they're going to publish. Today I'll be meeting with him. Okay, Mr. Nesterov, let's think we settled it with the foreword. I hope it won't be too long, I need to go over the corrections. Okay, here's the publishers' agency. We're ready to show you not only the corrections, you'll have the book layout, the cover, the jacket and everything else. I'd be much obliged. Welcome to the table. - Thank you. Oh, this is a real feast. - Russian hospitality. Okay, what have you got here? Triple? - With sterlet. What do you say? Good! Very tasty. Sit down at the table, please. Hi. - Hi. Is it your first time here? Unfortunately, I participated in the POW's march held in 1944 in Moscow. Oh, shashlik. - Right. Here you go. - Thank you. Mister Nesterov, there's something very delicate we need to talk to you about. Go ahead. Do you remember the cocktail party back in London at Professor Lawrence's place? I wouldn't like to recall it. However, you'll need to hear something. Please. This is a recording of your talk with Professor Lawrence. Did you recognize your voice? It's really my voice. Right. And the words are somebody else's? How did you doctor this crap? What are you talking about? Why "doctored"? But that's not all. Haven't you written all this? Haven't you... smuggled all this abroad? It has been stolen. Right. Good job. But you can avoid trouble. They want you to cooperate with them. You understand, we are not involved in this. But we recommend that you accept this offer. Did you hear what I said to Mr. Lawrence at the cocktail party then? I wasn't there. - Then ask him. If you weren't my guests now... See you, gentlemen. I warned Staube that it wouldn't work. In your view, is it possible for us to put pressure on Nesterov in any other way? I don't think so, it can only trigger off another scandal, and that's it. So now we can do only one thing. If I ask your boss to take care of Nesterov under certain conditions... What do you mean, under certain conditions? I'm afraid that our common acquaintance Yanus will quit the game. His second address was uncovered, too. However, he himself managed to escape. But we don't know yet whether he's being tailed. I won't rule out Nesterov's country house is fortified by a strong security. And Yanus' plan is way too risky. Mister King. I'm a spy, and not a contract killer. I ask you to remember this. I've never supported your methods, this is not news to you either. We don't care about what you think, Mr. Tulyev. It's up to us to decide. Mom. Mom. Mom, Olga is in the hospital, she's been hit by a car. I know. If you hang in the joints, you'll be hit by a car too. What's this, huh? Where did you get all these clothes? I'm talking to you. Where did you get the money to buy them? Can you answer me, huh? They are a gift. A gift? What gift? Olga's friend gave them. Right... An friend. Here we are. How old are you, huh? Do you understand that such gifts are not given for nothing? Mom... - What? Mom, forgive me, please. Do you want to disgrace your dad and me? Do you understand who your dad is or not?! Come on, get up, put all this stuff in the bag. If it is from the same friend, I'll throw them away together with all your things! So you say that King mentioned the Nesterovs' country house? Right, he said that there's a strong security there. And what about Yanus' plan that King called risky? It's the plan to take Nesterov out, as he turned down the proposal. Can we suppose that Brokman will try to get into this country house? Hardly, it's way too risky. But to meet him somewhere. Whil he's taking a walk in the forest, or is fishing or hunting.. Anyway, you also need time for that. And besides, to be somewhere close. Somewhere close. Find Academician Nesterov. Now. And connect me to Markov, he's in the Department in Gorky. Sir. Good evening. - Hi. Did Mikhail Mikhailovich talk to you about the room? Right, and even left a deposit. Welcome, come on in. Thanks. Excuse me, Nikolai Nikolayevich, I need to talk to you. Go ahead. General Lukin didn't have a chance to talk to you in Moscow. You left before he called. Could you do us a favor? Please, don't go to your country house today. Has anything happened? - No, everything's okay. We reserved a room for you in the hotel Rossiya. To Yanus. Execute the mission immediately. Report when you are done. Leave across the southern border at the spot known to you. Hermes. Good morning. Hi. Sit, have breakfast with us. Thanks, I don't want to eat. I'm gonna take a stroll. I've brought you milk fresh from the cow, took it from my neighbor, try it. Milk? Nothing can beat milk Are you going to stay here long? Till I get bored. Live as long as you wish. It'll be more fun for us. Thank you. - Welcome. Sir. - Yes? Hi. - Hi. Can I get in? - Welcome. Can you rent me a room? - Sorry, you're too late. I already let in a tenant yesterday. Too bad - Go and ask my neighbors. Shit... Go, Brokman. Brokman scaled up his lips. Why, he's talking. But he doesn't say a word about what interests us. He was in contact with the attaché, but we shouldn't bother the attaché. All this should look natural to them. We'll have to get involved in this, too, Mikhail Aleksandrovich. It would be good if Brokman sent a message to his boss. Right. - About what? That he was unlucky and didn't see Academician Nesterov. And that he can't remain in the country under these conditions. And so he leaves it, going the previously agreed-upon route. We need to find out about this route. I still remember how to operate the radio, but... the ciphers and the codes... surely they've been changed. And we don't know when the radio contact is due. Try to find it out. - Okay. By the way, it's mine. Utkin handed it over to Brokman. What about Mattinelli? - He went to the plant. Okay, let's talk? Dickheads. What fucking dickheads we are. Come on, you didn't get psycho when you wasted people. What people? - Want me to remind you? I lied, I made it up. - Made it up? What are you talking about, Misha? And about the old man whom you hit with a piece of iron on the temple, too? What old man? - Want to know his name? Aleksandr Tulyev, my father. I didn't know, Michele, I swear, it was an accident. Oh, Christ... - You recalled Christ too late. I haven't come to settle scores with you. Why don't you talk at the interrogation. I'm talking. - You don't confess to the main charge. I got nothing to confess. I've done nothing wrong in this country. Really? - Really. Who killed Kutepov? Kutepov.. Kutepov was a foe of the Soviet regime. Look at him, such a defender of its interests. It's a murder, like any other one. Give me a cigarette. I don't smoke. What do you want? How did you plan to get back abroad? Doesn't matter now. - Yes, it does. Can it ease my fate? If you stop playing the fool and start talking. The cipher. The time of the message. The place of the border crossing. Johann. Johann. What's up? Brokman was arrested in the Soviet Union. Are you sure? - Can't be more sure. Moscow even mentioned the place where he tried to cross the border. And Tulyev? - I'm talking about Brokman. Martha, let's go to Schwarzwald. For how long? - For good. We'll sell this villa, my folks have a chalet in the mountains. It's peaceful there. I'll be writing my memoirs. I don't want them to do to me what they've done to Stevenson. Thank you. And as who will I go with you? As my assistant. I guess I couldn't expect more. Martha, you know that I haven't filed for a divorce yet. Johann, I think you'd better go there alone. I think it's totally unreasonable if you go back there. God knows if your boss will believe our version of Brokman's arrest while his crossing the border or not. But you shouldn't risk it. What are you thinking about? I've been looking at this guy fishing there and recalled my dad. All his life the old man dreamt of going fishing with a line and catching a Russian perch. It didn't work out that way. Alright, and what am I going to do here? You did all you could there. You'll have tons of work here too. You'll spend more time with your family, besides, you're not so young anymore. Not so young? And how old are you - Old enough. But still? - 10 years younger. Really? Let's run to that bank. Okay? There and back? - Right. Okay. Let's do it. - Years are not an old age. Hey, you! You'll scare off all the fish here. Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, we proceed with our press-conference. You're welcome to ask your questions. Sergey Dmitriyev, Novosti News Agency. In its recently published statement, TASS claims that the foreign intelligence is carrying out an operation under the codename "Map". General, could you please specify the target of this operation? Okay. Here, in all inhabited areas of huge industrial centers, we marked stashes with highly virulent toxic substances. The whole network, and on these photos we marked just some places, is brought into operation, one by one or simultaneously, by a command sent from outer space. It's being set up, or more correctly, was set up in case of warfare. I guess, from what I said you can figure out the target of this operation. James Kening, Washington Morning News How did you get this map? I guess, the man who got it can answer this question better than me. Invite him here, please. Mikhail Aleksandrovich Tulyev. Mister King. Hi, I guess we've already met. Sit down. Mikhail Aleksandrovich. As Mister King, who brought up this question, left the room, this question is withdrawn. We still would like to hear how you got this map. Let it be my little secret. But to make up for your disappointment I'll show you. One highly confidential and important document for you. Here you go. Confidential. Of extreme significance. Operative plan # 10-1 of the special operative group commander in Europe. Target. Special missions across the USSR with the use of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, as well as means of psychological warfare. Time. Prior to and at early stages of the local and total war. I got these instructions courtesy of... ﻿the CIA secret agent Robert Stevenson. A question to Mr. Tulyev. - Welcome. Are you an officer? If yes, what is your rank? Does it matter? But if it's interesting to you, you may congratulate me, I've been promoted. Are you married? Unfortunately, Miss. I've been married for 17 years. Have any kids? Yes, my son is finishing school this year. Welcome. Lyubomir Makovetsky, the Czechoslovakian paper Rude Pravo. Mister General, could you, within the permissible framework, outline the background of the operation, the ending of which we're witnessing here right now? It's a very long story, dating back over 15 years. And it started the day when a secret agent of a foreign intelligence, who'd been smuggled in our country under the name of Zarokov, was uncovered Aka Mikhail Aleksandrovich Tulyev, who you've just had the pleasure to meet.
