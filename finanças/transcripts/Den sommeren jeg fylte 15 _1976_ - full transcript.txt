Okay. Your shirt, that's packed. That's all. Oh! The warm sweater Aunt Linn knitted you for Christmas. It's probably too small for you. Your socks I packed too. Yes, and handkerchiefs! Don't forget them, for God's sake! And don't forget to use them! And again don't slam doors - Like you usually do at home. Uncle Kristen and Aunt Linn are not used to noise, you know. They have no children. Promise me, Peter. Carsten! Carsten! He has a train to catch in 45 minutes! - Yes, it's also not far. - It's 45 minutes to get there... - Yes, wait a minute, I'm not finished yet! - Well, of course, your business is more important! - Listen, don't bother me! - Yes, I don't care about your business. He'll be late for the train! Okay. Okay! Keep your hair on! Well, what kind of person! Well, ready? My boy! I'll miss you. It's true isn't it, Carsten? The house will seem empty. Enjoy yourself on me. - Bye then! - Later! Safe journey! In a minute, take a look at this little thing. It will be useful to you in the village. It's yours. Thank you very much! It's beautiful. And don't forget to write. At least sometimes. We'll also be wondering how you are doing. - It's been quite a while since you've visited the Fagerlunds. - Well yes. Two years. Oh, sure, you were there the year before last year. Now I remember. Give them my regards. That summer I was 15 years old. I went to my Aunt Linn and Uncle Kristen Fagerlund. I'd been there many times before, when I was little. But that summer was special. I was invited there. But I could not shake off the thought, - - that it gave my father and mother some freedom. They had to solve their problems. And the best thing was to get rid of me.

I'll take your suitcase. - The machine over there. - Yeah. You're still driving the same green one? Yes the same good old wheelbarrow. Not so easy to get rid of it. She's just running like clockwork. But a bit unpredictable! So. Come on, climb in. - Well? How's life in the city? - Yes fine. - Greetings from my family. - Yeah thanks. So nice to come back to the village. Aunt Linn, Maria and... ...Maria... what's the matter? Maria no longer lives here, Peter. Is she no longer working...? She disappeared. - Hi! - Hi! How you've grown! Is everything fine? We're a little late. Come on, I'll take it. Well how are you? All is well? Let's eat properly, Peter. Thank you, but I... Perhaps you want a dessert? Porridge prunes! Thank you, thank you. Did he say anything about Maria...? No. Just said she... disappeared. Isn't that awful? Three weeks ago, she disappeared. Come on, have some cream. We had the police here. We searched everywhere. She was happy. Don't get upset, do you remember? Everyone's convinced she ran into the woods. Maybe wandered into the swamp?.. She could have run away while you were out. Yes. Maybe. Let's eat up. Peter? Mmm? - Promise me one thing. - What? That you do not pay attention to all the gossip. It's true that people are talking. You'll be fine here. Well, it would be time to visit the small lodge. - Don't you go there rather often? - Well, and who else would bring the milk to her? - Yes, you drag yourself there every evening. - Linn... Go, go. You're worse than the noisy women in the market! Are you going, Peter? Thanks for the treat! You... you taking him with you? Yeah, you know, we're agreed, that Peter will live alone in the annexe. Are you going to sleep there alone, Peter? I've put you in the bunk bed as usual. - But... - Of course, he will live separately. Like all lads, as they get older. Well, make yourself feel at home, Peter. Aunt Linn will bring you the bed sheets. - And if not, you'll get them yourself. Why? - Well yes. - Good night. - Good night. Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Hey Jo! Come here! - Hi! - Hi! - Wow! Do you live here? - Well yes. - Are you going to live here all Summer? - Oh sure. - I'm almost an adult, and you? - Me too. You should have seen what was on last week. The cinema showed a dancer. - Did you see her? - No. She danced in a transparent dress. Almost nothing on at all. - Have you read "Lady Chatterley's Lover"? - No. But look what I've got. "And here I am with my boyfriend!" "I'm just crazy about him!" Oh, you naughty boy! Where are you going? Wait, I'm asking you a question! - Not like that! - Yes, everything is fine. Come on, you try. No, hold it properly. Like this. And take aim. Come on! - No... - Oh shit. Come on, I'll show you. Wait a second. One more time? Op! Oh my God. You're absolutely crazy? You know, we'll try a new blade Peter. - All right, let's eat. - The first wafer - Peter. - Do you want jam on it? - And do you want a lot? Oh, totally! Here, Peter. Oh yeah. Ouch, I've cut myself. Well, shall we mix blood? - Then we will be brothers forever! - Yes, calm down will you! - I'll fetch a plaster. - No, sit down. Look, Linn, you're not afraid of blood? Remember how you fetched me from the woods when I slashed himself on the leg? You remember, right? What, you don't remember? How you looked after me then? You couldn't forget about it! My God, Kristen, it was so long ago! And I remember it very well, Linn. Kristen, you're dripping on the tablecloth! Come on, don't worry. And didn't you find any letter? Often people who run away leave a note. No, from her there was nothing. If I ever wrote a line... No, not even any little notes. I've already searched everywhere. And nobody knows anything. Okay, enough of that. - And you don't think of me at all! - You don't know what you're talking about! - You just can't wait to see her! - No, you're wrong! And aren't you ashamed in front of Peter! No, nothing like that! Dont touch me! Go away! Linn! Calm down! - What do you want, eh? - Linn! Open the door! - What's up with you? - I don't want you starting like this! And what's wrong? What happened? Get out of here! Why do you come to me? Come on, go! Go to this... Linn... Just look! Wow! Oh damn, those boobs! - That's how she looks! - Who? The one who lives in the Vesselya house! - You've seen her! - There is something to see! She's bringing up a baby. - Do you know her? - Yes. I know my sister Gerd. She looks like this. Oh my God! She's dreaming. Beautiful. Dreaming about guys. Boys - this is her dream come true. - Oh, Gee! - And they're all like that! I'll give it to you. On one condition. - At what? - That you teach me how to waltz. Leg forward... right back... So, come on... Like this... So. So... So. Good... Follow my movements! - I know something. - What do you know? - About your uncle. - And what do you know about him? And it is none of your business. - Come on, tell me. - I'll tell you if you return the magazine. Okay. Well? He had an affair with Maria. - Bullshit! - Yes, everyone knows about it! - Everyone's lying! - But they can't all be lying! - You're just a gossipmonger! - Oh you... Shit! Ouch! Do you hear? Your uncle had an affair with Maria! And he knocked her up! - Did you see Jo today? - Yes, we had an argument. - Something happened? - No. I think you have to make it up. Yes, he's just an asshole. But he is your only friend, Peter. - Hi! - Hi. Is Jo at home? No, he's with his father in the woods. - Okay. - Hey? - Huh? - I know someone who knows you. - Knows me? - Yes. Cathrine. She lives in the small Vesselya house. She said she knows someone, who studies with you in the same school. Yes, but... she doesn't know what school I go to. Well... I told her. Is anything wrong with that? No, it's all right. Cathrine - she's a super girl. - You know what she said? - No. She said if you want to visit her - Then you can just stop by sometime. - Me? - Well yes. Once you get to know her. I bet that will be very nice. Well I don't know. I'll drop by sometime. Thanks for the food. Well, I'll take the milk and go. Maybe Peter can take it today? - Me? - Well yes. You don't mind, do you Peter? No, I can go. Well, let's go. Do you remember the way? Come in. I don't know, Cathrine home? That's me. And you, Peter? Yes. I brought the milk. Great! Thank you. Come, sit down. And I'll be back soon, just look in the kitchen. Have a cigarette. Thanks, but... What, never tried it? Yes I have, but... I stopped. You're here for all the summer? Yes, all the holidays. And you? I don't know. - I made coffee, do you have sugar and cream? - Yes thanks a lot. God, here there's absolutely nothing to do. I'm dying of boredom. You too? Me? No. I have a loads of interests. Really? And what do you do? I'm learning about all the insects that exist in nature. - Insects? - Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I think insects are a lot more interesting than we humans. They are much stronger when you consider... their size... They are much better than us at doing a lot of things. - And you know what? - What? Each person has their insect. - Do you really think so? - Yes. Each person fits some insect. And so what is yours? Mine? I am a spider. - Come on! - Spider - it's just super-bug. Which can spin webs! You can catch things much bigger than yourself! And besides weave a network of webs in the air! - Ha ha, well, aren't you the dreamer! - Uncle Kristen! You know what he is? Something great, good and... Dung-beetle. Anyone who delves into the ground, he's big and strong... Well, what am I? I don't know. Maybe a butterfly? Butterfly? Well yes. I think you're a butterfly. But maybe I'm a nocturnal moth. "Bird"? So... "Bird". I have triple points. - Triple? - Oh, double. Sorry. Well, it's not much. Yeah. Two... two... four... - Ten points. - Ten points. That leaves me nothing. D... Listen, Cathrine? Why were you sent here? You wouldn't have to live here alone. With Henriette. I mean, he was married. ...Her father. So that... There was a scandal. You know how people behave. They only know how to read morality. And my mother and father decided that - It was best to send me to the village After all this commotion. So I'm sitting here in this house and bored. Well, you stopped by for a visit. You see, look how time flies! It's evening, so it's time... - I think tomorrow I'll come. - You'll come? Only don't forget the bucket! - So, will you be coming back in? - Well, if you have the time then... Wow, how are you busy! I thought a little hunting, shooting birds. Hunting - it's so cool! And fishing. Today I caught such a big fish here. Well, come in, if you have time. - Bye then. - Later. Try not to forget what I asked for. The coil of black threads, a pound of coffee and pay for the radio. Yes Yes Yes Yes. Bye then! He had an affair with Maria. Everybody knows about it. Hello! Hey, tell me what you saw? Again-again-again... Normally, yes? Did you go in the house? Tell me, what happened? - Well... there... - was a little kissing and generally... Did you touch her boobs? Did she allow you to touch? Really? Well, not exactly... But you and her hooked up? But what does that matter? How couldn't you? She has a child already! Well, you're a plank! Faggot! Will you shut up! You... gay... Come on, try hard, tell me again! She lived in an orphanage. No she had no mother, no father, you know? And me and Uncle Christen have no children so that... We were quite pleased to take care of her. Although she was no longer a child. Well yes. You know, she was so kind. And how old was she when she came here? 13-14 years, I think. I miss her terribly, you have no idea. Come along with me. Well, somebody's been here? It wasn't me. Perhaps Maria was here and rummaged through her things. And you? You yourself, what were you doing here? Yes, just drop in. Maria often said - That something needed to be repaired. Peter! Where are you going? Peter! Peter, come to me! Peter, let's go play! Let's go! Peter! So, let's see... Here. Maybe that's it? You must be absolutely crazy with boredom, buying some toys? - It's not for me. Uncle Kristen asked me to buy... - I think he's got a use for it. He said it was a gift. And, well, I know who it is. Excellent choice, yeah. Fucking idiot! It's probably, Auge Brenden. He was a lover of Maria, before she disappeared. - Oh! Really? - Some people say, they got engaged. Heck! - Peter, can you help me a little? - Yes. Can you fix this thing? Well yes. So... So, let's see... It needs replacing. And what are you going to do, when school is over? Continue to learn, I guess. - Maybe I'll be a doctor or an engineer? - Well, what about you? I want to be a flight attendant. You know what Jo says? - No. - I am too flat. What do you think, Peter? Am I flat? Well, I don't know. Touch. Just touch them. Come on, I'll let you. Are they big enough? Nobody has such beautiful hands as you. Nothing is wrong with that. - Oh my God! - You'll remember this in the winter! Well yes! And yet you have such long eyelashes. I've never seen this on boys before. Nobody has such beautiful hands as you. And yet you have such long eyelashes. I've never seen this on boys before. Like this... Hey! Peter? Hello! Do you want to sunbathe with us? No... I'm catching fish. Well, I see. There are even better places a little further away. - What? I said there are even better places not far away. Do you happen to have lost a duck? Oh, how beautiful! I'll be back, Henrietta. Where did you find her? Yes, sailed down from somewhere. Ouch! "Sailed"... It's great that you found her. Henrietta loves her so. - You are welcome. - Thank you! - Bye then. - Later! Henrietta, I'm on my way! Dear Mom and Dad! Everything is perfect. Come in! - Who's there? - This is Cathrine. It's the truth! Otherwise, I wouldn't say it! They were there together! Sat there completely naked! - And you saw it? - Of course I saw it! - And at the top and bottom? - Yeah! Holy shit! And then she stood up. I could see everything that I wanted. - That hussy! - And there's probably more to come. I have to see this! Well, how about we go swimming? Well... I have no swimming trunks with me. Come on, you're a man! Come on. - Are you going, Peter? - Well yes. And you? No. Peter! Give me the knife! ...She was under the water. She was caught in the reeds, I had to cut - her dress. We'll need to inform the police. I dropped your knife, I'll buy you a new one. From dust you came. And to dust you will return. And from the ashes will arise again. And now we'll sing Hymn 865... - You know what I heard? - No. - That she was three months gone. - Who? Maria. - You should visit us more often, Gerd. - So many dishes to wipe. Well, when there's something to do. I will do the rest, you can go. Thanks for the help. It's my pleasure. So, So, all done. Did you see where Peter went? - No, he's... probably gone somewhere. - Yes, exactly, he's not at home. It is very nice of you to help. Thank you so much. - Bye. - Pleasure! - Where did you come from? - From the woods. Just I decided to take a walk. It is true that you live alone in the annex? - Yeah. - That's so cool! Maybe you want to see how I live? - Great idea! - Of course! Come on! Here, here. Come on, keep walking... I feel ugly as a sea troll. Today. Come on... I can't. I have these... you know... - What? - Periods, right now! Sorry. Yes, it's not scary. It'll soon pass. And you're perfectly settled here. Well, it's good here. You know that in this house is where Mary and Auge Brenden used to meet? - Thanks for walking me home. - Yes, not at all. - Well, I'll go. - Later. Later! So, okay... So, all right... You were so good! - Come to me... - No I can't! I just think... I only live for you. - You always say that. - I'm serious. - And what about Linn? - Who's Linn... I don't think about Linn, but about you. Please stay... Come on one more minute! One more minute! "My dear Kristen!" "I got into a hopeless situation". "It's me who is to blame". "I tried to find a way out, but it was useless ". "If you meet Auge, do not tell him about this letter ". "He knows everything he needs to know". "Farewell, Kristen". "Goodbye. You were like a father to me". "But it was not enough. For me, at least ". "Perhaps now you understand". "I do not want anyone hurt". "It would be better for everyone if I disappear ". Linn! Linn! I cooked you breakfast! Probably she's become worse because of the news of Maria. And all these rumours... There is nothing worse. Give them a little hay, Peter. "You were like a father to me". "But it was not enough". "For me, at least ". - You don't have to do this, Linn. - This has to be done! - Or maybe you want to do it yourself? - No, no, this hasn't helped at all. But it's none of your business. - Do you want her to come to the party? - Who? - The one who lives in the Vesselya house? - Cathrine? Do you think she will come? Come on, it's time to go. - What are you looking at? - There's Cathrine. Which one? That one, with the blond hair. - That's the one? - Yes. - So go and dance with her! - Yah you! She's already taken! Yeah right, damn it. - Can I have a sip? - Who you? - Yeah. - Well, the kids of today! - How old are you? - 15. Soon. Well, shall we give him a treat? Okay, have a swig. He likes the city girl! Yes, all this nonsense! Nonsense? And that you saw her naked, is that nonsense too, perhaps? - He's going to dance with her. - Shut up! You going to or what? Well, you going to dance with her? Go on, man! Yes, no problem! Hello! Peter, are you drunk? - Shall we dance? - Yes, but... Come on, come on now. Isn't Cathrine beautiful? Look at her! Let's go. Excellent dance! Whore! No no! What the hell? Peter! - Give it to him! - Give him what he deserves! Let... Cathrine! I'm here. So you're after this girl? After this slut? Kristen! You're back already? Oh, Peter... Well, just look at you! What happened? - Yes, I got into a fight. - Oh my God! What was that about? The one called Cathrine... ...Whore. You shouldn't have interfered, Peter. And he pushed her so that she fell. There was no need for you to get involved. Come here a minute. They wanted to beat her. And then along came my uncle... Kristen? And he was there? Yes. He drove her home. - What are you talking about? - They already left a long time ago. No, not so long ago. Half an hour, I guess. No more than half an hour, for sure Maybe it was somewhere else he was going... Bang! - Where the hell was he going? - Going somewhere. Come in! Listen, I just decided to shave. - And you have never shaved... - No. I... saw you. At the party. And you didn't even approach, didn't invite me to dance. I'm sure that you dance much better than those louts. Well, I also saw a fight... It's horrible. Don't talk about it. Look, Peter. Do you think you could do something for me? Yes. What exactly? It's awfully hard to explain... You probably knew that... Kristen and I... we... ...we're in love. I know it's stupid, but... I promised myself that this never would happen again with married men. But it still happened. And this house... Do you think, could you lend it to me? Your aunt knows everything. She can't get me out of her head. You know, Peter, I want to to end it. But I just can't. And I just thought that... If we could meet here just the once... She would know nothing about it. And we would be able to finish it in an amicable way. Is that okay with you, Peter? Just the once! It would be so wonderful you know? You understand? - Of course, the house at your disposal. - Thank you! But on one condition. That on Wednesday you come to my Birthday Party. - I will be 15. - Birthday! - But is that possible?... - Come on. I told Jo that you would come. I'll be there. Peter... Peter... Peter... Peter... "Mrs. Linn Fagerlund" - One stamp please. - No problem. I'll stick it for you. So, raise your nose... - Ouch! - Calm down! I'm not going to hurt you. Keep your head straight. So... And now here we go. So... Like that, yes? You can't be unshaven on your birthday after all? So, now try it yourself. No not like that! Like this. Down gently... Now everything is all right. You're getting too big to have a cake on your Birthday? No, cake - it's my favourite! I've also invited Cathrine. Yes? And is she going to come? - Of course she'll come. - Keep still, or I'll cut you! Hooray, you have a birthday today! You we want to congratulate you! - Well, Happy Birthday! - Thank you! Congratulations! Come on, open it. Thank you very much! That's really great! Hey! Come on, have this! - There! Here she comes! - Is it Cathrine? Super, I'm just going outside for a moment. - Hi. - Hi. Happy Birthday. Here's a small gift. - Aren't you going to see what it is. - Ah, yes. Olaf Bull. "Love" (poetry collection) Thank you. Aren't you going to invite your guest into the house, Peter? - Welcome. - Thank you. What a cute baby! Who's so beautiful then? Here. I love sausages. Yes we all love them here. - Help yourself. - You are welcome! Sausages! Have some gravy. Yes, you're right, you're quite right. It's much better with gravy. Come on, I'll have some. Peter! Well, how does it feel to be fifteen? Yes, same as usual. Well, what can I say? I'll be forty soon. And I feel twenty. - Really? - Yes, to be honest. Come on, I'll pour. I remember when I was 15, I wanted to be a sailor. Perhaps, like your father, Peter. But he eventually wanted to study, become a genius. And I wanted to see the world. Everybody just laughed, no one believed me. So I packed my things and left. And so, therefore... I managed to walk most of the way to the city. Because there, I knew I could achieve something. And then I spoke with the chief in his office. He was very nice, by the way. He asked me my name and where I lived. And then he asked if my parents knew where I was. "Yes, yes, yes, of course" - I said. "Everyone knows about it!" Well, and then I had to stay there and wait. They had to check something. And so I sat there and sat there. Languished there for several hours. But I was patient. Evening eventually came... I don't remember how long I was there. And just as I was about to leave... just then... the door opened. - And standing there was... guess who? - Your father? Exactly. There was my father. So, while I was sitting there - in the office I told him everything. So he rushed back - - At full speed. Imagine just what an outrage there was. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! I've got two letters for you. - At your service! - Thank you! - Can I do something to help? - No, I can manage. Here's a letter for you. Oh, it's from Mom and Dad! - Gosh, we're moving! - How interesting! I hope the new place will be good. Come on, let's go back into the dining room. Well? Anyone want seconds? "To: Lynn Fagerlund" - Come on, show me. - Yes, she'll manage to eat without teeth quite easily. Maybe she wants more? - Shh! I think she was almost asleep. - Yes exactly. And how much did you eat? - Three pieces! - Wow! - Three pieces! - Oh my God! - No! Let's play hide and seek! - Hide and seek? Thank you for the cake, it was delicious! Jo, you can be "it"! Come on! I'll take the rest of the cake. - One, two, three, four, five... - Hey, no peeping! 18, 19, 20... Hey, Cathrine! I know a place... Wait a bit, I need to go into the bushes. - Maybe I'll hide in the hay-loft? - Come on! Coming, ready or not! Anyone not hidden - just stand still! Hey! Cathrine, is that you? It's only me! Quiet! It's them! - Shouldn't they be ashamed? - Yes, they have got all summer... She's completely lost her head. She tried to end it, but... She couldn't. Damn, I've looked everywhere! You are so hot... Oh... my! Let him go, you jerk! Peter! Have you seen Kristen? - Kristen! - No, wait! Don't go in there! Oh, Peter, you're back! You think... What happened to you? You had a good trip? Hello! Yes it's me. Hello! Is that you, Kristen? Yes, he's here. Just came in. No... no, why? Something happened? Something to Linn? Yes Yes. Sometimes there are problems. But I hope it all works out! Oh I understand. No no. No, he left. He needed some time alone. He's in the neurological clinic. If you must know! I don't think we should speak about these problems right now. To tell the truth, Kristen, I am in total shock. Do you know... Hello? Hello? You're back! Anyway, it's very good that you're back home. - You are so like your father! - And what, is he very sick? No, he'll be back in a few days. By the way, we've got something for you... And where have all my bags got to? Because of this moving... Ah, it seems to be there. Happy Birthday, Peter. - Thank you so much! - Wear it for good health. It's beautiful. - Really? Maybe you will wind it up? Subtitles edited by catweasel, EU Torrents, 2016
