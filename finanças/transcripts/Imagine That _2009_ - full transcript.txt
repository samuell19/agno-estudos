Mr. Danielson? Oh... He took my blanket! Okay, everybody calm down! You'll get your blanket! It's mine! Legally, it's mine! It's mine! Ah! Nice, Evan. Really nice. Evan, get help. Get help! I don't need help! What I need is my blanket! You crazy! I am not crazy! I want my Goo-Gaa! I want my Goo-Gaa! He wasn't always this way. Once upon a time, he was a King. The King of Somewhere. Strong and powerful. What I'm suggesting is you reallocate eight percent of your equity to international markets. He protected his loyal subjects and made them feel safe. All right, are you looking at the charts? These are actually very conservative projections. Yes, they are. But he left his kingdom and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere. Something no one could have ever imagined. ♪ I was alone, I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there ♪ ♪ Another road where maybe I could see ♪ ♪ Another kind of mind there ♪ ♪ Ooh then I suddenly see you ♪ ♪ Every single day of my life ♪ ♪ Got to get you into my life ♪ ♪ Into my life ♪ ♪ Got to get you into my life ♪ ♪ Into my life ♪ ♪ Get you into my life ♪ In Nowhere Land, everybody wanted to be king. Or at least they all tried to be. Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather. You got a what? A feather on my desk with a note attached. From Johnny Whitefeather? What'd the note say? Yup. "I'll be at your 9am. See you in there. Ain't nothin' but a thing." Wow. Then the rumor must be true. What? What rumor? Stevens is cashing in. What? He's selling the company?! He has to be. His replacement's gonna be me or Johnny! You're gonna get this job! Hey, good morning! Good morning, Mr. Danielson. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Danielson. It was a very strange place. They've narrowed it down to our firm and two others. It is confirmed. Whitefeather is gonna be in the meeting. The king was really unhappy there, he just couldn't figure out why. Hey, Tod! What's up, Mr. D? Take this down to Graphics and add to my chart. Right after I... Now. What about the...? Hey, "Now" now, man. What's up? How much are we paying that guy? He's an unpaid intern. I think it was because he was always working to protect his castle from those who wanted to steal his crown. Johnny Whitefeather. Evan Danielson. Fellow salmon swimming upstream. After you, Sir. Thank you. So those of us he left behind went out into the land to rescue him. Whip, I said I'd sit you down with our two best financial managers. Evan's been our number one guy for the last eight and a half years. Johnny's been with us for 16 months, but he's already one of our top producers. Either way, you'll be well taken care of here at Smith Stevens. Evan? Mr. Bryson. You've made some really sound investments, but I think we can do better. Let's see if you agree. Evan Danielson's office. Now this will give you a solid base of capital and a nine to 11 percent yield, annually. Yeah, I understand. Is it... His daughter? Did you call her mother? Because if I say it's urgent and he's really... Oh. The Goo-Gaa? Fantastic, Evan. Thank you, Tom. Johnny? Thank you, Tom. Whip? Dave, Lee, Troy. I see those looks of skepticism, just like old man Stevens, the first week that he hired me. Said to himself, "I hired an Indian. Can he handle money?" And how. Hey. I really appreciate you letting me contribute a little piece of venison to your potlatch. Okay. We're here under one sky. All of us, under one sky. Let's appreciate that. One sky. Evan Danielson: That man over there is a seer. Uses the whole eye. But there is a difference between sight... And vision. Sight is about what lies just in front of us. Vision is about what lies ahead. The genius of the hawk... Uh... Excuse me. Johnny, sorry to interrupt one of your always interesting stories about nature. But gentlemen, I'm going to have to leave you, Mr. Bryson in the very capable hands of my colleague, Mr. Noah Kulick. I have a family emergency at my daughter's school I have to take care of. Thank you for your time, Sir. That's what we're all talking about: Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life. Oh, yeah. Hakuna matata. I'm so sorry. The school kept calling. Don't tell me, the Goo-Gaa? Yeah. I hate that blanket! We don't normally allow any kind of security items at school. But because of yours and Trish's separation, we made a temporary exception. Unfortunately, it's just not workable anymore. Hey, you guys. This is why I was called out of work? My daughter's by herself at recess? No, the reason I called you, Mr. Danielson, is because her class went inside 45 minutes ago. She's still sitting here because "Koopida and Moppida" told her to. Koopida and Moppida are her... I know. I've... Imaginary friends. I told Trish we'll have to do something about that blanket. Trish and I discussed this and we both feel what needs to be dealt with is the reason why she still feels she needs a blanket. It's usually an indication of some kind of emotional needs that haven't been met. (Muttering) Sometimes these things are like a Band-Aid. You just have to rip it off. Right. Rip it. Uh-huh. Rip. Koopida, shh! I can't hear you both at the same time. Go ahead, Moppida. Shh. Wait. Wait a minute. Someone's coming. Hey, Liv. Hi, Daddy. Hey, Baby. Remember we talked about how the day was gonna come when you couldn't take the Goo-Gaa to school with you anymore? Well, that day is gonna be today. So, what Daddy's gonna do is take the Goo-Gaa and hold onto it for you. When you get home from school, you'll get it back, all right? All right. So just give me the Goo-Gaa. You have a great day. All right, Baby. As you know, the Mile High City Arts Council relies solely on contributions. Yeah. I've got 12 people and four desks. We need your money. Mr. Cosgrove, can I call you right back? Trish, please, this is a really bad week. Evan, I told you three months ago that this was pledge week. That's this week? Yes. You promised me you would do this. You promised me. Look, Evan, I know you and her haven't ever... Trish, please, not this week. I'm begging you! Had a chance to connect. Can we flip-flop and I'll do it next week? No! I promise you! No, Evan. Even if I could, I wouldn't. Evan, why did you tell me you even wanted to have children? Because I did. I do! I just didn't know I'd be so bad at it. You know, Evan, you're a really smart guy. You make huge deals every day. I'm sure you'll find a way to deal with her. Sweetie? Yeah? You're gonna go with Daddy, okay? Okay. He's so excited. And I'm gonna call you every night to say good night. Promise? You'll be fine. It'll be fun. I love you. I love you, too. Okay, here we go. You're a competitive guy. That's intimidating, especially in a father figure. First of all, I'm not her "Father figure." I'm her father. She's the one that's intimidating. What? Honestly! She just stares at me! Or through me! She's got this imaginary world she goes to with Kapida and Kapuda and Zoopida... I don't get it. I'm gonna put this as gently as possible, okay? You're a complete idiot. You feel out of control and you project that onto her. Hey, look, man. Be my friend and be my client, but don't be Mr. "Mystic Man" or whatever you call yourself. Man Whisperer. The Man Whisperer. John Strother, former cornerback for the Denver Broncos, is now known as "The Man Whisperer." Right. You be whispering to men. Psst! All I'm saying is we have a little kid inside, right here. Hey! And he's whispering. Stop. Please stop. You don't whisper to little Evan, you'll never get through to Olivia! I'm not whispering with you. You just did. No, I wasn't whispering with you. I was... The other you finished talking. Then I said whisper after. I wasn't whispering with you. What's wrong with little Evan? Say "Whisper to little Evan" one more time. Say it again. Know what's gonna happen? What you gonna do? I'm gonna crash your portfolio. What's that have to do...? Ha-ha-ha. Hey, Baby. Hey. Mmm. You wear him out? No, but Olivia will. Where they at? Upstairs. Princess dress-up. What?! They started without me?! Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs. Thanks for watching her. Absolutely. Any time. Oh, and Trish told me to remind you, vaccinations on Thursday. And Ella's party is Friday. It's a sleepover here, so pack all of her stuff. And the Fall Sing is Saturday. Livvy's really nervous, so go through her songs with her. She doesn't think I'll remember all this, does she? No. She does not. Hmm? Oh, no. Come on, guys. More! I want to be beautiful! Hey, Ev. I got the perfect size seat for little Evan. Come on, sit down. I think I'm fine. I'm okay. Come on, Liv, let's go. We got to go. Bye, Olivia. Bye, Ella. Bye, Liv. Bye. Denver Broncos, huh? No, Moppida, I can't go. No. Well, yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Are you sure, Moppida? Okay, if you say so. What? He actually had a snake? A real snake? If people are going to fall for this whole shtick, we gotta find a better way to do this, all right? No, listen. Here's what we're gonna do: We're gonna eliminate TriTek. No, no, no. I'm looking at the specs and I don't like what I see. First... Hold on a second. Olivia, what are you doing? Go back to bed. You said you'd be a king. I said I'd do what? You said last time that next time you'd do dress up and you'd be a king. I don't recall saying that. I don't remember saying that. Even if I did, I don't have the right stuff to do king stuff here. I don't have any king clothes and I don't have a king hat. It's called a crown. What... Hold on a second. Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed. I wanna sleep in here. You're sleeping in your room. That's why you have a bedroom. Go sleep in your bedroom. I do not want to sleep in there. All right. You gonna go to sleep? You promise? Mm-hm. Okay, go over there and lay down. Be quiet. I gotta work here. I'm sorry, man. Where was I? Oh, this is where we're gonna snake Whitefeather. 'Cause he's thinking we'll go for the obvious play, Solocom. But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber. Digital Fiber is the play. That's the obvious choice. Stop saying... Hold on a second. (Whispering) Olivia. What? Yeah. Sorry about that, man. Look. No, no. Shh! You gotta be quiet. It's his job, not yours. (Whispering) Can I call you back? Thank you. All right, that's it. Now I asked you to be quiet, but you don't listen. Yes, I do. No, you don't. I asked you not to talk, but you kept talking. You don't know how to listen, so since you don't know how you take your blanket and go in your room. Go. Come on, now. Come on, really. Please. Come on, I'm saying "Please". Go to bed, please. Now what? What is it? Look, I told you, I will play king with you some other time. Daddy has a lot of work to do, so... What?! I do listen. Um... I'm sorry. How many days till I go back home? I've gone over everything we talked about and it all looks great. It's perfect. Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom. Of course. We got a better alternative: Digital Fiber. Exactly. I'll call you in 20 minutes, right after I drop Olivia off at school. All right. Okay. Come on, Honey, let's go. Daddy's sort of in a hurry. I think this milk is spoiled. No, not possible because I checked the milk. Let's go! What if we say we just get a muffin, huh? Tomorrow, can we make pancakes? Honey, I don't have the right stuff for that, supply-wise or skill-wise. I can help you. I got a better idea. Leave a note for Graciela, she can make pancakes, put them in the freezer, we'll eat them tomorrow. Yeah. Not what I was thinking. Move. Let's move! Hey. You didn't pack my Fall Sing music. (Muttering) Your Fall Sing... Where is it? Here it is. Right here, here's your music. Rick? I thought you said we were in a hurry. Yeah... I'm coming right now. Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough. Hey, does Mommy ever make a new friend? You know, and like... You mean Rick? Yes, Rick. Is that the guy from Mommy's work, with the spiked hair and pointed face? "Hello, I'd like to talk to you for a second." That guy? No, that's Skip. Rick is tall. Handsome, too. He looks like Prince Charming. Oh. That's good for Rick. Ah. Morning, Graciela. Morning, Mr. Danielson. Hi, Graciela. Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you. Hey! Graciela! One thing. Can you please make some pancakes and put them in the freezer? (Spanish) Thank you so much. All right. Hey. What are you, a button maniac? Stop it. Press one floor, leave it alone. Daddy? Mm-hm? Koopida wanted me to tell you something. Yeah? Go ahead. She heard what you were saying on the phone last night and she told me to tell you she doesn't like either of them. Which guy, Rick or Skip? The companies. Solocom and Digital Fiber. Koopida doesn't like them. Neither does Moppida. And Qwali agrees. Daddy, do you know why they don't like them? Daddy, I said, do you know why they don't like them? Why? Because they're broken. Do you know which one they do like? Honey, I have no idea. The first one, the one you threw away. TriTek. Huh? Are you sure you're listening? Yes, Daddy's sure he's listening, but we gotta go. Let's go. Koopida and Moppida really like it. You know why? Why is that? Because it has buried treasure. Oh yeah? Okay. You aren't listening. No, Daddy's listening. Okay, so we're here. And we're going in. And there's something you have to go without. Hey. Come on, Olivia, let's go. Hi, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Liv! How are you? Hi! Give me five. Put 'er there. Okay, guys, I got three meetings back to back. Sit here. Let's get settled down here. Let's get settled in. Mike, which one can I get rid of? Uh, well... That one. Don't say that one. That's sacrilege. That's Dante D'Enzo. We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo. Koopida says he's boring. Well, Koopida is a-stupid-a. He happens to be one of the greatest investors on the planet. No, he's boring. Why am I arguing with you about Koopida? Let me get something for you to watch. There you go. What's that? Barney? Look, can you watch my kid for me? Yeah, yeah. Watch Barney and I'll be... That's not Barney. That's Blue. And now I'm going to tap your knee very gently... Did you see that? By increasing your family's holdings in optical fiber. If you take a look at these charts on page six in your folders... Solocom looks solid. But if you pore over the financials, it's crystal clear the smart play here is Digital Fiber. (Whispers) Koopida says no. Okay. No! Let's move on Digital Fiber. I'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber? Oh no, yes, yes do go, yes. No. No? Yes. Yes, go, yes. Mother? Tom? Johnny? Perhaps you have something to add? Not really. It's good work from Evan. Digital Fiber. Solocom. I struggled with it myself last night. I went to sleep convinced I was gonna take the Pressman Family towards that pretty face: Solocom. But in the middle of the night, the dream sparrow comes to me. She taps me on the forehead and says, "Wake up, handsome brave. There's something happening in Uzbekistan." "Uzbeki-what? It's 4:30 in the morning, little friend. I'm sleeping." But she said there's a kalacampi. The worm hidden in the apple. And I let the dream sparrow fly away. But I investigated what she said on the white fire grid you people call the Internet. At 4:15 this morning, Mountain Standard Time, the Uzbeki government followed through on a series of threats to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom. Digital Fiber, Solocom, all of their underground cabling that they were relying upon, lost in that mushroom cloud. Do I blame Uzbekistan? No. Defend yourself, mountain republic, just like you said you would. You followed through. (Chant) But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan, a little company called TriTek didn't look like much to me yesterday. But today, their 6,000 miles of already buried underground cabling, looking a lot more valuable. TriTek, Baby. I say we go into TriTek. Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh? Evan, you mind if I sit in on your 11:00? Well, Johnny, that's not up to me. That's up to the client. So it's cool. Because I checked with the client, and they said it's okay. That's great. It's great. Hey, ain't nothin' but a thing. The herd moves on, but you're gonna be fine, little elk. You're gonna be just fine. One sky, man. Ah... One sky. One sky. I didn't realize you guys were so tight. You know what I want you to do for me? Go down to legal and check something out for me. I want to know what the ramifications are if I were to stab Johnny Whitefeather. Daddy! Not now, Sweetie. But Daddy! Not now. And listen to me, Liv. This is where Daddy works. You can't come down here and stand outside my meetings and flail your arms around. Rose! Yeah. Will you take Olivia downstairs and get her a muffin or something? Are you hungry, Honey? No. I don't think she's hungry. She's starving. I can see that. Come on. Here we go. Let's go get a muffin. Have some girl talk. Hey, Ev? Give me a second, Noah. I'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00. Actually, it pertains to the 11:00. Quickly, two things. First, um, Johnny has just asked me to join his tribe. I can't believe he actually calls his team a "Tribe." Yeah, it's stupid. And you said yes, didn't you? No, absolutely not, at first. But he put so much pressure on me. He needed an answer immediately. So... That's all well and good, Noah. Thanks for your loyalty. If you don't mind, I got to get ready in ten minutes, so if you'd... Oh. That's the other thing. The 11:00: Johnny moved it up. He had a conflict at 11. Johnny moved my meeting with my clients?! Yeah. It started at 10:30. So I popped in as a courtesy to you, because we were so tight for so long. Thank you so much for hiring me. Out! Okay, I gotta go. Rose! Where are my notes for the 11:00? Um, I think they're in there. They're not in there. Oh... Um... Mr. D, I talked to the lawyer guy upstairs and he confirmed my hunch. About the whole stabbing Mr. Whitefeather thing? It's a definite no-can-do from a legal standpoint. Go away, Tod. Go very far away. Yeah. Right. I can't find them. Well, they're here somewhere. I can't make it happen without my notes. Find my notes, please. Okay, okay. I'm late for a meeting I was early for in the first place. All right, we're gonna find them. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Did you draw on my worksheets? Qwali said I could. Qwali said you could? Let me tell you something. I'm going into a meeting where grown people will be judging Daddy, and my worksheets have pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff and... What is this, people kissing or something? Koopida says they might get married. And why is it sticky? Why is it so sticky? It's sparkle glue. Sparkly. This is a disaster. (Chanting) It's a horror show. (Chanting) (Chanting) Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala! I have never, guys, never felt so jazzed about the prospects of our pension fund! I mean it. I am jazzed! I wish I could take credit, Fred, but we got to give that to the walahala, Mr. Waterfall. Hey, rain down prosperity! And how. Thank you, Johnny! Oh, Evan. Uh... Everybody, you remember Evan Danielson. I would hope so, after seven years of working with you guys. Yeah, of course. How's it going there, Evan? Good to see you. Hey, look, while we were waiting for you, Mr. Whitefeather made some rather radical suggestions, as you can see. Yeah. So, what do you think, Evan? Do you agree with Mr. Whitefeather or do you have some special insight you'd like to share with us about how you would increase the fund? Um... I think I do have some insight. I don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather. Um... What I was gonna suggest was a four percent reallocation away from convertible arbitrage. And, uh... And, uh, in addition to... Uh... To that.... Okay. Good. Thank you. I don't know about you guys, but this is good for me. Hey, man. Sometimes, the best spear is the one you don't throw. Ain't nothin' but a thing. "Ain't nothin' but a thing." What does that even mean? It's not a thing, but it is? It's something, but it's not... A thing, but it's not. But it's something. What is it? I'm confused! What's that? You're a seeker, brother crow. You should ride that... Stop it right now. Stop it! I'm not gonna be subjected to your "Dr. Seuss meets Pocahontas" stuff today. One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky! Whoa. Evan, that's shadow time. Let's keep that in the shadows. Please, make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Lord! Lord! Make him stop, Lord! Why are you falling for this?! What's the matter? I've been working for you for seven years! You know that, Fred. I went to your grandson's birthday party! I went to Aspen with you and your wife! For the whole weekend! We got history together! You throw it away because this guy showed you some waterfall and got you chanting "Walla Walla"? Evan. We're always looking for fresh ideas and he showed us some. It's like Johnny says. You got turtles that live in their shell and turtles that live out of their shell. What? What did you just say? What did he say? What did he tell you? What? What was that? What'd he say? What? He said turtles with no shell... Called geckos, man. That's not even biology! How could you listen...? What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake? You want new ideas? Fresh, new ideas. Okay. Slow, predictable growth is so boring. Let's talk about a company called ChemStar. Let's talk about this company. I say go out and buy lots of it, buy lots and lots of ChemStar. You know why? Because it's sparkly. Everybody knows that everybody loves sparkly things, so go out and buy some ChemStar because it's sparkly! Here's fresh idea number two. These companies were so stinky, I had to snip them away. Snip, snip, snip. If you're not good, you got to go! Okay. Here's fresh, new idea number three! Look at that. YellowFin and Aerodyne. What are they doing? YellowFin and Aerodyne. They're kissing. And what does kissing usually lead to? Marriage! They're getting married! ♪ YellowFin and Aerodyne sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ ♪ First comes love Then comes marriage ♪ Evan. Stop. Don't stop me. I got more, Tom! Fresh, new idea number four. NeoDyne is your biggest holding, right? Six percent of your equity is in NeoDyne? Know what fresh thinking says about that company? Pull out! Pull out now. NeoDyne's about to have his pants pulled down and his underwear exposed. Know what's in those underwear? No. Poop. Poop's in the underwear. Poop. Nasty. Doo-doo. Stinky. Ca-ca. Here's a recap: NeoDyne, pants pulled down, butt exposed, poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky, ca-ca. Okay? Those are my fresh... You take this. Hold onto this. Those are my new ideas! Thank you so much! Rain down fresh ideas and Walla Walla! Did you tell them what Koopida said? Oh yeah, I sure did. Did they like it? I imagine it was a lot of fun to watch. Oh, God, what have I done? What have I done? Is everything okay? Hey, Ev? Stevens wants... To see... You. (Whispering) I don't know, he flipped out. He lost it, man. He lost it. Whatever you heard I said, it's probably a lot worse. I heard you said "Poop." Yeah, I said "Poop." Twice. Nice. I will be back in as much time as it officially takes to say, "You're fired", all right? Mm-hm. Evan, uh, what...? Tom, I don't know what... I'm still trying to process what just happened in there. So am I. Really, Tom. How did you know about all those things? Listen to me, Tom. There's absolute... What? The companies you said were kissing, AeroDyne and YellowFin. What did you mean by that? I just... My brother-in-law sits on the board of AeroDyne. For 18 months, they've been looking for a partner to offset their over seas debt. Of the literally 700 companies considered, there's only whose financials actually made sense. And that's YellowFin. How did you know about this impending marriage? I just, uh... Koopida said they might get married. ChemStar. You said to buy because it was... Sparkly. Yes? Uh, yeah, I... Okay... A data-wire came in during the meeting. During the meeting. "ChemStar finalizes plans to expand Bauxite Excavation in its New Guinea Mine. Stock up 18 percent." Bauxite. It's sparkle glue. Sparkly. NeoDyne. You said to get out. Do you remember why? Uh... Do you? Oh, yes. I wrote this down. Because... "Their pants were coming down, and everyone was going to see their underwear, which was filled with poop." Oh, yeah, I remember that. Lunchtime today, they were exposed by the SEC for corporate fraud. Pants pulled down. And their books? Total poop! So I'm asking you again. How did you know all this? Are you insider trading? Oh, no, Tom. No way, never. Then what are you doing? Where are you getting this information? So it's the Goo-Gaa? That's how I go there. What do you mean you go there? Go where? Where the princesses live. Right, the princesses. That's Koopida and Qwali and all of them, right? Qwali's a queen. Koopida, Moppida and Soppida are princesses. Okay, got ya. How many times do I have to tell ya? Right, right, and... Okay, let me get this right. Now, they tell you things about companies? Mm-hm. Know what? I got a couple other companies I want you to ask them about. Think they'll be up to that? You can do it yourself. I can ask them myself? I can go there with you? Yes, it'll be fun. Okay. A little more room here. Now I do what? Okay, hold it to your face. I take the Goo-Gaa. Hold it up to my face. And rub in little circles. Okay, little circles. Like this. Now you put it over your head, like this. Okay. Now what? You kind of call them in your mind while you spin in circles. Okay, so I call them in my mind while I spin in a circle? Yeah. Okay, spinning. I'm spinning. Keep spinning. Keep spinning. Okay, I'm spinning around. Are you calling them in your mind? Yeah. Am I supposed to just keep spinning around? Because I'm a tad bit nauseous now. Okay, we're there! Isn't it beautiful? Come on, Daddy! This way to the forest! Wow. The princesses sure live in a beautiful forest. No, because this part's all burnt. Oh, yeah, burnt from a big forest fire. No, Soppida's dragon burnt it all. Soppida has a dragon? Mm-hm. If you want to get past her, you have to sing a song she likes. I gotta sing a song to Soppida's dragon too? Mm-hm. Hurry! She's coming! She's coming where? Sing. Uh... Uh... ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ ♪ Soppida's dragon ♪ You gotta do better than that. ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ Try higher. ♪ Soppida's dragon, please let... ♪ Higher, like a mouse! You want me to have an aneurysm? ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ ♪ Ooh-hoo! ♪ She very hates that. Yeah, I'm with her. Try lower, like a frog. Okay, like a frog. ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ ♪ Soppida's dragon... ♪ She very likes that. She fell asleep. Come on, let's go. Now we can go through her cave. Duck! Going in the cave. It's a big, beautiful cave. No, it's tiny. Can't you see? Okay, my eyes are just adjusting still. Jump, Daddy, jump! Why am I jumping? Jump 'til you get in! Okay. Okay, you're in. Now you're out. What was I in? France! I was in France? Now we're on the beach. We're on the beach now. All right, great! Is it a nice beach? Uh-huh. Only because mermaids give us popcorn balls. Aw, that's so nice. Thank you for the popcorn balls! Oh, no! Someone's coming! Soppida, no! Soppida, you can't! Can't what? What's happening? What's going on?! She doesn't trust you! She's throwing rocks at you! Duck! Duck! I'm ducking! Why's she throwing rocks? Up the path! Go back down! This way. Okay. Okay, we made it. There they are. Hi, Koopida! Hi, Moppida! Hey. Say something nice. Hey, Koopida and Moppida, how are you? Good to see you. Uh... My name is Evan Danielson. I'm Olivia's dad. They already know who you are. Oh, okay. Um, it's good to see you. You look so nice and pretty. The two of you. Wow, you really outdid yourself today. I'm here to ask you... Uh, I was wondering... I was... Are you sure they're...? Yeah, they're watching. I was gonna... I have some, uh... I wanted to ask about, uh, magnesium futures and their relationship to Bolivian currency fluctuations. Specifically, these three companies: La Paz Ore and Iron and International Mining and Weston Metallurgy, Limited. Weston Metallurgy. These three. I wondered if you could... Can they see them? I don't want to be in your way. What are they doing? Are they talking? What are they talking about? Shh. They're talking. Really? Are you sure? Okay. Yes, no, no. Did they give a reason? Because it's "Fancy?" Exactly right, Sir. Fancy. But you're also saying, which strikes me as contradictory, we should abandon all interests in Western Metallurgy. That's correct. Because the Boliviano is gonna... What'd he say again? "Be a big, dumb showoff and fall off its bike." Uh, no. Trike. Nobody likes a big, dumb showoff. Well, no offense, but sounds to me like a load of what you just stepped in. That's why we brought Mr. Whitefeather. What you got, Son? Mr. Rowe. That's funny. A country's entire monetary system reduced to riding around on a tricycle. That's a laugh. It's good to laugh. It's good to laugh, man. But there's a time to be serious. We're out here in these holy mountains we call Rocky. They're full of predator and prey. The lion of the mountain knows when to pounce. Better watch out, jack-bunny. In life... Excuse me one moment. Yeah, okay. Love the new act, man. Fun character. Thank you. There's an old tribal saying: "It's not the paint that makes the warrior." What? Be well, brother. Be well. Evan, I ever tell you about Billy Littlesnake? Guy I used to go fishing with in Montana? I think you spared me that story. He'd go fishing where nobody else fished and always come back with ten fat trout. Turned out he was stopping off at the market and buying them. I'm not inside trading. Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into those woods, all right? A lot of bear in those woods. Listen. Stop that thing. If you're gonna talk to me, don't do that thing you do. You want me to speak directly? I can do that. Then do it. You want to run with me, then run with me. I accept the challenge. I welcome it. But if I find out you're stopping off at the market and buying your fat trout, I'm gonna scalp you. You're gonna scalp me. Literally? It's gonna feel literal, yeah. Nice chatting with you, Johnny. And you, Evan. Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay. Let me tell you something about Johnny Whitefeather. Under all the show, I'm good at what I do. I have a gift. I see trends. I see patterns. I see things no one else will ever see. Evan is good, but he's not that good. I want you to find out where he's getting his information. ♪ Soppida's dragon, please let me pass ♪ ♪ Soppida's dragon Please let me pass ♪ She's in a good mood tonight. That's great. We all are. Let's go through the cave! Get in the cave! Going through the cave and I'm ducking down! We're coming out in France. We're in France! Bonsoir! Bonsoir. Now we're back on the beach with Koopida and Moppida. Hello, Koopida and Moppida. How are the princesses today? They're good. They're good. That's great. Hold onto this for a second, Honey. Okay. Ladies, I want to talk to you about something. First, those gowns you're wearing look exquisite. They look exquisite, ladies. Um... I'll just go right out and say it. Am I looking in the right direction? Yeah. Okay. I have a potential client in the medical field and he has a particular company he was wondering if he should hold onto that company. I was wondering if you ladies had any feelings about that. The company is called VallaTech. I've been hearing incredible things about it. We were just wondering what you thought. What do they think? Maybe. Maybe? Because Koopida very liked it, and Moppida very hated it. Okay. So now what do we do? If they disagree, we have to see Qwali. But she's at her mountain castle. Okay, well. Where's the mountain castle? There. Does Qwali have to be out by this bridge in front of my building, all these people all over, where everybody can see us? We are not by a bridge. We are at the bottom of Qwali's mountain! There's no one here except you and me, and maybe Qwali, if she likes the way you dance. I have to dance for Qwali too? Yeah, because there's a ball tonight. And she has to see who is the best king. She will not talk until she does. Okay. Well, let's do a little dance for Qwali, then. Hey, Evan. What's going on, man? How you doing? Okay. How's that? Horrible. You have to get on that thing, so she can see you. Look, I'm not getting up on this stage, all right? She won't talk to you. Okay, I'm gonna go get up on this stage, here. Come on! She can't see that! She's way, way up there. All right, Okay. I'll just... Take it easy, here. More! Bigger! Huh? Like that? No? Yes? To the beat! Can't you hear the music?! To the beat? I don't hear the beat. I hear the snickers. It's spinning music! Spinning, with your arms out! You mean like a waltz? A waltz, you're talking about. Okay. That's the best I could do. No, it was good. She liked it. You can go to the ball! Okay, all right. Qwali said it was good. I can go to the ball. Now... Did you ask Qwali how she feels about VallaTech? Bottom line, VallaTech is stuck up and doesn't play nice with others. I say we cut it out. Oh, really? I know this sounds a little unorthodox, but here's something else you need to know... It has a big butt? A big ol' butt with a shelf on it. I think if you look at DarbaCon's bloated end-of-the-year rollover... You'll see it has pretty hair and all the boys are looking at it. If he said it wets the bed, then it wets the bed. Uh, what else did he say? This little company goes wee-wee-wee all the way home. Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee?" Yes. "All the way home." And people are buying that? By the millions. Icky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky. Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic? Not that I'm aware of. It's fizzy, like soda pop. Is he a psychic? No, I don't believe he is. It's old enough to start wearing makeup. Ready for makeup. You feelin' this? He says your funds are mature. It's time to start diversifying. Specifically for A.I., what I'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini. I'm feelin' that. I want some of that. Back off, dawg. It's mine. Whoa, whoa, whoa! There's enough lip gloss to go around for everybody. "Agroco is a crybaby who always goes running to Mommy." That's your analysis. Yes, it is. And you recommend I...? Sell. Sell the crybaby. Sell the crybaby. Is this some kind of joke, Tom? No, Carl, it's not. Because it seems... I know, a little different. A little? Why don't we what Mr. Whitefeather has to say. Yes, Johnny, would you like to toss a spear at some tatonka, or cast some venison into the potlatch? No, I wouldn't. I'd like to take this seriously. There's a great deal of money at stake here, Mr. Simmons. I think you should move forward on Agroco, aggressively. Increase your holdings. And a gentleman by the name of Dante D'Enzo happens to concur with my position. His company, D.D.E. Investments, is looking to increase their holdings by 25 percent. So if we're gonna make a move, we have to do it rather quickly. If you're ready, I'm ready. Let's make some money. That's "My venison". Evan? Your thoughts? I think that's interesting. That's very interesting. Very, very, very interesting that Dante D'Enzo would say in and I would say out. That's interesting, I think. What I'm gonna do now is go to the restroom and think this through, re-crunch some numbers and get right back to you. Excuse me. So... Evan? Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? We're dropping off flyers for Saturday, the Fall Sing. We're on lunch, so I dropped them off. How you doing? I'm Rick. Oh, Rick. Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten. So you're Rick, you're the sculpture... Sculptor. I saw your little thing you did at the Comerica building. Metallic and pointy. And unfairly criticized, I might add. I got some last-minute parenting thing to do with Olivia. Nice meeting you, Rick. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. It's Mr. Danielson. Can I talk to Olivia? I'll be brief. Olivia, come talk to Daddy. Hi, everybody. I have some quick questions for Qwali about Agroco. Where should we go? Come on. Did you bring the Goo-Gaa? Okay. I knew you would. Perfect. Blanket up. Move in circles. I smell something burning. It's Soppida's dragon! Here she is! Moppida and Koopida! Good to see ya! Time to dance! What are they doing? I have no idea. She's really sure? And she says do you agree with her? I do? Don't you? Yeah, I guess I do, sort of. Okay. Okay, gimme a high five. Wish me luck. Good luck. Put this back in. Tell no one! So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo is totally wrong on this. Yes. And your inner child says that we should completely pull out of Agroco. Yes. Okay. Uh... I think I am going to go with what Mr. Whitefeather has put together here. It seems... Better. I am going to have the venison. It's a savory meat. I know you say Qwali's never wrong, but I think we both were this time. If just Moppida says it or just Koopida says it, it could be wrong. But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong. Well, I think she kinda was wrong this time. She was not. Yes, she was. Was not. Yes, she was. Not. Actually, not. Ha-ha. You're trying to get me to say "Was". No, she really wasn't wrong. D'Enzo pulled out of Agroco, which is down 12 percent. "Agroco cries foul, hides behind parent company." Crybaby runs to Mommy. How are you doing this? It's easy. Just overlap them and it makes a pyramid. Olivia? We're ready for you, Sweetie. Time for your shot. You did a really good job in there. I'm really proud of you. For that, we get a special ice cream treat. I cried, though. But you did good. When I was your age getting a shot, I'd start screaming, "Don't stab me!" No, you wouldn't. "Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!" What can I get you? Can we get two juice bars? Who wants pancakes? I do. ♪ Here comes the sun Doo-doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Here comes the sun and I say ♪ ♪ It's all right ♪ That's what I say. ♪ Little darling ♪ ♪ It's been a long, cold, lonely winter ♪ ♪ Little darling ♪ No, we're not going to pour it yet.

Restaurant? What restaurant? Mmm. Allow me to tell you the specials. Oh, please do. Pancakes. Oh! We have kind of burnt pancakes and really burnt pancakes. Oh. How much for the regular? Oh. Let me see. Three thousand dollars. And how much for the kind of burnt? Forty-seven cents. Okay, let me have two kind of burnts, please. Perfect. Do we have any condiments? What do you mean by that? You know, like syrup or some honey or jelly. Oh. Some... Anything that might cut the taste a bit. Ketchup. Mmm. Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce. And mustard. I would have just went with chocolate sauce or honey. Don't worry. It's yummier this way. But ketchup is... Wow. That's enough ketchup. Now would you like chocolate sauce? Uh, well, I guess so, yeah. You probably would prefer it. Yeah. Wow. Yes, put a lot on. Yeah. Mustard! Oh, excellent choice. Brown and yellow match perfectly. I think it's gonna add some mystery to the dish. Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce. Hey, what happened to the pancakes? There. Perfect. I think we should say grace and eat. Okay. Okay. So you pray with Daddy. Okay. Dear Lord. Dear Lord.

I think it's time to ingest this pancake and be a good... Hey, look, it's Soppida. Oh, she's gone. Oh! That's the best pancake I've ever had in my life! Can I see the bill? Oh, yeah. The bill? Four hundred thousand dollars? You must be out your mind, woman! You trying to... Come back you little...! That's a good one, too. Hold on, don't hog the picture. How you gonna hog the picture? It's not right unless Daddy's in the picture. That's magic. Come on, it's late. Okay. Daddy? I'm scared about the Fall Sing on Saturday. What are afraid of? Your mother told me you were excited about it. Well, everybody has a solo and mine is on the last song. I start it, so if I mess up, the whole entire song is wrecked. What makes you think you gonna mess up? I can't sing. What do you mean you can't sing? I can't. Yes, you can. Where's the song you're gonna sing? Let me see. I'll put it to the right page. What song? This page. All right. All You Need Is Love. That's a good one. The Beatles. Tell you what. Here's what you do. Come over here. I'm gonna get you onstage. I thought you'd play the part. No, you get onstage. I'm the audience. Just like you're at the play. The people in the audience have all come to the show. "Ooh, this is great. I can't wait to see the show. Who's in it? Who's that? I wonder if she can sing?" You gotta get ready to sing, 'cause everybody's watching. Now you gotta say: ♪ There's nothing you can do that can't be done ♪ I can't.

Olivia's mother gives her a kiss and says, 'You know, you really wear me out, but I love you anyway.' Olivia gives her a kiss back and says, 'I love you anyway, too.'" There you go, sleepyhead. Hey. Hm? We didn't talk to the princesses tonight. You know what? We didn't. But that's okay. It's quite all right. Maybe if you want, you can talk to them yourself. Really? On my own? Qwali says she trusts you now. That's very nice of Qwali. Tell Qwali thanks a lot. That means a lot to me. Or I could tell her myself. You want me to? Hey, you want me to? Did you fall asleep that quick? I send you out to gather pertinent information. You come back with this. But this is all he does. He hangs out with his daughter. They sing and dance and laugh. They're playing with a blanket. The two of them, their faces buried... In a blanket. The blanket. It's a wakalyapi. Oh, yeah. He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat! Wak... Say that again. Wakalyapi. A tapestry. A weave. It's how you access a higher eye. My people believe it's the way to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit. Who are you calling? You'll see. The entire Denver financial community is talking about you. But as your very first client ever, you owe it to me to tell me... What the hell is going on? I told you, Maggie, I'm just listening. To the little voice that whispers to you. Yeah. Right. Why don't you just tell her your secret? Hmm? Hi. Johnny Whitefeather. I'm Margaret Johnson. Evan? Tell her the truth. Okay, here's the truth. I have a six-year-old daughter. She has what you'd have to call a magic blanket. With this blanket, I'm transported to a mystical, magical place where I meet three invisible princesses and one queen, who incidentally have remarkable insight into investing, except for one, who mostly wants to throw rocks at me and have me burned up by her dragon. A securities blanket. Fine, fine. Keep your secret. Just keep me in the black. I can get a blanket. I can. And I'm gonna get one. I need to see you guys in my office, please. You may have noticed I've been doing things a little differently, letting the two of you go head-to-head more than usual. And I know you've probably heard the rumor. And it's true. There's an offer on the table. And it's big. It's the kind of out I've been looking for. But the buyer wants to make sure there's someone worthy to, well... Take this office. So... Ah. Here we go. Gentlemen, this is Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. Investments. You're Frederick Pratt. Yes, I am. Excuse me. Yes, Sir. That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo? Uh-huh. He's ready for you. Hello there. Mr. D'Enzo. An honor to meet you, Sir. Thank you. Have a seat, gentlemen. This won't take long. I assume that Tom has told you about... Mr. Danielson, everything okay? Yes, Sir. Just had to kill the phone. It's dead now. Okay. I assume Tom told you he's decided to throw away the rest of his life playing golf. Which means one of you is going to be running the western division of D.D.E. Now you won't be surprised to know that I've been reviewing your files. And, frankly, you're both applying quite unorthodox methods. I don't really care, as long as you get results, which you seem to be doing. But, unfortunately, gentlemen, there's only one chair behind the big desk. So I have a decision to make. I'll be stopping in Denver on my way back from Beijing tomorrow to make that decision. In the meantime, you have approximately 17 hours to suss out what Mr. Pratt is about to hand you. As far as preparation is concerned, I'll just share with you the best advice I ever heard. (Chinese) No, That's not the advice. The advice is: "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my axe." Abraham Lincoln. You read my book. Three times, Sir. It wasn't clear the first time? That's not what I meant. I think I know what you meant, Mr. Danielson. All right, gentlemen, it's 2am in Beijing. Do you know where your axe is? I'll see you tomorrow. May the best man win. (Chinese) These are a few strategies Mr. D'Enzo is considering. We will require your most detailed analysis and recommendations. I'll leave you with Mr. Pratt. Okay. Page one. Olivia! Hey! Olivia! Big night! Big, big night tonight! Where are you? I want to talk to the princesses and Qwali and all your friends! Got a lot of questions! Get to stay up late! Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you? Where is she? You picked her up from school, didn't you? Yes. Then Mrs. Trish came and took her away. What? When?! About one hour ago. Why would she do that without calling me? You know why? Because I took the battery out of my phone. Let's see here. Listen. Did Olivia leave that little blanket? The Goo-Gaa? Let me check, okay? Hello! Trish! Evan, where are you? Olivia called you five times. Then she got upset and called me. I had to leave the pledge drive. It's a long story. But listen, you'll never guess who I was just talking to. Not now, Evan. I'm at the party. What party? Ella's party, which you obviously forgot about. I forgot. Listen, tell Olivia I'll be there in 20 minutes to pick her up. Why? I'm already here. You did your week. I'll stay here and take her to Ella's for the sleepover. Sleepover? No, no, no, no. I don't know if a sleepover works for me tonight. I need Olivia here with me. Here with me and her blanket. Her what? I know this is gonna sound a little crazy, wild, but the fact of the matter is... I need, uh... I need the Goo-Gaa. I don't have a response for that, Evan. No, Trish, listen. I'm hanging up now. No, Trish, Trish, Trish! Bye! ♪ I'm here ♪ ♪ I'm here for the party ♪ Okay. If you're here for Ella's birthday party, make your way to the orange slide and into the Kidz Only Zone for some Fo-Fo-Figgley fun. Come on, Ella. Olivia! Trish, want me to... No. I'll deal with this. You get over there. Olivia! Evan, what is going on? What are you doing here? I know. Everything's fine, everything is cool. Where did she go just now? Uh, she went into the Kidz Only room. What is this, Evan? Nothing. Everything's cool. How we doing here? How're you? I'm good. Trish, do you mind helping Lori with the cake? Go help with the cake. I'll do what I was gonna do. Hey. It's my daughter's seventh birthday! Congratulations. You're gonna think this is hilarious, but I gotta go get Olivia's blanket for like six hours. You need her blanket. Yes, I need the blanket. I see. That's what you're here for, to cause a scene. I'm not causing a scene. You're making it a scene by stopping me. Just let me get the blanket, then there's no scene at all. Let me talk to you. What's the problem? We've seen what happens when you take Liv's blanket. Duly noted. Now is not the time nor place for it. Let me explain something to you. Let me say something. What I'm gonna do will take all of ten seconds. I'm gonna get the blanket and be gone. That's the end of the deal. Know what I'm saying, John? Just let me do my thing. Hey, hey, hey! What's the matter with you? John, you the... Hey, what's up with the football block? Come on. Hey, be cool. You be cool, okay? I am being cool. I just need the Goo-Gaa! When a grown man says "Goo-Gaa," it's time to go. Okay. All right. Okay. It's cool. All right. You made your point. Still got it. All right, that'd be cool. I'll tell her you said, "Happy birthday". Yeah. She'll be touched. Hey, John. Is everything okay? I took care of it. He's gone. What did you say? Don't worry. I put my foot down. That's the last we'll see of Evan today. Whoo-hoo! Ow! Ah! Hey. Hey, little brother. My man. Hey, little man. Do me a favor. Go into the Kidz Only room. Tell Olivia Danielson her dad's out here. I'll give you $20. Tell her her dad needs the Goo-Gaa. A what? It's a Goo-Gaa. It's a pet name for the blanket. I need the blanket. Tell Olivia her dad needs the blanket. $20, man, come on, brother. I'll take 50, my brother. Fifty? Or you take your grown self and get the Goo-Gaa on your own. Hold on. Hey, stop it! I'm not here to play with you! I haven't been to the cash machine. I only have $26. That's more than half of $50. And I got this. Ha! Peet's Coffee card. I got $15 worth of credit. Know how much coffee you can get for $15? Drink that coffee, you can keep playing and playing! I'm a kid. I don't drink coffee. They got cookies and cakes and scones. You like scones? Scones? What do I look like, the Queen of England? Ha! Stop that right now! I'm not here to play with you! I'm talking to this child. That's a nice Rollie. That is a nice Rollie and you're not getting my Rolex. Come on, man. This is $26 and a Peet's Coffee card. Easy money. You want it or not? Not. Get this fool! Ow! Ow! Grandfather, will you bless the blanket? (Indian) Here's the mon... (Foreign language) This guy? The blanket works best through the innocence of a child. Okay. Good. Thank you. Indigo! Wake up, buddy. Hey. Wake up. You're going on a vision quest. I don't wanna. I'm tired. Well, you're gonna. Your new tribal name: Red Bull. Okay, I got this. I can do this. I'm thinking it through and letting it flow. I do not need the Goo-Gaa. Let it flow, Evan. Let it flow. Okay. I know this company. Yes. I don't know this company. No. I don't need the Goo-Gaa, 'cause this is what I do. Whoa! Oh, look at that. All right, how you feeling? I'm still tired. Yeah? You still tired? Get up there. What is this? The relationship of this currency to this company five years out. Maybe if you want, you can talk to them yourself. This is a wakalyapi, okay? Star blanket. I need you to feel the magic. All right, first up. Oleon. Oleon Investments. How do you feel about them? I want to go to bed. You want to go to bed? Bull! Red Bull. More of it. And a lot more in the garage. All right, I got a Goo-Gaa, too! Here's my Goo-Gaa! You're the only one with a Goo-Gaa? Here's mine. And I can rub it in tiny circles, too. And I can spin in a circle. (Muttering) Oh, I'm where the princesses are! Soppida's dragon! Hit me, Daddy! HalliCom Investments. HalliCom Investments. Sell it! Sell? Sell it? Sell it! Write it down! Come on! Moppida and Koopida, how are you? I have some questions for you! One quick question. Pylong. Buy it! Diego Industries. Sell it! Talk to me, ladies. It's beautiful! Ah! I can't hear you. Are you whispering? One sky! If you're whispering, I can't hear. Talk to me louder. You have approximately 17 hours. I don't know if a sleepover works for me tonight. The fact of the matter is, uh, I need the Goo-Gaa. Go on, I dare ya! Is that all you've got? Is that all you've got? That's gonna leave a mark. Oh! Mr. Danielson? Hey, Ella, how are you? Why are you stealing our blankets? I'm not. I'm taking them to get cleaned because they're dirty. You go back to sleep. Night-night. Mr. Danielson? Hey, what's going on, Will. How you doing? Why are you in our house? It's all good. Go back to bed. I'm on my way out. Why do you have blankets? To get them cleaned. You're having a bad dream. This is my sister's blanket. Be a good little boy and go back to bed. No, give it. You're being very disrespectful. Give it! Give me the blanket. Give it! You're a horrible little boy! Give me the blanket! Shh! What? Evan, what the hell are you doing?! He's trying to steal their blankets. Oh, for God's sake, Evan! Have you any dignity at all? Yes, I do! No, you don't. Look at you. And now they're up. Hey. You are stealing our blankets. See? Now you messed with my little girl. Everybody calm down! Calm down! I just want this one here. This one... Here you go. Here's your blanket! I just want this one! Okay. It's all good. You're not taking no blanket. I paid for this! I don't care... Wait, wait! (Whispering) It's little Evan. Now you want to whisper? No! Come on! Get out! Wait a minute! It's okay, Baby. It's mine! I'm calling Trish! Nice, Evan. Really nice. Evan, get help. Get help! I don't need help! What I need is my blanket! Man, you crazy! I am not crazy! I want my Goo-Gaa! I want my Goo-Gaa! John! This is important! We'll call the police! I want my Goo-Gaa! I want my Goo-Gaa! John, come on, man, this is life and death! I want my Goo-Gaa! I want my Goo-Gaa! Come on! Yeah, man! Johnny! Come inside before the neighbors call the fire department again! Hey. Cheryl, we're down here working. You think your new nose just crawled on your face? What's the next one? John! Yeah. I'm sorry. Look, um... What's up, bro? Listen, it's getting late. I think we need to rethink this blanket strategy. Hm. You doubt the wakalyapi? No. Absolutely not. So you are saying my son's not a seer? Is that what you're saying? I see beyond, like the great salmon! With wings! That flies! Ha! You got tiny eyes, man. You got the eyes of a salamander. What? You say my kid's not a seer? He's a Whitefeather! Come here, boy! Get over here. AampCo! What are you feeling about AampCo? AampCo is tight! AampCo is tight! Write that down! Ha! Write that down! Johnny, I'm not gonna write it down. I can't go to Dante D'Enzo and say "AampCo is tight because we're listening to the Great Salmon who's actually a ten-year-old boy with a $6,000 blanket, who's hopped up on Red Bull!" Ah! What? Ah! What? Listen to me, Johnny. This is an opportunity of a lifetime. We can't blow this. You are better than this. Tell him he's out. You're out! What? Tell him he's out of the tribe. You're out of the tribe! I'm out of the tribe? You're out of the tribe, because you are blind to the poetry of smoke! Blind to the poetry of smoke! Zip it! You are a crazy little kid. And you're a liar! I'm out?! Good. Wrap it up! I have never been so happy to be out, okay? I didn't go to business school for this! I graduated from Stanford with an MBA! They don't just give those things away, Whitefeather. Get him. Back off, you little freak! Get some sleep! Hey, Trish, it's me! Trish, I really need to see her. No. I just now got her to sleep. With tonight, and singing tomorrow... Please. She just... Please, Trish. Okay. Thank you. Can you please leave? Hey. I'm sorry about what happened at the sleepover. I want you to go. About the concert... I'm not gonna be able to come to the concert. Because it's at the same time as a meeting. I don't want you there. Okay. I understand. I just want you to know that I really did want to go. I don't care. Don't come. I won't. I won't because you don't want me to. But... Liv, I really have to go to this meeting. It's a really important meeting, and I really need... I promise I'll get it right back to you. Night-night. It's okay. She's fine. She gave it to me. What? She told me, Evan. Everything. Okay, then you understand. No, I don't understand. Do you honestly believe that blanket has something to do with everything that's been going on? I don't know what's happening, but I know something's happening. I need for it to happen one more time tonight. So now we're back to what you need. Trish, what do you want me to do? Blow an opportunity I've waited for since grad school and lose my job? Evan, you have two jobs, and one of those jobs is being a father. And she needs to know you care as much about that job as the other. I do. Of course I do. Then leave the blanket. I can't. Not tonight, I can't. I don't expect you to understand. ♪He's a real nowhere man ♪ ♪ Sitting in his nowhere land ♪ ♪ Making all his nowhere plans ♪ ♪ For nobody ♪ ♪ Does not have a point of view ♪ ♪ Knows not where he's going to ♪ ♪ Isn't he a bit like you and me? ♪ ♪ Nowhere man, Please listen ♪ ♪ You don't know what you're missing ♪ ♪ Nowhere man ♪ ♪ The world is at your command ♪ ♪ He's a real nowhere man ♪ ♪ Sitting in his nowhere land ♪ ♪ Making all his nowhere plans ♪ ♪ For nobody ♪♪ How you doing, Feather Man? Pretty good, brother. How you doing? Not so bad. A little amped, a little tired. Ain't nothin' but a thing. How about another Red Bull? Wouldn't say no to that. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Good luck, Johnny. Luck is for losers. Ah, good. Here we are. Gentlemen, this is Mr. D'Enzo. Hello. Nice to meet you, Sir. Mr. D'Enzo, John Whitefeather. Have a seat, guys. D-Papa-D to the Feather Man. I think you're reading my signals, and I think you're reading them loud and clear. You're getting the wisdom. Diversification. Buy long, sell short. Sell short, buy long... Hi. Good morning and welcome to the Fall Sing. It's so good to see so many of you here today. Well, I can hear a lot of very excited children back there, who, like their parents, are not here to listen to me continue talking. So, without further ado, the wonderful Chilton School Choir. ♪ Summer fades into the blue ♪ ♪ Brand new colors come into view ♪ ♪ Seasons change I have, too ♪ ♪ Just like the leaves of autumn ♪ You know what I see in this room that nobody else sees? Hidden feathers. That's what we share: hidden feathers! Crow feathers. Right now... I need you to caw with me. One crow to another crow. Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Bring it. Caw! Come on. Caw! Bring it in. Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw! I know you want to let it out, but I appreciate you keeping it in. There it be, Brother Crow. Look forward to working with you, man. Wow. I've never seen anything like that before. I know. No, you don't know. Quite frankly, that is one of the biggest loads of crap I've ever heard. What possible excuse can you give us for wasting our time with that unctuous stream of drivel that you call a presentation? My kid. What? My kid. He wanted to get more involved in my workplace life. He's like, "Dad, I'm on a vision quest. I got some investment ideas." I'm like, "You're nine. How many good ideas could you have?" He's on a vision quest. I'm like, "Vision quest, my red butt." You're blaming your child? Look, don't let it rattle your corn stalk... All right, enough! I don't mind this Indian business when it's working. When it's not, it's just... Annoying. Whoa. That's deep shadow time. Seriously, cut the crap. You're not even a real Native American. You're mostly Finnish-Armenian. Your baptismal name is Johann Hasuvian. And your great-grandfather was one half Navajo. So, what would that make you? One thirty-second? Frankly, you are an offense to true Native Americans and if you have nothing better to offer... All right, all right. Johnny Whitefeather can see which way this wind's blowing. It's your loss! Old croaking toad. I'm going this way! Well, Mr. Danielson? Looks like this job is yours to lose. I'll get right to it. Mr. Danielson? Evan? I can't do this. I'm sorry? I messed up. I really have. Sorry, what? Are you walking out? I'm really sorry, Sir. I just can't. You realize what you're giving up? Yes, Sir, I do. I'm sorry, Tom. Could I see that brochure, please? Ain't nothin' but a thing, man. Next, we will sing a traditional Japanese folk song about the blooming of the cherry blossoms. The Sakura. (Japanese) Whoa! Sorry about that! The next song is one you all know, so feel free to sing along. Just don't sing louder than us.

It's called a crown. You were really great in there. Thanks. Listen, I got something for you. I don't need it anymore. Really? I was hoping you would take it and help me apologize to the princesses. You can do it yourself. I can? Yeah. They're right there. Oh, okay. Well... Ahem. Soppida, I wish that I could say you were wrong about me, but obviously you and your dragon knew better. I'm sorry. Thank you for protecting Olivia while I was away. And, uh, Koopida and Moppida, I'm sorry for taking you for granted and just expecting things from you and not realizing how smart and kind and... Truly amazing you really are. Qwali, thank you so much for letting me come into your mystical, magical world, because it was a truly... Daddy. They're leaving. They got bored. Oh, they got bored. Do you want me to ask them to stay? What do they want to do? They said it's time for them to go. Then I think they should go then. Wave goodbye. There they go. Hey, guys. What're you doing? Uh, just waving goodbye to Qwali and the princesses. Really? They're going away? How about that? You know, I think there's somebody here to see you. Mm-hm. So they're really gone, huh? Mm-hm. Nice outfit. I take it this is why you walked out of our meeting. Do you know how many people have ever done anything like that to me? Two. You wanna know where they are in their careers right now? Each one is running a key division of my company. I don't want any sycophants around me. I want people with confidence who are not afraid to make decisions, even under pressure. Incidentally, this is very good. You are very good indeed. And I want you to head our western division. I'd like to discuss that with you. So please. Sir, I would love to discuss it now, but... It's Saturday. Oh. Sure, yeah. Well, Monday then. Monday. Well, congratulations. Thank you very much. I have a daughter, too. I haven't seen her for years. So... Have a pleasant Saturday.
