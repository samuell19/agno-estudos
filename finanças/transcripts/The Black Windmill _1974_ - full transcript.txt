Come on, James. I bet my daddy builds the best planes in the whole wide world. This is great! Do you want to try my plane? I bet you can't do it. - You're on. - What are you doing here? - This is government property. - It's abandoned. - Not now. Didn't you see the signs? - No, we didn't. Come on, hop in. - What for? - You have to see the officer. - We've done nothing wrong. - You tell him. Don't give me no lip, lad, just get in there and hurry up. Right, corporal. Found these lads on the runway, sir. - What are your names? - Tarrant, sir. - Stroud, sir. - Where do you live? We're from Quinton House. - Take 'em to the school. - Sir. We've put this field under care and maintenance. - You're trespassing. - No one told us. - We didn't see any signs. - They're there. Tell the headmaster to warn all the boys to stay away from here in future. Sir! All right, you know the drill. A hundred apiece. Can we trust those two not to talk? - What's up? - It's stuck, I can't get it over! Pull, man! We can now. Miss Ceil Burrows? George Lampton. So? Oh, Sean Kelly told me to come here. Oh, one of those. Is Sean here? He doesn't live with me if that's what he told you. Oh, no, he told me that I could get in touch with him through you. Well, he's out of the country. - Do you know when he'll be back? - You can never tell with him. A week, maybe. What's the matter? Did he offer you a job too? Want some coffee? Yes, please. Black. Take your coat off, sit down. Just released this morning? Yeah. How well do you know Sean? We were in the same cell block together for about six months. What kind of a job did he promise you? He just said that my training would come in handy. What training? Well, I was in the army before I... went away. What regiment? Royal Engineers. Building bridges? That, among other things. Sorry to rush you, I have to get to the West End. What about Sean? Come back in a week, after six. Do you think he'll give me a job, then? He'll have to. Do you need money? No... I can last a few days. - See you next week. - Yeah. Goodbye. Thank you. You were wonderful. Really wonderful. You know it takes an actress to do that? A marvellous actress. You certainly take your bloody time. For Christ's sake, move yourself. - What's wrong? - The duty officer called. - What's the matter? Couldn't get it up? - It's foreplay that takes the time. When do I get a Mata Hari assignment? When you've lengthened your foreplay. Take it easy, will you?! Are you trying to wipe us out? Royal command from Cedric Harper. You've got to be at Sir Edward Julyan's for a meeting of the General Purposes Committee. - I'll get it, Margaret. - Thank you, madam. Come in, come in, whoever you are. I'm Major Tarrant. Greetings. And goodbye. Mind telling me where the Committee meeting is? - You're one of Edward's spooks? - Yes. I'd have thought it was child's play for you. The Conference Room, second door on the left. Do you know it's 1.30? Where the hell have you been? Working. You know everybody, I believe. General St John, Mr Heppenstal, Admiral Ballantyne. Sorry to drag you all this way out of town, can't shake this damn flu. We want to know if you've succeeded in penetrating the sabotage ring? I saw the woman Ceil Burrows this morning. - Who's she? - She's linked to a man in the ring. Whom I believe to be a Soviet agent. Sean Connery. What? Kelly. Sean Kelly. My God, Harper, you gave me a start. Commies going that far. And how did Sean Kelly's lady friend react? Cagey. She said he was out of the country and asked me to come back next week. To check up on you. How is Major Tarrant's cover? We gave him the name of one of our ghosts on the army list, Sir Edward, George Lampton, who was cashiered for passing dud cheques and served part of his time in prison while Kelly was there. - What happens when Kelly comes back? - He won't. Station D erased him. What do you make of all this, General? We at MI5 have identified the arms supplied to Northern Ireland as Russian, - shipped through Czechoslovakia. - Yes? Our people think the only way to cut off the flow is to hit the bastards back. Hard. I can assure you that will be done. Harper? - Our operation... - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? - The duty officer, sir. He's got Major Tarrant's wife tied in on another line. She says it's urgent. You might tell your wife we're not an answering service. But since they put her through... - Carry on, Harper. - Our operational instructions... - What's wrong, Alex? - John, a man just called. He said David's in trouble. - What happened to him? - If I knew, I wouldn't be ringing you. John? I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. The phone call was probably a hoax. - He's had an accident, I know he has. - I'll be with you as soon as I can. ...assorted high-explosive devices, or Soviet weaponry intended for Northern Ireland and intercepted by our agents. - Bye. - Bloody marvellous! - What's all this going to cost? - Precisely £517,057. - In what currency? - Uncut diamonds. The people we are dealing with demand payment in something they can hide easily and convert whenever they have the chance. Not bad news, I hope. Some trouble with my son, sir. I'm sorry about the phone call. You'd better get off home. If you don't need him... No, thank you, Sir Edward. I'll see you in the office. - Thank you, sir. - Now, where will we buy these diamonds? I purchased them three weeks ago at Rand and Goodbody. Would you drop this off for me? - Sure you don't want me to wait? - Positive, thanks all the same. Who else have you phoned? Only the school. What did they say? He and his friend, James Stroud, signed out for the day. They went somewhere to fly that model plane you built him. Don't, John. The man said he'd call back at three. It's almost that now. Can you rustle up some tea? What about the other boy's parents? The headmaster said they haven't heard anything yet. And there's been no police report of an accident. Well, at least that's good news. He asked if we'd both be at this number. Yeah, yeah. Of course I'll be here. This would never have happened if you hadn't given him that damn plane. I've got some leave due soon. When he gets back, we'll take him to Cornwall for a little while. - It'll be like the old days. - We could go to Harrogate. I'm talking about a holiday for David, not a command performance for your father. Tarrant here. My name is Drabble. We haven't had the pleasure of meeting, Major Tarrant, but I feel I know you very well indeed. - Are you the man who spoke to my wife? - That's right. For God's sake, what's happened to our son? Nothing. So far. - Where is he? - He's quite safe. But it will cost you something to get him back. If you know who I am, you will also know that I don't have any money. It's not money I'm after. What do you want? To talk to your director, Cedric Harper. I'm afraid I don't know anyone of that name. I'd advise you not to play the clown with me, Tarrant. Just have Mr Harper, your Director of Subversive Warfare, on this line at seven o'clock. How do I know that you've got David at all? I thought you might ask that. - David? - I'm all right, Daddy. Please do what the man says. Please, Daddy, so they'll let me come home. Drabble? You hear me? Drabble! Groin. Heart. Head, sir. Very good, sir. Shoulder, fire. Throat. Mr Harper? - Yes? - Did you get my message? Oh, yes, something about a kidnapping. - Yes, my son. - Head! Oh, dear, I'm terribly sorry. You suppose Tomkins got that thing rigged up for us yet? - Should have, sir. - Reload. ...the kidnapper's name is Drabble. And for some reason, he wants to speak to you. - Excuse me, sir. - Extraordinary. - Does he think we're related? - Ready to see a demonstration? - Drabble's calling back at seven. - It's nice and simple. - How do you arm these things? - After you slip this forward, the mechanism is cocked to fire. Then you release this trigger under the handle - and it fires. - All right, let's have a show. It's not bad, eh? - Any painful after-effects? - My ears are ringing a bit. It's better than getting shot up in the whatshisnames. What a toy! It makes no impact on the hijacking devices at the airports. The most harmless looking gadget you could imagine. Take it anywhere without missing a heartbeat. And look... Contents entirely unharmed. Very good indeed, Tomkins. Thank you, sir. Are you going to take the call tonight? Why should a kidnapper pick on you? Do you have private means? No. My wife's family has some money, nothing excessive. He asked for me by name? Yes, he wants the head of the Department of Subversive Warfare. He knew my name and he knew the name of this department? Both of these things imply serious breaches of security. I don't give a damn about security. Do you really think people don't know the name of your department or your title? Really. All I can think about right now is my son. Naturally. - Are you going to take the call? - Tell your secretary - where I can find your flat. - The call is at my wife's house. - Oh, yes, you're separated, aren't you? - I'll be there until this is over. Brief McCarthy to take over your work. Don't discuss personal problems. Make sure you see the Burrows woman next week. - Sollars? - Sir? - Get me Chief Superintendent Wray. - Very good, sir. 17th century oak chairs. 100 for these. 100 I'm bid. 110. 120. 130. 140. 150. 150 pounds. 150. Phillips. Lot 48, the French beech-wood clock by Antoine Olive. 50 pounds? 50 is bid. 55. 60. 65. 70... How lovely to see you, Major Tarrant. - What are you doing here? - You scared me out of my breeches. I'm duty officer, I don't hang around for choice. Why don't you use your own office? Because I cannot see the maids' quarters in the hotel from there. I've got some personal problems, Mike. You're taking over for a few days. Don't give me that crap about a few days. They've finally recognised the better man. Do I get a crack at Burrows? Yeah, that's right. Study this file on her, I want her under surveillance. But remember one thing. I'd rather you lose her than let her know she's being tailed. OK? Yeah. Is there anything I can do? I wish there were, Mike. All OK this end. Right, thanks. Telephone engineer's standing by, sir. I don't have to tell you to keep him talking as long as possible. Tracing the call with this direct dialling is not going to be easy. Is your wife going to be present? Yes. This machine, does it switch on automatically when the telephone goes? No, I switch it on manually. Please come in. You know Mr Harper. And this is Chief Superintendent Wray of New Scotland Yard. Very sorry about this, madam. We'll keep out of your way as much as possible, but we have to have a man here round the clock to monitor the calls. Wait. - 8894. - Drabble speaking. - Is Harper there? - Hold on. Yes? I am listening. - What do you want? - Just in case you think this is a hoax, a Land Rover on the motorway at the Lightwater Interchange was blown up by a bomb yesterday. That was our work. I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well. You keep fading in and out. It's a bad line. Would you mind repeating that? If you miss anything, you can always play it back. What makes you think this is being recorded? Because you'd be incompetent if it isn't. Two men were in the vehicle, killed with 50 pounds of plastic explosives moulded into the frame of their seats, detonated by a radio signal. Think about that while you wait for me to call again. Do you have anything on this explosion? The local boys thought it was the IRA. I'll look into it. - Did you get anything? - They didn't have time, sir. They think it originated somewhere in Brighton. - Harper here. - Drabble speaking. We want £517,057 in uncut diamonds. You won't have no trouble remembering that figure, will you? Just a minute. You're not the man I spoke to just now. There's more than one Drabble. Be at this number tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock. We'll tell you then where to deliver the diamonds. That's... That's a great deal of money to find in just a few hours. Don't play any games. You bought the diamonds from Rand and Goodbody three weeks ago. The boy will be dead in 24 hours. If you think we're bluffing, have a listen to this. David, come and speak to your mother. Don't worry, Mum, I think everything will be... I think I'm going to be sick. Shall I see if they've traced it? Take him where I can't hear him. Come on. Come on. Shh! Sh! Sh! - Is Sir Edward in? - They're at dinner, sir. Would you tell him I'm here? Mr Harper. Will you wait in the library, please, sir? Would you just follow me, please? Come. Excuse me, sir. The Leicester police have just found the lad, James Stroud. - Is he all right? - He's a bit off his head. But he's under doctor's care. What do you think of Tarrant? - Cleared for security several times. - So was Philby. Kidnapping his own son to extort money. - No, it's too much for me. - Me too. But you know Harper's convoluted thinking. If he hasn't solved the Times puzzle by 10am, he has to go to his doctor for a check-up. There's probably nothing in it, but see what you can dredge up. Phone Tarrant. Tell him I'll pick him up in 15 minutes. Mr Harker? Er... Harper. Sorry. I'm Melissa Julyan. My husband will be with you in a moment, if they ever let him leave the table. Thank you, Lady Julyan. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. That means you're on duty. Like a stage policeman. As a matter of fact, I don't drink. Don't tell me you prefer pot? No. Please don't keep Edward too long. We have the Home Secretary here and you know how he likes an informed audience. God, you're a handsome brute! Isn't he irresistible? The only way I can guarantee he saves it all for me is by totally exhausting him. We're embarrassing Mr Harper, darling. I've wanted to do that all evening. Besides, Mr Harper probably investigates all those blonde spies you send out to fornicate for England. It's not only gorgeous lechers like you that have what it takes. Don't keep him long. Or I shall come in here and drag him out by force. Never ceases to amaze me, what she sees in an old ruin like me. She's obviously very devoted to you, Sir Edward. That's one way of describing it. - Now what's all this about Drabble? - It's more serious than we thought. Let's talk in the garden, I've been shut in all day. From what this Drabble said, it's obvious they've penetrated my department very deeply. He made a point of emphasising that the ransom demand is the same amount as the uncut stones I've acquired for direct action. What's your conclusion? It has to be somebody who knows what's going on. That includes you. And me. And all the members of the General Purposes Committee. The kidnapper chose Major Tarrant's son. You chose Tarrant to penetrate the sabotage ring. I'm not denying... denying his ability, Edward. I think it's a waste of time, but place him under surveillance if you like. - I have. - Oh. What am I going to say to Drabble in the morning? Well, we won't pay up. The Minister would never sanction it. But don't tell Drabble that. Or Tarrant, either. David, where are you? David? David... David... James. Watch that bat... Bloody fool! Some super cherries at Lowdens... James... can you hear me? I am David Tarrant's father. Keep away! Keep away! You're a spy catcher, aren't you, sir? David's always talking about you. Can you describe to me the men who kidnapped you? ♪ Underneath the spreading chestnut tree - James? - I love you And you love... I'm afraid it's no use. ♪ ...the spreading chestnut... ...not me. - What did they drug him with? - Not me! Some type of hallucinogenic. Probably LSD. When will he be coherent? Perhaps in a couple of days. Even then, he may not remember anything about the kidnapping. - Take her away... - Come on, sir. As soon as the boy talks, they'll notify us. The Strouds live in Kilmarnock. They're as bewildered by this whole thing as you are. We didn't tell them about the ransom demand. Trying to keep it out of the papers. Did you see his face? Come on, I'll take you back. The flat at the back is Tarrant's. At 180 pounds. 180. Kerr. Lot 50, a George III mahogany tea caddy. 30 for this? 30. 35. 40 pounds. 45. 50 pounds. 55 pounds. 60. 65. At 65... Good morning. Major Tarrant is here, sir. - Yes, show him in. - The Director will see you now, Major. Sit down, Tarrant. Kindly have the goodness not to smoke in here. These dracaena are abnormally sensitive to air pollution. If you want to poison yourself, that's your affair. Kindly don't include me in your suicide plot. Or my dracaena. I... I thought it would be helpful if I brought you up to date. You realise of course that a leak of serious magnitude has taken place within this department. If... Drabble is privy to the information he's already given us, we must assume he has knowledge which could endanger the country's security, and put countless lives at risk. I appreciate that the security aspect is your main concern. Mine is the safety of my son. Yes, quite. I'm sure you know we're doing everything possible. The bill of sale from Rand and Goodbody for the stones. Are you going to give them to him? Have you any reason to think that we won't? It just seems a great deal of money for the life of one small boy. I hope you don't mind my saying this, but... I have been observing you since this affair began, and you seem to me to be remarkably composed. - For a man in your predicament. - Oh? Isn't that what I'm trained to do? Hide my feelings? I suppose so, yes. Well, that's all for the moment. I just wanted to keep you in the picture. Well, thank you very much, sir. Major Tarrant? I expect you saw General St John leaving? - Yes. - I don't mind saying how much I resent his MI5 snoopers poking about in our MI6 affairs. However, the General may wish to ask you a few questions. There are certain aspects of this business which he finds quite baffling. About your involvement, principally. - Involvement? - It's a noun. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "the condition of being implicated, entangled or engaged." You know exactly what my involvement is. Yes, I know. Well, I'll see you at 11 o'clock. I don't think Major Tarrant's gonna like this. Don't you have to have a warrant or something? Only on the television. Excuse me, dear. - I really don't think you... - If you're worried, why don't you call Downing Street? Tell them Alf Chestermann is here. That's Chestermann, two Ns. The Prime Minister will probably talk to you. What I can't figure out is why we... Scotland Yard's finest... always do all the dirty work for MI6. I mean who the hell are they? That's just the point. Nobody knows who they are. You've got to be pulling my leg. You mean there's nobody to check up on 'em? How are you going to check up on them when there's no "them". Can I ask you a personal question? Without committing treason? Be my guest. How do you get to be one of them? Do you know what the "I" in MI6 stands for? 'Course I do. Intelligence. Need I say more? You reading us, Harry? Oh, God. Here, look at this. Ooh! Hello, darling. "Dear John the Tireless." "Love Ceil." Why "the Tireless"? That was a nickname he picked up in the army. I wonder what he picked up in her? - You ready? - You reading us, Harry? Would you like some tea? That's very kind of you, sir. Thank you. It must be a boring job. I'm just very sorry about what's happened, sir. I think if it'd been my boy, I'd have gone out of my mind. - Registered package. Major Tarrant? - Yes. Just sign this. Ta. Did the telephone engineers hold out any hope for this morning's call? The trouble is they have to work back through various circuits to the point of origin. This takes time, sir. Excuse me. - Who was that? - A registered letter. I have to go to the office. I can slip back to the flat and collect some things before 11. That lousy damn job of yours. If you'd stayed in the army, none of this would've happened. - It has and we have to face it. - Don't be so damn controlled. Don't you feel anything? I'm sorry. I can't help it. Everything that's gone wrong between us is because of your work. We're not gonna help David by fighting. I'm not like you, John, I have to come out with it. Well, go ahead. What happens tonight? When the 24 hours are up? I mean if the government won't pay the ransom. Of course they'll pay. Don't humour me! I've got to know what's going to happen to David. Nobody can tell you that for sure. They're going to kill him, aren't they? - They are not going to kill him. - Aren't they? No! I married a soldier, I ended up with a spy. I just hate what this job's done to you. Have I changed that much? At least then I knew where you were. And who you were. I love David very much. And if I had thought for one moment that my job might cause him harm, I would've resigned immediately. He will be all right, won't he? If there are things about me that you hate, Alex, be grateful for them now. They could be our last chance of seeing David alive again. - What was that date again? - The 14th of May. 14th of... Ah, yes, here it is. The ring was bought by a Mr J Tarrant. For cash. Ever see her before? - Not in that position. - But you recognise her? Certainly. She brought the ring back a few days later for an adjustment. - It was too large. - Do you know her name? I can do ever better than that for you. That's a Miss Ceil Burrows. 1, Cleve Road, NW6. Do you mind if I have a look at that picture again? Thank you. - 60, please, sir. - Thank you. Drabble speaking. You're going to Paris this afternoon, Tarrant. Ignore the instructions I give Harper. Instead, go to Restaurant Vagenende, boulevard Saint-Germain. Alone. A contact will be waiting for you there. Hand over the diamonds and your boy will be delivered to you in good shape. Au revoir. - Harper here. - Drabble speaking. If you have any concern for the boy, don't interrupt. You will give Tarrant the diamonds at once. He will go to Paris this afternoon, alone. With the diamonds in his possession, he will stroll the Champs-Élysées unfollowed until our man contacts him. - Why does it have to be Tarrant? - You interrupted me, Harper. So... Please. D-Don't! Harper, if you want to end Mrs Tarrant's agony, do as I have said. I will not call again. Surely your wife, Tarrant, as the wife of a soldier, must realise that we can't bargain with the enemy merely because he holds a hostage. Even if that hostage does happen to be her son. I er... I really am... ...most dreadfully sorry. But I have a responsibility to 55 million other people and that responsibility prevents me from giving you the stones. I'm sure you've got plenty of other things to do. I know I have. Miss Monley, I'll take those papers for Sir Edward now. And you may have an extra hour for lunch. Oh, thank you, sir. Mr Ilkeston's office. Mr Harper speaking. Could I speak to Mr Ilkeston, please? One moment, please. Sir. Sir, Mr Harper's calling. Ilkeston here, Mr Harper. - What can I do for you? - Call me back on my private line. - Harper speaking. - Ilkeston here again. I'm sending one of my officers round to collect the contents of Box Number 552. His name is Major John Tarrant and his number is uh... ...87iZi56. He will properly identify himself and he will be carrying a key to Box 552 which has been given to him by me. I would be grateful if you would expedite matters as I'm in rather a rush. Thank you. Call me when you're ready, Major. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Mrs Tarrant is below in the garden, sir. Thank you. Alex. I'm going to Paris now. I just came by to assure you that David will be absolutely safe. - How? - Well... I stole the diamonds. I have to go. You hear me? I hear you. Miss Monley, sir. I thought you should know, sir, your desk drawer's been broken into. - What? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Oh, here's Mr Sollars. Mr Harper's on the phone. - I've alerted the department, sir. - The key, man. The key for the stones! My God. It's gone. Phone the bank. If that bloody Ilkeston has given Tarrant the stones increase surveillance to maximum level. But don't alarm Tarrant. Let him lead us to Drabble. I'll be in the office immediately. Excuse me, Sir Edward. If Tarrant is guilty, all we need is a positive link between Tarrant and Drabble. That's only a matter of time. Wait a minute! Mind the doors! Get out. Yes, sir, it's the same Ceil Burrows that you assigned Tarrant to infiltrate. That's right. And a jolly good job he did of it. And you knew nothing of this relationship? - I find that incredible. - Well, sir... I'm not surprised he got away from those bloody fools in MI5. Judging by the hour, he eluded your efforts too. - We'll catch him, sir. - Oh, will you?! - Do you know where he's gone? - No, sir. No, of course you don't. But I do. Well, Miss Burrows, Paris has certainly done things for you. Well, Paris does things for everybody, Major Tarrant. Even Englishmen. I take it you have the diamonds. Yes, they're in here. But the only way you'll get them is to give me my son in perfect health. If I leave now, you'll never see your son again. Yes. But then, you'll never see the diamonds. Taxi. Quai de Bercy. Funny, that's where I'm going. Merci. Ladies first. Tell him not until I've seen my son. Drabble? There was really no reason to deliver the diamonds personally, Major Tarrant. I want my son. - Then you have the diamonds? - In the briefcase. David's not here. He's in England. - Where? - On a pleasant farm. His room looks out on to two rather unusual windmills. You don't look as if you're armed, Major. He's not. Give me the diamonds and I give you my word your son will be returned to you. You'll get them when you give me my son. It won't take us two seconds to break that stupid chain if I'm forced to kill you, Major. Should my grip relax on this trigger, it'll detonate enough explosive to rip your guts out. All right. You two stay here. I'll take you to him. He's downstairs. What an astonishing man you are. No questions, no indignant protests. It isn't cricket, huh? You're the kind of machine who should be working for us. Who's "us"? Don't you know? At least you know Ceil Burrows works for me. After you. David, your daddy's here. David? Don't disappear, dear. I've plans for you and the diamonds. Thank you for your co-operation. We'll take Major Tarrant back to England where I can formally arrest him. - - Merci. I want this man dressed and on his feet immediately. Where is David? Why am I here? I'm afraid we have to take Major Tarrant with us. - - Drabble... I think I can best expl... The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts lost a promising pupil when you joined the army. What are you talking about? The fact that you were found in Miss Burrows' hotel room. - The late Miss Burrows. - The late Miss Burrows? I would've thought from the Polaroid picture you took of her on your bed that she was the perfect companion for a man of your type. Yet you strangled her with the chain on the briefcase. A lovers' quarrel? What the... I can't get up... Get going, you fool! Merde! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the captain speaking. We are now on the approach to Ramsgate and we hope you've enjoyed the crossing Would you please remain seated until the craft has come to a complete standstill. Thank you. Will all passengers recently arrived from Calais kindly proceed to Customs and Immigration Control. Passport, please. Thank you. - Anything to declare? - No, nothing. - Hello? - Is Maria there? - Who? - Maria. This is Mr Trapp... ...calling. I'm sorry, there's no Maria here. Are you sure you have the right number? I wanted Dominion 8894. Dominion? Oh, I understand, Mr Trapp. I think you have the wrong exchange. This is Bayswater 8894. Oh, I am sorry. You have been most understanding. - I have to do some shopping. - Very good, madam. I think I can save us both some trouble. Would you mind terribly giving me a lift? Then you'll know just where I am. - Where would you like to go? - 29 Eldon Road, W8. As you've been so nice, I'll be here for some time. Why don't you slip off and have a meal, or something? - Hetty. - Come in, my dear, good to see you. Seems ages. Forgive me, Hetty, but I have to leave right now. What is this? Where on earth are you going? Out the back way. I hope you don't mind. But I mean... Are you sure you won't stay to tea? Alex. - How's David? - As far as I know, safe. Come on. ♪ The hills are alive with the sound of music... How did you ever remember that? How could I ever forget it? Or the Dominion Theatre? Remember? David dragged us to see that film, what, four times? - Four and a half. - All fares, please. - Two fives. - Two fives. But if this woman belonged to Drabble, why did they want to kill her? To incriminate me. Harper's convinced that I murdered her. All right. But they had the diamonds, they had you in a French jail, charged with murder. Why should they want to fake that escape and try to kill you? It makes no sense. I don't know. Unless the man behind Drabble is a member of the General Purposes Committee. It still doesn't explain why they wanted you dead. Yes, it does. Don't you see? He would know that whoever interrogated me would find out I'm speaking the truth. He would have me killed trying to escape. I'd be guilty and nobody would look for another defector. Our only hope of finding David is to make the real Drabble break cover. - But how can we do that? - Wait a minute. What did Drabble say in Paris? He said... wherever David was, out of a farmhouse window, he could see two unusual windmills. Now, that policeman at your place said the Drabble call originated somewhere in the Brighton area. - That's right. - Two unusual windmills on the South Downs. They must be buildings of historical interest. They might even be protected by the... - National Trust. - Yes. - I could track them down for you. - It's our last shot, Alex. If we mess it up, or if I'm arrested, you know we may never see David alive again. Off you go. Take care, darling. I'll be at the Red Lion pub in Duke of York Street. Phone me there. The Red Lion. Is there a Mr Trapp there? Thank you. - Hello? - Darling, I think we've got it. It's called Clayton Windmills, Hassocks, Sussex. You take the A23 to Brighton. Good luck. Yes? My name is Drabble. Is Mr Harper there? Just a moment, please. Cedric, it's for you. I think his name is Scrabble. - Harper here. - Drabble speaking. Tarrant is back in England. We must move fast. Just a minute. You're not the man I spoke to earlier. I told you before, there's more than one Drabble. So stop stalling and meet me at the two windmills. With Tarrant free, we are all in deep trouble. My name is Drabble. Is Sir Edward there? Is my son alive? You bloody madman, you've broken my arm! - Where's my son? - What the hell are you talking about? - I got a call from Drabble. - You got a call from me, Julyan. From me. Now, where's my son? In the black windmill. Now, you bastard, get up... ...and take me to him. If you so much as raise your voice, I'll smash your skull in. Your son's in no danger, he never was. I just had to have the money. I was in line for Chief of the Service. They were going to axe me for a younger man. What was there to look forward to? My pension wouldn't even pay my wife's hairdresser. I didn't want to involve you, Tarrant. It wasn't my idea to torture your son, for God's sake. But I had no choice. Don't you see... All I can see is a deranged old fool. And to think I once admired you. How many in there? - Two. - Who are they? McKee and one of his gunmen. Ring the bell. I'll split my share with you. You'll have your son back. McKee's selling the diamonds for me. My share is 400,000 in Swiss francs. Ring the bell. David? Daddy. David. I'll take you back to your mother now. We both love her very much, don't we? ♪ ...And there ain't no ifs or buts ♪ She said "I love you" ♪ And the blacksmith shouted "Chestnuts"! ♪ Underneath the spreading chestnut tree ♪ There she said she'd marry me ♪ Now you ought to see our family ♪ 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree... ♪ Chestnuts! ♪ -- English --
