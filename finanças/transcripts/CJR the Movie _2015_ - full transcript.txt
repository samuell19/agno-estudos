Whatever happens, the four of us will always be a family. But with every meeting, there will always be a goodbye. With heavy hearts, starting today, Coboy Junior will be just us three. EVERY GREAT JOURNEY HAS TO END IN A GREAT WAY - Hey, when did you get here? - Yesterday. You have to try the steak here. It's delicious! Okay? What matters is that it's fun! - Play there. - Okay. Let's go. - How are you? - How are you? - Hey. - Hey. Over here. So, let's just play singles. You play first. I'm not playing. Then the two of us will play. Never mind, Di. I'm not in the mood. What's wrong? Are you sick? Isn't it weird? Now it's just the three of us. Like something's missing. Whether it's three or four people, it's no difference to me. - It's because of me. - Why are you saying that? You did nothing wrong. You're so emotional. - Why are you so emotional? - Right. Maybe this is God's way. We'll just keep going. What are you eating? - JOIN ME. CASSEY'S HERE. - WAIT. Hey. I'm going to meet Salsha first. Just like usual. She misses me. Okay? Be careful, Di. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Just the three of you? JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL because we'll have a pop quiz. Okay? Hey. Bastian already left, didn't he? Who's going to leave next? - Kiky? - Aldi! I think he'll be the one to leave. What's certain is that they'll break up. He's mad. Bal, wait. They were just joking. They're Comates too. Maybe that's just how their disappointment shows. All right? Don't take it to heart. That's the thing, Dib. I'm afraid if other Comates think the same way, - then CJR will break up. - Surely that won't happen. If you guys can prove that you're still solid, still great, I'm sure that kind of talk will disappear. If only people knew that we're like a family that shouldn't be separated. Oh, yeah, Dib. - Thank you so much. - Thank you for what? Because you've supported me all this time. Us! I meant CJR! CJR! Adiba. Sorry. Hurry to the library. The bell will ring soon. Oh, yeah. Let's go. - Surprised? - What are you doing? Look. They're having a meeting. Don't be noisy. What are they talking about? I don't know either. But I think I can guess. What? "Pat, I think it's time for us to make Jimmy a big artist." "We can't do that, Roy." "Joshua is the one suited to being a solo artist." "But I think Jimmy has talent." "We should have him join the members of CJR." "We can't do that. CJR is three people now." "How about the two of them become a duo?" - "What should they be called?" - "Joji!" Joshua and Jimmy. Joji! Joji doesn't sound fun. Duo Jijay? Let's call it Duo Jijay! Milk and coffee! We'll do it, right? We'll make you a duo. Milk and coffee duo! Okay? - Peace be upon you! - Peace be upon you too. - Mr. Roy! - Patrick. Pat and I have good news for you all. So, we're preparing something amazing for you. We want to make you guys fresher. That way, Comates will look at you as something new and amazing. So I plan to take you to Australia. - So lucky! - Yes, but listen to me first. It's not a vacation. From Melbourne, a road trip to Sydney. And then, vocal lessons with my friend. - So it's not a vacation? - It's okay, it's still Australia! All right. So, listen. While you're there, I'll stay and look after things. I have to finish a few things in Jakarta. So I can't come with you. Mr. Roy, does that mean only Pat is coming with us? - No. Not just Pat. - You mean you're taking me? I'm close to the kids. I'm already used to taking care of them. - So it's best that I... - Hey. Can you speak English? Hey, am I not good at English? Just so you know, I speak Australian. - Yeah. - Australians speak English. - Really? - So that you won't fight, you should just do rock-paper-scissors. The winner can go. Okay? - Come on! - What's with you? - Childish. - You gave up? - You gave up! - No. - Two... - You gave up. ...Three! You guys are so slow. The plane will already be full. - If it's full, you'll have to stand. - What are you saying? - It's not a bus. - Patience. - Sorry. - No need to rush. Relax. Plenty of time before takeoff. Am I right? - Yes, plenty of time. - I see. Okay. Then I'll talk to my kid first. All right? Di, later, be careful when you're on the plane, okay? If you want to eat or pee, don't go alone. Ask for the driver's helper. Driver's helper? Why would there be one? Whatever they're called. Okay? Will you be fine on your own, Mom? I'll be fine. There's Lena and Faisal. Relax. Where are Jimmy and Joshua? They have the passports. Now, that's a problem. There! What's with you? What did you bring? Relax. When I get there, I'll buy you a souvenir. You'd better. Uncle! Aunty! Boss! Are you ready? Aren't you wearing the wrong clothes, Jimmy? He also brought a lot of stuff. You're such a hick. This is a holiday, man! We're going to Australia! When we get there, let's sunbathe! - The plane to Melbourne... - That's your plane. - Come on, let's go. - The luggage. - The passports. - Passports. - Be careful there. - Come on. We're here! After hours of sitting next to Jimmy! Oh, my God. He snored so loudly! - Where is he? - What? He was with you. Yes, he was behind me. - Jim! - Oh, no. Name? Jimmy, sir. Jimmy. - One. One time. Jimmy. - Look, I've explained it. My name is just Jimmy. - Since... - You're in Australia now! Thank you, sir. - I'll look for Jimmy. - There he is! Jim! He can still smile. - Where were you? - What were you doing, Jimmy? There was an immigration check. That's what they said. Don't worry, kids. - Let's go! - We'll watch over you! Don't disappear again! - Do you know which way to go? - Go straight. - Watch out. Slow down. - So many cars! We already set up transportation for you guys. - Is the car good? - Here it is! - Where? - This! - This? - It's good and small. - We'll fit. - It might be small but it's fast. - Like from Indonesia. - You're right. We'll use it to go to "Melbron". - What? - "Melbron." This one? - So cool! - I told you it was this one! - You said it was that one! - You saw me point! - Where are we going, Jimmy? - It's so cool. - I'll give directions. - What button is that? - I'll take care of it. - Sir. Your luggage is inside. - Sorry, Pat. I was... - Do you have a license? - No, I don't. - Get out. They're so cool. Have you ever asked, "Why do I keep singing?" Have you ever had that question? - Not yet. - Not yet. I have. So... The point is, I realized that doing music isn't about what we receive any more. It's more about what we give. Sorry, so... From now on we have to establish within ourselves that when you guys sing, it's not just for you. Not "I get money," or "I get something." It's what you can give to the audience. Happiness. Making them laugh makes you really happy. Doing good deeds. Basically, right now we eat first. Our stomachs are empty. There's food but it hasn't been shared. If I sang, what do you think I'd sing for? To ruin the mood. "To ruin the mood"! - A city like this is so artistic. - It's great here. If this were in my village, people would be fishing. Is Sydney the same? Sydney is more like Jakarta. Melbourne is more like Bandung. It's calmer and a good place to find inspiration. I missed coming here. I need to calm my mind. - Didn't you study in Australia? - Yes. Here. In Melbourne. I didn't finish my studies. Really? Why? The tuition was expensive. I had to work. But it wasn't enough to cover the tuition. My studies were a mess. You need to remember that education is number one. Don't leave it. You have to keep going. Jim. Stop taking selfies. Go to school! - Go to school! - Stop taking selfies. - Go to school! - It's okay here. Let's take one selfie. - Come! - Take a selfie. We can do it here. - Who's that for, Di? - For Adiba. - You're amazing. - Not really. It's for Salsha. Guys, don't you think it's weird? What is? Why did Patrick take us here just to practice vocals? He said he wanted to calm himself too. If he wanted to relax, he could go to Puncak or Bandung. Or Bogor. That's it. - You have a point. - Right? It might be to do with CJR. That's enough. You don't need to think about that. You need to trust Pat. I'm sure he's thinking of a big concept for us. - Right? - That could be it. He knows what's best for us. We have to believe that. I hope Patrick can make us cooler. I'm sure he can. Awesome. Let me see that, Di. Emmanuel Kelly is a great singer and a great man. Yeah, sure. I was found in a box in a park in Iraq. Can we take a picture? Kiky. What are you listening to? You look serious. Must be a good song. Can we listen? Isn't this the song that Emmanuel Kelly sang? It's perfect for how I'm feeling right now. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing. But they keep singing a sad song. After meeting Emmanuel, you should be more inspired. No need to be melancholic. Is it wrong to feel doubt? Listen. You've been through a long process. Making music, singing, performing, being entertainers. It's a long process. Right now you need to learn to do even better. - Right, Jim? - That's right. - You need to have faith. - That's it! That's rare of you! - Finally. - That's right! - Amazing. - I have faith too. One day, I'll become a big artist. Who would want to watch you? What's your stage name? - Jimmy McKenzie! - Okay, Jimmy McKenzie! - That's cool! - Jimmy McKenzie! - Jim. - Yeah? - Do you like it here? - In Melbourne? - Yeah. - I like it. But it's hard to find rice here and it's so cold. - You'll get used to it. - It's only for a while. I like it too. It's a beautiful city. It's neat. And romantic. Like in the movies. Right? You know what romance is? Don't tell me that you're in love. I'm not! Seriously, I'm not! Stop that! I'm not! Enough. I know when someone's in love. No need to hide it. What are you doing, Sha? Just playing on my laptop. Why aren't you sleeping yet? I can't, I'm thinking of you. - You're being dramatic. - You don't miss me? - No. - Why don't you miss me? I mean you're not wrong. I got mixed up. I, Jimmy, am a god of love. God of amor. Cupid. Cupid? You're stupid, Jimmy! I'm being serious! - Am I right? - How did you know? - I know. - How? What kind of souvenir? My heart? You don't have to ask for that. It's special just for you. What's wrong with you? You keep using sweet words. If you have hidden feelings, it's better to express them. Talk about your feelings. Be honest. Say it. Reveal it. We're close, but she's just my classmate. Yeah, your classmate. But it's not wrong to have feelings. Oh, my gosh! What does a 14-year-old know about dating? You have a point. Stop flirting! It's already late. Hey, I gotta go. I'll call you again later. Okay. But you hang up. - No, you first. - You first. - You first. - You first. - You said you wanted to... - Here. I'll hang up for you. - Kiky, why did you hang up? - You're the one dating. - But you used up my data. - Just a little longer. There's nothing wrong with having feelings. Just let it be. Time will tell. Time is telling us to sleep! That's enough. Hey! It's about romance! Come here! - Tell me about your troubles first! - Jim! Go to sleep! Okay, Pat! Help me, dear God. Let me meet the most beautiful woman in this country. Let me meet her soon. And make sure she's my soulmate. I can't wait any longer, God. Let me meet my soulmate soon. Amen. - Good morning, Pat! - Hi. Did you sleep well? - Have some breakfast. - Okay. - Morning, Pat. - Morning. - Cereal sounds good. - Good afternoon. Good morning. - I'm so sleepy. - Go have some breakfast. We'll go right after this. To Sydney. A road trip. When? After you've had breakfast, packed and washed. You have to take a bath. It'll be a long day. What song is that? Show me. - Is this the new song? - Yeah. It's in English! - Where is it? - Here it is. Okay. - Is that everything, Ki? - Yes. Where's Jimmy? - Where are we going, Pat? - Sydney! It's still early. It's only two hours. - "Two hours"? - You said so yesterday. Melbourne to Sydney is like Jakarta to Bandung. Two hours is enough. The atmosphere! Not the distance! Look at that. Sheep always live in a flock. How come? Because they're defenseless. They're aware of that. So they have to look out for each other. If sheep can do it, why can't you? Pat is the best at this. - Sheep can grow wool for jackets. - Yes, so? To make jackets for us, how many sheep would it take? Try asking the sheep. Call them. - Come here! - How can we ask them? We don't know sheep language! Hey. Come, drink this. - It's cold. - Thanks, Jim. Pat. Why aren't we staying at a hotel? It's fine here. Hotels aren't good. It's better to be one with nature. I agree. You've been together for four years, right? What did you guys get from CJR? Ki. The eldest goes first. Then it should be me. - You're too old, Jim. - Too old. I'm thankful. I'm very thankful. I was able to help my family. My mom doesn't have to work anymore. - Also my sister's scholarship in Germany. - You're amazing. I couldn't have done it without CJR. - Aldi? - Me too, Pat. I'm really proud. Thanks to you guys, I renovated my house. Don't say you only renovated your house. Renovate the roads too. The way to his house is so narrow, to get in we have to walk like crabs. That's better than your house, which is all made out of banana trees. - Just keep laughing. - Bal. How about you? I'm thankful to have a family like you. You're the most important part of my life. Awesome. I know that I'll regret this. But I have to ask. What about you, Jim? - You regret it. - Don't laugh yet. I'll answer seriously. So since I've been with you guys, I've been very happy and thankful, because I have more friends. At first, I only had four friends. Now I have six. - There's two more! - That's pretty good! - What about you, Pat? - Well... I'm happy just seeing you guys like this. I'm proud of you guys. You're amazing kids. Why are we being melancholic? - Hey, the guitar. - Here. Give me some your treasures! What's with you, Jim? Me again. Hurry! Thank you, God, for letting me meet my soulmate. - Have fun practicing. - You're not coming? No, just go by yourselves. - Have fun. - Aren't we going? - Who's looking after them? - Okay. And where are we going? Sorry, sir. We had a bit of a problem. You guys need to learn again from the basics. Be patient. - Come on. Let's head back. - Stay strong! Don't look sad. Stay strong! This is crazy. We got such a fierce coach! What's fierce about him? He looked cool to me. He's not fierce. Just strict. Strict. That's it. That's right. It's the same thing. I'm scared to meet him. That's also right. - Jimmy! - "This is right," "That is right." You're inconsistent. Are you talking about D Doc? I chose him on purpose. So that you can improve and be better. Rest. Don't forget to pray. Here are their vitamins. Okay, Pat. - Jim, Kiky. Let's pray. - Come on. God is the greatest. I am witness that there is no God but Allah. - Eat a lot for breakfast. - Relax, Pat. If the breakfast is good, we'll finish it all even if there's a lot. I'm not talking to you, Jim. Even if no one tells you to, you already eat a lot. That's right. Pat, aren't our voices good yet? He said we only have our faces. Is that so? Who said that? - Jim! - Who? - How could he? - Don't get emotional. Who said that? D Doc? Don't see it as a burden. See it as motivation. The reason I brought you here was to improve. So, we're still not good yet? For your age, you're professional enough. But we want to be better. That's right. When I was your age, all I did was fly kites. The most I did was looking for sea urchins in the sea. Why the sad face? Cheer up! - We're pumped up! - That's it. - Hey, where are you going? - I'm going with them. No, just stay here with me. What? I feel bad for her. What if she faints? Who'll help? - The kids? - She's a trainer. Come on. But she's still a woman. - She has to... - Who pays you? - Jimmy McKenzie has to be strong! - Jimmy McKenzie! You don't want to eat? Do you want to eat? - Later. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Pat. Peace be upon you too. What is it? What's wrong? Are you tired? Had enough? We're annoyed. We feel like we've had enough. Why is he smiling? It's probably because of Mellisa. It's called falling in love. Hey, you don't need to talk about it. I'm replying to your Comate friends' mentions. - As if. - You're so fake. I wonder how the Comates are. How is it in Jakarta? Yeah. - Let's do a Skype chat. - Okay. Come on. What did I do? You'll take over my chat! Don't take over my chat! - I want to be in the chat! - Quiet. - Be quiet. - I want to be in the chat! - Roy? - Pat. - Hey. - Hey. - Hello. - You're always travelling now. - How's Australia? - It's fun here. It's awesome. How's Jakarta? There's Joshua, so it's all good. The tacky guy. How's he? - Tacky! - Hey. Careful with that "tacky" talk! Maybe I'm the tacky one. But if you knew this one thing, you'd be even more jealous of me. - All right, Jim. - Keep going. Here. This is my new girlfriend. Her name is Mellisa. Was she kidnapped? Did he threaten her? Don't believe me? Look carefully at the photo! - That's Photoshop. - Photoshop! Look. How could an edit make our cheeks touch? - Look. - Selfie! You can't read. Was that sheep your girlfriend too? - Yeah, right. - What are you talking about? Okay. We're preparing CJR's premiere concert that will be even more spectacular than before. - Awesome! - So, boys, you have to practice seriously. And follow the schedule that Pat prepared for you there. - Stay strong, boys! - Yes, sir! - Don't be tacky, Jim. - Hey, Josh. You'll see. - Josh. - The call already ended. Let's do some travelling! - Okay, man! - Like D Doc! - We're here! - Hey! Jim! - Want to go kayaking? - Let's go! I've never been in a kayak. - I've seen it in movies. - I haven't been in one either. It's no harm if I give it a try. - Right, Jim? - Hey, if we're going to race, don't think you'll win. I've used kayaks like this since I was young! You're so arrogant! Uncle! You're here too! From Indonesia to Australia! You're amazing! - Why are you here? - What? - Uncle, just use Indonesian. - Nothing, brother. - Just use Indonesian! - No! - We're both Indonesian! - Sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Why won't he use Indonesian? - He's not from Papua. - He's not from Papua? As long as they're not too stressed. - I heard D Doc is really hard on them. - I balanced it out with some travelling. - They also eat a lot. - Don't let them get too tired. Take care of them. I will. I can only hope and pray for the best for all of us. Don't hesitate. I'm your backup. If you're confident, the kids will be confident. Just relax. Just trust me. - I'll tell you if something happens. - Okay. All right. Pat, is something wrong? Why do you look so sad? I can't predict the future, Jim. I feel responsible for the kids. Like a big brother. I want them to do well in the future. Well, if that's the case, we're on the same page. We want them to do well. I also see them as my brothers. So that's why even though I can't do much, at least I do my best to make them happy. And I'm thankful to you for that. Don't worry about it. For me, that's part of the job. Maybe that's my gift from God. A cheerful and funny personality that can bring joy to the surrounding environment, so that people feel like they're living in nirvana. - Okay. - A paradise of happiness... Whatever you say, Jim. Pat! This is serious! - Keep talking to the sea. - Pat! This is a serious conversation! Pat! - Thank God. - Great. Wait. Right, Jim? Whatever you say. Did you understand, Jimmy? Hey, let's go there! Come on. Patrick, what are we doing? Why are there so many planes? - Skydiving. - Skydiving? - My stomach hurts. - Di. - What's wrong? - Stomach ache! Stomach ache? Scared, huh? Don't be scared. I'm used to diving. Every day there, we're always diving. - I'm a beach boy! - Mr. Know-It-All! Skydiving isn't diving in the ocean. - Up there from the sky! - You jump from up there. - From a plane? - Yes. - Me too. - Right? - Hey. Enough excuses. Come back. - Stomach ache. I ate something bad. Australian food doesn't suit me. - I'm not doing it. - No. - Everyone is scared. - I'm really scared. We have to learn to conquer our fears. Don't overthink it. Just do it! - Let's go. - I'm scared! - Me too. - Iqbal is brave. - I meant I'm also scared! - The kid goes first. Let's be scared together. - But is it safe? - It's safe! I think it'll be more fun if we play Galaxy. Yes! Listen. Just look at it. The layout is like this. - The color isn't out. - My thoughts exactly. It should be like this. Look. The color for this is out. That one is good. But that's the old one. - An old photo. - An old photo. Something's worrying me. - They're exhausted. - Right. From their trip. That's it. That's our homework. Stay cheerful! Remember to stay cheerful! If we have good intentions, all will be well. I'm sure God sees all our efforts. I'm glad I have a solid team like you guys. It's only a keychain. Do you mean "solid" like them? I'm giving you a T-shirt of a popular singer from Australia. - Great, Jim. - I don't know if it'll fit. - Try wearing it. I guessed your size. - Is this it? This is all brought me from Australia? - It's cool, right? - Bob Marley is Jamaican! Hey! I know he's Jamaican! But he's huge right now in Australia! You can get these in Blok M Plaza! - I bought this... Pat. - Yes. In Australia. - He's right. - Where? - A market! - Yeah. It's like a market there. Here. From Australia! It still smells of kangaroos! Try it. Does it fit? Son? He's asleep. Son. Son, wake up. Wake up. Son, your friend is here. - Who? - Adiba. - Hello. - Have a seat, Adiba. - Yes, Aunty. - Come on. What's wrong? Are you sick? - I'm exhausted. - It's all right. Just rest. All right. I'll leave you two alone. - Okay, Aunty. - Have a chat. Okay, I'll go. I'm not bothering you, right? Of course not. Relax. Oh, yeah. Here are the class notes from when you were away. - Thanks. You went to so much trouble. - No, it's okay. You! You keep surprising me. So, where's my souvenir? Wait a second. This is for you. - You don't like it? - I already have one. But that's limited edition! Sorry, Di. I didn't mean to be ungrateful. I'm happy to get your souvenir. Souvenirs aren't that important. More important is that you're home, you're safe, and you still remember me. - So, where else did you go? - First when we... Yeah! - Thank you, Jonas! - I'll be going. - Me too. - Yeah. Take care. - I'm going, Di. - Evan, thanks! Yeah. - Thank you. Dini, take care. - Bye. Again. Ki, where's Aldi? - The usual. - He's probably calling his girlfriend. - Yes, of course. - I was the same. You were like that too, sir? - Yeah. Are you doing fine? - Thank God, I am. Lend me the guitar. Play it, sir! - I actually can't play it. - Weren't you in a group? - But I played the drums. - Yeah. - You like The Beatles? - A lot. Kiky. That song was written by Paul McCartney for John Lennon's son, Jules, who was then named Julian. Jules was in an tricky situation, and this song was created. Why are you crying, Kiky? I'm talking about Paul McCartney and Jules! No. I just miss my dad. Kiky. Your dad's passing has to bring you motivation in life. I'm sure your parents are proud to see how amazing you are now. I already look at you as Aldi's big brother. So if you need anything, just ask. Think of me as your own dad. I'll always be there for you. Unless something comes up. Come here, give me hug. Hey. But don't tell Aldi or he'll be furious. Be happy. Thank you for loving me, sir. - Let's sing again. - Come on. - Any more questions? - Yes! Be patient. Go on, Miss. Is this your first trio concert? Will there be problems? No difficulties, because we prepared as best we could. We changed some of the singing and choreography, because there are three of us now. But we dealt with that. It's all taken care of. I'm sorry, that's it for now. So if there's... Later... - Thank you, everyone! - Yes! I'm going to drink this. - Three people. - I'm ready! Before tonight's concert, we should pray first. Hopefully it'll go smoothly and be a success. - Amen! - Not lacking in anything. - Amen. - Let's start praying. And we're done. Let's bring it in! - Oh, my God! - Iqbal! Call his mother! Someone fainted! Hurry! Gently. - Go with them. - The kids? I'll look after them. Jim. Josh, call his family. Technician! Don't leave. I need to talk to you later. - Hey. - Yes? Okay. We have a bit of a problem. Iqbal is sick. He can't perform. So I need you to make new choreography for the two of them. Make it simple. But still make it a great performance. - Okay. - Go with him. Guys, listen. I need a TV... Pat. Is he okay? He's okay. Just exhausted. Relax. Just let it be. - You're not a superhero, right? - What do you mean "superhero"? What I mean is that you're just a normal human being. You make mistakes too. Everything we do, we can handle it all. Sometimes we accidentally overlook things. What can we do? We're only human. What should I do, Jim? No need to do anything. Just be yourself. Like usual. You're always cheerful and strong. If something like this happens, just let it be. Just let it go. Let it go. Like that animated film. So for the choreography, we won't change it. Just blocking. - Okay? - Just for them. - Just for them. - All right. - Let's do it. - Thanks. Okay, boys. Later, for the lyrics, it'll be like this. A technician will put a monitor in front of the stage. So you'll know who sings each part. Okay? - It's supposed to be us three. - Yeah. Hey. Listen. Aside from Iqbal's health, my other concern is the Comates. They're excited for you guys. You have to perform well. You have to, okay? Okay? - Peace be upon you. - Upon you too. Hi. I want to take a photo with Iqbal. Later. Look at Iqbal's condition now. Later. That's fine. I'll just wait here so I can be close to Iqbal. - You'll make it stuffy. Later. - Jim... Bal. Get Patrick. Hurry. Are you okay? How are you feeling? - Just do it later, bro. - Hello, Iqbal. I'm Fico. I'm a Comate. See? Can I have your autograph? Sure. I'd like your autograph. It's okay. Here are the Comates from my neighborhood. Here... This is the president. I'm the treasurer. Can you sign... Sign here... Here. Please sign here. Iqbal's autograph! - What neighborhood are you from? - Ciputat. - Regards to your friends. - Yeah. - Pat. Is there any water? - Yes. Just lay down, Bal. Sorry. My physical condition is fine, Pat. But lately, I've been afraid. Afraid of what, Bal? I have a lot in my mind, Pat. We were fine with the four of us. But why only three of us now? - What did I do wrong? - You did nothing wrong. I did. Maybe I was too strict. - I pushed you all too much. - It's not that. I'm happy with what you do for us. Aldi and Kiky feel the same way, Pat. We wouldn't be in this position if it wasn't for you. I just think to myself, Pat. Why can't I be like Kiky? He's wise whenever there's a problem. Or be like Aldi. He can always be relaxed about every problem, but still be professional.
