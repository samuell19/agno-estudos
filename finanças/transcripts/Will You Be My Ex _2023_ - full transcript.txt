What's taking so long? Let me go first! We're family friends, right? They haven't come out yet? They're taking forever. For real? A quickie in the bathroom? Can you hurry it up? Come, girl! Come out! Aww jeez. You don't care, do you? Joey?! Chris?! You're back together? - How are you? Congratulations! - You too! Excuse me! Move! Move! Congrats, love! Congratulations, my cum laude. Where should we celebrate? Sorry, I just got excited. Obviously, because this is such an exciting event. Sandra, I don't think smoking is allowed here. So, hija, tell me. Where are you gonna celebrate later? Chris! Chris! Congratulations, honey! I finished it! It's your turn next! Now, honey, you've graduated. Are you ready to be... jobless? I know, right. Anyway... Hang on, are they my future in-laws? Ah! Oh my goodness! You know what, don't worry. I already talked to Chris. And I told her, of course, to prioritize work and her art. Am I right? As for you two, safe sex! You know what I mean! Sorry. It's true, right? I'm just being prac... It's true, yes? It's okay, love. I'm so proud of you. Hijo, congratulations. Adulting. Here we go. Thank you of course to Mom and Dad for this gift. Finally, I've got my own place. Okay. This is it. Wow! This is so nice. I wish I had one for myself. My sweetheart. I want you to be the queen of this place. Queen of your heart. Love. Why? Because. Because... why? What's this? Because it's cute! It suits your personality! Serious but with a cute side. Mm... For me, Chris, everything in life has to have a purpose. From the things you put in your house to the people you keep in your life. Because if there's no purpose, what's the point? Beauty... is the point. And besides, it reminds me of something. What? You don't remember? This. Your umbrella. Right? It's cute! Okay. Fine. My baby smells so good. Damn! Wait.. Did you brush your teeth already? No? Was my breath ever stinky? Jeez. I was just kidding. It's too early to be grumpy. I'm a Leo, remember? What time is it anyway? 6:30 a.m? Huh? It's already 6:30? I'm gonna be late! You can still make it! Go! Go! Go! How's my hair? Deodorant! Okay! Okay! Here... Oh my god! There we go. Quickly! Sorry! Sorry! - Cute! - Sure? Yes! - Shoot! - Okay! Go! Go! How do I smell? Good! Socks! Don't forget. I'll put them on the way. On the way. Sorry, sorry! Uhm... What is it? Glasses. Oh, right. Okay. Wait, oh my god. Your hair. Okay. How am I? I love you. Goodbye. - Bye. - Okay. I'm late. Bye! Late. Bye! - Watch. - Yes! Go! Oh my god. Love, I might come home late. They need me on the show tonight. I thought you'll be backstage? Sorry, there were changes. But I'll try to come home early, okay? I love you! Okay guys before we eat, let's give it up for this gal who saved our show! Go, Chris! Thank you! Bravo! Bravo! Thank you, Direk. Thank you for the opportunity! For our lady of the evening. Flowers? Speech! - What am I gonna say? - Speech! - Speech! - Speech! To Sarah, I'm thankful you're unavailable. If you were here, I wouldn't have had this chance to play the lead. Congratulations on making it to Canada and... I'll make you proud. Thank you, Direk. Thank you so much! Go on, have your dinner! Thank you so much. Love? Love, I'm sorry. I thought I could leave after the chorus but the lead had an emergency. And as the understudy, I've memorized all the lines so I stepped up. Sorry. Did you cook this? Come, let's eat. You could have at least called. I got really busy. I'm so sorry. Let's eat. The food's been waiting. It's so good! Did you make this? Wow! Wow! - Try some! - I'm going to bed. - I'm going to bed. - Wait. Aren't you gonna join me? It won't take long. Eat with me. Christina. I need to be up early for my fieldwork, remember? Just enjoy the food. All right, fine. I'll put these away. No! Don't. I cooked it for you. No, I'm good. I'll put these... Oh, love! I'll do it. No. Let me. - Let me do it. - It's okay, love. I'll do it. - I'll take care of it. - You should rest. You should get some rest. Leave it to me. Please. Go on. I thought we agreed. No shoes in the bedroom. And why is the light in the bathroom still on? Chris. I'm just trying to tell you something. You shoudn't agree to last minute arrangements because look what happens. You end up getting short-changed. You'll get stressed and tired and in the end, you'll be the one complaining. Love, I said I was sorry. But you know how important it is for me to be the lead in a big production. It's my dream. And this might be my only chance. Hey. Don't get me wrong. I'm happy you got lead. I am. But it's our anniversary, you know? I know. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry, too. Friends? We're good? Mm-hm. Sure? Mm-hm. Kiss me first. Sorry. Sorry. I want a sweeter one. - Huh? - No! Germany? You're leaving? For how long? Why didn't you tell me? I bet you are gonna make us all proud in Germany. Boss was asking you a question. He was talking to you. Yes, of course. I will confirm as soon as I can. Make it fast. This opportunity comes once in a blue moon. Not everyone is afforded this kind of a chance. Yes, sir. I understand. Thank you, sir. Sir, excuse me. I have to show you something. Excuse me. What? And here I was, about to tell you I'm jealous. You, jealous? Since when? I thought you were gonna tease me. I mean, Yanz! How will I explain this to Chris? If she really loves you, I'm sure she will understand. Doesn't she know how important this is? She will. She has to. Mm-hm. Just remember what a big opportunity this is for you. And one more thing. What? What is it? Because you're so tense at the meeting, your coffee was spilling all over you. I was literally shaking. You didn't finish your soda water. Thank you. Relax. I need to use the bathroom. I gotta check this. Wipes? You need wipes for that? Wipes. Thank you. Bigger diaphragm! Inhale! Exhale! Now, exhale. Give me five. And exhale! Our premiere night will be... in Dumaguete! Cheers! Dumaguete, here we come! Eight counts, from there... You okay? One, two, three! Jump! Ha! Keep wiggling! Shake it off. Shake it off, guys! Cheers! And flex. Point! And flex. Hands up! In three counts, reach the floor. One, two, three, reach it! Find your core, everybody. Find your core. Stretch. What's going on? Girl, please. Don't give me the bull. Are you pregnant? What? We shall look upon the glorious dawn! We shall look upon the glorious dawn! We shall look upon the glorious dawn! There's a big future ahead of me, Jonj. It shouldn't be this way. It's not part of the plan. Does Joey know about this yet? Oh, he knows that's why he's not going to Germany? Noel mentioned it to me. I thought he wasn't going because he found out you're pregnant. Joey doesn't know yet. Besides, he shouldn't make decisions like that. Hang on. It might work even more in your favor since you're pregnant, right? Wait! We're not even sure yet. That's why we're doing this, remember? We shall look upon the glorious dawn! We shall look upon the glorious dawn! We shall look upon the glorious dawn! So what if you're pregnant. So you'll stop for a year and you won't perform at the Dumaguete leg. Fine, I'll fill in for you! I know all the lines anyway! I'll be the lead! Yeah, right. On a serious note, Chris, I think Joey's gonna be a good father. Oh, shit! Here it is. Where? Let me see! Let me see! Let me see it. Love, eat up. Something you want to say? Oh, shit! I forgot I have a 9:00 a.m. I'll go ahead, okay? I'm sorry. Just eat. Bye. That's right, stay on your phone! We'll finish all this on time if you just stay on your phone! Don't you see that humungous hole over there? I told you, it's going to sink! How many times do I have to tell you? And you! What did I say? Project! Yes, Direk. Yeah, scratch your heads! You all look sick! Look at Chris. Follow her! Guys, I think something's wrong. What's happening? Are you okay? We need help! What's wrong Chris? Sorry for your loss. Chris?! Wake up. Have some coffee. Are you okay? I'm okay. Thank you. Love. How are you? All good. Chris. Love! Love? Love? Are you saying it's all my fault? One thing's for sure: I didn't do anything wrong! Jon! Jon! Jon! Brilliant! Brilliant! You show off! You monster! Amazing. That was a good one, Chris. Not at all. Alrighty. Take five! Let's take five. Direk... Wait. Great work, Cristina. How was it? I think he likes you. Jed's a hottie, I know you know it. He likes you. Oh, please. I'm married to me! Boring! Don't you get sick of it? No fingerprints? - Let me see. Let me see. Where? - Here it is. Here it is. Eww! Hi, sir Joey! Good morning. Did you manage to close the account with the Austrians? Yes, sir! Very good. Good morning, sir. Good morning. My meeting with the Go's, all set? Done and done. Very good! Anything else? One more thing. Welcome back! And welcome to your matches, too. Matches. Yeah. Should I set a dinner date? I... I don't think so. I mean, they're all the same. Boring! Just try. You never know, your next match might end up being your soulmate. Let's see... We're a match? Did I hear it right? You matched with your secretary on the dating app? Yana, I have to do something about these walls because the whole floor seem to know everything that goes on in my office. I'm surprised you didn't swipe right on her. You're not supposed to mix business with pleasure. But you know, it's weird that... We... We never... We didn't match. I'm not the type of person who uses a dating app. Hmm? Welcome back. Thank you. You'll definitely love this play. You think so? Two college sweethearts who meet each other periodically every year. I think. Something like that! It's supposed to be modern and minimalist. And apparently, it's gotten great reviews! - Oh, thank you! - This way please. Wow! Nice! They say, that when you ever get the chance to dance in the rain, don't let it pass you by. Once, I let the rain pass. I was afraid to walk into it. I only saw a perilous storm that would devour me. I've forgotten how beautiful, the way it makes all things bloom and open up to it. The flowers, my heart. If I could turn back time, I would dance in the rain with you. I'll let you take my hand. And cherish the moment in every droplet. With it, the downpour of our love. Our hearts dancing in an eternal rain. Thank you. You're really famous now. You've got fans now! Please give it to her. Thank you. Phenomenal. Who knew you were so good at this? It was okay. But did you see what I saw? An apparition. They're still there! Look! But here I am. Standing in the shade. Holding this love tightly inside my arms. Pleading the clouds for the softest of rain. A sliver of chance, to let it all pour out again. Congrats, Chris. - Well? - Thanks. Bridge, wait. They're still there! Look! I really don't think it's a good idea. Just one photo, I promise. Bridge! It'll be quick! You guys were really incredible. I could watch it over and over and not get tired. It was beautiful. Let's go guys! Look at our photos. She's so pretty. It's unreal. Look at her. Hey. You wanna have dinner? Hi. I'm still writing, I'm sorry. Come on. Do you wanna be left here alone? That's exactly what I'm going for. Anyway, I'll go straight home in a bit. I'll drive you. Jed, it's okay. I'm good. Okay. All right. Okay. Morning! Like clockwork? Like clockwork. Don't bother saving that. Throw it out. There he goes again. Online shopping. What on earth are you talking about, Vivian? Gorgeous, hot, sexy... Add to cart! Ugly, boring... delete. Wow. Coming from you? Like you're not a hustler yourself. But sir, us girls, all we're looking for is true love. What about you? What's your goal? Nothing. To have fun. I guess the rumours are true, then. They say since you broke up with your ex and you left for Germany, you turned into an "F" boy. From soft boy to fuck boy. Excuse me. Where are you even coming up with this basis of yours? In case you forgot, I'm the one setting up your dates every night. Oh, right. What happened to the last one I set you up with? Which one? Okay, yeah, we went out a few times. But she wasn't feeling it, I think. But if ma'am Yana's your destiny, I think I can get on board. I knew it. Vivian. Remind me to fire you. Bro, it's Jonjie's birthday. Let's drink! Joey?! Chris?! You're back together?! I'm sorry. No. Don't say sorry. It's okay. Did you miss me? I don't know why I did that. And I'm not even drunk yet. It's... It's very you. It's very Chris. What do you mean by that? Impulsive. Emotional. So you. Yeah, well, three years ago, it would have been cute. But now, it's just a little bit immature. I think everyone's immature. You just get better at hiding it. Yeah. That's it? Just because your dad told you to break up with me? I already told you this before. How many drinks have you had? I'm stressed. You know how I am with my beer when I'm stressed. What we have, we have for the mean time. We can't drag this out. What do you think I am, asshole? A computer shop? Pay per hour? You had the right idea. Break up with me. Go on! Oi! Carlo. Carlo! Hey! This isn't over! Where are you going? Hey! Hey! We're not done talking, Carlo! Hey! Carlo! Fuck you! Fuck you! You fucking asshole! Fuck! Shit! Carlo! I was only joking. Fantastic timing. Who are you? Come up. You poor thing. Thank you. What is up with men, huh? The second they get what they want, they simply discard you like... like trash. Men are trash. Do you agree? I don't think that's true for all men. You've probably never been hurt before. Why so you have a Pikachu umbrella? Is it emasculating to own one? I don't think so. Everything is a matter of perspective. Oh? So you're a life coach? I'm not a life coach, but I'm pretty sure you're gonna move on. Before you act like a damn expert and give out advice, who the hell are you? I don't even know your name. Ah, right. Joey. Christina. Chris. You still remember that? Of course. Don't tell me you don't remember? Want me to remind you? Yeah, how? I could act it out. Sure, yes. Carlo? Carlo, wait! Please! Wait for me! This isn't over! We're not done yet! Come back! You know, You fucking asshole! You know, there's a reason I'm the actor between us. Why, of course! That's why I'm a big fan of yours! Idol! I like it. Like what? My acting? No, you've loosened up! Thanks for ...for whatever this is. Reunion? Wow, reunion? Fine. For the kiss, okay? Thanks for the kiss. Thank you also. But I have a 6:00 a.m. tomorrow in Baguio. Rehearsals. Super early. You're an early bird now? 6:00 a.m.? That used to be your bedtime! Yep. Well, we grow older, but not necessarily wiser. That's life. Mm. Yeah. I have a 6:00 a.m. Okay, nevermind. - Bro, you all right? - We're great bro. Girl! Happy birthday, girl! Chris, one for the road. You mean a photo? - Of you two. - Us two? Come on, let's have a look. Say "Jonjie!" Jonjie! Guys, sorry. I have to go. My carpool's here. Jonj, happy birthday. Bye. Should I walk you? I unblocked you. Friends? Friends. Bye. Take care. Sleep early. Hi there! Ah, hi! Nice to see you! Say cheese! No photos please. Alright, bro! Let's drink! Sure? Yes. Aren't you driving? I can't believe you still have that. You're still using it. Irreplaceable like me? Hahaha Chris! Did you get to that audition? What's it to you? Hmmmm... A little hot-headed, are we? Lighten up a bit. Huh? I'll pick you up later. Why? What's up? Yes! I've got it. Okay, uh, sir Don? You're up. Sorry. You just got in? Yes, sir. Here's your number. Please wait for your cue. Go ahead, sir. See you! Next one. Christina Roxas. All right. Okay. Miss Chris it's your turn. Good afternoon! Good afternoon. If anyone here has any objections before the wedding, this is your chance. I object! Stop this wedding! Stop this wedding at once! Stop this wedding! In fairness. Not bad. I'm impressed. Thank you very much. However... Chris wait. We're really looking for someone... ...relatable. No pressure. Kiss me. But don't you dare fall in love with me. So there. From a noon time show, upscale ...and very popular. We're actually looking for someone who's a bit more... ...reachable! Can I borrow this? Didn't you put that in your mouth? Give me a sec. Hello! How's it going you guys? Hang in there! Keep going! Why did it turn into a comedy? Keep it serious. You have a pretty face! Unbelievably so, but you're still giving mestiza. All right, I'll give you Morena. National artist! There's no... Chance! Not a chance! So can you shut it? Enough! Okay? Thank you for your time. Thank you, sir. Next! Erwin, bring in the next one. She's making my blood rise. Jesus. What? My Pikachu's gotten bigger. Your steamed siomai. Thank you very much. The sauce. - Thanks. - You still remember? Of course. It's your favorite. Okay. Let's see. - What does it say? - It says... "The best things in life are free, but you can't have it all." Isn't that weird? The best things in life are free but the one thing you desire most will never be yours. You could say that "best thing" was never meant for you. Or that you've had it once but you let it slip away. Or you thought it was the best thing, turns out he's an asshole. You've been attracting assholes? I don't know, but I've met a few. Different exes. Yes. Like Mark. My co-actor. I thought we would get along because we had the same passions. But he suffered from insecurity. What about you? Me? Mm-hm. Marga. Marga? She was perfect. She wasn't fussy or dramatic, not clingy. She knew how to cook, she's smart. Wow. There's just a small problem. No big deal. What? Three-timer. With my friends, too. Three? Three. Not, two... But three?! Yeah. Wow. - That's life. - Amazing! Isn't that what you wanted? Just go on dates, ...no commitment. I thought so, too. But eventually, I realized that I want a meaningful relationship. Whereas she just wanted to mess around. She runs away from her responsibilities. Man, all we talked about were our exes all day. I think we should stop. Move on. Sounds like a collection of bloopers, huh? But at the time, we were pretty banged up. We were pretty silly. Do you think it's true what they say about exes who stay friends... That it's either they still love each other ...or they never really loved each other in the first place. I think... You first. What do you think? I believe... I believe there's still love somewhere there. Because after a relationship ends, where does it all go? All the love that you poured into one person? It's not like a faucet you can turn off when you're done. Even though it's been so long? Even though it's still painful. Do you want to talk about something? No. Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. Come on, Joey. Let's talk. Isn't that what you want? I said no. Fuck this. Yes, fuck this! Fuck this! You want to get mad at me, right? You want to swear at me? Go ahead. Let it out. Blame it on me! Why? Why? Why? Because I can't! Because I'm not ready! Because I'm scared! I'm scared! You got scared? That's it? What about me? I had a right to know! That was my baby, too! You know I wanted to have a family, right? You told me you wanted a complete family because you came from a broken one. We were on the way there, Chris! Why? Don't I have the right to think about what I want for my fucking life first? We're back to what you want. You're so fucking selfish. - It's always you! - I didn't want this. I didn't want to lose the baby! It's always you. It's always about you. Always... Selfish. Always? Always about me? Weren't you leaving for Germany? You made plans without telling me. So what is this? Who's selfish now? So you didn't tell me for what? You were getting back at me? This isn't going anywhere. There we go! This is what you do. Dismissive! You don't want to have the hard conversations! We shouldn't have lived together. We get this false idea that we're ready to have a family. This is not even fucking official. Yeah. Yeah, this isn't official. Fuck. We're not on stage, Chris. This is real life. Where is this going? I'm not sure what's going on I'm looking for answers Oops. Joey! Sorry. - Easy. - Thank you. Let me get that. Hold on to me. Lean over. - Thank you, Chris. - Hold on to me. Hang on. Come on, lie down. Okay. - Chris, thank you. - Okay. Sorry. Chris! Is it stinky? Joey. Thank you. I'm going home. Huh? I'll go ahead. No. It's all good. No, wait. Wait! I need to go. Hang on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Your arms wrapped around me Even if none of this is real anymore I can understand if you're fed up, if you want something else Don't worry I'm fine to wrap your arms around me Even if none of this is real anymore I understand, I know you're fed up, go where you're happy Don't worry about me I'm ready to forget you I'm fine I'll be fine I'll stay right here I'll be fine Chris? Chris?! Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! What's wrong? Chris! Where are you going? Home. Why? Just like that? What about last night? Chris! Last night? Fuck! Last night? Yes! Just sex. Fuck. Tell me what's going on, Chris! Chris! Hey, Chris, where are you? Please. Talk to me. Let's meet. Where are you? Let's talk. Chris Roxas. Answer me please. Let's talk. Let's meet at the cafe. Please talk to me. I'm begging you. Please pick up the phone. Am I an idiot? Yes. Really? You know it for a fact? I just answered your question. Am I a mistress? Mm... Well, yes. And no. No? And yes? No, because he didn't tell you. Yes because he is committed to Y and you are his ex. Fuck. I'm such a shit. Hell, yeah. That's why we're friends. Oh, shit! Wrong! Wrong move! I knew it was a bad idea from the start. That was it! What? The sex? Yes! Then I unblocked him and we became friends again. Because it's... It's supposed to be a closed book. I should have left it that way. Then this wouldn't have happened. Maybe there's a reason why you guys reconnected. So we can get back together? Whoa, whoa, whoa. The dude's got a girlfriend now. Or do you want me to push you just because you're my best friend? Don't be like that? Why are you sulking? Is he yours? He's not yours. You're gonna get jealous? Get depressed? You'll lock yourself up in your room, you won't eat? Your mom's gonna ask for you and you won't answer? Then we'll panic, and you'll unalive yourself? Then we'll bury you? Bury me? Can't you say a eulogy first? We're out of budget. Wake's one day, that's it. Someone's at the door. Chris is in here! Chris, I know you're there. Chris. Chris. What's the matter? Get out there. Let's talk, please. Go, talk to him! Chris, please. I know you're there. But seriously, have you ever thought about... What is this all about? Meaning? Maybe you like how comfortable you are around him. Or you're freeling guilty. Or maybe you have unfinished business with each other. Unfinished business? Mm-hm. Like a ghost? You're not making any sense. You know what I mean. You do. Right? Let's drink. Take a shot... Our shot. Let's drink some more. One for the booking! Chris, please. Let's talk. Ha-ha-ha-Ha! Ha! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy bithday, honey! Blow your candle! Make a wish! Thank you, Ma. - Thank you! - Of course! My goodness. Don't you have school later? How can I not worry? You haven't been on social media for days. And we all know that without proof of life online, you might as well be dead! Yeah. Ah! Sis, can I do a livestream? I've got followers requesting me to introduce my family. Really now? Your sister looks like a wet rag and you want to film? What? You totally don't! Never! Hey, guys! Welcome to my mini vlog. And for today, we're here at my sister's condo. Yeah! To do an intervention! Because she hasn't left her room in two weeks! - Hey! Why do you have to tell them that? - Isn't that awful? Sulking in her room for two weeks! And it's her birthday, too! Oh! By the way, I got her this Juicy Lushy bath and foot scrub so when she gets in the shower later... If she gets in the shower, she'll be squeaky clean! Influencer? Hey, guys. The script. - This is yours. - I'll help you. Here. Your girl's going through something. But she said she's coming today. Let's talk later. Facebook official. Go be happy then. Hi! Guys, let's welcome Chris back to the show! Welcome back, Chris! Hello! Give her a script. Oh, thanks. As I was saying... Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you! Thank you. Thank you, Direk. Make a wish. A wish? Thank you. Thank you. Wow! Thank you so much. Happy birthday! Thank you, Jed. - You're in a good mood. - I guess. Wait, hang on. Can you zip it? Easy on the chatter. We still have read-through later. Save your energy! Babe. Save your energy babe! Rich coming from someone who flirts on their phone all day. What, no way. I'm the true queen. Noel and I are going strong for four years. For four years, he's been pumping me full of love. Hey... I've got a photo exhibit this Friday. You two come, please. Please. Yes! Help yourself. Okay. Go on, be like that. You don't want to? It's not that I don't want to. Chris, support me for once. Support your local artist, best friend. Classic emotional blackmail. Hold up, I'm not blackmailing anyone. I thought you were fine? I thought you've moved on? You're even wearing boho today. Is it all for show, then? I just haven't figured out how to explain to him everything that's happened. How? Why do you need to explain? You don't need to justify why after having a very good sex, you just vanished. Maybe you just need to be there for him and show him that you're not into him. Show him that you have moved on. We were laughing because the whole conversation... It was so... Wait, wait. Sorry. But girls, you have to meet Alex. Yeah. Speaking. Alex! Jonj! Oh, thank you. Thank you. Damn, Alex. Your photos are so fantastic. So moving. Wait, let's take a selfie before you get famous. Love it. Finally. I believe in your talent. I wore a parachute for you today. For your exhibit. And I made sure I invited all my friends. Yes! Who did you say were coming? Big people. - Alex. - Oh, hey. Congratulations, brother. I'm proud of you. It's nice to see you. - Hello. - Hi. Jonjie. Hello. You two know each other? Yeah. We go a long way back. Yeah? He's the one who invited me here tonight. - Hi. - Hello! Babe, let me just get us drinks. - Yes, please. Get one for me, too. - Yes, yes. - Jonjie! - Yes? We have a problem? What?! How you feeling? Here's the thing... I'm having second thoughts. I don't know if this is the right time? Maybe it's too early. Maybe I should wait for a better time? This isn't my night. It's your night, not mine. Is it for them? It's for you. Besides, everything's in place. You can't back out now. - It's now or never, bro. - Jonj. Oh! Here comes the woman who'll get our show sold out. Alex, this is Chris. - Hi. - Oh, thank you. Chris, this is Alex. That's my best friend right there. Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi, Chris. - Hi! How are you? All good. Babe. Thank you. Chris! - Hi! - How are you? Nice to see you! Long time, huh? - We haven't seen each other in ages! - I know! - You look great! - Oh, you too. Super! Cute! Hi, guys. I'm Jed. By the way, guys. Jed, uh... Joey. - Yana. Hello. - Yana. Nice meeting you, bro. Pleasure's all mine. I'll go get a refill. Yes! It's over there, Chris. The bar. Okay. Thanks. Excuse me. Jed, I have to show you this masterpiece by Alex. Let's look around? This is nice. This one's from Madrid. Babe, wait I'll be right back. I'll just go there. Oh, go. Enjoy. I'll just be here. Chris. Chris! Christina. Hey. I'm talking to you. Christina, talk to me. Joey. Why are you avoiding me? Me? Of course not. Can you be real for a second, please? Sure, how can I help? Oh my... Please! Can you be real for a second. Chris! What? What happened? To what? Goddmanit, can we stop going round in circles? Why did you disappear on me? You just stopped talking to me. Why are you hiding from me? Why, is there a reason for me to stay? What's there to talk about? That you're with Yana while we were having sex? We were going on dates? What am I, your side chick? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Then you announced on social media that you're official. What's this for? What are we even talking about? And don't you dare tell me that we're just being friends. That's bullshit. It meant something. At least to me. It meant something for me! It meant everything to me! I missed you, Chris. I love you! No! I hate you. I hated waiting for you because I still love you. And I still love you, too. We can still do this. - We can fix this. - Stop it, Joey. We tried. It didn't work. It didn't. We can try. Babe? Are you okay? Yeah, babe. Just checking if she's drunk. She's fine. I'm good. Are you okay, Chris? Yes! I'm okay. Thanks. Yeah. Go. Sorry, babe. Not too long ago, you were just a pipsqueak. But look at you now. You are a genius and I'm so proud of you! Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Romulo! Yes! Thank you very much. But before anything else, I'd love it if you purchased some photos so Jonj and I have something to take home, yes? Right, of course. Well, actually, this night is special for another reason. Because long before I made it this far, he's been a patron of my work from the start. Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, my dude, my buddy, my brodi, Joey Martinez. He has a special announcement tonight. Uh, good evening everyone. As unexpected as this is, they also say it... Love comes in unexpected ways, right? That's why... I'm sure you didn't expect this. Yana, will you be my wife? Yes, Joey. I will marry you. Congrats! Alex, what was that? That wasn't in the plan. What happened? What was that about? My friend made a request. Your friend is my friend Chris' ex. - I didn't know that. - Yeah, fine. Just shut it. - You should have told me. - I said shut it, okay? Chris. You okay? You want me, don't you? You can have me. Just for tonight. You took everything from me. I have nothing left for myself. Give me another chance. If this is the only way you can love me, I'd rather you didn't at all. I would do anything to make you stay. Yes, anything. Anything but be faithful. Wait. Stop! Stop! Chris! We've been over this. You're not heeding my instructions. There's no improvement. Nothing changed. You're doing the same thing over and over. You're not in the moment. You're not here, actually. You're not with us. What now? Should we waste each other's time? You're wasting everybody's time. If you don't want to rehearse, just say so. You'd better be here when I come back. Take five! Take five! Jed! Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. What's the matter? Fuck this shit. I think I'm pregnant. Shit! Shit! Is it Joey's? Thank you. Your mango shake. Thank you. So... I think you should know... I'm pregnant. Fuck. Fuck. I wasn't gonna tell you. I don't expect you to take responsibility for it or anything. We're not even together, right? I just thought you should know. So what now? What do you mean? I mean, look at me. I'm not ready for this. Ma'am, the doctor will see you now. Hey, honey. What brings you here? Okay, food is ready! Start eating. You can have as much as you want. Yeah? It's hot and perfect. Hey, honey, eat up, okay? Hot soup with lots of vegetables. Go on and eat, honey. Ma, can I do this? What? This. Why not? You can do it. Please, it's you! Whose daughter are you now? Yours. Then there's your answer. But honey, I know how you're feeling. Because I went through the same thing. But look at the both of you. I managed to raise you. We can survive with or without a man in our household. I'm scared, Ma. Don't be scared, honey. Look, you have me and your sister. You can do this. Okay? You know, sis, I look up to you. Because you're badass. You know what you want. You're above the trends. Even though I know things do get difficult for you sometimes, you never let it show. You sister is right. You know, when your father and I separated, can you believe what he wanted from me? To leave you with him! Saying things like I couldn't possibly raise you while I was struggling as a theater actress. But of course, I stood my ground. I gave birth to you. I told myself that I can do it. I will raise my daughters on my own. And I'll raise them to be good people. I think I succeeded, didn't I? Jeez, Ma! Why are you making us cry? But I agree, but because not only that, Ma. We're nice, and pretty! Why, of course! Hey, you. You'd better not be like your idiotic sister. Don't... You know, sis, whatever you do, I stan you no matter what. It's gonna be okay, all right? Dig in. It's your favorite dish. Have some adobo, sweetie. Yes, Ma. Enjoy, guys. Jonjie. Thanks for coming. Where's Chris? Well, she's on break. I think I broke her heart. Oh, did you? No way! She didn't mind at all. She hurried home to check on the stove! Joey, are you for real? Who wouldn't get hurt by what you did? Even I was surprised. Which by the way, I haven't forgiven you yet. I'm sorry. You know, I did tell Alex I was having second thoughts. Didn't he tell you? Listen, Joey. It's not me who needs your apology. Apologize to Chris. I know. How is she? She's pregnant! Huh? How? She had sex, what else! Isn't this great, honey? We get to hang out again. I know. It feels nice to have company. Isn't it? I'll bring these upstairs. Okay, Ma. Will you be okay down here? Yes, I'll just be here. All right then. You don't need to know. Since when did you find out? Three months. Why didn't you tell me? Why would I tell you? Not this again. It's my child, too. It's Jed's. Are you sure? I'm sure. I know my cycle. You're sure or you're denying it? Joey, stop that. This isn't yours. Fine, if it's Jed's, where is he? Where is he? Why isn't he here? We have different priorities and it's okay. Then let me be the father! Do you hear yourself? I'll take responsibility for you, Chris. Stop being ridiculous! Chris! What?! I'd do anything to have you back. It's always been you. When we first met, when we fell in love, when we broke up, when we saw each other again, even though Yana was there, it's always still been you. You're the one who keeps slipping away. I wasn't trying to slip away. Then what? I'm pulling away. Is it because you feel guilty for what happened between us? This. This is why. This is why I left. You make things difficult for me. Difficult? I have been dying an entire lifetime without you, Chris. Every meaningless affair... And for what? I feel like I'm just slipping further and further away from you. I didn't feel anything until finally... Yana came along. If that's the case then you should be with Yana. We're damaged, Joey. We're so toxic towards each other. No, no... Just say the word, Chris. And I'll choose you. Any day, everyday I'll choose you. That's the difference between you and Yana. It's too late, Joey! Goddamnit, Chris! Listen to me! Choose me for once. Choose us this time. When will you fight for us? When will you finally face this? I want to. There's nothing that I want more than to be with you, to embrace you, to wake up next to you. But loving you is exhausting! I get tired, too, Chris. I get tired, too. But I never give up. I won't give up. You have Yana. She's good for you. Just don't let her go. Just choose her. No... I love you. You're the one I love. Chris. I love you, too, Joey. But it's too painful being with you. It's so painful to be with you. I can't. Hija. Hi, auntie. I'm so proud of you and Joey. Even when you were kids, I already envisioned you as my daughter-in-law. Thank you, Auntie. But how's Joey? I'm sure he's just tired. Overwhelmed by all this. Greg's mother used to tell me that I'm the kind of woman that men settle for. When the excitement is gone from the outside, he comes home to me for comfort, for love, for wisdom. I used to resent it. Because I know in my heart that I'm exciting, fun, and unpredictable. But as I grew older, I realized how blessed I am to have been that kind of woman. Men settle for women who make them feel safe and secure. Don't worry, Auntie. I know Joey knows better than to screw this up. I appreciate this so much. Hello? Girl, where you at? Girl, I'm at home. But later I have a meeting with some producers. Why? You don't need me today, right? You're busy. You've got a lot going on. You are a strong, independent, courageous woman. If I needed you I would have had your schedule blocked off. Wait. Is it today? Mm-hm, girl. It's today. Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Do you know I planned for this day? I wondered if I should glam up, stuff my face, go on a date... Fuck! But I'm at home working? I don't even feel a thing. What? Are you for real? It's fine, you can be honest. It's just you and me, no one's watching. Tell me, want me to blow up the venue and stop the wedding? Then we'll laugh our heads off while it burns. Would you like that? Don't be silly. No, I'm serious. Just say the word. I got some friends down here. What's the plan? Chill out. I'm just stirring it. I know you have a flair for the dramatic but the whole "Stop the wedding!" gig is overdone. Oh my god, so cheap. You don't like that. Just stay fabulous, gorgeous, then post a thirst trap on IG. "It's your loss, Joey Martinez." Can I get an amen up in here? Christina? Hello, girl? Girl? Christina. Girl! Hey, what are you doing here? You can't be here. Why? 'Cause it will jinx the wedding? Are you just settling with me? Forget I asked. But know this, Joey. If you choose me, you're not just settling with me. Because, Joey, I'm the right choice. I know you can't love me the way you love her. Hell, I can't even get close. But I will wait, Joey. Even though I know being with me won't erase her from your mind. I will wait for you. I will be with you until you move on. Should we bring these in? Go. Wait, did you get the right one? All right, bring them in. Unload the flowers, please. Are we missing anything else? Unload and bring everything in. Double time, please. Mister! Is this the Martinez and Santillan nuptials? No, ma'am. They're over at South Gardens. Bring those in. Are you sure? Yes. Thanks. Hurry up. Double time. Sir, let's try the chair. Sit down? Okay. Okay. Ah, five minutes. I just need to take a break. Bro, could you hold it for me? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just need to breathe. Is that okay? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Just need to breathe. Move. Joey! Chris! Joey! What are you doing here? Is it over? Is it done? Oh, okay. Good. Good. Why 'good'? Did you come to stop the wedding? Yes. No! I mean no. I can't let the wedding happen before we've had this talk. Okay... I guess I came here for closure. Go ahead. I want you to go through the wedding... with only Yana on your mind. Even though I know I'm still the one in there. I came to say goodbye. But I love you, Chris. I love you, too. Joey, I do. Then let's risk it. Fuck it. - Let's leave! Let's get away from here. - That's enough, Joey. Stop. We tried. We both did. We're not meant to be together. Chris... We're not meant for each other, Joey. I know you don't see it now, but I know, and I hope one day you will realize That it's Yana. Yana's the one for you. Enough about Yana. What about you? - What of you? - I'll be fine, Joey. I'll be fine. Trust me, I've been battling with myself whether or not to come here. And... it's easy to just slip out of your life. But I'm here. I'm here because we loved each other. I used to be somebody who loved all parts of you. All of you. So I want to propose something. Okay. What are you doing? Joey Martinez, will you... Will you be my ex? Get up. Christina Roxas... Yes, yes, I will be your ex. Okay. Go.
