- Move your ass, whore. Oh my God, almost, almost. - Choke me. - What? - I said choke me! - All right, you whore. I'll choke you. - We want the Natty Nocks! - Leave us alone! God damn it, wait your turn! We want the witch! Throw her out or we'll tell your wife. - Fuck! Fuck! - We want the book. - Go to hell! Hypocrites! - Take her to the yard! Let's show her what we do with whores. Get her! - Stop it, stop it! Leave her alone! - No, no! No! - Put her in the shed. She'll talk. Or she'll burn. - Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! - Wouldn't you like to know all their dirty little secrets, you bitches! - Put her in the shed! - No! No! Last chance. The book. Or your life. - I'll wait for you in hell, darling. - Die, Natty Nocks! - We can all burn together. - Burn the witch! - I'll come for every one of you! For your husbands! For your children! Damn you all to hell! Damn you! - Britt! - Sorry, sorry, running late. Car wouldn't start, again. - It's okay. Let's just try and contain the damage. - Britt, Britt! - What, what? - Natty Knocks nine times. - Very scary. - You really think so? - Hmm, speaking of scary. - Good morning, Misses H. Looking lovely as usual. - Good morning, Robby. - Britt. I'm here. What are your other two wishes? - Don't make me say it. - Boys are gross. - Yes, they are. I'm busy. Wyatt's outside doing Wyatt things. - What makes you think I'm here for Wyatt? - Uh, wishful thinking? Hi. - Hey. - Hey, Wyatt. I'm gonna be late again tonight. - You're late every night. - I'm trying to sell the Masterson House, okay. And I'm close. I know that it's hard, but I am trying. - It's fine. - Hey, hey, hey. When I close, we will celebrate and I will find more time for us. - Hungry, what do you want? - I'm not hungry. - Britt likes my mask. I wanna show it to dad. - Don't be dumb. Dad got married again. He doesn't care about us. - I'm not dumb. - You don't know anything. - Hey! I'm sure your dad will love your mask. - Babe, you've got to meet me in the parking lot before class, all right? I've got something to show you. Something really cool. - Robby, what are you doing? - Texting Britt a horny message from your phone. - Dude, give me the phone back. - No. - Give it to me. - No. - Give me the phone, bro. - No! - Robby, give me the fucking phone! Hey, give me the- - Oh shit. - You asshole! Fuck. - Good news. Britt didn't get that text message. Bad news, your phone is totally out of service. - Shit, my bill is overdue. - Who cares? - Dude, that's why you don't have a phone. They're gonna turn mine off on Friday unless I come up with 50 bucks. - Just get the money from your mom. - My dad bought me the phone. Paying for it is up to me. Where the fuck am I gonna get 50 bucks? - I know how we can score some cash. - How? - We're gonna have to ditch. - You guys are gonna ditch? - You didn't hear that. - I'm out, you guys need a ride? - Yeah, I call shotgun! - Not you, loser. Jolie, hop in. - No, I'm gonna ride with Wyatt. - I think you should go with Britt. - No, I wanna ride with you. - Okay, but don't screw around after school. I've got a trig test on Friday and I'm not cooking dinner later than six. - Are you guys really gonna ditch? - You better not say shit, little turd. - I go with or I'm telling mom. - She will too. - All right, listen, me and your brother got some plans. If you wanna tag along, you have to keep your mouth shut. - Zipped. - And you gotta put in a good word ofr me with Britt. - She doesn't like you. - Like that matters. - God. - I rode the back way past the Baldwin place and they're fixing it up for the Halloween house again. And there's like a shit ton of copper wire just lying around. - That's crazy. - Yeah, my mom's psycho boyfriend knows a guy who could probably buy it, no questions asked. I bet I could get a hundred bucks for it, easy. 50 bucks for me, 50 for you. - Damn, so that was your big plan? - How else are you gonna get the money? - Fuck if I know. - Wyatt, do not lose your phone. What if dad calls? And mom said not to curse in front of me! - That's great. Let's get caught stealing copper wire. She'll love hearing that. - Dude, that shit has been sitting around for weeks already. It's literally gonna take five minutes to reach over the fence and grab it. Look, I'm gonna do it no matter what. You're just coming along for the ride. - I'll be the lookout. - Oh, that's great. Oh, my baby sister is gonna be the fucking lookout. - I am not a baby! I'm gonna tell mom! - , what do you think? It's great. - That's great, Ricardo, but don't you think you're a little old for Natty Knocks? - We were told to have some fun, what? - Yeah, we're gonna burn the bitch. She sleeps with the worms under the ground. - Who's that outside? Don't make a sound! - Natty Knocks nine times, I know. - Natty Knocks nine times! Don't answer your door and close all your blinds. Hide under your bed or she'll take off your head! - What, are you all like seven years old? - I mean, we're all good here. Okay, just meet me here after school. - I can't, I have to get the kids ready. - Right, the kids. - Yeah, the kids. They're going through a lot right now. - So when can we expect you back on planet Earth? - Okay, go, go, go. - Look at it. That's 50 bucks sitting right there. - I thought you said there was nobody here. - There was nobody here when I came by this morning. - We should get the fuck out of here. - You're not supposed to swear. - Cover your ears then. All right, when he turns around, I'm gonna go sneak. - Not without him hearing you. - Okay, I have an idea. All right, Jolie and I are gonna sneak around in the front and we're gonna knock on the door. When the guy checks to go see who it is, that's when you go and sneak and grab the wire. - That could work, right Wyatt? Just like ding dong ditch. - Do you wanna keep your phone or not? I need you to be my wing man. - Sure! What's a wing man? - Just go up to the window and tell me what you see. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Uh, I see someone! - Go, go! Jolie! - It's too early in the morning for this shit. - What the hell? - Dude, keep it down. - Where the hell were you? - Your sister ran in the wrong direction. - Did not. - Did you get the wire? - Yeah, I got the stupid wire. - Then what's the problem? We got away. Jolie's fine and we had a little fun. - Fun? You should have known that guy was there. - Dude, you should have seen the look on your face. - Such a little bitch. - Hey man, lighten up a little bit. We did it, we're golden. You got the copper wire and you can get your phone back. Hey Jolie, you wanna do something funny? - Yeah. - No, she doesn't. - Yeah, I do actually. - Let's do one more. Let's Natty Knocks someone. - Really? - Hell yeah! Can you do it? - Yeah. - I think you could do it. Let's do... That one. - No, absolutely not! - Then you do it, chicken shit. - You're the chicken shit. Besides, it's a dumb ass idea. Nobody even lives there probably. - If nobody lives there, then do it. Yeah, bet you 25 bucks right now. - 25 bucks? - Yeah, 25 bucks, but you won't do it. You're too scared. - I'm not scared. It's just stupid. - Ah, dude. - Natty Knocks nine times, come on. Go. - Hold this. If I get caught, I'm kicking your ass! - You got it Stay here. Dude, knock nine times. - Okay. - Nine times, one more. - I think that was nine. Nothing happened, all right? - Holy, shit. - Dude, hide! Dude, where are you going? - Stay there. - You're fucking crazy. - Shut up, dude! Fuck, we gotta get out! What are we gonna do? - Dude, I don't know. - We have to tell someone. - Are you fucking crazy, dude? They're gonna know that we ditched and that we stole the copper wire. - Robby, we saw her getting abused by him. We have to tell someone. We should call the cops. - Dude, you are mental. No, they're gonna know about us! - We'll call from a fucking payphone, dumb shit. What do you think of that? - What's a payphone? - 9-1-1, what's your emergency? - I would like to report a fight. - A murder, it was a murder! - Can you repeat that? - Yes. A murder on, yeah, 715 Atkinson Street. - What is your name, please? - I can't tell you my name. - How do you know this was a murder? - We saw it through the window! He was beating the shit out of her! - Confirming 715 Atkinson Street. - Yes. Yes, 715 Atkinson Street. - We'll send a unit over to check it out. - Okay. Thank you. The cops are on their way. - Why, are they gonna get that guy? What's going on? - They're gonna bust his ass. Let's go back. - Are you out of your mind, dude? No, I'm taking Jolie home and we're gonna forget that we were even there and we're not gonna tell anyone that that ever happened. And so should you, dude. Get your bike, Jolie. - Fine. Whatever, I don't care anyways. - I don't know where else to look. I should have made Jolie come with me. - Okay, so now what? - I literally have no idea where they could be. - Probably just out like stealing beers or reading porn. - Yeah, Robby, maybe. But Wyatt, no way, not with Jolie around. - I don't get why it's such a big deal. You guys aren't even related. - It's important to me. - You're just the babysitter. - They're important to me. - At least someone is. - What does that mean? Wyatt? No, sorry. We still haven't found them. Really? Grace who? Rick, do you know a Grace Kinsley? - New girl from Florida. I walk by her in the halls sometimes. - She went missing last night. No, sorry. We haven't seen her. Yeah, I'll find them. Okay. Yeah, bye. Oh, geez. Maybe I do need a break from these people. - Thank you. Jesus. - Where were you guys? I have been looking for you everywhere! - Little shit. - Shut up a minute. I want to hear this. - You can't keep flaking on them. Okay, they need you too. - I'm starting over! - Jolie asks for you all the time! They both. - Lisa says that you do this on purpose! - Bye. Bye! Bye, run! That's the only thing that you're fucking good at! - Babe, why don't you go? I got this. - Want me to come by later? - Yeah. - You freak her out like that again, fist meets face, alright? - How long have they been going at it? - Since we got here. Like 20 minutes. - Where were you guys? Wyatt, you're supposed to answer your phone. If you ditched school, I'm telling your dad. - His phone's been canceled. - Canceled? - It's a long story. - Hey, I've gotta go close up this showing, Britt. Do you mind making the kids some dinner? - Yeah, whatever they're hungry for. - Okay, cool. Hey, I'm really sorry that you had to hear that. - It's okay. Let me take this. Yeah, it's okay. - We'll do something fun after dinner. - I just wanna to go to bed. - Let's take a live look downtown where locals have been putting up missing posters as concern for a missing Fillmore teen is growing. Here's Katie Hale with an update. - If you have any information regarding the whereabouts of Grace Kinsley, please contact the Fillmore Police Department. We have an anguished family that needs your help. I'm Katie Hale, Channel Three Eyewitness News. - Get off of me! Let me go! Let me go! - Mommy! Where's mommy? - She's not home yet. You're okay. - I saw her. - No, it was just a bad dream. - Why does daddy hate us? - He doesn't, he doesn't hate us. We just remind him of bad feelings and he wants to be happy now. - Are we bad? - No, you're the least bad person in this whole world. - I don't ever wanna steal again. Wyatt. - Yeah, me neither. I'm sorry about all that. It was Robby's stupid idea and it shouldn't have happened. Let's just forget about it. - How many was that? Wyatt, don't answer it. Wyatt, no. No, Wyatt, no, please. Stop. - Who is at the door? - I don't know. - What? Hi officer, can I help you? - Yes, ma'am. Responding to a domestic disturbance call, this address. - Oh. Excuse me. There's no disturbance. - Your neighbors said things were getting out of hand. - My husband and I are going through a divorce, so you know. - I'm gonna give you a warning, okay? Next time, just try to keep your cool. - Yeah, I will. Thank you. I appreciate your time, thank you. Have a good night. - Is everything okay, mom? - Yeah, nothing for you guys to worry about. Come on, let's go to bed. - Kill them for me. Kill them all. - Slow down. Take control of your hands. - What's wrong? - Try Grandma in the rear view. - You want me to go put a coat over her? - No, I want you to zip up your pants. - Come on, Britt. - Not a great times, stud. - We've been together for almost like three months now. - Alert the media. - You know how I feel about you, about us. I'm crazy about you, you're my girl. - What if we get all involved and then I have to leave for school? - We'll figure it out. - What's this? - Oh, him? He's your biggest fan,. You're gonna make the party Friday, right? Maybe we can try again. - Yeah, maybe without the witch. - Well, how about I pick you up at eight and we'll head over to Debby's and light the hag up, yeah? - Whatever you say, Romeo. - Mom? Mom? - Good morning, kiddo. - Oh, good morning. - I'm so hungry. - Well, it's almost ready, just the way you like it. - You know how I like it. - Can you guys not, please? - Okay, go get yourself some coffee, cowboy. And you better be doing good in school, okay? - Hey, I need to talk to you about something. - I don't do heart to hearts. - Got something you might be interested in. - Shoot, champ. - You know anybody that's willing to buy some copper wire? - How'd you get your hands on copper wire? - What do you care? - I know a couple of guys who might want it. - It's outside. - Five minutes. - Come on. - Anybody gonna look for this? - No. - Better not. - So how much? - I'll give you 20. - What? This is 100 bucks easy. - It's hot and somebody's gonna ask where it came from. - All right, you could do better than 20. - I'll give you 25. You don't want the deal, right? - All right, I'll take it. The money. - Seriously? - Yeah, dude, I ain't playing. Have fun. - Now beat it. Hey, we never spoke about this shit, right? - Yeah, whatever. - You know her? - No. Who is she? - Missing girl. Big reward. - Attention 10th graders, don't forget to get started on your- - Dude, I need to talk to you! - You ditched again. They're gonna hold you back. - Shut up and listen to me! - No, I don't want to have to cover for you every time you bail- - I found this. Read it. It's all over town. I think that's the girl. - No, you don't know that. - You know any other girls that have been missing since yesterday? - Shit. - Yeah, the cops didn't do shit. - What? - I drove by the house. There's no cop cars, no yellow tape. Nothing, they did nothing! - But we fucking told 'em the truth! - You think that matters? We're a couple of kids and it's almost Natty Knocks night. Truth don't mean shit. That guy killed that girl and we're the only ones who know. - We gotta find something on this guy. - We need that money. - But we gotta figure out who he is. - How the fuck are we supposed to do that? - I got an idea. Mom's in a showing. I don't know how much time we have. - What are we doing? - She has real estate software. I wanna know who lives at that house. What's the address? - Atkinson Street. 715 Atkinson Street. - That's weird. - What? - It's a foreclosure. The owner's not listed. - So? - Well, psycho is not supposed to be there. Nobody's supposed to be there. - So what now? - Well, I'll go to mom's office in town and search for records. Maybe find the last owner's name. They keep the records in file cabinets. It's old school. - I got an idea too. I'll catch you later. - Hey, what? - Choke me. Say it! So choke me. Say it! - Choke me. Choke me. - Hey, Wyatt. You think if we can convince this guy to turn himself in, we could still get the money? - Dude, did you not hear what I just said? - Yeah, your dad's a dick. They all are, I've had four. But this girl is face down in a river somewhere. This guy's gonna run away and then they're never gonna catch him. - Shut the fuck up with this shit! - Oh, shit. I got it, I got it. - At least he doesn't know who we are. - Hey, Lori. - Hey, Wyatt. Your mom's not here. - Yeah, I just need to get something from her desk. - Go ahead, go on back. - Thanks. - Wyatt? They said you were back here. Picking up some papers for your mom, hmm? - Yeah, hey, Mr. Meredith. - What you got there? - Just something my mom needs. - Oh. This old place, huh? Time was, not a day went by when someone wasn't stopping by the office to ask me about it. - Yeah, I just have to research that for a book report. - Why didn't you just ask your mom about it? - She's been a little... - Right, out of sorts. I was sorry to hear about the trouble at home. Come on. I might have some answers for you. This house, it's been a god damn tough sell for 50 years. Never had much luck with it myself. But your mom nearly did once, until the buyers found out. - Found out what? - To understand that, you'd have to understand who lived there. - Who lived there? - Miss Natty Nocks. - Natty Nocks? Like Natty Knocks nine times? I thought that was just an old ghost story. - Why, where do you think those stories come from? There's always a little truth to 'em. Nocks family around here, hell, go all the way back to the 1800s. Hard scrabble German folk. And Natty Nocks, now, she was the only child of a God fearing German farm couple. One day, they discovered her upstairs in the family home in bed with a boy and those good Christian church going parents of hers, they tossed her out on the street. - That's harsh. - Anyway, she took off for LA, hopes of becoming a movie star. And the funny thing is... The funny thin is, Wyatt, she almost was. You see, Natty Nocks, she starred in those drive-in movies, B pictures, double bill horror flicks, one right after the other back in the 60s. Yeah, she was pretty. Not much of an actress. And when her looks gave out, well, the movies stopped. She wound up back here with a young child. The old Nocks place had been abandoned by her family. They just kind of moved in. No one around this town had anything to do with her, or the boy. And desperate to make ends meet, Natty... Well, Natty became a, how do I put this? A good time for the men in town who wanted to live out their fantasies of being with a movie star. Of course, the wives in town did not appreciate Ms. Natty's local one woman brothel or the little black book that she kept all their husband's names in. Because of the kind of parts she played down in Hollywood, the women had somehow convinced themselves that she was some kind of a hippie witch and a whore. They tried to run her out of town. Oh, Natty was having none of that. No, sir. She refused and just kept her business busy, busy, busy, busy, busy writing down the names of all those husbands. And when she wouldn't tell 'em where she hid her little black book, they lit a tool shed behind her house on fire, Natty locked inside. A coroner called it death by misadventure. An accident, could have happened to anybody. Shouldn't store gasoline in a toolshed, they said. Blah, blah, blah. But people know better. I knew better. A town knows its secrets, Wyatt. A town knows how to hide 'em. - What happened to the boy? - Nate? Nate was institutionalized. They fried his brain with shock therapy to keep him quiet about what he might know, what he might have seen. - Shock therapy? - He died up in Butler psych ward around 2008. - Is he really dead? - See for yourself, Wyatt. They got him buried in a cheap box up in Oak Hill. - Who's there? - Are you speeding. - In this? - What's going on? - It's cops. - Is this about the copper? - Shut up - Is something wrong, officer? - Taillights busted and your tags are expired. License and registration, please. - Come on, really? - Officer, this is my fault, really. - I got a flat tire on my bike and I needed a ride home. - And where are you going this time of night? - I was at my mom's office in town. I was picking something up for her and it got late and dark and I needed a ride. We've been having a real hard time at home and Britt's been helping us out. - You Diane Hemming's boy? - Yeah. - I was up at your house not long ago. - Yeah, sorry about that. - Look, I don't wanna see this rig back on the road until the tags are clean and the lights are working. You understand? - Yeah. Thank you, officer. - Now y'all go straight home. And you, young lady, it's past your bedtime. - Are you okay, Jolie? - No, I'm not okay! Wyatt's phone got turned off and we needed money, so we ditched. Then we stole copper wire from the Baldwin house. Then they saw a man beating up a girl. She might be dead but nobody can find her because the cops didn't do anything! Dad's never coming home again. - What? Wyatt, what is she talking about? Is any of this true? - All of it. All of it's true. - We are going home right now. - I'm sorry. Who are you? You can't be here. - I belong here. - Nobody belongs here, not in her house. Not in her house! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who are you? Do I know you? - You know who I am. - No, you can't be Nate. No, no, no. You stay back, now. You stay back. You stay back, now! - You didn't try to help her. - Why are you hassling me? I don't know shit about no stolen copper. - I got a report of a black Toyota seen in the area. You know who drives a black Toyota? You, tough guy. - Me and a million fucking other people. Get out of here with that crap. - I've got a witness who says they saw a black Toyota near the high school. You wanna talk about that? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Don't you lay that girl on me. I got a cleanup job over there, okay? Do your fucking job and check it out. - You better believe I will. - Am I done here? - Yeah. You'll be back. - Hey Ken, I need you to run a set of prints for me. - I can't run unauthorized prints. You know that. - Look, it's the last time. Okay? Oh, third base line, lower level, row 12. Dodgers, Giants. - Fine. I can maybe have these by tonight. - I need it sooner. - They catalog every search. I have to be careful. - All right. You have my cell phone. Whoa. - Hi, can you help me? The front desk said that I was supposed to go back here, but I don't think I'm in the right place. - The right place for what? - I have information about a murder. - A murder? - The missing girl from the television. - Come with me, please. This way. Don't worry about the lights. They're fixing the place up. - Is this the right way? - Yeah. - Excuse me. Are you Britt Chamberland? - Yeah. - Detective Squares. The desk sergeant said you might have some information. - Oh, he was taking me to see you. - Okay, well, he's taking you the wrong way. Why don't she come with me? I'll buy you a Coke and you can tell me your story. This way. Brains before bears, Abner. What the hell's your problem, man? So the game is called Natty Knocks. - That's right. - I've got kids, but refresh my memory. - You run up to somebody's door and you knock and you run away before they answer. - Nine times. But my friend didn't run away. He looked through the window and he saw this creepy guy beating up a girl. He thinks it's the same girl on the missing posters. Well, we got a big problem with domestic violence. I mean, is it possible he saw a husband and wife thing maybe get out of control? - No. No, he's sure that the man was trying to kill her. - And your friend called 9-1-1? - Yeah. - So there's a record of the call in the dispatch order. - I suppose. - And you say this happened yesterday? - Yeah. - So why don't you think the officers made an arrest at the scene? I mean, what it sounds like, she put a hell of a fight. There would be broken furniture. This guy would have trauma on his face. And yet this man didn't leave in handcuffs. - Yeah, that's why I'm here. - But not your friend. - Yeah, well, he's scared, but he wants to do the right thing. Look, if there's a chance that this girl can be found, maybe she's still alive. I don't know. - The only thing I got from yesterday is a call about some stolen copper wire. - Well, I'm... I'm just... I'm thinking about the missing girl. She's in my school. - Well, listen, we're gonna look into all of this. In the meantime, I just want you to stay kind of close to home. Be safe and I'll call you if anything comes up. And there's my number, so. - Hi, Lori. Is Mr. Meredith in? - I haven't seen him yet today. He did leave something on your desk, though. - Do you know what it is? - I think it was something about the old Nocks House. - Thanks. You might wanna talk to Wyatt about this. What are you up to, kid? - Guys? Guys? - How'd it go? - I talked to a detective and I told him everything. They're gonna be all over that guy. - What about the copper wire? - I covered it up for you. Don't do anything stupid like that again, okay? - Is it over? - Yeah, everything's gonna be just fine. - Did that cop know who we are? - No, I didn't tell him your name. I just said it was a friend. - Thank you. - Can you stop being such a pain in my ass all the time now? You know, I'm only trying to help you. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Accepted. Now, your mom is working late tonight and I think we need to have a little fun. - I wanna go to the ghost house and wear my mask and reach into the guts and pull out prizes! - You coming? - I should tell Robby that it's over. - He's the one that got you into this trouble in the first place. You know that, right? - I owe him. - No, you don't owe him a fucking thing! - Uh, excuse me. Can I help you? - I'm so sorry, you scared me. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I thought you were a prowler. - Oh. That time of year, huh? - Yeah, every kid in town. - No, I'm Diane with Hemmings Realty. I'm sure you've seen our signs. - Of course. - Well, we used to have this listing and then now the bank has it. And I think there might be someone squatting here, so I wanted to just go check it out. - Well, I think I saw the back door open. Let's go take a look. - Oh, okay. Looks like somebody tried to break in. It was probably kids. I have two of my own. Should get rid of all of this junk. - That must mean something to someone. - Somebody without taste. - Somebody may be coming back for these. - Doubtful. Everybody thinks this place is haunted. - Do you believe in ghosts? - Me, no. No, I believe people are bad enough. They don't have to invent things to be afraid of. - Should we look in the basement? - No. I think I'm good. I've seen enough. But thank you for your help. If you are ever on the market for a house... - I know, I know. A house is not a house unless it's a Hemmings house. - Yes. - Thank you. - That's right. Thank you. - What is that? - I don't know. No idea. - What the hell is going on here? - Say choke me. - No. - Say it! - No! - Louder! - Choke me. - Louder. Louder! - Choke me! - Do as you're told. - Robby, what the hell is happening? - I thought that if I could get his name, I could turn it into the police and get the 5,000 bucks. And me and my mom can get out of this shitty town for good. - What are you talking about? - There's a reason why the cops didn't do anything, Wyatt. - What are you saying? - He's a cop. - What? - Yeah, his name is Abner Honeywell. - How do you know that? - I checked his driver's license and I saw his fucking uniform, dude. - You went back there? Are you insane? - I had to! - Tell me you didn't. - I threw that through the fucking window. But I forgot you're a psycho and put your initials on everything! - What were you thinking? - I thought that maybe if he knew we saw what he did, he would get scared and then turn himself into the police and then I could collect the money. - Dude, Britt went to the police station today and she talked to a cop. - What? - Yeah, she told him everything we saw. - What did he look like? What was his name? - I don't fucking know, Robby. - Money. - Yeah, it's a little late for that. Dude, we have to find Britt. - Remember the rules. - Don't move and don't touch anything. - And don't scare your babysitter. - Okay. This is awesome, right Britt? - If you say so. - Did you just pee? - No. - I think I did. - I told you not to scare your babysitter. - Abner, what the fuck are you doing here? - I'm working. - Working. Where's your duty belt? - Have you been following me? - I've been following her and I'm glad I did. You know, a pair of uni's talked to you recently, but you're good old Abner, three weeks from retirement. Everybody loves you. Well, I never bought it. I never bought you. Right, don't pull that Halloween shit with me. - She took Jolie to the Baldwin house! - Whoa. Britt, look how cool this room is. Whoa, that almost looks real. Britt, look. Britt? Britt, look. Britt! Britt! Britt? Britt? - Jolie? Jolie? Jolie! - Britt, where are you? - Wyatt! - What, what's happening? - I got lost in that stupid house and then I walked through the wrong door and... We're never going in that stupid place again. What are you doing here? - He came with me. - And you should know better! After everything that's happened, Robby, don't you think you've done enough? - What was the name of the cop that you talked to? - I didn't tell him about any stolen copper. - What was the name of the cop? Was it Honeywell? - No, it was Detective Squares. Happy? We're going. You too, Wyatt. Let's go, say goodnight. Stay here or go wherever, but you're not coming with us. - I'm trying to help you. - Next time, treat your friends better. - Fine. Go, see if I care! - Did you get in? - I've had it for two days. I'm afraid to open it. - What are you waiting for? - The minute I open this, everything changes. Who I am, where I'm going, who I'm with. - Rick's a tool. You know that, right? - Yeah, but he's a cute tool. - Look, I've never told anyone this before, but I can't wait to get out of here. Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll nab a baseball scholarship somewhere. But that's the only chance I've got. This is yours. Don't blow it. Well? - Holy shit. I got in! - Wow. Is that Rick? - Yeah, he wants to see me. I think I have to tell him. - You probably should. - Is it cool if he comes over? - I mean, I knew you first. - Yeah, since you were like seven. Hey, we're gonna be up late, like late, late. - Oh. Oh, okay. I'll be in mom's office and work with her computer while you guys talk and do whatever. - Thanks, Wyatt. Hey, you're a cool kid. You know that, right? And your slider is your best pitch. - Babe, we're burning the witch tonight. - Hey, I have some good news. Why don't you come over? Jolie's asleep and I wanna see you. - Just come over here. - I can't, Mrs. Henderson's working something out with her ex and I have to stay. But it's all good, just come over. - Maybe we can have like a party of our own? - Maybe. - I'm on the way. - Don't answer it. Don't fucking answer it. - Alright, keep your pants on. - Don't answer it! - You scared me. - I'm looking for Robby de La Marco. - What did he do now? - I need to ask him a few questions. - You have a warrant? - Do I need one? - If you want to get in my house. - He broke the law. - Prove it. Run, Robby, run! Run! You broke my wrist. - Where is he? - I'm gonna sue you for millions. Fuck you! What kind of fucking cop are you? - I'm a bad cop. Where is he? - Okay, he hangs out with this kid Wyatt Hemmings on Edgewood Road. - You're supposed to be asleep. - I'm kind of scared. - It's okay, close your eyes. I'm right across the hall. - Britt. - Yeah? - Why are there bad people? Why did God make bad people? - No one really knows. That's the truth. Sometimes it's a traumatic event that makes them bad or just bad blood, like they're born bad. - But why? Why does God make mistakes? - I can't really tell you that. But I do know that all that matters is that your mom loves you and Wyatt loves you. And I love you, and even your dad. Most people are good. Can you say that? - Most people are good. - Right, now go to sleep. We'll do something fun tomorrow. - Britt. - Yeah? - I love you. - I know, I love you too. Good night. - Oh my God. Abner Honeywell is Nate Nocks. - College grad of the future? Or the Avocado queen of Fillmore. I guess we're gonna find out. Just don't wake her up. Wait in the bedroom. I have something for you. It's freezing in here. Over here, lover boy. - Where are they? Where are they? - With their dad. - If you are lying to me... - I'm not. He took them. - Call 9-1-1. - Don't go down there. - I have to. - Don't leave me. - What? - They fucking left. He's got Britt! - Let's fucking go! - He's taking her home! - What? - To his mother's house. - You ready to do this? - Yeah, he'll kill her. - Hey, let's just hope you swing better than you can throw. - Let's get this shit, bro. I'll get the front and you go in the back, okay? - Good luck, man. - Knock, knock! I know who you are. You're Nate Nocks. Do you hear me, motherfucker? Nate Nocks. - What the fuck are you doing? - I came to help you. - Jesus, dude, I thought you were dead. - It'll take a lot more than that. - Hey, thanks for saving my ass back there. - Can't have your mom leave me. - Dude, you're a real piece of work. Hey, let's go get this piece of shit. - I'll fucking kill him. - Dude, calm down. - What the fuck? - He's with me. - What the hell did you guys do to piss of this man? - He's a psycho cop and no one's gonna stop him but us. - So what's the plan? - I'll go upstairs and you guys go up back to the shed. If you see him or Britt, scream. - Don't worry, it won't be a problem. - Let's go. - They locked you in a nuthouse! And then you started that fire and killed all those people! Abner Honeywell died, not you. Where the fuck are you? They dragged you out, all burnt up and covered in dirt. You made them think you were Abner, but it was just you, just you little Nate Knox. You waited. You waited until people stopped talking or caring about some creepy old story. And then you came back home as a new man named Abner Honeywell. You've been very busy. This ends tonight, fucker! Where are you? - Wherever you want me to be. Momma's boy. - Please don't hurt me, please. - Oh shit, is that her? - Oh my God, yeah, yeah. - Grace! Everybody has been looking for you! - Get off of me! Let me go! - Watch the movie. Watch it! - No! - Watch the movie. - Let me go. - That's right. That's right. - Look at it. - What kind of conditioner do you use? - Fuck you! - Britt! Britt! I know what they did to you! - You know nothing! Do you know what it's like to have a mother living inside you, rooting and nesting? She's a prisoner of all her movies and she is hungry. Well, mommy asked me to feed her and she said if I did, she'd let me go. So don't blame me. She's the whore! - Go get her up, get her upstairs! - Stop right there! Don't move. Don't fucking move! - Damn you all to hell! - Holy shsit. Come on! - Go, go, go! - Come on, we've got you. Okay, easy. - Wyatt, - I'm coming, mom. I'm coming. - What the fuck was that? - It's okay, it's fine. It's Grace. - He had her tied up- - Get the fuck out, go! Shit, fuck! Go! - 10-4, just wanted to know if you'd be headed back. - Mommy! - Oh, honey. - Are you okay? - I love you so much. - We're okay. Come on. - You're some kind of hero, kid. - Not so bad yourself. - How much is the reward, by the way? I'll tell your mom you're okay. What's up, bro? - What's going on? - You all right? - Not really. - Yeah, me neither. Where's Britt? - I don't know, she should be here. - What do you mean? She was right behind me. - Yeah. I mean, I saw her. - Britt! - Is she not here, dude? - Dude. Britt! - Britt! Hey, Britt! - Hey, is Britt over there? - No. - Is she still inside? Britt! Britt? Hey, Britt! - Britt! - Britt? - Britt! Britt! - Britt, Britt, where are you? - Britt, are you in there? - Britt! - Dude, where is she? - Hey, Britt, open up, please. Britt! - Britt, Britt, are you in here? Britt, open up! - Open up! - Britt, open, please! - Britt! - Hey! - Britt!
