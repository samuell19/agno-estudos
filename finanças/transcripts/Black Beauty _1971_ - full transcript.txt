[Neigh] [Rooster crows] Come on, duchess. Not long now. Come on, old girl. Come on. Right. Come on. Come on. Come on, duchess. You know dad had to go to the bank today. Come on, old girl. Come on, then. He's a beauty, isn't he, dad? Aye, he is. And he's mine, isn't he? You promised. Well, I suppose you could say he's all yours. My beauty. My black beauty. Beauty! Come on, beauty! Come on, beauty! Come on, boy! Good boy! Still, ginger, still. Good boy. Come on, beauty! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come here, beauty! Come here! Come here! Come on, ginger. Come on, young Joe! Coming. Oh, it's the hunt, Joe. Come on, let's see. We'll hunt, beauty, one day. [Horn blowing] Come on! There goes the young squire. Yeah. Kill himself one day, he will. Oh, I missed the hunt. But young Sam stands in well for me. He's keen enough on the riding is the young squire. Oh, he rides too hard. Why, it's a good spread you have here, Evans. Look, why don't you sell it to me, man? Become a tenant. It's better than borrowing. I'd rather be cock in my own yard. Think it over, Evans. I need a few good tenants. I've got enough bad ones. The loan will do. I'll tell my people to draw up the mortgage. Thank you, sir. No cause to thank one man for being more fortunate than another. I hope you'll be out of your trouble soon. Do you see Sam? I'm sure he's in the lead. I expect he was. 50 guineas I beat you to the stream! You're on, Roger! Come on! Ow! Get him off! Get him off! Hold on. Aah! Oh! Ow! How is the ankle? Broken. In two places, I think. Uh! Let that be a lesson to you. That's no way to treat a good horse. I'll give that devil a lesson. You've done that already. No! No! [Gunshot] We'll never go hunting, beauty. Never. I promise you. Come on, Joe. Come on home. Steady, boy. Steady on there, boy. Steady, boy! Steady on, boy! Ha ha ha! Come on. Steady! Good boy. Stand still there, beauty. Who's a good boy? There. Come on, beauty, let's have you. Up. Leg up, beauty. That's it. That's better. Come on. Come on! Come on, beauty. Come on. Come on! Whoa! Whoa! That beast's a menace! He's a menace! He's all right! It's his first time-- don't tell me, boy! I know a vicious animal when I see one. What he needs is a lesson, and he's going to get one. No! I'm sorry, but you shouldn't have hit him! This is a private road! Why are you on it? Squire said we could use it as a shortcut to our farm. I'm the new squire now, as near as dammit. I'll have you and that beast shot for trespassing! We didn't mean any harm. Get off! Get off, I say! Come on, beauty. Come on. Stupid murderous beast. Come on. Come on! Come on, boy! Come on! Get on, beauty! Get on! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa! Whoa! Good fellow. Joe, what are you at, Joe? You know that's not the way to handle a horse! He's young. The way you handle him now can make or break him. We ran into Sam Greene, and beauty got upset! Sam hit him with a stick! He said he's the new squire and we can't use the new shortcut. Oh, calm down, boy. Come on, calm down and talk sense. But he did! He did! He hit beauty! Oh, be quiet, boy. I'll talk to you when you're sensible. But he did! He did! Right, now. Tell US again--quietly. Well, he said he's going to be the new squire near as dammit. I do hear the old squire's terrible sick, not long to go. Aye, poor old fellow. Very different from the young squire. Aye, he's a right bastard, that one. He hit beauty. He is a bastard. Joe, watch your tongue! But you're right. He is trouble. Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. He fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of life, we are in death. Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, o lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, o lord god most holy, o lord most mighty, o holy and most merciful savior, deliver US not into the bitter pains of eternal death. Thou knowest, lord, the secrets of our hearts. Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers, but spare US, lord most holy, o god most mighty, o holy and merciful savior, thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer US not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee. [Bell chiming] Well, Joe, that's it. He was decent to US. Yes, he was. We shall miss your father, sir, very much. I'm sure many people will. He was too good-natured by far. I don't see how a man can have too much good in him. He was a target for every hard-luck story. Still, Mr. Evans, there will be no more of that. One harrow, two plows... Assorted implements... We don't have to check all that lot, do we? No. Not worth bothering about. No. Right, sir! Now, then, animal stock? This way...Gentlemen. Huh. Very nice condition, these beasts. Very nice. Horses? One mare--duchess. One gelding-- ginger. Ginger--got it. Right. A stallion-- black beauty. Where is he, Mr. Evans? He's not part of my stock. He belongs to my son. He's down in the books, sir. Well, he shouldn't be. Our orders are to check everything in the book. He belongs to Joe! I daresay you'll be able to make some arrangement with the squire. What's he valued at? 15 guineas. Whoa, boy. Good boy. Come on, beauty. Come on, boy. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Excuse me, sir! The black stallion-- I want him back! I'll give you 15 guineas for him. 15 guineas? Don't be ridiculous, Evans. Name your price, sir. Name my price? What will you pay with--buttons? If you could give me more time-- time? And how much will you require, Mr. Evans? 100 years? That place of yours will never pay, and you know it. I'll find the money for the horse, sir. Maybe Â£20, even. He is not for sale. I'll give him a good rubdown once we're back at the stables. All right. He's in marvelous shape. You should have seen him take the hedges. I want to talk to you, Joe-- he could race, you know. He could beat anything in the whole country. All right, then. Take him in... But go easy, now. Joe. Hmm? How would you like to live on a stud farm, nothing but horses? Marvelous, but I like it here. We've always been best with horses, you and me. Of course. Nothing much as farmers, though. But you're a good farmer. Uh-huh. A good farmer makes money. I never have. Joe, I can't beat around the bush. I don't know how. I've lost the farm. What? I've lost it. It happens. The blooming bank. The bank and the mortgage. No point in going over it all. I've lost it, that's all. I'd like it on a stud farm. There's no special thing in farming, is there? I've been offered a job in the north. A fine stable. I'd be in charge. Beauty would like it. No, Joe. We'd have to go as we are-- just the two of US. But we can't leave beauty. We have to. But, why? Beauty's part of the farm now. It's all got to go. The new squire's taking over. It's his. But beauty belongs to me! He's mine! Joe, let me try and explain-- he's mine, I tell you! He's mine! Joe! I'll come back one day, beauty. I swear it. You know I will. We've been waiting here over an hour. Squire's time, Charlie. Look at him. Wonder that rotten bearing rein don't break his neck. He likes his horses looking fashionable! You're a useless lot! Where's my trap? Waiting, sir! What the hell pig is this they've harnessed up for me? Name of black beauty, sir. Oh, yes, I remember. He's an ill-tempered creature. I'll change it, sir. No, no, no. Don't bother. I'll teach him. Get his head up higher, for a start. That's about all he can take-- I said get it up! Right, sir. Cloak. Come on, get it up! Steady. Whoa. Higher! Steady. He's not used to it, squire! The animal is a mite touchy. He'll soon learn to be less so. Come on! Come on! Come on! Get up there! Get up! Drinking, gambling, and killing off horses. Oh, it's a great life to be a gentleman. Whoa, there! Damn near ran away with me. High-spirited is he, sir? Yeah. Leave him harnessed. He'll be uncomfortable, sir. That suits me very well. Leave him harnessed! George! Get a blanket! Don't fret, old boy. We'll loosen you up a bit. Ah, there. That's a fine old sweat you've worked up there. There. That's better. [Laughter] [Man] How about a grape for the squire, then, eh, Sam? [Laughter] Right, gentlemen! Let's drink another bottle while Sam's working out his tactic, eh? Take your time, Sam. I think I've taken nearly everything else. Maybe we should call it a night. I'm absolutely exhausted. No, no, no, no. I'm perfectly willing to make it the last turn. What do you say, Sam? Let's make the last one really worthwhile. Whatever you care to call. Damn it, Roger. The stakes are high enough as it is. Please yourself. What do you say, Sam? Then you're short of the ready, aren't you? Even so... I'll wager Evans' place against... Against... Your stables on this land... And the horses. Now, what would you do, Sam, if you won 12 fine horses, eh? Whip them to death? [Laughter] Is it a wager? It's a wager. Play your cards. Ace. Ace. [Crowd gasps] Queen. Ha ha ha! [Chuckling] Ha ha ha! King. Ha ha ha! Ostler! Coming, sir. Ostler, get my trap ready. Come on, man. Come on. Just get me up here. Stay there, you beast! As you please, sir. Well, come on! Get up! Go on! Go on! Pleasant journey, sir. Hyah! Get up there! Hyah! Hyah! Get on! Get on! Hyah! Go on! Come on! Go! Get up! [Clanging] Stop! Stop, you beast! [Snap] [Neigh] [Man singing] [Horse neighing] Oh! This must be my birthday. There... Gently now... Easy now... Come to me, my love. Come to your new dad, my darling dear. Hey! Hey! Here we go, me darling! Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey! Hello, muldoon. Hello there. Hello, you two. Ha ha ha! Here we are. Hello! Hello! [People shouting] It's the muldoon! It's the muldoon! So, you're back from your wanderings, muldoon. I am back for good and all. 'Tis a great horse you're riding there. Pride of the muldoons he is. Let Seamus o'Flaherty look and him and weep. Ha ha ha! Seamus! Seamus, it's the muldoon. It's the muldoon, Seamus. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, you drunken idiot! It's the muldoon! Did you wake me for that? Ha ha ha! Get out of it! [Laughter] The o'Flaherty is asking why you are here, muldoon. I'm here for my crown, so go tell the man, and tell him clear! Give US a leg up. Now listen here to me, all of you. I'm here to race o'Flaherty over any course he chooses. And let the best man be king over all the muldoons and o'Flahertys, and let the distrusts and dissension between our two royal houses be so settled forever! [Cheering] [Crowd] Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! Muldoon! That's a terrible fine creature that man has there. Ah, so Seamus on his emperor is a match for the devil himself. [Cheering] Yay! Silence! Silence! Silence! Silence! It is understood the first round the black lake and to take the crown is the best man. [Cheering] Muldoon! Seamus! Seamus! Hyah! Hyah! Get up there! [Man] Oh! Oh! Blundering idiot! Heh heh heh! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Over we go there! Get it out of the way, you fools! Get up! Hyah! Come on! Hyah! Hyah! Ah, ye blithering idiot! Come on! Come on! [Cheering] Yay! Muldoon! Muldoon! You rode a dirty race, o'Flaherty, but still I was too good for you. Will you abdicate? No, I will not! Did I or did I not win the race fairly? [Crowd] Yes! Yes! I won it fairly in the presence of all our people gathered here. It's the truth. You've no complaint. Aye, muldoon won the race, but that doesn't mean the o'Flahertys are beaten. I won the crown fairly. You have nothing to say. Aye, but I have. Right, then say it. Right, I will! Ahh! [Crowd shouting] Mr. Benjamin! Mr. Benjamin! Hmm? It's a riderless horse, Mr. Benjamin. Go get him. [Whistling] Come on. Come on. There you go. Here we are, sir. All alone. Dear, dear. It's an awful shame to see a fine animal like that without a friend in the world. See if he has a brand on him, Dennis. Not a Mark on him. Of course. I recognize him now. It's one of ours, ready and waiting to be shipped. Must have strayed from the rest. What about the white Blaze, Mr. Benjamin? By the time he reaches the continent, he'll be as black as ebony. Tie him up. Come on. [Geese honking] [Goat bleats] We won't find anything of the quality we need here, Marie. Oh, look, father! Look! That's a possibility. He's handsome. He's a fine horse, he is. Brought him over myself. What's his name? Um, blackie he's called. Just plain blackie. Uh, he's in excellent shape, as you can see. How's his temperament? Oh, sweet! Sweet as sugar! No other word for him. Grew up with my son here. It'll break the lad's heart to part with him. Oh, in that case... The lad knows that his mother's operation comes first. That's why I've got to let him go so cheaply. How much? Cheap. Very cheap. Bring him over to the circus hackenschmidt. We'll have a proper look at him. Buy him now, father. I like him. Cautiously and carefully, my dear. Carefully and cautiously. [Marie] Come. Come on. Come. Come on. Come on in. Come on. Come on. Come. He's marvelous. A bit nervous, though. He's good. Very good. Why did that horse dealer sell him so cheaply? Maybe I'm the better horse dealer. Stop that, Marie! Save it for the performance. You know it makes me nervous. [Chuckles] Come on. [Woman speaking Spanish] He's going to be fine. He's been well brought up. There's something wrong. But he's in marvelous condition. Exactly. He was too cheap, too cheap by far. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, father. Oh, what does that mean? Ha ha ha! That means, my angel, that until we're out of the district, this horse will be playing in full make-up. You think he's ready? I'll soon find out. [Applause] [Crowd cheering] [Crowd reacts] I told you he was ready. You were right. Come on. [Dog barking] [Hackenschmidt] Over there! Get those ropes. Now, get a move on! Quick! Quick! Get the elephants. I said the elephants. Come on! Come on! Come on! Back here! Hurry up! Through there! Now! Let's go! Let's go! No wrong moves. I want everything to be fine. Everything's all right? [Woman] Yes. Good, good, good. Hurry up! Hurry up! Get a move on! The more often they do it, the slower they get. That's how men are. Father, why are you worried all the time? Worried? Why should I be worried? Costs are up, audiences are down. There's nothing to worry about. Everything is perfectly normal. What is your special worry today? Stomach pains again? Don't be ridiculous. Corns troubling you? No. You're losing weight. Sorry. Leave me alone. I'm perfectly all right and healthy. Then what's the matter? I know you. All right, if you must be so nosy, I'm expecting a visitor. Visitor? Tell me, what visitor? Does it matter? Who are you expecting? Lorent. But his lot aren't playing this part of the country. They are now. They've stolen our next date. We have got an agreement about dates. Mr. Lorent has decided to change the agreement. Can he do that? Let's say he's trying hard. Hyah! Whoa. [Horse neighing] Good day, hackenschmidt and the lovely miss hackenschmidt. We haven't been introduced to your friends. Mungo... Flying Fred. I've heard all about mungo and flying Fred. What do you want? I'll come straight to the point, hackenschmidt. I'm going to buy you out. There is no room for two shows on this circuit. I'll come straight to the point, too, lorent. The circus hackenschmidt is not for sale. It will be, you know. I doubt it, and never to you. Come on. We have work to do. Be sensible, hackenschmidt. The public wants danger and violence, and I give it to them. Your days are over. They don't like your pretty little acts. That's why you're losing all your dates. We'll be playing the dates we always have. I doubt it. Haven't you seen the posters in town? Myposters. We'll be playing there next week, not you. Not when there's only enough business for one. See you soon, dear lady, I hope. I hope not. Ha ha ha! [Lorent] Shut up! Ha ha ha! Get up! Go on! Go on! Get up now! [Ruff ruff] He's up to something. I know it. No. He's trying to steal our dates, that's all. But we've survived worse. Leave it to me. All right, boys. Come on, old boy. We both need some fresh air. Thank you. Come on. Aah! [Groaning] Nice to see you again, miss hackenschmidt. Let me down. My father will make you pay for this. He won't be able to pay for a small beer when we're finished with him. Very well. What do you propose to do? Well, if it was flying Fred, who knows what he'd do, but as I'm a gent and you're a lady, just come quietly, and you'll come to no harm. Right? Aah! Wait. Get the horse! Quickly! Hurry up. Hurry. Come on. Jump in. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Get up. Go on. Go on. Get up there. Ah! Oh! Mr. Lorent. Mr. Lorent! Ahh. I said we'd meet again. If this is your idea of a joke-- I don't make jokes. This is how I do business. Business? Yes, business. Here. As you see, I have it all written out. All you have to do is sign. You're mad. Sign it! Well, it doesn't really matter. Marie hackenschmidt. Signed in her absence. Mungo, lock her up in the stable. Yes, sir. [Horse whinnies] [Whinny] Mr. Hackenschmidt! Maestro! Maestro! Maestro! Maestro! Mr. Hackenschmidt! Mr. Hackenschmidt! Any news, gentlemen? One of lorent's mob! It's supposed to be from Marie. It says she's staying with friends. Signed in her absence? Who's he trying to fool? Do you think lorent's got her? Of course he has. She recommends me to sell the circus to him. Sell to him! That swine must think I'm an imbecile. Go to the police! Go to the police! No. If we do that, he may take it out on Marie. That's right, maestro. That's right, maestro. We've got to get her back ourselves. On the road, everybody! Move! [Excited neighing] Mr. Lorent! Mr. Lorent! Mr. Lorent! Mr. Lorent! What the hell do you want? Hackenschmidt's on the road. He's coming this way. He must be coming for a business conference. Right. Get our boys together. Wait a mile up the road. Hey, mungo! And what you can't destroy, burn. Go on! What are you waiting for? What about Marie? Leave her to me. Everybody! Everybody, get up! Get up! Come on! âª âªâªâªâªâª âª âªâªâªâªâª Hackenschmidt! Hurry up. Yes, sir. Quiet, you beast! Quiet! [Glass breaks] All right. You asked for it. [Cracking whip] Please... Come on. Come on. [Hiccuping] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Snoring] Mr. Commissioner, the queen! Oh, uh...Oh... Oh, my god. [Marie] Commissioner! Commissioner! Commissioner! Commissioner! Commissioner, the lorent gang are going to destroy my father's circus! It's desperate! Desperate? My dinner guest-- sir William fordyce from england. Cheerio. They're going to destroy, burn, kill! Kill? Right. It's a matter for the police. Come on! Come on. Come on, commissioner. Please hurry. Hurry up. Hurry up, please. Hurry up. Hurry up. [Thud] I think perhaps you'd better leave this to me. [Hackenschmidt] Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! It's all right. [Horns blowing] Right. Come on. You, too, men. You men, push up there, will you? One moment. After them. After them. Hurry up. Get along. Game, set, and match. Dear sir William, a toast to you and to the circus hackenschmidt. To the circus hackenschmidt. The horse did something, too, father. I'm very sorry, Marie. I cannot allow you to keep that horse. He's far too dangerous. He only attacked lorent because of the whip. Attacked him? Lorent is dead. That horse is a killer. I will not have such an animal in my circus. We'll have to get rid of him somehow. My dear sir William, I cannot tell you how much your prompt action meant to US. My daughter and I would like to give you this horse as a small token of our appreciation. We absolutely insist. We've made up our minds, haven't we, Marie? Well, you have. But it's too much. Please, not another word. Well, we must be off. On the road, everybody. On the road! Good-bye. Good-bye. Extraordinary. [Sir William] Ah, Anne. Yes, father. I thought I'd find you out here. Damn stupid little cur-- ought to be shot. Aww. Oh, you would, wouldn't you? Shoot the only friend I've got around here. It's all right, my dear. I didn't mean it. As a matter of fact, I've brought a surprise-- bit of a present, so to speak. But you never give presents. Well, I'm giving you one now. Jackson! Oh, what is it? You'll see. You'll see. Jackson! Jackson, here at once! [Dog yipping and growling] A present from the continent, my dear. Not bloodstock, of course, but he's a fine animal. Oh! Oh, he's beautiful! Oh, so beautiful! Oh, thank you! Yes, all right. Yes. That's enough of that. Glad you like him. Oh, get out of it, you horrible object. Damn cur. Go on. Out of it. Oh, look at him, gervaise. The horse. Father brought him from the continent. Oh, do look. He's marvelous. Gervaise, aren't you interested? In what? The horse. Look. Not at the moment. Anne, I shall have to speak to your father. Oh, no, gervaise. Not yet. So when? I don't know, but not yet. Father is old and alone. He needs me. But I need you, too. Don't go and see him, gervaise. It could only result in one thing. He'd forbid US to see each other. That's a risk I shall have to take. Please, gervaise. I'm sorry, Anne, but you must let me settle this in my own way. Don't worry. Well, sir, what is this matter of importance? Sir William, I will try to be brief. I am here to ask the honor of your daughter's hand in marriage. [Ding-a-ling] [Door opens] Yes, sir William. Lieutenant caldicott is just leaving. Yes, sir. Sir William, I must speak to you. At least consider Anne's happiness for a moment. All right, oakley. Wait outside. You have one minute. Sir, you knew my family. My father was your brigadier in Delhi. [Surprised] Jacko caldicott? Yes, I remember him. Mad fool. Penniless except for his army pay. Ended up with some French woman. French lady, sir. I was educated in France until I came here and obtained a commission in your old regiment. And if it's money you're worried about, I still derive a small income from the estate. Small income? Maybe enough to pay your mess bills, but hardly enough to support my daughter. Do you want her to live like a pauper? But, sir William, I love Anne. Love her! Love her bank balance, more likely. Now get out, caldicott. I love my daughter, too, and I regard it as part of my duty to protect her from fortune hunters like yourself. Yes, sir William? Show lieutenant caldicott out. Oh, caldicott. Your father--wasn't he at the battle of sedan? Yes, he was there. Exactly so. The twenty-eighth hussars, wasn't it? And did they fight at sedan? They were there. But did they fight, sir? No, they did not fight. Exactly so. The battle was already lost. It would have meant useless sacrifice, the senseless waste of hundreds of lives. Yes, I have often heard these humane excuses before. I prefer to call it cowardice. Cowardice. That's what I said, sir. I shall continue to say it of any officer who turns his back on the enemy. Good evening. Good evening. Rubbish, Ronnie. Have you gone soft? Stands to reason, if they haven't seen any action, they can't have any backbone. Can't blame them, though. Not their fault if we've cleared up all the trouble. Bit of a bother brewing on the frontier. Looks to me like those ruskies up to their tricks. Storm in a teacup. Be over in a week. Well, it won't be over in a week if we have to rely on this present lot. Backbone? A lot of young popinjays, if you ask me. You know, half of them seem to be foreigners. Steady. They shouldn't allow them into the regiment. I met one the other day. He was a frog. Yes, a frog! You'll be letting in the bloody hun next, Ronnie! Sir William, we'd better go. You'd never know he was a frog by his name. What was it? Caldicott. Yes, that's right. Caldicott. But he's still a cowardly bloody frog, all the same! [Music and conversations stop] [Glass breaks] Sir, you have insulted my family name. I demand an instant apology. Apology? For what? The truth? I have insulted your family name? Ha ha ha! Frog talk. Frog talk! Then I have no alternative but to consult my legal advisor. Legal advisor, is it? In my day, there was only one way for a man to get satisfaction. Like this. [Gasps] Just as I said-- a coward. Like his father! A bloody coward! Frogs' legs! Ha ha ha! Come on, everyone. Have some champagne. Fill up the glasses. Champagne. Come on, everyone. Champagne, everybody. [Music resumes] Think I ought to have accepted the challenge? Killed Anne's father in a duel? Protected my honor? Sir William can split the ace of spades at 60 paces. Even now, he's reputed to be the best shot in the country. Oh, I see. Exactly. It makes the charge of cowardice all the more convincing. So, what am I supposed to do? Nothing. Just try and stick it out. Oh, it was so difficult to get away from home. I'm sure father is suspicious. Anne, we must go away tonight. Tonight? Oh, but I couldn't. Where would we go? To France. To provence. I can't. What about my father? And your career? Career? My career's almost finished. Your father saw to that! If you had only listened to me. Anne, make up your mind now. Come away with me. But I can't, not just like that. Why? Why not? Because if I ran away, the shock might kill him. It would take more to kill that old swine! Gervaise! That's what he is. You must be mad to stay. He's a bigot, a tyrant! You'd be well rid of him! I'd give my right arm to be going out there with you. When are you off? Two or three weeks, I hope. God, I'd like to have another crack at the wog. When are the eighth off? Not for some time, sir William. Oh, I know one fellow who'll be rather relieved-- our frog friend. [Chuckling] I must disagree with you, sir William. "Our frog friend," as you call him, has already volunteered with another regiment. He sails for India tonight. [Gasp] Excuse me. Halt. Lieutenant caldicott. I must see him right away. It's very urgent. Private Simmons. Sergeant? Get the lieutenant on the double. One, two, one, two! Hope you're in time, madam. He's probably already at embarkation. I suppose this was the only possible answer. Yes. When do you sail? On tonight's tide. So soon? Carried you all the way? Yes. Every mile. Gervaise, I've got an idea. I want you to keep him. But--but I can't. You must take him. He's the one thing that truly belongs to me. I want you to have him. Just as he has carried me to you tonight, he'll bring you safely back to me. [Speaking Russian] [Speaking Russian] An ambush! Halt! My god, sir. Where did they get the Cannon from? Probably the Russians. Put them out of action. But, sir-- sergeant! Sir. Line up for charge! [Speaking Russian] They'll wipe US out. Not if we get them first. Charge! Aah! Charge! Charge! Come on! Aah! Look! Come on! Aah! [Speaking Russian] Attend to the dead, sergeant. Bury them with full military honors, all of them. Yes, sir. What about the lieutenant's horse? I think he's earned his passage home. How are you? All right? How are you? Fine bloody home for heroes to come back to. Sergeant! Sergeant! Get another bottle. No, two bottles. Sorry, sir. The landlord won't give any more credit. He insists on cash. Cash, cash, the ungrateful swine. Well, pay him yourself. Sorry, sir. All right, then. Sell the horse. But, sir-- you heard me. Sell it. He wants to sell his horse. He's getting on. Give you Â£4.00. Â£4.00? But you-- take it or leave it. That horse is a war hero. So what? All right. I'm not a mean man. Â£5.00, and that's my final offer. Ohh. How much did you get? You might say 30 pieces, and in silver. Ah. Thank you, ma'am. Come on! Come on! Come on! Hey! Get on with it, you lazy oaf! Go on! Give him a belt! Come on! Come on! Hey! Leave some for me. You're late. Get up. Get up. Get up, you lazy beast. God, there'll be hell to pay. What do you mean, he's dying? If that animal dies, I'll have your guts for garters. What can I do, Mr. Grimble? Make sure he doesn't die. He's nearly done for. Mr. Grimble will kill me. Can't you do something, Mrs. Grimble? I've given him a rubdown with me special embrocation. Give him another one. Easy, lad, easy. Best thing to do is to stand by him and give him a bit of consideration, a bit of love. That'll help him as much as anything. How's he coming along? Well, at least he's stopped that terrible heavy breathing. What do you think? Don't know. Looks as if he might pull through. He's a strong fella. I'll give him a touch more of this. There, there. Where you going with that? It's for the horse. I think he's going to be all right. Don't spoil him. We nearly worked him into the ground. Rubbish. He's lazy. I'll get rid of him. Get rid of him? I'll send him where he'll do a proper day's work-- the coal yard. Come on, there, you lazy beast! Who've you got today, then? Ginger. He won't last the morning. He'll be for the knacker's yard, then. Yeah. Ah, come on! Come on! Come on, there! Come on! Come on, there! Come on, you lazy devil. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on, boy! Whoa. Go on, you little devils! Get on off! Get off of me! Get off of it! [Bell chiming] Joe, what does everyone think about it? I think they're quite pleased, madam. But it's really so very little. Not if you're an old horse, it isn't. Whoa. Thank you, Joe. Morning, ma'am. Well, it seems to be quite popular. Of course it is, ma'am. When they're dragged from the hills around here, they're dying for a drink and rest. [Yelling] Come on, blast you! Come on, you beast! Joe. Come on, you beast! Stop him, someone. It's his horse, lady. Here! Here! Here! Here! Clear off! It's my horse. I paid for him with me own money. All right. I'll buy him. How much? You from the knacker's yard? How much? What'll you give? What do you think, ma'am? I think one day there'll be a law for people like you to stop your cruel and despicable behavior. If I were not insulting the animal kingdom, I would say you are little more than an animal yourself. Lady, I got a living to earn. All right. If you want him, you can have him. Unharness him gently. This puts me in a fine position, don't it? What am I going to do with this lot? Here. What is it, Joe? Nothing. It's just... Come on, old boy. Time to go home. Come on. Come on. Get off! Get off! Clear off! Aah! More than a month's pay. Must be barmy. "Given for the relief of the horses of this parish by miss Anna Sewell, 5th July, 1870." "All creatures are the works of god and therefore miraculous." Well, Mr. Evans, your lad's helped him make a marvelous recovery. Take him to the Meadow. Yes, miss Sewell. Come on, boy. He's always been fond of horses. You know, he's even given him a name-- black beauty. A bit grand for such a sad old horse. [Whinny]
