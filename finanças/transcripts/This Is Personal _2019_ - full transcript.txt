[indistinct chatter] [knocking on door] [pounding on door] [woman] Anyone home, Paul Ryan? [Tamika Mallory] If we could just huddle in close. I feel I'm in a spiritual mood. I'm in a mood for us to pray. We gotta raise our voices. [man] We come declaring that we will not let our people be dispatched, carted up and kicked out of this nation. [crowd chanting in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [police siren blaring] -[horns honking] -[officer in English] If you remain in the roadway and refuse to utilize the sidewalk, you will be forcefully arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. [continues chanting in Spanish] [horns honking] [speaking indistinctly] -[man] They lynched us, they sold us... -[crowd] Yes, yes. -...they auctioned us, they raped us... -[crowd] Yes, yes. -[man] They brutalized us, but here we stand. -[crowd] Yes, yes. -[man] Another generation. -[crowd] Yes, yes, yes. [Angela Davis] Revolutionary hope resides among those women who have been abandoned by history and who are now standing up and making their demands heard. Poor women, black women, Muslim women, -indigenous women, queer women, trans women... -[speaking indistinctly] ...when they begin to rise, the whole world will rise with them. [speaking Spanish] [in English] E-R-I-K-A A-N-D-I-O-L-A [woman] Go, Tamika Mallory! My people can't be in bondage and I'm free. We must stand and love and protect one another. This is how we're going to continue to fight for one another. We're gonna come out, be unafraid, and we're inviting everybody else to do the same. [upbeat music playing] I am officially running for president of the United States. [crowd chanting] USA! USA! I think the big problem that this country has is being politically correct. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering loudly] [Michelle Obama] To dismiss this as locker-room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. Do you believe in punishment for abortion? Yes or no, as a principle? There has to be some form of punishment. -For the woman? -Yeah. [man] Trump that bitch. -[crowd chanting] -[man] Yeah, that's right, lock her up. This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. Such a nasty woman. [man] Clinton is about a two-to-one favorite. [woman] It's really an amazing opportunity to be able to vote for the first woman president. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of North Carolina. -[reporter] Calling Florida for Donald Trump. -[crowd cheering] [man] This is us. This is our country. You're awake, by the way. You're not having a terrible, terrible dream. Also, you're not dead and you haven't gone to hell. This is your life now. [woman] Honestly, I'm stunned. This is how half of America really feels. Fucking Donald Trump! [indistinct shouting] [female reporter] Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating to protect rights many women feel could be in danger. [crowd chanting] Not my president! Not my president! Not my president! Not my president! [chanting continues] [train horn hoots] [indistinct PA announcement] [Mallory] This lady... -[music playing] -...my mother, is incredible. It went viral. Twelve million views. Yeah, she's something else, but seeing her like that gives me my life. -[music stops] -Yeah. I'm going to D.C. for the Women's March. Big moment. Really big moment. [chuckles] [speaking indistinctly] [Mysonne Linen] Tamika, she is one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time, and I don't follow a lot of people because I lead... ...so if I follow you, then you worth following. -[indistinct conversation] -[Linen] She's got the heart of a lion. [police siren wailing] [woman] And the war room is going to have about 200 people coming in and out, because this is where they're going to be picking up their... [indistinct] This started on social media, and it has been driven by social media. I want us to be trending on everything. [woman] Okay. [Bob Bland] When I got up the morning after the election... one of my friends called me and said, "Hey, check this out." She sent me the event of this Hawaiian grandmother Teresa Shook. [Teresa Shook] When I went to bed that night, I had about 40 people coming. And I woke up the next day, 10,000 were coming. After that, it just went ballistic. [laughs softly] [Bland] There were tens of thousands of people commenting... "All y'all ladies who are organizing this are white." And I was like, "Oh, shit, we all are." You know, because I had never thought about analyzing it based on that, because of my privilege. So today, we're going to talk about the Women's March, which we know as the White Women's March. White feminism has historically been mired in racism and has always been more about white women trying to attain the same rights as white men, rather than equality for all women. This white woman had said on our page that we're in this together. Since when? You know, 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. [Mallory] I got the call from the Women's March, saying we need women of color. They saw a photo of Carmen and Linda and I. People were like, "That's the image right there of what we want." I could feel that this was gonna be big, and we could not allow something this powerful to happen in this country, where the issues and concerns of women were being discussed and displayed, and women of color were not there at the table. And I went to the hospital to see Bob while she was pregnant. I mean, she was in labor. [Bland] Meeting Tamika and Linda and Carmen was amazing. These are women who are civil rights leaders. They've been doing this for 20 years. Yeah, I do wanna... [Mallory] We quickly said, "Here's how we make this work." Not only are we at the table as women of color, but we're making decisions of how the feminism movement will move forward. [Linda Sarsour] I think my existence in the women's rights movement in such a visible way is a challenge to traditional feminism. For me, feminism is about choice. I have the choice to cover my hair. Someone else has the choice to wear a miniskirt. But guess what? She's just as empowered as I am. [woman] This could not happen without any of these fabulous people. Love you guys. [Carmen Perez] What I would say to a young woman of color who doesn't feel like feminism has ever been for them... ...I would say, "We need you. We welcome you." [woman] Everybody ready to roll into Washington? [all] Yeah! [speaking Spanish] -[in English] There you go. You've got it. -Thank you. [laughs] You got it. [Erika Andiola] In the moment that we're in, there's more people that are starting to be pulled into taking action. The Women's March is really gonna be special. All kinds of different communities that are going to be there. They're sort of learning together. [indistinct conversation] [chanting in Spanish] [in English] Yeah. [crowd cheering] [Donald Trump] Today will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. [crowd cheering] [anchor speaking Spanish] [Paola Mendoza] So... if we... ♪ If we... ♪ -[Mendoza chuckling] -[vocalizing] -Sing away. -[laughs] I'm listening. -Go. -[continues vocalizing] If you want people standing behind these speakers, you've gotta tell me who these people are. Okay. All right. It might be a preacher from Alabama that never said he was coming that I might see and be like, "Oh, my God. You can--" Then, you're like, "I've got you a credential. You gotta come backstage." It's a show with a half a million people. It's gonna be more. [flight attendant] Ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived in Baltimore. I just want to know, how many of you are going to the March on Washington? [all cheering] [flight attendant] You guys are going to the Women's March, right? [all] Yes! [flight attendant] Let's get a round of applause for all the nasty women on board. [all continue cheering] [all laugh] [woman] It is our duty to fight for our freedom! [all] It is our duty to fight for our freedom! It is our duty to win! [all] It is our duty to win! [woman] We must love and protect one another! [all] We must love and protect one another! [woman] We have nothing to lose but our chains! [all] We have nothing to lose but our chains! -[Mendoza] Did y'all see this? -[man] Yes. Did you see this? Look. Look. [Shook] Oh, my God. [Mendoza] Look at that. That's a sea of people. That shit is bananas. Oh, my fucking God. [woman] I believe America is great, and America will become even greater, because we the people are in these streets. I'm here for women. I'm here for gays. I'm here for Muslims. I'm here for everybody! [all cheering] I've never experienced anything like this, and it's just been amazing to see people come together from all facets of life. We've been fighting for years, [voice breaks] but for the first time, I see that love still exists in this country. Ladies! We are about to start the show! [all cheering] [man] It's my honor to welcome the national organizers for the Women's March on Washington. [all continue cheering] [woman] America Ferrera to the stage right podium. America Ferrera. Get me America Ferrera. [America Ferrera] Our freedoms are under attack, and we are the only ones who can protect one another. [all cheering] I'm just putting the stuff on here that I think I need to say, -but I ain't saying none of it. -You won't say none of it. [Sophie Cruz] We are here together... ...making a chain of love to protect our families. [crowd cheering] [Angela Davis] At this very challenging moment in our history, we who are here at the Women's March... ...we represent the powerful forces of change. ♪ Say her name! Say her name!

[Mendoza speaking] My name is Erika Andiola, and I am undocumented and unafraid. [crowd cheering] I want to tell you about November 8, 2016, a day of horror for millions of families across the country who are undocumented. That day I get a call from the most precious person in my life, my mother, and she tells me, "Erika, I am afraid." I said to her, "You know what, Mami? There's millions of people who will be there." Hate will not be the norm in this country. Love will be the norm in this country. -Thank you all. -[crowd cheering] [woman] Tamika D. Mallory, age 36 and the mother of a teenage son, is a nationally recognized champion of the civil rights movement. Join me in a huge round of applause for Tamika Mallory. Whoo-hoo! Thank you so much. I am so proud to stand here with all of you today. Now, some of you came here to protest one man. I didn't come here for that. I came here to address those of you who say you are of good conscience. To those of you who experience a feeling of being powerless, victimized and abused. To those of you who, for the first time, felt the pain that my people have felt since they were brought here with chains shackled on our legs. Today, I say to you, welcome to my world. Welcome to our world. Dr. King said, "I will not remember the harsh words of my enemies. I will remember the silence of my friends." God bless you. [crowd cheering] [reporter] The first day of Donald Trump's presidency brought more than 600 massive anti-Trump protests around America and the world. ♪ They try to shut me down I've still got the power♪ President Trump's insisting that his inauguration crowd was bigger than the Women's March crowd, which is clearly not true. [Stephen Colbert] Either that's a lot of empty space or that crowd is even whiter than I thought. [audience laughing] [Mallory] We had so many people come together on that day. Women are not one-dimensional. We are not a one-issue community. I see these women saying yes. [reporter 1] Was that just a moment, or will it turn into a movement? [reporter 2] Organizers say this is just the beginning. [reporter speaking Spanish on TV] [Andiola in Spanish] [reporter on TV] [Andiola speaks, laughs] [in English] Oh, just a little. Mama will not give you a little. -I know. -That's... That's for sure. I was 11 when my family came here from Mexico. My father was very abusive with us. Ever since I remember, we were always moving from house to house, trying to hide from him. We applied for a visa to leave, but the fact that my mom didn't have a high-paying job, she was denied. And so my mom decided to take us across the desert to be protected from my father. The person who was bringing us, we found out that he tried to rape my cousin. And when we were crossing, it was really dark. I couldn't see my mom, and he tried to take me. I just started yelling for my mom. At a moment, I actually heard her voice back, and it just felt... I felt so much safer, you know, when I actually heard her voice. There's just a lot of people who are, even right now as we speak, you know, trying to cross the desert and, um... People only cross through the desert if they don't have a better way to survive. There's so much here. Every time my mom would see newspapers with me on them, she would pick them up and bring them to me. So, I started collecting them. I've been involved in the immigrant rights movement since I was in high school. In 2010, I met a ton of other undocumented people like me, who came here as children. I started organizing with them. People call us Dreamers. We pushed really hard on President Obama, and in 2012, he announced DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. [Barack Obama] Young people brought to this country by their parents, who do not present a risk to national security or public safety, will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization. [Andiola] This came out after DACA was announced. Really, really special for all of us who were part of it. And we all came out of the shadows. Which is kind of funny because I'm literally... That's, like, in the shadows in the picture. I'm back there, where you can't really see me. Dreamers became a lower priority for deportations. Basically, DACA gave us the ability to have a job and have a social security number, get our driver's license. But we don't have a pathway to citizenship. I think of myself as American. For me, the American dream is feeling completely free, that I don't have to be afraid of anything or anyone tearing my family apart or hurting my friends or hurting people who I love. [Trump] Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. [crowd booing] [man] We're affecting an arrest. -[man] No. -[woman 1] No, please. -You have no warrant. -[woman 2] No. I have a type of letter saying... -Get out of the elevator! -Everybody out. We're the police. We're immigration. -[woman] Can I speak? -You're out, too. -[man] Don't handle her. Hey. Hey, hold on. -[woman] Ignorant asshole. [woman 3] Because of people like you, our nation-- Honey, I'm calling ICE. [woman 4] I wanna see the warrant. [sniffles] [woman 4] They're taking my husband. And we have five kids. -[kids wailing] -Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands! -[officer 1] Don't move! -[officer 2] Turn around. Don't move. We're honest people right here. Rapists? [woman 5] That's ICE. That's immigration. [woman 6] That's not okay. Let him stand. [woman 5] He has a lawyer! [man shouting in foreign language] [woman 5 crying] You guys are not supposed to do that. You fucking pussy! [Andiola] Many people are going through a lot of pain. A lot of Americans don't really understand until you get to know somebody, until you get to hear their stories. And just recently, my mom got a letter asking her to show up to ICE, um, with two things, her passport and her medication. That's it. She could be deported. I became very, very involved in the immigrant rights movement. [in Spanish] [voice breaking] [in English] I'm sorry. [in Spanish] [woman] Wow. What a lovely group of faces here today. It is going to take business, civil society and government really working differently together to solve the world's problems today. [woman speaking] [Mallory] We are gathering to do an action. -How are you doing? Are you having the most-- -I'm doing great. We're getting ready to go wrap our bodies around Trump Towers right now, so that's why I'm gonna run out the door. Everyone's over there rallying and getting ready. -But she came here. -But I came here -to be with my sister. -Show support, yes. -United way. -This is it. This is it. We are really doing something. This is really something now. Yes. Yes. -Have a great day. -A pleasure to meet you as well. -Thank you for everything you're doing. -Take care. Listen, if I do, I'll call her, she call you. All right. [Sarsour] The movements that we are all a part of have always been led by those who have the most to lose. Social justice movements are not convenient. [Mallory] Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. [Sarsour] It has always been a concerned few who have made the most impact in our society. Do you wanna be that concerned few that makes our society better for all people? [crowd] Yes! ♪ I went down To the Trump house♪ ♪ I took back What he stole from me♪ ♪ I took back What he stole from me ♪ -[man] If we don't get it. -[all] Shut it down. -[man] If we don't get it. -[all] Shut it down! -[man] If we don't get it. -[all] Shut it down!

I'm about to get arrested right here by the Trump Towers building. -I'm just letting you know this. -[police] Leave the road. -[Tarique speaks] -[Mallory speaks] [woman] Black women are under attack. What do we do? [all] Stand up! Fight back! [woman] When any woman's under attack, what do we do? [all] Stand up! Fight back! -[woman] What do we do? -[all] Stand up... [reporter 1 on TV] Now, the NYPD said the four founders of the Women's March were detained. This is just one of many rallies that's being held across the country today to celebrate International Women's Day and also support the protest of a day without a woman. [reporter 2] On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers highlighted the inequities by stepping out themselves. We walked out to say enough is enough. ♪ Ain't nobody free till Everybody's free ♪ ♪ If you believe In women's power ♪ ♪ Come on sing it with me ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody free Until everybody's free ♪ -♪ Say what? ♪ -♪ Ain't nobody free... ♪ [woman] Is somebody free?

[Tarique speaking] -[Mallory] Hi, how are you? -[woman] Hi. So, what do you all do at the prom? Do you all dance? That's what we did. You dance. Let me show you how. Let me show you a dance. Tarique, come back. Tarique, let me show you. Let me show you a dance. How you dance tonight when you take your girl. Dance, and you gonna hold her. And then you dip, Tarique. Dip her. You remember when you was a little boy, I used to get all your stuff together for you? Yeah. Oh, my God. Tarique is like a son to my husband and I, and a grandson. And I'm very proud of him. I know Tamika's away a lot, and so it takes the whole family to try to help raise him. -[woman] More? -[Mallory] Yeah. My most vulnerable space in my life, the thing that if I get to really talking about it and trying to figure it out, it's my son. Time to go to the prom. Time to put on my flip-flops. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I love you. [woman] Do you have your phone? You have money? And, hey, listen. When you feel like this is not right, all you've got to do is just push it down a little bit. But right now, I got it right. But I'm just saying. -[woman] Wait. I want a picture of both of you. -Oh, yeah. And he's a good kid. But just being a young black man, God forbid, anything can happen to you any time. And it's really worrisome, especially 'cause I've already experienced trauma I have to live with. I was 21... when my son's father was murdered. It was rough. From what I'm told, he got involved with selling drugs or guns, and these two guys beat him, and they shot him. The movement became my own at that moment, because I realized that while I wanted to see that justice was done for my son's father, there were socioeconomic issues at play that made someone pick up a gun and shoot him in the first place. There's more than one person that becomes the victim. There are two families and a community of people who are impacted by the loss of life of one. Gun violence must be a part of our feminism. It's not just women's issues, it's the issues that women care about. We must wrap our arms around this mother at this time. Her son, her 4-year-old baby was shot and killed. I find myself just in it every time, whether it was police violence or community violence, just trying to help people piece together their lives. That's the work that I've been doing for over 20 years. [Andiola speaking Spanish] [Andiola] The attorney said that there's a claim for asylum. She is a refugee. It's not just about being in a country where there's war. Women who had suffered extreme violence like her are also refugees. [both speaking Spanish] [Andiola] We've dealt with immigration, with ICE, for a really long time. I have come really close to losing my mom before. Hello. My name is Erika. [sniffles, sobbing] My mother and my brother were just taken by immigration. They just came to my house and they just took them. They just took them, and they didn't want to tell me why. They just said that they needed to go because they were here illegally and that they shouldn't be here. And this needs to stop. We need to do something. We need to stop separating families, and this is real. This is so real. [sobbing] I made a YouTube video. To me, it was, "How do I stop her deportation?" And I said, "For now, just don't think of yourself as the daughter. You are Erika the activist, and you know what to do." We held a conference call with 20 different organizations around 2 a.m. Asked them to send petitions. By around 9 a.m, we had about 60,000 views on YouTube, thousands of petitions signed, thousands of calls made to ICE. The momentum got so big overnight that someone in D.C. made the call. [reporter] She came close to being deported today, but we were there when things took a different turn. [Andiola sobbing] I'm sorry, Mami. [all continue sobbing] [Andiola] Around the time when my mom got into this deportation process, she was diagnosed with cancer, breast cancer, and diabetes, so I told her to stop working, and since then I've been the breadwinner of the house. I'm the political director of an organization called Our Revolution. I've been really blessed and privileged to be able to work to provide for my mom. ♪ He's a nasty neo-Nazi ♪ ♪ Naughty nasty He's your guy ♪ ♪ A real-life puppet Of the NRA ♪ [woman 1] Tamika. [woman 2] Gun violence and school shootings is gang violence and it's police brutality. The problem is, the NRA is so focused on money that they don't realize every day another mother or father loses their child. [crowd] Hey, hey. Ho, ho. The NRA has got to go. [crowd] Hey, hey. Ho, ho. The NRA has got to go! They use their media to assassinate real news, they use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler, all to make them march, make them protest, make them smash windows, burn cars, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. The only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. [Mallory] The NRA is responsible for gun owners. They should be doing nothing more than speaking about safety versus giving any type of insightful message that could, in fact, hurt or damage someone. [man] To every member of the violent left who's having a meltdown over Dana Loesch's NRA ad... I'm talking to you, Tamika Mallory... get over it and grow up. We stand firm with a clenched fist of truth. [reporter] Okay, this is video from just moments ago in Charlottesville, Virginia where white nationalists are clashing with protesters. Apparently, the white nationalist groups are throwing full bottles of water. Earlier, they used brass knuckles and bats to attack members of the clergy, to attack members of Black Lives Matter. [crowd chanting] Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! [clamoring] [reporter] Police are still working the scene here where the fatal accident occurred. This driver came plowing into a crowd of counter-protestors, people went flying in every direction. We had at least one fatality here. [Trump] We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides. [Mallory] White supremacy and the violence that goes along with it, it's embedded in the foundation of America. Under Trump's administration, people feel emboldened. They feel like there's an allowance to abuse and harm people of color, Jewish folks, women. It's something we can't accept. [cell phone chirps] We gotta hit the streets on this. [woman speaking indistinctly] [cell phone chirps] Over the last few days, the death threats are getting more and more intense. So, when someone says that they signed up yesterday and they've got all access in a day, that makes me feel very nervous. [Sarsour] Sometimes what they'll do is have fake press credentials. You may not know a real press credential from a fake press credential. There are people who don't like the work that we're doing and they want to take us out. So, again, keep yourself safe. [man] One of the organizers of last January's Women's March is planning a new protest. This time, specifically targeting the National Rifle Association. We are America. We're going to be a majority-minority country. Here's a movement that's being led by... Three out of the four visible faces are women of color. We reflect this new generation of diversity that they've been trying to fight for decades in this country. [Mallory] Linda. Linda. [woman speaking] [Mallory] What would be best is that the counter-protestors stay on their side and we stay on our side. -[officer] We would prefer that, okay? -Mmm-hmm. [officer] But unless things start getting heated, under the law, we can't force that. [Mallory] We won't know it's heated until it's heated -and that may be too late. -[officer] And we won't-- [woman] And also, they're armed, and we wanna make sure... [officer] Well, the law in Virginia allows them, as long as they have a permit. We understand that. We understand that. We will take action against anybody who's violating the law. [Mallory] I mean, everybody, news stations all out. Everybody out. Everybody out. I wanna thank the creator for bringing us here today to stand up against the establishment of the NRA. I wanna pray for the children that are being killed by senseless violence. I wanna pray for the families, the mothers, the fathers, the siblings. I wanna pray for your son. [mouthing] And I think my heart hurts because I can't protect you. [sniffles] [voice breaking] I can't take away your pain. But I hope that we are protected today, and as we march, we remember that we've got each other. -Yeah. -I love you guys. We've got each other. [all chanting] Hey, hey. Ho, ho. The NRA has got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. The NRA has got to go! I want everybody to say, "I don't have the right to do nothing." [all] I don't have the right to do nothing. I stand and talk with a legend and I equally listened. He told me how he marched with Dr. King because he believed in his mission. He invested his money and his time to change our people's conditions. We've gotta carry his torch. You see, this is our time. So, when my feet get weary and I can no longer run, I think about the innocent people of this country that die by the gun and say I don't have the right to do nothing. [conversing in Spanish] [sighs deeply] [reporter in English] Tamika Mallory, co-organizer of the Women's March is demanding answers from American Airlines after she was removed from a flight going to her home in New York. Tamika says she used a kiosk to switch her seat. However, when she got to the gate, the ticket failed to reflect the changes. Now, instead of trying to accommodate Mallory, who is a platinum flyer of American Airlines, the pilot, who is white, decides to exert what Tamika describes as his white male power. The pilot, a white man, first words that he said to me... was I going to behave? I told him, "Yes. [chuckles] Yes, master, I can behave." And he points at me. "Her, off." A white man in first class pops up and says, "I'll go sit in the back of the plane and allow her to sit in my seat." They then come back with the cops. Six or seven cops. And trust and believe, I'm not crying because I'm weak. I'm crying 'cause I'm angry and I'm a fighter and I will not lay down. You better believe they will not get away with throwing me off of that plane today, 'cause I didn't do a goddamn thing to deserve it. Nothing. [reporter] It has happened again. What appears to be another erroneous 911 call made about a black person doing something that would ordinarily be deemed mundane. A family from New Jersey says they were kicked off that flight to Vegas over a birthday cake. [reporter] This white student called police on a black graduate student who fell asleep while writing a paper in the dorm's common area. It's a female African American. [woman] Black. No, I'm not African American. I'm black. Black isn't a bad word. Are you saying that inherently black people make white people feel nervous and that would call them to call the police more often-- Well, the reason why... The reason why we have so many rushes to judgement is because my skin is the weapon. [reporter] A police officer has now been charged with manslaughter after going into the apartment she thought was hers. It was her neighbor's. She shot him in the chest and killed him. [Mallory] We are living in perpetual anti-blackness. It's like my skin is black, I could die. That's why the work that I do is all about ensuring that whatever happens, we're looking to stop it from happening to someone else. [woman] America's oldest and largest civil rights group is warning black passengers about flying with American Airlines. [Mallory] I will not stop fighting, making sure that those people who were not heard are heard. [man] Yeah, you can. [laughter] -[woman] And what grade are we going to? -[Skylar] Sixth. -[woman] And we're getting promoted? -Yes. -[woman] Yeah! -[applause] This is our future right here. This is what Tamika is doing it for, for someone like her. I wanna be an activist and I wanna be a police officer, which my mom does not want me to be. You want to be an activist police officer? -[Skylar] Yeah. -[man] That's right. She wants to be on both sides. I want to be a police officer to maybe change the world a little bit. [man] That's right. You're right, Skylar. Whatever you be, you know, you should be an activist along with it. You could be a doctor, be an activist doctor, you know? [woman] What's up? -[Mallory] Hey. -Hey. [woman] Hey, Tarique. [Mallory] What's going on? Happy Father's Day. [kissing] [indistinct conversation] [woman] Oh, yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lord, for this food I'm about to receive. My bounty through Christ, our lord. Amen. I got accepted to around 17 schools, something like that. I got accepted to a lot of schools. Some I got pretty much full scholarships to. I want to either be in fashion or the music industry, whatever it may be, to use my platform to influence younger people. Like, that's what my mom does now. So... [Nadine] Even though she grew up in the projects, she didn't become a product of the projects. To see her get a million women together for a march and she be the head front of that is nothing more than phenomenal. And looking at the news and what you see going on, there has to be better, something different. Something has to change. Maybe Tamika will be that change. That's what we all hoping for. [line ringing] [Lupita speaking Spanish] [Andiola in Spanish] [in English] Oh, my God! [in Spanish] -[laughs] -[dog barking] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [in English] Oh, my God! [exclaiming] [all chanting in Spanish] [Spanish song playing] [inaudible] [Andiola in English] I'm gonna be speaking at the Women's Convention. Linda Sarsour, Tamika and a couple of others are working really hard on this. And there I am. [laughs] It's really cool. I mean, I'm really happy because there's so many amazing women and the majority of them are women of color. A lot of them who I know and really love and respect. [reporter] Thousands of women from the movement are descending upon Detroit for the first-ever Women's Convention. Coming as allegations of sexual harassment against producer Harvey Weinstein have rocked Hollywood, some see this global strategy session as the perfect opportunity to talk about the issues. [crowd cheering] [Mallory] Look at all of you who have shown up here this morning. I'm happy to be with you. We are in this movement together. We have a lot to do. Recently, we heard about this Me Too campaign and people went crazy as if it was the first time that it had been said. And so we brought a woman here today. She started the Me Too campaign ten years ago. A black woman. Ms. Tarana Burke. [crowd cheering and applauding] [Burke] Over the last two weeks, we've watched the phenomenon that is hashtag, Me Too sweep across the world. We come as a united community of survivors ready to topple the systems that allow sexual violence to flourish. [cheers and applause] I'm really excited about trying to fix and try to be a part of the solutions, especially after the Women's March. I believe there is a sisterhood and that, as women, we all have to stick together and help one another and build one another up. [crowd cheering and applauding] [Maya Wiley] We live in a country that has produced so much trauma across so many communities and I think that sometimes it's very hard to work together because of the trauma experiences that we all carry. -[all applauding] -Stosh. [Stosh Cotler] People who are white Jews like myself, although it is important to say that the Jewish community is a multiracial community, we've experienced thousands of years of murder and displacement and genocide, and so right now, while it looks like someone like myself is safe, we also know that it is precisely when it appears the safest that we are at the greatest risk. [Zahra Billoo] I would say that the challenge can sometimes be that if my people are dying, it's hard to stop and say, "What's going on with DACA? What's going on with healthcare? What's going on with anti-Semitism?" [Andiola] I mean, sometimes we do have those blind spots, and that's why it's important that, you know, we have women who are willing to come and be really strong and be, you know, really upfront and say, "You're missing my voice," or, "You're missing the voice of my mother or the voice of the people that I love." -[applause] -[woman] Thank you, everyone. [applause continues] [conversing in Spanish] [Jeff Sessions] Good morning. I'm here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded. [reporter] Current Dreamers' legal status will expire on a rolling basis. Once their protections end, Dreamers can be deported like any other undocumented immigrant. [Andiola] We're getting ready to do an action to try to put more pressure on the Democrats. There's gonna be seven DACA folks risking arrest. We are going to be pulling a hunger strike as well. At this moment, I really hope that those people who have been on the streets for the Women's March can also be there for some of us who are the most vulnerable. If nothing happens in Congress, I could get deported. [speaking Spanish] [woman] We're in Washington, D.C., where DACA recipients will be going to address Senator Schumer. [Andiola] We really need somebody to talk to him right now and to make a public statement today, because this can't wait. We're going to sit here and we're not only gonna be arrested but they're gonna take us to jail, and we're willing to do that today, even though... [voice breaking] our families are here today. My mother is here. For a lot of us in the undocumented community, going to jail is really scary. We're willing to take that risk because this is a time to act. Anything that you do really helps us, even if it's just picking up the phone and making a call right now to Senator Schumer. [officer] Clear this area. Clear this area, folks. Clear out this area, folks. Let's go. Back up. Back up. [youths singing indistinctly] [reporter] Undocumented youth are getting arrested at this moment. They need your help. [female reporter] This morning, the president is facing mounting criticism. [all chanting] Donald Trump has got to go! -Hey, hey! Ho, ho! -[reporter 1] The backlash is building. [reporter 2] Rally for Dreamers in Omaha. [reporter 3] Rally happening in Phoenix. [reporter 4] They're supporters of DACA, recipients of DACA, friends and family of people who are here because of DACA. [reporter 5] Medical students, residents, and professors say they wanted to come together to show DACA students that they care about them. [reporter 6] A Jewish-led coalition came by the hundreds for a peaceful takeover of the US Congress. [Sarsour] I am ashamed as an American. We are people that are compassionate. We can say yes to a Dream Act. [reporter] Hundreds of protesters descended on the offices of more than a dozen lawmakers for the young immigrants known as Dreamers. Unless you are Native American, you are an immigrant. This country was founded based on immigration. I feel inspired, but it's also so sad that we have to be doing this. No shit. [Chelsea Handler] I would like to apologize on behalf of the entire Trump administration. We're sorry for making it clear that white supremacists and Nazis are welcome in this country while young, hard-working immigrants, brought here as children, are not. It's our duty to fight for our freedom! [Chuck Schumer] Congress has an ability and an obligation to act, which is why we, today, are calling on Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to immediately put the Dream Act on the floor for a vote in the House and Senate. [cheers and applause] [Louis Farrakhan] Have you noticed the women's movement today? [congregation] Yes, sir. Something is going on in the world [congregation] Yes, sir. Tamika Mallory, I think she's here somewhere. Where? Oh, there she be. [applause] [inaudible] [reporter] I want to turn to some news on Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He went on an anti-Semitic rant during a major speech. Farrakhan railed against Jewish people at an event. He said they created apartheid and were causing black men to become gay through the use of marijuana. He claims that, quote, "White folks are going down," unquote, and that time's up for, quote, "Satanic Jews," unquote. [man] Louis Farrakhan has been known for anti-Semitic rhetoric for decades. [man 2] I've covered the resurgence of anti-Semitism on the right, but here's a leader with allies on the left. [reporter] Tamika Mallory's come under fire for attending a Saviours' Day service and praising him in social media posts. [newscaster] And a Twitter user says, "Tamika Mallory is on the wrong side of a bright moral line." People who are supporting the Women's March, what are they out there supporting for? Equality and all this stuff. And that is the opposite of equality. It's problematic, and I think that it's going to blow up in their faces in the end here. So, should she say, I do not agree with this hateful rhetoric from Farrakhan. She should speak out firmly against it. She has to distance herself. She has to come out against hate. We'll come back... We'll decide her fate when we come back. [woman speaking] I don't know, yo. I mean, right now I'm in deep, deep thought about this. This is very, very serious. [woman speaking] [Mallory speaking] [cell phone chirps] [Mallory] It was only a matter of time before I got hit specifically with the Farrakhan factor. And my mom saw it coming. When she knew that I was on my way, she started saying, "Maybe you shouldn't go." And I said "Ma, what do you mean? We've been going. You know? What am I supposed to do now? Start separating myself from... the people that I've been working with and the people who have helped me to get to where I am? What am I going to do?" And she's like, "Well, okay." [Voncile] The world needs Tamika because Tamika's honest. Tamika love people. It's not about one or this. She loves her people. She loves all people. And she cares, you know. She cares about people, you know. She was raised that way. [Mallory] I was born and raised in Harlem, and my parents were always social justice advocates. If it had to do with black empowerment, we were there. [Stanley] I used to get up early every Saturday morning. We would have an action rally. She wouldn't wanna get up, but I'd make her get up and go. [Mallory] For me, when I was young, it was like a curse. I just wanted to do regular things, and I rebelled. By the time she reached, like, 13, she started to stray a little bit. We had problems with her. Yeah, we had problems. When I was a kid, I wanted to be married to a drug dealer. When I was a kid growing up in the projects, I wanted to be married to a drug dealer 'cause I thought that was how I was going to get fancy cars and clothes and those things. That's what I saw. That's what I knew. My parents looked like they were struggling. I didn't want that. [Voncile] It was like we was losing our child. We didn't know what to do. I thought, "Just give her a spanking," and that was going... Just to be tough. It didn't work. [Mallory] My parents couldn't find me. I was a runaway. And I had a lot of men take advantage of me because I needed a place to stay. You know, friends, girlfriends, that only lasted but for so long, and then, after a while, I had to figure out another plan. So, you know, a lot of older men had their way. [Voncile] No one was listening to her. I see this today. If someone had just sat down and had a conversation with her and not about her. That's what we was doing. We was just talking. Tamika, Tamika, Tamika. [Mallory] When I had my son, everything changed. [Voncile] I wasn't easy. I made her wash the diapers and whatever she had to do. I was like, "I'm not doing it. You gotta do it." [Mallory] For two years, I was doing it kind of with my son's father, sort of off and on. And then he died. I felt so bad for Tamika because she was on her own. [Mallory] I remember getting all of these phone calls from people who were telling me, "I lost my son's father." It was just so many people with the same story that I realized quickly that, wait a minute, this is a bigger thing. And I just... I got right in. [Voncile] It wasn't long before she started getting it together. [Stanley] She started her activism at the National Action Network. -[man] Happy holidays. -[woman] Thank you. [Mallory] I became Rev. Sharpton's executive assistant. -All right. Happy holidays -to you. -That's right. [man on TV] Tamika Mallory, you are someone who's been out there and an expert on this issue. The guns are coming in our community somehow. We're going into these states and ensuring that people are organized and that they are empowered. Before I come here as an organizer, I come as the mother of a 16-year-old son. So I come here thanking the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan... who is giving me a space to fight for my child. Because justice for him means more to me than anything else in this world. I understand that everyone will not understand the black experience and what it is that we have to go through in order to make up the pieces that have kept us sane with all the shit that we've been through. I get it. I get that for some people it's like, "Why do you need Farrakhan?" But I can tell you that there are a lot of men and women that you can talk to who, if they didn't have him, where the hell would they be? The Nation of Islam was really a stabilizing force for the black community, especially coming out of the crack epidemic. The people who are a part of the Nation of Islam, many of them are people who were not supposed to make it, deemed a statistic, should've been dead, on their way to being dead, locked up for many years. And the Nation of Islam does great work with these people. Now, your next question should be, you know... "But still, there's a lot of hate. It's vile and it hurts." And I say, I agree with you that there are times when Minister Farrakhan says things that makes me very uncomfortable. But I have found a few things about the Nation, over many years, that has been helpful to me and a lot of people in the communities that I serve.

[Andiola speaking] [crowd cheering] [crowd] No dream, no deal. No dream, no deal! [all whooping] [newscaster] The government will run out of money unless Congress can pass a major spending bill. But several members of Congress say they are willing to shut down the government if the young people known as Dreamers are not protected. We are now barreling towards a government shutdown. [newscaster continues speaking] We really urge Democrats to continue to hold that line tonight. They're going into a meeting soon, in the Democratic caucus. Please hold that line. Fight for Dreamers and make sure that you are doing the right thing. You can be the party that does the right thing for Americans. Let the GOP be the party that's trying to hurt children and undocumented youth. [reporter 1] Democrats tried, but failed to link a Dreamer solution to a budget agreement. [reporter 2] "Schumer sells out the resistance," said one, while another argued, "Immigrants in America deserve a Democratic party with backbone." [indistinct chatter] [Andiola speaking Spanish] [laughter] [in English] I have a lot of hope because of that. [all singing in Spanish] ♪ Listen, my people, we bring strength♪ ♪ Liberty is the only flag...♪ [inaudible] People are speaking of me right now, and Linda also, as if we are just these hateful people, and it's just not true. I mean, I can tell you that when I got your message this last week, it was... it was incredibly meaningful. I mean, I think that it's just time -for the conversation to be, like, more direct. -Mmm-hmm. Rather than, like, all of us talking about one another. Hi. -Hi. -[Cotler] This is Tamika. This is the largest synagogue in Brooklyn. Ton of social justice stuff happens in this space. This is what I've heard. This is what I've heard. It's an amazing place, you know, and if you think about it, this is the largest synagogue in Brooklyn and they chose to hire a lesbian rabbi as their senior rabbi. -It says something about them, right? -Yes, it does. So, come on into my office. I appreciate you for allowing me to come. [Timoner] I'm so glad to be able to be in conversation with you. You know, as I mentioned, this... I am, and this congregation... is all about working for a more just world. And to see ourselves in partnership with all oppressed people. That is our mission. Really, Torah's mission. That's what we're about. And so when we filled three buses to go to the Women's March, -we felt like we were in it with you. -[Mallory] Mmm. -We were together with a shared vision. -Yes, we were. And then, when... when Louis Farrakhan says things like... "Jews are satanic. Jews are termites. Jews have tentacles that they wrap around the government of this country. Jews are part of a dark conspiracy to control the media." That's Nazi-style language. But when someone who we think we're in it with, and we want to stand with and march with and be with, doesn't denounce it... First of all, I want... I'm sure other people have told you, but I want to tell you how much that hurts... to feel like, "Wait. We thought we were in it together, but maybe you don't actually care about me, or maybe I don't even count. Maybe you don't see me as human. Or maybe you think I am the enemy in the way that he's saying, that I'm the enemy and that I'm evil." So, that's just really painful. And it seems like you would, as someone who cares about all human beings, directly, clearly, loudly, unequivocally denounce that language. And say, "That is not who we are. That is not who the black community is. That is not where we're going. That's not what we stand for." And so help me understand how... How? Why you wouldn't just clearly, obviously say, "No." Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. So, I think there's a lot of things. And as you said, it hurts, right? To feel that you're in it with someone, and then this other person is saying these things, and then this person is not saying what I want you to say to make it clear that you don't stand with or believe and agree with that. And I think just in that little thing right there, there's some problematic pieces. There is a thing that happens, that black folks are specifically a group of people... that we're constantly having to deal with this sort of litmus test related to Minister Farrakhan, particularly black leaders. And then being told that we have to denounce. So now, if Tamika Mallory says, "I denounce Minister Farrakhan," I can tell you right now that the people who I am trying to work with, these young men who I'm in prisons working with, who are convicted killers, who now we're asking them don't go back out and kill again, and I'm going to show you another way. As soon as I say that I denounce Minister Farrakhan, those relationships have been burned. That there, in my community, that's a problem. But you couldn't say... Why couldn't you say? And it just seems to me necessary, if you're gonna take on a leadership role that is about people beyond the black community also... -[Mallory] Mmm-hmm. I understand. -...to say, "This language is unacceptable. You are demeaning. You are vilifying. You are dehumanizing people I care about. You need to stop that." Right. So, saying to someone, "You need to stop that," and all of those things, that I think we need to, again, kind of be careful with me now policing Minister Farrakhan, because that's not even... That's not my responsibility. My responsibility, though, is to say, "I don't agree with those things, and I organize in a completely different way." And that's very clear. There's nowhere that you can pull up, in my life, where I've said these things, where I'm living in these ways, where I have not been willing to work with Jewish people or to be in community with LGBT folks or anyone. That's not me. I'm being held responsible, literally, for the words of someone else. Well, that's what happens for leaders. [Mallory] Well, not all leaders. -That's not necessarily true. -I'll tell you, in the Jewish world, I mean, there are certainly Jewish leaders who say racist, terrible things, and what it is to be a leader... What I think it means to be a leader, in the Jewish world, is that, when that happens, I have a responsibility to say, "No, that is not who we are. -That is not what we stand for. No." -Okay. And so, to me, that's because... Otherwise, I'm not being a good ally. So, I have been very clear in saying I do not agree with Minister Farrakhan and his position on a number of issues. I've been very clear in saying that. But I do not think that it is true that the same weight and the same... [stammers] expectation is applied to everyone. It is not true. The clear nature of the color of our skin makes it very different who can say different things, so there's certain language that I am not able to use. It is very violent in nature for me to be saying I denounce anyone, and particularly other black people. That is something that I have to be very, very careful about. Because there's already enough harm that has been done to our communities in general. And I understand that for you it's like, "No, he's just one man standing by himself." But that is not so, because he has been a savior to many people who there was no one there. -No one to save them in the past. -[Timoner] I understand. You're making the case that there is systemic racism and that black people are being treated differently than other people, and I'm with you on that. I see that. I agree with that. And that there's litmus tests. I agree with that. But that can be true... and the words that are coming out of Louis Farrakhan's mouth can be utterly unacceptable and repugnant -and anti-Semitic. -Mmm-hmm. And if we are trying to build a larger movement, where we work together, we are depending on each other... [Mallory] Well, let's talk about that. That's a different kind of thing. I'm not saying from on high, "You better, or else." I'm saying I wanna be in this with you, but right now, we feel, and I... Stosh, you might not agree with me, but many, many Jews feel like... we don't count and are not... It's all of us except for the Jews. -[Mallory] Right. -And so, I wanna be in it. I wanna be in it with you. And I'm saying to you, can we be allies to each other? Not because I have power over you and I'm gonna make you do it, but because you would want to do it. I want you to want to do it because you see something that you think is wrong and you therefore say, "That is wrong." Right. First of all, I don't agree that Jews have been excluded, because no one in the Women's March has done or said any of these things and you've been included. We've worked together. We've been doing this work together. The exclusion that you're talking about is the fact that someone else has said something, that this man has said something, and that the expectation of me is to say exactly the words that you feel I should say in order for you to feel that you're included. But I don't feel like it is fair for people to make me have to speak to one person's words and ideology. I feel like I should be able to say, "This is how I personally feel about my Jewish brothers and sisters." How do you feel about your Jewish brothers and sisters? I feel like my Jewish brothers and sisters are a part of the world that we have to build together. If we're in this together, if we're willing to fight together, I need you. I need you. [Cotler] To me, it doesn't matter if I disagree with your decision to whether you are or are not going to denounce this person. I am very clear that I am committed to being with you and with your community. And I want you to be committed to being with me and my community. When I'm in a room with people who are not Jewish and when they say 53% of American white women voted for Donald Trump, they look at me and they feel like I am one of those women. And if other white Jews are in the room, they're looking and they're including those white Jews in the room. And I want us to understand that white Jews do benefit from white supremacy, 100%. But whiteness for Jews has always been and still is totally conditional. We are both facing a really vicious hatred. And it looks different the way that our communities are targeted, but we are both... The white nationalism that is being fostered in this country right now, it's aiming at both of us. And the NRA, right? They're... We're endangered. We're both... Both of our groups are endangered. And it's different. I'm not saying it's the same. But I think that there is something that we can connect on there. Well, the pain is the same. [Timoner] Yeah, the pain is the same. The pain is the same. The circumstances may be slightly, you know, different, but the pain is the same. Someone had to tell me that in Charlottesville, they were saying, "The Jews will not replace us." I didn't even pick up on that immediately. Someone had to say that to me, and then I was like, "Oh, my God." Because I'm almost so used to it being... so used to anti-blackness, and then when I'm hearing that there's anti-others and hate for others, I'm like, this thing is big. Big. And it's going to take all of us working together to try to fix it. And that's all I can think of. All I can think of is... if you're hurting and I'm hurting, it's almost, like, "Good. Okay. This is great." Can we please find a way to work together, and can you help me, you know, to do what I'm so passionate about doing? Which is to try to lift people from the bottom up? But this has to start the process, so our children don't end up here. You know what I'm saying? I think that us understanding each other better and listening to each other and finding our way to be able to be sisters and be in this together is just good. I do hope this is just the beginning for us. -You can't get rid me. -[Timoner laughs] I'll be back for sure.

It's a political claiming of power that rose out of the Women's March. Marching became running for office. Massachusetts is ready to send its first black Democrat to Congress. [reporter 1] A surprise to virtually everyone, including the candidate herself. [Ayanna Pressley] I didn't come here to deliver a victory speech. When we realize justice and equality for everyone, then, and only then, will I deliver a victory speech. [reporter 2] For the first time ever, Native American women will be represented in Congress. Representation is important. I think diversity is important. Every voice deserves a seat at the table. [crowd cheering] [reporter] 2018 also saw the first Muslim women elected to serve in the House. What message do you hope that your victory sends this morning to the country, other than that you're a bad mama jama? [Ilhan Omar] Minnesota is a cold state, but the people have warm hearts. And we don't just welcome immigrants, but we send them to Washington. [reporter 3] Lucy McBath, she'll be the first Democrat since 1979 to represent Georgia's sixth district. [man] She's dedicated her activism to ending gun violence since her son's death. I am tired of politicians who put profit over public safety while our children and our families continue to suffer. The youngest congresswoman in history, please welcome Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We've got a clip of the moment you found out you won. [exclaiming] She's looking at herself on television right now. How are you feeling? -Can you put it into words? -Nope. [woman] It's not just electing women candidates. It's electing candidates who are advocates for a more inclusive view of the country. When I travel to Washington, I will take your voices and your values with me. I am your representative. I work for you and I cannot wait to get started. -[cheers and applause] -Thank you.
