Hello, information? I'd like some information,please. How can you know whether or not you're dreaming? Pinch him, pinch him... Show him that life is just a game. Are you ever certain... that it ends with the night? How can you know... when it's really over? When I don't know what game I'm playing pinch my cheek, pinch my arm, pinch my ear So I'll wake up and see that everything's the same... whether we're asleep or awake. Pinch me, pinch me, pinch me Show me.. let's show him... ...that I'm not dreaming... ...that he fell asleep... Pinch, pinch...or don't pinch. The only time we don't dream... is when we're dreaming. Should we steal Clipman's doodads? Hurry up. Careful. Where were you, Gaudinier? Martin, hurry up. You think that's funny? - You too cool for us? It's the third time. - But it's the first in red. Titanic on the portside! Gaudinier to the principal's office. No! It wasn't him! So who was it? No fair! You always blame him! Especially 'cause when he gets in trouble, his mother cries. I swear. You have to understand: he's all she's got. And we all know how nice you are, sir. Gaudinier, I'm too nice. Give me a clean floor and I'll give you a clean slate. Get to it! What's wrong with you today? - Nothing. You sure? Just Gaudinier. Everyone else, get to work! I won't punish you if you work seriously and quietly.. for once! Martin... ...are you feeling better this morning? Police! Hands up! So how are you feeling today? Great. I'm all laughs. Happy now? He seems better today. - You're smart for a girl. No one cares about the common good. Everyone looks after his own interests. Gaudinier, what do you think of that? Gaudinier, I'm talking to you. -Uh...I don't know, sir. OK. I'll make it easier. The division of Verdun, how about that? I didn't say that I don't understand. I said that I don't know. Don't be rude! Me, rude? If you prefer, I could say that I know very well. That you know what? -That I don't know. But that wouldn't give you the answer. OK, Gaudinier. Go to the principal's office with a pink slip. I've heard that one before. -Wait, sir, Martin's sick. It's not his fault. He has a fever. It comes and goes. Cut the crap. -I'm trying to help. I'm sick of your bullshit. Do the two of you mind? Martin! Bertier? -It's his third pink slip. Back to your seat. One of you is enough. Martin! He didn't go to the principal's office. Where the hell is he? -I looked in the infirmary. He's not in the library either. -Mind your own business! But I want to help. -We don't need you help. Martin's not in the attic. He knew that a third pink slip meant suspension. Now he must be afraid of his mom. She never yells at him. -Yeah, but... I'm in a rush 'cause if I'm 10 minutes late, Steps sends out an APB. You give in too easily. If you don't spoil them with good behavior... I told you. No one's home. His mother's always at work. Should we ring the bell? Leave a message? -Saying what? Go easy on him. It's not his fault if he's a fool. What if he ran away? That way we wouldn't have any explaining to do. His house sure is nothing to write home about. Jerome, come look! Is that his mother in the bed? -I think so. She looks sick. We have to call a doctor. What about your father? No way. Anyway, Martin must have already taken care of it. What are you doing there? Police! We were looking for you. You could have rang the bell. -I did. I'm sick of your crap. Get lost! What the hell? -Get lost! What's wrong with your mother? Maybe Antoine's father can help. He's a doctor. Come in. I think she's dead. Are you serious? Because that's no laughing matter. First we have to check. You got a mirror? She's dead, all right. Time of death? It happened so suddenly It's coronary thrombroken. What's that? A piece of the heart breaks off and clogs the blood. It's very serious. Let's call the doctor. For a dead person? Let's go. It happened two days ago. She looked tired when she got back from work. I thought she was sleeping. When I brought her dinner in bed... she wasn't moving. I didn't know what to do. I had no one to talk to. And us? What are friends for? -You'll keep it a secret? Did you call the police? No, the hospital. That's the usual procedure. First an autopsy... -There's no need for that. And what about the interment certificate? What's that? -Something very important. What about me? Do I go to the poorhouse? No, the DCS. -What? They're in charge of abandoned kids. They run the orphanages. I saw a lot of disgusting TV shows about them. I'll pass on that. I'll say! You know what I saw on TV? Stop! The TV's bullshit. My dad told me so. It's too late for the cops. They'll yell at you 'cause you didn't call them sooner. We can say that she just died. You're crazy. They can determine the exact second of the murder. This isn't a murder! I have to call Steps. Anyway, you can't leave her like that. What would you do? -Bury her. Hi. It's me. I'm working at Martin's and I'm staying for dinner. No, I can't put his mom on. She's outside. Yeah, bye. Stepmothers...what a pain in the ass! At least mine is. Shit, she could trust me a little. We'd have to come at night,... ...but I don't know if it's a very good idea. I think we should get out of here. And I don't know what we'll find when we dig. All those dead people. The diggers must know how to go around the coffins. You think dead people are stacked on top of each other? Of course. How else could it be? And we'll have to do something at the church too. Thank God it's empty sometimes. She didn't believe in God. That's no reason. There are lots of people who... Listen, if God exists, he'll understand that it's not easy for us. And if he doesn't exist, it's no big deal. These gardens are nice and big. Everyone in the building has one except my dad 'cause he thinks they're stupid. Imagine the face of the man who digs up your mother... ...while he's planting his tomatoes. Cities suck. Everything's too close together. It's nice here, really nice. And it's not far so we can always come see her. She'll like that. How can you know what a dead person will like? It's great here. Too bad Antoine couldn't stay. Maybe you should sleep at my house tonight. We could figure out a way. -No, I can't leave her alone. Marianne... ...can I ask you something? -Let me go. Are you an orphan? -It's none of your damned business. I just want to know. Did they put you in an orphanage? I just want to know how you found your new parents. In a box of Crackerjacks. Just tell me. All I want is some information. It's great to be an orphan. You can always get new parents. OK? Look. -Wow! If my father knew I took all this stuff... I already got bawled out last night. How are you today? OK. Look. Bodies rot underground. That's gross. So why do they bury them in the first place? Because it's worse above ground. We have to hurry up. Yeah, that's why some people prefer to stay home in an urn. I know. It's called incineration. Should we burn her? Are you crazy? The whole town would see the smoke. A coffin is better. It's more discreet. Yeah, but how can we find one? So you think you're on vacation? Gaudinier... ...I wrote to your mother about your three day suspension. I asked her to come see me. We have to put an end to this attitude problem. Get going. ...a dry seed and a seed soaked in water... ...to see it better under the microscope. "NEED A WOODEN CRATE ABOUT SIX FEET LONG" Take the dry seed and look at it closely. It's hard because it contains very little water... ...so it should resist the frost. Now take the seed soaked in water. You can see a thick skin. Later, we'll remove it with the scalpel. Under this skin you can see the two cotyledons. "WE PAY CASH" After you separate them, you'll find an embryo. This is what we'll look at under the microscope. So take the plant, the seed,... ...your scalpels and start to take off the outer skin,... ...the first layer, and... May I please go to the bathroom? -Yes, you may. So, take your scalpel... Be careful. Her mother's a social worker. So what? Not everyone spills the beans to mommy and daddy. How much? -It depends on your crate. It's a grandfather clock. It doesn't work anymore. Can we see it? It's important. You want to skip lunch? How tall is it? About six feet. As long as it's bigger than 5'4". There's even a porthole. Yeah, but the view won't be terrific. It's fine with me. How much do we owe you? -That depends on why you need it. Should we tell her? Yeah, I think we can. -Me too. Can you keep a secret? Do you swear? On my mother's life. Now I'm scared. -Don't worry. Anyway, for what it's worth, the clock's on me. That's nice of you. Shit, hurry up. I've been hanging around for an hour. If I catch pneumonia, it'll be your fault. Sorry but they wouldn't go to bed. How did you manage? When Dallas is on, Steps isn't tired. At 9 when I said "Night, folks" you should have seen their faces. Did you put the pillow under the sheets? Come in. -Is everything OK? Don't be afraid. It's my brother, Oliver. He's with us. He knows? -I swore I'd say nothing. We can't manage without him. How old are you? -16. Lucky stiff. I'm Jerome. Why are you helping us? I'm happy Claire's growing up. Don't start. Are we going or not? Remember that they're coming back at 12. Your brother's great. If I had one like that, Steps would shut her face. What's it like having a social worker for a mother? Is she cool? I don't know. Did you see her? Who? Martin's mother. Since she died. -Of course. What's it like? -Nothing special. You never saw a dead person? -No. It's heavy. Do you believe in life after death? No. After, there's nothing. That's impossible. When it's over, there has to be something else. What does "nothing" mean? One thing's for sure, we'll never finish if we start off like this. Where's Martin? Is he sleeping? -Should we wake him up? No, no, let's go. What should we do? Hey, where are you going? You were sleeping, so... -No, I was just thinking. We brought the clock, I mean the... Good. Can I go see? -See what? She never saw a dead person. I don't know. It might be a shock for a girl. I want to see her. -No, wait, Claire. What's she doing? We should go in. Let's take the clock in. It's a good excuse. You should pick out a nice dress for her. I was going to. This one's not bad. -No. This one's better. I can keep the other one for when I want to think of her. It's funny, before I didn't tell her anything... ...and now I always have things to say. It'll be hard to put it on a... corpse. It's not a corpse. It's my mother! Don't touch her. Do you want us to help you or not? -Yes...no. I can't undress her in front of you. Claire, can you help me? I don't know if I'll be able to. Of course you can. The two of us will manage. I'll call you when it's time to put her in the clock. I hope he won't take forever 'cause I have to get home. Do you think we're making a mistake? What else can we do? I didn't tell him everything I heard about orphanages. Like what? Marianne wouldn't tell me a thing. Just the other day, they showed one where they beat the kids. One of them had to go to the hospital. But that couldn't happen too often. Yeah, well I can tell you that I never saw a nice one on TV. In the United States there are great ones. Yeah, right. How do you know? -Everyone knows. Mom. What's got into you? -Nothing. Bye. What are you doing? Get lost. A corpse is damned heavy. And it's cold. Aren't you scared? -Of what? Did a dead person ever bawl you out or slap you? It's just the living. Anyway, I... -Give me a hand. Why did you tell him? We need muscles. -What if he screws up? He's OK. Too many of us are going to be missing from the cafeteria. No one's forcing you. What do you want from us? -I have the right to take a walk. What should we do? Tell her? -No way. Why not? Her of all people. -She's the kind to blab all over. Just to show off in front of the boys. -What do you mean? She goes out with eighth-graders. Lots of them. Even my brother. -Olivier? Among others. I think she'll understand. I don't care about your baby secrets. Go away! Anyway, I'm not going to leave. Does everyone agree? No one says anything to anyone. Swear it. I swear. -I swear. I swear. I swear. I swear too. This is all I did in two hours. You're lucky to be suspended. Haudry's class was the pits. I can't dig anymore by myself. That's why we're here. Julien, take the shovel from him. We're doing all we can so that he feels good, and you cry. I know, but I can't help it. -So leave. Sorry, but it makes me cry. -I noticed. It's because I like you a lot. Do you need anything? I'm an orphan too. Well I'm not. I just don't know who my father is. Marianne, come look. Leave her alone. I don't care if she cries. You don't care? No, that's not what I meant. Can't you control yourself? -But it's really sad. Lots of things are sad but you don't have to cry for all of them! Maybe I do. Can't you think about him a little? -I am. That's why I'm crying. If you can't cry for a dead person, what can you cry for? Stop, stop! Stop screaming at each other, please. How's he going to... I mean now that... Keep a lid on it, Julien. How am I going to do what? I don't know...food and everything, if you're all alone. We'll help him. We'll get by. Wait. I was thinking that maybe some parents are better than others. They could help us because they're more used to... We keep our lips sealed. OK? -OK. It wouldn't work with my parents but there are some you can trust. Are we going to dig? -We'll never finish. I'll get it done. It'll take all day. Maybe I could ask my brother to help us. And to get more shovels. But if we cut classes again they'll notice. And that's exactly what we don't... You're such a schmuck! Is there anything inside your head? Look. Do you really need slide? Get close to the photo. Look at the apses, the entrance to the cathedral. We're going to look at each item on he list at the top of the photo. It's beautiful. Each stone is a painting. We could spend hours discussing all the aspects of cathedrals... ...their construction, their importance to the country. Let's begin with number 1... M. Gibert is one of your teachers, isn't he? I'm his neighbor... His house is on fire. Excuse me. Yes, yes. You'll all go to study hall, quietly and calmly... ...I have an emergency. Is it serious, sir? -I hope not. No, it's not serious, it's not serious. Teacher's pet! Nerd! Quiet, quiet, keep quiet. Leave the shovels here. The hole is great. There's lots of extra room. If Steps isn't busy... That's not funny. And there's a problem. When mom's inside... ...we can't lift up the clock. -If we work as a team... We've closed it for the time being. You'll see tonight, we lined the inside with tin foil. It's really pretty. It'll be great with the candles. Why tin foil? Because it protects. Antoine said that's how Steps keeps food fresh. And I always promised her that I'd give her jewelry for Mother's Day. And now I sort of kept my promise 'cause it's all silvery inside. Let's go. We'll never make it two miles to the woods. What are we going to do? I said it was too heavy. Listen, this is a good start. Now we're all set for tonight. We need a cart. -I have a wheelbarrow. Too small. -Not if she's sideways. I'm counting on you to be reasonable and to go to bed early. My mother's very strict so... -Very good. I understand. Thank your mother for inviting Claire. I'll call her a little later. No, I'm not a baby. And my sister's always hogging the phone. Oh, you have a sister? -A half-sister, mom. Oh, I understand. OK, get going. Did you take your toothbrush? Wait here. I'll go in the back door. Hello ma'am. I've come to pick up Marianne. Hello. I hope she's ready. Marianne! Are you eating at your house tonight? -Yes, ma'am. It seems tough, but if you try hard enough,... ...you can get your parents to do anything. Here, look what I've got. Peas, pot roast, candy. It's all I could get. OK? There was nothing at my house. Go see her. You look at her for a minute and think about her. Then you come eat. If there's anything you want to know, just ask. Eat! she doesn't look dead. I think so! Do we have to stay much longer? No, go eat. Make some room. I'm not too hungry. -Eat. It's the funerary feast. What's that? -It's to celebrate the dead. You know how adults jump at the chance to party. In any case, my mother's happy when I eat, so... Wine? -Are you nuts? It's great stuff. Too bad I couldn't find any whisky. It must be Pierrot. I told Mozart to come for the music. He knows? Yes. I swore I'd say nothing. But I only know dance music. It's the same thing only slower. Martin, do you have pieces of black cloth? In the movies, the ladies wear veils. It's not worth it. -But... Stop meddling! -Don't fight! OK, it's time. The three volunteers come with me. This car is my father's but there's another. There. It's Steps' but she hardly uses it anymore. Does it still work? Push. I'll open the door. Go ahead, push. -It doesn't work. Try taking off the hand-brake. Now push. Move. I'm starting it up. You're sure you know how? If we wake Steps, we'll be in deep shit. I know cars like the back of my hand. Move away, don't stay there. Be careful. -Just watch this. I think we should just forget about it. What if we pushed it to Martin"s? The engine's so old, it would probably be faster What were you all saying? Shit, it works! -Come on, get in. Amazing! Look what we've brought home. You'll have to back it in. Careful. She's going to fall. Not if we drive slowly. We've just got to hold her. Be careful. How should we do it? Moving men have ropes that they put underneath. We don't have any rope. -We'll manage. Watch out. Let go. OK, I think we can start. What do we do now? Whatever you want. What's it like usually? I...we stood there and everyone came up to us... ...and shook hands and everything. You should stand there. This is stupid. -Any other suggestions? I liked her a lot. You didn't even know her! I'm guessing. I'm saying it for Martin's sake. What do we do now? Usually we just leave. But we just started! I knew she was wrong. That's what I saw. What about the flowers? And don't we have to fill the hole? Do we have to do it all tonight? I don't care how it's supposed to be. It's my mother and I'll decide. Let's start all over. First there's a speech. -He's right. What speech? Say why she was a great mother. -I didn't prepare anything. OK, listen, we can do the moment of silence. That way you'll have time to think. We'll keep quiet for one minute. Is it a minute yet? -Shut up! Go ahead. It's your turn. I'm not too good at speaking. Mom said it was her fault,... ...'cause she didn't have enough time to take care of me. Uh...my mother was a cleaning lady... ...and it's not fair 'cause she preferred to stay home... I had a father. I don't know his name or who he is. Mom didn't want to tell me and now I'll never know. It would have been better if she told me, maybe he could have... Mom, now I'm going to do everything right... ...maybe that'll make you come back. I don't think so, but maybe... What should we say now? Whatever you want. What she was like. She was nice... ...tall with brown hair. With a loud voice, but soft at the same time. It's hard to describe her... she smelled really good... ...even though her hands were all rough from her job. I don't want to cover her with earth, because...just maybe... It's impossible. Don't worry. We'll take care of everything. We'll put the flowers...hey, Marianne,... ...Pierrot, Claire. But the flowers go after. -No more advice! That's how we fill the hole? -No, let me, I should do it. No. -Let me. I can't. How's he going to get by? -He's got us. Yea, but there are things that adults... -We won't let you down. We'll take real good care of you. We forgot the music. Hey, Martin's not here. -I've looked everywhere. Mozart, did you see Martin? -No. It's normal. He's suspended. He has one day to go. He should be home. I said we shouldn't have left him alone. Shit! -Jerome! I was at the hole. I mean the grave. -Why? I wanted to put some flowers. Alone? -Wait! Martin's there. What's he doing? -I don't know. Hey, where are you going? -I forgot my math book. We forgot we had math today. Did he spend the night here? -He wanted to stat next to his mother. I think he was scared. I would have been too. I told you so. -But... Just don't listen to him. We're not going to make it. -Yes we will. We're too young! -So stay a Step-baby! What are you doing here? Are you OK? -Yeah. How come you're not at school? We're on our way. You slept here? You were scared at your house? What an ass. I was hanging around and I was tired so... Get going. You're going to be late. Can we leave you alone? -It's great to be suspended three days. It should last all week long. Get going! You're not cold? -No, I'm OK. When my parents died, I was cold all the time. Mom, I'm going to work at Marianne's. All this stuff must have been expensive. Shit, it's burnt. It's not my fault. Usually I just watch. You see, I told you. You have to cook meat with oil. No, dipshit! It's potatoes that you cook with water. Listen to this! Heat the butter and brown the lamb. Put it in the pan with chunks of fat... If Steps finds out that I stole her cookbook... Don't worry, you'll eat soon. OK. I'll help them. What can I do? No, no... -Get out of the kitchen. OK, but I didn't do it on purpose. Here's the cake. How is it? -Wait for the spaghetti! How long does it take to cook? Taste it anyway. I don't know if it's good. It couldn't be too bad. At least we can say that all this has taught us how to cook. You'll see. In three days it'll be delicious! And we're having fun. I decided to quit school. Are you crazy? Give me a good reason besides making my mother happy. You promised her! And if you quit now, they'll notice. I don't care! That's how you end up in an orphanage As soon as a kid is alone, they pop up. They're short of kids, so whenever they can get their hands on one... I have to bring back my pink slip signed And I can't forge my mother's signature. Can I see it? Do you have an example of it? Forget it. We'll never be able to. -Let me try. Not bad. OK, Marianne, you'll do it every time. Soon they won't see the difference. You see, whenever there's a problem, we find a solution. What's going on? -Mind your own business. Get lost! We're gonna get nabbed. -The schoolyard's for everyone. Get lost! Get lost! So? He wants to see his mother. Shit! What did he answer? What we rehearsed. She's busy, but he got a whipping. The principal was thrilled. What do you expect? Sadism goes with the job. He was a kid once too. He has no memory. Amnesia goes with the job too. All the same, it worked. -Here's Martin. So, what happened? It was great. He believed it all, the letter, everything. You see, we can outsmart them. Give them a pill and they'll swallow it. So, a punished student is a hero? No, sir, that's not why. Write me three pages entitled Why Killers Become Heroes. I'll grade it myself. Are you happy now? Same for Gaudinier who doesn't seem too affected... ..by his mother's disciplinary measures. No, not him, sir. He didn't anything. -You too. OK, any other volunteers? Is there a Gaudinier in your class? -Who? Gaudinier? -Martin? Yes, why? What's he like? He's nice. Very nice. What did he do? Oh, you like him a lot. I understand. He's..he's just a friend. I have to go see his mother. Oh, no! He always gets yelled at. And he lives alone with her... Don't worry, honey. She hasn't answered the principal's letters... ...so it's my duty to go talk to her. When are you going? -I'm on my way now. I'll come along. I'll show you where it is. I have to ask him something. Listen, I shouldn't let you... My math book. Wait for me Stop playing. Get out of here! Go! Marianne? Get to Martin's fast. My mother's on her way to see his mother Think of something. I'll try to stall her as long as I can. Wait. Are you doing this on purpose? Here it is. Martin Gaudinier? -Yes. Hello. I'm Claire's mom. She has something to ask you. Me too, in fact. I'm a social worker. I work for the school... ...and I'd like to meet your mother. I'm sorry, ma'am but she's not home. When might I be able to see her? It's tough because she works a lot. Even I don't get to see her too often. -Here, give her this letter... ...and tell her to call me or the principal. Sure, ma'am. Is everything OK, Martin? Do you need anything? N, no. Thank you, ma'am. Good-bye. -Good-bye. You didn't ask him about your math. It wasn't worth it. I don't like your job. But why? It's my job to help people. -You scare them. Just like the cops. What on earth are you talking about? -You wouldn't understand. I don't see how I might have scared Martin. He didn't seem too afraid. Anyway, everyone is ganging up on him. Maybe that's why the principal wants to see his mom. It's not her fault if she's poor. No father? -No. So she needs to work a lot. I understand. So I'll try to see her at her home. No, it's worse. Try to understand. He'll think everyone's angry at him. What should I do with this letter? -Garbage can! No, wait! Stop! Are you stupid or what? They'll think something's wrong... ...then they'll come poking around. What'll we do then? That's what I was trying to say. Martin, get some stationary. Marianne, your pen. If it's a letter they want... Watch your spelling. My mother made a ton of mistakes. Yeah, but we have to be unbeatable. We'll check everything in the dic. Write: Dear Sir, I am sorry I couldn't come to see you... ...but my work keeps me very busy. Wait! Wait! I would like, however, to come this Friday... Are you crazy? -Relax ...at 4 o'clock. Next, we'll see how animals live at a slower pace... ...and how they make the transition from a slow pace to a normal one. Keep quiet. A bomb threat, surely just a bad joke. Children, in utter silence you will leave the class... ...and follow your teacher. Line up and don't panic. Follow me. Don't take your things. Bomb! Don't scream Madame Haudry, keep your class in order. Children, please. Keep moving. Tell the principal that your mother came but that with the panic... ...she wasn't able to see him. And with her job... How did you pull this one off? It's great. Claire! But...hurry up! What's the risk? Come here. In the movies, when it's dangerous, they kiss. But you told me there was no danger? Have you kissed girls before? Yeah. I'm physically attracted to you but it's not you that I love. Who is it? -I can't tell you. Does he know? -Are you crazy? Is it a friend? -I'm not going to say. Antoine? -How do you know? Anyway, he'll never want me. You won't tell him. -Cross my heart. And it's Martin that I should... He's the one that needs affection. He's got Marianne. -She's a slut. Does she go out often? What are those two doing here? So did you tell him? Sir, did you see my mother? -What for? It's great! It must be expensive. -I'll say! Now you can't get anymore bad grades or pink slips. Because I won't know what to do if they start looking for your mom again. It's going to be tough. Piece of cake. I'll help you in English... ...Claire in Math, Antoine in French, Dede in Science. You'll be unbeatable. If we work as a team... ...we'll manage to get off their shitlist. How do you patch a pair of pants? My mother takes the two ends, puts them on top of the other... ...then she sews them like that. It's a shame the girls couldn't come. They're right... ...we have to be careful or else our parents will get suspicious. And you know, girls don't know how to do anything anymore. You saw when we were cooking. It's worse for sewing. Do you think you should tell a girl when you love her? I don't know. Who are you thinking of? Marianne? Claire? I'd like to know if she likes me. I don't think she even knows what it means. She doesn't love anyone. Look at the time. We should hurry up. Shit, the neighbor. Hide! Hello, Martin. Is your mother in? I doubt it or else you wouldn't be blasting the music. Sorry, sir. She's working. Good for her. I mean she's lucky. Because as far as my job hunt is going.. Tell me, do you need anything? No, no. Everything's fine. OK I'll come back sometime when she's home. It's the third time he's come. -Does he suspect something? Were your mom and him together? Are you kidding? Think about it. They don't tell us every time they do it. Your mother hasn't given up men since you were born! I think so. Don't be naive! They have to do it just for the hygiene. Stop! Besides, he's married. Big deal. Take my mom for example... I hope he's right. All we need now is a jealous lover. OK, I'm off to Steps. Sure you don't want to sleep at my place? You can go in by the balcony. No one will know. I want to stay here. Marianne. Marianne, I know you're there. How did you know? Thanks for the flowers. My parents grave is far away, so... I never would have thought that we could become friends. I wanted to but i was afraid to say so. It sucks that we can never pick our friends. The ones I have aren't the ones I... I never say anything because I'm happy to have them. I didn't know you were like that. -What time is it? We have to go. Did you learn your history? -No. Come on. Martin Gaudinier to the blackboard. Look at his pants! You see, you laugh at my bike clips. I could call you 'Patches'. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sure. No fair! In a public school you can't... ...tease someone 'cause he's poor. I'm not teasing. It's not his fault if his mother can't buy him nice clothes. Enough. I didn't say anything disagreeable to your friend. Let's get on with the drill. You'll probably flunk him for this. What's going on here? We know you don't like Gaudinier. I like Gaudinier very much and I've noticed that he's been trying harder. Go back to your seat and we'll continue. Bingo. ADULTS...WHEN YOU BAWL THEM OUT, THEY'RE WORSE THAN... Very well, let's leave Hughues Capet and the year 1000... ...and move on to Philippe Auguste. Helene, you will read. Bertier, give me that paper. what paper, sir? Martin! Martin! And because I have to do well in school, I started working hard. What's funny is that everyone is doing better. And the teachers don't understand why. We found other articles about orphanages and I swear that it's not for me. If you had told me my father's name, I could have tried to find him. I looked through your stuff, even though I know you don't like that. I found a photo. I don't know if it's him with you. But you were really pretty. I hope there was nothing between you and Mr. Campola because he stops by almost every day. Gaudinier, I have to ask you something. Is your mother sick? What's wrong, do I smell or something? -Leave him alone. I want to know if his mother's sick. -It's none of your business. My father wants to know. I couldn't care less. But she hasn't come to work, so... That's where his mother was a cleaning lady. It's disgusting to hire the mother of someone you know as a maid. She found a better job. Why better? You think it's fun cleaning houses? I never thought... Are you proud that your parents use a woman just 'cause she's poor? Don't worry. It's not your fault if your parents are like that. OK, but what am I going to tell my father? What did he do? -Butt out! Should we tell him? Nicolas, we'll tell you everything if you swear... Do you believe in God? I cross my heart not to say anything. OK? OK, we'll tell you everything. Martin, I never see you alone. It's normal. They all take care of me. Come here. Martin. What's wrong? You can kiss me if you want. Here? But you don't believe in God. I thought you were already going out with someone. But I'll stop if you want. Really? Did you forget to question Gaudinier again? No. His mother doesn't want to come anymore. I guess it was too difficult for her to let us know. I heard that you're not the greatest people to work for, It's Martin that said so! He must be his mother's pride and joy: the class dunce! This term, he's doing great. -Don't talk back. Is it like stealing if you don't declare your cleaning lady? Now I've heard it all! You'd be better off worrying about your grades. When a kid's parents have an accident, who's in charge? Of who? You're a barrel of laughs tonight. Of the kid. If the parents die, for example. Nicolas, do you want something bad to happen to us? No, I'm just asking. Is this for school? Uh, yeah...we're doing a survey. Well, he goes to his next of kin. His grandparents. And if he doesn't have any? With an uncle or cousins. And if he has no family? -I've had enough of this! Don't lose your temper. Then he goes to an orphanage. Is that good? -Well, it's better than nothing. Hi. -Hi. I managed to make something edible. Are you hungry? No, I can only stay half an hour. For once you're all alone. Everyone's busy. I was going to do my homework. I don't even watch TV anymore. I broke up with Xavier. I didn't ask you to. You're not jealous? -No. You're weird sometimes. Hide! Hello, Martin. Is your mother in? -No, sir. I think she is. I have to see her. It's impossible. It's very important for me. You're married! Tell her that I look for her every day.. ...that I don't know how she's avoided me... That I can't live without her. That I can't stop thinking of the time we spent together. You'll remember all this? She doesn't want to see you anymore. -What did you say? She said you should stop coming. When? I want her to tell me herself. She told me to tell you to stop thinking she loves you... ...and to leave her alone because she loves just her son. But that's impossible. I know that she loves you. I do too. She even said that if you didn't listen, she'd go see your wife. She couldn't have said that. More than once. And she's not here! Well done. I don't think you'll see him again. You know some men will say anything to get what they want. I didn't know about them. If it's his fault that she got her throm broken... Her what? -Her throm. What's that? She broke something? -It's part of the heart. If her heart was broken, there has to be a reason,huh? People don't die from love. At least not in real life. How could you know what my mother was like? You didn't even know her. Calm down. The proof is that she didn't even tell me about this guy. She couldn't. You know, a woman... Leave me alone, you too! It must be worth a lot. He won't go higher than 4000. What a sleazeball! We shouldn't give in. Adults! They make money by using us. Why discuss? Let's mug him. We should tell the police. So they'll start wondering about Martin? With Nicolas' money, we're at 2750. But with electricity, phone, rent and lunch money, we need almost 5000. They mail everything together. You don't have time to breathe. If we accept, we still have 1750. Maybe we could bring other stuff later, So what are we going to do? Accept? Go without me. I'll wait here. Is something wrong? No, no. It's nothing. I liked that chest. Excuse me. 16 out of 20! Very good, Claire. Nicolas Bosserat, 14. Jerome Callier, 15. Very good, Jerome. And they think it's thanks to them. Antoine Bertier, 17. Very good. And finally, anything's possible. Martin Gaudinier, 18. Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray for Martin! Hey, Martin! Gaudinier! Move away, move away! What happened? -I don't know. We have to take him to the hospital. Sir, it's Gaudinier. You have to tell his parents. -No, no! Because his mother worries about every little thing. And we're his friends, so we can tell her. No, no. Move away...go on. How do you feel, Martin? I think it's his ankle. -Move away... ...don't stand there. Martin, what happened? It's nothing, nothing at all. -Are you OK? You stay here. -Chin up. What does Clipman want now? Madame. This afternoon your son had an accident. Fortunately, it was not too serious. His ankle is being put in a cast; he will come home tonight. I am his history teacher, and I have wanted to meet you... ...for quite some time. Please call me at 43... The nerve of him! I think that's nice. -Nice? We're trapped! He's clueless! -So what? Don't fight. -I agree. I don't care. It's a nurse. If she thinks he's alone, she's going to wait. If she sees us, it's even worse. -It depends on what we tell her. Lean against me. You see, no one's home. I'll wait for my mother. But don't stay. She could come back late. I intend to stay. Do you have a phone? You see? We have to do something. Just go up to her. Why me? You look serious. You had us scared for a while. Are you OK? I'm his older brother. You didn't tell me you had a brother. He always forgets about me. Mom said she'd be home soon and that I should watch him till then. I intend to wait too. Ma'am, she'll yell at us. Why? You think I can leave you alone? Of course, with my brother. Mom said that you could leave. Are you sure I can leave you? Of course. Then I'll be going. You're a very brave boy. See you soon. Get some rest. Good-bye. That was hairy! It's like Alfred Hitchcock. Something always pops up. Does it hurt? Come sit down. It's a sprain. Not a break. But I have to mail the doctor my mother's insurance number. And I don't even know where it is. Or even what it looks like. We'll look around. I can always ask my mother to lend me hers. Or I can steal it. Don't worry, we're unbeatable. We're in deep shit. Clipman is asking everyone about Martin's mother. Sir, what do you have against Martin now? He didn't do anything. Relax. I'm just asking some questions about his mother. What about her? She's great. You'll never know how great she is! Yeah, I believe you. When did you see her last? Yesterday..uh, not too long ago... two days ago. OK, but I started wondering... ...maybe your friend needs us, maybe he's very unhappy. Maybe his mother left with a man and Martin's alone and afraid. Not her, sir, she's not the type. You haven't found Martin strange lately? Anything but strange. Careful, here he comes. Forget about this and be nice to him. You never know. Why do you go to his house every morning? It's none of your business. He's my friend. I'll do whatever I want. Same for him. He needs a buddy, not a body. Excuse me. Martin Gaudinier to the principal's office. Stop! Missed again, Titanic. Does anyone have the courage to tell me why I'm called 'Titanic'? Sink or swim! If I'm sinking instead of singing, it's thanks to retards like you... ...23 years as captain of the Ship of fools. So, either you sing seriously... ...or I'll give you a test you'll never forget. Who doesn't want to sing? 1, 2, 3... No, no, stay in your seats. I sent for Gaudinier. Where is he? He left for your office, sir. Are you sure? Your classmate is possibly having some problems... ...which he would prefer to keep secret. So try to be nice to him. I just hope he doesn't disappear. He's not at the grave. -I told you so. Where would I hide if I were Martin? In the school attic? No, I have the keys. -What if we don't find him? Is this his mother? You don't even know? At your house you don't even look at the maid? Don't start again! I didn't pick my parents! OK, I have to go, 'cause Steps is back and better than ever. Hey, Martin! We've been looking for you for 2 hours. Didn't you hear us? I was afraid you weren't alone. I forged another letter explaining that your mother is on a trip. I could get a friend to mail it from Paris. It won't work. In three days, everything will start over again. We don't have much of a choice. You hide or you run. For how long? -I don't know but they can't find you. Where am I going to sleep? I can't stay outside all the time. I knew today would suck. Last night I dreamt that my mother wasn't dead That we buried her alive and she couldn't dig her way out. I saw that on the late show. -I'm sick of your damned movies! I woke up and ran there. I even dug a little. It's dumb. But why didn't you tell me earlier? Would he have gone to an orphanage? -Yes. Don't you know what happens to kids in them? You're getting carried away. They can be very nice. You swore you wouldn't say anything. I know. You can come in. Are you going to take care of him, ma'am? You're all going to go to the police with Martin. I'll go with you if you want. Are you going to tell on us? No, but... I understand your...but I can't, I can't. I mustn't. It's against my ethics. But Claire told us... Claire can be stupid. No, I'm sorry, honey. But what you have done is very serious. We're proud of what we've done! But children can't just... But what more does he need? He's eating well...sleeping well. He didn't do anything bad and he's doing well in school. Better than before! Us too, as a matter of fact. -Tell us what else we should do. I understand, I understand. But I shouldn't understand. You'll have to be the judge. A judge? But we didn't kill his mother. No, a judge for children He'll decide. No social worker went to see him? Just a neighbor and his history teacher. I understand. They're all so busy and they don't realize how grave... There's nothing grave about it! I can't do a thing. I'll keep quiet because I promised... But I must ask you not to tell a soul that I'm privy to all this. It's risky for me to keep quiet. But we trusted you. Do you think I like being cornered? You think that's why I chose this profession? I would have liked... I thought... Injustice is horrible. But often you can't do anything about it. We can, if they'd just leave us alone. OK, go to your class. I'll think all this over. And this is a secret between me and you. Promise? What's the secret? Get lost! Get out of here! Children, calm down! Children! Before class, you will all speak to these men... about one of your classmates. Come this way, with me. Let's hope that Martin stays home. If he comes, we're finished. So? They ask stupid questions...If we know Martin's mother or her boyfriend... ...I told them I thought she and Titanic were a hot item. What?! -No, I'm joking. I swore I knew nothing. -Do they know anything? I don't think so. Except for Clipman's theory. Shhh. Keep quiet. You're late. -Sorry. I forgot something. Martin's safe. -How do you know? He told me everything, bonehead. where is he? -It's a secret. Tell us. Come on. Under one condition. Spit it out, nerd! That you stop teasing me. No more 'nerd', 'kiss-ass', or 'teacher's pet'. Nothing. OK. -Swear it! OK, I'll keep my secret. I may be a pain, but you're in serious trouble. OK, I swear. I swear. -I swear. Who the hell does she think she is? No one tailed you? How dumb do we look? I don't trust anyone. That's why I'm... An idiot! -Shut up. She bugs me. -So find him yourselves. Don't be mean. -Apologize. Sorry. -Sorry who? Sorry, Helene. That's all right, but next time it'll be worse. Come on. Not bad, huh? It's been abandoned for six years. Ah Martin, you're here. -This place is incredible, Martin. I come here to be alone. Even my parents don't know about it. Is that a hang glider? -Yes, but it's not totally finished. Lucky stiff. You're much better off here than at school. One day here is enough for me. I'm going home. And this place is amazing! Look! You were hiding all this? I didn't hide anything. You just had to look closely. How did you find the time? I may be a geek, but I get by. Martin, you have to admit that this hide-out is awesome. You can use the computer if you want. I don't care about all this stuff, I'm going home. They'll nab you. -Good. Off to the orphanage. -Wherever. Hey, don't scream. They'll find my hide-out. Maybe he's right. -Shut your face. Here I'm all alone. -At your house too. But it's my home. I'm staying with you. What about school? And your parents? I'll run away. Again. Are you sick or what? -Leave her alone. She'll attract the cops. I don't need your permission. No, stop... No! Go away! Get out of here! Go! Marianne... Marianne. I'm such an ass. You'll have to tell her that I'm sorry. That I'll do whatever she wants. You'll remember? -OK. Parents aren't allowed to let us go out, cops at school. We have to be careful. Someone will bring him food from all of us. And the homework? Homework too. Despite them, we'll go on as before. Should we tell her what Martin said? -No, things are tough enough. Are you here to work or to play? To play. Hey guys, the cops found the hole! There's nothing in it now. But where are you all going? Move away. Don't stay there. Go on, go on. Get back to school immediately. I can't spend my time running after you. You need the exercise! Who said that? What's more, he's deaf! OK, get going! Back to school. Get going. Who among you know where Martin Gaudinier is hiding? He must think we're really stupid. Very well, let's be honest. I understand the pain your friend is going through The death of a mother is an ordeal. I went through it myself. But at the same time, I respected the rules of the society. But how old were you at the time? That's not the issue. I want to help Martin. We can't leave a child alone in such a situation. There are risks. Like what, sir? Very many risks, believe me. I deal with them every day. He's the biggest one! A society is responsible for its minors. First it will be necessary... ...to keep Martin in a protective environment... ...for his own psychological well-being. But after some time, nothing will stop our putting him in a family. And why not around here? So you see, you can trust me. Do you have any questions? Sir, why is it forbidden to bury bodies wherever you want? Especially because the cemeteries are supposedly full. Don't ask stupid questions! Have you ever arrested a criminal? I'm not a policeman, I'm a judge for children. That must be less fun. And with his raincoat, he sure isn't Colombo! That's enough. Where is Martin? No one wants to answer... ...especially in front of the others. That is why I'll leave a mailbox in your classroom. You can each leave a message even in secret. Antoine! you're not going out? I want some fresh air. -The judge said to keep you inside. Is this a prison? You should have thought of that earlier. Are you sure that he didn't kill her? You're sick. Don't you ever speak to me like that. These days anything can happen. Stay here. Antoine! Hi. No, I can't. Can you? Jerome's allowed to go out. Yeah, well, at least she's your real mother. That's enough, Antoine! Hang up and go to your room. Or else... Talk louder because Steps won't stop shrieking! Happy now? Why are you like this? What do you want? Why don't you love me? Hello, sir. I'm here on behalf of everyone else. We think you're the only person who could adopt Martin. Who? Come in. By the way, did you tell Martin that they found the clock? Dummy! I can't get a word to him at the hide out. We should at least go fill the hole. that way... Where'd they put his mother? -They buried her somewhere else. It's easier for them. You took so long, they all had to leave. I know I'm in big trouble, so I've got nothing to lose. So? It won't work. He can't adopt him because he's not married. If it's just a question of finding him a wife... And I swore not to say anything. Will you keep a secret? Cross my heart! He's homosexual. Him? Are you crazy? He told me. And for adoptions, there's an investigation. That's why it won't work. Also he'd have trouble. That's disgusting? -What? That they give homos such a hard time! -I told him the same thing. He agreed. What are we going to do? -I don't know. Are you still going out with Jerome? -No. Why? -I don't like him. Is there someone else you like? -Yes. Oh, that sucks. -Why? No reason. -Come on. Say it. No. -Come on. Well, if there wasn't already someone, I'd, I'd... Jerome told me that you didn't like me. What an ass. To tell you the truth, I understand because if he likes you... Do you like me? -I think so. You think I'm stupid? Claire! Claire! I've been looking for you for an hour. You were supposed to go home immediately. I can't trust you anymore. And who is the boy? A friend. I thought I could trust you too. Would you like to walk a little with me? Wait, I want to talk. I want to go home. Listen, I'm willing to understand everything. Do you realize that I had to lie to the judge? What for? He knows everything. -Watch your tone. I'm your mother. Get back inside. Let me go. You're not my parents. Get back inside immediately. -I'm fed up. I'm leaving. We weren't the ones lying all this time! We thought you were sleeping at each other's houses. We trusted you. Maybe it's genetic, like they say. But what do you have against me? You're useless. Nicolas is in charge of food. Be careful. Give it to Jerome. He'll give it to Nicolas. Hello children Sit down! Ah! I see you've had some ideas. WE DON'T TRUST YOU. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, YOUR HONOR. Claire, Julien, Jerome, Dede, come this way. It's a piece of cake. Come on, let's go. We go that way. Walk slowly so Nicolas will have time to hide. You go that way and we'll go over there. Is it working? Here comes Pierrot. Helene, you're amazing! Sorry for everything I said. It was easy. what's more stupid than a policeman? Two policemen! And here they're 5 or 6. Hey, hey! They've found him! I didn't see that they followed me. -Are you sure? I was careful, I swear! And Martin? -They took him away. At first he screamed, but the he gave in. All that's left is to write a letter to the president. Marianne...we forgot... ...uh...we didn't have the time to tell you. The other day... ...Martin asked us to apologize for him. As soon as you left. He even said that he would have liked you to stay with him. Is it true? You're not just trying to make me happy? I swear! On my mother's head. My real mother's! It's not too bad after all. I even have some friends. The difference is that here, you have to know how to defend yourself. Fortunately, I was able to steal a knife, and now I get respect. No one cares about the classes. It's a shame because I was starting to like them. Be careful when you write back, because they read our mail. No one read this letter, though. A teacher charged me 20 francs to mail it... So, I'm getting by... The judge doesn't want me to go back because he thinks I was traumatised. The ass said that even if I'm adopted, he wants it to be in another city. Anyway, I'm going to run away one of these days... ...but now I'm being good so that you'll be able to come see me. Quiet, or else you'll all return to your bus. This visit is highly exceptional. It was authorized by the judge... ...in light of the ordeal suffered by Gaudinier. Yet I must insist that absolute order be maintained. OK? Put your presents here on the table. Come on. I'll give them to him myself after your visit. We can't do it ourselves? -After your visit. Hi. -Hi. How's it going? -Great! It's a neat place, isn't it? We wrote to the president. He hasn't answered yet, but... How's Clipman? He sends his love. He sent a present too. That's nice. And Steps? -She doesn't slap anymore. Her new thing is: 'You'll be sorry when I'm gone.' And school? Same old thing. But this term we're all doing bad. Even me. That's normal. I'm not there to help you anymore. Marianne, did they tell you? Yes. I tried something: I complained that my fake parents were hitting me... ...so they'd put me in an orphanage. Maybe we would have been together. You shouldn't have. It didn't work. And now they really hit me. You know, before...it was because I was a little afraid. Of me? Why? There was already a throm broken in the family... So I thought I'd better watch out, you know, with girls. You see? I'd never hurt you. I swear. Do you think I can kiss him? I put a file in the cake. In fact, the walkman is a walkie- talkie. That way we can talk. Enough of this! Move back or I'll throw you all out. There's not that much longer to go. As soon as I'm an adult, everything will be fine. That's a long time. No, it goes by fast. When we're adults, it'll be great. Things will be different. What? What what? Things. What things? Everything. You'll see. Subtitles by Andrew Litvack
