Pretty impressive. Thank you. Miguel speaks very highly of you. He's a great guy. You've worked on the port of America. Yeah, just one floor. So, Troy, you definitely have plenty of credentials. Why L.A.? Why us? Why now? Well, to be honest, uh... As much as I love it there, it's not home, you know Like, I grew up in the Valleys, so California is home for me. And I've heard lot about you back in Spain and I like your work. I think you're provocative and... challenging, which is exactly what I'm looking for. We get this one person just like you, about a year ago. Wanted to move back here from London. Real bright kid, looked promising. Three months and he was back in London. Look, I completely understand, I can tell you that I... really like your company and I think we can work well together. I don't see this as a fad. Hey, can't come to the phone right now, please, leave a message! Hi... This is a message for Jonathan... It's Troy. I'm calling because I... went back in town and I... Hello? No, It's Raul, his boyfriend. Troy. Yes, I've heard a lot about you. You could say that. No, he's not here at the moment. Sure. Sure, no problem. Hold on a second. ::: Subtitles by Natan Caetano ::: Hi! Sorry, I'm late. - I was beginning to worry - Oh, yeah? That I wouldn't come? - No! That something happened. Uh... No, I'm fine. I decided to walk. - God, I haven't been here in ages. - Really? Why? Well, I'm just in the neighborhood anymore. Oh, that's right! You moved. Where are you now? We live in Silver Lake. You look good. Ah, thanks. You too. I'm glad you got my message. I wasn't sure if I... I don't know. I'd always be happy to see each other. You know that. - Oh, no, I don't smoke anymore. - No? No. I quit two years ago. Really? Wow. - No, but you can smoke, though. - No, it's ok. I shouldn't be anyway. So, where are you staying? At your brother's? No! Josh is in Venice. Remember him? I remember the place. He's out of town, so he left me his keys. God, I probably still have a key. You're here for work? Vacation? I'm not sure actually. - I was feeling homesick, I guess. - You're still in Madrid? No. Barcelona, now. Thought I'd come back and check things out for a while. - So, Raul, uh? - Yeah. - And you live together? - He's coming to pick me up, so you'll get to meet him. I look forward to it. - Are you seeing anyone? - No. Really? How come? I mean, someone like you, I thought... - You'd always-- - Stop, I hate it when people say that. I don't know, I'm a... perpetual bachelor, I guess It's my calling in life. Besides, you put a curse on me, remember? - No, I didn't. - You did too, you said: "I hope one day you'll fall in love non-reciprocally, then you'll understand" - Come on, stop. - What? - With this sugar. - I can keep some addictions, can't I? Yes, you can. Hum! Hey, handsome! - This must be Troy. - You must be Raul. - It's good to meet you. - Likewise. - Do you wanna sit? - That's ok, uh... We should go, actually. - I double parked. - The Vespa? Yes, the Vespa. There wasn't any parking around here. We can do this again some other time. And I'm sure we'll see each other again. Yeah, definitely. Oh, uh... Don't worry about it. You sure? Yeah. - Call me. - Definitely! ...how is the clime in here, downtown L.A.? Good morning! Ten minutes after nine in a city touched by Satan or scored by global warm. I tell you it's so hot out there, my cat is only eating ice cream. So hot out there, that a guy was spotted riding his motorcycle on his underwear on the 405! Entered the fifth consecutive day of this die for heat. Hope you got your air conditioning! We should give one away in our show-- Hi! Ok. Gimme the address again. I think he wants you. Not usually like that. Mom called, by the way, looking for you. I told her you'd be here later. - I'll give her a call. Where's Lynn? - At work. This is your uncle. Troy. Hey! Yes, he is! Have a look! Look at you, you're so domestic! Leave you for a few years, you come back and have a family? - I know. You should try it some time. - I don't even know where I'm living tomorrow. - You're still working? - Uhum. I am. Look at this! You're really serious about this, huh? Moving back here? I may be. So, I... did the ex files last week. Who? Jonathan. What happened? - I called him. - Uh. Ok. - And we went for coffee and... then he came over, it wasn't planned. - I see. - Don't judge. - I'm not. I'm listening. And we started making out... and then, all of a sudden, he stopped and left. - And I haven't heard from him since. - What about Miguel, from Barcelona? - we just live together... - Uh. Hey! Told you we would see each other again. - I didn't know that you bartend! - Sometimes. Helping out a friend at his bar. Gotta pay the rent. - I'm Raul. - Oh, sorry, this is my friend Devon. - Pleased to meet you. - So what can I get you, boys? - Vodka tonic. - Ah, Jim Beam on the rocks. That's my drink. - He's hot! - Yeah, he's also Jonathan's boyfriend. - Jonathan has a boyfriend. - Yep. - Oh. - Yeah, and they live together. Jesus... Troy! When did you meet him? Same day I met up with Jonathan. He came to pick him up. - Did you do a threeway? - Hopefully. Here you go... - Ah, don't worry about it. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Thanks. So, what brings you guys here? Um, we've just had dinner and I thought we'd stop for drink on the way home. - Are you staying in the area? - No, I'm staying in Venice. Oh, yeah. At Josh's? I've heard all about that place. It's where you and Jonathan used to hang, right? Yeah. Don't worry about it. I think it's great that you guys are finally hanging out. It helps heal things. Plus, I've always wanted to meet you. That was like, kinda awkward... I think I'm gonna go home. No, no! Michael wants to see you! Hey! So... I think I got a new job. We should celebrate. Oh. What gallery?... Ok... Yeah, maybe... ...92 degrees and climbing in downtown L.A. Good morning! Ten minutes after nine in a city touched by Satan or scored by global warm. I tell you it's so hot out there, my cat is only eating ice cream. So hot out there, there a guy was spotted riding his motorcycle on his underwear on the 405! 405... A high of 102 today, not a cloud in the sky, but a fuzzy haze as we enter the-- - Can't breathe. - I know. The fires. - No. We need AC. - Then get one. It's your apartment. - You working from home today? - Yeah... Then why don't you look for an air conditioner? - What? - Nothing. How was your meeting with Troy? Weird... - Ok... - That's Troy. Yes, I know. - You look nice. - Thanks. I'm meeting my immigration attorney. Oh, nice... Good luck! Saturday, Eight, Twelve AM. Hi, this is a message for Jonathan... It's Troy. I'm calling because I, uh... Ah, he's here long last! We're having a little private party. I can see that. - Long time no see. - I know. He's passing by and we, uh... thought we'd stop for a drink. Uh... It just can't be coming like this... - The owner is a friend of ours. - Yeah, we know... Hello? Hey, bitch! What's up? - You're coming from work now? - Yeah. - I didn't think I'd see you again. - Why? - You left in a hurry last week. - That was the right thing to do. What do you mean? What do you mean "what do I mean"? It sucks that you have a boyfriend. Why? What would've happened? Michael wants me to pass later. We should hang out sometime, have dinner or something. - Yeah, definitely. - Cheers! Will you... the ashtray? Give me one. Cute. Come help me look at a place today? What's that? - Hm hm. Tell'im you can't. - Yeah? It's near your office. Hey... Yeah, I got them. Look, I don't know, I don't think it's... It's not what I should be viewing with you, Troy. No... When? No, what time? Fine, yeah, ok. I will meet you. See you there. - I need help. - I'm trying. - Hi, I'm Lisa. - I'm Troy. So sorry I'm late, I'm trying to run around in this heat It's not working very well... The owner just redid the whole place, really, it's all new, you don't find a lot of these around here. He lives in Florida, so he won't bother you guys very much. - So, who takes care of the place? - The manager. He's great. And what's the parking situation? You get one space with the rent in the back and there's street parking No permit needed, so one of you could park on the street. - And it's available immediately, right? - Yes, They just need to finish painting. I can have it for you on the first. - You're the second person I showed it to. - Oh, what did the first person say? She likes it. - Washer or dryer? - In the basement. - And how much is this again? - US$ 2000. Jesus... But, between you two, it's only a 1000 apiece. Not bad. - Since when did L.A. get to be so expensive? - You don't need to take it. But yeah, it is depressing... This place hasn't changed at all. - Yeah, Josh said he painted it... - Really? It looks the same to me. Remember that guy who used to pee out that window? That was so hot. How come we never really stayed at my place? We always came here, like... neutral ground or something. More like our own private ground... Do you know how long it took me to get over you? - Did you? - Can't you tell? I think that's good. Why did you call, Troy? After all this time. I don't know. - What do you mean you don't fucking know? - I mean... Let me get some water. - I've been meaning to call for a long time... - But? No buts, I always wanted to tell you that... I... I wanted you to know that it wasn't easy for me. I didn't just leave and forget everything. Your call was after a week... to dump me. Look... That was... crazy days. And you can hardly say that things were... perfect for a relationship. I guess. It's all about timing, isn't it? - Synchrony... - Come on... - We were so young... - Yes, we were. - Is it not your birthday soon? - Yes, it is. My 30th... - You're thirty? - Yeah!... Not yet. Hm, I should probably go. - Hey. - Heey. - So it is. - It's my life. You don't have to keep doing this. - Doing what? - Wouldn't it be easier for you to just move in already? - Like you keep saying you will? - I practically live here already. - Exactly. - So what's the difference? Besides that, I like having my own space. - What? - Nothing. - Come on, don't be like that... - Suit yourself. What? I don't think so... Like, no matter which way It just... it is... I mean... well, that's because everything - ...is falling under that clich? umbrella. - Nothing is new... I'm sorry, that's how I feel. - Hey! You made it. - Yeah, despite the traffic. - Where you're coming from? - Venice. - Far. - Spain, really... Even farther. - Wow, your head! - Yeah, I buzzed it today. Nice... Oh. Nina, Troy; Troy, Nina. - It's nice to meet you. Finally. - Oh, thanks. - So, why did you buzz your head? It used to be this way, I go back and forth. - You used to too, yeah? - Yeah, long time ago. - Who's that? - My next husband. - He's wondering where I was. Ain't that sweet? - Thank you. - Oh, perfect timing. - Cheers. - Cheers. To new friends. And old friends. They don't let you smoke in this country... That goes with my drink. - Go outside. - They don't let you drink outside. Don't. There's smog and fires everywhere and they don't let you smoke. - I bet they let you smoke in Europe. - They do, yeah. - I wish I could move to Europe. - It's not all like glamourous. - Yes, it is! I wanna take a "vacance"! It's all work in this town. - Stay in Europe. - Ah... My heart is here. You spend your whole twenties running away from home and then You get to your thirties and you realize you just wanna go back to it. You're romanticizing, Troy... I think once you move here you'll realize all is not so great As you make that do be and you'll want to move back. Really? Well, why don't you move to Spain and we'll switch? - Oh, that's sweet, but I can't. - Sure you can. - No, I can't, I'm married. - Oh, you are? Ah, yeah, Nina married Raul, so that he could stay in the country. Jonathan drugged me and begged me to do it... "Oh, Nina, please, come on, he's the love of my life..." Clearly you lied. I'm gonna... get the man's room. - Hi... - What are you doing? - You're out of control. - You even like him being back here? - I find it... terribly confusing. - I hope you figure that out. - It was nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. Oh, ok. Good night. Good night. - Be good. - I'll try. I'm wasted... Oh, God, turn it off. I thought you said it's not usually like this. - What's wrong with you anyway? - Nothing, just hangover. Oh. You knew you'd be coming here today and you go out drinking. Grow up, Troy. - I am grown up. - Yep. - I got a job. - That's great. And what does Jonathan think about this? He's happy, I think... We went out celebrating last night. Who needs to grow up now? - I don't think you're doing the right thing. - What do you mean? Just an observation. You barely even know him, you met him, like, twice, maybe, that summer. Yeah, but I know you and you don't know what you want. And I don't think you have the right to barge into someone's life and mess it up again just to figure out if it works up at this time. - What? And I messed it up the first time? - Troy. I would love you to move back here, find a boyfriend, a job, be an uncle. Everyone would love that. But don't just do it based on some romantic issue of the past. - I think you're wrong. - You are having an affair. - And you're like the... other woman - I'd like to think - that I'm more than that. - And nothing good ever comes out in affair, - believe me. - What is up with you? Get off my back! Leave. You're not gonna smoke, are you? You can have one outside, - only when he's sleeping-- - Ok! Nice head, by the way. 92 degrees and rising in downtown L.A.. Again, is this the hottest week in history or what? Oh, well, if you're inside, I hope you stay cool! We are looking at a stifling 100 degrees today in downtown, high 80s in the beaches and 115 in Palm Springs! Very low of humidity with these Santa Ana winds, but you know what? That's not record breaking. June 26th 1990 holds the record of 112 degrees at Civic Center. Wow! And there's still all these fires going on. - Hm! Yes! - How do you break the heat? Well, if you're off today, head out to the beach! - And if you're not... - Oh! You're screwed! - When did we submit this? - Like 4 months ago, I expect you to know. - Yes, well, ever since 09-11 here things become more conversing than before, if you can imagine. Everything takes longer now. It's just that you said it would take 2 months. That's the usual processing time for employment authorization, yes. If we had an estimate? I mean, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I can't get a real job and... You can do nothing but wait. Hello?... Jay? - Stop... - Sorry. I think it's really done this time. It's a blackout. Hand me the water. So where were you last night? I went out with Nina and Troy. - Good times? - Yeah. - So you and Troy good now? - I guess... Yeah. Great. Should I... should I invite him to the party? - What? - Is your entire harem coming? No, just him. Thought you wanted us all to hang out. - Ah, is that it? - Just forget it... Do what you want. It's your birthday. - I don't even want this party. - Of course you do, it's your 30th. Besides, Nina and I need pictures for the photo album. Wasn't it why you're going to Malibu? - "You're"? - I can't. I have to work. You're leaving me alone with Nina and Nick. She's your wife. Oh, thank God... Oh, stop! Stop!... I'll kill you. They're here. - Nina's gonna be pissed. - Tell her to get off my back. You tell her to get off your back. Hey... What are you doing? I'm at the beach... Yeah... You should come join us. Bring your stuff out here. Don't be so lazy, just jump in your car and get here. - C'mon, I'm not good enough for you? - What? You had to invite Jonathan... - Do you mind? - Nope. Smile... I like it, I guess. Finally, some authenticity! Now, one to me... Ok. - Do you want some? - Yep. - I'm going in. - Should. Haha... Cute. - This is where we met. - Yeah... God, five years ago! Memorial day... We had a great summer. And a terrible fall. I'm sorry. Are you upset? - What? - You're not upset? - About what? - About Jonathan not coming! - No. - Not even a tiny bit? - What's the point? - Well, I'm upset! And if I get upset, what good would that do? Being upset makes you act, do something! How do you want me to act, Nina? He's a big boy. He knows what he's doing and he should take responsibility for it. He's a child, Raul, and none of you take responsibility - for anything you do! - How could you say that? What the fuck are you doing here? All of this so we can stay together. Exactly! So you and Jonathan can stay together, not anybody else! Raul, when an ex comes to town, he usually messes things up, especially one of the magnitude of Troy. God, Nina! Let it go! It's because it's Troy! They need to sort things out. What do you want me to do? It must be nice dating a chef. Would you and Nick've gotten married if it wasn't for me? I don't know, I don't think so. - Maybe it's a sign. - What? Troy... Maybe I'm not meant to be here. I can't work, can't see my family... Too much sacrifice. Raul is gonna kill me. You know what? I think you're the devil. No... - You're smoking now? - Yep. You make me. I'm not making you do anything. - So, did you find an apartment? - Not yet. - What? - Nothing. I love Raul. - Well, that fucking sucks... - Well, I guess it's all about timing. - Oh, fuck that. - Fuck you. You come and you go and you can't even find an apartment! I will! I got a new job, didn't I? I got a sense that you wanted this too. - Want what? - This... This. - You... - What? I was gonna move with you. I was gonna move to Spain. I was gonna move with you, Troy. - Come to bed... - I am in bed, stupid. And I should be in Malibu right now. It's a fucking curse you put on me, you should cancel it. No, I think I like it and I think I'm gonna increase it tenfold. - Why? - Cause you deserve it. - When is Josh back? - Next week. - And what're you gonna do then? - I don't know. Devon has a friend who's downtown and got a place in Silvelake, - I may move in there... - Silver Lake? Raul is throwing a... birthday bash next weekend. Am I invited? Do you wanna be? Look at us... - Hey! - Heey! What's this? It's too hot, so... Who did that to you? Troy. - Oh... - Yeah, you like it? - Did Troy shave his head too? - Yeah... - I thought you had things to do. - I did, I got them all done, so... So you look alike again. How was the weekend? Fine. You missed out, we had quite a few feasts. - We do not look alike. - I bet you do, Jonathan. What's all this? Stuff for your damn birthday party, which I don't know why I bother with. I went to some US$0,99 store and got a bunch of stuff. You see. Some people think of their boyfriends when they're away for the weekend. - I hope you know what you're doing. - I was hoping you did. - Hey! - Happy birthday. - Thanks! - 30 is when real life begins. - So you're coming from New York for this. - Yes, yes. Alright, yeah, he did not... - How do you like L.A., Brandon? - I like the climate. Don't tell me you're moving back. - Thinking 'bout it. - And why? You... got in touch with Jonathan? - Yeah. - Why? - What do you mean? - Well, you're not trying to get back with him, - are you? - No... Hello, they're beautiful together. Yes, but... you're Troy. You've been hard for him, you know? Took him a while to get over you... Yeah, so I've heard. So, how come I've never heard of you? - Uh, I don't know... - You're friends with Jonathan, ain't that right? - Troy, mostly... - Oh, ok. - Should I leave or... - God, no, not at all! - Look, I'm sorry, that came out wrong, I guess. I'm not really sure I'm supposed to be here. Troy didn't want me to be alone, so it was a safety measure... - Yeah, right, some moral support. - I think so. You know, if you ask me, it's nobody business, but uh... - Ah, there you are... - Hey, babe. I need you to help with the cake. - I'm gonna steal him. - Duty calls. See you. Hey, guys, c'mon! We're going out. Kiss. Fucking kiss. Troy... Hey! How you've been? Fine. Well, we haven't seen you in a while. Yep. - You were here? - I just finished. My office is around the corner, so I come here a lot. - I'm leaving back to Spain. - You are? - Yeah? - Wow! - What? - Nothing, it's a bit sudden. That's all. We'll miss you. When? Saturday. Well... Call before you leave. Sure. Just because you said goodbye, doesn't mean you can't change your mind. Thanks for letting me stay. :: Transcription, revision and synchronization: Natan Caetano ::
