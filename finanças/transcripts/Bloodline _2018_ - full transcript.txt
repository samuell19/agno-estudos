(door creaking, gasps) (techno music) (tense violin music) (baby crying) - Go back to sleep. - Are you sure? - Shh... Shh... Shh... Shh.... Shh... Shh... Shh... Shh... It's okay, Andrew. Daddy's here. (suspenseful music) (bell ringing) How's your mom doing, Ray? - Okay. - What about your dad? - What about him? - Do you want to talk about how things have been since he's been out? - No. (bell ringing) - Was it worth it? I could recommend that they not suspend you, but you gotta promise me this is the last time. Do you even want to finish high school? (bell ringing) - Eat a dick. - What about your uncle? Has he been around since the last time we talked? Kelly? (bell ringing) He thinks you'll get the scholarship? - What can I say, Mr. C? I'm good at math. - Wow. That's great, Chris. What does your mom say? - Eh, it's hard for her, you know? Without my dad being around, and she doesn't really have anyone else, so having me at home, well... - It's a comfort. - Yeah. I don't want to leave her alone. - Well, she has to see that this is the best thing for you. This is your chance. - I know, I know, it's... What if I go and she's just...? You know, or, um... uh, I can't handle the workload, or... all the rich kids hate me. - None of that's gonna happen, okay? If you want, I can come to your house and talk to your mom. - Can you? - For you, I can. - Thanks, Mr. C, but I'll handle it myself. Uh... Here. It was really good. - Glad you liked it. (bell ringing) (door opening and closing) How was he today? - Busy. Look. - Holy shit. (soft sigh) - Ohh. - My mom called earlier. She offered to come stay after the baby's born. - Let's see, okay? I want to try this on our own. - I just wanted you to know it was an option. - Ohh. Sweetheart? Honey. Ohh. Ohh. (soft gasps) Evan! (exhales, gasps, moans) (medical machine beeping) (exhales) - You're doing great, baby. (loud moan) - You might want to come over here, Dad. Okay, Mom, ready? (pained moans) Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. (moans) Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push (screams) (moans) (gasps, baby crying) - Hello. Hello, sir. Welcome to the world. - Hello, my loves. - Mom, you made it. (gasps) - There he is! Ohh! Isn't he beautiful? - Marie! You need to wash your hands. - Oh! Of course. I'm sorry, sweetheart. And how's Mom doing? - Great. (soft gasp) - Look at this big boy. How much does he weigh? - Seven and a half pounds. - Seven pounds, five ounces, actually. - Evan was nine pounds. (soft chuckle) That was quite the labor. But he was so calm, never made a peep. Ohh. Shh... (baby crying) There you go. Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. (soft gasp) - Shh. (sharp intake of breath) Ow. - Not like that. Here. (baby crying) - Nurse, may I suggest being a little more gentle? This is their first baby. - Ma'am, may I suggest you let me do my job? Because if she can't feed him, the baby'll lose too much weight, and then we'll have to intervene. There. Like that. - Well, she's quite the charmer. Evan, honey... Why don't I go pick up some food for everyone, hmm? Everything is going to be fine, sweetheart, you'll see. And if you need me to come and stay for a while, you know there's nothing I'd rather do. - That's okay, Marie. I think we'll manage on our own. - Yeah, thanks, Mom, we got this. - Hmm. - Hi, Andrew. This is your dad. First of all, many congratulations on being born. It looked painful, and a little disgusting. But you made it. Well done. I thought we could take this opportunity to have a little chat, mano a mano. I will never hurt you. I will never judge you. And I will never leave you. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. (church bells ringing, birdsong) (baby crying) - Shh. - Should we try a bottle? - No. If we give him the bottle, he won't go back to breastfeeding. - Okay, sweetheart. - Shh. - Can I help? - Not unless you can grow a pair of tits. - I'll get right on that. (baby crying) (gasps) - Come on, Andrew, come on. (sharp gasp) (crying) He's not gaining weight. (gasping) Why won't you let me help you? (crying softly) Here, baby. (baby's cries overlapping) (baby crying in distance) (intense music) (voices whispering) (distorted) - ...kill you, you little shit! - Get the fuck away from him. Evan, go to your room. (man grunts) - I'm-- I'm sorry, Marie. I didn't-- I didn't mean to. - Get out. - You know I didn't mean it, right, Evan? - I promise you, I will kill you if you don't leave immediately. You're okay, sweetheart, everything's gonna be okay. (kiss) Mother's here. Shh. Shh. (Marie whispering): You're okay, sweetheart. Everything is okay. (soft gasp) Shh... Shh. Shh. - I hope you don't mind, I let myself in. - Let me know if it gets too cold at night. - I will, dear. Thank you. How are you doing, Evan? - I'm good. I'm always good, Mom. - Sit. Tell me. - I'm okay, really. But Lauren... - It's hard for new mothers. How can you take care of her and Andrew, if you don't take care of yourself? It's okay, my darling. Everything is going to be okay. Mother's here. (muffled speech) - Mr. C? Hey. You okay? - Sorry, buddy. Baby isn't really sleeping. It's just, um... Just is what it is. You know? What's going on with your dad? Any news? - Oh, um... For Andrew. - Wow, Chris. You know you didn't have to. - After everything you've done for me? Yeah, I did. - So, has there been any word from your dad? (bell ringing) - Um... Try to get some sleep, okay? (door opening) (sighs) (over headphones): I hope you can understand, man. I don't think you know what it's like. (indistinct muttering) You know, I lost my job, I was drinkin'. You know how it is, right, man? When your wife's screaming at you, and your kids start mouthing off. So I just hit 'em. And I kept hitting 'em. It was like something broke inside and I couldn't stop. I really didn't mean to hurt anyone. Please, man. I never meant to hurt anyone. This rage, it just comes over me. Deep down, I'm a good person. (knocking on door) - I'm the oldest... So I can take it. But he came after James. So I stepped in. (sighs) - You know I have to report this, legally. They may send him back in if he's found in violation of parole. How do you feel about that? (sniffs, coughs) - Whatever. He gets what he deserves, right? - Ray, everything's gonna be okay. (intense music) (laughter in distance) (man): Hey! Fuck you. Fuck you! You're a fuckin' traitor! (spits) (car door opens and closes) - Hey, buddy. Let me help you. Hey. Hey, are you all right? - Huh? - You need a ride? - What, are you queer? Huh? - No, I'm a driver. Looks like you need some help getting home. Everyone could use a ride now and then. No charge. - "What about immigrant rights?" What about my fuckin' rights? (sighs) Fuckin' wetbacks. Fuck that. Fuckin' everywhere, man. Every fuckin' where you look. Everywhere you look. It's time the white man took this country back, hmm? You hear me? - I hear you. - Left here, left here. Stay in here. (crickets chirping) You got anything to drink in there? (soft groan) - Nobody knows you're here? - Been here a year. I never seen anyone. Make yourself at home. (grunts) (soft groans) What the fuck? Oh yeah, very funny, man. Let me go, okay? Let me go, you fucking psycho! (groans, coughs) Why are you doing this? - Louis Jackson. (breathes heavily) - Come on, man, you got the wrong guy. Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anyone anything. I don't even know who you are. - Do you know who this is? (man scoffs) - What'd that little faggot say to you? Hmm? - By "little faggot," you mean your son? - Fuck you! You fucking-- (spits) (coughs) (spitting, laughs) Oh, yeah. You're pretty tough against a guy tied up, hmm? Why don't you untie me, see how easy it is then? - As easy as a grown man beating the shit out of a young boy? As easy as a father taking his big, ex-con fists, and pounding them into the flesh of his firstborn? - Fuck you, you fucking cocksucker, fuck you! (groaning) No, ohh! (gasping) Okay, okay. Fuck. I'm sorr-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Louis... Please describe to me the feelings and sensations you experience when beating your son. (gasping) - I never meant to-- to hurt them, okay? I... I just got this thing... inside of me. It builds and it builds, and-- and the kids, they push and they push and they push, you know? And-- and then it has to come out, and I gotta let it out. You know? I would never hurt my boys, okay? You understand that, right? - Of course I do. (groans) (gasping) Thank you for sharing, Lou. (gasping) (intense techno music) - Where'd you go? - Just went for a drive to clear my head. - Hmm. - Coach let me go into practice a little late so I can pick up James and bring him with me. - That's great news, Ray. And your mom? - She's been doin' great. I mean, since my dad took off again. - I'm glad to hear it. Where's Andrew? - He's with his grandma. You're home early. - I got lucky. Maybe it'll happen twice today. - The doctor said we have to wait. - It's a long wait. You look good, you know? - No, I don't. - You do, you look beautiful. I know it's been hard. - I'm sorry, I... I've been difficult. - Shh. You've been a champ. - I thought he wasn't eating, and... that fucking nurse saying I was doing it wrong, and all the studies say how bad formula is, and I thought... ...this is it. I'm failing. I'm failing at being a mother. - Forget the nurse and the studies. Okay? You're a great mother. - You don't know, Evan. You sleep most of the night and go to work during the day, and it's just me and Andrew, and I thought... I thought I was doing everything wrong, and I thought if I-- if I can't do this right, you would take him and leave me alone, and I can't be alone. Not again. I won't let Andrew grow up without a family. - Neither will I. I'll never leave you two. (TV in background) (sighs) - Can you please tell your mother not to watch TV with Andrew? (TV): Have you tried every fad diet, one after the other? We've done them all. - Oh, you're your daddy's little man, aren't you, Andrew? So handsome already. - Mom. - Yes, dear? - Lauren doesn't want you watching with Andrew. - It won't hurt him, dear. He doesn't even know what it is. - Mom, Lauren doesn't like it. - You need to be careful with her. She's delicate. - I know. - Look, it's not like I want him around or anything, it's just... been a while since we've heard from him, you know? Uh, his parole officer called looking for him. Did you report the thing last time? - I followed procedure. - Do you know what happened? - What happens after isn't up to me. But how many times has he just disappeared? I'm sure he'll just show up. Unfortunately. - Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. - He came over a couple days ago. My mom told him to leave. Told him she would call the cops. - Did he hurt you again? Kelly. This is not your fault. Do you want to tell me what happened? (bell ringing) - See you next week, Mr. Cole. (Evan): Now, Fredrick, please describe to me the feelings and sensations you experience when raping your 15-year-old niece, Kelly. - You've seen her, right? She may be fifteen, but she's no little girl. (cries out, coughs) - Shh. Yes, I've seen her. - Tell me you didn't think about fucking that sweet little mouth of hers. It's not rape if she wants it. She always wanted it. Just look at her. (cries out) Oh, fuck! (gasping) What the fuck, man? - Please, continue. (gasping) - Jesus fuckin' Christ, man! What the-- (gasping) (cellphone ringing) - Hi, baby. (Lauren): Where the fuck are you? Andrew's got a 105-degree temperature. We're taking him to the hospital right now. - Okay, stay calm. I'll meet you there. (cellphone beeping) Fuck. (gasping) - Jesus fuck! Jesus fuck! - Fuck. - Fuck! Fuck! - We're gonna have to cut this short, I'm afraid. - Jesus fuck. No! (cries out) (gasping, choking) (breathing heavily) (indistinct chatter over speaker) - Where were you? - I couldn't sleep, so I took a drive. - Thank God you were there, Marie. - Of course, dear. - He's gonna be okay. - How the hell do you know? - He's fine. He must have picked up a cold somewhere. We gave him some Tylenol to bring down the fever, and we're running a couple final tests, and then you can take him home. - Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. - Um... it's not unusual for babies to run a fever, so... try not to get hysterical at every little thing. - Can we ride back with you? Marie can take my car. - Yeah, of course. (sirens wailing in distance) - Seems like he's better already, right? (sirens wailing in the distance) - Why don't I help you, dear? Hmm? You've had quite the night. - We all have, I think. Thank you, Marie. (baby crying over monitor) (Marie over monitor): There, there, little man. Still feeling poorly? ¶ Hush a-bye ¶ ¶ Don't you cry ¶ ¶ Go to sleep ¶ ¶ My little baby ¶ ¶ When you wake ¶ ¶ You shall have ¶ ¶ All the pretty ¶ ¶ Little horses ¶ ¶ Hush a-bye ¶ ¶ Don't you cry ¶ ¶ Go to sleep ¶ ¶ My little baby ¶ ¶ When you wake ¶ ¶ You shall have ¶ ¶ All the pretty ¶ ¶ Little horses ¶ (intense techno music) - Hey. (baby fussing) Yeah. Next time, Daddy's gonna make sure it's done right. Yes, he is. He's gonna make sure he gets what he needs. A happy daddy makes a happy home. (knocking, sighing) (soft music) I'm trying, Andrew. But it's hard. (cellphone vibrating) Hello? (Chris): Mr. C? It was my fault. I mean, it's just with my mom, you know, and... they were, uh... (sighs) I heard around that he was back, and... there he was, in my kitchen, half naked. And my mom, she's just acting like this is totally cool, totally okay and normal. They're fucked up, and it just... Just pissed me off. I shouldn't have yelled at him, though. - It's not your fault, Chris. Everything will be fine. I'll make sure of it. - I don't know what I'd do without you, Mr. Cole. For real. - You went out again last night. - Chris called. He needed to talk. - Shouldn't you save that for school? - He's a special kid. His dad beat the fuck out of him. I can help him. Is that where you were the night Andrew went to the hospital? - Good morning, everyone. Lovely day, isn't it? - I have to go to work. - He just needs a little space, dear. - Thank you, Marie. It really makes a big difference having you here. (Chris): Hello? - Hey, Chris, it's Mr. Cole. You missed our meeting today. Is everything okay? (Chris): Ah, shit. Yeah, I'm-I'm good. Sorry. My dad picked me up early and took me to a movie. I-I completely forgot. - Really? That concerns me, after our last conversation. - No, it's good, Mr. C. He's getting clean for real. I-I really think it's gonna be different this time. He apologized. Feel really good about this, you know? I gotta go. See you soon, okay? - Hey. I got kidney stones. I-I just need to see a doctor to get something for the pain. I'm dying over here. - Get out of here, junkie, before we call the cops. - That's not necessary. - Go! (sighs) All the winners come out at night. Thank God my shift's over. (intense techno music) (footsteps echoing) (distant clattering) (techno music continues) (music intensifies) (Evan): Hey there. (music stops) - Hey. Uh... I-I was just lookin' for... - Oh, shh. It's cool. (pills rattling) (stammering) - Well, yeah, I'm a little... short on funds right now. - Consider it a gift from a new friend. (pills rattling) (sharp gasp) (gurgling) (intense music) - Mark Wells. - The hell is this? What the hell is this? - You told him you were cleaning up, yet here you are. - Told who? I don't know what you're talking about. - No? I'll give you a hint. You've been lying to this person his entire life. - What? Look, I-I have no idea what's going on here, man, okay? So... please, just... untie me and let me go. You made a mistake. I won't say anything to anybody, okay? - Mark, please describe to me the feelings and sensations you experience when beating your son. (deep breath) - You're that counselor. Chris... told me about you. I mean, he talks about you all the time, actually. - We're not here to talk about me. (labored breath) You've done this before. How many times? - This is not about me. Now, tell me about how you hurt Chris. (crying) - My wife and I were fightin', and-and... (exhales) Chris just got in the way, but... It wasn't me. It-it-it was the addiction. It was the person that I become when I get high. (grunts, gasping and coughing) I have a disease, man. I-I relapsed. You're a shrink, right? I relapsed. Relapse is a part of recovery, isn't it? Please. - I'll let you in on a little trade secret. That AA stuff is total bullshit. All Chris wants is to know that his father loves him, like every other kid, and you betray him over and over and over again. Because you like to get high. You could give a fuck about your son. I know you, Mark. We've met a thousand times. Now, why did you really come back? - I love my son. I want to get better. I want my family back. Please. Please. Ahh! I swear! I swear! I just want a chance-- I just want a chance at a relationship with my son. Hmm? As a father, you gotta understand that. Please, I'm begging you, please. I know. I know you think I came back for the money. I didn't. I didn't know. - What money? - Chris didn't tell you? His mom, some uncle she hadn't seen in years left her... I don't know, man, I-- please, please, just... I don't know, man, please. I know guys like you. Prison's full of 'em. Monsters hiding in plain sight. You'll never really be a father... or a husband. You'll never love anybody else that much. What are you gonna do? Hmm? What are you gonna do when they find out who you really are? - Thank you for sharing. (sharp groan) (crying) - Mom? - Hi, honey. - What are you doing, Mom? - Just a bit of gardening, honey. - I saw you, Marie. - You're not taking him anywhere. - I need you to come with me, all right? I'm gonna take care of you now. Doesn't that sound great? - You get the fuck away from him. (man): Come on, we gotta go. (Marie shouting, grunting) Bitch! I am never gonna hurt you again, I promise. Everything's gonna be okay. (gurgling) - You're a good boy, Evan. Mommy loves you, and I'm never gonna let anything bad happen to you. Everything's gonna be okay. - I'm glad you're taking care of yourself. - Did you go for another drive tonight? - Mm-hmm. - I need to know if you're okay. - It's been stressful, but I feel better. - I need you here with us, Evan. - I'm here. (TV in background) - Honey... I thought you told her not to watch TV with the baby. - I did. Sorry. (news reporter): In other news, shock and horror today at the Pine Street Development, abandoned and sitting empty since 2008. A woman walking her dog in the area was stunned to discover the body of an adult male buried amidst the deserted property. (Lauren): Marie, please, don't watch TV with Andrew. (news reporter): Three victims have been confirmed, but police believe there may be more. - I'm sorry. It won't happen again. - Okay. Thank you. - It's my fault. I hated him. - It's not your fault, Ray. - I hated him, but I didn't want him dead. - Ray, I promise things will get better with time. - How the fuck do you know? - I know. Kelly, let's talk about this. How you feel about what happened to your uncle? - He wasn't the best dad, but he was my dad, and he was changing. He really was, Mr. Cole. Whoever did this took away my only chance to ever really know him. You know, the real him. - Chris, I know this is hard... But do you really think he was gonna be able to stay sober? I'm sorry for the pain that you're going through. I know it's almost impossible to find any glimmer of hope in these moments, but... Don't you think that this is maybe a blessing in disguise for you and your mom? - How could you even say that? - I've known many men just like your father. My father was just like him, and he did to me the same things your father was doing to you. He was never gonna change. I think deep down you know that. - No. He was spending time with me, he was going to AA, he was getting help. - He lied to you. Don't you think it's a bit convenient that he shows up clean and sober right when your mom gets some big inheritance? - How did you know about the inheritance? - Well, you told me in our last session. Don't you remember? - No. I don't remember that. - Well, I can understand that. Periods of high stress can affect memory. It's quite common, actually. - Yeah, okay, sure. You're probably right. - Chris. We're not finished talking about this. - Uh, I'll see you. I'll see you later, Mr. C. (knocking) - Good afternoon, ma'am, I'm Detective Overstreet. Is this Evan Cole's residence? - Yes. - And you're Mrs. Cole? - Yes. What's this about? - Well, I just need to speak with your husband, Mrs. Cole. Is he home? - No, but he should be shortly. - I can wait. Mr. Cole, I'm sure you've heard by now about the burial site that was uncovered over near the Pine Street Development. - I heard. It's horrible. - Did you know all three men had one thing in common? They all have relatives that are students at your school. In fact... I believe you see all of the students in question. - Yes, of course. They're... they're very upset. It's very hard on them. I'm sure you know, Detective...? - Overstreet. - ...Overstreet. All my clients are children at risk. Many of them have problematic family lives-- drug abuse, criminality, mental illness. Often their family members are at risk themselves. And our school is a regional high school, with over 5000 students, so... - Yeah, well, uh... We have several options that we're looking into right now. How long have you been a counselor there? - Social worker. - Oh... - Little over a year. Are you saying that you think that I might have something to do with this? - It raises some red flags. But I'm just covering all my bases. - Of course. - You understand. - We've all got a job to do. - Mmm. (quietly, pen scribbling) Social... Now, where were you working before? - I'm happy to send my employment record if you like. - Uh... okay. Thank you. And, uh... Here's my card. Any information will be helpful. I'll show myself out. Uh, Mrs. Cole... Has your husband had any late night absences that you've noticed? (Marie): Of course not, officer. My son is a very dedicated father and husband. - Mrs. Cole? - No. Nothing like that. - Are you a heavy sleeper, Mrs. Cole? (baby crying) - Excuse me, Detective. - Oh, no, no. Here you go, Mom. - Thank you, Marie. Shh, shh. - Thank you. - Don't. - What is it? - Nothing. It's nothing. (birdsong) (knocking) Oh, hello, Detective. Evan's still at work. - I'm not here to see Mr. Cole, ma'am. - What is this about? - Um... Do you know Chris Wells? - He's one of Evan's patients. - Did your husband ever see him outside of his office? - No. - Are you sure? - What are you trying to say, Detective? - How long... have you... known your husband? - Three years. Why? - You know where he lived before you met? - Uh, near the desert. I really don't see why this matters at all, Detective. - Uh, well, a year after he left Hemet, police uncovered a site not unlike the Pine Street Development. - What does that have to do with anything? - Maybe nothing, but it's my job to see connections, and right now, I have to say, I'm beginning to see something. - Do you know where your husband was the night of Thursday, March 26th? - I do, actually. He was at the hospital with me. Our son was running a high fever, and we took him into the E.R. - Uh... Now, this camera is at the corner of Third and MacDonald. Now, is this on the way to the hospital from here? 'Cause I have to admit, I don't know this neighborhood very well. - Do you have kids, Detective? - Never had the urge. - When you have a baby, everything changes. But not like everyone says. It's like you're going crazy. You never sleep. The baby cries all the time. Every little thing feels like a crisis. I can't even describe to you what it feels like to be filled with love and total panic at the same time. - Yeah, well, I'm sure it's very difficult, Mrs. Cole, but-- - My husband deals with people in crisis every day, and he was coming home and feeling like he was in crisis. He took drives, alone at night, for some space and peace, and do you know what? I totally understand. And I gave him that space, and trusted that he would come home. And he did. He always did. - Hmm. Give me a call if you think of anything else... or you just want to talk. Because from where I'm standing, it's just a matter of time. - Thank you, Detective. I'll keep that in mind. That detective came over again. - Oh, yeah? What'd he want? - Asked me a bunch of questions. About where you lived before you moved here. And he also asked me where you were the night we took Andrew to the E.R. - Really? What'd you tell him? - That we were at the hospital, of course. - Well, hopefully he won't be back around to bother you again. - Hopefully. (TV in background) - I'll tell her to turn it off. (Evan): Mom. (TV): Police are trying to find a connection between Caroline Herrington, a nurse in pediatric care at Temescal Hospital, who was found on a gurney outside the morgue, having been brutally murdered. It seems the killing occurred in the staff locker room as Miss Harrington was finishing her night shift. What a week. Well, after that, I sure could use some good news. Over to Brian with-- - Turn it off. - Of course, dear. (weatherman): Thanks, Diane. Sunny skies and 72 all weekend. It's a good one to pack up the-- (knocking) (Chris, at a distance): Mr. C? Come out here, Mr. C! - What is it? - It's Chris Wells. I'll take care of it. It's okay. I got it. (pounding on door) - Mr. C! Mr. C! - Chris. Hey. You all right? - I know it was you. - What was me, buddy? - I know you killed my dad. - Chris, you're drunk. - I never told you about the money. I know it. Which means he told you. - Calm down. Let me make you some coffee, and we'll talk. - I don't think so, Mr. C. Tell me the truth. - I would never do anything to hurt you. You're like a son to me, Chris. I just want the best for you. - Evan. - It's okay, Lauren. Take Andrew back to his room. Lauren. It's okay. It's okay, Chris. You'll be all right. Shh. Shh. You'll be okay. It's all right. (Chris crying) Shh. Shh. It's okay. Shh. Shh. You're gonna be okay. Come on, let me take you home. You sleep this off. - Don't touch me! (door slamming) - I'm sorry about that. He's confused... traumatized. (baby crying) I got it. Sleep. I like to think that I'm a good man, Andrew. That I help people. (Evan over monitor): But sometimes life backs you into a corner, and you just don't have any choice. You know? (chuckles) No, you don't, do you, pal? Not yet. But no matter what, I love you. I'll do whatever it takes to keep us together. (door closing) (no dialogue) (intense music) (baby fussing, music stops) - He's hungry. Here you go. I think our Evan is in a tough spot, dear. Don't you? It wasn't easy for him as a boy. He was... different. But Evan was a good boy. And he's a good man. He learned the hard way that children need to be protected... that families need to be protected. But now you have a family of your own to protect. Sometimes... the cost of that protection... ... can be a little high. It must have been hard for you too, as a little girl with no family. I can't imagine what you went through. - It was horrible... the things I had to do. - Thank goodness Andrew will never have to go through that. We do everything we can for our sons. Don't we, dear? - Hi, sweetheart. - Hey, babe. Can you do me a favor? - Of course. - Can you watch Andrew after school? - Oh. Uh... - I need to get out of the house for a few hours. Go get my nails done, go to the grocery store-- I don't know. Anything that doesn't involve getting puked on. - Sure. Of course I'll watch him. - Thank you, sweetheart. I'll be home before bedtime. (deep breath) It's Lauren, Mrs. Cole. Hi. Listen, I heard what you said last night. I believe you. Um, I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Andrew, and I need to do something. Yes. Thank you. See you there. - Did Lauren leave already? - She said she was going shopping. - Yeah. She said she needed time. - And you believe her? - Lauren would never... She needs this family. - What about the boy? (Chris): Mrs. Cole? Do you really believe me? - He did it, Chris. But the thing that makes it so sad, is that he did it for you. I'm really sorry, Chris. (gunshot) - Lauren. (gasps) (news reporter): In a shocking suicide confession posted to Facebook late last night, Christopher Wells, honor student, just awarded a full scholarship to Stanford, has confessed to the three "Deadbeat Dad" murders uncovered here last week. The revelation has sent shockwaves through the community, (knocking) not only because of the brutality of the murders themselves, but because of the student's youth and academic promise. Fellow students are organizing a candlelight vigil, but sources say there are mixed feelings in the school halls. Detective John Overstreet... (Lauren): Hello, Detective. - You know, it's a different world. These kids put everything on the Internet. You have any idea how he could have gotten access to your files? - I let him get too close. Let him, uh, hang in my office when he was trying to get away from everything. Maybe I shouldn't have. - Well... with the, uh... confession and the, uh, suicide with the victim's own weapon, not much else to look into. And I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Cole. - Thank you, Detective. - Well, I will, uh... I'll show myself out. - Goodbye, Detective. Thank you so much for stopping by. Pancakes?
