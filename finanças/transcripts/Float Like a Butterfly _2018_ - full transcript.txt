That's it. The heavyweight champion of the world, Muhammad Ali, who used to be Cassius Clay, against the big, ugly Sonny Liston. Ha! Did he win? She did! Our own little Muhammad Ali is the new heavyweight champion of the world! One-two! One-two! A-one! Let ye get out of it. One-two! One-two! Duck! One-two! Watch out for Sonny Liston. Faster! One-two. One-two. And duck! One-two. One-two. Sonny's coming for ya. Punch Granny. Now would you leave the lackeen down, son? Francis, would ya get down, ya devil! Who's the greatest? Francis, who is the greatest? Look at me, Mammy! I am the greatest! Aren't I the greatest, Mammy? 'Course you are, sure aren't you your mammy's daughter. And you're the greatest, too, Patrick. That right, son? One-two. One. Huh, Patrick? One-two. Would ya leave the boy alone, Michael? Get us a sup of tea. This baby's awful thirsty. And, ah, what will you give me? Give him a song! That'll do him! Yeah, sing. Mammy'll sing. Watch. And I'll play me banjo. Watch. - Michael. - Don't mind the tae. Wet your throat with that. It'll do ya good. Do ya want me to sing or not? Come on, Mammy. Come on, Francis. Sit down. Come on. What do yiz want? Ah, me favorite. Shh! Whisht you! ¶ Oh, we are the travelling people ¶ ¶ Like the Picts or Beaker Folk ¶ ¶ The men in Whitehall think we're parasites ¶ ¶ But tinker is a word ¶ ¶ And with your gum, shellac, shalay, shala ¶ ¶ Move us on, ya boyoes ¶ ¶ Well, I have a little woman ¶ ¶ And a mother she is to be ¶ ¶ She gets her basket on her arm ¶ ¶ And she mooches the hills for me ¶ ¶ And with your gum, shellac, shalay, shala ¶ ¶ Wallop it out, ya boyoes ¶ ¶ Well, we've been married twenty year ¶ ¶ And nineteen children we have got ¶ ¶ Ah, sure when one is hardly walking ¶ ¶ The other is in the cot ¶ ¶ And with your gum, shellac, shalay, shala ¶ ¶ Move us on, ya boyoes ¶ That's a nice bit of singing, in fairness. Don't let us stop ye. Sorry, Sergeant. Show's over. Is there anything else ye came for, other then a bit of a sing-song? That child should be in school, not running around like a wild savage. You stop it, Francis. They're the cruelty men that take the bold children away. Don't mind him daughter. He has an inny in the toe. What did you say? Today's a holy day, Sergeant. There's no school on a holy day. What fucking holy day? The day Muhammad Ali punched a hole in Sonny Liston. That fucking holy day. Tell your son to mind his manners, Mr. Joyce. Show some respect for his betters. Pipe down, son. We don't want no trouble now. Come here to me, young madam. Now... tell me, do you go to school? She's only young yet, Sergeant. Younger then she looks. What age are you? - Nine. - Six. She was six, Sergeant. And one day, please God, she'll be nine. If I gave you four apples and took away two, how many would you have left? - Oh! - Sweet Jesus. Hold it, hold it, son. Leave my lackeen alone! Take your hands off her! Stay back! Get off me, ya fucking bitch! Hold it! Stop, son! You'll only make things worse! Mammy! Mammy. Francis, you're Mammy's little champion, aren't ya? - Get up, Mammy! - Calm down, ye! - Ye'll kill the man! - Go back inside, Patrick! Get out of my fucking way! Hold him! Hold the fucking knacker! You don't let anybody knock ya down, Francis. Keep your head up. - Margaret! - Get up! Daddy, help! Get up! Come on! Get up, ya fucking knacker! Ohh! Mammy, get up! Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Daddy! Francis! Daddy! Behind ya, Eamonn! It's your father! Hurry! Where do your think you're going? I asked you a question. It was Eamonn started it, Dada. The tinkers weren't doing anything. Only getting periwinkles. Get up to the car, you. Now! Apologize to my son for assaulting him. Apologize! Do you want to see your father rot in jail? Say sorry, Francis. Right. It's off to the fucking workhouse with the pair of ye. They'll beat the badness out of ye. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry, Sergeant." I'm sorry, Sergeant. 27, 28, 29... 30, 31, 32... What happened to ya, Francis? Is that all the winkles ya got, Patrick? What were ya up to, Francis? Stay here. Francis! Francis! Your granny is talking to you, Francis! 'Tis worse that one is getting. Get them wet things off ya, Patrick, before ya catch your death. Did ya fall in? They pushed us. Don't be petting. Don't be acting like a girl. Francis! Mammy's little champion. You don't let anybody knock ya down, Francis. I won't tell ya again, Francis! Punch! Faster! One-two! I speak out for what I believe, like you've got people in Ireland fighting for what they believe. Good man, Ali! Come on over to Ireland, put manners on the lot of them white divils. White divils! Do ya hear him? Sure, aren't ya a white divil yourself? We might look white on the outside, but inside the travelling people is the blacks of Ireland. Never has a slave got up and said, "I am the greatest. I cannot lose." Oi, did ya hear the news, Big Daddy? Ah, would ya whisht! What news? Step in by the fire and don't be standing there like a sergeant with a summons. Who you you like to see by the fire this time tomorrow, Patrick? - Elvis Presley. - Huh? I know. Muhammad Ali. Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali? Did ya hear them? You're nothing but traitors! Now what would your daddy say? Their daddy? That's right, sister, your Michael. What about our Michael? Out of jail? Haven't he a year to go? The judge said-- They must've needed a cell quickly. This time tomorrow, your daddy's going to be a free man. But he won't know me. Sure he won't. Of course he will. Your daddy never forgot his little man or his little woman! You're going to have to behave yourself, Francis, because it won't be easy on your daddy with your mammy gone. And your going to have to look after him until he gets his feet under him, do ya hear me? Isn't that right, Big Daddy? Your daddy won't be long, putting manners on ye! Isn't that right, Muhammad Ali? Yeah, Muhammad Ali, she says! And like I'm not only winning boxing. I'ma win also in the movement that I follow for my people. Ow! Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Thought it was a ghost. You're the walking shadow of your mammy, Lord have mercy on her. Who's that? Francis? That's never our Francis! I don't believe ya! You're codding me! Come here till I see the little changeling. Show me your muscles. Ah, that-a-girl. Now I knows ya. Stop that! Your daddy will chop of your fingers with a carving knife and throw them in there with the crubeens. - He wouldn't do that to us. - Oh, sure he would. He'd chop up the pair of us and eat us for breakfast. You know the one mistake I ever made, Francis? I should have skinned that snake whilst I had the chance. - The sergeant? - You whisht, you! With that foolish talk. Don't mind him, Francis. That's the whiskey talking. Better to die on your feet than live all your life on your knees. Am I right or am I wrong, Francis? You're right, Granddad. He'd be six foot under if it was up to me. Right. Bed with ye. Ah, but it's only early yet. Will ye go on? No back answering. Jesus. Don't destroy it. One-two, Francis. One-two! We are the greatest. We said it before we knew we was. ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ ¶ Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ ¶ Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile ¶ Oi, out, out! ¶ Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh ¶ ¶ Óró, sé do ¶ What the hell was that?

Did you eat a load of big red apples while I was away? Don't be talking nonsense, son. Your Margaret is dead and buried. You know that. Go inside, Francis. Don't be gawking at your daddy. Go on! Will you help me get him inside, lads? See? There. In the brown suit. That's our daddy. Daddy! Here he is. 'Tis your son. He's a free man at last. Huh. They didn't starve you anyways. No wonder you was in no hurry to get out. That's right. I was having the time of me life. Locked in a cage you wouldn't put a dog in. Here, son. Eat something and line the stomach. Ha! Line the stomach with that! Francis, give your daddy a kiss. Go on. Francis. You're after getting big. She was a good girl. She behaved herself lovely while ye were gone. She only beat a dozen or so heads. Show your daddy your muscles. Look at that. That's more than you had at her age. That's dangerous! You has to be finding her a husband quick, I'd say. Is that the way, huh? Christ. Want your daddy to get you a husband? I'd rather you brought me to see Muhammad Ali. You know he's fighting Blue Al in Dublin. Will you bring me? Do! Take her off to Dublin and throw her in the ring with himself. She'll give Ali a run for his money, so she will. Will you leave the man alone, and he only landed. You're still your daddy's girl, aren't ya, Francis? Good girl. Where's my little man? Let me look at him. Come here to me. What's that muck on your face? It's Smarties. He was eating Smarties. Smarties? From Rice Krispie buns & Ya clown, ya! Here, give him a guzzle of that. He's been too long on his granny's lap. Drink this up, son. Drink it up. Go on, go on. Sweet Jesus! He'll kill the child. He's fine. He's spilling more than he's swallowing. My son and heir, Patrick Joyce. Finished? Come on with me. Come on. Come on. Into the sea with ya. Go on. Keep scrubbing. What are you gawking at? Nothing. I was just seeing if you like... like butter. Do I like butter? Christ. Will you pass me my fags? They're in the jacket pocket. You weren't lonesome for me at all, I suppose. Hurry up, Francis! You'll be late for school. School? You're not going to no school today. Nor tomorrow neither. It's not every day your daddy comes home from jail. But Nana says that I-- Nana's not the boss of you anymore. I am. ¶ All those who died for liberty ¶ ¶ Have died but for a dream ¶ ¶ So then rise ¶ ¶ Rise ¶ ¶ Rise ¶ Go on, Mama. Go on! You never lost it, Mammy. I haven't the same wind I used to. She has so. I shared a bed with her last night. She had no shortage of wind then. You behave yourself, you. Francis, give us a song. Quick, before your granddad digs his own grave. No. I don't know no songs. Ah, you do. Sing the one your mammy used to sing ya. She has her mother's gift, son. Her mother's gift is right. And the temper of a red devil. - The banjo, huh? - No. - Come on, Michael. - No, no, no, no. - "P for Paddy." - Come on. ¶¶ ¶ P stands for Paddy, I suppose ¶ ¶ J for my love ¶ Papers. Sign that. What's wrong with ya? Can't you sign your own name? Make an X. Can you manage an X? We'll see you next week. Ooh! That's hers. Come on. Come on! Hit me. All right, come on. One-two. One-two. Mike, come on. Can I come too? How many times you have to be told, Francis? Why can't I not? Because! Please, Daddy. Daddy? We right? You're useless. What did you say? - What did you say? - Nothing. She said nothing. Right? She just wants to be with her daddy, that's all. Oh! Good enough for you? Feed her for me there. Make sure she finishes it all. If she had one of her own, that would keep her out of mischief. She has plenty of time yet. Plenty of time for what, causing trouble? Pow. Pow-pow. Whoo! Francis, nip to the shop. Get us a sup of milk and twenty Woodbines for your father. Quick, before he wakes. Get your filthy paws out of my sweets! How many of them do you want? Are you deaf or stupid? How many do you want? Get out. Get out, ya filthy thing! This girl was just on top of him, going up and down, up and down. They stayed nonstop. Watch where you're going, knacker! The tinkers are out robbing the place! Lock it up! Leave it. Leave it, I said! Go on, ya smelly tinker. Smell her, lads! Fucking waste! Rotten one. Grab hold of the thing. It wont bite you. Aah! Feels funny. You try again. Sit! Hold it. I'll do it. Like this. Ugh! Like that. Go away and wash yourself. Bang, bang, bang. There's only one thing would cure a temper like that. A match. What's going on? Nana? Hey, how do you likes your new home? That's Uncle Tommy's. She needs the outing, Francis. If she doesn't, she'll only get rusty. Pack up your things, Francis. We're going on the road. Are you not coming too, Granddad? Eh, we're too old for that racket. So only me and Patrick's going then? - Yup. - No. You can't just tear 'em out of school. We'll have social workers down on top of us, threatening to take 'em away from us. Childer nowadays has to get their education. They'll get their education on the road, same as ourselves. Daddy's right, Nana. School's no good. They don't teach us nothing. Only makes us sit in the back of the class and color in stupid pictures of their old houses. What about your parole? Haven't you to be here to show the sergeant your papers? Every week, they said. Hell with them and their papers. You a free man or not, son? Give me that. Light that, you. No flesh and blood of mine is going to no school what only learns 'em how to roll over and play dead. Here now. Let that keep you safe. Bend down to me here, Patrick. Here, son. You're nearly as handsome as meself. Be a good gossom, Patrick. Do ya hear me? Good gossom. Go on now. Be a good girl, Francis. Look after your daddy. And don't be giving him a hard time, do ya hear?

And where's your own husband? Is he gone off on ya? He is. Gone off to heaven for himself. So how much? By years, we go. He's five years old. We'll say five. Would you be interested in buying him? I think we could do business, all right. How much? I'd want to get thirty quid for this animal. Michael Joyce, the slayer of sergeants! What hole in the ground did you crawl out of? He don't recognize me without me teeth. Pa Quinn. Your mother's people and mine go way back. We go way back. I remember you when you were that size. You would run under the Shetland there and come out the far side without bending your knees. - Is that a fact? - 'Tis indeed. And who is this grand-looking lackeen here? My eldest, Francis, and my son, Patrick. Ah, the orphans. God love 'em. I bet you came to the fair looking for a husband, huh? I'm not looking for no husbands. All I wants to know is which road leads to Dublin. To Dublin. What would a slip of a girl like you be doing in that place? I'll go see Muhammad Ali knock the head off Blue Al, maybe pick up a trick or two. Behave yourself, Francis. Pajo. Pajo! Go find me grandson there. Tell him he's wanted. Pajo! Maybe pick up a trick or two, she says. You're some card. Here, go get yourself a drop of lemonade. And no baiting heads, no mind you. Hey, look what I got. Come on, let's go. I think I have the right fellow for that one. He'll knock the sparks out of her. Come here to me, young man. How would you like to get your picture taken with the greatest fighter this world has ever seen? Is that really him? Sure, of course it is. Don't you recognize the champion of the world when you see him? Have you a shilling for me, and you can give him a box. - You do it, Francis. - Do what? Miss, can my sister give him a box? If she has a shilling for me, she can do what she likes. Right. Up you pop. Hiya. That's not Muhammad Ali. Right, look at me. Look at the camera. Ugh! You're not Muhammad Ali!

Ah, Jesus. Have we no money left? We do. We've buckets of it. Anyway, what's the use in having money if you don't know how to spend it? True for ya. And when you get married, your husband will give ya a few bob if you behaves yourself. He's here! Pajo, you scoundrel. You're like Houdini escaping from me. Me grandson, Patrick Joseph Quinn II. And this is Michael Joyce, the man that as good as murdered a sergeant. I didn't tell ya a word of a lie. You'll get a great army of sons out of that one. Stand up straight, Francis. Let him have a good look at ya Up. Well? What's the verdict? Yeah. Yeah, what? Will she do you or not? She's all right. She's better than "all right", Pajo. My Francis could have the pick of any man. Right enough. There's no one saying any different. But there's not many young fellas going around on the finest stallion in the whole of Ireland. And he has a field of fine mares and foals as well, besides. Well, what you think yourself, Francis? Do you likes the look of him? - His hair. - What about it? It's stupid. She don't like your hair, Pajo. Would he be acceptable if he covered his head in a little cap maybe? Well, I don't like your hair neither. Looks like this fella's tail. - Yeah, well, I don't care. - I don't care more. Would ya listen to them, fighting like newlyweds already. Has we a match?

Tit, is it? Stick on some more tea, Irene. We could all do with a fresh drop. Put it on yourself. Fuck me. I've heard it all now. "Put it on yourself," she said. Top that you, good woman. He's had enough. What did you say? Don't you dare talk to your father like that. No, see, she gets the bad blood from yer side, so she does. - What? - No matter. She'll be getting married soon. Her husband will beat it out of her. If he hits me, I'll hit him back harder. I will. I'll knock his fecking-- Hello? Yeah, this is him you're talking to. Who? Oh. No, I have not seen the man. No, not for ten years or more. Will do, Sergeant. What did that bastard want? He said if you're not back by tomorrow, there'll be a warrant for your arrest. How does he even know they're here? Michael Joyce goes where he wants to go. And if and when I decide to go back, I'll put manners on him. I'll put manners on that son of his too. Shut up, you. Put manners on yourself. Patrick, come here to me, son. Come on, come here! Come on! Now tell that bastard you'll knock seven shades of shite out of his jumped-up monkey of a son. Open up your beak. Tell him! There's no one there. I'll fight the son, Daddy. I'm strong enough anyways. When are you gonna fucking learn, huh? When? Easy now. Everybody calm down now. This will all look different in the morning. Jesus! Run next door, Roseanne! Tell them to call the guards. Go and do as you're told, Roseanne! I'm sorry. I am. I didn't mean-- Get out of my house! Get out, the lot of ye! Savages! Sweet suffering Jesus, you put the heart across me. Where's Francis? Michael, where is the misfortunate lackeen? Son! Son! Talk to me, son. Mammy! Mammy! Mammy! Get up! Get up outta that grave! God forgive me for rearing a son that would abandon his own flesh and blood! What do you see? What is it, Mammy? Nothing. I see nothing anymore. Mister? What's wrong with you, creature? Are you lost or something? There it is. That's where she's sore. I know, darling, I know. Pajo! She's off to Dublin, she says. To see himself. You won't find Muhammad Ali in Dublin, child. But maybe this fellow could help you out. Ignore the bastard. - What did I just tell you? - I'll brain the bastard. - Now, Michael-- - Joe, I swear to God. I'll do jail twice over to wipe that grin off his puss. Well, more fool you, Michael. 'Cause if you get locked up this time, you're coming out in a box. Patrick! Get off of me! Fuck off. Go on, fuck off for yourself. Fuck off you too. Patrick! Are you ready to be a man for your daddy? Christ, you'll have no children left. What'd you say? Your Patrick against that sergeant's son? It's not a fair match. He's twice the size of him! Or is it you want to get the whole lot of them murdered? Who's this boy's father, me or you? I looked after him when you weren't around. He was one of me own. And a good job you did too. He's as much of a coward as you are. Now, Patrick, you listen to me. It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down. It's how many times you get back up is what counts, right? That's a proper tinker punch, isn't it? Get up! Stay down, son. There's no shame in losing an unfair fight. Stay down! Get up. If he don't kill ya, I will. Let your hands go. Use your flaming fists! Come on away with me, Patrick. We'll fix you up. Let me fight! Stop! Let me finish it, Daddy! Go on home to Granny. Go on! Get out of here! Do you want to end up like your mother before you? You can live all your life on your knees if you want. But I can't. And I won't. Michael, let her fight. Let her do what she was born to do. Oi! Do you have gloves for that one? Someone get gloves for my son so he doesn't dirty his fucking hands. For the love of Jesus! What happened to him? Our Francis is back. There's gonna be blue murder. One-two. One-two, three-four. Come on! Come on, Eamonn! Go on there! Come on, Francis. Fight! Come on! Come on, Eamonn! Good girl, Francis! Keep the hands up, Francis! Come on! Good girl, Francis! Good girl! Come on, you're better than this! He's getting beat by a girl, are ya! He's getting beat by a little girl. Come on, Francis! Get in there, will ya? - Ah, Jesus! Get up! - Think Ali! One-two! Hands up. Come on, Francis! - Good girl, Francis! - Get up! Come on, Francis! Francis! - That's it! - Get up, Francis! Get off her! Get off her, ya savage! Come away, loveen. This isn't your fight. Big Mammy's right, Francis. Turn the other cheek. The likes of him isn't worth it. How many cheeks does a person have to turn? Would you look at her? Jesus, her mammy in heaven protect ya. Take her away, son, before it's too late. Don't! She'll hurt worse if she don't fight. Am I right? Is this your idea of law and order, setting a child against a child? Well, you're a disgrace! The lot of ye! You're worse than animals! Was it not enough for ye that ye killed this child's mother? Yeah, well, the only good knacker is a dead knacker! Dead! - Go on, Francis! - Go, Francis. Again! - Come on! - Get up, I said! Francis. You're Mammy's little champion, aren't ya? One-two, one-two. Rise, Francis. Keep your head up. Rise. One-two. One-two! You don't let anybody knock you down. Our own little Muhammad Ali is the new heavyweight champion of the world! Yay! Who is the greatest? Francis, who is the greatest? Look at me, Mammy! I'm the greatest! Enough, Francis. Let that be an end to it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Yeah! Well done! More power to ya, Francis! She nailed him in fairness! Yes, she did. She put manners on him. Fair dues to ya. Muhammad Ali himself wouldn't best you. Ain't that right, son? Your lackeen done us proud! - Stay away from me! - Come away, loveen. Your daddy doesn't know what's good for him anymore. Get away from me, I said! I won! I showed him I was the greatest! And you've said it before. Remember? Mammy said it too. Say it. Will you say it?! You did your mammy proud. Fucking, fucking inbreds. You're the greatest daughter! You're the fucking greatest! Whoo! Here, get that into you. Away with ye! Go on! Get outta there. Let the champion rest. You be learning your books now, Patrick? Yes. Hello, Francis. - Hiya. - Got a puppy. Uncle Tommy got him for me. - Hey. - Hiya, puppy. Show us your muscles. That's the grandest muscle in all of Ireland. Behave yourselves, ye. Good job you never made it to Dublin, Francis.
