In last night? dreams... Is that you, Haruo? Is that you, Haruo? No one's here. Are you su re? How much did I tell you? Why don't you introduce him to me? So I went. It's a big world, but it seems so small sometimes. The boss is Naruto. Do you know him? I used to go drinking with him all the time. I might know him if I saw him. I'm sure you would. He ended up inviting me to go out with him. Is that so? That's good. Hmm. Do you think so? Well, I guess I have to play along sometimes. But all I do is cause you trouble. Don't worry about me, but... I just feel sorry for your wife and son. Don't worry about her. It's just the kid. That goes for me, too. You do sacrifice for your kids, don't you. Speaking of kids, where's Haruo? How's Sachiko? - You mean the Madame? - That's right. Just fine. That must be because she's a real go-getter. Tell her I said hello. Tell her I'll come see her soon. What are you going to say to her? Didn't I just tell you? I'm going to talk to her about the rough time I'm having. And I'm going to leave two bottles there. Do you think she'd make a good wife? I'm sure. I'd give her my seal of approval. I don't think I have much faith in your seal of approval. Could you do this up for me? Is that OK? Tighter? That's fine. I should be going. Have some rice before you go. I can't stay. I have to start working tomorrow. Well, work hard. Yes. Please. I need to get new shoes, but I never get around to buying them. I gotta go. Bye . What? Did you forget something? I'm sorry, but could I have some? Have some what? Two or three hundred yen, so I can go out. Won't they give you any? They will, but they take it out of my pay later. This is all I have. You'll have to excuse me. I'm very sorry about asking you all the time. See you later. Yuki-san, did he ask you for money? Yes. You have to be firm. Just because he helped you out once in the past doesn't mean anything now. You're right. Men who can't provide for you are the worst. Like mine. Did he go to the bicycle races again today? Well, of course. He goes every day. I'm going to have to give it to him good. What are you looking at, Haruo? That boat goes all the way to Odaiba. He's going to the Ameichi. - Have you ever been there? - No. Is that right? - I'll have to take you there someday. - Really? For sure! Ah, rats! I was going to give you your allowance. Buy me something and keep the change. I see. If I buy you something, I can keep the change! Clever! Wow! So you do win sometimes. Well, well, well. It's all what you've got upstairs. What are you saying? You lost until now. You lose some to win some. You don't understand. You wanted some port, didn't you? Are you going to get me some? I'm going. See you later. Mom! Look! Ah, what's that? Mr. Fujimura bought it for me. He did? He had two hundred yen. Don't worry about how much money people have. Go eat and get to bed early tonight. OK? See you later! - Take care. - Bye! - Yumi, can I have a moment? - What is it? What did he say? He'll be waiting for us at the usual place. You and me? He wants you to bring Kyoko. Is that so? Don't let Yukiko know. Don't worry. You live in Ishikawa.You can get home before the last train. Come on. But what will Yukiko say? You're 20. You're an adult now. You don't have to listen to her. Kyoko, they need a beer over here. Yes. I don't want you tempting Kyoko. That's not what I'm doing. - How old are you? - Eight. Eight? You're really something for eight! That's enough. It's late. Get home soon. What's that? That's the boy. Poor kid. It's kind of sad, isn't it? That's rig ht. He does everything himself. He's a good kid. She should find a regular job. She's a girl's school graduate. She could do it. That's right. That's what I tell her. But what about you? - What? You mean the Fukui job? - Yes. No way. I can't work with that parvenu sushi maker. I'm a big deal in Tsukiji. Hello, Bar Bel Ami. Who? I see. No, not at all. Just a moment. - It's from your husband. - Excuse me. We're going to be shooting all night tonight. We're really busy. I won't be able to go home tonight. Bye. Omura-san! On the set, pronto! - Your husband? - No, it was from my little brother. Your brother lives with you? He works for the newspaper. He's busy and can't make it home tonight. Newspaper? Which one? You know, the Morning News. I work for the Daily News. Really? Well, that's a bad mix. - I'm back. - Welcome. Hi there. Has it been busy? Since seven. Did it clear up? Yes. Plays are annoying that way. By the way, I met Shizue. With Kasai? Yes, her usual accompaniment. How old is she now? I don't know. I think she's in her early fifties. That makes her a couple years older than you. She seems younger. She always did look young for her age. She said she'd really like to meet you. Oh? Why don't we close now? Well, shall we be going? Will you add up the bill? You really don't have any money? Like I told you, I was waiting for a friend but he didn't show up. That's why I'm asking you to lend me some until tomorrow. Can't you understand that? But that's a lot of trouble for us, you know. It's late. Where's Kyoko? - She couldn't come. - Yukiko is so strict. Why? Because her customer didn't pay his tab. What's going to happen? Does Kyoko have to pay for it? - Well, who's fault is it? - That's too bad. Well, there's not much we can do about it now. Let's live it up tonight. Just a minute. My friend said he would be here soon. I thought I'd go in there and wait for him. Shall we go in and wait? Really? Ah, forget it. Straighten up. Come on. This is yours, right? Take it with you. Not there, this way. What will it be? Hunh? You're going to drink something? You have to order something. Don't worry, I have money. Really? This is getting worse and worse. Sorry. Well, then I'll have a shochu. How about you? Me. Hmm, I'll have a beer. She'll have a beer and I'll have a shochi'l. Excuse me. May I have one? Hey, where's your friend? I know it's late, but he'll come. Are you sure? Don't worry. I've caused you a lot of trouble. It's really terrible of me. Excuse me. Hey! Where are you going? WC. - Does that guy come here often? - No. Well, then does his friend? I don't know. That's the first time I ever saw him. What's up? He ran out and left me with the tab. Don't worry. I'll pay. Welcome home. Oh, you're still awake? You should have gone to bed. How was it? A guy ran out on me. I should have noticed, but I wasn't paying attention. Then I went drinking. What should we do about the money? Never mind. It's only 3,000 yen. I'll just add it to my tab. But that's... Never mind. Just do what I say. Do you understand? Yes. It's already one. Let's go to bed. After I send Haruo to school, I feel exhausted. It's tough, I know. But as kids go, he's pretty easy. That's true. My little brother is really something. He argues with Mother and doesn't listen at all. How's your father? Is he any better? Yes. We're trying to get him into a nursing home, but they're all full. You get better if you eat well and rest. It's hard work, but you have to do your best. Do you understand? Yes. The one thing I have is my health. I'm not just talking about getting sick. It's everything. Have you made any progress with... you know? I told Mother what you said. She said she couldn't add anything to it. She said that a guy who has nothing but money is no good. I don't want to be a widow. That's right. You have to look long and hard for a good one. It's your first time. I'm sorry for lecturing you. That's right, you have to look for a good guy. Watch out for the guys who come to the bar. I've been burned that way myself. Haruo's father? That's right. He seemed nice and he said all the right things. I was completely in love with him. I wanted him to marry me. I gave him my all. But when I got pregnant with Haruo. he turned cold and threw me out, just like that. If you think of men as beasts, you won't be too far off. Men really get it from you, don't they? Yeah, well, who among my friends is happy? What about Toshiko? Yeah. She's married to him. They have kids, and he's a serious guy. They could do with a bit more money, though. It's hard, isn't it? You bet. It's harder than winning a million yen in the lottery. Let's clean up a bit, shall we? Where's Shizue living these days? Near Shibuya. They say she's doing well. I think I'll go borrow some of her good luck. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where are you going? - I'm going to Shizue's place. - Say Hello for me. - Bye. - Be good, kid. See you. Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Yes. Who's there? Oh, it's you, Yu-chan. Come in. Are you sure it's OK? Yes it's fine. This is a nice place. Not really. We're here until Kasai gets a new place in Kansai at the end of the year. It's been a while, hasn't it? I should have got in touch earlier. I should have contacted you, too. - I heard that you went to a play. - With one of Kasai's friends, yes. Is Kasai always here these days? He spends half the month in Osaka, and the other half here. Weren't you supposed to meet Takeuchi at eleven? I know, I know. Hello there. It's been a while. You seem to be doing well, as usual. Got a little older. Would you like to sit on an old guy's lap? I see you haven't lost your sense of humour. I see you remember that I had one. By the way, how's Fujimura? Why are you bringing him up? There's nothing between them. I know, but I hear he goes to her house once in a while. That guy's a sad case. At one time he was doing really well. I remember back in '42 or '43 he would come in every night, leave 100 yen tips. Back then, that was a lot of money. I saw him once after the war. He looked like a military guy. He had a hard time adjusting after the war. He's never had a bad thought in his life. I know, but if you can't do anything a bad... Oh, I have to go. Takeuchi will be waiting. That's right. I've been bugging you about it all morning. - Well take your time, Yuki-san. - See you. Excuse me for a moment. Come on, fix your tie. You look like a slob. Cut that out. About what Kano asked the other day... - About Yukiko? - Yes. You know, meeting her. Ask her about it. Alright, see you. - Sorry, I'll get you some coffee. - Please don't worry about me. - You two look like you're getting along. - For now anyway. Too easy to say that. You don't seem to like him that much. He takes care of me. That's why I'm here. He pays the bills and I can shop. I like that. - Is that right? - Yes, it is. You're really smart. I admire you. I don't think so. Was that a backhanded compliment? No, you are smart. During the war, you got out of the city fast. That's how you were able to make it through the war without trouble. Now you're back and you've got this place. You always seem to make the right move. I don't know if I'm being praised or criticised. But you know, I don't think what I'm doing is wrong. Whatever you say, a woman is a woman. If you want to be someone's legal wife your whole life, it might be different. Whatever I do, I have to first take care of the money angle. Then I can do what I want. And then? Whether it's a man or something else, I can do what I want. Right? But first, I need some cash. You know, there's a guy I really like. Would you take care of him for me? Don't tease me! I'm serious. He does business with Kasai. He's been to the Bel Ami a few times. You know, the guy who has a big mole on his nose. Ah, I know. It's Kano, right? That's right, Kano-san. They say he's doing really well. He makes a lot of money, so he's kind of cheap. Want to squeeze some out of him? What do you think? Think it over. Well, I'll think about it. What? Still feeling indebted to Fujimura? It's not that. The reason I left him wasn't because I was his mistress I was thinking about Haruo. I also thought of his wife and kids. - I thought about a lot of stuff. - So why do you lie about it? I can't help it. You know why. I can't forget how he helped me out when I was in the hospital dying. I just can't forget what I owe him for that So you do feel indebted to him after all. I think you're a good person. I really do. Don't imitate me, especially when you think I'm being silly. Oh my, it looks like it's raining. I guess the heavens don't want you to go. Will you stay a while? It's no good if you're so self-conscious! - Sorry. - That's just the boy going out. - Sorry. Yuki-san must be caught in this rain. Yes, she probably is. If I'd known about it, I'd have brought an umbrella for her. What? Let's do it once more. I'm here to check the gas meter. What can I get you? - Buckwheat noodles. - Coming right up. Ah, I'm bushed. I hardly slept last night. Where were you? Sorry I'm late. Still no one here? - Is it still raining? - Yes. - You must have gotten wet. - I borrowed an umbrella from Shizue. I tried to leave, but she just wouldn't let me. - How is Shizue? - Great. - Oh that's right, Mama called. - For me? She said she wanted to meet you at the Tokai at ten. - Does that mean she's not coming in? - She said it was important. I wonder what it could be? Don't you know? You sure take things easy. - She's going to sell this place. - Really? Would I lie to you? Can't she make it? It must be tough on Mama. The customers don't come, and no one wants to rent this place out, either. Her problem is that she's old-fashioned. Look at how they do it at Nomura and the Black Cassovar. Young guys won't come unless it's a place like that. You'd be fine Akemi. You're young and single. You could work anywhere if this place went under. Yuki and I would be the one's left out in the cold. Right? We can't escape our age. There isn't anyone here. - Let's go. - Yeah. Sorry to keep you waiting. Yuki, there's someone waiting for you outside. Who is it? - Sorry about this. - It's fine. - What will it be? - I'll have whatever you're having. - Is chow mein alright? - Yes. - Two Chow Meins, please. - Sure. How was it tonight? Slow? Yes. There was a group with Ka-san and another with me. There was a newcomer tonight. He's a little [crazy]. He takes lessons from the singing teacher downstairs. He's awful! He was singing recklessly. He got into ?Tales of Narashino?. - He sang that? - I wouldn't call it singing. He started with ?The old man from Echigo?. ?The green of pines?, ?Tsurukame?, ?The Shrine in Spring? .... Then he got drunk and sang even more. It was quite painful to hear! I know what you mean! - Look at that. - What? Be good. I'll be back soon. Please take care of her. It's pathetic. She's here to bring in customers. Is it true that they're going to sell the place? That's why I wanted to talk to you. Do you know someone who can lend me 200,000 yen? Hmm... Maybe you could find someone with money and hang out with him for a while. This is a big headache. Help me out. - You need 200,000 yen? - Yes. Hello, is this the Kano Trading Company? Is the President in? I'm returning his call. He went out? How long ago was that? A few minutes ago? Never mind then. Hello. I just called your office. Sorry. Whether the President himself works makes a big difference in how hard the employees work. Sorry to bother you at a busy time. Don't worry about it. Truthfully, since I hadn't gotten a reply from Kasai about you I had actually given up on you. But where shall we go? Is there someplace quiet nearby? Don't you live around here? Yes, but my son is home now. Oh, your son. You have a son, that's right. Hmm, an hourly hotel? Those places just want to take your money. A cafe would be just fine. What I have to say isn't that complicated. Complicated or not, a cafe wouldn't be right. Oh, I know a good place. It's good and it doesn't cost anything. It's close, so we can walk. Why, hello there. Hey there. We're going to use the warehouse. If someone asks for me, give me a yell. Would you like some tea? You don't have to run away. I'll take care of you. Here's 5,000 yen for starters. - I don't need that. - Don't turn it down. I worked hard for that. I don't need it! My sweetheart. So you tell me 'no' with your hand, too. I was trying to be kind. I worked hard for that money. The 200,000 yen you asked for is the same money, isn't it? People call me cheap, but I always take care of people. I want you to know that. Don't misjudge me. I'm not that kind of woman! I'm leaving! Come on. We just got here. Relax. I'm warning you. If you do this, it'll reflect poorly on your character. Character? Who cares?! I told you no! Haruo, do you want to go to the bath with Grandpa? Sure! - Is he coming? - Yes. Money? What? You don't even have enough to go to the bath? I have some money. That's ok, Haruo. Grandpa, here, is a slob who's always losing his money. He should put it away like I do. Yukiko, Mr. Shirai is waiting for you. Please come in. I came to apologize for getting drunk the other night. Ah, there's no need for an apology. Would you like to request a song? I'm fine, thanks. Sing the song you did last night. "The old man from Echigo." I could do it if it's OK with Yukiko. May I? Sure. Sing it for us. Do you know ?The old man from Echigo?? The ballad? Don't worry about how you play it. Sure, we can play that. I'll follow your lead. Once more. Ballads are no good without a shamisen. Right? That's rig ht. Once more. Where's Yumi? She's not here yet. Is she somewhere else? She'll be here later. It's still early. Tell her I was looking for her. Don't sing if you can't sing. You'll ruin this place. Who's that guy? - Is he a gangster? - Yeah, sort of. If you don't watch out, the same thing will happen to you. Hey, don't stop in the middle. Sing the rest. No. Just as I was getting the rhythm that guy came in and ruined the mood. Play something else. Here's "Memories." Mom says that if you're honest, serious and cheerful, any job is OK. That's right. Honest, serious and cheerful. She says any job is OK. That's rig ht. But I want to be a scientist. A scientist? I want to win the Nobel Prize. Nobel Prize... That would be nice. I couldn't even win the Drinkin' Prize. What's that? The Drinkin' Liquor prize. That's silly. "Fujimura Poetry Collection" Is this Mr. Fujimura's? No, it belongs to mother. Is that right? I didn't know Mr. Fujimura wrote poetry. I'm going to borrow this. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. Wow. You work hard in the morning. Hey look. This bell is really something. I got it from Ouchi-san. You can't open it like this. And if a burglar lifts it like this... - That is something! - It sure is. Maybe I should get one. I'll ask him to save one for you - Is Yukiko in? - She sure is. Go on in. Hello. Ah, good morning. Come in. - Kasai came home right after that. - Did he? I heard you met Kano the other day. Sorry I didn't say anything about it. I don't care about that. You should have heard him last night. He was really mad. I heard about the warehouse. - He was disgusting. - That's the way it goes. But what were you thinking? Asking him for 200,000 yen! Mama asked me. I'm not going to do things like that for people again, though. You shouldn't stop. It's your fault. I'm not going to fall for that. You're after something, aren't you? That's rig ht. The answer is no. I won't do it. Don't say that. I can't ask anyone else. I'll give you a bit of money. I'd do anything for you. What is it? He's coming. My true love. My true lover is coming to Tokyo. What do you mean 'true lover'? My true lover! What do you think it means? I want to hold his hand, talk to him, play cards with him... You? Don't make a face like that. Sometimes even I want to have a love like that. Even though he's not that interested... Who is it? Ishikawa Kyosuke. He's the second son of a big land owner in the town where I was during the war. I see. He's still single. He works at a weather station. He's obedient and childish. I call him "The Kid". The war ended a long time ago. Does Kasai know about him? Of course not. Kasai gets really jealous. That's why I'm asking you. Kasai will leave on business the day after tomorrow. Why do you have to worry? No, you're wrong. Kasai gets really jealous. That's why I'm asking you. Kasai is leaving for Osaka the day after tomorrow. Until then, show "The Kid" the sights. Me? I don't want to. Come on. Don't be so cold. Show him around town. It's just two days. Oh, no. I have to go. I promised to meet him at Ueno Station at 10:00. I have to go. He's waiting at the Tsutaya in Tomicho. It's no use. I'll give you 500 yen for your trouble. Just keep quiet about us. He thinks I'm a war widow. That's what I've told him, and he believes me. That's awful. Well, I'll be really indebted to you. Excuse me. We are late. Allow me to introduce my friend Yukiko Fuji. She lost her husband. She's teaching piano now. How do you do? I'm Ishikawa Kyosuke. Kid Oops, sorry. 'Kid' is fine. Alright. I know I promised to show you around town, but you came at a bad time. It's OK. I have to go to the war widow's club today and tomorrow. I'm sorry. So I've asked Yukiko to take care of you. Thank you very much. She graduated from a women's college, so she can keep up with you. Well, excuse me, I have to be going. Please take care of him, Yukiko. Wait! - You really lay it on thick. - Don't worry. He doesn't care. But please act sophisticated. - He doesn't like vulgarity. - Whatever. It's just for these two days. I really appreciate it. He's my Kid. And if he asks about anything, tell him you don't know. Ridiculous. What would you like? I'll have to ask him first. This area is called the Sanjukenbori. There are a lot of bars, cafes and shops around here. Is that so? - This is Miharabashi? - Yes. What's that building? - That's going to be a public bath. - A bath? Wow. Come, let's go. Yes. This is Ginza Dori. It's eight blocks from Kyobashi to Shinbashi. Until recently, there were stalls on both sides of the street. It sure is crowded. Isn't the Ginza pretty at night? So many bars here. - You like to drink? - No, I don't drink at all. Bel Ami? That sounds familiar... Oh, that's right, it's a Maupassant story. Do you like Maupassant? Yes. Very much. Is that right? Hi! He seems like a musician. Do you know him? It's not too interesting around here. Shall we go? - Thief! - Thief? That hurts. Not so rough. I won't run. Sorry. What I did wasn't so bad. I was drunk and it was a small thing. Please forgive me. Alright. It's alright. As a form of apology, I was walking around with this in case I met you. I was too embarrassed to give it to you. - Will this do? - Yes. - Was anything else taken? - No. Taken?! I'm not really a thief! But he called me a thief. - All I did was go to her place... - I know, I know. Let's go. Wait you! Just a moment! You called me a thief, and that might cause people here to misunderstand. Listen everyone, this guy here... I know. But I don't. In the Ginza... He seems a little strange in the head. Hey you! Wait! Wait! Thief! Ahh, that feels good! Why don't you go in? No thanks. You must be tired! Yes, all those people, cars and trains going by. But why do they all come to the Ginza? Seems strange to me. That's for sure. They must not have anything better to do. Yes, of course. Some people say that they can't sleep unless they go there every night. Is that right? I think I'd curl up and die if I had to live in the Ginza. What about you? How would you do? Me? It's not for me, either. - Here you go. - Thanks. What do you think of this place? It's pretty close to the Ginza. It's nice. Quiet here. Shizue chose this place. She's nice, isn't she? Yes, she is. For a widow, she's pretty cheerful, isn't she? But there's something about her I don't understand. She seems to be hiding something. What do you think, as her friend? Shizue is not someone who lies or hides things. Actually, she's quite talkative, isn't she? Excuse me. Do you want one? No, thank you. The stars sure are pretty. Do you know the stars well? Not really. I only know the Little Dipper and that's it. - Would you show me some? - Sure. You can see the Little Dipper pretty well tonight. Where is it? See? Right over there. Ah, now I see it. There's a poem called "Make me your North Star". That's right. Do you know the rest? ?Make me your North Star, I won't waver in a thousand years.? ?The day your heart flows over? ?The bottom points to the East, the top to the West? Do you like poetry? Yes. I used to read quite a bit of it. But these past ten years, I've been too busy. I should, though. I disagree. The busier you are, the more you need poetry. - That's what I think. - Yes. But excuse me. That one's a little strange for you. "At the base of the apple tree... "... a single flower blooms..." Hey you, shouldn't you be sleeping? You've got school tomorrow. Tomorrow is Sunday. Oh, that's rig ht. Mom's taking me to the zoo. Sounds nice. Can I come too? That's fine. Mom's home. Did Haruo go to bed? I'm asleep! You have to get to bed earlier. Mom, we're going to the zoo tomorrow, right? Yes. That's great! Well, good night. Good night. Did they say something at the bar? Everyone wondered where you were. It's unusual for you to miss a day. Shizue asked me to show her friend from the countryside around town. Mama told me to say hello. And to let you know that she found someone to lend her the 200,000 yen. Really? That's good. The place won't go under for now. Toshiko was really relieved. But Kyoko, you can't be a bar maid forever. Once you hit 40, you really can't do it. You have to find someone good and get married. Be a good wife. But it's hard to find someone good. I heard what you said. You can't trust the guys that are sweet in the beginning. Someone with no wife, practical... Does anyone like that really exist? Sure they do. It's too early for you to give up. Well then, where are they? You have to go and find them. You find them in the strangest places. What would you do if you found that perfect one? Marry them? Certainly! I'd drop all of this in a second. But... What if it didn't work out? It'd be even worse then. You must have confidence to make it work. Yukiko, you're really sure of yourself today. Am I? Kyoko, do you know Andromeda? I don't. How about Casseopia? Are those bars? They're constellations. Oh yeah? I only know the Little Dipper. You should learn the stars. ?Make me your North Star. I won't waver in a thousand years.? - What's that? A poem? - Yes A man who will stand by your side for a thousand years. What are you thinking? Laughing like that. Yes. Let's go to bed. I did a lot of walking today and I'm tired. Are you still crying? Stop that. Mother lied to me. She promised to take me to the zoo. Your mother has things to do. Stop crying. Here. Take this and go play. I think we've seen most of this. I guess there are some nice things here. Is the Exhibition Hall in the Gaien far from here? Yes, it's a bit far. Why? Do you want to go there? I'd like to, if we can. Where is Mitaka? Mitaka? Why do you want to go there? There's an observatory there. I want to see lots of things before I leave tomorrow morning. That's pretty soon. I thought you were leaving later than that. That was my plan, but I have to go back right away. I got a telegraph. Oh. Yo-chan, it's time to eat. I'm going to go eat. Lots of people with children here. There must be a zoo nearby. Yes, probably. The zoo. Kids love that. Do you have children? Huh? Yes, one. A boy. So you probably go to the zoo often. Yes. Where shall we go next? Yes, where shall we go... Hey Kid, no school today? Nope. After you've rested, let's go out again. Where? To the Shinbashi Theatre. Shizue got us tickets. Is that right? You don't sound too excited. You're probably tired and want to go home. You're right. I know how rude this sounds, but I'm no good in those kind of places. Oh my. So Ginza would be even worse, then. Maybe there's too much stimulation, but I feel like a zombie there. But not everyone is there because they want to be. You told me last night, didn't you? How many stars can you see with just your eyes? About 6,000. Only 6,000? But if you look through a telescope, you can see 100 million. But the ones you see in a telescope are mostly the faint ones, right? That's rig ht. Ginza is the same. You see the bright lights there, but they just hide the faint stars of Ginza. You have to talk about that. You might be right. - We're getting too abstract here. - Not at all. Ishikawa-san, do you like children? Children? Why? I really like them. Enough to get a wife. Then why don't you get married? No special reason. Never had the chance. You have to make the opportunities yourself! When you do get married, you don't want someone who's already been married before, do you? No, not really. Why should that make a difference? As long as you like each other. I think, anyways. Really? Is that what you really think? Excuse me! - Is Miss Fuji here? - That would be me. A member of your family is here to see you. Haruo is - What's going on? - What is it? - It's Haruo. I can't find him! I've looked everywhere. I'll go look for him. Will you go to Shinbashi with Ishikawa? We have tickets. But ...... Don't worry. He's a good person. But if he asks about Shizue or me, just tell him "I don't know" or "I haven't heard." - Is something wrong? - Nothing. Nothing at all. This is my younger sister, Kyoko. I have an errand to do. Will you go to the theater with her? Then, I'll be on my way. I'll leave it to you. Please, have a seat. Or shall we go out? I haven't seen him anywhere. Where could he have gone? This is trouble. Oh, here she is. Sorry. What can we do? Still no sign of him. Could he have gone and looked at the elephants? How could he have done that? Don't be so silly. Anyhow, I'm going to go look for him. Let me take your things. I'll look around here. What's going on? You looking for someone? Haruo went out this morning and hasn't come back yet. We haven't seen him. - Why don't you help look? - Yes. Excuse me. How was it? Did you find anything? I checked your fortune. It says to look in this direction over here. Did anyone look near the river around Tsukishima? Hey, a kid fell in the river! Where? Quick! Let's go and look. What was it? - The kid's alright, it wasn't Haruo. - I see. Should we report him missing to the police? That might be a good idea. I'll go right now. - I'll go. - No, I'll do it. Sorry to bother you. Why don't you take a rest? He's here! Haruo's here! Thank goodness! Where were you? You sure caused a big commotion! Mom, look at what I got! Stupid! Where were you? You might have been kidnapped or something. I worried and worried about you. You should really think of your mother once in a while. Mr. Fujimura gave me a ride. Why didn't you tell someone? That was stupid! Stupid! Come now. Come on. Sorry. Everything's fine. But there are lots of stories about the stars in the Greek myths. Do you know the one about Andromeda and Cassopeia? No, I don't. You know this one, right? The North Star. Yes, I do. You finally said it. Said what? Up to now, you've been saying "I don't know" or "I have no idea" to everything. But I didn't know. The stars are pretty - especially where I'm from. I'd like to show you sometime. Come visit. Would you take me? Really? But it'd be a lot of trouble for you. Why is that? People are so nosy in the country, and you're going to get married. I don't mind. I think it would be more trouble for you. No, it wouldn't. That one is the North Star, isn't it? That's right. That one. Yuki-chan, do you mind if I go to sleep? That's fine. Kyoko must have gone home to Ichikawa. I see. Good night. Good night. It's early for you, isn't it. You're right, but I'm too late. What? The Kid left. He took the first train this morning. Oh my. There's something that's even more surprisng. We'll talk on the way. What was it that was so surprising? Some young girl went with him to Ueno station. She was a maid or a bar girl. Seems they spent the night together. That can't be right. Surprising isn't it? I didn't think the Kid had it in him, but he's a man after all, I guess. I shouldn't have made him my True Love. But who do you suppose this girl was? Do you have any idea? I don't know. Men sure give you grief, don't they? So that's it for my True Love. Are you doing anything tonight? Kasai went back to Osaka last night. I'll take a rain check. I didn't sleep well last night and I have a headache. OK, I'll be in touch. - Sorry. - See you later. Good morning. Yukiko. What's wrong? I should have told you that Mr. Ishikawa was leaving. Kyoko, where were you last night? I was going to sleep here, but it was so late that I... It was so late, that what? It was so late, that what? What happened? That he asked me to stay with him. I misjudged you. You're no different from Akemi and Yumi. I didn't think you were that kind of person. But all I did was stay there. Nothing happened. Do you think I can believe that? Mr. Ishikawa's not like that. Just like you told me, I answered all his questions with ?I don't know? but I didn't want to lie to him. He's such a good guy. I told him the truth. I see. Sorry. You don't have to apologise to me. Do you like Ishikawa, Kyoko? He's a good one. He says he's going to come and see me sometime soon. He promised you that? I see. But to tell you the truth, I'm a bit surprised. You falling in love with the first guy you meet and promising to marry him. But I was being serious, just like you always tell me to be. Don't worry. I'm happy for you, if you can find someone good to marry. What's with the tears? Silly. Where do you suppose his train is now? Hey Mister, what time is it? The guy downstairs is funny, isn't he? As soon as he saw my face, he told me that he had no idea that I wrote poetry. At first I didn't know what he was talking about, but I got it later. It seems he saw one of Toson's poetry collections and read it as ?Fujimura.? What do you want? Nothing special. Have you come for more money? No, I'm not going to ask you for money so often. How's business going? Well... I want you to work hard. I've decided going to work hard too. I've only got Haruo now. That's rig ht. Haruo will be in middle school next year. - Well, I'll be seeing you. - Goodbye. Hey, Uncle Fujimura! Hey Kid. See you next time. Mom, are you leaving? I'm going out. If you're good, I'll take you to the zoo next Sunday. Really? Promise? Yes. Ok, be good. Spring comes! Spring comes! Where is it? It comes to the mountain, to the village, it comes to the forest.
