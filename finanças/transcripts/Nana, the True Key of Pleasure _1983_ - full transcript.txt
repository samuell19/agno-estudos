(lion roars) (relaxed music) (men chattering) - What the hell is going on here? Get them out! Out you pigs! I won't tolerate filth, this is a respectable house! Out, out, do you hear what I say? Out! Go on, Go on! Out, out! Move, move! Oh, Monsieur Steiner! Oh welcome, welcome. A pleasure to see you again. - (speaks in foreign language) Monsieur Fontan. I hope you have a very good table for me tonight. I have with me a very important guest. (laughs) - Oh, oh, Monsieur Faucherie! The famous journalist of Le Figaro. (laughs) Oh, you'll not be sorry. You'll not be sorry you ventured out in this awful weather. I have a surprise for you tonight. - What is it? - Marvelous George Mellies. - Who? - The magician. Oh, this might be good. - With his moving photographs, and his beautiful assistant, Diana. She'll raise more than your eyebrows, gentlemen. Come, come! (laughs) - Yes I know, I see something special. The whole of Paris is talking about it. (upbeat music) - With my compliments. Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves. - Hector? Hector! Why are you hiding there in the corner? Come join us. - (speaks in foreign language), monsieur Steiner. - Good evening. May I introduce you to young Hector Muffat de Beauville, son of my good friend, Count Muffat. - Pleasure. - Monsieur Faucherie of Le Figaro. - How do you do, monsieur? - Fine. I read your articles frequently, I find them most enlightening. - You mean my gossip column, thank you, I'm flattered. - Is this by any chance your first visit? Huh, Hector? - Yes. - And what do you think of it? - I find it almost incredible. Yes indeed, incredible, that what it is. - (laughs) Does your papa know you're here? - Oh, no, I certainly hope not. - Please, Monsieur Faucherie, I beg you, don't not announce in your paper tomorrow. - Don't worry, Hector, I only write on enlightening subjects. (laughing) (audience applauds) - Bravo, wonderful! Wonderful, bravo, bravo! - Thank you, ladies. Thank you. And now, mesdames and messieurs, the Minotaur proudly presents to you the dance of the erotic ostrich. And if you see anything you shouldn't pray, don't hide your heads in the sand. (laughs) (audience applauds) - Nana. I've just seen Fontan. He says everyone is here and they're all waiting to see you. Come on, off with you gown. Into the bath. - Oh, it's cold. - Oh Don't worry. Girard will be here in a minute with some hot water. Just think. Your very first night, and the place is packed. Now, make sure you smile a lot. Ah, Girard, put it over there. Do you have to stand there? Here, this should take the chill out of it. Now, smile at the rich ones. They're the ones you want to like you. (Nana laughs) Girard, have you nothing better to do than to stand around here? Out, out! - I think he's very handsome. - Handsome, huh! Who cares if he's handsome, he hasn't got a sou. (relaxed music) (audience applauds) - Thank you, thank you. And now, mesdames et messieurs, by public demand, the return of the magnificent man of magic and mystery, Monsieur George Mellies! (laughs) (audience applauds) (drum rolls) - I thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tonight I have something very special for you. You have seen my illusions. You have also seen my famous erotic shadow play. And now ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to show you my incredible new invention, the moving photographs with the exciting new actress, Nana! (audience applauds) - Excuse me. (upbeat piano music) (audience laughing) (laughing) (audience applauds) - She's not a good actress, but there's something special about her. - I see you like my new invention the moving photographs. And now, my new actress, Nana! (audience applauds) (relaxed music) - [Man] Bravo. - Excuse me, thank you. (laughs) Thank you. (laughs) Excuse me. (laughs) Well, gentlemen? - Fontan, you were right. This George Mellies, his camera, his moving pictures, fantastic show. But this Nana is by far his greatest invention. I will write a very good article in my newspaper to be sure. - [Fontan] My deepest thanks. - My God, she's beautiful. I'm in love with her. Fontan, that girl is wonderful. We must meet this beautiful Nana. - No problem, no problem. Follow me, come. - Hector, you'd better stay here. This is not for you. You've seen enough for one night. - [Fontan] Come, come. - Yes, monsieur. - Some gentlemen to see Nana. - I'm sorry, but Nana is dressing. - [Fontan] It only takes a moment. - I said no, not now, she just can't. Gentlemen, Nana's just finished her show, she's very tired. She needs time to get changed and have a rest. - Gentlemen. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. - Well, let's go. - No, wait. Look. - [Steiner] What about me? Let me look. (upbeat orchestral music) She's gorgeous. So wonderful. - [Fontan] Look, look, look. (gasping) - Fontan. Fontan, I simply must have that girl. Right now, this very minute. I must-- - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. That's impossible. She just isn't one of my girls. - Then make her one. You must. She's so young. She's so beautiful. She's wonderful. How much will it cost? - 500. - 500. 500 francs? Fontan, you're crazy. 50, and that's-- - Ho, you must be joking, I'm sorry, sir. - It's robbery. 200, 200. All right, five. - Bless you, sir and don't forget to give something to the girl. (laughs) (men laughing) Come with me, sir. Go on, go on, go on! (audience laughing) (women moaning) - Nana. (upbeat music) (Steiner laughing) Oh My Nana. (heavy breathing) - [Muffat] Hector. - Good morning. - You are late. Or should I say early. - Sorry, father, I was-- - Sorry? Your poor mother didn't sleep last night. - But father, I-- - And Rennee. Well, I think she's about to break off the engagement. - Please father, I-- - Hope you have a good excuse, young man. - Forgive me, Mama. - See me in my library. - If you'll excuse me. Yes, Father. - Are those the clothes for the Sorbonne? And I wasn't aware the Sorbonne was in the habit of giving all night lectures. - No, Father, they're not. - Ah! Then perhaps you'd care to tell me where you did spend the night. - [Hector] I was at the Minotaur. - The Minotaur? Why, that's a-- - A bordello. - You, a Muffat? You spent the night in a, I mean in a house of ill repute? Well, if anybody had seen you, I wouldn't be able to show my face in town. Even less at the ministry. Why, only yesterday I was appointed personal escort to the Prince of Scotland, during his state visit. And my son-- - Father, please. - And your mother. Your poor mother. If she knew. What about Rennee? The daughter of the Duke of Cheselles. - Father, you talk as if I don't know who we are. - And you act as if you don't know who we are. Bordello. - I thought I ought to prepare for my wedding day. - Well, did you? - No, Father, I didn't. That is I couldn't. I didn't dare to. - Good heavens, that makes it even worse. - That son of a bitch Fontan. Is this all he gives you? I bet Steiner paid far more than that. - But that's over 200 francs. - That's nothing. Steiner owns a bank. You can get far more than that. The man's wallowing in it. I'll bet he paid Fontan more than twice that amount. Don't give in so easily next time. Make him beg. - Do you think he'll come back? - Oh, he'll be back for more, all right. You can bet on that. But don't take a pittance next time. If a man wants you, make him pay. Horses, carriages, jewels, make him give you his soul. (somber music) - [Mellies] Nana. Nana. - Mellies. - What a beautiful dress. - I have to go to the Minotaur. See you tonight. - Goodbye. Don't be late, we have a show tonight. - [Nana] Bye. That was my stunning new actress, Nana. Goodbye! (upbeat music) - Listen, I'm sorry I'm late, my darling. But I was at Sorbonne with my professor. - Your professor? Strange. Yesterday, I was at the Sorbonne looking for you. And the professor said he hadn't seen you in a month. - You were at the Sorbonne? - Listen, Hector, I'm tired of your lies. I hardly see you anymore. I don't know where you are, or what you are doing. - Rennee, I- - I don't care. I've decided to break our engagement. - Oh, no, you can't mean that. Please, forgive me. I love you very much. I'll speak to my father. And we'll get married soon. Sometime next month. All right? - Nana. - Oh, you. - Where is she? Where's Nana? - [Zoe] There. - Nana. You look so beautiful. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? - [Nana] No, I can't. - I've booked my special table at Maxim's. I can't, I've got a show tonight. - Fontan has promised to let you go straight after the show, so don't worry about that. - [Nana] I don't want to. - Nana. This is for last night. Well? - No. I can't. - Nana. (sensual music) (men laughing) - Stop! Muffat, there's the Minotaur. You've heard of it. I want to go inside. - But, sir, surely you don't want to go in there. This is a house ill repute. - But just the same, I want wine, women and song. - Oh, my Lord, I was asked to show you Paris-- - Ah no, let's go in. Let's go in. Come on, Muffat. - Well, if you insist. But sir, are you sure? - Hector. (laughs) - [Hector] Oh, how are you? - Do you know each other? - I know the young man's father. - This is Xavier de Vandeuvres, king of Parisian nightlife. - Pleased to meet you. - Welcome, my friends. - This is His Royal Highness, the Prince of Scotland. - Your Royal Highness, I'm honored. - My good sir. - Good evening. - Welcome to my humble establishment. - Thank you. - Follow me, I have the best table in the house for you. This way, gentlemen. - Don't look now, Hector, your father's just entered. And he's sitting over there. - You're right, it's Count Muffat. - Oh, my god, I must get out of here! - I'm surprised to see Count Muffat here. (audience applauds) - And now, ladies and gentlemen, a special trick, an unusual photograph, just watch. (harp pinging) Smile. Smile. And now, (Mellies yells) (audience yelling) - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And now, moving photographs with a new exciting actress, Nana! (upbeat piano music) (audience laughing) (audience laughing) (audience applauds) Thank you, thank you. Your Royal Highness, I'm proud to present our brightest new star, little Nana. - [Nana] Your Highness. - Thank you. And may I also present you to the Count Muffat. - A real count? - Yes. I enjoyed your show, you are very lovely. - Thank you. - [Fontan] May I offer you champagne? - Thank you. - Thanks. - [Count Muffat] To you. - Ah, A monocle! May I look? - Yes, of course. - [Nana] Now, do I look like a real countess? - Yes. If you like it, please keep it. As a gift. - Thank you, I must go. Oh, thank you. - Good morning, darling. Where is Hector? I haven't seen him. - He came home very late from his studies last night. So I didn't want to wake him too early this morning. - His studies? Oh, It's good to know the boy is working hard. He'll have to if he is to raise a wife and family. I'll go and wake him up. I have to talk to him. - Don't disturb him. Please. - [Count Muffat] It's important. (relaxed orchestral music) - Hey, you, I've come to see Nana. I must see her. Where is she? Where is she? - Nana, You've come to see Nana? Now the whole world wants to see her. Come. - All these people, for Nana? (upbeat music) - Ah, Nana. You're proving very popular. But don't let success go to your head. - All I see is my success go into your pockets. - You're well paid, you get your share. Besides, I've got my overheads to think of. This place is expensive to run. - Well, don't think I'll spend the rest of my life slaving for you. - Well, do as you please, but elsewhere you're on your own and I doubt if you'd survive. - We'll see about that. - Nana, I must talk to you. Nana, I must see you. I think of you. I think of you all the time. I want you. - Oh, Steiner, please. - Nana, Nana. I think of you all the time. I want you. I want you for myself. - Now, Steiner. - Only for myself. - What does that mean? - I'll give you anything. Anything you want. - Steiner. - Nana. - I just-- - Believe me, anything. - Anything? - Anything? - Yes. Come, tell me. Tell me what you desire and I'll get it for you. Within reason, of course. - Well, I don't like it here. I work too hard. I'd like a big house with a big garden. All of my own. - It's done. (doorbell chimes) - Nana? Come and see this, you won't believe it. It's so beautiful. (relaxed piano music) - Beautiful. - Oh, and look at that over there. Isn't it fantastic? - It's wonderful. Oh, it's lovely. - Yes. (both laughing) - Nana, Nana? - Yes? - Oh, Steiner, I love it. - Where are you? - I love it. - Well, do you like it? - Everything is so wonderful. - Well, do you realize what this property's worth? - Come on. - This is one of the best residential parts of Paris. On the northern end of the boulevard lives the Duke of Danzique, who incidentally is bankrupt. And then, on this end, the Count Muffat and his family. - Count Muffat? - Mm-hm. - I met him at the Minotaur. - I got you out of there just in time. You would have ended up knowing everybody. Damn it, I can only spare a few minutes. I have a busy morning. Nana, Nana. Oh, Nana. - Do you know what cook has just told me? - No, my dear, what is it? - That banker, Steiner. He's given a house to one of his women. The house right next door! She's some little strumpet that works at the Minotaur. - The Minotaur? - It's one of those places one sees, dear. Off the Champs Elysees. Full of foreigners and loose women, who enjoy that sort of thing. - Did you say the house next door? - Yes, The Devillier's property. (sighs) Within no time at all, the entire neighborhood will be a slum. - Nana? Nana, Nana, a man. (Steiner grunting) (Steiner laughing) - I'll see you tonight. - See you tonight. - [Zoe] This is Hector. The young man who sent you flowers. - So, you're Hector. Please, don't get up. I've met your father, a very nice man. - My father? Nana. I've seen your show at the Minotaur and-- And? - I adore you. - Well, that's nothing new. Every man I've ever met has adored me. Every man wants something from me. But would you do something for me? Would you marry me? - I can't. - Oh, why not? - I'm already engaged to be married. - Yes? And who's the lucky girl? Well? - My cousin, her name is Rennee de Cheselles. - [Nana] Rennee de Cheselles? And when is the marriage? - In July. - Well, now, listen. I'll make you a promise. We'll get together, just you and I. On your wedding day. That's an easy date for you to remember. And if you really adore me, you'll be only too happy to do that, hmm? (relaxed orchestral music) My very first party at my own house, imagine that. And everybody from the Minotaur will be coming. - [Zoe] Oh, good. - [Nana] And I've arranged something for them. - What? - A hunt. - A hunt? - Ah, Steiner. - No, no, no, I can't afford it, it's much too much. - It's gonna be beautiful. Look at the flowers. - They're nice. - Come on, look. - It will cost a fortune. - Everything is going to be so lovely. - Excuse me, I need some money. We have to pay them. - All right. - No, that's not enough. - That's enough. - Steiner. - I need more. - No. Oh! - Steiner, please, thank you. - [Zoe] That's for you. This is for you. (Steiner chuckling) - Here you are. And this is for you. (dramatic music) (dogs barking) Nana. Nana! Come, look, the hunt has started. - [NANA] Come look, everybody, the hunt's starting. (guests cheering) - Yes, Come on! Come on, let's look! (guests chattering excitedly) (upbeat music) (horse neighing) (dogs barking) - Over here everyone! (people chattering) (dogs barking) (people chattering) - Look, over there! Oh, isn't it exciting? (people chattering) (people chattering) - He's caught her, He's caught her! (sensual music) (Steiner laughing) - Give it to me! Give, give gimme! (everybody laughing) (Steiner groans) (Steiner laughing) - Let me see. Let me have it! - Ah. - Come, I'll introduce you to Nana. Nana, Nana. Nana, hello. - Faucherie. - This is one of my best friends. Satin. - Hello. I'm pleased to meet you. - I say, everyone. - Pleased to meet you. - Look what's happening! Look, over there! Did you ever see anything like it? (relaxed music) - [Satin] Nana. (doorbell rings) - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Could you tell the lady of the house that Count Muffat is here to see her? - Count Muffat? Come in, sir, come in. - Thank you. One moment, sir. Nana, Nana! Nana, quickly, get dressed. You won't believe who's arrived to see you. Count Muffat. - Count Muffat? - Follow me, sir. - Thank you. - Hello, Count Muffat. What a pleasant surprise. Please sit down, won't you? Well, can I do something for you? Well. I'm terribly sorry to intrude. But there's an important matter that I want to talk to you about. It concerns my son, Hector. You see, he's only a student and he has to complete his final exam. My wife and I, we're very concerned. If he comes to see you all the time-- - Oh, but he's only been here once. - Oh. But the point is-- - Oh, but one second please. What happened? Did you hurt yourself? Oh, my little baby. What's the matter? What's wrong? - What happened? - [Nana] She hurt herself. - Oh. - Aw, poor baby. Poor little bunny. Poor little Casper. Casper. - Oh, Nana. My Nana. If you only knew. I'm sorry, I'm sorry What have I done? My god, I shouldn't have. I lost control. I think I should go. - No, why? Stay. Nana. Nana. - [Man] Whoa! (Steiner laughs) - Why have they blocked the door up? What's happening? Nana! - [Zoe] Steiner! Steiner! - Where is Nana? - Go away! Get away from this house! - What on earth do you mean go away? Where's Nana? - [Zoe] Go away, she doesn't want to see you. - She doesn't want to see me? This is my house. No, it isn't, it's in Nana's name. - Oh, what nonsense is this. Zoe! - You signed it in her name, don't you remember? She's the legal owner. - She's the legal owner. And how does she intend to pay the upkeep? Or pay the property taxes? Tell me that! - Oh, I'm sure she'll manage. Now just go away and leave her alone. - You. You slut, how dare you? This is my house, goddamn you! I'll make you little trollops sorry for this. You mark my words! - Steiner. - Nana. (Steiner gasping) (Nana laughing) (relaxed music) - Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! - [Nana] Come on, up. Come on, boy, up. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on, come one. Come on, up, up. Come on boy, up, up! Come on. Come on, sit up. Sit. Come on, up. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - [Count Moffat] Why are you dressed like that? - I want to be a boy. - A boy? (laughs) Well, that's silly. That would be a pity. Nana. Now tell me, what's wrong? - Nothing. Everything. Nobody loves me. You don't love me. - How can you say such a thing? What do you mean I don't love you? You know I love you. I only want you to be happy. And I will do anything to make you happy. - Anything? - Yes. - Be my horse. - What? - Be my horse. - But, no, no. (mumbles) - Come on, you're my horse. - What are you doing? - Come on, come on! - Nana. - Come on, run! Come on, go faster, go faster. Come on, come on. (laughs) - This is ridiculous. - I don't know how to do it. - I've never done this before. - Come on, come on, go faster. - Go on, go! Giddy up, giddy up. - (laughing) Oh Nana. - Go on, go on! Oh. (Count Moffat groans) - Now, I want you to be my dog. - What? - Go on. Go on, go fetch it, go on. - Oh Nana. - Go fetch it, go on. Go on. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Good boy, good boy. Come on, come on, come on. Come back to me. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. Good boy, good boy. Go fetch it. Come on. Go on. Come on. Go fetch it. Come on. Come on, boy. Come on, come on. Bring it back. Come on, come on, fetch it. Come on. (relaxed music) (Nana whistles) Come on, boy. Good boy. Oh, good boy. (Nana giggles) (people chattering) (somber music) - Nana, so you've come. - So, Satin, this is your little Nana. You're the actress. You look even more beautiful than you do in the moving photographs. - Oh, Felix, leave us alone. - [Felix] Come on Gene, you heard them. - All right. - They want to be left alone. (relaxed music) - Nana. (Satin breathes deeply) Nana. Come. - Nana, I'm so glad that you could find the time to come and visit with me. As I wanted you to meet Bijou. Hey, Bijou. (horse neighing) Isn't he magnificent? - He most certainly is. - I want to buy him. - [Nana] Buy him, for what? - He's a professional fighter, we'll arrange fights for him. He's as strong as an ox, and we'll make a fortune in bets. - How much would he cost. - He belongs to a friend of mine. He wants 500,000 for him. - 500,000? Do you think I could... - Certainly. (tense music) Go on. - Come with me, Bijou. - Bijou. - Oh, Nana. - Oh, but it will be an investment. - [Count Moffat] Nana, I cannot raise that kind of money. - Oh, don't be silly. Of course you can. Please. - Nana. - Please. - You know. You know that I've given you everything you wanted, right? Everything. But this time. As a matter of fact, my financial situation, just now, is not very healthy. - Sell one of your farms in Normandy. - Sell one of my farms in Normandy? But, Nana, that's impossible. I would have to-- - What? - Well, I would have to tell my wife. - Oh, I see. Well, borrow the money. - 500,000? Where could I borrow it from? Borrow it from anybody. Borrow it from Steiner. - Steiner? No. No, no, no. You must be joking. - Why not? You'll make it back. And you could pay it back to him. - Nana, not Steiner, don't ask me that. - Why not? - Nana. Please, no. No. Not that. - Please. - Yes, that's perfect. Very good. Here's an apple for you, sweetheart. - Thank you. - Nana. - Hello. Hello. Faucherie, I'm so glad you came. I want you to do something for me. - Well, Nana, for you, anything. - I think you might even enjoy it. - You want me to kill someone? - (laughs) Not exactly. But I want you to have an affair with a Countess Muffat. Sabine. - Me? You want me to seduce Sabine? - Why not? She doesn't have a lover and she's a good looking lady. - Me and Sabine. Hmm. I'll do it, but why? What are you planning this time? Nana, you are a little devil. - You'll do it? - Why not? - [Nana] Oh, Faucherie, thank you. - Get me the contract. - Yes, sir. - You are required to sign both copies. And of course, we'll require a substantial collateral. - [Count Moffat] What would you suggest? - A property would be acceptable. If you fill in here. Say, your house. You're house on the Boulevard de Batignolles. - [Count Moffat] I see. - Sign here, please. And fill in the address here, please. - [Count Moffat] Pen? - [Steiner] Thank you. (somber music) (people chattering) - Oh, it's so exciting. - There. - I can't wait. - All right. - Come and sit down. - [Nana] Now come on, Bijou, we've just got to win. - And now, ladies and gentlemen introducing the cock fight of the century. In the yellow pantaloons, Bijou. (everyone applauds) And in the red, Achmed the Turk. Place your bets. Place your bets now. (laughs) Come on! Place your bets now. Place your bets. Come along now, come on. Achmed. Is it to be Achmed or Bijou to win this magnificent spectacle? (dramatic drum music) (men yelling) Carry on fighting. Carry on, carry on. Okay. Careful. Place your bets now. Place your bets, that's it. Break! End of Round one, to your corners. Come along now. - [Steiner] You are doing very well. Keep it going, - [Nana] Come one, Bijou. - [Fontan] Come on now. (laughs) That's it, give them a drink to refresh them. Get them more shoes. (laughs) Now come the spurs. Now we'll see some blood. Place your money now. Come along. (everyone cheering) (everyone applauding) (SCREAMS) - Come on, Bijou. - Come on, Achmed. On your feet, stand. Fight! Come on. (people applauding) End of Round two. Back to your corners. That's it. (laughs) Give them a round of applause. Jolly good. Place your bets. Now, - Now this is your chance. - the final decorations, - Bijou, kill him. - we're going in for the kill. My this is a cock fight, I'll tell you! May the best man win. May the best man win. Right, get yourself ready, men. Here we go. Get yourself ready. Nearly time to begin again. That's it, have a little drink before we start. All ready? Right on your feet now. - Good luck Bijou. - Come along! Round three! (audience applauds) (dramatic music) There's still time to bet some money! There's still time to get some money on! - Bijou! - [Fontan] Collect your money now. (downbeat music) - Don't be upset. Never mind. Come, come to bed. - No I don't feel like it. - But why? It's only money. - Only money? I am ruined. And I'm not only thinking of myself. What about my family? My poor wife. - Your poor wife? Your wife gets everything she needs from Faucherie. I'm sure she can get some money too. - Faucherie? - Yes, Faucherie. Listen, if you care so much about your wife why don't you go back to her? - Nana. - Go on, go home! Get out! I don't want you here anymore. - Nana, please. - Go on, leave! Get out of my house! Go on, get out! (relaxed music) (Sabine giggles) - You! (upbeat music) (guns firing) (Count Moffat grunts) (somber music) - I don't understand. - Don't you understand? This is an eviction notice, Madame. You have precisely one hour to leave the premises. This house, all adjacent grounds, stables and out houses now belong to the Steiner Bank. This is to include furniture, personal belongings, clothing, pictures, painting. In short, get out. - This is all your fault. Because of you and your strumpet, we're ruined. Ruined. (piano music) - Nana. Stop playing. Listen to me. - What? - From now I intend to stay with you. - I don't understand you. - Steiner has taken my house. - Yes, but here? Well, I. I mean, I. If that doesn't inconvenience you? - No, no, on the contrary. - Ah. - Now I can come to Hector's wedding with you. - No, Nana. No you can't. - Why not? - Well, I, I don't know. It's out of the question. - Oh, I see. I'm good enough for you to come and live with when you're homeless, but not good enough to go to your precious sons wedding. We'll see. - Yes, that's it, that's it. Very nice. Now let me see. Now, raise it forward, a little forward. Move it down here, down here now. Go on, this is it, this it. Just here. (upbeat music) Oh, the sun. Yes, that's fine. Forward! There. Oh, lovely. Good. No, no, this way. This way, this way, yes. No, look. The sun, you see. I have to. (Mellies muttering) Down there. Move that way. Yes. Oh! (relaxed music) - Go on! - Oh, Nana! Nana! - [Count Moffat] Hector! Hector! Stop! Wait Hector! (Hector laughing) - Nana! Nana, wait for me! Faster! - Hector! Hector! (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Good evening. - This way. - Look who's here. The enemies have become the best of friends. - Well, he is the new minister of finance. - Well don't tell me. I wrote a big article about it in The Figaro. - Were you surprised that they appointed him? (Fontan speaks in foreign language) He's a good customer. Here you are, Satin. That will cheer you up for sure. Make you feel better. - [Faucherie] What's the matter with you, Satin? You look so sad. - Haven't you heard about Nana? - You know she's leaving Paris.
