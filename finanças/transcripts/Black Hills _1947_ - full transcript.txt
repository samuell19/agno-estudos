Hello, Janet. Good morning, dad. You're looking very pretty this morning. Oh, dad, I kind of think you like me. Going out on the south range? No. Riding into town? No. You wouldn't be keeping secrets, would you? Maybe. There's your mail, dad. Thanks, Larry. Nothing but bills. Who's your letter from, Larry? And old friend-- Eddie Dean of blue river. He's heading here for a cattle drive-- says he'll visit. I'll be glad to see if he's that fast-shooting hard-riding wonder you've told me about. You'll find out. Dad, we need a new foreman-- Eddie's the man for the job if he'll take it. I'm afraid we can't afford the extra expense, unless we can get the land company to give US more time on our mortgage payment. If they'll only wait until after spring roundup, we can make it. You're really not worried, are you? Not too much-- in fact, I'm hoping to have some good news very soon. What do you mean, dad? You'll find out. Dad's been acting kind of mysterious lately. He sure has. I wonder why old Hadley's heading into the blind canyon. Well, it's on his own place, ain't it? He'd probably want to know what you're doing on the bar-x. I guess he would. He told me once never to set foot on his ranch again. He claimed he got a crooked deal in a poker game at my saloon. Well, he probably did. He couldn't prove it. But he did keep a lot of business away from me for a while. Hey, look at what he's doing now. It's a hidden cave. Let's find out what's going on. Hello, Kirby. Howdy. Looks like you found something. Look at this vein of ore. Holy cats, what a ledge! I've seen gold strikes in my time, but never anything to equal this. I had a hunch I'd strike it. But I've been keeping quiet about it. I haven't even told my youngsters-- didn't want them to build up false hopes. You mean nobody knows anything about this? That's right. I reckon I'll spread the news, now. You're not going to tell anyone about this. [ Gunshot ] Open up that powder and set the fuse. [ Explosion ] No one would ever know there's a fortune in gold under that land slide. And no one will until I take over this ranch. How you gonna do it? Allen's land company will own the place as soon as they foreclose on it. I've got some ideas about that-- let's get back to flagstone. There you are, chiquita, you've been bringing me luck. I head they've give old man Hadley up for dead. Why shouldn't they? It's two weeks since they found his horse and no sign of him. I suppose they'll be finding his body at the bottom of a ravine someday. Are his kids gonna sell the bar-x? Nope. Young Hadley's refused all offers. You tried to buy, didn't you, Kirby? Yes, I think the boy's a fool not to sell. I'll open. Oh, Don, can I have this afternoon off? No, you're paid to work here. But Dan-- I'm busy! Larry Hadley's in town-- he just sold some of the bar-x cattle. He can't be getting a good price this time of year. He only got enough to meet his payroll and expenses. That'll get him out of the hole till roundup time. The bar-x has got to stay in a hole or it'll interfere with my plans. Where is he now? Up at the land company, cashing a check. Take some men, trail him out of town, and get that money. Is young Hadley still in the land company office? Yeah, he's still over there. There you are, Larry. It's too bad you had to sell any cattle at this time. I still have the main herd-- if nothing happens between now and roundup time, I'll be in the clear. Good. I'll be back from my trip east about then, tuttle here'll run things while I'm away. I'll try to run things. Look, Mr. Allen, the mortgage on my ranch fall due in two weeks-- now, don't worry. You've had plenty of trouble, losing your dad and all, I'll just extend the due date till after I've got back. I don't know how to thank you. Don't even try, my boy. Just keep up your courage and run the ranch right. I'm countin' on a friend of mine to help me out--Eddie Dean. Eddie Dean... I've heard of him. You're lucky to have him for a friend. Thanks, and goodbye.

Let's even things up a little, soapy. Climb down and hand over your money. Eddie Dean! Larry! What's going on? A holdup-- they got my payroll! Let's get it back! [ Bullet ricochets ] [ Gun empty ] Hey, maybe it'll fit me. I got my payroll back. At least they didn't get that- who were they? I don't know. Looks like one of 'em lost his hat. A.q.--that's sort of an unusual initial. A.q.--it could be al quillen. What does he do for a living? All I've ever seen him do is play poker at the saloon. I think I'll look into this. Gee whiz, dad b-b-b-burn it, aw, heck-- there goes our vacation. First thing we'll do is get you back home with the payroll. How are the folks? I have some bad news, Eddie. Tell me about it as we ride. Eddie: A nice layout, Larry. By roundup time we should have it in good shape. Larry: Boys, meet Eddie Dean-- our new foreman. Hiya, boys. Sis, this is Eddie Dean. How do you do, miss Hadley? Please, call me Janet, I've heard so much about you, I feel as though we're old friends. And this is his pal, soapy Jones. Hello, soapy. Howdy, ma'am. A little card trick I'd like to show you, ma'am. Pick a card, pick any card, but be sure and don't show it to me, see? You got it? Okay, put it back. ♪ Doh, Dee doh, Dee doh... ♪ This your card? No, queen of hearts. Well, that's a good card, too. It shows you're lucky in love. [ Horse whinnies ] Oh, yeah? That's all, brother. Ha ha! You better drop card tricks and take up fortune tellin'. I've told Eddie how things are going, and he's agreed to be our foreman. That's wonderful, because we do need help. That's what friends are for. Larry told me about your father-- I'm sorry to hear it. It could be that someone's trying to make trouble for you. That attack on you today might be part of it. But we have no enemies that I know of. I think I'll ride into flagstone and look up the man who lost that hat. Come on, soap. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's all right. Ah, senorita-- do you know anything about cards? Sure, I know all about them. I've got this card trick I'd like to show you. So I'm going into a trance and you just pick a card, see? Okay. So I'm going into the trance now. I'm in the trance now. Seven of spades. No, senorita, you pick a card, but pick a card out of the d-d-d-deck! Oh, I get it, pick a card out of the deck. Yeah. Si, si. Try it again. Ace of hearts. No, pick a card out of the deck, but don't tell me what it is! Oh, I'm not supposed to tell you what it is? Noooo. Oh. All right, try it again. Atta girl. ♪ Doo, Dee doo, Dee doo ♪ Queen of hearts. No, it was the ace of diamonds. Well, that shows you're going to marry a very rich man. Oh! I'm going to marry a very rich man. Don't look at me. Ha ha ha! Oh, yes--i think this hat belongs to a man named al quillen. It looks like al's-- he's playing poker back there. Would you mind giving it to him? No, not at all. Marry a rich man--hah! A man just found your hat, al. Say, uh, you went to a lot of trouble to return this, stranger. Maybe you went to a lot of trouble losing it. That's the man that messed up our payroll grab. You better give quillen a hand. What's it to you if my hat blows off while I'm riding the range? I'm foreman of the bar-x, and that's where I found it-- under funny circumstances. That doesn't prove anything, except that the wind blew it there. Stay out of the wind. You might lose your head next time. Don't tell me what to do. Hands off of your guns, men. We're gonna keep this fight sorta private. We can wake these two rats up in time for supper. Come on, Eddie. So Mr. Dean is the new foreman of the bar-x ranch. We can take care of him, all right. Yeah, looks like it. Never mind him now-- it's the ranch I'm after. And I'm ready to make my next move to get it. How are you, tuttle? Fine. What can I do for you I don't like to pressure, tuttle, but these I.O.U.'S for your poker losses at my place-- what about them? I need more time. I've already paid back $2000 of what I owe you. That's right. What I'd like to know is how you raised that much money on your salary. I, uh, sold some property I owned. You're not fooling me. You've been stealing the cash receipts here and juggling the books. That's not true! I can tell Mr. Allen to examine the records. No, no, don't do that, it'll mean jail for me. Take it easy. How would you like to have me tear these up, and give you the money to replace what you took? You mean that? Would you do it? On one condition-- sell me the mortgage on the bar-x ranch. I can't without Allen's permission. He promised Larry to extend the time on it. But you could write a letter with Allen's signatue agreeing to sell. Allen'll find out when he comes back. I'll take care of that when the time comes. Do this and I'll cut you in on something big later. All right. Date that letter so I can foreclose while the bar-x people are away on their roundup. ♪ Punchinello, punchinello ♪ ♪ punchinello the punchy cow puncher ♪ ♪ oh, he hails from the wide open spaces ♪ ♪ he's the pride of the tenderfoot trail ♪ ♪ Punchinello, punchinello ♪ ♪ punchinello, the punchy cow puncher ♪ ♪ he lassoed a poor little doggie one day ♪ ♪ and the crowd on the bench shouted hip-hip-hooray ♪ ♪ but he branded himself and the calf got away ♪ ♪ he's the pride of the tenderfoot trail ♪ ♪ what a fellow, punchinello ♪ ♪ oh, the things that he did were a sin ♪ ♪ he would saddle his pony up backwards ♪ ♪ 'cause he wanted to see where he'd been ♪ ♪ Punchinello, punchinello ♪ ♪ punchinello, the punchy cow puncher ♪ ♪ he twirled his two 6-guns round with a spin ♪ ♪ and the roar of the shots made a terrible din ♪ ♪ now he has but nine toes ♪ ♪ where he used to have ten ♪ ♪ he's the pride of the tenderfoot trail ♪ ♪ what a fellow, punchinello ♪ ♪ oh, the things that he did were a joke ♪ ♪ he would start out to break in a bronco ♪ ♪ but he'd wind up the one who got broke ♪ ♪ Punchinello, punchinello ♪ ♪ punchinello, the punchy cow puncher ♪ ♪ he swore he could ride anything with four feet ♪ ♪ till he mounted a horse known as poisonous Pete ♪ ♪ now he sleeps on his face ♪ ♪ and he stands up to eat ♪ ♪ he's the pride of the tenderfoot trail ♪ ♪ what a fellow, punchinello ♪ ♪ oh, the things that he did were a laugh ♪ ♪ when the cook put some salt in his coffee ♪ ♪ punchy sawed the Chuck wagon in half ♪ ♪ Punchinello, punchinello ♪ ♪ punchinello, the punchy cow puncher ♪ ♪ he packed up his duds and he pulled out of town ♪ ♪ but he soon became known as a man of renown ♪ ♪ for he's famous at last ♪ ♪ as a rodeo clown ♪ ♪ he's the pride of the tenderfoot trail ♪ ♪ what a fellow, punchinello ♪ ♪ oh, the dough that he's makin' ain't hay ♪ ♪ now he owns a big ranch down in Texas ♪ ♪ where I'm workin' for two bucks a day ♪♪♪♪♪ Ha ha ha! Larry, it's been a great roundup, never saw finer beef ready for market. We're gonna get top prices for 'em, thanks to you. We couldn't have done it without your help. Aw, you folks'll make my head swell. Plan on startin' a drive north in a couple of days? Yeah, it'll take that time to round up the strays. Sis, we'll get you back to the ranch in the morning. Boys, better get some sleep-- we got a lot of work ahead. Hey, what about our v-v-v-vacation? Oh! Whoo! Now, what are quillen and his men doing on my ranch? Let's find out. Have you got any business here on the Hadley ranch, quillen? Hadley ranch? Take a look at that foreclosure notice. There must be some mistake. This paper is signed by Dan Kirby. That's right--he bought the ranch from the land company. I'm takin' possession for him right now. This notice doesn't take effect until tonight at midnight. Take it with you. Don't move! That's my boy that did that, you rats! Now take your men and get out of here. I can't understand why Allen sold the mortgage to Kirby. He certainly didn't intend to when he went away. Now what are we going to do, Eddie? We'll stop in at the land company office and find out about this. I'll be over at the saloon in case you need me. Tuttle: Hiya, folks, what can I do for you? Isn't Allen back yet? No, he's still in Chicago. Then who sold Kirby the mortgage on my ranch? I did--i had to, it was Mr. Allen's written orders. Here's the letter he wrote me. "My business hasn't turned out so well, and I need cash. "If Kirby still wants to buy the bar-x mortgage, sell it to him at once." It's signed by Allen, all right. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it in his own writing. When will he be back? I don't know. Well, I guess that's all we can find out here. I still don't like the looks of this. Where does Allen usually stay in Chicago? The imperial hotel. Let's telegraph him, see if he confirms that letter. That's a splendid idea. Uh, ma'am, p-p-p-pick a card out of the deck, but d-d-d-don't t-t-t-tell me what it is. This your card? No. This my card. Ha ha ha! Well, ma'am, I finally got this trick all worked out. Now, you just p-p-p-pick a card, any card. No, not that one! Go away--Kirby will shoot you if he finds you in here. Shoot me? Why? He'll think you're spying on him-- please go! Kirby, I gotta talk to you about the bar-x situation. Kirby: Something wrong? Plenty. Quick, hide! No, no, here! Hurry, hurry! I'm hurrying. Better come inside. I got a letter from Allen postmarked El Paso. Tuttle: He'll be here in an hour on the 3 o'clock stage. When he finds out about the bar-x mortgage, we'll all land in jail. He's not going to find out-- he's not even going to get here. Quillen, take some men and meet that stage outside of ranchito. Just leave it to US. You'd better stay here until you calm down. There's a bottle of my private stock in the closet--help yourself. Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! The basket, it must have fallen on your head from the shelf. Yes. Ha ha ha! Kirby just sent quillen and some men over to stop the stage near ranchito. What for? Allen's on it. And I heard tuttle admit that there's something crooked with the bar-x mortgage sale. Then Allen's life is in danger. I can cut through regal pass and beat them to the stage. Tell Larry and Janet to get out to the ranch and say nothing about this. Eddie: Hold it, driver. Do you have a passenger by the name of Henry Allen? I'm Henry Allen. What do you want? My name's Eddie Dean, foreman of the bar-x. Your life's in danger, Mr. Allen. This is a good spot, the stage will have to slow down when it hits the curve in the road. Yeah, it oughta be along pretty soon. If what you say is true, there's crooked work going on in my office, and the sooner I get back there, the better. But Kirby's men will never let you get there alive. One way or another, they're out to kill you. Have you any plans? Yes, I have. Take my horse, wait till it's dark, and slip into town. Meet me back at your office at 8 o'clock. All right. I'll ride the stage in. Don't take the regular route, swing around bayou flat. There's the stage now. He's taking a different road! Heeyah! How did Dean get on the stage? I don't know, but Kirby's gonna raise Cain when we tell him. [ Moaning ] What I'd like to know is why did Dean get on the stage and where is Allen? They ain't in town, I've got men posted everywhere. We've got to find him, or we lose the bar-x and a fortune in gold. It's a cinch that Dean knows where Allen is. Right. Dean's up to something, and we can find out what if we watch every move he makes. Hello, Dean. I'm glad you got here safe, Allen. Let's get over to my office and have a look at those records. We better go in the back way. Allen! What's the idea, tuttle? Making a getaway? I was just balancing the books and the cash on hand. I'm curious to see those books. And you might show him that letter you said he wrote about the bar-x mortgage. Yes, of course-- it's in this drawer. Hold it. You can't clear yourself with a 6-gun, tuttle. You better come clean. All right-- I'll tell you the truth. I lost all my money gambling in Kirby's saloon. Then I started to use your cash. This is our chance to take care of Allen and pin the whole thing on Dean. Now, don't slip up on this. Don't worry. Kirby threatened me with exposure, so I had to take his orders. Kirby isn't a cattle man-- why did he want the bar-x? I don't know.You're lying. There's something behind all this. It's tied up with Hadley's death in some way, isn't it? I-I wasn't in on that! Kirby killed the old man! Why? Because Hadley had struck gold in a cave on his ranch. He's kept it secret from everyone. That's why Kirby wants the ranch at any price. Write down everything you've said-- quillen: Don't move! Drop those guns, Dean. What do you men want here? They're Kirby's men. Cooper, give US time to get to the saloon and then-- right. Sheriff: "Your soul is like a ship on the ocean of life "with its Roman billows and the wave of strife. "When you have not traveled this ocean before, "how can your own hand guide you safe to the shore?" Evenin', sheriff. Hiya, soapy. "Here lie sunken rocks and..." I haven't got time-- I'm a busy man. "The lure of divine love". I can see you're awful busy. Have you seen Eddie Dean around town? Not tonight. I've been lookin' all over for him. It ain't like Eddie just to disappear like that. [ Gunshot ] Uh-oh! [ Gunshots ] [ Crowd murmuring ] Sheriff: What's goin' on here? Cooper: Robbery and murder-- you better come inside, sheriff. Break it up, boys. Eddie! It's Henry Allen! It's too late to do anything for him. How did you get mixed up in this? I was passing by, I heard a sht and busted in here. Dean was standing at the safe, holding his gun. He shot at me as I came in, we tangled, and I knocked him out. Let me see your gun. Hasn't been fired. You'd better take a look at Dean's gun. It this Dean's gun? Yes, but-- there's been three shots fired from it. Are you gonna believe that hyena's story before you hear Eddie's side of it? I'm puttin' Dean under arrest right now. Cooper, be in town for the inquest tomorrow. I'll be here. Help me get him over to the jail. Then the sheriff says, "Cooper, be at the inquest," and I says, "I'll be there." Ha ha ha! Did you spread the word around town like I told you? Yeah, there's a crowd gathering right now. They're gonna take the law into their own hands. Well, I guess that takes care of Mr. Dean. How does your head feel? It'll feel better when I find out if you believe my story. I'm gonna surprise you-- I do believe it. You see, I ran into Allen earlier this evening and he told me why he was slipping into town to meet you. Then why did you arrest me? To keep the crowd from grabbing you. They're plenty worked up over Allen's murder. Hey, sheriff! It's soapy j-j-j-, soapy j-j-j--- you know me, let me in! There's a mob forming. They're planning on busting in here and getting Eddie. We'll go over to the silver dollar and get Kirby. Kirby: What time is it, tuttle? Quarter to twelve. In fifteen minutes, I'll be legal owner of the bar-x. Here comes the sheriff with Dean--what's up? What's on your mind, sheriff? We just want to get things straightened out. Dean here says that Allen was killed by your men on orders from you. Why on earth would I want Allen killed? Because he could have proved he never sold you that mortgage. Tuttle confessed the whole plot. Is that true? No, it's a pack of lies. Have you got any witnesses to prove what you say? You see, sheriff, Dean killed Allen and was caught red-handed. Now he cooks up phony charges against me. You're forgetting one thing. When the sheriff opens that gold mine on the bar-x, it'll uncover evidence that'll hang you-- the body of John Hadley. You fool! Did you tell him about that? You're under arrest. Sheriff, take care of tuttle-- come on, soapy! [ Gunshots ] Soapy: Keep your hands up, or I'll blast ya! [ Gun empty ] Eddie, would you change your mind and stay on with US a while longer? No, thanks, but I'll drop around every once in a while to see how you're getting along. We'll be doing all right with a prosperous ranch and a rich gold mine, and we owe it all to you. I've got a card trick I'd like to show you. All you got to do is pick a card, but don't let me see what it is. Yes, soapy. Know what it is? Okay, just put it back.
