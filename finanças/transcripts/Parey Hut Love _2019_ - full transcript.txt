Massage my shoulders too. Sister, Farida, I am going to be a mother-in-law. That's why I don't have the time to breathe. Samira. Come here. Come here. Give me sweets. What design are you making? Make a 'pasley.' Sheheryar is coming too, isn't he? - Mother! Ask aunt Farida whether Sheheryar has spoken to Karishma Chaudhry or not. I even mentioned Karishma on the facebook invite. You have expectations from Sheheryar? - You are absolutely correct, sister Farida. You can forget about Karishma Chaudhry coming now. Sheheryar is an nice child. Find a nice girl and get him married quickly. Then see what he does. - Mother. Why do you want to ruin some girl's life? He is a commitment-phobe who only breaks hearts and does nothing else. Tell Sheheryar Natasha is eagerly waiting for Karishma Chaudhry. Yes, I will tell him. Okay. Goodbye. - Goodbye. This is such a hassle! Why do we have to suffer if Sheheryar wants to live in this filth? He is just a child. Don't be so mean? Take this. Take it. Take this too. Take this too. Take everything. Just spare us. Please. I won't give you this ring. It is for Sheheryar's bride. What are you doing mother? You are calling me mother.. ..And yet you rob your family as well? Your sari. - No! I don't want it. It is stuck in the door. Oh! I see. Thank you. Thanks. I thought.. You misunderstood. I am a target myself, aunty. I'm not a killer. Damn! I am on vacations! Climb up. Grandma, take the stairs. This lift won't come. Do I look like a grandma to you? If you wait for the lift you will become a great grandma. Bad brought up! You brought disgrace on me. What will happen to this sin that's growing in my womb? Sin? Cheat! Traitor! I will kill you as well as this sin. Seema! Seema, I.. I am helpless, Seema. Please treat it as a youthful mistake and.. I will not spare you. I will go to your mother.. ..And thrust this sin into her arms. In my arms? No. Cut! If this had been Sangeeta's set this sound would not be heard. Your mother. Why are you insulting? - I am not insulting. Mother. Hashtag, your mom. Outside. It's a raid! - Aunty is here. Wow! Aunty is here? Mummy will come in and make a noise. I am doomed because of you. Who put my boxers on the chair? Who is there? Aunty! Where is she? Where is she? - Who? Where is she? - Who? Where is the mother of my unborn grandchild? Who? What? - Whose shoes are those? These? These are mine. I bought them at a sale. Oh My God! Buy one get one free. Gross! I wish I didn't live to see this day. What about the baby? - It happens. Science has made a lot of progress. Just look into each other's eyes. Especially if you're cockeyed. Give me water. Only if it is bottled. Make yourself comfortable, aunty. I'll bring it. What is the matter with you? What will I tell the world? That my son is one of them? Mom. Please stop this. It's not what you think. We were rehearsing for a drama.. ..And I just might get the lead role. I saw your last drama with all my kitty party friends. You died before the title when you told me this role revolves around you. My death was the central idea of the story. They will look for these clues in at least 260 episodes. Then I might come back to life.. ..Or it could be I have a twin brother. I wish you had a twin brother. He would help your father with the business. He would be our crutch for our old age. He would not die before the title like you did. Hello, aunt. Aunt? Who are you? - Neighbor. We had only tap water, so I thought I'd boil it. Then I thought I might as well prepare tea. Mummy, Shabbo lives in the flat across.. ..And supervises the Production work with Arshad. This is such a beautiful shirt! - I brought it for Sheheryar. If I hadn't brought it he would go to the henna ceremony in old clothes. You two can join in. - A mother's desire. You want to see your son married, right? Marriage. Marriage. Marriage. Why is this community obsessed with marriage? In every neighborhood whether you find a school or not.. Will surely find a wedding hall. Why are you allergic to weddings? Listen. Your aunt called ten times. Natasha is very excited about that actress Karishma. You will bring her to Natasha's henna ceremony, won't you? What? - Yes. I told you not to brag. Speak less. She will come if I call. One can't get a pizza if you call. How can you expect Karishma to come? Please try. My honor is at stake. Okay, why don't you..? - You. Yes, yes. I am doing it. Like this. Tanaaz. - Yes. Like this from the top. How can it be done now? Sheheryar? She will come now and create a racket. - Thank God, you're here. Did you find Karishma? - Yes. Yes. It'll be done. It will, won't it? - Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't worry. - So excited! Don't let me down, cousin brother. - No. Never. Deceiving the bride is not a good title. Try. Plead with her. Do something. Please! Hurry. Hurry. - I am hurrying. What do you want me to do? Get in the phone? Speak softly. Someone will see. - Who is going to see? Brother-in-law. Nervous. - You look it. He can't find Karishma Chaudhry. That's why Natasha will throw the book at him for that. Karishma. The film star? Yes. For tonight. What's the big deal? I shall arrange it. Brother Tashi. Anwar here. Brother Tashi, tell Karishma Chaurdhry she must come today.. ..To my henna ceremony. Tell her I invited her. I shall text the address of the farmhouse. Thank you. She will come. Who were you talking to? My friend is the head of the finance department at a channel. Oh! He will do it. Where did you find this Nawazzudin Siddique type of groom? I must say this is a wonderful party! This is Feroza's doing. She is a perfectionist. But the thing that makes me the happiest today.. ..Is that Saniya and you are with me. After returning I too realize.. ..Everything that I have missed. Our people. Our surroundings. Our culture. Thankfully even Saniya got permission to come.. ..For it was almost impossible for her to come with the thesis going on. I'm glad she came too. Where is she? I haven't had a proper conversation with her as yet. She must be around here somewhere. She must be adjusting to the culture. 16 years is a very long time. Faisal, my friend. How are you? Take this. Give it to aunty. Go and give it to her quickly. Sheheryar! Faisal, meet my son. The actor. And Sheheryar, this is uncle Faisal. Your uncle's older brother. Oh, wow! What an honor, uncle Faisal. I am a big fan of your work. Good to see you, Sheheryar. - Great to see you, sir. You wrote such beautiful stories! The characters were superb! But I've always wondered.. ..Why did you stop writing at the peak of your career? I had written many stories. I forgot to write my own story. I set out in that quest. Brother Faisal had a big business in Turkey. What is your plan for the future, Faisal? After the death of my wife I felt my story is coming to an end. I wish to write some more stories before it ends. Wonderful! Welcome back to the movies, sir. Excuse me. I'll go and irritate my wife a little. Sheheryar. Please pass this forward. You go ahead. I'll follow you. You want some? Flowers. Are you selling them? Who can sell fragrance? Are you a poet? In the process. Gradually. Hello, Sheheryar! Buddy. Long time. You've forgotten about me. Isn't that right? - Yeah. Come over to my showroom. Hello, pretty lady. Zaigam at your service. Handicrafts. Pure Pakistani. Made in China. Zaigam, how is your girlfriend? She is not my girlfriend anymore. Oh, I see. I see. Very good! Incidentally she was of loose character. She made passes at me. She even went out with Arshad. Dumping her was a good move. I did not dump her. - Really? She is my wife now. Wife? Excuse me. Sister-in-law. She was not the girlfriend type. She was the wife type. You're strange. You didn't tell me. You didn't invite me to the wedding. Do you have kids? See, I have to go Wow! Karishma is here. - Karishma is here. I'll be right back. O my God! Karishma.

Thank you, Ms. Karishma. Come. Let's leave. What are you doing these days? I am going to Malaysia. Oh, really! Business or pleasure? I am going first class. Shall we? It is time for your laxative. - Okay. Thank you, cousin brother. Yeah. Thanks, partner. Anytime, brother-in-law. Anytime. You didn't take even one selfie. Looking nice. My handsome boy! Hands with curry on them! Mom. Who is that? - Who? Who else is here? Saniya? She is Faisal's daughter. She has come from Turkey. She's gorgeous! I'll be right back. Hi. Hi. You dance very well. Have you learned? - Yes. From DVD Khan. Will you have rice pudding? Don't eat it with a spoon. It's an insult. With a finger. Like this. I'm Sheheryar I know. I am a distant cousin of yours. This is an old news So, what do you think of our country? First it seemed strange but now it seems familiar. Are you flirting with me? No. Just acting like you. Tell me. What role are you playing these days? Of a hunter or hunted. Wounded. Sheheryar. Huma? You did not call me after the party. I was really looking forward to it. Really? Why? Why? Actually my phone was stolen. You aren't making excuses, are you? No. You know, stuff happens. Look, Huma. I'd better run, but.. ..Call me. Really? Close friend? She's a nut job. She talks to me as if.. I don't know. We've only met a couple of times. It seemed that way. Saniya! Lets go .. Look, I better go. What's your plan? A friend is hosting a beach party. I was planning on going there. - What a pity. I am staying here at Natasha's place. Anyway, bye. Bye. "Are you the full moon or the sun?" Those locks and those looks. I think God has answered my prayers today. Perfect Just Perfect What? Light. If Karishma Chaudhry were seated in this light she would say.. Perfecto! So you can see Karishma Chaudhry in my place right now. The light is to blame. We have a naturally lighted frame. It's bound to remind one of Karishma Chaudhry, not Chaudhry Shujaat. An unromantic man like you knows nothing about romance. Excuse me. I was called Fawad Khan in college. Really? I don't know about Fawad Khan.. ..But I'm sure they must have called you Adnan Sami Khan! Hey. What? Why are you sad, Tanaaz? Everybody is getting married. For me it's an absolutely hopeless situation. All the Parsis have gone to Canada. No eligible bachelor is left behind for me. Rustom I will die a virgin. Like Madonna. You silly! Madonna is not a virgin. Why don't you get married, Rustom? Will you marry me? Get lost! You are my friend. It's okay. Are you planning for new generation? Shut up! Friday noon. Casserole. My house. Mamma makes it so well. Yes. I'll bring the prawn kebabs. You will bring kebabs? - Not too spicy. How about you, Sheheryar? Coming? Stop the car. Please stop the car. What's the matter? - I'm going back. I'll drop you. - No. No. I shall walk it. I need some fresh air. Is there stale air in the car? I'll see you guys later. He has lost his mind. Not even dacoits get out at night over here. You guys have fun. I'll be fine. - He's completely lost it. Come on, come on, boys. Come on. Come on. Get up. Take your places. Come on, come on. Run to your area! Girls, you get up as well. Come on. Use some strength. Make your own beds. Don't sleep here. Hurry! Cousin. How could I let you guys enjoy all by yourselves? I'm back. Hello. - Brother-in-law? Welcome back, partner. You keep my secret while I keep your secret. Hey! Change your mind, huh? Hi. Hey. What were you doing here all by yourself? I was counting stars. "The stars light up one by one." "Your feet walking towards my destination." Faiz. I am impressed That reminds me. "I love your lips. I love your smile." "But most of all, I love your feet.. ..As they walk towards me." Pablo Neruda. Now I am impressed. You have brains along with looks. If I wanted to flirt with you, I would say I wrote that poem. For whom would you write it? I haven't had the time to discover this city. Let's go. I'll show you the city of lights. "Although the lights are flickering.." "But people are still keeping the flames of their lanterns high." Let's go. Damn it! You know.. ..We've met before? You remember playing hide and seek with Natasha? I used to wear frocks and you wore knickers. You are Nikki? The one with piggy tails. - Yeah. The swan who turned into an ugly duckling. You hide well even back then. Nobody could find you. All of us would get tired and go away.. ..But you'd be sitting in your secret corner. Even back then? I don't hide now. Have you seen your eyes? So shifty. Like you're afraid of being caught. "Amidst the chaos of the surroundings.." "There is a moment frozen in time," "I am astray. My feet are astray." "Fragrance emanates from each and every pore" "Without thinking, without grasping" "I'm resolute in this journey" "My heart still stays with me" "Though I know not when it escaped me" "Without words, the eyes have spoken" "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." "There were calls in my prayers, But no one within those calls" "The warmth of your breath touched me" "And It felt like I had been rewarded" "There's a plea on my lips" "Someone faithful brought meaning to my prayer" "My heart was a traveller, aimlessly wandering." "Amazed at where it has led me" "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect" "O my beloved, don't beguile me" "Without thinking, without grasping." "I'm resolute in this journey." "My heart still stays with me" "Though I know not when it escaped me." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." Your fathers stories brought to screen from the pages in this studio. "O my beloved, don't beguile me." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." I am a big fan of uncle Faisal. I have seen all his films. I am greatly inspired by him. Even I am a big fan of his. Poetry, music and old films. My choice is just like my dad's. "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." What did you wish? Pakistan. And you? I am Pakistan. Let's take a picture. O my God! No signals. Can we go back? Everyone must be worried. These were the only few moments which were free from time's jail. She has never done this before. And why would she leave without informing me? I can't make sense. This area is dangerous. You should remain cautious. Anyway, we are looking for her. By God's will, we will surely find her. Lets Go As for the boy.. ..Can he be trusted? I think it was left turn? Right? Yes. I think it was right. Yes, you are right. Damn We still don't have signals. Shouldn't we ask them for directions? Get away from the kidnapper, ma'am! Kidnapper, hands up! - Kidnapper? You have nowhere to run. He can't go anywhere in any case. It was wrong. You could have informed me at the very least. All of us were so worried. Go and send Sheheryar. Your turn. Death penalty or life imprisonment? He will render the verdict. Life imprisonment is a good option. Take it. Did you enjoy the reprimand? That was no reprimand. Father does not get angry. He says both, time and blood are wasted. And my mom thought we'd eloped. Eloped? But why? Because their mind only revolves around marriage. How did marriage get into this? Very true. You tell me. Do you know any person with whom you can spend your whole life? Without getting bore? You tell me. I'll have to think about it. I need to explore. Discover. You make women sound like a continent. Discover. Explore. Exploit. Colonize. I'm joking. The fact is why would anybody marry me? I have no standing. I'm a struggling actor. But wait and watch. Someday Producers and Directors will queue up in front of my house. All I need is just.. ..One good role. I am confident. Really? Think about it. None of the others are. May I have the last sip? I am returning day after tomorrow. What? The reason I came here is done. What's that? Just like parents forcibly send their children to school.. ..I came to escort my dad to Pakistan. He's been idling for years.. ..In Turkey having set aside his passion. First for mom's happiness.. ..And after her death, for me. He never said one word. But I know he is unhappy. That's why I want him to stay here and start writing again. So, why are you returning? I studied hard so many years. Why would I quit in the final years? Who will look after him? Uncle is here.. ..And I will come occasionally. You'll be missed. Really? Mr. Explorer. Mr. Discover. Can we stay in touch? Give me your number. It's pointless. You won't call and I will wait without reason. Try me. Think about it. "She has taken after you." "Sure, but her eyes are like yours." Dad. What is this? Memories, my dear. I was asking the memories if I should thank them and smile or.. ..Or hold a grudge and get upset. Isn't it possible to do both together? I had a grudge against your mother.. ..For leaving me. And now.. Now I am compelling you to go from here. Mom's departure was not her decision.. ..But this is our mutual plan, isn't it? I will come to see you often. Maybe that way I too will form a bond with your land. This mean I will get have your love in intervals now. Just keep writing these words to me. Then I won't miss you as much. Come back quickly, my dear. I don't have much time left. I just want to see you get married soon. After that you will have to see my kids, kid's kids and their kids. Saniya, my dear. He's a good boy. Take care. Sheheryar are you coming with us to drop Saniya? No, uncle. I came to see you. Didn't you tell me to come spend time with you? So, I thought I'd waste your time today. Wow! My dear, you go and pack your things. I shall talk to my friend. Okay, father. - Come on in. I hope I am not interrupting in your work. Of course not. Maybe this interruption will steer my story elsewhere. In any case, the story writes itself. We are puppets to it. "Blank paper, stares at me" "A pen wanders." "Endless amount of prose and poetry.. ..Flows out of my heart." Did you understand? I have.. ..Returned after many years.. ..Looking for some new and some old ties. You are a drama actor. Yes, uncle. Alone. Looking for a role. Man can find himself in solitude. For nobody reveals himself in a crowd. I have heard you guys read books.. ..When the drama made on it becomes a hit. I am thinking of making a drama out of this. What do you think? Superb idea, uncle. Even your film scripts are memorable. Will you make a drama from my script? Me? Of course. I mean I would love to, uncle. If only I'm lucky enough to get the chance. One does not get a chance, son. One has to snatch the chance. Do it and show me. Meeting with Faisal Uncle was amazing. Who's father is he by the way Obviously But I am serious I will suggest you to think before getting serious I just want you to meet the Director once more. Just wait for five minutes. - Sure sure, why not? Not from here. The casting of extras is going on over here. Sheheryar. Mom. Is everything okay? - Yes, all is well. Actually I came here for an audition. Can you believe it? Audition? Hello Ring ring, heroin ran away? The producer has offered me a role in the next drama. "Wretched mother-in-law and characterless daughter-in-law." Can you believe it? I just could not refuse. But what are you doing over here? I came for a small audition. Nothing major. Why don't you two come to the dressing room? You can speak there at leisure. Yes. - Please come. Okay. What is this, mom? Why? Is it too bright? You are embarrassing me. Does half dad know? Yes. Why are you leaving your comfortable life to get into this struggle? I was getting bored at home. Your friend suggested to act in dramas. Your time will pass. - Oh, for God's.. So, I came. - Acting is a profession. Not a time pass. - I know. But I have nothing else to do in my life. So, relax. You have had your share of adventures. Now just.. Just chill. - Well, that's exactly what I am doing. Just chilling. Quite possibly.. ..This way I could help you in some way. Else this industry? This is all I wanted. Sheheryar, every person needs support.. ..To get someplace in life. Sometimes from loved ones, sometimes from friends.. ..And sometimes even from strangers. That's just the problem, mom. The one whose support was needed.. ..That father left you silently. You got half dad's support, didn't you.. ..But my life was screwed up. Sheheryar, why are you saying that? What else am I supposed to say, mom? I tried to run away from real life to breathe in this make believe life. Today you followed me here as well. As a heroine. While I am an extra. You shouldn't say such things. Why are you saying such things? Listen to me. You need to get married. - Oh, wow! Then you will see a difference in your life. You like brother Faisal's daughter Saniya very much? Thank you very much, mom. Thank you very much. Are you serious? You still feel marriage is the solution for problems? Even if it is not a solution, surely it is a diversion. Please come, Ms. Farida. The Director's here. Okay, I'm coming. See You! I love you. Why? How? I don't know. But I love you. What can one say about love? Love is blind. By sight as well as by brains. What is the problem? My problem is that.. ..You don't have a problem. Hello. Hi. Is everything okay? Yes, everything is okay. Why don't you go and bring my whole family into dramas? I would do it if I had the budget. Anyway, there is no reason to be so upset. He called again. It is a good role. Do it. I told you I refuse to be a corpse. All you have to do is lie down with a sheet on you. The best actresses will come and bang their heads on your chest. The job will last ten episodes. Wow! It's a long role. For a corpse. - Yes. Imagine that. They are paying five thousand rupees. They are paying to lie down? I would lie down anywhere for that kind of money. No! No! No! No! No! I did not mean that. I was.. - My head is spinning as it is. Guys, please leave me alone. What is the matter, Sheheryar? Why are you so upset? Mom. Once again she is obsessed with my marriage. And who is the bride this time? Saniya. Really? So, what is the problem? That is very good news, isn't it? Even you like her, don't you? - Have you lost your mind? Are you intoxicated? I don't want to get married. Exactly! He doesn't want to get married! As it is my situation isn't coming in control.. ..And mom is driving me emotionally crazy. Excuse me! There is no problem for you men in this industry. Marriage is a problem for women. Now I have buy new clothes again Saniya is a nice girl but.. ..It does not mean she wants to get married to me. And what is she does want to marry you? Look. It is her message. I'm telling you this is a sign. Shut up! Whatever! I'm not prepared for long term commitment right now. But you can be friends, Sheheryar. Try to understand the scene. You pan the camera to the right, his mother is ready. You pan the camera to the left, the girl is ready. And if the trailer of this film leaks before it is released.. ..His commitment phobia will.. ..Come out through his nose. Take my advice. Cut Saniya's scene in this film. Look at where the hell it is! If its Saniya then say Yes Disconnect it. Disconnect it. Swipe Right I am going down. He went out. What am I supposed to do if he went out? "The number you are dialing is not answering, please try later" Arshad, is that a sign too? Damn! This boy is still asleep. He spread things all over Brother! Wake up. Wake up, Mohan Pyare. Hashtag, get up! Yes Arshad is driving Sheheryar? Of course Sheheryar is with us. You check up too much. Well, anyway.. Okay, bye. It is Sunday, man! Let me sleep. As though you go jogging on Mondays. Wake up. I have to get dressed up too. Hurry up, Sheheryar. Nowruz is being celebrated at Tanaaz's house today. There are only 20,30 Parsis left in this world and still irritating us. Excuse me. They have called 6 times since morning. I'm tired now. Brother, you get one opportunity in the year to bathe. Don't waste it. Come on. Good boy! Good boy! Calm down, relax, I am going I am going. Don't knock. Done - Get Lost ... I am very happy.

Huh This joke is also three thousand years old Anyway, all of you come here and take a look. Seven items are placed here. All of them begin with the letter S. This is 'Shama.' That means candle. And this is 'Sherbet.' Earlier it used to be 'Sharaab.' Now it is 'sherbet.' - Beverage I don't want needless problems with the Moral Police. And this is S for 'Shirin.' It is a dessert. And this 'Sheer'. That means milk. And we have S for 'Shehed.' Honey. And this is 'Shakkar.' Just like my honey bunny. It starts with an S even in English. Aah! Sugar. And 'Sikka' meaning coins. And finally, this is 'Sheesha.' Meaning mirror. 'Don't ever forget me." Everybody start eating now. Have fun! Aunty, even Tanaaz begins with an S. - How come? - Shweet Heart! Bloody shameless! Flirt! Tanaaz, by this eternal flame.. ..I swear I want you to be my lawfully bedded.. Wedded wife. Will you marry me? I propose a toast to the new couple. Everyday Nowruz Every day should be like Nowruz "Congratulations, Congratulations, Congratulations" "Congratulations, Congratulations, Congratulations" "Congratulations, Congratulations, Congratulations" Look, Sherry. Rustom gave me a distant relative of the Kohinoor. Congratulations Oh! Where is the cake? I'll bring it. Hey! Not now! Not now! Go! Wow! They sent a tiger to protect the lamb. My God! We've lost power. How did this happen? Rustom! - Sorry, aunty Della! Where is Tanaaz? It was a mistake. Where Tanaaz has gone? She never stop at one place. O my God! How did this happen? What happened? Oh, boy! Seven years of bad luck! O my God! What is this? Sorry, aunt Della. I didn't even touch it. I don't know.. No, no. This table is very wobbly. Zarine, can you go get another mirror? Please. Let's all move to the sitting room. We have seven years of bad luck. The mirror broke. Lord knows what will happen. Saniya? Wow! Hi. Hi, Sheheryar. What a pleasant surprise! One could learn how to enchant people from you. Look. Don't disappear I'll be right back. What? She's back. Saniya. She has returned. Hey! Listen to him. Where have you reached? How are you? Sorry. My phone was stolen. Oh! Didn't you think of a better excuse in all this time? This is very lame. The truth is always lame. How do I sweeten it? Incidentally, the thief's timing are better than you. Sania, I really tried to contact you. You blocked me everywhere. Be it friendship or animosity.. ..I know how to discharge my relationships. I have to learn how to discharge from you. Hi Saniya How are you? Saniya! Hi. Hello. - Hello, guys. Sheheryar. Shabbo. Meet Hassan. My fianc*. What? - You.. You.. You have great choice, Saniya! Wow!

I'll put a vermilion spot on your forehead. Let's go. Lets go Hi, Sheheryar. Where did you disappear yesterday? There's a difference between disappearing and not being visible. In any case, I couldn't talk to you yesterday.. ..So I thought today.. - Hi, Sheheryar. How you doing, bro? - Hey. Natasha is taking us out to lunch. Why don't you join us? Oh! No, thanks. I will sit with uncle Faisal today but.. ..You two carry on. I owe you a tour of Karachi. Done. Thank you I am fulfilling one more promise today. Take this. For you. I can't believe this. It's all done? This script was dying for long time to get alive Saniya's mother was sad that she bound the artist within me.. Artist who was arrested by financial chains She did not know that an artist does not die.. ..But rather it lives on with a whimper.. ..Hoping that he might unexpectedly get relief someday. Thank you, uncle Faisal. Go and read it. Your future is hidden in these paragraphs. Thank you! What's the matter? The Doctor has given up on your mother. She is in a coma. Stop worrying. All will be okay. Your mother is exceptional. It does not look like she is acting. Even the coma seems like a full stop. Entirely lifeless. It is natural. Tell me. What are you doing here? Mom woke up from her coma and messaged me to take you to the tailor. Your suit has to be sewn for Rustam's wedding. She is so concerned. But I have decided I will only wear my wedding suit. It has been hanging up for years. What can the tailor do if you are decided? Come. I'll show you around the showroom. A lot of new things have come in. The ratings of Wretched mother-in-law.. ..And characterless daughter-in-law are amazing. Your mother is a great hit! Producers queue up from morning. One role after another. One role after another. Mom has luck along with talent. She worries a lot for you. It's still not too late, son. Come back and give me a hand. I am failing. I'm not a failure. "The armlet keeps getting loose." "The armlet keeps getting loose." How do I look? If you sit on a Jaguar's bonnet, headlights won't be required. Don't taunt me. Tell the truth. Everyone will burn to crisp of jealousy, right? There will be no flame or embers. There's still life left in this old beauty. Why waste money unnecessarily? Not bad. Not bad at all! What? This is the first time I am feeling minority? Come. Let's go inside to watch the wedding ceremony. Everyone is all praise for this wedding. Hello, sir. - Hello. Greetings. Who are you? Where have you come from? You are an infiltrator. A trespasser. Why have you come here? Food, Oh I mean for wedding.. We are here for the wedding. - Wedding? We have the wedding card. Whose wedding? Whose destruction? - Rustom's. Rustom's. Rustom died. Rustom is finished. He died. He was very young. He died. - No, sir. Not that Rustom. Our friend Rustom. You weren't even born when he died. Don't you know he passed away? He went to sleep. He slept forever. He has gone to meet his maker. He has suffered from his Mortal Coil. He is ex-Rustom. He is no more. He's gone. He got out of the photo, entered a frame and got stuck to the wall. He croaked. Croaked. He croaked. Sorry. You can go. Dad, it's time for your pills. Shall we? - Pill. Come here. Come here. Do you know what is behind the pill? Bye-bye. Ok I am going now enjoy enjoy "My heart is unrestrained and free." "Why should someone claim it." "Wild and free, it does as it pleases." "I have kept it protected from being tied down." "Innocent and na*ve, this heart what it desires is challenging" "However, this moment is special my heart beat is locked down" "This poor heart." "Has fallen for you my beloved its chasing you around in circles." "It has awoken again" "It believes this spectacle of the stars is a sign from God." "Why does it always end up falling, For forbidden love." "It always gets hurt taking paths, not meant to be followed" "Don't get tied down yet again O bruised and battered heart of mine" "This poor heart" "Has fallen for you my beloved its chasing you around in circles." "It has awoken again." "It believes this spectacle of the stars is a sign from God." "Don't listen to the silly musings of your heart it only means to delude, my love." "At first, Recklessly falling in love only to regret later." "Let it run free and wild fumbling and tumbling as it wishes." "This poor heart." "Has fallen for you my beloved its chasing you around in circles." "It has awoken again." "It believes this spectacle of the stars is a sign from God." "This poor heart." "Has fallen for you my beloved its chasing you around in circles." "It has awoken again." "It believes this spectacle of the stars is a sign from God." What has Hasan eaten now? I don't know. Anything the poor chap eats.. He does not eat it thinking of his own stomach. Seems like a nice guy. He is. My phone was really stolen that day. That's what the problem is. You give all your performances outside the TV. I bear no grudge, Sheheryar. Lies. How does my drop of a lie matter in your river of lies? Why are you so angry with me, Saniya.. ..That you blocked me everywhere? How is your work? Work? What work? Father wrote something for you, didn't he? Yes. It's a fantastic script, Saniya! I'm totally in love with it. I am looking for a financier. Really? So, you know what love is? You tell me. Are you in love with Mr. Nice guy? Why not? He's smart, he is intelligent.. ..And most importantly he is a sensitive person. Someone who cares about others feelings apart from his own. Saniya. Can't we give this relationship another chance? What do you mean? Give us a little time. Come on! One more chance? And why, Sheheryar? Why would I do that? Coz there is something. There is something between us as well. We should get one more chance to understand each other. Maybe we'll find a way. Hasan isn't running away, is he? And I am not going to run away from him either. And what about the.. ..Unexpressed relationship between us? What am I to do with this unexpressed relationship, Sheheryar? But what more can I say? I don't have a career. I don't have a future. How can I make a commitment? - Shut up, Sheheryar! Just excuses. And you, Saniya. Why do you have this Cinderella complex? Why are you in such a hurry? Mistakes happen. Luck plays games. Can't you give this relationship one more chance? No! I cannot do any such thing because I am in a hurry. Yes! Please. Please do me a big favor! Leave me alone! You're hurting me, Sheheryar. And you're hurting me, Saniya. 'And I am not going to run away from him either.' 'Can't we give this relationship another chance?' 'No! Just leave me alone!' 'You're hurting me' Oh! He's gone! What's the point of living without him? He's gone! He went before his parents. What's the point of living without him? Cut! Excellent, Ms. Farida! Excellent! - Get up! Get up! Get up! - For the next shot, why don't we resume after the lunch? Get up! - Come, Ms. Farida. Your lunch is ready in the vanity van. We shall discuss your next script over there. Will somebody offer water to the corpse as well?! "One does not get a chance, son. One has to snatch the chance." Such great writing, man! It is heart touching. Heart touching. It's done, son. Your job is done. Incidentally, I shall take credit for the writing, okay. Sir. Sir. Sir! Sir, it appears the hero's character.. ..Has been written with you in mind. Wonderful! Wonderful! So, he's a writer. He is not my father. Throw him out. Bloody fool! Yes. - Sir, the script. Oh! The one that you want to Produce yourself, right? My men have read it. It's good. Who wrote it? Sir, a very good old writer, Mr. Faisal Abbas has.. Don't talk to me about these historical. The writing that's been done these days.. ..Is the only thing that people can digest. Yes. Sir, this is the second inning of a very senior writer. Believe me, sir. It will cause a sensation. - Shall I tell you what sensation is? My serials are dubbed and aired in 12 countries. My dramas have broken the TRP records. You see? I won an award just last month. Hence, my boy, don't teach me what a sensation is. Sir, I want to bring my passion into this drama. Leave your passion in your pocket. I merely want the script from you. Because people don't want passion. They want entertainment. The mantra for success is to entertain people. Don't teach them how to live. In any case, what have you done before this? You have the face of a hero. Do a hero's job. Act. Actor, Producer, ticket-collector. You want to be everything? Sir, I.. - I will pay you for the script. Everything is okay. It just requires a few small changes. I will get them done myself. Tell me the number of episodes. 21, sir. - We shall do 45. My team is very fast. They have done 20 scenes in 11 hours. Sorry, sir. It can't be stretched. In that case, my boy, why don't you.. ..Pull the chain in the train and get off? People come out of the woodwork to waste my time. Hello. Hello. Yes, Sheheryar. What is it? Thank you.. ..Dad. For what? For everything. Silly chap. When I taught you to run, why wouldn't I teach you to fly? Best of luck! I'll leave now, uncle. Thank you very much. Uncle what about the money? - What money? I mean for the script writing You want to compensate me. Let's just assume you have made a deposit.. ..And now I shall reap the interest. Just Produce the drama. I won't let you down, sir. Don't let yourself down, son. I ordered pizza. I'll go check on it. Arshad. Arshad. The sofa is here for the new office. Come quick. Please! Okay. Okay. - Come. Come. Hurry up! This.. You? I wanted to apologize for losing my temper. Sit. Personal delivery. My wedding card. I sent sweets to your home. You should have sent salt as well. I'd rub it on my wounds. I want to tell you something else too. What is it? Father is unwell, Sheheryar. His brain tumor is malignant. What? He wants to see me settled before he passes away. And I want to give him this joy no matter what. That's why I.. ..Did not have much time, Sheheryar. But I didn't want to emotionally blackmail you by telling you this. Uncle Faisal didn't mention it either. He does not like anyone feeling sorry for him. Getting married is more difficult than setting up your office. I need help. Shall I send Shabbo? Why? Can't you be my friend? What would I gain? Me. For a few days. In Kashmir. Kashmir? It is dad's wish.. ..That I get married in his ancestral village. Ancestral village? Arshad, look at this. - Why don't you go solve all the problems first? We will make the drama later. Listen to me. - No. No. Go to Kashmir. Go there and shop for the wedding. Get henna applied on your hands. Moreover, be Saniya's girlfriend and play the drums. Also, collect a couple of 'vele' too. Saniya has returned? - Yes, Saniya returns. Just like the horror film. Do you know how much work is required? We haven't organized the audition for the female lead as yet. Production design. Interviews of the cast and crew. But all you care about is being a girlfriend. I cannot say no to her at this time, buddy. In any case, this will only take up two weeks. It takes 2 seconds to lose an opportunity, Mr. Sheheryar.. ..And you have toiled years for this opportunity. Arshad, relax. I see. So, we worked this hard so that when the destination is in front of us.. ..We would relax and go to sleep! Arshad, you are overreacting. I am only being a friend. Are we your foes? You know what? Go and make the drama over there. The father is the writer anyway. Retain the daughter as Director.. ..And Hasan as the Producer! What the hell! Sheheryar, he is correct. Understand your priorities. That's exactly what I am trying to do. What's the matter? I hope you haven't fallen in love. Don't do it. It took me so long to know what love means. It will probably take me a lifetime to forget. Life has rules, Mr. Sheheryar. Life has conditions and destiny is ours. That's why friendship is best. One does not have to depend on either conditions or destiny. I want to tell you something. My dad.. My real dad.. ..Did not love me at all. But I loved him very much. Early one morning a sound woke me up. I was very young back then.. ..But even today I recall that moment like it was yesterday. When I looked down from the top of the stairs.. ..I saw a suitcase next to the front door of my house. Then I saw dad. He was looking at me. That day he had a strange smile on his lips. He picked up the suitcase and left. I never saw him again since that day. A picture of mom and him was around for a few days. Frozen in time. But even that picture was removed after a while. But till date nobody told me why he left us. That's why marriage..the concept of a long-term commitment.. ..Seems very meaningless to me. Because.. ..I my own life taught me something else. Bring one more cup of tea. Oh! Stop it, Arshad. We didn't come here to shoot the last scene of Devdas. And if you love Sheheryar so much.. ..Then why did you fight with him? I got scolded too without reason. Don't be crazy. He is a loser! Why are you acting like a hero? Even you came here when Saniya made one call to you. You just know to talk big. Sorry. Sorry, buddy. I shall pay thousands of rupees for your tea. Producers like you.. ..Always make us suffer losses. Listen. Can we go to buy clothes now? "The shelter sought by the heart, was found on the shore." "Lonely was the heart by itself." "Until it found another like itself." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect." "O my beloved, don't beguile me." "Without words, the eyes have spoken." "Slowly and slowly these hearts connect" "O my beloved, don't beguile me." Aren't you glad we bought the flowers real cheap? Who says the flowers are cheap? The way you were buying like flowers it seemed like it was your wedding. That's why you aren't married. - Get lost. You are very stingy. Sheheryar. Look, I brought more flowers. Put them up. Hey, bro. Stop acting like a girlfriend.. ..Else her children will call you aunt. Stop it. There's a piano behind you, bro. Play it and sing, "I am happy. Ignore the tears." Silence, Arshad. Never mind him, Sheheryar. Just put up flowers over here. They're all bunched up in one place. Put some up over there as well. Sheheryar. Sheheryar. Sheheryar, listen to me. Brother Arshad, I have a problem. Don't take stress. I know a Doctor. He will give you one pill and things will be okay for five to six hours. Oh, no, bro! Not that. - What then? The priest ran off. The priest ran off? Although it's the bride who should have run away. What? I mean to say, why did the priest run away? He's been selected for a game show in Dubai. "I always delay matters." "To do any task." "Whether I have to say something important." "Whether I have to fulfill a promise." "Whether I have to call out to her." "Whether I have to call her back." "I always delay matters." "Whether I have to help her." "Whether I have to console a friend." "Whether I have to go see someone on bygone roads." "I always delay matters." "Whether I have to accustom myself to the changing weather." "Whether I have to remember someone." "Whether I have to forget someone." "I always delay matters." "Whether I have to protect someone before death." "Whether I have to go and tell her." "That the facts were different." "I always delay matters." "I always delay matters." It looks so good on Saniya, doesn't it? Come in. Please leave the room. Now! I hope everything is okay. Saniya. Please marry me. Or I shall die. - No. Please don't do this. It is too late, Sheheryar. Saniya! Open the door, Saniya! - Please go away. Saniya! - Please go away, Sheheryar. Open the door! - I have been trying to go for so long. Saniya! - Please, Saniya. Open the door! - I cannot go on without you. Saniya! Sheheryar. I will convince Faisal Uncle. I will apologize to Hasan. I will grovel and beg him! - Open the door! No. - Please don't do it. Saniya! - Please don't do this. Saniya! Please! Please take a step in my direction! Saniya! Don't stop your steps! Don't do it, Sheheryar. Please! - Please don't do this. Open the door!

Creating a commotion with his first drama wasn't enough for him. According to sources the secret of the chemistry.. ..Between superstar Zeena and him is their blooming friendship. Saniya. - Hi, Sheheryar. Oh, wow! How come you called after all this time? Everything okay? Actually I was busy doing a shot. Oh! I'm really sorry. I was watching you on TV here in Izmir. So, I thought I'd call to congratulate you. Your serial and you have created a commotion. Yes. Uncle Faisal's script was a phenomenal hit. Anyway, let's talk when you're free. Sure. We hear you two are really going to get married after this drama. You know the media is habituated to.. Can I give you some breaking news? Please do. - Please do. You heard right. We have really come very close to each other. And our families are going to meet very soon. You. Bring the camera close. Look at this. This is real. Not a part of the getup. My ring! Why did you have to say that? We will run out of breath now but the media won't run out of questions. Please try to understand, Zeena. I don't want the media making up stories. I did not want it either. That's why I did it. That's not the point, Zeena. It's just the privacy that I.. Shouldn't I be the one saying that? Even Zeena listens to stories every day.. ..About simply being a ladder for your career. But if I'm unafraid of the stories at this stage of my career.. ..Then what are you afraid of? Tell me the truth, Sheheryar. Are you ready for this commitment? I have high regard for your courage, Zeena. I am learning from you how young men face the truth. You're right. I have no reason to be afraid of anyone. Think about it once again. Do you have any regrets? I don't like birds with clipped feathers. The beauty of birds lies in their feathers. If they are clipped what good is the bird? Don't say that, Zeena. You are my choice as well as my inspiration. And most importantly now you are my commitment too. I have reached you after running for years. I no longer want any scope doubts in my decisions. Mr. Chaudhry is here. Mr. Chaudhry. Welcome. We've started promoting your film before its launch. Take a look on Instagram and twitter. The news has spread like wildfire. Fantastic! Fantastic! Ever since I signed you I too have become world famous is all of Chakwal. Tell me this, Mr. Chaudhry. We are coming back to Europe next month to start our film, right? Absolutely. And the wedding sequence. That's in it too, right? That's in too. I was thinking. Why don't we merge fact and fiction.. ..And turn it into a real wedding? He will get his shoot and we will have our destination wedding. Beautiful location. Actor couple. And our families will be extras. Double the entertainment for one ticket. And the climax of your film will get a boost. What an idea, Zeena! You really put your finger on the pulse of the audiences. That's right. And on my Achilles heel. Everything okay? Then why are you so quiet? I'm very sorry, Hasan. Sorry. For what? I can't marry you. This compromise.. ..Which we are trying to change into a bond.. ..I can't do it. Saniya, you see our love as a compromise? There is no love, Hasan. That's why it feels like compromise. Hassan. Why were you in this relationship if you did not love me, Saniya? Perhaps fear. Of what? That nobody would be able to take such good care of me. That is not fear. It is selfishness. Even selfishness is borne out of fear. I might never find a person as nice as you in all my life. But what do I do with this heart.. ..Which loves the truth more than niceness. Hasan, I love Sheheryar. And our relationship. Was it a lie? Believe me. I really tried to make it work.. ..But for some unknown reason.. ..All of this feels like a lie to me. A lie can be fair in love and war, not in friendship. Okay, friend. I release you from my love. When you've learned all these facts.. ..Tell me one more fact. What are you doing over here after learning all of this? Gate crash situation since you are successful You're here? Finally, you thought about your parents. Earlier I used to see you every Sunday.. ..Whereas now I spot you in a magazine every Sunday. Our only son has decided to get married.. ..And we learn it from anti-social media. Why didn't I simply drown in handful of water? Mom, you wouldn't swim in handful of water, so, you certainly can't drown in it. Do you want to challenge her? You be quiet. At least one's luck can drown. I am getting married. I am not divorcing you. Isn't this what you wanted anyway? Stop crying now. It's not good to spill so many tears. My son has grown so big. He is getting married. He is getting married. Hush. Hush. I must admit she is a good actress.. ..But I don't know how she will play the role of a wife. We shall write the script together. We shall keep her away from both, conspiracy and white magic. You can talk to me candidly. Is it coercion, an incident or perhaps a mistake? Oh, no. Nothing of that sort. You love her? Obviously, mom. Why would I marry her if I didn't love her? He is in love. He is in love. Anyway, tell me. What will you wear to the wedding? The Umar Sayeed sari, which I wore in episode 6 of 'Aunty 420.' I got 4000 likes. I got 4000 likes. Congratulations! She has agreed. May God bless her dress! - Amen! Thank you, God! Arshad, please get that. It might be my trousers. Check the string. Otherwise we need to put sneakers laces I became a Director to open doors. Damn! You? Oops! Sorry. You aren't ready. Catching me off guard is an old habit with you. I'll go check in the laundry. Trouser. I am going to check on the frame. - Okay. What brings you here? I came to be a friend. I have to repay the debt. Can I help? Look. I am unable to tie it. Where has Sun gone now? The weather in this country changes every minute. Tell him, so what if this is a real wedding. I cannot change the script at the last moment. Anyone comes along at any time. Go and tell him. Wow! This is the same one from Mera Sultan, isn't it? If it turns out to be another one..! Why are you looking at me in that manner? I am looking to see.. ..If the words you expressed to me were lies.. ..Or did Zeena love you so much, it changed your mind. Regrettably, neither was that a lie.. ..Nor is this a lie. Then why the regret? I should go. How is Hasan? I don't know. Meaning? Meaning it's over between us. Why? Because he knows. What? That I.. That I am in love with someone else. Your trouser. I don't want it! Come over here. Call the gaffer quickly. The light has to be put up. Hey, Turkish Ayesha Omar Give me today's storyboard. Hurry up and bring me tea. You spat into it, didn't you? Lights! Camera! Action! He is stoned. She looks so pretty! Will you look at her? Cut! I need a safety take. Zeena baby is very happy. Only fortunate people have weddings like this. Mr. Chaudhry made all the arrangements. The jewelry as well as the bridal attire. Exactly. No expenses for the video either. The real reception will take place in Karachi. Because our relatives did not come here. Thank God they didn't come. Never mind. A Turkey is a Turkey. Very nice jacket. Versace? - Oh, no. Karachi. I have no secrets from you, uncle. Bought it from charity market Thanks to English man of my size He died at the right time. My child! Go on, my son. Go eat some Baklawa. Good idea. One should get them used to eating Foreign Aid from childhood. Are you from Lahore? - Do you want to go? What are you saying, sir? I am so well-known, so very well-known in Lahore.. ..If you were to enter Bhaati gate, you will find tiny little pebbles. When they see you they will greet you.. ..But don't get scared. No. Never ever! Just ask them where Pabbi, the wrestler lives. Believe me each and every pebble will smile and tell you.. ..Pabbi, the wrestler lives over there. Wow! My son looks handsome! He looked IMF'd. Son, baby is very delicate. Take care of her. Just a minute. Just a minute, aunty. Save this performance for the camera. Good! She thinks she is Mahira Khan. - Rolling. With the mood. Action! When the stars brighten one by one. Your steps come towards my destiny. I hope you remember, Sheheryar.. ..The beauty of birds is in their feathers. These were the only few moments which were free from time's jail. You will be missed Really Mr. Explorer Mr Discoverer Hey! What is he doing? Keep rolling the camera. Don't cut it. Turn camera toward brother in law This is final call to board for Izmir Can we stay in touch? Give me your number! It's pointless.

Hey, cut it! A gun has been fired! Run Run, gun has been fired Stop right now Wow! That was an amazing climax. By the way, we have everything here. We have the stage. We have the priest. We have food as well as witnesses. The lighting is perfect. The frame is perfect. But I am abashed. Well, the couple is perfect, my sweetie-pie. Sleepless eyes, restless body, I will apologise to Hasan this time. This time don't stop yourself from coming in my direction. Zeena knows too. What? That I am in love with someone else. And that wedding? The filmy one took place with Zeena.. ..As for the real one.. Will you marry me? And what if you hide? Come and find me if I hide. I love you very much. I love you more, Saniya.
