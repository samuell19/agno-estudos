What's happening? I don't know. Is everything alright? Yes. Don't worry. They must be looking for somebody. They're just kids. It's a matter of minutes. They'll let us through right away. What about your cousin? When will we see him? I think he had to leave Buenos Aires for a few days. Excuse me, my friend. Do you know when Gasper will be able to see us? The ambassador is in the south until tomorrow morning. He told me he wanted to see you as soon as he came back. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Very well. That's it. We'll be moving right away. You don't have to worry. Car identification. This vehicle belongs to the Swiss embassy's diplomatic service. And these people are here on a tourist visit. 1. THE CAMEL'S TOUR Yvan De Wiel. Can I see your passports? Geneva! Switzerland! We can speak in French, if you wish. With pleasure. This place is beautiful. - Looks like the Beau Rivage, right? - Yes. Did you have a nice trip? Marvellous. We were delayed when we arrived in the city. Oh, there are many road works. The government has started extensive work to modernize it, due to the World Cup. And they've been celebrating the national team's victory since then. That's right. Two years of partying! The government has high ambitions. You have to understand... The situation was awful here, The country needs major reforms. I see. The swimming pool's on the first floor. Did you find it? Without any problem. It's like being in Europe. Many people in the street. It's impossible to guess what's happening in the country. My cousin just called. So? He's meeting us tomorrow. He sounded glad you'd arrived. The way he spoke, he seems relieved Keys left. - What did he say? - Not much. - Were there any complaints? - Just claims, I think. - From whom? - I don't know, Quinet. He just said your partner had built a reputation for being depraved. Depraved? You're exaggerating! That's what he said. He invited us to a reception on the 20th. The minister will be there. And other people who may be interesting. - What about this one? - What does he do? Former motor racing champion. Retrained himself in the industry. I think he wants to enter politics. Anibal Farrell. Irish? You'll look too snobby in that. Try something more garish. Cream. Something worse, to give them more confidence. Don't you have a double-breasted one. It emphasizes your shoulders. This is my wife, Ines. Do you speak Spanish? - Yes of course. - Let me buy you a drink. - With pleasure. - This way, please. It was a long trip, right? You must be shattered. Did you have a stopover? Madrid, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires. Damn it! Do you know Europe, Mr. Dekerman? Not yet. Boy, bring me a whiskey. - Madam? - Tea, please. - First time in Argentina, right? - The first time this far south. - Mineral water. - Of course, sir. So... Are we waiting for Mr. Farrell? No. He's had a problem. He's not coming. He sends his apologies. - Did you meet Keys, Mr. Deckerman? - Yes. Yes, I met him. You've got a different style, right? Mr. Dekerman... I'd like to meet Farrell. Farrell only cares about his horses. You could go and meet him at the racecourse, if you want. You were very good, Quinet. Farrel is the typical tough client. We don't know each other. He's testing me. It's a classic. It will come. They're the ones who need you. It’ll take some time. Especially when the client sends his lawyer. Dekerman is extremely rude. Imagine what the clients like. You'll have to try harder than usual, Quinet, to reassure them. They're used to him. Keys was very charming. Charming? He's twisted, and uglier than a toad. He'd been coming for a long time, that's all. Very well, very well. And you? We arrived today. Yes, today. It's always a bit long, but everything's fine, thank you. Yes, yes. Good, good. What time? 9... 9 p.m. Subtitle Arms. Can you give me the address, please? Corrientes... Pardon? Keys is fine. He's very well. We haven’t contacted him so far but we know he's fine. I understand. Yes, don't worry. There won't be any changes. We'll follow the same path. Hello? I'd like to phone Switzerland. The number is 0041 22 28 00 42. Thank you. Bijou. How are you? Did I wake you up? Well, so do I. DOLLAR OVER 10,000 PESOS - How are things in Geneva? "Gold goes down and dollar goes up". Excellent. Can you write it down now? So... Ciba, sell. In the best case. Aibis... Buy at 400. Right. And Belimo, sell at 250, but wait... Since when haven't you heard from him? - About a month ago. - Have some salad, Ines. - Bijou spoke to him on the phone. - I don't know who Bijou is. Sorry, she's my secretary. She's in charge of the transition. She was the last to talk to him after coming back from Geneva. - Is he in Switzerland? - Yes, probably. Bijou says he's alright. We've had no news since then. It's a sensitive issue. You don't just leave this country right now. I need to be certain Keys is not locked in a basement in this city. Otherwise, I must first deal with the militia in charge of external affairs, and then with Bern. He's not in Buenos Aires. - I can guarantee that. - But then, what's happened? We don't know. Nothing makes me feel better than not having someone like Keys around anymore. The situation is quite unpredictable this way. But I must warn you there are many rumours. Ines told me about some complaints. Did I say "complaints"? I think I said "comments". - No, I think you said... - They're rumours! Neither comments nor complaints. Rumours! And here, at this moment rumours are a problem. Anyway, let's forget about Keys. So... To your journey! At last you’re doing this tour. How do they call this in private banking? This initiation rite... "The camel's tour." "The camel's tour." I did it long ago. All right. But you're going to change your status. We're at the frontline here. Come to the reception on the 20th. I'll introduce you to some people. - Will it be at your house? - No, it's too small. We don't even have a pool. A member of the Swiss club of Buenos Aires will lend us his house. Over the years , this party has become a very exclusive event. Excuse me. Was it really necessary for her to come with you? We're used to taking this sort of trip together. The clients like her. Do you think this is Roland Garros? Anyway... Tell me... Did you know Keys had a flat here? He never stayed at a hotel. He had his own flat. We took him there once with Francoise. It's in Palermo Chico. It'd be regrettable if there were names going around. I can tell Dante to take you there. I hired a second chauffeur, recommended by the Indian ambassador. I don't know his real name. Everybody calls him Dante. He's a terrible driver, but he does us some very valuable... favours. Puree? Thank you. 2. THE VISITS My daughter went to Rosier School. Is it in Caux? Or Morges? Rosay Academy? In Rolle. ...but the Hotel Alvear is better located. And it has all this luxury... - And in winter, in Gstaad. - Anyway... - Anita! ...it's a lovely city. - You have no idea... - Do you know Gstaad? ...what this city was like a few years ago. We have a chalet in Saanen. But we're undergoing a significant decline. We are neighbours of Lobkovitz's son It's still one of the best cities in the world, but it has lost a great deal. - My daughter was in class with Franziska. - Do you know Paris well? - You know Franziska? - The cadet? No. I haven't had time yet. The military career is very demanding. - Ah! Are you a soldier? The prince. Poor man, so pale. Now I'm in the import-export business. My daughter called him "Chambourcy". ...at the moment especially in the leather sector.. My daughter is terrible! Excuse me. Oh! Agapanthus! Agapanthus. What a nice word! Ines, do you want to see the garden? I'll go with you. Come on. So? Is Guido amusing you? How much do you value his potential? Your partner is a very interesting person, Mrs. Lacrosteguy. "Partner". He's very kind to me. Your French is really admirable, madam. All good things are lost, unfortunately. How's your daughter? My daughter? You were just talking about her with my wife. Is she still comfortable in Switzerland? Bibi lives in New York, but now she's here. You'll meet her. Once again, I appreciate that you have received me and my wife. Ines loves travelling. Your wife is charming. We have so many acquaintances in common. that we could even be cousins. We have a lovely house in the heights of Vandoeuvres. You're cordially invited. Didn't you know I don't want to travel anymore? It has been an honour to receive your visit all these years, madam. - If the bank can help you... - Times are tough now. Times are tough. And the departure of Rene... of Key's, your partner This is embarrassing for me. Madam... On behalf of the Keys Lamar De Wiel Bank, I apologize. - Keys' attitude is deplorable... - No, Mr De Wiel. Come and sit here. Your partner left at a very bad time. Some of the things happening here these days are scary. Yes, I understand. The violence of the extremists is awful. I'm talking about something else. Something much more serious which has to do with the upper echelons of power. You and I are in the spotlight. We're in the spotlight. They're chasing us like rabbits. They're after us. Rene Keys often reassured me. He used to travel with me. I understand. A horsefly! Damn bug! - Is everything alright? - Yes. Do you know who I met playing tennis? Toribio. - Really? - Yes. - As divine as usual. - Did he say hello? Yes, of course. Obviously. We talked for a while. He told me he'd resumed horse training with his father. They're there. next to the racecourse. - Oh good. - Yes, lovely. Good thing Harold is coming only next week. He's so jealous he would have made a terrible fuss. Be careful what you say in front of our new friends. Don't give a bad image of your husband. Do you know what he also told me? Do you remember Perez? They went to his house and took everything from him! They went with three lorries and even took his horses away, mama. Mr. De Wiel, aren't you going to swim? No, thank you. Mama, did you hear me? - They took everything. - Stop! My husband never swims. Thanks. So glad you came, Mr De Weil. It's a pleasure. It's very important for my mother. When we flew, Rene would take care of everything. He would book the Tuesday flight. It was wonderful. Nobody ever asked anything. Rene knew exactly what to do. And on the plane, I would sleep the whole journey to Geneva. I was... relaxed. At peace. After arriving in Geneva, we would go for a last drink at a lovely café, Café Clémence, right below the cathedral. Rene liked that gin... An English gin. Gordon's gin. It was some kind of ritual, to celebrate a victory. I guess I was happy. We had some games, such as: when we were getting close to the customs office, any customs office, at the airport, at Cornavin station... I would start singing a song and Rene would finish it. And we would laugh. It was easy, because he knew many songs, and I like to sing. And we would laugh together. He used to say: "Custom officers smell fear, just like dogs, but they don't suspect happy people." Wait. You can go up now. Second floor. Can I turn on the lights? Don't be long. He was scared of something. We don't know, Ines. So you're telling me he left all his things. His room was untidy. He must have left suddenly. - It's not really his style. - No. What's his flat like? It's a maze. There are lots of doors. Did you find anything? A calendar. His schedule of meetings? Scribble. The calendar mentions a meeting, right before he left. On November 20th, he wrote "Lázaro". "Lázaro". Who's that? No idea. The same as on the list. What list? The one I found under the leather protector. It's just like mine, but with this Lázaro added. Could he be a client? Perhaps. Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady, my dear. Don't be afraid. Steady. It gets scared of rats on the ground. These trees were planted by my great grandfather in order to unify the different parts of the property. My father took care of them. He calls them "Les Grands Boulevards". But little remains today of Haussmann's greatness of that time. You must know France perfectly well, Mr. Padrel-Camon. Right? I even had the privilege of taking a nap in Paris, madam. The black one is hobbling around. My wife must have come back. She hardly goes out anymore. Regrettably, the situation calls for it. This country has become a private hunting ground for some people at the top. Augusto! We're coming. I'm going. De Wiel, I want to talk to you for a minute. How's your good notary Blanchard doing? Wonderfully. You know he worships you. Just like his own father did. - Listen, De Wiel... - Call me Yvan, please. On the phone, you mentioned a solution. For transport? Of course. Mr. Decôme. He's here at the moment I'm meeting him this week. What's that Decôme like? A stand-up guy? Absolutely stand-up. He's a former partner of the bank. An old man, a great friend of my father's. He became fond of Buenos Aires. Fine. Shall we open the account in your name, sir? No. Wait until we decide how to proceed with this matter. Tell me, De Wiel... Keys is not coming back, is he? I apologize on behalf of the Keys Lamar De Wiel Bank... A house like ours takes 200 years to build its reputation. Rene Keys doesn't accept his responsibilities. It's regrettable. Don't blame Keys. He's a good man. Keys knew me well. He knew perfectly that my head is not in business. The disappearance of my daughter Leopolda took me away from all this. The two sons I have are useless. Always so jealous of Leopolda! They plan to sell the arable land and build a country club on the rest. A country club! Look at them. They look like idiots. Their mother pampers them too much. Two chubby calves. They only speculate. They only think about money. Dad, come here! Help yourself. - What was his wife's name? - Magdalena. She's in charge of the Miss Foal pageant for Tandil's annual feast. - It's funny. - Very. She teaches the girls good manners, she teaches them to chat. - Is she "unce"? - I think she is. She inherited from her father a country house in Marbella, next to the Bismarks. She's related to a Spanish count, Salamanca or some such. We'll have to go and visit them there. And what do you think about the sons? The youngest is a "boget". No potential. The other is trying to get a place in a ministry. And him? He's getting old. He's staying with us. - Did you hear about his daughter? - Yes. The poor man is devastated. - Did he tell you about it? - Hardly. Magdelena made a strange comment about Keys. It's a bit confusing. We were talking about a minor issue and I mentioned Keys in passing, talking about you or our trip here. She stopped me at once. She said you seemed a very good man, very correct, that she could see it in your face. Whispering, she added that Keys was nothing but a despicable manipulator. That he was dangerous. It's only hearsay. Prudery, Ines. Augusto may think just like his wife. He spoke of Keys as a friend. And he doesn't seem to have many friends. But what did he do, Quinet? She said "dangerous". Hello, Bijou! Fine, fine. And you? Am I disturbing you? Aren't you having lunch? Well! Here it's awfully hot. Look, I've got a bag with me. Decôme will take it next week. Yes, that's right, it's for him. No, we'll wait to see how they want to proceed. Can you do me a small favour? Check the list of pseudonyms. See if there's a "Lázaro" somewhere. That's right. L-A-Z-A-R-O. Just check if he's got something with us. I'll call you back. Thank you, dear. Bye. Bye. 3. A DUEL At last! De Wiel! - Mr. Farrel. - How are you? Very well. My wife. Have you seen the horses? What do you think? They're lovely. Especially number 5, "Usurper". Except for its name. But it's a really lovely horse. One minute, De Wiel. No women. Darling, why don't you go and bet a bit? On horses. Gentlemen, excuse me. De Wiel, we could go to the fifth floor. We have a box. We could discuss some issues there. Do you have time? Fine. Let's go. De Wiel, please help yourself. You're making me thirsty. Thanks. It used to be much easier, when I bet on me. Anibal won Nürburgring with Ferrari twice and the Brazilian Grand Prix with Mercedes once. - Dekerman, have you been served? - No. Nacho, can you tell Pataroni I'll see him later downstairs? Yes, sir. Don't leave me alone, Farrell. Pataroni. We'll meet later downstairs. Can't you see I'm with my Swiss banker? Look. Nice to meet you. They told me you have a very big castle in Geneva. We have a very big house, from our family. You're welcome there. How many hectares are we talking about? Compared to what you're used to, it's just a small garden. What did you do before becoming a private banker? Well... My grandfather was a founder of the Keys Lamar De Wiel Bank. Consolidated by my father, of course. I'd never have guessed that. Dekerman, please, close the door. So... De Wiel. Tell me what you propose. You have 5 minutes. No, no. I'm joking, De Wiel. When we worked with Miradela Motors, in the USA, we did this with the people of Mac Kinsey. They were... expeditious. I like that, I value that. They had three pillars: the Marines, the church and themselves. They're actually friends of your partner, I think. Rene Keys has got many friends. The management model I can propose is very similar to what Keys has. There may be some small differences between him and me, let's say... in style. Mr Nazarian is looking for you. Nazarian... He was with the minister. I forgot. De Wiel, I'm leaving you with my lawyer, to sort everything out. I'm leaving. When are you going back to Geneva? I have a few days left. Okay, I'll see you before you leave. Bye. I'll go with you. Us too? The military are a bit restless lately. Listen. It's nothing personal. Don't torture yourself. The decision had already been made. Keys and Farrell were very close. I think Farrell has shit his pants too. He worshipped your friend, like the drug addict who sucks the dealer's cock. I'll keep you posted. "God's Fervour" finished seventh. What a pity. How's Anibal and his elephants? Farrell is leaving the bank. Are you sure? Did he tell you why? He doesn't have to. - And what are you going to do? - What am I going to do? Dekerman says Farrell had made the decision long before we arrived. Farrell has got "two yolks". He's older than you, and he dresses like he was a law student. Can't you see he's a "deusse"? Those people think they can buy anything. The new generation's aggressive. That's what they're asked. Enough, Ines! Your father was right. Fear makes you mediocre. How are you my friend? You look pale. Decôme... Excuse me. I'm exhausted. Are you sure you're okay? Have some sugar. An orange juice. No, I'm fine. You were telling me about the sale. Yes. The minister couldn't refuse the purchase offer. This electric company was a thorn in Bern's side. We must admit that Credit Suisse was able to negotiate really well. What was their representative's name? Lutz. A good Swiss, from Zug. He's staying at the Sheraton with Lombier's son. Between you and me: since credit banks started sailing in the same waters as we do, a real war of greed has broken out. It's not the same world we knew with your father, Yvan... Regrettably, I agree. Anyway... Fydmer is delighted with the finance minister's attitude. In fact, we will meet at Fydmer's on the 20th, won't we? oh, no. I'm returning the day after tomorrow. Ludivine is getting married. Congratulations! Do we know the lucky man? A Chalignac. The poor devil is not very bright, but he seems to be a hard-working lad, anyway. - Ah, here it is! - My secretary has been warned. I'm grateful you took care of the transport. It's only natural, son. I'm happy to help. By the way, you look great. And you? How do you feel here? It must be different from Geneva and Paris. Herman Cortes must have also felt a bit disoriented when he disembarked. I've got an appointment in an important club in a little while. Really? Which one? The Circle of Arms. Act as simple as you can, my dear. You have to tug those people's heartstrings. Have you seen the inflation? And not only that. Here people constantly live in fear of what may happen tomorrow. The Circle of Arms. That's good. The cream of the junta meets there. Be alert all the same, son. It's been a pleasure seeing you. Shall I help you? No. Give Ines my regards. Of course. A client has invited her to dinner tonight Very well. You are going fast, my friend. That's great. As for Keys... It's not a comfortable situation. Your father would never have allowed such indolence. No offence. People behave differently now, as you said. This will not benefit you. Keys was brilliant. Probably one of the best among us. But so much exuberance was toxic. After spending so much time here, his methods became... problematic. There are dreadful... rumours. Someone trustworthy saw Keys with certain people... beasts. We all have a breaking point, I guess. Keys has completely lost his mind. What a waste. So much talent, and such a fall. Welcome to the Circle of Arms, Mr. De Wiel. If you want the bar, it's at the back of the main room. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Good evening. You must be the famous Swiss. I didn't know I was so famous. Water, please. Look who's arrived. His holiness Tatoski. Excuse me. Mr. De Wiel? It's so nice to meet you, my friend. So nice! The pleasure is mine, Monsignor. - Inchauspe. - Yvan De Wiel. - Captain Peraltchuk. Nice to meet you. - Yvan De Wiel. - Ambassador Damestoy. - Yvan De Wiel. Garrel. Nice to meet you. Amadeo Casten. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Adolfo Nelson. - Where are you from? - Geneva. Borges. Sure. Geneva is Borges' favourite city. - Do you know why Borges likes Geneva so much? Because it's a city that hasn't changed. So, when he goes there, wherever he is, he can recognise... Yesterday I had lunch with a colleague of yours. Lutz, from the Credit Suisse. Really? Yes. You're really tough for business. We don't exactly share the same line of business. What do you mean? Aren't you a banker too? Rogelio, you're offending Mr. De Wiel. Mr. De Wiel belongs to private banking. It's different to commercial banking. It's like comparing an airliner to a private jet. Gentlemen, our friend here is a man of the world. He comes from a lineage. However, a commercial banker is nothing but a mere slave to his bank. Look, with all respect. after dealing with the Swiss for a while, you'll realise who's really a slave. - You see how things are getting! - You sure you wanna get into this? He didn't look like a slave. Don't listen to them, Yvan. They're like children. Mr. Die Wiel is a great banker. He's the partner of our friend, Rene Keys. Shall we take a walk around the circle? Ruben, be nice. Take him on the guided tour. The creation of the Circle of Arms took place thanks to 78 gentlemen, all of them amateur fencers, at a time when duels were rife. The main initiative came from Mariano Paunero, son of the general Wenceslao Paunero, a colossus of the War of the Triple Alliance and the liberator of Corrientes. The circle had among its members some of the greatest men of the nation: Carlos Pellegrini, Julio Argentina Roca, both Uriburus, Manuel Quintana Figueroa Alcorta... to name some of the presidents of the republic. As for illustrious visitors, we can mention Anatole France, the Duke of Windsor. Unfortunately, nowadays the fencing piste has been replaced by a squash court and a sauna... He's a patriot! Do you see how much he knows? He's something of an institution in the Circle. Adolfo! - Come here. - Yes. Excuse me. The city was in chaos, my friend. Since then we're going through a purification phase. Now we must re-educate all the young people. But, unfortunately there are some unrecoverable elements. Parasites must be eradicated. even in the best of families, don't you agree? Yes. You're different to Keys. - Keys has probably got less... - You're... ...more reasonable, humbler. He said we were all murderers. Have you had dinner yet? Let's go to the bridge room. Let's buy Hoffman-Laroche. The stocks are at 82.75. Hoffmann-Laroche. Increased on average. Order 200. - Very well. Limited? - Unlimited. Limiting it to a week would provide more guarantees. It's not necessary. Caterpillar, buy. They're up 700. You know and I know they're expensive. You have a call, Monsignor. - Who is it? - Captain Grossini. Tell him to call again later. - Care for a drink? - No, thanks. Here they have that dry gin, Gordon's. Keys drank it. He said it was the best of them all. Okay, a gin. Listen, my friend... Uganda. What do you know about that? The coup came out of nowhere. Nobody thought Obote would come back. Uganda? Indeed. He was finished. The schilling is very fragile. Let's open a Forex contract. The Forex? Monsignor, the Forex is a particularly complex operation. And of high risk. "Let's be greedy when others are prudent." Keys used to say that. How much are you thinking about? 1.5 million. I want to be honest with you. I think there's a very high possibility that you will lose the money you invest there. We have no interest in operating in the currency market. It's a totally unpredictable market. War is won on the front. It took a lot to convince him too. Did Keys operate in the Forex? Have you already done it with him? Pastimes are rare in these turbulent times. Your predecessor knew how to be exceptionally generous. As far as he could be. You... Did Keys inform you of the reasons for his sudden departure? Anyone has the right to get scared. Even the best of them. Do you know a certain "Lázaro"? Lázaro? That was probably too much for Keys. Sure. Anyone can get scared with Lázaro. We're talking about serious business. I don't want to push you, but... If I were you... You're on a trip, and trips are usually entertaining. Now the country needs people like you. Brave people. We mustn't forget we had to go out and clean the streets. We live in difficult times. Dark times. 4. THE GALA We also say to do "condois". To do "condois"? My husband does it very easily. It means "pretending you haven't seen anything". I love dialects! My husband and I use it, some cousins, the world of private banking. It's a limited dialect. And the other one... "Cousin Arthur"? No, "play cousin Antoine". For example, I see your partner among the guests. We're pretty far away. I see him but he hasn't seen me yet. I have the possibility of ignoring him. For whatever reason, I prefer not to say hello to him. I don't meet his eye. I played "cousin Antoine". It's very practical. You're brilliant! One more, my dear! "Play the monkey with a golden mouth". Play the innocent. I like this one. "To have two yolks". When someone cannot be trusted. we say that he has two yolks. And... "Azor". "Azor"? "Be quiet". "Careful what you say". Yvan! Are you alone? Momentarily. Good. Is Ines having fun? I think so. Mrs. Urzue Talaman! Welcome! Yvan De Wiel. My cousin's husband. Nice to meet you. - Your first time in Argentina? - Yes, the first time. You must see the Rio de la Plata. It looks like an ocean! Of course. A great ancient fortune... went broke. A great radio drama actress. Lombier is here. With Lutz. Have you seen them? From afar. Mr. Padel-Camon. Your husband is a gem. An honest man. He loves you, my dear. You support him a lot, don't you? As one of my close friends says, My husband and I are one and the same person: Him. I get so bored... You have no idea how much. It's a divine punishment. Magdalena? Good evening. You've made a mistake. I'm not Magdalena. I'm her sister. Alicia Domecq. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. You're so alike. It's amazing. Don't worry, I'm used to it. A little less now, since I don't live here anymore. And where do you live? Paris. And Marbella, Madrid... We have a small herd. Bulls. - The party is livening up, De Wiel. - Yes. - It's a lovely party. - Yes, lovely. There's a question they must be asking you a lot. What do you think of Argentinian meat? Is it better or worse than others? It's as good as any other, isn't it? It's excellent. Well, De Wiel. Open the account in the name of my daughter, Leopolda. Sir... Legally, the holder cannot be an absent person. I mean, it has to be someone who can sign. But she has to be able to dispose of her money, in case she reappears. It's crazy! What a shitty country! In such particular cases, the bank makes available transfer accounts. That could solve the problem. Fine, but don't let my wife and sons know. My sister leads a life that's very different to mine. Poor her, they were very dark times. When his daughter Leopolda disappeared, Augusto was on some land in the south of the country. Augusto became aggressive with his people. He was mad with grief. Leopolda was his darling daughter. He had a lot of expectations for her. He knew she was a member of a political group and they argued a lot about that, but Leopolda was stubborn. Like her father. Augusto doesn't tolerate any weakness, you know. Oh, De Wiel! - So nice to see you. - Mr. Dekerman. I like you. Your colleague, though, was a fanatic. - Did you cross Farrell? - No. Do you want me to tell you? The whims of people like Farrell are trying my patience. I'm not as dedicated as some of you. Farrell is not a bad guy. Ambition is his problem. Now he wants to belong to high society. To be a politician. An idiot. Besides, he's paranoid. Yvan! A little meeting. You might have fun. Gentlemen. Yvan de Wiel. From the Keys Lamar De Wiel Bank. He's part of the family. Lutz, go on. Excellent. Shall we start? But not now. 9th of July. We'll organise them a nice parade. That's very good, it's a good possibility. - Salati has to get in there. - Surely. So Yvan... Are you sightseeing? I won't bother you any longer. A honeymoon is consummated in private. It seems that Keys left everything incomplete. He must have left you a huge schedule. Do you listen behind doors, Guy? I don't even have to. But tell me: it seems Keys hit the mark. "El Dorado! At last!" Right? What did they call it? "Lázaro"? Are you interested? We don't go there, you know. We don't need to stoop to that. If you want to enjoy a decent swimming pool, I'm at the Sheraton until the 10th. You're very kind, Guy. Please, Yvan. - Take care. - You too. Keys is ahead of me. He's always ahead of me. He's irreplaceable. Quinet... They miss him, Ines. He sold his soul for them. He was brilliant. I'll end up humiliated. On the contrary, Yvan. You're going to get where Keys never got. You just need to keep quiet. 5. LÁZARO LÁZARO ISLAND MILITARY ZONE Yvan De Wiel? Manchado? He went to get the inventory. He's on his way. The 603 is arriving, with two units. Manchado is with them. We'll be right back. They're thoroughbred racehorses. Section 4: 1,826 suitcases, 11,132 plastic combs, 658 electric shavers, 5,674 metal and plastic glasses, 178 blenders, 2,784 refrigerators, 68 old kerosene stoves, 234 table fans, 674 sewing machines, 1,435 black and white televisions, 65 colour televisions. Section 5: a Chevrolet pick-up model 1968... The cars aren't here. They're at the warehouse. And why didn't you tell me? Section 6: 1 French silver tea service, 1 wall clock, probably from the 19th century, 3 Persian wool carpets, hand-woven, 16 French chandeliers, 14,876 Dupont lighters, 1 Mauser rifle, from the Paraguayan War, 9 silver and gold creole knives, 1 old edition of "Don Quixote of la Mancha", 1 Bible from 1400 written in Latin, restored, 1 bilingual dictionary of 7,000 pages, 1 Santos Hernandez guitar, dated 1924, 1 Francisco Simplicio guitar, dated 1927, not in good condition. Section 8: - A capybara leather jacket. - This isn't here, either. Section 9: An offset printing machine model 130, a double craft Rotaprint, a standing stapler, 400 fruit baskets, 1,007 synthetic fabric rugs, 657 portable record players and 7,467 leather belts. Why are the leather belts here? This is a 1960 Alfa Romeo. A very good car. In very good condition. Very good. This one, we had to paint it. We had some issues. And you can show the property titles, I guess. Yes. Yes, of course. Very impressive. Very good, gentlemen. We're not an auction house. But we can adapt when it's worth it. Should we reach an agreement, we can coordinate the transport of the goods you'd like to take out of the country. In Geneva there are companies that specialise in such movements, and which are particularly discreet. As for things that should be sold here, we can also supervise, if necessary. - But I don't think it's the most advisable. - No! So we are in agreement. We'd take care of managing the sale proceeds. We only work with commissions. That's to say, a percentage of the deposited money. In general, that commission ranges from 2 to 3%. In this case, given the characteristics of the business, we should raise that amount. I'd say... ...5% Okay. Do we have any idea of the inventory value? From what I've seen, off the top of my head... I think it's near 600 million. Very good. Very good. And do we have to sign anything? Not yet. Okay. Very good. Nice to meet you, Mr. De Wiel. It's been a pleasure, colonel.
