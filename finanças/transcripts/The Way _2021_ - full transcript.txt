How's the wife, Frank? Frank! You alright? I gotta tell you something, Rich. The whimpering gets to me, man, thinking this is going to be the last one. - I got kids, you know. - And? So do I. It's the job, Frank. That stuff we saw earlier's not supposed to happen. And if they keep screwing the doses up like that, the warden's gonna get the axe himself. I hear it's like being put on fire when the poison hits and you're not out. The fires of hell. Is that so, preacher? Yes, it is, boss. It ain't right, it ain't humane. Tell that to the family of the murdered. Evil's punished in the fires of hell. Yeah, and Jesus is coming. Yes, he is. Don't listen to him, Frank. That's just compassion you feel. That's a good thing. Tomorrow they're pricking a real beauty. She is something special, alright. Hope he goes easy on her, no burn or anything. Is that love I hear? No, man. She's just really nice, you know? Lord's justice will be done. What justice? You think you know what justice is? Yeah. You kill, you die. Like, uh, revenge? Isn't that a sin, Bob? It's the law. Yeah, so was slavery. What's got you all in a tizzy, boy? I'm not your boy. And you ain't got the market cornered on what's right and what's wrong. - The Lord does. - Yeah? And you're his goddamned spokesperson, huh? Don't you ever take the name of the Lord in vain. I'll kick your goddamned ass. Come on, motherfucker, I'll teach you some motherfucking manners. Calm down! We're a team here. Now, relax. Just last day jitters. Keep it together, alright? We've got a job to do. Don't worry about it, Mack. It's okay. Yeah. Sure, Frank. I'm going to go call in the cage. What's up with him? The devil's got a grip on him, that's what's up. She was something special. Gathering yang, heavenly chi. Inhale... exhale. Fingers together, place on your dan tien. As you bring the chi into your dan tien, energy increases. Drop by drop, the puddle becomes an ocean. Raise hands up... open to hold ball position. Focus on your dan tien. Feel the energy. That's some bullshit. You see that? Manners. What the fuck are you doing? Are the first steps in completing your circle. You better step off. I don't want to break you. Only the rigid can be broken. Alright, that's solitary for you two ladies. I do believe this is Ms. Arc's sixth violation. Yes, it is. Six weeks in the hole for you, Jane. May the Lord's justice be done. And I expected better from you, Xin. Mr. Hill, Mr. Johnson. I was simply teaching my student a lesson in grace. Come join us, so we can continue. Mr. Hill, Mr. Johnson. Are we letting this happen? - It already has, Bob. - Oh, this is bullshit. It already has. When there is total relaxation, there is an opening. Purify your heart, clarify your intentions. Chi is everywhere. You are in chi, chi is in you. Again, from the beginning, drawing in chi. Reverse breathing, inhale... exhale. Gathering yang, heavenly chi. Inhale, exhale. Place fingers together. Place on your dan tien. Hold ball, out. Hold ball, out. Focus on your dan tien. Put your hands up. Step back. Open number nine. Why you gotta cuff her, man? That ain't right. That's not fucking right! Give 'em hell, Jane! Jesus Christ! Didn't you lock those? Get the cuffs! Damn it! That woman is the devil! Come on, Jane. Keep it moving. Strip down. And your shoes. Turn around, face the wall. Bend over. Spread your legs, spread your cheeks and cough three times. Turn around, face me. Lift up your arms. Let me see in your mouth, bottom lip, top lip, under your tongue. Get dressed. Inmate's ready. Howdy, Alice, Reverend. Richard. Prison 1608, Jane Arcs. Sign this. Hello, Ms. Arcs. I'm Father Ross. Open your heart to the Lord and forgiveness is yours. You have a gift, Father. And a very good heart. Thank you for your good work. Uh, yes. Thank you. Let's go. Claude, did Jane get... Hands up. Open outside. Open inside. I will return to you soon. I've got first shift. I got second. See you tomorrow. Yo... You better check yourself with that attitude, B. Remember, I gave you your shot. otherwise, you'd just be another fucking trick. Am I not a killer? What? The fuck are you talking about? Did I break your nose when you offered to be my pimp? What? No pity comebacks? Do you, do you understand what the fuck... what the fuck I've provided you in this fucking game? You would have nothing without me. What the fuck? - You are an evil motherfucker. - You haven't earned shit. - Uh-huh? - I earn it for you. I'm just saying, respect. Yeah. Respect. Hey, my guys. How are you? Everything good? Thank you, business as usual. Go ahead. Ah! Money! Oh, she's out. Let's get this mess cleaned up. Next fight. You got this? Just got a text from my man that said, Jake just died, don't let her do this. Don't fuck with me. Alright, well... Gotta make sure my money's right. Know what I'm saying? You got this. You are the new fucking champ. She is old news. 'Cause you know I'm trying to... get into that ass tonight. Fuck you. You fucking murder her. You murder! Ever. Whatever. Louder! Louder! Let's go! I know you wouldn't stay away. You're Killshot Jane. - Who? - Me. - Who? - I'm the fucking bitch just won. This is Killshot Jane! Killshot Jane! Killshot Jane! Ready? Killshot Jane! Killshot Jane! Now do what you do and go execute this fucking bitch! Go! All right people, bets are closed. Welcome to the main event. In the left corner, we've got Vicious Vera, the reigning champion. She been ripping people to pieces for months. And out of retirement, the former champion, Killshot Jane bringin' it back for one last fight. All right, bring it in. Let's see what we got. Now listen up, there's only one rule: no weapons. Other than that, I'll stop the fight when the fight is done. Got it? Back to your corners, let's go. Gonna rip you apart, little girl. Ding, ding. You're getting soft. All you got? Huh? Fucking bitch! Come on, Jane. What are you doing? Get up. Jane, what the fuck are you doing? Jane! Jake, Jake. I'm coming. Who the fuck is Jake? What are you doing? Fuck Jake, fuck Jake. Fuck. Yeah, you iced her. Come on, we gotta get out of here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I knew it. I knew it, Killshot 'til the end. That's my baby girl. I love making money with you. You were mumbling to yourself. Is that so? Yeah. Light sleeper? You would know. It's all dialed. Just be ready. Midnight, before the next shift change. No. What are you talking about? This is the plan. This is it. There's no more appeals left, there's no more time. This is it. For me. Not for you. Are you fucking kidding me? You're backing out at the last second? This is your obsession, Ben. Not mine. You can never call me that. You're right. He's gone. You will not die. We are getting out of here. You wanna live on the run, huh? If we don't get shot. Is that kind of life you want? It doesn't matter. We will be together, free. It's not freedom. It's just another prison. At least we will be together. Listen to me. I'm here now. But when I die, I'll be everywhere. Always with you. Do you see? This body, this life, this Jane is ending. But this spirit, it's immortal. Ten years in here, with you. Ten years. And for what? To watch you die and do nothing? No way. Nothing? Nothing? You, you have done everything. To be with you. I can't just let go. You agreed to this plan. You are with me. You agreed. You agreed, we have to fight! No, Max. I just listened. See the truth. Nobody gets out of here alive, we all die. But, life, life is a gift. And it must be lived. Save me the esoteric, chi-gong bullshit, Master Jane. I gave it all up for you. And now you're telling me to let go? No, I will do what I have to, what we planned. Your plans, your choice. Your bullshit. You are being fucking cold right now but you will feel different after. I know you're scared, so am I. But you've got to trust me. Love me enough to hear me. Love you enough? I've proven that! Beyond a shadow of a doubt. Because that's what matters, right? Proof? Don't you see? Nothing is ever going to change the past. No amount of your self-imposed sacrifice. You don't get to tell me how it goes or what life is. You don't... have the market cornered. No! Fuck you! You, you will not die while I live. That was not the plan. You already ate it all. The pain, the grief, all of it. And for so long. I know that you've grown. I know that, that you've changed. You gotta let me go. I can't. Please. I can't. Jane. Be ready. My watch, Max. Rich. You've got to pay for what you did, bitch. Prevent you from spending six weeks in solitary? That's bullshit, and you fucking know it. This is about respect. The only respect you need is self-respect. Crazy fucking lady. What the fuck, man? One day, you'll die here in this prison. It ain't over 'til it's over. - You don't fucking know me! - Do you want me to? I will never fucking stop. I was the only white girl in my hood and I got beat up every fucking day until I learned how to fight back hard. And I never got beat again. You fucking owe me, bitch. You fucking owe me! Indeed. So, shall we wallow in our grief, pain and misery? Beat each other to death? Or, shall we have a cup of tea? You are not fucking listening, bitch! Ugh! Jasmine green tea. You're a trip, man. And you are curious about my art. Maybe. If you wish to learn, I wish to teach. I wanna know how you disappeared out of this cell. To be effective at chi gong, you must first develop tremendous energy through diligent practice. But that is only the beginning. You must purify your heart as well. You must have absolute clarity as to the purpose and the use of the power. What'd you just say? Cheech and Chong? Chi is energy. Life-force energy to be exact. Gong is skill or ability. Chi-gong, life-force skill or ability. Please. I don't know if you just spiked my tea, if this is even real or... you proved a point. Have I? Like you said, probably going to die here in prison anyways. It doesn't even matter if it's real. How long does it take? It's not about how long it will take. It's about how deep can go. If you have these energy skills, why don't you just leave? I made my choice. I take responsibility for it. I will die, as I have been condemned to. Spill. I lost self-control. I murdered two men with total brutality. Men. They probably had it coming. Perhaps. However, I must take responsibility for that is the way. The way? I take responsibility for my choices because I am free to choose. Yeah? Well then, why don't you choose to leave? Life and death, caterpillar to butterfly. Right? Before I kick the bucket, I wish to close my circle. Which is what? Unfinished business, leaving the world a little better than I found it. How do you know what that is? Deep down, we all know. We just have to take the time to contemplate, to see. Then, the courage to act. Well, let's do it. I'm in. Total commitment is required. Daily practice and complete trust. I have been training to fight my whole life. Discipline is not a problem. Integrity? Modesty, peace. You must purify your heart. I will never be pure. I am way past that. Intention is the key. Fine. When do we start? Good evening, Father Ross. Hello, Richard. Hello, Father. Hello, my child. How are you? I'm scared, as hell. Death can be scary. Have you confessed your sins, asked for forgiveness? You have a very pure heart, Father. I can see that. You can see things others probably cannot. Is that true? Maybe so. I'm gonna need all the help I can get. I'm here to provide any help you need. What can I do, my child? With our gifts, together, you will be able to see and help in a way that you were not aware of before. How so? Is there a prayer that you call The Light? Father in heaven, you made me your child and called me to walk in the light. Free me from darkness and keep me in the light of your truth. Can you say it at the crucial moment? I will but first, you must seek absolution, my child. When the time comes, you must act. Only God can decide what's to be done. The next time you see me, I will be another. But only you will know. Your words are strange, I don't understand. When the time comes, you must act. I will, if it's the Lord's will. The Lord's will is giving you a will. At the exact moment, you must help me. Promise me. I will try. I believe in you, Father. I know you'll do what's right. Let us pray now. Jake? Jake! Oh, my God. Wait, Father. Oh, my God. Jake... I promise I will help you. You love that dog. Remember when you got it? Hmm? I'm thirsty. Thanks. You know I love you. You're going to be okay. You know you're going to be okay. Mom? Yeah, honey? Dad? I don't feel so good. Jake? Jake, honey? Jake? Wake up, baby. - Come on, baby. - Code blue, we need a doctor and a crash cart stat! Ma'am? Ma'am, please step back. I need to work on him. Ma'am! Ma'am step back. Come on. Come on, baby. Jake, Jake! What's going on with this patient? V tach with pulses. Born with an abnormal heart condition. Respiratory distress. We had him waiting here. It didn't look... Give me the pads, give me the pads. Charge to 100. Charging to 100. Charging. - Clear. - Clear. - Shock. - Shocking. Jake. - Charge to 200. - Charging. - Clear. - Jake! Clear. - Shock. - Shocking. No. No, Jake! - Charge to 300. - Charging. - Clear. - Clear. Shock. No! - Flatline. - Jake! Give me the epi. Come on, Jake. Come on, Jake. No! We need another epi. No, my baby... No. What up, Killshot? I knew you'd be back. Is it on? Sure you want to do this? It's been a minute since you threw down, baby. Is it on? Why are you at this hospital? Is it on? Yeah, yeah. Vera agreed at five. Here's your fight shit right here. - Drive. - Yo, wait is that your... - Drive. Go. Go, go! - Jane! Hi. Hey. I, I just wanted to... thank you. You know, the last ten years... you make it bearable, possible. From what it was to what it's now become, I just want to thank you. Yeah. Would you die for me? You know the answer. Then live for me, Live for me and go on. This life is so precious. Don't squander it. I wish, I wish it were me instead of you. And then I would have some peace. But this, no way. I'm coming for you. It's a choice. Orphaned since infancy, and then the family, and then you. A life filled with grief. Alone in the world. But not this time. No more losing. That's the choice. You're going to have to kill people, Max. Your friends, innocent people. Who's innocent, Jane? No one. Jake. Not even him. His dying killed you. No, I did that all by myself. Sorry. Can I tell you a story? Sure. There lived a bum, whose name was Sid. He lived in a port city. Problem is, this damn bum, he didn't know how to swim. One night he, uh, he gets blackout drunk, ends up passing out on this boat. He wakes up in the morning to find that the ship goes out to sea with a whole crew. Sid is terrified of water. Sid starts running up and down the deck, freaking out 'cause he doesn't know how to swim. Yelling, "We're gonna die, we're gonna die, Captain!" He yells to his first mate, tells him to throw him overboard he can't handle the yelling anymore. "Throw this guy overboard!" So the sailors throw him overboard. And so Sid goes overboard. He's struggling to stay above water and he's drowning. Right, right as he's about to be submerged, the captain tells his men to pull him back overboard. So they do. They pick him up, haul him out of the water. Sid lands on the deck. And he sits there for a minute. Just breathing. Feeling the solid deck. Tears in his eyes, grateful to be alive. I love you. Let me go! Go! Jane! Jane. What did you do? What did you do? Fuck! I'll come. I'll come and visit you, baby. What's the fucking time, huh? No conjugals, no fucking conjugal 'cause we're not married, see? We're not married, so no conjugals. But officer, officer. She's my baby's momma. She, baby's momma. She's Jake's momma. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! That's fucking bullshit, bullshit! Fuck you. Ugh. Fucking death penalty. Death fucking penalty. I'm coming! Bull fucking shit. Bullshit! Fucking shit, man. It's fucking bullshit! Fuck you. Fucking death penalty. Fuck you. Fuck you! Hey, man... I'm sorry, man. This is sorry, this. Dead. We're fucking dead, man. We're fucking dead. We're so fucking dead. I'm fucking... Possible 10-84 in the alley between Highland and Washington. Do you have an I.D. on the subject? Male, 30s, um, hold on it looks like he's got a wallet down here. I.D. says Ben Jordan. E.M.T.s en route. Are you ready? Alright, we're gonna pick which one we're gonna build. Is this where's we're gonna live? No, this is where we're gonna pick a house that we like and then we're gonna learn how to build it, son. And then, we're gonna get a nice piece of land, we're gonna move out of the city, and we're gonna move into nature. Do you wanna live up in the canyons, do you wanna live, in the, by the water? Ocean! I like that. I definitely like that. What about you? Where do you wanna go? I am wherever you guys wanna be. So if you want me in the forest, I'll be in the forest. If you want me by water, I will be by water. - Can Ali come too? - Yes. Ali can live with us any time he wants. Which one, what are you thinking from here? This one. Wait... This one or this one, or this one? This, this big one. Yeah. I like the sounds of that, what about you? What do you say, Jake? You wanna go look at the houses and pick 'em? Let's see what we got here at CalEarth! Come on. Watch you feet, watch your feet. There we go. And... boom! Alright. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now look here, you see a real man opens the door for his ladies. You see? And that's our lady, there. So guess what you're gonna do? - Open the door? - Open the door! Wow, what a gentleman! What!? - There we go. - That is amazing. That's my man. Amazing, what'd you spill on your shirt? Get your dukes up! Come on, you two. Alright, let's pick out a home. We'll be so safe in these houses. Solid. Isn't that cool? This one is the one for sure! You think so? Whoa! This is amazing! Say it! R.K.O. - Yeah, this is not bad. - Do you know what this is? - No. - This is a wind catcher. No, seems like you've been doing your research. Natural technology. And this is all earth. Really? It feel unbreakable. If we get this house, can I please have bacon, eggs and pancakes every morning? Every morning. You can cook it. Oh, here you go. Pancakes, bacon. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Whatever you want. I will cook it. This is so the one. You can take that as a yes. Yeah? Take this as a yes, huh? So what do you think? I don't know... I think it's the one. I know for sure now. This is the one. This is the one. Well, you know how to pick 'em, champ. Because this is it, this is the one. Last supper. Thank you, Mr. Hill. It's been a pleasure, Ms. Arcs. Indeed. I'm ready. No. No good, no good. This is our final lesson. It must be perfect. Thank you, Master. To bend this reality, you must be present in totality. Only then will you tune into the dao. Only then will you be able to effect the environment. Again. All is possible. Sense the total unity of all that exists. Do so without effort. Only total presence. Time, space, this reality are all malleable. Intention. Intention is energy. It is chi. It forms the formless. Observe. Are you ready? Thank you, Master. This is not the end. I am here now. But when I die, I will be everywhere. You are welcome. Now, are you ready? My circle is complete. Put your hands through. Howdy. Bob. Uh. Oh, shit. You guys really got me. Wow. I was not expecting this. Alright, Bob. Open the door, come one old tyrant. Now, just take it easy, son. Look, now. I know we had our differences, but this is um, starting to be real fucked up, man. What? What the hell is going on here? Are you ready? For what? Are you kidding me? Back, step to the centre, turn around, put your back to me. Enough already. I don't know how you did this, but I am done. Now. So open the door. Open the fucking door! Max Stone. You've been condemned to death by a jury of your peers. No. No! I'm not in fucking prison. - That's not me! - The time now... 6:00 A.M. You motherfucker, I've read bible scripture for you, you drunk asshole! Jane, we have a child together. Our son Jake is tattooed on your heart. You motherfuckers! You fucking witch, I know you did this, you fucking witch. Let me out of here. - Let me out of here! - Do you have a sedative? He's lost his fucking mind. He's losing his fucking mind! Is this what you want? - Do you want this? - Fuck you! No! Let me out of here! Do you want to get sedated? Is that what you want? You want us to storm this out? Oh, goddamn it. I can't. It's too much. It's insane. This is insane. I can't, I can't. This is my plan. Goddamn it. You know what? You know what? Okay. Fine. Let's play your bullshit. Turn around. Come on! Let's go.

This is a dream. It's just a, it's just a dream. Keep moving, keep moving! - There is no way out. - Says you. All we gotta do is make it to the parking lot and we're history. - I can't let you do that. - I'm calling for the guards. You do that, and she's dead. Max, I'm not going anywhere with you. - Fuck off, fuck you! - Dose him, Jay, dose him! You are either going to fucking listen to me, I'm going to get you right now and you're going to be a fucking walking zombie. - You want that shit? - I want death! - You want that shit? Huh? - I don't want to die. - Dose him! - Jesus, save us! I'm doing it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! I'm okay. It's just adrenaline. I'm okay now. I'm clear. - I saw we dose him. - Bob? Christ almighty. I don't know. But there are his last moments. Is he okay? You okay? Don't worry, I'm alright, Rich, Bob, Frank. It's just adrenaline. I won't flip out again. I, I don't want to be a walking zombie, please. Please! Alright, let him up. This is crazy, we can't do this! My call, my responsibility. - Bob! - It's done, son. How, I... - Father Ross. - Jane. Into your hands, oh Lord we humbly entrust our brother. In this life, you embraced him with your tender love. Deliver him now from every evil and bid him eternal rest. The old order has passed away. Welcome him into paradise where there will be no sorrow, no weeping, or pain, but fullness or peace and joy, with your son and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen. My son. Do you have any final words? I love you. He's ready. - What is going on? - The sedative wasn't enough. He's reacting to the poison, we need to up this dose. What? Not again. You told me it was the right amount. Look, this is not a perfect science, okay? This has gotta be done by the book. Father in Heaven. You made me your child and called me to walk in the light. Free me from darkness and keep me in the light of your truth. He is going to continue suffering, it is like he's on fire. Let me increase this dose. Called into that light, I ask for your guidance. Form my life in your truth. - Please. - Give it five more minutes. If there's no change, then up the damn dose. My heart in your love, give me the power of your grace, and I may walk in the light. Jane. Yes, my love? I'm letting go. I'm letting you go, my love. Beautiful. Let's go, c'mon. Hey, Max. Frank. Just wanted to say, man. It's been a real pleasure. You're a good man. Thanks, Frank. It takes one to know one. Not that good. - Ah, he's alright. - I guess so. Bob. May the Lord protect you, brother. Thanks, preacher. Best of luck to you, my friend. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate that. Alright boys, I'll see ya. So Max, what are you going to do with the rest of your life? Imma live it, Frank. I'm gonna live it.
