Why, it's Pinocchio. I asked for Cyrano and they gave me this. They saw right through you. Place looks great. Kudos to Rae. - Hey, Sam. - Hey. You already wasted? I brought you a little something. Thank you. What are you, an ostrich? "One thing without stain," unspotted from this world, in spite of mine own doom, "and that is my white plume." - Hey, Sam. - Hey, Harry. How's it going, man? Hey, sorry to hear about your dad. Oh, yeah. I'm good. Listen, man, how did it happen? I don't know. Lt was a weird accident. Hey, you remember the time that he went windsurfing across the lake in that gorilla suit? I'll never forget him. I gotta give this acceptance speech. You should definitely wear the nose. "In my father's name, I accept this $7 wall dressing." Terrible grog anyway. It's a shame to dilute the rum. Watch my technique. Excuse me, Sam. This is all I learned in prep school. I was always on probation, they made me mop the halls. You want one? - My little private stash. - No. Alright. So what brings you to this gathering? It's Halloween. This is true. What brings you? One thing you can say about Nick and Rae... They're always well-stocked. Yeah, you've got something going in every hand. So you know Rae? I know Nick. Oh, yeah? How do you know Nick? How do you know Nick? I'm old friends with these guys. This is a crucial moment! So what's your name? Anna. Yeah? I'm Sam. Great party. Thanks, every time. Say goodbye to Nick for me. Yeah... Okay. - Goodbye. - Bye. So, you know, I hadn't smoked for years, but I'm gonna quit in the spring. But you know the whole country's against it so I feel it's my duty. You're very compulsive, Sam. Oh, yeah, you can tell that already? The moment I set eyes on you. Actually I'm committing suicide on the installment plan. Shit. What is it? I had these photos. Photos? Ann... Anna, this isn't... this isn't my coat. Oh, shit, this is someone else's coat... We gotta go back, We gotta go back. Oh, come on, I'm sorry. Can we just... It won't take a second. Can we just go back? You going to go back? Yeah. I'll wait here. I just got to get this guy's coat back. All right. Come here. Just in case you get stuck up there. - Call me sometime. - No, no, no, no. I'll be right back. Please, will you please wait? I'll wait. You promise? I promise. Well, you can just come get me. I'm not about to walk to the subway. I'm wearing two-inch heels. Yeah, great... - Hey. - Hi, Sam. How's it going? Anyway, I was leaving. Happy Halloween. You been up to your father's place? Oh, yeah, yeah, I was up there tonight. Yeah, there's a lot of shit to go through. So what about you? Did you find a place? Yeah, I think I found a sublet on St. Mark's. - Oh, yeah? Cool, good... - Well... I'll know for sure in the next couple of days. Well, you know, if you need any... help with the move, I'm not working... So you're leaving? Yeah, I gotta go. It's so early. Well, hey, it's the new me. I gotta go. Gimme a call about that move. Yeah, right. Hi, Liza! How are you? Sam's leaving while he can still see straight. Did you notice? Hey, Mike, look at this, man, I got robbed on the subway. They cut the money out of my pants while I was sleeping. Listen, man, can I get two coffees and the post? I'll pay you tomorrow. Yeah, sure. Alright, cool. Mud? Segundo, ¿Que pasa? Mr. Sam, amigo. Hair o' the dog that bit me. - Yo, Segundo! - Hey! Señor carrot man! How's your wife and my kids? - You can have them. - Straight to the back? To the back? To the back. To the back. So you have a good time at the Halloween party? I had a great time at the Halloween party. Yo, Lenny, we've got nothing on the mics. Let me tell you. I meet this girl, right? She comes straight up to me, none of that messing around, makes it very clear what she's after, you know? Anyhow, she takes me to a fucking boat. A boat? Lenny, can we get some sound up here? She, like, resides on a boat that's docked in Tribeca somewhere. I never heard of such a thing. I'm telling you I'm like, fucking out of my mind... Lenny, could we get some sound up here? All right, you got some sound now? Thank you... Anyway, I'm out of my mind, and before I know it she's taking me up to the poop deck and having her way with me. On the fucking poop deck, man! In front of all these Halloween freaks that are trudging about and shit. Can I get some sound on the acoustic? Yeah, Lenny, take care of these guys, man, I gotta make a phone call. Nicky, hey, listen, man, I'm trying to get in touch with this girl I met at the party. She said you invited her. No, never seen her before. We were leaving, she disappeared. Anna. Yeah? She said she knew you. Alright. Well, listen, I'm at the restaurant, I gotta go. Alright, see ya. Slimma! Hey, buddy, how you doing? How's it going, man? Alright. You want this? No. No, you keep it. Goodbye, Mud. I'll miss you. I can't believe how I'm getting the hairy eyeball from those two. What the hell did you tell them about me? Don't be so paranoid. No, they're treating me like the schmucky boyfriend who walked out on you. You're the one who's moving out, Liza. Well, I mean, somebody had to do something. Yeah, well... Anyway, I mean, you got what you wanted. You know, your freedom. Oh, Susan, that's great. Would you just put that lamp down over here by that... Watch that cord, Susan, you're gonna trip. You need some help with that? Hang on, just move, move. That's it. Well, you want to come up? I got a couple beers in the fridge and we're gonna order out for pizza, and... - I'll pass. - Alright. Well, thanks for the help. Sure. So, did you have a good time at the party? - What? - Nick and Rae's party. Did you? Go home with someone? No. I got stood up, to tell the truth. Speak of the devil. How you doing, Nick? You're only an hour and a half late. Sorry, I lost the address. That was convenient. - Hi, Liza. - Hi, Nick. - So how'd it go? - It was fine. We're done. Let me have a sip of that. So, you sure you don't want to come up? I gotta go. - You want to go? - Sure. Okay. So long. Sam, come here for a minute. - Nick, do you mind? - No. I just... I want you to be careful, okay? I'm fine. I mean, I think I'm doing the right thing, Sam, but I'm not giving up on us, you know. I understand. I don't want you to go crazy now, just because there's no one around to call you on it, alright? I gotta go. Fucking nightmare. I have a feeling I'm gonna go through that next. What, with Rae? Do you want to grab a drink at Gold Bar? - Where are we? - 1st Avenue. Let's just go to the Holiday. Come on. Hey, Nick. And what does she look like? I can't even remember, man. Can't even remember. I mean, is she short, is she tall? Big hooters? What's she got? Shortish. Nice figure, you know, enough to reel me in. Well... Hate to one-up you, Sammy boy, but you should see the chick I been hanging with. What, the one with the boat? She's quite a little number. Been seeing her ever since the party. Oh, yeah? What does Alison think of that? Fuck Alison. You alright? Yeah. Actually, considering how much I'm getting laid, It's amazing how shitty I feel. You look like shit, man. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. You going to the festival tonight with Nick and those guys? Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking of going. Prince and Mulberry? You okay? 7:00? - I'm fine. - You should lay off the hooch. You look sick as a dog. Hey, now, anybody else out there want to get in... Hey... Jesus, you guys, what's going on? Hey, listen, Rae's grandmother died. Oh, shit. We got a call this morning. Rae, you all right? Yeah, she's been sick a long time. I knew it was coming. Well, listen, you guys not want to do this, 'cause...? - She'll be okay. - Yeah, I'm fine. God. So, did you find your mystery girl from the party the other night? No, it's been driving me crazy. I can't even remember what she looks like. She's become the perfect date in my mind. Where the fuck is Lenny? - Is he coming or what? - I don't know, man, I saw him this afternoon. He was looking pretty sickly. I wouldn't be surprised if he passes. Fucking Lenny. I've probably spent a month of my lifetime over the years waiting for him. Listen, I'm going to get a beer. Anybody else? - Anna! - Hi, Sam. It's really you. What are you doing here? You never called me. You never left your number. You never found it? I... I left it in your pocket. Really? Well, I wish you had waited. I wasn't that long. I've been trying to find you. I've been thinking about you. I've been thinking about you, Sam. Listen, I'm with Nick and Rae, they had that party that night. We were going to check out the festival. I thought I'd found you alone. It's so amazing to see you again. - You're blushing. - Yeah? Well, listen, I... I should get this beer back to Nick and maybe we can go off to the festival on our own. - I'd like that. - Yeah? You gonna wait this time? I came back the last time. - You weren't there. - I'll be here. Listen, I'm sorry, you guys, I've just been so possessed, I gotta check her out. So what should we do? Lenny's not coming, I can tell you that. I don't know, Nick, why don't we check out the fair on our own? Maybe we should just head back uptown. Go on, Sam, you are released. You want to ride the Ferris wheel? I thought you'd duped me. Two tickets for the ride of your life. I'm kind of afraid of heights. This fucker keeps going. So what's the truth, did you crash that party? I heard about it through someone or other. I haven't crashed a party in years. No parties to crash. Everybody I know's gone their separate ways. So, you've known Rae a long time? Yeah, we went to school together when we were kids. We were gonna get married when we were nine. Okay, girls, 10 seconds please. Don't move, don't move. Five seconds left, please don't move, don't breathe. And relax. Robes! Come on. Hurry up, hurry up. Okay, girls. Okay, and relax. Yeah, this is a project that I've been working on for a little while. That's a lot of work. - Hope he gets published. - His ticket to immortality. So, tell me, Anna, did I blow it back there on the wheel? I just, I got a thing about heights. God, you're so beautiful. Oh, shit! Hey, listen, I need you to stand in for Lenny. No, tonight. He's fucking disappeared. I don't know, he didn't show up last night either. No? Fuck. Alright. Okay, thanks, I'll see you Tuesday. You need a little change? Alright, I'll be right back with that. How you guys doing? This salad has no dressing. Well, it does. If you want a little more, I can get it for you. I'm paying for the dressing, I'd like to taste it. Can you bring me a little container or something? Yes, I'll be right back with that. What is with that guy? This really sucks, Lenny. I hope you're hearing this, wherever you are. Tough night, Segundo? Alright, I'll see you, man. Okay. Hasta mañana. Anna! - Hi, Sam. - You found me. Incredible. I was wondering what happened to you last night. I tried to wake you. You had passed out. Really? Well, you know, I've been working late hours. You like hamburgers? I like a good hamburger. I was feeling a little lightheaded today, I thought I might need some red meat. You're not a vegetarian, are you, 'cause I know what that's about. - Not at all. - No? I could be a vegetarian, but there's just too much stuff I couldn't give up, like lobsters and clams. I don't think I could commit. What do you do at the restaurant, the dishes? Excuse me. No, I'm the manager four nights a week. What about you? Do you work? I work. Yeah. What kind of work? I don't like to talk about it. It doesn't really have anything to do with who I am. Do you know what I mean? Sort of. Well, how much do you need to know about someone to be attracted to them? To be attracted? Nothing. To stay interested you need their phone number. Well, I suspect that the less you know about me, the longer you'll stay interested. Why, you have something to hide? No. It's just that men like to fall in love, they don't like to stay in love. All love ends in sadness, that's my experience. People expect too much from love. Aren't you going to invite me in? I wouldn't leave you out there. Thank you. You want a glass of water or something? I feel kind of out of sorts if I can't offer you a drink. No, I'm fine. - This is a nice place. - Yeah. - You live alone? - Yep. - Someone used to live here. - Liza, my ex. You look happy in this picture. - You think so? - Yeah. God. I'm beat. It's your father. Yeah, does he look like me? Yeah. He traveled a lot? This is true. Your lip... It's cut. Yeah. Or is that... herpes? No. What is it then? Didn't you bite my lip in Battery Park? I didn't think you'd remember. Some things a guy remembers. A little... love nick. Just a little bit at a time. Because I like you. Sicko. Wait, wait. You got protection? Protection from what? Seriously... Oh, fuck. That's protection. Fair enough, fair enough. But it's not just pregnancy anymore. I'm not contagious. You gotta ask, you gotta ask. I used to cut my arms at parties. - You're a cutter. - See this one? That's my favorite. It's got the little... It's kind of a map. A cross. And then there's this one. You can't see that as well. That's... that's an old one. It's a weird thing, to puncture your skin. Skin is all there is between you and the rest of world. The blood is so eager to get out. You know, it's blue in the veins. Until it touches oxygen and turns red. And what about this? You pull out your teeth at parties, too? No, I was mugged. They kicked me in the face. I lost my tooth. They got six bucks off me. I like it. Well, you know, Sam, you might want to consider that you're pretty seriously on the rebound. Yeah, well... she's got a real ease about her, kind of a timeless quality. And you know, she jerked me off on our first date. That might have something to do with it. We are late for that funeral. Oh, shit. Come on, Rae's waiting for us. Alright, let's go, let's go. Come on, Nick. You should come. I know Rae'd want you there. What else are you gonna do? I don't know, something with Anna, I'm hoping. Well, Anna's invited. It's gotta be weird for you too, I mean, the first year without your dad. Yeah. What did you guys use to do? After my mom died? I don't know, I'd make a turkey and creamed onions. He'd have some of his cronies over, but... last year he was getting kind of despondent. He just wanted to be away, so we ate in this place uptown, just the two of us. It was pretty dismal. Well, come out to the house. The spirit of grandma will be there. Sam! Sam! Anna! Hey, hold on. This is the key to the front door. - Hi. - Hi. What's that smell? What? You got to be kidding me. What is it? You can't smell it, you're standing in it, I think. It's the cat box. Come here. Wait, come here. - The cat box is right there. - Look. Hey, what do you got? It's a barbecue set. We have to use it. Can we get on the roof? Yeah. So, we'll have a barbecue. Where did you get this? - It's really high-tech. - 14th Street. You shop anywhere but you buy on 14th Street, right? Alright. Okay, cool. So we'll move this operation upstairs. Great. I'll stay here. It's not that bad, it's just... Alright. Have you ever been naked on a New York rooftop? Not in this life. What would that be like? You're sort of an exhibitionist, aren't you? Sam, it's me. Well, it's been a while and I was just wondering how you're doing. And if you want to have coffee or something I have my mornings off and... It's good to see ya. How you been? Okay What's been going on with you? You look strung out. Well, you know, free life. - Hi. - Hi. Could I have a coffee, please? So, what's been going on with you? I don't know. Hey, did you hear about Lenny? - No, what? - He's gone missing. What does that mean? He stopped coming to the restaurant, he never called, nothing. Well, I mean, isn't he always threatening to just up and go? Yeah, well, I think it's weird. So what else is new? How's Nick and Rae? They're fine. Look at this. I gotta give this speech tonight about my dad. What are you going to say? That he liked to travel and he was never around. The reservation is they're too old, we can't put them on the air. I've got this young kid, he's very telegenic... So, how's the apartment and stuff? It's okay, you know. St. Mark's place is kind of funny, I guess, it's sort of a circus. Well, I'd love to come by and see it. You should. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened to your lip? I get that every year. It's herpes or something, right? You seem nervous. Too much coffee. I been feeling a little weird. Yeah? Like what? Wait a minute, I'm visualizing. Liza... I've started seeing somebody. I'm not saying it's serious or anything, but I just... I just feel like we should start to say our thing is over. We don't have to have this conversation right now. I know, I know. It's just so you know. Well, that didn't take long, How long have you known her? Liza, come on. Are you fucking her? What do you think? I hope you're being careful. Liza, come on. You met her at the Halloween party, right? I knew it when I saw you there. Liza, this isn't a separation if you're going to keep quizzing me on evertyhing. I mean, how is this any different than living together? You got me under a fucking microscope. That's not me, Sam. That's you doing that to yourself! - Oh, shit. - What's the matter? Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just a little hungover. Listen, this was a bad idea. I'm gonna go. Will you just wait for a minute? Look at you. How much longer can we keep this up? - Is she moving out? - All packed. What's up with you two? Just stopped enjoying each other, I guess. That's enough out of me for this evening. And now what we all came here for: To hear from his son, Sam. Let's bring him up. Come on, Sam! Thank you. I'm not very comfortable in these situations... but I did try to put down a few thoughts about my father. I've been thinking about him and... I believe that he never stopped searching... traveling around, especially later in life. I think that he took great comfort in history, in the past. He seemed to identify with the ruins of great civilizations as monuments to some sort of idealism, which he felt was lacking in the "culture of narcissism," as he liked to call it. That was Christopher Lasch, but my father liked that phrase. He had a lot of ambivalence about popular culture and the media and I think he felt that the education system discouraged real self-discovery. I'm sure you've all discussed these issues with him. Anyway, I think that made him... bitter. But he was not a pessimist or a cynic, as some of his detractors would have it. I think... I think he was an optimist who'd... come up against a lot of disappointments... but here, in this institution, I think he felt idealism was still possible and I think that meant a lot to him. Lt meant everything to him. So in his honor, I... I... accept this memorial. I'm sorry. Thank you. And now maybe we should all get a drink or something. Thank you. - Sam. - Mr. Lyons. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm just a little run-down. Well, I'm sure all of this has been pretty hard on you. Yeah. That was very fine, what you said. Lt would have meant a lot to your dad. Thank you. Thanks. How is that girlfriend of yours, the painter? Oh, Liza. She's fine. Your father was fond of her. She was studying archeology at Barnard, right? - That's right. - Very good, yeah. She's trying to decide which way to go now, painting or archaeology. Your father was tickled pink about that. Oh, yeah, they got along very well. - Who's this? - Anna... Hi, sorry I missed your speech. - How'd it go? - It was fine. Mr. Lyons, this is Anna. Hi. Jerry Lyons. Nice to know you. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Here, Sam, I got you something in honor of the occasion. My! What is it? How extraordinary! Peter, come and take a look at this. Come here. Take a look at this. Look, don't touch. It's for Sam. What was that all about? You're not mad, are you, that I showed up? That was just so fucking weird. Come on. - What? - Listen. What are you hearing? I don't... They're out tonight. What are those, dogs? Central Park used to be filled with wolves. Oh, shit. Anna, come on! Call an ambulance! Go! Watch out, man! Don't move him, don't move him, don't move him! - Don't move him. - I just saw him come up... Wait, he's falling, he's falling! Push him back in. Anybody getting the ambulance, or what? Don't touch it, Anna! His little life is slipping away. Don't move him, don't move him, don't move him! Wait, he's falling, he's falling! Don't move him, push him back in! Anybody getting the ambulance, or what? Jesus, is he breathing? It's the child we'll never have, Sam. Seriously, Anna, let's get the fuck out of here. You're being perverse. Take me, Sam. Rub your hard cock against me. You've got a very morbid streak, Anna. What, and you don't? I don't know, maybe. With your scars, Sam? Drinking yourself into a stupor every night. I got the gloom gene in my family. Goddamn it! Look, I'm fine, alright? I just need to get home. It's been a fucking intense night. I've just, I've had it. Listen... I'll see you tomorrow, we have the whole weekend, all right? I'll see you tomorrow. Alright. Alright. - I'm sorry, I... - Be well. - Sam. - Yeah? Do you like me? After that? Really. Yeah. Why? I guess... I guess you seem... lonely. Put up a tough front. That appeals to me. Why? You lonely? I don't know. Maybe I am. We live as we dream, alone. Who said that? You did. No, no, it was someone... Mr. Sam? You okay? I don't know, man. You don't look so good. What is the deal? Mr. Sam. Todo esta bien. I'm fine, man, I'm fine. Here you go. She left a message on my machine. She's going to meet us out there tomorrow. I'm sorry. I should have checked sooner. Think nothing of it. Let's go then, before we get slammed by the traffic. Quit showing off, Nick. I'm trying to get us out there before Christmastime. I would not take the breakdown lane, Nick. There're cops all over the place. Now, isn't this nice? Sheep! You are all sheep! Hey! Mr. King Fuck. Hey! Hey, Mr. Teenage Entrepreneur! Hey, asshole, move over or I'm going to come over there and kick your balls in! Kick your balls in? She means it, too. Grandma's kitchen. I'm gonna go to bed. You know where it is? Yeah. Good night. Sam... Sam... These were made by grandma. Really? That's weird, right? Very sacred. Yeah. To be cherished. Wonder what she put in there. So, Sam... How's this thing with Anna turning out? It's... I don't know. There's something about her, you know? Yeah, I can't get a handle on it, but... it's, it's... I'm not really saying anything, I mean... Well, if you're happy. Oh, yeah. So, what about you, Rae, how are things going? Things are pretty hard right now. Yeah? I'm trying to make a major life decision and both options are pretty disappointing. Really, like what's going on? Sam, a swim in the ocean. You're kidding. We must be manly and go for a dip in the sea. That's impossible, man. - I'm sick. - Nonsense. Good for the circulation. Anyway, I need the company. Walk me to the beach. What about you, Rae? You want some help here? Entertain Nick, that's help enough. Alright. But I may not go in. - We'll finish this later. - Yeah. Jesus, man. To the sea! What am I supposed to do with this? You put it on. That's a start. Then we walk into the ocean, we put our bodies into it... So I told her it was over... Come on, we can't return to the house in defeat. Look, I'm keeping you company, Nick. I don't feel well. Go into the fucking water. I'll be your witness. What is with this new frailty image you're cultivating? Always the martyr. Always the victim. Don't be unkind, dude. Alright. I'm going in. Fucker! Sorry. Listen, Nick... No, listen, I'm thinking of leaving early tomorrow... Sam, he's looking weird... I don't think you should encourage him drinking. This woman Anna is obviously doing him no fucking good. You spend so much time worrying about him. It's not about Sam and me. Sam can take care of himself, believe me. Not everything's about money, Nick. Happy Thanksgiving, Nicky. Yep. The hunter's moon, now, that's the name given the full moon in October, see, that's when the hunter is most empowered. Sam, the gravy. No, no, no, every full moon has a name. The harvest moon, that's the full moon in September. And of course there's the blue moon, that's when there's two full moons in the same month. - And that happens, well... - Once every blue moon. Precisely, thank you. Rae, you're looking like quite the little temptress tonight in your antique gown. Lt really is beautiful. Where did you get it? It was in my grandmother's closet. I just put it on and it fit. You know, I've never really been attracted to antiques. I always like what's happening now. Well, it belonged to my grandmother. That's why I like it. You've got sort of an Emma Peel thing going there, Anna. That's very retro. Yeah, well, you pick up a few things along the way. Rae, a toast, a toast to the chef, Rae... Thank you so much. Thank you, Rae. Thanks for coming. And to the glorious hypocrisy of the Thanksgiving feast! And to the principles first embodied in the Constitution. The rest we'll just leave to that time-honored commodity: Historical amnesia. Anna, you haven't eaten anything. Aren't you hungry? Anna's never hungry. Oh, really, doesn't that put a damper on your courtship, Sam? Don't you always cook for your dates? Now, Rae, you're giving away all my techniques. Now he's cultivating the ill health routine. Oh, yes, it's very sexy. It's okay, Sam, you already won me over. Thank you. Did you all hear that? Lt was my manliness. Oh, yes. Sam and I went swimming today. It wasn't so bad. Is he all right? Excuse me. Is he all right? Oh, yeah, he just hasn't been feeling well lately. That's just the change in the weather. How's this thing with Anna turning out? How is that girlfriend of yours, the painter? Two tickets for the ride of your life. My God, there you are. We thought we'd lost you. Did you see that? Yeah, you frightened it. What happened to you at dinner, anyway? You disappeared. - Cramps. - Oh, really? I've got some pills for that if you need them. No, you know what? I'm feeling better. So... so what's going on with you and Nick? What? You seem distracted. It's a lot of things. Right. Your grandmother. What is your deal, Anna? Excuse me? What do you do? I don't believe Sam's ever told me. I've never told Sam. Really? You and Sam is... absurd. I'm sorry. Are you still carrying a torch for him? I mean, hasn't it been quite some time since he used to get drunk and knock you around? Man, I don't know when you started this thing about Rae, but I'll tell you... I wouldn't be too flip about it. I mean, she's pretty together. Yeah, I know. Where is our little cast of characters, anyway? Our little starlets? Rae went for a walk, isn't that what you said? Right. Right, right. It's a good thing, too. I'd hate to think of them upstairs together. They seem to dislike each other. Yeah, what is that, anyway? Have you ever noticed that Rae is jealous of every girl you go out with? That's in your head, man. Open your eyes, man. Jesus. Your dress is ruined. You didn't like it anyway. I like you in it. What is this, a come-on? The setting's so ripe. I've never gotten into that. Anyway, there's Nick. Is that all it is? No. I don't trust you either. No, that's... That's all I need. So, if it wasn't me... and I... wasn't with Sam... but I am with Sam, you know? And he's with me. We don't want to get into this. I hope Rae is alright in this rain. She should be back. Look at this piece of shit note. We're getting stiffed for the whole weekend, they've gone back to New York. They took the train. Nobody even woke me up. Well, I can't wait here the whole weekend being pissed off. Exactly. We close up the house and we get out of here. Shit. Nick. We gotta do all the fucking dishes, man. Sam. Jerry Lyons here. I wanted to thank you again for the other night and listen, I'd like to have a word with you about the young woman you brought to the reception. If you've got a minute to, give me a call. We can talk. - Liza. - It's Sam. Yeah, Sam? Happy holidays. What's going on? We didn't really get a chance to talk, you kind of split on me. Well, I mean, I don't really need to watch you stumble around with a hangover, Sam. You know I've done that routine already. I wasn't hungover, I'm sick. What's the matter with you? Listen, Liza, you want to get together, just to hang out? I don't think so, Sam. Well, I haven't even seen your place set up yet. You know, I mean, I thought that if I just left you alone for a while, you'd try to do something about your drinking, Sam, you know, I mean... decide what you wanted to do with yourself. I didn't think that you'd be dating in 10 minutes. I'm not dating someone, I just met someone. I'm not... I'm not mad at you, if that's what you're worried about. You're off the hook. Come on, let me come by. I'll bring a bottle of wine... Or whatever, I'll bring a bottle of seltzer. Oh, fuck. Make it a bottle of wine. Is that a yes? Oh, Jesus, you scared me. Sorry I'm late, Sam. You weren't making other plans, were you? What the fuck, Anna? Don't be mad. What happened to you two last night? We went for a walk. We got back, you were both passed out. Sam... could you not? Please don't, just be with me tonight, okay? We didn't have our weekend together. I gotta apologize. Liza, you there? You wanna pick up? I'm sorry. I'll call you later. No one home? I don't get you. So this is what you do? You pine away over Liza when I'm not around? I was giving her a call, if you don't mind. Sam, I don't want to have to compete for your interest. It doesn't feel good. Anna, I need some time to work some stuff out. I'm feeling really out of sorts and I just, I don't think we should... I just need some time. I can give you time. Anna, wait. You say something? I'm not saying anything, I... Sam, don't worry about it. Don't lose any sleep over it. I'll get mine. Anna. I really... I really... I had a thing for you, I just, I need some time, all right? Right. Here's your key. Sorry, had it made. I... force of habit. You can't see he's in total denial about his father? Sammy boy... On the fucking poop deck, man... Already wasted? So, you've known Rae a long time? "The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity." That should appeal to you a little bit, Sam? Sam? Hunter. Just a little bit at a time because I like you. Sam! Sam... Sam! Hey. Nick! Hey, Sam, I was downtown. Thought I'd swing by, offer you a beer. Thanks, man. I'll pass. Yeah? What's the matter? You sick? You were pretty crazy out there on the road. I don't know, man. I just feel like I'm falling apart, like my fucking health is failing me. Well, what's going on? I mean, how do you feel? I know what it is, man, it's just so fucking weird, I've been afraid to tell you. Yeah, what is it? You're a mess. It's about Anna. Oh, God. What? - Nothing. - Go on. What about Anna? So, you know, I broke it up with her last night. That was quick. What's that been? Two, three weeks? Man, things went fast with that fucking chick, she really... she really messed with me, you know, like an animal, like a fucking parasite. Yeah, I know what you mean. No, you don't have any idea what I mean, Nick. Well, look, Sam, you broke it up with Liza so you could be with Anna, the "mystery girl," and now things are so fucked up, it's made you realize what a turd you are and it's made you ill, a sick person. That's not what's going on. Well, what is it? You're being so mysterious. What has transpired between you and Anna that's making you so crazy? Let me tell you this, man. I'm all ears, Sam. So listen, man, that first night, right, after the festival? We're like, getting it on in Battery Park, you know, and she bites into my lip. I was been wondering what that was, - I was afraid to ask. - No, I'm serious, man. She's biting into my lip to draw blood. So I say, "What the fuck, Anna, what are you doing?" and she says, "Just a little bit at a time, Sam," and she sticks her finger in the cut and like, licks the blood off. So? You don't understand, man, She does it like every time. Like, we'll be screwing or something, and she like, bites me and starts sucking the blood. And what are you doing, man, are you getting off? I don't know, man, it's like totally amazing, it's like nothing I've ever felt before. It's like when we're screwing, it's like having warm milk running through your veins or something. What are you saying? Because she's biting you? Yeah, and then I'll wake up, and I'll have like, a puncture mark on my arm or on my chest or something. I don't get it, I mean, she's biting you in these different places, and then she's sucking your blood? Actively sucking it? Yeah, and then, you know, then I started feeling sick like this and I started to wonder, because of what happened to Lenny. Wait a minute, what does Lenny have to do with this? I'm telling you, man, before he disappeared, he was sick the same way. Hold on now, Sam. No, I'm serious, man. I mean, at first I was going with it 'cause it was like, you know, it was kinda cool. I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's just like our little thing, like me and Anna, right? And then I started feeling sick like this, you know, and out of it? And I started to realize this fucking chick is like, drinking my blood, like in a way that's affecting my health. Sam, you should have stayed in the arts. You have such a fertile imagination, such a propensity for Gothic melodrama. I mean, seeing you work in a restaurant is like, well, to use your beloved guy, it's like Cyrano without his plume. Fuck you, Nick. No, fuck you. What is this concoction you've come up with? That Anna is drinking your blood and that she's drinking Lenny's blood? You never gave a fuck about Lenny disappearing. Lenny is always disappearing; He's an irresponsible fuck! No, man, it was Anna, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Anna what? What are you really trying to say, Sam? That Anna is sucking your blood? And she's sucking Lenny's blood? Are you trying to tell me that Anna's a vampire? Get a fucking grip, man. Listen, man, I know it's absurd, but I swear to God, man, I've never seen her eat, I've never seen her drink, I've never seen her smoke. I've never seen her once, not once, in the daylight. I've never seen her take a shit or a piss, for Christ's sake. And for that she's a fucking vampire? 'Cause she won't shit in front of you? I'm not telling you she's a vampire, man, I'm not asking you to believe she's a vampire, I mean "vampire". Maybe she thinks she's a vampire. Maybe she thinks that you think that she's a vampire and that's getting you two off. Listen, man, I'm just telling you what I know that this chick does, right? She drinks blood. Vampires do not exist, Sam, and it is unfortunate. They would provide much diversion from the miseries of life, many of which you have effectively avoided since your mother passed away and left you that little nest egg. You reveal yourself, Nick. Never mind that, then. I would prefer to make this point: Vampirism is everywhere. Lt is hiding in our hearts, Sam. It is at the bottom of a bottle, or a needle in the arm, it is 500 channels of insipid cultural dribble. The advertising and gluttony, draining us of our ability to think. It is the insidious Faustian bargains we make every day. The little compromises that eat at our soul, but believe me, it is not to be found embodied in Anna. She's not that deep. Hey, maybe she does... drink blood. I don't know, she probably belongs to one of those bloodsucking cults or whatever they are, but believe me, she is not a vampire. And you, Sam, had better pull yourself out of this rut you're going through, God forbid, maybe lay off the booze for a while, or whatever it takes to pull yourself together. And if she's been biting you, I'd get a fucking AIDS test. Sounds like very unsafe sex you've been having. You disappoint me, Nick, man. I can't even talk to you, you're so fucking... It's like you got the shade down. Sam, what do you want me to say? I mean, really? I just wanted to tell you this shit that's been going on. Sure. Have your say, you know, that's it, alright. - Yeah, Sam... - that it's over. It's over, Sam. You're gonna be fine. I'm scared, man. I feel like I'm cracking up. Listen, come have a drink with us. Rae and me. I told you, man. I'm not drinking. You should be drinking. It's probably the best thing for a man in your shoes. Why don't you just get out of here? Sure. - You take care of yourself. - Yeah. Maybe you are, you know, really sick. And... maybe you should talk to someone. I will, Nick. You can come visit me at the Creedmoor. Look, Sam, your father died two months ago. He'd been away, he stopped calling, it looks like he died on a binge or something. You're feeling unresolved, you've got a right to. Look, all I'm just trying to say is that I don't think Anna is your problem, okay? I hear ya, dude. Alright. Look, take care, okay? Call me and tell me what Freud has to say. Mud? Yo, Mud. God. Liza, Liza, it's Sam. Listen, I'm in trouble. You gotta let me come over. Okay, please? Okay. I think I'm cracking up. Liza. I remember you. Have you seen Liza? The woman who lives here? I don't want no trouble here. Liza? Liza, Liza. Liza! There's trouble in the neighbor's apartment. That's right, picking the lock. That's right. I heard loud noises. That's right. He's still in there. That's right. You can catch him if you hurry. How is that girlfriend of yours, the painter? Are you trying to tell me that Anna's a vampire? Get a fucking grip, man. How is that girlfriend of yours, the painter? Wait! This is a crucial moment! Leave a message for Nick or Rae after the beep. Nick, it's Sam. Listen, man... Give me a call at my father's house, all right? I'm serious, man, I'm in deep shit! Sam. Nick? Hello? This is Anna. Hi, Liza. Sam's told me about you. So, you want to talk to him? Sam... Liza's on the phone for you. It's not possible! Sam, she really wants to talk to you. Are you gonna come out? Sam? He's in the bathroom and he won't come out. Can he call you back? How'd you find us? Well... Liza, listen, I'm really worried about him, he's locked himself in the bathroom and he's not coming out. I don't know, but he's... he's saying he's sick. So maybe you can come by and... No! No more! No! No. Wait out here. Aren't you just a little bit curious, Sam, how it tastes? How it feels? Drink, Sam. No. Sam. Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! No! Somebody call an ambulance! Hey, call an ambulance! Don't touch him! He's bleeding! Call an ambulance. Call 911. Hey, somebody call an ambulance. He was hanging out there. He was hanging for so long.
