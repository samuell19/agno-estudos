Welcome to our humble translation Enjoy watching the documentary In 2002, Mars was a mass grave for spacecraft. Two out of three missions at the time were failures. It was Spirit and Opportunity's turn. And they were in trouble. The drop was successful. But it wasn't so good that the parachute exploded. It's a miracle they ever made it to Mars. But they did. And then no one can stop them. You shouldn't put money into failing rovers. I'm not. That was 15 years ago. Like a car that runs a million on the odometer without changing the oil. never heard of it before. Now their mission is over. They have permanently conquered the borderlands of Mars. Their persistence and their discoveries mean we have to go back. Spirit and Opportunity, the legendary conquerors of Mars. Contrary to all expectations, it has been going on for several years. Climb the mountains and the walls of the crater - - Survived dust storms, icy nights and broken wheels. Brave explorers destined for greatness. At least that's the way it works now. "Of course it will be a great success." It certainly wasn't like that in the beginning! I didn't even know if we were going to get to Cape Canaveral. to the launch pad. Sometimes it seemed like it wasn't going to happen. In the beginning, long before they were heroes - - Was the rover a last-ditch effort? - to prove that NASA can still manage Mars. I wouldn't say we were desperate - - But we had our backs to the wall. In 1999, NASA suffered two embarrassing defeats on Mars. Orbiter too wild for confusion over measurement systems... ...and the lander might shut down the engine too early. We never find out what happened to her. So by the end of 1999, the Mars program was for Rats. With the question of whether Mars is worth the risk - NASA dropped most of the plans and discussed next steps. We can just pack up and say, "Forget it." So we started talking about what actually worked. It was a Pathfinder mission. Pathfinder was a low budget experience - — from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory prior to the two failed missions. We wanted to prove that you can build something simple - It facilitates landing on Mars. That was exciting. small team. We've done completely new things. One will find a new way to land on Mars - - Use of airbags with landing craft inside - - With a touring cart the size of a microwave oven. It's been 20 years since someone landed on Mars. The people who made Pathfinder built it from the ground up. And they were young. Fourth of July 1997 succeeded. And the little rover was a huge success. So the follow-up project should restore people's confidence in expeditions to Mars. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California - - We had to build the spacecraft, and land it on Mars - - And manage the task as it arrives. A planetary scientist named Steve Squires was to lead the researchers - A new way to explore Mars. We've had some failures behind us and a lot of uncertainty ahead - - So there was a lot of interest in our mission. I don't know what would have happened if I had failed. It wasn't good Squyres provided this animation to show how it should work. From the smoldering approach in the atmosphere down to ground level. The idea was to mimic the original Pathfinder lander. With the same airbags and canopy but something different inside. On Mars Pathfinder, the lander's computer and brain were in it. This is where most of the devices have been. What made this mission different were the rovers. We put the largest possible rover into the lander. And everything can move. Everything goes with you on the go. All devices and computers - - which means you can really explore. This rover was going to do more than just land on Mars. It was for exploration like a geologist - - and look for signs of the possibility of life on Mars. NASA decided to build not one, but two of these robotic geologists - To increase chances of success. When the plan was approved, the schedule was already tight. Earth and Mars are close enough to each other - - To submit a task once every 26 months. If you miss, you have to wait another 26 months. The deadline was the summer of 2003, in less than three years. We have assembled a team. It was my first time doing it, so I had a lot to learn - - And not much time to learn it. He just had to work. no longer. We've done this by pushing an incredibly talented team - Much harder than it should have been. People worked insanely hard. We were so committed that we gave it our all. Difficult job went to team - - Who was responsible for something seemed obvious: Getting the Pathfinder Landing System to work with the new Rovers. Usually, when we develop a mission, we have about five years. We only had about three years for spirit and opportunity. Tight schedule. We thought it would probably work because we re-used the landing system. I was young and hungry, and had a relatively new Ph.D. I became a mechanical engineer on the landing system. - So I had to learn more about parachutes, airbags, missiles and heat shields - - And a lot of new things that I didn't learn in school. Approaching, descending and landing. EDL abbreviation. Covers everything from atmospheric approach to landing. The problems started with the Pathfinder's airbags. We will use the same technique. Exact same airbags. We just wanted to rebuild those airbags. For the first test, they found a pair of spare airbags in the Pathfinder. We will start testing right away. We used the world's largest vacuum chamber. - 30 meters high and 23 meters wide - - Which we can transfer to Mars - - and dropping airbags on a simulated surface on Mars. The worst possible landing site on Mars. We were sure it would work. Jet Propulsion Laboratory? - Finished. We amplified them. - And when you hit the surface, you can see a huge gap. That was not good. At first we just thought: "Here are some old pillows." So we had to make some new pillows and go back. So we did. In the next test, we looked through the same cameras... "Explosion!" Big hole where the pillows roll out. Now we can feel the pressure. Next it was about parachutes. We tested them at the National Guard shooting range south of Boise, Idaho. We raise the test vehicle with the parachute on. We raise it high, and release the test bowl - - and watch the canopy unfold beautifully, and then ... Once again we think, "Damn it too!" The drop was successful. But it wasn't so good that the parachute exploded. - It better happen here... - From Mars. Unfortunately, the parachute that just exploded was - - The same one who was going to Mars. I think it was the same day we had another test ship - - which we raised, and threw ... ...and bang. Then it also exploded. So we all went back to the hotel - - To solve the mystery of why parachutes exploded. The airbags and parachutes are broken and there is nothing I can do. It's in the hands of the engineers. It is up to them to solve the problem. You just have to cross your fingers. We're struggling to find the time and resources - - to redesign things we thought we could reuse. It didn't take long to find the problem. The Rovers Were Bigger and Heavier Than Expected - - and grew out of the old landing system. When we figured out what size the rover needed to be to do the job - - Everything had to be redone. New landing gear, airbags and screens. He ruined our schedule and blew the budget. Meanwhile, the researchers had to decide - Where on Mars should the rovers investigate? - If there was water that could sustain life. One possible location was a flat plain called Meridiani Planum - Where a mineral was discovered that could have formed in the water. Meridiani wasn't an obvious choice. The best part about it was that it was seamless. And there wasn't much wind. It seemed like a safe place to land and walk around. The most exciting target was Gusev Crater - - which looked like a dry lake bottom. Gusev is a 160-kilometer-wide crater with a dry riverbed. There was no water several billion years ago - - But it's a big hole with a river - - So there must have been a lake. Joseph's downside was the wind. A crosswind may cause the system to oscillate - - And if we ignite the missiles - - Then we can smoke sideways and damage the airbags. In the Gusev crater, they will have to face the wind with cruise missiles - - This requires a lot of airbags and parachutes. Number of days to send: 505 After more than a year of work - - The landing party returned to the unloading room. The airbags have been redesigned for worst-case scenarios on Mars. - She looks good. - like. It's great. About seven minutes. - she's perfect. There are no cracks. Extra layer of Vectran, an advanced synthetic fabric. - Absorbs shocks from rocks. It is a nice. Type of bulletproof vests - - which protects the double inner cushions with air. Airbags were ready for Mars. It's beautiful. By then, the team thought they had solved the parachute problem, too. But they failed to prove it. After the parachute failure in Boise - - We needed a way to be able to test faster - - and in a more controlled setting. So we called the largest wind tunnel in the world. It is a test section eight stories high and 37 meters wide. We have a big pole in the middle - - which holds the parachute cylinder - Like the ones we'll use on Mars. They spent several months building new parachutes. - And there was no time for further setbacks. This is the big test. If things go wrong here - - Then we become more desperate than we want to be. Propellers can blast up to 160 kilometers per hour, so the parachute - It unfolds with the same force and high speed as in the thin atmosphere of Mars. Three, two, one, fire. it is turned on. Come now, come now. Come now, come now. - It's... - Violent swings. Now what is that? It is called "squid" in the skydiving world. It was the first time I saw her. It was the first time for many. We were blown away. what should we do? It's really sad. Just when we thought we were at the finish line, it suddenly happened. It was the worst feeling I've ever had. because it will not swell - - It could be because of a lot of things - - And we didn't know what. I actually thought it was the death of the project. Because if we don't find a solution, we won't be able to get to Mars. When the parachute failed to deploy, it looked like the mission was over. Problems with supersonic parachutes can be a nightmare to solve. Fortunately, there was a simple solution to this puzzle. The ventilation hole at the top of the canopy was too large. Once that was resolved, they were back on track again. We found out very quickly - The umbrella here is strong. - It unfolds well. This is the parachute we'll take to Mars. Well stirred. In January 2003, the parachutes were ready - Just five months before launch. The relegation team's biggest problem was now behind them. But each solution was a reminder of how short the period from success to failure can be. Every time we encounter a problem, we find a solution. But you never know when you will run into an unsolvable problem. An error can occur at any time - - So you just have to say: "That's it. It's over." It was very scary. Rovers, research equipment and spacecraft - - Tested over and over again. Relentless pursuit of everything that could go wrong. People knew that a failed mission was worse than no mission at all. Do you care about your ex? - So the people at NASA headquarters thought, which I understand now - - But it didn't happen after that - It's better not to turn them away. - One big unnecessary risk. Four months before launch, everything moved to the Kennedy Space Center. Everything changed when we got to Florida. There is a mood that it fuss or fall. We have assembled and disassembled the rover many times. In Florida, everything came together for the last time. Everything that is installed and modified is for the last time. If something goes wrong in the smallest ordinary thing there - - So you are facing an unsolvable problem on Mars. The soul had to be sent first. But with only a few weeks left, they run into a problem. We knew there was going to be one last big problem. You don't know what, but our last one was really big. It was about the electrical circuit of the Pyros - - Locking mechanisms that release the attachment parts during and after landing. Circuits tested with real viruses. But it was discovered that they might not work on Mars. The electronics design meant there was danger - Some of our tests damaged parts inside the rover. The problem was that our schedule was now very tight - - that we couldn't even check out the parts inside the rover. The rover is ready to go. We cannot now separate them. This would spoil the schedule. It can threaten the entire mission. The rovers might end up in a space museum. If we can't launch it now, why? The only way to check for damage - - Was searching for all used debris and searching for short circuits. It was a pure treasure hunt. People looked in their bags and on the shelves and sorted things out. The last thing they found - - which can prove whether everything is fine it was found yesterday. With three days to go, there is still resistance. It was awful. The deadline has been reached. to hit their targets - - Each rover was to be launched within three weeks, one at a time. If it doesn't work within the three weeks - - Then we had to wait another 26 months. It was scheduled to be released at that time. They were given two chances each day at 40 minutes. And everything from the weather to missiles might make them wait. After five days of bad weather, Spirit was ready to go. June 10, 2003 A very large percentage of launches are successful. But the success rate is not 100 percent. You can hit a bad day - — and then everything you've worked so hard for turns to smoke. Everyone tenses and sweats. And a little nervous. The NSC reports that the spacecraft is ready. 20 seconds. There is a moment when you realize this is happening right now. Put the pencils down, that's it. Now he is going to Mars. Nine, eight, seven, six... It's all green. ... five four three two one! Motor start. Now a Delta 2 rocket with Spirit on board is heading for Mars. We have launched. - Off you go! - Come darling! - beautiful. - Come here! Come here. He flies. How cool. We are approaching Mach 1. We have exceeded the speed of sound. Everything seems fine. amazing! Ka Teng! The system works perfectly. Sends a perfect picture. We are now at an altitude of 7.5 kilometers. Now is the chance. A series of missile problems shortened the launch period. - so that was soon now or never. that's it. It was night, and we were on the beach and ready. - Twenty seconds. - Thieves! Countdown. You get "ten, nine, eight, seven..." You're ready, and with seven seconds left they say stop. - The clock has been reset. - The countdown has stopped. Stop the countdown with seven seconds left. - Because of a missile problem. And then you shouldn't take it easy. Seven seconds. It's a bomb ready to go off. - And as soon as I interrupted them, I thought: "Now it's over." But they managed to fix the error and after 40 minutes we took off. The engine situation looks good. It handles launch well. It was overwhelmingly emotional like never before. Rocket engines increase their power. We have introduced a lot of ourselves for many years. Then you fire the missile and everything disappears. The pressure is stable and the engines burn well. It couldn't be further. And as strange as it may sound, it was hard to say goodbye. We are now passing Mach 1 and supersonic speed. After a seven-month journey - - Should the spirit hit the Martian atmosphere - - 19,000 kilometers per hour. Six minutes later it was due to land. All systems are ready for approach and landing. With a radio delay of about ten minutes - - People on Earth could not help. Each step is pre-programmed into the Spirit computer. You can't do anything during the Mars landing. You have no control in the control room. The team will soon see - Whether a system that worked on Earth also works on Mars. One cannot fully experience the descent system here. It was all analysis, pen and paper and computer simulation. Individual parts testing. You collect everything only once - Exactly in the sky above Mars. There were many things that could go wrong during the landing process. A gust of wind or a sharp rock. You can do everything right, and yet things go wrong on Mars. Fly through the atmosphere in five or four... So we are looking for signs of the vehicle. Mars has now reached the top of Mars' atmosphere. We are now at an altitude of 120 km. - and flies at a speed of 19,617 kilometers per hour. You follow what is happening and hope for the best. Parachute deployed. The spacecraft is sending signals that it's doing everything it's supposed to do - - down to the actual landing. The signal indicates that we are jumping. This is a really good sign. We've seen a radio signal. Bounce on the roof. One moment for all. We can't see any signal now. But then there was silence. Please Wait. For a long time we did not hear anything from the ship. The tracking system is still looking for the signal. It was a very intense period. We wait... as if the spacecraft had died. Then the signal comes. The whole room goes crazy. You have already succeeded. After a few hours, the pictures started pouring in. Spirit was an international celebrity. Chance was due to arrive three weeks later. For a while, everything went according to plan on Mars. Everything works. All devices worked, all running processes worked. The rover did what we asked of it. Everything went according to plan. But 18 days into the mission, it all stopped. I can't see anything on the screens. Is there a sign? no. Receive. Let's keep looking for it. After 18 days, everything calmed down. We didn't hear anything from the car. We had no idea what happened. Just calm down. So that was a problem. Normally, Spirit talks to JPL over the Deep Space Network every day. Earth sent instructions and data came from Mars. Until I stopped, for two long days. also ... The flight station sees signals from ... Some faint signals from the soul. The first clues about what was happening. After a day or two it turned out that - - For inexplicable reasons - - Turn off the computer and restart it on the board again and again. And I did it at night. This means that the computer was draining the batteries. At night, it does not receive any solar energy, and then the batteries are discharged. The car can only survive for a few days. So we were in a death spiral. There were black clouds over JPL that night. Spirit wasn't the only one in danger. The opportunity was just a few days away. - So the team checked data from Spirit's lander - - to see if everything went according to plan. We saw something unexpected. We saw that something was wrong. The lander took longer than expected to reach its position. Spirit got away with it, but perhaps the chance wasn't so fortunate. Of course, it must be investigated - - To find out what went wrong. Full team work around the clock - - by testing the vacuum chamber and trying to understand what happened. But we couldn't, because we ran out of time. They can only open the parachute early - To gain more time on the road. This means that it had to be propagated higher at higher speeds - - which increases the stress of the parachute. 48 hours before landing, we're talking about changing detection parameters. So it can unfold high so that it does not fall. It was worrying. I didn't sleep well last night because I kept thinking about this. Imagine if we got two disasters. All the great excitement and then lose it all. They sent new instructions to the opportunity. — with less than 24 hours left, and hope for the best. We think there are problems with the software. They found a pattern in the control room. - In the signs sent from the soul. The rover is only sending us data in real time. In other words, he tells us what is happening to him now. Don't tell anything about what happened before. A software bug could force a soul - In an endless cycle of crashing and restarting. So they came up with something that goes beyond memory. - A trip, please. Receive, mission. Receive the flight. Wait for my signal. Three, two, one, sign. It was just a guess. An educated guess, but nothing more. Maybe that will help. Ace flight, we're locked in to 145414. And it worked. Like a well oiled machine, right? With a software patch, Spirit will soon be working again. We have partial control of the vehicle. Now we can talk to the car so that it reacts appropriately. He has regained his sanity and feels relieved. Now was the hour of truth as to opportunity. We start reviewing accidents. It hits the top of the atmosphere. The umbrella spreads. All the way down to the roof. We hear nothing from the ship. It spins around, antennas pointing in all directions. Then we hear something. For the team! I'd like us to go to the press conference together. When the soul descends... ...the team was denied access to the press conference - - Because it was full. This time I said no. "We'll go there together." When we arrived there were guards. They wanted to stop us from entering. You can not. I said sorry.” Then we went over there. Lebanon Electricity Corporation! Lebanon Electricity Corporation! Lebanon Electricity Corporation! For our Mars rover team. They are the best in the world. Spirit and Opportunity finally find themselves on Mars. But now they had to deliver the goods. The mission was to last only 90 sols, which is 90 Martian days. Dust on solar panels was the biggest threat. But you can die in many ways on Mars. You never know when they'll drop dead. It could happen tomorrow. They could be dead now without us even knowing it. great. JPL's roaming teams treated each sun as if it were their last. Soon we began to look at him as if the thieves were doomed. We knew the clock was ticking - - and that we only have 90 sols, maybe less. The goal was to see if Mars had water for life. It was a frozen desert for a very long time. But the surface is scarred by ancient river channels and deltas. How was it here billions of years ago? How much water was there? What was its chemical composition? Does the microbe like the place? Why? Send the soul to Joseph Crater to the south. Because it looked like a dry lake. - and were hoping to find clues in the rocks. But on the ground there were only volcanic pebbles. I wouldn't admit it then. - But the place where the soul landed was a huge disappointment. We were looking for sedimentary rocks - - that used to lie in an old lake - - but instead there was lava as far as the eye could see. All stones looked the same. And it was all the same. We'll see an impact crater where the impact created a crater. - Down to the good stuff. We spent 50 sols searching - - Then the hole was filled with lava. We were hoping for something more exciting. I don't think we'll go down to the crater. But it is possible. It was really frustrating - - And the Soul Team lost their nerve a bit. Chance got a better start. It landed near the equator at Meridiani Planum. I jumped 400 meters - - and made a hole between the planets. At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, they were waiting for the first pictures. just look! We opened our eyes and saw amazing layers of rock - Right in front of the car. This remote exposure is absolutely amazing. I'm looking forward to getting there. It was like nothing anyone had seen before. Everyone had an idea about Mars - — but we thought, "What the hell is this?" It was completely incomplete. It is an unusual Martian rock compared to other sites. Layers tell us - - They were probably lying in liquid water. We don't know what's going on here, but the good thing is - - Here we have a result that can answer this question - - And in the rover we have tools that can give us the answer. The rover has the same tools as a high-tech geologist. At the end of the arm are devices that can identify metals. They see the world in 3D, with four pairs of stereo cameras. There is a camera for color reviews. Collected from individual photos. Filters bring out details that the human eye can't see. The spectrophotometer scans for potential minerals from the water. They have black and white stereo vision for navigation and planning. And below the surface, fish-eye lenses see Mars from ground level - - He looks forward and backward. Opportunity raced to the outcrops and soon made startling discoveries. It was like being inside a crime novel Alien From Mars - - Where you get a new clue for every sun or two. At first it was little balls the size of a pea - - wedged into the rocks like blueberries in muffins. It was so amazing. what the hell? It turned out to be iron luster. The metal that drew them here to begin with. On Earth, they form balls on rocks submerged in water. Then they found minerals rich in sulfur, which can only form in contact with water. and finally petrified ripples caused by the flow of water - - and froze over time as the sand turned to stone. Everything points back to a time billions of years ago. - Then water, or rather sulfuric acid - - sunk into the ground and sometimes flows across the surface. Mars was a completely new planet. None of us expect to find it. Everything else is a lie. Almost everything was surprising. We were excited, skeptical, and seriously sleep-deprived. It was very stressful - - But we just ran on adrenaline and it was so much fun. I've never had more fun as a researcher. The Opportunity team declared victory and moved on to a new nearby target. While Spirit was still stuck in Joseph Crater Land. They were on opposite sides of the planet, going through two very different experiences. It was hard for them. For a long time, Team Opportunity has been the happy team - - And the Spirit team wasn't too happy. I said they could switch teams, but they wouldn't. Because now they are bent on the success of the soul. Chance was the lucky rover. But Spirit is my favorite rover. - because the soul had to strive for everything in life. Squires taught that the soul must go on - - And the hills on the horizon should save the mission. Columbia Hills is 1.6 miles away - The vehicle is designed to travel 600 meters in its lifetime. This is four times the distance for which it was built. It's a long distance. We didn't know if that was possible. The engineers were skeptical. I remember when he said that. "We're going there." "Do you want to climb through the hills?" "It will take more than 90 days." "We die on the way there." He said, "No, we do." "Okay, you have the keys. Good luck." We are 100 sols on Mission 90. Warranty has expired. Our only chance to find something new - - He was pushing the car harder than it was built for. Otherwise, we will find nothing but lava. As Spirit walked to Columbia Hills - Opportunity faced a new challenge. The Endurance Pit scared the life out of me the first time I saw it. As we headed to the edge, there were vertical cliff faces. If we record that - - Then the rover could fall and die. But the exposed bedrock was an irresistible target. You are the best. It's a completely new mission. Deep rocks allow you to see further into the past. We didn't bring a drilling rig to Mars. - But Mars drilled us these amazing holes. It is our window to what is below the surface. Everyone wanted to go there. We stood on the brink of the coolest thing anyone has ever seen on Mars - - with a rover we think it can handle. Everyone wanted to go down into the hole, but we wanted to do it right. What is the motive? The problem was not getting off. The question was whether opportunity could return. Because rovers aren't built to climb. We never tested what you could handle. Only if you meet the requirements. We had to convince management that - - We will not destroy it or strive for it. If we can't safely climb rocks at a slope of 25 degrees - - Then we will not go down into the pit. Everyone had to agree to the decision. If something goes wrong, people shouldn't be able to say - - He didn't ask them. "I said no." I wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the idea. 15 up, 10 down. First they did some tests. Actually it climbed well. I was amazed at how well they could climb as long as there were rocks. 30-32 degrees... I managed it without problems. In June 2004, NASA gave the go-ahead to descend into Endurance Crater. The fate of opportunity is now in the hands of the drivers - - The privileged few at JPL who have taken control of the rovers - - And the scientists' orders were translated into instructions that the robot could understand. They spent time immersed in a virtual landscape on Mars - - Created by Thief Cams. One of the most incredible things is that you feel your presence there. If you were standing in that place on Mars right now, you would see this. We have built a vehicle with human characteristics. They are human height and have normal vision. You develop a sense of touch almost what it's like to touch Mars. We no longer work with a remote controlled robot. We're in it. We are on Mars. It could take up to 20 minutes for radio signals to reach Mars. - so it can be controlled in real time. You're programming the rover. It is not a joystick. "Drive ten meters forward. Turn five degrees." "Watch out for obstacles." They won't know how the drive went until the photos arrive the next day. The rover's safety depends on doing it right. No one controls the camera. - who drives the rover up a cliff. They are the drivers. No one is more nervous about what happens to thieves. You think, "I told the rover what to do." "If something goes wrong, it's my fault." The soul had bulls for eight weeks - - through a lava field at the foot of the Columbia Hills. There may be a dividend payout at the top of the hill - - But getting there will be quite a challenge. Spirit's solar panels, its only source of power, were dusty - - and only produced half the energy. Just around the corner waiting for its first winter on Mars. We didn't expect to survive the winter. We reach the foot of the Columbia Hills after 156 days - - On a mission that should have lasted 90. Seasons have changed. Spirit is located in the southern hemisphere of Mars. This means that in winter the sun is lower in the northern sky - - It comes farther and farther. That means less energy than the sun, unless we can invent something. It would be helpful if they could tilt the panels to get more energy from the sun. We didn't have a built in tilt mechanism. We can only tilt it toward the sun by tilting the entire rover. But the good thing is we now have a hill. Did they follow a path that tilted the panels towards the sun - - So maybe Spirit can survive the winter and climb the mountain at the same time. They had to stay on the course for at least seven months. Mars' orbit around the Sun takes two Earth years. So the winters on Mars are twice as long. But now they have a chance. We are beginning to realize that there may be more life out there than we thought. Chance spent her first winter - - on a sunny slope inside Endurance Crater. Rock samples from the crater wall gave a greater depth of time. - for the water stories in Meridiani. Salty, acidic waters flooded the Earth probably for several million years. When summer came again, it was time to travel. But he was away from the crater into something completely different. The closest target was six kilometers to the south. A huge crater called Victoria. It was deeper and gave the opportunity to look further back in time. We thought, "Can we get there? It's six kilometers to the south." Remember, it's six times as far as the rover was made for. But it looked like an easy drive - - so they hit the screw on the head and headed for Victoria Crater. Spirit has been climbing the hills of Columbia for half a year - - and survived the first winter with solar panels tilted toward the sun. But now they are so dusty - - just the inability to store enough energy to survive the cold nights. She was losing more and more energy - - It seemed to fade with the end of the soul. But then, a beautiful day - - A gust of wind hit the car and cleaned the solar panels from dust - - and suddenly our rover was like new again. It was pure luck. Spirit sent this photo of his deck before cleaning... .. And this is immediately after cleansing. We get a new life. We have more energy than we can use. We must turn off the car so as not to overheat it. This is how much energy you produce. surprising. We got the car up at night and took pictures of the stars and moons. We've done absolutely incredible things. We look at the stars. We explore another world and look at the stars at night. It added a whole new dimension to our experience. It gave us an idea of ​​what Martian nights are like. With energy saved, Spirit now had a chance to reach the top, Husband Hill. Everyone who worked on Spirit wanted to make this happen. It's no longer about the water, it's about climbing the hill. Spirit became a mountaineer. Now she has the opportunity to do something no one else has done before. The spirit can become the first to reach the top of a mountain on another planet. With the rise of the soul, opportunity ran into a problem - - on what should have been an easy ride to Victoria Crater. It was a gentle, sloping sand dune as far as the eye could see. There were no rocks or hazards in sight. We thought you could drive here blind. We traveled with a technology that can probably be described as - Like drifting with your eyes closed. - Navigate here. - to talk. We can see the path the rover thinks it took... On Sol 446, everything suddenly stopped. Pictures of the previous day appeared on the screen - - And the wheels of opportunity were buried in the deep sand. The wheels pierced the surface and kept turning. We thought we were still sailing smoothly across Meridiani Planum - —but instead, we just dug ourselves deeper and deeper into the sand. 80 percent of the wheels fell into the sand. It was a potential death trap. - And it took some time to find a solution. The first rule in such a situation is that you should not do anything stupid. It didn't go further than here. What should have happened at all - - But let's not make it worse by guessing the solution. At JPL they built Martian dunes - - and I tested different sand recipes to get the right texture. Then they retrieve the experimental rover and spend two weeks coming up with an escape plan. The best method, they found, was to step back and give it a full pedal. You can't search for that kind of thing - - You just have to try it. On the Mars rover, "full throttle" is in slow motion. The wheels should have turned about 192 meters - - To move the vehicle one meter. It took several days. The wheels spin eight metres, and then you see they've moved that far. On Sol 484, Chance finally broke free from the trap. Trials in the Dunes dubbed "Purgatory" - It was Chance's first encounter with death. It wasn't going to be the last. In September 2005, after more than a year of climbing - - the spirit reached the top of the hill of the pair. Standing on top of the hill you have now occupied - - and looks at the world around him. I love her for giving it to us. More than anything, I felt very lucky. "We just climbed a mountain on Mars. Wait." From above they chose the next target. low plateau house panel - - With a slope suitable for sunshine for the coming winter. After 165 suns, the spirit passed home plate - - As winter approached, the car drove towards McCall's Hill. We spent last winter climbing Husband Hill. So we'd drive up to McCall's Hill and face the sun - - And he did the same as last winter. But then it happened that the right front wheel gave way. I have stopped spinning. It happened at a bad time, because we were trying to climb the hill - - which would have been impossible without that wheel. At JPL, they experimented with five-wheel drive. It was easier to drive backwards and pull out the dead wheel. But it knocked the rover off course, making driving difficult. We only had an hour of energy each day. - and I had to write a complex string, sometimes with 400 instructions - - Just to drive five metres. When you get a shopping cart with a stuck wheel - - And try to drive into the supermarket - - So it's very similar to this - - But the soul is a distant planet and it is controlled by the keyboard. We have to learn to drive again. Seasons change, there's less energy - - People get nervous, and then we get stuck. We hit some quicksand and couldn't break free. We thought, "Are we stuck? The rover is dying here?" We race against time - Because there were only three weeks until Spirit didn't have enough energy to- - to survive the night. People talked about her as if she was already dead. In less than a week they saved a soul. But by then it was too late to reach McCall Hill. I'm beginning to realize that my dreams of managing - - Keeping the craft moving and exploring more is dead. Forget what is a few hundred meters. We never get there. What is right next to us? They find a place nearby where they can tilt the rover slightly toward the sun. That was it. We stood there for seven months. But we survived. When summer came again, Spirit was on the move again - - and pulled the dead wheel back until it dug a hole. One day we were walking in a small valley. We looked at gutter pics - - And there was a place where the earth was white as snow. caught our attention. It turns out that it contains more than 90 percent pure silica. It's not quartz, it's not beach sand. It is amorphous silica. It reminds us of opals. Suddenly we realize that we have discovered something completely new - - Which we haven't seen before. On Earth, this type of silica is formed in hot springs - - or volcanic steam stacks. The cool thing is that you can visit hydrothermal systems on Earth - - It is full of microbial life. We don't know if there is. We didn't have the tools to investigate it. But such an environment may have shaped the framework - About some powerful microbes. This makes it a very important place. 1,200 days of his 90-day mission - - Spirit made his greatest discovery. It probably wouldn't have happened without the broken wheel. In September 2006, after nearly two years on the plain of Meridiani - - Chance to reach the edge of Victoria Crater. The crater is 800 meters wide. Five times the stamina. The view when we got to the edge was unlike anything we'd seen before. It was like getting to the Grand Canyon. You know it's there, but you can't prepare for it. Millions of years of Mars' history can be detected in these rocks. But to read it they had to come close. Opportunity went on a reconnaissance mission for about a year. A daring drive along the steep edge of the crater wall. We literally balance a vehicle with millions - On the edge of a cliff on another planet. If you can drive all the way to the edge - - Then you can shoot with the camera until the next promontory - - which is probably only 30-50 meters away - - and see a wonderful exposed rock wall. But then you have to go to the edge. We stand on the brink - Here's what happens if we're not careful. Our job is to make sure we stay on this page. I passed. Along the way, the orbiter took a picture from a height of 300 km - — that showed off Opportunity's daring driving paths. That picture shows, to me, one of the greatest accomplishments - - In the history of planetary robotics. To be able to lead that journey over and over again - - When researchers say: "We need to get closer." It was an absolutely incredible journey. Seven months later, they had seen enough from above and were ready to drive into the hole. The best way down seems to be where they got to the crater. So, the opportunities are back where they came from - - And in the path of a serious storm. Weather isn't usually an issue on Mars, with one major exception. Once every two or three years, there is a huge dust storm. It didn't happen during our first summer. Not even during our second summer. But it happened in the third summer. It turned into a global storm that surrounded the entire planet. If you where the chance - - So you can't see the sun if you look up. The amount of direct sunlight reaching the solar panels - - It was less than one percent of the amount that arrives on a clear day. At JPL they shut down all but the most important systems - - to save energy. They were not built to survive a dust storm. Solar powered vehicles. They need sunlight to survive. So we would turn things off every day to save energy. But you can't turn everything off, because you have to keep the rover warm. Part of what keeps the car warm is the use of the computer. So the balance was tricky - - Between using computers enough to keep warm - - But don't drain the batteries. So we were on the brink of disaster. On the far side of Mars, the dust wasn't so heavy. For once the soul had fewer problems. But at Victoria Crater, Chance was in big trouble. And soon it will have so little energy that it will automatically shut off - - so that there is enough sunlight to recharge the batteries. Within a few days it could be fatal. It's like sitting at someone's deathbed. - And he waited, and waited, and thought: "Will you stay?" "Can she still talk to us?" It was very painful. In the end, you can't even gauge how bad it is. You can just sit back and watch. Ran out of things to try. Almost everyone has lost hope. But then he began to clarify - — and six weeks of trials are finally over. She was still lucky - - Then a gust of wind cleaned the boards of opportunity - - And she can continue to work. At Gusev Crater, Spirit weathered the storm. But when the dust settled, I buried - - And winter was approaching again. We had to find a place for Spirit and try to survive the third winter. Back then the rover was very dirty - - That an inclination of 12 degrees would not suffice. We needed 30 degrees, and the rover couldn't climb that far. The only option was to drive across the Home Plate to the northern edge - - where Spirit can back to the edge and tilt the solar panels. We had 40 days to get there. Because of the power situation, we couldn't drive every day. - And don't drive away with a broken wheel. So we had to take advantage of the time. So we started crossing the Home Plate to get to the place - - and drove hard into a sand trap. They called it Tartarus, the bottom of Hell. A deep microcrater filled with sand, just too much for the five Wheels of Spirit. We were really in trouble. The two rear wheels were raised above the ground, so they could not be used at all. The right front wheel was dead. So the six-wheeled car now only had three good wheels. There was one last escape route they could try. But it was on the verge of home. The slightest miscalculation on the road can tip the Spirit over the edge. We've tried every trick. If you don't succeed, the job may be over. We sent the instructions to the rover. Not many of us slept that night. sol 1388. I will always remember that. Perhaps the most defining motive on which the soul was working. And it worked. We left Tartous and crossed the house plate. Carefully climb down the steep slope. Because of this, we have a chance to survive the third winter on Mars. Rovers are now very old. gout sufferers - - And you don't see well anymore because the cameras are covered in dust - - which blurs their vision. They've tried a lot. The dangers they went through and we went through them... It's like any relationship. You go through a lot together, which strengthens the relationship. We feel closely connected with vehicles. They are our bodies. We are on Mars through them. When we were children, we dreamed that one day we could walk on other planets. We can see ourselves in the Rovers. They have been going on for a long time. You get the feeling that they are designed. Selection in a pile of metal. That's how you feel. Above all, they move across the landscape - - With the ability to do what a person does. Stop, look around, and say, "Hot. Let's go over there." In September 2008, after 700 sols in the Victoria Crater - Chance took off on what seemed like an impossible journey. 11 kilometers across the plain to a larger crater called Endeavor. It was crazy, but what were we going to do? We finished in Victoria. We went up from there and there was more of the same in every direction. Endeavor Crater seemed so far away - — but it was the only goal I felt worthy of the rover. So we went. Slope behind home plate towards the sun - Spirit survived its third winter on Mars. It was still covered in dust so the solar panels provided very little power - - But it's time to move on. Spirit was on the north side of the Home Plate. The researchers wanted to explore the southern region. The problem for the drivers was getting where the researchers wanted to go. The shortest path was via Home Plate. But with a broken wheel, Spirit can never climb the slope again. They attempted the eastern flank, but ran into soft ground and had to turn back. They had to take the long way through uncharted terrain. On Sol 1886, they headed south along the western side of the Home Plate. It looked like solid ground. But it was just a thin crust that suddenly slipped away. The wheels started turning on the soft floor. - and we couldn't get traction. We were driving a hit car through difficult terrain and we knew it. We knew that such a trap was waiting for us there. That's why we preferred not to go there. But we had to. Every time we got stuck, we knew it might be over. But this time it was worse than most. There is a lot of tension. It's hard for all of us. If there is a solution, we will find it. But it is a very difficult situation. Several months later, Spirit was still stuck. A new winter was approaching and the rover was in a dangerous place - - With the solar panels facing away from the sun. Time was running out. After a lot of testing, we came up with a plan - - and was ready to test it on Mars. But then another wheel got stuck. The right front wheel was already dead - - And with two dead wheels you didn't get anywhere. it's over. In March 2010, Spirit did not call home for a scheduled liaison session. The rover was starving for energy and may have gone into hibernation. No heat to survive, no contact. She was just waiting for the summer sun to recharge her. Until then, we had high hopes and hope you will fulfill them. In September 2010, spring returned to Gusev crater - - along with the possibility of a spirit awakening and calling home. We are in the process of a massive rescue effort. We send instructions to the rover, hoping for a response. They sent over a thousand instructions over the next ten months. Instructions sent. It will take 4.5 minutes. Monitoring the channels of the Deep Space Spirit Network. - and listens for any signal. There is a possible signal that we are trying to find. Receive. They thought they succeeded. John? We have a possible signal. Soul has saved himself many times. Nobody thought that she wouldn't survive this time either. Not this time. In the spring of 2011, Spirit was silent for more than a year. I've missed her for so long and it's hard to say: "The last time I heard from her was the last time ever." People are slitting their fingers, but I think they have to realize -- The soul's time on Mars may be over. They listened at intervals of half a year. But the soul's mission is over. Her final resting place on Home Plate is a full eight kilometres. — from the landing site on the other side of the Columbia Hills. I've always felt that the only honorable way to lose a rover - - that would wear them out. This is what happened to the sprite. In the end it no longer works. This means that we extracted everything we could from our own creation. It is an honorable death. The other thing that made it possible - - We had to continue working with Opportunity the next day. We still have a live rover. Soul quest completed. —but opportunity was still creeping across the plains of Meridiani. In 2011, she was seen on the edge of a small crater called Santa Maria - ... 27 kilometers from the original landing site ... ...with many kilometers to go on the long trek to Endeavor Crater. It's been three long years. Day after day after day... The only thing that broke the monotony was an occasional meteorite rock. Some of the most memorable photos - - Opportunity should look back - To where we came from. There is a feeling of the immensity of Mars ... The feeling of being away from home. The poor rover is a long way from its source. - but he still has yet to drive to his next destination. Like a captain's log, cameras filmed - The Long Journey to Endeavor Crater. It was very reminiscent of how to imagine - - A ship that has been sailing for a very long time. We traveled across a smooth sea - - And out there like an island in that sea - He could see Endeavor Crater's edge approaching. I felt down to earth. When we arrived, everything changed. It was like a new landing place and a new mission. It was a breakthrough for us. Big breakthrough. Now we see a completely new geology and geology. The most interesting thing was - We found concentrated deposits of clay minerals. Clay tells a very different story about water. Mud tells a story about water you can drink. With a neutral pH. Which water was more suitable - Not only to sustain life, but also to create life. Chance spent the next seven years - - Explore Endeavor Crater's Edge. In February 2018, it reached 5,000 sols on Mars. Like a car that runs a million on the odometer without changing the oil. never heard of it before. We still don't understand how it can go on for so long. In June, chance descends into a valley in the crater wall - - When a violent dust storm hit. Much worse than the one I survived 11 years ago. The sky was completely dark. There is no sunlight, so there is no energy. Eventually, the rover drained its batteries and fell silent. Without electricity and heat at minus 70 degrees. Smaller rover might survive - - But the chance is no longer small. There is a big difference between - - his teenage nephew who goes out in the winter without a jacket - - and then your 97-year-old grandmother who does. Don't worry about the teenager, but you are with the granny. This is the situation here. Three months later, the storm began to subside. If you get the chance - - And the sun recharges the batteries - - Should the rover wake up and call home. But there can be a lot of dust on the panels - - This opportunity will be closed again before you can submit. Unlikely, but we'll make a point - - So we send instructions hoping to catch up with the rover when it wakes up for a while - - and before it closes again. We ask the rover to send us a signal. This is a wideband receiver that listens for whatever comes in. We should see a column here in the middle. This is our rover talking to us. The boards may be so dusty that Opportunity can't get up for a while. That may change in the coming months as the wind season returns on Mars. If it's really dusty, we know it's going to explode - - And we've seen the RVs cleaned up every year - — and that might be enough to reawaken Opportunity. But it's Mars, so we don't know for sure. We just have to wait and see. Done and no signal. So it was today. We'll try again tomorrow. They wanted to prove that Mars is worth exploring, no matter the risks. Spirit and Opportunity has changed the way we perceive Mars. When one's perspective is constantly changing... ...then you explore as a human does. This was our first impression of what it looked like. Finding water on the surface... ...means we had to go back. We've landed other missions on Mars - - And work on additional tasks on the roof. And all of this is a true thanks to spirit and chance. After eight months of silence - There was still no indication that Opportunity had weathered the storm. In February 2019 - - Just over 15 years since Opportunity landed on Mars - - NASA announced that its mission is over. Spirit and Opportunity have permanently opened the borders of Mars. And now they will spend eternity on a planet that hasn't changed much - - for billions of years. it's cold. It is dry, there is no vegetation. They won't rust or anything. They may still be there - - With shiny aluminum surfaces in a million years. It will last for a very long time. Longer than most things humans have ever built. Thanko u for watch
