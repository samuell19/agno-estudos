Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - Hey, same place, yeah? - Okay. You bastards, why are you guys playing soccer in the alley? What a cranky hag! Right, I found a great rooster. I'm serious. He's on a winning streak of five. So do you want him or not? Stop fooling around. It's a deal then? Alright! - Beverage! - Don't run in the… - Hey, let's buy some beverage. - Uncle Phu, four cups, please! Four cups? Take them. Here is your ice. - More, please, more. - Okay. More. Okay, be careful. Here. Beautiful. Fifty cents for four cups. What? One cup is ten cents, shouldn't four cups be 40 cents? - Here, is this enough for 50 cents? - There you go. - Wait, the ball. - Go away, hurry up. - Hey Phu, one milky coffee! - Okay, I'm coming! Hey, that's mine. I'm coming. - Alright, deal the cards… - Pay up, dude. Hey, pay up. What's taking you so long? Your cigarette. - Your coffee. - Leave it there. - Too small. - Too small… Too small… - God a mm it, you're bad luck, Phu. - Hey, it's you who picked bad cards! My cards were great until you showed up. It was because of your unlucky hands. - You're too noisy. Eight points. - I just got here. I'll be taking the money now. - Taking what? - What else? - What are you trying to take? - You guys swapped the cards, didn't you? Kiss my ass, you want me to beat you up? - Give me your money. - Give me your money. Give me your pocket money. Don't let me see you around. Watch your backs. Sore loser. - Give me money. - Here. - It was because of the cards. - Deal the cards, please. Don't blame others. Ouchie! What are you doing? Can't you see the road? Hey, calm down. - What's the number? - 79, God of Fortune. - Are you sure? - Guaranteed. Freeze. What are you selling? Let me check. Ouch. Please let me go. This is my first time. I've been following this case for a long time. No way out for you. Goddammit. - Why so unlucky…? - Stop. I'll fight you tooth and nail, fatty. - Stop. - Hey, it's Uncle Thai. Run! Stop. Stop. - Help me catch him. - Hey, that money's mine. - Ouch… God… - What? Help me get him. The long-haired dude. - Damn, stop! - Damn, you want to steal my money? There is no thief here. Hey, if you want to buy it, then buy it. If not, leave. Don't call me a thief. I have never stolen. Aren't you afraid of karma? - What? - Stop running. - Over there. - Stop. Stop running. Where are you running to? Hey, it's my bike. Son of a bitch. Asshole, I'm still paying for that bike. Give it back. - Give back my bike. - Where are you driving to? - Ouch! God! You dumb-ass. - Quick. Crap, dumb-ass. It hurts so bad. Dammit, my bike. Hey fat-ass, let me go. Hey, Cu Li, pass me the ball. - Thanks, bro. - Phu. Can't believe you're that useless. Give me back my bike, asshole. Where are you driving to? Get off me. Shoo. - Hey, I'm going to fall down… - Give me back my bike. I'm still paying for that bike. Give it back! Bastards, you want to burn this place down? My bike. Thief! Let me go, I won't steal from here again. Horrible. Mom, Dad. Uncle Thai. Where is your territory? Do you have accomplices? I can't breathe. Let me go to the hospital first then I'll tell. Are you kidding me? Look at him. He's much older than you but he's fine. You're this young and you want to go to the hospital? He knows martial arts, I don't. Again? Police impersonation is illegal, you know that, right? - But… - But you're retired. Not settling into retirement life, yeah? If you keep doing this, our bosses will find out and think we're out of our depth. I know. But I saw that you guys were busy, so I tried to help. I know our job is hard. Everyone knows our job is extremely easy if everyone knows their place. Right? - Little bit too easy, huh? - Okay, just skip that part. This is more important: What if something happens to you? What are we going to tell your daughter? Oh no. MY BABY GIRL I'm here. I'm on my way. Wait for me. - Thai. - What? Here's your wallet. Promise me this is the last time. Okay. Did you have to wait long? I called you an hour ago, and then another hour after that, so two hours in total. Something came up so I was late. I can tell just by looking at you. Next time anything happens, just call the police, why do you have to keep on living like this? I know. You always say that. How about you buy me an electric bike like Thu's, so that you don't have to drive me around anymore? Driving a bike is too dangerous. Let me drive you around. Are you sure? You're always busy. What am I busy with? Busy caring about other people's business. Hush, not again. You must find it for me. It's important to me. You have to find it by any means. You know me: 1 means 1, and 2 means 2. Let's divide into 3 groups. One goes this way, two goes in the middle. Report, sighting of targets. MY BABY GIRL Get ready. Hoang is not here yet. We act when we see him. They're cunning, I'm afraid we'll be late. All units move. - Freeze. - Hands up. Hands up. Nothing. Hoang. Hoang is downstairs. - After him. - Roger. - Get off the car. - Hands up. What's wrong, Dad? Nothing. Right, to dance the Paso Doble without the limited edition 2012 Latin shoes is like broken rice without fish sauce. Get them for me. Hey, what's the driver's name? Hau, that's Hoang's bag. We couldn't find any evidence of drugs so we couldn't convict Hoang. He was released half a year ago. We got someone to keep an eye on him but nothing suspicious came up so we closed the case. KHANH HOANG REAL ESTATE COMPANY REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE BUSINESS Thai, are you going to buy land over there? You keep looking that way. I've been here many times but I've just realized there's a real estate company there. Right, they moved here more than a month ago. - Bay? - What? Do you need a delivery man? What? Hire me, I'll deliver far and wide, near and dear. You can just relax, huh? I understand. Hard times, so everyone needs a job, but my kids just bought a house in Can Gio and keep telling me to move there. I'm thinking of selling but I don't know when my kids are going to force my hand. Okay, then please give me my bill. It's okay. We're friends. It's on me this time. I'll come back tomorrow. - Sure, but I'll bill you tomorrow. - Okay, sure. Your Pho is coming! Why didn't you follow in Grandpa's footsteps and make pho? His restaurant was very famous. Because I wanted to become a policeman. But don't forget I was the one who taught your mom how to cook this dish. You too, the more you do it, the better your Pho gets. Delicious! Phu, she invited you too? Come here. Quickly. Sit down. It's the middle of the night, what's going on? Help me bring this bonsai home. It's too heavy. Don't you have anything else to steal? Does your Grandpa's alter need decorations? This tree's worth $300. $300 divided by 3, each of us can get $115. What kind of calculation is that? - Did you go to school? - No. If you didn't go to school, don't try to argue with someone who did. Can you make it $100 for me? - Okay. - Can't believe it. Hurry up, bring it home. - Hold on, let me unlock the door. - Here, let me help you. - Can't believe you can't do it. - I really don't know… What? It's Thai. Hey, hurry up. - Caught you on the spot. - You've been arrested. Get down here. What are you doing? Caught you red-handed. - No, no it's not what you think. - What? What? So that's the reason you watched us, so you can just do it alone? Retired policeman, huh? What are you doing? Sneaky little bitch. Only seven points, man. Only seven points. Wow, what an ass. Wait… I see… A man of culture. - God, control yourself. - Stop it. You are the ones who have to control yourselves. You're too old for this shit. - We're going to tell My. - You think I care? - Do you? - You all shut up. Listen, do you see that restaurant across the street? Bay's restaurant. I'm about to buy that restaurant. Drop by if you're free. What does that mean? Why did he sneak into this place when he wanted to buy that restaurant? Let him be. If he has a restaurant, it's easier for us to do our job. Forget about it, we're here already. Let's continue our game. - Okay. - Yeah, let's continue. Half and one dollar bet. Buying what restaurant? - What do you mean? - Oh, you didn't know? Oh, I got it. He doesn't want to run a business. He just wants to stalk girls. My is here. What are you talking about? We have to let her know the truth. Poor girl is oblivious. He's still single. I haven't said anything. - I don't know anything. - Haven't said what? Your attitude will get someone in trouble. Buying a restaurant is not as easy as buying veggies. It's not a one-day business. We have to think clearly. Also, Mr. Bay… Doesn't want to sell his restaurant. - Right. - Right. I'm still doing well. Why do I have to sell my restaurant? - Mr. Bay. - What? You're wrong. - What do you mean? - Come here. - What? - Stop what you're doing. Come sit down. - What? - My, come here too. Talk it out, now or never. Mr. Bay, Mr. Thai told us about your kids. Your kids want to pay you back, but if you don't let them, they'll resent you. You would force them to be bad children. How could they face other people in society? Their friends would ask them what happened to their dad? What will they say? They wouldn't dare tell anyone they couldn't take care of you. And then what would happen next? Depression. Desperation. Oh my God, bankruptcy, they can't work anymore. And down the rabbit hole they go. Wow, didn't know his business meant that much to his children's lives? Yeah, it does mean that much. What do your kids do? Let me go home and ask them. Business owners. CEOs. You don't care about your kids at all. If their business partners ask them what their father does, they would say, "He sells rice." - "Selling rice" … - Gosh! Gosh, how could they face other people then? - Wouldn't that be depressing? - It's extremely depressing. - Isn't it sad? - Extremely sad. - Down the rabbit hole? - It's a deep, deep hole. Oh gosh! I never thought my kids would suffer that much. I think they are right, Thai. Okay, I'll sell this restaurant. If I sold it to someone else, it would be $4,400, but because you're my brother, it's only $3,500. - Mr. Bay! - What? I would like to share this… I'm saving for My's tuition. If I pay with those savings, it would only be $1,300. - Huh? - What… Who would sell for that amount? You see. I'll sell. For $1,300. You only need to give me $1,100, you can keep $200 to redecorate the restaurant. So you can keep the business running! Deal. - Mr. Bay, check, please. - Coming. You should look for helpers now. I'll give you the key this afternoon. So… what just happened? Did he sell the place for such a low price? What if he's ill? Hey, I still don't know who got fleeced. You three are the worst in this area. What now? Do you want to have broken rice or prison food? - Of course we want broken rice. - Deal. Salary will be paid at the end of the month. - You work first and get paid later. - Wait. No salary for us. Hey, are you stupid? You don't need money? - No. - Of course not, just salary. Let me explain to you guys. Is he mad or what? Let me enlighten you. We are all employees. - So, what will happen? - Yeah. If we fight with our boss and he kicks us out? - Sometimes he won't pay. Right? - Yeah… But if we have shares, it will be different. Each of us will get 30%. - Great deal. - If each of us get 30%… - Uncle Thai gets 10% right? - Exactly. Why don't you guys go rob a bank? You haven't done jack and you want 30% shares? What's that about? I'll give 10% to each of you. Take it or leave it. Wait… Another offer. 15%… For three of us. Deal. 15% for three of you. Wait… You three stay and clean up. I'll go now. Phu… Uncle Thai… Hold on… - Phu. - Hey, enjoy. We'll be business owners soon. Only 15% 15% for three of us. What do you want? Hey, calm down. Listen to me. What did he say? He said 10%, which means you had 10%, I had 10%, he had 10%… So, I say we have 15% in total. What else do you want? But your 15% is smaller than his 10%. - The 10% is different from 15%. - What is the difference? 10% is bigger than 15%, Phu. It's elementary math, and you still got it wrong. - Did you go to school? - No. Shut up. Did you go to school? Dropouts shouldn't argue with the class president. Now stop talking, and return the tree. Business owners can't be imprisoned. And you, stay back and clean up. Enjoy! We'll be business owners soon. Shit. Why didn't I go to school now that I have to listen to this dude? - Screw you. - How dare you? Do you want to work or not? Be careful or I'll cut your shares. Hurry up. Oh, wow, so beautiful. It's only $200 but you made the restaurant look so much better. The restaurant looks much cleaner and brighter than when I was the owner. Here is my gift to you. - Hey. - What? You ass, my bike is scratched. Your bike is a handful to drive. - Then don't borrow it. - Uncle Thai. They didn't have any more pork ribs. But luckily, I have other ingredients. I got the beef ribs for the price of the pork ribs. Isn't that great? We can't sell broken rice with beef spare ribs, you dumb-ass. Are you crazy? They only have pork spare ribs broken rice. What is that? Ah, I bought it to make scallion oil for the broken rice. How could we make scallion oil from a leek? I'll chop you like I do with a scallion. Just make whatever with it. You are so picky. Behave. Relax. I'll stay and help you today. I can taste the food and give you a review. - Alright? - Of course. Coming in. What is it? Why is the meat coming off? - The cow died in vain. - You must be sad. This is Tai-Chi beef. We have softness in harness, and harness in softness. Luckily my teeth are still good. What is that? I'm afraid you'll be shocked. I've been shocked enough. I have nothing to lose now. To be honest… I'm already dead. And what is the name of this dish? Dark-night-beef-spare-rib. Cows sleep at night. Fine, let me cover her up so she doesn't get cold. Three dishes down, one to go. - How would you know? - Try it. - No. - You'll only know when you try. Just one bite. - Try it for Thai. - You won't die eating this. Try it! Gosh, he doesn't care about Uncle's That's face. Just one bite. Pho… broken rice… I have broken rice. - And I have Pho. - What do you like to eat? Pho… broken rice… I want them both. - Oh no. - Swallow it. Why did you force-feed him? Spit it out. We'll be in trouble if anything happens to him. God. So delicious. Hey, bitch. Let me… Can't stop eating. Just one bite and you'll remember it forever. Pho and Broken rice exclusive. Uncle That's beef spare ribs. One of a kind. Just one bite and it reminds you of your parents. A dish rich with emotions. What is it called?

He was a policeman. - What should we do now? - You are lucky today. When my Big Boss is out of jail, he'll be after you. - Go. - Watch out for us. Thu. - What? - Who grabbed your butt? Nothing happened. You took advantage of me. We have to help ones who are in need. Haven't you heard that saving a life is equal to building seven temples? Am I right, Uncle Thai? You don't look like a bad person, what happened? It's not what you think. I was taking a shower, and their Big Boss got in. I dropped the soap. Could you help me pick it up? I was too afraid so I pushed him out. He slipped and then broke two teeth. Two teeth are nothing. If it had been me, I would have broken his whole jaw. Okay, that's enough show-and-tell. - Food, anybody? If not, leave. - Mind your manners. Uncle! I've just got out of jail. Looking for a job is so hard. - Is your restaurant…? - Sorry. We don't accept people with a criminal record. Please leave. What's wrong with you? You don't know what he's been through. Uncle, don't you feel sorry for him? Fine, let's give him a trial period. Yay, thank you so much. - Come on in. I'll show you the work. - Hold on. Let's talk first. - Okay. - Vinh, let's go take a shower. So… Have you been following this case for long? Nothing gets past you. My girlfriend worked as a massage therapist. That guy came and harassed her. I tried everything to get him imprisoned and to avenge her. But life sucks. When I got out, she was already married to another guy. So you are not an undercover cop? I was in jail for fighting a cop. Okay. Try to stay clean. Here, one for each of you. What is it for? You guys are too loud. I get headaches. Use these. How do you use it? Put it here? Looks good. Put it there. Looking good. Does it look good? Uncle Thai, I just met with some food-delivery apps. They said they'll help us run some ads. We also trademarked. Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs. - You only need to sign it. - Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Uncle Thai. I'll give you my online channel. If we go online, it'll be great for business. Great. - Meo, did you see what I did there? - You're great. - Sure I am. - Focus on your work. Stop flirting. Hold up. - Wait. - Two bowls of soup. Two broken rice. - One extra rice, please. - Okay, one extra rice. Wait. Help me. I'm getting dizzy. Two iced teas, please. More ribs. Five hundred and forty dollars… Ah, I forgot, from tomorrow onwards, we will only take groups of four. So, no solo dining. What? It's like supermarkets selling only six-pack products.

Uncle… The next group of four get ready. We'll get a table soon. - Thu. - Yes? These 4 people don't know each other. These two came first, and these two arrived later. Right? They are friends. These two people came first, and scheduled with these two but they arrived late, right? Yeah, we are friends. Ask for each other's numbers and come together next time. Please don't mind him. He's writing something else. - Thu. - More rice, please. Yes. Only people who are taller than 170cm can come in. What do you mean? What now? Why did you raise the price? How do we make profit with only 100 customers a day? Why does he always create weird rules? Doesn't he care about his business? You just ran a red light. License and registration, please. Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs, how may I help you? - Is that Phu? - Yes. Mr. Thai is with us. Please come and bail him out. What? We really don't get you. Our restaurant was packed, and you were caught by the police. Enough, Phu. No discipline here, is there? I think the one who has the least self-discipline is you. Our restaurant was packed. I have to take care of the clients and then I have to help the kitchen. Had to help prepare this and that. It's not just Phu who's busy. I had to grill more than 10 kilograms of meat from morning till night. I can't even talk with all the smoke in my lungs. And you think it's easy for me? Do you know how many dishes Meo and I have to wash a day? More than 100 tables' worth of dishes. I have never done anything in my life that made me worry about my hands. Sometimes I stole with them but… Look at the calluses on my hands. Look. But to be honest, we're strong like bulls. We can work as hard as you want. But your weird rules… Are ruining us. You have to be here… The customers scream at us. Why are you stalking the girl next door? - What? Stop the bullshit! - No need to lie. - What's that? - The girl… Here. You secretly took pictures of her and wiretapped her. - You're smitten. - My needs to know this. Okay. His name is Tran Khanh Hoang. I couldn't catch him last time. It busted my knee. That's why I bought this restaurant. The first reason is that I wanted to gather you all here so you won't go out and make trouble. The second reason is to watch that place. I didn't expect this restaurant to become so popular. And then I could only focus on the restaurant. But I can't follow him anymore. How can you say that? You are taking advantage of us. What if they suspect… And kill us? From the start, you gathered us here just to cover for you. We worked really hard… And put 100% effort to take care of your restaurant, but you only cared for yourself. You are too selfish, you know that? Do you think I'm blind? From the beginning, I knew what you guys wanted when you tried to push me to buy this restaurant. No one would have given you the shares like I did. Did you lose anything? If there had been no restaurant and I wasn't here, what would you guys be doing? A gambler, a street vendor, and a thief? You had nothing. I wanted to catch them. It's good for society, what's so wrong about that? I don't care. So what? That is the police's job. Not yours. And it's also none of our business. Why do you have to make it so hard? Take it or leave it. No need to keep the restaurant open anymore. You go do your job, and I will focus on mine. That's all. Put your money in. Hurry. - Two of hearts! - Pass! Vinh, you got lucky now, join us. - One-to-go, please. - Hold up. - Hurry up, please. - Okay. - No onions, please. - Got it. More veggies. What? Are you cheating? Beat him up. Please let me go. How could I live if I got a $130-fine per pack? - Do you know cigarettes are banned? - Yes… You knew the law but still broke it. Sign here. - Catch her. - Beat the hell out of her. Please bear with me this time. Please. Dare to run? Catch her. - How far is it from here to there? - 45 meters. How long will it take? It takes us 17 seconds to arrive at the gate. - How do we break into it? - Three possible ways. The first way is to use a rope and swing through. The second way is to dig a hole. - The third way… - Is to ring the bell. If we ring the bell, will they let us in? I don't think so. Can we break the lock? Good idea. Break the lock. - What are you doing? - We are investigating. Following your wishes. We agreed with each other yesterday. We decided to close the restaurant, and focus 100% on this case. We are working on a plan to break into their den. No, this restaurant needs to be open. If we close down the restaurant, our cover will be blown. The best cover is the most natural one. Just keep on working. Listen to me. Keep working at the restaurant, and keep looking for evidence. We are humans, not animals. We should just focus on one thing. We can't do both. How are we supposed to live? - I can't do it. - I will die soon. If you can find the evidence, I'll give you each 5% more of the shares. Why didn't you say that at the start? You are the one who understands us the most. - Alright. - Deal, 5%. Deal. Meo. Thank you for always remembering me. Thank you, but I won't take it. I'm not materialistic. Oh gosh, Meo said one sentence… and made us all look bad. You see how stupid you are? Alright, stop discussing it. From now on, you guys have to listen to my orders. - Clear? - Clear. We will follow the motto. Catch criminals first. Business comes second. Catch criminals first. Business comes second. Catch criminals first. Business comes second. Hello. Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs speaking. Five orders. Okay, coming right up. Grill the ribs. Hurry up. Wait, so now does catching criminals or doing business come first? I think money comes first. Meo, let me show you a clip. Look, our clip on TikTok got 1 million views. - Do you think I'm doing well? - Very well. Oh, how is it going? I don't think it's going well. How do we know what they're doing over there if we're over here? We only have one way. We have to be friends with him to investigate. Easy for you to say. But do you know how to execute it? Estás seguro. Our restaurant is closed. - So early? - Oh, hey… We just had a lunch break, we're back now. Please have a seat. The food will be right up. Get the rice. Three people? The rice is here. Here is yours. - Soup, please. - The soup is up. What now? What's next? Do what we do best. Understood. Clean up, play some cards. We don't have too many customers at this hour of the day. - What are you cleaning for? - Let's play some sets. Wait… - Deal the cards. - Let's play. Half and one dollar bet. I don't know how to play Gin Rummy. It's a game for four, if you don't play, who will? - But I don't know how to play. - Just guess. You lose a few sets and you will know how to play. It's just a lunch break Gin Rummy takes too long to play. Just play something simple. How about Three-Card Poker? - Three-Card Poker? - I know how to play that. - How much per set? - Three card poker, $5? Seven points. - Nine points. Thank you. - Placed. - Deal. - Put in. - Nine points. - Triple face cards. My win! Thank you. - Continue. - Let's stop. Just a few sets in and your stomach's hurting already? Y'all bore me? Hey watch it. My office is next door, you guys can just come there to play. Wait, we can gamble in the office? Of course. Okay, then let us come and play there. Our boss will complain if we play here. Sure, I'll call you guys. Don't forget. - Check, please. - Okay, coming right up. Don't forget. Our restaurant is running a Special Promotion, $9 off for our customers. You know how to do business. We still need some advice from a businessman like you. Besides being a businessman, I'm also a dance teacher. You are also a dance teacher? I was busy playing with you guys, I'll bring the plate back later. No worries, I'll come over to get the plate later. Where did you get it? When I was cleaning up the table, I grabbed his phone. - Unlock it. - Why… - It's so hard to hack into a Blackberry. - What now? Sir, you forgot your phone. - Meo's a smart cookie. - Of course, he was in jail. He is not only handsome but he is smart too. What does jail have to do with being smart? Have you ever been in jail? - Not yet. - Shame on you. - Three first. - Seven. The three beat the seven. You're wicked. King. Don't think I'll go easy on you just because you're my bro. - Three-of-a-kind. - You're doomed. Hold on. Four-of-a-kind. I can skip the round here, right. - Here it is. Here. - Thank you. Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs, super good. - Meo, where is Meo? - So stinky. Hey, why are you throwing shrimp paste at their door? Long. Go easy. - Yes. - Where is Meo? There are so many people there. - Stay away, kids. - Leave it to him. His nickname is Mad Dog Long. No one knows what his next move is. Long will take you by surprise. Film it. Film it so anyone who wants to make a scene at your restaurant would have to think again. Long can handle this. He can beat up 25 to 26 guys at once. He has a legendary elbow move. His arms might be out of order, but his legs have been waiting to kick for more than 10 years. They are no match. His leg is broken. It's time for me to shine. Hey, kids… Why don't we relieve our problems by dancing? 911… Call… - You stay put! - Mr. Thai… Please call… Please call 911. Call an ambulance! Remember us, baldy. No need to call, just delete the clip. As you wish. We are here at the renowned Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs restaurant. And this is the one who mainly works on the dish. So, hi there. Can you tell the audience the secret behind such great spare ribs? To make good spare ribs, 10% is based on the ingredients, the remaining 90% depends on these tongs. These tongs help us grab the meat, and we have to do it quick so that the meat is cooked evenly. Stop bullshitting. I'm freaking tired and you're bragging? It's recording. Cut this part out. Welcome to Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs. Please sit. Rice. What would you like to eat? - Shit. - Yeah? - There's a cockroach on the plate. - Oh gosh. Maybe it has just dropped down from up there. I just brought it out. - Change to a new plate, now. - What kind of service is this? Why are there so many cockroaches in here? Wait… you… You are grabbing my arm so hard it hurts! - You want to set us up, don't you? - Ouch. - Help, please. Help. - Hey. Help me grill. Everyone… Look… The fish sauce is too sour. - What do you want? - Look, the knife is rusty. Calm down. - Are you okay? - I'm bleeding. Want to make a scene here? Be careful. Watch for me a bit, can you? Son of a bitch. - Lift him up. - Let's go. Slowly. - I'm not going to make it. - Shut up. You are in the wrong place. Remember my face. This restaurant's going down. - Is he okay? - He didn't watch the road. Are you okay? Sit down, please. Get out there. How was that? I paid the compensation so he withdrew. What? These assholes came and made a scene at our restaurant, and now we have to compensate them? - Go look for him. - Go. Stop it, Thu. - If we can let it go, let it go. - Let it go? I can let it go when they mess with me, but they tried to ruin our restaurant. Right. Don't you care about our restaurant's image? You want to keep the restaurant's image? - Take off the apron and go fight him. - Please, I beg you guys. Meo, come here and help me. You guys should calm down. Wait until nighttime when no one is paying attention, we'll go find them and beat the hell out of them. - Great, Meo. - Good idea, Meo. Stop it. I say stop it. Do you still remember our restaurant's motto? Catching criminals comes first. Business comes second. Hello, this is Long. I'm here. We'll have a party tonight. Come over and join us. Okay. That place has three floors. If we want to investigate, it will take time. We need to have a plan. One, two, three. Cheers. Vinh and Phu organize the game to distract them. Meo, by all means, has to find ways to leave the place early, followed by me and Thu. When the signal is on, Meo immediately turns off the electricity. After the electricity goes off, Phu and Vinh must keep them in the same place, and Meo immediately returns to back us up. Thu stays on the 3rd floor, and I stay on the 2nd floor. In five minutes, we have to find evidence of their crimes. Uncle. Uncle. It's a hypothesis and you're laughing already. What was he thinking about, holding that bunch of onions? - What if he suspects us? - Exactly. We have to have a signal to withdraw safely. So cute. Are you mad? Focus, guys. Listen. Our plan has to be executed precisely and correctly. - Are you all clear? - Clear. Let's do it. Cheers. Enjoy yourselves. Cheers. Hey, why don't we play a few rounds? Sit down, we are drinking. We'll play later. Cheers. Have grilled beef. It's great. Thank you, everyone. I know you never forgot me. What are you guys doing? I'm stuffed so I took off my belt. I knew you were too full to stand so I got you a chair. I drank till the last drop… Any beer left? Pass the cake over, I can help slice it. I didn't even blow out the candles. Let me know when you need me. You're fucked. Let's see what you have to say. You can do it, Meo. Happy birthday. It took me so long to pick this for you. Why did you give me this? You are smart, figure it out. I bet he didn't know. Wow, what a great present! You know me so well. Here, let me blow out the candles. Cheers. - Two, three, cheers. - Wait. Wait. - Where is Hoang? - Yeah. - Hoang? - That's right. Where is he? - Hoang. - Lift him up. - What's wrong? - Lift him up. - Is he okay? - Who smacked his neck? - I… did… - Put the beer down. When you set off the fireworks, I suddenly fainted. Get the coin. No need… It's not lucky doing that at a birthday party. You guys have fun. - Put this back, please. - Cheers. - Let's continue. - Cheers. One, two, three. Cheers. - Cheers. - Rock, paper, scissors. Cheers. Cheers, Vinh. Cheers. Thai. Going to pee. The restroom downstairs is occupied. - So I had to come up here. - I see. It took you a little too long. Long time, no drinks? Thai. Weren't you a policeman before? It was a very long time ago. I got old and retired early. You might not recognize me, but I recognize you. You danced at Gia Dinh park. Looking at your moves, I'm certain that you are a dancer like me. Exactly. How come you're selling broken rice now? I got hit by a cab and busted my knee. Lucky you, though. Quit one job and could start another one right away. You're luckier. Let me tell you my story. I was lost in my ways too. Luckily, I was in the same jail as those white-collar criminals. When I got out of jail, I got some money and invested it all in real estate. I was preparing to enjoy the get-rich-quick scheme but the pandemic hit. I'm in deep shit now. It's life, it has its ups and downs. If you are patient, God has a plan for you. That is what I like about you. I like the way you talk. I have some business… I'd like to discuss with you. I want to make your restaurant a chain. - A chain? - Right. Just give me a number. Don't think too much. I think we shouldn't… You're right, we shouldn't talk about business while drinking. I like you. Let's go down and continue drinking. Let's go. Hello. I'm up here with Mr. Thai. Go buy more food. It seems that Thai wants to invest in real estate. He's looking at our company's profile really carefully. Oh, shoot. Hoang. This is just a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? You were a cop, and I was a criminal. You should be careful. But this is… Freeze. Calm down. Freeze. Hold. You really are a professional. You look so cool holding a gun. Estás seguro. These lighters… - I was just kidding with you. - Hot, it's still hot. If you like it, I'll give it to you. These kids gave it to me. Go down and keep drinking. Don't just stay here and keep laughing like this. What? What "gun" are you groping for? You can't have my biological "gun." If you can't drink, don't do it. Tried to drink too much and now you can't hold it. You are the one who forced… I think Hoang is right. Hoang again. Did Hoang bewitch you? I'm on your side. You want to focus on talking or puking? - I can't stand seeing you like this. - Uncle. You still suspect Hoang? I have been following him for the last few days. I think Hoang is focusing only on his business now, and even creates jobs for these people. It's just that you don't want to give up, right? Even if you don't catch criminals, you still have the restaurant. - You can make a living this way. - Uncle Thai! - Shoot, you scared me. - What? The restaurant owner apologized to his client by breaking his client's neck. As you can see, this is surely not the end. If you want to know what drama comes next, please like, share and subscribe. - Well, that's all folks. - Here, let me. What are we going to do now? I think I need to consider Hoang's franchise offer. You bought this restaurant for $1,100. It has a reputation now, I can only sell it for double the price. Here you are. - Here. - Thanks. Homemade herbal drink. We accept your offer, but the franchise fee is… Tell me straight. We have… - Many customers. - I know. The fee will be around… How about this? I'll make an offer that we will both be happy with. $4,400 for each restaurant. I will pay $44,000 as a franchise fee for 10 restaurants. $44,000? If you agree, we will draft the contract. Kim will transfer $44,000 to your account. Deal? Estás seguro. CREDITED $4,400 Uncle, we don't know how to thank you. Thank you, Uncle Thai. Uncle. I've never had this much money in my account. Thank you. - No worries. - Please drink. You deserve it. You guys have money now, you don't need to stay here with me anymore, but remember, you always have to earn an honest penny. We will remember. Uncle, can I say something? Can I please stay with you? I don't want to leave. Okay. Just one sentence and he turns us into the bad guys. It's like you're saying that we took advantage of Uncle Thai. Yeah, like we're burning a book after reading it. Like we let a new one in, and kick the old one out. Hey, chicks stay together. Wow, unbelievable. Talking in idioms like rich people. We're high class now. Alright. Meo will stay here and help me. Phu, you will start your own business, won't you? Yeah. - What are you going to do, Thu and Vinh? - We will do what we're best at. Hello, everyone. Look at the red one. Only $17 and only one left. Here it is, pastel. Very pretty. It's $13. Please leave your phone number. Next, please. Okay, you two, please come in. The next four people, please. Wait, it's 20% off for the grand opening, right? Right. Grand Opening. 20% off. DEPARTMENT STORE ON A CART Hello, boss. - Thanks. - Good luck to you. - Okay, enough. - Thank you. Ship this for me. This pair of shoes is $240. - We'll take two. - Okay. Over there, Dad. - Coming right up. - Rice with ribs and eggs please. You can sit outside. Hey, the rib is burnt. Take it or fuck off. What kind of service is this? We're only selling 100 portions today, and only for people who are taller than 170cm. Are you taller than 170cm? Four people, let them in. Fuck off, I'll beat the shit out of you. What do you want? Meo, come here. Look. Take it or fuck off. Hey, you can't say that. We pay for the food. I don't know, Uncle. Oh God. Why are they closing so early? The restaurant is not doing well recently. Hoang said he wants to close the restaurant for a few days to train his staff again. Okay. Drive safely. Where are you driving? - Do you know how to use your brain? - I like doing it this way. Shit. Hey, girl. Hello, food delivery. Hey. Hey, girl. I don't know. - Stop. - I don't know. I'm telling you to stay still. Freeze. Give it to me. Help! Please help. Are you abusing her? We have a pervert here. You are misunderstanding. - Call the police. - No. Everyone. Beat him. Here. Why haven't you come home yet? Today is My's birthday, it's also… I know. Have you finished work? Want to go grab some drinks? Thai. You have to go home. A special occasion… Is only special, when you have your family beside you… Sit down and eat. Hey, I'm watching that. Let me explain. I thought that girl was suspicious, so I wanted to check up on her. Have some food. Is it that bad? It's delicious. Let me tell you what happened in my class. They said you were a pervert, but I didn't believe it, so they showed me this clip. I was wrong, really. Don't do this anymore. I can't stand it. You say you can't stand it? Do you think I can stand it? You spend your whole day trying to catch criminals. It has been the same for 17 years. You care about other people's business, but you don't care about this family. You bought a cake? Throw it away. MY BABY GIRL Hang in there. You know, before Mom had a stroke, she said she wanted to wait for you, so we could celebrate my birthday together. But ever since, my birthday is just a day to remember her. Have you ever thought of my happiness? Why did you buy a cake? Do you think I can eat it? I tried to persuade myself that you and I are both suffering. But no, you haven't changed at all. I have to admit that you are selfish. I won't be like Mom. I won't stay here and wait for you. My! My! In just one night, I lost your mom, my career, everything. Don't you see that I'm also hurt? But there are some things. I can never let go of. Then for how long will you live like this? You take everything for yourself. They don't need you as much as you think. Take care of everything you want, and then come back here to take care of this family in Mom's place. What is this mess? My employees went to the new territory, and were attacked by people in that neighborhood. Every house has its own master. It's normal, man. What happened? I invested in cryptocurrency. They said I could earn up to 10%. I invested all my money, and the platform crashed this morning. I lost everything. Shit, money disappeared even faster than when I was gambling. - You lost it all? - Yeah, not a single penny left. Please drop me here, sir. Got you. What happened? I imported some stuff, but customs said there were no legal documents. They took them all. Alright, I still have some carts here. No need to put much money in. We share the profit evenly, and start again. Okay? Okay? - Brothers… - Brothers. Phu. You are too good to be true. If I hadn't listened to you guys trying to be white-collar, if I had stayed with Meo in the restaurant, I would have had not only money, but also love. You were the first one to mention that to us. You were the first with the move. Yes, it was me. But you two followed. Now I'm hungry, but I feel embarrassed to go over to the restaurant. Just go over and look for Thai. He will make you something to eat for sure. I can't see Uncle Thai, not after this failure. No, he is the one who can't see us. What? This clip has been viral since this afternoon. CLOSED In the end, I'm also a loser. I can't even manage my personal life, not to mention social matters. Maybe it's because other restaurants didn't do it right. I think My was just too mad. You know she loves you so much. Thanks, kids. In troubled times like these, only you guys listen to me. Uncle, can you be less cheesy right now? I get goosebumps easily. Uncle. We can't leave you now. Can we go back to the restaurant? Okay, let me tell Meo to redecorate and we can start again. Thank you. Can I go inside and grill the beef? - Have some drinks too. - Okay. Let's do this. - Come in. - But I don't have a key. Meo keeps the key. But I can't call him. - Or did the guy find a new girl already? - Shut up. Bullshit. Let me call him. What happened? Singles like you won't understand this. Hey… why is he going there? See. Maybe he went there to discuss the other restaurant chains with Hoang. Meo has never… contacted them directly. I think… there is something wrong here. KHANH HOANG REAL ESTATE COMPANY REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE BUSINESS - Speak. - Go on in. You hid in jail for a while. Now you're out, you tried to get all the stuff for yourself? Spit it out for me. You don't know? Speak. Speak. Speak. If the police had come, you and I would have been in deep shit. For the last time, where did you hide it? His teeth look awful. Let me help him fix them. Where is it? The harbor. The harbor. I'll tell you. It's in the harbor. You should have said earlier. Run! Run! - Thu. - Phu, keep her. Uncle Thai. Jump. Phu, it hurts. Are you okay? Where are you running to? Uncle Thai. Well… So crowded! Surprise! Meo is my man. You just ran the red light. Your driver's license, please. You have no way out. I'll call the police on whoever dares to vandalize my restaurant. Smart guys make smart choices. Sooner or later this would have been revealed. You guys can't get away from this. Uncle Thai… Thanks to you, our job went smoothly. Thank you, Thai the Crippled. It's always been the same. You are too hasty. How is your leg nowadays? Uncle Thai… Uncle Thai! Uncle Thai! Why are you doing this, Meo? Uncle Thai! Stop! Today is a good day for doing business. Let's go to the harbor. - Uncle Thai. - You stay put. Come here. Make it quick for old times' sake. Okay. Stand up. Who beat me the most the other day? - Me. - Me. Brave! - I'll shoot you first, shit-face. - Shoot me. Let them go. No, one for all and all for one. Vinh. Vinh… I didn't shoot yet. I didn't shoot yet. I'm shooting now. - Vinh! - Vinh! Prop bullets! My eyes are still good. Smart people make smart choices. Have you been following this case for long? Thu, turn on Meo's GPS. Hey, where are you looking? Sir. Meo reported that they are on the hook. - Get everyone ready. - Yes, sir. Good stuff, sir. I let this fatty go for a swim. Sir. Uncle Thai didn't know Meo's duty. I'm afraid… It is dangerous. I hope they won't be too hard on the criminals. What does that mean? - Cop? - Run! Police here. You are surrounded. Don't move. - Shit. - I said you can't escape. You too. If you want me to go easy on you, then cooperate with us. Asshole. Being two-faced? Go. You don't know yet. The Triple that are following Thai are all monsters. Because Vinh's family was too poor, he couldn't follow his dream career. He is a Vovinam prodigy. He won the City Championship twice. Thu used to be a gymnast. She joined the SEA Games. If she hadn't been injured, she could have won two or three gold medals already. It's extremely hard to catch Thu. Phu was on the National Soccer Team, but he was barred forever, because he got caught match-fixing. Sad waste of a young talent. And Thai is the monster of monsters. His achievements can be made into a 1,000-episode series. And do you know what his super power is? What is that? "Immortality." Run, sir. It hurts. Bitch. - Thu, watch out for the knife. - I got it. Thu. You could've let me know earlier, Meo. You can get to him only over my dead body. - Wow, such a cutie. - Watch out for the knife… Alrighty. On her foot. She has such long legs. Hey, girl. Pick on someone your own size. Watch out for the knife on her foot. Okay. There's on in her hand too. - Okay. Help. - Let me. Vinh, it hurts. My muscles are torn. Don't pass out. It hurts. You bitches dare to fight me. I'll kill you all. Vinh. "Grill" her ribs! - "Charge" her hard, Phu! - Go to hell. Tablecloth special move! Run. I can keep him back. Let's go. Go. She has too many knives. - Scumbags. - I can't handle her. I'm killing you all today. - What is the plan? - Where is Meo? Dare to mess with our restaurant? You're in big trouble. Hoang, you are under arrest. For drug possession and smuggling. You are no longer a cop. Stay true to yourself. Do you want to catch me because I'm a criminal or do you only want revenge? - Both. - So we are no different. I'm different now. I was wrong and now I want to fix it. I see you are preaching now. Preaching? Stand up. Stand up and start preaching again. Stand up. Can't stand anymore? Estás seguro. You think you can get away with it? Stay there. I will look for you. I'm coming for you. Where is Thai? Sir. Is the ambulance coming? We meet again. It's time for you to deliver the food to the River God. You're so clingy. One leg crippled and the other broken, and you can still make it? Still smiling? It is just a lighter. I know, that's why I took it. To light some incense for your grave? For your grave. My! - Dad, stay with me. - My! I did it. I saw it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't be selfish anymore. Today is my birthday, you haven't heard my wish, right? I wish that you will always be healthy, and be by my side on my graduation day, on my wedding day. Promise me. I promise. I promise. - Hurry up. - Please stay out here. PULL TO OPEN My Dear Daughter, I'm sorry… That I have always been absent in your special moments. Sorry that I may be absent on other occasions too. But I'm sure that should you have any problems, Phu, Vinh, Meo and Thu will be by your side and help you with all their hearts. Just like I used to help them. My! Hey, turn it off. You've been listening to it again and again. I like it. I didn't think you were that cheesy. Are you sad that you couldn't make it to the Tribute Ceremony today? Not at all, accompanying my daughter is the most important thing. What did you bring me here for? I will let you know. What is my wish? What is it? This is it. I want to cooperate with you to open a Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs restaurant. Okay. I'm happy to cooperate with you. - Uncle. - Hello. We are in trouble. - If you don't help us, we'll all die. - Emergency. Why are you guys crying at your Tribute Ceremony? The money that we got from Hoang was illegal money, do we have to give it back? Right, you have to give it back. - But we spent it all. - We don't have a penny left. It's okay. You can still make money. How are we in more debt after helping catch the criminals? - Okay, I'm hanging up now. - Uncle. Uncle! Hello, everyone. Meo. My wife. Hello, everyone. - Hello. - Hello. What would Meo like to have? What does Meo's wife want to eat? Thu can make it. You have egg on your face. Look at that. What's wrong with you? - It's okay. Just go in. - Let her be. She's always like that. We're used to it. When one door closes, another one will open. Don't worry. Phu is here. I will spend the rest of my life taking care of you. When one door closes, another one will open. - Vinh is here. - Screw you. I will spend the rest of my life taking care of you. Don't worry. It hurts, Phu. I don't care about you guys anymore. It hurts. You forgot I can do martial arts? - Thu. - Screw you. Don't bother me anymore. We have customers coming. Bui Tre's Broken rice with Pho-flavored beef ribs welcomes you.
