It's not right... I should have castrated it last summer I would have rode it May be we'll chase him to the village, then call people? Tell me, where do you thing the village is? That way It's that way, you fool I see, you would lose the way, it you were alone You don't know where you came from... I'm rarely going into forrest Your generation rarely walks to the forrest When we were young we've spent all the time there Once, long ago, during hay harvest we also lost a horse, we searched far a long time There were three of us. Two others were older than me We split up, each on his own road During the search I meet our horse But it began to run away from me I was following it He went into thicket, I'm after him, calling him I tried to catch it near the lake and went into swamp up to knees I was sucked deeper and deeper. I was afraid I started screaming, crying And nobody was around It was becoming darker and colder I began stoping feeling my legs because of cold And a horse was going around and eating When it was already dark the horse came to me I grabbed its mane then and pulled myself out that way I lost my boots in that swamp We came back to the village in midnight I've frostbitten my legs then, I spent a lot of time in hospital after that That horse should have been smart, then? Of cause, not like the one we are dealing with now, running away It's cooked already, eat it Where is our village? That way Have you remember what we got through? Hmm... a forrest, a lake and some barns Now I want you to go back that way Light up the stove, warm the kettle Why? I am going to stay with you You're chipmunk, aren't you? Chipmunks never go far from their home Go home then, warm the kettle I'm staying here Go home I'll search some more and will be back soon Go Do you want some water? How are you feeling? All right The headman gave me a job of a cleaning lady at the administration That's good How is the boy? He is all right, he's became a man, don't smoke, it seems He need attention. Once you lose oversight on him, hi might lose his ways What's about your legs? I didn't frostbitten them, it seems Take your son back, he needs a mother He has learned tinkering a little I'll take a shirt, I am going to complete sewing it at home I did't manage to find a young horse I's my grandfather's knife I's made of a good steel Take it or don't take it, it's up to you Hello Hi How are you? Nothing new, what's about you? I'm ok, my mother have altered a shirt for you By the way, here is somebody came to you I've invited her to the house, are you ok with that? I'm ok, but who is it? Come in, see for yourself Good buy You've waited for a long time, haven't you? For two years No, I mean, how long are you sitting here? Ah... For about an hour What's that? So, like that... A shirt Let's take a look Look Did you sewed it yourself? Yes, I did Looks great Well, here's new skirt, here is my house I'm tinkering boxes near the stove all day long I have three horses And one more young horse Which I can't find It has been eaten up, it seems Are you going to be my wife? And what do you think? Let's go then Let's go Are you tired? No, I am not You've still done not presented a wooden box to me I am looking for a good material As I will find it, I'll make up a box for you right away Do you do everything all by yourself? Yes, I do I have a daughter and two grandchildren They have promised me to come at the new year holiday, I'll present them to you How will we live? We will support each other Have you been seeing me, a fool one, through the window? Why are you fool? I've been seeing you Probably, people are laughing at us, that we've got married at old age No, they aren't On the contrary, they are jealous of you, that you've found such a woman for a wife Well, let's go to sleep You're go get some smoke, and I'll prepare the bed Ignat used to sit near the stove all the time He used to tinkering boxes all the time This house was build during the 60's, it seems Ignat was a good man We used to arguing with him about life, about global problems all the time... He was good educated, smart There is nothing to return as it was now There is nothing to return as it was
