What do you want? Wait! Can I speak with you for a moment? Igor, I’ll be waiting in the car. Misha! Misha! You little monkeys! I won't let you get down until you've swept all the snow off. I want you to sign a contract with me. Is that all? Isn’t that enough? What if I were to punch you in the face? Please! Wait! To go to Minnesota with a proposal of an NHL Draft. Go away! We’ll discuss all the details and sign the papers. OK? Hey, what are you doing? Take a look! – Don’t you know who I am? – Who are you? Who? Gataulin. So what? You know what? You’re in luck. Hello? You gotta be kidding! The same one! Of course that's who, you clown. Hey, where are you? I’ve been waiting ages. Come to the entrance of the Sports Palace. Hurry up. So, it's true, then? And why me in particular? No reason. I have a good eye. I see you're starting to see reason. So… I see you understand me. Only me? On my own? Schhh… quiet. You shouldn't be seen with me. I’ll contact you. Is it definite? You're not on the plane yet, soldier. Just with your brother in the Japanese car. Hey, get out. Who was that guy? A fan. I couldn't get rid of him. You've become a star, Nightcap. I wanted to punch him. Why? Aren't you playing for these people? Such a clown! Is your nose broken? Looks like it. So what? So nothing. It was for you. That’s what I mean. It's not your fault. We got the same blood in our veins, Nightcap. I'm sick of being called Nightcap! But what else should I call you? What else? Nightcap suits you so well. Who? What are you doing? Drive the car! Hey, stop it! – Hey, Misha, who's driving? – Nightcap suits you so well. An ambush! They’ve seen the car. This is the end! [We love Budnik] So, which of us is the star? We're both famous in this county. Kill 'em. Bitches! You shouldn't say that. What? What you just said. What did I say? They mustn’t be killed. They need to be loved. But they're alive! They jumped aside like grasshoppers. You say that because you've never been laid, virgin. Once you get a taste… you'll be saying… Hey, that's some sweet tasting dessert, man. What about you? You drove straight at them! The brakes. What’s wrong with the brakes? The brake pedal didn't respond. So the brakes aren't working? Are you crazy? Cap, what’s wrong with you today? What? You’re strange. You're not normal. Hey, what are you doing? I lost control, Cap. If somebody wants to hurt you it isn’t me anymore. Are you angry with me? No. Just get down. Is your baby carrot ready? I’m worried. Do you even know where to shove it? Don’t worry. For god's sake shove it somewhere. You are too fussy. Something's wrong today. You're not yourself and I'm not myself. Damn nose. Damn it! This car is rubbish! Get up. "Pharaoh" – So was he really a fan? – Who? Who do you mean? Nobody. All right, bye, bruv. Bye! Misha, Misha! He wasn’t a fan. It was Gataulin, in person. He talked about Minnesota and the Draft. Misha! He promised me a contract. Hey, Nightcap. Nightcap, what's the matter? Your ears are so cold. You are so foolish! Nightcap! Is it true? That's incredible! It’s not finalised. He's thinking it over. Where is he now? He's coming to watch the training session tomorrow. – It's confirmed. – So what? We have to do our best. That's all! You will, Cap, don’t worry. Everything will be all right. Hey, cover yourself up. Get dressed. What’s the matter? It's only Nightcap. Hey, the food's on the table. – Misha! – That’s me! Are you mad that I didn’t tell you straight away? That I lied to you? You lost your head. It happens. It's OK. I’m a son of a bitch. You wouldn’t lose your head. And what about the curve? They might not like our coach's sticks. I can’t catch the puck with a straight one. What are you talking about? What Kukin from Columbus said. Which “Columbus”? Knock on wood! Cap… It’s our chance, Cap, isn’t it? The American National Hockey League. It’s a chance to test ourselves. To try out personal strength. As an individual… Right? What can I do? Let’s have a drink. Cheers, Lucy! Yuk. That stuff's shit. We got to get serious now. Stop this nonsense. You gotta do your best in the training session tomorrow. Got it? As for me I never miss a training session. You don’t. It’s me who does. But no more! Now I’ll start living. There was no need to do that! No need to do what? No need to pour the vodka out. And do you know who you are? And who you're talking to? Misha! Stop it! And his famous brother Igor Budnik. You idiots! Misha! Misha! I won’t go without you. We're together, aren’t we? Yes, we are. We are a team. Right. In the game and in life. And he knows that as well as us. Don’t doubt it. We are worthless apart. But together… We are strong. Go home to bed. Ten o’clock, tomorrow. Have you seen my brother? No! Anyone seen Misha? – Have you seen my bruv? – No! Hey, have you seen Misha? – Have you seen Misha? – No! Hey, have you seen Misha? You've seen Misha, haven’t you? Have you seen my bruv? What is this? I don't get it. Ice-dancing? Just wait. He will come! – Who? – My brother. What has your brother got to do with it? I still don't get it. Igor! How come you're all dressed up today? Do you want to have dinner? Thanks, Nadya, dear! – Your cheesecakes are delicious. – You're welcome! I already told you to be quiet! The issue is under discussion. Don’t follow me. Tea, Igor? No! But you have seen both of us playing. You again? My bruv and I are a team. We work only together. – No! – Why? You are not. Quite the contrary. But he is stronger than me! – I know. – And so…? But we need you. Why? What is the reason? There's no reason. Just you! You forgot these. Oh, thanks! Why are you limping? I hurt my leg. You’ll never come out alive if you follow me. And this is not necessary. We need you in good shape. Have some of this. Look who's here! Hey, careful! Sveta, help! He'll kill me! Just you try! Sorry, Cap. Go on, knife me. Well, it just happened. What happened? Sveta has a day off. That's more important than the selections guy? Maybe. Are you being a prick again? It’s my life. Igor, sweetie why are you so angry? Hey, stop touching each other! - What? - Stop squeezing! My carrot's ready. Idiot! Hey, what are you doing? Where are you dragging him off to? Where are you taking me? Misha, where are you going? To the USA! You owe me one hundred roubles. Uncle Kolya! He'll come again. Don’t worry. For all that money. What money? The money that guy will earn thanks to us. Why are you worried about his money? I don't get it. But you said… – What did I say? – That you will start living. I am living! – And that’s it? – Yes. A life of being torn between Lucy and Sveta? But I love them, Cap. Both of them? Yes! I am in love with them. More and more. Maybe I'm crazy. I’m losing it, eh? The USA! The USA… It could be a solution. Cap. What if I just sneak away? That would be a solution! Let him pick you first. You mean he’ll pick you? Looks like it. It’s ridiculous! How can he pick you without me? Nonsense. I'm just supposing. Me too. But if he only picks one of us who will he pick? Hey, Nightcap! You are worthless without me, aren’t you? You only scored those three goals thanks to me. You've always been such a foolish clown and now you think you're a genius? You haven't been knocked out yet because I look out for you. And you… What are you? You know, don’t you? You're simply Nightcap. I can see all my women in your eyes. Something is wrong with him. Your brother, I mean. How's that? How to say… I don’t know, you see. He seems to be perfect but he is not. And me? You are. Your papers will be delivered in a few days. Our decision is no. That’s our decision. So, have you decided? Yes, we have. We are not going without the brother. Listen, you. My time is valuable. I'm a serious man. I don't extrapolate much. But if I do business with you I don’t want to hear crap like this. I'm a powerful man. Do you think yours is the only team with any players worth selecting? I'm responsible for this whole county. I have real business. I know the results of the coming match. And all you can talk about your damn brother… Who we don't need. What do you want me to do? Watch him play and pick him too. Can we leave? Of course! See you, girls. I’ll call you. It's a chance in a billion. Don’t you realise how many teams are like your little Diesel team? And no one ever scores a winner! You are just lucky. Yes! What does that mean? I am lucky. Are you going to talk about your brother again? I already have. Then follow the girls. Get out! Leave. Fast. Why did you leave? Because I knew you'd run after me. Is that a power technique? Technique is worthless without power. Now I see that you’ve been paid a lot of money for me. Have you, now? Smart boy. Yes, that’s me. When are you playing? Tomorrow against Penza. OK, I'll come with someone who'll probably come in on this. If we need money for two players now. Please, try to! Try and we’ll try to do our best. – We are brothers, you know. – OK. In the USA we will be called "the Budnik Brothers". You’ll be satisfied. Enough! You better go. You shouldn’t take up your brother’s case. I just wanted to help him. You shouldn’t help him. Why, we all need help? No, to each their own. King of power. Let’s go to a restaurant together right now. I'm not in a very good mood today. We can invite Ira and Alla too. How's that? Sporting schedule. I’m Inna! "Café" So, this is what you’re like. What a surprise. You look revolting in your headgear. Look, there's a picture of you. What’s wrong? My shoelace. You and your brother nearly ran me over in the car. That was me. Me. I'd better untie it in the USA. "Diesel" Don’t look back! We’ll get through this! Look! Hey! Мinnesota! Move! Go! Who are you talking to? Just to fans. Budnik! You bastard! What the hell are you doing? Sledgehammer Shulz! Didn’t you understand? I tried to imitate him. For the selections guys. There's a guy like that in all the foreign teams. The one who beats everyone up. And they don’t mind. He's just doing his job. He beats up his rivals to demoralize them. Then the technical experts like you score the goals. That referee is a bastard. Isn’t he? He sent me off. I could kill him. We're not a street gang. Everything will be all right. We’ll win through, Cap. Say something. Sorry about it… I just tried to imitate Shulz, but I got out of control. Get into the car! The brakes’ve been repaired. It’s OK. Damn you! Stop manipulating me. It was you who started it. And now you're angry with me. I need some relaxation now. I’m going to see Sveta. That’s the end, they won’t pick us. I did my best. I took up his case. I tried really hard. The end. Good bye, Minnesota. Do you hear me? And you are not going. You will stay in this kitchen for the rest of your life. As you deserve. What a lost chance. You poor loser. What can I do about it? What does it have to do with me? The wife is the closest person. But you! Only one thing worries you! What's that? The carrot. That's his fate. Not mine! What am I supposed to do? He is an asshole, what can I do? Is that my brother you just called an asshole? Yes, of course. Don’t you dare! He is better than me. He is perfect. He is the best guy around. – Don't you know that, you fool? – Yes, I know. And I know where he is now. And who he is with. What do you mean? Without him I wouldn’t exist now. We've been together since childhood. He used to babysit me. He is who I am. Nightcap. I don’t care for you. But I'd kill anyone for him. Even you. Do you hear? Do you hear? You are beautiful. A heart is beating. Come on! Go! Misha! I’ve slept with Lucy. Seems like I’m a real man now. I’m not a virgin anymore. And it happened with Lucy. Yes, you’re a real man. Misha, I haven’t been with a woman before but now it means… So you did it with Lucy? Yes, I did. Now I know what a man does with a woman. Forgive me… Go on! Go! So you decided to complain to the brother? What the hell are you talking about, Nightcap! I guess you've slept with Sveta too? Or not yet? – No. – Thanks! I won’t do it again. Didn't you like it? I’m sorry, Misha. You can go on living. And don’t cry, please. When mum took you to nursery school the first day you'd wet yourself. You’ve always been like that. A crybaby! Come here, sit down. I didn’t hear what you told me. Is he still here or already gone? Who? Your selection guy. We're playing the Chemists tomorrow. Will he watch me or not? Calm down. Of course he will. Don’t even doubt. Of course he will. I'm going to see him right now. I’ll put pressure on him. – Go! – We’ll win through. I’m sure. The game has started. Do you think we'll beat them today? Their goalkeeper is very smart. He has a strong stance. Just kick the puck. That’s what we need to do. No, not kick it. We need to entice him out that cunning little fox. How? We need a clever tactic. They look so small, don’t they? What happened? A load of roaches escaped from the zoo? Look how he holds his stick. Just like it’s his dick. Aren't you in the wrong place? Did you pay for your tickets? Clowns. They are not clowns, they are chemists. Chemists… alchemists. Chemists! Chemists! Are you going to beat these children up? No. I'll be nice. No shows of strength. I’m not a sledgehammer any more. What do you think about North American schooling? You'll be first in the league. Is he coming for sure? Damn it, this is the start of everything! I’m so nervous. I promised. Are you gonna play your trump card? Yes. OK, tomorrow we’ll hammer those dogs. What? No? But what if there’s no other way? Why not? Over there. Where? That way. "Way out" Oh, no! That's not for me. Minnesota! Minnesota! It's OK, I got it. Come on! Are you all right? Misha, Misha. Misha Budnik! I'm in a hurry right now. I’ve got a match. Guys, the drinks are on me. – What? – The drinks are on me. – I'm in a hurry! – Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I rescued a tramp from a hole in the ice. Sorry? From a hole in the ice. Did they give you a medal? No! I'm sure you will. And then we'll celebrate. Igor! Igor! Can I speak to you alone, please? What for? I want to explain why I was late. The reason. – You’ve already explained. – Not the whole thing. OK. Shoot. I was wondering. But not in front of those guys. We have no secrets. You were late. The selections guy has gone. That’s it. Guys, we wanted to go to the USA. But that was before. Hold your horses. Again? Yes, damn it. Please choose one reason. But there are two. Incredible. So is our life… incredible. Your life. Whatever did you fight like that for? You should be ashamed. Mum, don't say that. Don’t worry. Please, mum. Mum! Look, mum, we just had an argument. – Now let's drink your health, mum. – Mum! Mum… Mum, come on. As long as you have your health nothing else matters. You’ve got everything you need. What have I got? You've got us. Isn’t that enough? Why is he sleeping? He's tired, that’s why. Why is he tired? Because of his other family? Did you come round for a sleep, dad? This is his way of congratulating me. What about? What a shame. We'll take him for a rest, mum. Come on, dad. Leave him alone. Hey! What are doing? How much have you drunk? A liter? How can you spoil such a good day! Hey, you two hulks. I'm your father. I made you, you two giants. Off you go. You need some fresh air. I made you and this is how you treat me. And you… Dad! What do you want? What do you want? You're crying! Shall we see you home? We'll see you home, dad. Let’s go! Let’s! Come on, boys. Come on! Let’s go! Let's go! No. No. You can't. What do you mean? We can, right, Nightcap? Yeah, we can. Dad! – Dad! – Dad! Misha! Misha! Look! It's him all right. Hey! Wait! Wait! We won’t beat you up! Stop, you idiot. We're not gonna hurt you. We don’t need your Minnesota. We're fine here. We’re better off here, man! Stop it! What are you doing, guys? Hey, sorry, man. We thought you were someone else. We made a mistake! – Do you want a drink? – No! Thanks! You're so lucky that your first woman was my Lucy. Why? Well, she's your kin. She's not a stranger. Is she? Hey, Igor! Igor! Hurry up! Supper's ready. Supper's ready. "Privet Vodka" You've grown up. You need a bigger kennel. You have good eyes, Igor. We don't. What eyes? What are you talking about, dad? Not our eyes. Foreign eyes. Dad! Let’s have supper. Wash your hands. You've been touching the dog. Winter, worries… and tall weeds. A shot… rings out. A crow circles in the sky. It's very good! Yes! Close the door! Guys! Hey, man! Back again, mate? – Yes! – Attaboy! Well done. Guys! What about my watch? Which watch? You lost your watch? He lost it because of us, right? No problem. Here you are. Take care! Oh, dusty, misty roads… Winter, worries… And tall weeds… How much have you drunk, you bastard? The door is open. What? What? Wow! You're a strong boy! Great muscles! Well we have muscles, too. You already robbed your brother once, Cap. What do you mean? This. Yes, I did! You have such grabbing hands. – Why? – Haven’t you? Actually, yes, I have! Actually, put your arms around me. Actually I… I just wanted to help. I’m trying my best and only shit happens… What happens? This. Don’t you like it? Yes, I do! Stop worrying. You have already gone. End of story. What do you mean? I mean… That's just how it's happened. You are going to live in a mansion with a swimming-pool and servants. You are a star of world fame, Cap. You will be. You already are. You'll be the guy who'll win the Stanley Cup. And my brother? What about my brother? You know the answer. He's a fool! How did this happen? Why? Because that is how your brother is. And I've said yes to the selections guy. Alone. To get your revenge? Why? What do you mean? Because you're robbing your brother. What the hell are you talking about? When it happened with me and Lucy, I nearly went crazy. I nearly lost it. Honest. But you didn’t. And who are you, there in that mansion? Me? I’m your dog, Cap… Take me there! Take me with you…. Hey, man, give me my money back! You are taking a big risk here. I am Michael Budnik. The Sledgehammer! You bastard! Don’t kick it! There's no money in it. Where is it? I’ve shoved a lot into its hole. You shoved it in another one, in the middle. You need to remember where you shove things in. You know how we deal with pranks like that in Minnesota? We're all sick to death of your Minnesota. – Would you like some whiskey? – Yes. Whiskey all round. I'll pay. Doubles for everyone. Cap! What’s going on? You're not getting Sveta! Stop! Wait! "Café Ship" Stop! Stop! Freeze, you bastard! Get down! Get down! Get down! What the hell are you doing? Shut up, moron or we'll cut off your legs. We are the Budnik brothers. The who brothers? Budnik that's who. We are. Everybody knows us! Except us! Your school mates who you've forgotten! Hi, guys. Let’s identify you. Misha! You seem in low spirits today, man. Where've you been all this time? You weren't there for National Unity Day. The snow came, but again you weren't there. Misha, this is not how real friends behave! Mikheeva has had a baby. The father's an Arab like Ben Laden. She returned home so proudly. We were celebrating… with only three women and ourselves! Pasha's father, the ex-chief of the transport department is building a house. And Pasha has got his flat. Again, we celebrated that without you. Where have you been? As for me, my wife and I are divorced. We've been boozing without you. Why? Hey, what's going on? Why have you cut yourselves off? Igor! Igor! Look, what's the game? – Problems? – Misha! We used to be friends until you became hockey-stars! Platoon! We work all day long. And friendship is equal to work. What about you? Come on, guys! Get on the bus! Misha! We’ll go to my summer cottage for vodka and appetizers. I’ll invite the neighbours, Misha. Misha, what’s up? Are you ill? Have I offended you? He was about to beat up his own brother. Crazy guy. We should probably arrest them again. I’ll wait for you here tomorrow. In the morning, at nine. Don’t ask any questions. Just come without fail. Right? Right? You got a hole in your knee. Shame on you. It doesn't count. – What? – What I said to you. You've said a lot. I'm getting confused. That I agree to go alone. – Don’t you agree? – No! Look who's here. Is he pushing for his rights again? Hi, Igor, my friend! Here… Your coach is already here. He wants to watch his player arguing. – Shall I do it again? – Yes! He said: Let me see this ice-hockey wonder. So what have you decided? Look in the clause marked "Specific Conditions". About your brother, you mean? Yes, what have you decided? He is going too. How come? What, are you disappointed? You didn’t fill this in. You are going to Penza on Thursday on the first flight. All you have to do is pack your suitcases. When will we sign the papers? On the site. But why am I going to Penza? Where do you want to go? To Minnesota. Where? Well… As a future proposal, why not? As a future proposal… This is impossible. From Penza to Minnesota? And from this god-forsaken hole is it possible? From Penza to Voskresensk. For two years or so. And then to Moscow. We can’t send you straight there. You'd be in Voskresensk for about a year. No, you're wrong, Palych. OK, one year or two or maybe three. Who knows? Cheers! Here's to your career. Budnik, don’t listen to him. – Don't pay any attention. – OK You’ll break through, I’m sure. So am I. Did you really think you'd go straight there? – Is it up to your brother? – Yes! He isn’t so young. He won’t be able to. So you've got an elder brother. One of my brothers is a clown and the other is a criminal. What can I do? Hello? Yes! Yes, I’m at the hotel. Where are you? Get over here. We're done. Bye. Yes. Fast! – What? Cap? – What's the matter? Hey, where's your coat? Have you lost it? I don't know. You look great. And what about you? You haven't been home? No! Where have you been? Here, of course. Wait, I… You did say I should wait here. So I waited. Why not? So I'm not late, right? All night long? Come on, let's go. Misha, what’s wrong with you? Huh! What’s going on, Misha? Have you gone crazy? Stop it, please. I am just being obedient, Nightcap. I'll follow you from now. Always. Anywhere. I'll be like you. And everything will be all right, won’t it? Let’s go! Let’s go! No. You're acting strange. Something’s wrong. What? I don’t know what. You didn't tell me the whole truth. Nightcap. You stole my first woman and my second woman. Don’t steal the third. It will break me. Really. I’m done. Who's the third one? Minnesota… Minnesota is a woman too. Isn’t she? That’s it. I… Nice coat. You're lying by the swimming pool. And he's offering you… Who's offering? – Your servant. – Black servant. What is he offering? A Martini. You got that wrong. I can’t stomach it. I prefer vodka. Then pour the Martini over him. You can! I don’t like Negroes. That’s why I'm not going! Then I'll visit you accompanied by Interpol. I can't live without you, Lucy. Don't worry. Just go! Or you’ll be late and you'll miss your flight. It’s OK, I'm driving. The luggage is in the boot. Nightcap is at the airport. It’s OK. Hey, what’s up? And a helicopter is landing in our garden. And the President is getting out of it? No, he isn’t. He's busy on his war tactics. – Not him. – Then who? Your father. He has come and brought us some smoked cheese. From our milk plant? He was on a special flight and was nearly shot down. – You're lying. – Why Don't you know? I don't have a father. Of course you're right. It’s your mother. Your mother is on board. When she gets out she's really surprised. Lucy! How come you have so many lovely vases and jars? There are Stanley Cups everywhere. And I’m coming to meet her and giving her a hug. Misha, I love you. And I always will. I’ve always loved you too… And what about Cap? That was something else. I don’t know what. So you will come? We'll be happy. Do you trust me? And Michael Jackson will get out of the helicopter. Not that bastard. And I'll say to him, "Hello, my namesake". What kind of Minnesota is that? I don’t want vodka. That’s what we have here. And what would you like? Martini! Sweetheart! Two Martinis. You've become so fussy in the USA. A Boeing is landing. Both of our dads are on board. They are both in a good mood. And drunk. I don't have a dad. Why are you women all like this? None of you has a father… What’s up? There's a beach in front our house in Minnesota. It’s in the North. I’ve seen it on the map. So what? Michael Jackson lives there. You are lying. He doesn’t live there. He does. That’s why he has such white skin. So you're getting out with Michael Jackson… Why, am I a kid? He likes children! He's getting out with our children. He's their best friend. But we still don't have any children. We will have. Do you trust me? Well… You'd better check the time or you’ll be late. We're lying on the beach. You and me. The ocean is crashing. You're wearing blue shorts. Everyone wants to photograph you. Why? That’s what I ask them. "Why are you taking pictures of her?" "I’m the Champion". But they say: "Sorry… but she's such a beautiful lady". "Your wife". But I’m not you wife! I’m not! Then we'll get married. At the Ice Palace in Minnesota. That’s why I brought you with me. Svetlana Budnik. What did you say about blue shorts? Don’t you like what I said? – I won’t go. – Why? Because of my ass. I'm only showing it in the bathroom, in the dark. But they have cameras with flashes. My poor Crooked-Nose. That’s who you are. Your nose has become so crooked. Because of that day with Nightcap. Crooked-Nose! Why are you leaving me? Why are you leaving? Crooked-Nose!
