You have two options. One, you stay in, you stay with us. Or two. Well. You know what the Horsemen do to people. Day to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Ana. Happy birthday to you. - Sweetheart, not yet. You gotta make a wish first. - Oh my goodness! - Yeah! - Dad, this is the keyboard I wanted! Thank Daddy. - Thank you. You're welcome, darling. Happy birthday to you! All right, sweetie, let's jump in bed. Time for bed. - But I don't want to yet. - You think that decision's up for you? Get in those covers. In there. So did you have a happy birthday with all your friends over today? I loved all my presents. Thank you, Daddy. - You're welcome, sweetheart. All right, hop in there, I'll tuck you in. Tuck you in all tight. - Don't forget the feet! - I won't forget the feet, arggh! I love you, sweetheart, good night. Good night, Dad. Daddy? - Yes, sweetie. - Are you gonna come to church tomorrow? For you, sure thing. - You promise? - Yeah, I promise. - Love you, Dad. - Love you too, baby girl. What a day. Oh no, I did it again. - What? - I left the garage door open. - You would, not it! - Oh, I'll be right back. What? Oh my God, what happened? Are you all right? - Come on. All right, sit down here. - Keep an eye on her, hang tight. I'll call an ambulance. - Where's my baby? Who took her? Corinna, where are you? - You guys sit tight-- What is it, oh my God. What is that? What is going on? What? - You guys hang tight, I'll be right back. - What? - Hang tight. - Honey, when, where? - It's all right, it's okay. Where? - Listen, baby, it's okay. It's okay, we'll figure this out. We'll figure this out. - Corinna, give it. Oh look, there's an accident. Let me just... I'll be right over here. Paul! - Peter. - Oh my gosh. Peter, can you give me a hand? - Oh sure. - Come on, we gotta get them up. - You all right? You look terrible. - Oh my God. What is that sound? That sounds way too low. Oh my God. - Oh my God! That thing is coming down. - That thing is coming down. Those people. - Oh my gosh. - Rose. Ana. Rose, Rose! Ana! Rose, did you? Rose! Rose, are you with Ana? Rose, Ana! Ana, no! Ana, no! What is going on? What is going on? Oh my God, no! Oh my God. Get back, get back! Who are you? - It's okay. We're just passing through. - It's okay, we're just. - Get back! - We're nobody. - Give me your bag, give me your bag. Throw it over, throw it over. You too, bag now, do it! Back, stay back. - Take whatever you want. We'll be on our way. Dude. - Stay back. - Take whatever you need. Just take whatever you want that you need. Just calm down. Take whatever you need, and we'll be outta here. - Look, we're just passing through. - Chill out! - Calm down. - We're just passing through. - Get back, I'll shoot. I promise you! - Dude, don't need to go there. Who are you, got any food? - Just take whatever you want. - Who are you, who are you? We're nobody. We're passing through. - You got any medical supplies? - Dude, are you all right? - Are you okay? Grab your bag. - His leg, his leg. - Sit down, relax, relax. We got this. What's your name? We got this. - Dude, that does not look good at all. - It's okay, we got this. - How long you been out here, man? - I don't know. Like not long. Oh! - Just breathe, it's okay, relax. - I don't know, not long. A week, 10 days. I got some medicine I'll put on it. You'll be all right. We'll get you taken care of. - Dude, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be all right. - Now, don't take this off until I say so. - She's a feisty one. - That's Emily, man. She gets things done. I'm Troy, by the way. - Paul. Good to meet ya, Troy. You want one of these? - No. Dude, it'll take the edge off. - No. - Are you sure? Who did this to you? - Just some passerby's like you guys. That's why I got so defensive when you startled me. It wasn't the Horsemen? - No. - I take it you're not a vessel then. - Vessel? - Yes, that's what we have to call ourselves now. The term believer will get you killed, man. - We're a new movement called the Lions of Judah, a body of believers that don't have to live in fear anymore. Nah, I'm not a vessel. - Not yet at least. - Here. Drink up, man. As soon as you're feeling better we're headed outta here. - Headed out? - Up the mountain. Every year we head up there. There's some friends of ours up there. We've actually been doin' it the last couple of years. - I'll be fine right here. I can take care of myself. Yeah right. - By yourself, out here? No way, you'll be dead. - Why are you doin' this? You don't even know me, you don't know my past! - Man, we all got a past. And if I were in your shoes, I'd expect somebody to do the exact same thing for me. - So you're comin' with us? - That's what you think. You don't have a choice. - Let's just say I'll think about it. Hey, guys. If it's all right, can we hold up a moment? - Yeah, let's take a break here for a little while. - I think it bled through again. You might need to re-wrap it. - Let me take a look at it. Ooh. Sorry. It doesn't look infected, but we'll have to stay off of it for a while. - Well, I hate to break it to you, man, but we're still a couple days out. I mean, I can carry your bag for you if you think it'll help. - I'm okay. I got it, I got it. - Go sit down. - I just need a little rest. I'll be good. - You know, man, we've been walking for a few days now, almost a couple of weeks, and if I ever met a man of a few words, I guess, well, that'll be you so do you want to tell us anything about you? Where'd you come from? How'd you get here? I mean, just anything you'd like to share. Anything at all. - I know I can be quiet at times. I know I keep to myself. I just have a lot on my mind. And, Troy, to be honest, what does it matter at this point where I come from? I don't know you guys any better than you know me. I have no idea what my tomorrow looks like or even where we're goin' for that fact. - Paul, look. I know it hasn't been easy. It's obviously been really hard. But if it helps, I was living in Virginia when everyone vanished. I was an alcoholic, a drug addict. I was addicted to heroin. All I could think about was my next fix. It was my god, it was what I worshiped. I was so strung out that it took me a few days to realize what had actually happened. But I'm clean now. I have been for a few years. At my worst, that's when God met me. He showed me who he really is. He gave me a second chance. - Yeah, my story isn't much different. I'm from Upstate New York. I had just lost my job and the love of my life. I had a lotta money and a lotta things, but the breakup left me deeply in debt. And I'm sorry to say, the night of the vanishings I was trying to kill myself. But, luckily, that night I didn't die. Someone was watching over me. I mean, I shoulda died, ya know? And it just wasn't my time. And that's when I became a believer. - When the Government mandated that everyone be marked and they did a search and seizure of every home for bibles and new believers, they were killing you on the spot. I knew that's when I had to get out. That's when I had to leave town. And that's when I found, Troy. Kind of like we found you. - You know, listening to you both it's unbelievable to think that that moment, still today, defines who we are. I can't believe it's been over three years already. Seems like it was almost yesterday I was with my wife Rose and my daughter Ana. It was her 12th birthday. She was so excited, so full of life. I could hardly get her to go to bed. It was a perfect day. Life was perfect. I forgot to close the garage door. I went outside and boom. Everything erupted into chaos. I flew back in the house to see 'em... They were gone. Gone forever. - Paul, I mean. It's been a rough time on everybody, but they don't have to be gone forever, if you-- - Troy. I know you're a good guy. I know you have good intentions, but I'm not in the mood for a sermon right now. I don't feel like bein' preached at. There is nothing that can bring them back. Because there is no God! There never was and there never will be! Come on. We should get goin'. The sun'll be setting soon. - All right, guys, grab anything you think we can use. And, just for the record, if you find any cigarettes, they're mine, all right? Paul, did you find something there? - Nope, no, nothin' over here. - All right. Looks like we found the kitchen. - Let's take what we can, non-perishables. - Hey, if you all got this, I think I'm just gonna go see what else I can find. - All right, how about parking lot, 15 minutes? Sounds good. You know, God, I really don't think you exist. And yet I just can't explain how everyone just vanished. Just gone. My wife, my daughter. Why God, why would you take my family? Why? Why did you take my family? Doesn't matter how loud I yell. I know you're not gonna answer. Where are you? I was a good person. I sat in these chairs before! At a church just like this! I was a good father, a good husband! But they're gone and I'm still here! Yelling at a god that I don't believe in. I wanna believe. I really do. But I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't hear you! Where are you? Where are you? I really need you just to give me something. Give me something to prove you exist. God, I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Please. Please. - We gotta get up there. - Paul? Paul, we're coming! - Paul, we're coming! - Paul! Paul? - Paul. Paul. - Where is he? Paul, are you okay? - Paul? - Give me the bottle, Paul. - No. - Give me the bottle. - Paul, what are you doing? - No! I'm not givin' you the bottle. I'll tell you what, I'll give you the bottle if you can get your god to give my family back. - You know we can't do that, Paul. Give me that. We all lost someone that night! - Paul, God's given us all a second chance to make things right. - All the time with this God crap. Do you hear yourself? It's all that comes outta your mouth! - Paul. - Oh listen, a loving god would not take away our family. Wouldn't take away our friends. He allows all this destruction, that's not love, that's hate. - No, we've all done things in our past, and we have to pay for those things, Paul. But we can be forgiven still. - Forgiven? Forgiven. Forgiven. You have no idea. You just don't understand the unspeakable things I've done. I cannot be forgiven. - We know what you did, Paul. We know who you are. I mean, come on, we put it together forever ago. The military uniform and the scars on your face. We were giving you a chance, a chance to just tell us the truth. I mean, who are we to even judge you, but I do know that even you can be forgiven. - So I hear there's this guy baptizing a lotta people. I wanna know his name, I wanna know where he is, and I wanna know now! Look up at me, look at me! I will seek, I will find, and I will destroy! Not gonna talk, huh? Well, now, this is gonna happen. Let's go, move! Move! Keep moving! Move, move! Just like sheep before the slaughter! That's right, keep going. No, no! - All of this! - All right, people! On down, down! - Shut up! Show some respect. - So what's it gonna be? Stump or squad? Squad. - You three! - Back up. Back up! Head on through here, come on, go, go! Get on down there! Keep going, move, run! Please, run. Get down, down, on the floor, knees! On the floor now. Wait right here. Nobody move or you die! - Hold still. Hold still. - Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Now who's a believer? Time to go. - No, no. - You are a believer! - No! - I heard about you. Out there preaching the truth. You want the truth? - No. - You want the truth? The truth is, there is no god! And you, you missy, you're a believer too, aren't you? - No, no. - Yes, you are! Time to join your believer friends. Welcome to Judgment Day! Get up! Don't you think about moving. Get up! - Stay there, sweetie. You're a believer, aren't you? - No! - You're a believer, aren't you? - No, no. - Prove it! Being 'em in, bring 'em here! You're gonna prove it. You're gonna prove you're not a believer. - On your knees. - On your knees. Take it. - No! - You're gonna kill him, take it! Kill him! Now you're gonna lose your hand. Hold still! Get over here! - This is your time, this is your time! Get over here! Get down, quiet down! Put him down! Do you denounce God? - No! - Do you denounce God? - No! God, help! - Then you're gonna die! - No! - Hey, Paul, I think he lost something. - Get over here! - Let's go! Let's go! Come on, it's time to die. Come on. Put her down there. Get on there. Do you denounce God? - No. - Do you denounce God? - No! - Then you're gonna die! Hold her. - Paul, what are you doing? - Daddy? No. - Paul, you stay with the mission! You finish this! Where's Pierce? - You finish this! - Paul, what is wrong with you? You finish that! Look at me. I'll show you how to finish it. Paul, this is how you finish it! Who's next? - No, no, no, no! - Paul, he'll see you now. Come on. Over here. - Have a seat, Paul. Obviously, you know why you're here today. What happened out there today? I've never seen you freeze up like that before. - I don't know. I don't know what happened. For a moment, I felt like I saw... My wife there on the killing block. My daughter in the lineup. - You know what I saw? I saw weakness. This resistance doesn't tolerate weakness. You know that the State is the only master, and we do the Government's work, and we do it well. You know the deal you signed up for. You broke the contract. - General, I know my contract. I know what I signed up for. I've been here long enough to know what we do for the Government. But have you ever stopped for just a moment? Have you stopped to think that maybe what we're doing is wrong? Maybe all these people that vanished, maybe they're right. - Sounds to me like you want out. You have two options. One, you stay in, you stay with us. Or two, well. You know what the Horsemen do to people. Answer him. Come on, answer him. - I can't. I can't get that image outta my head. Davis, I can't do it anymore. I'm out. I'm out. - You're out? You're out? Paul, you've done a lotta good work for the Horsemen, but now I can't help you. It's over. Tomorrow at dawn, I want you to take him out and beat him within an inch of his life, but don't kill him. I want him to live in fear for the rest of his life. Yes, sir. I'll make sure of it. - Where you goin', boy? You gon leave without saying goodbye, huh? I got some things I wanna say to you. Look at me, boy. You just gonna leave your brothers like that, huh? You gonna betray your brothers, huh? For your stupid family, huh? You think you're in heaven right now? You're little girl's burning in hell going, "Daddy, Daddy!" - Shut up! - I'm gonna leave you for dead, boy, you understand me? - You're a traitor, you hear that? You betrayed us, you traitor! - Well, hey. - Hello. - Well, hi, Paco. It's good to see you! - Hi! Hey, Tim? - Tim! - Tim! - We made it! Tim! - Tim! Where is he? - Tim! Where's Tim? Don't do that! - I got y'all good, didn't I? - You're gonna get yourself hurt. - Hey! - What's goin' on, man? Nice to see ya. - How you doin'? - Good, good, hey. - Good to see you. - This is Paul. - Paul? - This is Tim. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - All right, y'all come on in. - Yeah, let's do it. - Make yourselves at home. Hope y'all don't mind breakfast for dinner. Man, I could eat breakfast any time of the day. - Is that okay with you, Paul? - Yeah, sure. You know, Tim, it's a nice place you have here. - Yeah, I had it for about 15, 20 years or so, and I made it home for the past few years. So you knew we were coming then? - It's the same time each year. I had a feeling. But, if not, then this big feast would have been all mine. - We're not lettin' that happen. - It's just about ready. I know y'all hungry. - It looks excellent. You okay there? - I don't think you understand how good bacon is. I mean, it's proof that there is a god. What can be more divine than bacon? - Troy. Well, it is the best proof I found so far. So, Tim, how'd you end up here? - Wow. On a darker note. Like all of us, we all have a past. I used to be in ministry. I would teach the word, but I didn't believe in it. You see, my grandfather and my father were pastors so I felt pressure to do the same thing. It's funny how you can be so close to the truth yet still blinded by it. In the end, we see what we wanna see. Yeah, isn't that the truth. - Yeah. Anyways, I want y'all to meet somebody Friday morning. His name is John, and he's taught me things that I never would have learned or seen. He's turning new people into vessels. He kinda stay to himself. He lives off the land, kinda like John the Baptist type stuff. Locusts and flies and everything, honey. I think it'll be cool for you to meet him. - Wow, he sounds really incredible. Can't wait to meet him. How's it goin'? - I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. I baptize you with water, but there is one who comes after me who will baptize you with fire and he will leave-- - That's the guy I was telling you about the other night. That's him. - John. - Yeah, that's John. Just have one more step. You wanna do it? - Come to the water and be baptized, and renew your faith. What's your name? - Paul. - Come. John, I need those things that you were just talking about. I need to be cleansed, renewed. I wanna know what truth is again. - Paul, because of the desires of your heart, and your profession of faith, your eyes will now be open. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Everyone, come, come and be baptized! Only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him will not die but you will have eternal life in Him. You got time for a quick chat? - Yeah, sure thing. Have a seat. Oh, by the way, thanks for today. - You don't have to thank me. It's my pleasure. It sure is beautiful out here, huh? Ah, yeah. It's so peaceful. - You know, this last year I have baptized so many people. People from all nationalities, backgrounds. I tell you though, today, there was just something different. I don't know what it was, but I just felt something, something in my spirit. - Yeah. You know, last week when we were headed this way we came across an abandoned church. We were just kinda makin' our way through, lookin' for water, supplies and stuff like that, and I just went off on my own and I found myself in the sanctuary all alone. All of a sudden, I just got so angry and just started yelling at God. It's interesting. It's interesting how people can just go and blame God for things. And at the same time, they don't even believe in him. That night, I fell to my knees at the altar, and I begged him to prove himself to me. And then today, I walk up and hear you speaking and baptizing people and it just started pulling at my heart. This feeling started rising up inside of me, and I couldn't fight it anymore. I just had to let go and step forward. For the first time in my life, I feel like my eyes are finally open. - You know, as you're talking it reminds me the story of Jesus and Peter. You know, Jesus looks and he calls Peter to step on the water, and Peter's bold. He does it and he's the only that does. And this scenario shows us that there's lightning, wind, waves, all sorts of stuff goin' on. And then Peter does what I think's relevant to all of us at a time where we take our eyes off of him, and he begins to sink. No matter what the storms, no matter what the trials, no matter the things that we go through, depression, loneliness, fear. As long as we keep our eyes on him, there's no way we'll ever sink. Yeah, makes a lotta sense. - Well, my friend, I don't know what you're journey is but always remember, keep your eyes on him. I'm heading out tonight, and I pray for you that God would bless your journey. Well, where you headed? - Wherever the spirit leads me. All right, till we meet again. - Johnny boy! You know, you're a tough man to track down. But here you are. You have no idea how much joy it brings me to see you like this. Got a little blood there. So your vessels as you call them, where are they? Where they headed? John, I asked you a question. Where are they? - In God's hands. - Yeah, I'm sure they are. How's this for God's hands? - Yeah. - We just found John! - What? - What? - John, he's out in the woods, like a quarter mile out. - What do you mean? - He's dead! - What? - What? - He's dead. - What is he doing-- Okay, we gotta get outta here. We have to get out of here. - It's too late, they're here. Get down on the ground! - Get down! - Get down on the ground! Stop resisting or we'll shoot you! Let her go! Come on, come on! - All right. - No! Let's go, come on. Keep it goin', come on! Come on! Get up, get up! - Come on! - Call this in, let 'em now we got 'em. - Basically, we got 'em, we're taking out the transportation now. ETA, 30 minutes. - Get down! Yeah, I can hear you now. - Welcome to Shield! You will be here until our quarterly judgment is finished. You will not know the time, the day, nor the hour, but I promise you, Judgment Day is coming. If you attempt to flee, we will kill you. If you disobey our orders, we will punish you accordingly. Remember, each and every one of you are no longer human. But you are lambs to our slaughter. Stop it! You know what, stop it! Tim, shut up! - What's your name, sir? My name is Tim, who are you? Get this thing off me! - Hi, Timmy. I'm General Davis. - You have no power over me. Unless it has been given from above. - God itn't gonna help you today. Men, let's show 'em what we do with people who disobey. - Get offa me! - That's enough, stop! Who said that? - I did, I'll take his place. - Show me your face, son! Well, well, well. Hello, Paul. Now I shoulda killed you the first time! What we have here is a real hero! He used to be one of us! Now, he's one of you. - Come on, get up, get up! - Get up! - Move, come her, boy! - Back up, back up, back up! Get down here! Get him, shove him down, get him down. Get in here, come on, get in, get in! Get in there! Get your hands in there, get your hands in there. Do not move, do not move. You were like a brother to me! I woulda died for you! You think you're one of them? You wanna be one of them? Well, now you're gonna bleed like one of 'em. - Paul! - Shut up! - Is that the whore you replaced your wife with? Ooh, you didn't like that, did ya? You ain't gonna like this either! How many lashes? - 39. - You could kill him. - I'm doing what you should have done a while ago. - 39! Begin! Look at him, you! Mercy! Mercy, please, please, mercy! - You really want more? You really want more? All right. I told you to stay down! - That's enough, untie him. - This is mine now, brother. - Where's your god now? Where's your god now? Get him back in there! - The only god you're gonna know is pain! - Looks like dinner's here. 10 points for me. - All right, I'll match ya. - Yeah, right. - I got you guys beat, ready, ready? - Yeah, go Em! - Ah! 10 points for me. I still can't believe Tim is gone. - I know. Runnin' away was so stupid. They shot him in the back, they didn't even think twice about it. - You know, Troy, he shoulda known better. There's no getting outta this place. But at least he's with god now. And his family. - Everybody out! Let's go, let's go, get over here! - All right, let's go, get out, move! Move, move, now! Come on, now! Go, go, let's go! Get out, let's go! - Now! - Don't fuckin' move! - Get out now, go, go! You now go, go, go, now! - Get outta there, go, go! - Come on, let's go! Go, get outta there, go! I said get up! Go! - Get out now, get out now! - Get out! Go, go, go! - Move! - Get a move on! - Move, move! Let's go, come on, let's go! Where's your god at now? - Let's go now, move, move! - My name's General Davis, and I'm the commanding general for the Horsemen, and today's Judgment Day. You have one simple question to answer. Will you denounce God? - I don't know. Please don't kill me, please. - Oh, cupcake, it's a simple question. - I never knew him, I don't, I don't know. You never what? - I never knew him! - Get her outta here! Get her outta here! Go, go, move! Oh, what do we have here? A piece of filth! - Do you denounce God? - If you let me live. - Really? - Yes. I don't wanna let you live, but if you denounce him, I will. - I denounce him! Get outta here, get! Get outta here! - Let's go, move! - Come on! - Move, move! - Get on the ground! - Get on the ground! Get on the ground! - You denounce him? - You gonna denounce him? Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Get outta here! - Get outta here, get! - Are you ready for this? Come on, let's go. - Scum, scum, go, go, go! Move, go! Move! Paul, show me your hands. Time's up, get down! - Paul! - Stay down! - Paul! - Come on! - Let's go, come on, get down! - Paul! - Wait your turn! Wait your turn! Not okay. - You see all these vessels? None of them are willing to die for your invisible god. So I'm gonna ask Paul, before all these people, do you denounce God? I will shoot you! - Thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I said I will shoot you! - I will fear no evil. - Enough, Davis! - Shut your mouth! - Haven't we killed enough people already? I will fear no evil. For you are with me. - Shut up! I will fear no evil, for you are with me. I will fear no evil, for you are with me. I will fear no evil, for you are with me. - I said shut your mouth! - I will fear no evil, for you are with me. I will fear no evil. - Get on the ground! - For you are with me. - Paul! I am so sorry! Forgive me, please! I'm sorry! - Come on! - Get off me, Paul, I'm sorry! Get him up! Will you denounce him? - Do not be afraid. I will not denounce my God! - Let's go! - Get up, come on! - Get down! - Get on the ground! Will you denounce him? - No. - Never! - Will you denounce God? - Oh, hi, I didn't know anyone was still here. - No, it's okay. - Hi, I'm Paul. Good to meet you. - Emily. - Emily? - Good to meet you too. Hold on a second. Hey, guys, good to see ya. Will. Hey, Paul, nice to see ya. Hey, Troy, nice to finally meet you. - Good to meet you. Come on in. - I'm heading out. - All right, have a good one. Bye. - All right, guys, so I'm really happy that you were able to come over on such short notice. This house just came on the market. It's a four bedroom, two and 1/2 bath so what do you say we take a look around? - Yeah- - I like the foyer. - The kitchen is straight through here. Oh, hey, hon. Oh, Ana. Hey, baby girl, how are you doing? Oh, sweetie, I know, I'm sorry, I know. I know I said I'd come to church. Baby, don't say that, you are first. You know that, don't say that. Sweetie, I'm sorry, I really don't have time to talk right now. Can we talk when I get home? Hello? Ana? Ana? Hey, hon, can you do me a favor? Don't let me forget to talk to Pastor Tim about that cabin retreat after service. - Sure, I won't let you forget. - Okay, great. All right, let's go. - Hi, Mr. Davis. - Hey, Ana!
