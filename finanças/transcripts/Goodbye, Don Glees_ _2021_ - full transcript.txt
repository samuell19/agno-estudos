[serene music] [phone rings] [ominous music] [phone continues ringing] [door creaks] [Drop] Hello? [Roma] Back then, death wasn't really something I gave much thought to, or just how certain it was. [Roma and Toto pant] Dude, do you really think they're gonna just let us ride our bikes into the airport? How should I know? But hey, guess we're gonna fight out in a minute since the Sanso rail line isn't running anymore. Ah, this is what I hate about living out in the boonies. [horn honks] [grunting] - Roma, are you okay? - [Roma] There it is! [plane engine whirs] [Roma] We didn't have a clue back then, but just outside of our town, there was a door that led to the whole world. [both chuckle] [dramatic music] [plane engine whirs] [gentle music] Naw, Kamogawa's gonna smell like cow pies again. [chuckles] [boy 1] ♪ Don Glees, acorns, tumbling down ♪ ♪ Till they all go landing in the crop-own ground ♪ Hey, Roma! Are you taking off on me again? Oh, come on. All right, but next time, I'm cutting off your allowance! I'm serious about that! You hear me? [Roma coughs] [music continues] [register beeping] Let me guess. You're going to see the fireworks tomorrow? - [Roma] Mm-hmm. - Yes, I had a feeling somehow. I don't see the need in getting dressed up in your yukatas. - Got any lighters? - Uh. I do, actually. You can just have this one. Oh, and Roma, be sure to give your dad my thanks for the tomatoes he brought me, okay? [Roma] Okay. [music continues] [indistinct chattering] [Roma chuckles] - Toto! - Huh? - [Roma] Hey, man. - Oh, hey, what's going on? The Don Glees are reunited. [Sister] Hokuto, what time are you gonna be back home? Dad wanted to know so he could schedule your tutor - and all that. - Yeah, yeah, I got it. Just tell him I won't be long. So, why are you blond? I got it done in the city. [Roma] Wow, so fancy. [laughs] Don't be such a hick. [grunts] That's a nostalgic smell. Oh, uh, I didn't mean you, sorry. [Roma] So what's it been like studying in Tokyo? A lot of cute girls, I bet. [Toto] Hmm, I guess. [Roma] Well, I've been here manning the fort all by myself since you left me behind. Hey, I told you to apply with me. You're the one who decided to stick it out here in the country. [Roma] Well, yeah, I know that. But it's not like I could have actually kept up with you. I mean, you're going to medical school and everything. I wasn't saying you had to apply to the same school as me. What the heck? Why'd you pick up so many fireworks? 'Cause we had so little action last year. And the place I went to was loaded so I got as much as I could carry. See? Look it, 50 shots of golden fireworks. Oh, good. And you want me to split the bill, right? [Roma] Every year, all our classmates would go to firework festivals in the towns next to ours. Look at you! [laughs] [voice over] But the two of us, - we never got invited to join. - [indistinct chattering] Here comes the big finish! The Niagara Falls special. Fire! [Toto and Roma] Come on. [Roma] If we wanted to see a real show, we would always look up videos from the fireworks in Sumida River. [Roma] Cool. Is that an aerial shot? [Toto] Yeah, I bet they used a drone. [Roma] It was humble, sure, but it was our yearly tradition. Little did we know, this summer was gonna be different. [Drop] Come in, Roma, this is Drop. It finally went down, over. [Roma] For real? Oh, uh, over. It's our first summer vacation as high school students, and the Don Glees was about to get itself a new member. [Roma and Toto gasp] [Drop] Yeah, for real. Let's go! [Roma] His name was Drop. - Come on, hurry! - [Toto] Hey, wait for me! [boys laughing] So this is what we're buying? Yeah, you bet we are. I told you we could afford it if we just stayed patient. [Roma] Mm-hmm. If I spend everything I've got, I can do it. Ugh. Hey, can we have a word? Okay, seriously, are you sure this grade schooler isn't trying to mess with us or something? I mean, I don't even know who he is. Well, his name's Shizuku Sakuma, and he's our age. Doesn't Shizuku mean drop in English? That's right. It's not 'cause of the Sakuma fruit drops? Ugh. Roma, you should think this through, buddy. Oh, I have, just like I'm sure you thought through getting that haircut. Just shut up. Even if you do buy that fancy drone, all you're gonna film is 20 lousy shots of golden fireworks. There's 50 shots. Well, it's not like you can get aerial footage of the fireworks festivals from here. Yeah, that's what the drone is for, remember? You said it was okay for us Don Glees to have our own little festival. Yeah. Uh, about that Don Glees name... Roma, if we buy the drone, they'll throw in this extended battery! Oh, nice! Don't worry. This one's all on me. Hmm. [gulps] [knocking] [Father] Roma. - Hey, Roma. - Ah, huh? Did you hear what I just said about the spinach? Your uncle wanted your input. He just created a whole new breed of spinach, but he still hasn't come up with a name for it yet. You see? Oh, look at how huge those leaves are. Isn't that cool? Probably the biggest spinach in the whole world! Yeah, really cool. Oh, boy, there's that teenage angst, or edginess, or whatever it is you kids call it these days. They've been giving cool names to spinach breeds so that the little kids will actually wanna try to eat them, you know. I think the last one was called the Kaiser. You're a creative guy. Come on, try and help out your uncle. Uh. [Mother] It's pretty gigantic. Anything come to mind off the top of your head? I was thinking like the King Popeye. I would cook with that. The World? [Toto] You're not gonna believe this. My dad told me she moved to Ireland! - Overseas? - Try giving her a call. Right now? I don't know if this is the best time. I can barely read my own handwriting. Okay, here we go. It's 354... Wait, no, what are you doing? Calling her for you 'cause you don't have a smartphone. [Roma] But I'm not ready! Well, too bad 'cause I gotta go to cram school. 212. If you wanna say something, do it now. Whoa, hold on! Do we even know if she really moved? Don't worry about the phone bill. I am gonna be rich when I grow up after all. Oh, yeah, you make it sound so easy. [phone rings] Hmm. No answer. Isn't there a time difference? Yeah, but it's past six in the morning over there, so it's fine. - Then we're gonna wake her up! - Hey, you were the one who wanted her number in the first place! I get that it's scary to go at something like this alone, but this will be your last act of bravery as a 15-year-old and I wanna be right next to you to see it. If you believe in yourself, you'll finally get what you want for once. - What? - [Roma] I got chores to do. And until next summer, I'm still 15. But we're finishing junior high. I already spoke with the counselor. I'm going to Taki High School. They have a farming course, and I could commute there by bike. Oh, uh, it's just, it's brand new to the world, right? That just made me think of that mythical ash tree, the one with the branches that reach out everywhere, the world tree, Yggdrasil. - Ah. - Huh? [Roma] Thanks for dinner! - Ah. - Huh? He wants to boil and eat the world tree? [door shuts] [drone whirs] Dude, it's so loud. Yeah, it's something all right. I pretty much know how to control it. One problem though. We can't save any images to our phones. Is it broken or just an error? Well, did you remember to get an SD card? [Roma] Oh, yeah, the images will get saved to that. Ugh, why'd you have to go and spend all your savings on something that doesn't even work? We can still use the drone. We just can't use the app. And hey, you agreed getting it was a good idea. Yeah, a whole year ago. - That's not trash. - You're right. It's treasure. Hey, don't you wanna look down on it all? [Toto] What, on the fireworks? On the world. Huh? I mean, let's say the world came to an end tomorrow. If that happened, would you have any regrets? [Toto groans softly] [Drop] I know I would. I think my biggest regret would be not finding my greatest treasure of all that's out there in this big wide world, just waiting for me to discover it. [gentle music] [Drop] That's why I always dreamed that I could see what the world looks like from above. If you build up some courage and take a leap, you can see things you never could before. And the treasures you always wanted could be seen from above and you'd realize they're lying right at your feet. Wouldn't that be amazing? If I could ever find treasure like that, it'd prove that I'm here, that I'm strong and alive. At least that's what I think. I, uh... Yeah, what is he talking about? - Uh... - Ah! But still, looking down at the whole world, I bet that would be pretty cool. I know. That's why we should do it. Actually, I'm pretty sure cool means something different to each of us. Still, I'd love to look down at these guys from way up high. [growls] Bunch of morons. [Roma scoffs] [Drop] Then let's look down on them. You're thinking about doing it someday but who knows when that someday will come. No more waiting. Let's just do it right now. Uh, do what? We're gonna teach 'em a lesson they will never forget. [laughs] - We are? - [Drop] Come on, Roma. Come on where? - It's cool. - The two of us will help you. Whoa, wait. What do you mean? We're friends, aren't we? Let's just all take the leap. [Bully] Just admit it already. Who do you got a crush on? They're all ugly as hell. Yeah, but all that means is I might have a chance to score tonight. Seriously? You're gonna be a virgin for the rest of your life. [Bully] Ow. What was that for? That hurt, you know. Huh? [dramatic music] [bully whimpers] [Drop] Mm-hmm. [bully sighs] [group whispers] Hey, wasn't that Kamogawa? He didn't smell like cow pies. They all smelled amazing! Ew, they're drooling. [girl] Oh, gross. [laughs] Holy crap! That was the coolest! I can't believe I just did that! [laughs] [laughs] They really thought the two of us were a couple of smoking hot girls. If my sister finds out I wore her clothes and makeup, - she's gonna freaking kill me! - [Roma screams] [Toto] We're not ever doing that again! [group pants] [Toto] Please explain how you knew how to dress us up like real women. You even knew how to do the makeup. [Drop] Well, the last time I went to the hospital, I met this nice girl who was trying to become a stylist. The hospital? Yeah. She taught me a whole lot in a short amount of time. Doing makeup's a lot like drawing. It's fun. Wait, Drop, you were in the hospital? Mm-hmm. In fact, that's actually where I got this wig from too. That so? - Who would have thought. - [Drop laughs] The look on their faces is still cracking me up. [laughs] Oh, Roma, I was so wrong about you. [Roma and Drop laugh] Shut up. You're making my sides hurt! - Oh, you smell so good. - Whoa, hey, hey. You stay away from me! [all laughing] I'm gonna get you! Hey, hey, stop it, I mean it! Get off me right now! [all laughing] [Roma and Toto] K-O! [fireworks blast] It's starting. [Drop] Hurry, let's go! [Roma] Quick, grab the drone! Sun's going down already? [Roma] Here we go. [drone whirs] [Drop] It's windy. Then let's forget it. I told you guys this would never work. - Start the countdown. - Put that down. Don't worry, I got it. - Three, two... - Wait. - Hold on! - [Drop] One. - Zero. - [Toto shrieks] - [Drop] Okay, get ready. - [Roma] Ah! Ah! - [Drop] Quick, over here. - [Roma shouting] [Drop] Blast off! [Roma shouting in distance] Uh-oh. Wait, wait! Hmm, that's weird. Would you give me that! [Roma screams] Where is it even going? Bunch of duds! Where'd you even get these? - [Roma] Mrs. Ando's shop! - [fireworks blasting] Well, that explains why they don't work, because they're probably a bunch of freaking antiques. - [fireworks crackle] - [Toto shrieks] - Oh, great! - [grunts] Okay, that's it. Roma, I am going home! - It's lit. They're lit! - [Toto shrieks] Not good. [shouting] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - I got it. - It blew away! Look! [Drop] Whoa, look at how high it went. Now what do we do? Give it! - [fireworks blast] - [crowd cheers] [Roma] Wait, wait, wait, wait, - wait, wait, wait, wait! - [Toto] Get back down here! - Oh. - Look at it. It's so pretty! [toilet flushes] [Toto] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! [Roma] I spent my entire life savings! - [fireworks blast] - [crowd cheers] - [fireworks blast] - [crowd cheers] [panting] [crowd cheers] It's done for. So are we. We flew a drone at night and it's against the law. I didn't know that. I am so dead. My sister's never gonna let me live this down. Which one of you talked me into doing this? - Roma. - Yeah, I know. - Don't rub it in. - [mosquito buzzes] [Toto] Ugh, great, another mosquito bite. Just burn the whole woods down for all I care. - [siren blares] - Huh? You hear that? Are those sirens? - [Toto] Run! - What for? Because we're gonna get arrested for flying that drone! Hold on, I think it's a fire truck. Huh? Hey, does it smell like something's burning? Huh? [ominous music] A fire? [siren blares] [Announcer] Emergency vehicle passing. Please wait. [ominous music] [rain splatters] [siren blares] [Drop] It's a good thing we got rain. Yeah, but this is totally crazy though. Our neighborhood's on TV. Look, there's our fields of everything, see? Roma, have you looked online yet? They're blaming us for the mountain fire! Uh, they are? But why? I don't get it. No, no, no, no. This cannot be happening! [Drop] Wait, did we leave the fireworks behind? Or do you think somebody took them? It doesn't matter. Those creeps are the ones behind this and now they're framing us as criminals! It couldn't have been because of us. We couldn't even light our... Oh, I guess, but we put them out. Stop. You really think they're gonna care? There's no way to prove our innocence! Except for the fact that we didn't do it. I'm telling you that's not good enough because our word doesn't matter to anybody! Damn it, I knew I shouldn't have done this. What now? Should we try to explain it to the police? No, we can't do that. My dad cannot know about this! Then... what can we do? [Drop] How about we go look for the drone? [Toto] This is so not the time for that. Ugh, I bet this is just them trying to get back at us for messing with them. Oh, my stomach. But Roma spent all his savings on it. And plus, we never got a look at the footage from last night, not even one time. [Roma] Don't remind me. The drone. - Hm? - Huh? - Ah, and the footage. - Yeah, what about it? What is it? Yeah, he's right. - About? - [Toto] No, no, no. Because the footage can help us. - It's our alibi. - Oh, no, you don't! - Yeah, right! - That's the one thing - we can't use! - [Drop] Why not? [Roma] All we have to do is find that SD card. I just hope the footage came out all right. Tell me you're not being serious right now. Unless we can get our hands on it, everybody's gonna keep on blaming us. But if we give them the card, that means they're gonna be able to see everything we were doing. [Drop] Oh, yeah. I guess they're gonna know then. Everyone will know that I put on my sister's dress and makeup and then I put a couple of balloons under my shirt to look like boobs. Oh, yeah. - So did I. - Look, it's still better than being called arsonists, right? [Toto] You say that, but I don't know which one is worse. Well, if those jerks think we're just gonna give in, they've got another thing coming. We're gonna do whatever it takes to prove that we're innocent. - [Roma groans] - [thuds] The wind took it so far away. That extended battery can really hold a charge. [Roma] Hmm, we can't take the train. [Toto] Duh, it's in the middle of a mountain. We can walk. Sure, if you want it to take forever. Oh, what about your sister's car? [Toto] Oh, no way. If I take her car too, then I'm gonna be double dead. It looks like it landed on a road by the river. So if we take our bikes, we can get about halfway. There's also a good chance we're not gonna find it right away, so we should definitely pack enough in case we have to camp out for a night there. Overnight? Toto, the Perseid meteor shower can be our excuse. Smart, right? [Toto] This is not the time to be celebrating! [Roma] At the time, Toto made fun of us for getting so excited about it, but I couldn't help myself. Uh, tomorrow, I'm gonna stay over at Toto's. [Mother] Okay. And we'll be going to the pool the day after that, - so I might be home late. - [Mother] Wait! Aren't you gonna finish your dinner first? [Roma] For some reason, I just had this crazy feeling that this year's summer would be different from all the rest. [Drop] Have you ever been to the other end of this tunnel? [Roma] No, never. [Drop] Then we're in for our first adventure. Hey, do you not have a bike? [Drop] Nah, but it's fine. This thing's like an old friend. This is my last adventure. I wanted to be there to take it all in. - Your last? - [Toto] Hey! I'm here! [Roma and Drop laugh] [Drop] Is that your sister's bike? What else was I supposed to do? I left mine back in Tokyo, okay? Yeah, that's fair. Well, should we get going or what? Let's see what's on the other side. [upbeat music] ♪ If I go to the other side ♪ ♪ Will I find anything there ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't know ♪ ♪ I've never been outside of here ♪ ♪ Outside of here ♪ ♪ I've only ever known this tiny world ♪ ♪ There's no way I'm letting this go ♪ ♪ It's kind of exciting ♪ ♪ But also kinda scary, right ♪ ♪ But if I go with my friends, it could be fun ♪ ♪ It could be fun ♪ ♪ I have a feeling that something's about to change ♪ ♪ There's no way I'm letting this go ♪ ♪ Let's explore my new world ♪ ♪ Let's explore my new world ♪ ♪ We are gonna make it good ♪ [Drop] Keep out? [Roma] Ugh, for real? [Toto] I can't believe the wildfire spread so far so fast. Why are you packing up? Because we gotta go on foot now, up that way. Wait, we talked about this. I thought the whole plan was for us to take this road to the river. We'll get in trouble if we go that way, so this is the only option we got. Oh. Okay, cool. Roma! [Toto grunts] This better not take us in the wrong direction. [Roma] They're blaming us for all of this? We shouldn't be so close to the scene of a crime we're the main suspects of. And I'm still not sure we should even be going this way. Like if he's wrong, we could get lost out here. Yeah, I get it, but we can't take the road. So? That doesn't mean we should just follow him blindly. We could have stayed back and thought of another way to get there or something. You gotta use your head, man. - [branch snaps] - [both gasp] You hear that? [Toto] Was it a boar, or a deer? Or what if it's a bear? [suspenseful music] [both grunt] - [Roma and Toto gasp] - What'd you find? [Roma and Toto] It's the cops! [screaming] Hey, what's the rush? Book it, before they book us! Wah, we didn't do it! [Toto shrieking] Hmm? [bell rings] Would you put that stupid thing away? - We need it. - Not now! That was our bear bell. Hey, what are you guys... - [bear growls] - [suspenseful music] [boys whimpering] [bear growling] [group growls] [bear growls] [growling] Take this! Counter assault! [boys groaning] [bear growls] [group screams] [Roma screams] [all screaming] [group pants] [Toto] My eyes! [Roma] Man, that stuff was powerful. What did you just do? An anti-bear weapon. This here is what I call the counter assault, my friends! - That's my hairspray! - Whoa! We're in the middle of the mountains. What'd you even bring this stuff for? - [Toto screams] - That was amazing! [Drop] We shouldn't have tossed my bear bell. It's not like it did a whole lot of good for us anyway, okay? We still almost got killed by one. Now what? I don't know. At this rate, proving our innocence is gonna be a total long shot. - But we still didn't do it. - I get that. But even if we find the drone, it may not do us any good. - [Roma] Hey, guys. - [Drop and Toto] Huh? Where are we? [Roma] Is this a mountain trail? [Toto] This? Yeah, I don't think so. [Drop] It'll be fine. We'll just keep heading north until we reach the road by the river. You actually know which direction that is? [Drop] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way. [Toto] You're pretty sure? Well then how much longer do we have to keep walking? [Drop] Would you shut up? How am I supposed to know? You tell me. We're following you after all, unless you got us even more lost somehow. East or west doesn't matter. Both trails head north. But if we don't pick one, this adventure will be over anyways. Come on, haven't you ever taken a path that wasn't just laid out for you? [Roma] Some of us do have our whole lives all mapped out. Hang on. The soil smells different here. [Drop] Yeah? Let's go this way. You can tell just by the scent? Bingo! Look at those falls! [Roma] Yeah, it looks like a slide at a water park. Your sense of smell is insane. All thanks to that farm work I do all day. Are you taking a break? [Drop] It's just about lunchtime. Aren't you guys hungry? We didn't come out here for a picnic. It's taken us long enough as is. [Roma] Come on. We need to eat if we're gonna keep walking. And I've been starving all morning. Ah, yeah. Damn it. [Roma] This is all we packed? Where are they, my rice balls? Aw, we don't have anything to fry these potato croquettes. Gah, you idiots! What were you thinking when you packed stuff that we would have to cook? Well, I told my mom and dad I was staying at your place so I didn't wanna pack so much that it'd look suspicious. We got chicken curry, tuna, and some crab fritters too. Once we get these open, we can mix all of them together and make a curry. Perfect! Well, yeah, except nobody thought to pack a can opener! Ah, that's a bummer. This would've been great with your rice balls. Where did they go? Well... [stammers] They're bear food now. Who's hungry for chips? [Drop] Waterfalls in the forest sure are pretty, huh? It's the first time I've seen the real thing. [Roma] You've never seen a waterfall before? [Drop] Oh, sure, lots of 'em. [Roma] Huh? All the ones I've seen are a lot bigger than this one, except there aren't any trees around. They're like a humongous curtain of water draped over a gigantic wall of stone. Woo-yeah! Like that. Like the Grand Canyon? I could have sworn the Grand Canyon was in a desert. It has waterfalls. It's just a big hole in the ground. Okay. Well, all I know is it's in America. - [Drop] No, in Iceland. - Wait. So is the Grand Canyon not in the United States? - No, it is. - Hey, guys. We were talking about the ones in Iceland. - Who was? - [Drop] I was. What for? Because that's where I'd seen a lot of waterfalls. [Roma and Toto] Huh? [soft music] [Roma] You were treasure hunting? [Drop] Yeah. I was looking for a mysterious phone booth. When I was living in Iceland, I heard this story about this golden waterfall that runs through a valley so deep, it's like it's cutting the earth in half. The rumor went that there was a mysterious red phone booth standing all by itself at the foot of the waterfall. [Roma] Drop, you lived in Iceland? - Sweet. - Is it? My grandpa happened to live there, that's all. People can live anywhere, you know. Uh, yeah. [Drop] But anyways, I was on the hunt, and I was hoping that if I could just watch the waterfall turn golden from inside the booth, the phone would ring and tell me the answer. [Roma] To what? [Drop] To what my treasure is and how to find it. So you're saying that even though you've been searching for this treasure, you don't know what it is? [Toto] What kind of treasure hunt is that? It sounds like some kind of wild goose chase to me. Do either of you guys know what the treasures you've been searching for really are? I'm not talking about stuff like in a treasure chest, something you want so bad, you'll go for it no matter how hard it gets. Like it's the happy ending you've always wanted for yourself. My happy ending is finding that drone. That's what I care about more than any golden waterfalls or phone booths. Right. Hey, is Iceland anywhere near Ireland? Yeah, it is. Why? Whoa. Hey, I thought you gave that back to your dad. [Roma] Nope. I was surprised. I thought he'd give me hell about it but he said that I could keep it if I wanted to, so I did. [Toto] Huh. When was that? [Roma and Toto] In junior high. [both chuckle] We went on this field trip and I was the only kid without a smartphone. I'll never forget what happened that day. We were all really excited to take pictures on the trip. But since I didn't have a camera of my own, I dug out my dad's old one and just didn't tell him about it. [girl] That's a really cool camera. [gasps] It looks like an old model, but still, I like it. Urayasu, you're into them, cameras? Call me Tivoli. Everybody does. Ti... Tivoli. Can I see it? Oh, wow, a CCD sensor. The colors look way different than on a CMOS. - [camera clicking] - [Tivoli gasps] - Sorry about that. - No, it's okay. Really, it's fine. How'd the colors turn out, pretty? [Roma] Mm-hmm. The blue's so vibrant. What's that? Look. [Tivoli] It's a lady bug. - In mid flight? - Yup. Sometimes photography can be kind of tough, but I love it. Moments that are never going to come again are frozen in time for all eternity. And when you think about it, you're not only capturing what's happening in the picture but how you were feeling emotionally at the time you took it. It's like you're carving out one tiny little story in one tiny little corner of the world that nobody else on earth would've known about otherwise. You can feel from your head to your toes this world is definitely out there. And if anyone ever starts having second thoughts about that, all they have to do is take a look at the photos. When you think about it like that, it's amazing, right? Sorry, that must have sounded weird. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. It's nothing. I mean, I mean, it's not nothing, but I, you know what I mean. Now I'm definitely picking up a camera like that for myself while we're still out. Thanks for showing it to me. Oh, uh... Anytime! [Drop] Oh, I got it. You got a little crush on that girl. No! I absolutely did not! - He's lying. - Big time. I just thought it was cool that we could talk about photography and that she was nice and funny and smart and pretty. - Oh, was that all? - You just thought it was cool? Never mind. We were just screwing around. I'm sorry. Like you're one to talk. You never asked that upperclassman, Takamine, - out either. - No fair! Huh? I wanted to tell her how I felt but that teacher ruined it. Oh, that's right. [Toto and Roma] Putting a love letter in her shoe locker? My, my, isn't that very romantic of you, Hokuto? - [Toto and Roma laugh] - You always did - the best impressions of him. - [Toto] Yeah. Honestly, I got a lot of regrets, but I don't want you to have to live with too many, okay? So you better go for it because I can tell Tivoli's probably your treasure, right? [Roma] Not exactly. Then what? I don't know. It's just not what I'm looking for. It's something else, something... - It's not enough. - What isn't? Just something. What's that mean? [boys panting] [Roma] Could I ask a stupid question? [Drop] What's up? Just making sure we are trying to climb up the mountain, right? [Drop] Uh-huh. Okay, so why are we climbing down? [Drop] Everything that goes up eventually has to come down. [Roma] When we haven't even reached the top? [Drop] That's a good point. [grunts] Don't tell me. Yeah, you got me. - We're a little lost. - [Toto] Ah, I knew it! You don't have any idea where we're going, do you? [Drop] The sun is setting way earlier than it should be for it being summertime. [Toto] This is absolute insanity. [Roma] I wonder which way is north. [Toto] How about you check your phone? [Roma] I would if I had an app for that. I assumed we were gonna be following the main road. Download one. There's no service out here. Why not use your phone instead? I left it at home. Ah, seriously? Ugh, give me a break. It's getting really dark. Maybe we should just call it a night. Probably. I really need to eat something. - [Drop] Toto? - This time of night, we should be able to see the North Star. I am not going to let myself die out here in the middle of the for... [screams] [water splashes] Toto? [suspenseful music] [Roma] Toto! Help! Help! [Drop and Roma gasp] [Drop and Roma] Waterfall! [Roma] We're coming! Hang on! Whatever you do, don't let go! Roma, here. [Roma] Toto, grab on to the branch! [shouts] [Toto] Hurry! Let go. [Roma sighs] [shouts] [grunts, shouts] [Toto shouts] [all shouting] [all gasping] Hey, uh, is it me? Or have we been here before? And after all that walking we did, just our luck we'd be going around in one big circle, - huh? - Bingo. Is it working? Just a little wet. It's a good thing in my bag was waterproof. You really came prepared. Well, bringing waterproof gear is common sense in Iceland. That so? It's totally freezing out here. We can start a fire. Do you got a lighter? Mm-mm. Toto's got it. [Toto grunts] What's wrong? Is that your textbook? [Toto] Stupid! I knew I shouldn't have come. [Roma] Hey! Where you going? Get off! Hey, come on, don't fight. We're all just tired. Shut up! We've been on a wild goose chase this whole time! Take a look around. Are we there? [Drop] I was trying. I just figured if we kept on following the trail, - we'd find our way out. - This isn't a trail. - It's a forest! - Whatever. You know what I meant. The point is we just have to keep on walking no matter what. - It'll be all over if we don't. - Hey, calm down. That means we'll never find what we're looking for and everything's gonna come to an end. Everything already has 'cause you took us off our route from the very start! Then maybe you shouldn't have come! All you've been doing this whole time is whining and complaining! Yeah? Well, I've had it with the drone - and the fireworks. - Hey, stop it, you two. Who cares about the Don Glees? We're 16, it's lame! No, Roma's 15. But he's gonna be 16. - I'm still 15 though. - So what? We're in high school now - and you're acting like kids. - Hey, stop, guys, please! I don't even go to high school! Oh, you don't? That much is obvious. Hold it! Toto, a second ago, what did you just say... [Toto] Take that! [Roma] ...about the Don Glees? Huh? You really think everything we've been doing is lame? Just because we're in high school, this is all lame now? Whoa, whoa, hey. When I said that... Don't worry about it. - I gotta go. - Roma! [melancholic music] [Roma] It is lame. That's what I was thinking. I get why Toto said all that. We were already high school students. [Toto] He'll be fine. [static crackling] [Toto] Roma's not gonna wander too far. He wouldn't go all the way out to Tokyo with me even when I asked him to come. [Drop] Because he loves this town? [Toto] I don't know, to be honest. [Roma] I thought, what the heck am I even doing out here? [Toto] I still have to study for this test. - [Drop] A test? - [Toto] Mm-hmm. At cram school, tomorrow. You do? I had no idea. [Toto] I never said. Then you gotta get home so you can be there on time. Well, maybe the truth is I never wanted to go in the first place. To where? To take your test? [Toto] That or... to Tokyo. I know I might not look it, but I'm something of an overachiever. Yeah, Roma keeps telling me that. Your haircut makes it a little hard to believe though. You wanna be a doctor, right? That's cool. [Toto] You're judging me off my haircut? I've been studying like crazy ever since I was a kid. And how I grew up was believing that if I followed the path my dad laid out for me, I'd be able to get what I was looking for. Ugh, smokey. [Toto] But then I went to Tokyo and I realized something. Huh? When I'm in that vast ocean, smart as I am, I'm more insignificant than a water flea. And all I can do is flounder around and wonder exactly what it is I don't have. Goofing around, wasting my time in a place like this, and for what? I'm gonna fall even further behind. You shouldn't have brought that textbook with you and put that pressure on yourself. You dummy. You've been sacrificing everything up until now and working really hard already, right? But you know, Roma said he was really proud to be your friend, and I'm a little jealous of you after hearing him talk like that. I know, I know. [sobs] That's why I can't let him down. I can't let Roma see me like this. I don't know. I don't know if I even really wanna be a doctor. [Roma gasps] Hey, Toto, Drop, do you read me? Come in! Hey! Guess not. Huh. I'm gonna start looking for Roma. He couldn't have gone too far, but it may take me a little bit since it's dark. Just stay here, okay? [Toto] Hey, Drop. You know, you're a lot more considerate of a guy than I thought. [chuckles] Yeah, right. I'm getting Roma so he can see this himself. [laughs] You better not! - [water splashes] - [both shout] [gasping] Look, there are shooting stars! Hurry. Quit rushing me, will you? Huh. I'm sorry. I was a real jerk to you. [laughs] 16-year-olds are so lame. - I will drop you. - [Drop snickers] Whoa! [Roma] Whoa. - [Toto] Oh, man. - [Roma] Look at that. [Drop] It's like the sky is falling. There's a million stars. A million? I mean, if you wanna get technical, the Milky Way alone is home to 200 billion stars, and the entire universe has over a hundred billion galaxies. - Does that make sense? - No way. There's more than a hundred billion stars? [Toto] Yeah, and probably a lot more that we still don't even know about yet. It's astronomical! [Drop] You're telling me that's what we're seeing? I'm looking at a whole universe of an infinite number of stars? [Toto] Not even. The human eye can only see a few thousand at once. Right now, we're just looking at some stardust, way smaller than a fraction of a hundred billionth of what's out there. We're all pretty small in this universe, aren't we? [Roma] Toto, I'm sorry. It is about time we outgrew the Don Glees, isn't it? Don Glees sounds like donguri, which means acorns. With a silly name like that, we do sound pretty pathetic when you think about it. I don't know. I'm kind of envious of how it's like a cool secret club name, like it represented how special your friendship is no matter what the name really meant. Who came up with it? I did. But I never told you, it wasn't about acorns. Huh, it's not? [Toto] It's "don't glee." Don't glee? What does that mean again? It's, uh, happiness, that was it! Feeling good and being in high spirits. - Yeah. - Wait, what? You came up with that when we were both still in grade school? For us being so young, that's a pretty advanced word. But it doesn't make any sense. Oh, you're right, it does sound weird. [Toto] Yup. Glee is actually a noun. Using don't with a noun is incorrect. Ah. The reason I came up with it is because we were always sulking in a corner, the two of us. We didn't fit in with anybody else and that didn't give us a whole lot of reasons to smile. Don't laugh. Don't have fun. Don't be happy. A name like that fit us just right. [Drop] But that's still wrong. [Toto] Yep. Well, I was a third grader who thought he was a genius. I was actually just a little brat. No, no, that isn't what you're wrong about. - [Roma and Toto] Huh? - When you two get together, it's like every day is fun, all sparklers and fireworks. I don't know what it was like when you were kids, like before I got to meet the both of you guys. But still, getting to live life together with a friend you really love, that's great! I'd say that's the happiest thing ever! [bright music] I think that's the corniest thing I've ever heard. You must be a big hit with the girls. [chuckles] Who knows? Maybe if I went to your school, you would've seen me with a whole bunch of 'em. I don't need to see that. Yeah, pint sized playboy. ♪ Don Glees, acorns, tumbling down ♪ ♪ Till they all go splishy splashy into the pond ♪ Hang on a minute there. Are you sure you got the right lyrics? 'Cause I don't remember any splashing. I do remember the tumbling part. Yeah, it's acorns splashing into a pond. Us three are just like the song, acorns that tumbled and we splashed! [chuckles] I learned the words when I first started going to a Japanese school. Wait, really? So does that mean we got the lyrics wrong? [Drop] You got a lot of stuff wrong. Oh, man. [Roma laughs] [Roma] We may tumble, but we always make a splash. I know it wasn't the plan, but maybe Don Glees was the perfect name for us. ♪ Don Glees, acorns, tumbling down ♪ This reminds me of that other song we had to learn when we were kids. You remember, that one from English class? [Toto] Uh. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ - What was after that? - Did you seriously forget? ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ [Drop and Toto] ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ [all] ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ When the blazing sun is gone ♪ ♪ When he nothing shines upon ♪ ♪ Then you show your little light ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle all the night ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Then the traveler in the dark ♪ ♪ Thanks you for your tiny spark ♪ ♪ He could not see which way to go ♪ ♪ If you did not twinkle so ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ In the dark blue sky you keep ♪ ♪ And often through my curtains peep ♪ ♪ For you never shut your eye ♪ ♪ Till the sun is in the sky ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ [Roma] The song's just about a bunch of stars glittering in the night sky, right? I think it's more than that. It's a song of hope that even if someone gets lost and they can't find their way out of the dark and even if they can't see the sun, there's always gonna be a light that'll guide them. Yeah, but that part that goes "how I wonder what you are," I don't think gazing into the darkness of the unknown sounds very hopeful. In fact, it sounds pretty terrifying to me. If I have to choose, I'll take my happy ending. Man, English is weird. Let's just say the song is about how the stars are nice. [Drop chuckles] Roma, you always give up to easily. You quit Insutagram, didn't you? - Huh? - Hm? [Toto] It came out of nowhere, so it had me wondering. But after this talk, I think I get it. Come on, just make a post. Please, for me. You and my sister are the only followers I've got. But... Ugh, I need you to post for me, okay? I didn't even tell them where I was gonna be last night. At least my sister will see it then. Wait, did you leave your phone back home on purpose, Toto? [Toto chuckles] - Ever do this before? - Do what? You know, play hooky or run away from home. Nah. Some of my family is freaking out right now. Oh, well, whatever. It's not a big deal. [chuckles] [Roma] No service, remember? Ugh, that's right. And I wouldn't even know what to take a photo of. [Drop] How about a pic of the stars? I tried that. [Drop] Oh, no, this one's good. But look at how shaky and blurry it is. Well, I like it. Looking at it helps me picture all the stars that we saw tonight. Even when we were just looking at stardust, I thought it was so pretty. The universe is already amazing as is. Wait till they discover the rest. Oh, I got some signal. Hey, what's this one? Uh, it's nothing. I didn't actually take that one. It was Tivoli. Ah. I've never taken a photo as blue and beautiful as the one she did that day. Wasn't she trying to take a picture of a red subject though? What do you mean? Yeah, a red shooting star shining in a world of blue. The red's pretty, right? [Roma] All this time, I thought that was a flaw in the photo. What are you... Hey, I wasn't gonna let the fire die. I can forget my studies for one day and jump back into the fight another time. [chuckles] Mm-hmm, guess you're alive after all. [Roma] Suddenly it hit me just how much I hadn't seen before, from the universe beyond the stardust to the glow given off by a single thin red line in the middle of a blue world. None of it. [bird squawking] [ominous music] [dramatic music] [thunder rumbles] [bird squawking] [no audio] [no audio] [birds chirping] Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning. It's pretty chilly today. Dude, my fingers are like frozen solid. Want a towel? [Roma] Oh, thanks. Hey, did you ever find it? Find what? The golden waterfall and the red phone booth. [Toto grunts] Good morning. [laughs] Nice bedhead. Ha? Oh, yeah! Ooh, I needed that. [Drop] I did find it by the way. That's why I'm here now. I can come back to Japan, but it's a little late for me to go to high school. I was all alone and there was no guarantee that I'd find the treasure I'd been looking for. But then something hit me. At the end of the day, if you don't try to do anything, you'll never get a chance to leave your mark on the world. Even if people say it's impossible, that doesn't mean that you have to give up on your happily ever after, right? [gentle music] Remember when I asked about if the world came to an end? I think the one thing I wouldn't want is to have regrets. [Roma] "This is my last adventure." That was what Drop said before when we started all this. He wanted us to see his last adventure with our own eyes. [Toto] The reason you've been growing your hair out is so you can donate it? [Drop] Uh-huh. Since it's coming in again. It's not as long as that blonde wig, although that one was made out of fake hair anyways. I guess. [Drop] The drone's up past Route 71. So now we gotta go left. It's a good thing you were able to download that map app. No more getting lost for us, huh, Roma? [Roma] Hmm. - Uh. - Uh... [sighs] Sorry. What? Are you sure that's the right way? [Drop] Yeah. If we're gonna be crossing over that mess, we might get lost again if we let him lead the charge. What he said before, about if the world came to an end tomorrow, are you thinking what I'm thinking? I figure he means that he should do whatever it is he wants to do. Like if his life ended now, he wouldn't have to worry about having any regrets once he was gone. Let's go home. I'm really worried about Drop's health. We can come back later to find the drone, - just the two of us. - He's not gonna like that. He's 100 percent determined to find this thing. We're too far into this. There's no way we'd be able to convince him to just give up. I've also been wondering about what he learned in that phone booth. Like, what is this treasure Drop is so desperate to try and find? Honestly, I doubt that either of us would understand. There's nothing standing in the way of our futures. Here's a sign for Route 71. - Come on! - [Toto] Really? [Drop] First one to the drone wins! The two losers buy him a soda! - Huh? - What? Hey, no fair! You got a head start! [upbeat music] Where does he get all this energy from? He can beat whatever he's got, right? - He's 15. - [Toto] Yeah! If he does have some kind of health issue, with his youth, he can just power on through it. - [Roma] Right. - [Toto] For all we know, he doesn't even realize he's got any issues. He's just an invincible 15-year-old kid. You know what I mean? Do you? Because I sure don't! - [music continues] - [singing in Japanese] ♪ We are gonna have to work hard ♪ [Roma coughs] ♪ Hold your hand ♪ [Toto shrieks] ♪ Hold your hand ♪ ♪ We are together ♪ [Drop laughs] [Drop screams] [Roma grunting] [group screams] [all grunting] [groaning] [Roma] Past route 71, the path we were following was suddenly just gone. This place was like nothing we'd ever seen, like we'd found ourselves at the very end of the world. It was as if it were telling us there was no such thing as happy endings. [melancholic music] [Drop] Guys. I'm sorry. Eh, so you blew a bunch of money on that drone. Who cares? You'll be able to earn it all back from working on the farm. [Drop] It's my fault. I got us lost, and I almost got us killed. [crying] I didn't mean to do this to you guys. It's not right. If we had just stayed total strangers, we could have gone our separate ways like none of this happened. I'm sorry. [music continues] Let's go home. Roma? [Roma] You're sorry? You've gotta be kidding me. I... I'm sorry, Roma. I just... [Roma] I don't get it! Why are you apologizing? It doesn't make any sense! I don't want for us to be total strangers. We're past that point. You've dealt with all of Toto's complaining and still encouraged him. You got me to ride through that tunnel and see places I never would've seen on my own. You did that. You didn't ruin anything, Drop. I'm glad we came out here. If you keep apologizing like that, then you're making it sound like meeting us was a bad thing! The three of us are a trio. You're the one who said no regrets, so you better not be the first one to have them. We already came this far with you. Don't you dare turn your back on us now! Me and Toto are gonna search for your treasure right alongside you! We wanna see you find it! We got this far, and we're not going anywhere! Toto and I are gonna see your final act of bravery as the 15-year-old you, so just believe in yourself for once! [phone rings] [Drop sobs] [Roma] Let's go home, all of us, together. [phone rings] [Roma] I hated it. I hated it so much. I hated the hand that life had dealt Drop. I hated that we had no idea where we were going or what we were doing. But most of all, I hated that Drop even had a thought in his mind about just throwing away the time the three of us had spent together. [phone continues ringing] [intriguing music] [camera shutter clicks] [upbeat music] ♪ I got a story ♪ ♪ And I can't let go ♪ ♪ I'm sure we're past it ♪ ♪ My precious treasure ♪ [Roma] Finding our way back home was thankfully a lot easier. If only we hadn't gotten lost at the beginning. It was almost funny. We could have reached our goal a lot quicker. It took us about two whole days to finally find that lost drone. And in the end, it didn't have a single bit of evidence that could have helped prove our innocence. But... Look it. [both gasp] We got some amazing footage of the fireworks. So all those little specs down there have gotta be our town. Yeah, I think. That's really weird. It always seemed bigger to me. [dramatic rock music] [Toto] You wanna know something else that's really weird? [Roma] What? [Toto] Apparently, there's not supposed to be any bears out in those mountains. - Oh? - Yeah, it said so online. We saw one and didn't even get a picture. [snickers] Well, I guess that's life, huh? But we definitely saw a bear out there when we took that huge detour. And since we were the only ones who went on that path, we're the only ones that'll ever know. [chuckles] Oh, well. - Bottoms up! - [Toto] Ow. Watch it. Next time, you're gonna be the one buying. Mark my words. Okay, that sounds good to me. [soda can hisses] [Teacher] We need to exercise caution so the controlled burning doesn't lead to an even bigger wildfire. But as you can see, firefighters... [bullies snicker] [teacher continues indistinctly] [Roma sighs] Roma here. Do you read me? Over. Drop, if you're there, I got the photos. I just need to know where to take them to, over. Hang in there, over. Like a turnip. [bullies laugh] [gentle music] [Roma gasps] [students chatter] [Drop] The red's pretty, right? [Toto] Roma, hey. Can you hear me? Are you okay? Hello? Roma! [Roma] Deep down, I really thought I'd see him again. Because those days we spent together made me feel like our summer would never end. But the harsh truth is that sometimes people can just suddenly die. [melancholic music] [Roma grunts and screams] [no audio] [Roma grunting] [no audio] - [crashing] - [Roma grunting] [screams] It's not true, it's not true, it's not true! I don't believe it! Lies! Lies! [both panting] [sobs] [Roma] I didn't have a clue. Not really. [wailing] Neither of us did, not a clue. [somber music] [Roma] When did Drop even have a chance to come here? [Toto] I don't know. [sobs] Why did he have to be the last one to treat us? We were supposed to compete the next time. [Roma] I don't know. [Toto] There's nothing we could have done unless maybe we were doctors. But even then, no matter how hard we wanna save somebody's life, there's nothing we could have done, nothing. - Toto, drink the rest. - What? Come on, hurry! [coughs] What for? [Roma] Look.

One end of the world map to another, right? I don't see this waterfall he told us about. It's getting late. We should probably go back to camp. - [water rumbles] - Wait a sec. [Toto] Huh? [Roma] You hear that? Sounds like rumbling. [bird squawking] [Roma gasps] [soft music] [bird squawking] [waterfall rumbles] [birds squawking] [giggles] [chuckles nervously] [Roma and Toto laugh] [Roma] Is this really it? This is the golden waterfall? [Toto] It could be. [Roma] It's freaking gigantic. [Toto] You said it. It's way too big to fit in a single photo. [music continues] - [phone rings] - [both gasp] No way! [both grunting] Hurry up, come on! - Go, go, go! - I'm going, I'm going! [both grunt] - [ringing continues] - They're gonna hang up! I'm going as fast as I can! Would you hurry! It won't open! [both grunt] [thudding] [Roma] I'm coming, I'm coming! Hello, hello? Moshi moshi? Hello? I am Japanese. Hello? They hung up. I can't believe it. That was insane. I've only ever seen old phones like this in movies and stuff. Who was that? Where did they even get the number to call this place? [Roma and Toto] There! [gentle music] [Toto] But this'll be your last act of bravery as a 15-year-old and I wanna be right next to you to see it. If you believe in yourself, you'll finally get what you want for once. [Roma] Toto, the code for Ireland isn't 354. It's the code for Iceland. Well, too bad, 'cause I gotta go to cram school. 212. [phone rings] [phone ringing] No answer. Then we're gonna wake her up! [Toto] Hey, you were the one who wanted her number in the first place. [phone ringing] [Drop] Hello? Are you kidding? Did I... get it wrong? [Roma sobs] I must be losing it. Is this really happening? We reached him all the way out here. It was him on the other end of that call here in this booth. [laughs] It was all because your handwriting was so messy. [laughs] Roma, wait. Let's say, let's say, hypothetically, our call actually reached him. Then the call just now, who was it? [gentle music] [Roma] Who knows? [upbeat dramatic music] [Roma] If you build up some courage and take a leap, you can see things you never could before.
