I just got the bastard down! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Let him rest! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I want a meeting! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What about? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The cocky. Right. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What about him? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}He's driving us up the wall. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Hey, cut it out!

Heh. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}If it'd been for the fuckin' cocky, youd've done it! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Yeah, well, too right. But then I'd known I'd get paid for it. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}But don't worry, he won't feel no bumps. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Hey! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Now if I hear, that on the way into town, Old Garth found his way into the back again, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I'll come looking for you. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Right!? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I remember walkin' away from the orphanage every Saturday. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Every Saturday down the railway line. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The line took me to town. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I remember when I was twenty, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}in Brisbane, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}down from the shearing, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}going into the bar of the toughest pub, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}and the toughest man in the bar, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Jacky Sorehnson, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}huh, big bloke Jacky, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}wharfy, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}sent me over a beer. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}And he gave me a nod of respect, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}and I was twenty. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}and a shearer. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I was a gun shearer. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Last day, thank Christ. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Yeah. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}just out of here any day now. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Hey! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You been here all night? Na. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Got here early. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Couldn't sleep. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Bloody room too hot. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Be in town tonight! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}With a bit of luck. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You better pull your socks up boy. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Or stop muckin' about. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Haven't you been trying? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Oh, you cunning prick! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What's this then? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I dunno. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What's this? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You know I saw a bloke do this once, in a shed in Victoria. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Well I've never seen it, and I'm not sure it's allowed. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Oh well, it's allowed in Victoria. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What's the idea of it? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Oh, the idea is he doesn't have to switch off between sheep. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The cookin' oil stops it from burning out. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}That wouldn't save you much. Save you some. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Well, 'spose we could have a meeting about it. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}See if it's allowed. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I don't give a stuff. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Sure? No trouble to hold a meeting. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Nah! Stuff it! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Hey, I've got some news for you blokes. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Tim tells me the court's just ruled on the prosperity bonus. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}And... {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}We've lost it. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Better hang on to your pennies, I think there's going to be a bit of strife. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Any shed in the last ten years, if I was there, nobody beat me. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}'S right. Any shed in the last ten years... {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}...shed in the last ten years... {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}if I was there, nobody beat me. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}'S right, every shed in the last ten years. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}'S right...ten years... {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Sheep-o {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I'm faster on cross breeds. So am I mate. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}It's yours, it's yours. Right. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Sevens for me. Sevens. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}On the over....Sevens...Sevens {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You bastard! (shouting) {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Pay over, pay over.. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Yeah, go! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}All right. No more bets. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Forget it! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Place your bets, place you bets. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Stupid poop. How much did you lose? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The lot. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You know we're...odds on to strike, don't you? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}How much did you lose? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Oh, only a couple a hundred. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Listen, Tim's getting a bit wobbly round the knees about all this. He reckons we should cop what the court says. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Otherwise they'll bring in scab labour. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}There's been trouble up north already. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}What do you think? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I don't. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}All I know is here I am again, with the arse out of me tweeds, {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Why don't you ask your mate, Black Arthur? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}He's gone. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}And I'm going too. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You know where I'm going? Back to the fish market. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Now why don't you piss off, and annoy some other bugger {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Hello Foley! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Franky Davis, remember? {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I hear you got done. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Now we'd appreciate it if you all went back where you came from. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I'd hate you to think you got us out numbered. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The town's chocablock full of stinkin' shearers, on strike! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}We're just the welcoming committee. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}You're scabs! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}That's what you are. You're the lowest form of life. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Well, that was piss weak. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}We got company! {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Beer for thirty, there abouts. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Stuff 'em Ivy. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Don't wreck the place. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}I don't serve scabs. {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The Sundays of my life, are all the life I own {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}When Monday is too close for me to care {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Another view was green and another road was longer {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}and friends always waiting somewhere {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}The roads I didn't take, I bid them all so long {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}While Sunday warms my blood and cools my mind {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}And the dreams I thought were true are now mud beneath my foot prints {\a2}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\fnTahoma}Ten thousand ages behind...
