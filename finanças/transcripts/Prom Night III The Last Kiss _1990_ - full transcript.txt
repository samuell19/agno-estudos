Kill the lights and the sirens. [ Static On Mike ] I thought it would be a nice idea if we surprised him. And approach this kid with caution. He's already killed four people. And I want him alive. [ Static ] Although frankly, I don't know if I'm feeling all that picky tonight. [ Mary Lou ] Alex? You stay away from my family. Where are you goin', Alex? [ Rapid Breathing ] Alex? [ Chuckling ] Oh, Alex. I want you. Are you looking for me? [ Laughing ] Alex. [ Panting ] Keep walking, Alex. - Alex. [ Laughing ] - [ Gasping ] In other news, Alex Grey announced today... that he will wed his high school sweetheart, Mary Lou Maloney... after a whirlwind courtship that left hundreds of people talking... and four people dead.

[ Crying ] You won't get away with this! - [ Static ] - [ TV Chatter, Indistinct ] Workers digging on the football field at Hamilton High School... made a grisly discovery late yesterday afternoon-- - [ Static ] - A funeral was held today for Shane Taylor... the young Hamilton High School student that was brutally murdered by his best friend. - [ Static ] - Alex Grey, the so-called high school assassin... made a brief court appearance today, and was remanded in custody... to be held without bail until trial. Experts agree his psychotic killing spree could be the result... of bad dietary habits, rock and roll lyrics, and too many horror movies. - [ Static ] - Principal Weatherall, did you have any idea at all that there was something wrong with Alex? Oh, I certainly did! Alex Grey was a walking time bomb. A maniac. [ All Yelling ] It's a wonder he didn't snap earlier. I tried to warn people, but no one would listen. Will you be canceling the dance here tonight? Oh, this is not just a dance. This is the inaugural prom for our new gym. Now, this is a tragedy, but it's-it's also an isolated incident. And I won't allow the actions of a single, homicidal student... to ruin the fun of others. No, at Hamilton High it's prom night. [ Students Cheering ] [ Clicks Off ] You've heard enough about this. It's not true. Alex couldn't hurt anybody. Honey, mental illness is a terrible thing. It can stay hidden for years and then-- Bang! Who knows what sets them off? [ Scoffs ] You remember what happened to your father. [ Gasps ] How about baking some cookies? [ Sighs ] If I could just see him! They won't even let me talk to him. That nice boy Leonard called again. He still wants to take you to the prom. Mom! I can't go to the prom now! You have to forget about him and move on. We'll go downtown right now and get you a new dress. Maybe Elaine at the salon can fit you in. Mother! You're going to the prom, Sarah. That's an order. [ Clinking, Rattling ] [ Keys Rattling ] Is anybody out there? Guess who. Get away from me. Help! Oh, no! Help! Guard! She's down here! I can't believe that you're doing this to me.

She's not a woman. She's a demon. Aren't they all? [ Sighs ] You're not having a very good time. That's all right. I mean, I had another date one time, and she didn't have a good time either. Somehow we fell seven minutes behind schedule, and the whole evening-- Leonard, stop. It's nothing personal. If it's any consolation, I don't think Alex killed those people. It isn't. Thank you. I mean, [ Scoffs ] Alex isn't stupid enough to bury them in the football field. I'll be right back. Oh! Yeah. Um, I'll be right here. Oh, good. [ Whirring ] [ Gasps ] [ Exhales ] Oh, wow! Awesome.
