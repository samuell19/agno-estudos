Because I know they've got some pretty big cock here in New York City. Welcome to the Monster Ball. Now dance, you motherfuckers! Put your paws up. Now jump. My... ...name... ...is... ...Lady Gaga! And welcome... ...to the last... ...of five shows... ...at Madison Square Garden. I feel so blessed. You have no idea. I grew up 2O blocks from here... ...and I watched every name go up on that marquee... ...year after year, month after month. And I used to dream that one day I'd see my name in lights. So thank you so much. Thank you for buying a ticket to see my show. And for those of you who didn't pay for your tickets... ...I want my money back. I'm just kidding. You know, I didn't used to be brave. In fact, I wasn't very brave at all. But you have made me brave, little monsters. And New York made me brave. So now... ...l'm gonna be brave for you. Tonight I want you to forget all of your insecurities. I want you to reject anyone or anything... ...that's ever made you feel like you don't belong or don't fit in. Or made you feel like you're not good enough... ...or pretty enough, or thin enough. Or can't sing well enough, or dance well enough... ...or write a song well enough. Or like you'll never win a Grammy. Or you'll never sell out Madison Square Garden! You just remember that you're a goddamn superstar! And you were born this way! May tonight be your liberation of all those things. Because I used to pick up my leather boots... ...on that street... ...and I would go down the stairs... ...to the 9 Train. And I'd take the 9 Train downtown. And then I'd get on the L Train to go across town. And I'd go to dance class. And I would pray, and I would dream... ...that someday, one person would believe in me. So when you leave here tonight... ...know that at least one person believes in you. Hello, purple unicorn. That is the most fabulous gay unicorn that I have ever seen. He has a rainbow horn. He's purple. He has neon hooves. That's very exciting. The only thing better than a unicorn is a gay unicorn. Oh, you know what that means. All the New York gays Came out to play And some came from New Jersey But we don't care 'Cause it's all the same And we were born this way Yeah! I don't know what I'm gonna do with all of you. You see, I told my friends about the Monster Ball. I told them that the Monster Ball would set them free. So we got into my car... ...but my car broke down in Brooklyn. So then we got onto the subway... ...onto the F Train... ...which always gets me where I need to go. But the subway's left us off in this very strange place. And I just have no fucking clue where we are. You think I should ask my friends for some help? You know, my deepest and most loyal friends? You know... ...all my New York and tristate-area gays? This one's for the boys and the girls tonight. Celebrate your gay pride.

This is so crazy for me, just completely psycho. I used to sit usually in the bleachers, you know, in the back. And I would sit with my mom, you know, who would take me to see shows. And I'd watch some other bitch sing and dance on the stage all night... ...that I wanted to be. And I would say, "I wish I was that bitch on that stage." So just so you know... ...someday you'll be up here instead of me... ...and I'll be sitting in the back cheering all you guys on. Hello? Beyonc?? She's always interrupting the middle of my show.

And it's just this really amazing night for all of us. And I'm so happy. I can't even begin to tell you... ...how grateful I am that you're all here. And it's really funny... ...because my favorite thing about the Monster Ball... ...is that everybody gets really drunk... ...and vomits on each other and has a good time. So you don't know this... ...but in between the sets when the videos are playing... ...I can actually see you from backstage. And I see everybody running to go get drinks really quickly. I'm always laughing because I think, "These drunk assholes. That's all they wanna do, is drink and have a good time." So in light of watching all of you have a good time... ...I would like to dedicate this song to all the drunk assholes in my life. This is called "Speechless." Oh, I I can't believe what you said to me Last night we were alone You threw your hands up Baby, you gave up, you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me With your James Dean glossy eyes Oh, in your tight jeans with your long hair And your cigarette-stained lies Could we fix you if you broke? Was your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again Oh, boy, you've left me speechless You've left me speechless So speechless And I'll never love again Oh, friends, you've left me speechless You've left me speechless So speechless And my make... Every night, this fucking makeup falls off right at that same lyric. Shit. And on another note... ...not to blow up too many people's spots tonight, but Liza Minnelli is here. I thought you all might want to stand up for her... ...because, you know, it is Liza. And Marisa Tomei is here tonight. And I usually would never tell you guys who's here tonight... ...but the reason I'm telling you... ...is because these two women influenced me so much... ...when I was in theater school. Because I went to Tisch, you know, at NYU. And what used to happen was the teachers would go: "Well, your voice is too pop. And when you sing pop music, your voice is too theater. And, you know... ...you're never gonna play the heroine. And you're never gonna play the blond, you know. You're never gonna play the ing?nue. You'll never be the main character. You're never gonna be the star. Because you have dark hair and you're too ethnic." So I used to say: "Well, what about Liza?" And then I'd get to acting class... ...and they'd always pull out a script for me... ...that Marisa had played in a movie... And they'd say, "You'll play these kinds of... These kinds of really ballsy women roles." And you know what? There's never a role other than that... ...that I'm ever gonna wanna play. So thank you, Marisa, for always playing that role for us. After all the drinks And the bars that we've been to Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you? After all the boys and the girls That we've been through Would you give it all up? I've never given up If I promise, boy, to you Well, I'll never talk again, no Oh, I'll never love again Oh, I'll never write a song Won't even sing along Why you so speechless? Speechless Speechless So thank you for giving me... ...two bad bitches to look up to. So speechless, baby All right, you wanna hear a new one? This is from my new album, Born This Way. This is called "Yo? and I." It's been a long time Since I came around Been a long time But I'm back in town And this time I'm not leaving without you You taste like whiskey When you kiss me, oh I'd give anything again To be your baby doll This time I'm not leaving without you He says sit back down Where you belong In the corner of my bar With your high heels on Sit back down on the couch Where we made love the first time And you said to me Something, something about This place Something about lonely nights And my lipstick on your face Something, something about My cool Nebraska guy Yeah, something about, baby, you and I It's been two years Since I let you go Couldn't listen to a joke Or rock 'n' roll Muscle cars drove a truck Right through my heart On my birthday you sang me "A Heart of Gold" With the guitar humming In overload This time I'm not leaving Without you Oh, oh Sit back down Where you belong In the corner of a bar With your high heels on Sit back down on the couch Where we made love the first time And you said to me There's something Something about this place Something about lonely nights And my lipstick on your face Something, something about My cool Nebraska guy Yeah, something about New York, you and I Put your hands up.
