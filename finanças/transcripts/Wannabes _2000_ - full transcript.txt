[train running] [loud punches] [groans] No! [coughing] Do you know who I am? Yeah. Santo Minieri's son. That's the wrong fucking answer. -You got him? -I got him. I'm Vinny Minieri. And don't you fucking forget it. [screams] ["I Wanna Be Somebody"] [kids chatting] Oh, yeah! [cheering] [Paulie] Everyone wants to be somebody. Especially in my neighborhood. Me, my brother Angelo and my friends were just trying to make ends meet. We're still trying to figure out what we wanted to do. For now, we were just having fun on the same streets that we grew up on. Come on, Paulie! Come on! Let's go, baby. Come on!. Come on, Paulie. [crowd chanting] Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! [whistling] Come on. Get it! Get it! -Alright. That's an out. -Shit! That's two, baby. One more, and you're done! "Now batting: Derek Jeater." Derek Jeater just got about 200 pounds heavier. -Fuck you, Freddie. -Come on, Pete. Just pitch the ball already. -Alright, Pete. -Come on, Pete. Yeah, Pete! Stay at second. Stay! Stay! Yeah, Pete! Alright, Tie runs on second. Come on, Ang. You're the winning run. Let's go! Let's go! -Come on, Ang. -Mike Piazza steps up. -Piazza's a righty. -Well, today, he's a lefty. Bring me in, Ang! [cheering] -Come on, Pete! Run! -Go, Pete! Go! [cheering] Shit! Tie game, let's go. Tie game my ass! We win. I beat that throw. Hey, fuck you, you jerk off. You fucking cheating cock sucker! Yeah, go back to Bay Ridge, you fucking losers. -Your mother's a-- -My mother's a loser? I'll bust your fucking head open. [yelling] What are you doing? What are you nuts? Keep that bat. Aren't you neighborhood kids? [all] Yeah. "Yeah?" Well, neighborhood kids shouldn't fight with one another. If you want to fight, I'm sure Eddie here would love to accommodate you. I thought not. This is my neighborhood. Do I make myself clear? -[all] Yes, sir. -Yes, Mr. Minieri. Alright. Give them back their bat. You kids look a little old to be playing stick ball. You alright, Fred? I think your broke my fucking rib. Come on, give us the money. Hand over the money. -Hand it over, come on. -Give us the money. You happy with your 20 dollars each? Yeah. Better in our pockets than yours. -Hey, he was out. -Double or nothing next time. -He was out. He was out! -I don't want to hear it. Now, I got cigarette money. Hey, come on, Ang. We got to go home and get ready for work. Yeah, I know. I'm real fucking excited about it. [Dom] I got to go to work, too. I've got kids that want ice cream. Hey, hey, hey. Watch this. Watch this. Hey, Dom. Give me a chocolate éclair, will you? No chocolate éclairs today, fat boy. Fuck you, you half assed-- Hey, Dom. You have any Italian ice in there? Italian ice is all sold. Yeah. What kind of ice cream man are you? I'm a little light today, okay? You're always fucking light. Come on, cheapskate. Give us some ice cream. -You guys are ball busters. -Come on, give it. Give it. -Let's go. -Busting my balls. He's always holding out. [laughs] I don't like ice cream sandwiches. What do you want from me? I'll take it. I love ice cream sandwiches. Know what Italian ice is, Dom? -Paulie, get out of here. -Come on. -Don't choke on those. -See you. Wow. Did you see that car Santo had? What's the difference? He's eaten in the restaurant at least a hundred times. He don't even know who the fuck we are. Ang, neither of us had ever had his section. Working there over two years. Think the guy would at least recognize us. We're waiters, Ang. Come on, who notices waiters? One day, he'll know our faces. Right. God, I hope it's me. I bet he's a good tipper. Get in that way, moron. [calm music] Alright, here we go. Shrimp for the lady. Why were you staring at the waiter? You know him? What are you talking about? No, I don't know him. Well, you were looking at him. Here we go again. Oh, that's it. We're leaving. -Bobby, let's go. -But the food! I don't give a shit. We're leaving. Right. You're lucky I don't kick your ass, alright? What's the problem? I don't know, sir. They just walked out. They--Good evening, sir. They just walked out? I know they walked out. They also didn't pay for their appetizers. The guy said you were flirting with his girlfriend. -Oh, that's bullshit. -Hey, watch your mouth. Alright? Happens again, you're out of here. Now, come on. Clear off these tables. What's the matter? Some asshole just accused me of flirting with his girlfriend. -Were you? -No! She slipped me her phone number, though. -You going to call her? -Yeah! She was hot! Yo, her name is Tammy. I thought you weren't flirting? Oh, Tammy? Well... You can look her up in the phonebook under 'T'. You find this funny, "Mr. Ha?" What is this, a brother's convention or something? Alphonse and Gaston, let's go! We got customers waiting out there. Guess you ain't calling her. Can I get you guys anything else? Yeah, you can heat up this bread. Okay. Son of a bitch. -I've seen that. -Yeah, like you don't do it. I do much worse and I get a ballbreaker. One time, I peed in a guy's coke. -What? -Yeah, I mean it. He wouldn't stop breaking my balls, so I put a little bit of urine in the glass before I poured the coke. He didn't know? Oh, if you put a little bit in, you can get away with it. Mario, Victor's waiting for you outside. Right on time. Like fucking clock work, this guy. Your bookie again? This is the third week in a row me and my friends lost. We're going to make that son of a bitch a rich man. So why don't you quite betting? Yeah, right. As soon as I stop breathing. You know, I hate doing business with that prick, but you know what they say? It's the only game in town. Oh, you're not going to believe who's sitting in your section. -Who? -Santo and Carmine. -You're kidding me. -Go see for yourself. This bread better be hot. It's real hot. What can I get for you guys? Hey. It's the kid from the stick ball game. You still swinging that stick ball bat? We love to play. Not many kids play stick ball anymore. I love the old school stuff. Stick ball, Skully. Even play stoop ball sometimes. Skully's a good game. Play with a bottle cap, nice. -Good game. -And stoop ball? Remember stoop ball? Can we eat now? What do you suggest? I suggest anything you guys want. Because it's on the house. [laughs] You've never seen us eat and drink, kid. I don't think your boss is going to like you giving us food on the house. He ain't going to know. How do you like this kid? It's busy tonight. We'll just slip the food by. Leave it to me. I'll take good care of you guys. What's your name? Angelo, Mr. Minieri. Angelo. This is Carmine. This is Pino, this here, Rosetti. Oh, but you've already met him. I won't forget him. I'll bring all the appetizers for now. Nice bottle of Moet. -Sounds good. -Hey, Dad. Vinny! Angelo, this is my son, Vinny. You going to eat? Yeah, me and Elaine were going to sit down. He can sit in my brother's section, Mr. Minieri. -My brother will take good-- -Don't tell me where to sit. -I was trying-- -Keep your mouth shut before I give you a back slap. Angelo. Just get the food. Sorry. Vinny. Vinny! Go sit down. I can't believe you slipped that check by Mr. Letto. Fuck him! Do you feel like you have to impress these guys, Ang? I'm telling you, you're going to get us fired. I don't plan on making a career out of being a waiter, Paulie. Well, neither do I, Ang. But the restaurant's paying our bills. And if we don't pay the bills, we're going to be out on the street. Don't you get it, Paulie? I want to be the one sitting down with a nice looking broad. Or somebody serves me. I do, too, Ang. But for right now, we got to do what we got to do. What did we say, huh? We said this was going to be our year. A new millennium. Big things were going to happen for us. Hopefully, they will. You just got to be more patient. I've been patient my whole life, Paulie. So they at least take care of you? Hell, yeah. Some fucking tip they left. What about that Santos son? -Take care of you? -No. Fucking piece of shit left five dollars on 130 dollar check, What a jerk off. Only gets respect because of his dad. It'd be nice to have a dad all powerful like that. It'd be nice to have a dad home period. [dance music] ...I saw him yesterday. And here are your drinks. That will be 20 dollars, please. To success. Yeah, sure it will come soon. Hey, Vinny. How are you? -How are you doing? -Great. How are you doing? -Vinny! Hey! -Baby. Oh, shit. Look who it is. That's Santos' son, right? See what power does? I bet his dad got a piece of that joint. Oh, look at those big titties. I love big titties. Too big, though, right? Look at me, look at her. Who's big? She'll fucking suffocate you with those things. Come on, baby. Come to papa! [chatting] Who's fucking clowning around. -Hey, hey! -How are you guys doing? -Doing alright, baby. -Hey. How are you? We're fine. Can we sit with you guys? Sit down. Yeah, I think so. [woman] Are you guys Italian? [Paulie] Yeah. What gave it away? I don't know. We can tell. We like Italian guys. -You girls want a drink? -Sure. -You like Moet? -Yeah, we love Moet. Waitress. Send over a bottle of Moet. So, uh, you girls been working here a long time? Uh, about a year. But, uh... I've never seen you two guys here before. You know, we're busy. Busy doing what? Well, traveling. Doing a couple of businesses. Always on the move. That's nice. Thank you very much. Your welcome 90 dollars, please. No problem. -Salute, girls. -I love Moet. -[Pete] Hey, Ang. -Salute. -What about us? -What, nothing? You guys don't like Moet. Eh. Yeah, we hate Moet. Look at the freaking cans on this broad, would you? Hey, Pete. I'm, uh, I love the ass. I'm not really a tit guy. Come on. How'd you like to get her in the back of that ice cream truck? Yeah, I'd give her one of my fucking ice pops. -Ooh, that sounds good to me. -Me, too. [man] Come on, girls. Let's dance. In a few minutes. We want to dance now. Relax, buddy. Come on, girls. You're going to do a lot better with me and my friends than these guys. You a fucking asshole? Go home and watch the Sopranos, you dumb guido. [screaming] Get the fuck off! Get your hands off me. Get your fucking hands off me! Hey, wait a minute! What the fuck is wrong with you assholes? They started with us. I don't give a fuck! This place is affiliated with me. If anybody is going to hit somebody in here, it's going to be me. Wait a minute. You two are waiters from Monty's on Cobble Street, aren't you? Yeah. So go wait on some fucking tables. I catch you here again, you'll be sorry! Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out. What is this, you talking to a fucking wall? Get your fucking hands off me. Get the fuck out of here. How can you sit there and try and sleep? After that scumbag talked to us like that? We got to sit there and eat it! There's nothing you can do about it, Ang. A spent a hundred bucks on that bottle of Moet. We didn't even get to fucking drink it. I know you did. You're just trying to impress people again. I don't need your shit right now. When are you going to accept who you are? Fuck you, Paulie. Where the hell is your brother? He's late. -He should be here any minute. -Well, he better get his ass in here. There are people out there who requested him as a waiter. Very important people if you know what I mean. Yeah. I need those peppers. Andiamo, andiamo! Oh, no. Too much! Oh! Alfredo! Alfredo, you are killing me with these portions! Please leave some room for desert. Oh. Oh, my... [calm music] [coughs] -You okay? -You alright? You got to cut down on the smoking. Yeah, as soon as you take up jogging. -Hey, kid. -Yeah? -Where's Angelo? -I'm very sorry, Mr. Minieri. He's a little bit late. I'm going to start you guys off with your appetizers, alright? It's about time you showed up. I'm in no mood for your shit. Hey, who do you think you're talking to? I'm your boss. Don't forget that. -You ain't my boss. -Hey, I heard that, young man. With that kind of attitude, Your skating on some very thin ice here, mister. And don't think for a moment I don't know what you did with that check the other night. Oh, guess who's paycheck that's coming out of? No wonder they requested you. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yeah. I don't know which of the two of you is worse. Oh, Angelo. I'm so sorry to keep you guys waiting. How are you guys doing tonight? I think the question is, uh, how are you doing? I had better days. And boss likes to break my balls. Want me to straighten him out? No, no. That's okay. I can handle him. Well, that's right. You can handle him. Maybe you can just, uh, bust a bottle over his head like you did in my joint last night. I meant no disrespect, Mr. Minieri. I'm really, really sorry about that. Some fucking yuppie called me a guido and told me to go home and watch the Sopranos. Well, you know what? Then maybe, you should cut his balls off. You know, so he can sing like a soprano? [laughs] Hey, I'm hungry, kid. -Get us something. -I'll bring out a load of food right now, Mr. Minieri. Right away. -Vinny. -Hi, Dad. How you doing, Eddie? Hey, Vinny. -You eating here? -Yeah. Oh, good. Angelo. That's your section over there, right? Yes, Mr. Minieri. Good. Vinny. Go sit over there. Angelo would take good care of you. You better take care of me. After that shit he pulled last night. Angelo. You don't mind taking care of my son, do you? Not at all. I'll be right back, Mr. Minieri. What can I get for you guys? What can you get for us? You can get us the same thing you get my father. We're no different over here. Okay. And while you're at it, get us a big pitcher of soda, too. No problem. Can you believe this guy? Fuck him. What's with the "no problem?" I don't know. He's a fucking joke. You know something? I'm glad you got stuck with that prick's table. That's alright. I'll fix his ass. [urinating] Oh, Ang! Are you fucking nuts? What, do you want to get us killed, Ang? What are you doing? Steal my idea? Fuck him. Ang, do you have any idea who you're doing that to? -Why? Who's he giving that to? -Vinny. Vinny Minieri? Santo Minieri's son? What are you nuts? Ang, when I did it, I did it to a six-year old Jew with no connections. You're doing it to a wise guy's kid! I don't give a fuck. He's an asshole. Ang, come on. I don't think this is such a good idea. I mean, come-- So did you bet tonight, Mario? Yeah. I got two grand on the Yankees. It's about fucking time! I'm dying of thirst over here. [pouring] Enjoy your soda, fellas. But do these assholes know that they're drinking piss? Oh, we're dead. This is fucking good soda. They probably put a little seven up in it. Uh, excuse me. What is this, a lawn party, huh? You want an arm chair and a foot rest? Dumb and dumber, like the movie. You're both a couple of fucking morons. Andiamo! Look at the abuse this kid's taking. I'll bet you 100 dollars the kid don't lay down. [Letto] I'm surprised at you, Paulie. You had such promise! Your worse than him. You're getting worse than your brother! [yells] Shit! Talk to him like that again, and I'll bury you. Come on, Paulie. Wait on the tables yourself. You think it's funny? Guess we lost our waiters. It looks like Letto might need a drink now. I don't blame them. [laughing] Hey, Letto! Who's your dealer? Hey! What the hell is wrong with you? You fucking cracking up lately. I ain't taking shit from nobody. That Vinny treats us like garbage. And Mr. Letto? He had it coming to him. Two years we put up with this shit. Yeah, well, you just put an end to that, Ang. Because now, we don't have a fucking job! We'll be lucky if we can get a job as waiters after what you did! I ain't going back to no waiter job. -I got an idea. -Oh, no. Look, Ang. I'm sick of your crazy ideas. It's a good one. Oh, yeah? Okay. What is it? Not now. I'm tired. I'll tell you tomorrow with the guys. Can you believe that thing's still running? [laughing] What the hell happened to you? What happened to me? The fucking air conditioner in there, that's what happens to me. How do you drive that piece of shit? Don't start, Dom. At least I got a car. What do you do? You ride around that piece of shit ice cream truck? Pull up to a girl's house at night, ring your little jingle bell? -Fuck you please. -Knock it off. I called you here for a reason. Doesn't it make you sick to see three pieces of shit out there? We need to change, guys. There should be lexes out there. Beamers. Fucking Benz. At least you got a Lincoln, Ang. Yeah, a 1985 Lincoln. Like a fucking hanger from an antennae. We've got to start making some moves, guys. To make some serious money. What moves, Ang? Fellas, we're going into the bookie business. Where are you going? I'm going into the city to get a job. -Sit down, Paulie. -For what? To listen to another one of your crazy ideas? Come on. Why do you want to become bookies, Ang? With what customers, huh? With what bank roll? Yeah, Ang. How are we going to pay people if they win? All we need to start up in this business is 20 grand. Twenty grand? We're lucky we got 20 bucks in our pocket. Listen. I'm going to go speak to my Uncle Tommy. See if he'll lend me and Paulie our share. You two could scrape up five grand a piece. Do you really think Uncle Tommy's going to give us -any more money? -Yeah, I do. You're fucking crazy. What about customers, Ang? We don't even have any. Pete, getting customers is the easy part. How many gamblers do we know? Huh? We can get Mario and all his friends. You guys know a lot of people. What if they win the whole bank roll? How many gamblers win? Mario and his friends work to pay the bookie, Better us than him. This could be a good idea you know. Alright, count me in. I'll come up with the money. Me, too. Okay, fine. We'll give it a try. But I doubt Uncle Tommy's going to give us anything. We're his only nephews. Are you not nuts? Why would you want to borrow 10 grand? I told you, Uncle Tommy! We want to go into business. Yeah? What business is this? We want to buy a hot dog stand. You want to open up a hot dog stand? You're going to sell hot dogs on the corner, huh? Ang, you can do better than that. Alright. Alright, I'll tell you. We're going into the bookie business. Are you nuts? The bookie business? Bookies make good money. Do you realize what kind of people you got to deal with to become a bookie? People you don't want to be associated with. I really don't need a lecture right now, Uncle Tommy. What I need is 10 grand. Come on. We'll pay you back. What you need is to stand on your own two feet. That's what you need. And you need to get into something that's not going to get you in trouble. Yeah, like what? Wait on tables? I ain't doing that shit no more! I told you, you could come work for me. What's wrong with that? I don't want to do construction. It's good for now, huh? Look, Uncle Tommy. I feel real good about this bookie business. Please help us out over here. No, I can't. Not for something like this. I won't. You know what? We don't need your help. Come on, Paulie. Let's get out of here. Listen, Paulie. I mean, you know how I feel about you kids. I love you guys, right? I love your brother, but he's got a thick head. And sometimes, he doesn't think. Now, I want you to get away from this idea of a bookie business. It's only going to get you in trouble, sweetheart. Alright? Trust me. Take care, Uncle Tommy. Bye. Watch out for your brother. [Bruno] Twenty grand? I ain't lending you guys twenty grand. Why not, Bruno? We'll pay you back. Who the fuck are you I'm going to lend you twenty grand anyway? Now what you think's going to happen if you can't pay me back? Huh? You guys got no collateral. You got nothing. What do you got? What do you got anyway? A couple of beat up cars and that broken down fucking ice cream truck? Now, you. Ice cream guy. My kid brought a cake to him the other day for a chip wish, and what'd you tell him? "We don't have one." Then he asked you for five other things. Five! And what'd you say? "We don't have that either!" What kind of fucking business are you running anyway? You want to borrow 20 grand. What are you? A fucking comedian? I wouldn't give you 20 cents. Get a job, rob a bank. Hord a money store. Do something. Cock sucker. Everybody thinks we're a fucking joke. We're going to get this money one way or another. Forget it. We're going to have to go into the city and get some new jobs. No way. Ain't going back to know bullshit job. Oh, yeah? Well, you're going to have to unless you want to live on the street Ang. I got it. Carlos the bus boy. Told me his cousin is a loan shark. He'll lend us the money. Get in touch with that guy. Holy shit. What? That's the girl from the restaurant. Thank you. How you doing? Oh, look who it is. The guy who never called me. I wanted to, I swear. But my boss ripped up your phone number. Yeah, right. He did. He did, I swear to god. He did it right in front of me. Is that why you're not working there anymore? How did you know I wasn't working there anymore? I happened to go there last night to eat with my friend and I noticed that you weren't there. Well, yeah. That's why I quit. Because he ripped up your phone number. You're such a bad liar, Paulie. Are you still dating that guy from the restaurant? No! Way to possessive. Oh, that's no good. He can't have that. Why don't you grab a pizza and come eat with me and my-- No, I got to go. I got class. -You go to school? -Acting class. Oh, wow. Well, you're definitely pretty enough to be an actress. Trying. Okay. I am going to give you my number one more time. If you lose it, you can forget it, okay? Guard it with my life this time. Okay. Thank you. Your welcome. [mutters] -Have fun in class. -Call me. -I will. -You better. Hey, pretty boy... Who do you think, I'm a pig like my brother? Did she see you in this shirt? What's with this shirt today? Will you stop making fun of my clothes already? We're going to Spanish Harlem to borrow money and you're making fun of my outfit. Hey, that's where you bought it, isn't it? Hey, fat boy. At least your car fits in the neighborhood. And these fuzzy dice, too? What's with these fuzzy dice? I bought them over at Zack's carwash in 86th street. I like them. -One eyed Zack? -One eyed Zack. -The guy with no teeth? -Yeah. I heard Johnny D Mark got them from that New York designer. You know what? These dice, not for us. -Fuck this! -Ang! Do you trust these guys? Oh, yeah? -So why are they late? -They'll be here. I'm counting on you, dude. [Pete] You're getting me another pair! [muttering] Look at these fucking people. Carlos, what's up? This is Hector. Hector, that's Angelo. What's up? SO you want 20 grand? Yeah. You guineas couldn't get twenty grand from your neighborhood? We could. Vig was a little high over there. I figured we'd shop around. Well, it's a little high over here, too. How high? -Six points. -Six points? Am I speaking Chinese? You know caprice? Six points on 20 grand is 1,200 a week, just the juice. Que pasa? You guys came all the way from... -to waste my time? -No. Huh? So you want it or what? Can you charge us four? [laughs] What the fuck this is? A used car lot? There ain't no bargaining. You know what, forget about it. No, no, no, no. We'll pay you six. -No problem. -No problem? No problem. You better have my vig every week. Or you Italians might end up cut up and dumped... Capisce? Six fucking points? The goal rate is three. That loan shark is some rocky. We should think about it one day. You know this is fucking crazy? This bookie business better be as good as you say it is. You know a pro bookie? [Paulie] So we started up the bookie business. Every gambler that we knew was calling us. Ang. Come here. You know our customers practically won every single bet they made last night? I know. Don't worry. Their luck's going to run out. [chatting] But things weren't going as planned. Our customers were winning night after night. You gonna bust my balls about this? I know! Goodbye! You see last night's scores? Yeah, I know, Paulie. You know? You know we lost our whole bank roll last night? And give grand on top of that, you know that? I know, Paulie. [phone ringing] Yeah? Yeah, I know you guys won a lot of money. Alright. I'll have it for you later. Alright. Who was on the phone? Mario. Mario? Mario, who we owe 16 grand to, that Mario? Ang, how did I let you talk me into this? Do you know we're out 25,000 dollars total right now? Where are we going to come up with five grand and the money we owe for the vig? People are going to come knocking on our doors, Ang. Don't worry about it. It's going to be alright. We'll come up with this money. Next week, they'll lose it all back. Next week? Ang, there's not going to be a next week, alright? We're sticking this out. [doorbell rings] -What's up, guys? -Hey. Did you see the scores? Oh, yeah. We saw the scores alright. We're in trouble, guys. We're not in trouble. I'm glad they won. Because they're going to lose about double. It's a known fact. The more you let it ride, the more you lose. Listen, guys. I've got a bad feeling about this. I think we should get out while we still can. You got 25 grand? No fucking way. What do you say we order pizza? Why the fuck didn't you listen to me? You go to a fucking loan shark? Huh? That's what you do? What the fuck is wrong with you anyway? If you would have lend us money in the first place, we wouldn't have went. Hey, don't blame his shit on me, alright? Please just help us this time, Uncle Tommy. These people are going to come looking for us. If you're lucky, they'll break your door down. That's what you should do. Not so easy, huh? Huh, Angelo? Always looks easy, but it's not. You and your big ideas about being a bookmaker. Guys are nothing but trouble. Trouble that I got to get you out of now. Alright. Just this once. I'm going to let you off the hook. But you better pay off that fucking loan shark. And if you get in trouble again, you're on your own. Get out of here, will you? Get out. [Paulie] So Uncle Tommy lent us five grand to pay all our customers and 1,200 to pay the vig. The Red Sox went to six. This was week two. The week my brother said we'd make back all the money. And believe it or not, he was right. Our customers were losing big time! Here. Hey, did you see these scores? They lost a bundle last night. I told you they couldn't keep winning. It's only going to get better. Forty thousand six hundred and fifty. Yeah, baby! Yeah! This definitely beats the ice cream business. You were right, Ang. They doubled up and they lost. Now, we have 15,000 dollars profit after we pay everybody back. How much did that Mario and his friends lose, Ang? They lost 23,000 dollars. And my customer Gino at the tattoo parlor, he lost another five grand. I hope all these people are going to other pay us. Of course they're going to pay us. We paid them all when they won. You know what? I'll call Mario now. Hey, Mario! How are you doing? Yeah, you-- What? What do you mean we've got a problem? All your friends ran away? Yeah, okay. Listen to me, Mario. I lent you 16 grand last week. What? Alright. You know what? You don't got to pay us. That mother fucker! What do you mean he isn't going to pay us? He said he ain't paying us. If we do anything to him, he's going to tell Vinny what I did in the restaurant. The restaurant? What'd he do in the restaurant, Paulie? Brain surgeon over here pissed in his coke. [laughs] You peed in Vinny Minieri's coke? Santo Minieri's son? Yeah. You're fucking crazy, bro. This is great. We pay people, and now they don't want to pau us. I don't know why I went along with this to begin with, Ang. You know we're fucked. We crow a crazy Spanish a lot of money. We owe Uncle Tommy money. We got to pay our fucking rent! And we don't have a dollar to our name. You really fucked up this time. I didn't fuck up anything. We got over 40 grand coming to us. We're going to get it. It's time to make amuck, fellas. That Mario be begging us to take his money. [tense music] [groans] [coughing] -Get up, you mutt! -Get him up! Get up you piece of shit. You going to pay us our fucking money, you fucking scumbag? Fuck you! Do him, Ang! Tough guy, huh? Go get our money. Get our money, Mario. You payed your other bookie. [speaking foreign] Get us our fucking money! I can't wait to tell Vinny what you did to him at the restaurant. This fucking piece of shit. [speaking foreign] I'm glad you said that. As a matter of fact, I hope you don't pay. So I can put a fucking hole in your head! You got three seconds! One, two! [Dom] Blow his fucking head off. Alright! Alright, okay! I'll pay. -Too fucking late! -Angelo! He said he's going to pay! GO get our fucking money! [loud punching] [glass shattering] Are you going to pull that trigger? What difference does it make? People are going to have to start treating us with respect, Paulie. I'm sick of us being nobodies. We're aren't nobodies, Ang. I'm not going to be no more. You'll see. The word's going to get around. [Paulie] The word did get around. And all our customers paid us. My brother was right. The bookie business was going good. And we were finally making money. Talk. What's going on? Come on! Focus, baby! Focus. Yeah, alright. Five, ten, sure. Half a million, what's going on? What's up there, buddy? We got the Patriots. Pete wanted us to meet his friend who wanted to do big business with us. Why don't you put a shirt on? I'm working on my tan here for the girls, you know? Listen to me. You sure these guys are good? [Pete] Yeah, they're good. They're a little weird, but they're good. Don't worry about it. [Angelo] What's with these birds? He loves birds. Harry! Harry! These are my friends. Angelo, Paulie, and Dominic. What's up? So you want to do business with us? Yeah, I know all the vendors in Coney Island. They all love to gamble. I'll throw all the action your way. 25 percent. Does that bird talk? What are you interested in his bird for? -We're talking business. -I want to hear him talk. Dominic, we're talking business here. Alright. We're going to give you a quarter sheet. You're responsible for the losses. We don't get paid, we're coming for you and your fucking bird. Don't worry. You'll get paid. Hello, birdy. Dominic. What's with this bird? -This is a macaw. -What the fuck's a macaw? This is a macaw. His name is Chico. He doesn't talk. Alright, listen. We're going to start up this week. Make sure we get paid. And put that shit out next time. Harry, do the right thing. [Chico] Fuck you! What did you say? -What did you say? -It wasn't me. -It was the bird! -The bird? The bird talks? I thought you said the bird doesn't talk. I was only kidding! Come on, Ang. Leave him alone. Actually, he loves to talk. -What's up, Chico? -Fuck you! That's all he knows. You're a fucking clown. Just make sure we get paid. ["I Wanna Be Somebody"] [Paulie] Angelo wanted us to expand. We started running numbers, loan sharking. We were even selling fireworks. And the money started rolling in. All the best. Hey, baby. I've got some business I got to take care of. We paid back Hector what we owed him. I brought you 20, plus the vig. I'm impressed. You guineas payed me back quick. How would you like it if I said I paid the spic back quick? -Hey, I don't mean any-- -From now on, you cut out that guinea bullshit. We're here to do business. Hey, you guys are alright. [Angelo] You're beautiful, too, Hector. We even paid back Uncle Tommy. It really did feel good to finally be on the other end of the table. It's all there. Told you we'd pay you back. Really big time, aren't you, Ang, huh? Big time. -What's up, guys. -Harry. Aren't you going to count it? You know I trust you, Harry. You need to do something with that bird, Harry. We'll see you next week. You fucking guys. You know, it feels real good to have a few extra bucks in my pocket. What good? This is great! I mean, you were right, Ang. The only way to make the big money is to make moves. I've got something else in mind for us to do. Oh, what now? Guy that took over Mr. Russo's store, the Arab. Another Arab took a news stand in our neighborhood? That's all they're going to get these days. Italians don't own newsstands no more. We're going to go in this joint, we're going to shake this guy down. -Extort him? -Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea at all. I mean, come on. We're lucky with what we got away so far, now you's want to extort people? I don't think this is good either, I mean, this is Santo's neighborhood, you know. Exactly. Yeah, Ang. This is definitely not a good idea. It's a great idea. One day, this neighborhood could be ours. Hey, kids! Stop messing with the magazines if you're not going to buy them! I can't believe Mr. Russo sold you this store! You fucking stink and you make this whole place stink! Get out of my store or I'll call the police! What the fuck was that, you smelly bastard? -Hugo! -What the fuck are you guys doing? -Get over here! -What's the matter with you? What's going on in here? These kids messed my magazines up, threw gum at me, and I'm calling the police. No, no, no. There's no need for you to call the police. We'll handle this. What the fuck is wrong with you? Man, fuck this camel jockey! This man ain't a camel jockey. He's got a name. -What's your name? -Singh! Singh. Look at me. Say you're sorry to Singh. I'm sorry, Singh. Next time you come back here, you show this man some respect. No problem, Angelo. -Now get out of here. -Beat it! Thank you. It's no problem. You don't need the police. We're the police in this neighborhood. Who are you guys? Consider us your protection. Protection? Yeah, your protection. It's kind of like accident insurance. We'll make sure you don't have any. And the cost? 300 a week. And 300 a week is nothing to a rich guy like you. What if I don't want to? Well, that's entirely up to you. But then we can't prevent any accidents from happening. Know what I'm saying? Oops. Collection day is Friday. [hip hop music] Did you guys see that look on that guy's face? About 300 a week, we hit off a couple more stores? Forget the 300. I got bigger ideas. This is a little crazy, guys. I mean, I think we're pushing it here. Am I the only one that thinks we're going overboard? Can you ever relax? Take it easy. Let me go take care of these kids. Fifty a piece. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Angelo. We do it again, I'm going to call you. -No problem. -Go out through the back. [Paulie] It was really getting to my brother. He wanted it all, and there was no stopping him. That's when the trouble started. It was on the day we went to pick up our second payment from Singh. Singh, what's up? Everything alright, Singh? Hello, boys. -Stay right here. -Hey! Look who it is. It's the waiters again. Let me blow 'em away right here. Vinny. Vinny! Your dad said we bring them back to him. And that's what we're going to do. First of all, Nobody freelances in my neighborhood. Now, you've come a long way since you left that restaurant. But this time, you went over the line, kid. You went over the line when you decided to shake down a candy store for a lousy 300 dollars. What the fuck are you thinking? I didn't mean any disrespect, Mr. Minieri. I just want to get your attention. You went balls on us, kid. Balls and brains, huh? Alright, sonny. You got my attention. Give me a reason why I shouldn't have Eddie take you out in the back alley and beat you to death with a bat. Mr. Minieri. We're just trying to earn over here. And we've been doing a pretty good job of it. I feel we could do a lot better if we worked with you. With me? Me and my friends. I'd die for these guys. We're very dedicated and loyal to one another. We'll also be loyal to you. Loyalty and respect. That's where it's at, kid. Alright. I'm going to give you a shot. You continue to work with your crew and do what you're doing. Everything you're doing, everything you take down I get a piece. Okay. And no more shaking down candy stores. That's out. Okay? Oh, yeah. Vinny? Vinny. You guys shake hands. I ain't shaking hands. You're shaking hands. Now! That's what I like to see. Everybody get along in my neighborhood. Thank you, Mr. Minieri. From now on, you call me Santo. Okay? Now, get out of here. Go make us some money. Oh. One more thing. I don't recommend that you try to get my attention again. Okay. You're really going to work with these kids? Well, why not? They're raining good, and now, they're working for me. You put the steaks on yet? No, not yet. Would you look at this kid? Three hotdogs and three hamburgers, alright? Are you my fucking mother or what? [muttering] You see Vinny's face when we were sitting with Santo? He can't do shit to us no more. We're in some shape now, guys. Got the main man in the neighborhood behind us. Cent' anni. Good luck, fellas. [Paulie] We were now with Santo. He got a small piece of what we were making, but with Santo behind us, we were making even more. No one would dare to cross us or not pay us. Everything was working out great. Oh! Angelo, sit over here. Keep earning like this, you won't have to go to the city. You can send for it. How's everything going? Good? Good. Um, Guttini Brothers of New York, they came up a little light. I'll take care of it. Anything else? Everything else is pretty good. This calls for a celebration. How's your brother doing? -Good, good. -Alright. He still seeing his girl? Oh, you him. He loves the woman. Amen. -Salute. -Salute. Salute. To your future, Angelo. Thank you. [soft music] Me and my brother, we spent our lives on that stoop. My mother, she'd call us in for dinner from that window. You know, but we'd be playing in the streets so hard, we never heard her. We didn't want to hear her. She'd have to come out of the house, yelling and screaming all the way. "Get back in the house!" But as soon as we hit that stoop, she'd give us both a kiss on the cheek. Aw! She'd say, "Get inside and wash your hands for dinner." Oh, wait. Look. There's Mr. Deleo. Something else, isn't he? [chuckles] He plays that oldies music so loud whenever he waxes that Chevrolet. He's been doing that since I was a kid. Riding around on a Big Wheel all the time. That car is his baby. It's his life. [jazz music] Hey, Santo. [Paulie] My brother was doing everything he could to impress Santo. Good. And what's this? [speaking foreign] He's a number customer of ours. He's got the best cannolis in Brooklyn. What, Brooklyn? They're the best in the fucking city. This is for me. Santo, you're not supposed to be eating those things. The doctor said you've got high cholesterol. You're supposed to watch your fats, too. As soon as you become a vegetarian. Vinny! Vinny! Have a cannoli. No, thanks. Oh, and, uh, don't forget this. Oh. You guys earn pretty good. We're trying, Santo. And you just keep it up. And don't forget. Don't be greedy. Stay smart, and watch what you say on that telephone. That telephone becomes a stick of dynamite. Huh? Alright. What do you say we go eat? We got the cannolis. I'm talking about real food. You know, like a steak. You guys like steak? I love steak! This guy? Whip down five, six steaks no problem. Oh, in that case, he's paying. Let's go. Vinny, come on! No, I don't want to. Come on. I said I don't want to go, Dad. Have steak. -Coffee ready? -Yeah. Hey, they had good steaks last night, huh? Better believe it. Could you believe how many Pete ate? I've never had a steak that good. [doorbell rings] Guys here already? I don't know. Usually asleep right now. Hey, Uncle Tommy. How are you doing? Hey. We made some coffee. Enough of that coffee. Sit down. I need to talk to you guys. I hear you've been hanging out with Santo Minieri. Right? Word travels fast in the neighborhood. What's the matter with you, huh? What are you doing with yourself? And why are you getting your kid brother involved? You know you should be looking after him. Your mother would be turning over in her grave right now. I really don't want to hear this, Uncle Tommy. Now that we finally got some money. Don't got to worry that the landlord's gonna come banging on the door to throw us the fuck out of here. These guys are no good. You know that, right? Huh? They're going to get you in more trouble! Trouble that I can't get you out of. I'm a little older than you are. I've got a little experience. I've been around. Now, I could have been one of these guys, you know. Very easy. I chose not to be. They're the ones that give Italians bad names. Angelo, how long do you think this is going to last? And I got news for you. What are you going to do when he's behind bars? Or when they bury him? It's going to be on your head. He's old enough to do what he wants. He ain't right for this and you both know it. I like hanging out with these guys, Uncle Tommy. I mean, he treat us so good. Last night, they took us out for steaks. And you know what? It felt great to be at the other end of the table for once. Let me ask you a question. What are you going to do when they tell you to put a bullet in somebody? Are you going to do it? That answers my question. I know I can't say the same for you. [dance music] These fucking jerkoffs get to sit in the VIP section now? Forget about it. Look at this girl over here. He's hot. She's sitting with a jerkoff, two. Nah. Why's it take so long for me to get my drinks? You just ordered. I just ordered? Mental giant. Do you know who I am? When I order a fucking drink, I want it here within a fucking minute. You do that, or I'll bounce you the fuck out of here. Understand? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Go, go. That Vinny's a jerkoff. That bartender's just trying to make a few bucks. Come on. Let's go get our own drinks. I'm with you, bro. I'm going to stay over here, alright? Give me a call. Maybe we'll get together next week. Okay. You still nailing her? We have a good time together. A good time? You can hear the girl five blocks away. She's one of those real loud girls. My god. I love those girls. They turn me on. She seems like a nice girl. Why don't you settle down with her? Leave that to him. Hi, doll face. Want to dance? Whoa! That's my girlfriend. [Vinny] I don't give a fuck! As much as I want to see that prick getting beaten, we can't, that's Santo's son. [screaming] Paulie! Paulie? Paulie? Hey. Hey, Santo. I'm teaching her how to play. Hi. I'm Loretta. Angelo. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. -How's it going? -Done. Oh, Jesus. Eddie, do me a favor. Take Loretta for a drink. Go have a drink. -Sit down. -Come on. She probably just got lucky. I think she cheats. This house is amazing. You'll have one just like it. I guarantee it. I want to thank you for what you did for my son the other night. It was nothing, Santo. Oh, no. No nothing. You saved my kids life. How's he doing? Eh, a couple of busted ribs. But outside of that, he's okay. I know, Angelo. I know that Vinny is not the easiest kid to get along with. And I know I make excuses for the kid, although it's natural for a father to want to do that. You see, the thing is, he wasn't born with the same privileges as you. Privileges? No for nothing, Santo. I never remember having privileges when I was growing up. You see, that's exactly what the privilege was. You came from nothing. You've got to fight and scratch for everything you've got. Just like you're doing now. Because in that process, you develop character. You learn to respect. Especially for the people that were fighting just like you are. Privileged? Yeah. Angelo, I think you've got a lot of potential. I think you can go a long way with us. I think you can become a main guy. From now on, I want you more involved in the family operation. What about my friends? Your friends, well, they continue doing what you're doing. They're with you, huh? From now on, you're with me. Where are the Yankees, Dom? They're out three to one. Fuck. Congratulations, Ang. You're probably going to be a big heir soon. If that happens, it's only a matter of time for you guys. -How's the face, Paulie? -It's alright. I get a little dizzy sometimes. Wait until your little girly sees you. Maybe she'll kiss you, make you feel better. Fuck you! Yeah, we're going. Come on, Dom. -See you guys later. -Later. Sit down. I want to talk. Well, you must be happy. Happy about everything but one thing. Oh, yeah? What's that? Remember when we were younger? And that kid around the block wanted to fight you? That big kid. What was his name again? Oh, yeah. No, the bully guy. -Mello. Earnest Mello. -Yeah, that's him. You remember what happened? How could I forget, Ang? He called me out to fight me. Before I could do anything, you were throwing down on him. You stood up for me like you always do. I'm going to stand up for you again. I don't want you involved with us no more. -What? -Not with business. We're making enough money now. Alright, I'll make sure you get paid. We ain't going to be involved. -Come on-- -We ain't discussing it no more. Uncle Tommy was right. It ain't for you. Stay with the girl. Fine. [Santo] I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do with that kid. He keeps doing the same thing over, and over, and over again. Santo, enough, enough. But the kid probably started it. Well, we both know that. I want you to take care of this. How far do you want me to go? Wheelchair. Alright. Mother fucker! [groans] I know you don't need this card. Oh! [coughing] That's six fucking hands in a row. You got a fucking horse shoe up your ass today? That's what I got. Does he always get this hot? -He runs streaks. -You play that number... [Vinny] Look at him kissing up to my father just to get next to him. And the old man's going for it. Hook line and sinker. I know. I see what you mean. ...bring him to the race track. [laughing] You alright? Yeah. I've got to make a couple of stops. [mutters] No, no, no. Angelo, take a ride with me. We'll be back later. Join the game. I want to take your money. [club music] [Paulie] Santo put my brother in charge of the strip club. Asshole. Come on, baby. Come here. Throw him the fuck out of here. You touch anyone like that again, I'll chop your fucking hand off. Get him the fuck out of here. What'd I do? Give me a water. Hey, Ang. They got you running the joint now, huh? Yeah. So I guess we can take any broad we want then, huh? No fucking way. This is a place of business. I don't shit where I eat. You guys definitely shit where I eat. You serious about this? Yeah, I'm serious. Go fuck your masseuse again. I'm fucking sick of her. We want some new girls. I don't care. You want to hang out and watch my back, that's fine. I love you guys. But no fucking around in here. Give them a drink. Anything they want. Give me a bottle of Cristal. Give me a lighter, would you? [Paulie] Santo was introducing my brother to everyone. What's up, Paulie? You still not talking to me? Come on. It's been weeks. You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to. I'm going to tell everybody in the neighborhood you're having phone sex with that girl of yours. I was not. Don't lie. I picked up the phone to make a call. Heard you moaning like a fucking freak. You know what? You're a scumbag. Now I'm never talking to you. You don't have to if you don't want to. At least take a look outside. I've got something I want to show you. What? Take a look. Come on. Yeah? So? Silver one is yours. Oh, shit. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Told you I'd take care of you. It's more than taking care of me, Ang. I think you should go to school. You always said you want to take accounting. Now you can afford to. See if you can get into some schools. I'll take care of it. Come on. Take a look at your new car. Here you go. Oh, my god. I can't believe this. Thank you. No problem, Paulie. I want the best for you. Come here. So when am I going to meet this girl? Soon, Uncle Tommy. I hope she can cook like you. Every time I'm here, it's like Mom's food again. Oh, we had good teachers. Your grandma was the best cook ever. Nobody in this world made meatballs like her. Nobody. I wish she would have known that. She would have adored you. Angelo says hello. I told you I don't want that name mentioned in this house anymore. Come on, Uncle Tommy. I did what you said, alright? He's not going to let me near the business anymore. -He did that? -Yeah, he did. And he said he was going to send me to school That's good. You should go back to school. Uncle Tommy. You're all he's got. He loves you. He needs you right now. He hangs out with bums. You hang out with bums, you're going to become a bum. With all due respect, I think you should be there for him. No matter what he's doing. [muttering] -How are you doing? -Hey, Angelo. Vinny. Caesar's been dealing again. I want you to go with Angelo, grab him out of that pool, and bust him up a little. Dad, he was warned already. Fuck a beat. Let's get rid of him. I want you to listen to me. I said you bust him up a little. That's it. Angelo. Go with him. And Vinny? Take it easy with him. I understand, Dad. I'm going with them. I want these kids to start working together. Let's see how they do. -Alright? -Alright. [groans] Get up. You were warned, cock sucker. One warning is all you get! -I'm sorry. It won't happen-- -Fuck sorry. What are you doing? -He's going! -Your father said a beating. I'll deal with my father. Please, Vinny. You ain't pulling that trigger, Vinny. You don't tell me what to do. Huh, you think you're a boss now? You're putting that gun down, Vinny. Please, Vinny. Don't! [gunshot] What the fuck is wrong with you? You're an embarrassment, for Christ's sake! What are you trying to prove? I make things easy for you, and you're running around like you own fucking Brooklyn! Well, you don't, mister. You don't own it. You're just a spoiled fucking brat. A brat that won't listen. And you're going to respect that kid, Angelo. You hear me? Your new pet? The kid you gave a strip club to run? Your new fucking chauffer? He deserves it. He fucking earned it! He appreciates what he's got. You appreciate nothing! You're just a spoiled, arrogant bastard! Now, maybe that's my fault up to now. If you don't change now, it's going to be your fault. I got news for you. I'm going to make that kid Angelo. That's right. And if you don't listen, he's going to get in before you. I'm telling you, Vinny. He's going to get in before you and I'm going to make you wait! I'm going to make you wait until you act right. Alright, Dad. I hear you. You're going to be the one who's sorry. Especially if you make that kid. I don't know what it is. I don't trust him. That kid that you don't trust saved your fucking life! Get out of here. You ain't doing that right. What are you talking about? You know I taped up plenty of stick ball bats in my day. Remember when we used to tape them and stuff them with newspapers? Every day we play stick ball or fucking wiffle ball. Oh! There's a kid here. Ah, it's okay. I curse. Well, you shouldn't. I love to play sports. But my friends, they don't want to fucking play. I said don't curse, Victor. They'd rather stay home and play on their computers. Like going on the internet and stuff. What is this computers? All we knew was playing in the street. I bet you don't even know what Skully is. What the hell is Skully? Yeah, I told you. They don't know nothing. One day, we'll show you. Hey, Vic. Why don't you go grab your friends out of the house? Victor So is Vinny still being a jerkoff? Yeah. Once an asshole, always an asshole. -How's everything with you guys? -Good! We picked up 10 more customers this week. Good, good. That bank roll's growing. Yeah, yeah. What do you say we go get some lunch? -I'm starving. -Me, too. I'm not in the mood. I'll see you guys later. Come on, Ang. Come with us. Pete, nowhere but lunch. I don't want him on that number round. You told me a thousand times. Don't worry, Dad! Get out of here. Push your chair up this time. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] Alright, alright. Paulie's not here. I, uh, really came to talk to you. Me? You know, you and your brother, you're my only nephews. And I guess I came down pretty hard on you when I found out what you were doing. But you got to understand that's my job. That's the way your mother wanted it, and that's what I did. But I'm glad you listened to me. And you kept your brother out of your business. You know, Ang. We're a family. I just hope it works out for you, baby. That's it. Mm! [Paulie] I finally introduced Tammy to Uncle Tommy. Uncle Tommy, your cooking is incredible! Maybe even better than my mom's. Nah. I've been cooking since I was a kid. Do you think we're ever going to eat this good? Maybe If Uncle Tommy moves in with us. [laughing] So, you're an actress, huh? Mm-hm. Have you've been in anything new? Nothing major yet. Um, I've done, like, some small parts in some independent films. Oh, that's good. I, um, I enjoy a good independent movie. In fact, I go to the Angelica almost every week. What are you laughing about? I do! What are you laughing about? Where do you think I am every Friday night? Nothing. I don't know, Uncle Tommy. I figured maybe you're out with one of your girls -or something. -Yeah, right. With the thousands I've got waiting. I'm really glad you like independent films. I'm hoping that one of them breaks for me. It will, it will. Don't worry about it. You'll be alright. From your mouth to god's ears. What are you going to do if she has to do a love scene with a guy? Nothing. It's only acting, Ang. You are so understanding! Yeah, we'll see how understanding he'd be if you had to do a love scene with one of those young stars. Brad Pitt or one of those guys. [all] Mm? -Brad Pitt? -You're in trouble, Paulie. Yeah. We need the Reds to lose tonight. We're in like six grand on that game. Dom and Pete are probably in a bar celebrating somewhere. Your Tammy's a good girl. I know. I've never been happier, Ang. Wish I could meet a girl like that. What? You? Are you thinking about settling down? Why not? Ain't getting any younger. Hey, listen. Tammy and I are going upstate. Why don't you, uh, bring a girl up there and join us? Nah. I ain't got anybody I want to take up there. Oh, come on, Ang! I'm sure you can find a girl. I can find a lot of girls. But the right girl, you know that. [coughing] Oh, shit. Knock them dead, kid. Your boy's playing like you. [Vinny] Maybe he could be you. Take over the whole fucking family. Why don't you have a little bit more respect for your father, you little prick? Be quiet. I'm talking to my father. -Vinny! -Don't talk to me like that. -Santo? -What's the matter? I can't-- can't-- [chatter] [machine beeping] Hi, Dad. Eddie, wait outside. I want to talk to my dad. [Santo] It's alright, Eddie. Go ahead. I want to talk to Vinny. Vinny. Things are going to have to be different now. You're going to have to change. I know, Dad. You're young. Angelo's young. You should work together. You're right. He's a really good guy. Yeah. I mean, he did save my life. You got Carmine. You know, Eddie. You got to treat them right. That's how you keep the good people around you. When I get out of here, I'm going to make Angelo. You boys are going to be the future now. I'm counting on you. Oh, you can count on me. I know you never thought so, Dad, but I got what it takes to be boss. I really do. I know you do, son. Hey, Angelo. -Angelo. -Hey. How are you feeling? Yeah, don't worry. I'll beat this rep. I want you to know, Santo. I really appreciate what you're doing for me. -I can't-- -No, no. No. It's alright. I know. Angelo. Angelo. I'm so tired. [machine beeping] So... [machine flat-lines] [low chatting] Hey. Did he say anything to you? He was good man. Yeah, we're going to miss him a lot. You guys alright? Angelo, can I speak to you a minute? Give me a couple of minutes with him. Okay. You alright? I never thanked you for what you did that night in the club. You don't have to, Vinny. Yes, I do. That guy was pointing a gun right between my eyes. I know it's a bad time for both of us. I know how you felt about my father and... I'd like to bury the hatchet. That's what my father would have wanted. We're going to be strong together, Angelo. [Paulie] He was good to you, Ang. Yeah, he was. God, you remember the old days? No worries, no hassles, nothing. We were just playing in that street. Time's sure have changed. Hey, listen. If you want me to stay here, I'll stay here. Alright? I don't have to go upstate. What are you nuts? Get out of here. Go. Have fun. I may join you one weekend. There's a girl I might want to take up there. Get out of here! Who? Don't worry. You'll meet her soon. I registered, you know. I'm starting school in September. Alright! That's it. Go have fun. I couldn't ask for a better brother, you know that? Get out of here. [Angelo] I'm telling you. I don't buy Vinny's bullshit. He's going to make a move on us. We got to get to him first. It's about fucking time. I say we do it tomorrow. That's the plan. Vinny and his friends eat at Sam's on Chaney every morning around 10:15. They leave around 11. We leave tomorrow, they'll be there to finally finish this prick off. Are you alright? Mud. Do people always fish this early in the morning? No. They wait until midnight. Brooklyn boy probably can't put a worm on a hook. Hey, believe it or not, I've never been fishing before. But I'm still determined to catch a 10-pound bass. First, you got to cast your line in the water. What, do you think I don't know how to cast? Ha, very funny. How about that? Not bad. -For a beginner. -What are you talking about? That was great! It's nice out here, isn't it? Oh, definitely! We've had this house up here for, like, 10 years. I always, um, come up here and study scripts that I get. Oh, yeah? Hey, Vinny. What are you doing here so early? Hey, Carmine. Coffee ready? It's ready. Mother fucker! [yelling] "I'll be right there. I mean it, Maria. Look, I'm not going to fight. Just go home!" "You better not lie to me." "I love you." I love you? Joey loves you? Hey, Ang. Let me get that thing out of the glove compartment. [Angelo] Alright. Do you have to kiss Joey? Yeah, right after. Like, right here. See? Want to practice? Yeah, let's do that. Okay. [car horn] [gun shots] Oh, my god! I think you got something! -Real it in. -I'm trying! Wait, what happened? [gunshots] Paulie? Paulie? What's the matter? Nothing. [sad music] [cries softly] Seven! Thirteen! Got it in 13. -Hey, that's mine. -Hey! And my dad didn't think I had what it takes to be boss. You're the neighborhood now. Yeah. And I'm glad we finally wasted those fucking wannabes. All but one, Vinny. And you're the fucking wannabes. How much? ...always an asshole. How much ice cream did you eat? Come on. Give it. Give it. Let's go. Tie runs on second. [children laughing] You fucking cheater! Oh! [chatting] Hey! [crowd chanting] Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! [Paulie] My brother always told me: it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, as long as you fight. And now, today, I still think about old times. Hanging out and playing with my brother and my friends on the streets of Brooklyn. ["I Wanna Be Somebody"]
