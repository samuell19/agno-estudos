[tense ethereal music] [logo splatting] [objects rattling] [gentle ethereal music] [audience applauding] [engine roaring] - [Announcer] Use of emergency exit for non-emergency is strictly prohibited. Violators will be subject to arrest and prosecution. Please use authorized exit. - [Skyler] What prompted me to start this is I was a booking agent, booking Chippendales Shows, Hunk Shows, nightclub entertainment, DJs. I was at the point where what I was doing, I didn't think it was something new and fresh. Remembering back then I read the "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" books and I was like, "Call my rich dad." Rich dad said, you know, "Do something new, "do something that not everyone's doing." So, you gotta take a chance and you gotta take a gamble. - [Announcer] We would like to welcome you to Las Vegas. - Morning. [car engine roaring] For me, I think it's a four part equation. It's called tools, team, process, recipe. The tools is the software, the things that you need to run a business. A team is your people, people that you delegate to do the work to. [gentle music] The process is how you're gonna do it. And that recipe, is something that's kinda unique. Recipe is competitiveness or a niche, you know. Oh no. [dramatic music] All right, fellas, listen, I wanna go over some things about the chairs. I heard people been getting hit in the heads with chairs pretty hard. [chair thudding] [man yelling] [audience cheering] Chaos, is that, what's going on here? - Yep, that was my own fault. - What happened? - 'Cause somebody put a heavier chair along with the other chair that we bought, and I went into the ring and pulled a chair out. I pulled the wrong chair out, I pulled the heavy one up. I pulled it out and I took it. - All right. - [Li'l] He hit me like he always does. He ain't gonna back off. - All right. - Make it looks stupid. - So you were actually knocked out. - I was out cold. Jaguar was sitting there yelling at me. And when I finally came through, I finished my match. - Did you wrestle again next night? - Yeah. - Oh my gosh! - [Li'l] This ain't a kid sport. - Well. - This is for men. - Oh my goodness! - But I didn't call Chris and Skyler and said, "Oh, he hit me too hard with the chair." - [Skyler] Right, right. - But everybody else says, "Oh, Nasty Boy hits too hard." [Skyler laughs] - [Skyler] That's what everyone says. - If you can't keep up the game, get out of the player. - Get it approved with me on who's gonna, you know, hit with the chairs. I know you've done this, you, Bow, Rampage. But like if we get some new guys in here, just check with me on that and let me go with it, to make sure that he's trained. - We don't throw them straight into the dungeon. [car engine roaring] - We do something like 100 to 150,000 miles a year by car. We're always on the road constantly, constantly, constantly working, working, working, working. And it was territory after territory, after territory. There was no win back in my younger days. [bright energetic music] - [Skyler] When I first started this business, I didn't know any of the guys. I didn't have a company, I didn't have a wrestling ring, I didn't know any wrestlers. [bell ringing] I contacted P.O.D. bought some pictures, did a little cut and paste, and literally started booking all the shows. - Started wrestling under the name P.O.D., Pissed Off Dwarf. - [Skyler] P.O.D is the man. P.O.D. gave us some help, support, got me going. [audience cheering] - Skyler got a group of guys, and offered them a set pay that was less than their ego wanted. And so by doing that, was able to sell the show for a very, very competitive rate, that nobody could top. Very, very intelligent move on his behalf. - [Skyler] I first started by contacting them and telling them, "Hey I'm the best promoter, "I'm the best booking agent you ever seen in the world, "and, you know, I can lay down so many shows, "and this and that. "I mean, we can book 30 in a month if you want." I'm contacting the guys and no one's talking to me. Yeah, they're not in the phone book. "There he is. "There's midget wrestler right there, let's call him." So, I started selling 'em and eventually... - He filled my head with the right words. So then I came to Oklahoma and went to work for Skyler Ward. I was one of the first original six that created this company. The original six members were Nasty Boy, Short Sleeve Sampson, Bronx Thug, Bad Boy Brian, Tiny Terminator, and the sixth guy's name but. - What'd he look like? - He was, well, he was a midget, and he wore green tights and he wore a mask. They called him Little Bastard. - Check one, two, check one, two. Welcome, to the main event. [audience cheering] [upbeat music] - [L'il] Skyler just said, "We're all gonna make money." This man is a genius, he knows how to make money. He knows what makes money, what doesn't make money. ♪ Who's you calling a short stark ♪ ♪ I know exactly ♪ - [Skyler] The name was not my decision. The name was decided between about four or five different names. ♪ Extreme Midget Wrestling Federation ♪ We had Extreme Dwarf Wrestling Federation, Extreme Tiny Wrestling Federation, and something I wanted to brand called The Little Klondikes Federation, which was a bomb. - It's reality, you're not sugar coating it again. When you say Extreme Midget Wrestling, you know you're gonna have extreme midgets. - [Announcer] Are you ready? "Extreme Midget Wrestling" is here with us live. The gravity divine, ready to slam, wham, and wrestle for their fans. You will not believe your eyes. "Extreme Midget Wrestling," the baddest little show on earth. [indistinct chattering] - [L'il] They didn't wanna be called dwarfs, and they did not wanna be tiny. So, the name that everyone chose was Extremely Midget Wrestling Federation. ♪ Of the brave ♪ [crowd cheering] - My mom's always been a wrestling fan. She'd go to the matches constantly, watching the big wrestlers, and when the midgets came into wrestle, she decided to take me. [crowd cheering] - [Narrator] Li'l Nasty Boy! - But after I'd seen the midgets wrestle, that's when it got to me. That was, the first time I've ever seen it. But as soon as I see the midgets enter the ring, that's when I fell in love with it. I said this is what I wanna do for my life, right then and there I said, "Mom, that's my life right there. "I see my life in front of me" [audience cheering] - Oklahoma, how we doing tonight? I'm gonna give the mic over to our host and our MC, Mr. Mike Crawford. - I was the head of security at a nightclub and then they had this LaBares dancing, and Skyler worked there. [lively cheerful music] ♪ Here we are ♪ - My entertainment background, oh my goodness! I was 18, and I went into a club and I see these guys that have these women just hanging on them, you know, just ridiculous. So I asked the door guy, I go, "Man, what's so special about that guy? "Who's that guy?" And the guy tells me he's a male dancer. I said, you know, at the time I think it was, "Who the hell is that cheesy guy?" [dramatic music] ♪ Here we are ♪ Three or four months later, I entered a best chest contest, and I ended up in the business, and two years later, I ended up running the business and booking shows. - So Skyler did that and then called me one day and said, "Hey, I got this idea about some midgets." - Hey, it's Skinny Timmy with Extreme Midget Wrestling, the midget mafia. I do what I want, when I want, to whoever I want. You think your bad? Step in the ring and I'll show you. Mike Tyson ain't got nothing on me, punk. [cameraman laughs] - I'm just looking for something new. - I had been in the wrestling business for a long time. He's like, "Man, I'm gonna take these midget wrestlers "all over the state." 'Cause he did it with "U.S. Hunks." He set up shows all over the United States. - Skyler got really burned out on the male dancing. Believe it or not, they're kind of flaky. - [Skyler] What I like about the guys is their work ethic. They're willing to work and do the job, and how tough they are. [audience cheering] - Basically I was a club promoter, and the club owner was like, "I got this call today." And he's like, "I think the next thing we're gonna do "is Midget Wrestling." And I was like, "Midget Wrestling?" I was like, "That sounds crazy. "I've never even heard of it." So he gave me Skyler's number, and I called him up, and he was like, "Well, we're fixing to go on tour. "Would you like to come on tour with us?" - I'm telling all the clubs like, "Listen, I have the best show you've ever seen in your life. "Extreme Midget Wrestling Federation, "the number one night club attraction in United States." - So he was telling me he's been doing this forever with the midgets and blah, blah, blah, and all this crazy stuff, and he talked me into it. He picks me up and he waits till we get like out of the state, right, and then he's like, "I have something to tell you." And I was like, "What's up?" And he's like, "I've never done this before." I was like, "What do you mean, "you've never done this before?" He's like, "This is my first tour with the midgets." - Come on, ref! One, two, three, down. - Shoulder's up. - And I was trying to ask him questions and stuff like that and he wouldn't tell me, you know, 'cause he's paranoid or whatever. So, we go and we go to the airport and we're rolling up and we see about six midgets outside. He's like, "Damn, they look good, they look good!" So we pick them up, and the van transmission goes out before we even hit the first show. And I remember Nasty Boy was like, "Great, this is great." 'Cause we just, we stole those guys from another crew. - God bless and good night. [indistinct chattering] - [Man] That's when Nasty Boy left us, and went to go work for Skyler. - One again, I wanna thank everybody, coming out to the Fillmore right here in Summer Springs. [audience cheering] - Me and Skyler paths crossed back when we were doing male dancing. But when it came to midget wrestling, I don't even know when and how he got involved. And I'm like, "Okay, this is a new trend for old strippers "to become midget owners?" It was kinda weird, so I'm like, "Damn, I'm one of them guys now. "I'm an old male dancer owning Midget Wrestling." [Harley laughs] - It's your night! [audience cheering] - "Hey buddy, give me a call. "This is Skyler. "Let's get these midgets going, come on." I remember like he was talking about the ring when he was trying to sell it to me. And he was making all this up. - If you can imagine sitting there selling something that you don't have, I mean, not even just selling something that you do have, but you're selling something that you don't have. [Skyler laughs] It was nuts. - Because I tell it like it is. [woman cheering] And this is one thing I gotta tell everybody here. Your family lives in Oklahoma, which is broke, poor, and also fixed. - Skinny Timmy, he is very entertaining, and he really knows how to piss off a crowd. I've had people throw stuff at me and him all the time. He's pretty much almost started riots. - You don't talk about how Oklahoma should be taken off the face of the United States. - Yeah, where are you from, bro? - I'm from a worse state that you've got, bro. So I'm not going there. - Yeah. - Where was I born and raised? In a little Mayberry town in Indiana called Marion, Indiana. There's hardly anything there. There's no jobs. You guys sooner or later will be mowing my grass. [crowd laughing] - Always been an ill. Well, the ill's the best. - You show me the proper respect that I deserve. [crowd cheering] - 'Cause they get more excited, 'cause you're dirty. And all of a sudden they'll boo at you! Then start saying, "Boo, your dirty son of a!" [laughs] To me it was fun, you know. It's all fun to me anyway. [crowd booing] - You know that you wish your husband had some abs. I've known ever since, probably 5 or 6, I wanted to be a wrestler. Man, I've been watching wrestling my whole life, I knew everything about wrestling. I get paid to be a midget and I'm not really a midget, but I got to say I'm more akin to the midgets, man, because what they don't understand is, I've been called a midget all my life. Skyler Ward was the only dude that gave me an opportunity to be Skinny Timmy. - Get back into the ring. - Shut your mouth. [man groans] [audience cheering] - [Mike] Because it's really hard. There's not a lot of midgets out there that wanna do this profession. It's, you know, a big guy profession. You've got thousands and thousands, but you only have a few select midgets that wanna get out there and get in the ring and hurt their body. [audience cheering] 'Cause he just get midgets that didn't know how to wrestle. He's like, "Man, I need you to train some of the guys." - Okay, do this for me, get the ropes, take a front flip when I tell you. [footsteps thumping] Front flip. [man thuds] Try it again. [playful dramatic music] - Roger Littlebrook, Lord Littlebrook is the wrestling name, came into town, and when I seen him, I went and spoke to him, and I've asked him if I could start wrestling with him, if he'd train me. He said, "No problem." I want to start at the age of 15 years old, but he told me, he says, "Well, you're a little bit too young yet for this, "come next year, then you'll be able to start next year "at 16 years old." I said, "Fine," I said, "I'll see you next year." So when he came the following year, he picked me up. I went over and lived with him on the farm in Havelock, Ontario, Canada, 80 acre farm, and this is where he started training me. [rooster cawing] Roger was very strict. Very, very strict on me. It's gotta be done to the T. - I'm gonna hit you right here. - Yeah, monkey flip him out of the corner. Perfect, that's what you gotta do. - [Woman] Come on, Skinny Timmy, you got this! - Come on! Let's go. Pull my hair! - [Frenchy] Then the next thing after that, it's gotta be done to the T as well. - Man, that's it, man, that's it. - [Frenchy] So when everything is ramped together, and everything's put together, it's done well and it looks nice. [man thuds] [crowd cheering] For me to train before I got into the ring, it took me a year. A year of training, every day, yeah. Before I finally could step into the ring in front of the crowd. [crowd cheering] I was a pack of nerves to be honest with you. [crowd cheering] [man thuds] [crowd cheering] - One, two, three. [audience cheering] - [Chris] We were promoting shows now, and we're bringing them to all ages and families and that audience and that demographic. And this is what we wanna be doing. So I want everyone to have their money's worth. - I don't think you have a kid's mask. [Skyler chuckles] Yeah, you don't have a kid's mask. I got a tighter mask over there. Yeah, come over here. I think the kid's masks are on this side. - First time ever, yes, it was great. - I loved it, it was awesome. - It was awesome. - Yes, I came by myself. - [Reporter] Did you have a favorite wrestler? - Probably Fabio. - Fabio. - I want Fabio. - My favorite is Fabio. - [Announcer] Little Fabio! [audience cheering] - [Woman] We saw a poster and we thought it would be really cool to come watch. - [Crowd] We love Extreme Midget Wrestling. - And I don't like Skinny. - [Skinny] No, you don't! - [Crowd] Yes, we do! - [Skinny] No, you don't! - [Girls] Yes, we do! - No. So I'm kind of stuck in between being a big person and being a midget. So where do I go? I don't know where I go. I know that I'm cool with the midget situation, it's made me famous I gotta say. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. [air whooshing] - [Skyler] Our Texas shows are, you know, those are nightclubs shows and I'm not trying to put down nightclubs shows, but that's where we started, but that's not where we wanna stay. [indistinct chattering] We wanna evolve. We wanna evolve into, you know, I always say the Harlem Globetrotters. Those guys started just a little basketball team and they, you know, they got their uniforms right, and the choreography, and they had scripts, and they were promoting the show, and they went from little high school gyms into big arenas. And that's what I wanna see us do. I wanna see us at the, you know, the Ma and Pa Redneck Bar, you know, and then coming in to the arenas like we did last night. - Skyler is always wanting to improve. - There's basically two people in the world. There's people that are being sold to, and there are people that are selling. So, just look at every situation on what you're doing. Are you being sold to the circumstance? Are you the one selling while you can? And that's an important thing. And the other thing that you have to do, is you gotta have that little formula: tools, team, process, recipe. [upbeat music] - [Announcer] DJ, play that baby making music. [crowd cheering] What else you gonna do? - I got chewed out over a situation with Skyler. - [Kevin] We do this grind the midget bit with Rampage, during intermission. - All the ladies in the contest, we need you in the ring, whoever signed up for the contest, we need you in the ring. - And it was him basically picking females out of the crowd. They would grind on him like a stripper, [crowd cheering] and then the crowd would choose a winner, well then since, you know, there is that return the favor motto, why not let Rampage grind on her. [crowd cheering] - Get it, get it! - Well, Rampage likes to take that a little bit too far. [crowd cheering] - I love it personally. I love to see it. I think it's great. Skyler hates it. He doesn't wanna see it, he doesn't want 'em doing it, 'cause what happens is girls dance on him, and then whoever wins, he gives him the most craziest lap dance ever. I mean, he sucks their toes. [crowd cheering] I've seen some pretty nasty stuff. He would suck toes every night, different toes every night. - [Man] You're a nasty motherfucker! - Weenie wigglin', okay, no more of that. You know, I think we can do wrestling, and we can do mainstream, and we can do, you know, stuff for the families. And this is, it's kinda what I wanna get out of. - [Rampage] Scream! [crowd cheering] - I kept telling the guys don't do that, don't do that kind of show. They went ahead and did it, and I'm really pissed, because they did that whole thing for about 20, 30 minutes, and then there was a break and we lost the crowd. And they think it's great, but sucking on a big toe and dancing, yeah, it's funny and everything, but I think there's a lot more we can do. - [Ref] I wish somebody could help him! He's up, we need some help! It looks like he's getting hurt! - No one's listening to me. We are short on the team and the ref is a pig. [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] - I kept watching wrestling, and that's all I could think about, is how I could become a wrestler. Jimmy Superfly Snuka, and Hulk Hogan, I idolize them still, they're still wrestling, involved with wrestling, and so am I, 31 years later. I've wrestled with him, and of course I can't forget the greatest idol of my life. Woo, the nature boy, Ric Flair. I get excited every time I see him. - Nasty Boy, he's been around for years. I don't really wanna wrestle him because he's just, he likes to wrestle like, I don't know. He likes to shoot on you. You don't wanna get somebody mad that's a shooter. You don't wanna get cute with them in the ring. They'll put a hurtin' on you. [crowd chattering] Shooters are guys that really can tie you up in knots and hurt you. I mean, I can't whoop him. When he gets in the ring, he gets a little arrogant, and he's got a reputation for stretching and hurting other little guys. He stretched me one night in Florida. That's kind of, I mean, that's kind of why I don't talk too much about him anymore. - [Announcer] One swerve again that challenge and a spear. - [Kato] He's big for a little guy. He's a big midget, his arms are bigger than some big guys. I mean he's big. I don't know to many little guys that could take him in the ring. - You have to give credit to the bad guys. 'Cause if it wasn't for the bad guys, the good guys wouldn't look good. - Excuse me, I heard your stutter. Sit down and shut up. [crowd laughing] [indistinct chatter] Don't make lay a whoopin' on you like your momma shoulda. [crowd booing] There you go, American gotta grab a big stick. [crowd laughing] - [Chris] I gotta say Nasty Boy is one of the best guys out there because he can just go over and be hated, and he works with the crowd. - You Nasty Boy. [crowd laughs] - [Chris] The crowd feeds off of him. They hate him, they start booing. He's mean, I mean, he's really mean. The guy is mean. - He's little bit meaner on stage too. - The reason I am the wrestler I am today is because I went through eight weeks in Calgary, Alberta, at the Heart Camp. That was the worst pain in my life. And they were known for like just stretching your body and making you feel lots of physical pain, and making you not wanna do it. [stick thudding] That's why it looks like I can take a whooping and a beating, and I can still get up, when I'm 48 years old and these guys are 20, 25. I wouldn't change anything I did for anything, because I've achieved what I set out do. A childhood dream. I became who I wanted to become. And I'm happy doing what I do because this is me being an entertainer. - Ah, stop! Ow, that hurts! - Did I get the nipple? - Yes. - Yes! - This is how Extreme Midget Wrestling gets rich. - [Wrestler] I'll give you 100. - Where's your 100? - It's in there. - Give it to me. - Let me see you lick it first. - Mother fucking [speaking in foreign language]. - What are you doing? - Come on! Lick it. - Give him the nipple. - Dude! - I wanna lick your nipple. - Get it. [guys laughing] I will lick your nipple, ah! - We make 150 a night, and you guys are doing degrading things for 50 bucks. - You make 150 a night, we don't. - That's even worse. - Yeah. - [Frenchy] The way you work is contract or being paid by the gig. Working that way with promoters, I've always wrestled by percentage of the crowd. - Philadelphia, are you ready? - An example, if you wrestle and you ask for that certain amount of money, and there's a big freaking crowd, we instead make 100 bucks, guaranteed, that's what you asked for, and you get a big crowd where you could have made 500, well, you won't get that. [crowd cheering] - What inspires these guys is not so much money, it's the fact that they're idols, [wrestler thuds] [crowd cheering] and it's really a love of wrestling that they get into this. So the bumps and all that that they're doing, they're doing because they love it. [wrestler thuds] [crowd cheering] You know, with the Federation that we have, they make a lot more money than they ever would going to work in any show. I remember being on the road and getting gas and getting food at McDonald's, and I noticed, you know, some kids kinda point and then maybe making a little bit of fun of, and then I see him at the show, where they're on center stage and on the stage, they're now a rockstar. [crowd cheering] - Daily life, when you're walking, like when we're all back home, and you're walking through a store or through a mall or anything like that, you don't get the same reaction you do. But you did. - No, you don't. - They actually pointed at you, taking pictures and. - You get a much negative, different reaction, when you're back home living your own life. - I have a great team, this team right here. This is the midget mafia. These guys are the best. The bits of feedback that I get on the road from you guys is just phenomenal. - Skyler, I actually have a question. - [Skyler] Go for it. - Like with all the bookings and stuff, are we getting like a lot more bookings where to the point where we can get picky, at what venues you should play at, or are you pretty much taking anything that's offered to us? Just a curiosity. - Are you gonna say no to money? - [Man] Huh? - You're gonna say no to money? - Well, if, no, it's. - Are you gonna say no to money? - No. - That just answered your question. - No, what I was saying was is like, are we getting over booked to the point where we can start getting a picture. - Yes, better money. - Better than a gig. - Yeah, better money, better everything. - But you gotta take the good with the bad. It's not all gonna be gravy. - Yeah. - That's road life. - When you're a midget wrestler, you don't just stay in one federation. You're indie, I mean, you go to all different types of federations. [dramatic music] - [Announcer] Tokio makes a tag. There comes little Koto. Little Koto and Lord Littlebrook. [audience cheering] - My father wrestled for many years. He wrestled all over the world. So he'd wrestle for a month or two with WWF, there was AWA out of Minneapolis, there was NWA out of Atlanta, and then he would be in Tennessee wrestling for the Jared's. I mean, he traveled all over. Actually the indie circuit now is more than it used to be. And the reason why is 'cause WWE. Mr. McMahon, he just took out all the other big federations. - There's lots of politics and controversy back in the day and it became a derogatory statement to use the word midget. - So people just started doing indie shows. [crowd cheering] - [Announcer] He gets a duplex. He's the strongest midget. - Once in a blue moon, you'd actually get a midget match on the indie circuit 'cause most time, a lot of your indie federations have one little guy who lived close by, that did know how to wrestle, but he didn't have another little guy to wrestle. [crowd chattering] Through me getting a phone list of each one I'd meet on this federation, this federation, this federation, you know, we started trading numbers up. - [Announcer] You need to stop drinking before you come to work. - You know, then for Li'l Nasty Boy, for example, up in Oregon, needed somebody to come up and wrestle him on that federation. His promoter of that federation would fly me or somebody else in or somebody else in. Each month they'd have a genuine little midget division. And then we just started realizing that we got each other's phone numbers on, we could keep the momentum going. [comical upbeat music] The flowchart of midget wrestling was like a carnival circus act, one match, comedic, slapstick, make everybody laugh. - [Announcer] They really need a full lightweight. - [Skyler] Sky Low Low, Little Beaver, on into Lord Littlebrook. Lord Littlebrook kinda brought it up to where it became, people remembered the midget wrestlers' names and became somewhat fans. Then midget wrestling kind of died off for several years. [upbeat music] Then came the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em. It was a sports circus. On into Micro Wrestling Federation, Halftime Brawlers, on into Micro Championship Wrestling, then Extreme Midget Wrestling Federation. - [Skyler] Do you know what I do and it's really hard? We have to get three or four shows together at one time, if we don't, we're in a hole. It's a gamble each week. [Rampage snoring] The way that we're doing it now is we have to get in a van, drive sometimes all night, [crowd cheering] break the ring down, do the next city same thing over and over and over again, and it wears the guys out. - Ah, my back! [gentle uplifting music] Las Vegas is important to me in Extreme Midget Wrestling because we were looking for a venue to where, rather than us going to the people, we have the people coming to us. Every week it's a whole new crew of people that come in and out, people that are gonna come in and possibly buy tickets for our show. It's not an easy town to get into, you gotta know somebody just to get in, somebody who has contacts, who's connected with all the casinos' entertainment directors. [crowd cheering] In 2012, we did our show at the Riviera. Tremendous success, we sold out their little auditorium, had 1,000 people. We did about nine shows there. All of them were sold out. As a test run, I thought it was perfect. Has the Plaza had a lot of shows there? - Yeah, now they have a group called the Fat Pack, I think, there, it's kinda, but it's not gonna keep, you know, it's not a real viable show, it's not drawing a lot of people or anything like that. I gotta take this. - I got you. - What's up, Frankie? No camera. - [Skyler] You know, it's not always what you have, but it's also who you know, and how much money you got in your pocket to promote a show. - [Steve] Yeah, that's. - I gave you a copy of that, do you have it? - [Steve] By the time we pay, let's say eight performers, how many performers do you think we're gonna have to add? - [Skyler] Eight high paying. [upbeat music] - You know, my wife, she's getting to the point where she's tired of being alone. And you know, I can't be mad at her, man. I leave her there for months upon months by herself. Man, I've always had a thing for midget girls. [crowd cheering] It's hard to find a fake midget girl. It really is, I've been looking, but I never thought in my wildest dream that I would be married and have a baby. I mean, I was there for when he was born, but then again the road called and I was gone. So technically, I think I'm a bad husband 'cause I put my wife and family on the back burner. Wrestling ain't nothing without my son. It's been a great nine years, man. But I gotta jet on home, take care of my daddy responsibilities. This is Skinny Timmy saying a farewell. - Skinny Timmy, ever since I've known him, he's been on tour with us for almost three years. And I've heard him say a million times that he's gonna quit. But he never quits. He always calls back, "I'm ready to come out, man. "I'm ready to wrestle, Skinny Timmy." [crowd cheering] - Michael Anthony Coletti, [crowd cheering] they call me Midget MAC, 'cause that's my initials. It's just me, it's what I do. I MAC on ladies. - [Announcer] Good evening, Woodrow! [crowd cheering] - [MAC] Y'all ain't loud enough! - Gotti, he's new. We started the new guys off as a referee, so they can watch, they learn, instead of just throwing them out there to get their ass kicked. - Hey, hey, come on. [crowd cheering] Get back in the ring. - [Interviewer] Did you go to college? - Yes, I did go to college. [wrestler groans] I went for criminal justice. - [Announcer] Here's our little wrestling ranger! [crowd cheering] - And at the time, I couldn't find anything in the career. So after I went to job coy for carnie jobs. I did work at McDonald's, [crowd cheering] and they gave me like a step stool, but, like, it worked for me. But everybody else, they pretty much saw me as like a hazard in the kitchen. [crowd cheering] - Can y'all give me some feedback on Gotti over there, the wrestling ranger? Okay, last time he did not improve at all. [crowd cheering] Gotti, let's see, I did talk to him about working. Some guys says it's gonna take him longer. So, we work with guys as long as it really takes, and it really falls back on us. That's our responsibility. - Let's practice that one, okay. - Okay. - You wanna give you. 'Cause he ain't wrestling me every night. I wanted to look good too, and that's why I want him to look good. So, I'm trying to guide him, trying to teach him, and he listen, so that's good, 'cause if you don't listen, then we gonna have a fight. Ready, ready, ready. You know why? 'Cause I don't wanna look stupid in the ring. - One, two. - Just go out there and have fun and show this place what we do. One, two, three. - [Men] Midgets! [crowd cheering] - Now, my dad always taught me, whatever you're doing, you gotta be 110%. [crowd cheering] You gotta prove them that you can do this, because you're short. I was young, it's hard, 'cause they pushed me around, [crowd cheering] and I fight back. Don't push me, no, don't touch me. And then they call me midgets. The midgets word, it doesn't hurt me. [crowd cheering] My dad always says that you gotta accept people, they gonna call you midget all the time for the rest of your life. So you gotta accept that now. So I accept it, I'm a midget. - Fuck you, you fucking midget! - Whatever people says, I don't care. You know, just brush it off, you know what I mean? [crowd cheering] We went to appointments. The doctor offered that they can make me taller, put an extension in my knee and my elbow. And I said, "Let's do it." You know, I don't wanna short forever, you know. But my dad said, "No, you know, you don't want that, "because that can hurt you, you know. "It can mess up your body." And I cried, you know what I mean? I'm like dang. For a long time I said, "Why?" And I kinda like got mad at my dad, [crowd cheering] but I see why, you know. I see why he said no. [crowd cheering] And so I said, "Thank you, thanks dad." You know? - Well, me and Eddie, we're in a, we played basketball three years ago? - Yeah. - In Nashville, that's the first time we met. But all of us in the same teams, it's called the statements. [indistinct] [crowd applauding] - [Frenchy] I trained quite a few of them. Most of them are basketball players, and they trained to wrestle instead of, other than basketball. [crowd cheering] - [J-Mazing] I learned my wrestling from Frenchy Lamont. He's also a legend of being a major wrestler. [crowd cheering] I met him in Canada during a basketball, and he taught me the wrestling, and basically everything that I know. [crowd cheering] - He came from the Philippines. Some of them are easy than others, but him, we just kinda connected, you know? [man thuds] [crowd cheering] He just had that knack about him. [crowd cheering] - College, it was a totally new experience for me, because coming up through high school, graduating with honors, you know, when I was being used to like being the smart one and everything, and then you get to college. - [Crowd] Fuck Fabio, fuck Fabio, fuck Fabio! - [Fabio] And it was just so much more difficult. You know, you started thinking, okay, maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was, you know? - [Crowd] Stop being a bitch. Stop being a bitch. Stop being a bitch. I never really watched wrestling at all, growing up. It wasn't until high school, one of my best friends, he'd be like, "No, no, dude, you gotta watch this." And he plays out there and I'll be like, "Yeah, faking." He's like, "No, no, rewind it." And he'd like, make it go like in slow motion so I could see the impact of the hit. And from that moment, I just became obsessed with it. I was over at his house one night, and Air Paris called him up and said, "Hey, you know, we've got this show going on "in Cedar County, Georgia. "I really need to find a midget." This guy, he's like, "Dude, I got one at my house right now!" He was like, "Really? Put him on the phone. "Hey, how do you feel about wrestling "a guy named Skinny Kenny?" How bad could it be, you know? His name is, Skinny Kenny all ready. [dramatic music] He weighed probably 400 plus pounds. I was absolutely terrified. - [Interviewer] What pushed you to go through with it? - Just the love of wrestling, I guess. Well, that, and they kinda did just shove me out of curtain. Most of the guys that I wrestled for my first year and a half, two years, they were all tall guys. This was on the independence. I actually used to work for a promotion called RPW, Rampage Pro Wrestling. They do biweekly television tapings, and there was a manager there, he came out. He had a big white suit, you know, big white cowboy hat, kinda resembled Boss Hogg from "Dukes of Hazzard," we used to call him Charlie Cash. They brought me into the show to be Pocket Change. - [Commentator] What's going on in the ring? What's going on in the ring? Pocket Change and Charlie Cash, they're not wrestlers. - I was basically his mini me. [crowd chattering] Wrestling, I guess is probably what really got me to break out of my shy shell. The thing that shocked me the most, is like with the ladies, [wrestler thuds] [crowd cheering] 'cause I'm like, "Well, maybe I am like semi-attractive "or something, I don't know." [Fabio laughing] - It's Fabio right here with my woman! He's getting naked in a minute. - I've heard people be like, "How much is it for a midget? "I want that guy over there." - Every woman's bucket list. - You might think you're tall and stuff, but dynamite comes in small packages. [woman laughing] - There you go, that's the truth. She's been after you guys for a while. [woman laughs] - [Woman] I don't even know yet! [everyone laughs] - So do we bring you a condom? - You know it is true they get a lot of women, but they don't know what to do with. [laughs] - Ooh boy, it's been a while since I had a girlfriend to be honest with you. [woman shouting] - Hey? - How're you doing? Filipino girl. - Filipino girl. - Oh, the Filipino girl. - When was this? In Utah, right? - Yeah, it was in Utah. - No. - Like, yeah, it was in Utah. - It was in Utah. - Yeah, and she came over to me and I talked to her for a minute, and then I asked her where she was from or something, and she said she was Filipino. I was like, "J-Amazing, yeah, little tiny midget, "this one, he's Filipino too." She's like, "Oh really?" Then she set out to find him. - Was she from the Philippines too? - Yeah, she's Filipino. - Me and Mike go way back. - Yeah, really? - Like five seconds. - How far, five seconds? - She's Puertorican, I'm telling you. You don't know? - Pretty crazy. - Come on, Texas! Pick up your A-game, right? - Where did you come from? We love you. - I'm from New York. - Donny. - Doony, Emily, pleasure to meet you. - Nice meeting you too. - I haven't really wrestled yet. But when he brings me out, I'm called Little Thrasher. - Why don't we call you gigolo? - How about, no. - Just a little gigolo. - [Emily] Wait, why are you guys in town? Here in St.Louis? - Midget wrestling. - Don't tell me it's a dream, are you serious? You're dream sellers! - Skyler's talking shit, I don't gigolo. - I swear I thought you had a little black book. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Seriously. [Emily wooing] Skyler, I was thinking about wrestling in my room. - Naked? - Exactly. - That was how Johnny Flores will scare a woman away right there. Yeah. - What, yeah. - Thanks Johnny. Johnny, they talk to you and they run. Have you noticed that? - Have you noticed that with Rampage? No. - No. - What did I do? No. - You carry that box around? - What box around? You've seen my box. It's full of my shaving stuff. And stuff to look pretty for the night. - See, gigolo-ing. - I'm trying to pull bitches. I don't do it for money. [window bangs] [crowd cheering] - From little rock in Arkansas, you love him or you hate him. Make some noise for Li'l Rampage! [crowd cheering] - See, I had a grandma. We always had to sit there and watch wrestling. We used to watch every Monday, Thursday, Sunday. One of us or her kids, they gotta make sure that she has got some KFC chicken, or some skins. If she ain't got no skin, she's not watching wrestling. If she ain't got no KFC, she's not watching wrestling either. Her favorite guy was The Rock and that was my favorite guy too. [audience cheering] That's who used to take care of me. That's who used to be the mama. To tell the truth, I like being the size I am. I got here, I got a baby mama. She's like, nobody call me or her son a midget. 'Cause my little boy, he a midget too. I really tried to work it out with my baby mama. I thought she was the baddest chick I ever had. So, she was a stripper, I was a stripper. She was a hoe, I was a hoe. I'll be honest, I was a pimp. - We did a show in Little Rock. So he came out for it and he did his little strip thing. The next day I convinced him. I was like, "Well, are you gonna come on tour with us?" He was like, "Well, we gotta go to my parents' house." And I was like, "Oh my God, dude. "You're like in your 20s, "and we gotta go to your parents' house?" - Sitting next to mom's house, living at home. He was pimping at mom's. - He wanna come with the jokes too. - His whole family's outside waving goodbye. They probably had a party afterwards. - Rampage. - Rampage. - Not a big fan. - It is what it is, Rampage's gonna do Rampage. You know, some guys come into this company, you know what I'm saying? They think they stars 'cause they been on TV. - He had a very big head when he first came in from doing the male stripping thing. - They say I'm a whinin' baby, wanna get my way. - He refused to sit in the back of the van. He had to have front seat, otherwise he would raise all kinds of hell. - He's just cocky. - Ah, nah, I ain't sitting back there. Oh, you can sit back there. - Everybody in this company, somewhere down the road, does not like Rampage. - It ain't all about what they think. - Rampage is running naked down the hotel rooms, you know, down the hallways, and back and forth and screaming. And it's like Rampage, calm down. - You know it's gonna freak you out if you get a knock on the door and you see a little black midget sitting there naked just staring at you. [Rampage laughing] - Yeah, it's pretty hard to get fired around here. - You know, Skyler Ward, I think he is a good person. I know I messed up a lot with Skyler, like, I blew one of his vans. Well, actually to be real, I blew two of his vans up. - [Skyler] He was chaos, terror. - I was hitting the gas real hard, it wouldn't go. [upbeat music] - [Kevin] This drunk intoxicated person, decided to pick a fight with Rampage. [crowd cheering] I jumped in the middle of this and he gets mad at me. He balls up his fist. [guys yelling] - Too damn old for this crap. - I've tried to talk to Rampage. It's like talking to a rock or a wall or anything. - [Crowd] Rampage, Rampage, Rampage! - This is why you need to talk to Chris and Skyler. You're the road manager. - I've talked to Chris and Skyler, everybody's talked. - They've gotta do something. They baby him too much. [crowd cheering] - [Skyler] Kevin Bradshaw, Road Manager. I give a lot of props to any manager that has to do that. - Ow! - Ah! - Hey, I'm in the middle of this! Somebody didn't put on deodorant. Put some fucking deodorant on in the mornings. - Six, seven, eight little people in the van is horrible. - You want anything, my child? My cranky little bundle of shit? - Shut the fuck up, man. - [Kevin] Hold on, hold on. - There's gonna be a fight every day. Everything is in there. Like the germs, you know, the anger, everything. That van is nasty. - You start washing your hands sometimes. - Keep watching out for my sticky ass hoes. - They will drive you crazy. One guy who wants to go to Walmart, one guy wants to go to the bank. - I call Denny's. - Let's go see a movie. - This guy wants to do this, this guy don't wanna do that, he don't wanna eat there, he wants to eat there. - Are we stopping again? - [Chris] You can't do nothing to keep them happy. One of them's always pissed off. I mean, you just can't keep them happy. - We just ate! - I said I'm not even hungry. - [J-Mazing] I know. - I know! - [Skyler] I wanna see the guys in a better vehicle. You look in the van and you got six guys, six to eight guys are sleeping on the floor back there, and it doesn't look too comfortable. They're not getting good sleep. And when they wrestle every night, they really need to be in a bed, you know? Lettin' their legs kind of heal, and you need a lot of rest to heal. And if you're bouncing around in the van, trying to get rest that way, it's not full rest. ♪ Dealing with it all ♪ Woo! The sun, the life, baby. - Skyler is a very paranoid person because he has been kicked in the balls by so many people. - [Woman] Are you done with your drink? - Why can't I bring this in? - [Woman] Can you drink it outside? - [Skyler] This is a medicine. - [Woman] This? - Yes, medicine. I have a cold. Hey, what are you doing? - [Chris] I got a call today from the guy in Charlotte, and he was telling me that somebody called him, and they said that they were a midget named James, that used to work for us, and that we were canceling the show. - See, that's why I'm so secretive. - And a male dancer thing. You know, girls wanna see new meat all the time. They wanna see new guys. So you can just can't keep coming back with the same guy, same guy. So what we do, we exchange numbers, exchange the venues, for a girl to see different stuff. But when it came to midget wrestling, it's top secret. - It's just bullshit. It's bullshit in the entertainment business. Some little fuckhead calls up and saying we're canceling our show. - But then you got people undercutting like Skyler, who would come back behind you, find out your venue and cut you. And just to get the gig from you. - Nobody likes when you make money. - [Woman] That's okay. - This is a fucking war. - [Chris] Trying to fuck our shit up. It's time to go to war, player. - That's right, motherfucker. - [Chris] It's time to get gangster. - That's right, bitch, I like that shit! Pumpin' me up! You know, when I first started the company, I didn't have everyone sign. And that's when I learned about contracts. I get all my midget wrestlers kidnapped. We were this beautiful family, you know, me being the Vince McMahon of Midget Wresting and them being just loyal midget wrestlers and all of a sudden, about three, four or so jumped ship and went to someone else. - [Man] Who was the macaroni? - Macaroni. - Jim Macaroni. - Fat Jim. [dramatic suspenseful music] ♪ Fuck you ♪ - [Skyler] I call him Jim Macaroni. And he doesn't have any of my respect to even say his last name. We just call him Macaroni. - This Macaroni guy booked us in New York. And soon as we pull up, he comes out, this Macaroni guy, and I didn't like him right away. This guy was just like rude as hell and just slimy. He's a big, fat, slimy guy. And some weird things started happening. Like first, I go outside and the van won't start. [engine roaring] - [Skyler] Macaroni, sly cat, little weasel. He unplugs our fuel pump to our van so that the van had ended up in the shop. You remember the guy from Buffalo, New York? - That boy from New York. - I ain't like him to tell the truth. He took us to Arby's. What kind of promoter would take you to Arby's? ♪ Cheesy ♪ ♪ Sleazy ♪ - Next thing I know, Rampage is telling me this Macaroni guy is gonna start his own company, and all these guys are gonna work for him. I guess some of the guys they weren't really happy about pay. - Things were a little bit edgy. - These guys, they would just go wherever the works at. If you give them 20 shows a month, they will work for you. They'll stick to you and stay by your side. You give them five shows a month, they're gone. - And then the next thing I know, Skyler calls me and he's like, "They all went with Macaroni." And the only one we had left was Rampage. - Rampage not going was Fat Jim' decision, and Bad Boy's decision, and well, Nasty's decision, and everybody's decision to be honest with you. - Rampage would have never went with him anyways. Rampage is like the loyalest guy ever. - I was promised the moon and I was not given my moon. I was given a load of crap. - [Fabio] We were sleeping in our tour van which was this old busted up ice cream truck. - [Announcer] That's cold, Macaroni. - [Fabio] We had shows at North Dakota, South Dakota, where it got to -20 degrees. And we were just like bundled up in these sleeping bags. Basically just trying to stay warm. - [Announcer] Ice cold. - He tried calling one of my midgets one time, and I was like, "Okay." I was like, "Well, give me the phone. "I'm gonna pretend I'm your brother." So I get him on the phone, I was like, "What's up, man? "You want my little brother?" He's like, "Yeah man, I like to use him." And I was like, "Fuck you, Macaroni!" I was like, "This is me, you know what I'm saying?" ♪ Fuck you, Macaroni ♪ And he's like, "Oh man, oh, man." I was like, "You just live with your mom. "You ain't nothing but a big fat slimy piece of shit." ♪ Cheesy ♪ ♪ Sleazy ♪ I was like, "Fuck you, Macaroni." ♪ Fuck you, Macaroni ♪ When everyone jumped ship, we had Rampage and we had Skinny Timmy. We got on the phone one more time. Call and call and I found Baby Jesus and Little Devil out there. I was accused of taking my whole team and leaving. I did not take anybody with me. - Nasty Boy, we finally let him come back. But when he came back, we treated him like shit for a while. [crowd cheering] - Without skipping a beat, we just went down the road, and we're still here today. Three years later. - I still had to say, "Fuck you, Jim Macaroni, "New York slime ball." ♪ Fuck you, Macaroni ♪ ♪ Fuck you, Macaroni ♪ ♪ Cheesy ♪ ♪ Sleazy ♪ - [Skyler] That's funny, Jim Macaroni.

What's going on? - I think it's just like the hazing that I haven't been in the ring yet. [Skyler laughs] - The hazing? - Jonny, a lot of your stuff that comes to you, you bring on yourself. - How so? - You can't go out there and be Mr. Arrogant Cocky. I'm the new guy, I'm. - Almost a fruit loop. - I say you test the water. - I thought we took it easy on you. Yeah. - Really? - I'm gonna hit you. You ready? [indistinct] [guys laughing] - Hit him. - I'm gonna hit you. - No. - I'm gonna hit you. - No. Enough's enough. - Come on, come on. - I ended up with a ribber. All wrestlers get that. That's a great tradition. That's the way we get blessed. Because it's like a gift in a way. It's like a gift. It's something that you never forget. I don't care how old you are. [Fabio laughs] - It's like Harry fricking Potter. - Some jokes are good. Some jokes are bad. Some ribs I don't believe. I don't believe in, because they're too. It becomes another bit no more. - You look like a fruit cake. Fucking jackass dude. - When you green, green as grass, you don't know. - Get on the ground, bitch. - Get on the ground? - Get on the fuckin' ground! - Oh my shit! Oh my shit! Oh, oh, oh shit! Who's going on the ground? Who's going down, what's the guy? - [Fabio] Am I gonna get to see any punches? - This is some funny shit. - Gotti, don't be a pussy. - [Rampage] He about to be in a minute. Y'all wanna bet? - [Gotti] So just, hey, throw him back on the ground and pull your dick out again. - That's what I'm about to do. - [Gotti] It's still neutral. Here we go, here we go. - [Gotti] Oh, swing on. - [Fabio] Quit playing grab-ass. - But I'm watching you there squealing there, dude. - Get off of me! - You good, you good? - You better move before I punch him. Wait till we out the van. - We're family. Like you said, we're family. [everyone laughing] - You're gonna have to become Rampage's bitch tonight. Get on the ground, bitch. - Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Say another fuckin' word! - Another fuckin' word. - Say another fuckin' word! - Another fuckin' word. - [Gotti] Uh, oh. Uh, oh. Uh, oh. Stop it right there. - Stop the van! - [Gotti] Dude, that's the best view right there. - Just go get the fuck out my way. Before I hit you on your motherfucking face too. - [Gotti] He said stop, so. - Stop, nigga, if you don't get the fuck out of here, I'm gonna bust your fucking face. Don't play with me like that dude. - When I was in high school, there was this bully that I had. And then he comes up and tries to pick on me, and then tries to pick a fight with me, and then you know how kids are, they pull out their camera phones, and once I see like three camera phones out, I just thought to myself, "Great, "if you let him beat your ass now, "you look like a pussy for the rest of your school year." So I just had to do something about it, and then, yeah. - [Woman] What'd you do? - F'd him up. And he didn't look at me in the eye ever again till the school year was over. Left me alone, like. - That's a beautiful story. - [Rampage] Hey, you wanna be my bitch? - [Jonny] I was just asking. - Hey, do you wanna be? - I was asking. - You wanna be? - No. - Do you wanna be? - No. - I was asking. - Get out of my face. - [Skyler] I stay out of it. I call myself the mother of 10 illegitimate children. - What you major in? - History and political science. - One day he's gonna be teaching our youth of America. - Show y'all what it's all about. - Are we playing for money? I need $5 so I could eat tomorrow. - Let me get two all the way down. He about to be out of $5. Ah! Drop that money. - $10. You and me, $10. All right. - All right. - You got $10 right now? - [Jonny] I don't, but I'll pay you back if I lose. Swear to god. - Break them up. - All right. - Ah! Good game, dog. - Yeah. [indistinct] - [Rampage] Hey, it's better honey than anybody. Anybody see that, what the fuck was that, dude? - You gotta hit the ball. - Skyler, he loved the guys. It was like having a bunch of, you know, brothers that work together. - I know, I know. I realize that. Don't yell at me, you little bitch. - Let's go to this other bar. - What other bar? - It's got naked girls dancing on the bar, and free food, and drinks are half price. - [Deedra] You know, he really loved the guys. He took a big interest in them. - I see why people pick on you now. - Why? - You got a little bit of a mouth on you. [upbeat music] - [Deedra] It didn't seem like it was just business to him anymore. Like it was his little family. He wanted to give them work where they could make a living. He had promised them the sun and the moon at the beginning, to get them just to pay attention to him. Skyler wasn't very close to his family. Sometimes he's a closed book on a lot of things, and he doesn't show emotion very often. It was definitely not good on our relationship. - [Skyler] I am on the market right now. I just got out of a 10 year relationship. Business definitely plays a part of it. To run a business, you have to be dedicated. I mean, I remember, hey, it's Thanksgiving. I can get in here and get some extra work done to get ahead. I have a joke about wanting to write a book called "Why not to start a business." And tell them all the things that you're gonna have to sacrifice. - That man was a working fool. Driving down the highway, he was on his computer, on his phone, making us money. - I liked to tour when he was like that though. 'Cause if anything happen, he gonna make sure it's done, right then and there. Flat tires, guys don't got no money, you hungry, right there. Now one of us going back there, we'd be two hours sitting in the desert, like we got a flat, we gotta wait two hours guys, till the trailer get fixed. - No sweat on my back. I mean, I got dirt on some people. I just don't talk bad, and I don't sling mud. - You have to let us know. I went up to Rampage and asked him, I was like, "Hey, do you have some guests coming?" And he's like, "Yes, I told Skyler." I was like, "Why didn't you not let me know?" He goes, "Because I let Skyler know." I go, "Skyler is not here." He started blowing up in my face, calling me a bitch. Here you go, take a break. You're off for tonight. - Someone being derogatory, or they just trying to act like they're the man? - I believe because you black. I'ma dock you, buddy. I'ma dock you. - Someone's docking you 'cause you're black? - No, it ain't because of that. But, I don't know anyone he docked. - [Skyler] So you're saying you're the only one that's been docked? - [Rampage] Yeah. - And other guys haven't been docked? - [Rampage] No. - Do you remember me sending Nasty Boy home for two weeks? - No. - Two weeks, it was a month. - I'm out here to make money. - We are all out here for that. - I mean right here. - I wanna to point out though, is you think like you're the only one being picked on, there's other people who've been disciplined, and there's other people that have lost money. But what I'm saying is, you know, I'm gonna be honest with you, your name does come up a lot for controversy and drama, so. - I'm Rampage, it's gonna come up a lot. - Okay, I agree with you. - If the company could be better without me, hey, oh, well. - [Skyler] Alrighty. - [Rampage] That's how I feel about it. - [Skyler] All right. - Rampage, you're going down. I hope you quit, man. If you wanna go home and cry because you're not gonna get your way, you gotta put your big boy pants on and go home and check it out. - One thing in business, you never embarrass your boss. Never. - [Kevin] Hey, Rampage, Fabio, you're gonna like this one. I even paid him an extra 20 bucks, too. - Basically, special Kev payed me a little extra tonight to make sure your Rampage stays in line, get the job done. - You need somebody like me that makes sure you guys stay in line. So, how many are ready for some midgets? [crowd cheering] This is not Rampage Extreme Midget Wrestling show. I've been waiting for this match all night, you guys. You think you can say, do, whatever you want, just because you're a midget, and on top of that, you're black. You can't play those types of cards and think that you can get in life like that. The cards you need to play are the ones that you don't burn any bridges, you build them. [dramatic music] And you know, you're not gonna take any advice from me, or any lessons, or anything I wanna teach you, I'm gonna ignore it, and you're gonna be put on the back burner, and I'm gonna forget about you. These heads will rock, I like it to be a sponge. He could soak in a lot of information. He could be smart, but he chooses to be, [laughs] I'm just gonna leave that one blank for people out there. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] - I'll be feelin' in, baby, no different than any other match. - [Woman] And how about Rampage, how's he doing? - He got the worst of it. - [Woman] So, are you guys cool with each other after a match like that? - Being the first match you gotta, you know, you really gotta start the show off with a bang, you know, to keep them into it, get 'em into it, 'cause you wanna leave a good first impression, you know, when the show starts. - [Woman] You pissed? - No. - [Woman] Are you all right? - [Kevin] We all fight like. - What'd you think? - It's all resolved and over with at the end, we just. - We're finished. - Well, there's some things that have to be done. I mean, we don't like doing it. No, but it's some things that just have to be done. - [Rampage] I think Nasty Boy's great, 'cause he trained with me, you know what I'm saying? But, I'm not close to him that way. They all turn on you, you know, like Skyler said to me. - You know where Moneybags buyers is that? I remember, yep. Let's go back over what that meeting was, 'cause right now they're not really seeing it. - And they don't wanna give us the ballroom. Then I don't know that they have a space for us to work there, you know. If he's not making money or at least breaking even, and getting the big drop in the casino, he's not gonna stay with it either. - [Skyler] Right. - [Steve] And a deal is not a good deal unless it is a win-win. And it's not gonna stick or last if it's not, so. - [Skyler] We were looking for another place to play, and Steve Moneybags, he decided not to invest. He dropped out and didn't want to go through with it. So he's just playing it safe. And that's cool. [indistinct chatter] - Hey, man, I've been up here for five hours. Can I get something? Guess who's back? Skinny Timmy, 62 days, man. [crowd cheering] I can't be away. I'm Skinny Timmy. [crowd cheering] - [Skyler] The appeal is everybody loves midget wrestling. I mean they really do. - [Men] Midgets. - [Skyler] Here's the thing about using Extreme Midget Wrestling, we can use that and it's bold and it's to the point, you don't need any explanation, and it's the midget word, and that's gonna help sell. So on one point, it's a great thing. - [Reporter] Tell us what we're gonna see tonight? - If it ain't bolted down, somebody's getting hit with it, you get to see midgets flying around all shapes and sizes. - [Announcer] Tickets are available at Flavor Vapor, 32 East, Cherokee Avenue Downtown Mcalester. - [Skyler] On the second point, is Budweiser gonna sponsor us? Is Red Bull energy drink gonna sponsor us? No, because there's gonna be a little bit of friction there. There's gonna be somebody complaining, you know. - [Announcer] Dwarfanators. - [Skyler] On the other hand, if we go over here and we use Dwarfanators. Look at that word. It's brandable, not been used, it's new. We have no friction. And I'm a businessman. I wanna sell shows and sell tickets. So, I don't see it being a loss using Dwarfanators over Extreme Midget Wrestling, and I think we can sell the same amount of tickets, and I think we can have better sponsorships, make it like WWE and see what happens. But in America in 10 years, we're gonna have to change that word 'cause that's gonna be bad. Yeah, we got a few new guys out here now. That happens. I think the thing was is Kevin really rubbing the guys the wrong way. So, once I came back, got on the road, seeing what was going on, kind of realized that Kevin really needed to go, and all the guys came back. - [Kevin] Dammit! - [Skyler] And Rampage, Rampage is sitting out. - Somebody said I was fat. Someone say I'm overweight. They look fat theyselves. [crowd cheering] - [Skyler] Guys like Fabio, he went up to Canada and started working with some big guys and he ended up hurting his knee. He's doing some refereeing, lettin' the knee rehab a little bit longer, probably wrestling within a week or two. - Woo! - [Skyler] Nasty left, came back. - Selling out everything. - I turned my back on my childhood dream. Tried the real world jobs. You cannot perform at your best if you just don't like what you're doing. You just won't perform. So, I said, I can't retire. I gotta go back to what I was born to do. Politically correctness could have hurt the industry really bad, and wiped it out, but nothing gets wiped out totally. It can get down to the last molecule, and it'll start building itself back up, and that's what we've done today. [crowd cheering] - [Man] Old man, whoop his ass! - I miss the ring, I still miss the ring. I'll always miss the ring. What I miss the most in wrestling is the fans, the love, always. [upbeat music] - One, two, three. - [All] Dwarfanators! - [Announcer] Everybody give it up for Frenchy Lamont, he's been the wrestling world champion, WWE. - Wrestling is like a bad disease. [Frenchy laughs] It's like cancer. Once it's in you, you can't get it out. - [Skyler] Now we got an RV. We wanna make the guys more comfortable. We're gonna be touring in that. We're gonna have advertising on it. I think it will help the venues get more people to the show. When we drive in and it's a billboard. And, you know, we're excited about that. Being in business is kinda something that is in my blood. I'm a businessman, and I wanna continue running businesses. I can't say I've done everything right. I made huge mistakes. You get kicked in the teeth, people are gonna steal your money. Do you know what? I get back up and I keep trying. I follow the process. Process is not quitting. I think that's what makes you successful. I'm Skyler Ward, small business owner. [upbeat music] - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, don't ever call them little people!
