All gone. All gone. All my medicine is gone. Yeah, a whole bottle gone down your throat in one night. - You forget my heart trouble Mr Cascart. - I wish I could. Now listen to him, listen to him. Insults, insults, nothing but insults. The first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. What I have to bear from people. - What people have to bear from you. - I'm your stepmother. - You're not my stepmother. - What if I am? No real mother stand this. Good morning Muddy, shut up, Muddy. Good morning Cascart. Oh, shut up Cascart. Why you have to put somebody's name above ours? Who's Florianne anyhow? - Is this St. Moritz? - Certainly it's St. Moritz. Get out. - I don't believe it. - Here porter, take this. What's his number? Get his number so he can't steal anything. Put it on your own back old buzzard, to be sure no one will steal anything. Now you see what you've done? Can't you ever hold your tongue? - Step down and let the luggage get out. - Oh, we will fall. Oh, a gentleman at last. Oh, what a gentleman. - Oh, thank you monsieur. - Mademoiselle. Thank you. - Cascart, buy me an egg. - And where's that beer you promised me? I am Madame Ana√Øs Chardin, and this is Zaza, my stepdaughter... who was left with me as a mere infant when her father deserted us both. Oh, zut Muddy, he's not interested in that. What a name for me, Muddy. Which she called me before she was old enough to say Mother. Feels as if I've been more like a real mother than a stepmother to her... - Ah, shut up Muddy, go on, go on. - You have a bottle for me monsieur? Oh, the fleas you get on these trains. - Where's the Alcazar? - The Alcazar? Zaza, here's your breakfast. My partner Cascart, I'm going to sing there. - No, I don't know it. - You mean you've never heard of the Alcazar? - Possibly, but I'm a stranger here. - Oh, then you don't live in St. Moritz. No. - Been here long? - A week. Nice town? Well, when you don't know anybody and you nothing much to do any town seems dull. - Are you coming tonight? - I'm afraid not, I'm leaving for Paris. Oh, I'm sorry. - Hot, isn't it? - Very. - Well, good luck. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye madame. - Goodbye. Oh, there goes a gentleman. A gentleman, if there ever was one. - The same seat as usual monsieur? - Please. Merci. - Hello Dufresne. - Hello Bussy. Stop and have a drink with a nervous songwriter. You nervous, my dear Bussy? Why? We're rehearsing a few songs of mine after the show tonight. - What will you have? - Nothing, thanks. You've got plenty of time. Zaza isn't on for 20 minutes yet. But Zaza doesn't happen to be the whole show. All the same, ever since the show opened, you've dropped... in just before her number and left just after. - You noticed that? - Who hasn't? I've never seen you in her dressing room though. You come backstage and I'll introduce you to her any time you like. No thanks. You're an odd bird. You obviously admire the girl and yet you don't want to meet her. - What good would come of it? - You sound serious. So you're afraid of her. - Draw your own conclusions. - Alright, be mysterious, it's your loss. Good night. We got you back on time. - Not quite but it's alright. - How about supper later? - I don't know yet, I'll see, - Your fruit, mademoiselle. - Oh, my fruit. - Thank you. - And your bouquet mademoiselle. - Oh, my bouquet, thanks. And your fan, mademoiselle. Now, have I forgotten anything else? - This. - Oh, my gloves. No, I'll keep this and when I'm an old, old man, I'll take it out and look at it. Well, I don't think I'll have any use for this. No, no, no, no. The one who catches it can have it. Alright, come on. - Oh, no. - Hey, thank you. Bye. - Oh, Fouget. - Trying to impress the swells? Yes, I did. It's 15 minutes past nine, get in, get in. Come on, come, on. I know I'm late. But don't scold, I can get ready in 15 seconds. - You've been out front? - For a minute. - How's the house? - Full or will be by the time we get on. Did you notice anybody in particular? - Your admirer Marchand was there. - Oh, that pig. I didn't mean him. - Any swells? - You mean that fellow from Paris? - Oh, Du, Dufresne? - Yes, Du, Dufresne. - Is he out front? - I saw him buying a ticket. He's in his usual seat. I wonder what he's up to. - Oh, maybe he likes me. - Ah, don't fool yourself. If he liked you enough, he'd be on your track three weeks ago. Oh, and how do you know he's not on my track? He's slower than the rest then. He's never tried to meet you even. Maybe he needs encouragement. - He'll get it. - You bet he will. Get in, get in, get in, get in. Hello, Simone. - Hello. - Oh, Something is wrong with her. - Hey, 9:16 and a half. - All I need is 15 seconds. - Simone, Simone, what's the matter? - Nothing. Oh, you look like you need cheering up. How about a little drink, eh? - It wouldn't help. - Oh, come on, come on, I'm thirsty myself. Why don't you print the truth about your wonderful Zaza? - Instead of this sickly tommyrot, look. - Don't be jealous. - I, jealous? - Florianne, it's a show going on. I'll tell you why, because even low down newspapers like yours... aren't low down enough to print the truth about her. Why, look at that mother of hers. Now, now, that's only her stepmother. Of course, you stick up for her because she sings your songs. Shut up, shut up. - Am I right, sweetheart? - Yeah. Oh zut, it's too hot for a ride. Someday I'm really going to tell that one what I think of her. - Come on now, tell me all about it. - I've lost my job. - And I don't know what on earth to do. - Oh, you poor child. Well that's serious, I thought you were only crying over some man. But cheer up, you'll find something else. Where? When? Jobs aren't easy to get. I've my sister to think of and her having a little baby. - A baby? How old is it? - Two days. Oh, well you got to keep your job here, I'll speak to Malardot. - Here, you give this to your sister. - Oh, no. Don't be silly. What is it anyhow, a boy or a girl? - Girl. - A girl. Oh, you can't expect a girl two days old to support herself, can you? - Here. - Oh, thank you, mademoiselle. Champagne? Who, who's going to pay for that? - Mr. Marchand. - Oh, that's alright then. You see? It came just at the right moment. Here, here's to her. - Do I hear my darling Zaza's voice? - No, no, no, no... Don't scold, I can get ready in 15 seconds, here. Now, why don't you give this girl a part in your new review? Look at that. No, my audiences don't like sad faces. Smile for the manager. Now, look. You'll have to do better than that. Now go to your dressing room and practice smiling. - Be at rehearsal tonight. - Oh thank you, thank you. Rehearsal tonight? Why? Because I've written a new song especially for you, my darling Zaza. - My darling composer, sit down, sit down. - No, no, I'm going up front. Oh, to join your friend from Paris? What's his name? - Oh, Du, dufresne. - That's right. - Oh, I have a drink first, come on. - Drink? Why don't you bring him backstage sometime, eh? - Oh, that's what Florianne just asked me. - Florianne? Oh... No wonder that voice of hers doesn't drive him right out of the theater. - Well, I've got to see Zaza. - The protector of the star. Oh, the star... Yes sweetheart. Oh, don't be jealous, sweetheart. Goodbye sweetheart. Hello sweetheart, won't you pour a little one for me too, eh? Help yourself, I'm in a hurry. - Zaza. - What? - Please please be nice to Marchand. - Why? - Oh, he's not a bad fellow. - And he backs your shows, eh? - Yes and he owns the house. - And I sell it. So why should I be nice to him? - Look, I'm talking to you as a father. - Oh? Except for my own cellar, even the tsar of Russia hasn't got anything better. - No, nor the Emperor of China, eh? - No. You know how much that cost me? Guess. - Zaza. 9:22. - I know, I know. I'm getting dressed, see? Have you got all the men you need Zaza or shall I send in a fireman? No dear, keep him for yourself, if you can. You rascal. Oh, she would be just common enough to throw things. - You bet I would. - - Come on, come on. - I'll be ready. - I know in fifteen seconds, go on, go on. And come back here with that hat. - What? - I want to ask you a favor. Oh, so that's it, is that? Ask that friend of yours from Paris to come to the rehearsal tonight. Dufresne? Oh, he's no friend of mine, I've just met and talked a bit. I have offered him to come backstage but he always refuses to come. Oh, if he knows I want to meet him he won't refuse. - Well... - Now, now, fix it with him nice. - Alright, I'll try. - Go on. - Hello Nathalie. - At last. Oh, I see a pin pointing straight at me. - That's luck. - Come on now, be quick. No, be quiet while I make a wish. - Where's Jeannette? - There's Jeannette. - Oh Jeannette is full of wishes. - Jeannette is full of dirt. Well, maybe that doesn't keep her from bringing me luck. I found her out in a stack of trash one night... when Muddy sent me out in the street for some wood. She's my oldest friend this... She needs a little perfume. Shame to waste it on something like that considering how much it cost. Oh, she deserves it, if I wasn't lucky, I couldn't afford expensive perfumes. Sit down while I change. Yeah, we're lucky alright, Marseille wants us now and Vichy and Lyon. We're getting closer to the big money all the time. Oh dear old Cascart, you found me the same way I found Jeannette, didn't you? Just keep your head now baby and in no time I'll have you singing in Paris. - Paris? - Why not? You never been to Paris, have you? And you want to go, don't you? - Oh, I've dreamed about it. - You'll get there. Only don't give all your money to that old sponge. Now, you know I don't like you to talk about Muddy that way. Who would've taken care of me if she hadn't? Ah, I've heard all about that. And you've taken care of her ever since you've been big enough to sing on a... - street corner with a tin cup in your hand. - Zut, zut, zut. Learn that new song before the rehearsal tonight. Peek-a-boo. - Hello Muddy, - How are you dear? Can you say that auntie is pretty impress with the flowers tonight. Good evening madame Nathalie. Isn't my pet a sweet thing? Oh yeah, I'm sweet. Let me look in the mirror dear, I see I need a little rouge. - Zaza is got to hurry. - Take my shoes and stockings. Cascart is afraid I'll be late. Cascart? That so and so, if ever there was one, What would he be without me and my daughter? What would you and your daughter be without Cascart? He's an idiot, a nincompoop. - And he's trying to ruin you. - Ah... That costume, I don't like it. It makes your waist too big. Men admire a small waist in a woman. When I was your age, any man could span mine with his two hands. - Like this. - You wretch, you. Don't you know that's bad for my poor heart? Never mind, I know what's good for that poor heart. - Oh, I don't know what you mean. - No? Oh, that Cascart. Who does he think he is? Forget Cascart, tell me why you came here tonight. - Why, to see you. - And what else now? There was a matter of a small debt ma Cherie, I need 50 francs. 50 fra, no. - 40. - No. - 25. - Zaza... - No, don't Zaza me. - 30. - No. - Tell your fortune with the cards. Well, that's different. - Make a wish then. - I've made it, I've made it. Cut. - Well, do I get it or not? - 30 francs. - Oh, give it to her Nathalie. - Oh, I knew she'd get it. - My love, you get your wish. - I do? Give her forty Nathalie. Well, is he there? Of course he's there, isn't he there every night. He's there but not here. I'm having supper with him tonight, what do you say to that? - Why are you two arguing? - Oh, I'd say I don't believe you. - That was flat. - Flat? Why you... Just watch to see you take me to supper tonight, just watch. I will. Nathalie, you should've seen Florianne, I drove her crazy. - Are you busy? - Oh, Bussy, come in, come in, come in. Oh, there you are my darling, isn't Monsieur Bussy a handsome man Nathalie? Come in, come in, sit down. No, no, no, not there, here, closer. He always wears such smart clothes, doesn't he? Well, what a lot of nice things you're saying tonight. I always say nice things about you, don't I Nathalie? I always say you're not only a wonderful songwriter but a good friend too. - Well, thank you, you have one? - I haven't time. Oh but I adore your cigarettes. - Well, what about it? - What about what? - You promised to fix something up for me. - Oh yes, something with Dufresne, you mean. - Yeah. - No, he can't. He can't? No, he's catching the late train back to Paris. Now, about this song, I think it's a bit too good for a place like this. A bit above their heads, don't you think so? Well, whether we go with it or not, I think it's the best thing I've done yet. - Yeah... - Isn't that true? - Yeah... - What's the matter? You first you say a lot of nice things, then you don't say anything at all. You'll come and say something? Yes, I can say something, I haven't even looked at your old song. What? And if you think you ever wrote anything too good for anybody, you're crazy. - But you just... - You never have and you never will. - But why did you say... - I'm sick and... tired of trying to make something out of somebody's... songs that won't do anything for me. Oh, the light dawned. You're really gone on Dufresne, aren't you? Oh, that as silly as your song. Well, after all, there are plenty of nice fellows here in St. Moritz. Meaning you, I suppose, eh? Well, you like my clothes, you like my cigarettes, Listen, if you want me to like you and sing your song... - you'll bring Dufresne back to meet me. - But he's taking the train, I tell you, He couldn't spend more than 5 minutes with you at most. - Ready, mademoiselle? - Coming, coming, coming. If he spends 5 minutes with me, maybe he won't take the train. - Don't bet on that. - Why shouldn't I bet on it? Don't you think I can make a man change his plans? Yes well, I would but Dufresne, no. - You see? Fifteen seconds. - I wouldn't like to be hanging that long. ‚ô™ Little man, little man, when you're visiting the music hall ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If your eyes have a chance to roam, give a prop to a happy home. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Little man, little man, there's a lady at the music hall ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ With a smile and a big hello. ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Hello. ‚ô™ - Hello. - Shut up. ‚ô™ To fall in love with that one, no that one should rip your heart. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And it'll cost you a string of pearls, but there's plenty of other girls. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If she smiles at you sweetly, discreetly, my friends, we part. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ For the rest of your natural life you're a problem to your wife. ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ When someone not quite so gay. ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Little man, little man... ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I have your phone, you have my knees, I pray. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ To fall in love with that one, not that one should break your heart ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And it must be the next in line, who will make you go with mine. ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ To fall in love with that one, ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Not this one. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ She'll break your heart. She's too wise, she's too smart. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, if I tried like you, sweetly ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Discreetly I turn my eyes. She's too smart, she's too wise. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - My darling, I must be loved. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Lies, lies. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - I must be kissed. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Oh me, oh my, I must be on your list. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, don't say that to Zaza. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - For Zaza, there's only one. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Only one makes your life sublime. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Only one at a time. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - No, no, no. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Ah, ah, ah. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - No, no, no. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ - Ah, ah, ah. ‚ô™ - You're really gone on her, aren't you? - Isn't everyone? Then, for the love of heaven, why don't you come back and meet her? Meeting her is quite a different thing. Now, you can spare five minutes... out of your entire life in order to do a great artist a little favor. - I don't follow. - Well, it's like this. Zaza won't even rehearse my new song unless I bring you back to her dressing room tonight. - Nonsense, I don't believe you. - But it's true. And I promised her I'd bring you back just for 5 minutes before you take your train. I'm sorry, that's impossible. I might not even take the train if I spend 5 minutes with that girl. - This is really funny. - Why? - You're saying practically what she said. - What? That if you spent 5 minutes with her, you wouldn't want to take that train. - What? - She even bet on it. What? Oh, she likes you and she means to make you like her. Hang it, why did you have to tell me this? - What? - Well, that. I'm not going to risk it. Oh, don't be such a coward, I'll have a cab waiting at the stage... door to take you safely on your way exactly 5 minutes after you've been introduced. No, my dear fellow, I'll be frank with you. Your Zaza attracts me too much. And I've a very good reason for preferring to... see her only from this side of the footlights. Such a meeting would be silly anyhow. All a great mistake. Rehearsal in 10 minutes, rehearsal in 10 minutes. Oh, having supper with Dufresne, eh? - Nathalie, Nathalie. - Yes madame. Get out and don't come back, even if I call you, don't come back. - What you up to anyhow? - Little flirting. I got to make a man change his mind about going to Paris... and make him take me out to supper instead, to prove to Florianne that he's asked me. Which he hasn't, yet. Get out. - Oh, hello darling. - Oh hello there darling. Monsieur Dufresne, mademoiselle Zaza. Please come in, it's not very grand but it's quieter than out there. - Thanks. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm glad to have the chance to tell you how much... I admire you as an artist mademoiselle Zaza. Oh, please sit down. - Oh, it's really no time. - Oh yes, just for a moment. Here, you can help me learn Bussy's new song, will you? Well, if I can. All you have to do is read the words to me, once or twice. - Just once or twice? - And I'll order your cab. Oh, would you? - Well, sit down and read me the words. - This is my debut, I'll do it badly. - Raindrops falling from the window pane... - Oh, it's funny. What? Oh, that day at the station when you lifted your hat your hair looked black... - and in this light it looks almost gold. - And in a better light, silver. Oh, so white hairs, eh? I like that. - Oh, but you have only three or four. - Oh, I should say ten at least. You really? Raindrops falling on a window pane, like a screen of Grey... You have a lovely voice. Let my lover dream of me again, sweetly through the day... Oh and such nice hands. Sun stop gleaming through the window pane. He's in slumber deep, high beyond the dark of night again. Let my lover sleep. Let me see the note. ‚ô™ Sun stop gleaming through the window pane. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ He's in slumber deep. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ High beyond the dark of night again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Let my lover sleep. ‚ô™ You're very clever mademoiselle Zaza. Clever? Oh dear, I hate clever women. But all kinds of women like you, don't they? - Of course not, why... - Oh, don't be modest, I know. There are men women can't leave alone and you're one of them. And there are men who can't leave women alone. - And you're one of those too. - You know a lot, don't you? About some things. - I must change my dress for the rehearsal. - I'll go. Oh no. Oh no, just a minute, Nathalie. Nathalie. Nathalie, Nathalie. Nathalie. Oh. Oh. Stupid thing, I wonder where she's gone. - Shall I look? - Oh, no, no, you have to stay and help me. - Unfasten my dress. - What? - Do you mind? - Why, not at all. - Remember that day at the station? - Of course. Was funny seeing you up front that night, I thought you'd gone. - Well, I changed my mind. - Do you change it often? Never looked upon myself as a very strong character. Oh, you must've known all along I wanted to meet you. - Why, what's the matter? - Cut myself on a pin. Oh, that's bad. Oh, let me put some perfume on it, that will cure it. - You like that? - Very much. Oh, I think perfume is the most important thing in the world, don't you? - No, no, no... - Oh, let me kiss it and make it well. - Is that better? - Very much better. Now, look the other way while I get out of this, now... - Oh, zut. - Now what is it? That same pin scratched my shoulder, put some perfume on it for me? - I don't see the scratch. - There is one. Oh, put it all over. Oh, you didn't kiss it to make it well? No mademoiselle, I'm quite sure it'll get well without that. Well, will you at least give me that thing hanging there? Oh, you've got a little mole on the back of your neck, under your ear. - So I've been told. - So have I, look. Yes, what a coincidence. - I'm not boring you? - No, no, but... But you're just not interested in anything I have to say. - Oh, not interested. - Five minutes, rehearsal in five minutes. - Five minutes. - Oh please... Please. - Stay and have supper with me. - Sorry but I can't. You want us to go over with Bussy's song again or not? No, I can learn Bussy's trashy song by myself. Of course you can. Well, it's been a great pleasure, thanks. A great pleasure, well, for you maybe but not for me. You've given yourself airs I don't like ever since you came in here. - Really? - As if I were throwing myself at your head. I'm not used to throwing myself at anybody's head. And I'm not more interested in you than, than, than in Professor Remus. - Professor Remus? - The Human Ape. So don't get the idea you're something wonderful. And shut the door when you go out. - Stay out. - Ready Zaza? Hey, get up, come on, come on, rehearsal is starting. - Oh, I know it isn't starting, I got ears. - But you're not dressed. Am I supposed to get dressed without anyone to help me? - Where's Nathalie? - I don't know. You? I'll found her, Nathalie, Nathalie. - I hope you know the song. - No and I don't intend to. - Look here, you promised me to sing... - I'll sing it, I'll sing it. Though I think it's absolutely idiotic. - But idiotic? - Here she is. Oh, there you are, where on earth have you been all of this time? What's the matter with you? Have you been struck dumb? Why, you told me to get out and not come back. - What? - When that man was coming. - Oh, you're crazy, get out. - But you're not dressed. - No, I'm not going to get dressed. - You're not going to rehearse in that thing. If you don't like it, I won't rehearse at all. She'll rehearse. - Now, Zaza, don't get temperamental. - Ah, zut. - You know your cute answer, don't you? - Yeah. - When I say, who'll take me there? - Of, course I know. I rehearsed it twice. - I'm not an idiot, you know. - Then you enter up stage saying, I will. Now don't forget. Who'll take me there? I will. Sometimes I'm not sure whether you're an idiot or not. - I told you to get out. - I wouldn't stay if you paid me. - You too. - Oh. I saw Dufresne, leaving. Wait till Malardot hears about this. Oh... Oh, how wicked you were to make me wait so long. Who'll take me there? Did you think I could really leave you? Except to find you these. Oh darling. Oh, Zaza. - Where are these hands going to lead us? - No... Who'll take me there? - Who'll take me there, I said. - Zut, I will. Who'll take me there? I will. ‚ô™ I'll forget your tender kiss ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'll be brave after this ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'll say, hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You'll forbid the tears to slip ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You'll behave, bite your lip ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And say, hello, my darling, if we should... ‚ô™‚ô™ What is it? What's the matter now? I'm sorry but this is just the sort of thing you can't do. Well, I sing a hundred times better than your precious Zaza. Sure my dear, you have a beautiful voice. Anyhow, now that she's gone into retirement. - Well, look who's here. - Cascart, hello, hello. - Hello. - Hello. Well, where have you been keeping yourself for the past six months? Ask me how I've been keeping myself. After three, by the way, not six. - How's Zaza? - You tell me. Oh, you mean you haven't seen her either? I always knew she'd treat you badly. Girls like that have no gratitude. Nobody is good enough for her lately, except this Dufresne. Oh, I got no kick coming, I just wanted to work and she doesn't want to work. So what's the use arguing? What in heaven's name happened to that girl? - Happiness. - Where has happiness ever got anybody? Happiness is alright, the problem is it never lasts. She thinks hers will when she marries this fine gentleman. No matter where that leaves me in their act. After all, it was Cascart who made her success. Oh, I only wish I could get you to take me on. Cascart and Florianne, eh? How about it? Well, I got to put it up to Zaza once more before I could say yes or no. But this great romance with Dufresne is taking all her time. It won't take it so long, I know how to stop it. - How long? - Oh, why haven't you stopped it before then? Well, for one thing, I didn't know then what I know now. - About him. - Oh, something about another woman, eh? - I didn't say that. - Oh, let's have a drink. You always did worry a lot about Zaza, didn't you? Yeah, they made some girl a good mother, I guess. Oh, Cascart... Tell me, is this fellow mixed up with some other woman? Zaza is not the only one. Tell her, it'll kill her but it'll cure her. I'd hate to hurt the girl. If she'd only be sensible, I won't be the one to tell her anything against him. Something will have to be done before this week is out. Something will be, nobody can go on living in a fool's paradise forever. What is it? I'm trying to make you pay some attention to what I'm saying. I've been listening to every word you said. Oh, no, no, you're that way half the time. I'd like to know what you've got on your mind. - I'll tell you. - Oh, no, no, no, no. If it's anything about going away I, I can't bear to waste... time thinking about unpleasant things when we're together. Neither can I, it's not long before my train leaves. Oh, that train, it's always leaving and taking you away from me. - And bringing me back. - Oh, it never takes me to Paris with you. Of course not, how could I attend to business with you in Paris? Oh, I know, I can't be bothered with Cascart's contract when you're here. That's another thing that worries me, I interfere with your work. - Why shouldn't you? - Because I've no right to. I've a very bad conscience my darling. Because you're going to America next month. Because I should've gone weeks ago, as you know. - If I thought you were tired of me... - Tired of you? I could never be tired of you. But if I don't go at once I shall miss my train. I'll die if you go to America. - That's very sweet. - I will, I feel it. No, don't go. Zaza, be reasonable. Oh, if I were reasonable, I wouldn't be in love this way. Nor I. - Why you have to go to America anyhow? - Business, money. Oh, business, money, business, money, that's all men think of. I haven't thought much of either the last few months. - Take me to America with you. - It can't be done. I must stop at my hotel to pick up my valise. Aren't you hungry? Let's have something to eat. No. - Make me go, put me out alright? - Why? I shall miss my train, then I won't be back so soon. Nathalie. Nathalie. - You needn't shout. I have ears. - Then why don't you come? Put your shoes on and run and get monsieur a cab. - Been waiting for ten minutes already. - Well, bring his hat and coat quick. Poor Nathalie. I wish I could make her rich for all the trouble I put her through. You too, my dear. Don't say such things. - Just love me. - I do. - I do... - Here you are. No, I said bring it, I'll hold it myself. Oh, isn't he a handsome man Nathalie? - Yes, a real beauty, eh? - Not too bad. Oh, you both like to tease me. You see how far apart his eyes are? - That means you can trust him. - Oh, does it? Only I wouldn't, were there any women about. - Go away. - Not much time for goodbyeing. Wait, wait. Nathalie. Nathalie, I'm going to drive to the station with him. Kisses weren't made to say goodbye, really. Come with me. What? Like this? Why not? You can take the late train back somewhere along the way. - Oh no, aren't you being very extravagant? - Of course. Oh, but how chic. Oh, I've never seen anything so swell. It's so clean. Oh, thank you, thank you. You child, is it really please you so much to be riding in the Salon Deluxe? To be riding in it with you. Oh, how lovely. I bet there isn't a flea in the place. Oh look, the moon running along with us. Hello, what's this? Muddy and my old Cascart with their heads together? And no furniture broken? Oh, monsieur Cascart and I had our little tiffs, who hasn't? But I've always known he had your interest... at heart, which is more than you'd say about every man. You've changed your tune Muddy. Oh, I smell something good. Changed my tune nothing, I've always admired Monsieur Cascart. I was saying only yesterday to that poor dear fellow... who's so much in love with you, Monsieur Marchand... Oh, don't mention that I am. - Telling him how glad I am... - Hello Nathalie. My dear child I'm in good old terms with a dear old friend. Oh, we got onions too, haven't we? Sit down Muddy, here. Sit down if you want some Cascart. Go on with it Cascart, give her a bit of that. - Here it is, Marseille wants us. - Marseille? That's too far. Well, then here's an offer to go back to the Alcazar. Oh, the Alcazar... too near. What's this, girl too far too near. Make sense, girl. - I don't want to go back to the Alcazar. - Oh, why not? Oh, I know too many people there. Zaza this and Zaza that and Zaza, come to supper... - Oh, it looks good Nathalie. - Oh, I hear you've been jaunting to Paris. Not quite. Well, it tastes good too. - In that getup? - Yes. Somebody had money to throw away on train riding. - Have some soup Cascart. - I'm not even able to pay my rent. The rent? I, I sent the money by Nathalie yesterday. Yes and not a penny less. Oh, Muddy I, I haven't the money I used to spare nowadays; Oh, that what's breaking my heart, there be money enough for... us all if it weren't for this Dufresne. Fetch me a cigarette Nathalie. - Sit down, take something. - All this has taken away my appetite. You bet it's like old times, this one money, that one contracts. Work, raw... There goes your best friend. ‚ô™ Is there ‚ô™ Is this as good as I think it is or not? Florianne, running it over yesterday. ‚ô™ I'll say hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ Is much too fast, take it slower. ‚ô™ You'll forbid the tears to slip ‚ô™ - You'll behave... ‚ô™ - Florianne, she thinks she can sing that. ‚ô™ Bite your lip ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'll say hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we do meet again... ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How can that moment be for you. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Sweet again? ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Go, my love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, it's a bitter world, I know, my love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, my love ‚ô™ - Oh, God, it's a silly song. - Go on. Just say hello, my darling, if we should meet again? Either you're in love or you're not in love, you certainly don't say... Hello, my darling, that way, if you are... or if you're not. Naturally you feel that way about it because you're in love. When do you think all of this is going to end? As for me, I wouldn't care if I never walked on a stage again. I'd be satisfied to put you where you belong. But how can I help you when you don't think of yourself? I am thinking of myself Cascart, for the first time in my life. I've seen you head over heels before. Only a few weeks, the cream was off the milk. And that's how this will be, only one of these days the milk will be sour. Cascart, when you talk about love... you talk like, like a blind man about colors he's never see. That's how I was too until all this happened. If only you knew how wonderful he is, how, how much he knows, how kind, how... how much he loves me. And how proud I am because he loves me. It can't last. - Why not? - Not forever. No? - So much the worse for me then. - Be sensible, what can you hope for? - Then, it might go on as long as I live. - What? Well, I can hope for that at least, can't I? Nathalie tells me he's planning to leave for America already. - Yes, for a few months. - Maybe you've some idea of going with him. - If I could make him take me, I would. - I see, and ditch our act. By heaven, you deserve to be told a few things and I'm going to tell them. What you know about this man anyhow? Do you know what takes him to America? Or where he comes from? Or where he goes to after he leaves you? Or... whether he's married or not? Married? Oh, married? Oh no, Cascart, that much I do know. He's not married, you can take my word for that. How do you know? Oh, I'm not a baby, for the last 4 months he spent 5 days out of every 7 with me. He's not the sort of man whose wife would let him do that. Oh no. He's mine, all mine, so don't make me laugh. I tell you, if he's not married he might as well be. What? I say this, someone in Paris. I know there is. How do you know? Tell me. - Don't take it like that. - How do you know, I said. What do you know? I saw him myself. - When? - Last week. - Where? - In Paris, at a theater. You saw him? In Paris? - With a woman? - Yes, she was a real lady. And they acted very open. And on their way out, arm in arm, when they were as close to me as you are now... I heard her say, before going home, I'd like a cup of chocolate dear. Look here Zaza, if she was just some girl, I wouldn't have mentioned it. Thank you. His wife? Oh, no, no, no, that's impossible. I've heard the worst women in Paris try to look like ladies nowadays. Some woman who's still in love with him, someone that he can't get rid of. He's kind, he hates hurting anybody. - What she look like? - Pretty? - But getting on. - No, young. Young? - Thin? - No, a nice figure. She asked for chocolate? Yeah, that's what most respectable ladies drink late at night, you know. Chocolate? Chocolate? And you've known this for a week and you didn't tell me. - What could you have done? - What could I have done? - I could have had it out with him. - But suppose she isn't his wife? - Oh, don't talk rot. - Who's breaking the... Oh, what would I do? What would I do. Keep more calm pet, whatever it is. Oh Nathalie... He said he saw M. Dufresne with a woman. All the same, nobody could think more of you than he does. Oh, yes, that's true, isn't it? I'm not surprised, he never looked frank to me, his eyes were too close together. That's a lie. They're not. After all, what's there to get so upset about? You defend him? Oh, that's just like all men. They always stick together. - But you're not his wife. - Exactly. He didn't have to deceive me. He could've told me who that woman was and why he had to see her. Never mind dear, you and I still have each other. Why did he have to be such a coward and left me to find it out from someone else? That wasn't fair, a bad dream. - Now you realize he's a scamp, I hope. - And a good one. - And a liar. - Yes, he's a liar. - And that you must leave him. - Never. - End it now Zaza. - Never, I said, never in the world. But, my child, your dignity. My dignity? My dignity, when did I ever have any dignity? Come on Nathalie, get me something to put on. - What's this? What are you going to do? - I'll know after I've seen him. - You're going to see him? - Certainly I'm going to see him. You don't thing I could sleep or eat or live another day without knowing the truth. - Come, come, wait and let him explain. - Zut. He told me not to say zut but I'll say it now. I'll say it to him and I'll say it to her. Zut. Zut. Zut. Chocolate, zut. I'll poison that chocolate for them, you'll see. He'll give up his chocolate with her or he'll give me up and he can't do that I know. Get your things Nathalie, we're going to Paris. Paris? You've just been, what's happened to that girl? - Oh, so that's where you keep the money. - Leave that alone. Where's my purse Nathalie? Hold on to it. And you, give me that bottle you've always got around. - No. - Give it to me, I said. - Zaza, don't be a fool. - Get out of my way. - What you going to do? - Drive around his house. If he can't get rid of her, if he's too soft. I'm not. I'll give her chocolate. There. It's done. - Madame Lavalle. - Come in please. Madame had to go out but left word you're to wait please. You are the Madame Lavalle who is expected, aren't you? Yes. Yes, that's right. Come on. Will you wait here please? Cascart was right, there's a woman here. - Madame had to go out, you heard that. - Yes, and she's coming back any minute. - Well, I'm ready for her. - But if he's with her or pops in first? Well, if he does, I, I... - I'll see, I'll see. - You're worried too. Of course I'm worried, or I wouldn't be here. - Men hate women who make trouble for them. - Women love men who make trouble for them. That's funny. So this is where he lives? Where she lived. Oh Nathalie... It does something silly to me just being here where they've been together. - It's a pretty place, - Prettier than mine. - Too pretty. - Why? It's been fixed up by a woman, even if I didn't know that, I'd feel it and see it. Is this a bachelor apartment? A piano. It's not his, he can't play a note. She's the musical one. Even the little corners have been arranged by a woman and a woman in love. When he comes to Paris, this is where they have their chocolate. Well, if she likes music, wait until she hears the tune I'll... - play for her, she can dance to that. - Stop all this. What on earth are you going to say to her? How do I know, I haven't rehearsed any speeches. I'll say, I'll say alright, have your nice furniture, make everything... pretty and comfortable and he'll leave it all and come to me. Even if the place where I live is ugly and dirty. You know it's dirty and badly furnished and badly kept. Every day I tell you it ought to be cleaner. Oh but it doesn't matter. You see all this? All this knickknack, these curtains, you know what they mean? They mean it's me he prefers and between the two of us it's me he'll choose. If you're so sure of that, why did you come? What kind of a woman can she be anyway? Gosh, I guess she knows how to keep house, you've got to admit that. Look how spick and span everything is. She must be a terror for cleanliness, that woman. - She's not only fussy, she's old. - That isn't what Cascart said. O, Cascart, Cascart say anything, he's afraid I'd get married and leave him in the lurch. If she wasn't old, why did he leave her so much? And why would she hang on to a man who leaves her all the time? Oh, I know all the signs, she's old and... Nathalie... - What is it now? - There's... there's a letter there addressed to Madame Bernard Dufresne. - Then he is married. - No, I don't believe it. Naturally she'd call herself that... - You're not going to read it. - I've got to know. You and your husband to lunch with us at... She's his wife alright. - Cascart was right. - Come, let's go now. No, no. He's got to say whether he wants her or me. There's someone coming, come along, come. I didn't know anybody was here. I'm going to practice my music lesson. - What's your name? - Antoinette Dufresne. What's yours madame? What? My name? My name is Lavalle. Oh, no. I know Madame Lavalle very well, we met when we were in Algiers. And she's not at all like you. - So, hear... - Yes? You were in Algiers last month with your mother? Yes, Algiers is where my grandmother lives. She was very ill and mama and I were there all summer. - We just came back two weeks ago. - Oh, I see. Why you keep looking at me like that? - Because you, you look like someone I now. - I look like my father. Here he is. And here's mama. - Is that your mother? - Yes. Shall I show you the beautiful new book papa just gave me? - A book? - Yes, I'll get it. A child. With a child, then it's something else. This is the nicest book I've ever had. We can both look at it if you sit here. Oh please, it's full of pictures. - You don't mind if I put it on your lap? - No. That's Sister O'Kree. And that's the mermaid. And that's the Little Match Girl, she's my favorite story. - Is she? - Yes. She didn't even have a name or any warm coat. She had to go out in the streets like that. Even on Christmas Eve when it was snowing to sell matches. Wasn't that sad? If you only knew how sad Antoinette. Well, she had no mama, only a cruel father who beat her. And at Christmas night she was afraid to go home because she hadn't sold any matches. So she hid in the doorway and lighted her matches one by one to warm her hands by. Oh, but don't feel so badly, it's not really true. There never was any Little Match Girl. - But there are children like that, I know. - Children who are really hungry? - Hungry and worse. - Have you any children madame? No. I'm sorry, you'd love them very much, wouldn't you? Yes, as much as your father loves you. He must think the sun rises and sets in you. Yes, everyone says he spoils me. He took mama and me yesterday to see the trained dogs and cats. It's so funny, they made us all laugh. And next month he's taking us to America with him. He's taking you to Am... - Your mother is going to America with him? - Of course. She didn't like even being in Algiers without him. And I'm always broken-hearted. Even when he leaves us for a week. You're crying, please don't. - Would you like my handkerchief? - No, it's alright Antoinette, no. Not Antoinette, Toto. The people I like always call me Toto. You like me? Honestly? Yes, because you have no little girl of your own. - Hello Toto. - That's mama. Mama... this lady is been waiting for you. Pardon me madame. No madame, there's a mistake. Evidently we came to the wrong apartment. But I'm not sorry, I met your little girl. You must be very proud of her madame. - You and her father. - Of course. Very proud and very happy. Please forgive the intrusion. Goodbye madame. Goodbye. - Goodbye Toto. - Goodbye. Yes, yes, my friend, all women are fools. We women are all sentiment, all fools. Until we find ourselves deceived, then we wake up and do something about it. When I found out that Zaza's father, to whom I was properly married... mind you, had deceived me, that man whom I adored, I cracked him on the head. - And what did he do? - He cracked me back. And before I came to my senses, he'd walked out. And from that day to this I have never seen him again. He not only left me, he left Zaza. His child by another woman for me to take care of. But, that's the reason I am the woman I am today. A fig for fine sentiment, a fig for true love, I'd say. I tell you Zaza be a... different girl from now on after finding out this Dufresne's false nature. She'll appreciate a man of your worth. You think so? Yes, certainly or I wouldn't have sent for you. And tonight I'll give her these beautiful things and tell her they came from you. And tomorrow she'll send for you herself, you'll see. If she does, I'll make it easy for the both of you from now on old girl. You know how to please a woman my boy. I'll take her around as soon as you go. She comes back at the 10 o'clock train... and we'll strike by the iron tracks. - Listen. - What? Oh, there she is now, mercy. She'll know we had our heads together and she don't like conniving. Here, step outside and run up the stairs so you won't meet her, here. Alright, alright, but she's blasty particular. Run up the stairs, goodbye. Mon Dieu. Mon Dieu. Oh Muddy. Hello pet. How tired we look. Well? Oh, Muddy, I'm so unhappy. Oh, so Cascart was right. You found him out, eh? That's not what I want to talk about now. I... I want to tell you how sorry I am for you. Sorry? Sorry for me? You better keep your sympathies for yourself, my girl. No, I've been thinking and I've never thought about it before. How hard it was for you to be left all alone with a child not even your own. No one to help you, no one to take care of you. Poor Muddy. Zut, girl, I'm not complaining and you shouldn't either. Do you suppose I'd like to be back on the farm, working for that... father of yours with maybe a dozen kids by this time? No, no. Your mother is a sensible woman Zaza. And I hope you'll be just as sensible... now and sweep out this fellow who can do nothing for you for one who can. Wouldn't you like a drop of something, child? I wouldn't want anyone to see you looking like that, you might be fifty. - Who'll see me tonight? - Oh, one never knows who's about. Now who do you think was here not more than an hour ago? And why do you think he came? To bring you these. They're real diamonds dear. They cost 3,500 francs. Marchand? Yes, indeed it was Marchand, that man is a model of constancy. - Oh, what a fool I am. - I always said so. Fine sentiments will get a girl nowhere. Yeah, nowhere at all, you're right. Good night, Muddy. - Wait. - No, good night. - But I said wait. - If I do, you'll wish I hadn't. - But these. - Oh, throw it at his face. - What? - Tell him to hang it in his own ears. Zaza, Zaza... Now you know everything that I know or she knows. Except that I heard her walking floors all hours all night. - I didn't sleep too good myself. - Go and speak to her. - Should I? - Yes, go on. - She oughtn't to be alone. - You're right. Hello Cascart. - It looks as though your heart was broken. - Oh, come, come, come. You'll cry your eyes out over a dozen worse fellows yet. Don't tease me, not yet. - Just advise me. - You know you won't take my advice. Yes, I will. I must, you're my only friend. I'll do anything you tell me to do. Well, what you ought to do is forget your troubles, get down to business. And get to be the big star I always wanted you to be. You see, it's hopeless, I could fight against her but not the child. - Not that child. - I'm glad you realize that. - What am I going to do? - There's only one thing, give him up. It's the only thing you can do. Telegram. - He's coming to dinner this evening. - You're not going to see him. But I must. I must. Now tell me, what did you do in Paris? Well, I saw to things generally, my steamship ticket in particular. - But in the evening? - The first evening I went to the circus. Saw some very remarkable cats and dogs. - And the next? Where did you go last night? - To the theater. - With friends? - With one. - And afterward? - I went home. But you had a cup of chocolate first. Yes, why not? And when you go to America, is this friend going too? Zaza, come now, be reasonable. You've known for weeks I was going. Yes... But not with your wife. Then you know. No, take it back and shut the door, no one wants anything. Yes, I know you're married. Why didn't you tell me? If I'd known you weren't free I wouldn't have let my heart run away with my head like this. Before you came I was gay, I had fun, my life was what it was and I saw no harm in it. Now it's all changed. I can't go back to that, I can't. Not after I'd known you and loved you and... even dreamed of marrying you and having children someday. If you'd warned me, I wouldn't have loved you that way. I'd have never had this impossible dream. We shouldn't have met, I knew it all the time. I thought it would be a mistake and tried to avoid it. But that's not an excuse, there's no excuse for me. I was drawn to you, we did meet... I loved you. And when I tried to tell you the truth the words simply wouldn't come. It was always so much easier to say something I thought you'd like to hear. But I will say this for myself, I'm not a man who's used to lies. That's why I'm not sorry you know at last. Only I wish to heaven you you'd had the luck to care for a different man. Rugs. - Fine rugs. - Rugs, rugs.. And some brandy, bring me another brandy. - Are your rugs the rugs, my man? - Oh, yes madame, the real thing madame. Let me look at them. I am Madame Anais Chardin, mother of Mademoiselle Zaza, star of the Follies de Paris, queen of revue, artiste the world over. - How much is that rug? - This? Oh, this is my most fine madame. I don't like to part with her but 1,000 francs. With the compliments of the gentleman over there madame. - Oh, an admirer. - Yes. - Where? - Over there madame. - Who is this man? You know him? - No madame. Face seems familiar, very good brandy. - You remember me mademoiselle? - No, I can't say I do. - Last time we met was three years ago. - Oh. That night Mademoiselle Zaza came back to St. Moritz from Paris. - Oh yes, it's beginning to come back. - But you recall the earrings. - Yes, I still wear them occasionally. - But they were for her. Those little diamonds for her? Don't you realize monsieur, that my daughter is a big star, the biggest in Paris? - And she wears only big diamonds. - She didn't wear big diamonds then. Her own fault, she could've had diamonds from dukes. However, if you'd like to send her a little memento, I'll see she gets it. What sort of memento? One of these rugs, for instance. The man has quite a nice one, costing only 1,000 francs, a bagatelle. 1,000 francs? Mademoiselle Zaza must be used to very fine things these days. The best, my daughter wants only the best, we'll take that nice one. - Who shall I say sent it? - Who? Yes, yes, your name. I've forgotten your name dear. - Then send it yourself. - But I, I will. Take it to Mademoiselle Zaza at the theater and say it's a little present from Muddy. Also the bill. Gentlemen of the press, exactly three years ago tonight... you hailed Mademoiselle Zaza the latest idol of Paris. And, as her manager, it seemed fitting for me to invite you... to inv... Hang it, where's my speech? Hang it, where are my pockets? I don't know where your pockets are but here's your speech. As Mademoiselle Zaza herself would tell you... There they are, open up. Fine. Here's present for Mademoiselle Zaza, also bill, 1,000 francs please. - Get out, get out. - But the lady send... I know all about that lady and her presents, get out I said. - 1,000 francs, it's very cheap. - I'll give you 100. - No, no, right, it's yours. - There. - Thank you, goodbye, goodbye... - Get out. Gentlemen of the press... - exactly three years... - More flowers for Mademoiselle Zaza. - You hailed Mademoiselle Zaza... - And the gentleman from the newspapers here. - Fine, show them in. - Look. Five roses, eh? - Dufresne, after nearly four years. - I hoped she'd never hear from him. - So did I. - But he can't see her, I'll leave word. - Throw them away. - Oh, I'd hate to do that. Nathalie, am I get crazy or dreaming? - He's here. - What? He's out there somewhere, I heard his laugh. You're imagining things. Well, perhaps. Only I... - Oh, mademoiselle. - Good evening messieurs... - My dear Fouget. - Lovelier than ever. - We'll all drink to your success, my dear. - We hope it goes on forever. Oh, so do I. - And now gentlemen of the... - Nathalie, my stockings please. I hope you don't mind, I've got to make a change. - My, what's to change? - I'll change jobs with you, Nathalie. - Gentlemen of the press, exactly 3 years... - Oh, wait a minute. - Here someone I haven't met before. - My nephew Henri. How do you do? Are you a journalist too? Well, I know where I could get an article about you printed if... if I could write something new about you, not the usual stuff that they're always writing. And now gentlemen of the press. Exactly... Something, something new? Nonsense, everybody wants to know the same thing. How she got where she is, ask her that. Oh, it's an old question but she may have a new answer. No, I've read them all, it's always the same thing. Work, defeat, despair, and, oh, yes, a broken heart. Is that true mademoiselle? Was your heart broken? Of course... Of course. But besides that, I had a very good friend, my manager Cascart. Oh and Jeannette, I must show you Jeannette, Nathalie. There. He made me work, told me what to do and she brought me luck. - Now you must excuse me, I must change. - We'll go out front. You must hear her new song, it's simply wonderful. Where did this come from? Oh, some flowers, I suppose. It certainly didn't grow here. - A gentleman to see Mademoiselle Zaza. - Tell him she's busy. Let me see that card. I'll tell you why this girl got where she is gentlemen. When she knew the right thing to do, she always did it. I'd say you had character Zaza. I'm not so sure. - Au revoir messieurs. - Au revoir. I may be wrong but I still believe you know how to think straight and act right. Ready mademoiselle Zaza. Will you play Hello, My Darling. ‚ô™ I'll forget your tender kiss ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'll be brave after this ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I'll say hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You forbid the tears to slip ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You'll behave, bite your lip ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And say hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we do meet again ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How can that moment of delight ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Be sweet again? ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, my love, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Though it's a bitter world, I know, my love, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Go, my love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But please, remember not to sigh. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Over this last goodbye. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Just say hello, my darling ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ If we should meet again. ‚ô™
