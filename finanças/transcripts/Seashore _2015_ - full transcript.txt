Yes? Who? It's for Martin. He'll be there in a minute. - I thought you were going alone. - Tomaz is coming. - You know what to do, right? - Dad, I gotta go. No, no. He can wait. Take it seriously. We get there, do what we gotta do, and that's it, okay? Let's go. - Will you stay at his grandpa's? - No, at his parents. - His grandpa died. - Oh, that sucks. So it will be just you two and his parents? No, it's going to be just us there. - You two are staying alone? - Yeah. - Let's party, then? - Of course. - Can we go there tomorrow? - It's up to you. - So, let's go out tonight. - I'm so down. No way, I'm too tired. C'mon, go out with us. Alright, I'll check with Bento to see if he's up to it. - Who's Bento? - Bento... is the guy who's picking me up. I told you about him. - Is he your boyfriend? - No, he's not my boyfriend. Come with us, then. I'll see what I can do. - See you, guys. - See you. - Good night. - Come by the house. I will. It's freezing out here. - Let's go? - Yeah, dude. I'm trying to think of a cool place for us to go. - Where? - I don't know yet. There's nothing to do in this town. Of course, look around us. - You're not running away. - Get off! - Faggot. - Animal. "Animal"? Don't you know how to curse? "Silly". Stinky. Sour dick. Hairy butt. Dude, does anyone come here to play mini-golf? Of course. Weekends are packed. Tons of kids screaming. - You know the rules, right? - Sort of. You have eight moves to get the ball into the hole. And each move is one point. Yeah. But you win by scoring less points. I used to think that the more points you scored, the better. But no, you need to score as few points as possible. Then I'd do eight points every time, hitting the ball away from the hole. I'd say "eight points, yay!" - Stupid. - I was only a kid. I might suck at mini-golf, but check me out at basketball. Hey, what the fuck are you doing there? Come back! Do you really want to go in? It could be fun, man. You're not backing out now, right? Are you afraid of women? - Good evening. - How's the party? Twenty five to get in. Three beers included. Is it okay? Okay, we want to come in. - ID. - Sure. It's torn. It's not worth anything. C'mon, dude, it's the only ID I have. We can get in everywhere in Porto Alegre with that. But not here. Dude, let's go. - He was about to let us in. - No, he wasn't. Let's go home. Give me five minutes, I'll go inside and I'll be right back, I just want to check the place out. - Seriously? - Five minutes. I'll be right back. I mean it. I'll be right back. Where did you get that sandwich? I bought it at this bakery around the corner. - Dude... - It's cool, dude. I mean it. Dude, pause it. Hi, Dad. Yeah, we got here okay. No, not yet. But I'll go. Tomaz is taking me there. Okay, Dad. Okay. What time should we go to your grandpa's? In a bit. You want me to come with you, or would you rather go alone? You can come with me. Let's get back to the game. Play the next one by yourself. - Hi, excuse me. - Yes? - Are you Mrs. Marisa? - Who would like to know? I'm Martin. I called you yesterday. I'm Lucio's son. No one here has anything to do with Lucio. He said you have a document for him, that's why I'm here. Which document? Rosa, go and get a glass of water for the boy. Which document? If you want, I can call him. You can talk directly to him... and he'll explain. No one's going to talk to your father on the phone. And why didn't he come? He sent you, is that it? Can I go to the restroom? Over here. I got stuck. Yeah. And where is your dad? Why didn't he come? I don't know, he was working. - You really don't wanna talk to him? - No. And let him know that if he wants to take our money, he should come here himself, you understand? Do you understand me? I don't know what to do. Come back with your father, boy. We need to talk to him. So? How did it go? A total shit. Hey. We could go for a walk on the beach. It's a bit cold, huh? Whatever. And I'm not really into beach. Martin, your house is in front of the beach. Once, I went for a walk by myself. And at some point I got lost. Completely lost. I walked for hours trying to find my way home. I don't even know how long, but in my mind it took a fucking long time, that's how lost I was. Maybe it was only for a few minutes. At some point, I was found by lifeguards. And I couldn't tell them which way my house was. They raised one of those blue flags for when they find lost children. - I didn't know there was such a thing. - There is. There I was, at the lifeguard booth, feeling as if I owned the sea. At some point, my dad showed up, screaming... when I saw him, I froze. You know what he's like. I felt so embarrassed when he was dragging me to the car, the lifeguards were watching the whole scene. As soon as we got home, he beat me up really bad, probably the worst spanking I've ever got. - That sucks. - Yeah. He would only stop to yell at me, saying that I had let him down. I was grounded for almost the entire summer, and when I finally could go out, I was afraid I'd run into one of those lifeguards. You were only a child, you know. You won't let go of this drawing book. I'm back into drawing. - Can I see it? - No. But when I get better, I'll show you. And I remember us going to the bedroom and doing it, but I woke up the next day and I had no idea where I was. I looked at the ceiling and thought "this is not my room, how weird". It took me a while to put things into place, and suddenly I realized I was wet. I was like "oh, no". I looked down and I had pissed on the bed. There was this giant circle around me, and I was half wet and half dry. I just looked around the room and... the first thing that crossed my mind was "did I pee on her?" I could hear her speaking to a friend in the living room, and I thought "I'm going to jump out the window". It was on the ground floor, but the window was too small. So I just sat there thinking about what I should do. All of a sudden, I bursted out laughing, out of nerves. I just thought "maybe she woke up early... and I peed myself after she got out of bed". - Sure. - So I had pissed only on myself. I got out of the bedroom and ran into her, she had just taken a shower. - We'll have to buy more beer. - Okay. I'll ask Bento in a bit. Do you and Tomaz take all classes together? Yeah. So, which one of the girls are you going for? I don't know. I'm more into Luiza, but I haven't talked to Tomaz about it. Do you think Tomaz might be into Luiza? - Don't know. - Talk to him, then. - Shit, it's freezing. - Yeah. Wait a sec. Wanna smoke a joint? Don't you wanna smoke with everyone else? - Natalia doesn't like that I smoke. - I see. - Have a seat. - Okay. Want some beer? Hold this. Cheers. Have you two gone into the ocean over the weekend? - Of course not. It's fucking cold. - Don't be a fag. Right. - Here. - Cheers. - Do you surf? - Yeah. Since I was a kid. - I love surfing during the winter. - Really? Isn't it too cold? At the beginning. After a while, you get used to it. Yeah. And you? What have you been up to? Yeah. Okay, then. We'll talk again soon. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay, then. A big kiss to you. Bye. - Hey. Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. - Let's get going? - Let's, 'cause it's fucking cold. One minute left. Truth or dare? Dare! - No, c'mon. - It's gonna look beautiful. - You gotta do the eyebrows as well. - No, just the hair. Hair and eyebrows. - It's quite blue, already. - Aren't you cold, dude? I'm really fond of her. Martin's gonna play oral sex. - But it doesn't have a penis. - But someone here does. - May I have a kiss first? - You have to get in the mood. You have to take it out. - Truth or dare? - Okay, dare. Two minutes in heaven... with... Tomaz. - Really? - Really. Okay, then. Enjoy it. - Aren't you cold? - Never mind. Dude, come here a sec. - Do you have condoms? - Yeah. Hold on. Okay, thanks. Here. I'm too drunk for all of these. Take these back. Come here. Thanks. Go and fuck. Another? No, enough. I drank too much already. - Already? - So have you. You're spilling it all. Take it easy. I'm cool. I can see that. Do you guys come to the beach often? Last time I was here was ten years ago. Wow. - You have to come more often. - Sure. - But come during summer. Much better. - Okay. It's hard to enjoy the beach and meet people in the winter. Yeah, but that's not the reason why we came. We only came because Martin had to take care of some stuff. - Work stuff? - No, family business. I'm not sure. But I'm glad you two came. Yeah, I'm not so sure. I shouldn't even be here. I should be in Porto Alegre right now. - For what? - For a wedding. - Really? I love weddings. - Yeah, it's my cousin's wedding. She's my closest cousin, so my mom got pissed that I came. But whatever. Weddings are the best. Really. - She was right to be mad at you. - Yeah, maybe. But I had to come. It's nice that you want to solve other people's problems. Really nice. Yeah. He's my friend, right? Take off your pants. Let me help you. You can handle it from now on. I'll get you a towel. - Take good care of your friend. - I always do. - Bye. - Bye. Hey man, wake up. C'mon, Tomaz. Get up. Tomaz! - Can't remember much of last night. - It was really fun. Get up and take a look at the mirror. Oh, damn! - Dude, wait here. I'm going in. - Are you sure? - I am. - I'll be here. Martin. Give me a hand. Hold this for me. - Here? - Yeah, over there. - Where are you staying? - At my father's house. The house by the shore? I helped to build that house. You had a dog. What was his name? A yellow dog. - Duque? - Duque. How is he? He's dead already. Three or four years ago. That dog was beautiful. How was grandpa? - In his final days? - Bad. He had been sick for quite a while, you know. We were preparing ourselves for what was coming. I'm truly sorry, man. - What? - And Mrs. Marisa? How is she dealing? Hanging on, you know? She's hanging on as best as she can. Excuse me. May I join you? You still want that paper, right? And you don't even know why you're here. No. I haven't seen your father in almost ten years. Yeah, I don't have many memories of you either. You have grown a lot. - Tell your father to call me. - I told him. Rosa. Here it is. I should've come here more often. You're a grandson. Just like Rosa. This is his house. Well, it was. I feel like an intruder. And not because of who my father is. You're part of the family. I don't get this. How can the same movie be on, every single time? Your turn. You can come back whenever you want. - Where are you taking me? - Calm down, we're almost there. Hey, Tomaz. I can barely remember my grandpa. But I remember when he used to bring me here. That's shitty, you know? It's nice that everyone has time to deal with their own shit. Do you feel better now? I'm only a little hungover, but only a little. We've been here for two days and I already want to go back. Back to your boyfriend? He's not exactly my boyfriend. Have you two been dating for a while now? About three weeks, I guess. Cool. Is this the first time you've been with a guy? No. But it's the first time I'm actually caring about one. Dude, do you have a cigarette? You know you could have told me, right? I wanted to. But I didn't know how. You're a great guy, man. I went to my grandpa's. Even being his grandson, I felt weird. But when I left, when I was in the middle of the road... I didn't know which way my home was anymore. I didn't know if I should go to the house you had built... or go back to the one they were living in. I was sad. I thought of all the things I didn't get to do. Because I knew you wouldn't approve. I didn't get to feel what I was feeling. I didn't get to care about the people I cared about. I'm coming back to Porto Alegre without the document. There's people around me... who don't make me afraid to go to the beach. Even knowing that I might get lost... I'd rather take my chances. Man, did you fuck the girl last night? No. I got too drunk so I wouldn't have to do that. - Too bad for her. - Yeah, too bad. - I fucked Luisa. - I knew. I saw that. What do you mean? Bento knocked on the door asking for condoms. Then I ended up seeing you two here. So you were watching me naked here? No! - I bet you did, man. - I didn't, man, fuck you! - Of course you did. - Stop it, man. I bet you jerked off after that. No. If I wanted to jerk off, it would've been after I saw you getting out of the shower, naked. - You were watching me, man? - No, not at all. I was "dead", right? - Son of a bitch. - Stop it, dude. What a son of a bitch! - Quit the bullshit. - You're paying for it. Earlier today, when I was leaving my grandpa's house, was it your boyfriend on the phone? Yeah. But he's not my boyfriend. Good. You can't have a boyfriend before I approve of him. Oh, alright... Dude, I called my father and talked to him, I said everything I had to say. That's awesome. That's shitty, isn't it? Look, man... your father will never change who he is. Take your own ride. Yeah, you're right. Dude, I'm going to change the CD. Here. How does it feel to kiss a guy? I don't know. I like it. I know that. How come you had never noticed it before, man? You could've told me. It's different. You knew you liked guys even before being with one? But when I did it for the first time I knew for sure. I'll check if the beers are cold already.
