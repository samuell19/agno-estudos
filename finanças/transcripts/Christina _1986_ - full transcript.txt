I've prepared the souffl√© for your husband. - He'll be happy for this. Thank you. Go to sleep. I don't need you anymore. - Thank you. Good night. Good evening, my dear. - Hello, darling. You're late. Did you have a good day? - More or less. I'm very tired. It was a hard day. - Did the new surgeon arrive, yet? - Surgeon? You can call him a butcher. New doctors are unskilful because they don't have much experience. Just like the mechanics. The first engine they repair, they can't put together again. He didn't even know how to hold a scalpel. Well, what have you done today? - I've been pretty busy. First i played tennis. Then i went for a swim. I've made an appointment with flavia for a golf match. - Sounds good. But even though your handicap is better, you won't beat me. Doesn't matter as long as we have fun. You'll see. One day you'll be a gold master. You are fabulous. I have to sleep now. I have a surgery tomorrow. I allmost forgot to tell you: Andrea belsiani is coming for lunch. Belsiani? - I've saved his life a year ago, remember? He called because he wanted to see me. Usually, you don't meet your patients. Why him? I like him. He is a fairspoken young man. Ok. Sleep well. - You too. Yes, i was dying. And if your husband wouldn't have... - you're exaggerating! Your strong constitution helped you to survive. Iook at you now. You are a strong, goodlooking man in his best years. You should forget this accident. I am here to dispel my fear of reminding. Andrea told me that he has found a flat downtown. Well, interesting. What do you want to do? I design fashion. I'm working in a big studio. - Maybe you profit from it, christina? I hope so. He certainly is a good advisor. - I'm at your service. I owe you. - Stop this adulation. I'd rather look as you as a friend. Excuse me, but i've got to get back to work. Let's continue this conversation in our club on sunday. What do you think? Do you agree with that? That's wonderful. - Yes. Keep your seat. - Have a coffee with us. I'm sorry, darling. I've got to go. Excuse me for a moment. Do you have champagne? - Yes. - Well, serve it, please. - yes. Diego has to work a lot. - Do you feel ionely sometimes? No, i 'm always busy. Excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you, tina. You can go. Important encounters deserve the appropriate drink. You like to be proactive, don't you? Yes, but only if i'm sure. Let's drink to this encounter. - No, i have a better idea. Let's drink a toast to you. To your beautiful eyes... ...and to your beautiful body. I'd like to retire. I need some rest. - Just as you wish. We'll meet in our club on sunday. I'm looking forward to see you, christina. Goodbye. Excuse me. You know that you are my real love. I'm yearning for your body. I dream of you. I don't hope that flavia will find out. She would hate and despise us. - That's right. I love my husband and i've never been unfaithful to him. But there's this young man, andrea. You've met him this morning. I'm attracted to him. Judging by his look, he must be feeling the same for you. - Are you making fun of me? It was obvious, christina. Nice to see you. - Have a seat. - I wanted to recruit somebody new, but it's always the same. They don't have enough experience... hello, flavia. Josephine and christina are still in the locker room. They have won again. They'll become the clubs' best. This is andrea belsiani. He's a friend of us. - Miss. It's a pleasure. Could you order the usual, diego? - Of course. I'm sorry that i couldn't come. I have overslept. Professor. The clinic has called. Your assistent said that it was important. Excuse me, but duty calls. Alberto? - Yes? Could you get miss flavia a big portion of ice cream just like she prefers it. Tell christina that i had to go to the clinic. She can come home by taxi. - L'll drive her. - this is very nice, andrea. I don't want to impose on your kindness. - This is no problem. Have a nice day. Goodbye. Talk to christina about the next appointment. - I will. They are waiting for us. There you are. Christina. - I'm sorry, i left you waiting. - Where is diego? - the clinic has called. L'll take you home. - That's nice. Could we leave right away? - Of course. - Have a nice day. - goodbye. I didn't slip my attention, you little hussy. If i catch you one more time looking at a man like this, i split up with you. - We belong together. You are jealous again. You know that i don't like men. You have an nice car. Is it english? - That's right. They are very special. I love driving fast - as opposed to my husband. He hates it. Fantastic. Let's do it and let's keep it secret. Your husband doesn't have to know everything. I'm longing for your body. You're exciting. I want to be with you. Please, don't be afraid. That was a big mistake. - No, it would have been a mistake if we had not done it. I can't look into my husbands eyes anymore. I don't have to wait for you very often. I am happy to see you. I'm sorry. We've talked a lot and defied the time. Don't you give me a kiss? How was the surgery? Just routine. Not that grave as i expected. Diego? - Yes, darling? What do you think about going on holiday? - Holiday? I can't leave the clinic. We are fully booked. The clinic is all that counts for you. All i'm asking for is a small holiday together with you. Nothing more. I'd really like to do that. But in my position i can't do that. I carry great responsibility. As soon as possible we'll go. I promise. Just be patient, darling. I'm tired. I love you so much. I always want to be with you. Me, too. It's probably the best if you go to sleep. You're right. L'll go to bed. Do that. Honey? L'll be right with you. Don't let me wait too long. Hello, christina. My husband isn't at home. - I'm not here because of him. I want to be alone. I don't feel well. You won't notice me. It's interesting in this greenhouse. That's true. You may stay if you want. It must be great to be married to a wealthy man. - Andrea. Sometimes you are childish. I'm trying to imagine how it is to be a spoiled child. I grew up in a big mansion with a big garden. I have never been happy. I've felt ionely. Whenever it was possible... i jumped over the wall and ran to the kids playing on the streets. I liked them. My first love story was in the shadows of these walls. - It must have been horrible for you. No, it was truly deep relationship with the outside world. He told me many things about his friends, his dreams... ...and his secret adventures. I told him about my lessons, french, playing tennis and piano. - What happened? - We've never seen each other again. I grew up on the wrong side of the wall. Nothing could keep me at home. I was always on the move. We were some cheeky boys with crazy ideas. But we all grew up. Christina. Thank you. Hello, diego. - Hello, darling. Do you like our greenhouse? - Yes, the plants are great. - Andreajust wanted to leave. - Why don't you stay for lunch? - Thank you. - i thought we had lunch in the club? - Sure, why not. - l'll accompany you. Excuse me for a moment. - Of course. You seem to be making good progress. I've been watching you. Yes, it's good. The perfect place for a honeymoon trip is venice. - It is such a fascinating place that you can only indulge yourself in love. - Don't say that. That's embarrassing. - I didn't exepct this from you, maria. You're a grown up woman. Why don't you leave this sense of shame... ...to the girls? Generally, high society women are rather prudish. - What do you think about that? I think being prudish is the only way... ...to protect herself from her own emotions. Don't forget that a woman is subjected to many temptations. Well, christina, i think that a woman has got a temperate instinct. It's her goal to become pregnant. That's an underestimated task. - Carlo, don't be so canting and naive. Even though it is the male part to take the initiative during the mating ritual, the female does not necessarily stay passive. - For sure if she is a whore. What have i done starting this conversation? Why don't we stop advising and let the bridal pair learn for themselves. What is better than an intense relationship between two persons. Complete devotion and loyality of the woman for her man. The contact of two souls and two bodies that combine themselves... ...in harmony. That's what we expect in a marriage? You're right. Now let's drink a toast to their love stories. - Thank you all. I'm glad you all could come. Cheers. Let's drink a toast to us. - To us, darling. Andrea, i'm sorry that i need to ask you again for a favour. - Don't leave me alone again! I could show you my studio. - This is a good idea. Good. The dinner was delicious. Cheers. Charlotta, take the blue room. - Who is it? The conte au verdi? - Yes, try better this time. The last time he was not satisfied. - He is insatiable. - hello, andrea. I've been waiting for you. You've been away for 2 days! - Did you miss me? - You will always be a son of a bitch. Listen, there's a new client. - Very good. I've got the perfect woman. - Indeed? - can i get the special room? - Of course. - wonderful. Come with me. May i introduce you to francesca. It's a pleasure. I hope you like our collection. I'm looking forward to trying some. - Please, bring her to our private room. - sure. - L'll get you the latest collection. - thank you. I prefer something long-sleeved. - No problem. Just as you wish. It really looks like a room that is made for making love. Well, would this hamper you? I don't know how to say but... - what? Listen. I ask you for a little personal favour. What do you want? L'll be back in a minute. Why don't you take off your clothes? She has a wonderful body. - Don't push it too far. - L'll stick to my instructions. That's enough. You are new, aren't you? I didn't see you here before. You are not bad. Really. You're trying hard. Next time l'll ask for you. Ciao. How are you? Did you like it? You are disgusting. I've never met somebody like you. You've used me like a toy! - But you liked it, didn't you? I know that it turns you on making love to unknown people. Let's go. Come on. - This was the last time we've talked. Whatever you want. Christina! - Hello. Why are you here? - I wanted to be with you. I'm sorry but i have to make my round. L'll wait for you. What's the matter? - Nothing. Come on, darling. Don't fuss. You drive home now and wait for me. All right? Here you go. This evening we will spend our time together. Don't be late. - No. Is it already time, tina? - It's 12 o'clock. - Has somebody called for me? Your husband but he didn't want me to wake you up. Tell me if mr. Belsiani calls. - I will. Thank you. An unexpected visitor. Andrea. I am glad to see you. - Me too. Do you want to have a drink? - Thanks. Everything is allright? - Yes. Nothing to worry about. I just wanted to see you. Andrea, don't be such a flatterer. I must call the clinic. It's very important. Excuse me. - No problem. Christina, we must put things straight. - Really? It isn't as easy as you might think. Are you sure? You're so wonderful. - You too. You will be mine. - Please, don't... don't defend. Just enjoy it. I will show you. I'm sorry about that. Always the same. They don't know what to do without me. Cheers. We've been expecting you. Take a seat. - Andrea has called me. - Yes, we have got a new collection. An eccentric collection. I wanted to show it to you first. Everything is prepared. This way. - Where is andrea? - he'll be back in a minute. Pierra. Hello, my name is pierra. - Hello. You're beautiful. - Thank you. I think you are in the wrong room. No. Don't you like me? I understand. Help me to undress. Your girl friend is pretty good. It seems you start to like it? Didn't you want that? - Sure. L'll drive you home now. I don't want diego looking for you. Andrea. - Yes? - Come here. I want to talk to you. Not now. L'll take her home. - Carlotta can do this. We have several things to talk about. I'm sure it can wait until tomorrow. L'll take her home. Let's go. Francesca. The woman is back again and she wants to talk to andrea. I go and talk to her. Hello. We did not expect you today. I was passing by and i wanted to say hello to andrea. I'm sorry but he's not here, right now. From time to time he's visiting our clients. Maybe i can help you? - No, thank you. - Wait a second. We have a new client. I could imagine that you'd find him interesting. Well, i stay here. I am glad i could convince you. Our client will be very satisfied with you. Come with me. Make yourself comfortable. You are still dressed? What's up? You don't speak that much, do you? You seem to be rookie. A tad thin but beautiful. Now get undressed. I'm in a hurry. Show me what you've got. Are you jealous? That's not good for business, francesca. Don't forget that we've got a contract. - Really, even for her? You must confess that you're inferior. This woman means money. We have twice the turnover. She is from the high society. She does it with class. That's why you couldn't be found for days. This has nothing to do with it. I needed to prepare her. That's exactly what's bothering me. Allright, come with me. Iook at her doing it. What do you want to say? Your friend came on her own decision. I didn't force her to do it. - I told you that she's different. She likes it. - Yes. She wants to show you... ...that she is a decent woman. But when she feels unwatched she's behaving like a bitch. This is none of your business. You get your money the rest is up to me. I will not let it happen that some girl takes you away from me. Do you forget that i've admitted you? I even made you my partner. You jumble some things. This girl makes money. And i won't go without it just because you are jealous. Let me get one thing straight: You'll treat her better than the other girls. Understood? You are a very attractive woman. - Thank you. You're exciting. - Thank you. Moreover you've got a wonderful body. It is marvelous to make love to you. What do you think about my new hairstyle? - It is beautiful. I like changes. - Me too. Do you like me? - Yes. - Even if i look different today? I colored my hair. Do you prefer blond or brunette? This is hard to say. You're still a young girl. I can see that even if it looks different between your legs. Andrea! Aren't you happy to see me? No i'm not. - Why? I'm here just because of you. Listen, christina: This is a game and i make the rules. That's why you will do what i want. Understood? Carlotta. What's the matter? I want you to take care of business. L'll be away for some time. - Okay. Agreed. I will come only when you allow me to. Good, you will follow my instructions. - I love you. L'll do everything for you. What do you want more? Ciao. Andrea. - Yes? I can feel that you're in love with that girl. You didn't want to, but it happened. I'm not going to loose you to her. I love you. You are my everything. I fight for you. Forget her, andrea. Let her go and you get everything you want. We sell the house and kick the girls out. We sell everything and start a new life. - You shouldn't go too far. You're the owner of the whorehouse and i am just a partner. Darling! - There was a time when we were dependent on each other. Yes. That's right, andrea. I need you and i will never give you up. I don't allow you to leave me. You're right, francesca. Don't think about it anymore. Andrea. I hope that she was right on time? - Of course, she's already in the room. Everything is prepared. - Good. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, in the following race are thunderball, wildcat, julia b., firestorm, suke, shekter, rosalie and red panther. The jockey of firestorm is allan haves. The great talent we have seen last week... - very good. It's one of the most exciting races. - I love horses. I like this sport. - We should have gone to the racetrack. - Next time. - Professor. There's a phone call for you. - What a pitty, right now. The ground conditions are pretty poor after the rain. Thunderball is in the lead followed by wildcat... ...julia b. And firestorm. Sukes is falling back. Shekter, too. Yes, please? I must tell you something concerning your person. I'm sure it is of great interest for you. A man like you has pretty much to loose. I don't understand. I agree. We meet tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock in front of the park. L'll be there. - Excellent. Goodbye. Wildcat is still in the lead followed by firestorm, thunderball, suke, shekter. Rosalie and red panther already far behind. The distance is getting greater. On the final straight... ...wildcat is still in front of firestorm. Thunderball and suke are straight behind. Suddenly firestorm overtakes wildcat. Suke and shekter are straight behind. Getting faster from the outside. Firestorm is on top. Wildcat falls back on the third place. - I'm back. Suke is on the second place and firestorm crosses the finish line. - That's an exciting race. - Next time we'll go there together. We could also do a little betting. Do you have to go back to the clinic again? - No, they just needed some information. They are gambling for high stakes? - Yes, very high. You are a well-matched couple. Andrea is a young man but he knows exactly what he wants. It's not easy to resist him. - But i didn't mean andrea. What do you mean? Once in a while even women like us experience sexual lust... ...which needs to be satisfied. This is a normal behaviour. Andrea satisfies these women. He does everything for money. But money has never been important to me and andrea. But to andrea and your husband diego. What do you want to say? I thought you agreed that your husband watches you in the sexual act. What do you say? That's not true. What i do here is filthy and uncivilized. But diego has no idea what is going on. Are you sure about that? Andrea would even sell his soul... ...if he gets enough money. You still don't know him very well. Iook for yourself. My god, they are both involved. Now i understand. I did it for him because i loved him. He betrayed me. - I didn't do it on purpose. I thought you were part of the game. Andrea and me are together for more than 10 years. - I understand. I can't believe, that diego is a voyeur. He's multifaced. I underestimated him. The professor becomes more and more sympathic to me. Things are changing. Thank you, josephine. Funny, but i love him even more now. At the same time the love for andrea is getting weaker. I think it's just a physical thing. There's is a voyeur in all of us. Even i like to watch a couple making love. Take this christina. It will help you to relax. I show you how exciting it is to watch. I hope that you'll fall in love with me. Follow me. You're asking too much. I like you but... - don't talk. Just watch and enjoy it. Be quiet. We are a good team, christina. Nobody can beat us. You seem to have unusual good cards. Maybe you're cheating. We win. - Oh, no. - We're unbeatable. I hope that you're luckier than me, josephine. I must be successfull referring to my bad luck in love. But when i look at my cards i am the exception from the rule. Another game? - Let's stop. I don't want anymore. Good evening. - Good evening. Are you professor capi? - Exactly. I'd like to play tennis. Do you play with me? - It's a pleasure. - excuse us. We're outside. Ok, my darling. See you later. Professor, i don't feel very good. I feel so dizzy. Mostly in the morning. I recommend a physical investigation in my clinic. L'll call you for an appointment. You're getting prettier day by day. Hello diego! Long time no see! - Nice to see you! I'm very busy right now. What's the matter? Don't you like it anymore? - It is your husband. - he follows me. Don't worry about him. This time you'll get it for free. I can be generous if i want to. You know about diego? - Are you surprised? What do you want to do? Do you want vengeance? I wanted to, but i'm not interested anymore. Yes, andrea. I want it. Please do it. Your husband wants me to take you to the studio. I am at your disposal. What kind of man is it today? Christina, we can stop it any time if you want. L'll find a way to explain it to diego. - No, i like this game. I was told you were looking for me? - Yes. Listen up, boy. You get paid by me for my pleasure. I don't like your attention for christina. I try to keep her coming into the studio. And i want to prevent that she finds out the truth. It's impossible that she hears the truth as long as nobody tells it. Leave me alone now. Do you know that we have doubled the turnover for this month? Why did you tell her about the mirror? I didn't know... - stop that nonsense! I know what you're doing. I know your dirty tricks. Ok, i told her. But just to stop you from doing other stupid things. I can take care of myself, francesca. - Save your accusations. Do i have to remind you of yourjob? You're a boy whose job it is to satisfy the perversions of well known people. You always wanted to get rid of me. Now, you've done it. There's somebody at the door. - Don't stop, please. Hello, josephine. Come in, christina. How are you? - I'm fine. I need to talk to somebody. Therefore i've come to you... i'm sorry for disturbing you. Hello, flavia. - Nice to see you. - Don't worry you are not disturbing. - I just wanted to ask you for an advise. I feel desperate. I'm still in love with andrea but i love my husband, too. I need to decide myself. - Don't rush it. - no, you don't understand. I'm feeling guilty. You must open up yourself. Free your mind. Don't blame yourself. You didn't want that to happen. What gibberish. It's a wonderful horse. - Do you think that he'll win on sunday? I hope so. He's going strong. We could use a victory to get some publicity. I've got an idea: What do you say if andrea... ...would join us on our little trip we've planned? - Yes, what do you think? L'll think about it. - Professor capi, you've got a call. Thank you. I'm coming. Excuse me. Take me now. I want it. This is not a good moment. Let's do it here. Right now. Did you come here to watch the girls? No, this is the place where i first made love. I didn't expect you being romantic. Christina, i don't like this anymore. But you have set this whole thing up? I have no scruples. Money means a big deal to me. I would do anything for money, you know that. But this time i'm taking it to heart. Stop apologizing. I don't believe you. - You're making fun of me. I know it sounds strange. But you are the first woman to trust me. I know you did it only because you loved me. I've been hoping night and day that you would come to me. Christina, i love you. Make love to me right here. Christina... ...come with me. Do you think that it would help us? - Of course. I've got a lot of money. Enough for a new beginning. Let's go far away. - No, andrea. It's too late. I thought that love would join us, but when i heard about the mirror, i realized the truth. - Don't tell me, that you love him? - Yes, even more then before. I've learned to understand. The mirror has opened my eyes and... ...i think i like it. This may be love too. I can't live without you. That's not true. Drive me home, please. It's me. How are you, darling? - Diego, i didn't hear you coming in. Hope you're glad that it's me. What did you do? Something special? I wasn't at home. - What did you do? I took a walk because i had to talk to someone. To andrea? - Andrea? Why? Just an idea. Because you met very often each other. Maybe, but things aren't as it would appear. Would you like to eat something? No, thanks. Why did you want to talk to him? Andrea ist just a footboy. He always does what other people tell him. Maybe you are right. Should i talk to him? No, i will do it by my own. I think he is a corrupt man. - Really? I will take him to task. Oh, you are impressing me. If you will really do this... i would be very proud of you. Cheers, diego. What about the money? I've got it. But i don't like it to do. Don't break into tears. Please, try to understand. You have to accept it. I love her. That's the truth. She means a lot to you. Yes, that's right. Okay. Good luck to you. Farewell, francesca. Did you think about it? - Yes. Will you come with me? Andrea, there is no future for us. How can you talk like that? You can't be serious. The truth is that we don't belong together. But we could try it. I love you. I'm sorry to say that i don't love you. Perhaps you will change your mind. It's never too late for that. I will wait for you. By the way, i told you about this young man that i met in the travel agency. He's nice. His name is italo bufani. You'll like him. He's grown up on the sea and specialize in seafaring. He'd be the perfect partner for our trip. When do i meet him? - This evening at dinner. The sea is as fascinating as a woman. I need it. - Do you remember that strong seafarer we met on last vacations? Yes, but he prefered men. Have i told you that despite of his age, the seven seas are like home for italo? - Not all yet, but i'm working on it. Are you sure, you won't be bored? We are rookie sailors. - On the contrary! In fact, i believe we will have a lot of fun. So do i. Let's drink a toast to the future. Cheers.
