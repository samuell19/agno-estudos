Papa? Papa, you're bleeding. It's fine, the sea water will clean it up. Hey, it's Papa. Where is he? Let's join him. Hey, wait. I envy you. You have such a tight bond with your dad. They're all employees at his companies. So much money and free time. The charm of middle-aged, single men. He inherited from my granddad. Papa didn't actually earn it. What are you painting? I'd like to see your painting. I heard you're taking an art exam. Hey, you all jumped in. Papa. Hey, Yoko. Help me, they're assaulting your dad.

Yoko, how are you? I'm fine. We're camping on that beach over there. - Come and visit us. - Sure. Papa, I'll leave you for now. I'm joining my friends. Sure. Hey, careful, careful. Ah, what an idiot. Come, come. Welcome home. Can I look at your painting? Is it any good? I trust your artistic sense. Isn't that too raw for the Art School exam? It's a matter of sense. I like the ecstasy of that beautiful face. She doesn't feel pain. I didn't know you could paint the expression of pleasure. Of course I do, I'm a grown-up woman now. Of course, no shark has ever bit me yet. What's wrong? A guest is coming. We need to talk, Yoko. I'm going to remarry. Who is she? Not one of those girls from the boat, I hope. I'd like to clean up my life style. How so? It's all about pleasure. It's not proper. I need a person who can lift me up. You know her. She has a gallery in Ginza. You mean Miss Kida. She's not even in the same league as Mom was. Ms. Kida is really not the type you need. She's superficial and conceited. Come on, she's young and she knows about painting. You'd be good friends. You and me both... We need a mother figure in our life. I don't need a mother. I could help you straighten up if you like. And if you need a motherly type... I can fill that role for you. You can't replace your Mom. But I have to admit... even your body is exactly like hers. You're not your Mom, you'll never be. Am I lacking in any way? Just tell me. How can you say you'd replace her? Let me get the door. Good evening. Welcome. We were waiting for you. - Please. - Thank you. Good evening. Papa just told me. I was congratulating him. Oh. May I comment on that painting? Go ahead. I'm seeing pleasure on that woman's face... although she should be in agony. She seems pleased to be devoured. That shark is missing some teeth. Why are they broken? It must mean something. Yes, I had the same impression. Why is it missing teeth? It's just like that. Don't read too much into it. It's an old shark. It can't really handle that beauty. Poor shark. Ms. Yoko. There. You'll enjoy it. It's William Blake's drawings. I'm sure you'll study them. I'll see if I have time. I hope you'll honor my gallery too. I'm not painting for any exhibition. There. Thank you. Mom. Mom. She's in that difficult age. Are you going to get along? I'll try my very best. You are our only hope for redemption. Does Yoko have a lover? How were you at her age? I was so dedicated to the exhibitions. I had only paintings in mind. Here? It's fine. We'll get married. - Where's Keiko? - Over there. Sir, how do you imagine an ideal summer? The sea, the dazzling sun, lying lazily on the beach. A suntanned beauty in a swimming suit. We hope you'll go to the beach with all those pretty girls. Will you find a girlfriend? Well, I'm planning to take a holiday... and go to a resort next week... to enjoy summer. The beaches are buzzing this year. You haven't been to the beach yet? Go, quick, before the summer iS gone. Typhoons may come early this year on the southern beaches. We'll air a series on people's experiences. Enjoy summer while it's here... and tell us about your fun experiences. The audience will look forward to it. Now the requests. What? You just arrived? Yes. Yeah! Yay, yay, yay. Yoko, come on! Stay where you are! We're the police! Don't move! Stay here! Don't resist! Calm down! - That hurts! - Stand up! That hurts! Come here! What do you want? We're not doing anything wrong! She never did that before. You can go home now. Thank you. Did they have to arrest us? Ms. Yoko. Ms. Yoko. Why couldn't Papa come? Usually he comes for me. You should not worry him like that. You talk like a mom. Your dad wants me to help with your education. Don't expect too much. From now on, you'll chose your friends and acquaintances more carefully. It's for your own sake. Please, give me a ride. It's dangerous. What are you doing here at night with a surfboard? I argued with my friend. We came with his car. - Where are you headed? - Tokyo. OK, hop in. - Thank you. - Ms. Yoko. Ms. Yoko! You girls are sisters. No, she's my mom. Well, she wants to replace my mom. You won't get to Tokyo tonight. You should stay at my place. Ms. Yoko! There. Tonight this will be your inn. You want one of my dad's pajamas? I'll sleep naked. Ah, really? The shower is over there. It'll freshen you up. A towel. You can come to my room for a coffee later. Sure. Sorry, I have a little hard on. No way! You're a painter? Just an amateur. - There you are. - Thank you. Are you a student? Yes. What are you doing on holidays? Surfing. I'll compete in Hawaii next year. - A competition? - Right. That's amazing. The waves there are as big as this house. Really? - That must be scary. - Yes, itis. That's the thrill. That's incredible. Ms. Yoko, I'm coming in. Good morning. You slept late. - Where's he? - He left. It was so early, I didn't even see him. - I borrowed your apron. - It suits you. Where's Papa? Hey, there's fresh coffee. Papa, good morning. Hey, good morning. I don't approve of your behavior last night. Akiko was really puzzled and concerned. As for me, you can have a boyfriend... but with a modicum of courtesy. Thanks. What time is your entrance exam. Don't worry, I'll tidy up your room. Ms. Yoko, you can't go out without breakfast. Have you seen Keiko? They're making out in his car. Her boyfriend is back? It seems she lost her job. Well... Can I bother them? They'll be done soon. Wait here. Yoko, what's up? I was just talking with the gang. I heard you're short on cash. Well, my boyfriend is a spender. I help him. I see. I can find you a generous protector. Really? I need a favor in return. Welcome. How was your surfing? - Excellent. - Great. Papa, a drink. Thank you. You're so pretty. Thank you so much. Papa. There, a flower. - There. - Thanks. And now, dear audience, let me present... the 'Chinese Mantis from Shonan'. Pechapai Anli will perform for you. Ladies and Gentlemen, enjoy the show! It's so sad that tonight is our last party. Summer can't last forever. Is your new wife tightening the leash? Don't let her tame you like an old dog. Papa's secret for youth is to rub against young skin. Forgive my bluntness. Hey, is she your new stepmom? Papa, I'd like to introduce someone. Keiko is a fan of yours. Thank you for your support. And I thank you for your hospitality. She'd like to dance with you. I'd be honored. Please. - Mister... - Yes? You're amazing. Why did you ask me here? Papa, we need your help. I'd like to borrow money. How much do you need? More than 50,000 yen. Wow, I'm so grateful! Hey! Let me offer something in return. Don't do that! Please sir, don't be So serious about it! I always dreamed about being held by a powerful man. Sorry, I'm not that man. Papa. You have a playboy reputation to uphold. Keiko is a very skilled partner. Don't let a good favor go to waste. Madam, have you seen photos of my mom? People say I look just like her. Even my body. Papa said so. Yoko, did you call me here... to talk about your mother? My dad and my mom loved to party. They connected through that lifestyle. They really knew how to enjoy life. That's what I admire in them. Madam... Why do you think Papa wanted to marry you? Does he have an eye on your gallery? These are adult matters. I don't think you can understand. What a waste. You may still want to enjoy life... and here you sold your freedom to an old man. My freedom? What do you know about my freedom? Surely you could have enjoyed your youth. I'm not sure what you mean by "enjoy your youth"... Like, when you invited that young surfer that night? You always deliver the parental speech. I'm kind of wasting my time here. I'll go back now. A wave like a mountain. - I plowed right through. - You're amazing! When the wind fills the sail... What are you doing here? You met her at the party. Keiko, Yoko's friend. Hey, listen! Let's all go out with the boat sometime. - See you. - See you, sir. Until next time. Yoko. Your dad is a great man. - Did you enjoy it? - I did. What a spoiled brat! Give me a break! Expelled? You haven't paid your fee for months. I'm taking you off coast everyday. Because of your competition in Hawaii... it's all about you. Let's go. You don't even have a car. You're a parasite! Hey there! Hey, it's you. Can you teach me surfing? - Any experience? - None at all. It's hard. It's not balanced like a boat. It's fine! Let me try! Paddle now. Here's the wave. Too late! One more time. Too early! Firm on your legs. We'll take this wave. Paddle! Alright. - There. - Thank you. Check out these big waves. In Hawaii these are nothing. I'm serious. I should buy a board and train. It's too early, no? I think I'm getting good at this. You'll have to learn the basics first. Yeah, the basics. Nevermind those guys. You don't need them to practice surfing. You just need the sea. You're right in a way. Would you come to my place? You can leave your board at my place. - There. - Thanks. - What's wrong? - Excuse me. Yes, Mizusawa speaking. Ms. Yoko. I'm stuck in that rain. Could you come pick me up? Where are you now? You were barefoot on the beach The blue moon was reflected by the sea I took you in my arms Let's go now. Since you're already here, why not enjoy yourself a little? I felt my heart in my chest Tonight, tonight, tonight... I will hold you Tonight, tonight, tonight... I will hold you Don't you dance? Come on! Come on, dance! Dance! Come on! Alright! What are you doing? Let me go! I told you to stop! No, don't touch me! - Just calm down! - No! Don't... No! Come on, move your ass a little! No! Don't! There, Papa. What's wrong, Akiko? Akiko, are you pregnant? Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic Raising a Child Right. I see. Thank you. She didn't even call the gallery. Where can she be? Yoko, did you tell Akiko something? Your shirt over your shoulders, open the window The wind blows in your hair, cools your body... The smell of your skin, the hot shower... Let me wash your body A female victim of a bewitching summer Be careful, men can be mean Be careful, be careful, daydream, daydream... Be careful, be careful, dreaming on the pillow
