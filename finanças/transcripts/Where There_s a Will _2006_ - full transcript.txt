LIKE ME? - MOST LIKELY, YEAH. - SO, IN OTHER WORDS, I WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR HER USING HER ASSETS? - YEAH. PAY THE HOSPITAL BILLS, THE RENT AT THE REST HOME, THAT SORT OF THING. YOU'D PROBABLY EVEN BE ABLE TO SELL HER PROPERTY IF YOU NEEDED TO. - HMM. I COULD NEVER BRING MYSELF TO DO THAT. IT'S THE ONLY HOME SHE KNOWS. - WELL, I'M SURE IT WON'T COME TO THAT. - NOW, IT'S NOT EASY TO PROVE SOMEBODY MENTALLY INCOMPETENT. SHE'LL HAVE TO BE TESTED. - HOW DO WE START? - FIRST OF ALL, FOR THE COURT TO GRANT YOU A FULL GUARDIANSHIP, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE THE CLEAR AND UNCONTESTED HEIRTO HER ESTATE. - WHAT ABOUT THE REST HOME? IS THAT GOING TO COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG? - A BAD ONE IS 60 GRAND A YEAR. - WHOA. WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT? CAN'T I GET THEM TO PAY FOR THAT? - ONLY IF A PERSON IS POOR, AND I MEAN DIRT POOR. - THEN SHE'S POOR. DIRT POOR. PUT THAT DOWN. - SHE'S DIRT POOR? - DIRT. DIRT. - ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

THIS, DEAR HEARTS, IS MY FAVORITE, AND, OH MY, DOES IT SPEAK TO OUR DUTY AND HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES AND THE REWARD WE CAN EXPECT WHEN WE PASS ON. - [sighs] - BEING MERCIFUL MEANS DOING WHATEVER WE CAN FOR SOMEBODY ELSE... IN FACT, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT A HABIT OF BEING MERCIFUL. LOOK HERE! IT'S MORE THAN AN OBLIGATION. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WHO'S IN NEED. - NOW, HOW SOON WILL YOU BE NEEDING OUR SERVICES, MR. GREENE? - UH, I'M NOT REALLY SURE. SHE'S ILL. ANY DAY NOW. - OH, I SEE. THIS IS A PRE-NEED ARRANGEMENT. WELL, THAT'S VERY, VERY WISE ON YOUR PART. NOBODY WANTS TO BE DOING BUSINESS WHEN THEY'RE BROKEN-HEARTED AND PROSTRATE WITH GRIEF.

NOW, YOU SURE I CAN'T INTEREST YOU IN THE REDWOOD, THE CEDAR OR THE KNOTTY PINE? - NO, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THE BASKET CASKET. - NOW FOR THE SERVICE, WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU BE REQUIRING A LIMOUSINE? - NO LIMOUSINE. NOTHING FANCY. WHEN SHE DIES, JUST STICK HER IN THE BASKET, PUT IT IN THE GROUND, THAT'S IT, OK? - RICHIE? - OH! WELL, HELLO, ANNIE. - I REALLY ADMIRE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. - ME? - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE IT, BUT YOU WERE HER LAST HOPE. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT HER IN A REST HOME.
