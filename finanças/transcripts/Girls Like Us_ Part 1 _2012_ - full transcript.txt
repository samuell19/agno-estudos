Yes, bye Greg it was nice to meet you again. Mwha! See more of you? Yea aright. Quit it now. So, where's Zoi? Why isn't she here? She had to make a couple errands for our get together tomorrow night. Get together. Um huh. I want to come to dat. No way. You are not invited. It's for lesbians, not straight girls like you. Whatever AJ. It's just a party. Are you serious? No, it's the party. So, I see you and uh Greg been gettin a little close huh? Yea we are. That's a real touchy situation. I like Greg. He's nice and everything but he's movin way, way too fast for me. How? This morning when I woke up he had a note on the nightstand asking me to move in wid him. Ah, that is so sweet. I mean that's awesome. Just think after that what, next step is marriage then kids. Man mom and daddy be so happy. They would I mean finally they have a daughter that marries a man, they'll love dat. He's just moving way too fast for me. Um uh. I mean have you told him yet? No, I haven't told Greg or anybody else anything. Greg is in surgery all day and it's buying me time. Enough about that, what'd you call me here for? Well, since you said it like that um, I'm gonna be honest wit you. I want you to lay up on Zoi. I think you a little bit too rough on her. Yes, I do. I do. I am not that hard on Zoi. Yea, you are. I mean seriously what y'all been rooming together for the last what couple of months now and it's like you still walking around with this cold shoulder to her and I just want you to stop. I mean she's like your sister. Key word is like. And Zoi know why it's like it is. Well look, whether she does or not I don't like it. I'm not that bad to her. Are you serious? Keisha did you forget about the time she paid you in advance to get her a Prince ticket and you didn't get it and she wasn't able to go. You know that was wrong. Well she [inaudible] Not to mention did you forget about that time you also said okay y'all let's go out to eat. I'm gonna pay for everybody but when we get there you pay for everybody cept her. She didn't starve to death. Keisha, my point is I don't think its right. Would you just promise me you'll stop? I never looked at it like that before. I guess I could try to be a little nicer to her. I mean did you forget she is the one that you know helped you through law school. Well, I'm sorry not helped, but convinced you to go. Why would you say dat? No she didn't. Remember the time you was gonna drop out. She was the one that was there to convince you to say in. No she didn't. Why would you say dat? Come on, how could you forget? Okay member you wanted to drop out when and not even go for a love interest, for a unsure thing. You was gonna jeopardize your whole life for that. And she convinced you not to and I think that's the best move you know that you did. Now, look how happy-- look how you turned out actually. I promise you, you don't know what you talking about. Zoi was not there any days to go to school with me. She didn't help me take the bar. She didn't convince me to do anything. She didn't have to. She was the one that convinced you to stay in school and that's what mattered the most. Um, whoopdi do, lucky me, big time attorney with a broken heart. What do you mean? Never mind I don't want to talk about it. So you gonna ease up on her? I'll try to be nicer to her I guess. Thank you. [ Traffic sounds ] [ Inaudible background discussion ] So, wassup? Well, I brought you here to tell you I love her Diane. You love who? I love Keisha. You kiddin right? No, I'm for real. Zoi how you gonna love somebody that treats you like a dog. I don't know.

Where was your pack at last night when my pussy was right in your face? What? You heard me. You know how I felt about the situation. Don't do dat. I don't believe this shit. Besides it takes many women to satisfy my appetite. What the fuck are you tryin to say? What I'm saying is its over. We're through. You know what, fuck you Zoi. Fuck you. I never want to see you again. Get your shit and get the fuck out of my dorm. Alright. Ah, what the fuck? So, hold up, you mean to tell me you fucked my best friend eight years ago and I had no idea. That's exactly what I'm tellin you. I think you lyin. See, Keisha would tell me something like that. No I'm not lyin. We made love all night long. The girl don't tell you everything. Damn that's amazing. I know right. So, like what happened? Like-- Well I heard Keisha was gonna drop out of school to pursue a relationship with someone, automatically I assumed it was with me. So, I decided I had to break it off wid her. You had to break it off. So, besides the point that you're super vain, like what went wrong though? Like what really happened? I just told you what happened. Well, I don't understand. Look, what I'm saying is I don't want Keisha throwin her career away because of me. Okay, so let me get this straight. What you're telling me is you fucked my friend one day, broke her heart the next day for no good reason, really? You know what maybe you right. Damn skippy I'm right. No wonder she treats you like shit. I would too. Look, I know I made a mistake and now I want to make things right. I want her back. Good luck with that. What you mean good luck with that? Come on, aren't you gonna help me get her back? Hell no. See you know what you fucked my friend once without me even knowing, now you want me to help you fuck her again? No, not gonna happen. Look, I know I messed things up. And now I want to make it up to her. I love her Diane. So, please, please help me get Keisha back. Look, it's not gonna be that easy Zoi. See, Keisha told me this mornin that Greg akxed her to move in with him. What? Yea, look I'm sorry okay. Um, I'm not gonna be able to help you with this one. You're on your own this time, but I love you, but I got to go. Okay, I got to get back to work. I will see you at the house baby. Be cool. Aright. Check please. [ Walking around room ] Hey Zoi. Oh, wassup Keisha? Is AJ and Diane here yet? No, they still at their company party. Um, how was your day? What, you asking me about my day? Stop playin so much. Yes, Zoi Baker. Well it was cool for what it was worth, I suppose. How was your day? Oh so long. I'm so glad to be home. So, you goin to your friend house tonight? What's his name again, I know it rhymes with dred. Stop playin punk. You know his name is Greg. Oh yea him, dang. I was so looking forward to having that bed to myself again tonight. Well, you can get over dat. Because I'm gonna be right here. Besides, I was here first anyway. Hasn't it been about eight weeks? Why are you still here? I just talked to the contractor; he said it should be another two weeks. By then I should be out your hair. And it cannot come fast enough for me. Whatever Keisha. You hungry? Um peanut butter and jelly, um uh. I haven't done dat in about 10 years. Go for it. Cool I wadn't makin you one anyway. Anyway can I ask you something? Sure, shoot. I was wondering out of all of the hundreds of women that you've dated, if there was one that you could back would you? Well, first off let me correct you. I haven't dated over 100 women; I've only dated four but I've sexed, many. You know exactly what I mean. Answer the question. Well, I mean there is one woman I regret letting go. Can I axk you how it happened? Well let's just say without gettin into further details about what occurred I had to break up with her so that she would continue her education. So you mean you put somebody else's education over the way you felt about em? Yea, I guess I did. I guess that was a nice thing. I know, but it hurts you know, cause we're not together. So, why don't you get her back? I can't. You can't or you won't? I can't, because she's datin somebody else. So, why don't you go to her and tell her how you feel? I'm sure she'll leave that person to be wit you. No, I don't think she would. I think you should try. I guess you right. [ Music ] Keisha? Hmm? Look I'm sorry I broke your heart. I never meant to hurt you. I was truly thinking about your future and I didn't want you throwin it away because of me. Baby, I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I appreciate you sayin that, but I know your heart. No problem. Now can I axk you a question? Um huh. Baby you can ask me anything. Are you really moving in with Greg? What? Did Diane tell you that? Yea, she did. I went to talk to her earlier to tell her what really happened between us eight years ago, because I wanted her to help me get you back. That's when she told me he asked you to move in with him. I don't know what I'm gonna do about Greg. I just started seein him. You know I like him. He's a nice guy, but that's not where my heart is. I know, because you don't love him. You love me. Of course I love you and only you, but it's not about you and I. It's about my parents. My family is trippin. You know my father really wants a grandson and AJ has already hurt their heart. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Why can't we just enjoy what we have right now? Okay. [ Kissing ] [ Silence ] Something smells good. [inaudible] I made enough for you, you hungry? You so sweet. Yea, I'll take a plate. Um, if I wadn't thinking straight the way you two just looked at each other it like y'all fucked last night. Come on AJ what you talkin bout man? AJ. Lord. Don't you think you reading a little bit too much into that? Diane stay the fuck out of dis. This is my sister. I got this. Okay, I know that's your sister now but you gonna watch your mutha fuckin tone with me. Anyway, what was that about? Why you always trippin? Didn't you axk me to be nice to her. I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. You know I don't understand all that. AJ why you trippin man? Why am I trippin? You want to know why I'm trippin? Because I don't want my sister messing with my best friend, that's why I'm trippin. She can't make me lunch? I mean this is the same person the first move in y'all was at each other throats. Now here it is you want to make sandwiches and shit for her and all this googley eye shit. What is that about? Did she try anything wit you last night? No. Why would you axk that? You tryin to fuck my sister? Oh my God. Come on man, nobody's tryin to fuck your sister. You know I got bitches. Yea, hopefully she ain't tryin to be one of em either. You know what sis? What? I got a question for you. What? Why you such a big ass hater? Little girl if you don't keep your hands out of my mutha fuckin face it's gonna be one. Just as I thought, you don't have a fuckin answer. [ Music ] [ Walking up stairs ] We here. Keisha what are you doin here? What you mean? I was invited by one of your members. You know, the lesbians. Man who broke my rule and invited by straight sister to a all lesbian event? What you mean? I invited her. Man, I told all members my sister was off limits. You didn't tell me dat. Zoi, I didn't think I had to. You're the co-founder. You and I make the rules. Oh, AJ stop trippin. Yea, AJ. Wassup?

Okay, well who's supposed to ask her the question? Let her sister ask her. Okay. Okay come on baby. Truth or dare? Truth. Okay, if you found out that one of your members was bangin me what would you do? What you mean banging? Fucking, licking, fucking, hitting my walls doogie style? Ooh, girl. Keisha stop playin wit me. I'm not playin wit you. You see a smile on my face? It depends if it was one of my members I would deal with it accordingly. However, if it's Zoi then our friendship would be over. [ Music ] [ Opening door ] I been asking everybody about you. You okay? Hell no, I'm not okay. What's wrong wit you? What you mean what's wrong with me? For real, what were you thinking axking AJ some bullshit like that? What was wrong with what I axked AJ? Are you smoking something? Everything was wrong with that question. Stop trippin Zoi. I'm just having fun, damn. Look, if you want to have fun go to Six Flags Great America. But if you want to use me in this game to prove a point to AJ do me a favor and don't, aright? Forget you, you know dat. Yea good luck with dat. Good luck with forgettin me. It won't be hard baby. So you say. So I know. You see baby, when my eyes are all entwined in Greg's I don't think bout you. Not the least bit. What'd you just say? You heard me loud and clear. No, I heard you but I don't think I understood that shit. Last night was nothin but a fuck to me. That's cool. I should have never started fuckin wit you. I'm not holdin you hostage. Nobody said you was. Then move around. Suddenly, I'm gettin the urge to. Well how bout I help you with that urge. I'm outta here. Where you goin? You gonna run out to your little goofy ass backup again? You know exactly where I'm goin and Greg is not the backup, you are, huh. Shit, whatever. Can you believe it girl we got Kevin Brown in jail 30 years baby baby, we need a drink. Yes, oh cheers. Oh Lord, it took forever. I know right. But you know we da bomb. We are the bomb. That's why they pay us the big bucks. Who you tellin? Um huh. Um huh. Um, oh my goodness, hello. Hey love. Hey, how are you? Well, I could be better. Is it Keisha again? I really don't want to discuss it over the phone. Can I come over? You sure can. Alright cool, I'm on my way. Bye. Oh gosh. What's wrong sis? Nothin, I'm good. Hmm, you don't seem good. Who was that on the phone? Zoi. Zoi? You still fucking around with that bitch? Yes, but not literally, calm down. Gosh. Wow. Look, I know things didn't work out well between us but we still friends. I can't believe that you still fucking around with a bitch that left your ass for the woman she's calling you about right now. Are you fucking serious? Yes, and-- That's stupid. Well, I don't remember asking your opinion on my love life now did I? No you didn't, but. But nothing, stay out of my love life okay? You know what on that note I fucking will. Okay. Hmm, cool. Cool. I'm outta here. Bye big sis. Bye little sis. But anyway, give me some love. [ Kissing ] [ Sighing ] [ Walking away ] [ Opening door ] Hey, wassup? [ Walking away ] [ Closing door ] [ Silence ] Hey. Wassup, Boo? How are you? How ya doin? Good. What's wrong wit you? You already know. It's Keisha. What'd she do now? You know she hasn't been home since the night of da party. Are you kidding me? That was a week ago. She's with Greg. Are you sharing Keisha with Greg? Yes, I am. That is interesting. I guess you could say I gave her my consent. Nonetheless, I don't like the way she's treatin you. She's not treatin me any kind of way. Well, I don't like the way you're letting her treat you. Look, I'm playin the game the way it is played. What game is that? You and I both have dated straight women before and we know typically there is always a man close by. Yea, normally it's the husbands, baby daddies, ex-boyfriends or current boy toys. And we also know that we have to share quality time with that man. Oh, I don't like to share my woman with another woman let alone a man. That's why I don't straight girls, Curious Georges, bisexual women. You gotta date somebody. You right, cause I hate fuckin myself. And the chance of gettin a 100 percent lesbian is slim to none. Maybe true, but I screen my girls. How do you screen em? I give them a questionnaire. What does dat do? It determines whether my girls are licky or strictly dickly. Bitch you crazy. No, I'm being for real. So you say. So you know. Whatever. You better stop sayin whatever and think about sexually transmitted diseases. What? The question isn't what, but do you think about sexually transmitted diseases? Yea, all the time. Ha, ha I find that hard to believe. Why is that hard to believe? It's hard for me to believe that you still sexin Keisha and you know she fucking Greg. It's not that easy to resist her. Oh, trust it's easy. How you figure that? Oh think about HIV, herpes, gonorrhea and syphilis, but most of all think about your life. Axk yourself how long you want to live. I think you right. No, I know I'm right. I got some thinking to do. Stop playing Russian roulette with your life Zoi. I will Lea. Look, I'm not saying Keisha's a bad girl. I'm just saying if she wants to be wit you, she has to make a choice between you and Greg. She can't have both. My thoughts exactly. And if she doesn't choose you, I'll take you myself. Lea, you and I tried that years ago and it didn't work out. It didn't work out cause you cheated on me while you were in Boston with Keisha. You knew about that? Oh, please. I knew. So why didn't you say anything to me about it? There was nothing to talk about and I went back to my ex-girlfriend. So I guess we're even. I wouldn't say that. What would you say? I say you and I have unfinished business and one day we'll finish it. You think? So, I know, however, here's a set of keys to my crib. You can come and go as you please. You sleepin in my bed tonight, make yourself at home. Where you goin? I got a booty call. Now what's all that crap you just talked about STDs? Look my girl passed her questionnaire with flying colors. But can you say the same? That's a low blow. Wow. Well, if the shoe fits wear it baby. Lea, I love you. I love you too but take care of yourself and lock up after you leave. Will do. Alright. Live for the moment. Ain't no time like the present. You say you ain't into rushin I say time is of the essence. Love is not the issue but it may [inaudible] and you always saying you do but I don't know if it's real. I'm kinda thinkin that you want it for lust, but that's my fear, but fear comes with the pain so I'm letting go of fear. But you just be front and while you front and I can see your eyes with wit contacts I can see what's inside, ain't no surprise that I caught more feeling than I suspected. I mean one minute you say you love me, next minute I feel neglected but it's cool. Who I am? I'm glad you inquired. I am inspiration inspired. The reason the whack can now retire. I am the softest place on earth. I am creativities' rebirth. I am that wait that you know it is worth. Who am I? I'm glad you asked. I am God's present gift culminating from my past. I am light divinely guided from above. I am peace. I am love. Sending tingles up my spine again our angles intertwined. Our extremities were entangled in conjured ecstasy. My body was begging for a reckoning. A beating ravenous for him to feed this hunger, I can't wait any longer. But he was disciplined and stronger, tantricly seducing me, his pleasure package ruling me, along with that coconut kiss. And had my legs atwist beneath his grip, my hips eager to enlist in the bedroom board that was before me. Long-- IDs. Thank you. Wait, no no. Hold up, hold up. What up? I need to see your ID. Hey, hey they with me. That don't mean shit to me they came wit you. I need to see their IDs. Hey be smooth baby. Hey IDs guy. Okay. Hi bro. Who the fuck is that? Oh, you talkin about the Jackson five? Yea. No for real though. You see that goofy lookin one in the front right there? Yea, what about him? That's Keisha boyfriend. Her boyfriend. Yea, her goofy ass boyfriend. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought you was her boyfriend. No, see that's where you got it wrong. I'm her girlfriend. You know what I'm sayin? Wait a minute, so you tryin to tell me all this time you and Keisha been in a relationship and you been sharin her with a man, especially a goofy lookin mutha fucker? Hell yea. Man, you just lost all cool points. What you mean? What you mean what I mean? Look man, I don't know about you Zo, but all I know is real lesbians just don't do shit like that. I mean I don't even want to share my girl with another girl let alone a stanky ass man. You know what, you right, you right. Sad to say, I am. Alright but you know what though, after tonight I'm gonna straighten everything out. You sure about that? Yea, I got this. Alright, girl. Um huh. Introduce an apology, no mercy. [Applause] Hello everybody. This piece that I'm gonna do is yes, it is true. Yes it is true behind the shy look in my eyes I will fuck you. Fuck my fingers through the down tone, each of them reach to go deep, further than my tongue after it has tasted a taste of you. As you suck that taste from my lips my fingers in a tunnel oh yea, goin against your sweet wet walls. My fingers, now a fist, feelin the power of my love in that dark warm place, where you hold me, so tightly. The love flows from my fingertips touchin a space we see with our eyes closed. The sweat drips from underneath my breasts as we glide holding on tight. The ripples comin into this place shake the space. Our eyes are open now to each other's smile. My lips breathe warm breath, huh, on your ears. Yes, it is true. Behind the shy look in my eyes, I want to fuck you, want to be held in that dark space so tightly my fingers cuddled with my lovin. You whisper to me baby don't stop. I penetrate that part of you you hadn't thought was open, learning to fly. Hadn't thought, stopped thinking yes. It is true I want to fuck you.
