Oh! Sorry. Okay. - After you, Sandy. - Oh, my God. You get it? Yes. Is there anything you wanted? You guys... Welcome. You look so good! - Yeah, I love the costume. - And you got the news? - Yeah, we all did. - Hey, how's it going? Uh, a little treat, I think. Yeah, I'll grab a black coffee? And we'll grab Sandy's coffee. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah, you're welcome. - The usual, "Sandy"? - Yes. - I'm Zoey. - I'm Enzo. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Paolo. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, where are you guys from? Well, I'm from Australia, but I flew in from Milan. Oh, good. So you missed the whole... Yeah, just made it. So lucky. If anything closed... I think we were, like, one of the last flights. - Super lucky. We're really like... - Yeah. In Red Hook, it's crazy right now. The trees are down. I mean, I thought Hurricane Sandy was gonna be like Irene. Why does everybody underestimate the female hurricanes? I think this one's gonna be bad. So you guys friends, or... - We're actually brothers. - Yeah. From different mothers. Literally. That's not a joke. - Yeah, well, long story. - Long story. A story for another time. Well, if you guys are around later, my roommates and I, um, we live upstairs, but, um, we're having people over. What's the theme? Did you figure it out? There's a lot of tension between it's either vintage Halloween - or fall for Sandy. - "Fall for Sandy"? It's like, we fell for Hurricane Irene, - Fall for Sandy... - Oh! But also, autumn. I like that, I like a good autumn. I don't like a good autumn. - Double entendre. - Yes. We have dinner plans tonight, but maybe we'll come back later. - Yeah, I mean... - We don't know if those are good, anyway. - That's true, yeah. - Yeah. It's just the second floor facing the window. - Okay. - 2B. Okay, well, or not to be. Well, I hope it's to be. Yeah, so do I. Ignore that. That was silly. That was really silly. Thanks for the cup. Yeah. Thanks for the coffee. It was great. Great, thanks. - See you. - Bye. Well... Inviting strangers. - Just felt right. - Just felt right. Hey, Mom. ZOEY'S MOM: [ON PHONE] Hey, honey, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm just... I'm tired. ZOEY'S MOM: Did you hear about the apartment? Yeah, we just got the notice. I want you to come home and live with me. I love you, but I'm not gonna move home. Why not? So, do you have a plan - of where you're gonna go? - Yeah. Uh-huh. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Are you okay? No, I'm just... I'm... I'm... - All right. - Just tired. I just want you to be okay, all right? So, are you guys prepared for the storm? Yeah, we're prepared. Do you have everything you need? Definitely. Yeah. We're very prepared. God bless you. You take good care of yourself. Uh-huh. Bye, say hi to the girls. Isn't that cute? - They're so nice. - I know, I love them. Hold on, hold on a sec. ZOEY'S MOM: It's getting so quiet. "Dear Zoey, Liza and Jen, please be informed "that an inspector will be entering your apartment "within the next 48 hours "to prepare your move out "scheduled to take place by the end of November." - I'm sorry. - I know. Zoey. Zoey? Yeah. Thank you. Last one to shower fills the tub. Okay. Hi, did you eat? Yeah. Jen is going crazy. Yeah, I know. Oh. Do you want to trade me the petty glitter? Sure. Got some new colors. Ah, what does it... I can't... "Storm ready"? Yeah. I feel like the big nail polish industry is just capitalizing on this storm, just trying to sell more nail polish. Oh, my God. Don't let Jen hear you. She'll be so upset that all of her hurricane aid was for naught. Tease me all you want, but you'll thank me later. Remember to... Fill the tub! We know. Oh, my God. So can I just leave it like this, or do I need to drain it? You're disgusting. - Liza! Door. Thanks. - Sorry. Sorry, I know it's your time to read, but I need to tell you something. We had a dog and didn't go on to Hannah's. It was stupid. That's what you get. Why are you telling me that? Just wanted to... Zip it. The time my brother wanted to do math! No, no, no. What? Are we gonna do this? Storm ready? It's too much. I know. It's so much. I love it. No, there's too many themes. No, it's just cute. - This looks amazing. - You look amazing. You look so good! Oh, my God. - So pretty. - Oh, pretty. That's where that was, I was looking for that. - Didn't I ask for it? - No. - Ow! - Give her 200 bucks! You are out of control. Did you fill up the tub? Yes, I'll just go triple check. I filled the tub. - Called it. - Thank you. You're welcome. - You smell so good. - Thanks. Julian's gonna love this. No, he's not coming. - Why not? - I didn't invite him. You spent the night at his house, you didn't invite him? He didn't understand my Sandy costume. He thought I was a deranged clown. Did anyone understand your costume? Yes, actually. I met a man who did understand and I invited him. What? And his brother. Two strange mystery men? Two strange, tall mystery men. Okay, you're freaking her out. You need to relax. This is for you. - Fall for Sandy! - Thank you. A vintage Halloween soiree. You all... Oh, my God. - Hello. - How are you doing? You walked here? You're drenched. Yes, a crane dropped on the way. Aw! Hi. Oh! Some pastry. Hey, mama, how are you? Good, thank you. We walked in... This is embarrassing. You have to put your finger in that thing. You gotta put your hand in here. This is Bianca. First day jitters! - This is her first day? - Well, it's a hangout. It's a hangout. - It's a chill sesh. - It's a chill sesh. It looks like a crane collapsed on 57th street. Okay, this is saying winds are 95 miles an hour. Ninety-five? A crane, like a construction crane. Don't worry, I put together a bunch of stuff just in case anything happens. I'm aware that it's better to be prepared. A kit for us, okay? Oh. So, we've got a first aid kit. Trash bags, candles. And a bunch of water. We also filled up the tub to make sure that we have extra reserves. And also an AM/FM radio, okay? So... There's a lot of really good alternative music stations on there. Jen, I think that's really thoughtful. This is great. All right, you don't know what's gonna happen, you guys. All the talk about it has been that it's gonna be pretty serious. So I just thought that I would prepare the party. Well, you did a good job. You did a good job. - Thanks, Mom. - Thank you. And if anything happens, you guys know where the fire exit is, right? Okay, so it's out the hallway, and then we go out that big back hall. And there's a... You didn't know where it was? - Well, now I do. - Exactly! So it's out the hallway, and out that big back hall. You guys. I think we should have a drink, just, like, chill out. We're gonna be fine. Yeah, let's have a drink or something. Oh, man. My cousin, Julia, and her husband aren't coming. Aw! They can't get a cab from the upper west side. Guess they'll have to take a rain check, badam pum tss. Pretty good. - What is that? - Yeah, it's like a... A flood alert or something? Yeah, it's on here. Wait, everyone's getting it? I'm not getting it. Yeah, flood alert. That's so crazy. - Did you get it? - Yeah, I got it. It's saying... Yeah. Bloomberg just posted, "This is the storm of the century." You guys, turn on the TV. The high winds from Hurricane Sandy are suspected of causing the facade of an apartment building to collapse in Lower Manhattan, today. Apparently, apartment buildings around... - Wait... - I'm gonna... I'm gonna check outside. - Maybe the breaker or something? - Liam, be careful. - I didn't tape the window. - It was gonna open anyway. - Guys, there's no power on the whole block. - Oh, my God. - Are you kidding? - There's no power. Okay, let's go to the roof, we can see how far it goes. Seriously? - Roof! - Okay, okay. This is a bad idea. Zoey, this is too dangerous, you guys. Man, I kinda wanna see. I got it. I got it. Here, put these trash bags on. - Put it on. - Watch your step, you guys. Zoey, don't run so fast. Zoey! Zoey! You guys hear that? There's someone out there. You guys, I think the brothers are here. I'm gonna go let them in, okay? - What? What are you saying? - The brothers. From Tim and Joe's. I'm gonna go get them. - No, do not. - You're not going anywhere. I'll go get them. Yeah, I'll go with you. You want? Yes, please. - Hey. How are you doing? - Hey. This is Enzo, I'm Paolo. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Paolo. Nice to meet you, Enzo. Hey. We'll keep warm. - Hi. Paolo. - Hi. Hi, I'm Bianca. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah. I'm sorry, I went with Jen. That's okay. - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. Let's. Okay. - You guys want some wine? - Oh, thanks. Cheers. So you guys were saying there's a long story. - The two mothers. - Oh, Yes. Yes. - Well, we have all this time, so... - We have time. Yeah, well, we have the same dad. Paolo, who's my older brother... Um, Dad met my mum when he was travelling to Australia. She's from Indonesia originally. And they fell in love. And he was still married to Paolo's mum. So, that kind of happened. And then, probably about a year later, I was born. In Italy. So you guys have been in relationship with each other? Yeah, we grew up together. Summers. Well, we're kinda catching up. Gonna hang out for a week and then I'm gonna hit the road and go on a road trip by myself. To see the sights? I'm drinking here, so... Does anyone have a phone that's getting through? I just wanna text my girlfriend to tell her that... No, my... Mine's dead. Oh, you know what, I'm so fucking stupid. I can't text her anyway because I don't know her number. Does that make me bad for not knowing her number? I only know one number, it's my buddy, Chad's mom's number. Because I call her. We grew up together and I would call Chad but I call her every year on Mother's Day. - It's a landline. - Yeah it's a landline. - That's so cute. - 5-3-9-0-3-9-1. - That's so cute. - Aw. Whose phone is not dead at this point? - Mine's working. - Yours is working? Mmm-hmm, I don't have any internet, but it's working. Do you have any service? - Yeah, kinda. - I have a little bit left. I'm just, like, hogging it and holding it for the last... I don't know how long. Me, too, and I keep pressing it. Just, like, maybe. It's like a kneejerk... You know what, you guys... - It's my favorite phone. - I know, just in case it comes back on. - Let me try it one more time, see if I can get it. - I can call my mom. We are gathered here today to bid adieu to our sweet, sweet telephones. - Oh, no. - No! Boo! Dearest phone, you are a constant source of comfort and distraction. Both good and bad. You allow me to connect to the people I love most in this world. And you allow me to completely disengage from the people who I love most in this world. Good night, sweet prince. That was good. Words can be a lot... Hoping we would be able to get in touch with them, 'cause I haven't heard from her. Okay, don't make me feel bad about this. It's kind of like a thing that I'm doing. - All right, um... - Switch them off. Em, I hope you're safe. If you're on your way, I hope you scream loud so we can come get you. How dare you? How dare you? You're making it very real. You're making this too real. I love you so much. It will be okay. Oh, my God. - Are you crying? - I just can't... In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Phone. Yeah! - Amen! - Bye. - Amen! - Wow. - Rest in peace. - Good riddance. I feel very free. - I feel good. - I do, too. - Funny. - I'm kind of upset that you guys are gonna lose this place soon. Yeah, that's one word for it. It sucks. Can we have that when you leave? Oh, you wanna inherit that? - This thing? No! - Yeah. For the coffee shop. Yeah, you can have it. What do you mean, "You can..." You can't give that away, that's mine. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is! We split it, remember? Well, you were with me when I bought it. - And I paid you. Yes. - Did she pay? So you just cut it down in the middle. I mean, it is, honestly, best that it goes with them because we don't have places to put it in 30 days. - None of us. - That's true. Nobody has a home for this thing. So you can have it. Thank you. I'm sensing a little bit of, um, I don't know, some tension... - Yeah, that's very perceptive. - between you. Just bear with me. One sec. Okay? Everyone's full of ideas tonight. Yeah, everybody has a lot of... Do you smell cookies? Wait, hold up. Are y'all making cookies or some shit? Are y'all making butter walnut cookies or what? Uh, I wish. - Don't you smell that, though? - Yeah, it's nice. It must be next door. Thank you for waiting, my name is Doctor Liam. Oh, he's a therapist. - Oh! Therapist. - I'm here, today, to explore the emotional journey you three are about to embark upon. Now, I've found it to be helpful with previous clients to partake in some roleplay in order to empathize and really understand the experience of your fellow roommates. You, my dear, will be playing Liza. - Okay. - What a lucky girl. Jen will be taking the role of Zoey. Oh. And Jen. Oh, great. Great. This is a safe space, remember that. Let's talk about how you're feeling about the impending move. Okay. Well, I'm feeling very analytical and very objective about it. It's not ideal, the one thing I can say is it's not ideal. Not ideal. But, you know, I've got a lot of bigger fish to fry, I've got a lot on my plate, I'm doing my residency. And I'm thinking about a lot of just, like, big time doctor things. I'm feeling the exact opposite of that, actually, I'm feeling all sorts of emotions, I'm seeing colors, I'm painting it out, I'm doing a lot of free associating. - Very visual experience. - Visual dreamwork. And I'm doing a lot of late night snacking of frozen pizzas at midnight. Well, what I'm doing is, I'm actually not thinking about it at all. I'm just really present and living in the moment. And kind of just, like, going with the flow, whoever's around me and whatever I'm doing, right then and there. This seem like an appropriate impression of each other? Listen, you guys, I think you're being too childish about this right now, okay? It's a serious thing. - It's a serious thing. - I'm not being too childish about it. I'm just eating fruit roll-ups all the time and watching re-runs of Full House and it's really comforting to me and going to my acting class and then doing my acting exercises in the room, super loud, even though other people have stuff to do. You know what I think would help? Is if we just like, have a big party, and invite a bunch of random dudes over, um, that we just met this morning, and like, shake things up, you know what I mean? Like, who cares if there's a hurricane on the way. Let's just go with our hearts and, like, have a good time. Well, I care very, very much. I care very much that there's a hurricane on the way, and that's why I have prepared so meticulously for it. And I've done nothing for it. I forgot to fill the tub. And I interrupted Zoey when she was having a bath and having one moment to herself. And then left the door open, which I always do because I just forget. And I'm in my own world and don't really think about other people. You know what? I think we can all take a breath and remind ourselves that this is a safe space... No, I think we're gonna keep on going. It's so funny that you don't think about other people. - Oh, that's funny? That's funny to you? - Yeah, that's funny. - Yeah. - Why is that funny to you? I don't know, maybe because, um, it's what you do? Let's drop this, that's what you do, Zoe, that's what you do. You don't think about other people. What are you talking about? We're moving out because of you. I needed to do what was best for me, and what was best for me was to move out. And then it was up to you guys to find another roommate. I didn't know that we weren't gonna be able to keep the place because my name wasn't on the lease. That's not my fault. You don't even know where you're going. That's what's crazy about it. Okay, so, what, I'm gonna stay here forever? You could have chosen a better time. That's what I mean, it's not fair. I know that we're not 22 anymore. - Do you? - Yes, I do. It's like, what do you want me to do? I can't even afford to live somewhere else. That's not my fault. You are the one causing all of this! You are the hurricane! Sorry, you guys. - Everyone okay? - Yeah. Okay, yeah. That was such a stupid idea, I'm so sorry. - That's okay. - So, would this be a bad time to offer a business opportunity? Yes, this would be the worst time. I think I need a drink. Thank you. Yeah, I'll have some wine. People might be dying tonight. If we die tonight, what would you wish you'd gotten off your chest. That's what's going through my mind right now. It's so funny that you would say that. Um... Okay. So, I got a message. I don't even really know when I got it 'cause it was just sitting there in my inbox. Okay, so... backstory. My sophomore year of high school, I had Miss Keane for math. She was really cute, like she was super smiley and happy and I wanted to impress her. So, I studied really hard and I got pretty good at math. And then I found out that she was the assistant coach for the basketball team, so then I got pretty good at basketball. I'd say, "God, "if this shot goes in, "the next time we have a math test, "Miss Keane is gonna look up and I'm gonna look up when it's all quiet "in the classroom. "We're just gonna look at each other." Whoosh. Swish. She used to drive me home after practice. And I would just sit there in the car... She kissed me for the first time in the car. I know that we were together, but I don't remember it like... going to get ice cream or going to dinner. I don't remember anything. I just remember breaking up and her moving schools and not knowing where she was and just never... seeing her again. But she wrote me this message. She's uh... She's married. So... She's not Ms. Keane anymore. And... I am so glad that I'm not 15 anymore. May I have some of that? See if you're next. Thanks. Okay. Um, I guess not many people know this, and... Of course, none of you guys would know this, but when I was in my early 20s, I was going to get married. And a week before I was meant to get married, I walked away. Um, I felt like I hadn't. I hadn't adventured. I hadn't seen the world. I hadn't made mistakes... and my fiancee, Elizabeth, who was a childhood friend, a childhood sweetheart, I guess, she didn't deserve that uncertainty. And I just wish... I wish I had been better for her and that I had the courage, I had had the balls... to, to... to not put her through that. But then the stupid thing was was that I just ended up working for my dad, going into the family business, and I didn't even fulfill my promise. I mean, I'm trying to, I'm trying to now. I'm trying. Had I known I was gonna to be in this situation earlier, I was kinda lost as a kid, you know, um... My biological father was gone, so my mom remarried, and she had these... I was... these two sisters, kind of insta sisters, stepsisters. And... for about... that was about two years... when they were out of the house, I would dress up in their clothes by myself. I created this... I guess it was some kind of alter ego, or I don't know if it was like this grandmother that I never had, who was sort of a father figure who made me feel like I belonged to something. Her name was Sophia and I would dress up, and... and become Sophia. I never told you this because you'd probably think I was crazy, but Sophia just kept me grounded for a while when I didn't know who I was. Feels good to say that. Congratulations. I feel like you need to wear the bella. Can you please give me the bella? I was waiting for that. There you go. It's a start. Yeah. Uh... Um... I don't know any of you guys. You're all strangers. I guess that's appropriate. I moved here to go to business school, and I got a scholarship that first year, and it was great. And I was like killing it. It was awesome. And I met a lot of interesting people and, uh, started getting to know, like, the business world out here, and I got a great internship at a great financial firm. That's what I do. Um, but... then I kind of got swept in a different direction. Um, I went on a trip with a bunch of people that I was interning with. This girl, and these older trader guys, and they're like, "We're gonna go away for the weekend." Um, I mean, just ended up like this island, um, in the Bahamas. And I was like, "What? This is crazy, you know?" And then... At the end of the trip, um, they paid me and the girl, and I was like, "You don't have to do that. We were just, like, on a trip." And they're like, "No it's... We know you're like, struggling in school." So it's been going on for a few years, and it's how I've made a living. I realize, like all these people that I'm meeting and doing this with "providing" who are just people who want to, like, connect and like, not be alone in the world, and I find that I'm just alone, um, when I get home because I've kind of chosen this life that's like, an easy way to make a buck. And I kind of feel like I have to be pretty closed off to not, like, fall for anybody or whatever. I guess I'm sharing all this with you because I think I am ready to end that chapter of my life and start a new chapter where I am truly, like, connecting and finding someone that I wanna be with. And start a family, so... I know we're here for our first date. I know you didn't know any of this. Uh, there's that. That's a lot. Can I borrow some of your clothes? Yeah. I know I have great clothes. It's crazy. I'm gonna miss that part. Okay. Do I have to go? Halloween and, like, this time of year is always feels a little weird for me. So when I was in college, I had, um, a boyfriend who I really thought I was going to marry. Um and we... We wrote music together and played guitar, and our songs were really stupid, but they were also kind of good, and people would like them and we'd have these little concerts. Um, one night we were at our friend's Halloween party and we came back home and we were both really drunk. We were, like, in our bedroom. And, um, things just started to happen, and I just felt a little too drunk. But he just kept going, and I was saying no and, but then it just kind of happened. And, um, the next morning, you know, we both laughed about it. He apologized for what happened, but, um, it happened again and happened a lot of times. I just kept justifying it to myself, and he'd apologize. And I just keep making excuses for him because I loved him so much. But every time that it happened, I felt like a little part of me, like, my power wasn't... It was diminishing, And I... I didn't call the police or I didn't do anything. And then, um, about a year later, I found that he was texting this other girl and he moved out. It took me a lot of years and therapy to realize that what was happening to me wasn't okay. I found out, um, that that next girlfriend that he had, um, the same thing happened to her. And I just wish that I had said something. Oh, sorry. A plus... It feels good to laugh. Your turn. Oh, wow. Okay. So some of you guys know I moved here about three years ago and it was really scary. I didn't know anyone. Um, and, it was kind of an intimidating place to feel alone. Uh... But I met some amazing people who took me in. Suddenly, it kind of went from being this unfamiliar, scary place to... To home. And, that realization was pretty amazing for me. But there was one person I met who I knew pretty quickly that I didn't just wanna be friends with them. Um... I felt something more. Um... But I was terrified to say anything. Um... But there's something that I admire so much in this person. This comfort in being themselves kind of inspires me and, I guess this is the night with an unpredictable end. Um... And I feel like maybe now would be the time that I... That I let them know how I feel. I... Is it Ryan? Yeah. You wish. Yeah, sorry. It's just like that, it's so nice. I don't really feel like, honestly, I'm listening to that. And it's like I'm listening to it. I'm like, he's talking about me? I'm like... Hoping, you know, that you were. There's still just a part of me that's like, "Couldn't be, couldn't be you." I just feel really unworthy. Already nervous, but was great going around the circle. Like, what are you going to say? Like all of these things are so important, so big and... like, what do you have to contribute to share? I just felt like anything that I have to say would be inadequate. And I spent, um, I spent a lot of time feeling inadequate, just so dumb because I'm pursuing this thing where it's like you need to believe that you are enough, are more than enough. And I'm supposed to be, like, so confident. I know I come off that way but it's like a lot of times when I feel insecure, I just get louder. Um, my friends from high school be like, "Oh my God, you're so brave. "You're so brave for going after what you really want." And it's like, I feel like I'm just going through the motions of, you know, taking odd jobs, like making ends meet, like going on auditions and all that stuff. That's like, it's like, that's the easy part. And what is much harder is actually thinking that you deserve it. And I just don't feel that way. I just don't feel that way. Maybe you guys are gonna kiss or what? It's the last time I hang out with you guys. Fucking storm, now this. I'm perfect. So... I'm not perfect. I had a friend in college and we were friends for a long time. We ended up hooking up and she got pregnant, and um... I didn't show up for her. I sent money. I feel like my absence that day was really violent. I always ask why I'm not with anyone. I think I kind of blew it. I fuck up and that's it. That's... That's the move that you made. You can't get it back. Tim. Um, okay. This is something that I've been keeping from everybody, but, um, mostly from Joe. A couple weeks ago, I started looking at rings. And this is not a proposal, because I don't have a ring right now. All right. All right. I just... I just wanted to let you know the reason I don't have a ring yet is because I wanted to use my grandfather's ring. And when I asked my grandma if I could use it, she wouldn't give it to me. Shit. She said no. I love her and I know she loves me. And sometimes, you told me this, actually, sometimes when you love someone, you have to let them go. I don't think we need a ring. - I know you would like a ring. - I would love a ring. It'd look great. You would look great with the ring. So I'm glad that we can start talking about our future together. - I love you. - I love you. Plenty of time. I'm gonna be such a bridezilla, but, like, nice, I'll be a nice bridezilla. So you guys, most of you know that I come from a pretty well-to-do family. I'm Joseph the third. My mom's a doctor. Dad's a lawyer, so... but they were also very, pretty liberal. Like I never had to come out. Like my mom's brother's gay, My dad's best friend's a lesbian. So it was never a thing like... When I was eight, my mom took me to a Cher concert. She was like, " I knew you'd like it." Um, so I was always, like, you know, it was a good house to grow up in. I think the trap, if anything, for me and my sister was that we had successful parents, uh, we had black, successful parents, like an Upper East Side family of color. Like that's a lot of pressure, like, you do not come home with anything less than an A. So I think that weighed on Natasha and I. We just became best friends because we had that in common. But that success thing was really an issue. I mean we were in college. I was a sophomore. She was a senior. She started taking Adderall, um, and then pain meds, and then cocaine and barely graduated college like in and out of rehab all of a sudden and overdosed like four times and... It was a lot, and, you know, my big sister just kind of changed. She shifted. One minute, it's like, "I'm sorry. I want to be better. "I'm gonna do better. I'm just..." and then the next minute it's... She's lying and she... She's breaking into Mom and Dad's. She's breaking into my place. She's stealing. And the 17th time she went into rehab, my mother was like, "Listen, this is it. "Like it either sticks or we're done. We can't... We can't do this with you anymore." And then she disappeared. At this point, I'm in grad school. We moved in with each other. Had a job. We're talking about starting our business and she shows up at my door. Ninety pounds, unrecognizable, talking about she's hungry, needs money for food. And I'm... It's like we grew up in the same house, you know, like we had the same parents, the same opportunities. Like what? What? So you know, I did what you're not supposed to do. I gave her money, just like get out of my face. And a week later, she overdosed for the fifth time, and she didn't survive, and I felt happy it was over, you know, like, she was out of pain, sure, but my mom... Oh, sorry. Oh, God. Now everyone's looking at me. I'm last. Hold on... liquid courage. I don't have like a big confession. So much is like no one ever asks me how I'm doing. I don't know. This is a stupid story. Um, when I was younger. - Hello? - Come in. Hey. Hello. Come in, come in. This is our neighbor. - I'm sorry. She's so ruffled. - She's so scared. I've been baking all day. I heard you guys have people here. I just wanted to try this. Yeah, we heard that it's kind of like a meeting here. A party. - Yeah. - And we thought we can join you guys. Please come in. Okay, do you wanna come in my room where you can settle? A cute story. - Thank you for being this... - I'm Josh. - Hi, Josh. I'm Alex. Nice to meet you. - Hey, you too. - Are those butter walnut cookies? - Yes. - Oh, look at these. - I thought I smelled those. Oh, my God. - Oh, yeah. - You made these? Alex is a chef. He's like, got his finger on them. Are you guys hungry? - Yes. - Yeah? All right. I've been trying stuff out all day, it's for the new menu. - You want food? - Yeah! - Are you serious? - Yeah. I'll be right back. All right, guys. This is a garlic roasted chicken. Some Artisan flatbread. And this one's honey and some ice. You hear that, right? Oh, my gosh. It's our neighbors. - Downstairs, yeah. - Downstairs. She was an opera singer or something. Oh. Does she go to church? - Let's see if they're all right. - I'll go check on them. Oh, we're good. We just heard you singing through the floor. - Oh, no. Were we too loud? - No. No. - Please do. - Oh, we have plenty of food and water - and warmth and candles upstairs. - We're not starving but, I'm really packed full. You guys should come up. - Really? - Yes. I could go recruit some people. We could get you up there, if you want. Yes, yeah. We could absolutely... We have some strapping young men. May I present Mrs. Barbara Hirsch? - Hi! - Nice looking group. I think so. I think so. - Oh, guys, this is... - Mr. Hirsch. - Hi. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - My goodness. Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hi. Damien, this is my daughter, Olivia. We heard the Hirsch's moving around, and then we just followed the sound of fun. I think they called it The Great Northeast Blackout - in 1965. - Yeah, in '65. I was working with... Yeah, but you know, it wasn't really that scary. I think they called it "The Season of Love." Flower power children. It was... Wild, young woman, before I knew her. Well, I wasn't indulgent. And then, I think the next one... - '77. - 1977. Wow. She was in... - Bubbling Brown Sugar. - Bubbling Brown Sugar, and uh... This is going to be my first night on as the lead... and the lights went out. So, we just had to be there. About second act, it went black at 9:30. We had to walk home, you know, all the way from 52nd Street. Kind of romantic. It was romantic. - We're just so happy to be here. - Yeah. Thank you for inviting us. I've never been to a party in a long time. Take this piece... Look... Can you see them? You see all of them? It was in '80s, and I was on my way home, walking through Washington Square Park and a young man approached me, and he was asking for money to buy food, and... I said, "No, I'm not giving you any money." Come home with me. I'll fix you a hot meal. And he sat at the kitchen table, and he started sketching. It was so beautiful. It was... It took my breath away. And I bet you can't guess who that young artist was. - When was it? - '80s. Basquiat? He was in this building. - No, really? - Yes. And we have one of his works of art. - In your apartment right now? - Right now... - in my apartment. - In your empty apartment? Yeah, but the door is locked. I love that. It's pretty cool, huh? - It's been fun. - Yeah, it's been fun. I'm glad you came. And I think we're gonna be really good friends. - Oh, no! - I know, but... - Here we go. - Hey, listen. Okay. I'm pretty aware of my surroundings. Tonight would be the night. It's like, take your chance. - You know what I mean? - I think... You guys would be cute together. Okay. - You guys get any sleep? - I'm not. Sometimes, I'm come like sleeping and always watching with my other eye, you know, like this is close, and this is, like, almost open. It gets a little easier. I mean, she sleeps through the night. Now, I can't get her up in the morning. - It goes by quick. - Oh, my God. Yeah. I still remember. And now... she's a young lady. - You divorced or... - No, no. You're wiping your face with the boat? Olivia's mom, Sarah, she passed away when, uh... Olivia was about Siena's age. - I'm so sorry about it. - Thanks. If you ever need something, you just knock the door, and we will be there, okay? You come with us. Yeah, and she's getting old enough to baby sit. So, if you guys need to baby sit... - Please. - Okay, that'll be great for us. - Yeah. - It would be good. Four cheers. It's nice to meet new friends. Yeah. Cheers to you. I'm in drink number 10. - Okay. - And you? Go have a drink. You won't remember this conversation? - No. - Cool. - Okay. - All right, thanks. Give you a hand? Sure. Cool. I've never actually done dishes before. It's mostly the drying portion. Uh... perfect timing. Hang on. Classic. I'm sorry, I didn't get to hear the rest of your story earlier. Do you really wanna know? Yeah. I do. - Hey. - Hi, how're you doing? Yeah, of course. Yeah. - They're so cute. - Yeah. What was it like, having a baby? For me, it was amazing. It was the best experience I had in my life. I had a natural birth. - You got a natural birth? - Naturally, at home. No medication. Was it painful? Yeah, but it's not... pain. It's kind of strength. You have a lot of strength inside of you. You can probably pass that strength right under her. I hope so. This is a little tight. Thank you very much. All right. Somebody's jealous. I think it ties it together. It's perfect, especially with the feather in your hair. - I know. - Yeah. ♪ Sandy, you're a bitch ♪ No one is gonna Want you, Sandy ♪ After what you did ♪ No one is gonna Want you, Sandy ♪ After what you did I think so. ♪ Nobody likes you, Sandy ♪ Sandy, you're a bitch ♪ No one is gonna Want you, Sandy ♪ After what you did ♪ I hope you're real Proud of yourself ♪ I hope you're real proud of What you did ♪ Nobody likes you, Sandy ♪ Sandy, you're a bitch ♪ Sandy, you're a bitch ♪ I said nobody's Gonna want you, Sandy ♪ Nobody's gonna Want you, Sandy ♪ After what you did ♪ I hope you're real proud of What you did ♪ Sandy ♪ You've been a bad girl You've been real bad, Sandy.
