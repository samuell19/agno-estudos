Help me, please Not yet, sir. Raise it up to 350! What are you doing? Keep trying! Do something! Keep trying! You're a doctor! Save him! My brother can't be dead. Feel him. He's still warm! Bring him back! Jin-woo... Come on... Open your eyes... Open 'em... Listen to your big brother! Get up! Get up... Jin-woo... Let's go back home. Please... Jin-woo. Let's go home... Let's go home... Don't do this. Where are you going? Let go, man. You have to stay at his side. Let me go! Min-woo. Please... Look after Jin-woo for me. Where are you going? There's something I must do. But there are soldiers still out... And I'm sorry I can't keep our promise today. Don't wait for me. Head bomb! Hold on, hold on! - It's dynamite! - TNT! I bet there's a stack full of these at the Hwa-soon mines. It's not far! Let's go get 'em all! Yeah! And we'll turn those bastards into dust! They're all coming in dead! How can I save them! The ambulances are afraid to go out. We can't let them just die out there! Get me an ambulance! Who's coming with me? We gotta go out and help them! Come on! Who's with me! I'll go with you, sir. Okay, let's go. What's that! Stop it! Long live Korea! Long live Gwang-ju! The bastards... They're all insane! You fool! Go get 'em! Yes, sir! Shit... What's that! Hold your fire! Don't shoot! Please! Shin-ae... Over here, sir! The bastards... They're on their side. Shin-ae! It's me! Let's go. Get that bastard! Run away Shin-ae! Mister... Oh no... Please... Don't die... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Shin-ae. Oh no... Hurry up! What? Isn't that a MG50? Someone's shooting right at city hall from the rooftop of Jun-il bldg. What! That's well within reach! Send a chopper out to shoot him down! Sir! We need to evacuate! At this rate, we'll all be annihilated. Look! They're leaving! Boss! They're running away! May 22nd, In front of City Hall Citizens of Gwang-ju! The troops are completely gone! You bastards! Go back and eat shit! That's right! Eat shit! Hurray! Hurray! I wish this was all just a nightmare. My dear big brother. Get me a guitar next time. I decided I need a sister-in-law more than a guitar. Sorry, but I'm sick of your Kimchi soup. Shin-ae likes cross necklaces. Give it to her at the perfect time. Promise me you'll give it to her. I'll check to see if you do or not. Good luck, bro! Future Seoul Law school's top student, KANG Jin-woo. He hasn't moved an inch all day. And he won't say a word. I'm afraid he's going to die, too. It's not Chang-su. You're his friend but you got him wrong. My son has a nice big nose and is very good looking. This is not Chang-su. Something must be wrong. There's no way he'd be dead. Chang-su is a good son. He can't be a rebel. My son is not a rebel! No, he's not. I am PARK Heung-su, former captain of the special reserve forces. They defiled the soldiers' honor and thus no longer our country's army! They are the true rebels and conspirators! Though we may now have guns, We'll lose if we don't band together! So I humbly step up to form a civilian army. Are you with me? Yeah! Great! Now let's defend Gwang-ju with our lives! First, please step forward if you've been in the army. In-bong, didn't you... He went to Vietnam, sir. Special unit at that. He's a defense guard. What? You lying Vietnam chicken. So you ran through bullet fields to mail out military notices, huh? Man, the weather's hot just like in Vietnam! Some soldier! It's reassuring to have you step up. God was with us. Who'd have thought we'd win? Frankly speaking, we didn't win. We're now isolated, father. We'll run out of food and gas soon. Then there could be an even bigger atrocity. The committee's set on negotiating with the army, something will turn up. Let's go in. Look up there! What! That's Min-woo! Min-woo! What are you doing up there? What's he doing? He's not going to jump from there, is he? Oh, my god! Get down, Min-woo. He's right. The whole town is in mourning. The black flag should be up. Negotiate? They want the captured men released and a public apology. But they have guns! What negotiation! Block off all roads going into Gwang-ju. And make sure the surrounding areas are tightly secured. They're rats in a hole with no way out and will eventually starve to death. Look, the food's coming! Hi, Min-woo. - Holding up okay? - Why, sure. They gave us a lot of rice balls. Whatever you do, don't tell me to go home... If you ever end up alone in the fight, Drop your gun and go hide in any safe place you can find. Got that? No way. Why don't you kids ever listen! Okay. Min-woo. Be careful. Our injured brothers and sisters need your help. Please come to city hall and donate blood. Our injured brothers and sisters need your help. Please come to city hall and donate blood. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Ah... yes. She's not only pretty but has a heart of gold. A true angel. How many children do you have, chief? Just one daughter. - She must be very special. - Sure is. Her mother died when she was young but she grew up bright and loving. She must be pretty. I don't see it but people tell me to send her to beauty pageants. She must resemble her mother. Anyway, I'll never let go of anyone I love ever again. I'll protect her no matter what. - Thank you. - I'm glad I could help. Yong-dae. Oh, Yong-dae. Don't stick your ass out. Yes, honey. Now turn. I said nice and slow! I can't help it. Hi, Shin-ae. Sit here. Wow, an apple. Thanks. Let's share it. Here. It's hard... I heard amorists are good at breaking apples in half. Really? The apple's good. Gather around, everybody. What's this for? Look here everyone. That's good. Come on. One, two, three and smile. Got it? Don't pose like this then close your eyes on three! Okay, look at the camera. We're taking it this time. One, two... wait, wait, wait. - Hurry! - Wait. We got a problem. I'll have to rearrange a bit. Tall man with the big head. You're completely blocking someone! Do us a favor and move back. Father, don't you know you're a little short? That's better. And there's too many old men around our lovely nurse. - Come down here Min-woo. - I'll stay here. Come here. There, that's a better. Just the way I wanted. It's like a wedding picture. They look good together. Okay everyone. One, two... Will you please smile people? If you don't, you're a rotten egg. One... Father! You're the rotten egg? Good! One, two, three. This is the Cariba 50 a.k.a. M2 Browning machine gun. It can shoot up to 6800m at 600 bullets per minute. Take the glasses off, lad. It can shoot thru tanks and even shoot down planes. That's right! I shot with it. You'll need major arm muscles to handle it. Sit still, will ya? Wow, isn't this a bomb? It's a M18 smoke shell. It works like a hand grenade. When the enemy's in range, pull the pin... Be careful of the... No! He said 'pull the pin'! Blinded by resident spies and rebels, Gwang-ju citizens joined the protest and the situation elevated. About 30 military officials were lost in repressing the violent rebels. But there is no report yet of any civilian casualties. The government said the resident spies and rebels... Those bastards! Then what about my son! They were never on our side in the first place! Gather around everyone. Finally, the whole world is aware of what is happening here. The foreign affairs reporter told me that in 5 days we'll win. Not only that, there's an American aircraft carrier coming to Busan harbor. Let's not get too excited. The Americans coming is probably not for our benefit. If they were on our side, this wouldn't have ever happened. 5 days and we'll win? That probably means we only have 5 days left. What's wrong with you? Stop! Man, I gotta go badly... Hey! What are you doing there? We should always keep defense and be alert. You young fool. Aren't you afraid of that gun? No fears when there's no hope. What? Why would a young boy like you have no hope? People like you should have hope and live on. Live for what? You gotta tell the world how we were falsely charged and killed! It's the troops! Let me go! They're all... coming after us. I saw rows and rows of tanks. Man, we're all done for, now. You mean the chief was right? Where's the thing? You mean, the rebels sent this? Yes, sir. They claim that the basement at City Hall is full of boxes like this. Pull the tanks out of there, now! The chief is here. Chief, the troops went back with their tanks. Who sent it? Who sent the TNT? I did, sir. You risked the people's lives! They were sending in tanks! What were we supposed to do! What did you do, chief? Do you really want to be a rebel? What? A rebel? - You're calling us rebels? - Min-woo, stop. - Let go! - Min-woo How are we rebels? We're not the rebels! Min-woo. Stop the fuss and follow the tides. General Jeon thinks very highly of you. The army is a big organization itself. It can't create another body within. That organization is rewriting history. Accept it. - Let me meet General Jeon. - What? You can't do this. The people will use the TNT as a last resort! That kind of threat won't work on me! Your men will all die! Did you know that bicycles can be insured? But our aircraft carriers can't. Do you know why? It's military property. Soldiers are military property, too. Let them blow up the TNT! That'll blow up all of Gwang-ju? Then it'd be doing us a favor. Captain... We need to end this quickly. The foreign press is aware. The top is waiting for you to finish this, sir. All eyes are on your move commander. Please don't lose the opportunity. Send a final warning to them. We attack at midnight, tomorrow. On guard! Allegiance! Allegiance! Allegiance! At ease! At ease! The enemy! They're coming! The hell are you doing here! Hold your hands up high! Who cares! Just shoot the bastards! Stop. Captain. There's no turning back now. We're coming right for city hall. Please leave here before then. Captain, please... I appreciate it. Out of my way, please! Oh, my god. Honey! - Let's go home. - Why'd you come here? Let's go. Let's go home, hon. Please. Go back home. I'll be okay. Let's go. Look at your son. Please, let's go. Do it for our son and let's go home. Stop it, will you? Come on, hon. Go back home, man. Yeah, leave city hall to us and take care of your family. I'm so sorry. It's okay, just go. Thank you Min-woo. Let's go. Hey wait! Take this, Give this to Ms. Lee. It's a letter and some money. And this is for what I did to your cab. Please, don't... Now, go on. Don't do this... Let's go, hurry. - I'm sorry... - Come on, let's go. I'm begging you, Shin-ae. Please go back. Only those who need to stay are left. I need to stay, too. Why should you stay here? You know why. That day... I can't get it out of my mind. This is the only thing I can do. I have to help the injured and stay with them. Please, don't do this. Then why did you save me that day? You should've just run away. I don't want to lose someone I love again like that. Do you hear me? I'm so sorry Jin-woo. You'll send your girlfriend out but you remain in the jaws of death. Then I guess she'll end up being alone. Nurse PARK Shin-ae is your girlfriend? Are you spying on people now? Nurse Park has a pure heart of gold. What are you trying to get at? But she's as stubborn as an ox. Do you love my daughter? Answer me. Do you truly love Shin-ae? Take her and leave this place. But chief... You said you don't want to lose the one you love. Then why are you staying? I brought them in here. I must stay with them. Chief... Do as I say KANG Min-woo. Please don't tell me to go. I can't leave you here, daddy. Fine, then finish your rounds and come back. Shin-ae! Be careful. I'll go with you. Go on. Seal up all gates immediately. I repeat. Seal up all gates at once. Daddy. Entry will be strictly denied from now on. Daddy... No... Please... Do you hear me, daddy? Daddy... daddy... Please... daddy... no... I repeat. Don't let anyone in as of now. No, daddy... Can you stop the car? Here? Shin-ae... I... ah... I'd better get back. I'll protect the chief so don't worry. Oh, and this... Please keep this for me. It's something very special to me. I'll come for it in about 50 years. Min-woo! Tomorrow... Will you come to pick me up? What did you say? I said, please come and pick me up tomorrow! Of course! Wait for me, Shin-ae! Shoot directly at my orders. Citizens of Gwang-ju, The enemy troops are coming into downtown right now. Gwang-ju citizens! Our beloved brothers and sisters are being shot dead by the troops. My poor Chang-su... Citizens of Gwang-ju, The enemy troops are coming into downtown right now. Our beloved brothers and sisters are being shot dead by the troops. Let's all wake up and fight them to the end! We will fight to the end! We'll protect Gwang-ju no matter what! Everyone... Look at the people around you. They are your fellow soldiers who will fight in tonight's holy battle. Your faces are the mirrors of brave soldiers. Please erase the look of fear from your faces. We are fighting to live and to win. Let's fight bravely 'till the end! It is an honor to be at the side of my brave brothers. - Good to see you, teacher. - Good to see you. It's Mr. Kim. Father, what brings you here? I've come to meet the Lord. I want to be in the good fight before going to heaven. Well? Give me a gun, please. A good one at that. Why'd you come back? Shin-ae asked me to protect you. What she wants means more to me. Don't worry. I'll protect you, sir. What a gloomy mood... Did you say you were born in Hwa-soon? That's right. My mama's probably snoring in deep sleep right about now. I wish I could see my mama, too... Wanna bow in the direction of our hometowns? Good idea. Mother... Oops, my mistake. I bowed in the wrong direction. Are you bowing again? Don't shout. My mama will hear 'ya. - Mama - Mama - You said Hwa-soon. - So? This way is my hometown. That way was right for you. - Really? - Concentrate, will ya? My poor mama... 4 a.m. May, 27th Listen up rebels! You are completely surrounded! Drop your weapons, surrender, and you will live. You sons of bitch! Die! You fuckers! Go! Attack! You bastard! Hurry if you don't wanna die! Snap out of it! Hurry up! Get up! Sir... Everyone's dying! They're coming up the 2nd floor! Retreat!

I came here 'cuz of my son... But my poor wife... She'll be all alone... I am HAN Min-jae a grade 12 student at Gwang-ju High. Long live Korea! Long live Gwang-ju! He lied. He said he was in college. This is JANG Yong-dae. Yong-dae? Are you okay? Hi, chief... I ain't good... I got shot a few times. I'm on the second floor stairs. Don't say your location. They can hear you, too! It doesn't matter.

The incident resulted in 207 deaths, 2,392 wounded, and 987 missing people, but the exact number of casualties has been subject to considerable dispute. Members of the military government were indicted with rebellion but the culprit of ordering open fire against the citizens has yet to be identiffied.
