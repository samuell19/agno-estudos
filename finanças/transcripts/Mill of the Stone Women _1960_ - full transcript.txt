Excuse me, where does Professor Wahl live? Uh... Professor Wahl, the sculptor. I know he lives here, in a windmill. Oh, I see. Come with me. MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN - Is it far? - It's on the other side. Near the stone women. Sorry? That's what we call it - the Mill of the Stone Women. - Is that it? - No, further on. Past the cemetery at Veeze. Who's there? Von Arnim. Hans von Arnim. How can I help you? I have an appointment with Professor Wahl. Alright. Come in. Wait here. Sir, the professor wants you to wait in his studio. - Yes, but... - This way, please. Please go in. Stop, Conrad! Not so fast. Do you understand? - Hans von Arnim? - Yes. Professor Gregorius Wahl. Why didn't you let me know your plans? I'd have told you to stay in Rotterdam. Professor Caran sent me. I'm his assistant. He said he'd tell you... He should have waited for my reply. Why such haste? My publisher's deadline IS approaching. The monograph needs to be ready for the centenary. Of course! I hadn't thought of that. That's right. Next February it will be exactly 100 years since my great-grandfather first opened it to the public. So, when can you start? Tomorrow. Professor Caran has given me ten days. Ah, no. You're here now - why not start right away? I have very little time to spare, so you'll need to be quick. Well... Follow me, please. Conrad, check the braking mechanism. It's dangerous like this. Yes, Professor, I was just doing it. Please be careful. This floor is very cluttered. Here are the gears. They used to turn the mill. Now they make the statues move. - Are these the original statues? - For the most part, yes. I had to make some new ones. You'll have seen them in my studio. Very impressive! You made them yourself? I have to do everything myself. This way. Here. You can work here. It's very quiet. Look. I've sorted out some interesting documents for you about the history of the windmill. They're here for you if you want them. - Can I take them home? - No. I'd rather you didn't. I'll be able to help you with your work. I'd like all the writing to be precise and exact. I'll take a few days' leave from the academy. Oh, it's late. I have a lesson. You can work for three hours. The last boat leaves at seven. Don't miss it. Don't worry. One last thing. Everything needs to be done in five or six days. Good luck, Hans. Selma? Selma! - How are you? - I'm feeling better. I want to get some rest. Very well. Hey! Annelore! Annelore! Annelore! ANNELORE, I'D EVEN GO TO HELL WITH YOU! Not you too! I can't even get two lines right today. Nerves, dear Liselotte! You're always like this when Hans turns up. - You're such an idiot, Raab. - Shh! Ah-hah! You really have your head in the clouds today. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm just a little distracted. - Professor? - Yes? Did a Mr. von Arnim come to see you? Yes. Why? Do you know him? - We're childhood friends. - Ah, that's nice. He seemed like a serious young man, and I'm sure he'll do good work. Gentlemen. The exercise is finished. I can't come to the academy on Tuesday. We'll meet next Friday for sculpture. - Have a good evening. - And you, Professor. Four days of freedom... what bliss! - What are your plans? - I'm going to Darzen with Hans. - That's our home town. - Carpe diem, Lottie. If you let him go, next time you see him he'll have a white beard. I hope I manage, but it'll be a miracle. Stop it! Everyone else has left. Hans is waiting outside but he might go. Come on, hurry up. Excuse me, sir. Do you have a light, please? I think so. I asked for a light... Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Thank you very much, Mr... Von Arnim. Hans von Arnim. Bohlem. Dr. Bohlem. Have a good evening, Mr. Hans. Have a good evening. If you'll excuse me... My mom once told me, you aren't that great Use your ankles, they aren't that bad They're made for dancing - Ol√©! Hola! And if you have to move, they will be your allies This is the new dance that everyone loves The dance that entices you, it's the maxixe It'll pump through your veins at the centenary If you can learn it, you can dance it What do I care, I'm not good-looking My man is a painter and he adores me He painted me out like a shooting star What do I care, I'm not good-looking Shall I start over? I'll start over! Bravo! Bravo! - Good news? - Yes, I got a job at the Globe in Paris. - Top billing. - So I'll never see you again? No, but I'll send you a postcard. Goodbye, Raab. Best of luck, Annelore! Lottie! What are you doing here? Me? Nothing. I was watching the show... for free. You're so silly. I called at your house and you weren't there. I was worried. You don't usually worry about me. Alright, I'm sorry, but your professor made me work late. Satisfied? No? Then there's only one solution - dinner with me. Come on, cheer up. Oh! Now you're here I won't be lonely anymore. How are you? I should have learnt to dance instead of studying. And what have you been up to today? - Oh... playing bowls with Professor Wahl. - Would you like to order? How was Wahl? He gave me a deadline - six days to finish my assignment. I have to stay at the mill all day. Do you know him well? Do you know if he has a daughter? A daughter? Yes, I think so. Her mother died in childbirth. She has a strange name. Elfie or something. Elfie, that's right. What's she like? No idea. No one's ever seen her. Maybe her father doesn't let her go out. Or maybe she's so ugly that he keeps her locked away. Strange. Very strange. - Why? - Because she's pretty. Very pretty. Don't you get it, Raab? - How do you know? Do you know her? - No. But I do know... you. Did you say that just to make her angry? No, I'm telling the truth. I didn't think she'd take it like that. Do me a favor, Raab. Have a word with her. Here we go again. I'm Elfie. Hans. Hans von Arnim. Please come in. No. I can't, Hans. I can't now. There's always someone spying on me. Eyes watching me. Hans, I can't explain, but I need to see you. This evening. This evening... but where? Here... at the mill. It doesn't seem like a good idea. Someone might see us. Is it really so urgent? Yes, Hans. Please come at 11. They'll all be asleep. No one will notice anything. Take this. It unlocks the door to the mill. Please... you have to come. I'll be waiting for you. I'm tired. I'm going to rest. Let me accompany you. Good night, Papa. Good night, my dear. My compliments, Elfie. You were very good. I've never heard you play with such passion. It wasn't for you, Bohlem. I realized that. But don't forget, I'm the only one who really knows you. I'm the only one you can love, Elfie. Stop it, Bohlem. I'm sorry. Elfie. Elfie! Hans. You frightened me. Didn't you hear me come in? I was asleep, Hans. I'm sorry if I woke you. You seemed so keen to speak me. But when I saw you, you were so strangely still. I was dreaming, Hans. Dreaming that you were coming to see me from so far away. I was waiting for you. I was waiting like... I don't know. Like I always do. And at last you were here, close to me, and I didn't want to wake up. I wanted... the dream to continue. And I want it to continue now. It was a dangerous dream, Elfie. You don't know where it might lead us. Why don't you want this? Don't you like me? I like you, Elfie. But afterwards... That's not important. I want you. I'm here for you, can't you see that? Kiss me. Some friends of yours are waiting downstairs. - Who? - A young man and a girl. I'll go down. Don't be offended, but I think the statues are a bit more interesting. How long have we known each other, Lottie? I don't know. Forever. And you've always loved me? Yes. And you? I... didn't know that I loved you. It's only now that I realize it. Because it's only now... that I know what love means. Your love. But I don't think I deserve it, Liselotte. Why not? I'm ashamed to say. Then don't. Can you forgive me? For everything? Of course, Hans... I love you. I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING. NOBODY WILL BE HERE. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME EVERYTHING, OR ELSE. They scare me! The Poisoner of Poitiers. Stop! Stop! - What's happened? - A young woman feels unwell. Oh, Miss Liselotte. What's wrong? What happened? - I don't know. I don't understand. - Wait a minute. I should have something for her. Here... Get her to sniff this. It's nothing. She just fainted. She'll be fine again soon. It often happens here. How do you feel, Lottie? Better, thanks. But please let me get out of here. Yes, it's best if you take her outside. Hold on... Wait a second. What happened? It must have been your hat pin. Don't worry, it's just a little scratch. Up you get. Lean on me. Good girl. I'm sorry to be so much trouble. No, please... Not at all, Miss. Just think about feeling better. I'll see you in our lesson next Friday. Thank you. Could you please come and see me before you go back to your studio? Yes, Professor. I'm sorry I can't come with you, but I have to go back to work. I want to finish it quickly. - We've got our trip to Darzen, right? - Yes. - Goodbye, Raab. Thank you so much. - Goodbye. Well done! You've caught him. Of course. May I? Please, come in. Listen to me. It may seem strange that I'm taking up your time to talk about things to do with my family. But you'll understand. I have a young daughter... Elfie. She's very ill. The same illness that killed her mother. Unfortunately science can't do anything for her. All we can do Is try to prevent the worst. That's why Dr. Bohlem lives here. He's always ready to help, to watch out for symptoms, to take action before she has an attack. Does she know how serious it is? Sadly she doesn't understand. She doesn't know that she can't live like other girls. It's vital that she doesn't feel any emotion or distress... or her life will be in danger. You seem an honest young man. I hope you understand why I wanted to tell you about my daughter. It's a request and a warning. If she has an attack, it could kill her. You can count on me. I knew I could, Hans. Please... Back to work. I was waiting for you, Hans. I knew you'd come back. It wasn't because of your note, Elfie. Forgive me. I was desperate. I don't know why, but I had a premonition that you didn't want to see me anymore. That you didn't want to come back. I should have given that note to your father. But that would have been unkind to you. And cruel to him after he trusted me, even though I betrayed his trust. So you'd renounce me, renounce my love because of my father? That's not the only reason. We made a mistake, Elfie. We were foolish and we mustn't do it again. But I love you, Hans. I love only you. Do you understand? Others have taken advantage of my loneliness, of my inexperience. Maybe that's why you blame me. That's what's driving you away. You're unfair. If only you knew how horrible my life is. Alone, locked up within these four walls. I do understand, Elfie, and I've no right to blame you for anything. But I can't mislead you. I don't love you, Elfie. So what? As long as you let yourself be loved. As long as I can be with you. Take me away. Far away from here. I'll follow you wherever you want to go. Please, don't say these things. You know it's impossible. You have to stay here. It's best if we end this straightaway and forget about everything. Hans, you can't keep lying to me. You love that girl. I know. I saw you. But nobody will take you from me. I will kill you. Stop it, Elfie! Stop this nonsense. You're crazy. Yes... Yes... And that's why I want you. My... my... Elfie! Elfie! Elfie... Dead! Good morning, Mr. Hans. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. I was just clearing up. What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I want to speak to Professor Wahl. It's very urgent. The professor hasn't called me yet. I understand it's not a good time, but I really need to see him. I'm sorry, sir, but I can't disturb him. It's only just seven o'clock. He'll call me soon. If you'd like to wait... What is it? What do you want? I didn't know you were there, sir. I came to tidy the room. One moment, Selma. Yes, sir? Come in. Has anyone been in here since yesterday evening? No one ever comes in here. And this rose? Did you bring it? I don't have time to pick flowers. May I? - Selma, please leave. - Yes, Doctor. Professor Wahl wants to see you. Yes, I'll go now. What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? No, it's nothing. You don't look well. Do you have a fever? You've cut yourself... Leave me alone. I told you, it's nothing. You can't see the professor in this state, no matter what caused it. And I suspect it was something serious, from the way you look. Sorry, I'm very shaken. I see. Let me see... What can I give you? Ah, yes. A tranquilizer. That will put you right. There. Two of these tablets will calm you down. Go on, take them. Now you'll feel better. Murderer! - You're a coward and a murderer. - No... You must believe me. That's why I came here. I wanted to talk to you... to tell you the truth. Words! Pathetic excuses! You took advantage in the most shameful way of the hospitality I gave you. As a father, I opened my heart to you. You knew about the illness that threatened my poor Elfie's life and you killed her. That's the truth. You killed her. - You killed her! - No! - It's not true! It's not true! - I don't want to know. Guilt or fate... No one will bring my daughter back now. Elfie's dead. Elfie's buried. She's resting in peace. No one must dare insult our memory of her. No one must ever know. No one. Elfie is in her tomb in the cemetery at Veeze. She must rest peacefully in her eternal sleep. In peace. In peace. In peace. - What... - Shh. You are ill. Very ill. There was blood... here. Blood? Why? Why? Why blood? Elfie! Elfie! Elfie's dead. Elfie's buried. In the cemetery at Veeze. She's resting in peace... in the tomb. In the tomb... It's not possible... It was here. Open up! Open up! Mr. von Arnim. What are doing here at this hour? What do you want? What's happening? Where's Professor Wahl? I want to talk to him. Calm down, young man. What's got into you? - Who's that woman tied up? - A woman? - Don't lie. I saw her imprisoned in there. - Here? Young man, you're mistaken. One moment. There. Take a look. This should put your mind at rest. Where's Professor Wahl? I want to talk to him. - Where is he? - You're crazy. Calm down. Out of my way! Professor Wahl! Professor Wahl! Professor Wahl! Professor Wahl! Open up! Open up! Who's there? - Professor Wahl! Professor Wahl! - Calm down. Conrad. Leave him be. - What's going on? - Professor, I need to talk to you. Light those. Right now? At one in the morning? I tried to make him understand but he's in a real state. Something's going on here. I want you to explain... Mr. von Arnim. I hope you realize that you're the one who owes me an explanation. Professor... Earlier today I told you everything and you made me swear never to mention Elfie again. Elf fie... What are you talking about? Who spoke to you about my daughter? And what do you think is going on? Can you really not remember? Or maybe you don't want to. I'm starting to understand. You want to deepen my remorse and give me nightmares. No. No! I'm not guilty. It wasn't my fault! You're completely insane. Nightmares? Fault? What are you raving about? Typical schizophrenic hallucinations. No. You want me to believe that Elfie's alive. The bracelet... What about the bracelet? It was there on the table. And then... Then it was on Elfie's wrist in her tomb. Elfie? Elfie in her tomb? - What tomb are you talking about? - In the cemetery at Veeze. Where you said she's buried, Professor. And she's there. In her tomb. Dead. Dead! Not alive! What's happening? Hans. No... No! Hans... Why are you all here? - And why are you shouting? - It's nothing serious, Miss. Calm down, Elfie. It's just a little discussion. Go back to your bedroom. Bohlem, go with her. Conrad. Young man... I'm no doctor, but nevertheless I can tell that your mental state poses a threat to the peace of my home and to Elfie. Yes, Professor? Get the carriage ready to take Mr. von Arnim into town right away. Yes, sir. And you... come with me. You have a lot of explaining to do. That's ridiculous. You're lying, Bohlem. Hans isn't crazy. He came to see me and you stopped him. Don't deceive yourself, Elfie. You have to forget him. Never! Never. Hans is my life. Hans is your death. I... I am your life. Your salvation. You are bound to me forever. To a creature like you? Not anymore. And what would your Hans say if he found out who you really are? You won't talk, Bohlem. You're too cowardly to risk your life. Leave me alone. The carriage is ready, Professor. Alright. Oh... After all you've told me, you understand that you absolutely cannot be in this house after today. You must even forget that you were ever here if you don't want people to think you're crazy. After you. Farewell, Mr. von Arnim. I hope you make a speedy recovery. At last! Bohlem, we've done it. My plan was the right one. I have to admit that your tricks worked perfectly. And the drug you gave him removed all boundaries between reality and hallucination. He'll never be able to tell anyone about what happened without the risk of people thinking he's insane. Maybe. But I still think the other solution was better. No! It would have been too dangerous to kill him. Everybody knows he was coming to my house. As long as Hans is alive, he's a threat. Your daughter's in love with him and will do anything to see him again. She'll forget him in time because Hans will never come back here. What he experienced would destroy anybody's brain. But there's one fact that can't be erased, even from a disturbed mind like his. What's that? - He saw Elfie die. - So? He held her lifeless body in his arms. That was another hallucination. He doesn't have any concrete proof to lead him to the truth. I hope you're right. I shudder to think he might see your daughter again. He could ask her questions and investigate and discover that she's been dying and coming back to life for three years. He could find out how we bring her back to life. And that would be the end for us... and for her. If that happens, I'll try your solution. Elfie! - Another attack. - Quick, Bohlem! I'll save you, Elfie. I'll save you once more. Check everything, Bohlem. I'll do the rest. Professor, help me. Set me free. Yes, little Annelore, I'll set you free. Stay calm. You won't suffer anymore. You just need to wait a little while longer. Just a little while longer. - Everything's ready, Professor. - Good. Give me the syringe. See, Elfie. Your bad blood is leaving you. It's flowing away. Just a few more seconds. Ready, Doctor. Quick! Bohlem! Yes, Professor. How is he, Doctor? Medically speaking, he's well. The rest did him good. He just needed a few days. I was afraid he'd lost his mind. It was just a nervous breakdown. A breakdown? That's strange. Someone's well and then suddenly... Indeed. An inexplicable acute case. - What could have happened to him? - I don't know. You're his friends, you'd know better than me. - What can we do for him now? - Nothing special. Entertain him and distract him. I don't think that should be difficult. You're young. - Thanks, Doctor. - Not at all. - Please. I'll show you out. - Thank you. Miss. So what did the doctor say? Is it all over for me, or is there a glimmer of hope? It's bad news, Hans. You're well again. Now you'll be able to get up, go out and escape from me. You're so selfish! You were happy playing the nurse, with me lying here all defenseless. I guess I am a bit selfish. And I loved to hear you calling me all the time. You'd say, "Liselotte, I feel so ill. "Liselotte, don't leave me. "Liselotte, hold my hand." I must have been really sick. Go ahead and make fun of me. - I don't believe you anyway. - Why not? Because you gave yourself away when you were sick. And now I know that you love me. You know that? And do you know when I can get up? In two or three days, if you want. That's too late. - Hans! What are you doing? - No, no, no, that's too late. There's something I need to sort out by tomorrow. I want to go to Darzen to ask the parents of a certain young lady if they agree to give their daughter to someone like me. Hans... really? I think you should help me this time. For three years I refused, and I still do. I'm a doctor, not a sadist who turns women into stone. Fine scruples for a doctor struck off the medical register, a sleazy jailbird like you. Don't forget that my statues are your salvation. I don't forget it, Wahl. But I still refuse to fill your macabre theater with corpses. All I have to do IS save your daughter's life. I could say I do it for the love of science, but that wouldn't be strictly true. I have no interest in your motives, Bohlem. As long as Elfie is cured. Don't forget it. I know, Wahl. - Professor \Wahl. - What is it? While you play with death, I've conquered it. As you know, I created a substance, a serum that can protect the red blood cells. But it wasn't enough. I needed to find an exact match for your daughter's blood group. It's extremely rare. - But now I've found it. - Ah. Your daughter can soon live like other women. Who is it? Liselotte Cornaim! 52 steps! We could have waited downstairs and whistled to her. - Liselotte! - She's still sleeping. Liselotte! Who's there? What do you want? Oh, it's you, Mr. Hans. - Are you looking for Miss Liselotte? - Yes. She's not home yet. Not home yet? She was expecting us. - She might have been. - What do you mean? Well, I don't know if I should say... Come on, tell us. The young lady hasn't been here since yesterday evening. And she didn't... leave a message for me? Nothing at all, or I'd have told you. Maybe there's a note in her room. Well... I can let you in. Why has she left her bag here? Maybe she took another one with her. No. She wouldn't have left her papers and her money behind. How is this possible? There could be any number of reasons. Hey... What's wrong? - This girl... - What about her? She's a redhead. Yes, she's got red hair. So what? It's her... It's definitely her that I saw. What do you mean? You'll have seen her in the bar. No, I'd never seen her before that night. How can that be? How can it all have been a hallucination? Will this nightmare never end? Listen, Hans. I asked you some questions when you were ill. You wouldn't talk about it, so I gave up. But now things have changed. That girl with the red hair is Annelore, a model. You say you saw her one night. Where? In the basement... tied up. Where? In the basement of the windmill. Hold on a second, let's think this through. Annelore said she was leaving for Paris. She was supposed to pose for us, but she didn't turn up. If you'd never seen Annelore before, you couldn't have recognized her from the photograph and known that she had red hair. So it couldn't have been a hallucination. You must have seen her in that basement. So then... it's all true. What's all true? You need to talk, Hans. You need to tell me. What happened to you? Come on, tell me. The blood hasn't altered and the red blood cell count is normal. We can operate on your daughter tonight. Are you sure about all this, Doctor? There's no risk to Elfie? No risk at all. Then I agree, we'll operate tonight. We need to clear everything out of here. Help me, please. Tell Conrad that this statue has to be in the carousel this evening. - He needs to be ready. - Alright. It's a nasty situation. Some of the things you've told me are absurd, but others are definitely true, like Annelore. How do you explain her being down there in that horrible basement? I don't know, I don't know. There are still a lot of things I don't understand. We need something else - evidence, physical proof - to demonstrate that your story Is true and really happened. Of course! The cemetery! The cemetery at Veeze. Just like you said. Empty. It's empty. So... Wax... A wax dummy! The thunder scares me. When I was little, I used to hide under the bed. But you weren't afraid. No. Because you weren't alone like me, in this dark and gloomy house. Did you already know Hans then? Did you run to him for comfort? How wonderfully exciting it must have been... to tremble in his arms. But that's all over now, Liselotte. Hans will love me now because you won't be here anymore. Because your life will be mine. Here, in this serum, is your daughter's life. Three years of meticulous work, Wahl. One minute into the transfusion, the serum will be introduced here, where it will automatically be mixed with the new blood. Without this serum... the red cells wouldn't be strong enough to survive. The body wouldn't be able to regenerate them and so they'd die. They'd slowly be destroyed, like with a cancer. We'll have to give your daughter a light anesthetic. The liquid may cause a painful reaction. Apart from that, it will be a straightforward operation. No risks. I'm proud of you, Bohlem. You've thought of everything. Almost everything. Hans! We're not making a mistake, are we? It doesn't matter. This is about Liselotte. - What do you want to do now? - Go to the basement. - We need a lamp. - Over there, by the door. Stop it! Go on! It's a corpse... a corpse turned to stone. It looks like... Annelore. Liselotte! - She's down there. - What do we do? We need to be quick. Come on! Everything's ready, Professor. Good. Let's get to work. One moment, Professor Wahl. What is it? This will be my last operation. Elfie won't need my medical assistance anymore. Of course. And? You know that I've spent years saving her from death. I've committed terrible crimes for her. And now I'm going to give her a new life. Your point? I have the right to be recompensed. - I've never quibbled about money. - I don't want money. So what do you want? I want your daughter, Wahl. Do you realize what you're saying? Yes. I love Elfie. I've loved her for years. And it's thanks to me that she's still alive. Elfie must be my wife. Your wife? You think I could give Elfie to an abject creature like you? A vile monster, rejected by society? If it weren't for me, you'd still be in jail. Don't forget that! I don't forget anything, \Wahl. But now I'm the strong one. It's the first time in my life that I've wanted something, and now I'll have it. You're deceiving yourself, Bohlem. Not only will you never have my daughter, but I will never accept that she owes her life to a foul creature like you, Bohlem. For me, you were nothing but an instrument. Enough! I no longer need you. Your fate is sealed. The only face my daughter will see when she comes back to life will be mine. Only mine. By killing me... you've killed your own daughter. It's no use. There's another way, through Wahl's studio. Quick! Tonight you'll be cured. You'll be cured forever, Elfie. I will give you life. I'll do it all by myself. It's here, Raab. Where is it? Where is it? Bohlem, you wretched creature! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? It's gone... It's gone! It's gone! Liselotte! Quick, Raab, hurry! Liselotte! - She's still alive. - Untie her, quickly. Elfie. Elfie... Elfie! Dead! You killed her, damn you all! You will all die! Al of you! All of you! Quick, go through. This way. We'll go through the house. Be quiet! Stop it! Be quiet! Damn you! THE END
