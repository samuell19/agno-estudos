(light music) (wind howling) (metal clanging) (tense music) (metal clanging) - How much? - How much for what? (trucker sighs) I just need a ride. - I'll give you 20 bucks. - I just need a ride up to Phoenix. - [Trucker] Okay, 40. Come on you little faggot, who you kiddin'? I'll, I'll give ya 60 bucks and I'll drive ya up there. (tense music) You been in? - Got out yesterday. - Good, pretty boy like you musta got some practice, huh? - Yeah. 60. - Well, come on. You son of a bitch. Motherfucker. (somber music) (car engine rumbling) - Could take you to the airport right now. - I have to take care of my dad. - No, you need to leave before Eric shows up. - I want him to show up. - No, no, you're going back to school. - Did Eric ask for money? - I don't have any anyway. Hiding my car so it doesn't get repossessed. - Did you tell him I was gonna stay? - He didn't ask about you. Is that your dad? - I better go. - I thought you said he couldn't get outta bed. - Heather. - [Tommy] Is he drunk? - They can't get his medication right. - Where were you? - [Heather] I was at a meeting. - Right, an all night AA meeting. - [Tommy] Went to a pancake place for her birthday. Did you realize it was her one year AA birthday? - You shut up. - [Heather] Just give me a second. - [Tommy] It gets stuck. Back off! - [Heather] Daddy! - He's drunk, you can smell it 10 feet away. - He's dying! - Heh, he also drunk. - Daddy, what is this? - I handled it. - What did you take? Are you drunk? - You said you were going by the pharmacy. I waited up all night. - [Heather] I get my car back from the garage in a few hours. I'll go to the pharmacy after. - Who was the guy? It's a pretty fancy car. - Daddy, he's gay. Let me by. (dog barking) (dog yelps) - [Eric] Hey! - [Marcella] Don't undo that. - Hey Ma, miss me? - Tangled up for a reason, so that he wouldn't jump over the fence and hang himself. So, Mr. Smartypants is outta jail. What's your next brilliant plan? You gonna sell your ass to that slimy child molester again? - No, I'm sober. - Yeah, me too. - He didn't have any water and it doesn't look like you've been feeding him either. - He bit one of the neighbor's kids. He's gonna get put to sleep. - What neighbor's kid? - He snapped at one of the neighbor's kids. He got out front, and they said Animal Control's coming to put him to sleep. - When? - I don't have the exact dates, get outta my yard! - I'm here for my stuff! - Yeah, next time you come to this house, maybe bring back my mother's silver. - I need my stuff! (ominous music) - [Marcella] I'm calling the police! (dog panting) (Eric sighs) (sullen music) - I got out. Yesterday morning. - That's, I'm glad. - I wrote and-- - [Heather] I didn't get anything from you. - What? No, I sent them. - You have to go. I'm leaving at like five o'clock in the morning and I have to drive all day. - Leaving where? - Back to school. I'm gonna see if I can get into the dorm early. - How'd you get back in? - I caught up. I went to this treatment place and then I caught up. - That's great, good for you. I almost got my equivalency while I was in, but I got into a fight with this guy-- - I've gotta wake my dad up. - What, you turn back into a goody two-shoes when I was gone? - [Heather] No. - I have to make you bad again? - You have to go. - [Eric] Uh oh, are you gonna make me sing to you? ♪ Don't lie ♪ ♪ Don't even try ♪ ♪ Your lips tell me who ♪ ♪ But your heart whispers no ♪ ♪ I want to love you ♪ ♪ So don't try to lie ♪ (Heather laughs) - [Heather] You are such a cheese ball. - But you liked it. I can sing it again for you, real quiet in your ear. Take a while for you to hear it all though. A few hours at least. - A few hours? - It's an epic. Come out here with me. You don't have to leave yet, do you? - I can't stand being here with my dad. - [Eric] Stay with me. - Where? I'm gonna get an apartment, I have some money now. - Eric, that's not enough for an apartment. - [Eric] Tommy's gonna help me. - Tommy's broke, they're trying to repossess his car. - Remember this? Me, you, and Merlin? Just like a little family? - I'm going back to school. - Promise you'll stay till New Year's. - [Bert] Heather, who you talking to? - That's my dad. - [Eric] I'm not afraid of him. - [Heather] I'm on the phone. - Why is the door locked? - [Heather] Daddy, I'm allowed to have a little privacy. - [Bert] There's nobody on the phone. - I was on my cell phone. (tense music) - Where ya going? - I'm leaving. - Why? Great. I told the home health nurse didn't need her till the first week of January, but you see how well I'm doing. Merry Christmas, Daddy. - Why are you even up? You said you didn't sleep all night. - [Eric] The talking woke me. - [Heather] Take something. - They don't work. - [Heather] Go lay down. - Don't leave. - We'll see. - I need a drink. To sleep. (sullen music) (people chattering) - [Mickey] We're closed until 4:30. - Tommy? Hey Mickey, is Tommy here? - [Mickey] You need to get the hell outta here. - Tommy's gonna give me a job. - Tommy does not give out jobs, I do. - Eric, hey. - [Mickey] Tommy, let me get rid of him for you. - Hey Tommy, it's so cool you started doin' AA. I got into AA at the institute. - Really? How long you sober? - Two weeks. - How much pot are you smoking? - I'm sober. - [Mickey] And you think we can't see how red your eyes are right now? - I was hitchhiking all night. Tommy, can I talk to you please? - He told you to stay away from him. - [Eric] No, he didn't. - Yes he did, I helped him write the letter. - No, I don't need you to protect me, Mickey. - [Mickey] Yeah, you do, yeah, you kinda do. - You dumped me, remember? I'm not your boyfriend anymore. I can take care of this. - What letter? - I didn't send it. - Your ex is fucking toxic. You're never gonna stay sober hanging out with people like that. - [Tommy] I seem to be doing okay so far. - Hands are shaking. - I had too much coffee. - You sure it's not me? Making you nervous? - Maybe, what do you want? - You said you could get me a job? (Tommy sighs) - [Tommy] I shouldn't have said that. - Well, you said I could stay with you. - [Tommy] I shouldn't have said that either. - I didn't make any other plans. - Why don't you stay with Heather? Isn't she madly in love with you? - She's staying with her dad, I can't stay there. - Well, I don't wanna be your second choice. Besides, I'm back living with Mickey. You can't stay with me either. - I told my parole office I had a job. I told him I was gonna be staying with you. - [Tommy] Your plan's changed. - They'll put me back in prison. What am I supposed to do? - [Tommy] Here, get a motel. - Then what? - I don't know, find a job, get an apartment like anyone else. - How am I supposed to find a job just getting out of prison? - It's not my problem. - What, you're not my friend? - [Tommy] You don't care about me. - Yeah, I do. You're the guy I go to when I don't know what to do. You're like my mentor. - I don't wanna be your mentor, I'm in love with you. Why not? - I just. - I'm sorry, you have to leave. I can't be around you and not drink. - Tommy, people are ready to leave. You got what you came for, now get out. That's great Tommy, giving him drug money. - You don't just abandon people, Mickey. - Yeah, you do. And where did you get the money from? Is the register gonna be short? (people chattering) (ominous music) - [Heather] I didn't get it. - Well, then give me the money back. - I spent it on food. - [Bert] No, you spent your money on food. I want my money back. - No. There's no money in there, I'll go by the machine later. - What about in here? - Stop. - What, what, what? - Stop it! - You ticklish? (Bert laughing) Oh, you're a grown up lady now, don't like to be tickled. Didn't check in there did ya? - Oh, hey Benny, is Dolores here? - What the hell are you doin' here? - I just got out. - Really? Short sentence. - Got lucky with the parole board. - You already up for parole? - Um, I was wondering that maybe you and Dolores had some work for me? - [Benny] Really, you thought that? - Yeah, I though maybe. - Ah, you really lucked out with that parole board. Lucky you. - Benny, I didn't say anything. - Yeah, it'd be stupid if you did. - Eric, hey. - [Eric] Mama, hey. - If I was your mom, I'd have beaten you to death years ago. (Dolores and Eric chuckling) Hey, help me with this. Come on in. You can stay a little bit. Look at you, you look like shit. - I just need a shower. Look, I was thinking you might have some work for me? - I don't think you're quite right for my customers anymore. - [Eric] Well, let me clean up a little, we'll see. - No. - Well, I thought maybe I could stay in the basement again? - We're using it for storage. - I could rearrange some things. - No. - Do you know where I could earn some money? - Benny, we could have him-- - We're not looking for anybody. - Got 30 guys down there every night selling-- - Hey, I don't want him down there. - No, I want thinking of selling. If they caught me selling, I was thinking I could be a driver or something? - Driver. - [Eric] Something? - Well, if I open up a chauffeur service, I'll give you a call. Get you a little chauffeur suit with a little hat. - [Eric] Benny, I went to prison for you. - For me? You went to prison 'cause you're a dumb shit who didn't run when he had the chance. - [Eric] I would have killed myself first if I knew what was gonna happen to me in there. - Eric, you're just gonna have to find something else to do, okay? Come on. - I'll show him out. Congratulations on your early parole. (ominous music) (metal clanging) (staticky beeping) (muffled speaking on radio) (muffled speaking on radio) - See ya, Mer. (Merlin panting) Bye, bye, bud. (loud knocking) - What? - I was looking for Eric. - So are the police? - [Heather] Why? - What do you want? - I told Eric that I would stay until New Year's, and I have to leave early. Would you-- - Where's that halter top? - What? - You're that crack whore that used to wear the halter top. (Heather sighs) - Would you mind telling him that I have to leave early. - I'm not a messenger service. - [Eric] When's Mickey come back? - Not until after the dinner shift. What motel did you go to? - I slept in my mom's yard. - What'd you do with the money? - I'm sober, Tommy. - I asked you what you did with the money. - [Eric] I wanna get an apartment. - How much do you have? - 120. - Where'd you get the rest? - [Eric] I have some more hidden in a box at my mom's house, but she wont' let me in. - Did you break parole? - I'm not going back to prison, Tommy. I'd kill myself first. - Stop saying that, please. - She's gonna have my dog put to sleep. - When? - I don't know, soon. Please, I can't let him get put to sleep. Please. - This is not my problem. - Who told you to say that? This is not my problem, that's not you, Tommy. - [Tommy] Maybe it is now. - Even if I got a job today, it'd be months before I saved up enough to get an apartment. - You could go to a shelter. - [Eric] You ever been to a shelter? - You were in prison, you're afraid of a shelter? - Brought you something. Wore them the whole way back. You want 'em? - No. - [Eric] Yeah, you do. - Stop teasing me. - You like when I tease you. - You want me to have 'em? - [Eric] Yeah. - Why? - [Eric] I don't know. - You want me to be attracted to you. - I don't know, I don't care. - [Tommy] You're working awfully hard at it for not caring. - I just thought you'd like to have 'em. - You know what I think? I think you like me and you just can't admit it. Denial is part of the reason you drink. - You asked me for underwear before and I just thought you'd like to have some more. - I can't do this, you've gotta go. - Isn't there some AA thing that if someone comes to you for help and they're trying to stay sober, you have to help them? - I don't wanna see you again until you can admit you're in love with me. You have to leave. - What am I supposed to do? - I don't know. Whatever you did before you met. (tense music) (Eric sighs) (people chattering) - What are you doing here? - Talk to Benny. - You talked to Benny, he said you can be here? - Yeah. (tires screech) (gun banging) - Benny's not as patient as he used to be. You better make sure he really said you can be here. - Okay. - Okay, what? - Okay, I'm in love with you. - I know you are. Well, we're work on the kissing part. Come on. Hey, where you goin' with that? I told you I'd go to the bank. - No, I can take it. - Why can't I take it? - I didn't say you couldn't take it, Tommy, I'm just-- - You don't trust me. You know, it's really hard for me to get back to normal when everyone keeps treating me like a criminal. - I love you, Tommy, but you embezzled $50,000. - I'm six months sober. - Let's not talk about this in front of your friend. - We're hiring him to be busboy. - [Mickey] No, we're not hiring him. - I did the hiring around here for 15 years. What do I get to be around here other than a stock boy? I quit this job. I got nothin' to lose. - Brand new tile and paint. If you wreck anything, I'm keeping your deposit. - Okay. - And there's an extra $500 deposit for pets. - Yeah, I wish I coulda got ya something nicer. When I'm back on my feet, I'll, I'll get ya something really nice. - It's already nice. - You're nice. - Were you able to get the cell phone turned on? - They took it, said it was stolen. Did you steal it? - I got it from some guy, he must've stolen it. - Well, it just happens I had this one sitting in a drawer at home. You can use it. - Thank you, Tom. - Now, where are those briefs? - [Eric] Stay outta there. - What's the secret, mystery man? - Just let me get it for you. Stay out of there! (tires screeching) (Tommy sighs) - [Tommy] What are you doing? - [Eric] I'm just making sure the lock works. - It works, let's just go in. (Eric sighs) - I'm really tired. - [Tommy] I could give you a massage. - Let's just make the first time nice, okay? - [Tommy] It will be. - No, just give me some time to settle in. Have a bath. - I could give you a bath. - Tommy. - [Tommy] Doesn't that sound nice? A nice, warm bath. - I'm just saying, give me a day to get it together. I wanna make love to you. You said you love me, right? (Tommy sighs) I'm sorry, I'm being an asshole. I'm tried too. - [Eric] Thank you. - Go clean up. (sullen music) (turn signal clicking) - Where are we? We gotta stop at the pharmacy. - We picked up your prescriptions yesterday. - No, this is for something else. - [Heather] What something else? - None of your business. - You got a prescription from another doctor, didn't you? - I don't have to discuss my treatment with you. - [Heather] Yeah, and I don't have to drive you to pick up drugs either. - Oh, here it is, stop. (tires screech) Oh, Jesus. Would you mellow out? Maybe you should smoke one of those joints you got hidden in your underwear drawer. - Stay out of my dresser. (Bert chuckles) - Aren't you a pushy little bitch? Your mom was a pushy little bitch, but she had a bod that would let her get away with it. Nobody's gonna take any shit from you. Not with those little mosquito bites of yours. - Stop. - Wait for me. - Call a cab. What are you doing? - [Eric] Stealing this. - You can have it. - You stayed. - I have to get the alarm. - [Eric] I don't hear anything. - It has a delay, I have to go get it. My dad's sick. - Is that why you stayed? - I have to get it before it goes off. - Where is he? - He's on his way home, I have to go get it. (alarm blaring) (Eric chuckles) - [Eric] Sorry, I thought you were making it up. (Heather sighs) (phone ringing) - That's the alarm people. Yeah, everything's okay. Yeah, I'm his daughter. The code word is castle. What? Yeah, it is. I've lived here for 10 years, I know that the code word is. Check your records. - So? - So. - All moved in. You wanna come over? - My dad. - Your dad won't be there. Don't you love me anymore? - I'm not myself when I'm around you. - I like who you are when you're around me. (Heather sighs) - Just give me a second to think. - [Eric] Think about this. And this. (gentle music) - [Dispatcher] Stand by, Unit 23. (door slams) - How do I get out? - They're not here for you. My dad must've changed the alarm password when I left. It's okay. (loud knocking) - We got an alarm report for this address. - Yeah, I live here. I've been away at school, and my dad must've changed the password. - [Officer] You have an ID? - Hold on. (heels clicking) - [Bert] Let me get some money, I'll be right back. - That's my dad. - This your daughter? - She's not allowed in my house. - Daddy, stop it. - What would you like me to do? - [Bert] Can you arrest her for trespassing? Maybe search her dresser drawers or somethin'. - [Officer] If that's what you want. - [Heather] Daddy. - What, pumpkin? - Sir? - Honey, do you have any money for the cab? I was just kidding, Officer. I forgot to tell her the password. Coulda let them cart you off. - [Heather] Go out the window. - [Eric] Come with me. - No. - Right now. - [Bert] Is someone in there with you? Is that asshole in there with you? - You're hallucinating, you to bed. - [Bert] Open the door! - Come on. - [Heather] No. - I won't come back. (tense music) - I don't want you here. - The Pecan Tree Apartments, 32nd and Thomas. - I didn't mean to hit you. - I know. Let me get you some lunch. (Heather sighs) (Bert snoring) (bottle rattling) You're not really sick, are you? - Call my doctor. - I did, he wouldn't discuss it with me. - (sighs) I've got chronic aggressive Hepatitis B and C, complicated with cirrhosis. - So, you're drinking on top of that? - [Bert] My doctor said it didn't matter anymore. - No, he didn't. - Sit down a sec. - I can't stay here. - What am I supposed to do if you leave? - [Heather] Tell the home nurse to come back early. - She quit. - Why? - All right, she didn't quit, my insurance ran out. - Was there ever any home nurse at all? - Yes. No. I forgot to send my insurance forms in after I got canned. I have amnestic syndrome. It's part of the liver failure. - I'm leaving. - You know, I'll be dead in a few months, and then you can do whatever you want. Can't you put your selfish agenda on hold for that long. - No. - You saw the eviction notice? - Yeah, you said you handled it. - Well, I didn't. - You know, they'd have a really hard time evicting you if you were really sick and not just a drunk. - Great. You can just go off to school and wait for them to tell you they found your father dead somewhere. Is that what you want? - No. - What'd you do to your face? - It's from when you hit me. - You didn't do anything to make it worse? - No. - 'Cause you would do that a lot when you were little. You'd go in your room and you'd hit your own face to try and make it look worse and get me in trouble with your mom. - I don't remember that. - You're gonna leave me. If you leave, I'm gonna take every pill in this house. I will not be homeless again. - How long has he had cirrhosis? - [Heather] 10 years. - [Mickey] You can't have cirrhosis and drink like that for 10 years. You'd die. - He said he's got three months to live. - Really, and how long has he been saying that? - [Heather] You're not a doctor. - Why are you asking us for? - I was asking you, I was asking Tommy. - Okay then, Tommy, you've been clean, what, six months now? Let us have your expert opinion. - I think if you stay with him, you're gonna slip. - He needs someone to do the paperwork. I can't just let him get evicted. - [Mickey] Yes, you can. - And what about all his stuff? They'll just throw it outside. - If that's what it takes for him to bottom out, then that's what it takes. - He said he was gonna kill himself. - Some of us make it, some of us don't. You're making it worse by helping him. Do what you want. - He got evicted right before my mom died. She and I stayed at my aunt's and the landlord dumped all of our stuff onto the driveway. My dad said he was gonna rent a truck and put it all in storage, but (scoffs) when we drove back, he was just sitting in one of the living room chairs drunk while all these people rummaged through our stuff. I started screaming at them, but they kept on grabbing things and running away. He got sober about three months after she died. - Maybe he'll do it again, but if you stay there, you're gonna slip. - Eric asked me to stay with him. Would it be okay if-- - Bad idea. - [Heather] We're both sober. - [Tommy] I don't want you there. (Bert snoring) - They still have corners. - Sorry. - That feels nice. - What changed your mind? - The dorms don't open for a few more days. - Clothes are getting wet. Need some help with them? (Eric sighs) - I'm glad you're back. I'm really glad. - We have to go get Merlin. - Right now? - They're gonna have him put to sleep. We have to go get him. - Okay. - You scared? - No. - Hey buddy, hey Mer, hey Mer. How you doin'? Oh, come on, let's get you outta here, eh? (Merlin panting) Oh wait, his bowl, go get the bowl. Heather! (tense music) - I see you out there. You're in for a big surprise if you come in my house again. Hope you try it. 'Cause I'll be waiting. (door creaks) - Oh my god, oh my god, that was such a fucking rush. (both laughing) (Eric sighs) - Can you believe it? We did it, I mean, I have an apartment and a job, and we're all here. Just like a little family, and it's okay. You can go back to school. This is enough. This is what I wanted, I can die now. - What? How do you mean die? - Just meant that I'm happy. (pee trickling) Merlin, no. (Eric sighs) I'll be right there, I just need to grab some paper towels. Hey. What's the matter? - I'm not going back to school. - I just, I just wanted, you know, just for a minute. - Why just for a minute? I'm serious, I'm staying. I have to watch my dad and it doesn't have to be just for a minute. (loud knocking) (Merlin barking) - [Landlord] I told you it's a $500 deposit to have a dog. - I was coming to talk to you about that later today. - Nothing to talk about. Either write me a check for $500 or get the dog outta here. - I don't have a checking account, let me call Tommy. - It already smells like dog crap in there. Is that dog crappin' on my floors? - We'll clean it. - [Landlord] Are you movin' in? - Maybe, what of it? - I leased this apartment to two people. If there's gonna be three people livin' here, we're gonna start over with a different lease and I don't think I'm gonna lease it to you. - I'll call Tommy. Hey, uh, Tommy, it's Eric. Can you give me a call back when you get this, please? Just a minor emergency. Why isn't he answering the phone. Shit. I'm so sorry, I'm running in right now. (patrons chattering) - You have something against me? My tables get bused too, table nine. - I just set table nine. - [Crawford] That's table six, moron. This is table nine. (tense music) (Heather gasps) (engine revs) (door creaking) - Excuse me. - I'll get it. - You don't want him anywhere near your ass. - [Mickey] Not funny, Crawford, leave him alone. - Thank you. - I'm not on your side either. - All right, Mickey, I'm outta here. - Hey, what about my tip money? What is this? You're supposed to give me 15%. - You're supposed to set my tables. - Tipping is voluntary. (door creaking) I recounted it, it's all there. - Didn't need to be recounted. - I'm just sayin', you did it correctly. - I'll be right back. Eric, wait for me. - Honey, you're home. - Hey. - Hey, wait till ya see what I taught him. He barks at the door when he wants to go outside. - Oh, you taught him that? - Yeah, you wanna go for a walk. - Yeah, I just need you to run a really quick errand with me. - Hey, Tommy called me asking about you. Were you supposed to wait for him after work? - Yeah, I forgot, come on. - [Benny] Don't fuck with me, Dolores! Hey, I know when that punk's been here. There's somethin' goin' on. - [Dolores] I'm not lying to you, it's them. - What are we doing here? - It's not me. You're paranoid. You always believe what - Just need to talk to someone. - everybody else tells you. - I know it! - There is nothing going on. You don't know what you're talking about. - [Benny] I know exactly what I'm talking about. - No, you don't. - Dolores? Hello? - [Dolores] Yeah? - It's Eric, you busy? - What's up? - Hey, hey, my pal, Eric. Come on inside, we need to talk. - I can't stay, I'm just here to talk to Dolores. - Who's this, your bodyguard? - Dolores, I got something I need ya to look at. Can you come by? - Eric, let's go. - Yeah, do me a favor, would ya? Get lost. - No, Eric and I need to go home. - Is that right? Let me put it another way, get the fuck off my porch. - Shut up, Benny. - How 'bout if I shut you up? - She rode in the car with me. - Well, she's got two legs. - Come on, Eric. - Where you goin'? - [Dolores] Be back later. - Hey, where you goin'? Hey! - What was goin' on back there? I interrupted something. - Little trouble. - Who's in trouble? Am I in trouble? - How did you get out of prison so early, Eric? - I was scheduled to get parole and I got parole. - You got parole already and you didn't say anything to anybody? - No. - You know you'd be in as much trouble as the rest of us. - Trouble for what? - I wouldn't be in any trouble because I didn't end up doing anything. - Oh, so that's how we're gonna play this? You tell your own version and screw the other two? - That's not what I said. - Where'd you get the money for this place? - Friend. - [Dolores] Friend? - Just helpin' me out. - So, you're selling his furniture? - He gave it to me, I can do what I want with it. - This is hotel rental crap, I can't sell this. It's not worth haulin' outta here. - Oh, bullshit. Come on, give me a number. - I'll give ya 300 bucks. - For what, the couch? - [Dolores] All of it. - 300 bucks? - Is someone talkin' to you? - [Eric] Heather, just-- - Eric, you could get four times that much for this stuff. - From who? Why don't you buy it from him, honey? - I need 500, Dolores. - I'll give ya 350. - I need-- - Final offer. I'll be in the car. (Eric sighs) - [Tommy] Help ya out. - [Eric] Thanks. - Hey. You gonna be all cleaned up for me tonight? - Tommy, I don't feel well. My throat's really sore. - Hmm, okay, I know you're scared, but we're not gonna keep putting this off forever. - Yeah. (doorknob clicking) - I think someone's tryin' to get in. - [Tommy] Eric, what's this stuff in the lock? - Is that Tommy? I thought you said he wasn't coming over. - Shh. - [Tommy] Eric, I brought you some zinc tablets and vitamin C. (Tommy knocking) Eric, cut it out. Open the damn door. - Eric, look at me. - Why? - Right in my eyes. Are you sober? - Yes. - No drugs? - No drugs. - And you're not selling them either? - Not anymore, no. (Heather sighs) - Okay. - Okay, now you, right in my eyes. You promise to stay by my side no mater what? - Yes. - Even if people are tellin' lies about me, you promise to believe me and not them, right? - Yeah. - Okay, most important, what if I told you that I needed you to give me the best kiss that you've ever given anyone? (sullen music) - [Heather] Who's lying about you? - Shh, no talk, kisses only. (Eric howls) (Merlin barking) - [Heather] Stop! - Merlin, no. (Merlin barking) Merlin! (Eric sighs) Really need to get that pet deposit. - You just moved that furniture in. - So? - What are you doin' with it? - What's it look like? - Isn't it rented? - No. - Is it? - No. - [Landlord] Now, what are you doing? - You are just full of questions, aren't you? - You changin' the lock? - It's my apartment. - [Landlord] It's my building, I'll need a new key. - I'll have one made. - Lock sets come with two keys. - They didn't give me an extra. - Look there, two keys. - What would you even need to be in here for anyway? - [Landlord] I need an emergency key, it's the law. - Well, the extra's gonna be for Tommy. - I'll have one made for Tommy. - No, I'll do it, and I don't want Tommy in here when I'm not around. - His name is on the lease, he can come in here if he wants to. And what about the pet deposit? - I have 350 of it, you want it? - No, we're not doing this in installments. You either take the dog back where it belongs or I'm starting legal action. (patrons chattering) - [Crawford] What took you so long? - Mickey sent me for ice. - 25 minutes ago. Get the table, I got an order up. - Hey, hey, not without a bus tub. Hey, hey, get the ice first, okay? Never mind, I'll get the ice. There's a bus tub behind the register, get it. (door creaking) - Tonight, Eric, all right? - Yeah. - I really need ya to be there. - Heather? Heather! - [Heather] Merlin! Merlin, hey. - For a second, I thought you left. - When's the last time that Merlin ate? - Come with me, I got - Merlin. - the pet deposit, and I can get the furniture back now. - [Heather] Really? That's awesome. Merlin! Merlin, baby. Aw, Merlin, it's okay, Merlin, he got the pet deposit. You can stay here with us. - Tommy will see the furniture's gone. We need to go right now. - I can't go back there. - But you'll still be here when I get back, right? - I told you, I'm staying. - I gave you the money back, now tell me where the furniture is. - Forget the furniture, we're leaving. Take this. - [Eric] Benny would've called you if he got arrested. - Not if he thinks I'm the one who got him arrested. - What's the longest he's been gone for? - Eric, he's gone. We'll stay with my cousin in San Diego. - I'm not going anywhere. - My cousin's husband is sober, we can go to meetings with him. I'll get sober too, you can be my sponsor. - I'm not even three weeks sober, I can't be your sponsor. - I don't want some stranger. - Look, I'll catch up to you and we'll talk about it then. Just tell me your cousin's address. - You can't stay here. Either Benny's friends are coming for us, or the police are coming for us. Or are the police just coming for me? - They're not coming for me because I didn't do anything. - You already talked to 'em. That's how you got outta prison so early. Did you tell them I did it? - [Eric] No. - Did you tell them Benny did it? - Benny hit him with the shovel, but he was still moving when I ran away back to the car. I don't know what he did after that. - Did you say I was back at the car? - [Eric] I don't remember. - Benny was gonna kill you too, you know that right? Ya, I told him too many people knew you were with us. I saved your life. - [Eric] I just want the furniture back. - Okay. If they ask you again, I was with you back at the car. Benny was still with the guy, right? - Yes. - That's how we're gonna play this, right? - Please. - If he gets out, he's gonna kill your little girlfriend too if she's with you. - He's not getting out, they promised me that. - [Dolores] Furniture's in a storage unit. - What if Heather and I have to disappear later? Can you call her cousin and tell him we're on our way? (tense music) - Where you two goin'? - I thought you got arrested. - Why would I get arrested, Dolores? - I don't know, you disappeared. - You know what? I did get arrested. Funny it should occur to you. Oh, but they let me out for good behavior, just like Eric. - Did you say something to them? What did you tell them? - What did you tell them? - I have to go. - You, you down at Burlington Street the other night? - No. - Huh? Felix says there was a guy down there, an awful lot like you and he was sellin'. - Wasn't me. - Listen, if that guy that looks a lot like you shows up again down there, they're gonna be moppin' his guts up off the sidewalk. - [Eric] I said it wasn't me. - Come on Eric, tell me. How'd you get an early parole? - Eric's got a friend waiting outside. - Dolores, wanna come with me? - No, Dolores and I, we need to have a talk. - Hey Heather, it's Eric. Just don't go back by the apartment, okay? That Benny guy got arrested, and he thinks I have something to do with it. We'll talk later, just let me know you got this, okay? Fuck! (ominous music) - Where'd you get this? - Told you I was gonna talk to Tommy. - You didn't get this from Tommy. - Yeah I did. - Well, it's very strange, 'cause your dog's gone, and Tommy's back at your apartment throwin' a fit. - Where's the furniture, Eric? - It got stolen. - [Tommy] You sold it! - It got stolen! - Did you call the police and tell 'em that it was stolen? - Look can we handle this later okay? I need to sit-- - No! That furniture was rented, Eric. I have to pay for it. - It was cheap shit motel stuff. - I'm not paying for an apartment full of rented furniture that you sold for drugs! - It got stolen! - And I know Heather's been living here too. - She stayed here one night when her father hit her. - Can you go five seconds without telling a lie! - I need to go to bed. - No, you need to get out. You need to pack your shit and get out! - By when? - By now! - Oh Tommy, would you cut it out. Where's my dog? - Took him back to your mother's. On top of everything else, the dog you snuck in shit everywhere! - Fine, I'm going! - Where you gonna go? - What do you care? - Well, when I call the police about the robbery and they come up with a suspect, they're gonna need to know where to find you. - Tommy, I'm on parole. - Where's the furniture, Eric. - The people I used to sell drugs for stole it. - Fine, where do they live? We'll tell the police right where to find them. - You don't wanna fuck with these people, Tommy. - I'm not worried Eric, since they only exist in your imagination. - Tommy, please. Please. Please. - Take off your clothes. - What? - Take your clothes off. - Stop it. - [Tommy] Take them off. - No. - Come on. - [Eric] You come on. - Fine, I'll just call from home. - Tommy, I'm on parole. Well then, you better work out whether you're going back to prison or not. - We need to go get some condoms. - I'm negative. - What would you need a? No, no please Tommy, no please. I don't wanna do that, please. - I've been where you are, Eric. It's hard taking that first step, but we're gonna do this. This is the best thing for you. - I need to use the restroom. (tense music) (Tommy sighs) (clicking) (metal clanging) No, Benny, no! - (sighs) I can't believe this is finally happening. Come with me. You're still so beautiful. More a man now, but still so beautiful. Does that feel good, Eric? Answer me Eric, does that feel good? - [Eric] Yes. - [Tommy] I know it does. Take off your underwear. - Can you please just slow this down just a little bit? - Take them off. That was beautiful. Everything's gonna open up for you now. We're both gonna do great things. - See you tomorrow, okay? - Why you rushing me out? The snuggling's the best part. (door creaking) - [Heather] Hello? - [Tommy] Who's that? - [Heather] Eric, is someone in there with you? - Didn't you get my message? I told you not to come back here. - Really, you told her that? - Just shut up, please. - [Heather] Is that Benny guy here? Are you all right? - If she's not living here, why does she have a key? - [Heather] Eric, please. Is everything okay? Who's in there with you? - Please let me get dressed. I'll explain everything, I swear. - He's in love with me, that's everything. - Heather! - If you're leaving, don't come back! - [Eric] I won't. (door slams) Heather! Heather, are you here? - [Bert] She dump you already? - Where is she? - She's gone. - Isn't that here stuff? - She musta been in a hurry. (glass clattering) - [Eric] Merlin. Merlin! (tense music) (Eric sobbing) - [Marcella] Told ya not to untangle that. - [Eric] I didn't! - [Marcella] Didn't do it by itself. - You're gonna feel completely different about this in the morning. - [Tommy] I pushed it. I shouldn't have pushed it. I should have let him come to me. - Tommy, that's not why it didn't work. - He loved me. I'm all puffy and look like shit. He still loved me. Do you know how hard it is to find someone like that? - I still love you. - [Tommy] Quit it. (Mickey sighs) - Hey. (sullen music) Yes, I do, in spite of everything. We can make this work again. - No. I want a fresh start with someone, someone who's not gonna hate me for all the stuff that I've done. - I can be that someone. It would be a lotta work for the both of us, but I could be that someone. (loud banging) - Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! - [Tommy] Eric, what do you want? - You killed my dog! - No, I didn't. - [Eric] I want you to see what you did. - You're drunk, get out of here. - [Eric] You killed my dog! - [Tommy] I didn't touch your dog. I took him back to you mum's. - Did you untangle the chain? - He looked like he was choking. I felt sorry for him. - [Mickey] The police are on the line. - Will ya hang up? I can handle this. - Open it! - [Tommy] Forget the bolts. - Yes, we have someone tryin' to break into our house. - Will you hang up? I can handle this! (tense music) Will you just let me open the door? (gun bangs) - [Mickey] Tommy. Tommy! (door creaking) - It's okay. - It's not okay, I need your car. - What for? Okay, okay, I'll drive you. Hey, so you drank. You managed to get 18 days sober, and you'll do it again. We all only have one day really. Just one day at a time, right? - Stop talking. - Let's not go to Dolores'. Let's go home. Did you take Merlin out? Did he do that trick where he barks at the door? - Stop talking. - Something bad has happened. What do I not know? - Just drive. Please. (Heather sniffs) (static buzzing) (muffled speaking on radio) What happened? - [Woman] Found that lady dead. (muffled speaking on radio) - Eric. (tense music) Eric, what are you doing? - Get away, it's over. He'll kill us both. (sullen music) - Come home. Whatever you're doing, let's not do it. Let's go home. You and me and Merlin, right? You and me and Merlin, just like a little family. (hand slaps) - [Eric] I said, get away from me. (tense music) (phone beeps) (phone ringing) - Get the shovel. You, out! Let's go! - No, no, Benny, no. No, no! - Let's go! (Benny panting) Finish him. (gun banging) (men laughing) - [Heather] No! Get away from him! Get off of him! Get off, no, no! (solemn music) - [Man In Black Shirt] Is this stuff yours? - [Heather] No. - [Man In Black Shirt] He said we could take it. - Then I guess you can. - I saved these for you. You don't want 'em? Where you goin'? - School. - You're just gonna abandon me. - I'll die if I stay here, Daddy. - Just gonna let me die? - I don't know. I don't know what'll happen to you. (somber music) (sullen music)
