Like that star evening. I wait. I'm waiting for you. When the sunset .... Take a look. Look, the flowers are flowing. Look, they pierce dew with themselves. Love love. Love love. Do not leave me. Do not leave. Do not leave. Do not leave. I'm waiting, I'm waiting When there are flowers in the garden .. When the patrol is darker halfway. And the wind .. Goals ... And the stars are like ... My love ... love, love ... Do not leave me. Do not leave, do not leave. From the wife? No, from the daughter. The wife does not like to write. This is for you. Thank. Good afternoon. Hello. Good afternoon, señora. Gustow Larson. Professor of Anthropology. Marina Gromova. What brings you to our land? Moscow sent here too. To show us all how beautiful. Russian woman. Not sick of you, Morris? Rosita, a cup of coffee. By the way, please notice, professor. What are we French. Of all the women in the world, we prefer Russians. Oh. Romain Laurent, Leger and Loir. Their wives were Russian. Repeat yourself. Yes? Thank. I am a geologist. Expedition geologist working in Raa Gorge. And Maurice Barrot. Our adviser. On economic issues. And imagine? I have to listen to his awkward compliments for three months. Rosita, a cup of coffee, please. Good afternoon. And this, our chief engineer, Antoine Kurmaev. Anton, Morris. Anton. Larson. Very nice. Yes, yes, they told me. About the construction of a power plant in Raah. Well, it's too early to talk about construction. While we are conducting preliminary ... Works. Will you have some coffee, Antoine? Mandatory. Rosita? Seniors, have you ever watched? In those places where you .. Work. Relic Gemenoia. Whom? Well, let's say. Bigfoot. Snowman. Thank. And you laugh in vain. Locals claim. What they saw a bigfoot. By the way, in your Caucasus. Also found his tracks. Professor, I generally do a little photography. And I take it, without much difficulty. To make such evidence. And do you hope? Find ... this .. Bigfoot. For this, I came here. Hmm .. well, I confess I .. I have little faith in its existence. Excuse me. Bermuda Triangle. Snowman. These are all twentieth-century tales. Rosita, ready. “I do not believe” is not yet proof of the truth. I wish you success, seniors. Bye. Suspicious type, I tell you. Bigfoot ... some nonsense. I think it's just an eccentric. Well, you never know eccentrics in the world. And without them, by the way, it would be very boring in the world. It's right. Oh, what a smell! This is not a myth. This is really a reality. Thank. Only for you. Fantastic reality. Oh ... I believe in pael. Well, we still managed. Ohh, they came. The smell. Paelia. Yes seniors, I must disappoint you. Now we have nothing. Not get it. Vladislav, I have repeatedly told you. What if you follow. A strict diet. It will help you become. Slim and graceful. Like me. But then I will help you save. Your figure. Well?! There are many! Heroin. Come on to the shore. On a yacht! Stop the movement! Turn on the distinctive lights! On a yacht! Turn on the distinctive lights! Who is the boss? Mr. Devivier. Where is he? At home. Master! What's the matter? What happened? Who am I honored with? Centeviano Commissioner of the Criminal Police. Inspect. Me, Leon Tevye. French citizen. A businessman from Marseille. Take a boat trip on my own yacht. And my detention is illegal. I demand. Meetings with the consul. We will contact the consul. Tell me. Why did you anchor in the middle of the night? I can explain. When the shooting rose, I ordered. Captain go to sea, away from the coast. What's so strange here? And why on your yacht. There were no distinctive lights. May I find out what I suspect? You are suspected. In drug smuggling. And what ... Is it found on a yacht? Anything that confirms this? No, on your yacht. Nothing suspicious was found. Then I do not understand what claims to me. This is only part of the drug. Which was meant for you. Enter. I will complain. What do you say, Centeviano? If he is associated with a gang. Now grab it will not succeed. Maximum. Penalty for violation of navigation rules. Nothing more is behind him. And yet, take care of this type. Check through Interpol. I do not like his face. I know many who don’t like it. Well, let's say my physiognomy. Nothing follows from this. Come on in. We left. Where are the keys? Where from? Roy. Faster. Police. The wheels are broken. By cars. What happened? Nothing special. Just our friends. They wanted to give you freedom. And waiting for it to be done. By legal means. Rosita has arrived. Salute, Rosita. Senora Rosita! Oh shit. Good afternoon. What brought. Products Mail. Thank. Shall we take Yes. Come on. Come on. Op..i .. Vladislav, and you do it pretty well! When I studied in Bratislava, I worked part time. But a freight station loader. And in vain left this profession. Oh, now I understand. Where did you get such power from? Is it really silisha. For example, I have a father. To the argument. Bull raised. How do you manage alone. With the hotel, Senor Rosita. And what to deal with? Earlier, when the husband was alive. Then really just keep up, people abyss in the mine. It worked. And they came from the city. The rooms were not enough, the restaurant ... Buzzed all night. And when the left came. Of course .. The hosts abroad were fleeing. The mine is dead. There are a lot of things .. Closed. The people fled. I wanted to sell the hotel. And who will buy it now? He is us with Miki. Barely feeds. Yes, your times are not easy now. But your land is rich. Copper. They will build a power plant, there will be energy. Everything will be different. People will come. And your hotel will come to life again. Everything that was unloaded. Let's go now. God grant. You are careful here. We have bad places. Have you seen crosses near the hotel? Saw. My husband is there. Sergeo. My sister, behold, his mother. Last year. Bandits at the hotel. The shootout was arranged. Only I didn’t tell you that. Agreed, Senora Rosita. Garcia Marquez. One hundred years of solitude. Do you read French? What is surprising here? Oh yes, you are a subject. French republic. Native, if not mistaken, Marcel. Maybe finish this game? A game? What do you have in mind? And the fact that you are such Devyuvye, as I am the king of Morocco. I do not want to talk to you. In that tone. Why didn’t you give me? A date with the consul. AND? I think this is arbitrary. Sir .. Duvivier. Agree that after an armed attempt to free you. We have every reason. To doubt that. That you really are Mr. Devivier. These idiots. They took me for another. Well, how can you not understand this? But in the car waiting for you. There was someone. Sebastian Valdez, the head of the drug gang. Do you know Sebastian Valdez? I have no idea. It happens, of course. What are close relatives. They do not know each other. But this is not the case. Mr. Antonio Valdez. What? Am I Antonio Valdez? Who is he? Head of an underground drug trade syndicate. Ohhh, that's interesting. Come on, come on. Warm brotherly meeting. Antonio Sebastian Valdez. Paraguay. May twenty-fourth. Eighty-first year. And this is already. Business meeting. Carlo Gagliani. Drug dealer. Hong Kong. June nineteenth, eighty-second year. What accuracy, huh? Nonsense. How many similar people in the world. But two identical fingerprints. Can not be. Interpol Card. Enough? Since you are a citizen of our country. That is under the new law. Waiting for you, well, of course .. Not a hundred years of solitude. And about twenty, twenty five. Here you are. Everything is clear here. Of the two options for hydraulic structures. I prefer the first one. By the way, it was developed by the Americans. And these guys. They know how to count. Marie You are the most beautiful woman. Of all that I met. Like any pretty woman, you don’t know how to count money. You can only spend them. Morris. Perhaps, we can agree with this aphorism. Yes, the Frenchman is right. Of course, this option is more economical. But inevitably, flooding of the blue plateau is inevitable with its unique relict vegetation. Red Listed. And the ancient religious buildings, too, will go under water. There is something to ponder. But this is not an argument either. Temple, by the way. Can be rescheduled. Right here. And the extinction of some plant species. This is an inevitable process. It did not begin today, and it will not end on us. Too bad if these are beautiful places. Will go under water. There is a belief that the spirits of our ancestors dwell there. Legend. But my father never. Not hunted in these places. And quite a legend. Archaeologist Sanchez claims. That there are ancient burial places. Stop, stop, stop. Are perfumes also listed in the Red Book? Well what are you saying? Refusal of the first option. It will increase the cost of construction. And this is very important for your country. About fifteen years ago. One sick old woman. Gathering grass on a blue plateau. Appeared. Holy Madonna. Healed her. Turning into beautiful. Young lord. And do you believe that? And you, Morris? Oh yes, I am a believer. But this is nonsense. I don’t believe either. But the blue plateau. It turned into a place of pilgrimage for those .. Who believes in it. And there are many of them. True, they appeared in newspapers. Articles which say that the government. Taunts .. The religious feelings of the people. And what, should we also consider this? I'm afraid so. And unfortunately. I am about these circumstances. I didn’t know before. This country is not rich enough to pay. Superstition of their fellow citizens. There are many enemies in the country. And they will take advantage of this to .. Compromise the construction. Waterworks. Yes, and the government itself. But this is already politics. But politics does not concern us. Well, there are situations when .. Economic calculations. Must give way to political. In a country where religion is so strong. It is impossible not to reckon. With the mood of people. The explosion at the central radio station. And recent bombings. In residential areas of the capital. The police department is believed to have been produced. By the terrorist group. Closely associated with the Right Alliance. The terrorists managed to escape. The explosion killed seventeen people. Twenty-eight seriously injured. Police are investigating. This sight is not for my nerves. Obviously, this is familiar to you. And yet. Our task is to create. The atmosphere in the country. Fear. And uncertainty. Only in this way will we be able to return to power again. I had it yesterday. Conversation with our American friend. Americans are extremely concerned about the plans. Nationalization of banks. And key industries. They support our course. To destabilize the left regime. And they are ready to give us all kinds of help. Refusal to provide current. Government loans. I ask you to. Already says a lot. A cigar? No. Thank you So here. You, of course, know. What's in the Raah Gorges. The expedition is working. Just today, I read an interview in the newspaper with its leader. You pay attention. The expedition is international. And headed by her. Famous Russian engineer. So there are good reasons. Suppose. What a contract for the construction of Raah. GES government will conclude. With the Russians. And in due time. The construction was supposed to be entrusted to the Americans. That's right. And our friends. Interested to have this contract. With the Russians did not take place. Do you understand me? But the expedition works. Flown by the UN Development Program. And what actually bothers you? International resonance? All the better. Any complications that may happen to expedition members. Undermine trust. To the government? On the part of international public opinion. Do you understand? What our organization cannot take. To take the responsibility. For a similar share. After all, in the event of coming to power. Right Alliance. You are absolutely right, my friend. This business should be. Conducted as follows. To the Alliance remained unsullied. My parents live in the Tatra Mountains. They have a house in Nikulasi. They wanted a daughter to be born. And only sons were born. I'm their seventh. I am sure they are you. Would be accepted as a native. How dear? You ride, we’ll catch you. That is what I wanted to tell you. We often see each other at conferences. The second year we work together. And it always seemed to me. You speak, speak, I listen to you. Something I’m not saying it right .. Yes .. I'm certainly not handsome. Yes, now I'm balding. Thirty years already bald. Actually, that person. Positive. Vladislav? In my opinion, you make me an offer. No. Just ... I thought ... Your brother acted rather primitively. What do you mean? If he captured some significant face. Or a group of persons, and demanded from the government. In exchange for your release. Plus reimbursement of the cost of seized drugs. I suppose you would be free already. Nice thought. It’s a pity that it didn’t occur to my brother. Not too late. You can tell. And who will tell him? M Aren't you? Mr. Commissioner. I can too. You? Yes. But for this I have to meet. With Sebastian. And you must help me with this. Smartly. You want me to give you my brother with my own hands. I understand you have .. All reasons not to trust me. But if I am interested in your release? Why would it? I need money, Valdez. I suppose this amount. Worth your freedom. Why should I believe you? You may not believe it, but this is your only chance. Well? Good. Take a chance. Do you know Copper Angel Hotel? Yeah. Find the hostess of the hotel. Ask her to mix. You and Sebastian. Will she believe me? Show it here. Payment? Get the first half. Tomorrow. From my lawyer. The second, after release. Gentlemen, please attention! While we are engaged, I am not afraid of the word. Peaceful labor. Our Slovak hero. Vladislav, storms the impregnable fortress. How are you doing, Vladislav? So. Calmly, I was joking, I was joking. No no. Well, wait a moment. No, don’t. Well, you don’t understand jokes, or what? Well ... well, don't. Well, what kind of jokes? Well, re .. Very funny. Highly. Chuckle. I don't like your jokes. Consider next time. I'll throw you over there on that rock. Vladislav, we still need Morris. Gentlemen, but you can understand him too. Who can remain indifferent looking at our Marie. Marie, but I want to warn you. Do not get carried away with this type. One hundred horsepower. No, don’t get carried away. What did I tell you? Marie, you are made for the best. And Vladislav is really not indifferent to you. Leave this to Morris. Excuse me. Marina, how is the trip? Where you propose moving the target. Significant landslides are possible. Well, if that happens. Then even if the dam survives. Overflow wave will flood fertile lands. Well, the possibility of landslides. So far, your assumptions. You did not conduct deep intelligence there. Have to call geophysicists. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, señora. How are you? Thank. Who is the mistress here? I am the mistress. I need Sebastian Valdez. I do not know Valdes. Good afternoon. Hello. Yeah. Sebastian. Valdez. Ernesto! Ernesto! Well? Take the lord. To my. Uncle. Sebastian? They came to you. Who! I do not know. Hm, good afternoon. Who you are? What do you need? The attack on the prison machine made your brother's situation harder. Antonio needs help. So what should I do? Attack the prison? What for? There is an easier way. Which one? Well... Well, get out of here. Quickly! So what is the way? Capture a group of faces. Having for the government. Special interest. And demand in exchange the release of Antonio. Plus damages. Drug you inflicted. Which ones? One expedition works in Raah Gorge. So .. Who needs them. Could it be better than some minister? M Minister of Government. Can donate. And here is the relationship. With the United Nations. He won’t want to complicate it. Politics. No, this is not for me. This is an order from Antonio. And who are you actually, huh? Enough that your brother knows. Good. I'll try. Ernesto. Yes. Come down to the camp and see what happens there. Good. But fast. Why did you send the guy? And if you get caught? They didn’t ask you. He is Valdes. Let it get used. ..do not leave me.. Do not leave .. Let the words .. Burn tongue and lips. I should. Tell them to you. Love .. Do not leave me. Don’t leave .. Martel? For what reason? The business is that I was going to drink this bottle. On the day you finish work. Yeah. But thanks to your efforts. Our expedition is delayed indefinitely. So I think the most appropriate day. Exactly today. You think so? I am convinced of this. Up! Chihagbilly. Made according to my recipe. Moscow friend Rivadze Kiladze. True, instead of hops had to put curry. Instead of chicken ... A parrot? Do not offend the mountain partridge. But for what reason? I beg. Attention! Attention! Looks like ... Yes. What happened? Today is the thirteenth? Yes. Congratulations. Congratulations! Happy Birthday! Wow. I forgot. Three guards. So. Five workers. Well. And five of these, their expeditions. Where is this from? Lay. Yes? Parenting. Stay here. Warn everyone. Do not shoot. Let's go. Do not shoot. Start the live broadcast. From the Paris Olympia Hall. At the request of the newborn. Our guest is Boris Baro. Serheo? I'm sorry, seniors. We seem to have interrupted your fun. Hello. Who are you and what do you want? Well, we'll meet later. Now I want to. So you go. Together with us. I am the leader of the expedition. We work in your country. From the UN Development Program. And I demand that you immediately. From here ... And I demand that you immediately go to the cars. We won’t go anywhere. Stop! Where to go? To the cars. You need to run. How? At the bottom of the horse, jump along the river. Cars will not pass there. I need to change clothes. Max, follow. Go. Well, what are you messing with there? Run away! Catch up. You bastard. Don't approach. Don't approach. Drop the gun. I ordered not to shoot. Will you find a girl for me? Me and you ... I’ll take off my head if you don’t find it. Max! AND! Interestingly, Marina managed to get to the hotel? Let's hope. Looks like some .. Powder warehouse. Good morning seniors. Yes .. Sorry. But the situation you have here. Not the most comfortable. What do you want from us? From you. Nothing from you. We will set you all free. As soon as the authorities fulfill all our conditions. What kind? One person will be released from prison. They will return our goods to us. Or.. Reimburse the losses incurred. Drugs. It does not matter to you. Do you trade drugs? However, do not disdain murders. Do not preach to me. Better yet, write to your manual so that it requires from the government to speedily fulfill our conditions. I beg. We will not write anything. Think about it. Think about it. But the sooner the better. If, of course, you want your sweet company to stay alive. I do not understand. Should the government not agree to their terms? Will they shoot us? You can not doubt it. I'm afraid this is the case. Yes..well .. Q ... after all, we are not random people. We are in this country at the invitation of the government. And they must .. Yes, they simply have to go for an exchange. Yes, but we don’t know who exactly the bandits want to exchange us for. And whether the government will agree to their terms. Today we are, tomorrow different. Someday you need to end this blackmail. Wow, yeah. But ... but only after we are exchanged. I do not want. I do not want to be killed! Well ... my mom won't survive this. The Frenchman is right. But what if you try to run? To run? But how do you imagine this "run" ?! Yes, they just shoot us to hell, and that’s it. Don’t tell, Maurice. They still need us. They will protect us. As long as there is. At least some chance of an exchange. Yes? They killed Jose Cadrero. Mr. Johansen. The others were taken away. I don’t know where. Stay at the hotel. Do not go anywhere. They will come for you. Do you hear Madame Gromova? I hear. I saw them here at the hotel that day. When we met. Calm down, Marina. Follow me. Quickly. Drink it. Thank. We wait two days. If after this period our conditions do not will be executed, the hostages will be destroyed. Where is the expedition woman? I did not see. Whose horse is this? This is my ass. Search. No. Well! Come out, beauty. Who shot? Just think about it. I forgot that it is charged. Run through .. Balcony. There's a ladder. Wait. Well. BUT. Professor. Yes, you hit like frogs. How did you get into this company? What is a company? No worse than the other. I’ve been a year before. He worked at the mine. And how the mine was covered. Where to go? And here it is money. You understand that. Here ... The capitalist is under a gathering. And give up. Or to the States. Or to Europe. I’ll open the bar. I think you will burn it, man. With your own bar. Why? Yes, because customers. I won’t get a beer. Your tongue is too long. Release. Excuse me. Open it. Hold on. That's it, like a frog in a dough. Calmly. Faster. Did not work out. Uh, bastard. I'll burn you ... What? I passed everything. And the woman from the expedition? I tried to run. Well, I asked you not to shoot. I aimed at the horse. He aimed at the horse. It would be better if you aimed at your filthy head. Cretin. Check ignition. What am I checking? Ignition. Professor? Lord, how worried I am. Wanted to search, but where? Are they at the hotel? No. Until they appeared. What to do? I have nowhere to go. Yes, no one should see you here. Even Rosita? Rosita is a good person. But the fear of bandits is stronger than her. Go quickly through the kitchen. No one is there right now. Come up to me. And I, in which case, distract them. The government agreed to the terms .. Valdes and they will receive. And they will get their boss and another two million dollars. It seems to me that the government was a little hurried. With your decision. One could try. To beat them off by force. Do you know where they are? And then.. This expedition is international, and .. We have no right. Risk the lives of its members. How could such a thought have come to this Sebastian? You will have to meet him. And agree. About the time and place of exchange. Meeting at the hotel "Copper Angel". Tomorrow. At nine. Yes, and one more thing .. In a hotel. A woman is hiding from an expedition. It is urgent to take out from there. Go eat! Where are you staggering? I know where the expedition is. This does not concern us. Doesn't concern? No. They want to build a power station. People come back here again. Well, don't you want that? I don’t want another cross to appear on the hill, hear, I don’t want to! Listen, Rosita. Sebastian holds them in the mine. In the warehouse, where the explosives were stored. The guys and I climbed there, behind the fuses. And told you not to meddle in this matter? I told you? Do not want, then I myself. One. Where?! Wait .. Wait, I said. Sit down. Well, eat it. Eat, I told someone! Do you want to help people? I do not want. Okay. Where are you going?! Come on. I'll lock you up. I'll lock you up so you don’t do anything stupid. Such a bastard. You’ll sit until I let it out. Sit here! Bastard. What? You’ll go to a meeting without me. Ah, he was scared. I need to take the guy. I'll be waiting for you at the pass. Why the hell should I do such a hook? I said! All. Go. Where did she go? This woman is from the expedition. How do I know? She mounted her horse, and rode off. Who is waiting for us? Here. Commissioner of the Criminal Police Senteviana. Where are we going to talk? So tomorrow at twelve in the afternoon. On Bridge. You will arrive from the city. We are on this side. At the slightest attempt to break. Conditions, the expedition will be destroyed. Money in american dollars. All. We have agreed to? Not really. Ask yours. Bodyguards move away from the door. Get out. What do you think, Vakeras? What will the Valdos do to you? When they find out. That you secretly sold one of the lots of heroin to Galliano. They put money in their pocket. And they depicted things like that. As if you had to drop the load. Fleeing the police. Bluffing, commissar. Gagliano is arrested. During the search, we found your receipt from him. Here is a copy of it. It seems to me, seeing her. Sebastian will just shoot you. Hmm ... take it, take it. For memory. In general, you are not interested in releasing Valdos. He put this boy on your neck. Own brother. And before that, you were the boss. I know that. You think about that. What is the right time now. Get rid of Sebastian. You hell. If the exchange fails for some reason. Antonio Valdos will be stuck in prison for twenty years. And you are the complete master of the matter. So.. The exchange should not take place. There are people interested in this. Sooner or later they will come to power. And do not forget your service. The expedition should disappear. Forever. What do you think? I have no choice. And time too. I am authorized. Agree with you on the terms of exchange. The exchange should not take place. Sooner or later they will come to power. And do not forget your service. The expedition should disappear. Forever. What do you think? I have no choice. And time too. What to do? Will they be killed? Why are you silent? Because I don’t know where they are. Miki What are you doing here? Why are you eavesdropping? I know where the expedition is. Where? Sebastian hid them. At the mine. In the warehouse where it was stored. Explosives They can be saved. Run through an abandoned adit. To the old entrance. There may be blockages in the adit. And I have a rope, a lantern. Explosives Where did you get her? In stock. Well? Hungry? Here you will not. Poke your nose where you do not need. Oh, you bastard. Escaped. I'll show you! Get out! Mickey! Wait! Wait! Wait! Bastard! Bastard! Oh you.. Cattle. Hmm .. And my brother is my head. it’s necessary to come up with this. But come up with one thing. If not for me .. Take the old road. What for? And if Sentiviano put someone on our tail? What happened? Drunk like a pig. He threw me out of the car. They are kept here in this warehouse. Are you sure? Right See, you see a guard with a gun? His name is Max. So .. I need to check. Are they there. There’s a chimney on the roof. We talked with the guys. Through it when they stole explosives. And on the other side there is a staircase. No, no, I'll do it. They know my voice. Anton Petrovich! Vladislav? Maurice ?! Do you hear me?! It's me, Marina! We are here! Micah, what are you doing here? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Am I telling anyone? Can you not flicker? What? Well.. It would be necessary to collapse. Yes nowhere. Catch up with. You can’t fly far on this angel. I said it was necessary to leave. Through the adit. You were right. Anu-ka, all to the adit. I will catch you. Faster! This is Rosita’s car. What the hell is she here? Well, catch up with her. No one. Oh my God. Anton Petrovich. Everything is fine. Faster, follow me. Max! Max! Where is this blockhead? Where are they? Gone. Well, that’s what. You are to the old adit, and to the cable car. Alive! And you are in the adit. Vlad, do you think it is very deep here? It’s enough that you no longer ask such questions. This is not the best joke, so you climb. Max! AND?! What are you yelling? Faster. Faster. Well, what are you? Wet. Slippery. Well? Yes, the devil will break his leg there. Nobody's here. Faster! Faster! Vlad! Hurry up! Anton Petrovich! Hold on. Like this. Maurice, here. Wait! Wait. Wait. Are you crazy to get on wheels? Come on, wounded there. So they went to the sanatorium. Yes. It is very good. This is a safe place. What are you ?! Bastard! Scab ... Don’t go! In these matters! Well, still alive back! They will kill you ..! The hotel will get .. Enough with me three crosses! Rosita! Enough with me! Three ..! I do not want to live! Until the fourth cross! I do not want! Where are the people from the expedition ?! I dont know. Where? Well? Let it go Let me go! Ahh, puppy! Leave me alone! This guy was with them. Let it go. Where are the people from the expedition? I don’t know where they are. I do not know! Do not touch! I'll you .. I'll tell you everything. Be silent! They are in a children's sanatorium. Where?! You ... let ... Let go! What's going on here? Bastard! Yeah, thank you. What happened, Marquez? Why do you urgently need me? Coffee? Thank. I had no other choice. What I have to tell you. DO NOT entrust the phone. What are you talking about? The fact. What a capture expedition. Smugglers Valdos. The work of Commissioner Sentivieno. Yes, you are crazy. The first time Centivieno arrived at the hotel. On Thursday, in makeup. I didn’t even recognize him. At first. But drew attention to the number of the car. What were they talking about. With Sebastian, I don’t know. This morning he arrived again in the same car. But, already without any makeup. I didn’t send him on Thursday. And today he was carrying out my assignment. Only in part. Here, listen to the tape. Collusion with bandits. Incredible. Did he see you at the hotel? He does not know me. Here I am .. I noted with crosses. Places through which drugs are transported. That party about which I informed you. Transported to Valdos. Here. Lord In Moscow .. somehow I could not believe that this happens. Bandits, drugs. Hostage taking. You read in the newspaper, and you just can’t imagine. Thank. I got on the radio with the police. Fog in the mountains. As soon as it disperses, a helicopter will be sent for you. How is your leg? Thank you Doctor. You treated me. Like with a crystal vase. Well ... you couldn’t stand it. You fool me for two weeks. In order to pull me out. A lot of money. You think so in vain. Yes, there is only two hours of work. Scandal in vain. I AM... Sent ... out ... her .. Mechanics in the city for spare parts. This is a very rare model. A rare model ... Now they do not release such. I know your tricks. Rosita. Where is vakeras? Where is vakeras? I dont know. Where is vakeras? I dont know! Where is vakeras? Yes you. say he will kill you. He is crazy. Tell him. That they are in a children's sanatorium. Come out. Quickly! And you! Rude. And ignorant! You do not know how to talk with people. To Wall. Get out. Moron. Where are you going? This is my car! Wait! Who is in charge? What's the matter? Where is the expedition? Nobody's here. Search the premises. There are children. It does not matter. I will accompany you. They should not see these people. Hide them in a linen warehouse. You are arrested. Here is the warrant for your arrest. Well, this is some kind of misunderstanding. I’ll call the police department right now. Is not allowed. But can I at least get dressed? Get dressed. Sign up. Quiet. Weapons Weapons on the floor! Hands behind head. Go through. Go through. Door. Door! Close! Quiet. If you do not extradite these people. I will order. Sanatorium burn. And shoot you. There is nobody here, I have already said. But, even if they were. I give five minutes. What do we do? They will shoot them all. Need to go. We have no other choice. Yes. Let's go. Marina, and you will stay. I will go with you. Stay. Enough of three. I will go. Maurice? Huh? Thank you Doctor. And thank you all. Well. And what are you going to? To do, Centivieno? To run. To run. And you must help me with this. Make a passport. Baggage diplomatically. Well, hell, I don’t know. Send your plane. You can do everything. Understand staying here is suicide for me. Are you convinced that this is your Wakeres? Will do it like that. How did you agree to rent? No doubt. He has a wolf grip. He hates Valdos. So, this is your Vaqueros. Killed. Yes, yes, killed! And the exchange will take place, as agreed, tomorrow morning! But this is unreal. How do you know? Do you think that we have no other sources besides you? We will help you Centivieno. But, only after the matter is completed. They are looking for me. They are watching me. What can I do? And if during the exchange. Antonio Valdez will be killed. That hostages immediately destroyed. But who will do it? You .. me? You are Centivieno. But this is crazy. And only on these conditions we will help you hide. So.. Rosita! People from the expedition can be killed! There is a man with a rifle hiding behind a bridge! What kind of person? What are you talking about? Well, the one that came back then. To Vaqueros. Good afternoon, Mr. Kurmaev! Good afternoon! Good afternoon. Good news! Yes? This applies in part to you. Oh, interesting. Vladislav, Marina, Morris. Listen to this. Two months ago. We reported release.
