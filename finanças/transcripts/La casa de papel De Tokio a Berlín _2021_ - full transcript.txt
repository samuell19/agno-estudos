WARNING: THIS DOCUMENTARY CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE FIFTH SEASON A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY How do you bring something so huge to a close? I remember the last shot. When we said, "That's the one." They didn't want to get out of the helicopter. They stayed inside, taking photos, hugging each other. To think how far I've come, both as an actress and as a person, while being here, and… now, it's over. It brought together so many emotions over a long period of time, and… and I can still feel it. I'm gonna miss Darko, Jaime, Miguel, Esther, Itziar. It's sort of a life-changing experience. Such intense work, you know? Wait. Give me a minute. It's like a little light bulb goes on, and you think, "Shit, it's really over?" Yeah. What can you do? Oof. What a journey, right? What a journey. To see your colleagues there… right in front of you… Well, it's very moving. I think the effort that the Vancouver team made, as a whole, all the departments, was just… tremendous. It's been four seriously intense years. So many people who haven't stopped for a single second. I can only express gratitude for everything Money Heist has taught me. To be honest, I feel a great deal of sadness about finishing Money Heist. We could get all melodramatic, appeal to nostalgia, and talk about how sad we are to be finished with all this, but that would be so unfair. Because this season has been a celebration. Yeah! Yeah! Sure, it was the last one. But that's precisely why it was the most marvelous one. We celebrated until dawn. We danced. We sang. We went back to where it all began. We felt the pulse of life. We pretended we were on the Norwegian Sea, when it was really the Canary Islands. I don't want water! I want whiskey! We laughed. We had contests. It starts with an A. The word Hovik says to me every morning. - "Abnormal." - That's it! We practiced on canvases, and we laid down houses on top of gigantic treasures. So, welcome to our last heist. Experience it with us. They've had such a good time that it would be a shame for you to miss out on it. This is the last day. Then, it's all over. Well, we didn't all have such a great time. Some of us suffered. A lot. All sorts of things are happening to the Professor. The writers aren't letting me get the slightest break. I can't right now, Marseille. I can't right now. Yeah. First, I was tied up. I escaped. They tied me up again. I'd appreciate it if this rope were a little shorter. I think it's better here. All sorts of things are happening. There's more to come. There's an explanation for this. It's all part of a recipe. The more the Professor's plan goes off the rails, the more the tension escalates in the show. Look the kid in the eye! This is too much. Suddenly, the series breathes. We go outside the bank a lot. It's like… It's intense. It's frenetic. But at the same time, very concise. The Professor has to face a bunch of problems that come up. Things he hasn't planned for and that he has to solve on the go. What was that? It's here and now. It has to be done now. Listen, I have a registered letter for 5-C. Would you open the door so I can leave him the notice? Thank you. What you can't imagine are the rituals that Álvaro performs in order to become the Professor. I also have a weird side. My little quirks, my obsessions. And so, when I work on a character, I always… On the one hand, you use music. It gets me into character, and it's quite specific. Gillespie's "A Night in Tunisia." Because it sort of gets me into the groove that the Professor has going. That's right. And aside from that, I have my ritual around how each character I play dresses. First this, then that, and then that. Until I have my shoes on, I won't pull up my pants. Action! Then, I put my belt on. With my pants up but not fastened, I put on my shirt, I do up the buttons. I can't have my shirt on before putting on my pants. I'm sorry. Right after that comes the tie, which I leave undone. Then, I roll up my shirt sleeves, and after that, I make the knot on my tie, which has to be at the exact spot. I'll sometimes tie it seven or eight times until it's perfect. 'Cause the tip of the tie has to fall exactly halfway over the belt buckle. But if you want to imitate the Professor, you'll need to know a few tricks. The first one is obvious. The glasses, of course. He always puts them on with both hands… and adjusts them with one finger. Well, for me, the glasses are a bit like a mask on the Professor's disguise because he's always hiding behind them. In fact, when there were… There were moments in this fifth season that were very awkward for the Professor because he wasn't wearing his glasses. For him, it was very awkward to be in that situation. And my glasses? I need my glasses. The next trick you need to learn to be able to do a Professor impression is the hand gestures. The Professor doesn't point like this. He points like this because he's a convoluted guy. He's a guy who hides what's really inside. Why would they go through all that trouble? - Because they need to. - Exactly! And the final touch to play the Professor. His posture. In the past, he was a lot more hunched over, a lot more self-absorbed, with his shoulders sort of sagging, right? It's more as if he were constantly hiding from the world. And as it gets closer towards the end of everything, he starts standing a little more upright. His entrance at the bank is one of the moments when the Professor's standing more upright. Or at the end, when they're about to go in the helicopter. That's how weird the Professor is. That's how weird Álvaro Morte is when he performs his ritual to get into the character. Do you know who's the most important character this season? The gold. And the best thing about it? If we ignore the fact that the real police would be waiting outside, you could actually clear out the Bank of Spain's national reserves. All you'd have to do is follow our plan because it is possible. Yes. Yes, it really is. That's when the next stage begins, which enables us to move the gold… The main challenge in getting the gold out was… the method of extraction. First, you have to break down the bars, melt them. Once the gold is melted into grit, you have to get it out through the pipes, and then it's like, "Now what?" We're going to make the gold go upstream like salmon do. You would think that Palermo was the mastermind behind our heist, but in fact, the brains behind our plan is this man. My name is Luis Ramón Núñez. I have a doctorate in naval engineering. I was director of the school at Madrid's Polytechnic University. I've been involved as a researcher in harnessing the energy of sea currents. He was the one who added substance to our… Am I crazy? …intuition. I realized that oil rig pumps could move gravel from the seabed, and I said, "Well, if they can move gravel from the seabed, they can also move gold." That was all I needed to know. From that point on, someone else had to make it a reality. It extracts the aggregates from the seabed as if it were baby food. It's a great idea. I liked it right from the start. I thought, "Wow. How original." We only aspire to pure genius. I did a precise calculation for them, using the basic equations for fluid mechanics. Completely. He's crossed every T, every detail. You take the density of pure gold, then see what the volume of 90,000 kilos might be. There's no margin of error. Because they would use all the formulas I'd come up with on a blackboard. They'd explain them, and… It's all measured. All calculated in detail, Sergio. When I told Luis Ramón Núñez that we wanted to get it out in 26 minutes, he said, "No." Impossible. "Guys, you can't do that. Four hours." "They're telling me four hours is impossible, Mr. Núñez." "What about two hours?" "Let's see. Two hours? No." We recalculated. The best we could do was about 5,000 seconds. That's approximately an hour and a half. Ninety-one minutes and thirty-seven seconds later… He couldn't say "an hour and a half." It didn't sound right. - How so? - We have the vault right here, right? 120,000 liters of water. That will be our driving force. So then, we're going to use the following equations. The first one is the power of the pump. It's a technical marvel. 5,300 kilowatts of power. And we get a speed of 3.25 meters per second. That's relatively high. Sergio, we're gonna move the gold three and a quarter meters per second. - It's absurd. - There's one problem with that. - Now he's wondering, "What about..." - The loss of pressure due to friction? We'll calculate the laws due to friction using the Darcy formula. The Darcy-Weisbach equation. An 18th-century French dynamics engineer. We've got it to the millimeter. The only problem we might have... He's using too much pressure. It's optimistic, but it's a very high-quality pump, practically brand-new because they stole it from a Norwegian drilling operation. All this, after we do the math, gives us 5,300 kilowatts. Let's go! Faster! Come on! 4,500! Five thousand! Now! It's very clever because, of course, they're using an existing pipeline that is supposedly there. These are the pipes. This is the stormwater tank. Here is the river. And I mean, it's really well thought out because it's real. This is real. It can be done. What he proposes can be done. My dear friend, no one will expect. It could be done. But if there was no emotion underneath all of this… Goddammit! …it would be of no use to us. Science shall not live on numbers and calculations alone, Benjamín. Have a little faith, no? And a little love too. We always look at it from the perspective of being fully engaged emotionally with the characters. That's what gives us the DNA of Money Heist. It's not a series about heists. It's a series about heists with people who love each other. It's not just the gold. It's all the nights we spent planning it together. That moment, I think, is very touching. When the gold isn't coming out, and Palermo speaks to the pump, right? Beautiful memories of my life. I am begging you, for the love of God. Making these characters real, you know? With real emotions. That's how we make the viewers feel like they know them. Don't let this be a mistake. Don't let it be an illusion. I'm begging you, for God's sake. And the main thing is the romanticism behind this robbery. It's not so much about the gold itself, but about achieving the impossible. At the end of the day, our characters are romantics. - They want to achieve the impossible. - Come on! Come on! It's emotional because, deep down, there's a whole love story behind it. With Berlin. It was a catastrophe. It's a bit unwarranted, right? That a guy like Palermo might fall for a guy like Berlin, as played by me. It's a little far-fetched. Why do you say that? I remember they said, "Rodrigo de la Serna is coming." I thought, "No one is gonna believe his character is…" Ah, he's such a flatterer. Brother. I felt an instant connection with you, right? And I think it was… - It was sudden. - It was very sudden. - Like we immediately found each other. - Yes. You think I don't love you? I feel it too. There's something between us. Something extraordinary, unique, marvelous. Well, this happens to me when we work together, right? It's impossible to predict what will happen when they say, "Action." Some scenes, like the famous scene we did together, where we had to kiss. I don't remember what we did. Are you a coward? Huh? But we grabbed each other. We fought. There… There was violence. The scene was violent. I mean, I felt like I was insulted as a man because this guy was leaving, and he was laughing. And at that moment, I thought, "Oh man." "I am gonna kill you. Gonna rip your throat out with my teeth." I mean, it was more of a passion thing, if you will. But my brother's right. We have to part ways. He's far out on the edge. So broken by loss and heartache. And he was devastated by the fact that the only love he ever had wasn't reciprocated, and on top of that, he's now dead. Both your character and mine are kind of operatic, right? A little bit operatic. - You've got something… - Well, mine is more pathetic than yours. Well, you always say that. Well, it's a type of pathos, isn't it? Palermo embodies that but in a good way. My drama teacher once told me there are only three states. Just three. Which are tragedy, if a tragedy occurs, pathos, then ominous. Which, when you've overcome that instance, but you still recall the tragedy. Then there's comedy. When you can take that tragedy and start to… - But you have all of them. - We all do. We all do, but you have them all a lot. But it's just those three pure states. That's all. There is another. Stress. Fuck! Holy mother of Christ. Well, now the mess is in Madrid. Yeah, it's typical of Money Heist to make things harder. Totally. The other departments hate us, and for a reason. Every time we'd read an episode, I went right ahead to see how many new spaces would appear. Working on Money Heist means constant stress because you think, "I won't have enough time to make this new set." Everything is fine on paper. I mean, you can write a line that says, "The Ottoman army walks through the gates." And it's just a line, right? But then you go try to film that. Well, we actually shot it. One, go! What the viewer sees is absolutely real. We like physical effects. Almost everything you see, 95% of it is a real physical effect. If we are supposed to melt gold, the gold is actually melted. If it's supposed to rain through the hole in the ceiling, in the gala dining room, it actually rains. If we are supposed to flood the set, we actually flood it. We took the biggest, tallest space we had, added a few columns. But it's a stormwater tank, so what's missing? I couldn't believe it at first. The water was missing. For example, first, he said there had to be water up to the knees. "So we'll put water in, guys. It's tough, but let's fill it with water." This is a global show, so everything in abundance. "Guys, we're one of the leading series. The others have dragons. What've we got?" But I mean, what? Are we going to work in a boat every day? It became a problem when I went down and found ten centimeters of water. It was completely impossible to go in there if you weren't wearing a pair of rain boots up to here. Production said to me, "You're crazy. What is all this?" And when we began doing some tests, checking the lighting, of course, it was spectacular. Because it served as a mirror. Any lights I put up in the stormwater tank would be duplicated. All the columns would be duplicated. Everything would be duplicated. So it was big, but now it would look twice as big. In the end, what we saw on the screen, I had to admit he was right. It was infinitely better. Episode 506. Sixteen A and B. Third, Mark B. But the big challenge for production this season was finding an oil-drilling rig in Norway. And there's the platform. We couldn't find one, so we had to settle for one that was being repaired off of the Canary Islands. We had to pretend we were in the Norwegian Sea, though it was 91 degrees. Roll camera. It's hot, but I have to pretend I'm cold. Also, I have a terrible cold, but no one can tell. I thought they'd have a tougher time in the Canary Islands. They behaved very well. Want some hot water? Some tea? We're sweating in negative four degrees. They have to dress up in all these clothes. Very warm clothes. What you have here is Arctic melancholy. Anyone who doesn't need to be here, please leave. Let's clear the space. All covered up while it was so hot. The rest of the crew were in shorts and T-shirts. It's a Norwegian oil rig. And we're going to have to insert ice in the sea, replace the sea, and add ice, so it looks like Norway. We're actually in Tenerife, with the sun and the beach. Don't scare me, okay? That's our man, Santiago. He's an underwater rover. Well, I think that's where we learned how they formed the original gang, you know? The one before the heist at the Mint. Twenty years working, and now you want to be a thief. It's the first time I had a one-on-one with Berlin. I'm excited. I'm really excited, to be honest. You think this sea is for cowards, you piece of shit? You came here dressed in your mother's coat. We thought we were the only romantics left on this earth! But we found another one! It's like this. There is one way to define a character that I'd like you to know. A definition that is physical and has its own hallmark. - Yoo-hoo. - It's her. My name is Alicia Sierra. This is my hair. I'm an inspector for the National Police. Then I put on the wig and get some freckles and whatnot, and I'll turn into that creature, into whatever I have to be. I'm off to makeup. Sara! To play Alicia Sierra, I have to find a kind of madcap energy. I don't know what it means, but it means something. I wanna start getting banged up. Put stuff on me, please. Ta-da. See? We're doing the freckles. Sara figured out a way to make them that's just awesome. I always ask for more. - They say, "You can see them on camera." - Señor Marquina, say hi to the camera. This is one of the biggest battles. "More freckles!" And she says, "No!" I'm 50, so I always pull my hair back. It's either that or surgery. So what do I do? Pull my hair back. It's just an extreme maneuver to distract us. Very young, all extra-cool. I don't ask them to give me freckles or wigs. I'm constructing a character, and I know what kind of qualities she has based on what they've written. They told me she's supposed to be pregnant. Alicia's here, yes, not me. And I make up the whole thing. So I say, "Blue eyes. Her name is Alicia." And I know how to do it. The thing is, it's hard to play a bad person with brown eyes. Najwa is someone who likes to be very close to wardrobe. She likes to play. She likes to investigate. She likes trying on a lot of stuff, you know. A wig, or a hat, or a sword, or a scar on your face. It's all the same. Any extra thing that isn't natural to you. You really have to take it onboard. Otherwise, it'll stand out. Like when you see someone wearing a hat and think, "Shit. It looks awful on them." It looks awful because they're too self-conscious about the fact that they're wearing a hat. Hats suit people who forget they're wearing them. I swear on the baby Jesus. Her wardrobe went through a radical change this season. The way she arrives at the stormwater tank, dressed almost like Colombo. I mean, it's like she's hiding behind her glasses and so on. And it's really nice to see how she's transformed into the sexy woman that we see at the end. I don't know if I would've made her so sexy. I like the top part. I think it's okay. She's full-breasted after giving birth. I'm a woman who just had a baby girl, and I'm breastfeeding. In the final stretch, near the end, during the final farewell, they hit the nail on the head. The wardrobe was perfect from the outset because the cut was incredible with those military colors. It had everything. It was, like, the Sierra of the future. I loved it. You know what's really difficult for an actor? Playing a character who's always at full throttle. Jesus Christ. The challenge is to keep it all reined in. Ships, aircraft carriers, every goddamn fucking thing! He's a character with a strong military personality. Goddammit, I heard you. I'm trying to think here. He's full of energy. Quickly, my ass. Very exaggerated. You're givin' me a hard-on, Angelito. Such a filthy mouth. She beat us to it, that fucking bitch! That makes him very humorous. People have fun watching him. You just negotiate. When you have a lively character who experiences such powerfully tense moments, you have to define each one. Okay, then let's continue where we left off. Do you have it open? - I think we were… - On page 12. Oh, okay. Well then, let's get to it. The first thing I need is the script. That's what I start with. I do an in-depth analysis of the script. And I normally do that on my treadmill that I have at home because it's even been proven that our memory retains things much better while we're moving, and that helps me lighten the workload of study. Once in a while, my friend Esmeralda who lives next door lends me a hand. She's a neighbor who lives next door here, and she's… Well, she does me this huge favor because there's a huge difference between trying to memorize the script alone and interacting with someone else who's feeding the lines to you. Great. We've got this one down now. - That's okay? Page 31? - Yeah. "Consuelo?" I see she's not there. I press the panic button, and I go towards… the kitchen. "Tamayo, we weren't expecting you so soon." I really love your home. - "I'm enchanted by your home." - "What the fuck are you doing here?" What the fuck are you doing here? "Shh! No swearing." At this age, they're like little sponges. And I don't want you traumatizing her, so… "…good vibes. Smile." Okay. Now I look at the baby. I look at her. "If you hurt my wife…" I'll wipe you off the face of the earth. And from that point on, I try to find images that I think are evocative or that take me back to the moods that the character goes through in a particular episode. I try to create a series of gestures that have a lot to do with Tamayo. Also postures. All his gestures. His body language. That's all very important. Like, the moments when he's looking at the screens, for example. This gesture is very typical of Tamayo, isn't it? And there's all that stuff he does with his hands when things are going wrong. The way he touches his own face. I don't know. I work with my hands a lot. With my hands clasped, my fists… C'mon, c'mon! Music is one of the first things I always use. I try to find music that takes me back to the emotional state my character is in. I use some tracks by Marilyn Manson that are really punchy for those moments when the tension is really cranked up to 11. - All I want is a fair war. - That doesn't exist. By the time I'm on the set, I don't have to play the music. The connection's already made. And I think, "This scene opens with this track." And that immediately puts me in my place, and I'm possessed by a certain rhythm. Well, that's one of them. Is that okay? Hey, but in any case, if you came back in a flashback, do you have any particular wish or idea about how you'd like to come back? I'd like to come back sort of appearing to someone. - Like a ghost? - Yeah. That's not really fitting for Money Heist, is it? No, I'm serious. In a real flashback. About a past we haven't seen, or… I think I might like it if… if it involved a lot of dancing. - Please? That's so me. - We have a few things that might… Right? - We could fit that into the hake scene. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - What hake scene? - The night of the hake. - The night of the hake? - The night you're gonna see the Professor… - A little bit… - Lose it. - In a messy state? - Drinking Patxaran. No way. I'll go crazy. I have to be there. - Okay. - Please. I need to be there. - It's a promise. - I want us all to be there. Like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." No drama, you know? So, we can all be there, dancing, like, "Yeah!" - The Professor is smoking. - You're lying. Yes. He has to lose it at least once. And you'd have to be there. It's true. No, please. Tokyo has to… I mean, come on. No. That can't be. How can she miss that? Who was the funny guy or funny girl who put this fish inside my bed? The hake scene was… I think that was one of the toughest exercises I've ever had to do. To stop myself from laughing on set. You know what? Ugh! I resign as the brains behind the gang. I'd much rather be partying. Give me the Patxaran. - Uh, it's more Amaretto than Patxaran. - Just give it to me. Shut up. His anger is more like an implosion than an explosion. It kinda grabs him, and… I'm having a great time, and, well… We are all having a good laugh, and it's all a lot of fun. Let's all relax. Let's all just relax. Okay. My character, Lisbon, is amazed to see the Professor dance. She's never seen anything like it. You have to freak out. - Like, it really surprises me? - Yeah. He's changed. I suppose it has to do with… It's a moment of air and light. Because we're shooting something that's an action series, almost like a war series. All of a sudden, we're having a nice dinner. And we're all, like, relaxed. We had a bit of whiskey. Some shots. Just a little. Stanislavski would have been very proud of us. What did they tell you about the hake? You mentioned the hake scene, and from the look in your eyes, I imagine you must have insider information. But there's something more to the night of the hake. Tokyo returns to give the Professor a message. The rest of us can mess around and get wasted… …because you're on the other side, holding the rope. And she tells him this because no one can talk to the Professor like Tokyo does. She dares to stand up to the Professor and ask him, "What's up with you?" "Why are you doing this?" Do you think it's normal to arrange your shirts by color? Have you seen yourself? Sure. That's what's so great. They complement each other. Because they're so different, and at the same time, they're so honest with each other. And their relationship is so… authentic that this always gives me free rein to really be the real Tokyo. There's another thing about Tokyo and the Professor. When did we ever have a scene like this? And now we have the opportunity to do something really wonderful. That's why we go back into the lion's den. In fact, that's the last time Úrsula appears in the series. It's the end of episode nine, and she tells him that all the others are there because he's there. Because we all believe in you. It's coupled with the fact that it's a tough moment for him. It's like Professor is giving up, and it's like all is lost. Because we know we'll always have the Professor. All of Money Heist is made up of parents, children, families, friends. It's all mixed in there, right? Hmm. All that sometimes-exaggerated emotion. 'Cause I don't want you to live the life I lived. 'Cause I want you to be free. Because it's one of the most universal feelings. To be someone's child. To love a parent. To be a parent. To protect your child. Man, they really fucked me good. Because now the only thing I want is to smell my son. Children look at their parents with utmost admiration. I think it's a kind of homage to parenthood. I'm really glad. That we're here. The two of us together again. Really. And we've looked at parenthood from many different angles. Obviously, we've got Moscow and Denver. The smallest little hitch comes, boom. Let's steal. You're one to talk. You brought me to steal the money factory. In that story, we've seen how difficult it is to bring up a child and try to set him on the right path. So you'll learn to do it intelligently like the Professor. He knows how to do it right. You steal big in one go, not in small amounts and screwing other people over. Denver and his dad are hand in glove. I mean, they could be brothers instead of father and son. - Son! - Hey! - You son of a bitch! - What's up, Dad? Son, do you have… were you born with horns? Why? I don't know. Because you're a scumbag. - Daniel. I never call you Daniel, do I? - Not even once. - Only dickhead, dumbass… - Danny, dickhead… Just that this kid drives me nuts. Honestly. I think that it's really nice to have the chance to see that reunion, in which we also saw the relationship between two fathers. What I needed was someone to believe in me. She's talking about her dad, Papa. Fuck's sake, I know she's talking about their dad. My dad thinks I can't be a robber anymore, but I can do it now better than ever. The father who had to take his daughter's transsexuality on board without any reference points. She's… She's starting to live. She's happy. She's been in jail all her life. Don't put her back. He's a miner who ends up becoming one of the main elements in the Bank of Spain heist. And he's always got an eye on the bank because his daughter's inside. Professor, if you see my daughter, tell her that I love her very much. Money Heist is a lineage. There are families of doctors, right? Families of lawyers. Families who honor a profession. Your grandfather inaugurated our family line. Even the Professor says, "I'm the son of a thief, the brother of a thief." "I hope to be the father to a thief." And I hope someday to be the father of a thief. What he means is that this is a lineage. And you can't run away from who you are, from your lineage. And it's in that process of acceptance that people forge their characters. The character of Berlin sees how betrayal played out in his own home. By his own son and his own wife. They run off together, and that really shakes him up, but at the same time, it's a confirmation that his son is a worthy heir. The other day, I heard an actor I have a lot of respect for say, "Who cares about process?" I really enjoy talking about process, though. I got into painting because I started blotching up some scripts. I wasn't a painter. I started blotching up the scripts, and it helped me. I noticed that it helped me concentrate. So, I started to use that because, clearly, it was helping me focus. The concentration needed for painting or listening to music is different from dialectic concentration. Even if we do have to talk in the scenes, they're completely different. They're different avenues. NOT JUST WILD I'm painting the journey my character undertakes, in… …the first two-thirds of the fifth season. Behind… the act of painting there is a clear desire… to connect directly with a deep current of the things that move us. That doesn't mean that just because you're painting, you're all set, right? But it is true that you neutralize things that aren't helpful for creative work. That's why I sometimes paint before I hear "action." Three minutes, Pedro. The fact is that sometimes trying to understand the dynamics of a shoot is just too crazy, right? And you just keep swimming in the dark like that, waiting for that current to come and lift you up so you can surf that huge wave. Oh, if that happens, it's amazing. It's wonderful. That's not just a nugget. It's a whole goldmine. It's the whole Bank of Spain. "Add the fingers on your hand to the toes on your feet"? Plus your cock and your balls, it adds up to 23. "With your cock and your balls, it adds up to 23." It would be a pity if that phrase didn't rhyme in other languages. You can just stick that in your GPS, and it'll take you directly to the gold. Are you asking me how to say that in English? Fortunately, we have a polyglot on our team. Hands and hands and toes, dick and balls, is twenty-three. I think. He's so good at languages that he's given us a peek at the dubbing process. Okely-dokely. I speak five languages perfectly. Croatian, English, German, Spanish, and Serbian. I like dubbing. I did it a lot in Croatia for cartoons, and it was a big challenge to do it with Marseille. Use pink because she's a girl. Huh? Right now, we were just dubbing Marseille in five languages. What about Danica? In my country, it means "morning star." And Danica? In my country, it means, well, "morning star." We've spent four years between two heists. - You call this a day off? - This? - Yeah? - My God. And although it's been stressful at times… - What a load of shit! - What a load of shit! …we're convinced we'll always remember Money Heist with a smile on our faces. "You use it to have a good time." "He sets up the rules and the board, but he is a dirty trickster." He's great. He's great. The guy is nuts. This is war! He's like a big kid. He never stops. Correct me if I'm wrong, Hovik. He's a machine gun. "The powerful muscles of his esophagus can swallow a living creature putting up a fight because it doesn't wanna be swallowed." Oof. He's a one-man band, huh? Yeah, I've done this before. He's flammable, isn't he? We had a good laugh. Would you look at that. Today's forecast said it would be a sunny day, but… Rain on the set. We had to light a cigarette in the rain. Pfft. One of the guys from the art department had to bring it under an umbrella already lit. Careful. There's a gap there. So that we could smoke and get on with the action, right? Man, they were smoking their cigarettes. I mean, it was impossible. They were smoking like this. All the crazy things that happen in this business. A real show. People wouldn't begin to imagine all those things. And they probably can't believe that we dropped a drone in the water. - There's batteries on it. - Whoa! We were standing there, and suddenly, we heard, "Boom!" I could see the drone sinking, like, with the bubbles rising up. And I looked over and I saw Jesús Colmenar yelling, "No!" They're testing us, the Viking gods. You know the classic smell of burnt drone? That's what it smelled like. It fell into the water with the camera and all, man. It crashed. Or that we had to train a Great Dane but weren't very successful. Calm down, and then he's going to… It's difficult because… he's really heavy. It's not an easy scene. He might knock everything over at any moment. Can he lay down? Can he? Ask him. I think so. Look. Good boy. That's the shot. That's the shot. When I kissed Pedro, he got all excited, and he climbed on me. Or that this is, in fact, what actually happens when we travel. Here's the boss. He does this. "Son, son. Brother. Listen to me." "I never do this. Never. Hmm?" "Thing is, I think that we're turning this into a… co… uh…" "…a comedy." "A comedy." This son of a bitch gets under your skin, and it's absolutely wonderful. The time has come for us to do something. We tell them the truth. Here's a secret. The writers made it to the last day, the last hour, not knowing how the series would end. We had a lot of sleepless nights, to be honest. A lot. And we were really worried because… we didn't have an ending, or we had one that would be… disappointing. "Álex, I can't sleep because I'm so embarrassed about what we came up with." "We don't have an ending." He says, "I haven't slept in three days myself." "What are we gonna do?" We had to shoot. They were asking us for the script, and we didn't have an ending. People kept saying, "Give us the script already." "Didn't you know how it would end?" We said, "Of course." "We're just polishing it up." We had no idea! It's the Spanish picaresque. And at a certain point, we realized that the Viking gold was the key. And then we came up with the idea for the brass, and we said, "Great! What a relief. We have an ending." The ingots that came in those trucks are gold-coated brass. And at that point, it all fell into place. We realized that the Professor had one last ace up his sleeve. And also, it was a much happier ending than anyone could've imagined. They're not fleeing. They come out in a different manner. Under escort and happy, with their lives sorted out. Some of you might think that it's too happy an ending for such a difficult heist. But we're convinced that all of this had to turn out well. It made us really sad, for instance, to think of ending the series, telling the viewers that this harsh reality had prevailed and that, in the end, they were going to kill all these robbers and that their dream just wasn't possible. There's something fundamental in the spirit of everything we've done and of Money Heist itself. It has to be hopeful, and it has to be positive. And we think this was a lot more intelligent, and it made the Professor and his gang even more grandiose, more legendary, and more… epic. There's a sense of… emptiness that stays with you. I get a sense of tenderness, a sense of happiness. Also, a sense of pride. It can't help but affect you. Bravo, Itziar! For me, Money Heist will never be over. It never ends. It's in here forever. Perhaps my most abiding memory is… and it's the tiniest detail, which is the memory of when we got together. And we decided that we were going to make this a heist. That's really the epic part. Making a war series is very epic. But putting Money Heist together from scratch… was a lot more difficult. It was a lot of fun because we didn't know the first thing about heists when we started writing. We had to watch a whole bunch of movies and sort of… …mix them together in our brains. It was like jumping into the abyss. There were several ideas floating around. And I obviously wanted to go for the most complicated one. And in the end, we all went for the one that presented the biggest challenge. I've been here from the beginning. I've started this from scratch. From when we didn't even have an office or anything. So I have to admit that this has now become part of me. That's where it all began. With pure thrill. We had nothing. Just the pure excitement of wanting to tell a story in our own way. Knowing that we had the power to connect with an audience. That we were going to do something that we didn't know how to do. That turned out to be this.
