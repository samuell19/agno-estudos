A week of sun, surf, and long-legged women. - It's tough, isn't it? - Someone's gotta do it. You leave on Sunday, 25th. They're talking $5,000, but I pointed out - if they want the best, they'll have to pay for it. - Bless ya. Leave it to me. I think we can squeeze 'em for $7,000 plus expenses. Okay, any problems, ring me. Ciao. [ receiver clicks ] - [ machine beeps ] - Woman: Hi, Harv! It's Jude. Remember Dad's home movies you were going to transfer to video? Well, where are they, darling brother? Uncle Julius wants to take copies back to the old country. He's only here for another two weeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wiggle outta this one, Boris. Oh, by the way, I found another one of Dad's movies in the basement. It's the whole family at Christmas. I put it in the mail. Make an effort, little brother. - Ring me, today. - [ receiver clicks ] Man #2: You should watch the news tonight, Mr. Denton. - [ receiver clicks ] - [ disconnect tone beeping ] [ machine rewinding, beeps ] Man #2: You should watch the news tonight, Mr. Denton. - [ receiver clicks ] - [ disconnect tone beeping ] Australian Federal Police confirmed that there was a break-in at the offices of the Royal Commission into the British nuclear tests. The break-in early Saturday morning has raised fears about the safety of top secret documents held by the commission. The documents, many of them so secret that some barristers appearing before the commission have been denied access, contained classified and detailed information about the tests conducted in Australia by the British from 1952 until 1964. [ classical music playing ] Great pair of legs, Harv. [ hinge squeaks ] - [ electronic chirping ] - Take that! You big bully! You got the drop on me! - I got you! - Hey, you big bully! What are you doin'? Dang it! Darn it! [ shouts ] [ laughing ] - Heh-hey! - [ chirping stops ] [ whispering ] We're in trouble. [ door closes ] You have him on weekends. Come on, silly. [ guns chirping ] - [ chirping stops ] - Don't encourage your father. Woman: Go to sleep now. Come on. - Boy: Oh, but I'm not sleepy. - Out. You think she wants me to leave? Can't you stay tonight? You can sleep in my bed. Nah, matey. You sleep tight. Battles to fight. Give us a hug... Both: ...with all your might! - And no dog. - Oh, come on, Pat. A kid his age needs a dog. He needs a father with brains. He needs mates to kick a footy with, things like that. Harvey, who's going to look after this dog, huh? Who's going to wash it? Who's going to feed it? Look, you don't wash a dog. It's bad for 'em! Feeding him? Look, Dom can do that. He's six years old, for God's sakes. He wouldn't know which end of the can opener to use. It'll be me again, won't it? Pat, I told you. This plant's getting too much sun. It needs shade. It's an indoor plant. Look, I could call around every other day. No, you couldn't. It's taken me three months to get him used to this. A child his age needs routine, stability. That's just what a dog will give him-- routine, stability. Look, wait till you see this pup. He's irresistible, just like me. Well, that's just what I need, Spot. But Dom likes to have me around. Please, Harvey. Not a dog. You used to, too, remember? One child in the house was enough. Lean meat, bones. No canned shit. It's what you give a dog. Don't forget, you promised to show cartoons at his party on Sunday. - Now go home. - I am home. [ shouting ] Was anything else stolen, apart from the films? Harvey: No, nothing. You don't make blue movies, do you, Harvey? Come off it. What was on these films? Like I said, it's home movies and some other stuff my father shot when I was a kid. Who'd want to steal home movies? Andy Warhol? [ laughing ] I love the smell of palm trees in the morning. Agent: Napalm, you pleb. Harvey... you said these films were 16 mil. Yeah. Most home movies are super 8, aren't they? My father was a professional cameraman. He made docos, "Movietown News," stuff like that. So on the weekends he'd bring home the leftover stock and do the family pics. You're sure there's nothing in these films that someone else might want? Yeah, sure. No other unusual scenes? No. [ distant siren wailing ] - Man: Hello? Mr. Denton? - [ dog barking ] Oh, uh, this is the Wagging Tail dog kennel. That pup you ordered is ready for collection, okay? Good. Judy: Harv, it's me again. I just got home. It's a complete mess. Someone tried to rob the place. Stuff everywhere. It's really weird. Nothing seems to be gone. The police are here now. It gives me the creeps. Ring me? Man #2: ...news tonight, Mr. Denton. [ answering machine rewinding ] [ disconnect tone beeping ] Man #2: ...news tonight, Mr. Denton. - Camera one, zoom in. - Focus. - Set the K.? - Setting the K now. Okay, back out. [ chatter ] I'm telling you, it's not just an ordinary burglary. Why did they only take the films? - And what about the weird telephone message? - I haven't got time. [ beeping ] - Harvey: What about my films? - Pat: Who would want to steal that? [ crew chattering ] Four, three... [ audio rewinding ] ...resolute and thereby advance the cause of peace for us and our children. And in Sydney today, Australian Federal Police confirmed that there was a break-in at the offices... - Pat: Find anything? - ...into the British nuclear tests. No. Nothing. - What's that? - Running sheet. - Of the news? - Mmm. Let me see it. Now, why is number seven scrubbed out? Not enough time. Technical problem. Would that be the only reason? - It happens all the time. - Well, could we find out exactly? [ sighs ] Hmm. [ audio rewinding ] Pat: Ron, Pat Denton here. Fine. Last night's news, item seven was scrubbed. They what? What was it about? I mean, did you see it? Newscaster: ...sitting in Adelaide, there a sworn statement by a veteran of the atomic tests who claimed he had evidence to prove that nomadic Aborigines died as a direct result of the tests. Pat: Can't you be more specific? Newscaster: The witness refused to elaborate when pressed by Justice MacKenzie... - Pat: You can tell me. - ...and instead accused the British and Australian governments of a whitewash. - Pat: Thanks. Bye. - The commission will now travel to elbourne where-- I don't know what it stands for. It's just called a D-notice. It has to do with national security. What? You mean, anyone can march in here and confiscate tapes? No, not anyone. Intelligence, ASIO. It's only happened once since I've been here, during the Falklands War. - Did he say what was on the tapes? - No. All he'd say was it came from the Adelaide station. Something about a plane being dug up. - Plane? What's the connection? - Probably none. - Harvey: What about my films? - Pat: Don't ask me, ask ASIO. Woman: Can I help you, sir? Uh, I'm not really sure. This is ASIO? That's correct, sir. Who would you like to see? I don't really know, exactly. Well, the duty officer handles general inquiries. Your name, sir? Denton. Harvey Denton. If you'd like to take a seat, Mr. Denton. [ dialing phone ] There's a Mr. Denton in reception. I don't know. Bye. [ Muzak playing softly ] Harvey: Where's that middle camera? Man: Why don't you just sit and wait for the duty officer, sir? Is that middle camera upstairs? Where's the bloke on that camera? - Man: Just sit and wait, sir. - He's got my bloody film! Hey, listen, mate. Hey, you! [ door closes ] [ door opens, closes ] [ machines droning ] [ guns cocking ] - [ quiet chatter ] - [ typewriters clacking ] Man: Mr. Denton, my name's Danny Trebilcock. I'm the officer in charge of this-- Look, the films, that's-- that's all I want. They're on their way up now. I think you can leave now, gentlemen. Thank you. Well, you've certainly put a little excitement into their day. Would you like a drink? I'm afraid I've only got Perrier. Is that okay? Harvey: Yeah, fine. Surprised us all, turning up like this. Harvey: Look, I just want the films back. I must apologize for the way in which they were seized. Some of us are trying to upgrade the image of the organization. But old habits die hard, I suppose. We have a real problem-- uh, sit down-- attracting the caliber of personnel we want. Cheers. [ sighs ] What do you know about your father's death? My father? He drowned off the coast of South-- Where'd you get this? What was he doing when he died? Well, he was a cameraman. He-- he died when I-- He was working for the army. He was filming the British A-bomb tests. We believe that is your father. Shot through the head, close range. Recognize this? Uh... - Um, I think so-- - [ knock ] - Trebilcock: Yes? - [ door opens ] Oh, just place them on the desk. Thanks, Jenny. This plane was buried in November '54. They flew it through the mushroom cloud. It was so radioactive, they had to bury it. They dug it up for the Royal Commission. The body... was a complete surprise. - But why would-- - We don't know. So, the films... Nothing. [ whirring ] [ metallic tapping ] [ projector whirring ] [ answering machine beeping ] Man: Hello, Harvey. This is Uncle Julius. Harvey: Yes, Uncle. Oh, Harvey, did you receive the present? Oh, look. Thanks again for the socks, Uncle. Just in case if you couldn't come up before I left, I asked Judy to send them. Yeah, I'll-- I'll be up the first chance I get. Listen, is Judy there? I have to speak to her for a minute. Yeah. Judy, it's Harvey. - Judy: Harvey. - Hello. Hey, listen, you mentioned something about a burglary, Judy. I guess it was just some local kids up to mischief. By the way, do you remember the exact date of Dad's death? Mmm, let me think. 12 of November. And that was 1953, wasn't it? Yeah. That's right. Why? No, no, I was just-- just wondering. Listen, I'll ring you before I come up, all right? I'll speak to you later. Bye-bye. Hang on! Don't forget to video the home movies. No, no. Consider it done. Newscaster: ...from the prime minister and President Reagan, reaffirming both nations wish to continue a strong and dynamic security relationship. Both sides stressed the importance of the ANZUS Treaty and have continued cooperation on defense and other matters under the alliance. Australia's a responsible ANZUS ally, an important trading partner, and a trusted friend. Newscaster: Aides did not rule out the discussion on the Star Wars project or U.S. bases in Australia may take place over the next few days. And in Melbourne, the last week of the Royal Commission into the British atomic tests is underway. Pat Denton filed this report after this morning's session. Pat: The first day's hearing at the commission in Melbourne has been both emotional and sensational. Claims by Australian atomic test veterans and Aborigines have been categorically denied by legal counsel for the British government. Also today, details were released concerning the discovery of a radioactively contaminated aircraft dug up in the South Australian desert. When questioned, British representatives would make no comment. - [ reporters clamoring ] - Excuse me, Mr. Hooking. Do you have any comment to make about allegations of a radioactive aircraft dug up in South Australia? [ overlapping chatter ] Well, at this stage it appears the British are maintaining a stiff upper lip knowing that next week marks the end of the commission's investigations and time is running out. This is Pat Denton at the Royal Commission. Our meteorologists, scientists, and fallout experts agreed it was completely safe. There was absolutely no possibility of contamination or risk to the population centers of Australia. And you did take into account the possibility of fallout affecting Aboriginals? Of course. We got along very well with the Aborigines. At one stage we even supplied them with blankets. It, uh, gets very cold out in the mud bowl. And when some American colonels visited, we showed them the blacks' camp. It was a service we provided. - Just like Disneyland. - [ laughter ] He said he came across a whole lot of dead Aboriginals, him and two other servicemen. I reported it. Next day he was transferred, I think. I never saw him again. Hooking: Your Honor, I-- I'm a little lost as to what to even say. Then sit down and don't say anything, Mr. Hooking. If Your Honor will permit me. Yes. What is it? Hooking: The witness is wasting the commission's time. His evidence isn't only hearsay, there is no point in-- Woman: Your Honor, Mr. Ballantyne should be allowed to finish his testimony. Agreed. Sit down, Mr. Hooking. Continue. This thing about the dead Aboriginals was going about. Everyone was talking about it. All the servicemen. And as a consequence, there was some sort of parade and you were addressed by one of the British officers. Ballantyne: We told him again what happened. He said the British government paid a lot of money for the tests and if news about the incident got out and about, a lot of money would be wasted. Commissioner: And when he addressed you, how would you describe the way in which he spoke? Well, he spoke to us like they always spoke to us. Like a little pommy turd speaking to the colonials. Telling us what we had to do, or else. - Your Honor. - If I were you, Mr. Hooking, I'd quit while I was behind. [ people murmuring ] Commissioner: Or else what? He reminded us that we'd signed a secrecy act. If we broke it, we could go to jail or be put to death. [ people murmuring ] Commissioner: Mr. Ballantyne, you were stationed for some weeks - in a camp in the forward area... - Excuse me. ...of the Maralinga test site. Ballantyne: Yes, sir, that's right. Don't get involved. Leave it to us. Commissioner: Even at the time, you thought it was odd that everything was so open. Don't get involved? My father was murdered. It's our job. We have the resources and-- Listen to me. Listen. Just hear me. I've been doing some thinking about this. Now, just-- just tell me if I'm right or wrong. You don't have to say anything. We cannot divulge any information. You don't have to divulge anything. Just tell me if I'm right or wrong, all right? Ballantyne: We'd always find Aboriginals on the wrong side of the fence. Okay, well, um... I think my father saw something or filmed something he wasn't supposed to. And whatever that film was has got some major bearing on this, right? - Listen-- - Well, you haven't said no, have you? I want to find out who killed him - and why he was killed. - Just listen to me. This thing is a damn side bigger than you think. You do not have all the pertinent information. It's a political minefield and you go blundering about, you could mess it up. Just leave it to the people who know-- No way, man. Come on. What would you do? You find out your father was murdered, what would you do? Commissioner: Call Mrs. Trilby Tjapalijarri. Walemari: I want you to tell it to all the people here, what did you think you saw? Tjapalijarri: We thought we saw the great white s-snake clearly digging water out. - Was it a big noise? - Loud noise. - And-- and what did you call it? - Puyu. - Walemari: Puyu. - Excuse me? Uh, the-- the black mist, Your Honor. Please go on. So, would you tell the court again about the puyu? What-- what was it? A sticky black cloud. Walemari: And where did it come? Tjapalijarri: Fell on the trees, on the ground. Mm-hmm. And what happened to the people? The people became sick. Vomiting, sore eyes. - Walemari: Right. - Tjapalijarri: And some died. There were deaths? It's taboo, Your Honor. My people aren't allowed to speak of the dead. It would help, in the event of compensation to your people. Compensation? You killed their dreaming. Commissioner: I see Mr. Hooking has something to entertain us with. Do you wish to cross-examine the witness? No, Your Honor. But given the opportunity to say anything at all, I should like to express the disadvantage we all suffer, with due respect to my learned friend, in not being versed in tribal Aboriginal mythology. And to restate our strong objection at anecdotal evidence and the reliance upon that from choice witnesses. Yes, we've heard you before on that. Your Honor, my people assert that members of their family and tribes died. Tribal custom prevents them from talking about it. Your Honor, we keep hearing of reports of sickness, blindness, and death from areas which we contend could not possibly have been affected. But where is this hard evidence? [ chattering ] Trebilcock: Denton? Trebilcock: Call me anytime, day or night. - That was him. - Who? The ASIO bloke. It's all come out about the plane. - Mm. - Nothing about a body. Look, I saw the photos. - You sure? - Of course I'm sure. I'm off. But I want to know everything that happens. - Okay? - Sure. See you. [ elevator bell dings ] Denton? Yeah? - Carl Denton? - No, his son. Thought you were too young. We saw your father's films of the bomb tests. He spent a lot of time with my people. Do you, uh, have an interest in this? Perhaps. What sort of interest? Don't know yet. Is your father still alive? No, he died in, uh, 1953. Pity. I would've liked to talk to him. Anyone who was there. It's our word against the, uh, experts. After all... we're only simple tribesmen. Anything might help us. The smallest memory, souvenir. - [ elevator bell dings ] - Anything. [ man coughing ] It'd be in here, somewhere. [ laughing ] - Listen, I got a date, somewhere around-- - Eh? - I've got a date somewhere around the beginning-- - What? Around the beginning of November 1953. - November 1953? - Yeah. November 1953, put your hand up. [ laughing ] We close at 6:00. If you're not out by then, I'll man a search party. [ laughing, coughing ] Gotcha. [ coughing ] Yeah. He printed 400 feet of positive stock. Isn't that unusual for a cameraman to process and print his own material? No. Army stuff, see? Top secret. We weren't allowed to touch it. Army blokes did all their own stuff. Ha. Afraid there were Reds hiding in the darkroom. [ laughing ] Yeah, thanks for your help. Hey! How is your father? - He died. - Give him my regards. What subject? The British A-bomb test in the '50s. Oh, the Royal Commission biz, I've got to imagine, huh? Besides, it's classified anyway. You need ministerial permission. Uh, but this is where they're stored. Classified. Oh, there is one other. It's a film about basic training. Where is it? Y-yeah, it's, um... "A Day in the Life of a Regular Soldier." It was made in-- in 1959. Look, I know it's late, but if you could just tell me if it's here, I'll know whether it's worth coming back tomorrow. All right. All right. Now, what was it called again? "A Day in the Life of..." - "Of a Regular Soldier." - "...a Regular Soldier." - 1959. - That's right. - Thanks for your help. - Mm-hmm. No, the computer's down-- [ whistling ] [ door opens ] [ light switch clicks ] [ sighs ] Shit. [ keyboard clicking ] [ beeping ] [ music playing ] Narrator: The eyes of the world are on Maralinga, a remote village on the edge of Australia's great desert, as man's most revolutionary discovery, the atom bomb, is tested. The veil of secrecy is lifted for the visit of the Australian prime minister Mr. Menzies, who finds that the atomic atmosphere is developing healthy, young Australians. At the site itself, last-minute preparations are completed. Construction of dugouts and trenches for the protection of scientific instruments to record the blast. Dummies are dressed and placed in strategic spots to test the effects of the exploding atom on military clothing and equipment. Weather conditions are just right, so the valiant carrying this awesome weapon heads for the target. The firing control desk flashes its message. The countdown begins, and it's backs to the blast. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [ explosion ] Our Australian servicemen get the best view of all, only a mile from ground zero. A triumph for British scientists and the Australian technicians who made possible the tests at Maralinga. [ keyboard clicking ] [ keyboard clicking ] Bastards. [ muttering ] [ keyboard clicking ] You beauty. [ projector whirring ] [ projector stops ] Man: You were told, then, to say that the atomic cloud was a raincloud? Well, it was suggested. So you were instructed to lie to the Australian public and in fact to cover it up? Man #2: Yes. Man #2: And subsequently, Sir William Penney, the director of the tests, expressed concern-- Look, I found a film. I'm not sure what it is. It's deserted huts, vehicles, army stuff, but there's no name to identify what it is. X200. Just a coordinate on a map. A top-secret facility. They demolished it straight after the bomb tests. - When can I see it? - Tonight. Look, come to my place after about 10:00. I'll write it down for you. Man: Whereas the observed trajectory three hours after the explosion was quite the opposite. Yes, it's quite a variation. There must've been a wind change in the upper atmosphere. You can't always predict them. To your knowledge, were there any settlements in the path of the atomic cloud? No. [ Dom chattering ] Harvey: Look at this. They just fled. - [ Dom chattering ] - Shh. Shh. That's it. [ sighs ] - You don't know where this camp is? - No. Well, all we do know is whoever was there left in a hurry. - Why? - Easy. Avoid some sort of danger. Unplanned event? Accident? Yeah, yeah, like an atomic bomb going off. Well, that would be incredible if there were some proof. - What do you think that is? - That is some empty buildings. Look, there's gotta be more. He shot 400 feet of film. Now, there's 340 there, so there's 60 feet still missing-- 60 feet. Now, that could be the proof for everything the British are denying. That could be. That could be the story of the year. It could be more than that, you know? What are you going to do with that? It goes with me. Woodward and Bernstein, eh? - Leave me the copy. - Why? Precaution. You never know. All right, swap. This for dinner tonight. You don't give up, do you? On one condition. Change your shirt and have a shower. You're on. Molly's, 7:00. Harvey: G'day. So... we struck gold. Eh? The film. Oh. Right. How come you blokes missed it? You didn't make any copies, did you? No, cut me off at the pass. It's not all there, you know. Well, the last couple of minutes are missing and that's just a print. I couldn't find the negative. I am impressed. If you ever feel like a change in career... Nah, I'll leave that to you fellas. [ laughs ] [ men laughing ] Harvey's voice: G'day. This is Harvey Denton's answering machine. If you'd like to leave a message after the beep, I'll get back to you. - [ machine beeps ] - Pat: Hello. It's me. Listen, I can't make it to Molly's at 7:00. I'll be there about 8:00, okay? Bye. [ phone ringing ] - Pat Denton here. - Pat, about din-- I'm out, but my answering machine is always in. - Shit! - Please don't waste your call. - Leave a message after the beep. - [ beeps ] [ chattering ] [ camera shutter clicking ] [ tires screeching ] Aah! [ grunting ] [ grunting ] - Aah! - [ knife clatters ] Aah! [ train rattling ] [ gunshot ] Newscaster: For Jim Weimer and Steve Thomas, the legacy of Maralinga could be an early grave. To be blunt, neither of them have long to live. Man: The cancer rate in our members, as the British test bears, is four times greater than the normal civilian population. Four times greater, and I'm one of them! [ dial tone ] Man: You believe that much radiation will cause death? [ chatter continues on TV ] Man #2: A short time after it happened, I developed this rare form of cancer. - Right down here. - [ phone ringing ] It's cobalt therapy. - Trebilcock: Yes? - Trebilcock? Now look, what in Christ's name's going on? Denton, hold on. Where are you? Now, those hoons, who the hell are they? They're not mine! It's the British! They want to destroy the film. Now whatever you do, don't move till we get there. Where are you? Denton? Where are you? Denton! ...finishes hearing evidence this week. But there still may be hope. A test veteran claims to have solid evidence. His name is Prosper Gaffney, and we have him on the phone right now from Nimman Brook in South Australia. Hello, Mr. Gaffney. You claim to have evidence which will expose what really went on during the tests in the '50s. [ Gaffney, distorted voice ] I said before we started, I didn't come to talk about that. - Man: Yes, but you said that-- - Gaffney: Are you daft? I said the time will come and the whole world will know. I'm here to talk about the Royal Commission because it's a farce. Nothing will come of it. It's a whitewash. And they'll all burn in hell-- Menzies and Attlee and Lord Penney. Man: In the British Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher-- Gaffney: And she can burn, too! We'll all burn together. Man: This evidence that you claim to have-- Gaffney: Burn in hell. And the fires won't be hot enough. Not enough to make up for the sins of the thousand years of burning. Not in a thousand years of burning! Dom on phone: Hey, you were going to show cartoons. Harvey: Sorry, old mate, but this is important. I have to do it for my dad. Well, you'd do it for me, wouldn't you? - Dom: Yeah, I suppose. - Good boy. Now listen. Put your mom back on, Dom. Eh, and, Dom, Dom. Listen, I really love you, son. Pat on phone: Where were you? I waited an hour. They murdered him, the ASIO guy! - [ kids clamoring ] - What are you talking about? - Harvey: Outside the restaurant. - [ children singing ] Harvey: Look, I can't talk. Your phone's probably bugged or something. But just make sure someone's with you and Dom all the time, okay? Harvey, what's happening? It's the film! They want the film. The tape. - They destroyed it. - Who? The British, ASIO-- I don't know yet. Harvey? We're a team, aren't we? - Harvey? - Yeah? Take care of yourself. Yeah, don't worry about me. I do. Excuse me, um, I'm looking for Prosper Gaffney. Thank you. [ helicopter blades whirring ] [ Gaffney, distorted voice ] What do you want? Are you Prosper Gaffney? You're disturbing my work. Piss off. Out. You left a message on my telephone machine. Who told you that? I recognize the voice. What voice? I don't know you from Adam. Why would I leave you any bleeding message? That's what I want to find out. I don't suppose you've got a name? Harvey Denton. Well, Mr.-- Mr. Denton. I'll not be the one to spoil the good name of outback hospitality. So you can stay the night. And then you can bugger off back to wherever it was you sprung from. Bloody awful, isn't it? Hey! What are you doing, you silly old black bastard? Blind as a bloody bat. One of them, uh, mushroom clouds got him. What do you mean? He was downwind of one of these bomb tests. Most of his mates died young. He lost his eyesight. Now, me... I have a throat cut. [ chuckles ] Now, you worked on the tests. Worked on 'em? I chose all the bloody sites. Didn't I, Charlie? I came out with the other Brits. A specialist. I chose the exact spot to let them off. The exact spot. Ground zero. We were having the time of our lives. Splitting the mighty atom for queen and country. Then we saw the first one blow. It was as if the earth cracked open and we'd released the fires of hell. Smashed the bush. Not a living thing in miles. And that great big black cloud... Eh, Charlie? The scientists cheered and danced a jig. And Charlie and all his lot got the legacy. One mighty explosion. And he paid for it for the rest of his life. The day of retribution is upon us. And we shall all burn. Burn in hell... for eternity. Harvey: Do you know what's on the film? I'll take it to the commission. That's a circus. The Aboriginal legal guy. Black man in a white man's suit. Don't trust anybody. That's where your father made his mistake. - [ chattering ] - [ dog barking ] [ chattering ] [ speaking native language ] [ baby crying ] [ speaking native language ] Gaffney: They've only just come back here. [ speaking native language ] He says he knew your father. He was a good friend of your father. Your father and I... we got lost. It was the devil's work. As soon as I saw the place, I knew that. Keep a big place like that secret. Something unnatural was going on there. The Geiger counter was almost off the scale. The silly buggers. They thought of everything except the winds changing. I wanted to piss off, but your father... he wanted to take some shots. I stayed on guard by the Jeep... with Charlie there. He was gone a long time. When he came back... it was really strange. He wouldn't tell us what he'd seen, but he-- he told me not to mention we'd ever been near the place. A week later, he came back and he-- he wanted me to drive him to the bush again. He was in a great hurry. When we got to where we were going, he-- he told me to stay... by the Jeep. He had a box... that he wouldn't let out of his sight. But I snuck a look at it while he was asleep. There was a film can in it. I didn't have to guess what it was. A few days after we got back to base... he was transferred. And we never saw him again. They murdered him. [ helicopter blades whirring ] [ distant explosion ] [ distant explosion ] Wake up! Wake up! - Wake up! - What? Where's Charlie? He would never let a fire go out. Probably gone for a piss or something. Go find him. - Hmm? - Now! Hang on. I just woke up. - [ groans ] - [ wind howling ] All right, all right! They're out there somewhere. - Who? - The bastards who killed Charlie. He fell down a gully, didn't he? Wake up, man. He heard something. He could hear a flea fart at half a mile. They're out there. [ sighs ] You can't get-- get any further with me on your back. Go to that dry stream there. At the top there's caves there. It's in there. Safer than a bank, eh? Nobody comes here except the blacks. And they would never go in there. It's... sacred. [ flashlight clicks ] [ bats screeching ] Harvey: Hey! We found it! We found it! [ helicopter blades whirring ] [ alarm blaring ] It's the negative! All of it, 400 feet! [ engine starts ] I.D. please, sir. What are American soldiers doing out here? Under the Joint Facilities treaty, this property is under the jurisdiction of the government of the United States of America. Piss off. - Harvey: Driver's license do? - Soldier: Thank you. Harvey: It's okay. They'll check with ASIO. Gaffney: Listen to me! [ soldier speaking indistinctly ] I told them. I said we'd stumbled on something. I didn't know what he shot. And they said he'd be transferred. He was my mate. [ soldier speaking indistinctly ] I was drunk. Nothing changes. Only the accents. And the bloody uniforms. We're leaving. - What are you doing? - Drive! I mean it. - Pull over! - [ gunshot ] Get out. Get out? What are you talking about? I know what I'm doing. Out! Here, take this. Do it. For your father and for the rest of us. I never rang you. That wasn't me. Don't trust anyone. [ soldier speaking indistinctly ] Whoa! Get! [ engine revving ] [ chatter ] [ phone ringing ] Pat's voice: Hello. Pat Denton here. I'm out, but my answering machine is always in. [ receiver clicks ] I got the negative, all of it! They came to the station. There's a D-notice. - We've gotta get a print made. - Don't give it to me. - We'll do it back at the station. - No, they'll only take it! - Look, they won't even know we're there. - There's no time now. - What do you mean, there's no time? - There's no time! - Ugh, look. Where's your car? - You don't understand! - I do! You don't understand! - What's the problem? Do you know what people have been through for this? - Just listen! Just listen! - Aw, piss off, will ya? - Come on, we've gotta go! - They put a D-notice on the film! It'll be buried forever. Let him go! Look, the commission is winding up. They've only got about an hour to go. In there is your only chance. - Let's go. Let's go! Grab the camera! - Man: Grab what you can. I'll take that. No way. Excuse me. Would you mind telling me what all this is about? - Switch that off! - Could you give me your name? Under what authority are you detaining this man? Just switch off that camera! Excuse me. Would you mind telling me who you rep-- ...cooperation from the British government in regard to the question of availability and access in it to assist. And claims of my government being obstructionist have been - unwarranted and unfair. - I've got it. - Hooking: Every effort-- - Commissioner: What is this? [ people murmuring ] I've got important evidence. It's the film I told you about, Mr. Walemari! Commissioner: What the hell's happening here? Walemari: Your Honor, this could be vital evidence. Order! [ people chattering ] Somebody tell me what's going on! I've got a film and it's important evidence for this commission, Your Honor. You're in contempt! Your Honor, I request an adjournment-- - Please, Your Honor! - Commissioner: Shut up! Shut up! Everybody, shut up! [ chatter stops ] This is my commission. You'll listen to me. Look, this is important evidence! - Would you believe me? - In these chambers I decide what's important. There are procedures for presenting evidence. That's what I want to do, but they're trying to stop me because they know what's on this film! What have you got? It had better be bloody good. - This evidence cannot be accepted at this time! - Quiet, you! This film proves that it's all lies! - [ people murmuring ] - Where was this film taken? It was taken at Emu Field near Maralinga. [ people murmuring ] Under the terms of this commission, it is neither right nor proper at this stage-- The outcome of this commission will decide that. Is that it? Yes, this is the film. Trebilcock: Your Honor? This film comes under the Military Secrets Act, signed by Prime Minister Menzies, and it is therefore classified. - Bullshit! Don't listen to him! - That's enough, that's enough. You are acting in an official capacity, Mr. Trebilcock? Bailiff. Bailiff, the film, please. All right. You can have the film. But it has to be printed. Now, I wanna be there when it's printed and I want Mr. Walemari with me. You, sir, accompany me to my chambers. This commission will adjourn until further notice. Bailiff: All rise! [ people chattering ] So you haven't actually seen what's on this film. Well, that's the negative, but I've seen part of a print struck from that. Your Honor, obviously I cannot allow anyone to see this film until it's been viewed by us and we've determined its security status. If Mr. Denton's right about what's on this film, it could affect my findings. Now, if you seize the film, I'll subpoena it. Too many people know it exists. The legal battle's going to hold me up and it'll be bad publicity for you fellas. What I'm suggesting is I view the film-- Hang on, that's my film and I've got a right to see it. The film belongs to the government. It can only be viewed by an appointed agent with a security clearance. I am an appointed agent. So what I'll do is I'll view the film and then report to you. Can you do that straight away? I can't tell you what's on the film, but I can tell you if I'll be subpoenaing it. Mr. Trebilcock. Nothing. There was no image. The laboratory said it was long-term exposure to radiation, cobalt-60. You're advised to have a medical checkup as soon as possible. No. That can't be true. Let me see it. What have you done? You've done something to it. You swapped it over, you bastards! What have you done to the fucking film? They've swapped it! Look! I'll expose this, I'm telling you. If it's the last fucking thing I do, I'll expose it. Go home and forget about it. The film was all that mattered. We both lost. Now just go home and forget about it. - Who are you? - None of your business. Well, where's Mrs. Berkowitz? She moved out a few days ago. I'm the new tenant. Could you get out of my way, please? You're a bloody spy, aren't you? You tell Trebilcock I know what's going on. No more of his bullshit. You tell him that, all right? You tell him to leave me alone! Newscaster: Then at a press conference after the final round of talks, the prime minister confirmed that the American lease on the U.S. secret installations base at Pine Gap would be renewed. The Royal Commission into the British nuclear tests wound up its investigation today after sitting for over 11 months. We now cross live to our commission reporter, Pat Denton, who was there for the final session. It's been an emotional last day - at the nuclear test inquiry. - [ machine beeps ] - Time seems to have run out... - G'day, this is Harvey... ...for Aborigines and test veterans. And yet, unanswered questions still hang like a nuclear cloud over the whole Australian-British joint test project. Martin over phone: Harvey, Martin here! Where on earth are you? If you don't get your tail down here-- Pat: Did British neglect lead to injury and deaths? Will they spend the billions of dollars necessary to clean up their deadly mess? Well, whatever the outcome, it appears that Aborigines and test veterans may once again be the innocent victims of a secret political agenda. - [ machine beeps ] - A few hours ago, a man disrupted the inquiry... - G'day, this is Harvey... - ...claiming he had a film proving British deceit. Official sources later announced it was a hoax... - Dom on phone: Dad... - ...but would give no further details. - Dom: She said I might get squashed by a truck. - This is Pat Denton. G'day, matey. Listen, don't worry about what your mother said. We'll all sit down and talk about it, all right? Well, great! When did you get back? Oh, just a little while ago. Did you find your dad's film? Actually, Dom, something happened to it. What happened, Dad? Dad? I tried to find out. I... I did try. I'll explain it to you later, Dom. I'm really tired. [ steam whistling ] Dom: Nan said you were brave. Dad? What happened to my grandfather? He just died, matey. When? A long time ago. He tried to help some people. You see, fathers, they're just like everyone else. They die. Dad, will you come home? Yes, Dom. Yes, I am. When? - Hang on. - Dad? Dad? Dad? [ teakettle whistling ] [ music playing ]
