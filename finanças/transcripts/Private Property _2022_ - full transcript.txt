I always just did whatever I wanted. I always used to cheat. Morning, Jorge. Good morning, Kathryn. Because I was young and I didn't care. I remember once I went to a bar with one of my boyfriends. And I saw this man across the room. The handsomest man I've ever seen. He was so alive. And I was staring... I couldn't help it. And then he looked at me... with just one look. And I followed, like I was tethered to him. Like he had hypnotized me. It was a single bathroom, but he didn't lock the door. Once I walked in, we grabbed each other, he threw me on top on the sink, ripped my underwear off, and fucked me. It probably only lasted a minute, but I came. When he was done, he kissed me. I was still shivering and then he left the bathroom. So, I got myself together and I went back to the bar. And he was still there with his friends. And he smiled at me one more time. And that's the last time we looked or talked to each other. Some people would call me a slut for that, but I honestly think it was one of the most romantic moments of my life... in a very... slutty sort of way. Jorge? Jorge? - Hello. - Hello. - This is Mrs. Carlyle? - Yeah, this is she. Hello, Mrs. Carlyle, I'm Javier Del Toro from LA Bloom Gardening. Yeah, funny you called actually. Um, my gardener, Jorge Torres, he was supposed to come... Miss, I would like to inform you that your gardener, Jorge Torres, no longer works for the company. Did he switch companies by chance, - because I might just... - Uh, ma'am, he was detained. Oh. But I-I will have a new gardener for you this afternoon. Hello, um, Miss, uh... Miss Carlyle? Mrs. Yeah. So, this tree here needs to be... I think that's pretty much it. I would say that you can start now, - but you don't have any tools. - Oh, no. I'm not supposed to start until tomorrow. - Oh. - Thank you, Mrs. Carlyle. Shit. Is something wrong? The door's locked. Crap. This is so not okay. I was sending an email and it was uploading. I can get you in, but you're gonna have to promise me something. What? That you won't call the cops. - Thank you, so much. - No problem. Hey, uh, one more thing. Did you know Jorge? The gardener who used to work here? - No, ma'am. - Right, of course, I figured you wouldn't, um... I knew of him, though. Yeah? Yeah. Seemed like a decent guy. It was too bad. - Too bad about what? - You didn't hear? They rounding him up. [upbeat music playing I missed you today. I missed you. I wish the Anderson's would sell their place. They're asking too much. It's just been empty forever. It'd be nice to have some neighbors. Okay, no more skinny dipping with new neighbors. You know, I actually, um, swam laps for an hour today. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. I'm just trying to stay in shape. Oh. I can see that. Come on. Oh, this table still wobbles, I hate that. Baby, you wanna catch a movie? Don't you have to read that script? You know there's, um, there's a-a part. There's like a supporting part for a woman my age and I don't know if you do it, maybe you can get me a connection maybe, um, audition for the director? If I do it, and that's a big if, I'll put your name on the list to audition, but that's as far as I can go. You want to get it on your own terms, don't you? Can we light a fire? Sure, go for it. Won't we have to turn the gas back on? I'll do it. - I can do it. - No, no, no, no. I-I... I'm sure he's good for it. I mean, his cash position sucks, but his tax position is nothing but capital gains. He'll finance the debt. It just floats for two years for Christ's sake. Yeah. I'm going to bed. Yeah, it's all figured out. Okay, well, um, what about a smaller part? The ex-girlfriend? Yeah, just a minute. Oh, hi, Mrs. Carlyle. I just wanted to let you know that I was here and ready to get started. Okay, great. Thank you. - Oh, uh, uh, ma'am? - Yes? Well, you see the ivy on that tree there? It's falling apart. If you don't mind, I'd like to start there. - Sure, whatever you want. - Okay. I only ask, 'cause I want my clientele to trust me as a valued collaborator on their home. You know, more than just a, uh, a gardener. A, uh, you know, a landscape architect. Well, that's very sweet, but why don't you start by doing a good job on your first day? Hmm? Yes, ma'am. It's all improv. He lets you say whatever you want. Wait, there's no script. No, well, there's a structure but the character is mine. That's what he said, "She is yours". - Sounds awesome. - What are you doing? Uh, you know, just auditioning and cleaning the house. Meaning your luxurious mansion in Laurel Canyon while I share a three-bedroom with five people. Don't pout. It's unbecoming. I miss the hustle. Hustle sucks. Enjoy your freedom. Oh, I gotta go. I love you. Do you want some lemonade? Ben? Do you want some lemonade? Yeah, I'd love some. You know I never got to, um, thank you for letting me in the house. Yeah, what'd you have to send so bad? Uh, an audition. I didn't get it, so... - Wait, you're an actress? - Sort of. Trying to be. Aspiring. - Anything I would have seen? - No, probably not. I've just done, you know, a couple of short films. Um, I actually have one premiering tonight. Wow, cool. Where do you get to go to the premiere? Oh, uh, it's online. I mean, it's kind of how people are seeing things, anyways. That's so true. And I get it, because I'm a... Well, I'm a rapper, you know. Really? Yeah. I'm a landscape architect, too, but, I mean, my real passion is music. Wow. Quite the Renaissance man. Hey, don't make fun of me. Oh, I-I wasn't. I swear, I wasn't. Okay. - So, can I hear some of it? - Some what? - Your music. - Oh. Uh... Oh, come on, you know you want to. Oh, man. Yeah, okay, okay. Hmm. Yeah, uh, okay, hey. ♪ Hey, Ms. Carlyle look at that smile ♪ ♪ Light up the world like a sun dial ♪ ♪ Yeah, many men would go on trial ♪ Just to get a look at that pretty smile ♪ Smile. Thank you. Hey, you know, how you could really thank me? I mean, like a... Like really, really thank me? You mind if I jump in the pool? - Oh, um... - But just for a second, okay. It's so hot and I'm sweaty and sticky. I've been staring at that water all day. Well, you don't have a suit. Don't need one. Alright, well, I guess. Are you a swimmer? Never really get the chance, but I'm pretty good at most physical stuff. Just, uh, not much up here. What's the hurry? Uh, I have to clean the house. You clean your own house? Gives me something to do in between auditions. What's your husband think? - Of what? - About the acting? He's a producer, so he's super supportive. He gets it. Does that mean he could get you a job? I want to get it on my own. You know, on my own terms. It's better that way. "You want..." Why don't you want me? Why don't you want me? "Why don't you want me?" Hey, Ben. Something I can do for you, Mrs. Carlyle? Are you a good handy-man, too? Give it a try. Anything else I can do for you? Actually, yeah. "Why don't you want me?" "Look, I just... " "I wanna know why." "I just... Well, I'm in love with her. I'm sorry." "Why aren't you in love with me?" "That's never what this was about. We were just..." "Just what?" - "Just..." - "Just sex? Is that all this ever was to you?" "I'm sorry. It just wasn't meant to be." "If you walk out that door, you are never coming back." You can press stop. So, what'd you think? Well, I don't know. It's pretty corny if you ask me. Hey, no, I-I mean the script. You were... Yeah, um, I'm gonna get back to... Good work today. Thank you. Keep your damn money, lady. Look, please forgive an actress for being sensitive. It's my job, you know? I'm sorry. You know, I meant that the scene was corny, the words. But not you. You were good. I shouldn't have said that. It doesn't matter. You know, I don't get you. What do you mean? Look, I don't have anything. I mean, I'm a broke, poor loser. You know that, right? And I see your house and your car, and you have everything. But you don't appreciate it. I mean, nothing works. You have all these beautiful things and they aren't being taken care of. You have to take care of beautiful things. Look, I'm a plain working-class guy. And, yeah, I've been to jail. My boss doesn't know that, but there it is. You could get me fired if you wanted to. And you could judge me like everybody else does. But people don't see me. They don't see that I'm a... I'm a stand-up guy. That I'm the type of guy that you should call when you're in a jam. I'm good with my hands. I can make up rhymes that make people happy. You know, I'm worth something. You know, people don't see that. You ever feel that way? You have no idea what it means to a guy like me to take a dip in a private pool. Hey, were you sleeping? No, just napping. Oh, is everything alright? - Yeah, I just had a dream. - Oh, bad? I dreamed the pool got so hot, all the water boiled away. You want me to... you want me to turn off the heater? No. - Ohh, what are you doing? - Take off your clothes. Babe, no, no, no, I got reservations. - How come? - We're cheersing. Babe, you didn't have to do that, I mean, it's just an online... I booked the actor. Yeah, it was just a meeting. Anyway, I... he wants me to fly out to San Francisco. - When? - Tomorrow. - For how long? - Just for the day. Did I ever tell you what happened to Jorge? Who? The gardener. No. They said that he was detained. - Like he was late? - No, like he's in custody. Oh. ICE? God, wait, do you think? No, do we have any extra ice? Oh, yeah, um, there's some in the ice bucket. You know, I think that you should do something, because... I don't think it's a good idea to get involved, babe. I mean, you don't know this guy. Yes, I do. I'm here with him all day. He's a very sweet man. But you don't really. You could be vouching for a criminal, you know? I think it's best if you just drop it, babe. So, what are you gonna do? - Drop it, I guess. - No, about the lawn. Oh, they hired a new guy already. Huh? How is he? Where are you going? I left the pool light on. I can turn in off. No, I'm already up. Hey! Excuse me? Hey! Hey, you left your side door open. Who's up there? No one should be up there. Hey, Ed! Turn that down, man! That's, uh, that's Ed Hogate. I met him yesterday. He just bought the Anderson's place. Oh, really? Yeah, he saw me working and asked me to do some handy work for him. I think he said maybe he met your husband. Oh, Richard left for San Francisco. Oh, well, business? You know, I didn't think that you were scheduled for today. Yeah, I'm not, but I thought maybe you'd, uh... maybe you'd let me take you out to get some brunch or something like that. To thank you for the job and just for being so nice to me. Ben... I don't even know what brunch means. Why don't I just cook us up a couple of burgers instead? Oh, don't go through any trouble for me. Oh, no, please don't worry about it. Okay. Go invite Ed. I want to meet my new neighbor. Okay. Mrs. Carlyle, let me introduce you to Ed. Oh, please, you can call me Kathryn. - How are you, Ed? - Hi. Uh, have a seat. Oh, and um, how do you want your burger cooked? On the grill is fine. Well, uh, eat please. Oh, I used lemon dressing. You know, I'm trying to lose weight, so everyone has to suffer. Come on, you're in great shape. Mmm, yeah, where could you lose it from? Oh, you both are being very nice. So, how'd you end up, uh, buying the Anderson's place? I work at Silicon Valley. That's where I made all my money, so I thought I'd come down here and give old Hollyweird a try. Look, here's my card. "Zzzombi. Product manager". Yes, you see, I'm in charge of the product team. They're the ones who build the applications. A bunch of degenerates and thieves, if you ask me, but they're the ones who get advertisers to buy space on the app, which is all about sleep technology. Z, Z, Z, "Zzzombi." "Sleep like the dead." Hmm. So, I'm the one that's pulling all the strings from the top. You gotta keep them separate, the groups. There's the snakes, and the rats and the birds, and... So, if you wanna download the app, I can give you a 15% discount. Sure, Ed. Thank you. Um, are you guys ready for your burgers? You're the hostess. Thought maybe you could use some help. Oh, yeah, um, can you get the butter? - In here? Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, why don't you let me do that? I was a diner cook up in Fresno. What haven't you done? Where did you first meet your husband? Um, on a movie. Yeah, I-I had one line in a movie he produced. And he asked me out, and I said no, because I didn't want everyone to think... I mean, well, you know what I mean. But he kept asking and then he kept asking after we wrapped, and then that's when I knew that it wasn't just like a silly little thing. Hmm. How long you been married? Oh, a-a long time. You love him? Well, I was 19 and... I mean, yes. Yeah, I'm in love with him. He takes care of you? Well, he's given me everything I've got. But no parts? I don't want him to give me a part. Hm, I'm not sure whether I believe you or not. Well, I said it. And I can speak for myself. Now, if you believed the things I said, we would probably get along a lot better. I watched your short film last night. You did? Yeah, on my phone. I really liked it. You're a great actress. I really thought you were the person you were playing. And, well, uh, you looked really beautiful in it. That was really sweet. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. I, uh, I think you should show it to your husband. Maybe then he'd put you in a... In a movie. - I told you... - But it's none of my business. No, it's not. Okay. Those look really good. Yeah, um, actually, can you take care of this? The grill's just outside. I'm just gonna change, I'll be a couple minutes. I hope you don't mind my raiding your beer but Oates here was thirsty. Oates? Yeah, that's his, uh, his nickname. Where'd you find that? Damn, I was afraid to bend over. Uh, do you play, Oates? Oh, just, uh, "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." I bet you play. I mean, when I was little, you know, my parents had parties. Well, we're having a party. You got any dance music? Um, Alexa, play some dance music. Did you really like my film? I loved it. Is he upset? Well, he's, uh, he's kind of lost. Maybe you should go after him. Do you want me to? I think so. Kind of overstayed my welcome. Yeah, it's getting late. What time do you have to go? Richard lands at 8:40. Plenty of time. I have to pick him up. It can't be later than 6:00. Traffic. One for the road? Alright. ♪ I'm living the dream ♪ - No. - ♪ Burn down the stream ♪ I'm too drunk. I'm not gonna be able to drive. ♪ Run all the steam ♪ ♪ I love... ♪ ♪ Got a couple grand ♪ ♪ And that I can't ♪ ♪ Down there in the day ♪ Good morning. Hey. How far to the Sunset Strip? About 40 miles. You got any water? In the store. I look like I got a dollar to spare? If you aren't gonna buy anything, don't waste my time. Would you rather we just take it? And trash your shithole store instead? Guys, I don't want any trouble. Oates, why don't you go inside and grab us a couple of bottles of water, a couple beers, and a pack of my favorite cigarettes. You think I care about going to jail? Not thirsty. We'll be out of cash soon, so we need to find something. I think I got one. Her? You wouldn't know what to do with her? Sure like to try and figure it out. A good way to get killed. Got a rich daddy at home with an elephant gun. No, she's all by her lonesome. Daddy is out working. Maybe you're right. Let's find out. Fill her up. Regular. Right away. Excuse me, sir. I just gotta say she's a beaut. What year is she? This here is a 1971 Buick Electra. All of it's mine. It's a '70. You say so. Well, how could you not know? I won it in a card game. Hey, you're not headed to Beverly Hills, are you? Matter of fact, I am. I'm on my way to Beverly Hills Hotel. Are you kidding me? Hey, I'm going the same way. Only, uh, my car broke down. I managed to make it to the station, but, uh, I'ma have to leave her here overnight. Oh, that's too bad. What do you got going in Beverly Hills? I'm a musician. See, I've got a big meeting with some bigwigs in them big hills. See, I'm a star, just, uh, nobody knows it yet. Bet you are. Hey, I'm sorry to be rude, let me introduce ourselves. My name is Arthur Morgan. Good to meet you. And this is my buddy, Leon Davis. I'm Ed Hogate. Got a firm policy. Never ever carry any cash on me. It's a good policy. Oh, um, excuse me? Do you know where the 14 South is? - Am I close to the 14 South? - You're close. Yeah, I'm sorry um, my-my GPS isn't working. Alright, Oatesy boy, you get your wish. What do you mean? That one. Uh, she's a little out of your league, don't you think? Here's some advice, free of charge. All things in this world are divided into groups, separated like animals, birds, reptiles. So, you... you wouldn't... You wouldn't breed a snake with a bird, would you? Just wouldn't work. Same exact thing goes for people. Trust me. Do not mix your groups. That's racist, Ed. What? No, no, no, no. I-I-I... Hey, we need a ride, Ed. - We're going the same way. - What? Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second! - Get out of my car! - Better hurry up, Ed. - We're gonna lose her. - What? Get the hell out of my car before I call the police. - What, with this? - Hey! Wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Hogate. Follow her. "Zzzombi". Why do all these tech companies have to spell shit wrong? I have a meeting and I can't be late. Come on, Ed, you can go on a couple of more miles. Thanks for the lift. And, uh, can I tell you something, Ed? That you didn't hear anything, you didn't see anything. It's no skin off your nose. You've got your big meeting this afternoon at the Beverly Hill Hotel, so you won't say anything, will you? No. God, I hope not, Ed. Bye. Think he'll keep quiet? Oh, sure. He's got the situation divided into groups. He knows which one we belong to. So, we go in? Can't just walk in and take whatever we want. Gotta be smooth. Remember last time? Get invited in. Like vampires. Then we'll get the run of the place. What's theirs is ours. Whoa, hey, hey. There's a light on. It's broad daylight. This place is empty. Well, what about the light? Oh. That's just to scare the criminals away. Move over. Think she's gonna go for a swim? Why not? Nobody's watching. That window looks right down on her. Mm... Let's-let's just go. Hold on. I got an idea. What are you doing? Shut up. Hello. I'd like to report an illegal alien in my neighborhood. Richard Carlyle, 2375 Nightingale Place, Los Angeles, California 90046. Well, that's where he was last. Well, he was harassing my daughter and he flashed a gun at me. Look, he has gang tattoos, okay, I can tell. I'm a lawyer. Well-well, hurry up. She naked? No. She's kicking her stupid feet. Quit kicking your stupid feet, you bitch idiot. I can't believe it! It worked, man. It worked! What... Duke, what was the point of that? Why'd you do that to him? Because she's gonna need a new gardener. And you're looking at him. LA Blooms Gardening, this is Javier Del Toro. Mr. Del Toro, are you the manager of LA Blooms Gardening? Yes, what can I do for you? Tell her you're Javier Del Toro. Her gardener's gone. Mrs. Carlyle, alright? Use an accent. Hello? Hello. Is this Mrs. Carlyle? Yeah, this is she. Hello, Mrs. Carlyle, I am Javier Del Toro from LA Bloom Gardening. Yeah, funny you called actually. Um, my gardener, Jorge Torres, he was supposed to come... Yes, I-I would like to inform you that your gardener, Jorge Torres, no longer works for the company. You're supposed to do that into a woman, not your hand. What? What does that mean? Save some jizz for her. Hey, don't talk to me like that. I-I told you, I'm... I wasn't doing anything. Shut up. Where are you going? I'm going to say hi. What do you think? I'm Ben... Saunders. That sound White? White gardener extraordinaire. It's all a game, Oates. The whole world. Only suckers choose not to play, suckers who don't know they're in one. I would say that you can start, but you don't really have any of your tools? Oh, no. I'm not supposed to start until tomorrow. Oh. Yeah, they-they didn't tell me that. I'm sorry. Yeah, they just wanted me to get a feel for the place today and I'll be back tomorrow with everything I need. Alright. What-what happened? She told me about the whole neighborhood. We've moved into the Anderson's. After they moved out. And how'd she look? Smooth. Mm. Is that her boyfriend? Husband. Richard. How do you know? Because of the mail. Because he's a big fat square dickless faggot like you. She's done with him, except for the house and the car. How can you tell that from here? You learn to read the signs. You see the way she crossed her legs? Like she never even met him. Shit! Where'd you learn to cook? I was a short-order cook in Fresno. Did that before you found me in that place. I don't know how I ended up in that bar. I know why you were there, but me, I was just exploring. I was supposed to meet a record exec there, but he wanted me to suck his dick. And I ain't into that fag shit. Well... you saved me. I don't know if saved is the right word, you seemed to be enjoying yourself well enough. - They make you act like that. - Who makes you? Eh... well, you-you killed him. What, that little twink? Why he couldn't make a songbird... Yeah, but they made me. - I told you that. - Alright, Oates. I wouldn't do anything like that... Alright. Goddamn. You know, just one time, I'd like to have a... A decent meal. You know, a fancy dinner. White table cloth. You know, good wine, candles. And those two over there, they get that every night. And they don't appreciate it. You know what I wanna do? What? I want to sit in that white convertible. Yeah, we-we-we could take it out for a spin. I know this guy, we could sell it to him. We could get out of this place. I mean, it gives me the creeps. We could... We could sell it to him. - We could... - No. No, I just wanna sit in it. See how it feels. Not ready to take anything yet. If they hear us, we bounce. It wouldn't be worth it. You wait here. Well, I wanna go if you're gonna sit in it. Smell that perfume? I can't smell it from over here. Get in, son. We need a truck and some tools. Break in, get the car? No, so I can be a real gardener. It's the whole charade, man. It's working. I just need the optics. Look. What-what is this? I-I-I thought it was a cash job with a girl on the side. And now... you-you're a gardener. I mean, I don't get it. ♪ Ms. Carlyle ♪ ♪ Look at that smile ♪ Look, I'm just finessing it, man. Alright, I'm doing it smooth. When I'm through with her, she'll open up her home safe for us herself, she'll hand over her jewelry. You'll see. But... a-a safe? Yeah, of course, they got a safe. They're rich, aren't they? Full of cash and jewelry, I bet, too. Alright, you just got to be a little patient with me. Let me spend a little bit more time with her. You're lying. You like her. You want her. Oh, fuck her! Man, fuck her tits and her condescension. Fuck her house and her acting career! If I wanted her, I could have taken her in the garage. Or on the patio, or I could have pushed her in the fucking pool. - I'm tired. - Hey! - You listen to me, alright. - Stop. You wanna take the place now, all violence and chaos? Huh, you want me to go down there and drag her up by the hair? Tie her up while she kicks and screams? Huh? You want me to cut her, so she bleeds all over you, Oates? You tell me, you wanna leave her dead or alive, 'cause it makes no difference to me. Uh... Alive. Alright. We do it my way... and all the time it takes. Now, go take the truck back. This is a waste of time. Acting like my friend, he's not my friend. I'm tired. So... I watched your film. You were so beautiful in it, and... you are a great actress. I mean, you're really believable, it's... Your film really moved me. What's it like to pretend to be somebody else? They're leaving. You know, you're doing all the work and he's taking her out. You're nowhere, man. She's not gonna sleep tonight. She'll lie awake, think of me. You watch. She's looking up here. Blow her a kiss. No, man. Let her sweat. What are you doing? Just play along. Today's the day. You're Ed. Uh... Ed? Who's up there? I mean, no one should be up there. Hey, Ed! Hey, turn that down, man! You're invited to lunch. You bought this house. We met yesterday, and you asked me to help to fix it up. Alright, you're in the tech business. Come on, man. This-this is... - "Zzzombi." - Yeah. That's your card. Your name is Ed Hogate. Mrs. Carlyle, let me introduce you to Ed. Oh... I knew it. You were just after her all along. Then where's the safe? Let's get this over with. There's no safe, you idiot. There never was a safe. Look, we're here for her. I'll give you first crack at her if you stop fucking this up. I don't wanna go in there. It's okay. You don't wanna be sick, right? No, I'm... I really don't want to go in there. It's okay. It's okay, I got you. I can't. Yeah, chill. Here you go. Here you go. It's okay. This is our bed. We can somewhere else. - We can go next door. - Hmm? I, uh, I need to tell you something first. About Oates. What? He, uh, he doesn't really work in Silicon Valley. I know. He didn't buy the Anderson's place. He's squatting. He told me not to rat. He asked me to help him. He wants something that doesn't belong to him. What? You. That's why he stormed off, you see? I wouldn't let him do it, Kathryn. I wouldn't let him hurt you. Do you know why... Kathryn? It's because I'm in love with you. We're somewhere else. We're here. No. Take her. Quit moving or I'm gonna cut your fucking head off! I can't. Don't tell him I couldn't do it! How could you? How could you? Duke, don't! Don't hit her. Don't... Duke! Duke! Alright, Duke, I can't... I can't... I can't move. Help! I'm sorry! I'm sorry I couldn't do it. I'm sorry! 911, what is the location... I... Help! Kathryn! Duke, she's here! She's here, Duke! - Please, be quiet. - Duke, she's here! She's here, Duke! - Shut up! - Duke! Duke! Kathryn! Richard! Please, help me. Run. Kat... Kathryn? You alright? I wasn't... but I am now. Let's forget what happened. It's in the past. Let's try to be better together, alright? I love you, do you know that? Do you love me, too? And cut! Alright, everybody gather around. Everybody on set, please. Can I have your attention? That's a picture wrap for Kathryn Carlyle.
