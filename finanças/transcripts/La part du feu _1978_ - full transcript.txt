NO PARKING IN FRONT OF THIS DOOR Catherine, do you know what time it is? I don't care! His flight lands in 35 minutes. But you can stay if you want. No. I have to go too. To Orly with me? So he'll see us together? No, at home. I need to prepare stuff. Is it a big night? Not really, but you know Bob. Come on! Who'll be there? The usual mafia. The congressman of all trades, De Warnier, the ladies? Where's your lighter? On the table in the next room. Jacket or tuxedo? While you're at it, can you give me the ashtray, please? Tuxedo? Jacket. Don't look so worried. I took an earlier flight. Sorry you had to rush for me. What are you doing here? I saved you a fine, I paid for your parking ticket. You're going to catch a cold. Go get dressed. Is it your cat? It keeps me company. Well? are you ready? -Yes. -Let's go then. -Where to? -You'll see. Let's not wait for Catherine. Come on. Where are you taking me? To the office. It's the wrong direction. You think? Scared of getting your shoes dirty? I've wanted to go up there with you for a while. You know the rules. In case you want to jump off. I don't want trouble. I thought we were going to the office. Come on. I'd rather wait for you here. What's wrong? Nothing. Come on. Remember when we first met? There was a garden here. Depending on if we could build on it or not, it was worth a fortune or nothing. You know I've never seen the site. No. I'm asking you if you remember the first time I knocked on your office door at the prefecture? Door C, stairs 4, I believe. I remember very well. -Me too. -Do you regret it? No. But that doesn't mean I'm proud of it. Move on! What was I asking you? A planning certificate informing me, unfortunately, that this plot of land would be a no-building area. We couldn't stack any more bricks! Obviously. People make mistakes. It's a change from these civil servants who grant building permits left and right. You turned me down, it's not as bad. -Except for the guy who sold you the land. -He's dead anyway. Make up your mind. You're not too scared? I don't like heights, that's all. What are you getting at? Be patient. How did the guy die? Who? The one that grew cabbage, right underneath us. I don't know. He died of anger when he learned the truth. Do you think about it sometimes? As little as possible. You're wrong. We need to know where we come from. That's the cost of success. I know what I owe you. Not with me. Keep the good sentiments for? those swarming down there. The worms. Normal people. Come on. Come here. It's quite impressive, right? -We can talk it over if you want. -What's up with you? No, buddy! You like Catherine, congrats! I'd rather it be you. I assure you, sex affairs here? Why'd you make me come here? You said we were going to the office. We're in the office. Almost. Once the main tower's done, it'll be fast. We'll relocate in six months. Admit that the climbing was worth it. Six o'clock. We have to come down. You have a lighter? Oh! That was a close one! I want it back! What if I asked you to come and pick it up? I'm leaving, buddy. I started out just like you! Get over it. This kind of guy has no fear of heights. He walks in the air like you on a sidewalk. He is lucky. You have too much imagination. That's how you fall. Let's go, the power's about to be cut. Wait a second. Take one last look. To get this far in life, all means are good. Any means. You understand? -Not really. -Yes, you do. Since I've known you, you've had that flaw. You don't think things through and you believe regret is enough. It must be part of your charm. I'm not against black people, but they have a distinct smell. It's true? Have you noticed? I lack a bit of experience. I have only had Bretons. You're lucky. Anyway? I gave her eight days off, it was no longer bearable. Was it that bad? Did you see that L'Instant published the last article of its series on the racetracks' scandals? You're reading this rag? Only at the hairdresser, my dear. No, thank you. He's going there once a week so he doesn't miss one issue, our banker. I inform myself. If we can call it that? That Delbaut writes nothing but lies, he has no respect. Neither the authorities nor money? Not even the working class. No, thanks. Where's the world going? Forthcoming issues will be dedicated to real estate. I've been told. Let them come. That'd be a bit rich after all you've done. We could do without it. This paper should be banned. That's not very democratic. If this goes on, they'll eventually put us off financing social housing. I've always said so. You give these people comfort, bathrooms and heating, and they'll vote communist! When you think about it, it's true, they're ungrateful. Well, let's move on to? Honey? Why did you leave together? -When? -Earlier, from your place. -He wanted to go to the site. -What did he say to you? Nothing. Honey, instead of monopolizing him, go and offer some cigars to William. -Of course. -Thank you. Try to calm her down. Oh, they're my favorites! You spare no expense. -I bought them in Geneva just for you. -Yes, this afternoon. -That's very kind of you. -Here. No, thank you. I smoke too much. Bob is a prince. You make a wish and it comes true the same day. I'm paid to know that. Look at my pin, it's beautiful! -Bob gave it to me-- -For your birthday. Not at all! When ?douard granted you the exemption. She's talking nonsense. You'd better powder your nose. -Am I shining? -No, but that might happen. Congressman is wanted on the telephone. In my office, let me show you the way. -Gisou, you want to play bridge? -With pleasure! Take my seat, I'm not playing. -Should I pick it up? -No. Sign this. That's why you went to Geneva? Yes. It's none of William's business. Here you go. -What is it? -Your money. It's the bank receipt for when I deposited the money on your account. -That's the amount we agreed on, right? -Yes. I'll need two signatures. Is it necessary? Listen, ?douard. Encrypted accounts are convenient. Swiss banks are discreet. They disregard your name. But if you want to withdraw money, they need a sample of your signature. Yours is illegible. Fear no indiscretion. Here. Yes. Another here. It's the full power of attorney your wife will have to date when you die. -Charming. -It's necessary. Make sure she doesn't thank me publicly. I'll tell Jacques to bring this to the bank tomorrow. You've never set foot in Geneva. -Is that wise? -What? -Do you trust this man? -Absolutely. As myself. -Honey, where did you put the cigars? -On the table. ?douard, do you mind me taking Gisou to the opera tomorrow? -Did we have plans? -No. Okay, then. Did Bob tell you about the Faubourg St-Honor? site? No. Really? Good, I've thought about it. If you're capable of getting the necessary exemptions, we could dispense with him. We'll talk about it. Bob, we need a fourth player. Ask Jacques. My friends need a third player. William, could you bring my scarf? -I'm a bit cold. -Of course, honey. What are you two plotting? -We were rebuilding the world. -Big work. Be sure to keep me posted. You're not too tired? Huh? Are you tired? Bob? Yes? Come here. Where did you go with Jacques? -Didn't he tell you? -No. -You didn't let him. -To the site. What did you tell him? Nothing you'd be interested in. Are you going to fire him? No way! Of course not! I care about him too. What difference would it make? Don't make this hard for us. -You're up early. -I'm leaving. -That early? -I'm leaving, Bob. Ah? Everything was going too well. It's amazing how women like to be so dramatic. Coming back to your place? Yes, in Maurepas. Then? Alone? Yes. After all? that's your business. I have to go. Think it through, Catherine. You'll realize nothing has changed. Only now you know that I know. So what? -Hello? -It's me. What time is it? I wanted to tell you that I'm leaving Bob. What? I need to see you. -When? -Right now. What happened? Everything was fine last night. I love you. That's all. That's no reason. What's all this about? Did he tell you something you don't want to tell me? No! I'm afraid, that's all. Afraid of what? His composure! You wish he had kicked my ass? Yes. Stop dramatizing. Okay? You're reasonable. Your husband is decent, so? So we should try to be the same. Don't you agree? If you had to use it against him, it wouldn't be good for you either. At least the people didn't elect me. In the public eye, it's just another wheeler-dealer realty developer. It's different for a congressman? My name's not mentioned anywhere. You can read. I have no secrets. One, two, three? -Here you go. -One, two, three. Keep those. What about this? Better safe than sorry. So this? Make a file of it. Then go and drop it off in the safe in Maurepas. Maurepas? Yes, everyone knows the combination to the safe here, even my secretary. All right. Here's the key for the safe there. In the living room, under Picasso's drawing, there's a cabinet. It's a safe. The combination is 9-7-3-0. -I'll write it down. -No need. It's the painting's date. July 9, 1930. Nine, seven in roman numbers, three, zero. Here. Don't hurry back tomorrow. You can spend the day there. You can sleep there. You're pale, what's wrong? -Are you worried? -No, I'm okay. It will pass. Until you go to Geneva, the original? In the remaining pocket. There you go! Firmin, please. I'm leaving my car here, if it's in the way, move it. -Hello, Marie. -Hello. I don't know if he's here. -Don't you worry. -Let me announce you. Robert Hansen! We have to announce ourselves now? -What are you doing here? -And you? Are you rebuilding the world? Where to? Tell me, I might be interested. La D?fense? The Champs-Elys?es? No, there's no square meter left. I bet it's Faubourg St-Honor?. You're drunk. No, just in a good mood. It's quite similar. I just happened to be nearby? Comtes de Champagne, you spare no expense. I thought, "Poor ?douard's alone, Gisou's at the opera." -Have you had dinner? -No. But seeing you together makes me really hungry. Jacques? I heard the dog barking. Oh, that's wonderful! I must be hideous, I was sleeping and I heard the dog. I already said that. I'm going senile. Kiss me. Oh, Jacques? Let's not stay here. You're right, we should go. No, Catherine. No, I meant that you'll catch a cold. Oh? right? It's rather chilly. Did you find the house okay? I've been here before. Yes. Jacques? How did you know I was here? I didn't even know you left Paris. And why are you here? I need to put something into the safe. Can you turn on the light? You know the combination? -You don't? -No. I thought it was your house. Yes, but he bought the safe. I don't know the code. -It's right in front of you. -What? Nothing. What are these papers? I don't know. You haven't read them? No. You came just for this? Yes. If he had told you, would you have come? No. Don't ask me if you can't handle the truth. Don't twist my words. I needed time to think, to see a little clearer. You understand? -I'm exhausted. -If only that was all. -What? -Nothing. Are you hungry? No, I ate on the road. Thank you. Come on. Come. Jacques wants to destroy us. With a smile, casually, it's his style. And he's getting his way! You think I don't see I'm annoying you? -No! -That's all you have to say? Catherine! -Can't you see I'm a wreck? -So am I! I'm also a nervous wreck! So? if I understand correctly, it's always all about you, isn't it? Am I right? You! When you're done talking, you want to make love. I don't want that. Because I exist? too! Yes, me! You might not be interested, but there's the rest of me! The rest is what matters. Calm down. Right, I should calm down, do nothing and forget about it? I got free room and board! No, thank you. Even though you're born rich, I'm not interested! You see? I'm like your husband. What gets me hard is his business. He's been on the case of a site in Faubourg St-Honor? for three months. 5 000 meters. Sounds familiar? It's a struggle, but we'll get it! -And you want me to give up! -No, Jacques. No. I just needed an explanation. -Get some rest? -Leave me alone! Where's this site exactly? Aren't you going to bed? Answer me. You won't be interested. If you don't want to tell me? It's near Herm?s. There you go. Are you happy now? It depends. On what? Try to trust me a bit more. Good night. -Aren't you coming? -Later. I'm not sleepy anymore. I'll be sleeping. I hope so. Honey? Where is Jacques? It's you. -Good morning anyway. -Good morning. Where is Jacques? He must be sleeping. No. Have you looked in his bedroom? Which bedroom? The guest bedroom. I told you. Rise and shine! You're not talkative. -I haven't really woken up yet. -What do you want us to say? Isn't this nice? The weather is good. There's no hurry. Why always choose in life, when we don't have to? Preferring one to another is losing one anyway. I don't like losing. On these words of wisdom, I'm going to visit our people. -Is the garden maintained? -I think so. You need to leave, and fast! Why? I don't know what he's up to, but you can't stay. After all, maybe he really doesn't care. About what? Well? You, me. The forgiving husband? It's not his type. Listen, Catherine. You think it's normal he asked you to come here? Yes. And the way he talked with his rifle in the morning? No. I don't know. You're not going to keep her tied up? -She does a lot of damage! -She's young, she can be trained. I should lock up my hens. If she eats one, I'll pay for it. Jacques! -Where are you going? -Home. I don't belong in here. Don't be silly. We need to have a serious talk. Come on. Aren't you leaving? No, we have to talk. It's true. You should have seen his face. Whose face? -You wouldn't understand. -I'd like to laugh too. ?douard. You don't believe us? People never believe me. Come here! Scavenger! Come here, I'm telling you! Heel! Bring it back! If I catch you? Come back here! Heel! -Give me this hen! -Don't scream at her. Okay? No, don't be afraid. There you go. Put it in a sacking. -The hen? -Really tight. A bulge? like a necklace around her neck. Easy. Don't worry, girl. You'll get your hen. -Catherine's not here? -She's getting dressed. You're here? That modesty is new. When was the last time we made love? Don't. You're embarrassing me. It's more serious than I thought. Yes. Sir? I hate that he calls me sir. Come on up! -Sorry. -No, come in. Come in. Help her. She can't stand being naked in front of us. Help her. My poor Bob. What you might think or not? Jacques! You're not going to sulk? I've had enough. I'm leaving. Of course. You're too much for me. Both of you. I'm going to Paris. No way. Yes, I am. Precisely. I don't take refusal well, you should know that. Is he gone? Yes, he left. I'll also have to leave soon. You plan on catching up with him? -Are you going to stay here long? -I don't know yet. -Thank you anyway. -For what? I learned something amusing. Really? You're jealous, Bob. -Of you? -No. Of Jacques. Ah? You're right. But not anymore. Though I have been, I can't deny it. The day I realized he had a mistress. I mean, someone. Not casual encounters. He was leaving the office earlier without saying where he was going, so I was jealous. Like all jealous men, I tried to find out. And it happened to be you. Then it becomes curious. Because it was a relief. First, I was surprised, like you right now. Then, I was relieved. Don't forget to give the rabbit to the janitor. Swiss Air flight 723 bound for Geneva, check-in counter is closed. Boarding's in ten minutes, gate 36. Have a safe trip. Are you the last ones? You can shut it off! I'm sorry we can't go up there. We can't even work with the wind. Some other time. Preferably when the carpeting is laid. -Not this way. -I'll figure it out. I'll show you out. You still haven't given me an answer. The option's tomorrow. Yes, I know, but this matter is really delicate, my dear friend. Of course, the current building isn't listed, so in theory, we can take it down, but the Faubourg St-Honor? isn't La D?fense. ?douard provided us with enough guarantees. Oh! You know ?douard's exemptions? Still! Without him, it's not 30 floors we could have built, but only eight. Huge difference! Yes, but regarding the Faubourg, you'd be wrong to count on ?douard. For God's sake, what an idiot! What's he doing up there? I'm not going to get him, he does that all the time. I bet he has no harness! Oh! Oh! Oh! Listen to me, goddamn it! Get down immediately! -Was he married? -Yes. Get me his wife's address. Have you thought about it? Good God! About what? Life and death? And our matter, obviously. How can you, at a moment like this? I can. You can too. So? No. May I? Perfect. Go by yourself. It's beyond my strength. We have duties. This man was my friend. You'll make me cry. I don't ask you much. Just sniff, it'll be enough. Often I came up there to talk with him. Only yesterday, I? Yes, he told me. Excuse me. He was a really good man, really brave. -Maybe too brave. -No, thank you. -Do you want some? -No, thanks. My Pierrot? My Pierrot? You haven't finished? No, there's too much. She gets emotional. She just came to kiss you. Right, Catherine? You are very kind. To deal with urgent matters. Oh? It's really nice of you. Thank you, I'm very touched. Money's not much when you lost everything. I feel your pain, ma'am. I must admit I have my share too. Thank you. Pierrot was a friend. Don't you forget that. -Can I walk you out? -There's no need. Emotional stuff makes me hungry. You want to get some dinner? No, thanks. You asked me to come with you to see that poor woman and I did. Now, don't count on me anymore. You returned to the marital home. I came back to Paris because I had stuff to do. You wanted to be with Jacques. So what? Have I ever stopped you? In fact, you'll see him right now. He's not in Paris. He's back, I'm telling you. We're on our way to meet him. We're late. You invited him to dinner? Surprised? Did he accept? Not the first time! You're the boss, right? Here's how I learned that ?douard and William were playing a dirty trick on me. That was predictable. Those two are hypocrites. I'm not surprised. When there are three people in one business, like the three of us at this table, it's not unusual for two of them to spin the perfect love hiding from the third. -You want some? -No, thanks. Yes. You'll get married this year. That's where I'm at. Either I let myself get eliminated, or I take control of the operations. I get in trouble the one who tried to get me in trouble. You said we shouldn't choose in life. It's best to avoid it. But sometimes, we have to take sides. Burn a neighborhood to save a city. Or set fire to a wood to spare a forest. This method proved its worth. So, in your opinion, which of these gentlemen? -Am I boring you? -Not at all. For my part, I've made my choice. Speaking of fire, honey, please? What are you waiting for? She asked so nicely. Here's Delbaut. I figured it was your car I saw. -Do you know that despicable man? -I don't think so. Good point for you, ma'am. Unfortunately, I can't give one to your husband. -Patrick Delbaut. -Ah, it's you! He's charming. Don't say it too often, it could bring L'Instant circulation down. What's new? You know it as well as I do. The little accident you had earlier? That poor soul who fell. Is that it? You don't seem interested. Me? The readers are the ones who matter, not me. What people care about is the cost of life, the price of steaks, that of the congressman. It gives you an idea of who he is. It's like toadstools, you have to know them to avoid them. You know my partner, Jacques Noblet. Ask Catherine to dance with you. What were you doing in Geneva? Some stuff for the company. It's not important. You could have told me. I thought he had told you. You have to make up your mind. There's no rush. His demonstration wasn't clear enough? Yours too, by the way. Calling me "honey" in front of him. It was about making a choice. I'm waiting for yours. What are you talking about? It was just about a business. You should trust me, Jacques. When will you understand that I can't leave him? -I don't want to! -I know that! -So stop it. -Calm down. Give me until tomorrow. Let's be serious. Your dear congressman didn't stick his neck out just for you. ?douard's my friend, that's enough. How much did this valuable friendship cost you? You are disgusting. It's a matter of habit. I'll never get used to it. Excuse me. May I? What's up with you? Maybe you haven't noticed, but I was dancing. He will easily find another one. Shall we go home? I've had too much to drink. I don't want to leave Jacques with this guy. Come on. -Are you coming for a drink? -No, I'm tired. While we call a taxi, come on. Come here, Catherine. Sit down. No, I'd rather stand, thank you. Do you want to dance? I interrupted you two earlier. No. But Catherine wants to. Am I right, Catherine? Go ahead. I'm telling you! You want to? Why not. What are you doing? It's better, isn't it? Good night. I'll take you home. HALT! TO THE INSANE RENTAL RATES Let's see. Interesting, isn't it? Indeed. Question. Why are you doing this? I have my reasons. -That don't concern me. -Exactly. Well, it's perfect. Right. If I want that to be printed today, I need to take care of it now. Get me the workshop. Do you mind? I was leaving. You know the way. -Goodbye. -See you soon and thank you. When I'm done with the printer's, get me ?douard Moureu. Yes, the congressman. Gaston? We're changing the front page. Erase it all, we're starting over. Hello, Flora. Hello, ma'am. Can you tell my husband I'm here? He's still on the site. Oh, right, I forgot! It's okay, we don't need him. I need to put this in the safe, I'm going on a trip later. With all these burglaries, I've stopped living. I'll let you do it, you know the combination. Heck! It always happens at a bad time. -Have you got a needle and thread? -Of this color, I'm not sure. With that button, it won't show. I'll sew it up. No, you have work to do! Bring me the kit, I'll do it. Thank you. Don't worry. I'll put it inside and close it. What did he tell you? He wanted me over to the newspaper. Immediately. Is that all? Before I could ask anything, he had already hung up. It's pretty clear he's trying to gather intel. He tried it on me vainly. Did you see him? Yesterday. You told him about me? Of course, you're my friend, it's not a flaw. As to our agreements, no one knows about them. No. I mean, yes? William. You told him? I mean? I think so. It was a mistake. -Have you seen the time? -I overslept. -Is Mr. Hansen here? -Not yet, but his wife is. -His wife? -Yes. She came to put her jewelry in the safe. She's been sewing up a button for 25 minutes. -A button? -You should go and see. I dare not disturb her. What are you doing here? You can see I'm waiting for Bob. What about you? Me too. The secretary told me you were here. So, where does that leave us? Have you thought about it? Yes. Really? It was about time. -Hello, Flora. Is Mr. Noblet here? -Yes. -Send him in. -He's in your office with Mrs. Hansen. You don't often give me this pleasure. I'm here to say goodbye. Who says it's not what I'm hoping for? Stay. It's too good. This harrowing scene couldn't wait till tonight? I brought you the necklace you gave me. The diamond necklace? At this point? It's our dearest memory. I know that you're over it. It's in the safe. -Who opened it for you? -Your secretary. What are you going to tell her? My employees only take orders from me. Could you come in, please? Sir? Who authorized you to open this safe? -I meant well. -Of course, I asked her! I was happy with you but find another job. -But I? -I'm sorry. You're horrible. Horrible? You hear that? What do you think? What do you think? Don't stand here like a fool. You're dying for it. -Aren't you running after him? -There's no rush. For now, I delight. Enjoy. It's clear they want to dishonor me. Through me, they want to sully France. I won't put up with it. Who gave you these papers? If I had known, I wouldn't have called you. -Someone gave them to you. -No. I found them on my desk. Without any explanation? Nothing. Hence my suspicion. Not to mention the basic propriety that wants me to warn you. You did the right thing. Let me tell you, my friend, that these are obvious forgeries. This isn't my signature. Besides, it's illegible. Indeed. Thank you, Gaston. -You're not going to publish this? -No. It's a rough model we prepared, just in case, to give you an idea. You see here? I see the documents. At the bottom, we wrote a funny sentence. Here, I would see a picture. Not a portrait. But rather something? that identifies you in relation to one of your political activities. Or other. Inconceivable. It's absolutely awful. I think so too. What? I'd find it inconceivable that a man in your position took such risks. -It's not true! I would never have? -And it's a pity. I mean from a journalistic point of view. The readers would have liked it. Well, you know our motto. "One head a week." Very funny. But notice? I mean no harm to anyone. If you really are innocent, I'm more than willing to take an interest in someone else. But who? A developer? A banker? I don't know. Yet you're well placed. You know a lot of people. Less than what they say. That's a shame. I can't put you on the front page, so I'd have expected compensation. You've already taken one just now. Maybe. All that matters is that I've convinced you. You're convinced, right? Absolutely. Should I walk you out? No. Save yourself the trouble. So? Give it to the platemaking. -But you just said? -What? Yes. That he convinced me. I am convinced, my friend. Delbaut asked for a compensation? What? Information on? Do you know something? About who? I don't know. About? De Warnier? Of course, he's a banker. You're not going to do that to William? At this point? Let's not exaggerate. After all, it's just about your honor. Please, don't be sarcastic. Not after you got me in trouble. You have no choice. You have to pay. Blackmailing press doesn't exist, Bob. Maybe it does in America, but not here. Anything can be bought, here as elsewhere. Silence as the rest. It's only a matter of money. You must know that. I believe there's a great flight to Geneva in 45 minutes. And I'm the one who has to fork out, with my money. It's a bit mine too. You earned it, but you have to spend it! Otherwise, where's the fun in that? -Flight 36, you're just in time. -36, thank you. "?between the undersigned Mrs. Dermont, unemployed, born in Le Havre on July 7, 1899, residing in Paris, 214 bis, Faubourg St-Honor?, 8th arrondissement, and Mr. Noblet, Jacques, businessman born in Pontoise on March 15, 1941?" He will have to send me a birth certificate for the drawing up of the final act. Of course. "?residing 16 rue Monsieur, it is agreed that the seller?" It's perfect, counselor. I read faster than you, I'm sorry. Very well. Let me inform you that it seems impossible to get the money on such short notice. It's done. I'm selling Maurepas. Think it through. I've thought about it. We're signing tomorrow. After all, that's your business. But I warned you, Catherine. You shouldn't decide on an impulse. Counselor, you told me the same thing when I first got married. Remember? When I put all I had into my husband's business. As far as I know, I haven't lost anything. Mortgaging is not selling! I must say that your husband has been particularly wise. -You're not picking up? -No, I know who that is. I can't believe your great-grandfather planted all those trees. We can't have it all. By the way, I'd like to ask you 24 hours of absolute discretion. Until we sign the sale agreement. -You can count on me. -Thank you. Yes? Congratulations. What? I said congratulations, well done. Ah. What else? Come on, Bob. Faubourg St-Honor?? It's yours now your wife is buying it. Why deny it? I don't understand. If you wanted to keep it a secret, you should have stopped Catherine from calling the bank and asking for a certified check. She'll pick it up tomorrow morning. And she'll also top up her account. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to surprise you. Catherine? Have you seen my wife? Not since this morning, sir. -She told you when she'll be back? -No, sir. -Nor where she was going, naturally? -Naturally, sir. All I can tell you is that she took a small suitcase with her. An overnight bag, as they say. Will you have dinner? Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty. Fifty? These are Swiss francs. Yes, of course. I can't count in another language. It's not enough? Yes, it is. I dare say that I didn't expect that much. It's very good. So can I count on you? Absolutely. Where's Catherine? I don't know. You can look for her, she's not here. That's more like it. -Were you having dinner? -Me? No. What's this? It's for the cat. After what we agreed on, I'm a little surprised. By what? To see you here. Oh, right, it's true! We fell out. I completely forgot about it. Fortunately, the others believe it. If you had hit softer, it would have been the same. You told me to go right ahead. -I didn't ask that much of you. -Sorry. You can be. Not because of this. You slipped up good. Me? With Delbaut? With Catherine. I haven't seen her since? -In your office-- -Why did you tell her about the site? She's double-crossing us. Where's my client at? Bathing. You can switch the light back on. -Did he kill someone? -What makes you say that? He's got a nice face for a politician. -In fact, he's a victim. -Really? Isabelle, you will write, "Victim of his naivety." Find me some paper. No, wrapping paper. -And a ribbon. -A ribbon? Preferably pink. OF THE PRESS MORE THAN ONE TOWER UP HIS SLEEVE -A package came for you, sir. -Put it here. -Another gift! -What is it? There's a card. Can I open it? I'm so excited! Swiss francs! Bye. -Sir? -L'Instant. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. CONGRESSMAN ?DOUARD MOUREU INVOLVED IN A HUGE SCANDAL He was rushed to the hospital. We hope to be able to give you more information on his health in our upcoming bulletin. MORE THAN ONE TOWER UP HIS SLEEVE I'm here. -Want some coffee? -No. You're not kissing me? -You could have called. Where were you? -In the countryside. -In Maurepas? -Yes. I tried to call three times but there was no answer. I was out. I was really busy. What did you do? It can wait. Here, read that. It's awful. ?douard had a stroke! -A stroke? -Yes. I just heard it on the radio. You understand why I was afraid. Because he did all that. You don't believe me? He is capable of anything. You have nothing to fear anymore. Here. What is it? Your refusal of building permit. The photocopy was in the countryside and the original, in the safe in Paris. Is it fake? Why? My signature couldn't be more authentic and it's the prefecture's letterhead. All of this seems to follow the rules to me. Simply, it's indeed untrue that a ban on building has been applied to plot 112, section B. And you knew that. We can't always choose the means. Did Bob ask you to do that? He didn't have to push me much. What are you doing? That way you won't have to worry. I wish I had never told you. I wanted to burn it. I thought best to do it in front of you. So you feel free. That's nice of you. Although, if I had wanted to, they would have been destroyed long ago. I had many opportunities to take these papers. They're not that compromising. It really wasn't worth all the trouble! What's up with you? What is it? Well? Nothing. Tell me. No. You go first. It sure didn't take you 24 hours for it to end like that. What did you do the whole time? I've thought about us. I was hoping you'd read it at another time. I wanted things to go better. I've been clumsy. I'm so sorry, it's my fault. I should have trusted you more. That's all you have to say? No, but? Let me get used to it. So, just like this, in my name, Faubourg St-Honor?. As a gift? Yes. I wanted it to be a surprise. All you have to do is sign. And that's it? Have you read it? Yes. What's in this for you? Nothing! -You want me to feel free. -Yes. -Completely free. -Exactly! So I'm free to accept or refuse this trifling sum of half a billion. I know. It's rude to talk about the price of a gift. Turns out that I know it. You're wrong, Catherine. I don't spit at money. Don't push me too hard if you want me to be free. But you are. You're right. To get what I want, and if everything goes well, to look a bit like Bob, I don't need you. You're calling him Bob, now. It's his name. Yes. Since you're going to walk in his footsteps, I will have you know that Bob needed me. You? My money, if you like. No, I don't want your money. Proof is: He's the one I need. It can't be true, Jacques. You don't realize what you're saying. You're right, he doesn't realize. Pull yourself together! How are you? It's been a while. What are you doing here? We were waiting for you. Do you mind? It's delicious. A bit cold but very good. As good as his bed. Admit that it was my turn. No, don't worry, he slept on the couch. You and I don't have the same notion of the word possession. Sign it. The money is fully paid to the notary. You hear that? It's a change from cufflinks, golden lighters and other things keeping the gigolo in shape. At least, you dig deep. You just have to sign it. What are you waiting for? Sign it! You saw that? You still have a lot to learn. -Catherine! -I'm here. Already presiding over a board of directors? No. I just needed to put up a front. I don't like losing either. Are you happy? You've got your way? But you haven't won yet, Bob. Why didn't you shoot me right away when I came in? Before talking. It's too late, you won't do it. Ladies and gentlemen, please. My poor sir. Who would have thought? Stay strong. What more can I say? -Stay strong. -I'll try. You'll get through it. I know you, my dear. -My sincere condolences. -Thanks. Gis?le. Why did she do this? I don't know. You think you made her happy, gave her everything, and after? Come on. How's ?douard? I'm feeding him with a spoon. It takes me hours. Everyone turns their backs on me, starting with him. Not that I found him pretty, but still. It's hard. -Should I take you home? -No, thanks. I got my car. -When will you be at work? -After lunch. -Life must go on. -Business too. Very well. Don't forget to call me. Here, sign it. Sign it. I like you. Hello? -Hello, Mr. De Warnier? -Yes? -Jacques Noblet speaking. -Hello, dear friend. Hello. I have a business proposition. -You? -Yes, me. -With Bob? -No. It's just me. Ah. Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. in my office? Tomorrow. Thank you. Bye. You see, Jacques, to get this far, all means are good. You understand? Any means. Subtitle translation by: Lucie Monteau
