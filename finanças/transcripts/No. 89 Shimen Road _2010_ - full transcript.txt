I started taking photos when I was 17, in Shanghai in the Da Zhongli area. They were all plain, black-and-white. But every time I look at these photos, I can hear and smell that old Shanghai. My mother gave me my first camera before she left for the U.S. She wanted me to send her photos. My father didn't need photos because he could see me everyday. Actually it was not my father really, but his portrait looking down at me. Back then, Grandpa would ask me now and then to dust this photo off. Grandpa raised me by himself and taught me how to take pictures. Later he told me that the entire Shikumen building used to belong to our family. But during the Cultural Revolution, our house was confiscated by the state. Soon, some "workers' families" moved in. Xiaoli, what are you doing? Go get my cigarettes! Including Lanmi's family. Lanmi became my best friend. I always took photos of her, but she didn't like it. To this day, I still miss the hectic and crowded life in the Shikumen. I don't know why I miss the people's playful squirmishes and little joys. I took many photos at that time, in order to learn photography. But one day, I lost most of them. Where are the cigarettes? - Cigarettes? Here! Missing one again! - What? That's our rule, I only took one. I can't tell you when that was, because in my country it's still taboo. Lanmi! Can you take a picture of me? Why take a picture so early? My mother says she misses me in America, so she wants my picture. Quick! That year was a turning point for me, a time of mixed emotions, some highly enthralling, others very cruel. Turn the black button on top... Everything came upon me very heavily. Quick. There's no one in the background. I couldn't hide from it, and even faced it with my camera. Did you take these? Yes. Not bad, especially these snapshots. Do you also like photography? Yes. I have a lot of photos at home. I can show you some other time. OK. You don't speak Shanghainese? No, I don't. Which class are you in? I've never seen you before. I just came here, today is my first day. Which school did you come from? I went to school in Beijing. I came here because my dad was redeployed. Beijing? - Yes. That's why you speak perfect Mandarin. Our school needs a radio announcer. I think you should give it a try. Why not... I can give it a try. Talk to teacher Zhang in the Youth League. OK. Who is she? You take a lot of pictures of her. Just a neighbour. I'm back. - Hello. Comrade Jiang, when will you return my paintings? Mr Xiao, we have told you many times... Since we can't find the original pieces we can only give you money instead. I only want my paintings back. And why didn't you redress my son's case? We also talked about this many times. The case is not under our control, nor is the compensation money. We only saw to it because of your overseas relatives, and as the compensation bureau was disbanded. What are you doing here, then? This is not a conversation for a child. I can't sleep at night here. Can't you just control your voice? It sounds like a pig is being killed. Say that one more time! It sounds like a pig is being killed! How dare you beat me! Don't fight. People are listening. What's the matter? Did you fight with your mother again? I really want to leave that damn home. But where to? I don't know. But... America would be the best. How will you get there? Ask your mom to take me there. I don't see what's so great about America. I'd rather stay in China. Why? I want to be China's Bresson. - What? Bresson! - Who? Sounds like a name of some Western pastry. If you don't know it, don't talk nonsense. He's the best photographer in the world. He's French. But you can go to America and be Bresson. I don't want to go to America. I don't understand why you don't wanna go. Believe me, sooner or later you'll go there, you just don't want to go now. Let's wait and see. Xiaoli, are you back? Hi, Aunt Lu. Three cards of three, three cards of four. - Three cards of eight. Cool, cool. - Three aces! - Look at this! What? Do you still dare to sit on it? Sure. Even when he was alive I sat on it! Did you really sit on it? - Of course! After the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai, we sat on Mao's photo. Then your grandpa came... Old Jiao, stop telling the kid this kind of story. Your grandfather is too cautious, but he will never admit it. Xiaoli, here is some money to buy cakes from Victory. I don't know where Victory is! OK. I'll go with you then! Why don't you go there yourself? So you'll find it next time. Let's go, I'll get you your favorite cake. Come with me. Grandpa, did Grandpa Jiao really sit on Mao's photo? What do you think? He was almost tortured to death by red guards because of this during the Cultural Revolution. How did they know? Their maid turned him in. You can see a person's face, but not his heart. Hello, Director Lu. The Communist Party has correctly reviewed all the important historical events since the establishment of the PRC, especially the Cultural Revolution. No doubt that the Cultural Revolution has been completely rejected. And all the wrong cases have been redressed. Every case has been corrected. Xiaoli, what are you talking about? Speak louder, so everybody can hear you! I think what you said isn't true. At least my family's case has not been redressed yet. How come? My grandpa's paintings were confiscated and have not yet been returned. Maybe your grandpa's case was an exception, a particular case that can't speak for the majority. Until the paintings will be returned, our case can't be considered "redressed". I tell you, you've failed your last several exams. You should listen to my lecture carefully instead of making a scene in class. Lanmi? - Director Lu? Are you off work? - Yes. Please bring this bag of pokercards to Manager Ren from Shanghai Hotel. - OK. Xiaoli, I admire you so much. You dare to challenge the teacher. I think he's not right. I won't take his test tomorrow. Good idea. I won't go either. Do you want to see my photos at my house? OK. - Do you have a paper and a pen? Hurry up! This is my home number. Call me tomorrow, OK? You have a private phone? - Yes, so? Excuse me, where can I find manager Ren? Take the lift over there to the second floor. - Thank you very much. Don't clean when guests are here! Why don't you listen to me? Do you want to drive all our guests away? People spend money here to have fun, not to eat the dust! Improve the quality of service, I have repeated it many times. OK, go back to work. Did Director Lu send you with the cards? Yes. Are you manager Ren? - Yes. Here, these are for you. Hey, wait, have a glass of coke before you go. There you go. Wang, bring us two cokes. - OK. What's your name, girl? Li Lanmi. So you don't speak Shanghainese? I don't speak it, but I understand it. I lived in the province of Anhui before I came to Shanghai with my mother. I see. How old are you? 22. What do you do in the factory? I'm just an ordinary worker. Have some cola. Drop! Smash! Good! One minute. Serve! I am tired and need to take a break. Are you going home? - Yes. What is it? You are so mysterious! Wow, coca-cola! Where did you get this? A woman from Hotel Shanghai gave it to me. Cool. What are you doing? Let me get a bottle opener. You have to buy ice first! Why ice? The coke tastes much better with ice. Don't drink it before I come back. In my heart lies hidden a little secret I want to reveal it to you it's not just a common affection but deep inner feelings In my heart lies hidden a little secret I've never spoken of it... What are you doing? Go get a tool to break the ice. Chance brought it about that we met in the breath of a moment I long for you infinitely that's my secret Be careful! - I know. Enough? Yes. Xiaoli, where did you get the cola? Lanmi brought it in. Have you memorized today's English text? Not yet. Why do you play all day long? Why don't you study English? Coke is worth nothing in America. It's like water. You'll drink it daily once you're there. Do you understand that? Have a seat please, teacher Liu. I am going to wake up Xiaoli. Since he's not well, just let him rest. Ok, please sit down. Thank you for coming to see my grandson, teacher Liu. Since he was too sick to take the last test too, I have come to see what's wrong with him. Maybe it's just a coincidence. No. I think he planned it. Well, do you have any evidence? Evidence? No. But he gets sick for every politics class test. That's very strange. If I remember correctly, that only happened twice. Anyway, he can't choose when he gets sick, can he? I don't agree with you. Anyway, education is not only the teacher's responsibility. I have to go now. If you'll excuse me. Xiaoli, if you're not interested in something, you could at least pretend to be. Just pretend! Xiaoli! Why didn't you come by yesterday? I... My grandpa didn't let me out since I was supposed to be sick, so... You should have called me. I am going up now. Wait for me, Xiaoli! How often do you look at yourself a day? It won't make you more beautiful. Lanmi, has your mom left? Yes. Come to my house to use the mirror. Your mirror is bigger, I can look at myself from head to toe. At home, my mother bitches about that. Your mom goes too far indeed. Turn around, I'll try the dress on. I'll show you the letter from my mom. You can read it to me. My mother writes that she's going to marry her American boyfriend. Really? She wants my advice. That's why you don't want to go there. Anyway, it makes me uncomfortable. You're such a child. I would be happy if I were you. The marriage could get both her and you a greencard much faster. How do you know that? A woman from my factory said so once. I am afraid my mom will become as mean as yours after she gets married. At least she'll be a mean American. How is it? What do you think? Isn't this good? You will look better if you get a pair of high heels! - High heels? I didn't think you had a sense of fashion. But where can I find high heeled shoes? My mom probably left some, wait a moment. I don't have the key now. Lanmi, you have a call! - I'm coming! What's up? A woman named Ren from Hotel Shanghai just called and asked you to call back. Hold on, I'll be down in a second. Don't worry, be happy and relax. Just watch. Come on have a cigarette. Is your grandpa in? - No, he's gone. Come on, stop pretending to work so hard. I'm not pretending. Let's listen to Zhangxing's songs. Grandpa will get upset if he sees us. It doesn't matter. ...lies hidden a little secret I want to reveal it to you it's not just a common affection but deep inner feelings In my heart lies hidden a little secret I've never spoken of it it's written in my heart and will become an everlasting memory Chance brought it about that we met in the breath of a moment... Where did you learn that? At the dancehall at Shanghai Hotel. Foreigners wear such a strong perfume. So disgusting. I will take photos of your goofy dancing. I just started learning, stop it. Have you ever taken a bath in Hotel Shanghai? Never. It's so cool. When you immerse in the hot water of the bathtub, it's as if you went straight to heaven. Really? You're exaggerating. No, really! Compared to our wooden bathtub at home it's like day and night. Seriously. You have to try it someday. When will I have a chance to go there? Take me along the next time you go there! Do you really want to come? Dream on! You smell strange. It seems to come from your mouth. Shut up, I just brushed my teeth. You can smell. It's coming from your mouth. What did you brush your teeth with? Wait a second. I used this to brush my teeth. It's all in English. Where did you get it? I found it during a bath in the hotel. What does it say? What's wrong? It's not for teeth... it's for your skin! Here, take it. I found your laundry dried and collected it for you. You are better than my mother. She never collects my laundry for me. Thank you! Can you bring me the Zhang Xing cassette? It's for next Thursday. For what? It's my birthday and I'd like to make a party. - Really? Be quiet! Can I come to the party? Sure, you have to. But don't tell anyone else in this house. I don't want them to know. Understood? Happy Birthday! I can cut it myself. Do you want this piece? Here, take it. Here, it's ready. Help yourselves! What are you doing? Eat some cake. - Wait. Happy birthday. What's this? Open it and see for yourself. High heeled shoes! They're great! Where did you get them? They're my mom's. You're so thoughtful! You already know how to make a girl happy, even though you're still young! Yeah, we never knew that about you! Stop teasing him. Of course he understands his «big sister». Go on and dance. OK, go. Please give me a hand. Why are you so abstracted, grab the camera at your house and take some pictures! Why didn't you return with your camera? I had no film left. You could have come back. Just to sit around? I prefer going to sleep. There were so many girls to dance with. I'm not as popular as you! What's wrong? Are you angry? - Stop it! Does Li Lanmi live here? Yes. What do you want from her? She has been away on a sick leave for a long time, the factory union sent me. Sick leave? Could it be a mistake? She goes to work every day and never took a day of sick leave. A mistake? I am the director. Director Lu? Pick it up! It's not mine. You've been fired from the factory. You eat free rice at home, so you need to do more housework! Why playing sick? Of course they'll find out! Alright, stop it! You couldn't keep your mouth shut! Who are you calling stupid? Have you paid your rice money? Today you have to wash the diapers. What are you doing? Xiaoli, do you have 20 yuan on you? Yes. - Lend it to me. Is this enough!? Lanmi, do you want me to collect your laundry? Will you do me a favor? What? Can you send my picture to your mom and ask her to find me a husband in America? What a crazy idea. Have you really been fired? If you really need money, I can lend you some. I'll help you out until you find a new job. You're a student, where can you find that kind of money? My mom sends me money every month. I've saved all of it. What if I never find a new job? I will help you anyway. Now that's a crazy idea. I don't understand why you'd want my mom's help but not mine. Lanmi, where are you going? To work. Have you found a job so quickly? The woman from Hotel Shanghai helped me. Why don't you ride your bicycle to work? It's inconvenient for me in this skirt. Listen, the light is good now. Let me take a picture of you. Stop it. Another time, I have to go now. How much does the television cost? 2000 yuan. You are rich to be able to afford that! Xiaoli's mother sent us the money. Here it comes. They're students. They're not here to promote democracy. Why are you watching that? You don't have to be so thrilled! They only intend to disturb law and order disguised as a democratic movement. Their purpose is to cause havoc in our stable political environment. This is a conspiracy. It's a revolt. Hey, let me tell you something. Mr Yang says, Lanmi sleeps with foreigners at the hotel. That's enough! Was Mr Yang there? How does he know that? Don't talk bad behind other people's back. Well well, are you threatening me? Little boy, what's your connection to her? Why do you care about her so much? Mr Yang, can you tell me how you know that Lanmi is escorting foreigners? The street sweeper saw her getting out of a foreigner's car at dawn. They kissed each other goodbye. Did you hear that, little boy? That's why they can afford all the good food. Let's see what they're cooking today! Yum yum, a pork knuckle... ...and a duck! Mama Li, your pot is boiling up. I'm coming. Can you turn down the gas for me? Of course. Xiaoli, what are you doing here? Was that you who just flashed me? Say something! Are you crazy? You're nuts! What do you want? Move away! Don't you want a picture of yourself to send to my mom? This is the last photo I took of Lanmi. After that, I almost gave up photography. But in reality I took several more photos at that time. And these photos almost got me into trouble. Grammar school Nr. 58 Xiaoli, just wait for me for a second. Today's campus radio program has come to an end. Thank you for listening. Xiaoli, what are you doing? You're really obscene. That's non of your business. Xiaoli, are you OK? Is something wrong? A little. Can I know what happened? Nothing. Listen, Xiaoli, how about that: You haven't seen my photos yet. Would you like to come to my house to see them now? This way? Here. Go ahead. Your family has such a big house? - Yeah. It's this house. Turn at the corner. You came home so early today. Yes. This way, Xiaoli. Have a seat, Xiaoli. Ayi, you can go out to do your own thing. We don't need you now. OK, I put the thermos outside. OK. Xiaoli, sit down. I'll show you the pictures. Is that you? - Yeah. Here I was very young. This is my father. That's a good picture. It was taken with the help of my cousin. Really? She is studying photography at the Renmin. Listen, Xiaoli, since you are so interested in photography, you should go to the journalism school of the Renmin University. So I have to go to Beijing to study? Why not? We could go together to study in Beijing. Let me show you some more photos, I bet you've never seen them before. Come here! - What is it? Have a look. So many people! Is it the Tian'anmen Square? Yes. My cousin sent them to me from Beijing. Do you know what that is? All the students are on the streets there. I think I saw a bit of it on TV. Just a bit! They don't attend the lectures anymore. I will let you listen to something. What is that? Seems the radio reception is not clear. Let's go out to get a better reception. Come this way, Xiaoli. I think it will be clearer here. Here it comes. The "Beijing Independent Student Group" will send activists to other universities to give speeches and seek support. Ding Li, reporting for Voice of America. Xiaoli, are you alone? - Yes. I wonder whether Lanmi told you anything recently? No. Here, read that. She never told me anything about leaving. I am just learning about that now. Xiaoli, you have to tell me the truth. Where did Lanmi go? I really don't know. Maybe she went back to Anhui? Impossible. She told me she would never go back there. Xiaoli, I don't want to go to school this afternoon. Why not? Activist students from Beijing will have a speech at Fudan University this afternoon. I want to take pictures. Will you come with me? Sure. But I didn't bring my camera. Open it. I've asked you again and again when will you go with me? But you always laugh at me because I just have nothing Don't move that much! I want to give you my dreams and my freedom but you always laugh at me because I just have nothing Xiaoli, faster! Judges appeal to save students! The nation has taught you a lesson! Long live the spirit of the 4 May movement Fight against the cheating journalism! I want to speak! The government should be honest! Deng Xiaoping go play bridge, Li Peng resign! You take really good pictures. Xiaoli, can you print another copy? I want to send them to my cousin. What's wrong? Lili, did you call me? Xiaoli, I just saw my cousin on TV on Tian'anmen Square! Wait! Did you hear it? Yes, very clearly. I want to go to Beijing with you tomorrow to see my cousin. And the Great Wall too. Really? Sure! So we have to buy train tickets? Don't you know? With your student's badge you can take the train for free. But we don't have a badge. Don't worry, I'll get us some. Meet me at the train station tomorrow evening at 7.00. I have to hang up. Don't forget to bring the photos we took! Hello? I just got off the train. My door is locked. Is there anything to eat? There is a slice of cake. Thanks. Water! Where did you go? Guangzhou. Who is he? It looks like he is lecturing. He is a student activist from Beijing. An activist? What for? Don't you know? College students are on hungerstrike now! You don't care about anything. What's the use if I cared? Who cares about me? Grandpa Xiao, what are you cooking? Some soup. Grandpa Xiao, did you know Lanmi has returned? Has she? I haven't seen her for quite a while. Where did the girl go? Guangzhou. How do you know that? Is there something here I don't know? You've got guts to come back here! Lanmi is fighting with her mother again. Let's go upstairs to stop them. Come on let's stop them! Look at this daughter, she's such a big girl now, but you're not capable of acting like one! Have you ever thought about my feelings? Yang, stop cursing, the kid has returned home, hasn't she? She just left without telling me anything. I was too worried to sleep at night! Come on, you were glad! Fine, just leave! And don't you ever come back! I am jumping off the building now! Will that make you happy? Let her jump! Yang, stop cursing! Have you two women finished quarrelling? Well? When do you want to stop? Xiaoli, you have a call. A girl who speaks Mandarin just called, so come quickly to pick it up. I'll be right there. Xiaoli, is that you? Say something! I am at the station, where are you? Hello? Hello? ...poems which reflect people's life, mainly depicting the peasants' situation. But are there any poems about workers? Unfortunately only a few. The reason is, first of all,... Did Jiang Lili come today? No. Any reason? I don't know. ...the classes of the feudalistic society... Lanmi, you left this bag behind last time. Just leave it there. Why aren't you in bed yet? Do you want a coke? There is some. Go get a bottle opener and the cough syrup. Why cough syrup? You'll see, just go get some. The syrup. Do you have any money? Can you lend me some? How much do you need? 200. Why do you need so much? To try my luck. Where? At the hotel? What have you been doing in Guangzhou? Will you lend me the money or not? What are you doing? I won't take your money for free. What do you think I am? Nothing special. What have you been doing in Guangzhou? What does it change if I tell you? Hi, Old Xiao. Hi, Old Jiao, what's up? Turn the TV on. What for? - Something happened in Beijing. You'll see. Xiaoli, turn it on. On the night of May 19th, the government and the Party held a meeting and decided to implement stricter measures to control the situation and to stop the turmoil. To secure the safety of the citizens and the government, and to ensure the proper functioning of the government of Beijing, the army forces in the city aren't sufficient anymore. People often think of willows when spring comes. This is common in classic poetry. But in my opinion, there have not been many good poems in that respect. Today we will look at a poem by Liu Yu Xi that counts as representative. This poem has a unique concept. The first two... What is it? I've talked to teacher Liu, please let Lili come back into class. Ok, let her come in. Come into class. Sorry for the interruption. Let's go on. The poem has a unique concept. The first two lines look like they come from nature. With the North, the poet associates a flute and plum blossoms, with the South the smell of cinnamon. It seems that he wants to express the differences between different areas. 2 students of the 2nd grade have left the school without permission in order to go to Beijing out of so-called solidarity. But they were only craving for sensation. This is a very serious case. Young pupils have become victims of a minority with very different motives. As long as they don't know the truth, they only harm themselves. And it's too late for regret. Why didn't you come to the train station? That day... What happened that day? Something came up. What thing? Just say it! What happened at home? Lili. Forget it. My dad's driver is here to pick me up. I'm dead now. Led by tanks and armored cars, the armed force is entering the city of Beijing from every direction. When confronted by residents and students, they fire into the crowds with shot guns. According to the reports of Associated Press, the U.S. President Bush... Xiaoli, come have breakfast. I just saw Lanmi sleeping at the corner of the alley. How come? She was dead drunk. Everything smelled of alcohol. Is she still lying there? Her mother carried her back home. Grandpa, I have to go now. Come straight back home after school, the situation is getting worse. Did you hear me? How can you do that? Don't you care what people think of you? If you go on like this, you will hit rock bottom. Lili, did you bring your walkman? No. What's this? This morning's Voice of America news. Did you listen to it? Damn, when I'm at home my father won't let me listen to anything. He even took away my radio. Do you know what's going on in Beijing? No, I don't know. I think you should listen to this tape. OK, follow me. Xiaoli, I think we have all the more reason to go to Beijing now. Hurry up! Led by tanks and armored cars, the armed force is entering the city of Beijing from every direction. When confronted by residents and students, they fire into the crowds with shot guns. According to the reports of Associated, the U.S. President Bush learned of the suppression this morning. This way. However, the Americans were told that the Chinese military would be using rubber bullets and pointing the guns above the protesting crowds. 5 o'clock this afternoon, the central radio and TV station in Beijing released an emergency notice, calling all students to evacuate the square. An ultimatum. After 10 o'clock tonight, an armed force of 200,000 soldiers was ordered to advance to the Square from all directions. Hundreds of residents were blocking the route of an armed car, which led to 3 people being seriously injured. Huili, come here. Jiang Lili, come out for a while. What's the matter, teacher? We are in class now. You'll make it up another time. The Public Security Bureau of Beijing has announced that after the martial law was implemented, some leaders of the counter-revolutionary rioters from Beijing and other cities have surrendered and confessed the truth in these days. Most of them were students leaders, others were those who kept secret files of the United League, some of them beat the PLA soldiers with iron rod, others grabbed weapons and communication devices. A shop owner returned the army goods that he had robbed while blocking the army on Chang an street the night of June 3, A factory worker who had grabbed two guns and a box of bullets while blocking an army car the morning of fourth June... Ok, I will call you if we have any news. Thank you for your cooperation. Aren't you asleep yet? I can't sleep. Why didn't my father run away? In a prison, you can't just run away. Why do you ask? Grandpa, some of my photos disappeared. Come here, kitten. Come on. Why did you put them here? Because it's a very good hiding place. During the Cultural Revolution, I hid our family jewellery in it, no red guard could ever find it. Get me the basin. What for? To burn these photos. You said it was safe to hide them here! These pictures weren't easy to take. We can't keep these at home now. No need to discuss this anymore, get me the basin. I'll go to Old Jiao's home tonight. What for? Do you remember comrade Jiang from the district government? Comrade Jiang? Isn't he the one you nearly had a quarrel with? That's him. Old Jiao knows him through connections. The situation could get worse. I think I'll accept the money, and that's it. An egg can't beat a stone. Xiaoli, make sure to be good in America. Did you hear me? Listen to your mother, OK? Xiaoli, Grandpa, could you wait down there? Yes, sure. But hurry up. Where are you going? America. For you. A year after I went to the U.S., Grandpa passed away. After that, I never saw Lanmi or Lili again. I never even wrote to them. Maybe I was subconsciously cutting myself off with the past. I don't know if it was the right thing to do. But I know I was much luckier than them. In the winter of 2008, I returned to China for a photo shooting on assignment for a New York magazine. I went to Shanghai to see my old house. But even though I was finally ready to face my own past, this past was fast disappearing. I didn't come across a single person I once knew. The alley I knew so well had turned into a pile of rubble. As if it had just gone through a war. No one knows when this "war" began, nor when it would end.
