What we must bear in mind is that our business is highly competitive. I'm sorry, Mr. Adams. I think this is something you'll want to read immediately. Hmm. Call Mr. Pringle. Tell him it's urgent. Let me know the minute he arrives. Well, suddenly we've got a problem on our hands, and it's a dilly. A prankster. Oh, no. Not another one. The fifth character to pull this sort of stunt in the last 60 days alone. It used to be the joker who turned in the phony fire alarms. The new gimmick's telling airlines there's a bomb aboard. Mr. Pringle is here. What's up? It could be serious. Mr. Adams is coming right up. I have some people in my office. Let's go here in the conference room. This just came in the mail. None of the others ever demanded money. This has got kind of a different feel to it. Please get me the F.B.I., special agent in charge. This just may be on the level. I have Mr. Frank Cole for you. This is Dan Pringle. I'm security operations officer for 20th century airlines. We just received an extortion letter demanding $500,000. How much? Half a million bucks. If we don't pay, they threaten to blow up one of our planes in midair. A man's on the phone, wants to talk to Mr. Adams. Says it's in regard to a letter he sent marked "urgent. " Hold on just a moment, will you, please? Hello. This is Roger Adams speaking. Did you get our letter regarding the 500,000? Yes. Hold on, please. We mean business, Adams. The time bomb is planted on your flight 74, so you have your crew look for a small package in one of the map pockets. The explosive used is R.D.X. Get our office at the airport at once. Hello. The man just called. Claims he has a time bomb planted on our flight 74. Flight number 74. Where's that plane now, Mr. Adams? It's, uh, left Chicago en route to New York. He says the explosive used is R.D.X. Agent: R.D.X.? Yes. What is it? It's cyclotrimethylene trinitrimide, a powerful new explosive introduced during the last war. It's generally used in a form that looks like cookie dough. A few ounces of R.D.X. Could blow up a whole plane. We'll meet you at the airport, Mr. Adams. Get there as quick as you can. This is Chet Huntley, NBC news, New York. We interrupt the program in progress for this special report. A live bomb was discovered a few moments ago aboard an airplane which had left Chicago bound for New York. Details at this moment are sketchy, but the bomb was found in the airplane after an unidentified person demanding extortion money telephoned airline officials and told them the explosive was aboard. It was thrown from the window of the aircraft by the pilot, who reports that when the bomb hit the ground, it detonated with amazing force. He has told authorities in the airport tower that the device was no larger than an ordinary package of cigarettes. It's believed the bomb contained R.D.X. Outside of nuclear energy, R.D.X. Is the most deadly explosive per pound of weight. Here is another bulletin direct from the airport. The extortionist has telephoned again, claiming there's a second R.D.X. Bomb aboard the plane. This one he says is in the baggage compartment, impossible for the crew to get to it. The plane, 20th century airlines coach flight 74, is now about 10 minutes out of New York. The pilot has been instructed to discharge the passengers on the airstrip. Is there anything wrong, Mr. Molner? ...and the airport is closed to all incoming and outgoing traffic. No. I... just don't feel well. Not well at all. Maybe you should go home, Mr. Molner. Please, I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. West Side hotel. I want to speak to Mr. Paul Hoplin. Mr. Hoplin checked out this morning. But that's impossible. Let me speak to the room clerk. Just a moment, sir. Room clerk. The operator told me that Mr. Hoplin checked out. That's right, sir. Did he say where he was going? He didn't leave any forwarding address. No instructions at all. You sure? Please check. This is important. It's vitally important. Hold the line. Hello? Yes. Mr. Hoplin definitely left no forwarding address. I'm sorry. Good-bye. I'm worried about you, Mr. Molner. Is there anything I can do? No. Maybe I'm coming down with the flu or something. I think I'll take your advice and go on home. Copilot: 9-0-4. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have an emergency. We'll be deplaning on the runway. Kindly follow the instructions of your stewardess. Police bomb squad just arrived. Be here any minute. He's making a pretty fast approach, isn't he? Yeah, he's barreling in like it was a jet. He can handle it. Pull flaps. Props high. Cow flaps open. Little red handle to the rear. To save time, we've decided to use the emergency chute. Could I please have the volunteer of 2 men to go first and steady the chute for us? Clear for right turnoff. Going to ground control. Wing flaps up. Coming up. Cut the outboards. 9-0-4's on the ground. Work fast, men. Now, this is Roy Neal reporting to you direct and live from the airport. Behind me, the plane that's been causing all the excitement. At this very moment, the last few passengers are deplaning. They'll be taken by the F.B.I. Over to the administration building, held there for questioning, and in a few moments, the demolition squad will move in and start looking for that bomb that's aboard the plane. Right now, this is as close as our cameras are permitted to go, but as soon as possible, we'll move in for an even closer look at the action. Darling, is that you? Oh, I didn't expect you home so early. Jim, what's the matter? What's happened? What is it? Have you heard the news? I mean about the bombs, the ones they planted on the airliner? Jim, will you please- shh! Reporter: You are watching the demolition squad going through the baggage that was aboard the plane, still looking for the bomb, and... And wait just a minute. I think they may have found something. Yes, they're moving back. I think the squad have found the bomb, in which case, now begins the most dangerous, ticklish job of them all... Jim, for the last time, what is it? Joan, please! Reporter: That's it. That's the bomb. It seems incredibly small. Such a small device to cause such an excitement and possibly such tremendous destr- Jim... What's this bombing thing got to do with you? I made that bomb. You made it? That's impossible. Jim, this isn't something you fool about. It was mine, Joan. I don't understand. How could you have made that bomb? What do you mean? I got crossed up. Crossed up but good, that's how. Are you expecting anyone? No. No, I'm not. Could it be the police? No, that's stupid. They couldn't have traced it to me. Not this quickly they couldn't have. Wait. What? Hello. I'm Paul. I'm Paul Hoplin. I'm a friend of your husband. May I come in? So help me, I'll kill you! There, there, take it easy. Don't do anything foolish. Just relax. Relax. Come on down. When I say come down, come down. All right, now, both of you... Don't do anything foolish. Who is this man? What is this? What's he done to you? What's he done to me? He's the guy that planted those bombs on the plane. Jim, I think you'd better start right from the beginning. One day this guy barged into my shop. Out of the blue, he barged in. Just who is he? He's a fella I knew in the army. In the demolition squad, to be exact. He said he had an inside track with the army. He said that if I could devise a very small, very compact detonating gismo, he'd get me a government contract, and I believed him. Why not? The idea made sense. Made a lot of sense. Let me cut through all this. I'm the man that duped your husband into making the bomb that makes him the Patsy. It's as short, sweet, and as simple as that. And you intended to use it for this awful purpose right from the start? Oh, yes, ma'am. Right from the word "go. " No! Don't do anything stupid. You were stupid when you left the store early. You're stupid because you got people wondering. Coming on top of this bomb thing, you can't afford to have people wonder, can you, Jimmy boy? Get to the point. Why? I'm in no hurry. You're the one that's in danger, not me. You made the bombs, remember? Incidentally, if you think the police are going to believe your story, you got another thing coming. It's too cockeyed. Personally, I don't think you got a prayer. No, now! Just a minute. I can get it about as quick as that. And I think that's something you should remember. Why don't you be realistic? Even if I got you an army contract, it would only amount to scratch money anyway. So we should put in with you? Why not? You're in already. you are insane. Where's Pat? Is she get home from school yet? Pat?! What's Pat got to do with this? We're going to take a little trip. You and Jim... And Pat and I. The bomb was found in the pocket on the back of seat 12-b. This one right here? Right. The passengers who occupied these seats have been pretty well cleared. Our hottest suspect sat here-4-b. It was a young girl, pretty, smartly dressed. According to the stewardess' chart, this woman got on at Los Angeles, had a through ticket to New York but left the plane in Chicago. I see. That plane Denver and Chicago. Mm-hmm. Suitcase containing the bomb was checked through to New York by one of the passengers boarding at Los Angeles. May I see you down here for a moment, please? It was probably that woman. So she blew the plane in Chicago- excuse me. Mr. Adams would like to see you in the conference room right away. Thank you. Be right there. She blew the plane in Chicago knowing she'd be questioned here. Exactly. And she probably dropped that second bomb in the map pocket while the aisle was crowded with debarking passengers. I want a complete description of this woman. Question everybody onboard. Right. Get the Chicago office to try to get a line on her. I will. I want complete sets of everyone on that plane. Bill... Vacuum every particle around the seat that this woman occupied. Put the laboratory to work on it full force around the clock. You'll have our full, all-out cooperation. We've advised our key men right down the line to make all our facilities available to you. Good. Question the ground crews, anyone who had access to that plane. Work with these boys, Bert. Begin by checking on disgruntled employees, anyone who has been fired in the last few months. The manufacturer saw the timing device on TV. Thinks his company made some of the parts. Good, good. Canvass anyone who purchased those parts in the last 6 months. Put all the men on this you can possibly use. Over here, please. We just had another phone call. The extortionist? Yes. We're to run an ad in the personal column of this evening's paper. It's to read, "Mary, come home. All is forgiven. John. " That signifies we're willing to pay the 500,000. If the ad doesn't appear, the next bomb will be exploded in a plane in midair. That's a grim choice. Why can't this caller be traced? Phone company's doing the best they can. He never talks for more than a few seconds at a time. Gentlemen, let's face it. This guy's one step ahead of us, all the way. A bomb this small could be planted anyplace. We can't search every passenger, every inch of a plane, every piece of luggage. He can paralyze the whole system. What are we going to do? Strictly your decision, gentlemen. The policy of the bureau is not to interfere in matters of this kind. We've got to play for time. You mean run the ad? Exactly. Naturally, the longer we stall, the better chance we have of getting this fella before he pulls something else. But this demand may be only the beginning. That's right. Either we close down the airline or pay the extortion money. There's no alternative. Under the circumstances, if one of our planes was blown up, we'd be morally responsible for every life lost. Morally responsible? Hell, we'd be murderers. It's bad enough you putting a price on human lives, and it's bad enough you making these vicious, evil threats to extort money, but why do you have to involve an innocent child in this? Settle for Joan and me. We'll go with you. We'll go with you now, do anything you like. I'll phone Miss Southport. Don't touch the phone. You can keep your gun in my back the whole time. I'll tell her we're going away. I'll ask her to take Pat. She's taken her before. She'll think nothing of it. I said put the phone down. Maybe you can get away with kidnapping 2 adults, but a little girl, that's different. She'll be a dead giveaway. Everyplace you take her, she's going to be a dead giveaway. Will you stop smirking at me that way? Will you stop it?! Honey, please. Look, I can understand a guy risking a few years in jail for a stake of a half million bucks. That makes some sense, at least, but kidnapping? That's something else again. It's a capital offense. Yes, Jim's right. The minute you take us outside that door, you're gambling with your life. So? Don't people gamble with their lives every day? Not with these odds, they don't. They don't? Let's take an example of a racing driver, hmm? Going along at 150 miles an hour, he gets a blowout, and he smears himself across the brick wall. Isn't that chance, a throw of the dice? Hmm? So? So mine's a game of skill. It's me against the F.B.I. Go back, Pat! Go back! Don't leave the bus! Shut up. Easy does it! Easy! Run into the house, dear, and see what your mother wants. Shut the door. Then she was calling. Were you calling me, mommy? Why, no, Pat, darling. Everything's all right. Hi, daddy. Hi. Who's he? Oh, just somebody your daddy knows. Pat, darling, we're going to take a little trip. I want to get my dolly. Where are we going? We're just going to take a short ride. Let's go. Well, come on. When I say "let's go," that's exactly what I mean. Ok. Keep moving. Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get in front. Put on the taped glasses. You, too. Shut the door. All right. Move, move, move. Want to take a look at this? How about the mug book? Any luck? Nah. I'm afraid they're far too sharp to have used anyone with a record to plant those bombs. But we've got one of the stewardesses over here, and every passenger remembers seeing the woman. I think we're getting somewhere. Good. So far we've apparently built up a pretty good likeness. They all agree on that. A short pug. The only thing they haven't agreed upon is the nose. This is try number 10 - concave and pointed. That's much closer. Amazing how much a nose will change a person's whole appearance. Yeah. How about this one? Hey, right on schedule. Why not? Figured it out. Went smooth as a grunion. That Paul's the greatest. Isn't the boss kind of living it up? So it cost him a month's rent, but there are no neighbors. All the molners can see from the windows are shrubs. Oh, I get it. Then... A shrub's a shrub. Pretty cool. They can holler their heads off. Nobody would hear. Hey, come on down. I want you to get a load of the pool. Not bad. Not bad at all. There it is. Very nice. But I'm more interested in the bar. Hi. Hi. Kelly, this is Mr. and Mrs. Molner. Hi. What'll it be? The nearest bottle. Show her that. Yes, sir. Kelly, wait. "Mary, come home. All is forgiven. John. " Looks mighty pretty in print. Translated, that means, "come and get it," Mr. Molner. And there's your picture, right on the front page. Mmm. How about that? A pretty good likeness, too. We're big stuff, Kelly. Those F.B.I. Monkeys are batting their brains out. Come on, Kelly. I want to talk to you. They're going to kill us. Shh! Joan, honey. Well, we're only in their way. Why shouldn't they kill us? The penalty for kidnapping's the same. Whether we're alive or whether we're dead, it's the same. At least... At least they're not going to do it right off. They've got something in mind first. But eventually they will kill us. But why Pat?! Shh! We'll sneak her out somehow. We just got to wait our chance. They'll never let us out of their sight. We've got to try anything. Regardless of how hopeless the odds, we've got to try it. Hey, get a load of this. Get a load of what? What it says here. "Of the 10,957 cases "investigated by the F.B.I. In 1956, 96.4% ended in conviction. " That's just splendid. You want a drink or something? Be my guest. It's quite a game of skill you're playing, when the odds are 96.4% against you. Look, this girl's picture's on the front of every newspaper. How are you going to get away with that? Simple. Not let anybody see her, that's all. Let me have your glass, honey. But she got off the plane in Chicago. They'll trail her. Mm-mm. Not in a day, they won't. In fact, I doubt if they can do it in a week. Not the way I zigzagged and backtracked, they won't. Where'd you get the R.D.X.? There's one thing they can trace. Can they? All the way to Mexico? You ever hear of a jet perforator? They use it for blasting oil wells. It contains R.D.X. Well, they sell them down there, no questions asked. And the typewriter we used for the extortion note is at the bottom of Lake Michigan. The paper was bought in a dime store in Kansas City. Suitcase was found on a garbage dump in Phoenix. You see? They'll trace all the parts to your shop. But unfortunately, they can't trace you. And there are no fingerprints anywhere. Paul's been working on this for over a year. He's the greatest. If you're going to kill us, kill us now and get it over with! Mommy! Mommy! Shh! Pat, it's all right. Shh, darling. Mommy's here. Think you need a drink. So you got all the answers. How about the payoff? How are you going to collect that money? It's simple. I'm going to let your wife collect it for me. You... I'm going to collect... What do you mean she's going to collect it? That's exactly what I said. You crazy? I suppose you want her to tell the F.B.I. The whole story. I'm gambling she won't tell the F.B.I. I'm also gambling that the F.B.I. Will give her the money. And you think that I'd do it, that I'd be any part of this filthy thing?! You'll do it. Here. Oh! You'll do it. You'll do it... Though you won't know where Patty is. She'll be miles away. So you better pull it off... Or she dies. Kelly will be there... With this. Ready to use it. Ever see one of these before? It's called a shiv. It's sharp. It's got a point as sharp as a needle. Goes through a person's body so fast, they hardly feel it. And the sides are sharp, too. They've been ground down, and they're like a razor. Let me show you. See? You hardly felt it. Cut it off like it was butter. A shiv like this can slip, slip very easily. I'd keep that in mind if I were you. I'm never going to let you take Pat from me. Never! Never! Boy, if you got it all figured out, there's just one thing wrong, one little thing. How are you going to collect that money if we're dead? Did you think for one second we'd let you take this child from us, that we'd let her go alone with that vicious, sadistic woman? Did you honestly think that? Even if we have to die right here and now. That's the way we feel, Paul. What's more, we're walking out that front door. If you want to shoot us in the back, all 3 of us, go ahead and do it. But Pat doesn't go without us. Come here. All right, Jim. Let's go. You got to be a good shot to get that close. The next one's going to be a bull's-eye. Ok, I'll buy your terms. Hold it. Hold it! Come back. Come on. A little way from the door. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. All right, Steve. Go get the door. Go on. That's no bluff. They mean it. So, what now? So, what now? Molner goes with Pat. You expect me to handle them both? All right, Vince can go with you. Who's going to watch the broad while you're not here? You're not going to leave her alone with the creep? Unfortunately, at the moment, I can't be concerned with moral obligations. At least we can rely on Steve for one thing - she won't escape. Ok, but I don't like that. So you don't like it! All right, Mr. Molner... All right, you two get your things together. Get ready to go. I buy your terms. You go with Pat. It's a calculated risk. Why not? Ok, I'll give you 10 seconds to think it over. 6... 7... 8... I don't know how, but I'll get Pat out of this. Somehow I'll get her out. Mrs. Molner's staying. Fine. Come on. Let's move, the two of you. Come on, let's move. Mommy! Pat! Pat! Jim! Reporter:... believe that the timing mechanisms used in the device were actually constructed at this workbench, right here in Jim Molner's electrical shop. ...I'd like to show you some parts, exact duplicates of those... We have to stall as long as we dare. Don't overdo it. Hello? Mr. Adams' residence. Listen, don't try to pull this on me again. Now, I'm going to call back in about 15 minutes, and I want Adams to answer immediately. That means at once, you understand? I had your local exchange on the other phone. They have to trace back through at least 2 more selector banks before they can even determine what exchange the call's coming from. Hmm. All you can do is stand by the phone now, Mr. Adams. Yes, sir. How long have you known them? About 2 years. What sort of people are they? I always thought they were just nice... What are those pills you keep taking? Bennies. Bennies? What's that? Benzedrine, that's what it is. I need them bad. Oh. This guy in there, he got me started on them. In where? In the stir. He said it was just to do me a favor. But it was the dough he was after. Do you have to keep staring at me that way? I don't mean nothing. Roger Adams speaking. You have the money at the first national bank tomorrow at exactly 12 noon. At that time, you'll be advised when, where, and how to deliver the money. Now, I want $500,000. I want it in $20 bills, and they're to be evenly divided among the 12 federal reserve districts. Brother. That's an order. 16 seconds is all he talked. It's hopeless. You gentlemen realize the magnitude of this job? Breaking that money down into 12 districts might involve sorting through 10, 20, or even 30 million bills. Well, the federal reserve bank is the only place that can handle a thing like this. It's Henderson's ball now. This blocks any chance of giving this guy bills with consecutive serial numbers, you know that, don't you? Yes. I got to hand it to this cookie. It's a good gimmick. I'll try. I doubt if the job can be done by noon tomorrow. Each girl can only sort through about 3,500 bills in an hour. We've got to meet this deadline. With a guy like this, you don't kid around. All right. All right. All I can do is get my supervisor to hop right on it. Now, watch him, Kelly. All right, Molner. This is it. Come on. If you were expecting some deserted shack in the woods, I'm sorry to have crossed you up. We're not that corny. You're not dealing with two-bit jerks, you know. This is a plush operation. Come on, move it. We're taking you to my penthouse, no less, on the roof, all by itself. Soundproof. No inquisitive visitors. The greatest. You must be doing ok, Kelly-o, to afford a pad like that. Must have spent over a grand on this stuff while I was in there. You spent it all on benzedrine? Yeah. Sure. When you're in there and you get thinking about the dames and sex and all, they really help. Make you forget. Why were you in prison? Wasn't my fault. It was a bad deal. What do you mean, a bad deal? Well, it was down in Georgia, see? I was out this night, and this dame picked me up. She picked you up? Yeah. Yeah. And then she started fooling around a little. Oh, I didn't mean anything. You know what I mean. I was just fooling around. Well, she started it, and I went along. Who wouldn't? Exactly why were you arrested? Well, she started it. You know what I mean. Well... When a dame starts fooling around with a guy, he gets kind of excited, that's all. You attacked her? She started it. She started it. She kept after me until... Well, it wasn't my fault. I'm only flesh and blood. Will you leave me alone?! All right, come up. We have to use the stairs. The elevator doesn't go to the penthouse. Come on, move fast. These stairs are the only way up, in case you're interested. Class, huh? There's a view for you. The greatest, huh? The whole of queens. The best room's upstairs. Come on. I'll show you the bar. 14 stories high, no fire escapes. The stairs you came up are the only way you can get down. Hello. Yeah. We're here. Everything's ok. You really barreled along, didn't you? Is Pat all right? Hold it. I've got to talk to her. Please let me talk to her! Hold it. She's ok. She's with her old man, ain't she? No, you don't undeierstand. A mother, that's different. You see, Pat's never been away from me before. Never for a night and never like this. Please. Please, just let me talk to her. Please? Yeah. I guess it would be ok. Put the little girl on. Is Paul there? Did he say it was ok? Yeah, sure, you egghead. Paul said it was all right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello, Pat? Yes, darling. Mommy's all right. Yes. How's daddy? Is he- oh! Let me alone! Let me alone! You pig! You filthy, horrible pig! Pig! You keep away from me! You keep him away... Keep him away from me. I can't take it anymore! Paul, I didn't do nothing. Paul, I didn't do nothing! Stand still. Stand still. All right, where's the bennies? Paul, I haven't got any bennies. No bennies, huh? What's that? What's that, huh? No bennies? You don't have any, do you, boy? Now, Paul. Listen to me. You listen to me. I swear, the next time, I'll kill you. You understand that? The next time, I kill you. Yes, Paul. You understand? Yes. I... I won't take them no more, I promise. No more. Listen to me. None of this would have happened... Just let your kid go along with Kelly, it would have been fine, see? For the girls just arriving, you're to segregate the $20 bills into the 12 federal reserve districts. Take your places, girls, and thank you very much for coming in. Will you take your places, please, girls? The money's on your desks. Just separate them into the 12 federal reserve districts. Thank you very much for coming in. This is an emergency. We're keeping a running tabulation on the bills as we sort them. It'll take approximately 2,084 from each district. I assure you, he intends pulling something from left field. What, I don't know, but it's not going to be any old wheeze like throwing the money from a train platform at a given signal. About all we can do is saturate the entire New York area with cars. That's right. We've got to be able to tail them in relays or converge on any spot in a few seconds. From there on, we play it by ear. It's going to take time to set up this machinery. Exactly. That's why we brought you here at 4 A.M. What's going to stop this guy from tuning in on our police calls and beating us to the punch? Or on our own F.B.I. Wavelengths, for that matter. Just a minute, boys. You all have ordinary car radios. You're going to be tuned to a disk jockey on WNEW-Bruce Wendell. We're funneling our instructions through him. He's agreed to interrupt his show at any time to relay the calls to you. Yeah, and one thing is certain- any guy pulling a fancy caper like this isn't going to have time to sit around listening to a disk jockey. That's for sure. All right, you all have your instructions. Hop to it. Ok, you're clear. I'm back. Everything's set. Wendell's been fully briefed. I'm leaving Stafford here. Right. Thanks a lot, Bruce. More than welcome. Anytime. See you later. Wait a minute. You got to have the money back by 1:30. That's the deadline. 1:30 exactly. Lady... Would you be polite enough to shut the door? The instructions given me were explicit. They began with my entering this bank. I was to ask for Mr. Adams, president of 20th century airlines. Hoplin said he'd be there. Pardon me. Yes, Miss? Could you please tell me where I could find Mr. Adams? Mrs. Molner. Thank you. Mrs. Molner. Would you come this way, please? Who's that? This woman is here to see you, Mr. Adams. She says her name is Mrs. James Molner. Mrs. Molner? She came here? And of her own volition. It's incredible. My husband made the timing mechanism used for those bombs. That you already know. He was tricked into it. He had no idea it was going to be used for this terrible, terrible purpose. They came to our house, and they kidnapped us. At the point of a gun, they kidnapped us. And last night... Last night they took away my husband and my little girl and... And I don't know where they took them. I don't know where they took them. They... They've threatened to kill them if I didn't come here to collect the money. Anyway, this is the box you're to put the money in. They threatened to kill them if you didn't give it to me or if you tried to follow me or if anything goes wrong, anything at all! They gave me a deadline. I have to be back with the money at 1:30. That's their deadline. 1:30 on the dot. And if I'm late... If I'm just one minute late, my husband... And my daughter will both be murdered! They'll both be murdered, and that's why I'm here! This is utterly fantastic. How do we even know this woman is Mrs. Molner? She's Mrs. Molner, all right. How else would she have known you were here? Besides, we have photographs of her and her little girl. You had pictures and didn't give them to the newspapers? That would be the last thing we would do. If this woman is telling the truth, we would have been signing her death warrant. We probed the Molner family pretty carefully. Their being part of this thing just didn't add up. You believe her story? Let's put it this way - it could be true. Put that money in the box right away. Wait a minute. You're going to give her the money and let her walk out of here scot-free? Here's the little girl's picture. But this woman may be lying. Could be just a trick. You admit yourself she may be lying. That's quite true. Then again, she may not be. Would you care to have that little girl's death on your conscience? Well, no, but... Gentlemen, I don't know where this is going to end, but I'm not going to gamble with lives, even if it means busting the company. Get going. They didn't think for one minute you'd give me the money because of my husband and little girl. This man in back of it, he's horrible and vicious. He told me to give you this. The threat against my husband and little girl was just to force me into coming here. This was the lever to make you give me the money. One of these is planted where it will kill 100 people. It isn't set to go off till 1:45. They'll notify you where it is, notify you in time, if I'm back with the money at 1:30. I want every plane grounded. Radio the pilots. Have them land at the nearest fields. Get the passengers off the plane. That's an order. Send the cars from group "a" down to the airport. Alert the police. Have the demolition squad go over the place from top to bottom. I suggest they start with the public lockers. Wait a minute. How about the hangars? We employ a lot of people there. Include the hangars. Anyplace else you can think of. Oh, it's useless. They've hidden the bomb where no one can find it. Believe me. I know them. Could be anyplace in the United States. Right here in the bank, for that matter. Anyway, search everywhere. Do the best you can. Get it organized. I'll take care of it. Officer: It's ready, sir. This is only the beginning, you know. These men have to be stopped. This can only end one way-in disaster. Who's behind it? A man. His first name is Paul. That's all I know about him. Except he was in the demolition squad with my husband. Have the army check Molner's record, who he served with. Hop on it. Who else is in it? There's a woman. They call her Kelly. She's with Jim and Pat. Oh, that picture in the paper, it was a good likeness of her. Any other men? Look, it's 11 minutes after 12:00. I want these men caught more than anyone else in this room, but I have to be back there at 1:30 with the money. Where are you taking it? No. If you try to follow me, they can tell. They have it all figured out. It's the one thing I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. You don't know? I'm to get my instructions along the way. These other men, what can you tell us about them? One they call Steve. He has a record. He attacked a woman once. Where? In Georgia. I think he said Georgia. Oh, here's something- he's a benzedrine addict. He started taking them in prison. What prison? Oh, look, another minute's gone by... Check the Georgia prisons... It might take me an hour... He may be an addict. Mrs. Molner, this is our one chance. You understand that. Look, it's not only her husband and daughter, it's the lives of 100 other people. We're aware of that. Where did they take you? A big house. They made us wear taped glasses. We couldn't see. Please hurry. Look, when you were on the inside, you could see through the windows? Yes, yes. Please hurry. All right, now, this is very heavy. Oh, about these windows - what did you see? Just a garden and a high hedge. And how long did it take to drive there from your house? Oh, I don't know. It was an hour. Maybe more. I don't know. This man Paul, can you describe him? He's about 35, heavyset, wears glasses. Look, how does anybody describe anybody?! Won't you please let me go? All right, Mrs. Molner. All right. The machinery's all set. They can pick her up the minute she leaves this bank. We've got a perfectly greased setup. There are 26 cars waiting to move in. No one car will tail her for more than a block. Chances are 9 out of 10 they'll never spot our tail. That gives us 1 chance out of 10 that 102 people will be killed. The answer's no. Chuck, grab the first plane to Washington. I think our best chance of cracking this thing is in the lab. Camp there. Stay with it. Right. I wondered, was it a trick? Were the F.B.I. Trailing me after all? Or were they letting me walk out with half a million dollars scot-free? The uncertainty was nerve-racking. When I got to the corner, the signal was against me. I had to wait. Every foot I was to travel, every move I was to make had been planned and rehearsed and drilled into me. He called it foolproof. That was Hoplin's claim. If I followed his meticulous directions, no one could tail me, not without my knowing it. Yet my eyes kept darting furtively toward the door. I found myself anxiously studying the face of every person entering the building. Was that person an F.B.I. Agent? Was I being followed? I had been instructed to get off on the eighth floor, head down the corridor, and go directly to the stairs. Here I was to wait 50 seconds. 50 seconds exactly. Time was running out on me fast, alarmingly fast. It was 12:37. It was torture just standing there waiting, waiting for those seconds to pass. Those 50 agonizing seconds seemed like an eternity. 16 seconds more to go. Now 13 seconds left. 9 seconds... Then I'd had it. It was still hard to believe that the F.B.I. Weren't trailing me. A tan convertible was parked in the alley, sitting there, waiting for me, just as he said it would be. My instructions were to proceed directly to the West Side highway and head north toward the Bronx. I was to flip on the radio. It would already be tuned in on the Bronx police calls. In the glove compartment, I'd find the rest of my orders written out for me in detail. "Your next instructions will come over the police radio. "Listen for reference to redheaded prowler. "Go to the address. "The street number will be given to you in reverse and the adadline- 1:30 on the dot. " Hoplin's touch of sardonic whimsy. Who else would have the audacity to use police calls to transmit his instructions? Hello. Let me have the police department. Hello. Hello. Listen, there's some screwball been hanging around my place all day, and I'd like to have you come over and investigate. He's redheaded. Yeah. Uh... my address is, uh... This is a code 2. Go to riverdale section. 1271 kappock street. A man reports a prowler. The prowler is redheaded... 1-2-7-1. Unscrambled that was... 1-7-2-1. That's it. 1721 kappock street. When I turned the corner, I thought I had room to make it between a truck ahead and a safety island. But the truck kept edging me over. When I saw I couldn't squeeze through, it was too late. I had to swing to the right, swing fast. Officer: You can't stop here, lady. Don't you understand? Now, get going or I'm going to give you a ticket! There were now only 34 minutes left before the deadline. I was boxed in a 2-lane strip of highway headed for Brooklyn, headed in the exact opposite direction from kappock street. And when I crossed through the tunnel, what then? How much further I'd still have to go before I could turn around I didn't know. 10 points. Hey, what gives? That adds up to 11. So sue me. Look, I'm not in the mood. Chicken? What do you mean chicken? You're sweating. Look at you. Your hand shakes like an old woman. How it shakes. It shakes. Boy, I swear. Pshew... I met a lot of weird doxies in my day. You top 'em all. Putting a shiv in this little kid's belly wouldn't bother you at all, would it? Sure, it would bother me... But not a half a million dollars' worth. I didn't have a chance of making riverdale by 1:30, not if I kept within the speed limit, not if I obeyed the law and stayed in one lane. Look, honey, I knocked a guy off once. That was in the heat of pulling the job. That's different. See, that's a lot different. Hey, take it easy. Relax. Nothing's going wrong. Paul's the greatest, remember? Yeah. So it works today. He's not going to let them live. You know that. Where's the nearest place I can turn around? About a quarter of a mile further on, lady. Take the center lane. Thank you. Come and sit down, ok? Yeah. Daddy, when are we going to see mommy? Soon, honey. Ha ha! Funny dog. He's tied his nose up with a piece of ribbon. When I finally reached the place where I could turn back, the stoplight was against me. All I could do was sit there and wait. Don't you ever clean? She ain't here yet. I said she ain't here yet. Mm-hmm. Well, she ought to be here by now. It's 1:16 already. Better check your watch because it's 1:08. 1:08. Even with the hardest kind of driving and every traffic break in my favor, any chance of making riverdale by 1:30 was pretty dim. And a $90 check made out to the same party... She should be here by now. You said that already. How can you live in a mess like this? At this speed, it was just asking for a cop to pick me up, but what else could I do? It was now 1:11. It's a piece of chewing gum magnified 400 times. Notice the perfect impression we have of the bite. It was found on the plane in an ashtray. The ashtray was on the seat next to where our suspect was sitting. And it was chewed by a woman. There were traces of lipstick. For the moment, it's our best lead. They're making a plaster of paris mold of the teeth. Have a look. The irregular position of the bicuspids is a big help. Also, the first bicuspid has 2 surface fillings. That's important in making an identification. At last I was back, headed up the ramp to the West Side highway. This was an overhead thoroughfare and a direct route to riverdale. Ok, ok. Why isn't she here? Shut up. You told her to take the West Side highway, didn't you? Well, how long did it take you to make it here from the battery? 20 minutes? 25? All right! So maybe I drive faster than she does. Yeah. And maybe they trailed her. Maybe they caught up with her. Maybe they didn't, huh? Maybe they didn't. Hold on now. Where are you going? I'm going to lay her down on the bed. You have any objection? Go ahead. My eyes kept darting from the dashboard clock to the road behind. At any second, a speed cop could appear. That would be the end. When do you expect the call? What call? The call from Paul. Paul? Reporting on the money... Whether my wife has or has not delivered it to him. Look, I'm not telling you anything. Come on, what time? What time? Yeah. Ok... 1:30. 9 minutes from now. It's 1:22. I don't like it, Paul. I just don't like it. Something's gone wrong. Nothing's gone wrong. She'll be here. There were 8 minutes left, 8 short, vanishing minutes, and that was it. Well, this does it. 1:28. I'm blowing out of here. You're not going anywhere. Now, nobody walks out on me. Then why ain't she here? Why ain't she here?! I don't know why she ain't here, and I don't know why you don't keep your big, fat mouth shut. I had 3 miles to go and 4 minutes to make it in. Well? 1:30. I'll give her one more minute... One more minute, and that's it. That's it. Hello. Hello. This is Paul. Look, it's 1:31. She hasn't come yet. It's 1:31. She hasn't arrived yet. I thought you were the big mastermind, the guy who never pulled boo-boos. Do what you're told. You know what to do. Hey, there's a car coming up the street, coming up fast. He says hold on a minute. There's a car coming up the street. Listen, hang on a minute. Give me a hand. That's it. All right, get busy. Start checking it. Hello, Kelly. This is Paul. Look, we got the money. We're checking it now. So far, everything looks fine. Yeah, all right. It's ok. Everything's fine, fine, fine, fine. Uh... Yeah. There wasn't any bomb. Not this time, there wasn't. Come on. Let's get back to the office. Positive identification can be made from tooth irregularities. These depressions are the fossa, and these projections are the ridges. Like fingerprints, no 2 teeth are identical in every respect. Now, how do you determine the length of the woman's teeth? Well, there's a correlation between width and length. Now, this amalgam filling gives us a break. The chipped edges along the ridges here help in identification- now, you feel you have an exact replica of the woman's teeth? That's right. All right, have them photographed. Run off several hundred copies. This is Charles Pope. I'd like to place a New York call. I'll be back in a couple hours. You're not going to leave me here with this man. I'm not going to leave you here alone, that's a cinch. Well, then let me go with you, please. Anything. Anything at all, but don't leave me here with this... Degenerate. Ha ha. Degenerate. Please. You know, I don't understand you, lady. First, you have a husband and daughter who missed death by the narrow margin of 30 seconds, and now you stand here with this anticlimactic fate-worse-than-death routine. Well, I have news for you. It's no sale. Please! Women talk too much. Sometimes they say things they shouldn't say. Now, there's every possibility that the dentist who put in the filling took the x-rays. The fact that her first or last name is Kelly and that she's young, pretty, a brunette, and has a particular type of amalgam filling should funnel the dentists we have to interview down to a few dozen. Of course, the work could have been done anywhere. Well, it's a fair guess it was done right here in New York City. Their activities seem to be centered here. At any rate, it's worth a try. What can we lose? Ok, thanks. Bring the photos. Get here as quickly as you can. As soon as pope gets here, start canvassing every dentist in New York City. Include all the boroughs. Keep it up around the clock. We can get the dentists' home phone numbers from the a. D.A. Good. Put a team on it right now. All we had gained is a stay of execution. Then and there, I made up my mind I was going to save Pat's life, regardless of how I did it, regardless of the risk. I could see the door of the elevator housing. I wondered if there was any way to get from the floor of that room into the elevator shaft itself. Look, honey, I'm going to leave you for a little while. Just stay here. Don't you worry. It was a desperate idea, but it was worth investigating. I need a little fresh air. Funny... Pat's life and mine might depend on something as trivial as whether a door was locked or unlocked. I was fighting time. I'd been fighting time ever since Hoplin came to our house. At any moment, Vince or Kelly could get curious and decide to check up on me. Now... was that door locked or unlocked? There was an opening into the shaft. It was small, just large enough for a man to squeeze through, but it was there. Suppose the car started up while I was midway sliding down the cables? It was terrifying just looking down that hole. I decided to wait until after midnight, when the fewest people were using the elevator. Then I'd try it. They were always after me. Please, I just don't want to hear any more. Maybe they knew I was an ex-con. When they started chasing me, I'd take a couple of bennies just to keep going. They wouldn't leave me alone. Why isn't he back? He's been gone nearly a couple of hours. It's nearly 6:00. You see, there was a story in the papers about a guy in a blue convertible... Who raped a dame. My brother asked me if I was the one, and I told him I couldn't remember. You couldn't remember? Yeah, that's right. Those troopers, they were always after me. They got me all mixed up. They said I tried to pull a knife on her. You killed her! Honest, I wouldn't have laid a finger on her, but... but she saw the knife, and I knew I was in trouble. She would have called the cops. I won't listen to this. I just won't listen to this! She was the one! She made it worse on herself. If she would have left me alone, everything would have been all right. It wasn't my fault. Oh... No! I wouldn't try that! Why did I make that dash for the door? Why? As long as they were holding my husband and my daughter at the point of a gun, I couldn't leave. It was the last thing I could do. Ov no, I'm afraid not. She wasn't my Patient. Well, it's highly important you keep looking. If you have any luck, call us here. Thank you, doctor. Another blank? Uh! Aah! Can I have a package of cigarettes, please? All right, thank you. Uh! Where's Steve? He went out. Out? What do you mean he went out? It was the benzedrine. He just had to have some. You know how he was. Uh-huh. So, he just left you here alone, huh? Why not? I was alone when I went to the bank, wasn't I? What's the difference- the difference is I told him to stay here. That's the difference. I guess he figured I wouldn't jeopardize my husband and Pat. Anyway, I... I guess that's what he thought. How about a drink? What do you mean, how about a drink? I'd like to have one. Last time I offered you a drink, you threw it on the floor. I know, but I'd just like to have a drink. Seems to be only bourbon here. That'll be fine. All right. Looks like this Steve is a pretty sloppy housekeeper. He was sort of in a bad way when he left this afternoon. What if he doesn't come back? That would be a pity... Be a pity, especially for you. What do you mean, a pity for me? Because I was counting on Steve for my next job. Maybe he was afraid to come back. You threatened to kill him. You did. Remember? I remember. In that case, I'm afraid I'd just have to find a way to persuade you to take his place. Here's your... Here's your drink. You're very shaky. Being left alone with an animal like that is enough to unnerve any woman! I imagine it is. Here. Put these on when we get in the car. Where are we going? We're going to an apartment, Vince's apartment, if it's any interest to you. Maybe you don't think it's time we changed the base of operations. Anyway, Steve wasn't much use to me. Well, come on. Come on. One thing is certain, isn't it? He's no use to me at all now, is he? Isn't that right? What do you mean? I mean he's dead. Shall we go? Go on. I want a picture of this Molner woman. Dig up every friend and relative. Somebody must have a photo of her. I don't care how you get it, but get it. Ok. I waited until nearly 2:00. I knew that the later I made it, the better my chances that no one would use the elevator. Of course, it was a fearful gamble at best, but I figured that if I coul slide down those hose cables and get out through the car, I could then call the police, come back, and save Pat. I realized if I was on those cables and the car started up, I'd either have to fall to my death or be crushed in the machinery above. It wasn't a very pleasant choice. I'm going out to get some sandwiches and beer. One thing was certain- there'd be no turning back. Once I lowered myself into that shaft, I'd never have the strength to pull myself up again. Wait. Wait a minute. Have a good night, sir. $1.45. 7, 8, 9. Thank you very much. We hated to get you down here at this time of night, doctor, but it's a matter of grave importance, believe me. They called her Kelly. Of course, it could be a nickname. Somewhere on the sides of that door was a catch which would open it, but where it was I didn't know. My dear, what floor are you going to? Top. Would you mind very much taking me down first? I've just had a call from the hospital. My husband's had a turn for the worse. This photo doesn't show much of the sides of the teeth. But the view from the top, the misalignment of bicuspids, appears to be identical. Hey... this is it. Look. Both bicuspids have the same filling and tooth structure. And it isn't Joyce. It's Eileen Kelly. She's your girl, all right. I see. What's that address, doctor? Evermire arms, 52nd and east river drive- just a few minutes from here. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor. You're welcome. I wondered how much clearance there'd be between the roof of the elevator and the top of the shaft. Would it be a matter of feet... or inches? Beer? Yeah. Oh. I want to use your telephone. Where is it? Who are you? What is this? Get me the police, and hurry. Want to get Molner? Yeah, honey. I'll get him in a minute, huh? Just one minute, please. Get here as fast as you can. What's this all about? Hey, Molner. Molner? Kelly. Kelly! Kelly! Kelly, Molner's gone! He's gone! Come on! I'd like to see Miss Eileen Kelly, please. She's in the penthouse. Take the elevator to the 13th floor. Thank you. And walk up one flight. Right. Where is he?! I don't know how he did it, but he's gone. What do we do, Vince? We got to blow this place fast. He's called for the cops. That's for sure. Let's go! Come on! Oh, how about the brat? I'm going to take care of her. Will you forget about her? I'm coming back up. Cover the door. Come on up. All right, I am. I'm Jim Molner- I know. We're F.B.I. They got my daughter upstairs, and they're going to kill her. How many are there? Just 2 - a man and a woman. Stay back. This is the F.B.I. We're coming in. Drop your guns. Hold it right there! Come on down. You stupid jerk. Over by the wall. Put your hands on top of your head. Work quickly, boys. Pat's still asleep in the bedroom. They haven't touched her. Good. What about my wife? What about her? When Hoplin finds out what's happened here - He'll kill her. He'll kill her! Yeah, I know. It's bad news, all right. Really bad. Well, with all this commotion going on around here, it was bound to get to the reporters. Well, it's hot copy. If Paul reads this, he'll kill her. There's only one man that can save your wife. There he sits, right in there. He knows where they are. Haven't been able to break him down yet. We haven't even made a dent. Not doing much better with that Kelly girl. We got a couple of men interrogating her at the emergency hospital. Let's get back to work. You understand, this is a little offbeat, questioning the guy here in this apartment. But if that phone call comes through, he's got to be here. That's a cinch. Just stay there a minute. All rightie. Just sit down over there. Go on, go on. Sit, sit, sit, sit. All right. It's a shame Vince had to go with your husband because it means you have to take Steve's place now. I want to talk to Jim, and I want to talk to Pat. You'll talk. You'll talk. I want to talk to them now. Isn't that funny? You wouldn't think that Vince would be a connoisseur of art. I want to talk to them now. You'll talk. I told you you'll talk to them. Now! Shut up. I said you'll talk to them. You want a cup of coffee? For the last time, where is she? You guys must be nuts. I mean, why should I rat on a pal of mine to save some broad, huh? I mean, why? I'll give you one good reason- because a jury might be inclined to be a little easier on you if you cooperate to help save this woman's life. Easier. Easier, the man says. You hear him? What are they going to do for me? They going to put a feather pillow on the electric chair? Is that what you mean by easier? Look, buster, the jury's going to throw the book at me either way, and you jokers know it. You aren't going to see any part of that 500,000. That's for sure. I know it. I know it. I also know what happens to guys that sing. I don't want some stir-crazy bum sticking a shiv in my back! I'll make him talk! Take it easy. Where is she?! Where is she?! Take it easy. Ok, ok. Believe me, Mr. Molner, we know exactly how you feel, but that's not going to help. That phone's going to ring any minute. Everything depends on that man. He's got to answer it, make like everything's ok. I think we have a 50/50 chance he'll go along with us at least that far. What can he lose? Rather take a chance with him than with that Kelly dame, huh? Ok. The water will be boiling in a minute. Then we'll have the coffee, huh? Why are you stalling? What do you mean, stalling? Why can't I talk to them? I told you, you'll talk to them later. Are they dead? Listen to me and pay attention. As long as you do as you're told, they stay alive. You understand that? How do I know that you haven't killed them? Now, you listen to me, because I'm not going to do anything you tell me to do, anything at all- shh! Wait a minute. Now, listen. You want to talk to them? Huh? You be quiet. You make noise, I promise you, you won't talk to anybody. Understand? Relax. Take it easy. Want to see if that's the paper, please? Thank you. Now remember, Pat, if you talk to your mother on the telephone, don't say anything about our being saved. Because this man, the bad man that took your mommy, he might be listening, and we don't want- ok, Vince. Go on! Answer it! Now, you watch it. Hello. Hello, Vince. Listen, how's everything? I want to talk to my husband. All right. Look, I said you be quiet. We made a deal. You can talk. Talk. Hello. Hello. Your wife. Darling? Darling? Oh, Jim. Jim, darling, you're all right. Oh, it's wonderful to hear your voice. How are you? Are you all right? Where are you? I don't know where I am. He made me wear those taped glasses again. Jim... Jim, I don't know how long he's going to let me talk. Will you put Pat on, please? Yeah. She's right here. Mommy! Mommy! Pat. Pat, how are you? Are they treating you well? Are you feeling all right? Fine, mommy. What are they giving you to eat? Hot dogs and lots of ice cream. Oh, mommy, I miss you. When are you coming back? Very soon, darling. Mommy! What's the matter? What's happening? Joan, what's the matter? Jim. Jim, I'm so very happy. Jim, I love you very much. I love you and Pat very much. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. If anything happens to me, remember I love you very much. No! They're hurting mommy! They're hurting mommy! Daddy, don't let them hurt mommy! Go, huh? No, no, no. It's all right, honey. It's all right, honey. You still have a chance to save this woman's life. Time's running out fast. You didn't say anything in the bank? No? You're sure? Aah! Aah! Think they got anything on that call? I'll check. I need a cigarette. If anyone moves, even a muscle, this goes into his gut! Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Goes through a person's body so fast, he can't even feel it, right? Uh! Take it easy, Molner. I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him. Where is she? 6 barrow street, second floor. Hello. We got it. 6 barrow street, second floor. Get there as quickly as you can. There's a man after me! He's going to kill me! Call the police! Please, call the police! Stop! Stop! There's a woman down there in the subway. A man's after her with a gun. She's trying to escape along the tube going that way. You cover the tube from here. We'll work back from the next station. Uh! Oh! There's a woman down there in the subway! We heard a scream. I think she's up there in the tunnel. Don't go down there! There's a train due! You're going to be killed!
