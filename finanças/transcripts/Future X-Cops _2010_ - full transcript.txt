A City in 2080. Year 2080. This year is the 10th anniversary of Dr. Masterson's invention: Solar Canopy. 70% of the world population... do not have to worry about energy crisis anymore. With this Solar Canopy, mankind has more than enough supply of clean energy. Our environment is better protected. Today, the Father of Solar Energy, Dr. Masterson, will be present at the exhibition of... Unearthed Relics of the Tang Dynasty" as the officiating guest. ls the intelligence confirmed? lt's been confirmed and re-confirmed. But we still lack the details. Our intelligence is confirmed. The terrorists have hired professional hitmen. They plan to assassinate Dr. Masterson at the exhibition hall today. Dr. Masterson has deprived many energy merchants of their business opportunities. lt is not surprising they want to kill him. This time the hitmen are cyborgs. Thank you! lt's disgusting! They look like insects. All of you should understand. This mission is dangerous. You guys must be more careful. Get your armouries. Before the exhibition starts, find an advantageous base of operation. Yes, sir. Millie. You'd better go home to take care of our daughter. Why? Whenever we are given a dangerous mission, why do you always leave me out? Why do you always go on the mission without me? Do you know how l feel waiting for you at home? l am scared! l am afraid that my husband's name would appear on the casualty list. l know... Do you know how worried l am when you are on a mission? Let me go with you. Whenever I am with my loved one, l become inarticulate, l don't know why. We will be fine. Our daughter will be fine. So, take care of yourself, will you? Take care. l am leaving now. We will enter the exhibition hall 30 seconds later. Tell everybody... security level is raised. Got it. Now l declare... the "Unearthed Relics of the Tang Dynasty" exhibition is now opened. May we have Dr. Masterson to officiate the ribbon cutting ceremony for us? Milllie, protect Dr. Masterson! Mayor, please retreat. Get ready to fight! Fire! Run now! Follow me! Go quickly! Millie! Kapo! Run now! Don't move! Millie... Forward now. Stop him! Kiki, put your socks on! Put your socks on! No, l don't want to put on my socks. But without your socks, you'll get sick. No, l don't want to. l am angry now. Hurry up... l am not putting my socks on. Hit me then! Kiki! Let me warn you, l'm gonna hit you now! l'll spank you! What's going on? Why don't you learn to put on your socks? You'll get sick! Please, no! Please! Put it on yourself. Why... do you need your mom to put on your socks for you? Why do you run in your bare feet? Why are you so stupid? l won't let you eat it. I'll give it to mom. Your dad says you are naughty. Mom, you eat it! Come on... lt's fake. Of course it is fake! Do you think I'll let you eat the real thing? Disgusting! Help me! Come on! lt hurts! You're bad! Kiki, come and help me. Don't bully mummy! Hit your dad! Hit him! l know you will be here. l proposed to her right here. What happened to your wife, we are very sorry. Someone stole the confidential files about Time Travel developed by many countries. Time Travel? How far can one go back through Time Travel? Almost a century ago. Who stole it? Most probably those who tried to assassinate Dr. Masterson. l suppose they want to go back in time... to kill the teenage Dr. Masterson. So, this can change history. l need to increase my power. After this operation, you will become the most powerful cyborg in the world. You will possess... all the merits of the robot army. You will have no weaknesses. No! lf you do that, only the head and the heart are mine. Can l still say l am human? This mission needs a very special man. lf you don't have guts, you can back out now. No! l'll do it. Kalon. Shut up. l will not change my mind. Then please operate on me too. l want to stay with you even if we are going to die. Have a good hug now. l am afraid that this will be your last hug... before you part with your present body! Dr. Masterson, how old were you then? l was twelve. lf you want me to go back in time, You must do what I ask of you. You can't delete my memory. 2020. The same city. K.W. Foster, you fail your composition test again. You should read Kiki's composition. Her composition's title is "My father". A few teachers and i are deeply moved! But my father hasn't come home for 9 months. What can I write about him? So, you just hand in a blank paper. l can't even remember my father's looks. Nonsense! Go stand outside the classroom, now! Okay... My father is a traffic policeman. He rides a motorcycle and patrols the streets everyday. He says hello to citizens with a smile. Under the scorching sun, he still serves the citizens and maintains law and order, though he sweats profusely every day patrolling the streets. Dad said, policemen are civil servants. The safety of citizens... lies in the hands of the police. Doctor, have you brought your camera with you? Of course, you know I love taking pictures of insects. May I borrow it? Don't you need me to help you with your homework today? lf you don't do your homework, you will be punished tomorrow. Let's do it some other day. l have something important to do today. What sort of naughty ideas do you have in mind? Kiki protrays his dad as a super hero. l don't believe her. l want to tail her. Perhaps, her dad is an obese man. He is so fat that he may have difficulty climbing on his bike. So what? l want to film it. And let everyone in school watch it and laugh at Kiki! l just hate her guts in school! Hi, Miss Holly! Kiki, why don't you go home after school? Dad said he'll come here to meet me at four o.clock. He will then give me money to buy food. Take a close-up of her, otherwise, how do people know who she is? Shut up! What do you know? Miss Holly! i cannot contact Misfortune. You fool! Yesterday he told me there will be a robbery here today. He will contact us at the scene. Where the hell is he now? l am right here. Why did you hide here? Safety first. l have been an undercover cop for 6 years. l would have been killed if I wasn't discreet. Where are the robbers? They would come at 3:50. At the entrance of the jewellery shop. l am the lookout. 3:50? lt's almost 4 o'clock now. That's not possible! My watch is always correct. My girlfriend gives it to me. Who is this kiddy? Kidd's daughter. My name is Kiki, not kiddy. You have a sharp tongue, sharper than your dad. Kidd is not an articulate man! My father is honest, not inarticulate. You, Misfortune, are dumb. Kiki, this is Mr. Jing. He is our buddy, so we greet him by his nickname. So Mr. Jing is Misfortune! l am going to get out. Remember the password? Sure l do. Ha... Miss Holly, he is notorious for being forgetful. Can he remember the password? Yes, he does. The password is "Ha...". Why haven't the three robbers come? Boss, you look pretty in a woman's dress. l can't imagine that a fool like you can be an undercover! An undercover cop? How can I be an undercover cop? Do you want to signal the police? Let's see how you do it now! Follow me! Come on! Kiki, don't stay here! Go and wait for your father by the road side. Remember, if something happens, just hide somewhere immediately. Got it? See you! See you! Dad! Come and help me now! Are you okay? l am fine. Did anyone see me? No. See how clumsy her father is! lf we put this video clip on the internet, Kiki will want to dig a hole to hide herself. That's right! Robbery! Get out of my way! On the floor! Get out of my way... Don't come over. Stop! Let the hostage go! You can't get away! Dad! Let... me go! Call the B team to back us up! Hurry up! Yes! Don't let them get away! Let's follow them! I am sure there will be more. That's right... Run! Hurry up! Why are there two Kidd Zhao? l am just your illusion. My illusion? That's right... Ghost! Super---man! There is no ghost in this world. lt's just an illusion. How about me? Am I an illusion or a ghost? You are an illusory ghost! Don't jump! l won't be able to catch you! You... Are we dreaming? Kiki's father is a Superman cop! Kidd, are you alright? He won't die. Kiki. Miss Holly... What happened? l don't know. What has happened? l don't know, either. i fainted. lt's weird! What torment! You have asked me many many times, lady! l'll ask one more time. One more time. Alright. Come on. Today, two of us went to the rooftop. They didn't beat me. But I fainted. When l woke up, those three guys were lying on the floor. Why? Well, l suppose they had an infighting and injured themselves. Do you understand? Yes. Come on, eat. Eat! Hey... l beg you, don't question me any more, please! Lady! All right, eat. Eat. My goodness! He is truly the Superman! Super cool! Shall we upload that on the internet? Of course not! Why? lf everyone knows Kiki's father is Superman, we won't have any chance! What chance? To be his disciple! Ask him to teach us! Ask him to teach us? Of course. Think! lf we were like him, say, if we can jump that high, we can certainly win a gold medal in the 2024 Olympics. That's right! Why didn't I think of that? You're dumb! Mom! Your mom is so young! How could she have given birth to you? She is my step-mother. My mom died giving birth to me. But she is nice to me. She looks very sad now. My dad hasn't come home for 9 months. My mom always looks sad these days. There are news that many people commited suicide recently. How can you say this? You moron! lt's time for dinner. l don't want to eat. I have no appetite. What's the matter? lf people think you are insane and tie you up, Will you be happy? Let me make you happy! How? l'll use both of my hands... to make you happy. l don't want a massage. I don't like to be tickled. So, I have to double my effort! l'll use both of my hands... and my tongue. To make you happy! ls that true? Of course it is true. Good! Are you ready? Are you happy now? Excuse me. So, I'll go now! Get me out of here as soon as possible! They treat me as an insane patient. lt's you who told the doctor that... Kidd Zhao became Superman yesterday. He overcame those three robbers in a fight, right? Right! He said that was only my illusion. Then l fainted. Was that your illusion? How can that be? You have read the report. Didn't the three of them say the same thing? Were all four of us having the same illusion? Can Kidd Zhao possibly be Superman? That's impossible. But... Misfortune, let me tell you, even if I have rejected your courting... even if I...l am fond of him... You should not bear false witness against him. lf l lied, l will forgo my name Misfortune. Call me Mishap for life, okay? Anyway, be careful about what you say. Or, I won't let you off the hook lightly. You know what? The three robbers said, Kidd Zhao is Superman, did you hear that? Yes, l did. Are they now in hospital? Yes. l used the lie detector on them. They didn't lie. So, you believe Kidd is Superman? Of course... not! There is something wrong with the lie detector. But, our undercover Misfortune said the same thing. So, I can't help getting suspicious. Misfortune had been held hostage and he was stabbed. l think he's got "Post-traumatic stress disorder". The doctor said that he gave a very detailed account of what happened. And that Kidd had told him he is imagining things. What actually happened yesterday? l have written a very detailed report. l have read every detail in your report. But I found out that he was out of your sight for a short interval. What happened during that interval? l only have Kidd's statement. During that interval, Kidd and his daughter were held hostage on the rooftop. We dared not stay too close. About one minute later, we got there after hearing a gun shot. During that minute when you didn.t see what happened, the three robbers and Misfortune claimed that... Kidd suddenly turned into Superman. Let's go. Where? Let's go see our Superman. Kidd Zhao! Looking for me? l am looking for Superman. What Superman? Someone said you're Superman. Who said so? The three robbers who fought among themselves. What did you do to them? l didn't do anything! l felt strange that they repeatedly hit my fist with their faces. That hurts a lot. Someone was hit! Why do you laugh? l thought you'll take pity on him. Bull shit! lf you were Superman, you could go catch all the bad guys. We can have an easy time. Come here... Let me tell you the truth. Actually l am Batman. You've got a sense of humor! No wonder Holly... cares so much about you. Come on! Do you want me to tell everyone how you propose to your exgirlfriend? l give up. Don't! Say anything about me but not this. What is it about? Nothing! Mr. Batman, see you then. Bye. He is very busy! Let me tell you. What? His ex-girlfriend is my classmate. You know how awfully he sings? No. l don't know. His singing is horrible! Absolute nightmare! lt was Pinky's birthday. He proposed to her. We forced him to sing the song Love you for ten thousand years. You can't imagine how awfully he sang it. l don't know who is worse, him or the original singer. But he dared to sing the whole song. My classmate couldn't help crying. She agreed to marry him. Marry him? Yes! So, what happened next? Easy come, easy go. They broke up not long after the engagement. Since then, He hasn't fallen in love again. He is a very nice man. l hope he can find a better woman than your classmate. You too. Of course. Oh my goodness! She likes me. My goodness! You can't fall in love with anyone in 2020. That will change history. We don't want history to be changed. Come back at once when the mission is accomplished. You must not stay there and become part of history. And, never disclose your identity. That may alarm the assassins. That may endanger your mission to protect young Dr. Masterson. Be careful when you cross the road. What's the matter? Sorry... Master! We have met you at last! Why do you two wait here for me? lt's because we find out you are Superman! We won't tell others. But you must take us as your disciples. What did you say? Do you think we are talking nonsense? Are you two paparazzi? Why did you film me in secret? That is accidental. lt won't make a difference even if you destroy this disk. We have made dozens of copies. Dozens of copies? Does anyone else see it? Up to this second, only the three of us have seen it. lf you don't agree to teach us, this disk will be sent to all television stations. Are you two blackmailing me? Master, don't misunderstand us. We want to learn from you. Teach us how to be Superman junior. Get up. We want to have your superpower... to help the weak and to fight crime. Get up. lf you won't teach us, we won't get up. Alright. You have witnessed my superpower. Perhaps we are destined to be... teacher and students. But, in order to become my students, you must follow one rule. lf not, l will puncture your acupuncture point of Oaf. lt will then delete everything you have learnt. What is the rule? Never let anyone know we are supermen. Of course. From today onwards, You will become Superman 2 and Superman 3. Disgusting! You'll have to buy me a new car. Don't kill us! My things are very valuable and expensive. Just take anything you want. Yes, our furniture is designer made. Take anything you like with you. Hubby! This fool is a surgeon! ln what year is today? December 3rd. l ask you in what year is today? Today is December 3, 2020. December 3, 2020. We came from the second Universe Crevice. The first Universe Crevice is in the year 2018. l wonder from which Crevice he would come! lf he came from the first Crevice, then he had arrived 2 years ago. l really hope that... he is the cop who killed my brother... Kidd Zhao! l want to torture him as much as possible... to avenge my brother's death. Hubby, don't worry. Once we know where Dr. Masterson is, we will get him. lt is great! School is over! Goodbye, Miss! Ten Thousand Buddhas' Facing Home! What are you two doing? Kiki, stop pretending. Your dad taught us martial arts. Your dad is our master. You must have learnt this from him. From now on, we are family. My dad taught you two... this? You must be lying! She doesn't know the secret! Poor girl! She doesn't know anything about her dad. Let's go! Don't talk to her right here. Go... You lied. l have nothing to say... Nothing to say! Stop following me! Stop! Help them out. What's up? Miss Holly. What's the matter? When the three robbers were sent to the hospital today for a medical checkup, they kept saying that Superman beat them up. The reporters heard about it and came over. What'd we do then? The paparazzi are everywhere. You'd better be careful. l will. Sergeant Masterson wants to see you. l've got tons of enquiries asking me what had happened. l think you'd better stay here. l agree. l hope no one would believe the robbers. Anyway, they don't have any chance to talk to the press. But I am afraid that someone will still say that he is Superman. Then I just don't know what to say. No. lt won't. Let me tell you definitely. This is the last one. What's the matter? Sorry, Sergeant. Kidd Zhao, a kid calls you on the phone. He wants to tell you that his mother is going to commit suicide. He wants you to go as Superman to rescue his mom. What kid? He says he is Kidd's disciple. He is Superman 2. His name is K. W. Foster. Put him through, please. Let me talk to him! Yes, sir. Master, this is K.W speaking. My mom, to be exact, my step-mother, she is now sitting on the balcony and says she is going to jump. She said my dad asked for a divorce. My dad wants to leave her and me. What you taught me is of no use. Please come and save her! lt's tall... lt's too dangerous for her to sit there. Where is the rescue team? They are on the way. They can't make it in time. l'll do it myself. Sergeant, you haven't gone on a mission for one whole year. l'll go with you. Wait for me right here. l will go up by myself. The press are here. They see you! Go back to the building. Persuade the woman to go back to the apartment. l'll go down from above. You go distract her. Let's go! You two, set the block further back. Yes, madam. Tell the firemen to get the air cushion ready as soon as possible. Yes, madam. Mom! Please don't jump. You must hang on! Wait for me! Please calm down! My mom is sitting on the balcony and says she is going to jump. Master, come in! Quick! Master Superman is here to help you! Don't jump! Or, I will jump! Don't come over! Okay, we won't come near you. Ladies and gentlemen! This is a live broadcast of the legendary police Superman, Kidd Zhao... He is trying to persuade a woman to give up committing double suicide. Let's see whether he can accomplish this mission or not. lt's dangerous! Sergeant, this is too high. Can we wait for the rescue team? They can't make it in time. I've got to do it myself. That's impossible! How can a man... want to divorce a pretty wife like you? How can he leave such a smart kid? l am sure he will regret it after a week. But my dad hasn't come home for nine months. l am sure he will regret it after nine months. l wait for him until all my money is gone. l keep telling myself that he will come back one day. But at long last, all i've got is a request for divorce. Tell me, what else can l do? I am going to kill myself! Don't cry... Look! You're so pretty and young. Many men... many men will want to love you. Will you love me? l... I am not ... Answer me now. l just take it as an example. Just for example. Right? You men... Men are all liars. They never mean what they say. No one is trustworthy. l will never trust men again! Hey, what are you doing? Hey... Mom, please don't... Please don't, okay? Stop... Don't do that. It is dangerous! You know many people love you. You lied! No one loves me. None! Not even one man! Yes, one man does love you. l love you. You are lying! No, if you say YES, I'll marry you at once. I am single. Let's get married early tomorrow morning. Why do you want to marry me? Why? Love at first sight. My husband sang me a song when he proposed to me. l was deeply moved and married him. Will you sing me a song now? But I... can't sing. lf a man really loves a woman, he will do anything for her. He will sing to her. Do you know his singing is very awful? l don't know. His singing is truly awful! l love you for ten thousand years. My love is durable... Sergeant Masterson! What are you doing? The rescue team used every means... to rescue the woman. lncluding singing. Though he doesn't sing well, but we should appreciate his efforts. My love is durable. lt stands the test of time. This love draws us together, tightly together. l love you for ten thousand... What are you doing? Mom! Bravo! She is safe now... Bravo! Help! Go up! Hurry up! Are you okay? l am fine, thank you. Are you okay? Who are you? Let me take a look... Who are you? lt's me. l am sorry... l am really worried about you. How about now? l am not worried now. Did you see me? Dad rescued the woman. it's great. lt is very dangerous. l really am in danger! How can Superman be in danger? What's the matter with you? How can a smart girl like you believe what they say? But why do so many people say you're Superman? Dad. Why didn't you tell me our past? You didn't even tell me anything about mom. You just said she died, but how? l haven't even seen any photo of her. Answer me. Don't you believe in me, your dad? No. I don't. You'd rather believe what those fools out there said about me. But you don't believe me, right? So, why do you teach Foster and Doctor weird 'martial arts'? lt's because they're stupid. They won't listen to me. So l cheat them. Dad, I think you are cheating me too. Why should I cheat my own daughter? l... Someone is coming. l don't want others see you cry. May I? Don't cry. Smile. l know you have not eaten tonight. Kiki, a pretty girl is here for you. Hi. Hi, this is night snack. l am not hungry. ln fact, l don't know what hunger is. Hey. You two having a quarrel? l don't know. Girls of this age have weird thoughts. You are a single parent. You should try harder to understand her feelings. Come on, you eat first! I'll go talk to her. The doctor said you have a shock. You'll be fine after one or two days' rest. Can you stay and keep me company? Sure. My name is Sue. l am Masterson! Nice to know you. ls it sweet? lt's very sweet! Are you the son of the woman who was saved tonight? Yes. Bravo! Can i have an interview with you? ln Talent lnternational School, there are three students named Masterson. But they are all girls. ls he studying in some other school? But he donated a new building to the school in the year 2078. He said his mother school is Talent lnternational School. lf he didn't study there, why did he say that's his mother school? He graduated in 2021 . So he should be a primary six student now. Can he be a transfer student? Let's ask some students in that school. Good idea. He is Superman, of course. l am his disciple. And, his daughter Kiki is my classmate. He has a daughter? We need some help. lt's cold! Yeah, it's cold. Shouldn't you give me yourjacket? You want my jacket? We are both adults. What are you thinking? You know l love you. Why do you always avoid me? ls there another woman you're in love with? You always pretend to cough whenever l raise this question. ln fact... l can't get over Kiki's mom. Kidd, I really like you... A man as loyal to love as you... is an endangered species. l will help you to forget her. l will wait until you only care for me. l don't have time. Bullshit! You are still young. See, a taxi is coming. You'd better go home. l'll call you and we can talk. l don't want to go home. Why? l want to be with you. Why do you push me away? Sorry! Please go! l don't want to go. l have my reasons for saying no. l'll tell you later. Tell me now. lt's not convenient. Maybe next month... Not convenient? Next month? Are you a woman? l don't want to argue with you. Please go now. l am not going. Are you sure? l am sure. lf you won't go, l'll go. Go! Don't you want to go? This food is nice. Why don't you eat it? Why don't you go back to your mom's place? My mom is having a good time with her lover. Why should l go to her? How come you three were released? You are released but i am tied up. lt's not fair! What do you want? Let me go! Misfortune! Help me! Let me go! All of you freeze! Miss Holly. Hands up! Do you know Robert Masterson? Dr. Masterson? Dr. Masterson? No. We don't know him. l have a classmate nicknamed Doctor. Are you the disciple of Kidd Zhao? That's correct. Do as I said. Re-make all three of them. l don't have the necessary materials at home. Use whatever you have. Are you two Kidd's friends? l am not. l am. lf you are not his friend, You are his enemy. OK! We are friends. Then I'll re-make you too. l don't want to... please don't! Look at you! You'll look better after the re-make. Go ahead! How about just double-fold eyelids? Dad. We are not on good terms yet. Have you found them? The speed of internet sixty years ago is too slow! lt takes me two minutes... to hack into their traffic system's surveillance network. Now, I can see where they are going. Once they disembark, we'll go over there. Dad! Kiki, go call the police. Why? Be good, go now! Dad! Save me! Let me go... Run! Quick! Run! Help! Wow, Monster! Wow, Superman! l am the Future X-Cop! He is fantastic! Future X-Cop! You've finally come. The thermo detector can't locate Fiona and me. Our body temperature is lower than a snake's. lf you want to save your woman and the kid, come in. Bravo! l'll talk straight with you. Tell me where Dr. Masterson is. Then I'll let your woman and the kid go. l never bargain with terrorists. But let me tell you, you've got it all wrong. Dr. Masterson isn't in this age. l've tried to find him for two years but failed. Do you think I will believe you? l don't care if you believe me or not. lf you are a man, let the three of them go. No, not three, but four. Don.t forget we also have Misfortune. l am here! What'd l become hereafter? Brother! Don't panic. This is nice. l can change channel when I am tired of your face. Shut up, you kid! Let me tell you! lf I press this remote control, your woman will be burnt to ashes. Weapons of sixty years ago are primitive. But they can still kill your woman... l assure you they still work. Don't worry about me, Kidd! She is willing to sacrifice herself for you! You must love her very much. Answer me. Yes, I love her very much. l'll tell you! lf you kill her, you will never find Dr. Masterson all your life. Run, K.W., hurry! Get them out of here safely! Got it. You take care of yourself. You guys, run! Master, be careful! Dad! Dad! You really are Superman! Cool! Why didn't you tell me earlier? Calm down... Go with Miss Holly. Hurry up! Sergeant Masterson... Where did you get these clothes? They gave it to me. For the rest, l'll tell you later. He really is Superman! What'd l do then? Don't worry! My master will change you back. Mayor's Office The authorities have read the report you submitted. Apparently, they accept your explanation. They hope you can stay and help solve some scientific problems for us. No problem. They don't want to alarm the citizens and cause panic. So, you must be very discreet. Sure. Sorry... You ancient people are weird. You always apologize. It is so annoying! Where is the Sergeant? l suppose he is making preparations for his wedding now. So fast? Yeah! How about us? l am just kidding. Don't take me seriously! l may leave one month from now. What if i am willing to love you for one month only? l... I am afraid... you'll suffer. No, l'll be happy. So pretty! Right. Unfortunately you'll have to leave soon. Sorry... lt's a deal. We'll love each other for one month. And then, we'll remember the bliss of that month... for our whole life! What a pity we still can't find Dr. Masterson. Maybe l've got the wrong information. Where is Misfortune? Is he here? He is transferred to the Special Force Unit. He is a captain now, really cool! Hello? Boss, I am behind you. l have to go out for a while. What? You come to pick me up? We must take you to the right location and teleport you back to 2080. Time? About two hours later. Make good use of your time here! Your girlfriend is pretty. You are pretty too. So, I better go look for a handsome boyfriend. Sure. Master... Kiki told me that you two will leave soon, right? What.s up? That's right. When we are back, don't just think of me. Study hard. Honour your dad and mom. When we are back, we will send you email. l hate to think of what will happen tomorrow. Why? l have to change my name on my identity card. Who did it for you? My mom did it. i like it very much. From now on, l have to embroider "K.W." on all my shirts. K.W. is the initial of Kam Wah. Do you have a Christian name? Yes, my dad just gives me one today. lt is Robert, Robert K.W. Masterson. Do you think it's cool? Robert K.W. Masterson? Master, what's the matter? Nothing. l will miss you. After we left, you must work very very hard in your studies. You must remember, there is only technology in this world. There is no Superman. lf you have any new idea, just speak out. Do you understand me? l do. Can i see you again? We may meet again. Sure, l promise we will meet again. What happen? Run! Run! Run now! Quick! Call the Special Force for back up now! Run! Alright. Stay behind me. What's happened? Stay behind me! Quick! On the floor! Protect K.W. Foster! Run. Run, this way! this way! Hide in there. Hurry up! Hey! Over here! Jump down! Quick! Come with me!
