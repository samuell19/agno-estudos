It might help you unwind after a hard day's work? I'm okay, But If you dont mind i would like to taking a shower before I head out ... Now really i don't see why you don't see why you just move into the guest room. Well, for one thing, my girlfriend would kill me. laughter.....

I don't think it worked. I don't think it did ether. Where going to have to face it, the occasional handyman isn't going to cut it anymore. Where going to make a major commitment. You mean ...? Where going to have to claimed our mates. What about Henry? I don't know about you, but I could go for some steak tartar.. SO, this the place? Yep, according to the online ad and Map-Buddy. You want to see the print-out? No. Man, I don't know about this. Looks like some swanky digs. What?!? This whole thing was your idea! Yeah, but I thought it would be more low-rent than this. Rufus, Don't tell me your chickening out. I'm not chickening out, okay? I'm being cautious. Its the same thing. We still have time to apply down at The Bronko Burger ... Guys, we're not working some lame fast food job! Ok... How are we going to be popular if we're just flipping burgers?!? Dude where not popular... Right, Coopersmith. We're not popular. COOPERSMITH Huh.... Like you said, Ok this was my idea. But look at This place man.. I mean, these ladies have to be rich right? So? So? They can hire anybody they want. As in "professionals.

Wiping up after some old ladys doesn't sound all We're right at their front door and you guys just want to go home? Ya and now that you're pointing that out, We are at their front door so we should probably... Shut up, Darwin. What's the worst that can happen? They can say "no. Ya they can say "no.But whats happen if we leave here and dont do any thing at all? Well I have to have to move back in with my parents 'til fall. Right again.

Charles Coopersmith. Why Mister Charles Coopersmith. What brings you to my door? And who are your friends? Im Rufus. And I'm Darwin. Uh, "Milo Darwin. I see ... Umm Well, we're here -- uh, the three of us We're here about the ad you posted online? The one looking for college students to work here for the summer? Oh,The ad! Well, you're so lucky! You're the first of the applicants to arrive! Great! Do we get our own rooms? Well we will see about that. I would like you to meet my sisters. Sisters? Mhhmm... Such handsome boys! Uh ... thanks. Ohh, gracious me, where are my manners? These are my two lovely sisters... They call this one "Victoria" ... ... and this one "Edwina". Hi... It's a pleasure to meet all three of you. Quite. Please, have something to drink! Uh ... thanks ... I'm thirsty ... That's an interesting necklace. Well, thank you.Ohh It's been in the family for generations. You boys look a little nervous. We're fine. Really. Are you a virgin to all this? Uh ... excuse me? What my sister so eloquently meant to say was, "Are you new to living away from home?". Yes. Of course. That's what I meant. Oh, well.. Ya you know,we're college students. So we still live on campus? Ya We're all sophomores at the university. I mean, we will be. We're all kind of looking for summer jobs.. And we're hiring.. Yes, we ate our last one ... Please bear with us, gentlemen. I'm afraid the three of us have a reputation for being a little on the eccentric side. You join one witches' coven ... Ohhh, the Eighties That's a joke, fellas. It's ok to laugh. A joke... Right... Well I think its time to probably ask the usuall questions. Do you smoke? Nope. Smoking is bad for you. Smoking cigarettes is bad for you. Lots of friends? A girlfriend? Lots of girlfriends? We're, kinda in the middle of girlfriends right now. You like what you've see? Huh? Do you like the place? Um ... yes. It's very nice. It's um, kind of reminds me of home. You know, if my home was a mansion in Malibu ... We have three job openings, which is perfect for you gentlemen. We're looking for a full-time pool maintenance man, a cook and a personal masseuse. But we expect all three of you to perform house-cleaning duties, landscaping ... Bartending ... No problem. Well if there are no more questions, I think it's safe to say, that you are hired! They get my vote. Absolutely. Wow. Really? We brought resumes' ... I didn't. Shouldn't we fill out an application or a W-Two form.? I think a handshake will do nicely. We'll pay you in cash, of course. No need to get the government involved ... There's a catch, right? No catch. By the way,Um which one of you is the cook? Ummmm.. Ohh Crap...Great! It's me! This is the dining room. Breakfast is at Ten, and dinner around Seven.. And the occasional brunch. Don't worry; we're easy to cook for. No filet mignon or foie gras. And no junk food. We're watching our figures. Ka! We don't each much ...dinner. Pardon me for asking ... You three are single? Who needs husbands when you have ex-husbands? Or can hire three young tasty morsels like yourselves? What my sister means to say is that, we do enjoy the company. Its just that we can be a little boring, I mean we came to a place in life where we are just three old spinsters. You? Spinsters? Well, we're not dead yet, Its just we enjoy are peace and quiet. See we grew up overseas, on an isolated estate in South America. We ... prefer our own company. Excluding the three of you, of course. Besides, if we get bored, we can always order take out. Darwin... What the hell, Rufus?!? You were having a nightmare ... Yeah. I was having a nightmare. What are you doing in my room? We got a problem. Gee, you think? You know,it's a good thing i took home ec high school otherwise, I wouldn't have known how to make the veal Parmesan I had to make last night ... Yeah, and it was delicious ok.. Back to me: I don't know anything about being a "personal masseuse. Let me recap. You two drafted me as the cook.. I am not a cook. Im not a cook.. If you wanted me to be the masseuse guy somebody else should have taken the chef job. I don't know how to cook, either! You two wanted a "fun summer job, It's not my fault if you don't have any marketable skills.. So, what am I supposed to do? Well have you ever given somebody a massage before? No ... Go ahead take off your shirt. I'll show you how.. All right,,,Feel that? You have to find out where they're most ,tense then knead the muscles to get the oxygen flowing ... This feels pretty good! Hey, I wanted to ask you something. You notice that necklace Clara was wearing? Could you get my neck while you're back there? I'm being serious! I know I've seen that necklace before. I wasn't paying attention.I mean Did you see those women?!? I was kind of preoccupied with what they weren't wearing, so, no, I didn't notice any necklace. Okay, fine. Hey, Seriously, man, if you want out of this, just quit. Ka, Coopersmith and I can handle it. Coopersmith won't "handle it and you know it. Okay, I'll handle it. Just don't stay here if you don't want to. It's not that ... Its just there's something weird about all this.You know we get the job right off the bat? We're getting free room and board, great pay, these women are extremely hot and They didn't even asks for references? I mean something about this doesn't any of this seem a little off to you Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Speaking of Coopersmith, how's he handling his new job Are you kidding me? He's never been around a swimming pool In his entire life... I guess you will be next Mr. Coopersmith ... I'm ready for your massage ... Really? You're quite overdressed. Overdressed? Yes. I like my masseuses to show a little more skin. It's a trust issue. The more you show, the more I feel comfortable showing. Please, go change into something a little more trustworthy In fact, when I get back, I expect that shirt to be gone. Which one of us is getting the massage here?!? Great! Now, I'm hearing things! Whoa, what's your problem?!? Being the pool cleaner sucks! Yeah, that's why I took the masseuse job. Well, I want to trade. No way, Jose'. That girl Edwina is making me strip down for her massage. Dammit! Hey, man, this was your idea ... Ya, i wanted to work here all summer for three hot ladies. Not get sunburnt by the pool all day.. Looks like your massage is getting postponed. Maybe he's the pizza delivery guy? Ya, he's delivering something, all right. Don't rub off your bad karma on me.I was having a great morning. Hello!!! Are you ... Clara ? Are you breakfast? I've been every meal in the book. But you can call me "AnsonMam. I like your manners. I try. Should I come in? Well if we're going to come in your going to have to loose about ninety percent of that outfit. See we like to just cut right to the chase here. "We? Me and my sisters and I hope you've been taking your vitamins Oh, I come prepared for any situation ... One bed? I like how you women think. Time to sleep ... Is he ready? He seems to be. We should be sure. We only have a few more days, and "being sure" will be least of are problems. Girls? Can we save the dramatics for later? Ka.. Light the candle. By Ba'al and by Carthin, I call to thee. By Legba by Zuul, I pledge my life to thee, sweet Kala-bast The goddess in all of us... I pledge my life for thee, sweet Kala-bast ... Within this candle's flame, let the spirit of thy servant flow . Let the spirit of thy servant flow ... The powder ... Let this powder be as your ashes, the dust of thy servant's flesh ... Thy servant's flesh ... Thy servant's flesh ... The oil ... And with the sacred oil let it be as your blood.. let it flow over you, give us eternity ... GRANT US ETERNITY!!! GRANT US ETERNITY!!! It worked. Ohh, Such a handsome boy. Too bad he was such a jerk.. The others should be ready soon enough. We have one small problem. Which is? Our chosen ones must come to us of their own free will. We need to step up the game. In a few more days, Kala-bast will no longer show favor on us. They can surely be persuaded. And we can surely persuade them. Talk later. Eat now ... As you can see, I changed my wardrobe. Are you ready for your massage? Put your shirt back on. I need you to run a quick errand for me.. Okay ... Those are the keys to Anson's car. You're talking about the guy who showed up here a little while ago, right? Wow, smart and pretty. Yes. I'm afraid he had a little bit too much to drink and had to take a cab home. What I need you to do is, drive his car to the public parking lot next to the Belasco Bank building downtown. Leave the keys in the ignition and his car unlocked. I'll call him and let him know you delivered it. But ... Trust me, he'll pick it up as soon as you get there. do it myself, but ...... I just painted my nails. You understand. How do I get back? You need change for the bus? No ... I should be okay ... Thank you, Rufus. You're a doll. You can oil me up when you get back. I was listening from the kitchen. This doesn't strike you as a little off? Man, who knows? Maybe he was their dealer or something? I think he was a gigolo. A ... what?!? I think they hired somebody for sex. Thats why they got us right? Right. That's why I think they hired somebody for sex. Also, I have a really good view of the front drive from the kitchen. I haven't seen a cab all Morning. Maybe he walked? Or maybe they chopped him up into little bits and hid him in the basement. This place doesn't have a basement. Look, I'm just saying, Things are getting weirder by the minute. Ya whatever, Man, I got things to do. Like I keep saying: don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Gift horses don't eat people ...! Coopersmith? You okay? Coopersmith! Hey wake up! Yes, Coopersmith ... Come to mama.... We're ready for you, Coopersmith. Eww.... He's almost too good to waste ... Maybe we can keep him ... As a pet. What's happening ...? How did I get here? I sent for you, Don't you remember? No. Well your here. I dont remember.. Mhhhm.. Dont you ever think about you, me and my sisters? We want you to stay, Coopersmith. What's going on here? We want to play with you, Coopersmith. But you have to want it. You have to ask for it. Really ask for it ... Ohhh.. Please? Put your hands on them Coopersmith. That's right, Coopersmith ... just relax ... I... I.... This is,, This is to weird for me.... Don't just touch me and walk away! We want a little steak with are sizzle. We want to play! Just say "yes! I shouldn't be going ... I dont think you will be leaving soon... CLARA Time to sleep ... You should have let us have our fun with you Coopersmith. Then you would have gone out with a smile ... Light the candle. By Ba'al and by Carthis, I call upon thee. By Legba and by Zuul, I pledge my life for thee, sweet Kala-bast, our goddess of us all ... I pledge my life for thee, sweet Kala-bast our goddess ... Within this candle's flame, let the spirit of thy servant flow. Let the spirit of thy servant flow ... The powder ... Let this powder be as your ashes, The dust of thy servant's flesh ... Thy servant's flesh ... The oil ... And let this sacred oil be as your blood ... let it pump over you,and give us eternity ... GIVE US ETERNITY!!! GIVE US ETERNITY!!! And Now, we have to move faster. Kala-bast has become impatient. And you don't want to see an angry goddess ... The other two will be harder to convince. The solstice is too close. The time for subtlety is over. I want our mates ready for the final ritual. How? Without anybody suspecting? That's the least of our worries. Nobody will come looking for the boys until it's too late. Lets get to work, ladies. We gotta talk. Can we talk after my cereal? Hey.. We gotta talk now. About? I just saw the sisters turn into cougars. Is that a euphemism ...? No, I really saw them turned into cougars. Big cats. They put Coopersmith into some kind of a trance and there was this ritual and they just ...kkkk!.. Cougars Dude, please sell me whatever you're smoking..!! I'm being serious! I realized where I saw Clara's amulet. It's the same design as this South American totem on display at the Natural History Museum. Kala-bast. The "who in the "what now ...? Kala-bast. There was a whole tribe of Amazons that worshipped her centuries ago. Ka they believed that Kala-bast kept them fed, kept them healthy and gave them eternal life. All they had to do in return for that was mate with mortal men from the other tribes and -- here comes the important part! -- eat human flesh. What do you think happened to that Anson guy who showed up here? You think he just left in a cab? No! They ate him!!!!! Oh, my God. I mean you have lost it my friend.. They said they grew up in South America, right? So maybe they found that amulet and they're using it to, I don't know, make themselves young again? Or make themselves wealthy.. Alright, look, man, I'm feeling a little under the weather... I just wanna eat my breakfast, do my work for the day and crash. This is probably more than I can deal with ... Something's up with you. Are you having weird dreams? Wake up tired? Ya, Me too. In fact, that's what woke me up this morning. It's them. They're doing this to all of us ...! Look you need to go home, Darwin. Seriously. You can't handle this. I'm not going any where not after what i just saw. I'm gonna go eat my cereal outside. Have fun being a crazy person.. Your little friend Darwin doesn't want to play anymore. Witch makes us have no use for him, Except for a morcel. Any ideas? Lance. Lance? The most popular guy on campus.. He would be perfect for you. Hmmm. You can get him here? Today? Yes. "Yes what? Yes, mistress ... Good you will be richly rewarded. How did you nerds swing a place like this? Man, you'd better not be lying about this party! Would I lie to you? Maybe .. if you thought your life was in jeopardy. My life isn't in jeopardy ... Not yet. Wow ..What big, strong, rippling muscles you have ... Coopersmith didn't tell me somebody like you would be here. I'm sure Coopersmith didn't tell you a lot of things. I guess you're going to find those out for yourself now .. You think I'm crazy now? Since when does Coopersmith pal around with Lance? In fact, Lance is the guy who threw Coopersmith's bunk off of the dorm roof a few months ago! Lance is here to replace you. Replace me?!? What the hell are you talking about?!? The sisters need their mates in order to survive. you didn't want to cooperate with them. Now, Lance joins us and you get to be the feast for the solstice. Snap out of it, Rufus... Rufus Snap out of it,.. Coopersmith ...!!! Coopersmith ...!!! You got to come with me... Coopersmith.. I don't know what they told you, but they're gonna end up killing all of us. They have chosen to be their mates. . All hale Kala-bast! You're too late, Darwin. Unlike you, they've fallen completely under our under our spell. And unlike them, you're about to be eaten ... I thought you pretty boys loved cougars? I think Im going to eat you with my human teeth... There'd better be a good explanation why I'm all covered in oil ...! So ... they really were cougars? RUFUS Like, literally? Yaa... Yoo , Lance, think you could we get a ride back into town? Get bent, nerd! Looks like where walking .... Never mind that, what about the rest of the summer? No way am I flipping burgers after this! Oh, I don't know ... I think we will get a few dollars from a museum... Are you serious? Hasn't that thing caused enough trouble already? Think of it like hazard pay.
