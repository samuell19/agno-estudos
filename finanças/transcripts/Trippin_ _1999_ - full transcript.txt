Now, the Harlem Renaissance writers... put their philosophy into their works. What I want you to do is to put your work into action. Miss Hawkins, I'm a prospective employer, so I'm trying to see if I should give you a job or to dump you like so much unemployable trash. So I want you to describe yourself to me. Well, I would say that I'm a hard worker, and my G.P.A. is... Miss Hawkins, I'm a crazy employer. I majored in philosophy. I'm a nut. I want you to give me the essence of yourself, the reason beyond the obvious as to why I should hire you. Well, then I'd say... that I am the light that illuminates the answers... to everything you need to know. Go, girl! That's my cousin. She's so deep. Damn, that's all right. Miss Hawkins, you are hired. You get the job, you get the bonus... and the company car, which is not quite as nice as mine. Mr. Reed? Mr. Reed! - Hmm? What? Yeah. - Me too. Oh, Harlem is in New York. Yeah, it's in New York. Yeah. Got a cousin that lives there. Mm-hmm. Mr. Reed, you don't get the job, you don't get the bonus, and I kick your butt out the door. Here's the bottom line, students.

Did you know that a rapper has to learn traditional forms of rhyme and syntax? Basically everything you were supposed to learn in English. I'll just be a manager then. They got a lover's booth over there? 'Cause that's where I'm gonna be. Yeah, yeah, June, you could make a lot of money doing that. Male prostitute... See, but you're going the wrong way. Selling sex for money is prostitution. Just like his mama. Yo. For real, man, that's not funny. What did I tell you about that, man? What about you, Greg? Oh, I don't know. Well, then there are some options I think you might want to check out at Career Day. I'll be a teacher if I could drive a car like yours. You want to drive a car like mine?Yes, indeed. I worked hard for that car, Greg. Before I was a teacher, I was a businessman. I owned my own company for 20 years. In fact, I was just like you dogs when I was in high school. And then I met someone who told me about choices. I had no idea. He said, "You can go left, or you can do what's right." Now, I'm... I'm headed for the future, guys. Who's brave enough to join me? Man, I'm skippin' next period. I'm down. Not me, man. I'm meeting Cinny. Damn, man. You always with that old chicken-head-ass girl. You can't get enough of her. That's right. Can't get enough.

What's the matter with you, man?What the hell's your problem? Nothin', man. It's just she's real sensitive about that kind of stuff. I don't want it getting back to her. I'm sensitive about my shirt. You shouldn't have told Shawn. You got a big mouth. Shawn ain't got nothin' to do with my shirt.All right. All right. Come on. It's a brand-new shirt, man.All right, y'all.
