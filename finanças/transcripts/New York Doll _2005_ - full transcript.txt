it took me over an hour to get I get them the Santa Monica bus from over here on Santa Monica and wheelchair took me over an hour to get into Hollywood she waited we should get to for the next one that's coming this doesn't stop at the young I'm still just at this point I'm I'm not married I was about to go out on dates for that type of stuff but because I work in I work in the temple I have to go very easy on these relationships and it's not you know instant section wham bam thank you ma'am stuff you know I just it's not you know what it once was if we don't even live in a world everyone that world doesn't exist anymore and some I'm spoiled from the past and it's hard to talk to put those those memories kind of get it it's hard to put them away they might find this memories [Music] [Music] people that get into bands and people that are musicians whether they are conscious of it or not they're usually looking for something up there and they're usually looking for the truth doctor told me I want to select just ban a really wild rockin old man and I wanna call it the dolls she that's a great name like bent down don't dolls this is a group he was in love the song is playing stage he moved a bit robotic he kind of like a giant Frankenstein he doesn't look like he would be that active author couldn't breathe and play bass at the same time they would take like a deep breath and then like by how to put your notes and then stop and take a deep breath and then they had a bunch of notes and that was the uniqueness you don't kind of mix a tutu with engineer boots but all the way taking engineer who's gonna paint them yellow or something and so on the one and he seemed kind of a bit effeminate but on the other hand he was a very big solid macho guy down [Music] well also was struggling with alcohol Johnny and Jerry was struggling with heroin are there was too drunk to play and because Johnny and Jerry were too stoned to play the drugs became more important to them than the band driving around in limousines and playing in the Olympia theater and living some type of you know truly magnificent to living the life that most people don't get a chance to live on earth to having that and then losing that losing that because of our bad behavior and our use of drugs and all that stuff we we have lost we lost in New York towns just a few years into into the golfing yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] demoted from a guitar to show up on the bus [Music] how did you get the name killer Kane okay first the article written about the New York Dolls mentioned killer basslines sure as a descriptive adjective talking about my base blame killer base lines but one of the adversaries of Buck Rogers was someone they called the leader Kane or killer Kane killer I became Joel Jamie thank you were ya killer Kane that's Arthur you wouldn't know it because he's very quiet he's very quiet and but he's he's that's that's true he still he still got the playing in him you never forget that I guess because my name is author the guitars nickname is Excalibur and we want to get the collective legend straight Excalibur is not to get to it's not the name of the sword that authored you from the stone Excalibur is the name of the sword given to Arthur by the Lady of the lake I am the anchorman are you don't use them okay even and then even if they um I don't actually count off the song I'm responsible for keeping the tempo I have to serve maintaining that everything's flowing smoothly and that all the beginnings and ends of the songs I can float to you I started working with him every day and he works like three days a week he keeps two copiers with loaded with paper all the different stations that we have here in the library and he does all of that he's a terrific game no no it's a frigates about two years and I remember he said he had a band and I had no idea there was popular as they were in New York and he was in a such an important part of their group can't believe I know a rock star he had extreme humility he really did yet hearing hearing is connected to one of the most raucous notorious rock-and-roll bands and news [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because it was such fantastic pop music it just seemed to me like the absolute answer to everything the mc5 and the Stooges are good but it was the dolls that are really excited came out of a New York City that was broken on the rocks and therefore and wide openings for rock and roll to emerge like like weeds and cracked cement the New York Dolls impact on London was there was a bomb going on they assimilated all this music into their sound and you know at the time it was it was too much for most people to be able to handle [Music] [Music] you must remember that from the point of view of anyone who loved music music was dead people forget how absolutely dank things were how dank life was and pop art was jus either it's stupid my opinion heavy metal [Music] these nonsensical a prog-rock rubbish there was no sense of danger with in pop music at all well they're all wearing Afghans hope they all play 25 minutes drum solos and it was boring [Music] well what can I say growing up in the New York City area and being a teenager when the dolls were at their peak they were God's to me the New York Dolls were like they were kind of like a pinhole of light in the early 70s you know their image was somewhat disturbing to a lot of people so here were boys who were calling themselves dolls and they looked like prostitutes male prostitutes and it was extraordinary I loved the Osmonds and and David Cassidy and everything I thought they were cute and they were sweet and they were easy to photograph then they were easy to work with but suddenly I'm looking at this bunch and I thought oh okay fasten your seat belts we're in for a good time now you best be at the dam down 14 eg you hear [Music] [Music] the list is astonishing at The Pretenders The Sex Pistols The Clash the damned Generation X the list is absolutely and we took a lot from the New York Dolls we took a lot you know they were like really really raw rock-and-roll really high-energy great songs and they look like they came from Mars or somewhere it was it was like a telegram from out of space just like this fantastic comet suddenly lands and it's multicolored and it's gorgeous and and it makes the most fabulous sound most important thing was style to them and that made such a massive impression the world wasn't ready it seems to take the it seems to take the pop world thirty years to understand anybody to really understand a group or an artist and often it takes deaths within the group and then people say ah yes we do like those people know that we're not here and there's no reason on earth why it shouldn't have happened but for some strange reason this group has always been cursed [Music] johnny and jerry formed the heartbreakers david and SIL for a while continued on being the New York Dolls Arthur I think then at that time pretty much went off on his own he was in several other bands even for one cell he will get Los Angeles he formed a band called killer came with a form of guitar player - that didn't work out and form another band with Jerry Nolan of the dolls called idols and they were around for about a year or two and then he returned to New York and he formed another band called the quartz grinders and then he moved back to Los Angeles and with his wife Barbara well I had unique experience being a rock stars wife that had no money I was not the pampered pet that some of these women are living in beautiful mansions driving nice cars etc etc he was dining out for a long time he was very very sad I'm very very embittered about his the way his life had turned out he had never earned money from the Dolls yet anybody who remotely imitated the dolls were having millions of dollars thrown at them I think that was very difficult for him to live with especially when you know seeing how successful Johnny had become and Jerry and then David with his alter ego what's the point Dexter it was hard enough it is very hard enough there was so much pain in his eyes and I don't think he really enjoyed his life [Music] because Arthur was a rock artist he didn't have much many skills we both were doing actually some extra film work a lot of sci-fi and action adventure I was in critters we were in space balls in her space I had no money we had no friends I would just I couldn't get off the booze I was smoking also he had seen one of the dolls I won't say who on TV [Music] flipped him out so much and hurt him so much that he went out and drank a quart of peppermint schnapps he ripped all my clothes off he started to beat me with a cat furniture I left him and that's when he jumped out the kitchen window I went out the window thinking that I could do it I didn't he jumped out of the third storey the planter box broke his fall I landed on my head I shattered my kneecap and they also shattered my left elbow and to this day I have a couple of metals who was hanging out of here it took me a year to teach myself how to walk again in in a a this is called being at rock-bottom they were sitting in bed and I had a pie I had a Bible but they also had a TV Guide nevers watching for a mother one web TV and it was happened to those in the TV Guide was an ad for a church and the church is calling Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints they say sits in for the Book of Mormon it's free I thought well I'll make a phone call and they'll mail me a book and then maybe I'll read the bulk of maybe I won't you know we'll see what they got said you know maybe it's job as witnesses or whatever it might be I don't know what design so he called the Book of Mormon people well they don't send it they bring it I'm too beautiful our young blonde missionaries came to my door Mormon missionaries came to my doing this sister sister missionaries Jenny said hello we're here to teach you your seven basic gospel principle classes I think was one late afternoon I decided to give it a whirl and sincerely prayed to find out sure until truth I received an answer pretty much right away and the only thing I could liken it to from my experiences from my experiences was that there's a bit like a trip and LSD trip from the Lord I think it happens a little differently to everyone a lot of people describe it as a burning that they feel a burning sensation in their chest they sense it in a way that is very difficult to describe it was like a drug experience but I do one no drugs and vomits what he told me said you never gonna believe this but I've converted to Mormonism joining the Mormon Church changed things for him the Mormon thing I think gave him some kind of a purpose because he did have something to do he had to go to these he went to his job there you know and he would go to the services and so and he was really you know into doing it oh you know where's Arthur tonight and he's like oh you know he couldn't make it out tonight he's got Church in the morning and I'm like Church wait you know what are you talking about cuz you know not a lot of people go to church very paradoxical when you think of this guy in lipstick and fish and it tights and you know creating a chaos around the world becoming a Mormon you know just kind of if you like Donny Osmond becoming a New York doll nothing to believe in but nothing what a heroine lot of drugs nothing I'm always happy when someone finds something they can believe it [Music] [Music] [Music] it became a bit lonely for me for the first couple years in the church rust tippet was assigned as Arthur's home teacher in theory at least every member of the church is assigned a home teacher expected to make at least one visit a month to the home sometimes more depending on how things are and depending on their level of friendship I mean he on many times when we were driving to and from church expressed to me frustrations with the church okay turning point a big turning point even in the more mature for me wasn't just even recently although I joined him 1989 was Mac McGregor saying hey got a job for you and the Family History Center he says it's a calling if you'd like I think it was a little bit of a shock to him than he he had his way of showing his surprise well Arthur Kane might be a good candidate for working in the family history library it might be something I'm interested and that he would like to do intelligent and that was perfect until truth work working for Jesus Christ and working for the Church of Jesus Christ we know the difference [Music] he works with with people here that come in and are looking for their great-great-great grandmother a great-great grandfather and that's really a difficult difficult thing two weeks after I started working in the family history library I was going through the Social Security death records I found out that my dad had passed away my own dad I said I have no brothers and sisters that my mom and dad my mom passed away when I was 17 about a year so later my dad got married to someone of course I didn't want to ever he talked to him and that was younger my family life he discovered that his dad had died and he never found out about it in the other way except he read it there and that was I was just shocked him to realize that here his own father he had to learn about by reading it in the family history center Arthur was always short on finances his route was paid by Social Security disability you know he would run low even on grocery money he tasted success at a young age and had his expectations raised very high and of course he never met those expectations or came anywhere close to meeting those expectations me and then we'd go out to see bands a lot you know we should be up there plan which was fish stuff man well you know because why are we standing here looking at these guys they don't yeah so he'd get pissed off and that was he wasn't even drunk so if he was drunk forget about it that's all he talked about was the dolls and getting back together that's totally out of his mind is getting the dolls back together I was thought is his life he was always wanting it to happen but there was no real solid way of going about it there was a scripture read to Arthur and a home teaching lesson and it's in Mormon 921 in the Book of Mormon behold I say unto you that whosoever in cry doubting nothing whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it shall be granted him and this promise is unto all even unto the ends of the earth well the meltdown festival is an annual festival in England and it's one person is appointed if you like the caretaker of the event and this year it was me and I got an email from a friend I hadn't heard of in 30 years he says Oh Arthur I understand you're in town to play you'll be in town playing Marcy's meltdown and at the Royal Festival this summer I didn't know who to call I got a I got several emails and I got some emails from some girls in France who each have Johnny Thunders and they know their own yield on websites but I figured listen I wouldn't find out about this let me call the guy who's mainly responsible marzia so I had a number for him that I had to call in five years just his favorite number because I know he has a place to stay here in LA so I called her number and I was shocked to get him on the phone he was shocked that I was calling him also he said please tell me what's going on he was so full of doubts could it possibly be David really wants to do it play those songs were going to be together we're going to rehearse I'm gonna go to New York and rehearse with him I said Arthur people loved the dolls and they wanted to happen and it's going to be absolutely wonderful probably right across the street from the houses of parliament you know and the River Thames and Big Ben nose would be around the corner and hoping his head was so full of Dreams he just started talking about you know stories from 30 years ago with the dolls his hopes of you know what his future career would be like how much he was looking forward to getting back together with David Johansen and so Sylvain and you know he was just he was just so happy it was it was a beautiful sight to behold it's something that's meant to be and and say all of the cards are being you know laid out on the table just you know for for this for this event to take place this is stomach musical event to take place how can I go from Family History Center to the Royal Albert just came from well we just came from the pawn shop well I had got no loan on this guitar I was in jeopardy of losing some of my guitars and into the pawn shop because I didn't have the money to even to pay the interest on the lawn for several years he had been paying the pawnshop $175 a year so that they could keep his guitars when all he had to do was pay them two hundred and sixty two dollars to get the guitars out of the pawn shop well he just looked at me quizzically as if it never really occurred to him that he could do that in retrospect perhaps the reason it never occurred to him was because he never had two hundred and sixty-two dollars at any one time that would have enabled him to do that everybody [Music] sure that's right son snow at Marcy's meltdown London to play the Sun it was very nervous he was excited but he was nervous too he was really nervous playing the gig I mean he's gonna play Festival he hasn't played and you know with these guys in 30-something years and he's gonna go to London and play a festival in front of a hundred thousand people pretty scary for a guy like him okay doesn't sound like much at the moment you know but I think I asked him Arthur are you nervous about getting together for the first time after 30 years and his response was I'm not nervous about anything the only thing I'm nervous about is this guy they're getting to replace Johnny Thunders you know I'm nervous that he's not gonna be able to keep up with the rest of us in the beginning no one was sure how Arthur was gonna be because he hadn't I mean still veins been playing David's been playing I guess Arthur had been out of music for a while off there's always they're always asking can also play can offer play I'm not worried about like I'm not worried [Music] because I play bass guitar which is a large guitar I'm not running around on stage doing power slides and you know setting the guitar on fire and playing it with my teeth upside down this stuff you know it's just not something bass players do lose bass players she just give to giving the groove and stay there and keep it together I mean you guys may become Arthur King groupies I'm a little bit old but then I can still be a groupie I guess I am worried about the fans partying are gonna view the dolls as being the same party guys we wore when we were 19 years old where you come out in the hallway of the hotel and through people sleeping there in the hallway after the show but not just one or two there were 30 or 40 and so when you go in tour and do that type of stuff are you worried aren't you all over the place that could happen again well I told you that should happen again just as something you get again used to it if you're not used to it first up to 30 years I've been too ignored and been living in obscurity and been told and I'm just as a loser and now what we want to get back to the 10th excitement well I have to get used to it because there's something I haven't dealt with in 40 years okay everybody ready this is the campy song is everybody ready okay rolling okay Lonely Planet boy one two three four [Music] well [Music] [Music] we came that first day to rehearsal even that first day I was still like I wasn't quite sure what was gonna happen cuz you know they even didn't show up it was sort of like you know it was frustrating in a way because you know we were you know we knew what we stood me and author and almost sudden we have like new guys that we really never knew or even met before you know and they're telling us you know like sort of our music better than they know how music better not something let's go the dolls had played together and with almost 30 years so you know nobody knew if it was gonna gel if it was gonna be a disaster this is a very well known jazz studio it's probably the best rehearsal studio in New York City and today we have been privileged to be graced by the New York Dolls this is probably the coolest band that's ever come here [Music] first time I got to meet these guys in the dolls I've heard about him but no it's pretty exciting to be working with so many original guys some things are in different keys which I guess is maybe not so easy to do after you've played a song or written a song in a certain key like author has Arthur had been out of music for a while maybe played a gig once every couple of years maybe the first few minutes or something he might have been a little bit flustered and said hey what am I doing here but you know after a couple times through I'm still [Music] so David Johansen wasn't there today no feel about that I took the first rule for being there today in that sense over the years he he came to look at David Johansen is something of an adversary rather than a friend and I think that seeing him on on TV and as the alter-ego of Buster Poindexter I think it bothered him and felt that that he was taking a part of a life that that he that Arthur should have been sharing it by the time they got to New York for the rehearsals that Arthur was expecting a very chilly reception from David because he had this thing in his head about David you know and him David had this thing going I don't know why and David didn't want to talk to him because he heard all the stuff that Arthur was saying about him and Arthur was saying all these bad things saying all these guys are making money they're in cahoots I talked to the bishop the other day about these anxieties especially about David Johansen you know maybe playing tricks on people or making it you know mm difficult but till choose it after I explained to David you're handsome was and about you know all of this stuff and the bishop just told me he said author I said be a good latter-day Saint do your job and everything will be fine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I didn't know what they were thinking but I didn't even I just felt like I'm gonna go in and enjoy these guys company because you know I I loved that himself well I saw Arthur he seemed genuinely happy that he and David were as he put it friends again I didn't see any tension you know maybe individually they were a little nervous or something they certainly didn't show it and it just seemed like old pals just getting together again yeah we kind of picked up where we left off right which is the way it should be well my impression was you left off in a trailer court in Florida screaming at each other yeah you came back in a much better spot [Music] [Music] Oh how are they gonna do in London well we can see I don't really know I think the band sounds great in a lot of cases I think it sounds I mean better than the records I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing you know the newspapers over there if they can't say something nasty about you they can't say anything at all I don't know I don't even think about go out there give the best you got and that's what that's all you are you know and why try to be something you're not you know so we'll see how the show's gonna go but I I'm going in there I like it's gonna be great but these guys sound great he is absolutely convinced that he is going to go out there and perform perfectly he is going to do everything just exactly right if there is a weak link it is not going to be him [Music] [Music] if I [Music] slays me okay forget it I get a phone here we got a phone here I get into you know connections for to a couple computers or something like that but there's another phone in the bathroom and I'm just saying they have more stuff in this room than I have been my apartment as far as living comfortably yeah I don't have a boy three phones and the computer plug-in system you know no no do I have a beautiful you know mahogany desk or anything so stuff you know and it's nice stuff so till truth I'd be just as happy to him stay here look at the Thames for the rest of my life you know the millennium wheel and watching people go by and then that's a furniture in here don't I please call in a bunch of junk my place look like rinky-dink we'd like this mahogany and and then the big chairs and the official looking desk and over Stefan [Music] it was very lucky in the first time that I ever discovered the dolls they appeared very famously on the Old Grey Whistle death which in those very dark days of 73 it was a fantastic vision it's because the Old Grey Whistle test was predominantly a really boring really serious rock show that I hardly ever watched and then all the sudden the New York Dolls were honor and their appearance on the Old Grey Whistle test had a huge effect on the up-and-coming punk generation which was my age group I kind of grew my hair like Johnny Thunders as much as possible I used to go around and very high-heeled shoes was 13 and it was the right time and for everybody there's an artist that catches you just at the right time an artist or a group and you never let them go and they can never disappoint you and the dolls were that for me after the Ziggy Stardust probably the most influential group on my life he was this wild totally tumultuous band just making this glorious racket and and they didn't care about 25 minute drum solos and they upset the presenter of the show who said who called it Mont Rock the New York dollars or in old far a whispering Bob Harris they caught him it's kind of taken up in his like he called it mock rock but when he said that what he didn't realize is the thousands of kind of alienated kids were like yeah this is our band you know you're trying to put him down but in fact he went like this with him well when they came to London that first time with Billy Murcia they really were a hearse breath away from stardom of achieving everything they'd wanted of getting a great record deal there's a good record deal on the table for them it was being set up the night that Billy died and everybody was expecting the doll to walk on the stage and of course they didn't there was just suddenly an announcement that Billy had died and everybody know just collapsed there were two english groupies and they said oh yes we remember we took billy back to our apartment and he was very stoned on Mandrax and alcohol and he passed out so we put him in a bathtub of cold water and we poured hot coffee down his throat basically what these two dumb groupies did was suffocate Billy is it it changes from being this this really cute little glam fairy story to becoming much more hardcore as they go along and I'm building up this rep this dangerous reputation since then the replacement drama Gerry Nolan has died Johnny Thunders obviously has died this this is this is a blighted band it really is it's not strange after all these years of writing and talking about it it's had it not been for heroin Johnny and Jerry would have been at the show [Music] to go to this banquet like such a punishing banquet I mean in my opinion Arthur was just having the time of his life I looked over at one point and said isn't this delicious this is the most delicious luncheon I've ever had he was just he was having a blast he loved it with very very cool [Music] it gives me great pleasure who after he gets this award is going to go straight to the hospital and stand calmly Tunes to cheer up the kids [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd like to say to the dolls the only reason why I'm really [Applause] let's take a look at this photo [Music] [Music] Johnny Thunders mostly sometimes Jerry Noland will be with him sometimes Sylvain Sylvain it's the first time the actual instance underscore again they became a legend because they burned themselves because you know this rockin world way of life to explain fast this make the legend my mind is positive for the show because it's it's like you're going to meet our friend you know from a long time so what's happening I mean if the if your friend is a it is more or more fart or this is not a problem we we are for the music there is the story around the music but basically it's the music if the play good it's okay for me you know we mentioned I thought instead I thought you could miss him Maxim in LA or something after the riots do you guess better be nice to watch this time when I come back for another 30 years are you worried at all about tonight no how come we saw no homework we've done our homework we put into time we learned the songs we're and now and there's a tremendous spirit that at the bottom of the New York Dolls and it's got to do with me still and even and there are three living new adults in here three dead New York dancing and some the people who are dead they are with us all song in spirit somehow this is not this is like me being in the Family History Center we're playing for our fans they want us to sound good they they were encouraging us to sound good and they were there I hope their hopes and dreams are with us you know and so to me that's at the board is to be that's 90 but that's not an audience you know it's just about your friends I may be a dreamer but the dream become true you know so these guys I'm gonna do ask the people at the marriage that six ounces where'd you get this long jacket thing pretty well I know a bellhop or whatever but then someone hears that there's someone that staff is working as a you know kind of a formal long jacket with little gold epaulettes it's not the society called the Golden Key there's any rocks never ever ask for your coat before no first time first time it is requested the concierge gave up his jacket for you well I guess we don't have any buttons on your back like that this isn't it you wear what you wanna wear yeah what you look cool do you want somebody to go get your leather pants Arthur Neha Sonia just today that he's bought some boots and he wants to find a long coat that goes down to his knees he wants to convey a Joseph Smith kind of image you said I have kind of a white roughly shirt and black leather pants Joseph Smith Brigham Young you know pick your prophet that's who Arthur wants to be when he's on stage I may be in time but rock and roll is not a time yeah gopher really I didn't find you for the bones hey guys run station 20 minute and you know the power of the whole pirate thing about swashbuckling is very vocal Johnny Depp Johnny Depp now through the Bible [Applause] [Music] food is doing your vouchers that everybody walking on oh we're getting cool but you don't get your cut you're just gonna give it to the church it's hurt your copy I mean you are lovely John Smith and is wonderful bringing me honor people they will tie the Arthur Lipscomb you say 10% of my earnings on my game I'm gonna take the Mormon tobacco assessment blessing program okay yeah then in smoke when Moses went up on that hill it's very sensible yeah cuz you know caffeine turns into a spirit yeah nicotine is the most different drug there is you have to be the temperament you have to what no I don't drink [Music] [Applause] David I'm saying deeper thing yeah I will come to gracious Heavenly Father as we bow our heads before the disdain we wish to thank tea it is with gratitude nos that we wish to thank thee for the many multiple blessings that you bring to into our lives all of our lives and your every father if there was any band that is wishes to thank you for this great blessing it's New York Dolls we ask that the spirits of Johnny Billy and Jerry be with us this evening also and dear every father we ask that we play well W we have fun the audience has fun and that everyone will have a great time and dear Heavenly Father for these things we pray in the name of thy beloved son and has to Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well I was worried that the reality would destroy the myth my kids listen to the dolls cuz you know typically they've gone through dad's collection and I said I've got tickets for the dolls that they got out of school and they said we don't want to go and I said excuse me yet the New York Dolls you know and and they said now cuz it won't be like the poster on the wall and hope you like the retin as I left tonight they refused to come they were playing the record and looking at the poster but they were afraid kind of like me that I was just reliving my you because you fear that you fear the absolute worst in these events and you you you're convinced that it can only be disappointing and the past is the past and it's a long time ago and whoever made that great music is now gonna look silly [Music] but that wasn't the case the guys delivered a hundred percent they did it absolutely right and everybody was just a gas [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I don't think he ever really believed that he would ever be standing on a stage playing those songs again with David and Sylvain and I just watching him throughout the night I could just see a sense of bewilderment sadness and joy everything was in his face and I think he was just praying throughout the night praying with thanks to somebody whom he now believed him [Music] and the dolls broke up I kind of like took a look at myself you know and said you know you'd sit at home and I started changing you know Arthur is such a beautiful brilliant draw but like sensitive cat you know it's inner core is strong that he can you know stand for him stand up for himself David I noticed that Arthur didn't move around a lot on stage the vibes of bass actually makes you after that I gotta stand still here because I'm getting such severe vibrations coming through and it's like all down there you know it's in the loin I don't think it's really about their personality I think it's about how is God playing through it so if he loves God he'd be a great bass player David Johansen still a fantastic showman Sylvain is the heart and soul and also truly remains the only living statue in rock and roll [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a rock'n'roll band nice to make people happy it's part of it it's really that's what my own job is to make people dance but to get excited like Showtime we make excitement you know I can remember telling I'm hey gosh congratulations you played again after 30 years and what a great success story and he quickly corrected me and said no this success is that I was able to go back with my good friends and and go back and mend fences with with David that's that's what was so important about getting back together again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and I went to him late when I said absolutely fantastic playing and his eyes were welling he looks just at home you know that's the truth he looks like you know totally easy on the stage I could do without the leather pants a bit of a mistake you know and the diamante tie look you know but that's Prelude the Mormon influence he shouldn't go back to that library he was he was telling me that he was a bit sad that your Monday morning he'd put on a suit and he'd put on the tie and shirt and get on the bus and you know I think he should put on his diamante tie and getting the band bus [Music] a modern-day limousine my concern was that he would come back from London he just come back to his apartment here in Los Angeles and his life would be the same as it was before and it

York Dolls died in Los Angeles Tuesday night according to Billboard com the group's manager says Kane had leukemia he was 55 Kane is the fourth New York doll to pass away including guitarist Johnny Thunder who died of a drug overdose in 1991 the tragedy because we lost a really sweet man and a good friend and I'm very good friend and but it was a blessing that he passed so rapidly without having to suffer without losing all of his hair and going through all of the treatments and that tremendous amount of medical bills and things yeah it was a blessing as well if a life must end as Arthur's
