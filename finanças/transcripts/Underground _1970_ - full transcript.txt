[LAUGHS] Good morning, sir. Didn't recognize you. Been a while. Has Condon taken off yet? No, sir. Didn't know you knew about it. - Open up. - Yes, sir. [PHONE RINGING] Herman Bishop. Sir? I'm sorry, sir. But I have to ask you to get out. You're under arrest. Okay, Soldier. Sergeant. - Everything secure? - Uh, yes, sir. - Well, then let's get going. - Sir! On the double. Move it. Come on. Joe? What the hell are you doing here? Well, I thought I'd come along to hold your hand. After all I do know the route. G2 didn't say anything about you coming. All right, since when do I need permission from G2 to come and have a farewell blast with one of my buddies. - You're late. - We came through the valley. I wanted to check there before we made the pickup. - Well? - Perfect. All clear. It's almost time to meet the plane. Make the pickup and meet us back at the bakery. All right. We go. We had best check the woods. Your ID information. I am Antoine Dupreaux. The nephew of Madame Marie Dupreaux. I've been called by her to assist with the bakery. Where from, Frenchman? As my papers say Bassonet. What's your schedule? Jump zero minus fifteen. Contact Maquis group Sophia who'll escort me as far as the river at Saint-Lo. Proceed along north three miles to the stone yard where Maquis group Annabelle will take me to the safe house. It is imperative that I travel alone and avoid at all costs any contact with an unknown Frenchman named Jule Moravin. Moravin! [SCOFFING] How the hell do I avoid contact with somebody I don't know? Does it bother you, Joe? Do you think it should? MAN: Five minutes to jump. Five minutes to jump. Five minutes... Approaching destination. Crosswind approximately 12 knots. We'll swing out over the trees and let the wind take you in. Joe! What the... Get on the bench, Dave, you got a long ride back. They're right. You are crazy. Quick. Run across the field and warn the plane off. It's an ambush. Warn them off. [PLANE DRONING] MAN: Hold position. Hold position. Red light. Red light. Don't jump. Don't jump. We're getting a wave-off. Getting a wave-off. That's it, Joe. Nice try. Joe! He jumped. Quick. We'll make the pickup. You go back and get help. MAN: What's wrong? Did you not see our wave off? I saw it. This is as far as we can take you. My next contact is near St. Chaubain. Take me there. St. Chaubain is outside our group. I'll take you. No, you cannot. Look, don't worry. It will be all right. - What do they call you? - Moravin. Jule Moravin. All right. This is the village you asked for. Now where? Rue Saint Georges. All right. MAN: Hello! Who are you? I'm Antoine Dupreaux. Moravin? Boule! [BOTH LAUGHING] I have not seen you since they closed the market at Forrelle. All right. Let's move. I have to use your radio. - Boule, let's go. - No, Jule, not you. You should not have come even this far. He comes with us. BOULE: No. Why are you here? What is it you want us to do? Oh, I'll tell you when I want you to know. Let me tell you something, my friend. You make a bad impression. This is not a game with us. Every man must die someday. Today. Tomorrow. We prefer tomorrow. Yes. Tomorrow is always a popular choice. Go on. Into the barn. We'll be right behind you. - Boule? - BOULE: Wait. [LAUGHS] - MORAVIN: Hey, Pommard! - Ah, Jule! Oh, it's so nice to see you. Been so long, huh? Oh, MonsieurJacquard! [JACQUARD SPEAKING FRENCH] Hello, MonsieurDupreaux! My name is Boule, you know, hmm? That is Jacquard, Fosse. Yvonne. Yvonne will be your wife. I am glad to meet my husband. Get the radio. He wants to send a message. - Very well. - Wait. First, what is your mission? I'll discuss my mission later after I ask some questions. After you ask questions? It seems that this new Antoine does not trust us. The jump I made tonight was top secret. And that field was crawling with Germans. Why? A very dark night, my new friend. And the German expect parachute on such a night. They are swine the German, but they are not stupid. We warned him off but, uh, he jumped anyway. The patrol that hit us was centered on our drop. Why? They guessed and with luck. - Anything else? - Yes. I think they were waiting for us. I think it was luck and nothing more. Or no more than an informer. I have killed men for much less. You sure? Boule is right. The Germans were lucky. Nothing more. The Germans had information. Information from a man who would violate his own security. [GRUNTING] He was the informer. I knew this man. You knew him, did you? Did you know that he was responsible for the death of three agents? And probably ten times as many Maquis? Know, man, your friend! You didn't know him at all. - I'll use your radio now. - Oh, no. - Where do you hide it? - No. You'll talk to me now. You tell me why you are here. Well, what the hell have you got to say for yourself? - And I don't want any bloody excuses. - No, sir. It was your mission, Condon. Your mission. If you weren't man enough to do it yourself - we could have gotten somebody who was. - Yes, sir. And of all people, for god's sake, why Dawson? Why did he do it? I think you know why, sir. Yes. So now he's going to ruin whatever chance it may have had. 200,000 men. 15 divisions. He could damn well have their guts hung on the German wire because of him. Why didn't you kill him? - Yes? - Pardon me, sir. But this is from Merrimack. Dawson, sir? Yes, he's got through. He's joined the group. I wish to God he'd been shot. American? This goes now long enough. You kill a Frenchman. You tell us nothing. But now you will. All right. On the whole Western front one man is responsible for the entire German defense command. General Willi Stryker. The same. We're gonna get him. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Or do you think we handful of Frenchmen can get to a headquarters of II Panzer division and a Wehrmacht corp to kill a General? I didn't say kill him. In four days a plane will be arriving from England. General Stryker and I will return to England on that plane. What do they want with him in England? He has information that will shorten the war. He's not noted for his generosity. Boule, six months ago General Stryker had two divisions annihilated on the Russian front. He himself was severely wounded. It, uh, changed his thinking. And you can be sure the Gestapo does not already know about this change of heart? Oh the Gestapo does know. I told them. In exactly four days Stryker shall be relieved of his command. He will travel to Berlin by train, He will board his train here. And the Gestapo will board right with him. Kill him, yes, perhaps. But take him, how? How? Excusez-moi, Monsieur le Gestapo, the General prefer to travel with us. It's madness. Afraid? Yes. Oh, yes. Of what I do not understand. You... You could be the death of all of us. Perhaps. But Stryker would be worth it. Hessler! Hessler... Yes, General? I had some letters here from home. I cannot find them. I haven't seen them, sir. Would you like me to look? Has anybody been in here since yesterday? Not as far as I know, sir. Tell me, have you been able to find out anything from Berlin? What's the agenda for this sudden briefing? - I spoke to General Mearsheimer. - Hmm? But he didn't know. He didn't know? And what about General Rolf? Or perhaps he didn't know either. I haven't been able to get in touch with him. But I did leave word for him to call you. Perhaps he hasn't received the message yet. Or perhaps he has. Sir... Major, you've been with me for two years. I respect you. Trust you. What the hell does this recall to Berlin mean? General, I don't understand. Never mind, Major. We will find out soon enough, huh? MAN: Well? HESSLER: He want his letters. If you have finished photographing them. What was his manner just now? Manner? That of a German officer who has spent 35 years in the service of his country. He won't advise being caught in Berlin. That's ordinary enough. Why not ask him the questions? Because I'm asking you, Major? Major! I'll expect you to report again this evening. I'm a soldier. Not a jail warden. That's all we ask of you, Major Hessler. To be a good soldier of the Third Reich. # What do you think of my new husband? I? Hmm? I think he's a lucky man. He's handsome. He's cold. He's an agent. Even agents are human. This man has no feeling. He is dead. And being dead he has no fear of it. And this is what can kill us all. [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Boule. What is he doing here? He's mad. MAN: Look at her. Round and ripe as the apples. But better tasting, yeah? Come my beautiful collaborator. - Show how your charms rub off on me. - Ah-ah! Why can't you leave the woman alone? - What? - We're here to occupy them not to walk over their necks. [LAUGHING] Where are you from? Chaumont. Well, this is Chaubain. Our town. Our Frenchmen. Our women. DAWSON: My apologies, sir. - You pig! - No, no, no, no. I stumble. I'm sorry about your uniform but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it. If you wish... If you would like I could brush it for you. You filth! I wouldn't let any of you touch my uniform. Who are you? I'm Antoine Dupreaux. Your papers? That's why he came here. To test his papers. Antoine Dupreaux. What is your business? I am a baker. A baker? How heroic! - A man who makes cookies and cakes. - [PEOPLE TITTERING] You'd better leave. Wait outside. OFFICER: It says here you have a leg injury. Prove it to me. Dance. I'm afraid there's only one occasion when I should be able to dance, Sergeant. And when will that be, Frenchman? When you're sleeping with your own women. [LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Some... Sometime, some place I'll get you. Did you see that, Pig? I did. Did you really see? But I polish them just the same. [LAUGHING] Sergeant, I apologize for my countryman. I think maybe the injury is not in his leg but in his head. He does not recognize the humor or the rights of the conqueror. Your conqueror wishes a toast, Frenchman. Of course. To the third Reich! Drink, Frenchman. [GLASS SHATTERING] Your glass. Break it. Break it. [CROWD MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] Do you have a need to drink in places like that? My need is my business. And these Maquis, they are mine. We should be going. Yeah. You take big chances. And you take small ones. That Sergeant in there is from an anti-aircraft unit. Now do they have any bases in this area? There are three. The closest is Sampre. All right, I want all the localities and the areas they cover. We already work on this. We have the information by tomorrow. I'd like it tonight. I'll go with you. No, better you see the American gets home. Go by the bridge. [BELL TOLLING] OFFICER: You! I'm not a bad fellow. You believe that? Yes. I'll buy you a drink. No. No, thank you. I can get a bottle. We can go to your house. Or mine. You know what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean. No, thank you. I have money. My wife is waiting. Your wife? You're not such a fool as you'd have me believe. Who are you? I'm Antoine Dupreaux. So your papers say but your manner does not. I repeat, who are you? [GRUNTING] YVONNE: They will take ten of us to pay for this. Boule will not like what you've done. They'll be after you. They'll know who did it. No! They'll be after the Panzer Sergeant. A room full of people heard him promise revenge. Here they come. Where were you so long? What happened? Nothing. We went around through the orchard. I thought there might be a patrol. Ah! Can't a woman take an evening stroll with her husband? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, of course. YVONNE: If you were worried, I'm sorry. BOULE: No, that's all right. Forget it. You go to bed now. You must be tired, huh? I will be up in a moment. Tell me, Boule, uh, what do you think of him? - I think that France has lost. - Hmm? Lost a trade. We sent America a statue of liberty, they send us a statue of wind. And a cold wind at that. There's something more in that plan than we know. YVONNE: I'm sorry you were worried. BOULE: You should not have gone there. [BELL TOLLING] DAWSON: What's the building with the slate? To the left. The long one. That's a brewery. The bridge will give better cover. How many streets leading in? Boule said the ambush on the wall would be better. Stryker would be out in the open and we'd have the trees for cover. And get Stryker killed before we can even get close, huh? Or get us killed before we get close to him. Yes, but Stryker would be alive. You're very skillful. What did you do before the war? I was a civil engineer. And you? I was a housewife. My husband was killed. I came here. I worked for a year. Boule is a decent man. It's not complicated. He has his attitude and I have mine. And what... What is your attitude? Living one day at a time. Last night you killed a man. I have seen it before but never like that. People kill for many reasons. For us this is our country. But killing for you, what is it? Necessary. For the war or for you? Major, do you like roses? They're just coming into bloom. Very nice, Gerrard. I'm sure the General would like some. Well, I thought so too. I take some to his room, door was locked. I knocked. No answer. When was that? Oof! Two hours ago. Thank you. General! General! General Stryker! General Stryker! General! General Stryker! - What is it, Major? - Oh, I am... I'm sorry, General. But I just wanted to... I knocked and... I was afraid that... Afraid? Oh... That's all right then. I must have dozed off. I didn't sleep too well last night. Well, help yourself to a brandy. Make it a good one. I'll join you when I'm dressed. - [GLASSES CLINKING] - Max. Thank you. [PRIEST PRAYING IN LATIN] The General is leaving tomorrow morning. 10:00. He'll be guarded. And he'll take the cargo road. How many in the escort? Too many, I'm afraid. You have all the information in here. [KNOCKING DOOR] Please, continue. We just want to pay our respects to the Monsieur. - No, I want your respect. - Paul... I must leave now. You should learn manners. Your father was a fine man. A good shoemaker. Minded his own business. Please, go ahead. [CONTINUES PRAYING IN LATIN] Madam. It is time to go now, Paul. I'm not going. WOMAN: Paul. - Please. - PAUL: I'm not going. WOMAN: We should be going. You go ahead. Losing a father is a very hard thing. Not if he's a coward. What makes you think he was? He died in bed. Not killing Germans. So you think that killing Germans proves that you're not a coward? Of course. No. I know a soldier who's killed many Germans. He's received many medals and people call him a hero. But he doesn't like himself too much. You know why? Because he knows that man was made to create, not to destroy. There are many fighters in the world. They don't all carry guns. Who is a coward? Who is really the hero? The man who kills or the man who loves? The man who makes death or the man who makes shoes? Your mother's waiting. The train leaves St. Chaubain on Thursday. I suggest that until then you see as little of General Stryker as possible. No. In his condition it is dangerous to leave him alone. Precisely. That is more than a suggestion, Major. General Stryker's indiscretion is as embarrassing for him as for the government. The General is very respected. Perhaps our most famous commander next to Rommel. An accident would be very convenient for all of us. DAWSON: All right, this is where we'll do it. At the rail yard. EMILE: No, no, no, no. Boule said it would be the road. I say the road. Look, it's 20 kilometers, 30 minutes from Stryker's headquarters. Now the switch engine will have to pick up the car from the spur track. And what do we use for cover at the rail yard? - Nothing. - [ALL SNIGGERING] And what about his escort? No, I believe his escort will take him only up to the rail yard. We get to Stryker between the time they leave and the train pulls out. EMILE: Now look, it would take at least 50 men to do this. - No, five will do. - Five? All right. Look just suppose that we get to Stryker. Then what do we do? We run like hell. Get into the brewery and threw the tunnel and up into the back of a truck. Then we'll need an open field for the plane to land. Boule, pick out a field for the plane. And we'll contact G2 in London and tell them the coordinates. And then, Gentlemen, you can say "Good bye" to General Stryker. And to me. What's the matter? You have a problem? You are the problem. Major Joseph Dawson. You are a fraud. You are not supposed to be here. But I am here and we're gonna get Stryker. No! No bet, no deal, no plan, nothing. Why the hell do you think you're here? I'm talking about a German General that could make the difference between killing and saving 1000's of lives. French lives. I'm talking about a General that could very well make the difference between winning or losing this war. Now this is France. This is your country. Have you got the guts to do this with me? Very patriotic. Very inspiring. For a mental patient. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Doesn't make any sense to have you... Last April, on the twenty fifth two people were dropped in the vicinity of Dover. One of them was a woman. The other an American agent. Their mission was to bring back General Willi Stryker. But their mission failed. And they and six members of the Maquis who were helping them were captured. And all of them tortured and killed. Did I say all? All but one. The American stayed alive. He returned to England. He was confined to a mental hospital. He boarded a plane en route to France, he attacked the agent who was supposed to come here and assumed his identity. No! No bets, no deal, nothing. Boule will be gone until morning. Get away from me. Now, don't start it cos you won't like the end. Tell me about the end. DAWSON: [EXHALING] Oh, yeah. I need you but you don't need me. Tell me. Trust me. No. YVONNE: Trust me. DAWSON: You want to know? YVONNE: Trust me. Do you really want to know? All right. There was a girl. They wanted to know her name. Her name. And they started working on my feet. My feet. They didn't break me from the top down. My stinking feet! I told them her name. I wanted to die and I tried to bash my head in against the wall. I couldn't use my feet. I couldn't get enough force. I knocked myself out. So they kicked me awake. They made me crawl down the hall into another room. They left us alone. They locked the door. They had beaten her face in. Her eyes were just slits. Jaw was broken. She made sounds at me. Oh, what sounds. Her tongue was half bitten off. Her blood was running out of her mouth. One ear was gone. Somebody had picked it up and put it in a coffee cup. I'll never forget that. Put it in a coffee cup! She lifted her head. Begged me. So I pulled myself up. I had to. I couldn't look at her. I got on my knees. I almost fainted. I got my fingers on her throat. And I turned away, I couldn't look at her. I was weak. But I managed to strangle her before they came back. No more. No more. I tried to kill myself three times before I escaped. Doesn't matter. You tried to kill yourself because you're human. Don't torture yourself anymore. - You don't understand... - Don't! I want you. I want you now. I make arrangement with the Rouen section. They get you back to England. No, I'm going after Stryker. You are? By yourself? You are crazy. But if you kill Stryker, yourself you are killed, then France win both ways. He will die. He is a fool. We are all fools. Killing has made the whole world an asylum. The others may not understand him but you should. Had he been born a Frenchman, his name would have been Boule. It's easy for you to say. But that woman who was with him, who was tortured and killed, would she be so understanding? I think so. She was his wife. Car's waiting, sir. Thank you. I hope the others will come and say "Goodbye." On Guard! Attention! # Sir, guard of honor ready for your inspection. The ceremony is always efficient, Major, but this time you outdid yourself. I know you like as little as possible, General. Yes, as little as possible. The motorcycle escort, the band... Tell me, do the regulations on military etiquette allow me this? Thank you. Present arms! [TRAIN HORN TOOTING] [TRAIN HORN TOOTING] Where was the trouble? Trouble? With what? But they've been trying to reach you in the dispatch office for the past ten minutes. # [PHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] # Cigarette? Russian? Oh, no. Thank you, General. I prefer French. Less taste but less bite. [CHUCKLES] [CLATTERING] [TRAIN HORN TOOTING] [ALARM WALING] Open the door. I have to get the General out. General, you won't be safe here. Follow me, please. Take us to the nearest shelter. Quickly. This way. [CROWD CLAMORING] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.A] [WOMEN SCREAMING] [EXPLOSIONS] We can go through here. General, you just changed sides. Captain! Shoot that lock off. The General's in there. You two, up there! [GUNFIRE] A daring plan carried out with military precision. My compliments. I didn't think I'd see you again. Nor I you. [WHISPERING] Road block. [HONKING] Motorcyclist. Pommard, take the road by the river. Jean, you go to the wheel and set the flares and wait. General, you got to take those off. We'll see you in the back of the mill. Come on. [HONKING] Pommard, try to run into something. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] I... Sergeant, my apologies. My driver, he is a cretin. He's an idiot. He could have killed us all. I... Your cousin, huh? I don't give him any job. I... I fire him. I kill him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was frightened. I teach you to be frightened of me. Let's go. Come on. The sewers come out here, here and at every second street. We're setting up roadblocks on all the roads leading out of town. We will run patrols in this area and here. Excuse me, Major. That morphine should be taking hold of you in a minute. I leave the perimeter security to you, but I'll handle the search. I want a company of men. Frankly, Major, do you think you're in any condition to do a competent job? I realize the General was more than a commanding officer to you? Yes. General Stryker was more than a commanding officer to me. And I promise you I'll find those who are responsible for his abduction. Abduction? Tell me, Major. Do you really think the General was taken against his will? And now what do we do? Pray. No sign of them yet. Keep watching. He will be here. You care about him? I think so. He is a different man than I thought at first. I thought he could feel nothing. You made him different. - And tonight he returns to England. - Oui. I will still be here. Thank you. [LAUGHS] Be patient. Hello, Dorothy B. The field is now ready. We'll await instructions from the aircraft. Very good. Stand by and wait for Merrimack. - So far, so good, yes? - Mm-hmm. What area have you covered? Everything south of the school, sir. We are checking the church now. Everything seems to be all right, Major. Then move your men to the next section... Sit here. It's all right. - Nothing else. - You better sit here for a few minutes, Major. Ah! Corporal, I would like to be alone for a moment. - Wait outside. - Yes, sir. No. This is Major Hessler, my aid and friend. General, I didn't want to believe it but it's true. Max, the war is over and you know it. It's just a question of how many more will die. Then it was all for nothing. Max, Germany has lost enough. If the war goes on God knows how much more will be lost. I can help that. We can help that. In England. You're asking me to come with you? There is no other way. No. There is another. Well, General, - good luck. - Max... Let's go. [RADIO STATIC] They should have been here by now. Patience. Patience. MAN: Merrimack this is Monitor. This is Monitor calling. Over. Merrimack this is Monitor calling. Please acknowledge. Over. Did the Germans see him? Merrimack this is Monitor. This is Monitor calling. Please acknowledge. Over. Jean, Monitor is calling you. Can you hear me? Can you read me, Jean? Jean, come in please. Monitor, stand by. We're trying to relay your message. Jean, do you read me? Monitor, please stand by. Jean, can you hear me? Jean, do you read me? Jean, do you hear me? Come in. [WHIRRING] First reading, 57 degrees. It's Jean. The Germans must have found the field. MAN: This is Monitor. Please acknowledge, old boy. Shall I hold or cancel mission? Over. I repeat. Cannot hold. I'm returning to base. I will report operation canceled. Over. Is there another field in the area big enough for that plane to land? No. No, my friend. There is none close enough. What about right here? The field behind us? It's surrounded by trees, We have no flares. We've got hay stacks. - And petrol in the truck. - Get it. Monitor, this is Merrimack. Come in. Monitor, this is Merrimack. Come in. MAN: Merrimack? Merrimack, this is Monitor. About time, old boy. Go ahead please. Over. Overshoot your target two miles south. Repeat two miles south. Roger that. We'll contact you in a few minutes. I'm sorry about Jean. It was nice being your wife. Even for a little while. [WHIRRING] St. Chaubain area. Boule, get the truck out on the field. Put more hay on those stacks. General, you better wait over there. Run over to the hay. The rest of you with me. All right. Run her on a straight line past those stacks. Okay. MAN: Merrimack this is Monitor. I'm approaching new area. All right, standby. We're preparing to guide you down. Roger. YVONNE: Boule! Boule, a German patrol. Paul, Pommard, German patrol. Cover the mill and the bridge. Tell, Emile. We give you as much time as we can. Just get Stryker back to England. Monitor, to Merrimack. There's an enemy patrol in the area. I'll have to delay the fires until I hear you overhead. MAN: Roger. Good luck. General! [SPEAKING GERMAN] We are under heavy fire. Request immediate attention. One, four, three, emergency. You better be worth it, General. [AIRCRAFT DRONING] Monitor, I can hear you. MAN: Making a final approach now, Merrimack. I'll pick you up on the far end. Looking for your lights. Looking for your lights. Well, standby. I'll show you where to put her down. Hey, Boule! Boule!
