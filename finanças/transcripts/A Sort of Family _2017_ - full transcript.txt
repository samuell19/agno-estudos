A SORT OF FAMILY Excuse me. You can go, Coca. - How are you, Costas? - What are you doing here? You could be a bit nicer, I've travelled 800 km non-stop. Did you come on your own? I want to see Marcela. Hadn't you changed your minds? No. We had a few problems, but here I am. Can I see her? Alright. Come. Thank you. We thought you weren't coming. I know. I'm sorry. This way. - Go in. - Thank you. Don't stay long. Hello. What are you doing here? I came to see you. You mess people around, Doctor. That's not true. I told you I'd be here and I am. Marcela, I came. What's the matter? My other children were born with no trouble. This one will be too. I'll be here with you... You say that and then you leave. I won't leave. - I won't leave. - Promise? I promise. I won't move. Can I? Yes. Can I ask you for something, Doctor? I want a chocolate croissant. They sell them in the corner stores. The corner stores. - How are you, Marcelita? - Good. Please leave, Doctor, she needs to rest. See you later. Room 34. 2nd floor, on the left. Breakfast is between 7 and 10 am. Thank you very much. That's all. Your identity card! - What? - Your identity card. Thank you. Start her on normal saline. The OR is ready. - Okay, help me. - Of course. Hello, Marcela. Relax. I'm going to help you. What are you doing here? Take this, Burgos. Where are you going? Don't worry. We're nearly there. Wait a moment, I'll come with you. Relax. Let's go. I'm feeling weak. God it really hurts! It really hurts! - Did you eat the chocolates? - What chocolates? - Did you eat them? - Yes, all of them. All of them? You were meant to be fasting! Please leave us alone. Didn't you tell her she had to fast? Let us do our job. Help! Please prepare this for me. Rita! Take her to the birthing room. I'll be right there. Let's go. I don't know what came over me. We've still got time. Doctor! Breathe. We'll do a vaginal birth. No cesarean? Her contractions are very close. We'll do a vaginal birth. - Are you sure? There's no risk? - Take her. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. I want to be there. Please. Please. I promise I'll be calm. Please. - Get changed. The clothes are there. - Thank you. Breathe. Breathe. That's good, carry on. Calm, baby's coming. - I can see it. - That's good. You're nearly there. Not long now. Soon, it won't hurt anymore. Breathe. Breathe. Go with the contraction. One more and baby is here. Go on, Marcela, push! Push hard! Again! That's great. You're doing so well. One more and it'll be over. - You're nearly there. - Go on, push! It's coming! Push! Go on, keep pushing! Keep pushing! Keep pushing! You did it. The baby's here! It's a boy. He's beautiful. Look at your baby. Do you want to see your baby? Do you? No, don't worry. How is he? Is everything OK? He's beautiful. He's very beautiful. He's very beautiful. - He has arrived, Mom. - Really? Are you there? - It was amazing. - How lovely! - You were at the birth? - Yes. That's wonderful! They let me go in, and I held him. - How exciting! - He is beautiful. I can't believe it! I can't believe it either. I want to see him, I'd love to see his face! Okay, I'll send you a photo. I'm so happy for you darling! Thank you, Mom. - But don't tell people yet. - I won't. - But... - When I get back, we'll see. - Yes, I'll wait... - Okay. - There she is. - Dr. Costas! What a surprise! - How are you? - Very well. I've come to ask you a favor. I need your help. - Of course. Come in. - Thank you. Bladía, my friend has just adopted a new born baby. She needs somebody to look after it, while she... completes the paper work. I thought of you. Would you be interested? Yes, of course. I would love to. - Did you have children? - Four, but they're adults now. So you can change diapers? Yes, I worked for 47 years at the hospital nursery. I certainly changed a few diapers! You didn't tell me she was a nurse. I forgot, Doctor. You should trust me more. - Sorry, I didn't know. - Don't worry. I'd love to hire you. I'll pay you well. It's my pleasure. A cat got in. It's mine. You left it inside? It could have suffocated. I didn't have anyone to leave it with. What about your husband? - He's travelling. - I thought he was working. He's on a work trip. Can you help me? Yes. Let me see. You know what you're doing. What is it called? Cat. Yes, the cat. What is it called? Cat. The cat is called Cat. What an inspired name! If you want, I can look after him until this is over. - You'll take him for a few days? - Yes. Thank you! Thank you, Costas. I'll give you his carrier. - Follow me, please. - Thank you. Come in. - How are you, Doctor? - Very well. Good. Dr. Costas told me that it all went very well. - Yes. It was perfect. I am pleased. - I'm happy for you. Thank you. Take a seat. I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Torres, one of Marcela's relatives. - Pleased to meet you. - A pleasure. Mr. Torres is here as he has something to tell you. You have been very good to Marcela. She hasn't lacked anything, everything was done correctly. We are very grateful. You don't need to thank me. But now there's a problem. Marcela doesn't know, we didn't want to tell her. What is the problem? Her husband has had an accident. And we need help, urgently. - What kind of help? - Marcela has three other kids to feed. With all this, we are really in trouble. Can you get to the point, I don't understand. Tell her, sir. With 10,000 dollars, we can come to an agreement. What? Do you realize what you're asking me? For you, this isn't a lot of money, Doctor. It would be a kind gesture to help the biological mother of your son. A kind gesture? I don't want money involved in my son's birth. - I didn't come here to buy. - That's not it. You're extorting money from me! This is a one-off request. The family has had a stroke of bad luck. What can we do? - What can we do? - Things happen. Things happen. It's life. What? - I didn't come to buy. - Doctor. Who are you looking for? Madam! Where is Marcela? In the bathroom. Come here. - Did you know about this? - What? Calm down. Do you know what they're asking me for? -Doctor. - No. Tell me the truth. Don't touch me! - Calm down. - Marcela, did you know? Did you all know? Is the baby okay? - Calm down. - Don't touch me. The police could come. Marcela, tell me the truth. - Enough. Calm down! - Don't let anyone touch the baby! I will report you! Let go of me! Calm down, please, Doctor. You can't scream in here. Calm down. Listen, babies here are mass produced. - Calm yourself. - That's enough. If you calm down, I'll let you go. Do you want this baby? Calm down. - Are you calm? - Let go of me. - You're calm? - That's enough, let me go. I'm okay. - Bring her a tranquilizer, Burgos. - Right away. You can't behave like that. It's my baby. - Relax, don't get worked up. - You can't take my baby away from me. Please, you can't do that to me. I couldn't cope. Help me. He's my baby. - I saw his little eyes. - Calm down. I saw his little face when he was born. Please. He's my baby. It's over, now. Thank you, Burgos. You may leave us. Take this. I'm his mother. I'm his mother. You must calm down, Doctor. You must speak with Mr. Torres. He's a good person, you're going to help him. Okay? But calm down. Are you feeling better? Did you have a rest? I'm very sorry about what happened. Mr. Torres didn't explain himself well. I also owe you an apology. Marcela's husband had an accident in Brazil. What happened? He ran over a woman with his truck. He's in prison. - Have you told Marcela? - Yes. I'm very sorry. We are going to give you the baby. It's what Marcela wants. But the situation has changed. The situation has changed? I understand. And I'm very sorry for you, but this has nothing to do with me. Tell yourself it's a contribution for the biological family. That wasn't part of the plan. I know. I came to get my child. Is your husband coming? My husband? Why? Your husband has to be here, Doctor. He is travelling, he can't come. We'll talk this through, man to man. We'll leave this here. The doctor will take some time to think this all through. - The father must come. - He will come. We'll speak to him. He'll be here as soon as possible. Don't you worry. If your husband doesn't come, there's no agreement. Aren't you going to say anything? What? It's your decision, isn't it? I need you to come. No, I won't come. We already discussed it. You must, it's important. This is nothing to do with me now. - If not, they won't give him to me. - Why won't they give him to you? Can you explain? - Help me, please. - Stop! Why won't they give him to you? What do they want? Can you tell me? - They asked me for money. - Money? I warned you. Why are they asking for money? A relative showed up, there's a problem. Of course! They're taking advantage of you. It's a mafia. What did they tell you? - Marcela's husband had an accident... - What a coincidence! They wait for the birth, you're alone and vulnerable. Can't you leave? Can't you see that they're using you? You may be right, yes. But we should see it as... - As what? - A contribution for the family. You know perfectly well they'll keep asking you for more money. You must put a stop to this and leave now! I won't leave here without my baby. Stop, Malena! Don't do this to yourself again! Help me, please! - Help me. - It's madness. I'm not asking you to take care of him. You don't have to do anything else, just help me with this. This is madness. They're taking advantage of you. Don't you see? They want 10,000 dollars. I'll give them back to you, I promise. - I'll give you the car, do you want it? - I don't want it! Why not? It's a good car. What are you talking about? Can you hear yourself? I beg you! If this goes wrong too, I think I'll die. Don't say that. Please, do you hear me? Come, I beg you. I'm not going back alone. Male! Do you want to hold him? No, thank you. Did Marcela hold him? No... She didn't want to get attached to him. She's right... Yes, I think she is... I'm not feeling good... What's wrong? I'm not normally like this... Look what I've got. Come here, darling. Come! It seems... he doesn't... he doesn't want to come. Stay a bit longer, he may come out. You're looking very elegant, Doctor. Thank you. I'm going to my uncle's daughter's wedding. He's pulling out all the stops. - Do you want to come? - No. Thank you. Sugar? It's in a very beautiful estate, near here. No, I'm going back to Buenos Aires. Did you speak to your husband? He doesn't think the money thing is a good idea. Even if it is to help the family... And what do you want to do? I don't know. I may have jumped the gun a little, I didn't know what I was getting into. I never thought it would be so complicated. It's the only way these decisions can be made, Doctor. There is no other way. You feel it in your guts, in your heart. Your head isn't involved. Don't be hard on yourself. I want to show you something. All of these children... have been adopted. These are their adoptive families. This little one is Tomás. Now, he has a family who loves him, who takes care of him. - These two? - Yes. Juan Carlos and María. You think I only do this for the money? I see children die at the hospital. The greatest tragedy of all, is poverty. Here, there, everywhere. Speak to your husband. Insist. Give it a try. I'll look after your cat. Hi. Is Mr. Ferreyra here? Not at the moment. What is it about? I heard he buys second hand cars. I'm afraid I don't know... Do you know anyone who'd be interested? I don't know. Is that the car you're selling? It's a good car. - How much is it worth? - 10,000 dollars. Hello. I've got a flat tire. - Could somebody help me? - Yes. Thank you. I don't really know where I am. I don't think I'm far from yours, but I'll pass you to someone who knows. Hold on for a bit, I'll be right there. No, send someone. I don't want to bother you. Darling, listen. I was trying to contact you. I spoke to your husband, yesterday. What did he say? We had quite a long chat. But I think I convinced him. He said he was on his way here. - Really? - Yes. Did he get the money? It seems so, yes. I am so happy, Doctor. I'm coming to get you now. Wait for me. Thank you very much, Costas. I'll pass you to María. María... Could you tell him where we are? Thank you. Hello. Hello, María, how are you? Where exactly are you? You know the gas station? Carry on up, on your right, until you reach Mario's sawmill. Mario Ledesma? That's right. Towards the Torta Quemada. What are you doing? You didn't respond... I'm sorry. I imagined the worst. Did you get scared? Go and see Rita. I told her you'd visit her. What about Torres? Torres and Rita work for the same person. Pernía. Don't get yourself into trouble. If you want to leave here with the baby, do what Rita tells you. Reverse a bit further. A bit more. That's it! - How are you? - Well, thank you. Come in. - I hear your husband is on his way. - Yes. That's good. You've decided to help Marcela's family. Yes. Congratulations. The baby will be registered in the names of Marcela and your husband. The fruit of an extramarital relationship, that he has accepted. In two years' time, you'll go to the law courts in Buenos Aires. You'll register him in your name, for the time you spent looking after him, protecting him. Do you follow me? Is that why my husband has to be here? Without him, we can't do the paperwork. And without the paperwork the risk is too high. Isn't there any other way? Do you want the baby? Yes, of course. So why are you having doubts? Doubts? I don't want the birth of my son linked to a lie. This isn't a lie. He's your son. It's just a form we have to fill in, this has to go through the courts. You're going to get a beautiful baby. If you don't take him, if you refuse, there are many other couples awaiting their turn. I have other options. Do you understand? You came. Yes, here I am. There's something I haven't told you. What? - What? - I don't know how to... Tell me. Apparently, the baby will only have your name. There's no other way. I don't know. Here she is. - Welcome, Doctor. - Hello. Hello. - I've got Torres's money. - Not here. The biological mother must carry the baby out. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten. One, two, three, four... - Hello. - Hello. Marce. - Hello, Torres. - You okay, Marce? My husband. Pleased to meet you. - Is he sleeping? - Yes. He is beautiful. Hello, baby. Shall we go? Please give Marcela the baby to get out of here, Doctor. Here, Marcela. Take him. I don't want to. Please, Marcela. Marcela, you must carry the baby out, it's a precaution. - I don't want to. - Please. - We don't have the choice. - Marcela... Calm yourself. - Be calm. Here, take him. - I am calm, but I don't want to. I don't want to. Please, take him. We have to leave that way. - You hold him. - You have to, she can't. - She can't. - Yes, she can. - Marcela... - I don't want to. - Why not? Take him. - I don't want to. Marcela, you must take him. - Do you want me to speak to her? - No. Leave it to me. I'll speak to her. What's the matter? - I'm speaking to you! - Don't touch me! - Take the baby, please. - I don't want to. - What do you mean? - Everything is unfair Doctor. Unfair? What do you mean? Those who have money, have everything. We never have anything. Never. - You think I have... - Don't touch me! You think I have everything? You're speaking to me? - I lack nothing? I'll shout if I want. - Don't shout. I can't touch him! I don't want to hold him. Did I come here to steal your baby? - Am I a bitch? - I didn't say that. - Then go and take him. - I don't want to, don't you get it? Stop shouting, that's enough. I don't want to. Leave me alone. I can't hold him, it's too unfair. I don't want to. Calm down. Stop, don't touch me! Calm down. You don't have the choice. You're going to have to calm down. That's enough. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. Don't worry. Please. - Forgive me. - It doesn't matter. It's okay. Please forgive me. Please. This is very hard for me. Forgive me. I swear to you... I swear I understand how hard it is. Put yourself in my shoes, I can't hold him. We have no choice. I can't, I'm sorry. I swear... Please, Marcela. Please. I brought you Cat. I wish you all the best. Good luck. Thank you for everything, Costas. - Why is Cat here? - I had no one to leave him with. - Hello. - I'm happy to see you. - How are you? - Good, and you? Very well, thank you. - We're here to register a birth. - Okay. All the documentation is here. I'll check it. Okay. Yes, everything is in order. - Are you married? - No. One moment, I'll take note of all that and register it on the computer. Yes. Promise you'll take care of him? I'll take the best care of him. He's the apple of my eye. Be happy. Hush, hush, hush... This is wonderful! Hello, my darling. Let's try to get him to sleep. Shall we go? Male. Male! There's a police check. Wake up, there's a police check. Wake up. Give me Pedro's documents. The documents? Here they are. Listen. - Let me do the talking. - Okay. What do we tell them if they question us? That you had this child with another woman, that I've forgiven you... I've agreed to raise him with you and we're going home to Buenos Aires. What about the mom? She's not here. I know, but where is she? He's a newborn. She's in the hospital, recovering, she'll join us later. That's too weird, it doesn't add up. What do you mean weird? It worked at the registry office. The birth certificate says you're the biological father. Didn't you realize they were all in cahoots with each other? - They're going to take my baby away. - No. Stop! We'll think of something. We have to do something. - I have 900 pesos. - No, we're not going to bribe anyone. We're not the first or the last to go through with a baby. I'm not giving anyone another penny. Is that clear? No way. - I'm going to hide him. - What? - You're completely crazy, I swear. - If they see him, they'll question us. - How are you going to hide him? - It's okay. I'll cover him with this. - He'll suffocate. - No he won't! You're barking mad, I've only just realized. - This is crazy. - Pass me Cat. No. Pass him to me, please! Why did I get myself into this? I can't believe it. What are you doing? Stop acting suspicious. Look at me. - Don't offer them money. - Okay. Have you got a cigarette? No. Shit. Drive on. Drive on, please. Drive on. Stop here, please. Good evening. - Good evening. - Where are you going? Buenos Aires. Vehicle registration, driving license and insurance. The car insurance is in there. Here are... the documents. And the insurance. - Where have you come from? - 25 de Mayo. - The reason for your trip? - My cousin's wedding. You broke a window? - Yes... - An accident. - Can we go? We're in a hurry. - I have to work tomorrow. - He's not a happy cat. - He doesn't like being confined. - Nobody does. - It's a pain. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. Get out of the car. - What? - Get out. Benítez! What is it? I can hear a baby. Get out of the car. But it's not... Get out. Hands on the hood. Here are his documents. Get out of the car. Hands on the hood. The baby's name is on them and... The baby's name? We can explain. Did you give him the documents? Hands on the hood! - It's his biological son. - Hands on the hood! Okay, I get it. - The baby is fine. - Hands on the hood! - The baby is fine. - Hands on the hood! Drive on, please. I knew this would end badly. Then why did you come? - I was afraid. - Afraid? Of what? - That you'd do something stupid. - Something stupid like this? I came to help you. Help me? This is how you help me? I came to help you. I was afraid you'd do something stupid. I didn't force you. What have I got to do with this crazy idea of yours? Look where it got us! Look where it got us! You blame me for the death of our son. What? No. He was stillborn. I never said it was your fault. We were unlucky, that's all. You blame me. No. No I don't blame you. It's you who can't forgive yourself. I can't take anymore of this bad luck! Male. My dad's on his way. He'll help us get out of this. You'll see. Eat. After talking it over with Mr. Estévez and Ms. Pernía, I understand that you acted on impulsion, unaware that you were committing a crime. I was also informed about the tragedy that you recently experienced, and I have no intention of adding to your pain. If we've done something wrong, it wasn't our intention. We are sorry. Listen to the judge. Carry on. So... I won't bring any charge against your clients. But from today on, you are formally prohibited from initiating any adoption procedure in this jurisdiction. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Where is Pedro? He's been placed in a home. I'm very sorry, Malena. Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye, thank you. Bye. The tribunal sent me to meet with the children. The tribunal? That's strange. Who sent you? The judge. - Judge Rípodas? - Yes, Judge Rípodas. They didn't say anything to me. I don't know anything about this. I'll make a phone call. - Wait here for me. - Okay, thank you. Hello. Can you come here, I've a question for you. Hello. - Has he been here long? - He arrived yesterday. Yesterday? - Can I hold him for a moment? - Yes. What are you doing? - Have you been here for long? - Yes. A long time? - What's your name? - Belén. Belén? I can't take you with me. I would have loved to. They won't let me. Nearly there. Hush, calm down. Here we are, calm down. Don't cry, my little one. It will all be okay. Calm down. It will be okay, you'll see. We'll be okay. You'll see. We'll be okay. It's okay, it's okay. Let's see... There we go. Come here. You are so beautiful. What are you doing here? Can we talk? I've got nothing more to say to you, Doctor. Can I come in, please? I must talk to you, Marcela. Go away. - Please. - Go away. Go away. Let me come in. - Please. I need to talk to you. - You don't understand. - I have to talk to you. - Go away, I told you. Please, Marcela. Hello. Hello. Go see Granny. Mommy will be there in 5 minutes. Go see Granny. Over there. Mommy's coming. I couldn't leave him there. - I couldn't leave him there, all alone. - Find another solution. - He'll be better off with you. - No, it's too difficult. - He won't lack anything with you. - We had an agreement. You haven't helped me. That's obvious. - Look at how I live. - I'm sorry. - I don't know... - I'm sorry. Why are you doing all this? Why? Why? He'll be better off with you. He'll be better off with you.
