Captain Alex, is it true you will lead the hunt for Tiger Mafia? When will you arrest Tiger Mafia? Very soon. The Mafia's on the run. Sir, is Kampala safe? Don't be stupid. What does the President think? The President hired the best man for the job. Me. Please, one more question - Where is the Mafia hiding? Enough. We have real work to do. Back off. Please, Captain. Captain. This is the best space I have. I'm sorry, but Wakaliga is a very small village. This is fine. But, this is our sewage. I'll be in my office. Let me know if you need anything. I'll warn you when I use the toilet. Sergeant - | want to see base camp in 20 minutes. Robert. Come here. - Are you deaf? - I'm coming. Dig a row of tent posts along this line. Don't screw it up. And over here - we'll build a wall and gate. Get to work. Lazy bastards. Why aren't you with the men? I'm preparing the mess. What about the local cook we hired? | don't know. Vicki didn't come. Ssali, I want you with the others as soon as you're done. Finding Tiger Mafia won't be easy. They are close. I feel it. Perhaps hidden by their families. But we must be very careful. A caged tiger is the most dangerous. Where's the music? We need music. It's like a funeral in here. Know what I think? The girls in Wakaliga are cute. | bet they're dying for real men like us. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present - tonight's special entertainment - Natasha! What the hell's going on? Where's your discipline? Down. Get down. Don't move. - Who are you? - Yo mama. This village welcomes you and this is how you behave? Get down. The villagers started it. If you can't handle yourselves here - what will happen in combat? Look at you. You call yourself a soldier? Back to camp. Over here. Hurry up. We have to be quick. Let's go. Let's go. You got the stuff? Let's see it. - How's it going? - It's all good. You sure? - Where you going? - Short call. Have fun. Hands up. There's no escape. - See you around. - Take care. Peace. Time for action. Hello? We need backup. Over. | got you, man. Go. Go. Don't let them escape. Don't worry. I'll get us out. Come on, jackass. Stupid. This is Catalina for Ramon TV - Wakaliga, Nateete with important breaking news. In a deadly battle, Captain Alex and his commandos captured the brother of Richard, the most wanted man in Uganda - and leader of the Tiger Mafia. The Mafia narrowly escaped. Captain Alex promises to capture Richard in just a few days. Stay tuned for updates on Captain Alex, Richard, the Tiger Mafia, and other important news. This has been a special news update. Thank you for watching Ramon TV. Not my brother, Martin. What's wrong? My brother's been captured? Captured? What happened? Your brother fights like a bitch. And where was Puffs? Puffs was helping me, plus he got the briefcase. But I don't need you! | have dozens of wives - but only one brother. A man should take care of himself. And when were you gonna tell me? | find out from the TV? Get everyone together! Oh, no. Martin. Hello? Puffs? Richard knows. He found out? How? Some idiot on the TV. Oh, God. It's on the news? We're on our way. He's gonna kill us. All of us. Listen - when Richard comes, don't say anything. None of this is my business. | just want my money. You don't understand. You'll see. He's completely crazy. It was a surprise attack. Where's the stuff? The briefcase is safe. As the leader of this base, what do you have to say? Alex's soldiers were well-trained. There was nothing we could do. And what about my brother? | was able to save the briefcase, as well as your beautiful wife. What did you say? Instead of my brother, you saved this bitch? Who's the bitch? | want you to bring me Captain Alex. And you, bastard - I want my brother. Get out of here! | told you. Now what do we do? He won't stop 'til we're all dead. I'm a mercenary from Russia. | don't deserve this. | came here to kill. If you don't give me people to kill, I give up. It'll be all right - We just need a plan. The boss shouldn't see us like this. Come here. Where's our spy? She's coming. Alex's men needed her. I'm worried sick. | pray it's not too late. My brother's so sweet. And has a beautiful voice. Bad news, sir. Your brother's been transferred. He's now at Police Headquarters, in the city. And what about Captain Alex? Alex is my bitch. I'm with him every night, in his tent. | want you to bring me Captain Alex. | want Alex here tonight. Tonight. And you, Puffs - | killed a wife because of you. Don't screw this up. Go on. Get out of here! Richard. What are you doing here? Ask me again, asshole! | want my baby brother! You don't understand. | have no power any more. It's all different with Captain Alex here. You think I'll just sit back - as you try to eat me, as if I were a juicy grasshopper? Why should I lie? Believe me. Alex has complete control over me and the Police. - Suck my dick. - Just get out. You can't intimidate me. And know this, you diarrhea squirt - | will get my brother back. By the way, we're short on guns. No, those aren't mine. That's not funny. I'll give them a good home. Where are you going? This is good stuff. That's not for you. Is the Captain here? You want the Captain? Hello, Vicki. Good to see you. You are late. | needed to take care of something, but I just had to see you. In fact, nothing could stop me. You look great. My darling. No, I will never stop. Not until we finish our mission. We must capture Richard and destroy the Tiger Mafia once and for all. You know what? First take a bath. And when you come back, I'll have a surprise waiting. A surprise for me? A very special one. It better be good. Hand me the towel. | hate bathing. A soldier should only be naked around other soldiers. It's natural. And he should always bathe with his gun. | carry mine everywhere. That's good to know. Even to the toilet. - Stand up. - Sit down. Okay, just get up. It's all set. He's on his way. Alex is dead. What do you mean? He's been shot. Are you kidding me? | was in his tent, and then I heard him scream. This is crazy. Who are these idiots? We heard a shot. But where's Alex? Get in the truck. - Go, go. - I said move. Get your ass up. What happened? Sergeant. The Captain is dead. What did he say? It's true. He's been shot. Robert! The killer must still be here. Turn this camp upside-down. - Search everywhere. - Yes, sir. Well, do it! Who do you think killed Captain Alex? It has to be Ken and John. They went AWOL last night. | think it was the Mafia. This was revenge for our attack. Then how did they get in our camp? And where are the missing soldiers? Come in. Do you hear me? - They're not answering. - Shit. Do you hear something? Maybe they're coming back. Put it away. Put it away. What are we gonna do? We need to act. This is the brother of Captain Alex. He has some questions about the murder. Good to meet you, Sergeant. Do you have any suspects? Hard to say. It's early in the investigation. May I join the investigation? Puffs - You failed me twice. How do you think that makes me feel? Why don't I see Captain Alex? Someone got there before us and killed Captain Alex. But at least we captured two of his soldiers. Mercenary - What the hell happened? Are you crazy? You want money for this? Did YOU kill him? No way, boss! It wasn't me! Please don't kill me! Think of all my Russian kids. Bring the hostages. May I see his tent? Help yourself. - This one? - You got it. You believe this guy? Civilians. Alex's brother is an idiot. He's playing detective. They all think war is easy. "Welcome to Dangerous Zone" Who Killed Captain Alex? | don't know, sir. Did these clowns kill him? No, sir. They didn't. The shot came from the other side. Someone else must have killed him. | didn't see anything. I don't know who killed Captain Alex. Who killed this man? Tell me or die! | found something. Listen to this! Listen, listen. Dasvidaniya It's a tracking device. Whose tracking device is this? It belongs to Ken. That means they were captured. You failed me. | did everything according to plan. Alex was killed before we could act. There was nothing we could have done. That's what I want to know. We've been patient with you. You're a civilian. This is a military matter. Master. Master. Where are you going? Who are you? What do you want? | want to see the Master. - Master who? - Don't be an idiot. Pussy. Why are you here? Master, I need your help. With what? | need to avenge my brother's death. Please - the Martial Arts are not for revenge. They are for self defense and physical fitness. It's impossible. I will not help you. Master, my brother was a great man. You must go. Good morning, sirs. Good morning. Where have you been, Vicki? Get to work. The men are hungry. Why don't we chop her head off? It's better to do nothing. With luck, she'll lead us to Tiger Mafia. Only if she doesn't get suspicious. Still, why would Richard lie about killing Captain Alex? | don't know. But, if Richard is innocent - then we have an assassin hiding among our own men. What's wrong? Some water. Please. Drink. What happened? | don't remember. Is that a bullet wound? Put this on. Don't bleed on it. Put this on the wound. It'll stop the bleeding. We are all angry about the murder of Captain Alex. And we will have revenge. | promise. Who do we kill first? | know the perfect Commando. He's a great leader. And ruthless. His specialty is drug dealers. Where has he killed before? Anywhere Mafias have been a problem. For example - Colombia, where he chopped the head off a major drug dealer. And Russia - and Pakistan. Anywhere he is needed, he Kills. There's no one better. And right now, he is here in Uganda on vacation. If he's that good, we could sure use him. With him, we will crush the Tiger Mafia once and for all. Can I eat this one, too? Do you know why you're here? No, sir. You're gonna tell the world who | am - Richard, the Tiger Mafia. - Son. - Yes, sir? Please put on Ramon TV. It's time for News. Bring the hostages. Connect me to Ramon TV. Now. Do it now! Hello? Studio 8 - connect me Live. Start the broadcast. We are Live from Tiger Base. This special report - Stop. Stop. This is Richard, the Tiger Mafia. | want my brother. | want him right now! | have hostages and I'm gonna start killing. | want my brother right now. Get up. | want my brother. | want my brother! | want my brother. | want my brother. Are you deaf? | want my brother! This has been a special report. For Ramon TV, this is Kyaaka Sophie from Tiger Base. Lieutenant - | want that reporter from Ramon TV. Unless he is stopped right now, I'm certain Tiger Mafia will kill again. Can you take us to their base? | was blindfolded, but I'm sure we can find their base together. Hey, wake up! Get the commandos! We're gonna attack. We're gonna attack right now! Where have you been? With a wife? Do you live in the bush? Why did Tiger Mafia try to kill you? Tiger Mafia? Why would you say that? | saw your tattoo. Do you work for them? No, I'm just a wife. Why did they try to kill you? | don't know, but I was in love. Now you must decide. Marry me - or die. Get me an answer. When's the wedding? | don't know. You don't know? How about now? Where's it gonna be? Here's your invite. That the best you can do? Wanna see what I can do? Have you decided? What's your answer? Who's your husband? Richard the Tiger Mafia. Richard the Tiger Mafia? You're gonna take me to their base. If you like, but you won't make it. It's too well-guarded. This is Rock, the new Platoon leader. He's as good as Captain Alex, and will plan the attack. We are ready, sir. | need to make a call. Richard - I'm gonna leave my phone on. How many soldiers do we have? 50 commandos, sir. We need a chopper. Drug dealers - I know how they think. We need to attack very early - because I'm on vacation and want to go dancing later. Maybe go to the beach. That sound good to you? This is crazy. - What's wrong? - It's too much. It's just one man. This is a military operation. Let's pretend the Police isn't here. Real mature. See here - this is where they expect an attack. Instead, we'll come from the North. The infantry will base in this forest. We'll need machine guns. | want a sniper here. | told you - stop following me. Look out! Wait for me. Oh, for God's sake. | don't know how you let the Captain get killed. You knuckleheads stay far away from me. And remember - chop the head off Richard the Tiger Mafia. Got it? This is no time for jokes. The Captain was caught with his pants down. Remember your training and don't shoot each other. Captain Alex was an idiot. Anyone you see is a treat. The Mafias look stupid, but they've killed more people than you. Now, pretend to listen - We will crawl through their sewage. The trenches will lead us to their toilets. They are operating from what looks like an old grade school. We'll attack from the playground with the chopper. My spies confirm - that this attack will be a complete surprise to Tiger Mafia. Steal a helicopter from the Police. Yes, sir. | want you to bomb the city. Create a distraction. They love Uganda more than they hate me. Understand? What are you looking at? Guard the base. The military is about to attack. Right now? Yes, now. With choppers. Choppers? Who's there? Who are all these people? They're my new men. Do you trust them? Very much, sir. Move. Who's this? That's my nephew, Bob. Never trust anyone! - Are you scared? - No, sir. Never mix business with pleasure. Yes, sir. What are you good at? Fighting. - What's this? - A trespasser. Back to your post. One-by-one, show me your skills. Faggots. Gimme all three. Hello? Hello? I'm over Kampala. Bomb anything big and important. | see a glass building ahead. Destroy it! Destroy it! What is it? Commandos. We have to tell Richard. Drop your guns or I'll shoot. Bitch. How dare you still live? I'm serious. I'll do it. I'm not joking. | like your style. Boss. We're surrounded. So, do something! What are you doing here? Go back and fight! Puffs - these are your skilled fighters? Move, move. Oh, Jesus Christ. Dasvidaniya, Commrade. Hello? Hello? Chopper. Chopper. Where are you? Chopper. We're here - The forest is too damn thick. | can't see you. Zero-Eight-One. Zero-Eight-One. Over. OK, I got it. Let's hope I don't kill you. There's Tiger Mafia! | got him! I got him! Don't hurt my jacket. Hold him like a goat. We deserve a raise. At noon today a Police helicopter bombed the Workers House building in Kampala. The Police and Military have been mobilized. The identity of the terrorist is not yet known. Ugandans are fearful and fleeing the city. The Government has yet to make an official statement. Are you watching the TV? Yes, Minister. I am. What is the security situation in Kampala? The city is completely safe - believe me. Ugandans enjoy Martial Law. Please stay tuned for updates. For Ramon TV, this has been Naluwooza Jackie.
