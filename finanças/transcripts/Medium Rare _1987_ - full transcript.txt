This guy Lou, I don't know the kid. But I heard he has respect for the old-timers. You know- shall we call oourselves the pioneers? You were the best filmmaker, boss. You made the best films with Helga. He may be planning some event, you know like maybe a symphonism of all my stuff together. Ya. I might give advice. If he has a script or a screenplay, I might tell him how to do a little curlicue. But no active day-to-day stuff. Don't you want to get back involved, a little bit, nice? Look, you always have that instinct, but, leave it for the younger men. Those were the years, remember? Beautiful! Good times, you know. Remember when you first came about? Yea. You remember the title of the movie? Ya, good days. It was called CABIN FEVER haha Oh Siegfried, the scenery of your native country is so beautiful! You made this thing? Your scenery is not so bad either, Fraulein! I certainly know what to do with my pole... (Harry laughs) She's a classy broad! They don't make em like that anymore. Bend the knees! Shift the weight. Yavol schatzi! Yavol! (Harry laughs) Careful Shatzi! Oh Siegfried! I've seen enough, Harry. The best part's coming up. Film's like this haven't played in 15 years. Lou, she's a very beautiful woman. Don't forget that. What, have I got to spell it out to you? Your wife is a relic.... And you are a relic... So, what are we having this meeting? What are you getting at here? Harry. I found a new Helga. An 18 year-old... I thought so, you little prick! Listen to me...ok? There's only one Helga! You hear? And she's my property! And she only does films for me. And I'm retired. So that's the end of the story. Harry, sweetheart...what're you gonna do, huh? Stop us? We are already in production. I'm offering you a piece of the action. OK. Let me tell you something...Ya? You try to do a Helga film, I'll finish ya! You're gonna finish me? You're the one who is finished, Harry Costas! I am the new breed of Hollywood! Fuck You! Fuck you! I certainly wouldn't fuck her! That little son of a bitch wants to do a Helga movie. There's no fucking way! How can he do a Helga movie without Helga? Exactly, because you're going to stop him, Mole Don't worry, boss. I'll take that fucking cameraman... and I'll shove the camera so far up his ass that he'll choke on it. I don't want anybody hurt, ok? I want you to go to his studio and wreck the shit out of all the equipment. But don't hurt no one, Mole. You got to crack 'em boss, they don't listen. Did you hear what I said? Do you want to go back up to that nice place on the river? Alright, alright. Do just what I said, wreck the equipment. (singing) Because I heard it all before, and I'm down there on the floor... No one's ever going to keep me down again.... ooooohhhhh! You're flat! Oh shut up. What do you know? Listen, I heard plenty of crooners when I was on Broadway, and I'm telling you - you're flat. Oh ya? Well I'm not that flat. Come here Alfie, honey, come on. Come here, baby, what the matter? You have to be quiet. You want to go peeps? Hi honey. How'd it go with Lou? It couldn't be better. (dog barking) Mama! Take them for their peeps and their poops. Harry don't be mean to Alfred! Harry, will you stop it! You ready? I thought you said.... I did, but it's 200 bucks for driving half a mile. Ya, 200 bucks for doing what? That's what I want to know. It's not like we're robbing a bank. It's just a little job, that's all. That's the mole, let's go. I'll be right out, man. Money is money. I love you. Wait here. Be ready to bolt. Let's go people, I've got 3 cum shots to do by midnight.

Damn pinhead you! 3 people dead? (farts) Nasty business huh? Here, we found this. Helga goes Hollywood. Looks like we got it all on tape. Oh boy! Looks like a snuff film I'll bring the popcorn. Who was that? I don't know. Some guy said he knew Timmy. Said he wants to talk to me. You never should have gone there. Hey. My brother didn't mean to hurt nobody. It was the Mole's fault. I think you should go to the police. What if this guy's dangerous? Maybe he knows something! bonding, domination, whipping, humiliation...fetishes... Bye honey, I'm taking the children out for a walk. Will you stop calling them 'children'. Oh Harry. My daughter loves those dogs They're like the children you weren't man enough to give her. $10 off regular waterbed massage... (fighting) singing- the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.

You knew my brother? Ya I want to tell how how sorry I am for what happened last night. It was a terrible tragedy. Unfortunately there's nothin we can do to bring him back. I told you we should have gone to the cops. No! What would you have to go to the police? We can work this out for ourselves. Stop right there. What do you mean work this out? My brother is dead and somebody's going to pay for it! Relax, kid. Relax. You know, you and your brother were breaking the law... What do you think the cops are going to say about that? See! I told you so. Shut up! Don't squabble. Here. We can straighten this out. I know how hard it is when you're starting out and you're young. Helga and I, we were young once too, I don't believe he's trying to buy us off, Mitch. I don';t know what your problem is... But I'm going to the cops! Hi Honey, we're back. The babies did their poops. I'm glad. Listen Mole. That kid was here. No. He's going to the cops. Listen, I retired at the peak of my career. Ya.

What the hell did you do? Crying. No, you didn't.... I did. You did? An honest mistake sweetheart. It could have happened to anybody... (soundtrack from the porn shoot) So Mike, how are you going to find the drillers? Same way I find everyone. I just sit on my ass... until.... something falls into my lap. Here we got a kid who want to talk. Says he knows who did it. Well, should we go find him? What's the hurray? Let's watch the rest of this. snoring So, what up doc? I gave a small dose to the animal, he'll be up and about in a short while. Thats wonderful It's a pity about the other dog in the microwave. A modern day tragedy. But at least she didn't suffer, you know what I mean? When it's time to go, who could ask for a better way? You know you've got a point. Hey, lose some weight. Should have fried you, too. You little shithead. I'll bet you had a hand in Fifi's death. I wish You give new meaning to the words low-life scumbag. Why don't you crawl back into your whole, you old hag?

What are ya deaf or something? Give me a statement! Come on now Mitch. What are you deaf? Sorry i took so long Mitch. Would you like to see what happened? No, I want a statement from this man. Extraordinary. Maybe to you. But to me he's just a mug who won't talk! Are you alright honey? Ya, he's alright. Maybe you can get him to talk. God, he looks awful. Did you even feed him? What d'ya think? His nervous system has been exposed to some terrible trauma. We could use the electric shock treatment... You can't do that, he's not a guinea pig. It would be very interesting. We're going home. Stop that, you can't do that! He's still under arrest! But he didn't do anything. I'm afraid you are going to have to leave. Listen, I know what happened. I'll give you a statement so you can leave us alone. Will you stop looking for for your brain in there and listen to me. You want to make a statement? OK. You can come into my office and make a statement. Hey doc, keep an eye on him. Let's get a little reaction here... You weren't there. What's the difference? You know who did it. You know sweetheart, I'm beginning to lose my patience with you. Alright. Go ahead, take your Romeo, feed him some chicken soup, get out of here. Up you go......good! wait....wait Here honey, why don't you just sit down and relax. Do you want to wear this jacket? Put your arms in here. Good. Oh that looks wonderful! Mitch, hey wait honey.

Take a look at this new flick that came out. Tell me what you think. Where did the romance go? We always used to have romance. Well I suppose it turns on some people. Now, give me her medicine. How about I give you a little bit more than medicine? Don't be fresh. Just let me have it. I'll let you have it. Where do you want it? Ah! Stop that! She's right in there, in the bath tub. Sure she is. Sure she is... That turns you on. Tell me the truth. from the window- Harry! ahh! Harry! Alfie! Alfie where are you going! I found your medicine! I'm just coming now!! Oh Harry! Your such an animal... screaming Whats the matter buddy? Hey stop that Alfred, you're a naughty, naughty boy. Remember what they said about the hand that feeds you... Alfred, stay calm. Where you going Alfred? Sit. Nice boy Alfred... Whoa! You're a crumb Harry Costas! What's she smiling about? I'm trying to figure that out myself. Looks like a case of soiled panties to me. Soiled panties? Don't worry. This is one of those painless needles. You'll never feel a thing. Now let me get this straight, Harry. You're saying that this friend of your wife's just fell through that window? Is that what you're saying? Exactly. And then what happened? And then- I told you that. That little bastard dog comes jumping after me, I ducked away, and he went through the window... And that, ah....that little chunk that's missing from your ass... What about that? You know at first, I thought maybe, maybe the dog bit your ass. then I thought maybe your wife bit your ass. But it could have been the victim that bit your ass,,, Which one was it, Harry? Fuck you! My wife don't bite anybody's ass. Hey! Don't ever say FUCK to me! Why not? Everybody else does. No they don't. I got news for you, Harry. I could bring you in right now. I know all about the porn shoot. I just don't want to spend all my day in court. I'm going to wait until I can bring you in in a body bag. You got that? You got nothing on me. I want an autopsy on the woman. and the dog The dog? Ya. Our friend the TV dinner. He's lost his bark, but not his bite. I need you over here pronto, buddy. Boss, I'm about to eat dinner. Ya so? Harry I got that waitress over here. I'm about to fuck her brains out. Why didn't you say so? Fine. But just make it quick. Doctor... Same lobe- 5 centimeters deeper. Cooked. Drugs. What's this world coming to? Unfortunately Scotty this has nothing to do with drugs. This brain has undergone some sort of transformation process. The only remaining functional segment is the primordial reflex centrum. Primordial reflex centrum. Wouldn't that control the primitive needs for food, survival and sex? Precisely! And it could be triggered off with a simple application of electric current. Electricity is like anger, you know. It incites violent behavior. This is no ordinary pooch, Scotty! It's the human baked potato. (laughs) Wines already opened, numbnuts! girl screams Help! Murder! Murder! Hey baby! Wanna go for a ride? Oye! Hey Puta!!!! Murder! There's a murder!! Help me! Help me! Murder!!!!! You match the hair with the eyes with the lips with the nose until we find the guy. He's not in this book. Here's a new one for you Mike. The murder weapon was a CO2 cartridge He picked the Mole right up off his feet, like he was a wimp. The Mole just died and you got me looking at other guys... Harry, come over here? You know this guy? Is that him? Ya, he tried to kill me! And all of a sudden he stopped. Then what? Then I got the fuck out of here, and some biker asshole tried to rape me! And where were the cops? Nowhere! Bit now you're all here, being totally macho! OK Harry. Are you ready to come clean yet? I got nothing to say. That's fine with me, Harry. Because I know that in the end, I'm going to bring you in. The longer you stay out, the greater the chances are that when you come in, it's going to be like that. You should have stayed in the porn racket. Murder's out of your league. You got nothing on me. Harry, not tonight. I have to save my energy for tomorrow. Go to sleep Harry. Are you alright? Of course I'm not alright. You come crashing through this door, carrying a knife and looking like Charlie Manson. Of course I'm not alright. Harry, could you close that window? I think I'm catching a sore throat. I'll get you a cough drop. Harry, what am I going to do if I catch a sore throat? Well that never stopped you before honey. You're such a pig, Harry. I'm not talking about that. Could you put that cigar out Harry, you're choking me. You know Willy, at the Silver Fox? He's going to let me sing tomorrow night, in his variety show. And there's going to be agents there, and producers from Vegas. Bookers. And then- you know my real, real dream? is to sing at the Mink Lounge. The Mink Lounge on Sunset? Here kid. About 5 minutes. Today? Today! man comes in here and says - TODAY! You can't get shit done today. You promised me a hit. And I want me a hit. This is my boy, Rosco. I promised him a hit. I like the weird shit, and you promised me. laughs Kids, they're all the same. Ain't they Harry? So, you going to the job for me? This is really great. You know, you letting me do this hit. Ya ya kid. Since we're on this father/son vibe, can I share something with you? What you talking about, boy? This car is whacked man. It looks like its from a 1970 superfly, TNT, black exploitation film. You look like Willy Dynamite driving this car. We should get you a fresh Benz, man, or a Suzuki Samarai or something. Haven't you heard? You are what you ride. laughs Ah shit, we got company. You creep! Where have you been? How dare you leave me like this! Oh honey. Are you ok? Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Please forgive me. Please talk to me. tell me what's wrong. Ya, that's good. That's it. Good. Fabulous. Kyle here. Sure, I remember you. That's remarkable. OK We'll do it. Scotty, put Alfred away now, but leave the electrodes set up. Extraordinary. Whats extraordinary, Doctor? The electricity seems to be reviving his body. Remember how flat he was when we brought him in? Ya wow! You're right. Scotty, I'm always right. Look at this. You got 2 people up against each other like sandwiches. Now how you going to shoot one without shooting the other unless you got brakes on the bullet? Come on honey, come on. We're going to go see the doctor. There he goes inside! You fucked up my hit again! Where we at? Who cares where we at? Rosie, let me explain this to you. We think...we hope, that this electric current will stimulate him. Let's give it a try, shall we? It's working! It's working! Come on, Mitch. You can do it. Give it more juice! .5 Watts 1.5 watts Don't over-do it. Listen, this may be nothing but neuro-electric auto-gyrations. But he's getting better! I know it! I can see it! Turn it up! What'd did you turn it off for? Kyle here. Yes, sir. You're doing great sweetie, just keep it up a little longer. I know you can make it. Where's that file on the Simpson strangulation? Mitch! What happened? I turned the juice up a little bit more, that's all... I just wanted to help him. Come on, let's go. He must of run out the back. Let's get his ass! Honey that's the trouble these days. People just don't know how to act their age. They should grow old with dignity and class. Momma, just shut up, please? This is when I need your support the most. Baby, you don't need anybody's support. You got the firmest ass in Hollywood. Harry! You like it? There's nothing quite like a designer original. Even though its a lot more expensive. You like it really? I had it made just for you, teddy bear. It's a one of a kind! You're going to knock em dead sweetheart. It's great about Helga's comeback. Tonight's the only comeback that kid's going to see. Wily I got my fuck-you money. I'm retired! That's what I love about you Harry Once a scumbag, always a scumbag. You got that buddy. Oh shit. Hello Harry You're looking particularly oily tonight. Thank you very much, sir. William, how about a front row table for our friend, Lt. Hill. And anything the man wants on my tab. Wow. What's with all this hospitality, Harry? I'm feeling very generous. Helga's performing this evening. Really? Hey - she's not taking off her clothes is she? Why don't you just sit down, ok? And don't cause no trouble. It's Helga's big night. You knock em dead, baby! You knock em dead too, Harry. Oh, I'm so nervous. practices her scales. (singing) They're in my dress!

Stop it! Where's everyone going? I'm singing! Harry, stop it. This is my big night! This is my opening night, honey. I waited my whole life to go on tonight! What are you doing to me! I'm calling my lawyer in the morning. I'm going to divorce you, Harry. I'm going to take you for everything you got. I'm going to take you right to the cleaners. I should have listened to my mama. She always told me you was a crumb. You don't deserve this you know. You really don't. You deserve better than this. Well I did it all for you. Ya sure. There was this creep making a Helga movie. What'd you say? There was this low-life trying to film a Helga flick. That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. How can you make a Helga movie without Helga? Somebody did that to me- I'd kill 'em. Thats what I did. Only a lot of people ended up dead. People were killed on the set, and then the Mole got killed. Ya, well why didn't you tell me, huh? Because I didn't know how to break it to you. I felt like a jerk. Then this kid wanted to go to the cops, so I put his head in the microwave so he wouldn't talk no more. laughs - You know what I thought you said - I thought you said you put his head in the microwave so he wouldn't talk no more. Ya, like Alfred can't bark no more. Like Alfred can't bark no more....? (door noises) You're a son of a bich, Harry. That's what you are! Good damn you! You cooked my Alfie!

No! Give me the gun! Give it to me! Alright girls. We don't need any more blood here. Oh yes we do! I love you woman, but I'll blow you away. If I have to. You don't really mean that Harry Scotty, I think we're about ready. Let's go and give the detective a little demonstration. Yes sir. Mike, I've got a breakthrough for you. Doc, the case is closed. Don't you understand? The witness is dead. No witness, no statement, no case... Mike, observe. You come all the way over to show me chili con carne dance? Mike, That's not chili con carne. That's the dog's brain! What's the difference. He's dead, right? The dog's dead. They're dead. But their brains are alive! I can re-animate Mitch's brain and get him to give any god damn statement you want. Really? Any statement? Well hell, let's go! we're wasting time, Let's go get a statement right now... Voila! Voila, what? Looks like my theory works... My God, what's going to happen to us Harry? Shut up, ok? I'm thinking. You, I should just shoot. End of story. It's you honey, I'm wondering about.
