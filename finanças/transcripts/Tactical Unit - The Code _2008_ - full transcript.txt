Leisure and Cultural Services Department sent this video to us. Actually, the use of this camera is to monitor... any littering in the alley. But it has recorded some policemen were beating a man. He is not a nice guy for sure. But it is clear that the suspect was under control at that time. According to the law, it can be labeled as an illegal assault and battery. The superior has decided to start the investigation. Although, this video has not spread out yet. But there is still the risk. The vice commissioner hoped that we can finish the investigation as soon as possible. So we can avoid all the troubles afterwards. The question is no one has reported on chasing suspects on that day. And the man has not yet met with Complaint Department... to complain about this incident. That means you are going to find that man who was beaten. And we are going to give you those colleagues. That's right. When we have found all the evidence, we'll see if anyone had got out of line. Where did it happen? It happened in the alley of... 36 Granville Road Tsim Sha Tsui. It's my West Kowloon area. What about the time then? It was 23th August, 2006 at two a.m.. Good afternoon Sir. Good afternoon. Chief Inspector Chan Chi Yan. Good afternoon Sir. Sit down. Thank you Sir. I am Chief Inspector Chan Chi Yan. I am the vice captain of PTU Bravo Com of West Kowloon. Chan Sir, are you in charge of... Granville Road Tsim Sha Tsui? Yes. According to the police general rule Chapter 29, if it is needed, we can use the least forces to achieve a mission. I am the Senior Inspector Wong Chung Ching. I am the 3rd platoon Captain of the PTU Bravo Com of West Kowloon. Wong Sir, on the evening of 23-8-06, isn't the 3rd platoon first column... in charge of ACP in Tsim Sha Tsui? Yes Sir. According to the tape, Can you recognize the three policemen in the scene? It is vague. I can't recognize them. Sergeant 7366. Night snack in old place. I am a sergeant. Serial number 7366 Lee Wing Sam. That night we had been patrol on Granville Road but we had not reached that alley. Then what do you think of how... we have this film? Two possibilities. Other colleagues walked into our territory. Or someone pretended to be police. I am Sergeant Cheung Pui Yee. Numbers 26316. That night We were doing ACP in Hart Avenue. In the meantime, we arrested a drunkard. From 1:30 to 3:00 a.m., we were detained in Tsim Sha Tsui police station to provide witness reports. File no. 06-35789112. At about 2:00 a.m., we were having our late supper. Where did you have supper? The rooftop of Ka Shing Building in Tsim Sha Tsui. Why did you have supper there? It is our habit. Usually when we are on the late-shift, we eat takeaway there. How long did you stay there? 30 minutes, then we continued our patrol. Day off. Yes Sir. On the evening of 23th of August, I got a T.O.. It's fine, thanks. Goodbye Sir. Tong Sir, your breakfast. Put it down. Four breakfast. Thanks. Did CAPO get enough evidence? I don't know. If there is anything I can help, just tell me. Okay, take your breakfast. Black coffee and fried egg sandwich. Where is Eight? Wong Sir had asked him to go upstairs. Sam, according to Shing... We heard that... CAPO is looking for that guy who got beaten up, named Shing. That asshole helps his Boss Bill for loan-shark. He did many nasty things if he couldn't get the money. I have been wanting to arrest him for so long. If you need any help, just call me. Okay, have breakfast now. Ham and egg macaroni, ice tea. Bro Tong, Cheung said someone called you... a few times just now. Did he leave his name? Shing. I got it. Eight, about your debt declaration, we will have the result when Chan Sir is back. Don't worry. It should be fine. I will call you afterwards. Thank you Sir. CAPO just contacted us. The investigation on the suspected beating cast is still in progress. You can still serve your duty at this moment. Other columns set out to patrol already. You will be in charge of Sai Yeung Choi Street Nathan road. There are many burglary cases recently, so more VBP is needed. Alleys and public toilets do needed stepping up patrols. Moreover, there is an extra operation today. This is our own service. We will not cooperate with other units. Our target is the entertainment venue in Sun Mong Building Jordan. It belongs to Bill. Recently, his men are getting really active. They fight around and be impolite to police. Go and check their license. Any Question. No Sir. Start off at ten minutes later. Once the investigation is completed, the colleagues involved will definitely be dismissed. CAPO is still looking for the evidence and they don't have much progress yet. But sooner or later, everybody knows even the one who shouldn't... It will be trouble. Be careful. Sam. Checking license is more time wasting. What if we divide our teams? We will do VBP and the alleys. We will meet afterwards. Thank you. No thanks. I hope that they can get it done soon. Why? Afraid to be involved? No, I just want to help. Don't worry. Bro Sam is going solve it. They will ask if they need. Finish the orders first. How is it, Chiu? Bro Tong. You seldom call. What is the matter? Isn't it someone complain me to CAPO? No, I need your help. Can you recognize him? He even doesn't have a face. Take a good look. This guy should be hanging around in your area. He is covered with silver hair. I don't get it. What did the bastard commit? I don't know either. But sooner or later some policemen will suffer because of him. Anyway, just get this guy for me, okay? I will do it for you of course. Give it to me. I will look out for you. Thanks, Bro Tong. No problem. I will call you. I have to go now. I will dine with my boss. Thank you. Can he help? I don't know. Just another clue. What's up, Boss? About the PTU beating case, CAPO asked me to find out the victim. I would even forget who I beat. He won't bother me. Your phone rang just now. Really? Yes. Call me back, Shing. Search from the attic? 4 Floor. Checking license. Turn on the light. Turn off the music. Dak, you help Eight. Who is the in charge? He hasn't come back. Call him back. Checking license. Wait here. Hey. Sit down! Sit down! Didn't see him. Get the manager here. Manager, this way. You deal with them. Just do it here? Your ID card. Where is Big B? He is coming. Where is the keeper? Where is the keeper? Bastard! You should tell me earlier! Go out, close the door. Did Shing come? He came a few days before. But He was lost these two days. Do you know where is him? I don't know. Or you don't want to say it? How can I say it if I really don't know? Roger so far. ID Julie 339477, the last digit is 5. Over. I need Shing. Sir, I really don't know. How can I get Shing? I don't know him well. How can I get him then?! Console calling PTU 5788. Console calling PTU 5788. Send. He is not wanted. Roger. Thanks console. How can I get Shing? No, Please don't, Sir. I really have no clue. Chuen. Big B. Our license holder. What's up, Sir? Eight, let Bro Sam do it. Brother. Stand still. What the hell are you doing in my place? I am looking for Shing. You don't have to do this. Keung, bring him to a doc. Stand still! Big B, I really need to know where is Shing. Help me. Leopard, I am Big B, where is Shing? Bill's men. Fine. He went to Macau. He will be back this afternoon. He lives in Rm 508 in Chan Ma Building. Got it? Thank you. Sir, have you finished your investigation? I have to do business here. Did you get anything? This bastard has two sticks of cannabis. Damn it. He got two sticks only. Are you taking care of him? Need a team to search it out for you? I don't know him. Go and arrest him. Did you call the car? Not yet. Are we going to sue him? Of course, call the car. Give the letter to Eight. We have to afresh the schedule. Tell the colleagues when debriefing. Chan Sir, don't you have any means? Can we talk about it with Captain? All is firmed. What can I do? I have read through Eight's report. He has great records. So what? He was willing to declare it. Since he thought that we police force could help him. He is too optimistic. If you are worrying that he can't take it, just refer him to the counselor. But" Give him the letter first. Maybe he can take it. We can't settle all by ourselves. How about the beating case? Did the three guys say anything? Right now we still can't proof that it was them. I don't care. What I need is get it done. Hey, is Big B's information for real? We'll find it out soon. As long as we get Shing earlier then CAPO. Sam, if we get Shing, should we force him to get away? We are policemen. If we find him, I have a means to shut his mouth. Is it done? It is done. He was released on bail. He is Big B's men though. Sam, I don't know what you have talked about with Big B. You know, I arrest those who commit crimes. Okay. Let's eat. Eight, Wong Sir want to see you. Thank you. What happened? I don't know. Maybe he wants to praise you. That's right. I haven't got enough quotas. If you have more good jobs like this, please let me. Let's eat. Don't make fun with me. Wong Sir, you want to see me? We have result already. What's wrong? The lock is broke. What is the noise? Who is it? Eight, what the hell are you doing? Handle it yourself. What are you doing? I want to know what had happened. The lock is broken, Sir! You seem can't control your own feelings! If you have any questions, you should talk to me directly. Dak, find someone to fix the door! Yes Sir. Give me a report afterwards. Yes Sir. Sam, wait a minute. Sorry, Sir! I apologize for what just happened. What do you want to say? Is it possible that you can ask the superior... ...not to put me to the civilian post? No. It's you who encouraged me to do the declaration. There's many thing I can't be in charge. I am not borrowing from loan sharks. Just one of the victims of negative equity. Why don't you help me? Nobody cares if your debt is reasonable or not. If I were failed in rescheduling debts, I would totally willing to. But you don't even give me a chance. If you think I can't help you, you could come to Chan Sir directly. You mean it's not your responsibility then. It's enough. It is only a temporary policy. Doesn't mean that the Welfare Department will not lend you money. My case has not reached the tribunal panel. But you had already put me out of the way. They will not lend me money, of course. As long as I can't meet my debts, you will dismiss me. I will not take the offer. This is a violation. I am not going to discuss with you now. Move to the car! Start off now! Talk to me afterwards. No need. Why did you hit him? He resisted arrest and get rid of the drugs. I didn't have any evidence against him. I know exactly what I am doing. Me too since I've joined the police force for so long. Everything I do, I follow the rules. I never hit a people. I never step any wrong steps. So what? I am shifted to another post. No one will find out I'm in debt as long as I keep it low. I can still work as a policeman. I can still carry a gun. But I was so stupid. I turned myself in. I thought that they would help me. I was so stupid. Uncle Tung. I need your help. Can you recognize this man? I don't know him. What about you? No. I haven't seen him before. And the picture is too vague. Try it. I can't see his face. May. Uncle Tung. Let's have a talk. Did you involve in the beating case? No. Now anti-triad operation of Yau Tsim Mong need to get one team to help CAPO looking for that bastard. Sam has got into trouble. Just stay out with this. I got it. Take care for yourself. I go now. What did you say? It is none of your business. I am here as your tour guide only. I don't have to report my private life. We've got his address. Maybe there's some clue. Move to the car. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Haven't come back yet. Let's move to the backstairs. What's wrong? Move. Sam, I will go upstairs. Dak, go with him. No need. Bro Sam, can Eight go alone? Leave him alone. We will get Shing's done first. Hey! Police! Stop running! Bro Sam! Stop running! Downstairs. Console PTU Bravo three 39622 over. A drug dealing was found in 5. We are hunting for the suspect. He is running towards Ferry Street. You can remain silent .. Unless you want to say... You bastard, hit me! Bring him to the car. Go! You saw he hit me! I need to go to hospital. Eight! Don't you know what're you doing? Wong Sir, the suspect resisted arrest and hit him. Then he could beat the suspect, huh? Go and return your gun! Return your gun immediately! I have been carrying my gun for 25 years. You have shifted my duty already. And you asked me to return my gun now. You can't serve with your gun today! Move to the car! You are just using your authority, Huh? If you don't see yourself as a policeman, I will put off your uniform and lead you away in handcuffs. Do you dare to try? Seven, bring him back with the suspect. Yes Sir. Move to the car. Let's go. What happened? We were going after another suspect. Where is the suspect then? He was lost. How about Eight? I will take care of it. Just concentrate on your job. Yes Sir. Here. Nobody. Cheng Sir. We couldn't get the bastard in Chan Ma Building. Man has just contacted with the broadcasting station. The PTU has been there too. That means our clue is right. Inform our colleagues to concentrate on... searching for Chan Kam Shing. I'll arrange another team to take care of the PTU. Roger. Just help me to get this guy. Are you sure? Yes. This is much easier. Stand still. Eight, I help you. You just take a rest. Stand still. Cheung Sir, PTU Bravo three, the first Column. Four colleagues just found a case of suspected drug dealing. In Chan Ma Building, Yau Ma Tei. PC 5788 ran after the suspect to the market. They got to the fish stall and the suspect resisted arrest. In the mean time, they both got wet. PC 5788 is taking a rest over there. This was left by the suspect. Go and see your colleague. Wing, bring the suspect to the search. Yes Sir. Eight, Eight. Is he okay? Need to check with a doc? He's fine, Sir. Put away your gun. Put away your gun. You return your gun first. I'll call you when Wong Sir is back. Crow. Bro Sam. Have a talk. Okay. How is Eight's situation now? Wong Sir will definitely put this on his file. Let's talk to him when we're off duty, Let's finish this first. That's all I know. Thank you. Not at all. I can't really help anyway. Get back to work now. How is the situation? Nothing. Look for another one. Bro Sam, I am Orderly. Eight seems a bit different. When we handed over the suspect in the DO room, He took his gun out and wiped it there. I talked to him and he ignored me. Also, Wong Sir asked me to rearrange the schedule roster. No need to put Eight's duty from tomorrow. I wonder if you could talk with him afterwards. I got it. Thank you. I am Eight. I am busy at the moment... There is a fight in Sing Bo Night Club. Address is Rm 4. We'll see. I don't care who he is. Now our bro was stabbed. Just to find that bastard out. What a favor. Here comes the revenge. Boss, we couldn't catch him. But I know him.

He ran along Nathan Road towards Yau Ma Tei. Out. Roger. Pay attention to... the wanted person described by EU colleagues. May, they are looking for the guy in Bro Sam's case. Let's move to Yau Ma Tei. The bastard should not appear in this situation. If he is found by others, there will be a big trouble. Did Wong Sir know that? If you see him, please take care of him. Thanks. What happened? Seven said that Eight has not returned the gun to Armory yet. Wong Sir does not know that. Switch off the engine and ID card, please. From CAPO. UI No.28967, Dak, check this too. Thank you. I'm sorry. Someone may pose as a police officer. Sorry to disturb you. It's okay. I'm afraid that I may disturb you for getting Chan Kam Shing. They are valid licenses. Over. Cheung Sir, I'm sorry. You may go now. You can go now if you are in a hurry. I have time. May, I'm Sam. Can you do me a favor? Just say it. CAPO is stalking us. I wonder if you could go for me. Where? Shing is getting really trouble now. He will run away at anytime. He may go to Bill. Also, Eight is in trouble. We'll go back to the base first. Okay. Sam just called. He wants us to get Shing for him. Let's go. Bro Bill. Where is that bastard? Upstairs. Bill. What's the matter, Tong? They want to talk to you. Bill, we are from Complaints Against Police Office. Where is your man Chan Kam Shing? What crime did he commit? He is in connection with one of our cases. I asked you what did he commit? This is none of your business. We only want to know where is he? This is ridiculous. You come for news and you don't even tell me what happened. Don't you think I would tell you the answer? Please cooperate with us. What would you do if I don't? You even haven't a gun. Don't be so cocky, okay? You only know how to fix the police. Is it okay, Tung? I'm fine. You can't get anything here. Let's move on. You've been troubled me for a whole day already. Are you going mad with drugs? Not only losing all the drugs, you also attacked Big B. That bastard betrayed me. How can I hang out there if I don't deal with him? Now the police and Big B's men are both looking for you. You can't hang out either. You even get CAPO looking for you. What the hell did you do? Nothing. Bastard, hide yourself. I will deal with Big B. Thanks, Boss. I'll call you afterwards, bastard. Police. Freeze. Put your hands over your head. Hello, Cheng Sir. We have followed those PTU back to the base. I think they will off duty soon. Should we continue to trail? They can't do anything at this moment. Look for Chan Kam Shing first. Roger. Move to Jordan. Yes Sir. Split off. Not in the briefing room. Restaurant either. They said they didn't see him. Let's continue. Sam... I arrested him at Bill's place. But I had reported to the station. Chung is showing him to the small room. But Serious Violence and Crime Unit will come in fifteen minutes. Bus Captain had told me Eight's case already. How is he now? We haven't found him yet. I will pay attention to that. Move to the small room first. Thank you. Move to the rooftop. Seven, Eight is temporality on holiday starting from tomorrow. Take off? Just follow what I said. Ask him to see me. I'll be back soon. Yes Sir. Suen, move to the east wing. Nothing. What should we do, Bro Sam? Let's inform our vice captain. We have to deal with Shing. Eight is wandering around with his gun. How can we ignore that? Look for Eight. Let's go. Chan Sir! With regard to Eight... About Eight's. Captain informed me already. It's surprise me that you convinced them to let him stay. Sorry Sir. It's alright. We need to be opened up. But you've seen how Eight behaved in the toilet today. How can I let him on duty with a gun? I'm going to let him taking day off from tomorrow. Afterwards you can talk with Captain in the meeting. Even if we can't change the decision of Eight's shifting, the Welfare Department might have approved his rescheduling already. The situation will be really different then. We had over a hundred policemen who were deeply in debt last year. They all need support. How many of them you can help? I will have a meeting in the headquarter. CAPO has checked the guy is called Shing. If it proofs that it was done by these three guy, I will definitely remove them. If we dealt with him first, all would be fine. Wong Sir. What's the matter? May has just arrested a guy. The suspect is sending to the Serious Violence and Crime Unit. Isn't it that wanted person Shing? Yes. We will off duty in thirty minutes. We can talk about it in the briefing room then. Yes Sir. Tong, I'm Sam. Shing has gone to your place. Can I talk to him for a few minutes? No problem. But he is not here yet. I'll call you then. How is that? Wait for Tong's call. Damn it! He said we can call him if we need help. We still have chances about the beating case. We'd better look for Eight first. We have to return the gun in thirty minutes. What if we inform the vice captain. We don't know if he is going to kill or suicide. If we were not chasing for Shing, Eight would not turn out like that. If we could find him return the gun, we could solve other problems. Tong, I'm Wong Chung Ching. Do me a favor. It's easy. Just let me meet that guy. I would do everything for Wong Sir. But my boss is here. I will deal with him first and call you later. Cheung, I have to see a doc. You take in charge. It's okay. Boss, where are you going? We take over this guy. Let's go. Chan Kam Shing, 43 years old, right? Isn't it? Yes. Where do you live? Mong Kok. Which part of Mong Kok? Rm D, 3. Boss, he is Shing. His name is Shing. He is in connection with the bodily harm of the Nightclub keeper, whose name is Big B. EU saw him on the crime scene but he ran away. Did you find any witness? No. Big B's men are not willing to say anything. We found the knife near the scene. Okay. Where do you work? Wing Lee financial company. You are a loan shark then. I'm a PR manager. Sir! I have to pee! Where have you been between 3:00-5:00 p.m.? At home. Sleeping. I have to pee! Don't fool around! No, Sir, I really want to pee. I'm Tong. I am busy at the moment... Wong Sir, we can't find Eight still. Where is he? I don't know. But he was strange. When we were in the DO room, he took his gun out and just wiped it there. Armory just said he hasn't returned the gun yet. May. It is done, right? I just brought Shing to the Serious Violence and Crime Unit. But Bro Sam didn't come to talk with him. They were going to the small room. How come they haven't talked? I don't know. I saw them when I returned the suspect. "Sam, I'm May. Why don't you look for Shing? We saw Eight at the rooftop when we're on the way. But we can't find him when we went up there. So we just split up and search now. I got it. If we find him, we'll call you. Thanks. May, have you seen Eight? No. Eight was shifted. This was supposed to be his last duty. I am not clear about his situation. We have to find him out. Let's split up our search. We'll see in the armory. Yes Sir. Bro Sam. We have to hand in our guns. We have got a case already. If we don't return the gun on time, things would get more trouble. We have done our part already. We even gave up Shing for him. If we don't return our gun, we would be another Eight. Why did you attack Big B? Dispute over places? Damn it! I don't even know who is Big B. You don't know? You are from the same industry. Why don't you ask Big B to recognize me? I need to crap. Just leave it. I'll let you go soon. Big B's men are waiting for you at the front door right now. Are you bluffing? What do you want? I need to crap. Do you have enough? I need to crap. What are you doing? Sit down! Bastard, you'll get into trouble if you can't make it. Go! If you don't sit down properly still, you'll be in big trouble. Go! Chiu, I am Cheng Sir. Man checked that Chan Kam Shing was wanted. And he was arrested in West Kowloon. Go and have a check. Roger. Chan Kam Shing is in West Kowloon. West Kowloon Office. Tong Please. He is not here. Who is it? I am Wu Wai Chiu Inspector of CAPO. Did you get a suspect Chan Kam Shing? Yes. He is related to one of our cases. Keep him there for us. We need his statement. How? He is related to a serious crime too. We have our job either. I can't make a decision. Can you come over and talk to my boss directly? Damn it! Move to West Kowloon! Sam, have you met Eight? No. He hasn't returned the gun and we couldn't find him. He didn't answer his phone. Wong Sir, nothing. Wong Sir had convinced the Captain changed his shifting... to off duty. He doesn't know this yet and he is still holding the gun. We worry that he would lose his mind. Five minutes left. If he doesn't return the gun on time, he would be wanted. Just wait a minute. Hope that he would come and move no more wrong steps. Stand still. Talk to me finally, huh! I thought you didn't recognize me. You didn't listen my call for a whole day. What do you want? Solve this for me. How can I? I am a policeman. The only thing does matter is the knife. Help me to wipe out the fingerprint. I will deal with Big B then. Just give him a few hundred thousands is fine. I'll find a lawyer to deal with it. I can't bear the risk to do it. You don't do this for me. Do this for your debt. You owe us nearly six hundred thousand. Where is the interest of this week then? I borrowed from your boss, not you. But I know! I might be in jail for two years. What if people found out you borrowed from loan sharks, you cannot be a cop anymore. Just think about it. West Kowloon. I got it. Damn it! Bothering me. Boss, I just got a called from the hospital... He said Big B has died. I got it. Hey, what are you doing? Big B has died from internal bleeding. Let go. You have committed murder. It is irreversible now. Seven, call him one more time. Yes Sir. I am Eight, I am busy at the moment... Nobody answer. Return your gun first. I am going to inform Chan Sir. Let go! Let go! He has taken my gun. Cordon base. Guard all the exits. CAPO Colleagues. What is happening? What happened? A suspect has taken the gun and run away. The base is cordon now. Nobody can get in. Cheng Sir, West Kowloon has lost a suspect. We can't get in. Everybody knows. Also, there's a report from headquarter said the suspect is Chan Kam Shing. Wait there. Call me if there is news. Roger. Listen, there is one suspect who got away. He fired one shot. Wearing a black shirt, blue jeans. And covered with Grey long hair. He is carrying a gun. The gun was taken from the sergeant. It has approximately 5 bullets left. The ground floor is all cordoned. We may divide into four sweeping teams. Fai. Sir. Responsible for the No.3 ladder of the barrack. Yes Sir. Chiu. Sir. Responsible for the No.4 ladder of the barrack. Yes Sir. Sam. Sir. Responsible for the No.1 ladder of the main building. Yes Sir. May. Sir. We are in charge of staircase No.2 of the main building. Yes Sir. Hoi. Sir. Arrange four colleagues to do the observation at the top. Others will move to the car park. Yes Sir. If Eight is still in the base, we may find him by chances. I have seen him just now. He comes for me. Try to appease him if you see him. If there is a risk, you may shoot. Yes Sir. Any Question? No Sir. Be careful. Go! Go! Go! Sam, what should we do if we meet Shing? If he is not pointing his gun at you, Are you still going to have a chat with him? Bro Sam. Stop. Stop. What's wrong, Sam? Eight is at the rooftop. Bring your men upstairs to check with it. Be careful. We haven't got Shing yet. Yes, Sir. Suen and Dak go to rooftop with me. Jack, you keep doing the sweeping. Yes, Sir. Eight, there is an escaped suspect inside the base. Are you still trying to hide? If you don't come out, I will deal with you like an offender. You think you are right. You want to fix Wong Sir. In fact, he has convinced the Captain already. You don't have to shift anymore. He has solved all the problems for you. Why can't you wait a bit more. Things are getting worse now. Are you gonna push yourself to the dead end. Bro Sam, it is Shing! Police! Come out! Come out! What's wrong, Sam? What's wrong? Sam, answer me. Shing is in the rooftop. He is shooting at us. Sergeant, bring your men to the rooftop and guard Exit B. I am going to guard Exit A with my column. The rest guard on the ground floor. Upstairs! Shing. You are not going anywhere. Put down your gun and surrender now! Sam, at you 12:00 position. Seven, stay at this exit. Go! Sam, we are at Exit A of the rooftop, where are you? Eight. Eight is chasing Shing towards East Wing. We are at your 3:00 position. Sam, surround him. Sam... Sam... Sam... Put down your gun. Put down your gun. Don't come any closer. Run away! I will kill him! Run away! Run! I'll kill him! Run! Eight. Eight. How are you? Command post 38166 over. Send. Command post, two ambulances please. 5788 and the suspect got shot at the roof top. The scene is under control now. Commander Wong Sir is here too. Over. Command post, ambulances were arranged already. How is the situation, Over? Our colleague has got a shot. He still has breath and heartbeat. The suspect has got four gunshots. No vital signs. Over. Command post, ask one of the colleagues to call back. Over. Eight, wake up now. Eight, Eight, look at me. PTU Sergeant... I was patrolling with PC 39622 in Tsim Sha Tsui on that day. At about 15:30, When we went through Carnarvon Road and Hanoi Road, we saw the defendant beating the victim. I stopped them with my partner. The defendant tried to flee. We succeed to stop the defendant in the pedestrian which is opposite to... 42 Carnarvon Road. I saw the mouth of the victim was bleeding. After investigation, we've found that this was done by the defendant. Do you get used to it? No. But it is much better than typing in front of a computer. It is difficult to predict. That shot supposed to be fired at either. Wong Sir or myself. But at last it was fired at the criminal. And what I did is legal. The most important thing is... you have stopped me getting wrong. As long as you are okay now. Wong Sir helped me wholeheartedly. He didn't tell anyone about I wanted to kill him. He knew that you had lost your mind at that time. But I had really done that. After serving five years civilian post, I can pay back all the debts to the Welfare Department. But I wonder if I have the confident to pick up my gun then. I can't face myself. Just leave it to that. Don't bother about the early retirement. You said you always know... what you are doing. How about your beating case? Shing is dead. CAPO has closed the file. Hey, my son has graduated. He is a Probationary Inspector now. He will service into West Kowloon. If he becomes my boss, ask him to take care of me. Of course. So that you'll never beat any suspects again. Stand still. Don't try to fix me with false evidence. I'm going to sue you. Shut up. We can see those faces clearly. It is the three men from Bravo Three. Maybe you can use a vacuum cleaner to collect them. Go away, bastard. I can run many times. Why don't you chase hawkers since you are such a runner. He is so bluffing. How did you get the movie? A bar girl recorded this in the alley with her mobile phone. She planned to put it on web. But her boyfriend took it to us. Her boyfriend is my colleague. Is he trying to make a issue? He didn't hand it to the CAPO so he might just want to help. What for? We should remove them from office. Wong, Although they have gone across the line, we have to consider the pressure of our frontline forces. If you were the one who got insult like that on the street, You would even shut down Yau Tsim Mong for a whole week. You handle this then. CAPO has closed the file already. What if we give them a chance? I suggest that we delete this video, does everyone agree? Do what is needed in the right time. I will check on you whenever I see you. I don't think that... ...you can get away next time.
