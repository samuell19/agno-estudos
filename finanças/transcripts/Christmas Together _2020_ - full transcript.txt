Well, thanks to me, now you have a little extra change in your pockets for the next few weeks. Mia, we got very lucky, and you also did a wonderful job cleaning up the guesthouse. Thank you. But doing something like this behind my back is unacceptable. And what on earth made you do such a thing? Well, you said getting a dog was a big responsibility and there were costs, so I figured if I could show you that I was responsible and industrious by taking care of our guests, bringing in a little extra money, you might come around. You have a one-track mind, you know that? I know where you get that from. - Sorry, Dad. - It’s okay, sweetheart. I just don’t want you to be dishonest. Misleading people is the same as a lie.

I’d love to. What is it? Haven’t really done a school project since I was in school. You’ll do great. Hey, only three more to go, and we’ve completed the scavenger hunt. Good job. Oh, that’s my friend, Missy. I’m gonna go tell her you’re helping with the school project. - Got it. - Mia? I’m going to hang out with Missy for a little bit, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Olsen’s world famous cocoa. I hope it doesn’t disappoint. That’d be a first, in Tinsel anyway. Mm! [coughs] It’s really hot, but it’s very delicious. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Oh, of course. She’s, um, such a sweetie. Yeah, she is. Guess that’s because of you. You two seem like good friends. She’s my daughter. I don’t suppose you have any-- Oh, no, just nieces and nephews. Just never really thought about it. Yeah. I mean, that’s actually not true. I never really thought about it... until now. What, until now? Yeah, just seeing you guys like a family. It’s really sweet. Sorry. I told you way too much. I just have a lot in my mind right now. Do you have... A boyfriend? Yeah. It’s complicated. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to pry. No, no, you’re not. It’s just... We’re on a break. He got busy with work, got a promotion, while I’m just... just trying to figure things out. Oh. Specifically where I wanna be. Is that all? [laughs] Do you always keep a notebook and pencil? Not always. Sometimes I type in my phone. Why? Ideas come into my head. I wanna write them down and-- Huh. What? I never realized that I do that. I’m just surprised anyone else did. Well, as a matter of fact, I... do the exact same thing. No way. I have an idea, I have to write it down. Wow. This is amazing. Did you just do this? I did it in New York.

Yeah, well, I could take a couple down if we got a real one. - Hmm. - You have to admit things are going pretty well with Ava. Is this your Christmas presentation? Yeah. It’s not quite right yet. Still have to work on the speech. Well, write from your heart. But now that Ava is helping me with the official part, at least that should be okay. - You lucked out. - Yeah, well, I wouldn’t say I’m the only one. What are you talking about? Don’t you like her? She’s very nice, yeah. Oh, come on. You know what I mean. I’m not sure if I do. Don’t you like her? Like her, like her? I saw the way you looked at her tonight. Dad, it’s okay. I miss Mom very much. And I know you do too, but... I don’t think she’d want you to be alone. I’m not alone, sweetheart. I got you, don’t I? It’s not the same thing. Plus, I don’t plan on sticking around here forever. - Huh? - I’m going to college. I’m taking a gap year, probably in Vienna. Oh, you’re are, are you? Dad, Ava’s great.

AVA: Why do you ask? MIA: I’ve never been. I hear mixed things. Oh, you do now, do you? Is it nice? Oh, I wouldn’t say it’s nice. You definitely have more room to spread your wings here. Sometimes I feel like I’m living in something about that size. Those are beautiful. Yeah, but without the beautiful. But you’re right. They are beautiful. Such artistry, huh? Mr. McMurphy makes all his toys by hand. People think he spends time in the North Pole and here. Yeah, I wouldn’t doubt that Santa sets up shop here too. It is a nice place to set up a shop, don’t you think? Yeah, it’s perfect. Little art gallery? Is that what you want for Christmas? [sighs] That’d be nice. But sometimes I’m just a little nervous to make a big leap like that. My dad says sometimes nervous is just excitement you don’t recognize. Your dad said that? He’s a neat guy, isn’t he? Yeah. What do you want for Christmas, Mia? [sighs] - You okay? - He’s gone. - Who’s gone? - I had my heart set on the most beautiful little dog, Prancer. Dad said to give him more time, and now he’s gone. Well, you don’t know that. Maybe he’s just-- What? There’s always Santa Claus, right? You’re a really nice lady, Ava. Well, thank you. Do you ever think about sticking around? Here, you mean? Yeah. Well, between me and you, I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. - I’d like that. - You would? Not as much as a puppy, but... Okay. I’ll talk to your dad about a dog, okay? You’d do that? Well, I can’t make any promises, but I’ll try. [school bell ringing] Hi. Hey. Thank you so much for coming today, Ava. Of course. Sorry. I feel a little awkward, since I’m not a parent or guardian, but-- Oh, that’s nonsense. Nonsense! When I saw this display, I just had to meet you and thank you for such a beautiful piece and for helping Mia. Of course. You’re very sweet. I’m so glad you could come today, parents and special friends. Before we dismiss for Christmas break, our student of the month, Mia Miles, is going to give us a very special presentation. That is very cool. [Mia clears throat] What’s Christmas all about? Some people say it’s about Santa and presents and puppies. Other people say it’s about family and friends and helping other people and a little baby in the manger. To me, it’s all those things. But when I think about how it all started with a tiny, little star in the sky... But it only looked tiny. It was huge. But it was far away. As far away as it was, it was still bigger and brighter than any other star in the sky. And people from all over followed it. They wanted to know what it was. Angels, shepherds, poor people, wise men, all just looking for something that was missing in their lives. And they were hoping that that light would lead them to something better and something good. And when they found it, they were all so happy. All these different people from all over following something bright, something that looks small, but ended up to change their world forever when they spent that first Christmas together. And ever since then, even when we are miles apart or... even departed, that Christmas spirit lives in us all, all year long. That’s what we celebrate, being together on Christmas. She is an amazing little girl, you know. I know. You know she wants a puppy. I know that too. It’s hard to say no to that. You must have some resolve. Yeah. That was wonderful, Mia. Thank you. - That was so good. - Good job! Great job. DEB: Okay, so a little bit of red. There you go. Perfect. Do you think my dad realizes how wonderful she is? Oh, I don’t see how he can miss it. Though that boyfriend of hers is a bit of a wrinkle. You know, back in the day when I was a chef, there was a rumor going around that once you tried my recipes, you’d fall in love. I don’t like to think I’m that out of practice. She’s right, you know. I walked into her restaurant with some clients, and I walked out of that restaurant having to know who created this wonderful dish. I can’t believe I was able to lasso her. Hearts around the world broke when I married this fine woman. - And bellies wept. - That’s right. You know, I have been dying to try out this Christmas tenderloin recipe. Mm, that sounds good. Let me know if you need anybody for a taste test. This time, I think I wanna try out some different taste buds. But you can help me out with another diversion. - You know where to find me. - I sure do. Give me some sugar. Come here. Well, what do you say, Mia? I’m all for it. What do you need from me? Well... ♪♪♪ I think "jerk" might be the best word for how I act. Do you think you can forgive me? I don’t know. To be fair, it sounds like this break has done you good. I mean, I can’t believe you went on a scavenger hunt. I didn’t know you even liked that kind of thing. Well, neither did I. You know, I went on a scavenger hunt once in camp. What was the name of that place? Minnetonka? Waynoka? Williwonka? Ava? Ava, you still there? Yeah, yeah, I’m still here. I thought I lost you. I didn’t lose you, did I? Of course not. That’s crazy talk. Hey, when we get back to New York, maybe we can both go on a little scavenger hunt of our own around the city. [sighs] What? I don’t know, okay? I thought you said you liked it. I just don’t know if I wanna live in New York anymore. I mean, I thought getting out of the city, it would recharge me and make me excited to go back. But the longer I’m gone, the more I don’t wanna be there. What are you saying? I don’t wanna live there anymore. What, you wanna move to Christmasburg? It’s Tinsel. Tinsel. I know where you are. Ava, are you okay? I don’t know. Look, I just-- I know I don’t wanna live in New York anymore. Look, I’ve got one more day here, and then I’m going back to the city. I know you’re really enjoying yourself, but I’d really love to see you. When you get back to New York with me, I think you’re gonna feel differently. You take your time, but let’s talk when you get back and figure this out. I love you. [sighs] ♪♪♪ - Morning. - Morning. - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Is this your shop? - It’s my building. I’m hoping to rent it soon. I’d love to see an antique shop or craft store or art gallery. - Art gallery? - Something like that. I was thinking the exact same thing. Oh, are you interested in taking a closer look? Yeah, but I’m curious. The rent? Well, I’d initially need a thousand dollars. It’s only a thousand dollars a month? Oh, no, that’s just the security deposit, credit check, the first month’s rent. Monthly rent is just 405. I might be able to work with you if that’s too much. 385? Would you like to take a closer look? - Yeah. - Come on. - What’s up? - I’m doing good. Just reminiscing about the good ol’ days. And Ava? Ava, yeah. Kelly... You know, I didn’t get to meet your wife, but from what you tell me about her, I think she’d be happy for you. Man, I think she is happy for you. You guys were high school sweethearts, right? Sophomores, yeah. Most people were partying in college. You were starting a family. [laughs] You know you’re allowed to have fun, right? Yeah. So be happy. I mean, you of all people know that there’s bad things in life, but there’s a lot of good things too. Why’d you get into astronomy anyway? Why do you ask? I just wanna know. It was you. When I got the job at the college and came out here looking at houses, you went on and on and on about the observatory. Christmas year-round, observatory, great place to raise a kid. I always thought the sky looked beautiful at night. And after Kelly, I really liked the idea of different worlds, different dimensions. You know, far away. I don’t know. The stars made me feel safe. I know things have been rough for you, buddy, but lately it seems like your head is staying in the stars, and you’re missing a lot that’s going on down here. You could use some help. I mean, as much as Debbie pitches in, Mia needs more, you know? Yeah. And I’m not talking about a replacement, and I’m not just talking about helping Mia. I’m talking about someone to help you too. And I’m sorry, buddy, but I’m married now, and I can’t do it anymore. Ava does have a boyfriend. How much does that change how you feel? Not much, no. Well, keep working on the friendship then - because that’s what lasts. - Yeah. If something more comes from it, it’ll work itself out. But this right here is a good thing, Mason. So don’t let a good thing pass you by down here, while your head is a billion miles away. [knocking] - Hi. Good morning. - Good morning, Ava. - Would you like some coffee? - No, I’m fine. Oh, okay, well, have a seat. Ooh, looks like you’re having an inspiring morning. [sighs] Very. Any plans for dinner tonight? I was planning on trying out the Holiday Hideaway. Oh, don’t wanna do that. I don’t? Such a dive. Oh, well, the flyer said it’s Tinsel’s best nightspot. Can’t believe everything you read. I was wondering... do you wanna do dinner with us tonight? Oh, you and Charles? And Dr. Miles. Dr. Miles. I have this wonderful little Christmas recipe I’ve been dying to try out. A new dish from the legendary New York chef? Is that a yes? Absolutely. I’d be honored. Great. 7:00? - Sure. - Good. Oh, and feel free to stop by early for cocktails. - I’ll be there. - Bye. Bye. ♪♪♪ What’s this? It’s a tie, Dad. You look nice in a tie. Thank you, Mia, but it’s just dinner, not a banquet. Deb’s trying out her new Christmas tenderloin recipe. I know. That’s why I jumped at the chance to try it out. Sorry I can’t come. Missy’s been wanting me to come over for so long. I feel like I owe it to her. I’m sure Deb will understand that a busy woman like you has other social engagements. Oh, I’m sure she will too. I don’t see why a tie is necessary. It streamlines you. Are you up to something? There’s not gonna be a puppy waiting for me over there, is there? No, I can promise there won’t be a dog waiting for you. All right. - Don’t you look spiffy. - Thank you. Come on, come on. Ahem. Ava. Dr. Miles. Charles, are you okay? Oh, yeah. I twisted my knee a little. That’s all. Dinner’s almost ready. Won’t you all have a seat? After you. [whispering] [phone buzzing] Oh, I’m so sorry. I have to take this. Hello, Bill. Everything all right? Don’t they look wonderful together? Oh, yes. Okay, so let’s go. Oh, no, but I haven’t eaten yet. - Charles! - I mean, it’s dinner. Bill, are you sure this can’t wait a little longer? I’ve already got our plates ready to go to the office. Come on. Stick to the plan. Okay, okay, I’ll be down. Is everything okay? [sighs] Oh, it’s Bill. Bill? Bill from the office. Just a little end-of-the-season business. I just need to get back down there. - What, now? - Right now. Okay. Mmm! Smells delicious. For you and you. I need to get back down to the office. Oh, honey, is everything okay? Everything’s great. I just-- You know, my knee, I need to get back down there. I really need a ride. I can give you a ride, if you want. Oh, nonsense. No, I am already up. You two are our guests. - Enjoy. I’ll take him. - Thanks, babe. Now, dessert is in the fridge. Bon appétit. AVA: Must be nice to have a world-class chef right next door. I am very fortunate. She’s a good neighbor. She says the same about you. You two have gotten close while you’ve been here, haven’t you? She’s a neat lady. You’re a neat lady. What I mean is you seem like you’ve got a pretty interesting life. - I do? - A New York artist? Don’t people dream of having a life like that? I guess you’re right. Sometimes the things you dream about don’t always add up to the way life really is though. - Yeah? - The way you want it. Not that it’s bad. It’s just... I don’t know. It’s not the way I thought it would be. What’d you think it’d be? Honestly? Something like this. I grew up in a small town really similar and... I don’t know. It’s just not there anymore. Huh. What? It’s just that I grew up in a town like this one. It’s not really there anymore. - The business shut down and... - Everyone moved away? Yeah. I mean, I can’t blame them. I did it too. I know exactly what you mean. Guess that’s why I like this place so much. It’s why I do. Well, not the only reason. [door closes] We’re back. Oh! Thank you so much. - Did you enjoy dinner? - Yes. Dinner was amazing. Couldn’t agree more. I mean, um... What isn’t absolutely amazing? Well, you two must be starving. Actually, I’m pretty full. - Time for bed. - Yeah. Your knee seems to be better. Comes and goes. - I should get going. - Okay. Yeah, me too. It was lovely. Thank you. You’re welcome, darlings. Thanks again! Something tells me that Charles’ knee is fine, and you didn’t have any business at the office. I just thought you two needed some time alone. How’d it go? Good night, Deb. And, Deb? Yes? Thank you. You’re welcome. Yes! AVA: Dinner was so great. Well... Well, good night. Good night. Wow. It’s a really starry night. I wonder. What? What’s that? That one is Cassiopeia and Cepheus. Who? Let me show you. So Cassiopeia was very beautiful, but also extremely vain. And one day she insisted that she was more beautiful than the Zeus’ wife, Hera, which led to Hera tying her up and sending her off into the stars. When King Cepheus, Cassiopeia’s husband, found out about this, he was heartbroken. So rather than be without her, he begged Zeus to be sent off into the stars, so that he could be with his wife. And that bright light that you see? That’s the two of them clinging together... forever. Wow. It’s beautiful. It’s also a little sad. Yeah, I guess it is. MIA: Dad, there’s someone here to see you. [knocking] Can I help you? Yeah, I was looking for-- - Dean? - Ava? Dean, what are you doing? Packing. That’s my suitcase. Mm-hmm. How did you get here so fast? [scoffs] Hey, it’s good to see you too. No, that’s not what I meant. I just-- I thought you were going to New York. Change of plans. What? After I got off the phone with you, the CEO met with me. This apparently wasn’t just a retreat. It was an interview. And it wasn’t just a promotion. They want me to run the entire Denver office. They tripled my salary. - Denver. - Yeah! They’re transferring me out of the city. Out of the city? Don’t you see? We both get what we want. I get my dream job, and you get out of the city. Well, what do you say? I figured why not swing by, pick you up, and we’ll spend Christmas in our new home together and check it out. This is happening way too fast. Merry Christmas. - Where are you going? - I need to go for a walk. What am I gonna do with you? Don’t worry yourself too much. But I do worry about you, Mason. I saw the way she looks at you. More importantly, I saw the way you looked at her. I have no idea what you’re talking about. Oh, for the first time in years, you got a little twinkle in your eye, a little pep in your step. Did you notice that her boyfriend surprised her from out of town? Kinda figured that’s who that fellow was. You know, if I didn’t like you so much, I’d be concerned about all the spying you do on me. Whatever. Have you kissed her? - What? - Simple question. Well, I was about to, and then her boyfriend barged in. You do care about her though, right? We just met. That’s not what I asked you, Mason. Taking chances is like the best part of being alive. And if you don’t show her how you really feel, you’re gonna spend the rest of your life wondering, "What if?" Why is this so important to you? Because you’re my friend, and you’re a wonderful father. And I wanna see you happy. But you have to have the courage to want it too. I also think you look more handsome when you’re happy too. [chuckles] Good night, Mason. Good night. DEAN: Ava! Hey, what is wrong? I figured you’d be thrilled. You’re right, okay? I do need a change from the city. Well, then let’s go to Denver. You didn’t even ask. What are you talking about? Of course you’re invited. You can’t just make executive decisions about my life. - Ava... - No. Dean, I know that we both want different things now. If your boss asked you to move to Timbuktu, you would, which is something that I love about you. But I need to know that you have the same love for me, and you don’t. I love you, but...

Sweetheart, I’m sorry, but I couldn’t very well keep him quiet under the tree all night, now, could I? Mia. Merry Christmas! Say hi. Thank you for keeping him for the night. - Of course. He’s an angel. - [barking] See there? I told you your dad was the best. [laughing] Took him long enough. I’ll say. How did you keep him a secret? After you and I went to the kennel, I spoke with them and told them I wanted the puppy and to just hold him until Christmas when I pick him up. Simple. You made me sweat this whole time. We should straighten up. Your grandparents will be here soon. I can’t wait to introduce them to Prancer. Ava, you’re gonna love them. Mom and Dad usually stay in the guest room, but I was thinking this year they’d stay in the guesthouse. Then where will I stay? I’m sure we can figure something out. I’m sure we can. Merry Christmas.
