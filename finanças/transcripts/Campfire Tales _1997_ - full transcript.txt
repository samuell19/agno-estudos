Cliff: ohh, we don't need no highway. We take the back ways, man. This is the scenic route. Would you get your boyfriend in line? Just chill out. Enjoy the ride. I shouldn't have come. Whoo hoo! Ha ha ha! Man, this is the best car, man! [Tires squeal] alex: well, would you drive like a decent human being? [Laughter] lauren: [laughing] cliff, watch it. Cliff: watch. Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo hoo hoo! Alex: knock it off. Lauren: it's not funny, cliff. Cliff: aw, come on, lauren, lighten up. Come here. Cut it out and watch the road. Not in front of my brother. You guys are gross. Me? I'm not doing anything. Alex: would you get on the right side of the road? Cliff: come on, man! Nobody else out here. It's just us. Lauren: cliff! Cliff, watch it! [Horn honks, tires screech] are you sure you're ok? Yeah, i said i'm fine. Ok. Oh, man. I'm sorry, you guys. Oh, baby, i'm so sorry. I know. I know. Oh, god, you're bleeding. Need a hand? Fuck off. Well, obviously she's feeling ok. Thank god we didn't hit that car. They came out of nowhere. They came out of nowhere? You were the one that was all over the road. [Sighs] oh, my god. I can't believe this. Oh, my god, my brother's gonna kill me, man. Listen, i'm really worried about eric. He looks really shaken up. Hey. You ok? Yeah. Huh? Want to help me start these flares? Ok. All right. They didn't even stop. Probably thought we were crazy. Uhh. Let's just start walking. Where? You can start walking, ok? I can't leave my brother's car here. If you had just stayed on the highway like i said, we wouldn't be here freezing our asses off in the middle of nowhere. Cliff: why do you have to be such a pain in the ass? Alex: why do you have to be such an idiot? Cliff: fuck you. Lauren: oh, god. Would you guys please stop it? Please? Eric, where are you going? Eric: you guys, come look at this. Give me the flashlight. Eric: oh, my god. Lauren: looks like it must have been a church. Alex: god, this place is creepy. It's just a building, alex. Wow, this looks like early 19th century. I'd say... 1837. How can you tell? Well, it says it right there. See, it's not that bad, man, you know. We're all ok, you know? We saw a great concert. Right? It was pretty awesome. There you go, buddy. You wear that t-shirt tomorrow to school, you're gonna be the man. Guys, maybe we should go back up to the road. That way, if a car comes, then they can call for help. Yeah, right before they kill us. We're ok. If a car comes, they're gonna stop at the flares. We'll hear 'em. You want to build a fire? Cliff: nice. Ohh. Don't burn the article about the concert. What's the matter? Holy shit. What? 2 people were hacked to death around here. Yeah, right. Let me see that for a second. Oh, this is sick. What? "Police speculate that the murder weapon "was an ice pick or possibly even a meat hook." They say they have a suspect, but they haven't made an arrest yet. It's pretty freaky shit. Ohh. Hey, you ok, eric? What? Yeah. You're lookin' a little scared over there. [Rubbing hands together] no. I'm not scared at all. Well, uh... i think that's just 'cause... you know, you're with me right now. If you were alone, i mean, you'd be shitting in your pants. I mean, you'd be... seeing and hearing things that weren't even here, you know? You'd feel like you were being watched. Every sound would... seem louder than it really was, you know? Dee! You are such an asshole. You're not gonna scare us. Really? You know, if i did want to scare you, i'd tell you about rick and valerie. Cliff. Eric: you'd tell her about who? He's asking. Yeah, tell me. Come on, tell me. I'm not scared. Go ahead. All right. [Clears throat] rick and valerie were these newlyweds from long island. They decided to honeymoon, road-tripping to vegas. They were gonna stop along the way and see all the sights. So they rented this big ass rv, and they were off. Rick: [with radio] ♪ i have kissed ♪ ♪ your lips ♪ ♪ a thousand times ♪ ♪ and more times than i can count ♪ ♪ i have called you mine ♪ ♪ you have stood by me ♪ ♪ in my darkest hour ♪ ♪ and, oh, how happy ♪ ♪ you have made me ♪ ♪ oh, how happy ♪ ♪ you have made me ♪ come on, everybody. Both: ♪ oh, how happy ♪ ♪ you have made me ♪ ♪ oh... ♪ ♪ oh, how happy you have made me ♪ ooh. I think this is where we turn off. Oh, i'm turned off already. Do we have to go? Valerie. History took place here. You know, we could never be back this way again. Promise? Uhh, now, that pains me. Rick: you know, that's not a positive way to start a marriage. Besides, i want you to look me in the eye, and i want you to tell me that you have absolutely no desire to see clayton's caverns. Which eye? Ha ha ha ha. Smart ass. Either one. I have absolutely no desire to see clayton's caverns. Whoo. You know something? I want you to read page 62. I've read it already. I want you to look at page 62. I read it already. For me? 1922, 12 pioneers got trapped in the pass, and only 3 survived by eating the other 9. Right. See? Valerie, it's second only to the donner party trail. Oh, ricky ricks! What?! Well, it's dark outside already. Besides, i don't know what you think we're gonna see out there. Dead bodies strewn along the rocks? Well, what would you rather do? Mm-mm-mm. Oh, you devil. I don't know. Oh, you are a bad girl. You are so bad. I'm gonna punish you, bad girl. Oh! Ok. Valerie: promise? [Giggles] [valerie laughing] mmm. Maybe next time we'll make it to the bed. Mmm. I hope 20 years from now, we'll still be knocking it out on the floor. 20 years from now? I hope we're knocking it out anywhere. I think there's somebody out there. Here. Put this on. [Bangs] aah, shit. You all right? I just twisted my ankle. Rick: stay here. Can i help you? Honey, wait inside. No. We have money. I ain't after your money. [Bird squawking] [wings flapping] that's just a crow. Crows don't squawk at night... unless they're stirred. [Twittering] you know where the highway's at? Yeah. I go straight ahead, i get to the lake, and i make a left. No, no. You make a right. You'll hit the highway in about 4 miles. Thank you. And don't stop for anything till you get to the highway. Now go... and pray they don't get you first. Who doesn't get us? Valerie. When the moon's full... they come out to hunt. Now, you listen, boy. A while back, my wife's car broke down out here. We never found her. Sorry. Yeah. They must have heard my truck comin'. You're lucky you still got your skin on. What do you mean? There's tracks circling all around your vehicle. Now, i wasn't the only one here. Now go. All right, come on, baby, let's go. And no matter what, y'all stay inside. If they stop ya, you lock your doors and wait for sunup. Ain't nobody ever seen them in the day. I guess we better--we better get moving along, then. Thank you. [Engine starts] how bizarre was that? [Laughs] "when the moon is full, they come out to hunt." Thought that was the wolfman. He seemed so... concerned. Valerie, he's a peeping tom. All right? Who knows how long he was out there jangling his keys? What about all those footprints? The guy made 'em. What about his wife disappearing? If i were that guy's wife, i would disappear, too, right? [Engine knocking] oh, man, what now? Rick: aw, shit! Valerie: what? It can't be empty. I just filled it up. Well, maybe there's a leak. Rick, he said to stay in here no matter what. Give me a break. [Twig snaps] [wings flapping] [hooting] [snarling] oh, easy, cole. Easy. Easy. [Rustling] i'll take you with me! "The lord is my shepherd, i shall not want; "he maketh me lie down in green pastures. "He restoreth my soul. "He leadeth me in paths of righteousness "for his name's sake. "Yea, though i walk through the valley "of the shadow of death, "i will fear no evil; for thou art with me." [Chittering] rick: god damn it! That son of a bitch siphoned our tank. What? No more. [Snarling] hear me? [Breathing] [snarling] [ripping] aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

Come here, sit down. Let me see that. Valerie, that's really swollen. No, it's ok, ricky. Rick: there's got to be a first-aid kit in here somewhere. Jesus. I could catch a fuckin' marlin, but god forbid we cut ourselves. Screw it. I'm gonna go to that store by the turnoff. I saw a pump out front. But, rick-- honey, i'm gonna fill up the can, i'm gonna get you to a doctor. They got to be closed by now. So i knock on the door. I'm sure there's some hick sleeping in the back. What if that guy's still out there? Valerie... that guy is long gone by now. I'm not gonna let you lie here uncomfortable all night... especially on your honeymoon. I'm gonna be back in an hour, and then we're gonna get out of here. All right? Ok? Ok, honey. Hurry. I will. Don't worry. Look, uh... if it makes you feel any better, you can lock the door after i leave, all right? And we'll have a secret code, ok? You don't open it until you hear me go like this... [knocks 3 times] ok?

Rick! Rick! [Faint scraping] [3 knocks on door] man: hello? Is anyone in there? This is deputy munson from the sheriff's department. Are they gone? Yes, ma'am. You alone in there? Yes. Are you injured, miss? I think i'm ok. Can you stand up and come to the door? Can you step down, please? Good. Oh, my husband just went to get gas. He should be back any minute. Ma'am, we're gonna walk to my car now. Oh, no. I have to wait for my husband. Why don't you come with me to the car? And we can sort everything out at the sheriff's station. Please, let's just keep moving. [Scraping] w-wait. Just--please. Keep your eyes straight ahead. Keep walking to the car. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Cliff: she screamed so loud that she drowned out the sound of her husband's wedding ring scraping across the roof. [Imitating scraping] ugh. Well, i know one thing-- i'm not driving to las vegas on my honeymoon. I don't think you have to worry about a honeymoon. That story's not true, though, right? Nah, it is, man. I know a couple of guys that lived in the town it happened. [Lauren laughing] what's so funny? I just remembered something. Ha ha! What? Do you remember when dad went to las vegas, and i had that really bad nosebleed? No. You were like, i don't know, 5 or 6, and it was really late. You were sleeping, and i was laying in mom's bed, and she just didn't know what to do. She tried everything, and nothing worked, so she called grandma, and i guess we must have woken you up, because you were standing in the doorway when the blood just started pouring out of my nose. [Cliff laughs] this is funny to you? Wait, wait, wait, wait. So when mom saw it, she dropped the phone and just fell backwards. She fainted. And then you went over to the phone, and you said, "grandma, mom's dead, and lauren's bleeding to death in bed." And then you just hung up the phone. [Owl hooting] [animal groans] [sobs] hey. Hey... it's all right, lauren. Hey, it's ok, lauren. We're gonna be all right. It'll be like, um... another funny story. [Laughs] [rustling] [noise] what the hell was that? What? Cliff, would you please not do this? Oh, you're not scared, are you, cliffy? You guys didn't hear that? You think the flares are still burning? Yeah. We stacked them, so they should burn for, like, uh... a half hour. Eric: oh, man. Fuck. Aw, shit. I forgot to feed dante. Don't worry about it. I filled his bowl before we left. He's fine. Really. Yeah, he's safe and sound at home. Hey, that reminds me of another story. You guys want to hear it? How about you, sweet cheeks? All right, this is about a girl, a little girl. Amanda. It was the day before her 12th birthday. She couldn't wait to get home. Katherine: i don't care if you were joking. No, you embarrassed me in front of my friends. Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you pissed me off. Dad! Dad: in the kitchen. [Panting] did you get it? Your birthday's tomorrow. Oh, can't i please have my bike tonight? Bike. That would have been a good idea. Dad. [Odin barking] hey, odin. Come here, boy. Is mom home yet? Not yet. Come here. Oh, what a good puppy. Oh, come here, boy. Uhh, uhh, yeah, uhh. Listen, thanks for sticking around with amanda, katherine. You didn't wear that to school, did you? I did today. [Door opens] there she is. Sorry i'm late. Hi. Hi, girls. Mom, did dad buy my bike?

Better hurry. Ok. Oh, you guys hungry? What do you guys want to order? Uh, daddy, why don't you just leave me the money? And i can order us something. Mm-hmm. Here. Here. Oh, i don't think this is gonna be enough, especially if we order chinese. You're like a sieve, katherine. Here's another 10. Here's your split. I'm going out tonight. Don't tell anybody, ok?

Wait. How about this weekend just you and me do something together? No guys? No guys. Ok. And about cliff? I really wish you would just give him a chance. You should see how sweet and sensitive he can be. So, you got hair on your balls yet? What? [Laughs] you're so immature. I guess that means no. Fuck you.
