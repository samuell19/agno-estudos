TOHO CO., LTD. (Momoji Sandayuu, Iga Jounin*) [*"Jounin" = Highest ranking ninja] (Shimoyama Kai, Iga Jounin) Wabi-Sabi Subs Presents: SHINOBI NO KUNI "Mumon: The Land of Stealth" Come on, bring it! What's going on! (Shimoyama Heibee, Shimoyama Family's Heir Apparent) Oh! Big Brother! (Shimoyama Heibee, Shimoyama Family's Heir Apparent) It's a fight... with Momoji! Did something happen between us and the Momoji House? I dunno! This is stupid. Is this another one of your petty skirmishes? - Father! - Load the ball! Shoot those arrows! Hey Boss. Maybe we should retreat this once... The gate will open any moment now. What is that? Damn smoke. (Mumon = it means "Nobody"; literally, "No gate") There's no such thing as a closed gate for that guy. (Mumon = it means "Nobody"; literally, "No gate") That's why he's called "Mumon". (Mumon = it means "Nobody"; literally, "No gate") The gate has opened. Attack! Go! That's it. Surround me. Make sure to protect me. Well, that's it for me. You're just here to open the gate again? Yeah, if I get in a sword fight, I might get killed. Kill Shimoyama Heibee's kid brother, Jirobee. I'll pay you 30 pieces of eirakusen (copper currency). 40. 50. 100! Very well. Let me borrow for a while. Incredible. Big Brother! Aren't you going to fight? If we combine both our powers, we could annihilate all these guys from the Momoji House. Jirobee! The enemy has parents and children, too. One shouldn't kill without thought! - Mumon! - It's Mumon! Go! Don't toy with me. Kaaaawa! It's the "Kawa"! ("Kawa" - one on one fight to the death within a small space between two drawn lines) - "Kawa" time! - Kawa! ("Kawa" = one on one fight to the death within a small space between two drawn lines) Is he crazy! Kawa, huh. What a drag. Stop it! You mustn't fight! You're no match for him! What? Oww oww oww! Damn you! What is that! Hey! Come on! Go get him! Here we go. Don't do it, Jirobee! Well, what do you know. You're Jirobee, huh. ("Kawa" = it means "river") Jiro... Jirobee... Jirobee!! Brother... Well... That's it for me. You bastard, Mumon! You're... fast, huh. You son of a bitch... What are you mad about? Hey! Shimoyama! Sandayuu! The signal for the Council of 12 Houses Assembly has sounded. Let's call off the fight! How about it. Do you want to go to Heirakuji (shrine) together? How long are you going to keep this up? Father! Jirobee got killed. So what about it. He was your son! A second son is nothing less than a genin (lowest-rank ninja). Why are you upset about a genin getting killed? This is where I was raised, the country of Shinobi. Petty skirmishes have always occurred here for the longest time. Countless people get killed. Men who thought nothing of people. They're not humans. They were beasts like tigers and wolves. (A Tribe of Savage Beasts*) [*"Yakara" = has the characters of "tiger" and "wolf"] Other countries called them "The Tribe of Savage Beasts". (A Tribe of Savage Beasts*) [*"Yakara" = has the characters of "tiger" and "wolf"] Why am I... ...with these crazy fools? I have now fully realized it... These people... ...are not human. (Iga Province) However... it is also a matter of time before this country of Shinobi is destroyed. (Iga Country) (Owari Country) The supreme ruler during these turbulent times, Oda Nobunaga... (Owari Country) ...has put all the countries surrounding Iga under his control. (Owari Country) ...has put all the countries surrounding Iga under his control. At present, his evil clutches have reached towards the neighboring country of Ise. (Ise Country) Nobunaga has forced his power midway into Ise Country... ...by having his own second son Nobukatsu, be adopted by way of marriage into Ise's ruling family, the Kitabatake. (Kitabatake Nobukatsu, Oda Nobunaga's second son) Pardon me. (Kitabatake Tomonori, Ruler of Ise Country) You're late... my dear son-in-law. (Kitabatake Tomonori, Ruler of Ise Country) From the time you came to my house... ...I knew this day would come. However... Daizen... Sakyounosuke... [Former Kitabatake Vassals: Heki Daizen, Nagano Sakyounosuke] Competent warriors who defied Oda when you were on my side... [Former Kitabatake Vassals: Heki Daizen, Nagano Sakyounosuke] I did not expect you have the gall to show your faces in my presence. For the meantime, where is the "Little Aubergine"? Wait, what are you talking about? Stop feigning ignorance. A thing that is said to be worth as much as building a castle... ...the tea container worth 10,000 kan (silver currency). If you hand it over willingly, I'll make sure nothing unfortunate will happen to you. I wonder if you're referring to this? Well. You have a good heart after all. You scoundrel... What's wrong? Come, let's get this over with. Wait! Daizen! What are you waiting for, Daizen. Didn't you hear my order? I will do it! Show your skills, Sakyounosuke! Aye! Daizen! Aren't you going to assist Sakyounosuke!? Can one kill his former lord!? Sakyounosuke! Stay still! Daizen!! Daizen, listen well... From now on... Ise will be under Oda's reign... If you're going to serve as vassals under them... ...bear in mind the peace and welfare of the people of Ise. This time, you will be with the Oda Clan. My lord... My lord!! No... Not my father too! Please stop! What do think you're doing to your husband!? I NEVER thought of you as my husband!! N-Neither did I! Prepare to die! Your Grace! Move away, Daizen! (Heirakuji, Mt. Ueno, Iga Country) If Ise comes under Oda's rule... Soon, our country will likely follow suit. (Council of 12 Iga Jounin Houses) - Uzura. - Yes. Who killed Kitabatake Tomonori? I believe it was "Daizen". What? If it's Daizen... that's the former vassal of Tomonori, wasn't it? Among his vassals, he was considered THE protege of proteges. Then, what shall we do? I didn't expect they'll come invading this soon. Right, Shimoyama? Yeah. If they're planning to guard against us, they'll need to build a castle fort, right? A castle fort? In our territory? For sure, Nobunaga will resort to such means. If they ever do build a castle here, we are finished. We must convey to Oda's men... That we do not have even the slightest intention to go against Nobunaga. Hey, Mumon. If we're going to war with Oda... ...who's going to pay us? Yeah. Military commanders of other countries hire us for our skills (as assassins and spies). With that money, we're barely able to survive. But who's going to pay us, if we fight for this Iga? The Council of 12 Houses has made a decision. If we fight against Oda, our country will be destroyed. We of Iga... ...will surrender to Oda. In line with this, we'll assign someone to send our message to Ise. Shimoyama Heibee. Bunzo of Momoji Clan, you will accompany him. Aye! Depart immediately. Convey our intention to Oda Nobukatsu. If we surrender to Oda, who's going to pay us? Wouldn't it be Oda? I'm home! Welcome back. Uh, here... A hundred mon. So, I'm wondering... ...that maybe it's time you'll let me back in my house? Mumon-dono. Yes? I do not accept this. When you took me away from my country of Aki... ...do you remember what you said? You are already under my spell. You shall not speak. Just continue to listen to my voice and... Are you a Shinobi? Huh? I was fairly certain you're a Shinobi. A Shinobi from Iga too. Since you said I will no longer worry about money for the rest of my life... ...I agreed to run away with you to Iga as husband and wife. That's what you said, wasn't it? Well, it was something like that but... You DID say that, didn't you? Yes, I did. Instead, what is this? It's money. 100 mon of eirakusen. For this whole year, how much money have you earned all in all? Well, if you include this 100 mon... - That would total to one kan and 300 mon, right? - It's one kan and 386 mon! As a requirement for a married couple... ...how much would one need to live well together? I think in a year, you'll need around 40 kan. What you bring home isn't at all enough, is it? It's off by a wide margin, right? Having that kind of manner, do you honestly want us to live together as husband and wife? I do. Of course I do. All you do is shinobi work... if you come to think of it... ...it's just equal to being a peasant in Iga, isn't it? In the first place... ...what's up with that strange name of "Mumon". What do you mean when you said you can't tell me your real name!? Mumon-dono! Huh? You're back early. Welcome back. "He... Eh... Be... Eh... Ha.. D.. At... Tak... Mi". ("Heibee had attacked me") Boss... ("Heibee had attacked me") Shimoyama Heibee betrayed us. That boy... ...hated Iga that much, huh. "Attack Iga"? A person from Iga is saying we should attack his own country? My lord... This person might have been instructed by the Council of 12 Houses. We will clearly fall into their trap if we hastily attack Iga. But when it comes to the honesty of an Iga soldier... At the most... ...they number from three to four thousand. That number isn't even half of our troops! Have you forgotten... My father's words. "Iga may be a tribe of savage beasts... ...but they treasure their country fervently. ...We cannot invade it so easily." Attacking Iga is out of the question! Pardon me but... ...is that what your Lordship truly feels? You... what are you trying to say! You may continue. I am certain... "Nobukatsu-sama can invade Iga with his own power"... ...is what your father actually meant for you to hear. Are you... trying to trick his Lordship! My lord, you shouldn't listen to this Iga person! Well, it's true... That when your father Nobunaga was young, he did things to suit his own convenience. As an enemy that doesn't know anything about warfare, 3000 men is just some unruly mob... ...compared to our powerful troop of 10,000 soldiers. It's as easy as snatching sweets from a baby's hand. My lord, let us have our troops bring down Iga. It's a good opportunity to mow down Iga in one go, now that they're not unified under one ruler. I want to see his Lordship's bravery in battle... You are a bunch of laughs, each one of you! Do not underestimate the Shinobi. There's no military merit you can gain in eliminating them. An act such as fighting the weak... ...is something I, Heki Daizen refuses to do! I have decided. We will attack Iga! I knew we'll do it! Then... I propose that you keep a watchful eye on Iga, by building a castle fort within their territory. And I just have... ...the perfect idea on how you can do it. As to where they can build that castle... It's right here, right in the middle of Iga. The people of Iga will not permit it but... Building Oda's castle on our land is preposterous! Indeed, it's not an offer even worth drinking to. No no. It's not a matter of building an Oda castle. If esteemed council members such as yourselves want a befitting place to seclude yourselves... ...this Heirakuji (shrine) is indeed too cramp for you. How about your own castle with stone walls and surrounded by a moat? Such a thing can happen (with this). If you wish, it can have features like inner and outer citadels, and a fortress too. It can also have an oguchi*, or even an alternate entrance. (*Having one gate entrance/exit) You can build it any way you wish. Furthermore, in exchange for gaining rights to your land... His Lordship Oda Nobukatsu would like to welcome you as the Oda Clan's vassal state. Well, that is what we wanted in the beginning. Right? We had no desire to go against you. We are accepting Oda Nobukatsu's proposal to become a vassal state. That is what this Council has decided. With that, as a symbol of peace between our two countries... ...we will build a castle fort on Maruyama. What? What about our fields? What the hell? I won't do it even if you pay me. Furthermore... ...the Oda Clan will pay those who will participate in the construction. Your wage for each day of work... ...is a hundred... ...and fifty mon!! I'll do it! For each day? That much for each day! 150 mon for each day of work! Work hard, everyone! All right~! I can't believe how stupid they are. Shimoyama Heibee said it, right? "Throw them some money and they'll treat you like a master." They're not much different from a scoundrel. What? ♫ Ah, I hate it, I hate this ♫ I hate sawing work ♫ Even cows get to sleep, dammi~t No resting! Do you know how much you're being paid!? What is this... What did you just... I told you not to do such a thing. We could lose our jobs. Oh, right. Hey, what are you doing. Don't just go stealing that. What's going on there! - Hey! - Oh, right. - Name? - It's Dengo! - Dengo? - Yes. Here's 150 mon. Next! - Name? - Risuke! 150 mon. Next! Name? - Mumon. - 150 mon. Here's today's allowance. Thank you for your hard work. The Oda Clan is extremely powerful, aren't they? Well, since they're about to take over all the countries... ...they have to have lots of money. With today's allowance, you have 44 kan left to go. But... Building the castle will come to an end too someday, right? If it's over, then you know... my allowance will also be... Next! I'm ready. Please stop! Hey, you almost hit her! Oh, is that you, Mumon? Sorry, I didn't see you there. Nezumi, get out of the way! Next! Nezumi-san, what's your name? It's just "Nezumi". Since he's a runt. That's a nickname! That's not what I'm asking, I'm asking what his real name is... What's the meaning of this! It's a poisoned dart. - Poison? If he doesn't spit it out right away... - Yep, he'll die... ...if he's not trained. Don't touch me! The weak ones will die... That's the way it is. You were like that too... Well, not really. Because you know, I'm Iga's best shinobi. I've been the best since I was a kid, so that kind of training was nothing to me. Mumon-dono... Yes? Please become a samurai. I heard that a certain Hashiba, who served the Oda Clan as a sandal bearer foot soldier... ...is now a feudal lord of a domain, and has his own castle. (She's talking about Toyotomi Hideyoshi) If you truly are Iga's best shinobi... ...such a thing as being samurai would in no way be a difficult thing for you. Well, no thanks. I'm fine with the way things are right now. Continue doing occasional shinobi work... ...and living a carefree life like this with you each day is a small amount of blessing... I'll do it. I'll be a samurai, after all... Okuni-dono! It won't open. The heck... Thank you for your long and hard work. Lord Nobukatsu is also impressed with the work that people of Iga have done. What are you saying... It was because of Ise people's diligent instructions. No... It may not be much but here is a congratulatory gift from Lord Nobukatsu. Starting tomorrow, enjoy your deserved rest from the hard work you did with the castle. We will now take over the care of this castle fort. Very well then, thank you very much. Hurry, hurry. Guard the gate! Don't ever let an Iga shinobi come inside. Well then... burn it. - Burn it!? - Burn!? You already got paid, right? We have no use for that castle anymore. Look! Dono! Dono! What are you doing! Stand up! Open the gate! Open the gate! Run away! Everyone, get out! Release! Shoot your arrows! Shoot at them! Release! Shoot! Shinshiro-dono... This after all... was a plan to make us fall into your trap, wasn't it! I never meant... for this to happen! We shall attack Iga immediately! Sandayuu! What were you thinking! Those Oda men won't keep quiet about the burning of the castle. They will surely attack us now! Oda's army is around 10,000! They greatly outnumber us, don't they! Shimoyama, you were in this, too. Your son even betrayed us from the start... What are you up to, by starting a war... What's so funny about this! Sandayuu... Could it be that you... ...pulled off a jutsu (trick / technique)? I will not go! What! I don't care even if it was a trap. They got paid to build a castle. After they got paid, they burned it. That's all there was to it. What use is there in fighting such fools? Heiki-dono... Daizen, wait. Wait Daizen! What are you thinking! Now that the Maruyama Castle got burned... ...the young Lord will lose face all the more if we don't attack Iga. - Why should I care! - Daizen. You know it too. There won't be solidarity among us. If you don't fight in the war, many of the Ise men will follow your example and won't fight either. If so, Iga will... Listen to me, Sakyounosuke! Even if Kitabatake didn't do anything, he was destroyed nonetheless. Us, killing him like that... ...is equal to making fun of a person on the verge of death. I will never resort to any act that resembles bullying the weak... ...ever again! Did you think... ...I was fine with killing our former lord!? But these are troubled times. Those with power are leading the way to bring peace and unity to all the lands. Will you work for them or against them? You can't have both ways! Nevertheless... I still won't follow orders to destroy them. Listen up, all you men of Iga! The day has come that the Oda army will attack this Iga. Therefore... We will defend the key points along our border with Ise, and attack the enemy! I have a question. What is it? If we're going to fight, I'm wondering who's going to pay us. That's right! We don't get paid if there's a war. Somebody ought to pay us for risking our lives for such work! - Yeah! - That's right! You fools! You still talk of money even at a time like this!? Have you forgotten our law! When another country attacks... All men of Iga should sincerely defend their country with their hearts. If one refuses to follow this law, his entire family will be killed as way of punishment! All of you, return to your villages immediately, and prepare for battle! Even though we won't get paid...? You'll fight in a war where you could wind up dead? And you won't get anything from it at all? That's why... Why don't we... ...run away from here? Run? To where? - Maybe to Kyoto... - How will you make a living in the capital? Well, maybe I'll perform acrobatics, there's a bit of money there... You mean you will beg. No, not really... You know I hate your Shinobi job... ...and now you're saying you're going to be a beggar this time? I don't remember discarding my country to be with a beggar! Yes, you're right. I absolutely hate the idea... ...of running away to another country! Fine. We'll stay here! All right? War with those Oda guys... ...I wonder how I can stop it? Hey there. Are you the Nobukatsu brat? How old are you? 21? You look young for that age. You haven't seen enough of life. Tonight you will end it, forget invading Iga. If you won't forget, this Mumon-sama will return to remind you again. Did you get that? Oda's brat. I am not a brat! I'm Nobukatsu! - It didn't work! - My lord! You people are a tribe of savage beasts. I, Nobukatsu, will annihilate you all! Whether it be a man, woman, or child, we will cut all your heads off! And put them on display, you can be sure of that! Women and children too? That's right! Even Okuni's head? Okuni? Who the hell's that? Don't try that shit on me. If you do, your head is mine. I will personally take your head in the battlefield. Not only will I trample your name on the ground... I'll send you down to hell as well. Hey... my lord, what happened? My lord! What is this... a jail room? Mumon! Oh, it's the turncoat! Why did they lock you up? Who's there? - You... did you come to kill me? - Why would I do that? Then, why are you here? "...it does not differ in the slightest amount." "If there is no causality, and it is void of reason..." (Reciting the writings of Buddhist priest Dougen) "Buddha will never come to this world..." "Bodhidharma..." Who are you! Beware of him, your Grace! That person is a disgusting shinobi who kills, too. What is a shinobi doing here? Perhaps to assassinate Nobukatsu-sama but I'm sure he was hired to do it. No, I didn't come to kill though. Kill Nobukatsu? I heard an Iga shinobi will offer his services for money. In line with that, I want you to do something for me. The enemy of my father Kitabatake Tomonori... Oda Nobukatsu... I want you to kill him! For how much? Bring it out. But your Grace! Do it! Kitabatake's treasured tea container... Nicknamed, the Little Aubergine. What that Nobukatsu saw was a cheap imitation. It seems he wasn't able to tell the difference but... This thing costs 10,000 kan. 10,000... kan... Your Grace! Don't do it. That bastard is a just a robber from the tribe of savage beasts... He won't keep his promise right from the start... Fine, it's a deal then. Mumon, you bastard! I am pleased. I have sent out my request. Lord Buddha has heed my prayers. There is no doubt Buddha sent this man to me. Even if I am powerless, I was finally able to do what must be done. I no longer... ...have any regrets. Mumon... What, you've been grumbling for a while now. You don't care about protecting anyone, right? You are not human. Why? A scoundrel like you wouldn't understand. She made a request on which she staked her own life. In this world, there are things... ...that are more important than money. I definitely don't understand that. - Was it a shinobi? - Yes. He went inside the lord's bedroom. Shut up! Be quiet! I'm ordering all of you to dispatch your troops! Gather for war at once, and invade Iga! Daizen! Why did you come! Are you here to laugh at me! Are you insane? Daizen! You listen well. Even if you do not help us... I, Nobukatsu will utterly destroy Iga! What did you say? What? What you said just now... Say it again. I said, even without you, I will attack Iga! Sakyounosuke... What will happen if I do not fight? I told you, many of Ise men will follow you... I bear some news! The shinobi was spotted at the outer citadel! What! Was he captured? My Lord! Please calm down! Let me go! Let me go! You useless people! - Go look for him! - My lord! I want to hear why you came to Ise. - Yes. - What's going on, Daizen. Tell me, what happened in Iga. My kid brother... ...was killed. It was just a skirmish with a fellow shinobi clan... They toyed with my brother... But no one... grieved over his death. The people of Iga are not human. Such men should not live in this world. That is why... I will bring Oda Nobukatsu's army and attack Iga. I want to rid this world of those inhuman bastards! Heibee. You got tricked by the Council's jutsu. That skirmish that happened... Don't you think it was a trick so you would betray them? Are you saying they tricked me? They made use of you because your character is unlike an Iga person. Look... why did you propose to us the building of the castle? If they're planning to guard against us... ...they'll need to build a castle fort, right? If they ever do build a castle here, we are finished. That was what you heard... And they made you hear it. Then it was a plan to have us make them build the castle? Yes. And they intended to burn it right from the start. What on earth for? To lure us in. Why are we luring in Oda's army? We don't have a chance against them! Otohano, haven't you noticed that job requests for our genins have greatly decreased lately? Well, so far, those employers (from the other countries) have been destroyed by Oda one after another. If this continues, Iga will be ruined. But what if... we win against Oda... There's no way we can win! Yes, we can! The man who has a problem with the coming war will not come to fight. That would be me! Daizen is that sort of guy. Having been forced to take part in killing his former lord, he holds a grudge against Nobukatsu. If that man is told to lead the troops against Iga, there's no doubt he'll refuse! It's true that if Daizen won't fight... His men won't fight either, cutting the size of their troops into half. If so, Iga will win for sure! And if we win against Oda... Iga's military prowess will spread throughout the lands... which means... Therefore, all the daimyo who are against Oda, will be left alone.. - Which means? - The hiring of our genin will increase! And if they increase? We'll earn profits! And that's what it's about! Pardon me! I, Heiki Daizen... ...will follow your order to attack Iga. Why now, after refusing all this time! Without me, you will lose. If so, those people will continue to rile things up. This was the trick pulled by Iga's Council of 12 Houses. You just do what pleases you... You look highly on yourself, and says whatever you want! Even without you, I'll attack Iga! That goes for the rest of you as well! If you're not truly willing to follow me, don't join me in the war! I will invade Iga with just my troops! - Heiki-dono! - Wait, Heki-dono! Do not misunderstand it, boy! Of course, all of the people here are being subservient to you only because of your father. I will join you in attacking Iga... not because I'm doing it for you... I'm doing it for myself!! So you admit it, huh! So what if I did! All of you... ...have no idea how it feels! Ever since I was born, I was told to be better than anyone... Not to lose to anybody. Not even to warriors like you who are envied! Do you have any idea how that feels like! All of you do not like me... I know that much. But... ...do you know how it is to have the world's top warlord as a father! No matter what I do, I can't match him. Do you all know how it feels like to have such a father! I was wrong. Daizen. Sakyounosuke. It was wrong of me to make you kill Kitabatake Tomonori. Forgive me. My lord! Regarding your father's wish not to invade Iga... I am sure what his message really meant was... "Show me you can invade Iga with your power." Therefore, all of us your senior vassals... ...will join you in the war! Everyone... ...gather your troops... ...and converge at the bottom of the castle immediately! Okuni, let's run away! Coward. Mumon-dono, don't you have any pride? Pride? To protect your country where you were born and raised. That too is a person's splendid pride. Yeah but... there's no money in it. I might get killed too... By the way... I just met Oda's brat a while ago... You're lying. No, it's true. It's just what I suspected... ...he said he won't let women and children live either. Women and children too? He'll cut off our heads and display it. Women and children too. Okuni-dono! I got hired for a task! Kitabatake-dono's "Little Aubergine". It's worth 10,000 kan. 10,000 kan...? With this, we can set up our own business. Let's get married in the capital! From here, we will split into three groups! My group will invade through the opening in Iseji in the south! Buzen'nokami-dono's troops will attack, passing through Bano in the west. His lord's troops will lead the attack passing through the opening of Awa in the north. It was the seventh month in the ninth year of the Tenshou Era (1579). Without his father Nobunaga's permission, Oda Nobukatsu set out with his troops... ...to invade Iga. Their number was around 10,000. Meanwhile, in the targeted country of Iga... (Awa Opening) (Awa Opening) So Heiki Daizen wasn't among the troops, right? Aye. Listen up! When the enemy passes through here... ...they will march by this road under the cliff... If so... ...keep them confined in that barrier over there... ...and from the top of the cliff, make it rain arrows on them! Victory is ours! (Bano Opening) All of you, listen up! (Bano Opening) Be the soil! The trees! The rocks! Make them realize thoroughly the terrifying techniques of the shinobi! (Iseji Opening) Nagano Sakyounosuke is headed this way huh... (Iseji Opening) We got ourselves an easy win. Listen up, boys! The one's coming here is Nagano Sakyounosuke's group! You don't have the slightest thing to be afraid of! It'll be a clean kill with one sweep of the sword! Aye. What the hell was that! You don't sound enthusiastic! One more time! Aye. You guys! Show yourselves! So few! What the hell is going on!! Why is there only a few? Mumon... Where's Mumon!! (Otogi Mountain Pass going to Kyoto) THIS many people are running away!? (Otogi Mountain Pass going to Kyoto) Yeah. Maybe half the people of Iga. - Half? - Yep. Iga will lose as soon as it fights. Get ready! Position yourselves! Get in your places! They came from there!? (Awa Opening) What's... with those many guns! Fire! Get down! Get down! All of ya! Bring back those who ran away! - It's not too late now! - There's still time! They're early! He's a huge guy! Sakyounosuke is said to be a small man but... That's... - That's Daizen's crest, isn't it! - It's Daizen! - It's Daizen! - That isn't Sakyounosuke! That ain't Sakyounosuke! Pardon me if I'm not Sakyounosuke! I am indeed Daizen! All you men of Iga... ...your heads are mine. Prepare to die! We're going to lose in this war. (Iseji Opening, Sakyounosuke's Crest changed to Daizen's crest) (Bano Opening, Buzen'nokami's crest changed to Sakyounosuke's crest) As expected, the enemy is indeed what I told you about. I see. Everyone, get down from your horses. Why did they stop? Stab! Aye! No way! What's the matter? I just remembered that boy... Who? Nezumi-dono. I wonder if he was able to run away with his parents just like those children? He doesn't have parents. He was bought from another country when he was a baby. Well, the brat's not skilled enough to escape by himself... So I guess now... He'll be fighting in the war...? Yeah... Poor kid... A small child like him is made to fight... and yet you...! I have changed my mind about running away. I will join in the fight too! Huh, wait! Wai- wait a moment! All right! We'll go! We're going! To where? - To the capital city. - Mumon-dono! I'm kidding. To Iga. Iga... Do you plan on going alone? Well, that's... Here is 10,000 kan! It's Kitabatake's "Little Aubergine"! I will give a reward to those who will join the battle from here! For every ordinary soldier's head, you get 10 mon. For each head of a ranking officer, you get 10 kan. Ten kan!? For Nobukatsu's head... ...you get 5,000 kan! 5,000 kan! All right, I'm in! Are you going? I'm going to fight! Look look, they're going to fight. Spread the word to all the genin! To assemble at once at the battlefield! Show them the shinobi techniques you acquired through many years of training! Now is the time to get big money! Wait for me at Heirakuji. Mumon-dono! Be careful. Make sure you won't die. This is it. It has come! What is it? I am... Iga's best shinobi. There's no way I'm going to die! Me! Count me in! Hey! What are you waiting for! It's big money! That 5,000 kan is mine! 5,000 kan!! Wait for me. Kill! Kill them all! As always, scrambling to be the first one to escape huh! No one's following you except for a scant number of soldiers... ...since you never cared for anybody but yourself. This is the just punishment you deserve! I can see that the water in Ise... has ruined your hearing. What? That sound that you can't hear means... ...that you are no longer a shinobi. Soldier's head, 10 mon... Officer's head, 10 kan... Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan... Is this what you call... ...a scant number of soldiers!? Officer's head, 10 kan... Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan... Hey there, sorry for making you wait. Mumon! All you men of Iga, hear me out! For every ordinary soldier's head, you get 10 mon! An officer's head is 10 kan. For Nobukatsu's head, it's 5000 kan! A soldier's head for 10 mon? An officer's head, 10 kan! Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan... Soldier's head, 10 mon... You scoundrels! Stop fooling around! Soldier's head, 10 mon... Officer's head, 10 kan... Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan! First to get 10 kan for an officer's head... ...is me, Mumon-sama!! Let's go!! The shinobi has started to fight huh! Get out of the way! 5000 kan!! I got ten kan! It's ten kan! Pull me up! Pull me up! Don't leave me! Protect me! Mumon! Mumon, protect me. Where's the 5000 kan? Nobukatsu's not here. He's at the Awa Opening. Oh, I'm in the wrong place then! Heiki Daizen's over at the Iseji Opening. What? Daizen? He came to fight!? Huh!? Mumon! Where did you go? Protect me! So you're the leader here, huh! Father! Heibee! Father! Father! Come on! Heibee! Heibee! Heibee, save me! Everything I did was for you! I wanted to leave you most of my lands, even if it's an "ittan" (10th of an hectare)... I did it for you!! Heibee, save your father! I no longer have a father. Yeah, that's right! Sakyounosuke's the name! Don't you forget it. Where are ya! 5000 kan! It's him... Mumon! Where are ya, Oda's brat! My name is Nobukatsu!! It's the 5,000 kan! You have to escape! Our young lord... will surpass his father!! I just can't run away! Hey there! Mumon! 5000 kan! Shit! You're Daizen-something, ain't ya? What's with your damn arrow. So you're Mumon, huh. Come. I'm coming even if you don't call me. You broke it. You... Being able to move with that means... Since I've never removed this in the battlefield... ...you wonder how fast I can move, right? Even I don't know it. Surround him! Aye! Die! My lord! That hurts... Get down, Daizen! Soldier's head, 10 mon... Officer's head, 10 kan... Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan... My lord... You have to leave now. Get away. Soldier's head, 10 mon... Officer's head, 10 kan... Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan... Let me through! Let me through! All of... Ise's troops... ...have retreated! What about Mumon-dono? Do you know what happened to Mumon-dono? Mumon? He's dead. I was such a fool. If you're a fool... ...I was a fool too. Sakyounosuke! You're alive! Yeah! Those guys... ...won't forget my name... I will throw open the castle for all the soldiers. Tell everyone to devote their time in recuperating. Well done. You! You're alive, huh. And he's not alone. You got that right. Mumon. This war... ...was all planned by the Council of 12 Houses. When you killed my brother... ...it was the Council's way to lure in Ise's military troops. It was a plan to crush them. Mumon. You and I... ...were puppets whose strings were pulled by the Council. So what. Even if you heard it... ...it doesn't matter to you at all, huh. It's the Kawa. Kawa... Kawa... It's the Kawa. Kawa! Kawa~! Even if you kill me... ...don't touch Nobukatsu and the Ise men. Yeah, fine. Whatever. Mumon! I said fine. Please. Shall we start? I... ...will die... ...as a human. I understand. Don't... ...be mad anymore. Daizen. What? Won't you... ...bury this man in Ise land? We will do so. Poor guy. Nobukatsu! Your head... Keep it for me, will you? Take care of it. Mumon... What does this mean, Mumon... What about the 5000 kan... Yeah! You got a problem? No... Wai-... It's Mumon! Mumon has returned! It's Mumon!! So you're alive huh! Mumon! Well done! Where's the Little Aubergine? We heard about it! You have it, right? Nope. What's that "aubergine" you're talking about? I heard no such thing. Oh, c'mon, Mr. Lowly Genin... Why are ya playin' dumb? What do you think you're doing!? For the sake of your greed... ...you manipulated us all this time, huh. What are you complaining about? You were influenced by greed too, weren't you! In the end, you and we are the same after all. We're incapable of living in the outside world. Since we're a Tribe of Savage Beasts! Fine, you got me right there... What you said is true... But... Somehow, what I don't get... ...is why I'm so fucking pissed off right now! Do you intend to make an enemy out of the entire country of Iga!? If I hadn't thought about it, would I be FUCKING DOING THIS!? Listen, all of you! The one who gets to kill Mumon... ...will be exempted from paying land tax for the rest of his life! This is the consensus of the Council of 12 Houses! A Tribe of Savage Beasts, huh. Step away from him! Is that... ...the Little Aubergine? Don't... If you lay even one finger on Mumon-dono... I will smash this into tiny pieces at once! Now do as I say! No... everyone... Don't do it! Is there more? Is there more!? I will save you... I promise I'll save you! - Mumon-dono... - Don't speak! Your name... Tell me... ...your real name. I don't know. When I was very young... I was bought and came to Iga. I didn't know what my name was. I don't have... ...such a thing as a given name. You poor thing. You poor poor thing... Of course, she's dead. She's not like you who trained to drank in poison, right? That's a dirty move, Dengo! I am... ...such a fool. You people... ...are not human. (Two Years Later) After winning against the Oda Clan, Iga's military fame astonished the world. Once, we wondered what we should do... ...to increase the hirings of our genin, right? Not only did it increase... They're in great demand. Iga will be rich from now on! Oda Nobunaga along with his son Nobukatsu as supreme commander... ...invaded Iga with approximately 44,000 soldiers, five times more than the previous number. Most of the people of Iga were annihilated. The country was turned into a land of scorched earth. They're already gone huh? The shinobi of this country. No. I think not. You can't fully erase that kind of people from this world. The Tribe of Savage Beasts... ...are scattered all throughout the lands. Scattered all throughout? The blood of the Tribe of Savage Beasts... ...will completely seep through the entire country. From our children, and then to our grandchildren... ...and to their children's children and so forth. There will be shinobi in their blood for sure. The blood of those inhuman people... ...who live only for their desires, and care not for the feelings of others... ...will be flowing through every corner of the whole world. So no one was able to find Mumon? No. Nobukatsu-sama ordered us not to leave any stone unturned... ...but we couldn't find his head at all. But according to a captured person from Iga... ...he was certain he saw Mumon during the war here. What I heard was... ...he came to look for a kid. A kid? Was it Mumon's child? No, no, no... It was some orphan kid... Not adorable at all. He wasn't human... ...but he wanted to be one, huh. If that's true... ...how much will you give me? From then on, I was raised by my father. I don't remember my mother's face much... But Father said she was very beautiful... ...and an extremely... ...scary person. 誰だって そう 探してる Everyday Dare datte sou sagashiteru Everyday Everybody is looking for it Everyday 彷徨い歩いて 幸せの場所まで Samayoi aruite Shiawase no basho made Wandering and walking, Til they reach a place of happiness Why? 何か起きるサイン Why?
