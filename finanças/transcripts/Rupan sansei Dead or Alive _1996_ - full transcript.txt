Burn in hell, you bastard! You ain't gonna live long enough to see me on that guillotine, pig! This one will do. And this one. Get that one too. Oh yeah, and that one. You know there are only two ways out of this prison: Death by execution, or death by "natural" causes. But tonight I'm going to give you four a chance to change your fate. You see, the front gate is open. If you have what it takes to get out alive, you're free men. Simple as that. What do you say? It's not like you have anything else to lose. Better get going. You've got five minutes before we start shooting. It's a shame we only play this game once a year. There's nothing quite like the thrill of hunting down a man and watching him squirm. Yes, well I'm sure you'll make quick sport of them as usual. Sir! He what? I don't get it. Does this still mean we're free to go? Hey, hey watch it! I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing! Yeah, yeah. Lighten up, Jigen. We're overweight as it is. Land, Lupin. This is it? Guess so. Look, I don't get it. If General Headhunter knows the treasure's... hidden somewhere on this island- How come he hasn't he gotten his hands on it yet? Yeah. That's the million dollar question, isn't it? And it's what we're here to find out. An entire armored division. This battle was over before it began. This is some place, huh? Yeah. State of the art, from the looks... of it, or at least it used to be. What you think all this stuff was for? Beats me. But judging by the décor, it's safe to say it was some kinda' project for the late king. Lupin. Game of poker gone wrong? Headhunter's work. “Chief Director Dr. Voltsky“ Rest in peace, Doc. Rest in peace. Now this looks like a nice place to hide some treasure. What the hell happened down here? Looks like a vault to me. Let's crack 'er open. Goemon. Now might be a good time to leave! What? You scared of a couple pointy sticks? No, I'm staying here Jigen! Million dollar question, yeah right. Okay. So what's on Drifting Island that's worth getting killed over, anyway? Well give me a second, and I'll show you. I'm hacking into the Zufu mainframe right now. And here we go. Check this out. Whoa! Someone could use a new web designer. I'm not talking j-pegs Jigen. The former Zufu king turned that whole island... into a safe house for the national treasury, just to keep it out of the hands of... enterprising thieves like, well like us. But anyway two years ago, things went bad for the old king. And he and his son Prince Pannish were killed in a coup d'état. Now the island's been seized by the leader of the coup who has appointed himself ruler. That's the guy in the picture you're... looking at, General Headhunter. That's a mean looking S.O.B. Believe me, the painting doesn't do him justice. He's worse than mean. What would you say? Sound like the kinda'... score that's worth getting killed over? I'll give you two. The price is five. That's robbery! No, that's taxes! And that's my final price! This isn't worth my spit! You think you can find it somewhere else, be my guest! Well maybe I will! Hey! What do you think you're doing? We're busted. Run! Oh no you don't! Come back here! You brats! I better not catch you near my stall again! They're back! Well ain't that all. Prissy little thing like you thinks she's gonna beat me? Trust me, honey. I may be small, but I'm very flexible. Begin! She's out cold! We have a winner! Who is this woman? Sir, Fujiko Mine. Apparently, she's a new arrival here. Inspector Zenigata of the I.C.P.O., I presume? Yes sir. My name is Crisis, with the National Police. Huh. The I.C.P.O. Report was a bit vague, Inspector. What brings you to our country? I'm here to apprehend Lupin the 3rd. Lupin? Greetings, to all of you in Zufu. Oh, hang on. I'm sure it's not easy keeping all the treasure on Drifting Island all to yourself, General Headhunter. So I'm gonna go ahead and take it off your hands. Or my name isn't Lupin the 3rd! I believe you also received a copy, correct? All right then. Let's go. Wow. Looks like you people are gearing up for a war here. Why all the big guns? I'm sure I don't need to remind you, Inspector, we are a peaceful nation. However, the General feels... Stop the car! Pannish. What's wrong? It's nothing. Drive! So, where'd you boys say you fly off to again? Nowhere. We just wanted to take a bird's-eye view of the city. Humph. Treasure hunters, eh? Treasure hunters? No, sorry. We're just here to see the sights. Well then, it's a shame not one of you "sight-seers" remembered to bring a camera. Anyway, here's a little information that might interest you. You know General Headhunter's got a daughter? Yeah. Emerah, right? That's her. Anyway, they say that Emerah's the only one with the key to unlocking the secrets of Drifting Island. And they say she's just dying to get away from the General. So, if someone were to help her out, she... might give them the key to the island. If someone's not too busy sight-seeing. Hey, I'll tell you what. I think I want to place another order. I need an advertising balloon, and a buoy! What's that? Oh! What's going on up there? Ah, here you are, sir. I'm sorry to disturb you, but it's important. I thought you should know. I-I believe I saw Pannish. Where was this? Uh-At the airport, sir. As I recall, you executed Pannish two years ago. Yes. I-I realize how unbelievable it- You believe this Lupin character would... actually risk coming here for Emerah? Lupin may be a thief, General, but he's a man of his word. If he says he's coming, he's coming. What's wrong? Evening boys. Who was that? Come on! After him! This is sentry post number two! Come in, dammit! It's an emergency! How much longer should we wait, Inspector? I'm beginning to wonder if Lupin is nearly as resourceful as you claim. With all due respect General, I know this man. He'll be here. In fact, he's here now. Guards! Unknown glider approaching from the southeast! Guards! Dammit! Answer me! I've got you now, Lupin! Emerah! Sorry, pops! But the girl's got a date with me! Idiot! You call yourself a professional? If anything happens to her, I'll have your head! Look, I know. But before we start playing the blame game, how 'bout we wait fill all the facts are in, okay? What? Emerah. But-You'd better start explaining, Inspector! It's the old' switcheroo. No one knows Lupin better than me. So what exactly are you planning to do with me? Well, you've been wanting to get away from your father, right? Maybe the three of us can help you out with that. Really? Of course, we're hoping you'll find it in your heart to... give us a reward for smuggling you out of the country. For example: If you were to tell us everything you know about Drifting Island- So, that's what this is about. Uh-huh. And after you give us the low-down, we'll drop you off anywhere you want to go. Aww, good god! You call this coffee? Aw, I'm sorry. You wanted French Vanilla? Um, excuse me. I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke. Mmm. That's terrific. You want some cream and sugar? I know I do. We're wasting time here. Let's go! Trouble? Oh, we're surrounded. Seriously? Yup. And from the looks of it, they brought the whole damn army. Guess we should've figured Headhunter... was the 'overprotective father' type. Well, you really got to hand it to 'em. I didn't think they'd find this place so quick. Try not to waste too much ammo. If we have to buy more bullets in town, it'll cost a fortune. We're outnumbered ten to one, and you're worried about your wallet. Freeze! Careful now. That's not a toy. Keep slinging that thing around, someone's liable to get hurt. Yes, I realize that. It'd be a shame if it were you. I'm an agent of the National Police Bureau, And you're all under arrest. I get it now. So the General thought he'd pull a fast one on us. The General's not that creative. Inspector Zenigata of the I.C.P.O. Came up with this plan. Pops, you dog. Personally, I'm surprised you were snared so easily. Yeah, so what's your point? What do you think? You'll be turned over to General Headhunter for punishment. Goemon! Hey, that's enough! We came to arrest them, not kill them! This is how we deal with criminals in Zufu, Inspector. Call it 'swift justice'. Don't these guys know it's rude to kill a lady? It's the General's way of doing things. Yeah, well I hope at least you got a good dental plan. Is that guy in the picture a friend of yours? Sorry, he just looks familiar to me. I'm pretty sure I've seen him around town here. When was this? Couple days ago. Then it must've been someone else. Sheesh. Some party. Hey! There you are. Unfortunately. Lupin! Ah. You're here. Perfect timing. Check this out. Hey, didn't we see that guy in a bar downtown a couple days ago? Told ya'! And I told you, that's not possible! He... he's been dead for two years. They're here! Take that ya bastards! Someone's at the door! Hi-ya! End of the line. That's right. There's no way out. Hmm... Maybe, maybe not. Guess that's really up to you, isn't it? So, what's your name? Ole... Oleander. Oleander? Right! Oleander! Like the flower! The one that's supposed to symbolize beauty and honesty? Yes, it can also symbolize danger and death, so watch it! Orders, sir? Sorry! Guess we'll have to figure out which... "Ole" is the real you some other time! See you around! I trust you'll be most eager to leave our country, Inspector, now that your work is done. Well Ole, you're all right. Come, now. No need to taint the excellent... job you did, leading us to Lupin. You're a resourceful girl. I knew you'd... find a way to make it out alive. Lupin got away. Yes. In a manner of speaking. There's no way he could have survived that fall. The fall! You have no idea who you're dealing with. He's survived a whole lot worse than that! Trust me. He's out there. Zenigata! Tomorrow, you will be on the first plane out of the country, do you hear me? If I catch you in Zufu again, I'll have you arrested! And then I'll throw away the key! You ready to jet? Yep. I'm honored that you would trust me to protect your daughter, sir. It's not that I trust you. It's that I trust her even less. Emerah. This is Fujiko. She will be your new adviser. It will be my pleasure to serve you, Miss. All right. So start by leaving. Now don't let her out of your sight. As you wish, Sir. I don't want you here! Just go away. Your father wouldn't be very happy with me. He's not my father. I- I'm sorry. I don't understand. I'm the only one who knows the secrets of Drifting Island. Uh, Drifting Island? You're not very good at playing dumb. You're after the treasure. I could spot you from a mile away. Well, that's not exactly- Seriously, do you think you can get me out of here? If you do, I'll tell you the secret. Oh. That's a little easier said than done. Hmm... I know. Leave it all to me. I have a plan. How would you like that? What's a pretty ”I“ thing like you doing out here all by yourself? I'm looking for someone. Out of my way. You know, that kinda' attitude's gonna get you in trouble if you are not careful. Now you be a good Little' girl and... tell me who it is you're looking for? It's been a long time. You look good, Ole. So it really is true. You're alive. You're alive. I'm sorry. I've been in hiding for the... last two years, organizing the resistance. Resistance? To defeat Headhunter, the man who tried to murder me, and then took over our country by murdering my father. But, but I heard the King had you killed. You heard Headhunter's story. He used it as his excuse for seizing control from my father. But if the General wasn't acting to avenge your death, then all of this time... all of this time I- You were deceived. The whole country was deceived. Help me now. Stay with Headhunter. Gather all the information you can to help the resistance. You can contact me at any time with this. Remember, the transmitter operates between 80 and 130hz. Isn't there anything else I can do to help? No, I'm afraid I've already put you in too much danger as it is. I'll come again! Pannish! All right. Are you the man that called? Yes. And you're sure this is the man you saw? Oh, I'd bet my life on it. He's sitting in the back, there. Right. Let's go. More than ever, it is vital to our... nation's survival that we continue... to reinforce the defensive... capabilities of our military forces. And it is for this reason that the decision has... been made to raise the consumption tax to 20%. This increase will take effect as of 12 noon today. You were warned loud and clear. It is a matter of deep personal regret... what would happen if you stayed. That the financial burden in the country, Zenigata. Of our nation's defense must be shouldered. - We're taking you in. - So heavily by its citizens, C'mon, cut me some slack, will ya'? However it is a burden - I'm a cop, same as you. - That each and every citizen. Tell you what. We'll put in a good word... for you with all the other inmates. Has a responsibility to bear. They're gonna love you. Order up! Let's get one thing straight, As long as Lupin's here, I'm here. And I am not leaving the country... until I have him in custody, got it? You tell that to your boss, Crisis. With each passing day. - You! - The threat of attack. Don't shoot! From outside our borders looms larger. Something's tells me, and unless our military might... those men'll need a cup of coffee when they come to. Is significantly increased. Attention, citizens of Zufu! This is an important message from the Resistance Movement. I am the son of the former king, who was... deposed by General Headhunter, Prince Pannish! P- Prince Pannish? General Headhunter believes me to be dead, but as you can see, I am still very much alive! The man who General Headhunter murdered two years ago. - He's on all frequencies. - Was my decoy! I was forced into hiding, and unfortunately the truth was hidden along with me. But for the last two years I have been... working to organize a Resistance Movement. Our only goal: To defeat General Headhunter! This cruel dictator has ruled Zufu with an iron fist, and treated its citizens like animals! But together, we will remove the shadow of tyranny from our land! Citizens of Zufu, you will have your freedom! And to think, you had an opportunity... to capture him at the airport. Don't fail me again. Find him, and bring him to me. Dead or alive, General? I want him taken alive. He's of no use to me otherwise, is that clear? Sir. It seems fortune has smiled on me. La cucarachas, la cucarachas! I can't walk anymore! I got-Oh, hey there's a cat! I can't feel my face-Oh, hey guys! Having a good time, Spanky? You're gonna get yourself caught. And after all the damn trouble we went to. Yeah. You still owe us for busting you out of prison. Where are we going? Guess you wanna know 'bout Drifting Island, huh? That's right. So why don't you go ahead and start talking. You think 'cause I was one of the king's advisors that, that I'm gonna have some information... to help you out, but uh... Yeah? But what? But all I know is it's impossible for anyone to get to that treasure. Well, that's not gonna stop us from trying. You've been out there. You got attacked, right? Yeah. What was all that? That, friend, was the guardian of the island. Nanomachine! Come again? What you're saying is, this "Nanomachine" is some kind of security system put in place to defend the treasure? That's what I'm saying. So, there's got to be some way to get past it, right? No way in hell. Hurry! Are you sure about this? What's going to happen to you when he finds out I'm gone? Let me worry about that. All you need to do is tell me the secret of Drifting Island. Promise me you won't try to go out there? But why? For your own safety. My real father, Dr. Voltsky, designed the security system that protects that island. You can't get past it! Right. Except, you know the secret to shutting it down, don't you? No. What? I'm so sorry. You see, just before he was murdered, my father told General Headhunter that I was the only one who could unlock the secrets of Drifting Island. But that was a lie he told in order... to protect me. I don't know anything. You're kidding. But you know, if you can get into Headhunter's computer, you might find some clues there. There's an idea. Thanks for everything. Take care! Oh yeah. You too. Ah, General. Hello. Emerah dear, your father is here to see you. I don't want you here! Emerah! Just go away. Stay with her. Yes, sir! I won't let her out of my sight. Yes, that's right. His troops are still spread out pretty thin along the outer walls. Looks like the western side is probably... the most vulnerable to attack. I think it'll be a while before he can get reinforcements. Right. Okay. I'll look into it. No, wait! Pannish! Nothing up my sleeve. And presto! You do know the reason why I opened this bar for you. Yes. Pannish is no longer the man you once knew. He's staging a coup. Manipulating the citizens into rising up against the General. I saw the broadcast. Don't be fooled. If he has his way, he'll undo every bit of progress we've made. The General wants this problem taken... care of as quickly as possible. Ole, find Pannish, and locate the... headquarters of the Resistance Movement. That is your duty to the General. I know my duty. Don't forget, I gave you your job with the National Police. I can take it away. I'll get the job done. 'Kay. That's all, kids. - Aw, come on man! - Do one more! Please, please, please! I want you to keep your eyes on Ole. A tail? C'mon you know that's a waste of my talents. But, hey! I'm your man. I don't mind the extra work. Long as you don't mind throwing some extra grease my way. Looks like your plan for getting the word out really did the trick. I saw your post on the internet. A one million dollar reward to anyone... who can bring in Lupin and his crew. "Dead or Alive." That's one sweet deal. Yes, sir. Oh, hey! Wait a second! I'm right behind you! Hope it wasn't something I said. I don't have time to concern myself with petty crooks like Lupin, not while Pannish is still out there. Well, don't you worry, Sir. I'll find all those bastards for you. So, you say these are some bits of... sand you brought back from the island? Yeah. I just want to take a closer look. Huh. What is that? Some metal or something? Ah, check it out! It's moving! Whoa! Let me get a detailed analysis. The Nanomachine! So that's what Spanky was talking about! Let's see. The Nanomachine is the ultimate weapon, can be controlled with complete precision... in units as small as one nanometer, has diverse humanitarian and technological applications. In medicine, units can be injected directly into the bloodstream to eradicate harmful bacteria, yadda yadda yadda, can be used in the manufacture of next... generation micro-circuits, etcetera. From the report by Dr. Voltsky. That's the dead guy from the island, huh? Right! Man! This is turning out to be a... little more complicated than I hoped. All that stuff it does, it almost sounds... like the Nanomachine is the treasure. Hmm. Sure does. Hit me! One more round! This is the last one, okay? Come on I- Well, well, well. Now this is a surprise. Now what would a top agent like you... be doing in a little place like this? Hope I'm not blowing your cover. I'll take a beer. Now. You and I need to talk. Leave me alone. I'm busy. That 30? Besides, there's nothing left to talk about. Wrong. I need to know if there's a way to deactivate the Nanomachine. I told ya'! It's impossible. Okay. So who did the king hope to leave his treasure to when he died? Who do you think? His son, Prince Pannish. Prince Pannish, huh? That's what I said! Sorry. I forgot, you don't like smoke. Don't like smoke! But I love to drink! It's the only thing I got left anymore. I think he's about had it for tonight. One more round for my cat. Pannish! Lupin the 3rd, you should be more careful. Don't you know there's a price on your head? That's right. A million dollars, dead or alive. And it's all mine. You little- What are you doing? Are you crazy? Hey there beautiful. Going my way? All right, then. It's been fun. This is like my stop, though. Oh no, the fun's just getting started! You're mine, Lupin the 3rd. What? You know me? Are you kidding? Everyone in this city knows who you are! You're the million dollar man, and I'm gonna collect! Great. So you're after the reward money too, huh? You better believe it! Hey loverboy! What the-Pops? The ladies always were your weakness, weren't they, Lupin? Hey! What about me? Come back! You know, I've been after you a long time, Lupin. Feels like my whole life I've been... dreaming of the day I'd bring you in. But it's funny. Now that I've got the prize, I'm already... starting to miss the thrill of the chase. Hey, believe me, I know the feeling, Pops. Yeah, sure. You're just saying that, aren't you? Nah, not really. I've chased after a few prizes myself. Listen to me. I guess I shouldn't complain. I got my whole life ahead of me. And you, Lupin the Third, have life in jail! Your call is going through now. All right. So bring me the phone! Oh, I'm sorry. You'll have to take it upstairs. The cord's not long enough. I'll be back. If he so much as blinks, you shout. Got it? Yes, yes. What? You sure don't look like a big time thief to me. Well, I got an innocent face. But I can be pretty crafty. Prove it. What? You got to be kidding me! I've got an emergency here! That's too late! How hard is it to round up one helicopter? Look! I've got Lupin the 3rd here! How long do you think I can hold him in a place like this? Oh, come on sir! Traffic- Okay fine. I'll wait! Okay. Five a. M. At- Right, we'll be there. Thanks for nothing! Real cozy. Now, let's see. If I were a computer system... No, not here. Dammit! Now that's weird. Hello. Okay, we're in business. Now, we'll take a look at the General's recent file history. Here we go. Damn, I'm good. And, copy. C'mon already. What the- Wh-Where's it coming from? Pannish. The forest, outside the western gate. Yes! Oh, hello Crisis. Go back to your room. You! Men! To the western gate! Pannish! We just gave the Headhunter a little fireworks show! Are you hurt? Fan out! Comb the area! Teams of two! Search door to door! Can I help you? They're gone. Thank you. It's too risky to go out the front. I'll let you out the back door. Thanks for everything, Ole. You're gonna get yourself killed for real this time. That's not going to happen. Oh no? Trust me. Headhunter wouldn't be fool enough to kill me twice. You don't have to worry about me. You just look after yourself. We begin the attack again tomorrow at sunrise. It won't be safe for you here. Find some place to hide until this all blows over. I'll take care of Headhunter. Why? So you can take his place? No, that's not what I want at all. I... What? I just want everyone to be happy again. Take care of yourself. Wait! You say you just want everyone to be happy again... So does that... Does that include me? I'll tell you this- soon as your trial's over, I'm heading back home for some long overdue R&R. Maybe I'll see what kind of sway my... new-found celebrity has on the ladies! Then I'm gonna write my autobiography and... have it published all over the world! I've already got the title picked out and everything. "Lupin! You're Under Arrest!" By Inspector Zenigata. Pretty catchy, huh? At first I was going to call it "War," but I... didn't want any of my female readers to be upset. So then I decided to call it "Love and War," but then... I didn't want people to get the wrong idea about us. Whoa! It's windy! What's wrong with you? You're being awfully quiet. Guess the thought of life in a prison cell has a way of drying up the witty repartee. But this book does concern you too, you know- It can't be. Lupin! What's the point of dragging us out here? I really don't see how this time's gonna be any different. We still don't have the key to getting past Nanomachine. Don't you have any faith in me? We'll figure it out when we get there! Yeah great. Good. I'll... I'll guard the boat. Oh that's nice! I trusted you Ole. And you have abused that trust. I know everything. I know that you've been conspiring with Pannish! You're a traitor. And you will pay the price for your betrayal! Where is Pannish! Where is he hiding? Speak, traitor! Tell me where he is! Spare yourself this misery! Crisis, you always were soft. General. I haven't broken her yet, Sir, but- I will give you one chance to save your life. And one chance only. Tell me what I need to know, or die. Sir! Sir! General! The resistance army has begun its attack! I see. And is Pannish with them? No, sir. That is, we don't know. You useless scum! Now start talking. Drifting Island. Look out! - It's the resistance! - Get to your posts! - They're inside the gates! - Defensive positions! All right. This is as far as I go. Just let me know when you figure something out. Hey, thank you. Hey, boys. 'Bout time you got here. Hey Fujiko! Are, uh, you sure you know what you're doing? Pretty sure. Still, it seems pretty dangerous messing with this. Come on boss, you might as well let her. She can't do any worse than we did. Barn! From what I can tell, most of the research they were doing for the Nanomachine was years ahead of its time. The energy source is a solar battery. And it's a self-repairing machine, so between the two it can pretty much run indefinitely. Yeah, but with this disk, it looks like you might be able to- That's right. It's got an emergency shutdown program. Tell us. I haven't figured that out yet. My best guess is it has something to do with the gate. Hey! What's the deal? I wasn't finished looking. The deal is, I risked my life to get these files. You wanna see more, it's gonna cost you. All right, all right! So we'll work together! We split 70/30. You heard me, mister. I want 70 percent. My services don't come cheap. Now hold on! Of course, if you boys think you can manage to get the... treasure without me, you're welcome to give it a shot. I dunno, Boss. 70 percent is starting to sound like a bargain. All right. Where is Pannish hiding? I won't ask you again. Is it the gate? Has he gone inside the gate? We will find him one way or another. Don't throw away your life for nothing. Go ahead and kill me if that's what you want. It's what you're planning to do once you finish Pannish, isn't it? Sir, I'm not sure it's safe to proceed. It's safe enough if Pannish is here. But, sir. Obviously, Crisis, you haven't yet realized that Pannish... is the key to unlocking this system. But then, you haven't studied the old data files the way I have. The machine should remain inactive as... long as it detects Pannish in the area. Just as I thought. He's inside? Pannish! Do you hear me? I know that you're here! Don't bother hiding! Open the gate! Now! Don't be a fool! I have your woman, Pannish! Her life depends on your decision! Open this gate, or she dies where she stands! Don't bother. I named this place, but all I was trying... to do was lead you away from the palace. This gate? You suggested he was here all on your own. But he's not. Pannish isn't anywhere near this place! So if Pannish isn't here, where is he? He's back in the city. And by now the... battle should have already begun! The Resistance is attacking, and you... aren't even there to lead your army! It's Pannish. So he was here all along. Look. This is our fight. Let Ole go! First, you open the gate. Then we'll discuss your woman. Sorry it took me so long. Are you okay? I noticed the helicopter, and I followed. Take off your pendant. But- Your pendant. Take it off. I need to borrow it. Beautiful. What is that? It's the control system for the Nanomachine. You know, your father, the king, it was his dream that this technology would one day be used to create peace and prosperity for every last man, woman, and child in this country. Needless to say, we didn't see eye to eye on the matter. And so that's why you killed him and tried to kill me! Isn't it! Yes. Though, as you can imagine, I soon came to wish... that I had not been so hasty to order your execution. Now, it seems all of my wishes have come true. Observe. With this system, the power of the... Nanomachine is at my complete disposal. I'll be able to crush your Resistance in a single stroke. I have what is essentially the world's most powerful army right here, in the palm of my hand. And now that I have that, I no longer need you. - Lupin! - Lupin! Aw, great! It doesn't detect Pannish anymore! You gonna throw that switch of yours today, Fujiko? I'm on it! Got any more bright ideas while you're at it? Watch it, Goemon! You should have never come to Zufu, Lupin. C'mon! Ole, you okay? Let's go. Yahoo! Oh now this... This is nice. Rolling hills of gold. You see, this is what the Nanomachine... used as its basic building block, gold, reduced to the atomic level. And when I activated the emergency... shutdown disk, it brought it all back! So tell me something. At what point did... you figure out that I was Pannish? When we kissed. I knew the instant our lips met that you weren't him. Well, I must be a little out of practice. But there's one thing I don't understand. It's the only thing I got left anymore. One more round for my cat. Pannish! Right. I was pretty proud of myself for that one. I had Jigen give me a hand. But now I dunno. I guess it was a pretty cheap trick to play on you. Now where do you think they're going? Lupin the 3rd. Hey uh, sorry boss, but we're taking off. What do you mean you're taking off? And what am I supposed to do, swim back? We just don't feel like dealing with that guy behind you. Ha ha! Gotcha! Aww, Pops! Geez! Doesn't the old man ever quit? Aw, come on Pops! You're a wanted man too! If any of the General's men find us out here, they'll lock us both up! You don't got to worry about that! The Resistance took care of the General, and the country's back in the hands of the citizens, where it belongs! So, peace and happiness have finally returned to Zufu, huh? And I'm gonna have peace and happiness too! Soon as I have you locked up in jail! C'mon pops, you don't really wanna do that. What about the thrill of the chase? And you're out! I've been practicing that one. Pretty good, eh? Just give up, Lupin. You're not slipping these cuffs the way you slipped those ropes, Might as well sit, Lupin. We're gonna be here a while. So what's your part in all this? You with the General? The Resistance? What's your story? Fine, been nice talking with you. Wait. Inspector Zenigata? Yeah? What will happen to Lupin? How should I know? Thank you for a beautiful dream. That's it, huh? Some score. All that work, and what do we end up with? A Nano-control box that isn't worth squat. Quit complaining. The only thing I have to show for this is a stupid computer disk. Where you going? I've had about as much as I can stand... of this country. I'm heading west. The wind is calling, from the east. Well, it's down south for me. Here. Maybe you can use it as a coaster or something. Good old General Headhunter. Not much in the looks department. But he did have a heart of gold. Ahh! Now this is the life! Can you... imagine sleeping in this every night? I'd say we ended up with a pretty good... haul for the trip. So what's next? I'm still going west. My path leads east. Like I said, it's down south for me. Well then, I guess to make it all nice and tidy. I'll go north!
