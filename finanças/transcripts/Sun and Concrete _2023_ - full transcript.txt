Constantin Film presents A Seven Elephants production In co-production with Constantin Film Production "That's exactly what happened. But then again, maybe it wasn't." Stop! Student ID. You know me! I've been a student for four years. No ID, no school. It's the first time I forgot it. I always have it with me, man! No ID, no school. You'll make me fail the year! No can do. - Let me in. No, right? Or can he go in? No, you can't go in. I don't know any Lukas. Go. Fuck it. Hey, fuckface, shouldn't you be at school? You skipped school! Fuck off! SUN AND CONCRETE We're going to see highs of 95 degrees again today. The first deaths have been reported. Stay in the shade and drink plenty of fluids. HI GINO, COME TO LIPSCHITZ STREET I'M SKIPPING SCHOOL ... majority support for his "Agenda 2010." Hey! - How's it going? Didn't feel like school? - No, fuck school, Gino. Scared of getting caught? We can go to my place. - I was gonna pick up Julius. Julius? - Yeah. Seriously? We haven't hung out in ages, bro. And now you want to bring Julius! You didn't even ask me, bro. Alright, guys? What's the plan? Let's go hit Gropius, Gino. It's way too hot for the mall. - Bro! Gino's coming to my place. - Seriously? It'll be full of hot bitches in this heat, man. Yeah. - Right! It's 9 a.m. man! They're all at school. Guys, if you're not into chasing chicks, let's just hang out and get bored to death. Let's get some weed. Yeah, man. See, that sounds like a plan. Let's go, man. Let's go, Julius. Fuck that shit! He won't pick up. Maybe he's all out. Let's go to the park. Cem's always got some. The park? - Yeah. It's crap there. We don't have shit. Let's go around instead, boys. Cem's always at the end of the park. I don't wanna walk past the Arab dealers. Stop shitting your pants. - Gino, come with me at least. Did you hear about Marek and his Polish crew? They got in a serious brawl with the Johannisthal guys. Fucking disaster! Fists were flying! - Were you there? Your brother was. - I bet he punched their lights out. Marek flipped out. He got some guy with a punch dagger. Bam! Dropped a bomb on his face. Full of blood. The dude's just dead. Like a movie, man. Boys, what you need? Speed? Coke? Grass? I'll give you a great deal. Hey, look at us! - Ignore them. They're trouble. Don't walk away! I'll give you a good price! A good price! - Come here! Thanks, man, but we're good. What are you doing? - What? Then why you here? You can sunbathe by the pool. To see Cem, that son of a whore Turk? - No, we're not buying. And we don't buy from fucking Turks. Shut up! Let's go! What the fuck? You pulling him away? Well? I should kick your ass, motherfucker! Hey, chill. He didn't mean to be unfriendly. Shut the fuck up, fucking German! Thanks, but we're in a hurry. You fucking with me? What's wrong with you? Fucking fag! Fucking German! Retard! Want me to fuck you up? - Thank you, but... Dumb dog! German cunt! - Hit him! Hit him, cousin! Stay down! - He deserves it! Stand up, you fuck! Don't come back, got it? Got it? Yes? Say yes! Yes. Get lost. - Don't let me see you here again! My dad'll kill me, man. That guy! I swear, I was gonna... Do what? Punch him? Fuck him up? You wimped out, just like Gino and me. What the hell? What kind of friends are you? Are you a retard, Julius? "We don't buy from fucking Turks"? What if Cem hears that? Anyone got a smoke? Thanks. Whatever. Let's go see Cem, or it was all for nothing. Two, four, five... Two. Enough? - Let's change it first. Dealers hate small change. - I'll handle it, man. What's up? What's up? I need a dime. "A dime". - "A dime". What's up with you? You think I'm a bum, man? Idiot! I said bills, paper. Is that so hard to understand? A dime! - Don't bring us that shit again! Got it? - Were you collecting bottles? Where are the guys? - Back there. Why are you standing there? Come here. - Show some respect and say hello. What happened to you, Lukas? Nothing, I'm fine. - Nothing? Your whole face is fucked up. - I fell, Cem, that's all. Who was it? Who did this? - No one, I swear. The Arabs fucked us up. - Shut it! In the park? - Yeah. What? - You know what they called you? What? What? "Son of a whore". - What did you say? "Fucking Turks," they said. - Did you hear it too? Did you hear it? - I don't know. They beat my buyers and talk shit! Call Ali! We're gonna fuck them up! Call Ali, Babi. Call Ali! A club or brass knuckles? We'll fuck them up. Don't let them hit you, okay? You take the first shot, got it? Come on, guys. I told you I'd handle it. What am I supposed to do? No idea, Lukas. I want to get out of here. - Me too. Guys, Cem and his crew will fuck up the Arabs and we'll get a good deal. Did I do good, or what? - Fuck off, you're an idiot. Cem, Ali's coming too! - Tamam, bro. Call your brother. He'll fix it. I can't always call Marco! You know what? I'm gonna beat that spaz. Son of a whore! He deserves it, Gino. I didn't do a thing! I'll just whack him in the face with this thing. Come on, Lukas. Come here Go on, hit me! Hit me! Lukas! Lukas, bro! Lukas! Drive, man! Please board the train. Come on, man! Hold him, hold him! Come on, guys! What the fuck? I'll get out at the next stop. You want me to whack you, man? How much does Cem give you? How much? - Nothing. That motherfucker stole 200 euros from us! But what can you do, eh? It's your fault. You're gonna pay it back. 500. I thought 200? 500! - I don't have that much. We'll hunt you down in Gropius. We'll come to your school if we gotta. I'll fuck up your family if I gotta! Understood? Yes. Give me your ID. - I don't have one. Your student ID. - I don't have it. You little fucker! Tomorrow. 3 p.m. in the park. 3 p.m. in the park. Please stand clear. What's with your face, egghead? Shut the fuck up, runt. - Fuck off, man! This isn't Charlottenburg. - I noticed! Yeah, calm down. Can you describe the boys who did it? No. - Stay away from kids like that. Just look at him! - Smart guys give in. Don't forget it. You went to school like that? Look at you! Yeah, I looked. - Oh, man! First Marco, now you're mixed up in fighting too. It makes me sick, Lukas. Really! Karin is visiting and my son looks like some ghetto idiot! Hi, Lukas! - Hi, Lukas! Like I said, smart guys give in. "Smart guys give in!" Like I had a choice! - You always have a choice! Can you take Fabian to school tomorrow? You don't have enough credit. Fuck, man. Marco? - Salaam alaikum, bro. What are you doing here? Pizza. You staying the night? Stop staring, you won't get one. I have my own. - Your own, yeah? Kidding. I don't smoke. - Quit laughing! You gonna tell me? Tell you what? - Have you seen yourself? It's nothing. - Nothing? You look like a zombie! You brawled with Arabs! How do you know? - How? This is my fucking hood. Little birdies tell me what goes on here. And the other guy? He's at the hospital. - Yo, Rocky! Stop it. - What? Looks like shit anyways. Like I said: if they have a knife, get the fuck out. Otherwise, you grab your lighter and fuck him up, got it? "Yes, Marco"! - Yes. Show some attitude! I got it. Smart guys don't give in. Smart guys hit back. Left, right, bam! Now go to your room. Fuck off, go to your room! Got your student ID? You'll get it back tomorrow. What can I do? Nothing. You can't defend yourself, you're a nobody. Look at your clothes! If they want to rob you, they will. Here's a tip: take the bus. It takes longer, but you won't run into them. You're a typical German loser. Blond, skinny, shitty haircut. Don't you have a school bag? What happened to your face, bro? Gino, you okay? What's up? Can someone please get some chalk? Can one of you get some chalk? - I'll go. One of you. Not all of... Fine, three of you... Shut up! Hey... - Shh! Quiet! They want 500 euros. From you? - Not from me, from us. Quiet down! Gino? How much do you have? Why do I smell smoke? Maybe it's a fuse? Lukas? You have a great feel for language. It's college level. Woo-hoo, Dr. Lukas! - Unlike you, Momo. I have 40 euros at home. And you? I dunno. A few euros, but I was saving up. Saving up? They're gonna kill us! - You took off! You guys fucked up too! That's enough! You all get a reprimand! Where's the attendance book? - Why do I get a reprimand? I didn't do anything, Mr. Wednesday! My name is Mr. Saturday! Calm down, people! What's going on here? What's going on? So strict today, Jürgen? Nice threads! Mr. Thingy, hey! Mr. Thingy, Mr. Thursday gave us reprimands for no reason. It's unfair. I didn't do anything either! Calm down! - Is that true? Hey, hey! Where have you been? Getting chalk. - Chalk? Three of you? - Mr. Wednesday told us to! Okay, folks. Calm down. It's my pleasure to introduce your new classmate. He comes from Marzahn-Hellersdorf. I thought Hellersdorf guys were Nazis. He's the first black one I've seen. Look David, another nigga! Shut the fuck up, fucking Kebab! Hey, I'm not a nigga. I'm a Caribbean boy. Anyway, here's the news: The press is here today for our big announcement. Have you seen Didem? Mad tits, man! What about the money? We got till 3 p.m. Will you go get it? My nose hurts like hell. I can hardly breathe. Okay, I'll get the money. - Thanks. Hello, hello! Thank you. Great, thank you. Thanks for coming. I'm really glad to tell you that we have some positive news this time. Today we have a special guest from the Senate Department for Education. Here is Mr. Reuter! He tripped! Quiet, please. Quiet down! Hey! Quiet down! Anyone can stumble. It can happen to any of us. It's five steps. How can you trip? What an embarrassment! Quiet down now! Quiet! We have a fantastic announcement and I don't want to keep you waiting. Curtains, please. The Berlin council has provided our school with 50 brand new computers! Finally we can offer computer science, giving you a head start to a successful career. To tell you more, here is Ms. Staake from Neukölln District Administration. Gino? Come here, time to eat! It's important to eat together, right? Sit up straight. Why aren't you eating? Did you mess up the spices? Can I leave? - Where are you going? I have to go back to school. - Sure, go. No, no, no! How's it going at school? Good. Yeah? Your teacher called. You know what he said? He said... you skip school almost every day. Is that true? Yes. You skip school? Almost every fucking day? That's the truth? It's very important. I'm going. - You're not going anywhere! Keep out of this! You little bastard! Gino? I can't come. Here, from Grandma. I've almost saved enough for us to visit her. Fuck! Oh, man! Hey, you good? You get away okay? Because I bailed, you mean? - I mean the cops, man. Oh, yeah. Do you know a Denise? What class? No idea, bro. Don't even know if she's at this school. I met her at the pool. I even got her number, but I lost the slip of paper. A smoking hot babe. I tell you, I'm gonna fuck her so hard... The Arabs want the money off of me. The 500 euros. - What? What the hell? They said you stole 200 off them. - I stole from them? Can't you give it back? - Give it back? Seriously? You an idiot? They won't get a cent! "Give it back". Who the fuck you think are you? They won't get a cent from me! How dare you ask me that, idiot? Fuck off. Okay, good luck with Denise. Call me, I've got fresh stuff. Tell your boys. Hello? - Yo! What's up, shithead? Julius? What's up? What's going on with you? You just bailed, man! They want 500, bro. - Bro... No one wants shit from me! And anyway... Who is it? - Djamel and his crew. Honestly, Lukas, fuck them. - Fuck them? I'm going to see my girl. Talk later. Yo, got any condoms? What? You don't even have hair on your balls! Can you lend me ten bucks? - Fuck off, cockroach! Get out of here! Man! What's going on? You live here? - Yes, here. What are you doing? - He wanted to help us move in. Put it down there. So, let's get something straight. Do you always rob your neighbors? Is that your scam? Did you steal anything else from us? I'm sorry, it was just... I hope you're sorry! What happened here? Who did it? Family? Then it's okay. Come here! What do you want? - Come here. Why don't you come in? - No time. No money? - Sure I do, but... Business, you know what I mean? I have to go. Is your mom always so funny? My mom's great, Loco. And yours? My mom is dead. What do you mean? Why is she dead? Seriously? Bro, how did... - Just zip it, okay? Fuck! - What d'you mean, fuck? You screwed up? - It's fine. It's good like that. Really Neukölln. Hold on. There's a hole, bro! Dad? - It's 3 p.m. Did you forget? Why do you say that? Your buddies. Homework. Hold on, I'll put them on. Lukas? It's me, Hamudi. Come home. You need your backpack tomorrow. For school. I don't have the money yet. That's not good, Lukas. That's not good. But I... Shit, man! Can I stay at your place? - Yeah, if you fix it. Why are you so scared of them? I owe them something. It's a long story. We'll figure it out. Trust me. Shit, this tastes so gross! Why did you buy it? I didn't buy it. I stole it, man. I won't steal that shit again. Is that them? Bro! Who was that? - Boom, man! Bon appétit! Go fuck yourself! What's up? You shit your pants? I was just fucking with 'em. You gotta do it. Their faces, man! Party tonight at Grenzallee, okay? Fuck the party! - What party, man? Please, man! - It sounds sick! Today we party. We'll fix your shit tomorrow. - Promise? Yeah. Guys, don't just leave me hanging. They probably forgot. Forgot? They were at my place! You said you'd get money! I need the money for my mom, Lukas. Sanchez! Go! Hey, stop! Stop! Fuck you! Did you ever do a girl? I don't just mean... kindergarten stuff. I mean for real, like putting it in? Ever kissed? Or licked? Ever touched a girl, bro? And you? - Are you fucking kidding? I'm an animal. Yeah, you fuck elephants. - Shut the fuck up, man! Do you agree, guys? Women are women, but moms... are goddesses? It's better to learn on an old bike, huh? - I didn't mean that! Who got the fucking joint wet, man? Oh, man... - That was my last gram from Hellersdorf! Stop laughing like a dumb fuck! Now for some real music. You hear that? Turn that shit off, man! It's Cuba style! - Is that pop shit? It's Reggaeton, man! Reggaeton? - He wants to meet girls. It goes like this: They stand here with their fat asses, okay? And you go... You don't stand around like Gino. See? Not like that 4/4 shit. This is music! - I swear, guys. You'll never get laid if you listen to music like this. You have no idea how crazy women go for Reggaeton. This is Neukölln, dude. Women here party to our music. That is music! We're gonna destroy your mom! Shit, you're retarded. Dipshit! Yeah, man! Guys, they're fucking hot. I'll get a phone number, I tell you. Forget it! - You know me, I'm good with girls. You're here, she's here. - You wait. You won't get her. - Wanna bet? Watch this. Hey, girls, I'm a plumber. Can I check your pipes? Eww! What's wrong with you? Wanna go out with us? We're already out. - Yeah, with us! Go somewhere or whatever. - Who is "us"? We're gonna party. Oh my God! Just give up, man. You smell like a freak! - What's up with you? Sit down! - I wouldn't even fuck a bitch like you. Go sit down! Go on, fuck off! Fucking pervert! Embarrassing, man! Hey, Julius! Fucking whores! Shut the fuck up! - I don't know him, okay? Get off with me if you want! - Fuck off! Suit yourself, putas! You scum! Suck my dick! Shut your mouth! - Come over here! Shut it! - Shut the fuck up! Fuck you and your dead, you godless motherfucker! You got that? Your mom is a whore! Fuck my dead, yeah? Screw you, boy! - Fuck you! Show your pussy! Real whores! One was pretty hot. Too bad. Where is the party at, Julius? This is like nowhere land. Fuck that shit, man! Now that I'm really in the mood... Let's check it out anyway. - No, let's get out of here. Please! If they search us I'm fucked, man. I've got a blade and mace. Why did you bring that shit, man? If you wanna get beat up again like last time, then fine. But I'm no loser. If anyone messes with us... - Dude! I hate being poor! Public transport sucks. Let's just take a bus. A taxi's way too expensive. Guys, I'll pay, okay? It was shit tonight. Total crap. You know why? 'cos we've got no money. If we had some money, we could've gone to a club. Then had some gas station vodka with the chicks from the bus, then Mickey D's and a good fuck. Not this shit. Can you turn on the radio? - I wanna hear Jam FM. Turn it up? Sure, Habibi. Please don't drink in here. I'll be careful. That'll be 12.30 euros, guys. - I'll get this. Wake up, we're home. Get out, bro. 12.30 euros, right? - Yes. Welcome to Neukölln, motherfucker! I told you I've got this, guys. You're sick. No women, no party... We gotta do something, guys. Hey? What about the school computers? We'll break in and steal them. Easy-peasy. Ten grand for each of us, just sitting there. That's like a year's income. - What the hell, guys? They'll fuck us over. - How can they? Think about it, Gino. What will your dad do when the cops take you home? Well... you can count me in. - Yeah, man! We'll do it without you if we have to, Lukas. 500 EUROS SON OF A WHORE What you looking at? Shut up. - You shut up, okay? Marco, he didn't do anything. Why the dumb look, then? - I have some good news. Look. My job contract. Here. Janitor. - Humboldt University! Yes! You finally made it to university, Dr. Matthias. Yes. Part time. I take home 800 after taxes. 800 euros? A month? 800 net. - I used to make that in a day. Except this is honest work. Congratulations. - How long would you work for 10,000? You're welcome to find a job too. Why do you ask? - No reason. Welcome to gym class. Today: Table tennis! Film it! Let me throw it! - You already threw it! Do you act like this at home? You've gone too far this time, guys. You little douchebag. He's bleeding! It's okay, I'll take the blame. You should see a doctor. - I want you all to leave the room. Go on, out! - Sorry, Mr. Saturday. Lukas! Why are you still here? I wanted to ask about doing my exams. Lukas, that's great. I've got something for you. I just wanted to ask how it works. I can help you register. That's no problem. What's up? What happened? It's nothing. Fuck it. Crazy. What's with his eye, dude? It was his fucking dad. Man, who took a dump here? Come in. Wait here. I need to talk to Gino a sec. About school and shit. Chill in the living room. Who are they? - My brother and his friends. Take off your shoes. - Seriously? This place is fucked up. Yeah, gross. Where are his parents? No idea. They took off ages ago. Hey, listen... Take off your fucking shoes. My brother mopped the floor. Take off your fucking shoes, or I'll stick your foot in his ass! Shoes off! Man! No respect! You're not at home here. Can't we just go to Julius' room? - What are they doing here in my flat? She doesn't like you. Giacco, Giacco, Giacco. Easy! What the hell is that animal? - No idea. Some weird kind of lizard. Let's go to Julius' room. Dude, Julius, don't you have any furniture? I've got something for you guys. What are these keys? Where's Gino? His fucking dad won't let him out. Keep your voice down! - Huh? What's up with you? I'll shout if I want to. You don't care how he's doing, right? Are you retarded, bro? Just shut the fuck up! Please! - There's no one around. No one cares. - I don't wanna get arrested. Fuck the cops. If anything happens, look what I got. It's my brother's gas pistol. You fucking crazy? - Check it out, it's awesome! Give that here, bro! - No way. Why are you like that? - Huh? Lukas is shitting it. Loco, I'm serious. Give it here, man. - No! Give it back, you retard! Retard? - You want to get caught? Take it easy! - Get your own gun! Give it back! - Shut up! Give me my gun! Give me my fucking gun! Shut up! Give him the gun, man! Watch out, I can't see you in the dark. You'll thank me, guys. - Go fuck yourself! This way, guys. Where? - To the left. Which way, Lukas? That's the staff room. Careful! - Julius, come on! Dude! - Hey! Turn that shit off, Julius! Chill, it's just for a second. For orientation. What the hell? Cover up, they might have cameras. Julius, turn the light off! Why? - 'cos you're dumb! Turn if off! What orientation? Now I can't see. - Julius, you fuck everything up. Wait for me. Where's the stuff, man? I cancelled a date for this! My chick's been a dancer for ten years. You know what a fine body she has? So many books, Loco! Who needs this many books? Fuck the books, man! Fuck you, man! You shit your pants! - Where are the fucking computers? Guys! Guys! Guys, here! I found them! Don't fuck with us, Lukas. Check it out! Holy shit! These are flat screens, man! - We hit the jackpot! Dude, what are you doing? - This is awesome! Put your address too, retard. I tell you, you're the most boring guys ever. And you're the dumbest, bro. Julius! - Got a better idea? I said we should go out the front. But you whine when I spray your school. Help me up. I'll climb over. You help Julius up, he throws them over, I'll catch them. It'll never work! It'll work. Sexy ass, Lukas! - Fuck you, man! You've got skid marks, man! Fucking gross! How long you had them on for? Then you push it. It's fucking hard work. Pushing that makes your ass even hotter. Give me that. The first thing I'm gonna buy is a sick chain, man. 150 grams minimum. And a fishing rod. For sure. - A fishing rod, Loco? What will you do with it? - Go fishing, bro! What'll you do with the cash? Come on! Hurry up! Come on! - Where did all these cars come from? What are you looking at? Let's cross! - Fuck off! Push, Lukas! - Take your shit someplace else, freaks! Fuck off, motherfuckers! What? - Shut the fuck up, asshole. What? - Shut the fuck up! Are you retarded? - Bro! I thought it was a gas pistol! Seriously, man? Every fucking time! What's wrong with you? Every time! Next time I'll hit you, faggots! Fuck off! Come on, Julius! Shit! Keep going! In there! Fuck! - Come on! Run! Come on. In here. Come on. Watch out for Giacco. Fucking kid. Give me the dirty underwear. - I'm not touching that shit! Then they won't touch the computers either. Throw the dirty clothes on top. If my brother finds them, we're dead. Don't you ever wash? - No machine. Julius, there are too many. I'll take one home, okay? Okay. - Turn around. Perfect. ... stole the computers. Expensive ones, and the screens too. Sit down! My seat's taken. - Then sit down there. The neighbors reported seeing three perpetrators. Male, young... And possibly armed. So if any of you hear anything... You can talk to us, okay? We don't bite. The damage is in the thousands. A real haul, huh? Shut up! I promise you this: We'll find them. And punish them. All of them. It's in your own interest. You want to learn on the computers. Yes, hello? - Hello. Who is this? - Who do you think? It's your brother. Are you dumb? You hid your number. Why not? Were you just at school? Yes, why? I heard some losers stole your computers. Yeah, the cops were here. - What losers! We would've done the same. But not nowadays. What's the difference? Those computers are registered, bro. They'll find them right away. Oh, okay. - They have numbers, like a tracker. You know who did it? - No idea. Sure, you don't. What a dumb move. Fucking losers. Anyway, I'll make some calls... Hang up! Hang up! Hang up! Right now! Welcome! How you doing? - What's up, Marek? Fuck your "What's up"! And you know why. You come in, eat your fucking kebab and play my slot machine with your greasy fucking fingers... When will I get my money? - Soon, I promise. Soon? Give me 10, 14 days and I'll pay. - What? I can't get it any quicker. Come out the front now! Take him! He's your buddy! Marek, chill. Put your hand on there! - Marek said to... Put your hand there! Don't make me shout. Calm down, Marek! - Just break his finger! Break his finger! Yes, and all you hear is... There's no point anymore! I worked for this school in my spare time. No one paid me for it! A problem school in Gropiusstadt. Violence, neglect, a predominantly migrant neigborhood. Many students live in poverty. Few of them own a computer. And now the school can no longer offer ITlessons. The new computers are gone, many destroyed. Lukas? Come here. - The thieves left a trail of destruction. - What's going on? What do you mean? - This. It's on all the news. ... the cellar of the Gropius School. It is not only the theft that has caused anger, but also the vandalism. Like it was perfect before? The school management assumes the thieves are their own students. Kids from your school! Vandalism, exhausted teachers, the police are powerless. ... high-quality computers have been stolen and we're looking for the culprits. This stuff happens there every day, and nobody cares! This is no biggie, and now you care? - No biggie? They were brand new computers. They cost a fortune! You could've finally learned something! But, no! Some idiots stole them! Did you hear what I said? This stuff happens every day. Constant fights, Turks bring knives to school... Turks... - Shouldn't that bother you? Spare me your gangster stuff, okay? I grew up here too, I know a thing or two. You don't! That was 100 years ago! You don't have to tell me all your old tips from 1970. Keep out of trouble. If a guy has a knife, keep out of it. You don't have a clue! You're stuck in your damn Katrin bubble! Karin! Her name is Karin! Can't you get that in your head? Fuck the fucking computers and fuck your Karin! Now you can fuck off, son. "Fuck off." - Fuck off! Always the same shit! - Fuck off! Why did someone hit you? Ask yourself! Why? Because I'm black. You know why? I'm a foreigner. An Arab. They think I'm like that, so I am. Why shouldn't I be a man? Should I study with him? Just look at him! Anyone could kick his ass! - Look at yourself, you wimp! Should I just sit there if they attack me? Should I say "hit me", just so my mom thinks she's right? Should I do that? And just get beaten up all the time? But... - Should they all attack me? My child... - And stomp on my head? Answer! Should they all stomp on me? Am I not a person? If you cut me, do I not bleed? So it's their fault. - It's all their fault. I have to go. I have to go. Are you fucking serious? - What? You're getting stoned? - Chill, Loco. We still owe them 500 euros! Relax. We have the computers. Then we'll give them to Djamel. - Never! Marco says they have codes. They're registered. You serious, Lukas? What if the cops raid my place? I gotta go. - Fuck you, man! You gotta go, huh? You need to help now. You weren't there at the break in. Believe me, the fucking Arabs hit harder than your dad! You bastard! What the fuck, man? - None of you fuckers are helping! Give me the computers. - Oh, yeah? And if I don't? - Chill out, man. Lukas, the computers are worth more. We'll sell them to the electronics shop on Sonnenallee. Desktops. Latest operating system. 1500 euros. - No. What? No? 1500 is a great price. We're being nice to you! - Let's go, man. I said it's pointless. - Then what would you give us? Hello? Say something, man! - Julius, dude! Show respect! That's fucking rude! At least look at 'em! Fuck off! Go, go, go! Bring those pigs back! Look out! Why'd you stop? He's right there. - Fuck it. Let's go. But he's right there! - Fuck it. We'll try again tomorrow. - No. The computers are registered. The cops might find them by then. - Bro... Ask your brother again. He's gotta know somebody. Same as ever, eh? Gropiusstadt is still standing. It's just as ugly too. At least it's summer. Now it's not just concrete. It's sun and concrete. Marco, where'd you get your money back then? Don't do anything dumb, okay? Look, the refugee! Where's my ten bucks? The whole crew. Don't you crooks got homes? You owe me 10 euros. - You'll get it, Ali. When? - You'll get it back! Keep it down up there! Get down! Come say hello. Quit grinning. Let him grin. He's like Cem, only girls on his mind. Cem! Cem! Who's your girl? Denise, bro. Denise. Fuck her, Denise, Menise. He's doing my nut in. Every day: Denise this, Denise that. If I hear that name again I'll go nuts. Little shit. I'll be right back, Ali. Who is that? Marek. He got 80,000 from my fucking slot machine. I'll call you back, bro. What's up? - What's up, Marek? How's your hand? - Great. This isn't a parking lot. Please move your vehicle. Get down from the roof right now! One by one! Do you maybe know where I could sell something? You fucking kidding? You dumb or something? Sell what? Grass? - No, just some stuff. Everyone off the roof! Off the roof! All of you! Please. Marco would never tell me. - What are you selling? Just stuff. For who? Yourself? - For a friend. Lukas, are you serious? A gold dealer? Quality goods, I have to say. Where did you get them? From my uncle. He works at an office supplier. They got sent more than they ordered. Do I look retarded? Do I look retarded to you? The computers were taken from this basement. Ifyou look closely... We're fortunate enough to be able to come in here... He said they're from his uncle, man! They're not the only computers in the world. How much did you want? - 1500. 1500! Are you nuts? For three stolen computers? They're not stolen! I'll make you a deal. 800 in cash. Otherwise, no dice. Is he fucking kidding? He'll pay 1000 easy. Let's ask for 1200. - He won't pay a cent more. 800 euros. 800! And another thing: I know your faces. You were never here. Got it? We've got five more. Want them too? Leave the computers and fuck off! Fuck off! Yeah, man! Hey, 800 euros for nothing! So much! - Let's bring it to Djamel. You can give him your share. But we split it. Everybody gets 200. Gino too. Gino wasn't even there! - He'd give it to you! Remember when your mom died? Who took care of you? Gino and his mom were there for you. - I know, man... And if the Arabs kill you, at least you'll be well dressed. It'll be fine. Fuck! - Let's go in. If we're not here today, it's super suspicious. Come on. Hey, Pablo Escobar! Tony Montana! Lukas? I've been looking for you, Lukas. Can you come with me to the counselor's office? I'd like to talk to you. Yeah? - It's me, bro. You sleeping? - What's up? Stop stuttering! You know that break-in? - Yeah, why? Talk, or I'll hang up. We did it. - Huh? What do you mean? Who did what? - We did it. We broke into the fucking school. Seriously? Seriously, Lukas? I told you, don't do anything dumb! - Hey, stop shouting. The whole school knows. Help me. What can I do? I'm standing outside the counselor's right now. Listen: no matter what he knows, don't say anything. And don't snitch. - Okay. I'll call you later. - Okay, bye. Everything okay? I'll give it to you straight: It's about the stolen computers. And about you. Yes... Coffee is a life saver. Do you drink coffee? - No. I can't function without it. Lukas, my keys were stolen when I was in your classroom. What do you have to say? I wanted... - I know. You don't have to say anything. I won't ask those Abduls for help. We both know it was those Ali Babas. But they won't talk. They stick together! We have to stick together too. It must drive you nuts. I know you're ashamed. You write great essays but then they laugh, so you don't dare anymore. I get that. This country is going to the dogs. Look at these photos. Who do you suspect? Anyone? No. If you hear anything, let me know. - Okay. You can come to me anytime. And Lukas... Watch your back. Matthias? - No, Lukas. Oh, we thought you'd be eating with us later. Oh well, sometimes it's gotta be pizza. How was school today? - It was okay. Fabian never tells me either. I remember my mom waiting for me at the door after school. "How was school?" So annoying! You're done with school soon. - I'm doing my exams. You've set yourself a big goal! I wanted to discuss something. Wouldn't it be nice to live with your brother? I'm not being mean. You could visit us any time. I live here, okay? And I'll stay as long as I want. It's too small for us four. - What do I care? It was fine the last few years before you came. So fuck off before I tell Matthias and he punches you! It was his suggestion. Did you get some money? Fuck! Mom? What's wrong, Mom? Did you find the new computer? Where did you get it? Me and the boys found it. Oh, you found it? Yes. - Where? You know, people leave trash on the sidewalk to be picked up? It's brand new! What else can I do? How about not stealing? Maybe go to school! Do your exams or something else! - Something else? Than stealing? Yes! - If I didn't steal, we'd have nothing! I wouldn't have these shoes. Or the stereo... Not even the flag! All the others have MP3 players and shit! What can I do, Sanchez? Work 24 hours a day? Let creeps grope me so you can get new sneakers? You want a prostitute for a mom? Huh? - No. No! I think we can manage without a stereo and sneakers. I'm sorry. Go and get your ID card. Why do you want me to get my ID? We're going to the police. Sanchez, I bust my ass here for you. Every damn day! And you just screw up. - No! You have no idea! Seriously, when was our last vacation? - Out! Get lost! I have nothing! - Out! I don't have shit! - Get out! I want you out of my sight! Go! Go! Get out! Go! Never, ever talk to me like that again! Go to your room! I want you out of my sight! - Mom! You can't just turn your back on me. If anyone's turned their back, it's you. You dad wants to say something. Karin thinks I should apologize. Lukas... I'm really sorry. I should've told you myself. The thing with Marco was just an idea. You know I care about you. And I know what you're going through. It was the same for me back then. Oh, man... - But you have to stay out of it. Smart guys give in. Smart guys hit back! You think I had it easy back then? I'm sick of hearing your fucking old stories! If you shout, you're wrong. What's going on? Drive! Shit! - Drive! Fuck you, man! Drive! At least that still works. All because you can't keep out of trouble. You're blaming me now? Look. That's my mom. Dude! What are you doing with my sister? I don't have the money. And I don't know which motherfucker stole... What's your problem? He's just a friend. - A friend? He's just a friend. Go back inside. Yallah, come up. Both of you come up. Come up here! Salaam alaikum! - Salaam. Go ahead. Why were you fighting? We weren't. He's my buddy. He stole my backpack. Did you really? Is that true? I don't know what backpack he means! No idea. What backpack? The red one. It's in the hallway. Sit down! Apologize to him. Yallah! You can't do that! Why should I? Go on. Apologize to him! Please! - Please say sorry! Do it, my son. I'm sorry. That's better. Will you leave me alone now? But don't come to the park ever again. Hey? You want peace? Yes, hello? Lukas! You have to get the shit out of here. It's a bad time... - What? Right now, got it? Seriously? - Yeah, man! Get that shit out of here! Get it out! Out! You tried to fuck me over, your own brother! You wanted to get me jailed and have the place for yourself. With your buddies, right? Thought you could fuck us over, eh? Can we take them to your place? - No. It's a bad time. Get this shit out of here before I kill Julius! Coming, Julius? - "Coming, Julius?" We cleared it all out. - Great. Okay, where's my gun? What gun? I'll ask again: Where's my gun? My gun, you fucker! Where is my gun? Give him the fucking gun, Lukas! Let him go! I see... Sit down, both of you. Sit down! Julius is coming with us! Well? - Sit down. Come on, Julius. Bye, you fat motherfucker. I'll lay it down, okay? You get your gun back, and I leave. And then we're good? Yes. Fucker! Hey, Marco. I made a few calls, bro. I know some guys who'll buy it all. I'll send you the address and you go straight there. Okay. - And you only talk to Abdul, got it? Nobody else. - Thanks. Thank me after I slap you for being a dumbass. Later. And? He'll send me the address. But we only talk to "Abdul", okay? Sure, I'll talk to Abdul for a few grand. Shut up! Shut your dumb mouth! Did you hear me? Shut it! Are you out of your mind? Hey, is that Abdul? - Are you kidding? Abdul? Are you Abdul? Let go of me! No, go away! Go away! What are you doing? - Gino! Come here! Are you Abdul? You got the money? What does he mean? - Back yard. That's all of it. - Where's the money? Hey! Man! Hey, man! Hey! What's going on? - Hey! Hey! That motherfucker! Where's Abdul? Where did he go? Where's Abdul? Abdul! The fat guy! With the beard! Where is he? Where are the computers? What's up? What's he saying? - Lukas, call Marco. Okay, okay. Go back in the kitchen! Your guy ripped us off! What do you mean? He ripped us off, the computers are gone. Don't bullshit me! Seriously? - Yeah. Why would I make it up? - Describe him. He was like a gangster. Tall... Bald with a beard. Abdul has long hair, man! How could you screw it up? I told you one thing: Talk to Abdul, and only to Abdul! No one else. Is that so hard? - I know! But what asshole rips off school kids? And you... - We all make mistakes, man. I'll call around, but I doubt I can help when you fuck it up so bad. At least the computers are finally gone. Got any charge left? - Why? My phone's empty. Can I put my SIM card in yours? Pin number? - Four times four. 4444? Yeah. - Seriously? Dude, you've got nine missed calls. What? It's ringing again. Hello? What's wrong? Blood everywhere... - What blood, dude? ... and ran off. Please! Yes, sure I will. Dude, what's up? What's with Gino? He hit his dad with a bottle and took off. What? Gino? Don't lie. - He jumped off the balcony. He would never do that. He would. - What do you mean? I need to talk to Gino a sec. Go chill in the living room. This is Tilidine. You did what? You gave him Tili? Are you retarded? I just wanted to help. Gino wanted to fight back, but he felt too inhibited. So I said I'd get him some Tili. It lowers your inhibitions. Take 20 drops, then wait 10 minutes. Then you knock your dad out and go to Italy with your mom. Are you brain dead? - You did nothing! Nothing at all! And now you're mad at me, now that it's all over? You call yourself a friend, but you punched him! Gino is my best friend. And I don't want his dad to beat his brains out! I swear, I hope his dad dies. I just wanted to help him. Do you believe that at least? Yo, guys! What's up? You guys okay? Lukas, come here. How's it going? You remember my dream girl, Denise? Denise? She's my girlfriend. Say hi. I finally found her! Why so shy? Come say hi. You blew me yesterday, now this? Are you sick? Are you sick? Who are you trying to fuck with! - Lukas! Little jerks! I'll kill you guys! Enough, man! - Get off me! Fuck off, assholes! That bitch played us, man! - What? Are you retarded? - We don't want any stress! Okay, I swear we can talk. We'll talk. We have other problems, okay? We'll talk? - I swore, okay? Get off me! Fucking assholes! I almost suffocated! You dog! I should have killed you all! I swear, Cem... - Shut it! I'll sort this! Fuck off! Want some? I'm done. HIGH-SCHOOL DIPLOMA You know what we'll do next? Our fucking school exams. Next stop: Klinikum Neukölln. I hate this hospital. This place isn't so bad. My mom died here. We're looking for Gino. We're his friends. I swear, I just wanted to help. Can I come in?
