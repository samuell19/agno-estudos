Mum, Luna's got my cap. - Go on, honey. Push, honey. - Give me my cap back ! Push. - Mum, Luna's got my cap. Cut it out. Enough, already ! Luna, give it back. Come on, Luna. Give it back. My cap... - Get dressed. We're late as it is. I cleaned your machine. That was quite a night. - You seem to be in a hurry. Yeah. My kids are coming. But I want to take a nap first. Are you okay, sweetie ? Come on, we're leaving. Otherwise we'll be late. Come on, darlings. We've got to go. Luna, don't forget your gym bag. Let's go. What are you doing today, Lisa ? Eva Young ? - Yes. Registered mail. - Do you need my signature again ? Mum, what is that ? - You can see what it is, sweetie. Another stupid letter, as always. Are you going to play with your friends ? - No. No ? What are you going to do ? - How's it going, Eva ? You had the night shift ? - Yes. The kids are coming later. Say hi to them from me. - 1 will. Do you feel like coming over for fish this weekend ? Okay, let me know when. - Okay, fine. I've got to go. I'm going to be late. - Bye, Jimmy. Go on. Aren't you going to give me a kiss ? Hang on, honey. Okay, go on. - Bye. Hey, Ms Young. Have you got a moment ? How are things, Ms Young ? Doing okay ? What about Lucas ? So, he can join us on the class trip ? That's good. Could it be that you haven't paid yet ? No, I paid it yesterday. I've got to go now. Bye. Jimmy, are you having your period ? - No, it's for Alexia. She came from the loo and then said: Daddy, I'm bleeding. So it's started ? - Yes, the moment has arrived. What did you tell her ? -What can I tell her ? Poor child. That she's a grown woman now. Here, take this one. - All right. 16.90 euros, please. - On my card. Go ahead. Your card was declined. - Can I try again ? Sure. Put it in again. How can that be ? - Here. Pay me back sometime. Thank you. Thank you. Hi Laslo. Don't you have school today ? - No, it's a teacher work day. You're lucky, again. - Yeah. What the hell ? Look what you're doing. Are you blind ? My shoes and my trousers are soaked. Who's going to pay for this ? Hey, take it easy! It wasn't on purpose. - These shoes cost 200 euros. Are you going to pay for this ? - At least they're clean now. Get out of here, arsehole. - Get lost. You ought to go to cleaning school. - Get out of here. It's Eva. - Come on in. Philomene, I brought the groceries. They were out of regular butter. That's all right. I can spread it, too. Thank you. What do I owe you ? - It was sixteen euros and change. Keep the change. - Thanks, you're so sweet. Well ? What's wrong ? Hi. Could it be that my unemployment benefit wasn't deposited ? This is Eva Young. Tomorrow ? Okay, thank you. Luna, what's this ? You didn't have your gym clothes ? Luna, go and get your gym clothes. Luna, Mum is talking to you. Go and get your gym bag. Mum, these... Mum, they're too big. - Then you've got space for your toes. Do you like them ? - Yes. Hello. Thank you. You're looking for a saleswoman ? - Are you interested ? It's for the weekend. No, too bad. The kids are with me then. - Pity. That will be 29.90 euros, please. Here you go. - Thank you very much. Are you happy ? - Yes. Breathe in and out calmly. Then take a deep breath. Blow hard. Keep blowing... Okay. Well done. That's great. You may stop and come out of the booth. Let's see. There, that all looks very good. Can I go on our class trip ? - Well, it looks fine to me. But you mustn't forget your inhaler. Who is it ? - You can't see. I want light, honey. Again. - Again ? Hello. Ms Eva Young ? - Yes. Bailiff. You know why I'm here ? - No. May we come in ? - Not now. The kids are home. Madam, don't be difficult. He's just doing his job. The children won't even notice. It won't take long. What do you say ? Go on. - All right. Yes, all right. Mum, who is that man ? - He's writing down all the stuf we own. Why ? If something is stolen, he'll get it back. Will you write down the PlayStation ? - He certainly won't forget that. Let the man do his job. - Look, sir. What do you think ? Lisa is the one sitting on the dog. That's Lucas. That's me. You like it ? WARRANT OF EXECUTION It's lovely, dear. All right, there we go. Come with me for a moment. Madam, you've got 4,732 euros in outstanding debts. I suggest you try to pay it back as soon as possible. All right, have a nice day. Right, that was that. Look, it's not easy. - This is the third time already. I've made note of all of it. - See you next time. You wanna hear a joke ? - Yes. Well, a boy was taking a bath... I know a joke too. Wanna hear it? - No. Dinner's ready, children. Careful, it's hot. Don't burn yourself. Thank you. A fish for Eva. Alexia. Your plate. Look daddy, that's a potato I peeled. - It looks like one by Picasso. All right, don't make a mess. Bon app√©tit and don't choke. Is it tasty ? I'm not so hungry. I'm going to put the little one to bed. All right. Are you smoking again ? Look, it's none of my business, but I saw that you had some visitors. If you want, you can leave everything at my place. They can't touch it there. It's no use, Jimmy. They inventoried everything. And what should I tell the children ? Look. That woman helped me out a lot, before. You should give her a call. You know you're not in this alone. I'll run a copy of this. Have you got others ? How many do you want ? Mostly hospital bills. I'll see what I can do. But I do see that it's a large sum. It may have to be a collective DMP. That means we would manage your budget. So, you'll decide what I can buy ? Yes and no. You'll get a weekly or monthly allowance. But we may veto purchases that we find unacceptable. But the committee decides. I'll pass everything on to them. Within a week I should hear from them and then I'll contact you. Then you can come by and we'll start the ball rolling. I don't like the idea. Thank you for your time. Hi, honey. How are you ? - Fine. Eva, I've got a load of laundry, if you'd like to do it ? Here. Be careful, because my sweaters shrank. I haven't got much to wear anymore. You didn't gain weight ? - I've lost three kilos due to stress. Sir, are you out of detergent ? - Yes. You can use mine if you want. - Thank you. Hello, are you still looking for a saleswoman ? For the weekend ? Okay. We went to Paris this weekend. Eurodisney. It was so nice. I took pictures. I'll show you a few. That's the entrance. Nice, isn't it ? - Yes. And this is the big slide. And that's the parade in the evening. It's lovely, really. That's the hotel. This is where we slept. Really ? - Yes. But it was expensive. Anything for your children. - True. We've already done that. But not in Paris. We went to Florida. That's nice too. Mum, we've never been to Disneyland. Yes, we have. You were little. You don't remember. Mum, look. That man who came by yesterday. Hello, sir. Quiet, he can't hear us. What's he doing ? - He's working. Can't you see that ? Come on, let's go. There's macaroni in the freezer. Don't forget. Cheese yoghurt. This is my number. Call me if you need me. What's in it for me ? - My respect, that's what. Kids ? - Yes? Mum is off to work. See you later. Be good. And listen to Laslo. - We will. Have you got these in white ? - No, I've only got these in white. And the ones under them, as well. - Two sizes larger ? No. - What should I do ? Could you ask your manager whether there's anything... One moment, madam. Hello ? Get his inhaler out of the cabinet. All right, I'm coming. God damn it. Well, where are you going? Take a deep breath, honey. What did you do ? - He just started hyperventilating. Fuck. Mum, where are we going ? To the euro store. - What's that ? A shop where you can get as much as you want, for only one euro. What's going on here ? Eva isn't here. - Calm down. Calm down, sir. - What's going on ? The bailiff is doing his job. - She'll be home tonight. She's got children. Eva, pick up, God damn it. It's Jimmy. If you get this, call me back. It's urgent. Mum, this isn't a real shop, is it ? It's all right, Mum. Be good and have fun. I don't want any complaints. Here's your inhaler. Be sure to take it, honey. Have fun. I love you. And now for the two sofas, the lovely sofas to my left. Bidding will start at ten euros. Anyone ? Ten euros ? Anyone ? Nobody ? Eight euros, anyone ? Nobody ? Five euros, anyone ? Five euros for you, madam. Now for the PlayStation. With six games. Who will bid two euros ? Two euros down in the front. Going once, going twice. Two euros. For this gentleman. For this lovely flat screen, 20 euros. Ten euros ? Anyone ? Ten euros for this lady. A nice laptop, 20 euros. Anyone? 20 euros ? Fifteen euros, anyone ? Ten euros, anyone ? Ten euros for this lady. It's yours, madam. Two euros. Going once, going twice. Two euros, madam. One euro, anyone ? Here in the front. One euro in the front. Mum, the door is open. - Wait, Mum is going to check it out. Luna, wait with your sister. Mum is going to check it out. Well ? What do you think ? - How did you do this ? I wasn't alone. All the others are here too. It's so cosy here. Eva, it's so cosy here. Wow, such lovely furniture you've got. - Very nice. What's going on, Mum ? Come here, honey. - Your mum has got a lovely flat. Hey, your scooter's just outside. - No way. It certainly is. Jimmy, thank you for everything. You lot too. Thank you so much. - We were happy to do it. You were supposed to lie down. I'm going up quickly. What are you going to do now ? I'm meeting with the welfare office again. I've got too much debt. Lucas needs to see the doctor again soon. I just don't know anymore. - I bet. Things like that add up. And the job in that shoe shop ? No, not with all those snobs. - Right, that's not your thing. You'll be all right, won't you ? - I'll get by, Jimmy. Of course. Shall we go ? - Yes. Alexia and Leona, we're leaving.
