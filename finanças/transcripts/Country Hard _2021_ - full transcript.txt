I'm hanging in there My shock absorbers are bad, so they're repairing them Oh! Ben, how about the Visa application program you informed me about? The program is on, I already told you, it requires money to get involved. Is it legit? One hundred percent. Both my youngers brothers' left the country with those Visas. Have you forgotten? Ben, I've able to raise half of the funds. If you could help me get the Visa sorted, When I travel out of the country I will reimburse you. Ochuko, if you can't cover the total fee, then there's nothing I can do. I hope you understand. Nothing I can do And you know there's a time limit. It expires. Didn't you know? There's just two weeks left. In two weeks the program shuts down. It'll be next year before the program starts up again. So That's the way things are What troubling you? Nothing really, I'm just thinking What are you thinking about? Nothing, it's just about a lady I ran into earlier today What about her? It's not important, Ben Was she pretty? Did you ask her on date? Erm... Its pretty straightforward. The program is on, you just need to get the money If you can raise the cash I'll handle the rest. Its no big deal Ochuko, if there's anything you can do to raise the cash then now is the time to do so. Remember the visa program shuts down in two weeks. Until next year.
