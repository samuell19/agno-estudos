Moral and Civic Education ﻿You talk too much. ﻿Let's play the game. ﻿I won! ﻿I'm telling you, I lack the head of ﻿Gen. Geisel for completing my album. ﻿I doubt. I only know two ﻿kids who completed that album. ﻿I won, loser. ﻿Loser?... You are lost. ﻿I won! ﻿Again? ﻿I've won twelve. You quit or what? ﻿Play the game. ﻿Are you gonna cry, loser? ﻿Hum... think you're afraid. ﻿- You'll lose. - ﻿Barriga is afraid. ﻿You owe me fifteen stickers. I don't want torn stickers. ﻿Come on, pay him the stickers. ﻿I can't believe I won. I started the game with no stickers. ﻿What did you say? ﻿What's wrong? I won playing the game. ﻿Give them all back to me. You're cheating. - W﻿hy? - A fine. ﻿You can't play the game without any stickers. You have to pay fifteen. ﻿You did not created a rule before we started. ﻿Come on, give my fifteen ﻿stickers back. I want them Now! ﻿I'll give you five. ﻿I said fifteen, didn't you ﻿hear me? ﻿What if I don't give tnem to you? A fight! ﻿I want to see blood! ﻿﻿Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! ﻿The Bacalhaus are here! ﻿Stop it. Wanna fight? Cool. But here we have rules. ﻿We're the class of Rui Barbosa! ﻿The man, spits here. ﻿The real man steps on here. ﻿Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! ﻿Ih, Ze Luiz is the wife of Beto! ﻿He is a Lady. He is a Lady. ﻿The bell rang twice. Everybody go to classroom, hurry up. Go. ﻿Beto, why didn't you face him? - ﻿Because my Dad would find out I was in a game. - Who as going to tell?! ﻿The Director! I can't believe you Ze. ﻿...the devil has his tools. That's why Jesus said: ﻿"What is the point to gain ﻿the world and lose your soul" ? ﻿And with these words I enclose this sermon, I invite you all.. ﻿You were playing in the meeting? How many times have I told you? ﻿Brother. Brother Lazaro! ﻿How are you? ﻿I am doing fine. ﻿I bought all the material, when can you paint my house? ﻿- Did you buy impermeable fluid? - The imperm...? ﻿Yes, we bought. The one in the yellow can. ﻿Oh, right! If it wasn't for this woman in my life. What would I do? ﻿Behind every great man, there's a great woman! ﻿Beside, sister, beside. ﻿Sister Maria, Jacira is beside, behind, in front, right sweetheart? ﻿I can't wait to see our house painted, with that smell of something new. ﻿Listen brother, if you need anything you can ask me I am home all day. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Thank you brother. ﻿Hey you up there? Are you ok? ﻿My ear is burning. ﻿You never learn, huh? ﻿I was about to beat my record, Rosa, ﻿five days without being punished. ﻿But you didn't see the meeting was over? ﻿What's wrong play a little bit? ﻿I was winning... ﻿And besides, the only thing ﻿I do well is to play sticker. ﻿But you don't play soccer? ﻿Yes I do, but I am always chosen last. ﻿Maria after we came to this house ﻿things started getting better, huh? ﻿And when will we have peace? ﻿We'll get better Maria. Believe me. ﻿You will se me with fourteen painters all working for me ﻿And then we will have much more money ... ﻿I've heard that before. As you start making money, starts the debts too. ﻿I never seen it. We have to do savings! ﻿Save money how? The money I make hardly cover our expenses. ﻿It's like my father used to say: ﻿if we have fourteen jobs, we'll have fifteen necessities! ﻿You eat like a chick and ﻿shit like a duck! ﻿I eat like a chick? ﻿Rosa, see if Ismael peed in the bed and change him. - ﻿Bye son. - Bye dad. ﻿Clean the house, Rosa. ﻿Aren't you going to school today, Rosa? ﻿Today is school holiday, pisser. ﻿In the house of Mrs. Leonor ﻿they have butter. ﻿But here is not the home of Mrs. Leonor. ﻿Put fat, it's the same thing. The ﻿important thing is not to stay behind. ﻿Right Rosa? ﻿Let's play with them!? ﻿Play? We're going to have fun, Ismael. ﻿But isin't it the same thing? ﻿Of course not, having fun is much better! ﻿What is that noise? ﻿Noise of cans! ﻿Beto, you forgotten? Today is the game against Barriga's team. ﻿At least, today, the game doesn't start without me. ﻿It is not going to be easy. Barriga's team is tough. ﻿They are organized. They will buy uniforms, a new ball... ﻿That is why we must also b﻿egin to get organized. ﻿Why don't we start a club? ﻿Good Ideia! ﻿Ah, I know, how about "Cebolinha Club"! I ﻿already saw that cartoon stuff on tv. ﻿ ﻿How about "The Champions of Ivai Street?" ﻿No way!... Barriga's team also lives on Ivai Street. ﻿But they live in the end of the street and they don't have kichutes. ﻿Those fleabags play barefoot. ﻿But not us! We use kichute! ﻿Yes! " The Boys in Kichute" ﻿Beto, so now just you are having fun, how about me? ﻿You are milk-tooth, little brother. ﻿Lets go. Lets go. ﻿Bye Ismael. ﻿I know. Whom scores first, becomes president! Really? .. ﻿and goalkeeper is out? ﻿You have to score too. ﻿You can score from ﻿goal kick. ﻿It's not fair. Not even your father scored ﻿from goal kick. ﻿Catch penalty kick is worth a score, then? ﻿So be the goalkeeper, ﻿hot shot. ﻿See you later alligator. ﻿After a while crocodile. ﻿We thought the ﻿sissies wouldn't come? ﻿Look at this retarded. You broug﻿ht the stickers? ﻿Here. ﻿Four time score, we change ﻿sides, eight ends the game. ﻿Two time score, we change sides. We play with no shirts on. Let's go team. ﻿We start with the ball. ﻿Beto! Get out of the game. ﻿Hey Beto? It seems you are killing cockroach... ﻿- Edvaldo! Get home now! - I'll have to go. ﻿- Put someone in his place. - The phantom of the bagger that died here? ﻿It is not safe evoke spirit ﻿from another world. So what? You afraid. ﻿You don't get afraid? Huh, me? No, I don't. ﻿Lets' penalty kick. Lets decide the game by penaltys. ﻿That is it, captain! ﻿One, two, three, four, five, six... ﻿I'll run over the goalkeeper. ﻿Huh? I am not the keeper anymore. ﻿Why not Silvahir? ﻿They'll kick hard, if the ball hits in my face, mother kills me. ﻿Mothers aren't easy. ﻿What do we do now? ﻿You shit in your hands ﻿and play if away. ﻿I will be the goalkeeper. ﻿Beto? He's not even able to catch a cold. ﻿Go. Hurry your Kick. ﻿That kid plays soccer well, huh? ﻿If the game ties, the victory is ours. ﻿If you score, you win. If I ﻿catch, the victory is ours. ﻿Silvanir! Want to go back as goalkeeper? ﻿No one is gonna catch. ﻿I am the goalkeeper now! ﻿Get ready, Goalkeeper?!... Watch your nose! ﻿Pilico, lay out your toe. Give a hot kick! ﻿Pilico, you faggot! ﻿The other day, he kicked a ball like a professional. ﻿My father! ﻿When the boys play again? Tomorrow they come again, ﻿and the day after. ﻿They come they every single day in the afternoon. ﻿They don't come in the morning because they are at school. ﻿Investors want to boy everything here. ﻿Why sell? Everyone is happy here, Luizinho. ﻿We have what we need to live well. ﻿I just need my music, my friends and rum to get hot! ﻿You took the medicine? ﻿What for? Let it go, Luizinho. I have heart of a child's. ﻿Huh?! ﻿Our class of Moral and Civic Education ﻿will be on today's professions. ﻿I want to know what the father of each one of you does. ﻿For the next class, I want an essay on ﻿what each one of you wants to be ﻿when you grow up. ﻿It is with the work of each one of you that we build a great BRA... ﻿...ZIL! ﻿Valquria! ﻿My father is a nurse. ﻿Great. Ze Luiz? ﻿My father is businessman. ﻿Aroldinho! ﻿My mother is a secretary. ﻿Teacher? Can I go to restroom? ﻿No Edivaldo. You've just come ﻿back from break! Silvanir? ﻿My father has a butcher shop. ﻿Nelson! ﻿My father is a bus driver. ﻿- Roberto! - My father is a painter. His father is the brother of Teroba! ﻿Teroba's Brother? ﻿Who is Teroba? ﻿Silence! I don't want anyone ﻿mocking a classmate. ﻿There is no discrimination here. We are all Brazil! ﻿...lians! ﻿- Cleide! - My father is a bricklayer. ﻿- Hiroshi! - My father works in the bank. ﻿- Claudio? - My father is military! ﻿Each one of you should take pride in the profession of your father ﻿Then design your own profile ﻿which may be the same as your parents or find your own profession. ﻿This is the task for the next class. ﻿Dna Terezinha? Edivaldo did pee here. It did wet my tennis shoes. Edivaldo, ﻿how many times, I have to repeat: if you need to go to the restroom, just ask! ﻿Hi sweetie! You're here? ﻿What will you be when you grow up? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Isn't it weird? "What will you be when you grow up?" You already are, No? ﻿You are funny. ﻿Everything is funny when ﻿it isn't with us, Beto! ﻿Go to Tanaka's store and purchase a pound of coffee and a bottle of rum. ﻿Why do I have to hide the bottle? ﻿Because people don't have to ﻿to know everything about our lives! Got it? ﻿Today is saturday, Luizinho is asleep. Take this coin, it is for you. ﻿You don't have to. ﻿Stop being silly. You need to buy your stickers. ﻿Beto. - ﻿Don't let anyone see it. - The stickers? ﻿The bottle, Beto. ﻿Beto, are you going to buy cachaça to Mrs. Leonor? ﻿It is none of your business. - I am going with you. - Ok. ﻿Will you keep the ball, goalkeeper? ﻿Sonia, throw the ball. ﻿Give me two packs of stickers. ﻿Of album Brazil Beloved Fatherland! ﻿Ah, very well. ﻿Take the money Mr. Tanaka. ﻿I'll take the pack of coffee. ﻿Look the retards, Pilico, ﻿invading our territory! ﻿You are! Come from the end of the street to do what here? ﻿You are full of it, huh? ﻿I want to see you playing soccer! ﻿I can handle ten like you! Hey Kids, come here. Everybody come here. Listen, my name ﻿is Jaide, but everyone in the club knows me by Xaveco. ﻿I am the Nacional Atletico ﻿Club talent hunter. ﻿I've already discovered some players ﻿for the national soccer team. ﻿After the state championship ends, ﻿we'll test boys for the youth team. ﻿You boy here and you too, you ﻿play well enough to pass. ﻿Boy, if you want to be goalkeeper, this is your chance. You have Style! ﻿And it will have room for all three? ﻿We have room for whom plays soccer well. ﻿Did you hear it, japanese boy? ﻿Let me go now, it's late. Go back to play. ﻿You believe him? ﻿And if he is like Robertao? ﻿Robertao is a crook. ﻿Pardal already played in the team of Robertao. ﻿- Your mother. - Yours. ﻿I know a kid who did a test on the team of Robertao. ﻿Passed? ﻿He passed a week without ﻿being able to sit down! ﻿Don't run Ze Luiz. Hey ﻿dad, did you buy my soccer schoes? ﻿They are with Sonia, kid. You ﻿better score now croocked foot. ﻿Dad, I was born stricker. ﻿Kid, in my time, I did score goals with my barefoot toe. ﻿I was known as the goat's foot. ﻿Used to score from goal kick. ﻿Hi. How's it going? ﻿- Bought the lemon? - ﻿Yes. ﻿Hurry up. I am starving. ﻿Beto, you going to ﻿Saint John's party? ﻿My father doesn't allow. ﻿Why? ﻿Because in my church, Saint John's party, children's day and birthday party aren't allowed. ﻿Sonia, my daughter. Each person lives his own way ﻿we have nothing to do with it. Right Beto? ﻿But I think you are at the age to get out and dance, enjoy music. Don't you think? ﻿Let's go Sonia. ﻿Hurry up, I am standing here like a hungry lion! ﻿Beto, look at this ﻿soccer shoes that I won. ﻿Nice soccer shoes! Now you just ﻿need new shorts to match! ﻿What for? This one is not good. ﻿Ze Luiz, why you wear cheap shorts? ﻿My mother made it for me. ﻿Beto, you are going for the test ﻿at Nacional Club, right? ﻿Huh, the soccer test? ﻿You are going, right? ﻿I think not. ﻿I think not? You are crazy, Beto? This is your chance! ﻿Remember what Xaveco said: "You have style!" Talk to your father. ﻿No way! I won't raise a child to become a keeper. ﻿Soccer players end up in misery! ﻿Think of Garrincha. ﻿And Pele...? ﻿Pele isn't a keeper! ﻿Garrincha neither. ﻿Some goalkeeper became rich! ﻿Since when you understand about soccer? ﻿Just assume, Beto. You get hurt practicing at this club. ﻿And then they ﻿bring you home crippled. ﻿Who is going to feed you? ﻿Will they put food in your mouth? ﻿Painting walls is also risky. ﻿Is it sin that he has a dream? ﻿My daughter, it's not a good dream! Even the Bible doesn't approve it. ﻿Bible forbids to be a goalkeeper? ﻿Did they have any soccer in the time of the Bible? ﻿Of course not! ﻿Beto. In Galatians 5:26 says: ﻿"Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another". ﻿Soccer is competition. God is against competition. ﻿To God everyone is equal, to God there is not a champion. ﻿If is time for you to choose. Who do you prefer: God or the world? ﻿God. ﻿So I don't want to hear about it, and if I hear it again, you will be whipped. ﻿Are we clear? ﻿There's more, Maria, from tomorrow, this kid is going to work with me. ﻿Soccer Player?.... It gives no future. Maria, give me a cup of coffee. ﻿In our last lesson, I asked you to d﻿o an essay on the theme ﻿"What I want to be when I grow up?" Has Everybody done it? ﻿Me did not do it. "I" did not do it! And why didn't you? ﻿"I" didn't do it because I dont know what I want to be when I grow up. He will ﻿be a drunk, as his father is! ﻿Silence! ﻿Go to the punishment facing the wall, now! ﻿Valquiria? ﻿I want to be a doctor who ﻿takes care of the heart. ﻿They have many challenges and earn lots of money. ﻿If I don't become a doctor, I want to be a singer or a dancer. ﻿Very good, Valquiria. Roberto, read your writing. Me? ﻿Have we another Roberto here? ﻿- I didn't do it. - Make something up. ﻿What's happening back there? Read your writing! ﻿What I want to be when I grow up. Like Uncle Teroba! ﻿Silence! Claudio go to Dean's office, now! Aroldo make sure He goes there. ﻿Roberto continue your reading. ﻿My father is a painter. I don't know why but sometimes it seems that he likes it ﻿and I also want to do something that like ﻿and what I most like to do is play soccer, so I want to become a goalkeeper. ﻿Very well! So you want to be ﻿goalkeeper when you grow up? ﻿I want to be goalkeeper now! ﻿When I grow up I want to be the Brazilian National Team goalkeeper! ﻿It is good to know that you have a dream. ﻿Teacher. What you wanted to be when you grew up? ﻿Me? I... want...well... ﻿Can I go to the bathroom? - ﻿Go Edivaldo! - Yes. Sandro? ﻿My father is a bricklayer, but when I grow up I want to be a famous astronaut ﻿I will travel to space and will step in the... at the... ﻿... on the moon. ﻿I don't understand my own writing. Beto, you know what I think about leaving food on the plate. ﻿Why you are not eating? ﻿He might be with worms. ﻿Worm! ﻿He lacks punishment. ﻿My stomach hurts. ﻿Maria, bring me a c﻿up of water, please. ﻿And you stop whining. ﻿Table is a place to eat. ﻿You want to groan, go to bed! ﻿You don't have fever, but better buy you a purge. ﻿I know. Just talk about work and the kid gets sick. ﻿I don't know whose inheritance is it. ﻿You'll stay at home, but if know you went out, I'll whip you! ﻿Are we understood, Beto? ﻿Yes Sir. ﻿Drop me off at the church, I planned to do Bible study. ﻿Lets go. I am already late. ﻿Are you feeling better? ﻿I think so. ﻿Beto, you are burning in fever. ﻿Give him purge. ﻿Maria, can you get my blue shirt, please? ﻿Are you going out? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Where to? ﻿Go to work! Huh? ﻿And you have to put a new shirt to go work? ﻿If I need not, why would I ask? ﻿Ok, I'm not the boss here, anyway. ﻿Rosa, you think that one day ﻿we will go to a party? ﻿Uncle Rogerio said that If I want, he leads me on his birthday party. ﻿When I become professional keeper, ﻿you'll have a big party, you'll see. ﻿But father said, it's not for you to think about it anymore! He beats you. ﻿Father said. If I'm like him, I will spend ﻿the rest of my life just watching ﻿while others have fun. ﻿So stop only watching... ﻿I hate gossip, Lazaro, but ﻿there is a rumor in the city, ﻿they are talking so that you and the wife of Alcione... ﻿There is talking, huh? ﻿Yeap. ﻿People talk too much, Agenor, talk too much! ﻿Hey old rooster! ﻿- Good evening. - Good evening, Lazaro. ﻿Why are you so late? ﻿Maria, I was with Agenor, ﻿you can ask him. ﻿Let me know you visit that bitch, ﻿I'll kill you! You know me! ﻿I'm working so we have a better life. ﻿Alcione gave me a few contacts, I'm looking for more painters. ﻿Take the opportunity and put another painter to finish the house of Jacira. ﻿I applied for that government housing plan. They are going to deliver soon. ﻿It's far, but will be ours. ﻿And then, if by chance I'm gone, you and the children will have a place. ﻿Get away from me! ﻿Ah, Maria. ﻿Get away from me because I can't. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Dad will earn more money! ﻿Dream on... It is free. ﻿It's not time to be awake! I don't want any more talking. ﻿Piu, piu, piu... ﻿Can someone go get the Ball? ﻿You go get it. You are the goalkeeper! ﻿Are you afraid? ﻿I'll help you, Beto. ﻿Hey guys, I am attacking him. ﻿Ah you develish kid! Are you here again? ﻿If you break my window once again, I'm going to tell to your father. ﻿Little piece of shit. You were playing soccer, huh? ﻿Me? Just a little bit. ﻿Beto, why do you insist doing that? ﻿Before, I was a nobody in the Field. ﻿Now, they choose me first. ﻿Why do you want to be number one? ﻿Do you like being the number two? ﻿Go to Tanaka's store and buy some peanuts for your mother. ﻿Look. ﻿Gigarrets with filter are twenty, without ﻿is ten. Naked woman cards only here. ﻿Look that hairy stuff, dude! ﻿Hey, give me three cigarrets. ﻿How about that sex magazine? ﻿I am hunting for it. I'ts going to cost you lots of Money. ﻿It doesn't matter. ﻿Mrs Florinda is coming, be carefull. ﻿What's happening here? ﻿If I get you boys bringing that again, ﻿I'm taking you to the dean's Office ﻿Did you uderstand me? O﻿h breed with no custom. ﻿And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: ﻿of the tribe of Reuben; ﻿Elizur the son of Shedeur. ﻿Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. ﻿Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab. ﻿Amminadab. ...﻿the son of Amminadab, Of Issachar: Nethaneel the son of Zuar. ﻿Ok. ok.

He's got eighty in the math test. ﻿Oh Yeah? ﻿Dad, you promissed to let me go to the movies if I did well in the test. ﻿- Did I say that? - Yes, you did. ﻿And how much does that crap cost? ﻿Only two for the matinee. ﻿And what kind of movie is showing? ﻿It's a film for kids. ﻿I want to go too! ﻿Yeah? Did you get eighty in the test? ﻿No, but if I went to your school, I would get two hundred. ﻿See? ﻿I remember I wanted a new dress, but never told her, we were very poor. ﻿But I saw those girls the parties dressed beautifully ﻿It wasn't Christmas, birthday, nothing, and my mom bought me a new dress ﻿Beautifull, the most beautifull dress I ever got. ﻿The funny thing is. She felt happier than I did. ﻿It seemed that ﻿she had won the dress. ﻿It feels good to give. ﻿Someday He is going to ﻿get in real trouble ﻿That not even his father is going to be able to help him. ﻿Hey you two. Go way back there and get on line. ﻿Tomorrow we are going to the car ﻿junk yard, Gamba is meeting us there. ﻿Yes. it's going to be a good deal. ﻿Netherlands was the opponent team Brazil most feared. ﻿Barely started the game and kepeer Leao already saved a ball. ﻿Brazilian fans could see that the players were feeling the responsability of the game. ﻿Mister Roberto, how ﻿are you doing at school? ﻿I am doing well. ﻿Are you learning much things? ﻿Yes, sir. ﻿Like this calendar!

Mom. ﻿Hey Beto, have you forgot? We have meeting at the car junk yard, today. ﻿I forgot about it, but I'll be thefe. ﻿See you there. ﻿No more oil.

You pervert! What're you ﻿thinking, huh? ﻿Where is Beto? ﻿Stupid boy! ﻿It's not my fault. He was running too fast. I couldn't stop. ﻿I saw him. He passed in front of my house running. ﻿Do you think he is dead? He is ﻿breathing. ﻿Bad weed the frost doesn't kill. What's your name boy? ﻿Where's my new kichute? ﻿His name is Beto. He's the son of the painter at Ivai street. ﻿I know his family. I will tell them. ﻿I'm taking him to the local hospital. ﻿I can't handle it anymore. The boy crossed all the limits in this house. ﻿He put his sister in risk because of that stupid game ﻿And he will put the family in risk because he is obsessed for that damn thing. ﻿Maria. ﻿Hi there! ﻿Yes? ﻿Are you Beto's father? ﻿What did he do now? ﻿He was hit by my car. ﻿He was what? ﻿He was running too fast. I couldn't stop the car. I﻿t was a very delicate fracture. ﻿We have to wait about three weeks to see the calcification development. ﻿He's lucky, if we can call it lucky. ﻿But is he ok? Is there any risk? ﻿You can calm down. He's young. He will be fine. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Mom, Beto is awake. How are you doing my son? Where is my kichute? ﻿They are over there, Beto. ﻿See, I can't be a goalkeeper anymore. ﻿God wanted it to be that way, right? ﻿No son. ﻿God does not punish people. ﻿Yes he does. ﻿He knows I lied. ﻿I lie when I need. ﻿I know. ﻿Now it's the way you wanted. ﻿I will never play soccer again ﻿Not even be a helper. ﻿To become a soccer player can be risky. ﻿Things can go wrong... ﻿You have to play against very good players. ﻿But I am good! ﻿You don't believe it. ﻿Of course I do. ﻿But now we have to ﻿help you to get well. ﻿Then everything will find it's place, right? ﻿Yes. ﻿We have to leave. ﻿Because you are here on welfare, you can't have companion overnight. ﻿It seems you are not going to be alone. ﻿If you need anything, you turn on this light that the nurse will come. ﻿Dad... ... ﻿I'm afraid. ﻿I'm going to confess you a secret son. ﻿I have fear too. ﻿I have fear for many things. ﻿Fear is a feeling ﻿I know way too well. ﻿Now you need to ﻿have faith in God, son. ﻿He knows what to do. ﻿He acts when you expect less. ﻿God talks to us all day long, we have to know how to listen... ﻿...and we have to be patient. ﻿There is a time for everything. ﻿You have to go now. ﻿Good night, son. ﻿Good night, mom. ﻿Sleep well, ok? ﻿May God stay with you, son. ﻿Bye. ﻿There was a cockroach inside your album ﻿then I put it inside a plastic bag. ﻿The cockroach? ﻿The album, Beto. ﻿What are you looking at, brat? ﻿How do you know I'm looking at you? ﻿I see you looking at me. ﻿Then you are looking at me too. What happened to you? ﻿I was hit by a car. How about you? ﻿So did I... by life. ﻿And I was by a car. Are you afraid? ﻿Yes... I'm afraid if I won't play ﻿soccer anymore. ﻿In what position do you play? ﻿I'm a goal keeper. ﻿A keeper? Look a﻿t that. ﻿I used to be a goal keeper too. ﻿I played at Londrina, Vitoria, and Juventus! It was fun time. I earned a lot of money. I bought two new cars. ﻿A red karmanghia and a black dodge dart. A karmanghia and a dodge dart? Then you like to play as a goal keeper? ﻿Yes... but sometimes I fear the penalty kicks. ﻿Fear? ﻿But I like it. What's your name? Beto. ﻿Name of goalkeeper. ﻿Beto. ﻿There are two kinds of people: those who have fear ﻿and those who don't. ﻿The goalkeeper can't fear. He is different. ﻿If you want to be goalkeeper you can not be afraid of being different. If you want to be equal, go be attacker. You have nine more like you. The Goalkeeper has his own area ﻿an unique uniform ﻿gloves ﻿and is the number one. ﻿And the best of all: only the goalkeeper can fly. Fly? Yes. ﻿I never believed in goalkeeper who at the penalty kick, he tries one side. What do you think of that? ﻿I think it's risky. ﻿When I was in front of ﻿the penalty mark ﻿I looked at the ball my gaze was fixed on it and thought of nothing else. ﻿the kicker, his eyes, his swings, the fans... I was really focuced on the ball ﻿when the attacker kicked the ball my eyes followed its direction ﻿And I'd fly towards the ball. ﻿Did it work? Not always but when it worked it was fun. ﻿It was a great party. ﻿I had a great feeling ﻿that I'm not able to describe it. ﻿Beto. ﻿You'll be fine. You'll be a great goalkeeper, I'm sure. ﻿Don't be afraid of being different. ﻿Good night. ﻿Good night. ﻿You are going home tomorrow, ok? ﻿But doctor, Am I going to play soccer again? ﻿Of course you will. ﻿I don't want these cards, I want my big fat one. ﻿Which fat one? ﻿My hippo. ﻿It is there with you. ﻿Be carefull, don't let it hit the corner. ﻿Where do we put it? ﻿- There, please. ﻿You stole my peacock. You steal everything from me. ﻿My zebra, my fat hippo... ﻿They are there with you, look it better. ﻿You brought it. They should have brought. ﻿Take off your hands from my cards, Ismael. ﻿Hey partner, you need a wheelchair like mine. ﻿It is fault here. ﻿Then I don't play anymore. ﻿Ismael, get in the game. ﻿Come on, walk. ﻿Come here, Beto. ﻿Firm your feet on the floor and walk here. ﻿He is afraid. ﻿Go, go. ﻿Mom, I'm walking. ﻿I see you. ﻿See? ﻿Leonor, come outside to see Beto. ﻿Oh, my son. ﻿Thanks God. ﻿If you knew how much I prayed. Blessed be Our Lord Jesus Christ! ﻿Beto, can you go to Tanaka's? ﻿Mom, may I go out there ﻿to show to my friends. - ﻿Go son, be careful. - ﻿I will. ﻿It is good to see him walking again. ﻿A child must walk, don't you think? ﻿Maria, this boy is very especial. ﻿Where there is children even the devil cut road short. ﻿Beto is walking again! ﻿Are you already walking? ﻿No, stupid. He is flying. ﻿I thought you wouldn't walk anymore. ﻿Want to replace me at the game? No. I have to be patient. ﻿There's a time for everything. ﻿Can I watch soccer games? ﻿Yes you can, Beto. ﻿If it's only for watching, you can. ﻿God doesn't want us to get into competition. ﻿Then I can see my ﻿friends at soccer field? ﻿Yes, If you will only watch, you may. ﻿If I wasn't here, we were lost! ﻿Get back to defense. ﻿What's happening with you, Beto? ﻿- He's afraid. ﻿You better worry with ﻿your team, Pilico. ﻿Looser! ﻿What's happening, Beto? ﻿I don't know. I think I've ﻿lost the ability. ﻿Call Silva to replace me. ﻿Nobody is going to replace you. You are fooling around. ﻿Do you really want to leave? - ﻿No. Let's play ball. - Yeah... ﻿Stop Hiroshi. ﻿The game is tied now. Hey, it's penalty kick. ﻿Which side are you going to try? ﻿Do your part. ﻿Rosa, whose car is that? ﻿Dad left the taxi and bought a new car. ﻿Wow. It is a Dodge. ﻿It has tape-record. ﻿Hey Dad, lets go for a ride. ﻿Let's go to visit the city, Dad? ﻿Who wants some icecream? ﻿Dad, can this car run ﻿100 kilometers per hour? ﻿This car runs faster than Fittipaldi. ﻿Then you win a competition a﻿gainst Emerson Fittipaldi? ﻿Huh, I leave him in the dust! ﻿- Are you Beto? - Yes. ﻿- They say you are the best keeper around!? - ﻿Yeah ?! - What is the secret? ﻿I have style. ﻿Yeah! But you still have to score, huh? ﻿Barriga's team wants a match revenge for tomorrow! ﻿Tomorrow?! No way. ﻿We must play this game on saturday ﻿it has to be at the Vila Nova field. ﻿- Humm, someone farted here. - It was Pardal. ﻿Hey, let's Beto talk. ﻿This game is very ﻿important for us. ﻿And on saturdays Vila Nova is crowded ﻿it's our change to show everyone ﻿who is the best team in Vila Nova. And if we lose? ﻿Everyone is going to see that we are the worst team at Vila Nova. - ﻿Lose?! Are you seeing ﻿any looser here? ﻿Beto is the best keeper around. ﻿- Yeah. Nobody will score in the game. ﻿We must stop playing like amateurs: ﻿We must have soccer uniforms ﻿and I also want a referee. ﻿My dad can be referee. He doesn't work on saturdays. ﻿- Then I also want to play. - You're a milk-tooth. ﻿If I don't play, I tell to dad. ﻿Oh yeah? Then I will tell ﻿everyone that you pee in bed. ﻿Let's call Pelezinho. ﻿But he lives on the other side of the street. ﻿So what? They are calling Tarzan, six against six. ﻿It is going to be the match of our ﻿lives. Everyone will be there. ﻿It's our chance. Let's show them whom "The boys in Kichute" really are! ﻿That's right president! ﻿But Beto have you forgotten that ﻿the ball is without one leather stripe? I save it to me. S﻿aturday morning I will take it to a repair store. ﻿But Ze Luiz, where are the uniforms of our team? ﻿My mother already made all of them except the keeper uniform. ﻿The goalkeeper? Ah, leave that to me. ﻿Rosa? ﻿Hi Beto. Is Rosa home? N﻿o, she went somewhere. ﻿I helped my mother paint the numbers on your uniforms. ﻿Oh yeah?! - ﻿Yeah! Do you need help? ﻿If you feel like it. ﻿Soninha! ﻿I'll have to go now. ﻿Mothers. ﻿Soccer is competition, ﻿there is no champion for God ﻿it's time to choose, God or the world? ﻿I want coffee with milk. ﻿Quiet, pisser. I'll make it for you. I h﻿aven't pissed today. ﻿Where are you going? Roberto!? ﻿Where do you think ﻿you're going with that ball? ﻿Which ball? Ah, this one? It belongs to the club. - ﻿What club? - "Boys in Kichute" ﻿Are you in a club? ﻿No. It's only to arrange matches. ﻿Games? Haven't I told you not to get involved with this thing. ﻿Are you challenging me, boy? You know what, Beto? ﻿There will be no more school for you. You will go to work. ﻿At your age I left home before dawn to harvesting cotton. ﻿Give me this ball here. Go in there and start to scrape the bathroom walls. ﻿Lazaro! Haven't ﻿I told you to go inside? ﻿Father! I like to play soccer, ﻿can't you understand that? ﻿You cant like it. You have to be a worker like I am a worker. ﻿You think I am the only painter in the world? There are many of them. ﻿I have to compete with each one of them. ﻿I thought God doesn't ﻿allow competition. ﻿He doesn't. But this is something else. It is work no competition. ﻿Father, I am not equal to you? ﻿Are you equal to whom? Soccer Players? ﻿I am not equal to anybody. ﻿I just want to do what I like. Let the boy do what he likes. ﻿Ok. To me you can do whatever you want to. ﻿I give up on you. ﻿But you can be sure of one thing: ﻿you are losing your soul for the rest of your life, because of a beast dream. ﻿Why are you wearing your sister's blouse? Mr. ﻿Herculano, you look like a referee. ﻿I Look like? I am well known as the king of the whistle, boys. ﻿But Ze Luiz likes the game best. His father is the referee. ﻿I am not here to whistle for my son. ﻿I am here to whistle for all of you. ﻿Ah, I doubt it. ﻿Listen to me. If you were referee, would you rob in the match? ﻿Not me. I wouldn't. ﻿Very well. ﻿I would have done it. ﻿If he falls, I whistle penalty kick, even if it wasn't. ﻿For ten bucks, I score agaist my own team. ﻿Boys, all I want is that you have fun with the game. ﻿Because you are the players. ﻿Let's play ball, right? ﻿They're taking too long to come. ﻿Look at them, they are coming. - ﻿Look the "Boys in Kichute" ﻿Let's do it Boys. Let's go. Put the ball on the mark. ﻿Face or crown? ﻿- Face. - ﻿Crown. ﻿You win. What do you chose? ﻿Ball or field? ﻿- Ball. - ﻿Which side do you want? ﻿- That one. - Go there then. ﻿Let's do a fair play, huh? ﻿Everything ok? ﻿Everything ok? ﻿You are offside. You were in the same line. ﻿Calm down! Calm down! Hey boy stop that. ﻿I will drill the ball. Damn it. ﻿It's a foul. - ﻿A yellow card for you. - Father whistling the game, huh? ﻿I'm not here to whistle a game for my son. ﻿I'm counting nine steps. One, two, ... - ﻿Beto, Beto. Are you ready for the big game? ﻿It is a great match! Barriga's soccer team deserves our respect. ﻿But we are ready to win and ﻿to give joy to the soccer fans. ﻿You have style, huh? ﻿Of course. Excuse me, I have to go back to the game. ﻿Here. You can kick only a﻿fter I whistle. - ﻿Are you ready keeper? - Ok. - T﻿o the right. ﻿- Can we go? - Go. Ah! Why don't you go kick a cow's ass! ﻿Free kick. For God's sake. ﻿Pardal, watch your back. ﻿Edivaldo, you're a fake. ﻿Kick away, Silva. ﻿Ze Luiz, goalkeeper ball! ﻿You're a fake. Beto. ﻿- Don't piss me off. - ﻿Damn it, Beto. What was that? ﻿You have style, huh? ﻿Hey fake goalie. ﻿Mom is calling you. She already knows you ruined Rosa's blouse. ﻿Today you will get your ﻿share, she said. ﻿They say if you put Q-boa soap, the acrilex vanishes. ﻿Beto, your father left home. ﻿What? ﻿He left with Jacira. ﻿Alcione's wife? ﻿Yes. He came to bring the news, poor man. ﻿Ah, don't suffer like that. Man is like cachaça, in every corner you find one. ﻿Hi people. ﻿The mood is down. ﻿What happened? - ﻿Lazaro... - He ran away with Jacira. ﻿When I was eighteen and he found out about me ﻿He tried to give me a lesson on how to be man. ﻿And then I asked him: what is to be a man? ﻿And he answered: It is to ﻿take responsibility like a man! ﻿Coward. ﻿He had no courage to tell me. Neither the children he thought. ﻿I do not know what did I do to deserve this? ﻿I did everything a woman can do next to a man. ﻿And if he comes back? ﻿He better go to hell, because here he ain't allowed. ﻿If he wants to, he enters. ﻿- Shut up. - ﻿You shut up. ﻿- Calm down, folks. ﻿We were so happy. ﻿No one is happy all the time. You lost only the husband. ﻿You still have your family, your friends and your children. ﻿Do you want me to stay overnight? ﻿No thanks. ﻿Ismael, go take a bath. Rosa, go out there and bring the clothes. ﻿Beto, from now on, you are ﻿the man of this house. ﻿- So? - Wrong pass. - ﻿But the kid is good. - ﻿He ain't good in avoiding fouls. - ﻿Is that him? - Yeah. That's him. - ﻿Huh... - ﻿The boy is good. He has style. L﻿ook, that boy got hurt. ﻿Let's go there help him. ﻿I'm coming. ﻿No. I'm ok, let's keep playing ball. ﻿- I'm ok, want to stay in the game. - Are you a doctor? ﻿Young man, who taught you to jump in front of the attacker? ﻿Where do you live, boy? ﻿Ivai street 280, in the back. - ﻿I'll take you home. - I want to try again. ﻿- Today, you're released of the test. - ﻿When are you having another? ﻿- For you? Never again. ﻿You passed the test! ﻿When I tell my mother, she will jump up full of happiness. Thank you Mr. ﻿Don't thank me. Thank yourself. Our club is a family. ﻿I'm Volpone. I run the juvenile soccer team at National Atletico Clube. ﻿- What happened to my son? - It was only a scratch during the game. ﻿- Game? ﻿- Great man of the house! - ﻿Shut up. - ﻿Go ahead Mr... - ﻿Volpone! ﻿- Would you like some coffee? - Yes! ﻿- Go get it, Ismael. ﻿Well, I will be quick so I do not hinder you. ﻿Your son took a test and was ﻿selected to be part of the Nacional. ﻿We pay for all the structure and we offer ﻿a small salary in the beginning. ﻿We have some requirements: stay in school, good grades... ﻿If we move to another village? Is there a problem? ﻿No, in fact, we pay the ﻿transportation. ﻿Good news, my son. ﻿- Well... ﻿Well, I have to go. Tomorrow ﻿you go to my office. ﻿Congratulations to the talented boy you have! Take care kid. - ﻿Bye, Mr. Volpone. ﻿Beto goalkeeper. ﻿If dad was here, he wouldn't allow. ﻿But he isn't. Now I'm dad and mom in this house. I don't want to hear about him anymore. ﻿Do you understand or I have to speak another language? ﻿- Is it tasty, son? - ﻿Yes. ﻿Rosa, Beto became goalkeeper of the Nacional! ﻿I knew you would pass the test. ﻿Now I want the big party you promised me and you have to buy a new blouse to me. - ﻿Mrs. Leonor? ﻿- Mrs. Leonor? ﻿Wanna see cartoons? ﻿No, thanks. ﻿You liked her, huh? ﻿There was once, it was my birthday ﻿and she called me here. ﻿She played in her accordion happy birthday ﻿to me. She played several times. ﻿Then I started laughing and ﻿she also laughed. We laughed a lot and then she said: Happy Beto's day! ﻿Jacira, bring me the towel, please. ﻿Go and get it. I am not your maid. ﻿- Your mom will find out. - Barriga, why you missed the soccer test? ﻿Everybody knows that you play soccer best than everyone else here. ﻿Soccer to me is just for fun. I find it strange beeing paid to have fun. ﻿I don't like that, so I am going to be a doctor. ﻿Dr. Barriga?! ﻿Who wants to be medicated by a doctor named Barriga? ﻿- But doctor, you do all types of examination? - Of course. ﻿Then examine here. ﻿I'm leaving that sink, Mr. Luiz. The new house already comes with one. ﻿I can already see the houses being made with phone and everything. ﻿- Mom, what's going on? - We are moving to a new house. ﻿- But is today? - ﻿Yes. A new house. ﻿Look around the yard and see if we left things behind then put in the truck. ﻿- Where have you been? - I was playing. ﻿Hurry up. It's charged per hour. ﻿I have things to do here. I'm president of my club, and have school too. ﻿Beto relax, they also have school there. ﻿Hey, be careful with that TV. ﻿Thank you for everything Mr. Luiz, Mrs. Janete you are good friends. - ﻿Thank you too. Life's much better when we have friends. ﻿- Are you coming back? - I think so. - Are you throwing that blouse away? - No. Why? ﻿- I think it fits on me. - Do you like to play soccer? ﻿I like the goalkeeper.
