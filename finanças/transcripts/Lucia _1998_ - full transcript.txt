To Kate and I's mama and papa. Mama and papa. Mama and papa. Cheese is fantastic. Where'd you get it from, Hamish? Ah, from Sainsbury's actually. What time do we start tomorrow? At 10:30. The usual time. We're going from the top of this scene. That's our scene. That's our scene. Tu sei turbato. - The piano has been tuned. - Piano as well. Oh, great. That's good. What were the chances? Well, it might not sound like that. - Have you tried on your costume? - No. Who's tried on their costumes here? Has anyone tried on their costumes? Is it that orange shirt? - Why has this charming person… - I love that shirt. What the hell are you doing here, Sam? We missed you last night. I had to tell Patrine. I have to talk to you. It's five o'clock in the morning. I've got nothing to say to you. You must go, now. I can't. I must tell you about my dream. If my brother found you here, he'd probably kill you. He put you in that tower so that you'd be as far away from me as you could be. Please let me stay for five minutes. I can't go now. It's pointless trying to change my mind. I'm getting married to Oliver at the end of the week and you'll be out of my life forever. Last night, I had this incredible dream about the Ravenswoods. I dreamt that I was the real Edgardo in the opera. Your brother was Enrico and you were Lucia, his sister. Singers often dream about their characters. But there was something terrifyingly real about this one, Kate. Don't be melodramatic. It was a dream. And this sounds like an excuse for some bad behavior. Have you never been transported into the spirit of the characters you sing? Of course I have, but they're still just characters, from another century. Well, I don't believe you. I know that when you're singing Lucia, you're in love with Edgardo, for instance. In your dreams. Now bug off, back to your tower. Please. Please don't, Sam. I've got too much to lose. You can't marry a man you don't love just because your brother needs cash to keep this company going. How do you know I don't love him? Because I know you love me, Kate. - And I am in love with you. - Liar. You say that to all the sopranos you sing with. I didn't really need this job. Hamish asked me to do it as a favor. I took it because I wanted you. It's too late. I can't let Hamish down now. Hamish doesn't give a toss about you. You'll be stuck with Oliver for the rest of your life all for the sake of this crawling pile. God, it's insane. I love my brother. And Olly is so sweet. Well, don't expect me to be at the wedding tomorrow. I've got a recital in Edinburgh tomorrow. You'd better be back for the opera on Saturday. I promise. Morning, Oliver. Just like these dots, just crisp them up a bit. - Okay? And then we have to... - Okay. Take it back over there. Yeah. Same for you. Okay, I'll take it from the top. Come on. Okay. Bravo. Okay. See you at the boat house. Oliver's persuaded his parents to fly in for the wedding. They're arriving by helicopter. Poor old Oliver. His own wedding in the afternoon and then another one in the opera in the evening. His parents have never seen him singing in an opera. They're in for a shock. I've never seen him sober on stage. Alice, this is the man I'm marrying tomorrow. I'm sorry, Kate. I just can't take it seriously. You must. Thanks for letting me do this concert. It's been very difficult. We've had to rework the whole day. Don't worry. I promise to be back for the performance on Saturday night. I understand the soprano you're working with is very beautiful. Nothing compared to your sister. I'm so sorry you might not make it to the wedding, Sam. Sorry I'm late. Where have you been? - What page are you on? - Forty. Okay, shall we just carry on from where you were? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Here we go then. Sam's coming. I'll leave you to it. I'm off. See you later. You're late. Sam Ravenswood just got in. Caledonian Hotel. See you there. - Welcome to Lammermoor. - Hamish. I'd like you to meet my wife, Sugar. - Nice to meet you. Lovely. - Hi. - Wow. This is magical. - Let's go into the house. - It's a great place you got here, Hamish. - Thank you very much. - He's so cute. Who's that? - It's his son. Oh, I didn't recognize him. He's gone Scottish. Hi, son! - Wow, it's fabulous here. - This is a wonderful place. Thank you. Darling. - This is great. - We'll take good care of you. Son. So, let's go into the house and meet Carrington. How big is it? It's about 100 acres here, but we own the chapel across the way as well, yeah. Kate! - Hamish. - Shh. Hi, Bill. Fuck it. Dearly beloved… …since you have now pledged yourselves to one another in the covenant of marriage and have made your declaration before God and these witnesses, I pronounce you to be husband and wife in the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Kate, Oliver, friends, guests and our new American relatives and those who are fortunate enough to be born in Scotland. This is a very exciting day. I'm almost speechless, so this won't take too long. The late lamented Lord Ashton, father of the bride, was my closest friend. And he would have been here today, but, unfortunately, he passed away 12 months ago. But I know, but for that unfortunate occurrence, he would have been delighted to be here at such a merry gathering. I remember the day Kate was born. She was due on the Tuesday, didn't arrive till the Thursday, and yet if I may say so, she's never been on time for anything since. That is why it was such a shock when she arrived on time for the wedding. Kate, my dear, marriage is like a violin, when the beautiful music is over, the strings are still attached. Marriage is nature's way of keeping people from fighting with strangers. And so we come to this moment when we say with joy, Kate and Oliver, the bride and groom. The bride and groom! - The bride and groom. - The bride and groom. Oh, please, come on. Ah, no, no. I don't think we really should, Sugar. It'll be fun. Come on. Don't be silly. Oh, Jesus. Darlings, you were absolutely fabulous. Divine. I feel like I've gone to heaven and heard the angels sing. You were especially spectacular. Kate! Sugar. I can't believe you went through with it this afternoon, Kate. I somehow imagined you'd changed your mind. I told you I wouldn't. I've given you a hundred percent and you've done this to me. Have you slept with him? No. We're sleeping in this bed tonight. This used to be my parents' bedroom. Hasn't been used since mommy died. Perhaps you might like to tell me how your recital went in Edinburgh last night? It was all right. Oliver. Sam was just leaving. You stupid twat. You fuckin' whore. Oliver, you're drunk. Put that knife away, for God's sake. Conjugal rights, it's crap. You're my wife now. You're my wife now. Oh, God. You're my wife now. You're my wife. You're my wife. But where's my husband? Better get help on this. You're my wife now. You're my wife. Where's my husband? But where's my husband? Come on, honey, that's it. - Do we clap? - No, no, no. Something terrible happened. Something's not right. Uh, it's part of the opera. No, no, something's wrong. Look. Look, this is real blood. Quick, get help. Call an ambulance. Quick! - Where's the telephone? - Over here! Norman! Norman, quick, come help! Can you do something? Oliver's dead.
