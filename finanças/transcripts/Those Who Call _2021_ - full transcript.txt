[music playing] [glasses clink] [car driving] [whispering voices] [phone ringing] Hey, Nick. Hey, how's the trip? How far are you from the house? It's OK, I'm still cruising. I'm about six hours away still? Holy shit. You know this is why they invented the thing called planes, right? So we don't have to drive everywhere? Oh, whatever. It's not that bad. I enjoy the solitude. How's Scott been since he got there? Not bad, besides thinking I was one of Mom's old boyfriends. Or that I was coming to rob the damn house! And He's all right. He's still our old man. I feel bad for laughing at him. It breaks Mom's heart. Yeah. We just got to-- Nick? [static noise] Maureen? Sorry, you're cutting up. [inaudible] Nick? [static noise] Nick! Promise you-- [call ends] Well, I guess I'll see you soon. Shit. Damn it. Of course, this would happen to me. [music playing] [owl hooting] [crickets chirping] [girl struggling] [ominous music] [drums pounding] [thunder] Ah! [whispering voices] [fire crackling] [girl screams] [music playing] (soundtrack) Thinking of better days when summer was endless. Dreaming of our escape, because I can't help it. It's only me, to stay with me. Someday I'll be under the way. This is my dream, and it's you and me. I can feel the cheering now. Holding onto heaven, love. I'll take this time, while we know we'll rise. Heaven, love. Is it something due if it's something for in life. [instrumental music] Hey! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Hey! [instrumental playing] Hey! [upbeat music] This is going to be good for the both of us, you know? The woods, the hiking, getting away from everything. Just your heads. Yeah. I guess you're right. We definitely needed this. Hey, it's going to be OK. Just try not to think about it, all right? I know. Thanks for bringing me along. Oh, don't mention it. Besides, I can't drive 18 hours on my own. That's what little sisters are for. Hey, so what's the place in Colorado you told me about, the one with the waterfall? Seven Falls? Yeah, that one. Oh, it's beautiful. You're going to love it there. It's so peaceful and quiet, and I know you're going to love taking pictures there. That sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. And there's this park called Inspirational Point. You got to hike a long way, but from what I hear, it's definitely worth it. Yeah, I don't know about that. I think I'll pass. On what, the hiking? Yeah, it sounds like a lot of work. Come on, we'll do it together. I don't know. Plus, I'm definitely out of shape. Well, just so you know, to get to the falls you have to go up these stairs, and they're huge. There's a lot of steps. Why do y'all have to pick the hardest places? I didn't, everyone goes there. You can definitely do it. Come on, cheer up. OK, what else is there? Well, there's this place called Garden of the gods. That one's a little easier to get to. No, no. Something other than hiking. Oh! Well, there's weed farms. OK, we can do that instead. Just try to enjoy it and have fun, OK? After all, this is the bonding time you've been asking for. Yes, I know. I know I've been busy with work and we haven't really had a lot of time to be together, but it'll be like the good old times. Just the two of us, I promise. Ah, just, it sucks that this had to happen in order for us to hang out. Hey, come on, don't say that. You know how things are. Say what? That your business is more important than I am? And that you haven't seen me in over three years? Sandra, that's not it at all. You know this. I have worked. I-- Look, I understand that this is a tough time for you, but it's tough for me too. I know. I'm sorry. [music playing] Dang, look at this place? Not a house in sight, not even a gas station. Nothing but empty roads. Well, good thing we have gas. It's not a lot, but it'll do for now. So where are we? Well, if you hadn't been asleep the whole way over, you'd know. We're in Texas somewhere. OK, well, this place is definitely creepy. Yeah, tell me about it. I can't remember the last time I saw anything. It's like people don't even live here. Well, I do remember seeing some abandoned houses back there, in that weird town? Oh, that old creepy town? Yeah. Oh, god, that's true. Yeah, it was like a ghost town. Not a single person was in sight. Well, maybe people just got tired of this place and left. OK, but do you wonder why? That I don't know. [whispering voices] Hello? [ominous sounds] Hip, what are you doing? I don't know I think I heard someone talking. I didn't hear anything. Yeah. Maybe I'm just hearing things. This place is just weird. If I was superstitious, I'd be really freaked out right now. OK. Well, let's not stay here for long and get the hell out of here. Hey. Hey. Come on, it's your turn. Ready? So how long do we have? Oh, just shut up and drive. [whispering voices] I want to do this for him. What? Colorado. The reason why we're going, I want to do this for him. Inspirational Point was on his bucket list. Really? Yeah, but he never had a chance to go, and I figured, we'd go for him. Ana, he had a great life, and he went to a lot of places. Trust me, you don't have to do any of this to proof for him. I know that. I just-- I figured we could do something in his honor. Isn't that a little too late for that? You should have been there for him when he was alive. I have a busy life. I have things to take care of. Yeah. No, I know. You've always been too busy for the people that you love. And it's just too late for remorse. What the fuck is your problem? I'm here doing this for us, and you want to say that to me? Like I was the worst person Dad-- Do not. Sleep. Like I didn't take care of him? You're not doing this for us. This is for you! I'm doing this for the both of us! You are back online. You will reach your destination by 3:45-- GPS is back on. --AM. About time. See, what did I tell you? There's nothing to worry about. Just follow the GPS and we'll be fine. Hey. Hey, I think that's a gas station! What, where? I didn't see it. Where? Sandra, turn around. What are you doing? I don't know. Do you think it's safe to stop there? What? We need gas. Don't we have gas in the back? That was our last one. We haven't filled any of them up since this morning. Ugh, about time we find a gas station. Clearly this place doesn't have a lot of them. OK, guess we'll do that. Speaking of creepy places. [ominous sounds] Stay close, OK? [ominous sounds] [birds chirping] Can I help you ladies? Yeah. We're just looking for some gas or something. Are you the owner? I guess you could say that. Looking for gas, you said? Yeah. Me and my sister were just traveling to Colorado, and we're just looking for some gas. I could tell you girls aren't from around town. No, no, we're just passing by. You girls shouldn't be here. I think we should go. Look, sir, we're just looking for some gas or something. That's all. There's no gas for 50 miles around here. There's not enough to go around for everybody. We don't give gas to strangers. Excuse me, what do you mean? There's no other gas station around here? Look, we will pay whatever you ask for, OK? We just really need gas. You say you'll pay. OK? Look, it's not about money. OK? It's about them. They see me talking to you. If who sees you? Look, I said too much. You shouldn't be here, just please go! If who sees you? What are you talking about? Go! I can't help you. Sandra, let's go, go, go! See you soon. [ominous sounds] OK, what the fuck just happened? I have no idea. But what is wrong with these people! They looked psycho. And that one little girl. Don't talk about the girl, she gave me the creeps. OK. We need to get the hell out of this town. Everything's been weird since we got here. How much gas do we have? We don't have a lot. OK, let's not panic. We can just search around for another gas station. Ana, that was the only place we had near us, and look at what happened? There's got to be something else around here. There has to be. Oh, shit. I'm not getting any signal. OK, worst case scenario, we can just call Theo and he'd come bring some gas. No, we're not calling Theo! I'm just saying, worst case scenario. What is he going to do, drive all the way over here to drop off some gas? This trip was a mistake. Really? You agreed to this. Yeah, that's before we got stranded. We are not stranded. We just need to find some gas. Just calm down. What if we don't find anything? I don't know, Sandra, but we'll find a way. There's got to be something else around here. Just, give me your phone. No frickin' signal. Great. OK, just keep driving down. We'll find another gas station somewhere. There has to be something else around here. We'll be OK. [instrumental music] GPS signal lost. Fuck. Hey, Ana. Hey, wake up. What? What? I think we're lost. What do you mean we're lost? I don't know what happened. I accidentally missed an exit, and I tried to leave to go back, but now we're in the middle of the woods. OK, OK, OK, OK, just calm down. I'm sure we haven't gone too far. We'll find our way out. Just keep driving. Sandra, Sandra, I can't leave you alone, can I? Stop playing. We don't even know where we're at. We'll be all right. Stop being such a drama queen. Ana. Ana, look. [ominous sounds] What the hell? [flies buzzing] I know that's some weird shit right there. [flies buzzing] It's fucking creepy. [ominous sounds] So are we? Just keep driving. Keep your eyes on the road. I'm sure we're not too far from the main road. It doesn't look like it. We're surrounded by woods. Should we stop and go back? To get more lost! No, thank you. What the fuck? Is that the same thing as before? What the hell? That's not supposed to be there. That's just weird, the GPS shows a straight road ahead. What do you mean? I don't know, OK? That's what it shows! Let me see. [ominous music] That's wrong. This is wrong. Maybe it's just because of the signal, OK? Just keep going. Maybe there was two of them. [heavy breathing] Ana, we're going in fucking circles. We're going in circles! I know, OK? I just-- OK, just-- Fuck off. I think we ran out of gas. What? Try to start it up again! Ana, I'm trying, OK? How about I just trying, like I can't turn it on! Fuck! OK. OK, OK, OK. Hey, it's OK. Look at me. Look at me. It's OK. Let's call Theo. No! We're not calling Theo, Ana, we-- he's already been through a lot! It's OK! It's OK, I'm sure he'll understand. You said for emergencies only. Look around, Sandra! We ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere. This is an emergency. What are you even going to tell him? We don't even know where we're at. I don't know. I can somewhat redirect him here, give him road signs or something. Ana! I-- Ana, we're both lost. How is he even going to get to us? Let me at least try, OK? Just do whatever-- Just let me try! Do whatever you want! Fuck! Come on. [wolves howling] Come on, come on, come on. Shit. I'm not getting any signal. What? I'm not getting any signal. I can't call him. You try. Well, I still don't have any service. Shit. So what now? [night sounds] We spend the night here. Are you fucking crazy? It's too dark out to go anywhere. We'll try calling again if we get some signal. We're just a little lost. In the morning, we can go get help. I'm not spending a night here, Ana. What other choice do we have? Look, the nearest road is probably not too far from here. I'm sure we'll be fine. Tomorrow, we can go get help. What about the creepy vibes that we get from this place? And everything that's been happening? And that gas station guy? Relax! We'll be fine. We've just been driving for a while. We're both tired. We just need some rest. We're going to be OK, I promise. Just don't want to spend the night here, Ana. Look at this damn place. It's pitch dark! I'm just trying to be positive, OK? What other choice do we have? Look, we'll spend the night here, and as soon as the sun comes out, we can go look for gas, OK? [speaking spanish] [door slams shut] [night sounds] I have a bad feeling about this place. Don't stress. It's just a couple more hours till sunrise, anyway. Yes, and a lot can happen till then. What's the worst that can happen? We haven't seen anyone all day. No animal can get inside. As long as we stay here, we'll be fine. Do we have enough water and food? Yes. And there're plenty of snacks too. We can take it tomorrow and we can leave early. Did you bring your knife? Mm-hmm. All right here. And if anyone tries to get near you, I'll slice them up, OK? Now go to sleep. [crickets chirping] [voices whispering] Hey, what's wrong? Nothing, nothing. Go back to sleep. What's wrong? I think I heard someone talking. Someone talking? Yeah, like whispering. What do you think it was? I don't know. Maybe an owl or something? An owl? Yes, an owl. Give me your flashlight. For what? I'm going to see what it is. Are you stupid? Why would you go out there? It could have been someone walking by. They could help us. From a stranger? In the middle of the night? Do you have any better ideas? Yeah, I thought so. Ana. Be careful, OK? Stay in the car. [car door sliding open] [wolves howling in the distance] [ominous sounds] Hello? [ominous sounds] Hello? My sister and I are stranded. We need gas? Hello? [ominous music] [whispering voices] Hello? [crunching footsteps] Ana? Ana, is that you? [crunching footsteps] Ana? Ana, where are you? Ana! [crunching footsteps] Ana? [crunching footsteps] [speaking non-english] Ana! [speaking non-english] Ana! [ominous beat] What happened? What happened? I saw someone. There was someone out there. Lock the door! Are you sure? Yeah! There was someone out there! I saw a figure! I don't see anything. Ana, I'm not seeing things. There was someone out there! Where? It was right there. I don't know! OK, OK, OK, calm down. I believe you, OK? I believe you. Let's just stay in here, OK? And we'll keep an eye out. Whatever it is, it can't get in, OK? Just calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down. OK. It's OK, it's OK. [ominous instrumental sounds] I don't see or here anything. I know what I saw, Ana. Maybe it was like a tree, like a shadow of a tree? No, it looked like a person. It was an actual person standing right there. Well, whatever it is, it's not here anymore. Yeah. I don't see anything anymore. Hey, it's OK. We're going to be OK. Just try to get some rest. I'll keep watch. Don't worry. Well, I'll try. I'm right here. [inaudible] Don't worry about it, OK? [night sounds] Oh! Sandra? Sandra, wake up. Wake up! What is that? What's going on? Come on, let's go. Let's go! [ominous music] [running footsteps] [forest sounds] [ominous music] [heavy breathing] Fuck. What the hell just happened? I don't know. We woke up. We were in the woods, underneath-- in front of that, that thing there. OK. But where are we? Where's the car? I have no idea. We're deep in the woods. I-- [birds chirping] This is some evil shit we got ourselves into. Don't touch it. Those things in the trees? I know what they are, I saw them on my trip to Cuba in a small village. It's brujeria. They're made to guard against intruders. What does that mean? It's a warning. It means we're not supposed to be here. Where are we? I don't-- I don't know. This whole forest just seems off. Maybe we wandered off. What was that back there? I don't know, OK? I woke up just like you did. I don't know what's happening. Can you remember anything? No. I just remember us being in the car last night, and just going to sleep. But that's all. Yeah. Me too. This whole thing is fricking, fricking weird. Ana? I feel like we're being watched. Ana, I told you. I told you, we should just turned back. And go fucking where? There's nowhere to go! Ana, I just wanted to get away for a while and enjoy a good time. Just forget about this past week. I didn't ask for any of this! Oh, and you think I did? Look, whatever is going on, we need to figure it out. I'm just as confused as you are! OK, but we shouldn't have stayed here. We shouldn't have spent the night here. We should have seen this coming. I told you I had a bad feeling about this place! Calm down! Just calm down, OK? Look, look, we still have our supplies, right? Neither of us are hurt. You're not hurt, right? We just need to figure out how to get out of this forest and try to find the car. OK? [ominous music] [whispering voices] Hello? [ominous sounds] Is anyone there? Sandra? Sandra? Sandra, is everything OK? Yeah. I just, I thought I heard something. I thought I heard someone whispering, but-- I didn't hear anything. Come on, let's move. [ominous music] Oh. What? You're joking with me. OK, we're going to need more water. You know, I had a dream about this once. I remember that I got lost in the woods and I was trying to look for you or Dad, but I couldn't find any of you guys. And then, I just felt like I was being followed so I just started to run. And then, I just ran and I ran. And I was running in circles, just like last night. Stop. I'm not going to leave your side. That's what Dad used to say. So do you want to cremate him, or do you want to bury him? We're obviously burying him. Why? That's what he would want! But cremating him is so much cheaper. Yes, but no, we're not going to do that. Are you going to be paying for it? I don't think so, right? Do you really not care about anything? It's not that I don't care, Sandra. Like I said, are you going to be paying for this? I don't think so, huh? You know our situation. Oh, so now it's my fault, like always. Because I'm never here, right? You never were. The only reason why you came was because of Dad. You know I tried my best. OK? I don't know what your definition of best is because that's not it. Ah! Here we go. Ana, seriously, when did you ever give me a call? Texting me at least, hey, sister, are you doing OK? Are you-- is anything-- is everything good at home? When? You never texted me, Ana! You're thinking about your business right now, how much money you're going to make right now, instead of thinking about what's going to happen with me! You never fucking cared about me, Ana! Phones work both ways. So we're going to bury him, and I guess that's what it's going to be. I'll talk to David and we'll figure it out somehow. Now about the house. We're staying with the house. What? We're staying with that, we're not-- we're staying here. We're not doing anything to the house. Are you stupid? Do you know how much this house would sell on the market? Is that really what you're thinking about right now? Money. What else are we going to do, Sandra? Dad is dead. What are we going to do? What else are we going to do with this house? Live in this house? We're not going to sell this house, Ana. I'm not living here. I can literally get so many people to buy this house right now. Are you fucking serious? We're still talking about that? What else do you want to talk about? What else is there to say? You already said you want to bury him. Now what? We're not selling this house, and that's it. If we sell this house, we can-- We're not selling this house! We can easily split it between the two of us. I don't want the money. OK, then what's your plan? We don't sell the house, then what? We'll figure it out! What are you going to do? We'll figure it out. No, no, no, no, I-- No, no, no, no, no. Not we, I said, what are you going to do? What do you mean me? We're in this together. I have my own life, Sandra. I have a business to run. So my question is, what are you going to do? So you're leaving? I can't stay here. You know that. Why not? I have my own life with David! OK, but you can be here with David! You can come here and we can figure it out here, all of us together! Clearly, you don't know shit about anything. Ana, really, I know you have a life over there, and I know that you're happy. But, Ana, I need you. I need you to be here with me! Who gives a shit? I'm the one that knows how to put this house for sale, and I'm going to do it whether you like it or not. So you need to figure out what the hell to do, because you're not staying here. We're selling this house. [birds chirping] He loved you very, very much. He would never leave you behind. You know that's not what happened. If you say so. He had to grow. You know Dad couldn't be still, and he just had things to do. After mom died, he just-- he wasn't the same. So what, she just decided to take off and leave me behind? She didn't leave you behind. Ana, I was on my own, trying to survive for four months. And where were you? Too stupid to take care of me? I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry. I was scared too. Dad left both of us, remember? Not just you. I could take it all back, I would. But I can't, and you know that. Yeah, I know. I'm not going to leave your side. OK? I promise. He wouldn't like to see you suffering as much, especially not for him. Yeah, I know. Everything's going to be fine. We're going to find our way out, OK? OK. Now, come on. Let's go. Ah! We need to find a river or a lake or something. We need to find water and-- Shh! [whispering voices] And water? [whispering voices] I'm scared. What is it? We keep hearing this whispering sounds. What Is it? It's just the wind. The wind in the trees. Come on, let's go. It's not the trees. Keep moving. Keep moving. It's not the trees, you know it's not. Ana, they sounded like people. Like a lot of people were in there. And there's no one in this forest but us. I know. I know, OK? But we just have to keep moving. Come on. [birds chirping loudly] The weird cross thing. The whispering. Just the weird sensation of this place. Everything is going to be fine. We just have to find the car and-- Just give it up! Just give it up. We both know we're not going to find the car. We've been walking for hours, Ana, and if there was something nearby, we would have found it by now. You're right. We're not going to find the car. Well, at least for now, we just have to find some water, OK? We need it really bad. [water sounds] Ana, are you sure this is safe? It's the only other option we have. It's either this or we die of thirst. [humming] [whispering voices] What the hell? [whispering voices] [ominous music] [whispering voices] [soft crying] [chanting] Hey, are you OK? It's blood! Well, put some pressure on it. No, it's not mine! It's blood! Did you get it anywhere else? No, it's just my hands. [ominous beating] [ominous music] What the fuck? Right. So what happened, exactly? I don't know. I was just putting water, and out of nowhere, blood started coming down the river. I saw the amount of blood it was, and it was a lot, Ana. What was it from? A dead animal? No. OK, well, several animals. All the scalps that we've been seeing around. Maybe. Maybe it was something else. You're not trying to say it was human blood, right? I don't know. It could have been a million things. Just try to stay positive, OK? I don't want you to worry. I'm really trying to. [forest sounds] Let's just follow the trail. And maybe there's some water down by the river and we can find a safe spot. OK, well, you said that this trail's going to lead us somewhere, right? But what if it leads us on what we're not supposed to find? Like what? I don't know, Ana. You said it yourself, it could be anything! Yeah, but this trail is our only option. If there's a trail, that means people have been walking on it. So that means somewhere in this woods, there's got to be a person around here. Now, if only they're willing to help. Ana. That symbol. We've seen it before. [music playing] On Dad's things. What? [sad music] It's just weird. One day, he's calling us and telling us of his adventurous life, and now he's gone out of nowhere. It's really weird. Dad was not the type to get lost. He was hiking for so many years, and you know he was so safe. None of this makes sense to me. It really doesn't. Plus, with his military training, I doubt he wouldn't be able to do something to defend himself. Look, we might not ever know what happened to him. So let's just let the police do their job, and if something comes up, they'll let us know. But some of these things are just odd. It's like Dad had a whole other life that he didn't want anybody to know. Ana, we all have secrets. And he traveled a lot. So all that is memories. Yeah? Well, look at this. Maybe it's not even him in this picture. Probably someone gave it to him, or he found it to collect it. Woe to those who call evil good, good, evil. Isaiah: 520. What does that even mean? Well, it's from the Bible. Do you know how religious he was? Yeah, but Dad liked those weird parts of the Bible. Those are the best parts. It makes you think. This is a weird ring. Where did he get it from? I really don't know. Maybe from his travels? What is it? It looks like a circle with some wavy lines. Let me see. Well, looks like a tree, and these could be the branches. I don't know. Creepy. What do you think it means? I don't know, but if Dad had it his stuff, it must be important to him. No. This looks too small to belong to Dad. What do you mean? It looks small. Dad's fingers were way bigger than this. Yeah, this definitely belonged to someone else. Maybe a woman. Maybe it's Mom's. No I don't think so. Mom would definitely not wear something like that. Then maybe not hers, the whose? I don't know. The ring. The ring had that same symbol. Maybe it just looks like it. Ana, who you're trying to convince, me or yourself? I'm just saying, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the same symbol. Ana, look at it! It's the same damn symbol! It's weird, but maybe it can help us figure out what happened to Dad. What, are you crazy? Dad got lost, plain and simple. The police said it themselves. Yeah? Is that why he had holes on his wrist? And is that why he was begging for help on the side of the road? You don't have to do this. Sandra, this has nothing to do with Dad! I just want answers. I want to know what happened to him! I want them too, OK? But we're not going to find any by creating them in our own damn head! How much water do we have left? Just my bottle. I hope we can find more water soon. [crickets chirping loudly] [flies buzzing] [bird caws] [ominous sounds] What the hell? Sandra! Sandra! It's not-- It's a dead body. [ominous music] That's the gas station guy. What is he doing here? Why is he here? They did this. Who? Remember, he was scared of someone seeing him. That's why he wouldn't help us. Whoever it was, they did this to him. But I don't understand. Why him? He was from here. He told us about them. They didn't want us to know So we're next. We're going to get-- we're going to get killed next! No, no, no, I don't think so. Think about it. If they wanted to kill us, they would have done it by now. Why didn't they do it at the cross? Why wait this entire day? Why didn't they kill us at the car? They're waiting for something from us. They've been watching us. This entire time, they've been one step ahead of us. They knew we were going to cross here. They knew we were going to walk under it. But how did they know? OK, well, maybe they're trying to send a message. Well, what message? If they wanted to kill us, they would have killed us already! OK. Maybe they're not allowed to. The blood. The blood in the river, it was human blood. And the symbol, the ring. Do you believe me now? This is definitely about Dad. Maybe we're not dead because of him. But who are these people? What do they want? OK, let's just-- let's just follow the trip. Come on. What if we get lost? Look around, Sandra. We've been lost all day! [birds chirping] [flies buzzing] Come on, you need to walk faster. I'm trying, Ana, but I'm tired, I'm thirsty, and, Ana, it's so hot. I wish I had my phone. Yeah, I bet calling Theo now doesn't sound like such a bad idea, does it? I'm sorry, OK? I know we should have called when we had the chance. And now we're stuck here. We don't even know if we're going to make it out alive. Sandra, you didn't know this was going to happen. Don't blame yourself. OK, but what if we never make it out? Don't say that! There's got to be a way out. We just have to keep searching. But for what? Ana, you said it yourself, they're watching us. They're watching our every move! But they don't know that we're here! How do you know that? I don't know, I just-- Because I'm sure they wouldn't have wanted us to find that. What is it? It looks like a house. Like one of their houses? I don't-- I don't know. It's the only one around. So what do you want to do? We have to go inside. You're crazy. We're not going in there, Ana. Sandra, you said you wanted answers. No, we're not going in there! You said you wanted answers. This is our only chance. Come on. [ominous sounds] [ominous music] Ana. Ana, stop. Stay here. I'll be quick, OK? [ominous music] [wood boards creaking] I think it's abandoned. Yeah, looks like it's been like that for a while. We'll just search around for supplies. Anything we can take. Ana! Ana, come see this. What happened? Are these missing people? That's what they look like. What kind of lunatic will have posters of missing girls on the wall? I don't know. Whoever lived here must have had some fucked up mind. Ana, they're so young. And they're all women. Maybe that's what they like. Who knows, maybe they're out there looking for them. And for what? Some kind of sick self-reward? For all we know, maybe they're missing because of them. You know what? You were right. This place gives me the creeps. Maybe we should go. I don't-- What the fuck? What the hell is this? Ana! Is this some kind of sick joke? What's going on? Why would they have pictures of us? Hello? Ana, I want to go home! I don't want to be here. Ana! No! I want to go home! This can't be happening. This can't be happening. I want to go home, Ana. This can't be happening! Ana, I want to go home. I want to go home. I don't want to die. I don't want to be here, Ana! I don't want to be here! This can't be happening. I want to go home! I don't want to die! What's happening! I don't want to die here, Ana. I don't want to die. Ana, Ana, they're killing us. They're here, they're here, Ana. They're here, they're here. I don't want to die. Get up! [shouting] We're not going to die. We are going to get the fuck out of here. Come on! [drums beating] [rapid music] [drum beating once] I'm scared. Just keep going. Come on. Sandra. Sandra, come here. Come here. Come here. I want to go home. Hey, hey, hey, shh. I want to go-- I don't want to be here. Look at me. Look at me, Sandra. Sandra, you need to get this together, OK? We are stronger than this. I don't want to die here. I don't want to die. Sandra, Sandra, I'm scared too, OK? I'm scared. I don't want to die. We are not going to die. Sandra, Sandra, we are not going to die, OK? We will get through this. Whatever's going on, it's not fair. We didn't do anything. OK? Whatever is going on, it's really fucked up. It's fucked up. But this is what they want. OK? This is what they want. Whoever's doing this, they want to see us like this. They want us weak and scared. We can't let them in, OK? I don't want-- Don't give in. And where are they? I mean, we-- I don't know. They didn't follow us, OK? They didn't follow us. It doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't they follow us? I don't know! There was three of them, and they didn't even move! I want to go home. Sandra. Sandra, Sandra, we can do this, OK? We can get out of here. You have got this, OK? , Now come on, let's go. If I'm right, we'll be out of here soon. Come on. Follow the trail, remember? [flies buzzing] [owl hooting] [crickets chirping] [night sounds] It's really dark. Ana, who's doing this to us? Just try to stay focused. Let's not worry about that right now. So how big do you think this place is? And when are we going to get out of here? You said we'd be out of here soon! I don't know! We should have seen something by now! Maybe we're not too far. There has to be some reasoning for this. Dad's pictures, the ring? It's probably from his fucking religion. Witchcraft? Something like that. Or some other evil shit. Maybe some sort of cult. It's just, it doesn't make any sense. Out of all places, we end up here. How? I just don't want to be here, Ana. We just have to keep moving. Come on, come on. [ominous music] [wind blowing] I'm not going through there. We have to keep moving. No, I'm done listening to you and to your plans. Fine. Stay here then. I'll go first. Are you joking? I can't stay here alone. Sandra, we have to keep moving. Follow the trail, remember? [ominous music] How do you think this got here? My guess is as good as yours. This is definitely witchcraft! Come on, we have to keep moving. What was that verse that Dad liked to say about the Bible? About these things. You know it. They have mouths but you cannot speak. Yeah, that one. Say it, say it, say it. Eyes but they cannot see. They have mouths but the cannot breathe. Keep on, keep on, keep on. They have ears but they cannot hear. And where's the fucking liver? Sh, sh, sh. What? Sh, sh, sh. What? Don't talk. Don't talk. That's all. I think I heard something. What? [chanting] [ominous sounds] They're here. They're here, Ana! They're here! Run! [ominous banging] [ominous crescendo building] Ow, Ana! Ow! They got me! Ana, help me! Ana! Ana, help me, Ana! Ana, don't leave me! Ana! Ana, come and help me! [scary night sounds] Ana. [ominous music] [crying] [whispering] Ah! [crickets chirping] Ana! Ana! Papa? Ana! Papa? Where are you? Papa? Ana! Ana! Papa! Help me! Papa! Ana! Ana? Papa? Ana, help me. Who are you? Who are you? Tell me! [laughter] [music building] [ominous drums and music] [whispering voices] Go away. I can't see. [whispering voices] I can't hear. I cannot hear. Lord, [inaudible]. [music crescendo building up] [thunder] [drums beating] Hello? Hello? [screaming] Ooh, [gurgling sounds] [whispering voices] [dragging sounds] Please. Breathe. Breathe. [drums beating] [ominous crescendo building] [whispering voices] [crickets chirping] [chanting] [fire crackling] [ominous music] Help me! [sobbing] Please, help me. Help me. Wakey, wakey. What the eff? Help me. You have no idea how long I've been wanting to see that look on your face as you bleed to death. Help me. You don't make it easy on me. But, I see you let me drive at some point. And finding this place without a GPS? Help me! Don't cry. You'll be OK. I don't know. Follow the trails, really? You're so predictable. I knew exactly what you were going to say. Help me. Help me. Because Dad showed you that, right? Untie me. You know, I bet you had great time with Dad, while I was in an orphanage, crying alone! [sobbing] And that gas station, did we really have to stop there? His blood is on your hands. And to think that our plan was almost ruined. What was it, Larry? Sinners get punished. Help me! And I'm about to finish what Dad didn't do. Something he was so weak to do. Sandra. Sandra, please. Sandra! [sobbing] Let us begin. No! [speaking latin] Sandra, help me. [speaking latin] Please, somebody, help me. [speaking latin] Help me! [speaking latin] Help! [speaking latin] Great, great, Yeezus. We thank you for this vessel, and for bringing us blessings. May the sacrifice be deemed worthy in your eyes. And with this act, may our curse be lifted, and prosperity shine bright in our glorious lives! Please, please. Sandra, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you like my ring? Now it's me leaving you behind. Sandra! Sandra! Sandra? Sandra! I love you. Sandra! [screaming] [ominous music] Sandra? Sandra! Help me! Sandra! Sandra! Sandra, stop. This is sick! [crying] [music playing]
