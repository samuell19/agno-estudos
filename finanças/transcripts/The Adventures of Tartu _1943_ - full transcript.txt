[MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: You try to detonate a head, time combination of late action tumbler not tripped. Repeat. -Time combination of late action tumbler not tripped. MAN: Right. You type mountings, security trip. Now removing security pin. -Mister, who are you talking to? -Benjamin, Danny. Telling them what I'm doing. And if I do anything silly, they can tell the next man where I went wrong. -Why can't you tell him yourself? -Quiet Danny, still as a mouse. Removing pin. Pin removed, detonator hasn't come away. This is-- removing detonator. Detonator removed. [SIGHS] -All over? -All over. Operation successful. MAN: Well, Sergeant, good work. -Here's the captain now. -From the war office, sir. It's very urgent. -Give me my coat! -Yes sir. -Sorry, Sergeant. You meant to carry along? Brock has to want me for some reason or other. Good luck. -Thank you, sir. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Capt. Stevenson, sir. Now I'm Perry, this is Gen. Weymouth. -How do you do? -How do you do, sir. -Have a cigarette. -Thank you. PERRY: Well Stevenson, before we begin, just let me know if we got this right. Your father was Col. Lawrence Stevenson. -That's right, killed in 1916, in the war. -Yes, before that, as a civilian, he was consulting chemist to the oil refineries in Ploiesti, in Romania. You grew up there. You were born there. -Yes, and I came to England for school when I was 15. -After you left school, you spent two years in Germany. The, uh, Berlin University. Chemical engineering. -Yes. -Ah, well now, don't you think it's about time that we, uh, you told Capt. Stevenson why we asked him to come and see us? -Yes. -Well Stevenson, the fact is the Nazis are making poison gas on a huge scale in a new factory. -In Czechoslovakia, somewhere near Pilsen. We've reason to believe they're using a new formula-- fog gas. Now we want to know exactly what they're making and stop them making it. In other words, we want someone to get hold of the formula then blow the whole place to blazes before they get a chance to distribute the stuff. Which might be at any moment. PERRY: You speak German fluently and Romanian like a native. -Yes. -You're a chemical expert. And as things are at the moment, you could get in through Romania. -I'm afraid all I know about spying has been picked up from one or two rather second class novels. -This is a sabotage job. -And a pretty long shot whatever way you look at it. No one would blame you if you don't think you're up to it. -When would you want to start there? -Tonight. [AIRPLANE ENGINE] -I better get ready! (ROMANIAN ACCENT) Believe you have nothing to fear. I am discretion itself. Our love will be like a secret symphony. I am not begging for garters, locks of hair. No. Just give me some simple little thing with nothing personal about it at all. You know, gold cigarette case, cuff links, Rolls Royce? You know, just some simple little thing. (WITHOUT ACCENT) How's that? How am I doing? (WITHOUT ACCENT) How's that? How am I doing? -Grand. -Grand. Romanian Iron Guard of the lightning. An officer but not a gentleman. How well I know him. -If you stay in Romania, you'd make a very good living. -Thank you very much. -Here's some more about yourself. STEVENSON: Jan Tartu. Hm. Enterprising chap, aren't I? By the way, what happened to the real Tartu? -He met with a fatal accident. -Hm. You fellows have been busy. -Here are Jan Tartu's papers. Membership card of the Romanian Iron Guard. Until you cross the border into Hungary, this passport describes you as a Greek merchant. A mythical character. -Am I all right as a Greek merchant? -Well, you will be when you get your overcoat on. Don't worry, you're all right. Until you cross into Hungary, everything's fixed for you. But once you cross the border into Hungary, you must destroy that Greek passport. Then present yourself to the German consul at Szeged. -Szeged. -Tell the name Muller, Dr. Muller. -Dr. Muller. -Now you must get your visa to Czechoslovakia from him. We'll be standing by tomorrow night at the range. Manage to get on, or we can't be much use to you. -I must struggle along on my own, eh? -Yes. Think it's going to be too easy. One last memory. I don't want to take any unnecessary chances. The whole thing is one big chance. Now when you finally get to Pilsen, the man you contact is-- -Peter Valek, the shoemaker. -His address? -38 Reichstrasse. -Good. Now remember, he's our only Romanian contact in the Czech underground. So you realize his importance. -Quite. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DR. MULLER: Who is there? -(ROMANIAN ACCENT) Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. What is it. What is it. -Friend of the Reich, Dr. Muller. DR. MULLER: Yes, yes yes. -Please, please. Let me in. They're on my heels. Please! Why do you wait? -All right, all right, all right. Friend of the Reich, huh? -Yes. -I need proof of that. -Proof. Please. Romanian, huh. -I ran the border. The Hungarian patrol was deep [INAUDIBLE] than my own people if they caught me. No. They tried! I got one with a broken door. -Come with me. -But if they should see me come here, they were on my heels! -This house is German territory. -Ah. Please? Heil Hitler! -Heil Hitler. Your papers. Romanian Iron Guard. Your rank, division, battalion? -Captain, Second Division, Bucharest Battalion. -Who sent you here to me? -Col. Von Vetter, at your legation in Bucharest. You have his letter there. -Mm. There's some nice things about you. But damaging to the Reich if it should fall into the wrong hands. Strange that he should to carry across two borders when you could have used the telephone. -Maybe he thought the telephone unwise. -Maybe. Sit down. The German legation, Bucharest. Dr. Muller, consul speaking. You know Col. Von Vetter well? -Oh, but of course, of course. Like a brother. All these months we worked together. I You really think that is necessary? -I do. Does it bother you? -No, no. Not in the least. I'm only worried that you should go to some unnecessary trouble on my behalf. -Don't you worry about that. Where do you intend to go from here? -Well, Von Vetter thought I could be of use in one of the munitions or chemical plants. He thought I could be of great use. They need skilled men, I am skilled man. And a skilled chemist. My only wish is to serve the Fuhrer. Heil Hitler. Von Vetter thought you could give me a Czechoslovakian visa and recommend me to the authorities in-- -Hello, is that Col. Von Vetter? This is Heinrich Muller, Consul at Szeged, Hungary. Yes, Szeged. What? I can't hear you clearly. Well, I'm sorry, Colonel, to get you out of bed. But this seems important. I have a man here, an escaped Iron Guard. Jan Tartu. Did you give him a letter to deliver to me? Yes? He's here now. Oh. Then you did give him a letter. I'm sorry, Colonel, yes I should have rung you in the morning. But it seemed so important. I assure you Colonel, I'm very sorry. I'm sorry, Colonel. (GERMAN ACCENT) Do everything you can for him. Good. (ENGLISH ACCENT) He's still there. -You sounded like Dr. Goebbels. -Come on, let's wind up and get out of here. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. -Can you repair this shoe, while I wait. -I hope so. If you'll repair [INAUDIBLE] from an old man. -Old man. Ho ho. No women poking about in your old age. No family, hm? Well I too wander lonely as a cloud. -It floats on high all days and [INAUDIBLE]. -I know [INAUDIBLE] -Of course, those golden daffodils. You're alone here. Where are you from? -Lakefield, Bucharest. -Your mission? -The new gas plant. I shall need help from the underground. -The Reich. -Eh, this shoe, it's splitting here. You, repair it. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. [GROANS] -In the name of the Reich I arrest you. -What for? -Treason. What are you doing? Your papers. -Capt. Jan Tartu, Iron Guard of Roumania. -So, what are you doing here? -I needed a shoemaker. -Well at least I shall never have to touch the feet of any more like you! [SCREAMS] -Take him out. What's wrong with you? -If anyone has to admit, he has a certain courage. -It will be drained from him to the last drop. -Good. -I see you have not yet registered. Go to police headquarters immediately. -Certainly sir. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. -Permit for work. Permit for food, permit for clothing. Police identity card. No sense to lose them. Orderly. Room at the Palacek house. You will report to INSP Vogel, who also lives there. -A foreman? At the Skoda works? -Correct. -Well, that is ridiculous. -Ridiculous? What do you mean? -I am not an ordinary munition worker. I tell you. All my life I've worked in chemistry. It is not much, I ask not much. To serve the Fuhrer in the best way I can. That is only common sense, that is only reasonable. I am an expert but an expert only at chemistry. -You will work where you are told. That is party for us. -I have only one wish-- to serve the Fuhrer. Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. Don't worry, Tartu. You'll have an easy time working with the Czechs. Every now and then, some of them try and interfere with production. Keep your eyes open. And you will be well rewarded. I can promise you that. That's all. -Thank you. Yes, I will keep my eyes open. Yes, I can promise you that. -Sound your horn. [HORN BEEPING] -Someone important, hm? -Gen. Von Kreizer, commandant of this area. -Oh-ho. Heil Hitler! -Good morning. -This is Capt. Tartu. He is billeted here. -We have no more room. -He will occupy your room. You will move into the kitchen. And be quick about it! I'll tell INSP Vogel you are here, sir. -Do no bother to remove your things. I will take the kitchen. -Oh, but the soldier ordered-- -The soldier, pfft. I will take the responsibility. -That is very kind of you. -Not at all. If your room suited me, I should take it, oh yes. But it has no private entrance. And likewise, no private exit. At the kitchen there is a back door. Well, I am-- though I need hardly tell you, you've only to look at me. I am a man for the ladies. Or rather, the ladies are for me. And with a lady, a back door, she comes, she goes. And in the whole, wide world nobody knows. Very helpful, very encouraging. You understand. Mm, no. Perhaps you have forgotten. [CAR HORN] Our patient general-- perhaps impatient-- is waiting for someone who lives here? -Maruschka Lanova. Her room is upstairs. -A woman? Is she beautiful? -The German officers all think so. -A countrywoman of yours? A Czech. -She has found it convenient to forget her country. I'll take you to the kitchen. -Ah, Capt. Tartu. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. They called me from headquarters. I'm to take you to the Skoda works. I'm at your service. -And I at yours. MARUSCHKA: Anna, Anna! Anna Palacek. What have you got to say for yourself? -Sorry, I don't know what you mean. -Don't stand there flapping your tongue about, answer me. Why haven't these boots been saddle-soaped. And don't tell me you can't get any, because I can very easily have some wrung out of your hide. -Maruschka, wonderful. You're just as beautiful when you're angry as when you're pleased. -Thank you, Otto. How charming. -Pardon me, Capt. Jan Tartu of the Romanian Iron Guard. The inspector omitted to introduce me. I can well understand, his attention was elsewhere. But I would go further than he. For me, your anger is not only beautiful, it is a burning flame. In itself a fitting symbol of the new order. -Really, Captain. Your words are as fantastic as your clothes. -Maruschka, Are you having coffee with me this afternoon? -I'm sorry, Otto. -What about dinner then, tonight? There's a new orchestra at the [INAUDIBLE]. -My time is not entirely my own. Will you ask me again? -Of course. -Will you Otto? -Of course. -Who would not be a commandant? -My orders are to take you to the works. Are you ready? -Perfect. Fantastic. -What? -What she said about my clothes-- fantastic. Perhaps in this country they will seem a little strange. What do you think? For me, I must always be well-dressed. Funeral, just a simple little suit. You think I could wear something else? -At the works you'll get a uniform. -Good. I'm always at my best in a uniform. Good. I'm ready. GERMAN OFFICER: Now the workers in this room operate on a 12 hour shift. I needn't tell you that you must work at maximum efficiency. They're the born laggards. -They look it. [ALARM] -What is happening? -Someone has been depicted as sabotage. -One of them is a counterfeiter. -I see. Where did you get it? Who made it? You realize what this means for you? Of course, if you have any accomplices here, whose names you might care to tell, things might go easier for you. Take her away. Hopelessly stupid. None of them ever tell. How many have been through? FOREMAN: About 600, sir. -Put them away, they're useless. FOREMAN: And the plates were too late-- they are gone. -Check every shell on this line before resuming your production. FOREMAN: Yes sir. -How will you deal with her? She'll be shot immediately. All right? She lives at the house. A daughter of the Palacek woman. -Attractive, oh yes, very. But not to be compared with the other. There is something about a beautiful woman in a riding habit. -Captain, I think it would be a good thing for all concerned if I give you some advice. There is a rule, a strict rule, that party members should not fraternize with Czech women. -No? Then this morning, the commandant, he breaks the rule. -You force me to be blunt. -My dear Vogel, I don't force you. You are blunt. -Keep off Maruschka. -You mean the commandant might be annoyed? Or perhaps the inspector? [SHOT FIRED] [SCREAMING] -Inspector, at least there's one less left to argue about. -Mm, smells good. What is it? -Veal paprika. -Ah, I shall look forward! -[INAUDIBLE] [POUNDING ON DOOR] -How many women live in this house? -Three. -Who are they? -Myself, my daughter and Maruschka Lanova is all. -Are they in now? -Why, only my daughter. Maruschka Lanova has not yet returned. -How long has your daughter been here? -I don't know, I-- -May I be of assistance? Capt. Jan Tartu, Romanian Iron Guard. Now foreman of the Skoda works. What has happened? -A German officer has been killed nearby in the Kesslerplatz. A few minutes ago. -Murdered? -By some woman. She was seen running away. -Escape? -So fast. I ask you. How long has your daughter been in? -I, I don't know. I-- -Ah, but I know. I will bring her down. Listen. Do as I tell you. -A German officer-- -Yes, I've searched everybody. What have you? TARTU: You Czechs think you can do what you like. But this-- -You stay with the woman. TARTU: Don't think you can hide anything from me, my girl. No! I give you that it's impossible! I assure you I can search your room. You Czechs have got to be forced to cooperate. An officer of the Reich has been murdered. And if you have a gun here-- -Never mind, Romanian. I'll handle this. How long have you been in the house. -About half an hour. TARTU: That's right, I saw her. But she came in through the back door. -I often come in by the kitchen. -Are you sure she came in half an hour ago? -I am certain of it. And now that I remember Major, she had a funny look on her face. -I congratulate you, Captain. Your powers of discernment are remarkable. But your memory is faulty. Didn't you hear us say that this murder took place less than 15 minutes ago? -Yes? What? Are you sure? -Capt. Tartu will never be a candidate for our military intelligence. [LAUGHTER] -All the same, don't you ever dare tell a member of the party that he can't search your room. -I suggest you spend your first evening studying what's contained in those. Party programs, behavior, future aims. All that interpreted by the Fuhrer himself. [SPEAKING GERMAN] -If anyone calls, I've gone to the council meeting at the Barhopf. -Yes. -Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. I think our fuhrer must use as many pencils as he does men. -You saved my life. But I don't understand why. -I shall always owe you mine. -In times like these, you never know who your friends are. -Who are you? -I'm here on a mission. I've come a long way, and that's all I can tell you. -Afterwards, when you're done. -Paula, you can help me. You must know other Czechs have pledged loyalty to us. I must contact the underground, you understand? -The underground? -Yes. I can't tell you how-- You can. -I don't know, I-- I'll see what I can do. [DOOR CLOSING] -Oh, so you're home for once. Come upstairs and take my boots off. -This Maruschka, tell me something about her. -She boards here. --She seems a girl of means, though. Of education. -Her father owned a big textile factory. My husband works for him. -Is her father alive? -He and my husband are both dead. -Oh I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. But this intimacy with high ranking German officers-- rather a stranger transfer of affections, don't you think? -Some women are loyal only to their own breed, Captain. PAULA: Yes, yes, I will. I can't talk now. She wants to see you. -Maruschka? -Yes, up in her room. -Now? -Yes. -Command performance, eh? Well, well, what's one to do? [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in. -Fraulein. -Well, Capt. Tartu. -Never have I climbed stairs with greater anticipation. -I see you're incorrigible. Have a cigarette and give me one, will you? -Please. -Thank you. Sit down, Captain. I detest being forced into apologies, but it seems I owe you one. -I can hardly believe my ears. Not only beautiful, but unexpected. A woman of surprises. It is too much, too much. -Well, Gen. Von Kreizer, the commandant? -I know. -He was telling me of the work of your Iron Guard in Romania. Very clever. And very courageous. I don't think you warranted my rudeness, so hereby I apologize. -And hereby I accept your apology. And what is more, I too can be generous. There was, I admit it, something in what you said. You are a woman of taste. -No, just bad-tempered. -No, no. A woman of taste. You like me better as I am now, yes? -Infinitely. -Ah, but I see doubt and misgiving and shadow in those eyes. I know! The pomade. Yes. Never again do I soil myself with the pomade. From now on it is an offense. Never shall it be said that Capt. Tartu relied on the hair oil. No. You shall see me as I am-- almost. -Almost? Why not quite? -Who knows? It is possible we shall see. -What on earth is that? -Your dinner. -Dinner? Water, milk, and dried up cheese. Where's that veal paprika? -But-- MARUSCHKA: More wine, you stupid. Get it out of here before I'm sick. What a way to live. Well, seems like I'll have to go elsewhere for my dinner. -Will you give me the pleasure of taking you? -Why, yes. In fact, I rather hoped you'd ask me. Can I have half an hour to get dressed? -Nothing could be better. For in that half hour, I too have most important business. -Can I ask what? -I have to remove the pomade. Heil Hitler. No? -No. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Why? -I feel in the mood for talk, for real talk. An exchange of confidences, of hopes and fears. This helps. -Oh, you've done a lot of talking. You've told me the life story of Jan Tartu. -What do you think of it? -Shall I tell you the truth? -Please. -I don't know what to think. It's very highly colored, but men will do desperate things out of love for their country. -Or for their faith in the new order. -Why yes, of course. -Or for their-- love of freedom. -Though, Capt. Tartu, without the pomade there's something very different about you. -Away from Vogel and the commandant I would say the same about you. -My family have lost everything, and owned much. I want to get it back. That's why I risk my reputation with our German visitors. -You risk something of your reputation as a good Nazi, your little plot with Paula. -Plot? -Mm. There was a whole potful of veal paprika in the kitchen. And you knew it. And Pavla knew you knew it. I'm not such a fool as-- as Capt. Tartu sometimes appears. -You may take me into the moonlight. -Paula told you everything? -Everything she knew. Who are you? -Not yet. You know Peter Valek, the shoemaker? -There are many shoemakers. -He was my only contact. -You know, you're taking a big chance on me. -I'm taking a chance on what's behind your eyes. Look at me. Will you do the same with me? -My country is being tortured to death. If I were to do anything to increase that suffering-- -I'm here to help. You must believe that. -You want me to put you in touch with the underground? -As soon as possible. -Tomorrow. When you return from work. [MUFFLED CRYING] -Paula, darling, darling, don't. Don't cry. Couldn't you sleep? I couldn't get back sooner. That fool Otto turned up. -I [INAUDIBLE] It was horrible. -No, darling. -It's been over three months since [INAUDIBLE] and the others he executed. I couldn't have lived that long. -I know, darling. -That's how I got into [INAUDIBLE] today. I had [INAUDIBLE] and a revolver. And he fell right in the gutter. Right on his face in the filth. What happened about the Romanian? -You were right about that darling. I'm going to speak to the council members in the morning. -I knew I could trust him, the moment I saw him. There's something about him. -Yes, there's something about him. He was strong, honest, gentle at the same time. -Maruschka, I never heard you talk about a man like that before. What happened? So falling in love. -Am I? Yes, I think I am. -You know when you are. I remember Carl. You killed the man who killed my Carl. But that hasn't brought Carl back to me. Killing, killing, killing-- there's nothing left. Nothing. [CRYING] -Paula darling. Darling. There. -Do your sleeping at home. [ALARM] -Yeah, what is it? -One moment, Lieutenant. -Turn me in. Come on. So, you're a young thing. -I've failed, but others will carry on. -Keep her here. -Captain, the guard is certain that with Tartu here-- -The door. It is open. May we have it closed? -Shut it. -Thank you. Yes, it was Paula Palacek. She had that bag in her hand. -What did you find in it? -Two burned out [INAUDIBLE]. -Why didn't you say so out there? -But Lieutenant, isn't it obvious? Captain, surely you understand. But it is so plain! Already they begin to trust me. The work that I was sent here to do, it will go on. (WHISPERING) But if these Czechs were ever to suspect that it was their new friend, Capt. Tartu who gave this girl away-- Well, surely, now Captain. A man of your intelligence must see-- -Yes, of course. Quite right. Good work, Captain. -This won't be made public, I hope? -Of course not. What do you take me for. Start your machines again. Have the girl shot. -Yes sir. -Oh, Tartu. -Yes? -You seem very quick winded for a Romanian. -Oh, as I told him when I first came here, but not all are as quick as you. Even in the party. I am not an ordinary munitions worker. No, no. I'm a graduate chemist. -Is that so? Chemist, eh? Well, I don't see what can be done. That is all. [SHOT FIRED] -Good afternoon, how's your headache? -Frightful. I didn't sleep a wink all night. So don't tell me I have to wait, because I made an appointment early this morning. -Dr. Novotny will see you now. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, Doctor. -Come in. -Please, sit down. -I understand you spent again. Anything to tell us? -Nothing yet. Every time I brought up the subject of the new airdrome, he avoided it, very obviously. -Then why call the meeting? -I wanted to speak to the council because I feel I have something much more important. It concerns a man named Tartu, Jan Tartu. -Tartu? -Well then you know him. -We know he is living in the Palacek house. -Yes, and he's a friend, Dr. Novotny. Yesterday, when they came to see Paula, he hid the gun. Saved her life. He's on a very important mission. He wants to contact the underground. -You didn't tell him about us. -Oh, no. Naturally not. I only obey orders. But I want permission to bring him here. -What makes you so sure of him, Maruschka? -Why, I told you. He saved Paula's life. Oh yes, he mentioned Peter Valek. And then, well, I've seen so much of the other kind I'm not entirely insensible to honesty and sincerity when I do meet it. -Did you know Peter Valek was executed yesterday? -No! -When did you last see Paula Palacek? -This morning. -This afternoon she was shot. -Paula? No! Oh no. -Come in. Tell Maruschka how Paula was discovered. -The foreman came and told the head officer. He said he wanted to report her. DR. NOVOTNY: Why? -He said he was gaining the confidence of certain Czechs. That the work that he was sent to do was going forward. And that it would spoil his plans if it was known that he had reported her. -What was the foreman's name? -Jan Tartu. -That's all, thank you. -I might just as well have killed her myself. -You were caught by the oldest trick, my dear. He pretended to save Paula in order to get at the rest of us. -I'll do anything to see him dead. Anything. -It would be excellent to have him out of the way. -You must be careful. They are taking hostages. From now on anymore killings and 100 of our people, 200 even would die in return. -If that is so, forgive my putting it bluntly. Are we wise to trust this case to someone who has already allowed her sex to influence her judgement? DR. NOVOTNY: I have known Maruschka Lanova since she was born. The mistake she has made over this man will make her more careful from now on. Besides, you are on pretty intimate terms with him. -I can do anything I like with him. -Very useful, that virtue of necessity. -You can trust me absolutely to eliminate Capt. Tartu. Anna! --[INTERPOSING VOICES] --[INAUDIBLE] -No. Novotny just told us. For every Nazi killed, 200 Czechs will die. -That will be [INAUDIBLE]. -But it wouldn't do any good, darling. Novotny asked me how I was going to do it. I said I didn't know. I didn't then. I do now. He'll be done away with by one of his own kind. One stinking coward destroys another, Anna. And nobody's the wiser. [DOOR OPENING] I'll be back. -Yes? MARUSCHKA: Are you dressed? -Maruschka! -Can we talk somewhere? -Yes, come in. -Is this respectable, Otto? I think I refused to come in here last night, for some such reason. [LAUGHTER] -A girl can change her mind, eh? Your hat is pretty. But you might like to take it off, huh? -Well, let me get my breath. This is a very restful [INAUDIBLE]. -Now, sent from home. -Mm. I bet this didn't come from home. -That? Ho, ho. That came from the finest art collection at Pilsen. -Borrowed, for the duration. -Yes. Of my life. Maruschka, to your being here, in my room. -To the success of my being here. -Maruschka-- -I said, to the success of my being here, Otto. Otto, I need your help. I need it badly. And I know you're one I can trust. -Always, Maruschka. In any way. -You know I want to get back with my family home, after the war. -I know, darling, but there's something I-- -And I know you have a party career in mind. Obviously a man of your ability doesn't expect to remain a mere inspector. -Oh, I've planned ahead-- -We must realize both our ambitions, Otto. If you'll help me with a certain individual, by the name of Jan Tartu. -Tartu? What's he-- -I think he's a spy. -What? -I'm sure of it. -You know, Maruschka. You must be careful. He's of the Romanian Iron Guard. The party's feelings, their hopes. He came with credentials. -Iron Guard. I doubt he even comes from Romania. -No? What makes you think that? -I don't know. There's an underground group here of some sort working against the righteous of us? -Yes, yes, go on. -Well, last night at the casino, he hinted he was trying to contact them. To get their help. -Help? For what? -Otto, when a man wants the help of an underground movement, it can't be for the good of the Reich. -Oh, yes. -Now I didn't say anything last night to you. That was why I was so easy with him. I wanted to see if he'd mention it to me again this morning. -Well, did he? -Just as I was coming out of my room. He suggested that this girl in the house. This, this Paula-- Oh yes, I understand she was shot today. Sabotage where she works, or something. -Yes, yes. But never mind about her. -All right. He practically said he knew I was her friend and that we could do something for her with the underground, or whatever it is they call themselves. -Oh. This is serious. Well, we can easily prove the [INAUDIBLE]. -How? -Call the gestapo and tell them to check up on him. -No, no, Otto! -Huh? -Not when we can get all the credit ourselves. -But how? -Come on, darling. You can use this, can't you? -Yes, but-- I've got to be sure. -I want to arrange some little meeting. Perhaps he was in the garden last night, you were behind a hedge. We'd get him ourselves. -Then what? -I scream. You shoot. You and I are both there to testify. An enemy of the Reich lies there. -I see. -I get what I want, and-- maybe they'll make you general or something. -Very clever, Maruschka. When can you meet him again? -Tonight. -Where? -At the cafe where we were last night. -I'll be there. -There may be people around. -All for the good. More convincing. You know the [INAUDIBLE]? -Yes. -Take him there. I'll make arrangements. I'll be able to hear everything he says. -Mm. Darling, you're a genius. And Otto-- -Huh? -You know what else might happen for us, if we're successful? -What? -Next time I come in this room I might even take off my hat. -The Romanian again, eh? -I'm sorry to be late, but it's been a hard day. Paula. -Yes. -You knew then? -Yes. She looked at me when they led her away. I'll never forget that look, never. I know, I know how close you were to her. -[INAUDIBLE] -I can't let you know. Later I will. And I've other things to tell you, things that can't be told until my job's done. Do you have anything useful? -Well, I didn't tell you last night, but I'm not a member of this underground group myself. Frankly, I don't think they're ready to trust you yet. -What? -But I was sure Paula was. And I thought through Paula I could-- but now, -Do you know anyone else? -Well, I have to be very careful. -Oh, I realize that. But it's more important than ever now. Things are coming to a head. I'm being transferred to the new gas laboratory tomorrow. -I'm sorry, darling. But I'll work as fast as I can. -Of course. Of course. -But do let us enjoy being together. -Yes. Where would you like to sit? -Over there? Shall we? -Eh-- just to prove I sometimes think of you as something more than an accomplice. Just for the purpose of waiting. Waiting [INAUDIBLE]. -It's lovely. [HUMMING] Ah, that's better. That's much better. I've always liked this tune. [SINGING] -You're singing the words. -Mm-hm. -They're German. -Yes, written years ago. That sort of music is universal. -Strange. They tell me that's one of the Fuhrer's favorite waltzes. -Oh, well, if that music could speak, I'm sure it would object. -[INAUDIBLE] -Well I don't want to spend a lot of time hating him. After all, most of us are working 24 hours a day to get rid of him. -I like to hear you say that. Tell me more of what you're doing to get rid of him. I want to hear. -Hm? -I want to hear it from you. -All officers report to me. -Trouble, I'm afraid. [SIGHS] Oh, don't worry. -And I'm certain that rotten Czech elements of the local population will be examined for their passes, papers, and concealed weapons. On the will of command, all Czechs will collect in the center of the floor. Attention! Czechs! March! Halt! [SHOT FIRED] [SCREAMING] GERMAN OFFICER: Take him away! [GERMAN SINGING] -Heil Hitler! -Heil Hitler! -Hello? -I got mixed up with a lot of Nazis. Had to do my turn. -I understand. -See you tomorrow? -Of course. -I'll be at the works for all day. -Jan? -Hm? -We'll meet at the same place? Same time? -Wonderful. I am looking forward. -So am I. -Good night, darling. -Good night. -There you are, Captain. -Where is the gas plant? -It's built inside the hill. -Walk through the farmhouse, and you'll find it. -Jan Tartu reporting for the-- [INAUDIBLE]. -You put your personal effects and valuable things here. You can't take anything in there. -Javol. -Your number is 82. -Thank you. -Is that everything? -Everything. -Tie pin. -Oh, yes. -Take him to Dr. Willendorf, first medal. Dr. Willendorf is expecting you. -It is an honor. -This way please. [BELL RINGING] -What is wrong? -You have forgotten something. -Hm? Forgotten? -Electric ray. It says you have some steel on you. -Metal? Hm? Ah. [BELL RINGING] -I hate to part with it. I only met her yesterday. -Oh? She gave you some those things, huh? -Lovely things, lovely things. Most hospitable. She lives with a younger sister. -Is [INAUDIBLE] -Capital. But, he's going to part in a couple of days. -See you later, huh? -Guard it with your life. -This way please. If there is an air raid alarm, follow the signs. Wait here, I'll find Dr. Willendorf. Dr. Willendorf? Capt. Tartu, Dr. Willendorf. Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. -Come with me. -Who is this? -My new chemist Tartu. Capt. Von Felig. -Well? What are you waiting for? -[INAUDIBLE] the Fuhrer. Heil Hitler. -Tartu! -Gas to report? -Follow them to my own specifications. I want to know your business, my friend. We are [INAUDIBLE] an emergency schedule here. -I'm quite confident. -You have heard [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh yes. For some two or three [INAUDIBLE] under Professor Bruner. -This way. You will find we are making an amazing gas here, Tartu. Start by learning the formula thoroughly. -I didn't see any bomb casings out there, Dr. Willendorf. Are they filled on another river? -No. We ship the gas to the various [INAUDIBLE] in two separate liquid forms. There the liquid gas is [INAUDIBLE], and the bomb casing is capped just prior to operation. What gets that stuck in your head as quickly as possible. I am very pleased with you, Tartu. -Thank you sir. Your new gas is more than amazing. It is almost inconceivable in its deadliness. -And it will be put to good use. I would like you to come one hour earlier in the morning, please. -Certainly. -All day tomorrow we shall be running final tests, and I shall need your assistance. -Final test? You're not ready with your first shipment, are you? -A full week ahead of time. Tomorrow night we will be loading it onto the truck. And soon on some beautifully clouded evening, it will be unloaded-- on England. Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. Maruschka! Where's Maruschka? -Out. The commandant called unexpectedly to take her to dinner. She told me to tell you that only that could keep her. -Where did they go? Do you know? -No. Is there no way at all that I can contact her? -No. -Can't you get a message through to her? -No. -Look here. I've got to do something tonight. Is there any chance. Can't you help? -I can get you some supper. -Waiter, waiter. -[INAUDIBLE] -How much have I been sitting? I want to get out of this-- -Yes sir. -Who asked for that? Give me another brandy, quick. Hm, you seem a pleasant enough sort of fellow. How about letting me buy you a drink? -Thank you. -Why not? -This is my limit for this evening. Think you're at the same. -Brandy, sir. -Sir, you Czechs. Think yourselves pretty smart, don't you? Won't fraternize. Waiting for the hour when you're going to rise up and throw us out, eh? Well, who's going to lead you? Tell me that! Some of those amateur heroes of yours that you've got hidden away in that underground army? All right, don't talk. But they are not going to lead you. I can tell you that. Why? Because they won't be able to rise out of their graves. That's why. I know six of the rats were going to be smoked out by the end of the week. Six! The gestapo's got them in. Do you know why I know? Because I happen to be-- maybe I'm talking too much. Hey, you! Have a brandy, quick. -Coming sir. -There is plenty of things I can tell you. Plenty of things. One of you must be pretty good at ice hockey. But if you're the people I think you are, it was worth it. -Tonight you said you knew some of the names of Czechs on the gestapo's list. -Yes. -We want to know who they are. -Believe me, I don't know them. I only talked like that in the last hope of making contact with the underground. And I think I have, haven't I? -Supposing you have. -I'm a British secret agent, gentlemen. I need your help desperately. -We need more proof than merely your word for it. -But that's all I can give you. Peter Valek-- he was about to put me in touch with you when they caught him. My job is a very big one. I'm here to wreck their new gas plant. I'm working there now. But I must have help. Chemicals to make bombs. Men to help make them. Tonight! Now! They're shipping the first batch of gas tomorrow. You must believe me. You think I'd be mad enough to take this chance if the situation wasn't of the greatest-- -One moment. You informed on the Palacek girl. Why? -I had to. They knew I'd seen her do it. And she knew they'd seen me. If you ever erect a monument to Czech patriotism, that girl's name should be carved in letters as high-- -What is your real name? -Capt. Terence Stevenson, oil engineer. Now detective of special work of military intelligence. -Break him, swine. -So that's that. The gestapo, I take it. GERMAN OFFICER: Correct. -It's not a nice sensation for a man to realize he's bungled his job. I assure you. -Your little display at the bar was slightly obvious. -Evidently. Well, what now? -Hm. We do these things quickly. No formalities. At the base of the neck. -Well, do we carry on. -We're to get things ready. If you care to write a message to your family, over there. -Very kind of you. -There's also the decoding office, so don't try any tricks. Having a difficult time, huh? -It isn't easy. First time I've written this kind of letter. Once is enough. -Just a moment, please. "Dear Terry, I am sorry I have messed things up. Please let my mother know. I am sure you will be tactful. Give her my dear love. To you and all friends, all the best. Sorry to miss the victory your parents--" -I suppose you realize this is all quite futile. They knew you worked with me. It had to give them the next and the next. No matter how long it takes, a whole civilized world will keep on coming at you. Coming at you and coming again. You know that? -Why, you write letter. You made a brilliant effort to contact the underground. Congratulations-- you have! Capt. Stevenson, at your service, sir. -By Jove. -I'm Dr. Muller. I have the honor to be chairman of our comrades. -By Jove! That's the second time I've said that! [LAUGHTER] -I'm sorry we had to be so strenuous. But you can understand, I'm sure. -Certainly was a convincing performance. Look here, have you got anything besides beer her? -Peter, some wine for all of us. -Oh Doctor, we mustn't waste-- -[INAUDIBLE] patients. -I shall need all the help we can give them at once. I'll [INAUDIBLE] the work. -I know. Get [INAUDIBLE]. I've left my official [INAUDIBLE]. All the help we can give you, you shall have. We have our own laboratory here in the cellar. Crude as it is. -Splendid. We'll manage. Beautiful work. I don't know what I'd have done without your help. The most compact container of lethal product I've ever seen. We learned something, eh? -Is there enough explosive in there to blow up the entire plant? -Yes, properly placed there's enough nitrocine in these to wipe out two entire blocks. -The only thing I can understand is why we thank him. -Didn't you say you had to report an hour earlier today? -Yes. -Because it's nearly 7 o'clock. -Thank you. Our timetable worked out perfectly. These are set to go off at exactly 12:15. That gives me just 15 minutes after noon to drop them off and clear out. -And [INAUDIBLE] will be in the be in the car by the south field. -And I'll have the door open. -Good, if you don't, you'll have to expect the person through the window. -Morning, Lieutenant. I shall have to hurry, I'm late. -Well, Tartu. I have been waiting. Have you any news for me? -Pithy-- see you in the lunch hour. [BELL RINGING] Same old sabotage. Tonight we use this, together. -Aha. VOGEL: Ah, Maruschka. Maruschka, come, come in here. -Something serious? -Serious? Wait until I put through a call and you'll see. Hello? INSP Vogel speaking, give me Tartu. Get me Col. Von Vetter, legation Bucharest. Yes, that's it. -What is this little drama all about? -When I got to headquarters this morning, I heard that Tartu is now working at the new gas factory. -Yes, he did mention that. -You know he didn't come home last night? -No, I didn't. -Oh, this is all too dangerous. We can't wait now. If anything happened, and they found out that you and I were suspicious, and hadn't reported him, why-- -Why the call to Bucharest? -I inquired about his credentials at headquarters. He came with a letter from the consul at Szeged. It was supposed to seem sent to him by Von Vetter in Bucharest. I'm going to [INAUDIBLE] now. -You really think he'll leave? [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Yes, Maruschka. Hello? Yes? I'm waiting. -(WHISPERING TO HERSELF) Then he isn't gestapo? Well, there's a chance I made a mistake. -Still waiting. -An INSP Vogel in Pilsen. -Von Vetter speaking. Tartu? That's impossible. Tartu has been dead over six months. -Ah, then he is a spy. I thought his papers were forged. That's why I checked with you, Colonel. Yes, he'll be dealt with at once. Thank you, Colonel. Heil Hitler. Ha ha. You made no mistake, my darling. You don't seem very pleased about it. -Of course I'm pleased. I don't know what all the excitement is about. I told you he was a spy, and now you find it out for yourself. -Yes. But now he's working at the gas factory. I must have him arrested, at once. Hello? -But why the gestapo? -You talked about this doing out of a [INAUDIBLE]? It will. I don't believe in waiting. Not for a moment. Hello? -Otto. -Huh? -Don't you remember what I said when I was in here last? -Maruschka. -You men. You're all alike. This is me, and it's your future. -Same thing, Maruschka. You're in my future. This won't take long. -Don't be so sure! I'm not used to being treated like this. A telephone call can wait. You might lose both me and your future, if you're not very careful. -Ha ha. I won't lose either. I've never felt so strong or full of confidence before. Hello? Don't you worry about me, darling. INSP Vogel speaking. I want the gas factory. Emergency. [THUD] -(WHISPERING) Anna, Anna! Quickly. Anna, we were wrong about Jan. -How did it happen? -I can't tell you now. We've got to save him! -There's no need to tie his hands. He is dead. [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Oh, I didn't mean-- -I wish I had murdered him. Think Maruschka, Paula, Carl, your father. He can only die once. That is a pity. -We shan't be safe here now. Go to Dr. Novotny and tell him I'll report to him as soon as possible. -Funny. An inspector was calling the gas plant, and just when he said emergency, he stopped and hung up. -Did you get the number he called from? -Yes, but when I called back there was no answer. -You'd better report it. -Yes. GERMAN OFFICER: Have you got a permit? MARUSCHKA: No, but it's very urgent. GERMAN OFFICER: Have you got a permit? MARUSCHKA: No, but I simply must get in. -Let her in. Well, Fraulein. -Hello, Lieutenant, could I possibly speak to a friend of mine? He said he works here, if he isn't lying. -Well, if you'll give me his name, I'll see whether he is or not. -Jan Tartu. -Tartu? -He'll say he's the best looking man in the place, not counting yourself. -Huh, Tartu. He certainly wasn't lying about you, Fraulein. Was he telling the truth about your sister? Didn't he mention me? Lt. Kremp? -Oh yes. So you're Lt. Kremp. Of course. Well Lieutenant, couldn't I speak to Jan, please? -Well, it's an infraction of the rules during working hours. -Oh, but you can manage it, yes? For me. -Fraulein, shall we say for your sister? -And don't be too long. -Well, well little one. -Hello. (WHISPERING) Jan. You've been discovered. Vogel called Bucharest. -When? -Now-- you've got to get out of here. They'll be coming any minute. Anything can happen. They'll be calling the gestapo. We haven't got any seconds. -I cannot. -Jan. -I can't. Maruschka, now listen carefully. Get to Dr. Novotny and tell him what's happened. All plans are off. I've got to plant those bombs now, as soon as I can. Do you understand? I've got to get the car on that road right away. -Oh Darling, no. -Is that [INAUDIBLE]? -Yes, but there isn't time. -Go ahead then, quickly, Maruschka. -Oh, Jan. I can't leave you. -(YELLING) Do as I tell you. Don't come in here bothering me again. Be off now, go on! Off you get. -Another quarrel, eh? -You have to put them in their place, now and then. [AIR RAID SIREN] [SHOUTING] -The formula, Tartu. -Does anyone know who give the alarm? -I thought you did sir! -One moment, Colonel speaking. -Where are you going? -I have orders! -Arrest Jan Tartu! -Arrest Jan Tartu! -(ECHOING) Arrest Jan Tartu! Arrest Jan Tartu! -Get Tartu the Romanian. He's a spy. You [INAUDIBLE] -Tartu, Jan! -Jan Tartu? [THUD] -There he is! [SHOOTING] [SHOOTING] -Don't shoot! [WHISTLE BLOWING] -Tartu. Now in number four of the mill. (ECHOING) Tartu. Now in number four-- [SHOUTING] [SHOOTING] [SHOUTING] [SHOOTING] [NO SHOTS FIRED] -Step on it. Have you got a gun mounted? [RUMBLING] [EXPLOSIONS] They -Are operating tonight. -How long have you got? -Less than 30 minutes. Now you have to go and stand, you must get up there and watch her come. The dawn is with us. -Are you ready? -Jan, darling. I can't come with you. -Why? -You'll always be in my heart. There's work to be done here still. DR. NOVOTNY: Nonsense. Maruschka, there's nothing more you can do for us. You're a liability in fact. So I order you to leave the country in good hands. -Oh, Doctor. -We must get [INAUDIBLE]. -Well, Doctor, words sometimes are important. -Good luck. Good bye. STEVENSON: Where are we heading for? MAN: [INAUDIBLE] STEVENSON: In a German plane? MAN: It's all right. We have prearranged the signals. [PLANE ENGINE] -Perfect. -If we don't get away on this, we'll always know, Maruschka. -Always. -Come on. [WHISTLING] -Coffee. I'll bet you all the marks in your pockets. -Hands up! Leave them up. OK! [SHOT FIRED] Get over there and face that wall. Quickly, get in there. Keep your hands up! [SHOOTING] -Keep them up! [PLANE TAXIING] [PLANE TAKING OFF] PILOT: You all right? -Fine! [WOOD SMASHING] -Airport! -They're taking off! PILOT: If we get to that cloud we will lose them! -What then? -Home! -What? -Just a simple little bedding. [THEME MUSIC]
