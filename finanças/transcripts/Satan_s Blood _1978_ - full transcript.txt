"Satan Exists, Confirms the Pope." (Professor Carlos speaking in Spanish) - [Narrator] Satan exists because evil exists. Professor Carlos Vasallo, a recognized authority on the subjects of Satanism, the occult and voodoo, worked closely with the writer and director during the development and shooting of this film to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the various rituals and incantations. The argument for Professor Vasallo's statement is really very simple. He explains it as a theory of opposites. For example, just as matter exists so does its opposite, anti-matter. The air we breathe is a mixture of positive ions and negative ions. The energy around us and also that which we generate ourselves is part positive and part negative. And so to the less tangible but perfectly feasible example good and bad, God and Satan. This last example presented man with a choice. The choice of either living by the forces of good or of evil. And history has shown that many have chosen the latter and have become Satan's disciples. Every year thousands of black masses have performed rituals that invariably include unnatural sexual acts and the sacrifice of both animals and human beings. These rituals have been practiced for hundreds of years and it would be foolish of us to ignore them or to claim that the forces they generate are simply a figment of the imagination. There are too many documented examples of occurrences that could only have been caused by forces that are far beyond the normal capabilities of man. We must assume therefore that the forces generated by any occult ritual black or white, come from the beyond and in the case of a black mass, from Satan.

Seems like the whole world is out today. - But it's a holiday. They're all out polluting the freeways. Did you call Harry? He and Barbara might still be around. - If they are, they're still in the sack. - So what interrupt his (mumbles) then. (both chuckling) And, if they're not home we can go someplace on our own. (Annie scoffs) (Blackie barks) Okay Blackie. How about we take Blackie for a run in the park? And after we can go dancing. I don't wanna stay in today. - Neither do I honey but there's no way we're going dancing. We're not risking losing this little fella. (Annie scoffs) - Yeah, how old is he now? Four months tomorrow and getting bigger. (both chuckling) (Blackie barks) - You just can't wait, can you? (both chuckling) - Good afternoon. - Hi there.

(Blackie growls) How you doing Annie? - I'm fine. - I'm afraid Andy has lost his memory. - Hello Annie, how you doing? - Great thanks. - Hey, it's sure been a while. You look the same as you did old buddy. Time's treated you pretty well. It's amazing, the last time I saw you you were no more than that high. - In college was it? - Yeah right. I had Matthews, I was in C while you were in B but we had one class together with Frank Bradshaw. - Frank Bradshaw never taught classes, he was the dean. - Hey, come on Andy. He was professor of sciences, Jesus already senile at your age. (both laughing) Where were you two off to? - We're going home. - You got children? - One in the oven. - Good man, Andy. How about we go to our place and have a drink and celebration? Okay? - Come on, it'll be fun. (Blackie barks) - Okay. - Oh, what do you say? We can catch up on the past, play a little music and relax. Just take it easy. - Oh, well I've just... - Know what I've just thought, somewhere I've got a picture from college with the two of us in it. - You guys gonna stand here and talk all day? We've got wine and cheese at home. Come on, let's go. - Follow us. (footsteps pattering) (car door clicks) (car door thuds) (car door clicks) (car door thuds) (car engine revving) (Annie exhales sharply) - Their place, you know where it is? - No idea. I don't know, I just wish the hell I could place the man, that's all. - He must have been in another class. I mean, he looks much older than you. - It's pretty weird. My mind's a blank. - So what? They seem like a very nice couple, Andy. And I mean, we didn't have anything else to do. (car engine revving) How old do you think Bruno really is? - I don't know. - I'd say late 40's. - Here we go. (car engine revving) Where the hell is their place? Frank Bradshaw was the dean of the college. I'm sure about that. The professor of sciences was a- - Hey drop it, please Andy. - Well you know how many miles we've come? - No I don't but we've been driving for the best part of an hour. (car engine revving) Why'd you stop here? - I think it's best we turn around. - But we've come this far. - Yeah and who knows, we could end up driving all night. Let's go back, it's getting late. - All right, let's go back then. (car engine revving) - Why did you turn around? We thought we'd lost you. - Well, it's getting late. - We're almost there now. - You want me to go slower? - No, it wasn't... - It's just a couple of minutes, come on, let's go. (car engine revving) (ominous music) (car engine revving) (gate creaks) (car engines revving) (gate creaks) (car engines revving) (ominous music) (car door thuds) - [Bruno] Well, here we are. - [Andy] Yeah, pretty far out of town. - [Mary] We really only come out on weekends. - [Andy] Yeah. (Blackie barks) Wait a minute, I left the key in the car. - Don't worry, nobody's gonna steal it out here. (Bruno chuckles) (Blackie continues barking) - Blackie, Blackie come on. - Why don't you leave the dog out? Let him run. - Poor old Blackie, after a week of being shut up in the apartment he gets crazy. - I'm afraid he might disappear somewhere. - No way, honey. The whole place is walled in and the gates locked. - Still if you don't mind, I'd prefer he stay with us. - [Bruno] Sure. This way. - Go ahead. (Annie chuckles) (keys jingle) (door clicks) (footsteps pattering) (metal clanking) (footsteps pattering) (liquid dripping) (cooker lid clicks) (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (switch clicks) (Annie exclaims) - [Annie] What a super room this is. - [Mary] Glad you like it. Whereabouts do you live? - In a rented matchbox. - But comfortable and very central. - One of these days we'll come and visit you. - [Andy] You're welcome to try but I don't think We'd all fit in. (Bruno chuckles) - [Bruno] I'm gonna light a fire. It's cold today. (clock ticking faintly) (footsteps pattering) - Hey, that's great. - [Andy] Need a hand? (ominous music) - [Bruno] Got a light? - [Andy] Sure. - [Bruno] Mary, pour some drinks. - [Mary] Sure, what would you like? - [Bruno] Whatever (doll squeaks) you guys are drinking. That outta do it. Hand me a log will you? (clock ticking faintly) (paper rustles) (ominous music continues) (door clicks) (paper rustles) (ominous music continues) In a minute I'll go dig out that photograph. Then you'll see how bad your memory is. (Blackie howls) (chain clanks) (Blackie barks) (footsteps pattering) (Blackie growls) - Quiet. (ominous music) (footsteps pattering) (lock clicks) (door thuds) (liquid dripping) (footsteps pattering) (lock clicks) (ominous music) (paper rustles) - [Bruno] Does the subject interest you? (Annie chuckles nervously) - I've always been curious about it. I'll go help Mary. Where do I ﬁnd the kitchen? - At the end of the corridor. - Oh, thanks. (footsteps pattering) - [Bruno] It's gotta be in here somewhere. (ominous music continues) (paper rustles) (footsteps pattering) (Mary breathes heavily) (liquid dripping) - You want something to eat? (Annie sighs) - No. I thought maybe I could help you. (liquid dripping) - Thanks honey. (footsteps pattering) (cabinet door clicks) Why don't you cut the cheese? (footsteps pattering) (liquid dripping) You know, you have very beautiful eyes Annie. (Annie sighs) - Thank you. (chopping board taps) - [Bruno] That's you here. And that's me. And that's Frank Bradshaw. See, I was right. - But these uniforms are... - I found the photograph of us Annie. - Oh let me see. (plate clanks) (Annie exclaims) (Annie laughs) - Takes us back a few years. - Angel faces. (Annie laughs) - You know I thought uniforms had been discontinued in 51 or 52. I never wore one. - No? Then what is that you're wearing? (ominous music) (footsteps pattering) (tray clanks) “Ana and Andres, 60 Pradillo Street, Apartment 65.” - How did... - [Mary] Your drink. (footsteps pattering) (fire crackles) (Annie sighs) - What kind of wine is this? - Try it, I'm sure you'll like it. (Annie exclaims) - It's a special vintage. Tell me where do you work at Andy? - Hey, aren't you two having any wine? - No, not now, maybe later. (Annie exclaims) - It's very good, I love it. (Annie gasps softly) Sorry what did you ask? - [Bruno] What Andy does. - Oh, nothing exciting. I repair electronics and Annie works as a nurse. (Annie chuckles) (footsteps pattering) (liquid drips) (foot thuds) (man exclaims) (door clicks) (Blackie barks) (man exclaims) (door clicks) (Blackie continues barking) - That's Blackie. (Blackie barks in distance) - He was running around in the kitchen. I decided to send him out so he wouldn't bother us. No, you're wrong. - [Annie] What? - What was on your mind a minute ago? (Annie scoffs) - Are you telling me you can read my thoughts? - Like a page in a book. - It depends on the individual. Some are more transparent than others. (Annie scoffs) - And I'm one of the transparent ones? - Very, yes. (wind gushing) (Blackie howling) (Blackie barking) (ominous music) (Annie sighs) - He's barking again, there's something wrong. - So he's barking, so what? (Blackie barking) (ominous music) (clock ticking faintly) (footsteps pattering) - Annie, do you believe in the existence of situations that can take us beyond our reality? - Mary. - Well, I've often wondered whether those kind of things are really possible or not. - Sure they are. |suppose,depends on the individual. - Well Annie is fascinated by all kinds of mysteries because to her reality is so boring. - I saw that book you've got, it's very interesting. Do you know how to read hands or to tell the future? - We can do a lot better than that. The Ouija. - Ouija? Sounds great. - What is it exactly? - We can talk to the beyond using a glass goblet. (glass clanks softly) - I say it's impossible. (Annie chuckles) - Not with that kind of goblet. This one here. (ominous music) (glass clanks) (ominous music continues) (cloth rustles) - Sit over here. (wood taps) (Andy exclaims) - Thanks. - No thanks. - [Bruno] They're very smooth. - All right then. I'll try one. (Annie chuckles) (wooden box clicks) (Annie blows) - We must all concentrate hard. - [Andy] I warn you, I don't really believe in any of this. (ominous music) (clock ticking faintly) - [Bruno] By the dreadful day of judgment, by the four beasts before the throne, having eyes before and behind, by the ﬁre which is about the throne. I command thee, to grace us with your presence, to enrich our poor souls, to take us into your heart. Talk to us oh powerful one, shroud us in the frozen light of your eternal darkness. I command thee, to enter our temple and let us speak with you. Come oh powerful one. (fire cracking) (ominous music) - Are you here? (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) Are you here? ls there anybody who you wish to talk to particularly? (ominous music) Who would you speak with? Tell us I command thee. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - Bruno. - What would you like to talk to me about? (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - About death. - Will I live to be an old man? - [Annie] No. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - So, when will I die? (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - Answer the question, I command thee. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - Swiss. Swiss, what can it.. Do you think it's Switzerland? - No, suicide. (ominous music) Maybe it means having tried and failed once, he'll try again. - Why do you always shove that down my throat? - So you'll remember dear to be more accurate, another time. That's all. (ominous music) (Annie gasps) - What's the matter? (Annie exclaims) - Nothing. Nothing. - Let's stop this nonsense right now. (Annie exclaims) - Are you afraid? - No. It's okay. Let's go on. I'm all right. (Annie inhales sharply) (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - You understood, didn't you? He doesn't want to have any more to do with you tonight. - Then he'd might like to talk to one of the others. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) - He might. ls there anybody else that you wish to speak to? Who would you wish to speak to? (ominous music continues) (Annie gasps) - [Annie] That's me. Oh god. What do you want to talk to me about? (ominous music) Love. What about it? Tell me. Why won't he answer? - Speak to Annie, speak to Annie about love. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) Annie loves Luis. - It's not true, really. - Annie doesn't love Luis. (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) (Annie gasps) Annie's been lying. - I haven't been lying. I love Andy, no one else. (Annie sobs) - Tell us, who is Luis. (Andy inhales sharply) - He's my brother. It's an old story and it's been over for years. (Annie sobbing) It is over, isn't it Annie? (Annie inhales sharply) - Do you believe that I... (Andy breathing heavily) - How the hell should I know? Maybe if you told me once more. Tell me there's really nothing left between you and Luis. (Annie exhales sharply) - Tell him you're lying. (Annie inhales sharply) Please don't do this to us, tell him you're lying. (ominous music) - By the sea of glass before the face of the prince of darkness. By the dreadful day of judgment. By the fire around thy throne, we call on you oh noble Prince Baal. - Tell him. - [Bruno] We call on you to (mumbles) your terrible curse. - Please tell him you're lying. You're lying. (glass breaks) (Annie screams) (ﬁre cracking) (Annie exclaims) - It's all over sweetheart. - I've got a terrible headache. - Here, drink this it'll help. - No thank you, I don't want anything. Andy let's go home, please. - It's all right if you wanna spend the night here. - No, thank you. Annie's right, we should go home. Listen, I don't wanna be any trouble but would you mind leading us back to the main road? I had no idea how to find it. - That's a problem. With these roads, there's a storm on the way. - Tomorrow you'll see everything in a new light. Sleep well. (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (rain dripping) (thunder rumbling) (liquid sloshes) (Andy sniffs) - Relax. Just take things as they come and don't worry. - You forgive me? - For what? - Well about, you know. It's the only mistake I ever really made. - I prefer never to talk about Luis again. It's in the past let's forget it. - [Annie] Okay. Thank you, Andy. (somber music) (both sigh) (Annie kisses) (Annie gasps) (liquid sloshes) Come on. - What do you mean? - Get in. - With you? (both laughing) (liquid sloshes) (Annie gasps) (Annie laughing) It's a bit small for the both of us. - Oh, you want me to get out then? (liquid sloshes) (both laughing) - Are you sure he's still there? (somber music) (liquid sloshes) (water splashes) (both laughing) (Annie exclaims) (both laughing) (water splashing continues) (somber music) (Annie exclaims) (water splashing continues) (liquid sloshes) (Annie laughing) (somber music continues) (thunder rumbling) - What's the matter now? I thought we'd buried Luis. (thunder rumbling) - I wasn't thinking about that. I was wondering how the hell our address got on the back of the photograph. It seems impossible, we only met them today. - I don't know what to tell you. - It's all pretty weird. And you know, Frank Bradshaw, he never taught class, I know I'm right. (Annie sighs) When I entered college, Frank Bradshaw was the dean. And then he died one day mysteriously. - In what way mysteriously? - It was rumored that he committed suicide. (Blackie whimpers) - Oh no, listen. It's Blackie. (Blackie whimpers) (Andy scoffs) - Then Blackie must have turned into a Wolf and he's out hunting Dracula. (Blackie whimpers) (Annie gasps) - It's Blackie. Let's go down and get him inside. - He likes it out in the open air, lie down. (Annie gasps) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (Andy groans) Go to sleep will you? - I'm trying. - Think about how much sleep our son needs. I don't want the same thing to happen again. We lost one, let's not lose another. - The door locked properly? - Yes. Now then close your eyes and go to sleep. (Annie sighs) (ominous music) (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music continues) (clock ticking continues) (Blackie whimpering) (liquid drips) (Blackie whimpering continues) (rain dripping) (Blackie whimpering continues) (thunder rumbling) (rain dripping) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music continues) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music continues) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music continues) (thunder rumbling) (Blackie barking and whimpering) (ominous music continues) (thunder rumbling) (Annie exclaiming) (thunder rumbling) (Annie exclaims) (thunder rumbling) (Annie sobbing) (thunder rumbling) (Annie continues sobbing) (thunder rumbling) (man mumbles faintly) (thunder rumbling) (Annie moans) (man moans) (thunder rumbling) (man exclaims) (thunder rumbling) (door clicks) (door thuds) (Annie gasps) (switch clicks) (Annie gasps) - [Andy] Annie. What is it Annie? What's the matter? (Annie sobbing) Hey. Come on, what's the matter? - I went downstairs, then someone jumped me and tried to rape me. (Annie sobbing) - Take it easy sweetheart. (Annie continues sobbing) (man groans) (thunder rumbling) (footsteps pattering) (Annie sobbing) Come on, take it easy. (Annie sighs) - Let's go home, Andy. Let's go home. - First of all, I wanna know what the hell is happening here. (Annie sighs) - Andy no, let's just go home. Please, what happened isn't important. - Well it's important to me. I'm sick of their nasty games. (Annie exclaiming) - Andy. - Wait for me here. If you want, you can lock the door while I'm gone. (thunder rumbling) (Andy exclaims) - No, I'll come with you. (thunder rumbling) (ominous music) (footsteps tapping) (ominous music continues) (door creaks) (ominous music) - [Bruno] In the name of Satan, Lord of darkness. Spirit of evil, lead us into temptation, Amen. (Mary moans) Corrupt our souls and bodies. Satan, Prince of fear, (Mary moans) King of the lower world, Prince of Hades, (Mary moans) Prince of rape and fornication, master of hate, (Mary moans) father of incest, Prince of necrophilia (Mary moans) serpent of Genesis, Prince of death, (Mary moans ) grand master of the black arts, protect your humble and faithful servants, Amen. (Mary moans) - Stay where you are. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) You who are of death, who kiss death on the mouth, protect your servants, Satan. Invade our souls and minds, corrupt and defile us and mark us forever with the sign of evil on our foreheads. Oh Satan, come lead us out of misery. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) - You are here I sense you, I feel you. You are here inside me. Inside all of us. Prince Baal, master of all evil. We're yours. (ominous music) (fire cracking) (ominous music continues) (glass breaks) (ﬁre cracking) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (ﬁre cracking) (ominous organ music) (Mary screams) (Mary inhales sharply) (thunder rumbling faintly) - It could be pretty serious. You better call a doctor. - Don't worry about it. She's always been okay. - Well as a nurse I am worried. She might not be all right this time. - Believe me it's nothing. -Andrew, see if you can locate a doctor and get 'em out here, just to be sure. (footsteps pattering) - [Bruno] Here (door clicks) Here's one you can call. He's a friend and he's treated her before. (thunder rumbling) (phone clicks) (thunder rumbling) (Andy sighs) - Great, now a blackout. (Andy sighs) (phone clicks) Hell, dead as a doornail (Annie sighs) - I can't find it. (thunder rumbling) (door taps) - It's not in there. - Hopeless. (phone clicks) (Mary gasps) (Andy exclaims) (Andy moans) (Andy moaning continues) (door clicks) - Well, now we know what cures her. - The telephone doesn't work. It's because of the storm I expect. - Let's go. (box thuds) - Come here, Bruno. (thunder rumbling) - Please, I wanna go home. - Look I swear, she grabbed me. - Do you think I give a damn? - Annie. It's the truth, believe me. (Annie sighs) Look, I'd never find the road tonight, we really are better off staying here. But as soon as it's daylight, we'll head for home, okay? (thunder rumbling) - I don't wanna sleep in this bed. - Sweetheart, I'm very tired. (Annie sighs) (thunder rumbling) (both moaning) (Bruno growling) (ominous music) (man exclaims) - That noise, what was it? (Andy sighs) - Our friends, I imagine. Swinging from the chandeliers.

Let's ﬁnd something to eat. - Yeah, I'm hungry. -And so am I. - Do you realize we didn't have any dinner last night? (Annie exclaims) (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (Andy exclaims) Now I know who really owns this house, Old Mother Hubbard. (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (liquid drips) (footsteps pattering) - Oh, I wonder where the stairs go. - [Andy] I don't know, let's find out.

(footsteps pattering) (wind whooshes) (both growling) - I'm glad you decided to stick around. - We're looking for Blackie. - Blackie? - What's happened to him? - And the car won't start, Bruno. - I doubt if it's serious. I'll help you with it after we've eaten. - I'd like you to help me now. (footsteps pattering) - Not long, a few minutes. We'll eat something and then we'll go and repair your car. ls that all right? - No (engine ignites) - Try again, come on. (engine ignites) - It's dead. - Try again. (engine ignites) Let's go eat something, we'll ﬁx it later. - Wait a minute. You get in and try her, go on. (footsteps pattering) (vegetables cracking) (liquid drips) - What could have happened to Blackie? I'm getting worried now. (Annie gasps) (chopping board thuds) (liquid drips) (Annie gasps) - Where did you find this? It's Frank Bradshaw. You recognize him don't you? You think he threw himself out of the window Andy? - That's what they said. - Maybe he was thrown. Great pity. He was a fine teacher. - I don't remember. - Wait a second. This collar, wasn't it Blackie's? (Annie sobbing) - How awful. We'll bury him in the garden. (Annie sobbing) - You bitch. - Annie. - You murdering bitch. - Annie. (Annie panting) - The poor girl. I think she's blown a gasket. - It was you who killed him. It was her Andy, she did it. - Annie, Annie, take it easy. Come on, take it easy. (Annie sobbing) - What reason would I have for murdering your stupid dog? - Mary, come on, why did you do it? - Only a coward would murder a defenseless animal. A coward. - I agree. Only a coward would do a thing like that. - What are you insinuating? - You know perfectly well, what I mean? - Say it. - That it's much simpler to murder a defenseless dog than to commit suicide. (Mary gasps) (Bruno slaps) (Mary exclaims) (Bruno continues slapping) (Annie sobbing) (Mary exclaims) (Bruno slaps) (Mary exclaims) - Come Annie, (Annie sobbing) it's time we went (Annie sobbing) (gun fires) (Mary screams) (footsteps pattering) (Bruno groans) (footsteps pattering) He's still just about alive.

He needs expert attention. - Doctor. - Mary (Bruno groans) (Annie exclaims) (clock ticking faintly) (engine revving) (clock ticking faintly) (Bruno mumbles) What's he saying? - I don't know. - Sounds like Chinese. - Andy, can't we do anything? Suppose she doesn't come back, we can't just sit here and watch him die. (footsteps pattering) What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna see if I can make that damn car work. (footsteps pattering) (wires click) - Andy! (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) He's dead.

(clock ticking faintly) Nothing more we can do for him. What happened? - I don't know, we were outside and when... The only thing I can imagine, it was an accident. - An accident? That's not what I understood from her. (clock ticking faintly) What did she tell you? - I'm sure you know but you're saying you weren't even in the room when it happened? - No, we weren't. - Are you sure? - Yes, of course. We were walking to the car out in the driveway. - To the car? I heard it wasn't running. - Well, it does now. It wasn't running earlier but I managed to repair it. You see, somebody had pulled a wire off the- - Who did? Her or him? - I don't know. They took the car. - What's this? Blood, I'd say. - I don't see anything. - I assure you it's blood. - Right, yes. It's from the dog. - Oh, what dog? - Please doctor, let's start again, I'll tell you the whole story. - No, no, I have no wish to hear the whole story. My only obligation in this case is to make out a death certificate on our dead friend over there. Time and cause of death. That's my duty. All the rest is your problem. But where's the phone? Oh. - Doctor, my husband's telling the truth. We came here yesterday with our dog. Somebody murdered our dog. - Killing a dog isn't murder, killing a man is. (phone clicks) (clock ticking faintly) (ominous music) By the dreadful day of our judgment, by the four beasts before the throne, having eyes before and behind, by the fire which is around the throne, take thy servant I command thee, into your world of darkness. You stay here. You're not to leave the house. (clock ticking faintly) - Doctor, is there anything we can do? - Nothing, fate will take its elected course. (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (door thuds) (car engine revving) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (Annie gasps) - I'm glad he's gone. And now we just wait, I suppose. Did you hear what he was saying? That funny kind of prayer. -A|| I understood is he didn't believe one damn thing I said. - Are you sure? Are you sure someone pulled off a wire? - What is this shit? You too. Don't you believe me either? - Sorry. I don't know what's happening anymore. I only hope this is a, a bad dream, just a bad dream. - Well unfortunately we're awake, very much awake. (Annie sighs) She just sits there. (Annie exclaims) - Forget about her. Nothing we can do anyhow. (Andy groans) - That's what's driving me crazy. We gotta stick around here and do nothing because there's, there's nothing we can do. Sorry, sweetheart. Here's me doing flips and right now more than ever, we got to keep our cool. (clock ticking faintly) (Bruno gasps) Jesus. (Annie gasps) - Here, I'll fix it. (Annie sighs) - No, I've had enough. What are we doing here? It's madness. And then on top of everything else that quack accusing us of murder. - I told you we should've left. - How? The car was broken. Tell Me how. - Don't ask me, the point is we didn't. - I wonder what kind of bullshit story she told the doctor. - With that bitch I'd expect anything. Hey, you know, I bet she did it, she killed him. (water sizzling) (metal clanks) Here you are. (footsteps pattering) - Now where'd she disappear to? - You, who are of death, you who kiss death on the mouth, protect us and lead us out of our misery. - What are you saying? - I don't know. It just came into my mind. It was something that Mary must've said or maybe Bruno. (wind whooshes) (leaves rustling) - It's so silent. You know the other day (stutters) no I mean, was it yesterday? Oh hell, I'm losing all sense of time. When we were in the bathroom. When was that? - Last night. - Oh. Last night, while you were in the bath, I was watching you in the mirror and I had the strangest sensation. - Of silence? - No. It was a feeling of being empty. As though I'd lost something forever. - You were thinking about Luis. - No, it was something else. It's difﬁcult to explain. It wasn't him. (footsteps pattering) There she goes, a caged animal pacing back and forth. - You think she's all right? - Who cares? She killed Blackie and then murdered her husband. - We don't know either of those things for sure. (Andy shushes) - Listen. - I don't hear anything. - Exactly, I wonder what she's up to. (liquid sloshes) - Seems like water. - Yeah, that's water all right. She's filling up the basin. - That or the bath. (door clicks) (footsteps pattering) (door knocks) - Mary, are you in there? - I hope she hasn't done anything stupid. - Open the door. (door knocks) (door knob clicks) Open the door. (door thuds) (door thuds) (door thuds) (Annie exclaims) (ominous music) (Annie slaps) - We've gotta get her out of these wet clothes. (liquid drips) (inhuman growling) - Where is he? Where's Bruno? - Here drink this. (Mary exclaims) (Annie gasps) - I'm not dead yet, so kill me. Kill me again. - You wanna die? - [Annie] No, stop it. - I'll kill you, - [Annie] Stop it - I'll kill you, I'll kill you. (Annie gasps) - My God, Andy, you killed her. (wind whooshes) (thunder rumbling) - If we're careful and wipe all our prints, no one will ever know we were here. - The doctor knows. - Well, he only saw us once (plate clanks) and when he gets back, we won't be here. It'll be his word against ours. Jesus, what a nightmare. First Blackie then Bruno and that bitch. - Andy, let's get moving. - Just sorry we didn't leave her in the bath to bleed to death. Not that I really got a guilty conscience about strangling her. (Annie exclaims) She deserved to die. Come on, let's go. (Annie sighs) (footsteps pattering) (ominous music) (Annie shrieks) - Oh please, don't leave yet. So you're unhappy you didn't let me bleed to death. (Andy sighs) - Listen, I didn't really- - Yes, you did. I know what happened now. I know, you murdered my husband, you're murderers and I'm going to kill you. With great pleasure. (gun cocks) - No, you're wrong. It wasn't like that. (gun ﬁres) (Annie screams) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (Andy slaps) (Mary exclaims) (ominous music continues) (footsteps pattering) (both breathing heavily) (both groan softly) (Annie exclaims) (water sloshes) (ominous music continues) (Annie moans softly) (ominous music intensifies) - Let me fix your hand. - Not now, get in. (footsteps pattering) (door clicks) (door thuds) (door thuds) (car engine revving) - Oh no. - Now what's wrong? - My bag, I left it inside. - Well, it can stay right there. - There are things with my name on. (door clicks) (footsteps pattering) - Stay there. Keep the engine running. (footsteps pattering) (door thuds) (door clicks) (ominous music) (bushes rustling) (Annie gasps) (dramatic music) (Andy gasps) (Bruno mumbles inhumanly) (gun fires) (Bruno thuds) (ominous music) (gun fires) (doll breaks) (doll screams) (door thuds) (Annie panting) (door and windows thud) (Annie exclaims) (thudding continues) (Annie exclaims) Come on, up. (Annie screams) (ominous music) (car engine revs) (man exclaims) (body thuds) (footsteps pattering) (Annie sobbing) (Annie exclaims) Come on now, we're back home, it's all over. (keys jingling) (door thuds) (switch clicks) (Annie gasps) It's impossible. What's going on? (door clicks) (door clicks) God. I'm going crazy. No, no, no, no, no. (both sobbing) - ls there anything we can do? - Please, did you, did you by chance see anybody go into our apartment? - Why, no. - Yes, the moving men did. (exclaims) - Yes. Somebody did. - Who, who were they? - A moving company. We presumed you've moved to a new place and well it all seemed quite legal. They had keys. (Annie sobbing) - That's impossible. Nobody else had keys. We haven't moved either. - Listen, you can't just stand out here. Why don't you come in? - We don't wanna be a nuisance. - It's no trouble, come on in. Besides, I see you've hurt yourself. - We've got a few friends in for dinner, you're very welcome to join the party. Come along. - You're very kind. (door clicks) (door creaks) (ominous music) (Blackie growls) (ominous music continues) (both exclaiming) (ominous music intensifies) (car engine revving) (brakes screeching) - Hey, you know them? - Who? - The two in the car over there. - No, never seen 'em before. - Hey Gordon, don't you remember me? Andy Baker in college. (upbeat music) (woman vocalizing) (upbeat music)
