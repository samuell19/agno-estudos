KRAMER: There's a reporter in London named Simon Ross. (CAMERA CLICKING) We caught some phone chatter we didn't like and his name came up. They put a team out there to take a better Iook. They've been sitting on him pretty tight all day. l just got a call about an hour ago. We got a real problem here. TURSO: What kind of problem? This guy's a writer for The Guardian. He's preparing an expos√© on Jason Bourne, Treadstone and BIackbriar. Sourced how? Unknown. From Bourne? Is it possibIe? PossibIe? We had Bourne six weeks ago in Moscow. He was on foot, wounded, with a full Cossack posse up his ass. Somehow, he waIked out of there. I've kind of Iost my perspective on what's possibIe. You sound tired, Ezra. I wouId make more of an effort if I were you. You're the director of the CentraI Intelligence Agency of the United States of America, for God's sake. Act Iike it. If I go down for this, Mark, if this goes any more wrong. . . Ezra, you were given a Ferrari and your peopIe treated it Iike a Iawn mower. You break it, you bought it. It was ever thus. Well, maybe I shouId be speaking directIy to Ric Byer. No, no, no. You're in enough troubIe aIready. I'll Iet him know. (WOLVES BARKING) (WOLVES WHIMPERING) (YELLS) (WIND HOWLING) DITA: JuIie, is that the Iast of them? Terrific, thank you. BYER: So, the Iast audit on Treadstone? INGRAM: Third page. DITA: Seven weeks ago. This is from the CIA, or this is ours? Oh, no. It's theirs. This whoIe piIe is theirs. Is anybody reading these ground cabIes? INGRAM: Look, how wide are we digging? What do you mean, "how wide?" Just get me everything. Treadstone, BIackbriar, Outcome, LARX. All the beta programs. And that means take it all the way back to EmeraId Lake. I want all points of convergence, I want all research personneI, I want to know about anybody who taIked to anybody about anything at any time. SeriousIy, has anybody Iooked at this stuff on Bourne? The fieId reports. It's incredibIe. Three years off-program, non-med, first-gen, still rolling. If there's any way we can score some data off of this. . . If they caught him aIive. . . I mean, even as a base Iine. Even forensically. Maybe you're in the wrong meeting. Because the meeting that we're having is about an infection. We're here taIking about a serious infection and all we're trying to do is determine how far it's spread so that we know how much we have to cut to save the patient. You have never heard of Treadstone. And Bourne. . . I don't care if they bag him and drop the body on the sidewaIk. We're not going to touch it. You're going to turn off that side of your head now and get with the rest of us here. And you're going to start to consider the magnitude of what we're facing if this moves sideways on us. Because if we get into this, we dig around, and we find out these CIA cIowns have Iet this Treadstone mess metastasize into the rest of these programs? Just pray that that doesn't happen. (GUN FIRES) (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) (WOMAN SCREAMS) MALE ANCHOR: We'rejust getting reports coming in now from Waterloo Station that there has been a shooting. Let's take you live down there and speak to Jeremy Thompson. Jeremy? There's still an awful lot of confusion here at Waterloo Station. As you can see, ambulances have been called up. The victim, Simon Ross, was a veteran reporter with The Guardian newspaper in London. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are now telling us there was at Ieast one, and possibly as many as three, shots fired. Simon Ross, a reporter with The Guardian newspaper... Hey, James. Hey. Oh, shit, sorry. I didn't know I was coming back. It's all right. (ELECTRONIC BEEP) Can you tell Dr. Hillcott I'm here? You got it. (KEYPAD BEEPING) See you tomorrow. (BEEPS) (BUZZER SOUNDS) I had no idea he was coming in. It's Number Six. Number Six? We haven't seen him since JuIy. Mmm-hmm. Okay. "Need new base paneIs, choIine profiIe, nerve conduction." I want a full engraftment workup. I'm gonna call NRAG and see if we can't get approvaI to put him under. I want a marrow and a full spinaI whiIe we have him. Okay. (TYPING ON KEYBOARD) (DOOR BUZZES) How is he? He's prepped. He drank a haIf-Iiter of water whiIe he was waiting. He had some renaI issues Iast year. Or maybe he was thirsty. I have a pending task request. I know, I read it. I'm trying to compIete my cortex study. He'll get a more sustained contrast off an IV. I'm approved? Mmm-hmm. Yes! Thank you ! Sorry to keep you waiting. We haven't seen you in a whiIe so we're going to be doing a full spec workup. I just had a full spec three months ago. Yeah, well, we had to change the boundary scheduIes and you're a week over the new Iine. Let me get this straight, if I had come in 1 0 days ago, I wouId have been in the cIear? It never gets any Ionger, does it? You're gonna have to take that off. (GLASS TINKLING) Today, l have the honor of introducing the man who is going to introduce our guest of honor. Bert? Doctor Albert Hirsch. (ALL CLAPPING) DR. HIRSCH: l first met Dan Hillcott in 1 987 at what must have been the most boring neuropsych conference ever held. We managed to escape that dreary ballroom and find a dark corner and a cold beverage. And we've been finding dark corners ever since. (PEOPLE MURMURING APPROVINGLY) TURSO: (SIGHS) My God. (CHUCKLES) Where did you find this? YouTube. I thought we had everything firewalled. BYER: Yeah, so did I. But then again, I thought the CIA wouId handIe Treadstone, so maybe I'm just behind the curve. Hmm. (SCOFFS) Well, is that it? Is that all of it? No, no. They apparentIy thought it was okay to attend about a haIf a dozen of these things together. Proving what? We're Iooking at the medicaI directors of Treadstone and Outcome pubIicIy ceIebrating their top secret man-crush. If this Bourne mess exposes Treadstone, they will turn Hirsch inside out. They'll be taIking to Hillcott before we even know what happened. What's the damage? Outcome. We'd Iose Outcome. Uh, meaning what? Meaning we will burn the program to the ground. And I mean from top to bottom. Because of this? Because they're friends? These two guys buiIt our pIatform ! You want to wake up and see this on CNN? Jesus, Ric. Just Iike that? Hirsch and Hillcott? How many peopIe even understand this work, Iet aIone have the will to pursue it? Nothing has even happened yet! And we have to get ready. Ready for what? We don't Iose it all, we've got the science. We'll keep the data. All of our JSOK Iiaisons seem to be safe. We've got the beta programs tucked away. We'll take a pause, and we'll rebuiId it. I wish there was a better aIternative, but. . . God. (COCKS GUN) (FIRING) Are you going to pretend you don't know I'm here? I was just trying to be poIite. I wasn't expecting you so soon. What did you do? Did you come over the mountain? Don't they forward my position? You beat the record by two days. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You didn't know there was a record? No. It never came up. It wasn't your record, was it? No one comes over the mountain. Yeah, well, I did. I'm Aaron, by the way. Why did you do that? If you weren't on the cIock, why take the risk? Why take the mountain? I Iost my chems. I dropped my program kit, that's why. All right. ProtocoI is for me to call in your arrivaI. They're going to want a sampIe pick-up. You got bIood work, right? I owe today. All right, pull it now. The drone takes about three hours to get up here so I'll get some food started. You can dry your shit. So, Iook. . . I got a reaI probIem, here. I came over that mountain because I Iost my chems. What are you taking? My daiIy? Phys meds, 250 green. Cognitive programs, 400 bIue. Define "Iost." Lost. Fell into the rocks off a 20-meter cIiff. Lost. How is that possibIe? Look, I've had a pack of woIves on my ass since I Ieft the drop, okay? I thought I Iost them, but they came at me at the river, so I took the Iedge up to the ravine to try to rally out the night. I chose wrong. I got caught out in the open, I couIdn't cIimb. I couIdn't make a fire, my hands got stiff. I dropped them. You're going to have to write that up. (CHUCKLES) So, is that yours? Hmm? The bIood work? That's yours, isn't it? You're not a contact, are you? Look, I'm sorry to call you out Iike that. It's just that. . . I have never met anybody in the program before. Never, nobody. You're the. . . I know you have some extra chems here. I'm not supposed to ration you out untiI you Ieave tomorrow. Yeah. Did you chem today? AARON: Green onIy. I haven't had a bIue in 32 hours. PeopIe, Iisten up. We have an imminent threat. This is a nationaI security emergency, priority IeveI five. It's Wills. Ric Byer. Hey. Uh, he's here. Bourne is here, in New York. What? Jason Bourne is in Manhattan. Confirmed. He's aIive and mobiIe. That's all I have. I gotta go. (MOTOR WHIRRING) (WOLVES HOWLING) Your friends are here. I know. Don't you think that's strange? The woIves? They don't do that. They don't track peopIe. Yeah. Maybe they don't think you're human. So, how many of us are there? You ask too many questions. Maybe you don't know, either. So, what are you doing up here anyway? How do you know that I'm not evaIuating you? I don't know. Are you? Maybe I don't care. Do you ever not care? Maybe you're evaIuating me. I went off the grid for four days, that's why I'm here. I skipped my check-in. Now I'm on this bullshit scavenger hunt. They have their reasons. Yeah, well. . . I thought I was having my wrist sIapped, but now I'm not so sure. I'm still trying to figure out if you're supposed to kill me or give me a pep taIk. SeriousIy, man, you think too much. Aren't we wired to stick our nose in, you and I? There's not another person for 300 miIes. I know nobody's Iistening. Come on, you've got to give me something. TaIk to me, come on ! Why did they pull you off the fieId and put you up here? It's not physicaI, with the way you've been moving, so what did you do? Turn down an assignment? Start thinking for yourseIf? Fall in Iove? You fell in Iove. (COCKS GUN) It's better for woIves. There's an ammo box by the door, you take as much as you need. We're done taIking. You ate, you're pulling out earIy. You shouId hit it. Okay. Some other time, then. Yeah. Thanks. Good Iuck. (SPEAKING KOREAN) What's this? BYER: I think that we need to cIarify something here, Don. PAULSEN: CIarify what? You keep using the word "unacceptabIe" and I want to know exactIy what you think you mean by that. "UnacceptabIe" means exactIy that. I don't Iike what you're telling me, I don't Iike how you're telling me. We're in a criticaI phase on four missions, Ric. The intelligence Ioss, if we stop now, it couIdn't be quantified. Yes, actually, it couId. You'd be right back to where you were before we deIivered the program. Don't tell me there's a probIem with Outcome because I'd be hearing about it. I didn't say there was. You're not saying much of anything. One pill, once a week. Every eight days. So, no more bIues and greens. We're transitioning everyone in the program. Do you remember how to keep an accurate diet Iog? Yes. PAULSEN: Do you understand their full utility? We just set Iran's missiIe program back 36 months with one deep-cover agent. The best action recon out of North Korea in the Iast two years came from Outcome. I'm fully aware of this. Do you know how Iong we've waited to get a reaI, Iong-term operative inside Pakistani ISI? You're asking me to wipe the most vaIuabIe inteI-gathering assets we've ever put in the fieId. We're shutting things down immediateIy and this contingency was covered Ioud and cIear. PAULSEN: Tell me this isn't why we're having this conversation. Jason Bourne got away, didn't he? That's what this is all about, isn't it? I have visibiIity on every action program in the system except yours. I'm sick of hearing the reason I can't do something or see something is because it hasn't cIeared the NationaI Research Assay Group. Where do you pull this kind of weight? Don, I'm a patriot, the same as you are. I bIeed over this the same way you do. But you and I have our jobs because we've got the strength to do what's necessary and I'm sorry, but right now, this is it. (PANTING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) (GUARDS SHOUTING) It's really coming down out there. It's getting ugIy. Oh, yeah? Well, maybe I shouId try to get ahead of it, huh? No, it's too Iate for that. Just stick around. I need some heIp squaring the pIace away, anyway. Yeah, I don't know. I aIready have to do that medication write-up. I don't know if I want to have to expIain my itinerary as well, you know what I mean? Don't worry about the chems, I got that covered. I'm gonna have a Iook. (VERY FAINT WHIRRING) Are you hearing that? Are you expecting anything? In this weather, without a heads-up? Well, it's definiteIy getting cIoser. What do you got? Nothing, man, I got nothing. Is it working? Yeah, it's working. The gear is fine. It's not the gear. Well, maybe it's a resuppIy. They were here yesterday, and they can't Iand in this, anyway. Who the hell is it? I don't know. I don't know. We shouId spread. Yeah. Look, I'll take the nest. Let me know when you get eyes on it, okay? Yeah. (GRUNTS) (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) (GRUNTS) PILOT: Is she gonna cIear us here? I'd Iike to get above this before it gets any sIoppier. Now, hoId on. Just, there's a. . . Copy, SoIo, I saw it, too. Give us a minute. SOLO: Wilco. PILOT: What's the issue? Hang on, hang on. Roger, SoIo. Sourcing now. It Iooks Iike there's still an active signaI back there. Excuse me? Is that on your end or is that. . . SOLO: My end. We're having a hard time getting a handshake. Roger, SoIo. HoIding on reIay. I thought you had them Iinked. We did. They were Iined up, all the way to the structure. Both targets were green, all the way in. SOLO: ls there a PlD? Unknown. Hostile? Unknown. OFFICER: It's not a satellite echo, is it? No, sir. OFFICER: What's she doing? She's pIaying it back. I don't want to wait on her. We're going to have to come around. How far are you from bingo fueI? Twenty minutes on station. Better get on it. SPEC: Affirmative, SoIo, but we're gonna need another pass here. She knows we can't see shit, right? Check it. Roger that. New profiIe engaged. We're coming around now. PILOT: Roger that, Solo. East-southeast. Coming right back up the valley. Requesting fueI graph, say your state. PILOT: State two-pIus-30 to spIash. Copy, SoIo. FueI to bingo is green. Sourcing target beacon now. (RAPID BEEPING) What just happened? It's gone. Where the hell did it go? What do you mean, "Where did it go?" SoIo, we are negative on that signaI here. We just Iost that second beacon. Negative, negative, SoIo. All sensors and systems are green. Diagnostics are green, aircraft is green. I got everything but a target here. It is not a system issue. Sensors are good. All right, we're going to switch to IR and take a Iook. Roger. Switching to thermaI. (FIRES) SoIo, can I get your Iast confirmed. . . (THUD OVER SPEAKER) (STATIC HISSING) What the hell was that? SOLO: Red Crown, we're getting some music. SPEC: You hit something. I don't think so. Red Crown, you getting this? There is nothing there. There is nothing. What the hell is going on, here? It didn't just go down, it was shot down? They're sure about that? That's what I was toId. By who? With what? They don't know. They were sourcing a second signaI when it happened. DITA: No, no, no, we didn't have time. I'm calling for cIearance now. There's got to be someone meeting us at the gate. They have a drone ready? They're fueIing one now. They parsed the signaI. It's Aaron Cross. Shit. You're all set, sir. PILOT: Let's approach off azimuth, 30 degrees off our Iast pass. SPEC: Good for me. SOLO: Red Crown to contact. Three-zero-zero for 30. SPEC: There you are. There's my signaI. SignaI is hot, SoIo. SignaI is up and Iive. And here we go. PILOT: Where's that been? Doesn't matter now. It's mine. Copy, SoIo. Strong signaI. What kind of weapon system is this guy operating? He's probabIy got a rifIe. BYER: It's a high-powered rifIe. What's our time frame, here? Fifteen minutes, pIus or minus. Just trying to factor the storm. (WOLF HOWLING) (HOWLING CONTINUES) (GROWLING) SPEC: Roger, Solo. Target is static. Engaging laser now. Hey! (SNARLS) Get out of here! Go on, get out of here! Get out! (WHIMPERS) (BARKING) SPEC: Laser armed. Sensor and thermaI confirmed. (GROWLING) Where are we? SPEC: Thirty seconds. You shouId have Ieft me aIone. (DRONE APPROACHING) SPEC: Arming missiIe. MissiIe away. There he goes, he's moving now. PILOT: Not for Iong. SPEC: Target destroyed. SOLO: Red Crown, splash one. Copy, SoIo. Kill confirmed, target destroyed. PILOT: Looking good? SPEC: Looks good. Looks coId and cIear. AARON: With all due respect, sir, now is not the best time. In 20 minutes, this place is going to fall apart. BYER: I'm aware of that, I'll take the chance. We need to taIk. I need you to stop what you're doing and turn around. That's an order. We got screwed on the inteI, okay? Nobody knew those peopIe were in there. It wouId be perfectIy normaI for a person to have doubts about the moraIity of what we just asked you to do. Is that a question, sir? No, it's not. Tune in to what I'm trying to say to you. Do you know what a sin-eater is? That's what we are. We are the sin-eaters. It means that we take the moraI excrement that we find in this equation and we bury it down deep inside of us so that the rest of our cause can stay pure. That is the job. We are morally indefensibIe and absoIuteIy necessary. Do you understand? Will that be all? (EXPLOSION BOOMS) Stitch that up. I'm gonna put you on a pIane to Yemen in six hours. I'll be ready. (LOUD EXPLOSION) TERRY: I toId you she'd be coming at us. Yeah, I need you to stay caIm, Terry, okay? They're giving her a Senate hearing. How can you not see that as a probIem? She knows Bourne, she knows BIackbriar, she knows Hirsch. She's got a handIe on the whoIe goddamn operation. I don't see how the hell you couId be so caIm about this! Well, what can she say? What can she say? What if she gets up there and she says, "Treadstone, BIackbriar, you think that was it? "You think that Jason Bourne was the whoIe story? "Sorry, there's a Iot more going on here." What if she tells them that Treadstone was just the tip of the iceberg? BYER: Look, you want to sweat something? Worry about Outcome, because we're still not out of the woods. But as far as our other programs, she doesn't know that much. How do you know that? Because we're tapped into everything she says and does. What? Phones, emaiI, cars, house, Iawyer. She was cooked the minute she hitched her wagon to Jason Bourne. She aided and abetted an internationaI fugitive. She prevented the agency from shutting down a rogue operation. She vioIated every oath and code of conduct that matters. For Christ's sake, she brought the son of a bitch back to America. Now, God knows what her motives are, but it's cIear that protecting this country is not one of them. That used to be called treason. (MACHINE WHIRRING) Even the soIution here. Now, that shouId be coming up as a constant. (MACHINE BEEPS) There you are. I don't understand these vaIues. . . (GASPS) DR. BENEZARA: My God, no! Did you hear that? Yeah. WOMAN: What is that? It's a gun. No. I. . . No. Yeah. No, it was gunfire. No, pIease. No, no, no! (GUN FIRES) HeIp! (POUNDING ON DOOR) Open the door! He's shooting us! Open the door! (ALARM CHIMING) DR.

We gotta go for the back door. It's Iocked. He Iocked the back door. (WHIMPERING) No, pIease. He's gonna kill us all. (SHUSHING) DR. CHANDRA: Don't do this. Oh, my God. Move! He's shooting everyone in there! I need a red Iab access card ! Who's got a red Iab access card? They're bringing one down from upstairs. They're all in there. Everyone who has one is in there. Billy, where are you, man? I need a red card now! (DR. BENEZARA GROANS) Don. . . What are you doing? (GUN FIRES) (GASPS SOFTLY) (ALL CLAMORING) Shit, the handIe's off. (GUN FIRES) The handIe's off! (GRUNTS) Drop it! Stop! Drop the weapon ! Drop it! Drop the weapon ! (GUN FIRES) (GASPING) (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) MALE ANCHOR: lnvestigators are still searching for some explanation behind the workplace murder-suicide that left another American community grieving and shocked. Police and federal authorities (KNOCKING ON DOOR) DITA: The boys need to see you right away. Let's get that Foite story out there right away. I'll take care of it. COP: And this area, back here? That's all been converted to storage. Because it says on the bIueprint, and even on the board, there, that it's a medicaI examination suite. I mean, what kind of examinations are we taIking about? MARTA: There we go. May l see the hand, please? Oh, that has heaIed well. Any diminished sensation? Nope. Are you trying to put me down, doc? I'm afraid there's been a few gaps in your sampIe deIiveries, so. . . Uh-oh. . . .we need a full work-up this visit. Another one? Why? Is it 'cause I missed a bIood drop? So, how do you think it works, doc? That we can just call a timeout? Everything stops whiIe you pull your sampIes? Why don't you Iie down and reIax? Yeah. What do you think that we do out there? Okay, that's enough information. No, I. . . Well, you're just a doctor. You know we're on camera. Really? Is that why you make such an attractive appearance? Okay, why don't you count backward from 1 00, pIease? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (COUNTING IN RUSSIAN) (TELEPHONE RINGS) Hello? Yeah, the gate shouId be open. Bear to the Ieft. It's about haIf-a-miIe up. Thanks. Dr. Shearing? Uh-huh. Hi, I'm Dr. Connie Dowd. Hi, how are you? Well, thanks. This is SpeciaI Agent Larry Hooper. Hello. Hello. PIease. Come in. DR. DOWD: Thanks for Ietting us come out. It's a remarkabIe property. What a project. Yeah, I really don't want to taIk about the house. Not unIess you want to buy it. Sit, I guess. PIease. MARTA: Just so you know, okay, I didn't know anything about this meeting untiI an hour ago. And nobody Iast night said to make time or pick a time, or anything Iike that. And then, this morning, I buy a pIane ticket to see my sister and suddenIy it's Iike DEFCON 4 around here. And that is not paranoia, okay? That is pretty much directIy in my face! DR. DOWD: Understood. ShouId we not be paying attention? Can you Ieave us aIone, Larry? Look. You've just been through an extremeIy traumatic experience. Yeah. Doctor of what? What are you? CIinicaI psychoIogy. Oh. So, what do you do? You give grief counseIing to spies? You have a very unusuaI security cIearance, Marta. You shouId expect that buying a ticket to MontreaI without telling anyone wouId set off some bells. Yeah, I've got some bells of my own going off, okay? I mean, are you going to be the person who tells me what the hell is going on here, or are you just the next mystery babysitter? What do you think is going on? What I'm trying to do is not think. I just. . . I want to stop thinking. Have you discussed those feeIings with anyone eIse? Your sister? Friends? Are you for reaI? What about Peter Boyd? Wow. Okay. So, we're into everything, is that it? Is anything off-Iimits here? Have you ever read your empIoyment security contract? Have I read my. . . If you're asking me whether I understand my discIosure restrictions, yes, I have a PhD in biochemistry with postdoctoraI fellowships in viroIogy and genetics. I know how to read ! What I don't understand is why my colleague has a psychotic episode and shot everyone in the Iab. Are you aware of what we do in there? Are you? I mean, how do I know that you're even cIeared for this conversation? Have you discussed anything to do with the incident with anyone other than the investigators? Peter Boyd moved out eight months ago. But I guess you aIready know that. And, no, I haven't spoken to him. You stated that you and Dr. Foite had no reIationship outside of work. None. There was materiaI in his apartment that indicates he had an unusuaI fixation with you. Photographs, journaI entries. They found severaI articIes of cIothing. What? Did you ever rebuff him in any way? No. No, no, I. . . I aIways thought he was gay. Look, no one is suggesting that you're responsibIe for what happened. Oh. Thank you. Survivors often experience feeIings of guiIt. Those feeIings can be ampIified by the reaIization that he Iet you Iive. That he Iet me Iive? Have you seen the video? Do you really think that's what it shows? You are asking all the wrong questions! What shouId I be asking, Marta? Has anyone Iooked at Dr. Foite's bIood work? Have they? I mean, that is the onIy thing that is going to make any sense, here. His behavior was. . . Look, there are projects at Sterisyn, defense projects that couId expIain why he did what he did. And peopIe there are working on behavioraI design. It's programmabIe behavior, neuraI design. Do you understand what I'm telling you? I think he was exposed to something at the Iab. Found it. What are you doing? That's my gun. What the hell is this? You're a potentiaI suicide risk. No. Wait a minute. How did you. . . How did he find that? Marta. . . No, no. Okay. This meeting is now over. I want you both out of here, right now! Marta. . . No! He has been snooping around my house! Marta, I want to sign off here today! I want to Iet you get on that pIane, but you have got to heIp us out! Look, we have got to do our job here, okay? We have got to go through this. I need to know that you are caIm and safe before I Ieave here and I need to know that you understand the ruIes before you get on that pIane. PIease, just. . . PIease, sit down and Iet us get through our questions. Okay. (MARTA SCREAMS) Jesus! What is this? What the hell is this? Ready? CIose. What are you doing? Get off me! Set? Get the hell off me now!

I'm not here to hurt you, okay? How did you. . . That was you ! Yes. Shh ! Listen to me. Do you want to Iive? Look at me. Do you want to Iive? Do you want to Iive? Yes. Good. Let go of this gun. How is this possibIe? Let go. Take this. Good. Now, I need you to do exactIy what I say. How is this possibIe? Listen to me. ExactIy what I say. Understand? Yeah. Good. (DOOR CLOSES) AARON: Hey, doc? I need my watch. Doc, I need that watch ! Are there chems in this house? Program medication. Are they all dead? Yeah, they're dead. Look at me. Look at me. Do you have program medication here? What? Chems. Greens, bIues. Do you have them here? No, no. No? Here? No, no. Here. Where, then? Where do you have them? Where? Where do you keep the chems? I don't know. Dr. Shearing, where are the chems? I need the chems! I understand, but I don't know. (STUTTERING) It's not something. . . We do viroIogy controI. So, all of that happens. . . We don't have medication. If I had any, I wouId give it to you. Okay, Iisten to me. We have Iess than eight minutes to cIear out of here, okay? Yes. Good. Because the next thing coming through that door is going to wipe us out. (RADIO CRACKLES) Can I get a sitrep, here? If you can hear me, pick up, Larry. (OVER RADIO) Larry, pick up. AARON: Hey. Sorry about the tran. What's our frame-rate, here? Connie says about 1 0. Just wrapping up. Tell her we need a heads-up. Okay? Copy that. Hey. It's probabIy better you did this. (LOUD EXPLOSION) (SIREN WAILING) Where are we going? June. Your name is June Monroe, say it. June Monroe. Say it. June Monroe. Now pick a pIace you Iived. The Iast pIace you Iived. A pIace you know. Bethesda. Bethesda, that's where you Iive. Anybody asks, you're June Monroe from Bethesda. You Iost your wallet. I'm driving you home. My name is James. James and June, you got it? Yeah. Okay. Is that your name? James? No. What? You don't know my name? What do you call me? What do you put on my bIood work? Five. Five? The number five? Do you know how many times we've met? Thirteen. Thirteen exams over the Iast four years. And that's what I get, a number? Number Five. Okay. Five of what, then? How many are we? Program participants? That's what you call us? There were nine. Then six. Participants. How did you find me? Well, what do you think? They're going to kill all of us and then just Ieave you guys aIone? You think your colleague just went crazy? Is that what you think? I didn't think anything. They wound him up and set him Ioose. I really have no idea what is going on. What's going on is they're shutting the whoIe thing down. Who is "they"? I don't know. . . Who were the peopIe at the house? No, no, no, no. You had your turn, okay? You've been bIeeding and scoping and scraping me since the day we met. It's my turn, now. I'm asking the questions, you got it? I need program meds, okay? I need program meds. Where do you keep the chems? I don't have any. I've aIready toId you. We don't have them. Bullshit. Bullshit. It's bullshit. I don't have any! So, you don't know anything? You're just the heIp? That's why you have the big house and the security cIearance, right? That's why they're trying so hard to kill you, because you don't know anything. I know my job, which is science. I don't know what you do when you Ieave the Iab. None of us do! For four years! Look, I want to get out! WouId you pIease stop the car? You can't be that naive. WouId you Iet me out the car? There's no way you're that naive! You want out? Get out. Go on, get out. You don't have any chems. You don't know where they are. You don't know anything. That's fine. Just get out. But you got a pIan, right? Yeah, of course you do. You're a doctor. You've got this all worked out, don't you? What are you going to do? Huh? What are you going to do? You can't run, not aIone. You don't know how. You certainIy can't hide. Not from peopIe Iike this, with the resources they have. You won't make it to sundown. So, what does that Ieave you? You can go pubIic, sure. You can go Ioud. Call your sister, because that worked out well for you. Call some ex-roommate. Call a guy that knows a guy at The Washington Post. Put it onIine. 'Cause you know what? You bIow me off, that's the onIy pIay you've got. But you'd better ask yourseIf this. CouId you ever say it Ioud enough or fast enough that they'd be too afraid to finish what they've started? Now, I've got a pIan, and it's just not that compIicated. What I'm going to do is wait for the next person to show up to kill you. Maybe they can heIp me. So, go for it. I had no choice. I had to get out of there. No, I had to get out of there! No, nobody. I have no idea. You have to understand. All the work at Outcome, all those tests, the burn rates, dosage paneIs, tissue stress. I mean, that is us tuning chemistry. We don't fabricate anything. That happens downstream. Wait. What's that mean, "downstream"? It means you need Iive virus to seed adhesion. CuItures are highIy reactive. You have to process on-site and we wouId never do it here. Okay. On-site, where? Where? Where do we hoId the virus? Yes! Well, we can't drive there. Where is it? ManiIa. The PhiIippines. Where do you stand with your dosage? I have 300 milligrams of bIues. It's not even enough for another day. I haven't had a full green in 51 hours, which is strange because I don't feeI physically degraded. But we'll see. Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say you're still taking greens? What are you taIking about? You were viraIed off physicaI medication Iast year. What? Jesus. They viraIed everyone off greens eight months ago. They infected you with Iive virus, which means that, physically, you're stabIe. You don't need to take greens. They Iocked it in. Any physicaI enhancement is now permanent. So, you infected me? When was this? Is this when I was sick? The mystery fIu? That was you? Well, it wasn't me. I didn't do it. That was you. That was on purpose, right? When I aImost died. I'm sorry, but it wasn't me. Why am I still taking green pills, then? I don't know. I thought you had stopped. Why am I asking you anything? Or to keep us on a Ieash, right? Is that it? To keep a hoId on us? To keep us dependent? Who tells you that this is okay? No one. . . I do. . . Who says it's okay? I do research. I design, I survey. I don't administer meds. I don't make poIicy! No, you just Ioad the gun. Oh, God. Look, I was there for the science. We were all there for science. And I know you don't care, but I made a huge sacrifice. I couIdn't pubIish, I couIdn't conference. I couIdn't tell a singIe person what it was I did. But I thought I was heIping my country, and I know that's. . . Tell me you can viraI off bIues. Can you viraI off bIues? Theoretically, yes. Yeah. Pills allow for temporary adhesion. Okay. To Iock it in, you need Iive cuIture. Live virus! You know how to do that. Do you know how to do that? Yes. Okay. Yes, but I toId you, it's on the other side of the pIanet. Well, guess where we're going? WOMAN: Welcome to Washington. Welcome to Candent World Headquarters. We want to make sure that over the next few days you have a chance to connect with the people who have made Sterisyn Morlanta the crown jewel in the Candent group of companies. FinaI Phase 3 testing approvaI is expected this month for both reQuieI and SupressoIyn. Confidence is high that we're coming in on scheduIe, and we want to be ready. We know the market is eager. We know, gIobally, the kind of. . . What the hell don't I know about this? You're directing that at me? That was a D-Trac team we sent in there. I don't know what that means. It means they're good at what they do. I was toId that they were missing. They don't just go missing. What didn't you tell us about this woman? Nothing. She is who she is. There's nothing to tell. You vetted her up and down. Then what the hell are we Iooking at? INGRAM: She has a registered gun. TURSO: They knew that going in. She's got buiIding permits. Propane, weIding tanks. A stray bullet? You want to keep guessing? We've got to get in there. I've got a dozen peopIe waiting on the perimeter. We don't controI the site? DITA: Not yet. Getting the picture now? Okay, stop! I can't run this from here. I need a crisis suite. I need integrated grids and comms. I need all of it. NSA, or Pentagon, or Liberty Crossing. I don't care, just get me something now. Pack up your codes and your drives, and whatever eIse you're going to need. We're going to move and we're going to stay there. Dita, how am I putting a net over that house? There's IocaIs all over it. We go with germs. She took sampIes from work. Pathogens, viruses. It's nationaI security. Good, okay, I Iike that, it pIays. Now, get it out there, get it out there. Come on, Iet's go, Iet's go. Everybody find another gear, okay? Because I want to be out of here in 20. MARTA: So, Iet's say you want to change the human body. You want to fix a mistake. You want to repair something, improve something. Well, if you're going to reprogram human genetic materiaI, you need a deIivery system, and nothing works better than virus. It's Iike a suitcase. You pack in genetic mutation, infect the body and the vector unIoads into the target cells. But getting it where you want it, how you want it, is the nightmare. UnIess you have a map. There was this terribIe accident at Fort Detrick in 1 985. Five researchers dropped dead in the Iab, and it was such a catastrophe that they brought in Dan Hillcott from Stanford to assess the damage. He got in there and he reaIized that, underneath it all, was this incredibIe breakthrough in viraI-receptor mapping. He had a map. You've had some very minor aIterations made to two different chromosomes. The green side, the physicaI side, is nothing more than a 1 .5 percent rise in your mitochondriaI protein uptake. But with 1 .5 percent, you see this immediate increase in celluIar tempo, muscIe efficiency, oxygenation. . . And the bIue side? Intelligence, obviousIy, but it's more than that. It's neuraI regeneration and eIasticity. Sensory function. Pain suppression. It's the most exciting deveIopment in genomic targeting in the history of the science. My God. Hey, how do I get monitor 71 up on the big screen? Coming up. They found a body. They're pretty sure it's a woman, and it's not Marta Shearing. They found dog tags. They think she was shot. Hey. Marta, I. . . You can't call anyone. There are peopIe that care about you that think you're dead. And there's nothing you can do about it. Anyone you contact becomes a target. So, you need to put aside any normaI emotionaI response that you have. The onIy edge we've got right now is they think we're both gone. All right? All right. So, you're going to want to go through this. You know, just be famiIiar with it. June Monroe. Who is June Monroe? You are. Do you know her? Not anymore. Why do you have to stay enhanced? Why is it so important to you? Come here. What is this? This was me. Was. My army recruiter was Iooking to make his quota. He added 1 2 points to my IQ. TweIve points to make the minimum. You ever seen a cognitive degrade, Marta? Sensory withdrawaI? You ever do that? Pull someone's bIues and watch them drop off their meds? No. Because they paint a pretty graphic picture in training. Hell of a Iong way to fall. If I can't keep it together, we won't make it. They bit. Who? Washington Post. We just fIagged an emaiI. They're going with the story about the possibIe theft of the dangerous materiaIs from the Iab. Wow, they took it. They aIready fIagged a DWI conviction. That's convenient. They found another body. One of ours. They're picking up shell casings all over the pIace. I don't think your doctor's in there. (WINDING FLASH MECHANISM) (SHUTTER CLICKS) Boarding pass and ID, pIease. Thank you. Thank you.

The traiI is definitive and fresh. The canine team tracked her from her house through this wooded area, ending here, at this IittIe parking Iot. Either she had a car waiting for her, or somebody picked her up. There are security cameras on the street, but there's nothing back here. There's got to be satellite footage. MaryIand's not exactIy a high-vaIue U.S. target. There'll be pIenty of weather imaging, but we're gonna have to swing a IittIe wider to find something reaI-time that's enhanceabIe. We're draining some foreign pIatforms. We need about an hour. Come on, she's not pulling this off on her own. Who the hell is heIping her? MALE ANCHOR: We'll find out more in the next hour, while we are currently in court. Now back to Jenn. JENN: The FBl this morning confirmed reports that Dr. Albert Hirsch died of heart failure in a Washington, D.C. hotel. Dr. Hirsch had been expected to testify yesterday before a Senate lntelligence committee. That select committee is investigating links between a troubled ClA program known as Treadstone and this man, Jason Bourne. Police and federal officials are searching for Bourne in connection with recent shootings in New York and in London. Dr. Hirsch had been cooperating with the Justice Department and was in protective custody at the time of the incident. A committee spokesman told reporters last night that the hearings will be postponed temporarily as they evaluate the loss of Doctor... FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Hi, foIks. Just going to remind you to keep the aisIes cIear for any baggage during takeoff and Ianding. Excuse me. Thank you. Pardon me, sir. Sir, do you need heIp finding your seat? Sir? No, I got it.

INGRAM: Here comes the other one into the car, and there they go. Where? DITA: We Iose them east. Our window drops out about two miIes up the road. But we've got the siIhouette. We've got surveillance footage, racked and ready to go. We're going to spIit teams, find this car and Iink up a traiI. With a 1 7-hour head start? Where the hell can she go?

DITA: Wilmington, Delaware. This is our car, the LeSabre. We see it coming into the structure. It goes under, comes back around, and it parks here. But it doesn't come out. This is inside. It's four minutes after arrivaI. It's her. Do we know what she's doing? She was having her passport picture taken. DITA: Logan, Hartford, LaGuardia, Kennedy, Philly, Newark, Dulles, Reagan. We start with yesterday morning, that is our wedge. We cIear that, and then we move up the cIock. She wants to know if you want Hartford, because she can get it. BIue coat, second row. She's got a red bag. Which one? I have four. All right, I have TSA Authorization 1 , 6, 9 and 1 2. Airports given, all departures. Yes, the internationaI terminaI first. We're aImost there.

What's all this? Hi, how are you? Dr. Shearing ! Dr. Shearing. Hey, it's me, Joseph. Joseph ! Hello, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. WeIcome back. Thanks. I'm sorry. I just don't have you on my Iist arriving. That's because we had to change our scheduIe. Yeah, we took an earIier fIight. Joseph, I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way. It's nice to meet you. PIeased to meet you, too, but Dr. PumaIoy is not here, he went to Singapore. He just Ieft yesterday. The girIs have gone home. No one toId me anything. Right. Well, I understand. Well, Iook, we're going to be here all week, and we have a Iot of work to do, so we need to get in there tonight and get things started, okay? Yeah, of course, it's just that. . .

Get it up there. Put that up on the big screen. Yes, I'm here. Good. Where? I need an immediate upIoad on that passenger manifest. I know. Here she is, I'm putting her back on. ManiIa. She took American 1 67 to ManiIa. She Ianded 45 minutes ago. Aaron. Are you okay? BYER: There's 243 people on that plane. We're going to scope every one of them right now. So, pick a face that you Iike, pull it down, and deseIect it if you've cIeared it. If there is anything that smells wrong to you, if there's a hair out of pIace that you don't Iike, you do not cIear it. You fIag it and you send it over to Dita and we'll check it out. We have to be working off the same grid. That's HomeIand 9.5. If you don't pull that access, raise your hand, CoIoneI Hardy's going to come over and sort you out. So, this is it, huh? Yeah. Okay. What the hell are we into, Terry? I don't know. It's your shop. What is going on over there? What did I say? I don't know. Well, how many trips has she made over there? Five, six, I don't know.

BYER: l don't know. VENDEL: He's Iooking for meds. TURSO: What? That's where the chems come from. What eIse wouId he be doing? INGRAM: She's got to be helping him. TURSO: But how? How is that possible? BYER: I don't know how. I don't care. He's aIive, they're there. "How" doesn't really matter, does it? The onIy mission we've got now is to drop a bag over this. Are the drugs he's Iooking for there, or not? Jesus, I don't. . . Terry? No. No, there's nothing there. We haven't made a run in 1 6 weeks. Besides, we wouIdn't store the pills there, anyway. lt's basically a kitchen. We tweak the recipe and we bake up a batch when we need it. Then what the hell are they doing? The stems are there.
