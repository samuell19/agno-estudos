Mom? Josh, baby. How do I look? You look...you look great. Really great... -I've missed you so much. -Me, too. I'm so glad you're back. You've gotta be Josh. -Oh, darling, this is David Hollis. -Hi. I... I want you to be friends. David is a fellow actor. Oh... I love it when a star calls himself an actor. The false modesty of the famous just puts me away. So, Josh, how are things in Dayton? Oh, I wouldn't know. I came from Cleveland. -Oh, that's right. Sorry. -Ah, Elliston, actually. Elliston, Ohio. I can't believe I actually came from a little town in the Midwest. Cleveland, Dayton, it's all the same to me. I'm from Canada. -How's Lilly? -Oh, fine. She and Uncle Al send their love. Well, Aunt Lilly did. I really... I really hate to do this, but...you're Joan Collins, aren't you? -Yes, I am. -Oh! I knew it. I knew it. -Could I please have your autograph, Miss Collins? -What's your name? Oh, no, no, no, it's not for me. It's for my husband. So could you make it out to Ferdy? Ah, is that spelled with a V as in Verdi, the composer, or an F like in Philadelphia? No... He just got off the plane from Cleveland. It's really Fernando. He's...he's over there with his brother. He's 90. And he's seen all of your films. Oh, oh, I'll call 'em. Why did you do that? Because Joan Collins has worked very hard. I wouldn't dream of disappointing her public. Now, let's get the bags and get the hell out of here. Why didn't you tell that broad that you were somebody too? -Why didn't you tell her? -For your information, I am somebody. Well, why didn't you tell her you were Marguerite Sydney? -Sometimes I don't think I know you. -Maybe I'm not the person you wanted to know. I'm certainly not the same person that woman has already forgotten. -Or maybe you should just remember who you are. -In spite of everything... ...success, failure, divorce, marriage, illness... I still have enough of my wits to know that I am still somebody! Nice car, huh, Josh? -Ah, yeah, yeah...it's... -Real nice. -It's too bad it's not mine. -It's not mine, either, I'm sorry to say. Where is your car, mom? I sold it. Oh. Aren't we going to Beverly Hills? -Malibu. -I sold the house on Roxbury Drive too... ...and some furs and some jewelry. -Oh. -Hospitals are expensive. Yeah. Hey, Josh, your mom tells me you're tight with a buck. You must get that from your old man, huh? -Are we going to the Culps? -Yes, darling. Midge and Andy have been kind enough to loan me their house. Andy's in New York directing a film. They'll be home by Christmas. He should've given me that part. I was perfect for it. -He let you read three times. -Oh, he did that as a favor to you. He was afraid you were gonna ask him to read. I don't read. He offered me the part. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He got points for that. The way an agent calls you when he knows you're not home, so he can leave a message on the service. Why...why didn't you take it, mom? Wasn't it a very big part? No, it wasn't a very big part, baby, but I'd have taken it. The studio wouldn't insure me. Oh, I've always loved this place. So look, are we gonna go to Grant Tinker's cocktail party, or what? -Well... -Do us a lot of good, you know. Well, David, I would like to spend some time with Josh. Why don't you have a nice swim and get some sun. I'll call you later. I thought he'd never leave. Hey, Monkeyface! Come here. Ah, it's just one three ring circus around here, baby. One ape exits and one ape enters. Hey, Nelson. Penny. How you doin'? Huh? Miss Marguerite. Mr. Savage just called. -He wants you to call him right back. -Oh, God, let it be a job. -You hungry? -Yeah. Airplane food's not so good, you know. -Let's go to the kitchen. -Okay. Hey, Monkeyface, you look great. When, Jay? When? I can't hear you. It's noisier there than it is here. Shut up, Chauncey. Honey, it's the blow dryer. I'm getting a trim. Now listen, they want to take a meeting. Studio, Polo Lounge, whatever you want. They're trying to do this thing right. And they want to get a look at me. Now, they're not asking you to read. They're not asking you to test. -They just want to buy you a drink, babe, and... -Get a look at me. Well, honey, they're selling soap. They want people who'd look good. You're looking great, so what do you care? If they want to look, let 'em look. What about the insurance? No problemo they're willing to go for it. Honey, I'm telling you, these are nice people who want to do this thing right. So, okay? -Okay, Jay. -All right. What's your schedule like? Ah...well... Josh just got here. How's tomorrow for you? I know they're very eager to get this part cast. -Tomorrow's fine. -All right. Fabulous. Now listen, Marguerite, I want you to concentrate on the upside of this thing. Now, I know it's TV, but it's big-time TV. It's a class act and, honey, it is a go project. They want to do another Dynasty. -Is the role any good? -Good? Honey, instead of Colorado and oil, it's Mississippi and cotton. I don't know. It's a Faulkner saga. Now, Marguerite, trust me. Now, honey, I gotta go. I'm late for this meeting. It takes a while to get to metro. And a while to get out. Good news? Ah...maybe. I'm meeting with some TV producers. No promises, of course. Well, that's wonderful. Don't you want to call Merwin and tell him? Ah...not yet. I... I don't want to tell any of my friends, in... ...in case it falls through. Come on, aren't you excited? Just a little bit, maybe? I guess I am... I hardly know what I think anymore... Oh, of course I'm excited, baby. I guess I'll just be more excited after I know they really want me. Come on. MARGUERITE: Make sense, David. I can't go to Palm Springs tonight. I'm waiting to hear from Jay about the meeting. DAVID: Don't they even have the decency to set it 24 hours in advance? Who goes to a meeting called for the same day? Desperate people, that's who. They know you're down in your luck. They want to rub your nose in it. MARGUERITE: As opposed to some people I know. You're not gonna get it, you know. The part. They're just jerkin' you around. That's a terrible thing to say to me. I'm just being realistic for your benefit. Now can we just forget this thing -and go to Palm Springs? (DOG BARKING) Shut up! That's what you do always, isn't it? Run. DAVID: Shut that thing up. MARGUERITE: She'll shut up when you shut up. You want me to punch you out? -Oh, that's attractive. -DAVID: Rita, honey, let's be reasonable. Don't call me honey. And don't ever call me Rita. Why? Is that too cheap for you? People who know me call me Marguerite. People who think they know me call me Rita. All right. All right, then... Marguerite. We need a change of scene. -Just you and me. -I can't just run off and... ...and leave my son and the animals! Put 'em in a kennel. Put 'em all in a kennel! -MARGUERITE: Get out. -DAVID: What? I said get out. (DOG BARKING) Get off. Off. Get off. Hey! David! Quit it! David, quit it! Cut it out! Quit it! Come here. (DOG GROWLING) Come here. It's okay. It's okay. Shh...shh. Penny. Penny. Shh. Shh. It's okay. Penny, cut it out. Shh... Penny, it's okay. Marguerite, put that thing down. -Mom. -Are you crazy? Mom! Don't. Get out. Mom... Mom... Mom, calm, calm down. I don't want you to be sick again. -Mom... -I... -Did he hurt you? -Oh, God, no... no...not that time... -Was that loaded? -How would I know? I sure can pick' em, can't I? Well, I'll say. Even if dad didn't beat you up, he's still a loser. Don't say that. I won't hear you say a word against your father. He loves you. I suppose that's why you sign my birthday cards? He does love you. It's just that he has a lot on his mind and he... I know. I know. Come on. You gotta get to bed. You got to look your best tomorrow. Josh... I'm so proud of you. -Good night, baby. -Good night. MERWIN: Well, you're getting better. You're only half an hour late in your own home. Oh, shut up, Merwin. Where'd you get all this stuff? Melrose avenue. LA Has discovered arugula...and radicchio... and croissants. My God, you gotta fight your way into a croissant. Sinsiona told me about a horse that's running at Hollywood Park tomorrow. Here it is... Can you believe it? In the fifth race there's a horse called Rita's Heater. You're not thinking about betting, are you? Sweetheart, I'm not going to break into your piggybank. Marguerite, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about horse racing. Mom, it's so risky. Who do I know who can get us a table at the track? Mickey Rooney has horses. Maybe I ought to call him. Well, so does princess Ann. Maybe you ought to call her. Maybe you ought to bet on her. Merwin, be serious. -No, mom, you be serious. -Josh... How can you think about betting when all you have is that... Josh! That's enough. He has a point, you know. MARGUERITE: Josh? Josh? (KNOCKING) Come in. Come in! Joshee, I want you to be as direct with me as you like. There's no room in our lives together for pretense. Mom, give me a break. I do not confuse pretense with pretend. No matter what some doctors might say. There's quite enough pretend by the very nature of the town we live in. And much too much pretense. I don't confuse the two any more than I confuse passion and love. -No matter what you think. -Please... I love you and I want you to always say what's on your mind, But there's one thing which I will not tolerate, ever, -and that is bad manners. -Yeah, and right there I lose. -Why? -Well, because. No matter what I think, if I say something you don't want to hear, it's always considered bad manners. Even if I think I'm only being reasonable. Am I unreasonable? Mom...here you are in a rent...no, not even a rented house. A free house with a free maid having a free meal. You haven't got a job. You haven't got a dime, except for your last residual check, which you're thinking about gambling away. Now is that unreasonable? Is that pretense or pretend? You tell me because I don't want to make a mistake and be accused of having bad manners. Sometimes you frighten me. Sometimes you're like a little old man... (PHONE RINGING) A very short little old man. Mom. Mom. Mom, I'm sorry. MARGUERITE: Hello? Jay? What? A whole week? Oh, can't I go see them? Hell, I... I don't care about the Polo Lounge. I... I'll go to Burbank. Yeah... I know it's no good to appear too hungry. Thanks. Thanks. Bye. Mom, I'm sorry... MARGUERITE: Come on! Move it! Oh, no! Oh, well, it's the race after the next one that counts. Josh, you're so pale. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm just... I'm just a little anxious, that's all. Sweetheart... Any good for you, Ben? Afraid not, Charles. Excuse me. Are you who I think you are? I'm not sure. I'd hate to disappoint you, but I don't have a British accent. You're Marguerite Sydney, aren't you? -That's right. -Oh, this is wonderful. I like you very much. -Your work. My name is Ben Nichols. -Thank you. Hey, Charlie! Brought you a little drink. Thought you'd need one after that race. -Mickey! -Marguerite? Mickey, I don't believe it! I was gonna call you this morning. You always say you're gonna, but you never do. -Oh, Mickey, this is my son, Joshua. -Hi, Joshua. -Mr. Rooney... -How do you do? Nice to meet you. -Joshua, Mr. Nichols. And... -Charles Vanden Heuvel. -How do you do? -How do you do. Um, real estate? Beverly Hills? No, Pasadena. My cousin has Beverly Hills. Mom. I'm gonna be sick. -Josh! -I...think I'm gonna be sick. -Is there a restroom here? -Yeah, hang on. I'll... -What's the matter? -Josh... -No, I'm fine. -I'll get... -Here put this in some water... -I think he's going to faint. -Some water... -No, please, I'm fine. Honey, you didn't have... Oh, thank you, Mickey. I'll have the handkerchief -laundered and returned to you! -Forget it, Marguerite. Hey, Marguerite, I... I hope your career's going as good as you look! Mom. Is...is that your race? Did you miss that because of me? -No, baby. -He's all right. -It's the next one. -I'll get him a glass of water. Don't worry. Come on, I'm gonna take you home. -No. I'm fine. Let's stay. -Stay? I thought you'd be delighted to leave. I... I just... I just don't want to ruin things for you. Here's your comb. Thanks, Mr. Nichols. Appreciate it. -Ben, I mean. -Feel like you can eat something now? -Yeah. -Some soup maybe? -Do they have a tuna melt? -A tuna melt? Well, I'm feeling better, mom. -Oh, I believe it. -Well, why don't we sit down over here? Louie can get you anything you want. -You're pretty well known, aren't you? -You're famous. I'm infamous. According to the form, Rita's heater hasn't got a chance. She'd need a motor to win. -I don't care. I like her. -Well, it's your money. Here's to you. In her last race, she opened with a two length lead at the quarter pole, was ahead by a neck at the stretch, but by the end of the race, she was looking at the rest of the horses, -and I don't mean their noses. -You know a lot about racing, don't you? It's all here. You know how to read the form? Well, it's easy. I'll show you, if you'd like. -How do you know Mickey Rooney? -I don't. I just met him here with Charles. I'm with Vanden Heuvel in New York. You're in real estate in the east? Yes. I get out here on business quite a lot. I'm thinking about relocating. This is the day... And this ask the month... Well, I'd better place our bets. I'll talk to you about this later. Ah, could...could you cash a...a check? Between the parking lot, the guest fee, and the last race... I have money. You can pay me back later. How much do you need? -A hundred? Two? Five? -Ah...five would be just fine. Mom... Josh, darling, I'm not gonna put it all on Rita's Heater. I'm going to put four on Rita's Heater -and one in Rita's pocket. -God... -Okay, Josh? -He's fine. Ah, here's the check, Ben. S. A. G. Is good for it. I don't want anything back. You've been more than generous. It was nothing. You don't have to pay me now. Yes, I do. Here's my autograph. Don't frame it, cash it. Even though I'm grown-up, I still don't take candy from strangers. Even though we've just met, I wish you wouldn't think of me as a stranger. You know what I mean. Well, I'd better place our bets before it gets too late. What is she doing? Rita! Come on! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh... I picked that one just right. What the hell are you smiling at? Because... I've got the winner. And... I am going to frame that after all... Hello, Miss Sydney. Nice to see you again. -Hi, honey. Jay Savage. -Yes, good afternoon, Miss Sydney. -Hello. -Mr. Miller just stepped down the hall. -He should be back any minute. -Thank you. -Would you like maybe a little coffee or mineral water? -No, thanks. Yes. Miss Sidney's here. He'll be right with you. -Thanks. -All right, c'mon, baby, let's sit down. Now, don't be nervous. It's gonna be a piece of cake. You know, I made my first picture on this lot when I was four. My mother had seen an open call in Variety and we drove all the way here from Ohio. I got the part because I could cry on cue. I had to drop an ice cream and cry. It was the last one for Barrymore. He was so oiled he couldn't remember a line. It went to 24 takes and I didn't blow a line or... ...miss much, anything. Barrymore was quite terrified of me. But he liked me and he helped me. And I helped him. I'm not nervous, Jay. -Ronnie. -Jay. Marguerite. May I call you Marguerite? That's what I asked to be called. And what may I call you? I'm Ron Miller, the executive producer. Come on in. I'd like you to meet some of the other producers and some of the people from the network. Jay, if you don't mind... Well, people. Here she is. (GENERAL EXCLAIMING) Good to see you, Jay. Check out this great shot of McEnroe here. -He's actually smiling. -He is actually smiling. Hi, Scott. Hi, Josh. Heard you were back in town. -Oh, hi. -Hi, Tracy. Hi, Jennifer. -SCOTT: I hate Tracy. -You hate that? Then why do you date her? I don't know. I guess I like some kind of steady squeeze. SCOTT: Did you get the present for your mom? Yes. She had a big meeting and... I won some money on a horse. -Yeah? -Yeah. You know, I saw her on television the other night. Some old movie. -I mean she was hot. -Yeah. That must have been really scary for you that time. I mean, seeing her freak out and everything like that, I mean. And I'm really sorry and I'm glad that she's doing better and I'm really glad you're back. I missed you, too, Scott. It was like they'd called Screen Extras Guild to send over a room -full of yuppies. -Oh, I know. Your basic executive crowd scene, with togas by Armani. And since I've been out of it for a year, suddenly I'm a new face. Well, I'm certainly not gonna tell. And since they're new faces, they don't ask. Oh, of course, and since everybody has something to say and, of course, nobody has anything to say. Well, it's always been run by a committee, but this is absurd. Oh, is it any wonder that most of television is so bad? -And they assured me the network wanted me and... -Oh, of course... -...the studio wanted me... -Oh, sure. Well, how does -it feel to be on the most wanted list? -And they also said, would I mind if I just gave them a little taste... How dare they! Impermissible! What did you do? Give 'em a piece of your mind? -I gave 'em the works. -You didn't read? I looked at those fools and I thought, all they want is a story to dine out on. So what the hell: I read my tush off. -Did you get the job? -Who knows. They've probably already signed Ann-Margaret. Oh... You went and bought caviar to celebrate with Ben, didn't you? Ben's taking me out. That's all that counts. Oh, Merwin... -Does it show? -Just a tad around the edges. I've got to be honest, I didn't buy the caviar. The studio sent it to Andy Culp for the start of their picture program. MARGUERITE: I hope Josh is okay. He does nothing but mope around and talk to -the animals. -MERWIN: Well, that has it's advantages. At least they can't put you on hold. MARGUERITE: Be serious, Merwin. I'm worried about him. All he does is... ...is watch rock videos and read Stephen King. He has no friends, but Scott Tannen. -He never goes out. -Well, he's out now with Scott Tannen. Merwin... ...do you think he's gay? MERWIN: I think you ought to ask him. That's one thing you don't do, you know, communicate. Except in cryptic, unspoken signals. If he were, I... I'd feel guilty. I'd... I'd like to have grandchildren...later on. -And no more than two. -Oh, Marguerite... It would be so nice if you'd stop thinking about yourself for just five minutes. Think about your son. What he wants. And be happy he's happy, whatever it is. Oh, Marguerite. -HOST: Oh, good evening, Miss Sydney. -Good evening. -Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. -Welcome. -Ben Nichols. Ah, yes, Mr. Nichols. Right this way, please. -HOST: Here we go. -Thank you. Would you care for a cocktail before dinner? I think we'll have some wine. How about Batard-Montrachet? Very good, sir. Enjoy your meal. You look beautiful. Do you know how long I've been in love with you? You're not going to come at me with dates, are you? I had just finished law school... -You're a lawyer, too? -Well, I had just...quit law school. I was walking around Princeton. I had just been stood up by this girl. And I went to this movie house. Not caring, not knowing what was playing... It was the last show. It was half over. But you ruined my life. Oh, and I was hoping you'd say I'd saved you from that awful girl. Well, you did. But I got married anyway. And so did I. And divorced. More than once. -Did you get divorced? -Oh, yes. I'm so glad. Do you still want to save my life? Well, I certainly don't want to ruin it. Not again, anyway. You're a very nice man. I'm going to miss you when you go to New York. -Well, I'll be back. You can bet on it. -Is that a tip? It's a warning. No, I will not let you drive back to town in all this fog. What if there wasn't any fog? -You'll be staying in the guest room. -You're serious? What time would you like to be called? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're pretty fast on your feet, aren't you? -You're not bad yourself. -I learned it as a little girl. Sneaking out of hotels without paying the bill. I think Sinsiona put clean sheets on the bed. You know, most girls who walk me to the door usually expect a good night kiss. -Don't. -Why? We'll wake up Josh. Oh, is it because of him? -He'd love it if you stay. -Then what? I'm too shaky, Ben. -I wouldn't hurt you. -I'm used to being hurt. It's when I'm not hurt that I don't know how to deal with it. I need you, Marguerite. More than you need me. For a strong person, I have an amazing lack of will power. JOSH: Are you sure Mr. Vanden Heuvel doesn't mind us using this place? DAVID: Stop worrying. And hit the ball. Turn. Thatta boy. Good. You gotta meet the ball a little bit sooner. That's it. -You okay? -Yeah. You just hit 'em hard, that's all. Well, if you're going to be playing in a tournament with Scott, they're not gonna be hitting ping-pong balls at you. -JOSH: Guess not. -Ready? Yeah. Oh. You should anticipate when you see your opponent swing. That extra step can make the difference. -I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. -Ready? Why you little hustler. You been holding out on me? I bet you know all about the horses, too. Five and seven won the daily double. Does that tell you anything? Oh, oh. Yeah. I'm tired. Let's go home. So, did you send mom some flowers and say break a leg? That's what you say, you know. No, I didn't say that. But I did send her some flowers. From both of us. Thanks. She'll really like that, you know. She likes things that are personal. Well, you can trust me in that department. You know, I know that house is for sale, but do you think the owners would rent it? -What have you got in mind? -Well, now that mom's workin' we're probably gonna rent a place. And if we live there, I could quit Sammo and go back to Beverly. -So you could be with your friends. -Well, some of them. Yeah. Well, I'm afraid it's not for rent. Well, we could never afford to buy it. Probably couldn't afford to rent it, either. Not even with my savings in the newel post. -In the what? -Can you keep a secret? Come on, I'll let you in on something. -JOSH: Ta-da. -Well. You sly little fox. Well, a squirrel's more like it. I've known about this place since I was a kid. You have been making bets. -No, I haven't and that's why I've got this. -God, I wish I had a son -like you. -Careful or you might get your wish. -I mean that, you know. -Please don't tell mom about the stash. -She...sometimes she goes on these treasure hunts. -You have my word, Josh. I don't know, I guess I've...always been a little worried about the famous rainy day, even in California. Well, I can understand how you feel. So, I'm a miser. It's compulsive. My Uncle Al says it's practically sick. I wish I was more like you. You wish you were more like me? I wish it'd been the other way around. -You gotta have your buzz-off money, Josh. -Buzz-off money? Yeah, you gotta have your buzz-off money because of the freedom it allows you. How much money you have is not important. It's just the awful humiliation that comes from not having any. You always gotta have enough to say, I can do what I want to. -Buzz-off. -Oh, I see. Yeah, without it you do a lot of things you wouldn't ordinarily do. You compromise. You depend upon a lot of people you wouldn't otherwise associate with. You're insecure. Weak. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, I'll get it. Hello? Ah, yes he is. One second. -It's Vanden Heuvel's office. -Thanks. Sure. This is Mr. Nichols. Called today? Well, is that New York time or Los Angeles? No, I have the number. Thanks. If that party should happen to call back, well, never mind, I'll... I'll take care of it. Thank you. -What's the matter? -Nothing. Property I was working on didn't go through escrow. -Josh? -Yeah? How would you like it if I bought that house for all of us? Ah...don't...don't joke, Ben. Don't joke. I'm serious. MARGUERITE: Bye, Bobby. -Ah...that's...that's mom. -Can I...can I go tell her? -Oh, let me tell her. I'll... I'll find the right moment. We'll keep it our little secret -till then, okay? -All right. Thanks. See you Monday! Oh. What a week. Talk about grinding it out. Television brings new meaning to the words chopped liver. And that director...an acquired taste, which I have somehow failed to acquire. Oh, what are you two talking about? Were you talking about me? -Hi. -Would you like a drink? Oh, I'd love a glass of wine. Well? Oh, we were talking about that house where Josh and I play tennis. -I'd like to show it to you. -Are you trying to sell me something? I'm gonna take the steaks out to the grill. Okay? -Something I said or something I didn't? -Oh, he's fine. -How are you? -Oh, I'm exhausted. But exhilarated. You haven't read the script, but... Well, we're almost to the part where my husband dies and I inherit all the money. You could say it's a semi-happy ending. There are those who would say that if she gets the money, it would be a totally happy ending. There are always those. Oh! What a sky! Oh, my God! Isn't that magnificent? -I like to see you happy. -Oh...life. Isn't that incredible? Do you know where I was six months ago? In a locked ward, full of other people who'd lost their minds. You don't have to talk about it, if you don't want to. But I want to... I want you to know all about me. -I'm one of the lucky ones. -I'm glad you feel you can trust me. Some of them thought it was a sin to kill a fly. Others saw things or heard things. Some...talked to themselves or screamed all night. Or both. And there were the burned-out cases. Too many drugs. Too many shock treatments. Too much heat from life. -Marguerite... -My story's mixed up in there somewhere. What did you say about a...a house? -I'd like you to see it. -I'd like whatever you like. Yeah, that's a fantastic sky. MARGUERITE: (LAUGHING) Ben...the people next door can see us. BEN: Well...oh, well, there goes the neighborhood. You said you need me more than I need you. I'd say I'm as needy a person as you are. Then I'd say we were in this 50-50. And I'd say that's a new experience for me. And I'd say those are the best odds I ever had. That's a wrap! Get your call sheets for your call times in the morning and good night, everybody. Which ones did you print, Chris? Five and six. With a hold on three. Stop nudging, Rita, I'm not gonna make you look bad. I'd like to see them tomorrow. Look, I'd like to be up front with you, my friend. I don't allow the actors to see the dailies. Well, then I'd like to be up front with you. I'm not very happy about shooting my most important scene at nine o'clock at night. If this scene doesn't work, then nothing works. -Rita... -And you wait until I am exhausted. And don't tell me this is television. Look, I told you. I'm sorry that they brought you in just to sit around all day but I had to finish off the cattle call before I could get to you. What do you think of me, Chris? One of the hired help or is it one of the cattle? Oh, come on, Rita! I saw the work you did in the one with Kazan. You... Good stuff, Rita. I mean, you were good. But know what? In my picture, you're gonna be great. How many pictures have you done, Chris? Three, counting this one. Well, I don't count this one. This is a pilot, not a picture. I've done eighty-one, pictures that is. Marguerite, what's the problem? Ron, I want to see the dailies tomorrow. And if I don't like what I see I want to re-shoot it, preferably with my eyes open. Well, sure, darling. We'll... We'll have the film cassetted, so that you can watch it at home. Good night, Rita. Don't call me Rita, you UCLA reject. There's only one Rita, one Ava, one Marlene and one Marguerite. Now, then and forever! I have a terrific idea. Why don't we call you in late tomorrow? You better call a replacement for me tonight. Would you hold on just a moment, please? It's your husband. He's at the Chateau Marmont. -Mr. Nichols? -No, your husband. Oh. Thank you. Hi. Are you in Hollywood? Are you working? Great. Well, I could use a little child support. Oh, he's fine. He's back here with me. If you could try to see him, he... Well, when you get back from location... Please don't ask me for another loan. I could use one myself. I just walked off a film. Good bye. Good luck. -Thanks for waiting. -Oh, you're welcome. I left my costume on the inside. -I'll take care of it. -Thanks. -Have a good night. -Sleep tight, chief. Hot set, Miss Sydney. I know. I won't touch anything and I won't get you in trouble. Thank you, ma'am. It don't look so good now. It will look better in the movies. That's the trouble with life. No score and bad lighting. Marguerite, I think you ought to pay close attention to what Lee is trying to say. Marguerite, you still don't understand, babe. You are not walking out on them. They are walking out on you. The director wants the company to dismiss you and bring you up on charges with the guild. You are, in fact, fired! You're, in fact, not a hit. Now, Marguerite, we cannot allow you to take the position that you quit. Let Jay call the producer and tell them that you're ready and willing to work and consider calling the director and saying that it was all a heated misunderstanding. -Honey, I think Lee's right. -I will not come crawling. I will not turn into some unspeakably spineless hypocritical, apple-polishing two-faced phony! All I am asking of you is that you behave reasonably and act in your own best interests. Baby, this is a small town. Oh, beautifully put, Jay. I'm surprised you didn't say I'd never work in this town again. Or get out of town by sunset or something equally as original and scary! Marguerite, why are you doing this to yourself? Yeah, Mom, why? Okay. Okay. Whose hem do you want me to kiss first? Hey, kiss 'em all, babe. A phone call will be more than sufficient, Marguerite. Hopefully, they will accept it. If not, well, we'll go from there. Goodbye, Josh. Merwin. Awfully nice meeting you, too, Ben. I'm very glad that Marguerite has you here through all this. Thank you, Lee. Sure I can't offer you one for the road? Oh, no, no. I'd better have a rain check. I've got a lot of work to do. Say, we'd better get back to town and make that first phone call from my office. Fine, Lee. Whatever's comfortable for you. -Ciao, baby. -Goodbye, Jay. Okay, Marguerite. I'll give you a report as soon as we get the first word. We must all be very mature about this. Jay is what you'd call poisonously neat. And you are what you call digging your own grave. Haven't you heard? I'm back from the grave. And I will now sing Trees. -Mom. Mom? -Sweetie? -Mom. -Sweetie, are you all right? -Mom. -Oh, of course I'm all right. -Are you sure? -Oh, stop worrying. Merwin, you're such an alarmist. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Yeah. Ah, yes. Just a moment. It's Jay. He's calling from his car. Where else? Thank you, darling. Hello? You're not mad at me, are you, Jay? Good. What? Absolutely not. Under no circumstances. A proposal of marriage? He forgot something. He had a call from that television show, Hotel. Since I can't get a job till this mess is cleaned up would I mind if he sent Josh up for a three-day part. -Mom, I'd kill to do that. -Well, you'd have to kill me first. Why not? I mean, my father's an actor, you're an actor. That's exactly why they want you. Because you are my son. And that's exactly why I will not let you anywhere near this racket. And believe me, baby, it is a mean, sick, rotten, stinking racket. Yeah, I guess show business is pretty cheap. Now you wait a minute. Don't you dare say a word against show business. Motion pictures put a roof over your head and food in your mouth. Cinema is the art form of the twentieth century. Oh, somebody please open a window. Oh, goodbye, Ben. Bye, Joshee. Goodbye. -So long, sweetheart. -Bye. I'll call you later. You know, I'll probably never get another break like that. Give it a little time. If you still want to be an actor after you finish school, fine. You could even study theater arts in college, or film arts, or whatever. Or the cinema. That's what Mom's director has a degree in. Hey. Hey, you guys, come here. You hungry? Okay. Hey, hold on. I'm gonna go feed 'em. I'll be back. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? What? Oh, Lee, you're a saint! I don't know whether you want to be or not, but you are! Oh, thanks, Lee. Bye. Ben, you won't believe it. Lee's fixed it. I'm back on the show! Oh! I wish Lee called more often. Oh, and I don't even have to call that pig. He's gonna let bygones be bygones. He's gonna turn over a new leaf. God! God, I'm beginning to sound like Jay. Wall-to-wall cliche. -Oh! -You're beginning to sound like yourself. -What do you mean? -Nothing. Ben. That person you become when you have an audience. -Why, I love an audience. -It's somebody else. Somebody I don't know. Are you serious? Baby, you've got to have thick skin in this business. You've got to be tough otherwise you won't last a minute. They're just standing by, looking to put you away. Then why do you do it? Who needs it? I do, I suppose. It's all I've ever had to count on, good or bad. You really love it more than anything else, don't you? -Of course I love it. -Like a drunk loves liquor. Well, more like a baby loves its mother, I hope. Well, it's the same thing. Depends on how you look at it. No it doesn't. What's wrong with loving your profession? In Pasadena, they think movie acting is the second oldest profession. Oh, baby, baby. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. -Morning. -Morning, Sinsiona. Hi. Hiya, sport. Why aren't you at school? -It's not time yet. -Oh, yeah. My watch is broken. What happened? Oh, I was showing a house and the door jammed. -Not our house? -No. Not our house. You like your eggs all wiggly, huh? -Yeah. -You're weird, you know that? -Yes, I do know that. -You want some breakfast? -No, thanks. Just some coffee. -Oh, and did Mom tell you Lee smoothed everything over? -Yeah. That's great, isn't it? -I tell you, if I'm ever in trouble I want Lee on my side. What time's her call? Well, she's on location in Hidden Valley. She's got night shooting. -Right. Exterior mansion. -Her driver's coming around three. She's still sleeping. What time is it now? I don't know. Why, you got a plane to catch? -As a matter of fact I do. -What? -I'm going to New York. -For how long? Oh, not long. I've got a business deal to clean up. See my mother. -She's not feeling well. -Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't say anything. It's nothing serious. How are your kids, Sinsiona? Mine are all grown. The only kids I got left are right here in this house. Uh, Ben? Aren't you gonna say goodbye? Well, I wasn't leaving right away. Oh, I know, but I am. Scott and I are gonna practice this afternoon, so I won't see you. -Oh. -Don't say it. -Hey, I'm only gonna be gone a few days. -I know, I know. Um, Ben, you know you really touch easy. So does Aunt Lilly. My Mom, she... I'm very conscious of when she touches me. I think I'm a good toucher. I think so, too. -Bye. See ya, huh? -Uh-huh. Hey, have fun in the Big Apple. Goodbye, you animal. Be quiet, come on. That's a good doggie. Come on, that's a good boy. Shh. Be quiet now. Sinsiona! Sinsiona! -Sinsiona! -She's gone shopping. Ben! You might even be the prettiest girl in the neighborhood. -You missed your plane. -Are you sorry? I'll fix you some coffee. Do you hate me? Oh. No, Ben. But look at how I behaved. Darling, it was I who behaved badly. I was like a child with an over-indulgent mother. A brat out of control. I've never known you anything less than charming. Ever. Don't drink anymore. Come on upstairs. When you wake up you can take a nice shower and... (DOORBELL RINGS) Miss Sydney's car has arrived. Come in! -Hi, Bobby. -Hi. Could you take these to the car, please? Hi, Mr. Nichols. Hey, its fogging up pretty bad out there. Well, do you think the company will close down? No, they got a cover set. It's on the call sheet. -I'll be out in a minute. -Okay. Ben. Don't go now. You wouldn't like it if I asked that of you. No, I wouldn't. Don't ask that of me, Ben. Don't deny me that. It's so important to you, isn't it? Oh, Ben. It's like my heartbeat. Sometimes it's a little faster, sometimes it's very faint but it's something that's been there since before I can remember. And it'll be there until it's all played out. Do you have a love scene tonight? I don't know. I don't think so. It's not on the schedule. I do love you. Oh, and I love you, Ben. Go on, you guys, go on. Come on, Penny. Come on, Nelson. Penny! Nelson! Come on, let's go back to sleep! Oh, God. No. Please. Please. Ben? Ben? Ben! Ben. Stay back. -You found him here? -Yes, sir. And then you ran back to the house and locked all the animals in your room. And then you called Mr. Trellis. -Yes, sir. -Why did you call Mr. Trellis? Uh, Merwin? Well, Mr. Trellis is my mother's best friend and he's really good in situations like this. You've been in a situation like this with your mother before? No. No. He just... I mean when she's been in trouble. What kind of trouble? Like when she had the nervous breakdown and had to go to the hospital in Kansas. I see. Josh, why'd you pick up the gun? -I dunno. Instinct, I guess. -What do you mean? You know, if you drop something, you pick it up. You don't think about it. You just do it. -But you didn't drop it. -No. -Had you picked it up before? -Well, yeah, it was on the wall behind the bar. -Sure, I've touched it. -Did you know it was loaded? -No. -Did your mother? No. No, I don't think so. When was the last time you saw Mr. Nichols alive? Yesterday morning before I went to school. And what time did you get home? It was about seven. The news was on TV. About seven o'clock. What time did your mom get home? -I don't know, I was asleep. -Did your mom and Mr. Nichols have a quarrel? -No. -They never had a fight? -Never. -Never in front of you. -Not behind my back, either. -How would you know? I don't know, I just... Okay, I don't know. If they did, I'd never see it. Why was Mr. Nichols going to New York? He was going to see his mother. And on business. -What business? -Real estate. Did Mr. Nichols tell you his mother was alive? Well, isn't she? Did Mr. Nichols tell you that he worked for the Charles Vanden Heuvel company? He was one of Vanden Heuvel's partners in the east. We were... We saw one of their houses together. We were going to be married. Miss Sydney, Mr. Nichols' mother is deceased. Mr. Nichols was unemployed. Mr. Nichols was also married. -That isn't true! -To Charles Vanden Heuvel's sister. They lived in New York. I don't believe you. -Did you know about Mr. Nichols' gambling? -No. Did he tell you about his debts? Did you know about his losses? Captain Clymer, perhaps you'd better continue this discussion later. Miss Sydney needs to rest. All right, fine. She can rest for now. But I'll want to see her downtown. I have some further questions. Mom? Are you okay? Honey, it's you I'm worried about. I'm okay. What did the police ask you? Probably the same things they asked you. What did they ask you? Things about me? Just like where you were and stuff like that. What time did you get home last night? Late. Did the driver come in with you? No. I woke up and thought I heard talking. I couldn't unwind. I turned on the television. That must be what you heard. No, mom, I thought I heard Ben. You must have dreamt it. Yeah, I guess so. Don't you believe me? I guess I just don't know where one nightmare begins and another one ends. Mom. Mom. Oh, baby! I don't believe it. I wonder if he knew. If he knew how much I loved him. Shh. It's okay. Shh. Nice of Lee to send the car, wasn't it? Not all the men in my life have been bad news. Not you not Ben. In my life, he was something different. And I was different when I was with him. He was a gentleman. A gentle man. He was a real human being. Which in this town is rare. We're here, sweetie. Keep cool. And keep moving. Miss Sydney. Miss Sydney. Clear the way. Clear the way. Miss Sydney has nothing to say. Would you just clear the way, please. The studio reports that you wrapped at 12:42 a.m. The studio report... The studio report also says its driver dropped you at the Culp place at 1:50 a.m. Does the studio report also say what time I went to sleep? Miss Sydney, are you familiar with a bar called the Sea Siren? It's near the Malibu Inn. I've never been there myself. Did you know that Mr. Nichols went there frequently? I did not. The owner says that on the morning in question Mr. Nichols left the Sea Siren at 1:45 a.m. in the Culps' Corvette. Now providing he did not break the speed limit, he arrived at your house at 2:00 a.m. Did you hear a car come in the drive? -No, I did not. -Was there a car in the garage when you got home? Oddly enough, I did not look in the garage before I went to bed. That tone is gonna get you nowhere, Miss Sydney. -Neither will yours, captain. -Oh, really? What is my tone? -Snide and insinuating. -And yours is insulting and contemptuous. I'm not here on trial. Or am I? I understand it's a tone for which you're very well known. Especially when you work, according to the director of your pilot film. And sometimes in private, according to... What's his name? -David Hollis. -Yes, Mr. Hollis. Now, are you sure that you and Mr. Nichols didn't have a fight? I am positive! Did you know that Mr. Nichols was a devout Roman Catholic? No. His brother-in-law said he would never take his own life. It is against the Catholic religion and completely against Mr. Nichols' character. I was unaware that his brother-in-law was a psychoanalyst! Mr. Nichols' fingerprints were not on the gun, Miss Sydney. He was wearing gloves. What is your point, captain? My point, Miss Sydney, is that the only prints on the gun were yours and your son's. Now, your son said he picked up the gun when he discovered the body. When did you pick it up? Can we get through, please? -I have to go to her. -Maybe you shouldn't. I must say something. Mrs. Nichols, how long are you going to be in Los Angeles? Mrs. Nichols, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I have a house in town, a house in the country two Mercedes and a yacht. And I have nothing. It's all right, sweetie. It's okay. It's all right, sweetie. -Oh, God. -It's okay. Where the glamorous star has come in for questioning regarding her fiance's apparent suicide. The big question from the police is why no suicide note? Miss Sydney has been attempting a comeback with the new nighttime soap. She is once again the center of attention. This is Michelle Carson. Who is it? It's only me. I brought you some tea. Get the dogs out of here. And go get Ben. Um, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up? I want to see Ben. Mom, Ben's not here. I want Ben. Mom... Mom, Ben's gone. He's... Will you stop saying that! Go and get him! I want Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Mom. Mom. God! No! No! No! Ben! Help! Help! Get a doctor! Please. Hurry. Get a doctor. Please. -What happened? What's going on here? -Would you mind moving back? I just seemed to slip through everyone's fingers till he came along. But he turned out to be just like all the rest. No, no. Josh, he loved you. He loved your mother, too. He just wasn't a survivor like us. Listen, suicide's not the answer. -You know that, don't you? -Yes. Please. Merwin, can I stay with you? I mean, I could get a job. I'd love it, but the courts would never hear of anything so reasonable. Besides, your Aunt Lilly needs you to stay with her. I wonder if I'll ever get out of Elliston, Ohio. Oh, my God. You've no idea how ugly it is there. Oh, I've been to Yugoslavia. I can imagine. Will you visit the dogs in the kennel? -I promise. -I'm glad Sinsiona took Monkeyface and Chauncey. Oh, Chauncey. You know, I wouldn't have minded Chauncey. To be perfectly candid, it's probably just the thing I've been looking for. Hey. Hey. Don't tear yourself apart about your mother. She's in very good hands. Do you think she did it, Merwin? No. No, I don't. Even at her spectacular worst, she would never do murder. Well, they couldn't get her for it now, anyway, could they? Not to worry. The doctor said rehabilitate's not the problem. Habilitate's the problem. He said she's the most immature person he's ever come across. She's always been a splendid child. He also said that she was going to call me and that I shouldn't let it upset me because he said she'd try to... Well, I did... She didn't call. Josh, I'm so sorry. I know. I've gotta go. No tears. We're grown men. Give me a hug? Oh, you know I'd wait, but I've got a date and I've gotta lose 60 pounds by 7:30. -Bye. -So long, kiddo. My God! Merwin! Wait! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Thank you, Ma'am. Ma'am. Excuse me. Thank you. Malibu. Just past the pier. Just before the colony. I'll show you the house. Well, that... That's gonna cost you, you know. I don't care. Go. I got it. Oh, Ben. Thanks. Mom, how are you? Oh, I'm fine, baby. What are you lookin' at? I'm looking at the sky. Such a beautiful violet. That's the magic hour. -Are you feeling better? -Yeah. Are they nice to you here? Well, there's no room service. They call it therapy. There's nothing quite as reassuring as lovely light. Except maybe a plate of pasta. Mom, I found a note. Two notes. There's one for me and one for you. Do you want me to leave it here with you? They don't let me keep anything here. Okay. I'll keep it for you. Would you read it to me? &quot;Dear Marguerite. &quot;As I failed my entire life, I failed you. &quot;I won't ask forgiveness. &quot;Only that you know I love you. Ben.&quot; Charm rolled off him like a halo off a fallen angel. You know he came back that night, don't you. You knew it all along. I know you didn't tell the police. I didn't, either. I was afraid they wouldn't believe me. Nothing really happened. We argued about nothing. You don't have to worry, Mom. I'm gonna give these notes to Lee. What does yours say, darling? Well, it's personal. I love my boy. I love you, too. Dear Josh. You know the old joke about the man who had twin sons? One was an incurable pessimist, the other an incurable optimist. The father was stumped, so he tried an experiment on Christmas eve. He put the pessimist in a room with everything a kid could wish for and he filled the optimist's room with horse manure. Then he looked in on them to see how they were doing. The pessimist sat there in the middle of the toys and clothes and sporting goods. Just sat there, staring at everything suspiciously trying to figure out what the catch was. Then he went to the optimist's room and peeked in. There was the other boy, standing waist high in all that manure shoveling it over his shoulder and laughing. &quot;Hey,&quot; the father said &quot;What are you so happy about?&quot; The kid turned to him and said &quot;Well, Dad, I figure with all this crap there must be a pony.&quot; So, Josh, don't do as I did. Do as I ought to have done. Hunt for the pony I couldn't quite locate. And even if you never find him, you'll live your life looking. It's more fun that way. Love, Ben.
