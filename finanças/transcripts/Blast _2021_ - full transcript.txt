BLAST Come on! Come on, honey, let's go. - Go on, Zoé. - I don't like cars. It's only going to be 10 minutes. Come on! Noah, get in the car. Get in, Zoé. Buckle up. Hurry up. What's happening? What is this? It's me. I can't start your car. Can you come down? It'll be easier. I know, but it doesn't work. Come and help me, please. Yes, thanks. You can't start a car? How funny... Dad's lame. Yeah. MINE-CLEARING AND TRAINING REPORT - Here you are! - I have to do everything! - So you can't start my car? - It seems so. It's actually not that complicated. This is a steering wheel. There, you've got the gearbox. - And down there? - The pedals. - Did you hear about it? - Pedals... There's also a door. Go on, move! This. What? I can't understand your dad. - I can't either. - You can't? Hurry up. Go on, Sonia. - Sonia? - Nobody move! Sonia? - Hello? - Why can't we move? Mom, what's this countdown? Sonia! Move away! Don't touch the door! Nobody touch anything! Do you understand? Look around the car, and tell me if you see something. Are you kidding me? Kids, listen to me carefully: you can't get off that seat. Move as little as you can. Got it? Yes. Why can't we move? Not now, Noah. What is it? Should I get help? I'm calling Igor. I'm calling the cops. Definitely not! I trust Igor. He'll know what to do. OK... Igor, I'm sitting on an IED. I'm stuck in my car with Noah and Zoé. Fred is outside. we can't get out of the vehicle. A 27 minute countdown, and a printed circuit connected to the on-board computer. No, I can't see the main charge. There's a small case under the car. I'm sending you the pictures. So what is it? It must be the safety delay. Must be... You don't know? That's why Igor's coming. Don't worry, we're handling this. OK... Check under the car if there's anything else unusual. What is this? An anti-tank mine. Is this a sick joke? Wait... There's a bomb? Are we going to die? Nobody's going to die. Bombs are my job. Igor's coming, we'll handle this together. No honey, what are you saying? Everything will be fine, don't worry. I know you guys are afraid, but... Fred and I are here. You have to trust us. I need you on this. OK? Yes. Yes? Let's say we're in a big submarine with lots of nice fish all around. But there's a big problem. A leak. And if the crew panics, we'll never be able to go back up. Can you do that for me? Zoé? We're in a submarine, and we're underwater. OK, what can we do? We need to find the leak. Our leak. It could be wires, a box, anything that shouldn't be in this submarine. Move as little as possible. I found the periscope. WHO ARE WE? OUR MISSION Look, it's the crew. Yes, it was in Ukraine last summer. Mom saved a village. Look, there is Igor, Mom, and François. Focus, kids! I'm calling François. It's coming from in here. Zoé! Look at me! Look at me, stay with me. Noah, close the backseat. Noah, close the backseat! Think of the submarine. We're in a submarine. - Igor. - Hi. And inside? The countdown? Are there any wires? No, we checked, no wires, but there's a body in the trunk. It's François. Show me what you filmed. Wait, pause it... Getting into the car activated the arming system. but the "pressure-release" system has been modified for our weight. We can't get out of the car... Do you know how to defuse it? Camille has to do an evaluation and X-rays. Turn off your phones and anything that sends radio waves. How do you think we called you? If waves trigger the detonator, it'd already be activated. We don't have time for this, Igor. We don't have time! 15 min to get here, 5 to put on the bomb suit: 20 minutes! Igor! Fred can help you! He's here. She's right, Igor. I can help you. One mistake and everything blows up! You have no idea... Igor... Igor! Hello? My family is in danger. In the parking garage, at 11 rue Pasteur... If something happens to them, you'll be responsible. You do exactly as I say. Alright? Give me the U-shaped pliers. I've got the hose ready. Give it to me. What's going on? Nothing, I'll take care of it. Pass me the sleeve clamp. There's a Demine-ter breakout box. Are you kidding? Fuck! Noah, I need you to search François! In there? It's important. I can do it, if you want. It's alright, I'll do it. Slowly. I can feel something. Take everything. Get the robot ready. I'll take care of the parking garage's time switch. I can't grab it. I think I've got it. What the... What is this? Motherfucker... Before Ukraine, we had supplier issues, and now, we've replenished. What do you mean? A commission is targeting Demine-ter. I'm in touch with a girl from the embassy, Nina Drez, who investigates corruption cases. When I told François, he said I was worrying over nothing. You know what? You're going to call her. I need info to understand this trapping. It has to be related. OK. Hello? It's Fred Millet from Demine-ter, call me back as soon as you can, it's urgent. Be careful not to douse the kids with those X-rays. Easy, Sonia, I know my job. Cut the blue one to stop the countdown. The analysis shows we need to shunt it here. No, I know this type of model, we have to bypass the blue wire! No, the yellow one. The blue one is the ground and the green one is a decoy. - No! - The green's a decoy. Listen! You need to cut the blue wire! I know what I have to do, let me handle this. Sonia! I agree with Igor. I know your kid and the girl are inside, but get your shit together. Igor, time is running out. Don't do this! Fuck, it's a decoy! Igor! Look! The robot. Slowly, don't touch the door. Come on, come on... What are they doing? Fuck! Are you sure it's not a decoy? Cut. Fuck... I told you it was a decoy! Cut the blue wire! It's the power supply. I'm positive! Move Telemax! Igor! Cut the blue wire from the detonator, it's the only way! Igor! Igor, are you listening? Shut the hell up! It's going to fucking blow! Shit! Shit! Fred go away! Cut the blue wire! It's going to fucking blow! Igor! Fred, back up! Back up! Back up! I've told you to back up! Fuck. I told you so... It was the green one. You're not a bomb disposal expert right now, let us do it. I'm proud of you. Very proud of you. It's gonna be OK, I promise. What's with the shaking? I thought it was over. Igor! I know it's Sonia in the car. I know it's hard. But she's not thinking straight. She's with her family, not at work. You need to trust us. The countdown has stopped, but the pressure release is still on. They still can't get out of the vehicle. Dad! Zoé, don't touch the door! Zoé! Zoé, you can't get out. Not yet. - What? - Will it be over soon? Just a little longer, sweetie. Just a little longer. Nina? Yes. I need your information about Demine-ter. My family is danger, there's is a bomb. OK. 11 rue Pasteur, in my building's parking garage. Thanks. 40... 4... LG... 0... 25... TI... 22... 1,1,1... 3... Kids, calm down! The backseat is moving. Help me! Help! Sonia? What is it? Where are we? Do not move! We're trapped! What... There's an UTC 62 under the car. Call homeland security and some backup, we have to secure the area. And see if there's a video surveillance system. Block the access to the parking garage. You need to pack up and leave. Evacuate the building, we will handle the bomb. I'll explain the procedure to you. We secure the area until the bomb squad gets here. You're not in your jurisdiction, you have to leave. I'll explain the situation to you. It will take them at least 30 or 40 minutes to get here, then they'll have to start all over again. Do the evaluation again, the X-rays... They can't refer to someone else's method. Down there, there are two UTC 62s. You need at least a MINEX 4 credential to come near it. We have it. And we are used to working with these anti-tank mines. We can't wait for them. There's no time. If we wait for them to get here, it will be too late. Do you understand what it means? These are our colleagues in there, with their children. We can't leave them there and not do anything. Let us work. We'll get them out of there. How's it going in there? Kids? What are you doing in the trunk? I don't know... I don't know, I just woke up... I don't remember anything. Were you attacked? Yeah. It seems... What else do you remember? I... I did the reports last night. I left the office late. I was walking to my bike and then... Nothing else... They surely knocked me out. My kids are here, we need an urgent solution! It's dangerous to stay here. Nobody can be around this car. Please. - Are you the one who called? - Yes. Follow me. OK, spit it out, what's the story? I had a meeting last night to... I had to pay a guy. I brought the money, and then I got knocked out and... What is this bullshit? François? François! I took money from Amantis on our last mission. And? We cleared the mine south of Donetsk. There was uranium below it. Amantis wanted to exploit it. They needed secure ground... They threatened to tell the authorities, unless I brought them money. Tell me. The area is secure, we're evacuating the building. I've sent Nico over to Demine-Ter. The video surveillance here is kaput. I'll go set up ours. Is this your wife and your kids in the car? No, my wife died in an accident. I'm dating Sonia. We met at Demine-ter. Do you live together? Yes. She kept her apartment, but she lives at my place. Does Demine-ter have a good reputation in the field? Do you have enemies? No, I don't think... Generally we're the ones saving lives, so... Are there tensions inside the company? No. Igor and Sonia are the best friends in the world. And we don't have problems. What about you? I'm an accountant, not a bomb disposal expert. The woman I love and my kids are in that car. Things need to move forward. We're going to take care of this. - Don't worry. - Thanks. Do a fingerprint search. Were you in Ukraine? I don't want to leave them alone, I'm going back there. Your colleague's helpful. I understand why he doesn't talk about it. A country full of crazy people. I've never met so many lunatics. The militiamen are surrounded by mines, and when they're dismissed, they don't transmit their positions. Get the picture? One day, a man forgot where he planted mines. End result: 2 militiamen dead plus the guy who planted it. I'd love to keep on with this conversation... but we have a more urgent situation. In bomb disposal, we have to anticipate every single option. For now, the only thing we're sure of is the power of the explosives. - What are you getting at? - Look. The vehicle is very close to the gas main. Destroying it will magnify the explosion. We must move the vehicle. This pillar, it's gas. We're in a danger zone. We have to move the car. What? Wait, wait! - What does it mean? - It's procedure. What procedure? Nobody moves this car! This is insane! We don't take orders from a guy who sits at a desk all day. Really? Tell that to the kid who died in Ukraine. Someone died? No, Zoé, nobody died. Isn't that right? Sonia... Igor's good, but he's not infallible, we know that better than anyone. DEMINE-TER DEMINES IN UKRAINE Look at this. Demine-ter has done mine clearance in the Donbass warzone, and Amantis has a nuclear power plant project in Ukraine. Even better, a military guy named Sergueï Zarkov issued a statement 3 months ago against the Ukrainian government. Look at this. I declare war on all the bastard immoral nuclear-power industries that destroy our lives, and do so every single day. Screw the Amantis and their minions who want our uranium. Call Interpol. Check with the border police if he entered the country. Also call the Internal Security. Defusing bombs for colleagues, there's nothing worse. Yeah. Especially Sonia. Ready for the cross-check? The last memory I have of Mom is when she left with her car. She said: "Goodbye sweetheart", and she gave me a big kiss. That's why I don't like cars. Don't worry, we're going to get out of here. Mom and Igor, they're the best. My dad too. He won't leave us here. Everything OK for me. Ready? 3, 2, 1. It's going to be OK. From now on, nobody move. I don't feel well. Me too. Want to take a selfie? Yes. Let's take a picture then? Yes? Zoé? Noah? Yes. On 3, make a funny face. - Yes. - 1... 2... 2 and a half... - You too, François. - 3! Alright, slow down. Stop. Let's check it. It's OK. Let's lift the cover, then I'll go move the pick-up. You can't stay here! Move! It's dangerous. Sonia. Yes? You know I'd like you to become my second mom. Really? Even though Dad says it's not good to get attached. Dad told you not to get attached? Yes, you're a bomb disposal expert. You could die. He doesn't want me to be sad again. But I'd like it if we were a real family. Like before. Dad, Mom, and me. And I'd have a brother too. 1, M, K... 1, 00, 9... Those are the same! U, R, 0, 6, 2... The numbers are looping. 2, 5, 0, 2, S... François! We're trapped! - Stop moving! - Sorry... So? I managed to tamper with the tare. We've got 90 pounds. I'll evaluate the car doors. A woman outside wants to talk to Fréderic Millet. Let her in. We're in the middle of a crisis. You're making things worse. I'll explain it to you later, with calm... It's really calm, here. You took money from Amantis! Do you even realize? What can I say? I did what I had to. I did what I had to so the company could survive. - Survive? - Yes. Talking about survival is great as we sit on a bomb. You're totally crazy, François! Sure... It's always easy for Igor and you to lecture me. But hey, it's normal... You're the heroes. The saviors. Let me tell you one thing: if you want to play cowboy, a dumbass needs to stay here to find clients and keep the place running. And that's me! I'm working while you're getting your adrenaline high saving strangers worldwide. My adrenaline high? Are you kidding? - Do you think it's a game? - What is it? Do you think it's a game? Sonia, do you think we're naive? Aren't you addicted to danger? Those 3 months of work to save your relationship? Remember that? You begged me to send you back on the field. - Stop it, François! - You want me to stop? You asked me to lie to your ex, so that he felt that he had to let you go back. You and Igor, you never could take sensible decisions for the company. I had to take it all on myself, to keep you from behaving like little kids! Children! So don't start lecturing me because I made one bad decision. What's with the drama? Are you serious? There's two kids in the car. Stay focused. I'll prepare the water cannon. I'm sorry. Sorry. We have to hit the battery to unlock the doors. OK. TERROR IN UKRAINE: MILITIAMEN MASSACRE A SCHOOL, TURNING IT INTO AN OUTPOST Nina? Fred Millet. I'm happy you're here. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, despite the circumstances. I'm Major Feller. What are you doing here? Mrs. Drez contacted me a while ago to ask me questions about Demine-ter. I'm investigating a corruption case. The nuclear power company, Amantis, might've paid people off to clear mines and exploit areas rich in uranium. We think they paid Demine-ter to decontaminate the zones they're interested in. I know the case well. If your bomb is connected to it, I'll be of use. - Did you find it? - Wait a second... Opening and superlocking controls... Fuse 14. Don't get it wrong, this could blow it all up. Fuse 14. 14... For the windows: number 3. - Number 3? - Yes. Wait, wait! Let me check! Yeah. Yes, number 3. - Number 3? You're sure? - Yeah. Sonia! What's this? What did you do? Sonia! You must create a short circuit between this transformer and this relay. You have to make it quick. How? The doors and windows are closed! I don't have anything to create a short circuit. Nothing... Could you use that? Whatever you do, don't shunt it before you've made the bridge. Good! OK... With Camille, we're going to disrupt the power source, so we can open the doors. You need to talk to Fred. OK. It's ready. I'll help you with the bomb suit. Igor. There's no debate. You have to wear it. Or I'll go myself. How is Zarkov involved? Demine-ter came along without really considering the situation there. To Zarkov, you are a provocation. My kids are innocent, they have nothing to do with this. In my country, children die every day. Because of the war, landmines, militia groups and all of your good intentions. They're my daughters. This photo is all I have left of them. Their only crime was going to school. You French people, you don't even know what's really going on in Ukraine. A three-hour flight from Paris. That's what I stand up against: government crooks who get bribes, companies like Amantis who cash in on the war. Your daughter... like mine, they're collateral damage. That's what they told me when they gave me the bodies. Mr. Millet? Sonia is FaceTiming you. Thanks. Hey. How are you? I'm OK... Are you? Yes. Listen... Camille managed to shunt the tare, we've got 90 pounds. OK... 90 pounds means one child. Wait, what do you mean? It means we can get either Noah or Zoé out. Fuck... I don't know, 90 pounds... Zoé doesn't weigh much, can't we try to get both of them out? We can't. This isn't real. It's my daughter and the kid I've been looking after! What can I say? We need to make a decision. So you're not going to give me an opinion, right? It's my choice? You got us in this situation. This is all your fault! I don't care! Find another solution! I have no choice. They need me as a bomb disposal expert, not as a mother. I've already lost Anne, I can't lose Zoé. Zoé then, right? - OK, Zoé gets out. - Sonia... She's the youngest. This is the most sensible choice. Sonia... Fuck! You didn't stand up for me! You suck. Noah... Listen... I have to stay neutral, even for you. You don't love me... You don't give a shit about me. Noah! It's always your fucking bomb disposal first! Let this bomb explode! My death wouldn't make a difference. I do love you. You can get out if you want. Hey. Show me your numbers. Thanks. What if it was one of the people you trained over there? What? Maybe one of the guys you trained could have done this. - Yes? - Fred. Please check in the files the staff that we trained in Ukraine. They had access to our equipment. OK. Look. We found this at Demine-ter's headquarters. You must have a good explanation for this. We're busy with an operation. Following the explosion of a mine in Ukraine, and despite Mr. Kovac Igor's repeated efforts to clear it, a child died. Following protocol, Mr. Kovav consulted a certified psychotherapist. If every expert who couldn't clear a mine had to stop working, there wouldn't be many of us left. Mr. Kovac is showing psychomotor problems, tremors, due to the psychological shock. Shrinks don't know what they're talking about. They don't know we have to get back on the field. It's the only way to overcome our traumas! Or else we'd think about it every day. Mr. Kovac asked to be transferred to the office. Igor made that request himself. Fear, we live with it every day. We fight it every time we get close to an explosive. 3,500 degrees in 1/10,000th of a second if you blow it, that's something. Do you know our motto? Your first mistake will be your last. So yes. Igor can choose to quit and still be able to take it on himself to save his friends! You should understand that as a police officer. No? Is there a problem? No problem. What about you, Major? Do what you have to do. - Everything OK for you? - OK! Nobody in the car move! We're going to disrupt the box. 3... 2... 1... Don't move! Everybody stays here for now, nobody moves. Zoé. You need to come to me, very slowly. Take off your seatbelt. You're not mad, Noah? I don't want us to fall out. I'm not mad at you. You can go. Zoé, I'm just here, go on. Come with me. Go on. I'll get you two next. I hate you! A loving mom would've picked me! Slowly, Noah. Please calm down. Listen to me! Your mother knows exactly what she's doing. She's the best professional. Now... She loves saving people, what can you say? I don't care if my mom saves the world! I've been getting bullied at school. Nobody knows. Fred picks me up, not you! I want a real mother. One who picks me! Easy! - Why didn't you tell me? - You're never there! Do you think it's easy to just sit here waiting for you? I never know when you're leaving or coming back. When the phone rings, or when Dad receives a message, I think you're dead. Can you imagine? No, you can't imagine! - Noah... - Don't touch me! Well... - Is that the price for having kids? - Shut up, François. Are you OK? Are you hurt? Thank you. Come on. Let's go. Fuck! Why is it doing this? - Igor, there's a problem. - What? The firing pin is getting closer. It's 46 pounds lighter, so it should be there. Something's not right. - Forget about the bomb. - What? We can't defuse it on time. The area is secure, the doors are open. With Zoé out, we have 46 pounds of leeway. It's plenty enough. We forget about the bomb, and we get them all out. - How? - Look! We'll hook a weight to the axletree. Then throw the weight in the trunk. Exactly. Look! It's Zarkov. His name is Vlado Zhukovsky. Demine-ter trained him. Igor trained him. AMANTIS THREATENED IN UKRAINE Run a check on this Zhukovsky. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Look! There are numbers and 2 letters. It loops every time. Show me. 12, 21, 20, 11. 20-11... 20/11/2011! 12/21/2011. NK. December 21st of 2011? NK? What... Wait! 08/30. 2, 20/09. 08/30, 20, 09, GL. August 30th of 2009. December 21st of 2011, August 30th of 2009. Sonia! Noah's right, he found out! Those are dates! How many are there? If Zarkov has worked with us, we may have more recent prints. I can cross-check it with our files. Franck, pass him the keyboard. Thanks. I got an idea to help them. Would you come with me? Here. Zoé... Excuse me. Zoé! Zoé! Feller here. Are you sure? OK. Shit! Zarkov was killed 2 months ago. Oh no... Nina! Bring this to Sonia, sweetheart. Do it for me, please. OK? What are you doing here? Go. Do it. Don't move! Zoé, if you don't bring this to Sonia, I'm going to kill your dad. One more step and he dies! Put the weapon down! Don't move! We can settle this without violence. I'm dropping my weapon. You still have the choice. Think of your children. Think of Noah. Of Zoé. Fuck. What was that? Drop your weapon! Do you want another dead body? You're alone, there's three of us. We're just going to wait for Zoé to give my present to Sonia. Zoé. Come. Come here. The parking garage is surrounded. - Give that to me. - You've got no chance. Zoé! Where are you Zoé? Zoé, listen to me: you're gonna stay hidden! Zoé! Where are you? - It's Sonia. - Put it on speaker. Natalya, whatever you blame us for, Fred's got nothing to do with it. Tell me what you want. So now what I'm saying matters? In Ukraine, you didn't give a shit about my opinion! I begged you not to clear the mines around the school. Zarkov killed them all, but you've got all those deaths on your conscience, Sonia. Now you're gonna pay! Zoé! - Natalya! - Zoé, I want to see you! Natalya, listen to me! Listen to me! You said you're a loyalist who loves Ukraine. But how'd you help? Are you setting a good example? Would your children be proud of you? Your kids are dead because you're a coward! A fucking coward! - Stop it, calm down! - Mom... Holy shit! Camille! Camille! I'm here. I'm holding the pressure release. Go get the weight, I'm stuck. OK. Zoé? Everybody leave the area! OK... I'll put the hook, you handle the crane. I'll leave with the others. - You'll have no time to get out! - We're doing it this way. Shit! Those dates... are dates of birth. And the letters are initials. 34 dates. 34 dates of birth. They were children. And they... They killed children. That's it. Children died because of us. This can't be true. I couldn't... I couldn't have known. I couldn't have known, but who... Who would have thought that the mines protected them. They protected them from Zarkov. I couldn't imagine that it was... It was a school. It was a school. I didn't know. I didn't know... OK. Everything's set. You all have to get out of the vehicle at the same time. I'll count to 3. You get out when I say "go". Ready. OK. Let's go! 3... 2... 1... Go! Igor! Noah hasn't moved! Noah! - No. - Noah! Noah! - Noah, you need to get out, buddy! - Noah, get out! Sonia, stop! What are you doing? Noah! Your mother's waiting for you. Noah. Do you hear me? Look at me, please. Noah, please look at me. Listen to me. Look at me. Noah... I don't want another child on my slate. Not you. OK? Your mother needs you, she can't live without you. Come on. Give me your hand. Slowly. There you go. Come on. Come quickly. Come on. There! Igor! Igor... Put the weight back, Igor! Come on. Igor? Go. No, come with me. Get out of here! I can't go on. There's nothing to do. - I'll try to put the weight back... - We don't have time! Shit! Sonia! Listen to me! Think of your kid! Camille! Igor... Get her away! Go away, I can't do it anymore! - I can't do it anymore... - Sonia, get away! IN THE DONBASS REGION, MORE THAN 750 SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. ONLY 4% OF THE REGION HAS BEEN CLEARED OF MINES. 2 MILLION CIVILIANS LIVE IN MINED AREAS. EVERY HOUR IN THE WORLD, A MINE CAUSES ONE CASUALTY. ONE OUT OF FOUR IS A CHILD.
