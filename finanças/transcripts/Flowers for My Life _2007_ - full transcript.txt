B.O.N F u n S u b s ? ~ Band Of Nuts F u n S u b s Presents ~*Flowers For My Life*~ Translator mookie Spot Translator purpletiger86 Timer lilas Editor melica QC lovewls Encoder doggieusa Coordinator SeReNiTy How long have you been there? Ho-Sang! I also know that my daughter has made a serious mistake. She found a rich man with a short life span, to transform her life. There is no greater sin than this. I think that we're brought together by fate. No matter where this man goes, I'll be following him. Why are you doing this to me? - Because I love you. - Love me? Staying the night in his room... was completely my choice. You'll never be lonely, even when you die, or after your death. I'm still Dae-Bak's chewing gum, I will always be Dae-Bak's chewing gum. But... we definitely need to get married. Ho-Sang, I have something to talk to you about. Ho-Sang! Please open the door. Ho-Sang! Please open the door. Ho-Sang! Ho-Sang, please open the door. Ho-Sang... Have you seen Ho-Sang? No. He's not in his room? What's wrong? Has he disappeared? No, he must have just gone out somewhere. Aren't you eating? I don't see Dae-Bak. Where did he go? What's wrong? Huh? Tell me quickly, what's wrong? Because of you, Ho-Sang found out about everything. What? What I've done to him. My chasing after a rich man with a short life span, Ho-Sang found out about it. How... how did he find out? He heard you talking in the yard yesterday. He heard everything that I said? Oh no! What should we do now? What ticket would you like? Sir, please speak up. I'm very grateful that you're here. I thought you'd gone to a far away place. I was very worried. Ho-Sang. I... don't want to talk to you right now. I know... I know that you are very angry with me, - I understand but... - How can you have thoughts like that? Sorry. I had no idea... Do you know how grateful I was to you? A woman who told me she loved me, you were the first woman to tell me that. A woman who cared so much about me, who was so good to me. You were the only one. I'm sorry. The more I think about it, the more disgusting it is. You knew everything from the very beginning. I thought you would be devastated when you found out about my illness. Do you know how worried I was? Do you know how guilty I felt towards you? When you said that we were fated for each other, I wanted to believe those words, no... I believed them. If it wasn't destined from above, you wouldn't have liked a guy like me. You wouldn't have loved a guy like me that much. But everything... was only my illusion. Everything that I have treasured, was all an act fabricated by you. Don't think like that. It's true that I chased you around with bad intentions in the beginning, but somehow my feelings for you changed from what they were originally. It's not acting. They changed to genuine feelings. Probably because you thought I was pitiful. Since I have nothing and will be leaving this world very soon, you probably thought I was pathetic. You are saying this out of sympathy and guilt. That's why you want to help me, right? Just as Mother said, aren't you treating staying by my side as your punishment? No, it's not that. But I... in this world... I thought I knew you the best. The Na Ha-Na that no one else can see, I felt that I only, could see her through my eyes. But, now... Nothing has changed. The person that you see is me. My heart, is just like what you see, Ho-Sang. Ha-Na. Yeah? Just leave. With you near me now, I can only say words that will hurt you. So, please give me some time. I'm begging you. Ha-Na... Please come over here right now. Huh? Please hurry up before Ho-Sang goes anywhere. Where is Ho-Sang going by himself? What are you talking about? I'll explain it to you later. We can't leave Ho-Sang by himself. So please hurry up and come over. Nam-Kyung! Did Ha-Na call you? Yes. Sorry for surprising you. Can I ask you what's wrong? If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to. But please don't say you want to be alone. Because I'm a patient. At first, I was thinking of going to a far away place all alone. That's why I have come this far. But I can't leave, because I'm scared. I'm afraid of what will happen if I collapse in an unfamiliar place, somewhere nobody has heard of. What will happen if I never wake up? I'm scared of that. Ho-Sang. I told everybody else not to treat me like a patient, but I can't do it myself, escape from my own illness alone. That's normal. If you cut your finger, you would be worried about it the whole day. It's very normal for you to think like this. Nam-Kyung? Huh? Everybody says that, all is forgiven when death is near. But for me, up till this moment, I'm still full of frustration and regrets. That's why I can't let go easily. I don't know if I'm old-fashioned, or... I'm like this because it's not time for me to go yet. Still no news of Dae-Bak? I met him. You met him? Then why didn't he come with you? Where is he? Where is he right now? What do you want to do? I need to know where he's at in order to bring him back here. Don't call. Don't bother Ho-Sang. You are so unlike yourself. What are you talking about? He's sick. How can I just let him be like that? He should be alright since Nam-Kyung is with him. He's with Nam-Kyung? Wow, this feels good. Yup. Should I go back and stay in the car? If you want to be alone, I'll leave. You are acting like this because you think I'm pitiful too, right? Saying that you want to be by my side. Since you know that I'm sick, you're acting like this because I'm pitiful. Is it wrong of me to feel sorry for you? This is not the kind of sympathy where everything can be forgotten just by looking the other way. I can feel truly sorry for a particular person, because that person is very dear to my heart. Because I wish that person to be happy wholeheartedly. Let's... live our lives feeling sorry for each other and worrying about each other, comforting each other like this. Okay? Thank you. Take me with you. I can be quiet as a shadow and just follow behind you. I know that if I just let you go like this, I will be yelled at by Ha-Na for sure. Ha-Na contacted me so that I wouldn't let you be alone. Maybe... this is my very last chance to go on my own trip. Didn't you say that you were scared of leaving alone? I want to give it a try even if I'm scared... There are scary things waiting for me ahead... I shouldn't get scared so soon. I will call you often so that you don't worry about me. You have to call Ha-Na often too. I'll be leaving now. Don't get out. Lonely men don't like people to bid them farewell. Once you get there, you have to tell me where you are at. Okay. Have a nice trip. Where is Ho-Sang? On a trip. He left already. Sorry, I couldn't hold him back. What is there to be sorry for? You are only following Ho-Sang's wishes. I know that. Don't worry too much. He said he'll call when he gets there. Shall we... go for a drink? Huh? After all, we can only sulk and wait. Let's drink together while waiting. Cheers. Cheers. Cheer up! Okay. Ho-Sang told me, that the scary things will be waiting for him in the future, so he shouldn't be afraid so early on. We're in the same boat, too. We shouldn't get scared so early on. Let's not get worried and frustrated just because Ho-Sang's not with us right now. But you're not taking your hands off your cell phone even for a second. From the looks of it, he must have gone somewhere far away. He still hasn't called. The bathroom is outside. If you want breakfast, I can prepare it for you. There's no need. You aren't fishing? We rent out fishing gear, too. No, that's alright. Are you going through a break-up? Huh? Young men strolling all alone around the seaside. Most of them are going through the same thing as you. Yeah... I am going through a break-up. I can tell in a glance. There's nothing to be sad about, there are tons of women in this world. I'll cook you some soup for your hangover tomorrow morning. I can already tell you are going to drink a lot tonight. It's Ho-Sang! Hurry and answer it. It's me, did you get there safely? Yup, I just arrived. Where are you? Donghae*. (*Sea) Is he hurting anywhere? How are you feeling? Oh, I'm good. I'm with Ha-Na right now. I'll put her on the line. Here. There's no need. I've already found out that he got there safely. Ha-Na. Nam-Kyung, continue talking. Quickly, he's waiting. Oh, have a good rest. Make sure you have your cell phone next to you. I'll call you tomorrow morning. How does he sound? He doesn't sound like he's hiding his pain, does he? He doesn't sound like it. That's a relief. You're curious, right? Why Ho-Sang is mad at me. When I said we need to break-up, he didn't get angry at all. He's such a nice guy. You're curious as to how I made him get so mad, right? Yes, I'm curious. But I don't want to hear about it. Something that Ho-Sang didn't want to talk about, I think it's better that I don't know about it. Whatever the reason is for him to be mad at you, he'll come to understand your feelings in the end. Don't be too worried. How did you know my husband? That... he helped me before. I see. My husband always... whenever he saw people in need, he never pretended that he didn't see them. Yeah. You've come all the way to pay your respects, my husband will be very grateful. Have you eaten? We used to eat together, now I have to eat alone. I don't have any appetite. Granny, I'm very hungry. Can you give me some food? There aren't many side dishes. Try this pepper. I'm here. Oh, you came. The weather is hot, so I've brought some iced coffee. You must be very busy, yet you came here to give me this. Because of Dae-Bak, you must feel very bad. Where's unnie? Oh, she's inside. Drink up. I'm going to go in and see unnie for a moment. Go ahead. Unnie. Oh, you're here. The kimchi looks really spicy. Yes, it's very spicy. It's so spicy that I can feel the heat from my heart. Is Dae-Bak home? He went on a trip. By himself? Yeah. I have hurt him. Unnie, what did you do? The kimchi looks very tasty! I don't even know if he's eating decent meals. He has to be careful of what he eats now. Pass. Pass! Hey, Yoon Ho-Sang! Why do you ask for the ball when you can't even kick it properly? Ho-Sang, don't play soccer anymore! Geez... you can't even play soccer well? Boo... boo! What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. Why aren't you playing with your friends? I don't have any friends. I don't like that expression either. A long time ago, kids used to look at me with that expression. They thought I was a pathetic kid. Compared to people who tease me, or make fun of me... Those kids made me feel even worse. Why do you keep staring at me? Just because... you are very cute. Mister, you are a bad man, right? What? I was told to be aware of guys who tell me that I'm cute or buy me things. I'm not even cute. Mister, you are lying right now. No, you are very cute. I don't even hope that I'll be cute. Being pretty or lovable... I don't hope for those either. I will cherish you and I will love you. Oh, everyone's here! Thank you. What's going on? Why did you want our whole family to come over here? I've asked you to come over and help me. Are you asking us to help you sell coffee? Oh, that's not it. I want you to help me greet the customers. There are no customers, what's there to help with? There will be lots of customers coming, don't worry. Please volunteer at my coffee shop today. Madam Gong, do you not know what my family is currently going through? We are not in our right minds to help you sell coffee right now! But Dae-Bak is not even at home. Everybody is just sitting at home doing nothing. That is not going to change anything. Madam Gong! Gosh, you're going to help me anyways, so why are you all wound up? Ha-Na and Eun-Tak, you two will happily help me out, right? - Yes. - Yes. What? Mi-Ok, this isn't right. Everybody is in a bad mood. Oppa, you don't want to help me out? That's not it. Okay, I'll help you. But please don't bother the others. No! Hey... Mi-Ok! Eun-Tak, please hang this up outside for me. Okay. - 'Completely Free!' - Yeah. Aren't you doing business? How can you stay in business if everything is free? So only earning money is business? Earning other things can be business, too. [Gong Coffee Shop Is Treating Today! Completely Free!] Please take a seat inside. Two coffees and one ginger tea here. Four iced coffees. Welcome! Please come again! Hello! Iced coffee and ginger tea over there! Let's sit for a while before heading back. Everybody must be very busy right now though. It's alright. After all, it's all free. We can keep working after taking a break. Thank you for your help. It's nothing, seems like everybody is having a good time. I'm happy, too. Really. When I think life is very tiring and just need a break, I treat everybody to free coffee just like today. If I do this, the people drinking coffee thank me and smile at me. Then I feel great and full of energy. I'm very simple, huh? If Ho-Sang was here, he would have a lot of fun, too. I heard that he's on a trip, right? Yes. Dae-Bak must know quite a few things. Guys are charming when they take off by themselves. We girls have a weakness for men like that. It must be very hard, huh? I'm so stupid to ask this question. I'm fine. Compared to what Ho-Sang is going through, mine's nothing. Ha-Na, absolute tolerance and sacrifice, is not doing Dae-Bak any good. Just act the way you normally do. Go ahead and nag, get upset and express your anger. You two are in a relationship right now, you two are intensely in love with each other. It's so good to be in love with each other. Love is sizzling. I can guarantee, compared to the top one hundred treatments, being happily in love is the best medicine for Dae-Bak. But being in a relationship, it's not fun at all if only one person is always doing the compromising and taking the beating. You should fight with each other, break up and make up. That's what it's about. Don't take away that kind of pleasure away from Dae-Bak. Okay. But this is so great, to meet such a nice guy with a kind soul. There are a lot of people who can't find a similar person in their lifetime. Anyhow, love ends one way or the other. There is definitely heartache. If you want to love the right way, regardless of what is happening tomorrow, you need to love genuinely today. Since you two met during the best and most dazzling time of your life, both of you should love each other in a dazzling way, too. Don't you think so? Oh! Everyone has worked hard today! I'll treat everyone to dinner. You have already treated the customers to free drinks, so forget it. Just come to our house and eat. Gosh, then I'll feel bad. Honey, let's go back home first. We need to prepare the food quickly in order to feed all of them. Yeah, that's right. Ah, you are bringing your hubby with you. Let's go. Yeah. All of you come to our place, okay? Yes, hyung. Go back safely. Our Mi-Ok is the best! Why? At first you said you needed our help, and I was thinking what kind of deal this is. Now my brother and my sister-in-law are feeling much better. I was short staffed, that's why I asked. It's nothing. Things are almost done here, you two should go back. No, we need to help too. Let's go back first. Take your time heading back home, take your time... Yea... yeah. Dae-Bak hasn't called back yet? When he returns, I must teach him a lesson. - Eun-Tak... - Yeah? I... actually want Dae-Bak to be back sooner. But, on the other hand, I'm afraid. I don't know what he'll be thinking and feeling when he returns. What are you worried about? When he's by himself, he'll understand how important you are to him. If I was in Dae-Bak's shoes, I would have also gone on a trip alone. To a place where nobody knows me, to take some time and enjoy my life. After the trip, what if you still have some things you want to forget about? I would try my best to forget them, since I left to sort things out. Why are you looking at me like that? Dae-Bak is trying his best to sort things out, and come back a new person, isn't that good? I'm positive his sorting things out concerns you, because you are most important to him. Is he? Is he thinking like that right now? Yeah. What's your name? Ho-Sang, what kind of flower do you think you came in search for? I probably came to search for Ho-Sang. Please come in. You are living harmoniously with your dad in this room, right? Yes. Please have a seat here. Oh! Look at how well-mannered you are! We need to keep learning even as we get older. It's not just kids who need to learn from their parents, parents should learn from their children as well. So, what is that you want to talk about? A handsome young guy asking me to come over, telling me he has things to talk to me about, my heart is fluttering! Um... About my dad. Yeah? What about Pil-Goo? He likes you a lot. What? You... Me? Yes. Of course he likes me. I also like Pil-Goo. Do you like my dad? Of course! I already told you before. We have been friends for more than ten years. Are you going to just remain as friends forever? That... is to say are the two of you... going to get married? - Get married? - Yes. Both of you are very lonely, I think it would be great if you two got married. I think my dad is very worried about me, but I'm very supportive of you two getting married. If you get married to my dad, I will treat you like my mom. What do you think? Thank you! I really thank you for telling me that. Ah, what is there to thank? Although I am very thankful, but at the moment I... don't plan on getting married ever again. Eun-Tak, you don't know my nickname, do you? "Lover in Cheong Cheon"... that's my nickname. It wasn't given to me by somebody else; I made it up myself. I made up my mind to live my life like that. Actually... when I was young, I was married twice. I wasn't happy either time. But... I'm very happy now. I don't know what other people think, but I'm very satisfied with what I do. I like the people that I meet. I think my dad will be very disappointed. Pil-Goo knows about my feelings. However, I can promise you one thing, although I can't be Pil-Goo's wife, I can be his caring and loving girlfriend for life. Of course, if Pil-Goo finds the love of his life and gets married, then I'll just sell him coffee. Miss Lee... do you know how happy I am today? Is there anything to be happy about? Oh, I got a marriage proposal from Eun-Tak. - Huh? - Envious, right? Unnie... I won't stop you from dreaming that all the guys in this world like you. But you need to look at the guy of your fantasy. You already have Pil-Goo, how can you be this ungrateful? You are overreacting again. It's not like that. Eun-Tak asked me... asked me to be his mom. Huh? It was the most delightful proposal, amongst all the proposals I've received in my life. I will treasure it forever deep in my heart. What did you talk to Madam Gong about just now? Huh? Madam Gong came over here and said to me, something like "the son is a hundred times more handsome than his dad." Hearing that you are more handsome than me, are you happy? Are you jealous? Who's jealous?! A little bit. That lady... the more I look at her, the more generous she is. Even though she has a different aura, she has this resemblance to your mother. Looks like I've said something that I shouldn't have. Are you mad? No. I really like her too. Really? That's wonderful! - Dad... - Huh? I've always wondered in what kind of way I resembled you, but I must resemble you in this way. What way? You have the talent of spotting a good woman, but you don't have what it takes to steal a lady's heart. What? But I still have your mom with me, you are still not as good as I am. Yes, Dad is still a hundred times better than me. You will definitely meet a good woman, too. I knew that you?d be up here. Aren't you sleeping yet? Sitting out here every night, you're going to get a lot of mosquito bites. You only need to do good deeds for Dae-Bak, why are you being nice to the mosquitoes? Thank you. I missed Dae-Bak a lot today too, I think it's the same with the adults. Everybody gathered together to do something, but it was weird that Dae-Bak was not around. Although he wouldn't be much help even if he was around. That's right. He always goes around making trouble everyday. Even a guy like me feels this way. I worry about how you feel as well. Gosh, this is frustrating. Frustrating? Of course, it's frustrating. On one hand there's this girl who told me she doesn't like me, and on the other hand there's that guy who stole the girl I like from me. Why am I worrying about them like this? Both of them are really annoying. I also know that you are a very good guy. I'm not saying this to you just to hear those words from you. But, hearing it... doesn't feel so bad. Will Ho-Sang know? That you are worrying about him. That my whole family is worrying and waiting for him to return. I hope that he knows. That way... even if he doesn't want to see me, I hope that he comes back to this place. Are you eating your meals on time? How's your health? I've said something I shouldn't have said, and made you so sad. Whether I'm sitting or standing, I can't feel at ease. No matter how sad you are, you need to soothe your own heart. It's not good for your body if you stand in strong winds for too long. Come back soon, okay? Hey, kid! Are you going through puberty? Why are you wandering around by yourself? That kind of thing is suitable for me, not you! Stop showing off and come back soon. If you continue to make Ha-Na worried, I'm going to report you to the police. Okay? Ho-Sang, it's me. Sorry. Really, really sorry. Every single day, it's alright for you to say hurtful words to me. You can yell at me too. Please hurry up and come back soon. Please? Hello! Hey. Is there something wrong with your scooter? Yeah. This scooter hasn't been running well lately. - Let me try fixing it. - Alright. Oh! Looks like it really listens to you. This scooter is definitely a girl... a girl. Are you making a delivery? - Yup, free coffee. - Again? For a lonely old grandpa. He didn't come yesterday. He's not the type of person who would miss out on receiving a free coffee. I think he might not be feeling well, so I want to take a look. You really suit your nickname very well. Perfectly, huh? Nickname? Yes, I have something like that. It's a secret between the two of us. Take care and have a safe trip. I'll get going. See you later. - Take care. - Okay. Why didn't you come lately? Dad. What? I thought you had gone somewhere. You kid, are you teasing your father now? You are an interesting kid. How can you be so good at this game, too? Oh... from dad... I learned it from my dad in Seoul. Oh, is that so? Since you are smart, he must have had fun teaching you. Please teach me a lot too, Dad. What can I teach you? You can fish very well, right? I like fishing a lot too. But I'm not any good at it. You like to fish? I am quite good at fishing. Then wait till Dae-Bak returns, we'll all go fishing. Lets ask Madam Gong to come along, too. Yeah, lets do that. Mi-Ok can make excellent spicy fish soup. Yes. Mister! Mister! What? What's the matter? Unnie... Unnie got into an accident. What? Mi-Ok? Is she seriously hurt? Unnie... unnie. [Gong Cafe] [Chewing Gum] Gong Madam passed away, she would want to say goodbye to you, too. Um... Noona's funeral, can it be prepared by us? No. The road ahead for Mi-Ok, has to be taken care of by us. If it's done by us... it'll be done on a scale more befitting her. Madam Gong's funeral, we'll do it accordingly. We want to do something for noona also. Although we didn't know her for long, we liked her very much. I understand, then, you guys can assist in whatever way you can. Thank you, hyung. Noona left just like that. From now on, who's going to serve me ginger tea with an organic egg on top? Who's going to make it? Noona... I knew that you would come. I knew that you would definitely come. Madam Gong was so worried about me. I will always feel sorry for it. Why are you sorry? She left this world before me, I've never even thought of that. To live on and die later, it's so vain. Do you know where the word "live/save" originated from? When people say "save the fire, save" it means to keep the fire going. It means the candlelight of our life, will continue burning day by day. But everybody has a different length of time. A person's fire may be extinguished very soon, and for others, it may burn for a long time. It may go out today or maybe tomorrow. Only heaven knows. That's how Madam Gong left, it's very infuriating. It's very hard to grasp. Her life given from above has burnt out. That's why she's gone. Father, the candlelight of my life, knowing when it'll burn out... isn't a bad thing, is it? Come out when you're done. You must be shocked. It's shocking to find out that your mother died. And you had to find out about things you didn't know about. I... was afraid that my mom was living a lonely life. I was always worried about that. My mom made up those kinds of lies, so I wasn't worried about her. I only knew of it today, coming here. That I worried for nothing. Mom was showered with love from so many people. She would never have been lonely. Your mom, got as much as she deserved. There have always been a lot of loving people around. She was very good to everyone. I'm very grateful for all your help. To Mom, compared to me, who was so far away... everyone here must have been more like family to her. Of course, your mom took part in our family matters all the time. If she wasn't like family to us, she wouldn't have been able to do that. It's because we're all like family to each other. Alright, alright. We shouldn't cry anymore. Our Mi-Ok would be unhappy. Mi-Ok liked people smiling at her. Yes, she told me so. She said she was full of energy when people smiled at her. Yes, let's smile. It will give her strength. So we should smile. That day, I understood. People who strive to be loved will leave behind love after they pass on. People who strive to be happy will leave behind happiness when they pass on. If that's the case, what will I leave behind after I pass away? It doesn't feel real at all, Madam Gong passing away. Me too. Did you have a good trip? Yeah. The whole family was worried about you. I know. Now, it's still hard for you to forgive me, isn't it? Ho-Sang... I love you. It's okay even if you don't forgive me. But please don't doubt my feelings towards you. I love you now, and I'll continue to love only you from now on. Na Ha-Na's cheesy comments are starting again. I'm not going to fall for it anymore. Madam Gong had said, if you want to love the right way, no matter what will happen tomorrow, you need to love genuinely today. No matter how your heart may change, I think I should express my feelings for you. Saying I love you, I had no idea it would be so heartbreaking. If I knew it would be so heartbreaking, I wouldn't have said it so easily in the past. But at least you said those words. As of yet, I haven't said those words. I wanted to save it up and say them at the most perfect moment. But that perfect moment, may never come. I, want to go see my mom. I want to visit her while I'm still well enough. That's a very nice thought. I'll tell everybody. Okay. Oppa, you're here! But why are you do you have a sad face? Huh? Why are you here? I thought you'd be here. I look pathetic, right? No. I guess someone else will run the business here. I'm in turmoil inside. From now on, I don't know how I can pass by here. Dad... brighten up. If you go see your mom, it'll be heartbreaking. But I still need to go. Yes, you should go pay a visit. You're going to come back, right? Why are you asking these questions? If he feels comfortable and happy with his mom, he won't come back. I'll give you a call when I get there. Try to get as much pampering as you can by your mom's side. You spend some quality time there. Yes, I'll get going now. Go inside. I'll go now. Sir! Sir! Why didn't you get on? I'm sorry. Do you... want to come along? This is a free fansub. Get it @ D-Addicts and Soompi. Thank you for watching with us! Live on even if you are tired. Live on even if you are in pain. Live on even if you want to die. Don't feel sorry from far away. Don't feel sorry after you die. Live on with me and just love me a lot. If you want to love the right way, no matter what will happen tomorrow, you need to love genuinely today. No matter how your heart may change, I think I should express my feelings for you. I love you. I love you now, and I'll continue to only love you from now on.
