- Let's check this out. - You look lost, dear. - You the realtor? - Nope, next door neighbor. The realtor's name is Bradley. - Well I think I'm late to meet Brad and a cute little brunette. That's my wife. - Listen, I'm here. I'll call you back in 20. Hi, sweetie. - Hi. Swung in late. - This is Brad. - Hey Brad, I'm Dave. - Hi Dave, how are you? - All right, pleasure. - Excellent. Shall we? - Um, Brad. Who's that? - That's Mrs. Vega, lives next door. Kinda comes with the place but an no extra cost. She's an upside. - Hi, I'm Megan. - Hear we might be neighbors soon. - So, is there anything we need to know about this place? - No, come to think of it, the whole neighborhood's pretty uneventful. - Precisely the way we like it. Let's go. - So, what do you think, Dr. Geiger? - Well, I haven't been inside yet. Out here it looks kind of expensive. - Wait till you see the pool. - Pool, we can even afford a bird bath, seriously, Megan. My god. - Amazing, though. Come here. - What are you. This is in our price range? - Dave, are you kidding me? This? Come on. - What are we doing here? - Okay, just promise me that you won't ask any questions until you see the backyard. - Okay, well I'm not here to play around. - It's not gonna kill you, Dave. - All right, it's definitely beautiful. But you know, the one thing that makes my med school loans small is the size of your law school ones. Now I thought we were just gonna take our time. - Slow down, babe. We can afford it. - We can? How? - We're gonna rent out the guest house. - There's a guest house? - I thought that was Mrs. Vega's house. - No, no, she lives next door. That's all part of your property. - Wow, so we're buying two houses. - Well, why buy one house when you can buy two for the price of one and three quarters, right? - There's gotta be some kind of catch, Meg. - There's no catch. My salary plus the rental income will cover the mortgage until your done in residency. Then once you're making the big doctor bucks we'll kick out the tenant and put in a tiki bar. Of course that's code for saying we'll finish repaying our loans, but still. - All right, well I'm not gonna make that kind of money unless I make the fellowship program. - You're gonna get the fellowship program, I know you are. But don't think about the future for a sec. Think about the fact that we can afford this dream home right now. - It's a lot to think about. - Listen to me, sweetie. We need to stretch ourselves a bit here, otherwise we're never gonna get ahead. Now promise me you'll think seriously about this. - I will. As soon as I get back from work, okay? - Okay. Sorry Brad, it's my assistant. Hey Steph, I'm just finishing up here. I'll call you back in 45 seconds. - Thank you so much, we will let you know by 8 p.m. It was lovely to meet you, again. - Thank you, darling. Dear Paco, get well soon. - There's always a catch, Mrs. Vega. - Looks like it could be a bad break. You said you fell down the stairs? - Carrying groceries. - Okay. I'm just gonna need to go over a few more details before you see a doctor. - Would you mind waiting here? - Actually, I'd really like to stay with her if that's okay with you. - Sorry, it's policy. Won't take more than a few minutes. - Okay, I'll just be outside, sweetie. - You know Robin, when people fall, they tend to fracture their forearm near the wrist. Most mid-bone breaks result from a direct blow. - I hit the railing on a weird angle. - Robin, are you in a relationship where you feel hurt or threatened? - What do you mean? - Violence is common in many people's lives these days, so we now screen our patients for domestic abuse. Is it safe for you to go home Robin? - Of course it is. - Is everything okay, sweetie? - Hold on. Just a minute, Mr. Smith, please. - She's my wife and she needs me. Who are you to tell me I can't go in there? - Everything all right here? - Hi doc, this nurse is way outta line. - Doctor, I've asked this gentleman very nicely to wait in the lobby. - She's my wife and she wants me here. - It's not her decision to make. It's hospital policy. - To what, to keep me out when she needs me the most? - Listen, how about we take a walk? - Doc, you don't understand-- - I'm not gonna ask again. Let's go. - Hey. Get out, are you kidding me? - I know, can you believe it? - You bitch, I am so jealous. All this and you married a gorgeous doctor. Come here. You know, you're gonna have to pay for this. God's gotta even out the score. - Believe me, we're paying for it. - Yeah, you and what army? I thought you guys had crazy loans and that Dave was making pennies and that he couldn't afford. Wait. You have a pool. Screw you. I'm coming over every Sunday and I demand my own key. - And what's work? - I'm sort of between jobs. - I have my own website. That's all I'll say. - So you don't work at the hospital? - Do I work in the hospital? No. - Because we placed the listing on a hospital employee bulletin board. - Patients can read too, you know. - Does my psychiatrist work in the hospital? Yes. - I'm a consultant in town on a one-year managed care assignment. - Perfect. We'll run all the paperwork and give you a call tomorrow. - I'll look forward to it. - Thanks. - Hey, I'm looking for a Megan Mahoney. - Yeah, she's out back by the pool. You here about the apartment? - It's fantastic. - Did you get it? - Sorry. - Hey honey. I think I found our tenant. More when you get home. I love you. - Hope her name's Courtney Allison. - Hi. I didn't see you there. - I hope I'm not too late, I came straight from a double shift a the hospital and I can really use some good news. Have you rented it yet? - Well, my husband and I have to run a credit check and talk it over, so the short answer's no, but to be honest, I just made a verbal commitment so the long answer is sort of. - Really? Well can I at least fill out an application? - Yeah, of course. Here you go. - I have a pen, but do you think you could get me a glass of water? I feel really light headed for some reason. - Yeah, sure thing, I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Do you take ice, Courtney Allison? - Yes please, but just for the record, my first name's just Courtney, Allison's my last name. - Sorry. - No worries, it happens all the time. My full name is Courtney Walker Allison, so my last name's a first name, my middle name's a last name, and my first name's my grandma's middle name. I'm complicated that way. - Courtney! - My god, I am so sorry! I didn't notice. - It's okay, can you just help me? - You must hate me. - No, no, nobody hates anybody. Accidents happen, it's just that this one's still happening. - I'm sorry. I've been such a mess since my father died, I just. - They're all useless, aren't they? - Well the only legible ones are from stripper girl and purple hair. - Aren't they the same person? - No, stripper girl's a redhead. Purple hair plays drums in a wedding band. And what about consultant guy? - It's a complete bust. For the life of me, I can't remember his name. - Well maybe we give it a couple days and he'll call us first. - Well, to be honest, I'm not that worried about it. The one application that we do have is the person I like most - What are you gettin' at, babe? - Courtney Allison. - Are you nuts? The girl that threw all the applications in the pool? - It was windy out there today. - Okay, whatever you say. - Well listen Dave, you'd like her if you met her. She just moved to town from Phoenix, she's trying to get a fresh start, and do you know why? Because her fiance just died. And her dad died not long before that. She's got no friends or family in town, she's living out of a hotel, do I need to go on? - I don't know, Meg, I mean look around. She kind of failed the interview. - Look, she's got great credit, good references, she's an ER nurse at the hospital, by the way. And did I mention that she's super nice? - You sure about this girl? Okay. - Great. Okay. These are the last two. - I can't thank you enough for doing this on your day off, Dr. Geiger. - No problem. It was either help you carry boxes or help Meg organize her shoe rack. Just call me Dave. - Well, I didn't thank you for helping me the other week in the ER. That guy was a lot to handle on my second day. - Well I'm always happy to help. You looked like you were doing pretty good on your own. So where do you want these? - The bedroom's perfect. - Okay. - Thanks. Hey, you work on the sixth floor of the hospital right? - Yeah, um. Cardiac surgery. - I was thinking we should grab lunch sometime. - Yeah, you know, that might be difficult because I'm usually pretty busy. - That's too bad. Well, promise me you'll try. - Um. I will. - How's it going down there? - Place looks good. - Yeah? She's nice, right? Hello, ladies. - Hey there. How was work? - I'm exhausted. I think I'm gonna go up and take a nap before dinner. - That's perfect. I can easily squeeze a few more hours of this stuff in. - Due diligence report? - No, I'm finished with that. Right now I'm fact-checking a brief we're submitting to the district court on Friday. It's potentially very boring stuff. All right, well I'm gonna hit they hay. - Hey, how about a movie after dinner? - You know, we got a round early in the morning. Maybe tomorrow night? - I can go with you tonight, Megan, if you want. I mean, if it's okay with Dave. - Fine by me. - You know Dave, we're gonna have to get you in this hot tub sometime. - You will, just not today. - Meg, would you mind putting some lotion on my back? - Sure. This lotion? So, what do you think of Courtney? - She's fine. Pays her rent on time, she'll be fantastic. - Besides all that. - Is the part where I say she's ugly? - Well, we both know that she's not. - Well, I tell you, she is half the looker that you are, and hopefully she's less of a movie date. Or else I'd start to feel a little left out. If anyone around here should feel jealous. - Hey! - Hey. - You all set? - Yeah. Well, bye. - So how did you guys meet? - Um, Vegas baby. - No way! - I was at a bachelorette party, and he was there at a medical conference. I don't know why he sat down at the same Blackjack table as me and my girlfriends. And when I ran out of money, I got up to leave, and he asked permission to join me. - Sweet. - Yeah, I mean, it was a very anti-Vegas sort of pick up line. I mean most guys would tell you where to follow them, you know, to a bar or a hotel. But Dave asked very politely if he could follow me. I don't know, I knew right then he wasn't like other guys. - So where'd you guys go? - He took me to a show and for ice cream in Paris. The casino. - Okay. God, all right, it's official. I'm jealous. - Yeah, he has his moments. - Hey Dave, mind if I join you? What's going on? - Just catching up on a little research. I apologize now for my being a little tired. - That's okay. I'm not for conversation tonight anyways. My head's killing me. - Headache? - Migraines. I've had them off and on the past couple years. - There isn't a chance you could write me a Vicodin script, is there? - What about your primary care doctor? - Dr. Shaw writes them for me all the time, but he makes me come in for a check up which takes a week to schedules, so. Hey, you know, it's no big deal. I can totally ask someone else, it's just I feel bad for my patients. I've been pretty irritable the last few days. - Well, we can't have that, can we? All right, one time courtesy. Next headache, you see Dr. Shaw, and he'll write you refills as well. - Thanks, Dave. You're a star. - It's nights like this I wonder what I'm doing at the DA's office. You know, I should just work with for the man and buy myself a nice hot tub with a view. What did you do at work today? - I'm working with the domestic violence unit on the police force to develop a training manual for the DVU response squad. It's actually pretty interesting. - Yeah, you know what I did? I proofread a 95-page legal brief for typos. Believe me, Keira, the grass is always greener. - Okay, why don't we reinvest all this negative energy into something positive like, um, my social life. Are there any cute new doctors at the hospital that Dave isn't telling me about? - That's a good question. I haven't actually met all his new colleagues. - Hey, guys. Mind if I hop in the tub? - Hey, Courtney. No, go ahead. - Hey, I'm Courtney, the new tenant - Hi, I'm Keira, the law school friend. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - We weren't bothering you, were we? - No chance. I actually came to join in the discussion. All this talk about meeting Dave's doctor friends. They're pretty cute, by the way. I mean, not as cute as Dave, but cute. - You know Dave's colleagues? - Well, I wouldn't say I know them, but I met them in passing the other day when I was having lunch with Dave. Hey, you guys wanna join me? - No, we're just finishing up here. - Are you sure? You know, I have an open bottle of red in the kitchen, I'll go get it. Come on. - So are you dating anyone? - No, I'm trying to get over someone. - What about you, Keira? Anyone new? - I don't know yet. I gave my number to hottie last week at happy hour, but. - He's married, isn't he? - Why, is that bad? - For his wife, maybe. - Would you ever cheat on Dave? - What, no. Never. - Would he ever cheat on you? - Of course not. - How do you know? - Well, for one thing, he's too damn busy. I've known a lot of doctors who are busy cheating on their wives. I've been a nurse for six years. - Well, you've only known my husband for a month. - I've done the research, Megan. The American Family Council says that 60% of married men cheat. - Fine, 40 don't. - But, would you want him to tell you if he cheated on you? I'm sorry, Meg. I didn't mean to cross any lines. - I need a doctor. I lost my inhaler. I always have it in my gym bag. - Where's your wife? - She's parking the car. - Is she okay? Kate! I got an asthma exacerbation here. It looks like he's going downhill. He'll need some oxygen and nebs stat. Room six is open. - This way, sir. - Just looking for my husband. - Yeah, we're stabilizing his breathing as we speak. How's your arm? - Just great. - How about yourself? How are you? - Great, thanks. Can I see him? - Yeah sure, he's in op room six. Yeah hi, can I talk to Detective Barlow, please? - I'm not here to judge, Robin. I'm not here to arrest anyone. I'm only here to let you know your options. - It's not what it looks like. - What do you think it looks like? - Worse than it really is. - Hey Courtney. - Hey. - What's up? - Tough day. You busy? Do you and Dave argue much? - Um, why? - Sorry, don't answer that. It's just I've been thinking about this nightmare couple at work lately, just always fighting. - Well, Dave and I argue a little. It's been difficult with his schedule lately, but. It'll be better once he's done his residency. At least that's what we tell each other when we're done arguing. - I miss the fights. - What was your fiance's name? - I miss the fights, and I miss the good parts between the fights. - Sweetie, come here. - I miss him. - I know you do. You feel better? - Yeah, much better. Thanks. Just, sometimes I get so lonely, you know, Meg. - I know, it just takes time, Courtney. - Does Dave work tonight? - Um, wait, Courtney. - God. I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. - I don't know why I did that. I should leave. - Are you sure you're okay? - You remind me of myself before he died. I miss that. - Did you page me? I'll be right there. - Was that work? - Sort of. - Hey, Dave. It's like a sauna in here. I think the heater's broken. - That's odd, it's a brand new system. - Could you come and take a look for me? I think it's in the bedroom. Hoo! So, Dave. You ever dated a nurse? - I've been with Megan nine years. - And? - And before that I was in high school, so no I've never dated a nurse. - Assuming you've been faithful. - Which I have. - Good for you. - Good for Megan, too. So how about you, you ever date a doctor? - Three. Only one of them was married. - How'd that work for you? - Pretty great for him. - You know what, your night time set point's at 90, it should be down around 70. - Funny Dave, isn't it? Some of the easiest things are just right in front of you just there for the taking. - You know it's not funny. I gotta get to the hospital in four hours, and I'm tired. - If you're so tired, why don't you take a rest. - Megan likes you. She thinks of you as a friend. I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. - What did I say, doctor? - You try this again, and I'm kicking you out. - Your wife would never allow it. She considers me a friend, remember? Kiss Megan on the lips for me. - Dr. Walsh, you have a minute? - Got 30 seconds, what's up? - Real quick. Me and my wife wanna invite you and some of the team over to our new house for dinner. - Fantastic. Just run some dates by my secretary, take it a yes. - Hey Dave, quick question for ya. - Now's not a good time. - Yeah, I just need a quick Vicodin refill. - Give me a minute, okay? - That's cool, I'll wait. - I can explain. - Later. Your 30 seconds is up. - Dr. Geiger. You're due in surgery. Dr. Geiger. - Yeah, thanks. - Dr. Warner, wanted in radiology, please. Dr. Warner. - Is he in? Excuse me, Dr. Walsh? Could you spare another 30 seconds? - Have a seat. - I just wanted to apologize for earlier and give you a guarantee that it'll never happen again. And also that I'm more committed than ever to securing a place in your fellowship program. - Relax, Dave. We both know you're an excellent surgeon. - Thank you, sir. - But as you well know, Vicodin is a controlled substance, and somehow I doubt that the drug enforcement agency would be as quick to trust your judgment. Watch yourself. I'm not willing to risk the reputation of my entire program on one fellow. - Yes, sir. - Watch yourself, Dave. - Hey babe, got out early. I thought maybe we'd grab some dinner, drink, drinks, give me a call. Hello, Meg! - Hey Dave, pull up a chair. - Not now, Courtney. - Hey, did you get my messages? - No, I guess I left the phone in the house, sorry. - All true, Dave. I can totally vouch for her. - Okay you know what, I'm talkin' to my wife, all right? If I wanted to talk to you, I'd ask for a rent check or maybe a little more discretion at the hospital. - David. - Before you take her side, she almost cost me my career. - My god, I didn't realize-- - Drop it, Courtney. - If you need me, I'll be inside. - Okay, what's all this about your career? - Nothing, it's just she tried to get Vicodin off me again in front of Walsh. - Well he does he know she gets migraines? - It's poor form, Meg. But I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were gonna take her side. I don't wanna fight. I don't. You know, I just thought maybe it'd be nice, you know, maybe once in a while you'd take your cell phone out to the pool you know, on the odd chance that your husband calls while you're napping in the jacuzzi. - It's Saturday afternoon, Dave. I think I've earned myself a nap. - Yeah, a nap, bottle of wine, and some time well spent with your new best friend. - What do you think that we do out there? - I don't know, take turns reapplying suntan lotion? - That's cute. - Whatever it is, it's not doing the dishes. You know what I do, I come home late and tired and I find you sleepin' on the couch, I load the dishwasher, and I set my alarm for 6 a.m. - You bastard. I have been working my tail off all year long on stuff that you have no idea about. - I don't. - No, you don't, you know why? Because you never ask me about it. - Okay you know what, let's have a fresh start, okay? Tell me something really interesting about corporate law. - How dare you? Have you forgotten which one of us actually pays the bills around here? You know, I wouldn't be so quick to belittle my job, Dave, when the next time we're in a restaurant, I'm not paying for your dinner. - Is that what you and Courtney talk about all day? - Would you stop it? You know, you have no idea what I go through with that poor girl. You know what, at least we talk. - Yeah good. Yeah you know, seriously babe, have more wine. Let me get this straight, Dave. You're upset because I spend my free time with Courtney, meanwhile you're the one spending lunch dates with her in between your busy schedule. - Lunch dates? - Do you or do you not have lunch with her? - If you consider her sitting down at my table while I'm eating, then yeah, we've had a lunch date. - How come you never told me about it? - Are you serious? - Well, it's a little weird, don't you think? - What do you think we do at lunch? - You know, I have no idea. Because I've never been invited to the hospital. Maybe you take turns reapplying suntan lotion. - Just a sec. - Hi. I'm Detective Barlow. I got a call about a domestic incident. - In fact sir, you didn't. - Is your wife home, sir? - Um. - Hi, I'm Ben Barlow, ma'am. I'm with he Boston Domestic Violence Unit on the police force. - She's fine. - Is everything okay? - Hi. - What's this? - I'm sorry, did you say you got a phone call? - From who? - I'm sorry, I can't answer that. - Well, was it an older like pestery kind of lady, or was it a young, sexy kind of voice? - I really can't say. - Well, there's been some kind of mistake, officer. I just dropped my wine glass. - All right. I'll just write that up in my report. I'm sure you won't need this, I'm sorry to bother you folks. Have a good day. - Well, that was embarrassing. - Embarrassing and weird. - I wonder why she would call the cops. - I don't know, I don't think we can trust her. - We'd be crazy to renew her lease. - Wait, you think Courtney did it? - Of course. But maybe we should cut out the flying glass for next time. Give Mrs. Vega some peace of mind. - Sorry about tonight, sweetie. - Me, too. You sorry you threw a wine glass at my head? - You know I missed you on purpose. I just wanted to get your attention. - Not to encourage you, but it worked. - It did, didn't it? I love when I get your attention after a fight. - You better keep it down, you don't want me to get arrested. - Good morning. - Can't talk, running late. - I saw the police last night. - Gee Mrs. Vega, what a surprise. - Is everything okay, Megan? - Well it would be a lot better if you could stop nosing around our personal space. Or is that asking too much? I mean, don't you have a cat to feed or something? - Hey, speak of the devil. - Hi. - Hey, Courtney. - Hey. - What's going on? - Just single girl chats. But here, take my seat. I'm late for a shift. Bye, see ya. - Bye. - We need to talk, Meg. In other words, she blames herself for the rift in the relationship, like it's her fault that Dave is misreading her friendliness. - Courtney said that? - Word for word. Of course I don't believe her for a second, and I think you're crazy to let her anywhere near Dave, but hey, what do I know? I'm just a single girl. - She's had a rough year, Keira. She's just mistaking his friendliness. - Open your eyes, Meg. She drops by my office to discuss your failing marriage the day after she calls the cops on you. Something's up. - Courtney didn't call the cops. - Meg, hun, you can't honestly think that Mrs. Vega placed that call. - I hope you're here to apologize. - Mrs. Vega, I just need to know, did you call the police last night? - Why would I do that? - Please forgive my behavior this morning. It wasn't Mrs. Vega, Dave. - I didn't think it was. - Do I need to worry about you two? - Me and Courtney? Are you kidding me? Don't be nuts, baby. That is something that you never ever never have to worry about. Right, babe? - Okay, well she has to leave. - Okay, I know, we're not gonna renew her lease. - No, she's gotta go now, tonight. - Tonight? - She called the cops on us, Dave. - I have to work with this girl, Megan. - Did you know she went to Keira's office today and said that you've been flirting with her? - Babe, that's ridiculous. - Yeah, well she has to go now, or I do. - Okay well, you know, we might be duty-bound as landlords to fire a warning shot. - Are you coming? - Hey guys. Late night swim? - Actually Courtney, do you have a few minutes to talk? - Yeah, sure. - Dave? - Um, well. - Did you report us to the police last night? - That sounds more like Mrs. Vega. - It wasn't. - Well it wasn't me. - Courtney. - Guys, I'm sorry, but well with all the shouting and the tension up there. I grew up in a really violent household. Look, I know I had no right, I'm so sorry. - And did you have any right to lie to Keira this morning? - I didn't lie to Keira at all, I just told her how you were annoyed because David ogles me from the bedroom window all the time which you know you do, right Dave? - Okay look, we're not here to debate. We're asking you to leave, we're evicting you. - Excuse me? - Courtney, it's not working out. - Megan, you guys are all I have. We'd like you to leave by tomorrow. - Are you asking me or are you evicting me? - Both. - Because, I mean, you have every right to ask me to leave and of course I have every right to say no. I mean, you don't really have any legal grounds to evict me with. So I mean, I could ask you again, are you asking me to leave or are you evicting me because, I mean, the answer doesn't matter either way because I'm not leaving. - So, what do we need to do, drag you through the courts? - You could try, Dave, but honestly, I pay my rent, I obey the lease. I can't see as you'd gain any ground. - This is our house, this is our property. - Yeah but this is our lease, which means for the next 10 months, this is our pool. Sorry guys, but the law's on my side here. Stronger than your little precious wedding vows, so until June or death do us part. - Here we go. Neither party can terminate a fixed term lease without cause. Okay, so basically we need to show that she breached some material term of the agreement. How do we do that? - I assume she pays rent. - Yes. - Has she broken any terms of the agreement that you can think of? - She called the cops on us. - And they found a broken wine glass, anything else? - No. - Any unauthorized subletting, pets, drug-dealing, prostitution? Meg? - What are we gonna do? - Not now, I'm due in surgery. - Dave, we need to talk. - Later. - You can't just kick me out, Dave. - We're certainly gonna try. - Wow. Your asthma's really out of control, isn't it? You must be suffocating. Your poor wife. She feels trapped in this marriage. Helpless, suffocating. It doesn't have to be like that. You feel that? That's what your wife feels every minute she's with you. Trapped, suffocating. She shouldn't have to feel that way, should she? No. Right. She shouldn't. - Hi there. - Mrs. Vega, hi. - Anything exciting? - Nothing for me, just a bunch of stuff for Megan and Dave. How you been? - Same old, same old. - Okay well, have a good day. - Hi, you've reached Meg Mahoney and Dave Geiger. Sorry we're unavailable to take your call right now, but you know the routine. - Hello, this is Dr. Walsh's secretary. He's asked for me to confirm dinner this Tuesday evening. - Yeah, hi. Hi, this is Megan Mahoney. Sorry, I just came in from a run, so you said Dr. Walsh can make it on Tuesday? - Yes, does that work? - Absolutely, yeah, I'll tell Dave. - Also, Dr. Walsh's nephew will be in town with his wife. - By all means, you know what, bring 'em all, that's great. - Perfect. - Okay well, thanks for your help. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello? Courtney? My god, Mrs. Vega. - Is everything all right, dear? - This is ridiculous. I can't live like this anymore. - Ready? Okay, whoa! - Um, Courtney, hi. Excuse me. - Hey, Meg. This is Nikita, he's the EKG technician at the hospital. Nikita, this is Megan. She's the landlord I was telling you about. - Hi. - Now, I hope you're not kickin' us out. - Listen Courtney, Dave and I are having some people over for dinner tonight, and we're planning on serving cocktails by the pool. - Damn, you shoulda told me. We're having people over tonight, too. But you guys are totally welcome to join us poolside. - No, Courtney, I'm asking you to leave the pool area. - Unless the laws change, Meg, this is exactly where we'll be. - Okay listen, Courtney, this is really important that we make a good impression tonight, so I'm asking nice. Can you try and show a little bit of respect. - Pleasure to finally meet you, Megan. I've heard all good things. - Likewise, doctor. - It was so kind of you to allow us to bring these two. My nephew so seldom makes it to town. - We're up for a medical conference, at the Warber. Thank you so much for having us. - It's a pleasure, welcome. - Did Dr. Walsh tell you they were coming? - No, he didn't say a word, it's so bizarre. - Okay look, I can make the food stretch out, but I'm short two place settings. - We'll make it work. - A toast. First, I'd like to thank Megan and David for bringing us together outside the hospital. We work too hard, too close, and too long not to socialize more often. If I may, I'd like to share some thoughts about Dave about the amazing young doctor, David Geiger. The first. When I first met Dave. I'm sorry, this isn't exactly-- - Maybe we should call the cops. - Um yeah, long story. - What can I say, the man throws a great party. To be continued. - I assure you, it's never been this loud before. - Well feel free to rise in discussions or if you so choose to disrobe. - Thanks. - Bye bye. - David. Megan, fantastic evening. - Thanks for coming, doctor. I hope to someday hear the second half of that toast. - Perhaps on a night when your Vicodin nurse isn't throwing a pool party. - You mean Courtney. She's just-- - Our tenant. And I assure you I've stayed within the lines since was last discussed it. - Thanks, wonderful dinner. - Not bad for our first dinner party. - We gotta get her outta here, she's destroying our lives. - Relax, sweetie. She isn't destroying anything yet. - Come on, that's the thing. I think she already has. I think Walsh was gonna give me my acceptance tonight, and he pulled back. - Come on, you don't know that that's true. - No? Bev's already in. Walsh told her yesterday. Come on, the writing's on the wall, Meg. She's ruining my life. - Our lives. - My career. - You know, we're in this together, Dave. We share in each other's successes and failures. If Courtney destroys your career, then she destroys both of us, and I'm not gonna let that happen. - Fine, we might win the war. But face it, tonight she won the battle. - Don't let her destroy us, Dave. - Well no, we had half of it. - Hi, this is Keira Green calling from the District Attorney's office about one of your employees. She's a nurse, her name is Courtney Allison. I need a name and contact information for someone at her previous employer. Sure thing. St. Jude's Hospital, Phoenix. Perfect, thank you very much. Hi, this is Keira Green from the Olympia District Attorney's office. I'm calling for a verification on one of your former employees. She's a nurse, Courtney Allison. Really, are you sure? Her full name is Courtney Walker Allison, I'm quite sure she worked there, I just got off the phone with her present. No, it's Courtney Walker Allison. So you have an Allison Courtney Walker, but no Courtney Walker Allison? That's odd. Thanks. We need to talk, Meg. It's about Courtney. She is damaged goods. She also lied about her name on the lease. That's legal grounds for eviction. Call me as soon as possible. - All messages deleted. - It's your wife, Dr. Geiger. - Good night, Dave. Hey, I got an early meeting. Good luck with that. - Do you wanna eat breakfast? I absolutely do, but I'm exhausted. Anything important? - No, no reason. Just to talk. Breakfast tomorrow sounds lovely. Have a nice meeting. - Her real name is Allison Walker. She lied about it on the lease, grounds to invalidate. - Wow, that's great. It's creepy, though. - Creepy, Meg? What if I told you her dad died 20 years ago? - She told me he died last year. - I know. Get this, he was a doctor. Courtney's mother actually murdered him when she caught him cheating with a nurse. She went to jail, and Courtney ended up in a series of foster homes. - My god. - I know. Makes you feel all dirty, right? - No, I feel sad, that's horrible. - Spare me. Look, I have a lunch at the courthouse. I'll pick up the summons then, and then she'll have three days to vacate after I serve her. - Okay. Wait, can you prove all this? - Sure. I mean, it would be nice to actually have something that said Allison Walker. - Shouldn't or don't? - Don't worry Meg, you'll be just fine. She's a nut, that one. The real thing. - Back so soon. That's nice. I'm sorry for being rude earlier. I don't deserve this at all. - Yes you do, Dave. Who's, Courtney? - Relax. - Get off of me! - Dave, it's me. What are you doing? - Like you haven't even thought about it, admit it, Dave. Stop it. How did you get into my house? - Don't worry about that, Dave. Shh. I think you want it now, don't you, Dave? - I don't. - Please. I wanna take care of you. - You're insane. - Your secret's safe with me. - I need to get that. - You gonna behave yourself if I let you out? - Of course I am. How did you get in my house, you crazy bitch? - You left the back door open. - Don't lie to me. - I won't if you don't. - This isn't a game, Courtney. - So tell me this, Dave. Is it a game when you stand there and ogle me from the bedroom window? - What just happened didn't happen, okay? And it's never gonna happen again, understand? - If you say so. - Get out of my house. This is Dr. Geiger returning a page. - Hello, Courtney? Anybody home? Courtney? You go girl. What the hell? My god, David Geiger, you bastard! - See anything you like, Keira? You're so obvious. - The party's over, Allison. This is a three-day eviction notice. You know, giving a fake name on a lease is breach of contract. Sleeping with your friend's husband is much worse. You disgust me. Nice. Try not to stab me in the back on my way out. - Not so fast. - What, are you nuts? Think about what you're doing, Courtney. - I planned the whole thing. - Yo-hoo! Hi there, Courtney! Need anything from the store? - No, thanks Mrs. Vega, I'm fine. - You haven't seen Megan, have you? I'm curious if she needs anything. - No, I haven't seen her today. Well, Mrs. Vega wait. Do you have a sec? - Don't I always? Well, it's just I got this leak in my bathroom, and I just can't seem to figure it out. I'm kinda hoping you can help me. - It'd be a delight. - Hello? Dave? Who do you think you are? - It's not what it looks like, Meg. I can explain. You have every right to be angry and jealous, even. Jealous enough to kill Dave. - Hey, I got an urgent page from Dr. Walsh, but I haven't been able to reach him yet. - Walsh, I think he's in room 28. - Surprise! - Welcome aboard, David. For what it's worth, it is my great honor to welcome you into the program. - No, no, no, it's my honor. Thank you, I had no idea. - It's no use fighting. I use those to restrain PCP freak outs. I don't know why you're so surprised, Megan. Doctors are all the same. My dad was a doctor. He was a lot like Dave. Know what he did? He cheated on my mom with a hospital nurse. So she killed them both. Or so the story goes. The truth is, Meg. My mother couldn't hurt a fly. But somebody had to kill them, right Megan? I mean, they destroyed our family. Dave's gonna die tonight, Megan. Here's the thing. When the cops find my sex tape and my panties under your bed, and when they read about your history of domestic violence, they'll have no choice but to assume it was a crime of passion. Jealous rage. Most murder-suicides are. You're gonna take the blame for me. Just like my mom did. Only difference is, you'll be dead. Hello? Yeah, I need to report a domestic disturbance. One two four Clinton Street. My neighbors are fighting, and it's just getting really violent in there, and I'm to afraid to go out. One two four Clinton Street. Just please, just hurry. - 124 Clinton Street, shot fired, I need back up. - Megan! Meg! - Courtney! - Be careful, Ben. He's got a gun. - I got at least one wounded, I'm gonna need an ambulance now. - Meg! - Sorry. - Megan! She's got a gun. - Where's Keira? My god. - We gotta get out of here. - My god, Dave! What's this for? - Shoot first. - Do I have your attention now, Dave? - What do you want, Courtney? - You. This is just your kind of ending, men. The woman has the upper hand. - Don't do it, all right? - This is Barlow, we're down at the guest house. It's all clear. - Be at the hospital in less than 10 minutes, he'll be fine. You're gonna be okay, detective. - Are you sure about that? - Absolutely, you need it more than I do. I'll see you at the hospital. And make sure that second ambulance gets here right away? Listen babe, I can explain about those pictures. - I know you can. Not now. Are you okay? - Not without you. - Me too.
