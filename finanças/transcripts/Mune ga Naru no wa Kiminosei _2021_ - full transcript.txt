Almost there. Excuse me. Safe. [ Disciplinary ] Your class and your name. Umm, but... Your class and name. Second year... Arima? Hey! Teacher, we still have plenty of time. Look. It's 8:29 a.m.. He's right. Mine's advanced. Hey! But a messy life is a messy mind and students with a mind like that won't become beautiful boys and girls! That's lame, Tsukasa. You shouldn't get caught like that. Shut up! You always take me by surprise. [ Hayato Arima ] [ 1st Year High School - Third Semester ] I'm Hayato Arima. Your seat in class is next to her. Take care of him, Shinohara. I will. He's handsome, but isn't he scary? I'm Shinohara. You can ask me anything. I'm just breaking the ice. - Thank you, Teacher. - Okay, take the balls to the equipment room. [ 2nd Year High School - 1st Semester ] Tsukasa, you got a minute? - Yes! - Yes! Not you, Shinohara. I'm sorry. It's not funny. It's funny, isn't it, having the same name as a man. It's a nice name, "Tsukasa". What? I think it suits you. You come at me with unexpected timing, grabbing my heart. Tsukasa, if you keep at it, you'll be late. Don't run in the hallway! All right. Let's go. Hurry. [ 2nd Year High School - 2nd Semester ] Go for it! Go for it! - Good morning. - Morning! [ 2nd Year High School - 3rd Semester ] Before I knew it, I found myself looking at you all the time. [ Bye-bye 2-B! ] Hurry! Hurry! Second year is almost over. I wonder if we'll be separated in different classes in third year. Why don't we all go somewhere during spring break? - Great idea! - Where? Where? I was thinking maybe Fuji-Q Highlands. Oh, that looks like fun. H-Hey! What? Can I borrow some pencil lead? It's okay, but you have to return it. Okay. You said that, but you forgot about it before. Okay, fine. Then next time I'll pay you back with my body. Idiot! No! He's really stupid, isn't he? You're like a comedy duo. No, no, stop with the hard-to-make jokes, please. You're just happy he's bothering you again. That's not true. I bet Arima likes Tsukasa. Because he always get Tsukasa involved. Like that earlier. He would never act like that to us both, right? You should confess to him as soon as possible. No, no, what are you talking about? If you're not careful, someone else will get him. Don't worry. It's definitely mutual. We guarantee it. - Go for it. - It's gonna be okay. What? No... And so, ever since first year, I've been in love with you. I'm sorry. Huh? I'm sorry! I... I don't see you in that way. How can I say it, Tsukasa. I think of you as a really great friend. Ah, yeah! Okay. I know, right? Yeah. Then, let's stay as friends moving forward. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. If only I didn't think anything of it. Please don't confuse me! [ It's Your Fault That My Heart Beats ] [ English Subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] - Yeah. You see it? - There it is! We're still together. Thank goodness! [ Hayato Arima ] There he is. Looks like we're in the same class. Nice to meet you. What? Yay, we have a hot guy in our class. Lucky us! He's really handsome. [ Shinohara confessed to Arima and got rejected! ] What is this? I don't know who wrote this, but I heard it from Arima too. Arima did? That guy's a jerk for telling everyone about it. No... No, Arima wouldn't do that. Arima's here. What happened? Who wrote that? You bastard! Hey, stop it! - Arima! - Stop it! Guys, let's break it up. Wait. What the heck are you doing? Arima, stop it! That's enough from you! [ Suspension ] [ 3 - A Hayato Arima ] - Good morning! - Morning! [ Suspension ] [ 3 - A Hayato Arima ] [ Suspended for 5 days ] Arima! Arima! Hayato Arima! You're too loud. I... I really do love you, Arima. Thank you for being there for me yesterday. Listen, I'm not giving up on you yet. Even if you reject me, I'll do my best! Well, then. That's all for now. OUCH! Please excuse me. Tsukasa! I look forward to another year. Yes! Yes! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! What's up with you? Arima! Yes? Please read this. Okay. - Thanks. - Did you just see that? Isn't that a love letter? Yeah. Arima suddenly became popular in third year, huh? Yeah. You failed to get him, right? Don't say that! It's about time. See you later. I definitely like Hasebe. - Sorry. - Sorry. I'm sorry about the other day. The truth is, I heard what you girls were talking at the end of second year. I've... always been in love with you, Shinohara. That's why, I... It's okay. Don't worry about it. But I wanted you to know how I feel-- She really hates persistent men. Tsukasa, you're quite popular. Why not just move on to Yasuda this time? It has nothing to do with you, Hasebe. I guess it's really over, huh? You know, at my cousin's school, Mayu was Arima's girlfriend. What? She still has feelings for Arima. She asked me to check up on him. It's such a hassle, this kind of thing. Arima had an ex-girlfriend. Okay, okay. In our upcoming orientation camp, any recommendations in our class to run it? Are you going to do it, Tsukasa? You're good at it. Am I? - Here! - Okay, you there. I recommend Mikami. She can do it, right? I... - Please do it! - Please! But... Hey, hey, don't force it on her. Any others? Anyone? Anyone else? Here! I'll do it. Shinohara, I'm counting on you. Yes. Okay, it's decided. Round of applause! You're good at it. It just happened. Just happened. Idiot! Shut up. We're here! [ Kitami University High School ] Thank you for your help. The kitchen is over there. Kitchen's over there. - She's cute! - She's cute. She's really cute. She's so cute! Cute! Don't stop. Move, move! Fuzoku High School is also camping here. Move! You've got a leaf on you, Hayato. What? You haven't changed. Thank you. - Let's eat! - Let's eat! Now put it in. Huh? Looks delicious. - I'm so hungry. - Is it still not done? - It's almost done. - How many seconds until do-- Hayato! Would you like to eat this? What? We made too much. You too, guys. - Are you sure? - Seriously? Here! WOW! Looks delish! Don't mind if I do! See you. - Delicious! - It's really delicious! Sorry for the wait! It's so heavy. Why are you doing all the cleaning yourself? Hey! Your curry. It was okay. Huh? You ate it? But the carrots were too big. What are you going to do with that? It's okay. It will dry soon. I'll hold it for you. Now go wash. But if you do this, it'll be weird-- - Just do it! Here, it's done. Thanks, you helped me out. You're still as lame as ever. You should tell those guys at the committee that you are not a handyman. But... You really are a softie. Hey! Tell me. Why... Why did you reject me, Arima? You're asking me that here? Yes. No, no, because we didn't have that kind of atmosphere at all. Even when we're together, I feel as if I'm with my guy friends. In other words, you're 100% not interested in me. I mean, why wouldn't I be? No, no, no. There are many great things about you, Tsukasa. Like what? First, you're a bit crude. Also, you're someone that needs to be looked at a lot. I'm worried about you laughing near me even in public. Are you trying to fight me? And... that you believe in me. Hayato! What is it? Hello! Hello. Hayato, do you have a moment? Ah! Tsukasa, you're here! I'm sorry we made you do that. It's okay. It's okay. I'm used to it. What's wrong? Nothing. Let's go. Here. I'm sorry. Hey! That girl hasn't eaten yet. What? Seriously? We still have some left. - Sorry. Come on, let's eat. - Sorry. Thank you. I'll deal with the leftovers. Huh? You two seem close. Are you okay being out here on your own? It's 10 o'clock now. How's your body? I'm okay! I'm getting used to my new school. I see. That's good. Yeah. We meet at last. I... I came back here to meet you, Hayato. You've worked hard. Please don't walk out without permission. My cousin was in the parking lot earlier. Her name is Mayu Hasebe, a she's a third year at an all-girls school. I wasn't asking, though. Tsukasa, it's written all over your face. You get worked up easily, and it's easy to understand. So what? You're not used to being in love, it's so obvious. Midori, did you bring all these manga with you? - Yeah. - It must be heavy. Hey, lights out in half an hour. - What!? - I'm not sleepy at all! Hey, how about we sneak into the men's room right now? What? Good idea. Sounds interesting. No, no. That's a bit bold, don't you think? It's okay. We're making memories of our high school life. I'm on the committee after all. If we're going, I want to go to the hottie Arima's room. You wanna go, don't you, Tsukasa? I'm on the committee. - Whoa! Seriously? - Shh! We're coming in. Oh, so you came. No... I'm just gonna watch to make sure nothing goes wrong. What are you doing out there? No... I am just chaperoning. As a member of the committee? Yup! As a member of the committee. Let's play a game. You brought that? Must be heavy. - Three! - Three! One, two, three. You went to the beach and came across an oarfish. The reward is around 20 million yen! On Sunday, let's go to the beach together. What beach? I'm gonna catch ya! A messy life is a messy mind! This is bad. This is really bad. This is the worst! Hurry up and hide everything! - The lights! - Lights? - Hide here. - What? Arima. You can hide in here! I'm coming in! What? Is everyone in this room? Yes. - Damn. - That was close. That was too much. Do you even know who that guy is? What? Ta-Taguchi, right? Or is it Tanoguchi? Geez... Don't try to get into the same bed with a guy whose name you don't even know. But Arima... What? Yes. Kitami University, over here. Okay, let's gather here! Clear a path here! Quickly! Over here! Okay, over here. Everyone, quickly! Me? Everyone, quickly! You're Tsukasa, right? Yes. You have something to ask her. What? I want to go to the beach with all of you on Sunday. Just make it look like you invited me. You can't, right? But... We just met, and I'm sorry for asking you something like this. But... I want you to help me. I heard it from Yasuhiro. That Tsukasa is Hayato's closest friend. - If you don't want to, say no. - I... I want to go out with Hayato again. Please! Will you help me? [ Mayu is coming to the beach too! ] [ It'll be fun! ] [ Are you going? ] [ I'm going! ] BEACH! It feels good! Such a nice weather! - I'm the nice weather guy after all. - Indeed you are, Hasebe. I'm glad the weather is good. Why did you invite those two? It just kind of happened. You're always like that. Hey, Hayato. Let's go over there. Mayu, don't run just like that. I'm okay! Slow down! Hurry! Hurry! What the hell is she doing? Hey, hey, hey! Let's go buy some drinks. - Let's go! - Let's go, let's go. Tsukasa, you are a challenger. I can't believe you knew she was gonna show off. You too. You often do this because she's your cousin, right? Because Mayu desperately asked me to. That girl has always regretted breaking up with Arima. On the day Arima decided to transfer to another school, she said "I'd rather break up with you than go through the pain of being apart from you." She's stupid, isn't she? They didn't have a falling out or anything. Well, after that, she got sick, her parents divorced, and a lot of things happened. She's been through a lot, too. You worry about your cousin, I'm impressed. I'm more impressed with you. You're single-mindedly thinking about Arima like that. No, especially since I've been rejected. But you still love him, right? Even if he rejects me, I've decided that I won't give up on him. What? In that case, I might as well enjoy it. Since we've come to the beach. Here, pass! Nice catch! - Come on, hurry! - Tsukasa. - Over here! - Hasebe! Go! Slowly! Where is it? - Straight ahead! - Like that! - Like that! - Like that! No, to your left! - Your left. - More to your left! Hasebe, hold it! - That's good! - That's it! Ready! That's okay, Hasebe! I've sent it. I got it! Thanks. We should go to the restaurant on the highway now. We'll be there in a bit. Okay. Don't let her beat you. Wait up! - Here. - Thanks. Mama! Mama! What's wrong? Where's your mom? I don't know. You don't know? Okay, let's find your mom. Okay? I'm gonna lift you up. Let's go. - Ready? - Wow! Where? Where? - Is she here? - Ko-chan! Big sis! - Is that your big sis? - Yeah! Big sis! Wanna come with us? Yes, come. Where's your mom? Ah, are you the mom? It lacks air. What's wrong, Mayu? Is she okay? You're a little tired, aren't you? I'll be fine if I rest. I'm gonna go buy ice cream for everyone. Tsukasa! You forgot this. - You need your wallet for that. - Ah, sorry. I'm coming with you. Okay. Is it okay leaving those two alone? I don't mind. Because... Hayato will always come back to me. Wow. So confident. Mayu's cute, isn't she? What? Well... She's so feminine-like, even I, a woman can't stop looking at her. I'm glad you were there. What do you mean? Welcome. Cup of ice cream, please. - Do you want the special ice cream? - Yes. Sorry for the wait! Mayu, what's wrong? Are you okay? There's a rest area over there. Let's go? Maybe you should lie down. I'm okay. Are you okay, Mayu? Arima? I'm gonna take her to the rest area. - I need you to get her stuff. - I'll call Mayu's family. Yes, please. Are you okay? It's just anemia. I have my medicine. Rest here for a while. I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. - I'm gonna go buy some water. Okay. I'm sorry. We were having so much fun. Don't worry about it. - You're really kind, Tsukasa. - No, I don't think so. Thanks to you and Yasuhiro, I can go out with Hayato again. You see, I went abroad with my father on business. But... while I was over there, all I could think about was Japan. I love Hayato so much that it broke me. I think I can do better this time. Will you continue to help me? I'll take her home. Mayu's father told me to call him when you get to the station. Okay. I'm sorry, Tsukasa. It's okay. Be careful, okay? I'll tell Midori and the others. If you want to cry, go ahead. I'm not gonna cry. It's fine. I don't see anything. What a strange way of caring. I'm a gentleman at heart. I know it's a one-sided love, so I'm trying my best to be a friend. It's still hard. Unrequited love is uncool and painful. So why don't you just stop? And it would probably be even harder... What? Even if I stop this one-sided love, I can't stop loving him. I've never had unrequited love, so I can't relate to that. Hasebe, you're really annoying sometimes, you know? Thank you for coming all the way out here for me. I'm sorry. It's okay. I forgot to take my medicine. You don't have to take it. You weren't really sick, right? I'm not lying. I'm really... I can tell that you are faking it. I've seen it so many times before. If so, then why did you take me home? I wanted to talk to you. Talk? I don't want to hear that. The... most fun I've ever had in my life was when I was with you. We can go back to that time again, right? - Mayu-- - We... can start over, right? I'm sorry. That day you got injured, I've regretted it since I got transferred. If it's not soon, then I'll do anything now. But... I don't feel that way anymore. So... don't expect me to go out with you like I did back then. I figured you'd be alone anyway, so I came. Meddling as always. Uncle changed women again? He always does. Good morning. - Good morning! - Hey, what are you doing? - That was cold. - I have no reason to be nice. We're dating, aren't we? We're not dating! - Wait a minute, Tsuka-- - Hasebe. - Good morning, thanks for yesterday. - You're too pushy with Tsukasa. She didn't like that, you know? Because Tsukasa is so interesting. If you just want to play, I'm telling you to find someone else. And why are you telling me this? If my friend gets involved with a creep, of course I would stop him. So if I get serious about Tsukasa, will you stop me, Arima? Arima, you rejected Tsukasa before, didn't you? And yet you call yourself a friend, you have no right to interfere like this, do you? That's not fair. Hurry, the movie's about to start! Tsukasa! I'm sorry about yesterday. Is Mayu okay? Yes. I see. That's good. Wanna get ice cream where we got it yesterday? Thanks to you and Yasuhiro, I can go out with Hayato again. Sorry! I have plans today. I see. Arima, I know you have a strong sense of responsibility, but if you're following up on me I'm totally fine. What the heck!? I know exactly what I'm doing. Bye. Here. Apologies for yesterday. You didn't have to do that. Now we're even. What? Be honest with me. Tsukasa. You're lying about being his friend, aren't you? Ever since the camp, you've had your eyes only on Hayato. You look like a fool, always unrequited. I... I was Hayato's girlfriend, so it wasn't like we weren't close or anything. Hayato and I have a special connection. I know that already. I'm fine with it being unrequited. I just want to be in love with Arima as long as he lets me. I've been in pain ever since I was rejected, and I wished I never confessed. I've tried giving up so many times, but I just can't. My love for Arima is not a matter of the heart. It's... already a part of my body. What the hell? I'm such an idiot. Yesterday, I... I was completely rejected by Hayato. He said he won't go out with me like he did before. He told me clearly. What does that mean, Arima? Shinohara! Tsukasa Shinohara. Is Shinohara absent? She didn't call, though. - Not here. - I don't know, sir. I MADE IT! You didn't make it in time. You're out. No way. Come to the staff room later. [ A messy life is a messy mind! ] Please excuse me. Thank you for coming fashionably late. Hey. What? You've got leaves sprouting in your hair. What? No way. I was trying to make a shortcut to the courtyard. You're stupid to no end. Not there, don't move. I'll do it. - That's enough. - There's still some more. It's okay, really. Steal! Isn't that nice, Arima, that you're so single-minded about her. What is it? I thought it was interesting to see Tsukasa fidgeting like a little animal because she likes you. But when you think about it, the girl wasn't the little animal. What are you trying to say? Who knows. I don't even know myself. The other day, Tsukasa asked me about you and your past. I don't know how much did I tell her. Just so you know. Tsukasa is not the kind of person who would pry into other people's pasts. That was cool... I... wasn't aware that I was being a coward, so after you told me, I thought a lot about it, and for that I'm grateful. - See you tomorrow. - Bye-bye. Where are we going? Yeah, yeah, heart! Did you set it? Yasuhiro, what are you spacing out here for? You've been acting really strange lately. Listen. This is just hypothetical. When you can't stop thinking about someone's face and you can't stand the thought of them thinking about someone else, what do you think it is? - Huh? - Huh? "What do you think that is?". That's obviously love! Love!? What? Did you watch some love story drama? Maybe. What the hell is that? - One more time. - What? Again? You've done it now, huh? So uncool and annoying. I didn't want to know. Renaissance period and impressions. Almost there. I've got it. Tsukasa? Huh? Ow! Tsukasa! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I fell on my butt! Ow, ow, ow... Arima? I'm sorry. That I called you out. What are you talking about? It's not your fault. I fell down on my own. Arima. I'm not that fragile. I am twice as strong as I was back then. If it's just a bruise, it will heal on its own. On it's own? No, it won't. It's not impossible and I'm really fine. And I hate it when you blame yourself for something like that. Tsukasa, why do you always do that? I'm not that fragile. Stop it, Yasuhiro. It's so funny, isn't it? Let's not talk about it anymore. I'd better get going. Hey. My parents are out today. Wanna come over? I think I'm done with that. Why? I found a girl I can't leave alone. Huh? You must be joking again. The more I look at her, the more I want to protect her. What happened to you, Hasebe? And she didn't have to hit me or anything. What did you do to upset her? Being popular is a lot of work. Hasebe, you're not interested in seeing just one girl? I've... always had a complicated family. Because of my personality, I was never given any attention. I grew up starving for affection, you know. I'm scared to face one person seriously. So it was like that. I thought I was getting that feeling from you. It must have been hard for you? I lied! What? I wish it was like that, but unfortunately, my parents are totally in love with each other. I just like girls, that's all. You tricked me! I've always been good at things. Whenever something happens, things just seem to go well for some reason. I'm not gonna listen to you anymore. I've been in a lot of relationships like this, but if that was a real relationship, I wonder if the other person would only have me. Just kidding. Hasebe, your love life is yours to do as you please, but please be careful about getting hurt like that. I don't want you to get hurt. There you go. It's done. I'm still okay, at this point. Midori, what do you want to do for this year's festival? Actually, I already planned on going with Takaoka. - What?! - What!? Go on. Go on. What? Don't tell me you're dating Takaoka? That's still a secret. No, since it's our last summer vacation in high school, we decided to have some fun. Tsukasa, what are you going to do? Arima will be there. What? That's what it was, huh? - The festival is coming soon. - Yep! - You're right. - Hey, Yuu. It's the festival. Ah! Tsukasa is here! - Tsukasa, love it! - So cute! - It is, isn't it? - It's nice. I got lost for a moment. Lord Takaoka has arrived! - Were you doing Doraemon? - Yup! I bought a lot of stuff ahead. - Here. - That was fast? You look good. I got overexcited a bit. I wasn't even sure what color to choose. No, I was just surprised at how different it was. You look great. Thanks. Earlier, Midori had stumbled over something trivial. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry, you guys go ahead. Why are you here? I told everyone to go ahead. Well, I... Your shaved ice! Wow, looks delish... I'll be sure to recommend it. - It's really good. - Thank you! Hey, hey, our shaved ice works great on love. You two there. - What? - What? So why not... have some of our shaved ice? Then I'll have a Blue Hawaiian. Order for Blue Hawaiian! - I'll have a Melon. - Sure! - Wait for me while I pay for it. - Thank you. Men should be more assertive. What? Your girlfriend's cute. Soften her up. Blue Hawaiian and Melon. W--What!? Wanna try melon? Sure. How was it? It is melon flavor. Of course it is. I hope they're not worried. We'll meet back with them at that spot earlier anyway. Right. Your foot... Are you okay? Yeah. Don't put up with it. You're a worrier, aren't you, Arima? Am I? I told you, I'm tough. You... You've seen the scar behind Mayu's ear, right? Scar? Yeah. That... was my fault. What? At the end of my first year, I was transferring to a new school, and I talked to her... So, are we gonna be separated? It's all right. The school is far away, but it's not too far by train. - You can't! I don't have it in me. If so, let's break up now. I'd rather we break up here and now than be separated from you. I think Mayu was just anxious about being separated and wanted to test my feelings. But... I didn't pick up on that at the time. Okay. If that's what you want to do, then so be it. That's how I convince myself. I thought I was being kind. Mayu! Mayu! Mayu! Mayu collapsed from anemia due to shock and injured herself on the fence of the flower bed. Wait. That was not your fault. It was an accident when Mayu collapsed. It was my fault, too. I probably wasn't as serious as she was. In love, I was just a kid. As long as that scar is still there. I'll never be able to forget about her. I... didn't think I deserved to be with someone. That's what I always thought... I'm gonna go to the toilet. For telling me something that was hard to say, thank you. Tsukasa... I knew it was hopeless. I can't do this. Found a lost child. Tsukasa, are you alone? No. I was with Arima, but we got separated. Shall we find him together? Wow... That's so beautiful. What's wrong? Huh? Nothing. What are you freaking out about? That's just normal intimacy when someone's in a relationship. It's nothing special. But you do it with someone you love. - I'm sure they don't care about their surroundings. - It's not that great. You're so popular, Hasebe, that you don't understand these feelings. If you really love some-- See? More normal than you thought, right? I can't believe you. You're the worst! [ Guys, I'm sorry! ] [ I can't stand the pain from the sandal strap, so I'm going home. ] What!? Tsukasa! Tsukasa! I know you're in there. Your foot... is it okay? You left suddenly, so I didn't get a chance to finish, do you mind if I continue here? I... I like you, Tsukasa! I'm sorry I'm telling you this now. Tsukasa, you're really a nice person. There were plenty of times that I became aware, but I assumed you were just a female friend. After what happened with Mayu, I told myself that I didn't deserve to be in love. But... I really like you, Tsukasa! I got kissed. I don't want him to know. What should I do? I guess... it's too late now. It's not. Arima. Tsukasa. Akihiro closed his eyes gently and tried to get out of this hopeless world. Because from Akihiro's point of view now, the young man's figure looked like the sun. Hey. We'll stop here for now. Who are you talking about? Could it be Shimazaki from 3-B? - What!? Shimazaki, really? - What....? - Absolutely not! No! Hey, you there! Stop it! - Yes! - Yes, sorry. So sorry... Actually, Midori has asked me to go out again, too. Why? - Huh!? - Huh? You don't know our school's jinx. What? It's said that couples who get together during a student campfire will be together forever, why don't you know that? I mean it's a lie, but you want to have some luck, don't you? I want some luck... It's definitely Shimazaki! No, it's not! What a shocker. Where are you taking that? No... I can do it. I get so lost in the convenience stores. I wonder what I should get. - Thanks, Hasebe. - It's okay. - We really could count on our senior. - Right? Let's go? - Sure! - The green is really good. [ Kitami University High School Cultural Festival ] [ Fortune Telling Booth ] Haunted Cafe. Thank you. Haunted Cafe. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, too. Welcome. Yes, I'll show you. This way. This way. Thank you very much. Arima, we'll take turns. Take a 30-minute break. Thanks. WELCOME! Welcome to our Haunted Cafe. That was funny. Let's go in. Why the hell am I doing this? I'm really sorry for what I did. So... that's enough. Tsukasa, have you seen Arima? - Huh? What's wrong? - He went for a break and never came back. Damn. We'll lose the customers who came for Arima. Ah! Arima, you're late! I'm sorry. They're waiting for you. Come on. I've been in love with you. Then, let's stay as friends moving forward. Okay. Even if you reject me, I'll do my best! They're going to turn it into a campfire at 5:00 p.m.. Arima doesn't need a jinx. Where's Tsukasa? Shinohara? - She was cleaning up a while ago. - Yeah. Where did she go? I think she did just now. Just now? Hey, Arima! What? Let me help you. I'm good. Tsukasa! Let's go watch the campfire. I'll be there shortly. Stop following me. Come on, we can get it done faster together. I just want to forget about it. I don't want to forget it. I don't want to feel like it never happened. At that time, while watching the couple kiss, you were thinking about Arima, weren't you? I don't need you to tell me that, Hasebe. You kissed me as a joke because you found it funny that I was so occupied with Arima. I wasn't joking! Why would I be joking? Why would I kiss a woman who only has eyes for another man? It's because I like you, of course. Sorry. Hoshikawa, have you seen Tsukasa? I saw her and Hasebe walking toward the back west earlier. I'm laughing at myself because I know it's fruitless, but I can't help it. I wished that I was the one that you're thinking of. I'm sorry. - I lik-- - Don't cut me off so soon. You never know. Maybe you could fall in love with me. You're... starting to like me. Hasebe! What's up? Sorry. I'm sorry. I know. I don't know what the future holds, but as long as I have Arima at my core. I'll never fall in love with anyone else. Ever? Ever. Okay. But hey, I'll stay here a little longer. I guess you don't like persistent men. It's 5:00 p.m.. Time to light the campfire. It's 5:00 p.m.. Time to light the campfire. The campfire jinx, why don't you try it with Arima? It's not possible anymore. Why? "Why?" You won't stop liking him, right? It's going to start raining, so please move to the gym with the teachers. Hey! - It's raining. - Seriously? The campfire is lit, but what about the jinx? - Now what? - Seriously? What about Shino? I don't know! Arima. Why are you with him? Wait. Are you jealous, Arima? How can you do that after rejecting Tsukasa? It's none of your business! Arima, don't! Nothing happened. See you later, Tsukasa. Hey, wait! You know, Arima. You always say things like that. That's why you're popular like me. Arima. What... was that just now? You... What did Hasebe do to you? We were just having a little chat. You're free to choose whomever you want. I know that in my head, but... Before I knew it, someone else had taken you away. I... I've gone crazy. Arima! Arima! - I'm sorry. - Wait! There's... something I really need to tell you, Arima. What? You know. Arima... I'm so sorry. I... I... I kissed someone who wasn't you. What!? I've done it, or rather, someone did it to me. The truth is, when you told me you liked me, I was really happy to hear it. So I wanted tell you right away. B-But at that time, I was so confused. I thought I am not qualified to go out with you. I didn't tell you. I'm sorry I ran away. I... I like you too, Arima. The one who kissed you, was it Hasebe? It's... You don't have to worry about him! - I'm sorry. - No! I'm not angry at you, Tsukasa. I'm angry at myself. He was actually right. At such a critical moment, why wasn't I able to protect you? I'm so angry at myself. Can I kiss you? Huh? I'm sorry, but I must. Damn it! I'm so goddamn jealous right now! No way. What do you mean, no way? Even you can get jealous. Of course I would. Because I have never seen you like that before, Arima. I always thought I was the only one who gets jealous. Isn't that kind of unfair? Forgive me. With this, our youth has finally come to an end! Ouch! Who are you!? He's such an idiot. He really is. Watch out! Watch out! - Come on, Tsukasa and Arima! - Come here! Let's go. You know, I can't imagine myself not loving you at all. If I were to fall in love with someone else, I probably wouldn't be me anymore. No matter how many times I get hurt, I love you, Arima. Why are you crying? Of course it's your fault. You have no idea. When my heart is full of joy, I start to cry. How long can you make my heart skip a beat like this? - Hey! Huh? - What are you two doing? - Passionate! - So passionate! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Tsukasa, good for you. Finally! So passionate! I'm sure my heart will never stop beating for you for the rest of my life.
