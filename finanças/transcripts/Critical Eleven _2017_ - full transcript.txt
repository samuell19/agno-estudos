Nya, you're supposed to go to Sydney tonight, right? So where are your things? You're not bringing anything to Sydney? It's in the car. It's only three days, I won't bring a big luggage. I'm just going to put it in the cabin. This is all Tara's fault. Tara! - This is all your fault. - Why? You know that she's going - to Sydney today? - Yes, so? So why is Anya doing all the work and presentations? With me, it's only 50-50. With big clients, let Anya handle it. Eighty percent, it will be successful! Yes! You don't have to decrease the number. If it comes to Anya, it will be 100 percent. I'm sure the Novena client just now, they will choose us as their consultant. Do you know why? Anya, she completely charmed them. - Good job! - Guys... If Anya does all the presentations and client visits as well, so, what are you guys doing? Just taking your paycheque for granted? So if that's the case, what if I come to Sydney as well? Help you with the presentation? You never come with me for my presentation. - Your presentation is at Pulo Gadung. - So? She's going to Sydney. - Hello. - Okay. Guys... - Con-call now in 10 minutes. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. I got to rush to the airport actually. - Safe flight! Bye! - Bye! - Pulo Gadung is far! - In your dreams. Airports have become my second home. And I love this place. Airports for me is just like life. It's a constant change. Always moving. And always about choosing. Choosing where to go. Choosing where to leave or to go home. Choosing what and who will be our destination. And that is why I love airports. Airports are all about choices. Think about it. If we are not brave enough to make choices, no matter how small those choices are... we're not actually living, right? Yes, Mum? Yes. About... a week in Sydney. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard to Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-956 from Jakarta to Singapore. In the world of aviation, there's a phrase called "critical eleven." It refers to the most critical 11 minutes in a flight. Three minutes after take-off and eight minutes before landing. In this critical 11 minutes, all crew must concentrate because 80 percent of flight accidents happen here. (CRITICAL ELEVEN) Excuse me, Mr. Risjad, this is your meal. Excuse me, Ms. Baskoro, this is your meal. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ma'am, sorry. It's clean. I haven't used it. Thank you. Sir. Sorry, I used your handkerchief. It's all right. Have you lost something? Have you lost something? I don't think so. But I think I left it or I misplaced it. Or... - It's really important? - No. Well, yeah. Okay, it's actually something silly. But important for me. Well, okay. I fly most of the time because of my work. But I don't know why I don't like... I don't really like flying. Because it makes me nervous. So I have this small thing... that I hold when I'm nervous. Tiny little dinosaur. - I told you it was silly. - This is yours? Yes, from my childhood. When you think about it, critical eleven could also describe how you met someone for the first time. The first three minutes when the first impression is made. So 70 percent of the time, - you're in the oil rig? - Yes. Yes, not that it's any different with you. You go from one city to another city. I go from one oil rig to another. And the last eight minutes. But you often go back to Jakarta? Sometimes. If I miss ketoprak. - Ketoprak? - Yes. You miss ketoprak? Well, I want to miss a wife but I don't have one. Eight minutes when he smiles, how he moves, his face. determines whether you want the relationship to be something more or just a short encounter. - But I suppose it's hard. - Hard? Yes, if... you have a wife and you only give her ketoprak. No. Din, the usual, two please. (KETOPRAK) - Assalamualaikum! - Waalaikumsalam. This is Anya. Hi, champ! - Here, let me introduce you. - Hi. - Hi, what's your name? - Nino. - Nino! - Finally. You finally brought a girl to this house. - You're so impolite! - This is Keara. - Hi. - This is my love, Keara. - Mum, Ale is here. - Mum! Mum! Mum. - Mum, this is Anya. - Hello, auntie. - I'm Anya. - Sister-in-law, Mum. So this is Anya. Yes, this is Anya. Ale talks about you everyday. - Seriously? - Of course. Yes, of course. You only hug your daughter-in-law, you don't hug your own son. - You! - You don't hug your son, right? Since you were little, you don't want anybody to hug you. Now you're complaining. He's exactly like his father. People think that he's arrogant, but he's just shy. And thank God, when he's a grown man, he doesn't make a fool of himself. Come on, sit down. - Come on, sit down. - Mum, Dad. I almost forgot. Dad! Dad! Where's the special guest? This is Anya, Dad. Nino, what's this? Look! - Thank you, Uncle Ale. - You're welcome. Nya, I'm pretty sure, in your house there will be Legos everywhere. Let's eat everyone. Sit down, honey. Let's eat. Tin, let me introduce you. This is Anya. This is Tini. Her mother used to work for my dad a long time ago. - I see. - Yes. She's so handsome. She's pretty. Why do you say she's handsome? Tini feels so insecure. How's your collection now, Bro? This, you know... I haven't gotten that one, the last Star Wars collection. Attention, everyone! Tonight, we're going to eat. Thank you, Tini. With a special menu. Because we're here to welcome Anya. Welcome to the family. - Uncle Harris! - What? Let's play with the Lego Uncle Ale gave me! - Please try to get use to this! - Of course. Ale, see you. Nice seeing you. See you soon. - Mum, I'll drive Anya home. - Okay. - Anya, you're going home? - Yes. Sorry, I was cleaning up with Tini. - It's all right. See you soon. - Let's meet up again, okay? - Okay, Bro. - She's the most diligent one in the family. - Dad. - Water, please. Dad. - Anya is leaving. - Ale. The house you bought is still empty. What's your plan? It's already been a while that Ale wants to stay there. But I always asked Ale to come home every time he's here. Yes, I'll fill it slowly. Where do you think your wife will stay if your house is still a mess? Yes, Dad. Uncle, I'm leaving. - Dad, see you. - Yes. Be careful, all right. So you like my family? - Yes, a lot. - Yes? And your mum, she's... Her kindness... I don't know. Beyond words. And you know what? She's very beautiful. Seriously! And your dad. What about my dad? He's not as scary as you told me. But I got to say... I kind of miss my parents. They're your parents now. Do you think they like me? Well, they love you. - Really? - Yes. They love you more, I guess, than they love me. - What are you talking about? - Really. - Ale, please. - Yes. I can tell. Really! Well, I'm nobody's favourite, so. No. You're my favourite. My favourite. Thank God. (BRANCHE, BISTRO) Sorry, man. So, Nya. Ale, how big? It's always like this. Her conversation always leads to this. All right, I'm leaving. Donny! You're acting like a sissy. Sit down! - So sissy! - One year in this relationship, what are you guys doing? Playing cards? When you buy a car, you get to do a test-drive, right? We're both already married - so we want to let you know. - Okay. So you're not going to be surprised later. Tell the right things! Yes? Not the ridiculous stuff! I'm being serious here. - Nya. - What? You're really moving to New York? You and Ale are getting married so fast. - You surprised all of us. - Well, you guys. You know what they say, right? When you've met the one, you know. Right? That's not what I meant. Don't you love your job here? You said it yesterday, right? You're not planning to work there? Okay, listen. Of course, I love you, guys. And of course, I love my job here. But come on. New York. Can you say no to New York? I don't think so. - Can I come? - Yes, please! - Nes, we're going to wait in the car. - Okay. Thank you. Sir, I want to pay using Line Pay e-Cash. I accept the hand and marriage of Tanya Laetitia Baskoro binti Ibrahim Baskoro with the dowry of a prayer set and 100 grams of gold. Paid in full. - How is it, witnesses? Official? - Yes. See? It's official! Thank you. For what? I know it's not easy for you to move from Jakarta to New York. Your career, your friends. Right? Well... we are married. So wherever you go, I'll go. Thank you. Are you sure? We could search somewhere in Brooklyn. I'm sure it's cheaper. Only the best for my wife. And it's here in Manhattan. Let's go. - Husband! - Do you like it? Are you kid-- Oh, my God. Look at that view. It's nice, right? Well, it's still empty. But with... a little bit of imagination, we can turn this into our home. Mr. Risjad. You always amaze me. I know that. And you are my home. It's you. - I love you. - I love you more. But I got to say... a nice touch on the apartment. I know that. But the bedroom has a bed already, right? I haven't checked. But actually... we can do it on the floor. (RICHARD RODGERS) (MetLife) Le? If in the future, we'll have children, what do you want them to be? Be anything, as long as they're happy. So they're not like their father. Who went to America just because he doesn't want to be a soldier. Look at him! Hi. Hello! Good throw! - What's your name? - Beckham. - Beckham? - Beckham? Look at that! Another ball. Hey, Beckham, what are you eating? What are you eating? Can I have one? Okay. Okay. Thank you. He's annoyed. Her too. - Give her a hug. - Me? Bye. Can you imagine? Fighting everyday with your own father... always with the same problem. Until my mother cried every single day. It happened all over again. My father used to be very persistent. But Harris didn't go to military school, right? Yes, Dad started to loosen up when I went to America. He's fine. And Harris wasn't pushed to get in to military school. I can't even imagine if he's in the military school as well. He could go crazy. Or maybe the teacher could go crazy because of him. Well, with Harris, that is a possibility. Husband! Husband! What are you thinking? I'm blessed. There's you. There's us here. There's a pretzel! Right? It's almost perfect. Almost? Almost. It will be perfect with just one more. Do you mean Ale junior? Yep. And it will be much more perfect if Ale junior's dad will not leave me alone here. Come on. We talked about this. I know, I know. It's... It's just outside of your comfort zone, right? Sometimes, leaving your comfort zone will make you appreciate what you have. Right? That's true. Come here. How about if you come with me? Okay? Do you want to go with me? To the offshore? Okay. Just get into my luggage. You want to, right? It's going to be okay. I'm just going to be away for a short while. - Anya. - Yes? Your "yes" is so slow and short... means you're very sad. Or very angry. - You don't have to worry. - How can I not worry? You told me about being sad and angry at the same time. I mean, I can understand about the sadness... but the anger? - It's not a big deal. - It is a big deal for me. Tell me. I guess I am... somewhat angry at myself. Well, I always do everything alone... and I'm used to it. And now... you're leaving, and I'm sad. I'm just not used to relying on other people to make me happy. I will do everything... in my power to make you happy. I promise that. Okay. - Hi, Ale! Congrats! - Thank you very much. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. All right, guys. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, hey, man, congrats. Thank you very much. Pedro, how is it going? Hey, newlywed. So you don't need all those porn anymore, right? - Oh, come on, man. Stop it! - Give them to me! - No, I don't have it! - Give them to me! No, I don't have it! Anyway, so are we ready for pumping now? - Yeah. Great, we're ready. - We're ready? Right. Thank you. Great. - Hey, now, Carl... - Hey, man. You all need to get married as soon as possible. (The Eco Laundry Company) Congratulations, we're glad to bring you onboard. Thank you so much. This is a great opportunity for both of us. It's going to be very exciting. - Thank you, Heather. I'll see you. - Thank you. Bye. Hi, Anya. Hi, my husband who's very handsome but very annoying. How are you? Yes, very tired, it's tiring. Today, I... went diving, got dirty and everything else. I cleaned myself already, but still, I think I smell. Why don't you change your clothes? You'll get sick later. Or you want me to get naked? Come on, tell me. By the way... I got the job. Well, Le, I couldn't just sit around in our apartment doing nothing. And it's just a part-time consulting job, so. Okay. Well, if you know what's best for you. Anyways. So when you're there, you're a slob? But now, I'm not home. If I'm away from home, I'm a single man. No way! Wherever you are in this world, your status is the same. The husband of Anya Baskoro. Honey, I miss you. Please open that shirt. You're impolite! - Hey. - Hey. When is your husband coming home? In about three weeks. - You can't wait, right? - Right. - I'll talk to you later. - All right. (HI, HONEY, I'M AT THE CURTAIN!) (IT'S YOU AGAIN! I'M UNDERNEATH THE ORANGES!) (YOU AGAIN! I'M UNDER THE SOFA CUSHION!) (YOU AGAIN! I'M IN YOUR HEART.) So yeah, about the revenue and the cost trends, basically, these will continue to put pressure on the USPS ability to provide affordable universal services. - Hey, husband! - Hey honey, what are you doing? I'm reading a book. I'm surprised that you called. - Where are you reading now? - To... my usual chair. Where else? What are you doing now, honey? I've just finished work. Today was very hectic. Honey. So? So, I don't really miss you. - Why'd you say that? - I don't know. I'm too lazy to even talk to you. All right, so I'll just go for a walk and find a new man. That's nonsense. - Have you taken a shower yet? - I did. - But why are you still smelly? - No way! - You're the one that is smelly! - Really? You've taken a shower, but you don't change your clothes. All you wear is that jersey. Husband! You're up. Why are you so early? In half an hour, it will be sunny. It's still very dark, honey. Yes, it's because you never wake up early before. - I got to go. - No. You're not going. Don't you think I'm sexy this morning? Yes. Let's make love again in the dark with me. In the dark? Again? - Of course. - Again? Really? Ale. Ale! - I have to go. - No, you're not going anywhere. Definitely not today. - Honey. - Yes? Where's my balm? It's in the bedside table. What are you doing? I'm taking a shower, do you want to join me? I want to. Hey, doc. Congratulations, you're pregnant. I hope that's good news. - Of course. - Yes. - Yes, doc. - Sorry, it's fantastic. Yes. For real? Yeah, positive. Everything came back positive. I'm so happy! Hey, guys! You know what, my wife's pregnant! She's pregnant! I could not carry you around. I forgot. I'm scared something will go wrong with the baby later. Honey? It's okay. Having sex during pregnancy's never prohibited by the doctors. - Is it? - Yes. Okay. It's okay, you don't have to worry. Well, I just don't want to hurt you. I know. Mr. Aldebaran Risjad. Out of all the people in the world... you're the only one that would never hurt me. You don't have to worry. Anya! Hey! What are you doing? I saw on the weather forecast that there's 20 percent chance of rain. - Twenty percent? - Yeah. So I'll walk you to your client's office. Okay? And I'm not doing anything today anyway. I'm serious. I know. So why are you laughing at me? No, it's just apparently, you're serious. Okay, let's go. Okay. Excuse me. My wife is pregnant. Could you please give her the seat? No... It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Honey, it's okay. Come on. It's okay, I'll stand up. It's not that far anyway. She's pregnant. It's okay. It's okay. Can you see that sign over there? Okay? Yeah. No, no. It's fine. So, what... Okay. Sorry. She's pregnant. Thanks. Come on, honey. Sit down. (Offer Your Seat To An Elderly, Disabled, Or Pregnant Person) I was so nervous. But just a little. This book is very small, but there are so many names here. I'm starting to get a headache reading it. Okay, so how does Robert sound? Robert? No. - No? - I don't like it. - Why? - Sounds old. - It sounds really old. - Okay. A... Aidan. Aidan? - Aidan? - The little fiery one. - I like it. - I like it too. Yeah, Aidan is nice. The little Aidan Risjad. I like it. - I love it. - We got it. - Yeah! That's it. - So that's it? Hey, Aidan. This is Daddy. What's wrong? Are you okay? Hey... Are you okay? Slowly... Are you okay? Are you okay? Was that a kick? A kick? A kick? What do you mean by a kick? - Can you try and talk to him again? - Hey, Aidan. Aidan. Hey, darling... - That was a kick, right? - Right! - Right. - You feel that, can you? - You can feel it? - Oh, my God! Hey. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! A kick! Hey, Aidan. - Please don't kick your mummy. Poor her. - A kick! Poor her. This is me, your daddy. I love you. I love you too. It's real. It's moving. Nya. I think we should go back to Indonesia. We are going home for Eid Mubarak. No, I mean... we really go back to Indonesia. - Move. - Why? Because everything's easier there. If you're craving something, there's someone that could take you. If you want to go somewhere? There's someone who's going to drive you. Your friends are there. It would be easy for you, right? There's my parents that could take care of you. Ale, please don't joke around. Your parents couldn't possibly take care of me, right? I'm serious. Why not? Honey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. It's just you've been weird lately. It's because you're pregnant. Exactly, Ale. - I'm pregnant. - Yeah. I'm not sick. I'm fine, okay? - Okay. - You can stop overreacting now. Usually, I'm okay doing everything on my own. I'm a big girl. I know. Hey, honey. I just finished work. In Brooklyn. Yes, I'm heading home now. There's a farmer's market, do you want me to get you something? There's food, there's eggs, I'm sure there's waffles... Are you okay? Oh, my God, you're pregnant. Thank you. Anya, are you okay? Yeah. - Is she okay? - All set. Yeah, she's fine. Only some minor bruises. There you go. I'm fine. It's fine, Ale. Right, doc? - I'm fine? - Yes, the baby looks great. We're just hoping that Anya can be a bit more careful next time. Not get hit by any more bicycles next time. We're going home now. We're going home. Now. Okay, doc, so I'll be seeing you in two weeks? Yes, two weeks and we'll do another check. - Okay. - To ease your mind. Until then... - be well. - All right, thank you. If you're fine, you wouldn't need that Band-Aid. - That's all I'm saying. - I'm fine, Le. It's just a minor flesh wound. Look at that! Literally, just small scratches when you got hit by something not important. I'm all right. Just because of this, why should we go home to Indonesia? What? What did you say about going home? Do you know there's a small difference between being okay and not okay? Do you know that? - Ale. - You just don't get it, that's it. Honey, you've been so weird. Yes, because you're pregnant. How many times should I say it? It's because you're pregnant. Exactly. And I'm fine. Look, I can still stand. - I can still take a walk... - Do you think this is a joke? No, it's not. I'm... - Ale... - But seriously, do you think it's a joke? Because I don't. - Okay? - Honey. The doctor didn't tell me to have a bed rest. The doctor didn't even warn me. That I shouldn't do anything. You can see yourself that I'm okay. You think it's a joke. I know that. - Le, please. - I don't get it. Seriously, I don't get it. So it is a joke for you, right? I'm sorry I said that. You always say that. Always. - Honey. - It's a good thing I'm here. What if I was in Mexico when this happened? What if it wasn't a bicycle that hit you? But it's not. Okay? But you're here now. And look at me, I'm fine. And so is Aidan. Hey, hey... Husband, are you okay? Yes. You've been awfully quiet. Yes, if I talk, you'll say that I'm overreacting again. This is New York. We don't have anyone here. If you know what I mean. What about my job? You can ask Agnes. She can give you back your old position. Your office would definitely take you back. Definitely. You really want us to go back to Jakarta? This is all for Aidan, Anya. Come on. Le. I'm already comfortable here. Do you remember? You told me that you will do anything. Anything in your power to make me happy. And I'm happy here. I love New York. More than Aidan. All right. That's not what I mean. It's... Hey, Anya. Hey, Anya! Anya, hey, can you slow down, please! Be careful when you cross that road, please! You don't have to run, hey! Sorry! Anya, I'm really sorry for what I've just said. I'm truly sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Seriously, I'm sorry. Okay? What you meant just now is that I don't love Aidan, right? I didn't say that. Now you're putting words into my mouth. I'm not putting words into your mouth. I'm just saying words in your mind. So I'm wrong if I want the best for Aidan? - You're not wrong, Le. - So, what's your point? It's just the way you say it. It's as if you say I don't want the best for Aidan as well. So how should I say it? Maybe you shouldn't say anything at all! Can you please calm down, okay? - Seriously, can you please calm down? - No, just... No. - You don't have to be so emotional... - I just need my time to be alone. So I'm sorry. Okay. Hi, Bill. Sorry, can you do me a favour, please? Yeah, so here's the thing. Do you know, Le? Everytime you leave... I'm here alone. First week, second week, I was fine. But the third week, I became... lost somehow. I was going crazy. Then I started to learn. To deal with it. Yes, I'm here alone everytime you leave. I sorted out my emotions. I organised my emotions that will make myself uneasy. I managed to create a life here. And it's very satisfying for me. I mean, this is New York. This is... This city is tough. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Okay, here... - Hold on. - You understand what I mean, right? - Yes. - It makes sense, right? - I understand. Because you don't look like you do. Why are you laughing? I'm serious. Mrs. Risjad. You are so stubborn. And I love you so much. - Okay, here... - It's important for me... to see that you understand what I meant. I don't want you to think that I'm being selfish. Okay, I get it. Yes. I get it. I've never thought that you are selfish. Ever. When you agreed to move to New York. Staying here. I know that you're thinking of me. So I'm closer to here from Mexico. You're not selfish, right? Right? - Exactly! - Exactly! Exactly! I've made a call. And you know what? They granted my request. I got transferred to K.S. Drill. The base is in Jakarta. The oil rig is in the Java Sea. Okay? - K.S. Drill? - Yes. That's a... That's a... - That's a really good company. - I know, it is. Okay? For me... it doesn't matter if it's New York or Jakarta. I don't have a problem. As long as the three of us are together, always together. You both are my home. So please... come back to Jakarta. Okay. Le. Hi, Honey. Good morning Mrs. Aldebaran Risjad. I was looking for you. Morning. What are you doing? Preparing a crib for Daddy's little champ. What time did you wake up? At 5:00. Why didn't you wake me up? No, you have to rest, you're still jet lagged. Does it have to be finished by today? I'm not going to give birth to Aidan tomorrow. Daddy can't wait to see Aidan. I want to see my little champ. So, everything has to be ready. - What are you doing? - Hold still. What are you writing on me? So mischievous. - What are you writing? - Wait, hold still. What are you writing? This is... every superhero has to have a costume. Good morning. Good morning, darling. Daddy is hungry. - Is that a clue? - Yes. - Make me breakfast, please. - Okay. - I want to eat. - Scrambled eggs. With a side of you. - Has the baby started kicking? - He kicks very hard. Especially when his dad talks to him. When I talk to the baby, I can feel him moving and start kicking. He wants to play basketball with me. What time are you leaving tomorrow? At 9:00 in the morning. - At 9:00 in the morning? - Yes, Dad. - He hasn't kicked yet. - Not yet. The baby hasn't started kicking at 9:00. But mummy does. You have to visit us more often... - rather than staying alone at home. - Listen to her. But I'm used to it, in New York I'm always alone. That was New York. You are here now with us we are your family too, aren't we? That's right, Nya. We can go shopping together. - Really? - Of course. Can I join too? Really? You want to join us? Okay, but you just wait in the parking lot. Are you kidding me? I'm good-looking and I have to be the driver? It suits you. Attention Mr. Harris, someone is waiting for you. Hi. Look at my belly, it's getting huge. It looks like it's not as painful. - It's trending, Nya. - Right? Ale is quite a champ. You're only with him for a while and you're already pregnant. He drills so often on the rig, so he must be good at drilling his wife. Tara! Don, what are you doing? Your belly is that big and Ale still makes you work? I'm the one who wants to work. But you don't have to worry, Nya. While you're pregnant... you don't have to present in the client's office. Your route will only be from office to your house, and that's it. Thank you. I think I needed that. Because in my house it's been like... I'm very happy that our gang is complete again. These sort of things... no wonder people think of you as a sissy. Is that why? Let's get to work. See you. Donny is annoyed. I was about to show you this. It's my wife. - She's really hot. - I know. You're a lucky man! But the thing is... I still don't know why she said "yes." One thing I'm sure of, it's not your personality. No. Come on. Why do you have to say that? She's very beautiful. Hi, honey. It think the baby's been sleeping all day. He's hardly moved. Last time, it was three hours ago... and I could hardly feel it. Do you want to try to talk to him? Hold on. Dan, Daddy wants to talk. Aidan what are you doing, darling? Please come out fast. So it will not be painful for Mummy. Daddy misses Aidan very much. Husband, I just felt the baby move but not as hard as usual. Thank God. All right. Sorry to disturb you while you pack. It seems I'm the one who is paranoid now. That's why you should listen to your husband. Alright then, I'll see you soon. I love you. Love you too. Bye. Aidan. Guess what Mummy bought. When Mummy buys a toy for you, it'll be something like this one. Roaming Dino. Lego is what your dad will get for you. Let's open this one. Look at this. Aidan likes Legos more just like Daddy? Aidan? You're usually happy when Mummy's talking to you. Darling, are you sleeping again? Sa, are you busy? Can you go with me to the hospital? Hi, Sa. - What is it, doc? - Just a moment. Sa, what happened? Where's Anya? Inside. What is it, doc? What's wrong, doc? What's wrong? The baby's heartbeat can't be detected. I'm so sorry. Doc, can you please check again? I've checked three times. The death was caused by a knot in the umbilical cord. So the foetus was unable to receive oxygen and nutrients. I recommend that Mrs. Anya be induced as soon as possible... in order to deliver tonight. - It has to be tonight, doc? - The sooner the better. How is Mrs. Anya's psychological condition? Is she ready to receive the news? We have to tell her. We have to tell her, doc. Oh, God! My deepest condolences. Le, I want to go home. I want to rest. Doctor said that... But you said I need rest. I want to rest. I want to do what you said. Le, the delivery is still next week, right? Anya... I want to go home. This... I want to go home. Good. Good. It's coming out. Push. Push. Okay, push. Push slowly. (Delivery Room) I want to meet Aidan. Uncle, now I want to make the wings. - Uncle? Uncle Ale! - Yes. - The plane is ready now. - Great. Awesome... Nya. How do you feel? Anything that we say right now... it will not make you any less sad. But you have to know, Nya. Anytime you need me... Tara. We are here for you. I know. Thanks. Are you thinking about Aidan? Ale. How's work? Good. Busy? Quite busy. Me too. Next month, I'll start drilling again. That's good. How's Tara and Agnes? Good. You know Tara, she is always active. Agnes and Ario are trying to have less activities because they're trying to have a baby. Maybe if you weren't so busy, Aidan would still be alive. No... I'm... I didn't mean... Anya, please. Anya? We almost never come here without Agnes and Tara, right? Yeah, I think you're right. You, okay? Does it look like there's something wrong? Anya. You just went through difficult times... and almost everyday, you work overtime. Isn't it normal if I want to know how you are doing? I need distraction, Don. Agnes and Tara seem busy with their own businesses. It doesn't seem fair if I disturb them. So I distract myself in the office. Lately, you've also been staying late at the office. Your girlfriend doesn't complain? With Nicole, right? No, seriously? Since when? A month ago. Why didn't you tell me? You have your own problems, Anya. I'm your best friend. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. - Mum. - Hi. Hi, Nya. Is something wrong, Mum? Does a mother have to ask for permission to visit her own child? No. But Ale is at the rig, Mum. Anya. You are also my child. I'm here with Tini. She can help you around the house. Ma'am Anya, what would you want to drink? I'm good, Tini. Thank you Mum, I'm good without Tini. I'm used to being alone. Why do you have to be alone when you have a family? We are also your family, Anya. Anya. I know how you feel. - Pressure report? - 900, Sir. Ale, can I have a word with you? So the boys are talking about you now. You're a different man now, Risjad. Look, I know you've been through a lot. But I can't have you making mistakes. You of all people understand that, as well as anyone. Wait... Hold on. I can still do my work. - So that's your point, right? - No, that's not my point. - No, that's your point! - No, the point is, you look like shit. And your attitude is killing morale for the rest of us. You knew it wasn't going to be easy. Coming out here, living, working like this. So, what do you want me to do? Act like there's nothing happened? So I'm not allowed to feel sad. I'm sorry. Honestly, I'm sorry for your loss. Why don't you take two months off? Are you serious? We're preparing for the drilling. Soon. Look, you sit this one out better off at home with your wife. You're a wreck now. Can you imagine how your wife is feeling right now? Don't you think... maybe she needs you more than we do out here? Look, I'm sorry. I get it. Do you remember, when you told me about the presentation at your office? When you told me you're making a presentation and doing a task, you work out a full-scale strategy. Can you try to imagine as if we're crossing a bridge. We're heading to a place. Then we burn the bridge down once we crossed it. So there's no turning back. Did you get my point? That is how I feel about you. When I'm with you, I feel like I've burned the bridge down. Will you marry me? - Are you serious? - I'm serious. In front of Mr. Sudi? So there's a witness, Ma'am. Mr. Sudi knows that Ale wants to propose? Of course he knows. So... will you marry me? Yes. - Really? - Yes! I... I'm taking some time off from work. So I'll be at home more often. - Tin? - Yes, Ma'am? Please prepare dinner for Mr. Ale. Anya, can we talk about this, please? Anya. You can't keep being like this with Anya. You remember how things with Aga and I went, right? It was like this at the beginning. We didn't communicate with each other. I've tried talking to her. She never responds. And it's not only once. But you know that this is hard for Anya. This is hard for me too, not only for Anya! Everyone says... This is not easy for Anya. What about me? It's hard! Seriously! I'm sorry. I just don't want you to end up like me. I took some time off from work. And for the next few months, I won't be going back to the oil rig. You're taking some time off but you're like this with Anya? What's the difference with you being in the oil rig? You're here, but you are never there for Anya. It must be more painful for her. There's some important information that I want to share. So our office in Melbourne needs someone to transfer there. This is a very big project. I'm torn about who between us should go. - Why don't you go? - Yes. Well, I can't, although they requested me to go there. That's the first news. The second one, why I can't go to Melbourne? Nya... What is it? Soon... there's going to be Ario and Agnes junior! Oh, my God! Congratulations! - Finally! - Thank you! After all this time, Nya! - How's Ario? - Ario is very happy. You know how we've been waiting for this baby, right? - Hello! - Smells good! - Hi! How are you? - Good. - Ale! - This suits you already. Hi, darling! You're getting heavier! - Hi, Ale. - Uncle Harris! Is the satay ready? - Happy anniversary! - Thank you, honey. - Hi, Nya! - Hi! - Here you go, the satay is ready. - Finally! By Chef Harris. Come, take it. This one is chicken. - There's no sausages? Do you want some? - Yes, I want it. It's ready. I know but we're short in sausage. I want it, Harris. I thought everyone prefers this one. Le, can you come with me to Puncak tomorrow? Yes, I can. It's been a while since I visited the villa. After that, we'll go to Aidan's grave. Anya, you can stay here and go with me to the supermarket. Anya, I'll take you home? Yes, Mum. Is Anya still mad at you? You don't have to cover it up. What's the use of me being an intel officer if I can't read my own children? - Does Mum know, Dad? - Mum? There can't be a secret at Mum's place. She's the best intel in the house. Is it about your child? Yes. I told Anya... Maybe if she wasn't so busy, Aidan would still be alive. Anya? Come here. I want to talk with you. Is that okay? It's okay if you don't want to. Because we can't always be strong. To be the perfect woman... is the heaviest burden. As well as becoming a wife and a mother... that is strong... does not happen in an instant. It takes time. Process. Two years before you were born, your mother was pregnant. Sebastian! I was unable to give a family name behind it. That was your brother. That's how it should have been. It turned out... it was not your father and mother's time. Your mother had a miscarriage. And I didn't want to... look sad in front of your mother. I ran from the house. Burying your own son... is the biggest grief for any parent. Especially for a mother. In the past, I also... experienced that kind of loss... myself. Sebastian Risjad. Ale's brother. After a few years, I started to ask... why did your mother take me back? When there was a million reasons... for your mother to reject me. I was an insensitive husband. But she had one reason why she... accepted me back. Your mother promised that she would always be there for me as her husband. In good times and in bad. I'm sure... you and Anya... also have more than one reason... to persevere in your marriage. Come. How long did it take... for you to...? Quite long. Until your father-in-law... stood together with me... to carry on with our lives. In the end, we accepted it together. What happened in the past, is not our fault. It's also not yours. Step by step. I have faith... that you can forgive yourself. Yes? Okay. - Idris? - Yes? Yes, Mr. Ale. What is it? Does father come here often? Father you mean. Yes, quite often, Sir. Sometimes he comes alone, sometimes with your mother. What about my wife? I'm sorry, Sir. But which one is your wife? As far as I'm aware of, she's never been here, Sir. - All right then. - Yes, Sir. - Hi, I'm sorry. I'm so late. - It's okay. What are you guys talking about? Brainstorming names for Agnes' baby. That's fun. What do you have so far? If it's a girl, it would be Annabelle? Cute, right? Ario wants it to be a boy. So every night when he talks to my belly, he calls it "Yoyo Junior." Doesn't it bother you? Why Yoyo? We're still not sure whether it's a boy. - Right? - Is Ario like that? But he's so nice. Can you imagine, in one day he can call me 10 times. - Seriously? - Just to ask, "What are you doing?" It's unusual. He's a changed man ever since I became pregnant. - He's much more caring now. - But that's good. Yes, it's a good thing. But sometimes, he can be over possessive, overprotective. He's changed drastically and you can tell, it's like night and day. I'm sorry, I'm fine. It's okay. What about Ario? Nya? I'm sorry, I don't... I'm sorry, I'm ruining everything. I don't mean to. It's... Anya, what's wrong? What's wrong, darling? It's okay. Let it out. I really miss Aidan. It's time to tell us everything, Nya. These past few days, Ale has been so nice to me. Very considerate. I know he feels guilty. I know that. But I can't stop being angry at him, Nes. I was like, "I know I should forgive him." Nya, I think Melbourne is the best option. Take it, Nya. You know... you need some time alone. Yeah, you're right. I do need my time alone. If you also think that Melbourne is the best solution... I support you. A hundred percent. Why is Anya sending me this sort of text? (I'M SORRY WE'RE LIKE THIS.) What is it this time? Hello, Sis. Do you know that Ale and Anya are having a fight? I know. Okay. Ris, Anya is leaving. Oh, my God. - Did she pick up? - Not yet. Try calling her from my phone. - Well? - It's ringing, but she's not picking up. It's ringing. Call her again. My friend saw her at Cafe Beranda. - Where? - Cafe Beranda. Beranda? Beranda... I know where that is! Surprise! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you (NEW AGE ALE) Come on! You can continue that at home. Thank you very much! This one is Uncle Ale's, please don't ask for it. - This one is hard to get. - Grandpa will buy you a real tank later. Chicken! Chicken! Chicken! Where's Ma'am Anya? Sorry. Ma'am Anya went out. Where did she go? It's Saturday. She left with her suitcase, Sir. She didn't tell you where she went? No. (MEETING IN SINGAPORE. BE BACK TOMORROW.) Finally it's over. Oh, my God. Singapore is supposed to be for holidays not work. (I'LL FLY IN. WE CAN DO A WEEKEND GETAWAY IN SG. WHERE DO YOU STAY?) (SORRY, I'M BUSY HERE.) - Tin. - Yes, Sir? Can you make me a coffee, please. Nya, you're going to be in Jakarta for New Year's eve, right? Nya? You're going to be in Jakarta for New Year's eve, right? Why? No, are you going to take the job in Melbourne? Oh, that. Yeah... I'm still not sure, Nes. I need to think about it. - Right. - You're still thinking about Ale? Yes. I'm not sure how I should deal with everything that's happened. Things get a little bit more complicated. Well, a lot more complicated. - Tin. - Yes, Ma'am? Please take my suitcase upstairs. Yes. Anya? Honey? Hey. You look so tired. You, okay? What's wrong? I can't do this, Le. Do what? Hey. Well, this. Us. I can't. I just can't. Anya, I thought we're fine. - I don't know you anymore. - You don't know me? Anya, I haven't changed. Oh, my God. You used to work hard to build our son's room everyday, now you never enter Aidan's room even once, Le. Why are we talking about this? Le, that is Aidan's room. Our son! This is important to me. - It seems like you don't care... - Aidan is not there, Anya. I could enter his room a thousand times and Aidan would still be dead. Now, you're blaming me? You say I'm the one who doesn't care? Every week, Anya. Every week, I clean his grave. I prayed there. Where were you? Please don't compare who cares more or less... So you're allowed to question why I never enter Aidan's room but I'm not allowed to ask why you never visit Aidan's grave. You're so selfish. I feel so alone. You're never here. You have a family. You have Nino. We're supposed to be together, Le. I still don't have Aidan, Anya. For you, that's my fault, right? According to you, was it your fault? Think about it. Ma'am Anya, where are you going? I'll leave it to you to take care of the house, Tin. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Sir, but the office is closed. Yes, I know, I want to see my wife. Please, Sir. Sir, I want to see my wife. Do you know Mrs. Anya? - Do you know Mrs. Anya? - Yes, I know her. I want to see her. You can't, Sir. The office has closed. - Sir! - What do you want? We have rules, Sir. I know you have rules, Sir. I want to see my wife. Can't I do that? We're only following orders. It's okay, Sir. This is my friend. - All right, Sir. - Thank you. - What's wrong, Le? - Where is Anya? Anya is not here. - What's wrong? - I called her, but she didn't pick up. I called Agnes, I called Tara, but no one picked up my call. So I thought she's in her office. Anya is not here. Okay. Ale. You're the only one that Anya loves, okay? More than anything. You should know this. Okay. Thanks. Sorry about the mess. Mr. Aldebaran Risjad, out of all the people in this world, you're the only one that would never hurt me. I will do everything in my power to make you happy. Hello? Nya. Thanks, Ris. Can I tell you something? Yes. I'm planning to propose to Keara. That's good. If I can love Keara... as much as Ale loves you... there's nothing I should be afraid of. Nothing. Can you please tell me that he's going to be okay, Ris? He's going to be fine... right? Of course, Nya. - Honey. - Hi. - Are you okay? - Yes. It's not your fault that Aidan passed away. Can we please not discuss this right now, Le? Anya's Ale would like to say sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. Do you know? The first time we met on the plane... do you know what I was thinking about? How to stop the plane from landing, and keep flying. So I could always be next to you. Not to be apart from you. Because I met a woman... that made me ready... to burn the bridge together. I'm really sorry. (AIDAN ATHAILAH RISJAD Bin ALDEBARAN RISJAD) (Born: Jakarta, 14 February 2017 Died: Jakarta, 14 February 2017) It's okay. It's okay. Just let it out, okay? This is our meeting room. This is Felice. Hi, Felice! This is Renata. My secretary. Thank you. This is the teleconference room. Dimas? In the world of aviation, the first three and last eight minutes are the most critical moments during a flight. Tara. - This is Renata. - Tara. Hi. Junior Financial Advisor. Right, working under Donny. Okay, have you met Donny? - Not yet. - Don? Hi, Don. Let me introduce you. - Hi. Renata. - Hi, Renata. I'm Donny. Renata will be our new colleague. Renata will be our Junior Financial Advisor. But in life... critical eleven may not be determined by the first three minutes. Hi. - Can I come in? - Yes, of course. Any plans this afternoon? Afternoon? Work, I guess. Are you planning to eat? Eat, of course. You mean lunch break, right? No. I want to ask you out for lunch. Lunch with Mr. Donny? Of course not, together with Tara, Agnes and the others. But if you prefer just the two of us, that would be fine. If you want. - Okay. - Okay, what? Lunch with Mr. Donny. - You want to have lunch with me? - Yeah. Just the two of us, right? Yes, of course. Just the two of us. The two of us having lunch. So later? This afternoon? - Okay! - Okay! Careful. Watch out. Maybe, those critical moments will appear after three days... or three months... or even three years. (WELCOME HOME ANSEL) The first three years of our marriage wasn't really smooth. And after eight years, who knows? Ale and I only know one thing. We love each other so much. Love. So much love. Why do you suddenly cut me off? - Do you still want it? It's halfway. - Do you still want it? You're full. Are you full, honey? It's all right. Have you made your wish yet? - What was your wish? - What was it? - Ansel wants a little brother. - You want a little brother? - Congratulations! - You want a little brother. There's no need to be over excited. I'm annoyed. All right, Ansel, go out and play. So that Mum and Dad can make a baby. Awesome. - Where's your friend? - Tara? She's in Japan, right? - Yes, with her husband. - What is she doing? Seeing Juki's parents. Paying a visit. She always stayed long while in Japan. - Shall we go there too? - Let's go. Look! Look! Look! Look. There's Uncle Donny. What did he bring? - What do you say? - Thank you, Uncle Donny. You're welcome, honey. Uncle Donny, who? Mum's sweetest best friend in the world. Mum's sweetest best friend in the world.
