Come on! Come on! Get a move on! – Mr. Benson! – Yes? Mrs. Boyd-White! – Well, well? – She says she can't cover! – Then tell Joe to sell her out! – Yes, sir! – Benson Company! – Yes, I will! Oh, I'm so sorry, Captain! – Stocks are up? – Oh, shut up! Hello, Mohler! – I must see you! – All right, all right! Come into my office! – Mr. Benson, sir! – Yes? We're all clean up now, except for that big account! – Oh, you mean Gray! – Yes, sir! What is the status now? 380 thousand! Tried to notify him? All day yesterday and today! Well, try…! Oh, never mind! Sell him out, sell him out! Well, you heard me! – Sell him out! – Yes, sir! Ah, Miss Leslie! Get those bottle packages out of the stairs, and bring them to my office! Yes, sir! – But I tell you, it is most necessary I get this back! – All right, all right! In a minute! – Miss Leslie! – I'm coming, sir! Oh, thank you! Well! Here they are, and you owe the note to me too! Pay the note, and you'll get it back as well! The note's due tomorrow! – But I cannot pay! – Oh, then you don't get this, or this! – Since you can't pay the note! – Oh, Tony, are you not my friend? Sure! If I weren't, you wouldn't forge my name to this check, would you? Oh, I… I… Yes? All right, tell her I'll be there in a minute! – But, I must have it, Tony! – Try and get it! – But if you don't give it to me, I will… – Aw, you won't do anything! Who do you think I am? One of your faded widows? And I'm not very afraid of male lapdogs! Well, well! Interesting to see you fight for something besides me for a change! Miss DelRoy, Mr.Mohler! – Hello, Dolphy! – Hello, Fanny! He knows you, too? What are you all atwitter about, anyway? You, er… "borrowed" these from your meal ticket, didn't you? And she's in Paris, isn't she? Well, you'd better pay me somehow, and return them before she gets back, musn't you? Yes? What did he mean, your meal ticket is in Paris? Where did you think I picked what I gave you? – From the street? – Mrs. Banning's here? – Who?! – Tell her I'll see her in a minute! Well, old boy, your meal ticket's back! Perhaps she brought you a Parisian dachshund! – Ooohh! – Ha, ha, ha, ha! What is this? What's that dullard just have to like that I haven't? When you are a big boy, … – …maybe I'll tell you! – Yes? Well, let me tell you something, …! …darling! We sold you out of the market this morning! You haven't got a dime! You…! You didn't! Yes, but, my dear, my own, why didn't you cable you were coming? My dear darling, I did cable! You just must've been out! Oh, I was hunting in the mountain! And I was dying for you to come back to me! What… what did you come here for, Paula? Do not tell me you're blocked in the market? My dear boy, I don't know! I only heard of the crash when I arrived this morning! I've been nearly frantic! But, of course, Tony Benson will carry me! Oh, yes, yes! – Where is Tony? – Oh, wait, wait! Tony Benson, you're a cold scoundrel! You had no right to sell me out! You could give me another day to cover! You didn't have anything to cover our margin call! Oh, I could've brought you my pearls, then! Say, what's in that box? – No, no, no, no! – Oh, Tony, darling! I simply must know where I stand! You carried me, of course! No! You were a little overweight! Tony! Oh, Mr, Gray! We tried to get in touch with you! I've been out of town! I was going to mail this to you, ahh, … You see, it was the last account we had that wasn't covered, so, … I understand! Ah, … Mr. Gray, would you mind waiting in the waiting room? Ahh… There's someone else in Mr. Benson's office! Ah, all right! Yes, I sold you out, all of you! All except Adolph, who wasn't even in! No, it's something else your dear Adolph goes in for! – Not the market! – Benson, I am going to… Never mind! – Oh, you are busy, Tony! – No, come in, Harry! – A storm seems to be arriving! – Looks as if one has already arrived! – I'll come back when you're alone! – All right, Harry! I have nothing more to say! You are not a gentleman, Mr.Benson! – You are a… – I know, I'm a flat! Well, is it my fault if you're on the high seas when the market breaks? – I've a good mind to… – You won't do anything! Mohler said he would, but he won't! None of you will! Oh, I suppose if you could, I'd be a corpse by now! Well, you were called out for margin, weren't you? You wanted to have your cake, and eat it too! Easy money, quick profits! Well, you gambled, and you lost! Yes, you lost! You lost, I said! Dolphy, dear, don't you have anything to say to this person? – The way he's talking… – With what I have on him? Oh, go on, get out of here, all of you! Go on! Go on, get out! Leave me alone, I'm no longer in! Hello, reception? Get my chauffeur at the garage, … …tell him to meet me at the club! At 6 o'clock, yes! I'm going to spend the night at my place, up the river, and I don't want to be disturbed! All right! Yes, come in, Harry! Even the heavens seem to be crashing! Say, Harry, … …why don't you spend the night with me at my place, up the river? Not a bad idea! We can, ahh, … meet at the club, at 6 o'clock, and… …have a steam and a rubdown, before we go. I'm nervous! I don't blame you! After that gang that was just in here! I wouldn't like to do this! Well, … …maybe not! You know, Harry, … …I'm sorry I had to sell you out! But then, you big shots are used to taking it on the chin! – Not twice in succession! – Twice? Big Drake walked off with 180 grand of mine last week! He did? Yes! He hiked Collins! Oh! Harry, why don't you quit that racket? I like it! Harry…! …you're not sore at me, are you? I haven't made up my mind… yet! Three thousand you owe me! Yeah! Three grand! I've got the jump! No wonder, after what you said to me today! Oh, well! Those cry babies at the office got on my nerves! Well, I put a couple of twos and twos together. Watching DelRoy and Mohler. Ahh, … Let's go to bed, eh? Oh, I left my bag at your club! I'll phone for it! You'll have to rough it, though! I let the servants go for the winter! What was that? – Backfire, I guess. – Oh, Markham's car, maybe! Whose? Markham! The District Attorney! You know him, don't you? We've had a couple of talks. – What's he doing here? – He's got a place next to mine. He's up here, resting from the campaign. Hello, Fanny! Adding a little burglary to your other accomplishments, eh? Ha, ha, ha, ha! I want that jewel case Mohler gave you! Ooh, hoo! So he borrowed them from you, and not Paula Banning, eh? – Well, what do you think of that fella, ha, ha, ha! – Hurry, Benson, … …I was going to give those pearls to you, to cover my account, but I couldn't find them! Hurry what? That jewel case is in my office safe, where it'll stay! Oh, no, it isn't! I saw it in the pocket of your coat, as you left today! That's right! I forgot! I was upset! They're in my coat pocket, downstairs. Oh, I… I'm sorry! Excuse me! – Don't move! – Aahh! What do you mean, frightening me like this? Will you have a drink? What? Suit yourself! Oh, Tony! Who's that? It's Gray! I'll… I'll get rid of him now! – Friend of yours! – Huh? – Tony, I want you to… – Oh, excuse me, please! My coat You… are leaving, perhaps? What? Oh, no, not at all! What was the noise out back? Window blew shut! Must've been open! Tony, I must plead for my poor darling! He had no idea he was doing anything wrong when he signed that check! You were such friends! I shouldn't have left him! Then you'd better pay his note to me! Heavens, Tony, I haven't the ten thousand! I tell you I've lost everything! And the bank won't advance me another cent! What are you doing here? Not, my dear Anthony, that it's difficult to guess! Aahh! Mrs. Pot! – Pot? – Yes! Calling the kettle black! Heh, heh, heh, heh! You girls ought to get together on Mohler, Paula. Who do you suppose he was running around with, while you were…? Paula, … – …I think you'd better go to rest! – Do not dare to touch! You for me! What's your name? Harry, … …to you! What's yours? Fanny… to you! Tony! Let's have a party, uh? Oh… Heh, heh, heh, heh! Heh, heh, heh! Are you going to give me that case? No! I would! Now, look here! What's going on here, anyway? – Have you got a flashlight? – Yes, there's one over here! Come on! – Here it is! – Here, I'll go! I want that jewel case Mohler gave you! And I'll get it! For what? Nothing! Oh! Well, we'll see about that! Do you think you can hang on to Mohler with Paula Banning back? And if she finds out he's been running around with you, where would you be? She'll stop his allowance! You know, ahh…? Heh…! He hasn't told her about your pearls! – I'll take care of that! – Yeah? Well, you take care of his note somehow, if you want this! Say, why all this frenzy about a few pearls? There are plenty more where these came from, aren't they? What about this, anyway? I have to sell them! You sold me out, didn't you? Oohh! Well, let's have a look! Say, listen! Now, wait a minute! Oh! Heh, heh! I… I… I come in! I… I… I'm glad you are here! Tony might have misconstrued my, ahh… …arriving this way, had he been alone! Well, he certainly got plenty of company now! Say, what are you people trying to do anyway? – Remove this guy? – Oh, no, no! Ha! – Well, let's go upstairs! – Yes, ahh… Heh, heh! I'll tell you why I won't in four words! I don't like you! As if you liked… …all your playmates! Heh, heh! I've had to put up with a lot of you, big businessmen, to get somewhere else, … …but now I'm there, … …I'm putting up with the ones I pick! And I told you a year ago, I wasn't picking you! Your eyes are too close together, get it? And let this sink under that toupee of yours… …I'm going to get that jewel case of mine! Oh, I beg your pardon! Tony, … This was the big noise! Oh! Hello, Tony! – Hello, Adolph! – Oh, Fanny! Dolphy! Is that my boy? Paula! What are you doing here? Oh! Carrying out without me, eh? No, but that might be a good idea! When you told me he would put you in jail, I simply had to come here, and throw myself on this mercy! Tony! He's my heart! Oh, please! Be quiet! You know, while you've been away, he's been playing around a bit! – Dolphy, it's not true! – Paula, … …don't change the subject! Give him his money! Do you want him to put me in the jail? I'll fix him, kill him first! If you don't mind, I have first call on him for that! Well! That makes it unanimous! Farewell, Caesar! Or, … shall we say it with flowers? Say, what is this? Must be my birthday! – Ahh, Markham! Come in! – Hello, Benson! I just thought I might… Oh, I beg your pardon! That's quite all right, come in! Ahh! Thunder and lightning! – Enter the villain! – Ha, ha, ha! – How are you, Mr. District Attorney? – Hello, Gray! Ahh… Miss DelRoy, Mr. Markham. And… Mr. Mohler! Excuse me! You'll have to put me up for the night! I punctured a tyre! Plenty of room! Thanks! Gray, you must be behaving yourself! The newspapers haven't accused you of anything for months! I can't imagine what you're talking about! Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh, Benson, … …I wanted to talk to you about this market affair. I suppose there'll be some trouble. I think you could give me the advice I need. Let me take your coat! No, thank you, I have a friend with me outside… By the way, Gray, … …he'd like to meet you! – Do you mind if I bring him in? – Not at all! Thanks! You know, Markham seems to be quite interested in you! Well, if he is, it won't do him any good! Paula is just so upset. You don't mind if she lies off for a moment? I shall be prepare her something. Sure! We've all been too excited, anyway! Here you are, Gray! Philo Vance! Mr. Benson! – Mr. Benson… – How do you do, Mr. Vance! Harry Gray! Mr. Gray… Not the detective! It is! Only as an amateur, remember! Our friend, Sergeant Heath, insists on that! Heh, heh! Vance told me that he's getting rusty! Nothing has come up in psychology of late, since the Green murder! Yes… I felt rather hurt that you didn't call me on all that Green business! Take off your coats, gentlemen, won't you? I'll get some ice! You see, Mr. Vance, down at Headquarters, … …they've got an idea that I know all about these… – …crimes. – Oh, really? That's right! You and… ahh… …no offense! No! Those killers of his… …at least, the ones I've read about, … …it seems to me, they're all amateurs too! Yes, so they were! That's why Markham thought it might be amusing, … …without disturbing my status as an amateur in the matter, … …for me to… er… meet an authority on the profession! Harry, get some cups! We have coffee. Right! – Won't you sit down, Mr. Vance? – Thank you! Benson, … …did the market hit you? Well, you… you never heard of a bootlegger drinking his own stuff, did you? Strange you two should drop in here this evening, on top of everybody wanting… …to murder everybody else! In the market, of course! Oh! We need another bottle Oh, I'll get it! Oh, here are the keys! And, by the way, be careful of that burglar alarm in the cellar! I think that burglar alarm would interest you, Mr. Vance! Oh? It's a rather tricky arrangement! Later on, I'd like to show it to you. It's not in his room! Must be still in his pocket! I'll get it! – I'll make him give it to me! – Quiet, quiet! Coffee will be ready soon! Darling… – Why can't you get money? – Oh! Does my affection for you mean so little? Oh! These? Well…! …to tell you the truth, darling, … …all that… that glitters, … is not gold! Ooh! My boy! Oh, my boy! But he'll put me in the jail! I tell you, as he hates me! Because of the DelRoy woman! Well, all I did was… …look at her! Can I help it if she loves me? But I am true only to you, my darling, only to you! But this Benson, who calls himself a friend, …! …he's jealous of me! So! To elude me…! …for the jail! I'll…! I'll hate him! We'll…! We'll both hate him! Oh, my boy! Oh, my boy! The most important thing is now to get the envelope, the check, the note! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, you're jelly! That's how they kill in books, Mr. Vance! – But in real life it's really quite different! – I see! Then your thought is, if I had to match wits with a professional, … …I might not have been so lucky, eh? That's it! No, thanks! Oh, I'll get you some coffee in a minute, Mr.Markham! Well, I think this bottle is the last one I bought, Markham! – Before Prohibition! – Oh, that's okay! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh, if you'll excuse me, I'll see what the ladies are doing. It's very interesting to get your point of view, Mr. Vance! Just how would you stack your cards against a professional? Well, it's my theory, Mr. Gray, … …that the only infallible method of determining… …human guilt, … …is by analyzing the psychological factors of a crime, … …and then applying them to the individual! The point is… …in these cases of yours, Vance, … …the gun, … The "gun", that's newspaper slang for "killer", Markham. Right! What I mean to say is, … …these killers you've met… …always used a lot of tricks, Vance! A lot of props! The professionals don't! Oh, from what I hear! They… bang them neat, … …and leave them where they fell. – Exactly! That's one of the reasons they're so seldom caught! In other jurisdictions, I mean! Ha, ha! You mean to tell me that you'd ignore all tangible evidence of a crime? Not ignore it, no! But, … …neither would I accept it for gospel, on its face value! Yes, well… I… I'll make that coffee! Oh! Excuse me! Why don't you go into my room to dry your things? There's a fire there! Thanks! I want that jewel case! – I'll get it, you know! – All right! Later on, when they… when they'll be downstairs. We'll… …talk it over, eh? Will we? I'll be back. Listen! I'm going to get that jewel case! All right! All right! I'll be back! The jury have to depend on circumstantial evidence, Markham! They can't understand any other kind! Well? Is, er…? …Mr. Gray here? He's in the kitchen. Oh! His bag! Will you see that he gets it, please? Certainly! What do you suppose he has…? Oh, this came for you! My bag! Thanks! What did it contain? Pineapples? You know, that's newspaper slang for "bombs", Mr. Gray! – Thanks! – Heh, heh, heh! Getting back to our conversation Vance! How do you think you'd come up with one of these? Banging and leaving after killing, like we were talking about. By a professional, you mean? Exactly! Well, might be rather interesting! Have you anything on that line, Markham? Talk to Gray! Why! I see I have quite a reputation in this town! For the killing! Well, … …perhaps something could be arranged! Splendid! It's Benson! Nothing here! Nor there! Oh! Oohh! Give me the medical examiner's office, please! Somebody must've overheard that conversation of ours! Yes, it's exactly what was occurring to me! I want to see the Dr. Doremus personally! Well, … …there you are, Mr. Vance! Do your stuff! Well, … …that's that! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hurry up with that phone, and give me a match! The first to arrive on the scene was the brains of the Homicide Squad, … …Sergeant "E", for Edward… Ernest! Sergeant Edward Heath, … …or, as I nicknamed him, in one of my more brilliant moments, … …Edward "Sleuth", …! …so as everybody would know he was a detective! Aw, can that stuff! Now, listen, … …whenever I've got a good thing to give you scribes, … …I'll tell you! Yeah? Who's gonna tell you? Anybody could have got up and down those backstairs without being seen! Where is Welch? Up there, over the bedroom! I tended to that! You get outside, look around the grounds! All right! Say, what's ailing you? I got sold out! From the stock market! No! Yeah, I lost 90 bucks! Tch, tch, tch! Wiped out! By the way! Mr. Markham phoned! Mr. Vance will be here right away! Oh, yeah? Well, I'll try and arrange it so that I'll be just gone when… …time he gets here! Hello, Welch! How do you spell "clue"? What difference does it make? There ain't any! Oh, I wouldn't say that, Sergeant! Oohh! Good morning, Sergeant! Why, hello, Mr. Vance! No go, Sam! I'm afraid the blue and that is going to flash! Take that phone in the hall, Welch! Blue, Sergeant, is a very tricky color! You know, in spite of its commonness, it's quite difficult! But that's anomalous, of course! Oh, so it is, so it is! Ahh, … Mr. Vance, … You know, … pardon my obscurity, but sometimes I don't quite follow you! Really, Sergeant? No! Now, a while ago, there, I said there wasn't any clues! And you said that you wouldn't say that! Well, I wouldn't! Really! That was "The Times" calling! They want to know if… You tell "The Times" that when they get my name right, they might get a story! You see, Sergeant, … …I decided to spend the night here, in… …in meditation! So I phoned Sam to bring out my things, and I… …meditated! Any luck? I've been studying that little Derringer that was found at the top of stairs there last night. It's rather unique! Yes, it is! And, of course, the lady's handbag, which you no doubt found in Benson's room there. Yes, I got that right here. Cherchez la femme! Eh, Sergeant? Oui! But I was told to come, by telephone! I was to ask for Mr… Vance! Hey, did you hear that? Well…! You'll go inside! Hey! Is Philo Vance in on this one? – I don't know, is he inside? – I wish I knew! What do you think, Boyd? Come on! Well, I've been here since 6 am! If Vance is here, he is Santa Claus! He must've come down the chimney! One of those two dames owns this bag! Well? Mr. Vance? Oh, yes, come in! You know, Sergeant, when Albert, here, popped in last night, … …Markham thought that he was Gray's man! Gray's… Harry Gray's? Oh, no, sir! As I explained to Mr.Vance, when he called me up this morning, … …Mr. Benson was my employer! He telephoned me last night to bring Mr. Gray's bag from the club! What's your name? Albert… …Brecker. – The medical examiner's here! – Show him up! And you… …stick around! Well, another dizzy dame to do some jury charming, I suppose! I doubt very much, Sergeant, … …whether any woman was in this room with Benson, immediately prior to the murder. And that's what I wanted Albert for, to verify! Good morning, Sergeant! Hiya, Doc! Bless my soul, Mr. Vance! Why, I haven't seen you since we laid the Greene family to rest! – Ha, ha, ha, ha! – Quite right! There was a lovely murder case for you, Sergeant! Bless my soul, yes! I was there! Well, hop at the body, Doc! Certainly, certainly! – Have one of your men give me a hand, please? – Surely! Oh… I… I'm sorry I wasn't here last night! Wedding anniversary! – My wife and I always celebrate! – Uh-huh! Went to a hockey match! How's the election coming? – Bad! – Good! Mr. Benson kept his toupee beautifully, didn't he? He was a bit touchy about himself, if I do say! – Vain, you mean! – Yes, sir! Well, that guy, with the list of phone numbers he had! Whoopsie! Elementary, my dear Albert! Elementary! Sergeant, you've been reading Sherlock Holmes! Quite right, my dear Watson! Quite right! Oh, Welch…! Take care of these, will you? This was Mr. Benson's favorite toupee, sir! Fancy! Oh no, sir! I once worked for a gentleman who had seven! One for every day in the week, to correspond with the natural growth of his hair! Ahh, … Albert, … …do you think that Mr. Benson…? …would have appeared before a lady, in whom he was interested, …? – …without his toupee? – Oh, no, sir! He would rather have died! Well, he got his wish! The Doctor says he was shot at about six feet! And no powder marks! Well, suicide's out! Unless Benson was an acrobat! – If you don't mind, sir… – Of course! Thank you, Albert! I'll see you later! Thank you, sir! You know, Mr. Vance, this is kind of a murder in the public lights! Have you any suggestions? You know, you might have! You were here when it happened! Well, Sergeant, after a night of meditating on what happened before the murder, … …I have suggestions no ends! Oh, Burke's got something out front, Sergeant! Be right now! Oh, Mr. Markham told me about the stuff Harry Gray was saying to you. Like you leading up to the shooting. They're trying to try you out! He's terrible, that gorilla! What's Gray's history? Well, he's suspected of a lot of things! Ever been convicted? Too smart! Just what is his racket? Well, rumor has it that he's the big shot in a bootlegger ring. You know, I still don't like the way he talked to you! Ha, ha, ha! Had to use the kitchen table! Heh, heh! It was about midnight. Direct fire into the heart! A single shot, and never knew what hit him! Tch, tch! Bless my soul, no! Well, he must have seen the guy! Come and have a look at the bullet! Most interesting! I'll be right with you! – Come on, let me… – Never mind, never mind! Sergeant! – Yes? – One of the boys found this in the bushes! – I had it in my hand…! – In your hand! In here, you! – Here! – All right! – Come on, give us a break, let's see it! – Oh, quiet down, will you? What was it? Burke? Ahh… Right here! John? Outside, too! Give me that piece of paper I found in the wooden box. Get that phone! Look at this, Mr. Vance! Yeah, I'll tell him! It's an empty jewel case that we found in a bush outside! Been thrown out of the window. Last night, maybe! And here's the paper it was wrapped in, that I found in the wooden box right there! It's marked, "Mohler". This will interest us later! Yeah, I'll tell him! But Mr. Vance, with the election coming up Tuesday, and the papers riling us the way they are, … …I've gotta have something now! Well, what about that small puddle of blood on the second step from the top, there? – Doesn't it have any particular significance to you? – Oh, Sergeant! They picked up DelRoy down at the Grand Central, trying to beat it out of town! DelRoy! Yeah? Yeah! I'll be right down! Mr. Vance! – Your car is here! – Thank you! Put them together, Welch! Say, Mr. Vance, who did this? The four Marx Brothers! – Oh, Hello, Vance! Glad to see you! – Good morning, Mr.Gray! Anything new? Well, you called my hand last night! Still stuck! I'm, ahh… …afraid I took up that challenge of yours, … …to solve a murder by a professional, too soon! Nah! This was no professional job! Oh, Albert! The door! Thank you! Everybody there, including me, threatened to kill Benson. They were all sore at that financial genius! What's the matter? Albert, get that door! You know, somehow I had the impression that… …er, … Albert was Mr. Benson's man! Ah, so he was! – I just took him on today! – Oh! You see, Benson's dress ties were always tied smart! And Albert, there, was the boy who tied them! – That's it! – I see! Oh, come in, Frank! – Good morning! – Good morning! And those two women that were there last night, Vance? Never get mixed up with women! They're dynamite! – No brains! – Hmm! Shave, sir? Yes! You see, I don't let just anybody put a razor on me! – Neither did Napoleon! – Ha, ha! Yes, I read about that! Ha, ha! – That's where I got the idea! – Oh, Mr. Gray…? I wondered if I could get you to help me out. Sure! I'd better! Or they'll be indicting me again! If everything those birds tried to pin on me stuck, … …I'd have worn-out a carload of electric chairs by now! You see, my business makes me acquainted with a lot of tough mugs! And Markham, and that detective Heath, … …call me in every time an automobile backfires! Aha! But I don't mind! – That's their job! – Yes, so it is! Oh, Mr. Gray, … …something the Police overlooked at the Benson's lodge… …seems to point to one of the guests there last night! And I thought, perhaps you might know someone who… …would look into his room and search it for me. Professionally! You're on to Mohler, hey? Well, … I know a stool pigeon that you might use as a bellhop! Of course, he'd have to have a package of something that he was delivering! In case someone walked in on him! Come on in here! See you, Gray! Oh, you're here! Ah, yes, Sergeant, I'm here! Well, I wasn't but a minute behind you on this one! I'm taking you downtown! Get in there and get ready! – But sir, please! – Get your hat! What's the idea? You too, Gray! Mr. Markham's got some questions he wants to ask both of you boys. All right, just as soon as I'm through here! Didn't I tell you they'd try to pin this on me? Oh, you never killed Benson! Not personally, you didn't! But when I learned that Albert, here, was working for Benson yesterday…! …and for Gray today! Well, …! …I don't have to explain that to you, Mr. Vance! Hurry up, Albert! So! Albert the murderer, and Gray the accessory, huh? Certainly, the rest of our little group won't reject that, will they, Mr. Gray? Hardly! I'm on my way to Knopf, Sergeant! Exhibition of Japanese prints! I'll… see you later, no doubt! – If you'll excuse me! – So long! Hurry up, get him more stuff! All right, the bag's mine! I was in his room then. After climbing in by the back window! Why? – How did you find out? – Well, Harry Gray was present, you know! But Gray has an alibi! He was in the kitchen, making coffee! I see! Harry Gray can't tangle me in this! Why did you try to leave town? Find out…! …if you can! Don't be so picturesque! I'm not a jury! – Oh, you're a fool if you think that I… – Why did you go to the house? To talk to Benson about my account! He sold me out! We quarreled! And you needed money! No! Did you, ahh…? …ever see that before? No! Benson was interested in you! Suppose we say that he attacked you! Well? If you'll excuse me, … …your reputation is well known! The Forsythe suicide, two years ago! – The case that… – Never mind that! I've liked men in my time! They liked me! What of it? I didn't like Tony Benson, but I didn't kill him! If my thoughts could have killed the swine, he'd have been dead long ago! The rest of them are in the reception room there. Wait, please! Sergeant…! – Yes, Chief? – Get Mohler and Mrs. Banning in. Yes, and you'll want that valet of Gray too, when I'm through with him! – You know, Chief, there's something funny… – Never mind that now, Sergeant! DelRoy seemed upset! I don't wonder! You barked at her! You shouldn't bark at the ladies, old man! Oh, I'm busy! This is not the only case in New York! And you're not helping me any! You're more flippant than usual today! Well, this was a particularly flippant murder, Markham! And if you go on trusting clues like those, …! …you will be busier still! Have you a clue? – I have consulted my lawyer… – Sit down! Oh, well… I can't conceive who could have wanted Tony out of the way! Why, we were just planning to go hunting before his month! Oh, you hunt, Mr. Mohler? – He hunts the ladies! – You keep off this! – You will have all… – Do you hunt? Oh, I love to hunt! I love to hunt! – I have a… – Never mind all that! This envelope, with your name on it, was found in Benson's desk! – It contains three very interesting documents! – I said it was useless! He didn't have it with him! The first is a canceled check, of Benson's, made out to Adolph Mohler, … …for $10,000! – Oh…! – The second… …is a confession signed by you, admitting this check to be a forgery! And the third is a note, … …for $10,000, made out to Anthony Benson, … …signed by Adolph Mohler! Yes, yes! Oh, I should have mentioned those things before! You know, my… …financial arrangements were not all… – …what one could desire! – I shouldn't have left you! Unfortunately, to… ahh, … ahh, … …protect Madame's stock, ahh, … ahh, … …Mr. Benson required $10,000! Ah! And you forged his name? Oh, you mean, it would have been a forgery if he had made a complaint! Well, it's a cinch he can't make one now! It's a forgery just the same, Sergeant, we'll take that up later! He forges Benson's name, …! …pays him back with his own money, …! …marvelous! Ahh, … ahh, … I have pleaded to dear old Tony at once, of course, and offered him this note! – Which falls due today! – Yes, and, ahh…! You mean to tell me that… that Benson accepted your note without security? – Oh, well, naturally! – Yeah, well, …? …what was wrapped in this piece of paper… …which was found in the wooden box, with your name on it? Ahh, … ahh, … Tony gave me a party for my birthday! And presented me with a gold pencil! I have it here… – You didn't tell me it was your birthday! – Please, Paula, be quiet! You will get me in the electric chair! – But darling, I… – You will come with me! This is the security that you gave Benson for that note! Oh, ahh, … So Miss DelRoy told you! Who? The jewel case is hers! She wanted it back from Benson! – DelRoy? – Yes! She hates me, that woman! I'm through! I'm finished with her! Now, you are the world to me again, darling! You think I will come to you through your sordid affair? Oh, please! Miss DelRoy loaned me her pearls! What a lovely liar! He bought them for me one day, and stole them the next! So, Adolph, that's what became of the money I sent you to cover my margin! No wonder you forged that check! Why, you… you were speaking in the Benson house last night, both of you! Why did you quarrel with him? I wanted to get back that confession of forgery! He threatened to put Adolph in jail! Mr. Markham, Adolph is all I have now! Except the money that makes him love me! – You threatened to kill Benson yourself, didn't you? – Yes! Well, who didn't? Mr. Markham, …? …may I have that jewel case? – Mr. Gray's here, sir! – Oh, send him in! Miss DelRoy, in the other room. Sergeant! In here, please! – You aren't through with my valet yet? – We are not! Take a seat, Gray! Well, Mr. detective! The newspaper boys are certainly having a lot of fun with you! Being on the scene of the crime last night! Hmm! They don't seem to take your presence at the scene of the murder quite so humorously! No one ever laughs at me! They used to, when I was a kid! But I taught them not to! But you! Philo Vance! The famous amateur detective! To be in on the draw! And then bail out! How do you stand it? Perhaps I haven't completed my draw! Heh, heh! I'll see you later, Gray! Why not? I'm used to that, Markham! Vance, DelRoy is bluffing! Did you know that she didn't even ask if the pearls were still there? No, because she knew they weren't! – Because she got them! – Oh? She tried to leave town, didn't she? – Where was she going, you know? – Yes, Boston! Oh, Vance, I'm tired! I'm tired of all these human passions, and lies, and… You don't suppose they'll beat me at the election Tuesday, do you? Solving this case won't lose you any votes! Well, I haven't solved it! Sergeant! These complications! Mohler…! …and Mrs. Banning, and the rest, manage to obscure the direct evidence against DelRoy! – Yes, Chief? – Sergeant, …! Exhibit A, … …B, and C! Versus Fanny DelRoy! Label them for the Grand Jury! I am going to ask for her indictment this afternoon! On that evidence? Vance, I may not know any Japanese art! But I am still District Attorney of New York! Defense counsel in the McGuire case, sir. He'll have to wait! – Are we to be detained here? – Sergeant! – Yes, sir. – Hand over Miss DelRoy to the custody of a matron! Yes, sir! Hello, … Send Miss O'Brien over to the Chief's office, right away. Yeah! Don't make mistakes, old man! You can't afford to! – If you'll show me where I… – What I'd like to show you… …are some bits of stringy fuzz across the front of Benson's waistcoat! You have that waistcoat, of course! It's in the medical examiner's office. What's that got to do with it? Have I ever let you down? Well, no! Well, suppose we take a look at that waiscoat, eh? All right! – County Coroner! – Yes, sir! Vance, this is like a wild goose chase! Pardon me, Markham, … Ahh, … Suppose you turn into the next corner. Oh! I'm shot, Vance! Stop the car! No, no! My apartment, quick! That shot was meant for me, Markham! Had a silencer on that gun! What makes you think that shot was meant for you? Something I said in your office! – I must have been overheard! – By whom? All the possibilities were there, weren't they? Well, I still think it's DelRoy! But, Markham, … Do women kill merely to recover a string of pearls? Well, suppose Benson had forced his attentions on her! – Suppose that he attempted to… – Can you imagine Benson, with his vanity…? …attempting anything without his… …toupee? – I've got it! – What do you mean? Albert! The minute you told me that Albert brought that handbag out to Gray that night… Gray simply went out there to spend the night with Benson, who was nervous. Well, he picked a swell chaperone! Yeah! Gray forgot and left his bag at Benson's room at the club! Benson phoned, and Albert brought the bag out, that's all! And where did Albert go after that? He claims that he just came back to town! That's no alibi! Why, he only started working for Benson six weeks ago! And when I photographed him, he nearly threw a fit! You know, Markham, because Albert refuses to tell the police the history of his life, … …the Sergeant insists that he's a gunman in disguise! Well, he's a foreigner! Well, my case's against DelRoy! So, Sergeant, you tell the office to prepare the indictment! Yes, sir! Now, just a moment! I'm not going to let you make fools of yourselves Markham, until tomorrow night, let me handle this in my own way! Now, if you don't, … …on the day after tomorrow, … …the morning papers will say that I, not you, …! …will have solved the murder of Anthony Benson, and that's the Election Day! You stopped me last night from proceeding as I saw fit, … …and I got a shot in my arm! – DelRoy had the real motive! – Oohh, motive! Drop a nickel in the slot, and get a motive! Everybody has some motive for murdering somebody! Better be careful someone doesn't murder you! No, nobody's gonna get him, Chief! I'll watch over you, Mr. Vance! Thank you, Sergeant! Oh, … tell me, did that firearms expert of yours say when he would know all about those bullets? – Ahh, … sometime today. – I'll see him! And if you don't mind, Markham, I'd like to have Miss DelRoy's jewel case… – …brought to me here, this afternoon! – Right! Then, I want a policewoman! – A policewoman! – Yes! Say, I can handle anything in this case! Well, very good, Sergeant! This is a little job of chambermaiding, in a hotel! Oh! Huh! This is the bullet that killed Benson. The rifling marks on it correspond exactly… …with the rifling on the inside of the barrel of that gun you picked up after the murder. This one is the one that hit Mr. Markham. The same kind of a bullet, fired from the same kind of a gun! But the trouble is, that this is such a special make…! …that I don't understand how there can be two of them, exactly alike, around here! – Excuse me, Mr. Vance! – Yes, Welch? – Here's the picture of those fingerprints you wanted. – Oh, good! And, … that coffee can. You left it there all right? – Yes, I stuck it back on the kitchen shelf! – Thank you! What gets me is, Sergeant Heath said there was no explosion when Markham was shot! Now, this type of gun was designed in Russia, during the Revolution, … …for the protection of the women of the aristocracy. A few, taken to Paris, were copied for the underworld! But there was never a silencer manufactured for that gun! Ah, but there was, Captain! In this article, by the latest mail of the Paris police, … …both the gun and its tiny silencer are described. You might keep that copy for your files. – Thank you. – Thank you! And, … Captain, if there should be a call for me, I'll be at the reference room, at "The Times". I'll let you know! – Goodbye! – Goodbye! But for breadth of composition, Mr. Vance, … – …and for unusual delicacy of line, I would… – Oh, Sam! Pardon me, … – Yes, sir? – Is Mr. Markham all right? Well, no, sir. Sergeant Heath is with him. If anything, Mr. Vance, I could do no better than to recommend to you… …these three very choice examples of the Ukiyo-e school. Now, these, Mr.Vance, are a rare opportunity! If you don't take advantage of it, sir, I assure you, you'll regret it! Hey! Hey! Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? Oh, pardon me, Sergeant! This is my print dealer. He's not dangerous! Ooh! If you would step aside, please! Mr. Vance… I'm gonna take that door, Mr. Vance! You know, we can't be too careful today! All right, Sergeant! Oh, by the way…! You haven't forgotten that jewel case, have you? Right here! Thank you! Of course, Mr.Vance, … I don't want to force these upon you! I have in the portfolio something that might interest you still more. If I can only find it here… It's something I was particularly anxious to bring to your attention. Ah, yes, here we have it! These three, from the Wright collection: Hokusai, … …Narunobi, and Hiroshige, Mr. Vance. These, as you know, are very difficult to get! Ahh… – Oh, Burke! Did you get it? – Yes, sir. All the sacks were tied up with… with cord, like that. Except one! And that one? Well, somebody must have cut it off, like you said! – Hey, what have you been up to? – All right, Sergeant, I'll explain later! Oh, Burke, …? Will you stand by at Mr. Markham's office, please? Yes, sir! Sergeant, … …we're getting warm! What do you mean, we're getting warm? From that? Mr. Vance, may I not call your attention to these very… Oh, ahh, … I'll take the Hiroshige. – Three thousand, you said, eh? – Right, thank you! Correct! Pardon me. Three thousand bucks for those chromos?? What's the psychology in that, Mr. Vance? Sergeant, we're hot! Then would you please let me in on this string bonfire business? You'll observe, Sergeant, this twine burns! Slowly, but surely! Oh, will you take that, please? Yeah? No, Heath! Oh, she has! Good! – Yes, Sergeant? – Mrs. Banning confessed! Slowly, … …but surely! It was to protect Adolph! I went to Benson's room, I pleaded with him! He had the jewel case, … …so I thought he must have Adolph's confession of forgery, … …and his note, too! Benson laughed at me! There was a gun on the table, … …so I… …I shot him! He went to the door to call, … …and then, … he fell! And where was Mr. Mohler? In one of the guest rooms! Oh, I swear to you, Mr. Mohler is innocent! Now, Mrs. Banning, … Yes? Have you a hairpin? Uh? A hairpin! Why! Yes! May I have it? Thank you! Sergeant Heath's on the wire, Mr. Vance. – Is there anyone in the reception room? – No, sir. I'll take it there. Hello! Yes… Oh, just a minute! What are you doing up? You think I can lay around your apartment, with the newspapers hounding me about this Benson crime? Where's Sergeant Heath? I can't find him anywhere! I have him on the wire! He's doing something for me. Oh! Also for you! Oh? Yes, Sergeant! Yes. All right! Arrange it for… …6 sharp! And you'd better adjust that clock out there, and your watch, with mine. I make it just 4:33. Right! Er… Mr. Vance, if you're through with me, ah…? – Ah, … well, I haven't led any lunch yet, and I… – Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Burke, ! Suppose you eat first, … …and then pick up that policewoman who is chambermaiding for us at that hotel, will you? – All right! – Good! What do you think of her confession? Well, more a confession of love than a confession of guilt, don't you think? – You mean that she's trying to protect Mohler? – Well, what else? Oh! – Mr.Gray's here, sir! – Let him in! How do you do! – Oh, hello! – How are you, Gray? Hey, when are you gonna play that hand you've been bragging about? Tonight! Would you like to, ah… sit in on the game? Table stakes? Anything you say! No, you say! This'll be your party! I don't think so! Markham, I'd like to have all our little group at Benson's lodge, in one hour. And, … suppose we take along a photograph of Adolph Mohler's fingerprints. I understand, Vance, I know what you think, yes. Mohler, … …you mean to tell me that you were just sitting up there, alone…? …when the gun went off? How do you know he wasn't in a closet? Oh, this is going to be an interesting hand! Well? What I said was, that I was not with Mrs. Banning! I don't want to know where you were not! I want to know where you were! I'm a gentleman! Oh, … Miss DelRoy? Yes. He was with me! Remarkable fellow, Mohler! Oh, come on! We're not getting any place at all, Vance! You'll have your murderer, Markham, by six o'clock! I can't stand much more of this! If you've got anything on me, say it! Ahh, … This is a rather unusual jewel case of yours, Miss DelRoy. Oh, but you…! You know, Markham, …! …Miss DelRoy had a better motive, for keeping Anthony Benson permanently quiet, than any of them! Please! – I would like to go! – You'll keep quiet! And you, Albert, hiding your facts from the police! – I was afraid! – I don't blame you! Albert's wife is looking for him! He left her in Chicago recently, without giving notice, you might say! How much longer this comedy will last, Vance? In 10 minutes, Markham, ut won't be comedy! For one of you, …! …it isn't now! Is it? But why give me a ringside seat to the séance? If any of you comics have got an idea that I had anybody bump Benson off… You certainly had motive enough, didn't you? What motive? A simple matter-of-fact revenge for having sold you out on the market! You, the illustrious Harry Gray! The big shot! Vanity and arrogance, Markham, … …usually motivate the behavior of the intelligent gunman. Gunman? Look here! But you were with us, here, … …when the shot was fired, and the body fell! And, … just before that? I was in the kitchen, making coffee! That's right, I remember! I remember that it was very overboiled, the coffee! It must've been on the fire a long time wasn't it? Gray…? Gray couldn't have made the coffee that night! I made it for Paula! I wouldn't call me a liar, if I were you! Hey, I was proud I made the coffee! And if Mohler did make it, Markham, Mr. Gray was out of this room some five minutes! And doing what? You're dealing! Don't ask me! I'm not! I'm telling you! Mr. Gray didn't make the coffee that night, you know! Who says I didn't? This photograph, …! …of the only fingerprints on that specially unwrapped can of coffee, …! …and this one, of your friend Mohler, … …prove – even to a jury, Markham –… – …that only he touched that coffee can! – Oh, sorry! When they took the prints of my finger this afternoon, I knew you had suspected! If you are going to accuse me, do it! Oh, this is getting tricky! Oh, two-handed poker isn't so very tricky, do you think? Mr. Gray, …? …just what were you doing while Markham and I sat here that night, …? …and Albert came in so mysteriously, with your handbag? You tell me! Tcha! You crept up those backstairs, … …tapped on Bensons's door. He was changing his collar. You remember, Markham, how it bothered him? Walked in, and shot him dead! With one of those imported Derringers and silences of yours! Silencers? Ha! That's a hot one! You heard the shot, …! …while I stood here with you! The shot that killed Benson was silent! No one heard it! Just as no one heard the shot which you fired at me, Gray, and which wounded Mr. Markham! Here at the lodge, however, … …you arranged for a second shot to explode, as Benson's body came tumbling down those stairs! Ha! Oh, and I suppose the body waited up there for the second shot? Exactly! You arranged that too! Just as I have! Oh! It's a dummy! – Oh, Burke, … – Yes, sir! Supported at the head of the stairs by a piece of twine, … …of the same kind that Mr. Gray cut from a sack of liquor in the basement, that night! The twine was crossed around Benson's body, and looped around a newel post at the head of stairs! I knew that the body must have been there for several minutes! How did you know? Because, if Benson had been shot immediately prior to his fall… …down the stairs, … …there couldn't possibly have been that puddle of blood on the second step from the top! Could it? Very interesting! But where were all these people while I was doing this Houdini stuff? Do you think I'd take a chance of being walked in on, like that? But what chance were you taking, after you saw that Mrs. Banning was resting…? …on the bed, in her room? How did you know that? Your hairpin, Mrs. Banning! Thank you! It exactly matches… …this one, …! …which I found on your pillow up there, that night! From the impression of your figure on the bed, you must have been resting there for some time, weren't you? Yes! – I was lying there for YYYY! – Ahh! All right! But what about DelRoy, and Mohler? Miss DelRoy has already told us that Mohler was with her. Discussing a… …a pearl, I should think! Mr. Mohler had considerable explaining to do, if you remember! You listened outside their door! And what you heard convinced you that they would remain there for several minutes at least! But how could he have timed the shot? As I just did with the dummy! That's another of Benson's cartridge burglar alarms, like this one! You used the one Benson had stuck in the door of his store room! You got it when you went down to the cellar that night! After you'd made sure that you would not be interrupted by Mrs. Banning and the others, … …you hung the body and the alarm on that twine up there! Then you set fire to a loose end of the twine, … …so that when the flame reached the knot, … The twine broke, the body fell, … …and the alarm dropped to the floor, where it exploded, like this! You were first upstairs after the body fell! You quickly dropped the Derringer behind the newel post, … …picked up the alarm and the string, … …put them in your pocket, … …and, … …told me to… … "do my stuff", wasn't it? Well, … He meant to kill Benson, you see, but… …surrounding it with the props, as he did, was simply… …camouflage, I suppose, to, ahh, … befuddle the amateur? You're going to have the time of your sweet life trying to hang this on me! The policewoman I used as a chambermaid in your hotel… …has already hung it on you! She found Miss DelRoy's pearls, … …which you stole that night, … …after the shooting, to divert suspicion! Anything else? Oh, yes! The coat you wore, Mr. Gray! It seems that bits of fuzz from the twine you used… …were on Benson's waistcoat! Also, … …on the inside of this pocket. The same pocket from which I saw you withdrawing your hand, as I followed you up the stairs! You know that isn't enough! Do you think any jury would go for that? Well, if not, … …I know they'll go for this! A clever little silencer, that fits your clever little gun! Another trophy from your room, Mr. Gray! Also contributed by our policewoman! Is that enough? All right! You outsmarted me, Vance! I'm game! Hey! – Beware, he's got a gun! – Oohh! Drop it, Gray! Well, Mr. Vance, … …I told I'd watch over you! Thank you, Sergeant! That baby put three slugs mighty close to me! I'd better call a doc! My love, I'll wait outside! – Haven't been feeling all right! – I'll take care of you, Dolphy dear! Burke! – Get that coat and cover him! – Yes, sir! That you, Doc? This is Sergeant Heath! I'm out at the Benson lodge! There's been another murder! I mean, ahh, … …shooting! I did it! Okay! Mr. Vance, … …may I have the jewel case now? Oh, of course! And, … don't worry! No one else knows about… – …your daughter! – Thank you! I was going to her… …when they caught me leaving town! If Benson had found it, he would have held it over me! Threatened…! …to tell my little daughter… …what I am! Thank you, Mr. Vance, … …for not telling them about that! So, it was Harry Gray, Mr. Vance! Well, …! …it didn't surprise me any! Heh, heh, heh!
