Isn't that right, Ben? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Um, Ben, maybe you could teach Jem and her siblings how to fish. - Oh, yeah, Ben loves fishing. - I know how to fish. - Um, oh, I was hoping to catch your eldest tonight.

He has a few words. Let's listen. - He's back from King's Valley. - What's King's Valley? - It's this kind of camp where the Lord works on you. - Yeah, where you do hard labor and sleep in the dirt. - Hey. - T--today, I speak to you all a cleansed man. A few months ago, I turned away from God. I now know how lost I was, and I reject that sinful life. I ask God for His forgiveness and for yours. May I be pliable clay in the potter's hand... And permit You to shape me into the person that You would have me be. - Amen. - Amen. - I just can't believe Edmond's back. Do you know what he did? - He was watching porn on Dad's computer. - Watching what? - He's all quiet now. - Yeah, well, he got whupped real good there. I mean, did you see his hand? - That's why you got to be so careful with technology. It's the easiest way for Satan to reach you. - Plenty of easier ways. Hi, guys. Real happy to see y'all. Hopefully, you won't miss my dad too much. - How was Puerto Rico? - Hey, bro. - Yeah, how was it being gone for so long? - Oh, man. It was incredible. Yeah, it's beautiful, and the people from my church were all amazing. Got real into farming. Got myself a little green thumb. So... some parts of service were a little intense, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. What I ask of you guys is that... we don't judge him too harshly. Because all of us have done things that we're ashamed of, right? I had-- I had a plan for today, but I'm thinking, let's, uh-- maybe we should change it up. Let's all stand. And let's get on the ground. Move the chairs to the wall. - What's with him? - I don't know. Let's see. - Can you spit that out, please? Alright. Find a little special space for yourself on the ground. Everyone, lay down. Get down on the ground. There we go. It's just-- it's just linoleum tiles. Lie all way down. Yep, just like you're in bed sleeping. There we go. All the way. There we go. Yep. Eyes closed. And put your hands on your belly. Just feel the ground underneath you, holding you up. - Do you want us to pray? - If you want. We all share this ground that God gave us. God is giving us the gift of others who can share our burdens and whose burdens we share. - What was that? - I don't know, but Puerto Rico made him weird. - Remember when you said if you were a boy, you wanted to look like Owen? - Becca. - What? You said it. - No dance troupe this week. - Yeah, I heard she had the baby. - No, Mrs. Baker decided she can't do it anymore at all. - Wait, really? So it's just no more? - We don't know. - Why don't we just find someone else to teach it? - Y'all, my mom said Owen's in charge of church programs. Maybe we could just ask him if we could still do it. - Oh, man, yeah! Let's. - I think Kelsey should choreograph. - Oh, no. - You should! You'd be good at it. - You think so? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, I was just delivering some eggs to Mr. Garson. I guess I got turned around. - Three houses down that way. - Right. Heard you're in charge of programs. Some of us were thinking we could maybe still do the dance troupe without Mrs. Baker. - Yeah, I could try and find someone else to teach it. - How long would that take? - Uh, I don't know. It ain't my expertise. - It's just, we usually do something for Labor Day, so we need some time to put it together. - It'll happen when it happens. - Maybe we could do it ourselves. - I'm sorry. My answer's no. - I liked that thing we did yesterday on the ground. - Nice try. - For real. I...thought it was cool. - Yeah, well, I reckon I freaked everyone else out. - Maybe. - Yeah. It was an exercise one of the pastors in Puerto Rico had us do, but it doesn't translate here, I guess. - I don't know. I like changing it up. - Since the secret's out with you. My wife would kill me. - What if we got one of the older women to sign off on everything? Make sure the moves are worshipful, God-focused? - Uh... bunch of teen girls coming up with their own dance? You know how much grief I'd get? - You'd freak everyone out. Alright. So who'd be in charge? - Well, I've been in the troupe for a while. - Alright. Yeah. Your dad's got to be cool with it. Okay. - Your shoe. - Oh. - Just-- Thanks. - Sarah! I'm in charge of dance troupe. Did you hear that? Okay, fine! - Wait, wait, stop! No, no! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Is he okay? - Just leave him be. - What happened? - Someone he used to play music with died. Walt. They were real close. - Never heard of him. - Well, it's before your time. Before I met your dad, before he got clean. - How'd he die? - He, um... took his own life. He was a troubled man. What's this I hear about dance troupe? - Oh. Owen Taylor asked me to be in charge of it. - Huh. - It's only 'cause Mrs. Baker can't do it, but he thinks I'm kind of good at it, so... - Is this for God or for vanity? - It's to praise God. - Can't interfere with home duties. - It wouldn't. - I'll talk to your dad. - Y'all have fun today? - Yeah, sure did. - Kelsey, you're the car pool queen today? Alright, drive safe. - Yep. - How'd I do today? - Slightly better. Hey, um, I just realized I have a flat tire, and I was wondering if I could get a ride. - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - I'll put the seat down. - Oh, sorry. It's for a Daniel fast. You ever done one? - No. I like Mexican food too much. - Mexican food. Now I'm hungry. - Is that Puerto Rico? - Yeah. Here, look. At this beach, you stick your head underwater and you can hear the dolphins clicking and whistling. Wild. - It looks fake. - I know, right? This is the, uh-- this is the church's farm, which I managed. Anyway. - Why don't you go back? - Not the time. That and Misty would wring my neck. - You should start a farm here. - Hmm. - I'm serious. - Yeah, I bet you are. So, uh, any cool new dance ideas? - Um, I don't know yet. I want to do something cool for Labor Day, but... - You should look online for inspiration. There's tons of cool worship dance videos. - Yeah. - Why were you crying that night? At the ball? - I wasn't being mindful. - Well. I'm sure that ain't true. Okay. - Could you, um, show me one of those dance videos? - Uh, yeah, sure. Wow. They look so good. - Are you chewing gum? - No. - Spit it out. - Spit it out. - Jem? - I had a flat tire. - Oh. - Uh, I hope you apologized for imposing. - Oh, it's really no problem. - Jem, inside. Gotta give Becca her history test. - Thank you. - Owen, say hi to your mom for me. - Yeah, will do. - "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, "but not love, I've become a sounding brass or a clanging cymbal." - It means even if you have the most beautiful gifts, it doesn't matter if you don't have love in your heart. - Jem Starling. Come here. Please? Sit. - Something wrong? - No, no. Uh... - Ben Taylor asked your dad about courting you. - Oh. - Dad prayed on it, and... he feels that this is the path God wants for us. - Yeah. He's leading you to fulfill your purpose. - We're so blessed to bring our families together. - I never really talk to Ben. - Well, you'll get to know him. - It's just before, you said I didn't have to-- - I thought you were excited to start down this path. - I am. I'm--I'm just surprised. - Proverbs 3:5, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart." - Um... Can I pray on it? I need to lie down. - Alright, you guys! We're going to meet back here in an hour and 45 minutes! Don't lose sight of your buddy! Buddy system works for a reason! What do you want to play, Ben? - Fuck you! - Those are your-- those are your words, Misty. Misty, I--I can't talk to you right now, alright? It's just feeling-- it's too loud in here. I can't even hear you. I'll call you later. Eavesdropping, huh? - I don't care about your phone calls. - Ooh, ooh! - Yeah! - Here. One, two-- - Hey! - Alright, ball. Oh! Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Alright, well, you're all warmed up already. - Don't burn it. - I like it burned. Is this all the firewood you got for the whole night? - Yeah. - Okay. We're gonna need a little more wood than that. Here. - Gotta pee. Need help? - Sure. - It's a fun night. - Yeah, I like when church is like this, not getting all hung up on doctrine. - Yeah, totally. - Dancing is allowed, though. You ever wanna be a pro dancer? - No. - Why not? That's the stick you're gonna choose? - I'm gonna have to find a new helper. - You know, the-- that's something I struggle with. Sometimes I worry I'm... enjoying it too much for myself and like I'm doing it for vanity and not to praise Him. - What, you think God will strike you dead if you're enjoying dancing? - I mean... - You're experiencing joy in His creation, you know? And that's-- that's honoring Him. - Well, either way, my mom would kill me. And anybody can do what we do. I ain't like a real dancer. - Yeah, right. I've seen you. Here. Show me something. - No. - Come on. If anybody can do it. - No. - Come on. - I'm not-- - Got your own stage right here. - What? - Come on. I'm serious. Put that wood down. - Here, I'll take those. Bug on you. Sorry. Uh... better get back. - Anybody else want some? - Hey. How was it? - It was good. Lord, I come before you, humbled and ashamed. Satan tried to take a hold, but I'm pushing him out. I know I've given in to lustful thoughts and actions that take my focus away from You and onto me. I know that's wrong. I'm going to keep You at the center of my thoughts and actions. Amen. - Thank you, Jemima. Courtship... is a commitment made for the purpose of getting to know each other better and seeking God with the aim of marriage. Romans 12:13 says, "Let love not be deceit. "Abhor all that that is sinful and cleave to that which is good." - You ever think about preaching? - Mm. Maybe. - It's cool that your brother... preached in another country. It'd be cool to go to, like, South America or something. - Lotta rape there. - Oh. - My friend Simon has chickens. - One time, this one chicken was like-- Just wouldn't stop pooping. It was like this brown and white, just kind of foamy liquid kept coming out and coming out everywhere it walked. It was so funny. And it got on all the other chickens, too. Want to barf. - It was probably sick. - ♪ I just know I was destined to be something more ♪ ♪ I was born with an ace up my sleeve ♪ What do you want? - Nothing. - Oh. Hey, come on back. Sorry, sorry. Come on back. It's okay. Come on. Hey. Sorry. - What was that? - You don't recognize me? - That was you? - Mm. - I didn't know you played music like that. - Yeah, yeah. Played a little secular music. It was a long, long time ago. - With the man who died? - Yeah, we used to write some songs together. You excited about your courtship? - Yeah. - Yeah, right. Do not tell your mama. Shh. - Hey, walk like a lady. You slump like your dad. - Is he bad again? Mom. - Sometimes Satan tries to take hold. He's okay. - Are you going to tell Pastor Taylor? - Ah, that's murder. It's not like the last time. He just needed to unwind. - But what--what if it-- - Look, he's fine. Okay? I'm not dwelling on this with you. Got plenty of other things to concern yourself with. - ♪ Lord of Lords, King of Kings ♪ ♪ My God, how can I have no song but Thee? ♪ Oh. - I'm sorry. - I'll take this one.

Can't wait to see what you're going to do for Labor Day. - Yeah, it'll be good, I think. - Gosh, it's been so long since I've seen a dance show. - There's much dance in Puerto Rico. - When would I have seen it? - Jem is lovely to watch. - Thanks. - Welcome. - Hey, Owen. - Yeah. - Can I speak to you for a sec? - Yeah. - Oh, Jem, you're a youth grouper-- you don't want to work on some old farm, right? - Um, I don't know. - Oh, you see?

Unless you want noodles. - What? - You want noodles? - You're here late. - Congratulations on your courtship. - Thanks. - How's dance? - Fine. Well, a lot of the girls don't like my ideas. Is that why you were praying? Kidding. Who cares what they want, you know? Just do your thing. - I don't know. - Sure you do. - Hot. - You like seashells? I was clearing this out today.

No, I got the van. - No! - Can you tell me the first ten books? - Mom, when's dinner gonna be ready? - I don't know. Not happy with you. - I'm sorry. - She threw up. Can you please give her a bath? - Okay, Jeremy, I'm sorry, honey. But unless you want to go in your room, if you want to be out here by the TV, then it's gonna be loud. - When is it ever gonna be ready? - I have no idea, Rebecca. Can you salt the water, please? - How many of y'all know that if you met God in the next 60 seconds, that you'd be ready? That you could say, "I'm good, Pastor Taylor. I'm saved. My sins are forgiven"? Raise your hand up there. To the heavens. Come on now. Now, those of you who couldn't assuredly raise your hand up, you got some hesitations, some lingering doubts. Who'd say, "If I died and met God, "I don't rightly know if my sins would be forgiven, but I know I don't want to go to hell"? I invite you to come up to this altar for your sins and for your soul's salvation. Please, come on up right now. Come on up, come on up. It's a short walk. Jesus died on the cross for you! Jesus! That's right! That's right! Here we go, here we go! Praise God, praise Jesus! That's right. Strength of God. - Round, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. Duh, duh, push and down. Step together.

Do you feel guilty? - Uh... I mean, yeah. I don't know. A lot before. Less now. - Why? - I don't know. I've been praying on it a lot, and I just-- maybe I'm crazy, but it just-- it don't feel like a sin. Swear as the sky covers me, it don't. - But you're-- you're married. - Yeah, and we can't stand each other. We can't. I mean, she's all, like, gossip and babies, and I'm-- we ain't never felt connected, ever. We misread the signs. I know it. But with you, I just--you know, I see so much for you. And when I'm with you, I want so much for me, too. I ain't never felt that with anybody. How could God not want that? But if you want to stop, I more than get it, completely. Let's stop. - I don't. - It's really okay if you do. - I--I feel it, too. "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I am nothing." Is it possible to love too much? All I feel is Your love, Lord. The most beautiful gift You've given to us, that draws us even closer to You. So I want a heart full of love. I want it to fill me to the brim. - Hey, if there's anywhere you could live, where would it be? Anywhere? - Mm. I'm not sure. - Come on. If you could go literally anywhere in the world outside of Kentucky. - I'm not sure. I don't know. - So what, are you just going to stay here? There's a whole lot more, let me tell you. - I like the skies and the trees, and my dance troupe, and my siblings. What? - You just don't know what you're talking about. - Hey. Did I wake you? - Um, I was just getting some water. You're a baby. Come fly with me. - What was the name of your band? - Deadbeats. - Were you famous? Mm, we got around. We had a record deal. We had a residency at Arleen's. - What's that? - Arleen's? In Memphis. Everybody played there. You wouldn't know it from seeing it, but all kinds of legends came through, and that was my favorite spot to play. - Why'd you leave? - After I got saved, I didn't want to be selfish no more. Everything was always about me, my songs, my struggles. - Do you miss it? When God asks you to give something up, it's just so you got more room for Him. Go to sleep. - Oh--here, let me help you. - I got it. - There you go. There you go. You okay? - Okay. - I don't get a fancy touch one? - Mm-mm. - Do you want to... meet tonight? - My parents are coming over for dinner tonight, so probably not the best night. It's okay. Nobody died. - Hey, y'all. - Hey. Here you go. And you know how to put those things of CDs in there. And, uh, yeah, Misty's going to sit in on your, uh-- your Labor Day choreography. - Sure am. - Yup. So. - I can't wait. - Yep. - Thank you. - Yeah. - She's just the sweetest girl. - I know. She'll be good. - ♪ Fire in me ♪ ♪ You are the fire in me ♪ ♪ Heavenly Father ♪ ♪ You are the fire in me ♪ ♪ You are the fire in me ♪ That was real nice, girls! Thanks. So reckon there's just a couple of things in there we got to correct. - Really? - Yeah, just a few. - Like what? - Well, there are some moves in there where I'm worried they focus a little too much on the individual. So let's go through it without music and make some adjustments. - Okay, we'll just go from the elbow bit. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Stop a sec. I know you didn't mean to draw attention to your legs. Let's do the turn without the leg, okay? Let's see it. - Okay, we'll just do that turn bit and keep your leg in. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Yeah. Keep going. Keep going. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six-- - And stop. Again, a little too individual-focused. Don't you think? - Why? - Well, you're the only one standing right now. All eyes are on you. - But my attention's to God. - Yes. But it almost looks like all these girls are worshipping you. - That's what I was saying. - I know that's not what you were intending. Of course. So let's make it so everyone stands together. Okay? What's the matter? - I just... we're praising God, and if you take this whole thing apart, you're just ruining this worship. - Listen. I reckon you're making this about you, and it's not about that. - She's used to being Owen's favorite and doing what she wants. That's not true. - You got to choreograph. - We barely even talk. I'm just trying to do a good job. - Alright. Uh, Jem... Will you please just be a grownup and work with me on this? - Okay. I'll kneel down like all of you guys. - Thank you. You can take it from the top. - Girls, I'll be right back, okay? Paul, where have you been? - Hmm? - You got off work six and a half hours ago. Five-hour-long way home? - Uh-huh. - And you haven't been answering your phone. - Frank let me go. And it's--it's-- that we just have to figure out. - He let you go? I don't understand. You've been there for eight years, and he just let you go? Nothing happened? Paul, give me your keys. Just give me your keys. - Leave me alone. - We've got to talk to Pastor Taylor about this. - I am tired! Leave me alone! - Are you sure you don't want your dad to stay? I wouldn't particularly mind. - No, it's okay. - Okay. We'll be back late afternoon. Rest up. Boys, come on. Let's go. Everybody else is already in the car. - Alright. - Thank you. - Come on. Did you scratch Misty's car? Jem, you can't do that! She told me what happened at rehearsal. I had to talk her down from calling your folks! - She was trying to take over. - That doesn't matter! It's on the road to giving us away! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Just trying to figure this out for us, alright? You're getting jealous. - You really don't want to be with her? - No. - It's unbiblical to divorce. Owen. - Not if God never wanted us to be together. You're getting bold, little wolf. Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! Back here. To the right! Through here! Stay here. Okay? Hey! Hey, you. - I got sick. Threw up all over Mona's car. - Oh, no! - Poor thing. We gotta pay for it. Maybe it's something I ate. - Hmm. Yeah. Wait, wait, don't... - What? - Nothing. - I'm so sorry, baby. - I think that's it for now. We're out of Pepto. Will you get me some? - Yeah. Yeah. You bet. Let's get you into bed. - I need Pepto. - Okay. Wait till I come get you. - Just a sec! Oh, my goodness! The Starling girls? What a surprise! - We brought cookies. - Well, that is just so thoughtful! My tummy is being a little squirrelly, but I bet Owen will love them. Girls, why don't you come inside for a bit and cool off? I've got some lemonade in here. Get some lemonade fixed for you. - Where've you been? - I needed some air, so I went out, and I fell asleep in the grass. - You felt good enough to ride bikes today, huh? - Well, yeah, I was just-- - And you just fell asleep? - Huh? - You think I'm dumb? - Why-- why would I think that? - You're done dancing. - What? Dad. - You flat-out lied to my face. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. - Dad, come on. - I can't have you pursuing a life of self-centeredness, Jem. - Dad, I've put-- I've put time into this. You can't just take me out of it. - This is better for you. Trust me. - Our dance is in a few days. You can't take this away from me! - Enough of the back talk! - You lie, too! - What were you doing there? - It was crazy-- - Don't lie. I'm not asleep when you leave. - I know what it looks like. But Owen and I-- we've been praying on it a lot. And we're gonna figure it out. - Figure out what? - We're meant to be together. God wants us to be together. - That doesn't make any sense. - Becca. Becca, we prayed on it, and we know. And I promise you. I promise you, it's gonna be okay. But you cannot tell anyone right now. Okay? Please. Please. Rebecca, please. Just not right now. Becca, look at me. - I told you to wait. That was so stupid. - You left me for hours. - I had to go to three different places. Alright? She could have seen you. - Well, my dad knows I lied, and I have to quit the troupe. - I'm sorry. Hey. I'm sorry, it's just-- it got so messed up, and I... - I have to tell you something. Rebecca saw me. - What? - She brought y'all food, and she saw me climb out the window. And... she knows. - What do you mean she knows? - Well, I had to tell her. - You didn't have to tell her anything. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. - Owen. - Oh, no. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. - Maybe it's God. Maybe now it's time. - For what? - To tell everyone. - What? No. - Why not? - You--you don't understand. It's not-- - No, I do understand. - I just need-- I just need a minute to think, okay? Okay. So... Jem... I reckon we should stop, just for a little while. - What? - Yeah, I just need some time to think, and just reckon it would be better to be delicate. - I--what-- what do you mean? - I mean, let's pray on this. - No, I don't wanna stop. - Just for a little while. Okay? - Owen. No, no, no, no, no. - Just for a little while. - I don't-- - I really gotta get back, Jem. I really gotta get back. - Owen, I don't wanna stop. - I gotta get back. We'll talk more soon, okay? We'll talk more soon. Okay? Okay? Jem! I gotta get back! We'll talk more soon, alright? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Hey, Jem. Hey. - Uh, Dad. - I'm sorry about the other day. - Dad? Dad. Dad. Dad! - Hey, hey, Paul? Paul, hey, hey. What'd you take? - What happened? - Did you take something? - Paul. Hey, come on. Let's get him up. Get him up. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Hey, Jem, go call 911. - Is he dying? - You're okay, Dad. - Just go. Now. - You're okay. - Okay. - You're okay. They don't know if-- if he's gonna wake up. He took some of my pills. And they think he accidentally took too many. Gotta get back to the hospital and relieve Noah. - Mom, it wasn't an accident. - Oh, Jem. - It wasn't. - Shut up! I'm going back to the hospital. Don't say anything to them. You take them to that cookout, and you pretend like everything is normal. - No! No! - Stop being selfish!

Come on, let's go back! - Let go of me! - Let's go back! - Let me-- - No, we're going back! Come on! Let's go back! We're going back! - Stop! - Please, don't-- You psycho! - Where is everyone? - Mrs. Stone's house. - Is it Dad? - Pastor Taylor called about Ben-- on top of everything else-- and I said that must have been some kind of joke. She wouldn't do that. And then I found this. It's Owen Taylor's number, right? What did you do with him? Tell me. Did you have sex with him? I feel like I don't know you. You're--you're ruined. - We're connected. It's God's plan. - What was that? Did you--does your dad know about this? Was it 'cause of you? - No. - Was it? - I--no-- - Every word out of your mouth is Satan flapping your tongue. He's sifted you like wheat! - I'm sorry! Mom! Mom! Mom! Please! Mom, I'm sorry! - You should get cleaned up. This is a trying time. And there's no denying, given my sons are involved, the personal, sensitive nature of this. I need to, uh-- I need to discuss some things with you. - Okay. - Before Owen, did you have impure thoughts? Did you feel overtaken by them? - I don't know. - When did this thing with Owen begin? And... whose idea was it? Who started it? - Where is Owen? - I don't know. Why would you ask? - He and I talked about it. And if we could just explain-- - Explain what? - That we--we're meant to be together. - Stop it. - Woah, enough, alright. You've let Satan into your heart. - I haven't. - No, you have. Why do you think you're hurting the people that love you? Listen. If you think that God wanted you and Owen to be together, how are you so certain that wasn't Satan whispering into your ear? - If you'd just get Owen here-- - Owen doesn't want to talk to you. His life is ruined. He's got to give up his position. Misty wants to leave him. - Your son had a big part in that. - Certainly, but, uh... but he says that Jem brought him to sin. He says that she inhibited his ability to control himself. Jem, is any of that true? I mean, I ain't saying that he ain't at fault, okay? That's clear. He is. But we're here, and we're talking to you about this. And it is clear to me that Satan has got his hold on you. This-- this is a spiritual attack. You've tumbled down a very dark hole, Jem. I tell you something, though. We can still save you. God is our strength, our victory over Satan. Do you want to be saved? - Yes. - I tell you, I think this family needs a big reset. Alright? And I think the best thing for everyone is for you to go away for a little while. Now, your mother and I have-- we discussed it, and we decided that it's best for you to spend time at King's Valley. - Please, no. - Your father and I've let y'all down. I won't make that mistake again. - Please, Mom. Please. - You gotta do this. Or you can't be part of this family. I just-- I can't have that influence on your siblings. - We have an incident to bring to you all today. Someone who would like to talk to everyone. Jem. Jem Starling needs our help. So we're gonna help her, right? Yes, sir. - Alright. Come on. Jem. - To my fellow congregants, I-- I come before you, humbled and ashamed. I admit that I am a sinner. I repent all of the wrong deeds that I have carried out in my body, and the lustful and immoral thoughts in my mind. I want to recommit to pure-- purity. And I humbly ask for your forgiveness. As unworthy as I am, I ask the Lord to forgive me, and I ask you to help me walk with him again. Thank you. - Alright. Now, anyone who would like to approach Jem, offer your forgiveness, please approach. - I forgive you, sweetheart. - I forgive you. May God forgive you. - I forgive you. - I forgive you. - I forgive you. - Jem. I'm an idiot, okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - What are you doing here? - Will you come walk with me just for a second? Please, please. - Why? Why should I? - Please, just listen to me. - I thought you didn't wanna see me. - I need to explain myself to you. Please, listen. I let my dad get in my head, okay? And I got scared. - Well, he's gonna be here any second, so you should go. - But please, just hear me. Just for a minute. I'm going back to the church in Puerto Rico, and I want you to come with me. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. I love you. I wanna be with you. You are the only one that sees me. I don't wanna be without you. - What about Misty, huh? - None of it matters. - What about your family? - As long as I have you, none of it matters. Alright? Jem, look at me. - What is this? - Mrs. Starling, I-- - You get away from her! You knew exactly what you were doing. Get off my property. - Jem-- - Now! It's okay, Jem. Let's go inside, honey. Jem! Jem! Jem! No! - Jem! - Go! Go, go, go! - No, no! Jem! - Oh, my... You're... - Thanks. You okay? - Mm-hmm. - That was unforgivable, what I did to you. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - No, it's not. And with your dad-- - I don't really wanna think about that right now. - I just wish I could take it back. - It's okay. - None of this will matter when we're out there. I can't wait to show it all to you. Well, whenever is good for you, you know, I'm just an hour out, so you let me know. Yeah, that works perfect. That works perfect. There's new tires on there, so you won't have to go back to the shop any time soon. I think you'll be happy. Perfect. We'll see you then. Thanks, Andy. Found someone to buy my car. So we can leave tomorrow. Whoo! Aren't you hot in this? - Hmm. - Hmm? Should we grab some lunch? - Um, I think I'm gonna shower. - I'll bring you back something? - Sure. - Yeah? Burger? Fries? Milkshake? Chili cheese fries? Does that sound good? That's what I'm bringing you. - Okay. - Alright. Don't drown. - Lord, help me to be content.
