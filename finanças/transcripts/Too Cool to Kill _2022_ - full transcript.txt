Didn't you see the sign? You can't enter! Three. Two. One! - Boss! - It's okay. Don't panic. It was just a rock. Bravo! Boss. He's just a demolition worker who didn't get out in time. You didn't need to visit him. My employees are my family. I must show my concern. Harvey. Buddy, how are you doing? How is he? He's no longer in critical danger. But the patient had severe head trauma. He can't speak yet and he can't see anymore. Give him the best eye drops. Pardon? I don't care how much it costs. Just cure him. Don't worry, buddy. Let's pinky swear. Boss! - Something is up. - Wait a second. Out, all of you. Stop panicking. Boss. Your wound might be from a gunshot. What do you mean? We found this at the scene. This is Karl's bullet. Karl? Yes, the hitman, Karl. I heard that the Moment Gang hired him. Luckily, he failed this time. Karl doesn't fail. He is toying with me. We must find Karl. I need to talk to him face-to-face. Boss. People call Karl "Many Faces." There has never been anyone who has seen his real face. Finding him is almost impossible. I don't care! Whatever they paid him, I'll pay ten times that! Why are you still here? Go find him, now! You bunch of idiots! Why are you worked up? Do you know Karl? Move again and I'll remove your tubes! Cut. The last guy, come here. Yes, sir? Explain to me. You were shot in the head. Why were you laughing? Sir, it's a tiny idea I have for my character. I was expressing my ruthless contempt and mockery of death. Interesting. Really? Stick with it. Okay. Now you are shot by a submachine gun. Action. How was that, sir? The submachine gun, contempt, and mockery are all there. Now I want to blast you with a cannon. A cannon is good. That will be challenging. But imagine this, sir. When the cannon hits me, I will be reduced to ashes. I will have no time to perform. Can I get some time to plan it out? - Scram now! - Okay. Wait for me, please. Replace him. Next time, even for the extras, find me smart ones! Got it. Roll again. All units, get ready. Clear the set. - Go, now! - Leave now. All of you! Milan, Harvey brought his men here! Don't panic. Lead the way. Harvey, why didn't you tell me you were visiting me with your men? Are you playing with concrete? - Boss! - What are you doing? Let go of me. I just got a pedicure! Don't move. Harvey, it's all my fault. You lost money on my last movie, but I promise you won't on this one. When I was little, I really loved this Persian cat. But she would only get close to me when she was hungry. So I put her in concrete and turned her into a statue. That way, she would never leave me. Harvey, investing in movies doesn't always wind up well. If you think I owe you, I'll pay you back. State your price. I don't like movies at all. I don't like watching movies either. But I invested so much in your movies. Tell me what it is that I like. Spending money. What do I like? Playing with concrete. All these years, you have been leading me on! Milan, if we become family, then all will be forgiven. I'll die before I marry you. Kill me if you want. Miller, you go first. I'll be right behind you. Don't push me. You can't make up your mind? Let me help you. Mustache. Protect Boss! Karl is here! Karl is here! Karl. Boss, I'm sorry. It was a balloon. And I thought Karl was here to visit me. Yesterday, he said he would come. He is such a busy man. Do you know Karl? Of course I do. He's a fan of mine. A hardcore fan. I'm sorry about earlier. Take a look at this photo. Which one is my good friend, Karl? Karl is not in the photo. I've admired Karl for a long time. Could you please tell him that I really want to befriend him? If you can find him for me, I'll reconsider the things between us. Okay. Give me ten days. I'll bring you Karl. Milan, that doesn't take ten days. Bring him tomorrow. Deal. Tomorrow it is. I'll be waiting. See you tomorrow, Harvey. Milan, I'm glad you're so well-connected. You even know Karl. I don't know Karl. How could you tell such a big lie, Milan? Waiting for my execution tomorrow is torture, Milan. These are our new identities. From the first day I met Harvey, I've been prepared to go on the run. No time to waste. Let's go, Milan. The earliest ship leaves in ten days. No time to waste. Let's get you a wedding dress. Karl. Who is this Karl? Karl is a hitman. The best of the best. No one alive has ever seen his face. No one has seen his face? What are you doing? I'm now ashes. After I get blasted by the cannon, my soul is still expressing my endless contempt and mockery of death and refuses to leave. You fucking... Milan. Milan. He's an idiot. I was just messing with him. Sir. Please have a seat. But my clothes. I saw your acting just now. As an actor, you can bring to life the soul of your character. I think you really put yourself into your character's shoes. As an actress myself, I think your performance is really touching. Thank you, Milan. I am more dedicated to being in character than other people. He has devotion to acting, but not the looks. I don't agree. Look at his face. What a beautiful mooncake face. Mooncake? As round as a mooncake. He does have a round face. Mr. Mooncake, what's your name? My name is Wei Chenggong. Mr. Mooncake, I'm convinced that you will soon impress the audience. Landing a breakout role is nearly impossible. We happen to have a movie coming up. We're looking for a male lead. It's the role of a hitman. Are you available? All these years, I've been waiting for someone to appreciate me as you do. Why are you crying? Where? Where have you been all this time? Good work, guys! Who is he? I don't know. Get some rest, Milan. - Hello. - Hi there. This way. Sit down. Come on. Sit, Mr. Wei. Tomorrow, we'll shoot our first scene. Milan and I are also going to be in it. In this scene, we introduce you to a mob boss. You two finally meet for the first time. To be more specific, he is... Sir, you don't need to explain. Give me the script. I'll figure it out... Mr. Wei, why do you need the script? I want to understand the story first. What if this movie doesn't have a script? How will you act? Then I'll be... Freestyling. That's why I chose you. For this movie, we invented a new way of shooting. We're letting the characters create the story. I think I get it, sir. Trust me, sir. I'll be in character when the cameras are there. The cameras are not there. - The cameras are not there? - The cameras are there. They're just out of sight. Then how am I supposed to act? In the traditional way of shooting, the unnatural lighting and rigid camera angles all hold actors back. The final work is always hollow and boring. So this time, we decided to use natural light and hide all the cameras. This new filming method allows actors to be fully immersed in their roles and free of all limits, giving them free rein. Mr. Wei, will you join us? Guys, the person you are looking for is me. Mr. Wei, on behalf of the art of film, I thank you. Sir, all you have to do is give me a name. Karl. Karl, the hitman. CORONADO HOTEL Harvey won't do anything to us, right? It's just a meeting. Don't worry. Milan. Sir. Breakfast. Are you wearing a wig? This is an idea I came up with for my character. Is this okay, sir? Let's go. We've had breakfast, Mr. Wei. Sir, I made a character bio last night. It tells how Karl grew from an orphan raised by the Italian mafia into a hitman. It's very detailed. Why did he become a hitman? Because deep down he's lonely. Sir, where are we shooting? Right here. Mr. Wei, all my staff and cameras are in the building across the street. You can act any way you want. Just don't stop until I say cut. - Got it. - Mr. Wei. This character Karl is a taciturn hitman. So when you are upstairs, remember, don't talk much. Sir, can I do internal monologues? As long as they are internal. Mr. Wei. I'm sure that your acting will impress the audience. I'll do my best. - Let's go. - Okay. Boss, they're here. Relax. Nice look. Harvey. Harvey. I brought him here. I am Karl. I heard that you are looking for me. How much did the Moment Gang pay you to kill me? I don't understand what you're saying. When there are guns pointed at you, you normally have two options. Surrender or fight. But for an experienced hitman, there is only one option. That is to surrender. Tell them to drop their guns. Drop them. Now! Milan. Forgive me. I fooled you. Later, alligators! Mr. Wei. How was my acting? Beyond expectations. Really? Wait. Harvey would like to see Karl again. Take two. Is that okay? Of course. Action. You two can stay here. We are doomed, Milan. Harvey is going to find out. I am Karl. I heard that you are looking for me. I'm not hallucinating, am I? Didn't he say the same thing earlier? I don't understand what you're saying. Quick learner. I respect your courage and sense of humor. Would you like to join us? You won't be disappointed. Loyalty is above all else. You can save your breath. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't move! A top hitman must train all parts of his body to be lethal weapons. For example, my middle finger. Tell them to drop their guns! A flick of your finger can't kill me. Then let's see which is faster. Your bullets or my finger? I'll count to three. One. Two. Cut! Chill out. Sorry, Harvey. Let me talk to him. What's wrong, sir? Why didn't you join them? Sir, wouldn't that make my character look like a traitor? You have to join them for the story to go on. If you're killed now, what is left to tell? Okay, got it. Hurry. Let's do another take. What was that "cut"? It's his nickname. He was adopted by Italians and has a really long Italian name. So close friends like me just call him Cut. If you like the knife that much, I can give it to you. I am Karl. I would like to join your gang. Jimmy, wine. Drink this, then we are family. Awesome. From now on, you are my brother! 50 cc. Pure blood. I have too many brothers. I can only give you 5 cc. - Bottoms up. - Bottoms up. Glad to have you with us, Cut. What did you just say? Glad to have you with us, Cut. Who the hell are you to say "cut"? Mark this, everyone. He's the only one who gets to say "cut". Am I clear? Quiet. It's still rolling. You will be his contact person. My pleasure, Harvey. Boss, I heard Karl was adopted by Italians. He must speak Italian well. Tonight, let me take him with me on our deal with the Italians. Karl, what do you think? I'm at your service. Mr. Wei, many foreign actors will be in tonight's scene. We will teach you some basic phrases. Remember them. Repeat after me. "Mi risparmi la mia vita." It means, "Spare me." Sir, didn't we agree that I can freestyle? How can you freestyle if you don't know the language? Again. - Veto. - Your veto doesn't count. I miei compaesani I miei occhi sono pieni di lacrime. What was that? Italian. "One can't hold back his tears when he meets his folks." Do you know Italian? I love Italian movies. I studied Italian for ten years to understand the movies. Don't worry, sir. I've had some ideas. I've decided to play both sides of the fence to highlight my character's organizational skills. Mr. Wei. The only thing you need to do is to be a good translator. Don't be a hero. Don't get carried away. Don't get any stupid ideas. And don't freestyle too much. Mr. Wei. Safety first. Is he really Karl? Of course. One and only. Do you know what happens to those who lie to us? Jimmy, everyone that has lied to you is dead. I have no one to ask. Sorry. Sorry that I'm late. Which shall I take? Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm sorry. Is he always this polite? He has killed too many people, so he always tries to atone for his sins with his words. Be good. Excuse me. I'm not disturbing you, am I? No. Karl. Are we being followed? Are we almost there? Slower, please, sir. Okay. Are you putting on eyeliner? Try it. This is our star today. No. I am the star today. Carry it, then you are the star. I'm a star with or without it. Fine. You are the star. You don't have to tell me. Let's go. Yellow! Don't run, Yellow! Can't you just leave it? My character won't be complete without it! Yellow! Jimmy, I have a question. Go ahead, sir. That guy looks like a psycho. You gave him the gun. Aren't you afraid he will shoot us all? Jimmy. Do you see what he is holding? What is it? It's called a machine gun. It's made in America. It's literally a killing machine. A single one of those can take out 20 men in 10 seconds. It's a breeze. Why would I be afraid? Then I have another question. Ask away. Are you wearing eyeliner? Get your ass into the car. Language, kid. Where's the cat? I didn't catch it. Then what is this? A double? Doesn't it prick you? Believe it or not, I know where the machine is. What machine? It's in that window. How do you know? It has the best line of view, sweeping through the whole room. Come here. Let's switch seats. Then it can catch my face. Get up. Are you ready? Are you ready? We're ready. We're ready. I was asking if you were ready, not him. I was asking if you were ready, not him. Him? Who is he? Him? Who is he? Don't translate every single word I say. Some words are just for you. Don't translate those. Go. Do you have the money? What money? You should be asking him about this one. You should be asking him about this one. Ask who? What the hell are you saying? Ask who? What the hell are you saying? Listen. When I look at him and talk, you translate. When I look at you, you don't. Got it? You should have told me this beforehand. How was I supposed to know? Sorry, let's go again. Go. Do you have the money? Do you have the money? I do. Do you have the gun? You should ask him, not me. How would I know? I am asking him! Then you should look at him. Why are you looking at me? You are the one talking to me. Of course I should look at you. Should I look at your hedgehog instead? What's the arguing about? What did he say? He asked me where the gun is. How am I supposed to know? That question is for me. Why didn't you translate it? Why would I when he was looking at me? I was sticking to your rule. What I say, you translate by the rule. What he says, translate all of it. Is it clear now? Did you say that? How was I to know if you didn't tell me? Go again. Do you have the money? Do you have the money? Where is the gun? Where is the gun? Show him the gun. The gun. Where is the gun? In the case! Here. Hold it for me. It pricks. Where's the gun? It's too heavy, so I took it out earlier. We can use special effects. What special effects? Don't talk. It's too heavy. Nice doing business with you. Kill them! Kill them! Kill who? Who are you looking at? Should I translate it or not? Take cover! Are you okay? This is exhilarating! Give me a gun! Gun! Now! He's out! Give me another gun! I'm out of ammo! I don't have any! Figure something out! Run! Sorry. You picked on the wrong person. The money is fake. Did you know all this? That doesn't matter at all. I am Karl Cecilio. Cut! Good job, Jimmy. Good work. It's a wrap. No, it's not. The machine wasn't in the best spot. Do another take. It didn't get my face. That's not possible. I have a lot of cameras placed here, all aimed at your face. Really? Good work, everyone! Did I kill it? You totally killed it. When can I see the footage? We'll look back later. Don't look back now! Look back after you get home. How did he know the deal was phony? He didn't answer me directly. Boss, Karl is too dangerous. We must get rid of him now. He can't be trusted. Keep an eye on him. I want to know his every move. Okay. Milan. - Stop screaming. - Get off! What are you doing? I need to talk to you. I won't listen! Mr. See owned a saw. And Mr. Soar owned a seesaw. See's saw sawed Soar's seesaw. Go away! Help! Mr. See owned a saw. And Mr. Soar owned a seesaw. See's saw sawed Soar's seesaw before Soar saw See, which made Soar sore. Had Soar seen See's saw before See sawed Soar's seesaw, See would say, "Who is it?" Milan? What time is it? Is your clock not working? It's probably past midnight. Do you practice tongue twisters this late? Is something wrong with my enunciation? I was sleeping! I'm so sorry, Milan. Sorry for disturbing you. What's that smell? I made noodles. Do you want some? I need to stay in shape. No chopsticks? Hi. Are you busy working? I'm looking for you. Good work. How is the shooting going? Pretty well. Here's the thing. Is it possible for me to see the past few days of footage? You... What footage? You know, me with the big gun and the knife. What do you mean? The footage! Mr. Wei. Quick. Let's load up. Thank you. Let me help you with that. I'll get that. Come this way. Sir, tell me. Are they our crew members? Of course they are. That is our cameraman, Tiger. Our gaffers, Pig and Dog. And our stunt coordinator, Shoryuken. We have a stunt coordinator? Mr. Wei, what exactly do you want? Nothing, sir. I just can't wait to see our footage. Let me have a look, sir. Didn't I tell you? I'm not showing you the footage. I don't want you to get distracted. You don't get me. Sir, please put yourself in the actors' shoes. I've been filming for days. I haven't seen the footage or the cameras. How can I not be distracted? Sometimes, I even wonder if we are really making a movie. Do you think we are lying to you, Mr. Wei? That's not what I mean. So all these people are just playing with you? Do you think that gunfight, the broken glasses, and flying bullets were all real? Calm down, sir. And that mob deal? Were all those men in black actually real-life gangsters? Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Wei. I'm sorry, sir. If you have no desire for artistic pursuit and prefer the old school, I'll get the cameras now. I'll give you close-ups. All close-ups. Thank you, sir. I'll go get ready. What? They're filming in the bar. Let's make use of it. Milan, just play along or he will get suspicious. No problem. There is a report about a gas leak here. Everyone must leave now! I don't smell anything. It will be too late when you do. - Quick! - Hurry up! - Leave quickly. - Evacuate now. Hurry up. Go farther. You don't want to be blown up. All set, Milan. I'm afraid he won't stop acting, so as soon as I get to the door, say cut right away. I got this, Milan. Keep watch. Tell me if anyone returns. Ready! Action! Why did you turn the camera on? Hi, handsome. This is my address. Write to me. Cut! Bravo, Mr. Wei. That was a hell of a show. - It's a wrap. - No! Don't wrap it up yet, sir. I still have so many great ideas. Please let me act them out. You'll love them. Milan, let's go again. I have so many spectacular ideas. Why don't we quickly do one more take? - Okay! - Remember to speed it up. I won't use it if you're too slow. Sure. I'll speed it up, sir. Miss. Please get me a bottle of spirits. Thank you. Okay. I need to disinfect my wound to prevent... Handsome? This is my address. Write to me. Watch out! It's dangerous out there. Someone is after me. You can't go outside. Forgive me. When I stopped you just now, my wound split open. Gosh. What are you? A straw man? Find me a needle and thread. I need to stitch up. No, it's nothing serious. I can fix you up. There. Remember to write to me! Cut! Bravo, Mr. Wei. That's a wrap. No, wait! Sir, that makes no sense. I prepared a dance to show my pain. Pain, my ass. It's clear. This way of shooting is not for you. - No, one more take, sir. - Mr. Wei. You and the cameras are like Romeo and Juliet. You just can't be together. What's going on here? Did you see that? The gas got to him. Who is it? It's me, Milan. Sir. Mr. Wei, what do you need Milan for? Here's the thing. My parents are visiting me today, so I would like to invite Milan to join us for dinner. Is that okay? Sorry, Mr. Wei. Milan is not available today. How about a raincheck? Sure. Miller. How much time do we have? Three hours. I think I should go and tell him the truth. Come on, Milan. If he causes a fuss, how will we leave? It wasn't easy finding this fishing boat. Our next chance is another week away! Miller, I always tell you to be a responsible man. Wei Chenggong isn't involved in this. We can't leave like this. This time, I won't hide. THE TRUTH Milan? - Come in, please. - Mr. Wei. Mom and Dad, look at who is here. Milan! A big star! Milan, although I'm blind, my heart can see clearly. Without you, he would've been a walk-on forever. Today, we would like to drink to you. Milan. Although I'm strict with my son, I know he's very outstanding. He learned opera at four and was performing at six. He has grown into a handsome man. Big eyes, long lashes, a high nose, and a cute mouth. And especially when he smiles, his dimples drive the girls crazy. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Let's drink. Be my guest. Milan. Mrs. Wei. Actually, Chenggong is not our son. Look. This is our son. We lost our son because of an accident. His dad is in bad health and has a quick temper, so I didn't dare to tell him. But it's hard to keep secrets like that. So... Chenggong came up with an idea. He said that he could act as our son. Chenggong was my son's good friend. He knew my son well. So we decided to give it a try. And now, it has been five years. During these five years, when he was not at work, he took care of everything in this family. He really treats us as his own parents. And we also treat him as our own son. Miller! Milan. I'm so impressed. I can't believe you would have an actor play Karl. How creative. What do you want? Let him carry on. But... with my script. Bring him to me. Tomorrow, I have a big scene for him. Remember. Don't play any tricks. Mom and Dad, take care! I'll visit you once we're wrapped up! Okay. See you! Milan. I couldn't help myself. Mr. Wei. Our movie has been canceled. You can leave now. We ran out of money. I can give up my paycheck. Milan, I have some savings. It is not much, but even if it's for one day, let's figure this out together, okay? I don't want to lie to you anymore. You can't act at all. Have you ever seen your own acting? It's total crap. Leading actor? What makes you think you can be a leading actor? Are you good enough? All you do is play to the gallery. You are just a clown. Do you love acting? Do it somewhere else. This place is not for you. Where is Wei Chenggong? He left. He left? To where? I think you will never see him again. Are you playing me for a fool? Milan! Are you rehearsing? Jimmy, look at you. What's that shitty pose? You have to look fierce. It's scary, isn't it? Like this. Mr. Wei! See how scared the director is? What was your line just now? Are you playing me for a fool? "Are you playing me for a fool?" Are you playing me for a fool? Did you piss yourself? Work on it, Jimmy. Milan. Who told you to come back? Don't you remember what I told you? I remember every single word of it. Milan, no one has ever given me any advice about my acting. Thank you for your advice. Wei Chenggong. You are doing a scene with me tonight. The director is going to be behind the camera, so for the details, you'll take orders from me. Why should I take orders from you? You think you can boss me around the way you do to those extras? Who do you think you are, Jimmy? Mr. Wei. Just do as he says. Sir, are you being blackmailed? Of a sort. He's the investor. I really can't stand those who compromise for money. Where are you going? I'm putting on my makeup. Eyes on the road. I know I shouldn't say this. I didn't like you before. But I didn't expect you would be generous enough to invest in the art of film. So I've decided that we can continue working together. Fine. No problem. What are we shooting next, Boss? We're killing Harvey. We're killing Harvey? But I don't think that makes sense, Boss. You see, Karl and Harvey have already joined hands. They're buddies now. Won't I be a traitor? Harvey is jealous of your talent and plots to kill you so that you won't become a threat. But you are incredibly smart. You discover this secret and decide to beat him to it. So in this scene, either he is finished or your role is finished. Do the math yourself. He is so finished. This scene is a card game. I'll go upstairs first. Ten minutes after that, you go up there, shoot Harvey dead, and the scene is over. Awesome. Don't use it until then. Don't worry, Boss. - Come on! - Reveal your cards. Three eights! Boss. Impressive! I'm getting tired of winning. Boss, you are on fire today. Buddy, what brings you here? Harvey, you and me. One game. Sure. Come. Sit. Sit. Nice trick. Are we using your cards? Let's use yours. Mine is not for playing. Do you have any chips for the game? Deal. Playing cards is just like life. You never know what you are going to get. Buddy, I've been on fire lately. Quit while you still can. If I don't end this today, I'm not going anywhere. Good. All in. Ace is your only chance. We don't have to count this round. Wait. I would like to raise. It's all in. How can you raise? Just do what you're supposed to do. Let him be. It doesn't matter. What are you betting on? Betting on your life. What do you mean? Actually, I've got nothing. I don't even know how to play. But as a hitman, what I have is not only excellent killing skills, but also tremendous mental fortitude. Today, I'll make Harvey lose his pants. He will pay the price for his betrayal. When did I betray you? This is my internal monologue. You're not supposed to hear it. Why did you respond to it? I can't believe it. Sorry, let's roll again, guys. From my line. Betting on your life. I fold. Man, you can't fold. What am I supposed to do if you fold? Say, "Call." Just say, "Call." Sorry. Again. Betting on your life. Call. Your life is mine now. You didn't win. Come on, man. We are not doing a close-up. Will you please not interrupt me, okay? Don't interrupt me. Go again. Your life is mine now. What the hell is all this? - No! What are you doing? - You got everything you want. Now let them go. He killed my beloved boss. How can I let him go? I will bury you with Harvey today. You scum! Thank you. When I hired Karl, I never thought he would miss. Now he is even missing. And then, you guys showed up. Harvey would never have thought that he would die because of a fool. I'm begging you, Jimmy. Let them go. By the rules of our Magic Gang, you all have to die today. However, if we become family, then all will be forgiven. What Harvey can't have, I shall have them all. Stop. Pull him out. Why? Jimmy wants to do it himself. Mr. Wei, that's a wrap. This is your paycheck. It's all a lie. There is no shoot, is there? Thank you. You can go now. I was almost buried alive. Sorry. Just go. Go now. Mr. Wei, if my fiancée hadn't threatened me, I wouldn't want to let you go. Every time I think of his... You've done your part. Leave now. Go. Just go. Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you, Milan. Thank you for this chance, sir. I've done my part. I'm so happy. Just leave. I hope we can work together again. No problem. Leave or I'll flick you. I dodge. See you. What a survivor. The bullet was 1 cm away from his heart. And he was so lucky. He was saved by a fisherman. He looks familiar. Isn't he... What's his name? It's not our business. Let's go. Karl. Karl. I'm Karl. You're looking for me? Everyone chases after a dream In which there is no direction A moment of personal satisfaction A hazy panorama yet unknown Life is like a dream Ups and downs included within Seeking pleasure, avoiding hardship Ignorant of suffering and happiness Every God-given talent Has its use Cut. Bring in the double. Flap your wings, soar high Ready, action. No need to be in a dream A long vision of grandeur The dream vanishes without a trace The drunkard sobers up in the morn Did he ever possess such glory? There is a line in the next scene. Do you want to do it? Micah, I will avenge Arthur Morgan today. - All set? - Yes. Every God-given talent Has its use Stay back! Flap your wings, soar high No need to be in a dream Why seek a dream? I'll cut to the chase. I have a movie coming up. I want you to be the male lead. It's the role of a hitman. Are you available? Is there a script? Of course. Are there cameras? What kind of movie shoots without cameras? Then may I ask why you want me for the part? I've seen your performance. What? Hi, handsome. This is my address. Write to me. Cut! Bravo, Mr. Wei. That was a hell of a show. - It's a wrap. - No! Don't wrap it up yet, sir. I still have so many great ideas. Please let me act them out. You'll love them. Watch out! Mr. Mooncake, what's your name? My name is Wei Chenggong. Mr. Mooncake, I'm convinced that you will soon impress the audience. Mr. Wei, will you join us? Do you love acting? Do it somewhere else. This place is not for you. Go. Just go. Find me a needle and thread. I need to stitch up. No, it's nothing serious. I can fix you up. There. Remember to write to me! Cut! Bravo, Mr. Wei. That's a wrap. Look at how bad Milan is in this. She's in such a hurry as if the camera was stolen. But you are completely different. You know nothing about acting. You're the blank canvas I'm looking for. What do you say? Are you interested in joining us? Sir. Thank you for your faith in me. But I'm afraid I have to decline the offer. This could be your first lead role. My first lead role is not finished yet. Milan! Why can't I see Milan? Listen carefully. Jimmy is about to be my brother-in-law. I suggest you show me some respect. Jimmy told us to beat you every time we see you. If he really said that, you would have done it. You've beaten me. Now let me see her. Leave! Milan. Mr. Wei! Get up. Our movie is not finished yet. My sister and I have only had each other all these years. Today, I hand her over to you. If she suffers even a little bit, then it must be her own fault. I'll talk some sense into her. Good. From now on, you'll be our contact person. Go on up, Milan. Don't keep my brother-in-law waiting. Dear gangsters, bodyguards, and whatever-your-names-are, good evening. I now announce the wedding is officially over. What was that? Go and check! Who's there? Who's there? What's going on? There are gunmen everywhere! We are surrounded! Did you see who they are? No matter who they are, they can't shoot at a place of worship. I'll go talk to them. They've gone too far! I'm here to negotiate. Don't shoot me. We are all reasonable men. Go away. There's no space. Lights off! What's going on? Don't worry. It's all part of the plan. That's enough. Come over here. Hurry. Hurry. Stay calm. Put on the wig. Quick. Friends out there! Don't shoot! Let's talk it out! DIE Together. Three, two, one. Now. Guys, hold your fire. Stay calm. I am unarmed. Who are you? We are from Italy. During the last deal, something went wrong. So we are here today to get even. Don't get any closer. Be careful, Maldini. We don't want to hurt our friends. What do you want? I'm looking for someone. There was a man with a short ponytail. Where is he? Sorry. I've killed that guy. I suggest you hand over the ponytail guy. Even I can't control Maldini when he is angry. Okay. Okay. Take off your hats. Boss, mine is a braid. Jimmy. What do we do, Jimmy? If we don't hand over a man with a ponytail, we are all going to die here. So you are here. Thank you for sacrificing your family. - Let's go! - No! Milan! - Miller! - Milan! - Miller! - Milan! - Milan! - Jimmy! You asshole! How could you give up my brother? Miller. I'm going to kill all of you! You are my wife! You can't die! Now we're even, my friend. I have one last request. Our boss is a fan of Milan. Can we have Milan come over so they can take a photo together? In your dreams! A signature at most! All right. Milan, after you. See you, my friends. Until next time. Hurry back, wifey. Gentlemen, put the guns down. Today is my wedding day. If you don't mind, come in and join us, okay? Go get them! Hurry. Get out. Do you know how to drive? How could you crash the car? It's your fault for changing in the car. Where is the ship? It's here. The cruise ship is 10 NM away. Let's catch up with them. Come on. Get it into the water. Are you sure you're here to save us? Move back. Hurry. Back up. Let's see how you can escape this time! Stay back. Did you want to fool me with some cardboard? Do you think I'm stupid? Take Milan back. Throw the rest of them into the sea. Don't move! Back away! You just don't get tired of acting. Do it. We'll die together. Do it. See these? I'm a walking bomb. Let us go or we'll all die here! If you go, I'll shoot you. If you shoot me, I'll bomb you. You'll bomb me? I'll shoot you when you're farther away. Then I'll stand right in front of you! Guys, it's time for you to know the truth. I'm sure you can tell that I am not Karl. I'm just a performing artist. It was him, Jimmy, who ordered me to shoot Harvey. He's the one who killed your boss! I can testify! He really is just a walk-on. Jimmy, I think you need to explain. Where is Harvey's body? Okay. I'll explain. This is actually all made up! Jimmy. Make a wish. I'll kill you! Jimmy, you haven't explained yet. Move aside! You traitors! You are the traitor. Forward. - Harvey. - Harvey. Jimmy. You didn't expect to see me alive, did you? Harvey, it's all my fault. It has nothing to do with the others. Harvey, it has nothing to do with Milan. I'm the one who shot you. Boss, they're framing me! I've never met Karl before. How could I have hired him? Remember this photo? You took this. How did Karl get it? But you didn't lie about one thing. You certainly don't know Karl. Even when he is standing right in front of you, you still can't recognize him. It's you? Take him away. Boss, it was Milan! She told me to do it! She seduced me! Shut up! Harvey. Please give me a chance. I would like to kick his ass myself. Jimmy, I've been a martial arts double for over ten years. Today, I'm going to put an end to this. That's the end! The end! Take him. People are good at their own jobs. It's normal that an actor can't beat a gangster. Not every story has a happy ending. SOMETIME LATER Everything worked out. Do you really have to go? I'm tired. I want to make a change. Are you coming with me? No. I have a family to take care of. Right. Then... I'll see you around. After today, we might never see each other again. Do you know? I once swore that if someone were willing to risk his life for me, I would marry him. I also once swore that if any woman dares to lie to me, I won't forgive her. Cut. - Good job, Milan! - Perfect! Harvey, do you like the ending? - You won't lose money. - Thank you for the free act. We are even now. I wonder what the viewers will think. Karl, what do you think? I think the visually-impaired are important too. Everyone, let's hurry up. Get ready for another close-up. Your acting when you got shot was not very convincing. What was with all the grunting? What do you mean? Are you teaching me how to act? Sir! Wei Chenggong has complaints. Show him your version. Well, when your sister got shot, why did she stumble like she was blind? Who did you call blind? Who did you call blind? No, I was talking about Milan's acting when she got shot. Buddy. Okay. Cut. What was that? Italian. Why are you doing this to me? I love you so much, but you only love your punchline. Do you know what you are doing? La la la I really respect you. Wait a second. Slowly. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Give me that. Cut. The clip fell out. - Your head is bleeding. - Seriously? You're bleeding. I'm okay. Wei Xiang. This is your final shot in Too Cool to Kill. It's a wrap. Tail slate. Thank you to everyone, especially Wenxiong. Three years ago, the two of us promised to make this movie a reality. It has been really hard for him. I also want to thank Yan Fei, Damo, and the two production companies for giving me this opportunity. Thank you to all of you for helping me with my first leading role ever. Thank you.
