♪ ♪ [sighs] [phone ringing] [sighs] [ringing continues] Hey. [Karen] Nora! [Nora] Karen! Ya blew me off last night. Oh, you would've loved the band we saw. Oh. I'm not really up for much these days, Karen. You need to get out of the house. You're like a shut-in. Hey, what are you doing right now? I'm trying to write, but I'm... stuck. I guess I just need a little inspiration. Nora, Mark was three months ago. Look, I know he broke your heart, but you need to get back to your romance blog. You can't keep the Internet fans waiting. I know. I am. Well, I was calling to complain about this missing woman case - I was assigned, but... - No, no! I'm here for you. How is life in the trenches? The woman's name is Maureen Gallagher. The paper wants to do a whole series. It's a crime beat. If it bleeds, it leads, that whole thing. Mm-hmm. Gruesome. Yeah, most of my articles end up online anyway. Well, there's nothing wrong with a little online following. I mean, if it wasn't for my romance blog, my Cassandra stories would never see the light of day. Hey, that is not true! You're gonna land a big book deal, but right now we're talking about me. Of course. Continue. You remember freshman year at BU me, you, and Scotty, in Bernstein's writing seminar? He was like, "Forget traditional journalism. Newspapers are dead!" - Yeah. - I can tell he was right. Barbara is driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like dating that woman is like death by a thousand little paper cuts. No, a thousand is too few. Nora? Nora? What? Yeah? I'm trying to complain about my girlfriend here. - Are you listening? - Yeah. Something about paper cuts. You seem distracted. My hot neighbor is back again. Are you watching him from your window again? No, I'm writing. [chuckles] Talk about inspiration. You like him, you do something about it. [sighs] I'm coming over Thursday. Okay, well, bring wine. Uh, duh. Okay. Love you. Bye. [Nora V.O.] Cassandra often watched the stranger from her window. Strong, handsome, mysterious. She wondered what it would be like to know the stranger. Her thoughts raced. A red light emanated from within her. She had forgotten what inspiration felt like. Might this stranger hold the key? Could her muse be right next door? [keys jingling] Huh. [door opening] [door closes] [Nora V.O.] Cassandra'd watched him come and go, often with bright, brilliant, new brunettes in hand. Cassandra was intrigued. He lived tucked away in the secret of shadows. She fantasized about meeting the stranger, for the red light grew warmer. ♪ ♪ [vocalizing] [gasps] [Nora V.O.] The stranger appeared out of the shadows, enveloping her. Cassandra held her breath as his hands coasted over her body. She wondered how the touch of a stranger could seem so familiar. [phone rings] Hi, Scotty. [Scotty] Morning, sleepyhead. Did you sleep on the couch again? - Mmph. - Yes? You can't just nod. You're on the phone, Nora. What do you want, Scotty? It's early. Come meet me. I'm writing an article about breakfast potatoes and I need you to weigh in. Hash browns, fritters, tater tots, or home fries. [groans] Tots. And since this is work, I can expense everything. Come on, Nora. What do you say? I'll meet you in 15 minutes. - Hey. - Hey. [Scotty] I'm glad you came out. Really. I haven't... I haven't seen you in weeks - and you look great. - Thanks. I mean, a little tired, but great. What? I stayed up all night writing. - Um... - Huh? I forgot what it felt like to be inspired. Hm. Well, this is why I write about food, not people. I mean, give me some extra spicy kimchi or a perfect soufflé, and that's inspiration. I have this neighbor... - Yeah? - Who I... occasionally sometimes... maybe... watch... through the window. I never pegged you for a peeping Tom. I'm not, like, busting out the telescope. It's just the angle of the buildings. I can see into his bedroom. Kinky. - No! - Yes. It's innocent. - Mostly. - Good for you. And Mark was, what, six months ago? Three months ago. Mark wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail and surf Cabo and I am a homebody who needs constant Wi-Fi access. We weren't really built to last, but... You were just too different. Yeah, I know. But back to this neighbor rebound, like... No! It's not that. It... it's just a little daydreaming... about his eyes... and his smile... - Okay. - And his chest. I... I get it, Scotty. I know I tend to have a little bit of a... overactive imagination, but since I write romance novels, I don't think it's such a bad thing. Nora, I want you to have something. Someone real in your life. So do I. [door opening] [sighs] Stupid. Did you lock yourself out? Yeah. [chuckles] I guess... I guess I left my keys in there and I don't even have my phone. Oh. Well... you can use mine. I mean, we could call a locksmith. Oh. Yeah. Thank you. I'll... I'll just wait here. Or you can come in if you want. All right. Oh. He said 40 minutes. For the wait. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. [ambient music playing] [chuckles] So how long have we been neighbors? Um... about two years. Has it been that long? Mm. I'm Nora Nichols. [chuckles] Lucas Wheeler. - Now we're not strangers anymore. - Right. Um, you're a... a writer? Yeah. There is a method to this madness. And what do you do? Ah. Photographer. Yeah. That makes sense. That's why you're gone all the time. Yeah. I get sent to New York a lot on assignment. Oh. And what do you shoot in New York? Fashion? Sometimes, yeah. I actually had a client over last night. We did a test shoot. Oh. Client. Hm. Your, um... your boyfriend's not around tonight. Ex-boyfriend. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... No, that's okay. What's, uh, what's your... your genre? Romance. Mostly. You know, fantasy versus reality. Oh. Prefer fantasy. [chuckles] [chuckles] [both laughing] How do you focus this? - Let me show you. - Okay. Sorry. To set up focus, you want it... - close like that. - Oh, hey! - Like that. - Sneaky! And see, that is why I don't want to work in fashion forever. 'Cause it's all about appearances. That's the opposite of why I love photography. And so why do you love photography? 'Cause it's a journey. And you're searching for that... that one perfect moment. And then you can capture it forever. You try to find the real moment and I try to create it. I mean, that's... That's what writing is. You choose the words so carefully and give the characters emotions and create this whole world. Hm. One real moment. I search for it and you create it. [knocking] - Oh, shit! I... - Oh, shi... - Oh... - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Hey. - Lucas Wheeler? - Yeah, that's me. This it? Change it or for a new set of keys? I just need one key. [Nora V.O.] The stranger emerged from the darkness. His rough, vulnerable power drew her closer to the red light. They lingered, sharing a charged moment. She looked upon his face with new wisdom. Cassandra was determined to discover something in him no one had ever seen. [sighs] [giggles] [gasps] [keys jingling] Hey! - Hey! - Thank you so much for the photo. Oh, yeah. My pleasure. [chuckles] - Ooh. - Uh. Sorry. It's okay. Your work is so beautiful. Well... have a nice day. - Yeah, you too. - Okay. Bye, Nora. Bye. [Nora V.O.] This time was different for Cassandra. Her body was alive, burning, satisfied. She moved forward, confident and in control. It was in this moment that Cassandra set her sights on something new and decided to pursue this inspiration. [Karen] Nora, come on. We had to go 10 minutes ago. Oh! Sorry about the buzzer. Oh, it's fine. You look great! - You look great! - Whatever. And your makeup! So beautiful. And now we're playing the compliment game. [chuckles] - The car is almost here. - Okay. Sorry. I'm just still getting myself together. Scotty was worried you'd bail. You hate stuff like this. Oh, well, it's his birthday. Oh, I didn't get him anything. Can I share a present with you? Yeah, sure. What is... all this? Okay, I get it. Good job, Lucas. - [chuckles] - [phone vibrates] Oh! Car is here. Oh! Um, I'll meet you down there in two minutes. Okay. But you're telling Scotty why we're late. Okay. [door closes] - Hey! - Hey. Are you staying in tonight? Yeah, I have some work to do. - I got some photos to develop. - Oh. The red light! - What? - [chuckles] I would sometimes see a mysterious red light underneath your door and I always wondered what it was. - You have a dark room. - I do. Do you wanna come inside? See the mysterious red light for yourself? [sighs] I have a friend waiting. A female friend. Karen. But raincheck though.

Well, or at least Cassandra is. I'm so proud of you! - [chuckles] - Like... Yeah, I don't know! It's... it's so easy this time. The words just come. It's because you're writing about yourself.

Yes, what? Oh, yeah. Elevator's down the hall and to the left. Thank you. Thank you. Frankly, Margaret, I'm tired of seeing women surprised by their own sexuality. Somewhere along the way, we convinced ourselves that female fantasies are more about what men want than what women want. We've lost control of our own fantasies, and it has to change. I mean, women can be heroic and ruthless and courageous and kind, and yes, sexual. We have to stop projecting these dangerous ideals of being a certain weight and looking a certain way. I mean, we didn't invent these ideals and we certainly don't value them, so why have we agreed to live them? Hm. I have been watching your career for a while now, Nora. You've got quite a decent following, lots of reads, lots of shares, and your Cassandra ebooks have had some success. They have. But this... is fresh. I'm going to need you to pull everything off your romance blog immediately. We'll talk to PR, we'll have them put out some kind of notification to your readers saying that... Wait, why? Because I want to publish a Cassandra novel. -[gasps] - And we can't be giving this away online for free if we want people to buy it. Margaret, I... Congratulations, Nora. This is different from your other work. Now, we're going to finalize the deal first obviously, so please talk to your lawyer, but I see big things. A national book tour, maybe even some talk show appearances. Oh! Margaret, this is fantastic. Thank you. When can I have a final draft? Two weeks? Two weeks? We have a gap in our publishing schedule, so I'm gonna need it by the end of the month. I see. I know it's a very tight deadline, but hey, that's how things go.

He was freaking out, breaking things. It was really scary. Hm. Well, I hate to play devil's advocate, but you did just dump the guy. What are you talking about? You broke his heart and he went home and tore up his bedroom. You can't blame the guy because you can actually see into his bedroom. You remember back in grad school when Melissa cut me loose? I put my fist through a wall and I screamed in the street and I got drunk every night for, like, a week. This was different. It was like he wanted me to see him. But isn't that your little game? Like, you guys watch each other through the window? Maybe he's still playing. Well, it's not fun anymore. And I have the biggest meeting of my career tomorrow. I mean today in five hours.

If you want me to answer any questions... Fine. Mr. Wheeler, why don't you come down to the station with us? - Ms. Nichols? - Yes? You'll stay in your own apartment from now on. [police radio chatter] [Officer] Sir? [police radio chatter] Karen... [Karen] Are you okay? What's wrong? I just had a crazy run-in with Lucas and the police. The police? Nora! What happened? [sighs] I don't want to talk about it. What'd you find? I found Maureen Gallagher. Wait, what? Maureen eloped with her boyfriend last month and was found in Riverside today. Turns out it was a runaway case. But she was reported missing. Yeah, well, I guess her parents didn't approve of the guy. Oh, my God. Yeah, turns out Lucas is just some broody creep, not a murderer. He did know Maureen though. They did a shoot together last year. Yeah. Well, that's the last time that we play Nancy Drew. - Deal? - Deal. Do you still wanna come over? Yeah. I'll bring pizza and we can discuss your taste in men. Ha ha. I can make a salad, but, um, I still have, like, 30 pages to write. I'll proofread.

[grunts] [grunts] [phone rings] - [ringing stops] - [gasping] You never answer it anyway. Lucas, this isn't you. Karen is coming. She'll be here any second. You always have time for your friends. Karen... and Scotty. Scotty. Did you... You've seen how he looks at you. You could have killed him. You lied to me. No, I didn't. - I read your book. - I didn't. It's about me. You used me. No. I'm sorry, Lucas. - [grunts] - [shattering] [groans] You think you're cute? [grunts] [groans] - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nora? [gasps] Oh, God. Nora. You're okay. [Woman] [laughs] Oh, I'm gonna need a car service! [overlapping chatter] [Margaret] Oh, my God, Nora. Our numbers are going to be huge! Gillian Flynn just tweeted out a recommendation. They're calling it an intimacy thriller. No more sappy romance novels for you, young lady. This is the big league. Your public awaits. Thank you, Margaret. Go. [cheers and applause] Hi. I'm Nora. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Who should I make it out to? - For Christina please. - Okay. - Thank you! - Thank you so much! - Thank you so much! - Thank you! [all cheer] Look at this line! Your fans are crazy. Yeah, the price of fame. Oh, and what would you know about that? I'm the one who actually paid the price. Hey, no pouting, Angela Lansbury. Sign our books. - Who should I make it out to? - "To Scotty... whose unbridled sexuality inspired all the love scenes in this book". - Uh-huh. - Mm. And for mine, you can just put "To Karen, whom I love and worship". Of course. Thank you guys for coming. Oh, we wouldn't have missed it. - Dinner tonight? - Yes! - And you're buying. - Ha! Who do I make it out to? How about, "One real moment. I search for it and you create it". It's my favorite line when they first meet. In the book. My friends tease me. They, uh, they say I look like the guy you describe. So what do you say? Do I look like your fantasy guy? ♪ ♪
