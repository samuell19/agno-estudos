So that's why we gotta win to make it into the playoffs. Well, it's great to see such commitment, but your mother and I, we're not sure you should be putting softball first. But, Dad, I'm on honor roll. I know. [Kat] You don't have to worry about me. You can play, but you're getting a real degree. I'm gonna play, and we're gonna win, so.

(tense, exciting music) I told you we were gonna win. I didn't doubt you. You were amazing out there. Coach said all the scouts were very impressed. He did? Professional softball player and a lawyer? I don't know, Kat, I'm not sure you can do both. You can, technically, but you just want me to be a lawyer. I just want you to have a regular source of income. That's what I want.

Oh, please, no, no, no. (droning music) The Eatonton Journal emailed, asking for an interview. William, did you hear me? I have to go meet with the prosecuting attorney. What do they want? (dark, droning music) [Prosecutor] In the interest of getting this thug off the streets as soon as possible, his attorneys agreed to plead guilty to assaulting an officer, possession with the intent to distribute, and resisting arrest, and that's all in addition to his parole violations. We're looking at five to seven. Years, that's it? If he keeps clean, he could be out in three, but, yes, that's what it's looking like. This kid murdered my daughter. He should be executed or life in jail, no parole. Mr. Duncan, we've got no video, no photos, no eyewitnesses except you. You got a concussion during the struggle. You want everything riding on an eye test, some optometrist they put on the stand who's gonna say you were in shock and hallucinating? I know what I saw. Your biggest problem is that there's no gun. Well, they took it. Who's they? I'm just saying what they're gonna say. Look, if you wanna try to convince the DA to take this to trial, you're welcome to. But this case is so paper thin, the judge is probably gonna throw it out, and Danny Fetter is gonna be back on the streets. At least this way, he's off for a good few years. Basically, it's your word against his. It's bullshit is what it is. It's bullshit, and you know it! I'm not disagreeing with you, Mr. Duncan, but I gotta be honest, I had to schmooze the judge to agree to half those charges. The plea deal makes the most sense, trust me. And that night, outside the Mexican restaurant that you and your daughter visited, can you point out the attacker that you saw and physically fought with? (percussive music) No. (spectators gasp) [Judge] Settle. Not sure I can confidently identify that man as the attacker, Your Honor. What the fuck are you doing? Mr. Duncan, are you absolutely sure that you cannot confidently point out the attacker? Yes, Your Honor, I'm 100% sure. Mr. Fetter, you are free to go. I see no reason to further waste this court's time. Case dismissed. (gavel bangs) (low, percussive music) (discordant, droning music) I'm so fucking proud of you. You can do anything in this life, you know that? You can do anything. I love you. Come on. (dramatic music) You did good. You can run this world, the streets, everything. It can be yours.

[Woman] Right. [Man] Come on now. Hurry the fuck up, bitch. All right, whatever. (ringtone jangles) You look like you could use some fun, baby. I'm fine, thanks. Missing out.

I came here to inform you that Danny Fetter was murdered last night. Oh. Well, how did it happen? Not sure yet. What were you doing last night, Mr. Duncan? I was here. I mean, I went for a walk, but I was here. Yeah, he was here. Am I a suspect, Detective? At this point, I can't say. I didn't kill him. Sure, I understand what you're saying. You have any idea who did? No, but all of those Fetter boys run in some dicey circles, so we got a few leads. Well, I wish we could help. As you can imagine, my wife and I are going through our own grief right now, so. Well, I'll let you know if there is. Here. Give me a call if you think of anything that might be helpful, and don't leave town without letting me know, okay? Might have a few more questions. [William] Sure. (William sighs) (Jen sighs) You okay? Yeah. Where were you last night? I just said, I went for a walk. You never just go for a walk. Well, I've also never had my only child murdered before. I don't want you to go back to how you were. What does that mean? You mean when I had bullets flying around my head and my best friends were dying all around me? Is that what you meant? This is different. It's our daughter. (Jen sniffles) You know what? I can't believe you'd even say that. (Jen sniffles) (pulsing music) [Thug] To Danny. [Thug] Danny. (glasses clink) Salut. [Thug] He was good fucking man. (loud hip hop music) I wanna find the person that did this. I don't just wanna take their life. I want him to suffer indescribably. Don't trip, boss. We gonna find him. We gonna find him. Will we? Where will we find him? Is he in your bottle that you're drinking? Is he under this table? Huh, are you him? Do you plan on finding him while you're sitting on your fat fucking ass, drinking? The girls was out all night last night. Maybe they saw something. You know what I'm saying? Ask 'em. Yeah, now. Yeah. (loud hip hop music) Yo, yo, girls, get off the fucking pole! Come here! Hurry up, come on now! Come on. Shit. (loud hip hop music) Y'all see anything strange out here last night? Huh? Yeah, I saw a guy. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Seemed kinda out of place. Really? Come with me. Come on! Come on, shit. (loud hip hop music) Tell him, tell him what you told me. (loud hip hop music) There was this one white guy, dressed real well, like a businessman, just waiting in his car. I went up to him, but he wasn't there to party. Looked kinda nervous, actually, real intense. Hmm. Hold that. (loud hip hop music) Is that him, is that the man you almost serviced? That's him, definitely. William Duncan.

(dramatic, tense music) What the hell is going on? Some people tried to kill me. What, why? [William] Does it matter? (tense music) You need to call that detective. (tense music) Call. (low, dramatic music) Well, the prints came back. The vic is a Jason Ditman, aka Henley. Henley. How do I know that name? He's one of Rory Fetter's boys. What the hell is going on? (phone beeps) This is Neil Chen. Detective, it's William Duncan. William Duncan. I was just thinking about you. What's up? I need you to come to the house. (low, tense music) Yeah, I'll be right there. Excuse me. You can try to spin this, but I know you killed Danny Fetter. I know why you did it. I honestly don't even blame you. I'm pretty sure that it'll shake out that you killed Henley, too. That dead guy, from like an hour ago? You can give me the silent treatment all you want. There is no other reason why Rory Fetter would be so gung-ho to kill you. You know damn well you started a war. Now you want me to help you. I don't know if I can. Why should I help you? I don't want my wife to get hurt. You should've thought about that before you went and got your revenge. What'd you think was gonna happen? Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Iraq, Afghanistan. Looks like you know how to handle yourself. That was a long time ago. This is where it's at now. You picked a hell of a crew to start a fight with. (door creaks) Got a squad car outside all night. You'll be safe. This is far from over. I'll be back tomorrow with a lot more questions, and I want answers. You're gonna have to start talking to me, or to a judge. (door slams) (siren wails) (dramatic music) (garage door creaks) (tools whir) Nice wheels, goddamn! Well, I figured you'd pay me extra for it. You're funny, you're very funny. (chuckles) No, I'm serious. I'm just so glad you made it, right on time, man. The boat to Sierra Leone is leaving in about 15 minutes. Well, break me off, man. That thing's worth at least 20. Shit, the sticker says 70. I get paid when the boat leaves. (chuckles) I don't get paid, all right. You can still pay me, man. I know you got it. I don't get paid til the fucking car's in the container. - Fuck that. - Come on. I'm not gonna Uber home with nothing. You know what, put some plates on it. I'll drive this fucking thing home. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're not going home with nothing. See, you're not going home with nothing. What's this? [Leader] What it look like? It looks like an insult. Oh, okay, okay. I'll take that Mercedes. It belongs to somebody. So did that. I'm sure that belonged to somebody, too. Please, indulge. That's a lot of fucking money on the street. Looks Chinese. - That's a better market. - Yeah. Fuck. You owe me, man. I know, I know, I know. Thank you very much. [Car Thief] You owe me! (tools whiz) (dramatic music) You're drinking? Yep. You need to tell me what's going on. If you knew, you wouldn't look at me the same way again. William, hey, I love you. You are my husband, and whatever's going on, we are in it together. I feel like I'm right back in the Middle East in a fucking war zone. What are you talking about? You don't wanna know, Jen, you don't. I do. (low, somber music) I killed him. I killed Danny Fetter. (Jen gasps) He took our baby away. He was gonna go away for five to seven years, maximum. It wasn't fair. - William- - It wasn't fair! William, I don't know what you (gasps). And now the rest of them want my head. Well, do we need to leave? Where are we gonna go? Yeah, well, we can't stay here if it's not safe. There's a squad car outside. We'll be fine, but first thing in the morning, go to your folks, at least for tonight. (Jen weeps) And I take it back to the store, and I tell this moron kid like, "Hey, broke again." And this dummy kid says I didn't install it properly and because I, oh shit! (bottle shatters) No fucking way! That prick threw the fucking bottle at us. (siren wails) (car revs) (siren wails) Why did they leave? (William sighs) (door bangs) (Jen screams) [Rory] Hello, hello. (Chuckles) (dramatic music) Don't make that phone call. Give me the phones. Give me the phone! Both of you. Yours. Thank you. Can I call you Bill? William? How about Willy? I don't know, Donnie, whatever you prefer. I like Willy. Yeah. Rory. (Rory chuckles) Don't believe everything you read. I'm a very nice guy. Listen, this is just between you and me. Leave my wife out of it. Jen, go, go- - No, no, no. It's about quality time with family, right, Jennifer? Or Jenny, Jen? Did you know that your husband killed my son? Only because your son killed my daughter. Well, he was my son. Why do you look so angry, William, huh? You're the one who did the killing. Don't be angry. It'll all be over soon. You got the good shit, fancy. We drink cheap shit. I like the gasoline taste. But that's just me. (dramatic music) (gun bangs) - No, goddamn! No, no, no, no, no, sit down. Get down, no, no, no, no, Willy, down on your knees. [William] She had nothing to do with it. Beg for your fucking life. Say hello to my son. (gun bangs) (William gags) (William gags) (dramatic music) Do you see the light, Willy? Is it everything they say it is, huh, huh? I can't wait to celebrate death. For now, I act as its executioner. Fuck you. Mm, that's what you wanna use as your last words? You should enjoy this. (gun bangs) (William wheezes) (Rory giggles) (droning, dramatic music) (ticking, tense music) (William gagging) (phone beeps) (phone rings) [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? (William coughs) Hello? - Help. - Sir? - Help. [Operator] Sir, are you all right? (machinery beeps) (mysterious music) (William grunts) (William groans) Mr. Duncan, oh, God, Mr. Duncan! You're gonna injure yourself. Here, come on. Let's get up, let's get you back in bed, come on. Help, help, help, help, I need some help in here! Oh, easy. Help! - It's okay. Calm down, calm down. - Why? [Nurse] Doctor, Doctor! It's okay, easy, easy. Okay, help me strap him in. He's having a manic episode. Come on, sir. 10 milligrams Haloperidol (speaker cut off by shouting). - Got it! - And get some Ketamine. Breathe with me, come on, sir.

Good start. Sure. [Nurse] One step at a time, there you go. Baby steps, no rush. Good. Somehow, I don't believe you. I don't even think you believe you. There's gonna be a photo with you dead if you keep going. [Nurse] Yeah. There you go. One step at a time. We both know that. It's your choice. (soft, serious music) Okay, looking good. Looking really good, Will. You don't have to lie to me. I'm not lying to you, you're doing great. You're gonna be outta here before you know it. Yeah, that's the plan.

I don't need any help, either. Okay, Willy, all right. You do you. You know what? You know where I can get a gun? Motherfucker, step into my office. Yeah, I had a little run-in myself with them Fetter boys. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Rory, yeah. Motherfucker shot me, yeah, right here, in the shoulder. Three years ago. Motherfucking asshole. Then he killed my fucking cousin. Fuck, man, hate them guys. Yeah, it all comes down to pain and pleasure, my man. Pain and pleasure? Yeah. How much pain you wanna inflict on that fucker, and how much pleasure you want to derive from inflicting said pain. Yeah, be my motherfucking guest. (gun clicks) That's a Glock Nine. You can tell by the sound. That's one of the most reliable stingers on the street. Most cops carry that exact same model right there. That gun's so reliable you could drop that in a pan of pancake batter, lift it up, it'll still bang bang. Not that I would recommend doing that. Yeah, you look like you know what you're doing. Cop, cop, you ain't a cop. You a cop? No, served, long time ago. You kill anybody? I was a marine. So you killed people. I know, shit, you ain't fucking around, huh? No, sir, I am not fucking around. Willy, you can call me Dante. Okay, Dante, I would like to purchase all of your guns and munitions. How much would that cost? Yeah, you're gonna need 'em, man, going up against the Fetter gang. Yeah, they some bad apples, man. So many guns, they have many guns. All right, I'm gonna hook you up. What's that saying? The enemy of my enemy is my friend's enemy, or some shit like that. All right, give me 10 grand for the whole lot. There's 10 right there. Wait a second. (Chuckles) Let me see that. Shit! I should've asked for more money, man. Man, anything else I can get you, rich boy? Nope, not unless you can get me a car. Let me guess, you want one of them cars with no name on it, right? You wanna keep it clean. That would be preferable. (chuckles) Shit, man, I got you covered. You want a sandwich with that, too? (Chuckles) How about the car and the jacket. Man, I love that jacket, man.

Okay, okay, make the call. Make the call. Where's my phone? Fuck. (Groans) Come on, come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We had a fucking deal, man. Please, you don't have to do this. You don't, please. I have a daughter. Fuck. (Pants) Thank you. (low, droning music) Open or closed? What? Your casket. You want it open or closed? (droning music) (gun bangs) (dark, droning music) (dark, droning music continues) (camera clicks) Another one of Fetter's boys. Yep. (camera clicks) Pardon me. (dark, droning music) Detective Neil Chen. Are you Donald Fetter? What are you here for? It seems your son Rory and his friends are in the middle of a little conflict with a gentleman by the name of William Duncan. I know all about William. He killed my son. I thought he died. No, he's very much alive. I think he just killed another one of your son's friends. I'll be blunt. I'm here on a mission of goodwill to end this war, both sides. I just want it to stop. Whatever my son has done, that's his business. I'm not sure I can help. (Neil sighs) You can see yourself out. Sir, I need to speak with your son. I'm not here to arrest him. If I were, I wouldn't be here alone. Why should I trust you? I know who you are, Donnie. I know all about you. Every cop does. And I know that we allow you to do what you do, and I know that that can change. Do you want that to change? (phone beeps) Get your ass in here. [Rory Voice over] Sure. He'll be right in. (low, muffled music) (door clicks) Who the fuck is this guy? [Neil] Rory Fetter, Detective Chen. The fuck do you want? I know all about your war with William Duncan. My war? If I read the papers correctly, William Duncan is deceased. Oh, no, he's not. In fact, he just killed your buddy Zach. - Zach's dead? - Yeah. Shot three times today, just now, in fact. Then why are you here? Why aren't you out chasing this murderer? Don't know where he is. He escaped the hospital. The one that you sent him to when you shot him, murdered his wife. Allegedly. So, you felt that it was a good idea to come to our place of business and tell us that this fuck-face who killed one of my friends is on the loose and you can't catch him? Listen, I'm actually here on a mission of goodwill, 'cause I want this all to end. He's not gonna stop. So I'm here to tell you that maybe you should disappear for a while. Is that all? Yeah, that's all. Enjoy your day. (door clicks) The fuck is this? This guy trying to scare us? I want you to kill that prick. (dramatic music) Get it over with. Go. (dramatic music) Right. (dramatic music) 'Cause I fucking do everything. Right, yeah. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Evening, Detective. (suspenseful music) [Neil] Gun wasn't cheap. You're telling me. (suspenseful music) What the hell are you doing here? You working for them? [Neil] What? [William] You a crooked cop? No, man, I'm trying to fucking help you. I want this to stop, I want all of this to stop. I saw you at the club. I went to tell them about Zach. They deserve to know what happened. How far are you gonna take this? However far it goes, it goes. They took everything from me, and it's only a matter of time before they do it to somebody else. You gotta let this go. Yeah. You know what, I didn't think of that, you're right. I should fucking let it go. Are you even fucking listening to anything I'm saying? Let it go? You know what these people do! - I know. - Yeah, you know. In fact, there have been other initiation murders just like this, and I knew it was them, but nothing ever fucking sticks with these guys. Well, well done, Barney Fife. Doing such a great job of protecting my community! I cannot let you keep going like this. You know that. I'll stop. It'll all be over very soon. But I'm telling you now, if you get in my way, I will fucking kill you. You understand me? Yeah, I understand. Good. Now I don't wanna see you again until this is over. Then I'll turn myself in, I'll go to jail. You can give me the lethal injection. I don't fucking care. But right now, you need to do one thing. You look the other way. (percussive, ominous music) All right. Go and get this over with. Quick. (percussive, foreboding music) Get in here. Sit down. Why are you still here? What? You just asked me to come in here. Go take care of William Duncan. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of him. Just kill him. What the fuck's wrong with you? He's one man. I'll take care of it. Just fucking bounce. Kill the prick. You're my son, goddamn it, act like it for once. I'm your son. Pussy. (pulsing, expectant music) Hey, my brother! You gotta let me in there! My girl is in there! Hell, all my girls. I'm VIP! Oh, let me in, man. (bouncer gags) (low, pulsing music) (loud hip hop music) Shit. You got me. Looks that way. Get it over with. I don't feel anything. I'm serious, Donnie. Nothing. You know, they say the first time is the hardest. When I killed your son Danny, I was emotional. It felt... ...I think the word is visceral. Cathartic. Yes. But now I'm sitting here in front of you. Nothing. Not even a shake. Is this what happens? Is this normal? You tell me. How many people you killed? Hmm, do you remember? How'd it feel when you killed my wife? Enough of this shit. You feel numb then? 'Cause I feel numb at the prospect of killing you. You know, I feel a little disappointed. Just kill me. (dark, droning music) (gun bangs) (people shout) - Hell no! - Shit, man! [Bouncer] Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go! (dark, droning music) Nothing. (dark, droning music) (phone rings) (phone rings) Hey. [William Voice over] Hello, Rory. Who's this? Who do you think? Did you kill him? Yep. Well, then I'm talking to a fucking dead man. You can't kill what's already dead. (low, dark music) (exciting music) Change of plans. Get back to the club. My man. (exciting music) (tires screech) (exciting music) (gun clicks) (exciting music) (pulsing hip hop music) Oh, fuck! Sorry, brother. What are you sorry for? He was a shit father and a despicable human being. But that's not the point. [William Voice over] You can't kill what's already dead, Rory. (droning, suspenseful music) Find him! [Thug] Yeah, let's roll, let's roll. (percussive, suspenseful music) ♪ When the bough breaks ♪ ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby ♪ ♪ Cradle and all ♪ (suspenseful music) (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) (guns bang) (suspenseful music) (bottle shatters) (gun bangs) (thug groans) Fuck, motherfucker! Get off me! [William] I'm walking out with him, Rory! The fuck off me, motherfucker! You're fucking dead. (suspenseful music) I'll fucking kill him! (suspenseful music) So will I. (gun bangs) (thug groans) (guns bang) (tense music) (guns bang) (tense music) (gun bangs) (tense music) (guns bang) (tense, jagged music) (William grunts) (soft, tense music) (car buzzes) (William groans) (William groans) (phone clicks) (William pants) Rory, I saw that guy again. (person knocks) [Dante] Yo, it's me. Come in! You got shot. No shit. [Dante] Where'd they get ya? Shoulder, I can't reach it. Wow, little bit of a problem, huh? Yeah, when you get shot in the back like that, like, hell, what are you gonna do? Come on, stand up. (William groans) Okay, sorry. Can I take a look? Oh, man. Man, that's in there deep. You think you can get it out with these? I ain't no doctor, man. [William] I don't care, just try. Just do it. (ominous music) Anything? [Thug] It's empty. (ominous music) That's the best I can do under the circumstances. (William groans) (ominous music) How are you today, sir? Do you by any chance know who owns that brown car out there? What is the license plate? 4-4-0-6-2. (keyboard clacks) I don't know, it's not in the system. That's okay. Thank you. (gun bangs) Yo, what the fuck, man? He didn't know. (thug sighs) (William groans) Look at that shit. Can I keep this? (jagged music) Willy! Oh, Willy, Willy boy! Who the fuck is that? It's them. They must've followed me. Yeah. [Rory] Oh, Willy! Looks like they brought company, bro. Fucking hell. You're the next contestant on "It's Time to Fucking Die!" (percussive, exciting music) You ready? Yep. All right, here we go. (exciting, percussive music) (gun bangs) (guns bang) Oh, shit! (exciting music) (guns bang) (exciting music) [William] Move out! (guns bang) (exciting music) [Dante] Damn it. [William] Move out!

Go, go, go! (gun bangs) Better not try to shoot out my tires or some shit. You know how much tires are, man? (guns bang) (exciting music) Come on, Willy, come on, Willy! They're fucking expensive, and I know they're 800-fucking-dollars per tire! Let's go, let's fucking do it, let's go! (Laughs) (guns bang) (exciting music) [William] I should've fucking seen her.

Yo, man, you bringing me some noise, man? [Dante] Got no choice, man! They trying to kill my ass! Now, here? Really, man? [Dante] I'm coming in hot, bro. I got you, don't worry about it. (vehicle rumbles) What the fuck is up? That's an old friend. He's gonna take care of us. If we can get there. Listen up, everyone, incoming. Load up. In a few hot seconds, some real bad guys are gonna come up here, so keep your fucking head on a swivel, and stay frosty 'cause a bunch of shit is about to pop the fuck off. (vehicles roar) (exciting music) (Rory laughs) (gun bangs) (Rory laughs) (exciting music) Woo, come on! (exciting music) Fucking A, man, we're doing it! Did we lose them? Oh, fuck me, shit, my ass, damn it! (exciting music) [Roach's Man] Come on, come on! (exciting music) (guns bang) [Rory] Back up, back up!

How many people have to die, Will? You killed my father, Willy, which I don't really blame you. But Danny... Danny I didn't want to die. (gun bangs) (William groans) (dramatic music) I fucking loved him. He wasn't made for this world like you and I. No, no. (William groans) No, you have to stop. It's over now. It's over, Willy. I told you I would get you, and I got you. (tense music) And I got you. (screwdriver squishes) (Rory gags) (discordant music) (Rory groans) (soft, tense music) Got you.
