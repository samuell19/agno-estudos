-So, you got everything? -Yep, Mum, I've got everything. -Yeah? -Yes. Did you take the shea butter for your ashy skin? Mum, I don't have ashy skin, but yes, I did. And I've got coconut oil as well. And I can get some online, so I'll be fine. Ok. Well, give me a hug. Feisty boy. Are you gonna be alright, Mum? Who, me? Yeah. I've got loads to do. I'm so busy. Yeah. I'll text you. Alright then. On WhatsApp. WhatsApp? What's that? Mum, you know how to use WhatsApp. It's on your phone. It's the same as text, like pictures, videos. Oh, yeah, WhatsApp. Yeah, of course. -Love you. -Alright, then. -But phone me, don't use a WhatsApp thing. -Yep. -When you get to the station. -I'll phone you. -Alright, love. Bye. -Bye. Sandra? Sandra? Hmm? Wakey wakey. Do you want a coffee? Oh, yes, please, yeah. How's your Daniel getting on? I'm a bit worried about him, actually Oh, no. Why's that? He's got something called 'Fresher's Flu.' Sandra, that just means he's been drinking too much and shagging around. Maybe I should've bought him some condoms instead of Lemsip. Damn, I wish I went university. Oh, shut up. You get enough of it on that dating app. That's all they ever bloody want on that thing. I wish. Would you be able to help me out with my profile? No! Not if that's what you want it for. I'm sure Daniel will be fine, Sandra. Yeah. I think it's really out of order, to be honest. It depends how much you like him. I like him a lot and you know that. Hey, rich kid! Where you going? Ooh, Mummy got you trombone lessons, did she? -Give it back! -No. -I haven't got any money-- -Yes, you have. Pay up. I've not got any. -Give us your phone, then-- -I've not got any. Please, no! -Hand it now-- -Alright. Hand over the phone-- Give me a minute! -Go on, get out of here. -You're such a weirdo. -What's your problem? -Let's go. Come on, guys, you know you're not supposed to be in here. Out. Oh, for God's sake. Design your avatar. Hmm. They took my phone. They stole my TNs. Why would they do that? Dunno. That's the funniest thing I've seen in my whole entire life. Think fast. Do you mind? Where you going tonight, babe? Home. Why don't you come back to mine? -Nah, I wanna go home-- -Oh, go on, it'll be alright. -Mate, I wanna go home-- -Just come back to mine and have a drink. -No-- -It'll be alright. -I said no! -Come back to mine. She said to leave her alone. What the f-? What are you gonna do about it, eh? Come on, dear. Fancy dress? Something like that. Take her to this address. Don't I know you? You're gonna need these in the morning. Look at that one. -Pow. Pow. -And again. -Pow. Pow. -And again. What the fuck? Snap. She's on the snap. I'm way too high for this shit. There's a hole in the road, you know. Have you been cutting holes in the newspaper? What? No. Here, Sandra, we're all going to the pub tonight. Do you want to come with me ... us? I'll buy you dinner. I can't. I'm sorry. Oh, come on, Sandra. It's karaoke. I need a Spice Girl and Javaughn won't sing. I've got something more important to do. Oh, get shot down, did you, Frederick? Frederick got shot down. Alright. Look, this will cheer you up. I saw this on Saturday. She looks so silly. What you got for me? Nothing. Empty your pockets. What you got for me? I've got something for you. Ow! Crazy cow! Better run. Little girl, I know where you live! Are you ok? Yes. Thank you. Fear not. Here, listen, put yourself in a Travel Lodge for the night. Alright. Go on then. It's round the corner, on the right. What you gonna do now, Superhero? You mean, what are we gonna to do? Yeah, suckers! Time to clean up the streets. Go! Run! Come on. Pub? Pub. Yes! Level complete. What? Mum. Mum, what you doing? Mum, why is Tyrell sending me pictures of you in the street--? Mum?
