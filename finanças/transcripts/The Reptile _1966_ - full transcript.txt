(Knocks) Anyone? Anyone there? Get away from there! Get away! Get away! (Screams) (Groans) (Thunderclaps and lightning) (Bells tolling) Who is it this time, Peter? Who is it? You may well ask. it's Mr Spalding. - Spalding? - Aye. They found him this morning. Just like the others. He won't be the last. You'll see. Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God, in his great mercy, to take unto himself our dear brother, here departed... "And I, Charles Edward Spalding, being of sound mind, "do hereby bequeath all that I possess to my brother, Harry George Spalding, "of Her Majesty's Grenadier Guards, "with such monies and all my personal shareholdings and effects "such to include the cottage I own in the village of Clagmore, Cornwall, England, "known as Larkrise." Well, there we are, then. All very simple and quite straightforward. So, if you are Harry George Spalding of Her Majesty's Grenadier Guards... - You are, aren't you? - Yes, on temporary leave of absence. To settle your brother's affairs? Quite. Well, then, it all goes to you. Don't expect too much, though. Your brother wasn't a rich man. No, not by any means. - Yes, I know. - And his shareholdings... Hmm. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Virtually worthless. Worthless. There is always the cottage, of course. Er... you must realise that this cottage has very limited accommodation. And the er... conveniences aren't... really... Were you thinking of making it a permanent home? - Well, yes, we were. - Oh... When were you thinking of moving in? - Tomorrow. - Really? We're catching the midday train. - Well, then, you'd better have the key. - Thank you. If there is anything else I can do... - There is one thing, sir. - And that is? Have you any idea the cause of my brother's death? - Cause? - When I saw him, he was fit as I am. The report says 'heart failure'. But he was as strong as an ox. Even an ox's heart fails eventually. However, that really isn't my province at all, is it? May I suggest an early visit to his physician to ascertain the facts? - Now once more, my congratulations. - Thank you. - To you both. - Thank you. Oh, what was the address again? - Address? - Of the cottage. - Ah, yes, the cottage... Ah, yes, here it is. Larkrise. That sounds very pleasant. Clagmore Heath, hmm. Cornwall. Here you are. (Harry) Anyone there? Doesn't seem to be anyone around. - That means a walk, I'm afraid. - BREW About two miles. Can you manage? - What about the luggage? - We'll send for it when we're there. All right. But I'm not leaving Katie behind. The place seems deserted. We'll have to find someone to give us directions to the cottage. (Peter) This has become an evil place! Corrupt and evil! Ignorant fools, peasants! Oh... good evening, sir. So sorry, ma'am. - What an extraordinary man. - I'm sure he's harmless. Wait here, darling, I'll ask in the pub. Er, excuse me. Could you direct me to Larkrise Cottage, please? I say, I wonder if... Excuse me, I wonder... Good afternoon, sir. What can I...? Hello, hello, hello. What on earth? Sorry, I seemed to have frightened them away. I can't think why. I can. You're a stranger. They don't like strangers in these parts. I don't exactly know why, but they don't. They're a funny lot. - What can I do for you, sir? - Er, no, thank you. - Looking for accommodation? - No, I have a place. Larkrise Cottage on Mr Spalding's property. Mr Spalding... Yeah, that was very tragic, wasn't it? - You're not a relative, are you? - I'm his brother, actually. Oh, I'm sorry. It was sudden, wasn't it? Well, I'm glad to meet you, Mr Spalding. Tom Bailey is my name. If I can be of any assistance to you... Yes. Could you tell me where the cottage is? Yes, but first have a drink on the house. it's your first time here. No, my wife is waiting outside. You're not thinking of living there permanently, are you? Well, yes, of course. Anything wrong with that? No. But it you take my advice, you'll sell it. You won't get much for it, but sell it and get out. - Why? My brother lived there. - He also died there, Mr Spalding. Yes, I... I know... Your wife will be waiting for you. You'll find the cottage if you go to the bottom of the village and turn left. It’s about a mile, straight across the moor., - (Harry) There it is. - Why, it's lovely. It's so peaceful. (Harry) A Spalding home for many years to come. - I'm glad you like it. - it's what I've always dreamed of. I'm sure you've dreamed of something much grander, my dear. - But thanks very much for saying so. - Not at all. My tastes are very simple. So you said! Look, roses round the door, a brand-new wife... What more could a man want? Ah! - Oh! - it's tradition, my darling, relax! I insist! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Looks like we've got some work to do. Come on. (J Traditional sea shanty) (Singing peters out) Somebody's deliberately wrecked my brother's cottage. I'm a stranger here, I don't expect to be made welcome. But I do expect to be able to prove myself before being judged an enemy. If any of you had a quarrel with my brother and wants to take it out on me, come right out and say so and we'll settle it in a manner we all understand. Well? Which one of you did it? Mr Spalding, I've got your luggage. Old Garnsey brought it down for you. I'm sure you'd like to buy him a drink for his trouble. - You won't refuse him, will you? - None of us touched your cottage. - Then who did? - I don't know who did. I'm only telling you it were none of us. I don't drink with people who accuse me of things I haven't done! Sorry. Well, you've emptied my pub again, haven't you? I think you'd better buy a drink for yourself before you bankrupt me. - You warned me, didn't you? - Yes, I warned you. I might just as well as saved my breath. You're like your brother, obstinate. I don’t like to be beaten It didn't do him much good. You expect me to pack up and go without showing any fight? I don't expect anything. Just be careful. Very careful. Better have one yourself. Thanks. I will. (Footsteps) Harry? (Gasps) Who are you? I'm sorry if I startled you. My name is Franklyn, Dr Franklyn. Mine is the large house you may have noticed across the moor, - No, we hadn’t. - No matter. It is of no importance, I am looking for someone, Mrs Spalding. - Have you seen anyone? - No, no one. Dr Franklyn! I've just told you that I've seen no one. - By what right do you...? - Excuse me, please! Unfortunately it has not been my experience that everyone invariably tells the truth. Even my own daughter sometimes lies to me. - Is it your daughter you're looking for? - I regret to say it is. - She is a great burden to me. - If I see her, I'll tell her you seek her. She will know that. If you will excuse me... Dr Franklyn, how did you know my name? My husband and I only arrived here a few hours ago. Although I am not active in the life of the village, I know what goes on. Did you know my husbands brother, Charles Spalding? No. No, I did not. - He died a few weeks ago. - I am aware of that. Do you happen to know what he died of, Doctor? - I do not. - I thought perhaps he was your patient. - Patient? - That you were his doctor. No, Mrs Spalding, I was not his doctor. Good night. We shall meet again, no doubt. Thanks for the loan of the cart Mr Bailey. - Tom's the name. - And for provisions. That's all right. You can't live on fresh air. - Though you'll get plenty of it up there! - Well, I'll be on my way. Don't leave that wife of yours alone too long. - Thanks, Tom. Bye! - Goodnight. What's the matter, boy? (Horse snorts) Whoa, boy. - Let go of me this instant! - Let go of you? What? How dare you set upon me like that! You might've killed me. - I might've killed you? - Or broken a bone at least. My bones are very fragile, they break very easily. Tell me who are you and why you attacked me! Oh, I should be asking that of you. Ah, but then I know who you are, don't I? You're Spalding's brother. The one they killed. My name's Crockford, Peter Crockford. How do you do? They call me Mad Peter. Oh, only because I don't conform. What do you mean, "they killed my brother"? - Didn't you know he was dead? - Yes, I did know. - I knew and I'm not his brother... - I did know! - Very surprised. - Tell me, who are they? They? Didn't you hear them just now? Listen... Shh! You'll hear them again. Shh! Quiet. (Silence) Funny, they were here a moment ago. - Now look, Mr Crockford! - Look? There's nothing to see, only to hear. (Groans) Oh, I think I have broken something, you know. You really had no right to go scuffling about in the dark like that! (Moans) You don't happen to have a drop of whisky on you, do you? - I don't usually carry it around with me. - Medicinal, you know. No? A cup of coffee, hmm? - Come on. - Oh, my hat. - Thank you. - You may as well be our first guest. - Guest? - With my wife and I, for supper. Supper? How perfectly delicious! I hate to tell you how long ago it is since I ate. May l? (Belches) Granted. Well, Mr Crockford? Ah, much better, thanks. (Sighs heavily) We're, er... We're waiting. Waiting? Ah, waiting... Aren't we all? We're waiting for a explanation. And with every right. Any more delicious coffee? Not till he's told us something. Yes... Yes, you've a right to know. Every right. Excuse me a moment. May I please tell you something about myself? It may not be of any interest but may help to convince you that what I'm about to say is the truth and no figment of my imagination. - May I? - Please. Thank you. I'm not mad, you know. They call me Mad Peter because I find it difficult to grasp some important things... ...like being able to make money. No, I'm not mad... just a little vague and sensitive. This is an evil place! Corrupt and evil! I can feel it taking the goodness from me. It hasn't always been so. When I came here 10... 15... Was it 20 years ago? It was a good place. The people were kind and gentle. As God willed they should be. And then... And then... they came, bringing their vileness with them. Who came? Are you all right, Mr Crockford? Listen! (J Faint oriental music) - I can't hear anything. - Listen, damn you! Oh, damn, damn, damn! What is it? - Can't you hear it, woman? - (Harry) Yes, I can hear it now. What does it mean? - It means death. - Death? - I heard it the night your brother died. - You what? I heard it that night, the night your brother died! Oh, god! - You can't go until you tell me! - I must! I must! (J Oriental music stops) What on earth do you make of that? I'm frightened. - Harry... - it's all right, darling, it's all right. Look, we can leave here if you like, right away. No. This is our home and we're staying. But promise me one thing. You will never leave me here on my own. (J Faint strains of oriental music) (Footsteps) (Knock) What is it, darling? I don't know. I thought I heard something. (Moaning and gasping) What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Come in. Come on, let me get you inside. (Groaning) - Who is it? - it's Peter! (Raving) (Muttering) I'll try and get a doctor. Get some water quickly. (Peter) Doctor! Ah, doctor... (Screams) (Manic raving) (M utters) Doctor... Doctor... Fran... - What's he trying to say? - Doctor Franklyn. - The man I told you about. - Where does he live? - He said the big house across the moor. - I know the one. I'll go and get him. (Muttering) Dr Franklyn? - Dr Franklyn... - What are you doing here? - What do you want? - There's a man dying at my house. - Would you come quickly, please? - What is that to do with me? Perhaps I didn't make myself quite clear. You made yourself perfectly clear. There's a man dying at your house. I repeat, what is that to do with me? You're a doctor, aren't you? Yes, I am a doctor of theology not of medicine. I'm afraid I can be of little help to you in your trouble. Could you look at him? I know nothing about medicine. Very well. But you must clearly understand that my knowledge is also limited. We're too late. Have you any idea what could have caused it? He was an epileptic. Obviously he had a seizure. But the colour of his face, the swelling. I have told you, I am not a doctor of medicine! I only know the man was subject to fits and suggest this was one. But surely this... Please do not force me to express opinions I am not qualified to give. Leave it to me to make all the arrangements. Thank you. I shall not wish you a good night as you're scarcely likely to have one after your experience. But I will express my regret that your arrival here should have been so... ...unpleasant Mrs Spalding. Sir. We can't leave him here. No, you're right. - I'll put him outside in the yard. - But... What else can I do? Doesn't make any difference to him, poor fellow. You go upstairs. I won't be long. (Bird shrieking) "We therefore commit his body to the ground, "earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, "in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life "through our lord Jesus Christ. Amen." Surely he must've had some friends other than yourself, Mr Bailey? - Yes, ma'am. He had many friends. - Why aren't they all here? - They wouldn’t come here, ma’am. - Oh? Why not? - Because of what he died of. - But what did he die of? - There's no doctor here to tell us. - No, there's no doctor. The coroner comes once a month, he won't ask too many questions. He'll say he died of heart failure. But they will say he died of the Black Death. - What on earth is the Black Death? - That's what people round here call it. I'm not a doctor, I don't really understand the details. Poor old Peter. I shall miss him, for one. Well, it's all over now. Are you in a hurry? - Well, I'm afraid I am. - Would you like a drink? Thank you, but I must get back to prepare Harry's dinner. But you stay, darling. - Thanks. I won't be long. - Would you like to take the trap? - It's all right. - You sure? Yes, of course, I shall enjoy the walk. - Go on through to the parlour. - Thank you. - Can I get you a brandy? - Thank you. Tom, how many people have died by this Black Death before my brother? A few. What do you think killed them? - What do you mean? - Tom, I'm a professional soldier, I've knocked about the world, I've seen many strange things. Things I couldn't even fathom for myself. Just because I didn't understand them, it doesn't necessarily mean there isn't a perfectly logical explanation for them. And I'm sure you'll agree with me that there must be a perfectly logical explanation for all this. Mr Spalding, I was a professional Seaman. And I too have knocked around the world a bit. I've seen things that your logic could not explain away. You mean they died by some sort of... magic? Some witchcraft? I don't know. And I don't intend to try to find out. How well did you know my brother? Fairly well. - Did you like him? - Yes, I liked him. He was the sort of man who kept himself pretty much to himself, but what I knew of him I liked. And Mad Peter? Everyone liked Mad Peter. And yet you don't care how they died. Oh, yes, I do care, Mr Spalding. But I also care about myself. When I was at sea, I used to dream about having a little place like this. And now I've got it, I want to keep it! I want to spend the rest of my days here and die here in my bed! Not be found out there on the moor. You mean you're frightened? Yes... I’m frightened. For the first time in my life, I am frightened. Sorry, I... I shouldn't have said that. You have every right to say it. I would like to help you, but... But I'm on my own, huh? Oh! How cruel. Who are you? I do apologise. I was hoping to get finished before you got back. It was meant to be a sort of welcome. - Well, the door was open. - How very kind of you. I heard about your terrible experience last night, and I thought that these might help take away an unhappy memory. They will, of course, but... Who are you? - I'm Anna Franklyn. - Oh, yes, I've met your father. - Yes, I know. - He was searching for you last night. I hope he wasn't too furious when he found you. - No. - Good. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'm Valerie Spalding, as I expect you know. Everyone seems to know about us here. Coffee? Yes, please. (Valerie) The flowers are really beautiful. My father grows them. - He must be very clever. - Yes, he is clever. - But a little frightening. - What do you mean? Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I just meant that... Well, I found him almost intimidating. But he was... - He was a very good man. - Was? I mean he is good. Yes, of course, I'm sure he is. Well... the coffee. - Mrs Spalding, may I ask you a favour? - Yes, of course. Will you and your husband have dinner with us tonight? - That's hardly asking a favour of me. - No, please, say yes, say you'll come. Of course, we'd be delighted. My father will be there. We'd still be delighted. Perhaps we could get to know him better. Yes. Yes, that would be good. - Thank you, Mrs Spalding. - it's I who have to thank you. - Can I do anything to help? - If you'd fetch some water... The pump's in the front yard. Through the sitting room. Mrs Spalding, I must go. - Why, what's the matter? - it's nothing, but I must go. - If you have to, but is anything wrong? - No, it's just that... I'm very sorry, but please call again if you can. - What are you doing here, Anna? - I'm sorry, Father. You did not have my permission to come here. Surely, Anna does not need your permission to pay a neighbourly call? Please do not interfere in matters you do not understand, Mrs Spalding. - Father, please. - Anna! I'm sorry, Father. I realise the image I have created of myself, Mrs Spalding. But believe me, things are neither as simple nor straightforward as they seem. I'm sorry, it was not my place to speak as I did. I'm not really an ogre, Mrs Spalding. I'm glad to hear it, if we're to have the pleasure of dining with you tonight. Please, Father. Until tonight, Mrs Spalding. Come, Anna. You find it too hot in here? I am used to it. In fact, I need it. Anna and I spent so much of our lives in the hot climates. Wherever I travelled, Anna was always at my side. India, Java, Borneo, Sumatra. Never complaining, she was always helpful. It was necessary for my work, you understand. My research into the primitive religions of the East. - A little more wine, Mrs Spalding? - Perhaps I'd better not. Oh, just a little won't harm you. You must have found your travels very interesting, Dr Franklyn. - Mr Spalding? - Thank you. Yes, indeed. But more than interesting, fascinating... horrifying. - Are you ready for dinner? - Oh, thank you. - Is Anna not joining us? - No. Oh, I'm sorry. I hope she's not unwell. She's being punished. I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping to make her acquaintance. I trust you enjoy the subtle flavour of oriental foods, Mrs Spalding. Well, I don't think I've ever tasted any. If they're as good as your wine... - Sit here, Mrs Spalding. - Thank you. Anna? Please sit down. - You may join us now. - Thank you, Father. - Hello, Anna. - Mrs Spalding. Anna, may I introduce my husband? Harry, this is Anna Franklyn. - We almost met. - Very happy to meet you. Anna, perhaps you'd like to show Mrs Spalding your pets? - Your pets, Anna. - Perhaps Mrs Spalding isn't interested. - Are you interested in animals? - Why, yes, I love them. Anna would be delighted to show you her little collection. Of course. Please. A cigar? Er, no, thank you. Mr Spalding, may I speak quite frankly? (Birds cooing) These are my pets. They're beautiful, but so many. - I love animals. - I can see you do. Why are they all locked up? Locked up... Is anything wrong, Anna? There's something I must tell you while I have the chance. My father will try to make you leave the cottage. You mustn't leave. Please. You mustn't leave. I've no intention of leaving, Dr Franklyn. I see. And there is nothing I can say to persuade you? Nothing you've said so far can persuade me. Very well. But if anything unpleasant should occur... Such as? If something unpleasant should occur, please remember what I have said. Anna! Why don't you play something for our guests? Anna is an accomplished musician. Quite brilliant, in fact. Aren't you, Anna? She's shy. - Do you like music, Mr Spalding? - Well, I like a good tune, yes. "A good tune." Well, we shall have to see what we can do. Won't we, Anna? (J Traditional Indian music) (J Tempo becomes more intense) Stop! Get out! Get out of my sight! Dr Franklyn, I know this is not my place to interfere... Then please don’t. We're leaving, Valerie. Good night. (Anna) Oh! Please. Oh, please give it to me. Please! (Kitten miaows) Katie? Katie? Katie, Katie, Katie! - No sign of her? - None. I don't understand it, how could she have got away? She couldn't have got out, if the doors are locked. Still, they were locked once before. When we first arrived, someone still broke in. Harry, what is happening? I don't know, but I intend to stay and find out. - Are you of the same mind? - About staying? Of course. Nobody's going to frighten us away. I do hope poor little Katie's all right. I’ve left the door ajar. She can't be far away. - Pack your things, we're leaving! - No, doctor, Dr Franklyn. You are not leaving. You will not leave until I say you can leave. - What is to stop me? - You Know what is to stop you. I could kill you. Possibly. But you could never be free then, could you? You will be punished to the end of your miserable life. And what would happen to little Anna then? Good night, Anna. Whoa! - Mr Bailey. - Good morning, Mrs Spalding. - How nice to see you. Do come in. - Thank you. Harry, it's Mr Bailey! I brought a few more things you might be needing. - How very kind of you. - Hello, Tom. What's all this? It's a sort of welcome present to you both. I was going to cook breakfast. Would you have some with us? Thank you very much, I would. I won't be a moment, I'll finish dressing. Mr Spalding, I didn't only come here this morning to bring these things. - I came to admit that I was wrong. - You're going to help me? - Yes. - Eggs and bacon? Oh, yes, thank you. - How do we start? - Can you come over to mine tonight? Well, I promised Val I wouldn't leave her on her own. - But I'll see. - Do your best. Get there if you can. Would you lay the table, please, darling? - What time? - Any time after dark. - As late as possible. - All right. I'll just finish dressing. Erm... - What is it, Tom? - Glad you could come. Not without a struggle. Valerie wanted to come too. Just as well she didn't. Come in. - But I... - He's quite dead. I dug him up. - What? - Just now. And I said you were frightened. Oh, I've seen too many dead 'uns to be afraid of him. Why? Why? Why dig him up, you mean? Because I wanted to have a look at him. Give me a hand. Now look there. What do you make of it? - It looks like a bite. - it's two bites, isn't it? I Perhaps an animal with two teeth, fangs. It's possible. - You know what I think we should do? - What? Have a look at your brother. I'll fill this in, you go and start on your brother's grave. There's a spade up against the wall there. (Scratching) Sorry, old lad. I won't disturb you again. Look. The marks are the same. Did you ever see anything like that before? Yes, once. In India. - A man bitten by a king cobra. - So have I! - But in England, this is impossible. - But it all fits, doesn't it? The colour of the face, the foam on the mouth. - it's unbelievable. - But it's true. I’m sorry we had to do this Mr Spalding. We don't you go home? Your wife's alone, isn't she? - Yes. - I'll clear up here. I'll come and see you in the morning. Yes. - Who is it? - (Harry) it's all right, it's only me. - Thank goodness! - Were you frightened? Scared stiff. - Look, let me help you. - Thank you. Go and sit by the fire and get warm. I've got the kettle on, I'll make some tea. Thank you, darling. Oh, by the way, this was pushed through the door. It's addressed to you. "For God's sake, help me. "An na." (Footsteps) I'll try to get her away from there, bring her back here. Harry! It will be all right. (Birds cooing) (Cat miaows) Anna? Anna? (Shrieking) Get away! (Screams) (Shrieking and hissing) (Harry groaning) (Groaning) (Gasping) Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Quick! - Darling, what's happened? - Get a knife! Get a knife! Quickly... (Groaning) Quickly! Cut it! Cut... Cut it deep... deep! (Mutters deliriously) Come on. Come on, darling. Let me get you upstairs. (Gasping) You realise what you have done? He may be alive because of your foolishness. I hope to God he is. What will happen to you and to Anna, when he goes to the police? I don't care anymore. You will care. For God's sake, let me alone. No, I will not leave you alone, Dr Franklyn. You should have thought of that before you started meddling in things that do not concern you. No, I will not leave you alone. And you will do as I tell you. Do you hear me? I said, do you hear me, Doctor? Yes. You will find out if he is dead or not. How can I? - By going and asking. How else? And what if he is still alive? Tom! Tom! Help me, please! Is that you, Mrs Spalding? Yes, Tom. I need your help. I'll come straight down. (Gasping and moaning) Anna! Anna! Anna... (Maniacal screams) (Screams) Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Harry, darling! Sorry, lad. Just want to have a look. What was it, Tom? What can have happened? Whatever it was, he seems to be over the worst of it. He looked ghastly. (Footsteps) - Your friend, Dr Franklyn. - Dr Franklyn? Leave him to me. (Knocking) Oh... I wish to speak to Mr Spalding! I'm afraid you're too late, Doctor. He died an hour ago. I'm sorry. I would like to express my condolences to Mrs Spalding... I shouldn't come in, if I were you. He died of the Black Death. I'll give your message to Mrs Spalding. Thank you. Tom? - Are you all right? - Hmm. It might be better if we leave him alone for a bit. We'll hear him if he calls. Come on. You should take it easy for a bit. Sit down here. Put your feet up. I'll put on the kettle. Tell me all about it. - What made him go up there? - To the house? Yes, why? There was a note pushed under the door, addressed to Harry. - it's here somewhere. - Don't try to find it. - Who was it from? What did it say? - It was Anna Franklyn. - She was asking for help. - Anna? (Unintelligible chanting) The last thing I remember, I went upstairs... That's all. Did you see Anna? I don't know. I don't know... Don't worry, darling. You should rest again now. Here, drink this. - Thanks, Tom. - I've got one for you downstairs. Thank you. Sorry to leave you, Mrs Spalding, but I'll have to open up the pub, or I might lose my license. - I'll be back later, though. - There's no need, he'll be all right. It's you I'm thinking of now. Don't forget to drink that cocoa. Thank you. There's something in it to help you relax. Quite harmless. Thank you, Tom. You've been very kind. - I'll be back. - Goodbye. Anna? Anna? Oh, God! (Miaowing) (Miaows) (Screams) (Shrieks) (Screams) I'm sorry, Mrs Spalding. Before I leave this house, I must tell you about Anna. She lies down there, in the cavern. That vile thing underneath that blanket is my daughter Anna! Oh, not the Anna you know, not that lovely girl. Not that lovely girl, but a hideous parody of herself! A loathsome thing... using her body! My daughter! My lovely Anna! But for you, I would have released her from her misery! You! (Screams) No! You're not leaving! She was my only happiness. My dearest possession. And they knew that was the way to punish me. I told you of the years I spent in the East, investigating their primitive religions. There was particular religious cult that kept evading me, Mrs Spalding. Like the Leopard People of Africa, this was a secret society, and their secret jealousy guarded. The Ourang Sancto, the Snake People. Very few people have heard of it outside Borneo, and there they never dare speak of it. It took a long time and a great deal of patience to discover their secret. But I managed it and returned to Singapore to write up my investigations. A few weeks later, Anna disappeared. It is not unusual in Malaya and I waited the ransom note from Chinese bandits. None came. Three weeks later, she was returned unhurt and apparently with no idea of what had happened to her. And then... it all began, Mrs Spalding They had their revenge. Anna was one of them. As soon as I realised, I got her as far away from their influence as possible. I brought her here in the hope that it would weaken their hold and because the sulphur streams could keep her warm in the winter. You see, every winter Anna sheds her skin like a reptile, and goes into a deep sleep. The cold would kill her. It was useless. They followed me here, Mrs Spalding. I was not allowed a moment's peace. And wherever we go, they will still follow us. The fire! Fire? Yes, it will keep her warm. - It will warm her... - Let me out! No! You must stay! (Knocking) Valerie? Mrs Spalding? Valerie! Help! Help! Help, please! Help! There is no one to hear you. Please, you can't leave me here, you can't! (Sobbing) You can't leave me here! You can't! (Screams) (Valerie) Open the door, please! Help! Help! (Screams) (Hisses) (Hisses) (Groans) Help! Help! (Coughing) (Key turning in lock) (Screams) (Valerie gasps) (Screams) (Creature moans) it's cold. Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Oh... oh... Get out through the hall! (Miaowing) - The kitten! - Valerie, don't! Don't be a fool! Come on!
