Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Relax. Take it softly. - Understand? - Yes. Look. Watch me. Runa. - Africa? - Yes. I haven't seen you in such a long time, and you're leaving so soon. The rector and I will be spreading the faith. - I'll probably never return to Japan. - I see. Can I stay with you until I leave? If you think I'll be in the way, I can find somewhere else to stay. Of course you won't be in the way. But have you forgotten what happened three years ago? I stole your lover. Keigo. I hated you for it at the time, sure... but religion has changed me. Then I'm forgiven? We're sisters. Half-sisters. We have different fathers. Sis. Yes? How is Keigo doing? Why don't you marry him? Well, a lot has happened, you know. I didn't know you two were like this. Anyway, I've brought good news for both of you. Oh? There's some land. Why don't you buy it? It's Keigo's business, isn't it? Tell me all about it. He's been depressed because real estate is so dull lately. Maybe that's why we're avoiding each other. We're really in love. We want to get married. You've run up quite a tab. What are you going to do? It's nice to have you come around and drink- if you pay. Now it's my responsibility. I'm in trouble. I know. I know just how it is. You can't fool me! Since when are you my wife? Aoi Real Estate. You? Don't call me anymore. We're through- permanently. You sound like a great lover. You're strapped. I know that. I'm calling you on business. If you want money, listen to what I have to say. I can't tell you much about it now. I heard about it from Runa. Runa? Yes. She suddenly came back. So you made your peace with her, huh? Look, I'm busy right now. Let's say I drop over to your apartment tomorrow, okay? I got it. What's that sound I hear? Anyway, that's how it is. I'll let you hear about it from Runa directly. Bye. Keigo's eager to see you. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name... thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Do you pray every day? Every morning and evening. Your calligraphy is so beautiful. Where did you find that? In the kitchen. It's a stray. It's filthy. It's cute. You're too much. - Why don't you take a bath? - After you. Don't be so formal. If you insist. You're late! Long time no see, huh? Looks like you put on a little weight. Listen. This is my deal, so I'm taking the lead. So don't act big. And another thing- don't let Runa know. Not a word. We're supposed to be in love. We're gonna get married. Got it? Look, how do I know it's for real? You can make 10, 20 million yen. Really? Runa was born stupid, and she got worse in the goddamn convent. - Meet her. Talk to her. - Mayumi. I have to go to work. Or so I told her. - To raise some cash? - The more we invest, the more we make. I'll mortgage the school. I've got a few bills to collect. Do what you can, huh? Bye. Runa. It's been a long time. Come in. Did Sis tell you about it? Yeah, but it doesn't sound too attractive. I came here to apologize. It's over. Forget about it. Ten years ago, our order bought about 10 hectares. God sent us there. We did our best. Our mission was successful. We've decided to sell the land... and move on to spread the word of the Lord. I told the rector about you. But- Our order is not interested in worldly gain. You can acquire the land for what we paid for it. You can make a profit and use that to get married. Keigo, make my sister happy. Runa, your being a nun- I drove you to it. No. You caused me to find God. I'm sorry. But by finding God, I also found the devil. No! Don't! Stop! Patience, child. No! Rector. Don't. Stop! No! No! Help! Did it hurt? I doubt it. It felt good. Which part did you like the best, huh? - Tell me! - No, no, no. Where? Where did it feel the best? Tell me. Where? Help. No, no! Tell me. My lips- Some nun you are! The harsher the punishment you expect, the greater your pleasure. Isn't religion wonderful? Be more tender. Yes. It's so nice- What's wrong? What are you thinking about? About you and Sis. We've been worried about you the past three years. Kitajima. Sorry I'm late. How are the ratings of your new show? Later. What's all this good news? At last we'll be able to get married. Mayumi! I'm happy too. But before we can do it, I need two million yen. My father's back in town again. He wants me to raise some money for him. His factory's almost bankrupt. ''Quit squeezing money out of me,'' I told him. ''I can't get married because of you!'' But we settled it. It's the last time. He'll never see me again. I'll finally be free. Don't you believe me? Yes, I do. But I heard rumors that you've been with lots of guys. What? You believe those rumors before me? No, no! Mayumi! Don't go! Mayumi! If you refuse to believe me, I can't go on living! I know. I understand. Here. What is this? It's me. I was so ashamed of doing this. I want you to know that. Uh-huh. Can I borrow some money from you? Why not, now that I know you love me. For you, I'd do just about anything. Thank you. I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life. Mayumi, are you free this evening? Not tonight, I'm afraid. My sister is here from Hokkaido. Ouch. Don't do that. Good kitty. So what's on your mind? My share. I want to settle on my cut before I go to Hokkaido. Keigo. I told you I'd handle it. I'm putting up some of the capital. I ran around all day today borrowing money. I didn't tell you to. We ought to buy all the land, not just part. I don't want anybody else in on it. How greedy. I'll take 40%. We'll split it 40-60. Like hell we will! You get 20. Not a point more. Think you can do it without me? Runa's still nuts about me. How conceited can you get? She's just worried about me. Thanks. Mayumi. You want me to drop out? You'll be finished. What are you doing? Trying to be more friendly. Stop it! Keigo, stop. I wasn't looking for this. - Stop. - What's wrong with it? - Don't do this. - I love you. - No! - Don't move! Keigo, stop! If you think this is going to get you 40%, you're wrong. Don't be so mean. You won't miss 40. - Twenty. I said 20. - Come on! Twenty. I said 20. This is the first time since we were in Nagasaki. No! Keigo, you ass! Stop it! Keigo, stop. You mean go ahead. No. Stop it. You remember, huh? How nice it was? I know you like it. No! No! Stop! Forty-six, okay? Say it's okay. Come on! I've raised this with Keigo. I didn't mean you had to do it so suddenly. It's all right. Keigo says he'll get a better office and expand his business. I'll finally be able to marry him. Thanks to you. Hello. Keigo. We were just talking about you. How's Hokkaido? Really? Good. The rector showed him around. What's next? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I see. Take care on the way back. Bye. - It's good land. He's excited. - That's nice. - He's flying back tonight. - What about the rector? He'll be here day after tomorrow. He'll sign over the deed and send the money to the diocese. And the day after that, he'll leave by plane. - Runa. - Yes? I must do something to thank you. Don't bother. I don't know when we'll ever meet again. Then just lend me a dress, just for today. - A dress? - Yes. CHRISTMAS SALE I'm not supposed to wear anything but a habit. Our order is especially strict about it. Then why do you want to wear a dress? Maybe because I just feel like taking a day off from God. I must say, that dress becomes you. Runa, I hope you don't change your mind about going to Africa. Why? I don't know. I just- - I'm going. - I see. Let's try it again. Who? Who are you? They're all here, yes. Well, can you give me your name? Hello? Hello? It was that woman again. I know why you were told to come here. You know Mayumi, don't you? Mayumi? You mean Mayumi Kotani? You know her? I ought to. She's my fiancee Bullshit! She's gonna marry me. The hell she is! Mayumi's mine! Don't be absurd. Wait. Look. Mayumi is going to marry me. You want proof? I'll show you. She made it herself. I've got one of those too. You too? - It can't be! - Look! It's a fake! She duped you all. She made a fool of me. I gave her two million yen only this morning. So did I. She hooked me for 1 ,800,000. - 2,500,000 for me. - 1 50,000. Two million yen for a pussy print? I can't believe it. That dirty rotten bitch. Get back at her! Do something! I'm not very lucky today. You're late. - More good news. - Oh? There's a redevelopment project going on up there. The land's worth more than we thought. Really? That's it! Game. Good. That doubles the score. This wine is from the rector. He said we should get married before he leaves Japan. He wants to attend the wedding. How nice. Let's drink to it. Cheers! Cheers! We'll have to be a good couple, or Runa will be disappointed. - Right, Keigo? - Right. The whole thing- it's all thanks to Runa. Runa, what's wrong? Hello. Speaking. No, not now. Well, it's trouble, but all right. Where do you want to meet? Very well. I'll be there in time for the lessons. One of the instructors is sick. I have to fill in. just my luck. TELEVISION STATION Kitajima! Kitajima! Stop playing games. Mayumi, I love you. Let's get married right now. -I'm first! -No, I'm first! - Me! - Not you! Me! Help! That's enough. No. You don't get along with Sis, do you, Keigo? - You hate each other. - We're in love. No. It shows. I saw it from the beginning. Runa, we're in love. But what's the point? Why bring it up? Because I love you. I haven't forgotten you, not for a single day. I'd gladly betray God for you. Runa! Please. Leave Japan with me. I have a friend in Brazil. Let's live there,just the two of us. Stop it! Stop! Hey, don't rush me. Make it snappy. I can't wait. I'll come. Shut up. They'll hear. Stop! Will you quit pushin'! You're number three. Don't try to cut in. What are you talking about? I lost more than you. So what? This is no time to discuss it. Wait your turn. I'm through. Next sucker. I'm next. Step aside. - And I'm after you. Remember that. - No, I'm next. You wait. Hell, she'll be pumped full. Don't do that! - Please! - Stop! I can't wait any longer. No! Stop it! God, you're slow. Take it easy. I can't wait. Here! Ouch. Hey, hold her still! Hold still! You go over there, and I'll do it here. - You've already had her. - The hell I did. I'm done. It's your turn. At last. Wait- Welcome back. Where's Keigo? He went to get the contract ready. You look tired. I was teaching. I was at it for four hours. Sis. Congratulations on your marriage. Thanks, Runa. Ouch. Runa. The rector's coming tomorrow, right? You're going away. You need to watch your health. You too. I want you to be happy. Runa. I'll always remember you. You too. I appreciate your kindness. No, it's God's will. All I did was transfer the deed. My sister meant to come for you, but she has a headache. That's too bad. She'll be all right. Where's Keigo? He'll meet us at my apartment. Come in. I'm afraid it's in a mess. Runa, the rector is here. Thief! Get her. She's at the airport. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Going to Africa was a lie? Runa and I planned to escape to Brazil with the money. Apparently something went wrong. Then the land- - It belongs to someone else. - What? Keigo. Keigo! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? The money's gone! Where is it? Stop! - Where is the money? - Don't do that! Shut up! - Stop! - Where is it? I promised Runa I'd run away to Brazil with her. Stop hitting me! Yuki. - Did it work? - Sure. Solid money. You don't regret it? Why should I? Now I can be with you. We'll have a real good time. What's this? This is nice. Can I touch it? What are you gonna use it for? Shooting kangaroos. Kangaroos? The poor things. Some of them are protected, but almost all of them are bad. just like human beings. Right on. God, it's cold. What are you going to Australia for? Anywhere will do. Yeah? We're looking for an illusion. An illusion? What kind of animal is that? Can I shoot it with a gun? Shoot it! Shoot it! He threatened me with the gun! He's awful! Stand beside her. Do it, or he'll shoot you. THE END
