Why, Fiona. [ Crying ] I need your opinion. I booked a gig in Vegas... except it's a year contract, and my boyfriend doesn't want me to go. Excuse me, Fiona. Jerry, I got a lot to say. He thinks if I leave, I'll meet somebody else. Which is a possibility. They want to send me to one of those leper colonies. Just a skin disease, but what are you gonna do ? Your glasses are dirty. I love him, but this is such a great opportunity for me. The choreographer's amazing, and the money's really good. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. Mel, what were you trying to say ? Nah, nah. You think I'm gonna tell you now ? Forget it, Jerry. Let's go. [ Cheering ] Clyde's not as uptight as you are, Henry.

Get the skankiest bitch you can find. A broke, cracked-out Madonna lookin' bitch. [ Indistinct Arguing ] [ Connie ] It's not your fault she can't please her man. Don't be wastin' your time with that trash. You need to be kickin' his ass. Don't have him come here and embarrass you, girl. We got a "I Slept with My Stepdaddy" fighting with "My Traitor Girlfriends." I'll be right back. Take care of yourself. [ Arguing ] Break it up. Stop that. That's enough. That is totally unacceptable. All right ? Just calm down. Save it for the show, okay ? Unacceptable. [ Natalie ] Exactly what we need. That's great, but let's get back to the conference room. Come on, guys, let's go. I'll get your ass, bitch. You gonna get it. [ Natalie ] I need you back in here. Messin' up your hair and all that. I ain't tryin' to mess up my hair.

He said he wanted to see my true love. Can't you show him a picture ? Because it's all about the whole thing. You always showin' you ass. Can't you keep your clothes on ? Always callin' me a slut. Who's the slut ? I ain't no slut. I just showed my tattoo. At least I keep my stuff in the house. It's in the house ! Not all in the elevator and shit. It look good. My ass ! Look ass ! This ass ! Yeah, yeah. Do it again. Let's go out. I can't watch your show. I have to turn the channel after a few seconds. Why ? I find it bleak and depressing. I'm sorry, that's just how I feel. Don't you find it bleak and depressing ? Sure I do. You don't think I'm some horrible elitist ? I don't find you horrible. Catherine, just about every guest I've dealt with... has been decent and kind and poor. I think you find poverty bleak and depressing, and our show reminds you that it exists. Thanks for coming by. We appreciate it. [ Explosion On TV ] It ain't right. It just ain't-- I ain't doin' it. It don't matter. They're gonna make you do it. The hell they will. Please don't go. It ain't right goin' on TV tellin' the whole world... about parts of our lives that people ain't got no business knowin'. You should have thought about that before comin' here. - You're doin' the show. - No, I ain't. - Don't do this to me, Rusty. - I ain't doing nothin' to you ! You fuck my little girl in my own home, and then you pull a stunt like this ? I got news for you. You walk out of that show, you're walking out of this marriage. And our relationship. You are two peas in one fucked-up pod. Yeah. - Yep ! - Get the hell out of our lives. Jerry don't want you on his show anyway. He don't want no fucked-up redneck inbreds. I'd kick you out myself if it wouldn't mess up my pedicure. I ain't doin' it. You're not ? Hell no. I ain't gonna make an ass out of myself on TV. No way. I'm going to the airport, changing my ticket. You coming ? - Come here, Willie. - Angel, I-- - Get your ass over here now. - Don't you say nothin' to Willie. He's a man of his word. Ain't that right ? He ain't a pecker like you, and back out at the last minute. You comin' or not ? You don't want to do something so hurtful. Do you ? After all I've done for you ? No, ma'am. You better go alone. You sure ? Yes, he's sure ! Get the hell out of our faces ! Good luck, on the show and the marriage. You poor motherfucker. [ Door Slams Shut ] [ Mel ] Got your six-shooter ?

All right. Have a good show, Jerry. Okay. It's like we're movie stars, isn't it, Angel baby ? Wait a minute ! I can't believe we're here. Y'all didn't say nothin' to Starletta, did you ? You hear something ? Sounds like a scraggly-assed junkyard hound dog to me. You want to sit here ? Where we gonna sit ? Wow. So, Connie, what did it feel like when you found out... your little girl here was having a sexual relationship with your husband ? It was the worst day of my life. Good. And, Angel, you must've been real pissed when you found out your mom... was having a sexual relationship with your fiance, right ? I didn't give a shit really. I mean-- It's-- I was really pissed. Okay. Willie, I'll bet you were hurt and angry... when you found out your fiancee was sleeping with her stepfather. Am I right ? [ Groans ] Willie ? [ Willie Vomiting ] Lord. [ Chanting ] Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! [ Chanting Continues ] [ Chanting Continues ] Places, everyone. Break a leg, baby. That's what they say, isn't it ? Mm-hmm. - I'm telling 'em everything. - No, you are not. I am. I am. We need everyone in places. Okay. Okay, everybody, set. Let's get ready to go. Okay, baby ? What did he say to upset you so much ? [ Audience Chanting, Cheering ] Five. Four. [ Cheering ] Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks very much. I'd like to welcome everybody. Thank you. You're very nice. Welcome. We've got a great show today. It is... "I Slept with My Stepdaddy." Oooh. And Mom's pretty ticked. We've got a great show. Let's get right to it ! [ Cheering ] [ Angel On TV ] First it was no big deal. Just blow jobs when my mom would be out playing bingo. After a while, we fell in love. You did what with my husband ? In my own home ? That's "a" ass kicking. You know what I'm saying ? Let me see if I got this right. Angel is your fiancee. And when Connie found out that her daughter... was having a relationship with her husband, she began to have a sexual relationship with you ? - To teach her a lesson. - Right. [ Jerry ] So you willingly... had sex with your fiancee's mother, and that doesn't bother you ? Why not ? I'm sure as shit not having sex with my fiancee. Look at her ass. I know she ain't. She ain't no-- I know you ain't lookin' that hard. She ain't no vir-- - Me and Angel have never had sex. - Willie ! - Never ? - Never. She wants to marry me because she's pregnant with her stepdaddy's baby. [ Audience Groaning ] She's afraid everyone's gonna find out about it. Since I got a good job at Wal-Mart in Lakeland, she thinks we can raise a baby, and everyone will think it's ours. Motherfucker ! Shit ! You're pregnant with Rusty's baby ? Don't be looking at me like that. You're the one that stole my diaphragm. [ Angel ] It's true, Jerry. When my mother started having an affair with my fiance, she borrowed my clothes and my diaphragm. That's sick. White people are nasty. No. Sick is coming to your show in L.A., and to catch her having sex with him. [ Audience Groaning ] Wait. Hold up. Did you see the two of them having sex ? No, wait. Hey, hey, hey. [ Audience Cheering ] Let go of me ! Come on. You can't-- Calm down. You stinkin' dog. You ain't never gettin' no more of this ! You need to quit. Wookie-looking little motherfucker. Please, everybody. Don't talk that shit. What shit ? We ain't talkin' shit. Don't call at my house. I'm tired of denying you. You stinkin' dog ! You stick it anywhere, don't you ? Calm down. You can't be attacking our guest. You know better than that. Particularly a pregnant one. Everybody calm down. You okay ? All right, go ahead. Don't look at me. Mama-- I said, don't look at me ! Jerry, give me that microphone. Me and Vonda saw Demond last night with her ! Yeah, it was her ! You had sex with Demond last night ? Of course not, baby. She's lyin', 'cause me and Leshawnette saw them kissing at 3:00 in the mornin'. Y'all sure ? Hold my shit. Yeah ! Child molester ! What's up with you ? Old as you are, acting like a broke-ass Tammy Bakker. Broke Wal-Mart Bitch ! I can't believe you fucked him. You knew I liked him, and went after him anyway. You are always going after my boyfriends. You told your mom you liked him when you're engaged to me ? - Shut up ! - [ Starletta ] You bitch ! [ Audience Chanting ] Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! Freaks. Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! What ? That's bullshit. That ain't no bullshit. You know what the bullshit is ? Is your ass talking about you was at Bible class. What the hell was you thinkin' ? You wanted a double scoop of skank ? Was that it ? I hope you wore six condoms. Better yet, did you wear a body condom ? You wear a condom on your tongue ? Huh ? You ain't gotta worry about touching me. - Fuck you ! - Don't you touch my man ! Don't you touch my man ! Get your hands off my man ! [ Audience Chanting ] Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! Let me go. Fuck you ! [ Chanting Continues ] [ Angel ] Get the fuck off of me ! You started it. He didn't start nothin' ! There you go, taking my fiance's side. Why don't you fuck him here ? Bitch ! You're never comin' back home. Fuck you. This is my baby. I'll take my baby and go somewhere else. You are not my daughter. I'll take your damn husband, bitch. [ Angel ] Fuck you. [ Connie ] You piece of white fuckin' trash. I'll be back with a personal observation after this word. Crazy bitches. [ Angel ] Well, you did it, got me on TV. Hope you're fuckin' happy. [ Natalie ] Let me get you a glass of water. Thanks. [ Connie ] I want to say something. And saying something like this doesn't come easy to me, so I'm just gonna say it up front. All right ? Okay. I had no business getting pregnant at 15. But it happened, and I dealt with it. I never regretted it for a minute, not even a second. You know that, Angel baby. I know it. It's just that... a parent ought to have a world view, a belief, a structure-- I don't know what the word is. Just something to pass on down to her kid. I didn't have none of that to pass on down to you. All I'm trying to say... is that a parent wants to get better for a little girl. Sometimes that just ain't too easy. I done some things I don't understand. I don't think anybody'd understand it. Sometimes I lay at night in bed and I'm thinkin', "Some of the things you done to Angel ain't right." And you know it ! I don't know why I did some of the things I done, but I am sorry. Very truly deeply from the bottom of my heart sorry. I mean it. I know it. I promise I'm going to do better. I ain't gonna be crazy like I've been. Those days are over for me. I'm sick of it. I'm gonna be better. You'll see. I believe you. Okay, I got you some water. Can me and my daughter have a moment alone ? Just be a minute. [ Door Closes ] What you gonna do ? I don't know. Have it ? I don't know. Fact that it's Rusty's... don't make it any easier. I know it. Not that I'm passing judgment, 'cause I'm in no position to pass judgment. Why don't we think on it a little bit ? Decide what's best. We don't have a whole lot of time. Yeah, I know it. But... it'll come to us. You'll see. I feel better. All things considered, Mama, I think you done a real good job raising me. Thank you, sweetheart. I tried the best I could. Let's get the guests in their seats, calm the audience down. [ Director ] Get ready for Jerry. You know, it's hard to know what to do when you're angry. You saw today people who had difficulty expressing that anger. What we saw was a pitiful bunch of sinners ! All of you are the scum of the earth ! The worst America has to offer. You're gonna go straight to hell. - You're pathetic, miserable excuses for the human species. - Have a seat. That's enough. I'm not even sure you're a part of the human species. You're no better than a pack of wild animals. Hell no ! Hey, just sit down. You should be ashamed. These people don't belong on TV. You keep ragging on these people. Let me tell you something. The rich and famous go on television every single day. They reveal intimate, lurid details of their private lives. They tell us who they sleep with, what drugs they're on. And we can't get enough of it ! We just love that stuff ! Now, these people come on. They're not rich. They're not powerful. They're not famous. They're talking about the exact same issues. They don't speak the King's English. They don't belong to your fine, fancy neighborhoods and country clubs. - But you know what ? - Tell him, Jerry. They hurt just as much. And what are they now, the scum of the earth... because they don't have your money, your power and your elitism ? How dare they go on television ! I got a program note for you, buddy. This is a slice of American life. And if you don't like it, bite something else. [ Audience Cheering ] Jerry ! Jerry ! - Whoo ! - Jerry ! Jerry ! [ Audience Cheering, Chanting ] Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! You're so lucky. Yo, word is bond, kid. Little ladies, the show's not until tomorrow, so take tonight to think about it. No. We done made up our minds. We ain't doin' the show. Hello. Why not ? 'Cause... they ain't no traitors. Y'all my girls. Girl, look at you ! Oh, man ! You give her a hug, you ain't-- I'm serious. I love my girls. What about Demond ? Fuck Demond, girl. It's about us. Fuck him. [ Vonda ] We going out tonight ? Yeah ! [ All Chattering ] Let's say good-bye to Jerry. You think ? Oh, yeah. Come on, let's go. [ Mel ] You've always been a populist, Jerry. Some things don't change. Remember when my mom and dad came to visit us when we first started doing the show ? Yep. They were very proud of you. [ Jerry ] Why not ? I had already been a mayor, was a news anchor. I was going to be the next Walter Cronkite. My name means something a lot different now than it did back then. [ Natalie ] Ah, Jer, you always land on your feet. He's in there. All of a sudden I'm nervous. You're going in there. I'm not doing it. You said you were. I know, I know. I'll do it. Jerry, I'm sorry to interrupt. My daughter and me were wonderin' if you'd pose in a picture with us ? Ah... sure. Oh, thanks ! We'll only be a minute. We did bring the camera from the hotel, didn't we ? I think so. What bag did you put it in ? I thought in this one. It's not in mine. Oh, here it is. - Why don't I take it ? - Oh, thank you, sugar. All you have to do is press that button. You don't got to focus it or none of that. All right. Why don't you guys get together ? Okay, we'll stand here. [ Mel ] Say "Velveeta." One, two, three. I think I might've blinked. Could you take another one ? Sure. [ Mel ] Cheesecake. Great. - There you go. - Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sure, absolutely. [ Mel ] Bye, ladies. Have a good trip back. Oy vay, huh ? What a business. Have a nice day. All right. You're still bein' a dog ! Wait, you can take his off. Ain't you the lonely one ? [ Laughs ] Come on, the coast is clear. We've got time for one drink. Look ! [ Jerry On TV ] Let me see if I have this right. You say that you have sex with men while you're dressed like a woman. These guys have no idea that you're really a man ? [ Woman In Audience ] No way ! I don't mean any disrespect, but I find it hard to believe... that somebody could be having sex with you and not realize you're really a guy. I had sex with one of your staff members. Why don't you ask him ? Oh, my God ! Staff member ? [ Charlie ] Yeah, Troy Davenport. I knew it ! I called it, didn't I, Mama ? He's gay. [ Connie ] You did. He met me as Claire, and we had sex. He's a member of our staff. Let's bring him out. Troy ! Come on, buddy. They need you in there. Give me a break. [ Audience Applauding ] [ Both Squealing ] Troy, is that true ? [ Laughing ] Oh, my God ! E.R., my ass ! [ Both Laughing ] [ Chanting ] Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry ! Oh, my God. Till next time, take care of yourself... and each other. You too, Jerry. Isn't he a sweet man ? Just as sweet as can be. And good looking too. Yes, he is. Can we have two Jack Daniel's on the rocks, please ? Maybe I shouldn't drink now that I'm pregnant. Hell, I drank when I was pregnant with you. You turned out all right. I've been thinkin'. I don't think you should marry Willie. You and the baby should stay with me. I was thinkin' the same thing. The baby belongs with its mama and its grandma. Oh, Lord. I'm gonna be a grandma. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Hmm ? We better get going. It's getting close. You know what ? What ? This is the first family vacation we ever had. We never got to do that. All and all, I think we done pretty good. I agree. All right. Well, let's go, Angel baby. We got a plane to catch. [ Angel ] I can't believe how small that studio was. It looks so much bigger on TV. Willie, let's go ! You got all that ? There's one on the side of the couch. I'm ready to go home. How about you ? You bet. Them burgers from that little Clown Burger place ! They were very good. Excellent. ♪ Oh, yeah Cool ♪ Lord have mercy. [ Angel ] Jesus Christ has come to the trailer park. He's got really big feet. Hey, y'all my neighbors ? Why, yes. Hi. My name's Angel. I'm Connie. Hi, Connie. How are you ? Very good. I just moved in a minute ago. Rented number two. Did you really ? We just came back from a trip ourselves. We were renting number three. So we are neighbors ! We certainly are. You want to help us with the bags ? I'd love to. Aren't you sweet ?
