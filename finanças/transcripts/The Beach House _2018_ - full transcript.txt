♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Good morning. Good morning. Hi sweetie. ♪ ♪ Good morning! ♪ ♪ [voicemail]: You have two unheard messages. First message. Cara, I just heard... you got fired? Are you kidding me? Look, I know you're on your way back home for a visit... Hi Cara, hi it's Richard. Look, I really wanted to tell you in person but I-I don't want you to hear it from someone else. They gave me your accounts and they're... What? They're moving me upstairs. Perfect. [cars honking] [phone ringing] [cars honking] Sorry. Caretta. Hi, mama. I can't believe it. What a wonderful surprise. Sorry, I would have called, I just... Oh, well, whatever brought you I couldn't be happier. Oh... is everything alright? Of course. How long have you been asking me to visit? Forever. And you're always too busy. Oh, baby. I have missed you. Come on in the house. You hungry? Yeah. Kick those shoes off. Go barefoot. No. You know, when you were little I couldn't keep shoes on you. Mama, this house looks a little run down. Well, we're just one big shabby chic around here and I'm including myself. Can't stop the ruins of Rome. That's what I tell myself. [laughs] What does that even mean? You get old. Mama, you're not old. Well, thank you, baby. Oh. You haven't changed a thing. Well, it's perfect just the way it is. Why would I? Yeah. Oh. Boy, we had some good times here, didn't we? You and your brother just running around like wild things. How long can you stay? I don't know, a week? A week? Well, that's no time at all. They must be just working you to death up there in Chicago. Let's not waste a minute. We'll walk on the beach. The turtles are layin'. Mama, the turtles... I think I'm gonna go check out the marina. You still like shrimp? Of course I do. I'm still me, aren't I? I guess so, yeah. Would ya look at her. I know, right. Can I help you? Yeah, uh, two pounds of shrimp, please. Two pounds of shrimp. You got it. First time on the island? Uh, no. Uh, I've been coming here since I was a baby. Really? Yeah. I wouldn't have guessed. 'Cause of these? [laughs] Exactly. Yeah. I'd go with the brown ones. It matches your eyes. [small chuckle] They are still brown, right? Brett. Didn't see you there. Uh, yes you did. I'll take the brown and the red. It matches the stain on his t-shirt. Barbecue sauce. Still putting that on everything? Yeah. Including my shirt, apparently. Hmm. Oh, Caretta. Uh, yeah. People don't call me that anymore. That's too bad. How long has it been, five years? Three, actually. Three. Mmmhmm. Your heels weren't as high. Yeah, and you had a fiancé. Right. Yeah, it didn't work out. No? She didn't like barbecue sauce on everything? [laughs] Yeah, pretty much. You know, I gotta tell ya, I'm really glad to see you. Really? Yeah, your mom's been worried sick about you. Oh. Wait, why is she worried about me? She doesn't like you being alone. Oh. Well, I am not alone, so... She says you're having trouble finding a... a nice guy. [chuckles] You having fun embarrassing me? Kinda. Well, I should go. Wouldn't want my mom to worry. Oh, there we go! Those were very expensive! Most useless things are! I'll see you around, Caretta! If you're lucky! [laughs] Lovie! Did you hear? Hear what? Two new nests, right back there. Two, why didn't you tell me? Well, I just did. I thought you were coming out earlier. I had a surprise. Cara came to see me. Lovie. Oh, that's wonderful. How is she? The same. Maybe more so. Well, I'm sure the advertising world is stressful. She's a real go-getter, that girl. She always has been. Where is she? In town. Anything to avoid my turtles. [laughs] Well, this might come as a shock but not everyone in the universe wants to spend their day staking turtle's nests. Well, I don't know why not. Especially my own daughter. That apple rolled far from this tree. The nest is right over here. Look at that. Yes, it's beautiful. Isn't that wonderful? Can you believe it? It's huge. Ok, here we go. Now, where did you put those eggs? Be careful. Ok, it's not there. Try the centre. Okay. Oh. Yes! Oh, that's fabulous. I just love it. [blender sounds] Hi. Hi. Oh, you're Caretta. Sorry, I recognized you from your photos. Just making Mama Lovie her green smoothie. Mama Lovie? Uh, yeah... just a silly little thing. I call her Mama Lovie and she calls me Mama Toy. 'Cause I'm expecting. I see that. Do you mind taking this to her for me? I'm just gonna head off to my room. It was nice meeting you. Your room? What room? Uh, Palmer's room. Palmer's room. Yeah. Toy's only 20 years old. Alone and pregnant. She's like a companion. She helps me out and I help her out. So you asked her to move in with you? Why not? No one else is using those rooms. Besides, she has no family. What about the baby's father? A bolter. Gone like the wind. Flo heard about her situation and thought I could use some help. She's a sweet girl. I didn't know you like green juices. No. I don't. But Toy thinks they're good for me and I don't want to hurt her feelings. [phone rings] Oh honey, can you go get that, please? Yeah. Hello? Cara? Palmer. You sound just like a Yankee. And your accent gets thicker by the year. Oh, you know nothing ever changes down here. Not the weather, not the accents. How long are you in town for? I was gonna stay a week but I don't know if I'll last that long. Advertising world can't live without you, huh? Something like that. How's the family? How about you come see them for yourself? You and mom come out to Charleston for the weekend. Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna make it. I ain't takin' no for an answer You haven't been up to the house since daddy's funeral. Look, I'll make you some frogmore stew. [laughs] You remembered. Daddy! Oh, little lady. How am I supposed to forget my sister's favourite meal? Can you help me with these golf clubs, buddy? Yes. Is mama home? Hey honey, I'm home. I don't think she likes me. She's just been away too long, that's all. She'll come around. I do get the sense that something else is bothering her. She was never the type of daughter to confide in her mother. You think this is why she came to visit? She doesn't know anything about it and we're gonna keep it that way, right? Don't you worry. Everything's gonna be ok. I'm so excited about the frogmore stew. That is a lovely idea. And I haven't been to the house in ages. You say that like it's an expedition. It's less than an hour away. And it's your house. Well, it's really Palmer's now. And besides, why leave paradise? Looks like paradise could use a little fixing up. And the pergola looks like it could come down any minute. We're fine. And besides, Palmer's got me on a strict budget. Palmer has you on a budget? I have an idea. Why don't we make a casserole together and we can take it over to Palmer's Saturday night? Are you sure? But that's a family thing. Well, you're family too, baby. I'd love to. Thank you. Evening, Caretta. Hi Brett. You brought flowers. Yes I did. That's very nice. I try. Thank you. You saved me a trip to the nursery. I was going right by there. Now, let's have a look at that leaky sink. And you're staying for dinner. If you insist. I hope you brought your appetite. Oh yeah. How did you like what Brett's done with the marina, sweetie? It's lovely, mama. Yeah, it has changed a lot since you two were dating. Oh, Brett and Cara made the cutest couple. It was one summer, mom. Ta-da-da-da-da... Actually, I think it was about a year and a half. If we're counting that summer you went to Chicago. We're not. Riding on the boat ride? You stranded us on purpose. We ran out of gas. Did we? Who can remember these things? I... maybe I had a spare tank of gas somewhere. [laughs] Uh-huh. Oh, there is nothing like first love. I will never understand why you two broke up. Me either. His life is here and mine's not. Plus, she was a little snooty. I wasn't snooty. Was I snooty? No. [laughs] Ok, maybe a little. To Cara and Brett. And the turtles. How about just to the turtles? To the turtles. To the turtles. Well, if y'all will excuse me, I'm gonna head on up to bed. Me too. What? 'Night, Lovie. Thanks for dinner. Good night. Have fun. Do you believe this? What? They're trying to set us up. Hey, don't look at me. I just came to fix the sink. The sink that wasn't broken. [laughs] So uh... I saw one of your ad campaigns. You did? Mmmhmm. Cheese-less mac and cheese. Yeah, Lovie, she-she cut it out of a magazine, distributed it all over the island. Oh no. Oh yes. And I gotta tell you the truth. I bought a box. What'd you think? It needed cheese. Yeah. [laughs] I'm sorry. I'll reimburse you. Ah, well then you're gonna have to reimburse me for that better butter spray stuff, too, God it was awful. Oh God, now I'm really embarrassed. [laughs] Don't be. Look at you. You moved away and achieved your dreams. How many people can say that? A lot of people. Only one I know. She's sitting right there. It's really sweet the way you look after Lovie. She does her share of looking after me, too. I doubt you need much looking after. Every now and then we all do, right? Do you remember when we said the only thing we wanted was to be happy? I'm pretty sure I'm the one that said that, yeah. Oh. What did I say? You wanted more. I said that? Yeah. You have a good memory. Unfortunately for both of us that's true. [laughs] Well, goodnight, Caretta. Uh, you know, I was thinkin'... maybe we finish that boat ride while you're around. I don't know. I got a bigger tank of gas. Ooh, and a new boat. It's just that I'm not here for very long, so... Did you just see me get down on one knee and propose? No. It's just a spin up the waterway. Come on. It's just that I don't wanna waste your time with me leaving and everything. Uh-huh. Well, what was I thinking? Have a wonderful night, Caretta. You ok? You alright? Yeah, I'm ok. Just got a little dizzy, that's all. Oh, hello. Mama, you ok? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You would think that I would know to eat breakfast before I go check on my loggerheads. We have a new nest. Do you wanna come see the nest? I would love to but I was gonna do a little shopping in town if that's ok? Of course, baby. You don't need my permission. Just be sure you're back in time to get to Charleston for dinner. Ok. Oh, oh, oh, and um... you might wanna change that dress. You don't wanna get it wet in case you're on a boat or something. I'm not getting on a boat. [laughs] Uh-huh. [clears throat] Hi. Would you like to rent a boat today, ma'am? This place is more fancy than I remember. Yeah, yeah, you gotta keep up appearances for the boat people. Especially the ones from Chicago. They're persnickety. Persnickety? Uh-huh. Who says persnickety? I saw it in this morning's crossword. It means picky. I know what it means. Here. Oh, you didn't have to do this. I put in extra barbecue sauce. Uh-huh. I see you kept your dad's boathouse. Sentimental value. I thought maybe, you know, I don't know, for old time's sake, maybe if you wanted to go out on the water or something... Are you asking me out? No. No, it's just out on the water. It's not out. Out is out. It's not... Brett? Yeah? Hey. Uh, we're from the Coastal Commission. Terry said you could help us with the dolphin research? Right, no, yeah, he called. Uh, let me help you aboard. Come on. You a dolphin expert now? Jack of all trades. Come on, Cara. There's plenty of room. No. That's ok. Join us. Another time. I'm gonna hold you to that. Ok. Boat ride over already? Brett was busy. Mama, what are all these photos? Oh, it's a project I'm finally getting around to. Hmm. Look at my Lady Bank roses. They're so beautiful. The fragrance. You could smell it all the way down to the beach. Mmm. Who's this? Oh, that's Russell. Russell? Russell Bennet. He owned some property on the beach. Mmm. You're blushing. I am not. You are. He's the one that taught me about the turtles, that's all. Oh, that's all? It was a lifetime ago. Before I met your father. Well, we better get dressed for dinner. There might be traffic. Ok. Where did I put my pearls? Pearls? Mama, we're just going to Palmer's. I know, but every time I go in town some proper southern lady takes over. Nothing fits. Oh honey, you look so pretty. Not for your son's house. Oh, for heaven sakes. I'll tell you what. Put this on. Now there you go. Let's see. Oh yes. You look so nice. Why don't you just keep it? Thank you, that's so sweet. So Palmer's fish AND the boat keys ended up in the water. [laughing] You talk funny. I do? That's 'cause she sounds like a Yankee now. What's a Yankee? I'll tell you what a Yankee is. A Yankee is someone that leaves their family without even a backwards glance. He lost at golf today which always makes him cranky. I'm not cranky. Welcome home, favourite sister. She's your only sister. Careful with that drink. Might put the southern back in you, Caretta. How come you call her Caretta? That's her name, sweetheart. It was. I like it. Me too. Caretta is the scientific name for the loggerheads. The world's largest hardshell turtle. Your grandmother thinks I have a hard shell. I named you after something I love. It's a good thing she didn't name me "shrimp". [laughing] To our family. All back together again. Cheers. Cheers. Toy, honey, let's go into the kitchen and help Julia with dinner. She is one of Charleston's finest cooks. I don't recall her being that motherly to us. You know mama. Always a sucker for the lost cause. Just like she is for her turtles. Why don't you come on in? I'll show you what Julia's done with the place. There he is. Still staring down at us. Can you believe he's been gone three years now? Everything's so different. Yeah. What'd mama think? Mama? Yeah. I'd think she'd wanna start dismantling the house and sell it now that he's gone. Did she say something to you? Or are you speculating? You gonna come eat, you two? Yes, dear. After you. Just like his daddy, right honey. What about that time you flipped that golf cart? Oh God. You remember that? [laughing] I've never seen daddy so worried and mad at the same time. [laughter] Man. Well, Julia darling, this has just been lovely. But we better be getting on the road. Oh, no. The night's still young, mama. Oh, Palmer, it's a long drive. I don't ever get to see you. Just stay a little bit longer. Palmer, it's a long drive. Stay a little bit longer. I'm tired- I don't get to see you- Palmer, stop! Well, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna go rest up on the couch a little bit. Ok sweetheart. That's ok? Yes, baby. Look, I was thinking about what you said earlier. About the house and um... mama, I think you should come stay here with Julie and I. What? Yeah. Why? Because I miss you. Do I need another reason? Besides, that old beach house? A little wind could blow that place down. Primrose Cottage has survived a number of hurricanes. I am fine right where I am. Yeah, mama, I just don't like you out there all by yourself. I'm not by myself. Toy is with me. Well, that's something else we need to talk about. She is a sweet girl. I'm sure she is, but best be counting the silver. Palmer! What? What? That's what daddy would always say. Trouble is, Palmer, all of mama's silver is here with you. Along with the rest of the house. You don't have a horse in this race. You left us a long time ago. Besides, I haven't taken anything from anyone. I'm simply managing mama's affairs. You know she doesn't have a mind for numbers. When did you become just like daddy? Mama, tell him you're perfectly capable of handling your own affairs. He's right, I-I'm not particularly good at those sort of things. You see? And that's that. Sweetheart, will you please cut me another slice of cake? I think we've all had enough sugar- I asked for another slice of cake. Will you please cut it for me? I didn't realize anyone was up. Sorry, I couldn't sleep. I'll get out of your way. Hang on, Toy. I'm sorry about Palmer, I don't know much you heard. I didn't belong there, anyway. Don't say that. He had no right to talk like that. It's fine. It's not fine. And I haven't been that nice, either. It's... Maybe I can make it up to you? I could take you to lunch before I leave today? Before you leave? I... I thought you were staying a week? Yeah, um... I- I gotta get back. Cara, honey. Why are you leaving? Is this about last night? Mama, I just don't fit in here. I never did. Oh honey, that's not true. Please don't mind Palmer. He means well underneath. He's a good boy. Go ahead and defend him. Just like you defended daddy. You know I don't like confrontation. Why? Because it's not ladylike? We're supposed to just smile and needlepoint our lives away and everything will magically be alright? Honey, now you're just being dramatic. No, I'm not. I grew up watching the way daddy treated you. The perfect docile wife that made daddy look good at the country club. Don't you ever wonder why I ran away when I was younger? I know you had to get away from your father, you two were like fire and gasoline. No. Not because of him. Because of you. You couldn't stand up to him, not once. And now you can't stand up to Palmer. Cara. I'm not like you, mom. I'll never be. [knocking] Mama. I'm sorry. I know. I didn't mean those things I said. You're right. I've made a million mistakes. We all have. I didn't come here to fight. I know, sweetheart. Mama, what are all those pills for? Oh, um... just this and that. Nothing. I'm um... vitamins. I've never known you to take anything resembling a vitamin. Well, you haven't been around that much. Oh, Toy's on a health regimen and I thought why not? I'm glad you're not here alone. Oh, baby. I could never be alone here. There are way too many memories. Cara, I um... I'm sure you've got a lot of work piling up in Chicago but... could you stay a little longer? You just got here. Ok. Ok. Mmmhmm. Just like that. No argument. Nope. [laughing] [knocking] Lovie, are you ready to go? Oh, I'm gonna take Toy on her appointment. Mama, I can take her. No baby, you stay here and let Brett in. Brett? He's coming over to fix the sink. He just fixed it two days ago. Oh, it broke again. Mama, are you breaking things just so he'll come by? Now would I do that? Yes, you would. Sink's fine. Of course it is. I'm sorry. That's ok. Guess what? Turns out I have the afternoon off. Oh, that's ok. What're you talking about? Come on, we wouldn't wanna let Lovie down. We wouldn't want to disappoint her. She put so much work into this. I've disappointed her plenty. Nah. It's all she talks about, how proud of you she is. Come on. You owe me a boat ride. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ It's been forever since I've done this. Pretty sure you've got a big-sized lake up there. Yeah. Yeah, I can see it from my 30th storey window. Sounds tall. Yeah. It is. Especially when the elevators break. There's something to be said about a ground floor, huh? Yeah. You're so lucky you get to do what you love every day. Don't you? Well, I've spent every waking moment for the last five years in an office. That's a lot of moments. It's very competitive. I got fired a couple of days ago. You're the first person I've told. I'm sorry. It's ok. I do feel a little blindsided though. Yeah. Richard, my co-worker - he was a little more than my co-worker - he's the one who threw me under the bus. Right there. Alright. There we go. Welcome home. I wish I had different news. I do think you should continue the treatment. Will it cure me? Well, as I said, there is no cure. And the tumour can't be operated on, but radiation will give us more time- Tell me, Dr. Pittman, if you had one summer left would you spend it getting radiation? You know, summer has always been my favourite season. One more is good enough for me. Please, mama Lovin, please just listen to what the doctor says. Oh, Toy, honey, come on now, don't you go getting upset. Your baby can feel your sadness. And we don't have time for one single sad minute. No. You know what? I would really like a milkshake. And a real one. Not one of those green ones. Come on, let's go. Thank you, Dr. Pittman. [seagulls squawking] You have to tell Cara. She is just so tightly wound. And I don't want her telling me what to do. But she's family. Have you told your family about your baby yet? That's different. The only reason they'd care is to remind themselves of why they don't want me around. If you don't tell her and she leaves she might not ever see you again. [sighs] I know, sweetheart. You're right. It almost feels like I never left. Almost. Didn't I just see you wearing high heels at the marina? [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, I guess you did. Sure. You're never gonna let me live that down, are you? Nope. [laughs] Fair enough. You know, I almost left a few years back. Really? Mmmhmm. I had it all planned out. After dad retired I fixed the place up. Put the whole business up for sale. I got some good offers, too. I bet you did. I just couldn't do it. It kind of turns out I love this place. It's me, I guess. It is you. It was you once, too. No. I mean, I guess, but summer's not real life. Is it? I don't know, I'm not sure I'd say that. Declaration of Independence came about in summer. Ok. The moon landing. Mmmhmm. Most importantly Babe Ruth's 500. Home run. Wow, you're just a wealth of information, aren't you? Yeah, I read a lot. Yeah, but comic books don't count. [seagulls squawking] I didn't catch your name. Russell. Bennett. Russell Bennett. I was just about to go look for some new nests, if you'd like to come with me? I'll teach you everything I know. Earth to mama. Where were you just then? Oh, just thinking about how much I love this place. Mmm. It is really beautiful. Did you have a good time with Brett? I did. You were gone a long time. Were we? Mama, is that Palmer? What is he doing here? And wearing his street shoes in the sand. Oh, I swear that boy didn't get a single one of my genes. Nope. These two parcels here, they were deeded to the Coastal Conservatory, but this one right here in the middle. I can't find a transfer of title. At one point they were all owned by the same person. Have you ever heard of someone by the name of Russell Bennett? Yes. A long time ago. I figured you would. He was some kind of marine biologist. Turtles were his thing. Why don't we go in the house and have some tea and talk about something more civilized than real estate? Mama, that's some view you've got. It's the same view she's always had. That spot that you saw me out on the beach. I wanna buy that. What? Do you know how much that property is worth? Flanked by protected beach? There isn't any more land to develop up and down the coast. If I could just find out who owns it. You sound just like your father. Always looking for more. Why can't you be satisfied with what you've got? Actually, mama, I could use the money. I mean, with the kids and everything... She gave you the house in Charleston. There's no mortgage on it. There is now. You borrowed against her house? Mama, did you agree to that? I don't understand, Palmer. That's exactly it, mama. You don't need to understand. I have all your finances under control. But you said that you don't have money. How are you gonna buy the house if you- We're gonna sell this old place. As soon as I find that chain of title I'm gonna buy that title, we're gonna put up some condos- we're gonna make a fortune. Palmer, she loves this house. Look, this doesn't concern you. You walked out on us years ago. Well, I'm here now. Yeah? And how long before you run back to Chicago for another 15 years, sis? Another day or two? Long enough to speak up for my mother. I can speak for myself. My parents left me this house, and your father resented it the whole time we were married because it was mine. And it's the only thing that was. When I couldn't take it anymore, the country club or the cocktail parties for his business partners, this is where I would come. It is the only place I have ever felt like myself. It is my home. And nobody's selling it. So, Brett Beauchamps, huh? [laughs] What'd you tell her, mama? Nothing. Flo knows everything about everyone on the island. Honey, I am faster than the internet. Now, where were we? Brett. There's nothing to tell, Flo. That blush does not say nothing. It's not blush, it's... it's a sunburn. [whistling] And there he is now, right on time. Good morning. Flowers. Lovie will be so happy. They're beautiful. Actually, they're for you. And a card. That's very sweet. Awe. That's so sweet. Uh, do you wanna get outta here? Yes. Ooh, summer love. I don't know if she believes in that concept anymore. Who doesn't believe in love? I wasn't the best role model. Oh, you did your best. You're gonna have to tell her before she leaves. I know. My humble abode. Go on. Yep, come a long way since that apartment above the bait shop. Plus, it doesn't smell like bait. [laughs] No, it doesn't. Come on. My mom had one of those. She gave it to me. Did she? Mmmhmm. Nah, she's been a good friend to me. You know, after the last hurricane I thought I was gonna go out of business. I probably would have, too, if it wasn't for her talking me up to everyone on the island. Not to mention she stopped me from making a really big mistake. Oh yeah? Go on. She sat me down, made me a nice dinner, and she told me on not so uncertain terms that my fiancé was completely wrong for me. You broke up because of my mother? She was right. I'm sorry. I like to say I was blindsided but actually I was relieved. I'm sure you would have figured it out without Lovie. She did teach me one thing, though. What's that? You gotta wait for the right one. Huh. Isn't it all you boatmen who say there's plenty of fish in the sea? Not me. Mmm-mmm. Huh. Really? Mmm-mmm. 'Cause I'm pretty sure that was on your website. You looked up my website. I mean, I might have for, like, professional reasons. Of course, of course. I didn't assume anything else. But... but what did you think? Professionally, of course. Professionally speaking, I think that you could probably use a... I don't know, a catch phrase. A catch phrase. Mmmhmm. Like what? Like something... memorable. My... my smile isn't enough? [laughs] No, sadly, I don't think so. Ouch. I think something like um... "good things come to those who bait". [laughs] I like that. Thank you. It's on the house. You can have that. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Good grip. There you go. Take down and roll. Take it down and roll. Ok, ok, I can do it. Maybe we could talk about us, hmm? Look, I'm sure I could fall for you all over again with that annoying southern charm and those big blue eyes. Keep going. No, I like where this is going. Keep going. Mmmhmm. I just think we'll end up where we did before. So... You might be right. Maybe this is who we are supposed to be. Two people who run into each other every few years. Take a magical boat ride. You dropped your towel. I know. I'll get it. But we'll never know if you keep running away. I'm not running away. Your life is here and mine's not. Mmmhmm. All I'm sayin' is maybe you're just afraid to feel something. Because if you do you might have to stick around. You were named after the turtles. I know they migrate, too, but they always come home. This isn't my home. It's just a place I spent a few summers. Sorry. It's ok. Have a safe trip back, alright? Can we talk? Tell Lovie I'll be back to fix the shutters after you leave. [laughs] Oh my! Oh! Cara? Cara?! Oh, Cara, honey? Get out of the shower, get dressed quick. What? I have something to show you. Right now? Yes, Cara, honey! Come on, right now! Oh, mom. You brought me out here to see a turtle? I thought something happened. Something did, honey. Come look. Oh, you won't believe how rare it is to see a mama Loggerhead. Honey, come sit. She's diggin' her nest. I saw her come up right out of the ocean. In all my years I've only seen it a couple of times. Oh, look. She's starting to lay. Mama, is she... crying? The scientists have an explanation for it but I think she's cryin'. After she lays her eggs she'll make her way back to the ocean and swim away. She won't be able to protect them. She won't know if any of them made it. And there's so many predators, and the worst are humans. I had no idea. That's why we're all so nuts. Yeah. Us crazy turtle people. [laughs] We're all she's got in her corner. I am so lucky I got to see you grow into a wonderful, strong woman. Mama, I'll come visit. [sighs] A lot. I promise. What? I have been trying to think of a easy way to tell you this and there just isn't one. What? I have cancer. What? It's terminal. No, mom. I can get you the best doctors in Chicago. We can fight this. You're not gonna die. I know, Cara. I've tried all that. Honey, I've done all the work, I know, I... Mama. All I want is for you to stay a little longer. That's all I want. Mama. My baby. I don't understand why she's not willing to fight this. Well, the doctor said um... it'll just slow down what's already gonna happen. Believe me, I tried. She wants this last summer the way she wants it. Last summer? Well, the doctor said that's how long she has left. I don't know what we're gonna do without her. Thank you for being here with her. Well, you're here now. We both are. Oh dear. You two look like someone's dying around here. Come on, now. We're gonna have none of that. We're gonna make this the best summer yet. It already is, honey. I just picked the first bunch of limes from my tree. Woo-hoo! Lovie pretends they're for limeade but she really likes them for her evening margaritas. [laughing] Well, guess who I just ran into down at the boat dock? Oooh, I bet I can guess. He doesn't seem as happy as he was a few days ago. We kinda decided to end things. End things? But you just started. It's just easier this way, mama. Well, who said that love was easy? I don't know. It's not love. Well, then what is it? I don't know. Maybe it's something like your hatchlings, some make it to the water, some don't. Well, they try like the dickens to get there. Oh, honey. I just want you to be able to give your heart to someone without being afraid to have it broken. That's not what I'm afraid of. I get it. You don't wanna end up like me. And I don't blame you. Your father and I were not a match made in heaven. But I do know what true love is. [crash] [yelp] I'm sorry, mama Lovie. Oh, don't you worry about that, honey. I should have torn it down years ago. But you love sitting on that swing. We can fix it. What? Girl, I am old as the hills and she's big as a house. [laughs] No you're not, and we can do this. Ok. Right? We can do it. Give it to me. We can do it. Ok. And then will you forward the rest of my mail? Thank you. And I'll let you know when I'll be home. Now, I don't know what is more surprising. Seeing you here or what the heck is in that shopping cart. Uh... the pergola broke. Mmmhmm. And you thought you'd just fix it on your way out of town? No, I meant to come and tell you I wasn't leaving but um... I just... Hey, you alright? Lovie's sick. What? Um... I think she's dying. Oh, jeez, come here. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I had no idea. I'm sorry. I just feel like I wasted so many years being mad at her. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, stop that. Stop that. You're here now. And that's what matters. I just feel so helpless. Hmm. It doesn't look that easy to me. We're just gonna need some more tools. It's ok. Stand by, ladies. Flo has arrived. [laughter] What is that? Maybe this was a bad idea? If the wind doesn't blow too hard we'll be fine. So, what next, ladies? Where are you going? You'll see! Cara?! Where are you off to? I don't know. [laughs] Awe, look at you? Do you like it? Oh my gosh. Our newest turtle lady. Yes. Look at them, making their way to the ocean. Here they come. [clapping] Come on! Awe. He's so cute. My turtle girl. You're my turtle girl now. Here's another one. Two more. Oh my goodness. Sixty-seven hatchlings. Not bad. Are you ok? Yeah, just uh... wondering if you're still gonna leave. With mama Lovie like this and all. No, of course not. What about um... you know, after? Well, I'll go back to Chicago, and come visit you and the baby as much as possible. That'd be nice. Uh, I was in the neighbourhood, figured I'd finish her up. I hope you don't mind. Of course we don't mind, do we, Cara? It's still a little wet, so... Oh, my Lady Bank roses. How did you know? Uh, I didn't. The uh, nursery just dropped them off. I ordered them, mama. You remembered, Cara. Of course I did. Well, we'll have 'em climbing the pillars in no time. That sounds just wonderful. Maybe Cara will help you. Well, um, I've got an appointment in town and you ladies- An appointment for what? Oh, it's not a doctor, don't you worry about it. [country music playing] ♪ ♪ Toy looks so pretty in her new dress. It was sweet of you to take her shopping. Oh, it was nothing. She looks beautiful. You know, I have a ton of baby stuff up in the attic, I'm gonna send it right over. Oh no, I couldn't. Of course you could. I should have thought of it sooner. Silly me. ♪ ♪ I'm gonna go have a little talk with Palmer. Ok. Come on, Aunt Cara. Ok. Is Brett your boyfriend? What? No. Toy says you really like each other. Well yeah, he's my friend. You're burning the chicken. [laughs] Chicken's fine. Go talk to her. She's going to leave and then how will you feel? She left before and I was just fine. Really? 'Cause I remember you being pretty torn apart back then. We were kids. Come on. And now you're not. [laughs] You know, Flo, you bring a whole new meaning to the term "grilling". Oh, please. Alright, who's hungry? Food is on. Linnea and Cooper are having so much fun. Yeah, they are. You should bring them out here more often. Their sports and music. Their schedules are busier than mine. Besides, you'll be seeing plenty of them in Charleston. Mom, the house looks great. I see you got your roses back, too. It's good curb appeal. Curb appeal. Yeah. To sell the house. Did you forget what we talked about? Apparently you did. Don't get your feathers ruffled. Besides, you have your whole family all together, just the way you like us. I didn't wanna bring this up at the party but I went down to the bank to see Mr. Davis. Why would you bother doing that? I wanted to understand my financial situation. Mama, that's what you have me for. Mr. Davis gave me all the time I needed. What he couldn't explain is why there are so many withdrawals from my account that I never received. You're gonna get it all back. I can tell you where every penny- I don't want it back and you don't even have to explain. But I did ask Mr. Davis to transfer the rest of my funds into a new account which I will tend to. What? You haven't written a cheque yourself in 20 years. If I have any problems, which I won't, Cara has always had a fine head for numbers. I get it. She waltzes back down here after umpteen years of being gone, figures out the price of real estate down here- Palmer, stop. Dollars to doughnuts she starts coming down here every summer to get back to her roots- That won't be happening! I'll put money on it. Because I am not gonna be here. What? Where are you gonna go? Son. Mama, what? I have cancer. What're you sayin'? I'm really sorry, Palmer. There aren't gonna be anymore summers. I'm sorry, son. Mama, no. Linnea, Cooper, Julia, let's go. What? Babe? Palmer. Palmer? Let's go. Let's go, let's go. In the car. Palmer, honey, are you ok? [quiet sobs] Mama, are you ok? Oh, uh... he is such a fragile boy. You told him. Oh, I should have done it right away. That's what you would have done. You've always been upfront about things. Not always. My big life in Chicago? I kinda fell apart. Baby. I lost my job. Oh, but you are such a star. Well, apparently I've been out-shined. You know, all these years I thought I was running towards something but I think I've been running away. You've accomplished so much. Maybe on the outside. But on the inside I've been keeping everyone at arm's length. I thought I was being independent. One day you'll look back at your life and it'll all be clear. The only problem is, sometimes you realize it too late. Oh no, no, no. Go back! What's happening? They're confused. They're going in the wrong direction. They're supposed to go towards the reflection of the moon on the ocean. It's that house back there. Somebody tell those fools to cut their lights off! Let's just block the light for now. Just drop down. Get real close together. What do we do? Go back. Get closer so they don't go through. Ok, where is he? Oh, there he is. How are we gonna- Come on, go, go, go, go. There's your light. Who is that? Uh, it's Brett. We called him when we first noticed these hatchlings. See the light. They're turning around. Yes. Oh, it's working! Yes, yes, yes, yes! There you go. There you go. It worked. Just in the nick of time. Oh, he's taking off. Go! Go! Go, babies. To what do I owe the honour of this visit? Come and see her. At least call. I'm sure you've got everything under control. That's what you're good at, right? Y'all don't need me. Mama made that clear as crystal. What's gotten into you? She's sick- No. No, you don't get to go there, Cara. Who do you think's been here all those years when you just waltzed off, huh? I know. And I'm sorry. If I could change the past I would. Really? Would you? What about leaving me here to deal with him, huh? Would you do that again? I used to be so proud of you. 'Cause nobody could stand up to him like you. God knows I couldn't. And if I couldn't then mama definitely couldn't but you, you looked that old man right in his eye. Ain't that right, daddy? She could tell you all the things we were too scared to say. 'Til one day you just up and leave. Leave mom and I here holding the bag. I don't wanna fight with you. She needs you. [door closes] Well, hey there! Hey, Lovie. The rain's due in hard tonight. Figured I'd get these closed up for you before it hits. What would we do without you around here? Cara will be back soon in case you're wondering. Yeah. The only thing I'm thinkin' about right now is keeping you out of the rain, keeping you dry. Hey, Toy. Oh, hey. Not another one of these. Come on, we have a deal. Do they get better? They don't. You have your doctor's appointment today, I'll be happy to take you. I'm taking the bus today. Why? It's just a check-up. But there's that storm comin'. I've been through a storm or two. Besides, if I can't take care of myself for one afternoon how am I gonna take care of a baby? Good point. You just be careful. Hello ladies. Hey, Flo. Hey. Oh, not again. Want some? No. It gets in your teeth a little bit, but... I'll get you an iced tea. Thank you. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm not sure I'm in the right place. I'm looking for Cara Rudland. Uh, yeah, this is the place. She's out. Oh, man. Well, would you mind if I waited for her? I'm a friend from Chicago. Richard Devries. Richard. Brett. Brett, are you the handyman around here or something? Or somethin'. Ok. Richard? What're you doing here? Hey. You didn't return my calls. I wanted to come in person. Brett, this is- Richard. We met. Yeah. Can we go somewhere and talk, please? Unless you got plans. No plans here. Uh, tell Lovie I'm done with the shutters. Thank you. You seem different. I am different. Well, whatever it is, you look beautiful. You didn't come all the way down here to flatter me. That's one of the reasons. What's the other reason? Look, I know you're mad. I should have told you I was getting promoted. You didn't just get promoted. You got my promotion- I'm sorry about that. But look, that's all in the past. We got the Barclay account. We got your baby. And I let the partners know that it was all because of you. And they want you back as a senior VP and group director of the account. With a salary commensurate with all of that. My mom is sick. I wouldn't be able to start for a while, anyway. I can't. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. But look, we'll wait. Take all the time you need. But you know there's another reason I'm here, too. It's because I miss you. I really do. I want it in writing. How much I miss you? The offer. There's a storm coming in. You should leave now. [wind blowing] [rain pouring] Sarah? Sarah, ok you're next. Excuse me, hi. Um, do you know how much longer until the doctor can see me? When are you due? Uh, not for another three weeks. I'm sorry, sweetie. You'll have to wait with the others. It's a crazy day. I need to get home. [Coast Guard radio announcements] [radio] Another hurricane has arrived in the low country of South Carolina. Just in the last couple of hour rain falling sideways and winds gusting over 40 miles an hour. Today was the last day to prep or get out. Tonight South Carolina counting the hours until what could be a direct hit. [rain pouring hard] Mama, what're you doing? Have you packed your bags? We gotta go! Oh honey, I'm not leaving. Mom, it's a full-on hurricane. We're the last ones here. Your father, your brother, everyone is trying to get me out of this beach house. Oh honey, I have been through so many hurricanes. And this is just a little tropical storm. I'm not goin'. If you're staying, I'm staying. Cara. Mama, don't try and talk me out of it, you know how stubborn I am. Toy Sooner? Toy Sooner? [horns honking] I mean, they're offering to double my salary plus stock options. Wow. Pretty much everything I ever wanted. Congratulations. If this were a week ago I'd be mentally decorating my office right now. Well, you can decorate in person. Yeah. Mama, shouldn't Toy be back by now? Maybe I should go look for her. You'll do no such thing. She'll be fine. She's a smart girl, I'm sure she just stayed at the clinic. No, no, no, no, no! Hey Lovie, it's me. I'm on my way. I'm just worried about you. See you soon. [groaning] Lovie! Lovie! It's Flo! [knocking] Here let me help you. I broke the law but the tide was washing them away. What're you talking about? Oh, she removed the eggs from the nest. It's illegal, we'll put them back afterwards. Let 'em arrest us, right Flo? You got that right. [groaning in pain] Toy? [screaming in pain] Toy, you ok? Well, Caretta, this is quite the adventure. That's one way of putting it. Oh, this old cottage has been through worse. And so have we. I'm sorry for the way I left back then, mama. Oh honey, don't be. I have always loved your spirit and your backbone. Ever since you were a little girl. I wanted to see you fly as far, as high as you could. I wanted that for you as much as you did. Do you believe in soulmates? I'm sceptical. I know it's silly, I used to not believe in that stuff, either. Until I met Russell Bennett. I thought there was more to that story. Back then the dunes stretched as far as the eye could see. There was no development. The ocean, the salt air, our turtles and each other. It was only a summer but we spent every minute we could together without causin' people to talk. Why would people talk? He had a fiancé. He had made a commitment and I could see the agony that it caused him so I stepped away. Did he marry her? I got a letter from him. He said that he was flying to her house to break it off in person. What happened? His plane went down over the ocean. Engine failure. Ah, mama. When your father came along I was still numb inside. A part of me had died. This is the deed to a parcel of land that Russell left me. It was gonna be my wedding present. It's the dunes in front of the house where the turtles lay their eggs. I want you to have it, sweetheart. And this house, too. They're yours now. I just hope you come to find that the beach house is not so much a place as a state of mind. Oh my goodness, Toy! We were just gonna come look for you, honey. You had the baby! Are you alright? Yeah, we're ok. Brett took me to the hospital and spent the entire night in a chair. Yeah, and she should still be there, too. Practically fought her way out. Look, I'm gonna go check out your place, see how she held up. Come on. Mama. Palmer. I couldn't get through. I had to make sure you were ok. Oh, it was just a little old tropical storm. You made it through another one. Of course I did. Mama, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... Oh honey, it's ok. I should have been here for you. I love you. Oh, I love you. Well, I think I can salvage most of it. You know, southern ladies do need their pergola and roses. We do, don't we? We? Uh-huh. I'm not leaving. I'm sorry, I... you mean like, today? I mean like ever. This is my home right here. Lovie always said I'd look around one day and I would know what was right. Mmmhmm. This is right. [giggles] [kettle whistling] [coughs] There you go, mama. Oh thank you, baby. It's been such a nice summer, Cara. It's been the best. You're a good mama. I love you. I love you, sweetheart. You know, um... I feel a little chilly. If you could just get me a blanket. Of course. Hurry! You gonna let an old lady go faster than you? [laughing] Look! Woah, cool! Mama Lovie would have loved this. Oh, wow. Do you guys remember the scientific name for turtles? Caretta. [laughs] Look, there's another one. There's gonna be a bunch of them. Well, here's to a beautiful summer together. A lot can happen in the summer. Births, loss... Hurricanes. Turtles. Love. What? You're in love? Anyone I know? Just some guy who likes barbecue sauce. Sounds like quite a catch. He is. Come here.
