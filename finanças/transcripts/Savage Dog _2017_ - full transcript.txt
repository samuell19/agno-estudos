Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** There's a tale told somewhere south of Burma. It tells of one man's rendez-vous with death. A man who, when pushed far enough, retaliated. How he faced down an army and spill a river of blood. Naysayers shake their heads discounting the legend. But the fact remains... It's all true. I knew the man, and for a while, I loved him like a son. The French hightailed it in '54. And the US didn't yet have boots on the ground. For a while, Indochina offered safe-haven to men who had reached the end of the line. European war criminals, ex-Nazis, and other undesirables. Or men with a price on their head in the west. Men like... Martin Tillman. (HE'S GOOD) The tiger and the elephant, gentlemen. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Mr Rastignac, may I have the honor? My name is Jean-Pierre Rastignac. I have been known by many names. But the one that I most commonly associate with, is "The Executioner". I face you as an equal, with the exception of this blade, we're quite fairly matched. They told me if I fought, I would go free. This fight was your salvation, But you lost. (GREAT! I LIKE THAT) You shouldn’t have done that to the Corporal. I asked the guards, why a colonial police station, with only one small jail would keep a prisoner for three years? They said, only you knew the answer. Most prisoners who end up here, have no hope. I thought I might help... You come twice a week with flowers for him? And he turns you away? I can bring you fruit. The food here is not healthy. I don't need your help. Don't waste your time on me. You're not a waste of time. You're just lost. I'll come see you again, in case you change you change your mind. That agent is here again. He is persistent. I can kill him if you order it. The world is changing, Boon. We must adapt with it. Isn't it your job to transition the local police into power? The side effect being that for a brief few years you need to beholden to the authority of the French. Not the Vietnamese. Mr Harrison, what can I do for you? Ho Chi Min's strength in the North grows as President Diem's influence in the South diminishes. The Americans are watching and will send more advisers within a year. You and your kind will have to find a different fleapit to lord over. Perhaps... I might be a valuable assistance to you when they arrive. At what price to me? MI6 would like to extradite Martin Tillman to face criminal charges in Great Britain. There's no-one of that name here. You're overlooking a potential opportunity here, Colonel. I know what you did in the war. You'll need a friend like me if you're gonna deal with the Americans. Corporal Chef Boon, please escort Mr Harrison out. When I was a little girl, I rescued a stray dog. A fighting dog that had been left for dead. I look at those black eyes. and felt the ultimate betrayal. Some animals are not meant to be caged, Martin. Why are you talking to me? You made some bad decisions, - that's all. - Mademoiselle. I'll be back next week. Good-bye. Why do you bother coming back for him? We build our own cages, Martin. Alcohol is an easy paracil here. Like Jamaican rum. It'll help you forget your sins, without losing your edge. You assaulted a superior officer in '53. You've served three years of a six month sentence. What does that tell you? Tells me that I'm not the only criminal in this room. In the North you're just an ex-legionnaire, with a price on his head. In the South you're just another ex-con. With no passport. That tattoo is a writ of judgment against you. An execution warrant in Great Britain. You're not so dissimilar to us. Take... Señor Rastignac, Spanish Blue Division, fought heroically for the Third Reich, Corporal Chef Boon of the Fifth Vietnamese Paratroopers. Once a hero, now hunted by the Viet Minh as a traitor. And Señor Amarillo, Loyal to Pertain, and fought until the end of Berlin. Santé! This room is full of men who backed the wrong horses, indeed. I'm feeling charitable. So... I'm fulfilling my obligation to you. I'm paroling you. Effective immediately. Are you saying I'm free to go? Our glorious run together is over. For most of us, Indochina will be our last outpost. But perhaps we can work together again under different circumstances. If you ever find yourself in Spode, I can always use a man with a talent like yours. I think I'll just be moving along. Think about it, Martin. You don't look like a man with many opportunities. You owe me now. You ever see me again, don't you dare presume to forget that. Are you sure this is wise? I want that British agent out of my affairs. The old Colonel was right. Martin wouldn't go far. He headed to the only person he knew outside of the camp; which is where I met him. This is Martin, the one I was telling you about. I have to leave now, I want the two of you to be friends. It's nice seeing you again, Martin Tillman. There was once an Irish boxer named Tillman, showed potential, then disappeared. Looked after her since she was knee-high with a jack rabbit. She believes in the good in man. I don't. Tell me where I can get a meal and I'll be leaving. I have no beef with you, son, and I could use a good bouncer. You look like you can handle yourself. She says you're straight shooter. When I was inside, she'd visit every week. Always bringing flowers for the Commandant. You don't know? God bless her innocent heart. Give me the picture. I'll be damned if that old flesh merchant, Hans Steiner is her own father. Take some flowers once a week, in the hope that he'll sit her on his knee and kiss her cheek. He refuses to see her. Steiner married his Kong gai, local girl, whom he later suspected of deceiving him. When Isabelle was born, that gave him sufficient reason to... deny her. I was Steiner's valet, saw the whole thing. Adopted Isabelle. She deserves better than either of us. You ever hurt Isabelle, I'll kill you faster than I can shank a salmon. And that's damn quick, boy. There's an old storage shed out back you can bunk in. You'll mostly deal with drunks. Every so often some lame duck paws a girl. They get one polite request. Then, do whatever it takes. Xie-xie. Thank you. That'll do it. You know, you're just like I was, Martin. But you ain't so old, you can still change your path. I'm nothing like you. I'm young, handsome, and I burn in the sun. You, son of a bitch! Well, I have to say... You're the only person in my whole life who went out of his way to help me. I appreciate that. Even the worst of us wants to be loved, and for a time, Martin enjoyed a peace he'd never known before. Bow! Valentine! Sweet lil' emoti... Merry! Sweet lil' emot... He was a free prisoner, She was an innocent, who would watch her injured patient limp back to life. It was only natural that they would develop feelings for each other. I'm not sure if Valentine'd like... Is that what you believe in? No, I was never a believer. I joined the fight because... My Dad and my brother went ahead of me. Where I come from, that's just what you did. Your home is here now, Martin Tillman. Leave the past behind. It was a shame as I told you last night, you fucked a penguin. You know, it's so damned easy to get so wrapped up in life that you miss the precious moments like this. Toast to the future! The future! Well we damn sure ain't drinking to the past! We're not going back to where we have been before. - Cheers. - Cheers. No, seriously, Jack, I was out in New York Two weeks. Tell me what? Have you broken your hands? How could I have broken my hands? I'd become a fucking beggar. Fair enough. Never let it go. (INDISTINCTIVE) Get the fuck out of here! Who's this cunt think he is, huh? You got somethin' to say to our lads? There's a pretty penny out there for legion deserters. You know that? You look like a fellow who likes a good tear up. Well, you know what? This is your lucky day son, cos so do I. Listen! Is that your knees I hear knocking? Go home! If the idea is to have a fight, there's your fucking chance. Martin! That's enough! You did your job! - I told you I'm fine, OK? - You're not fine. - I'm fine! - Turn your head. Turn your head. You're a big baby. Now it makes sense. We're closed, come back tonight. My country, my laws. My revolver. Martin and I are old friends. Care if I sit down? Not my call. Thank you. Isabelle, you better go. Come on. Does she still believe she's Steiner's daughter? She is Steiner's daughter. A great expense our mutual friend Colonel Steiner flew in a champion boxer. Last night, someone knocked him on cold. I decided I should meet the responsible party. Mr Valentine told you we're closed. Why don't you come back tonight? You just burned the most dangerous man in Indochina. Right now you need me more than anyone else in the world. Why don't you come back and fight for us? Steiner had the British agent sent North. So... You can make some money. Life can be good. I'll take my chances here if it's all the same with you. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Steiner needs to relocate his operation. A bar like this would be a perfect fit. Not my favourite customer. We're closing early tonight. I brought you bad luck. Bad luck resides in our own conscience. We inflict it on ourselves. It seems to find me. Listen to me, son. I saw something inside you out there in the rain. Maybe you need to stop running away from it. Embrace it. Martin! I didn't think you'd be up this early. I'll pray for you. I want you to promise me something. Don't ever watch me fight. Or bet on me or... be any part of what happens to me when I get into that ring. I don't understand. Something happens to me in there... It's a part of me I don't want you to see. I bring bad luck to the people around me. Martin Tillman. I've considered your offer, and... I believe I'll take you up on it... Well, that wasn't so difficult, was it? That's right! The champion's here! OK! He's here! And who's gonna win? Yes! The champ! Let's go! Let's go! Martin Tillman! What can I get you? Gin and tonic, highball, old boy. 3 oz of gin to 4 oz of tonic water splashed of lemon, if you have it. Think I could find some lemon juice somewhere? I've been in the North. It's refreshing to hear English spoken again. Diplomatic service? You might say that. I'm looking for an Irishman. A boxer. He was here but now he's gone. There are a hundred local criminals in this vicinity. Nazis on the run, murderers, wanted war criminals. What's with this guy? In 1946, Martin Tillman set up several large bombs targeting RUC and B-Special Units. We know he was working with his father and brother who were part of the flying column for the IRA. But as they were killed in one of the blasts, he's our loose end, you might say. Can't help you. Well, if he does turn up, you can find me via the British Embassy. You look like a man that could do with £10,000. The reward money for information expediting his apprehension. D'you know what £10,000 looks like in French Piastres, Mr Valentine? Get up! Get up! Come on! Get up! I hear... You give your money to Valentine. You ever wonder how you would do in a regular boxing match? Big money in America. Madison Square Garden. Imagine that. I used to know people, politicians, investors, but I am SS Steiner. And you... are IRA Tillman. I was sentenced to death by a War Tribunal in absentia. And you have the British Secret Service hunting you. So, all that we shall ever be is this. What we are right now. Dearest Isabelle, I'm sorry I have not been in touch. I deeply, profoundly loved your mother. And I'm sure what you would really wish for me to say is that, well that, I love you too. Well... Unfortunately, I do not. For you are, at best, the daughter of a whore. and deserve no such dignity for your wishful thinking. I was blinded by my own lust and inexperience. I could never love a daughter of the woman who made a cuckold out of me. You are nothing but another faceless, vermin inhabitant this festering waste-land. Cordially, Hans Steiner. How you doing? Oh, we're winning so far. There was a British agent here asking after you. Figured he'd catch up to me, eventually. The money is good, Martin, but I don't need it. Neither does Steiner. You can quit when you want. That's my military passport. You can put your picture on it. - Steiner won't like th... - Forget Steiner! Take the money from tomorrow's fight. Go to America, take Isabelle with you. You're as good as back in jail here. And you don't even know it. Go to the States, get away, taste real freedom. What about you? I'll head South with my girl, she's got family down there. I'll do the next fight, and I have to weeks til the next one. That'll give us time to get out of 'em. Whatever wrong you've done, Doesn't matter to anybody. Until you decide, to go on living. 100,000 French Piastres. That's the biggest pot you've ever taken. However, no-one is betting against you, so... The odds are no longer worthwhile, so... You want me to lose the fight? That was easy. I told you there'd be no problem. You give me a quarter of the gate, I'll make it a fucking work of art. You better make it look real. You learnt a thing for yourself, Martin, that's good. Lose well, Martin Tillman, your life depends on it. I know, I know, strictly speaking, I promised I wouldn't gamble. But it's a sure thing. But I did my research on this guy, Martin will tear him apart. We'll go South to your family. We'll buy a bar, a bigger one. Thailand, maybe, yeah. When the Europeans start arriving, the Americans will be next. And we'll be in a great position to make some money. How much did you gamble? Don't you worry your pretty little head about it. (Speaks Chinese) Wait, wait, wait! Just wait a minute! This evening, many people found out that their great hero has no honor. They're in the bar waiting for you. Look, look, look! Here come our gentlemen now. OK, fellas? How did I do? You lost. What? You have until the end of the week to vacate. The deed to this property, everything and everything inside, now belongs to Monsieur Rastignac Martin lost? You knew? You knew he was going to lose but he let Valentine gamble? You son of a bitch! Watch your tongue, black. You don't wanna upset me. You're awful! All of you, cowardy cheats. Not one of you has a thing up to your bearing on Valentine. You should be ashamed. You and your pig. Knock it off! That's enough! You've taken enough from us tonight. Don't take anything more. It ends here! And no Spaniard in a cheap suit with a paid-off contract is gonna take anymore. You understand? Put it down, Valentine. It's not fair. You're not a killer. What are you doing? Everything OK, Valentine? So, there you have it. Killed by three slugs with my own 45. Everything just ceased to matter. Not my life, the bar, anything. I just signed off. It was a different story with Martin and Isabelle. The thing about a sawn-off shotgun is it's sheer hell at close range. But over a throw, not so much. The force of the hit dropped Martin, knocked him cold, but it had missed everything vital. Likewise with Isabelle, the 45 that had finished me, passed right through her. She was a healthy, young woman. And now, it's said the human is the hardest animal to kill. Martin had never had much call for religion. But there in the jungle he reacquainted himself with his Maker. He begged God to let him die there. To take his life in exchange for saving hers. He offered God a proposal, if she died, he'd follow her into the twilight kingdom. But if she lived, it would become his mission to quench with death those responsible for what had happened. She deserves better than either of us. I bring bad luck to the people around me. Bad luck resides in our own conscience. We inflict it on ourselves. Though it broke his heart, Martin knew he could never see her again. It had never been so God damned clear as it was then. He would have to kill them all, only then could it end. Steiner, Rastignac, Amarillo and Boon. Just four men were in Martin's mind. Four reasons his life had been destroyed. (SPEAKS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKS FRENCH) And I heard a voice, in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him. I'm looking for Rastignac and Steiner. Why? Rastignac and Steiner. (SPEAKS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Don't go inside. No fight. Cognac for you. Martin! Give him a drink! No, no, give him the good stuff! See? The thing that Martin knew that they didn't was, that in a bar fight, the man with nothing to lose, was the man to bet on. I'm gonna kill you. And if your men try to stop me, I'll fucking kill them too. A wise man once said: "Fear the hanged man because he's dead already". Martin Tillman is still alive. He walked in Valentine's bar with just a machete, killed everyone! They had machine guns, shotguns, Steiner! He kept them down like they weren't even there. Like a demon. A fighter, you killed that bear, it has come back to life. I'll just find him and kill him again. You would allow it for the gentle rule of exaggeration. I'd say we have a problem on our hands. Are you afraid, Steiner? You're getting old. Let's just say I'm not taking any chances. I'll kill anyone I find to be a threat. But he can't do anything to us. What can he do to us? He'll go after our money, that's where I would strike first. Our money is at my safe, at the villa. I have to stay here. There's a full squad there, they're armed. You'll be fine. No, I'm deeply sorry, I'm not going. I am not going. Take Constantine, he'll take care of you. Constantine? (SPEAKS FRENCH) Go home. Louis XIII's cognac. Nearly a century old. an excellent choice for this occasion. He'd had to be out of his mind to come here. If he does, I'll kill him. Then I'll buy dinner as an apology for this inconvenience. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Kill him! You go! You go! Martin, there is enough for both of us, look! We can get out of this. Look! I've been prepared to die, so many times in my life. This man is so repugnant. A man should go before his Maker properly attired. Today we're mobilizing an entire strike force to keep one man from entering a police station. Consider him deceased, my friend. Let's go! What would you think of me? For as long as he could remember, Martin had been fighting. Whether it was harassing the English, hunting the Viet Minh or even knocking fellas down for money. Martin had fought for many things. But never for revenge. Revenge was pure, it was simple and it would allow almost any means to achieve its end. No matter how ruthless. Now, it wasn't as though Martin had any premonition or innate strategic knowledge. He just figured, it wasn't a good plan to go through the front door. Grenade! No, not that easy. Go! Go! go! The corridor! He's coming in the front door! Min! Go! Marc will stay here. Pussies. Take it! Look at this face. Look into my eyes! Do you think I've never faced that before? Better men than you have tried. I will not... I will not allow you the satisfaction. You're a scum that got lucky for a day or two. I... am an aristocrat. I was a fighter once. Let's see how good you are. I have no fight with you. You're wrong. This place was my life. I supported my parents, my wife, my children... Now I have nothing. I can't help you with that. There's a price on your head, Irishman. That's good enough. Turn the guns around, he's coming! It's not until you face death, that you truly appreciate life. Wait for him to leave cover, then fire on my command. What are you doing, Martin? Fire! Cease fire! Pierre, go check on the target. The rest of you be ready to provide cover and fire on my command. Never send a boy to do a man's job. Señor Artignac, where are you going? Give me your gun! He's fighting a commitment. To the building, now! You wanna live or you wanna die? I wanna live! Losing your appetite for blood, Martin? Not really. Not many men I've granted the opportunity to duel for their life. (THEY SPEAK A FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Bedfellows like money and power billet together. Rastignac had lost his money, and all of his influence along with it. With no collateral, He was just another no-account European of innate depravity. Rastignac's treatment of the locals, had earned him many enemies amongst the natives. Word had spread of Martin's quest to avenge the local girl... earning him great sympathy. With Rastignac's soldiers gone, his fortune lost, it would be man against man, just the way Martin wanted it. The matador's relationship with the bull is closer than with anyone. They both know that only one of them will leave the ring alive. You won, Martin. I'm not running anymore. It's empty. Let's do this like gentlemen. My name is Jean-Pierre Rastignac. I have been known by many names. But the one with which I most commonly associate, is "The Executioner". I face you as an equal, with the exception of this blade, we're quite fairly matched. This is for Valentine. Watch me. Dearest Isabelle, I trust you're well. I'm sorry I have not been in touch. I deeply, profoundly loved your mother. And I'm sure what you would really wish for me to say is that, I love you too. It's been some time, Martin. We can make the railroad in Saigon by 4 PM. Take the train to the airport. We can be in London in two days where you'll stand trial for murder. But you'll probably kill me first. So... What? You can work for me. I've been ordered to assemble a team of local operatives. Men with your skills are a commodity, Tillman. Indochina is changing, and so must we. Christ never gave him much. but a God-awful talent for carnage and death. There was no need for him to deny it now. He was a killer, and that's all there was to it. And so was born... The Legend. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***
