THANK YOU. SO I GUESS THIS IS HOW AMERICA FIRST SAW ME, SINGING MY "HIT..." BUT MY TALENTS WERE FIRST REVEALED TO MY MOTHER IN HER BEDROOM, IN THE EARLY '60s, IN ENGLAND. NOW, MY DAD DIED IN 1966, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE, AND WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. IT WASN'T LIKE AMERICA. THERE WAS NO GRIEF COUNSELING, THERE WAS NO THERAPY, YOU KNOW? NO, IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT. HERE'S ME THE YEAR IT HAPPENED. Audience: AWW. OH, I LOOK LIKE A TROLL! I DO. I LOOK LIKE A TROLL, LIKE A LITTLE TROLL IN MOURNING. YEAH. I REALLY WANTED TO CHEER EVERYBODY UP. SO AT NIGHT I USED TO STAND ON THE WINDOWSILL IN MY MOTHER'S BEDROOM, AND PUT ON A SHOW. ( whispering ) ARE YOU READY, MOMMY? ARE YOU READY? ♪ HELLO, EVERYBODY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW ♪ ♪ THAT THIS IS ME, AND THIS IS MY SHOW ♪ ♪ AND ON THE SHOW ♪ ♪ WE HAVE TONIGHT... ♪ EDITH PIAF! ( singing in French ) MY MOM WOULD GO, "WOW, IT'S AMAZING! SHE'S SINGING IN FRENCH. SHE'S NEVER HAD A LESSON." AND ALSO ON OUR SHOW TONIGHT, MOMMY, IS... OUR NEIGHBOR, MISS COX IN HER WELLINGTON BOOTS. ( smacks lips ) ZUZU, ZUZU. HAVE YOU SEEN MY CAT, MRS. ULLMAN? OH, MY FIANCE DIED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR, AND I'M GOING TO DIE A VIRGIN. AND I ALWAYS HAVE A DEWDROP ON THE END OF MY NOSE WHICH I WIPE OFF WITH A GREY HANDKERCHIEF. SEE, THIS IS MISS COX, ONE OF MY FIRST CHARACTER STUDIES. WHY DID I WANT TO IMITATE HER? WHY DIDN'T I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY GLAMOROUS? OH, ALL RIGHT. YES, MOMMY. AND ALSO ON THE SHOW TONIGHT... DAME MARGO FONTAINE ( lisping ) WOULD LIKE TO DANCE TO "CAST YOUR--" I HAD A REALLY BAD LISP AT THIS TIME-- ( lisps ) "CAST YOUR FATE TO THE WIND." ( record crackles ) ( whimsical piano music plays ) ( grunts, pants ) ( rock music plays ) YAH, YAH! AM I TALENTED, MOMMY? AM I CHEERING YOU UP? MOMMY, MOMMY, LOOK, I CAN DO THE SPLITS! MOMMY, LOOK, I CAN DO THE SPLITS! - LOOK, MOMMY! - ( audience cheering, applauding ) - ( record skipping ) - OH, NO! OH, NO! OH... NO, MOM, NO. - OH, OH... - ( record stops ) NO, MOMMY, MOMMY, PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED YET. DON'T MAKE ME GO TO BED. CAN I DO YOUR HAIR? CAN I DO YOUR HAIR? I KNOW, MOMMY, MOMMY, I'LL DO IMPERSONATIONS. HOW ABOUT, MOMMY, EVA GABOR FROM "GREEN ACRES" WHEN SHE GOES, "OH, DARLING, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH ALL THIS LAND?" OR MOMMY, MOMMY! ANNA MAGNANI! YOU KNOW, I WANT A HORSE. YOU KNOW? I WANT A HORSE, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW? MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY! JULIE ANDREWS. BUT CAPTAIN, THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN. MOM-- BED, GO TO BED. SO... I'D STAND IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND TALK TO MYSELF UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP, YOU KNOW? I'D INTERVIEW MYSELF AS WOMEN WITH PROBLEMS, LIKE WOMEN-- ( chuckles ) WOMEN IN DOCUMENTARIES WHO HAD THREE KIDS, AND CHAIN-SMOKED, AND HUSBANDS IN PRISON THAT HIT THEM, YOU KNOW? I'LL BE LIKE IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR GOING, ( in deep voice ) "YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW... IT'S NOT EASY SINCE DARREN WENT INTO PRISON. MY EYES AREN'T BLACK ANYMORE, BUT THE TWINS, KELLY AND WAYNE, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T STOP CRYING. ( yells ) SHUT UP, KELLY! SHUT UP, KELLY! AND THERE'S FUNGUS IN THE BABY'S CRIB. YEAH YEAH, THE CAMERA CAN SEE IT. AND WE'VE GOT RATS IN THIS APARTMENT, THAT HAVE GIVEN US THE BUBONIC PLAGUE. NO, I'M NOT JO-- - AND THEN I'D HEAR... - Mother: TRACY, STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF! SHUT UP! GO TO BED! BUT I LOVE TALKING TO MYSELF! WHAT ELSE COULD I DO, YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS, 'CAUSE I HATED BEING A KID, MY DAD HAD DIED, AND THEN MY MOM WENT AND MARRIED A REALLY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MAN WHO DROVE A TAXI AT NIGHT. HE HAD A STICKY-FINGERED SON, AND HE SMOKED CIGARS IN THE TOILET. OOH! THE SMELL WAS TERRIBLE! AGAIN, THERE'S NO THERAPY, THERE'S NO COUNSELING OVER THE WHOLE SITUATION. SHE JUST MARRIED THE MANIAC. THERE WAS A NEW PERSON IN HER BED NOW. AND I COULDN'T DO MY NIGHTLY PERFORMANCE ANYMORE. Audience: AWW-WW. I WAS NINE YEARS OLD, AND MY SHOW HAD BEEN CANCELED. ALL MY FAMILY DID WAS DRINK. YEAH. NOW IT'S ALL LIKE, "OOH... WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE KIDS THIS WEEKEND? HOW CAN WE SHOW THEM THEY'RE SPECIAL?" ALL WE EVER HEARD WAS THE WHACK OF THE ICE CUBE TRAY - ( ice crackling ) - AS THEY MIXED MORE VODKA AND ORANGE JUICE, AND US KIDS WERE TOLD TO GO OUT AND PLAY. "OH, GO OUT AND PLAY!" I WORE WHITE HOT PANTS AT THIS TIME. ( laughs ) IT'S A BIT OF AN EARLY CAMEL TOE HERE, LET'S FACE IT. ( laughs ) IT IS. IT'S POSITIVELY LABIAL, LET'S BE HONEST. AND I STILL LOOK LIKE A TROLL, BUT I WAS A TROLL WITH TRIANGULAR ADOLESCENT BREASTS. LOOK, THE LITTLE TRIANGULARS STARTING UP HERE, LOOK. YEAH. I THOUGHT, "OH, NOTHING WONDERFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME OR MY BREASTS. AND THEN... ( chuckles ) ONE DAY SOMETHING HAPPENED TO GIVE ME HOPE. WE WERE SELLING OUR HOUSE BY THE RIVER, AND THIS REALLY NICE MIDDLE-CLASS LADY AND HER HUSBAND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, AND SHE ASKED IF THEY COULD LOOK AROUND, AND I SAID, "OOH, WELL... I DON'T THINK IT'S CONVENIENT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE BUSY THROWING THEMSELVES UP AGAINST THE WALL IN A DRUNKEN RAGE. SO, ANYWAY, AS I'M SHUTTING THE DOOR, THE WOMAN GASPED AND SHE SAID, "OH, MY DEAR!" SHE SAID, "DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?" SHE SAID, "YOU HAVE A STAR ABOVE YOUR HEAD." WHAT?! AND SHE SAID, "FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME, I'M A PSYCHIC, AND I KNOW THESE THINGS," SHE SAID, "AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY FAMOUS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AMERICA." ( chortles ) MY GOD! REALLY, IT WAS AMAZING. AND THEN MY STEPBROTHER SAID, "WHAT ABOUT ME?" SHE SAID, "OH, YOU'LL HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT FUTURE AHEAD OF YOU, DEAR. YOU'LL GET A GIRL PREGNANT WHEN YOU'RE 15, LIVE IN A TRAILER PARK, AND PASS ON YOUR FLAT-FOOTEDNESS TO YOUR UNBORN CHILD, AND NO, IT'S THE GIRL WITH THE STAR ABOVE HER HEAD." ( chortles ) IT'S MY STAR! THANK YOU. THANK YOU, NICE CLAIRVOYANT LADY, WHOEVER YOU WERE, AND WHEREVER YOU ARE NOW, THANK YOU FOR GIVING A YOUNG ADOLESCENT TROLL WITH A GIFT FOR MIMICRY... HOPE! AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED TO GIVE ME HOPE. I HAD THIS BRILLIANT HEADMASTER AT STEPGATE COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL CALLED RONALD HARDING. AND HE THOUGHT I WAS SUCH A STANDOUT IN MY SCHOOL PRODUCTIONS THAT I SHOULD TRY OUT FOR A SPECIAL SCHOOL. I THOUGHT HE MEANT A PLACE FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENTS BUT HE MEANT A PERFORMING ARTS ACADEMY. OOH! I IMAGINED ALL THESE TALENTED KIDS SINGING, DANCING, ACTING, WEARING LEOTARDS, CARRYING THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE, BREAKING INTO FABULOUS SPONTANEOUS DANCE ROUTINES IN THE HALLWAYS, A LA "FAME"... WHILE DOING "RICHARD III." THE ITALIA CONTI STAGE SCHOOL WAS NOT REALLY LIKE THAT. ( reggae music plays ) IT WAS IN A SOUTH LONDON HELLHOLE CALLED CLAPHAM NORTH. GANGS SHOT AT US FROM THE BALCONIES OF THEIR GOVERNMENT HOUSING BLOCKS. - HEY-- - ( gunshot ) ( gasping ) OH, NO, VIVIAN'S DOWN! ( gasps ) SHE'S BLEEDING THROUGH HER TUTU. VIVIAN, VIVIAN, PLEASE, TRY AND MAKE IT. - ( siren blaring ) - THE AMBULANCE IS COMING. AND THE CHILDREN WHO WENT TO ITALIA CONTI WEREN'T NECESSARILY TALENTED, BUT THEIR MOTHERS TOLD THEM THEY WERE. THAT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE GANGS. THEY WERE ALL LIKE, "MY BENITA'S GOT LONGER LEGS THAN YOUR PETRINA. YES. SHE'S BEEN IN A BARBIE COMMERCIAL, THE JAMMY DODGER COOKIE CAMPAIGN, AND SHE DOUBLED FOR THE GIRL IN 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG,' WHEN THE CAR WENT OVER THE CLIFF." AND THE AUDITIONS THEY SENT US ON-- UGH! IT WAS LIKE CATTLE CALLS FOR KIDS. WE USED TO GET LINED UP ON LONDON'S WEST END STAGES, AND THEY'D DO REVIVALS ( chortles ) OF "FLOWER DRUM SONG" AND "SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS," AND, ETHNICALLY, I FIT INTO NOTHING. THERE'S NO MUSICALS ABOUT YOUNG TROLLS, ARE THERE? INSENSITIVE DIRECTORS PICKED US KIDS OUT FROM THE LINEUP. "OKAY, YOU STEP FORWARD, YOU STEP FORWARD, AND YOU." ( pants ) HE POINTED RIGHT AT ME, THE DUSKY TROLL ALL IN BLACK. I TOOK HALF A STEP FORWARD, AND HE SAID, "NO NO NO NO! NOT YOU, NOT YOU! THE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL NEXT TO YOU." OH. UGH, IT WAS SO PAINFUL! I'LL NEVER FORGET THE HUMILIATION, YOU HORRIBLE '70s ENGLISH QUEEN... WITH YOUR CLIPBOARD AND YOUR BULGY STUFFED WILLY! AND I THOUGHT, IS THIS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT? DO YOU HAVE TO BE BLONDE AND GIRLIE AND HAVE THE FRECKLES AND A SNUB NOSE AND ACT THE COQUETTE IN SHOW BUSINESS? ( screams ) WELL, YES! MY BEST FRIEND ROSEMARY WAS BLONDE. SHE GOT A LOT MORE ATTENTION. YEAH, SHE HAD A LOVELY BEDROOM ALL FULL OF DESIGNER CLOTHES, AND HER LEOTARD NEVER GOT STUCK IN THE CRACK OF HER BUM WHEN SHE DID A PLIE. BUT MINE IS LIKE-- IS GOING IN AND OUT. IT-- ( gulps ) IT DIGESTED IT. YOU COULD HEAR IT! UGH. SO... I STAYED FOUR YEARS AT CONTI'S. I GREW REALLY ANTI-BLONDE, AND I SMOKED IN THE TOILETS, - ( billiard balls clack ) - AND I PLAYED POOL IN THE PUB NEXT DOOR. I JUST LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED. ( sniggers ) DO YOU SEE HER? SHE'S BLONDE. STUPID BITCH, STUPID BITCH. SHE'S GOT SPOTS, SHE'S GOT SPOTS. GIVE US A SWIG O' OF BEAR, MATE. SUDDENLY, ALL MY FRIENDS HAD LEFT SCHOOL, AND I WAS IN THE PUB ON ME OWN. BLOODY 'ELL. I'M 16. IT'S TIME TO GET A JOB. Man: TIME, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. SO-- ( audience cheering ) OH, YEAH. ( laughs ) ME AT 16. LOOK-- OH, GOD. I COULD DANCE IN A SORT OF SEMI-PROFESSIONAL WAY BY THEN-- BALLET, JAZZ TAP, I GAVE IT PLENTY. I COULDN'T ROLLER-SKATE, I MUST ADMIT. ( laughs ) THEY WERE JUST A FUN YOUNG PROP. SO, MY RIGHT LEG'S STIFF-- WAS STIFF, BUT MY LEFT, WELL... ( audience cheering ) THAT COULD KNOCK ME OUT. SO I PULLED MY LEG WARMERS UP, I APPLIED A TON OF LIP GLOSS, AND I AUDITIONED FOR A REGIONAL ENGLISH DANCE SHOW. - OKAY. - ( slow piano music plays ) ( whispers ) HI. I'M SORRY. ( softly ) OH FUCK. NOT AS MANY PEOPLE HERE AS I THOUGHT. Man: FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT... - ( upbeat piano music plays ) - THE OTHER GIRLS AREN'T REALLY THAT GOOD LOOKING AND KICK ON THE LEFT, AND I MAKE UP FOR IT IN PERSONALITY, SMILE, SHAKE, AND LEAP.

THE NO-PANTY CLAUSE IS STRICTLY UPHELD IN THE DANCE WORLD. BUT YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO DANCE ANYMORE ANYWAY. I WASN'T EARNING ANY MONEY, THERE WERE NO STRAIGHT GUYS, AND MY RIGHT LEG HAD NEVER REALLY WORKED. OH, NO, I'M NOT DOING THAT.
