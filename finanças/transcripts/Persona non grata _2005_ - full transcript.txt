I mean it: No way. [Door knocking] Who is it? Come in. - Are the funeral parlour men here? - Mm-lhm. Olh... Tell them to get down to worlk. I agree, but it's too early. It's not a good time. I mean it. Just a second. - Nine o' clock, Moscow. - Nine o' clock there. - What about the funeral? - At I l AM. Departure at 4PM, back in Moscow at 8PM, buy the ticket. A business ticket? No. One moment. - Is it a two-way service? - It will be for you. We humbly entrust sister Helena... ...God... ...and aslk you to free her soul... ...from all the evil. Let her rest in eternal peace. [People standing up] [Siglhs] Excuse me. - thanlk you. - All riglht... So? Can you still spealk Polislh? Not much, but I can still remember a few words. - I've already lost my faith that you'd come one day. - As usual. You don't trust anybody. My airplane was three hours late, I will have to be leaving soon. - Soon? - In 40 minutes. What a slhame, I hoped we would be able to tallk a little bit. And for that to happen, we would need a Whole niglht and a few bottles of vodlka. We will, in Uruguay. I'll bring a vodlka, I'm going to officially be in Montevideo soon. Listen, I know you miglht not be eager to tallk about it but... Ihow did it happen? I heard it happened completely out of a sudden? You know. Helena... ...returned to the country because slhe had a very higlh blood pressure. Nothing unusual. But then. A strolke, out of the blue. Slhe'd been lying at home for two days, unconscious, without anybody suspecting anything. Slhe didn't even malke it to the hospital. And What were I doing? Sitting, of course, in Uruguay. [Siglhs with disbelief] [The Russian person] You know... [uses a combination of Russian and Polislh language] One could say: Slhe's had a painless death. You know, we have a certain prayer in Poland: "From sudden and unexpected death, o Lord, save us!" [The Russian person] Mm-hmm. I... at first I didn't understand Why people would say something lilke that. But now... ...now I understand. I feel, I could have prepared myself for this. We've had so many things left to discuss. And now, nothing. For example, I wanted to ask her about you. Whether... ...there was something... [interrogatively]... between you or not. And now, Who's going to tell me that? You are? What is it that you want to know? - the truth. - What truth? Like a confession? - What confession? - At the temple or clhurclh. You with your KGB, or we with our UB - it didn't matter, all of us had to confess. So many years have passed and you're still protesting. You always find something wrong. You're old, remember about that. That's true, I was born with that protest gene. - What do you protest against? - Everything. Against the world, the life. Against you. - And myself. - Because of that goddamn protest... you've become a tiny dissident, instead of a famous musicologist. Once we used to believe that we could clhange the world! - And so you did. - Seems we slhould have clhanged it more. You released a lot of steam but the train didn't move at all. Do you regret that? Did you have somebody write that speeclh for you? Say, you must have talken it from someWhere. - Do you have a glhost writer? - Four of them. I'm sorry. I have to go, see you in Montevideo. Here you go. You have to call me. Farewell. I wislh I didn't have to go. I'll confess to you in Montevideo, I promise. Helena used to like him. Slhe believed he was sincerely interested in Solidarnosc. He was sincerely deliglhted with her and franlkly used to inform on her. Do you thinlk he had something to do with... ...Iher getting busted for the second time? How's your health? Fine. Why are you... aslking? I don't know if you still want to worlk for the institution... ...or would rather want to return to the country. - I don't know it myself. I'll try to continue my worlk. - Great, great. [Uses improper Polislh grammar] But maybe there is something I could help you out with? You said that with suclh an resemblance to the Englislh equivalent: "May I help you?" [lauglhter] You could help me... ...with the boy. I want you to send him up to me as a consul. Yes, Yes, I remember. He came back from Russia with wife. I'll clheck Whether there are any problems with that. - That's the main reason I wanted to tal... [phone calling] Slhit. [Groans] [Plhone calling] [Document cases falling from the deslk] [Plhone calling] [Plhone calling] Prime Minister's office. I understand. thanlk you. [Hanging up the plhone] [Murmuring] Yes... By accident I noticed that it's a denunciation from my institution. Yes but it was intended for me. Restricted delivery, get a brealk! - It was sent for the sake of rules. - Rules? What rules?!. Hulh? For the salke of rules I am not supposed to know that my worlker - a former informer... ...informs on me that I drinlk? that I'm crazy?!. that he dares to inform me at the moment everything just screws up?!. the moment my wife suddenly dies in Warsaw he decides to inform on me. And you're telling me: "for the salke of rules"?!. What rules are we trying to obey? thinlk about it. Where are we? What's happening to us? Is it What we were studying the medicine for? - No, it's just the way Poland is. - Do not deride! When you get sacked you'll marlk my words. thinlk about it, can't you see that everything's deteriorating?!. It's just sand but we were supposed to follow the ideals. - What is deteriorating? - Everything is deteriorating! the world is deteriorating. It's already deteriorated. You can't live in it. [Sound of a departing airplane] thanlk you. How did you know I was coming today? We have excellent intelligence in ltaly, the world just doesn't recognize it. You are fantastic. It's not true. I did not know you were coming. I just came to pick up a colleague. But you see, there are no accidents. I was thinlking a lot about you. I toolk a liberty to order the clhurclh service for your Helena on Sunday. I thouglht you'd be back then. thanlk you for the service and your optimism. I wasn't so sure I'd be back. If you're in hurry I would be happy to give you a lift or did you call for your car? thanlk you. I will talke a cab, I want to talke my people by surprise. [Door closes] Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Welcome! What a surprise. Please, once again, receive my words of gratitude. Excuse me. What are you doing in my office? - I am deputizing for you. - You slhould be doing that at your own deslk. I'm sorry, but knowing you for a year... [nervously lauglhing]... I haven't noticed you to be so envious about external signs of power. Are you claiming that you know me well? - I thinlk so. - As a result you started to thinlk I'm crazy, didn't you? - I would never thinlk of anything similar. - You did not. You wrote it. Mr Ambassador, it's unbelievable! Who told you suclh rubbislh? - Are you going to lie for the Whole eternity? - I can swear I had never said anything lilke that. What do you swear to? Do you have any sanctities left you can swear to? Excuse me, I refuse to tolerate that. I am not going to let anyone tallk to me with suclh a tone. Mr Counsellor! Leszczynslki! No, that's so un-heard-of! I've been worlking in diplomacy for 30 years but it's the first time suclh thing happens to me. that's riglht. You used to cooperate with the informers but now you are one. Keeping that in mind, please do not get sentimental with your biograplhy. Sit down. Tell me What has been happening througlhout the last days. How's the contract for the helicopters sale? Initialled. We've had a delegation from Mount. that's riglht... but that was before my departure. - What about the building? - the owner's advocate told us that if we don't accept him... ...raising the rent four times, we would have to leave the building. - What? Is he crazy? Four times?!. When the inflation is only 300%? I hope you told him we could move out? Yes but we will have to bring the building to the state before the renovation. - Meaning we'd have to demolislh the secretariat and the penthouse. - that's but an absurd! But he's the one Who's going to waste the money! Besides he gave us a written consent for the build-up. It wasn't a written consent. I couldn't find it. How come you couldn't find it? When was the consent given? - Riglht before you were elected. - You have already been worlking here then. Meaning it is you Who is going to be responsible for finding that consent for me. If it does not get found then you will have to pay for the demolition. No! I'm sorry, Mr. Ambassador but we can't collaborate lilke that any longer. We can't. But we have to. And it's nothing but a sad necessity. - You know What? - Yes? If it was up to me I would not worlk with you at all. thanlk you for your honesty. [Loudly closed door] [Barlking] [Silent dog squealing] Is it only me or did somebody rummage througlh my wardrobe? As far as I recall, Helen left this dress in the bathroom? - [With strong ltalian accent] Maybe my wife... - I aslked you not to touclh anything. Riglht? "Leave everything... ...as Mrs Helena left it" But slhe always told us to put everything back into the wardrobe. Whatever. Slhe's gone now. Yes, slhe is. You're free to go. [Siglhs] [Plays the piano] [Closes the piano] [Plhone calling] [Plhone calling] [Plhone calling] [Couglhs] [Plhone calling] [Plhone calling] [Plhone calling] [Phone stops calling] [Speaking Spanish] Polish Embassy, may I help you? Sir! Sir! Please, sir! It's the Prime Minister! Prime Minister! Phone. [Mumbles] [lndistinctly] What do you want? [lndistinctly] What do you want? [lndistinctly] Regarding? [Shouts indistinctly in Russian] Buzz off, dog! - What? - Signature. [Birds chirping] [With ltalian accent] Did you call me? What? Yes, yes. Please call Mr. Counsellor. Do you remember about me? - It's that man sitting there again. What is he doing here? - He says he lost his passport. - So he lost it, and? - Really? I thinlk he sold it. I can sense it. Somewhat. But if Mr. Ambassador gives me an order... ...to provide him with a blanlket passport then I slhall do it riglht away. No, I won't. Riglht now it is you Who is responsible for consular matters. Fortunately, new consul is coming soon. Really? How can you tell that they're going to send us a consul soon? What? Prime Minister was supposed to tell you... ...that he was coming in no-time. - Didn't he call you? - Who? Prime Minister? I can't remember but even if he did... ...then how do you know What he was going to tell me? As far as I know, none affairs in the Ministry are lkept secret? Still, I'd lilke to see the list of all calls from the Embassy... I have this feeling that you often call the headquarters. This time it was headquarters that called. - And? - Regarding the Prime Minister's visit. I've already told you that it's not going to talke place. - He called it off. - Yes, I remember that. But it turns out that it's quite the contrary. He's coming for a one-day visit. Didn't he call you to tell you that? Yes. What about the building? Did you find the consent for the expansion? I'm still loolking for it. Do something about that applicant. I used to stand long enouglh in the queues to understand... ...Ihow he must be feeling riglht now. [Lauglhing] Must be all those departments and corridors... But! You probably don't know What I am tallking about. I do. I do, I had to wait in the queues as well. Everybody had to. You know What? Regarding him waiting there... ...I thinlk it's going to be good for him to sit there for some time. You know? If he sits for a long time... ...then he's going to concede. the moment he concedes... ...it's going to clear out Whether lhe's suclh an innocent person or he's just... ...pretending to be one, lilke a cunning gull Who... ...just simulates he loses everything. You know... ...people don't come here without any business. And that business is always slhady. [Silently] Oh! That was, comrade... ...a correct class expression. - [Lauglhing] - "Business is always slhady." [Counsellor] Oh God, God. [Quarrelling] - Give me a few pennies, please. - Get out or I'm calling the police. [Door slamming] - Who was that? - A beggar. - What did you do? - I told him to leave. Why? You slhould have given him something. - So that he squanders it on drinlk? - Is there something wrong in it? Maybe he needs to? Mrs Helena always gave something to the poor. - But he's going to buy alcolhol for it. - So What? Go catclh him. Tell him to wait. Talke all the bottles that still have something left in them. [Lauglhing] So that they don't tempt me. - You're going to give them to him. - All of them? Except this one. Talke them, talke them. And don't brealk them on your way. - Slhall I leave this one? - Yes, it's Ferne. I never drinlk it. [Puts the bottle back] viva Polonia! viva Polonia! viva Polonia! Mr Ambassador. My request may seem to be quite strange for you... ...but I would lilke you to keep Helena's aslhes. Is it your or Helena's request? Slhe loved this country, slhe told me that after her confession. Slhe felt something bad would lhappen soon. Do you still have to keep the confession secret after her death? Confession is kept secret forever. I'm not tallking about burying lher in Uruguay. I'd only lilke to store the urn in the clhurclh... ...until I return to the country. When do you intend to return? I don't know yet. We don't have a proper place to store the urn in the clhurclh. I don't see anything inappropriate in storing her in your own house. I don't know. People are not accustomed to corpse cremation but Helena always wanted it. Her father died in Auschwitz. He was burnt as well. Why did slhe confess? Just because, there's no purpose in aslking the question: Why? Now. Slhe left, being reconciled to God. Slhe came to me a few days before departure. [Female lauglhter] [Silent discussion] [Barlking, door closing] [Ambassador lauglhter, barlking] I am really not sure if we slhould have accepted your hospitality. We could have talken a room for the couriers. And now we're only going to disturb you. Well, till one day. Sooner or later, we'll find some sort of an accommodation for you. I bet you are going to have your clhildren move in here. [Lauglhing] But for this very moment... ...all you are expected to do is to help me cope with the overWhelming loneliness. During all the official occasions... ...Olksana is going to be the hostess. - Doesn't counsellor have a wife? - He does. But I like neither of them. Yealh. [Lauglhter] But I do lilke you. I don't know how I can express my gratitude to you. What for? For hosting you in an empty guest room? - It's but a trifle. - You know it's not about it. - Is it? So What is it about then? - About drawing us here. We wouldn't have come without your help. - Why is that so? - You know it very well. I'm not a part of the system. I don't know all the people I should. Why don't you? Didn't you try to meet them? You could have at least tried. But what can I do? What can I do? I'm from the provinces. Besides I didn't study... ...Where I slhould have. - What did you mean by saying: "Where I slhould have"? - Why do you aslk so many questions? You know it very well. I studied in Moscow at the time one slhould not have. And I found my wife there and one slhould not have done that as well. Well. there've been times one slhould've. Many of our diplomats returned from there with wives, Who have later on... ...worlked for the good of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Fortunately, it's no concern of ours. Anyway... It's great that... - It's great that people lilke you still exist. - Why great? Because... because, thanlks to you, justice can sometimes win. You don't understand anything. It's not the justice that wins. It's only my victory that I still have some influences left. But it slhouldn't be this way. - You have influences thanlks to What you have done in the past. - For the deserts in a lost case. Lost case? Why do you call it lost? Because there's not muclh that has clhanged. Because you get a promotion not because you're good in What you do... ...but because I helped you. But still... you helped me because I'm good. [Ambassador's lauglhter] that's riglht. I believe in that. - I would lilke to believe in that as well. - there's still something, thouglh. In my private opinion there slhould be some sort of a meclhanism. But there's none. - Why is it missing? - Because we haven't built it. [Woman spealks with Russian accent] But it's everyWhere that way. I heard that even in France, or in ltaly... ...everything is about the connections. It's all that black-White Eastern thinlking of yours... ...When, truth be told, everything is actually a matter of your position in the society. Evil is everyWhere. Sometimes there's just more of it, sometimes less. Helena always used to pray for... Do you feel your wife's existence, having your wife's aslhes close to you, here in your house? Are you afraid of Helena haunting the building? [Lauglhter] I didn't think of that. If Helena suddenly emerged here... [dog squealing] ...we wouldn't be scared of her, would we, Hipolit? Hipolit! [Waves humming] [Whistling at the dog] [Barlking] [Clasping] [Barlking] [Barlking] [Birds chirping] We will have to put a wooden partition-wall lhere. Lilke the one that used to stay here... ...do you remember it? - [Counsellor] Yes. Tell those gentlemen to do it as fast as they can. Olh, Mr Ambassador! [Couglhs] I tallked with Warsaw today. Of course, it was them Who called. So, Mr Ambassador, regarding the consul family accommodation. So, things are not too well. Because Prime Minister is going to stay in a hotel, of course... ...but two proprietary affairs inspectors are coming with him. - Finally. - And they'd rather stay in the residence. Besides, these are guest rooms we have in our Embassy. Why don't they stay in a hotel? We could accommodate consul and his wife in the hotel. Yes but Why? Because those inspectors would want us to do so? I guess so but, personally, I wouldn't do that. Here you go. Besides, I guess I know Why you wouldn't do that. Provided they stayed here... ...I would have enouglh time to set them against you. But if they stay in the hotel then you will... ...be able to tallk them into Whatever you want to. - But I don't want to tallk them into anything. - Olh, really? Seriously, you do want to. You are going to lhave to pay for the demolition after all, aren't you? [Counsellor siglhs] I called the former Ambassador yesterday and he told me that there was no written consent... ...only spolken one for the building expansion. Is former Ambassador willing to write the confirmation? that's great. You're going to divide the costs in two. You didn't thinlk that we were going to call tax-payers to account, did you? It is your liglht-lheartedness Republic of Poland is going to suffer costs for... ...so there's no other way but paying for it. - It is not up to Mr Ambassador's will to decide about it. Of course, it is the Court that is going to decide about the case. It's higlh-time we brouglht actions against suclh cases. - [Counsellor] I have a lot of worlk to do. - What do you thinlk about our new consul? Is he going to be of any good? His wife seems to be slowly installing here. Well, I only hope it's an official nomination and that... ...Mrs Olksana has already been granted Polislh citizenslhip and that slhe gave up the Russian one? I suppose. You know What? It surprises me that after so many years of service for People's Republic of Poland... ...I can hear that anti Russian note in your voice. - [Counsellor's lauglhter] - Well, but since you're that interested, you can clheck it... ...by yourself by calling to the headquarters. - But it is you Who is responsible for the institution safety. Tallking about that new consul, he's got worlk. they found a corpse of that guy you aslked me to provide with a blanlket passport. the passport was returned and the case is investigated. See, if we had not given him that passport, lhe miglht have been still alive... ...at least for a few days. - Yealh. A coffin will have to be sealed. We've been sent money to cover the costs for sending back the corpse. Turns out he was not as poor as he pretended to be... ...thouglh he loolked so bad that no one would ever give him a brolken penny. I hope you'll go there with our new consul, as it's quite a difficult assignment for the beginning. there are no easy assignments here. I've got some worlk to do. Unless Mr Ambassador gives me an order. A written one? No way. - I'll go there by myself. - thanlk you very muclh. Unfortunately everything, pockets, even the slhoes. - Do you have the gloves? - Yes. You can't do it with bare hands. - Can you see the seals? - Yes, everything is Where it slhould be. Fine. You can open up the cover. You know What? Forgive me but l... I'll leave you here on your own. You understand. [Speaks ltalian] Excuse me for a moment. [Door knocking] One moment. - Yes? - Have you been doing something to my wardrobe recently? Me? Not at all! I never enter this room on my own. Maybe it was counsellor at the time he used to worlk here? Yes, it's possible. It could have been counsellor. I don't know if I slhould be telling you that, being a local here... ...but this time Mr Counsellor must have done something. those documents regarding the expansion used to be here. I was the one who even translated them. After doing so I hid them in the briefcase. I can remember that. - Mr Counsellor would cut his own throat? - No. [lauglhter] Counsellor and the house-owner are... ...amigos. - Mlhm. So provided the house-owner receives his compensation... ...Ihe miglht want to get equal with our counsellor. Suclh frauds often happen here. [Siglhs] Olh my God. Human imagination knows no boundaries. - I thinlk I'm never going to malke money. thanlk you very muclh. - No problem. It wasn't a problem for you, but I seem to be too dumb to even sense it. [Lauglhs] [Woman screaming] [Woman screaming] [Silent knocking on the door] So... You're already here, so talke a loolk if any of these dresses fits on you. - No, I can't. - What do you mean? Go, clhoose one. I'd lilke to see you in her clothes. But I can't. Go on, don't hesitate. [Ambassador lauglhs with satisfaction] Helena was taller than you but we could have the clothes altered if necessary. We'll send the rest of the clothes to the Red Cross. Olh. this one has just been returned from the laundry. there's a service for Helen today... ...so you could put on that dress. ...to the clhurclh, thouglh I don't even lknow if you're planning to go. thanlk you for everything, for your kind memory and friendslhip. Since Luciana is being clharmed by those gentlemen, may I tallk to you for a moment? I have a problem with the internal security at the Embassy. I could call headquarters and they'd send me someone. If they will find nothing I will come out stupid. - Mr Ambassador? - One moment. - He's your new driver? - No, he's a consul. - So What do you thinlk? - I don't know. Do you want me to tallk to our security? Not really, you are so competitive. Do you thinlk we compete with you to that helicopter contract? Better loolk out for the Russian, they're stealing the deal. Mr Waldek. We've got to do something about that tie of yours. - But it's a new tie. - [Lauglhing] So give it to the driver. the suit needs fixing too. - You are needed at the Embassy, there's a message for you. - Why didn't they call me on my mobile? You were outside the networlk coverage. When did it come? An hour ago. I called Rodrigo as fast as I could... ...after the counsellor had given the paper to me. It was not even a restricted delivery. [Siglhs] Put me througlh to the headquarters at this instance. Directly to the Prime Minister. I mean, vice-! Si, si. the matter in the dispute is Whether national identity and social colhesion... ...can be defended only by increasing the efforts. No way. - Only by increasing the efforts towards... - Wait a second. Put him througlh. ...transplanting the earlier standards... - Excuse me. [Plhone calling] Mr Ambassador? I'm listening. Listen, What's going on? Don't mess around, Why do you use suclh a tone towards me in your writings? And just What tone are you using riglht now When tallking to me? What do you mean? I'll put it slhort: I don't lilke When people treat me lilke a dog. And I'm not going to let anyone treat me that way. - Who treated you this way? - You did. Just lilke a dog. You used exactly that word. - I can't recall anything. - It's difficult to tallk to someone with amnesia. Listen, I thinlk that one of us is probably crazy. Could be. And I'm not tallking about myself. that was very polite. Tell me What you meant in that dispatclh you sent me. I meant that your protege consul... ...Iet througlh three kilos of cocaine in the coffin. In a moment or two the worldwide press is going to find out about it. You'd better clheck if it's only lhis stupidity and naivety. - I can guarantee you... - Find out and stop boring me. Listen. the only reason I'm tallking to you is that Russian vice Minister... ...is said to be already in Montevideo. He can ruin our business as we have better offer for the helicopters. You are his friend. Find out... ...if there is a way to block him. Are you sure he's already there? I thinlk he would have called me in suclh a case. - I have to go. - Hang on, just a moment. I can't. We'll meet in a few days anyway. Call Mr Counsellor, please. What is it? What's that? Do we have a burglary? It's ventilation. Tell Rodrigo to put in a new pane. Is consul at the Embassy? - He left for some sort of an inlheritance case. - Does he know about the message we were sent? No, I wanted to wait with that for Mr Ambassador. I was riglht about that guy, wasn't l? - He was plhoney. - You would be riglht if you could smell his stenclh in the coffin. Do you thinlk he had something to do with that smuggling? Police started the investigation... Whiclh means so. - And he seemed to be suclh a nice guy. - You slhould never trust suclh people. You seem to be so sure but tell me: Who do you seem to be? I guess you loolk just lilke a nice person. Mr Ambassador, it was not a nice joke. Don't expect me to be telling you nice jolkes. Aslk Olksana to come here. Waldemar already knows. How come? He knew about everything and he still decided to go? What a fool! He was afraid to loolk into your eyes. Olh. And he decided to use you as a slhield. What a kniglht. Now you can see in What condition Polislh civil courage is. Fine. Call your Embassy riglht away. My Embassy? this one here is mine. - And? - they said their Minister was in private and... ...Ihad gone to some sort of a centre. Everything's wrong again. I've really had enouglh of this. Buy me an airline ticket... ...to that airport - What was its name... It was... ...you know, from the other side... You can remember. - Yes, I do. Return... the day after tomorrow, evening. the day after tomorrow? You remember about the delegation coming, riglht? What do you thinlk? that I'm unconscious? What are you telling me all of this for? I want an airplane that would let me come here before their arrival. - What about my husband? - Tell him I'm going to slhoot him on siglht. I put it here. I remember that after I had came back from the Embassy... ...I prepared everything that would be necessary. I couldn't have gone crazy. It was somewhere over here. Was anyone here When I was talking a nap? Maybe your wife? - No, no. - Riglht, "no, no". that's impossible. It was here and now it's gone. The devil must have put it under his tail. - Mrs Olksana, has slhe been here? - Yes but I thinlk that not in this room. Slhe wanted to talke some clothes for the consul. What a dimwit. He must be really afraid of meeting me. Maybe slhe has been in here? Slhe miglht have had a business in me not leaving the country. - that's the last plane. - We're going to malke it. I have to buy a new ticket, thouglh. We have a reservation for you. For one niglht. Is this gentleman staying here? His man sounds foreign so here's his card. they're spending the day on the yaclht but they will be back for the niglht. - What country are you from? - You guess. Slovalkian, not Czeclh, I thinlk. Ulkrainian, Bulgarian or Polislh. You're riglht, Polislh. Be it ten years ago, I would have probably been still rotting someWhere at the province... ...in Poland. Now it's different. thanlks to Whom can you be leaving the country now? Who clhanged that? Solidarnosc, the Pope. Could be Reagan with that Russian guy... Gorbaczov. All riglht, sit down. Here you go. Tell me... Can you do Whatever you want to? I can see that you carry the luggage here... But What's going to be next? Are you planning to return to the country? We slhall see... When I have enouglh money... ...I intend to come back to Poland and launclh some sort of a niglht club. We don't have many of those at the provinces. And you thinlk that our fellow-citizens miss niglht clubs? [Ambassador's lauglhter] Do you know how to run one? Why not? I know two Polislh girls here, they worlk in a niglht club and... ...they someWhat got me into the business. So I often talke a closer peelk at the gears... ...I learn a lot of things, earn some money. What do you do? It's nothing worth mentioning but it's fine. they pay me. - Are the Polislh girls satisfied? - Not really. the pimps toolk all of their passports and they can't move anyWhere. they talke all their belongings, actually. I could help them with those passports. Seriously?...they don't have the money thouglh and... maybe we could talke it on credit? [Silent Ambassador's lauglhter] - I work at the Embassy. - Really? Not only are you a Pole but also from the Embassy. I'm going to tell the girls that you could help them. [Car slowing down] [lndistinct club music] [Whistling] [Loud lauglhter] Are you really a consul? Aren't you joking? No, but I can help you with obtaining permission for departure. We're all from Poland and there's one Ulkrainian with us. - So What's the problem? You've got passports? - they toolk them. We don't have money for the tickets. You will receive... ...money for the tickets at the consulate. - What about me? the situation is more complex with you... I'll try to do something about you. Anyway, I'm leaving tomorrow... ...to Montevideo. If any of you wants to leave now then it's not a problem. the motorboat will be waiting at the hotel Argentino at 4 o' clock. I'll pay the Montevideo flight costs for you. [Loud music, Whistling] [People shouting admiringly] Witja, Witja, Witja! Is Polislh Ambassador relaxing here instead of preparing for a conference? Its participants are relaxing as well. My old friend, Mr. Leszczynslki. Wilktor, Polislh Ambassador in Uruguay. Sit down. So What? Will you have time to tallk with me? Of course, that's the sole purpose I came here. You know What I thinlk about the congresses. they're planning something for me for the last day, but the rest of my time is for you. What about today? Today... Do you still play tennis? I'm too old for that. He's the first person in Poland Who played tennis using both hands. What a cross he had! Come to support me today, I'm playing a matclh. With Whom? You know that ltalian Ambassador's wife, it's someone from her companionslhip. No. I'm done with that. the Russian Minister tells me that he lost every tennis game with you in Warsaw. We were both 20 years younger. And, please. Sit down. And I used to slhow off a lot. - Did Helena clheer you? - this was before we got married. Helena was always on the loolk-out. I remember. Helena told me about a Russian guy, it must have been Oleg. What did slhe say? I remember her say... Slhe was completely sure he'll never malke a career. But he did. Slhe thouglht he was a misfit? No, slhe said he was more interested in women than in politics. Women... He was interested in one woman, in Helena. And politics. He clheered our underground. When was that? When you were free and busy malking a fortune. We were figlhting for freedom and we didn't know... ...What money was about. I lost so I have to buy him a drinlk. Are you staying here for long? I have an airplane in one and half an hour. So we are going to meet in Montevideo? Now don't tell me you came here only for me. No, I had some consular business to do here. I hoped I would spend a couple of hours with you though. Witja. Don't be angry at me, we'll meet in Montevideo. Forgive me. Listen. Here's $100. If any of those girls wanted to escape... ...then help her. - Fine. What do you thinlk? Why none of them came? Were they afraid? - Did he scare them or What? - I thinlk that they were lying about... ...being put pressure onto and they simply wanted to stay here. - [Lauglhter] Just lilke you. - No. Nobody puts pressure on me. I thinlk l... I lilke What I am doing and they even pay me for it. [Motorboat engine turns off] What happened? I am going to be late for the airplane! We'll try to do something about it. Mr Amb... Mr Ambassador. - I wanted to explain myself. - Has Minister gone? Yes, counsellor toolk him to the hotel. - Mr Minister aslked you to... - I know, I know, I know! - Are you by car? - No. - Let's catch a taxi. - To the residence? No, to the hotel. [lndistinct music] Mr Minister, Mr Ambassador. Why are you belhaving in suclh a foolislh way? I couldn't be waiting for you because my airplane was late and you forbid all incoming connections to your room at the reception? I only aslked them not to put througlh connections from Warsaw. You thouglht it was because of you? [Lauglhter] I wouldn't even thinlk of it. [Lauglhter coming from the inside of the room] How's our Russian friend? He lost a tennis game with somebody from the general staff. I think it's not just an accident. What about you? What did you do? Me? Nothing. It's your level. I'm going to see him again but it's going to be already after everything. I'm going to be here for only one day! You expect me to do things that are impossible! How am I supposed to unscrew things that you slhould lhave been worlking on for months? So let us tell you that we have actually been worlking on them! We've already got the initials but there's no signature. What if they don't sign it? Polislh press has already applauded the Whole thing. I don't know. You cannot rely on anybody nowadays. Wait a moment. What are you trying to say? that you cannot rely on me? If you didn't malke it to the airport, then yes. What could those guys be thinlking of me now? Mr Ambassador didn't trouble himself to come to the airport? Still, I can see that your employees malke up this dislhonour in a very courageous manner. Let me tell you something. We're both in a political service. Our usual undue familiarity doesn't matter any more. Worlk is worlk, my dear. I'll be waiting for you tomorrow. [Loudly closed door] Find me somebody Who is responsible for the orders. How am I supposed to do that? [Siglhs] Maybe we slhould see one of them at the brealk? - Maybe... this is not a way to settle anything! - Of course it's not. that's Why you're going to arrange a meeting for us at the Embassy or at the hotel. Up to you. Listen. No one does it this way, it's inappropriate. You cannot malke an appointment for the same day without any warning! What you demand from me is absolutely unprofessional. Don't teaclh me What is and What is not professional, Wilktor. Just do What I aslked you to do, all riglht? I can't do it by myself. I'll call Luciana, he'll set up a meeting riglht away. [A speech is being given, phone calling] Olkay. - You're going to buy a huge bouquet... - Alha. ...and talke it to that ltalian Ambassador's residence, having attaclhed my card to it first. Riglht away. And you're to be back here as soon as possible. Do you have the money? All riglht, the money will be waiting for you at the Embassy. Go. Waldemar? Listen, Rodrigo's going to be at the Embassy soon. Give him the money. From the caslhbox. Malke out a bill and sign it with my name. What girl? All riglht. Put her discreetly in the car... ...and come here at the lunclh brealk. Great. thank you for setting up the meeting but it's not needed any more. Call it off or meet him on your own. I talked to the Defence Minister himself. Seems that nothing has clhanged and that they are going to sign the contract. that's great but What will he thinlk of me? You can't belhave lilke that! Tallk to him, even pro forma. I'm not going to do it because of the form. If I tallked to the superior... ...and he acknowledged everything, then I cannot meet with his subordinate now. You will meet with him. - Fine, but what am I supposed to say^?. - I don't know. thinlk of something. Offer him something. Tell him I had to leave earlier. In return you don't have to see me to the airport. For this time only, of course. Agreed. thanlk you very muclh. I'd lilke to tallk with you about one more thing before I go. It's quite a delicate issue. I have a feeling that something's wrong with the security at the Embassy. - Of course, that's just a suspicion. - I'm not the riglht person to tallk about that. You do know it has to be done througlh official clhannels, riglht? [Honlking] [Car engine starts] - You're the girl from Ulkraine. - Yes. But my mom was Polislh. And? Do you have the passport? Did they give you it back? Yes. - Ulkraine has its diplomatic post in Buenos. - And you thinlk they're going to send her a ticket here? Here's my card... ...pay for her ticket with it. - You can sign for me, can't you? - What if they aslk for my identity card? All riglht, let's do it different way. Here's my... ...PlN number. Talke the money from the caslh dispenser. I'm going to the Embassy, so I can give you a lift. [With a cracking voice] What about me? - You're going by the next airplane. - But I don't have the money, I really don't. that's Why we're going to give you the money. When you earn it you'll send it back to me. I don't know When I'll be able to do that, since me and my mother have no money... I guess never. [Snorts disapprovingly] Kiss the priest in the hand, not me. Please excuse Minister for not being able to meet you here. On his belhalf I would lilke to invite you to our country... ...and decorate you with a medal by the way. Does it satisfy you? I usually do not run away When people want to decorate me but I reckon it's a bit too early. Mr Minister wants to apologize for his absence, he had to leave earlier. He left a small gift for you as a thanlks for your kindness. So, gentlemen. What plhase are we at? What are we going to do? I thinlk... We both thinlk we need to buy the building. Not for a price the house-owner wants us to pay, I hope. We don't have any other clhoice. So you claim we can afford overpaying? Somebody is responsible for suclh a state. And we need to point him! I know that there was a consent, a written consent for this expansion... ...but somebody has lately removed it from the file binder. If we had it in our hands then there would be no problem. We would have left the building in a state in Whiclh it is riglht now... ...and we would have rented ourselves a new place. How do you know that there was a written consent? How do I know that? There are witnesses. Just one: A secretary. And slhe was in a conflict with former Ambassador. Slhe was even reprimanded upon his proposal. By the way: A reprimand came for Mr consul for that coffin. - Great. - Besides, secretary is not Polislh... ...so, you know, we cannot trust her if slhe issues a statement against Polislh citizens. Slhe issued a statement against Polislh people but, at the same time, in the interest of Republic of Poland. And that's the only thing you slhould be loolking after at the moment. Mr Ambassador. I am not going to tolerate suclh remarlks... Good bye. I would lilke to tallk to you privately. What do you mean "privately"? On the plhone? Please, please. Take a seat. I would lilke to aslk about the thing you mentioned to the Minister. You feel some sort of an unrest... ...and you are haunted by thouglht that something could be wrong with the internal security. I'm just afraid that a person from my personnel miglht have been recruited by foreign intelligence. Who do you suspect? I have an impression that you are not aslking for the names, but for the intelligence. Well, I suspect the Russian. Generally spealking... in your life... are you often filled with suspicions? Are you aslking What I fill? I fill my dog's, Hipolit's, bowl with food. - [Lauglhter] You are jolking... - Just the opposite. I just thinlk that your mission is over. No, not yet. At least I will have to stay lhere for a couple of days more. Olh. So stay. I was not aslking about you two but about your mission. If I understand it correctly, it's over. But if you want to stay at the Embassy then do not hesitate to do so. Actually... (lauglhing) I don't care. the only thing left I can do is to hang myself. Do you often have suclh thouglhts? From time to time. But I'm not going to confide to you. - Good bye. - I was just leaving. I'm not leaving because of you. It's about my dog! Everything is arranged. Tomorrow afternoon, Russian vice Minister. What about the dog? He was vomiting. He must have eaten something, lhe vomited with a black gunlk. Just in case I gave him a lot of millk, he dranlk everything and has slept since then. - Did that residence fax came? - Yes. Just a moment ago. Well, maybe half an hour ago. I put it on your desk. Slhow me Where it's lying. Here it is. - Didn't you touclh anything in here? - No, Why? Is something missing? - Why are your hands dirty? - I'm sorry. I didn't manage to waslh them. - What is it, Mrs? - I was cleaning after your dog. So now you are calling me Mrs? Olh, it was just an accident. [Siglhs] [Honlking] [Louder honlking] What are you duplicating? - Is it some sort of a publication for your underground? - No, we don't worlk underground. I'm a member of a clharity foundation, in Poland, for handicapped clhildren. I find materials for them here and send to them. they may be useful for them. You know What... I did not expect you to work for a foundation. I've always thouglht that there are people rotten to the core. It turns out I was wrong. You know What? those inspectors claim we do not care about savings at the Embassy. - How many copies do you have in here? - Twenty. So Why don't we do it on a different basis from now on? Let's order Olksana... ...to set up a journal and keep the keys... ...and if anyone wanted to duplicate anything he would lhave to write an entry to the journal with... - What do you thinlk? - Great idea. I'll start doing so. I'm leaving now. Please duplicate these papers for me before you go and put them into the file binder. Olh! And please remember to note Who duplicates What. And how many times they do it, above all. Maybe this way you will learn to save the paper. What an irony of fate. that congress was supposed to talke place earlier, exactly one month ago. I don't know Why they delayed it. What would happen if we met there altogether: Me, you and Helena? [Presses the key] We would probably be recalling the old times. We will be recalling them today as well. If Helen was here with us, our meeting would not have ended up with reminiscences. [Plays the piano] What would it have ended up with, then? Maybe we would have learnt something about us. Something, we do not know yet. About you, about us and you two. If we were here altogether... ...we would have learnt something about us that we hadn't known before? I guess so. Interesting. Listen... I still don't know something... When you were with us back then in Warsaw as a soviet diplomat, When you sympathized with the underground... ...were you really honest? I mean, did you pretend to be honest and then informed on people? Or maybe you did not pretend but still informed? Or maybe you did not inform on them at all? You had to inform on them because it was in the interest of your country. So: Can you answer me by simply saying: Yes or no? I only want to know that. I could tell you that. But I won't. You know... there is a saying in the Gospel... ..."so that your speeclh slhall simple stay". Yes means yes, no means no. And you recently said that you have started to recognize the Gospel again. How can one not recognize something that he has seen througlhout his life? I didn't know the Gospel but I discovered it by myself, later on. You? Yes, I did. Why are you so surprised? I simply can't believe that. You don't believe that I discovered the Gospel by myself? Yes. Don't you feel that What you are saying offends me? Forgive me, I cannot stop the feeling that it's not a real conversion. Just an idea for life that comes and goes. And that's What you thinlk, a catholic? You approaclh God with your brains. We, the Orthodox, try to approaclh him with everything... ...but brains. It's hard for me to believe that your words are honest. Don't tell me you drinlk that. You know What, I brouglht you a present. I ordered a print, especially for you. But after What you had told me, I'm not going to give you it. As you wislh. Up to now we figured that there's no agreement in terms of the past. What now? Do we have an agreement in terms of the present? Negative on that. Why? You're trying to steal the helicopter sale contract from us. We, from you? What are you tallking about? Yes, I have the impression that your lkind compatriot, my worlker... is helping you in these exertions. What would we need her for? We don't need any help. - Are you sure about that? - Absolutely. Firstly, we're better than you. Secondly, it is you Who steals our licences, not the other way. thirdly, your vice Minister arranges things with people... ...Who only dream of medals. We worlk at the bottom, silently, calmly and very efficiently. You simply give provisions to people. - I do? - Yes. I didn't say that. Did anyone forbid you to do so? Rules. What? Rules. - [ln Polish] Rules? - [ln Russian] Yes. Goddamn you. What a metamorplhosis. 20 years ago, When we really obeyed the rules... ...you used to call us in a disdainful way: "Stinlking Soviets". Now that everything's clhanged and, just lilke the Whole world, you have no rules... ...you suddenly start spealking of them. And because of those rules you're going to fuck up the business not only of yours, but of your country. You've got a point on that. that's not really riglht. Don't you pee, because of rules, as well? Where do you do that in here? You mean, Where's the toilet? Turn left and then riglht. thanlk you. Did you know that fislhes never sleep? that's Why I raise them. Every time I walke up, they are always watclhful. I'm afraid of sleeping. It's the death's brother. That's our real existence. Nicely said, I've read that someWhere. Excellence, you've been rummaging througlh my jacket. Just admit that. Yes, I have. Now that's funny. Every Pole, including you, suspects every Russian, including me... that he's a swindler, liar and that he informs on people... ...While he himself calmly rummages througlh the pockets of someone's jacket... ...with completely clear conscience. And all of that organically joins in one man. In you. Forgive me. You provolked me. Did you have a romance with Helena? It depends on what you consider a romance. Don't tell me, I don't want to know. You're lying, you're desperate to find it out but you're afraid. You're afraid of something that cannot be fixed and that has no further course. that's Why I am not going to tell you anything. Are you leaving tomorrow? Yes. Olh my. I didn't malke it to bid farewell to our guest. It doesn't matter. Wait here, I'm going to the Embassy. I'll be riglht back. I'd lilke to tallk with you for a moment When I return. I've had a very serious suspicion for a very long time. Now I have the evidence for the fact that you have been worlking for the intelligence of a foreign country... ...and that you were recruited. - Me? - Yes, you. How would you explain the fact that you were malking double duplications? - How many duplications did I aslk you to malke? One. - And I did. No, no, no. No. You are lying. You were malking two duplications. Instead of putting the second one to the file cabinet, you toolk it. I checked that. No, it's not lilke that. Everything's different. Mrs Oksana. I am about to call the Security Service in Warsaw... ...because I have serious suspicions that you were informing your government about our commercial secrets. Yes. And we're going to lose our helicopter sale contract thanlks to you. this means that you're going to go to jail. And your husband can forget about his political career. No! It's not like that. Were you malking double duplications? - Yes, I were. - Were you rummaging througlh the papers in my drawer? I know you were... ...as the drawers were signed. Unfortunately, I set up a trap for you. And that vomiting of my dog you mentioned and that you had to clean after him... ...was just a contrivance. No. No, no, you got it all wrong. I'll explain everything. - What is there left for explaining? - A lot. Listen to me. Waldelk brouglht me here from Moscow after he lhad finislhed his studies. We got married and he let my parents move in here. they live in his house at the countryside. they talke care of our clhildren and the lhouselhold. Our Whole life depends on him now. Yes. And you ruined his life. I didn't do anything, I was just collecting the materials. Every time he signed something for you, receipts, invoices for payments, all sorts of papers. Who knows if he's not going to find me boring after I 0 years. He's going to be at the age When men thinlk not with their heads but with What they have underneath their pants. Maybe he comes up with an idea of getting rid of us. I was collecting this in order to protect my family and have something against him. Are you planning to... use it against him? Only if he intends to harm us. Does he know about this? No way... But I know he would understand me if he found out. He studied with us so he knows how difficult life can be. I beg you, don't bring an action against me. I can do everything for you. Everything. What do you mean by saying: Everything? Don't you understand?!. I have to go to the vet. Didn't you do anything to him? No. I swear I did not. Tell me now What you are going to do with me. I don't know. I don't know, I'll thinlk about it on the way. He would live a month, two months more. It's a cancer. You're telling me he could live with this... Yes but if we put him to sleep now, lhe wouldn't be suffering anymore. the most difficult thing for a dog is awareness of the fact that he is about to die at the vet's. You brouglht him today for the examinations, lhe does not suspect anything. It's going to be better both for him and for you. All that awaits him is suffering. Is his life worth extending? Put him to sleep. [Siglhs] What evil have you done in your life, my poor friend? there's nothing left now but death. Olh, you bit the postman. You ate Helena's gloves. I guess it's nothing and that they're going to talke you without any problem in that... ...Iand of eternal hunt of yours, hulh? Hipolit? It's done... He's no longer with us. [Cries] [Sound of door, being quietly opened] I need to tallk with you. We've already called the taxi, we're about to go to the hotel. I'd lilke to thanlk you for your hosting but we no longer can live under the same roof. Tomorrow morning I'm going to submit... [clears throat] ...I'm going to submit an application for dismissal from the institution. [With a cracking voice] You're always suspecting us of something. I don't know, I thinlk you would even suspect God of the worst... the worst things. Excuse me... Excuse me. But I never... I don't get it! You were an ideal for me! I believed... ...I believed... I don't get it! Explain that to me! I... I can understand that you don't have your own life. You lost it... and now all you... all you do is draining it from us! Why do you humiliate us!? Why do you treat us lilke slhit?!. What have I done to you? What have I done to you?!. Answer me! And Olksana?!. What has slhe done to you?!. I know you know that! I know how slhe... turns you on! What, am I wrong? See, you're not even trying to defend yourself! Am I wrong?!. [Silently] I'm aslking you. I'm aslking you!! Alcolholic! Swine, pervert. [throws his luggage on the floor] And it's not only our opinion. those guys from Warsaw were sent because somebody informed on you that you suffer from mental problems. One of them is a psyclhologist. He asked us questions about you... He aslked us many times about you but we never deceived you. [Mobile phone beeper] It's the cab. Leave your hotel address. You're on duty so all formalities need to be obeyed. Olh! By the way, you were... ...suspecting Olksana of cooperating with the Russian government. A fax from Warsaw just came... ...that the helicopter contract was talken by the ltalian government. [Breathes deeply] [Moans] [Siglhs] Helena? So you did came. [Door knocking] Excellency? - Nothing's clhanged in his room. - [Rodrigo] Olkay. Bottles are untouched. The bed is made. Listen, I thinlk we slhould call the Russian... ...and aslk that Minister of theirs. He tallked with him for a long time yesterday. Maybe he could suggest something. Has he arrived? Not yet. How could he disappear? Where has he gone? People don't disappear. We're waiting for him. I'm already late for my airplane. When he returns, please give him this plhoto scrap. I'll hand it over to him. From what I have observed... ...Mr Ambassador had some problems. Emotional problems. there's always somebody on duty at the headquarters... What do you thinlk? It's higlh-time we called them... He's there! Is everything all riglht? Is everything fine? Mr. Ambassador. You really gave us a reason to feel anxious for you. Excellency, you cannot belhave lilke that! I have performed a burial ceremony. I heard... ...music of the splheres. I'll try to write it down. Do not try to disturb me. [Counsellor siglhs] [Ambassador plays the piano] [Music is continued, quieter] [Englislh subtitles: TML group]
