Mr Lin said it'd be okay. Really? Well, I'm also Mr Lin... ... and I say no. Take those boots back to the army! Hi, is that "No Line"? You left your phone behind yesterday. Let me in! Great!? You didn't oversleep. - You're the one who always oversleeps. - Ha! What are you doing? Take your shoes off. Too many sweets are bad for you! What a pig! Taking care of a pawnshop is a real drag. You're bored on your first day? You try, then you'll know. I can handle it. Treat the customers like your patients. Fill in the form, negotiate a price, check their ID... You don't negotiate in hospital. Then skip the negotiation part! - You have any other lenses?? - No. Three months ago... ... I fell off my scooter, turning right. My right palm was scarred. Some of the lines on the palm were erased. The nurse who dressed the wound said... "Congratulations! You've escaped your fate!" I didn't get it at first. Then I began to like the joke. No one wants to be constrained by fate. But no one can escape fate either. I'm luckier than most. I'm one step on the way. My right hand doesn't show my fate. You're going to be rich! Nonsense! The line's not there! Ask the doctor tonight. No... Check out my dad's hands. See how soon he'll get better. It doesn't matter if you don't believe. You want to call a taxi? No. It's quicker by subway. It's so boring... I'll bring a book tomorrow. Out of date... What? When do you finish? I'm here 23 hours a day. So when will you come to the hospital? Don't know, Ma didn't say. - I have to get to work. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Get some rest before you come here. Eiko. Yes? Ask Ma if there's anything she needs. Okay, bye. One, two... You beast! Lose again and you have to strip! Play it! One, two, three, four, five, six... All right, I quit! Strip! You have to strip! Take a look at this diamond for me. The price is down recently. I'd advise you not to pawn it. Take a look at it anyway. No market for diamonds these days... NT$12,000. Can you go a little higher? All right, I'll take 12,000. Your ID? Eiko. Give me a hand. Where's Mr Lin? My father's in hospital, Hospital? When will he be back? - I don't know. - Don't know? None of you know when he'll be back? Really? Hey, Mr Lin's in hospital. His son's in the shop. What should I do? It's Dad's business, stay out of it. Back when I was still in school... ... I once asked a client... "How come you have so many Rolexes?" Everyone stared at me. The big guy himself... But my Dad seemed stunned too. I suddenly understood there are two ways to communicate. One is formal, the other is more intuitive... Open it! Gold and jade up here, diamonds down here. Aside from the three members of my family... ... I don't think anyone else has ever seen inside. Hey, it's gone moldy... It still works! Who'd have thought it. I'd almost forgotten. This coat was pawned too? Yes. Redemption dates for all this stuff are long past. Why weren't they redeemed? This one suits me! Boring! I thought there'd be something valuable! But there's nothing! Eiko! You must drink! Come on, lovers' cup style! I have to work tonight, I can't drink now. You drink if you want to. I met her on the internet. She liked a character called "Eiko"... ... in a Japanese soap opera. So she called herself Eiko. Back then, I was using two web-names. When I was in a good mood... ... I called myself "No Limit." Implying that I felt no constraints. But when I was in a bad mood... ... I called myself "No Line." Because the lines on my palm were gone. She likes TV soaps, fashion, stuff like that. So when she saw the name "No Line"... ... she thought it meant I worked for a broadcast channel. We began chatting online. When I mentioned that a nurse told me... ... I was "escaping my fate"... ... the screen stayed blank for 18 seconds. I thought she'd logged off. Then a stream of words appeared on the monitor. "I know you! I was the one who said that!" Hello? I'm trying to contact Mr Lin. That's right... Thank you. Hello, Mr Lin? This is Lin Tung-Ching, the web designer. You emailed me. Right. Shall we fix a time to meet? Today? Today is fine. I know that place. Fine, okay... Bye. Hello, Ma? Is Dad awake? I'll come over to the hospital today. Anything I can bring? The black cotton jacket? I know the one. No... No, I have some business this afternoon. So it's okay to close the shop? All right, bye! Hello, Eiko... I'm busy this afternoon, so don't come by. If you hear this message, call me back. Okay, bye. I want to pawn this watch. What do I have to do? Let me take a look. It's a good watch. How much do you want for it? How much can I get? NT$4,000... The interest will be 400 a month. I see. There's a shop in Sanchung which offers 2,500. Then pawn them there! Their interest charges are too high That's why they give you a higher price. The extra 500 is money, right? But 2,000 is too low! They're Panasonic GD90s! Then go to the other shop! We offer only 2,000. Their interest charges are too high. I will redeem them. You tell him! A Libra! She's new here, she doesn't know the price. We offer 800 for mobiles. So that's a total of 1,600... Can I have your ID? But she just said 2,000! Did you settle on 2,000? Yes. Well, if you had a deal... But if anyone asks, tell them we give 800. Otherwise you'll make things hard for us. See what I mean? I get it. ID? You Owe me one What? "Sagittarius" "Fuck you" Please "Your expenses in the run-up to New Year..." "... may bankrupt you." "You need to be frugal." What star sign will come in next? How should I know? I think it'll be a Cancer. Nonsense! Miss, what's the current interest rate? 9.45%. Call it 10%... I'll give you 1,000 for 10,000. Okay, we'll lend you money, but what's the collateral? A watch? Your ID? That's it! His ID as collateral! I'll pay you back in 30 minute. - It doesn't work that way... - I'll definitely return it. Take all this... I'll pay you back in half an hour. No can do. Brother Nan, how about you be the collateral? No way. I like the sound of that. I'll lend you 5,000... The interest will be 1,000. And he stays here. Okay... he'll stay. - Just half an hour. - All right. Wait here for me. You gotta win. Sorry... Water... Water? - What? - Can I have a glass of water? Thanks. He's not coming to redeem you. I should have gone myself, he wasn't going to win. If he'd been the one to stay, I wouldn't have made the loan. You think he'll come back? Forget it! Leave your jacket and you can go. But it's cold! I can't help that. - Is it a Marlboro jacket? - What? - What's your friend's star sign? - What? - When was he born? - No idea. Forget it. Just leave the jacket and you can go. Eiko, we cleaned up!. My treat! What do you want to eat? Daily record! You're Mr Lin's son? Yes. Where's your father? He's in hospital. Why is he in hospital? He had a mild stroke. But he's so thin! How could he have a stroke? It runs in his side of the family. Don't worry... These problems always crop up as you get older. Look at me now, I'm in reasonable shape. But when they promote me, I'll get high blood pressure. The next promotion, I'll get cirrhosis. We all have problems when the time comes. Speak for yourself! I'm not you! Don't be so sure! You said yourself, strokes are hereditary in your family. If you don't watch out... ... you'll go the same way. Says you! Who's that over there? My girlfriend. Your girlfriend? Wish I had a girlfriend with me at work! That'd be great! Careful! Don't forget the monitors! Come on! I'm not recording! I'll be off. You have an inkpad? In the drawer. Ask clients for their palm prints. Then I'll tell their fortunes. - Whose? - The clients'! You want to kill the business? Say that the police demand them. Don't mess about, I warn you. I'm sure they'd do it if you asked. Nobody is that stupid. When people want something from you... ... they'll do as you ask. Nonsense! Who wants what from whom? When I was in fifth grade, I had to pay for a school trip. Dad told me off, for no obvious reason. "The economy's bad," he said, "Don't go!" I found out only later... ... the authorities had made a new regulation. You had to leave fingerprints when you pawned anything. As a result, our takings went down. "When people want something, they'll do as you ask." So how come our takings dropped? But what would Eiko know about this anyway? She only knows how to have fun. Hey, boss! Will you take a red dragon? A red dragon? You mean a fish? - We don't take animals. - But it's so beautiful! Beautiful? Pawnshops don't take animals. If we took it, it'd probably die. Don't worry, I've brought the tank and pump. It's a lovely fish, and I don't want much. I'll be back for it soon. We don't do this kind of thing. Pawnshops don't take animals. Come on, you can make an exception! Give me a break! It can go on that shelf. I'll redeem it in two weeks. It's a feng-shui fish, good for business. Two weeks only, and I'm not responsible if it dies. Okay, thanks! I'll go get it - Where shall I put it? - Here. Hang on... Why isn't the red dragon red? It turns red when you feed it cockroaches. It'll be good for your father's health. I've brought everything you'll need. You need my ID, right? No, just your palm print. My palm print? You don't want my ID? You want my palm print? Miss, is this right? It'll do. Can I have a tissue to wipe my hand? Will this do? If not, I can try again. It'll do. What? My palm print? Yes, that's the rule. I've never heard of such a thing. Why is this shop different from the others? Nothing I can do, just following police orders. Then I'll go somewhere else. Give me back my things. Okay, go somewhere else. I will! Your business will suffer! Other shops have no such regulation. Why is your shop the only one? Our shop is just different, that's all. Why do we have to leave a palm print? Well, the police want it. Why? I've committed no crime! And I'm pawning my own stuff. Just comply with the regulation. Comply! Comply! What's special about this shop? "Comply!" Regulations can change, just like the economy. In the end, I did join my school trip to Wulai. And when that regulation was abolished... ... our business picked up. What about this one? Well, there's a risk of divorce. Sure. Can't hold on to money. And? A womanizer! Digestion problems. He deserves them. Nobody told him to be a womanizer. Love's been within his grasp many times, but he lacks will. Such a shame! A stubborn type! Often ill! Nonsense! If someone gets sick... ... do you always tell them to keep a red dragon? "Always catches colds, needs to drive carefully" NT$8,700. Here, count it. It's correct. Hey, Mister! Drive carefully! Sure, thanks! I can tell stranger to drive carefully... But what can I say to him? I'm always telling him I'd love to know... ... what his missing palm-lines were. He just says: "Find them on the street." Last night, when I was looking after his dad... ... I had a quick look at his palm. But it doesn't help, palm lines aren't hereditary. Did you frame that certificate? My dad did. Did you assemble the computer? Was that before your accident? Yes, I had palm-lines at that time. Which software did you install? That's really something! Who taught you that? The police. When did you have anything to do with them? In the hospital. Are you sure that's a red dragon? You bet! It turns red when it eats cockroaches. Really? That's nonsense! It's you who talks nonsense. CD-ROMs are very expensive! Another failure! This drives me mad. It's me who's being driven mad. What about your own fate? If I'm not independent enough, I'll marry twice. Any chance either husband will be me? Only if you're good to me. What else has to be moved? This is so weird. So, being good to you will make me one of your husbands. The first or the second? I'll have to think about that. NT$25. Just a moment... Eiko. Go Dutch! I don't want to marry twice. Excuse me? Go Dutch! I don't want to marry twice. I'm picking up my watch. What does it look like? A silver Prada. It was worth only NT$4,000. The police have taken the watches. A watch store nearby was robbed recently. The gold and silver watches were stolen. So they've taken the watches from the pawnshops to check. They'll return them this evening. If you can come by again... ... this evening. After six. How annoying, why does it have to be me? The hospital wants me at five today. Does that mean I can pick it up at five? Six would be safer. I see. I'll be back later. Oh, just a moment... The police want you to leave a palm print. Why? Because of the watch. At the edge. Hey, turn on the scanner. Oh... "4 pm at the subway station" "5 pm" Six o'clock would be best. Bring the watch with you. You don't need to retrieve. it from the police It's on the second shelf of your safe. How old is she? Is the daily record ready? Eiko. Can you print the daily record for Officer Lee? I need to wash my face. Since they called... ... you'd better leave for the hospital early. Don't worry, I'll get there on time. What'll you do about dinner? Shouldn't you get to the hospital early? Why are you rushing me? Eiko, is the evening paper out yet? Not yet, around four or five Are you hungry? Want to get something to eat? I'm not hungry. But I am... Will you mind the shop for me? I'll grab a snack and wait for the paper to come out. How long will you be? I'm leaving at 4.15. We may as well shut the shop early then. If you don't want to eat, I'll see you off. I'll eat with you. You want to catch this one? No, I'll get the next one. Why is your nose always dripping? There's flu around, you should dress warmly. Wish I had a girlfriend with me at work! That'd be great! I'm not late, I was waiting on the platform. You made me waste a ticket. Did you bring my watch? How can I use this? Give me another one. That's all I have! What's wrong with it anyway? I don't use the subway much. What should I do with this ticket? She said I would use it. I thought maybe she'd seen me with Eiko. Maybe she'd teased me by giving me the ticket. But that wasn't it... Anyhow, she was right. I do use the ticket. Worried about your father? No. Hey, where are you going? This one is good. Excuse me, may we bother you for a moment? It will soon be New Year... ... and cash is a bit tight. We want to sell off a few things. It's all good stuff. Like this music box. It's more than 30 years old, but in good condition. See what we have. Miss, why not take a look? See? Isn't it pretty? Sir, excuse me, take a look. Just a look! It's an unusual pair of glasses. From the late Qing Dynasty. It won't cost anything to take a look! Miss, you're so pretty. Mister, you're lucky to have such a girlfriend. Look at this jewelry box. Perfect for your accessories! Nice craftsmanship... and it's pretty too! You have a good eye. It's really special. How much is it? NT$2,500. That's expensive! It's just for a child. It's such an unusual design. Can't you sell it for less? How about this one? This one is also a music box, and it's much cheaper. How about this one? NT$1,500. Compare them. This one is less attractive. Can't you give me a better price? NT$2,000. Okay. Does anyone want to make an offer? We're getting off at the next stop. Thanks, thanks. I know! I don't think this is going to work. It seems like there's no interaction. Lucky we met that woman. Or we wouldn't have sold anything today. It's like they're made of wood! How can you interact with that? I did my best. Don't blame me. There, half each. I know! Actually, you're lucky with money. But you'll run short today... Because you'll spend too much. Has someone in your family been sick? Is it your father? What? Anyone who goes to a pawnshop... ... is facing some kind of problem. You call that fortune-telling? I can do it too. Wait... How did you know my father was sick? I saw it! See you tomorrow at eight... Bye bye! Subway sale! Items not available elsewhere! For four stops only! We get off four stops from here. So don't delay! If anything interests you, take a look. Come on over, Miss Take a look. If anything appeals, take a closer look. These things are all special. They're all well made. That's a jewelry box. Have a look at these things. Come over, Madam. How much is this? NT$850. All right, NT$2,000 will do. Sorry, Miss. It's been four stops. We'll meet again. "Friendliness oils the wheels of business." You don't hear that saying much these days. We were pretty good, eh? No even split today? It is! We didn't earn much. - Thank you. - This is yours. Thanks for your help. This is for you. Thanks... Bye! Let's go eat. What's up? Let's go. I'm going even if you aren't. Tung-Ching... This is silver willow. It's for you, it'll look nice in your place. - Careful. - Thank you. Uncle, you're late this year. It's already the 27th. I thought you weren't coming! Why wouldn't I come? I've been down south. That's why I'm a couple of days late. Have you noticed? Lots of people are redeeming stuff! It's normal, New Year is coming up. At a New Year reunion dinner... ... you wouldn't want anyone to ask... "Where's your watch?" Or "Where's your bracelet?" Am I right? It's not true... People are still pawning things. New Year and the winter break are both coming up. People need cash for gifts or tuition fees. Hello! Hello, Tung-Ching! Hey, Auntie Chang! I've made you this New Year dessert. Eat it during the holidays. How's your father doing? Dad? He's much better... They'll discharge him soon. I hope he recovers fully. Thanks. Gosh, you have a pearl dragon!. It's very pretty. Looks great! Well, I must be off. I'll come back for the plate in a few days. Bye! A pearl dragon... Why don't you want to take this train? I've arranged to meet people on the next one. You brought the dice? Sure. What happens when we roll one? Don't worry... However it lands, it's a "4." You're a good crook! Hey, Know-all... I have a proper name. Stop calling me "Know-all." Do you live alone in Taipei? Yeah. Are you going home for New Year? Not unless I earn some money. And after New Year? I'll see when the time comes. Seven months after his military service... ... my brother began sending money home. NT$5,000. I swore I'd send money home before he did. And much more than him. Out of here! By the end of this month... ... I'll be half a year out of college. I thought I could send NT$6,000 this month. But now... Subway sale! Items not available elsewhere! We're only here for... ... for four stops. After four stops... That's four stops! Wait a minute, you two! Wait! Ai, same old, same old... This isn't bad... "Miss, this camera is a good buy." "Take a photo of the beautiful bride." On this side of the grille, we offer a price. On the other side, the person says "I know." You know? Sure I do! You know, I know, we all know! He's very worried. He keeps staring at his dad's things. I know he misses him. Daily record! You're Mr Lin's son? Yes. Where's your father? He's in hospital. Why is he in hospital? He had a mild stroke. But he's so thin! How could he have a stroke? It runs in his side of the family. Don't worry... These problems always crop up as you get older. Look at me now, I'm in reasonable shape. But when they promote me, I'll get high blood pressure. The next promotion, I'll get cirrhosis. We all have problems when the time comes. Is he only worried about his father? I don't think so. He probably worries about the future too. He likes to pretend he's indifferent. But if he was really like that... ... he wouldn't be sensitive about so many things. One day he blurted out "That goes for you, not me." That goes for you, not for me! If he really didn't care, he would've said... "Bullshit! That goes for you, not for me!" "I may get cirrhosis, but where's my raise?" Bullshit! That goes for you, not for me! I may get cirrhosis, but where's my raise? Don't be so sure! You said yourself, strokes are hereditary in your family. If you don't watch out... ... you'll go the same way. More likely you! Oh, just a moment... The police want you to leave a palm print. Why? Because of the watch. Aside from the guy who pawned the red dragon... ... he'd never asked anyone else for their palm print. There's a psychiatry textbook which says... ... that people can either love or hate... ... the things which they don't possess. Does that description fit him now? Eiko. Can you print the daily record for Officer Lee? I need to wash my face. May I ask you... Do new recruits have to give their palm prints? Yes, they're kept on file at HQ. So if you've got my boyfriend's palm print... ... could you get it for me? You mean him? What's his full name? Lin Tung-Ching Which "Tung" is that? The one that means "east." And which "Ching"? The one that means "clear." Mr Lin still isn't back? Why isn't he back? Dunno! Don't know? It's almost New Year. Isn't it odd that he's still not back? Hello? Boss? Mr Lin's not back yet. Okay, okay, I get it. Not many clients during New Year... just one page. Right, it's almost New Year... take care. Just before I met you, you still had palm lines. They're still around... look for them on the street. So that's what your palm looked like! Hey, you'll soon have great good fortune! What good fortune is that? The state of the economy... ... is very obvious to many people. I asked a taxi driver about this. "How do you see the economy?" He said "When things are bad..." "... the people who usually take taxis..." "... start driving taxis." So you only need to check the number of taxis on the roads... ... to know how well the economy's doing! Four stops... Time to move. I'm kind of sensitive to the state of the economy. When I was small... ... if business in the pawnshop was brisk... ... you could bet the economy was slumping. Dad always told people... ... that everyone's unlucky sometimes. But at home, when he spoke about his line of work... ... he took a different line. Seeing so many people, he could judge by appearances. He said unlucky people have a certain look. Just a moment! Never mind! Of course I was pissed off. If Eiko weren't around... ... things could have gone smoothly. This toilet is ridiculously cramped. You can hardly move in it. The pawnshop is much bigger. And the subway station? It's huge! But suddenly size doesn't seem to matter. Nothing seems right. I'm about to come into an inheritance. But what will it be? The pawnshop or the stroke? Thank you, Mr Chang. Mrs Chang, thanks! Don't worry, Mrs Lin. Call us when you get there. I used to be "No Limit." I was very happy. But Eiko's curiosity destroyed my illusions. Now I'm a man with palm lines. I have constraints. It's all come back. I never thought I'd ever come to a place like this. The word "pawnshop" haunted me for two days. On the third day, I decided to pawn my watch. It was raining that day... there was a man behind the counter. I guessed he was the sick owner's son. If anything happens, the son takes over. Never the daughter. I've always been stubborn. My family always favored boys over girls. So I never gave an inch. If they knew I was visiting a pawnshop... ... they'd be flabbergasted. An image often pops up in my mind. A line... it's the horizon. Above the line, there's a tree. Nothing special about that, we see trees all the time. But I find myself thinking about what's below the line. We don't see the root system. And the shape of the roots... ... is a virtual mirror image of the tree. Tung-Ching! Tung-Ching! Give me a hand! Help your father
