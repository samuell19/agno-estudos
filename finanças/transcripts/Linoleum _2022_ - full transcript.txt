- Hm. Oh. Ah! Come explore science as we go above... - Three, two, one, zero. - And beyond! Close your eyes. Go ahead. Most people think it's just a black abyss. But in fact, the universe appears. Look closely. Do you see it? It's faint, but it's there if you concentrate. It's probably colorful and shifting. It's evolving and growing. Do you see it? What you're seeing is entirely unique to you. It's a kind of fingerprint, your own personal universe. Now... Open your eyes. - I said, can you open your eyes for me, Cameron? Hello? Oh, my God. It was unbelievable. - Was he dead? - The ambulance guy said he had a chance. - Paramedics. - Yeah, I know what they're called. - Well, was anyone else hurt? - What did you do till they showed? - No, but-but-well, I just kind of sat there, uh, with him. I don't know. I just-it was weird. What? - It's-it's a really crazy story, Cam. It's really crazy. You don't believe me, do you? - I do. I do. It's just the part about falling from the sky, you know? You sure it didn't hit the curb and then flip over? - Well, who was he? - Yeah. Yeah, I am. They didn't tell me, but he- he looked like a younger, better-looking version of me. - Hm. I bet my twin is a hot blonde with big fake boobs. - Oh, come on. You're beautiful as is. - Cam, you do know that it sounds outlandish, though, right? - You're a man, right? - Yeah. I understand, but it- - So why is it that, like, the standard of beauty for men is, like, high heels and a dress? What is that about? I mean, it doesn't make sense to me. Like, why- - I'm just saying- - What's wrong with, like, a good pair of pants? - I feel like there's no reason you can't give a rational explanation for this. - Because, like, at school they make you either wear, like, a skirt or pants for your uniform- - This is pressure. Air pressure. Air pressure makes the wind blow and allows us to breathe. Without air pressure, nothing could fly. Now, look at this. This airplane is flying. Well, it was in rehearsal. Air moving across the wings is what scientists call lift. Now, any fluid, be it air or water, flowing around an object puts a force on that object. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow. And it is this perpendicular force that causes airplanes... - Your show's on way too late. Why do they put a kids' show on at midnight? Midnight's a decent time slot. Besides, Tony's got some Saturday morning slot opening up soon. We'll be on with the other kids' shows before you know it. - Didn't he say that last year? - You know, my dad used to always say, "There are two kinds of people in the world, Cameron, "astronomers and astronauts. Some look at the stars, others swim in them." - Okay. - Just be happy you're young. You could still be an astronaut. - Yeah, but I don't wanna be an astronaut. You do. - No, what I mean is, you still have time to do something fantastic. - What do you want me to say here, Cameron? You're calling me Cameron now? - Yeah. It's your name, isn't it? - Isn't it your bedtime? I think it's your bedtime. - Shh. Shh. Shh. What'd I miss? Come on. - You missed the fact of the day. - No! - Yes. And that- - That's my favorite part. - Now you won't- - What was it? - You missed it. The fact's gone. - Ugh. Come on. You don't get the fact. - I talked to Larry. He said the divorce papers should be... ready in a few weeks. - Are we sure we want to do this? - We have to figure out how we're gonna tell everyone. - Forgot to brush my teeth. - Hey, come on! It's 7:15. - Whoa. - What? - It's that guy. That-that guy from the car crash that I saved or whatever, He won a Copley. He's an astronaut. - What's a Coupler? - Copley. - It's British. - It's a medal, for science, like the Nobel prize. - Well, except the Nobel is Swedish. - Remember Bill Lang? He won a Copley only four years after graduating? - God, who could forget Willie Lang? - Exactly. Ugh. - Hang on. Didn't you win a medal once? - That was a Crawford. - His father won the Copley. - Okay, now I'm lost. Actually, I don't care, so... - All right. I'm off. - God, this guy looks like me. He totally does. - I-I mean, like a little, not that much, right? - No, he does. Okay. See you, Cam. Does-does he look like me? Not a lot though, right? - Statistically speaking, in a room with over 23 people, there is more than a 50% chance that two people will have the same birthday. We've got 22 in here now, but I think we've got a pretty good shot. So let's hear some birthdays, starting in the back. Mr. Cohen. - September 8th. - August 9th. - November 7th. - March 28th. - December 10th. - November 7th. - April 4th. - February 14th. Valentine's Day. - October 31st, Halloween. - Ooh, October 31st. Spooky. Yes? - Hi. Yeah. I just got registered, and they said to come here. - Oh. Welcome, welcome. And what is your birthday, good sir? - October 31st. - We have a match, ladies and gentlemen. Mm! Isn't math cool? A Halloween destiny has been foretold. Why don't you come on in, have a seat right in front of your match. Now, probability statistics... - There is a certain force of attraction in our universe pulling us together. You, me, and the TV you're watching are all pulling on each other. This... Is gravity. The more mass an object has on Earth, the greater pull it has from Earth. We call this pull weight. With all that weight pulling down, it's a wonder anything or anyone has ever made it off planet Earth and into outer space. You gotta go 600,000 feet up to get there. That's 20 times higher than Mount Everest. So how do you get there? Rockets. - That'll work. It's a go for broadcast, Cam. - You didn't watch the whole thing. - Ooh, I trust you didn't slip any subliminal messages in there. Your shows are all the same anyway, right? - Um... - Everything okay? - Yeah. - Man, sorry about the Saturday slot. - The-the what? - The Saturday morning slot. I thought you guys really deserved it. - I've got the footage- - Mm-hmm. - And we're seeing a few problems with it... - Uh, thanks. - Yeah. - I tried to organize it, but... Tony, did you give the Saturday morning slot to another show? - Cam, Cammy, come on in. - Shonda said that-whoa. - Kent Armstrong. - But-I can't believe you're even standing right now. - Excuse me? - The crash. You crashed your car yesterday. - I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about. - I saw-I was- - No, no, no. Kent just moved to town. You know him? He's a famous-uh, uh- wow, I'm sorry, it's just... you two look a lot alike. You know that? - Not really. - Relax, buddy. It's a compliment. - But-but I don't think we do, not-not that much. Can I talk to you, Tony, for-in private? - Be my guest. Nice to meet you, uh, Samuel. - See you in a second. - What the hell is this? You promised me that Saturday slot for, like, two years now. - Okay. Cameron, take a seat. Look. I got some good news. PBS called. They are interested in "Above and Beyond." Network. Scott from the Columbus affiliate, he sent them a VHS. They loved it. - Wh-really? - "Above and Beyond" is gonna take off. I'm talking about lunch boxes, key chains, doodads, widgets, the whole thing. And you are gonna be an amazing creative consultant. - What does that mean? - They want a different host. They want Kent. He won a Copley. Did you know that? - Did you? - I did. I did. - That guy? You're joking, right? I mean, I- he's, like-he's-he's, like- he's like, my antithesis or something. - Like your nemesis? - No. - Your nemesis. - No - Cameron. - Antithesis. - You're still gonna get paid. - He- - Technically, WKFH still owns 51%. I'm sorry. The decision is final. - Well, I-I don't even know what to say. - Well, the other option, you walk right now. I mean, hell, Cam, maybe this is good for you. You go do what you're destined for. You're always talking about NASA. Send them an application. - It's not that simple. - All right. Well, I got a meeting, so... - Go around. What? Jesus. - We're gonna need two more dispatched. - Copy that. - Of course. - Sir, I need you to stand back. - This is my house. - I'm sorry. - Cameron. - Where have you been? - What is this? - You are not gonna believe what happened. - No, some old-ass Russian rocket fell from outer space, and it crashed in our backyard. - What? - How are you? - Right. Right. I work at the Air and Space Museum, so if I could see it, I might actually be able to help with the identification. - Nobody's allowed back there. - Do you understand how rare it is that a piece of this thing would fall... - You're the homeowner? Mr. Edwin? - Yeah. - Well, I'd say it'd be a while before we see any progress. No one knows who should claim it or why it even fell in the first place. There's a lot of paperwork to do in this kind of situation. - Can I-can I see it? - See what? - The rocket that fell in our backyard. I'm a-I'm an astronomer. - An astronaut? - No, I'm an astronomer, but this- - Look, I'm afraid the house is SOE, a site of evidence. You can't see it and you can't move back in either. Government jurisdiction. - So- - We'll keep you posted. I can't believe- - You smell like dog shit, Cameron. - Hey. Come in, come in. - How are you doing, Lin? - Hi, Cameron. - Hi. - You know, in Hawaii, they would call this "'ohana," which translates to "the connection of all things." Some milk? - Thanks, Lin. - Cam, I can tell you're not taking this very well. You don't look so good. You should see a doctor, or maybe a therapist. - Thanks, Lin. - Thanks for letting us stay a while. - Course. Course. I mean, you couldn't stay at that house. - They wouldn't let us. Okay. - They're calling it "Sputnik in suburbia." In a one-in-a-million event, a defunct Russian ICBM rocket crashed into the suburban neighborhood of Fairview Heights just outside of Dayton, Ohio, today. Neighbors in this sleepy cul-de-sac tell us they heard a large crash around 7:00 p.m. this evening, most thinking it was just some kind of car accident, and were shocked to hear the truth. Local police had no comment, but the FAA is investigating its origins. - So come explore science as we go above- - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, you just moved here, right? - Yeah. Yeah, my dad works for the military, so we moved from Orlando via Houston via... list goes on. We probably won't be here that long, honestly, so... - Oh, okay. Uh, do you live this way? I mean, for now, at least. - Yeah. - Cool. - I mean, we've been staying at a hotel until- well, today's the day we move into our new place, so- - Oh, God, we just moved too. - Oh. - See, a Russian rocket crashed into our backyard, so we had to evacuate. - That was you? - Yeah. Welcome to Fairview Heights, the place where space junk falls from the sky and you have to move in with your weird beach-loving aunt. Every single towel in her house is a beach towel. Strange. Uh, hey, um... Sorry, I just wanna be clear here. I'm not, like, flirting with you or anything. - No problem. - Like, you seem interesting. I just, um... You're just-like, you're not my type, you know? - Oh. Uh, hey, I got to run, actually. Um... I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. - Cool. - Cool. - Hi. - Hey. - So I heard a rocket crashed in your backyard. - Yeah. - Can I see it? - They... Sure. Come on. - This isn't Russian. I think it's American. - Oh, yeah. I think you're right. - Is it Gemini, maybe? The service module? - Service module, yeah, but... Apollo 10, I'd guess. Can't be sure. - Uh, sorry, do you know her? - Huh. Do I know you? I guess not. I don't know who she is. - Wait a minute. I recognize you. You were the-you were the host of the TV show my dad just took over. - Yeah. - I'm sorry about that. - No one ever watched it anyway. God, this is not how I thought things would turn out. I wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to do something...fantastic. - Hm. Well, I mean, you've got this pile of rocket crap right here. Why don't you just build your own rocket? It's not that simple. - Eh, it might be. Who knows? Well, thanks for showing me. - Yeah. Yeah. Visitor. - Cameron, hi. Doc has me on a steady regimen of crafts. - Oh. - Yeah. You know what that is? Yeah? - Uh... - Moebius strip. See, it only has one side. A mathematical paradox. - Wow. - Yeah. - You know, I know what a Mobius strip is. Makes you think, right? - It sure does. - Yeah. - Hey, so the craziest thing happened yesterday. - You know what that is? - Uh... What is it? Tell me. - A- a Moebius-Moebius strip. - Oh, it is? - Yeah. - What is-how many- how many sides does it have? Do you think this is just chance, all this happening right now? The-the show with the rocket crash. My...I don't know, doppelganger. It's all pretty weird, right? - What else would it be? I don't know. Um... Some kind of like, uh... Like a- - Look. You're a scientist, and that is a chair that you're sitting in, and that's a stapler, and this is a nursing home. And I am a physician for the elderly, not a therapist, not a- a psychic. I don't know what these things mean. Sometimes, they just happen. - What are you trying to say? - I'm not telling you to be rational. - Okay. So I should be irrational. - No. Absolutely not. - But then what? - I'm suggesting that perhaps the universe in our heads is more real than reality itself. - You got fired? When? How-how is that even possible? It's our sh-your show. - And you didn't even come home for dinner tonight, Cameron. What were you doing? - I was at the house. - The house is condemned. - Condemned? It has tape around it. The house is fine. - Oh, okay. - Linda. - Erin. Erin, you gotta see this rocket. It's not Russian. It's American. An Apollo service module. - What? - I think it's a sign. - A sign? - Yeah. - No, Cameron, the rocket is government property, and you're trespassing. You can get into real trouble here. Are you listening to yourself? You gotta figure out what to do about the show. - Are you listening to yourself? Remember when we used to talk about doing something fantastic? Whatever happened to that? - It's not that simple. - Gotcha. The Apollo rockets weren't simple, but in a way, they weren't complicated either. They operated in stages. These first three stages were just giant fuel tanks that were discarded as the rocket got higher and higher to shed payload and to maximize efficiency as the atmosphere thinned out. Pretty brilliant, right? Whoa. - It is, Cam. But to get to the moon, the CS module had to detach from these first three stages and fire up its own engine. This propelled the astronauts almost a quarter of a million miles- ooh, watch out for the asteroids- and into the moon's orbit. - Whoa. That's a long way away. - The view is so great from out here, Cam. Come see it. - But how would I get there? - So this is where you take all your dates to get murdered. - Dude, I like girls. Okay? So this isn't a date. You're just, like, the only other normal person in this town. - This isn't bad and all. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy your company. - Oh, how sweet of you. - You're doing a new one? Oh, no, no, no, no. That's cheating. - No, it's four! - No, that doesn't exist. - You said-I got it right! It was four. - It's pretty simple, actually. You just wanna cross-reference the new item with the museum database to see if we've already cataloged it or not. - So since it's an engine, we put it in which category? - That would be propulsion. Yep. - Got it. - Great. Just tab through and keep filling them in. Let me know if you have questions. - You know, I used to watch your show. - Oh. - They showed it in class sometimes. - Jeez. That's embarrassing. - Whatever happened to it? - Oh, I haven't been involved with it for years. - Oh. That's too bad. - No, no, it's fine. I had a lot of fun, but we just weren't really getting anywhere with the show, so... a lot of work for a lot of dead ends. How are you liking it here? - I love it here. This is, like, my dream job. - Really? - Totally. - Wow. This is your dream job? - Of course, down the road, I'd love to be at a national museum or something, but what about you? - Um, studied aerospace engineering and mathematics in grad school. - I mean, what did you wanna be when you grew up? - Um, you know, I don't think I really ever chose one thing. I just kind of wanted to leave it open, but I do remember telling people that I just wanted to do something fantastic. - That's amazing. I love that. - Well, it's...something. - Hey, dude. Uh, hi. - Oh, is this your friend? - Uh-huh. - Well, it sure is a pleasure to meet any friend of my son. - Uh, yeah, you too. I-I've heard so, um, little about you, actually. - Well, he is embarrassed of me. Uh, nice wheels, dude. - Hey, nice pants. - Uh, well, I mean, dress code says skirt or pants, so- - No, I really mean it. Some people are too quick to judge. Very progressive. Feminism. - Yeah. Yeah. For sure, man-no, I just- I just don't do dresses- - Okay. Uh, bye, Dad. - I-it was- it was nice to meet you. - Great to meet you. See you after school. - Yep. - Why don't we ever go to your house? I mean, your dad seems awesome. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - One of my photos just got published in "Metrobop Magazine." - Nice. - Was thinking you might want to pose for me sometime. - Yeah, sure. - Cool. - Dude, are you kidding me? - What? - "What?" Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's just because she's the worst. Dude, you can't be in one of her stupid pictures. - No, she's just insecure. I'm sure she's nice in there somewhere. - Whose side are you on? - Are you jealous? - Jealous. - Cameron, I'm glad you're here. As you've probably noticed, the condition is declining. Death has become a very real possibility. - Death? - It happened on my birthday. - What did? - Does that mean anything to you? - To me? - Yes. No. - Look, it's common for anyone at this later stage in life to begin to examine their past, to look back at their accomplishments and scrutinize their regrets- the big picture stuff. Most of us have no issue with this, but for someone with memory issues like this, looking back is not so easy. The brain is actually clogging up like plaque on teeth without a brain toothbrush. - So what do you suggest we do? - Antidepressants are a temporary solution, but frankly, mental stimulation is key. Now, the-the best way to combat this kind of thing is through sharing memories with a loved one, stories from the past. It's all up here in the mind. You understand? - Y-yeah. - Good. - You here to give me a shower? - No, the nurses give you showers, not me. - Well, then who are you? - I'm Cameron. You know me. - Oh, Cameron. Oh, of course. Hello. How are you? - I'm good. - Yeah. - Good. - Yeah. - How are you feeling? - Oh, fine. - Look, this is gonna sound crazy, but there was a rocket- well, part of a rocket- that fell in our backyard. They thought it was Russian, but it was- - Yeah. You told me this already. - You remember that? - Yeah. Yeah, you-you told me this the last time you visited. - I know, but I didn't think you'd remember. - You know, I used to fly rockets. - Fly? But you built rockets. An engineer. You didn't fly them. - Well, not yet. - Right. Right, well- I'm trying to take this rocket, build my own rocket. I'm thinking maybe you could tell me what some of the pieces are. You know, like, do you know what this is? - Yeah, it's the combine plate for the intake mount. - What about this one? - That's the engine valve for the nitrogen regulation. Um... - What-what would you say if I... took you home for a while? You know where you are? - Yeah, my room. - That's right. This is your old room. - Uh-huh. - You comfortable? - Mm-hmm. - Do you remember some of this stuff? - I recognize it. - It's nice to have you here. - Thank you. Thank you very much. It's been pretty exciting. I've been busy. - So you've done a few episodes of the show? - Two episodes. They're still editing, but... - That's amazing. So when does the show air? - Uh, tonight, Channel 34. Uh, hopefully you can all watch. Uh, this is my son. Say hello to everyone. - Hi. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - This is Father Thomas. - Welcome. - Where were you? - I'm sorry. - Were you with that girl? - No, sir. I was working on my application. - So you've decided on a branch, then. - Air Force. - Good, good. Very respectable. The next time you decide to be late, don't bother showing up at all. It's embarrassing. - Hi. - Oh, hey. - How's it coming? - Great. See? Got the LOX tank. Fuel vent's a little burnt, but still functional. No idea how I'm gonna get the thrust to get this off the ground, but... well, do you got any ideas? - Oh. I don't actually know that much about rockets, but Dad would know. - Yeah. Uh, I-I'll get there. It's just the slosh baffles. And the heat diffuses somehow. - You know, you're a lot like him, my dad. - Yeah. I've heard. - Yeah. I mean the good parts of him. You're like the version of him I wish he was. - Oh. Well, thanks. - Yeah. I mean... I used to want to be him, you know. I used to dress like him and act like him. Well, I never really knew my mom, so I guess he was the only real example I had. So... In any case, as I get older, things are starting to- well, it's complicated. Yeah. I know the feeling. You wanna see the rocket? - Right, so this was all part of the airplane that came in. - But this one's a rocket engine. - Yes, yes. This one would be attached to the service module. So it's actually this guy that propels the rocket from Earth all the way to the moon and then back again before it detaches from the command module, which is that little pod with the astronauts in it that splashed down in the ocean. - So this went to space? - Not this one specifically, 'cause this was actually a backup. - So what happens to the service module? - Oh, those are normally just cast off until they burn up in the atmosphere. - Really? - Yeah. It's kind of sad, isn't it? I'll be right back. - Holy. You built this thing in, like, a month? - Yeah. - Wow. Is there gonna be enough room for you in there? - For what? - Well, for you to fit in there. I mean, it looks kind of small. You're the one who's gonna be in the rocket, right? - Yeah. - Are you excited? - Yeah, uh, yes. Of course I'm excited. Thank you. - Fantastic. Now, they're gonna reach out directly with the offer. You have about two weeks before she retires, so you can get things together here. - Sure. Yeah. - Okay. I gotta go to work. - Okay. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - So do you really think this thing's gonna fly? - Eventually. Eventually. Testing it out today. - What, really? - Just a test of the boosters. I gotta make sure this thing doesn't blow up when I turn it on. This sucker is gonna prove to the world that I'm worth a damn. Copley, here I come. Hey, I'm about to do a test of the booster. You wanna check it out? - Yeah. - I'll grab your coat. - Oh, okay. - Okay. Here we are. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to a beautiful day here in Fairview. Not the most ideal conditions. - No. - But we are looking at a simple test of the boosters. Hold that, my friend. Here we go. Ta-da! - Whoa. Oh. All right. Here we go. ♪ Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh ♪ Just a test to the booster, but here we go. Auxiliary power initiating. Stand by. - All right. - Three, two, one. - What? - Wait- Okay. - What's going on? - It's not working. Oh, wow! Uh, h-hold this. - The universe is factual. It's objective, study-able, and concrete. It has no emotions and no feelings. The universe is rational. Chemistry. Mathematics. Biology. Earth sciences. Physics. So come explore science as we go "Above and Beyond." What is an experiment? An experiment is a procedure carried out to refute or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause and effect by demonstrating what outcomes occur when a particular factor is manipulated. - Cheers to that. Thanks, Lin. - It's just amazing. They're finally seeing your potential. What's wrong? I just- I'm not sure it's the right path for me. You know, I think I was hoping to transition into something hands-on like the technicians department or... plus it's a two-hour commute each way. And I don't even know where I'm gonna be living once the divorce is finalized in a couple months. - But you said it yourself. People wait their whole lives for an opportunity like this. - Yes. Yes, I know. I know. - Are you worried about Cameron? - No. I mean, I think he should know before I commit- - To be blunt, he's really lost it. He's been sleeping in your condemned house for weeks. It's not rational. It'll be good for you to get away from him. Start fresh. Anyways, I'm just- I'm really happy for you. You either take that job or... go back to the way things were. Well, I think we need another refill here. Maybe some champagne... Sneaking out? - Nah, just going for a walk. - Huh. Usually, people use a door for that kind of thing. - I, uh, take it the test didn't go so well, huh? - Oh, it was a huge success. Liquid oxygen froze around the intake valve, which built up pressure until it popped and sprayed everywhere. Lit the garage on fire. - Hm. At Cornell, I had published three articles in the "Astrophysical Journal" by the time I was 21. Won the damn Crawford. Now I'm stuck building a DIY rocket out of a hunk of Apollo garbage just to prove I'm worth a damn. I'm almost 50 years old. Is that what I'm supposed to be doing? Jesus. Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity when he was 26. You know what I'm gonna be known for? A failed children's television show... And a rocket that didn't lift off. It's kind of poetic, really. Heed this warning: do not grow old. Huh. - Hey, it's that woman again. - Yeah. I don't know if she's following me or you. - Entropy, the gradual decaying of stuff. Believe it or not, over time, we're all headed towards chaos. The natural state of the universe is, in fact, chaos, not order. - What are you doing awake? - We can try to organize our stuff and control it, but in the end, it will always find its way back to chaos. - Well, that sounds kind of harsh, don't you think, Erin? - Oh, it's just maximum entropy, Cam. It's science! Good evening, madam. - Shut up. - Oh, hey. - You good? - Lookee what I got. - What is this? I mangled it a bit. Sorry. "Darcy Penzone is having a Halloween party." That's stupid. - Do you want to go with? - No, definitely not. Did she, like, invite you or something? - Are you jealous again? - I mean, y- kind of, yeah, I guess. - Oh, I thought I wasn't your type. - No, I'm jealous because she invited you and not me. - Huh. Are you sure you're gay? - What? What-yeah. Yes, I am. I totally am. - I mean, no judgment. Just asking. - I've never, uh- I've never actually been with a guy before, so that's- yep, that's that. - So...have you been with a girl before? - I made out with this girl from Redding my freshman year. Um, but it was like, some older dudes dared us to at this dumb lacrosse party thing. - Could be some fun. - I mean, what did you expect, though, asking that question, whether I wanted to go to Darcy Penzone's Halloween party? - I figured it would be a no, but of course I'm gonna ask. - Wow, well, that's very polite of you. Um, but the answer is still no. - Mm-hmm. - Why? Because I hate her guts. Like... people wanna put you in a box, you know, like, a category and... Like, I've tried to do that too, but, um, it just- it just seems to make it simpler for everyone else and, like, way more complicated for me. And I try not to care what they think, but I do. I-I definitely do. I just, um- in the end, it's just easier to go along with it all, you know? But I don't know if that's how, like, I actually feel. Like, I don't even know if I have a preference. Like, if that's even a thing. I just, um... still figuring it out or whatever. - Hm. Well, I mean, I like to wear girls' underwear sometimes. - You do? - Yeah. So, see, nothing is really that simple. Plus, if it helps, I've never been with anyone before. So there's that. - Really? You? I thought you would've already. - Why's that? - Because. Because you're... cute. - Wow. - Shut up, dude. - A bona fide compliment from the bisexual in the room. I mean, you can't take it back. - No, that was a- - There's no take-backsies. I guess you're right then. It's just, uh- it's not that simple, is it, huh? - Maybe it should be. You know? Simply put, we don't fit in, probably never will, but that's okay. It's all up here, right, in the mind? So- - Cheers to our abnormal future. - Oh. May it always be fantastic. - Fantastic. I like it. No. Nope. No. There's no way I'm spending my- nay, our birthday, what, at Darcy Penzone's Halloween party? No. No. Because we... should throw our own party. A, um- a fantastic party. Well, go on. - A more fantastic Halloween party. - Thanks. - "Fantastic Halloween party"? What does that even mean? - It's, like, totally over your head. Don't worry. - Are you going to this? - Yeah. I'm organizing it. You should come. I can't believe this. Okay. No one's gonna go to your dykey party because they're gonna come to mine. - Oh, I didn't know that you were throwing a dykey party too. I'm sorry. - You're just so funny. - Thanks. I thought it was funny. - Well, it was worth a shot. - Yeah. - Hey. - What the hell happened to our garage? - It was, um... - What is this, Cameron? - I was building- I was trying to build a rocket. - A rocket? In the garage? - Yeah. But it clearly didn't work. So- - Cameron. This is insane. What are you even talking about? This-it's breaking the law. - Since when did you care about rules so much? - Well, someone had to. - Look, I'll fix it all back. It's- - Oh, really? - Erin. - I-I don't- I just wanted to- I came here to talk to you about a job, Cameron. I got a job offer at the Wright-Patterson, and I just wanted to get your... - Well, that's great. - I don't know, get your second opinion or whatever. I just wanted to talk to you. But I can't 'cause I don't know where you are. - This is the second law of thermodynamics, and I bring this up because I know you might be thinking, "Dr. Fuller, this is a math class. "Come on. Why are we learning about science?" Well, this law impacts statistics, game theory, systems, analytics, and even parts of linguistics. It is essential for understanding how things work and even how people think. But it's not as easy to predict as you might imagine. All right, class. Come on. Settle down. - You really stepped in there, huh? - Yeah, well, you probably would've killed her if I didn't. - That's a great point. You okay? - I don't even know where to start. What were you thinking? - That those kids were assholes. I was sick of it. - Look, maybe that wasn't the best option. - Yeah, sure. - Sure? This is going to be on your permanent record, and you have a 4.0. For Christ's sakes, you have your interview with MIT next month. Do you just wanna ruin all of that? I-I am trying to understand what has gotten into you. - You're blowing this way out of proportion. - Is it the new boy that you've been dating? - You don't even know him, and no, we're not-we're not dating. - Okay, fine, not dating. Is it the new boy you have been sneaking out at night to see? - He-he's a real good kid actually. - Oh, is he? Then I'm sure his father is actually upset with him. - God, this is bullshit. - Don't use that language. - No, I'll do whatever I want. - I am not going to permit you to hang out with that boy anymore. - They're just friends. - You have no say in this anymore, Cameron. Really? When I leave, do whatever you want. - Leaving? What the hell is that about? - Apparently, I'm the only one in this car who's even remotely rational anymore. - Rational? Is that what you've become? That's what you call it, is rational? - That's enough. - You're not rational. - That is enough. - How did you marry this woman? I mean, like, seriously, all she ever does is sit around and complain like some old lady. - Fuck you! - So... What happened? - Nothing. - Hm. They don't send you home for nothing. - It was just a stupid fight. - Is it the girl you've been hanging out with? - No, sir. It's not her. - Oh. I don't want you hanging out with that girl anymore. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - You're doing this to yourself. If I see you with that queer one more time, I'll kill you. Let me try an experiment. Say I take a rubber band and I stretch it out between my finger. This creates stored potential energy. Now, really, energy is the only thing that can counteract... The effects of entropy. Now, let's take a look- Thanks, buddy. How you doing? - I can't believe I said that. Who does that? What's happening, Cameron? - Sometimes, things just happen. - It's not that simple. - I think it might be, actually. - Want some? - Yeah. - So you're leaving? - I got a job offer at Wright-Patt. - Wow. Congratulations, yeah. - I'm not gonna go. - Why not? - Because it's someone else's dream. - Um, I'm- I'm sorry about before. - You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm the one that needs to apologize. I said something that I so wish I could take back. - I don't know what I'm doing. - So what? Who cares? - Yeah. - You are gonna be just fine. You are intelligent and so confident and strong-willed and one of the most loyal people on this Earth. And yeah, there's gonna be some ups and downs, but I can tell you that no matter what you choose to do or who you choose to be, it'll be the right decision. - Thanks. Can I ask you something? What did you wanna be when you grew up? What was your dream? - Hey. I, uh- I nabbed it from the museum. It's pretty cool, huh? - What are you doing? - Something fantastic. Aw, Merry Christmas to you too, Cam. - Well, it's not Christmas yet, Erin, - Oh, but you were talking about the north pole. - It's Halloween. - All right, well, where's your costume then? - Hey, I'm home. - I think I'm pale like a ghost. Our planet is filled... - Hello? - With liquid molten metals. - Ooh, spooky. - It's my birthday, you know. - Which turn our planet into an enormous magnet. But our planet isn't the only thing with a magnetic field. Am I right, Erin? - That's right, Cam. The sun also has one. And the sun's magnetic field is much more powerful. It can cause sunspots-- - Always leaving this dang thing on. - Television screen go fuzz- - Hey, where is, everyone? - Cameron is being completely irrational. And it seems Erin has joined him. - Well, you won't technically have a display console, but you know what? Neither did John Glenn. - John Glenn? Never heard of him. What are we gonna do about propulsion? - Oh, this thing actually still had a significant store of liquid H2 in it. - Sweet. - Yeah. I think it might be enough to get you to the L point. - It might be? Well, that's a relief. That is-it might be. - Well, what are you gonna do? Siphon gas out of the wagon? It's gonna be fine. - This is so crazy. - Yeah. - No, I agree with Cameron on this one. - Hi. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Great. Thanks. Um, I'm decorating the house. I'm having a Halloween party. So obviously, you're not invited. Please don't come. - Obviously. Where's your witch costume? - Um, yeah, Darcy Penzone decided to dress as a witch today too, so now I am costume-less. - Sorry. What are you gonna do? - I was gonna raid your closet. - Sure. Yes, of course. You could just go as yourself. - No. - She's like a bundle of positivity. What about over here? - You made it. - A dress? - Oh, well, I mean, sort of. It's my worst nightmare, a housewife. - Yeah. I mean, yeah, you look horrific. - Wow. Thank you. - I mean, fantastic. - It's for you. Come on, let's, uh, find you a costume. Party's about to start. - You have an extra? - Honey, where is everyone? I-I thought the party started at eight. - Okay. I think this is ready to go. Come on. Let's get it outside. Cameron. Cameron. Cameron. - Open your eyes. - Cameron. - Yeah. - Are you sure you wanna do this? - The launch isn't gonna happen, okay? It's not gonna work. It didn't work. I can't launch a rocket from our garage. It's- - Not that simple. Why do you always tell yourself that? - I just wanted to do something... you know. - Do you know what that is? - I know what a Moebius strip is. - It only has one side. Yeah. It's a mathematical paradox. - It's not that simple. - Oh, it might be. Who knows? - It happened on my birthday. - What did? - Cameron. You remember me? - Does that mean anything to you? - Can I come to your stupid party or whatever? - Under one condition: you take our photo. - Whatever. Fine. Out here. - It's all up here in the mind. You understand? - I said, can you open your eyes for me, Cameron? You're looking good. Do you know who I am? Cameron. Do you know who I am? - I might. - Do you recognize any of this stuff? Here. Do you know who this is? That's you, Cameron. Over 50 years ago. And that's me. Do you recognize this photo? - Sam. - Sam? - Yeah. - Sam isn't in this picture. He was stillborn. Remember? - Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli... We never knew what he would look like. - The brain is actually clogging up like plaque on teeth without a brain toothbrush. - I think I know what's happening. - I think you do too. - I'm scared. - I'm here. I'll always be here. I show you these things every day. How we met, our life together. This week's scientific discovery is... Rockets! - Over there, there's-there's somebody over there for you. Do you know who I am? Erin. - Mm-hmm. - Hi, Cam. You've been here a few weeks now. Oh. Your father's car. Do you remember your father? He tried to run you over at our Halloween party. Do you remember that? Cameron? Cameron? - This is the end, isn't it? - Don't worry. Don't worry. The doctor's on his way. - It's about to happen. - What is? - The launch. The launch. It's about to happen. - No, there- there was no rocket launch. I told you that, remember? - Time is running out, Erin. We have to go. Help me. - I'm sorry. - Help me. - I'm sorry. I can't. I can't. - With the rocket. - Oh, Cameron. - The rocket. - The rocket- The rocket is coming. It's coming. Come on! Cameron, hurry up. The countdown has started. Don't you worry, love. I'll make sure it's there for you. - Thank you. - Ma'am, I'm sorry. You can't go with him. - Oh, I'm going with him. - Two seats? - Yeah. I'm coming with you. - But you don't have a suit. - I'll be okay. - Close your eyes. - Go ahead. Most people think it's just a black abyss, but in fact, the universe appears. - Look closely. Do you see it? - It's faint, but... it's there if you concentrate. - It's probably colorful and shifting. - It's evolving and growing. Do you see it? - What you're seeing is entirely unique to you. - It's a kind of fingerprint, your own personal universe. - I used to look up to you. I used to act like you, dress like you. I wanted to be you. - I know. - Then why did you do it? - You did this to yourself. - That's not true. Things are gonna be different this time. Now, open your eyes.
