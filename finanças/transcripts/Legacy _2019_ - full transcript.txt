Please, no touching. Madam, have you found anything? Please, look carefully and tell us if there's anything missing. His black jeans, I think. But he never wore them to school. And a t-shirt... No, here it is. -And the shirt I bought him? -It's here. Are you sure no other clothes are missing? No, I'm telling you, he would never have left like this. It's important to remember what he wore when you last saw him. I saw him in the morning, he still had his house clothes on. A green t-shirt, I think, and... Tracksuit pants, maybe. It's been days! Do you remember what you wore last week? Or what your wife, brothers, kids wore? Please take a seat and let me talk to the lady. Take a seat. I'll get to you soon. Where does he keep his luggage? -Here. -Is it there? Yes. But he wouldn't have left for so many days without a sign. You know how it is -stress, fatigue... It makes you want to pack your bags, take a one-week break on the Champs-Élysées. Then you come back all fresh. In the middle of the semester? No, Anton is a responsible person. Anyway, he would have called. You mean he's never left without notice? Let me look for his passport. It's here. I thought he got away for the weekend, he sometimes does that. He'd switch off his phone, saying he needed to clear his mind. But he's been gone too long! Any favourite place? He's not too fond of crowded places. What was the longest time he didn't give a sign? An extended weekend, three-four days. When did this happen? December, I think. He went skiing, that I remember. Where? Alone? At Izvoru Mureșului. Yes, alone. How often do you talk on the phone? Even twice a day, if we have to. How often do you see each other? Two-three times a week, we help each other out as best we can. We only have each other, since our parents died. Both parents? Yes, in a car accident. When? Almost twelve years now. How did your brother cope? We were grown-ups, he was 22, I was 24. I was fresh out of university, he was still a student. I was afraid he'd give up, but he buried himself in work to overcome the shock. How do you like it? The one Cristi bought you is better. That communist stuff? They won't let me in. It's fine, I'll make you a fancy knot. Sit down. -Is that a new mole? -Yes. It wasn't there before. Now it is. Sorry I can't come tonight. Don't worry, they'll film us. Anton, it's not the same. Then come. No need to, they'll film you. I sometimes nagged him. I've never come to terms with him giving up concerts... the Philharmonic. That was his reason to live! It might sound like a cliché, but he is truly brilliant. Ask anyone. Actually, you may have heard of him. Why did he quit, then? Anton has always been like that. It's like a demon in him won't let him enjoy anything. May we take these two? I have recent photos in my phone. Cristi, where's my bag? These will do, they are quite clear. We'll take care of them. You'll get them back. -Any social media accounts? -No. It's not like him. One more thing. I know he's not married, but perhaps a girlfriend, a sweetheart? He's dating a pharmacist, Nora Pavel, but they don't live together. Please think, does anything look different? For instance, are the chairs in their usual places? It's important. I can't tell. Please make a list of Anton's acquaintances. People he met with, or who came to his place. Anyone important -family, friends, their relationship. -He doesn't really have friends. -Enemies, then -even better. Since you can't sit still, let's have a little chat. Let's make that list. -Help her out with questions. -Yeah. Let me get something to write. I'm listening. At first, I was sure he had gone off to unwind for a few days. Single guy, no one to answer to... But now... It's been two days since I started calling co-workers around hospitals. Like I told your colleague, I'm worried he fell somewhere and lost consciousness. -Why do you say that? -With his issues... What issues? She doesn't know? She does know something, but not how serious it is. Anton made me swear not to tell her. For two months I begged him to get tests. I'd noticed he wasn't well. How much longer? Tell me, how much longer have I got? Don't jump to conclusions! Tell me, how much? Come with me. We need to run another batch of tests before we can tell just what the deal is. If need be, we can try Austria, perhaps your fame will help. Do they check your résumé? It's a simple question. How much? Anton, help me help you! I asked you a question! -It's not that simple. -How is it then? We need to run more tests to be sure how we stand. Then we'll know what we need to do. I got that, Doc. But right now, looking at this shit in my head, is it that hard to tell how long I have left? Fine, if you insist. But it's no good, the oncologist alone can tell. A glioblastoma in that position requires an anatomical-pathological and immunohistochemical exam. In Romanian, please? Based on what we saw in the MRI, the tumor gives you another seven-eight months. A year, maybe. But again, I venture an opinion, which is not OK. Many other factors are... -Anton, listen. -Will you be quiet? No one must know about this shit in my head. Let's stay calm. -Don't I look calm? -Then listen! I don't care about what you're trying to say. Was he just acting brave? Did he want to fight the illness or...? With Anton, it's hard to tell. When I... -May I? -All done? Thank you. -Hello. -Hello. How is it? Anything new? We hope the commissioners here will help. Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. Eleonora Pavel. Any leads? Are you Anton Ropot's girlfriend? Yes. Could you come to the precinct tomorrow afternoon? I'm working, but I'll make it. That would be great. Excuse me. -How are you holding up? -So and so. In all this madness... You must take these pills at least during the first trimester. Did you take your folic acid? Anything else you may recall... How did he get along with the neighbours? Fine... Well, up to a point. Most of them are elderly. OK. -And the building administrator? -His office is by the entrance. He was downstairs just now. Call anytime. Any clue is important. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Hot stuff, that pharmacist. That's none of our business. Speaking of, there's a guy on the list, Victor Bodea. -Old client of ours. -What for? A bar fight. Both guys had smoked weed. That's it? -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Go find the administrator. Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. I have a few questions about your neighbour here. Did you get all your luggage? Do you need any help? Do you? What number was it? Two. Here it is. This is it. -Which floor was it? -Third. -Which floor? -Third. He's a night crawler. Let's hope he's in. Hello. Chief Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. Sub commissioner Florin Bejan. Cool. What's up? -We'd like a word with you. -Not now. My taxi is waiting. -There was no taxi downstairs. -It's on its way. So what's the deal? What is your relationship with Anton Ropot? -Why? -Just curious. We're friends, we met in university. -Why do you ask? -Did you study at the Conservatory? I said we met in university, not that we were colleagues. How often do you meet? Every month or two. A drink, a chat -guy stuff. A smoke, too? Not any longer. When did you last see him? About six weeks ago, at a friend's birthday party. Dan Simion. Did he mention he was going to leave town, or go abroad? I have no idea. What were you doing last Thursday about noon? Last Thursday? I went to... see my parents. Around 11. They're in Târgu Mureș. I see. And last Friday? I came back Saturday evening. What happened, though? Weren't you in a hurry? Thank you. Just leave it as it is. There's no problem at all. Excuse me, who are you? How did you get up there? -Hello. -Hello. Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. We spoke earlier. Right, I'm coming. Go back around, I'll meet you on the corridor. Sure. Take a break. -What happened to him? -We don't know. He's been missing for a few days. Anton likes to surprise people. Did his resignation from the Philharmonic come as a surprise too? Anton was among the best of his generation. He aimed to become a Rachmaninoff. That kind of talent is born once in a century. I also know that he was eager to write music. He was tormented by his inability to compose, at least not to the level of his performance. He made several attempts. I encouraged him to introduce one piece before an encore, but... He kept thinking he had failed his calling. When did he retire? Two years ago. He left just before the fall season. Did you keep in touch? During the first year we spoke quite often. I kept hoping he might change his mind, but we gradually grew apart. Has he kept in touch with any of his colleagues here? You should ask them. They are in the dressing room. We had a competition this Saturday. We had rehearsals scheduled with him this Thursday. Hello. Did he miss class before? Yes, two weeks ago. He wasn't feeling well. Another teacher stood in for him. But now he didn't warn us, teachers are busy with the competition... I'm afraid we couldn't manage it very well. I had a class with him from four to five. As a teacher, he didn't like us always checking the time. Toma, my man, what did the man do to offend you? Has he ever said anything? To him, I wasn't worth the waste of breath. Sure, he had talent galore. But many others do! Anyone here could play in a world-class orchestra without embarrassing themselves. Just think, you get standing ovations, and then he acts like he's a god and you're his bell-boy. Do you have no sense of shame? I'm only here now thanks to Anton! You had it coming! You were saying we could speak in private. Now, of all times, you talk about shame? Let him be. Please, I'm listening. It was in... -What's your name? -Sandu Ciprian, bassoon. Go on. Six or seven years ago, we had a situation... I had some family issues, and one day I had one drink too many. -Then another one... -Then another two... Believe me, that's not me, but that time I went on a bender. I was late for the concert and I was... So you were sloshed. How bad did it go? Terribly bad. They suspended me and moved to terminate my contract. Anton threatened to leave if I got sacked without notice. So you were friends? No, we weren't. We'd have the occasional chat, but... Anton is rather introverted. What can I say... Mr. Ropot looked tired lately. He said he had severe anaemia but we shouldn't worry. Frankly, he didn't look well. So when he rejected my call I thought he might need some rest. -Was the call rejected or unanswered? -Rejected, at first. Then he switched off his phone. -I sometimes miss classes too. -That's his schedule? Yes. So that was on Thursday. When did you notice his prolonged absence? He had no classes on Friday, so we only noticed on Monday. Shouldn't he have gone to the competition with his class? Indeed, but... No need, thank you. Any teacher can accompany them. So you grew worried and did what? I asked a colleague to go to his place, but no one answered. Sadly, we don't have family details. -I know he has a sister. -You never thought to call 911? Of course we did. But, you see, Mr. Ropot can be rather quick-tempered. He might have reacted badly to us getting worked up for no reason. So we only called last evening, but his sister must have announced it already. Hi. What? And the fishing reel? Thanks, I'll try to come pick it up this evening. Anything else? Got any more lies in the pipeline and no one to tell them to? Stop what? You're the one treating me like dirt! Hi. Where's Bejan? -He's out. -Left already? Alright. -Sir! -Hello. -Sorry. -You took your time. I'm sorry. Let's talk in my office. Lidia, will you please bring the recorder? Of course. Please. Take a seat. I think the battery is dead. I'll be right back. Will you get some water too? I've never thought I'd have coffee at the police station. Besides, I've already had two. -One more? -Definitely not. I'll charge you with poisoning. Thank you. Leave it to me. I'll do it. Where are you? There. You don't mind me turning on the recorder? Do I have a choice? So... I'll ask you some questions. How long have you been with Anton Ropot? Almost three years. I gather you don't live together. No, we're fine like this. I'm not the clingy kind. -How often do you see each other? -Two-three times a week. When did you last see him? Last weekend. The one before his disappearance. Please tell me about the last few days before he disappeared. Nothing unusual. Friday evening we went to a play. -Where? -These need your signature. I'll do it later. Just leave it over there. Where? Does it really matter? Do I need an alibi for a day when nothing happened? Come, be reasonable... At the National Theater. "The Glass Menagerie". There you go. And then? We went to a Japanese restaurant. We didn't stay long. Why not? Anton has some health issues and he wasn't feeling well. Can you be more specific? He had a headache. We asked for takeaway and went home, where he felt better. Tell me... Has he been looking like... Like something was troubling him? He did seem a bit absent-minded. He told me he was tired. There's no point pestering him with questions. When was the last time you spoke on the phone? Sorry. I called him on Tuesday evening. He sounded lively. -Did he mention any meeting? -No. Did he have a favourite place to go when he was stressed or tired? Not that I know of. I can only mention places we've been to together We've had few holidays, most of them abroad. I love the sun, he not so much. We'd choose destinations for sun and sightseeing. We've been to Italy, Portugal... Did you travel with a group of friends? Just the two of us. Anton has few friends. Think carefully! Has Anton had any conflicts lately? Not quite conflict, and I've never witnessed it myself, but lately he had been avoiding Cristi, his brother-in-law. Avoiding him? He would reject his calls. When Cristi called, he... Did you ask about it? I did, and he said it was just me. And you didn't press him? Perhaps I was afraid of what I'd learn. -How long had this been going on? -At least a few months. I see. We're done for now. Please make a written statement. Take this. Put down what you've told me. Start with your name and address, "I, the undersigned"... Please write everything down and sign it. This won't write. This one neither. -Good morning. -What's the matter? -Nothing, I'd like a word. -Can I finish my rounds? -Just a minute. -Alright. When exactly did you last see Anton? You alone, not with your wife. Some ten days ago, when I went to pick up Ana. Why? I hear you were not on friendly terms. -Neighbours' grapevine? -I need to know why. Anton can't stand me bothering him with the tests, forcing him to make a decision about the treatment. He doesn't like you as a mother-hen? I appreciate your sarcasm, but surely you know that in some situations, any delay can be lethal. Did he plan to go to a hospital abroad? I've been trying to tell him about our medical partners. Maybe he avoided me so I wouldn't tell Ana. But he had to see the oncologist. I sent him to see Caius Dobrescu. He has a huge waiting list. -He's at-- -My colleague is on it. Think some more. It's best if I learn from you. What caused this tension? That's all I can say. Yes? Listen, damn it. All it matters now is-- I'll tell you what and who matters to me now! -I guess you mean Ana, but-- -You guess right. I just want her to move on and stay out of trouble so this shit doesn't grow in her head too. There's no sign that your disease runs in the family. Your parents had no cancer history. We'll get Ana her regular check-ups, but for now-- You, of all people, insist on the tests! Why? We all have a purpose for living. I know Ana better than anyone: Her purpose is to give life. Or she'll wither or get one of these things in her head. -Is that why you're here? -Yes. 7 years, and she's never been pregnant! Although it means the world to her! -And you blame me? -Yes. You don't know a thing. I know Ana gets regular tests. And you? -What? -Is it so hard to go and jerk off? Maybe I just don't want to jerk off in a jar at work! -Besides, children come-- -When God sends them. Bullshit. You think I don't know why you won't get tested? You used to play handball, got hit in the balls loads of times, so that might, I say might, have caused your problem. I know you love Ana and you're afraid to lose her. But you must get tested for her sake. For your own, too. Maybe it's nothing serious. Do you have to hear it from me, Doc? And if it is serious, let her go. Can't you see it eating at her, much as she's trying to comfort you? If she withers by your side, will that make you happy? You still have time to find someone for whom it doesn't matter. I know you have a temper, and with the bad news... Doctor, you are needed in room eight. I'm coming. -But you're worse than I thought. -I'm perfectly lucid. You know it. Then who the fuck do you think you are? Deciding who should have a baby, who should divorce... Who are you, God Almighty? Hello. I'm off to Curtea de Argeș. His card was used there on the evening of the 18th. -No word from the Intelligence? -No. Nor the Border Police. Dobrescu recommended him Austria or France. And? You should see his face when I squeezed the info out of him! He was going to do the paperwork. Ropot threatened to blow the whistle if his name was bumped up. -He insisted to wait in line? -Sort of. OK, we'll talk when you get there. -Hello. -Just a moment. -How can we help you? -I'd like to see the doctor. -Are you registered with us? -Yes. Name? Oh, I just want a short word with her. -OK. -Thank you. Excuse me, doctor. Someone is asking for you. -Hello. -Hello. Do you have any news? What's going on-- So, what's going on between your brother and your husband? What do you mean? I hear there's some tension there. Cristi thinks I spend too much time at his place. He doesn't understand that's home to me, too. I lived there for so long. He thinks I work too hard cooking for Anton occasionally or ironing a shirt for him. Has your relationship always been like this? Anton and I have always supported each other. So your husband knew the deal when you got married. Why this friction between them? Whatever gossip you've heard, they're just two strong personalities. -They're too busy to meet often. -You're not helping. -How come? -You're not helping me with Anton at all. -What do you think-- -Can we go now, Doctor? Yes. Keep him indoors for a few days. Thank you very much. What would Anton be doing in Curtea de Argeș? Was he seen there? -Any relatives or acquaintances there? -No. We used to visit a monastery there with our parents. Why? Have you learned anything? We'll keep you posted as much as the investigation allows it. -Have a good day. -You too. I spoke with Cristi. He says you're having some problems and you should have some tests done. What else did he say? Was there more? I don't know. Maybe he told you more than he told me. I quote: "I hope he won't get stubborn about going to get tested." Didn't he mention he should get tested too? I forgot to buy bread. -Won't you eat? -I had my lunch at work. Ever thought of breaking up with Cristi? No, Anton, I haven't. But you love him, right? Yes, I do, and you know it. And you'll love him for the rest of your life? Probably. And he knows it. Then, why does he refuse to get tested? Have some salad. It appears Ropot was seen around the monastery. He seems to love standing people up. He talked with the priest but failed to show up the next day. Hello? I have poor coverage here. I'll look around and call you later. Bye. Fuck! I'm sorry, God. Hello, Father. -God bless you. -Do you have a minute? Florin Bejan, Precinct 4, looking for someone. I know. So my colleague told you. I'm looking for this man. I know he was here, maybe you've seen him, or you have some information. Any detail helps. You know... As night follows day, sadness follows empty glory. You see, love without truth is blind. And truth without love is cruelty. OK, I understand. Have you seen him, though? And we are vanquished not by wickedness, but by the cunning of the devil. Thank you for coming. Go with God! You tell him: chicken, fish and dick are to be tasted bit by bit. Oh, we have a poet here! Yeah, man, broads acting like prudes. He's coming out! Come on! Go! It's them. Cut them off. Fuck! Cut them off! It turned. We got them, it's a dead end. -It keeps falling. -Fuck it! Stay close. Don't let them get away. It's OK, it's a dead end. It stops here. -You got the fuckers. -Right away. There they go! Stop! -Stop, police! -Fucking belt! -Stop! -Down on the ground! -Get down! -Down! Hands behind your back. That hurts! Get that one, too. Hold up. You take the driver, I'll take the artist. Yes, Sir. Take a break. "Schumacher", you come with me. Your mother said what you told her to say. Sweetie, be so kind and close the door. We heard you like to make an impression, it seems it was true. Go figure! What did you do last Thursday? -I had a rehearsal. -When? -In the morning, around 9:00. -For how long? -This has nothing to do with - -That's up to us. How long? I haven't seen Anton all month. Why not? Because sometimes he'd ask me for... What? What you saw earlier. But last time it was just weed. Something's wrong with him. Anton-Anton, you fucking moron, you're a cool guy, but you've got kind of quirky lately. Yeah. Like you're any better. You bet I am. Indeed. I sleep and wake up whenever I want, I fuck anyone I want... well, maybe not anyone. Good for you. It's good to do what you want. I'd be even better if weed got legalised. Prostitution, too. In a country full of churches and shawarma places, it would really be something. But I'll be fucked if I get you. You can't understand anyway. Whatever. You expect me to suck up to your ass? Like all the idiots. Me being chief idiot. Stuff it! You got a boner when people cheered for you. So? I was still a wanker. No one died when I left. I did nothing to be remembered for. Man, are you OK? What's wrong with you? Here. What is it? Want an ambulance? I'm calling. If they smell a rat, don't tell them you got it from me. I don't want to die! -You won't die, are you daft? -I don't want to die! -Come on. -I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Dude, what's wrong with you? There, there. I don't want to die, you hear me? I don't get this shit. Next time he called, I chose not to answer. Write it all down. Including what you did last Thursday and Friday, with alibis. Fuck me, this has nothing to do with... -This is all personal. -Keep writing. You're left-handed? Fishy guy. -Morning. How are you? -Fine, and you? Now I'm a part-time nurse, do I have a choice? Nice. -Some coffee? -If you would. -Where's our man? -In there, laid up. -Hey, what's up? -Hello! How did you pull it off? By being an idiot. It's not that bad, though. Sit down. Here. Aw, how sweet! Keep him busy or he'll grow mouldy. I'll get him to grade papers for me. Thanks. I'll work him hard after the wedding. Until then, I'm playing sweet. So will you postpone the wedding? Or I could marry myself. Not bad at all! Am I invited? I'll think about it. Listen to what one of my pupils wrote: "Ștefan Augustin Doinaș wrote The Silver-Tusked Boar, in the end, the guy dies but the pig makes it." Here's a good one: "Poets had no idea what they were writing about, so we are always asked 'what the author meant'." -That's our guy on TV! -Hush! Sources disagree on when the artist was last seen, whether at home or at the high school where he taught. Ropot's retirement two years ago, at the peak of his career, raised many questions. Neither his family nor the police will talk to the press. If you have any information... I told his sister we have to tell them something. Turn it down. It's Mareș. Yeah. What? Are you sure? Alright, I'm coming. What's up? He's found a guy, but he's a mess. -Let's go. -You stay where you are. Relax, I'll call you. -Ciao. -Bye. Put him back. He was found in a forest in Argeș. -He had animal bite marks. -He was already dead. Blunt force trauma to the head. Maybe someone is looking for him too. Of what we have, his description was closest to... To your brother. I'm sorry you had to go through this, but... Let's go. Hi. Fancy dining, huh? Yeah. I called you earlier. -I didn't hear the phone. -Târgu Mureș called. -So? -That kid... Bodea. He really was there Thursday through Saturday. He dropped the stuff at his parent's house. He's withdrawing his statement? Now that you know about his dealing, he wanted to keep them out of this shit. -See you later. Enjoy your lunch. -Thanks. -Good evening. -Good evening. I looked for you at the pharmacy. Yes? I'd like to have a little chat. You could have called. Thank you. Is this visit part of the grilling? Let's call it a chat. Do you usually show up like this? -Part of the job. -I see. -I wanted to ask - -Want some lemonade? Yes. Did you give Anton drugs you weren't supposed to? You think I'm that irresponsible? You think I'm that thoughtless? Hold on. I'm not accusing you of anything, just asking. You may very well have had the best intentions. But you know there can be side effects. We're now testing all leads. It's very possible that Anton is somewhere, in critical condition, with no one to help him. Do you understand? You think I don't imagine that all the time? Asking myself a thousand questions? But, you know, Anton is very proud. Perhaps too proud. He didn't like asking for help. If I gave him something in an emergency, I knew exactly what I was doing. When I found Tramadol on him, I threw it away. Relax. Did he take any medicine before disappearing? Were you aware of his treatment? Sometimes I feel like this whole illness thing is a deal between him and Cristi. How so? He only talks to Cristi about it. I have to pry the words out of his mouth, pretend I don't see the symptoms... Obviously, we're not allowed to bring it up with Ana. If I try to talk to him, his ego takes a blow. Ever since Ana got pregnant... Anton has been treating her like a porcelain egg. Ana is very discreet about it. First trimester... You get a bit nervous. -Do calm down. -Anyway... No point getting into all this. That's all I have to say anyway. If you think that's why Anton is with me... I never said that, please don't take it that way. And anyway, this illness thing appeared long after we had met. By the way, when did you meet? Thank you. I'm not very proud of that story. But I don't want you hearing it from someone else. What story? When we first met, I was with a friend of his. His best friend. Radu tried not to miss any of Anton's concerts in town. But quite often, business kept him away. Usually I found someone to go with, but twice I went alone. Anton drove me home and the inevitable occurred. Well, Radu was always busy with business, with his daughter. -When did you tell him? -Shortly after. It was pointless to hide it. We chose to tell him, I owed it to him, even if it hurt. -Did they have a conflict? -No. They discussed and buried the story. Neither of us has talked to Radu since. -Radu who? -Dogaru. -Hello? -Hello. Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. -Good evening. -Could I talk to the lady, please? Ana is devastated. Please. I don't enjoy calling this late either. It's the Commissioner. -Yes. -Good evening. I asked you for a list of people close to Anton. You mentioned nothing of Radu Dogaru. They haven't spoken in years. Exactly! Don't you find it important that they fell out after being so close? That's history. You asked about current contacts. What do you want from me? I have no strength left for your nonsense. Please, find Anton! Damn. How are you? I actually thought of calling you. I've had a hectic day. Whatever, it doesn't matter. I wanted to check on your mother. She's better, back on her feet. She gets discharged tomorrow, she'll stay with me for a while. Very good. Listen, she asked me about you. With her condition, I haven't told her about us. She was surprised you haven't come to see her. -What do you want me to do, Diana? -Nothing. You asked, I answered. You'll make up something. You're good at it. You could introduce her to your precious. I see. Thanks for your concern. Good night to you too! Shit! -Are you going out? -Yes. Chief, check this! When did Ms. Hot Stuff say she last talked to Anton? Nora? Tuesday, I think. Look: last call, Thursday, 12:37. So she lied. -Shall I call her? -No, I will. Look up Radu Dogaru. He owns a pharmaceutics warehouse. -Who's the dude? -I'll tell you later. Are you going alone, want someone with you? -Go home. -No. If I go home I'll go up the wall. Paul! Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -I need to see your boss. -Which boss? Radu Dogaru. One moment. Wait there, please. -Yes. -Hello. Commissioner Mihnea Nicoară, Precinct 4. -Another tax inspection? -I'm not with the Economic Crime branch. -Well, then? -This is about Anton Ropot. You know he's disappeared? Yes. But to me, Anton disappeared many years ago. -Still, we need to talk. -I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. Codruț! Get my jacket from the office, please. It's your guys' fault. I have a truck stuck in customs. I can come tomorrow to... your precinct, or office, whatever. At 8:00 AM would be fine. OK. I'm afraid you can't stay here. -Please do come. -I will. Precinct 4. Yes. Paul! Please move it out of the way. ...proposing to Shinzō Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, the signing of an "unconditional" peace treaty by the end of the year. So far, this has been prevented by the Kuril Islands dispute, sparked by Russia occupying the archipelago at the end of WWII. Japan has always claimed that territory. Florin? On what street had Ropot that road rage incident? So I recall. And you found out the date? Alright. You've changed your mind. It happens. I'm just going to Customs, don't give me that look. I should be back by midnight. May I come in? I'll keep it short. Why am I not surprised? The quicker you answer, the quicker we finish. What is your relationship with Anton Ropot? Since you're here, I guess you already know. We grew up together, on the same street. When did you last see him? About three years ago. How so? We had some issues. -Can you be more specific? -No, don't have to. It's an old story without any relevance. I'll be the judge of that. It was... a men's quarrel. I'll ask again. When did you last see him? Three years ago. You know why you're out of luck? Because I don't believe in coincidences. Such as Anton being seen in this building only four months ago. He argued over a parking spot with a neighbour of yours. A minor incident, but the guy remembered. It goes to show even scandals can be useful. I didn't want to get into this... Anton came to tell me he has cancer and hasn't got much time left. He wanted to apologize for... Well, that thing in the past. So he could go in peace. That's why you've been so "honest" with me. No, man, I just don't enjoy remembering that. But you enjoy taking me for an idiot! Not telling me that the guy who stole your woman came, after three years, to say sorry! Now listen here! -Leave Nora out of this! -This what? Tell me! Allesia? She's growing up. Her mother was right, I wouldn't have made a good godfather. Yeah, so it seems. Radu, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Listen, I won't take anything with me where I go. I'd like you to keep this for Allesia, when she grows up and makes a career choice. To make sure her dreams come true. I mean it. Get lost! May I smoke? No. She doesn't want to adopt. This need to give life is eating at her. There are alternatives. She's considered a bank, but doesn't want to hurt Cristi. She keeps it bottled up, while he's fucking up her life. It's not like I can help. Yes you can. And I wouldn't ask this of anyone else. What do you want, a helping dick? Yes. -Yes, you want a helping dick? -Yes, man. Why would your sister want to fuck me? She wouldn't. She won't know it's you. What are you cooking up? Just say you'll do it. I'll take care of the rest. I'll find out her fertile days, invite her to meet me somewhere isolated-- Hey! Are you off your rocker? You really think I'd... You think I'd force myself on a woman? You know what they call that? Rape. -Repeat after me: rape! -It's not rape. -Not if it's you. -What, then? It's not rape, you'd be helping her. You know I wouldn't ask this if it wasn't Ana's only chance. Any evidence for that? I was afraid he'd turn to someone else, so I told his sister. Listen here, if you call her, I'll know. I'll have you arrested for obstruction of justice. -Good evening. -Good evening. Anything wrong? I would like a word with your wife. Ana! -Yes! Have you found anything? -Good evening. When and why did you last talk to Radu Dogaru before your brother went missing? -Won't you come in? -No need. I don't know who told you what, but... Please answer with yes or no. Did you know there was a plot for you to be sexually abused? They had a stupid talk a few months back. Anton said stuff, Radu probably embellished... You think it's that trivial? I asked about Dogaru, you said they hadn't spoken in years. I didn't see the point, it was all nonsense. Are you sure it was just talk? Well, what do you think? Especially now that things have worked out. How far along are you? Two and a half months. And you're the "happy father"? -What do you mean? -What are you implying? -I'll report you for abuse. -Cristi, wait. I don't get it. You knew about the plan, yet you didn't even admonish your brother? This is family business. You're fishing for a scandal to get media attention? Instead of trying to find him? I thought you were looking for him. What is it? I can't find my keys. What? Come on in. I couldn't see anything. The bastard had his face covered with something. Just a second. Easy. Lie down. Easy. You want some water? Come with me, please. Only her. Hello. Have you been fingerprinted? -Me? -Yes. -No, why? -It's procedure. -Hello! -Is there a problem? We'll do it after. Am I a suspect? Come in, take a seat. -What is this? -We'll talk to you both. Do you mind? I don't see how it would help. Sit down. Close that door! We need you to clear up a situation that may be relevant. -Relevant for? -Patience. You said Anton Ropot visited you in January? To what end? He came to tell me he was terminally ill. Yes, go on. And that Ana was devastated because she couldn't get pregnant. -He wanted me to help them. -How? I told you before. Do repeat. By a relationship with his sister? Not exactly a relationship. I don't think Ana wanted to cheat on Cristi. So, then? -An assault. -A what? -Rape. -Very good, go on. Then I went and told Ana. When did he tell you? I told you before. That's all right. How did you react? What happened next? Please tell him, can't you see what he's implying? -Tell him! -Tell him what? -If you don't, I will! -Say whatever you want. Ana knew about his condition. Seeing how far he was willing to go, she wanted to help the lunatic die happy. -He's my brother, you bastard. -Oh, I'm the bastard? For letting you drag me into your mayhem. Tell them! Tell them how you planned it from A to Z! Sure, I'm the bastard in this masquerade! -He does the talk, I do the fucking! -Hey! Language! -You're talking nonsense. -Nonsense? You tell them how and why it happened. So the "god" could happily get away with fucking up our lives again! With cheating, rape, his stupid plan! You know what? I won't give him this satisfaction, too. What do you mean? Radu, come on. Please! Sorry. -You forgot this. -What's this? Order returned to sender. Didn't I tell you this is the money for the kid? My daughter doesn't need your stinking money! And there's no other kid, Ana is not pregnant. What? I didn't touch her, you jerk! How the fuck did you think I could do that? How? You're lying. It was Ana's idea. She knows you don't have long. I don't believe you. She wanted you to go in peace. To croak happy, knowing your stupid plan worked! I wonder what you'll tell them at heaven's door. You're shitting me, right? Tell me you are! Tell me you're shitting me, please! You're shitting me, right? Please tell me you're shitting me! -Hello, Nora. -Tell the woman all about it. -Afraid I'll tell on you? -Me, afraid of you? Then, what do you want, man? I don't want anything. We're done. I don't get it. I saw it myself. You saw what you wanted to see. -I don't believe you! -And what she wanted you to see. I don't believe you! -Let's call her, then. -Don't you dare! Cool it, man. Fine, we don't call her. You'll have your way. Just the way she's spoiled you. You two are really alike. She only thinks of you. And you only think of yourself, too. I can't believe you told him. I think I'm going nuts, too. So you're not pregnant? Let's say Anton bought it from the start. Was he thinking you'd be happy with a rape pregnancy? He knew I wouldn't... end it. How did it go with your brother after that? You'd see each other, talk like nothing had happened? I asked you something. Was it as if nothing had happened? I told him I didn't want to talk about that night. Who else knew about this? Your husband? Cristi understood the situation. Who else knew? How long were you planning on lying? And after nine months, what? Would you have purchased a baby? -Anton was doing badly. -When? Before or after you left his place? Good Lord, I didn't touch him! I swear! When did you grow a conscience? Almost two weeks ago. On Thursday. Come on, it was in broad daylight, people would have seen me. What would I have done with him? And why, after all this time? You tell us. What time did you visit him? Around noon. And when did you stop by? Around 9:00, before work. Did Anton call you after 12 o'clock? -No. -The record confirms it. So you were the last person to see him. If Nora heard you on-- I told you Eleonora has nothing to do with it. -I told her it was business talk. -I thought you weren't speaking anymore. Indeed. You're really mocking us. Taking us all for complete idiots. Getting us to buy your crazy story! You haven't seen him in three years - except on the day he disappeared. You lost touch with him - except that one small attempted rape. You spoke with Eleonora, except you didn't. You must have recurring memory lapses. We can provide food and shelter for free, to help you clear your thoughts. If the Prosecutor here agrees, we'll give you the best conditions for meditation. You can expect surprises, too. Hold on, how far are you going to keep up this madness? Ana, you know me, I wouldn't have hurt Anton! Follow me, please. What the fuck do you think I could have done to him? These two are crazy as fuck and you're taking me in? I'm getting locked up for them? Go look for him in the loony bin! You will keep looking for him, right? Did I say I was done? You want us to find your brother? Cooperate. You've been hiding a lot from us. You didn't need to know that. What did we need to know? Get yourself together. I'll be waiting for you at 3:00 o'clock. With answers. Rise and shine. I don't even remember when I fell asleep. Have we passed it? Yes, but I didn't have the heart to wake you up. We'll stop there on the way back. My idea exactly. They won't mind. Won't the flowers wither? I'll just pick some more. Mum loved wild flowers so much! Hopefully the traffic will be light. It's Thursday, Ana. Who will drive up here on a Thursday? Besides, it's so secluded. Remember how hard Dad had to look for it? Yes. Aren't you having any? No. No more... coffee or alcohol for me. David. -What? -I like "David". Yeah? There's been plenty of Davids lately. Precisely. It's trendy. And if it's a girl -Maria? Or Sofia? You got it. I like Eva. Or Sara. Or Iudit. It's definitely a girl. Girls are more affectionate. And quick-minded. The flowers. I don't want them to wilt. Let's stay a bit more. Or Raisa. Rebeca?
