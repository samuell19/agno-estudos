Please move back. Please move back, sir. Sir, please. Sir, move back. Well, welcome to Chicago. First time here? Yes. Yes, it is. So, what made you come here from Seattle? How do you know I'm from Seattle? I can read. My husband, he grew up here. Yeah? He a native? Yeah. Born and raised. Ah, my ex, she wanted me to leave for Miami. I wouldn't have it. No way was I loosing my home court advantage. Well, if you loved her you would've moved. If she had loved me, she would've stayed. All right, let's see. That's gonna be 50 bucks. I should've charged you 65, but seeing as you're new in town... Well, I thought the flat rate from the airport was 35? Hmm. Right there. You're not the only one who can read. You're gonna do all right here, lady. Hey, sexy. - Hi. - Hi. God! I'd forgotten how good you look. It seems like it's been years. Oh, it's only been two weeks. You know me. When it comes to you, I'm in dog years. I missed you. You're gonna love it here, Paige. I promise. Come on. You think I brought enough stuff? I was expecting more. Here, let me get the small ones. I'm okay. Honey, what's in here? The old apartment. Oh. Wait a second. - Close you eyes. - Why? Just close your eyes. Now, open them. This place is amazing! I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It beats the hell out of that one bedroom rat hole in Seattle, huh? Hey, I liked our rat hole. It had charm. Oh, come on. Not like this place though, huh? How did you find this place? This was the place I told you about. This was the last one I looked at. I still can't believe that nobody snatched it up. Oh, before I forget, hon, the movers are coming here tomorrow at 9:00, and unfortunately I can't be here. They got me coming in for this 8:30 meeting, so... I'll be fine. That was pretty easy. I keep expecting to wake up any second and just realize that this is all a dream. Getting paid to design sky scrapers... I mean, who would have thought? I knew you could do it. God. I am so proud of you. I bet... you're dying to see the bedroom. Bedroom now. Welcome to the nest. Oh! Oh, Mark, I love it. You sure about that? I'm positive. I just want to make sure everything is absolutely perfect for you. It is. You'd let me know if it wasn't, right? It's perfect. Mark? Huh? What's wrong? I heard something. I think someone's in the living room. Wait here. Wait. Wait! Could we just... - Do you think that's safe? - Ssh. Stay there. Mark? Mark? He got away, hon. But he told me to give you this. Jerk. It wasn't funny. No! Get away from me. Come here. You weren't really worried about me, were you? Yes! Of course I was. I'm sorry. You care. You really care. I was scared. Oh. Please put it over here. Oh, no, no, no. Turn it. Wait. Could you hold the door? Thanks. Here we are. Good. Thanks. - Oh. Gosh. - Oh. No, I got it. I got it. Can you hit six? You're in 511, aren't you? Yeah. Just moving in. Yeah, I noticed. - I'm Milton. - Paige. Hey. So, uh, how long you've been married? Excuse me? Right. Right. It's six months. Ah. Newly weds, huh? So, what, you knew your husband long before you tied the knot? Huh? Oh. Ah, excuse me, uh... I just tend to, uh, be a little nosy when a pretty girl moves into the building. Especially when it reminds me of my daughter. - Oh, you have a daughter? - Yeah. Yeah. Ah, here we are. You know, actually we've only known each other nine months. Love at first sight, huh? Yeah, something like that. Look, if you need anything, you know, anything at all, I'm just upstairs at 611. Oh. So, you're right above us? Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Okay. Well, it's nice meeting you. Yeah, yeah. Take care. - Hello? - Hey, Paige. Just calling to let you know I'm running late tonight. Oh. Is, is everything okay? Oh, yeah. Everything's fine. Just paying my dues. Hmm. Okay. I love you. I love you more. Oh, you got that? Do you need a hand? Oh, I think I got it. Thanks. I'm Scott. I'm right here. Paige. I'd shake your hand, but... No, no. Look, I understand, I went... through the same thing couple of months ago myself. Are you, uh, alone or... - Married. - Oh, cool. All right. You know, actually, do you think you could get the door for me? Oh. Sure. There you go. - Thank you. - Any time. So, get this, after the meeting, he pulls me aside and tells me that in another year or two, I can head the golden commission. That represents, like, 20% of the sky scrapers in this city. They're just gonna let me step into it, just like that. That sounds like you're impressing the right people. I guess so. I don't want to sound ungrateful, but... I feel like I don't deserve it. Some people have worked their whole lives for something like this, and they don't even come close to it. You're gifted, Mark. Accept it. You're not having any regrets, are you, about moving here? Mm-mmm. Absolutely not. I just want to know, because you came so close to making junior partner, I... It's no big deal. I know how hard you worked, Paige, and... and to pull up stakes to come out here with me... It's fine. Look, what's done is done. So, let's just enjoy this, okay? Because this is so exciting for us. I mean, it's, like, a once in a lifetime opportunity. I just want to make sure you're happy. That's all. I am happy. To Chicago? Mm-hmm. To Chicago. Oh. Hi. I'm your new neighbor. Leave a message. Hi, you've reached the Emersons. Leave us a message and we'll call you back. Fine. Don't leave a message. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah, I'm looking for Mark Emerson. Who's this? Let me start over. This is Hugh, Mark's father. Oh, my God. Hugh, hi. It's Paige. Oh, I'm sorry I missed the wedding. Did you get my card? Yeah. I did. It was, um, very nice. Thank you. It sounds like my son's a very lucky man. How's he doing? Really good. He just, uh, he got a job at an architectural firm. He's so excited. Well, we're both very excited. It's been crazy. Yeah, he told me about that a few weeks ago. It's fantastic. Paige, would you mind, uh, giving him a message for me? Sure. Hold on, just let me get something to write it on. Hello? Oh, are you on a cell? It's a really bad connection. Hello? Okay, call me back. Hello, I'm Irene. Paige. It's nice to finally meet you. Okay. Well, I'll see you around. I wouldn't unpack those boxes if I were you. What do you mean? Your apartment's cursed. What do you mean? Last year a man and his girlfriend died in their own bed. They were punished. Someone died in our apartment? You have your fire escape blocked. Don't you think it's kind of dangerous? I wouldn't use it anyway. I'm terrified of heights. Then why do you live on the fifth floor? It reminds me of my mortality. Excuse the mess, I... I don't get much company. Where was I? You said that someone died in our apartment. Oh, yes. It was rumored he was connected to the mafia. Everyone thought he or his girlfriend had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette, but I know what really happened. They punished him. "They"? The bad people. They were with him the night they died. I heard their voices so angry, so full of hate. He was punished for his sins. They'll punish you, too. For what? How well do you know your husband? What do you mean? Has he ever done anything criminal? No. No, my husbands not a criminal. If you're pure, you have nothing to worry about. But if you're hiding something... Beware! Right. Okay. Um, you know, I have to go. You haven't heard the noises at night? You haven't felt them watching? You learn something new everyday, huh? This is nice. Father-daughter shootout. My dad likes skeet shooting, what can I say? Okay. Something on your mind? Okay, first of all... there's our neighbor, Irene... She says our apartment is cursed. "Cursed"? That's what she said. She said that someone died in here. Well... somebody dying in our apartment is pretty creepy, but totally possible. And we're in a big city. It has a history. People die. She said, like, murdered. These bad people punished some guy in here. Hmm. Sounds exciting. You're not some sort of serial killer, are you? No, just a few hitchhikers here and there. I wouldn't go so far as to say serial, like... Ha. See? I knew you had a secret. Come on, sweetheart. You don't really have a problem with this, do you? Not really. But the other day, I heard weird noises in the wall. That wall, that we share with Irene. Maybe it was her television. Right. That's what I thought. But Irene doesn't have a TV. She doesn't even have a radio. Ah... Well, it can only mean one thing. - What? - She's right. Our apartment's cursed. What? Come on. - Right here? - Yeah. I don't hear anything, sweetheart. It could be the plumbing, or the wiring or something, but you let me know if you hear it again, all right? Yeah. You said there was something else? Today when I got out of the shower there was this, this man staring at me. What? That maintenance man. He was right outside our bedroom window. He was watching you? Well, he was... he was outside... Yeah, I mean, he was outside the bedroom window in one of those cherry picker things, and I was on the phone, in my towel and this man is staring at me. You know, I'm gonna call the super and complain about this. No wonder you've been so jumpy. Is there more? Your father called today. That's the first time I ever spoke to him. He seems like a nice enough guy. Really? What'd he say? Not much. He had a message for you, but the phones cut out, and I think he was on a cell and he didn't call back. You ever gonna talk about him? I talk about him. No, you don't. Look. You know all you need to know about him. He was an undercover cop, he retired, and now he just does his own thing. He wasn't the most open man in the world. It's part of the lifestyle. Yeah. But, I mean, maybe if you talk to him now... Sweetheart, I wouldn't know where to begin. It's not like we were that close, and quite frankly, I don't care. He seemed really interested in you today. Well... I'm sorry, I didn't... I don't meant to upset you. I'm not upset, all right? I'm just gonna go in the other room and finish up some work. You need me out here, or are you fine? No. No, I can handle it. All right. I'll go call the super. Hello? Hello? Excuse me. What happened? Lady had an accident. Fell off the fire escape. Excuse me. People, please stay back. Do not cross this line. Thank you. Please stay back. Okay, call me at the police station. - Anything else? - Paige. Are you the next door neighbor? Thanks. Yes. We just moved in. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Uh, no, not at all. Did she seem depressed in anyway, or suicidal? No. A little eccentric maybe, but not suicidal. Um... the officer downstairs said that she had an accident watering her plants? Yeah. That's what it looks like. That's not possible. I went to visit her yesterday and she had this huge armoire blocking the fire escape, and she said that she was afraid of heights. She never went out there. Are you sure about that? Yeah. I'm positive. Would you mind coming with me for a minute, please? No, see... See that armoire was here and... Paige? How're you doing, Paige? Uh... Want to talk? She didn't seem like somebody who would kill herself. Well, most likely she just lost her balance and fell. Or maybe she had a heart attack, who knows? What about the plants? That I can't answer. But, uh, I know that Irene has been a little unpredictable over the last few years. May God bless her. We all loved her, but... she was loosing it. Really? Well, you met her. She asked me if Mark did anything criminal. She actually said that? - Yeah. - God. She also told me that the apartment was cursed. That it punished people. That sounds crazy, right? The apartment punishes people? I mean, you're right, it does sound crazy. She also told me that the guy who lived there before us burned to death in his bed. Paige, I've been here for 20 years, I don't know anything about that. It sure sounds like something Irene would say. What do you mean? Well, a few years ago she tried to convince me that this apartment was haunted by the ghost of a serial killer. I mean, I couldn't sleep for weeks. She told you that? Yeah. I mean, ask anyone in the building, they all know an Irene story. Hey. - Late again, huh? - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. The firm's really cracking whip. Oh. I called you at 6:00, but they said you had already had left. Really? Oh, we have a new receptionist, so maybe she got our lines crossed. I got your message about the lady next door. It's really awful. I tried to get off work earlier to be here, but I couldn't. You all right? Okay. The police said that she had an accident watering her plants, but she did not have any plants. And she had this huge armoire that was completely blocking the fire escape. She said she was afraid of heights. She said she hadn't been out there in years. Are you sure there were plants before? Maybe you missed them. No, I'm positive. Now, what? You don't believe me? I didn't say that. Then why are you looking at me like that? Paige, you're under a lot of pressure right now. You're in a new city, you're trying to adjust. That's a lot of stress for anyone. What, you think I'm losing my mind? No. I know exactly what I saw. - Where are you going? - I'm going for a walk. Paige, come on. Oh. Hey, Paige. Scott. Oh! I thought you were home, I could hear voices. Oh. Ah, no, I leave my TV on. I just hate coming home to... a silent apartment. So, what's up? Ah, it's just... You wouldn't happen to know who was in our apartment before us? No. Why? Just curious. Milton might know. I mean, I've only been here for couple of months, but he's been here forever. Yeah. Right. Okay. All right, thanks. Is there anything else I could do? No. No. Uh, I have to go. Okay, bye. So, Irene was right about Martel... and you told me that you didn't know anything about it. Why would you lie to me? It's something that most of us would rather forget. I don't understand. Paige... It's just not something you want getting around. And you just moved into the building, I didn't want you getting all weird about the apartment. I'm sorry. I mean... You mad at me? No. Oh, I'm just... I'm so confused. About? Irene said that she heard voices the night that Martel had his accident. Well, I'm sure that Irene heard a lot of voices in her day. Oh, come on, Paige, you're not gonna go there. I mean, this "cursed apartment" thing? Can I help you? Oh. I was, uh... You're the neighbor from next door, right? You're not supposed to be here. I'm leaving. How did you get my address? Well, I told you I, I looked it up. You can find just about anything online these days. I don't know anything more about my brother and his girlfriend. I already told the police everything there is to say. Oh, Mrs. Martel, I'm not the police. No? Then who are you? I'm living in his apartment now. I just... I want to know what happened. They called it an accident. Bruce didn't have an accident. He had enemies. So, you think that someone killed him? Most definitely. Who? Bruce told me... that he felt like people were watching him. He was paranoid. Was almost as if... As if the place was making him insane. Do you understand? They said that my brother burned in his bed from a lit cigarette. That was no accident. How do you know? Because Bruce didn't smoke. And neither did his girlfriend. So tonight you're going to meet the man himself. Mansfield can be a little intimidating, but... I think you'll like him. Earth to Paige. I did some checking up today on what Irene said about the guy who burned to death in our apartment. She was right. Why're you so obsessed with this? Because it's just not adding up. Everything doesn't have to add up, Paige. Life is like that. Yeah, right. But don't you think it's kind of strange that right after she tells me this, she has an accident, and falls off her fire escape? Maybe it was a coincidence. And maybe it was a coincidence that Martel fell asleep with a lit cigarette, and the man didn't even smoke. How do you know he didn't smoke? Because I, I spoke with his sister today. You spoke to his sister today? Uh-huh. You see, that is what makes you an amazing lawyer. And you're gonna make junior partner in record time. You just latch onto something like a pit bull and you don't let go, ever. That's what I love about you. Mark, I'm serious. I know you are. But if you go out looking for a problem, you're gonna find one, whether it's there or not. Now, come on, let's go have some fun. So, how are you settling in, Mark? It's been hectic, but now that Paige is here to help out, it's fine. You should be proud of your husband. Oh, I am. I brag about him every chance I get. He's gonna go far in this firm. It's not everyday you find a man with his kind of focus, his kind of work ethic. Well, thank you very much, sir. When can we see the revised plans? Monday morning at the latest. I've also got some new ideas I'd like to run past you. You know, it was like when we had our first child. I mean, all our energy was there in one place, but she did it. She passed the bar first try. Oh, congratulations. I'm so happy for you. I was lucky in few questions. And I had Jim's help. Come on, honey, you were in the zone. It was all you. Jim, you're embarrassing me. What? I can brag a little, can't I? Paige, what do you do? I'm a criminal lawyer. I'm just getting settled in right now, but I'll look for something in the spring. Hmm. Better not wait too long. You might lose your edge. Personally I want to know how he stepped over Anthony for that job. I mean, Anthony has been working his butt off for the last eight months. It's obvious someone pulled strings. I mean, Mark may be good, but there's no way he's that good. Any idea what she does? His wife. Well, I heard she's a lawyer. But she sounds more like a Stepford wife to me. I mean, she left a promising career to move here with Mark. Now, she has to start all over again. Herrgott. You look amazing. Thank you. You are thousand miles away, sweetheart, what's wrong? I just overheard some of the other wives at the party, in the bathroom, talking about us. Oh, yeah? What'd they say? They said that someone pulled strings to get you your job. Right. Well, they're just jealous. You have to tune that stuff out. Hmm. Unless of course you believe them. Um... all right. Maybe I pulled some strings on my grades, too, huh? Or maybe I bribed someone to get on the top five percent of my class? And all those evenings you saw me studying, I guess they just never happened, huh? Wasn't it you who said I of all people deserved it? I'm not questioning you. Well, you did. Look, I'm not gonna pretend that I'm not amazed that I got this job. Because I am. Believe me. I just find it a little ironic that they said that considering all the other junior partners, every single one of them, the only reason they got through the front door is because of their families. I didn't exactly grow up in a life of comfort. Everything I got, I got it on my own. My mom died when I was a kid and... my dad was a cop. So, there's not a lot of good he's gonna do in a situation like that. Is that why you're not close? We're not close because he doesn't care. When he was around, my mom and I were like furniture to him. The only thing he cared about was his job. I just find it funny that he's changed his tune now that he needs me. Why? How does he need you? You know something... I don't want to talk about him. - Why not? - Because I don't. Can you respect that? Fine. Whatever. What's with all the questions lately? I'm curious. No, it's more than that. Ever since you came here, you've... Yeah? You've been acting a little paranoid. Every little thing means something. Are you not happy here? Why would you say that? If you're uncomfortable, moving here to be with me, then just come right out and say it, all right? These games, Paige, it's not you, it's not the person I married. Yeah, well, if my gut is telling me something, then I'm gonna listen to it. It's who I am. What about your heart? Are you gonna listen to that, too? Hi, you've reached the Emersons. Leave us a message and we'll call you back. Oh, God. - Hello? - Hello, Paige. Hugh! Hey, why don't you ever leave messages? Why do you let your machine answer when you're there? I'm sorry we got cut off the other day. Oh, it's... I understand. Listen, you want me to give you Mark's number at work and you can call him there? I'm calling because, uh, I'm coming to town in a few days. I hope we could get together. Oh! Oh, that's great. Oh, it will be so nice to finally meet you. I want this to be low key. I don't want Mark to make a big deal about this. Yeah. But, I mean, it is a big deal. Hello? Paige, I'm really busy right now. I thought you would wanna know that your father called again. You still there? Yeah, I'm still here. What did he say? Well, he said that he is coming to town in a couple of days, and he wants to get together. He actually said that? Yeah. Why? Is there something wrong with that? Oh, God, I thought you were gonna be happy about this. You know, I called you as soon as I found out. Look, can we talk about this when I get home? Is something wrong? There's nothing wrong. Then why are you acting so weird about this? Look, Paige, I'm at work and I'm really busy, all right? I'll call you later. That'll be $15.60. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Lady? Lady, you're getting out or what? No. Can you just keep driving? It feels so weird telling you all this. It's just that I don't know anybody in this city. Are you kidding? It's, it's an honor. My daughter went through the same thing about two years ago and... she never talked to me about it. What happened? Oh, it turns out it was just a misunderstanding. Maybe it was one of his colleagues. Yeah. Well, I don't know, I saw her the other day. I was in this cafe, and she was watching me. Sometimes everything isn't what it seems to be, and I'd hear Mark's side of the story before I jump to any conclusions. He's just gonna lie. Like he lied about his dad. Why did he do that? If what you told me is true, it's not exactly something you brag about. He told me he retired. You know, I thought that they just had a strained relationship. I never would've thought his dad would actually... Well, I'm sure Mark had a good reason. I mean... Maybe he was ashamed, Paige, or... Or maybe he was just trying to protect you. No wonder he freaked out when he called. I can't even imagine what Mark must be feeling. Oh, God. You don't think that he could be helping his dad? Oh, God. Stay away from me! Get off of me. Help! Help me! Paige? Paige? Oh, my God, I heard you scream. Are you okay? Oh. Look. - Why? - Come on. Come. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. Do you have any idea what he was after? Mrs. Emerson? No. I... He just... He was just in the bedroom. She said she saw the same guy looking in our window a few days ago. Is this true? Yeah. I got out of the shower and I caught him looking in at me. Have you noticed anything else unusual since you moved here? Detective, we just moved in, and we are under tremendous amount of stress here. All right. We can finish this later. Give me a call if you notice anything else. I will. Thank you. Thank you. You feeling any better? He could've killed me. I'm just thankful you're safe. Should I get someone for you to talk to about this? I don't need a shrink, Mark. Okay. Is there anything I can do? Don't. Did I do something? Why don't you tell me? What is that supposed to mean? Who is she, Mark? - Who? - I went by your office today. Who is she? Nobody. She... She's nobody. I don't think you argue like that with nobody. Paige. And I saw her at the cafe. She was watching me. Paige, this is not what you think it is. Yeah, right. I'm leaving, Mark. I'm going back to Seattle. You're going back to Seattle because I was talking to a woman? There's a lot of things you're not telling me, Mark. What? Your father didn't retire. You lied. I can't tell you everything right now. I want to more than anything, but I can't. Why not? Because I can't. You're just gonna have to trust me. Well, until you start actually talking to me, Mark, that's impossible. I love you, Paige. You have to know that. And you have to know that I wouldn't do anything to hurt or betray you. That's enough. You... Just relax, okay? Nobody has to get hurt. Who are you? Why are you watching me? Put the baseball bat down. Stay away from me. Damned, Paige, why did you have to do that? - Milton? - You jeopardized my entire operation today. You almost killed one of my best cops yesterday. I got to hand it to you, you're on a roll. Cops? What are you talking about? Scott? How's the secondary mic? Ah, looks like she nailed that one, too. We could have it replaced in another hour or so. What the hell is going on here? They're undercover police officers. They work for me. Carrie, can you give Diego a hand? I'm on it. You are watching us? No, we got a live feed in every room. You see everything that we do in our apartment? It's not an apartment actually, it's a, uh... surveillance unit. We move suspects in. Let them get comfortable. We gather the evidence that we need. We have, uh, kind of a deal with the apartment management company, it gives us free reign. So everything you've done has been carefully monitored and recorded. Every sound... every gesture... every breath... Everything. Oh, my God. Why? Because, Paige... your husband's under surveillance. Because of his father? That's right. We think he's been helping Hugh. Hugh killed this undercover police office last year, 'cause he got too close to his operation. Operation? Yes. He's taking a cut on some illegal gambling here in the city. Supplementing his income, if you know what I mean. This poor cop cornered him, paid with his life. Hugh slit his throat with a buck knife. Quietly, efficiently... then he disappeared. And no one seen him since. Except maybe Mark. We think that Hugh has contacted Mark, maybe, dozen times over the past year. So we backed off, and, uh, made him think that we've just given up. Then we moved you into the fish bowl. You moved us here? How? Well, that was easy. We followed Mark, identified the realtor he was using. Chicago Police Force carry a lot of weight in this city. You know what I mean? Quite a great deal you got in that apartment, don't you think? So, when Hugh contacts Mark... we know it. When Mark makes a phone call, or visits a website... or talks to you in confidence about his father... we're on to it. What about Martel? Let's just say that situation got out of control. So you burned him in his bed? No. No. But we did set fire to the bed in order to cover our tracks. What about Irene? Oh, come on, Paige, we're police officers. We don't push little old ladies off balconies. So, why are you telling me all this? We need your cooperation. What do you want from me? We want you to pretend this never happened. When we're done here, you're going to go back to your apartment, we'll help you clean up the mess that you made, and then, when your husband gets home, you're gonna act like the good little wife. And you are not going to rock the boat. Are you kidding me? I can't just act like none of this happened. I suggest you try. Because I'm telling you right now, if Mark or anyone else gets wind of this, we're going to haul his ass off to prison for aiding and abetting his father. And as for you... Well, you're an accessory now. So, connect the dots. Any life you thought that you two might have together, well, that's gonna vanish... like that. How's this gonna go down, Paige? Huh? You decide. Hi. I'm so sorry. It's okay. You don't have to apologize. I don't blame you for being angry. I should've told you. I just was really upset last night and I wasn't thinking clearly. But, today I, um, I had some time, you know, to sit down and... really put things into perspective. So, you're not leaving? I can't leave. There's things that you're not willing to share with me, and that's, that's fine. I could learn to live with that. You mean that? A good relationship is built on trust, right? Listen, Paige, about my father... - No... - No, please. Let me say this. He wasn't exactly the best chapter in my life. I didn't tell you, because I was ashamed. I understand. When you told me he was coming here, I... I freaked out. I didn't want to bring you into all of this. Bring me into what exactly? My father could be a murderer. That woman you saw me arguing with, she's a cop, and she was asking questions. They know I've been in contact with him. Mark, I mean, if you know your dad killed somebody, why would you help him? Before he took off... he told me not to believe what they were saying about him. He said he was innocent. When they approached me in Seattle and told me what he had done, and all the evidence they had against him, it seemed like he was guilty, but... In my heart, I just... couldn't believe it. He's still my father. Did you paint this wall? Yeah. That is weird, I know. Um... I just couldn't stand looking at it anymore. Just kept reminding me of what happened. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. You have no idea. Mark. Mark. I, I can't right now. It's okay. It's okay. He called me at work today. Are you gonna see him? If it means getting him out of our lives, yeah. Give me the phone log from his office. Why can't I come with you? I told you, it's out of the question. Mark. I really, I want to be there for you. I know you do. But this is something I have to do myself. I'm not dragging you into this mess. Mark... Honey, please, it's hard enough as it is. Don't make it any more difficult. Okay. Thank you. Get out of here! What the hell are you doing? Get out of here! Just listen to me. We want you to follow Mark tonight. Get out of here. And then, we're gonna follow you. Do you understand that? You want me to follow my own husband? Well, if you want to keep him out of prison, yeah. And then what? And then you're going to introduce yourself to his father, and while they're distracted by your glowing personality, we're going to move in. Why can't you follow him yourselves? We need you to wear a wire, so we know when to make our move. And, Paige, don't even think about messing up tonight. Because if Hugh gets wind that something is wrong, he will kill you. He'll slit your throat without even thinking about it. So, just be cool. Because if you don't, he's gonna jump right back into hiding again. Do you understand that? Paige, do you understand that? Yeah. Good. Good. So, just do your job. Act as if nothing is wrong, and I'm sure everything is gonna work out for you and your husband. Oh, and, Paige, just try to relax, will you. Relax? Give me a break. We'll be watching you. Meter's ticking. I know. Let me guess. Follow that car. Could you? Been a long time since anybody told me to follow that car. Roll out. Hooking up with his favorite squeeze, huh? Can you just follow him? I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it. Men can be real stinkers sometimes, you know? Yeah. Here you go. Thanks. Thanks. Give him hell, lady. Looking for somebody? Excuse me. Hi. What the hell are you doing here? - I, um... - Did you follow me here? I really want to meet your dad. I thought we talked about this. But he's your father. You're leaving right now. I told you I wasn't going to bring you into this mess, and I meant it. - Come on. - Well, we're we going? - Home. - What about your dad? Another time. Not now. - He's leaving. - My, God, he's gonna blow everything. Mark, I'm not leaving. Paige, you have no idea what's going on here. - Then tell me. - I can't. Why not? You don't trust me? How am I supposed to trust you when you don't trust me. All right. - You want to know what I'm doing here? - Yes. I'm giving him money so he'll go away and leave us alone. Mark. I know that he's your dad, but you could be helping a murderer. If I thought he was guilty, you think I'd be here? But how do you know? I don't. Mark, please, let's just get out of here. She's turned on us. She's helping Mark. Can we please just get out of here? Do you want me to move in? Let's just go. Mark. I'm sorry I'm late, but traffic was nuts. You must be Paige. You are much prettier than you are on the phone. Oh. I brought this for Mark, but, since you are here... Ah, it's a little late, but, uh, wedding gift. Thank you. Uh, why don't we go and sit down? Yeah, why not. You all right? Just say the word, I'll move in. Just give them a chance to settle in. You seem awful tensed tonight, Mark. I wonder why. You know, it's a real surprise to see you, Paige. I really didn't expect to see you tonight. I had to meet my husband's father. I mean, he talks so much about you. I can only imagine what he had to say. So, tell me, uh... what did you do before my son ripped you out of Seattle? This isn't the right place, or the right time. Why not? I'm her father-in-law, I have rights. I'm currently an out of work attorney. Oh, so, you left your job for my son, did you? No. It was my decision to come. You're awfully quiet tonight, Mark. I guess I have a lot of things on my mind. Why? Things are going great for you. You got a great job. You have a beautiful wife. You've come a long way. I'm proud of you, son. Paige knows, Dad. So, can we just get this over with? Hmm. I see, you're still mad because I missed the wedding. It's got nothing to do with the wedding, and you know it. Look, just take this... and go away. I believe you, Dad. I do. That's why I'm helping you out right now. But this is where it ends. Mark. Just a second. I refuse to bring her into this, do you understand that? Where you going? The ladies' room. I'll be right back. Okay, let's wrap this up. What's going on, Paige? Huh? Who's waiting for me? He knows. Paige, who is outside waiting for me? - No one. - You're lying, Paige. - I... I'm not lying. - Yes, you are. You're lying to me. Please don't hurt me. Then you better talk fast. What's this? All right, go. This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna walk out of here, Paige. If you scream... I'm gonna have to kill you. Do you understand me? Okay. Let's go. Carrie, move in. He's going for the back door. Freeze! Drop your weapon. Drop it. Drop your weapon. Damn it! Scott, I need you in the alley. Hold on! Hold on! Back up, he's turned left. What are you gonna do with me? Are you gonna kill me? Of course not. Milton told me how you killed that undercover police officer. He said you slit his throat with that knife. It figures. Turn right here. Right. Okay, park here. Where are you going? So long. Wait. Just like that? Just like that. Yeah, well, if you leave, they're gonna put Mark in jail. I'm not letting Milton take me in. It would be the right thing to do. Oh. Is that what you think? Yeah. It's not our fault you killed that police officer. What are you talking about? I didn't kill anyone. Oh, come on. Why would Milton lie? Because he killed him. You didn't know, did you? Milton's dirty. Yeah, well, he says the same thing about you. So, tell me why, why should I believe you? Because if I wasn't telling the truth, you'd be dead now. So, when I threatened to blow the whistle on Milton's gambling operation, he killed my partner, pinned it on me. That's when you went into hiding? I had to. Spent the last year trying to piece enough evidence to take Milton down. And Marks' been helping you? They can track everything. I can't access my credit cards, or my accounts. Mark's been helping me out. Okay. So, what now? Well... right now Milton's holding all the cards. What if I went back there and tried to reason with him? I think you'd assume the worst. So, what are you saying, my life's over? I'm sorry. There might be a way. What are you doing? Ever used a gun before? Hello? Mark, meet me downstairs, now. Hurry. Paige, listen to me. There's something I have to tell you. Mark, just come outside. I'll be right out front. - Hurry. Come on, get in. - Paige, get out of here. - What? - They're here. Go. - No, wait. - Forget about me. Just get out of here, now. Get out of the car. Now. - She's clean. - Good. I want to speak to my lawyer. Yeah, yeah. After the interrogation. What the hell's going on here? I know my rights. They're dirty, Mark. You're right about your father, he's innocent. He didn't kill his partner, Milton did. Milton set him up. Let me guess who told you that. What would posses you to believe a murderer? A cop killer? You killed Irene too, huh? What? Was she jeopardizing your little stake out? Leave my wife alone! Leave her alone! Where is Hugh? I'm asking you, where is he hiding? I don't know. Bastard! No, no, no. It didn't have to happen this way. I want to know everything. I want to know what he said. I want to know where he's hiding. I want to know everything... No wait. He has a message for you. A message? He wants to make a deal. He said that he'll give himself in, in exchange of Mark's safety. No, he wouldn't. No, he knows you have Mark. He knows you hold all the cards. He's no threat to you. There's no way that he can prove that you murdered that police officer. It's your word against his. How can I be sure of it? Well, you've already pinned it on him. He'll take the fall for your crime in exchange for releasing us. It can't get much cleaner than that. Aside from trying to buy him off again. Look, I gave him an out, he didn't have to come after me. His partner would still be alive today if he'd just taken my deal. Hugh didn't pull the trigger, you did. Quit trying to blame everybody else for your actions. You don't get it. He cornered me. I had no choice. All right, where does he want to make the deal? Mark! Damn it, we need him alive. Hey! Get her. Come out, bitch! Don't come in here. I have a gun. You won't use it. You are not gonna kill me, Paige. You do not have what it takes. I'm coming in now, Paige. Don't! I gave him an out. He didn't have to come after me. His partner would still be alive today if he'd just taken my deal. Hugh didn't pull the trigger, you did. Quit trying to blame everybody else for your actions. You don't get it. He cornered me, I had no choice. Hugh? I still have your son. Remember what happened the last time you cornered me? Diego, I need you in here. So, I'm giving you till the count of three to get in here. Oh, and, uh... hands over your head. You might wanna hurry. Mark's leaking pretty badly. One... two... Close the door. Didn't have to go down like this. You could've taken my offer. You must've confused me with someone else. Indeed I must. Diego. I'm sorry, Mark. We tried to corner your father today, turned on his only son. He shot him. Mark? Okay. You're going to be okay. Do you hear me? No, no. No. No. Don't do that. I need an ambulance. - Mark? - My son's been shot. We're gonna get through this. Do you hear me? We're gonna get through this, okay? 1212 Somerset Avenue. Apartment 511. Mark. Thanks. Mark? Mark, hang in there, baby, okay? Mark, hang in there, baby. Do you hear me? Hold on. It's gonna be okay. How are you doing? I've been better. The doctor says he'll be up and out of the chair in two weeks. Good. Good. And, uh... how's the new place? It's not as big and twice as expensive. Well, I'm, uh... I'm glad you're staying in town. I read about you in the paper. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're trying to sort this mess out and, uh... But, hey, I'm back on the job. Congratulations. - That's great. - Mmm-hmm. Well, I think we got off on the wrong foot. So, why don't we all get together and go to dinner and do some catching up? Yeah, I'd love that. Okay. I'll see you around. Yeah. All right.
