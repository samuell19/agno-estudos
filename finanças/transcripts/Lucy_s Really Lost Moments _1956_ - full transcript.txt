The Chevrolet dealers all over America bring you direct from Hollywood: The Bob Hope Chevy Show With these stars as guests. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Vivian Vance. William Frawley. [ Applause ] Thank you very, very much. Well here I am. Back again. I'll wait while you pay off your bets. No, I want to tell you it's wonderful being back with you folks again after being away for so long. And I mean that. I feel it right here. Sort of empty. Any questions? No this is my second year for Chevrolet and I'm proud to say that Chevrolet is still number one in the field of low priced comedians. It's nice to be back. I guess I'm getting sentimental but I was touched by the wonderful reception I got when I arrived in NBC this afternoon. The officials formed 2 rows into the studio and I walked between while the team played hound dog. And of course this season is on Sunday nights. We finally got permission from Ed Sullivan. He owns Sunday you know. And tonight for the first time we're going to show you those beautiful brand new 1957 Chevrolets. And I know you are going to enjoy the opportunity to see in 56, the 57s you'll be paying for in 58. [ Applause ] If I can tell you... Me too. Oh this looks like a big year on T.V. Walter Winchell is on with a new show and it's very good. But one thing worries me: with Winchell busy on television and Ike out campaigning who's running the country? Of course Sid Ceasar is back with a new wife. He has a used wife lot you know? On his first show something went wrong with the picture and they didn't know what the trouble was until the found out the coaxial cable went through Nanette Fabray's backyard. I'll die with that joke. I love it. I want to tell you that. And Steve Allen took on so many shows he has no privacy at all anymore. He's on the air so much he has to raise his hand when he wants to leave the camera. And of course Perry Como is back. The old relaxisizer with legs. Oh I love the way Como works. He's so relaxed, every 10 minutes they put a mirror to his mouth to see if he is still breathing. And there is so much competition. The T.V. shows are still fighting it out Ed Sullivan has had some big shows, but next week he's going to top them all. He's going to start a brush fire on Alvin Presley's side burns. Oh, I love it. Alvin Presleys. I love that. To meet the competition, Steve Allen is having Anthony Eden doing a mambo with Nasser. And as an added attraction they're flying in the Suez canal I think. How about that Suez canal. I think Ike's going to do something about that. He's going to ask Stevenson to step in it. No, he's waiting for high tide but I want to say one thing. Boy they're really campaigning aren't they. And the things the candidates say about each other, why you'd think they were actors. I've never heard such words. Nixon says every family will have 2 cars, 3 tv sets, and only work 4 days a week. But Stevenson going him one better: he's trying to fix it so the replicans won't have to work at all. Now how about that? How about that? A four day week with 3 days off? Imagine 3 days of play time? Our next secretary of labor maybe Zsa Zsa Gabor. And of course Ike is going on T.V. a little more often then he thought he would. He had to do something. A lot of kids were beginning to think Walt Disney was president. Now he's been doing a lot of traveling too. When he was in San Francisco he stopped at the Saint Francis Hotel. And everybody was so thrilled that President Eisenhower was there but to show you how politics works, Ike suspected his hotel maid of being a democrat, because every time he came back to his room he found his bed short sheeted, a Stevenson button on his pajamas and a sign on his bathroom door reading: enlisted men only. And I thought it was nice when Grace and the Prince visited the white house the other day. They had a little trouble getting in lately Ike is suspicious of anyone coming in the white house with suitcases but they were real sweet. And the prince was a little surprised. He thought the capital was in Las Vegas. Oh, Grace wants to meet Stevenson too. They have a lot in common. They are both expecting. And I think... And I'm kind of thrilled because Desi and Lucy are paying me a great courtesy coming on my show. It's their first time on NBC. Actually this is a swap. I appeared on their first show and they're here to get revenge. You know I knew Lucy long before Desi in fact I've wondered if she'd married me instead of Desi. Let's see, huh? I know one thing: she wouldn't be doing those crazy things if I were her husband. [ Applause ] [ Phone ringing ] Hello. Hi Ethel, listen, I can't talk to you now. Ricky will be home any minute and I have a seal in the closet. Lucy what are you up to? Well I had a chance to get into show business and I took it. I'm an assistant in Captain Blythestone's trained seal act. I'll tell you all about it when you come home from the beach next week. We are back. I'm down at the corner delicatessen. We'll be home in 5 minutes. Oh but you can't come home. Captain Blythestone is sleeping in your bed. Captain Blythestone? What's a perfect stranger doing in our bed? Well, he isn't exactly perfect. He's got a broken leg. He slipped on a flounder I threw the seal. Listen, I gotta hang up now. Just a minute, just a minute Lucy. You've got a seal in the closet and Captain Blythestone is in our bed? Where are Fred and I going to sleep? Don't bother me with your problems. I got troubles of my own. What am I suppose to tell Fred? Don't tell him anything. Just come on up here and I'll think of something. -Okay. -Okay bye. [ Seal barking ] Alright baby! Mother's coming. [ Seal barking ] What do you got, a hollow flipper? Now don't eat too fast, I'm tired of burping you. Ricky! Baby! Oh, honey, I'm so glad you're home. I missed you terribly today darling. The house was so lonesome without you. You're the most wonderful husband in the whole world. Did you miss me today Ricky? See... Wait a minute, wait a minute, Lucy. What have you done? Who me? Yeah. The last time you kissed me like that you wrecked the car The insurance company canceled all my insurance on everything. And you did my laundry in the whirry mixer. What are you talking about? I give you a kiss everyday. I know, but this is October. You just kissed me all the way through Lincolns birthday. That's the way it is with you hot blooded latins. Yeah I guess so. You're too suspicious. Now I haven't done a thing. Close the door! I'm fumigating. We've got termites. Yeah, one of them must pitch for Cleveland. Well I have fan in there that circulates the fumes. See, we need an exterminator dear. Yeah, but why are you fumigating the place? That's the landloard's job. Well, Fred and Ethel are away. Just thought I'd help. Oh you're always helping. Like when we went on our honeymoon. You felt we'd be lonesome so you invited your mother to come along. Well I was just trying to help. Who were you helping? You're father?

While you're here don't you think you ought to give Ricky back his golf clubs and his tennis racket? After all he was nice enough to lone them to you. Big deal. I couldn't play. He didn't leave me any balls. That's very gay. You just returning from a wetback luau? They'll never let him in. -Hey, hi Ethel. -Hi. They're fumigating the closet you know. Yeah what is that... Don't worry about a thing. Say how come you came back so soon? I thought you were going to spend another week at the beach. Well we were but the grunyon stopped running so we didn't have anything to eat. No, the grunyon was not stopped running. I was just tired of finding a pelican for my breakfast everyday. You did what?

Yeah and it has to stay closed up till all the termites are gone. Well that's my wife. Well it could be worse. She could be my wife. Yeah... [ Knocking above ] Don't look now but I think one of your termites has got a wooden leg. What is that? -The building settling. -Settling? This building is 40 years old. I'm going to go upstairs. Oh no, now relax Fred. There might be a man upstairs! Oh don't be silly. If there was man up there I'd go up. Lucy, let's get some sleep. Maybe we're keeping our guests from leaving.

At the river lake country club for the United Cerebral Palsy Fund. I'll be back Sunday Novermber the 18th, the same time from New York with Perry Como. Goodnight folks. And lots of happy new years in your 57 Chevys. Thank you very much. The Bob Hope Chevy Show has been brought to you by your authorized Chevrolet dealer who invites you to see the all new 1957 Chevrolet now. This is the main studio of Desilu productions. Just behind this door, is the office of the president of Desilu Productions. And here seated at his desk we find the boss. Uh, correction. This is the boss' boss. The vice president of Desilu Productions. -Oh hi dear. -Hi honey. [ Knocks at desk ] Mind if I sit down? Oh, would you sit over there dear I'm busy. Just a minute... This is my desk. It says here, president. Well, if you want to get technical. Now will you sit over there? What are you doing that is so important. Well I'm making a list of the appliances I'll need for my new dressing room. Now look Lucy, I thought we discussed this at breakfast and decided to let these things go till later. Oh, I know we did dear. Well? Well that was at breakfast. It's now 3 hours later. You know at the rate you're going, it's going to cost more to fix your dressing room than it did to buy the whole studio. Oh come now. All I need is a few gadgets for the kitchen, a couple of things for the sitting room. and our sponsor seems to have the best line at the lowest prices. Where did you get this Westing-gouse catalog? Westing-gouse? Look it's not Westing-gouse. It's Westing-house. House! No, dear. Westing-gouse. Gouse! How do you pronounce W-E-S-T-I-N-G? -Westing. -Right. H-O-U-S-E? House. Fine now put them together. Westing-gouse. This is the first time two rights made a wrong. Look Lucy, it just so happens that I studied English grammar in Cuba. [ Claps ] No. Let 'splain something. 'Splain, 'splain. Please 'splain. When the G is followed by a H-O, like in G-H-O-S-T. Ghost. G-H-O. You say go! There is no H. Well if you keep calling it Westing-gouse there will be plenty of H. I am telling you it is pronounced Westing-gouse. I suppose the people who've been doing their T.V. commercials all these years have been wrong, huh? Well, in this particular case, I'm speaking better English than Betty Furness and John Cameron Swayze. How you ever got to be president I will never know. Nevermind that. Where did you get this? From Mr. Hayden, our Westing... our dealer in Beverly Hills. Then just give it back to him. Better yet, I'll give it back to him when he comes in. Oh, is Mr. Hayden coming here? -Yeah. -Oh! Desi! What's that for? You were going to older all those new appliances and surprise me. Look honey, I am taking Mr. Hayden on a tour of all the studios. And I'm going to tell him all about Westing-gouse Desilu Playhouse. So that he and all the fellas at Westing-gouse will know what we're going to do to help them sell the product. What kind of a surprise is that? I didn't say I was going to surprise you. Well, alright, when you and I take Mr. Hayden on a tour of our studios, I'll give him my order then. You know I do have a surprise for you. Really, what? You are not going on a tour of the studios. Why not? Because I told you will have to wait till later to get your Westing-gouse appliances. That's why not. Well couldn't I just tell him which ones I want and buy them later? Not gunna do it. I do not trust you. Some organization. The president doesn't trust the vice president. And how'd you get to be president anyway? I was elected. -By whom? -By me. Now look honey, if you just be patient you'll get all the Westing-gouse appliances that you need for your dressing room, but right now why don't you go to lunch and take the afternoon off like a nice little girl. [ Phone rings] Hello? Mr. Hayden? Oh yes. Send him right in. Mr. Hayden? Well at least I'll get a chance to say hello to him. Hello. Goodbye. And that is all. Oh, hi. Hello Mr. Hayden. You know my wife. Yes, we had quite a chat about some appliances for her dressing room. Hello and goodbye. Mr. Hayden, Lucy won't be able to go with us on the studio tour. She has a lunch and appointment. Oh, I'm sorry. I could break it. Goodbye dear. Why don't you come down to my store tomorrow and place your order there? -Goodbye honey. -Bye... I just hate goodbyes, don't you? Unless of course the goodbyes are the kind on those wonderful Westinghouse appliances. -Adios. -Adios. We decided to wait a little while on the appliances. He decided. I didn't. See he's the president. I understand. Well whenever you are ready Mrs. Arnaz we have some wonderful things for you. And we have some wonderful things for you and all your Westing-gouse dealers too, in our new Westing-gouse Desilu Playhouse for the fall. He means Westinghouse. -Adios. -Adios. I just want to stay 2 more minutes. I just want to take another look at the catalog book before you have to give it back to Mr. Hayden. I won't say a word. -Won't you sit down? -Yes. I'm real anxious to hear about the Playhouse. Those Westinghouse television shows in the past have been a great thing for our business. Oh you mean shows like Studio and the political conventions, election returns stuff like that? Yeah. And the college and pro football telecasts. Best of broadway. That was one of the first color T.V. series. Oh, well you know those shows have been great alright. We just hope that our series will be the best yet. We like to do the kind of shows for you fellas that we have found to be the most successful in the past. You know, shows that, well that deal with real people. And real stories. People that you like to identify yourself with. We like to mix them up a little bit. You know a good melodrama. A good suspense show. A real good western. With a, you know with a good basic dramatic story with it. A comedy. A comedy you know. Shows that you're gunna watch with your whole family. And watch week after week. Shows that will uh... Pick up more dirt faster than anything else. Oh, sorry. I was just reading about the all new Westinghouse mobile speed vacuum cleaner. It's a dilly. Is that right? Wow. And you know something wonderful has happened since we announced this Westing-gouse Desilu Playhouse for next fall. We have a great amount of creative talent here at Desilu, but since we made the announcement, all the other wonderful people around town have been calling us wanting to join the team, you know. People like uh, well, writers like Aaron Spelling, and Rod Serling, and Adrians Spies. Carson Canon. So that we're lining up quite a team for you. First like I told you is going to be Bernadette. And that was going to be written by gal by the name of Ludi Claire who did a wonderful job on Bridge of St Luis Rey. So that uh, with this creative talent and with biggest stars in show business to uh... Wash rinse and dry your dishes. Lucy! Say this Westinghouse dish washer's pretty exciting. What about the Luci-Desi hour shows? Will that be part of the Playhouse? Oh you bet. Sure. You know during the year we would do about 7 big special shows. As a matter of fact, we open the season in October. That's the one that Maurice Chevalier is in. Hey, will the Mertz's be in it? [ Laughs ] We wouldn't do a show without the Mertz's. Or Little Ricky. And of course I'll be on hand every week to produce the show and also to be your host. Sounds like you're going to be pretty busy. No busier than you Westinghouse we hope. How can we miss? I happen to know that your 5 Luci-Desi shows last season got the 5 biggest ratings of the year. Averaging over 50 million viewers a show. That's money in the bank for us. Well and I think that the Playhouses will attract the big audience every week too because well, like Westinghouse we know we've got a good product that the people will like to buy. Say I hope you don't mind my asking about the commercials but you know they're important to us fellas. Oh I know. I know. And we thought about them a lot too. You see in our shows, uh, it will be only Betty Furness doing the commercials, ya know? Lucy and I will be selling all the different things Westinghouse makes. Yes we want everybody in the country to know what a wonderful company Westinghouse is. That's right. You know I don't know if you know this but a few months ago I took a tour of all the Westing-gouse plants throughout the country. And I never realised what a really tremendous offer this is. You know, how many great things they do for American business. You know to help make American the great country that America is. I mean, things that the industry of America needs. And on our show, we know we are going to be talking to all kinds of people. To company presidents, to purchasing agencies. To people in government. And we are going to be talking to them right in their home. That's where John Cameron Swayze comes in. Oh by the way 3 out of 4 commercials will feature the electric appliances that you sell Mr. Hayden. I'll bet John Cameron Swazey and Betty Furness have Westinghouse appliances in their dressing rooms. Isn't it time for you to go to lunch. If I had a Westinghouse electric range in my dressing room I wouldn't have to go to lunch. Lucy! And, you won't be needing that dear. Oh she can keep that if she likes. Thanks but by the time he lets me buy anything, the 1961 catalog will be out. -Hi. -Oh, hi. Hello, how are you? Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley. I would like you to meet Mr. Hayden. He's a Westing-gouse dealer. One of our sponsors. -Hi boss. -How do you do? I'm out in Beverly Hills. Oh that's nice. I'll drop by and see you. Desi we just stopped by to see if you and Lucy would like to join us for lunch. We're going over to the commisary. Well I can't go, I have to take Mr. Hayden on a tour of the studios but Lucy can. Here Bill... Oh, no, no, no you don't. This is my treat. Fred Mertz might be a tight wad but not Bill Frawley. Oh, well in that case Bill we'll go to Romanoff. Romanoff?! Okay Fred Mertz, we'll go to the commissary. We better get going. The helicopter is waiting in the parking lot. Helicopter? Oh, yeah. I want you to get a birds-eye view of all the Desilu studios. See you later. Bye. Adios. Let's eat. I'm starved. Okay Ethel. The name is Vivian. The name may be Vivan, but the appetite is Ethel. You coming Lucy? Yeah but let's eat in a hurry. I have a lot a business to transact with Mr. Hayden and I need you two to help me. What business? Westinghouse business for my new dressing room. Is this a plot to put something over on Desi? Well... As Betty Furness would say, "You can be sure if it's Lucy." [ Laughs ] Well there she is Mr. Hayden. Desilu tower. Didn't that used to be RKO? That's right Mr. Hayden. They made a lot of great pictures down there. And you know when we bought it we not only got all the buildings and the sound stages, we acquired millions of feet of stock film suitable for back grounds in our television shows. Plus a huge property department and sets and costumes, well. Well, all kind of assets that'll give our Westing-gouse Desilu Playhouse great production values. Why don't we go over and take a look at motion picture center. It's just a few blocks away. There it is. There is where we make the I Love Lucy shows which were filmed in front of live audiences. You see most of those sound stages are equipped with seats for just that purpose. And we plan to do our Lucy specials over there, see? And if you or any of the other dealers want to see our show being filmed we'll have to have you. Thanks. I'll take you up on that. Now what do you say we swing on over to Desilu Culver? See that's Desilu Culver, which includes our huge back-lot known as 40 acres. For obvious reasons. You call it 40 acres because it is 40 acres. [ Laughs ] All that stuff is for exteriors, you know, outdoor action stuff. Right now we're building a whole village down there. A whole western town. That looks enormous! Well to give you an idea how big it is, that's where they made Gone With the Wind. You know one thing is sure, you're not gunna be cramped with space. No sir. Not with 35 sound stages and 3 studios. You know we are going to really try and do a good job for you fellas. What do you say we go back to Desilu tower and continue the tour? Hi. What are you 2 doing here? Oh, we didn't have anything to do after lunch so we thought we'd go on the rest of the tour with you and Mr. Hayden. Oh good. Where's Lucy? Oh she had things to do. Good. Desi could we talk to you privately for a second please? Sure. Excuse me. Now, I want one of these. Uh-huh. And one of these in lemon yellow. And both of these. Later. Oh, you know him? Him? Oh, uh... He's one of my old costumers. Oh, is that so? Well come on, I'll show you the inside of the studios. See, here's the set we're just getting ready for Bernadette. The Miracle of Bernadette. That's going to be one of your shows. It's got a wonderful cast, headed by Pier Angeli. Oh, she's wonderful. Oh, Desi, could I see you for a minute? What for dear? I have an interesting idea I'd like to talk over with you. The painter on the ladder. Oh, it's alright. It's me, Mrs. Arnaz. Oh. Uh. We left off on page 11 I think. Yes. I want one of those with all the attachments. Uh-huh. And one of these but the portable one. Shh... They're coming back. You crazy? Well now Desi... Oh for goodness sake. What's a matter? Vivan wants to play Bernadette. That would be a miracle. Come on, I want to show you the Mexican set. Okay. See you later. You know him too? Oh sure. Another one of my old costumers. Oh. Isn't that nice. I'm glad to see our employees are partial to Westinghouse products. You know if I didn't know I was in Hollywood I would swear I was in Mexico. Well you know in a way you are. This is a reproduction of a Tijuana street we are using in our first Lusi-Desi hour. The one Maurice Chavallier is in. Oh, don't let me forget let me show you a film clip of Chevallier's numbers. [ Bell rings ] Man: Alright, quiet please. Quiet everybody. There going to shoot a scene right now. We can watch it. Action! [ Crowd yelling ] [ Car horns honking ] [ Yelling in spanish ] [ Blowing whistle ] Man: Cut it and print it. Looks like it's going to be a great show. Oh I hope so. You know Mr. Hayden another special feature for you fellows every one of the Luci-Desi shows is going to have dealer promotion theme. Like for example this one the theme is fiesta. To tie in with the commercials ya know? And all the dealers will be getting fiesta merchandise stuff. And local ads. And point of sale merchandise. You know, stuff like this. And many of our shows will also have a special product promotion. Oh, sounds like Westinghouse is going all out. Well, this is a partnership deal. We're both going all out. Oh, Des, could I see you over here for a minute. Excuse me will you. Sure. -Yes? -I want to ask you about... [ Knocks on glass ] You want one of those? Television set? This one? Not that small? A big one? What size screen? What size screen?! Oh, 21 inch? I don't know what's gotten in to you two. Now he wants to take the part of Betty Furness in the first show. Come on. I'll show you a lot of other things around here. Boy this is really something. You got enough stuff in here to fill a museum. This is the prop building I was telling you about. We've got three floors just like this. Their full of every conceivable kind of prop you can think of. Course what we don't have our crews can build. Recognize this little fella? No, who is it? One of your relatives? [ Laughs ] This happens to be the star of one of the most famous pictures ever made. King Kong. That little thing? Your Kidding. Nope. That's right. This is the original King Kong. Looks different than when he was standing on top of the Empire State Building. Doesn't he? You see that's what they do with special effects. And we intend to use a lot of special effects to heighten the dramatic values of our productions. Now, uh, over here... Desi! Uh, uh... Could Bill see you about something. -Now what? -Confidential. Excuse me. Look around. Remember me? Mrs. Arnaz. Oh, I should have known. Something else you need? No, I just want to found out about delivery. How about Thursday? Thursday?! I need them today. Well if i can get away long enough to place a rush order I guess we could... Shh! Cheese it! That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. Making a lamp out of King Kong? Well we just thought... Nevermind! Don't tell me he's one of your costumers. Oh, no, no. I was just thinking that if we can sell to gorillas we can expand the market. Oh. [ Laughs ] Expand the market. Very funny. Look I wanted to show you a preview of our first show but the film won't be ready till 5 o'clock. That'll work out just fine. You see I have special rush order to take of and well I'll meet you back here. Good. My office at 5 o'clock right? Right. See you then. You know I must say you are doing everything possible to help us get costumers into our stores. Well we're going to do even more than that. You remember George Murphy? The actor? Sure. He's one of my costumers. That right? Well George is one of our vice presidents here at Desilu. He's vice president in charge of public affairs. And he's going to a good will ambassador for you fellows. He's going to go to all the Westing-gouse gatherings all over the country to help push your products whenever and wherever he can. Can't ask for more than that. Desi, it's been wonderful. I want to thank you for showing me around. Oh, it's been a pleasure. I'm glad you could come over. Oh, listen, uh, I'd like to stop by Lucy's dressing room before you... Her dressing room? Yes. Look, uh, it's a little bit late. I think I'd better get back to the store. I want you to see it so you know what it needs when we are ready to place the other. Really Desi. I won't have time. It will only take a minute. It's right around the corner from my office. Come on. Here we are. This is Lucy's dressing room here. Is Lucy here? Lucy? No, she's not in there. Oh, good. Then she won't bother Mr. Hayden while I... Oh, Lucy! Oh... Yeah, she's in there. Better not go in. Some other time. No, as long shes here we'll go in now. Uh, Desi, she's dressing. Oh, excuse me a minute. [ Knocks at door] Lucy? It's me. [ Knocks louder ] Lucy?! Open up! It's the president! What's going on here? Everybody crazy or something? Lucy?! Lucy?! Lucy! Lucy! You get out of here right away! You get out! Come on out! I can't. I'm not dry yet. Lucy, what is the meaning of this?! I'm just trying to show good faith in our new sponsors, Westing-gouse. I mean West... Oh you got me doing it! [ Shouting in Spanish ] Well, we'll see you in October folks. If she's dry by then. Name is Lucille Ball and I've got a secret. Thank you. Good evening. Welcome to another edition of I've got a secret. Before we get officially on the way, I wouldpplike you to meet the members of our panel: Bill Cullen is on vacation this week the lucky stiff. But we're lucky too because in his place we have good friend Johnny Carson. How are you Johnny? Next to John is Betsy Palmer. And comes Henry Morgan. And Beth Myers. And that's our group. It is time for us to meet a really special guest. One of Hollywoods most successful movie actresses. Certainly televisions most successful comedian. And now she's doing it all over again right here on broadway where she is currently starting in the hit musical, wild cat. We are grateful to say here is Lucille Ball. Lucy! Anybody upstairs? -Huh? -Anybody upstairs? Yeah, yeah. Lucy. You've been away too long. They miss you. Thank you. Lucille, the first thing everyone said when they found out you were going to be on our show tonight was: Let's get Lucy to do some imitations and some mimicry because that's the kind of thing that everybody loves. -You clowning around. -Well, I... Rather enjoy doing it sometimes. Don't worry. I said no because I said itppisn't fair to make Lucille Ball work as hard as she's working on Wildcat to come out here and work hard on our show. Thank you. I said let them panel do all the work. -Oh bless you. -Aren't I nice? Now you're secret will be that you're trying to get the panel to imitate you. This way I don't have to work, huh? You don't have to do any work at all. We do this through the power of suggestion you see. We do? You do. It's a psychological fact that you can get people to do things without there even knowing there being urged to do it. I believe that most emotions and moods are contagious. Hm-hm. Tell me more. Well alright. Here's what happens. Suppose you get excited with one of our panelists when they're questioning you. I bet they'll get excited right back without even realizing it. If you're said, they'll get sad. You think so, really? I'm sure. All you have to get them to do to get them to imitate you is to answer questions with different emotions and they'll follow along like sheep. You want a bunch of sheep running around here, huh? If anything, I guess. So I happen to have here a little list of different emotions. Excited, happy, dignified, sad, nervous. All you have to do Is change from those from time to time while you're questioning and watch the panel. They'll do just as you do. I'll bet ya. Can we have the panel back in please? How do you do what you do? What do you mean? Having time to visit with us while you're swinging that wild show down the street. Well we have an hour here and there. But we're so grateful to you. Thank you Gary. Alright panel. You know Lucy Ball. If you don't you've missed a great deal in your life. Hi Lucy. The clue to her secret concerns something that she's doing. And uh, who shall we start with? Uh, Betsy. Let's start with Betsy. -Are you doing it now Lucy? -What? -Are you doing it now? -Doing what? -Whatever you're doing. -I don't understand. The question is that something you're doing is that your secret. I can't here you Betty. Something you're doing is your secret. -Yeah, ask me. -You're doing something to me. Alright, there is something you're doing is physical. Oh yes, slightly. Is it.. What?! Is it something... You're not listening? Yes, I am! Yes, I am! Is it something that you're going to involve any of us here on the panel. Oh I do hope so. Is it going to involve the boys more than the girls? -I don't think so. -You're not doing it now? -Yes I am Betsy. -Are you? - You're being breathy? -No. You're learning projection? [ Laughs ] Is that it? Now you're learning how to laugh. Oh, no. Nobody has to teach you. That's delightful. It wasn't that good. [ Both laugh ] You're trying to make me do whatever you're doing. What, what, what? [ Buzzer ] No, no, no. Let's go to our next contestant. Let's go from Betsy Palmer to Henry Morgan. This thing you're doing, does it make you happy? I beg your pardon Henry. Am I coming in over there? Yes sir. Are you changing character independent of what the questions are? Not necessarily sir, no. Do you have preconceived plot? Shh... [ Gibberish ] See I forgot the next question. Are you, uhm, adopting an attitude, I asked that. Does anything that we say have any effect whatsoever on you? Occasionally but not tonight. Should I come back another night and ask another series of questions? Oh Henry. You're mad at me. You're hurt. You're displeased. No. -You're offended. -No. I did something wrong? You did something wrong? -No. -Gary keep out of this. -Are you deppressed? -Slightly, yes. What did I do? Oh, that's marvelous. That's marvelous. See? And so we turn our attention please to Beth Myers. [ Laughing ] Do you feel better/ Not really, no. I don't know how to talk to Beth. Beth's a person to know. Do you feel better Lucy? -What? -Do you feel better? Uh, better? I don't know whether I feel better or not. I remember our last meeting. Are you happier? What? Why does Henry upset you? -Henry didn't upset me. -No? Does he always upset you? -It's just something he said. -What did he say? What did he say? Well, uh... I'd rather not go into it right now, really, Beth. Is there anything happening... What was that Beth? Are you what? Uh, uh, uh... Is there anything happening behind us? I hope not. I think we call that one kind-of. And we go on now to Johnny Carson please. Well I got a question for you! -Yes, John. -Yes, John. [ Laughs ] [ Carson Speaking spanish ] Huh? You're reacting differently to each one of us. She didn't look at me like that. Neither did Gary. I didn't mean to be looking that way. Henry made you sad. Betsy made you... Johnny! Are you married? Are you? My story's the same as yours. No I wasn't married to Desi Arnaz! [ Laughs ] One more question John. John, you have time for one more question. Uh. Did you have a belt before you came on? No Johnny. We have lost the whole thing. As a matter of fact for one of the 2 or 3 times, in the 8 years of I've got a secret I cheated the panel. Somebody guessed it early when they said are trying to make us react in the same mood that you're acting and that was the answer but I didn't want to blow the whole rest of thing with Lucille Ball so I lied to you. Boldly lied and said no. But it was marvelous because you did exactly the same way. I never thought Henry would come through like that. He's a sad man at heart. Henry came through. Speaking for Lucille Ball and all of us here until next week: Good night and be kind to each other. Lucy, thanks so much. We plan to invite unto our program, experts and authorities in humor in every possible field. In modern art for instance. Ballet. Brick-laying. Pottery. Basket-weaving. In the field of transportation we have invited Miss Lucille Ball who as you will see is a complete stranger in the field. Oh. I wonder if you'd do me a favor? You see I have this girlfriend and she came to see me off and I promised to wave to her. Would you wave to Sally? She's the one in the trench coat standing by the gate. Oh, thank you very much. Are you going to Paris? Yes. So am I. [ Sighs ] My what a wonderful age we live in. Breakfast in Los Angeles. Dinner in Paris. It's very exciting, isn't it? Frankly, my business takes me to Paris twice a month, so it isn't very exciting for me. I get sick of flying. Oh so do I. If it's just a jet here, jet there. Here a jet, there a jet. Everywhere a... It's a real drag isn't it. May I have your coat. Oh, thank you. Oh, would you put this in the refrigerator for me? Would be happy to. The girls at the office gave it to me. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Don't let it get too frozen. No, it'll be fine. Fasten your seatbelts please. Oh yes. Seat belt. You better fasten your seatbelt. I'd like to. I'll give you one of these for one of those. Do you think they'll mind? Alright. Fair exchange. [ Sighs ] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. Since our portion of our flight will be over water I would like to demonstration how to put on a life jacket. Which you will find under your seat. The chance of you having to use the jacket are very remote but regulations do require this demonstration. I've seen this a hundred times. Yeah... That stale bit. After the jacket is securely tied it is inflated by pulling these nobs. However please do not inflate the jacket until you are instructed to do so. Thank you. Would you care for some chewing gum? Oh no thank you. It's for your ears. Oh, I forgot. Does it really help? It relieves the pressure on your ears when you chew the gum. Care for some champagne? Oh thank you. I hope they serve lunch pretty soon. I didn't have any breakfast this morning. Oh, to a bon voyage. Oh the boniest! This is delicious. Yes it is good. Boy I hope they serve lunch pretty soon. What's that? A little turbulence. Oh I guess a little turbulence never hurt anybody. Whoops. It is getting rough. More champagne? Why not? No thank you. Boy I hope they serve lunch pretty soon. You know I like you. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Secret? I have never been a plane before. You're kidding. Couldn't tell could you? I would have sworn you were Jacqueline Cochran. Oh you. Boy I hope they serve lunch pretty soon! [ Life jacket inflating loudly ] What are you doing with your life jacket on?! Life jacket?! Life jacket, what's going on here? We must be getting ready to ditch in the ocean! Good heavens we're getting ready to ditch! [ Everyone shouting ] How do you get this on? You've got yours on! Don't take it away from me! Just a minute. Ladies and gentlemen please sit down! Follow me!
