You have to learn how to handle all these! That's it... You are clear in all issues... why are you confused in this? You may happen to meet a guy whom you like in your life in future... -Please! What please? lt happens...that's it! lt may happen! There is no wrong in that... Because we don't do looking for it... lt happensautomatically! But when it happens so...you have to take decision clearly by thinking well! Now listen to me! lt's not only your right but also your duty to arrange your life as you wish... lt's your duty...got it? Now take this! Take this...give back to him and mind your work! That's true, daddy! lf l had unnecessarily gone to the Principal and complainedagainst him... ...his future would have been spoiled!

Don't you like to shout with joy? How do you know? - You have once said...- When? When l asked for a cycle for the first time! One minute! Happy birthday, daddy! Thank you! You shout, daddy! Abhi! Abhi! Where are you? What happened? What happened? Hot water spilled... - Where? On whom? Are you kidding? Why have you shouted now? l shouted with joy! - l will also shout if you tell me! Letter again? Daddy! l got admission for MBA... - What? MBA? -Yes!Where? -Delhi! Delhi?- Yes daddy! Jawaharlal Nehru University... That'sall not possible! -What's not possible? Should she go only to Delhi to study MBA? lf she got seat in Delhi... Will she go to Mumbai! There is a good college in Coimbatore... she can study there! Well sir? Does she get seat in Coimbatore for this letter? Have new rules been passed? - Hey...l will kill you! Daddy! lt'sa very big institution! l got this seat with great difficulty! That'salright... But l say 'No'! That's it... Do you know how my mother struggled to get seat in that college? -Hey! Hubby! She appliedafter informing you, didn't she? You signedthe application form, didn't you? l have signedand thought she would not get seat! lf she goes to Delhi, what can l do? -Are you kidding? Many people sendtheir daughters to America and London to study... What if you send her to Delhi which is nearby? What daddy! For only two years, right? As soon as the vacation is given... l will come back! - Not like that honey... You have been brought up here comfortably... How can you stay in Hostel there? - No problem...daddy! lf the Hostel doesn't suit you... -Daddy! l know what l am doing! Please daddy! Only two years...would pass! l am goingto come here after that, ain't l? Not like that...Abhi? How can l stay in this house without you for two years? Daddy! Until l come...it's Abhi! You pass your time with this... Only two years, right? ...would pass! One minute! One minute! l will tell you what might have happened next... You would have also gone to Delhi... ...been settledand following her wherever she went, right? l did not go anywhere, sir! l have been here itself! But the day when Abhi went to Delhi... ..looked like the day when she went to school for the first day! All the best! What hubby? The house without Abhi seemed to be very emptied! l ask only two questionsat her every arrival for vacation... How long will you stay? And when will you come back? Having completed her studies... My Abhi returned back! l felt as if l got back the entire happiness l lost... You see...l never thought of Abhi's next stage! But when Abhi came from Delhi this time... she had come with one decision! Ah! Varadharajulu is coming! l don't know what he asks now... What Raghu? Have you come to worship God? No! We have come to eat... -Eat! Eat! Abhi! ln a temple similar to this... l asked your mother if we would get married! Givinga flower from her basket... she ran sparkinga little smile! You see...she is coming! Even if l think now... it looks like a magic!- Magic! Which flower did you give, mummy? Do you remember, Anu? 25 years ago...ln a temple similar to this... -Shit! Go away! Why do you talk about our love before her? ls it necessary now? You are always so! Daddy! As the magic took place in your life... Amagic took place in my life too, daddy! l have met a guy in Delhi, daddy! He had come to the college seminar! We have moved like friends in the beginning... But l love him, daddy! l would like to marry... Have you gone to study or to love? Non-sense! What happened to you? Why did you talk with her so? Then...At the time of studying in college! What is love? Oh! How had we loved? You were wandering in streets leavingthe college.. Have you forgotten that? Oh! ls such a story there? -Hey...she is my relative! lf so...can you love? - Hey...ldiot! Before marriage itself... we were relatives! lt's okay... -Oh! She had seen a guy in Delhi! They both like each other and want to get married! Has she hidden from you? She has decently come andtold you, hasn't she? How can you talk with her so? -That's what l say...how dare she is! She straightly comesand asks me... Alas! What is this, sir? Would she ask Y.S.Rajasekhar Reddy instead of asking you? Hey... Why do you all support her? You both together have spoiled her... -What? l ask you asa mother... Do you have an idea to get her married or not? l have to do... l will do... l look for a Groom who is set at our house! Then...Abhi would be with us, right? Abhi will be with us! Will she be happy?- For that... Sending her with someone else to Delhi... -What can l do? That's it, isn't it? You said correctly, sister! l also thought the same... Hey dear! Do you know how difficulty l faced when she went to Delhi for 2 years? Look here! This is her life! She only has the right to decide about it! Son-in-law is coming tomorrow from Delhi! We have to go to Airport to receive him! Son-in-law? -Yes! Have you fixed it? -Yes! Whom has he asked to come here? Don't you have to inform me all these? -Where have you let us inform? l won't come to airport tommorow - You should come... l won't come...l won't come at all! - You should come... l suffer from fever tomorrow... Take Crocin tablets now and come tommorow... Sir! l am actually going to the Medical shop... What about tomorrow, sir? Would you suffer only from fever or something else too? Hey...l will kill you! There you see...the flight has come! Hubby! Hubby! The flight has come... -l know! Alas! We have come with bare hands... We have to give somethingto son-in-law! What to give? Take a coconut shell and give him! l will standthere... Bring if he comes! lt's my foolishness to ask him! Abhi... Greetings sir! l am Jogindhar Singh! You can call meJogi! With the pleasure meeting you! Sorry! Sorry! Aunty! You look so young... Actually you look like Abhi's sister! What is he saying? He says that mummy looks like my sister! -He said correctly... Many people think so... You know something...mom speaks Hindi! - Really? -Yeah! Yes! l learnt in school... But l am not in touch with that! How wonderful! You speak Hindi very well... ...and uncle, what about you? lf anyone speaks...l understand that he is speaking in Hindi! What does it mean? Sir doesn't know...Only Telugu and little English! Hey...Do you speak Hindi? l begged in the old city for 2 years, right? Mother! What does our sir do in Delhi? He wants to know what you do in Delhi! - Who? Me? Well...l am an lndependent Journalist and an Economist! Oh! That job? Sir! What is meant by lndependent Journalist? lt meansJobless fellow! lf so...Was l an lndependent Journalist once upon a time? l was calleda Beggar then! What is happening here? What is happening here? -Why? What happened? You said that son-in-law was comingfrom Delhi... l thought Hritik Roshan or Abhishek Bachan was coming... Harbajan Singh has come! What is there for that? Do you say, ''What is there for that?'' How is it? When Abhi gives birth to a child.. will you play in Hindi? Or else...will you dance following her? l know Hindi...You go and dance if you want! - Don't joke! Don't you have to inform me all these? -She has said, hasn't she? Whom has she said? - She has told me! What dear? She says everythingto me... Has she said only this to you? Look here! Certain things can be shared only with mother... What? How are you able to take all these simple? Hubby! We have also got married by loving each other, haven't we? What a struggle we faced! What an insult we borne! Howfear l hadto just inform my parents! Should our Abhi get such a situation? Shall l tell you what your problem is? lf you had a son and he had fallen in love like this... You would not have been talked so! The problem is since it's daughter! Why should my son have to love a Sardarji? Please come to have food without joking rubbish... We have to discuss many things! Abhi! Bring son-in-law soon... Okay! Alliance seeker has to come along with his family, right? Why has he come alone? Pigs come crowded... Singh comes single! Hey...you shut up your mouth! Son-in-law has no parents... - Why? ls he a test tube baby? He hasa only grand mother! Fully done! What is this? - Chapati? What is this? -Rajma! - Who is that Rajamma? That'sa Punjabi vegetable... l don't want all these rubbish... l want ldli with Sambar! No ldli and Dosa... For afternoon also...sister! What is that? Dal Ambani? Shit! Dal Makini! Yes! Dal Makini...Pulavu! Everything is getting ready...you also get ready to eat! l don't know all that... l want only ldli with Sambar! Hello! -Hello! -Hi! -Hi! Oh! Chapatis... But l was expecting Dosa and Sambar... l thought that you would like thisand preparedthis! No problem! But for lunch... l get south lndian food, don't l? Sambar...Rasam and Pappad! - Yes! Sure! Sure! Mummy prepares the curry of lady's finger very well... - ls it? -Yes! l mean...food is very good! Oh! Do you know Telugu? Abhi taught me a bit Telugu... l will learn fully very soon! Very good! Daddy! We have fixedthe marriage on August 16th! -For whom? Oh! August 16th! But...there is only 2 month's time! l have to print wedding cards... l have to fix Marriage Hall! How many things have been left! -Those are not required, daddy! Not required in the sense... l don't understand! We have decidedto simply get register marriage... After that...a small reception! What are you talking? You are my only daughter... How dream l have to organise your marriage grandly! What dear? Why is it, daddy? lt'sall waste of time and money, isn't it? How can that we... -Uncle! Actually Abhi is right... You know? Accordingto recent economic survey... We lndians spendaround 2000 crores alone on weddings every year! That means?- ln our country, for only weddings... around 2000 crores is spent per year! O my God! How clear our son-in-law is! Our guy doesn't know how much is spent in our house alone! Hey...you keep calm! How would my daughter's marriage be waste of money? l don't accept for this register marriage... -Accept it, daddy! Hubby! She is right in what she says... This is her marriage... let it take place as she wishes! Please daddy! Okay! All decisions have been taken by you... What can l say in this? Okay! Pour that Rajamma! What happened now? Why are you sitting like this? ls that it? -What? She has suddenly brought someone... She says that she will marry him! She says that she goes to Delhi! l fear dude... lt happens in everyone's house... Hasn't Anu left her parents and been living with you? All of you say the same! - Hey...look here! We just give birth to children and bring up... That's it! Beyond this...We don't have any right over them! As responsible parents...we have to give them a shelter and wings to fly... That's it! - lf so...Will it fly at once? Don't you like that Groom now? - l like very much! l first feared to tell you! When you first said... l got a bit shocked! But...l likedthe way you said! With the confidence that you took a good decision... You boldly expressed your love, didn't you? l got full confidence by then itself! -Thank you, mummy! Son-in-law is fairly tall, isn't he? As it's not wrongaccording to law... he grew such taller! Taller than me... Aturban above the head! l really tell you... l never dreamt of my son-in-law having turban! He says Economist...Journalist! l don't understandanything! Let it be... What does he earn? what type of family is his? l know nothing... What are you talking? Abhi told me that he wasa member in a planning commission... Her face... l dont have belief! l have belief, mummy! Daddy would understand... Won't he? -Sure! Has he ever said ''Yes'' as soon as you asked? Daddy fears so much that any wrong might happen regarding you... How can l be without fear? lf he isa local... we can enquire who and what he is! Whom do l know in Delhi? Hey...Don't get tensed unnecessarily! l have confidence on Abhi! l have more confidence on the Groom! On that Sardarji? -Yes! You have not seen him yet! -Hey...Hey Raghu! Do you know one thing? l was in Delhi earlier, wasn't l? Then...my friends had come to Delhi for sight-seeing! l bookeda taxi! The driver of that taxi wasan old Sardarji! You know it, don't you? As soon as our guys saw the Sardarji... they started saying Sardarjijokes! But that person did not utter even a word! After the sight-seeing completed... l gave money when l got down! He had not taken even a paise more than the metre amount! He told me when he wasabout to leave... Brothers! You have said many Sardarji jokes... You are young guys... you have said ignorantly! He asked me if l could help him for once... and gave me a one rupee coin! He asked me to lay this for the first Sardarji beggar in Delhi! Hey...You believe or don't believe! The one rupee coin is still with me... l have wanderedaround entire Delhi! l couldn't find evenone Sardarji beggar! Then only l came to knowthat Sardarji would be an owner... They run shops...Garraige...Dhaba! l learnt that they won't begat all... We are wandering here joblessly telling Sardarjijokes here! They are very great people... You will understand gradually... Trust me! Have you come? Come on... Come on! Daddy! Come on...Jogi's interview! Okay honey! l change the dress and come... The interview would be completed before that! Come on! Come on...daddy!

Do you want to be away leaving me alone? Do you want to seperate forgetting everything? Do you want to be away leaving me alone? Do you want to seperate forgetting everything? Getting bored upon the heart that you rest ever... Do you want to be away leaving me alone? Do you want to seperate forgetting everything? l still remember the hands that never leave the finger! l still hear the sound of eyelids that close for the lullaby! The foot print has stroked me at the edge of my heart! The celebration of day to day festival has yet driven me away! So far...So long... you have been my world! As your father... ls there anything lacking with me? Lookingfor an other way... Do you want to be away leaving me alone? Do you want to seperate forgetting everything?

There is Veerji, isn't he? He had a son! He was studying well... Somehow he has become a terrorist by changing his mind set!

How happy they are! Jogi is the reason for that... He is the only relation for them in this world... ln their family... The auspicious occasion that takes place after a long time at their end is this marriage, daddy! Your son-in-law is really great, sir! You are right! Sudhakar! We never understand the people who stay near us... We misunderstand that we have understood! ln fact... l have lately understood my Anu! What happened Anu? What dear? Nothing! There is only 2 days left... After that...Abhi will get married and leave, won't she? l can manage somehow... l fear thinking of you! You can bear, can't you? l don't know, Anu! l will stay... l must stay, mustnt l? What to do? l have to convince myself thinkingthat she is just in Delhi! You are also with me, aren't you? l stay boldly... l understand something now, Anu! l have not understoodanyone! When l married you fighting against your parents... l felt happy as if l had achieved something great! As you have not talked with them for me for these many years... l was proud of it!
