[film reel whirring] [logo explodes] [mellow piano music] [Lucas] You know, as much as I worry about our country and we have a lot to worry about now, it's stories like The Black Cat that give me hope. What this story tells me is that each of us matters. What we do matters. And as big as our challenge is, they can be changed. At the Black Cat Tavern, people were here, they were having a good time. They were here for a party. It was New Year's Eve. They were gonna bring in 1967 and the clock was ticking down to that big moment. [typewriter clicking] [dinging] [engine revving] [upbeat music] ♪ I got to get me A leather jacket ♪ ♪ I got to get me a chain ♪ ♪ I got to get me a motorcycle ♪ ♪ Man, I feel no pain ♪ ♪ I'd rather fight than swish ♪ ♪ I'd rather fight than swish ♪ [Laverne] Charles Tally and Benny Baker were getting ready to go to The Black Cat to ring in the new year. The gay community always lived in fear of persecution but found solace at the bars. There, one could create a family when family had turned their backs on you. A place to feel safe, to feel welcome, to feel like you belong. That night, seven undercover police officers waited for the stroke of midnight. Strangely enough, the places that provided refuge were also places where one could be most vulnerable, when one could find themselves in jail for something as simple as a kiss. [Alexei] One was in a white dress. They saw what was going on, they turn around, they ran back out. They headed down to the new faces. When the police came in, they said, &quot;Who's the owner or the manager of this place?&quot; And someone pointed and said, &quot;Leroy,&quot; which sounded like a man's name. They immediately went over, grabbed her, beat her, they broke her collarbone. The bartender seeing this happen was coming around the bar, they grabbed him, they dragged him over the bar, they ruptured his spleen. Now this 230 pound cop said that the bartender attacked them. He was 105 pounds. And this is the reason they were arrested for lewd conduct. They chose to plead not guilty. They were found guilty in the local court. The ACLU provided them with an attorney, Herb Selwin, who appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court and apparently Selwin's writ to the court is the first one ever to assert that gay people have equal rights under the law to protection under the law. And at that particular moment in history, actually had a group of undercover policemen who were trained. They were B movie actors, that was part time. They would get very attractive men. They would basically train them in which they'd show them how to go into a public restroom and engage with a person in the restroom and then to handcuff them and take them into custody after their approach. [Alexei] We heard about it. And how did we hear about it? There was no Internet. It was word of mouth, phone tag. 15 people would call 15 people. Those 15 people would call 15 people and that's how the word got out. We were sick and tired of being sick and tired of being preyed upon. I belonged to this organization that had started a number of months earlier. I got involved with Pride because of some things that had been happening. That was our newsletter. This is a duplicate copy, the original is very fragile, but this is the first copy of Pride, the publication. Stood for Personal Rights Through Defense and Education. You can see this is May of 1966. [Laverne] The protesters could not make a sound and could not stop walking. Otherwise, they'd be arrested for disturbing the peace or loitering. [Alexei] There were 500 to 600 gay men, gay women and those who support us. No regular press covered it, none. The only people who documented it was the free press. To the faces of the people holding the signs, you can see terror, you can see exhilaration, you can see fear, you can see joy because for so many of them, they had never, ever been photographed as an out open gay or lesbian and they said, I'm gonna be photographed, I'm gonna risk everything and who knew where those photographs were going. It might go to their parents who would disown them, it might go to their employer who would fire them. But they collectively said enough is enough, we're gonna be out and we're gonna put our lives on the line. And what a legacy they have left the rest of us. And what a responsibility we have because of their sacrifice. Now the demonstration was sponsored by something called Religion and the Homophile, a group of progressive ministers, liberal ministers who were organizing this. It was a event against police brutality. Indeed, the owners of the carriage trade which was a gay restaurant- bar in West Hollywood, forbid who was putting money into this, forbid the word gay or homosexual to even be mentioned at the rally itself. There were rallies held in Silver Lake, in West Hollywood, and different parts of the city. There was a black civil rights movement, there was an anti-war movement. There was a women's liberation movement. There was gay liberation, there was social justice. So it's everything that was going on at that time fed into this. Reed Erickson is an individual who lived here in Los Angeles and he was one of the first individuals in the United States to receive gender reassignment surgery. That was in 1967. And Reed started this educational foundation and became involved with One, which at the time was the One Institute, to help the transgender community learn about medical treatments that were available, surgery that was available, their legal rights. And it was really, as it stated, an educational foundation for the transgender community. [Troy] In 1968, I took a date down to Wilmington, which is a part of the dock area of Los Angeles. And it was the first gay dance bar in the city. And Lee Glaze owned it. And that night, the LAPD came in in plain clothes. My date walked over to Bill Hastings. He was gonna order us two beers, and he did. And Bill was a friend of the bar owners and they started capping. And my date said something funny, Bill said something funny. My date said something funnier still and Bill slapped him on the rump and they were arrested for lewd and lascivious conduct. Lee Glaze, the owner of the bar said, there's got to be a florist here. I'm gonna buy every flower you have. We got into cars, 11 cars, went down to the police station. Lee walked in with all these flowers and said, we're here to bail our sisters out of jail. And the cop said, who are your sisters? And he said, Bill Hastings and Tony [indistinct]. And it scared the cop to death. Now I'm watching this and he called for backup and all at once eight cops came forward, stood behind the desk with him and we waited. And it took us six hours to get them out of jail. [Laverne] Dick Michaels and Bill Rand had joined Pride and transformed the Pride newsletter into the Los Angeles Advocate. A year later, they paid the group one dollar to take it over and renamed it The Advocate. Dick worked at ABC and would mimeograph the newsletter after work in the basement. The Advocate has always been there. There was other people like me. You would go to the bookstore and you'd go to the gay bookstore and you'd see The Advocate. For me, The Advocate was really inspirational because it was one of the first times I started hearing LGBT stories told from our own perspective. It was eye opening. It's literally, not figuratively, been chronicled by The Advocate. All the good days, the bad days, the setbacks the despair, the triumphs referred to as indispensable because it is. It's a profoundly important historical contribution to a big part of what makes America great. [Cleve] It was difficult to get ahold of The Advocate in Phoenix back then and it was still printed on news print and whenever we got a copy, it would be shared and just passed from one person to the next, one kitchen table to the next. And we would read that thing until it disintegrated. Dick was an entrepreneurial individual. He saw possibilities there. He saw gay people becoming more and more visible, more and more out there, and he saw a business. He saw a business opportunity here. Not long after the magazine got started, he started to develop ancillary businesses. For example, every year there was something called The Groovy Guy Contest. ♪ He's well-adjusted I suppose ♪ It generated income for The Advocate. So he was a very astute business man. Reverend Troy Perry around this time was getting very active in these social circles and he decided to make a statement that God and gay were not mutually exclusive concepts. -Didn't MCC take out ads on The Advocate? -Yes, we did. I took out the first ad in The Advocate. I met the owners. They didn't want to sell me the ad. They said there's a lot of charlatans in the gay community, as they said back then, they said in the homosexual community and how do we know you're not one? Well, 45 minutes later they said, look, we will give you the first ad if you'll buy two more. And I said, if you will let me pay you after I hold the first service. [Jennifer] At the time when The Advocate started in 1967, people were being incarcerated for being openly gay. People could still be admitted to a &quot;mental institution&quot; at the time under the psychiatric guidelines. Conversion therapy, while it still exists today, and I know that we're working really hard to overturn conversion therapy laws, conversion therapy was prevalent in the '50s, '60s and even into the mid-'70s. An &quot;at home behavioral modification machine&quot;. It's called bug in the ear. They were provided by a psychiatrist and others to use at home. And so essentially, depending on the model that you received, there would be a projector and images would be shown on the projector and when there was an image that a parent or a physician or even in some cases a teacher thought was negative for that child, then the child would either be shocked or the child would receive a message through a device that was placed in the ear. [Jon] It was very fluid between who was gay, who wasn't. People did things with other people of all persuasions. Some of that was drugs, but not all of it and many of us didn't do drugs at all. The LA scene with The Doors and Sunset Strip. We'd go over, hang out, drive up and down the strip, especially if somebody had a convertible that was wonderful. Hitchikers, whatever, come on, let's jump on, go to Laurel Canyon. It was amazing. [Laverne] In the final hours of June 28, 1969, police raided The Stonewall Inn, a gay club in Greenwich Village. The raid sparked a riot as the marginalized bar patrons had finally had enough, leading to six days of protest and violent clashes with law enforcement. &quot;Homo Nest Raided, Queen Bees Are Stinging Mad.&quot; And I thank God for those cross-dressers who led that riot and turned on the police. [Andy] Stonewall, which is probably one of the most important milestones in LGBT history, but it's important that we understand that the grassroots movements in Southern California had a great impact on what was going on on the East Coast. The Gay Liberation Front here in Los Angeles in 1969 through the end of 1970 was really based on militant demonstrations, fighting back, being disruptive, taking over conventions of psychologists, going into court to get restraining order on the LAPD, et cetera, et cetera. Very militant and in your face action. The most popular bar in Los Angeles then was a bar called The Farm on Santa Monica Boulevard. We weren't allowed to touch or show affection in bars, weren't allowed to dance, any of that. And so the Gay Liberation Front started handing out leaflets a week before saying next Friday evening at 10 p.m. there is going to be a touch in. At 10 p.m. we shouted out, put your arm around each other, show affection to each other. Five police cars showed up, four county sheriffs got out and came into the bar and like an army of occupation walked slowly from the back front to the back and those gay men didn't budge. They didn't take their arms away whatsoever. I was never in my life so proud of a group of gay men as that evening. I started shouting Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, GLF is going to win, Gay Liberation Front. They walked out, they left, the lights went off, the music started again and that was the beginning of gay people being able to show affection in bars and a couple weeks after that dancing began. [Durk] There was gay liberation dances. And you'd meet other young guys that were sort of the same ilk, long hairs, freaks, you know, and it was really about a new sensibility about being who we were. The gay hotline was one of the only listings with the word gay in it in the country. We weren't even sure they were gonna give us a phone, but they did. And during the night, beginning around maybe one o'clock, two o'clock, calls would start coming in from all over the country to the Gay Liberation Front Hotline and there I was answering it. Lesbians talking about being thrown out of their apartment because of problems with boyfriends, problems with alcohol and drugs, losing their jobs, one thing after another, all the oppression of gay and lesbian people. And I began to realize that if we did not address these problems, these human problems of gay people, gay and lesbian people, We weren't worth-- we weren't worth what we said we were worth. I organized something called the Gay Survival Committee. How's that for a title, Gay Survival Committee? Which is the level at which we were operating at that time. Out of that Gay Survival Committee, Morris and I decided that we were going to end the Gay Liberation Front and we were gonna shift our attention to organizing a gay community center. No community existed at that time. And so the center was going to become a place around which a community could be organized. And there was a woman named June Herrle who-- She was the architect of the plan to provide social services because she and Morris Kight and Don Kilhefner and some of the other founders, John Platania, et cetera, they believed that if we were gonna be able to fight for our place in society, our equal place in society, we had to be healthy. Our center right here in Los Angeles was the very first openly LGBT organization to get nonprofit tax exempt status from the IRS. First, they denied it, telling us that we were clearly neither benevolent nor charitable. Our founders weren't gonna take that. So they went and found a lawyer. But back then, there weren't any openly gay lawyers in town and the closeted ones wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole. They found a straight, liberal lawyer at Legal Aid who took the case. When his bosses found out he'd taken the case, they tried to make him drop it because they didn't want to be associated with these queers. But he kept it, fought for three or four years and finally the IRS capitulated granting us the status, but with pages of conditions. And my two favorites were one, that we were disallowed from ever advocating that homosexuality was normal and two, we were expressly prohibited from having any avowed homosexuals on our board of directors. [Laverne] On June 28, 1970, the Gay Liberation Movement held a march in response to the one year anniversary of Stonewall. [Morris] And it was essential to get the word out that we are in the streets, we're not gonna take it anymore and we're going to demand for equality. [Don] They denied us a permit to march on Hollywood Boulevard. We went to the ACLU to get help and a judge says the Chief of Police has to give us a permit which we did. It was in the newspaper Saturday, the march was on Sunday and it brought out 35,000 people. They had a group of mounted police there. I guess that was for riot control. We weren't gonna riot. We just wanted to have fun and make a statement. One of them kind of turned his horse sideways and looked around at everybody that was there with 'em and went like this to us. And we went like this. And then he put his hands down fast. That parade was a little more than what it had started to be. We are everywhere. [Troy] 1973, when you came to the service, that was the first fire and we had four more that year. The third one was awful. 32 people died in it. New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the largest mass murder of homosexuals in American history. Twelve of the members of my church were burned to death, including our pastor, our assistant pastor and his lover. And when I got there, Major Morrison of the New Orleans Police Department, till he held a press conference and said, &quot;Oh, this was a club that was frequented by thieves, burglars and queers.&quot; And we held a press conference on top of the Marriott. I said these were not thieves, burglars and queers. These were somebody's children. That, the press turned around. I was determined to hold a memorial service for all the people who died and I kept trying to find a place and finally, little St. Mark's Methodist Church [indistinct], it was an African American pastor with five white women on his board. And I said, you don't know how much I appreciate how brave y'all are to let us use the building. She said, &quot;No Troy,&quot; she said, &quot;Having five white women with a black pastor.&quot; [Bruce] The decadence of the '70s. The decadence of my 70s which is coming up, that'll be much more interesting. In the '70s, first of all, several things happened. The most important thing that happened I think for everybody was birth control. When birth control came in, it changed the entire paradigm for straight people. And so that trickled down, that's exactly the phrase I want to use, to the gay community too because with straight people's libidos unleashed, it was okay to be a hedonist. Because straight people were doing it because that thing had been lifted, that fear of a pregnancy and commitment and all of that had been lifted. So people could just boogie on down. A lot of self-pleasuring, a lot of doing things without thinking about the consequences. One of the reasons was we didn't really know what the consequences were. We only knew what myth had told us. Homosexuality is an enigma. Even in this era of bold sexual mores, it remains a subject that people find disturbing, embarrassing. We discovered that Americans consider homosexuality more harmful to society than adultery, abortion or prostitution. [Fred] Few feet from Santa Monica Boulevard. When I used to come to Studio One in the '70s, I would park my car several blocks away. I would walk the opposite direction of traffic on Santa Monica Boulevard for fear of being seen. It's a horrific life living in the closet. I had a boyfriend. I had a very healthy gay life, but I was so petrified of coming out. Tales of the City had just come out and they did a story on me. And I saw it on the stands one night after I was leaving the Glory Holes on 6th Street. It was in a box. But I could read the headline and it said &quot;Swinging Out Over Everyone and Everything. Armistead Maupin is San Francisco's newest celebrity.&quot; And I thought really, look at this, geez. And I couldn't-- And I didn't have any money on me. I was broke at the Glory Holes at three o'clock in the morning. I didn't have a-- I used to think in those days 'cause I was so poor, so I jimmied the rack. I stole that Advocate so I could read about myself. [Robin] And then I went into show business and I became a singer and then a comic. And ABC Television picked us up. I was part of a comedy team named Harrison &amp; Tyler. And we went into Fred Silverman, who's the head of ABC, we went into his office and he said, &quot;we're gonna make you kids stars.&quot; Then we did four pilots and the night that we started Comedy Hour, I did a joke, I did a demonstration and I said, Anita Bryant is to Christianity what paint by numbers is to art. ABC Television, avowed lesbian, you couldn't just be a lesbian, avowed Robin Tyler, you know, called Anita Bryant-- So of course, the networks fired us. I was so happy because then I could come out and do openly lesbian humor. [Ivy] Anita Bryant is urging people to support amendments to take away whatever gay rights gay men had in Florida. They didn't say anything about lesbians. That wasn't in it. It was just gay men. And I don't know what rights they had because I went &quot;Oh God, that's gonna come here, California, next.&quot; And sure enough, two years later... So when Anita Bryant did her thing, we would march, we would protest. I was actually in a delegation that threw a pie in Anita Bryant's face. My lover at the time snapped the shot and I got to write the best headline of all time, &quot;Anita Bryant Gets Her Just Desserts.&quot; -[man] No, no, let him stay, let him stay. -No. [Bryant] Well at least it's a fruit pie. Huh. [Laverne] It's a Gay Life by Donelan started in 1977 and ran for 15 years. The most successful boycott in gay and lesbian history. They were funding right wing groups that were out to destroy every advance that we as gay people had made. They were refusing to hire gay people. Not a single bar in Los Angeles served Coors. Not a single bar in San Diego served Coors. Not a single bar in San Francisco served Coors. So the whole way up the coast. It impacted their business tremendously. I got very involved with Harvey Milk's final campaign and was one of the early organizers against the Briggs Initiative Proposition 6. Up until that time, the gay communities were very, very separate. You could really count on the fingers of one hand the number of activists in each city. Here in California, the Briggs Initiative forced all of these very tiny, small communities scattered around the state from San Diego all the way up to Eureka, to collaborate, to raise funds together, to coordinate our strategies, to fight back against the initiative, which by the way, none of us thought we could beat. And just to be clear what this initiative did, it would've made it law in California that if any child accused their teacher of being gay that that would be the law that they would have to come before the school board and prove they weren't. And if they were found guilty, they lost their teaching certificate and could never teach again. And a group of us, a very small group of us, Reverend Troy Perry, Ivy Boutine, Peter Scott, Diane Abbott, Roberta Bennett, and Harvey up north was with us, but he was doing Northern California. So we were trying to pull statewide campaign where we could raise money because in California, the only way that there was a path to victory, not only was passion and commitment at the grassroots level, but money. But we couldn't get the money and Troy said, &quot;I'll get us the money.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well Troy, how you gonna get us the money?&quot; And he said, &quot;I'm gonna go down to the federal building I'm gonna sit in front of it and I'm not gonna eat a bite until $100,000 comes in.&quot; Now, you have to understand $100,000 is like a million today. On the 17th day, not only did he insist that we have pledges, but the money come in 'cause he knew people wouldn't honor their pledges just to get him to eat. And we started organizing and then we started making a mark. But we couldn't get past that barrier in our polling. And I knew some people on Governor Reagan's staff who were in the closet. And I said, &quot;Would you meet with me?&quot; He said, &quot;What do you want?&quot; And, you know, they were sympathetic. And I said, &quot;I need 15 minutes with the governor.&quot; So Peter Scott and I went in to see Governor Reagan. And I have to tell you, it was one of the most gracious meetings I've had with any politician in my life and I've had a lot. And so we said, &quot;Well, Governor, we're here about Nolan 6,&quot; and clearly he'd been briefed and he said, &quot;Surely they told you I'm probably gonna endorse it.&quot; I said, &quot;They did, but I was shocked.&quot; He said, &quot;David, you couldn't have been shocked that I'm gonna endorse it.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well I was.&quot; I said, &quot;I never thought I'd live long enough to see Governor Reagan support anarchy.&quot; He said, &quot;What do you mean anarchy?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, there's gonna be anarchy in the schools if this passes.&quot; And he leaned over at the desk and he said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, Governor, it says that if a child accuses a teacher of being gay, they must go on trial before the school board.&quot; I said-- And then I said, &quot;I don't know about you, Governor, but I was a pretty big hell raiser in high school and grade school. So if a child was facing a failing grade or had been disciplined by a teacher, or threatened with suspension, I'd just accuse the teacher of being gay and take away my nemesis.&quot; We won the campaign 54, I think 46, I forget the exact percentage. But it put us over the top and it was the first time in history we won at the ballot box. [Laverne] David Goodstein, an investment banker from San Francisco, bought the publication in 1974. He transformed it into a biweekly national news magazine expanding its coverage to GLBT Arts and Culture. We in San Francisco didn't like the magazine then and we didn't like him. So it seemed to us that The Advocate had become sort of a gay Town and Country and we would call it The Avocado. [chuckles] He made it very uncomfortable for owners of establishments that were doing anything less than what was legal and fair. And examples were there was Studio One in West Hollywood which was clearly discriminating against blacks and women. And so I could go there with one ID and if you were black, you'd have to have two. If a women came, there was no open toed shoes. And the paper needed to be cultural, it needed to be sociopolitical and it needed to be everything like sexual in our nature too. David tried to hold on to the pink pages. I mean, he really felt like it was, it was the way that we are made, you know and that why couldn't they be part of a political paper, a social paper. Have I looked at the pink pages? I can't say I never glanced at them, maybe I did. The Advocate had reviews of things like if there was a gay movie, if there was a gay book, if there was like uh-- and if something gay was happening in Minnesota like they were it, they covered it. The Advocate was it. It was a lifeline. [Durk] He went through Est and he liked it. He liked the whole human potential movement concept. But what happened was that he wasn't focused clearly enough to deal with our issues. The number one thing that he focused on was coming out. So everyone, no matter whether you had come out to your parents, whether your parents were alive, whether they were dead, everybody can sit down and write a letter. You never told them, you wanted to tell them. You would never tell them, but you would hope that you could tell them. And so what happens is that then it was very sort of personal. They were in groups and they'd read these letters to each other and there would be a cathartic experience that would happen. [upbeat saxophone music] It was like if you're gonna do this, don't do it with some rag, you know. Do it with the Time Magazine of the gay world. And so we did it. We reached out to The Advocate. It was Adam Vary, he wrote a story that was my coming out story in The Advocate. And I'll never forget. I was so convinced that my whole life would change, that my career was over. But I was willing to risk it all because for the first time in my life I was playing with a full deck of cards. Everything got better. I mean everything improved. That summer, it came out in April and that summer, I had the best ticket sales, I had the best album sales. I was like a free man. I was vibrating on such a high level that everything around me coalesced to just create more. And it was such a wonderful lesson to learn that we all have these mountains of fear and we add to the mountain every day and then you look at it and it's like I can't get on the other side of that mountain of fear. And then you do something so dramatic and radical and you get on the other side and you look back and there's no mountain. It was only after I came out to my mom, which was the hardest coming out that I had to do, and then saw my friends come out to her and tell their stories that I started to understand that that was a real key to creating progress in our community. It was a real-- It created progress in her very quickly. Hearing real stories changed her mind, erased decades, generations of homophobia she'd learned from growing up in the Mormon church, from growing up in the military, in the South, they were gone. Be an actor, leave your private life private. And to me, I felt like private was a great way to disguise the fact that maybe I was lying or maybe I was not standing up for certain things I believed in. When I finally reached the 10th anniversary of my film Mean Girls, a fan wrote me a letter. It started out with &quot;I don't know if you're gay or not and it doesn't really matter, was a sissy chubby kid in middle school and then your movie came out and when I got to be a freshman in high school, the senior girls came over to me and were like come sit with me. You're like Damian. You're the cool gay kid in the school, come sit with us.&quot; I was like it does matter if I'm gay or not. I thought back to the beginning of that letter, I'm like it totally matters. I was there when he told me that he and his partner, Don Bachardy, were gonna be on the cover of The Advocate. Many of their friends, including some very powerful Hollywood folk, but they were saying to Chris and Don, &quot;You've just ruined your career by being on the cover of that magazine.&quot; But they understood as I understood that that was a declaration, that was something you were putting out to the world. You were doing it deliberately so that people didn't have to spend the rest of their lives worrying about whether or not they were ruining their career by telling the truth about themselves. Isherwood always said that a certain arrogance will always get you through. And by that he meant the sense that I'm, don't you tell me I'm not, you know, I'm less than you. Because he knew in his heart that he was better in many ways. Being queer gives you all sorts of ammunition and strength that other people don't have. You just have to learn to use it. But there is something different about tonight. There is something special about tonight. What is different? What is special? I Barbara Jordan am a keynote speaker. Barbara Jordan, when she first came on the scene, and she burst onto the scene nationally in such a big way. I mean she-- Her speech at the Democratic National Convention was galvanizing. And then to find out that she was a lesbian. [Mark] And I remember her giving the most impassioned speech about her belief in the Constitution. This is probably a seminal moment for me because this is what made me decide that, gosh I wanted to do that. We the People. We the People did not include me. And it was only through you know, struggle and hard work and protest and a process of amending the constitution and a civil war, that I was included in We the People. [Robin] There was a gay train where 300 gay men were going and five lesbians that wouldn't talk to them and I said, let's go on the train and every place we stop, -[overlapping speech] -we'll get out like Eleanor Roosevelt and we'll talk and they'll come and they'll see us from all over, and we'll talk about gay rights. We were no Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, were we? [Troy] No, but everywhere that train stopped, all of those gay men and the few lesbians that were on there, jumped off the train and we'd come around with signs and we would all of, the press would announce hundreds of homosexuals met the train. Remember when we got to Utah, clergymen who laid on the tracks and &quot;You devils, you're not welcome here in Utah.&quot; and you remember hundreds of people met us when we got to Washington DC. [Robin] But people were so afraid even to meet the train. [Troy] Yes, even to meet the train for thinking they would end up in a photograph or end up on film. Yes, The Advocate did cover-- [Robin] And they put a reporter on the train to cover the march on Washington. You know, they covered everything. What would we have done without The Advocate? Reverend Perry has fought for marriage equality and for the right to others to define for themselves what marriage and commitment should look like in their own lives since the day he founded MCC. For this and for so much more, I am honored to give you our award. I'm grateful today to stand here in front of you at age 77. And thank you for being there when I needed you 50 years ago for that first ad. And how thankful I am that I've lived to see my City Council Member, who is a gay man, here today. Thank you all. [audience applauds] [reporter] Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot. [gunshots] The police arrested Dan White, a one-time City Supervisor who had resigned and wanted Moscone to reappoint him but he had not agreed to do so. I was actually one of the people who found Harvey's body. The day after, I flew down to Los Angeles to talk to people in the community, in LA about what had happened. It was something else that brought us together. I will never forget walking in and there was the coffin. [Robin] They sentenced Dan White, right, to a very small sentence using the fact that he ate Twinkies and therefore had too much sugar. And so could go and kill, you know, a pro-gay mayor and Harvey. And the next day they rioted of course all over. They had the White Night Riots. They burnt everything down. And Harvey-- the gay parade was coming up, I think, I don't know, a month later. So they called me to MC the gay parade thinking that I could calm the crowd down because it would be a quarter of a million people and whatever, lots, and I would keep, of all the people they called, they called the wrong person. We never [indistinct] gay people, women or men who do not have progressive politics, who have pseudo liberal answers to the political problems facing us and who do not totally and unequivocally defend the gay rights of people in this country. [Harvey] I feel it's important that some people know my thoughts. I stood for more than just a candidate. I have never considered myself a candidate. I have always considered myself part of a movement, part of the candidacy. I wish I had time to explain everything I did. Almost everything was done in eyes of the gay movement. And it's... You know, it's good that we had that experience under our belt of fighting back against the Briggs Initiative and coping with the tragedy of losing Harvey because just a couple of years later, uh, the epidemic began. [typing] [Michael] It all started quietly enough in January of 1981 when I was asked to see a patient on the wards at UCLA, and this patient turned out to be the first patient identified as having AIDS, which of course, we hadn't named at that point. So I was called to see this patient and the patient was a mystery and we had to figure out why this patient had an impaired immune system. And we studied his T cells and found out that the helper cells, or CD4 cells had gone missing. Scientists at the National Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta today released the results of a study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic of a rare form of cancer. And I had a friend who was a nurse, I had a number of lesbian friends who were nurses. And she one day, Suzie is pacing my living room and she says, this is 1981, she says, there's a disease that's killing gay men. She organized all of her lesbian nurse friends, like, they had a little support group of lesbian nurses who talked about whatever lesbian nurses talked about. And she organized them to quit their jobs at other hospitals, quit their jobs at the registry and all go to work at San Francisco General. [reporter] Investigators have examined the habits of homosexuals for clues. I was in the fast lane at one time in terms of the way that I lived my life, and now I'm not. I think that the way certain people lived promoted transmission of it. But it would've been transmitted one way or another. You know, like every disease, every virus gets transmitted no matter who it's-- you know, who it's for. So, obviously, there were more chorus boys who got the virus than nuns. The word was out about what people were calling then the &quot;gay plague&quot; and what was going on. And it was pretty traumatic for all of us in terms of trying to figure out like, here I am trying to figure out who I am and what kind of relationships I want to have with people. And at the same time, you're hearing thousands of rumors about what was going on in New York and San Francisco and how people were trying to address it. And the President of the United States wouldn't even say the word AIDS. He wouldn't even mention HIV or people living with HIV. And then you had this huge, huge, uh, gap of what's going on in healthcare and what's going on in-- with people's lives. The community was not obviously prepared. I don't think any community would necessarily be prepared. Especially a disenfranchised and marginalized communities which, the entire gay community, and certainly, you know, gay people of color or queer people of color. The guys were dying. You know, every week, there'd be one or two funerals. And I said, &quot;I want to put on a town hall meeting. You know, just y'all come.&quot; And there must've been 350 people. Joel Weisman, he said, I want you to meet Michael Gottlieb. It was at UCLA and we went down into the bowels and he said we don't know exactly what's going on but yes, we believe it's sexually transmitted through fluids. [Michael] Well, we published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine in December 1981 and called it pneumocystis pneumonia in previously healthy homosexual men, evidence of a new acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The CDC in the spring of 1982 took those words as the name and it became the acronym AIDS. The scientists say this probably means they are dealing with some new deadly sexually transmitted disease. It hit my population age group first and I saw all my neighbors in this gay neighborhood slowly being decimated. It just changed my life totally. [reporter] Many victims get a rare form of cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. Others get an infection known as Pneumocystis pneumonia. One third have died and none have been cured. Death didn't scare me. It was living with this for a long time. That's more frightening than death. I remember one time at one hospital, Reverend Troy Perry and I were both at the hospital visiting AIDS patients at the same time. And, you know, we met in the hallways. And, you know, he was doing the same thing I was, was ignoring what the doctors were saying and taking the trays and going into the room and feeding the patients, taking off our gloves. Because people with AIDS hadn't been touched by any physical contact. There was such fear and dread and loathing and we would hand feed many of the patients. I remember fighting with one of the big hospitals here in LA with their Chaplain on staff who wouldn't go to visit people with HIV/AIDS. And I had to educate funeral homes in the Jewish community that didn't know how to prepare a body. They were-- Their employees were afraid and they didn't know how to deal with the partners and the loved ones. When you love your child and you have to sit by and watch a disease like this deteriorate the body that you gave birth to, just, you know, rob it, take it. It's just-- It's hard to accept. The day they told me that he had lost his sight in one eye and would be blind in the other in a very short time at 25 years old. And I can remember wanting to cry and not being able to and I couldn't even call anybody. How would they understand what I was feeling? [Michael] So HIV itself was identified in 1983 by the French and then that was confirmed by Dr. Gallo and associates at the National Cancer Institute. And so then people speculated on the origin of HIV. And they focused on this little monkey called the African Green Monkey. Turns out that that monkey was innocent. We ultimately came to understand that the HIV moved into the human species from chimpanzees and gorillas. When I think about The Advocate, I really think about that time when it was the only real source for us to get information that we needed to survive. [Judy] It was another frontline. And we did many things. Tons of articles. We approached many scientists. We followed every possible cure that was supposedly on the horizon. We spoke to Larry Kramer. The people that were rattling the walls and not standing for what was happening. People would disappear. The magazine had to handle a lot of things, medical stuff. And it was amazing to get horrible letters that they could express their hatred, their &quot;God hate a plague that you started&quot;, it was pretty dramatic. One of the things that we did, we created a committee within GLLO, which is Gay and Lesbian Latinos Unidos, and that committee eventually morphed into being the start of Human Services, which is even right now, the largest LGBTQ Latina X organization in the United States. And that really became kind of the center of education and prevention and literature and so forth. What had been a political movement to gain equality for gay people became a movement to save lives. The community had become galvanized by Stonewall and by the Gay Liberation Movement. And so there was an apparatus in place that could start attacking the disease when the mainstream wouldn't attack the disease. And we'd have this routine. We'd go to memorial services, funerals on Saturday morning, and to Studio 54 on Saturday night. And they always would play Thelma Houston's &quot;Don't Leave Me This Way&quot; and Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive&quot; which was sort of our anthems through all of that. Sometimes Sylvester would appear. [Robert] I'm happy to say an NBC groundbreaking drama about AIDS which was just coming out of the closet. An Early Frost was right there with a show that was about the subject. Who else was doing television movies about the AIDS crisis? And it was all told through the point of view of a family dealing with it. It wasn't some polemic about the issue with the government or the disease. It was a family struggling with it. I'm very aware of Steven Carrington and he had fights with his dad about-- and I got to know him and work with him but Aaron Spelling is a sort of legendary TV producer. Made some of the most popular shows in the history of television, one of which was Dynasty. And there was a character on that, in the very first season of the show, Steven Carrington, the son of the, you know, the head of the family. The dad didn't approve of his lifestyle and his choices and all of that and again, shows weren't doing that. So I think that was a seminal character. It is the Stephanie Miller Show, welcome to it. Notice anything different about me? I had professional hair and makeup this morning 'cause the The Advocate is shooting it. It's the 50th anniversary of The Advocate Magazine. Hi. Can I get a gay to live here every morning? [Stephanie] My high school boyfriend died of AIDS. He was the best guy I ever knew. He was my biggest fan and supporter. We thought the reason we didn't have sex in high school is 'cause we were catholic kids. [laughs] We were in college when he told me he was sick. And at the time we were like what does that mean? And he was one of the first guys to get it. You know, we graduated high school in '79, college in '83 and he, um, he had to come out to his family and tell them, you know, he had AIDS at the same time. And I remember his brother was a big football player and he goes AIDS, what are you, a faggot? [Nadia] I was in the hospital visiting a friend by the name of Robert and with my friend Stan. He said, I don't have any reason to go on living. They took my cats away. And Stan and I looked and said, what is it? Well, his parents who were homophobic had taken the cats away. I said, sweetie, you wait here, I'll be back. And Stan and I took his boyfriend, we went to the parent's home, and said &quot;Can we have the cats back for Robert?&quot; And they said, &quot;Well it's all his fault for being there.&quot; I said, &quot;We want the cats back.&quot; And I said, &quot;Alright, if you don't get those cats back in three hours, my boys and I will be back for you.&quot; And we came back three hours, had the cats back. Went to Robert and said, sweetie, you better get your ass out of the hospital and get better because we've got the cats. And Robert went on to live another six months. And he actually died with the cats on his bed. But that night, I just woke up in virtually a cold sweat and went, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; And I phoned Stan, I said, &quot;Stan, we need to do something about that.&quot; That next week, we went to the Hayride, I don't know if you knew about the Hayride, that was a big forum that was happening, a support group for people with AIDS organized by Louise Hay that happened in West Hollywood. So we were a part of that group and we went there and we said, &quot;Louise, we've got an announcement to make.&quot; So we sat next to Louise on our cushion in front of 400 people with AIDS and their friends and we stated what we wanted to happen. We wanted to make something happen so that people living with AIDS could keep their pets and provide whatever was necessary. And that night, everyone said yes and PAWS/LA was born. I came of age during Ryan White, when HIV/AIDS was really coming to the forefront. And I think the way that it affected me initially was fear. At school, we were being taught not to touch the doors of bathrooms and we were being raised with fear. [Laverne] In 1984, Ryan White was infected by the AIDS virus. After failing to be readmitted to school following his AIDS diagnosis, he became a national poster child for HIV/AIDS. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment in December 1984. A thing that school districts around the country were kicking kids out of school, kicking teachers out of school, kicking, uh, school employees that weren't in classrooms out of school and we decided to have hearings with medical people to see what would happen if we didn't do that, if we said &quot;Well this is a medical problem and the medical people in the district and the medical people serving the people who are ill should decide whether it's safe or not safe.&quot; We were the first school district in the country to not have a ban and to have instead a policy. But in '87, huge march because of AIDS, and yes of course The Advocate covered it, even though Time Magazine and Newsweek wasn't there, The Advocate was there. Two guys wanted to get married here from Los Angeles and they called me and asked me if I would produce a wedding ceremony. So I took it to the executive committee of the March. No, we don't need marriage. Nobody wants to get married. -[Troy] Oh I remember. -Do you remember that? And except for PFLAG. And so I said-- -[Troy] And Troy Perry. -Yeah right, Troy Perry and Peter. And so I right away called the boys and I said, I just brought it up with the March committee and they'd love to do it. [chuckles] And we put on a huge wedding ceremony and you and Phillip came and spoke. And that was the first mass wedding ceremony. -[Troy] In front of the IRS. -In front of the IRS building and thousands of gay and lesbian couples came out to get married. How you spoke and how they were crying and how they were hugging and this became, like, known as &quot;The Wedding&quot;, the first mass same sex marriage demonstration. I'm Bryant Gumble. This week on Today, we look to the AIDS fear and at attempts to quarantine patients. [Laverne] Lyndon LaRouche argued that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria by way of casual contact and insect bites. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants or healthcare and quarantining those who tested positive. This would've thrown HIV positive men into concentration camps, unheard of for the time. And we formed groups to fight this ridiculous initiative. We defeated Proposition 64 by a huge margin. And I think that that was a surprise and a wake-up call for the community, number one about our power and number two understanding that we had allies if we just would call upon them and to hold them accountable. Previously, you know, the LGBT community was involved as political donors and it was very weird because our organizations and individuals would give money to elected officials but the elected officials had no, there was no expectation that they would even acknowledge that they were actually getting money, getting donations from the LGBT community. And I remember [indistinct] really being angry about that. And she, like, publicly saying that if you're gonna take our money, you're gonna at least have to acknowledge that we gave you money. And we have expectations for the support we give. And I remember Jenny's quote was &quot;No more free fucks&quot;. And we decided to create the LGBT Victory Fund which would raise early money, and not only raise the money, but since we've never been allowed, literally allowed, in many states to run for office, do training institutes that teach 'em how to raise money, how to do media, how to spend money, how to campaign, how to do filings, how to do a press release. And we refused to endorse anybody that didn't go through that institute and they had to prove to us they were viable. We had kind of a radical analysis. We understood. We also brought those organizing [indistinct] of protest marches from the women's movement, from the anti-Vietnam War movement. There were a few men, gay men who came out of the social movements of the '60s, but there were many more lesbians. The men who I knew who became the leaders in Act Up or the leaders in the LGBT movement at the time in the '80s and '90s were men who faced discrimination for the first time in their lives like my friend Steve Kolzak, who was, you know, head of casting for Paramount. He was a bigwig in Hollywood. He used to say, &quot;I'm the Harvard golden boy. I never met an obstacle. I didn't have-- suffer homophobia. I was-- I ran-- you know, I rose through the ranks in Hollywood.&quot; But the minute he got AIDS, he was fired. We're not talking about illiterate people. We're talking about senators and congressmen and the fucking president. [audience cheering] I just want to hear how &quot;How long?&quot; is gonna sound when you scream it at Mr. Reagan. On three, please. Would you do that for me? One, two, three. [Crowd] How long? [Michael] Yeah, the Reagan administration had its major issues with HIV, with the communities affected by AIDS. And I was there when Reagan said the word AIDS for the first time and it was Elizabeth Taylor who prompted him to do it in Washington in 1987. Six years into this epidemic. By the time Rock was ill and announced that he had AIDS, really 3,000 or 4,000 people had died of the disease. It was still kind of a minor blip in the public consciousness. And he did a lot to create awareness of AIDS. Every single drug that's out there for people with HIV is there because of Act Up. Period, end of statement. We taught ourselves everything. We knew more than the other side. We were united. We had good cops going inside to negotiate and we had bad cops outside protesting. Pretty scared, but being HIV positive I don't have much choice in the matter. And I'm doing this for everybody I know and for myself. That's all I have to say. I was very close to joining Act Up. [Michael] It was just so incredibly frustrating and it was basically a state of war. You had to put your body on the sidewalk and get the attention of people in Washington. People were dying. The administrators and legislators were not visiting the wards that were filled with 30 people with various stages of immune deficiency and opportunistic infections. And they were not witnessing the fact that this was devastating and very sad. Patients who sat there on the exam table and who so much wanted to live and just looked at me and I-- back in the day, when we didn't have these medicines, I just felt so helpless, so impotent. And I just had nothing left. [Laverne] In Washington DC, a group of people brought the ashes of their loved ones who had died of AIDS. They stood in rows. They passed out their ashes. Eventually, they were all arrested. My brothers are dying and we didn't have any organization or anything to pull together. So The Catch became that, in addition to a place where they could go home. We were like a clearing house you know, where folks would call or come by in search of people that they had lost contact, loved ones that they had lost contact with. Several times we were able to reunite folks with their people or families before they did pass on. At that time, I think The Advocate probably fluctuated between, around 30 full time employees, You know, 28, 35, over those years, just depending covering editorial advertising, circulation, accounting, et cetera. I did a count just earlier last week. I remembered that there were about 20, 20 people, full time staff that died during that ten year period. So a staff of 30, and we lost 20 of them. It was really a very, very difficult time. So, I had the school district office write up a brochure on all the ways you could get AIDS and all the ways that you couldn't. Um, and they bogged down when they came to wanting to know whether I really wanted them to describe anal sex. And I said, &quot;Well, let's put it this way, isn't that the most likely way people will get it?&quot; When I arrived at The Advocate, it was a very dramatic and difficult time. We were dealing with AIDS. It was the early '90s. We had a new president, President Clinton, which at first seemed wonderful. At least he said the word gay. But there was a lot going on and it affected me personally in my job. AIDS sent us into an era of outing people. Outing people was a different kind of thing then. You weren't just trying to do it to ruin their lives or some kind of prank or some nasty thing. It was being done because there was a whole population of people who had power and had a voice and they were closeted and they were ignoring the movement and doing nothing to help it. And for those who were being so terribly affected by it, they were furious. And so one of the things that became really, really important was to try to get people to come out. Many people kept her at arm's length when she approached them and tried to do a profile on them, for instance. That's the quickest way to find out where the closet is is to be a journalist. And then the PR people come up to you and say, &quot;She doesn't want to talk about that and we'll leave if you talk about that or you even ask the question.&quot; And that gets to be tiresome after a while when you're trying to tell the truth about gay life. [Denise] The last time it was shown altogether in Washington DC, in '93 at that March on Washington, we took a contingent of people on the solemnity of just seeing all of the quilts together spread over the National Mall and finding the ones we had worked on. That was a really meaningful and transformative moment. On Tuesday nights, the sewing machines would come out and there would be 40 or 45 of us working on quilts. One for every member of the synagogue that died of HIV/AIDS for that NAMES Project Quilt. And those were both painful and they were both healing. The methodical way we would stitch-- hand stitch certain parts of their quilt and other parts. I mean, I know people learned how to use a sewing machine from those years. And then AZT came along and I was chairing a session at the antiviral meeting in Minneapolis when I saw the first data on AZT in the test tube. And I was really impressed. Ultimately was allowed to be part of the large national clinical trial that compared AZT to placebo in which the patients who got AZT did marginally better than the people on placebo. And that led to the approval of AZT. Of course, AZT has a reputation but my point about the drug is that it was a proof of principle. It gave pharma the impetus to move ahead and companies to study drugs that might work because they perceived there was a market. And I would point out that there are no HIV drugs that were developed in any economy other than a capitalist economy. [Greg] And so I reached out to a friend of mine, Robbie Brown, and I told him I want to write a book and he said, &quot;Oh my god, I've got the perfect person for you. I've got to introduce you to Eric Marcus.&quot; And so he introduced me to Eric Marcus. His first question to me was &quot;Okay, in 1988, you hit your head on the board. What was going on in your head?&quot; &quot;Six months prior to the '88 Olympic Games, I was diagnosed as being HIV positive and they wanted to treat me very aggressively so they put me on AZT right away.&quot; And then he started sobbing. And I didn't understand that. You know, once he calmed down, I said, why did you react that way? Because AZT is incredibly toxic. And any of his friends that were on it, didn't tolerate it or if they tolerated it, they didn't tolerate it well. And he said, &quot;And you won two Olympic gold medals on AZT.&quot; It challenged us in a new way and gay communities around the country which in previous years would have been very sorely challenged to raise even 10 or $20,000 were suddenly raising and spending millions of dollars to address the needs of people who were very sick and dying. So you saw the birth of AP AIDS Project Los Angeles and the Shanti Project both in San Francisco and LA and then eventually New York. And support groups. I know I started a support group in my congregation. [Michael] We got hope with the Vancouver Conference in 1996 when the triple combination cocktail was announced. And we saw that you could suppress a viral load undetectable. That offered a whole lot of hope. And that was just a joyous time. But I must say that gay men were absolutely awesome. They shook down the medical people in our political world until they got themselves some kind of cure. And if it hadn't been for the revolution that happened in 1995, '96 with the protease inhibitors, I might not have been able to stay in the field because the rate of dying from the period time '81 to '95 was just so awful. And by then I was a wreck. That was hard as you sort of worried a little bit just about-- Yeah. Long term survivors with HIV have a post traumatic stress condition. They thought they were gonna die and then they lived. This was hard for everybody who lived through it. [Laverne] We soon found a place on TV. A place that could assist in changing the hearts and minds of America. It was a show called Will &amp; Grace. The world embraced it, which was the first great thing about it because it was funny. It was really funny and really intelligent and had a big heart also. Right behind that was the fact that the main-- the title character was a gay man which had never happened before. A gay man and his best friend. You know, it was just kind of the way things were. There was not a lot of soap box speechifying about it. And at the same time, I think every episode had some element of you know, you've never seen the story told this way before. And then you had Jack which was just a fun, crazy and sometimes criticized more &quot;stereotypical&quot; you know &quot;gay character&quot;. It kind of reset the table for comedy. Nothing had ever happened like this in comedy before. The country kind of went wild in a good way. There was a lot of political discourse about it. There was negative stuff from the right about it. There were also kids and young people writing letters to the cast saying, &quot;I've never seen a character like this, this is me, on television before.&quot; Sean Hayes has gotten letters from kids who were suicidal who decided not to commit suicide, not necessarily because of Will &amp; Grace, but I think that being in the world contributed to making the world an easier place for a gay, closeted young person to live. So, I think the many upsides of that show, I can't even list them all. The good news is they all love each other and they love doing the show. And, uh, you know, everybody came back. It's the same crew, it's the same director, it's the same, you know, craft service people, it's the same editors. It's literally the same family of people that made the show originally. Whether it was fighting Anita Bryant or Dr. Laura, 'cause she was part of that fight too, pushing marriage decades before others or joining the resistance movement today as she has, Robin Tyler is a grassroots activist who proves that with the support and gumption, you can go from being a broke little baby butch on the streets of New York City to a badass old broad who has literally changed the world. [audience applauds] Thank you very much. I'd like to thank my producer, my director. -Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the Tony's. -[laughter] Passion is always better than Prozac and love is far more sustaining. So our community can set the example for everybody else and say &quot;Look what it's like. We're coming from the right to love&quot;, and-- and eventually the haters will drop by the side. But it's gonna be quite a challenge for us. Luckily, we have gay youth coming up, LGBT youth like this, but we still don't have the right to work in 32 states. But it's been one hell of a life. Thank you very much. And thank you for The Advocate for producing our wedding. Thank you. [audience applauds] I think I change people's perceptions just by educating them and letting them know that I'm just like they are. It was never a decision for me to be gay. This is who I am, this is how I was born. I had an officer that wrote me a letter just recently who said that he used to hate gays, used to hate everything that was different than him. And I trained him at the Academy. I was his physical training sergeant at the Academy and he wrote me a letter saying that I changed the way that he thinks about everybody, mostly gay people because of how I encouraged him and how I, um, really fought for him to be successful at the Academy. And it was a huge turning point for him in his life. And it's a letter that I will cherish always because if I can affect one persons' life to help them see that we are all one large community, whether you're gay, straight, bi, whatever, um, it's important that we all be able to live harmoniously together. As Harvey Milk said, &quot;Come out, come out, wherever you are&quot;, and my view is everybody who comes out who is safe in coming out, physically safe, come out, come out, wherever you are, because that's really what has changed America. You know, I wanted to join the fight kind of like The Advocate. In some ways-- You know, it's time to stop cheerleading from the sidelines and get down on the field. Given what I do for a living, I thought, you know, I realized how powerful now it is to not just say I'm for that, but I am that. -[Belinda] Remember the temper tantrum you-- -[Duke] Over Brokeback Mountain? When you couldn't go to Brokeback Mountain on Saturday. I think we had to move it to Sunday and I thought hmm. So when you told me, &quot;Mom, I like boys&quot; -And you pulled over... -I had to pull over, even though as you know, you've growing up with my friends and most of them -are gay and lesbian. -So did that mean that you didn't ever seriously -contemplate it up until then? -Yeah, but when you actually said it, it was still shocking. I mean, it's still shocking even though I had sort of hints along the way. Even though really at the end of the day it doesn't really matter. Most important parts of the LGBT community is our children. Both those we've raised in our homes, the ones we've adopted and had by surrogacy and had or had from a former marriage, a heterosexual marriage that we had, and also our children that are growing up in homes across the world who will come out one day. And they're coming out earlier and earlier. But I do think we have a special responsibility to all of them to continue to build the institutions of our queer community, to continue to create safe space for our young people to explore who they are in healthy ways. And, you know, many of us remember the struggles of what it was to come out in hostile places where we were thrown out of our homes or kicked out, where our families rejected us. And I think the LGBT community has a special responsibility to love up our children and to show them that we can lead healthy, integrated, psychologically, emotionally, physically, spiritual lives, to be contributing members to society, and to continue not only to fight for our rights and responsibilities, but those of others. We got the beautiful opportunity to be in the delivery room with our birth mother. I really wanted that same thing with my daughter. And Gabe, my husband, is very squeamish. So he definitely wanted to be up with the birth mother helping her in the process. So I got to be there when Alaria popped out and I was the first person she saw in the universe. And, you know, I tried to imbue that moment with as much love and warmth and welcome and joy as you can. You know, there's nothing more beautiful than that first instinct and she popped open her eyes, and there I was. Connor Franta has millions of followers now across all kinds of social media. Twice been on the New York Times bestsellers list for A Work in Progress and Note to Self. So I wanted to introduce Connor Franta and award him with our Innovator's Award. [audience applauds] A lot of you I don't think know much about me. I'm a child of the Internet so, hi, what's up? Came to accept the fact that I'm gay. So, I uploaded a video to YouTube and was absolutely nervous, shaking in my boots and I uploaded the video and within 24 hours it had amassed like 8 million views and like 500,000 likes and had like four trending topics on Twitter. And it was the worst thing in the world [chuckles] 'cause you hide this secret for not as long as I'm sure some of you hid it. I hid it for 21 years of my life, which is still a really long time, um, and then to have everyone know it all at once was absolutely terrifying. I'm just now realizing today that YouTube was to me what The Advocate was and is to so many other people. YouTube was a platform which I could connect and see other people in the community and I could feel less alone, which is what The Advocate has been doing for an amazing 50 years. And I'm sure it helped a lot of other people feel less alone in the world. And everyone seems to always want to tell you that being different is bad, but over just 24 years of my life I've come to realize that different is the best thing that you can be. So I just want to thank you all. You all are very inspirational. I feel like I could cry right now, I don't know why. [laughs] So I wanted to thank The Advocate. You guys are amazing, you guys are doing great things. Thank you for 50 years. Here's to 50 more and thank you for honoring me today. [audience applauds] [Laverne] Don't ask, don't tell was the official United States policy on military service by gays, bisexuals and lesbians instituted by the Clinton Administration on February 28, 1994, lasting until September 20th, 2011. This was the compromise that President Clinton felt would help the LGBTQ military, but ended up turning it into a witch hunt. People would come up to me and say, &quot;You deserve to be fired. Nobody outed you, nobody blackmailed you, nobody witch-hunted you.&quot; I wonder if they understand what they're saying because the worst part of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is not being outed, is not being witch-hunted. The worst part of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is that it enforces the closet and that it enforces shame. [David] Rand Schrader, he was newly appointed as one of the first two openly gay judges in the state of California and he was one of the early supporters and founders of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center. We were together for ten years until he died of AIDS in 1993. And I became acutely aware that I had no rights or protections as any kind of legal spouse. This was way before domestic partnerships, way before civil unions and I thought again, this has got to be my life's work to ensure that we have the same basic rights and privileges as everyone else in society. If you can marry someone, you can be covered under their insurance. If you can marry someone, you can die of HIV or anything else without having the estranged families of your partner, your spouse, swoop in and take everything away from you. The house that you shared, the property that you owned. We saw that happen. There was a conflict within the movement. I literally talked to heads of organizations and I would push about the stories about marriage and why can't we get marriage and what are you doing about marriage and they would say, &quot;Too soon. Let's just keep this, get our rights, with-- our civil rights another way. Marriage is just too big a thing.&quot; That was an issue they didn't want to take on. But we tried in our congregation to educate the importance of what it means to protect and love our families legally. Not civil unions because it's not marriage. And when that word means something, not only to the individuals in the marriage, but to those of their family and friends and how we are treated and it means something legally. [Gavin] We have George W. to thank for those marriages in 2004 in San Francisco having gone to Washington DC and the privilege of being given a ticket to listen to the State of the Union, Nancy Pelosi's husband decided to skip it and I was up there in the rafters listening to his speech talking about abstinence, talking about drug testing, talking about steroid abuse. This was after the perfunctory comments around Iraq. And by the way, those were literal things that were in the remarkable speech. And then the final page of that speech was the support, the public support that had been privately rumored, but now publicly stated in support of a constitutional amendment to support marriage between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;. I remember two people as if it was yesterday, this couple that were sitting there waxing on about how proud they were of their president and what an extraordinary speech it was. And I was sort of looking over curiously at them. And then they said those fatal words, at least in my mind. They said, &quot;Boy, we're just so proud he's taking on the 'homosexual' agenda.&quot; Got on that cell phone and called my chief of staff and said, &quot;Did you hear the speech?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said, &quot;We gotta do something about it.&quot; And he goes, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; And literally that was the spark, that moment. [Laverne] Mayor Gavin Newsom, at a civil rights demonstration, married Phyllis Lion and Del Martin, paving the way for the City and the County of San Francisco to begin issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples. Unknowingly, the same day, Gloria Allred was on the steps of Beverly Hills City Hall having a news conference. [Gloria] The mayor, even though he had very good intentions, there's no way that would be upheld. It would have to be a case that we had announced we would bring to actually challenge that family code section. Robin had invited me on Freedom to Marry Week to witness her and Diane going to Beverly Hills Courthouse to get a license to marry. They knew that they would be denied. But I'm not the kind of person who just likes to witness injustice. I like to do something about it. We held a news conference on the steps of the courthouse. I said, &quot;If they are denied this license today, we're going to file a lawsuit challenging that family code ban because we think they should have the right to marry.&quot; Well, they were denied it. We were the first to announce that we would do it. We did it. [Laverne] Gloria Allred won the lawsuit, so Robin Tyler and Diane Olson were allowed to marry making it legal for same sex marriages in California. This door's wide open now. [Laverne] In response, Proposition 8 was created, a voter referendum to amend the State Constitution to recognize marriage only as being between one man and one woman. [reporter] Acceptance of gay marriage is now mandatory. That changes a lot of things. People sued over personal beliefs, churches could lose their tax exemption. Gay marriage taught in public schools. [announcer] We don't have to accept this. Whether you like it or not-- You know, Proposition 8 pushed marriage equality to the forefront. All of a sudden, there was this great energy around passing marriage equality. And then marriage equality for all. [Chad] When Prop 8 passed in California, that election of 2008 was historic because of Barack Obama had just become the president of the United States and made history and I knew would make further history on our issues. Um, but at that same time, a vote of the people in what was supposed to be the most progressive state in the country had voted to take away the freedom to marry in this state. All of us came together asking &quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot; And that led to a series of discussions and meetings and a group of philanthropists and activists came together and decided to file a federal challenge to Proposition 8 here in California and we hired Ted Olson on the republican side and David Boies on the democratic side to create a bipartisan dream team to try to take down Proposition 8. This particular case, neither Governor Schwarzenegger or Attorney General Jerry Brown believe that Prop 8 is constitutional. They don't intend to defend it. In fact, they both agree, Republican and Democrat, that gay and lesbian couples should start to marry immediately. We're confident that the decision is a very thorough decision and we'll be able to get through the Ninth Circuit as quickly as possible. The whole Prop 8 campaign was built on lies and misrepresentations of our community, who we were. And the whole idea was to reduce the amount of equality and access to rights when all we wanted to was be participants in equality and the rights that everyone else had. So by telling our stories and fighting against Proposition 8, we met amazing people who have brought us together with a great team to say, &quot;Listen, the law is black and white and you should go to court and you should fight for your rights in this country. It's the backbone of our country. It's the constitution.&quot; But we also had to move hearts and minds in the public arena as well. And by doing so, we just continued to tell our stories, to share our love, not to be afraid to tell people who we are and why we love each other. And that made all the difference. [reporter] Walker stated: We try to use these photos as a way to create dialogue. For us, it was a way to explain to people how we felt when Proposition 8 passed here in California. Why we felt silenced and why we had the tape on our mouth and what &quot;no hate&quot; meant, how it made us feel. Gay, straight, black, white, it didn't matter who you are, we wanted to show people we're different and came from all backgrounds. Everyone supported this issue and everyone who's being discriminated against. So this is something that was important to us and this is something that's important to the campaign, showing that it affects everyone and it includes everyone. When we were awaiting the Supreme Court decision on Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act led by the heroic Edie Windsor, who we were all so sad to have lost, the Supreme Court kept putting it off and putting it off, putting it off and then we finally had the date in June that it was going to be announced. And many of the people involved in the case were going to be in Washington DC for the reading of the decisions. I was producing I Am Harvey Milk, Andrew Lippa's incredible consort opera about the life of Harvey. All these spectacular timing things always happen around Harvey. So it actually-- I was like of course. Final concert of I Am Harvey Milk, the world premiere, was on Friday night. Friday morning, I get a call from Adam Umhoefer who was Executive Director of the American Federation for Equal Rights and he said, &quot;You're in San Francisco. Get to the courthouse now.&quot; The state had said &quot;We're making a big announcement at 5 p.m.&quot; We had arranged for Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, the two female plaintiffs, to be the first new LGBT people to get married again in California in San Francisco and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo to get married by Antonio Villaraigosa at City Hall in Los Angeles if it happened. So everyone's racing to their cities and Chad Griffin and Lance Black are flying to California. And I called the director of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. There's a beautiful song called &quot;San Francisco&quot; in I Am Harvey Milk, which is an ode to San Francisco and how it's been a haven for LGBT people through the generations. Get the chorus to the steps of City Hall to sing San Francisco. We get the call at five o'clock. It's a go. The marriages are happening right now. Kamala Harris, who was the Attorney General of California at the time, she had been a strong ally of ours. She had been the one behind the scenes pushing to get marriages happening. But that week, she races down from her office, she's gonna marry Chris and Sandy and we go into the City Clerk's office and they're signing the papers, we're weeping, no one can believe this is happening. Kamala's standing right there and she gets a call and there's confusion in Los Angeles. They put her on with the clerk and she says, &quot;This is Kamala Harris. I'm the Attorney General of the State of California. Those marriages are to start now.&quot; [Laverne] Proposition 8 was overturned on August 4th, 2010. [Gloria] Any member of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community, and I don't even have time to go into all the transgender cases I've done is we have to fight for it. Joyous, just joyous. [Laverne] Edie Windsor was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court of the United States case US V. Windsor. We'd successfully overturned Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, and was considered a landmark legal victory for same sex marriage. The realities of changing times. Upon learning that the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of Edie Windsor, what I said to the journalist who asked me how I felt, I felt jubilation, I felt fabulous and that I felt every gay word I can think of. [Jeremy] Having had many proud days working for you, this is truly probably the proudest day of my life. My voice, I could tell was starting to crack and I was-- didn't want to get, you know, be a crying idiot there in The Blue Room. And the President put his hand on my shoulder and he goes, &quot;Well, you know how I have felt for years, you know where I was, and I was gonna say something next week and that damn Biden--&quot; And he was joking, but you also got to seriously think that Biden had said something before and kind of joked and he jokingly was saying, &quot;that damn Biden&quot; and we-- and we were laughing and it gave a nice relief. Both the Obamas hugged me and told me how much they loved me and how much this was for them an amazing moment. I don't think I'll ever forget that. She's sort of like an explainer. She explains the world to me and really creates empathy in a way that I hadn't experienced before. So for that I want to present to Kat Blaque our Innovator Award. I am very honored to be in a room with so many historic people. I feel awkward being included into that group, but thank you for having me. When I read these old stories of trans people, they would be these stories that basically you had to pass. You had to pass, you had to survive and ultimately the goal was to be stealth. So, you know, once you got your doctor's recommendation, you know, you started your hormones, you got the surgery, and you killed your entire family and you moved to another state. [laughing] Then, then you can finally start living life. And so my YouTube journey, without the killing my family part, was basically that. You know, was me coming from being this young queer kid to towards the end of my college this, you know, passing trans woman. So graduating college I went out to real world. If someone knew that I was trans, they wouldn't want to hire me, you know. Stealth for a lot of trans people is all about survival. After I got to that point of, uh, you know, my post stealth life, I started to feel very comfortable in it, I started to not think about it. But then my YouTube channel started to become more successful. I got so many emails and phone calls from people that were like, &quot;Oh my god, I didn't know that you were trans.&quot; But, you know, it was this weird thing of like oh god, this thing I was so afraid of happening had happened and you know what, I looked around, the world was still there, I was still cute. -Nothing, you know... -[audience clapping] Nothing happened. And that's when I really started to change. Thank you so very much for everything, really. [audience applauds] [Candis] When I started my transition in '95, the T was still not even in the LG and B. And it took probably five or six more years to even add us to the community. Not that I ever felt not a part of the community, but I used to go every week, four times a week, to bars in Chelsea in New York City during my transition and tell my entire audience what was going on, what was happening to me, the stories about transitioning, the medical care, the lack of medical care, all these crazy things that happened to me on a daily basis because I really wanted to bridge the gay community and the trans community together because they were so segregated. So for me, when they finally added the T to the LG and B, it was-- it was a major day for our community. And I don't think people understand that. But I always had the knowledge that we still live in a nation where you can still be fired or kicked out of your home legally for being an LGBTQ person. That trans people's lives are literally in danger daily. You know, and not being protected. And in fact, the few protections we have are being rolled back now. My journey of being a trans woman or becoming who I am today um, has not been easy. I have experienced many different challenges in my life. Many challenges that young people are even experiencing today. I have survived homelessness, I have survived drug addiction, I've survived the prison industrial complex. I was incarcerated in the state penitentiary for about 14 years of my life here in California. I have been in immigration detention multiple times. I have been sexually abused. I have been beaten up. I have overdosed and left for death in alleys. I have been chased out of neighborhoods. I have been beaten up and raped by the police in Mexico. So all of those experiences um, that I have overcome I have been able to, um, overturn those experiences into opportunities. I am the CEO of the Trans Latino Coalition. But my definition of a CEO is Community Elevated Officer. You know, I live my best life every day as an out, proud trans woman unapologetically which for me is a revolutionary act. I try to get on the blow horn and speak about marginalized folks, um, people of color, gender nonconforming, anybody who has lived on the fringe basically, that's who I'm rooting for. [Cher] There's so many feelings that come up, you know, and most of them are difficult. I still have a problem with pronouns. And-- and you go through a lot of changes just as Chaz was going through whatever her changes were, I was going through my changes too. I remember one time I called and the answering machine, she obviously had forgotten to change her answering-- voicemail and I thought &quot;Oh my god, that's probably the last time I'm gonna ever hear the voice that I've known my whole life.&quot; So there are things that are small things that you just take for granted. And then you have to know, you know like, it took a long time for me to know well, this is just the same person I've known my whole life. I didn't transition till I was 65. I had raised my children, wonderful kids, they were out into the world. I was back in Malibu all by myself and thinking what the hell am I gonna do with my life? Am I gonna sit our here and rot? I couldn't do it back in the '80s. I had six years in there from like '84 to 1990 that things were really tough. I mean, I basically secluded myself from the world. I didn't fit in anywhere, so I just stayed in the house. This issue had moved forward since the '80s. Um, we had other people that were out there, the Laverne Cox, Janet Mock, the Geena Rocero, other people who had come forward and brought this issue forward and I thought, you know what, my last conversation was kind of in my heart and my soul to say, maybe this is the reason God put me on this Earth in this time, in this place, to come forward, live my life authentically 'cause you can't do this unless you know it's the right thing to do in your heart, and add my voice to the conversation. [DeRay] You know, Mike Brown got killed August 9th, 2014 and I was sitting on my couch in Minneapolis and it was like one o'clock in the morning and I was just like, I'm gonna go. So I got in the car, drove nine hours, ended up in Ferguson and that was the beginning of my story. I went initially because I just wanted to see with my own eyes what was happening, and stayed like so many other people to fight for justice. When I think about protest, I think about this idea of telling the truth in public. That means our bodies tell the truth, that Mike [indistinct] be alive. And so much of the act over the past three years has been about forcing people to confront truths that they would otherwise not. I think that one of the things the movement has done is just pushed people to have public conversation about things that they otherwise-- that there was just not language and space. So obviously around police and criminal justice. But a corollary happened to be sort of identity. I remember the early days in the street is there was all these queer people and women and men coming together in a coalition that we had to because we were just trying to get to tomorrow at that point. And people figured out how to coexist in space and love each other and be together. And it also made us confront these complex things about identity. But we were suddenly doing it in public because we were doing it on Twitter, or we're doing it on Instagram, we're doing it in these really public ways. So I think that the way we talk about the trans community in public is so different than it was three years ago. The way that we talk about being gay or what it means to fight for justice and what coalitions look like is just so different. I'm also mindful that the Civil Rights Movement was a decade long worth of activism, right? That we're in year three of having people sort of woke in this way. So I know that change doesn't come overnight, that this is the long haul. Black Lives Matter is walk a mile in my shoes. The answer to Black Lives Matter is not All Lives Matter. It's because when you see something from a black perspective, it's just different. Yes, I know every life matters, but it's not all of us that's being shot down by others. And not only is it with police shootings. African American women lose their child at childbirth two to one versus white women. Almost any way you cut it, their lives has not mattered as much as ours have in society. And it's not militant, it's not radical concept. It's just people saying, &quot;We want to live.&quot; To make that chant &quot;Gay, straight, black, white, same struggle, same fight&quot; true, not just a good rhyme, I want to see more visible LGBTQ people at Black Lives Matter marches and not just 'cause it's the right thing to do or the PC thing to do. It's also the politically strategic thing to do for both of our groups is to work together. We have to. And it will make us a better people. We are our brother's keepers. [Robin] A lot of times, we've talked about the past today, but I don't live in the past. I basically think about today and what needs to be done. People always say when you're older you should pass the torch. If you pass the torch, you're standing in the dark. So I think if you're older, you should light somebody else's torch, but you should never give away your light because you can fight till the end of your life and I intend to. [Troy] I live in the present, never the past. I remember the past, but I don't live in it. I'm not one of those people who are gonna wallow in the past. I'm selfish. I tell people sometimes, a lot of what I did was for me. In other words, in helping others it was still about me because I just wanted to know that I was treated like every other citizen in this country. No more, but I'll be damned if I would settle for any less. [Robin] Passion is the ultimate drug. Passion is better than Prozac. Passion keeps you alive. We did a roll call on who thinks we should fold The Advocate for financial reasons and everyone raised their hand, myself included and I've been working with the brand for 20 years. It was a very difficult call for me to make. And after that meeting, Paul stood up and said, absolutely not. [Laverne] In 2008, Here Media purchased The Advocate and under the leadership of CEO Paul Colichman, transformed the brand into a digital powerhouse. I am so lucky and so grateful because I get to work with the best team in journalism every day. And I'd actually like them all to come up for a moment. All, come on in. I want to bring up my buddy David. [audience applauds] All these amazing people and our amazing guests, thank all of you so much for your passion and your dedication, for your love of justice, for how you look at every obstacle and say, &quot;It's not an obstacle, it's just something I'm going over.&quot; Our job is to make sure that for the next 50 years, we document our history and our culture because you can't let other people define who you are. You must define yourself. If you let someone be in charge of your history, you've given up your soul. And so to you young people, we pass the baton. It's now your job. We're gonna give it to you and to our founders, we send you our love, our respect and our unending gratitude. [upbeat music] When I told my mom I was gonna be on the cover of The Advocate she goes, &quot;Oh my god, there's nothing more major than that.&quot; I'm very happy and very proud to be part of it. Thank you. And guess what? I think my dogs are gay too. We need to say thank you for everything that you do for us. What if we do it in Spanish? Give it a thought, food for thought. [chuckles] Thank you, bye, bye. Always in awe of all that you do and continue to do. Thank you. I've been reading the magazine for a really long time and years ago I did a film called Stonewall and you guys wrote a piece on it and it was just, you know I was first just coming out of the closet myself and you guys were super supportive. There weren't that many publications out there that had people like myself, you know, gay folks, so thank you for being there and making me feel included. Thank you. It is my honor to kick off this historic day. This is a momentous occasion for we are united... [Darryl] Life is still worth living. There's still a lot of beauty in the world and the things that separate us, we could also be celebrating our differences and learning more about other people. I mean that's kind of what this country's supposed to be about. ♪ Oh say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ [Roland] You know we're queer, we can do any of that. We can imagine nationally power. The world is ready for a queer point of view even if they don't know it. [Dave] I love being part of this community. I'm very proud of is being small piece of the puzzle, this vast, beautiful, colorful puzzle. We've come way too far, we're not going back. Anything you do, radical, volunteer on a phone, do whatever, but it's gotta be you doing it. [DeRay] And I think about hope is a belief that our tomorrows can be better than our today's and that is what keeps me in the fight every day. It's what I know changes communities and it's what I know can change the world. You've got to manifest it. The future's not in front of you, it's inside of you. It's our decisions, at the end of the day, not conditions that determine our fate and determine our future. And I think what The Advocate is all about is we can shape the future. And so I'm absolutely confident and optimistic about the future as long as we're vigilant. As long as we recognize there's still extraordinary amount of work to do, laws to be changed, but also more importantly perhaps, minds to be changed and hearts ultimately to be changed. [Gloria] We have to fight for our rights. Each and every one of us, every day in every way that we can that is legal and peaceful. Sometimes not so peaceful. And I am honored to be part of this battle. And I will continue to be for the rest of my life and if possible, from the great beyond as well. ♪ Brave ♪ -[upbeat music] -[audience cheering] -You are beautiful. -[Crowd cheering] You are beautiful.

There's no lesbian equivalent to Grindr. The closest thing we have, Animal Rescue. [woman] I'm excited to be here for the Resist March. It's an incredible day. Just walking over and seeing so many people out there really standing up for rights, our freedom and our democracy. It's really incredible. This time that many people are very frightened, and I myself am very frightened for my community, for my country and for the planet. But there've been so many times in my life when I thought it was over, when I thought everything was over. I thought my life was over before it began when I was just 15 and getting ready to kill myself. I came to this city and I met Harvey Milk and he was like a dad. He was my leader, he was my hero and when I found his body, I thought it was all over, but it wasn't over. And then AIDS came and killed all my friends, I made new friends and they died. Then I made new friends and they died and I thought it was over so many times. But it wasn't over. We grew stronger despite all the misery around us. And then I got sick and I almost died and I thought, &quot;Well, you're done, it's over now.&quot; But Act Up stormed the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration and got the medicine released that saved my life. It wasn't over. When I watched the election results on television I thought to myself &quot;Well, it's over now.&quot; And then that night we marched here in San Francisco, thousands and then tens of thousands and we were gay and straight and young and old and black and brown and white and we were marching together and I felt strong. It's not over. I hope people understand that they are going to be called upon to fight in a way that I think the younger generation has not yet personally experienced. We're going to have to fight very hard to defend what we've gained and to move forward as a people. I think we're up to that challenge. We are here and we are queer and we ain't going nowhere.
