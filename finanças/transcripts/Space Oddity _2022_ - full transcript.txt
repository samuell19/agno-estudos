[shower running] [tap closing] [shower curtain opening] [exhales] This is Alex McAllister to Mission Control. It is 0900 hours on Mars, and the temperature's a balmy negative 40 degrees. Wind speed, mild 5 knots, and the radiation reading is on track for an annual 200 mSv. Final numbers should be coming in through shortly, but all in all, it is a good day to be on Mars. Over and out. [suspenseful music] [breathing heavily] [projector clicks] [Alex] This is Mars. This will be the first colony on Mars. When we were young, my brother and I would stare at the stars and dream of the day we became astronauts. And now that day is here. I'm going to Mars to write mankind's next chapter. I will travel there in this. And then this will be my home. This is where I'll work, explore, marry, pioneer, and die. Mars is where I'll die. [exhales] [intriguing music] [Alex panting] [heavy breathing] [panting] [Alex panting] [instrumental music continues] [panting] [sizzling] [phone keys clacking] Honey, it's not gonna hurt you if you look away for two minutes. It won't. People will. -Oh, come on. I don't get to see you that often. -[Lizzie] Mom, -I've been busy. -[Jeff] Oh, you're here already. -Hi, Lizzie. -Hi, Dad. Ugh. Wash your hands first, Dad. Get any sleep? Walls are low. I'm gonna have to start trucking in water soon. Or it's time to sell. What? You said yourself. A drought is coming. -[Liz] You need to get out of here. -Nope. I need someone to take over. -Hey, can you flip that one? -Mm-hmm. Clouds cleared. Hey. Were you outside? Hey, thanks for coming. Uh, yeah, anything I can do to fulfill your unreasonable demands. It was a request. -Mom made it a demand. -I did not. Well, I'm grateful you made the impossible journey from the city. -Alexander. -That's fine, Mom. I didn't hear him. -You need me to text it to you? -Would that mean I can leave? -Elizabeth. -Uh, Mom, stop coddling him. -[Jane] I don't coddle him. -Can I start? Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry. Elizabeth. -Okay. -Shh, shh. Come on, settle. Okay, here we go. [clears throat] So, I asked you all here for a reason. -Mm-hmm. -You need a lift? -Oh, Mom. -Sorry. I will not be returning to engineering. Oh, God, just don't tell me it's a food truck. I got through to the next round. -[gasps] Oh. -Next round of what? The Mission Mars Space Program. Um, what the hell is that? I'm going to Mars. Mars? The planet? Yep, and it's a one-way journey, so I wanted to tell you all as soon as I knew for sure. I'm sorry. Are we joking? No, I'm, I'm going to Mars. -Like with NASA? -[chuckles] No. NASA's still, like, 20 years out. We're gonna be going in ten. I'm gonna start training soon, um, in isolation. So, I wanted to make sure that we all spend some time together before that happens. -You really believe this? -[Lisa] Knock, knock. -The film crew. -The what? They wanna interview me for the news. They, they actually wanna talk to you guys too. -What-- other people know about this? -[Alex] Hi. -Uh, come in. Uh, I'm Alex. -Mm. Lisa Kessler, NBC Local News 5. Where can we set up? -Uh, just over there in the backyard. -Um, -hi. Lisa Kessler. -[Jane] Hello. -Hi. -This is so cute. Okay, great. This is really charming. [whispers] It's them? Oh. [chuckles] [Lisa] Um, uh... Oh, I think I could get an Instagram shot here. You let this happen. Dad? He's an adult, Liz. He's lost it. -[sighs] -[Jane] Liz, after the accident, he spent months just lying in his room, and now he gets up early. [chuckles] He goes outside. -So does it really matter why. -Of course it matters. Well, how do you know this isn't real? This is a private company. They have means. Means to get to Mars? Do you have any idea what that would cost? -What kind of technology they would need? -Well, no, but he does. And he's excited, and he's happy. -Dad. -I'm gonna get back to work. -You need to let Alex do this. -Why? Because whatever gets him out of bed in the morning, we will support. We will all support him. Mom, what will people think of us? Well, your father asked him not to name the farm. Mom, I think it's a little bit late for that. Well, then why don't you help him? Hey, they want a photo of me as a kid. I was supposed to be on vacation. -You think one of these will work? -No, not that. Look, you will refer any interview requests to me. You will not say, you will not think a word without my approval, okay? -I don't need a PR person. -Alex, let her. -All right, Alex. -Hi, Liz. Bailey & Co PR. -Let's go over the questions. -Oh, okay. Great. [calm instrumental music] [Alex panting] -[man 1] Okay, three, five. -[man 2] Get two. -[man 3] Morning, Alex. -Hey, guys. Nice day. Freeze! Put your weapons down and your hands up. She said weapons down and hands up! [indistinct chatter] -I'm a civilian. -State your name. Alexander McAllister. -Your purpose? -Supply pick up. -Denied. -[gun pops] -Stop, Blake. -What the... [Blake] Shh, shh, guys, be quiet. Are these marshmallows? You're throwing marshmallows? No, no, I'm... -[man] All right, let's see what you got now. -Ah. There are mini marshmallows, technically. -Oh, my God. Okay, so that makes it totally normal then. -No. It, um-- That's not what I'm saying. Just that... -Um... -[men chuckle] [sighs] Mini. -Oh, swinging a miss. -[men chuckle] Slow news day, guys? [gentle instrumental music] You still have one... ...in your... Missed one. Ah. Ah. -[clears throat] -Thank you. You, you know there's kids up there, right? -I'm... -Really? 'Cause all I see are highly-trained military operatives. [chuckles] Smooth. Thanks, Blake. That's Commander Leehe to you, son. [sighs] Okay. -What am I supposed to say? I don't... -[men chuckling] What family is dahlia pinnata from? -Asteraceae. -Hm. Yeah. And what weeds are in that same family? Alex? I'm not doing this, Dad. [melancholic instrumental music] [video call ringing] -[sighs] -Hey, What's up, Cosmonaut? -Hey, man, did you get in? -You know it. -We're on our way, bro. -Oh, I wish it were tomorrow. Ugh! We'd be the first in line. Oh, hey, did you see the press conference? They say we'll even be able to watch the Super Bowl up there. I don't even watch the Super Bowl now. [scoffs] Well, you will when we're on Mars, brother. Trust me. -Packs Nation. -[chuckles] Hey, any news on training sites yet? Nah. I'm still betting on Antarctica though. It's the closest to the real thing. [exhales] God, I can't wait. -All right. Over. -See you, man. [calm music] [exhales] There you go. There's three more. [sighs] Dimitri? Can you help me with this? Finally, my time to shine. Okay, so I need you to hold this on here. -Yep. -I'm gonna fix these. What does he do? Um, ideally, it will germinate seeds using Martian soil. But Martian soil is useless now. That's what I'm trying to find out. The winters in Russia are the same. It is impossible to grow plants. But somehow life finds a way. That is from Jurassic Park. It's an old Russian pro-- No. Wait, it is from Jurassic Park. Mm-hmm. Yeah. [flips switch] [device whirring] -[device hisses] -[coughs] Oh, oh. Oh, boy. Does not work at all, and it's burning my face. Good practice for space, no? [coughs] This is what it would be like when you disintegrate because you accidentally open a window. [coughs] -Still need you, Dimitri. -[coughs] -I-- -All right. -[Steve on TV] Now to Space News. -Oh. -[Steve] Boy, you don't hear that enough. -[Lisa chuckles] Well, privately funded company Mission Mars has announced its final candidates in a race to colonize the planet. That's right, Steve. The incredibly ambitious, perhaps impossible goal of the program is to get humans on Mars by 2028... ...decades ahead of NASA, SpaceX, and Virgin Galactic. Mission Mars believes they can by making it a one-way journey, thereby cutting in half the supplies needed for a round trip. -Hmm, you're saying there's no return? -Yes. [Lisa] Colonists will bid farewell to their friends, family and lives here to participate. -You'd hope you'd like your coworkers. -[laughs] [Lisa] Oh, fingers crossed. Who would volunteer to move to a place so uninhabitable, its atmosphere and temperatures would kill you in an instant? Alex McAllister, who I spoke to earlier. Alex, do you really plan to leave Earth forever? [Alex on TV] Without a second thought. Lisa, I'm very excited. [Lisa] But can you even grasp what you're giving up? You're relinquishing your whole life to this program. Well, I think some people may see it as giving up a life, whereas I see it as choosing a new one. -[Lisa] Hm. -Great. He seems like he's in a cult. No, he-- If you have kids up there, are they Martians? You know, I su-- I suppose they would be. -[Lisa laughs] -[Alex laughs, whistles] -[Lisa] Whoo. It takes all kinds. -[Alex] It does. [indistinct chatter] Saw you on the news last night. -Yeah, it's pretty good, right? -[Blake] Attack! -[gun popping] -[groans] -[sighs] -Keep moving, citizen. [men laughing] [calm instrumental music] -[phone ringing] -[mutters indistinctly] ...coms team to mission control. -Mr. McAllister? [gasps] -Oh. So, this is how you greet people? Only when I'm trying to make a good impression. Okay, well, I'm Daisy, and I'm going to be handling your insurance. Oh, okay. Where's Mike? He asked me to sit down with you. I hope that's okay. Ye-- Yeah, yeah. A-- Absolutely. -Screw Mike. [chuckles] -He's my uncle. -He never mentioned you. -Must be deeply ashamed of me. [phone ringing in the background] What can I do for you, Mr. McAllister? -Oh, Alex. -Alex. Uh, I need a life insurance policy. Okay. What's the purpose? -I'm going to Mars. -[chuckles] Okay. So, we'll just need our interplanetary template then. Great. [chuckles] -Mars? -Yes. -How? -The Mission Mars Space Program. Okay. Wow. All right. Mars. Mars. I ironically don't have a template for that, but we could just start with our standard form. Um, okay. Why are you going? You know, no one ever asks me that. I am. Uh, because it's Mars. -And? -Oh, and, and we know next to nothing about the universe, and we're not gonna figure it out from here. We have to explore. You know, if we get to Mars, maybe we'll find some answers. [gentle music] [inhales] I know it sounds crazy... ...but walking on the moon also seemed impossible until it happened. Everything that we know, everything that makes us great was once an insane idea. It doesn't sound insane when you say it like that. And plus, we're not gonna be able to live here much longer. Gonna have to start looking at other options. I mean, we've completely destroyed this planet. And back to grim reality. Did you just move here? It's a small town. Yeah, I did. -Why? -[clicks tongue] Sometimes you wake up with this burning desire to be an insurance salesman, and you'll do anything to make that dream a reality. I wanted to be a swimmer. What happened? [smacks lips] A lot of other people did too. Hmm. I'm a terrible swimmer. Then at least I'll beat you. [chuckles] [door creaks] I, uh, I may have some follow-up questions if that's okay. Um, y-- yeah. Got any plans tonight? I'm studying the composition of Martian dirt. Me too. -I'm just kidding. I'm just watching TV. [chuckles] -[mutters] Well, h-- have a swell night. -Hey, how did it go? -[Blake] Here he comes. -[gun popping] -[Alex] Ah! [Daisy] Is he for real? He's always been a little odd. Listen, we can't insure him if this is nonsense, but his family's been a part of the community for generations, and, frankly, they've had a rough time recently. We owe it to them to look into it. I know it's not part of your job description, but do you think-- -No, I'll do it. -Yeah? -Yeah. -All right. Good night. Night. [gentle instrumental music] [sighs] [low tractor whirring] [bright instrumental music] [bird tweeting] [Dimitri] She's saying when you say her name, she will run through the flames to you. Peace will prevail. There will be peace because you said her name? And fire. [speaks in Russian] Peace and fire. [indistinct conversation] [whispers] It's the girl. -Wow, this is beautiful. -[chuckles] -Hi. -Hi. -[chuckles] -Hello. [Alex] Hi. -Oh, I think I hear your father... -Yes. Mother, I-- -So you live in a flower farm? -Yeah, flowers everywhere. -Any daisies? -No, daisies are weeds. Thank you. Well, uh, sorry to just show up. I just had a couple more questions, and you didn't leave a phone number. I don't have a phone. Part of preparing for isolation. [chuckles] Right, of course. Isolation. Well, we can underwrite a policy, but since this is such a unique situation, I just need a couple more details so I can come up with a plan. Okay. I'm actually heading somewhere right now. -[Alex] I'm late for something. -Oh, okay. It's just a, a local first aid course at the school. -Dimitri usually helps me out with it. -Can't tonight, so busy. [chuckles] All of the plans. Um, but you, you could come if you want. I mean, it would answer some of your questions probably. You're learning first aid for space. Yes, just locally at the moment, but they'll put us through a full training course later down the line. Right. [gentle instrumental music] But I, I have to go right now. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. -Great, great. -Yeah. Oh. -Yeah, yeah, sorry. I gotta take these to the front. -Yeah, take your time. -[exhales] All right, CPR Warriors. Picture this. Your cousin has jumped into the pool, can't swim, and is now drowning. You must resuscitate her. Begin. And for you, Alex, Daisy here has taken her helmet off for too long. Oh, then she'd be dead instantly. Why? Because there's very little oxygen. Well, let's say there is oxygen. There isn't. She'd be dead. [sighs] Then, say, she fell into a pool, too, but the pool is on Mars. Resuscitate her. All right, everyone, remember, CPR. -Am I supposed to be drowning? Okay. -[Alex] Um, yeah. [clears throat] I'm so sorry. I did not realize -we were doing CPR tonight. -[Renee] Good job, Scott. -You have to watch the angle of the neck. -Sure, you didn't. -[exhales] Hm. -[Renee] Alex. She's dying. Save her now. Hm, and, uh... -This... -[Renee] That's great. Everyone pushing. [Alex] Uh... [Renee] All right, over the lungs. -[man] Thanks. -[exhales] [Alex] Then I do the thing with the mouth. That's great. Uh, that makes sense. Um, [clears throat] okay. And then this part. Okay. [coughs] -Oh. -[Daisy] Oh, you're doing it wrong. How about I just show you? -Yeah, yeah. -[Alex] Okay. No, I-- -I was a swimmer, remember? -Right, yup. [sighs] [exhales] -Okay. -[Renee] You're all doing great. Just another two minutes to go. -[exhales] -Check the pulse. -Okay. -[Renee] Bravo, Daisy. [Renee] After surviving a near drowning, -she has pulled Alex from the water... -[laughs] [Renee] ...and now saved his life. [gasps] Is this an art room? Sorry. I thought we'd be tying bandages or something. Yeah, you said that already twice. Oh. There are some real Picassos in here. This is my favorite subject. Nice. Really? I thought you would be more quantitative. Math and science? Yeah, don't get me wrong. I was great at those. [Alex mumbles] All right. Do you still swim? [clicks tongue] Never. But it was your life. Yep, and now it's not. [instrumental music] [inhales] Well, it always helps to remember that we're just living on a rock, hurtling through space, and our meaningless existence can end at any moment. Doesn't it keep me warm at night? [chuckles] Sorry. I'm gonna give a talk to the kids here next week. About space? Can I come? Why? Maybe I wanna learn more about my meaningless existence. Okay. Sure, yeah, then you should come. She's just doing my insurance. A woman named Martha does my insurance. -Have you heard me talk about her? -No. Yeah, that's 'cause Martha is a hoarder who dresses like she died on the Titanic. -Hm. -You gotta take these opportunities when they fall in your lap, bro. It's not like that. Make it like that. [chuckles] [bright instrumental music] No, no, no, no. Do not let Colin do it. He'll try and poach the entire... Okay, look, I'll type something up tonight, and you're gonna say that you did it because I'm, I'm not losing that account. Okay. [line disconnects] -[clears throat] -What's Peter doing here? I asked him to appraise the farm. -Get him off my property. -When he's done. I told you I'm not selling. Yeah, I know, and I think you should reconsider. Well, it's not your farm, Elizabeth. You don't get to make the call. Dad, you can't keep going like this. You're working yourself to the bone. I'm fine. I have Dimitri. Really? He's not enough. [sighs] Alex helps. Only when he's not off pretending to board spaceships. Mom can't even finish a bouquet. How are profits without, uh, flower design? This isn't sustainable, Dad. You should be retired. I'll retire when I hand the farm over. Over to whom? Look, I know you had a plan before, but you don't have a successor anymore. You need a new plan. -Maybe seeing some figures will help. -It's not about the money, Liz. Well, you're not exactly handing over the Byzantine Empire, okay? They're just flowers. They don't do anything. They don't really matter. I'm afraid we're gonna have to agree to disagree there. How can you even stand to be here? He's everywhere. I'm not selling. It will go to a developer. And if we continue down that path, there will be no farms left. We'll have to import even more from halfway around the globe. No, Liz, we, we gotta hold on to our farms. This is our spot. It's our little corner of the world... ...and I'm not giving it up. Send Peter home. Don't you dare show me the value. [sighs] [exhales] For 210 days, I'm gonna travel there in this, and then, this will be my home. This is where I'll work, explore, marry, pioneer... ...and die. Mars is where I'll die. And this is for children? Yeah. And you must end on dying. That is how it ends. But you really want to bring that up to first graders? -Second graders. -Maybe you should talk more of space adventures. Like discovering aliens, or, or, or racing rovers. Oh, oh. Oh. Playing basketball. That's Space Jam. Ah, yes. I do not think they would realize this though. But that's not real, Dimitri. [sighs] Well, this is not yet real either. But it will be. That's the difference. Let me see it again. [claps] [sighs] So, they're sending you to Mars, but they only care about my medical opinion. I don't usually work for NASA. Well, you were approved. How? I deal in flu shots and diaper rash. You need the kind of doctor that doesn't have these on their desk. Well, I, I mean, how do you know that NASA doesn't have lollipops? Some wild guess. Okay. Just the standard physical. Great. It will be easy, you know. -You still disease free? -Mm-hmm. Open. Close. [thermometer beeps] -Any alcohol or drug habits? -Uh-uh. Hmm. You know, they didn't even ask for a TB test. -They have one of those just to move countries. -[thermometer beeps] I'm sure they will at, at some point down the line though. Hmm. -Oh, your joints are fit for space travel. -Great. -Ten years might be a whole other story. -Right. Oh, I'm, I'm-- I'll be all right. I'm keeping fit. -How's your mental health? -It's fine. No, you don't get to decide that. Just how are you feeling? Fantastic. You willing to see a psychologist to confirm that? Nah. So you're asking me to sign off on your psych evaluation as well? -Yep. -Hmm. -[children giggling] -It's nice of you to support him. I wanna make sure he doesn't say anything unhinged. -This is so irresponsible. -They're children. -[bell rings] He's not telling them unicorns exist, Lizzie. Hmm. Oh, just in time. There he is. [chuckles] I'm so proud of you. This is such a good thing that you're doing. This is so good. Ah, you're on vacation. Uh, well, sometimes inferior colleagues use that as an opportunity to attempt coups on your accounts. Okay, so when I'm with my clients, I tell them to stick to the story. -Hm. -And your story is space. Not you in space, because that's a hypothetical, but space. But I'm going to space. Do you think we could just keep it to what's real right now though? Are we paying you for this? Could you, please, just teach them facts? And when you have a shuttle and a launch date, you can come back and tell them about the mission. Yeah, sure. -[Liz] What are you looking at? -Well, someone might come -Yeah, it is how hallways work. -No, someone I invited. Okay. Focus. [Alex exhales] All right. I, I heard you guys were learning about the solar system. [kid 1 whispers] This is making me sleepy. [yawns] [kid 2 whispers] Can I get out of this class? Um, you guys got a favorite planet? -[kid 3] Stupid planets. -[kid 4] This is so boring. [mellow music] How about this? Everybody up. [sighs] All right. Wow. We're just gonna have you sit over there. Okay. Okay. Blake, if you could go to the center of the room. You are going to be the sun. The center of our solar system. Everybody orbits around you. Hi. Could you stand near Blake? Now, you are going to be Mercury. It only takes you 88 days to orbit Blake, so you're gonna be moving kinda quickly like this. -[kid 5] Only 88 days? -Perfect. -Who wants to be Venus? -Me, me, me. You. Great. Up. Okay, so you are second closest to the sun and the brightest planet, okay? You're gonna orbit like that. [all chuckling] -Now, who would like to be Earth? -I do. Every time you go all the way around Blake, it has been an entire year. Louie, you're gonna be the moon, okay? You're going to orbit Earth. Now, go. Fantastic. [children chuckling] Mars, Mars, Mars. Mars. Okay. Mars is where we'll live in the future. -Mm-hmm. -Okay, let's go. -You guys getting dizzy yet? -[all] No! If everyone else could just come and surround our planets. You're gonna be the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Now, there are billions and billions of you. -So imagine... -Elizabeth, take the star. And that's the solar system. [indistinct chatter] [mouths] Hi. [mouths] Hi. Okay, well, there's 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and there's maybe 10 trillion galaxies in the universe. If you multiply that by 100 billion, you get an extremely rough, probably low estimate for the amount of stars that exist. Which is? It's a 1 with 24 zeros after it. We make the mistake of thinking that the universe is for us, but it's not. It's-- -It's-- -Okay. New rule. Every time you mention how meaningless our existence is, I'm gonna need another drink, and you have to join me. -Right. -Come on. Right. Uh... [upbeat music playing over speakers] [chuckles] [Alex] It-- uh, oh, gosh, it's right-- No, I have it. -I had it. Um... -Okay. [blowing air] -Dais. -No. -Dee-Dee. -Don't you dare. -[laughs] -What? Look, I know that Daisy is a tricky one. I mean, my coaches used to call me Zee. -Mm-hmm. -As in Lazy Daisy. Especially when I couldn't make my time. It hurt a little. [chuckles] You must miss it. -Swimming? -[Alex] Yeah. Yeah, it was my purpose, and, um, now, I just don't know where I belong. I don't know what to do with the hours in the day. I don't know what to do on this planet. I don't know what to do with my hands. [chuckles] -I don't know. -Nobody's good at just one thing. -Yeah. -You're really good at first aid. But you don't love it. Oh, my gosh, it's the Martian. -What? -Your nickname. Is it too on the nose? It feels obvious, but it's so good. [laughs] Okay. Well, I-- it beats the current one. Which is? Alexander the Great. Really? Yeah, we were named after historical figures. Elizabeth, Thomas, Alexander. So the conqueror, the queen, and the inventor. [Alex] Yep. That's, like, not too much to live up to. Oh, no, not at all. He had just conquered half the known world by the time he was 32. So, you've got time. I mean, he didn't go to Mars. It was not like they could fathom that there were even other planets. -You can't-- -All right. Bartender! -Bar-- -[lightning crashes] -Oh, wow. -That's a storm. -Um, you don't have to walk me home. -Wow. No, I, I'm not afraid of the rain. -[woman 1] I'll see you later. -[woman 2] Nah, just like that is fine. At least you won't have to worry about rain on Mars. Whoa. No, just solar flares that cause storms that lasts for hundreds of years. Okay. When I said I didn't need you to walk me home, I meant literally. It's so close. This is a building site. It is rustic, and Mike is fixing it up. Well, have a slow night. That is funny. [chuckles] Um, I... [thunder crashing] [romantic instrumental music] [bag crashes] -Bedroom. -What? -Bedroom. -Oh. [chuckles] -Oh, yeah. -Wait. Come here. Through the door, you barbarian. [laughs] Um, I just-- um... Is this okay? -Yeah. -Okay. [calm instrumental music] [heavy breathing] [exhales] [sighs] [Jeff] That was the first rain we've had in a month. [Liz] Great. Uh, have you looked into this Mars company? If you're gonna follow me around, at least help. Well, if you're gonna refuse to sell, at least prepare for the drought. How am I supposed to do that? [grunts] For one, switch to drought-resistant varieties. Get a more efficient irrigation system. And next year, only irrigate half the land. Half the land, half the profits. Yeah, well, you're losing half the crops regardless, if you don't have enough water, which you won't. [grunts] Oh. It's a bad time to invest in drip irrigation then. [Liz] Actually, it's the perfect time while we still have reserves. So you think this Mars thing might be a scam? What do you think? I should show you something. Come on. -How long does he spend on this? -Hours. You know what this is, right? It's a very sophisticated version of the machine that they built for the science fair that year we had a really bad dry season. Oh, man. Dad, what are we gonna do? He's given up on his career. He's building machines for another planet. He's spending all of his money on merchandise. He's been to see Dr. Olsen. What? For what? His space physical. Okay. Well, then she knows that he's insane. We have to go see her. Maybe she can help. -Ah. -Look, I know it seems harmless now. But what if it progresses? What if we could have helped and we didn't? [sighs] You can't tell your mother. Okay. I'll get the car. Doctor-patient confidentiality means what it sounds like it means. -This is different. It's Alex. -A patient. You've told me about him before. Yes, when he was a child. -Sue, I know it's breaking protocol. -The law. Well, we're concerned. Doesn't mean I'm gonna break the law. Well, I am not leaving. What if I break out one of these? Are your immunizations up to date? Oh. Sometimes at night, I still hear screams from your measles shot. Okay. Give us the information, and you can give me the tetanus booster. Your brother is not crazy. He probably has a slight delusion, but... You yourself were once convinced you were a wizard. I was ten. -This is dangerous. -No, it is not. So far he's just, he's just living out a fantasy. What matters is, it has given him a purpose. Wouldn't a job do the same thing? Do you know how many Mensa members are unemployed? More than you think. What you have is an exceptionally intelligent son, Jeff. Those types often have the hardest time coping. Maybe this is just something he has to do. Okay, well, what about the fact that it's space? He and Tom were obsessed. I'm sure it plays a part, but what would you have me say to him? Right, would he even listen? We all have our distractions. You have looked at that phone -ten times since you walked in. -[notification chimes] [sighs, clears throat] Did you ever see the therapist that I recommended? -[scoffs] I don't have time. -[notification chimes] -[phone keys clacking] -Mm. Lead a horse to water. Okay. Sit still. [sighs] [Renee] All right, CPR warriors. -[Daisy] Hi. -Oh, um... -[Renee] We're about to begin. -[Alex] ...hi. -I, I just... -[Renee] Wonderful. I should apologize, uh, I-- About sneaking out. Oh, the woman that you hung out with a few times doesn't want to talk about it, but the insurance agent who works for you does. Okay. -Things happened. -[Alex] I remember. -It didn't mean anything. -No, we, we were drunk. [chuckles] Yeah. [Renee] Take your places, lifesavers. -[clears throat] -[Renee] Let's go, people. -Heimlich maneuver. -Sorry. So, what are we doing? -The Heimlich maneuver. -No, I mean, you and me. I figured we could be friends. Really? Okay. I didn't think you'd want to. Why? Because you're odd? Because I'm leaving the planet. Oh, I don't mind that. Okay. Then sure, yeah. [Renee] Patients, begin choking. -[whispers] Okay, that was... -[choking] -Lifesavers, start your saving. -Go on. -[chokes] -What, um-- You're not gonna show me how to do it? -You're on your own, kid. -[sighs] [grunts] Don't kill me. [panting] [bright instrumental music] -[timer beeps] -[Daisy] Come on. [both panting] Yesterday you were 28 seconds faster. As you know, I completely regret this. [laughs] [grunts] [sighs] -[laughs] -We didn't have fair competitiveness. What do you think this is? -Oh, my God. Look. -[Blake] Coming in for landing. -Whoa. -[panting] Wow. Hey, there he is. [whistling] -[Liz] I didn't know you could do that. -[gasps, exhales] -Well, it was nice. -Thank you. [exhales] You're gonna help me install this in the dahlia fields, or you're gonna be my nemesis forever. -Wh... -It's a drip irrigation system. That your father doesn't know you're installing. Correct. Okay. Yes, I'm more scared of you. Good choice. [gentle instrumental music] [Alex] They're not some magical forest thing. Like, they're not fairies. [chuckles] But today is the day when most of them are out. Come on, we're almost there. How's living with your family? We used to get along better. So did mine. What happened? My parents were really, really good coaches who suddenly didn't have anyone to coach. Just me. -[sighs] -What about yours? Um... [sighs] There was an accident... ...not long ago. That... ...that did it. My brother saved my life. Sounds like a pretty great big brother. Yeah. Yeah. He was. [clears throat] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm... fine. It's just hot. [exhales] So where, where is this bug family reunion then? [chuckles] They're still setting up. -DJ was late. You know how it is. -[both laugh] -Ah. -[chuckles] Did you kill it? -No. -Then where is it? I don't know. Oh, wait. He's fine. That's not the same one. [both laughing] Wow. Wow. [chuckles] You realize you're getting joy from a bug's ass lighting up. Oh, come on. So are you. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Watch them pretty, pretty butts. [chuckles] Now, how could you think about giving all this up? [calm instrumental music] [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] We're calling it the Mars Grover. No, we're not doing that. -Uh-huh. -Well, that sounds good. Anyway, this is how the world will work in the future as it gets hotter and drier. Underground, self-sustaining farms, They already have one working in an old tube station in London. I just have to figure out how to make it work. -On Mars. -[Alex] Exactly. So the International Space Station has some seeds growing. Uh, they even have some sprouting on the moon. So, I just need to account for the lack of atmosphere, gravity, radiation. This could go to NASA. I mean it, Alex. This, this could be your thing. They're just -seeds. -It's the survival part. I mean, you could send this to the Rhode Island Space Consortium, and you could get funding and a team and everything. Uh, I don't think it'd be ready for that. Um, anyways, they could probably use this inside. [indistinct chatter] [Jane] Oh, this looks amazing. -Dimitri, could you take the potatoes, please? -Mm-hmm. Yes. In Russia, we call them kartofel. Beautiful language. Yes. Forget about the glory of the word potato. Oh, well, could you take the kartofel then? -And, Liz? -[Liz] Mom. -Elizabeth. Lizzie! -[Liz] Mom. -I'm doing something. -Take the plates, please. -Can you help me? -Yes. -Thank you. -And come on, please. -Help me with the tarelki. -Okay, comrade. -Well, that's inevitable. -What? -Those two. -[scoffs] Better chance of Putin opening a wildlife sanctuary. I don't know. He's pretty charming. He said potatoes in a different language. It was charming. Patata. -What? [chuckles] -It's Spanish for potato. -[laughs] -Oh, look, they didn't even take the potatoes. -Daisy, could you just grab those, please? -Yeah. -Okay, I'll take the patata. -[chuckles] [gentle instrumental music] [Jeff] Okay, what can I do? Uh, well, you could be here half an hour ago, or you could take the green beans. [door creaks] [door closes] [indistinct chatter] -[Jane laughs] -[Jeff] Where'd you get that shirt, Dimitri? [Dimitri] I think, um, from the Salvation Army. -[Jeff] Mm-hmm. -[Dimitri] Very cheap. -[Jeff] Well, you wore it well. -[Dimitri] They're good quality. -[Alex]... Mars -[Daisy] Yeah. [indistinct chatter] -[Alex]Well, there are many done. Once in a while... -Um, -so, Daisy, you seem normal. -[Dimitri laughs] [Daisy] Relatively. -[Liz] How do you tolerate Alex? -[Jane] Uh, Liz? -He's not the worst. -[Alex] Thank you. You're, uh, you're not an investigative reporter, are you? Are you? I read a profile on one of the British applicants who revealed everything to a reporter feigning friendship. -[Alex sighs] -[Liz] Daisy, you get it. Yeah. I mean, it's all right. -I'm not a reporter. -[sighs] That's great. [Liz] Although crossed arms are -a sign of defense. -I mean, really, Elizabeth, who wouldn't be defensive under this interrogation? I am just looking out for my brother. -No, you're looking out for yourself. -[Jane] Okay, -Alexander, Elizabeth. -[Liz] Oh, my God, come on. [Jane] Hey, stop. -[Liz] Okay. -[Jeff] Mm. -I'm sorry. -I heard about their names, Mrs. McAllister. -They really suit them. -Oh, God. No, we don't. Well, I mean, you run a PR firm. Alex is about to conquer space. It fits. [Jane] I certainly hope so. I spent my pregnancies buried in books. Well, what she means to say is you were looking like a Genghis there for a minute. [all laugh] [Daisy] And then what about Tom? Was he like a big inventor? Mm. [sighs] Sorry. I shouldn't have. Daisy, what did you think about the green beans tonight? -They were very good. -[Jane] Weren't they? Dimitri brought that recipe over from Russia. Mom, we put paprika on them. It's hardly revolutionary. [Dimitri] Well, maybe it is. [indistinct conversation] [gentle instrumental music] We can finish another row today. Get ahead on orders. Good to see you enjoying the farm. Yeah, it's nice. [Jeff] You know, I can't run this place much longer. I wanna leave it in good hands though. I, I was thinking I'd sign it over to you. It won't be easy, you know. Harder with this weather, but... ...worth it, I think, to... ...you know, work the earth and be part of it all. I'm going to Mars. Realistically though. I am being realistic. Well, you know, I just thought I would give you a purpose. I have a purpose. [sighs] I'm not Tom, Dad. So you won't even consider it? Well, no, it just doesn't make any sense. It would be a waste of both of our times when I'm leaving so soon. -You're not actually going, Alex. -I am going. -But I'm giving this to you. -I don't want it. I'm gonna take a break. [exhales] [water running] [Mark] Alex McAllister. Mark Johnston with The Wickford Times. I have a few questions about Mission Mars. Elizabeth McAllister handles all PR requests. Just wanna get your take on new reports the mission's a scam. It is not a scam, okay? -It's real. -Look, Alex, I just wanna hear your side of the story, all right? Can we set the record straight? [panting] He ever tell you how he was selected? -Mm-mm. -Skype interviews. Does that sound legit to you? Look, I don't want you spending too much time on this policy. All right, there's lots of other policies out there way more normal than this particular one. Why do I have a feeling we're not talking about policies? Look, he's always been a nice boy. He's just never been normal. I don't know what you got going with him, but I don't think it's the best idea. Noted. [men laughing] -I thought she had... -Good morning, gentlemen. -Hey. -How you doing? Your boy made the paper, Jeff. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -It's nice to see him smiling. -He's our favorite Martian. [laughing] Keep it. [Bert] He didn't seem so happy. [sighs] Sorry, Jeff. I tried to throw them out, but Bert found them in the dumpster. Not your fault. [gentle instrumental music] [grunts] [indistinct chatter] You're making a goddamn fool out of yourself. -Out of all of us. -What-- Alex, you spoke to reporters? You promised you'd refer them to me. I-- He said it was a scam. I had to say-- You couldn't even change his mind. -It's on the Internet. -He na--, he named the farm. He named our clients, our suppliers. Now, everyone can see this nonsense. -Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. -[Liz] Yes, it does. We're all a part of this now. Well, I mean, they'll see the truth -when I head off to training. -Enough! I said enough. [exhales] This has gone on for far too long, and I-- I won't tolerate it anymore. Your-- your father is just concerned, sweetie, -'cause you're doing something so different. -[Liz] Mom, Dad is right. This needs to stop. -It's his life. -[Jeff] But it's not real. I offered him a real life, and, and he, he, he, he chose this farce. -Because he's giving up! -So you're a therapist now. Why are you even here? Why, why--[scoffs] -Why do you even care? -You're committing suicide, you asshole. And I don't care if you've got a mask in this space explorer bullshit. I know what you're doing. You don't wanna keep going without Tom. -Don't bring him into this. -He is this! This is bullshit! [sobs] Oh, sweetie, I, I didn't realize. Oh, I never should have en-- encouraged. Oh. -No, you-- -I just wanted you to be safe. I never thought you'd actually leave. -Mom-- -I just can't stand not knowing where you both are. I, I just, I can't stand it. [sobbing] [exhales] [sobbing] [crying] There will be no mention of Mars or missions or training under this roof again. -[sighs] -[Jeff] We're done. [gloomy music] [Alex sighs] [door creaks] [door shuts] [somber instrumental music] [knocks] [sighs] [breathing heavily] You wanna go somewhere? -Like right now? -Yeah. There's this place that I wanna take you. But you're not-- We're gonna have to use your car. You're gonna have to drive as well. What an offer. You can't drive? I don't drive. Okay. [gentle instrumental music] [exhales] Where are we going? You'll see. [both chuckling] [Daisy] Whoa! I know you miss swimming, so... Don't get me wrong. I also hate swimming. I know. -You've ruined my life. -Temporarily. [waves crashing] What, what are you doing? Going in! -It's cold! -Come on! What do you think Mars is like? Well, okay, that's different, all right? We'll have protection. All I hear is fear! Whoo! Come on! Oy, come on, come on, come on! Whoo! Ah. -[laughs] -[exhales] Come on. Whoa. Come on, Alexander the Great. [grunts] I used to love doing this as a kid. Just close your eyes and let the waves take you. [screams] Yeah. [waves crashing] [both screaming] [both laughing] No, it's not good. [gentle music] [waves crashing] [screams] [both laughing] -Whoo! -[grunts] [screaming, laughing] You've really never met Curtis before. No, uh, he lives in another state. [knocks] [Curtis] Out the back, round the side. [rock music playing over speakers] [children chattering] Hey, welcome to mi casa. Sorry, I didn't know you had something going on today. We would have-- Oh, no, no. This is nothing. It's nothing. Hey. It was so great to get your call, my man. So great. Bring it in, come here. Bring it in. [grunts] -Oh, nice. -Yeah, right. Um... -Uh, this is, this is Daisy. -Hi. What insurance agency do you work for? I thinking of switching. -Hi. -Curtis, you, you have kids? Yeah, I do. Uh, one, two, uh, third one around here somewhere. Hi, I'm Tiff. -Hi. -[Tiff] Sorry for the chaos. -Alex. -Uh, you're a colonist. -Yeah. -I thought it was just a phase. [chuckles] -[girl] Mommy! Stop. -I better go get them. This thing about Mars is a no-kids policy. Am I right? [laughs] Come on. Um... -Come on. Let me take you to Mission Control. Where the magic happens. -Come on. -Your wife is lovely. Yeah, yeah. Tiff's great. Sit, sit, sit, sit. Oh. Sit. [exhales] It is good to meet you properly, my man. Likewise. Do you realize that I am one of the only people you're gonna see in person for the rest of your life? -Crazy. -Wild. -Sick of waiting, dude. -Right. -When is training gonna start? -I don't know. -I'm good to go, bro. -Right. -Yeah. -Yeah. And your family's cool with you leaving Earth? Yeah. Tiff's fine with it. Really? Yeah, of course. I mean, it's bad if the other person doesn't want you to follow your dreams. Am I right? I am right. Yeah, but they're gonna miss you terribly. What can you do? Space calls. -[knock on door] -[boy 1] Daddy, he hit me. I think, um... [knock on door] [girl 1] Daddy, what are you doing in there? [Tiff] Honey, help me out here with the kids. [techno music playing] Going to space. I cheated at swimming. -What? -That's why I moved here. I wasn't good enough. I was one second short of placing. One second. And I was under a lot of pressure, and so I took a supplement, and I got found out, and I got banned. And now, it defines me. My family's ashamed of me. I'm ashamed of me. Why are you telling me this now? Because I don't wanna have anything in common with that guy. Look, I, I know Curtis doesn't come off well, but he's, um, he's actually really intelligent. -He published this paper on solar phase-- -He's going to Mars to escape his life, and you know it. So that's what you think I'm doing? I'm asking if you are. -Where are you going? -I need a minute. -Uh, I'm talking to you. -So keep talking to me. Fine. I looked into your mission. -And? -And it's a bunch of ifs and maybes. -It's a risk. -It's giving up. You act like the world is such a bad place-- It's a shit world. Then change it. You like me, and you won't acknowledge it. And the crazy thing is, is that I like you too. But we can't do anything about it because it doesn't fit into your schedule. So, what am I supposed to do? Quit the mission so I can date you? No. I just want you to consider why you're actually doing it. If it's to be an explorer or a scientist, then great. -But if not-- -If not what? [sighs] You only get one life, Alex. And if you waste it waiting, you don't get a second one. It's ironic to be lectured by a cheater hiding in a country town. [somber instrumental music] [sighs] I'm going to Mars, Daisy. And for the record, I still don't see you making any great decisions. At least I'm trying, asshole. [opens car door] [slams car door] [engine starts, car drives off] Hey! Okay. You're going to hit these until you don't want to anymore. This is stupid. -Even so. -[sighs] Okay. You know, my brother used to play this dumb game. [sighs] Okay. -[clank] -Whoa. How could he just disappear like that? I think he went to see Daisy. [clank] Tom. [grunts] How could he leave me in charge of this insane family? Again! [grunts] Again! We can stay here all night. -[clanks] -Whoa. -[clanks] -[grunts] [tap running] [slow instrumental music] [Jeff] He'll come home when he's ready. [car approaching] Thanks, Curtis. [sighs] Ah, I asked you to do one thing. One thing. Just let me know you're all right. Okay? I don't... I don't have to. Okay? It's not my job... ...to make you feel better. [footsteps approaching] Oh, you, you are right. You are absolutely right. That is not your job. That's ridiculous. [chuckles] Oh. Oh, you do whatever you want, sweetie. [chuckles] Just vanish again. Go to another planet. Just send me a postcard. [chuckles] Ah. Oh, but don't forget a jacket. I hear Mars gets chilly at night.

[panting] I never noticed how alike the boys are when they, when they get angry. -See, they get that... -Mm-hmm. It's a, it's a stupid thing to notice, really. [panting] Did Tom...

I can see his feet. I'm coming up. This used to feel a lot higher. Sorry I dragged you into all this. Oh. You know, I, I hit some baseballs recently, and I emerged... ...strangely fine about everything. So I did you a favor. Oh, don't get carried away. Look, I know I, um, haven't been around. It's, um, just... When I look at you, I think of Tom. And then, I imagine you dying as well. Which, trust me, I know I need colossal amounts of therapy to fix. Just imagining it, the pain, so unbearable, it's easier to just stay away and... ...work every hour of the day. I thought there was something wrong with me 'cause I imagined you dying. Really? -We're fucked up. -I think we really are. [both laughing] God, I miss him so much. Me too. Even though he was the, uh, blatant favorite. God, farm wonder and baseball star. With rugged good looks, and none of our debilitating anxiety. None. He always gestured too much when he was telling stories. What was that about? -[laughs] -This one. [laughs] -[sighs] -Hmm. You see Mars from here? Um, no, it's behind the sun for the next few months. -Hm. -You can see Venus though. You're willing to live in such a big universe. I prefer thinking it's only us. -Never been only us. -Mm. Do you think he's up there? [sighs] No. He's in the ground. [sighs] -Remember this? -Oh, what? I thought we lost it. [chuckles] [slow instrumental music] Oh, the queen. And... ...and the conqueror. [crying] [Jeff] You're up early. I couldn't sleep. You know, um, my vacation time ran out. But I can't go back. Now that I'm here, I can't, uh, I can't go back and pretend that I care. These stupid flowers, these, apparently, I care about. What's the common name for Lathyrus Odoratus? -Sweet pea. -And what's the most valuable peony? -Sonoma Halo. -Wrong. Pastelegance. Actually, Sonoma Halo took over last year. It also happens to be a more drought-resistant variety. I know what I'm doing, okay? Okay. [sighs] [gentle instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [Blake] Is the rocket ready? Permission to board the spacecraft. Proceed via the airlock chamber. Okay. [Blake] Oh, Wow. Delivery from Earth. These were my brother's and mine. But I thought you guys would get some more use out of them. Your brother who died? Yeah. Yeah. Um, you remember him? [chuckles] Uh-huh. He was nice.

The grey one? -Uh, yes, in the hall closet. -Great. I'm going to the dry cleaners if anyone wants me to take anything? What's the occasion? Um, I'm getting my suit dry-cleaned. Thank you. I meant why. Oh, I got a job interview. Where? It's called the Rhode Island Space Consortium. They've got some impressive resources. I was surprised they expressed interest in my project. -The Mars Grover? -Still not calling it that, but, um... ...they're run by NASA, so, you know. And the Mission is okay with that? Uh, I was actually just gonna focus on this right now. [chuckles] Well, you go get it, honey. [chuckles] -This is wonderful. -It is. It's a great idea. Much better than mine. It's just an interview, yeah. -Well, it's still great. -Hmm. It was when Daisy suggested it too. Oh. -I don't remember that. -Oh? Remember, she was like, "They'll give you funding." You were like, "No, thanks. I'm fine in my greenhouse." No. -You know, I always liked her. -So did I. -Me too. -[Dimitri] I like anyone who likes the Mars Grover. I get it. You all like Daisy. [sighs] [laughs] [gentle instrumental music] [Dimitri grunts] Alex, Listen, here he is. This is the Russian Frank Sinatra. There's a Russian Frank Sinatra? Or is Frank Sinatra an American Vladimir Kastivazhiyanki? [chuckles] -[Russian song playing] -[singing] There was something in the sky that night. [singing in Russian] Oh, there was something in the air like light. [singing in Russian] There's a magical spark, like breaking car parts. [chuckles] It sounds more romantic in Russian. [sighs] Damn it. Well, it's not that bad. [sighs] No, it, it just sounds like they're singing about fireflies. No, it doesn't. We don't even have them in Russia. -Liz? -What? -You know where Daisy works? -Yeah. Okay. I need you to try and get her here. Um, what changed your mind? [Dimitri] Oh, Elizabeth, I would sing it for you, but then you will fall in love with me even more. Okay, calm down, Romeo. Why can't you go? I, I gotta do something first. Well, what am I supposed to say to her? I don't know. PR something. -That's not how that works. -Liz. I'll go. I'll go. [slow instrumental music] [sighs] You get one minute. Not much of a lunch break these days. I'm sorry. You trusted me, and I used that against you. What I said was indefensible. I, I don't have any excuses. It's-- I'm just really sorry. [sighs] Okay. Why are we standing in dirt? Um, it's a... ...field of daisies. We only had the seeds. And not a whole field free. It's a row of daisies. It was a, it was a lot of work. It's very nice. It could have waited until after work though. You're right, and I was wrong. Never mind, I like this. For me, space is safe as I can control it. Even though it's completely unpredictable and ever-expanding into a degree where it could all implode at once. But that is not the point. That, that-- This is, this-- The point is this. And this is terrifying. I'm terrified. You are terrifying. Glad I brought so much to the table. My brother died. -I know. -But I never told you... We were driving, and there was a deer in the road, and we swerved. I, I swerved. [exhales] He was really great, Daisy. He had my Mom's eyes. And, um... He was funny. And the last thing he did was he put his arm out to protect me. Even though we all know that doesn't do anything. [sighs] But since then, I have been so scared of that happening to anyone else that I love. [exhales] So, that's how I know that this is the real adventure for me. That, that part, that was corny. [chuckles] But you understand what I'm saying? I do. [cart pulls over] What you got there? Uh, daisies. Weeds? Couldn't exactly do roses. Oh, actually, I kind of like daisies. But just try to keep them away from the other plants, okay? [Liz] Dad! Go away. Go. Forever a weed. [sighs] What about Mars though? There's no daisies on Mars. Oh, my God. Wow. Wow. Oh, my God. [laughs] Did, did you rehearse that or something? No, I actually came up with that on the spot. I loved it. Really? Really. [gentle instrumental music] -[clapping] -Yes, yes, yes! Yes! [clapping] -Yay! -Whoo! Whoo! -Whoo! -[Liz] Go, you. -Oh, oh, oh! -Awesome. -Go. -Sorry. -Yes. -[both laugh] [chuckles] [Alex] This is Mars. This will be the first colony on Mars. Two hundred and ten days. people will travel there in this. Then this will be their home. But I will be here. This is my home.
