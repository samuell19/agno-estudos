What I like about this plain is that you can scream. It even has an echo! Christo, we have a problem with the music. No, I bought a bigger stereo. I'll put a speaker here and a speaker there. Yes, but different crops need different music. You only play Greek traditional music. To start putting music on, the tempo needs to improve. In the spring, we haven't planted the tomatoes yet, and the wheat has already been harvested. That field will be empty and we will play music in the next field. That part of the field is for tomatoes. Over there, it's for the wheat. This plantation stands tall and sways in the wind. -She needs... “Needs Wagner! Wagner! How do you know Wagner? I was raised with Wagner! First I listened to Wagner and then traditional Greek music. TOMATOES, SAUCE AND WAGNER Lots of tomatoes. But they're all green! Yeah, they're green. I don't see any mature, -How long to mature? -Ten days. Stop! -Okay here? EILur -Is it too heavy? -You'll tire me out! How should I place? Like this. -Not like that! -Which way? -Turn that way. -Like this? We'll put the other one facing this way so the music disperses. It's autumn and the tomatoes must ripen. So what do they need now? They need something to make them blush. To feel ashamed? We need to find the right radio station. To the third radio station that only plays classical music. And when you're gone, I'll switch to Greek music! Do as you wish. There shouldn't be so few tomatoes at this time of year. There are usually many. Aunt Katina, take it! That's half a kilo. Place three sprigs of parsley. Well done Christo! The stuffed tomatoes might not work out, but at least everything will be finely chopped. Alexander, we're going to need more tomatoes. Tell Costas to hurry up. Need to move well. All our products smell good. It was a good year. -Why didn't it rain? -Yes. So let's check. We put rice, carrots, salt, olive oil, mint, pepper. -Have we estimated the cost yet? -No. “It tastes good. -But? But it needs raisins. And more pepper. Call Christo. It is good. It is good. - But it smells like... -Mint. -And you don't use mint. -No, I don't. Don't use mint, Aleco. Put oregano and pepper on the rice. Oregano is bitter. -Is it bitter because it's in a glass? -And, it gets bitter with time. How are we going to market this? It doesn't even have a name. -Do we need to create a label first? -For sure. It needs to reach the market to have a return. "Return"! What word! We have been forgotten by man and by God. Indeed, God has not forgotten us. But there is not a single store, nothing. -We had two coffee shops. -Now, not even one. I cannot tell you how I met my husband. Stavroula came here to pick cotton. Agathi, don't give away everything! -Christos was her boss. -I worked in the fields. Did you expect him to ask her to marry him? Don't be an idiot, they were already having an affair! Did you have sex before marriage? They had met a few times. Near the river, under the chestnut trees. -There are 10 boxes outside? -Seven, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. -How many more to reach 24? -Do the math. -Let's do it together. -Should I count on my fingers? No, in your mind. How many more from 13 to 20? Ten! Seven! And how many from 20 to 24? -Four. -Seven plus four? Eleven! Aunt Agathi got it right! We need 11 boxes. But say, what brought you here, to the field? -You studied at the university. -And? What does study have to do with work? Do you regret dropping out of what you studied? I haven't abandoned anything. It's all in my mind. In your mind? Studying and working are two different things. But now you're wasting all that knowledge! No, let me explain. -Is reading a book a waste? -No. It's the same with math. Let's continue. - We're at a hundred... -1,240! I knew. I didn't need to say it so quickly. I wasn't good at school, but I know a few things. Good afternoon. Goodbye, good meal. I only have one brain for all seasons. Do birds hear these bells and sing more? Or does the wind hear them and grow stronger? We came here to solve the irresolvable. Our dreams. How to change the world without a revolution. Theories. Do you believe they stole our dreams? It's a shame to base dreams on ecoriomy alone. Do you agree? Yes, if money is not your dream. -And to you? -No. Neither for me. Farmers live with the certainty that they have food. That they won't go hungry, no matter what. So you see how hard it is to change things? For agriculture to change, it needs to connect with the city. If agriculture doesn't connect with consumers, it won't change. The future of agriculture is in the production of raw materials. And for the production of raw materials, farmers are not needed. Need machine operators. It's that simple! For example, a company comes and tells you to produce tomatoes. -A specific tomato! -With the specific Monsanto seed. A specific seed, with a specific weight and color. Just that tomato! And only they can buy. So how do you convince the consumer not to buy the Italian tomato, which costs $2.5 euros, and to buy the organic Greek one instead, for more than $3 euros? How do you convince him? It's a question of education, but also of money. There is a big problem with the cost of producing quality products. You have to start, somehow. Somehow... I was born on these plains. I left and then came back. I often look at the fields. I hold the earth in my hands and it seems to be a part of me. Of course it could be pure fantasy, a myth. But if you can't find the words to describe your experience, you create a poem, or a myth, and move on. Alexander, we need a labeller for the next order. Okay, but this is a trial order. Yes, but it's hard to stick labels on 5,000 bottles by hand. I agree, but do you know the story behind this request? The story begins 500 years ago. There was a European named Christopher. He left with other men and discovered America. And he brought with him the riches he found there. And what were those riches? -Besides the gold, they were... -Seeds. And we are still growing those same seeds. We haven't changed seeds since then. Meanwhile, in America they have been growing modified seeds and hybrids. They lost the old seeds. And in 2014, 500 years later, we're still growing the ancient seeds, and now, we're affixing labels to an order that's going to San Francisco next week! Can you understand what it means? That 500 years later we are sending . the tomatoes back to them when they should have flooded the world with those tomatoes. So I think it's worth pgna to label the glasses by hand. Alexander, we need to make 1,500 more glasses! They will cross two oceans to reach San Francisco! -Interesting? -Very. Come help us sweep. Good morning. -Girls! -Coffee break time? No, just a second. Today I will read you a story. “The Flower Girl”. “Once upon a time, in a village like ours, there lived a girl who everyone thought was a fairy. When she walked, she seemed to float and moved faster than all the other girls. Her thoughts were like a brook and her gaze was different from every other girl's. Everything she looked at blossomed. All year round, winter, spring, summer, autumn. When she aimed at a dry branch, flowers bloomed. In a few months, the villagers who lived in that place stopped feeling pain, sadness or joy. Even Flower Girl's thoughts stopped. The new thoughts couldn't shake off the old ones to replace them. The thoughts remained motionless, one on top of the other. Then, the Flower Girl realized that her “flower look” had made that still land a land that was like ours. It was all her fault and her look. She was devastated. Something had to be done for the happiness and sadness to return.” Not this one either. That's good for tomatoes! Because it contains something red. It is what we must do. And as we harvest them, we're supposed to play a traditional Greek song about immigration and separation. As the tomatoes leave the field, they come to the production laboratory, are processed, placed in glass jars and begin their immigration around the world. Yeah, I think this one is the best! This combined with Greek music. Perfect! Perfect! I think I'll convince you. See, it starts to become a tomato. They're all great. We certainly need to produce, or we're done for. -Our stock is empty. - Our business will be closed. English and Americans will send requests, and nothing. They grow up with music. Remember the last time we changed the music? -Yes. -The tomatoes started to wilt. Already with traditional music Listen to how beautiful it is. I'm listening. Once the radio got out in the rain and stopped playing. And two days later, the tomatoes withered. Christo, tomatoes that listen to classical music are way better than those that listen to Greek music. But look how this area is full of tomatoes. It's where we play traditional music! I'm not kidding, it's already proven. So let's put in bigger speakers. No, I'll just put one in the middle of the field. -In the middle? -Yes. I will put an extension and position it in the middle. Let's vary the music a little bit. Not just traditional Greek music. But the harvest quadrupled with traditional music. But if you think classical music is better, let's try it. -Just to vary. -Yes why not? -They can be tastier. "Perhaps. We must try. If our husbands came home from work and the food wasn't on the table, they would yell at us. Were they that strict? What if the pie wasn't done right? My husband once told me that if the pie wasn't good he would throw it in the middle of the square. Men treated women like soldiers. They could never rest. Has your husband ever asked if you were tired? -I woke up at 5 am. -To milk the cow? Agathi always reminisces about old times. She doesn't remember anything new. Just from the past. Girls! Come here, aunt. There's no way we can find our village on this world map. But here we are. -The last order we sent... -Where did it go? To Hong Kong. So far? Hong Kong is here, in China. So the tomatoes left Piraeus and went through the Suez Canal. I don't think they went around Africa. They crossed the Indian Ocean, passed through the Maldives, probably through here to Singapore. The other route is through the Mediterranean to Gibraltar crossing the Atlantic Ocean to the USA. -Do we send honey to the US? -No, just tomatoes. What a lovely trip they make! Can we go too? We also export to Costa Rica. We also send honey there. We must go there too! Here, in Gibraltar, it gets pretty hectic. This way to the Caribbean and then on to Costa Rica. But this is quite interesting. When Columbus left Spain he went to America and brought tomatoes to Europe and very slowly they overtook us here. -The seed. -And we kept it. And now, we send it back. Where do today's packages go? -England. -England. Where else do we send tomatoes, Alexander? Mostly for Europe. For Germany, France Switzerland, Sweden Denmark, Italy. Are the tomatoes selling well? We produce tomatoes every year. We try. But it is difficult, very difficult. "Why? They do not like? -We are a drop in the ocean. Someone has been here. Life is only one. And after the body degrades, what then? - Matter changes shape. -And becomes the earth? Is that where your mind stops? Earth, then plant, rock, water, wind and water again But isn't it sad to think that when a man dies he turns into a worm? Why is it sad? He was a worm, bigger or smaller, before that! That's the connection. The past may have been just as magnificent. And if we consider non-existence to be like that, it is also like that. -It's wrong. -Probably. You try to define non-existence in existential terms. But non-existence has a hole in the middle where there are no worms, memories, or anything. Selfishly speaking I would like to know what happens after death. But if we did, we would lose the sense of futility that makes us better people. Do you agree? Say it again, I was petting the cat. Do you think I remember everything I say? The mind gets lost in these labyrinths. Life is full of adventures. There is no life without adventures. Each person has their own. Agathi wears black because of her soul. She uses it because she suffers. Her soul is black. People think there's something up there Giorgos, our loved ones. But there is nothing but air. The soul is here, the man is here, which soul is up there? What do we know about the soul? In an effort to be more outgoing and because they are lazy and not going anywhere for example, Stavroula could get on a plane and go to Belgium. We didn't get that chance, Alexander. So, to let you know what the rest of the world is like, I decided to bring the world here. That's good, so we don't have to move. Fifteen French students will come to visit us and in return, Greek students will come there. They will come to see a local production. So we have to think about the menu. 4,6,8,10,12, 14,16, 18 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34. There isn't enough. But the women will be out there and I'll be moving around. Should I throw them there? No French people have come to our village before. Here is like the end of the world. Like the small Welsh village in “Asterix”. How do we say “welcome” in French? Say it again. Yamoz hear children's voices. When I was at school, there were 30 of us. Good morning. Is this what I was trying to learn? Feet. All good. Cap. Take two aprons and go inside. And that. The next. For your shoes. In this area, we process the tomatoes. This is the result. That was the tomatoes section. And here is the honey section. That's right. Everyone will fill glasses. Like this. Perfect, perfect. Hello kids. How are you? Attention. This is the village school. It closed over 20 years ago. How many years? 30 years ago. Because people left the village and went to cities. So there are no children left here. Who's talking back there? This is the first time after 30 years that so many children have gathered in this place. Aunt, please get up. Now I'm going to show you the best student in the school. Aunt Agathi. FRAGILE -Hi, I'm Dennis. -Hey. -How are you? -Very good. The aim of this series of programs is to show success stories and show how Europeans and people from different countries can work together to improve something. to solve problems. And this one is... -This is too much... -Yes. They used to talk all the time, but now, they're quiet. I don't know. That's it for Germany. -So, you know, the labels... -They are the same. -They are the same. -In the windows. Honey is the same. It's a little How are your eyes? -Do we have thyme? -Yes. Then we add half a spoonful of marjoram and fennel seeds. Taste to see if it's strong. I would say half a teaspoon in each glass. -It's too strong. -And, half a teaspoon. I think it will be a great recipe. I agree. But how much should you add? Now you have to use your magic. But I did not understand. Are we making another income to support the project? -Do you believe that? -Yes, it's an easy recipe. -By then, tomatoes are profitable? -We try. -But they're not, are they? -No, they're not. And? If they aren't... we have to find out why. It's because it's expensive. -The tomato paste? -AND. Why is it expensive? - Why not be mass produced? -Yes. Should I hold like this? Like this? Or like this? I also have another one. Should I take this one? The climate here is hot, but it won't be so hot there. Take a long-sleeved jacket. This one has long sleeves. Should I take this one? It's lighter, it's better, it doesn't wrinkle. I also try other more formal ones! I'll wear athletic shoes, but should I bring those too? Should I wear high heels? I do not think so. -These socks? -No, I don't want them. Is it too cold there? Have a good trip. Enjoy and be careful. See, I also sinned these shoes. Beautiful! Junker will go crazy for you. Where am I going? Alex, I'm coming! I don't know where I'm going! -Have a good trip. -Thanks! Kiss your husband! Christo, I'm going to bring her back just like she is now. I want it better. Have a good trip. He's crying, he's sad. He was crying. He hugged her with tears streaming down his cheeks. They kissed. Why didn't you kiss your husband? -He kissed me. -But you didn't kiss him! - I kissed. -No! I was looking! But kissed. He also kissed you. I kissed your husband, but not you. -So what did you do for your husband? -Don't say that now! Incredible! This is the most beautiful. How did they build it? Does the king live there? I don't know, he might be in his summer palace right now. Look over there, the Greek flag! - Ours is the prettiest. -Look at those pretty colors. -We have the best colors. -Don't like the one on the right? Careful, Stavroula. -Nice shoes she's wearing! -Yes, with heels! I can't see the heels, your pants are covering them. -Welcome to Belgium. -It's good to be here! Let's find them. We'll find them, don't worry. -In the other “narrow way”. -Yes, the other one. -We lose? “We didn't go through the first hall. -Did they come in boxes? -Yes. Here they are! Here Alexander! Are here! But no stuffed tomatoes. -Why? -They must have run out. It says "lunch box" here. I mean, it's a complete meal. - Is that what it says? -Yes. Look over here, please. -Do you recognize these? -It's ours! Exactly. You are the ones who pick the tomatoes, right? In the field. -We do all... “Do the whole thing? -Yes. -No one else grows these tomatoes? No. And a village with 33 inhabitants. And half of them work with us. It's like a big family, you know? My aunt Katina is 82 years old. -82? -Yes! -Isn't it impressive? -And, yes, see them here! They were all made by our hands. They cost $5.99 euros. -Each one? -AND. But look, it's a whole meal. And it's organic! -It smells like... -Tomato! Reminds me of my grandma making tomato paste in the backyard. A kilo and a half of tomatoes for this little bottle? Totally unprofitable! Let me show you your products. This is your shelf. That! Now that you're here, we need to discuss the recipes. They need to know who the consumers of their product are. Can you make stuffed tomatoes with quinoa instead of rice? We can, but we need to test. We tested Stuffed Tomatoes for two years before we sold the first bottle. We don't have the name of the village, we don't have the name of the production people, we don't have the name of the tomato. “Do you know the story of this tomato? -No. You will really like the story. The tomato came to Europe with Christopher Columbus, you know? And 400, 500 years later we send this tomato to the US. Right, because everyone asks me the name of the tomato. They want to know who is behind the product. The production lacks a face. That is the problem. I told Costas. It won't work like that. It will be difficult now. That's what we're supposed to do, focus on meals. Focus on meals. And what is considered to be in fashion. Quinoa and barley are now all the rage. Superfoods are all the rage. But if they said to add that Argentinian cereal... -Where are we going to find him? -It's organic, we can buy it. Let's make a recipe like this. -Is their quality always the same? -The same. -Like wheat and barley? -More or less. What we have is this unique product. -Tomatoes. -And our raw material. -It's important to keep fighting. -I agree. In the big “food temples”, the so-called supermarkets, we have to call the consumer's attention. For an Englishman, this bottle will remind him of beer. So, probably, when he sees a shelf with jars of tomatoes and then this bottle, it will attract his attention. Then, if the price and the story behind it are good Just a little more. -Do you think we'll make it, Alexander? -I really do not know. The sun is setting. There is no future here. When the elderly, like me, die, their children will leave, they can't stay here. There is no life in our village. There is no life. Álekos only works with women. But what will happen next? Who will remain here? Stavroula and Niki. But how long will they keep working? He will have to find new people. It is also difficult for him. -Are these dried tomato seeds? -Yes. The smell is great! Are you sure Columbus brought them? I have, How much quinoa do we put in? That's the big question. Very little. Bring the quinoa for Aunt Katina to see. I think no more than a teaspoon per glass. That much? In every glass. "Is very little? “Put a tablespoon. -It's too much. -No, it is not. What is that? Put a big one! "Hang on. What is our objective? Buy'quinoa from Bolivia and make stuffed tomatoes here? No. The point is to write “quinoa” on the label! Yes, but it must be visible. I think it will show up when cooking. I also think. Do you taste the quinoa? It's nothing special. It really doesn't matter, Olga. So let's ditch plain quinoa and make one with quinoa and barley instead. In this way, we combine fashion and flavor! Aunt Katina should take the lead. And Aunt Agathi. And Niki. Come here, Stavroula, so we're not all in black. Here, Olga. I think we're fine now. We look at the camera and smile. Because they always ask who is producing those tomatoes. It's us! It's us! Aunt Katina. A little more cheerful, auntie. Let's go. I'm full of joy! - Aunt Agathi, come on. “I am the sad one. No no. It's beautiful, aunt. And now, comes our strength! Stavroula. DECORATE Ida rER This, just like a model. -Olga. - Show me my shoes, please. And the red band. And Niki. With my green shoes. Excellent! And you, boss. And Alexander. With a smile. There is a beautiful ancient myth of this plain... which says that at sunset, as now is the hardest time for people on Earth, the nymphs appear. Not scary nymphs. They meet travelers who are lost or who run home and ask them three questions. Really simple questions. The first question... "Who are you?" The second question... "Where are you?" The third question... "Where do you want to go?"
