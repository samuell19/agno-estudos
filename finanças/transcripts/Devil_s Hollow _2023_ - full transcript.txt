[shovelling] [crickets] - [Bobby] I don't know where to start, really. Hell, you don't even know me. So I don't expect you to forgive me for all the things I've done. - Bobby Hawkins. - Birdy. How about it, man? - Look at you, you look good, man. - Last I heard you were working over at the County Clerk's office - No, man, I got on over at the plant. Going on six years now. - Shit. - Worked my way up to Team Leader. - Good for you, man. Come on, you got what, 9, 10 kids now? - Three, two girls and a boy. Best things that ever happened to me. - I'm happy for you, brother. - Been doing good. Going out to First Baptist. Alyssa goes out there. You should come visit some time. You ever talk to her? - Alyssa? She don't want to talk to me. - You might be surprised. What's your plan then? - Just... don't go back. - That's a good plan. - Let me ask you something, Birdy. After all that went down, did you ever hear from Cofield? - You? I never could figure it out neither. We was like brothers. I always figured I'd hear from him some day. A letter or something. - He was the only one of us that got away. Sometimes I feel like he's in some sort of parallel universe sleeping like a baby on stacks of cash while we're stuck in this one. - Parallel universe, huh? Man, you was in there too long. Harry's done good for himself. Owns a bunch of restaurants, couple of bars, even ran for city commission. - Harry, huh. - Shoot. You, me, Cofield, Harry. We was something back in the day, wasn't we? The four horsemen. - Four stooges, more like it. - Ain't that the truth. It's good to see you, brother. - Hmm. - Battery is low, recharge now. (phone ringing) - Hey buddy. - Buddy? What is that, a joke? - Come on, man. - What you think that is? A toy, something to play with? - I just wanted some company. - Company? - It gets lonely out here, man. - Would you prefer LaGrange? Look, don't drag my black ass out here again. - I'm sorry. - I got things to do. - I know. - I'm busy. - I know. - You could have called. - You wouldn't have come. - How's Mrs. Whitaker? - Hell if I know. Hell, man, what did you do? - It's what I didn't do. I didn't listen. I didn't come home every night at 6:30. I didn't leave the toilet seat down. I didn't brush my teeth. How's it going looking for work? - Where am I supposed to go, huh? Mine's shut down, factory's full up. Hell, that's how I got in this mess in the first place. - Well, you gotta put some feelers out there. You know that was the deal. - Well, I got plenty to keep me busy around here. Look at this place. - Well, I might be able to help you out with that. I got a hand, he's a hard worker. You, you talk to Kelly? - What would I say? - She's still working down there at the Hideaway. - Hell, that place ain't burned down yet? - She still looks the same too. - I'm done with all that mess. - Yeah, you are. - Whole 'nother life. - Here's to a new one. - Let's do it. - Mr. Hawkins? - Como estas? - Bien, bien. - Whitaker send you? He says you need help. - All right, fellas. Your wife picking you up? - She takes the truck on Fridays. - Where to? - Cleans houses in town. - So you just got the one vehicle? - We make it work. - Well, I got an old beater out back. You get her running, she's yours. Been sitting there 20 years. - You're joking. - It ain't like I'm doing you a favor. It's a piece of shit. - Gracias. - What can I get you? You want a drink? - I wanna see her. - For what? - What do you think? She's my girl. - She ain't been yours for a long time. - Hell does that mean? I'm her daddy. - She's got a daddy, and it ain't you. - You seeing somebody? - That's none of your business. - Well, Lissy is my business. Where is she? - Hell, Bobby. That girl ain't lived with me in years. - Well, if she ain't living with you, where is she? - Harry took her in. - Harry. - Shit, Bobby, he's my brother. I was dead broke. I couldn't afford to raise her. She's better off. - What the hell is wrong with you? - You gonna come in here now like a concerned father and judge me? Get the fuck outta here Bobby. - Give me her number. - I ain't giving you shit. - This guy bothering you? - He's just leaving. - Not till I get that number. - It's time for you to move on, hoss. - Take it easy, big boy. - Bobby, here, just go. - Thought you'd beat me back? - Had some business. - I hope it was worth it. - Look, I ain't going nowhere. Hell, I'm right here, I'm just looking for my daughter. - Well, I could'a helped you with that. - Right, you didn't even tell me she was living with Harry. - I didn't want you to go out and do something stupid. Getting mixed up with Harry Casper again is something you don't need. You thought he was into bad shit back in the day, you should see the shit he's doing now. - I ain't getting mixed up with nobody. I'm just trying to see Alyssa. - It's been 10 years, why you care all of a sudden? - Fuck you, Whitaker. - See, you packing up the reasons why I should take you in. - You ain't going to take me in. - And why not? - As I recall, you helped me polish off a bottle of Beam the other night. Getting shit-faced with your parolee... ...ain't gonna look too good to your supervisor. - You asshole. - Let me go. - All right. Just this once. This shit happens again, blackmail ain't gonna help you. I can't protect you after this. - Let me get you a drink. - You asshole. - Look at you. Ain't changed a lick. Maybe a little uglier. Ain't you going to invite me in? - Hoo-wee, it's been a long time. So how long you been out and you ain't come to see me? - Been busy. - Hmm, that's what I hear. Kelly says you was down at the Hideaway, asking about Lissy. - How's she doing? - Just let me worry about her. Pere... Perelandra? You getting all egghead on me? Hey, you remember the time that we stacked all those beer cans up on your daddy's TV and then we took turns swinging at it? - Yeah, except you missed. Busted the shit outta your daddy's Magnavox. - He beat the tar outta me. How can I help you, Harry? - Oh, I'm glad you asked me that. You got something that belongs to me. - Money's long gone. Cofield took every penny. - Oh did he now? - I was there. I watched him cross over into Jellico. That's the last I seen him. - Well, now I know that's what you told the press and the cops. But, see, I never believed that story. Because, see, you was the greediest one of the whole bunch and there ain't no way in hell you would've let Cofield light out with all that cash. - I was scared, man. I figured that if he had the money, the cops would go after him and not me. I come home and there's a shit load of cherry-toppers in my driveway. - So he sold you out, huh? - Maybe. - That is about 10 pounds of horse shit in a 5 pound bag. I think you know exactly what happened. And it had nothing to do with Cofield riding off into the sunset, did it? - That was 13 years ago. That shit's over and done with. - You're a changed man. You and Birdy. Done found Jesus. You done got washed in the blood of the Lamb. See, the problem is, the blood doesn't wash away what you owe. - I ain't in debt to you. - Au contraire. See, we made a pact. We was all gonna split that money up four ways. Now, in my mind, when a man makes pact, it stands and it don't matter no nevermind how many years pass. - From what I hear, you own half the county. What do you need more money for? Look, I wish I could help you, Harry. - I'm gonna get my money. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But I'm gonna get what's mine. Whoa, you should have seen your face right then. - I'd like to see Alyssa. - Oh, I bet you would. - Look, I appreciate you helping her out and everything. - Helping her out? You make it, I don't know, sound like I just, I don't know, bought her some school books or shit like that. I raised that girl. - And I appreciate all you done. All the same... - You have a good day, Bobby boy. - How's it coming? - Levantando a los muertos. My daughter, she ain't picking up. - She probably don't know it's you calling. Don't have you saved on her contacts. How old is she? - Seventeen. - That's it then. Ninas don't talk anymore, they text. - Text? - Si, text. - Sweet pea? ...the hell? I gotta teach you everything? - I reckon. - Sweet pea... You know what my wife would've done if she seen that shit? - I thought she left you. - She came back. - Well, that's good, right? - And she checks my phone at least 12 times a day. So don't be sending me no more texts, okay. - So what do I do? - You gotta pull up the names on your contact list. Since you're an asshole, you ain't got no contacts. But I'm going to add a Alyssa under one condition. You got to promise me that you'll just keep this between you and Alyssa, understand? No Harry -- - What do I want with Harry? - Nothing. No how you doing? No long time no see, nothing. You have to promise that you're gonna keep this between you and your daughter. - Of course. - All right, she's in there now. So when you ready to send a message, all you gotta do is type the message and then click send. - Phones can do all kinds of things, huh? - Oh shit, you can watch TV, watch movies, play video games. You can check the weather in Beijing. - Why would I want to do that? - Well, I'm just saying you can do it. You can take pictures, record voices, just like -- - No shit, I ain't stupid. No shit, I ain't stupid. I really sound like that? - It's worse in person. - I am stupid. - All right, it's ready to send. - I think it worked. - You did it. - I did it. That's the hardest thing I ever did. - There's hope for you yet. - I'll try to give you details, but you know, I was kind of out of it. - Hmm. - It was a blur, but he got to wailing on me. So I grabbed my blade and I stuck him. - Did he leave anything else behind? - Nothing I seen. - Well, what do you think he was after? Drugs? Electronics? - Have you seen my TV? And no, I ain't got no drugs. - All right, well he was after something. Think you might have known him? Maybe one of those men you got working for you. - No, it wasn't them. I didn't see their face, but I know who sent them. Harry Casper. - Well, what makes you say that? - Cause he paid me a visit yesterday. Made some threats. - Such as? - Just that he wanted money and he was gonna get it one way or another. - Money... The First Federal money? - He thinks I still got it, but that was ages ago. Ricky Cofield took it back in the day. - Then why would Harry Casper come out here looking for it? - I don't know. - You get a good look at the truck? - Dodge Ram, I think. - Ram... License plate? - Truck was blue, I saw that. Hey, are you kin to Dick Gray? - My uncle. - I thought you favored him. Old Dick hauled me off to county more times than I care to admit. How's he doing? - He passed. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do the best I can with the information you've given me and the evidence that we collected. - So, that's it? What am I supposed to do? Just hang out like a lump on a log? Wait for them to come back? - Maybe they won't. - Oh they will, sure as shit. Harry don't quit when he wants something. - That's assuming that Harry is behind -- - I have no doubt. - Then I suggest you get yourself a good home security system. - That's it? - Unless you wanna give me the whole story, Mr. Hawkins, there ain't a lot more that I can do. - The whole story, I told you everything. - Okay, well I can't figure why you'd insist that Harry Casper is hellbent on harassing you if there ain't more to it all. - I am the victim here. - I'll write it up. - You do that. - Have a good one. - Shit. - Well? - Well, he thinks Casper's involved. - What do you think? - I don't know yet. - What's to know? ♪ There is power, power ♪ ♪ Wonder working power ♪ ♪ In the blood of the Lamb ♪ ♪ There is power, power ♪ ♪ Wonder working power ♪ ♪ In the precious blood of the Lamb ♪ - Folks say to me, "Pastor, what I do in private is my own business.

Something I can do for you? - Next time you want to send a message, you might wanna bring it yourself instead of sending your boys. - That's the Bobby I remember. - Take care of yourself now. - Bobby!

We got any sippy cups? - Heard you paid your old buddy Bobby Hawkins a visit. - Not against the law, is it? - No. He said you made him some threats. Funny thing is he was assaulted outside his home later that night. Any connection there? - You tell us, you're the police. - What happened here? - Fell outta my tree stand. - What were you doing in your tree stand? - I was trying to bag an eight pointer. What do you think? - It ain't deer season. - Well... I was... - Trevor, shut up. - Hawkins said he saw a vehicle leaving the scene, a blue pickup, kind of like that one out front. Does that seem odd to you? - A blue pickup in Franklin County? No, it doesn't. - Girl, you gonna do anything or just harass us? - Funny you should ask... One of the intruders left some blood on Hawkins' lawn. Lab has it now. Same lab that has your sample from the rape charge back in '16. So I find a match between that sample and the one from Hawkins' lawn. Then, yeah, I'm gonna do something. I don't know what grievance you still have with Bobby Hawkins, but you keep poking him and you're bound to stir up a shit storm. It's not gonna be good for anybody. Hawkins is just trying to start over up there. You leave him alone. - Let me get this straight, are you suggesting we throw him a housewarming party? - I told you, Harry. Don't make me tell you again. - Baby. - Momma. - You want something to eat? - I'm good. - Help me out here. - This a new one? - I've done this one before. For some reason, it just never gets any easier. - Ask you a question? - Yeah, fire away. - My dad... what's he like? - What's he like? Well, he was up at LaGrange for about 10 years and never lifted a finger to contact you. What's that tell you? - I remember, though, when I was just little, he used to play the harmonica to help me fall asleep. Remember that? - Yeah. Well. - I think I wanna talk to him. - Suit yourself. You're gonna be disappointed. - Right. Well... I'll leave you to it. - Well, hey, you just got here. Stay and help me. - I got some things to do. - What do you got to do? Hey... You got anything? - I ain't got nothing. - Bullshit. I know Harry hooks you up. Come on, baby... just a little something? - Sorry, momma. - Hell, my dad's been locked up a bunch of times. - At least you know him. - I guess. - Is he cool? - I don't know. He's all right. At least your dad's trying. I mean, he called you. - So, what, you'd call him back? - All right. One for you, one for me. All right. So... You look so big. - I ain't a baby no more. - Thanks for coming. - So you really can't go nowhere? - Ah... grocery and church. - That's about all. Rat in a cage. - Sweet pea... Why'd you call me that? - Your momma never told you? - She never talked much about you. - Well, when you were born, we wrapped you up and you looked just like a little pea in a pod. So... How's Harry treating you? - All right. To tell you the truth, I ain't really sure why I'm here. - Hey, you like books? - Sure. - I read a lot in LaGrange, as you might imagine. You like science fiction? That Harry Potter shit? - I like fantasy. - Oh, shit, I got that. There's this space trilogy. You'd love it. There's this kid who goes to Mars and finds out that Earth has been cast out of the solar system. This guy, Ransom, he fights an evil force to restore Earth. Let me see... listen to this. "The smells in the forest were beyond all that he had ever conceived. To say that they made him feel hungry and thirsty would be misleading. They created a new kind of hunger and thirst, a longing that seemed to flow over from the body into the soul..." What's the matter? - I gotta go. - I'd like to see you again. I mean, if you want. Well, at least take the book, it's good. - Hell is this? - A book. - Oh, no shit. Where'd you get it? Went and seen him, didn't you? Now what did I tell you about that? - I just -- - Oh I just, I just what? Let me ask you something. Who do you think it was that kept a roof over your head, ever since you was yay high? See, I know what is best for you. And he's got nothing to say in the matter. Now what part of that does your little pea brain not understand? - I just wanted to meet him. - What for? - I got a right. - You what? - I got a right to see him if I want. - Oh, you got a right... You got a right to do exactly what I say. - Screw you, Harry. - Now listen, everything you got, everything you are is because of me, and don't ever forget it. - How you doing, Mr. Hawkins? - I'm doing. - Your daughter around? - Why? - Apparently, she ran off last night. - Well, she hadn't come around here. You check with her mother? - Yeah, she ain't been by there neither. But I wouldn't worry. - You wouldn't, huh? - No, you know how kids are. She probably got pissed at Harry and ran off to a friend's for a few days. But she comes by, you let me know, okay? - Shit. - Give it a couple days, she'll show up. - Hell, it's my fault, I let Harry raise her. I got no right to be concerned. - Sure you do, she's your kid. I need your help, Birdy. You're right. Alyssa is my blood, I don't care if I'm stuck out here. I ain't gonna let him hurt her. - What do you need me to do? - I need you to go to Harry and tell him he don't run things no more. - Bobby, I don't want to get caught up in no war. - Just give him the message. You owe me that. - Have a seat, Birdy. So, you come here to save my soul? - Ain't nothing like that. - That's good cause you'd be wasting your time. But now you gotta tell me why you're here wasting mine. - Bobby Hawkins sent me. - You're Bobby's pigeon now. - He'd have come himself if he could. - You got balls, Birdy, I'll tell you that, you do. But, you know, coming here on Bobby's behalf, I can't tell whether that's really brave or really stupid. - Bobby's just worried about his little girl is all. - Sounds like an accusation. - Nothing like that. - Well then, tell me what it is like, Birdy. - Bobby just don't think she's safe here is all. - Well, that's none of Bobby's business. Sure as hell ain't none of yours. - Shoot, Harry. Back in the day, he took the fall for all of us. If it hadn't been for Bobby, you and me both would've done a lot more time than we did. We all robbed that place. But you and me did three piddly years. Knowing that he was in there that whole time, I don't know about you, but that killed me. - So, what, you think we owe him something? Let me ask you something, Birdy. You say Bobby's so concerned about his little girl. Just exactly what does he intend to do about it? - He just says to tell you that he ain't afraid to tussle if it comes to that. Listen, I ain't trying to stir nothing up. It's what he said. - Come in my house uninvited. Call me an unfit guardian. Pass along a threat. And you ain't trying to stir nothing up? - You ain't my enemy, Harry. - Birdy, Birdy... I really thought you were smarter than this, I really did. I mean, you went and got yourself on the straight and narrow but you haven't got the sense God gave a three-legged coon dog who's lost his nose and ought to be put down. - Please don't shoot the messenger. - Don't worry, Birdy... I ain't gonna shoot you. - To think we used to be friends. - Stooges. - What? - Stooges. - Boys, show him what we do to uninvited guests. - Morning. What are you girls doing? - Just walking. - Why don't you get in the car? - We ain't done nothing. - Oh, you're not in trouble. I promise. There's some people worried about you. Come on. Mr. Hawkins. - What's going on? - We, uh... we pulled Lawrence Birdwhistle's car out of Benson Creek this morning. - Where is he? - He was inside, he was beat to death. His wife said y'all spoke the other day. What'd you talk about? - You think I had something to do with it? - No one is saying that. - Birdy was my friend. If you want to know what happened to him, why don't you ask Harry Casper? - I intend to. - And why aren't y'all out there looking for my daughter? - Alyssa's home, I picked her up this morning. She's over at Harry's now. - Hell, then she's in more trouble than she ever was. - Harry Casper is her legal guardian, there is nothing we can do about that. - There's nothing you can do about anything, is there? What good are them badges if y'all are all working for Harry? - Well, what good is this badge if you won't tell me what you know that'll help me bring him in? - I told you... I ain't hiding nothing. - Sorry to hear about your friend. - Who knows what he's gonna do next? I gotta get Alyssa out of there. - And how you gonna do that? The second you leave, every black and white in the county is gonna be on your ass. What good you gonna do her back in prison? - I gotta do something. - Bobby, let the cops take care of this. - The cops. - They're your best friends right now. - Some friends. - Let them do their job. - They did their job, and Birdy's dead. I ain't gonna sit around and wait for the same thing to happen to Alyssa. - You ain't got a lot of options. - I thought you were on my side. - I ain't on nobody's side. My job is to keep you out of prison, that's it. These days, you ain't making that very easy. - Alyssa? It's your... Bobby Hawkins. Listen, can you come out here? I'd like to talk to you. Yeah. - What do you want? - Listen, I know Harry's got a hold on you. Believe it or not, he had the same hold on me back in the day. - Nobody's got no hold on me. - Then get out of there. - And go where? - Here. Come stay with me. You'll be safe. - I don't even know you. - For the longest time, I sat up there in that rock thinking I wasn't worthy or something to be your daddy, you know? Like you were better off without me. Figured you felt the same, so I stopped writing. - You never wrote me. - I wrote you two years straight. - I never got no letters. - You may want to ask your mom about that. All I'm asking is that you give me a chance. - You had your chance. Harry's right, he's the only one ever gave a shit about me. - Harry only cares about Harry. - Cares more than you ever did. Ever since you come around, everything's gone to shit. And I don't want no part of it. - What do you want? - I just want things to go back to normal. - Back to him smacking you around? - You don't get it, do you? I'm glad you got that thing on your ankle. I don't ever wanna see you again. I don't want you to call me. You was never my dad and you're never gonna be. - What's on your mind, sugar? - I know you're working for Harry. They got you keeping an eye on me. It's all right. You're just doing what you gotta do. - Bobby... - You know what's fucked up? I had a plan. Soon as I got out, I was gonna get what was mine and get the hell outta here and never look back. Then I saw Alyssa and all this shit went down. I thought I never wanted to see her again, but I was wrong. I just didn't know it. You got kids? - Two. Boy and a girl. - So you know. - Everything I do is for them. - They ever have bad dreams? - About every other night. - I have this dream sometimes. I'm underground, buried but I'm still alive. And these snakes break through the dirt and they wrap around me. The crazy thing is, I don't try to fight it. - What do you mean? - I deserve it. I belong there with the snakes. - You done your time. What are you still paying for? - What are you still doing here? - Oh, what you, you want me to go? - I mean here in Devil's Hollow. If you could get outta here, go anywhere, what would you do? - Pack up my kids. Go down to Clearwater. - Do it. - I can't. - Take your kids, and get outta here. - You just going to up and skedaddle, huh? - I'm tired of all this. - Well, at least have one last drink with your boy. - I really gotta go. - Sit. What in that pretty little head of yours makes you think it's going to be that easy? You owe me. - I done paid you everything I owe. We're square. - We're square when I say so. - I'm serious, Trevor. - Oh, I know you are. - Don't! - Now, where'd you get this? - Hawkins gave it to her. - Oh hell yeah. - Hello? Alyssa? Hello? Shit. - Help! - Alyssa! - Hey, Bobby boy. I know you got my money. You wanna see Lissy again, you're gonna bring me that cash. - Alyssa! - I'll kill this little bitch, Bobby. You know I will, just like I done Birdy. - You touch her, I will rip your fucking throat out! - Oh, I'd like to see that. Thirty minutes. Old Crow Quarry. Show up a second late, well, you know what happens when you disappoint. - Alyssa! Shit! - Bobby. - Hey, buddy. - Sheriff's got the whole damn county looking for you. You're not getting away. - I ain't trying to. - Well, then stop. Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out. - Harry's got Alyssa. He's gonna kill her if I don't get there. - Where? I'll come to you. Where you going, Bobby? - Here it is. - Hell yeah, it is. Been waiting a long time for that. - Hand her over. - Hey, girl, come on out of the car. You always were a dumb son of a bitch. She duped you. She lied to you. It's the only way I could get you to come out here. Oh, Bobby, I knew you had this money. Cofield, he never ran off to Jellico, did he? - We were fighting over the cash. Before I knew it, he drew on me so I shot him first. - Ha! Damn, son. - And you killed Birdy. - Well, I ain't gonna lie about it, it was unfortunate. But had to be done though, I guess. - He was a good man. He didn't deserve to be beat like a dog. - Bobby, in this world nobody gets what they really deserve. - So, it's just the two of us -- - Bobby, you really are a dumb son of a bitch. Say hello to Birdy and Cofield for me. - Stop! - Oh, now you're gonna shoot me? - Drop it. - Or what? You're not gonna shoot anybody. Adios, Bobby. - Put it down. - Bobby, you hold on, you hold on now, you hold on. - Probation 45, shots fired! I have two suspects down. I need backup and medical services now. - You was right. These things can do it all nowadays. We were fighting over the cash. Before I knew it, he drew on me so I shot him first. - Ha! Damn, son. - And you killed Birdy. - I ain't gonna lie about it, it was unfortunate. But had to be done though, I guess. - He was a good man. He didn't deserve to be beat like a dog. - Bobby, in this world nobody gets what they really deserve. - [Bobby] I don't know where to start really. Hell, you don't even know me. So I don't expect you to forgive me for all the things I've done.
