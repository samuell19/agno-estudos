You sure took your sweet time. I got tired of waiting for you. Sam sit down. They're not going to miss us. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Looks like we found our leak. Pressures down in 47. Just another day on the job. Where'd you get that? Peter sent it with the last shipment. My bro's saying they're growing tobacco down at the stations now. Remind me why we're still working at this shithole? Man, that's good. Yeah, it is right? Too good. Yeah. [SIGHS] I can't believe you're still doing that. Well, nobody's offering to do it for me. Jesus. MAN: Hey, who's there? Sam. We're back from 47. MAN: And who's with you? It's Troy. MAN: All right, come on through. [BUZZER SOUNDS] One of these days I'm gonna shove that light up his ass. Fix your doors, man. FOREMAN: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, same shit different day. Lebowski brothers, you're still on tunnel 57. Reaper, Horn, Church, you're on 42. Hey. Sam, Troy, where you two been? What's happening on pipe 47? Pressures down. There's a leak somewhere, probably in the shaft. Well, that's your pump. Go ahead and fix it. Now? Yeah, right now. Hey, we've been following these pipes for hours. It is going to rain in a couple of days. I want that pipe fixed. No excuses. Now get going. Do we at least get proper tools this time? You will use the tools that you got. Yeah, well, they're shit. You know, on second thought, why don't I give you all the provisions you need. And while I'm at it why don't I lick your ass? Come on! Let me explain something to you. You will use the tools that you got and you will get going. I've got a bunch of guys who would love a job at this station. Fuck knows, could use more coal shifters down at station 5. Look, it's just the two of us. And if it's as bad as I think it is, it'll be a five man job, at least. Rose. Get over here. Join these two monkeys. What? Her? She's a kid, for Christ sake. We need someone with more experience. She's all I can afford. Get over there. [LAUGHING] Is this a fucking joke? Hey. Hey. You got a mask in there? Yeah. Good. You'll need it. Stay close. FOREMAN: Thirty-one. [WATER FLOWING] [♪♪♪] Beautiful. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Pity. Have a look over here. How deep is it? [SCOFFS] Pretty deep. Do you know what it was used for? Ventilation or cooling shaft. I mean, we can't go down there anymore, it's all flooded. And these pipes and things? How long have they been here? Ever since we found the place. Okay, so listen up, kid. There's three major pipe lines that come in here that bring in the water. Those over there bring in the water from tunnel 47, these over here bring up the trapped rain water. Those pipes over there bring in the water from our rain catchers that we've assembled. You know, this is the heart of everything. That's why we've got to monitor the flow rate. To do that we use, these gauges over here. Shit. Troy. Yeah? I'm gonna need my tool belt. Looks like a rock fell through the shaft during the last storm and damaged one of the pipes. Yeah. Makes sense. You wanna give it a go? You'll be okay. Don't worry about it. Hey, Rose. Keep your eye on Sam, okay? Okay. MAN [OVER RADIO]: Mike, come in. Mike? Come in. Hey Mike, you there? Mike come in. Yeah, what's up? Alex with you, you seen him? Nah, he ain't with me. Saw him pass through a couple hours ago. Yeah, I sent him up there to fix the communications line haven't been able to talk to any of the other stations for two days now. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I heard about that. Listen, what do you want me to do? We need those lines back up. We got the supply train here ready to leave, can you go look for him and find out what is taking so goddamn long. Sure, okay, but you owe me. [OBJECT THUNKS] [♪♪♪] Hey Al? Al? You in here, man? That you, man? [GURGLING, CLICKING] What the...? [SNARLS] [SCREAMING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, Sam? Thanks for letting me help out back there. You guys think I could work with you again? I could really use the experience. It's not my call, kid. I'm sure if you spoke to the foreman. Look, I'm not going to speak to anyone, all right. Please? I want to learn. How long you been here? At this station? Two days. Two days? You hear that, Troy, two days. [TROY WHISTLES] How'd you end up here? I was working at Winnipeg station, wasn't much good at helping out with the plantations so, they sent me here. Well, guess what, you mess up here, next stop they'll have you digging up coal. You got a bed? Not yet. Well, we've got upstairs, and downstairs. Hey Sam, Troy. Chris. Yeah, so the boss wants to see you guys... Again? Yeah. Station two power issues. Come on Chris, it's the third time this month. I didn't break it. We'll be right up. Thanks, Chris. Cool. You stay here. Ah. Sam and Troy. Come on in. Jack, what's news? Ah, same old shit. Winnipeg is having problems again. Yeah, well, I'm not surprised, those lines are ancient. I've lost count how many times I've suggested we replace them. We'll get to that, but right now, I need you to get out there and jumpstart that station. The supply train is stuck there, we got produce we gotta move. When did this happen? Two days ago. That's a bit long, don't you think? Look, we gotta get that train back up on the main line. Obviously, Winnipeg just don't have the manpower to get the damn thing back up. You know their setup there. Well, I gotta use you. What about the water pumps here? Rains are coming. Well. Troy can watch 'em while you're gone. What, what? No. No, no. I'm going with Sam. I'm not here to argue with you, Troy. You got a job to do here. I can't afford to let two men go with the rains coming. My brother's at that station, Sam. Troy. I need proof that he's okay. I'm going... I'm going with Sam! I've made my decision, Troy, and it is final! Yes, sir. He is getting worse. Yeah, well, he hasn't seen his brother in a while, he's just worried. So, what's the plan? Well, I've organized for some guys from station six to meet you, uh... over here. Hey. Sam. You're an idiot if you think I'm going to let you come with me. Sam, Peter's up there. I know. Two days. Two days, with no communication from that station, you don't find that a bit odd? Yeah. I do. But we need those pumps running when it rains. They can get somebody else, Sam. Troy. I'm sorry, it's out of my hands. All right. Okay. Happy birthday, John. Thanks, dad. So how's your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. Yeah, sure. SAM: She's hot, right? JOHN: Yeah. ANNA: Wake up. Wake up. Wake up... Wake up... You're back? I missed your smile. I can't stay. Wait. Wait. Don't go. I can't. Anna... I can't. Anna, don't go! Anna! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] Hey. Look, I thought about it and... You can come with me. Thought I had to look after your stupid pump. Yeah, well, I need someone to carry the battery packs. Can you, just turn that up. Troy... What do you think about the girl? Rose. What do you mean what do I think about her? I feel sorry for her. I think we should train her. No. I'm not babysitting a kid. She could use the experience. It's not my problem. Look, you asked me to come. So you in or not? I'm in... but you know something, Sam? You need to stop being such a goddamned tight-ass. Yeah, well, you need to stop... We'll leave first thing in the morning. [BELCHES] I'll have another. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you two headed off to? We're on a maintenance call at station two. Says here only Sam is on call, nothing about a hop-a-long. [LAUGHS] Yeah, that's a mistake. You wanna call that in? [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Jesus, Troy. What you do that for? After you. Which way? I think it's through there. Yeah. [EXHALES] I hate this place. Okay. So we're here, right? Yeah. Take the tunnel to the right... follow the golden line for one, two, three, four... Nine Junctions. All right. [OBJECT CLUNKS] Who's there? Hey, come on out. This is not a fucking joke! It's the kid. What are you doing here? I told you to stay back at Kentucky station. Let me come with, please. I just thought I could watch you guys, you know. Please. I won't get in your way, I promise. Hey, you gotta admit she's got balls. I said no. Sam, let her come with. We're wasting time here. All right. But you stay with Troy, and you only speak when you're spoken to. Are we clear? She's your problem. I'll look after her, I promise. Hey, don't worry too much about him, all right. Keep up. Keep up. Keep up. Jack you got a moment? Yeah, come in. We, uh... got ourselves a little problem. What problem? Troy didn't arrive for his shift today. From what I hear, he's left with Sam. Why am I not surprised? What makes you think he's gone off with Sam? One of the guards got a broken nose trying to stop him this morning. [SCOFFS] Typical. Listen, I want you to close all the tunnels now. No one comes in or out until this Winnipeg situation has been resolved. You're locking down the entire station, why? This just came in from one of the rangers. [♪♪♪] Looks like this is it. Sam... Okay, so where are our guides? You Sam? Yeah. They told me there would only be one. Yeah, well, things have changed a little. Is that gonna be a problem? [FLASHLIGHT CLICKS] No problem. This is Troy, and the kid is Rose. You guys expecting a fight? We're just here as security. You get the power up, train running. We make sure everything's okay. Is there a reason to believe something might not be okay? Some of our guys saw bandit activity in this sector, we're here to keep you kids safe. Yeah? Yeah. Look, we don't have a lot of time we should get moving. You good to go? Yeah. All right. I'll brief you on the way. Okay. This is it. There's been no movement since we got here over a day ago. It's a ghost town. We tried banging on the door but... Yeah, well, it's a pretty big door. Do you know how to get it open? Yeah, we can get it open. Well, be my guest. [WHISPERS] I don't trust any of this. Me neither, but let's just open the door, all right. You guys need my help with anything? [SIGHS] Yeah, hold this. Yeah, I got a charge running through. We've got a charge... just push the button, and she'll open up. Ghost, open the door. Khan, you're with me. You three hang back. [ALERT BEEPING] [♪♪♪] Looks like nobody's home. Yeah, you two go search out anyone still here and maintain radio contact. Troy. Okay, we gotta go get that supply train up and running. Think you can help me with that? Yeah. No, whoa. Why is there nobody here? My guys are gonna find them. Where is everybody! Relax! They're probably holed up deeper in the base. Ghost and Khan will find them. We have to get that train running. Let's go. Troy. Come on. Come on! [♪♪♪] All clear. KHAN [OVER RADIO]: Zero, moving down to lower level. Top level is clear. Keep looking. Ventilation is still working. Where the fuck is everyone? Looks like everybody left in a hurry. [INHALES] Jesus, it smells like fucking shit in there. Looks like a fight broke out here. Last stand, if you ask me. Khan, door. Break it. Check him. Gimme light. Check his hands. Generator is up. Engines ready to fire. Good. KHAN: Zero, we got a survivor here. Status? He's alive, but on the edge. Wake up, buddy. Come on, buddy, speak to me. What happened here? Ghost, watch the corridor. Come on, speak to me. We're here to help you. Can you tell me what happened here? [CLANKING] We got incoming! Fuck, it's just the damn maintenance guy. Where is he? [EXHALES SHARPLY] You know him? No, no. And? He's just dehydrated. All right, let's move him. There's a medbay back there. Hey. Don't pull that shit again, okay? Yeah. Let's move. Okay, wake him up and try find out what happened here, but make it fast, we gotta get back to the train. His name is Fowler. How do you know that? She used to work here. He's one of the guys that worked in the greenhouses. Why didn't you tell us you used to work here before we came in? Didn't think you needed to know. It's pretty damn important. I don't know. Seems like you guys are the ones holding back on some important information. You just show up here with all these guns. What the hell is going on here? Get us on the same page for Christ sake. Zero. What? You gotta see this. Just wake him up. TROY: Nobody... is going anywhere... until somebody tells me what the hell is going on here! Whoa, okay, guys. Just calm down. Khan, lower that fucking thing. Look. I don't know what's going on here, yet. But if you follow my lead, we'll figure it out, all right? Where's my brother? I don't know where your brother is. Peter! Shut up. Peter! Shut up or I will shut you up. I don't know where your brother is. That's why we here. Khan, me, Ghost, we're here to help you. Troy? You okay? No, no, I'm not okay. Look, his brother worked at this station. I get it, but I can't tell you where his brother is because I honestly don't know. Bandits, seriously? Zero. Be right back, Sam. Wake him up. [♪♪♪] [RASPY BREATHING] Ghost, gimme your radio. You two go back to the train, get it started. It should be good to go. We are leaving now, quietly. Sam, come in. Sam, come in, goddamn it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Fowler! Fowler calm down these men are here to help you. Get away! We're not going to hurt you. Who are you people? Shut him up. FOWLER: Hey! Hey! Stay away from me! Shit! Get back here, you little shit! Let me go! Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth! [SHRIEKING] Just be cool, just be cool, all right? They're coming back. They're coming back. Shit. Stop him! Who? Who's coming back? Let me go. Please, let me go. They will kill us all. You have to let me go. The dead are alive. What are you talking about? Bad news, we're leaving. Khan we got trouble. You got that train up and running? KHAN: Almost. Hurry. You take the front, I'll take the back. Aim for the head. Let's move, people. They're all around us. What? Who's all around us? You see anything that isn't us. You shoot it. Is that clear? We need to contain this. Contain what? ZERO: No time. Follow Ghost when it's clear and get the girl out of here. Hey stop! Come on! Wait! Kid! Hey, kid! Help me get this open! Hey kid! Kid, come on, open the door! [SNARLING] [SCREAMING] Back the way we came. We'll have to go around. Let's move! Let's move! [♪♪♪] [SNARLING] Stop! There's no time. Girl, where's your rear load bay? It's closed. We don't use it. Show me. Khan, get that train outta here, we are not coming with you. We're not going with him? There's another way. No one's been in those tunnels in years. I have, circle round to station five in the south. We've got no choice. Let's go! Troy, come on. Ghost, you have our back. We're leaving. This way! Shit! Power? Damn, we left the battery pack behind. No. These doors, we can open these manually. Hurry! Sam, to me! I'm empty! How many? Too many to count. How'd they get in? We must have missed something. Remember, shoot to kill. They're not human. I'm out. Go help Troy. Ghost, you're up. It's opening! Come on. Reload! How's that door coming? It's open. Go! Go! Come on! Get him out there! Get him out there! Fuck! Come on. That won't hold them long. You okay? I'm fine. We keep moving. [BANGING] [♪♪♪] Hold up. You sure you're okay? I'm fine. [SNARLING IN DISTANCE] They'll be on us soon. That wasn't from behind us. We have to backtrack. D4 leads around, but it's probably where these things are coming from. Take D7. Go topside. Are you fucking crazy? Nobody's been topside in eight years. Look, where do you think these things come from, huh? My gear, the equipment my crew's got. It's all from topside. I knew it. What have I been telling you, Sam, all this time. What's the point in keeping us underground? Trust me, it's better down here. And you, my job. The ranger's job, is to keep the tunnels clear, check the surface entrances, and scavenge for equipment from above. We've been able to contain them this long. Something must have lured them down here. That's the big secret, right? And if anybody finds out about that secret you, what? You make the problem go away. You ghost them, right? They're offered a choice. Join the rangers or leave for good. And if they don't like your choice? I don't kill innocent people if that's what you mean. You sure? Troy. Troy, this isn't helping. You sure? Yeah. This isn't helping. We gotta stay focused. We gotta keep going. You know the way? We're trusting you guys. Sure, you are. SAM: How far does this tunnel go? ZERO: Couple more crossroads till we get where we're going. TROY: Where exactly are we going? ZERO: Unfinished bunker complex, should get us topside. SAM: The network. How big is it? Big, too big. There other stations as well. After Winnipeg, next is three days to the north, but we just trade with them. They mind their business, we mind... [SNARLING NEARBY] Get behind me now. Lights off. [WHISPERS] When I say so, run. The light, it mesmerizes them. It should buy us some time. Run! Shit! Go up this way. Move. Let's move! I've got this, get them out of here. Troy, go. Give me a gun. Troy? It's his choice, Sam. Let's go. Troy! [♪♪♪] Troy! Come on! ZERO: We're not out of the woods yet. Let's hustle. [♪♪♪] Where are we? Bunker complex built for surviving the meteors. Never finished it in time, though. Stairs are this way. You okay? Ghost knows the way. We have to keep moving. Those things... what happened to them? The meteors, they had, uh... a virus, a kinda fungus that eats away at the brain stem. Eventually, the host loses all control. You got a name for them? Frenzied. Great. We have to come up here every couple of weeks. Check the shaft entrances, try lure the herds away. Keep an eye out for bandits. So you've been able to come up here all this time? For the first year no one could. After that, it was risky. The environment's changed. Weird storms. I still carry a gas mask. So, what do we do now? Head west. And then we hit a railroad track and follow that south. Why go back? You can't stay here. Why not? Look, I know all of this is beautiful to you, but topside's dangerous. Same as down there? Down there we have rules... up here is not the same. Why have we never seen these things before? ZERO: Because... there a lot more guys like me keeping the tunnels clear. So you've known about these things all this time, and just kept it from us? Do the station leaders know about it? Son of a bitch. Eat up. And you two get some rest. It's a long walk back. I'll take first watch. [♪♪♪] [BLOWS] [WINCES] [BIRD CHIRPING] Sam. Sam! [♪♪♪] Wait outside. Come on, kid, gotta keep moving. [♪♪♪] Stay there. [♪♪♪] I found a letter. Dates back nearly eight years ago. "Fred. We've gone to my mother's. The army said to get away from all the populated areas. They're trying to force us into some kind of controlled quarantine or something. Massive tents and makeshift camps. They're burning the bodies of the infected. I can't let the boys see what's happening here." My parents farm seems to be the safest place. We waited as long as we could. Come as soon as you can. We love you. Debby and the boys." We can stay here for the night. [DOOR CLOSES] [LATCH CLICKS] Take the couch. I'll keep watch. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] ANNA: Sam... I can't stay, Sam. [THUDDING] [♪♪♪] [WHISPERING] Rose, get down. Sam, no. [BOTTLE CLATTERS] Shh. Be quiet. [GUNSHOT] [MOUTHS] Be quiet. Shh. Jesus. Sam, no. [SNARLING] Oh, Jesus. Those things... Get your things. We gotta get out of here. Get your things! Come on. Rose, come on. Sam, don't leave me. Rose, wait until I call you. Okay, kid, come on. Run. No. Rose. Run, come on. No, Sam. Sam, no. Sam, no. No, Sam. Come on. Sam, no. Fuck! Rose, get inside that building. Rose, come on! Get inside! I need something to jam the gate. Rose, hurry up! Hurry up! Here. It'll hold. Come on! Come on! I got it. Rose, we gotta go. Go! [PANTING] What the hell is wrong with you? What? You almost got us killed back there. When I say run, you run. When I tell you to do something, you do it. Okay? Yes, Sam. Because had you listened to me, we wouldn't have had to run for our lives. I mean, what happens if that gate didn't close back there? We'd be dead right now! I'm sorry! I was scared, all right? It's all right. Come on. [♪♪♪] Find anything useful in there? Some books. Books? Yeah. What kind of books? You mean, like comics? No. Proper books. Proper books. Heh. You ever read a book? Yeah. You ever read this? Black Beauty. Can't say I have. When I was younger, my mom used to read it to me. Teach us how to be a good person. You remind me of one of the characters in the book. Really? What's this character's name? Captain. Captain? Captain of what? He's an old war horse. [SCOFFS] A horse? All the main characters in the book are horses. Sounds like a stupid story to me. You'd enjoy it. Really? You should read it. Yeah, I don't know about that. Why not? It's a great story. I'm sure it is. Look, Rose. Let's just carry on looking for this railway, all right? Is this it? About time. Which way? South. [SIGHS] What are you doing? Come on, Sam, just sit. Rose. What's the big hurry? [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] It feels like we could live up here. It's almost as if none of this ever happened. You know? Almost. Yeah. Almost. ROSE: Sam? SAM: Hmm? What did you do before all this happened? I used to work for an engineering company. And your family? What were they like? Really? Come on, Sam. There's no point holding it all in. Where's your family now? Not so nice is it? My dad was the one that took us to the subway. He was prepared. Always knew something would happen. He always said how... if we stay together... everything would be all right. That if we were together... we'd always have hope. You know? He was so good to us. So good to me. And then he got sick. Her name is... Her name was Anna. She was so beautiful. And I had a son too. Little John. How old was he? Thirteen. What happened to them? I couldn't save them. It's gonna be dark soon. Still need to find a place to take camp for the night. Let's hurry up. Good story, huh? It's okay. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I forgot the smell of rain. I thought you catch rain at your station. It's different down there. Out here it's... It's more alive. What happens when we get back? I don't know. [RUSTLING] The bridge Zero was talking about... It's not far now. Sam. We're going the right way. No, Sam, look. Oh, God. SAM: Rose, get behind me. That's close enough. Hey, man. Look, I could really use your help right now. I got a friend down the ways here, he's hurt bad. That's none of our business. Now move along, friend. Really? Wow. You just gonna leave my friend back there? We're good people, man, in need of help. He's not even far from here. He's just up the way. We can't help you. Move on. Hey, look, man, I can't go back, man. He's dying, man. He's bleeding out. Sam, maybe we can... No. Listen to the girl, man. I even got food back at the camp. I'll be happy to share it with ya. Sam he really looks like he need... He's fine. Where you from? North? South? Look, that don't even matter, I'm sure you need to get to where you need to be but, you know, I could really use a friend right now. Look. This is the last time, I'm asking you to move along. And the next time, I'm taking you down. Okay, calm yourself, buddy. I'm gonna go now, just... Just calm yourself. If you change your mind, there, we'll be just up the road. Come here, sweetie. [GASPS] Leave her alone! Put the gun down or die where you stand. [ROSE WHIMPERING] Put it down! Keep still. ROSE: Sam! Give it! Give it. What you got in here? Nothing but shit. Tie him up. ROSE: Sam! Get that son of a bitch. Sam! Sam! Shut your mouth! Fuck him. Let's go back. Where do you come from? Your camp? Is it close by? I see you like to read. I do as well. It is so sad that these beautiful words will be lost to this world. May I trade you? I have a collection upstairs. A myriad of prolific writers. Could I have this one? You're just gonna keep it anyways. Thank you... for speaking to me. I must apologize for the way my men treated you when they brought you here. But we are afraid of any foreigners coming into our home, it's dangerous times. My name is Robert. Now I realize. You must be frightened. There's no need. No harm will come to you here. You're safe. You attacked us. We defended ourselves. Now if you'd come peacefully, well, things woulda been different. He lied to us, told us he had a friend that needed our help. Well, that's a test. If you were good people, you would have helped, not so? You're sick. I will do anything... to protect my home and my family. And I'm sure you'd do the same. Tell me, your father, is he the man at the river? He's not my dad. Oh. Please... Just let me go. Well, of course. You're free. You can go whenever you like. But it would be nice if you stayed with us and just shared a meal. Have some of our hospitality. Meet the family. Sit round the table. And if I don't wanna stay? Well... Luckily, we have a doctor. If he thinks that you're healthy, well, then, by all means, you can leave. Although, I wish you would stay. You have such beautiful eyes. Innocence. How is it that they've remained so unblemished? Don't touch me! [SNIFFS] Now that... [♪♪♪] That was disrespectful. Not called for. Now why did you come here? Why did you leave your camp? MAN: She's not gonna talk. We can just cut her up and eat her tonight. No. No, no, no. You know the world. What is happening to the world is necessary. For man is evil... greedy, violent. We had to be humbled. And possibly, with that little bit of humility, we can begin again as a family. And that is up to us. And you can help us willingly, or we will have to force you. I'm only trying to help you, child. Tell me, have you ever fallen pregnant? But you can fall pregnant? Am I right? [GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE] What the hell was that? MAN [ON RADIO]: We got some walkers by the fence. Took a shot at them. I'll be upstairs now. You, clean her up and lock her up, and you don't touch her, you hear? Not tonight. Got it. [CHAIR SCRAPES LOUDLY] [SPITS] Yeah. Nice and clean. Nice and clean. Let me get that. I haven't been with a girl in a long time. Look at those lips. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't been with a girl like this in years. Look at those lips. So beautiful. No. No! Open your mouth! [WHIMPERING] Open it, open your mouth. I said open your mouth! Open your mouth. [GASPS] Do that again, and I'll break your neck, you hear me? Do you hear me? Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. That's it, nice and wide. There we go. Heh-heh. There we go. Hm-mm! Hm-mm! [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Keep still. That's it. No! No! You shut the fuck up! What'd I tell you? Hey! What'd I tell you? You shut the fuck up! Open your mouth. Open your mouth. That's it. Here we go. [SCREAMS] It's okay. It's okay. You're safe. He's not gonna hurt you again. It's okay. I thought you were gone. I thought you left me. I wouldn't do that. It's okay. Get your things. We gotta go. Get your things. Come on. [♪♪♪] [GASPING] Rose. Rose. Shh, shh. Be quiet. We have to keep quiet. Rose, we have to keep quiet. [EXCLAIMS] Jesus. We got an escapee. Shut down the fucking camp! I'll see you now, you fucker! Fuck. Rose, get down. [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Rose, come on! [♪♪♪] Go, go, go! [GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE] Rose, come on. Sam! You okay? I'm fine. Rose... You gotta keep going. Okay? No, Sam. Listen to me. Keep going, in that direction. You'll find a shaft, that leads down to the tunnel. All right? ROBERT: You can't get away. We'll hunt you down. They're trying to get around us. Take me. Let the kid go. Oh, there's no chance of that. She's a child, for Christ's sake. Oh, we gotta eat. I mean, you didn't think we were running a charity organization, did ya? I'm giving you a chance to do the right thing. Take me, let her go. I won't fight back. I'll surrender. Oh, I don't mind if you do fight. Makes the meal more rewarding. Rose. On my signal... you run. Okay? And you don't stop. [SOFTLY] Go, Rose. Go. [♪♪♪] Fuck you! Go get the girl. [THUNDER RUMBLING] You're a brave man. I admire that. Fuck you. Get on with it. I'm gonna eat you tonight, and shit you out tomorrow morning. Now look at me. Look at me. [FRENZIED SHRIEKING] Incoming! Give me the rifle! [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] Sam. Sam. Sam? [COUGHING] Sam. Sam. Sam, we can fix this. We can fix you up, okay? Rose. What are you doing here? I told you to keep running. You gotta make your way back to the tunnel, Rose. Rose. Take this. You know how to use it, right? You're gonna make it, Rose. You're strong. Sam. Rose, I can't. Sam? Rose. Rose. I can't. I can't... Sam. No, Sam. I can't... It's okay. [CRYING] It's okay. It's okay. [SHUSHING] [INHALES SHARPLY] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] You okay? You good, right? You're okay. Hey, Sam. Hey, Sam. Sam? Sam? Hey, Sam? Sam? Sam. Hey, Sam. Hey. Hey, buddy. We got the sun on our face, buddy. We got the sun on our face. We got the... [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
