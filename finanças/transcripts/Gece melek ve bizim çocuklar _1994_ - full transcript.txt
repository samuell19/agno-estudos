Coloured Dawn film laboratories YE??L?AM films & ATIF YILMAZ present The Night, Melek and Our Children starring and introducing for the first time on the screen guest players and actors live sound recording sound engineer art director assistant director editing cinematographer scenario producer director Suzan? Girl, I thought I'd die of fright. Are you still turning tricks? I'm waiting for Suzan. They went berserk again tonight. They threw everyone inside. If they also lock up that slut it'll be hard for her. It'll be the second time this week. When Kristin went mad again, I had to take her home. It's a good thing she went mad. Otherwise I too would have spent the night with the cops. Blondie? Come here. My baby ... were you waiting for me? Your mummy could eat you up. I gave him some roast meat, he's not hungry, just moody. Thanks, sis. - I'm dead tired. - Later girl, bye bye. Who the fuck are you? What the fuck are you doing here? - Meral... Meral abla ... - What's happened to Meral? - I'm just waiting for her. - Meral isn't here. Get lost. Listen ... Meral abla said, anytime I'm in trouble ... and I'm broke. I came here once before. You're wasting your time. Meral left for Adana. I'm living here now. Sister, I'm freezing, please let me in. I've been waiting for hours. Don't stand there. Don't you have a place of your own? I was staying with another girl. They took her in tonight. I was afraid to go back to her place. - You can't stay here. - Just for one night. All right. You can sleep over there. I'll bring you a blanket, it gets cold at night. - Thank you, sister, I won't be cold. - Don't call me sister. What the fuck do you mean by "sister, sister"? Here you are. Thank you, sis ... - Where are you from? - ?anakkale. - New here? - I arrived some months ago. What did you come here for anyway? Never mind, girl, you'll find your way. Questioning you at this hour ... As if we're doing a talk show. I'm going to bed now. # Ah, there's a mirror in the police station # Girl, you got a stamp mark on your arm Blondie too has been out whoring tonight. Grocer, one packet of cigarettes, 10 eggs! That son of a bitch! Would it make any difference if I had asked his name? As if he'd say "I'm Abdurrahman". He'd call himself Filiz, or Noyan. Fuck him! He'd have invented some name anyway. As the saying goes "pity's outcome is misfortune". Why did you take in the slut anyway, since you didn't know him? I don't know. Since he knew Meral ... He looked like such a rookie. Now I know what a bastard he really is. - Are you satisfied, Miss Noyan? - It's fine. I'm fed up with it all anyway. I'm determined to catch him. - I just wanted to help, girl. - So what. I just wanted to help. What's the problem? - What's up? - I'm fine. Give me a soda with lemon. I've a splitting headache. Girl, drink some fake ones. I will, and make you earn five times as much. Two gin tonic, one of them fake, is that it? Girl, we all have to survive somehow. Otherwise you'll get fucked. Don't worry, Osman Abi. - Who's that reddish jackal on the dance floor? - Hakan... He's flat broke but a well-mannered guy. He comes here from time to time. - Since when can a flat broke guy be well-mannered? - I swear, he's a prince. The other night one of the guys got drunk and molested the girls. He probably insulted the kid too. Osman Abi also saw it. He just grabbed the guy and kicked him out. I see, another bulldog! What's up, Nebahat Abla? Always the same. They're staying inside for hours. You'd think they're having their abortions in here. Hurry up, girl. Or I'll explode. - Feeling better now? - Uhu. This is for you. Sonny, do you think this is a public toilet? What's that money? Nebahat Abla, take it for once. Run along. What a faggot! How could it happen? What do I know? But one day I'm going to catch him. Go to the police. - What! You must have good relations with the police. - I don't. It's just that ... What will you have? Whiskey. And none of that fake stuff. - You? - Nothing for me. The same for the gentleman. You're broke, right? I helped out a friend tonight, gave him all I had with me. I'm sorry. Let's finish our drinks and get out. You'll see, we'll find that bastard too. The son of a bitch isn't here. Can I have a light, darling? There he is, the faggot. I'll kill you, bastard. Faggot! - Give me the money, bastard. - Wait, one moment ... - One moment ... - Give it to me! I'll kill you. All right. This is all I have. Don't interfere, man. The cops! The cops! The cops! Let's get away. Count it 200 mark are missing, at most. I'm telling you ... You dirty faggot! Ungrateful dog! Believe me, I was forced to steal it. And I was going to earn money and pay you back. How could you ever earn money, you piece of trash! I was hungry. I hadn't even clothes left to wear. - What was your name again? - Arif. Arif... That's likely. - I can show you my ID. - All right, never mind. - I wish we'd taken Hakan with us. - The kid who hit me? Yes. Where shall we go? I know a good place. Tonight you're my guest. - Is it far from here? - Right around the corner. - Girl, how you've changed, I hardly recognized you. - Thank you, sister. - Who's that lady? - A friend from Ankara. One of the first who's had her dick cut off. You don't fool me, bitch. As if we couldn't spot a natural broad. Give me a break, sister. She's no stranger, so be cool about it. Look, he's found us. Don't worry, he won't cause trouble. He's just tired of acting the macho for me. Hakan! We've had too many drinks last night. I'm still having a hang-over. - That cat is hungry. - I'm starved too. Let's order something from downstairs. What will you have? Some vegetable dish. This is 16/5. What have you got? Forget about kebap, what pot dishes have you got? Ok, two portions. And d?ner. And some yoghurt. Ok. The d?ner meat is for Blondie. Come here, my baby. Let me cuddle you. Girl, let me put some make-up on your face. And you can wear some of my clothes. We're the same size. For real, sister? You've got a beautiful face. Once we've touched up those eyes ... Let's first pick up some clothes. - That red piece is fabulous. - That won't suit you. It's cut too low in front. Try on this one. Oh mama, but you got no tits at all! I'll be getting hormone shots soon. Let me get you a bra. We'll stuff it with cotton. Thank you very much, pretty woman. Now you must be sexy and pull plenty of tricks, girl. I'm trying to collect some dough. I swear I will, sister. I say! There ain't a trick that'll resist me now! Don't panic, that's the lunch we've ordered. ...Nil?fer sings: "I swore I'd never go back". Listener requests from K?z?ltoprak: Ayd?n Talat and G?ner Tosun. from Aksaray: ?afak D?zg?n, Zerrin Adal?er, Nuran Sezgin... ...Ahmet Osman and Y?lmaz ?zdemir... from Levent: Hamdi Posb?y?k, H?d?r ?zdemir... You're still here, dude? Man, you're still at the spot where I left you 3 hours ago. You're weird today. What's the matter? Tell me. - It's nothing. Just sitting. - Don't try to fool me. - Come on, let's have a beer. - I don't feel like it. - And you haven't been at Bitirim's for days. - I owe him some money. - How much? - Forget it. # I swore I won't go back. # in melancholy tunnels my life faded away... # may my tongue burn in hell I see. You've been on the look-out. Don't hit me brother. Have mercy, brother. Let's go. I'll invite you to a tea. Man, you must have drunk 50 glasses by now. Look here! Get in, my rose. We'll go for a ride. Get going. Wait a second! Why don't you like us? Our money's as good as anybody's. Get lost, or you'll never stop your car here again. Drive on, man. Madam. Would you like to step inside? - Where are we going? - How beautiful you are. Look out! I charge 500.000. Have some cognac. It'll warm you up. - I said, I charge 500.000. - Come on, have a drink, it'll warm you. Are you crazy? What a maniac! Where are we going? Don't drink anymore. You're very drunk. Why, sweetheart! Did I pick you up again from the side of the road? Careful! That was close! - Stop the car, I'll get off. - No you won't. - We're going to have a lot of fun yet. - This isn't my idea of fun. Come on, finish it. Stop the car, I'm telling you! Stop the car, or you'll regret it. So that's what you're like! I adore women like that. - Stop the car, or I'll stab you. - ok, ok. Welcome. - Come on. - Where are we? Come on. - Look here, first we make the deal. - All right, come with me. Divan Hotel Come. Why is it locked? Is nobody here? Or did you all run away when you saw me? Oh my God! Surprise! # Happy birthday to you. Where have you been, you ... But you were supposed to stay home tonight, you naughty boy. - But I am home. I swear I am. - Come along, let's see if your breath is up to it. Come with me, help me out. Are we ready? We are. 1 ... 2 ... 3 Bravo! Bravo! Thank you ... thank you - Hallo. How are you? - Fine. Thank you. - Remzi is such a crazy guy, isn't he. - But the girl's stunning. - What would you like to drink, madam? - I'll have a whisky. Here you are, madam. Merci. Aylin, aren't you going to introduce me to the lady? She's marvelous, but I don't even know her name. Serap... I'm Serap. Did you know that today's Remzi's birthday? No, I ... I've arranged a surprise party for him. I know he drops in here every night.. But the real surprise came from him. Won't you introduce me to your friend? Serap, wasn't it? Her name's Serap. Serap... Anyway, I'm Remzi. Pleased to meet you. What's your problem, man! Impossible, really! Remzi just left, darling. Didn't he tell you? He's such a crazy guy, you must forgive him. - All right. - What? Didn't I pick you up from here? Come on. I'm dead tired. I'm off to bed. I'm sorry. - Selim! - Where have you been, man? Never mind. Swipe me a rak?. It's hard at the moment. They placed a guy next to me who checks on everything. - Ok, forget it. - Wait a second. Drink it quickly, so they won't put it on the bill. Thanks. Is Mehmet no longer around? Why? You're in need of cash again? From Ertan Bey. - Who's he? - That bearded old geezer over there. I must see Mehmet Bey. - Call him at his home no. - He doesn't answer. Maybe his home line is cut off cause he didn't pay the bill. Fuck off! - Good evening. How are you doing? - Like shit! You see! Just stay close to your sister. You've got all the works. You're brilliant. - Just use your brains a bit. - But the guy was disgusting! What did you expect, slut? Anthony Delon would never have paid that much, wouldn't he? I'm going in here now. Won't you join me? No thanks, sister. I'll go to Maji's. - Bye bye. Many thanks. - Bye, darling. - Osman! - Get out! - Come out! - Get lost! Come out, you son of a bitch. - May God curse you! - I'm burning, man, burning for you. - Fuck off! - Osman! Osman! Burning for you all the time. I'd rather you finished me off! Don't turn me over to those faggots. Osman! What's going on? Let go of me! Let go of me. Let me kill that piece of shit! Otherwise she'll never leave me in peace. Let go of me, I'm telling you! Slut! If you ever allow that slut in here again ... Come on, get lost, don't stay here. What kind of a woman are you anyway! First you stab the guy, then you keep hanging around his door. Run along. I was going to call the police, but God has punished you anyway. Sister? Are you all right? Look here! Get that broad away from here, or I'll raise hell. Run along, sister. Are you hungry? We'll have a nice hot soup. It'll do you good. - We're closed. - You don't say! Open up, then! I said we're closed. Run along. Take this, now open up. And if you keep on being snotty you won't have a single window left unsmashed by morning. Make it snappy! What will you have, sister? Two tripe soup. And some yoghurt. Tell me what's wrong, sister. I can't eat a thing. If we had something to drink ... Not on an empty stomach. Have a bite first. What a kid you are. Do you know Osman? He used to be my calamity. And now, I'm his calamity. Why? Oh, little one. It hurts so much. It's tearing my flesh apart. During my two years in jail I thought of him all the time. - You served time? - I got released yesterday. - May it be over now. - It's never over, little one. And it isn't likely that I'll get over it soon. Why did they turn you in, sister? I stabbed a man. - I stabbed Osman. - Why did you do it? Because I loved him, little one. Because I loved him. - Do you have a place to stay? - Never mind. Thank you. This cognac has warmed my insides. - I hope you won't get into trouble? - Don't worry, Melek Abla. Serap is an angel. Let's be quiet, Serap's home. She's on the job with a trick. - Hadn't we better go out again? - No need, the trick will leave soon. Serap never lets a trick stay overnight. Blondie. My poor girl. All alone. That's all I'm going to pay, girl. What was that, man? Didn't we have a deal? I said, only so much. Take it or leave it. If you were a man, you'd keep your word. Shut up. You're giving me a headache. Even if I didn't give you five pence, there's nothing you could you do about it, you slut! What kind of creep are you? And I took you for a real man. Fuck yourself. Dirty whore. This is all I'm going to pay, get it? You bastard! I'll make you pay ... - You asshole. Son of a bitch. - Fuck yourself! Look at me, you son of a bitch. Pay that girl's money. Fork it out! This won't be the first time I'm stabbing a guy. Did you imagine the girl had no protectors? Come on! - Girl, how much was your deal with that faggot? - 400.000. Of course now it'll be 500.000. Fork it out, man! Or did you go out whoring with no money in your pocket? Wait ... all right, all right. May God curse ... Now the asshole's invoking God! Fork it out! Take it. May it be cursed. As if your shitty money could ever be blessed. But we'll find a way to bless it. And now you fuck off. Our Apo will be here soon. He's not as soft as we are. He'll cut you up like a butcher. That's the story. As if an evil spirit had entered me. I'm no longer myself. Was it worth all the trouble, sister? For the love of God? How can you resist your heart's desire? He was the love of my life. I loved him to death. He used to rent me out. He didn't even let me sniff one penny. He beat me up. And not one sweet word from him, ever. Forget about that pimp. But on some nights ... On some nights he got really frightened. He looked as if he saw a ghost. He clung to me real tight, as if he was afraid of falling. And he wept. Like a little boy. "What's the matter, my Osman?" I said. "Tell me your trouble." He didn't say a word. He just clung to me like that. My arms felt numb after a while. I stroke his face for hours. Gently, gently... Sometimes I sang him a lullaby. He relaxed and fell asleep. I guess I loved him for this. Stay a while with us. Get some rest. No thanks. Your place is small enough already. Tomorrow I'll go to Sebahat. I'll stay with her a few days. I'll look for work. Or maybe she'll find work for me. Her son-in-law works in a factory. Who is Sebahat? Do we know her? No. We were together in jail. We were very close. She got released two months ago. - You won't be comfortable with her, sister. - I will. Sebahat is a darling. And I'll stop drinking. I'll get a grip on myself. I'm going to bed now, ladies. I'm exhausted. You're in charge, Arif. Come here, Blondie, come to mummy. Hakan! Hallo. What's up? - Don't put on an act, man! - Who's putting on an act? You don't fool me, sonny. You've been sitting in the coffeehouse since morning. - You're stalking me. Right? - Come on! Who do you think you are? Let's not bother about who I think I am. Am I lying? Tell me. You're lying. I'm always hanging out in this coffeehouse. - Really? Very well. See you. - Wait. Don't run off. Look who's stalking again. I'm stalking you, ok? What about you? Why do you always ignore me? - What's the matter? - I feel faint. Your hands are hot. You're feverish. Mummy ... mummy ... My beautiful daughter. I'm here. Mummy, water ... water My poor darling. You've caught a bad cold. Real bad. But it'll be gone by tomorrow. This is one of my favourite pieces. - Are you angry with me? - I'm just sad, - because you didn't call me. - I called. But you didn't answer the phone. You know ... I've fallen in love. - I guessed as much. - A young girl I met in a nightclub. Hakan... Hakan... I'm glad. Why? A man must fall in love so that he can fully know himself, feel love for himself. - But it's impossible. - What love affair isn't impossible? I feel so afraid. So much, so much. Melek Abla... - You're back, darling? - How is she? Her fever's gone down a bit. She'll be all right by tomorrow. - You go to bed now. - No way. She might wake up and need something. - How was business? - Slack. - It'll improve. You go to bed now. - You go to bed. I'll keep watch a bit. No way. You're tired. And I've been sitting here all day. - You're not leaving tomorrow, won't you? - It depends on Serap. Once she's well I'll leave. - Good night. - Good night. I get confused about what day it is? So I've slept for two days? - You should stay in bed for another day. You might relapse. - Give me a break, I'm feeling bored. And I feel fine. Don't worry. Melek Abla, you look "sugar". Really? I swear. You need some colour. Brighten up your face a bit. No darling, I won't put on make-up. Maybe a bit of rouge. Why, nobody'll notice that you're wearing make-up. You leave it to me. - I wish you wouldn't leave. - But I'll visit you. How can I ever pay you back? Shut up, girl. Or you'll make me cry and ruin my make-up. And don't forget to take your medicine. Don't catch cold again. - I promise. - That's enough. I'm also leaving, ain't I? Look at the jealous queen. The Rose of ?anakkale! - You're from ?anakkale? - Yes. Alas. - Why alas? - Please! They made me suffer a lot down there. Such a small place. Everybody watching each other. Did you walk around as Fulya over there too, girl? As if I ever! Over there I posed as a womanizing macho! - No way! - I swear! I used to be like that. But then I thought I'd go crazy. One day in the market place I started screaming my head off. - Why did you scream? - "I'm a woman! None of your business!" so that they got the message. - Finally they approached me. - What did they say? What could they say? First they beat me up, then they dragged me to the hospital. You know, I could have lived my life down there without anybody finding me out. They're totally blind to such things. When I was a kid, we had such queens in our neighbourhood. They were obvious. What did they say about them: "He once loved a girl, they weren't allowed to marry, then he got depressed and never married." Well, I must go now. We'll see you off. Don't bother. I'm not leaving for ?anakkale, you know. God forbid! Come and see us soon. Farewell, my dear sister. You two take care. - Look, there's Hakan. - He's always around anyway. Are you well again? Bye bye, see you tonight. How churlish you are! That girl never did you any harm. I don't like faggots, ok? And I don't kiss them on the street. - You're such a prick! - Drop it. Get dressed, we'll take a walk. Sebahat! Melek? My darling. Let's go in, it's freezing. - What a sweet little girl. Your granddaughter? - My granddaughter. I'm so excited, I forgot to introduce you. ?yk?. ?yk?, come here, my girl, give Auntie Melek a kiss. You remember how I left for a long voyage? That's when I visited Auntie Melek. Were you in jail too? Also one of the politicals? Look at the precocious girl. Run along. You can play a bit in there. And isn't it your bedtime now? Why, I never saw such a child before! Don't ask me! Her father tells her everything. He says she should know nothing but the truth. I swear, I'm even forbidden to tell her fairy tales. How can one not tell fairy tales to a child? By God, I don't understand it, Melek. Ah, darling. I'll make you some fresh tea. - Was it easy to find us? - I had to ask around. Those silly films always make me cry. I always break down. - But it was a sad story. - Did it make you cry too? No, I don't cry easily. Hakan... what's your job? I've no job at the moment. I gamble a bit, hang around ... What a hobo. - From time to time a job turns up. - What kind of job might that be? Girl, stop questioning me. I am what I am. You tell me: what work could I do? Let's leave. - Why the hurry? - I'm feeling bored. - With me? - Not at all. Why should you bore me? Let's leave, we'll pay on our way out. - Serap... let's to the Bosphorus. - There's nothing to do there. Let's go window shopping. - What are you staring at, you oaf. - The oaf is your father, you pimp. Whom did you call pimp? Taxi! - Thank you for the meal, mother. It's tasty. - It really is. - Enjoy your meal. - Daughter, finish your dinner. - I'm full. - Did your grandmother buy you again some waffles? - I swear I didn't buy her anything. - She just has no appetite these days. - Whatever she sees on TV she craves. # Mummy's chores are made easy ?yk?, finish your dinner. Don't insist, daughter. Otherwise she won't eat out of stubbornness. - You've been spoiling the child too much, mother. - The child is very sweet, my compliments. Sebahat was always talking about her. She's the apple of her eye, ?yk?. And about you all as well, of course. Anyway, in there there's nothing to do but chat, share our grief. - We had plenty of time. - Mother has been telling us about you too, you know. - Where are you staying now? - Near Taksim square. You don't intend to return to your old life I suppose? Forgive me, I speak frankly. I know what people are capable of when they're in a tight spot and see no way out. This state of affairs is oppressing us all. But only the uneducated chose the easy way. Ali, couldn't we find work for Melek Abla? Let's try at the factory, maybe there's work for her there. Sure, we'll ask. But first her mind must be settled in the right place. In order to regain one's honour, one must be pure at heart. # Mother's chores are made easy ?yk?, stop it. Melek Abla, you misunderstand him. He's speaking frankly because he likes you. Not at all. I too like to speak frankly, sonny. It's getting late. Allow me. My friends might worry about me. - I wish you could stay, Melek. - I'm sorry. And I have a long way back. I hope we haven't hurt you. One must always be able to offer personal criticism, and at all times. Certainly, my son. You go inside now. The house mustn't get cold. What beautiful days we had ... - Why did you run away? - What else could I have done? Did you want me to spend the night with you at the police station? - Why must you provoke fights? - But the guy stared at you like an oaf. Sonny, it's my job to deal with oafs. Are you alone? Come in. Take it, you're soaked. - Serap... - You want a tea? Serap! What? I love you. You want some tea? Do you have anything to drink? Let me see, I think we have some cognac. Bless you. You've caught a cold. Take off your clothes. - It's nothing. - Are you crazy. Look at you! - You're wet underneath too. - I'll open it. Don't pull. Ok. You'll tear it. Don't ... don't ... Don't! You're tickling me. - Very well. - Don't! Do I make you feel ashamed? Come on, buy some boza* [*fermented millet drink] Don't you smoke? No. I just thought, since people always smoke after lovemaking ... - I wanted to try it too. - Your first attempt? Will you go out tonight? Give me a break, at such an hour business is always rotten. Fulya... - Melek Abla! What are you doing around here? - Never mind. - Please help me out. - Didn't you join your friend? - Where's your suitcase? - Fuck the suitcase. Some shit took it and ran away with it. - Fulya! I'm off. All right, see you. Come here. - Have a swig. - No thanks. And you've had enough. Listen. Go and find Osman. Tell him "Melek it dying. Her last breath. She's delirious, calling for you." - Go and bring him here. - Melek Abla... Be silent. Tell him "Please! It's her last wish." Even a convict sentenced to death may have a last wish. Tell him I'm dying. Please, darling. Do me this favour, please. His doormen keep guard again. They won't let me come near him. - Please go and bring him here. - Melek Abla... he'd never come. Please let's go home. Lie down, take some rest. Don't you see? I'm dying. But my dear sister ... All right, I'll go. You wait for me here. Don't leave. - We don't allow your kind in here anymore. Get lost. - Since when? That's the way it is. You're ruining the girls' business. Run along. I'm not looking for tricks in here anyway. I've come to see Osman Abi. - What do you want from Osman Bey? - None of your business! It's very important. I absolutely must see him. Wait here. I'll tell him. Son of a bitch. - Who is it? - The one waiting over there. - You wanted to see me? - Yes, Osman Abi. Don't you remember me? I used to come here all the time. Girl, I don't remember everybody who comes here. If you're trying to get in again, you're wasting your time. We no longer allow trannies or drag queens in here. This is not why I came. Osman Abi, Melek Abla sent me here. Fuck off, buddy! And tell that slut if she ever crosses my path again, I'll cut her to pieces. And don't you dare show yourself in here again. Kick that faggot out. Next time, open your fucking eyes! Fuck off! And don't ever come back here. Those types are a pain in the ass. - Have you seen Melek Abla? - Sorry. - Let's go. - Come on. Let's go. Get in. Get in. - And shut up! - Let go of me. The guy was puzzled, ok? He didn't see us. And when I suddenly appeared before him, he put up his hands and shouted "I surrender". I'm hungry. - Would you like some baked potatoes. - Sure. Look here. Two baked potatoes. BAKED POTATOES Hey! Are you crazy? What's the matter with you? Did you think I was going to jump? What if you slipped? Do you know what I did as a child? I climbed on the rooftop. And I sat right next to the edge. I took a deep breath, I kept my eyes tight shut. I even swung my body a bit sometimes. That was my favourite game. Were you never afraid? I was terribly afraid. But at the same time, I felt thrilled. You're crazy. There was a meadow too. And each spring a travelling circus struck a tent there. There was a rope dancer, he wore a clown's costume. His name was Boncuk. [round marble] He was my first love. How do you mean? Not like that! He knew nothing about it. I was just a tiny little rascal. - You should have seen how I cried when they put up their tent and left. - Come on! Boncuk... Boncuk... - Boncuk! Boncuk! - Shut up! He's MY Boncuk. Serap... Let's get married. Have you gone raving mad? On what can we get married? So what. I'll work. Everybody's getting married somehow. I entered this life because I didn't want to get married like everybody else, sonny. What are we going to do? Look here, we're together, that's all. Try to be cool about it. The other night a guy picked me up from the street. He had such a weird black car. - He was really stoned. - Eh? He was young. Handsome too. He took me to a place. Full of rich society people, ladies, gentlemen ... A bit like a restaurant. I never saw such a place in my life. Everybody talking posh "?i?i, fufu, ?i?u..." Let me write it down here. If I never manage to celebrate my birthday in such a place, my name ain't Serap. What's your sign? Fellow country woman, got a light? Let's have it. - Have they kicked you out? - Get lost! Come on! Do some business. Let's have a swig of you, to warm us up. Fuck off, guys. Fuck off. - Come over here. - No, please! Listen to the whore, how she's boiling up. - Lie down here. - No, please! - You keep watch at the corner. - All right. - Hold her arms. - All right. She's screaming like mad. - Why are you shivering? - I don't know, I suddenly felt uneasy. - Let me tell you a story. - Let's go home. - At this hour? - Tonight I'm not working. - The night-watchman's here. - Let's run. Hey! Doing business? Did I interrupt something? Shut up, woman. Dumb broad. Come with me. We're going to the police station. Come with me. What did they do to you? Attack you? Come on. I won't harm you. Come with me. What happened to you? You got arrested? Don't be sad, darling. The roots are still there. It'll grow again. It was bound to happen. I always had nightmares about it. My hair kept growing longer, and I had nightmares about loss of hair. It was bound to happen. There isn't a hospital left I haven't been sent to. One of the girls cut herself up with a razor, her arms, her breasts. Here eyes were like crazy. And she started screaming. They gave up and didn't take her. Another one cried and begged them not to cut off her hair. I stayed cool. "Cut it all, darlings" I said. "And take a bit more off down here." As if they could turn me into a man if they cut my hair. Why, I might wear a headscarf, and then what? New panic and admonitions at the police station "Look here, my son, go home, or you'll come to a bad end, whatever" "What son?", I said. "You're to call me daughter, daughter!" Then he slapped my face. "We'll inform your family", they said. "Inform them" I said. "Let everybody know." As if my people hadn't made be suffer enough. Then they opened a file for my case. To hell with it! A real mess, you know. We had fun till morning with the girls. Pop songs, t?rk?s, dancing ... You never saw such merriment. So what! Your hair'll grow again. And short hair is the fashion these days. Since you're a woman in your soul ... What happened, man? You look like a plucked chicken? Drafted into the army? Shut up, you oaf. Laugh at your own arsehole! - What's wrong? I'm no longer allowed to make a joke? - Your jokes stink. But look at the state he's in. Never mind, Serap. Your lover has coarse manners. Girl, do you have a long scarf? I'm going to wear a turban, latest fashion. And one end of the scarf swinging down to the floor, that's how I'll be strutting along. Let me check, I think I've got one. You see, lover boy. I'm that kind of a woman. I'm no longer afraid of anything. I just want to have fun. - Look what I found. - My cut-off hair! Allow me to present: Fulya the Sultan! # you're trapped, oh yeah, you're trapped you underestimate too much # I kept silent, I swallowed it all, you thought I swallowed it all # # you're trapped, oh yeah, you fell into error, for good Hallo? The police station. Hello. Yes, I know her. Sure. I'm on my way. - Those fuckers. - What happened? Melek... Melek Abla... Beyo?lu County Police Station You wait for me here. - They called me from the police station. My aunt is here. - Ask inside. - Thank you. 77/2, roger - You came to pick her up? - Yes, Inspector. What happened? - She was attacked. - By whom? She doesn't talk. They raped her. We can't even take her statement. - It happened at night. In one of those abandoned alleys. - May I take her with me? Please sign here. - And those bastards? Will they get away with it? - There's nothing we can do. When she's better she must give her statement. Let's go, Melek Abla. Let's go. Did they hurt you much, my beauty? I'll make them pay for it, you'll see. They won't get away with it. Try to sleep a bit. Relax. You know, Melek Abla, I think I've fallen in love. With that dog. I don't know if you remember him. Hakan. He's a total loser, but I'm mad about him. And he isn't even fair-skinned. I've never wanted to attach myself to a guy. But it's hard to be alone all the time. The kid's brave. A bit crazy. I think if he protects me I'll do better business. I'll buy him some pretty clothes. He looks like a film star anyway. And if you knew how much he loves me ... You'll get well too. We'll move into a beautiful house, you'll join us. I don't know how we all are going to end. - What's the news, man? - I'm fine, Osman Abi. - No problems? - None, abi. - Don't let go of that girl. She's a rose. You won't find many like her. - Very well. But she's a bit stubborn. Stuck-up nose. Give her a light beating from time to time. Then she'll be as mellow as wax. See that john over there? Talking to the girl. He's mighty generous. Has loads of money. What's wrong, man? We're talking business. No need to feel uncomfortable. You'll get used to it. - Another one. - Take it easy, son. The night's still young. - Shut up, man! Give me another. - What a foul mood you're in, son. Have one, but don't blame me. Whatever her price I'll pay, my ram. I've always paid my debts till now. Very well, pay up now. - Brother, not in here! Let's go out. - Drop that brotherly tone. - Your friend is getting a bit upset. - Shut up, man! - You were giving her the look-over. Or don't you have the guts? - Careful, pimp! Don't get angry, darling. He's a youngster, doesn't know the business yet. - No harm done. It's all my fault. - As if he knew it all? Run along, we're leaving. Forgive me, we've spoilt your mood. I shit on his mood. - Listen to me, pimp! - Careful how you talk to me. What did you spoil my business for, you dumb oaf. Didn't we have a deal? I didn't like the guy, ok? Let go of my collar. What do you mean "I didn't like the guy." Are you the one who has to let him screw you? You've provoked the fight on purpose. So that I won't do business. Is this how you're going to look after me? Answer me, you loser. - Careful how you talk to me, you slut! - The slut is your mother. - I'll make you pay for it, you son of a bitch. - Go and fuck yourself. - You'll get over it, sugar. - Fuck off, you slut. May God curse him. Listen. I won't have such incidents in my club. - Ok? - Ok. This place is getting on my nerves. Let's get out. Let me pay the bill. Waiter. - Sir? - Check please. Squeeze your hand. Make a fist. - It hurts. - Of course it hurts. But you can squeeze. So it's nothing serious. - What is that faggot doing here? - Take it easy, Serap. Listen ... - Your lover has something to say to you. - Fuck off. Don't, sister. Have a seat and give your nerves a break. Fulya, don't interfere. I told you to fuck off. Get lost. But he hit me, sister. He hit me. I won't let anybody hit me. But he'll full of remorse. He's punished himself because he hit you. He beat his fists against the wall. Look at his hand. Give me a break! I know how precious you are. Forgive me. I was mad with jealousy. I didn't know what I was doing. I don't want you do that kind of work. - What other job can I do? - I love you so much. But I can't stand it! You've struck against the wall? Because you've hit me? In that case, we're even. My darling. I won't let you work. I'll earn good money. We'll go away. I won't let you work. I'll earn good money. They're silent now. They've made up. Huh, sister? What's the hurry? Let's sit down and have fun. - I want to catch the broad before she leaves home. - I'll make some tea. I've already made tea. I feel like a guest. I shall miss you, girl. Please! All those places are the same. And if I don't get on with those bitches, I'll just pack my bag and come back. - How're things with lover boy? - What do I know? You're in love, girl. - But I don't know how to make it work. - You'll find a way. He doesn't want me to work, he's going to earn himself. Don't laugh. He's a lion. Why shouldn't he make money? - What a pretty colour. - Isn't it? I haven't been knitting for ages. But I haven't forgotten. Are you well, Melek Abla? I'm worried, you know. - You won't stay away long, won't you? - No darling, a week at most. Melahat's babysitter went back to her village. And her daughter needs someone to look after the child. So she won't be worried about the girl. Fulya left. You'll be leaving too. And I'll be all alone soon. "A well-paid job came up. I won't be back tonight. Don't worry." "See you in the morning, darling." Serap. Who is it. It's me, Mehmet. Hakan, won't you open the door? Hakan, please. Hakan! I've been following you. I was afraid you'd do something bad. Hakan... I was never angry with you. Believe me, I was only afraid. And I would never have come here if you weren't in such distress. I know you. - It's all here. - Keep it. But I want the chain. That's a keepsake from my wife. You're in trouble? With your girl? I brought you some money. So that you won't do anything foolish. Hakan, I love you. Please forgive me. Hakan! Serap... Serap! - Serap... - Don't touch me. I told you I wouldn't be home tonight. So you profited, didn't you? Or do you always bring your men here? What was wrong with Fulya? With Arif? Tell me! You son of a bitch. Tell me! In fact, you're more of a whore than I am. Is this what you charge? I'm very sorry. Get lost. And take your husband with you. Get lost, you dirty faggot. I'm very sorry. Take it. You'll pay him downstairs. Listen. He loves you very much. The both of us? Go now. I'll earn lots of money .... lots of money... And lots more ... lots more ... Lots of money ... lots more ... Lots of money ... lots more ... See you. Help! Help! Don't. Help! - Let's go! - Come along! Hakan! May it be over and forgotten. - What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. - I'll treat you to a beer, lover boy. - Drop that lover boy talk. Come on. Two beer. Have you seen Serap? What did she tell you? - Serap left. - Where to? To Adana. She was going to be a singer. Meral found her a job. She kept nagging anyway. "It's impossible to live here" she said and left. Who's Meral? They used to share a flat. She went to Adana. - When will she be back? Do you know her address? - "Once I'm settled down I'll write", she said. - Won't she come back? - Sure ... she'll come back eventually. Why, nobody stays in Adana forever. Can I have another beer? - Selin! Come on. - One second, darling. - Bye bye. - See you. - Hello. Shall we get in? - Jump in. We will, darling. - Get out. The cops. - What? You drive on, we'll join you in 5 minutes. - Fulya, they were fine. - Run along, they'll find us later. - Sister, the cops are over there. - Come here. At this hour there's a red Renault driving around. Don't get in, the guy's a maniac. I know, the baldhead. He's really a maniac. He picks you up in his car, then he starts insulting you. He pulled a knife on me. "Take it out, let me see it, I'll cut it off." "Cut off your own tool" I'd have told him. "I've had mine cut off long ago." Let's split up, sister. Otherwise no John will bite. - No way, mama! I won't take this! - Shut up! Stop the car over there. I'm not your chauffeur, slut! I stop the car where I want. Let's roll. What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? Dirty pimps! Serves them right. - What's up? - Hallo. Where have you been? It's been 3 months. Mehmet is always asking about you. I heard you were in jail. But you got off lightly. - Give me a whisky. - Don't give me that look. You've been away for so long. And now not one word. Hakan... Why are you running away from me? I was very worried about you. Are you well? Let's go somewhere quiet where we can talk. Hakan... Come on, you've been sitting here long enough. - Has she come? - Who? - My daughter was going to come and take me home. - Nobody came. Get going. Good gracious, look at the state you're in. Don't come back here. And you've no money anyway. Don't ever come back here. Fulya! Why, where've you been? I never see you nowadays. - I'm working in this place. - So you've finally found a job, lover boy. Drop that tone. Listen, are you in contact with Melek? What's the matter with Melek Abla? You look a bit after that broad, girl. Otherwise she'll end badly. - The Melek from our nightclub? - Yes. Has something happened? The other night she turned up again here, a bottle in her hand, shouting "Osman, Osman". She's gone raving mad, the dirty broad. What can I do, Hakan? Melek Abla has gone real bad. Ever since Serap left, she couldn't get a grip on herself. It's up to you. I've had a hard time holding Osman abi back. He feels pity for her. He gave me some money for her so that she wouldn't come here again. But the broad is totally off her rocker. I give her the money, she tears it to shreds. Didn't she recognize you? How do I know? She probably did. But she was screaming her head off. - Hakan, Osman Abi wants you. - I'm coming. So long. I'll talk to her. - Fulya! - Yes? Got any news for me? She's sending her greetings to you too. Give Fulya a kiss from me, she says. I'll come back soon, she says. She's writing that she'll take me away from here. That we'll all move into a beautiful home. It's enough now, Melek Abla! I swear. She says she'll be here in a week. - She writes that it's very hot in Adana. - Melek Abla, don't... Drop those fairy tales about a letter. It's been a year now and you still go on about it. Serap has come back here long ago. But she doesn't call us. Forget about her. Don't wait for her anymore. But you're wrong! She's been writing me letters. Daily. Ever since she left. I've got a whole bundle of her letters. She doesn't write letters. Melek Abla, you're inventing things. And where could she send the letters to? Stop fooling yourself. And don't drink so much. - Big sister, got any letter from your daughter? - Sure I have. She'll come and visit me soon. Congratulations. Melek Abla... The other night you were again disgracefully drunk. Listen, you might even get thrown out of this place. They'll tell you that they won't help you any longer. Please ... # Tell me, lover, will you come with me? Look at the old broad! Any trouble? Osman! I'm burning up. Don't deliver me to those faggots. Let go of her! I've loved only you, Osman... Only you... I'd die for you, Osman. Only you ... only you, Osma-- Drop dead! - The slut! That's what she wanted! - You get lost now! Disperse, everyone. You all saw nothing. Disperse, everyone. You all saw nothing. My dear abla.... Melek abla. Serap? You? You've come ... at last ... My dear abla ... It was her, wasn't it? Come away. Surprise! Happy birthday to you.
