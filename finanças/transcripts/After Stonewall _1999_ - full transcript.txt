Speech! Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost-victory? Uh, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys. Yeah! And it's okay to be gay. What? Being gay is just part of being nature and a beautiful thing. What the hell is he talking about? ♪♪ (man) Uh, the night of the Stonewall riots came along. Just everything came together, that one moment. If you were there, you just knew, this is it. This is what we've been waiting for. (all) Say it proud, say it loud! ♪♪ (Melissa) Everything changed after Stonewall. It led us to a time when millions of homosexuals around the world would no longer hide their identity. It also marked the beginning of a seismic shift in society at large. How did this happen? How did a new openness among gay people transform virtually every area of life? And it's okay to be gay. This is the subject of After Stonewall. (man) When Stonewall happened, I was in New Jersey. (woman) No, I was the only lesbian in New York who was not involved in the Stonewall riots. (woman) Native Americans took over Alcatraz and that to me was the thing I remembered most about that year. (woman) I'm not even sure that I knew it had occurred. Probably not. I was in Cleveland. (man) When I was younger, I would always dream of being a police officer. When I decided to go through with it, I knew no one could know my secret. And um, that's just the way it was. (man) Some friends said, &quot;You know, you could probably get like, a state legislator,&quot; and I said, &quot;Okay.&quot; But I do remember this decision that I made which is okay, this really means staying in the closet because in 1972, it was inconceivable to me that you could win office and be out. (man) When I first came out in Melbourne, Australia, in 1969, age 17, homosexuality was still totally illegal and it could be punished with several years' imprisonment and even enforced psychiatric treatment. (woman) I led what I called my double life. During the week, I was working for the police department as a social worker and then I would literally disappear on Fridays and head over to New York and do the bars. (woman) All I had was the Baptist church, the vision of what happened to queers in this society and I figured it would kill me. And I'd been working it, looking for ways to die without actively suiciding... passive suicide, the solution of the working class, liquor and fast cars and brutal women. (woman) Most people when I talk to them about events in the early history of our movement are amazed that conditions were like that. Say it proud! (man) I can't hear you! Say it loud! (woman) In the wake of the Stonewall riots and the sudden invasion of people into our movement, a good invasion, a number of organizations starting in New York and spreading to other cities called Gay Liberation Front were established. (man) When Stonewall happened, it just seemed a logical progression from leftist radial politics and then I joined Gay Liberation Front right away after Stonewall. We were a front like the Vietnamese Liberation Front from whom we got our name. (woman) Why are you here today? Darling, I want my gay rights now! (Karla) There were drag queens, there were lesbian feminists like myself. There were truck boys who had sex in the back of trucks. It was tremendous excitement because we're all moving together and thinking in terms of &quot;we&quot;, not in terms of &quot;I.&quot; (man) Hey, gay is good and gay is great! Our first big action, we had an eating place in West Hollywood which has been there for 20 or 30 years called Barney's Beanery. It's an article about a restaurant in Los Angeles with a sign that says &quot;Faggots Keep Out.&quot; They spelled faggots wrong, F-A-G-O-T, &quot;Faggots stay out.&quot; The gentleman who put this sign up in this restaurant said he thinks that homosexuals should be shot. Two, four, six, eight... I imagine we got between 8 and 10,000 people out. Because our very existence is political right now. (Karla) But the drawback was these meetings were very unstructured and terribly chaotic. People were screaming at each other, people didn't listen to each other. It was a little too much like my family. (man) By '71, people had split off to form, down in New York, Gay Activists Alliance. We worked by Robert's Rules of Order. Our predecessor, Gay Liberation Front had worked by consensus. That's how GAA started by the way. People just couldn't abide with the procedure. ♪♪ (man) You will meet people who will rhapsodize about how the dances at the Firehouse changed their lives. ♪♪ (man) On Saturday nights, we would have a couple thousand people in there sweating and dancing and having a blast. All of us were tripping and stoned having a ball. (Melissa) At the same time, these early gay militants took aim at a number of mainstream institutions. This is what we're going to be doing, babies. This is what we're going to be doing, babies. (man) It was very very clear that a primary obstacle to our getting anywhere was the allegation that homosexuality was an illness, a disturbance. (Barbara Gittings) They had a panel called Psychiatry, Friend or Foe to Homosexuals? Well, it was not easy to find someone who was both openly gay and a psychiatrist in 1972 and we finally landed someone who said, &quot;Yes, I'll do it, provided I can wear a wig and a mask over my face because I'm in fear of losing my job.&quot; (Frank) The APA, like most organizations that have their conventions, has a banquet at some point. There was a dance floor and there was going to be dancing and I knew that. (man) Then we got up and started dancing. We made a beautiful couple. Frank is a very good leader and I can follow very well. (Frank) We dance around with the psychiatrists and their wives dancing around us. (Phil) One of the psychiatrists came over and said he would introduce a motion the following year to make homosexuality no longer considered a sickness and in December of 1974, gay men and women went to bed sick and we woke up the next morning and we were instantly cured. Give me a K! K! Give me an I! I! (Arnie) In the very first days of GAA, we created a street theater committee. We invaded the city clerk's office because a couple of guys tried to register to get married and of course, it was against the law, so he wouldn't allow it. Gay power! Gay power! (man) They brought a wedding cake with two grooms and two brides, separately and took over the office for the day. ♪ I ain't gonna stay in the closet no more ♪ ♪ I ain't gonna stay in the closet no more ♪♪ (Arnie) I don't know how much we changed them, but we started changing at least ourselves and our demands and our expectations. ♪ The dykes are here ♪ ♪ What the hell do we care? ♪ ♪ What the hell do we care? ♪♪ (Karla) The women started to split off for a number of reasons. Some men were very feminist and they were very good, but a lot of the guys were insensitive; they called us girls, they told us that our job was to bake cookies. Betty, do we have a big knife here? (Karla) I mean, they couldn't have been more revolting if they tried. I came to consciousness about my own lesbian sexuality primarily through my involvement in the women's movement and in the feminist movement in the early '70s. (chanting) Double, double, sisters in trouble. When you mess with women you're asking for trouble. (Dorothy) The women's movement was the place where everything changed. I was not a monster. I was not alone. And I had the possibility of preventing what had happened to me from happening to other people. For little tiny lesbians of my age, people coming of age in my era, what made us soar was just this amazing women's movement that was emerging. No matter what any woman ever says today, it was chock full of lesbians. (woman) And lesbians were closeted because they felt like the women's movement could not survive having out lesbians in the leadership or in major roles and that's just fact. (woman) Betty Friedan, may she live in peace, had called us the Lavender Menace. She said the lesbians were going to ruin the women's movement. And there were a lot of lesbians in NOW, including Rita Mae Brown who was ejected from NOW. I was just a kid when I got thrown out of NOW, which of course then, I immediately began calling NOW WHAT, for which they've probably never forgiven me. God forbid you should have a sense of humor about these things. You were supposed to just weep and wail and just immediately become a victim. The more victimized you were, of course, the more of a woman you were and I'm like, &quot;What are you talking about? The women I came from weren't victims; they kicked butt. So I'm going to kick some too, little Yankee girls. Let me show you how this works.&quot; (Melissa) Despite their differences, gay men and lesbians come together a year after Stonewall to commemorate the riot with a march. (woman) If people hadn't decided to commemorate Stonewall with a political march, no one would remember Stonewall. (chanting) Two, four, six, eight, gay is just as good as straight. (man) It was incredible, it was so empowering. (man) We were chanting, there were great signs like &quot;Better Blatant Than Latent,&quot; &quot;Hi Mom.&quot; (man) You know, people chanting, &quot;Two, four, six, eight, gay is just as good as straight,&quot; &quot;Out of the closets and into the streets.&quot; (chanting) Out of the closets and into the streets! Out of the closets and into the streets! (man) There were drag queens and you know, just this mad rag-tag bunch of hippies and freaks and weirdos and you know, we were just all out in force. (man) We got to this little knoll at the Sheep Meadow and we turned around to see what had happened behind us and all of a sudden, we all started to cry together because behind us, there were 15,000 people. This was the moment when the closet door was actually opening and the gay community was coming out into the light. ♪♪ (man) People came to San Francisco because they could be free. This was a unique place where they could be that person they hoped they could be as a lesbian or as a gay person. (man) When I arrived in San Francisco in 1971, there was still a great deal of the old hippie thing going on. The culture hadn't really calcified into that hyper-male thing that happened in the later '70s. (Michael) What it was was a lot of gay men who had been told all their lives they were not real men suddenly being told they could be whatever they wanted to be and some of us wanted to be real men. It didn't mean real men living in the suburbs; it meant real men like dressing up like Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild One.&quot; (Jim) You had in the '70s with the sort of drug culture also changing; you had a different kind of tribal energy. It wasn't about changing the world, it was about getting laid. (Mel) Sex was easy, if you got horny, you just went out and found someone-- it was that easy. The Mineshaft, I would often go on Uncircumcised Night, because I'm uncircumcised and you could get in for free and I didn't have a lot of money in those days. I literally died when I went downstairs and saw this bathtub sitting in a basement and says, &quot;What the hell do they have a bathtub for,&quot; you know? Pretty soon, there was a guy inside the bathtub. Okay, this is an art installation, I can deal with this, you know. (man) All the early disco music was code. It was very much like the '50s and '40s code music, which was cocktail music, which straight people heard one way and gay people heard another way.

People I married. So... I miss all of that. When I felt how it was to lie in someone else's arms, to meet a stranger in the dark and find gentleness and kindness there, from someone that I didn't even know. There really was something truly regenerating about it and it helped me create myself in a way that was quite a different self than the one I'd left behind in North Carolina. I began to re-examine all of my prejudices, my racism, my tenseness as a conservative, all of that fell by the wayside once I realized how good it was to be myself and to enjoy others who were doing the same thing.

That's a nice way of putting it, you know? (chanting) Three, four, seven, nine, lesbians are mighty fine! Three, five, seven, nine, lesbians are mighty fine! (Dorothy) It was a period in history in which each and every one of us felt as if we held history in our hands, as if everything we did had the possibility of changing the world. There was just a tremendous onslaught of little magazines, little presses. The small presses were so fabulous. First, there were all the underground newspapers. (Dorothy) Little coffee shops, little poetry readings, all small. And writ small so it was accessible, you could do it. Christ, the first magazine I worked with, we did on mimeograph. Do you know what a mimeograph machine is? Their hot, bare bodies pressed together as before... And poetry... oh, God, thank God for bad poetry. The main method of communication for me in the early '70s was poetry. Other women's bad poems, my bad poems. And some of them weren't bad. There was some great poetry being written. But it didn't matter. What we were creating was a voice that had not been heard before. (Rita Mae) And so, I sat down and wrote my first novel. And you know, you're supposed to suffer. I loved it. I didn't suffer for one minute. I thought, this is the most fun thing I have ever done in my life. Couldn't get anyone to publish it. So this little tiny press picked it up and published it. They gave me $1,000. And that was how Rubyfruit Jungle started. The issue of racism, you know, I can get on a soapbox, but the issue of racism in the women's movement is such is that many white women everywhere all over this country don't believe that black and white women can work together. I mean, they literally don't believe it. To be a southern working-class woman suddenly joining a group of editorial activists, most of whom were black and they were Yankees, forget that, they were black Yankees with attitude. I met my best friend Jewelle. I remember looking at her and being tremendously afraid, looking in her eyes and seeing that she was looking at me and thinking, &quot;Cracker.&quot; And I'm looking at her and thinking, &quot;Boston.&quot; There was a distinct separation between lesbians of color and white lesbians. ♪♪ (Jewelle) But what grew out of that separation was kind of a cultural fountain of activities. I would go to Brooklyn and see 50 lesbians of color that I never saw anywhere else. (woman) The Combahee River Collective was probably the most important ongoing political involvement of my life. I mean, here was the manifestation of my greatest fear and my deepest desire all on one little packet called other black lrsbians, lots of them! (woman) In the community of lesbians of color, different kinds of social organizations grew up which were specifically social like Salsa Soul Sisters. (Barbara Smith) I remember this one meeting where we decided to talk about the images of black women in the media. This is 1975. And there was a discussion about whether or not straight hair versus afros at the time, versus locks. Afro, straight hair, whatever. Whatever we were looking at, there was no articulation that black women had any right to be on the planet. That's what we were dealing with. Everything we do has got to contribute to the struggle because everything they do is grinding us into dust and we will not be ground. ♪ Hello hooray ♪ ♪ Let the show begin ♪♪ Women started performing at night in the early '70s, everything from church basements to women's centers.

One of them left her husband. We're talking this concert literally changed people's lives. The empowerment had an ongoing impact. It was an extraordinary force. (Jewelle) Oh, God, I would think for me, the women's music festival in Michigan was like Babes in Toyland. (woman) It's from me to you with much love. (Robin) I was the MC. Now they're all in Birkenstocks and... well, the ones that were dressed were in blue jeans. Most of them were in nothing. (Jewelle) I went with a big stack of books and a Thermos of martinis. I arrived and it was like the new moon and there was a group of Salsa Soul Sisters, they were trying to get the tent up at the right angle so that the moon would be where it was supposed to be for the nighttime ritual. And then there was this moment where I said, &quot;Would anybody like a martini?&quot; And they all looked at me like I had lost my mind. But, we did kill off that Thermos of martinis. (Robin) I walked onstage and I declared my area a crystal-free zone and I thought they were going to kill me. Anything ludicrous, I immediately started making fun of. So all of a sudden, the gods of lesbians, excuse me, the goddesses, the goddesses were tofu, vegetarianism. We can make fun of that as much as we like and I like to have a sense of humor about it, but the idea that we can be sensitive to other people, that's an accomplishment. I mean, I would be there watching them unroll the snow fence so that wheelchairs could get up and down the terrain. I would see women stop to help women who were on crutches or who were blind.

(man) I came from, you know, a Pentecostal background, a Southern Baptist background. And they taught us how to start churches. 12 people showed up in the living room of my home. When I served communion, only three people came forward, but there wasn't a dry eye in the place. The next Sunday, we had 16 attendants, 18. I said, &quot;Whoo, hallelujah to the lamb.&quot; Jesus came and died for my sins, not my sexuality. (Gil) This person really spoke a word of affirmation, which was something I never really experienced before and which from a very spiritual place, I was being affirmed. ...Say in those churches. Ain't no hypocrite gonna out-shout me, Amen. (Melissa) If claiming a place in the church was a challenge, cracking the political closet would also be an uphill battle. In 1974, Elaine Noble ran for a seat in the Massachusetts State Legislature. I wasn't prepared, I don't think, for all of the vitriolic part of a campaign. People had shot through my windows, scratched &quot;Lesbian&quot; on the back of my car which totally flipped me out and my friends came out and I'm beating on the back of the car screaming, &quot;The illiterates misspelled it! They misspelled it!&quot; I kept repeating it. It was like the worst insult. Elaine Nobel's victory for many will probably hold significance because she is the first admitted gay person to be state representative. (Elaine) It was staggering. I had a larger constituency of gay folks throughout the country and the world who would call me and say, &quot;You have to come here, you have to help us with this.&quot; And when I'd say, &quot;Look, I have to be in the House to vote, I can't be really be there.&quot; Remember the guy who wrote, he used to live in this state and he's gay, and he moved to California and he wanted me to help him with his welfare check in California. That was the difficult of being the only well known of anything. It is well known that I am a gay person and in this state, there is a law that says gay people cannot be married, but there is no law that says two human beings cannot love one another. (Melissa) And in San Francisco, after four unsuccessful tries, an openly gay man was elected city supervisor. Harvey Milk made national headlines. I remember it really grabbed me when I read that in the newspaper because I'd never seen anything like that before. And I was living in Fargo, North Dakota at the time. (Melissa) In 1975, Time magazine puts its first gay man, Sergeant Leonard Matlovich on the cover. And in 1977, Miami, Florida becomes the first Southern city to pass a gay rights ordinance. However that victory would backfire. ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ His truth... ♪♪ (Anita) I believe that more than ever before that there are evil forces round about us, even perhaps disguised as something good. Anita was the precursor of a whole movement that has turned gay bashing into an art form. The war goes on to save our children because the seed of sexual sickness that germinated in Dade County has already been transplanted by misguided liberals in the US Congress. She took it into her head to form an organization called Save Our Children. Save them from homosexuality is what she had in mind. Who knew anything about the religious right or that people would become professionally anti-gay as we were professionally gay. (chanting) We are your children, we are your children.

(man) When they take to the streets, it's a parade of homosexuals. Men hugging other men. Cavorting with little boys. Even my father was completely confused by the rhetoric of Anita Bryant and the right. One day after hearing her on TV, he called me up and said, &quot;Do you sleep with little boys?&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, Dad, I don't even sleep with big boys.&quot; You talk about that kind of stuff, people get afraid and that fear causes them, motivates them, to join the crusade and to send in money. ♪♪ (man) We lost in Miami and we lost in St. Paul, Minnesota. We lost in Wichita and suddenly we lost in Eugene. And they escalated the stakes in California with a gentleman named State Senator John Briggs.

(man) ...or anyone who encourages or promotes public or private homosexuality. Somebody's gotta draw the moral line in this country and say enough is enough and that's what Anita Bryant did and that's what I'm attempting to do. The first thing I did was wrote a letter to all of my straight friends in politics, in the same letter announcing that I was gay and asking them for a contribution to fight Proposition 6, the Briggs imitative. One of those letters was to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, President Clinton. He was Governor at the time in Arkansas and actually I got an extraordinary response to the letter, I got a contribution. So that brought me out of the closet. To this day, I'm grateful to Anita Bryant for liberating me. (chanting) No more Briggs! No more Briggs!

Supervisor Harvey Milk led a celebration through the streets of San Francisco. 20 days later, he would be assassinated. I'm typing a letter to Harvey and I turn the TV on and the news was broadcasting live from City Hall. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed. (man) Oh, Jesus Christ! And I was sitting here with this letter to this man who was dead. And... mmm. It was like my life had imploded, not exploded. I didn't know what to do about all this. In fact, I'm one the people, I did not go to City Hall in that outrage. I just wanted to get out of San Francisco. (Melissa) For many local gay leaders, the Briggs threat coupled with Milk's assassination emphasized the need for a national political presence. (Rev. Perry) Near the end of the '70s, we knew that we needed a national lobbying group. We set up a group called the Gay and Lesbian National Lobby and a young man emerged who we wanted to lead that. His name was Steve Endean. (woman) All of a sudden, we were building this presence on Capitol Hill and we were not only going to ask them for their votes, but we were watching when they voted against us. (Melissa) The new Gay and Lesbian National Lobby would become the Human Rights Campaign Fund. The National Gay Task Force and Lamda Legal Defense Fund also came into being. This developing national presence was very much on display at the first march in the nation's capital in October 1979. (woman) There was nothing like the 1979 march.

The cause of the outbreak is unknown and there is yet... ...no evidence of contagion. It was scary. I mean, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to look at that article and see that it's an infectious agent. Just look at it, it's like, two plus two equals. And then we thought, poppers or amoebas. I'd done all those things. (man) We knew something was going on much earlier. Friends were dying at Fire Island very mysteriously, one or two or three a year. People were getting sick. We had like, a mad orgy of maybe five or six guys. Within two months of that, both he and I had meningitis. You know, you change the line in the sand.

There was a great deal of resistance within the march organization by some of the march leaders, including Walter Fauntroy, the delegate in the congress for the District of Columbia. He said in one infamous statement that to talk about gay and lesbian rights, he said, &quot;That's like talking about penguin rights.&quot; (Gil) It finally ended up in a confrontation.

Yeah. ♪♪ When rodeo really became anchored initially, leather people had their element and drag queens also had a world that they lived in. And only the cowboys seemed to be left out. ♪♪ (Melissa) While gays and lesbians are striving to maintain a sense of pride, thousands of gay men begin entering hospitals. The gay community is hit by the first tidal wave of death from AIDS. (Karla) People began to get sick in droves. And suddenly a lot of people I knew were sick or were dying. (man) Nobody was doing anything and the reason they weren't treating this as a normal health epidemic was because it was affecting gay men, period. I've never heard once in this chamber anybody say to the homosexuals, &quot;Stop what you're doing.&quot; (man) It was awful. But you know, we made up our minds we're going to fight through this. It kind of was a natural progression to go from this incredible activism around gay civil rights and to sort of take the lessons learned there and apply it to AIDS activism. (Chuck) The decision was made to close the bathhouses. I went to a public meeting there where I feared for my physical wellbeing. The emotion was so high, the people were so concerned that the bathhouses would be closed. (Melissa) In New York City, playwright Larry Kramer invites friends to a meeting in his apartment to hear Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien explain that AIDS is spread by sexual contact. Just to watch, all the faces around the room, panning around. Every kind of reaction imaginable from horror to being asleep. That handful of people started meeting regularly. We didn't have any money. We had to go out and beg for it. The city wouldn't give us dipshit. So when there were no health care organizations that would treat us, suddenly gay doctors formed AIDS practices. We created organizations to deliver food. We created organizations to get money for their rent. The most extraordinary sense of renaissance and renewal in the midst of Holocaust. You're in a support group? That's great. (woman) I think that actually the gay and lesbian community was able to learn a lot from the women's health movement about how to deal with this. Women had been dealing for many years since the publication of Our Bodies, Ourselves, very consciously, of taking our health care into our own hands. (woman) So the gay men, being politicized and radicalized and understanding the linkage with an oppressive health care system and understanding significant family issues, their agenda became a lesbian agenda. That's the way I look at it. (Robin) You see these tough-as-bull dykes talking about how they'll never talk to a man again in the '70s and there they were pushing the wheelchair, making the hospital visits, changing guys and so history brought us back together, this historic happening of AIDS. In the minority community, a lot of information did not get in until very late. It took the black churches a very long time to even acknowledge AIDS. (Renae) When my brother was alive, when he had to get services, he didn't get services where he lived. He went to Timbuktu, because services weren't available where he lived. (Jewelle) You know, when my cousin died, you know, I could see his lovers there, all involved in church. They were there in the choirs, and the preaching and the, you know, they were all there. But why didn't they have that information? (Melissa) At the same time that information about sexuality and safe sex amongst men were proliferating, lesbians were shaking up conventional attitudes about sexuality and pornography within a larger women's movement. (Dorothy) What we were talking about was an open-ended approach to sex. Okay, so women use sex toys, my God. So some women dress up for each other. So some women act out different roles. So some women like to take their girlfriends on the streets in short skirts and walk behind them. This is not like a huge secret or massive revelation. (Jewelle) A number of my friends were targeted and pointed out as their work being pornographic. Joan Nestle because she talked about butch/femme. Gail Rubin because she talked about S/M. And you know, the Meese commission had been going around the country holding these kind of hearings about the damages of pornography. The very limited... (Hilary) I mean, there were many of us who really thought we were about to embark on some other set of kind of McCarthy-like hearings and scare tactics. (Jewelle) The hysteria around it ended up clouding the issues because of course, there are issues around pornography in this society and violence against women, but the hysteria of the right wing ended up closing down the discussion ultimately and putting the discussion back in the hands of the government. But it was all of a sudden as if we had come out of this little tiny safe corner we'd been hiding our sexuality in and it was enormous and dangerous. (Melissa) The sense of danger grips even Capitol Hill as hysteria about sex becomes a topic in the US Congress. (man) Congressman Jerry Studs is on the left of your screen. Studs was censured by the House for his sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male congressional page. Studs announced publicly he is a homosexual. (Melissa) Closeted gay congressmen were being forced to change with the times. I had a lot of gay and lesbian friends, but I still wasn't even out to them. It was bizarre, but I guess I was so terrified of coming out and what finally decided me was the death of Stewart McKinney. The fact that the hideous disease has now claimed a sitting member of Congress is expected to go a long way towards galvanizing... His dying wish was to reveal that the cause of his death was AIDS. I'd known Stewart and I'd known of his bisexuality. I just was so depressed we got into this kind of tug of war, about was he or wasn't he gay. And I said, &quot;You know, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, I'm not going to let this happen to me.&quot; So I just decided I had to do it. His coming out was very important, I think not so much for the country, although for the country too, but so much in Congress happens in those cloakrooms. You really can't discount the importance of having openly gay people in those meetings. (Sheila) When I was first running, I was sitting in a restaurant in Santa Monica, which is in my district, and this guy came barreling up to the table and I thought, oh my God, I'm in for it now. What's he going to do? And he came right up to me and he said, &quot;Sheila, I hate all politicians. They all lie to you, they dissemble, they distort the truth, you can't trust them at all. I hate them all except for you.&quot; And I said, &quot;Me, why me?&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, you already told us the worst thing about yourself. Why would you lie about anything else?&quot; I think we should do away with gays if possible. ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪♪ (man) The wages of sin is death. You want to see the end result of this lifestyle? Then come with me into the hospital and see... (Melissa) In the midst of this growing backlash to homosexuality, the Supreme Court upholds state anti-sodomy laws in its Bowers v. Hardwick decision. Michael Hardwick had been arrested for sodomy in Georgia and appealed his case to the Supreme Court. When he lost, gay people again took to the streets. (man) We planned a major demonstration at the Supreme Court. (Susan) You know, sodomy, abortion, medical care, these were all the same issue. Keep your laws off my body. This is like, nuts. How could this possibly be happening? (man speaking French) (Melissa) Five years and 5,000 deaths into the AIDS epidemic, movie star Rock Hudson dies. And AIDS finally makes the front page. It spurred a lot of people to come into the gay and lesbian community. It spurred a lot of straights to support us more and more. But the greatest coming out process was testing HIV-positive. Sometimes I'm introduced as I am today, and I'm proud of it, to be HIV-positive. (David) And they had no choice but to come out. And the question is, do you come out and be defeated in life and a victim or do you come out as a warrior and fight back? That was one of the things that motivated me to come to San Francisco was I thought I might only have six months to live. In San Francisco, you could do something. It wasn't just about coming and dying or getting sick or waiting to die, it was really about coming and doing something. ♪♪ (man) So that's one of the reasons that Act Up was formed. It is appalling... (Vivian) Larry Kramer called that meeting at the center. The very first demonstration was on Wall Street at Burroughs Wellcome. That was my idea to close down Wall Street. I mean, we couldn't lose down Burroughs Wellcome, but we could close down Broadway. How many people did you kill today? (Vivian) A lot of people were willing to get arrested for Act Up. That's what brought me to Act Up, the level of homophobic hysteria. ...To promote a perverted lifestyle, a lifestyle that brings forth death. People, you know, for the first time, a friend of mine was walking across the street for years and somebody yelled out, you know, &quot;Faggot.&quot; That hadn't happened in a while. United in anger and committed in direct action to end the AIDS crisis. (Maxine) It was very open, anybody could say anything. You could stand up and if you had a good idea, people would do it. (Larry) Again, a lot of it, as I said, was motivated by fear. This is the probably the last time I'm going to be here. There wasn't a meeting where somebody didn't come up to me and say, &quot;do you know of anything that's coming along? I just know, I just feel I don't have much time left.&quot; At about the same time that Larry Kramer was talking about setting up an organization, I was in London getting together a group of gay men to set up a similar organization. By now, Act Up chapters were opening around the country and people literally from around the country, maybe as far away as Canada, came and descended on the Food and Drug Administration. I was part of a group called Wave Three and we were all wearing white lab coats with bloody hands on the backs. (Charles) The use of blood, the use of the Silence = Death slogan, those are truly important visual tools that we were able to take advantage of. You know, some are too shocking for other people, but at that time in our lives, the shock value was important. They were just not paying attention to us. (Mike) Some of the aspects and some of the things that they did, I didn't understand why they did it. But I know in my heart that because they did it, things have changed today. (speaking Spanish) Health care is a right! (Vivian) The beauty of Act Up, it put fear in the hearts of individuals. It became a protagonist, it became the bad guy. But it became the very smart bad guy. It knew all the stuff about drugs. It was a powerhouse of information and research. What Act Up and people like myself were trying to do was challenge that orthodoxy. Unless there are parallel drug trials that address the way drugs function inside women's bodies, we will never... And say, hang on, it's the patient that has the right above everybody else to know the facts and to make their own informed decision. Health care is a right! Health care is a right! I didn't mind calling up somebody's doctor I didn't have to have a relationship with and saying, &quot;Well, you seem to have washed your hands of this guy. 'Cause there's shit all over the walls and he's having convulsions and your office isn't taking his calls. So what are you going to do?&quot; ♪♪ (Charles) I have mixed feelings about what Act Up did inside the church. I don't like Cardinal O'Connor, I do not believe in his politics, but I will respect the church for what it is. People were afraid of us. That's what made us. Drug companies did what we wanted them to do because we had gone into St. Patrick's. We were no longer the limp-wristed effeminate person; we were men in jeans and boots who would infiltrate a mass. Stop killing us! We're not gonna take it anymore! You're killing us! Stop it! Stop it!

(Phil Reed) There was this larger than life figure on our stage and he was the only prominent politician in the country who would come to the rally. (Jesse) Everybody must have equal protection under the law in the real America. At the 1987 march, people would bring their ideas and they'd want to get it sponsored by the march. It was about a quilt, some kind of a quilt. He wanted to bring a quilt. They thought it was a sewing bee. They didn't understand a quilt. And none of us really understood it. I didn't know what to make of it at first. It had this funny name, the Names Project. I didn't understand what it was until I actually walked on to the field, and saw and started to walk around and see also the reaction of other people who were looking at the panels. This was the first time that anyone had ever done this kind of memorial. I think the quilt, our AIDS quilt, is one of the most inspired ideas of the 20th century. (man) I have found it therapeutic to make a panel. There was one leader of the gay community and his favorite song was &quot;There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover.&quot; So when I made his panel, I put bluebirds on it, you know. And underneath it, I wrote &quot;Memory Maker.&quot; And this was him. One particular quilt, I'll never forget it. The two arms were sewn together and then two white gloves and two officers holding hands. Obviously, they had been partners. They both had passed from AIDS.

Well, I got news for them... (man) The whole NEA thing was just a way of attacking homosexuality by certain politicians. Jesse Helms is very right. He does not want people to see queers living real lives where they actually take care of their children. (woman) I was walking down the street here in North Hampton and a woman stopped me and she said that she and her female lover had just started a family and they had no books to read to their daughter that showed their kind of family and somebody should write one. So I said, &quot;Well, I'm somebody.&quot; So I wrote the book. I never expected it to be taken up by the radical right, to be taken up by the Lesbian Avengers. Joseph Fernandez commissioned a committee to come up with a multi-cultural curriculum. They came up with a 443-page bibliography of suggested texts to use in the classroom about all kinds of families, including gay and lesbian families. Somehow, that got twisted into, &quot;Look, lesbians want to steal your children and recruit them into their lifestyle,&quot; which is ridiculous. I mean, when I grew up, I read thousands of books about straight people. Not one of them changed my sexuality. I don't know any religion that accepts homosexuality. When you take my child, you are teaching her something that is against a parent's religion and that is a violation of that parent's and that child's religion under the First Amendment. (Leslea) The Lesbian Avengers showed up at a school in her district on the first day of school with lavender balloons that said Teach Us About Lesbians. (Maxine) And we had big balloons that said Ask About Lesbian Lives and we had a marching band that played things like &quot;We Are Family.&quot; (Leslea) So that's what I mean about everyone using the book for their own agenda. You know, things escalated, things got really ugly. Joseph Fernandez lost his job. Heather was kicked off the Rainbow curriculum. It was a real mess. Hey, hey, ho, ho... (indistinct chanting) (Melissa) For a short period in the early '90s, the activist style pioneered by Act Up was expanded upon by a younger generation calling itself Queer Nation.

The place was full of all these queers of many colors and many of who had never been in their own union hall before. And Stanley Hill who was the director at that time, he stood up and he said, &quot;Make no mistake about it, we know that we need you even more than you need us.&quot; (Charles) You know, living in New York, we always think that we've seen everything or have done everything. ♪♪ (Melissa) Gay life was now being seen in small town America. Since coming to New England, when I first moved here, I could walk down the street and people just like, kind of knew and some people would chuckle or whatever. I know of a town, small town here, had kind of a guy, he had AIDS, was dying of AIDS, went to school and told them what caused AIDS and what should they not do and everything and they really fell in love with the guy. They made sure they had an overstuffed chair there where he could come and visit and he visited right up to the week he died. (Melissa) Along with this greater openness came a new wave of right wing organizing that would target rural states with small gay communities. We're here today to announce the formation of the Oregon Christian Coalition. We don't think that homosexuals, heterosexuals, sadists, masochists, polygamists or any other person based on their private sexual conduct should receive preferential status under the law. (Melissa) In Oregon, the Citizens Alliance, supported by the Christian Coalition, gathered signatures for a statewide anti-gay bill called Measure 9. It was defeated. But Colorado's referendum, Amendment 2, was passed by its voters. It felt like we'd been kicked in the stomach. It was just overwhelming. There was one body of people who got very scared and sort of felt like they needed to retreat back into the closet. There was a whole other group of people who said, &quot;We're not going to take it anymore. We're coming out and we're going to be active and we're going to be involved.&quot; (Leslie) There was a large community gathering down on the courthouse lawn and I spoke to people and basically said, &quot;We will fight it.

Ypsilanti passed a pro-human rights ordinance that listed every possible thing, skin color, religion, origin, sexual orientation.

And in the closing days of the campaign, they brought in Reggie White, black football player for the Green Bay Packers who's been very anti-gay in his sentiments. (woman) Tell me what you came here for tonight. I came here to preach the gospel. That's what it boils down to. When I mention, the Bible says that homosexuality was a sin, I am personally attack anyone. (Mandy) But some of the black folks in Ypsilanti said, &quot;Wait a minute. If they're bringing in black folks to try to organize in the black community to come after gay folk, we better be doing something. So we're going to have a non-violent vigil outside of the venue.&quot; The day comes, they're there. They might have had 400 in that venue, 99% white, which meant what-- the black community said, &quot;We get it, we're not interested,&quot; didn't show up. That was a win. (Melissa) On the national level, Bill Clinton in his presidential campaign quoted the gay community. Them, the gays. We've gotten to where we've nearly &quot;themmed&quot; ourselves to death. Them and them and them. This is America. There is no them. There is only us. (man) So celebrate tonight. This is your victory. You earned it. You worked for it. You paid for it.

(Melissa) It caused immediate furor in Congress. Clinton called his friend and political advisor David Mixner and asked for six months' breathing space. (David) And I said, &quot;What I need to know is at the end of that six months, that you will definitely say there will be an executive order that we will not back down from that now that we're in the middle of a battle.&quot; And he said, &quot;I promise you.&quot; (Melissa) Clinton broke his promise and instituted the policy known as Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

I have to say that people didn't go and become empowered, but the kind of media production focus that the march had kind of took away from some of the personal success, in my own opinion. (Robin) So we had all these people that had been thrown out of the military, like Grethe Cammermeyer and then they had Allen Schindler's mother come up and give a speech about Allen and what had happened to him. You know, he was a sailor that was murdered because he was gay. I don't want any mother to ever have to go through what I'm going through. Faith, hope, love. Abide these three and the greatest of these is love. (Melissa) In Denmark, Axel and Eigil Axgil become the first legally married gay couple. In the United States, gays and lesbians began the legal fight for the right to marry. I mean, six people wanting to get married caused more horrific panic in Washington than the Lesbian Avengers or Act Up ever did. Flames of hedonism, the flames of narcissism, the flames of self-centered morality are licking at the very foundations of our society. (David) The Clinton administration panicked. Bill Clinton, again, without consulting anyone, and this I find one of the most shameful episodes, announced that he would sign DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which would make it against the law for gays and lesbians to be married. I testified before Congress on the Defense of Marriage Act and Hilary had given me a ring to wear that day. And sitting at that table, being shredded by these horrific members of Congress that were throwing me like red meat to the right wing, it made me want to get married. (man) When Jeff presented my ring to me, it was in crowded restaurant on Main Street in King, New Hampshire. At the table next to us, there were probably... It was a big family. At that point, I think everyone dropped their fork and kind of looked at us. To love and to cherish? To love and to cherish.
