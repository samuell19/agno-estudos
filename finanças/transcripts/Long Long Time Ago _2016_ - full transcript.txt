We are in trouble this time! Wondered who were the blind ones to elect them as the Government So many people unemployed Does this Government really know what to do? We are in deep shit How about we return to Malaysia? The Chinese are the majority here That's true too Coming How awe-inspiring! People's Action Party Impressive People's Action Party Thank you! People's Action Party People's Action Party Boy, what are you cheering for'? Don't know People's Action Party Not long after, for no rhyme or reason, many foreign corporations started opening factories here Everyone was thus able to get jobs They had a stable income, and even received CPF That's right CPF is having the Government use our money to do compulsory savings for us when we are in need of it, we aren't able to retrieve it It can only be used for buying flats Isn't it our money'? Why can't we take it out? I'm young and can't comprehend the reasons behind it Perhaps when I'm older, I'll understand Mother and Uncle Osman grabbed hold of this opportunity and applied for a stall in the American factory They will be able to avoid the inspectors, and the gangsters' harassment No spoons We use our hands Delicious You pinch it like this Mix it Eat Tasty Try it No thanks Heaven is fair Little did one expect that the person-in-charge of the factory to be Mr Teo, Mothers regular customer We were thus able to get a stall Mr Teo really is our benefactor The illegal street hawkers were chased to start business at the newly built markets As rental was cheap, even Uncle Ah Kun who was always complaining about the Government went to apply for a stall to sell vegetables Aunty, are your hands itching? You keep pinching my vegetables Are you going to buy them? They are not fresh They won't be with the way you pinch them Hello everybody The inspector is here Morning everyone Don't be afraid How do you do? I am no longer the inspector I work for the People's Association now He is the Member of Parliament (MP) you elected He is here to call on everyone You are the MP? Yes You look so different from the photos ls that so? But that doesn't matter I just find it unfair that our stall's are allocated by balloting Why do you say that? Take a look Those stalls in front are earning big bucks People will just buy from them and leave Who will patronise from stalls at the back? Look Not a mosquito in sight All the vegetables I purchased are still left over It has been a week and they are still unsold Even fresh vegetables will become stale This gentleman over here, balloting for stall spots is just With so many people balloting, there are bound for some to be in front and some at the back However you need not worry There are many flats that are being built around Yes.

Of course not On voting day, after I got the voting slip I saw a box next to "People's Action Party" And I wrote a cross A cross means you don't select him What? Are you an idiot?

This is the last of my fortune You aren't allowed to sell them I haven't gambled in a long while The most I did was buying lottery tickets Just think if Heaven was going to bless you with riches and you didn't place your bet, there is nothing Heaven can do too. Right? So you still have to place some bets Place some bets and have hope If you really have to bet, bet legally Small amount of gambling will do Even if it's lottery tickets you need to know your limit and not bet excessively Honestly if you will strike, even one lottery ticket will win you the top prize if you have no luck, even if you sold me to gamble, you'll lose everything I got it Stop nagging If you're going to drive the unlicensed taxi, and with our vegetable stall doing badly, maybe we should just close our business Bring it here Unlicensed taxi Buss, give us a better price Just this amount'?

In that era, for some unknown reasons, boys were precious while girls were nut But strangely, as a female, one never found any wrong with it and accepted it Learning from the 1964's racial riot, the Government was worried that rumors would spread and worsen the situation Hence, they sent staff from Community Centers to villages to explain the situation appealing for the crowd to keep calm Ai yo, what happened? How did things turn out like this? How would I know why it happened?
