THE BEACON THE MEN ON THE ISLAND: THE WOMEN ON THE ISLAND: ON THE MAINLAND: October 1901. The three-masted schooner 'Fortuna II' has reached its destination. It's an island surrounded by perilous skerries and riffs. No trees, no bushes. Sharply edged cliffs, or eroded by storm and time. And yet it's inhabited by fishermen with their wives and children. Their lives and toil are hard like the ground they live on. Fortuna II takes in the fishermen's catch on open seas. For there is no port on the island. Once the fish are stored away and the bargain sealed, the wives come onboard. Like a floating marketplace, the schooner brings the indispensable and many dispensable items. Even the merchant covers his needs here. A hearty drink to seal the eventful day. None of the men suspects what has been decided before. This was Fortuna II's last voyage. Then the great storms arrived. They were left with only what chance and the raging sea brought to their island. Floatsam. And yet Christmas is coming. So what? There are children in the village. They'd be so happy. Children need bread and fat and shoes. I probably shouldn't tell you this. The brown cardigan I had, your husband traded it for you. The knitted cardigan? Traded? What did he trade for the cardigan? Don't tell him that I told you. Floatsam. He really parted with this? It wasn't easy for him. Oh, dear me. My old man parted with a whole bottle of booze. I hope he's not taking ill. You should get him in the ground now. There's no hurry. In this damn winter the dead keep longer than the living. I have proper fire wood. I'll get it first. Dear me. What's this? Is it for me? Yes. For your backache, I thought. Oh my. What a surprise. It must have been very dear. And this? I recognise this. For your sore throat, I thought. Why? I never mentioned a sore throat. No? I must have heard wrong. Never mind. I can take it back, then. No, it's different. I never mentioned my sore throat so you wouldn't worry, you see? However… my throat is sore after all. A dry, nasty scratching in my throat. It's awful. Let's keep the wood. It's still wet. It wouldn't burn before the weekend. The merchant pays a few pounds of flower for it. I just don't know. It's better this way. Hey, what's the idea? It's mine. I saw it first. Leave it. You know I was here first. That's ancient beach law. Ancient beach law - don't be ridiculous. I make my own law. You're asking for trouble. Go home then. Wait. I have to talk to you. Leave me alone. Hey, listen. It's not about the damn piece of wood. Let's split it and be done with it. It's the other thing. How can two people who always share a boat go for each others' throats over a chunk of wood? Don't you get what this means? - I don't know what got into me- - But I know. Something has to give. Otherwise we'll kill each other on this damn island. And flour. And three barrels of good lard. And Spanish wine. Remember, Father? The nice wine. I remember it well. Asti espumante it was called. Listen to my old man. It's been over 20 years. But the name of the wine he still recalls precisely. Back then, the winter was just as hard. Lots of snow. But overnight, the entire stretch from the beacon to the Northcliff became colourful. There were things some of us had never laid eyes on before. There was chocolate. It had become a bit salty in the water. But the children didn't care. Dear me. We couldn't budge for three days. We'd eaten so much. I think… the ship had sailed from America. "Lypsos" was its name. It broke apart in the middle. It's pointless. Totally pointless. Listen, how it howls. No boat can make it in that. My God. Who'd have those ideas in this weather? I don't know. It was a… strange night… back then. No lights… anywhere. There was no more oil… and no more candles. And the beacon… I don't know what was wrong… with the beacon back then. It wasn't lit. That's why… the ship hit… the Northcliff. Why are you all silent? You must think I'm asleep. You mustn't talk so much. It's bad for you. For once, the house is full with visitors, an I'm not supposed to talk. Or are you leaving? I won't hold it against you. Old folk are really dull. And chocolate for the children. And the beacon… wasn't lit. I think she fell asleep. Apparently there were things there you only find in posh city shops. Flour and lard. Chocolate for the children. Apparently it was a swell freighter. She fell asleep very peacefully, her face as though all those fine things were still on the northern beach. I don't know. I was only four back then. - Why wasn't the beacon lit back then? - Why? Hey, you! Why wasn't the beacon lit back then? See you all later. That's our lighthouse keeper. Why? I'm just saying, that's our lighthouse keeper. Swell guy, isn't he? Well, it'll do for another four shots. So it's come to that with you, a fellow has to get soused if he wants to warm up a little? You should know me better. He's quite a guy… that lighthouse keeper. If it wasn't for him… You keep going on about him. What if it wasn't for him? Yeah, what if it wasn't for him? I've given this some thought. That man up there, he is sitting pretty. Oh yes. He lights the lamp once. At dusk. At dawn he extinguishes it. For that he gets paid, gets provisions to last all winter. Swell, isn't it? You all believe in the Good Lord, don't you? Yes. So there's the sea, created by the Good Lord. The storms, also created by the Good Lord. As are the cliffs. Who do you think made our Northcliff? The Good Lord. He created us too, and our island. But I've never heard that the Good Lord created a lighthouse. That is man-made. And the man sitting in the lighthouse, he's a civil servant. That's not God's will either. You will not slaughter it. None of your damn business. Do you want us all to croak? It's my cow. I can do what I like. No, you can't. There are three infants, and a new mother who depend on the milk. You know what that means. If it croaks, the meat's only good for sea gulls. The cow's life depends on you. As you can see, it won't last much longer. Slaughtering it now means I can sell the meat. We'd all benefit from 500 to 600 pounds. Oh well. Since you want to take responsibility. So… I wouldn't want to be you. What are you thinking? Nothing. What bliss. Why are you laughing? I'm thinking of back when we bought the chairs. What exactly? The man who sold them to us said, "They'll last a lifetime, lady." - Are you sorry I burnt them? - Not at all. I'm just pleased we bought four of them. - Does my arm bother you? - No. It's all right. It's on again. Off. It's back on. What's bugging you? Off. Back on. It's nothing. It's only that story. What story? About the ship crashing on the Northcliff. Because the beacon wasn't lit. Back then. "…mileage from cliffs…" due to currents. "What's mileage from cliffs due to currents?" - What's the matter? - The Northcliff. Will it run aground, Father? Nonsense. Thanks to the beacon no ship runs aground. - Good night, then. - Good night. By the way… That was a Tarn liner out there. Not interested. I don't care about ships that pass. But those that arrive, like the Lypsos back then… - Good night. - Good night. …carrying flour and lard, onto on the cliffs, you are interested in those. Oh, shut your trap. What is it? Here, they're all noted down. The "West End Star" on the eleventh. The "Merry Gloucester" on the fourteenth. The "Leviathan" sailed on the seventeenth. It was that one. It's all noted down here. But your clever book doesn't know when the "Fortuna" arrives, eh? "Leviathan". "Gross registered tonnage: 5.300." "Leviathan," "gross registered tonnage: 5.300." "Rounds Northcliff…" "at 11.07 o'clock." Another three hours. What happens in three hours? High tide happens. I wasn't going to tell you. You must be sleepy. A few of us want to try. Including you? Yes. Oh my God. I knew it. In this storm… By night and fog. I wouldn't have allowed it. But you don't want to starve. Take the rudder. Steer. You have the least reason to cry. Yours is the best boat. You're right. It's the best boat on the island. The sail is rotten. Anyway, all boats are equally bad. There was I thinking, "Where's he going with the net in the middle of the night?" I thought, it's for the brother-in-law. They'll be repairing it. They can't sleep. They went about it cunningly. My husband said, they'd be at the merchant's. That he had booze. That one of them was buying a round. Hello, you. Say, you've been running out of chairs. Apparently. You use them to make soup? Not exactly. Sit on the bed if you like. Oh, no. I'd rather not. All alone among all this womenfolk. Let's stop. We're the last. The others all gave up. - Let go! - Damn! - I'd rather drown than that. - That's madness. His boat took him back and he went to bed. We have to turn around. Change course. Go home. Are you mad? Don't you know at home we'll run out of food in two days? Let your wife come over. I'll spare a few bits of dried fish. One day more or less, it won't make any difference. Thank God. They're back. All of them. With no catch. At least they all came back alive. It's a big risk with this weather. You don't say. In the past people trusted me. They used to visit me at the lighthouse. I often gave good advice. But lately… I've been kept out of the loop. Times are so tough, you can't help anybody with mere advice. That could be why. The sailmaker's child is dead. This morning at 6 o'clock. It died although it hadn't been ill. The way you say that… as though I was responsible. No, not you. Even your life isn't worth a farthing. What does that mean? People are haunted by the old story. The one about the Lypsos. That's why they're avoiding you. Back then, when the beacon wasn't lit. So that's what they're asking of me. No. Nobody's asking anything of you. But you have to understand. Our men run up and down the northern beach all day like hungry wolves. They stare at the sea with one hope only: floatsam. You're in their way. You and your beacon. You're imagining things. Do you think any of them could harm me? Do you think somebody might put out the beacon by force? In misery everything is possible. I dare anybody. Is it possible in this weather to get to the mainland? What for? What's your plan? I'll have to discuss it with the others. Perhaps, if we gathered anything that's sellable… to buy food with the proceeds on the mainland… even week's worth of food… it's worth a try. A three-masted bark. "Three masted-bark." One, two, three, four. Linen: 4 times. "Linen: 4 times." Look at that. A violin. "A violin in case." - A box with shells. - "Box with shells." A grandfather clock. Brass-plated. "A grandfather clock. Brass-plated." A cardigan. An oil painting. "Oil painting." In case you could use it. "Accordion." Well then, have a safe trip. All right. - It's suicide in this weather. - Why? It's a good boat. On land, yes. Well, the "Axa" ain't a bad boat. I'm supposed to give you this. Nobody must miss this, "Walking Lene" in action. That is, her back-and-forth, ladies and gents. Ladies and gents, that's right. It's something for the little ones. It's all for laughs here, and no tears. It's the nicest Christmas present for young and old, ladies and gents. This is a one-time opportunity. It can't be helped. The low-pressure piston needs to go. - Oh crikey. - The codger'll curse when he finds out. How long will it take? If it wasn't for the holidays… But as it stands, three to four days. Might take longer. The codger is upstairs. Talk to the captain. Somebody has to break it to him. - That someone'll have to be you. - Leave me alone. Let's finish up here. I'm off to the Christmas market in case anybody fancies it. What are you good for? This shouldn't happen on departure day. …shouldn't look like this. - I'm an engineer, not clairvoyant. - No answers of that ilk! - Are you paying for the loss or I? - The ship's owner will have to pay. The engineer said before we set sail that the engine needed an overhaul. That's the truth-- Truth! I'll lose a fortune! Four to five days! I'll lose a fortune! Don't just stand there. Do something! May I see the other sheet once more? - There you go. - Yes, well. So you prefer this one? If I may, do take this sheet for 1.100. It's worth a lot more. - You may be right. - You can trust me. - May I post it to you? - Please do. But on Christmas Eve. - It's a gift for my wife. - I see. I'll pay for it now. It's not necessary, dear doctor. All right. After the holidays. - There you are. - Thanks. My sincere thanks, doctor. Honour us again soon. - Regards to your wife. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. Bye. - And to you. Bye. - How can I help? - I want to sell a picture. It's a painting. I see. An oil-painting. The frame is a bit worse for wear. The sea was rough and the picture was stored badly. You don't say. - Don't you like it? - No, I do. The composition is pretty. A clean job. The contrasting blue against the beach… No, it's pretty. But alas the theme is a coast. Please believe me, lady, it's impossible up here to sell of a subject of this kind. Impossible. Don't miss the "Walking Lene" in action. That is, her back and forth, ladies and gents. It's the nicest Christmas present for young and old. See how she runs, sways, jumps, ladies and gents. Only a heartless mother, wouldn't gift her child the little, running, enchanting Lene. Get lost, boy! Ladies and gents! This is simple. It's Childs' play. Anybody can do it. How about it, miss? What, no children? Step right up, I won't bite. A great gift for the holiday of love! Evening, ladies and gents! Step right up! This is a one-time opportunity! The sensation of the Christmas market, ladies and gents! How much for the ship? I said, how much is it? Well, it's a three-masted barque, designed after the Brigand, which a few years ago-- Spare me the tall tales. How much you want for it? What did you have in mind? All this bric-a-brac barely covers the cost of fuel for this trip. - It'd leave us without food. - What, that? All told, it doesn't add up to one decent meal for everyone. I stood there like a village idiot with my stuff. "Step right up, ladies and gents." "Come and buy an accordion." "Four years' worth of saving of a little fisherman's lad." "Price now: half a loaf of bread." "And this…" "belonged to an old man." "A set of linen." "He's lying on a sack of straw, hoping I buy food with the proceeds." Yes, it's pointless. There has to be another way. I always told my husband: one day she'll come. I can't tell you how happy I am. So, you're doing poorly? Gosh, I'm terribly sorry. My husband says, this location is awkward, economically-geographically speaking. Well, our locations hasn't changed. I think it's due to cosmic disturbances. Are you familiar with the influence exerted by sun spots? They influence all disasters. I know nothing about that. Fish is so healthy. We eat lots of fish. You probably remember this. - Home made. What a pity… - Thank you. …my husband is busy. He'd have loved to say hello. He always says, "A capable housekeeper like her we'll never find again." Maybe another time. And regarding the painting… Oh, dear. Not so close to Christmas. You can try after the holidays. But I'm positive you'll sell it yet. A painting has enduring value. Typical insurances. Pure cut-throats. They wouldn't… have paid out… a farthing if anything had happened. To have the Fortuna overhauled, I don't have the means for that. I purchased this freighter. Makes a change from the Fortuna, doesn't it? 1.850 tons. One's trying to move up in the world. - But you can't just-- - Well, naturally, for you personally I spare something. But I don't keep cash here. There. If you hurry, the bank is around the corner, next to the church. CITY BANK INN Closed. Everything's closed. Perhaps the waiting room is still open. A cheque? I can't do it. I only work here. Rejoice in your lives He can't cash it. He only works here. I see. A person. A real person remains in this hole. Hello there! You mustn't do this. You mustn't leave me alone, you. We're all people, aren't we? We'll have one more round, shall we? Look, you… You're my friend, aren't you? You have to tell your wife not to… not to glare so angrily. Look. I'm a person. You're a person, too. Your wife is also a person. However, she ought to… She ought to have a drink. A cheque? I don't want a cheque. You're my guests. I'm buying for all of you. - I was hoping you could cash it. - I'm buying for all of you. Buying for all of you. Inn keeper, another round. I'm buying for the whole place. A cheque. Why a cheque. There. Cash money. There. Four hundred heads of cattle. Baffles you, doesn't it? Christmas boom. A cheque. Take better care of your money. Money? Money is dirt. People! Get what I'm saying? People. What now? Now they're going away. Why don't you say something? I know what you're thinking. Yes! I wanted to steal the money. From that fat, pissed bastard. I'd do it again tomorrow, trust me. He'll drink it away or lose it in the gutter. Listen. This is don't wish on you: The dead of your child this winter… of starvation. - Seventeen. - "In those days, Caesar Augustus issued" "a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world." "This was the first census that took place" "while Quirinius was governor of Syria." Oh, stop, mate. It's mighty long ago that Augustus… - was country bleeder. - Leader! - Leader. - Country leader. Yes, Jamaican is better. - You should have been a country vicar. - Leave him. Have a drink. Boatswain. Look what I found in the cable sack. The scrawny lad planned to settle on our tub. But his legs are too long. Half a meter's worth of them stuck out. Like an ostrich. Head in the sand and thinks he's invisible. You're lucky we caught you. The old codger doesn't think much of stowaways. Where are you from? Are you in trouble? Are you hungry? He's so talkative, I can't keep up. If we take you to the captain, you'll talk. I bet he's thirsty, boatswain. Let him alone. Don't worry about him. All right. Keep celebrating. He'll tell me what happened. All right, lad. Take a seat. Tell me all about it. Not like that. Let's talk man to man, shall we? …I just couldn't stand it anymore. So you abandoned your tub. Now you want to see the world, go anywhere. Don't you know that no sailor, no decent person abandons ship or his mates, because it's better elsewhere? Stick it out. Make it better. That's what real men do. That's what you want to be, don't you? Yes. "But the angel said to them," "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy" "for all the people." "Today a Saviour has been born to you." "He is the Messiah, the Lord in the town of David." "This will be a sign to you:" "You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." "Suddenly a great company…" We have an understanding. You're returning to your boat. Better not to mention this. One day you'll set out. "…And peace on earth…" Get him to stop. - It's so long ago. - You should stop boozing. Join me, get some fresh air. You can join me too if you want. I got something to say. Come along, you! Comforter of the soul. - What, you're still here? - Him, too. A nativity story from today. See that trawler there? It says "Axa" on the prow. It's moored there for eight days. Directly alongside 2.500 tons of fat, flour, rice, sugar, and the rest of our cargo. We transport our cargo 2.000 sea miles across the sea. A day and a half's voyage from here people die a death… of starvation. A mere fraction… of our cargo… could save them. Why don't we fill up their tub? Their tiny tub. Using what, though? - The derrick. - Shut up, man. We always use the derrick. We'll see the island on our voyage. Or the beacon. - But we can't help them. - Boatswain. How much is a fortune exactly? When you're poor it's but a few sous, pence or pfennigs. And for our codger? It's more than you can booze in a lifetime. So how come he's "losing a fortune"? - Because he pays his own passage. - That's why he was raging. So all the stuff down there is his? He sounds like a customs officer. The Rio Pecos just screams it. It's no trade ship. It's a grocer's ship. Let me guzzle up the Atlantic and the Rea Sea if the codger refuses to load up that tub to the hatch cover. - It'd be swell, but-- - But what? It'd be swell, boatswain. We could do it. If we start work on the piston right now. Everybody helps, day and night. We can fix in two days, can't we? - In the middle of the night? - On Christmas Eve? - Nobody can demand that. - That's right. Nobody. But we can. However… - Under one condition. - One demand. Lad, didn't I say fresh air was good for you? If he loads up that tub… using his cargo… the Rio Pecos will be ready to sail in 24 hours. And if he refuses? He won't. For his own sake. Let's go. Quiet, children. Don't be wild. Gather around here. Go on. We'll sit over there. Go. There you go. Well, you can barely keep your eyes open. I'll manage. Go and get some shut-eye. I'm taking over. I'll be horizontal. If I'm lost, I'll ask someone or wake you. Keep going. The fact the ship-owner is making a profit on this, makes me turn blue in the face. Forget it. We got what we wanted. If we get it done on time, he has to load up the tub. If we manage this, it'd be the best Christmas of my life. Heave! And go! When the sails are set for home Lend a hand The faster get we going Come outside! …the sky is big and swell A starboard storm… Hey, what's the idea? You must be mistaken. Quick, unload it. More's on the way. Batten down hatches, ready the sails I kiss you I kiss your lips and your hair - Do you understand this? - Hurry up. Off home with you! Remember the hour Because on the floor of the sea You'll rest for good They're rooted to the spot. Let's go and help them stow it away. This is for us? But who gave it to us? Who asked you to do this? Remember the hour Because on the floor of the sea You'll rest for good Don't ask questions. Lend a hand. But this must come from someone. It's from a few men who've learned to stick together when it counts. But listen. We can't accept this. How about the cheque? It's not exactly a lot. Nope. It's not exactly a lot. Excuse me, please. Is that the steamer 'Polaris'? - No, it's the 'Rio Pecos'. - I see. The 'Polaris' is in pier three. - Over there? - No, over there. Thank you. Come on, children. This way. Look after her. She needs it. Stay with us for a while. You shouldn't be alone now. Well, he'll be back. Shut the door. The heating's on. This is no shop. This is a sauna. A distinguished guest. - Take your hats off, everybody. - Leave him alone. I seem to bother you. Right now or generally speaking? I wouldn't know why I bothered you generally. I'm carrying out my duty. Can you understand? Perhaps I'm doing… more than my duty. Very well spoken, "More than your duty". If you need someone to witness it, come see me. - What are you implying? - Nothing. Just that, it's very well, doing more than one's duty. My God, what's that? I ran all the way to the Northcliff. Again nothing, I thought. Mouldy and rotten. Merry Christmas. Over. It's over. No more meat. No more milk. I wanted to slaughter it. I knew it would happen. But no. He knew better. - Him up there knows everything better. - You're lying! See for yourself, in the stable. Mince meat, 400 to 500 pounds. He threatened me! Stop bawling. It's not about the damn meat. - What do you want? - You never used to lock yourself in. - Get lost. - We could get to you before. And now? - What is it you want? - To put out the beacon before we croak. - I give the orders here! - You're a rogue, a coward. You're letting us all die. Murderer! "Villain." "Coward". Homecoming. He's out. Finally. But he won't be sleeping long. He'll want to be breast-fed. And I… Not even that. The beacon. Don't just stand there. Do what I tell you! Extinguish the lights in your houses and fetch your lanterns. Place them on the cliffs. - What's the matter? - Don't ask, Mother. Go to bed. I'll lie down for an hour. - You know what you're doing? - All good, captain. Around midnight, beacon three points off the starboard. Wake me then. I want to be on deck when we pass the flume. - Keep watch now. - Sleep well, captain. Good night. How many revolutions? I asked you to wake me. The beacon isn't in sight yet. It should be, according to the charts. How odd. - Was the light on? - It was out. Surf noise from starboard! Surf noise from starboard! Surf noise ahead from starboard! Go slow! Sound depth! We're stuck! The damn boat. - Where are the children? - Scattered to the winds. Let the heavenly messenger gather them. Damn! Take them to the bridge. Hand out the life vests! Save us! We're running aground. Domini salvenos perimus. Lord, have mercy! We pray for the lives of the children! Domini salvenos perimus. Give us a hand, vicar. Rosaries don't float. The boats! Squall's coming. Fill them amidships. Watch out. Life boats. Fucking hell. Nobody's paying any mind. Close all hatches. Captain, impossible to get the children into the boats. Try your best. Have no fear. Know that the Lord is with you. Signal, "S.O.S." "All life boats destroyed. Have children on board." "S.O.S. All life boats destroyed." "Have children on board." "All…" "life…" "boats…" "Des…" "troyed." "Ha…" "ve…" "chil…" "dren…" "on…" "board." Up, get up. To the Northcliff. We'll pull in the rigging. Damn. They can't get through the surf. One boat made it! One boat for all of us, that's not a lot, is it? Prepare to launch! Lifeboat about to approach starboard side! Calling all stokers! Put out all fires in the engine room. This tub is sinking! Abandon ship! Come quick! They've all been saved. The children too, everybody. Where's the captain? Listen, you! Sometimes a beacon breaks down, doesn't it? It can happen in good faith. - Where's the ship's captain? - At the merchant's. We have to watch out or we're all done for, all of us. The beacon broke down, obviously. You can rely on us, on each of us. This wasn't just your doing. We all placed lanterns on the cliff. We're all guilty, all of us. Remove the lanterns from the cliff. I saw him. He's coming here. Who did you see? You're the captain, aren't you? Are you the lighthouse keeper? Yes. Have one of your men occupy the lighthouse, to prevent another tragedy like this. Can you tell me why the beacon isn't lit? I extinguished it at 11.56. - Are you insane? - I was hoping… that foodstuff would be washed up on our beach. Place this man under arrest. Take the rudder. We should be there by now. We should be, lad… but we're not. Once past the surf, there's land. Not a single light in sight. KG subs by Tim Cooper
