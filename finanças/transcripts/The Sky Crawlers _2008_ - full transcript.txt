Alert! There's an enemy plane coming up, quick, dodge! I'm hit. I'm out of control. I'm pulling out. Look out, that's the Teacher! I'm being tailed! Backup! Let me take the hit, Teacher! And who may you be? I'm Sasakura. I'm Kannami Yuuichi. Please guide me along. Is this the first time you've seen a female serviceman? Nope. I've seen others elsewhere too. Then that's good. And that's your plane. This won't do? The company will come and take this one back. Isn't it the same? If it's possible, I'd like not to change. When you fly it, you'll know. As well, this is the superior's order. Who was the original pilot of that plane? Why do you ask? Aren't there still some problems relating to the takeover? If you'd like to know go ask the superior. Please come in. I'm Kannami Yuuichi, assigned here from Japan. And I'm Kusanagi Suito. You arrived fast. I was expecting you to be late. Because the evening sun would be too glaring. Kannami? In Room 204, there's a man, your roommate, by the name of Tokino, you'll follow him to the skies tomorrow afternoon. Er... Excuse me. I'll get going. I'm Kannami, and I've just been assigned here today. I'm Yudagawa. He's Shinoda Uroyuki. How many pilots are there here? There are only three on duty as of now. Does it include you and him? From today onwards it's four people, including you. Only four? That's right, only four. And if we include the pretty Kusanagi-san in, it'd be five. So she has to fly too... Again playing till late night... Who are you? I'm Kannami. So it's you... I'm your roommate Tokino. I know, and I've seen the room too. Do you know that we're flying tomorrow too? I know that too. Then, let's get along well. Is this your first time? Over. The mission or this bird? Bird. I've been flying Sankas since I was one. Roger. Are you testing me? Now I know that you're not a chicken. The ground is clear and I'm running out of petrol, let's get some more. Roger. Look out! Three birds. Forward right. 10 o'clock. Are you alright? No damage. How many did you kill? 2 Planes. Beautiful! Welcome back. I'm back. Our casualties? Zero. And what about Lautern? They've stopped, and have no movement. I see. Good job. Then I'll get going. Eh, can I ask a question? Who was the previous pilot of my fighter plane? Kurita Jinrou. He was posted here seven months ago. He was attacked 63 times. He's skills were not bad. And where did he go? I have no comments for this question. And the reason of his transfer? Same. Did he die? Even if it was so, your current situation would still be the same. Whether you're here or not here, you can only live in these two conditions. When you takeover a fighter plane, don't you normally need some relation to the previous pilot first? Of course, this is a precondition when the pilot of the plane is alive only. That plane is new. From my judgment, there's no need to contact anyone. Do you have any opinions? None, that's the best plane. Anymore questions? Are you a Kildren? Do you still have questions? You smoke too. A superior who doesn't smoke is not trustable. And what is your basis? I've got no basis, it's only with reference to previous experiences. Experiences... Are you done asking? I'll get going. In such a short period of time, how did you take out two enemy planes? You're flattering me. I won't sweet-talk people. It's probably the enemy was a newbie. Are you modest? Yes. Where were you assigned to before you were assigned here? I don't know, I've already forgotten. Do you want to go out tonight? To where? To bring you around... ...you could say that it's my duty to. Where is this? The meat pie here is good. Are you hungry? At the end of the engagement, 3 of Lautern's twin engine fighter aircraft, "Rainbows" were down. And it is reported that two pilots were killed and another severely wounded. On the evening of October 5th, the situation of the Northern front of Europe, has apparently turn more favourable... We've been having the upper-hand lately. It's time that Lautern revives itself too. That news report was be talking about you guys right? Congratulations. I want a beer. And get him a meat pie and... Coffee. You wanted to bring me to this shop? This is the first stop. If you want to know in order... I'd like to tell him about his duties as pilot. Mama just glared at me. Mama? You should know that she prepares our planes for us too. Therefore she's called Mama. The second stop is arriving. Hi~ Naofumi. Hi~ This is our newcomer, Kannami Yuuichi. I'm Kusumi, nice to meet you. I'm Fuko. Nice to meet you. How's was it? How's was what? The meat pie. Not bad, seems like I've tried it before last time... I've already said it's alright... You've came here before too, a long time ago right? I'm not sure. Bye, Yuuichi. See you later. How's Suito-san? That scary Ojou-san. Is she doing fine? Let's go. Nice to meet you, boy! Not bad... For you to come here, means that Jinrou is dead. Who knows, I don't know Jinrou. Do you want to drink anything? If it's possible, I'd like coffee. What was that person like, that... Jinrou? He was kind. Just like you with that boyish face, he's smile was gentle. But it was as if he was suppressing something. It'd make people feel uneasy looking at him. I asked him, where'd he forgot his heart. Did he answer? He didn't answer me. But I feel that he left it in the skies, and felt that this wasn't too bad either. How long have you been here? Me? Are you referring to me? Note: In Japanese, kimi ( someone closer (in relationship or age) to yourself. How weird. There's only you and I here. You still use "I"... How childish... Note: In Japanese, boku (y younger people, such as children. I'm still a child. Say, do you like to fly in the skies? I do. That's good. Will you still come again? That's a promise. Welcome back. How was it? My whole body seems like it found feelings. There's no feeling that's disharmonious. It's nothing weird, for my skills are perfect. The previous pilot was called Jinrou right? Why did he die? Since the plane is still around, means that he couldn't have crashed. Quick go get some sleep. What's up? Seems like it's leaking oil. What's wrong? Seems like it's leaking oil. Where's Tokino? He should be coming soon. Find out what's the problem and write a report for me. Who are you, I've never seen you before. I'm Kannami, a pilot here. Kannami what? Yuuichi. I'm Kusanagi Mizuki. Kusanagi Suito's younger sister. Note: In Japanese, yoroshiku (you greet someone for the first time, and means both "Please guide me along" and "Pleased to meet you". Please guide me along, Yuuichi-kun. Nice to meet you too. Guide you along what? It's you who first said it. My yoroshiku meant that you be my friend, and to chat with me. Mine too. What would you like to drink? What are you doing here? It's school break, and I'm here to play. Though Onee-san doesn't allow me to come, but I still came. That's why in order not to obstruct Onee-san's work, I'm exploring by myself. Is there anything fun to play? Example? What do you normally do? Nothing much, nothing proud enough of to show off to you. Games and such? None. You're still a kid afterall. Yeah. Yuuichi-kun, are you a Kildren? That's right. Aren't you people who can never grow into adults? Why can't you become adults? It's not "can't be", it's "never be". Do you want to become an adult too? This... Right? Awesome! Don't look, your eyes will hurt. Let me- Excuse me, could you lend me a pair of welding glasses? She wants to see the light. Niki! Coming! Thank you. I can't see anything wearing this. This is dangerous, don't come close. Do you understand? Yes~ Well done. You came back late. Since we rarely go up to the skies, I did some investigation. That girl isn't her sister. What do you mean? It's her daughter. I've returned. You can delay the report. Roger. Sorry. Nevermind. I sometimes loathe myself when I see that kid. Why? Because that kid will catch up to me real fast. And what will happen after that? I've got a request. A tour will be coming. Can you follow them? Is it alright for me? Because I want to bring that kid back. I understand. It's time to go. I've heard that a tour will be coming. They came once before in the past. They're sponsors of our company or something, an organization who aids our company. What view do you have on such an activity? Activity? An arrangement such as people coming to tour here. I've got no comments. I'm sure you want to beat them up. That woman has long ago taken action. Who does "that woman" refer to. That woman on the second floor. Kusanagi? Why? Because her gun never leaves her. Have you ever heard of the story about Kurita Jinrou? What happened? That woman killed him. Why? See, the VIPs have arrived. This is our hanger. Does anyone want me to take a picture? Hello, how are you? Great, thank you. My whole family's a big fan of yours, we've always cheered for your team. Thank you very much. Is that your plane? Yes, it is. What is it like? What's what like? I mean, how does it feel to fly? Well, I don't know what to say. What about when you shoot down an enemy plane? I feel like a winner. Don't you put a kill mark on your plane? Some do, but I don't. It's just like a game. I know war is always horrible, you're fighting for a peaceful world. We really appreciate what you're doing for us. It's my job. Don't crash... Is it our company's pilot? The plane type is the same. It could have flown in from the neighbouring war zone. Someone... help him... Somebody... Enough is Enough! Totally not pitiful. Take no pity! Don't pity him to insult him! Calm down. It is disclose the identification of the downed aircraft as one of Rostocks' Sanka B fighters from the 502 Squadron, station at neighbouring district 202. ...but the details are not available yet. Subpoena? Summon who? No, I'm saying... Nevermind, when I'm done eating I'll rush back. I'm Kannami. Where are you? Driveaway. Sorry, I've got something to do, I'll hang up first. There are three Fortunes flying in your direction. Only two. No, three. Did you see them? Yes. How long more till they arrive? I'm afraid only five minutes. Since it's like that I still can take a breather. You should rush back soon. What about my plane? I'll fly it. I'll leave it to you. You're going back? Even if I rush back now, there'll be no plane for me to fly. Take care. What? Yuuichi! Yuuichi! Are you alright? I saw large scale fighter planes just flew past. The enemy has taken action long ago. Where's Naofumi? I don't know. Do you want to hitch a ride? I can't throw this down, because it's borrowed. Then we'll go first. Have all taken off? Your plane was the most troublesome, Kannami. She's flying now without a streamlined nosing, and there wasn't time to refuel, she could be running out of fuel now. Is Kusanagi-san the one flying? Yes. Naofumi, Naofumi~ It's better to ask those Onee-chans to go away first. When Kusanagi gets back she's bound to blow her top. Who blow what top? They said they got permission from Yuuichi. Yuuichi~ I know Tokino's safe, we'll be going back. Bye bye, Yuuichi! Don't do extra. Tokino's real slow. It's confirmed, he's safe. Because he was circling around her just now. Where did that guy land? It's me, connect me to the war zone command. Sorry, do you have any tobacco? It's me Kusanagi, connect me to the head. That's enough, quick call the head over. You could say it was a miracle. The loss wasn't too big, because the enemy made a mistake. Why were we late in being informed? This doesn't count as a reason, I'm coming over right now. Yudagawa! Before I come back, could you sit at the office upstairs? There could be a need to contact you in case of emergency. No problem if I can drink while waiting. Of course, Kannami, come with me. You're driving too fast. I'm sorry, this is caused by my feelings. That's Tokino... As expected he went to loaf while on the way back. The straight road beside the Driveway, is suitable for emergency landings. He went to drink coffee to skive. For you to make a special trip to pick us up, thank you very much. It's been a long time since we last met. And that's to say you're not letting us in? How weird, it doesn't seem to be damaged by the typhoon on one look. He's my subordinate. Because I'm afraid that I'd lose too much physical energy here, therefore if in that case, I'll get him to drive. I see... So you're the... The head is out. When I go to his room I'll know whether he's out or not. For you to make a special trip to here, we already know that the state of events are very serious. Which is to say we already understand your feelings. Don't misunderstand. I only wish to see the face of the person who wanted to have me dead. Seriously, be a bit more mature. It's because of this I can't stand kids. I'm sorry. No, you're totally correct. But for people who may just die tomorrow, is there a need for them to become adults? Turn right infront. As well as bypass a place. Contact? I see. Then it's alright, go get some rest. Thank you. Where is this? You could say that this is a guest room. The employees have the right to use it, so from time to time it will be in use. Though no one will come for a second visit. Does that mean that everybody, together with Kusanagi-san yourself, have came here at least once? It's rarely that two people come here together. Why? Are you hungry? Though there's only frozen food, I'll make something to eat. You still got the appetite. Why do you ask? Because this is really hard to eat. But this is made of edible ingredients right? Do you want to go back? I don't mind staying here. Did Jinrou stay here too? Why do you ask? Yudagawa-san said some weird things, that you killed Jinrou. Could it be that... You want me to kill you too? Fuel will still last five minutes. Let's go home, turn right to one-six-zero, maintain this height. Look out! Enemy at 2 O'clock , 2 bombers. They got escorts. Fire? One is moving forward, looks like Sky Lee Are you sure? Wanna bet? I'll check it out. You head home. By yourself? No way, come back Westy! Westy come in, where are you? It's Sky Lee, there's a black leopard on the plane. It's the Teacher! Westy, are you alright? Where are you? Come in, answer me! Yudagawa is the Teacher? You can go. On the sea, within a moment, he sinked. Did you see? Sky Lee has never appeared in this war zone before. Yudagawa wants to confirm with you whether the plane you saw was Teacher or not. Teacher, you say? If you meet him in the skies, you'd never come back alive. It's said that he's Lautern's best pilot. As recently it's always been our side leading, so that might the reason he was send here from another war district. It's possible. Teacher... It's just a rumour, that guy is different from us, I heard he was an adult. Can adults be fighter pilots? Yea, an adult male. Male adult... Contact? No response. I did asked her to get back quick, The clouds are moving weirdly, and the fuel is running out, she agreed too. Why then? She targeted a far away enemy plane and then left the formation. Until now she hasn't come back, maybe... Don't drink, once the weather gets better, we might do a search. That is the Teacher? The one with the Black Leopard design? If I could see that design at such a distance, I'll also stay on. Why is she so concerned about the Teacher? Ask her when she comes back. Then we will have to see if she makes it back. Make way. Call a doctor, call an ambulance! Get the towel! It looks like she crashed near my house. Thank you. That look on her face, I have seen it before. Huh? It reflects the feelings of here. She came to my house before, to see my guest. She chased me out, after a few hours she still hasn't come out. That person, is very dangerous. What are you guys looking at? Get out. Got a cigarette? Sorry I gave you guys so much trouble. Help me tell this to everyone. She only lost consciousness, her bones and internal organs look fine. Let her get some sleep before the doctor gets here. I heard there was a large scale plan, our pilots might be mobilized. Mobilized? Though it was on impulse, but originally I had wanted to leave the war district, then I made the decision. Sasakura-san has been in contact Kusanagi-san for how long? And what about that? The girl called Mizuki, who's Kusanagi-san's daughter, could her Father be... Before the doctor arrives, let me be with her. You go get some rest. It doesn't matter if you reach the ends of Earth, it's still the same guy in front of your eyes. Really. Recently I've not seen any guys who'd really open my eyes. Aren't twins who are both pilots rare? I've seen some in the past. But I've never seen any whereby one couldn't get back alive. What are your doing? This is meant for kids to ride. I'm still a kid afterall. Is that guy Kannami still at the meeting place? I don't think he's there anymore. Then in the room? Probably still hasn't gone back. Could it be you? You guessed right. Why didn't you tell me from the start? Because you never asked. You're totally different from my imagination. I'm Tokino. Am I totally different too? I'm Mitsuya, please guide me along. Nice to meet you. I can't wait for tomorrow. What's the background of that woman? She's really excellent. What? The woman yesterday. Heard that she's on of the best. To be a female best isn't easy. I feel that a male best isn't easy too. It doesn't matter what a guy is anyway. Aren't you our best too? Kusanagi seems to be quite good herself too. Just really wished that the two of you could get along better. But, it's better for you to be yourself as there's much for freedom. What? I'm saying that just do as you like. Everybody, today afternoon you all will be attending a historical war planning. The aim is the central war district, where Lautern's stronghold is. Firstly, all eight planes of yours will take off from this base. And after that, all planes from other bases will gradually gather. Till the eventual place, we'll have about eighty planes. Apart from this, there'll be thirty medium-sized bombers and another twenty heavy-duty bombers at a higher altitude. And this will make up the B team. The forty fighter planes and fifty land-assault planes will make up the A team. They'll be attacking the front-line base before earlier than you guys. Any questions? Can I ask this question totally unrelated to war? Go ahead. Will tonight's party be stopped? Are we still holding it? Those kids nearby will come and play once every two months, which is tonight. I'm sorry, I originally didn't know, it won't be stopped, the war is to be done in secrecy. Now you cannot issue the order to stop. Kusanagi-kun, do you have any thing to add on? I'm afraid that it'd be war over the seas. When my forces attack the front line, the enemy definitely will take action. If our allies's planes fly around, then we'd be unable to aim the shells at the sky. Even if in reluctance, it must still be continued. To the fighter planes, it'd be a rare long distance attack mission. For the short distanced Sanka group, you'd have to take mid-air refuels. Let go of the external fuselage only as the last resort. The end. Then, in twenty minutes, gather at the runway. Rostock, contract company for the European Confederation, begin long range raids against strategic points of its opponent, Lautern. And it's expected that more large scale engagements would ensue. The strength of the attacking force is, according to the statement by Rostock, 3 squadrons of heavy bombers, from the strategic bombing wing, escorted by fighters of 8 squadrons and 4 tactical squadrons. Flight control to planes, 6000 to target point 1, Estimated time 1000 minus 05 Repeat, 1000 minus 05 To all squadron leaders, Stay on your altitude. Whale, flying out of airspace. Warning! Enemy is in sight, altitude 8000, fight at contact, engage at will. All weapons free, let's dance! Control to everyone, evacuate battle area. Repeat, evacuate battle area. Cairn, where're you? Altitude 3000, turning left to join. Perfect, turn your tail some more, side drift. Where's Sukabi? No idea. Sukabi, come in, this is Cairn. I got no answer. Mission complete, repeat, return to base everyone. Rostock's offensive that started at 10 o'clock this morning met with an unexpectedly fierce and effective interception from Lautern. In the turmoil and confusion, inflicting heavy casualties to both sides, Engagement seemed to be halted, as the recommendation has been hastily issued by the European Confederation We will report the figures of losses and casualties from both companies as soon as the Conflict Control Committee... Superior, where are you? Superior! The vigor of the enemy has taken a huge hit, I saw the moment of the crash. Which one? Sky Lee was coming up from the coastal marsh, it had almost hit the rear of it. At that point it did a mid-air loop halfway and as it was going up it suddenly lost speed and started falling. And from the back Kuma Take raced up to it's assitance, with a turn just like that, And from the side it covered the opponent. It was very close. I'm afraid that Shinoda who was flying a Sanka, was also done in with such a similar method. It was that plane with the Black Leopard design. When we're done, let's go experience this unfamiliar city. Isn't there even a hotel here? Let's go take a look when we're at the end. How early they close, it's only this time. This city is really orderly. Look, can you see that? What a coincidence. Bowling? Maybe we can get some beer there. What a pity! Try to get a spare! What does that count as... Tokino. Kannami it's your turn. I'll get going first. Seeing those bitches together makes me really want to throw the ball over. Do you still want to play? I heard that there's not a bad place around here from the receptionist, let's go get more drinks. I already can't drink. Then let me drink. Why were you so reckless the last time? Because that plane had the Black Leopard design on it. He used to be from our company. Our? You say it very politely. Because he was my superior. As a pilot he was outstanding. He was a normal adult. Male adult. Why did he want to go over to the other company? As many things happened, that's why he left our company. After Teacher crashed, has there been any changes? Such as destiny, or limits that kind of stuff. True to say... But no one could crash him. Why? Who do you think our enemy are? I don't know, and I've never thought about it. It's obvious we're just killing each other. This is work. No matter what occupation, it's still the same. Elbow out your competitor and the one who gains is the winner. In comparison to other normal enterprises, what we're doing is nothing more than playing an inefficient old game. That's right, as it's only just a game, that's why we can legitimately kill people and get killed. What an interesting way of thinking. Interesting? No matter in what era, war has never been completely eradicated. To humans, such taste of reality is very important at any point of time. During the same ear, there's somebody out there now in a war with a sense of reality. It's something that cannot be short of in the human society. And this definitely cannot be faked. To understand what war is, to rely on what's archived in history books is definitely not enough. For someone to really get killed and for a report to come out, not to let humans see the cruelty peace will not prevail. Even the meaning of peace may not be understandable. It's the same, like if we're not in the sky killing each other, then we'd not have the sense of survival. And since our war is a game that cannot be ended, then we'll need rules. Such as an enemy that we can never win, which is... Teacher. You've had too much of a drink. What are you looking at? Do you want me to kill you? Or are you willing to kill me? If not we'll never be able to get away. Only two planes are returning. Today is the start of the training with the Someaka squadron? That engine has a problem. Rokuta, Haga and Nikki have experience with twin-engine type planes. Wait, mister... Yes? That child is? Kusanagi-san's daughter. Daughter? Who's daughter? There are a lot of different rumours about that. Who're you? I'm a pilot that just reported for duty here. I'm Kannami. I'm Aihara. How many pilots are there here? There're 7 inclusive of you and Kusanagi. Is it? What is it? Its nothing, I kind of remember someone folding the newspaper like that. Is it? Sasakura-san Yes? How long have you been with Kusanagai-san? I can't remember, maybe 8 years? Then you should know about the days when she was an ace pilot. Mostly. The way she is now, is that good? The way she is now... meaning? That person, has no more hope. From what I think, she being qualified for this job... That person gave birth to a kid. So? A kid gave birth to a kid. So? You still don't get it? Nope. Everyone is acting dumb, pretending that they don't know anything. The company and the children, you all know it very well. Kusanagi is... She is an excellent ace pilot. She was never shot in battle, lasting a bit longer than her comrades. It's because of experience, She learned how to intervene in the fate of herself and others, Killing her love one, is that intervention? Don't you get it? No! I'm going out, Kannami Going over to Kusumi's place? Yea. Send my regards to Fuko. Who is that? Who is who? The person you have an appointment with tonight. If it's Kusanagi-san, its best you give it up. Don't tell me it's Mitsuya-san. If its her, it would be best to think twice. I'm saying this for your good. Why are they dangerous? Isn't it obvious, try sleeping with Kusanagi-san, she will place a bullet in your head, and off you go to heaven. What about Mitsuya? Something like an inescapable living hell. Anything else you want to say? I won't bow down my head and beg you, this is a friend's heartfelt advice, be careful tonight. Thank you. Please enter. Sorry for disturbing. There's only coffee here, if you want, there's some in the pot on the table. That's great, and I thought you were out. Tokino is out. Went out to play with mature girls? Yes. Why didn't you go too? I had a premonition. The premonition of me coming to find you? I am not so conceited, I had a feeling that it would be better if I stayed in the room tonight, and it was quite accurate. How long has it been when you came here, when you were posted to this base, Kannami? I can't remember. Since the end of summer I guess. Then what about before, who long was your flying time? How long have you been a fighter pilot? Did you come here to ask me this sort of questions? You're the most trustworthy person on this base, so I asked you. How do you guys sort out your feelings? Keep on repeating the past and present of a certain memory, how do you link them up? This is just my imagination, you guys are perhaps forgetful. Its just like a dream, the vague, blur feelings protect the spirit. The things of yesterday, last month, last year, have no difference, its all treated as one same thing. Am I wrong? If you're talking about me, you're mostly correct, I've been like this since young, all blurry, I don't know if I should wake here or sleep there, I'm often labeled as such, I don't even get it. Did you know Kildren is our company's product name? In midst of the development of genetic factor control agents, You guys were born. We wanted to use that as the name of the new medicine, but it became the name of you guys. You've said that before right? You guys, Kildren won't grow old in age, you can live on forever. At first, no one know about this, even if they know, they don't believe it, But rumors spread out gradually, saying "There're humans who can't die unless they are killed in battle" I don't understand, am I also one of Kildren? The things I'm telling you now, where did I hear them from, from what book did I read about it? Is it true? It feels that... All this are like shattered pieces, Even having no confidence to say that I have experienced it before myself, No clue at all. I'm the only one that is not Kildren, There is no such cheap things right? When did I started piloting fighter planes? When did I start killing people? What am I doing this for? When did I become like that? Every night I would try to recall. I can't recall, I can't recall. No matter how hard I try to recall, recall, I can't recall anything from my childhood other than the practice scenes. Even though I like playing with kids in the past, At the previous base, I got to know some sponsors, They only provided the venue and sponsorship. I like watching kids, thinking that if I still had my youth, it would be a wonderful thing. Because I might be born just like them. Thinking of it, I might not grow up, just like the feet not being able to touch the ground anymore. Don't you feel it? Don't you feel uneasy? Kusanagi shot Jinrou, it might be to help him end his pain, don't you think so? But he didn't die. Didn't die? He became you, he was given a chance to live as another person. He was implanted with a new memory, and so you were created. You're the reincarnation of Jinrou, if not, his skills as a fighter pilot will vanish, losing the functions of a weapon. Why didn't anybody realize that? They're just pretending to not know. Before you realize it, you're just pretending you don't know Your imagination sure is vivid. How's the coffee? It's nice thank you. I've also heard some interesting things, thank you. What's the reason? It's best if you keep the gun, or lend it to me. This is my gun. Then lend it to me. Why? Let me kill Kusanagi in your place. Good idea. Mitsuya, leave the room. If you want to die, go on ahead. Can I smoke a cigarette? Go on, this is your room anyway. Did you kill Kurita Jinrou? Yeah. Did he tell you to kill him? Yeah. Do you love him? Yeah. Deeply in love. Shoot me with that gun. You want me to kill you? Yes, it's your turn to kill me now. Please. You must continue living, before you want to change anything. Even if I've walked such a long road, will I be able to step into the unknown? It's because I've walked this path countless times, that the scenery keeps on changing. Is this still not enough? Is it just because of this, that it is not fulfilling enough? Warning!
