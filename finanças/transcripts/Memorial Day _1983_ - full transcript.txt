- NORMALLY, IN A SITUATION OF A COLLAPSE, YOU FIND THE FAILURE AT THE BASE. HERE, WE FOUND THE FAILURE AT THE TOP. - [whistles] HOW UNUSUAL WAS THAT? - WELL, IT'’S NOT UNHEARD OF. THE TOP FLOOR SHEERED OFF AND FELL ON THE ONE BELOW IT. AND THOSE TWO COLLAPSED ON THE NEXT FLOOR, AND THOSE THREE ONTO THE NEXT, AND SO FORTH. THIS IS WHERE TWO OF THE DEAD BODIES WERE FOUND, AND TWO OTHERS HERE. NOW, WE CAN PINPOINT WHERE THE SHEAR ACTUALLY OCCURRED. WE CAN TELL YOU THE PRECISE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED AFTER THE BREAK. OF COURSE, AS ATTORNEYS, YOU GENTLEMEN ARE PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN THE CAUSE OF THESE EVENTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY... - THIS IS WHERE WE EARN OUR FEE. - WE ARE UNABLE TO TELL YOU WHY IT HAPPENED EXACTLY. WHAT WE HAVE DONE--WOULD YOU THE LIGHTS, PLEASE? WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS ANALYZE THE DESIGN, THE CONSTRUCTION METHODS, AND THE MATERIALS. AND WE ARE READY TO DISCUSS PROBABILITIES WITH YOU. - GENTLEMEN, I MAY BE JUMPING AHEAD HERE, BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CLEAR INDICATION OF WHY IT HAPPENED, IS THERE ROOM HERE FOR A FINDING THAT IS CAUSED AS AN ACT OF GOD? IT WOULD HELP OUR CLIENT. - MR. FRENCH, AS FAR AS I'’M CONCERNED, GOD HASN'’T BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THESE THINGS SINCE THE BATTLE OF JERICHO. - [chuckles] ALL THAT MONEY, AND ALL THOSE EXPERTS, AND THE ANSWER IS, "I DON'’T KNOW." - [laughs] IT COULD'’VE BEEN WORSE. THEY COULD'’VE SAID IT WAS RUSKIN'’S FAULT. - BARNEY WOULD'’VE FOUND A WAY OUT. ACT OF GOD. YOU WANNA HIT SOME. - NO, THANKS. I GOT A DATE. YOU FINISH YOUR MEMO YET? - NO, NOT YET. - WELL, BAD WRIST, BOY. THAT'’S WHY YOU DON'T GET ANY TOP SPIN. - I'’LL SHOW YOU TOP SPIN. - CAREFUL, WILL YA? I HAVEN'’T PAID FOR THIS THING YET. - THAT'’S PRETTY. - [chuckles] - YES. - I'’D LIKE A ROOM NUMBER FOR A JORDAN BANKS. - WELL, LET ME CHECK FOR YOU RIGHT HERE. YES. IS HE EXPECTING YOU? - YES. - LET ME RING HIM FOR YOU. YES, MR. BANKS, YOU HAVE A VISITOR IN THE LOBBY BY THE NAME OF... - WALKER. - MR. WALKER. THANK YOU. I'’LL SEND HIM RIGHT OVER. - JORDY? BANKS, YOU HERE? JORDY? BAM! - [yells] - UNCLE, UNCLE! YOU EGG-SUCKING PAL. - RELAX, JORDY. - YEAH, IT'’S GOOD TO SEE YA. - CIGARETTE GAVE IT AWAY, PAL. - HEY, LOOK AT YOU. HEY, YOU GOT TALL. - COMBAT BOOTS. - YOU AIN'’T LOST A DAY. [both laugh] GOOD TO SEE YA. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE DRINK, HUH? - I'’M UP FOR THAT. - OKAY. I'’LL GET THE BOTTLE. GET THE GLASSES INSIDE. - IN WHERE? - THE BATHROOM. - WHICH DOOR? - ON THE LEFT. - OKAY. [chuckles] YOU KEEP TRYING, DON'’T YA? - HEY. - [chuckles] [shouting] - WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? [shouting] - OW! UNCLE, UNCLE! GIBBY! - WALKS! WHOA! - AIN'’T GOT IT ANYMORE. - HOW YA DOING? - YOU DIDN'’T TELL ME THIS GUY WAS GONNA BE HERE. - HEY, HE'’S GOTTEN SOFT, AIN'’T HE, KID. FELL FOR THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK. - CLOSE YOUR EYES. COME ON. - WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS? CLOSE MY EYES? [all talking at once] - WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. TRUST ME. CLOSE '’EM. - WHAT IS THIS? GIBB, WHAT IS IT? - YOU'’LL SEE. - OKAY, OPEN YOUR EYES. - TA-DA! - [chuckles] - RAUL? - HEY, SARGE. - OH, I DON'’T BELIEVE IT! - HEY, YOU'’D BETTER. YOU'’RE LOOKING AT THE REAL THING. - WHERE'’D YOU FIND THESE GUYS? - WELL, I GOT MONROE THROUGH THE VA, AND THIS CLOWN, I FIND IN A BAR, DRUNK OUT OF HIS MIND, RIGHT? ACTUALLY, HE'’S LOOKING FOR A FIGHT. YOU WANNA STEP IN AND SAVE HIM FROM GETTING HIS BUTT KICKED BY THE BOUNCER. - YEAH, ONCE A GRUNT, ALWAYS A GRUNT. - ALWAYS. - YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY TOLD ME 12 YEARS AGO WE'’D ALL BE IN THIS ROOM TODAY, I'’D TELL '’EM THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR DAMN MIND. - HEY, I'’M INTO THAT, BROTHER. YO. SURVIVAL. - SURVIVAL. - SURVIVAL NOTHING. LET'’S OPEN THE DAMN THING. [all talking at once] - ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME SOME ORDY, WALKER. COME ON, BABY. COME ON. WHERE THE HELL'’S THE DAMN ORDY? [all talking at once] - WAIT A SECOND. I HEAR IT. I HEAR IT. IT'’S A MONROE'S COBRA. IT'’S MONROE'S COBRA. IT'’S COMING IN. COME ON, MONROE. COME ON, BABY. COME ON, MONROE. - HEY! MY, MAN. MY, MAN. GOOD SHOT. GIVE '’EM HELL, BABY. RIGHT ON. - WHOA. WHOA. WHOA. WALTER'’S GOT A WATER BUFFALO. - WAS A COMMUNIST. - A COMMUNIST. - HEY, WATER BUFFALO. WHO WAS THAT GUY THAT GOT BUSTED FOR SHOOTING THE WATER BUFFALO? - OH, BRIGGS. - CAPTAIN BRIGGS. - BRIGGS. DAMN. I HAVEN'’T THOUGHT ABOUT BRIGGS SINCE--WHAT'’S HE DOING NOW? - BRIGGS, YEAH. HE GOT IT OVER THERE, MAN. - BRIGGS? NO. - WHAT'’S THE NAME OF THAT LITTLE VILLAGE BRIGGS GOT IT? - I DON'’T REMEMBER THE NAME. - YEAH. - THAT'’S STRANGE. I DON'’T REMEMBER ANY OF THAT. IT'’S FUNNY, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'’S WAY BACK THERE IN THE FOG. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOME LITTLE THING HAPPENS, AND IT JUST POPS UP. - HOI AM. - WHAT DID YOU SAY? - WHAT WAS THE NAME? THAT WAS THE PLACE BRIGGS GOT IT. - YEAH, THAT'’S RIGHT. - UH-HUH. THAT'’S RIGHT. - SAME PLACE BULL GOT IT. - UH-UH. NO, GIBBY. NO. NO. BULL GOT IT AT THE FIRE BASE. - NO. NO. I MEAN THE SAME PLACE. YOU KNOW, RIGHT ABOVE THE EAR. A NEAT LITTLE HOLE RIGHT ABOVE THE EAR. HAD THE SAME DAMN EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE TOO. - OH, GIBBS, THAT'’S COLD. - GENTLEMEN, IT'’S LATE. MAY I SUGGEST THE BAR? - JUST ONE MORE DANCE, COLONEL? - YOU KNOW, COLONEL, WE'’RE JUST GOING HOME AND CRAWLING IN BED, RIGHT? - HEY, GIB, YOU ALWAYS USED TO CARRY AROUND A PICTURE OF YOUR WIFE AND WHAT, SON, AND DAUGHTER? - SON, YEAH. WE GOT DIVORCED A FEW YEARS AGO. - OH, I'’M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. YOU STILL SEE THE BOY. - NOT MUCH. MARSHAL WAS LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER. - [snores] - ONLY GUY I EVER KNEW WHO COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIST FIGHT. - [chuckles] - YEAH, IT IS GETTING KIND OF LATE. I WAS SUPPOSED TO READ A REPORT TONIGHT. - HEY, WALKS, IT WAS REALLY GREAT SEEING YOU GUYS. - YEAH, IT WAS. - MY MAN. EVERYBODY SEEMS LIKE THEY'’RE DOING GREAT, EVEN MONROE. YOU REMEMBER THE WAY MONROE LOOKED THAT NIGHT. - YEAH. - IT LOOKS LIKE I'’M THE ONLY MISFIT IN THE BUNCH. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - AH, I MEAN YOU GUYS ALL GOT GOOD JOBS, NOT JUST JOBS. YOU'’RE ALL, YOU KNOW, REGULAR PEOPLE. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, GIBBS? - WALKS, I HAVEN'’T WORKED FOR SIX MONTHS. - YEAH? WHAT'’D YOU DO, RETIRE? - NO. MY LAST JOB WAS PUMPING GAS. EVERY TIME SOME OLD GUY DROVE IN THERE, IN A BIG OLD HOG OF A CAR, I'’D BE STANDING THERE PUTTING GAS IN THAT GUY'’S TANK. AND I'’D BE THINKING, "THAT GUY'’S GOT MONEY. "HE'’S ONE OF THEM. "HE SENT ME OVER TO '’NAM. HE LET IT HAPPEN." AND I'’D BE STANDING THERE WITH A HOSE IN MY HAND. I FELT LIKE PUTTING A TORCH TO IT, WALKS. JUST DROP A MATCH AND WATCH THAT BIG SUCKER SMOKE. - HEY, EASY. EASY. LISTEN, MY FRIEND. IT'’S BEEN GOOD. - HEY, WALKS, WALKS. YOU EVER DO SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, CHANGED YOU? LIKE, DRAWING A LINE IN THE DIRT AND STEPPING OVER IT? AND PRETTY SOON, YOU'’VE GONE SO FOR FROM WHERE YOU'’VE STARTED, AND YOU LOOK BACK, AND YOU SAY, "THAT WAS ONE PERSON ON ONE SIDE OF THE LINE, "ANOTHER PERSON ON THE OTHER. WHICH ONE IS ME?" - I DON'’T UNDERSTAND YOU, JIM. - REMEMBER DECKER, THE BIG CAPTAIN DECKER? YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD ME ONCE? HE SAID, "YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS JUST WORK." IT'’S ALL IT WAS. YOU COULD EITHER DO IT WELL, OR YOU COULD SCREW IT UP. YOU JUST GOTTA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BOSS WANTED. I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BOSS WANTS?" AND DECKER SAYS, "DEATH, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE." - GIBBS. - HEY, WALKS. YOU DIDN'’T KNOW HIM LIKE I DID. THAT GUY WAS NUTS. HE TOOK PLEASURE IN GIVING ME THE WORST HE COULD. - NOW WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? - BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I DIDN'’T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR IT. BODY COUNTS WAS HIS THING. HE LOVED IT WHEN THEY WERE ALL BLOWN APART '’CAUSE THEN, YOU COULDN'’T TELL HOW MANY THERE WERE. DECKER ALWAYS ESTIMATED ON THE HIGH SIDE. - OH, MAN. HEY, JORDY, THANKS FOR THE PARTY, PAL. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. - [clears throat] HEY, WALKS. WALKS, YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT AT THE FIRE BASE WHEN THEY CUT THE WIRE AND CAME THROUGH THE NIGHT BULL GUY? - YEAH. - THE NEXT MORNING, DECKER SENT ME OUT TO GATHER UP THE BODIES, MAKE THE COUNT. INVENTORY, HE CALLED IT. BUT THERE WASN'’T ANY BODIES. IT WAS JUST PARTS. IT WAS LIKE WALKING THROUGH A JUNKYARD, WALKS. A HUMAN JUNKYARD. - GIBBS, I DON'’T THINK IT DOES ANY GOOD TO TALK ABOUT IT. - YEAH. - I GOTTA GET SOME AIR. - I'’LL COME WITH YOU. - YOU DID WHAT YOU DID BECAUSE YOU HAD TO. IF YOU HADN'’T, YOU WOULDN'’T HAVE SURVIVED. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. - THAT'’S THE CRAZY PART. YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST BE ANOTHER PERSON '’CAUSE A LITTLE TIME GOES BY, AND YOU'’RE IN ANOTHER PLACE. THAT'’S COMPLETELY CRAZY. - THE WHOLE THING WAS A LITTLE CRAZY. - YOU WEREN'’T CRAZY, WALKS. BRIGGS WAS AND DECKER WAS. BUT YOU WEREN'’T. THAT'’S WHY I ASKED DECKER TO PUT ME IN YOUR SQUAD, '’CAUSE YOUR SQUAD WAS THE BEST. REALLY, WALKER, I MEAN IT. - '’CAUSE I HAD GOOD PEOPLE. - YEAH, YEAH. BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT. YOU HAD ALL THE GUYS LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER. YOU HAD EVERYBODY PULLING TOGETHER. YOU WOULDN'’T TAKE ANY CRAP FROM DECKER. IF IT DIDN'’T MAKE SENSE, YOU WOULDN'’T DO IT BECAUSE YOU KNEW. YOU KNEW THE WHOLE THING WAS SO DAMN STUPID. - YEAH, I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO. THAT'’S ALL ANYBODY DID. - WE USED TO GO OUT ON AMBUSH WITH BRIGGS. BEFORE I WENT TO YOUR SQUAD, DECKER WOULD COME ALONG. HE DIDN'’T HAVE TO. HE WANTED TO JUST SO HE COULD GET HIS INVENTORY. BUT YOU TRIED TO AVOID IT, MAN. '’CAUSE YOU KNEW. [cries] YOU KNEW THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST--IT WAS JUST STUPID BUTCHERING, MAN! WHOSE FAULT WAS IT, WALKS? - WHOSE FAULT WAS WHAT? - THE WHOLE THING! - I DON'’T KNOW, GIBBS. I DON'’T THINK ABOUT IT. - YOU SEE? THAT'’S WHAT I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME. WHOSE FAULT WAS IT? WAS IT JUST A BUNCH OF LAME-BRAINED POLITICIANS OR SOME BIG CORPORATIONS? OR THAT OLD GUY IN A FANCY CAR? [cries] IF I COULD FIGURE OUT WHOSE FAULT IT WAS, I'’D GO UP TO THAT BASTARD, AND I'’D STICK HIS NOSE IN IT JUST LIKE HE STUCK MINE! - GIBBS, YOU REALLY OUGHT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. - I'’M TALKING TO YOU, WALKS. - TALK TO A PSYCHIATRIST OR SOMETHING. - I TALKED TO A SHRINK ONCE. I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING OFF THE DEEP END. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT? MY FATHER. HOW DID I RELATE TO MY FATHER? I'’M REALLY SCREWED UP. RIGHT, WALKS? - NO, MAN. YOU'’RE JUST WORKING IT OVER AND OVER IN YOUR HEAD. IT'’S NOT GONNA DO ANY GOOD. - [cries] OH, BOY. DON'’T YOU THINK ABOUT IT WALKS, HUH? YOU AND MONROE AND BANKS? DON'’T YOU THINK ABOUT IT? AM I THE ONLY ONE? - IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. - YEAH. BUT DON'’T YOU THINK ABOUT IT? - NOT IF I CAN HELP IT. - HEY, WALKS! GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. - SURE YOU WILL, GIBBS. SURE YOU WILL. - REMEMBER THOSE KIDS, WALKS? - YEAH. - REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE PLACE? - NO, I DON'’T THINK I DO. - BIN MAU. I'’LL NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS I LIVE. IT'’S RIGHT OVER THERE. - WHAT IS? - BIN MAU. IT ACTUALLY EXISTS. YOU COULD PUT YOUR BOAT IN RIGHT HERE. YOU COULD SAIL THERE IF YOU WANTED TO. THE WHOLE THING WAS REAL. [cries] - HI. - HI. - WHAT TIME IS IT? - IT'’S LATE. GO BACK TO BED. - HOW WAS YOUR FRIEND? - FINE. - WAS IT JUST THE TWO OF YOU? - NO. THERE WERE TWO OTHER GUYS FROM OUR UNIT. - WHAT'’D YOU TALK ABOUT? - THE GOOD OLD DAYS. - WELL, I WISH I'’D BEEN A FLY ON THE WALL. - YEAH, WHY? - '’CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I'’LL EVER HEAR ABOUT IT. - MMM. - OKAY. TELL ME THE TRUTH. DO YOU HAVE A MISTRESS? SOMEONE YOU TELL YOUR DEEP, DARK SECRETS TO? - YEAH. - YOU'’D BETTER NOT. - GO BACK TO BED. I HAVE TO GET THIS REPORT READY. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MOM? - I'’M STARTING MY CLINICAL WORK TODAY, JIMMY. - YOU'’RE GOING TO TALK TO CHILDREN? - MM-HMM. ALL DAY. - WE'’RE CHILDREN. - DON'’T I TALK TO YOU? - NOT ALL DAY. - [whistles] LOOK AT YOU. - TELL ME. DO I LOOK PROFESSIONAL FOR THIS THING TODAY? - YOU DO TO ME, BUT THEN AGAIN, I'’M NOT A DEPRESSED 7-YEAR-OLD. YOU GONNA BE LATE? - WELL, I DON'’T KNOW, HONEY. I HAVE A MEETING WITH DR. CLIPSTEIN. HOW ABOUT YOU? ANY PLANS? - TENNIS. - HEY, I THINK RITA CAN STAY LATE. OOH, LISTEN. WOULD YOU ASK MATT WHAT TIME ON FRIDAY? - WHAT'’S FRIDAY? - GAY'’S BIRTHDAY PARTY? - UH-HUH. OKAY. - CAN YOU DROP THE KIDS OFF? - SURE. - OKAY, THANKS. NOW, YOU TWO HAVE A GREAT DAY, AND WISH ME LUCK. - YOU'’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO WISH A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST LUCK, ARE YOU? - BYE, MOM. - NO, IT'’S OKAY ON YOUR FIRST DAY. - JAMIE, DID YOU JUST PUT YOUR BUTTERFLY IN YOUR CEREAL? - I WANTED TO SEE IF IT WOULD FLOAT. - TAKE IT OUT, OKAY? - OKAY. - FOR THE BILLET STEEL BARS, IF THEY'’RE CORRECT, THE THING SHOULD NOT HAVE SHEARED. - EXCELLENT WORK, MATT. - OH, THANK YOU, BARNEY. - UH, NED, I MUST HAVE MISPLACED YOUR MEMO. - OH, IT'’S ON THE WAY, BARNEY. - NED SENDS HIS MEMO BY THE SCENIC ROUTE. - GOOD MORNING, WATNEY. - LET'’S BEGIN. I'’M DUE IN COURT AT 11:30. [phone rings] - JENNY, I HAVE TOLD YOU TO HOLD THE CALLS. ALL RIGHT, BUT NOTHING AFTER THIS. IT'’S FOR YOU, MATT. JENNY SAYS IT'’S URGENT. - YES? GIBBY? GIBBY, I CAN'’T TALK TO YOU NOW. I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK. NO, GIBB, I'’M IN A MEETING. I CAN'’T TALK NOW. I WILL. YES, I WILL. OKAY. I'’M SORRY. - HI. - HI. - WHO WAS THAT? - OH, I WAS TRYING TO REACH ONE OF THE GUYS FROM LAST NIGHT. - WHICH ONE? - YOU DON'’T KNOW HIM. - WELL, SEE, IF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT HIM, I WOULD. THAT'’S HOW THAT WORKS. - YEAH. - SOMETIMES, I THINK YOU ARE DESCENDED FROM A LONG LINE OF CLAMS. - HOW'’D IT GO TODAY. - OH, I DON'’T KNOW. IT WAS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT. A LOT OF SAD KIDS IN ONE PLACE. - I TOLD YOU. - YOU TOLD ME WHAT? - YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT. - I DIDN'’T SAY I DIDN'’T LIKE IT. OH. HOLD ME FOR A MINUTE, WOULD YA? - MAKE YOU SAD? - NO, NOT REALLY. THEY SEEM LIKE SUCH SWEET KIDS. I HAD THE FEELING THEY MIGHT NEED SOMEONE LIKE ME. UNLIKE A CERTAIN MOLLUSK I LIVE WITH. - INFORMATION. - YES, OPERATOR, DO YOU HAVE A LISTING FOR A THOMAS GIBBS, G-I-DOUBLE-B-S? - JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. - THANK YOU. - I HAVE A T. GIBBS AT 555-4817. - YES. THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS FOR THAT? - 921 PUBLIC LANE. - 921? - THAT'’S CORRECT. - GREAT. THANKS VERY MUCH. - YOU'’RE WELCOME. - GIBBY? GIBBY? HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? GIBBY! GIBBY! GIBBY! GIBBY, MAN. YOU DEAF? OH, GIBBY, GIBBY, GIBBY, GIBBY. NO, I HAVEN'’T BEEN ABLE TO REACH HIM. HE DIDN'’T ANSWER HIS PHONE. SO I CAME ON OUT. - HAD YOU SEEN HIM LATELY? - JUST THE ONCE. I'’D KNOWN HIM IN THE MARINE CORPS, BUT I HADN'’T SEEN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. - WHAT MADE YOU CALL? - HE'’D CALLED ME. I WAS ANSWERING HIS CALL. - WAS THERE SOMETHING HE SAID ON THE PHONE THAT LED YOU TO BELIEVE HE WAS CONSIDERING SUICIDE? - NO. HE SEEMED UPSET. I WASN'’T ABLE TO TAKE THE CALL. - BUT YOU FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY OUT FROM LOS ANGELES? - I SAW HIM A FEW DAYS AGO. HE SEEMED UPSET. - ABOUT WHAT? - HE LOST HIS JOB. HE HADN'’T BEEN ABLE TO FIND WORK. I DON'’T KNOW. - LOTS OF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS WITHOUT PUTTING BULLETS IN THEIR BRAINS. - YEAH. - WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE A SUICIDE TO ME, MISTER... - WALKER. - WALKER. I'’D JUST FEEL A WHOLE BETTER IF THERE WAS A REASON FOR IT. - YOU NEVER KNOW THE REASON FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. - I JUST THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND. FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS, I DON'’T THINK HE HAD TOO MANY FRIENDS. WE'’LL RUN A TRACE ON HIM SO WE CAN NOTIFY HIS FAMILY. MEANWHILE, IF YOU'’VE GOT ANY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US, IT'’D SURE MAKE MY JOB A HECK OF A LOT EASIER. - I HAVEN'’T SEEN HIM FOR 12 YEARS. - IT'’D BE A SHAME, SOMEBODY LYING DEAD SOMEPLACE AND HIS FAMILY NOT KNOW IT. - YOU'’VE GOT OUR NUMBER. CALL US IF ANYTHING TURNS UP. - WELL, I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD. IF IT WAS YOU, AND IF HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS, I'’D WANT HIM TO HELP. - HONEY, I DIDN'’T KNOW THIS MAN. - WAS HE THE GUY THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO CALL LAST NIGHT? - YES. - DID YOU HAVE THE FEELING THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG? - NO, HE JUST SEEMED TO BE HAVING A TOUGH TIME. - WELL, MAYBE ONE OF YOUR OTHER FRIENDS WILL HAVE SOMETHING. - WHAT OTHER FRIENDS? - DIDN'’T YOU SAY THERE WERE TWO OTHER GUY? - HONEY, I HADN'’T SEEN OF THEM IN 12 YEARS. I DON'’T KNOW WHY HE DID IT. - OH, I'’M NOT ASKING YOU WHY HE DID IT. THEY'’RE JUST ASKING YOU TO HELP FIND HIS FAMILY. - HONEY, I HAVE SUCKED MUD IN THAT GOD-FORSAKEN PLACE FOR A YEAR. LET'’S LEAVE IT ALONE, ALL RIGHT? - SUCKED MUD? - YOU DID, CERTAINLY. - WELL, THE GENTLEMEN, THE BOTTOM LINE, AS THEY SAY, AS ATTORNEYS FOR THE BUILDER, WE'’VE DRAWN A DIFFICULT HAND TO PLAY. WOULDN'’T YOU AGREE? - BARNEY, YOU'’RE A MASTER OF UNDERSTATEMENT. - I WOULD SAY THAT. - BARNEY, I'’M NOT SURE WE CAN'’T USE THIS REPORT TO OUR ADVANTAGE. - HOW SO? - WELL, IT DOESN'’T ISOLATE A CAUSE. YOU CAN'’T POINT A FINGER AND SAY, THAT'’S WHAT HAPPENED. THEN IT COMES DOWN TO WHO CAN BEST PERSUADE THE JURY. - I'’D FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT IF WE DIDN'’T HAVE TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF PROOF. - WE DON'’T HAVE TO NECESSARILY-- - EVEN WITH THE BURDEN OF PROOF, NED, IF WE CAN SAY TO A JURY, "LOOK, WE HIRED THE BEST EXPERTS AVAILABLE, "AND SO DID THE PLAINTIFF. "AND NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY ONE THING THAT RUSKIN DID THAT WAS WRONG." ON THE OTHER HAND, WE CAN INTRODUCE A WHOLE LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT SAYS HE DID EVERYTHING HE WAS SUPPOSED TO. - I KEEP THINKING WE'’RE GONNA BE SURPRISED. I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET ANOTHER EXPERT. - NED, WE GO TO TRIAL IN SIX WEEKS. - AND COURT IN 20 MINUTES. LET'’S CONTINUE THIS LATER, GENTLEMEN. - I DON'’T THINK ANOTHER EXPERT WILL HELP US, AND IT COULD HURT. WE JUST HAVE TO PUT THE FACE ON WHAT WE'’VE GOT. - YEAH, BUT WHAT HAVE WE GOT? - WHAT THEY HAVE GOT? - THEY'’VE GOT FOUR WIDOWS ON THE FRONT ROW. - MR. WALKER, MAY I SEE YOU FOR JUST A MINUTE, SIR? SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT WORK THIS WAY. I KNOW YOU MUST BE VERY BUSY. - THAT'’S ALL RIGHT. COME IN. - I WAS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN MR. GIBBS'’ FAMILY. I WAS POKING AROUND HIS STUFF, AND I COME ACROSS THIS. IT SEEMS ADDRESSED TO YOU. MUST HAVE WRITTEN IT JUST BEFORE HE DIED, HE FORGOT TO PUT UP A LITTLE FLAG ON HIS MAILBOX, AND THE MAILMAN NEVER STOPPED TO GET IT. THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD GIVE US A LEAD. - HEY, THANKS. IF THERE IS, I'’LL LET YOU KNOW. - AREN'’T YOU GONNA READ IT? - I HAVE TO BE IN COURT IN 15 MINUTES. - OH, SURE. WELL, I'’D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD READ IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. - YEAH. - IT LOOKS THE MARINES AREN'’T GONNA BE MUCH HELP. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - WELL, WE GOT A REPORT BACK THIS MORNING. YOUR FRIEND'’S BEEN AWOL SINCE 1971. - AWOL? - THAT'’S WHAT THEY SAY. DIDN'’T YOU KNOW THAT? - NO. - WELL, THEY SAID THEY'’D RUN A CHECK ON IT, BUT IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE. HE SORT OF BECAME A NON-PERSON. WELL, THANK YOU, MR. WALKER. I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. - SURE. all: HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GAY! [cheers and applause] - SPEECH, GAY, A SPEECH! - I WISH... - SHE'’S REALLY GONNA DO IT. [laughter] - THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD COULD FEEL AS HAPPY AS I DO. - THAT BAD, HUH? - AND AS LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A NICE LIFE. all: AWW. - AND SUCH GOOD FRIENDS TO SHARE IT WITH. - HEAR, HEAR. - ABSOLUTELY. - IF ONLY WE HAD A HOT TUB. [laughter] - LET'’S EAT THE CAKE BEFORE IT GETS COLD. - WE HAVE HOT CAKE? HEY, MATT, WHO WAS THE COP I SAW YOU WITH TODAY? - JUST A COP. - WHAT COP? - I'’LL BET MATT'S BEING AUDITED. - THEY WOULDN'’T SEND A POLICEMAN FOR THAT, WOULD THEY? - NOT UNLESS THEY STUMBLED ACROSS HIS SWISS BANK ACCOUNT. - YOU'’D BETTER CONFESS, KID, BEFORE IT GETS ANY WORSE. - IT'’S NOTHING, REALLY. SOMEBODY I KNOW DIED RECENTLY, AND THEY'’RE TRYING TO LOCATE HIS FAMILY. THIS COP FOUND A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TO ME BEFORE HE DIED AND BROUGHT IT TO THE OFFICE. - WHAT DID THE LETTER SAY? - I HAVEN'’T READ IT YET. I WAS IN COURT ALL DAY, HONEY. - WHO WAS IT WHO DIED? - SOMEONE I KNEW IT VIETNAM. - OH, I DIDN'’T KNOW YOU WERE IN VIETNAM. HOW COME YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT? NED, DID YOU KNOW THAT MATT WAS IN VIETNAM? - YEAH, BUT I ALSO KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING HE DIDN'’T FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT. - ELLIE, DOES HE TALK ABOUT IT TO YOU? - NOPE, NOT EVEN WHEN I TWIST HIS ARM. - HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THAT? [laughter] - WHY DON'’T YOU TALK ABOUT IT? - GAY, COME ON. - I'’M JUST ASKING, NED. IF MATT DOESN'’T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT, HE CAN JUST SAY NO. - FEEL FREE, MATTHEW. - WERE YOU ON THE FRONT LINES? IS THAT HOW THEY SAY IT? - SAY WHAT? - YOU KNOW, DID YOU HAVE TO SHOOT AT PEOPLE? - YES. GAY, I'’D REALLY RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT. IT WASN'’T THE MOST PLEASANT TIME I'’D EVER SPENT. - OH, I'’M SORRY, MATT. IT JUST SEEMED ODD. - GAY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING PLEASANT, LIKE BEING AUDITED? [laughter] - ARE YOU COMING TO BED? - IN A LITTLE WHILE. - IS THERE SOMETHING THE MATTER? - NO. - DID GAY UPSET YOU? - REALLY, I'’M OKAY. - IS IT THE LETTER? - MEL, DON'’T BUG ME ABOUT THE LETTER. COME ON. JUST GO ON TO BED, WILL YOU? I LOVE YOU. - THANKS. I LOVE YOU TOO. IS THIS IMPORTANT? - IS WHAT IMPORTANT? - WHAT WE'’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. MATT, JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH. IF IT'’S NOT IMPORTANT, SAY SO. I'’LL BELIEVE YOU. - IT'’S NOT IMPORTANT. - LIAR. - HONEY. LOOK, IT'’S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, AND IT'’S SOMETHING I DON'’T WANNA TALK ABOUT. - WHY? - BECAUSE. I DON'’T WANT IT TO EXIST BETWEEN US. IF WE TALK ABOUT IT, IT WILL. - OH. JUST DON'’T SAY THAT IN PUBLIC, OKAY? - WHAT? - '’CAUSE THAT WILL SET BACK THE CAUSE OF PSYCHOTHERAPY ABOUT 50 YEARS. MATT. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT JUST BECAUSE WE'’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS THING, IT DOESN'’T EXIST BETWEEN US? - YOU'’RE NOT MY THERAPIST, HONEY. - NO, THAT'’S TRUE. I'’M NOT. GOOD NIGHT. - HEY. I'’LL BE IN THERE IN A LITTLE WHILE, HONEY. - DEAR WATTS, YOU WERE RIGHT. I AM BOTH PEOPLE. I AM THE GUY WHO CAN POINT HIS FINGER AND TURN LIFE INTO DEATH BEFORE YOU VERY EYES. I USED TO THINK ONLY GOD COULD DO THAT. I'’M ALSO THE GUY WHO GETS UP IN THE MORNING AND EATS HIS CORN FLAKES, AND HE WORRIES ABOUT BEING LATE FOR WORK. IT'’S NOT THAT I CAN'’T BE BOTH. IT'’S THAT I SHOULDN'T BE. OR MAYBE IT'’S JUST THAT I DON'’T LIKE EITHER ONE. I BOTCHED IT, WALKS. I STARTED OUT WANTING TO BE A HERO, AND I ENDED UP IN BIN MAU. YOU ASKED ABOUT MY SON, MARSHALL. YOU WERE ALWAYS GOOD AT MAKING SENSE OF THINGS. WOULD YOU MAKE SENSE WITH HIM NOW, MARSH? I FEEL LIKE I OWE HIM THAT. AND I THINK HE'’D LISTEN TO YOU. I DON'’T WANT HIM GOING THROUGH HIS LIFE NOT KNOWING WHO OR WHAT HIS DADDY WAS. IT SOUNDS FUNNY TO SAY THIS, BUT I THINK OF YOU AND MARSH AS MY NET OF KIN. SO LONG, WALKS. - GIBBY... - BOY, THIS STINKS. I MEAN, THE GUY'’S AN INSPECTOR FOR NINE YEARS. HE MUST'’VE SEEN TEN MILLION I-BEAMS IN NINE YEARS. WHY, SUDDENLY, DOES HE MISS THIS ONE? MATTHEW. - I'’M SORRY. - YOU'’RE REALLY OUT IT. WHAT'’S THE MATTER WITH YOU? IS IT YOUR BUDDY? DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, MR. WALKER? - [chuckles] NO, THANK YOU, DOCTOR. IT'’S OVER. THERE'’S NOT A DAMN SECOND OF IT THAT COULD BE CHANGED. - LISTEN, MATT, IF GAY WAS A LITTLE PUSHY THE OTHER NIGHT... - NO, NO, NO. HE KILLED HIMSELF. WROTE ME A LETTER RIGHT BEFORE HE DID IT. THINKS I CAN MAKE SENSE OUT OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN VIETNAM, AND HE WANTS ME TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIS SON. - WHAT HAPPENED? - NOTHING I CAN MAKE SENSE OUT OF. - WERE YOU TWO GUYS CLOSE? - I DIDN'’T THINK SO. YOU WERE AFRAID TO BE CLOSE TO ANYBODY OVER THERE. I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT. I SPENT THE LAST 12 YEARS TRYING TO FORGET THIS. - FORGET WHAT? - I GOTTA GET HIM BURIED, THEN. - LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. - NO. I'’M OKAY. - YOU DON'’T LOOK OKAY. - OH, NO. THANKS VERY MUCH. - LISTEN, MY FRIEND. IF WE BLOW THIS RUSKIN CASE, BARNEY WILL HAVE OUR BUTTS IN A SLING. - WE WON'’T. - HELLO? HELLO? - CASS? - YES, WHO IS IT? - I THINK YOU SHOULD HEAR THIS. JUAN DE LA TORRE, I'’D LIKE YOU TO MEET MATTHEW WALKER. - HOW ARE YOU DOING? - GO AHEAD, JUAN. TELL YOUR STORY. - SIR LARWIN, I DON'’T KNOW IF I DO THE RIGHT THING ME. - BELIEVE ME. YOU'’VE DONE THE RIGHT THING. JUST GO AHEAD. - AS I TOLD SENIOR LARWIN, THE ENGINEERS DON'’T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WHEN THEY COME STUDY WHY THIS BUILDING FALL. - YES. - THAT IS BECAUSE THEY COME TOO LATE. THE CONCRETE IS ALREADY HARD BY THE TIME THEY COME. - I'’M SORRY. I DON'’T UNDERSTAND. - JUAN WORKS FOR MR. RUSKIN. IS THAT RIGHT? - SI, SEÑOR. - FOR HOW LONG? - EIGHT YEARS. I WORK WITH CONCRETE. BUT MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT, I WORK WITH CONCRETE IN MEXICO. I KNOW WHAT CONCRETE FEELS LIKE. THE DAY BEFORE THIS BUILDING FALLS DOWN, I NOTICE LITTLE CRACKS ALL OVER THE CONCRETE. - THE DAY BEFORE. - SI, SEÑOR. IT'’S NOT LIKE IT SHOULD BE. - WELL, WHAT WOULD CAUSE THESE LITTLE CRACKS? - WELL, I ASK THESE QUESTIONS MYSELF. MIRA, SEÑOR, WHEN YOU POUR CONCRETE, YOU WANT IT TO HARDEN SLOWLY SO IT WILL BE STRONG, SO YOU SPRAY ON A CURING COMPOUND. IT KEEPS THE CONCRETE TO STAY DAMP, AND IT HELPS IT TO HARDEN THE RIGHT WAY. BUT THIS CONCRETE HAD CRACKS IN IT. IT'’S NOT RIGHT. SO I CHECK INTO THE RECORDS. I TALK TO THE OTHER WORKERS, AND THERE WAS A MISTAKE. - WHAT SORT OF MISTAKE? - THEY NEVER SPRAY ON THE CURING COMPOUND. - NEVER? AT ALL? - THE DAY BEFORE THIS BUILDING FELL DOWN, I TELL THIS TO MR. RUSKIN AND SAY WE SHOULD STOP WORK UNTIL THE CONCRETE IS SAFE. - YOU TOLD THIS TO MR. RUSKIN? AND WHAT DID HE SAY? - HE SAY HE CAN'’T AFFORD TO STOP. HE SAY THE BUILDING SAFE. HE SAY NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. - JUAN, WILL YOU TELL MR. WALKER WHY YOU HAVEN'’T SAID ANYTHING BEFORE THIS, WHY YOU DIDN'’T GIVE A DEPOSITION WHEN THE LAWYERS CAME AROUND? - I DON'’T HAVE PAPERS TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY. MR. RUSKIN SAY IF I SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY, THEY WILL SEND ME BACK. - MR. RUSKIN SAID THAT TO YOU? - YEAH. HE GIVES ME MONEY. HE TELLS ME NOT TO COME TO WORK. - WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE NOW? - WORKERS HAVE DIED. MY WIFE SAYS I WILL GET INTO TROUBLE IF I DON'’T SAY ANYTHING. I TELL HER I AM IN TROUBLE IF I DO SAY SOMETHING. SHE SAYS, "THEN, YOU MUST TELL THE TRUTH." - OH, RUSKIN'’S BEEN LYING. HE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG. HE KNEW IT WAS HIS FAULT. HE'’S BEEN LYING TO HIS OWN LAWYERS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. - IF DE LA TORRE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. - AW, COME ON. WHY WOULD HE LIE? HE'’S RISKING DEPORTATION BY COMING OUT. - I DON'’T KNOW WHY HE LIED. IT'’S A CAN OF WORMS I'D JUST SOON NOT HAVE TO OPEN. - YEAH, BUT IF IT GETS OPENED AT THE TRIAL, WE LOSE. RUSKIN PAYS ENOUGH DAMAGES TO BUY YUGOSLAVIA. - WHY DID HE COME TO US? - I DON'’T KNOW. MAYBE WE'’RE THE ONLY LAWYERS HE KNOWS. - MAYBE. I WISH HE HADN'’T. THERE'’S JUST SOME THINGS I'’D JUST AS SOON NOT KNOW. - WELL, BETTER US THAN THE OTHER GUYS, I GUESS. - LISTEN. WE'’RE SUPPOSED TO SEE RUSKIN TOMORROW. WHY DON'’T WE JUST LAY IT ALL OUT FOR HIM AND SEE IF WE CAN'’T PRESS HIM INTO A SETTLEMENT? - YEAH. HEY, I NEVER EVEN ASKED YOU. HOW DID THINGS GO OUT THERE WITH YOUR BUDDY. - WE FOUND HIS WIFE. - GOOD. I GUESS YOU'’RE RELIEVED, HUH? - YEAH. NEDDY, I HAVEN'’T BEEN MUCH GOOD TO YOU LATELY. THANKS FOR CARRYING MY LOAD IN THIS RUSKIN BUSINESS. - [chuckles] WAIT UNTIL YOU GET MY BILL. - [chuckles] - WHAT'’D YOU SAY HIS NAME WAS? - DE LA TORRE. JUAN DEL LA TORRE. - NO, I DON'’T RECALL ANY CONVERSATION LIKE THE ONE YOU DESCRIBED. - MR. RUSKIN, IF HE TELLS HIS STORY IN COURT, IT WILL GO VERY BADLY FOR US. - WELL, THEN, WE SHOULD SEE THAT HE DOESN'’T, SHOULDN'’T WE, MATT? HUH? HEY, GET THAT TRUCK OVER TO THE EAST GATE AND GET THE HELL RID OF THAT SCAFFOLDING. - MR. RUSKIN, IT'’S TAKING A HELL OF A CHANCE. IF THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE OTHER SIDE IF THEY EVER FIND HIM... - OH, I DON'’T THINK THEY WILL, BUDDY. - I THINK WHAT WE'’RE TRYING TO SUGGEST IS THAT IN THE FACE OF THIS, WE PROBABLY WOULD BE WISE TO CONSIDER A SETTLEMENT. - MATT, I PAID BARNEY FRENCH TO SAVE ME MONEY, HUH? NOT TO SPEND IT, HEY? NOW, WHY DON'’T YOU TWO GUYS GET BACK TO WORK, HUH? FIND ME SOME LOOPHOLES! - HELLO, JENNY. - GOOD MORNING, MR. LARWIN. OH, MR. WALKER, THERE'’S AN OFFICER TO SEE YOU. - GOOD MORNING, MR. WALKER. DAMNDEST THING I'’VE EVER SEEN. IT'’S HIS WIFE, ALL RIGHT. SHE DON'’T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. - WHAT'’D SHE SAY. - SHE CLOSED THE DOOR IN MY FACE. DAMNDEST THING, REALLY. I JUST THOUGHT YOU BEING A FRIEND OF HIS AND ALL, WELL, SHE'’D TALK TO ME. - HEY, LOOK. I KNOW THIS COME AS A BIG SURPRISE TO YOU GUYS, BUT I WORK FOR A LIVING. - OH. HEY, I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL, MR. WALKER. YOU THINK YOU GOT IT OUT OF YOU HAIR, AND IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK ON YOU. BELIEVE ME, IF YOU WEREN'’T BUDDIES WITH THIS GUY, I WOULDN'’T THINK OF ASKING. I'’VE GOT A CASELOAD THAT'S JUST DRIVING ME NUTS, AND I GUESS I'’M KINDA STUBBORN. I HATE TO GIVE UP ON THIS ONE. - WHO IS IT? - HELLO. OH, HI. I'’M MATT WALKER. - WHAT YOU WANT? - I'’D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE, IF I MAY. I WAS A FRIEND OF YOUR HUSBAND'’S, TOM GIBBS. - YOU THE POLICE? - NO, I'’M NOT. I'’D JUST LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. - OH, PLEASE GO AWAY. - CASS, I CAN'’T. IT'’LL JUST BE A MINUTE. I PROMISE. - ALL RIGHT. COME AROUND TO THE GATE. I'’LL BE RIGHT DOWN. - THANK YOU. - HI. EXCUSE ME. IT'’S KINDA HARD PUTTING UP WITH A THREE-YEAR-OLD. - I KNOW THE FEELING. BUT PLEASE DON'’T BOTHER, ALL RIGHT. I SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR BARGING IN ON YOU. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD HELP ME FIND GIBBY'’S PARENTS. - I ALREADY TOLD THE POLICE. - I KNOW, CASS. I'’M SORRY. IT FEELS AS THOUGH I KNOW YOU, AND WE'’VE NEVER EVEN MET. - WELL, HOW'’D YOU KNOW ME? - I'’VE SEEN YOUR PICTURES ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES. GIBBY CARRIED IT ALL THROUGH VIETNAM, YOU AND MARSH. I USED TO THINK THE TWO OF YOU WERE THE ONLY THINGS WHO GOT HIM THROUGH. - IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. - I CAN'’T BELIEVE HE MEANS NOTHING TO YOU NOW. - I JUST DON'’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE MARINES CAN'’T JUST BURY HIM. - THEY WON'’T, CASS. HE WAS AWOL. - OH, YEAH. RIGHT. WELL, PLEASE SIT DOWN. - THANK YOU. - DID YOU KNOW HIM REAL WELL? - I GUESS WE WERE CLOSER THAN I THOUGHT. - YOU DIDN'’T HAVE TO GO, YOU KNOW. THAT'’S THE STUPID THING. HE ACTUALLY WANTED TO GO. [cries] DAMN IT. I'’M SORRY. I'’M JUST NOT GONNA CRY ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. NOW, IF I ASK YOU REAL NICE TO GO ONE MORE TIME, WOULD YOU DO IT? - I'’M SORRY. I JUST FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO HIM. - WELL, I'’M THIRSTY. HOW '’BOUT YOU? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME LEMONADE OR SOMETHING? - YES, THAT'’D BE NICE. THANK YOU. - YOU KNOW, WHEN TOM JOINED THE MARINES AND WENT AWAY, WE USED TO WRITE THESE REAL LONG LETTERS TO EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW, BACK AND FORTH. AND THEN, SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED. I DON'’T KNOW WHAT, BUT THE LETTERS STARTED GETTING SHORTER AND SHORTER. SOMETIMES, A COUPLE WEEKS WOULD GO BY. I WOULDN'’T HEAR FROM HIM AT ALL. AND ONE DAY, I GOT THE LETTER TELLING ME HE WAS COMING HOME. I WAS SO HAPPY. I HAD MISSED HIM SO MUCH. I COULDN'’T WAIT TO SEE HIM. THEN, WHEN HE SHOWED UP, HE WAS--I DON'’T KNOW. I JUST DIDN'’T RECOGNIZE HIM. HE WAS SO DIFFERENT. HE WAS JUST--IT WAS ALL THE JUNK THAT HE-- FEAR, DARK, YOU KNOW. THAT'’D BE THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT, IS JUST DARK. I WANTED TO WAKE UP MARSH. HE WAS SLEEPING. BUT HE WOULDN'’T LET ME. HE SAID HE WAS SCARED TO SEE MARSH. HE DIDN'’T TRUST HIMSELF AROUND HIM. I DIDN'’T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. HE LOVED MARSH. HE ALWAYS SAID THAT ME AND MARSH IS THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM. THEY LEFT THE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT EVEN SEEING HIM. - WHERE'’D HE GO? - FLORIDA, MAYBE MEXICO. I DON'’T KNOW. IT WAS ABOUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THAT I GOT MY DIVORCE, AND THEN, I MOVED HERE. AND I MET A REAL NICE MAN. I GOT MARRIED. CHANGED MY NAME. I THOUGHT ALL THAT WAS WAY BEHIND ME. [cries] I HAD ANOTHER BABY. I'’M SORRY. SO THEN I DON'’T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. I DON'’T KNOW HOW HE DID IT. BUT HE FOUND ME. HE WANTED TO SEE MARSH, AND I TOLD HIM NO, HE COULDN'’T. MARSH WASN'’T HERE. - WHERE WAS HE? - OH, HE LIVES WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS BACK IN TEXAS, TOM'’S MOM AND DAD. I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM. HE STARTED RUNNING AWAY FROM ME. AND THEN... I FINALLY JUST GONNA KEEP HIM. - DID YOU TELL GIBBY WHERE HE WAS? - I COULDN'’T. - WHY? - BECAUSE I TOLD MARSH HIS DADDY DIED IN THE WAR. IT'’S A TERRIBLE LIE, I KNOW. BUT WHAT COULD I DO? HE KEPT ASKING FOR HIS DADDY. HE HADN'’T SEEN TOM IN SO LONG. - CASS, WHAT ABOUT GIBBY'’S PARENTS? - TOM'’S DEAD. MARSH IS ALIVE, AND AS FAR AS THEY'’RE CONCERNED, IT'’S MORE IMPORTANT FOR MARSH TO REMEMBER HIS DADDY AS... - AS WHAT? - AS A HERO. SOMEONE FOR MARSH TO WANNA BE LIKE WHEN HE GROWS UP. - LOOK, CASS. I'’M SORRY TO HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO BRING ALL OF THIS UP FOR YOU AGAIN. - IT DOESN'’T MATTER. IF IT WASN'’T YOU, IT'D BE SOMETHING ELSE. HE JUST KEEPS COMING UP AND COMING UP. DOESN'’T WANNA GO AWAY. - WE HAVE NO WAY OF JUDGING BARNEY. DE LA TORRE MIGHT BE LYING. MIGHT HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST RUSKIN. - WATNEY, HE IS RISKING HIS NECK BY COMING FORWARD. HE IS NOT GONNA DO THAT FOR SOME GRUDGE. - WE DON'’T KNOW THAT! - ALL RIGHT! WELL, THEN LET'’S LOOK INTO IT. LET'’S CHECK THE PEOPLE DE LA TORRE SAID HE TALKED TO. - COME ON, NED. YOU ACT LIKE YOU'’RE REPRESENTING THE OTHER SIDE. WE'’RE TRYING TO WIN A LAWSUIT. IF DE LA TORRE IS TELLING THE TRUTH, THEN THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN TRUST HIM TO STAY QUIET. - THE QUESTION IS PERJURY, WATNEY. IF WE PUT RUSKIN ON THE STAND, HE'’S GONNA PERJURE HIMSELF. - THAT'’S RUSKIN PROBLEM. - IT IS OUR PROBLEM IF WE PUT HIM ON THE STAND. - MATT, WHAT DO YOU THINK? - OH, YEAH. I DON'’T KNOW, BARNEY. - DO YOU THINK IT'’S A RISK WORTH TAKING? - WELL, WE'’RE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE TRIAL. MAYBE THEY WON'’T FIND HIM. - THAT'’S NOT THE POINT. - WHAT'’S YOUR RECOMMENDATION? - I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH IT, IF THAT'’S WHAT YOU MEAN. - OKAY. - NED? - BARNEY, I THINK I WANNA BE TAKEN OFF THIS CASE. - ALL RIGHT, NED. - THE TRANSCRIPTS ARE IN THE BLUE BOXES. THE DEPOSITIONS ARE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. - NED. NED. WE DID WHAT WE COULD. WE ADVISED RUSKIN TO SETTLE. WE ARGUED IT OUT WITH BARNEY. - FOUR MEN ARE DEAD, MATT. YOU'’RE GONNA PUT HIM ON THE STAND. HE IS GONNA PERJURE HIMSELF, AND YOU KNOW THE TRUTH. - WE'’RE PAID TO DEFEND RUSKIN. WE WORK FOR HIM. - THAT'’S A LOTTA CRAP. - WE'’RE NOT THE JUDGE AND JURY. WE'’RE LAWYERS. THAT'’S ALL WE ARE. - OH. WE'’RE LAWYERS. YOU MAKE IT SOUND NICE AND SMALL. IS THAT ALL YOU REALLY THINK WE ARE? - HANG IN THERE WITH ME ON THIS ONE, WILL YOU? HE'’S BLUFFING. HE'’LL SETTLE BEFORE WE GET TO TRIAL. - MATTIE, IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE BUT YOU... - I JUST HAD A FEELING, BUT I DIDN'’T SAY NOTHING. HE DIDN'’T SAY NOTHING TO YOU THAT NIGHT, DID HE? - HE DID. I DIDN'’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. - I'’VE SEEN IT BEFORE. SOME GUYS, YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES. THEY'’RE LAUGHIN' AND THEY'’RE TALKIN', BUT INSIDE, IT'’S LIKE THEY'’RE HOLLOW. AND IT SCARES YOU. SO YOU JUST TURN AWAY AND YOU THINK, "I DIDN'’T SEE NOTHING." BECAUSE IF YOU DID SEE SOMETHING, YOU'’D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND YOU JUST DON'’T KNOW WHAT. - MONROE, LET'’S BURY HIM. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND HIS PEOPLE. - I FOUND HIS WIFE. I KNOW WHERE HIS FOLKS ARE, AND HIS SON. - AND WHAT? - THEY DON'’T WANT HIM. HIS WIFE TOLD HIS KIDDIE HE WAS KILLED IN THE WAR. - KILLED IN THE WAR. [chuckles]. AND WHAT ABOUT HIS FOLKS? - THEY WANNA LEAVE IT THE WAY IT IS. - JUST ANOTHER LIE, HUH? YOU STICK '’EM IN THE GROUND, COVER HIM UP. EVERYBODY JUST GO ON ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. - MONROE, WE GOTTA GET HIM BURIED. - NOT ME, MAN. - IT'’S NOT A LIE. - HEY, IT'’S A DAMN LIE. WALKS, I USED TO LIE IN THAT BED SO ANGRY. I MEAN, JUST LYING THERE, THINKING, NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS ANGRY AT OR WHO OR WHY OR WHAT. - MONROE, HE WANTS ME TO TELL HIS KID ABOUT BIN MAU. - HEY. HEY. THEN YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM. - WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO? - I MEAN, I DON'’T KNOW. MAYBE NONE. BUT AT LEAST IT'’S THE TRUTH. I MEAN, WOULDN'’T YOU WANNA KNOW IF IT WAS YOUR DADDY? - WHY ME? WHY DIDN'’T HE WRITE THAT LETTER TO YOU? I HAVEN'’T SEEN HIM IN 12 YEARS. - MAYBE HE HAD A FIX ON YOU IN '’NAM OR SOMETHING. - WHAT'’S THAT MEAN? - YOU WAS DIFFERENT, WALKS. I MEAN, YOU DIDN'’T TAKE NOTHING OFF OF DECKER. IT WAS LIKE YOU WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERED WHAT BEING NORMAL WAS. GIBBY LOOKED UP TO YOU. YOU WAS CONSCIOUS WHEN THINGS STARTED TO GO WRONG FOR HIM. - I CAN'’T MAKE SENSE OUT OF WHAT HAPPENED AT BIN MAU. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN THAT TO HIS KID. - MAYBE YOU DON'’T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT. MAYBE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST SAY WHAT HAPPENED. - HE'’S GONNA WANNA KNOW WHY. HE'’S GONNA ASK WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WE ARE. HOW DO I ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS? - JUST SAY WHAT HAPPENED. AND IF THEY STILL DON'’T WANT HIM, YOU COME BACK TO ME, AND WE BURY HIM TOGETHER. HEY, WALKS. IT'’S NOT THE KID WHO'S ASKING WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WE ARE. IT'’S YOU. - MATT? - HI, I'’M FINE. I'’M FINE. HI. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I'’VE CALLED OVER FOR YOU. - OH, I HAD TO STOP FOR A DRINK. - WHAT'’S WRONG? - I'’M DRUNK. - I DON'’T BELIEVE YOU ANYMORE. YOU'’RE SHUTTING ME OUT OF YOUR LIFE, AND I DON'’T LIKE IT. YOU'’RE MAKING ME AFRAID. I DON'’T EVEN KNOW WHAT OF. - IT'’S BETTER THAT WAY. - NOT FOR ME. AND NOT FOR US. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - IT MEANS I'’M TIRED OF LIVING WITH A STRANGER AND PRETENDING IT DOESN'’T MATTER. - ELLIE, WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'’LL HAVE WHEN YOU FINISH PEELING MY SKIN AWAY. - I AM NOT PEELING YOUR SKIN AWAY. - WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'’LL FIND? - I DON'’T KNOW. I DON'’T KNOW. BUT I NEVER USED TO WORRY ABOUT IT. - I'’M NOT YOUR PATIENT, ELLIE. DON'’T TRY TO CURE ME. - I AM NOT TRYING TO CURE YOU. OH, I AM SO TIRED OF YOU USING MY WORK TO SHUT ME OUT! - HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME? HMM? HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME? - YOU'’RE SCARING ME. - HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME? - YOU'’RE HURTING ME! KARA. PLEASE GO BACK TO BED, HONEY. - I CAN'’T SLEEP. - YOU'’RE AFRAID, ELLIE? ARE YOU PROTECTING THE KIDS? - YOU SCARED ME. - I CHOOSE GOOD SENSE. SOMETIMES I SCARE MYSELF. - MRS. GIBBS? - YEAH? - I'’M MATT WALKER. I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE PHONE. - OH. OH, HOW DO YOU DO? CLAY'’S ON INSIDE, BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME ON IN. - THANK YOU. - YOU KNOW, CLAY AND I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH OVER THIS THING SINCE WE SPOKE TO YOU. I'’M AFRAID NEITHER ONE OF US QUITE SEES THE POINT. - WELL, I CAN'’T SAY THAT I BLAME YOU, MRS. GIBBS. - WELL, YOU KNOW, MARSH HASN'’T HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT. HE'’S ALWAYS BEEN A TROUBLED BOY. WE HAVEN'’T MUCH KNOWN WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. HE'’S ALWAYS BEEN PROUD OF HIS FATHER. CLAY! CLAY, THIS IS MR. WALKER. - HOW DO YOU DO? PLEASE COME IN. SIT RIGHT DOWN. - THANK YOU. - YOU FLEW ALL THE WAY OUT HERE FROM LOS ANGELES? - YES, SIR. THAT'’S RIGHT. - THAT'’S A LONG WAY TO FLY. - AH, IT WASN'’T TOO BAD. - I'’VE NEVER BEEN TO LOS ANGELES. I CAN'’T SAY I EVER REALLY WANTED TO GO. - CLAY, MR. WALKER WANTS TO TALK TO MARSH. - CAN'’T. I GOT A BUSTED PLOW. I GOTTA GET INTO TOWN AND BACK BEFORE DAWN. - CLAY, PLEASE SIT DOWN. THE BUSTED PLOW CAN WAIT. I'’LL GET US SOME COFFEE. - THANK YOU, MA'’AM. I'’M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU FOLKS WITH THIS. I THINK I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. BUT GIBBY--YOUR SON, TOMMY--WROTE ME A LETTER JUST BEFORE HE DIED, ASK ME TO SEE MARSH AND TELL HIM ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN VIETNAM. HE FELT THAT IT WOULD HELP MARSH TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER. - WHAT IS IT YOU WANT MARSH TO UNDERSTAND, MR. WALKER? HIS DADDY WAS A DESERTER? THAT HE RUN OUT ON HIM AND HIS MOTHER? THAT HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE? - I THINK THAT'’S A PRETTY HARSH WAY OF TELLING HIM. - I DIDN'’T THINK IT RIGHT TO TELL THE BOY THAT HIS DADDY DIED IN THE WAR. IF IT WAS ME, I WOULD'’VE TOLD HIM THE TRUTH, AS HARD AS IT WAS. BUT THAT'’S WATER OVER THE DAM. EMMA AND I FEEL OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MARSH. I JUST DON'’T SEE THE USE IN DIGGING UP THE PAST. - WELL, I'’LL TELL YOU, SIR, I'’VE SPENT THE LAST 12 YEARS TRYING TO BURY THE PAST MYSELF. IT JUST DOESN'’T SEEM TO WANNA STAY DOWN. - I'’D STOP YOU IF I COULD. I'’D RUN YOU RIGHT BACK TO LAS ANGELES AT THE POINT OF A GUN IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD. [sighs] BUT I SUPPOSE THAT YOU'’LL TELL MARSH. THERE'’S NO WAY I COULD STOP YOU. YOU SEE? TOM IS MY SON, AND I RAISED HIM THE BEST WAY I COULD. I SENT HIM OFF TO WAR JUST LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHER FAMILIES SENT THEIR SONS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOUR COUNTRY CALLS, YOU DO YOUR BEST. WE LOVED HIM, MR. WALKER. HE WAS ALL WE HAD. AND NOW, MARSH IS ALL THAT'’S LEFT. YOU SEE. WHAT YOU ARE DOING SEEMS HURTFUL TO ME. IT'’S JUST TEARING DOWN EVERYTHING THE BOY BELIEVED FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS. AND JUST TO TELL HIM THAT HIS DADDY WASN'’T WHO HE THOUGHT HE WAS? EMMA, I'’M GOING INTO TOWN. I'’LL BE BACK LATER. - CLAY. CLAY. I'’M SORRY, MR. WALKER. - THAT'’S ALL RIGHT. - I DON'’T KNOW THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MARSH WILL BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES. YOU'’RE WELCOME TO STAY. - THANK YOU. I... THANK YOU. - MARSH? ARE YOU MARSH? - YES, SIR. - YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID YOU'’D BE COMING ALONG. MY NAME IS MATT WALKER. I'’M A FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'’S. I'’D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. - WHAT ABOUT? - ABOUT YOUR FATHER. - WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER? - WELL, IT'’S KINDA COMPLICATED. IS THERE SOMEWHERE WE CAN TALK. - I'’VE GOT CHORES. - CAN THEY WAIT? - I GOTTA FEED THE HORSES. - WELL, IT'’S VERY IMPORTANT. MAYBE I'’LL WALK ALONG WITH YOU. MARSHALL, I WANNA TELL YOU A TRUE STORY. BUT IT'’S A TRUTH THAT'’S HARD TO TELL. IT'’LL BE HARD TO HEAR. SO I WANT YOU TO HOLD YOUR JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT I SAY UNTIL I'’M FINISHED. IS THAT A DEAL? - OKAY. - YOUR DAD DIDN'’T DIE IN THE WAR. - I KNEW THAT. - HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT. - '’CAUSE NO ONE WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT HIM, EVEN THOUGH HE'’S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG HERO. - SO YOU KNEW HE WAS ALIVE. - I KNEW SOMETHING WAS FUNNY. I WANTED HIM TO BE A HERO, SO I BELIEVED IT. - MARSH? - YEAH. - HE'’S DEAD NOW. HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE A SHORT TIME AGO. I'’M SORRY. I KNOW THAT'’S A HARD THING TO HEAR. AND IT'’S PROBABLY PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT YOUR DAD LOVED YOU VERY MUCH. HE USED TO CARRY AROUND PICTURES OF YOU AND YOUR MOM OVER THERE. BY THE TIME HE LEFT, THEY WERE ALMOST FALLING APART, HE'’D TAKEN THEM OUT AND LOOKED AT THEM SO MUCH. YOU WERE WHAT KEPT HIM GOING AND WHAT HE WANTED TO COME HOME TO. YOUR DAD LOVED YOU, MARSH. BUT COMING HOME AND SEEING YOU WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM BECAUSE AS MUCH AS HE CARED ABOUT YOU, THAT'’S HOW MUCH SEEING YOU REMINDED OF SOMETHING OF SOMETHING THAT WAS BOTHERING HIM A GREAT DEAL. - YOU MEAN THOSE KIDS? - WHAT KIDS? - THE KIDS HE SHOT AT BIN MAU. - HOW DO THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT BEN MAU? - WELL, BECAUSE I SAW HIM. HE CAME HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. - GIBBY CAME HERE? - HE JUST SHOWED UP ONE DAY. I SAW HIM AT SCHOOL. HE WAS SITTING IN HIS CAR, JUST LOOKING AT ME. I RECOGNIZED HIM FROM HIS PICTURE THAT MOM HAD. ANYWAY, HE GOT OUT OF HIS CAR. HE WALKED OVER TO ME, AND HE SAID, "MARSH, I'’M YOUR DAD." JUST LIKE THAT. HE TOOK ME FOR A RIDE. - AND HE TOLD YOU ABOUT BIN MAU? - YEAH. - AND THEN WHAT? - WELL, HE ASKED ME HOW I FELT ABOUT IT. - AND YOU TOLD HIM? - I TOLD HIM THAT I WISHED HE'’D NEVER COME BACK. THAT IT WOULD'’VE BEEN BETTER THAT HE HAD DIED. I SAID TERRIBLE THINGS TO HIM, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I WANTED HIM TO ARGUE WITH ME, TO TELL ME THAT I WAS WRONG. BUT HE DIDN'’T. HE JUST SAID, "WELL, MAYBE YOU'’RE RIGHT." AND THEN HE JUST WENT AWAY. I WISHED I HADN'’T SAID ALL THAT. BUT I CAN'’T TAKE IT BACK. IT'’S TOO LATE. - MAYBE THAT'’S WHY HE WANTED US TO TALK. - WERE YOU THERE THAT NIGHT THAT HE SHOT ALL THOSE KIDS? - YES. - DID YOU SHOOT THEM TOO? - YES. - HOW COME IT WAS JUST HIM, THEN? - JUST HIM WHAT? - JUST HIM THAT GOT SO SCREWED UP BY IT. WHO RAN AWAY. - MAYBE YOUR DAD WASN'’T VERY GOOD AT PUSHING THINGS OUT OF HIS MIND. - WERE YOU? - IN A WAY. - HOW? - I DON'’T KNOW. I JUST DID. - DID YOU EVER TALK TO MY DAD ABOUT IT? - YES. SOME. I SAW HIM JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE HE DIED. - WHAT'’D YOU SAY? - I DON'’T KNOW. I TOLD HIM THAT IT WASN'’T GONNA DO ANY GOOD TO KEEP GOING OVER IT. THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE SOMEBODY IF IT WAS REALLY BOTHERING HIM. I DON'’T THINK I DID HIM A LOT OF GOOD. - BECAUSE HE COULDN'’T FORGET. - NO, I DON'’T THINK HE COULD. - [cries] OH, BOY. IT'’S FUNNY HOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT MAKES SENSE IN A DIFFERENT KINDA WAY. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - MAYBE MY DAD WASN'’T SO BAD AT ALL. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE WASN'’T THE ONE WHO RAN AWAY. [people yelling] - THE FOLLOWING DEPORTEES HAVE BEEN BOARDED ONTO BUSES. HERNANDEZ, CECILIA. IGLESIAS, ENRIQUE. GARCIA, CARRETZA. - MISS! DO YOU HAVE A JUAN DE LA TORRE? - DE LA TORRE? NOPE, NOT ON THE LIST. - HE CALLED ME FROM HERE AN HOUR AGO. I'’M HIS LAWYER. - JUST A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. YES, HE WAS IN THE FIRST GROUP THIS MORNING. YOU'’RE TOO LATE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I'’M TOO LATE? - WELL, HE'’S ALREADY ON THAT BUS THAT'’S LEAVING. JUAN! - IT COULD'’VE BEEN A COINCIDENCE. - OH, YEAH, SOME COINCIDENCE. - PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE PICKED UP EVERY DAY. - MATTIE, HE LIVED IN A BUILDING FULL OF ILLEGALS. HE AND HIS WIFE ARE THE ONLY ONES THEY PICKED UP. RUSKIN HAS JUST BEEN USING US. - RUSKIN HIRED US. YOU THINK THAT LETS US OFF THE HOOK? - I THINK IT CHANGES THINGS. - YOU'’VE GOT A LOT MORE FOR SALE THAN I DO. I DIDN'’T MEAN THAT, MATT. IT'’S NOT YOU I'M ANGRY WITH. IT'’S ME. DE LA TORRE CAME TO US WITH THE TRUTH, AND WE BETRAYED HIM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME SICK? I KNEW ALL ALONG RUSKIN WASN'’T GONNA SETTLE. - I DON'’T CARE WHAT THAT IDIOT SAYS. WE LOST TODAY'’S WORK BECAUSE OF HIS RAID. YOU TELL HIM TO GET THAT EQUIPMENT HERE TOMORROW. - YES, SIR. - JACK, HOLD IT! - WHAT'’S UP, MATT? I'’M IN A BIG HURRY. - JACK, JUAN DE LA TORRE WAS PICKED UP LAST NIGHT. THEY SENT HIM BACK. DID YOU TURN HIM IN? - IS THIS IMPORTANT TO OUR CASE? - IT'’S IMPORTANT TO ME. - YOU ACT AS IF TURNING IN A WETBACK WERE A CRIME. NO APOLOGIES FROM ME. - WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? - I CAN'’T UNDERSTAND YOUR PREOCCUPATION WITH THIS QUESTION. - WAS HE? - LOOK, MATT. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE. YOU'’RE A FINE LAWYER. BARNEY RESPECTS YOUR ABILITY, AND YOU'’VE DONE GOOD WORK FOR US. NOW, IF WE DON'’T LOSE OUR NERVE, WE CAN WIN THIS GIG. - WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? - I HAVEN'’T GIVEN YOU MY ADVICE YET. - WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? - MY ADVICE IS DON'’T LOSE YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU'’RE LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH. - WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? WAS HE TELLING THE TRUTH? - LET GO OF ME! GET OFF! [indistinct shouting] - ALL RIGHT! THAT'’S ENOUGH! THAT'’S ENOUGH! - WE'’RE HERE! WE'’RE HERE! WE'RE HERE! MARTY, GET THE GIFT. - ELLIE? - OUT HERE. - THERE YOU ARE. - ELLIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING? - HI. - WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP? - WELL, YOU CAN BOTH CARRY. - OOH. WHERE DID YOU GET THESE LOVELY MUSHROOMS? - OH, I'’M HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THE PRODUCE MANAGER. - [chuckles] LUCKY. - LUCKY MANAGER. WHERE'’S MATT? - HE'’S IN THE DEN, I THINK. TELL HIM THAT HE NEEDS TO START THE BARBECUE, WOULD YOU? - YEAH. - NED, I'’M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. - ME TOO. - [sighs] HE NEEDS TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. I'’VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THIS. - I KNOW. - HEY, MATT. - HEY, NED. HOW YOU DOING? - BETTER THAN YOU FROM THE LOOKS OF IT. - I TOLD ELLIE I TOOK A TENNIS RACQUET IN THE FACE. - [chuckles] BARNEY TELEPHONED ME YESTERDAY. - MMM. - HE HEARD FROM RUSKIN. - OH, YEAH? - HE WANTED TO KNOW IF I KNEW WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON. - AND DID YOU? - I TOLD HIM NO, BUT THAT ANYBODY WHO WANTED TO PUNCH OUT RUSKIN WAS ALL RIGHT WITH ME. NED, I ASKED HIM TO TAKE ME OFF THE CASE AGAIN. THERE'’S NO GOING BACK THIS TIME. - WHAT'’D HE SAY? - HE SAID, "FINE." HE'’S ASKED ME TO FLY TO FRESNO TOMORROW. - FRESNO? - FRESNO. SOME FARMER'’S LAWSUIT. I'’M LUCKY HE DIDN'T SEND ME TO SIBERIA. - NED, WHAT KIND OF PERSON AM I? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - GOOD OR BAD? - YOU'’RE ONE OF THE BEST MEN I'’VE EVER MET. - I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A GOOD LAWYER. - WELL, I'’VE SEEN WORSE. - COMING OUT OF VIETNAM, LAW SEEMED SO DEPENDABLE TO ME. - DEPENDABLE? [chuckles] THAT'’S NOT THE WORD I'’D USED. - I MEAN, NEDDY, IT WAS A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS, A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS. IT WAS LIKE A LIFE RAFT TO A DROWNING MAN. - MATT, I DON'’T KNOW WHAT VIETNAM HAS TO DO WITH THIS EXACTLY... BUT IF IT STILL BOTHERS YOU, MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOMEBODY. - YOU MEAN, LIKE A PSYCHIATRIST OR SOMETHING? - WELL, TALK TO SOMEBODY, MAN. I MEAN, PEOPLE DO IT ALL THE TIME. - YEAH. - VIETNAM MUST HAVE BEEN A TOUGH TIME. IT MUST BE VERY HARD TO ADJUST TO NORMAL LIFE AFTER THAT, EVEN YEARS AFTER THAT. ALL I'’M SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP. - HELP WHAT? FORGET? - NO. ADJUST. - I'’VE MANAGED THAT ALL BY MYSELF, NED. I'’VE ADJUSTED PERFECTLY. - WHAT YOU'’D FIND OUT, JIMBO? - OFFICER, LEADING ON THE 90TH LAP. - WHOO-WHOO. - WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. - OH, JIM'’S GOT A BIG BET ON THE INDIANAPOLIS 500. IT'’S A BIG OFFICE POOL. - SO WHO DO WE WANNA WIN? - MARIO ANDRETTI, OF COURSE. - NO WAY. - OH, NO. - MATT, AREN'’T HAVING ANY? - NOT RIGHT NOW. - MATT'’S BEING MYSTERIOUS. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT? - THE KIDS. - WHERE ARE THE KIDS, ELLIE? - OH, THEY'’RE VISITING AT GRANDMA'’S FOR THE WEEKEND. - NOT THOSE KIDS. - OH, WHAT KIDS. - THE ONES WE SHOT. - PARDON ME? - THE KIDS WE SHOT IN VIETNAM. - JIM, WOULD YOU PLEASE GET ME ANOTHER ONE? - IT WASN'’T AN ATROCITY OR ANYTHING. IT WAS DARK. WE COULDN'’T SEE. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE WHAT AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON WILL DO TO A HUMAN BODY. JUST TEAR IT APART. - MATT, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - AND STILL, THERE WAS THIS ONE KID WHO KEPT CRYING FOR HIS MAMA. OH, MY GOD. THAT MAKES YOU REALIZE HARD WE CLING TO LIFE, DOESN'’T IT? - EXCUSE ME. I'’LL GET THE COFFEE. - MATT, DO YOU WANNA GET INTO THIS? - I'’M JUST TELLING YOU, NED. YOU SAID TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. - THIS ISN'’T THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR PLACE, MATT. - IT'’S MEMORIAL DAY, JIM. IT'’S PERFECT. BESIDES, I THOUGHT YOU ALL WANTED TO KNOW. I DON'’T MEAN WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL DAY. I JUST WANTED TO MENTION IT. AND THEN, WE COULD CARRY IT ON. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, NED? ADJUST? WE COULD ALL ADJUST. - MATT, ELLIE MADE A TERRIFIC PICNIC. LET'’S ENJOY IT, HUH? - I'’M SORRY, ELLIE. - IT'’S ALL RIGHT. - MATT, WHY DON'’T WE JUST FORGET ABOUT IT FOR NOW? - I DON'’T WANNA FORGET ABOUT IT, JIM. I WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT IT, OKAY? - OKAY. - IT WAS AT NIGHT. WE WERE OUT ON AMBUSH. YOU SET YOUR MEN IN A KIND OF A HORSESHOE, ALL FACING IN ONE DIRECTION DOWN A PATH OR A TREE LINE, AND THEN YOU WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO WALK INTO IT. SOMETIMES, WHEN WE WERE OUT ALONE, WE'’D DECLARE A KIND OF PRIVATE TRUCE AND JUST LET SOMEBODY WALK THROUGH AND LET '’EM HAVE THEIR LIVES. THEY DIDN'’T EVEN KNOW WE WERE THERE. BUT THIS NIGHT, THE CAPTAIN WAS WITH US, DECKER. WE HAD SET UP DOWN THE PATH FROM THIS LITTLE VILLAGE. BIN... [clears through] BIN MAU, IT WAS CALLED. DECKER FELT THE VILLAGERS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE VIETCONG, AND HE WANTED SOME ACTION. ACTION ISN'’T EXACTLY THE RIGHT WORD. WHAT HE WANTED WAS DEATH. - MATT, I DON'’T THINK THE WOMEN NEED TO HEAR THIS. - I DON'’T THINK ANYONE NEEDS TO HEAR IT. - IT'’S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM TELL IT. - WE SAT THERE TILL 2:00 IN THE MORNING. IT WAS DARK. IT WAS SO DARK, YOU LITERALLY COULDN'’T SEE YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. AND THEN WE HEARD SOMETHING ON THE PATH. WE DIDN'’T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. WE COULDN'’T SEE ANYTHING. BUT THE VILLAGERS KNEW. THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'’T SUPPOSED TO BE OUT THERE AT NIGHT. ANYTHING THAT MOVED, IT WAS FAIR GAME. THAT WAS--THOSE WERE THE RULES. SO WE OPENED UP, AND WE COULDN'’T SEE WHAT WE WERE HITTING, BUT YOU COULD TELL FROM THE SCREAMING THAT IT WAS BAD. WE WERE JUST TEARING '’EM APART. THEN WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPPED, AND IT GOT QUIET, ONE OF THEM WAS MOANING. IT WAS HARDLY A HUMAN SOUND, BUT IT SOUNDED KINDA LIKE... "MAMA. MAMA!" SO DECKER WAS AFRAID THE MOANING WAS GONNA GIVE US AWAY, SO HE WANTED ONE OF OUR MEN TO GO DOWN AND FINISH HIM OFF. SO HE PICKED ONE OF THE GUYS FROM MY SQUAD, A LITTLE TEXAN NAMED GIBBS. GIBBY WENT ON DOWN THERE. WHEN HE GOT IN THERE, HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE KIDS, SIX YEARS OLD, SEVEN AT THE MOST. AND THEN, THE MOON CAME OUT, AND WE COULD ALL SEE THEM. THERE WERE FIVE OF THEM, JUST TORN TO PIECES. OH, THEY WERE A MESS. - CARL. - SORRY, ELLIE. - GO AHEAD, MATT. - GIBBY WAS JUST SICK. "MY GOD!" HE KEPT SAYING, "OH, MY GOD, WE..." [cries] "SHOT A BUNCH OF KIDS." OVER AND OVER. "WE SHOT A BUNCH OF KIDS." HE PICKED UP THIS ONE KID, THE ONE THAT STILL ALIVE, AND HE HELD HIM IN HIS ARMS, AND HE WAS TRYING TO STOP THE BLEEDING. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. SO HE SAID, "GET A MEDEVAC! GET ME A MEDEVAC!" BUT DECKER WOULDN'’T--HE WOULDN'’T CALL THE CHOPPERS FOR THE VIETNAMESE. AND WITH ALL THE SHOUTING AND THE MOANING, DECKER WAS SURE THAT OUR POSITION WAS BEING GIVEN AWAY, SO HE WAS GONNA SHOOT BOTH OF '’EM, GIBBY AND THE KID. HE WAS GONNA BLOW '’EM BOTH AWAY. SO I SAID, "NO, NO, NO." AND I WENT ON DOWN THERE. I CRAWLED RIGHT UP THERE BESIDE GIBBY, AND I TOOK OUT MY PISTOL. AND I PUT IT UP AGAINST THE KID IN GIBBY'’S ARMS, AND I... [cries] AND THE MOANING STOPPED. - MATT, I REALLY DON'’T WHY YOU'’RE DOING THIS. - GIBBY STOOD RIGHT UP, LOOKED DOWN AT ME AND WAS GONNA SAY SOMETHING. AND I... WELL, I NEVER WILL KNOW WHAT HE WAS GONNA SAY BECAUSE THE MINUTE HE STOOD UP, AN ENEMY PATROL OPENED UP ON US. THEY MUST'’VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE KIDS OR HEARD US OR SOMETHING. BUT THE MINUTE THEY KNEW WHERE THEY--WHERE WE WERE, THEY OPENED UP ON US, AND KILLED DECKER AND WILL-- ANOTHER GUY FROM MY SQUAD, WILLIE MONROE. HE GOT IT IN THE BACK. AND THEY WERE FIRING ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND GIBBY WAS JUST STANDING THERE, HOLDING THIS DEAD KID IN HIS ARMS. "GET ME A MEDEVAC! GET ME A MEDEVAC!" [cries] - MATT, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US? - OH, I DON'’T KNOW, GAY. I GUESS I JUST WANT YOU TO FEEL AS SICK ABOUT IT AS I DO? - WHY? - BECAUSE YOU WERE PART OF IT, YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HERE. IT WASN'’T JUST ME. WE KILLED THOSE KIDS FOR ALL OF YOU. - MATT, THAT'’S NOT TRUE. A LOT OF US HATED THIS WAR. WE HATED IT FROM THE BEGINNING. - OH, YEAH, SO DID I, JUNE. YOU CAN'’T IMAGINE HOW MUCH I HATED IT. - WELL, IT'’S OVER. - IT'’S NOT OVER! IT'’S NOT OVER! WHY DOES EVERYBODY KEEP SAYING IT'’S OVER? '’CAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT? - MATT, YOU'’RE PUNISHING YOURSELF. YOU'’RE PUNISHING US. I FEEL SO SAD FOR YOU. I'’M SORRY YOU WENT. I'’M SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO DO WHAT YOU DID. BUT I DON'’T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'’RE TRYING TO PUNISH US. - I'’M NOT TRYING TO PUNISH YOU, JUNE. I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. - WELL, IT'’S TOO LATE. IT'’S TOO LATE, SO JUST DROP IT. - OH, I'’M GOOD AT THAT, JUNE. I'’M GOOD AT THAT. - JUNE, HEY. THAT'’S THE SCARY PART. - NED, DON'’T. DON'’T LEAVE. PLEASE, GAY, DON'’T-- - WE'’RE NOT LEAVING, MATT. - IT'’S NOT YOUR FAULT. YOU COULDN'’T HELP WHAT YOU HAD TO DO. - IT'’S NOT THAT. - WHAT IS IT? - YOU KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT I COULD GET BY. I WAS JUST THERE. I DIDN'’T START IT. I COULDN'’T STOP IT. I COULDN'’T CHANGE ANYTHING. I JUST THOUGHT I COULD GET BY. YOU KNOW, JUST DO RIGHT. AND GET BY. BUT I COULDN'’T. [cries] I SHOT THAT LITTLE BOY. HONEY, I DON'’T KNOW, I... I LOST SOMETHING OVER THERE. I DON'’T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT I LOST PART OF ME. AND I'’M NEVER GONNA GET IT BACK. HELL, ELLIE, I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID IF I STARTED CRYING, I'’D NEVER STOP. [cries] - YOU WILL, REALLY. YOU WILL. - [sobbing] - COME IN. I SPENT THE BETTER OF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ON THE PHONE WITH JACK RUSKIN. I'’M SORRY IT HAPPENED, BARNEY. - SIT DOWN. I MANAGED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM ENGAGING ANOTHER LAW FIRM. HE INSISTED YOU BE DROPPED FROM THE CASE, AND I AGREED WITH HIM. - BARNEY, IF HE TESTIFIES IN COURT, I'’M GOING TO THE JUDGE, AND I'’M GONNA TELL HIM WHAT I KNOW ABOUT DE LA TORRE. - MATT, THAT'’S PRIVILEGED INFORMATION. IT CAME TO YOU AS AN ATTORNEY FOR JACK RUSKIN. - I'’LL LET THE JUDGE WORRY ABOUT THAT. - YOU COULD BE DISBARRED FOR VIOLATING A CLIENT'’S CONFIDENCE. - I GUESS I'’LL TAKE THAT CHANCE. - THEN I'’LL HAVE TO ASK FOR YOUR RESIGNATION FROM THE FIRM, MATT. - BARNEY, WHEN YOU CHOOSE WHICH SIDE TO REPRESENT IN A DISPUTE, DOES IT EVER MATTER TO WHICH IS RIGHT AND WHICH IS WRONG? - EVEN PEOPLE WHO DO WRONG ARE ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS, REMEMBER? MATT. RIGHT AND WRONG ARE COMPLICATED QUESTIONS. THEY SEEM SIMPLE SOMETIMES, BUT THEY NEVER ARE. - YOU'’LL HAVE MY RESIGNATION, BARNEY. - FOR THE TRUMPET SHALL SOUND, AND THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED IMPERISHABLY. AND THEN SHALL COME TO PASS THE SAYING THAT IS WRITTEN, "OH, DEATH, WHERE IS THY VICTORY? OH, GRAVE, WHERE IS THY STING?" WE COMMIT THOMAS GIBBS TO HIS FINAL RESTING PLACE IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT IF THIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE BE DISSOLVED, HE HAVE A HOME NOT BUILT BY HANDS ETERNALLY IN THE HEAVENS. AMEN. all: AMEN. - MATT? - OH, HI. - HI. - I CALLED THE AIRPORT. THEY SAID YOU'’D BE LATE. - I WAS. IT IS. - EVERYBODY COME? - YEAH, EVEN HIS EX-WIFE, CASS. - HOW WAS IT? - OH, IT WAS SAD. NOT TOO SAD. I KINDA HAD THE FEELING THAT GIBBY WAS MORE ALIVE AFTER WE BURIED HIM THAN BEFORE. - HOW DO YOU MEAN? - WELL, IT WAS KINDA LIKE PEOPLE COULD REMEMBER HIM THEN; BEFORE THEY WANTED TO FORGET. - KEEP TALKING, WOULD YA? - ABOUT WHAT? - IT DOESN'’T MATTER. I JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. - THAT'’S A DANGEROUS THING TO SAY TO AN UNEMPLOYED LAWYER. - TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU SINCE YOU WERE ABOUT TWO. I WANNA FALL ASLEEP TO YOU TALKING. - IT DOESN'’T START TO GET INTERESTING UNTIL ABOUT THE TIME I MET YOU. - WELL, OKAY, THEN. START THERE.
