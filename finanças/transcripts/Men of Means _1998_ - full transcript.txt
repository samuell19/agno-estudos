Sixty two degrees right now in the Big Apple. So wake up if you have to. Can you believe this? An 86 year old woman who lives in a Buffalo nursing home, won over 6 million dollars in a recent lottery. She actually cashed her check and handed out money to everybody she came across, Nurses and even visitors who were on the floor. Don't you wish you were visiting your granny that day?

[music continues] [funk music] My money. Come on hand it over. I'm in a hurry. I have to make my rounds. What are you, broke Rico? I heard you hit it big at the track the other day. Yeah, I did. So what? Then what do you need the money for? None of your business. Just give me my money and keep your mouth shut. Come on asshole. I'm in a hurry. [Angelo] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you calling "asshole"? You. I'm calling you an asshole because that's what you are. An asshole. [sneezes] [Angelo] Well? Well what? [Angelo] Didn't your mother ever teach you manners, huh? You're supposed to say God bless you when somebody sneezes. I don't believe in saying God bless you. What do you mean you don't believe in saying God bless you? I mean I don't believe in saying God bless you to some son of a bitch who just blew germs all over the room. Screw you is more appropriate, I think. You got plenty of charm, huh? [Rico] Hey, If God wants someone blessed he can come down here and do it himself. [Angelo] You know something Rico? You really are an asshole. Who you calling an asshole? You. I'm calling you an asshole because that's what you are. An asshole. [Angelo] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast, huh? Tommy wants to see you. [Rico] For what? I don't know. Whoa, whoa. He's got somebody in there right now. [Rico] You know Ange? You were stupid in high school and you're stupid now. Nice to achieve something with your life, you know? You would know about that, wouldn't you? Now that's not nice. [punching and groaning] [male voice] I'm sorry! Please, don't hurt me anymore! Get out of here. Get out of here you piece of garbage you. You wanna fuck off with me, Larry? -[Larry] No! No! -Come on! Call me what you did to my face. [Tommy] Tell me to my face, come on. I don't do business that way, you understand? -Did you get my lunch? -[Angelo] Yeah, Tommy. -Where the hell is it? -[Angelo] Yeah, right here. [loud thump] [groans in pain] [Tommy] Go ahead now, get out of here, turd. Get that donkey shit out of here. You! Get your ass in gear. Come on! [Tommy] I got blood all over me from that piece of crap. Rico, I'm gonna get straight to the point. Now, you know me right? I'm not a bad guy. I'm a good guy, ain't I? I mean, I got people who I have to answer to. And when I tell those people that business is good, the last thing that I need, is my people making me look like a liar. Are we on the same page? -Yeah, sure Tommy. -Yeah, OK. Well, maybe you can tell me why word on the street has it that you ain't putting pressure on people like you used to. Where did you hear that? [Tommy] What difference does it make? I heard it. The point is that you have to straighten yourself out. When Tommy C hires a guy to collect money for him, he expects him to lay down the law. Plain and simple. No dicking around. Alright. Is that clear? You got that point? -I always have Tommy. -Oh, good. Okay. Then maybe you can explain to me unless of course your skimming why Jerry Trask's envelope only had half a payment in last week's collection money? He was short so I cut him a break. That's all. Ohh... he was a little short. So you cut him a break. Is that what you're telling me? You do not cut guys breaks. You give them until twelve noon the next day. If they haven't paid you by then I expect a major part of their body to be in a cast, preferably their dick! Come on Tommy. He'll come through. He's a good guy. Oh, oh. He's a good guy. Oh. Isn't that funny? I'm not in the good guy business. This is not a charity I'm running here. [Tommy] You know, I've been in this business a long time. Been a lot of guys come and go A lot of things go down. Some guys, they get tired. They get burnt out. Sometimes... they do some things that are stupid. Mike's here Tommy. [Tommy] Tell him to come on in. Go ahead, get the hell out of here. [jazz music] Hey Rico! Rico! How are you doing? Hey little bro! What are you doing here? I saw your car. Figured you were up seeing Tommy. How did it go? Ah, you know Tommy. He ragged on me. -Nothing I can't handle. -He got anything for me yet? Nothing but driving. You know Joey, I was going to come by and get you. Yeah, I saw Angelo dragging Larry the Lizard out a couple of minutes ago. [chuckling] He insulted Tommy. It's not a good idea. [Joey] Ah, man! I could handle a loser like that. All Tommy has to do is say the word and let me in. Boom! I would come through for him. Ain't that simple, Joey. [laughing] Come on! If Tommy would let me pack some heat, he could sit back, watch the Brothers Burke tame his streets for him, eh? -Bang! Bang! Bang! -Hey, cut that shit out. What? [keys jingle] Hey, maybe you can talk to Tommy for me! [Rico] Don't start Joey. OK? [Joey] What do you mean? [Rico] Don't start is what I mean. [Joey] That's easy for you to say. You get to do real work. Real work. Yeah. [rustling noise] From Tommy. I don't know why Tommy keeps giving me these handouts just for driving you around. I mean, what am I? A cab driver or something? Hey, don't push it. OK? I could do other things. You just don't trust me no more. Joey I told you, it ain't like that. Tommy thinks it looks better if two guys pull up in a car. It's all about appearances. You know? It makes more of a statement. [Rico] Now come on, let's go. [engine starts] [funky music] [Joey] What are you waiting for? This is your last stop. That Trask guy. [banging] -[Trask] Who is it? -[Rico] Rico Burke. [kicking] [Rico] You should seriously consider redecorating this dump, Jerry. If I could afford to redecorate, I wouldn't have to worry about putting my kid through school. Yeah and if I listened to everyone's sob story I'd shoot myself at the end of the day. Sorry. We all have our crosses. Yeah? Keep yours to yourself. There you go. Tommy wants last week's as well, Jerry. But you said it would be alright. I know what I said, but Tommy said different, Jerry. [sighs nervously] Well I don't have it. You know, you should've thought about your daughter before you borrowed money, Jerry. Please don't hurt me, Rico. I can't afford to be laid up. [violent punching] Please! I can't-- [yells in pain] [gasps] I can't let her down! [screams] [gasping] [screams] [Trask gasping] The money... Last week's, next week's... [Trask] I can get it all. Pay off Tommy for good. That sounds like a crock to me, Jerry. [Trask] Please! Please! I swear it, I swear it! My cousin offered it to me. I didn't want to take it but I will if I have to! [gasping] Noon. Noon tomorrow, Jerry. If you don't have the-- look at me... Noon tomorrow. If you don't have the money or if I have to or if I have to come looking for you I will beat you within inches of your life. Do you understand me? [Trask cries out] [soft piano music] [Rico sighs] I've become an animal, Joey. Give me that money I gave you before. For what? Just give it to me. I'll give it back to you tomorrow. [Joey] You're padding envelopes, Rico. Just worry about driving. [Joey] Tommy ain't gonna like it if he finds out you're padding envelopes, letting people slide. Yeah. Well Tommy ain't gonna find out, is he? Let's go. [Angelo] Hey, did you see the picture of Lizzy Moran -in today's Post? -[Rico] No, I must've missed it. [Angelo] Well, I'll tell ya, she is some looker, this broad. Yeah, she's alright. What do you mean she's alright? Just what I mean. She's alright. It's what I mean. You saying that if she crawled into bed with you and started playing with your balls, you'd kick her out? Angelo! A girl, any girl would have to be pretty sorry looking for me to throw her out when she's already in my bed. [Rico] But wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hey, up yours! I'm married. That's exactly what I'm talking about. I thought I had a big dick until your wife showed me hers. Whoa! Hey, screw you, Rico. Alright. Take care. I'll call you later, alright? Be careful. [Tommy] Not bad huh, Rico? Bet you wouldn't mind having a little piece of that yourself, would you? I don't know Tommy. Give unto Caesar, you know what I mean? [chuckles] [Tommy] What are you gonna do, start preaching now? Come on. Bring me my money. [Tommy] Now, let's see what we got here. Jerry Trask, alright. Now, that's last week's. And this is this week's. That's very good. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This money looks familiar. Angelo! [Angelo] Yeah, Tommy? Did you pay Rico today? [Angelo] Yeah, sure I did. [Tommy] Did you copy down the serial numbers like I told you? [Angelo] Yeah. [Tommy] Come here. -[Rico] Hey, Tommy, I-- -[Tommy] My goodness! You playing some kind of game? Do you think my business is some kind of a joke? [Rico] Hey, Tommy. It don't got to be like this. -Come on man-- -Yes, yes. It's got to be like this, you know why? Because you asked for it by trying to put one over on me. [trigger clicks] I should blow your brains out. Do you know that? It would be my right. [suspenseful music] The only thing that's saving you is all the money I won on your back when you were in college playing football. You remember that? Rico "Bullet" Burke, star quarterback. Look at you now, look at you. You are nothing. You'll never be anything. You're a two-bit loser with a bad arm and a bad record. Although it did take a little nerve to try to put one over on Tommy, huh? Well, we're gonna see how much nerve you really got. You're going to go back and see Mr. Trask. You're gonna pay him a little visit, okay? And you're gonna collect the money. [knife clicks] All the money! His money, not yours. Okay? And if he ain't got the money, all of it, you are gonna cut off one of his fingers. [stabbing noise] [ominous music] Now, I don't give a shit what finger you cut off. I mean me, personally, I prefer the pinky. This way he can keep his job and still pay the debt. And let me tell you something else. I don't want that retarded gimp hanging around here anymore. Now, you understand? He's giving my business a bad name. What am I running? A home here? I'd appreciate you not talking about my brother like that-- What! Okay, come on Tommy. You don't have to talk about my brother like that. [Tommy] Hey, I call them as I see them. If it wasn't for that kind of a scumbag my gambling joint wouldn't be down! It was running one of your crooked tables -that got him shot. -Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Angelo] Watch it, Rico. Yeah, take it easy. You already got one foot in the grave. [Tommy] You realize that, don't you? I'm gonna call this an unfortunate situation. I'm gonna make believe this never happened. We're gonna go back to business as usual. [Tommy] Okay? [trigger clicks] [Tommy] Now go get them Rico. Go get them. And Rico? If you're not back here with the money or his finger by eight o'clock tonight, I'm coming after both of you. Now get out of here. Go ahead. [grunts] Hey what's the matter? That low-life bastard. [Joey] What happened? What did Tommy do? [Rico] One of these days Joey, I'm gonna cap him right between the eyes. [Joey] Hey, hey. Talk like that will only get you killed. I can't help it. Taking on Tommy C is not a game people win, Rico. I want one break, that's it! Just one chance to get out from underneath him! Come on, move it out. We're going back to Jerry Trask's. [engine starts] [folk music] [loud thud] Deal's off, Jerry. Tommy wants his money now. -Right now! -But I don't have it yet! -I can't-- -[Rico] Time to look out for number one. [Trask grunts] [lamp smashes] Rico, wait! It's too late for talking Jerry. [knife clicks] [Trask] I'm gonna get the money tonight. [slamming drawer] [yelling] Rico, I swear. Me and a couple guys are gonna pull a job tonight! Take your hand off my wrist or I'll slit your throat Jerry. I swear! The job is worth 200 grand! The Del Ray warehouse. Do you know it? Yeah, what about it? [Trask] Okay. There's a buy going down at 8:30. Counterfeit plates, twenties. [Rico] Who has those Jerry? Some Koreans looking to make quick cash outside -their own circle. -Who's buying Jer? [Trask grunts] Louis. The Turk? Tommy would kill them for that. [Trask] He's looking to break away from Tommy. Ain't we all? [whispers] It's true. Where would a low-life like you get that information, Jerry? [grunts] This partner of mine, Roy, he works for Louis. There's a spot above his office you can hear everything from. Lou's been planning this for weeks. [Sammy] Hey, Jerry! You here? [Trask] Sammy! He's got a gun! [gunshots] [loud crash] [glass shattering] [gunshots continue] [neighbor] Keep it down in there! [folk music continues] [trigger clicks] [gunshots] [thud] [Rico] Come on! Let's go! Hey, I don't know if I was just dreaming but I thought I heard gunshots. [Rico] Some kids playing with firecrackers in the stairway. Nice building. [Joey chuckles] Listen, I gave Tommy a call when we were upstairs. Joey. A job's come up. You want in, you're in -but we gotta move on it now. -What kind of job? Lou the Turk is trying to move counterfeit plates behind Tommy's back and we're going to stop him. -And Tommy wants me? -No, I want you. But you have to make up your mind right now Joe. Are there going to be guns? Yeah, and we're probably going to have to use them. -Right on! Right on! -Hey, cut that out! -What? -Your attitude! This ain't no schoolyard. [whining] I know that Rico. No, I don't think you do Joe. I don't think you know that. This is the real deal. Now look! You're going in there with me. You keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. No games. You do what I say. You got that? Yeah Rico. I got it. I got it. [laughs excitedly] Where to? Del Ray warehouse. Wait a minute. I want to stop somewhere. Where? I want to see mom. -Yeah? -Yeah. [engine starts] [Joey] You know I hate coming out here. What gives? [Rico] All these damn bugs. It's a cemetery. What did you expect? The place is full of bugs. We should've taken better care of her Joe. Yeah, sure. -Hey, what are ya doing, huh? -What? Show some respect! You're losing it man. It's mom's grave. She's my mom too. Who do you think you are hitting me, huh? My old man? [soft piano music] What do you think mom would say about all the things I've done, Joey? [Joey] I don't know. [Rico] I'm going to do whatever I have to Joey. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get away from this miserable life. Otherwise, I've got a feeling my days are numbered. [Rico] Come on, we've got work to do. Let's get out of here. [blues music] -[son] Hey Dad, can we watch TV? -[daughter] Daddy? No son, I'm listening to the stereo. -Come on! Our show's almost on. -[daughter] Please, please... Yeah, but son, this is real music. This is rhythm and blues, R&B. This guy's a real master. -Daddy, daddy, TV-- -Aw, for crying out loud! Look what ya did! You got it all over me. Mom! What happened? What happened? She spilled the drink all over me, the rug. Try to give these kids culture. They don't wanna take it. Well, they're kids. They wanna watch TV. They don't wanna listen to your stupid music. [Tommy] Hey, watch your mouth. That's not stupid music. That's soul! Screw soul! [loud slap] [Nancy cries out] Now you had to open your mouth and spoil my whole night! Now where you going? Get back here for crying out loud! Get back here! You're an animal Tommy! [Tommy] Hey watch your mouth in front of my kids. Go to your room, go ahead! Lock yourself up, go ahead! all of you. [blues music] Show time. [Tommy] Hey, Angelo. Yeah, it's eight o'clock. Did you hear from Rico? No? Well get over here. What do you mean why? We're gonna go look for him, that's why. -You getting in? -What is this? It's a car. I know it's a car. Who's car is it? [Angelo] It's the wife's. She needed mine to go over to her mother's house. To tell you the truth, I think the power steering on this thing is shot. Well, if you think I'm getting into this piece of crap, you're out of your mind. -[Angelo stutters] Wha-- -[Tommy] What's with the... What are you, an idiot? Get out. We'll take my car. [briefcase snaps] [suspenseful music] [Joey] Let's go! [Rico whistles] [triggers click] [gunshots] [man groans] [man grunts] [Pete] Let's finish them off! Hey, those are Tommy's guys! Yeah, yeah, I know. [gunshots] [Rico] Hey! [applauding] Way to go boys! Hey, Burke! What the hell are you doing here? Tommy sent me. He thought you might need an extra gun. Obviously, he was wrong. It ain't like Tommy to change places at the last minute. [briefcase snaps echo] Two against six. On paper those are pretty stiff odds. Don't you think? I don't know. I don't like the smell of this. Hey look. How else would I know what you were doing unless Tommy told me. Well, why don't we call Tommy and ask him? You know that's probably a good idea. [gun trigger clicks] Why don't we? You shoot Mike, I shoot you. [Pete] Tommy still gets the goods. [Rico chuckles] I guess we got ourselves a situation here, huh? [Cop 1] Freeze! [Mike] Does it look like anyone's moving over here, you asshole? Huh? [laughs] [Cop 2] Drop your weapons! [Rico] Oh yeah! Like that's gonna happen! Joey! [Cop 1] That's good son! Now, move away from the others. [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [Joey groaning] -[Rico] Let's see. -How does it look? Looks like it went in and out. How does it feel? It hurts! How the hell do you think it feels? Look at me Joe. [Rico] Okay. You're alright. I'm gonna get you out. Come on, let's go. [Joey groans] Every time I get a real job I get shot. -Let's see we got here Joey. -[Joey moaning] [Joey] Come on... [Rico] Joey, wait here. Just hang on, alright? -Okay, you ready? Here we go. -[Joey groaning] [Rico] Now, we're out of here. [Rico] We'll stop as soon as we put some distance behind us. We should call Tommy. Yeah right. That's one thing we're not doing. Why not? [Rico] Cause, in case you ain't figured it out we just fucked up one of Tommy's jobs and took something that he probably thinks belongs to him right now. [Joey] But they belong to Tommy, don't they? Hey, don't they? No. Belongs to us. I thought you would've figured that out. Damn it, Rico! What did you go and have to do that for? [Rico] It was a way to get out from underneath him with a means of living decently. How many times are we gonna get a shot at money like this, huh? [Joey] You could've at least let me in on it! Oh yeah! And you would've went for it? No fucking way! It's suicide! Brothers are supposed to look out for one another. You just sent us a death sentence. Thanks a lot! You got things twisted, little brother. Yeah? What do you call lying to me? There was no reason to screw Tommy! Tommy's been good to us! Tommy's been good to us? -Tommy's been good to us? -Yeah! Tommy's never done shit for us! [Joey moans] [Rico] He's treated me like a piece of shit since I first started working for him, and you worse! You wanna know something? You wanna know about those handouts? They didn't come from Tommy, they came out of my pocket! -Bullshit! -He never gave you a dime! He never asked about you once after you got shot. You know that? Running his own back alley casino -and he never asked once! -[Joey crying] Don't tell me what a bust out guy Tommy C is. He's a lowlife cocksucker. He's always been! -It just took me too long- -[Joey] Shut up! [loud slapping] Hey, take it easy! Calm down! You're acting like a kid, you know that? That's why I could never talk to Tommy about you. -Shut up! -I'm warning you! I'm warning you! [loud punch] [Rico] Why do you make me do that? Huh? Why can't you take it easy? -[Joey whimpers] -I'm sorry, alright. -Look, I'm sorry. -[Joey crying] [Joey] What are we going to do now, Rico? [Rico] Survive. That's one thing I know how to do is survive. [soft jazz music] Looks like somebody was here with bad intentions. Oh, yeah, definitely very bad intentions. Numb nuts, you wanna close that door? Check out those two guys. [Trask grunts] Well, Jerry. You are not looking too good, my friend. [Trask sighs] Who's that? [Trask] My daughter. Ah! Now that's something. I like that. No, I respect that. [glass shattering] Here you are dying, and the last thing you're reaching for is family. That's nice. That's very nice. See, myself, I would have been reaching for something to throw at the guy who just shot me. You know? But different strokes, different folks, right? No! [coughs] What? The picture? [Trask coughs] Leave her alone! Ah, Jerry come on! if you don't like the rules, don't play the game. See a debt is a debt. Now for all I know, you have been sending all my money to her. [coughs] Leave her alone! Alright, alright, alright. Now just tell me one thing. Who did all of this? Was it Rico? Yep. Bingo. Well I'll be damned. Well Rico, you never finish anything you start. [Trask cries out and groans] Hey, Tommy! Come and check this out. [Tommy] Well, what have we got here? -This. -The Del Ray warehouse. That little scumbag. He was planning the same rip off as me. The nerve! Remind me to kill him again on the way out. [electric drilling] [bell clangs] [smashing noise] [Joey sobbing] [Rico] Take it easy. Relax. [man grunts] [Rico] Okay. Let's get a look at it now. Okay? Just gonna look. [Rico] Hey, hey, look at that. Went right through. I cut myself worse shaving Joe. [Joey] That's not funny! [Rico] Hey, it's bleeding, but it's not gushing. If it hit something serious, you would know it. Remember the last time, right? [Joey] Tommy's gonna kill us. You know that don't you? [Rico] He has no way of knowing it was us. Move your hands. He has no way of knowing it was us. Mike and Pete are both dead, so's Trask. -[Joey] You killed Trask, too? -Yeah and two of his partners. [Joey] You're just full of surprises tonight. What now? [Rico] We head out to the Jersey shore. Hide out with Max a day, maybe two. Then Mexico. You ready? This is gonna hurt, Joe. [Joey screaming] [Rico] Take it easy. Alright, that's it. Now listen Joe. Listen, we got the money right? But we got the plates too. Until Tommy finds us. He ain't gonna find us. Not if we keep moving. [Joey crying] He has to Rico. If Tommy doesn't do us, they're gonna send somebody to do him. Joe, listen to me. One or two days, then we're out of here. Hold this. Home free little brother. Okay? Come on, it's not so bad. You're gonna be fine. That's it. That's it. Try to calm down Joey. Calm down. Everything will be fine. [Tommy] Listen to me, and listen to me good. Don't think for one second that I've been supporting your family all these years just so that you could join the force and forget all about me. [cop] Uncle Tommy. -I can't tell you anything. -Come on, come on! -Tommy... -Hey! Look at me. Look at me when I talk to you. I will fuck with your career, big time. Okay! Alright. We got eight other bodies up there. Lou, Mike, Pete, plus a few Koreans and a couple of guys they haven't I.D.'d yet. -Was Rico Burke one of them? -Burke? No. Alright, thanks kid. I'll buy your mother something really nice. [police radio chatter] [blues music] -[Tommy] Angelo! -[Angelo] Yeah? [Tommy] Get a couple of guys. Go over to Rico's place. I don't think he's stupid enough to show up, but do it anyhow. And also his brother's. [Angelo] You got it. [Tommy] And go across the street to the carpet joint. I want this faxed to Philly, Boston, AC, Baltimore and any the other places where Trask may have hung out. Somebody there may recognize his daughter. -Yeah, sure thing. -And don't lose it! Yeah, I won't. I won't. I'm gonna put the word out on the wire. Rico's gonna have to show up sooner or later somewhere. And I wanna know about it when he does. -Alright, go ahead, take off. -You got it. [rock music] [Rico] Alright, I'm gonna go in and get Max. Okay? [Joey] I'm gonna stay here. [blues music] Get lost on your way to Atlantic City? I'm looking for Max. Is he around? No. You're Rico Burke, aren't you? Been a long time since a pretty face recognized me. What are you, some sort of a sports buff? That figures. Well, Max talks about you a lot. I feel like I coached you myself. Hey, who are you? [Cleo] Cleo. Cleo Wynn. I help Max out around here. Oh yeah, how? You know. Tending bar, keeping books. That sort of thing. [Rico] You know, Max doesn't usually take to new faces. You must've done something to make him trust you. [Cleo] Listen cowboy, before you stick your foot in it, Max and my father go way back. He gave me a job here so I could earn a few bucks for school. Hey, it's just that I've never seen you around before. Okay? Yeah well, I've been here two years. [Rico] Two years? I guess I haven't seen Max in a while. Yeah, well you don't phone or write either. [Cleo] You're like the son he never had. He always did have a soft spot for smart asses, didn't he? Funny. He likes you. Look, could we just skip this and tell me where he is? He's visiting his sister in Baltimore. He'll be back in the morning. What's wrong? Hey, look. -I've got a bit of a problem. -[Cleo] Problem. Yeah, my brother Joey. Max knows him. He's out in the car. He's hurt. Hurt how? Hurt in the way that I can't take him to a doctor. At least not one I don't know really well. What do you want me to do? If Max were here, I'd be asking him to put me up, right now. Well, he's not here. Yeah, I know. We already covered that. You have a wonderful way of endearing yourself to people. Excuse me, I'm a little high strung right now. Okay? Look, it's just I don't think Max would like me letting you up to his place, seeing he's away and all. Hey, Come on. It's me Bullet Burke. Max talks about me all the time. You said it yourself. Come on, help me out. Alright, alright. It's against my better judgment, but fine. Take your brother up the side stairs. I'll meet you there. Cleo. I owe you one. Hey Raphael! Do you mind watching the bar for me for a couple of minutes? [Raphael] Okay. Keep an eye on the two guys in the corner. Alright? Just lean on me, lean on me. [Joey panting] -[Joey] Oh, good! Stairs! -[Rico chuckles] [Rico] There we go. [Joey] I'm feeling a lot better. -[Joeys groans] -[Rico] You could use some sun. [Cleo] You sure, he doesn't need a doctor? [Rico] Listen, Cleo. There's a first aid kit in the kitchen. Could you get that please? Listen to me. Give me your coat. Give me your coat. Watch out. There we go, there we go. You're alright. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'd put that foot up. [grunts] Hey! You treat it like a baby's ass, not a side of beef! There's gratitude! Who's the broad? Broad? I don't see any broad! Hey give him a break. He's been shot. Okay? [Joey] That's it Rico! Don't you take any crap. [loud slap] Hey you shut up, huh? What are you hitting me for? Ain't it enough you got me shot? [Rico] Alright. Come on, quiet down! We're getting off on the wrong foot here. Cleo, this is my brother, Joey. Joey, this is Cleo. She's Max's friend. Now be nice. Pleased to meet you. I just want to know if I should expect the police anytime soon? No, I don't think so. -Somebody else then? -No. Would someone care to tell me what this is all about? Well it all started with a horse. A horse. [Rico] Yeah, a horse. As in horse racing? You see, Joey and I, we had in our possession a certain piece of information. You mean a fix. [Rico] Exactly. Now, not particularly being friends with the guys who own the horse, we bet heavy to drive down the odds, right? Well, the horse race goes off as planned, the horse wins as planned, blah, blah, blah. Before you know it, the guns come out and here we are. [Cleo laughs] -What? -[Cleo] Every word of that sounds like you made it up as you went along. -It's God's honest truth. -[Cleo] Uh-huh. So what makes you think these guys are not going to show up? [Rico] Ah, you know, all that gun play, that was just like a heat of the moment thing. It'll all blow over in a couple of days. Well, Max will be here in the morning and then you'll be his problem. Meanwhile, I got a bar to run. Is he going to be all right? Yeah. [Rico] In the morning, he'll feel like dying but he'll live. He'll definitely live. Hello, excuse me. I'm in the room here. Just shut up! You're making it bleed. Well, I'll knock three times on the ceiling -in case we're surrounded. -[Joey] Oh, ha, ha, ha! -Oh hey, Cleo. -Hmm? Thanks a lot. I mean it. What now? Thanks a lot, I mean it? What's your problem, huh? I saw the way you were looking at her! What are you talking about? I thought you were gonna knock me off the couch with that hard-on of yours. Hey. She's a little young for me, don't you think? She's young, but not that young. You know, a lot of help you are. Remind me next time you get shot. I'll just leave you there. You can't do that! We're brothers. Brothers? Next time I shoot you myself. How's that? [dialing tone] [ringing] -[Manny] Hello? -[Rico] Manny! -[Manny] Yeah? -[Rico] How are you doing? -[Manny] Good. -[Rico] Hey, listen. I found myself up in your neck of the woods with something you might find kind of interesting. -[Manny] Oh yeah. What is it? -Plates. -[Manny] Plates? -As in 20 dollar plates. -[Manny] Are they in good shape? -Yeah. Top of the line. [Manny] Good. Call me tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -[Manny] Yeah, Rico. Tomorrow. Okay, Manny. I'll talk to you tomorrow. [phone clicks off] -What? -[Rico] If he can't find someone to take them, he's going to take them. Either way, with that money and what we got man, we've got it made! We're set, Brother! Hey, where are you going? To get the briefcases, dummy. What do you think? [funk music] Oh, nice hiding place. Hey, if Tommy C shows up these bags will be the least of our worries. [Joey] You got that right. [Rico] Come on. I'm gonna get you into bed. Ow! [car horn honking] -Anything? -Nah, nothing yet. Well, all we can do now is wait. That's all. Hey, look Tommy. It's late. Maybe we should go home. I mean, people know where to reach us, right? Yeah, alright. I'll be right there. Go ahead. You go. Alright. Hey, Tom. Rico's bound to turn up tomorrow, right? [claps] Yeah. [Rico] Joe. It's not bleeding anymore. It'll be fine, okay? So just try and get some rest. -[Joey] Yeah... -Give me that cigarette. [Joey] No. You know this is great, just great! Rico. Rico you son of a bitch. You scumbag! [smashing noises] [soft music] Too late for a drink? Help yourself. How's Joey? He's alright. He's asleep. He'll be fine. You know, you're pretty cavalier about all this. Hey, I've been around. It doesn't help any when you get upset. [Cleo laughs] You know, I kind of lied before. I am a bit of a sports buff. [giggles] Believe it or not, I still have that cover of that big sports magazine. [Rico chuckles] Really? [Cleo laughs] Yeah. My dad used to watch you on the tube every Saturday. He said you were the best on the field. [both laugh] And you? Absolutely. Yeah, I don't know about all that stuff. Besides, it was a long time ago. [Cleo] Come on, didn't you know what you had back then? You know, don't realize all that stuff until after you've made a few mistakes. Well, you obviously haven't learned your lesson. What is that supposed to mean? The story about the horse race. [Rico] What about it? I saw you out the window Rico. I don't think those two briefcases were carrying your spare undies. What? So I'm supposed to tell you the truth? Is that it? Fine. Fine. Joey and I ripped off some counterfeit plates. [Rico] In the other bag is the buy money. And if ya wanna know the whole story Joey got shot by a couple of wise guys who had the same idea as us. Okay, are you happy? Yeah, but you wound up with the plates and the money. I can be lucky. I bet. Goodnight dear. That's right! Run away! You were given opportunities people like me only dream about and you just threw them away. Oh, that's what this is all about. I'm supposed to apologize to every hard luck case I meet because I screwed up as a kid, huh? No! This is about you and what you were. "Bullet Burke." You know. The guy people used to look up to. [laughs] And now, I'm sorry to say, the guy that I had a big crush on. Goodnight. The world don't owe you a thing Rico. You got to work hard to get something out of life. Nothing comes easy. If there's one thing I have learned, it's that. Nothing comes easy. [beads rustle] [broom swishing] [soft piano music] [Rico] Hey, Max. I thought you were visiting your sister! [door closes] [Max] What's this Cleo tells me about Joey? We were pulling a job. He got winged by one of Tommy C's men. Tommy C! You got no business being around him Rico. He was no good from the day he was born. Come on Max. You know he was hiring. I needed work. That's no excuse. -[Max] How's Joey? -He'll be alright. You call a doctor? [Rico] No. The wound is clean enough. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm sure Max. [Max] Seeing how he's in my bed, that leaves the floor or couch. [thud] And I'm not sleeping on the floor. You know, I think I'll sleep on the floor. [Max] Rico. You can't go on like this! I've slept on a lot of floors, Max. [Max] Don't be so smart! I'm not talking about the floor. I'm talking about this wise guy life. [Max] It's gonna catch up with you sooner or later. Max, I just had this conversation with the girl downstairs. Okay? She was right. [Rico] And like I told her, it's over, man! Me and Joey have enough money to start a whole new life, Max. Dirty money! Don't you think Tommy C's gonna come after you? It's gonna take him a long time to figure out if we're involved. By then we're gonna be far away. And if he doesn't stop looking? If he happens to find you? I'll deal with that when, and if, I have to. [romantic music] Where are you going? I'm gonna go and apologize to Miss Cleo, Okay? Come on Max. [gentle slap] Don't be mad at me. Mad at you? [gentle slap] Go on, get out of here. Ho! [Rico] Cleo? I should apologize for that stuff I said earlier. I guess... you hit a nerve. I guess. Come on, don't make this any tougher than it already is. You know, I'm kinda new at it. Okay. Apology accepted. Good night. Maybe we just got off to a bad start. You should give me another chance, you know? I've had a rotten day. If you're going to hold a grudge I may just throw myself into -the ocean and drown. -Oh, don't be melodramatic. Melodrama was my major before I screwed up. -[Cleo laughs] -Guess I'm not such a bad guy. No. I'm just a sucker for a nice smile. Me too. Where are you going? Beach. -The beach? -[Cleo giggles] Yeah, the beach. It's dark. There's nothing on the beach. I know. That's why I like it. [Cleo] I'd say it's pure luck you could get past me -with this football. -[Rico laughs] Hey, I'm Bullet Burke. I'll leave footprints in the back of your head. [Cleo] You'll just have to cut little ole me some slack. -[Cleo] One hand touch. -[Rico] Deal. [soft music] -I want to teach. -What do you want to teach? I want to teach kids. That's nice. And you go to school full time? No. My dad's coming tomorrow. He's got some big plans about how he's gonna send me full time. [Rico] Hup! [Cleo] Hey! That is not fair. You distracted me. [Rico] That's the nature of the game. You wouldn't believe some of the things I used to say to throw the other guys off. That's poor sportsmanship if you ask me. Aw, don't be a sore loser. Well we all can't be winners like you. Come on Cleo. I didn't mean anything by that! Things are tough enough without you making a crack like that. Cleo! Come on! What is all this? [Cleo screams and laughs] Oh, you little... [both laughing] Are you alright? That's the nature of the game, baby. [romantic music] [Cleo] It's late. I'd better be getting home. My dad's coming, so I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be here. You know, I think you two will have a lot in common. [engine grinds] That doesn't sound too good. I know. It takes a couple of tries to turn her over. I think you better pop the hood. [Cleo] What? You know about cars? Here. Get my tools, they're in the trunk. Uh-huh. [Rico] What a mess. [Cleo] So you never said. Was it the money? -[Rico] Oh, in college? -[Cleo] Yeah. [Rico] Nah. I didn't care much about that stuff then. In fact, after my mom died, I stopped caring about everything. Sometimes things get out of control. I know. [laughs] When my father lost everything playing numbers, Mom left him and school became a dream. Sounds like both our dads were "Father of the Year" candidates. Look, don't get me wrong. I mean the man definitely has his faults, but... there's one thing that can never be said [laughs] and that is Jerry Trask's heart isn't in the right place. Jerry Tra-- Your father's name is Jerry Trask? Yeah. You know him? He lives up near you. No, I don't know him. It's just that... you told me your name was Wynn. That's my mother's. After all she's the one that raised me. [chuckles] What's wrong? I know your father, Cleo. Really? Isn't it a small world. [Rico] He's dead. Dead. Wait a minute. [laughs nervously] Wait a minute. I would've heard. The police would've phoned. It happened just a few hours ago. How do you know? [Rico] The counterfeit plates. He was part of the set up before it went bad. I don't believe you! He never would have been -involved with stuff like that. -No. It's true, Cleo. He was doing it for you. All he ever talked about was doing right by you. I swear to God. There's... How? How did it happen? Tommy C. The same guy responsible for Joey. Get away from me. Cleo! Cleo, what are you doing? You don't understand Tommy. You're blood. He's gonna hold you responsible for the debt. [Cleo yells] Save it, Rico! I don't want anything to do -with your world. -He's gonna turn your world -upside down! -[Cleo yelling] I said, save it! Come with me and Joey to Mexico. [laughing] Oh God. Are you for real? It's not safe for you here, Cleo! -Listen to me! -You get the fuck away from me! Where are you going, huh? Cleo? [Cleo] Somewhere you can't. Atlantic City. Atlantic City! Cleo, they know my car! What's the matter with you. This isn't going to work! [engine grinds] [Rico]Cleo! [Rico] get out of the-- Cleo! Listen to me. They know my car! Cleo! [blues guitar music] So, did you win or lose tonight? What's it to you? [laughing] Hey, I just get concerned. See a pretty young lady walking along, looking like her dog just got shot. Well, I don't have a dog. Just trying to make conversation. A little talk, a little less gambling might've saved your old man. [laughs] Life's funny, ain't it? I mean first they come by and give me your picture. Next thing I know, bang! You're walking by the hotel. [Cleo cries out] Listen. Don't make this hard. There's someone in New York who wants to talk to you. -[Cleo gasps] -[stranger] That's all. [Rico] Psst! [Rico] Psst! [gunshot] [Cleo] Rico! [gunshot] Cleo, jump! [Rico whispers] Come on. Keep your head down. [gunshots continue] [suspenseful music] [Rico] Hang on! Hang on! -[Rico] You got the keys? -Yeah. -Start the car. Come on! -Aw, great! [thug] Nice work, Burke! Like you weren't in enough fucking trouble! [gunshots] [car horn honking] [glass shatters] [tires squealing] [Cleo] Don't say I told you so. Well I did, didn't I? [gunshots continue] [screeching tires] [horns honking] [screeching tires continue] Locking the trunk would have been nice. I did, but I don't think car chases were high on the designer's priority list. [gunshots] [crashing noise] [loud explosions] What are you doing? Going through the window! -No! -Hey, relax! [Rico] No! Cleo! No! No! No! [Cleo screams] [glass shattering] Where did you learn to drive like this? Beginner's luck. Great. [crashing noises] [tires squealing] [loud explosion] [gunshots] [loud punch] [crashing noise] [glass shatters] Women drivers! [birds chirping] [Angelo] Thanks a lot! [Tommy] The cab that just pulled away? Oh that. The heap finally broke down. Where's your car? The wife wanted it again. I told her no, but she got mad. She got mad? What are you a man or a mouse? [Angelo] Hey, what can I do? [Tommy] Hey, I knew you were stupid. I just didn't think you were a wuss too! [Tommy] Let's go. [engine starts] [Angelo] Where to? [Tommy] Atlantic City. Atlantic City? Tommy, I told the wife I'd be home for lunch. [Tommy] What is it with you and food? What? I like to eat. [Tommy] I can see that. [Angelo] What's so important in A.C. anyhow? [Tommy] Rico was spotted with Trask's daughter. They were running around like Bonnie and Clyde. [Angelo] Rico, huh? Maybe he went down to visit Max. What? Max. You know, the old high school coach? [Tommy] Yeah, I remember the old geezer. What about him? Well, he owns a bar near Atlantic City. Rico used to visit him down there all the time. They're real tight. You knew this all along? Yeah, I guess. -Stop the car. -Huh? Stop the fucking car! What? You are a piece of work. You know that? What did I do now? What did you do now? Last night I'm climbing walls trying to find Rico and today you just pop up out of the blue and you tell me maybe he went down to see Max? Huh? Well, I didn't know it was that important! Get out of the car. Get out? Get out of the fucking car! How am I supposed to get home? Walk! Maybe the exercise will do you good. [Tommy] You fat tub of shit. [phone dialing] [phone rings] -[Nick] Hello? -[Tommy] Yeah. Hello Nick. -Yeah, it's Tommy C. -[Nick] Yeah, Tommy. [Tommy] Listen, you got a joint down there owned by a guy named Max. It's around your neighborhood. -Do you know it? -[Nick] Yeah. [Tommy] You do? Hold on, hold on a sec, wait. -Okay. Shoot. -[Nick] Sea Coaster Lounge. [Tommy] The Sea Coaster Lounge. Now where is that? How do I get there? [Tommy] Okay. Yeah, I know where that is. -[Nick] On the north side. -[Tommy] Yeah. No problem. [Tommy] Thanks a lot. Okay, Nicky, bye-bye. [Tommy whistles] Get in the car! You just threw me out. Get in the car! -We still going to Jersey? -Yeah. -[Angelo] Atlantic City? -It's near there. [Angelo] Maybe we can check out a show? Shut up and drive the car. Do me a favor. Go. [seagulls cawing] [soft music] Cleo? Look. I only got a couple of hours to get rid of these plates then it's really gonna hit the fan. You seriously have to consider coming away with me. Go by yourself. I'll give you the money. But you can't stay here any longer. Mexico you said. [Angelo] Honey, honey. I don't know. I don't know. We're still about an hour from where we're going. [Angelo's wife] How long is it gonna be? I don't know how long. [Angelo] We got business to take care of. [Angelo] Yeah, business! [Angelo's wife] When are you coming home? Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow. [Angelo] I don't know when! I don't know! Listen, honey. He just told you. He has business to take care of. End of conversation. Have a nice day. Aw Tommy, now she's really gonna be mad at me. [Tommy] Hey, you know what your problem is? You didn't break your wife in right. You know that? You have to learn to keep your woman in line. And how do you do that? [Tommy] You have to play a good cop, bad cop kinda thing. You understand? But you have to know when to hit them and when not to. Come on Tommy, I don't wanna hit her. [Tommy] Hey, suit yourself. I'm telling you, that every once in a while, when they act up, a couple raps up the side of the head straightens them right out. -I don't know about that. -[Tommy] Hey, trust me. I know about marriage. I am on my third one. [pigeons cooing] [birds chirping] Cleo tells me you invited her to go to Mexico with you. Yeah. She has to go, Max. Tommy'll never leave her alone. Jerry never wanted her mixed up in that part of his life. Yeah, I know. She goes with you... she's in deeper. I'll take care of her. I'll make sure she's okay. You've been taking care of people all your life, Rico. Your mother... your kid brother. Yeah, well somebody had to. Right? [Max] I know. And you did a pretty good job of it. But you keep on like this and you're going to end up just like your old man. [Rico] I'll never be like him. I would never walk out on my family. [Max] It's not what I'm saying. Just don't let the anger eat you up. [soft piano music] [pigeon coos] Max if something happens and I'm not back -in an hour or two-- -you always come back. Just like these guys. Yeah, but if I don't, there's a briefcase under your couch with a lot of money in it. Part of the job that got Jerry killed? Yeah. I want you to make sure Cleo gets that. Okay? [soft piano music continues] [Rico] Manny. I know I got people pissed. [Manny] Those plates are hot. Yeah, I know they're hot. [Manny] Guys will kill me because those plates are hot. [Rico] Why do you think I'm giving you such a screaming deal, huh? [Manny] Those plates are worth a little money Rico. So come on, do you want them or not? [Manny] Okay, you know where to meet me. Okay, I'll see you soon. [spinning noise] [blues guitar music] [knocking] -Manny. -Hey Rico! Nice to see you again. Come in. So, here we are. What's under your collar, Manny? [Manny] What do you mean? You look pale. Oh, I had some bad shellfish for lunch. It's been killing me. I bet. So, are those the plates? Yep. Mind if I use the john first? No, no. Not at all. You can leave the briefcase... if you like. [spinning noise] Show time, Bullet. -Let's do it. -Sure. The money? [Rico] Well, open it. Come on, open it. [briefcase clicks] Tell me something. Why are there two cars with New York plates parked in front of two dark rooms? Hmm? They can't both be sleeping and the hookers ain't out yet. [chuckles nervously] [punching] [Manny yells] [crashing noise] [gunshots] [trigger clicks] [shatters] Keep your hands where I can see them! [Rico] Do it, Manny! Don't, don't kill me. Please! I ought to blow your brains out. It'd be my right. [Manny] The plates. You're not taking them? So I can walk into another setup? No thanks. I came for money. That's all I'm taking. [Tommy] Here come the judge! Joey, Joey. You have no idea how glad I am to see you. [Tommy] Hey coach. It's been a long time, huh? You two! On the floor, now. Move! Put your hands behind your back. [Tommy] Don't you move a hair. Now, I suppose you would be Jerry Trask's kid, uh? Yeah, and I suppose you're the prick that killed him. Who, me? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Rico told you I killed him, didn't he, huh? [chuckles] [Tommy] Now that's rich. You and me are gonna have to have a little talk... later. Now, listen. I'm not gonna sit here and blow smoke up your ass, people. Rico has got certain items that I want. And I'm not going to rest until I get them. Now the question is... who's gonna help me find them? You, Joey? Go fuck yourself, Tommy. [Tommy] You know, I don't think you people-- [punching noise] realize just how serious I am! Listen, Tommy. Don't do anything stupid in front of so many people. You know, that's the wonderful thing about witnesses. [gunshots] [man groans] you can be... erased. [snaps finger] Like that. Now, who's gonna talk to me, eh? Who? [knife clicks] Oh, Angelo, look what we have here. [Tommy] The Mexican cavalry to the rescue. Hey, Taco! Is that the way they do things down south, south of the border? They hear gunshots and they come running with a knife. That's terrific. Very bright. What's the matter? Oh I see. [gunshot] [thump] Screw him. Probably didn't even have a Green Card. You're lucky I didn't call immigration on you! [Max] You were always a low life punk. Now you're just a murdering scumbag. You know at first, your attitude was amusing. But now, you're starting to piss me off. [gunshot] [thump] [Cleo cries out] Max! [yells] I'm gonna get you! [glass shatters] [punching] I told Rico you were a gimp! -[Joey groans] -You and your brother, huh? You went way over the line this time, didn't you? You think you can fuck with me and get away with it? -Nobody fucks with me. Nobody! -[Joey groans] -What is this? -[Joey whimpering] It looks like we caught one somewhere down the line, huh? Alright, where's Rico? Where's the plates? Where's the money? Answer me! I'll make that wound look like a paper cut! You better answer me! I ain't gonna tell you dick! You came at me with a bottle... [glass shatters] now it's my turn. [jabbing noise] [Joey groans] [Joey whimpers] Ballsy little bastard, you! Angelo. Search this place from top to bottom. Start upstairs! [Tommy] The odds are ten to 1, you're gonna find the pay money. -[Tommy] Go ahead. -[Angelo] Yeah, sure. [Tommy] Now, Miss. I think it's time you and I had that little talk about your father and Rico. [truck engine] [Angelo] Hold it, Rico! Don't try anything funny! I swear to God I'll kill you! [trigger clicks] You really think you got it in you, Angelo? [Angelo] Try something funny and you'll find out. Now, move! I admit, Tommy ain't the nicest guy in the world. But doing what you did? That's just suicidal man. [Rico] I'll never understand why you keep backing him up, Angelo. You know, you're the last guy in the world who should be -looking out for Tommy C. -What are you talking about? Come on! Wise up! All those dopey runs to the track he sends you on? What do you think he's doing when you're gone Angelo, huh? [Angelo] Well I don't know, but I'm sure you're gonna -tell me, right? -[Rico] Hey, I hate to be the one to gossip, but more than one person has seen Tommy's car parked in front of your house. -Hey, screw you Rico! -No, screw your wife! -That's what Tommy's doing. -Shut up! Just imagine his greasy little paws all over her body. Doesn't that drive you nuts, Angelo? I swear, Rico, I'll fucking shoot you. Now, shut up! No, you won't because Tommy wants me alive. Right, Angelo? Don't be so sure about that. [Rico] Just imagine Tommy hammering her. She's riding him. Oh what a-- [loud punch] Fuck you! Fuck you! [loud punch] [Angelo groans] [stabbing noise] [Angelo grunts] [loud thud] [eerie music] [door crashes] [trigger clicks] [Tommy] Rico! Come in and join us! I guess Angelo didn't make it. Where's Joey? [Tommy] Joey, huh? The last time I saw Joey he was... he was at the end of the bar fighting with a bottle. [gunshots] [glass shattering] [Rico sobbing] Oh, Joey. Oh Joey. Look at you. Joey... This my fault. This is all my fault! Max. Max! Please... help me! -[trigger clicks] -Fuck you, Rico! [Tommy cries out] [suspenseful music] [grunts and gasps] [Rico] Cleo, come on. We're out of here. [Cleo] You killed my father. -Cleo. -[Cleo] Don't deny it! And don't lie! [Rico] I didn't know who he was. I didn't know you. You killed him and you weren't even going to tell me. How? How could I tell you something like that? [Rico] I'm sorry, baby. If I could take the bullet myself, I would. [gunshot] [Rico groans] [coughs and groans] Cleo, I never meant to hurt you.
