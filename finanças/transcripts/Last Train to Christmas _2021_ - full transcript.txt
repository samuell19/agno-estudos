A Christmas gift to bring you cheer. I only want you. I'll fill your stocking to the brim. I only want you with lots of shiny things with it. That would be nice to a new car. Let's go take a spin. Sounds great. I'd love to accept. How about a brand new sweater? I haven't won the one from last year. A mug for tea and chocolate. A ring might be nice. I wouldn't sing twice. A new perfume or sweet clock. I only want you a trip to see Paris. Could possibly do. Although, you know, a five carat stone is not a bad idea. Well, neither is a boat. Well, as always next year. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome on board. 15. Five from Santa. Nottings. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you on board and wish you all a very Merry Christmas. Come on. We can have some bubbly they do for Tony Tows. Can you give us a hand with those of them? Hey, do you like clubbing? What? Any weeknight. Bring this card. Tell him Tony Tower sent you right now. Everyone who wants to join us for Shampers. You're all welcome. How many guests? 34567. We're going to have champagne. Don't worry. We'll keep it down. Any minute before looting. I feel nervous. You got to be nervous about after what Roger did to me. He's the one who should be nervous. Listen, you worry a pretty little man about. Okay? You and me have a little look around Tiffany as we get back. Okay, Ratners, I don't need any more presents. Sometimes it feels like you show me off. What's wrong with that? You're beautiful. And you're going to be the new Mrs. Tell me to Alice. People are interested in what I do. Are we going to have a family. We'Re going to want? Not right now. Jesus Christ. At least I thought we were right now is probably not the perfect one. I want to have ten kids we have in the family or playing father's side. And I want to live in Norfolk. That's a commute. And I want us to wear chunky jumpers and drinks. Now that we can do. Oh, super sorry. Tickets. I'm just looking to the buffet. Good for you. Where's your ticket? Really? My fiance. My 17 air retirement. Not in June. Congratulations. Look good for you. And Where's your ticket? Oh, yeah? Tell me why you. What she'll tell you why I recognize you. See, is your carpet Fiat? No. You sell Shammy Thunderwell Market? No, I'm Tony Towers. The Astoria in Nottingham. The what? What's that phrase? You're only famous if someone knows who you are. Well, we don't know who you are. It's the biggest club in the Midlands. Where is it again? Listen, you like music, Morris? What music do you like? I like metal. You play metal at this club? Not so much. She's waiting for me. I just got to get my fiance. I've never met my brother or his wife. She's nervous. I just need two minutes to get to the buffering. Come on, Maurice, you're a reasonable man. You've got tinsel on your head. The full hourlock fare is £18.90. Really? You're really going to do this? Merry Christmas, Sue. Have you seen my tickets? They were in my wallet. Is that them? Is that Roger? No, he's Ginger. I can't find him. Yeah, well, that's Roger for you. I can't get to the buffet without the tickets. You're shaking. It's fine. Where are they? In your wallet? No, I've looked there. Are they in your bag? You won't believe this suit. There's a girl in the next carriage. Never heard of it. This is crazy. I need them to get the bubbly. Forget about your silly champagne. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Everything all right? What do you mean, Rogers? Somewhere behind this. Sorry. I wonder who bought you this. Lovely to me. Next to my present from Antibiotics. Here we go. Oh, no, hang on a minute. I can't do that because I've already packed it right at the bottom of my suitcase. You know about it? No. Tone seems to think that our antibiotic always bought me better presents doesn't benefit. He seems to think one year he gets a guitar. I get a pineapple to get back. Then you two going to sit down a pineapple 30 years ago and he's still going on about it. I'm sorry, Paula. I was going to be sitting there Tone Day. I don't like going to just sit down. Wow. Like her already. Lovely jewelry. Oh, thank you. Been splashing out, Joe. Well, things are certainly busy. Got six new clubs opening six. He's got six new clubs. Got to be ambitious, Roger. I've always told you that. Six, though. We're upgrading Nottingham, 10,000 sqft. Five minutes from Market Square. What about Gary de Corsi's place gone fire. Kidding or not? Why is that so funny? Nightclubs never burned. It's always an insurance. Well, even with Garagon, I still think it's a bit March. Well, if you beg me, I might just let you come back. Oh, no, that's really not going to happen. I'm very happy he's going to try and convince you now that he's still in show business. I'm in the music business. What do you do there's? Headphones that broke ten minutes after you're born. I work for say show. Ask him what part of Japan that's from. It's Dixon's own bright, Steven age, well known suburb of Tokyo. Listen, Tony, when he stops selling 5 million personal stereos a year, he'll give you a call. All right. Oh, cheers, sue. It's funny. I really like her. I'm getting that bubbly. What? Let's celebrate our engagement. Tickets. It's dropped for cash too. Fine. Thank you, Paula. It's okay. I'm good. Paula, will you just what? You were in a bit of trouble. Tell no why you asked him to come back. I didn't ask him to come back. Six clubs is a bit crazy. I said if he begged me how much you borrow it, it was going to be eight clubs. I know this is hard for you to accept, Roger, but I'm doing perfectly well without you. I'm just don't need your concern. I've managed to keep that club going perfectly well, despite the fact that you left me in the shit. Okay. Champagne. It is exciting already. All right, listen, you too, have a good night. He was right, Roger. They all failed. Tell you what, everyone just back up here. Let's just give him some space. You're going to be all right. All right. Think these three mate. Come over. Sit down. This one's. What a joke. Is it? Having a good laugh away turned Tony Tars into a failure. Hilarious. You know what. Tony did it. Enjoy. Merry Christmas. I'm an enemy word. I have a box. Listen, Tony, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. It came out all wrong. Come back. What? You're right. Six clubs is stupid. I walked out. You're what I need. You're my Phil Specter. You're my Tony disconte. That's very nice. It'll be different this time. Tell me what I did wrong. You really want to know? Yes. You never gave me credit for one. You call it Tony Tower story. Even though we agreed to call it The Mighty Towers. And you said we were going to go 50 50. I'll make it 60 40. It's a different business now. Phone parties, wet T shirts. It's not me. The clubs don't work. That's it. Look, let's not get ourselves. This was always your thing. It's serious, Rodge. When you're there, it works. Just look at the business plan. Sure, but I can tell you right now. I'm going to say just open one new club. Where are you going? I'll be back in the set. Lovely to see. Your mom said you might be home for Christmas. How are you holding up? Fine. I was so sorry to hear your news. You are. You must be devastated. Sure. Which parts do you know? Your mom told me everything she did? Yes. What did she say? She said you were doing as well as could be expected. It's been difficult. Yes. Have you spoken to two? Anyone? Baku? Someone who could listen? Not really. You should. I will. I passed it last week. You did in a taxi. How is it? It's horrible. All that work you put into it. Yes. And what would the recession and that right. And now just gone. Gone. Did they ever find the cause electric? I do hope someone didn't start it on purpose. Such a waste. I mean, what are the chances of both clubs going up like that, slim? Yeah. Your things going. You don't deserve it, aren't you? There on top of everything else. Everything else. That was very unfair. She seems so nice for that girl. I think she had a plan all along. Really? I think some people see an opportunity and take it. You probably don't want to hear this, Anthony, but I've always thought you were a little too trusting of people. People take what they want and then they disappear. Just like that. You need to think of yourself, Tony, about what you want because nobody else is going to. I always said that to your brother. Now, I'm telling you. Is Roger on the train? I doubt it. Why he doesn't take the train anymore? No, he doesn't have the time. Of course he travels by helicopter. Helicopter mostly. Of course he does. So they keep him very busy. Oh, I'm sure they do. Yeah. Let me take a wild guess. That one's for him. What do you mean. Just a stupid joke me and Roger used to make. I was always convinced you got him better presents than me. Sure. There's nothing in there. I don't know if you remember, but you got me a pineapple. That was never very good at all. That wasn't your mother. It was only your present just wasn't me. It's fine. I love pineapple. Look, I have a tissue. I'm sorry. Two scared, anti VI. Scared of one. The limited range song songs had to be simple. Tony, you never told me you could have been together. That was a very long time ago. Sad, fairly recording. You had a single. Well, sort of. It was this booth. They had one at Waterloo Station. You had 65 seconds to record anything you like. I suppose you could say this is a limited edition. We thought we were a skiff or band. I have no idea what that is. But we weren't brilliant. We had enthusiasm and that's about it. Speak for yourself and only four songs. Four good songs. Those are the ones you try to sing. We tried to sing. You're not into his music. I like some of it. That's a ringing. I like music for my own. I like chat music. This is what I'm dealing with. It's not what I call music. Why don't you like me? What do you mean? One of the things that you like about it. Everything. I'm serious. What is it? I'm successful. You're fishing for compliments? No. If things were different, if things changed, if I changed, if I lost all this, I'd say I had nothing. Are you trying to make out like I'm shallow? Not really. Like all I care about is jewelry. And I just want to know what you want to tell the truth. How can you say that? We get married? Do you know what that means? I've done it before. Did you ask Linda these questions? No. Because Linda and I should never got married. We did it because we had two since I ruined the life. She turned my son against me. I haven't seen him for five years. You haven't seen him for five years? No. He's angry. I don't know what Linda's told him. She's lying to him. Well, she's probably embellishing it a bit embellishing. What? You know what I'm like? What the hell? I worked in nightclub. So things were exciting. You still working nightclub? I'm just telling you how it was. I'm being honest. You think I want that to happen again? Well, I don't know, Tony. You tell me you've got six new clubs opening. How exciting is that going to be? They're all going to fail soon. All of them. You're going to end up married to a loser who's old and broke. So let me ask you again. Why do you like me? I don't want any of it. Sell it. I don't care. And I'm here for you. Whatever. Whether it's a success or not, you have to promise me one thing. All the excitement you need is right here. Get a room. Try harder. There's. Got me away. I don't like going backwards. You are, dad. It's your God game. It takes you longer than the real war. Where have you been? To take a League, Linda. Dad, are you playing? Roger? Can I have what in the middle of the game? You can't see that he's upset. Just roll or die. Tell me that's my piece. Do you not touch that? Girls? Do you want to take over Roger? Have you got snow? Move, dad, don't ruin it. We don't want to play. Dad. You're going to make him cry. Can you please just move? Okay. Dad, you're doing it right, Tony, what is the matter with you? Put him in solitary confinement. He's only ten. You could have come after me. We're just a winner. Everything. Hey, I was just following orders. We can play a game. So I don't know why it's acting like this. Come on. Look, let's just put everything back where it was. Tony. You can't just put it back and fix it. Tony, it's done. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. Honestly, I made a mistake. What do you want? Do you want some sweets? Some chocolate? Yeah. Fruit, no marathon, a whisper bar. What the hell is a whisper bar? Okay, what do you like? He likes to add tech bars, Tony, then you wouldn't know about that. Would you. Pick up the rest of the German security guards off the floor till we could use a few of these in the club weekends? A lot of money in there. Well, let's do it. Really? Just do it. This is not like you want you to take more control, Rod. What's brought this up? Nothing club's doing. Well, let's down to Roger as much as me. We're going to be the new tramps before you know it. So it's time we clarified a few things. I want people to know Roger's name as much as mine. Eight girls. You want that to be famous, don't you, Tony? What are you doing? It's the Mighty Towers, Ruth. Serious. 50 50. I mean, we can shake on it now in front of everyone. Right? Let's get that adsec while then shall we? Does you do, Cobbs? You are kidding me. You did do cops. Didn't you do them on Southwest? What about Scott Cheese? I'll tell you whatever you've got. Mates. Yeah. No, stop. See? Always some change for phone. I'm dying to try. Please tell me first one. I was originally signed for The Apt, but we all know what happened to that, don't we? Even if we had the album's Passenger Train. It wouldn't made any difference to me. As if it was ever going to come to Nottingham. Nottingham. You're from Nottingham? What? Nightclubs are in Nottingham? Big nightclubs, of course. His place? No. The Astoria. Roger Tarz. You mean Roger Tar is Astoria? That's them. I've never been myself. It's a massive place, apparently. Actually, it's an old location. What about Tony? Tony Tarz. His brother. He's got a brother just off the minute. Hello? The rest of this in ten peas. Hello? Really? Want to ring my wife? I just want to try the new phone. What? I was done. You just have to keep pumping them in. You ready? Go on down there. Sure. You're ready? Ready? 855. Go. Hello. Can you hear me? Hello? Is that Mrs Taylor? 1 second. Keep putting them in. This is Taylor. It's Tony. Tony Tarz. It's sue. There sue. Sue Taylor, my fiance. Come on. I've lost that's ever made. I'll just have these ULA roots. You can't eat that, Tony. It's got rum in it. That's true. I wanted an Aztec bar. He asks you for one thing. I'll have it. If no one wants it, anyone get your own. Tony, I'm sorry. I didn't know you wanted it. Tony, stop here. This is mine too. Tony, I'm so sorry. You've had a big day. I'm not tired. I don't need any help from you. I thought we were going to be part. You're nothing. You're nothing. Nothing without me. You're a parasite. You just suck out all my good ideas. Mars. Please look at what you're doing. But you will. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Come on, girl. I think we should sit somewhere else. No, Paula. Tony should go. Oh, yeah. That's what you'd like. You are. You're never going to give me another chance, are you? No, not when you're acting like this. No. Right. Doesn't matter what I say. You've already made your mind up about me. Whose fault is that? You complicated this, Tony. You did everything to ruin it. You think I wanted this? I never wanted any of this, Tony. But the fact is, this is how it is. And there is nothing we can do to change that. You want it back. There you are. You deserve happier. Life leader. Lily, what are you doing? Might have known you too. Take that with you. But let's go of it. You can't play in the toilet. That's the only place for it. Do think for a second, but Granddad will play it. Let's put it away, son. Heaven forbid. They found out spent your first wage packet on a record you can't even play. That was a solid apprenticeship. Anthony. You're not going to get anything like that again. £2 a week before tax. He wants to be a singer. He can be a lot just because you got many talents. But you know, Mario loser music's not a job. You need a trade. And then why has he got a guitar? Why is Roger got a guitar from Antivirus? It's not much of a mistress. He's only ten. He's ruined it more. You're upsetting him. Answer me. Fine. I'll leave it then. Whatever that could be. I know for a fact that present was very hard to come by. Yeah. Brought it to tears. What's that talking about? She cried when I asked her about it. Said she was scared or something. She did what? When did you see on Dubai. What did you ask her? Why she gave Roger a better present? You never asked her that. When was this? Why did she cry? What? What is it? You just be quiet, mind. There's something funny. I'll catch you in a minute. There are things that we'll talk about when you're a bit more grown up. When? When you're older. about Antivirus. Perhaps. But we'll talk about it. Then why? She buys me an hour's presence. Well, that's part of it. As I say, you'll just have to wait. You'll have to. We're not talking about this anymore. We're not talking about this now. In the final. I think it's time. Anthony, wait in the corridor. A night, please. On the street. I got the design out on the street moving your feet got the desire so don't put out the fire cry when you look at the sky maybe we found a break in the cloud. See? Go, wait. No, we did. Beautiful. Amazing. Well, I wrote the words, actually. Why don't you come and join us? Absolutely not. This is Henry Davis. Hang on a minute. Bingo. Here we go, girls. Roger, you can't do that. I do love you. Well, like with Madame. Care for an appear a tea. Tony, are you done yet? I could do with a hand. Sorry, Valerie. Do you want to join us? No, thank you, Roger. We got a bit carried away. I can see that, Tony, I'm on my own here. I need the new one. Jenny's lost perky. So you enjoy music? Maybe it's a very good question, Jenny. I think we'd all like to know what you all like. Are you going to run her toy or what? I'll be back. Oh, what a dreadful shame. How am I possibly going entertaining these two on my own? I'll show your manage. Darling. This guy. This interview is no good for you. You go now. You changed the strength. They started. No interview for you. You don't like the single. It's not about what I like. You think it's shit. I like parts of it why you compare us to the bloody Bombas or Vombus? Remember you're? I can check it. I don't write the whole paper. I'm not a Womble mate. I know you want to be taken seriously, but you've only had novelty success so far. We saw twice as many as the one. If you want credibility, you're going to have to talk to the music press. You twist it. I will not twist it. I just want some answers to make some sort of sense. I can't use a word of this. So far. Tony is a genius. Fine. Then show me. We'll give you 20 minutes. Good. So why don't you start by helping me decipher some of these song errors? Let's start with the hit Eagles of Love, right? Well, originally it was called Rock Astrid. He's fine. Don't talk to her like that. He sits next door. Tony's doing this interview. He's got enough pretty already. What does that mean? Like you don't know. You feel Tony doesn't speak for the band. This thing running. Come on. Why are you getting nervous? Are we? Tony worried you secret back slap on the wrist. Go and sit on the naughty. Do this later. Oh, that's what you'd like, isn't it? Roger May. Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about, Roger. I'm not doing anything. Yeah, that's exactly the problem right there. I don't understand, too. Right. So you're saying Tony's not involved much in terms of creativity. This track couldn't play the Wobble bar. You stopped this interview. No, I want to hear it. Whatever's wrong, Roger, we can sort it out. Not with a tint recorder. You're my Shink. Now you're upset. I can see that. What is it? You really want to open that can of worms, too? Because you know what's inside another can't. I just want to make this work Rudge. That's all I want. Okay, fine. Let's do it. Let's get into it first. Stress champagne for the on Tia. Nervous, he gets at the side of one. Ask him why he lives in Guernsey. I live in Guernsey 90%. I pay. I'd be surprised if he pays to Bob find another day. We do this after Christmas. No, Astrid, we do this now. Just rude. Rodge, come on. You're not like this. This isn't you. You don't know the first thing about what I'm like. I have a question, Chief. Well, there's been some uncertainty. Rumors, actually, about the band. Regarding your performances, you've had many TV appearances. Top of the Pops, crack, Cracker Jack. But there wasn't any mention of the band ever sinking live. Do. Why do you think that is tone? Tony's voice is very delicate. That's right. That's right. Tony's voice is so delicate. Write it down. It's so unique to have Tony style, Tony's charisma and Tony singing voice all in one amazing package. I mean, imagine if I could sing, for example, that just wouldn't work. Would it want to listen to a boring twirl like me? Okay, that's an awful lot. But Tony has it all. Go on. Sony, give us a little tune. I'm sure we'd all like to wear it. All right, Astrid, he won't use the taste. Of course I'm going to use the taste. Of course, me won't. How do you know Where's he going? He's saying what I think he's saying. Definitely not. What do you think he's saying? I suppose he's suggestingit's not. Actually. You the singing Tony, are you with us? Something wrong? We'll just start from the top. From what you say. Well, I've had an absolutely delightful trip. Well, I've had an absolutely delightful trip. Lovely. Carry on. And thanks to the advanced passenger train's unique design you are. We've been traveling as an average speed of 100 mph, then to the breakfast table and sit. But my coffee cup hasn't spilled a drop and he goes to take a drink. But don't take a drink. What? Yeah, and that's the basic shape of it. Just. I'm just wondering if things short or a bit short. Tony, we've got to make a little change. Bernard, whose idea was to sit? Belle Rembo. You come with me, my dear. I think I found a perfect spot for you. I suppose you have this problem with radio anyway, I think you're going to be very pleased with the replacement. I'm so excited. I was only inclined to watch. I promise you it is. Okay, look, I'm shaking up a hand. Please, don't worry. You'll be fine. So what we're doing after this? What do you mean? Well, everyone's talking about going to your club. Sure. So that's me going home, then why? Well, you're not going to let me in, aren't you? Who's a will really short. I think they look great. They're better than the shorts you had in the other ad. Listen, Tony, we need to make an INSY, windy change to the script. That bit about the apt traveling faster than twice the legal limit of a car and motorway. Well, Sandy pointed out might not be appropriate given recent events, recent events. And with the date set for the court case, it's probably best to avoid any potential overlap. What do you mean? Well, obviously, we all wish your brother the very we can't in any way associate this campaign with what happened. I'm sure you'll understand. We'll just snip that bit out, shall we? Okay. What happened next? Sorry. Are you okay? You're taking it all very well. I don't know what's going on. None of us do. I love you. What? I love you, dad. Is there something wrong. I heard it was difficult. We do. Twinkle. What you do realize this is bullshit? I better be paying you a shit load because you look like a knobbit. Sorry. Say a boy strip. You're a serious mate, not Danny La bloody roof. What we need to do is get back out there, get some of the old material released. We recorded some gems back then. There's this guy now, and his name is mainly those plumbing in the moment, but he's proper loaded. I told him about the music we did together and he said you might want to release some of it anyway. Point is, Alan's not going to take off seriously if you're drinking off in crap five bits. What's that on your leg? That's a pain in the ass. That's what that is. I have to make these things so ugly. Party made an amazing cover. That said an odd active follow. But the probation officer said it interfered with the signal. Mums, install the base station over Christmas. Just another thing. That's freaking her out. I mean, she's an old woman, Tone. She doesn't need all this. Is she okay? Of course not. And all this bullets, they've been saying it's the last thing she needs to rehab. So what? Boring? Everyone goes to Reab these days. So I fact, it often did it myself. So did move on. What's next? Anyway, you heard about the festival. We're doing a festival this summer. Or maybe next summer. Anyway, we got a line up. You wouldn't believe. So. How old was Hendrix when he died? 27. Exactly. Joplin Bran Jones, Jim Morrison. Bodioli. I don't think Bodioli was get colvain. Who we get bands. Good bands. Bands. We like to pretend they're 27 again and do a set exactly as they would have done. Rick Weightman in a gold Cape. Gabriel sunflower. Exactly. I'd pay to see that, wouldn't you? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You move in these circles. I do. You're the one in here. They're all at these deals. So you want me to ask Peter Gabriel to dress up as a sunflower? Listen, if he hadn't done it before, it'd be weird. I grant you. He's probably still in his wardrobe. Do I go to these sorts of parties? Of course you do. Look, that's me with Christopher Biggins. Roger. He's hardly Dylan Biggins might even know Dillon. Who knows? Point is, we get to these people. They have the idea they'll love it. Well, what? You're not suggesting? What? Well, you're not saying that they should have died when they were 27. Okay? Don't help me. Then do it. Then don't help me sit there top of the world just to get the ball rolling about a few rough years. Sorry. Rely on your family. Okay? Truth is, Tone not doing this for me. I'm doing it for our mom. Well, your mom don't say that. Well, it's true indeed. Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do whatever you need. See? Here you go. You'll just wait till this is just the beginning. Tell you what. We'll come see this parlor twangcaster Christmas deal. You can get a drink if you like. Don't blow the rose. Yeah, I might do that. Actually. Knock yourself out. Of course. Are you okay? I think you'd remember to check the car insurance. Yes, probably a good idea. Take it easy. See, AME that's the actual hat or the actual real hat? We watched every episode. You would have won it. Yeah, definitely. Would they let you go back? Of course they won't let him go back. But what about all that work you've done? It's taken 20 years off. Yeah, honestly, but no one will see it. You know, you surprised me, dad. I did. Yeah, it was quite a sacrifice. And the hell of a long way to come. We wouldn't have minded if you stayed in Australia. Must that be thickness? Really luck. Who? Yeah, you didn't notice. We love to laugh, mom. Of course you are, Darling. This is a time for happy memories, too. You put them on your page, David's doing a MySpace page. What do you think? It's not Loading properly. Isn'T it? I wonder why she would have thought of it. She or you can ask her yourself. Gamma. What do you think of David's web page as well? It's a special page on the Internet for Roger. Wow. No good twin now. No, it's about Roger. You can type a message. Why would I want to do that? He's worked so hard on it. We worked as hard as we could for Roger. Did everything we could have done more. No, I mean, the page on the World Wide Web. Maybe we did the wrong thing with Arthur. I always have to live with that. You have a little rest. You. Need anything. We should have kept it to ourselves. But Arthur said no. Thank you, Lov. I don't see why she blames herself. Her mindset. She still thinks what? You didn't drink. Come on. Told her it was all life. Yeah, then sweets. Vodka from a water bottle right in front of her. Bald as brass. No, it was part of that thing with me. You know, I was sure she was good news. She was as bad as in. You know, she turned up my work once. Some sub story about Roger beating her up. Complete nonsense. Yeah. I gave a 60 quid, didn't I? Turns out Rogers waiting down the stairs to go straight to the office. You were way too kind as she was, though. And those two split. Those was a steak. He never really got over it. He got it in his head that she was in postsmith or something. That's what he was talking to. Yeah, right down the middle of the M 27. It was just horrible. I should have done something. No one could have stopped him. He only listens to me. We were the mighty towers anymore. 24 hours a day. I'm not cease. That's not me. I was too scared, Auntie. Come on. Listen. This fella from Gladiators emo snail people. That show is massive. You get me ten minutes with Wolf. Just let me talk to him. Let me explain the concept. And you know. Hey, what the hell are you doing? If you want water, I'll get you water. Let's see. Next stop. Next stop. Okay, you got me. What do you want? A medal. I just want you to tell me something. That's not a steaming pile of horseshit, Roger. 18 minutes. More like so. Like a drink. So does Patty. So do you. We all like a sip on a warm day social drink as that for them. Because I don't want to drink the Pisties place. Please, Roger, just stop it. Stop it. This is me. This is. Tell me. Give a shit. Of course I do. I'm your brother, is it? It is to me. Come on, Patty. Let's go. Where's it going? What about mom and dad? It's Christmas tomorrow for you. Maybe it was never really Christmas for me. Roger, come on. Come on, please. I know where this goes. This doesn't end well. Please just let me help you, all right? That's what you want in it. Make it all about you. Just like always. You never gave a shit about how all this makes you. Look, I can see you doing it now. Tony says Roger. Tony Diera. Well, guess what. Tony happy. Please talk to him. Fuck you, Tony. Roger. Roger. Roger. Tony, listen, we're rather up against it, old chat. We really need to get a move on. The train will be knotting him in half an hour, Jenny. Okay. Two minutes. I need you to listen to me very carefully. I'm going to ask you some questions I want you to answer like I don't know anything. Please just pretend. Understand? Okay. Where is Roger? He's on remand. Why? You already know. What did it just say? Come on. Is that it? Is anyone hurt? No, that's not much of a crime then. Well, it wasn't his car. It was his accountants. Okay, we just hit with the bread bin. Right? And why did he do that? Well, he thinks he condemned him out of 80 grand. But then you told me he spent all his tax on a pig far. But it's not like after the pigs properly. And then one eight is jacket. That Silva, one that Mcgrnson lent him. And so he pushed the pig off a cliff. And now the RSPC won him as well. Jesus Christ. Which is why you set up that account for me. I always put a third aside and I never touched it. Very good. Well, really got to get a move on. I'm terribly sorry. Now we've had a little conflab and we've come up with this. I mean, it's much, much better. The apt is so smooth. The only rocking and rolling I'll be doing is with these. Then you hold these up. Shall we do an availability check on Bobby Dovero, please? There are children on this train. Roger, put your trousers on me, Mr. Towers. Looks like you got an actual story for one. This is all I could find. I pulled the passport. Police. Maybe I should go. No, give it. I've got an idea. Can you open this? It stinks in there. Just recess. You ready? Exactly. Prestige qvey I know that as long as it's wet, you still mad at me. All right, look, Roger, the band is clearly a mess. Whatever the record company suggested, we obviously shouldn't have listened to me. Okay? I shouldn't have listened. Whatever I agreed to, it was stupid. You want to try again? Do it our way this time. You know what Jim Morrison was when he died? He's 27. I know that. Andrix so there's less competition. Who cares how old we are? Eight. Leonard Cohen. Yeah, he was ancient before anyone started giving a toss. It's about what you do right now, Roger. The decisions you make today. That's what matters. You serious? Of course I am. You Fonte. You're the singer. I'll be on Moraccas or whatever. You got to promise me one thing. You come and live in Guernsey. You what? You're giving away 90 Pence of every pound. You choose not to give me financial advice. But we are going do this right there's is going on. Just hang on. Can I go? Everybody? Just hold your horses for two minutes, Morris. Two weeks, I guess. Do you like Armus? Oh, really? No. You like metal, don't you? Heavy rock. I bet you like Sabbath, of course. Perfect. Do you have any idea how hard they had to work to ride those homes? I got the artistic agony Ozzy Osborne went through to make Sabbath bloody Sabbath. He ended up writing in the dungeon to get inspiration and off killed him. Some people don't make it make great. That's what that is, my friend. That's the struggle right there. You've handled this well. Brilliantly. Actually. Playing cards, right. You could be destined for big things from the back of it. But just remember, you don't get Children of the Grave without that. I love that song. Of course you do. Now you want to support new music? One another Sabbath album. How about you just let him slip off at the next station? You know what I'm saying? Don't need to get the police involved that way. You're doing it for the arms. You're doing it for music. You're doing it for us. Feels the confusion under Doom electric funeral rat salad. Okay, folks, everyone to move to the back. What the hell was that? It would didn't. Luftbrook is your next station. Your next station is Loughborough. Why aren't you in first class? You're Tony Towers. She'll be down here. Oh, can I ask you a question? Okay. Those girls on your show, holding the Teasmade or whatever. How do they get that job? Because it doesn't look that hard to me. I don't know. I'm sure I can find out. Really? You can really do that. That's amazing. I mean, Dulce is all right. The people are nice and everything, but I don't want to be there forever. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Si, by the way. So we haven't met before? Not actually met. You made a joke about me once in the audience, though. Although it could have been about lame. The lights are very bright. It's hard to tell. When was this? We came on a work day to watch the show. God, there's a lot of waiting around, isn't there? I mean, I'm not saying it's boring or anything. It's just not like on Towing. You must have shouted, Come on down about 200 times. So is that what I'm known for? Then you are. I'm not known for music. Music? What's? What music? Eagles of Love. What's that then? It's a song in the charts more recently. It's not on here. It was a hit, I think. When was this? 74. 75? Well, I should know it. I always watched off of the Pops after school. Jesus. How did it go? You want me to sing it for you right now? Yeah, go on, then. I mean, I didn't know Tony Towers could sing. All right. You can join in everybody all together now. You're having me on. I'm not. Well, I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but you're not much of a singer, are you? Well, you don't mean to be rude. Well, it was my brother, my cousin, who was the singer. I guess it worked out best for you then. Yeah, I guess they did. Although I'd rather be in a band. Everyone wants to be in a band. Yeah, but we had something. My husband had something. So is he then? I don't know. A bit tropical old. I don't recognize him anymore. He used to sell those. He had a wife, two lovely kids, twins. They don't exist anymore. I'm sorry. That's terrible. Although I suppose his wife would, but not in the same way. Very confusing. Well, families are complicated. Don't even get me started on mine. I bloody dread this trip. Every year. We get to about 11:00 on Christmas Day, and it all kicks off. Just stay quiet now. Don't say anything. My new rule is let people live their own lives. It's not my responsibility. Does that sound cool? I suppose not. I mean, I'm there for them. Of course. If they want my help, I'm there like that his family. But they've got to ask. I'm only there if they ask. Meanwhile, I get all of my life. How's this? Good enough for an audition. That's very good. I'm going to write my number down. I'm still at my mom so I can get my own place. But if I'm not in, she'll take a message. I'm not going to take this, sue you what? Meet someone nice and move to Norfolk. What do you mean? I have ten kids. Chunky jumpers, drink soup. Give me five minutes. Hey, what's going on? Sorry, Mr. Cows. But you want to get off? You won't get this from David. I think. Roger. Roger. There's no point. You tried to help him, but you can't scramble an egg. You've done everything you can do. You can't look after him forever. You've got some of your own life. Why tell Lou all your secrets? Who kissed them long ago? Whispering grass the trees don't need don't you tell her to the she will tell the birds and bees and everyone will know because you told the blabring trees yes, you told them anymore. Why tell them all the old things they buried under the snow whispering grass don't tell the trees because the trees don't need to know. Don'T you tell it to the breeze? Because she will tell the birds and bees and everyone will know because you told the blathering trees oh, yes, you told them once before and it is no secret anymore. I will not have gossip in this jungle. They'Re buried under the snow whispering grass don't tell the trees because the trees don't need. They said we'd need another 60 points. Stay. It's a dark hole of Liberty. If you ask me, why did you. Didn't they check the ground before the match? And you're not one to kick off a stinky joke? Nothing funny about stopping a test match. You only have one bottle for sure. You wait so far. Just stay for Christmas trip back. Closing up the dining car now, chaps. Thank you. So I said I failed to see what's so frightfully funny. But he just gives me the brush off and says, Hop it before this thing blows. I mean, really? Are you really trying to tell me there's an unexploded bomb? I'm of the Greece. Perhaps I should take him now. Get ready. He's just coming round. Need to have a look at that leg. There's room to lying down in the front carriage. This is your final stop. Nottingham station where this service will terminate. Moving your feet got the desire don't put out the fire why do you cry when you look at the sky? Maybe we found a break in the clouds? Eagles of love. Fly in a bus? Eagles of love Eagles of love fly in a bar? Eagles of love flying number.
