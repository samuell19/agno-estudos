APPLAUSE Hello and welcome to The Blame Game, the show that has more laughs than the average Northern Irish school has toilet rolls. I'm Tim McGarry and our regular panellists are, of course, Colin Murphy, Jake O'Kane and Neil Delamere. And our special guest tonight is a Scottish comedian, writer and director. She's been wowing audiences on radio and TV and at stand-up gigs all over the world. Next year sees her first solo show in five years. It's called Riches To Rags and was inspired by the fee she's getting for being on The Blame Game. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the one and only Jojo Sutherland. APPLAUSE Yes, it's the start of a brand-new series. We've been off air for a few months. So what have we missed? Well, in July, England won the World Cup by coming fourth. And Brexit is going swimmingly. Yes, it has emerged that after Brexit there might actually be a time difference between Northern Ireland and the South. Yes, the South could be in a different time zone. They'll be in the 21st century... ..and we'll still be in the 1600s. Actually, the difference will, of course, only be an hour. Northern Ireland will be an hour behind. And if you want to know what it's like being an hour behind, try getting through security at Belfast International Airport. The Pope visited Ireland in August and spent a lot of time saying sorry for the past actions of the Catholic Church. To be honest, the last time we heard so many apologies was when the BBC met Cliff Richard. LAUGHS AND GROANS Now, on with the show. The audience asks the questions and our panel provide some very unreliable answers. What did you in the audience ask us tonight? Who's to blame for the BBC Northern Ireland studio not having an RHI boiler outside to keep the audience warm? Who's to blame for boring people standing beside us in the queue to get in tonight? Said Seamus Kennedy. Where's Seamus Kennedy? No, who's he sitting beside? What's our first question tonight? Our first question tonight is who do you blame for taking Halloween too seriously? Yes, in Newtownards a group of men dressed in Ku Klux Klan outfits took pictures of themselves outside an Islamic centre. It's being treated as a racist hate crime. Personally, I hope the racists are arrested and flown out of the country. Ryanair caters for racist passengers... But who can we blame for taking Halloween too seriously? This place is great craic. I haven't been north of the border in a couple of months, and in that time Gerry Adams has a cookbook launched, the Ku Klux Klan has a rally and you've burned down a Primark. Wow. So, you know that everybody in this show, we're against all sorts of intolerance and even perceived intolerance. I went on the Ashers bakery website yesterday and I refused their cookies. I'm not conflating the two issues. Some people defended the people wearing those KKK outfits in Newtownards, saying it's just Halloween. There are loads of outfits you could wear on Halloween that aren't offensive to other people. What did you wear in the 1980s when I was growing up? You didn't get a costume, your ma put you in a black polythene plastic bag, the same thing that wrapped silage in a field, and you had the time it took you to walk from your front door to your neighbour's front door to decide what you actually were. You were a chimney sweep, you were a cat, you were a witch's cat and as long as you got the monkey nuts, you were grand. So why are these people going, "They're just dressed up on Halloween?" It's still offensive and they stood outside an Islamic prayer centre. That's offensive to people. You don't need to dress up like that. We know what the KKK stands for. Is there anybody, you think, in some tiny little racist town in Mississippi going, "What are you going to dress up as, "Billy Bob, for the Halloween?" "I'm going to dress up as a member of the UDA! Yeah!" You think there's some guy...? "I've learned some songs on my banjo." Dinga-ding-ding-ding-ding, # Up to my neck in fenian blood. # "I'm in the UDA, I got the guns, all I need now is the drugs. "No, sirree surrender, that's right." "And you're going to dress up as a generic member of the UDA?" "No, I'm going to dress up as Michael Stone." "No! THE Michael Stone?" "That's right, Michael 'I Can't Paint For Shit' Stone." "OK, if you're Michael Stone, I'm Dee Stitt. "Dinga-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!" It's just nonsense. APPLAUSE They're not the most educated, are they? You see signs, there are other signs as well with people saying, "Pakis go back to India". Geography! What's even better, Britain First came over here because apparently this is Britain! I think you'll find it's not - if anything technically it's the United Kingdom, but it's not Britain, Britain is the big island, this is the bit that's stuck on the side of the big island, apparently. Britain First have turned up here, typical bloody foreigners, coming over here, telling us how to live. They got chucked out of Wetherspoons. I've seen people stabbed in Wetherspoons, haven't been chucked out. I've seen people thrown into Wetherspoons. They went into Wetherspoons and Wetherspoons refused to serve them but they didn't chuck them out, so the guys stood around for five minutes, pointy hats on - I presume they kept them on... Do you drink like that? ..and then one of them goes, "Here, boys, I'm roasting," and that was it. Stand further away from the cross. APPLAUSE By the way, stop having a go at Michael Stone. Michael Stone was released during the summer. Oh, you didn't know that! You could have told me halfway through the joke, couldn't you? A good story came out of Derry over Halloween. Derry do Halloween... But the police and army raided the dissidents before Halloween and they took away 300 fireworks and 100 firework fuses. I think that's positive, because there would have been a time they'd have got rocket launchers and Armalites. Now they're getting fireworks. What's the dissidents like? "Right, lads, everybody together, light your sparklers!" That's improvement. That's good. Just watching... Ooh, aah! Ooh, ahh... Thank you, thank you very much for that. This week a video showed Celtic and Rangers fans clashing at Belfast City Airport. And just for Karen Bradley's benefit, Glasgow Rangers is a football team that is mainly supported by Catholics in Northern Ireland. Catholics love the Gers. So next time you meet Sinn Fein, break the ice by wearing a Rangers top and saying, "Steven Gerrard's doing a great job, isn't he?" They'll love it, Karen, I promise you. Sadly, however, there is still too much prejudice in Northern Ireland and here on The Blame Game we are against prejudice of any form. The last thing anybody wants to see is the spectre of sectarianism raising its ugly Protestant head. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Karen Bradley's sitting at home going, "Why is that funny?" So what is our next question tonight? Our next question tonight is who do you blame for asking too many questions? Yes, after 111 days, the RHI inquiry has finished taking oral evidence. So far the inquiry has cost &#163;4.6 million. 4.6 million quid to find out that our politicians are useless. Who knew? To be fair, there has been some shocking evidence. We've learnt about the blatant breaches of ministerial codes, civil service incompetence, lapses in governance and most importantly of all, we learnt that when Jonathan Bell is pissed, his go-to song is Breakfast At Tiffany's. Imagine that - a DUP minister who was so blocked he couldn't even remember the words to The Sash. But who can we blame for asking too many questions? You can't blame your wee chairman, the wee guy, Sir Patrick Coghlin. God love him, what he's had to listen to - 60 witnesses, 111 days, a million pages of evidence, and what have we learnt? Arlene Foster didn't read the RHI bill before she brought it to the Assembly. Worse still, her memory is so bad I wouldn't trust her to find the toilet by herself. As the civil servants, civil servants who we pay, didn't bother taking notes. If you've a pigeon club, you take notes. They didn't take notes. Wee civil servant... "What are you doing, son?" "I'm taking notes." "Put your notebook away, son. "Hear no evil, see no evil, think to evil, son." I have to talk about the Ballymena One. It would be wrong not to talk about the Ballymena One. What is this country coming to when an MP can't accept a couple of luxury family holidays from a repressive regime and just ask a couple of questions of the Prime Minister without getting dragged in, pulled over the coals? And he was put out for 30 days, put out for 30 days from Westminster while Westminster was on holiday! So after two years of no government, after two years of no government, we have failed politicians who are still getting paid, we have failed civil servants who are still getting paid, we have failed Spads who will get paid but most importantly, we have learnt, we have learnt that Ian Paisley Jr could be filmed singing The Soldier's Song while getting a massage from a Bangkok ladyboy and he would still keep his job! APPLAUSE It was a family holiday, Ian Paisley didn't bring Edwin Poots because with those ears he would have been shot by poachers in Sri Lanka. If you're taking notes at a pigeon club, is that technically a tweet? Wahey! Come on! RHI, you probably haven't been following it because you have a life, but basically the RHI... Basically you have no heating. You're doing a show called Riches To Rags, basically the RHI has done the same to Northern Ireland. They've basically lost millions. Were you the same? Yeah, because, I grew up in a castle for the first 15 years of my life. Yeah. Snap! It's quite similar because my parents were very posh and very eccentric, which, thank goodness, had they been working class and eccentric I'd have been taken into care. They were very posh but we didn't have any money, so we lived in a castle that had no under-floor heating. The only way to keep warm was to hope the cat pissed in your bed. It was... Give the cat more water! We didn't have things. I was reading the Ulster Gazette, as I often do. There was actually an ad that popped up for ArmaTile. Have you seen this? ArmaTile, A-R-M-A tile. Which is dodgy enough, cos if you're dyslexic that's Armalite. Yep. This ad popped up, but the story was about Armagh jail. Have you seen this? Armagh jail, it was meant to be refurbished into a hotel but there will be a long delay, but it will be a jail-themed hotel. Would you stay in a jail-themed hotel? "Mr McGarry, welcome along, you're going to stay with us for six "nights, the last two suspended. "I see you're staying in the Gerry Kelly Suite. "OK, it's like a normal room but you have to check out "in the middle of the night on a bread van. "Oh, there's an upgrade available to the Michaella McCollum Room, "which is the same as the normal room but the mini-bar only has coke." The horrible story, that wee rat, do you remember the poor woman died and he had the flat above her flat and he didn't tell anybody and he had her credit card and was buying a pizza every day for two years, pizza every day? It was a horrible story, but I don't know about you, when I saw that on the news and saw him, all I could think was, why is he so skinny? How is he so skinny?! Speaking of culinary delights, I'll maybe get you the Gerry Adams cookbook for Christmas. He launched his cookbook this week. Launch is not the right word to use. Gerry Adams launched nothing. We've already established this, several times. Most of the recipes basically start with, "Set your timer". Most of them start that way. Does Gerry actually like cooking? No, they cook for Gerry. I had an image of Gerry's kitchen, like, the island isn't partitioned. It's got all the posh cutlery except steak knives. We have to talk about the very sad fire in Primark, &#163;2 million in the budget this week. People are still upset. Primark has become Belfast's Diana. Is it too soon? It's too soon, sorry. Are you saying that Prince Philip set Primark on fire? I'm not saying anything, you know. But I've been down there and it's very weird, you forget about it, you walk around the corner and the hoardings are there and people are standing with a wee tear in their eye, laying a wee bunch of flowers. Once they start removing all the rubble out of that place, "Oh, my God, I wouldn't like the motorway that day, "there will be trucks, people on the flyover throwing flowers." We used to have a whole lot of things for Christmas. This is typical of us - when it's gone we're very upset and angry, but when it was there, did we give it any respect? No, we were all in there picking up jeans going, "Nah!" "T-shirt for two quid? That's too dear." Thank you. So what's our next question tonight? Who do you blame for bordering on the ridiculous? MPs have been told one of the major items now being smuggled across the border is washing powder. Apparently it's used by criminals to launder their money. GROANS They say washing powder is being smuggled. I'm not so sure, I'm not saying the PSNI are useless but I reckon some drug dealers have been caught with a lot of white powder and just told the peelers it was Daz. But who can we blame for bordering on the ridiculous? I think... I think it has all become ridiculous, Brexit has become like an actual joke, do you know what I mean? An Englishman, a Scotsman, an Irishman walk into a pub. The Englishman decides to leave so we've all got to BLEEP off. I don't know, I seem to be referendum'd out, we're talking about a second Brexit referendum, we're talking about, there's a second talk of an indy ref in Scotland. It's like we're having more referendums than you're having any decisions made in your own parliament. It's... I don't know about how you feel about the Brexit thing. I was a proper one-man, one-woman, whatever... Transgender. ..on the independence movement. I was like a proper... And we're going to get a second one and I'm going to go out again. But I was literally, people just in the street, getting at them, what are you voting? What are you voting? The day before the referendum I spoke to a woman in the bus stop, said, "What are you voting?" "I don't know, dear." I was like, can you make a decision, it's the day before the referendum? She said, "I don't know," so I spent the entire bus journey... By the end of it I'd completely converted her to Islam. Which, when I think of it now, she had a look of Sinead O'Connor about her. That's... Piece of advice... Don't go around Northern Ireland going, "Who do you vote for?" The people of Northern Ireland, they give you a warm glow in their heart. Newsnight did a survey, they went around the United Kingdom saying, what did people think about Brexit. They went to Scotland, they went to various parts of England and people said, "We're getting our sovereignty back, immigration will be dealt with," and they came to Northern Ireland and they said to this guy, "What do you think of Brexit?" "Lot of bollocks." Why can't we vote for your president? We can't vote for Mickey D. As soon as you learn how to say the Taoiseach's name, you can vote for our president. The one good line to come out of it was Robin Swann. "At last I have a president I can look in the eye." Jacob Rees-Mogg, how has he lived and survived so long? How did he survive school? Because they're all like that. He would not have survived in my school. Bullying is not right. He didn't go to your school. You could not have bullied him, there would be a ballot, you would have had to win to get a go at him. They're all called things like that, they are genuinely. When I was at school and I'm sorry, and I apologise, I'm so glad that everything went wrong because I would have been an absolute unmitigated arsehole if life had continued the way it was, but when I was at school I was at school with people called Rumpty Lowther-Pinkerton. I'm not kidding. That's what I call my penis. Too many words. One of my best friends was called Pixie Balfour Pole. That's tattooed on the underside. There's a lot of people turning up at the Irish Embassy now to get passports. It's a good embassy to go to. It's better than going to the Saudi embassy, for example, you don't want to do that. I got propositioned in a lift in Dubai which... I didn't know, I'd never been to the Middle East before, this guy said to me, "What floor?" I said, "Floor four, thanks very much." "Where are you from?" "Scotland." "He said, "Vacation?" I said, "No, working." He said, "Good, what's your room number?" I know! He thought I was a prostitute. I was just like, I got all flustered because I had no idea what to charge! Thank you very much for that. Talking of bordering on the ridiculous, despite all the evidence, Saudi Arabia continually denied it had anything to do with the murder of a journalist. Indeed, they issued so many ridiculous denials even Gerry Adams was scundered for them. Yes, Saudi Arabia has been criticised over many years over its human rights record. So it's only a matter of time before Ian Paisley goes there on holiday. What's our next question tonight? Our next question is who do you blame for illegitimate targets? Yes, new hard hitting adverts have been broadcast depicting paramilitaries and so-called punishment shootings. Northern Ireland, the only part of the world where actors have publicity photographs of themselves wearing balaclavas. "Yes, that was me, Provo number two." Also this week, a stag was shot dead in East Belfast. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I hope the fiancee kept the receipt for her wedding dress. It was an actual animal stag. The stag wasn't actually a danger to itself or others, but Translink had it shot dead when it wandered into the Glider bus lane. But who can we blame for illegitimate targets? This is the only part of the world that we need to be told, "See paramilitaries, they're not all that, you know." Seriously, I was watching the ad - who's this for? They're supposed to be for the mums. "Don't be driving your sons to get shot." Typically here it's the women doing all the bloody work. "I suppose I have to drive him to get shot, you're sitting there watching the bloody football again." "Get your coat. It's your da they should be shooting." The ad is, if you haven't seen them, there are four different ads, done from different point of views. One of them, the camera is from the point of view of the mother, or the son going to get shot, or the guy doing the shooting, or from a witness. They're done from four different angles, same ad. They're quite good ads actually. But the ad is, a woman driving along with the son. You don't know what it's for, initially, you've no idea, just lots of heavy breathing, kind of weird. The one I saw was the young lad's point of view, he's coming downstairs, panting, he's got his phone. And then his mother is there, "Have you got your coat? Come on, let's go. "You don't want to get cold when you're getting shot." Then they get in the car and they're driving down the road and there's silence. Thank God there's not Cool FM or something on - that would be worse, you'd be looking forward to getting shot. "Shout out to all the crew in Ards." "Just do it now, just do it now." Basically it's, paramilitaries, they don't care about you. The line should be, "dump them". It's just the weirdest thing, who are the ads for? Are they to stop people doing this? Bringing their kids to get shot? Is it for them? It is certainly not for the people getting shot, they're at home going, "I don't fancy the look of that." Is it for the people who are shooting, is it for the people at home doing the shooting sitting there going, "Actually, now that I look at it in the cold light of day... "You need a bit of distance, it's a bit harsh." It's not realistic. It's the teenage boys. The ma will be going, "Sean, Sean, get up, son, you're going to be late. "He'll be late for his own funeral, that child, I swear to God." And there's no sound in the car driving down. There's no way a Northern Irish mother would be driving her son to get kneecapped, and not bang his ears in. "I told you your whole life, it's going to happen to you, and now it's going to happen. "If you had listened to me. I told you..." APPLAUSE The stag wandered in off the Comber Greenway, a disused railway line, now a cycle path, it wandered in and ended up in East Belfast and was wandering around East Belfast and reports say it was agitated. That's cos it was in East Belfast. And it said it was very dangerous because it's rutting season. I thought, "In East Belfast? Is it rutting season in East Belfast?" There are spides everywhere going, "Argh!" Walking around with erections and trackies on. They said it was a menace to traffic. At 3.00 in the morning? You knew that was a taxi driver going, "There was an old deer "in the middle of the road, I had to go round it." So they rang the cops, the cops turned up, and the cops said they tried to corral it but it was getting more and more agitated and they shot it. It's worst weekend of the year to shoot someone. This is a stag. There's a good chance you would shoot the stag and you'd hear, "Aagh! Agh! "I have to go to a party!" Or a pissed Santa comes out of a hedge after having a pee going... "Is that Davie and Robert?" Oh, in Holywood, was it Holywood at the weekend? There were ructions, absolute ructions. There was to be a massive, massive fireworks display, possibly an extravaganza. It may be too harsh a word, but I think possibly, and it had to be cancelled at the last moment. 8,000 people were there, do you know what I mean? 8,000 people turned up to watch this fireworks extravaganza that was going to be launched from Belfast Lough on this boat, this barge they put out. What happened was, the tide went out. It does that quite a lot. It does it twice a day, every single day. The people who organised said, "It went very, very low." You think, "Really?" Do you believe that? I would say what happens they got a phone call from somebody in Derry going, "They've taken all our fireworks." Thank you very much for that, time for our quickfire round, I will read you various newspaper headlines and I want you to be faster than someone from Derry telling you how great Halloween is in Derry. You like dressing up, we get it. Not the best names for twins. Because they all have type two diabetes. Says Popeye. I think that's called an act of God. Finally... Thrush. That's it, ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of the show. Please show your appreciation to our panel, Colin Murphy, Jojo Sutherland, Jake O'Kane and Neil Delamere. CHEERING I'm... I'm Tim McGarry. Until next time, don't blame yourselves, blame each other. Goodbye.
