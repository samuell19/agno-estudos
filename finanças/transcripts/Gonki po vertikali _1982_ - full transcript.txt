Hey, are you crazy? Found a place early in the morning! Well, what are you staring at? You know that I hate it when they look at me in a dream. And when to look at you? Wake up - run away again. - Well then, I went. - Wait. Do not rush. Have you seen Senka Bakum for a long time? - Recently. And what? - Yes, you need to see. I want to talk with him. No, he won’t talk to you. Why not? Talking to you. You will not understand. Better not to meet him. Explain, I do not understand. You left him, not me. He continues to talk with you. When a person loves, he forgives a lot. Perhaps forgive me, I do not see my guilt. I didn’t buy you at the market either. He loves me ... Just do not make a loving prince from Baku! - Bakuma is a thief! - Yes, he is not a thief now! Thief! And who, saint, or what? He is a driver. Works in a taxi. Bakuma is a driver! Do not make me laugh. Yes, the driver. He showed me a passport. Yes, I will show you three passports and all with different surnames! Yes, he showed me one, the real one, one last name. How do you know that he is real? Yes, his hands are not the same, understand? - Hands? - The drivers. Oh my God. And here you are. I barely found you. Tell me, Sasha, have you ever wanted to get married? Why so? I wanted to. The girl was very beautiful. But she only talked to me like this: "You trampled large and clean, you defiled the holy ...". - So what? - I had to quit. Clear. And your future children will begin to learn music? - No never. - Why? Now players are cheap. You are right. Now write down ... To send a request to the information card file: Sytnikov Aristarkh Evgrafovich. Convicted in 1946 in the case of Ataman Semenov. There is. Aristarch. It’s interesting how the children in the yard called him as a child ... Arik? Or ristica? No, most likely Starhun. You are tramp, Alexander. Aristarch Sytnikov in the yard with the guys did not play ... He was brought up in the Page Corps. Two worlds - two destinies. I was also brought up in vocational school No. 169. By the way, why are you interested in this fossil page? He's not a page, he's a staff captain. And the only survivor of the entire Semen company. Is that all? No more questions? Not. Rather, there is. The girl called you here. - Lena? - Well no. What is Lena? Lyudmila Mikhailovna. And just in case I left my phone. - Not necessary. I have. - Perfectly. I said that you will call her later. Bye then. Yes, yes, I'm listening ... Mila, good afternoon. That Tikhonov is bothering you. Remember, I came to you about General von Dietz? I called you today. I just got it. You know, we found the documents, from which it follows that the last Dietz there were two nieces: Maria Genrikhovna Elizabeth Genrikhovna von Ditz. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. “You help us a lot.” - Well, what are you. We will certainly find them. If we go like this, I will really become famous soon. Well, good. - Honey. - Yes? Tell me, no one is waiting for you today after work? No, no one is waiting. It's fine. It is wonderful, that no one is waiting for you after work. Why is it wonderful? Well, I can’t immediately say why. - Let's see you today. - Let's. If it’s not difficult for you, come to Trubnaya Square. I will be waiting for you there. Good. And why on Trubnaya? It is easy to explain. I saw a dream today that I am waiting for you at Pipe Square. And you do not come and do not come. - Will you come? - Yes, I’ll come. Where to Trubnaya? Well, to where I saw you in a dream. Good, but I haven’t seen you. There at the beginning of the boulevard there are black vases or ... lights, here beside these vases I will wait for ace. - Good. “So at six?” “Then at six.” - See you. - All the best. Thank. What do you need? Oh, I’ll upgrade! So, am I going to greet you now? Gonosh all I do not chase. Why are you driving a car? Take a foot. I’ll press it now, you’ll limp. Press, dear. After all, it was always a law of thieves ... At the sidekick in the Khaz fly into the trap. To trash me was better to take. What do you want? Of money. ...How many? - Well, nothing, there’s nothing to talk about. Will the steward arrange? Bakuma, what are you? Is a hundred rubles money? For these "money" I have been hunching for two weeks behind the wheel. Hunting is more than captivity. Okay. How much do you need, talk and roll off. Half of your fleet’s revenue. In one day, of course. And where are you going to get the other half? I'll give it to you. I'm not greedy - take it, take advantage of your health. Thousand and ten are your share, without trifles. Will you accept the little things? As I look, you're still the same joker. And what? Nothing, play a joke. Take you over again ... Listen, maybe now I should call you “citizen the head of Bakum”? Maybe you’re the boss at the trash yourself? You will now snatch the revolver from the curve: "Hands up, you are detained, citizen Dedushkin!" Get up! The court is coming! Baton is three years old, and the cop Bakume ... Thirty pieces of silver in the old way, and in a new way - three rubles! If you want - listen to me, if you want - no. But knit, Baton, before it's too late. Okay, the horseradish apostle better tell me where is my instrument? You're a train thief, maidannik, or decided to remember youth? Where's the tool, lousy bitch? Hush. Here are the neighbors. I do not know where your instrument is! I did not take it! And come on from here! Remember only: If they come to me from the criminal, I can’t see freedom for ages - I’ll pledge you for the whole. For you, you bastard, I’m reluctant to puff the colonies! Well, dear sidekick, I remember. And thanks for the welcome, for the caress. Well, you know me - I will return the favor, with a feather in addition. - Hello. - Hello. - This is for you. - Thank. - Come on? - Yeah. - Where? - Somewhere. You do not want to eat? Awful. And, in my opinion, you too. Yes. And I do not remember my father. Absolutely. Well, that is, some of the most vague memories ... I was three years old when he died. I only remember that he loved to drag me on shoulders. I especially in childhood nothing I was not afraid, except for Karabas-Barabas, of course. This was the scariest figure. So he carried me on his shoulders and read poetry. Each time different, he invented them. Well, something like ... We’ll tie our hands, take off his trousers, let's put him to him ... what's there ... To remember Karabas, the boy Stas is not afraid. Something like that. - Wonderful poems. - Yes, beautiful. I liked the most that we will pour this Karabas. I don’t even know if I loved my father, because ... did you manage, or rather, to fall in love. And mother later ... He was very jealous of her stepfather. This is now beginning to understand what it is, in general, cruel childish selfishness. And then I just hated my stepfather. I, in my opinion, spoke to you completely, right? - Not. - Let's drink. - Let's. With pleasure. - For what? - I do not know. Let's drink ... - So. - Behind... Behind? Well, for what? - For ... - Let's know what we will drink for? Because today you still came to Trubnaya Square. Because there are archives and archivists on Earth. - Famous. - We have no celebrities. Speaking arrogant, then you conserve time. True? We’ll drink to the conservatives. We have a public commission on room cleanliness, compete for the title of the floor of high culture. And this whole day does not leave the room. And when to do spring cleaning? Though stay after work. I only pulled out a lot of bottles after him, such beautiful bottles, big ones. And where have you divided the bottles? How to where? Threw out! What are they for? Imported do not accept. Well, yes, Claudia Vasilievna, and you took out bottles as draining or after leaving all at once? After departure, of course, but how can it be? You took out, then, all the bottles and where are they? In the garbage chute. I threw it away, where else. Oh, priests, you reminded me. I mean, Zina from the twelfth floor promised two bottles. For caustic. Well, well, well! And where are the bottles? Yes, if they didn’t throw it out, they should be on duty. After all, they are comfortable - a cork with a screw, here Zina asked me, but she herself cast a ballot. Come on. Claudia Vasilievna, but you didn’t notice did your tenant get drunk often? But how can I tell you - it was not visible on it. Oh there they are. Oh, great. Caution. Now I will wipe them with a cloth. In no case, Claudia Vasilievna, then I have to buy a full bottle and get drunk. And I can’t, I have an ulcer. May I take this package? - And rubber gloves. - Yeah. Perfectly. Except you, nobody touched these bottles? But the demon knows them. I pulled them out to the garbage chute, and I put these two here. It seems that they are standing in the same place ... We will ask you after work drop by at 38 Petrovka Street. Literally for ten minutes. Only fingerprint to distinguish on the bottle. Listen, my worries are full of mouth. I can not. Claudia Vasilievna, you my dear, I think I have this entertainment ... To go to hotels and collect bottles? Also imported, which no one accepts. Well, if you need ... That's just the point, what you need. Tell me, you talked to him ... Actually, how does he speak Russian? So-so - from the fifth to the tenth. But you can understand. Did he do anything? What happened? It happened. The suitcase was stolen from him. Suitcase? Oh my God. Wait, don't close. Oh, come. I thought you would never come. - What kind of wind? - What ... Associated. I suppose there was a case nearby. Nothing like this. - He put it aside to you. “So I believed you.” And what is this young lady? - New talent? - Yes, talent. Have you already learned the Lark? You can’t be without barbs, right? Why are you wasting time on them, mom? Do you need this money? Humanity lacks aesthetic education. What is missing? Aesthetic education. Take off your jacket. Thank. Sneaky. With such beliefs, mom ... you need to do this for free. I must feel my need. And what is the main measure of necessity? Money. And so, are you right or wrong - nobody will pay a dime. Sit down, I will feed. - I had a lunch. “So you'll be having dinner.” Sit down. Oh, the banquet. So. Well, start with that, okay? I don’t know anything about you now. How do you live? I am afraid for you. They’re afraid of me. I live normally. Today, like 8 years ago, catching the same crook nicknamed Baton. Do you like it? - What about bread? - Yes, sorry. - And salt, mom! - Yes! Thank. So everything is in order with work. That this is your calling, yes? Quietly. You and I talked a lot about this topic. Yes. Offensive. You know, yesterday Vadik Petrichenko came ... Who? - He came from Brussels. - A. Shmotok brought? Stop it. I went to the contest and became a laureate. - Congratulations. - Me with what? - How with what? The teacher of the laureate. Do not be shy. He started at you. Thank. It's a shame. A man has become a laureate, but are you offended? Do not play the fool. You know what I'm talking about. About me, huh? Mom, I do my best I could not become a pianist - I have no hearing. Did you hear how I played right now? Please tell me honestly. Is that really your calling ... Digging in someone else's mud? You will be silent now. Well, what can I answer you? You better tell me what ... Why are you complaining to me about Lena? “I'm not complaining at all.” - Yes? Yes. I just said that you rarely visit me. I don’t see you at all. Well, let's say the truth. Why talk about this to a completely stranger? So an outsider. But I know that more recently ... Well, mom, okay, get it. We broke up with her once and for all. Finally and irrevocably. I don’t want you to tell her about my personal life. After all, you talked to her not only about that I rarely visit you, right? Well, to be honest. Listen, I'm not at your interrogation, right? I know that you just recently a completely different opinion was about her. Now I will bring more cakes. This Castelli is an employee of BRT. Well, it's kind of a salesman traveling around the world. Nothing suspicious behind him unnoticed. The rest of the company is also employees of this company. Except for the girl. Photos taken in Yalta in April. In the beginning of April. The whole company lived in a hotel in Yalta. What about the girl? A girl from Moscow. Antipova Olga Evgenievna. No specific activities. - What tells? - Nothing interesting. - That is, as? - Well, like this. Nothing at all. I met these foreigners, they know little. One name is Fau, this is our Fausto Castelli. The second is Bobby and the third is Harry. The last two in Russian are not boom boom. Well for malomalsky investigation still need some kind of common line, one kind of canvas. Nothing at all here. Shreds, just some scraps. You yourself said that Castelli goes back and forth, that means he can appear again with us. Maybe, maybe. So what? He did not say at the border that the suitcase was missing. What are our chances that he will announce this time? Of course, I can prove that his suitcase. I'll prove it, I will definitely do it. But how do we prove that he acquired the order here? And most importantly - what is illegal? Only then will some thread appear. Develop the story further with Sytnikov and the order. This is the key to success. - Good. - Come in. Sorry, here's a telegram. From Zagorsk about Sytnikov. So what? You will laugh, but he, alas, died. - When? - A week ago. Yes, history ... Hello, this is again Captain Tikhonov. What about my help? Ditz Maria Genrikhovna. Yeah. Clear. Zerechesnsk. Moscow region. Yeah. Lev Tolstoy? 29. Thank you. Oh wait a minute! Tell me how to get there better. By water, "Missile automatic." Thank. - I'm listening. - Mila? - Yes. - Hello. Hello. “Do you recognize me?” - Yes, I will. Perfectly. Tell me, I had a thought here ... How do you feel about walking on the water? I am great for walks on the waters. Although I have never committed them. - Not once? - Not once. And where are we going? How on what? On a white ship, of course. On white? On the river, I hope? - Unfortunately. “Well, why unfortunately?” But because if there were oceanic, I would invite you to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiian Islands? Hawaiian Ukuleles are very beautiful and constantly sound there. Perfectly. On the river. Persuaded? - Persuaded. “So, see you tomorrow?” Till tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. Well, canceled the trip? Why is canceled? Well, the weather ... Not. The match will take place in any weather. - Oh well. - Let's go. Wow May, huh? I’ve been tormented by some the same wacky dream. You know, in Gorky Park - there is such an attraction. - "Racing vertically." Igor Ivanov. Do not know? No, I have Izmailov next to me. “I only go there.” - Well, okay. And I studied with this Igor in the same class, therefore, I know him well. So I dream of him planting me on my motorcycle, accelerates it, and I begin to race along this closed vertical. Along this wall. Top down. I'm screaming scary. It's just some kind of nightmare. What is it for? You know, I was told that dreams it is an intuitive comprehension of real life. Well, that’s understandable, but it’s not easier for me. Or maybe you can try to materialize a dream, how then, on Trubnaya? What do you suggest? Sit on a motorcycle and rush? Well, at least maybe see how this is done. Have you been there for a long time? I’ve never been there, I’ve only seen a poster. Igor Ivanov. Where are we from? - I hope that in Zarechensk. - Why? Ex-Baroness von Ditz lives here. “You are an insidious person.” - Why? Lured the girl on a business trip, but I imagined ... White ship walking on the waters. Well, what if life is so short you have to combine business with pleasure. Inspection Protocol: - The window is closed. On the table. - leftover food in a plate, bottle with tomato juice. The cabinet is small. The body on the couch, signs of violent death were not found. Well ... the kingdom of heaven, as they say. Used beaver short coat, highly worn straw hat, soiled, the chairs are old, the couch is old. Table forks - three. Savings book in the name of Sytnikov, contribution - 144 rubles 84 kopecks. Yellow metal locket ivory cameo. Two silver candlesticks. Five kilograms each. You see, escheated property subject to circulation of state revenue. And here, for the most part, trash, all junk no one wants. So we destroyed it. What, and all the furniture was burned? What kind of furniture is there ... The couch is pushed through, lame table, three broken chairs and some kind of ridiculous locker. And no relatives, applicants for this inheritance never showed up. So we destroyed everything, limited ourselves seizure of values. But you found some very valuable things, really no one had enough elementary human curiosity thoroughly inspect everything else? Lord ... Well, in my opinion, they have come. “I think it's here.” - Wow. - Well, let's go together? “No, I'll wait here.” Good. - This is not to be bored. - Thank. You are welcome. Who's there? Hello. Excuse me, does Maria Genrikhovna von Ditz live here? “Ah, Maria Genrikhovna lives here.” - I'm from the police. - Please pass. - Thank. Just be careful, it's dark here. Please come in. And your cloak can be hung here. You know first this whole house belonged to our family, and then ... we were given these two rooms. Rather, one and a half. And then thanks to my late husband. “Yes, you sit down, please.” - Thank. He was a red commander. Such was the time that ... Noblest man. You know, from the blacksmith’s family, and graduated with honors from high school. Your uncle, in my opinion, also fought in those parts? Do you mean Baron von Ditz? - Yes. - Yes, this is our uncle. Maria Genrikhovna, please tell me Does the name of Sytnikov say nothing to you? Sytnikov? Well then ... You know, he was an adjutant with Uncle. And, after the conclusion, he even lived with us for a while. - So I'm not Maria Genrikhovna. - How? - I'm Elizabeth Genrikhovna. - Sorry. And Maria Genrikhovna is my sister. She went to the grocery store and is about to return. But your last name is Ditz? No, my husband’s last name is Boyko. Clear. Elizaveta Genrikhovna, I'm interested in everything related to Sytnikov. Understand. Sytnikov. Marie, dear, and we have guests with the police. He is interested in Aristarkh Evgrafovich. - Hello. - Hello. Your sister has already satisfied my curiosity to some extent. Well, again, did something wrong? “Didn’t please you again?” - No, no, do not worry. We just have troubles about the inheritance of the deceased. He has no relatives, but some values ​​remained. In particular, the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called. A rare thing, dear, the highest order of Russia. And we found out that in the last century this order was awarded to General Baron von Ditz. - Yes, yes, this is our grandfather. - Shut up. What do you want from us? If I, forced by circumstance, ceded this order to Aristarkh Evgrafovich, what is the crime here? Oh well, God be with you. This is not the case at all. Just the things that go to the state’s fund, must be, as we say, "clean." And here we are wondering if you have any proper claims to the deceased. No, no complaints. Why I ask, you could not sell him this order, and give for preservation, for example. Or ask to rate somewhere. Well, it could be, right? And Sytnikov at that time took and died. Not. We have no complaints against him. That's great. Thank. If you may, one more question. So, out of idle curiosity. What do you think, why would he need this order? Well, how do we know that? Or maybe as a memory of his uncle? After all, he was his adjutant. - Quite understandable ... - Well, right, of course. You never know what happens in life. And I always think where he got so much money from. - And how much - so much? - Honestly. - At least 10 thousand, at least. - Oh! - Ten? - What ten thousand? Yes, we have not seen such money for 60 years. “Do you think less?” - Well, of course. Order with a star, studded with diamonds. 10 thousand is just a gift. Firstly, there were almost no diamonds on the star. And secondly, you apparently think that there were quality stones on the cross? Only high quality. I am a convinced enemy of tsarism, but, unfortunately, I have to admit that the stones were clear water. It’s strange. And who told you that they are substandard? Is Aristarkh Evgrafovich really? They don’t speak badly about the dead but if so, then he simply cheated on you. Oh, my God! Marie! And how much did he pay you, if not a secret? We are glad. I ask because the state would pay you much more. I repeat: We are satisfied. And your statement, I'm sorry, we do not believe. Marie We have every reason for this. How can you do that, Marie? The young man is really right. - I’m Arista when I was young ... - Lisa, shut up! Arist, are you talking? Yes. We called him that - Arist. Thank. All the best. Hello. Tell me, please, did Sytnikov chew here? - Here. - There, yes? Thank. Girl, please tell me where is the room of the late Sytnikov? - There. - Thank. Over there, huh? Yes. When I came here with a viewing order, there was nothing here - empty. And in general, no one will tell you anything sensible. You know, the rooms are separate, and because of this extremely low sociability. Masha! Masha! Well, carry it! No thanks, I just had lunch. Not. Dine, we are simple people ... But hospitable. You know, my grandfather said: It is good when the food is simple but healthy. Masha, come on. I beg you, do not offend. Maria Nikolaevna, please tell me when you no one was interested in Sytnikov? Well, if anyone was interested, she would tell me first of all. She's disciplined, not like the others. Do you know what wives are now? Tell me, maybe with the neighbors talk maybe they saw people who came to Sytnikov? To talk? You can talk, but it's useless. Yes, they have already reported to you. The inputs are mostly isolated. Well, therefore, sociability is extremely low. He was recently asked by some young man. And you didn’t tell me anything like that. Masha, how? You didn’t tell me anything! Maria Nikolaevna, you say. A week ago. I worked the second shift that day. In the morning, at 10 o'clock, the doorbell rang. I opened, saw - well, a man, young. - Incredible. - Interesting, well-dressed. He asked Sytnikov. I explained to him that Sytnikov died, and they brought us into his room. He said goodbye and left. Is that all? Didn't say anything else? Nothing. He looks kind of upset. Well, should he be glad, or what? Maybe this is his friend. Or maybe even a relative. Please be silent for a moment, please. Tell me, how is he in Russian? spoke without a foreign accent? Nothing. This is how we are. Tell me, maybe one of the neighbors Some Sytnikov’s property left? Look, who needs this junk right now? We threw it all away. Here is this lamp and table. Little. Oh yes. There he stood in the corridor. Well rubbish. Absolute rubbish. I'm still not going to throw it away. Excuse me, can I inspect him? You are welcome. He is rubbish. Full junk. - Without a box, right? - Yes. No drawer. - What are the boxes here, here, admire. - Well yes. What is it? - The cabinetry fad. - Is it really a cache? Probably hide cigarettes from his wife. Let's see what's inside. Wow. Masha, what is this? Just look! Masha! And what old ones. And then, when I was 13 years old, when these methods no longer fit Mom has changed tactics. She resorted to another - to tears. For any reason, she cried. Just a little - you'll be a janitor and I will die under the fence. Why janitor, why under the fence - it is not clear. When I already started to work in MUR, she made a scandal for me. She sobbed for two weeks. In my opinion, she still has not calmed down. And I can’t imagine any other work. It seems to me under no circumstances I would not leave her. You say that as if you were warning me. - I warn you? - Yeah. Well what are you. Although ... why not warn. It seems to me that with us ... Or does it just seem to me? - Unfortunately, it does not seem. - Why "Unfortunately? Because ... unfortunately. And in my opinion, fortunately. I am lucky. Everything will be fine. I am sure about that. Well, admire what our Ristik is. What is our old bunker. Your imagination is poor and wretched, Alexander. Neither Ristic, nor Starhunya, but Arist. - Briefly and clearly. - How do you know? - The old women told. - Well, to summarize. Do you like this occupation, look. - Love. Come on. - Okay. Sytnikov, God's old man from Zagorsk, bought from old women from the former different heirlooms that are now of great value. Rings, brooches, expensive old books, letters of great people ... Well, everything that I could buy, and sold to your young, interesting, whom Masha from Zagorsk saw. And what, bought up only from old women? Didn’t you buy from the Starichkovs? Only old women the old people by that time had all died out. Apparently, then the slogan was not so popular: "Take care of men." So why did he sell only the cross? Did not sell everything at once: Cross and star. Why? Maybe he sold both. - Is this the 1825th? - Yes. Sold, maybe both of them, but your young and handsome foreigner sold only a cross. - Why? “But the devil knows him.” Maybe because the star silver and there are almost no diamonds on it. Yes, may be. Listen, maybe it has value from collectors? Well, they are buying up old brands for crazy money. Who collects the orders? Numismatists? No, numismatists collect coins. Well, the orders? Dismiss. That’s what, Stas ... We’ll go to the general right now. The baton rolled a cart on you ... Wow! And should Tikhonov make excuses? Do not make excuses, but he must explain to the authorities. What and how do they have the right to ask, eh? Tikhonov must prove that he is not a camel, if it is claimed by a thief and, a reptile, a repeat offender? Yes, a thief, but we have not yet proved it by law. So he is a citizen like everyone else and he has rights no less than yours. - Even more. - Sure. Good complaint? Yes, well written. Yes, he’s an intelligent guy. Addressed to MK, copies to the city prosecutor and the head of the department. Are you afraid Why be afraid, just disgusting to justify oneself. Is this all serious? Complaint is a complaint. Then he presses that you used illegal interrogation methods on him. Persuaded to admit, then, they say, you let him go. Oleg Nikolaevich called us, how is he? Yes, please come in. Hello. Come in at 18 o’clock. Come in, sit down. Sit down. Lebedev reports. Unfortunately, there is no new data yet. So we threw the best forces there, for implementation. What? Well, my people have been sitting there in ambush for a week without a shift. And only the weather forecast works without errors. They are for you, and you wash my neck. So it’s not cast iron ... Here we take it, and the public will calm down ... Yes, yes, I obey. At 15:00 I will report again. Well? Yes ... The complaint against you, Tikhonov, has arrived ... I am surprised ... I think that if from a thief recidivist I received thanks, you would be even more surprised. Anything can happen. And thanks come. I think that I can’t wait from Grandfather. Did you really threaten? You could say that. He promised to put him in jail. Why are you so at odds? I must say, I would gladly rubbed your tongue with pepper. But it’s not necessary to scold you that you promised Baton to be jailed. And for the fact that he did not fulfill his threats. You can not - do not poke around. What turns out ... Rogue watering my inspectors I must write novels by prosecutors about your accounts with Grandfather. Have you waved your tongue to the side? - Why to the side? - You shut up, do not interrupt. I would show you where the crayfish hibernate if not for one circumstance ... When did you last deal with Baton? Eight years ago. Sentenced to five years. Why do you think he wrote a complaint about you? I don’t know, revenge, probably. I really worked with him biased ... The baton is afraid of you. Therefore, the complaint relied on the emphasis on removing you from the investigation. Moreover, you will give him a reason without proving his guilt. But look, Stas, if it turns out in the end, that he was afraid in vain ... then you know yourself. Prepare a case file. It will be required for the prosecutor. Okay, you are free. To her. No, this is not good. Give this one. Here's the one that’s fluffy. No, the one nearby. This is good. I'll come back later. Soft. Thank. - Bright, please. - This one? Yes. - Are you getting free? - Sit down. Thank. - Who's there? - Own. We have all our homes. Who is it? And this is you. You should have come earlier. Come on in. Khe khe. The flu was tortured. Listen, Shaman, you are rich. Why do you need money if you live in such squalor? And who are you to count my wealth? I did not invite you to executives. I just figured out how much I had dragged to you. and how much you should have left ... What happened was gone, and what was left is mine. Why did you come to me? Yes, I wanted to gossip with you, but something doesn’t start our conversation. A conversation is not a knot on a bag to tie. You say why you came, and go yourself. I’m not your company. A goose is not a pig. Look how you talked something. Only I'm not a goose, but an eagle. And you are the most recent dog pig, if you meet a comrade like that. We were comrades. And now I lead a quiet life, permitted by law, I do not need earnings from you. Shaman, did you even get involved? What did it all attack you like the Hong Kong flu? Look, maybe you became a member of a union? And what? And the newsletter is put to me, and leave ... Everything is like people have. Do you want to pay a contribution from old earnings? Who knows about them, about the old? Oh you. And there is no reason to do more miner-maher. Got it You won’t have time to use the accumulated ... Rake you to hell. Turning pebbles or felling a forest. That's how I see you burning your life. "Use the accumulated." What about women? I don’t need it. It's time to think about the soul. Okay, tied up? Where do you work? At the veterinary clinic. A nurse, or what? Nope, by car. We catch stray cats and dogs. Why are you looking at me like that? I don’t look at you looking at you is disgusting. Yeah, disgusting! And work is like work, and better than yours! Got it ?! Dogs do not mind? Sorry. I took one, feed it. - And kitties? - Kitty? Not! When I catch cats, as if with you, reptiles thieves, even! The habits are the same no thanks - one force yes greed is stupid! But why did we annoy you? You, like a leech, fed from us. And how much fear have I endured? - I was always afraid of the police. - Okay, but you are even more forest. You always considered my money more than once, they probably wanted me by the throat and here to play me in the room. And now - no, it won’t work out. I have nothing! And I’ll die - you won’t get a penny. So here, not a penny! You are a fool, and crazy, moreover.
