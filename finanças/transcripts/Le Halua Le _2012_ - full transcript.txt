"Have fun. Have fun." "Have fun. Have fun." "Have fun. Have fun." "Have fun. Have fun." 'Kolkata. A place that has more unregistered people..' '..than registered population.' 'Everyone thinks that Kolkata is a lucky place.' 'That is why all the unlucky ones come running to Kolkata.' 'Like him. His name is Shubhojeet Mukherjee.' 'Shorter form of the name would be Shubho.' 'He has come to Kolkata around a month back.' 'He sings in a small bar.' 'But his dream is to be a great singer one day.' Yes.. - Run. Run. 'She is Shonali.' 'She is of the same kind.' 'She has come to Kolkata today to look for a job.' 'She thinks she will get a job as soon as she crosses the foot bridge.' Can't you watch where you are going? You just disembarked yourself on me like a monkey. Did I do that? Or was it you who fell on me like butterfly? Though you fell on me purpose, you are shouting at me? Did I fall on you? Why? Is your body a swimming pool? Look at yourself. Ugly as hell. Hey, get lost. You are no beauty either. Looking at you, it seems you travel by.. .. the local train at eight every morning. What do you mean by that? That is a train meant for maids. The ones who work at home take that train. Which trains do pick pockets take? The morning train at 6.13 am. The Duttapukur local. The same one. You take that local train everyday. Hey, will both of you leave .. .. or should I take you to the police station? Hey, get lost. If I had time, I would have shown you .. .. the timings of the train. Even I would have taught you a good lesson. Get lost. I have seen thousands like you. Get lost. Get lost.. - You get lost. My God! You have courage. You came to Kolkata without letting anyone know back home. Tell me, what would have happened to you.. ..had I not been staying here? Listen. I didn't have time to think about all that. If I would have stayed there for another day.. ..my parents would have got me married to the son of Deben Ghosh. Hey, they would have got you married, not hanged. So should the boy be Deben Ghosh's son? Thin like a stick. Do you know what we call him? He is the stick of his father's flag. He would fly off if you even blow air at him. So why did they fix your marriage with him all of a sudden? My father has taken a huge amount of loan.. ..from Deben Gosh for my mother's illness expenses and my education. Okay. - Since the time father passed away.. ..the man has been after my mother's life for money. He says that if she can't pay the money.. ..she has to get her daughter married to his son. He will make me a councilor. I got it. So when the principal and interest got added.. ..your life was put at stake. So what have you thought of doing now? I have to look for a job first. By paying off Deben Ghosh's interest.. ..I want freedom from him. Job? That is the only problem. I have enough savings to sustain for two to three months. Would you have a problem if I can stay here till I get a job? Look. I share my room here with someone. She has gone out. She will be back on Sunday. But you have to leave when she comes back. Please don't mind. I am getting late. I will leave. Take care. "Two people and two paths .. ..have gone off in different directions today." I have told you that I will take you to the dentist's clinic. You have given out such romantic smiles with those teeth. If you get rid of those, our love will be of no meaning. "Two people and two paths.." - Hey! Stop it. We are at a difficult crossroad of life. And you are singing? Listen. - I don't want to listen to anything. I see. So are you arguing with each other? Okay. I will sing a song now which will make madam say yes right away. I have said a yes to divorce a long time back. I will never give that to you. Hey. Hey madam. Please listen to the song before you leave. It is of Uttam and Suchitra. "This road shouldn't end.." - Hey! Hey! Sing that for your wife now. Swine! He is too much. - Hey! How many more such boring songs do you know? Are you a cigarette or an insect? Since the time you have joined.. ..all my tables have become empty. And today? All. All the tables are empty. You will see, sir. One day, I will become a big singer. That is my dream. I will not forget you even then. I will come here once a week and sing songs. For free. - Listen. That day better be a dry day. Now you may leave. Hey Haraipo. These days, you milk is too watery. Have you been mixing water? I swear on the tank. I never mix water in milk. If there is a pressure in the tap, I mix milk in water. Hey. Kumar Sanu? So early in the morning? Hey, sing a song for me on the guitar. Hey, mosquitoes have been biting me all night. And you want me to sing for you now? Why? Don't you have a mosquito repellant at home? I would put it if I had a house. I have lost my house. I have been sitting here since last night. Oh no, you should have informed me once at least. In desert, forest, water or any difficulty. Just remember me whenever you are in trouble. I have a house.. - What? But you will have to pay me a commission. A five hundred rupee note. I will give it. But where is it? I am telling you, I am telling you. Do you have a wife? Do I need a wife in case I need a house? That is the only hitch here. That thin man, Dhol Gobind, gives houses on rent. But he gives it only to married men. But where will I get a wife from? I am here. I will give you a good punch. Should I dress you up as my wife and take you? Hey, you are quite slow, aren't you? I will arrange for a wife. But you need to give me more commission for that. Okay. - Yes. Are you a milk man, commission man or a priest? Yes? MP3. - I see. Hey, hey, hey Haraipo. Where is sister number 2? In the bathroom. Okay. Go and get a bowl quickly. I took long today as I had a case to solve today. Haraipo. I wanted to meet you. Why? Is there a problem? This is my Shonali. She needs a house on rent. It shouldn't be too expensive. Do you know of a solution? Of course I do. It is inexpensive as well as good too. Are you married? - No. She has come here just yesterday. She doesn't know anyone. You know a lot of people. - Hey! Make some arrangement, Haraipo. Okay, okay. It will be a problem if you pamper me too much. I will need a commission. A five hundred rupee note. Okay. Thank you. 'And he is Rahul.' 'He has a dream that one day.. ..he will be a hugely successful businessman.' 'But where is the capital?' Oh no.. - What is the matter? You seem to be upset. What is the problem? Money. Whenever I ask my father to give me money.. ..to start a business, he seems like coming running.. .. to me with upheld horns. He is more like a demon than a father. Change him. Meaning? The meaning is quite simple. Impress a girl from a rich family. Then under the care of a new father, count money. What are you trying to say? Have you heard of Shona MLA? - Yes. His only daughter. Chandni. I am getting married to her. What? Wait, wait, wait. That means, one side you have Shona's daughter and on another.. Swine! You don't have the capacity to buy an inexpensive ring. And you are harboring dreams of marrying the daughter of Shona? If Shona comes to know of this.. ..he will bury you alive under the banana tree of his house. But if he comes to know that the son of.. ..Harshvardhan Banerjee is dating his daughter.. ..he would carry his daughter on his shoulder and get her to me. You have told Shona's daughter.. ..that you are Harshvardhan Banerjee's son? Yes, sir. I have taken all the information. Harvardhan has a bungalow in the South. No one except the caretaker stays there. Yes. If Shona comes to know of this, he will skin you alive. I don't know what he will do after that. Hey, dear, before he skins me alive.. ..I will marry his daughter. Wow. That is a brilliant plan. You can do whatever you want. But tell me, what should I do with my demon like father? I can't do anything at all. You have been cribbing for so long. Here you are. Take this. What? Hey, rupees fifty won't suffice to open a betel leaf shop. Hey, listen. Your son is feeling ashamed to take rupees fifty. Hey, my grandfather used to run his household.. .. expenses with rupees fifty. My father had come to Kolkata with rupees fifty. And I our wedding, your grandfather.. ..gave rupees fifty as a donation. Mother. Mother, can't you say something? Say something. What should I say? I had asked for simple diamond earrings. He hasn't given that to me till date. Go and check. Maybe the shop is closed forever. In the village, land worth 80 lakhs was sold. - What? I didn't see the money. I didn't even get to smell it. He has put fresheners in the wardrobe and kept it there. Shout. Shout more. Take a mike and let the whole state know about it. What? - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it? You have 80 lakhs. And you can't give me seven and half lakh rupees? No, I can't. I have spent a lot of money for your food, education.. .. maintenance and other things. I can't give you another penny. Father. Father. Look, if you don't give me the money, who will? Tell me. Steal. - What? - Commit robbery? Do whatever you feel like. And if you get caught, I am a lawyer. I will fight your case for free. Enough. Enough! Keep it low, keep it low.. - Hey, look, look. If you don't give me the money, I will leave the house and go. Dear.. - Bye. Really? I am leaving. Mother, I am leaving. You take care. Bye. Rahul. Rahul! Rahul, listen to me. Right, he will leave the house and go. Hey, I know your capacity. That was too much. What will you do after this? Tell me. I don't know. But I can't ask for money anymore. Why? By asking for money continually.. .. I have broken the records of all the beggars. He isn't giving it. He is asking me to steal, commit robbery. If I am caught, he will fight my case. That is a great suggestion. Hey, tell me, which father gives such a suggestion? Shut up. - Hey, yes. You commit a robbery. Look, I am telling you. There won't be any papers needed. Or guarantors needed. You only need the key for the place where the money is. 'Yes.' 'Not a bad idea.' What does he do? He plays the musical instrument and sings. Meaning? Is he a beggar? I have to live with a beggar? Why would he be a beggar? He is from a rich family. He just doesn't have a house. There he is. He is here. Sorry. I am a little late. The traffic jam was too much. You? You? Wow! That means you know each other? In that case, there is no problem at all. - Yes. I wouldn't stay with this lowly man. What do you think? I will stay with a lowly person like you? - Oh God. She is a woman from a low class. She doesn't have any class. Hey, did you call me a maid? Not just you. Your whole family is lowly. You.. Ria. Let us go from here. Shonali! Shonali, listen. Don't act childish. My roommate is coming in the evening. You have to stay somewhere in a house. Hey Sanu, Sanu. Listen to me. You need money to sleep here on a footpath too. And there are many cases on top of that. The rich boys have alcohol at night and drive recklessly. They will drive over you and crush you to death. Hey, she is in. And on this side, the husband is ready too. Here you are. Vermillion. I need fifty rupees for this. Make her wear this. - Hey. I don't want just anyone to make me wear the vermilion. Oh no. This is a huge problem. Now, come down. I will make you wear it. Get away.. - Hey. - Hey, forget it, forget it. A prince will come from England for her. To marry her. He is in for trouble. Hey, give it to me. Give it to me. "My lover is the dark Lord Krishna." "That is why I love you." - Gobind. Oh no, what is this? - Oh Gobind. - Yes. Gobind, save me, save me, save me. Save me. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.. - Or else I will die. Why? What happened to you? - Now.. Now I got hold of a thief red-handed with cash of fifteen thousand. Okay.. - Red-handed. - And then? You are aware that I am a diabetic. - Hail Lord. That means I have to pass urine frequently. - Hail Lord. So I just made him stand and had just started passing urine. Hail Lord. - At that moment, the thief started running. - Hail Lord. At that time, whether I should stop the thief or stop urinating.. ..was the question that created my confusion. The thief ran away somewhere. - Hail Lord. Brother. - Yes. - In today's market, you can't even trust a thief. No, no, you can't. On another side.. On another side, do you know .. .. what the big boss of the police station has said? What did he say? - He says that I have kept .. .. the rupees fifteen thousand and helped the thief to flee. Hail Lord. - You tell me, brother. Do I seem like that to you? No. You do take bribes from people for sure. But from a thief? Hail Lord. Hail Lord. Now if I can't keep rupees fifteen thousand.. ..on elder boss's table, then.. - Then? He says that I will lose my job. - Hail Lord. No, no, as long as I am alive.. ..would I allow that to happen? Yes? - I will give you the entire sum. But you have to give me rupees ten. Hey, why just ten? Why just ten? I will give you your entire sum back. Hail Lord. Hey, I will take that. But you have to give me rupees ten as interest. Rupees ten? - Hail Lord. So that is it? - Hail Lord. And apart from that, you have to keep something as a mortgage. I have got it, brother. I have got it. This is the will of the ten acres of my village land. "That is why I love you." I.. I have told you so many times not.. ..to come here when an outsider comes here. As soon as she saw there is an outsider here.. ..she came here dancing with a cup of tea. Go, go away from here. Go! Hail Lord. - Gobind. Hey Gobind. Fool! Hail Lord. What is it? Where? I have come with the party. They will stay here. How long have you been married? Just a few days back. Hey! Hail Lord. You told me that they got married six months back. Oh no. Hey Gobind. It is a case of love. The registry was done six months back. He put the vermilion a few days back. Any problem? Do you have a certificate? - Oh no. Are you giving the house on rent or buying a car? Tell me. Oh no.. - Does it give proper service? Are the papers correct? Hey, it is a simple fact. He is husband and she is wife. - Hey listen.. Give the key to them and give the commission to me. Okay? - You speak too much. Hail Lord. Have you brought the advance? Yes. I have got it. - Give it. Will it get doubled in your pocket? Here you are. - Yes, this is fine. Okay. You can go. She will show the room to you. Go. Go and show the room to them.. - Yes. 'An old couple was killed by a servant due to greed of money.' 'The servant has been arrested.' Did you see that? Look at this. I had told you many times to do the household chores yourself. And not to keep a servant for that. Wait and watch. Sleep peacefully at night. And get up in the morning in a beheaded state. Mother. Hey, you are here, dear? - Yes. Where else will he go if not here? Even the places of charity have become choosy.## What is it? As soon as you have gone broke.. ..you have come back home, right? But remember something. The rent of this house would be two meals a day. And not a penny apart from that. Father. I don't want anything from you. I have just come to take blessings and give sweets. I have started a new business. - Really? Yes. - What business? Electronic goods. We have everything. CD player. DVD player. T.V. And there are many other things. It is a huge showroom. Did it entail a lot of money? - Yes. I have put in 7.5 lakhs. And the rest of the fifty lakhs is a bank loan. 7.5 lakhs? Where did you get it from? Why? You showed me the way. What way did I show you? - Wow. Didn't you tell me to steal or commit robbery? I did it. What? - Yes. I had the information. Okay? There was a lot of money in the house. The couple used to stay alone. So what I did was to enter their room at night stealthily. Both of them were asleep. After that, I took out the key from under the bed very slowly. Then I went and opened the wardrobe. I took out the money .. .. and kept the key back where it was supposed to be kept. That means that they have informed the police by now. They don't know yet. But they will know. Whose house did you steal from? Do we know them? - Why? In our house? Hey, the amount of 80 lakhs that.. ..you had kept in the wardrobe after selling the land? I took it from there. Fool! You are trying to cheat your own father? When I asked you for the money in a very nice way.. ..you didn't give it. You asked me to steal and commit robbery then. I obey everything that you say. So how could I disregard you now? Tell me. And all the money in this house is black money. Rahul. My dear one. My naughty boy. My sweet son. You took your father's money by mistake. Now give the money back. I can't give it back anyone. It has entered the market. Final? - Final. So now you can finally leave the house and go. Get lost! Get lost! Who is it? I have heard that house is up for rent. Is that right? No. That is not right. Okay. Who are you? You have come to my house and asking me who I am. No, I mean, I have come to meet someone here. He works in this house. Madhusudan. Isn't he here? Why do you want to meet him? It is a matter regarding money. He can also earn something. Anyway, forget it. What can I do if he isn't here? Sir! Sir, sir, sir. Sir, I am Madhu. Madhusudan. You don't believe me. You don't right? Hey, look, look, here. Here I.. - No, no, no. Hey, look, look. Here you are. Here you are. Here you are. I see. So this is the real picture. Yes. - The earlier one was a trailer. Anyway, forget it, forget it. Let us go inside. We will go inside and talk. Come on. Come on. Come on, sir. Come on, come on. Since I got up in the morning.. ..my right palm has been itching. And why was it itching? The salary date isn't here yet. Yes, yes. So.. Do you want some? - No, thank you. My day starts with a drink. Yes. Wow. You didn't mix water or soda? - No. You had it neat? You know something, mister? Sir has got all this for his friends. But his friends only when he does. So just so that the expiry date doesn't set in.. ..I used to drink it in small quantities. And mix some water in it. And in this process, there is just water now. There is no alcohol. You are a unique man. I know that. Anyway, let us get down to business. Yes. Tell me. I wanted to say that you stay alone in this house, right? Yes, sir. Sir hasn't come to this house since years. And I take salary by doing nothing here. Okay, how would it be if you could earn .. .. some extra money with your salary, Madhusudan? It would be great. Yes. This is what I wanted to know. From tomorrow, Harshvardhan's son will stay in this house. Yes. What? Not the real son. A fake one. I am the one. You.. You? What are you saying? I am absolutely right, brother. Who is the boy? He is the son of industrialist Harshvardhan Banerjee. The owner of Shonali group of industries Harshvardhan Banerjee? Tell me the truth or else I will kill you. Yes. He has said that he will meet you. I knew it. You are Shona Rai MLA's daughter. You wouldn't date a low class boy. Wow. The relative of Harshvardhan Banerjee. Shona Rai MLA. People are with us. What is this? What else? I will sleep here. What do you mean? I pay half of the rent. Does the rest fall from above? Hey! Okay. There will be a lottery. I will write down our names of two chits of paper. The one whose name comes out will sleep on the bed. Go. Go and write it down. No, no. That won't happen. I will choose it. Choose it. Shonali. Go. Shubho. Get up quickly. What? What.. What happened? What do you mean by what happened? Can't you sleep quietly? You are snoring like a bull. I feel cold when I sleep on the floor and I start snoring. Is this known as snoring? It seems as if a machine is on. Can one sleep like this? - Then go and sleep on the terrace. If I sleep on the floor, I will snore. That is it.. - Go, go, sleep on the bed. I don't need the bed. I want to sleep peacefully. Go. Thank you, thank you. Hey.. Fool! Lord. Madhu. Shona. Shona(gold)! No, no, not gold. This could be bronze. Nothing is original in this house. Everything is fake. Hey, I am not talking about that gold. - Then? Shona MLA. Chandni's father. Yes, you do something. Go and open the door. And I hope you remember everything that I have told you. - Yes. You won't get a penny if you make a mistake. What mistake? I will say everything that you have taught me. Hold this, hold this, yes. It is me. Shona MLA. Okay, Harshvardhan.. Don't call me again and again. You know I am not interested in your nonsense thing. You know that I don't like listening to the same thing.. ..over and over again. It is in my office drawer. Take it from there. And what about my car? BMW? No, no, it is too common. Everyone uses it these days. I want Rolls Royce. Three of them. One would be for me. One for my father. And the third one would be a gift for my future father-in-law. Yes? - I am Shona.. No, I don't want gold or anything. There is a lot of gold in this house anyway. Just the other day, in the wedding of Madhusudan's sister.. ..I gave 100 kilograms. 150 kilograms. - What? You gave a chain that weighed 50 kilos to the son-in-law later. Oh yes, yes, yes.. - He is very forgetful. I don't remember.. - Yes. Anyway, you can leave. No, I am.. I am Shona MLA, Chandni's father. Father-in-law.. Father, you? - Yes, yes. - He understood. - Yes, yes. Why did you take the trouble of coming all the way? You could have told me. I would have come. Yes.. - No, that is not a big deal. It is our habit to go to people's houses. That is why people are with us. Chandni has told me everything. I have been just thinking about the gate of this house. Supriyo weds Chandni. Okay, so when is the final date? Meaning I want to settle it as soon as possible. Wedding, engagement and reception. All the ceremonies will be on the same day. Okay? - No, father. A wedding should always be systematic. I mean, engagement, wedding and reception. On different days. Why? Do you have an objection? No. Actually father wants me to get married into the.. ..families of the Tatas or Ambani. But I have told him very clearly. I want to marry the girl of my own choice. And that is Chandni. Younger sir is a man of his word. Wow.. - Once the wedding is over.. ..I will convince father. And what if you don't? - What? So what if he doesn't get convinced? Younger sir has a bank full of money. Really? - Yes. In that case, there is no problem. - No. Sure thing. In that case, can I decide on the first ceremony? - Yes? Yes. - For sure. People are with us. Sure. Come on, father. I will see you off. Father! - Yes. Without sir's knowledge, sir has a son. And at this age? Explain the rice accounts to Narayan. - Okay madam. Hey listen. - Hey. Such an amazing voice! Such an amazing voice! Wow! You have never ever told me that I have a beautiful voice. Have fun. You are getting confused. I didn't talk about you. I am talking about Ustad Amir Khan. You are too much. Hold this. The lawyer is here. Get up. For you, is the lawyer more important than Ustad Amir Khan? I have been extending my business all through.. ..the nation on your name. Can't you extend your brain? Do you have any grey cells left.. ..or have you put everything in God's veneration? That is it. That is it. Enough of music. They have to take the train. They are in a hurry. Oh no, what should I do with you? Tell me. You have brains under your knees.. ..and there is nothing under the skull. Why did you take the trouble, sister-in-law? It is not a bother. You are our friends first. And then AIDS virus. AIDS virus? Advisor. Legal advisor. It is the same thing. Have fun. Everything is same? I can see that you can't differentiate between anything now. Yes, yes. I was listening to Amir Khan just sometime back. I am sure you know Amir Khan, right? Hey, who doesn't know him? I am crazy about him. Here you are. This is known as an appreciator of talent. He knows how to appreciate talent. And you? You perform different forms of veneration on different days. There is a new saint in vogue these days. She is an ardent follower of his these days. - Shut up. Sister-in-law is not at fault here, brother. The fault is entirely yours. You have never taken her to the city. One can learn a lot even by staying in the village. The villages are the roots of the country. And I am a man of roots. Then why did you send your son abroad for education? I was born in this village and have grown up here. And I will finish my life here. Their matter is different. They have to keep up with time. God forbid but you should not be in Haranath's condition. Why? What happened? Just like you, even Haranath sent his son to London for studies. What happened? The son became modern and acquired a high.. ..standard of living. And his wife and Haranath remained the same. Rustic. He is even ashamed to take his parents in front of his friends. Forget about staying with them.. ..he doesn't even address them as his parents. Then one day, he left by calling them rustic. After that, he has never met them. Till the day he died, the gentleman.. ..kept waiting for his son like a watch bird. Oh Lord. We will die if Bubub acts like this with us. I have told him many times that we must go to the city once.. ..and learn the mannerisms of the city life. But he doesn't listen to me. Hey listen. Let us go to the city once. Okay. Just for a month. Don't pester me. Let me think it over. I have seen the pitiable state of Haranath on my own. - Yes. I am thinking. I am thinking. You can do your job. Yes. Yes. Just have a look at all the files. And the file of Shonali Chemicals will be delivered next week. That is your job. You will understand it better. In that case, I will take your leave today. - Yes. Okay. I had a request, sir. I mean, if Amir Khan comes to your house someday.. ..please inform us. Then we can click a photo with him. He died a long time back. He died? - Yes. What are you saying, brother? Just a few days back, we watched his movie 'Three Idiots'. Three Idiots? I am talking about Ustad Amir Khan. Have you heard of him ever? Ustad Amir Khan? - Hey, come on, we are late for the train. I am leaving. - Yes. We are leaving.. - Come on, come on, come on. All three of you are alike. Three idiots. Yes.. - Wow. People are with us. In that case, the first ceremony is over. After ten days, the second ceremony. The wedding. Yes. What do you say, priest? - Yes? Yes, I mean.. - The priest has said.. ..that the second ceremony will take place after ten days. Yes.. - Great. Great.. - Superb. What is so funny? It is my baked bread. I can make it the way I want to. Do I need to take your permission to laugh? There is a mad house for laughing. Go there. And there is a dustbin for burnt baked bread. Go and throw it there. Wow. This smells so good. It is not burnt at all. I will eat to my heart's content. "If destiny makes us meet.." Where are you? Is anyone home? So? Hail Lord. How is everything? How is everything going on? Hey. Hail Lord. I can sense a nice fragrance. Of baked bread. Yes, yes. - Yes. Now look at this. I got it. Hail Lord. After marriage, even my wife.. - Yes. Used to make nice baked bread. - Yes. Now what should I tell you? When my mother-in-law had that baked bread.. ..she passed away. - I see. Hail Lord, since then, we have not made baked bread at home. My wife makes very nice baked bread. - Is that so? There she is. Will you have baked bread? What? - No, no, no, no. No, no. There wouldn't be enough for you. - Hey, no. Why wouldn't it be enough for me? - No, no, Hail Lord. In any case, post marriage, hunger pangs are more in number. And apart from that, what will daughter-in-law think? Hey, no, no, she won't mind at all. She loves feeding people. - Really? - Yes. Hail Lord. Is he right? He is absolutely right. Did you see that? - Yes. Go. Give baked bread to uncle. Listen, Shubho. Let me tell you a secret. Bengalis are the biggest food lovers. - Too much. Hail Lord. Here you are. - Yes. Very good. - What is this? You have given him only two baked breads. Hey, can two suffice for such a big man? No.. - It will be equal to a mere morsel. Wait. I will get more. Now, look, Hail Lord. - What? He loves feeding people. Here you are. Here you are. Take all of them. Okay? What? All of them? Wow, wow, wow, good, good. Is there a gravy dish.. - Yes, she has made it too. I will just get that too. - I see. So you have made it? - Yes. Really. White potatoes in the evening. Here you are. Take the whole bowl. You can give it later. Okay? Okay, okay, okay. Tell me. Is there chutney with this? No, no, that hasn't been made. I see. - That hasn't been made. This would have been a complete dish if this had chutney. Hail Lord. That doesn't matter anyway. Hail Lord. We can have it later. - Yes. - Yes. Yes. - Should I leave now? Okay. - Yes. "Hot and soft. Soft and hot." Who eats the food destined for him? Only burnt baked bread remains with you. Don't be too happy for defeating me once. Hey! There you are. You are here? I was looking for you all over. Hey, you will get the money. Let the wedding happen. - Wedding? That won't happen. Instead of wedding chants.. ..you will listen to chants of a mourning ceremony. Are you high early in the morning? I am just a little high. But he will come here and send you to highest level. What rubbish are you talking about early in the morning? Who is going to come? Your father. Harshvardhan Banerjee. He is coming here with madam. What should I do now? Go into hiding. You shouldn't be seen anywhere around the house. I will lose everything. But it will return. - What? Yes. I know sir. He wouldn't be able to stay here for more than seven days. You can hide somewhere else for those few days. You have increased my expenses. In order to stay in style, I am neck deep in debt. You got a ring for the engagement ceremony, right? - Yes. Keep that as mortgage and arrange for money. For one week, go and stay in an inexpensive lodge. I will inform you when sir leaves. Okay? - Okay. Lord. Please help me to tide over for this time. Yes, son-in-law. Tell me. You are going to London? For one week? I see. Business trip? That will bring money. Go, go, go. They are here. Hey, hey, don't touch. Don't touch. Yes. Yes, come. Come. Yes. How are you, Madhusudan? My heart was crying out for you, sir. From now on, ask your heart to laugh a lot. - Yes. No, that is fine. I am feeling very nice. - Yes. Sir, he is our manager for Shonali Pharmaceuticals. Shujoy Chatterjee. - Yes. You have come for the first time. That is why we have arranged for a welcome ceremony. What was the need to do all this? So shall we leave now, sir? Hey, where will you go now? I haven't even been introduced with all of you yet. Come on, come on, come on.. - Yes. Come on.. - Yes, let us go in. Hey Madhu. - Come in. Where are you going empty-handed? Take out sir's suitcases and luggage. Suitcase and luggage? What do you mean by that? It must be barely one piece of luggage. Sir will stay for only one or two days. Yes. - Who told you that? - Yes. I know. No. You have wrong information. - What? Sir will stay here from now on. - I see. Madhu. Madhu. Hey Madhusudan. Yes? - What happened to you? Nothing. Take it out. Lord. Why did you have to choose me of all people.. ..to take away sources of income from? You did so much to drive me away from sleeping on the bed. Now sleep peacefully on the wet bed. I will sleep on a dry space peacefully. That is why they say. God is above us. Oh no. - What? "Secretly and sly on a sudden touch." "In the rough breeze, when I found you." "Come on. Please tell me." "In the beautiful sunlight, in the imaginary vision." "Let us go to the clouds. In scenes of happiness." "Come on. Please come on." "Why doesn't my heart listen to me?" "Why doesn't my heart agree with limitations?" "Why doesn't my heart listen to me?" "I don't know." "Secretly and sly on a sudden touch." "In the rough breeze, when I found you." "Come on. Please tell me." "In the beautiful sunlight, in the imaginary vision." "Let us go to the clouds. In scenes of happiness." "Come on. Please come on." "It gets lost. It leaves behind everything." "It spreads colors in the blue color of the sky." "It gets lost. It leaves behind everything." "It spreads colors in the blue color of the sky." "In the morning dream drenched in colors." "In the morning slumber kept carefully." "For you. I look for you." "In the morning dream drenched in colors." "In the morning slumber kept carefully." "For you. I look for you."

I am trying to fill in the gaps in the rhythm. Fill in the gaps? - Yes. If the rhythm maestro would have seen you.. ..he would have skinned you alive. Hey listen. A musical note is mother and rhythm is the father. The ones who don't have a sense of rhythm are orphans. Go and check who has come. There is no one at home. Hey.. - No, no. I have got into a habit of saying that. No. I am coming. Whom do you want to meet? Hi. Who are you? You are too much. It is me. It is me. Me. Who are you? Harshvardhan Banerjee. He is my boss. Hey, who is she? - Madam. I am Mrs. Banerjee. I see. So you haven't changed the surname? - No. Do you know something, brother? I have made sister-in-law the mayor of White Forest. You have made her a forest mayor? No, no. It is a club. Social club. - Yes. I have to do everything that women here do, right? Women here don't just cook here all day. They do a lot of social work too. And do you know the strangest part? When I went there, I saw that everyone already knew sister-in-law. I am so unfortunate. I am the only one who didn't know her. And since the time we have gone, I swear that.. ..everyone has been coming to sister-in-law and hugging her. And they are welcoming her as Mrs. Banerjee. - Yes. Everyone at the club told me. Wall come, Mrs. Banerjee. Wall come, Mrs. Banerjee. And you know the best part? He recognized me and shook hands with me. Who? Who dared to touch my wife's hands? Khan. - Khan. Khan? Shah Rukh Khan. A lot of film stars come there. Really? - Yes. Khan? I will thrash you so hard that you will fall flat on your face. Madam. Even if you feed a lot of grass to the bullock.. ..he won't give milk. Hey Madhu. - Yes? How much would you take to retire early? Just.. It came out of my mouth al of a sudden, sir. Please swallow it. There will be another dialogue here. Even if you wash a crow in a washing machine.. ..it wouldn't turn into a swan. Keep quiet. I am going to freshen up. I have to go to dance class. Dance class? Hey, if at this age you move around too much.. ..the waist will get dislocated. - Curse you! Madhu. - Sir. What is the difference between a war and marriage? What is the difference? In a war, the enemy's camp is different. And in a marriage, you have to live with the enemy in the same house. Wow! Thank you, thank you. "Come to me, lover.." "I am Jane and I like to ride and elephant." "Tarzan is young.." - Hey, what happened to you? Have you had a fit or is there a cockroach inside your clothes? "Come baby, come." Hey, what are you doing? - What has happened to you? Oh no. I am practicing dance. Can't you see that? - Hey! Please don't be naughty at this age, dear. I will have to incur expenses if something happens to you. Hey, nothing will happen to me. - I am not talking about you. I am talking about the tiles of the floor. Hey, now we people of Kolkata. Shouldn't we live in style? The officers of your office are so stylish. And you? You wear age old clothes like shirt and loin cloth and roam around. I am a pure Bengali. There wouldn't be an argument about that. Listen. For many years, I have stayed in the village.. ..and performed venerations. Now I will do something different. Yes. I can see that. You have got up on a useless horse. Now you will twist like a rotating top. - What? Then you will fall flat on your face. After that, your false teeth wouldn't be found. - You are too much. I have false teeth? Look at your own teeth. Oh no. I can't find a job anywhere. Hey, isn't Harshvardhan Banerjee from your native place? Who is Harshvardhan Banerjee? The owner of Shonali group of industries. - Yes. So? He is in Kolkata at the moment. Hey, you should meet him once. Your name and the name of his establishment is the same. Maybe he will get impressed and give you a job. Thrice. This has happened thrice. This is a bad electronic piece. The old one was good. Why did you buy a new one? Hey, sometimes old things have to be thrown away.. ..and new things should be brought in. New things denote new affections. - I see. So just because I have become old.. ..you might change me one day too. I might have to do it if needed. - Forget it. On seeing me, no one believes me that.. ..I have a son of marriageable age. Everyone thinks I am in college. I am sure they have cataract in their eyes. - What? Thank God people haven't seen us together. Or else they would have thought that.. ..mother is getting her son for tuitions. You are acting smart? Get someone new. She will be like your CD player. While working, it will go.. Hello. E Zone. - Very bad. Who is it - Harshvardhan Banerjee. Oh yes, sir, tell me. You have sent a malnourished child. It is reeling of cough and its voice is stuck due to phlegm. Sir, I think you have made a small mistake. You should contact a child specialist. This is an electronic showroom. Have fun. Okay, tell me, do you have your brain.. ..under your knees and is your skull empty? I am talking about the CD player that you have sent to me. I see, yes, yes. Sorry, sir. Do something. Take this back. And send me a nice CD player with good sound quality. Don't worry at all, sir. I will go and check it. Okay? Who are you? - Shonali. Yes. Shonali. What is the matter? - I have come to meet Harshvardhan. Why? What is the reason? For a job? - No, no, he doesn't need a job. I have a very big business. No, no, I haven't come for his job. I need a job. - I see. You can have a look at my certificates. I have seen what I wanted to see. You can come later. He is busy. Look, I.. - I told you. Go. 'Let me wait since I have already come here.' 'Just in case, I can meet Harshvardhan.' Hello. 'I think this is Harshvardhan's daughter.' How sweet! Hi. Excuse me. Hello. Please tell me, where is the CD player? What? - CD player. I have come to repair it. Oh no. I am not a mechanic. I am the owner. Actually I visit big customers on my own. Go inside and check. - Okay. Thank you. I should come here at times. Good, good. This side. Come this side. Sir. Rahul from E Zone. Please. That side. That side. Here it is. The dead body is here. Lug it on your shoulder and take it away. I will check it, sir. - There is nothing to check. It is beyond repair. - Sir, two minutes. Hey, no, no. The compilations of big musicians are lying there. Sir, I think it is a minor problem. Shall I tell you something? - Yes. Put it on your shoulder. And praise the Lord and take it away. Okay, sir, I will do something. I will send a man and get this replaced. Okay? Thank you, sir. See you. I said, see you. No, no, he can give me a bad piece again. I don't want replacement. I want my money.. I want my money back. Hey fool, where will you go? I am sure.. Greetings. Greetings. Who are you? - I had come to meet you. Madam said you are busy. So.. - Fool! That is a lie. That is a lie. I am always free. So what brings you here? Actually I really need a job. I have brought all my certificates. Where? Let me see, let me see, let me see. Oh my God. You are MA. Wow. You have a degree in music as well. So.. What else have you done? I haven't done anything else. I was just joking. Show me your palm. - What? Show me your palm. So what kind of a job are you looking for? It can be anything. Now.. The post of the watchman of our gate is empty. No MA, BA or degree of music is needed for that. Will you do it? There you are. There you are. Now look here. I joked again. Show me your palm again. - What? Show me your palm. Show me your palm again. - Again? I really like this. Here you are. Here, here.. - Hey! Haven't you left yet? Go. Go.. - I was talking to her.. - Go. Sir was saying that.. - Your sir says that when he sees a girl. Go. Go. Go! Go! What is it? You asked such a sweet girl to leave? Sweet girl? If you like her so much.. ..you should open a company on her name. Hey, if you wouldn't have been there.. ..I would have opened a company on her name. I wouldn't have even asked you. - Yes. I know you very well. Even I am a girl from the Bhattacharya family. My father sent a lot of dowry during our wedding. He had fed 1500 of the members from the groom's side. I will take every bit back. Yes. Too much! What is she? Is she a wife or a sea tide? She erupts wherever she feels like. This will go to Ashok Nagar. This will go there. You can write down the address. Okay? - Excuse me. Yes. Hi. - Hi. Hey, why did you take the trouble of coming here? I had told your father that I will deliver the CD player home. I have come here for a job. You had given an ad in the paper. Sorry. I mean, I didn't get this. I need a job desperately. You will work here? What are you saying? - Look. I really need this job. Why does Harshvardhan Banerjee's daughter need a job? You are definitely mistaken. You.. - I got it. I got it. I am an individual. I want to create self identity. Isn't it? Very good. I like that. I appreciate that. Thank you. - Sit down. 'I will lose the job if I tell him the truth.' Excuse me. Okay. What is your name? Shonali. Shonali? Wow. Wow. Your father, as I can see, has named all his companies after you. Shonali textiles. Shonali pharmaceuticals. Shonali Chemicals. Wow. It is a beautiful name. - Thank you, sir. Oh no. Don't call me sir. Rahul. Henceforth you can call me Rahul. Our relationship will be of friends from today. - Okay, sir. Hey. Rahul. I see. Rahul. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Rahul. So sweet. "There are parrots of different kinds." "They want to.." - Yes. Water the plants nicely. It seems they haven't bathed for three years. - Yes. Come puppy, come. Hey, have you seen this? My new puppy. Yes. So where are you going with the great personality? You are too much! Have you gone blind? Can't you see that it is a dog? Hey, I am asking the dog.. ..where it is going with the great personality. Hey, you keep quiet. Disgusting! Remember this. I am your wife. Curse you. Come puppy. Laugh. Laugh. Laugh with your entire jaw out. There aren't 32 teeth. 30. Two of them have fallen off. Yes, yes, who is it? Hey, it is me, it is me. Shona MLA. - I see. Shona.. You.. You are here? Why? Isn't son-in-law back yet? He is in the lodge. No! He is in London. Come back after a week. Go away. I see. In that case, I will go and meet Harshvardhan once. Yes. That would be good.. Hey, hey, Sir.. Sir is not at home. Where has he gone? - He has gone to the market. No, no.. Temple. To the temple. In order to perform a special veneration. Why is he performing a special veneration? So that younger sir can get married to a nice girl. Okay, I will wait in that case. - Yes.. That would be pointless. - Why is it pointless? After the veneration, sir will go to the Ganges for a bath. At Falta. Why Falta? There was water even at Babughat. There was a wish asked for at Falta's water. - I see. Really? Okay. In that case, I will come tomorrow. Will you really come? Hey, I will come. I will come. Why are you crying? Do you know the reason? Out of happiness. Due to the happiness that younger sir will.. ..be the son-in-law of a man like you. People are with us. But I don't have anyone by my side. Madhu. Run away. If you are alive, you can earn. If you stay here, your mourning ceremony will be.. ..celebrated after thirteen days. Mourning ceremony? Yes, sir. Sir, I am in deep trouble. Why? Did a big ant bite you? No. Father. - Yes. Father has passed away. A man from the village just came by and informed me. Sir, you can give me around 6000. You can deduct that from the income. Yes. I am arranging for the money.

The engagement has already taken place. The rings have been exchanged. Oh God. What is this? Hey. My Bubun. He can't be my son. He isn't here. - I know that. He is in London. - Yes. Yes. But he had come here. When did he go? After the first ceremony. I mean, after the engagement. Why? To earn money. Business trip. Have fun. Listen. I have sent my son to London to study. Not to earn money. Okay, fine, fine, fine. Whatever had to happen has already happened. What is the point of losing your mind now? Please see to it that the next two ceremonies are in place. No. I won't see to it. My son will get married in the family.. ..in which I want him to get married. So what about whatever that has happened till now? What has happened? He has made her wear the ring. - Yes. The wedding hasn't taken place, right? I will open the ring from the finger. The wedding has been called off. That is the final decision. Hey! Shona's daughter is not an ordinary girl.. ..that anyone can cheat her. Hey! Don't shout too much. Looking at you, one can sense how your daughter would be. Yes. I think she has a moustache like her father. - Yes. Hey Harshvardhan Banerjee. If you have money, it is in your pocket. You don't know Shona MLA. I belong to a political family. My father was a very influential man. I think his father used to perform venerations in people's houses. Yes. - And he used to accompany him. I am talking about bigger things like bomb. Bomb. Bomb? Keep it in the sun to make it dry. You can leave. Okay. I am leaving. But I will come again. I have a habit of going to people's houses frequently. - Hey.. One minute. - Yes, tell me. Instead of going to someone's house frequently.. ..don't you think it is better to do their job in the first visit? Shall I tell you something? - Yes, tell me. I didn't say that to you. I am talking to my wife. Do you think we should call Bubun once? I think.. - You should call him. I will assess the situation on my own. People are with us. - Go, go. Trying to scare us?

You will come on a horse one day, marry me and take me away. To a far off land. - Hey. Hey! Here you are. There is a letter for you. I saw you husband and thought that I will give it to him. That is why I asked him to wait. - Yes. I know that. Fool. Behave as you feel like. Why should I bother? I don't have to stay here. Deben Ghosh's son is coming for lunch.

He was in the scene since the beginning. We have to take care of the boy. We have to do something, okay. - What? We have to threaten and scare this boy.. ..and send him back. Have you thought of something? Oh no. God! Cow dung. Is the boy washing his feet? Hey, I don't know if it his foot or the wire. But as soon as he comes forward, we have to catch hold of him. Okay?

You will be murdered when you come here.. ..and on the other side, Shonali will get married to Shakti. No. I won't be able to live without Shonali. Hey mad man. If you lose your wife, you can get another one. But if you lose life, you won't get another one. Yes. That is right. - Hey you! Hey Shakti is here! Shakti is here! What should I do now? - Is there someone called Langcha around? Yes? Is there someone called Langcha around? No. There is no one called Langcha here. Hey, that man is hiding somewhere here. If I can see him around, I will kill him. I had sent men. Since there were people around.. ..they wounded him and left him. He is my case number 50. If I can kill him, I will throw a golden jubilee party. A golden jubilee party. Yes. - Fine. Fine. Greetings, Shakti. - Okay. Tell him. Yes. - I will find him for sure. Fool! Did you see him?

Tell him that father has come to know. And then when you get the job, you can tell him. But what if he goes to Harshvardhan's house to enquire? So what? Forget it. He will come to know one day for sure. "It is my first love. It has happened for the first time." Sir. I have checked everything. It is in perfect condition. Okay, since the time I have got this new system.. ..have I told called you even once? Or have I told you that there is some problem.. ..and you should come here and check it once?

If you try to come closer to this house or family.. ..I will turn your entire family into a family of invalids. Sir. Sir, I feel this boy wouldn't move out easily from the way. I am in such a huge problem. We came here as a couple but.. ..I will have to go back alone. Sir, I feel there is no way other than hooliganism. What are you saying? Should I fight with a young boy over my own wife? Will that look nice? - No, no, sir. Why would you do that? Leave all that to me. Sir, I am a lawyer dealing in criminal cases. I know a lot of goons. You just have to pay some amount of money. And give us a brief on that fool. That is it. Don't hurt him too much, okay? You can just hurt him a little and that will be enough. I see. But if he acts too smart.. ..I will cut off his breathing tube.. ..and make a soup of that and deliver it at your place. Hey, I don't want all that. I don't want anything of that sort.

E Zone. - Rahul? Shonali. - Shonali? Shonali, where are you? I want to meet you right now. No, no, I can't meet right now. Actually I have come for shopping with father. I have called you secretly without letting father know. For how long will these furtive conversations go on, Shonali? You have called me after five days. Do you know the state of my heart? I am so worried. If you wouldn't have called me today.. ..I would have gone to your house. Hey, please don't do all that. Please. I will be in a problem if father comes to know. What do you mean? He knows already. He sent goons to thrash me. Oh God. - Okay, you tell me. If I have to call you regarding office work.. ..what should I do? I will call up at your place. Rahul.

Okay, okay, okay.. ..I am sure your rustic father is standing nearby. What? Yes, yes. Okay. Okay, it is fine, Shonali. You don't have to speak. Okay? If your answer is yes, you will hang up. Rahul. I.. - What is this? You are calling up from this phone again? And you are a patient, right? Go. Go to the bed. Hello? Shonali? Yes! "My heart says it loves you." "My heart says it loves you." "My heart says it loves you." "My heart says it loves you." "My heart is beating." "My mind is flying all around." "The relationship of love is about to start." "I think of it all the time."

So let me tell you that my CD player and fridge is working properly. You may leave now. Sir, I am requesting you for the last time. With your blessings, please get Shonali married to me. How can that be possible? - Why not? Can't a boy be in love with a girl? Now I know. Not with Shonali, you are in love with Shonali's money. So how much do you want to leave Shonali? Don't try to buy my love with money, Harshvardhan Banerjee. Keep quiet, fool. Love? But let me tell you something. She will not leave me and go with a shopkeeper like you. - Really? Yes. - Yes? So if you trust her so much, call Shonali. Let her come here and say it in front of me once. She has said what she wanted to say. You can leave. Or else I will call the police. Hey, why police? You can call the military. But remember, no strength in the world can keep Shonali and me apart. I know that you have kept her locked in the room upstairs. How did you know that? What else can you do? Yes? Get Shonali out till I am calm enough. Or else I will go upstairs and break the lock. Before that, you have to kill me. 24 hours. If I don't take Shonali within 24 hours.. ..my name wouldn't be Rahul from E Zone. Hey, get lost. Get a new name. Fool! He is in love with an elephant. This bill is huge.

It seems that your affection towards your wife has grown. No, no, you are mistaken. Come on, come outside. Come out. Come. Listen. I still have that letter with me. If the colony boys see that letter.. ..they will thrash you hard. - No, no, don't do that. I love you. But I am scared. If Gobindo comes to know.. ..he will kick me and send me to jail. He won't come to know. - What? I have planned everything. - I see. Okay. After some days, you and I will run off to a far off land. Where? Somewhere very far away. Dhol Gobindo wouldn't be able to find us. But.. - Why are you so scared? No, no. No, no, no. You will have to hide in an inexpensive lodge for some days. But where will I find such a lodge? Lodge.. There is a lodge called Goder Math near Sialda station. You have to stay there under a false name. And you have to act like a mad man. And I will send police officer Balaram Ghosh to you. He will get you to me from there to the station. And then you and I together will.. - Hey, where are you? Are you there or have you left? - Oh no. - Hail Lord. Who is it? You? Hey, keep your legs down? Yes. - Why have you come here? In the process of looking for you, I have lost all my money. And you are staying in this lodge under a false name. I am in such a bad state. I was knocking so hard on the door.. ..that even the bugs on the door were biting me. Now I will bite you. What did you tell me? The owner will stay there for a week and go away. Now he isn't ready to budge from there. Should I go and die on the streets? I am in a deep trouble. If I would have stayed there for another day.. ..I would have been crushed to death between sir and Shona. No, no. There is no point staying here anymore. Oh no. Even this is of no use. A decision has to be taken. The decision has been taken. Shona has taken it. The decorations will be done. But instead of reception, it will be your mourning ceremony. What? - His gang of goons is looking for you. If they find you.. - They will behead me first and.. ..then perform the mourning ceremony, right? I know that. I will do something. I am writing a letter. Please deliver it to Chandni somehow. But see to it that he father doesn't come to know. Give me two hundred rupees with that. Forget her father, even her grandfather wouldn't come to know. What? - Yes. I know that you have kept him hidden somewhere. You are an absolute fool. How many times do I need to tell you? I don't have any more sons. And I can't even have anymore. Harvardhan Banerjee. Don't play with the population. Tell me. Where is your son? - You don't believe me. We never believed dishonest people. Never? - Never. Sure? - Sure. In that case, listen to me. The boy you are talking about is my son indeed. And it is also true that my son had said that.. ..he will marry your daughter. - Yes. But as a relative.. - Yes. I do not like you at all. That is why I have asked my son to hide. And I won't tell you about his hiding place. Fool. Do whatever you feel like. - Really? Even I will show you what Shona MLA is like. I will find your son. I will get him married to my daughter. I will send my daughter and son-in-law for their honeymoon. And then make both of you leave Kolkata by a local train. People are with us. They will support us. Look at his condition. - Shut up. He is trying to sell local train tickets. Have fun. "Hey, my lover.." Hey, fool, is there a man hiding here? Hey fool. Can't you speak up? Hey fool. I will shoot you from behind. Listen. Tell me whatever you need to say. - Who is it? Hey, who are you?
