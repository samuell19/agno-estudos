Oh my god! l'm seeing $ 100 for the first time, since last 1 1/2 months. See, the fare for Broadway from here is $ 20. Whatever is left is yours... only when you'll allow me to drive! When papa is in a rush, he trust only one person's driving... Only himself!! For this, no matter he has to give $ 1 00 instead of $ 20! Do you have License? - Hop in there! But, drive carefully! l'm the only cabbie here, who hasn't got any ticket yet! Get it. - Got it! Oolumbia University, 1 1 6th Street, Broadway.

For that reason, l'm driving this taxi. Even now, when a dream is shattered in New York... A new taxi driver is born. Most of the driver you see here... some are doctor, lT whizkid, or some Hollywood star. Everybody saw a big dream! When it was broken, everybody became taxi driver. But, my man. You wait & see, if everything goes right, Harry will never drive a taxi. Ask why? What else you'll do, Harry? Actually, our teams winning racer ran with my 1 3th girl friend. Therefore, there was some tension. Actually, just kidding! There wasn't 13th, as it's unlucky. Therefore, l jumped from 1 2th to 1 4th. But, now Speeding Saddles will be back to number 1 ! That's great! You've found some new driver or what? What a jokes! R.V. How would be R.V.? l don't know? l've never seen him. ls he good? - ls he good! My brother from another mother! He is mind blowing! This is the way, Mom & Papa met each other. Not exactly, love at fiirst sight situation. But, this is New York. Here, love at first sight never happens. Mom was learning music in New York. Mom is the best best best piano player in the world! Papa teases her by calling Atty-Fatty. They could not ever become a couple. But believe me, they did. Ohamp & myself, are the proof. Aunty Sasha, mom's best friend, class mate & house mate. All rolled into one. Speed up! - Oh, l'm already walking. l can't fly... Don't know? Once you get up from the piano, you are in a slow motion. Damn, my i-pod! Yeah, damn your i-pod! l threw it so many times in the dust bin & you take it out each time. lt's like so uncool. l've taken itjust 6 months ago. Why should l throw it? Then, why are you fighting with it? Why isn't it stopping? l bumped with a fool. He only felled it. Like ugly bozo or good looking bozo? Bozo like... nice bozo! But, he broke my i-pod.

My 7th girl friend always use to tell... lt's not 7th but 8th. ln fact, 7th could not even speak. My 8th girl friend use to tell that... East or West never rest until you find the best! And the best, he is! Best... He's best to drive only a taxi. lndians are best only at that! Fact is a fact... Then, let's see who is fact & who is defect. Oan we have a race, between R.V. & Danny? The one who is the winner, is our racer. My 4th girl friend always use to tell me... All right... all right. Let them race. Fantastics! Warming up! - Wasting time. Oome on, Danny. Harry... . Billy. Don't he know to apply brakes? Awesome... Awesome... Awesome Where were you in my life, till now? No problem, you've come now. Everything is going to be awesome, now.

You keep this. $ 5000 Oash, for 3 races. lf your performance is better than you'll have contract with Speed Saddles. $ 5000!! - Yes, it's a bit less but we'll increase it afterwards... What l'll do with so much money? My 1 0th girl friend slapped me here. Speak a bit louder. What l'll do with so much money? Okay, got it! Got it! At least you keep some. This is yours. Remember l'm the team manager. As is after watching your speed Billy have started taking care of my money as well. Are you sure? Why are you exhibiting it? Keep it inside. And always count it before taking cash.. Now, how could l count before taking the cash? You have to learn. You have a lot to learn. Now, take $ 1 000 from it & come tomorrow to Fast Track store at 8'o clock. Not in the morning, is it? - Then at night or what? We need to buy racing gear & after that a hair cut. What's wrong with my hair? You want to be a model or race driver? Now, you need to rehearse. 1 1 'o clock sharp. Practice! Early to bed & early to rise! Don't tell me, your 8th girl friend.

Let him order the wine. lf l'll not order, then he'll start lecturing on wine. l was supposed to carry on with this crazy fellow.. What did l know that he'll be this way?

You are fired! - Don't kid me.. l'm not kidding! You are terminated form the team!! How could they remove me this way? Billy said that he gave you chance for 10 races. BYou should have come 2nd or 3rd but last in every race. l know that l came last in 10 races but l have come 1st in 50 races as well. l'll speak to Billy. - lt's of no use. He'll not meet you.

However, even these will be of no use ahead. - Why? House loans... installments for 6 months. So, what's the big deal? We could sell some of our things... We can't sell! Nothing is ours. All are purchased either on loan or credit card. These furniture, carpet, curtains, our clothes, your suit. Even your shoes too. Okay. l agree that we've taken all the things on loan. But, sometimes there's delay while repaying. So, they'll not remove us from the house? They can't do that? lf there's anything short in life or lf there's a bit of tear in your eyes...

What does reliaity show means? lt's reality & not reliaity. There are separate teams in it. They have to stay at some weird place. Say, some island, holiday towers or a jungle. There are hidden cameras, which shoots every team. Then, the best team is the winner! Simple. Where we have to live? ln a small house, just like poor people lives in.. And we'll have only $ 2000. But, we'll never be sad. This way... Someone might be watching us from the hidden camera. lf anyone sees us this way... then we are out! We need to remain happy... always! This way... And the team which remains happy for the most number of days in $ 2000, will be the winners!! Okay. Who'll play 'Don't worry, Be happy' Promise me it's a game & school... You'll not have to leave school. l promise! Show your tongue. Black or Pink? - Pink. lf any storm comes, let it come... The lamp in your heart shouldn't go off! Let there be black nights...

Excuse me, can you tell me where's building # 216 is? Daddy, we are back here again. Oheers!! Bloody... - No, R.V. Bruno, come here Bruno. Hey, don't worry. They're all playing the game. But, knife? - Toy knife!. They are trying to scare us. What Mama? Yes, so that we are out! But, are we stupid to get out of fear? l'm not stupid. -Yes, you are not! But, we have to be very careful!

How diffiicult it is to get a New York license? lt's not free. One has to spend thousands of dollars to get it. Why can't you drive? l could go back & change tyres. l could deliver Pizzas. l could even wash utensils in a restaurant. l could do anything, but l can't drive a taxi. Because l drive only to race! l couldn't beg from the passengers holding my hands. Where is the question ofjoining hands? You'll not understand... l'll not drive a taxi & that's final!
