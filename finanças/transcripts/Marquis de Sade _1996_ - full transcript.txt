(ominous orchestral music) - [Donatien] It is only for the proper instruction of man and the general improvement of his morals that I begin the task of telling this story. May the reader always keep in mind an awareness of the dangers which forever nip at the heels of those who are obsessed with satisfying their desires, and who to that end will stop at nothing. (suspenseful orchestral music) Let the reader be generous and forgiving of the vile and revolting description of the crime which we necessarily must give in all its abhorrent detail. (fabric ripping) (woman gasps) Though can one hope to inspire in others that feeling of disgust and moral outrage against such crimes unless one lays them bare in exact detail, exposing them to the bright light of truth, revealing all (whip snaps) (woman cries out) and hiding nothing. (woman grunts) And now dear reader you must prepare your heart and your mind for the most impure tale that has ever been told. (doorknocker tapping) - [Inspector] Open up. (fist banging) (crowd shouting) - [Maid] What is your business? - I'm here to arrest the master of this house. (crowd shouting) (horse hooves clomping) Out of here, de Sade. (Renee gasps) - [Woman] How dare you? - My apologies, madam. I'm here to arrest your husband. - He's not here. - [Inspector] Do you know where he is? - No. - Renee. Tell him. - The same place he is every night, I suppose. (harpsichord music) (woman laughing) (men and women chattering) - They're after the master. - What do we do? - We're his accomplices, you fool. Let's go. - Oh, aw. - Where is the Marquis de Sade? - When the police floor a prostitute, it is justice, but when the Marquis amuses himself a little with a whip, it is a crime. - Just tell me where he is. (Madame de Montreuil grunts) (woman laughs) (suspenseful orchestral music) Put down that whip. You are under arrest, Marquis de Sade. (Donatien laughs) - For consorting with prostitutes? Surely these charges are hardly worthy of your time or mine. Perhaps we can come to an understanding. - Put your purse away. The charges include kidnapping, rape, and murder. - I can assure you, Inspector Marais, that in spite of this woman's appearance, she has been neither kidnapped nor raped, and most assuredly not murdered. Although I must admit that her performance was rather corpse like this evening. - The charges do not pertain to this or any other courtesan. - Then to whom do they pertain, Inspector? - To three daughters of society who were in turn abducted, violated, and choked to death. - You didn't say anything about choking. - Quiet, Rose. Surely you don't believe that I had anything to do with what happened to those women. - No, monsieur, nothing at all. Shackle him. - This is preposterous. You have no evidence. - I have all the evidence I need, monsieur. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Order, order. (gavel thudding) Will the defendant rise? Marquis Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois de Sade, a procession of women have testified that the sexual perversities you write about are in fact the sexual perversities you practice. - I don't have to practice, Your Honor. I am very good at them. (women giggle) - Your own wife and mother-in-law were unable to verify your whereabouts on the three nights in question. - What is the point of all this, Your Honor? - You have been found guilty of all charges by a jury of your peers. I hereby sentence you to death by the guillotine. (observers chattering) The execution will be held in the Place des Graves five days from now. In addition, you're so-called novel shall be burnt and the ashes scattered to the four winds. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, you slaughterers! (gavel thudding) Brainwashed slaughterers! - Court is adjourned. (inmates crying out) - Surely you don't expect to incarcerate me with these common criminals. - Sorry, but the Bastille doesn't have any private suites. - What about solitary confinement? - That's only for the unruly inmates. - Unruly? What constitutes unruly? - Fighting with other prisoners, night screams, (inmates shouting) throwing feces. - Such unseemly behavior would hardly befit a man of my lineage. - You could always attack a jailer. - What an excellent idea. (heads thud) - Hey! (fist thuds) (guard grunts) (somber orchestral music) (pedestrians chattering) - [Man] Come on, come on, come on. Back to business. (men chattering) For the rest of my life. - Pardon me, monsieur. I seem to be lost. - Well, join our cause and we will help you to find the way. (men chuckle) - No, you misunderstand. I'm not a rebel. - No, no, that's quite clear. - I'm looking for the Chateau de Sade. - You've found it. (men laugh) - But that is the Bastille. - That's right. I think the lord of the manor is at home. (men laugh) Now Valere, bring the rapier. Remember, the Places des Graves. (whip cracks) (Donatien grunts) (Donatien cries out) - Better have a good reason for disturbing me at this time of night. (Donatien cries out) - I apologize, Inspector, but we're having trouble executing the 40 lashes you ordered for de Sade. - What seems to be the problem? (Donatien laughing) - I think he likes it. (whip cracks) (Donatien shouts) (Donatien laughing) - Don't worry, there are better ways of punishing a man like the Marquis. (Donatien grunts) (whip cracks) (inspector laughs) - The devil has cast me into prison. Only the Lord can set me free. Surely his goodness and mercy shall be my salvation. - I'd rather have a good lawyer. - Release my soul from torment that I may praise thy name in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. - Idiot! - Thy kingdom come... - Inspector, there's someone to see you. (townspeople chattering) - Yes, mademoiselle, what is it you want? - I want to see the Marquis de Sade. - No one can see the Marquis de Sade. - Why not? - For the reason that you would not feed a caged animal at the zoo. - And that is? - Because if you do, he is likely to take your hand off. - I don't intend to feed him, Inspector. - The sight of you would be food enough for him. - Please, Inspector. It's imperative that I speak with the Marquis. - Then make an application through the court. Keep her out. - [Man] Bring it along. (door slams) (bird wings flapping) (suspenseful music) (Donatien grunting) (suspenseful orchestral music) (teeth crunching) - [Donatien] Now, dear reader, you must prepare you heart and your mind for the most impure tale that has ever been told. - Because the hand with which you steal is offensive to both God and this bench, I sentence that it be cut off. (men grumbling) - But I only stole to feed my family. - Consider yourself lucky. The next time you're caught steeling it will be your head. (gavel thudding) Next case. - May I be heard, Your Honor? - On what matter? - I'm trying to gain permission to visit one of the inmates of the Bastille. - Which inmate? - The Marquis de Sade. - What? (observers chattering) - Order, order. (gavel thudding) Why would a lady such as yourself want to see that scoundrel? - He was my sister's benefactor. She was to return to our home last month but never arrived. Hearing that young girls are disappearing all over Paris I was concerned. I came to look for her. - You claim the Marquis de Sade was her benefactor? - Yes. According to her letters he was a kind and generous man, a patron of the arts. (observers laughing) - Quiet. Quiet! (gavel thudding) - I don't understand. - Mademoiselle, the only thing de Sade is a patron of is prostitutes. (observers chattering) - My sister is an actress. (observers laughing) - Mm, yes. Of course. She would have to be. - Will you allow me to see the Marquis or not? - I'm sorry. I will not bend the rules because you are worried about the welfare of an actress. Court is adjourned. (somber orchestral music) (gavel thuds) (suspenseful orchestral music) (horse whinnies) (Justine knocking) - I'd like to see the Marquis de Sade. - You heard what the inspector said. No visitors. - Oh, well the inspector doesn't have to know. - Why shall we let you bring dinner to that murdering scum while honest men like us starve? - Oh, this isn't for him. No. (chuckles) It's for you. - Mm. (sniffs) Chicken. (inmates crying out) - What is wrong with these men? - They're insane. - And the Marquis, does he behave in the same manner? - There is nothing wrong with his manners. - Thank God. - That's what makes him so dangerous. (ominous music) (inmates chattering) (somber orchestral music) - You have a visitor, de Sade. - Tell Father Paul that he's wasting his time. I have no soul left to lose. (door slams) - Everyone has a soul, Monsieur de Sade, including you. - Am I hallucinating? Speak again, bright angel. - I'm sorry for interrupting your work. - Not at all. I wanted to take a rest. All this writing has left me quite drained. (inmate cries out) - You're writing with your own blood? - Not to mention my sweat, my tears. - I could never imagine doing such a thing. - Then you are very lucky, indeed, for I am cursed with an imagination which envisions everything. For instance, right now I am picturing what you would look like stripped of your dress. Would your breasts be as supple as they appear under your bodice? Would your skin be as white as virgin snow? - Please stop. - Tell me, what is the name of the creature which blushes so easily? - Justine. - Justine. How perfect. - I beg your pardon? - Just, meaning that which is good, and tine, meaning to be filled. Tell me, Justine, are you as filled with goodness as your name implies? - Your tone is quite improper, monsieur. I must insist that you hold your tongue. - I'd rather you hold it. - I did not come here to be insulted. - No, you came here in search of your sister. (suspenseful orchestral music) - How did you know? - The family resemblance is quite obvious. - Please, tell me what you know of her. I'm quite concerned for her well-being. - As well you should be. After all, look at the company she kept. - They told me you were a monster. Did you do to her what you did to those other women? - I'm sorry, you must excuse me. My creative juices are flowing again. - What are you writing that is so important? - The more accurate question would be what I am rewriting, and it is very important indeed. The unpublished manuscript, which has condemned me to my death. - If it wasn't published, how did it incriminate you? - Unpublished does not mean unread. - Who read it? - My mother-in-law. Sit down, Justine, and let me tell you a tale of how I came to be in this dark and dismal place. (bright harpsichord music) - Take Renee to be your wife? - [Donatien] Like most mother-in-laws, Madame de Montreuil found fault with the man that her daughter was about to marry. She thought him to be a dishonest, dishonorable rogue. Unlike most mother-in-laws, she was right. - And do you, Renee, take Donatien to be your husband, to forsake all others-- - Madame de Montreuil knew that I was marrying Renee not because I was in love, but because I was experiencing something far more compelling, bankruptcy. - I do. - By the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (guests chattering) (Donatien laughing) (light orchestral music) (guests chattering) - [Woman] Thank you. (guests chattering) - [Donatien] It's right here, but it's (mumbles). Lovely, lovely. Yes, thank you. (guests chattering) - [Woman] Lovely. - [Donatien] You're right, right. And yes, the family does have a chateau there. (guests chattering) (women laughing) - Thank you all for having come today. The happiest day of my life, the day of my wedding. A toast to my wife. Mm. - Disgraceful. - I could not agree more. Excuse me, Father. - Wipe my lips, my darling. Wipe my lips. (women chattering) - Donatien. - Hm? - This behavior is quite unbecoming for an aristocrat. - But Madame de Montreuil, these girls are my sisters. (women giggle) What could possibly be wrong with kissing one's sisters? - You are humiliating your bride. - Mm, she'll get used to it. Mm. (smacking kisses) - By the way, do these women know that you are bankrupt? - What? - That's correct, ladies, completely bankrupt and utterly dependent on his wife, even for his pocket money. Well, none of you will see one sous tonight unless you smile, curtsy, and leave without so much as a backwards glance. - Oh. (women grunt) - [Woman] Come on, girls, let's go. - I hope you're happy! - Donatien, do not make a mistake. I will not allow you to disgrace my daughter. If you insist on misbehaving, I will see to it that your movements are, shall we say, restricted. (chuckles) I am extremely well connected. And I can afford to pay for favors. I suggest that you dance with your wife. (light orchestral music) (guests chattering) - [Man] Come along now. (guests chattering) - [Donatien] And that was the beginning of the dance, not the one Renee and I did in public, but the dance we did in private. At first I tried to hide my debauchery from my wife, but it was difficult under Madame de Montreuil's watchful eye, especially when the bills came. - Thank you. (Madame de Montreuil humming) Explain this. - It is a bill for 6,000 livre. - Who is Madame de Florville? - She runs a home for wayward girls. - In other words, a brothel. - I'm sure that a great many of those poor creatures have done things they're not proud of. The 6,000 I donated, however, were for charity. - When are you going to get a profession? - I have a profession. I am a writer. - No, a real profession. I mean one that pays better than being a rake. - Let us make a very clear distinction between two very separate things, madam. I may be your son-in-law, but I am not your dupe. I venture to say that my writings will not only make me rich, but famous beyond all imagination. - (laughs) What do you know about literature? You are a writer? (Madame de Montreuil laughing) (soft piano music) - Latour! - Yes, monsieur? - My coach. - Where are you going, Donatien? - Out. - At this time of night? - There is something that I am in need of. - [Renee] What? - Inspiration. (suspenseful music) - I hope the ride wasn't too rough for you, Monsieur le Marquis. - Not at all, Gaufridy. You have an excellent command of the reigns and appear to be quite capable of handling a whip, which gives me an idea. - Sir? - Come along, Gaufridy. You, too, Latour. Tonight will be a night you can tell your illegitimate grandchildren about. (patrons and prostitutes chattering) There appears to be more inspiration here than there is on Mt. Olympus. - Begging your pardon, monsieur, but may I ask what you require of us? - An author must remain an objective observer. You and Gaufridy are going to give me something to observe. (speaking in foreign language) What a man buys in a house of ill repute is not flesh, but freedom. The freedom to be what he truly is, an animal that wants to devour the prey which he hungers for. (whip cracks) (woman grunts) Consume it completely. (whip cracks) (woman grunts) Leaving nothing but the bare bones of its carcass. - Have you been writing all night? - Most of it, my darling, most of it. - Then you found your inspiration. - Let's just say I was kissed by a muse. - Yes. I see. - [Donatien] I suddenly realized the toll my infidelities were taking on my wife. Looking at her hurt and humiliated face I was overcome with a sense of euphoria. (women giggling) From then on I no longer hid my infidelities from my wife. (somber orchestral music) In fact, I flaunted them in front of her. (women giggling) I went so far as to take the chambermaid in our own home. (chambermaid gasps) - [Chambermaid] Please, no. (chambermaid groaning) - [Donatien] Finally she could no longer stay silent. - It's bad enough that you're unfaithful to me, Donatien, why must you do it with the servants? - Because they are cleaner than prostitutes and just as obedient. More wine, my dear? - I find your behavior disgusting. - Yes, I don't blame you. - How would it make you feel if you caught me with Latour and Gaufridy? (suspenseful music) - What an intriguing question. I suppose there's only one way to find out. (fingers snapping) - [Renee] (gasps) No! No! No! (screams) - Renee? - [Renee] No! (crying) (Madame de Montreuil grunting) - [Madame de Montreuil] Open the door. (Renee cries out) Open this door. (Donatien laughing) (Madame de Montreuil sighs) (Donatien laughing) (Renee crying) (Madame de Montreuil groans) (Donatien laughing) (Renee crying) - [Renee] Please. (Donatien laughing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Donatien] I find pleasure in humiliation. No other thrill is quite so forbidden as profaning that which is sacred. - [Madame de Montreuil] I found this in his study. - The title is certainly shocking. - It's shocking and more. Shall we say that it's everything we need it to be? (gavel thudding) - Marquis de Sade, you've been charged with the writing of pornography. How do you plead? - Not guilty. - You deny that you are the author of this book? - No, I deny that it is pornography. - One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom? The title alone is enough for us to lock you up. - Am I to understand that you did not find it necessary to read the book? - That's enough. Gentlemen, I think I'll... - We go ahead, yes? - Yes. - Our council finds you guilty. - In lieu of imprisonment, you're fined 5,000 livres and consigned safe keeping of your wife's family as a guarantee for your future good behavior. - Your manuscript we order to be destroyed. (ominous music) - They're just words, Your Honor. - Yes, words that can be used as a blueprint for evil. - A blueprint for evil, Monsieur de Marquis. Can you imagine the consequences for society if people were to commit the acts that you describe? - How do you know they're not committing them already? - What are you saying, Monsieur de Sade? - Simply that art imitates life. - Whose life? - Whose life, indeed. - Is your book an autobiography, Monsieur de Sade? - All authors write about what they know, mademoiselle. - So you admit to being a murderer? - I admit to being many things, but murderer is one thing I am not. - So you maintain that you are innocent? - Innocent is something else I am not. In my novel, the countess is kidnapped and raped. Yes, even choked during intercourse, but she does not die. She is taken right to the moment of death and then released. Ah, the ecstasy she must have felt. - Ecstasy? - Can you imagine being brought back to life, to breathe again, feeling the blood pounding in your veins? - But you haven't told me anything about my sister. - [Donatien] Nor do I intend to, not without some sort of inducement. - I beg your pardon? - Oh come now, mademoiselle. Don't play coy with me. Surely you must have bribed someone to get in here. Who was it? Was it Inspector Marais? Did you offer him some sexual favor? Tit for tat as it were? - Certainly not. All I did was bring the guards dinner. - I'd settle for some dessert. - I'm not a prostitute, Monsieur de Sade. - We are all prostitutes, mademoiselle, myself included. Fortunately for you I can be bought rather cheaply. - What do you want? - A quill and some decent parchment. - That's all? I thought you'd want the world. - It is the world. My novel is the only world I can live in. But if I continue writing in this vein, I shall bleed to death before they can execute me. - You don't seem very concerned about dying. - On the contrary, mademoiselle. Dying is my only concern. Why do you think that I am trying to recreate my manuscript in five days? It is my one hope for immortality. (suspenseful music) - Get them up against the barricade. The soldiers won't be able to turn around, yeah? That way we'll attack the aristocrats! - [Rebel] Yes, of course! - Yes! (men laughing) - [Marquis de Sade] Justine. Speak again, bright angel. (suspenseful orchestral music) (blade thuds) (inmates shouting) - [Justine] I brought your writing supplies, Monsieur de Sade. - [Donatien] They're not my writing supplies. - I beg your pardon? - They're yours. - I don't understand. Why are you staring at me that way? - I was wondering what your neck would smell like. - I came here to talk about my sister. - And indeed we shall. But first I want to smell your neck. - I brought you the paper and quill you asked for. Isn't that enough? - I'm sorry, it's not. Need your neck. - This is a rouse. I'm beginning to think you were no more than a casual acquaintance of Juliette. - Jasmine. - What did you say? - Jasmine, that was your sister's favorite perfume. - That's right. - Tell me, do you wear the same scent? (somber piano music) Come closer. Closer. Mm, indeed you do. Seems that you and your sister are two of a kind. (suspenseful music) - (gasps) How dare you? I came here to talk about my sister. - Patience, my dear. You won't get anywhere if you put the cart before the horse. This is a journey that must start at the beginning. - I'll listen. - I want you to do more than just listen. I want you to take dictation. Now, where was I? Ah yes, chapter six I think you'll find this section remarkably interesting. - I'm only interested in what happened to my sister. - I call it Seduction of an Actress. (suspenseful music) I first saw the girl performing with a wandering theater troupe in a street comedy. (audience laughing) - Ah ha! I've got you, you trollop! (audience laughs) - How vulgar. - I couldn't agree with you more. - [Actor] You scoundrel. This lady does not believe in free love. - That's right. You must pay for it. - [Actor] Pay for it? - Get the little sow for me. - She is my wife! - I should charge you. Come with me, my darling. (Juliette laughs) (audience applauds) - Encore! - Bravo! - Bravo! Bravo! (audience applauds) - [Latour] (mumbles) Mademoiselle, my master would like-- - [Woman] Bravo! (audience chattering) (suspenseful music) - Please. - Encore. (soft harpsichord music) - I was very grateful for your invitation, Monsieur de Sade. I've not had a decent meal since I left home. - Well perhaps I can be of some assistance in that area. - Are you a producer. - In a manner of speaking, yes. I've been known to put on a show from time to time. But what I am most interested in is the development of young talent such as yourself and I must say, you show a great deal of promise. - Do you really think so? - Absolutely. But I admit I did not find your courtesan very believable. Being from such a well-bred family, I doubt that you've ever even seen a lady of the evening. - Well, no. - Then how do you expect to portray someone you know absolutely nothing about? - I don't know. - Put yourself in my hands. When I am through with you and your training is complete, you will make a most convincing prostitute, I assure you. (women laughing) - Oh! - [Man] Get back here. (women laughing) - Monsieur, what are we doing in this place? - Beginning your training, mademoiselle. - [Madame de Florville] Well look who's here. - [Donatien] Madame de Florville. - Well, what's this? - Madame de Florville, this is Juliette, a young actress. She is in need of a costume. Perhaps you could open your wardrobe for her. - It would be my pleasure. Come along, little lamb. (Donatien knocking) - [Donatien] How's it going in there? - See for yourself. - [Prostitute] Woo! - But lo, what light through yonder window breaks. It is the east and Juliette is the sun. (prostitutes and clients chattering) - Why must I dress like a-- - Prostitute? How else are you going to fit in? - Fit in where? (dramatic music) - [Man] We need fresh blood. - [Prostitute] Hang on, baby. (prostitutes and clients chattering) - Yes! - Oh! - Come on now. (prostitutes and clients chattering) - Yes! (women squeal) - Bring her here. - Woo! - [Man] Come on. (prostitutes and clients chattering) - [Juliette] Wait. (ominous music) (prostitutes and clients chattering) - [Prostitute] Here now, here now! (prostitutes and clients chattering) (Juliette breathing heavily) - You. What are you doing? - I was just looking for the theater company. - The theater company left, which is what I would advise you to do. - But I have nowhere to go. - You will go to jail if I catch you soliciting here again. - But I am not soliciting. - Be gone. Now. Go! (suspenseful orchestral music) (Juliette knocking) - Is the Marquis de Sade home? - There, there. - My troupe left without me. I have no job, no place to stay. - Dry your eyes, my dear. These things have a way of working themselves out. (coins jingling) - I can't take your money. (suspenseful music) - It's not my money, it's yours. - I don't understand. - You said you wanted a job. I'm hiring you. - Are you mounting a production? - In a manner of speaking, yes. - Is there a part for me? - Indeed there is. It's a hard part, but I think you can handle it. - No, no, monsieur. I can't. - You're an excellent performer. Now perform. (whip cracks) (Juliette gasps) Are you getting all this? - That actress, she was my sister wasn't she? - Good! You are getting it. Shall we go on to chapter seven? - What makes you do such a thing? - Because it is humiliation which makes sex pleasurable. Therefore, the more humiliating it is, the more pleasurable it becomes. That's rather good. Write it down. - But why Juliette? - To humiliate a whore is somewhat difficult. A servant is slightly more difficult to seduce. A wife is a greater challenge, but having accomplished that, the only thrill left would be the corruption of a proper young lady. What could be more exhilarating than to make her betray the false morality with which she was inculcated? Except of course to do the same thing to her sister. (dramatic music) - (grunts) You are a monster. - Flattery will get you everywhere. - What became of Juliette? - (clears throat) Time to go, mademoiselle. - Answer my question. - [Guard] Now, mademoiselle. Inspector Marais is on his way. If he finds you here you'll be arrested. - Wait. My pages. - Here, take them. - No, no. You take them. And you take these as well. - But why? - Marais is coming to inspect my cell. If he finds these, he will destroy them. Please, be my keeper of secrets. - Now, mademoiselle. - And if I agree? - I promise I will tell you what happened to your sister. (suspenseful music) - On your feet! Clear that gangway! This is not a Sunday picnic, you imbeciles. You haven't got the brains you were born with. (guard grumbles) (inmates crying out) Where is it? - What? - Your manuscript. - Oh, those pious idiots at your so-called council for decency confiscated it, remember? (inmates crying out) - Has he received any visitors? - Yes, sir. - No, no, Inspector. Not a one. - Well which is it? Yes or no? - I think no, Inspector. - No. No one. No. - How did he get these? - The guards gave them to me. - We did? - You admit it? - [Donatien] They were only doing their job, Inspector. - We were? - You sound mightily confident, monsieur. - The law stipulates that a prisoner condemned to death is allowed to make out his last will and testament. - These pages are blank. - Writer's block. - You're quite sure that he has not received any visitors? - Yes, sir. (suspenseful drum roll music) - If I find you two are lying, his will not be the only head to roll. (rebels laughing) - Stupid aristocrats. (rebels laughing) - Ooh! (rebels chattering) - [Rebel] Look at those two! (rebels chattering) - Rich man. Where are you going? (rebels chattering) - Stop! (inspector huffs) So you like to bully people do you? (suspenseful music) How would you like to bully me? - No. No, no, no. - Watch it. - I'll watch it. (speaking in foreign language) - Come on. - Go away. (rebel spits) (speaking in foreign language) (soft orchestral music) (rebels chattering) - Justine. (angelic chanting music) Justine. (suspenseful music) I've been waiting for you. - Take me. (angelic chanting music) (Justine gasps) (ominous orchestral music) (Justine gasping) (soft orchestral music) - Good afternoon, madam. I trust I find you well. - Very well. - Nothing seems to change you, madam. (Madame de Montreuil chuckles) You're as beautiful as ever. - I think we have some business to transact. - Oh. You are very eager, madam. - As long as he's in prison, the management of the Marquis's affairs is in my hands and I feel fully justified in selling certain parts of his property to a respectable buyer. I believe all that is required are two signatures, yours and mine. - The Marquis will surely congratulate himself on having such a reliable trustee, madam. (crowd shouting) (ominous music) - [Donatien] I was convinced that you were never coming back. - I read your manuscript last night. - And? - And I found it repulsive. - Everyone's a critic. - If you'll just tell me what became of Juliette, I'll be on my way. - Can't you see that that is precisely why I can not tell you anything about her? - Monsieur, you gave me your word. - And if I tell you of your sister's whereabouts you will abandon me. - I won't abandon you. I'll return in two days to collect the rest of your manuscript. - No! No, that is not good enough! I need you here until... (crowd shouting) (ominous music) - [Man] Do it! Do it! (crowd shouting) (blade thuds) (woman screams) (crowd shouting) - No, no! (crowd shouting) - I have completed three more chapters. The first two deal with the alleged kidnappings of Mademoiselle Chinon and Mademoiselle Douville. The third outlines the torture of an innocent young lady. - So the only way to possess a woman is to abuse her? - Pain is remembered long after pleasure is forgotten. I have got the scars to prove it. (inmate groaning) - [Justine] Who gave them to you? - Are you trying to understand me, mademoiselle? - No! Yes. I don't know. I'm just trying to understand how you became like this. - I didn't become anything. I am what I am just as a beast is what it is. You are the same, only you don't know it, yet. There are men who don't behave as you do, who don't feel as you do. - Where in the world did you read that? - It's true. - Where are these men? (ominous music) The guards who devour the roasted chicken that you bribed them with? They would much rather plunge their tongue into your body, I can assure you. Who then? The judge who every day condemns men to the scaffold for the crime of stealing bread? - Have you never known love? - Now there is a word that is truly obscene. Love. Whatever poet created it did the world far more harm than my writings ever could. - But love is what we all aspire to. - Exactly, mademoiselle, what we aspire to but never achieve. Love is an illusion. The most we can hope from life is passion. - But I don't understand. How can you have one without the other? - Are you in love with me, mademoiselle? - No. How could you even suggest such a thing? - I didn't suggest it, you did. - When? - When you said you couldn't have passion without love. - No. You're twisting my words. - Do you deny that your heart beats faster when you're in my presence? When you lie in your bed at night it's me that you see, a demon lover that possesses you body and soul? Tell me it's not what you want to be licked, to be sucked, to be fucked. Your breath is so fleeting you can not answer. Give in to your desires, know my darkness. (Justine whimpering) (rebels chattering) - Come on. - For what? (rebels shouting) - What are you doing? (rebels shouting) - Hey! - Get out of here. (rebels shouting) - [Rebel] Get out of here. - [Rebel] Go away. Go on! - [Rebel] Get outta here. - [Justine] Let me by. - Shh. - Hello. (man whistles) - [Rebel] Oh come on, let her go. Let her go. - [Rebel] I am so tired. (rebels chattering) (crickets chirping) - [Donatien] As a writer, I'm used to manipulating my characters, deciding who lives and who dies. How I wish the power I wield over paper and ink would extend to flesh and blood. Toward that end, I have devised the following torture to be administered over a two week period. (suspenseful music) Day one. The victim is taken to some isolated place where her screams will never be heard or her body ever found. (Juliette whimpering) Day two and three. The girl is tied up by her wrists. Her future master watches as she struggles against the acts that she will eventually perform willingly. (ominous music) (Juliette grunting) Day four and five. The withholding of food and water starves and dehydrates the subject. On day six she is tortured by the sight and smell of food she can not consume. Day seven. The conquest is fed by her captors. She ravenously consumes everything offered to her, including pastries laced with Spanish fly. (suspenseful music) The drug will have worn off by the end of the eighth day and the submissive will wake to find that she has been violated. Seeing her chance for escape, she flees. This false sense of freedom is the cruelest torture of all for the men released their prey just to hunt it down and return it to captivity. (ominous orchestral music) (Juliette breathing heavily) (Juliette gasps) On day nine she receives punishment for attempting to escape. (whip smacks) (Juliette gasps) - Oh. (ominous music) - Day 10. The torture continues. Day 11. The girl's wounds are washed and she is made to feel safe, but on day 12 she will be expected to repay her masters for their kindness. However, if the submissive does not perform with the proper enthusiasm, and they never do, she is punished again on day 13, this time by branding. (Juliette screaming) (Donatien laughs) The 14th and final day. The captive is unchained. She now willingly accepts any indignity imposed on her, which is her fatal mistake. Now there is only one manipulation left. (Juliette grunting) Death. Countrymen! Comrades! This is de Sade! (speaking in foreign language) They are murdering people in the Bastille! (townspeople shouting) Mademoiselle Justine, the revolution is on its way. Too bad I won't be here. - You sound as though you're in favor of revolution. - Of course I'm in favor of the revolution. What do you think my writing has been trying to accomplish? - Well I would hardly call your writings revolutionary. - Perhaps you wouldn't, mademoiselle, but someday others will. - Why haven't you written about the strangulation of the countess? - But I have. It's here in chapter 11. I've also completed chapters 12 and 13. - Have you altered the order of your kidnappings from your original manuscript? - No, of course not. I have followed the outline exactly as in the original. - So the strangulation of the countess always followed the two week torture? - Yes. Of course. Why do you ask? - The authorities charged you with reenacting your novel chapter by chapter. Why would you break your pattern by skipping the two week torture? - You tell me, Inspector Mademoiselle. - I don't think you skipped it at all. I believe you were arrested halfway through tormenting your victim, a young girl whom the authorities don't even know is missing. - What is your point? - I think that girl is my sister. - Well then she is very lucky indeed, because I could hardly torture her here within this cell. - You can't, but your servants can. They fled and were never caught. (Donatien laughs) - You have quite an imagination. Perhaps you should be a writer. - Please, if I'm right Juliette has only one day left. - And so do I! And I still have five more chapters to complete. (ominous music) - You will have to write more than that unless you help me. - Are you threatening me? - It's not a threat. I'll burn every last page. - You wouldn't dare. What are you doing? - What happened to my sister? - I don't know! - I don't believe you. Where is she? - How many times are you going to ask me that question? - How many chapters did you write? - What do you want? - The truth. - All right. The truth. I will tell you what happened to your sister. One day a letter arrived from my wife announcing her return from Marseilles and more importantly the return of my mother-in-law. It was time for Juliette to make her own living as I had taught her. This is the only place in Paris where the haves mingle with the have nots. Madame de Florville should have no trouble finding you a proper gentleman to take you as his mistress. - What about you? - Why would you want to stay with me? These men have more money and fewer perversions than I do. - But you're the one I'm in love with. - Impossible. (ominous orchestral music) That was the first and the last time that the corruption was so thorough and so complete that the victim actually became an extension of myself. It frightened me. - Go on. - That is all there is, mademoiselle. - But you haven't told me that man's name. - What man? - The man Madame de Florville found to be Juliette's benefactor. - You would have to ask her. - Monsieur, you promised to tell me everything! - And I have told you everything I know. - Damn you. You tell me where that brothel is. (men chattering) (prostitutes giggling) - [Prostitute] Oh. (men and women chattering) - Oh! (women laughing) - The captain and his privates are waiting in room five. And by his privates I don't mean his soldiers. - Are you Madame de Florville? - The one and only. Are you looking for a job? - I'm looking for my sister. - Too bad. With all the troops stationed here I could use another girl. So could the captain. Back upstairs, Giselle! - [Man] This one has a sister! - [Prostitute] Come, Sergeant. - Is Juliette here? - No, but I wish she were. - Do you know her whereabouts? - Look, missy, I'm trying to do my patriotic duty and support the troops. I don't have time. - I'll pay you for your time. - What do you want to know? - The name of Juliette's benefactor. - (giggles) The Marquis de Sade. - You don't understand. The Marquis de Sade is the man who brought my sister here. - And he's also the one who took her away. (suspenseful music) I had negotiated a very handsome price for Juliette with Count Rougemont, but that night the Marquis returned for her. He wore his usual mask, but this time not in order to conceal his identity, but to conceal his fear. - His fear of what? - De Sade couldn't bear the thought of another man possessing the masterpiece that he created. - But where can she be? - He was keeping her at his villa, but... - Yes? - After his arrest the villa was sold by his mother-in-law to an old family friend. - Then where can he have Juliette hidden? - I don't know. In his cell? (laughs) (suspenseful music) (guards laughing) - No, no, no more visits, mademoiselle. - Please, I just need five minutes. - It'll cost you. (guards laughing) - But I don't have anymore money. - But you've got something as good as money. (guard laughing) (crowd shouting) (harpsichord music) (crowd shouting) - Hang the pervert! - [Donatien] It is finished. - So am I. Finished listening to your lies. (crowd shouting) - Who did this to you? - You did. - I do not understand. - Tell me the truth. Madame de Florville said you took Juliette away because you were in love with her. - That is ludicrous. - Please, monsieur, the executioner is readying the guillotine. As a dying man I implore you, confess your sins so that you may be welcomed into heaven. (Justine crying) - What a paragon of virtue you are. (crowd shouting) In one breath you not only plead for your sister's life, but for my soul as well. - My intention is not to intrigue you. I am trying to save you. - Save me? From what? Hell sounds infinitely more intriguing than heaven. - You have been torturing me for the past five days with false promises. I beg of you release me, release Juliette. - Where in blazes do you think I am keeping her, under my cot? - In your novel you wrote about a secret place cut off from civilization. Does such a place exist? - Yes, of course. My chateau, my villa. - No, your villa has been sold. - By whom? - Your mother-in-law sold it to an old friend. - My mother-in-law. Oh yes, she has many old friends in high places. I am sure they're making very good use of it as well. (crowd shouting) Wait. - [Justine] What is it? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Blueprint of a murder. My property, my liberty, my life, may not be the only thing she has taken away from me. Justine, your dear sister may still be alive. - How? Where? - That masked man who took her away may be the same man who has taken away my villa. Using it. - Using it for what? - For murder, mademoiselle. For rape, torture, and murder. - [Guard] It's time, de Sade. - You must do everything in your power to stay this execution. - I can't do that. - If you do not, you shall never see your sister alive again. - Let's go. - [Woman] In the name of God and all that is good! - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die. - [Woman] Kill the bastard! (townspeople shouting) - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die, die, die! (townspeople shouting) - [Man] Kill the bastard! - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die, die, die! Die, die, die, die, die! (crowd shouting) - [Woman] Off with his head! - Please. Someone help me. - [Crowd] Die, die, die! - [Woman] Kill him! Behead him! - [Man] Off with his head! - [Man] Kill the pervert! - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die, die, die! (man shouts) Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die! - [Justine] You must halt this execution. - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die, die! - Please, you've got to help me stop this! (crowd shouting) - All right, I'll stop it. (suspenseful music) - [Crowd] Die, die, die, die! - No! (gun fires) (woman screams) (crowd shouting) (dramatic music) (blade thuds) - Get him. (crowd shouting) Get de Sade. - [Man] Marquis de Sade. - Ha! - [Soldier] On guard! (swords clanking) (crowd shouting) - [Man] Monsieur de Sade. - Quiet, quiet! - [Soldier] Drop your blade, monsieur. Drop it. (swords clanking) Drop it. (crowd shouting) (swords clanking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (soldier grunts) - We meet again, mademoiselle. (crowd shouting) - Stop him! Stop de Sade. Get him, you fools. - [Man] What a guy. (gun fires) (rebel grunts) - [Inspector] After them! (men chattering) - [Man] Hold him. (men chattering) Get 'em all. Come on. - [Soldier] Gotta get them all. (men chattering) - Why did you bring me here? - Because we are in hiding. - For how long? - Until the carriage arrives. - What carriage? - The one that is going to take us to your sister. - Shouldn't we go to the police? (Donatien laughs) - Oh, my darling, you are so naive. To virtue and to fortune. Or should I say misfortune. (glasses clink) (wagon rattling) (horse hooves clomping) Let's go. - It's good to see you, Monsieur de Sade. - And you, Latour. - Latour, what is he doing here? - These are my trusted servants. They shall aid our escape. - But-- - Let's go! (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Follow! (horse hooves clomping) - Where exactly are we going? - To my chateau. - Why would anyone want a villa so cut off from civilization? - What better place is there to do uncivilized things? (leaves rustling) (suspenseful orchestral music) Those are Inspector Marais's lieutenants. - Well what do they want? - Me of course. (guns firing) (speaking in foreign language) - Ya ho! (whip cracks) Ya ha! Yee ha! (gun fires) Go! - They're coming closer. (gun fires) (Latour grunts) - This damn carriage is too heavy. - Go, go! (whip cracks) (guns fire) - Ya! - Shall have to lighten our load. - How? (Justine gasps) - [Latour] Ha! (crickets chirping) (Justine grunts) - Monsieur de Sade. Monsieur de Sade, wait. I need to rest. - All right, but only for a few moments. Must reach the chateau before daybreak. What is wrong? Why are you staring at me? - You said the man who kidnapped Juliette is the same man who framed you. - I believe it to be true. Why? - Then it's not your conscience you wish to clear, it's your name. - Do you suppose I care what others think, hm? Is there something wrong with me wanting to clear them both? No, I do not care what society thinks. But I do care what you think of me. - Why? - Because I love thee. (Justine laughs) - Love? You must be joking. Love is an illusion. "Whatever poet created that did the world more harm "than my writings ever could." You said so yourself. You are deluded. - Yes, perhaps I am. Nonetheless, I love thee. I have been touched by... - My goodness? My virtue? Or is it my goodness you wish to touch? (soft orchestral music) - Is that an offer, mademoiselle? - No, it's not. - (sighs) I... - [Justine] Where are you going? - To get your sister. (suspenseful orchestral music) (leaves rustling) (Justine gasps) (Justine cries out) (Justine whimpering) (Justine cries out) - Juliette! - [Judge] We meet again, mademoiselle. - It is you. I thought that you had changed. At least face me without your mask. (Justine gasps) - (laughs) I told de Sade his manuscript could be used as a blueprint for evil. (laughs) - Oh my God. - [Priest] God can't help you now my child. (Justine gasps) - Nor the police neither. But then you knew that, didn't you? (judge laughs) - No. No! No. (crying) (Justine gasps) (gun fires) (Justine screams) (dramatic orchestral music) (inspector grunts) (Juliette groans) (gun fires) (priest grunts) (Justine screams) - Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. - Stay back de Sade or I'll cut her. - Welcome to my hunting lodge, Judge de Bory. I'm very disappointed to find you such a mediocre student of my writings, Judge. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to watch her bleed. - No. - You moralistic little fool. You believed everything I told you in the woods, didn't you? It's your sister I really want. - Then I'll cut her instead. (gun fires) (Judge grunts) (flames whooshing) (Judge screaming) Help! Help me, somebody! Oh God! Oh mighty God! (screaming) (Justine whimpering) (somber orchestral music) (Justine crying) (somber orchestral music) - Justine, wait. - Juliette! - She doesn't want to see you. - What? - [Donatien] I'm taking her with me. - Why? Why would you do this to me? - Can't you see that Juliette and I are the same now, corrupted? And you... Knowing a soul as tender and sensitive as yours, knowing your heart, loving and compassionate, you will stay with me the rest of my life. (bright orchestral music) I am master of mine own disappointment. You'll be as well. (Justine crying) - No. (crying) - [Donatien] And so dear reader, let us leave the sad Justine and know that in this sorry world virtue is punished and vice rewarded. Nonetheless, our real reward is not here on this suffering Earth, therefore must we strive for goodness which is in heaven. (eerie chanting music)
