Don't .. don't let them. I am afraid. Nina, stop it. It's me, Bill. They can't get us now. They will kill us. - Nina. Get hold of yourself. Snap out of it. That same dream. Those frightening sadistic faces chasing me. Turning guns on me. There is nothing to worry about. They can't get us out here. You don't really believe that? You know we can't get away. They haven't caught us yet have they. No. But they will. Please, Bill. Let me give myself up. It isn't you they are after. They want me. Why don't you? This is why. We'll have to stop at the next gas station. Bill, I hate to stop for anything. We can't run without gas. I was just getting ready to close up. We're almost out of gas. Can't you fill it up? I suppose so. From California, huh? Yeah. Why? Oh, nothing. A lot of California cars pass through here. I wonder sometimes where they are heading. Why did he say that? Just to make conversation probably. I don't believe it. There must be some reason why he is so curious. Take it easy, Nina. We can't suspect everybody. That will be $3.22. [ Telephone ] Sit tight. I'll have your chance in a minute. Hello? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe they are. Okay. You had better get over here in a hurry. Hey, hey. What about your change? Maybe they are following us. No. They are not, sweet. Try to relax. I do wish I had a cigarette. Try the compartment. There might be some in there. Here. There is two left. [ Narration: ] "Why are these two running away?" "Bill Jones and Nina Petrovka." "What is this fear .." "Which has sent them racing along a lonely Arizona road?" "Have they murdered someone?" "Are the police pursuing them?" "Is it the Immigration Department or the FBI?" "Possibly it is none of these." "They could be running from something far more terrifying." "To understand, we must go back with Bill Jones." "Back on the wings of his tortured memory." "To his city in California." I am sorry but .. After you've paid your money down on a home lot there is nothing we can do. You meant the government won't act after I'm fleeced out of my last 2,500 bucks? We can't do anything. These real estate firms are not controlled by the government. We tried to warn the veterans but they are impatient. Sure, the veterans are always impatient. Always wrong. But why don't you change the way real estate outfits operate and advertize? So a guy don't end up with a scrubby lot on a hillside way of town. We are trying to. But Jones. You didn't consult us. You didn't even read the small print on your contract. That is what I've been hearing every place I go. So, I am just stuck. That's all there is to it, huh? No. No. We are investigating these housing projects but it takes time. And unfortunately there are other veterans in the same boat. Waiting for the same answer I got. The same old run-around. I'm going to tell other G.I.s the kind of a deal they'll get here. Let's not be having a disturbance, fellow. Move on. I can move on my own power. They kinda push you around, don't they. Who wants to know? Just another poor sap who's been given the same routine you have. They cut and dry it special for G.I.s up there. It makes me so hot I .. I'd like to paste somebody. Getting hot won't do any good but .. I know a nice place to cool off. Okay. I can stand plenty of cooling. Never noticed this place before. - Oh, it's not conspicuous. Just a sort of a club for discriminating people. How are you today, Mr Tyler? - Just fine, Bill. How is the bourbon situation? I may be able to rustle up a little Kentucky. That's the spirit. I'll take mine with water. The same. It looks like Tyler has got another prospect. Molly. Please, Henry. Don't make it more difficult. Uhuh. This one is on me. Got lucky today and hit a 2-horse parlay. Jack. Excuse me. Hi, Yvonne. How about bringing big and brawny over to the table? He is decidedly my type. I never saw one yet that wasn't your type. Never mind the personalities. I said I wanted to meet him. Sure. To jail with real estate agents. Life terms. Who's the criminal? Two more drinks and you'll be giving him the electric chair. Sure, if it isn't Molly O'Flaherty. Don't you love the way he kicks that Irish around. I don't believe I've met your friend, have I? I just me him myself. Try "Bill". He'll answer to that. Bill Jones. - Jones? The name is familiar. I've heard it or seen it somewhere. You must tit up nights reading phone books. Have a drink, Molly? - You've talked me into it. Better make that three doubles. We've got a lot of important drinking to do. Bill just got caught in the same deal that I did. Another pigeon who had his wings clipped. Not that G.I. housing project? A project without the housing. A funny thing about those G.I.s. You hear a lot about them. But you don't read of it in the papers. - They don't print that kind of stuff. It might frighten other suckers away. All this talk isn't going to help. When is somebody going to do something about it? Somebody is. They are? Who? Friends of mine. They had me watching that office. Checking on veterans who had complaints. We're getting a pretty good list. Well, you can count me in. It will stop other G.I.s from getting hurt. You are a good Joe, Bill. I'll speak to my friends about you. Okay. Just so you don't say anything bad that will come back to Molly. There is no reason why we should both drink solo. Why do you waste your time, Yvonne? You and I can sit together and still be solo. You know Henry, I wouldn't be surprised if you really wrote a great poem. Why the sudden confidence in my talent? They say a poet can only produce great art when his heart is really touched. And yours is being torn out and wiped on the floor. The bar room floor. Who is the girl you were going to build a little castle in the clouds for? Girl? Don't tell me you were going to live alone and try to like it? There was a girl when I built the house. She. She settled for something a little nearer the earth. Let's hope she lives unhappily ever after. Let's leave her out of this. I hate to break up this cheery little wake but I have got to meet Partridge. He is one of those friends I was telling you about. Go ahead. I'll try to get him up in the clouds again. Good. Look, Bill. Meet me here tomorrow. I'll tell you more about these friends of mine. I'll be around. So, I see whose type he is. I didn't even get a chance to talk to him. Molly moved right in. I wouldn't want to compete with Molly. And lose my amateur standing? Hi, Sam. How is it going? Been up all night working on a rewrite. What's the matter with Holder? Can't he give you a hand? He is not here anymore. - What happened? Mr Partridge been around? Yeah. He is in there. - Thanks, Sam. Come in. Hello, Mr Partridge. Come in. Sit down. Keep quiet. Continue. How can I compete with other papers if my best reporters disappear overnight? Holder was not only an ace newspaperman, he was a linguist. And he talked too much. About party matters in bars to his non-communist friends. We all do that. Then we will all get what Holder did. His Party card has been sent to the State Department. They will check it against his immigration papers. Then he'll be deported to his homeland. Where they know how to shut mouths. Permanently. Well, he'll be a hard man to replace. Ah, we can all be replaced. This paper. Could get a new editor within an hour's time. Even I, as the head of the committee. Could be replaced in no time at all. And you will be replaced. Unless you bring some recruits who are not hobos or stumblebums. That is what I wanted to talk to you about, Mr Partridge. I collared a good one today. Bill Jones. A hundred percent American type. Good war record. Plenty of gripes. He sounds alright. Does he know that he is not joining a tea party? I don't think we have to worry about that. If we promise him justice for the G.I.s, and .. Maybe a job for himself he'll go for it. Promise him anything. When we get him into the party he will find it is not so easy to get out. Pardon me. I say .. well .. Now that you are properly impressed. You can relax and you can have a good time. Remember, you only came up for one drink. I have got a very short memory. Except for pretty faces. You had better keep your mind on the drink, Mr J. You turn on the phonograph while I do the mixing. Okay. Well. - What is the matter? Who died and left you the fancy library? Sir, you are referring to the books I love. "The coming dawn". Kinda heavy going aren't they? At first, maybe. But you get to understand them if you stick at it. I always heard Commies peddled bunk. I didn't know they came as cute as you. And you're not going to be shocked and walk out? What is there to be shocked about? I just think it is funny. That's all. There's nothing so funny about it. Not if you stop to realize that .. The Party has been behind every decent cause in this country. The war against fascism and the labor movement. Look what it is doing today. Fighting for the minorities, the Jews and the negroes. I can't get steamed up over causes anymore. Except for the boy scouts. I still believe in Santa Claus. I never got to know much about Santa Claus. When I was a kid my Dad got starvation pay in a shop that wasn't organised. My mother broke her back over the stove and wash-tubs trying to make ends meet. You must have .. Come up on a fast elevator. I came up the hard way. Factory jobs and night school. And then I found out some of my friends were in the Party. They started helping me. Giving me a different slant on things. They showed me it wasn't me or my folks that were wrong. It was the system. I'll admit I don't understand all the ideology and some of the big words. But I do know what they are trying to do. To end once and for all the exploitation of humanity. The only cause of poverty and suffering. A pretty big speech for a little girl. But I mean it, Bill. Why do you think we are so interested in you? It can't be my money. It is because you lost your money in that housing deal. That is the kind of thing the party is fighting against. We are for people, not for privileges or property. Sounds good anyway. We are getting too serious. May I have this dance, Mr Jones? Sure. You didn't learn this in the boy scouts. Bill. Maybe you had better go home. Take this along. Read it. So. It has all been just a come-on for the Party. Don't say that, Bill. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - It's me, Molly. Hello, Ma. Pretty early for you to be out, isn't it? I guess so. I was here last night. But I heard you had company. So I went home. I thought you were going to stop drinking. Well, I didn't. Look, Ma. I'm not a kid anymore and you're not going to treat me like one. What's the matter, didn't you get your check? Yes, Molly. I got it. And I brought it back. Brought it back? Why? Isn't it big enough? I don't want that kind of money. You told me you were a secretary to a big stockbroker. You said that is why you could afford a place like this. And all those clothes and things. I suppose you've been listening to those Micks gossiping over at the church. And Father O'Leary. That is what I thought it was. Just gossip. It couldn't be true. Not about my Molly. And I decided to find out. For myself. So, you found out I am a communist. What is so wrong in that? There is no law against it. Well, if it isn't wrong why should you lie about it to your own mother? I don't even know what communism means. But it can't be good making you do these things. What things? What was the woman in the bible doing .. that was taken in sin? Look, Ma. I don't care anything about that bible junk. I am doing alright. And I belong to a party that is going to make the world over. Where people don't get the kind of a raw deal my father got. What raw deal? Your father worked hard and made a respectable home for us. He and I tried to bring you up the best we could. But it's beginning to look like we didn't do a very good job of it. What is the use? You don't understand. I guess I don't. The only thing I can do is keep on praying. "Protest meeting. G.I.'s attention." "The Hillside Veteran's Housing Project .." "Is defrauding ex-servicemen by selling them 'City' lots .." "Which have no public utilities or building prospects." "Demand action from your District Attorney's office .." "Your City council and the Grand Jury." "G.I.'s Protest." That is the idea. That ought to stir them up. You know it's a shame about those poor boys, the defenders of our country. Stripped of their pension and their life savings. That sounds like one of my editorials. Well, I'd better be on my way. Oh. You will have to wait for Nina. She is in charge of the picketing. She and Yvonne. Women in charge of a demonstration like that? There might be some rough stuff. Fist fights. A few broken heads. I'm afraid that you've forgotten Nina's background. She was a communist in Europe. Years ago. And she knows strategy and tactics. Thanks for the kind words. - Hello, Nina. Hi, Nina. How are you today, Miss Nina? - Fine, Sam. Very good. I have arranged to have some students and professors in the crowd. And I am going to have a flock of G.I.s there. Spearheaded by some of our top recruits, like Bill Jones. He is still playing along? Getting more steamed up every day. He's so sore at the housing project and the government, he'd swallow anything. Good. Nina, you might give him a little special attention. Alright, Earl. Let's get on. "The introduction of Bill Jones to communist strategy." "A misguided young man." "Fallen under the spell of Marxian hatred and revenge." "Unaware that he is only the tool of men who would destroy his country." "The signs didn't tell of the worldwide Marxist racket." "Intent on spreading dissension and treason." Give these to the G.I.s over there. Here you are, Jack. - Right. There he is! That's the guy that got our money. Okay boys. Let's see some action. Show 'em what we're here for! Let 'em see we mean business. They can't steal our money and get away with it. We ought to rush the place. Let's break up the joint. Let's pull down them signs. Come on, tear down the place. Break it down. Go on, throw that brick. Break it. Stick up for our rights and our money. Fight for your rights, boys. Fight. Get rid of these. - Huh? Take my arm and start walking. Okay. Come on. Let's go. Alright, break it up now. Clear the site. This is meant to be a free country. It wouldn't be if your kind had their way. Come on, let's go. Buy the tickets, darling. I don't mind being taken for a ride, but why pick me out? You seemed to be in such a daze back there. I had to do something. What did I do wrong? You are a novice, aren't you. You're fortunate you weren't arrested. I guess you wonder who I am. You didn't give me time to wonder. I am Nina Petrovka. Glad to know you. I am .. - I know. You're Bill Jones. Partridge told me to keep an eye on you. I didn't think I needed a bodyguard. You didn't think so? Look. Some of them might be on their way to jail. I don't exactly like the idea of running out on those guys. Very noble Mr Jones, but not very practical. We all have a job to do and you can't very well do it in jail. One of the first things you learn. You make feel like a kid talking to schoolmarm. Well, I am a schoolteacher. Only not the usual kind. I am one of the instructors for the party. You mean the party runs regular schools? - That's right. They want the recruits to learn the ropes from old hands like me. I practically grew up in the party. Well, if you grew up that way I can understand you being a communist. But .. You are not very sure about Bill Jones? Just suppose I should ask you what communism means. Well. The idea of .. everybody sharing things equally, isn't it? That is the average American opinion. You had better get to me classes and get your eyes opened. What if a student asks for a date with the teacher? Take that up after you are a student. Goodnight. Just like that? The ride is over, Mr Jones. Well, that's no way to coax pupils into the party. Remember, I am not Molly. The Party is getting rough. Charlie. All communist doctrine is founded on the teachings of Karl Marx .. As embodied in his book Das Kapital. And his later works and pamphlets. The basis of his doctrine. "Two nights later at the opening of class at the Workers School." "Finds Bill Jones and other party recruits studying Marxism." "Its principles, strategy and tactics." "Nina Petrovka." "Chosen for the introductory lecture because of her charm and personality." "Explains the basis of communism." "It teaches that man and his world are the product of natural forces." "That are constantly changing." "There are no positive values." "No eternal principles of right and wrong." "Actually, it is the old doctrine of atheism." "Sugar-coated with highbrow terms." "It says that men are not responsible to anyone." "Except the totalitarian socialist state." "Marx. Engels. Lenin." "Stalin." "The apostles of the communist gospel." "These are the words of the foremost living communist." "Joseph Stalin." "And yet the American communists deny .." "That they want to overthrow our government by force." Fellow workers. I am going to ask you a very important question. What is democracy? "As the class advances other lecturers pound home communist doctrines." "Partridge sneers at democracy as a delusion created by Christianity." "He sings the old Marxian song that religion is a narcotic." "Devised to make the workers endure their chains." "But Bill and the other students are not told .." "That in the true communist state." "All form of disagreement is forbidden." "That the freedom which they are offering to the workers." "Would immediately be suppressed." Tonight, we shall begin our discussion of strategy and tactics. Let us be frank, comrades. All around us we see the bourgeois institutions .. Which are devised to exploit the workers. And enrich the capitalistic exploiters. These institutions. Of the dollar-dominated press and radio. The fascistic churches. The red-baiting senators and congressmen. The befuddled and outdated American laws that stifle progress. Nothing must stand in the way of the onward march of democracy. You have another one of your questions, comrade Reachi? Yeah. Just what do you mean by democracy, Miss Kraus? We mean rule by the people. What else? Rule by all of the people? Of course. Well then .. What do our .. Textbooks mean by .. Dictatorship of the proletariat? Dictatorship by one class ain't .. Ain't democracy. Those things would all be clear to anyone with a proper attitude. But the truth don't change according to somebody's attitude. There is only one kind of truth. That is the communist party truth as seen by Marx, Lenin and Stalin. But they want to .. they want to overthrow all governments. Even the American government. By force and violence. Then we will overthrow it by force and violence. We'll have our way if it means bloodshed and terror. If we have to liquidate a million milksops like you. My friends. Is this the kind of democracy you want? Is this the kind of world .. - He is worse than a fascist. He is a Mussolini-spawned Dago. Who wants to grovel at the feet of the exploited of his own people. A Dago, huh? And you are the people who preach tolerance. Peaceful progress. Respect for civil liberties. I say this is the greatest fraud ever perpetrated in a democratic country. Hey. Hey, what's the matter with you guys? Don't you recognise a lot of phonies when you hear them? Yeah. Sure. It would be too bad if you had to shoot your mouth off about this. Well I am going to tell them just what I found out. Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute, you guys. "Is it getting to be too much even for you, Nina?" "After all those years in the party?" "You knew about the communist goon squads who take care of the Reachis." "The little men who dared to raise their voices." "These are the people who rant about the injustices of capitalist democracy." What is the matter with you? A weak stomach? Or is it your loyalty? Hello Earl. This is Nina. I don't think I will be able to make it for the meeting tonight. Why not? We are counting on you as usual. Oh, well. Take this night off then and get some rest. Alright, Nina. Nina is sick. She has been working pretty hard lately. I hope it is nothing serious. It might be more serious than you think. I am beginning to wonder about Nina. Good evening. Right this way please. This is a nice little place. Do you come here often? When I want to get away from party members. I like to do that sometimes. - Sort-of playing hooky. I know. The food and wine are very good in here. Pot-au-feu. You take what you get. It is what you call "grabbing a bag". A grab-bag. Comment ça va, madame? - Tres biens, Merci. Monsieur. Madame. [ Violin music ] Who is the guy the song brings back? It wasn't a song. It wasn't a guy. I was just thinking. Are you worried about something, Nina? Why? That distant look in your eye. How is it up there on cloud 7? It is lonesome. I guess I should stay down on terra firma. You know, this is kind-of an anniversary. You took me up in the clouds three months ago today. Very sweet. Don't tell me kept track of it. Yep. Only I wasn't going to mention it. I was afraid it might sound foolish. Why should it? A woman likes to hear foolish things like that. See how wrong a guy can be? I thought you were only a cold-hearted schoolteacher. But you have got real flesh and blood just like anybody else. Yes. In the part of Europe I come from women learn to be natural. They say what they think and feel. I don't have to tell you how I feel. It has been talked about. They say that .. You joined the Party because of how you feel about me. Can I still feel that way if I don't join the Party? You mean you don't believe in it? Some of their ideas might be alright. I can't say I approve of the methods they use to put them across. This Reachi thing for instance. I wouldn't talk about Reachi, Bill. As to their methods. My father didn't like them either. Even though he was a Party leader. Is he still over there? He was shot by the communists. I am sorry, Nina. Yvonne. What are you doing here? Just looking around. A wonderful atmosphere, isn't it. For curing a sick headache. Or whatever ails you. You know darling, you should be careful what you say. Others might hear you and not understand what a loyal party member you are. Other people might not be eavesdropping. Of course they might make an exception in your case. You and Molly are so gifted at wooing men. Into the Party. They tell me Mr Partridge is here. He is in the office. Mr Solomon is waiting to see him. More of your epic poetry for our next issue I suppose. Well, I wouldn't call it epic but at least it is honest. Honest, safe and sane. It's about as revolutionary as a tabby cat. She won't be satisfied until they start printing the paper in red ink. Do you know why Nina missed that meeting? She wasn't sick. She had a date with Bill Jones. Oh, well. We can't object to a little romance now and then. In fact I'd recommend it for some other Party members. It might calm them down a little. You can worry about my emotions if you want to. But at least you don't have to worry about my Party loyalty. That's more than I can say for Nina. That's a serious charge, Yvonne. - It was meant to be. No wonder she can't stand seeing that disloyal ingrate Reachi being beaten. She was defending her traitor father to Bill Jones. Would you like me to .. Have the boys keep an eye on her? - It certainly wouldn't hurt. Nina wouldn't be the first foreign communist .. Who came over here and got a crush on Uncle Sam. I can't believe that. Not about Nina. She's been a party member since she was a child. However if she develops any American loyalties .. Her card can be sent to the State Department and she'll be deported. Nina has personal experience of how the Party over there deals with traitors. People like Nina forget that sometimes. But I'll be very happy to remind her. [ Door knocks ] Hello, Henry. How did they like the poem? Oh. Fair, I guess. Beautiful roses. Yes. They are lovely. I don't know who sent them. I hope you are not going to be jealous again. I guess I do get kind-of possessive at times. But there are things I believe in as theories that need work and I have .. We've been through all that, dear. I've told you I can't believe one way and act another. You are just a little kid that doesn't know what she believes in. Incidentally. I am the admirer who sent those roses. You did? Oh darling, that was sweet of you. [ Door knocks ] Hello, Father. - Hello, Molly. I was in the neighborhood seeing the Mulcahys so I thought I would drop by. I am glad you did. Won't you come in? I am sorry. I didn't know you had company. That is alright. Father O'Leary, this is Henry Solomon. How are you, lad? I am glad to know you. - How do you do. Mr Solomon is a friend of mine. If you came for the reason I think I'd as soon have him here for this sermon. Confidentially, sermons bore me. Even my own. Well, sit down, children. Sit down. You don't have to stand on ceremony with me. Would you care for a cigarette, Father? Or a drink, then? I will settle for cigarettes. I could stand a little nip but it wouldn't be cricket. I have just made Mr Mulcahy sign the pledge. Poor Mrs Mulcahy. She has her problems. Six children and a drinking husband. If it weren't for Father O'Leary and my mother I don't know how they would live. Drinking is caused by frustration and that can't be cured by charity. The whole system has to be changed. Sure, lad. But what are the children supposed to eat while you are doing the changing? Or should I say, waiting for the revolution? Revolution. What does he know about a revolution, Molly? There is no sense in even discussing it. That's right. You might as well get to the point of your visit, Father. My mother sent you here to talk me out of being a communist. But I happen to be of age and I will think the way I please. Without the advice of a biased mother or a Father of an outworn medieval church. My, my. This sounds like a worse case than Mulcahy's. It could be settled I suppose by another pledge. A loyalty pledge. That might help. If you folks really understood what you are pledging yourselves to. I thought we weren't going to have any sermons, Father. We are not. We are going to let money talk. Have you got half a dollar, lad? Half a dollar? - Yes. Yeah. I think so. Thank you. You see what it says on this side of the coin? "E Pluribus Unum". And if you remember your school-day Latin you'll know what it means. One out of many. That is the genius of America. We are not Irish or English or Jewish or Russian. We're all of them. We've taken the best they had and forged them into a common bond. The old melting-pot idea. Right. But how does that solve the problems of today? Because the melting-pot is still working. We still absorb anything that is good from other peoples. That is where we are different. The communists say they have all the answers. They sound like Mulcahy talking through his beer. Now, you see what it says on the other side? "In God we trust." God isn't very popular in some circles today. Just as he wasn't .. In a lot of countries and systems that are forgotten and buried. I should that all depends on what you mean by God? God is the Being. That puts something in here. That makes you want a better world. The atheistic systems are always founded on hatred. Race hatred when they are Nazis. Class hatred when they are communistic. There is an old saying. That the dice of God are always loaded. Sure they are. They are loaded on the side of the people who trust in him. Here is your coin, lad. Maybe I had better put this in the poor box. Thanks a lot. Charity covers a multitude of ideologies. As you all probably know. This meeting was called by the National Committee. One of the important duties of the Party committee. Is to study and direct .. The works of communist writers, scientists and musicians. And to see that their efforts do not deviate from the approved Party line. One of the members of this group. Has been accused of such deviation. Henry Solomon's poem, written in honor of Karl Marx. Has been found objectionable. That poem was submitted months ago. Why should the committee suddenly find it out of line? Are you pitting your puny mind up against the committee's? I just wonder if it was the committee that found that poem objectionable. Or whether that decision came from some higher body outside of this country. Henry. Why don't you let Mr Partridge continue so we can hear what the objection is? In your poem you spoke of Marx .. "Making the ancient dream of paradise breathe on earth". About "opening graves where liberty sleeps". "And all ghosts spring forth". These praises would indicate that Marx merely carried on the work of other men. Instead of originating his own doctrine. This is ridiculous. Every student knows that Marx developed the ideas of Hegel. And his ideas went way back to Democritus in ancient Greece. You see, he is a deviationist. I knew it all along. Are you conducting this meeting, Yvonne? Do you mean to tell me that just because I am a communist .. I have to deny the facts of biography and history? You must follow the communist conception of history, Mr Solomon. We contend that Karl Marx had no basis in Hegel or Democritus or anybody else. I heard of things like this being put over in communist-dominated countries. Philosophers being compelled to deny the facts they uncovered. Musicians forced to compose the kind of music that ignorant commissars demanded. And poets and journalists denied the freedom of expression. But I never thought I would find injustice like this in America. Solomon. There is just one issue here. Will you or will you not .. Publicly retract the opinions you expressed in this poem? I'd rather say that the issue is whether I, as an American citizen .. As well as a communist have the right to freedom of expression and opinion. Henry, you should know better than that. What you call "freedom" is licensed. The license to put your own will against the Party line. In all my years in the Party I thought that I could be an American democrat .. And a communist at the same time. That if it came to an issue some of the teachings of Marx might be abandoned. I see now I was wrong. Under the circumstances. I find no alternative but to withdraw from the party. Now that I am no longer fettered by a dictatorship. I can tell you trained red seals a few of the things that have been on my mind. You shout about progress and reforms and lure young progressives into the party. Yet behind their backs in your council meetings you sneer at them .. As weak-minded simpletons for being stupid enough to join. I found this committee to be made up chiefly of psychopathic misfits .. Who are seeking an outlet for their frustrations and failures. Only people like that could accept the party line with its corkscrew tactics. And its grandstand play to ex-G.I.s. And its lies about the government that is trying to help solve their problems. You crusade for liberalism. The only liberalism you know is in the purse strings of the communist party. It pours money into the pockets of men .. Who haven't the brains or sincerity to hold a decent job. You pretend to fight racial discrimination. But you keep reminding me that I am a Jewish-American. That Sam down in the office is a negro-American. That Molly over here is an Irish-American. We are none of us hyphens. We are just plain Americans. Go on, sneer at me. Tell me I'm waving a flag. Alright. At least that flag has three colors in it and not one. Not one bloody one. Traitor. Trotskyite. If I had my way I'd .. The committee will deal with him, Yvonne. No-one places themselves beyond the pale of party discipline .. Merely by tearing up their card. I think you all understand that .. None of you can associate with him until we have instructions from the committee. The meeting is adjourned. I am sorry this had to happen in front of one of your students, Nina. But at least we are beginning to find out who the loyal members are. Come on, Bill. Let's go. Okay. What are we going to do about Molly? Well, I'll have to talk to her tomorrow and tell her what she can expect .. If she associates with Solomon. "Over next few weeks Solomon learns what it means to be boycotted by the Party." "And shunned by its membership." "Outcast. Pariah. Taboo." "He has begun to suffer the real meaning of those dismal words." "The walls are crowding in on him." "The suffocating boredom of the drab apartment makes him irritable." "Restless." "He must get out. Go somewhere.." "Anywhere." "For hours he walks the streets." "Searching for the friendly face of someone he knows." "Someone he can talk to and ease his troubled mind." "Students from the Workers School .." "Who once greeted him as an oracle of the Party." "Now are deliberately obvious in their efforts to avoid speaking to him." "He knows what they are saying." "The cynical gossip as they sneer after him." "Solomon, the libertine." "Solomon the drunkard." "Solomon diseased." "Solomon, the traitor." "Boycotted by the newspapers because of his subversive past." "Solomon is compelled to take any job that's offered." "Filing clerk. Stenographer." "But one after another he loses those jobs." "And always for the same reason." "The boss wants to see Solomon." "He has been expecting it every hour." "At first the office manager ad been pleasant." "Because of Solomon's intelligence and conscientious work." "Now, he acts like a different man." "As though Solomon were his enemy." "It hounds him wherever he goes." "Sent by men who never forgive." "Or forget." "Wearily, he tries to tell he has left the Party." "Of his own accord." "But like the other bosses, the manager is sorry." "That it is against the policy of the firm." "To employ people who mix in alien movements." "Against the United States Government." "Back to the hopeless round of the lonely streets." "Trying to stop the racing thoughts of a disintegrating mind." "Back to the pounding thoughts of Molly." "Whom he must continue to avoid for her own welfare." Henry. Hello Molly. I got to be going. - Oh, you can't go, Henry. I have been looking for you every place. I've phoned and left messages. Yes, I know. I have been busy. No you haven't. You are just going to pieces. Darling, you look terrible. I'll be alright. Molly, you shouldn't be seen speaking to me. You don't know the things they can do. I don't care what they do. I'm through with them. I thought I was too. It is not so easy. Goodbye, Molly. Take care of yourself. Oh Henry. Wait a minute. Hello Sam. Hi. Where is Partridge? He is in there. Waiting for Mr Vejac. I don't want to get you in trouble by talking to you, Sam. But there is a favor you might do me for old times' sake. Well, if I can .. I may be going away suddenly. If I do. I'd appreciate it if you would deliver this note. Come in. What do you want? Mr Partridge. I want to talk to you about this. It is one thing ostracise me. Alright. We have ideological differences. But. Molly? Molly isn't hurting anybody. She has been seen fraternizing with Party renegades. That is nonsense. She was just taking to me for a moment in a doorway. I am not interested in the cheap amours of a common party girl. Suppose if I answered that the way I should? It might mean more trouble for Molly. Very likely. There is just one favor that you could do for her. If you were inclined to be self-reliant. Then stop bothering her. Once and for all. Get out of her life. Get out of everybody's lives. Is he dead? Is something wrong? That crazy fool Solomon just jumped out the window. How did it happen? Well, I was talking to him and he jumped. I had better tell them over at Party headquarters. And see how they want to break it. I .. I can't tell you how sorry I am, Miss O'Flaherty. He was always so kind to me. Such a good friend. How are you, child? Glad to see you here. Hello, Father. Father, I .. I am sorry for the way I have lived. But I am not sorry I loved Henry. You don't have to be sorry about that, child. He was a sincere man. A good man. The church doesn't condone suicide. But it realizes that sometimes when people take their lives. They are irresponsible. Temporarily insane. The people in the Party just hounded him to his death. You mustn't be bitter against them, Molly. They are misguided. They need our prayers. The best way. To defeat communism. Is for us to embrace Christianity in American democracy .. Every day of our lives. I know, Father. I am .. I am glad I've come home. Molly. Molly. Did you check everything? She didn't take anything but her own things. She has moved out alright. Yvonne, you move in here. And let this be a reminder to you all about how quickly you can be replaced. Nina. You have been very quiet. I hope you won't be sick again. - No. I have just been thinking of some work I should be doing for the council. Perhaps you had better get busy on it. She is still acting up. More so all the time. Listen, Earl. I was right about Solomon and Molly, and I'm right about her. I say you should do something about it. - I am going to. Have her watched from now on. Hello, Sam. - Hiya, Bill. Has Nina been here? - No. I haven't seen her today. Sam. There is .. Something has been bothering me. I'd like to ask you about it. What's that? About Solomon. Don't you think he got sort-of a raw deal? Well. We are not supposed to look at it that way. To bring about the revolution. Some people do have to suffer. But it is what happens to the masses that counts. Yeah, I know. I've been trying to tell myself that. But it is hard to swallow. Oh. Hello, Mr Vejac. They want to see you over at Party headquarters, Jones. Okay. So long, Sam. - See you, Bill. Headquarters wants us to give Solomon the works. How are you coming on your article about him? Well, I am having trouble. Is that all you have written? Look. Couldn't somebody else handle this? Solomon was always pretty fine to me. What are you doing, getting sentimental? You know what the Party is doing for your race. And Solomon was a traitor to the Party. Well, I will do the best I can. Hello, Dad. Hello, Sam. Busy? A little. Come on in. Just on my way home and dropped by to see you was getting along. Same as usual. Got something on your mind, Dad? Anything wrong at home? It is what's wrong here, son. There is nothing wrong here. I'd say a man's suicide was something wrong. You know it. Especially because he was a friend of yours. Solomon, you mean? Those things happen. Yeah. And how come they happen? That's what I wants to know. And how come your paper used to say such nice things about Mr Solomon .. And then suddenly switch? It seems like they couldn't think of anything nasty enough to say. Maybe he deserved what they said. Sam Wright, what has got into you? You used to cut out Mr Solomon's poems and show them to Ma and me. And say how glad you was to be working with him. Well. Things. Things are different now. The hardest change is minding the Party. And I .. I have to think the way the Party does. Then it is a pretty poor Party. That's all I got to say. I'm beginning to believe some of the things I've been hearing about it. What kind of things? Deacon Smith was talking about your communism in church the other night. He said it's just using the colored people just like it's using the G.I.s. And other folks. Just to stir up trouble. Maybe Deacon Smith should stick to his preaching. Look here, Sam. Don't you go upstaging me and my friends. Deacon Smith has read a few books too. I am sorry, Dad. I didn't mean any offence. Deacon Smith said slavery ended in the United States more than 80 years ago. And right today. There's more slaves in communist countries than there are .. Any place or anywhere. And what you tell me. About a man having to think as the party dictates. It looks like we're having slaves here again. Come on. Chuck it all, Sam and come on home with me. That is what Solomon said in his note to Molly. Come on, Dad. Let's go home. Sam. Sam? We're wasting our time on those African ingrates. Who is it? - Me. Bill. It's a little I guess but I've got some news. Come in, Bill. I saw Partridge tonight. He said for me to drop in at headquarters tomorrow .. And I'll be issued a Party card. A Party card? Yes. What's the matter, Nina? What's come over you? It must be something about the Party. You have been trying to get me in, haven't you? I have been trying. It was Tyler and Partridge and Yvonne. They handed me over to you. You led me to your lectures. Took me to meetings. Showed me around. I have been trying to show you what communism really is. Hoping you would leave it alone. Instead you are accepting it. Not completely. I told you that. Maybe I wanted to be whatever you were. To think the way you did. I don't know what to say. I came here to fight for the people's rights. But then I found that the people here have everything communism promises. If ever it seizes power. Well, they can't seize power here too easily. Not with only a few thousand members. But that is what they want you to think. In every country communism has conquered the party membership was small. That's what they want. A small and highly-disciplined group of fanatics. Backed by thousands of fellow travellers. You should know if anybody does. Only I wish you had told me all this before. I was afraid to, Bill. When I signed my immigration papers. I denied that I was a communist. And if you try to leave the party they will tell the State Department. And have you deported. I've got so that I don't care about that anymore. But I care about you. And I know what would happen if you will take that card. And I don't want it cards to happen to you, Bill. Darling, we have got to get away from here. I couldn't get away from here, Bill. Let me show you. They're suspicious of me already because I wasn't bitter enough against Solomon. Because they sense how I feel about you. Look, Nina. We can go out the back way. You have got a car and we have a few dollars between us. But don't you realize they will be after us wherever we go? The party informers, the goon squads. Listen. I know this country. We can head for New Mexico. Texas. We'll find some little place way off the beaten track. Bill, it is like learning to hope again. Hurry, Nina. Pack some clothes. He ought to be coming out pretty soon. Maybe he is staying. Not with her, he ain't. Hurry Nina. Let's go. Okay. Nina, don't. Hey. See that? Let's take a look around the back. Wait a minute. - Hello Miss Petrovka. Going somewhere? For a ride, maybe. You don't need a suitcase for that. We're taking you two to see Partridge. You're not taking us anywhere. You will bring in the bag? - Yes, ma'am. We're from the immigration department, Miss Kraus. We want to have a talk with you down at headquarters. Where's your warrant? An immigration inspector doesn't need a warrant. What is this, more Gestapo methods? Where are our civil liberties? Let me go. Do you hear me. Let me go. I am American. Listen. I'm an American citizen. You will pay for this. - Come on. Where were you born, Miss Kraus? I refuse to answer this Gestapo. I am an American citizen. That is what we have to determine. If everything is in order we'll let you go with an apology. I have nothing to be afraid of. I was born in New York City. When? May 4th 1920. Your father's name? - Friedrich Kraus. Where was he born? Hamburg, Germany. He was naturalised. You took a trip to Mexico ten years ago, Miss Kraus. How long did you stay? Three months. It all seems to check with our records. Now, just sign this statement, Miss Kraus. Sure. Why not. Now, we'll just check this with the old files. This doesn't check. What? What doesn't? The signature you just gave me is in a different handwriting .. To the signature of Ann Kraus on her passport application. But it does check with the handwriting of one Greta Bloch. That is a lie! I'm being framed. I know my rights. I demand a lawyer. Tale it easy. You will get a lawyer. We've taken a lot of abuse from you. So suppose you listen for a change. We've been watching you not only because of your communist activities. But because of your loudmouthed disloyalty to the U.S. Government. While Inspector Riggs kept you under surveillance. We made an exhaustive check. We found out the real Yvonne Kraus did go to Mexico in 1938. To open a pottery business. Then we lost track of her. And so did the Mexican authorities. But the Comintern acquired her passport and doctored it to fit Greta Bloch. With your picture and your signature. That is how you came into the United States. Besides that, you made a mistake here. A mistake that any German might make. It was the pronunciation you gave to the names "Friedrich" and "Hamburg". The real Yvonne Kraus. Never spoke a word of German in her life. You are too late. You are too late I tell you! You don't know it. But the revolution is here! You are talking to Commissar Bloch, you fools. You thought you could arrest me. Me, Commissar Bloch. Yes, Yvonne Kraus disappeared. Because she was murdered. But you can't touch the men who killed her. [ Military marching music ] Listen. Hear them. Hear their drums. The Red Legions. They are entering the city. In a few minutes they will be here. And then we'll stand you against a wall. Hear them. I knew. I knew they would be here. I knew they would come! They will be here to take charge. To take your jobs. Commissar Partridge and Commissar Tyler. They killed Yvonne Kraus in Mexico. They did it on my orders. Try and arrest them now. [ Military marching music ] Don't you hear them? You fools! Don't you hear them? Alright, Norton. Psychopathic ward. Well, that is that. I only wanted her statement for clarification. We have files of evidence tying Partridge and Tyler .. Into the murder of the original Yvonne Kraus. Good. Benson and Schultz were pulled in for the murder of young Reachi. Their confessions also implicate Partridge and Tyler. You'd better bring them in. While I go into the case of Nina Petrovka. "So now we understand what Bill and Nina are fleeing." "Why their objective is an obscure hideaway." "Halfway across the wide and sprawling continent." What's the name of this burgh? Talbot. But don't ask me where it is. Well, it's in Texas. We know that much. Bill. Why are we stopping? I've been thinking, Nina. What are we running away from? This is the United States. Not a police state. Let's go and see that Sheriff. Have a talk with him. Try to make him understand. Alright, Bill. Whatever you want. Howdy. What can I do for you? - We would .. We would like to come in and talk to you. Sure. Come in here. Have a seat. Okay? Shoot. We want to give ourselves up, Sheriff. But first, I would like to explain. Technically we might be guilty but actually we are not. We never was .. Nina tried to break with them. They want her and have tipped off the authorities. Hey, back up a minute. Everything you have said so far is about as clear as a mudhole. Now, first off. What are your names? I am .. Bill Jones and .. this is Nina Petrovka. Glad to know you. You look sort-of tired and troubled. Now, suppose you start telling what this is all about and .. Go far enough back so as I can understand it. And .. take your time. You know, there is lots of things we ain't got here in Talbot. Time ain't one of them. Well Sheriff, I .. I guess I had better tell you what happened back in California. So. When we got here we decided to give ourselves up. And see what the law had to say. Do you know what? You folks have been running away from yourselves. From the fear in your own minds. You have been messing around so long with .. The intrigues and underhanded methods of the communists, that .. You've begun to think everybody acts the same as they do. You are no more wanted by the authorities than I am. But you don't know how they operate. They must have tipped off the State Department. Supposing they did. The Federal government won't take any action until they make an investigation. And when they investigate they'll find out how things are. You know, I read a lot of books. I have to, to keep up with things. From what I understand, the communists don't give nobody a second chance. Now that is where the United States is different. We give folks just as many chances as they deserve. Suppose this young lady of yours .. Did perjure herself to the government a few years back. She wouldn't today. Why, right now she is probably a better citizen than lots of us. As she knows the meaning of something that .. Bill Jones was trying to throw away. I guess you got yourself a little confused, eh Bill? Not too confused to pick yourself one of the swellest lookers I've seen in Texas. That means I am talking about the prettiest girls in the world. Well, I don't mean to run out on you kids, but .. I got to drive over to the next county and pick up Mike Tolliver. What did Mr Tolliver do? He got himself drunk. They gave him thirty days. The judge agreed to let him spend it in my jail. Kinda funny laws you have around here. Well, Mike has been shooting off his mouth that .. He can beat me at checkers. So we are going to find out. What you two want to do is get yourselves hitched. And raise a couple of real American kids. And if you ever need a witness. I'll vouch for you. So long. So long. There is a great guy. Bill, we don't even know his name. Hey, sonny. What is the name of that Sheriff? 0h him? It's some kind of a long name. But us kids, we call him Uncle Sam. Well. You heard what Uncle Sam said about .. getting hitched. And raising some real American kids. All in favor, say "I". I .. I .. I. I. "My country, 'tis of thee." "Sweet land of liberty." "Of thee I sing." "Land where my fathers died." "Land of the pilgrims' pride." "From every mountainside." "Let ... freedom ... ring." -(tg)-
