They're early this year. I want to talk to you. There's nothing more to talk about. You two look funny! What are you doing in the garden? You'll catch cold out there! I'll be up soon. Have you told them? I told Lena. - Didn't upset them? - They're happy about it. Nice that Dad didn't have to experience this. You can't get sentimental about a house like this. You team up with Nils, to try and realise the dream of your youth... It was to be nothing less than an architectural wonder. That you can't support your wife and children... is a trifle for a genius like you. You really are nasty! You mean it's right that I'd work day after day, year after year, on work that I despise... ...and all you say is I barely support you? Plenty of others would be satisfied. No, I'll do that! I'll never give it up, if that's what you're hoping. A man has to believe in what he's doing.. What's the point of living, otherwise? If I say "for your family", me and your children... you think I'm just a stupid woman... ...without any ideals or views. If I don't have respect for myself and my work... I'm not worth anything to you. So it IS better we divorce. Only time will tell. So I guess you'd go to your mother's with the children? She HAS suggested it. It would be crowded, but her boarders could move out. Would YOU talk to him... They been heard from? Heard from? You know what workmen are like. Promise you a time, but keep to it? The usual! See how it looks... Looks a bit the worse for wear. But I have to get it up today. Yes, I know people think I'm a bit strange. Raising a flag for the day she died. It's as if it's something ungodly. But our life together was one long celebration. Shouldn't that be commemorated, even if it's 16 years since she passed away? Of course. I hope you get it fixed. If you'll excuse me, I'm running a bit late for work. Yes of course.. It's a bit chilly as well.. It's not the usual spring. Lena! Hi, Daddy! Hey, you should be buttoned up... You need to keep as warm as possible Lena, hurry straight home from school. Gerda's free, so you can look after Bjorn. I feel confident I can rely on you. We're not at all good friends when Mum is always nagging. I'm sure you are. Are you going away? Yes. Will you be away long? I think so. Hurry up, we'll have some fun together. That's Kaisa. 'Bye! If a trial was conducted in the criminal's nursery... ...then no verdict would be handed down. Hello, Mum. Goodness, it's you... Are you here to see me? I thought I'd take a look at the rooms. So he hasn't come to his senses? Nils has offered him a job. He's moving out today. A regular job? Who will live in those houses? Nils is a skilled architect who doesn't compromise. Well... it's lucky that there's one in the family... ...with good judgment and a sense of responsibility. You'll see... So long as Pilsjo moves out, you'd be happy in the two-bedroom flat... You and the kids. Go and have a look around. He'll be there. He'll let you in. Don't forget to switch the lights off, please. Mum! Do you really need to dress in mourning? It was over a year ago. I still mourn for her. HOMEOPATHIST Oh, Mrs Rocke? I thought... Your mother's out. I know, I met her on the stairs. Come in. Actually, I shouldn't still be here. What do you mean? I'm behind with the rent. After that scandal last autumn... ...patients are few and far between. They call me a quack. "Nothing but a quack!"! You don't think so, do you? You know that I cured. Is it important what I might think? You, or anyone else. Someone has to believe in me... that I'm honourable. I've no doubt at all that you're honourable. Your mother's migraine is almost gone, yet she still wants to kick me out. No... Yeah. I could tell by the way she asked if I'd had any patients. Mum needs to get the rent so she can afford to live here. The interest wouldn't be enough. She's need to take from the capital. That's right. The interest wouldn't be enough. The 6 goes on the 7, Mum. I can see that, Birgit my pet. Would you hand me my bag? I've got a hankie there. But Gorel...! Look, Mummy. A real castle! It's lovely. We must show Grandma. Look, Grandma! That's lovely. Where have you been? In the kitchen with Dagmar and Karin. Dagmar helped me cut it out. It's not suitable for you to be hanging around the kitchen. Soon you'll have your own playroom at Grandma's. You can bring your bed and dolls' house here. I'll buy curtains and a table. I don't want to live with Grandma! I want to live with Mummy and Daddy! But Mummy will live here too. We're so pleased that Grandma wants us to be here. Then we have somewhere to go. Would you go and bring me the thing on the sewing table in Grandma's room. Oh... we'll have it in the drawing room. When you pick up the opera tickets, Karin, there should only be 4... not 6. - But Mum, what for? - You know what Vilma's like. The premiere's on Friday the 13th, so she's scared silly. Karl missed seeing Gosta Ekman. He didn't get to see 'Hamlet' either. And now he won't see 'Peer Gynt'. When Vilma got something in... Would you answer that, Karin. Hello, yes? Just a moment. For Mrs Karpell. - Was it Mr Karpell? - Yes. I shall talk to him. - But Mum...! - It's best this way. Shall I bring Gorel's chocolate? No, not just now. Grandma promised! Would you mind taking her with you, when you pick up the tickets? Don't get excited... There's only one going up. You could buy yourself a paper, instead of freeloading. Can't a man even stand on a public street?! Listen to him! How would there be room for anyone to walk, if everyone was like him?! – Rubbish! – Dirty old man! NORWEGIAN LANDSLIDE INTO FJORD. TIDAL WAVE CLAIMS 50 LIVES. Can you imagine! 50 dead, and some were small children! The survivors were divided into five teams. One team had to look for bodies. Nice sort of job to have to do! Horrible! - Going somewhere, Miss? - Yes, on an errand. Are you free this evening, Miss? Miss? Karin's my name, as if you didn't know. You can call me Axel. I'll be free after the visitors have gone. That's a bummer. I'd thought we could go to the cinema and see 'The Dancing Venus'. And maybe shake a leg at Sveasalen. Look at the balloons! Must you drag that kid around? Naughty girl! Behave yourself in public! Can't she run on ahead? I wouldn't dare do that. Hey... Here's a quarter... Go and buy yourself a balloon. - We'll walk around the corner. - Hurry back! Don't push! I can fall in! Are you a scaredy-cat?! YOU are scaredy-cats who don't dare come here! Let's have fun with her. Oh, what a lovely balloon you have! I'll keep it! Let's burst it instead. We shall burst the balloon! We shall burst the balloon! Help! I'm gonna tell your dad on you! Let's get out of here! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Can't you WALK to land? Now I'll get pneumonia and die. - You can have it. - That's crap! Wait! Wait...! Go home to your mummy! I can't find home. Don't you know where you live? You must know the name of your street. Go there, then. I'll go with you, but I have to change first. Come with me. Here we are! Do you live here? Sit down! Take this. This too. Can't you look the other way? Give me the pipe. Put the lid on. You have to have more leaves. That's enough, now. What are you doing? What can YOU do then? My balloon...! Give it here... I'll show you. Bite. Go on, bite! It tickles! You can make lots and lots! You gotta go home now. Will you come with me? I did promise. But first of all... You've seen our hideout, so we have to make a blood-compact. It won’t hurt you. Suck it! Put out your hand. Are you a scaredy-cat? That's it. Now you can't squeal. Open the door! - Open the door! - The door's open! Come in and close the door. Is it the time to come? Goodness me! - Where's your cap? - My cap? Tell me where you've been and don't tell lies. I ran and came to some water, and Goran fell in. Which Goran? What are you talking about? Now the water's running! Take your finger out! You're a big girl! - It's sore! - Rubbish! Goran pricked my finger. You take your eyes off the girl for one second, and what happens!? You tell me everything. I promise I won't tell Mummy. First he fell in, then we ran to the woods. Then he took his clothes off. And he pricked my finger. And he made baby balloons! He took his clothes off? Was he quite naked? Do you realise you've done something really dirty? What do you think Mummy and Grandma would say? Mummy would really give you what for. But it's not possible, now that HE is here! - It'll get lively. - The old girl looked furious. The young one was nearly fainting... Not far off. She's still in love with him, for sure! She looks as though she wants to throw her arms around him. You run and wash your hands and face and look your best! And come straight back here again! - So, what did he say? - Well, you know how... - The truth is always unpleasant. - But it comes in handy. I'd like to remind Bertil as to who paid for your home. We would've been happier if we'd never seen that six-room apartment. If only we'd just been left in peace! It's your fault if our marriage breaks up now. I suppose you think you gave Birgit a good upbringing. But you've not taught her the most important thing. Independence. Yes, I've been unfaithful. So what? My wife's the one I love! Love! You've no right to use the word. Hey... You believe me, don't you? Tell me you believe me. Yes, Bertil, I believe you. Come home with me, then... Come back to our home. OUR home? You surprise me, Bertil. It's only Birgit's home. Not yours. Yeah... It simply won't work any longer. Birgit, you have to choose. Come with me right now, or stay with your mother. In which case, we won't see each other again. Never again. Daddy! Dear Daddy... Don't go away! You mustn't go! Daddy! Miss Roos? Oh yes... Wait while I see if she's in. Miss Roos? A phone call for you. Guy or woman? - A guy. - Lucky your mum didn't answer. I'm sorry... but this used to be my room. Feel free! It's in a helluva mess. Phone for Miss Gorel. Yes? Arne... So-so. Yes, I'd love to. But you know... Mum... I'll ask them. If I can, I'll be right there. 'Bye. Can you explain this? . Today is the 10th of May. The coupons are valid until the 17th. But all the ones for butter have been used up. 327-328 are still valid. For margarine. Can't eat it on bread. That poultry forcemeat needed a lot. "Poultry forcemeat"? What are you talking about? That was that time you were away. It's coupon-free. Yes, that wasn't all. It's 23 cents out on the joint account... And expenditure on detergent is higher than it should be. She sits there with her old coupons and calculations! And I'm being accused of thieving! But can I get a taste of real coffee?! No, just miserable slops! Coffee happens to be rationed. There's such a thing as black market coffee! I won't stand for it! - Servants! - Mummy! You stay out of it. You don't understand Things are difficult these days, Gorel. If your mum hadn't taken charge of running the household... I should never have managed. During the last war the rationing was even harder than in this one. I remember 1917. That was the worst time for rationing. I'm still curious as how that poultry forcemeat was? It's coupon-free meat. Blood pudding is also coupon-free. It costs 1.80 a kilo. I'm happy to do the accounts, But remember, Mum... expenditure must be reduced. I talked to the accountant. We're already overdrawn this month. Of course you're right, Birgit dear. But it's so hard to cut down. No parties anymore. - No fun. - No, we live in different times. We all have to learn to make sacrifices. May I go and do homework with Arne? His dad invited me to stay for dinner. I don't think that's really appropriate. Can't you do your homework at home? Let he go. His father's a professor. A fine, educated man, I've been told. In that case, you can go. Don't be late home! Have a good time, Gorel! Hello. Well now!... Hello there! Isn't it very warm to be working, Mr Gustafsson? Too warm? No, I like it! People start getting so worked up about warm weather... ...they've already mothballed their woollens and taken out their inner windows. And you'd hardly call this work! Do you know if Arne's dad is in the studio? I think he went down to the lake. He's the one for heavy work. He's going to damage himself, wrestling with those lumps of clay. No, you could say it was sinful. No... Just think... it's nearly 4 years since she passed away. It was in the spring, wasn't it? She planted that tree herself... ...when we came here as newlyweds. You wouldn't understand. Nor anyone else, for that matter. 'Bye then! Arne! Arne! Hello! Hello. So.. it's homework time, is it? That's what lovely weather's for. Do you know where Arne is? No, I just got home. He'll be down by the lake. Sit down. There's no rush. Everything comes to those that wait, as the saying goes. Do you never feel guilty about lazing in the sun? Is it the sight of Gustafsson that makes you horrified at my laziness? Let me tell you something, my very young friend... Laziness is the key to creation. Not the laziness of idleness, or bad conscience either. No, the real laziness, the one that forces us to silence and contemplation. But it does require training... ...and a certain predisposition. How are things going for you? Well, thanks. Gorel... The only way not to be part of a false environment, is to leave it. Forget homework for the moment. Get a pair of overalls from Arne's room and go and help him. Off you go! - What's that you're wearing?! - Your dad's idea. He said homework could wait, to help you with the boat. Dad's been getting some nutty ideas lately. Have you seen his latest sculpture? You and your dad are the funniest people I know. It's like you are in charge, rather than him. I am, but you wouldn't understand. You in a bad mood? There's a scraper there. All the old undercoat has to come off. Arne... Yeah?... Do you need help? No... not at all! Aren't you tired yet? Nope. Are you? Me? You gotta be joking! - Hey... aren't you tired? - Nope. Are you? Me? You gotta be joking! Now I'm tired. Now I want to sunbathe. Listen... do you want to come sailing with Dad and me, this summer? - Do you want me along? - Dad's suggestion. You have to want to see something else besides a posh beach resort. It'd be nice for you to have someone who could cook and keep house. Can you cook? Apart from boiling a kettle? Yes I can cook! Put me down! You're dad suggested I come with you. But don't YOU want me to? Don't be silly. Do you want an invitation with "RSVP"? Of course it'd be great to have you along. The mornings are the loveliest... ...when the boat creaks and gently sways. You never get to wash... Just stick your head in the water! Like a dirty frog. Is that you?! 3 o'clock. 1500 hours. Monday the 10th of May, 1943. The Germans are in Charkov, Narvik and Tunis. Goebbels says that their greatest success lies in the first two thirds of the war. Gallup says that 58 per cent of Swedes believe we can stay out of the war. I read something in the paper today. In Copenhagen, the sirens sound 3 times in the event of an air alarm. Greta, aged 4, is with her mother in the botanical gardens. "Mother, what are those bright red flowers?" "They aren't flowers, they're called sirens." Greta looks scared. "They're not real flowers?" "Is that what's howling?" Arne... I have to tell you something. I haven't dared until now. I think if we were in the war, my family would be Nazis.. Why do you say that? I don't mean they'd be saboteurs or anything like that. They're way too lazy for that. It's worse than that... they're totally indifferent. All that matters is getting their food and clothes. - So they could be traitors to Sweden? - Just that. Their opinion of the safe-conduct ships is... "At last we get coffee and chocolate in this country." I feel like an accomplice. I eat what we've hoarded. I'm happy for a new dress, with black-market coupons. I want out! But I don't dare. When you've finished your studies, you'll probably marry some rich trader. No worries. I'll help you. If I don't get some food soon, I'll go home. Race you to the kitchen! What shall we serve the soup in? There are bowls on the shelf. - Where are you going? - To lay the table. You think my friend the art professor rates the dining room? Just lay the kitchen table. Dad, what will I... the radishes, yes... Don't forget to remove the bones from the side. I don't want one stuck in my throat. Why do you have to throw your weight around? Arne isn't much of a fan of mine. Why is that? I've got Henry Moore on the brain. When I see your stuff compared with his... I wouldn't argue with you. Is he cute? - Henry Moore? - No, the other one. Very stylish... Just your type. Do you actually know who Henry Moore is? - Should I? - Yes, for you own sake. You should activate your Grey matter more often. - So you won't die curious. - Is there anything to have with the herring? Quite correct my son, herring requires more. I'll see what the house can offer. Yeah... There sure ain't much. Don't push! You're in the way. Garnish with that tired beetroot. No, not beetroot. We can chop some parsley. How original! We'll have herring with French scrambled eggs Crazy! There won't be any more eggs for ages. We shall have scrambled eggs. This is a celebration! We have to think about "afters" like coffee. Have you tried the coffee substitute? Slops? In MY house?! There's something else to think about in the studio. It was delightful to have such a charming young lady at the table. A rare pleasure in this male-accentuated household. Don't get excited, she's spoken for. He's cute! Frightfully old, but quite cute. He's got a damned cheek! If he comes again, I'll be out of here. - And Dad just laughed. - Don't be silly! "A rare pleasure in this male-accentuated household."! Imagine talking about mum like that! Perhaps he wasn't aware... Aware? Of course he was. I've heard dad talk about when mum died. And you making a spectacle of yourself! It was awful watching you making eyes at him. Hey... when we've finished the dishes we can go out for a while before it gets dark. What are you laughing about? Is washing-up that much fun? I can do tricks... Shall I? That I'd have to see to believe. Would the gentleman like to see this dish disappear? Go on then. I Just need a magic wand. Magic wand! The 6 goes up there. Of course. She should be home by now. She's getting later every time. This time I'm out! I'm going to bed. So should you. No... I'm waiting till Gorel comes home. Times are different now to what they were when we were young. Yes, it's another age. You're right there, Mum. Good night. Here is the evening news. There are reports of a violent air attack on Catania. There was a huge explosion when a tanker was hit... These are from Mr Rocke for you and Grandma... For the first real spring day. And I don't know the gentleman. And for that matter, I don't accept bribes. It's only 11 o'clock and we didn't start dinner till 9. You know you're to be in bed by 10 on weekdays. And how can you stand there with a straight face, saying "ONLY 11?! We had so much to talk about. You had so much to talk about? You and that Arne of yours? I'm not as stupid as you think. I know very well what you two were up to. At your age, I hadn't even kissed a boy... But for all I know, you're on the way to having an illegitimate child! That's not true... We've never...! If not him, someone else... or any number! You're a slut! Nothing but a slut! What on earth...? - What's the matter? - I was going to... Come on in and calm down. Don't be silly... Just come in. You can't wake the professor in the middle of the night. I wasn't him that I wanted to see. What's wrong? Can I stay here tonight? I've left home. I can wake up Dad and ask him. That's not what I want! I wan to stay with YOU. I want us to be together... Really. If you don't want to... just say so. How long are you going to sit there? As long as I want to. You aren't going to start blubbing are you? Do you have to switch the light on? What does it matter? What are you... Leave my fucking drawing alone! What drawing? A building. A proposal for a garage and 12 apartments. I've got a better sketch you can see... Wait there! A church! Though not a temple to the Lord... ...which makes the congregation feel that the church shuts Him out. No, like this... Clean and simple. It should not seem demanding. Not for people to stop and think... "That's a church!" They enter it to feel humble... or uplifted. Can you understand... It will be something clean... something... ...which feels like diving under water to watch the sun's rays refract. Or sailing in a really strong breeze. Understand? It's still just a church. Everything is just as important... Garage, old people's home, block of flats... But it's from there that one can... One can progress until... I'll find it! I really will! Have you always known what you wanted? 2 years to go til matriculation. Then Tech. Then I'll go into practice. I'll practice in the summer holidays, too. Anything at all. Be a bricklayer's labourer. Know what? I've never told anyone this before. It's the first time. Are you regretting this? No. But I didn't know it hurt so much. If I did get pregnant, it would serve them right. What would YOU do then? Let it be taken away? Are you crazy?! We'd celebrate. But listen... Before, when we were fooling around in the garden... ...you didn't want to at all. Was it out of defiance, that you're here now? Firstly, you're right, it was. Secondly...? - I'm sorry... - No, stay there, you're no bother. Where's that damned pad gone? Goodbye. Good luck. My daughter... Mrs Rocke. Mr Ylven, the art dealer. Some familiar items. You don't mind if I look around? Of course not. It was mostly that painting... ...and the old Chinese porcelain, that it was about. How can you? First the silver and now this. Does SHE know about it? My dear girl, you don't think I'd do it behind my own mother's back?! Of course she knows about it. But her illness can go on forever. But day and night care costs money. A great deal of money. You only do it to humiliate her... Out of revenge. I don't know what you're talking about. It's a pity the set isn't complete. - How much do you think? - Not more than 1,500. That's worth much much more! Retail, it would be. Retail. There's a difference. You needn't even bother. She won't live much longer. How would YOU know that? She won't live much longer. It's nice of you to take the time to come and see me so often. I see it's spring now. Yes, it's spring. Would you open the blinds? Shall I open the window a little? Yes, do. You're looking happy today. Is it something special? I was lying here thinking about the palm tree. The palm tree? I turned 19 that year. I was newly married and very happy. I liked having a good time. I loved dancing. Your grandfather... He was so much older than me. He wasn't fond of balls and parties. But he often gave in. Wanted to please me... ...see me happy. How are things with Arne? and the children? Fine. The children are well. Lena can stand up now. Tell me about the palm tree . There was to be a high-profile charity ball in the Hall of Mirrors. . It was the high point of the season. I was so excited. For several weeks I gave your grandfather hints. I thought he'd started to weaken. You'd best close the window. I'm feeling a bit chilly. Yes... so the big day arrived. I was walking up and down in the apartment. Then the doorbell rang. I nearly flew out into the hall. A surprise! It must be my ball-gown. He hadn't forgotten. No... he'd not forgotten. There was a present for me. It was standing in the hall. There was no light on, so I didn't see it at first. It was the palm. I didn't get to the ball, but got a pot plant instead. He loved me... in his own way. Didn't he buy anything? Yes, but it will be picked up later. What are you doing? I keep accounts. Oh, Arne phoned. He said he had to work back this evening. He won't be home till later. Tell me, can you really afford to have a maid on Arne's salary? He's just had a raise. Construction engineers are supposed to earn quite a lot. Just what exactly does he work at? Oh, yes... he gets to carry out the work of the real architects. Right? Yes. On it he provides for his wife and two children. You know... I never would've believed Arne would have been so sensible... ...that he gave up his plans to become an architect, the long way. I guess it had become impossible. It's just useful to learn to give up. If he's really interested, there are evening courses, of course. Or he could do it on the side as a hobby. What's got into HER? - Hi. - Oh, it's you... Come in... I'm on my own. This is the first time I've been here. Yes, so it is. What are you doing? I'm working on Lanning's school. Why do you ask? Just curious. A newly acquired interest? I know! You've been talking to Mummy. I listen to nothing she says. Not what she says... what she thinks. Something like... "I wonder how long he can manage..." "I wonder how long they can keep up appearances!" Tell her to not bother waiting for me to give in. I should probably be able to support her daughter as well as any wholesaler. Why don't you say something? Why aren't you yelling? Because I feel guilty. If only it was that simple... ...for one of us to be the guilty party. I'll show you what I mean. Well, do you understand what I mean? It isn't that it's a cross? No. It has nothing to do with God. Not in the ordinary sense anyway. Do you often come here? Sometimes. To see what I shall never be allowed to do. Nothing correct, clean and simple. Never anything that's my own. Maybe it's not too late. No, in the end I've made the choice. It was only the difference between us... ...that allowed you to give birth to your children... ...that I can never do. Do you remember the first time we were together... that evening? You asked me... "Do you regret this?" Now it's my turn to ask... Do YOU regret it? And I'll give you the same answer as you gave then... No, I don't regret it. But I didn't know that it would hurt so much. Not only the first time. It hurts every time. Every single minute of the day. Are you still here, sweetheart? I saw there was a light, but I thought Miss Roos had left it on again. Mum... Will you answer me honestly about something? Have you ever regretted separating from Dad? There hasn't been a day... ...when I haven't regretted it. Do you think you're going to be happy in this new home? I'll be very happy. It doesn't matter if you howl... Nasty, naughty boy! I'm going to jump! I'll be lying dead on the ground. Don't jump, Lena! Don't jump! Lena! Lena... Lena! What are you doing? Bjorn and I were playing. He's dumb, and believes everything I say. Do you often play like that? Maybe. But I believe in you. I trust you. Hop into my bed and we'll talk when I've tucked Bjorn in. Come on, Bjorn. Why have you come back? I haven't "come back," as you put it. I've come to pick up a few things. Arne. Arne... Do you know the first time I felt we belonged together? It was here, when we worked on the boat, during the war. The sirens went off. I didn't want to listen to them. I sat with my hands over my ears, and... ...then you took them away. Why haven't you done that again? Why haven't you shaken me... ...during the years when I only slept? i was too involved with my own stuff. I SHOULD fix it. No one thought it would last the first few years. Me neither, but we had Dad. But then... when he died... I didn't notice... didn't want to see it. But he was the only person I could talk with. I got so lonely. - Listen... - Yes? Are the kids asleep? Yes, they're asleep. Do you think we could leave them for a bit? Now. Just for a bit. A few hours. Yeah... Gerda's coming, so they won't be alone. Where are we going? To the yacht. Wait! What are you doing? I can't run! Is it too late for us to start again? It's never too late! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
