Yes, please. Can you change the music? Anything else is fine. Hey Toni, I'm on my way already. I'm telling you, Yvette, won't let you down. I've been seeing her for years and her guidance is always right on the money. I'm sure it is. I know you don't believe in what she does but I'm glad you let me schedule a reading. You're heading to Nashville after? Yes, I'm staying at Cassie's. Good. I don't want anyone knowing you're there. Can you imagine the frenzy it will cause? I don't want anyone knowing I'm there either. Okay, good. Now this is just a writing session, hopefully. Yeah, hopefully. Well, say hi to Cass for me and have a good flight. Are you? No. We don't need those today. Why? I though I was here to get a reading. You're here because you're blocked creatively, and you need to find a way to move beyond whatever that is. Wow, Toni really filled you in didn't she. Who's Toni? My manager. I'm Layne Price. Okay. My manager Toni made an appointment for me to discuss my writer's block with Yvette. Ah, I'm Zelena. Yvette is sick. I can reschedule your reading with her another time if you'd like but. No, it's fine. Okay. Let's get started. Um, I think I might need to warn you I'm a skeptic so this might not work on me. On the contrary it's skeptics like you whose teachers shout the loudest so that people like me can hear them. They're so used to being ignored. Teachers? Yes, teachers. Some call them spirit guides or angels, but I call them teachers because they teach me about you. And yours are a chatty bunch. So they're all around us. Hi, guys. It's so nice of you to tag along. They're happy that you came. They hope that your trip to Nashville is a good one. - How did you know that- - You moved recently from a place where your creativity thrived to a place where it became stifled. Yes. You need to try to go back there. You're talking about Nashville and, and I already am. Oh, Nashville is a physical place, yes, but I'm also talking about an emotional place, a state of being. A place where you need to learn to love again. Love again like love music again? Maybe. C! someone just said the letter C. Does that mean anything to you? No, means nothing to me. Strange. Maybe it's a person. Yes, it's a person. Could be a thing. Okay. So, go to Nashville, learn to love again and connect with someone or something that has to do with the letter C. Anything else? Yes. You need to confront your past, present, and future before you're able to move on. Move on creatively? Perhaps. Such insight. However you choose to do this, this trip might just offer you the chance to overcome your creative blockage. But be careful. If follow your heart, you should be okay. Well, this was enlightening. Thank you. This was, this was fun. Hey, I'm on my way already. That's great. I didn't check any bags, so I'm headed straight to the taxi line. I should be at your house in 30 minutes. Oh no, no, no, I sent my driver Marley to come pick you up, my treat. She should be there with a name card. Cassie, I told you I need to be discreet while I'm here and a name card with my name on it is the exact opposite of that. Arlene Peckerwood, huh? Great, right? It was Freddie's idea. Of course it was. All right, well, I've obviously found your driver, and I'm following her through the airport as we speak. I'll see you soon. See ya soon. Girl, you are about to explode. What is going on? I am gonna tell her tonight. You're what? Okay, but seriously, are you really going to? Yeah, I am. So that's why you said you couldn't come see me tonight. I see how it is. Sorry. Good for you honey. It's about damn time. I gotta get going. If you change your mind about tonight, you know, I'd still love seeing you both. Maybe we can have brunch while she's here. Yeah, if you ever leave the bedroom. Yeah, true. Good luck, and don't forget to hydrate. I gotta get ready. Welcome to Nashville. Thanks. Good to be back. You look familiar. Have we met before? I must have one of those faces. Layne, is that you? Yeah, it's me. I can't believe you're here. Me too. Wow, you look. Yes. Cold. - Oh. - For me? Actually these are both for me. - What? - Just yanking your chain, here. Thanks. Mmm. Mmm. - Yeah - I needed this. Thanks for having me. I'm glad you're here. Yeah, me too. Apparently, it's just what the doctor ordered and by doctor, I mean psychic. Wait, you went to see a psychic. Tell me everything. I will in a minute. Right now I just wanna get my sweats so I can sit and relax with you. You need any help? No, I got it. Which guestroom should I stay in? Whichever one you'd like. Hey could we maybe talk about the song I've been trying to write when I finish changing? Yeah, sure, sounds good. Great. Just be yourself. ♪ The hours of the night ♪ ♪ When I can't sleep I'm haunted by my life ♪ ♪ And secrets that I keep ♪ ♪ It's 4:05 am I wonder where you are ♪ ♪ The world is dark and still ♪ ♪ And memories like a scar ♪ ♪ I hold myself tight ♪ ♪ I feel the clock strike ♪ ♪ The hours of the night stretch on and on ♪ ♪ Nothing's been right ♪ ♪ Since you've been gone ♪ ♪ If you hear my prayer wherever you are ♪ ♪ Come back and light the hours of the night ♪ Such a sad song. What? "Hours of the Night", it's sad and not like you. How do you know what I'm like? Are you serious? Cass, I'm your best friend, I think I know you pretty well. I wrote the song after you left, a lot can change in a year. Oh, really? Well, enlighten me. Who is it about? Because it's obviously about someone you loved and lost, and I though you and I didn't keep secrets from each other, especially when it came to our relationships. I'll stop prodding. I hope she knows how great you are. All right, well at least tell me if you've ever been in love? Once, terrible experience. Anyone I know? No. Will you ever tell me who it is? Maybe. Okay. Is it the song you're writing? It is. ...Got any lyrics yet? Nope. I've gotten the music written I just can't for the life of me figure out the words. It's okay, you're halfway there if you have the music. What do you think the holdup is with the lyrics? I don't know, just old fashioned writer's block I guess. I've tried everything I can think of to get over it. I've, I've gone, gone people watching. I tried meditating, which was a disaster. I even got Toni to convince me to see her psychic. Oh, that's right, what'd they say? Just a bunch of weird stuff about needing to confront my past, present, and future. And some other stuff about making amends. Oh, and something about the letter C. The letter C. I think, I think I know what they're talking about. Caroline, yeah, I think so too. Yeah. Why Caroline? I mean, y'all broke up last year. I know, but what if I'm not over her? Regardless, I need closure and I honestly don't know who else the psychic could have been talking about. I think I need to see her. Sure, okay. But I don't know how to get in touch with her since she's so thoroughly blocked me from her life. I guess if I'm truly gonna take the psychic's advice then I've done at least one thing right so far. Yeah, what's that? Coming here. The psychic said, "I need to return to the root of my success." That's Nashville. You know, you're welcome here anytime, right? I mean, you don't need a case of writer's block to come and visit me. And you definitely don't need a psychic to tell you to visit. I know, I know. All right, wanna show me what you got? Mm-hmm. Please. Dude. My lady. - Go ahead. - I just got nervous. Don't. - Okay, okay. - You're gonna be fine. It's still a work in progress, but the verse goes a little something like this. Okay. ♪ Da, da, di, da, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, da, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ No pre. - Okay. - Unless you think - there should be one. - Okay. And then chorus. ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, da ♪ ♪ Da, da, di, di ♪ ♪ La, da, da ♪ ♪ Di, di ♪ ♪ Da, da, di ♪ It's gonna end just like that. - Yeah. - I love that ending. It's great. It really is. I think I know what we need. More wine. - Yes. - Great. No, we need to talk to Freddie. That's actually not a bad idea. He's helped me with a ton of my songs. But he's like super busy tonight, 'cause he's MCing at a pop up bar at Germantown, and then he's going home to host a New Year's party. No, I don't need him to write the song with me. I was hoping he might help me reach out to Caroline. Are they still best friends? Mm-hmm. Do you think he might know what she's up to tonight? I think she might be at Germantown to support him. Really? Only one way to find out. Okay, that's unfortunate. I guess the only option now is to go to Germantown. Duh, no, I don't think that's a good idea. I seriously doubt Freddie wants to talk to me anyway. Are you kidding me? He would love to see you, and he'd love it even more if we went out to see him tonight. He told me so himself. - He did? - Mm-hmm. No, it's no good. The last place I need to be is some jam-packed bar on New Year's Eve. Toni asked me to stay in anyway. And besides you know how much I hate New Year's. Something bad always happens. Okay, stop pitchin' a hissy fit. If you wanna find Caroline tonight, I'm all in. All right, we can stay home all day tomorrow and write. It's the perfect way to start off the new year. But what about Toni? She would freak out if we got noticed. We cannot be seen. - Okay. - At all. All right, we won't be recognized, I promise. And we can also come home whenever you want. I didn't bring any clothes for going out. That's not a problem either. I have something you can wear. Yeah, but is it discreet? Of course, it is. This is such a bad idea. Oh, hush your mouth. We look great. Well, yeah, but we aren't exactly unnoticeable. That is why I got us these. I meant for us to wear them at home but plans change, right? See, perfect. Come on, let's go. Come on. So where to ladies? Germantown to see Freddie. How did I know you would say that? Maybe you're psychic. Maybe I am. So what made you decide to change plans this evening? Freddie left his phone in the living room and we're going to return it to him. Well, you're awfully dressed up for phone delivery. We figured since we're making the trip anyway why not use this opportunity to do a little bit of partying? I can't argue with that. New Year's is one of Layne's least favorite holidays. True. Well, I can see why some people like to stay in on New Year's Eve, especially if they don't like large crowds. Sometimes it's nice to spend the evening with loved ones. So I've been told. Ooh, I love this song. Can you turn it up? You know I can't stop once it's started. No. It's contagious. There's no cure. - Come on. - Oh, I'm embarrassed to be your friend. No, come on, don't leave me hanging. - What is this? - I don't know. We're gonna have fun, okay. I know. Good. Am I that bad of a dancer? Don't answer that question. Yes. Freddie. - Hi. - You look great! Thank you. Goodness girl, you look amazing. What do they feed y'all in California? A steady diet of cynicism and avocados. You look really great too, by the way. Thanks. In the words of our lord and savior Dolly Parton, "It takes a lot of money to look this cheap." So what brings y'all out here tonight? We came here to bring you this. Oh my God, thank you. I have looked everywhere for this thing. You know you could have just waited to return it though, right? We know, but we also wanted to come out and see you tonight. And? And ask if you might know what Caroline's up to? Caroline? Why on earth would you want to revisit all of that? Because I'm a glutton for punishment. Because I think I might not have moved on since we broke up. You think you still love her? Yeah, maybe. If I could just talk to her, let her know how I feel, then maybe I might also be able to write songs again. Songs about what? Love? Honey no offense but your songs aren't exactly sunshine and daisies. But that's what's so great about them. Why steer away from that broken-hearted brand when it's always worked so well for you? Because I don't want to be broken-hearted anymore. I just need to talk to her, see how she's doing. I have no idea what she's been up to. If she's seeing anyone new? Yeah. Well, I don't know about that. She's been keeping to herself a lot lately. She's so busy working on her thesis. I doubt she's seeing anyone. So she isn't seeing anyone new. Well, I didn't say that. - What I said was- - This is it. This is why I was meant to come here. I thought you came here to write new music. Yeah, that too, but like I said, I can't do that until I talked to Caroline. I'd like to tell you that would be a bad idea but- - She wouldn't listen to you even if you did. Is Caroline supposed to be here tonight? Caroline mentioned she might go to Venue 109 to see Bobbie and the Bee Charmers. They're playing at Venue 109 tonight? Nope, hard pass. Oh, come on, it'd be so great for you to see your old band mates. And I know they'd love to see you. Yeah, right. You think just because you have unresolved issues from moving to LA that the friends you left behind do. Well, you're wrong, they don't. Was Freddie happy to see you tonight? Get off your high horse and be positive. Heal your past woman. Well, all right then, picklebacks anyone? Yes, please. Are you okay? Yeah, why? You just seem a little wound tight. Nothin' a little whiskey and karaoke can't fix. Ready ladies? Okay. Another. When I get back. I have to start another round of karaoke really quick. Y'all having a good time tonight or what? Well let's keep the good times rolling shall we. First up I wanna welcome to the stage a very dear friend of mine, who I think is in need of a little music therapy. So ladies and gentle folk, please join me in welcoming to the stage Arlene Peckerwood! Go, go, come on, it's gonna be fun. No one will know it's you. No, I hate this song. ♪ I wish I never fell in love ♪ ♪ I wish I never gave a damn about you ♪ ♪ I shoulda kept my player ways ♪ ♪ I'm looking back at better days ♪ ♪ I have to get this thing out of my mind ♪ ♪ Do something else with my time ♪ ♪ I'm about to ♪ ♪ Pull the plug ♪ ♪ Flatline ♪ ♪ You done run out of time ♪ ♪ Pull the plug ♪ ♪ Flatline ♪ ♪ You done run out of time ♪ ♪ The love I had for you is gone ♪ ♪ Enough of sad I'm moving on ♪ Layne Price. ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, I wish I never gave you none ♪ ♪ I wish dysfunction wasn't fun ♪ ♪ But somehow you had a way of touching me ♪ ♪ I felt like I couldn't breathe ♪ ♪ I see now ♪ ♪ I took you to the ER ♪ ♪ But I'm the one left with the scar ♪ ♪ I need pull the plug ♪ ♪ Flatline ♪ Oh, what a show, huh, folks. Sounded just like the original, didn't it? You are a crazy person, you know that? What are you talking about? That's my favorite karaoke song. I know, how could you not like doing that song, come on? It's so good. - Hi. - Hi. Wow. I know, why do I feel like you go karaoke incognito every Saturday? I mean maybe I do, you don't know. What happened in there? Layne sang a karaoke version of "Flatline", and it was awesome. Yeah, until people recognized me and we had to go. - Sorry. - Do you ladies want me to take you home now? Actually, I think we're gonna go to 109, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Layne. Huh? Why did you say you hate your own song? I don't know. I just, everywhere I go, all anyone wants to hear is "Flatline", but I have other songs, you know good songs, songs I'd rather be known for. The record label kinda turned it into their own thing, and I just want it to be behind me, you know. I know the feeling, believe me. You should stand up to them, do what you want to do, enjoy it. I mean that song got you to where you needed to be in your career. I know, I know. All I'm saying is respect your intuition. If you don't like singing "Flatline" find a way to enjoy it. I liked singing with you. Because we had fun. Plus it's kind of a banger. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah, it totally is. And we're gonna have fun at 109, and your friends are gonna be just as excited to see you as Freddie was. And when I run into Caroline. If you run into Caroline, you will tell her how you feel and you will be happy for her regardless of her feelings for you. You're right. I know I am. It's Toni. How much you want to bet she knows about my little karaoke performance? Hi, Toni, how are you? Layne, I asked you to do one thing for me while you were in Nashville. One thing, do you remember that one thing? To write new music. Well, yes, but also don't let anyone know that you're there. How hard can that be? Apparently harder than I anticipated. I thought you and Cassie were staying in tonight, at least, that's what you told me you were doing. Hi, Toni. That was my fault Cassie, is that you? Yeah, it's so nice of you to call. Hey, did you see Layne's performance at the Germantown pop up bar, wasn't it excellent? Well, yes but. I mean, I can certainly say from my perspective it was great and the audience loved it. Even though I had no idea it was actually Layne singing. Oh, well I thought- - And even if they had noticed what's not to love about a pop star who goes out on New Year's Eve and gives an impromptu performance of the hit song that made her this year's breakout artist. Nothing, but. All we did was give some unsuspecting fans a little treat and now it's over and we are on our way home. You are? We are? But I thought we were- - Yes, I can take her home. Okay, good. Yeah, I think, I think that may be best. Okay, well, thank you so much for calling. Happy New Year, bye. Cassie, Cassie. I swear that woman could start an argument in an empty house. Could say the same about you. I don't start arguments. I win them. We'll be back in a little while. Okay. Hey, everything's gonna be fine. We'll be real quick, okay. In and out. That's what you said last time. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ You give me that radio silence ♪ ♪ Ooh, there's crickets in the air ♪ ♪ And I can hear them crying, crying, crying ♪ ♪ I can hear them crying ♪ They sound really good. ♪ You give me that ♪ Yeah, they do.

How have you been? I never thought I'd see you again. I'm good. Bobbie, your voice is just. Thank you. Thanks Layne, that means a lot. Ah, is there a break room we can move this sweet little reunion to? Of course, I'm sure you remember the way. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried by the way y'all might react when you saw me. I tried to tell her y'all would be happy to see her but she wouldn't listen. We're all family here. Yeah, it did suck when we found out you were leaving us for LA, but only for awhile. We can't blame you for wanting to chase your dream, we'd be hypocrites. You got the opportunity that we didn't, you had to take it. We would've done the same thing. I'm really sorry for the way I left. We're fine without you. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just we've all moved on, and you should too. And now that you know we don't hate you, can you call once in a while, reach out, keep in touch? Yeah, you can call any of us anytime. There was actually something I was hoping y'all could help me with. I've been having trouble writing new music, which is why I'm here, to get inspiration for a new song. Maybe tomorrow if it's okay with you we could get together and have a jam session, maybe play some old music.

Thanks. What are you doing? Toni's gonna kill me. Speak of the devil. - Hi, Toni. - Hi, Toni. You're on speaker. Good, because I need to talk to both of you. What about? I saw your little show at Venue 109. Yeah, I can explain what happened was- Keep it up! What? Layne, you are trending on social media right now. They think your performances for tonight are part of some well-coordinated plan, which I'm taking credit for by the way, to roll out new music for the new year. See, I told you it was a good idea to go out tonight. And Cassie. Yup. You're a part of the chatter, so you keep it up too. Keep what up? When two of the music industry's most out queer artists are seen together in public people can't help but speculate if they're a couple. A couple? Yes, your hashtag is #Lassie. Like the dog. Okay, wait, Toni, how did they know it was me? Really Cassie, those glasses were about as effective as Clark Kent's. Also you used your social media account to stream Layne's performance. Oops. No oops, keep doing it. Wait, wait, wait, this is besides the point. Toni, I don't have any new music out and Cassie and I are friends. Yes, but your fans don't know that. Also you'll eventually have new music. Isn't that the whole point of you going to Nashville anyway? - Yeah, but- - Not buts, just go out there and promote it! - I know, but- - Okay, thank you so much Toni, we're hanging up now, bye. Did everything go okay in there? Yeah it did. We didn't find Caroline though. Do you want to keep looking for her? Actually, I wouldn't mind going to the store for some snacks. Sound good to you? Yeah. I just texted Freddie to see if he might know where she's at since Venue 109 was a bust. Might be awhile until we hear from him. To the store we go. Toni was right, everyone's talking about your pop up performance. Oh, this is great. Everyone wants to know more about Bobbie and the Bee Charmers. What, what? - Nothing. - What is it? - Nothing. - Let me see. - No, no, no. - Let me see- - No. - It. Just saw Layne Price sing at 109 and all I wanna know is who's that mystery girl she keeps looking at in the audience? Mystery girl. ♪ To believe in something that I couldn't see ♪ Ah, that's funny. Yeah, funny. I can't believe they think we're a couple. I know, weird, right. The music in that video was nice. Was that you, Layne? Yeah, it was me and the band I used to play with. I would've stayed and played some more but the crowd got a little wild. That's great though. Getting to play with your friends must have been cathartic. Yeah, it was actually. Which is weird because I usually hate New Year's. Yeah, we know. I don't. Why do you hate New Year's? It would seem Layne has incredible luck. I mean, look at her, she's got a killer set of pipes, she's hot, she's the bestselling new artist of the year, but, but when it comes to New Year's. I have terrible luck. When I was eight, I broke my nose jumping on a Pogo stick. And what day was it? New Year's Eve. Then there was a time, I got food poisoning and puked at Kyle Hardwick's house. Oh, bumped my head on his toilet and had to get stitches. And what day was it? New Year's. Then there was the time I ghosted Caroline. My manager gave me an ultimatum said, "I had to fly out to LA to meet with the people who could make my dreams come true." And when was this once in a lifetime meeting scheduled? New Year's Eve last year. You only had two hours to make a choice before the plane to LA took off without you. That's why I hate New Year's. But tonight we're gonna change your luck. Okay, we're gonna make sure only good things happen. And how do we do that? By doing all the fun stuff we used to. Toni said, "She wanted us to keep doing what we're doing" - Right? - Right. So let's have a little fun with it. Do you trust me? All right, try to figure out where you wanna go next while I'm inside. We have two hours till midnight. And then this car turns into a pumpkin. Something like that. Okay, we'll figure it out. What? - What's wrong? - Nothing, just thinking about what a great time I've had with you tonight. I hope you are too. Yeah, tonight's been, it's been great. That sounded convincing. No, really, I'm glad you're having a good time. You're easier to be around when you're happy, believe me. Thanks. Has Freddie answered your text yet? No. Do you know where you wanna look for Caroline next since Germantown and 109 were a bust? I wouldn't call them a bust. I got to spend time with you and my friends, didn't I? You didn't find Caroline though. Yeah, but that's not. Can I ask you something? Mm-hmm. Why are you so invested in helping me find Caroline? You left, you left and when you did I didn't think I'd hear from you again. And then I did and I realized how much you meant to me. You're my best friend. And if you want to spend New Year's Eve running all over God's green earth searching for your ex then that's what I'll do too if it means I get to spend time with you. But I don't know if I can keep doing this, not when I feel the way I do about you. Not when you look at me the way you do. How do I make you feel? Oh, it's Freddie. He knows where Caroline is. Wow that's, that's great. Did you two make any decisions? Nope. I don't think she met in a figurative sense. Where to next? Can we go to the park please? Caroline's having a party nearby. Maybe after I meet up with her, you and I can do another video in the park since we'll already be there. Sure. The park it is. Happy New Year! I've never seen the sky so clear. Look it's my namesake. You were named after the Big Dipper? Cassiopeia, you dork. I guess when your parents name you after the stars it's only fair that you become one. Country music star living in Music City itself. How's it feel? Pretty awesome. I used to think these buildings were like castles, or taller than mountains. I miss living here. You do? Of course I do. I think about it all the time. Going to school with you, singing at open mic nights together, hiding from tornadoes in our bathtub in the place we used to live. This is where you first met Caroline. We were studying on this bench, and I got up to get some water, and when I came back there was a long pair of legs taking my spot beside you. Yeah. Do you think she'll be excited to see me? There's something I don't get about your breakup with Caroline. You loved each other so much, why did you let distance break you up? It didn't seem fair to either of us. I couldn't ask her to put her life on hold so I could follow my dream. Maybe you could have let her choose that for herself. What if we stopped worrying about the future and focus on the present? Maybe I will. What are you doing? Caroline's over there, go, go. Knowing Freddie, he's already told her you're coming. I'm not ready, not yet. Will you sit down with me for a while? I don't think I should. I'm gonna go get some water. Right on time. Layne. Caroline, I've been looking for you all night. Why? I, um, I went to this. I saw your performances. You did? Yeah. I didn't realize you'd be in Nashville for New Year's. It's good seeing you again. Really? I thought you wouldn't wanna see me again after what I did, leaving you the way I did. If you had run into me a few months ago I'm sure I wouldn't be as happy to see you as I am now. Took me months to get over you. Eventually my life moved on, and when it did everything I felt for you just stopped. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that in the best way possible. Layne, I only feel happiness for you now. You moving to LA was the right decision. Us breaking up was the right decision. I'm not made for long distance. You don't know how much I needed to hear that. I, I, I, miss talking to you. I, have so much to say. I have so many questions. Damn do I need your advice sometimes. Does this advice have anything to do with Cassie Holmes? - How did you- - Oh, come on, Layne. I know stage lights can be blinding sometimes but you have to see the way she looks at you every time you perform. It's the way she's always looked at you. And now it's the way you look at her. I don't know what to do. What should I do? It's really not that hard. Tell her that you love her. I will. Thank you. And, and Happy New Year's! Good luck! Bad New Year's Eve, huh? Yeah, I hate New Year's. Yeah, me too. All these resolutions just settin' us all up for failure. Where's Cassie? I need to tell her I love her. I saw her leave in a car. - She left. - And I think she was crying. Oh, God, you think she saw us? Of course she saw us. How can she know how I feel by the way I've acted tonight? You have to go after her, and do some grand gesture to prove to her that you love her. It always seems to work in the movies. Okay, I need to make a phone call. Hey, Freddie, it's me. Are you home? Yes, girl, and the party is in full swing. Okay, I have a huge favor to ask you. I'll explain once I get there. Okay, okay, thanks, bye. Okay, I have a plan. Okay. When I say now, can you hit record please? Sure. Why? You said to make a grand gesture, so I'm making one. Okay, okay, now. It's been great being back home in Nashville. Y'all sure know how to treat a girl nice. I know a lot of you are wondering why I'm here giving all these pop up performances. Well, the truth is writing songs when you're confused about your feelings can be tough. So many of my songs have come from a place of anger but I'm not angry anymore, I'm in love. And what I'm trying to say is Cassie, if you're watching this I figured it out. And for the first time everything makes sense. Tonight just before midnight, I'll be debuting a brand new song live online and this song is really special to me. And I hope that when you're watching it it's special to you too. Happy New Year's, y'all. You think it worked? I don't see how it couldn't. Right, okay. What time is it? Crap, we gotta go! What are you doing? We need to go I believe you have a song to write.

I need a pen and paper please, it's urgent. Okay, yeah. This is Marley, Cassie's driver. Oh, I know Marley. Hi, Freddie. Wait, where's Cassie? That's why I need the pen and paper. Cassie saw me with Caroline and left because she thinks I love Caroline, but I actually love her, which is why I've come here to tell her I love her with a song. Okay, got it. I guess I could also just go to her house and tell her myself how I feel but- - And resolve your misinterpreted feelings in the most obvious and logical way possible instead of making an over the top declaration of love.
