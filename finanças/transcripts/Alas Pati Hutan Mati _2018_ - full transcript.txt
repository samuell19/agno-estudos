Ran, I'll beat you to the top for 100,000 rupiah. Ditto. I'll place 100,000 rupiah for Raya. Don't bother racing up to the top, I might as well just hand you the money. You underestimate my ability. Plug your audio set to my camera right now, and start recording. You can use it for evidence later. I have to fight for my family's honor. -Dit, count to three. -Okay. Are you two ready? I'm going to start counting. -One, two, three! -Two, three! Penalty! You're cheating! After analyzing the pattern, if we shoot our video in a creepy place... ...we will get more views. When we uploaded our videos in Potato House and Lawang Sewu... ...we reached more than 10 millions views. But only after six months. That's too long. I think it's a good idea to make a video in creepy places. But do we have the nerve to make a scene out there? We won't get more views by talking to each other. -We have to find the most... -Guys, take a look at this. It's a very creepy place. A cemetery in the Alas Pati wood. Look at that. They say whoever is buried in that cemetery... ...would be tortured in the after life. "Whoever comes to Alas Pati Valley..." "...they'd never returned." -It's interesting, right? -And the trip will be super fun. That's most important, right? I'm in. "#AnythingToGetMoreViewers." #AnythingToPayTheRent. And to buy Yeezy. Where's Jessie? Call her, Dit. Hey, guys. I'm still in class. -What a poster student. -Nerd. Mr. Togar's class? I'm with Riska. Hang up! Jess? What are you doing in Mr. Togar's class? Is that you, Randy? -Why aren't you in my class? -I don't feel well today. No, you're not. What have you come down with? I have come down... ...with something severe. If you don't believe me, you can ask Raya. Yes, Sir... Why are you not in my class either, Raya? You're fit today, right? That's the most important thing, you know? I've got to go. See you, Mr. Togar. Randy! What are you getting dressed for? Get down here, quick! If you don't get down here right now, we're gonna leave you. Hurry up, just throw anything on! Do you know what time it is now? -Miss. -Yes? Your parents said they will come next week. So? I'm just making sure you're going to be home next week. I'll be home in two days. Bye! Look out! Thank you, Ma'am. Ma'am, is Alas Pati still far from here? Swallow your food, then talk. Ma'am, is Alas Pati still far from here? You can rent a boat and cross the beach through the woods. Is it true that the place is haunted? I think all places including mountains... ...beaches, and seas have claimed their victims. I've heard that the woods has a sacred cemetery. There are cemeteries of people who died by execution. Legend says they're still tortured in the after life. They're stuck between two realms. I've uploaded our trip to the woods. How many likes have we got? I've just uploaded it five minutes ago. You won't get more than 10 likes. Be patient, I know you have rent to pay. Souls are trapped in-between realms. I wonder what they've turned into. Maybe that's what we call wandering souls. Just like yourself. Why me? You've been wondering, right? Does Ditto have feelings for Raya? Seriously, Jess? How old is that cemetery? I didn't hear when she told us. Nobody knows. She said she knew about the legend of Alas Pati cemetery... ...ever since she was little. And who knows? Maybe she's 200 years old now. Like an avatar. It means that's the shorter path to the cemetery. Guys, we can get to the cemetery faster through that cliff. What? Seriously? Ditto, you remembered to bring our protection gear, right? I always bring mine. We're not talking about that kind of protection. Jess, Vega, wear this comms set. Okay. Here, hold this. I'm gonna help you put it on. That slimy octopus. You help Raya while I'm the one who needs help here! Say something. I want some satay, handsome. All right, I've heard enough. Thanks for those annoying sounds you've made. So, guys, five of us now are on our way to Alas Pati cemetery. It's said to be the most haunted place on Earth. So, let's do it! Wait! Wish us luck to the destination. Ran, let's go! I'm coming! Wait for me! Guys, let's set up our tent here. What? Seriously? Jess, please. You're no longer a teenager. Guys, guys. What the fuck is that? Where's Vega? Where is she? Ve! Vega! -Vega! -Vega! Vega! Ve! Guys... ...I think that's Vega. No, it's not. Ve, I know it's you! Yeah, I know it's her. That dress looks so perfect on you. Ray, be careful! She really scared me to death. Lucky I didn't pee myself. Vega, Vega. Raya! That's surely not Vega! What is it, Ray? Vega? Ve? Ve? Vega! Did you seriously bring that white dress and wig just to scare us? You should see the color of your face, Jess. Blue and purple. -What were you thinking? -It was Randy's idea! I'm sorry! -I hate you! -You're nuts! -I'm so satisfied! -You're too much. Ray, come here. Yes? Listen to this. Look at Ditto. Unbelievable. Nice move, man! Guys, you should come with me. Let's go! Oh, my God. This is great for my room's theme. We're in the middle of the woods, and out of nowhere, we found these. I don't know what these are. But there are many of them and they really freak me out. Raya, this is so fucking awesome! Where did you get your source? Hey, why are you so tense? Smile, please? Please, don't joke around. You know this is a cemetery. I have an idea to spice up our video. Let's take a wefie with them! We can show a close up shot. Am I right? "Them" who? I'm looking for the creepiest one. Hello, guys. We've just arrived at Alas Pati cemetery now. And I found the strangest thing here. We are used to seeing bodies buried in the ground. But what you're about to see is a body not buried in the ground... ...but on the ground. Excuse me, Sir. What do you think about our currency that dropped sharply... ...against the US dollar? Your answer, Sir? Could you answer the question? Don't be shy. What are you doing here? You are disturbing the elderly. You scared me! Spare me... You should sit in the front... Jessie, climb the grave. You're the last person who hasn't climbed on it. Come on, Jess. No, I won't. Come on, think about our viewers. Climb it! -Come on, Jess! -Jessie! -Come on, Jess! -Go, Jessie! Jessie, Jessie, Jessie... Sometimes, I question... ...my own judgment for being friends with you guys. Bad influence, man. Bad influence. -Climb to the top! -Jessie! -You can do it, Jess. -Go, Jessie! -Now speech! -Come on, Jess. All right, guys... (Alas Pati Woods of the Dead) And at last, we have to hike 15 kilometers uphill. So, let's do it! Wait! Wish us luck to the destination. Why are you so tense? Please, don't joke around. You know this is a cemetery. They're dead people. What can they do to us? Sometimes, I question... ...my own judgment for being friends with you guys. Bad influence, man. Bad influence. May 7, 2018. I'm trying so hard to erase it from my memory. I wish it never happened. Alas Pati. "Alas" means wood. "Pati" means dead. Why do they call it that? Woods of the dead. Why is it a forbidden place? Sometimes, I question... ...my own judgment for being friends with you guys. Bad influence. Jessie! -Come on, Jessie. -Go, Jessie! Jessie, Jessie, Jessie... Miss? I think something's attached to you from wherever you went to. -What do you mean? -It made a mess in this house. I want to talk to both of you about something. There's nothing to talk about. I know Jessie used to hang out with you and your friends. And now her mother keeps asking me about her... ...because her phone is off and she doesn't call at all. So? I want you to stop corrupting her. Her mother has already reported her missing to the dean. And I will make sure that you're on their interrogation list. Jeff. What can I do for you? -Did my friends come here today? -I haven't seen them all day. Jessie! Hello? Raya, this is Jessie's mother. Oh, yeah. How are you? Are you with Jessie right now? No, I'm not with Jessie right now. Her phone has been turned off since yesterday. She said she went to some kind of woods? I thought she went with you. Never mind, thank you. You're welcome. This is the definition of research instrument. A research instrument according to Arikunto is a tool which is chosen... ...and used by a researcher to collect data... ...in a methodological manner. The tools should be in accordance with research variables... ...operating instructions and its measurement scale. Second, the tool is for example by interviews. Interviews can be done by giving questionnaires to participants. Are you crazy? Why did you upload our trip to Alas Pati? Why did you upload our trip to Alas Pati? Uploaded what? I didn't upload anything. Watch this. It's not funny. Please, don't joke around. This is a cemetery. I'm not that crazy. I would never upload this video. And it wasn't there yesterday either. Are you saying that someone knows about our trip to Alas Pati? -It was recorded on Randy's camera. -Raya, Ditto, leave the class. Right now! Ditto? Dit! Ditto! Ditto! Ditto! What's wrong with you? Jessie. I asked Randy, and he said it wasn't him. I didn't do it. You know I don't want to make the situation worse for us. I think it's Vega. She needs the money to pay her rent. Ray, you can't keep acting that it never happened. Hey, wait. The Dean wants to see all of you. Right now. Take down the video now. I've just heard very disturbing news. Jessie's parents informed me... ...that she hasn't come home for two days. And nobody can contact her. Her cell phone is out of the service area. You're her closest friends. Do you know... ...where Jessie is right now? -I don't know, Sir. -He's lying. -How about Vega? -She's in her flat. I think she's sick. Is Jessie in her flat as well? You better tell the truth... ...so we can move on with our lives. Because if we still get no news... ...from Jessie tomorrow... ...we will call the police. Can we leave now? You may leave. Excuse me, Sir. But, Sir... Excuse me, Sir. Ve? Vega? Vega? Ve? Ve. What's wrong with you? She... She's in there. Who's "she"? Don't go in there. Please. Ray, don't open the door! Ray. She's hiding in there. Let's get out of here now! Vega! Let's go! I asked you guys to come here... ...because I'm concerned about Vega's condition. Since we left Alas Pati and Jessie was killed... ...I think she's traumatized. I've been trying to talk to you about this, but you kept avoiding me. And now you want to talk to us after you saw what happened to Vega? It's too late, Ray. If you didn't tell her to climb on the scaffolding... ...all of this wouldn't happen to us. Are you blaming me for her death? Didn't both of you cheer for her too? Who had the idea to go to Alas Pati in the first place? -It was Raya's idea. -We all agreed to go there. We agreed to get more views. You can't blame me for my idea! I told her to climb it for views. But you should've known better. We were on sacred ground. -You have to respect the dead! -It has nothing to do with my manners! Jessie climbed the scaffolding, she slipped, it was just an accident. The real question is, why didn't you let me help Jessie? I saw Vega ran away, and I didn't want us to get lost in the woods! Jessie! Jessie! Jessie! -Leave her! Let's go! -Jessie! I dragged you away from there to help me run after Vega. But we should've helped Jessie first. If you had just let me help her, she might be still alive! Enough! How is she? She's in the bedroom. She needs to rest. Ray... ...I want to show you something. Listen to this. Focus on the 8:14 time stamp. I don't hear anything. You're right. There's no strange sound at all. I'm going to turn on the sound pressure detector. Let's rewind the video. Focus on the 8:14 time stamp. What is that sound? I don't know. But it was certainly caught on the audio during the trip. You left your necklace in my car. My necklace? Vega, what are you doing here this late? Vega? Ve? Vega. Ve? Vega? Vega? Ve? Vega? Ve! Vega! Ve? Vega! Vega? Vega! Vega! Vega. Ve? Vega? Ve... Ve? Vega. Vega, control yourself. Vega, control yourself! Vega! Vega, control yourself! Vega! Ve! Vega! Vega! Vega? Ve? Vega! Ve? Vega! Who are you? Why are you disturbing me? I didn't disturb you! Jessie? Jessie, is that you? I'm so sorry, Jess. I tried to help you! I can't believe Vega killed herself. Where's her body now? The police took her body. We will be dead one by one. I couldn't sleep at all last night. I was trying to find a way to free us all from this poltergeist. I even went to a psychic. I know Vega was killed by Jessie's ghost. Keep your voice down. Nobody else should know what happened. We have to return to Alas Pati. We have to bury her appropriately. (MISSING - Jessica Winda 4th semester, Faculty of Economy) Leave me alone! So, let's do it! Wait! Wish us luck to the destination. Somebody, help me! Help! Hello. Is this you, Raya? Whose number are you using? You had a car crash? Where? We have to go to Alas Pati. Okay, I'll go get you. Hold her. Tomorrow, we have to tell them what happened to Jessie. We will face the consequences together. I think she's in peace now. (You have disturbed a sacred burial ground!)
