(energetic music) (dramatic music) (whistle trills) - Fall in! - Come on, come on, hurry up! Quick, quick, quick, quick! - Come on! Move it, move it, hurry! - Go on, get up there! Hurry up! Hurry it up! - Get in line! You're so lazy! If you don't mend your ways, I will keep you working outside until the sun roasts you! - Get out! Come on, move, move! Hurry up! - Go on, get out! - Come on, hurry up! - Back you go! Quickly! - Come on, come on, move it! Go ahead out! Get out, go on! Go on! Move, go on! Move it! - Hurry up! - Move it, come on! - Get a move on! - Welcome to training camp. (dramatic music) I'm the law here. You obey my orders, or I shall simply have you killed. (yells) Remember, you're gonna love it here. And now, I'll give you each a little welcoming gift. (dramatic music) - Come on! (screams) - You got her? - Yes, sir. - Show me. - Get her out. - Right. (yelling) - What's that? How did you get your wound? - Hmm, it's nothing. (screaming) - Huh? - Is that Donna Yang? - Yeah, it's her. (screams) - Pathetic! You'd better wise up! - Hmm. - How dare you! Are you tired of living, you little bitch? Stand, you. (whimpering) - Well, Miss Yang, you will like it here. If you tell me what I want to know, we'll let you leave this place immediately. - You heard, little cow. Answer her! - I don't know anything about microfilm! I don't know anything! - Donna, your dad knows very well what I am. I don't understand. How come a spy doesn't know her orders? You'd better do as you're told and hand it over, otherwise you'll be in big trouble. - Balls to you! I intend to get out of here and tell the world that you're monsters! - Helen. Get hold of that microfilm, whatever the cost. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) - Huh? Where has it gone to? (thunder crashes) - Hey, Susan. Let's leave it for the time being. We'll wait till tomorrow. - But why? - Look there. - Hey, do you think that she's a newcomer? - Yeah. We'll have to watch her really carefully, see who she is before we continue. - Okay. (explosions bang) (shouting) (frantic music) - [Prisoner] Hurry. - Are you okay? (shouting) - [Vulture] Hey! Stay there! Come back here! Leave her alone! Don't you dare go down there! Get back up there! Go on! - Stop it! Why are you hitting her? - You. What's your name? - Terry Yu. - Right, Terry Yu. Since you like to help, it's your privilege to carry that stuff up. Go, move it! That's the one, go on. Do it! Come on! Hurry up! Pull harder! Harder! Don't just stand there. Come on. Don't just stand there, you lazy cow. (gagging) - Where are you going? - I want to go here. - That's just crazy. (whip cracks) - Get on with your work! - Hurry up! - Come on, get a move on! Faster! - You, work hard harder! Move it! Come on, move! I told you to get a move on! - Hmm. (suspenseful music) (taps quietly) - Hurry. - How's it going? - We're almost there. We'll be through in two days. (suspenseful music) - Allen. This month, we made a deal with Mr. Wu. But only six of our prisoners seem worth the trouble, and they have families who want them back. We're in close contact of course. We keep hoping. This is a taste of the profits. - [Guard] Sir. - What's wrong? - Donna Yang, she's dying. - No one can die without my permission. You remember that her father, he used to be a diplomat. She's useful to me. Helen, check her out. (suspenseful music) - What's the matter? - It's her. She won't eat. - Hmm? Dying, huh? Hmm. You won't die here! (laughs) - Wait. Who's in charge of her? - Me. - Miss Yang, you're not allowed to die yet. You see, you don't have permission. Vulture. - Hmm. - You know what to do. - Yeah. - Miss Yang is our honored guest. Treat her well. Give her intravenous feeding. keep her alive. - Right. (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Guard] Hurry up! Hurry! (explosion bangs) - Come on, come on. Get back to work, all of you. Go on! - [Vulture] Is she dead? - Why did you do that? She was still alive! Look at her! You're just an animal! How can you get away with this brutal behavior-- (dramatic music) - Next. Next. - Hey. We must act sooner. - Why? - We've tunneled under the wire. - When? - Shh. (yelling) (ominous music) (laughs) - Bring me some food. Eat it! - Did Donna talk yet? Next time do the teeth torture. She's gotta talk then. - She's loaded with dope. Vulture shot her up. - Good, I enjoy mind-fucking. (dramatic music) (groaning) - [Lily] Terry, Terry, are you okay? - Yeah. - Lily, come here. Hurry up. Why were you talking to her? - She needed comfort. - Well, I don't trust her. She's stubborn and we don't need that. - But, remember, she's been very helpful to some of us since she's been-- - Enough! I don't want to hear it! - [Prisoner] Hey, don't get bitchy. She's not worth it. Don't you have anything better to talk about? It's boring. (suspenseful music) - Halt! Don't move! Don't move or I'll shoot! (alarms blaring) - Chief. - Who was on guard? - I was. - Call all prisoners to the yard. - [Vulture] Right. (ominous music) Everybody fall in! Come on! Into the yard, all of you! (shouting) Come on! Line up straight! - [Guard] Line up, all of you. Hurry up! Keep still and don't move. You there, quick! Hurry! Hold still! - I forgot to tell you, so listen now. You can't leave here alive unless you become invisible. Remember that! - No! No! No, please! No, don't kill me! No, please! Just shoot me then! Oh, no, please! Don't do this to me! Please, don't hurt me! Just shoot me! Please! Please! Please! (crying) (screaming) (laughs) (ominous music) - About turn! Move! (ominous music) (laughing) - No! No! - Come back! (yelling) (knocking) (suspenseful music) - It's been raining. There's been a landslide. - Ah, how stupid can anyone get! Why the hell didn't she allow for that new plan? Now it's harder. More damn guards. - And so what then? What should we do? - Uh, we'll leave as planned, tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Shh! (groaning) - What do you intend to do if someone does escape? - Give my life. - Good. (laughs) - This is painful. (yells) - No talking. - Bitch! I hate her! - Susan, be patient. It's only one more day. - Hey! - Dammit. Same girl again. - Stop faking. Get up! Up! - Ow! - Hey, please don't hit her. She really isn't well. - You shut up! Mind your own business. - Back to work, all of you. - Come on. Bitch! (yelling) (dramatic music) - Let me. Come on. Let me tell you something. You've got to shed blood to spy in here. (pensive music) - Terry, you can have this corner, if you insist, when it's free, if you're lucky. - But I want it right now, and I want it all the time. - No! - Stop. What for, one of the guards? - None of your business, but I want this corner permanently. - You come here! If you're looking for trouble, I'll really give it to you! - Just shut up and mind your own business. (shouting) - Don't start trouble now. Everybody's leaving here tomorrow, you know that! Stop it! Why do you want to spoil it, you stupid bitch? - I don't want to spoil it, I just can't stand her! (banging on door) - Let's go. - Let go of me! - Don't move! Lights on. Do you want to go to the yard again? You be quiet in here. - Hurry, and take care. - Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! - [Guard] Hurry! - [Guard] Come on, hurry up. (suspenseful music) - [Prisoner] Give me the light! (whistle trills) - Huh? - Attempted escape. Search everywhere. - Right. - Make way. - Hurry! - [Guard] Get away. (explosion bangs) (knocking) (dramatic music) (coughing) - Just two girls couldn't dig that tunnel by themselves. Talk! Who are your helpers? Talk! All right, I'll punish all of you. No more food for two days, work as usual! And you may not sit down for 24 hours. Remain standing. - Vulture, bring them here. - Yes. About turn! (whimpering) - You've got a nerve. Talk! Who helped you dig? You won't speak. Talk! Who are your accomplices? (dramatic music) I'm going to kill these women one by one until you tell me who helped you. Kill this one. (screaming) (mumbling) - [Minnie Voiceover] You'll pay for this, and you'll pay with your life. Your life! (laughs) - Move the bodies. The rest of you stand here till dawn. Nobody move. - About turn. Stand straight. (suspenseful music) (whistle trills) Fall in! - You just wait, I'll get you. - Sure thing. - Shut up and keep working. - Ow! - What do you think you're doing? - Look at that girl Terry Yu. She's as strong as an ox. She's probably the strongest girl here. No one can touch her. - Come on, hurry up. Come on. Hurry up! Go on. Get moving. Come on. Who do you think you are? - A telegram from Mr. Wu. (dramatic music) - Susan! - Hey! Don't kill her, that's our job. - You want to fight, right? I'm going to flog the loser. Go ahead. (grunting) - Hurry, catch up with the other team! Halt. Face front. - You will take a two minute break and go swimming in the ocean. Right, about face! March! (dramatic music) - Look, there's a fight. Let's go, come on. - Hey, break it up. Break it up! Come on, break it up. - God damn, it's you again! You're always in trouble. Take her to the cell. (suspenseful music) You don't seem to be settling in very well here. Well, you've had it easy, so now the real punishment begins. Go in! - No! (yelling) - Cover them up. (door clicks) - Hmm, Donna Yang? - Hmm. We've heard news. Her family's in America. They're willing to pay the ransom. - What about the microfilm? I thought that was what you wanted? - Let me tell you something that bothers me more than the microfilm. - What's that? - I've heard the Raiders are almost ready for action, and they shit hot. - Oh? Have they been trained by Tiger Chan? - Tiger Chan and Donna's father are old friends. If they find this camp, they'll wipe us out. It'll mean big trouble. - So what'll we do? - Sell Donna quickly. If we can get rid of her, she'll keep us out of trouble. - When's Wu coming? - Four or five days. - [Guard] Open up. - Get out. Get out! Do as I say or I'll pull you out! Hurry up! Come on! Out you get, now! Move it! Come on, come on! Hurry! (Vulture laughs) Drag them outside. - Yes. - Hurry. Bring a bowl of rice. Hurry up now. (groaning) First to the bowl gets the rice. (dramatic music) Hmm? (laughs) Before you get your rice, you must crawl over her. (laughs) (tense music) Hey, don't let her get away with it. I'm sure you can beat her. (laughs) (chatter) - The big one, the fat sum. Yeah. (aggressive music) (yelling) - I've got money riding on this, so do it, girl! - Hey, you, get back! Come on. - Come on, ladies! - Come on, I've got money on you! - Vulture, what are you doing? Only the chief decides who dies. Have you forgotten? Take them inside. - Hey, just luck. I'll take that. Hey, boys, come on. Let's go back, come on. Here's your money back. - You bitch! You let her win! I lost my bet! I'll kill you! Come on! (thunder crashes) - Give it. - I'll do it for you. - No need. I'll give you this rice bowl if you bark. You won't? Too bad. - Wait. I'll bark for it. - Go on. - Woof. Woof. Woof! - (laughs) Good dog. Come here! - [Guard] Yes. - Chief. Hello, Mr. Wu. - Why, Helen, long time no see. - Mr. Wu, shall we talk business? - Yeah. - 50 kilos of gold? But they're very rich. Why such a small amount? - Chief Wong, this war has been hard on everyone. 50 kilos of gold is all I could get. Don't worry, I know how to do my job. - All right. Let's go and have a look at her first. - Hold it, no need to hurry. Let's discuss my commission. Let's say 20/80, do you agree? - Mr. Wu, we're old business partners. You're being unreasonable. - Chief Wong, I'm in business to make money. This is dangerous work, you know. I risked my life coming here today. It seems a fair price to me. - Come on, let's go and see her. - Good. (suspenseful music) Hmm. She's exactly like her father. A real toughie. - William. - Yes, sir. - Give her more dope. - Right. (suspenseful music) - Where's Susan? - Hey, Terry! - Let go! - What are you doing? Let me go! - You can't escape like this. - Why not? Let me go or I'll kill you! (gun bangs) - Look! - After them! Quickly! There she is! Get her! - [Guard] Over there! - If you won't tell me, then by the time that dawn comes tomorrow, all of you die along with Terry Yu. Understand?! Take them! - [Guard] Go on! - You! Take that one to the Vulture. - Move it! Move it! (yelling) (whip cracking) Get in! - You know, there's only one way you can get your revenge. I know you hate her. You find out who that accomplice was. Anyway, you could save your own life should you be in danger. Vulture, I'll leave it to you. Don't you dare let me down. You found out who that accomplice was. - Right. (ominous music) Hmm. You made me lose money, now I'm gonna get my revenge. (laughing) - No! - Oh! (yelling) - Who are you? - I'll tell you later. Just untie me now. - I won't untie you know. I'm gonna kill you, dammit, for all those other girls' deaths. You're not getting out. - You'll need my help. You can't escape otherwise. Is he there? - Mm-hmm. Ow! Ow! Get moving. - I gotta save someone. I'll see you in the parking lot in a minute. - Who the hell are you? - Never mind. (gasps) Donna? Oh my god. Donna. Let me get you out of here. Listen, Donna, I've been ordered to save you. (yells) Be quiet! Tiger Chan's told me to save you. You know Tiger Chan, right? - Oh, yeah. - Good. Well, let's go. Come on. (suspenseful music) Come on. Now, you wait here a minute. I won't be long. - But I'm scared. - You'll be all right, don't be afraid. Someone called Susan will come. Tell her I'll be right back, okay? (shrieks) - Who's Susan? I don't know her. - We're leaving. You want to come? Do you want to come? We're going. Hurry up. (suspenseful music) Hey, come here. Come on. (door clicks) - Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! - Listen up. No more noise, you got it? - Let me in. - Who is it? - Anyone can come with me. Better to die than to live like this. - But the guards-- - Oh, be quiet. Go on! - Huh, who's there? - Huh? - Shh. She's Donna Yang. It's my job to get her out of here. - What? - It's okay. Quick. - Go on, hurry. (engine roars) (guns firing) (sirens blaring) - Get those girls! - [Guard] This way, quickly! (screams) (grenade bangs) - Come on! - Huh? - Sir! - [Chief Wong] What is it? - [Guard] Sir, Terry Yu's stolen a truck and escaped. - What?! And Donna Yang? - She's gone too. - Where the hell was Vulture?! - He's been wounded, sir. - Right. You better find them before they get off the camp, so hurry up! (dramatic music) It's difficult to get over those mountains alive. I can't see why they chose that route anyway, to tell you the truth. Fatty. - Yes? - Go back to camp. Organize a full search tomorrow. - Yes, sir. Come on. - You remember what you said if someone escaped from your control. - Relax. If it proves necessary, I'll pay with my life. - Hmm. - Hmm. - Who are you? And Donna Yang, why is she so important? - I belong to the Raiders, and I've got to get her out of here. - Ah, it was you. Did you save the diplomat's daughter? - We're still in camp territory now. We've got to get out of here. Hurry. Be careful. Careful. Come on. - Ow! (screaming) (guns firing) - Get away! Hurry! - Never mind, we've got to leave her. (guns firing) - Quickly. - Allen, quick. Come on. - Hey, look at this. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (grenade banging) (guns firing) - Oh, shit, I'm out of ammo. Come on. Oh, no, it's a waterfall. - Oh, god, what now? - [Guard] Hold it, don't move! - We got 'em all. - Over the waterfall! - Huh? - Look out, the chief is gonna be here soon. - Come on. Come on, move it. - Come on, let's go. - Come on. Ah, so you're the one who left the clue. (dramatic music) - Chief! (screams) (guns firing) - Quick. Come on, jump! (screaming) - God damn it. - (laughs) Who would have guessed it? Even precious Helen is a traitor. Maybe she was sent by Tiger Chan to spy too. It certainly looks like it. - We can't let anybody know this camp exists. We've gotta catch 'em. - Hurry. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Donna, you'll be all right, don't worry. Come on. - No, I'm dying. - Oh, Donna. No, Donna. Donna, you've got to tell me, where did you hide the microfilm? Where is it, huh? - I dropped it. - (gasps) You dropped it? Where? - Oh, no! Donna! - She's dead! - Where the hell did she drop it? Shit. (screaming) - I'll kill you! Why are you trying to stop me? - Leave it! So just as I thought, you are Jade. - Mm-hmm. - They said you were killed two years ago, but they were wrong. - Tiger Chan wanted information about the camp. Well, I've got it for him, and we'll expose the place. - What do you mean? - Well, she's my comrade. She's one of the Raiders. - Ha, not as far as I'm concerned. She's still Killer Helen to me! - Terry, what's our mission? - Well, I was ordered to save Donna and get the microfilm out to the free press. I failed. - At least I can join the Raiders again. - Let's retreat to the mountain. We can make our plans up there. Come on. - Right. Come on. (suspenseful music) - Come closer. Feel better? - Yeah. You're terrific. I've heard that the Raiders are hot stuff. I'm glad I got to meet you both. You're really great. - Don't worry, Terry is with us. The queen of the jungle. We'll be fine. - You should rest now. We've got a long way to go. Come on. (dramatic music) The fire. - [Mr. Wu] I know this area quite well. I'm an expert. That mountain over there is quite overgrown. Helen would definitely operate from there. If we go on for a bit, we'll find where their headquarters are. - Mr. Wu, do you mean the headquarters of the Raiders? - Mm-hmm. - Well, then, what are we waiting for? - Remember, if Miss Donna gets killed, I lose all my profits. - All we've got left is the microfilm. That's worth much more, isn't it? - Hmm. Come on. (suspenseful music) - Come on, hurry. Come on. (yelling) - Hurry! Jump! Quick! This way! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - Let me go! Let me go! No, let me go! - Shut up! Shut up! (gun bangs) - Hold it! - Get rid of her. I'm gonna kill all these bitches! - Okay, okay-- - Hey, hey, not yet. We're heavily outnumbered. Come on, go back. Come on, quickly! (suspenseful music) (footsteps approaching) - Are you all right? - Minnie! She's wounded. - I've been shot. - She's got a fever. - We'll have to get the bullet out. (groaning) - Ah, there it is. (groaning) It's all right, it's nearly over now. It's okay. I'm being as quick as I can. You're doing well. It's okay. You're doing well. Nearly finished. Okay. - Tell me, prisoner, was this escape premeditated? Speak! Are Helen and Terry on the same team? Did they tell you that? Talk! Well, so you don't want to talk now. So you'll never speak again! Vulture. - You god damn murderers. Even though you're going to burn me to death, I'll come back and haunt you, you miserable bastards! (laughing) (screaming) (frantic music) - Follow me, come on. Oh, god. Let's not go all the way back to headquarters. Tiger Chan understands. Come on. Help her, come on. Hurry! Come on. - Is he here? - Yeah. You follow me. Come on. (dramatic music) Captain! - Huh? - Hello, Captain. - That's amazing. How did you get out of there? - I had to help Terry, so. - Oh. Where's Donna? - She's dead. I failed in my task. - And the microfilm? - Hmm. And you? You've been planted there for two years. Did you manage to get hold of the microfilm? - No. - Hey, Tiger, where are the others? - Most of them have been killed. Someone's trying to blacklist us and stop us working. No one dares employ us, so we had to disband. (laughs) That's how it is. Sad but true. The boat's just coming. Let's go and wait for it. (engine chugging) - There it is. - [Women] Hey! Hey, right here! Over here! This way! Quickly, quickly! Come on! (dramatic music) (laughs) - Arrest them. You're all under arrest. Go on! - Move it! Move out of here. Move! Come on, come on! - Go! - Get in! (laughing) (yelling) - I'll stab you in the back too, you bastard! (guns firing) - [Chief Wong] Come on! (yelling) Helen! You've got no chance, so give up now. - Have you got the film? - I hid it. I put it in my leg. (dramatic music) As soon as we found Donna. I knew it immediately. It was the microfilm. So I searched her and found it. Then I sewed it into my own flesh. - I don't understand. Why didn't you say yes when Tiger asked you? - Because Minnie and Lily were there at the time. Later I realized the truth. Tiger's hands were too clean. - No one wanted to employ us anymore. We had to disband. - I looked at his hands while I was listening. Terry, look at your hands. They're covered with blisters and scratches, like all of ours. Tiger Chan, his hands were all smooth and clean, even manicured. (guns firing) - Helen, you get out! I promise I won't kill Terry. - Take everything and move quickly. - I can't, no! - Go when I shout. Now! - No! - I'm coming! (grenade bangs) (dramatic music)
