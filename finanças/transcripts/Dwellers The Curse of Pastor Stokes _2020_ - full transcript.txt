Thank you, nurse. Bishop Taylor... it's Pastor Stokes. Pastor. I'm sorry, Bishop, for waking you, I just wanted to check on you. No, no, you don't have to sit up. My days are numbered, son, but you already know that. So, why are you really here? There have been things going in the church. Things? It's... it's hard to explain without sounding like a crazy person. Tell me what's going on, son. Some of the members have left the church. That happens, you know, sometimes you just have to... Demonic spirits. Bishop, have you ever dealt with a demonic spirit? Why do you ask, why do you ask, Pastor? These people, they've come to me asking for help. Help? Yes, help, they're experiencing demonic activity in their homes, their lives. - Dwellers. - Dwellers? Yes. They sit and prey on the weak, the ones who have lost faith, either in the church or themselves. Have you ever wondered what happens to the demons, that people exorcize, when they come to church? When they fully start believing in God, then all the demons they've been fighting leave them. Those demons dwell in that church looking for the next, the next weak person to terror, to terrorize. You have to leave now. Pastor. There's a reason why they're coming to you. Look deeper into. ♪ I don't care who you think you are ♪ ♪ You might be shining on a superstar ♪ What are you doing?

Hey, listen, I've got to tell you something. Something really, really messed up just happened. Just hear me out, it's going to sound crazy. I just, I just don't know where to start. Everyone thinks I'm crazy, I'm not crazy. It's okay, just take a deep breath. Close your eyes. Tell me what happened. Mm, Travis, stop it. Travis, I said st... Travis? What is that? Babe, what's wrong? I don't know, I, I, I, I just saw something, I saw her! Saw what? The... I... I saw a girl, I saw a girl right there. She was standing on the edge of the bed and she was tickling my feet. Hey now, don't, don't you dare look at me that way, I'm not crazy, I know what I saw. Babe. - Babe. - Oh, shit. I'm sorry if I woke you, are you okay? Yeah, babe, I'm alright. It's okay, babe, I got to get up anyway. - What? - I told them I'd be in early today. No, no, no, can you stay today and then tomorrow morning go to work early, please? Like special please. Tomorrow I'm taking off, remember? Right, I forgot. Yeah, but I'm going to come home for lunch. Yeah, and I'm going to go to the grocery store. - Mm-hmm? - And cook a nice dinner. Dinner, okay, for once, okay, well, you know what, it sounds like I got a good boyfriend. - Really? - What? A good boyfriend, just, just good? That's what I just said, right? - Okay then. - Well, listen... well, from what I hear, I'm a great boyfriend. Please, okay, don't hype this up, alright? You aight. I'll see you a little later. Okay. Have a good day. Hello? Excuse me, can I help you? Good afternoon, Pastor. I see you're keeping busy? Tell me, what's your time frame for returning to the church? I don't think I'm ready yet. Well, you're the Pastor, people are going to start to worry about you, I mean, I'm starting to worry about you now. Psalms 55:22, cast your worries on the Lord and he will sustain you. Yeah, that's the truth. So, tell me, what's this all stuff about? What is a dweller? You know how as people, we all battle our own demons internally? Yeah. Sometimes that battle manifests itself as a spiritual dweller within. So you're saying our personal demons can turn itself into a spiritual presence? Yes, and that spiritual presence will attach itself to you and it'll do anything to control your life. Basically, they try to become you? Yes, look at Evelyn. Her spiritual presence has been dwelling in her home. I can't believe how cold it's getting already. I kept the windows to my bedroom open all day. Oh, gosh, you're so dramatic. Well, sister, I'm tired, I have a long day tomorrow, like a ton of meetings. Why, so I can be a stay at home mom like you? No, thanks. Goodnight. Love you, bye. Shit. Leave it open. Are you okay, Mommy? Hmm. And why do they come to you? I'm still trying to figure that out. They all used to be members of the church. Hmm, well, now that you say that, I do remember a couple of them. Yeah. There's one thing that's very strange though, every single person who had one of these episodes gave me a piece of a photo. Tried to put it together yet? Yes, but it's just not registering to me yet. I don't know, I'll figure it out soon enough. Right. So, what does the wife think about all this? You haven't been home much. It's a battle every day. She just doesn't understand, you know. Well, I feel the same way, I need you at the church, I can't do this by myself. Do you remember that talk that Bishop Taylor gave us at our university? "You guys are doing great here at the university, you have very bright futures being young pastors in a church that needs your strength, but I see where you can fail. Stop trying to save the world and save a person, then that person can save a person and so on." That's what I'm trying to do. The world can't be saved, only the people can. Yeah, I understand, I got your back. Hey, don't forget, we have a baptism to do - in a couple of days. - Got it. This is Pastor Stokes, day ten. Still no answers. Dear Heavenly father... ...I... It's almost time, Pastor. Oh, yeah, I almost lost track of the time. So, who is getting baptized? This is Sophia. She had an interesting experience. What? You're crazy. In your dreams. My room is a mess. You know what, as a matter of fact I'm going to call you right back after I take a shower, get my life together. Okay, bye. Get it together, Sophie. Get it together, Sophia. You're going to die. Can you imagine that happening to you? I don't want to. - We have a long day ahead of us, Pastor. - Yeah. Hey, come here, let me drape you. Thank you. You know... I'd want to be baptized too. Did they ever mention why they left the church, Pastor? Something evil influenced them all to leave. What else could it be? Why do people leave the church? They leave because the word of God is no longer affecting them. They turn to people or money to solve their problems. These spiritual demons feed off of that. Hmm. So, what's your plan, Pastor? What are you looking to achieve with all of this? Do you really think you can help these people? Past couple of weeks I've been wracking my brain. To be honest, Ali, I'm trying to figure out how I can actually help these people. I know nothing about exorcism... but what I do know... is that these people were chosen, and somehow so was I. In their minds, they believe that I'm the one who can help them. So with God's blessing... I'm going to do everything in my power to do it. Hmm. I can say one thing, they're in good hands. As you go into this water, I consider that Jesus took up a human body and himself was baptized, that I cannot even baptize myself, much less save myself, that the water only washes bodies. But Christ washes consciences, and it is only in him that you have hope of passing through the waters of judgment. As you rise from the water, I consider that Jesus raised himself from the dead of his own power. That he washed you from the guilt of your sin, that he has broken the power of sin in your life. Sophia! Sophia, are you okay, Sophia? Sophia! Are you alright? Sophia, are you okay? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You're okay, it's okay, it's okay. Pastor. Why are you still here? I'm, I'm leaving soon, I just... one more thing. Go home to your wife, all this will be here tomorrow. - Your wife won't be home if you keep sleeping here. - You're right, you're right. Go home, get some rest. Let me put my eyes on this a little, see what I can come up with. - Go. - Okay. Thanks. Honey, I haven't seen you in days, the least you could do is come to bed. Please? Thank you. You know, I shouldn't have to compromise with you. I love you. Hmm, well, you have an awful funny way of showing it. I promise. It will be better soon. We'll see. Hello. Pastor? Pastor Stokes, is this you? Yes. Trisha, Trisha Charles. Hi, Trisha, are you... you okay? No, I need your help. Shut up, bitch. Shut up. - Pastor, I need your help. - Hello. What are you saying? Shut up. Shut up, die, die! In the name of the Holy Spirit, I rebuke the evil. Who was that, hmm? This woman that used to be a member of my church. Okay. What did she want? I don't know. What are you doing? - I have to... - Jonathan! I have to just check something. Jonathan, you promised. Trisha, oh, my God! What, what are you doing? Trisha. Oh, my God, are you okay? - Are you okay? - Ow, no. What's the matter, Trisha? Oh, my God! Trisha. Here, here. It's okay, it's okay, just tell me - how I can help you. - I'm sorry. - Pastor. - It's okay. Just tell me how I can help you. This has been going on for the past few weeks, I wake up with bruises that are unexplainable. I'm sorry, I have to cut you off, but can I please record this, I promise it'll help you and me both. Okay. I set up cameras in my living room. Is this... this is it, the footage? Play. Back up is en route. Okay. Are you okay? I can't promise you that it's going to get any easier... but let me ask you a question... who were those voices on the phone with you? What are you talking about? Trisha, you called me right before you... came to my house. Dang it, let me see, five, six people. - What's going on? - Hey, Pastor. Have a seat, have a seat. Look, I've been up all night trying to put this into perspective. - Let's do a lesson. - No, seriously hear me out. Alright, the things these people have in common, right? One, they all come from our church, two, they all had the same paranormal attacks, and three, all their names have six letters. Right, these are things I already put together. Right, six, six, six, six, six. Six. - She came to me last night. - Another one? She even has a video of what happens to her. I was going to suggest a hoax. - A hoax? - Yeah, a hoax, I mean, is this all too coincidental? Six people, all their names all have six letters. It's been happening to me too. What's been happening to you? As I look deeper into these things... I've been seeing and hearing stuff. What do you mean, stuff? One night... my wife woke up. Jackie? Honey... what are you doing? Jaclyn! Jaclyn! Jaclyn? Jonathan? Jonathan, what's wrong? Oh. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Seriously! What is it? It all felt so real. Listen, I'll continue with this. Go see Bishop Taylor, I went to see him, he's not doing well. I don't think he'll be here much longer. I hate to see him when he's like this. - Yeah. - You know, the last time I saw him, he was trying to tell me something important. Yeah. What was he telling you? He was explaining to me how the demons sit and prey on the weak. Sit where? In the church. You keep working, I'll be back soon enough. Pastor Stokes. How's he doing? He's dying, Pastor. I'm glad you're here, Pastor. You asked me if I ever dealt with a demon before, I have. Today is a new day. Today God has his hands above you. Today none of your problems matter, the only thing that matters is your faith in God, - someone say amen. - Amen. If you believe that Christ died for our sins, if you believe that God's plan is better than your plan, if you believe that evil will never trump God, then line up next to me. Let me put my hands above you... let the Holy Spirit enter your life. Amen. How's everything, everything good? Bless you. It's so good to see you. So nice of you to come. Let us pray. The Lord is our shepherd. That day I had to make a decision, I had to decide if my faith was strong enough to fight something so powerful. I decided to fight it myself. Do you know your Bible, Pastor? Yes. Your heart was proud because of your beauty, you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground, I exposed you before Kings to feast their eyes on you. Ezekiel: 28 verse 17. No temptation has overtaken you, that is not common to man. God is faithful and he will not allow you be tempted beyond your ability, but with temptation, he will also provide the way of escape. 1st Corinthians: 10 verse 13. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. Bishop, what are you trying to say? You cannot share the Lord's table with a demon! Nurse! Someone's close! Johnny. Johnny, boy. Come to me, Johnny. Come to me. Come see me, Johnny. Help me. You just don't get it. Come with me. How's your faith, Pastor Stokes? Why do you ask? You don't look too confident in yourself. What do you think I don't get? Everything you've learned. You've been mislead and manipulated. I guess you've got a different version of the truth. Is that what you seek? The truth is you've been taught Lucifer is a man. What if that was a lie? You see, I was married for 30 years. My husband didn't have much, but when I left, I took a third of what he had. Do you really think a fight between two men so massive wouldn't be because of a woman? Eve was created from the rib of Adam, the ribs are some of the most fragile bones in the body and yet they protect the most important thing, your heart. Eve made Adam eat the forbidden fruit and yet... God never punished her. I won't allow your manipulation. Do you not believe? Let me restore your faith. Who are you? Help. Help. Help. Help me, Johnny. Who are you? In the name of the Father, state your name. Bishop Taylor told you the story of the six people that came to him in the church. He tried to save us all. Some of us didn't make it. No! Stay away from it! She can't be saved, but you can. In the name of the Father, state your name! In the name of the Father, state your name! In the name of the Father... state your name! Proserpine. You have to leave now! Ali, listen, I need you to look up something for me before I get there. No, listen to me, listen, I need you to find out everything you can on the demon named Prosperine. Yes, I'll, I'll explain when I get there, I'll be there soon. Okay, bye. Right, this is what I found on Prosperine. These are the most powerful female demons, Bishop Taylor mentioned something about preying on the weak... this demon preys on the weak, Pastor. Demogorgon, Lilith, Batibat, Jilaiya. They're all powerful, but the most powerful of them all is Succubus. Maybe we can run that past Bishop Taylor. He's dead. What do you mean, he's dead, in his sleep? I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than that. Prosperine... is that why you asked me to look it up? Um... Bishop Taylor confessed a dark secret to me about Bethel Baptist. Secret? - He was performing exorcisms. - Where, at the church? I believe both in his house and here at the church. Then why wouldn't he tell us? Tell us what, that he was releasing evil spirits from people? Something. Would that have stopped you from becoming a Deacon? No. Me neither. That's why I don't go home at night, this is what I signed up for, the people in our church need me, they need us. What are you looking for? A bag. What do you need that for? When I was at Bishop Taylor's house, I saw things. I'm listening. In his room, in Bishop Taylor's room. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Pastor, this just sounds crazy! Ali. Ali, the answers to all my questions may be in that house somewhere. And what are you going to do, just break into the Bishop's house? No, we are. Pastor, there's got to be a better way. There's no time for another way. Look, I'll FaceTime you right now, so I'll be with you the whole time. Fine. Hey, man, be careful. Thanks, Ali. Pastor? Yeah, Yeah, it's open. Okay. Okay. Hey, be careful, man, be careful. Okay, I'm in, I'm in. Good. Good. Alright, I'm in the room. Okay, do you see anything? No, nothing yet. Okay, let's see. Uh... - Be careful, brother. - Thank you. Nothing yet. Hurry up, let's make this quick, we've got to get out of here. Pastor. - Hey, you still there? - Yeah, I'm here, Ali. I haven't found anything yet. It's just... it's just Bishop Taylor's stuff. - Do you see anything? - Hang on. I think I found something, give me a second. Just hurry. Ali, you can read Latin, right? Yeah. Okay. Um, I'm going to show you this on the FaceTime. Okay. - What does this say? - Uh, it says, "The demons are taking over my body." Pastor, I think this is a journal. Yeah. Okay, um... What does this say? Uh... Put it closer. It says I will be the death of you. Johnny. Pastor, what's wrong. Hey? Nothing, nothing, I, uh, I just... I thought I heard something. I think it's time to leave, grab a couple of notebooks, we can analyze them tonight. Pastor, behind you! Pastor, behind you! Pastor! Pastor! - Ali! - Pastor! Pastor, Pastor! Where did she go? Where, where is she? - Are you, are you okay? - Yeah, are you alright? Yeah. We've got some great material to review. There were so many notebooks and files, I wish we could have gotten them all. Ali. I never saw anyone possessed before. I mean, all these years of studying... and preaching the word of God... I truly never believed demons exist. I understand why you're so obsessed with helping these people. Now I'm obsessed with getting answers. Well, we've got a lot of tapes to review. No, no. Go home. There's so much to do, I, I can't go home. Go home to your wife, Pastor, she deserves a little bit of your time. I'll look at this stuff tonight. And we can start over in the a.m. I found this in the Bishop's bed. Hiya, honey. Can you tell I'm happy to see you? Look, I understand, but even if I told you what was happening, you wouldn't even believe me. You know what, Jonathan, you're right, I wouldn't believe you, but do you know what I do believe? I will honor, love and respect you, I will never put anything before you. And I will never leave you. You know where I got those words? Our wedding vows. And I mean every word. Every single word. You know what, I don't know how much more I can take of this, okay? I come home every day to an empty house and an empty bed every day, every day! Every day, it's weighing heavy on my heart, - I can't do this. - Jackie, I promise, I promise... this will soon be done. Just give me a little more time, I'm so close, I'm so... Just, just, just, just stop, just stop, you don't get it, you don't get it. Jackie, Jackie. Just, you don't get it, Jonathan. My description of demons is, persons without bodies. It's very important to realize you're dealing with a... Everyone, hold hands. Close your eyes and focus! Focus on the forces that bring your demons out. Keep your eyes closed, fo... Why's the lights out? Strange. Ali? What are you doing here? Pastor. I was trying to get myself together. Do you want to talk about it? No. I think I found what you're looking for. What is this? I want to thank you all for coming here tonight. I know that reflecting on what you're going through can be hard. Wait, this is why we're here? - I thought you said this was going to be a prayer service. - Yeah. - Right. - It is. Ever since I received phone calls from each one of you, I've been trying to figure out what was happening to you, there's a reason that you contacted me, and I'm going to do everything in my power to try and help you by the grace of God. Okay, Pastor, but how is this going to help me? - Us? - Yeah. - Exactly - Yeah. 20 years ago, Bishop Taylor faced the same challenges, some of the people from the church came to him. So, they were like us? No, they were much worse. Worse, you mean it can actually get worse? When the possession actually starts to kick in. That's what happened to those people, the demons already started taking over their bodies, Bishop Taylor could only do so much. I feel like it's already trying to take over my body. They are, but that's why we're here, I think we all can help each other. How? Tonight we're going to try to open the door, so that the demons can walk in. - What? - Wait, what? I need to know which demons are dwelling, so that we can know how to help you. But this is crazy, I don't want to do this! Please, we're running out of time. Trust in me, trust in us. Trust that the Lord has my back. Okay, so... what do we do now? Alright, everyone, join your hands in prayer like mine. I want everyone to channel your energy and thoughts to this exact place, when the demon comes to you. Focus on your thoughts, whatever you do, do not open your eyes. Repeat after me... I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil! Focus, don't let them break your focus. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. Don't look. Do not let it break your concentration! I will fear no evil. - I will fear no evil. - The Lord is walking with you in this. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I've lost. I'm sorry. I can't do this! Pastor. Sophia. Please help me. - Sophia. - Help me. Sophia! Sophia! Do you think tonight was a failure? At this point, Pastor, I don't know what's a failure or success. I'm looking at life through a totally different lens now. What I do know, is I think we've opened a door, that can't be shut, now that I'm worried about. We can't let our faith be shaken. The Lord chose us for a reason we're going to figure this out together. Absolutely, we always do. Alright. I know, I know. Hi, honey. Okay, on my way. Where's my beautiful wife? Jaclyn. Honey. There she is. You know, I've tried, I've tried for so long to look past things about you, Jonathan. Jackie. I knew what I was getting into when I signed up for this... but I thought it was going to get better! Listen, I understand exactly how you feel. I... honestly I feel terrible about it. You have no idea how this feels, none! Got it! I do know, but I don't think you understand, I made a commitment, Jackie, a commitment to God. You made a commitment to me, which you have not fulfilled! Look at you! You can't even have a decent conversation with me without looking at that fucking phone of yours! I can't do this anymore, I just can't. What are you saying? I'm saying we can't be anymore. Jackie, until death do us part. Yes, I know. You're going to die. I ended my vow with those words in front of the church, that made me the man that I am today, I can't change who I am, Jaclyn. You married a man of God. I surrendered my life to him, so I have to help these people. All you care about is helping those people! But who's going to help you? Her name is Jaclyn. How long have you been working with her? Not long. You mentioned there being five other kids. Yes, but she's the most intriguing of them all. How so? I was hoping with your experience, you could tell me. How long have you been doing this? Bishop, I know I look young, but I've been doing this for about 15 years. This sort of thing is personal for me. Doctor... do you understand Latin? Yes, why do you ask? Is that what she's writing? I believe so. Okay, well, let me engage with the child and see if I could be of help. Wait. Be careful. Hi, Jaclyn. I'm Dr. Roberts, how are you? What are you writing? Can you tell me what this sentence says? Sure. You're going... to die. Did it hurt, does it hurt, Dr. Roberts? Stop! You're so weak. You have no power over me, Bishop. - I warned you. - What? Where are you going, Jonathan? No more cooking. Jackie? I, I can help you. It's too late, Johnny. The church can help you. But who's going to help you? What's wrong, Johnny boy? The church can help us. What church? The church you stopped going to? The church that's based on lies and filled your head with false beliefs? The church that's built on a rock? Do you even know what the rock is, Johnny? I am a child of God. I will not let you shake my faith. We drive you from us, whoever you may be, unclean spirits, all satanic powers, all infernal invaders. In the name and by the power of Our Lord Jesus Christ, may you be snatched away and driven from the church of God! He who has built his church on the firm rock and declared that the gates of hell, shall not prevail against her... because he will dwell with her all days, even to the end of the world! In the name... God, the Father commands you! God, the Son commands you! God, the Holy Ghost commands you! Jaclyn. Jaclyn! Succubus! God, Lord. Please grant us. Shh! Easy, easy. Everything's going to be okay. - Everything's going to be okay. - What, what happened? You happened. What? Shh! Just go to sleep. Everything's going to be alright, we'll talk about it later. Get some rest, okay? I love you. And I love you too. Johnny boy.
