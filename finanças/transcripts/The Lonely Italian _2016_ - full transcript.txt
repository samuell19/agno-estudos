Are you ready to make-a me some pizzas? - Whoo! Yeah! - Yeah! Ready? Set. Begin! Do you believe this asshole? That was me. I come to America, and two weeks in this country, I got cast on an MTV reality show. I made women shove meatballs in their mouths. I made them suck the cream out of cannolis and spit it into a jar. Their parents too. I was offensive to my culture, and I was a dick to women. But who cares? I was famous! People threw money at me just to show up at their parties and act like an idiot, and women wanted to ride me like a Vespa scooter. I was on top of the world. But just like that, it was all over. No more parties. No more TV shows. No more women riding me like a Vespa scooter. But it's okay. I don't do this reality stuff no more. I'm not interested in putting myself in strange vaginas. I'm ready to love and to be loved. But it's impossible to meet women now. Look at them! They keep staring at their cell phones and computers and shit, and they don't look at the world around them so they can see a semi-good-looking Italian guy who wants to talk to them. This is very sad for me, for my heart, and for my balls. Is that for here or to go? To go, please. ♪ Why does nobody want to love me? ♪ ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ ♪ Dame un helado derritiéndose ♪ ♪ Simple, yes, my friend - Who are you? - I'm Julie. I'm Julie Spira. I'm a digital matchmaker and an online dating expert, and I'm going to help you find love online. What kind of picture should I take to have people that are gonna be interested in me? Okay, first of all, you should post three to five photos. That's my magic number. No more, no less. Less, people think you're hiding something. Maybe you're fat and you're not showing your whole body. People want to see full-length shots. Your primary shot just needs to be a close-up. Should I hold my belly in or... You shouldn't wear a T-shirt that says "sex"... - Oh, that's a friend of mine. - Okay, on your profile. Yeah, no. Not a good idea. Okay. So this is because then I'm gonna give the wrong impression. Well, then they're gonna think you're on the wrong site. - Makes sense. - Okay. So let me show-- these are the pictures that I'm actually having. - Let's see. - Okay. I'm not technological. Okay. Right here. It's... And loading. Still loading. I just renew the contract with Sprint. They locked me for another two years, and I never get reception, so if I'm about to die and I have to call 911, I will die 'cause of Sprint. Um... - These are the pictures. - Okay. I actually have five on this. Oh, my gosh. No way. - That's my side. - Oh, no, no, no. And that's a very sexual-- I used, like, 75 filters to make me look unbelievable. I mean, I would wonder, like, how many piercings you have and if there's an ax in your back pocket. You are not putting that as a primary photo. - That is my primary photo now. - That's your primary photo? - It is. - You got to be kidding. No, no. That's a primary photo. You got to change it. Show me the next picture. So this is in a T-shirt. I just went to the Rolling Stone concert. Oh, I loved the Rolling Stones concert. I went too. Wasn't that great? It's a selfie. I would crop it so we don't really see the bed so much and it's more you, because you're wearing a tongue, and there's a bed in the background. It's very sexual. Which I usually wear, like, not really tongues but, like, very tight underwear. - Okay. Next picture. - Oh, let me see this. And here I'd actually wrote, "I just bought my first jet." That was the thing that I wrote. - Yeah, but then you're lying. - Yes, I am. Definitely lying 'cause it was, like, $50 million. Well, you can't lie and say, "I bought the jet," because a woman's gonna think you really have the jet, and it's like, a guy that stands in front of a Ferrari on his profile photos, it's usually his neighbor's car. - Yeah, that makes sense. - Women are hip to that. No. You can't use that. And then it's me drinking wine. Huge passion, as Italian, for wine, and that's a very sexy face that I'm doing while I'm enjoying. - It's very sexy face. - Deep. It's a deep face. Like the wine that I'm drinking. I love this photo. This photo is an absolute yes. - Who are you? - My name is Dr. Andrea Kasper. I have a recent PhD in sociology from UCLA, and I have an online radio show called "Get Together with Dr. Andrea Kasper." Oh, I see. Is online dating just for people who wants to fuck right away? Because this is not what I'm looking for. I mean, of course I want to fuck, but I would love to have, like, a nice romantic dinner first. Something not too expensive, obviously. $30, $40 per person, with gratuity. I think that individuals need to think about how they want to comport themselves in a different way sexually. If someone is only interested in sexual relationship and you're not, maybe it's appropriate to have a conversation with her about what she's interested in and what you're interested in. So should I introduce myself to these women and say, "When you want to fuck?" And if they say, "Right away," then I know that they're not the right girls for me. I would prefer if you didn't use profanity with me. Should I use, like, technical words? - No. Just use, like-- - Scientific words? No, like--no, you can just say "have sex with." - Technical words. - No. "Have sex with" is fine. - Like "intercourse," perhaps? - No, "have sex with" is fine. - Okay. - It's fine. I just-- I don't want to use profanity, because I'm a professional, so... I won't. Let's say I go online and I see this woman and like her a lot and when I meet her, she has funny eyes. One eye goes this way. The other eye goes the other way. What should I do in this case? Should I split my time equally and look at one eye at a time, or I should I just look in the middle? My research doesn't focus on that, so I think I would really like it if you would just stick to what's relevant to this, okay? So there are a lot of websites out there. Which one do you think is the right website for me? Well, I think it depends on what you're going for. I mean, there are sites that cater to every individual. There are sites that cater to people who like salads, who like hot sauce, and there are sites that cater to every niche. There are also sites that cater to different demographic groups-- Jewish people, Christian people, African-American people. So there's sites for everybody, really. It just sort of depends on what you're looking for. So do you think if I go online, am I gonna be successful to find love? - I can't answer that question. - Do you find me attractive? N--that's not an appropriate question. I'm not here to-- it's an inappropriate question. I mean, as a human being, do you think I'm a good-looking guy? Listen, I'm an online dating expert. I can't assess you physically. I'm not. You're saying I'm not. No. No, I'm not gonna answer that question. - Are you single, perhaps? - Again, irrelevant. Well, I really want to thank you, Doctor, for having me here today. I really learned a lot. So thank you so much for having me. Ask me the next question. "What kind of pubic hair do you prefer on your partner?" Human. Next question. "How much time do you spend masturbating?" Weekdays or weekends? - It doesn't say. - Next question. "If a clone was made of you, would you sleep with it?" Wait, do you mean a clone of me with a pussy? It doesn't say. I mean, with a pussy, yes. Without a pussy, yes. Okay. "Under the right circumstances, would you allow a partner to lick your anus?" Is this a real question? It's--that's what it says. It's disgusting. I mean, of course yes, but don't say yes. Otherwise I'm just gonna get nasty girls who takes, like, penicillin all the time. Say no. - Someone is contacting you. - Already? That's amazing. "Hello. I saw your profile. "Would you be interested in getting together sometime? Smiley face. Carolyn." She's cute. Good thing I didn't say I like my butt to be licked. - How's everything going? - Good. How are you? You look very nice, by the way. - Thank you. - I see. I see. - Do I look like you expected? - Yeah. Well, you look pretty much - like your picture. - Yeah. Have you ever dated an Italian before? Like, have you been going out with an Italian, or... No. No. I've been to Italy, though. So what made you go online? One of my friends was telling me about it. You know, I was bored one night, and I was like, "I'm just gonna try this," and then, you know, it's kind of-- it feels kind of like a game, and then you're like, "Wait, this is actually-- I could actually meet people this way." By the way, would you like to eat something? - Yeah. - What do you want to eat? That pizza smells good. So you have some sauce in your teeth. - Do I? - Yeah. A little bit. No, I'm kidding. Oh, I hate you. Oh, my God, you're the worst. Did you ever sleep with anybody that you met online? Um, I mean, I think--I think by meeting people online, then you can, you know, find people to date and start relationships. So yes. The answer would be yes. So you slept already with somebody? - I'm not gonna be the first? - From online, yes. No, like, you're not the first person. So you're already actually acknowledging that we're gonna sleep together? - Hello. - Hi. How are you? I'm good. - Oh, this is-- - Let me. It's hard to get out of there. No, this... It's okay. Mwah. Domenico. Nice meeting you. Aww, nice to meet you. Take me forever to-- I'm out of breath. It's a workout. I know. - You look beautiful. - Oh, thank you so much. Like, in person, you look-- honestly. Oh, that's so nice of you. Honestly, you look way better in person than in the picture. - You're very kind. - You like me already? - Of course. - Yeah? You're Italian. How could I not like you? - Where are you from? - I'm actually Italian as well. - What? - Only just--just a tiny bit. - Only 25 %. - Okay. - 25 % is from where in Italy? - Yeah. My family's from Calabria. What? That's where my family's from. - No way. - Yes. - Really? - Maybe we're cousins and we don't know. I know. - Well, my last name is Spaniolo. - Spaniolo? - Uh-huh. - Spagnola? Spaniolo. And so-- You don't want to know what "spagnola," - in slang, means. - What is it? Oh. You really don't want to know what "spagnola" means. - Oh, no. Is it derogatory? - No. Spagnola. You really want to know what "spagnola" means? - I do. - Are you sure? - This is Italian slang. - Okay. "Spagnola" means when you take your penis and you - put it into a woman's boobs. - Oh. You go up and down, up and down. Who are you? Oh, that's such a blunt question. David Wygant. 15 years of doing this-- teaching men how to be men, 'cause most men walk around with no balls, scared to death to approach or talk to a woman or flirt with a woman or claim a woman, and then I teach women how to be claimed, because basically we're just cavemen and cavewomen, right? We're a man. You want to go. You want to take a woman, pull her by the hair, pull her into your man cave, and do what you want with it, and women want to do the same thing back. Well, men don't know how to be men. So I teach men how to understand and navigate the scope of dating so they're able to be successful with women no matter what they choose. So I can technically pull a woman's hair in my house without getting arrested? Absolutely. Well, you know, the-- Come on. How many women you been with? They love the hair pulled, or they like to be choked or their butt slapped, right? I mean, what is it nowadays? You know why? Because women want their hair pulled and they want to be choked because most men aren't dominant enough. What do you think I should do on the first date? Where should I take her? I'm simple on a first date, okay? First off, like, I'm not a bankroll. I'm not feeding you. This isn't "feed the homeless." Most guys kind of wine and dine, and the fact of the matter, especially online, let's face the fact, she's got eight pictures up, right? If you're attracted to the ugliest version of those eight pictures, that's what she probably looks like. So she's not gonna be exactly what I think - that she's gonna be? - No, no, no. I call it the mental masturbation. You know, all of a sudden, you see her pictures and then she's really hot, and then there's always one picture there and you say to yourself, "Fuck, man. I hope she doesn't look like that picture." That's what she looks like. So you want to take her somewhere cheap. Otherwise you're bankrolling all these bad Internet dates. So what if I go to the date and she's actually extremely ugly? What should I do? Should I stay 20 minutes to be nice, or should I leave right away? No, you got to network for-- you got to network for pussy. Okay, this is where most guys make the biggest mistake in the entire world. She knows she's extremely ugly. Well, then again, every woman thinks they have good-looking friends, so she doesn't know she's ugly. What I do is, I'm really nice. I mean, I've had train wrecks. I remember one time I was dating, and this woman starts--I was in Brentwood sitting at a cafe, and this woman with a limp starts limping towards me, like--like--almost like-- you know, almost like-- like she had, like-- like, a--like, a-- like, a crowbar in her ass that was fucking on fire, you know? She all of a sudden-- and I look, and I go, "Oh, my God, the ugliest picture worse than I've ever imagined." She goes, "David?" And I almost felt like going, "Who? Who?" You know, just joking around. I gave her an hour and a half of my time 'cause for one, I realized she's a human being, okay? I gave her an hour and a half, and I was really sweet. Really nice to her, you know? And at the end, I looked at her, and I said, "You know what? You're an awesome woman. I just don't feel the chemistry." Three weeks later, I was shopping in Whole Foods. She was there. She had the most gorgeous friend. I walked over to her and gave her a big hug, and I went out with her friend. - Unbelievable. - You got to do that. 'Cause you never know what's gonna happen down the road, and most guys, unfortunately, they're always looking-- they're-- they're always looking with their dick at that moment, and to me, I look at women as, like, a stock portfolio. It's like a pussy portfolio. It's like, it doesn't matter what you meet today. It's how big is your pussy portfolio? Sometimes it's gonna pay off in the future. So should we make an actual pussy portfolio at home? Yeah. You can make a pussy portfolio. - Yeah. Absolutely. - To keep track. I mean, the Jewish women are fun. I mean, you get a Jewish woman over 35, and she becomes your whore. - Jewish woman? - Yeah. Jewish people are very serious, like Catholic women. Jewish women are the ones that you can-- They want their hair pulled. They want to be choked. They want you to jerk off on their face. You know, they're, like, the dirtiest women - in the entire world. - Unbelievable. Because they have, like, this sexual freedom. You got to read. What I always say, look at the pictures first. Always pick the-- if you're still attracted to the ugly version of her on the ugliest picture, imagine that's what she is. Avoid women that are out there partying with their friends, drinking, 'cause you're gonna get the dumb party girl, the one that becomes psychotic in bed. So avoid women that have alcoholic beverages in their pictures, right? So you can eliminate them. Secondly, you want to get rid of the "Hey, scumbag" woman. - "Hey, scumbag?" - Yeah. She's the "Hey, scumbag" profile. She'll write this. She'll list something. "Hey, scumbag, if you're one of those guys "that are married, don't contact me. If you're one of those guys," you know, "that don't want a relationship, don't contact me. "If you're one of those guys that don't want to have kids and a minivan in two years, don't contact me." And women will write that. That's the "Hey, scumbag" profile. So that's the woman that you basically want to contact and just fuck her and just be the scumbag just to her, because she deserves it. 'Cause she needs to be punished for that. Absolutely she needs to be punished. She's a bitch. You've got another profile too. You got the woman that's basically lining you up as Daddy right away. Usually they're, like, 34 to 42. "I'm at a stage in my life right now where I can't waste any more time." Basically she's telling you, "My eggs are cooking. "They're in the oven right now. I want kids. "I want to meet a man, and I want to throw him in a minivan and de-ball him immediately," and she just wants the guy that's just gonna, like, deliver that fucking sperm. It's, like, almost like, you know, "Hey, knock, knock." "Who's there?" "Sperm." You know. And then you got the single mother who will write, "I don't have time to date." Those are my favorite. The "I don't have time to date" profiles. What the fuck are you doing online? You don't have time to date? What are you doing here? - Makes sense. - "I don't have time to date. I thought I'd give it a try." And that leads to that next profile, the "I'm embarrassed to be on here" profile. So that's my favorite person. "I can't believe I'm on here." So then I'll write back to them, like, "I can't believe "I'm on here, either. It's so ridiculous. "I'm so embarrassed. We could tell people we met somewhere else. It's our secret," you know? It's like, some secret. I've already sent the link to 500 of my friends telling them I'm gonna go bang you tonight. I joined one or two more websites today. Pasta Roni. - Maybe three. - No, no. The other one. - Fine. Four. - Did you do Tinder? - What is Tinder? - Give me your phone. Hamburger Helper. ♪ You see a picture of a girl. If you like her, you swipe right. If you don't like, you swipe left. Oh, it's like a game. I like this. Only swipe right the ones you like. Why limit myself? This is amazing. It's like swiping vaginas! ♪ ♪ ♪ Now, I know you said "Blair" on, you know, the Tinder when I met you, like, while I was flipping. - Yeah. Right. - What's your actual name? - Blair. - Blair is a name? - Like, a female name? - Yeah. Well, it's both. It's both. It's a unisex name. 'Cause I thought it was, like-- like, a nickname or something. - No. It's my real name. - So when was the last time you went on a date with somebody online? - Yesterday. - What? Yesterday? It was just coffee. No wine involved. Who's this guy? - You don't know him. - No, I know. Meaning, like, where did you meet him, - on OkCupid or on Tinder? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. OkCupid. - Did you make out? - No. - Why not? It was a coffee date. I don't make out on first dates. Do you feel comfortable right now with me? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah? Fine or still a little... - I'm good. - Yeah? I mean, I don't know you, so it's not, like... But usually they say that, you know, at the beginning when you meet somebody, within the first, like, 30 seconds, you know already if you want to go out with somebody or not. - Oh. - What can you tell after, you know, this long that we've been talking to each other? I feel like I'm a little more conservative than you. Yeah? Could it be a problem, or... Maybe. So based on that, would you go out on a second date with me, or... Um, still thinking about it. Why are you thinking about it? Um... 'Cause I don't know if we're, like, totally compatible. It would be a free date. You don't have to pay for it. I'm taking care of the wine. Yeah, but I can't go out with someone just for free wine. Why would you say we're not compatible? I think we're very compatible. - Really? - Yeah. How? I'm a man, and you're a woman. And that's it? Pretty much. Then you--that basically means you're compatible with anyone. You sure you like me? You don't like me, don't you? - Yeah, you're nice. - Yeah? Should I give you a call, like-- when should I call you? Whenever you feel like you want to call. What about in an hour? Am I your type? Like, a lot, or... - Um, I don't really have a type. - Yeah. Yeah, but I like you. You seem like you're fun. - Yeah? - Yeah. You seem fun. - Can I have a hug? - Sure. All right. It was nice seeing you. It was a nice kiss. It was a nice one. Can I have another one? - No. - Fine. - Ciao, Domenico. - Hi. How are you? Ciao. How it's going? That's as far as my Italian goes. Like, am I the first guy that you go out from Italy, or... I did--I did, um... date a guy from Torino for a long time. - Torino? Really? - Mm-hmm. Oh. For how long have you been dating this guy from Torino? I was with him for two years. But this is the-- this is the number one rule. You're not supposed to talk about exes on dates. - Yeah? - Mm-mm. 'Cause he ended up no good, or... Well, it's just-- it's just a rule. You're telling me you're an experienced dater, like-- Not excessively. I don't like it to take over, you know, other priorities like work and things like that. I don't like to really-- you know, I've got a few hobbies that I devote time to. It's not just... - Like what? - I do a bit of stand-up comedy. - You're a funny girl? - I try to be, yes. I try to be. Very nice. Do you want to tell me a joke? Oh, jeez. I can tell you a joke, but that's not my joke. No. They're all rude. - Let me try to think of-- - Who cares? Tell me the joke. I'll tell you a rude joke? Okay. - Yes. - All right. I learnt one the other day from my mechanic. What happened to the penguin whose car broke down? That is a very good question. He went to the mechanic, and the mechanic said, "Looks like you blew a seal." And the penguin said, "Listen, you leave my sexual preferences out of this." The seal like the animal? That's funny. Thank you. Did you meet anybody, like, crazy, like... Oh, I've met so many crazies. You're not even... Anybody that tried to rape you on the first date or something? No. Nothing like that, but just different kinds of crazy. Okay, something you need to know about me: I'm really, really, really into true crime. - True crime? - Yeah. - Like, you would kill somebody? - No, no, no. - So you love murders? - Yeah, I love murders. Just putting it out there now. Do you actually wait for the next murder to come up? Kind of. - Really? - Yeah. Like, I don't wait for it, but if the new one comes up, the new big trial, I follow it. - I see. - Mm. So... - Yes. - I have something to say... - What? - That is very bad. - What? - Basically I have to pee so bad that it's insane. Go on. Off you go. No, because I know this park very well, and probably, like, the closest toilet is, like, half of a mile away. - Okay. - Is it bad that I have to pee? No. - So... - You'll forgive me if I go? I want to thank you for coming today. Um, I love it. I love it. That is the best out line I've ever heard. What do you mean? I really have to pee. I promise. - Do you want to come with me? - No, it's fine. No, like, you see that I get inside and you can hear it. That's fine. I'll be all right. - Yeah? - I'll be good. Yeah. It was really nice seeing you. - It was great to meet you. - Do you want to see me again? We've talked about exes, all right? We've talked about rape. We've talked about murder. And now you've got to piss. So... I think that's pretty good. How long did you spend in Afghanistan? - Two years. - How many years? - Two years. - Two years. Now, what happened in Afghanistan? Don't tell me you were single for two years in Afghanistan. No. Well, here's the thing. I only dated one Afghan guy. An enemy? You date an enemy? - I dated a terrorist. - You dated--for real? Really Taliban? You dated the enemy of the United States. - Yeah. Briefly. - This is scaring me. Do I have to call the CIA? I'm on their list already. You know, I hate when they put movies out there where the nanny hooks up with the husband because there's always that stigma. I think I've missed out on a lot of jobs because the wives for some reason - feel threatened. - Jealous of you? But I don't nanny with makeup on. I show up in, like, sweatpants and a T-shirt. Like, I'm very, you know, just, you know-- but the husbands won't look me in the eye, like, ever. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do you think that they masturbate - when they think about you? - Okay. Wow. No, like, you know, they go in the toilet because you're there with the kids. I'd rather not think about that. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Mwah. Mwah. - Please, welcome on board. - Okay. Thank you. This is nice. - Is this your boat? - No. This is not. I actually don't know who owns the boat, but I saw it. Like, I come in from the street, and I said, "I think that would be a nice place to actually go on a date." - So this isn't your boat? - It's not my boat. Don't you think that's kind of weird to use someone else's boat? No, this is--the gate was open, so I figure, you know, if it's the gate open, it's open to everybody, and it's nice. This is a beautiful lake, and... - It's very muddy. - Okay. Don't worry, I'm not one of those people that are gonna literally take you, like, in the middle of the lake right there where that boat is and then murder you and put you underneath 'cause nobody will ever find you anyway. Just saying, in general. I'm not one of those people. There are people like that. - Okay, um... - Yeah. Well, let's start over. I'm Jamie. - Domenico, again. - Nice to meet you. I have my cell phone on me, so if you try and, you know, take me away on the boat, I'll call someone. No, I would never do that. I mean, for just getting to know you a little bit more, obviously, and I decided, you know, let's have, like, some aperitif and eat something. So I brought a bottle of wine... some napkins. I got--hopefully you like it. It's soppressata and Asiago cheese. This is Italian. It's really good for aperitif. And then I got the wine. Why would you bring this? It's aperitif time in Italy. Aperitif? You have a little cheese, a little meat, and then a little wine. I told you that I was a vegan, though. It says it on my profile. Vegan, it means you like vegetables too. I didn't bring any vegetables today. No. Vegan means that I don't like meat. This right here is murder. Isn't a vegan, like, vegetarian? - Like, you like vegetables? - No. This means I don't eat meat. That's not right. That's just wrong. I have another one. This, I'll keep it close so I can eat. You brought two of them? I had two because I didn't know how much we were gonna eat. That is ridiculous that you would do that. So let's do this, then. What about cheese? Cheese is no meat. No! Vegans don't eat cheese either. Maybe this is a language barrier. Vegan means that you don't eat meat and don't eat cheese or-- nothing that comes from animals, 'cause it's not right. - Not even the milk? - No. They need to release the milk. - It's not something that you-- - No. These animals, they have milk that-- Otherwise they blow up because they have too much milk. No, it doesn't work that way. They're forced to, like, make milk in the factory. It doesn't work that way. The problem is unfortunately-- Just let me ask you a question. How long has it been since you've been with someone? Like, actually dated someone? - Three years or more. - Okay. I think the problem is, is that you don't listen to what the other person is saying. Like, you should know not to bring that. I grew up in, like, in the south of Italy, where people just go with meat and actually, we kill the pigs, and then we roast while they're still bleeding. That's--that's, like, an Italian tradition over the 15th of August, which is Saint Mary's Day. On Saint Mary's Day, you get the beer, you put it in the river, like, so--they keep it cold, and then literally you grow a pig for three months, you feed him until he blows, and then you release it in the forest. With your friends, you go and catch it, and then you stab it under the throat, and so it walks a little bit, and then it's very sad in a way, but it's good. Stop. I don't want to hear about that. - That's awful. - Okay, okay. So I'll open the wine in one second. I was noticing that I didn't bring any--I forgot glasses 'cause when I went in the grocery-- Just put that away. Put it away. - I'll just keep it on the side. - Yeah. That's disgusting. Just keep it right here so you don't see it. - You like cupcakes? - I'm good. - I'll have some of the wine. - No glasses. It's okay?

When you say now you're ready for love, to love someone is to will the good of that other person. When you continually view people as objects, as women as nothing more than just some naiveté receptacle for whatever your passions might be, then you'll get nowhere, and you'll continually get nowhere. You invited me here to speak frankly. I can't speak more frankly than I have. - I can see. - You can see? - Yeah. - You can only see, but you can't listen. - No, I am listening-- - And when you start listening, things will change. That doesn't mean that I'm-- I got to tell you something. At a given point, it's not about you. The narcissism of which you define yourself. The fact that you said, "I'm Italian." Who cares that you're Italian? - Women do. - Women do? No, only the women in your narrow, just over-Hollywood-ized perception of life. They care about quality of character. You're asking a priest, you're asking a rabbi to comment initially on online dating. We're both in favor of it. Who wouldn't be in favor of it? That's just a portal. It's an entry point into establishing potential relationships. But sustainable relationships go much deeper than that, and the very issues to which I'm challenging you, I could be as effective of speaking to the wall. You're not listening.

Somebody messaged you from OkCupid. - I didn't send a message from-- - Well, they did. So go. And take a shower. - Hi. - Hi. Domenico. Nice meeting you. Claire. Mwah. Mwah. - Where are you originally from? - Massachusetts. Isn't Massachusetts, like, the little state behind Boston? Yes. The little state behind Boston. That's exactly what it is. - Is that what it is? - Mm-hmm. I live, like--well, I grew up 20 minutes south of Boston. So I have relatives in Solbiate Arno. - Full-on Italian? - No. Little bit-- Yeah. And then so we visited them-- By the way. Aww, grazie. - Si? - No, no. - Very nice. - I know. So you're open. This is amazing. It's fun, actually. Yeah. I'm enjoying this date a lot. Now, I came here, you know, and for eight years, I realize how it's not very easy to be in a relationship in this town. No. It's an impossible town to be in a relationship in. You went through the same problem, then? Yes, yes. - You like to cook? - I do like to cook. - Do you like to cook? - Oh, me? Always. I'm always cooking Italian. I'm always-- What's your specialty? What's your dish? Oh, pasta. All kinds. Amatriciana, carbonara, Bolognese. So when am I coming over for dinner? - Oh, like that? - Why not? Whenever you want to come over. I'm open. Okay. I'll bring dessert. I can bake. You like to have, like, a man that is sweet? Doesn't matter if I'm from Italy... - Yes. - And we are very different? No, no. As long as you speak Italian in bed. - That's probably fine. - Ooh. Yeah, this is--this is-- this is all I was looking for. Like, somebody that speaks my language... - Mm-hmm. - Loves my country... - Mm-hmm. - Is there any trick that I need to know? Like, are you pregnant? Do you have kids? Like, what's the-- No, no. There's nothing really wrong with me. - No? - And, yeah. And I'm still out there in the single world. I don't know why. They say usually that, you know, when you meet somebody, you know right away, like, in the first 30 seconds if you want to see them again. - Mm-hmm. - Now, based on you seeing me for 30 seconds, what are you thinking? You want to see me more? Like, do you think that I'm interesting for you or no? - No, you are interesting. - What do you like? I--no, you're fun, and you're very, um, straightforward. - Oh, I see. - Mm-hmm. And honest. - I was just-- - Look at that. You're blushing, by the way. - Um... - You're really--you're red, like your drink right now. - I know. This was good. - You're blushing. You're very red on your face. Well, all right. Well, maybe it'll go away. - You're blushy. - Stop, stop. So let's say me and you go out. How many dates I have to wait until I can actually have an intercourse with you? Um, well, standard is, like, three. - Three dates? - Yeah. If you-- - This counts as one, right? - Yeah. This is one. So we do one more and then that's it? Yeah. If--you know, if you get that third date. - I see. - You have to impress me, though. That's the thing. You have to take me to some-- you have to have some kind of plan, right? And take me to someplace fun that you know I'll like, which you can actually just ask me, and I'll tell you all the places that I will like. - Like, what do you like? - Like, I would love to go ice-skating. That would be awesome. - Do you go ice skating? - I do. I like it. - Yeah. See? That's a great date. - Last time, I break my leg. - You broke your leg? - I did. Broke my leg. Well, if you go, then don't break your leg, and then you have a better chance of having sex with me. Six Flags. Like, I would love going to-- - Do you like Six Flags? - Oh, yeah. - Hell yeah. - So if I come and I puke, - is that still okay? - Roller coasters. 'Cause those things makes me feel sick a little bit. - Oh. - But if I do it because I love you and I just want to please you... Right. Then as long as you don't puke on me, I think it would be fine. - Okay. - Yeah. What else do I like? I like to go-- What about, like, a nice walk in Malibu or something? - On the beach? - That's nice. You know, if it's a nice day out. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, if it's rainy and chilly... although even if it's rainy and chilly, that could be cool. And we could make out underneath the Santa Monica Pier where those, like, pylons are. - Ooh. I know that-- - Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's romantic. All right, so if there's a second date, what will it be? At my place. I will cook for you. - Oh, right. - That's the second date. We already established that that's the second date. Yeah, and the third, we're gonna have sex. But that's not the date. You have to, like, take me out. Oh, first I take you out and then we will have sex? - Yes. - So third date-- A date is not, like, sex. That's--you know, that's the end. That's the cherry on top. - It's very involved. - Oh, yeah, no. This is the American way. So you're really gonna want to see me again? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. I think it would be fun. No? - I would love that. - Okay, good. - I would really love that. - Yay. Look at that. Now you're blushing. All right. Here, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm flirting with you, totally. Well, it was really nice meeting you. Well, thank you. - It was really nice. - It was nice meeting you too. ♪ - You're amazing. - Aww, thanks. ♪ See, you get a kiss at the end of the first date.

I was the Italian guy who came to your office. Oh. Oh, yeah. The Italian guy. - Domenico. - You were kind of an asshole. No, I was very much an asshole. Um, I just wanted to tell you that I'm very sorry. You were very helpful to me when I started this online thing, and I may acted like an idiot. Okay. It went horrible, by the way. This online dating stuff. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe I'm not supposed to meet anybody this way. - I don't know. - You know, I--I'm so sorry. I lost my keys, and I have no idea where they are, and I kind of need to be somewhere, so... Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. That's all I wanted to say. - All right. - Bye. Bye. - Do you need a ride? - What? My car is right here. I could drive you wherever you need to go. Oh, no. That's okay. I'm not a rapist or anything, I promise you. No. I know. It's--I'm sure you've got better things to do. Not really. All I've been doing is dating on the computer, and it's all done now. So my Fiat 500 is right here if you need any help. - I'm--I'm-- - That's okay. Bye. - Fix it again, Tony. - What? Uh, it--I--that's what they say about Fiats. They say it stands for "Fix it again, Tony." - I never heard this before. - No? - You are funny. - No. I--it's an old joke. I'm so--it's not. Um, so would you mind? I really don't mind. I could drive you wherever you have to go until you find your keys. Which is probably never, 'cause your purse is the size of my grandma's house in the south of Italy. Okay. Thank you. So I'm going to Olympic and Sawtelle.
