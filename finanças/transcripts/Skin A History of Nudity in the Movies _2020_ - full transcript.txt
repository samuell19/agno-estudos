...the first film I ever saw with nudity in it. Yes, and I loved it! 'Shampoo'. - [George] Sorry. - 'Caligula'. 'Caligula'... how old was I when 'Caligula' came out? Was I 12, 11? - So I never saw nudity in a film, until I was in it. They wouldn't even let me go in to see my own film. Which was hilarious because I said, "I hate to say, but I was the one who made it rated R." - "Wow, everybody's naked! And they're touching each other, oh my God." - 'Blue Lagoon'. Brooke Shields. - I mean I'm sure I did see 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' when I was younger. - Well Hedy Lamarr, I think, did a Swedish picture called, 'Ekstase'— 'Ecstasy'. - 'Bid Bad Mama'. So when we found out that Angie Dickinson was doing a nude scene—oh yes, we went to the drive in! - The one with Marlon Brando with the— the French movie, the— Bertolucci movie, the... the butter! (laughing) Yeah, 'Last Tango in Paris'! - My own movie, with my sister, Margo. I don't think she was fully nude, but she'd been raped, and I saw her breasts, and I was mortified. - Pornos maybe I saw when I was young. (grunting) - I'd never seen a movie where an actress just took her top off and there was nothing underneath. Whoa, wow, anything is possible. (calm music) - Right now, we're in a very interesting time where people are very aware of power dynamics, and especially when they pertain to sexuality. And this is all the result of the Me Too movement that hit Hollywood in 2017. - First though, we begin with the growing Me Too movement. Hundreds marching down Hollywood Boulevard. - Evidence of new rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein. - Actor Richard Dreyfuss is the latest big name to be accused. - [Reporter] A new allegation of sexual assault. - [Reporter] Claiming actor, Steven Seagal, sexually assaulted— - Three women have now accused Dustin Hoffman. - Five women have come forward accusing— (all talking at once) - Now with the #MeToo Movement, think it's really important for women to know that nudity in film is a choice. And it's never an expectation. - For 'Striptease', when we all had our final audition. We had to all perform a dance that we choreographed ourself, chose our own music. And during that dance we had to take off our top. We didn't even have the role yet, and we're already doing nudity. Which was awkward but I did it. - You never audition with nudity. You never, I never had to take my clothes to get a part. - There is no just reason for 30, 40, 50 people milling around when a nude scene is happening. I think lawyers that represent actresses are getting very aggressive in how they are writing the nudity riders. - There's an actual contract, part of the contract, called a nudity rider where they get very specific about what you will and what you won't do. So when you get on set you're protected. Because there are times where you get on a set, and you agreed to do a certain amount of nudity, and the director will try to push those limits. - We went to the set of the HBO series 'The Deuce', where they have a new job called Intimacy Coordinator. - And if you are asking your actors too simply roll around naked with each other, or even just with a piece of cloth between them, and get off on each other, you're asking your actors to do sex work. And, besides being in violation of our union standards, is also not what these actors are hired to do, I would hope. - As an actress, I have to say that once I did nudity, I went from being a girl to a woman. As an actress, I became an actress to an artist. - There's something about being free from the hindrance of clothing. There is a real essence of strength of character and mind. Because it's just raw me. And I'm not trying to be anything other than what is my physicality and what is my mind behind that. - I didn't know if they were saying I was a good actress, or if I was, they just liked to see me naked. I think that the whole idea of feeling, when you're a young actress, that here it goes, it's inevitable, I'm gonna have to do nudity or I'm not gonna get anywhere is part of a much bigger story. - Nudity is never gonna go away. It's something we're always fascinated by. I think it's educational. - The purpose of art is to take what we have now, and argue with eternity that it belongs in the eternal dialogue. That's what advances us as a culture, us as a society. I think that there's that impulse to hold on to anything that is fleeting. And the nude is just, it's seen as perfection. It's seen as eternal. The human body between then and now is— the only difference is: what is sexually attractive, what isn't sexually attractive— and those things change, too. The day after Michelangelo died, the Rope hired an artist to come in and start painting. Because in that time span, nudity had gone from something that was acceptable, and especially comprehensible. All of a sudden nudity was totally unacceptable. So we see the pendulum of conservative and liberal just. And of course in cinema it's the same thing. When you're at a museum, or you're at home looking at a painting, you're looking at that illusionistic window. It's almost the same proportions as a cinema frame. Cinema is painting; it's got the movement, the precise reproduction and the narrative of great Renaissance paintings. (calm music) - Probably 20 minutes after they invented film, somebody thought, "Wouldn't it be neat if we started photographing naked people?" And so I think there's been nudity since the very early days, in fact, you might even say there's been nudity in films from before there were films. (calm music) Eadweard Muybridge, a famous photographer, began experimenting photographing animals and humans in motion. And the human beings were almost always naked. - He was pioneering film maker. And they were also pioneering nudes. - [Jonathan] And then once movies kind of go out to the public as an entertainment form, by the 1890s, I'm sure there were probably clandestine nudies and photographs of naked people. At the turn to the 20th century movies were very very short, maybe lasting a minute in length. They were mostly just, you might say, sensations or attractions. Georges Melies, in 1897 made a film, 'After the Ball', which featured a woman who later became his wife. - It's very quick, you don't see a whole lot. I think mostly you see her rear. But it was still risqué for the time, something that people had not seen. So it caused quite a stir. - Well around 1913, 1914 a group of Eastern filmmakers like Carl Laemmle, D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. Demille, decided that the weather in New England, and the unions in New England weren't worth dealing with much longer. And they decided to come out to California, which is the perfect place for motion picture making. It's like God created a state that'd be perfect for this new industry art, where you've basically got great clear weather, sunny weather. And the key here is probably 1915, when D.W. Griffith produces and directs 'The Birth of a Nation', which I think you can probably consider the landmark flagship motion picture that begins what we think of as the narrative feature film that will be an evening's entertainment. - The thing that really invented nudity in films in America, ironically, was the greatest inventor in American history. And that would be Thomas Alva Edison. Edison claimed to have invented the motion picture camera, and the motion picture projector. He didn't, the Lumiere brothers of France did. But he was strong enough in the United States to say that he did it, and got patents on the motion picture projector and camera. So he then said that anyone who wanted to show a motion picture had to pay a license fee. And he formed something called The Trust, which was a monopoly that said if you want to do a picture in the United States, you have to pay Thomas Edison and The Trust in order to show a picture. People didn't want to pay that. So a very small segment, called The Independents, decided we're gonna make our own movies. The problem they had was they weren't powerful, like the monopoly of The Trust, so they had to come up with a gimmick that would be able to allow them to compete. And they said, "Maybe we could show skin." And they knew that it had to have some kind of redeeming social importance, it couldn't be considering prurient or scandalous. So they decided to make it based on an artists model. It was filmed in New York, and the top artist model was a woman named Audrey Munson. And Audrey Munson is the inspiration for at least 15 statues and sculptures that are in New York City alone. So they decided to come up with a movie, since she was the inspiration of all these sculptors, and they called it 'Inspiration'. And that was in 1915. And as long as you were motionless, and like a tableau, and like a statue, that wasn't considered to be erotic, or sexual. It was considered to be artistic and classical. It was a huge huge success, no surprise. And she followed up a year later with 'Purity'. Again these all had to have some kind of redeeming social importance. She played a dual role, Purity and Virtue. And she became the most famous actress in America. And it was a counterpoint to the main guys that were the big guys, the Edison and The Trust. They were putting on people like Mary Pickford, and Lillian Gish, and trying to appeal to a huge audience. And so they were the "girl next door". So the contrast, with The Independents putting out someone who is a nude artist model was certainly, uh— piqued the public's attention. This story became very tragic, though, after that. Because she drank mercury in a suicide attempt. And they said that she was very close to death. She somehow survived for the next 74 years, dying at age 104 in 1996. But she was in a sanitarium most of that time. So it was a very sad end. And people saw that as somebody poses nude, and it's the road to ruin and degradation. - 'A Daughter of the Gods', starring Annette Kellermann for Fox in 1916 has nude swimming scenes. Annette Kellermann was a swimming star from Australia. And she was already a star really before she made movies. - She held all the world records for swimming. And she also had gotten arrested in Boston in 1907 because she a wore a one piece bathing suit, which was considered scandalous. - [Jonathan] And the movies that she made in Hollywood were clearly designed to exploit her swimming abilities. And in deed, she appears naked, although she has long hair that artfully covers certain parts of herself. - She undress but she has tresses, and they come down and they cover her breasts. But, because she's moving, as opposed to what the artist model did, it shifts from side to side. And there are the first glimpses of actually bare female flesh in an American film. And, in fact, there was a movie made of it called 'Million Dollar Mermaid'. And it starred Esther Williams in 1952. So once the barrier of showing nudity in film had been crossed then it started to seep more into the mainstream movies. And there was a movie in 1916 called 'Intolerance', by the very famous director, D.W. Griffith. - And one of the historical settings is Babylon. It shows the debauchery that was going on at the time, which is I think 500 BC, and how crazy things got. And part of the debauchery is the extras in the background baring their breasts, and orgies, and kind of like a pre-'Caligula' 'Caligula' in many ways. - So it enabled them to make the argument that this had redeeming social importance, and that it was based on history. It was not a problem, the audiences ate them up. (ragtime music) - From about 1915 to 1927, the glorious age of silent cinema, you have the motion picture studios creating the modern assembly line of production. And at the time movies were considered a kind of disreputable medium. - There was some big sex scandals that happened. In the early '20s, the William Desmond Taylor scandal where he was murdered. And then there was the Fatty Arbuckle problem. - Headline making scandals involving drugs, death, suicide, rape. Hollywood was configured as the kind of Sodom on the Pacific. - People don't realize that movies were really risqué back in the '20s. - It was coming off of something of a social revolution with regard to women in the 1920s that was beginning to get reflected in sexual mores. And those were getting reflected in the movies. And people who were against where the future was heading, didn't like it, wanted to head it off, and so they thought that it would be necessary to have a code. - Hollywood had a huge public relations problem as a result of this. And of course, Hollywood wants to appeal to everybody. They make films for the mass audience. They don't want a black eye. - In 1927, 'Wings' came out. And it became the first Academy Award winning picture. But it was scandalous in its own way. There were two men kissing in the film. And also Clara Bow, who was considered a very big star a the time, she exposed her breasts. And for an acclaimed movie in a big production, for that to happen it was quite risqué at the time. - And so increasingly, in the late 1920s various groups of what at the time were called moral guardians, decide that Hollywood really has a bad influence. And this will only accelerate in 1927 with the onset of sound. ♪ Don't cry Tootsie don't cry ♪ ♪ Goodbye Tootsie goodbye ♪ - Almost overnight the whole industry became sound oriented. Silent movies were done within a year. It was during the depression, people wanted to be cheered up. So they had sound movies to go to, they had musicals. They had movies that spoke to them. A lot of the movies reflected what was going on in society then. - Then you had sexual innuendo. That's when you had Mae West. - I shall die to make you happy. - Ooh, but you wouldn't be much use to me dead. - I see a man in your life. - What, only one? - All of her films are getting condemned ratings from the new Legion of Decency. - They set up a thing called The Catholic Legion of Decency, which rates movies A, B, or C. And A is just totally fine. B is we have some qualms about this but, if you have to see it, see it. C is if you see it, you're actually going to go to hell. (buzzer buzzing) They would give Catholics the list in church, and tell them what movies to see. But it turns out that Catholics would take that list, and go to the movies. They would take the list, they'd say oh, this must be good. - I love the period right before the production code kicks in. When you're watching people like Busby Berkeley just push the limit as far as cinema was going to go right then. All the girls are meant to look naked. And he knows exactly what he's doing, and that he's probably not gonna get away with this in a year. - And there were was censorship boards popping up all over the country. Those censorship boards were a huge nuisance, because they would have to cut their movies for each state. New York State was one of the worst. And so a lot of the versions of movies that would go out, would be a lot more racy outside of NewYork State. - Movies had no first amendment rights during this period. In 1915 the Supreme Court ruled that movies are a business, pure and simple. And just like meat, going across interstate lines, movies could be regulated by the states, and by cities. No first amendment rights at all until 1952. So if the state can regulate your industry, why not go for a self regulation scheme that keeps the state, the city, and especially the feds off your back? - They decided to try to bring in somebody who would go to the various states, and say "Look you don't need censorship boards. We'll censor ourselves, according to a code of conduct." - And to allay those fears, the moguls decide to appoint a front man to head The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, which was a cartel of the Hollywood producers. Where, like a lot of businessmen, they come together in order to regulate their own art, and to keep out competition. - [Jonathan] And he hired Will Hays, who was the Postmaster General of the United States. - Who better to determine how Hollywood polices themselves than the former Postmaster General of the United States? - The Hays code was created because middle America, much as it is now, was up in arms about the scandals going on in Hollywood. - I mean the Catholics had been at the work of artistic censorship for nearly 2000 years. So they really know how to do it. - And so in 1930 Will Hays gets together with several key Catholic individuals in Los Angeles, and he formalizes his don'ts and be carefuls. He writes them out into a much more elaborate and specific production code. - I had to do a lot of research into the production code administration cuts to film. Which that was fascinating too, just the minute detail. The mere suggestion flesh or indecency. - Well, what the code says about nudity is that nudity is prohibited, period, full stop. And that nudity in fact, or in silhouette, is prohibited. And that other characters in the film looking at offscreen nudity cannot even pretend it's there, and gaze upon it licentiously. - The nice thing about Will Hays is that Will Hays couldn't care less about morality, couldn't care less. He was making 100,000 dollars from the studios. And was basically like Jack Valenti later on. He worked for the studios, and he cared about the studios, and that's where his loyalty was. - We look back at Will Hays now and can have many, many laughs about it because everything was so, "Thou shall not do this, you should not have that. No nudity, no this, no that," and nothing licentious or lecherous, and used words that were very "value judgment" triggers. - The term pre-code does not really refer to before the code, but before the enforcement of the code. Because the code existed throughout the pre-code era, but it just wasn't enforced, fortunately. The studios thought that the code, in 1930, was a public relations ploy and they had absolutely no intention of enforcing it. - There were many companies, of course, in the red, facing bankruptcy, who were desperate. And in particular, Paramount and Warner Brothers. They felt they couldn't be limited by the production code. They needed their sex to sell their movies during these desperate times. - So you have these pre-code films that really got away with a lot. - [Mick] The movie that really got them to enforce the code was 'The Sign of the Cross', from 1932. - 'Sign of the The Cross' is filled with sex, filled with nudity, filled with homosexuality, filled with bestiality, everything you can think of that's not terribly Christian that's in the Bible. - [Mick] 'Sign of the Cross', displays Claudette Colbert in a way that the production code of 1934 certainly would not have allowed. - You see her breasts bobbing up in the water, but no one said a word, pre-code. And DeMille had a foot fetish. And he had some kind of really unhealthy connection between nude women and gorillas. And in 'The Sign of the Cross', we have a sequence where a Christian woman is tied to a post. And this very horny looking gorilla is walking towards her as if there's gonna be a sexual, this is 1932. Because DeMille for all his puritanical preaching, he showed you every vice under the sun. - It's very interesting, because it looks like, had the code not come in, there would have been nudity. Because it was, nudity was coming, it was really clear. 'Murder at the Vanities', you see the women are nude but they're covering their nipples. ♪ And then you put me to sleep ♪ ♪ Sweet marijuana marijuana ♪ - That was followed one year later, in 1933, by 'Ecstasy', which is one of the most notorious movies ever made. It was actually shot in Hungary. - My father told me about Hedy Lamarr, and that he was so struck by her. Because that was really for him the first, I think probably the first time he'd seen a nude woman. So he would have been very young when he saw 'Ecstasy'. And he probably saw an early cut of it, because of his father. - [Jonathan] And the scene takes place. She's out in a lake swimming, and she's draped her clothes over her horse, and the horse runs away. So she has to run after the horse in order to retrieve her clothes. So she runs through the woods, and she is full frontal nude. - [Mick] The scene is something that is just so eye popping, in the context of Hollywood film in the 1930s. It's truly amazing. Now the film, of course, didn't get a production code seal. - And then he said, a few years later, when she came to Hollywood she came for dinner at the house. And he told me he couldn't take his eyes off of her breasts. - [Jonathan] 'Ecstasy', would have been censored by city agencies, by state agencies. It would probably show for a couple of nights at your local theater before the local cops came in and shut it down. And it might have been shown in a censored version, despite how it would have been advertised. Because there's nothing like it in Hollywood cinema in the '30s and '40s. - That is maybe the first sex scene based on female pleasure, full stop. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. - Throughout the pre-code era, you'd occasionally get glimpses of nudity in film. And maybe the most notorious example, 'Tarzan and His Mate'. - And this was a ploy used by a lot of the producers. Because if you set it in a native country, or native setting— - Wait, Tarzan. (screaming) (dress tearing) - [Barry] People didn't wear clothes in the jungle. There's a scene where Tarzan and Jane swim underwater in the nude. And a lot of of people that was, or were supposed to think that was Maureen O'Sullivan, but it was not, it was a body double. And that's the first instance of a body double being used for a nude scene. - In the context of Hollywood cinema this was abhorrent. And it have of a sort of picture of what Hollywood cinema might have been like had not the production code come in and busted up the party in 1934. - And then in the very last pre-code movie, which was actually released after the code, but it was approved, somehow, before the code. And then it wasn't, it didn't go through the process. It was 'Scarlet Empress'. And 'The Scarlet Empress' actually begins with a torture scene of women getting burned as witches and they're all naked. (calm music) - Then the production code came in in 1934. And that was Joseph Breen, who was a censor, a religious man, a moral police. And basically just decreed that no film could be made in America unless it passed muster with him. - He's the guy who quite literally put his imprint on every classical Hollywood film. - It may interest you to sit in with us at a meeting of the production code administration in Hollywood, where we are working for finer and better motion pictures. Form the very beginning of the picture we work with producers, authors, and all who are connected with the production to the end, that the finished product may be free from reasonable objection. - There's a strong case to be made that the Hays code, or rather the Breen code, that's really what it was, changed not only the morality of movies, but changed the morality of the country because of the influence that movies had. Breen was the guy who actually regulated Hollywood cinema from 1934 to 1954, basically what we think of as the classical studio system era. But they give Breen the power to actually forbid financing of a motion picture. Without Breen's green light, a Hollywood studio, could not get financing from the banks in NewYork to make the film. - If the code movies that were made in the '30s and '40s teach us anything, is that there are ways around stuff to suggest the most vile things without actually having to show them. - One of the first films that defied the moral order of the production code, and the production code authority is Howard Hughes' 'The Outlaw'. - What do you know about that? - Which is basically a five yearlong dispute that Howard Hughes has with the Breen office beginning in '41 into '43, and then it gets sort of released in '46, in which it's advertising campaign is perhaps the most, in the Breen office eyes, most offensive thing about it, in which there'd be billboards enticing audiences with the tag line, "What are the two great reasons to see Jane Russell in 'The Outlaw'?" They actually hired a blimp to go over San Francisco advertising the film as well, and the blimp imagery, and Jane Russell imagery is kind of obvious. - For a long time nudity was considered a career breaker. And in 1952, Marilyn Monroe was just starting to make it as a starlet. And a gossip columnist found out that there had been a calendar that Marilyn had posed for in 1949. So they called a press conference. And they asked her, and they said "What did you have on in the calendar photo?" And she said "The radio." So it went from being a negative to a positive. And I think that's what changed the whole ethos of nudity in film. - In the 1950s there's a growing market for what were calling nudies. And these are basically cheap 16, 35 millimeter films sometimes, of films, not production code films, they would never get a production code seal. - In the mid to late 50's you had these things called nudist films. - In 1954 the New York State Board of Appeals ruled in the case of a motion picture called 'Garden of Eden', that nudity per se was not obscene. And this, of course, opens the floodgates for filmmakers to portray on screen nudity, in a way they couldn't before. - The production code was starting to fall apart. You had people like Otto Preminger making movies that were being show without the seal of approval. So the mores of the world was changing. - In nudie movies, originally, it was like girls playing volleyball. And so they would chat, and they would swim. They were nudist camp movies, basically. Nothing ever happened in them, they weren't very interesting. In 'A Shot in the Dark', there's a very funny scene in a nudist colony with Peter Sellers, which is a pretty accurate representation of what nudist colonies were like at the time. - And so if it was couched in the terms of health, fitness, exercise. - There used to be theaters that were called art theaters. And they were in all towns, all over the place, mostly in cities. - So the nudie cuties, they wanted to stay under the radar. Because that's how they made their money. - These films would also to play to men at like a bachelor party. Somebody had set up a 16 millimeter projector, and show what were called either blue movies, in the '20s or '30s, or later stag films or nudies in the '50s and '60s. - Well, there was a subset of nudie pictures, away from the nudist camp movies, which were basically boring, in which they would add a note of menace by having somebody scary show up and chase the girls around. - These type of movies, with the damsel in distress, and damsel in undress were referred to as monster nudies. - [Joe] There was a movie called 'The Monster of Camp Sunshine', where it was supposed to be a gorilla, but it was played by a chimpanzee. And then Ed Wood, in his waning years, was unfortunately reduced to doing some of these pictures. 'Orgy of the Dead' was one. - It's an excuse for a bunch of exotic dancers to come out one by one and do a really lame, completely not sexy, dance. - And then there's— - Kiss me quick. - Kiss me, quick. - Kiss me quick. - 'Kiss me Quick', which was a sort of a Russ Meyer type movie that had the guys in monster masks playing Frankenstein, and Dracula, or their non-Universal copyrightable versions. And they would chase the girls around. There's no erotic content whatsoever in these movies. They're limp noodle movies. They're just there to have girls running around, and get as much action in the frame as possible. - And then there was some movies called nudie cuties. If you made it more of a comedy, you could somehow insert some female nudity in it, and get away with it. They didn't want to have things that might inflame the public, and make young men's minds turn to dangerous things. Doris Wishman was one of the rare female directors who would be doing movies that had a lot of what we could T and A in them. And she did a series of movies with a very famous stripper named Chesty Morgan, who had 73-inch natural breasts. And so she made a movie with Chesty Morgan called 'Agent 73'. And then she did another movie with Chesty Morgan called 'Deadly Weapons'. They were Chesty Morgan's natural endowments. - Doris Wishman did a couple of monster nudies. But Herschell Gordon Lewis had a different take. When he did 'Blood Feast', it was a gore film. It had nudity, and it had a Playboy Playmate in it. But the appeal of this movie was that you were seeing gore in a way that you had never seen before. Pull out the girls tongue, and cut it off. These were the progenitors of today's gore movies. They were incredibly crude. And they were one of the reasons for the creation of the rating system because they played drive ins. And people would be driving down the street, and look up at the screen with their kids in the car. And there was this woman being disemboweled. So they were sort of like, "Maybe we ought to do something about this." - Before 'The Godfather' was even a thought in his head, Francis Ford Coppola started making a couple nudie cuties. One is the called 'The Bellboy and the Playgirls'. - Russ Meyer had actually gotten his start making these underground movies, and one of them that was one of the first American movies that could be shown with nudity was called 'The Immoral Mr. Teas'. - Russ came along right at the right time. Because you had these nudist films, but they were really a dead end. And he came up with the preposterous idea that Teas would be able to see through women's clothes. - And he goes to the dentist, and he gets a shot of Novocaine. And next thing he knows, they're naked. - We did it in four days, cost $24,000. - [Interviewer] Four days. And it opened up the floodgates of permissiveness as we know it in these United States today. It was a quote from Time Magazine. I was glad to do it. - It was like a money machine. And now you had all these people getting in on the act, making what were called nudie cuties. But Russ came first, and Russ scored the biggest. - But it was so outrageous for that time, to see that much nudity, and to deal with a man who was a voyeur, who was letching at women. Heretofore they didn't have anything of that nature. - Yes the code was still in affect, but it didn't bother him because he was distributing his movies in a way that it didn't require the system. 'The Immoral Mr. Teas' was like his peeing on Will Hays' grave. - 'Peeping Tom' was a British art film. Very disturbing film, even today, which has nudity in the context of a kind of voyeuristic murderer who uses the camera kind of as his surrogate murder weapon. It opened the the way for foreign films with nudity to be distributed in the American market. The landmark film here is the Brigitte Bardot vehicle 'And God Created Woman'. And it's a huge hit. - The line was CinemaScope was for photographing snakes and funerals, but Vadim uses her stretched out across the screen sunbathing. It's as much a sort of triumph of the medium as this triumph of this very sexual moment. - When I waited in line to see Brigitte Bardot in 'God Created Woman', I go (gasping) oh wow. Oh wow, I love it. - Once they saw the box office returns for something like that, they realize nudity is something that Hollywood can traffic in for profit. - And I think that's what made the beginning of the Indies. And that's when the studio system went belly up. They couldn't compete with that. (calm music) - The landmark film to me that shows the production code is walking wounded, is Alfred Hitchcock's film 'Psycho', which has everything the Breen office would not have approved. It has sex, it has violence, it has the relationship between sex and violence. - And that led to one of the most famous and harrowing scenes in motion picture history. Everyone, I think remembers that Janet Leigh gets stabbed in the shower by Anthony Perkins. She would not do a nude scene, she had a no nudity clause. So they had to get a body double. And so they hired Marli Renfro, who was an actress and a nude model. And because it was not Janet Leigh, Hitchcock had to shoot it in such a way that you couldn't tell who was actually in the shower. Then you have the swinging '60s, as they were called. You had the new handsome president, John F Kennedy after Dwight D. Eisenhower in a rather conservative period. And things opened up quite a bit. Marilyn Monroe was the first actress to prove that nudity does not destroy a career, it can even help a career. Marilyn Monroe was hired to do a film called 'Something's Gotta Give'. And it was kind of her comebackfilm. So she said "I need to make a splash," literally in a swimming pool. And then she went in her dressing room and came out with a blue bathrobe, and nothing underneath. And she said "Nobody looks as good in the nude as I do." The only nudity that survived was a very quick glimpse. She comes to the edge of the pool, and she sits it on the edge of the pool. And the way she seated you cannot even see her rear end. And as she gets up, you can see one breast from the side and her entire rear end. Marilyn had been tardy so much, that they were not that far into the film. And on June eighth, one week after her 36th birthday, she was fired, permanently. She was the biggest star in the world. And if she would do a nude scene, who wouldn't do a nude scene? Probably the foremost Marilyn Monroe imitator, at the time, was Jayne Mansfield. So she made a movie in 1963. It was called 'Promises Promises'. - You gotta remember, there was Marilyn Monroe. And then Jayne Mansfield was right behind her as far as popularity. - [Joe] She takes a bubble bath. The bubbles dissipated very quickly, and all of Jayne was on display. - She liked to tease. - [Tommy] Sandy? - Do you want something, honey? - No it's all right. - And she knew this, and this is her stock and trade. - [Joe] Now, the floodgates had been opened. - [Jim] She was the first celebrity, post Hays commission, to do a nude scene here in the United States. - Marilyn Monroe had done it, and Jayne Mansfield had done it. Then Mamie Van Doren did a movie called 'Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt'. ♪ I used to be a stripper down on Main ♪ ♪ Now I'm the main attraction on the strip ♪ - I tried to break the doors down. Jayne Mansfield was either one. And Marilyn was actually the first one. Hef asked me to do Playboy magazine many times, and I turned him down. And I did it this time because I had a movie connection with him. It was 'Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt'. I did that movie strictly for money. There's a beer bath. So I figured, why not take a beer bath? It's really makes me feel alive. Beer bath, I don't want to do a beer bath. Come on he said "Yeah, it'll make more money at the theaters." And since I own the movie—some of it— I said, "Okay I'll do it." That movie made a lot of money. A lot of money. And so did the layout in the Playboy magazine. That was the beginning of me opening the door for nudity. - Of course there are films where nudity is important to the story. 'The Pawnbroker' has nothing to do with sex, but it does use nudity in a very important way. The film itself is about a guy who suffered trauma during World War II. And part of the trauma was seeing these naked people being murdered. And so the idea that they felt you had to cut that out because of it's prurient interest, was pretty ludicrous to most people. 'The Pawnbroker' was one of the last films, actually, that had a major production code battle. It made the production code look really old fashioned at that point. The production code is gonna be abandoned within a couple years. - We started looking to the Europeans, which had been, of course, using nudity long before we were. (upbeat music) Antonioni's 'Blow-Up' now has two things to recommend it. One, it's his most accessible movie. - Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes? - A couple of minutes? I haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out. - And two, it's the first film to show pubic hair in modern cinema. - [Barry] David Hemmings plays a photographer who takes a picture, and he winds up seeing two illicit lovers, one played by Vanessa Redgrave. - Give me those pictures. You can't photograph people like that. - Who is topless in the film. Then he meets two young, what they used to call groupies, and he takes them home with him. There is a flash of Jane Birkin's pubic hair. Which is the first time that's ever been shown on an American movie screen. And it stayed in, because it was quick. - 'I Am Curious, YelloW' was a foreign film, it was Swedish. And it had very explicit nudity. And there were movies with explicit nudity at the time. But this was playing at your neighborhood movie theater. So it became a really big deal. In fact I remember seeing huge lines of people waiting to go into the theater. But then there was also a group of protestors there with signs, ban the film, and pornography and stuff. The movie itself could be difficult to watch. And it's very much of its time. It's kind of like an experimental film. - The code started crumbling in the '60s, 'cause the '60s were the '60s. I mean there was a lot of upheaval in our society. We had a president shot, and a lot of things were going on in real life that didn't match the strident mores of the code. And people were rebelling against it. - And as in physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. (calm music) They said "We need to have a rating system in order to determine who can see these films." - We are not censors at all. What we do, and we don't make value judgments. There's not one of our ratings that means a film is good or bad, it just indicates the level of content. And then we give descriptors along with the level to show all those elements that are present at that level in the film. - There was that general feeling of change from the old classic Hollywood which pretty much died around 1962 or '63. ♪ Greeting greeting greetings ♪ - 'Greetings' came out in 1968, and it was the first film to be rated X. It's a counterculture comedy. Robert De Niro starts to get involved in being a peeping Tom. - You've heard of pop art. - Oh yes, sure. - Well, this is called peep art. - And eventually he figured out how to make movies using this obsession. The X rating definitely helped, they wanted the X. The sex stuff is mostly relegated to Robert De Niro's scenes where he's spying on women. But there's also a scene that involves Gerrit Graham, who plays the character that's obsessed with the Kennedy assassination, where there is a naked woman on his bed. And he starts tracing the bullet trajectory of the gun that killed Kennedy. - I did my first nude scene in 1968, in my first movie called 'If', with this beautiful girl. And I think it was the first time in a studio movie that a man and a woman had been naked together. So I went up to the director and I said "When we're fighting on the floor, wouldn't it be great if (imitates snip sound) just a cut and we're naked like animals?" And he looked and he went, "...You ask her." So we come to the end of the day, she comes out in a bathrobe, and just drops it. And I said "Hrrmp... Oh!" and they go, "Okay get your trousers off." And I went, "It's a bit cold in here...." And they, "Get your trousers off!" Well, the first assistant director, when we did the shot, walked off the movie. He was so outraged. Subversive stuff. This title of being naked the most of any young actor of that period, was thrust upon me. I did not go seeking it. - Any venereal disease? - No sir! - Rats? - No sir! - Lice? - No sir! - Go over there for the bath! - Yes sir! - It was just that I came along at the very moment that the floodgates opened, and they decided to allow nudity in movies. And about bloody time, it was ridiculous. I mean it was sort of the line that was never crossed. When that was breached, holy God it was breached. We all came rushing through. - If you haven't seen a Russ Meyer film, I would say you're in for a treat. His films were his own genre. - He's such a funny guy, he's just like so dry. He's like "Well—" real gruff, like, "Well she's a lot smaller than most of my girls, but maybe the women will be able to relate better." - Vixen is played by Erika Gavin. - Nudity was definitely essential in portraying who this character is. - And she's a nymphomaniac, and all these different people kind of come in, and they meet her. And she wants to have sex with every one of them. It includes her brother. - Remember how you used to wash my back Judd? And how we used to cuddle in the tub together? - We quit doing that when you turned 12. You said yourself, it wasn't right. - I don't care what I said then, Judd. This is now. - She's just filled with lust. - Like during the scene with myself and Vincene, Russ was down on the floor— "Give it to her, yeah!" Pounding the floor like this. Like... just pounding! He was laying on the floor pounding! And then he goes "Cut! Lunch. I gotta change my shorts." (folk music) - The late '60s, early '70s was when everything really changed. After Woodstock, when everybody was rained on, and was pretty much naked anyway. The floodgates began to open. - In fact, 'The Graduate', and 'Easy Rider', kind of opened the door, and all the movies that came before looked so old fashioned in comparison. - Of course American actresses did not like to do nudity. They thought that if they did, their careers would kind of be tainted in some way. - It wasn't whether or not you're gonna do the nudity. It was when you were gonna finally do it. - European actresses don't give a damn. I mean are you kidding, no way. Its just everything's off if it's part of the— the integral part of the script. - 'Women in Love', and there's a nude wrestling scene between Alan Bates and Oliver Reed. And it was weird, and shocking, and surprising. That's one of the few male nudity things that I remember seeing in movies. - When it was released in the United States, the American censors cut this scene to where you see Olie and Alan start to get into each other, and then it cuts to them laying on the floor panting. - Was it too much for you? - So what we get is probably the best known sodomy scene in a major motion picture, when it wasn't a sodomy scene until they cut it that way. ♪ Everybody's talking at me ♪ - The first X rated movie that became mainstream, and that actually won the Academy Award was 'Midnight Cowboy'. It does have nudity in it. But I think it's more rated X because of the subject matter. - So Sylvia Miles in 'Midnight Cowboy', is a society lady, and Jon Voight is a hustler. And they hook up and have sex. And the next day he asks her for money, and she freaks out. - You know Cass that's the funny thing you mentioning money. Because I was just about to ask you for some. - You were gonna ask me for money? - Hell, why you think I come all the way up here from Texas for? - Who the hell do you think you're dealing with? Some old slut on 42nd Street? And I think, sometimes I watch occasionally. It'll come on and I'll see that scene. It's hard watching it you know. I'm just so shocked at how real I was. In case you didn't happen to notice it, you big Texas Longhorn bull, I'm one hell of a gorgeous chick There was no arrangement made about nudity. No contract to deal with things like that. - And so you had brief nudity from Sylvia Miles, and from Brenda Vaccaro, who were two of his bolder conquests. - 'Midnight Cowboy' won an Oscar and was rated X. And that was the true application of the X rating, meant it was a more adult film. - In 1969, a film came out called 'Last Summer', that was X rated, and it was known for being a pioneering film because of the male nudity in it. - 'Last Summer' is basically four kids left to their own devices in a sort of a rich summer town. - Hey come on, let's go for a swim. Bare ass? - They'll see us. - Not here, up the beach, come on. - She'll probably go tell her mother. - At the end of 'Last Summer', the rape scene is basically very emotionally fraught, because we have been four friends. And sex has been just creeping up all the time. But we've both been pretty much in love with the Barbara Hershey character. - Major truth. I love you both. - Yeah, and I love you too. - And I love you too. - And she finally manipulates the pressure off of her on to Cathy Burns's character who's the girl. So it ends up being a shifting of power. It's like filming a fight, when there's a rape scene going on. It's like "How are we gonna choreograph this?" I especially didn't feel like a pioneer, when I'm over a close up of a handheld camera, on two two-by-fours on a slant, with Frank Perry yelling "Hump harder!" in my ear through a bull horn. Didn't quite think of myself as a pioneer. I didn't even really think about the nudity when I got the job. Being young, I was willing to do whatever it took to make a great film. People seem to forget we lived in a very different time back then. People didn't ask questions. You're either gonna do something or not— There were no rules. My uncle Alan, about six months later, said to me "I took your Aunt Levira to see your film. I look up and there's 20 feet of your ass up on the screen. We used to change those diapers, you know." I was never sexually thought of after I did 'Willard', for about 15 years. I kissed that rat, and that was the end of me kissing any leading ladies for quite a number of years. (calm music) - When Jack Valenti had first created the ratings in the late 1960s, he had not copyrighted or trademarked the X rating. He said, basically, "You want to self rate yourself X, without paying us a rating fee? You can go ahead and do that." This seemed like a reasonable solution at the time. But by the early 1970s we had films like 'Deep Throat', coming out that proudly self rated themselves X. Not just X but triple-X, and that bragged about it. - Once the, uh, pornographers realized that there was a rating that they could co-opt for themselves, that wasn't copyrighted, and meant adult— they were, after all, the adult film industry. And so I think they felt that it behooved them to slap the X on their product as well. - By the early to mid '70s there came to be a confusion in a lot of people's minds. What's an X rated movie? Is it hardcore pornography like 'Deep Throat', 'The Devil and Miss Jones', 'Behind the Green Door'? Or is it a Hollywood "adult" film like 'Midnight Cowboy', and 'A Clockwork Orange'? ♪ Singing in the rain just singing in the rain ♪ ♪ Just singing in the rain in the rain ♪ - Now there's a few things in 'Clockwork Orange', Just cutting this cat suit, and that was enough to sell that, you didn't need to do anymore. I mean just to say, "Viddy well little brother, viddy well." I mean, that's all you have to say. - Viddy Well, little brother, viddy well. - And this kind of confusion realized itself, you might say, in the pages of the local newspaper. If you wanted to go to a movie, you looked up where it was playing in a newspaper. Well, for example, the Los Angeles Times. They got protests from their readers protesting "Why are you advertising 'Deep Throat', and 'The Devil and Miss Jones'?! Our little kids are being corrupted by this!" And so the Los Angeles Times became one of the first newspapers to ban X rated ads for movies. - Another early Hollywood film that featured male full frontal nudity was a movie called 'Drive He Said', directed by Jack Nicholson. - I'm going. - Hey! (screaming in foreign language) - In 'Drive He Said', Michael Margotta does a nude streaking scene across a college campus. And that was pretty new for the early 1970s, and pretty shocking. - This was probably the first time you saw, except for the Oscars, where we had a streaker in that as well during a David Niven speech. - Quite likely— (audience laughing) - The '70s, with its hedonism, and also sort of the crass commercialization of that freedom, brought about exploitation films, as well as art films, and then just regular Hollywood movies where it was liberating for actors and actresses to get nude on screen. - In 'Carnal Knowledge', you have huge mega stars like Jack Nicholson, and Ann-Margret doing nude scenes, wanting to do nude scenes specifically. And it kind of gives tacit approval to all kind of American stars doing nude scenes in films. ♪ Bye bye birdie ♪ - Ann-Margret was a dancer who had dated Elvis Presley, and had been in 'Bye Bye Birdie'. And she had done no nudity in films, and it was rather surprising in the movie 'Carnal Knowledge'. - Where Jack Nicholson is in the shower in the background. And Ann-Margret's lying on the bed. - [Barry] And she's reading the newspaper, and she turns the page of the newspaper. And as she does that she lifts her arm, and her breast is exposed. - And she gets up and goes to the shower. And you see her from behind, but you go wow, that's Ann-Margret and she's naked. And that was like, whoa. - A lot of times after the actresses kind of broke their screen nudity virginity, when they finally did it and saw that it wasn't that bad, or that it didn't hurt their career, and they could get through it, then they started doing more and more nudity. Ann-Margret followed up 'Carnal Knowledge' by doing a nude scene, a topless scene, in the movie 'Magic', with Anthony Hopkins. - 'The Last Picture Show', from Peter Bogdanovich is a remarkable movie, a wonderful film. And it also partakes of these kind of new freedoms of this period. - I know there was a lot of talk about the freedom of the screen. And my producers on 'The Last Picture Show', which we shot in '70, really wanted nudity, and the sexual aspect of the story, as they did in 'Easy Rider' the year before; the same producers. It's a story about a small town in Texas in 1951. - What y'all doing back here in the dark? - The kids are coming of age. - You see frontal nudity in it as the people from the high school take off their clothes to skinny dip. - You wanna join the club? - Sure. - Well, you gotta get undressed up there on the diving board. - [Tommy] So everybody gets to watch. (cheering and whistling) - Cybill Shepherd was not sure she wanted to do it. - That's the rule. - Yeah, I did it last Easter. - [Agnes] Okay? - Okay. - But Bert Schneider, the producer said, "If she doesn't want to do the nude scene, we don't want her in the picture." I said "No, I'm going to cast her. And we'll see about the nude scene. Maybe she'll do it, maybe she won't. If she won't, we'll get a double or something like that." I wasn't gonna give up her as an actress. - It's wonderfully in context of the film. It's not at all exploitative. It really works with the film. - We sort of fell in love, and actually that made it tougher for me. 'Cause I wasn't sure I wanted to do that either. The scene in the swimming pool, nobody was there except Cybill, and me, and the camera man. - Did Peter need to have Cybill Shepherd be naked when she jumped in the pool? Probably not, but it is a way of telling a story that's different than it would have been if she had clothes on. So I mean, you can use nudity to make story points. (all cheering) - I could be completely murdered for saying this, but Europe is like the land of the 18 year old actress and the 50 year old man. And this is like a sort of love story that makes sense. This doesn't make sense in America to American audiences. This is something only Europeans seem to really do. You don't see that as much here. - 'Last Tango in Paris' is a movie that stars Marlon Brando. He is looking at a French apartment for rent at the same time a young French woman is. And they agreed to rent the apartment and meet there just for sex. There's been a lot of talk about what the scene is where he sodomized her and uses butter as a lubricant. Schneider claimed it wasn't in the script, claims it was sprung on her. She said in an interview "I felt as if I was being raped," something like that. - The press around this movie. Did he really have sex with her? Did he mistreat her? Did he anally penetrate her? - Everything outside this place is bullshit. - It certainly put butter on the map. - Stop! - If you go back to her interview, it really is that's a leap from what she's saying. I mean she stayed in touch with Brando, they were friends. - Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here. - And I would describe her in that movie as nude instead of naked. There is something about her that's coquettish. And she's playing that. - All the mysteries that you're ever gonna know in life are right here. - The women in prison genre began, actually in the 1970s with Roger Corman. ♪ I'm a longtime woman ♪ ♪ And I'm serving my time ♪ - These were films that starred a wonderful actress named Pam Grier. - Where do you want to be buried, nigger? - And it's Miss Nigger to you. - Pam Grier should rule the movies. I mean if there was any justice in the world. - The first one, I think, was 'The Big Dollhouse', 'Women in Cages', 'Twilight People'. And then 'Black Mama, White Mama', and then 'Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', and 'Sugar Hill'. And then I had a three picture deal woo-hoo!. - And Pam Grier became the number one action, kick ass lady of the '70s. - And it was basically just a standard prison plot, but it was women in prison. - Something has set in motion, something where these women are deprived of their freedom, and their put all together in these terrible situations. - The cobra's venom attacks the nervous system. The victim dies in convulsions. - And they were frequently naked. - Does this do a little thing for you? - [Mike] And always rebelling at the end to get their freedom. - These movies became wildly popular, especially in the Deep South, and the Midwest. - And European was more accepting in nudity. the Rubenesque, Sophia Loren, you could show a little more bust on her. In America they go (gasping) oh my God. When I was in 'The Arena', they gave us an option to turn face the camera, just act like you're really showering, you're bathing. And I said "Well, I'm not gonna cover up, like the other characters are." They're gonna pull your clothes off. And I had to be mentally prepared to have that done, because it had been done to me as a child. - The hint of promised lesbianism, if there were no actual lesbian scenes. - Okay, that's enough. Hurry up so you can get out of here and fix my hair. Women in prison oppressed, they're gonna explode with sexual appetites and attraction, and they're just gonna be borderline. Well, yeah that's for when you oppress anybody for a while. And then plus they didn't have wardrobe. We just had T-shirts. - And since nothing succeeds like success, they would churn out as many of them as they could. - [Announcer] 'Caged Heat'. - Your guess is as good as mine as to how I got that part in 'Caged Heat'. We have a violent sorority here. (shirt tearing) And very strong ways of dealing with it. - You can't do this to me. (electricity crackling) (groaning in pain) - I mean yeah, it was rough. For some reason it's like people that go to watch women wrestlers, they love seeing all those shower fights, which is where the nudity would come in. The shower scene was really treacherous, because of the fact that there was no hot water. It was freezing cold, and here we were naked. - 'Alice in Wonderland' is the innocent blonde girl who goes into a trippy psychedelic world of talking animals. - Hey wait, I'd like to talk to you. - I can't wait when I'm late. I'm supposed to be at the Queen's party at 3:30. If I'm late it could mean my (mimics cutting) The Queen's a bitch, tootaloo. - And blood thirsty Queens. - You misunderstand me, doll. I don't want to cut off your head. I want you to give me some head. I think that that fantasy world was her journey into sexual discovery. She was a lot like me. She was young, naive, and I could relate to that. Mr. Rabbit, wait for me. - [Mike] And she's incredibly beautiful, incredibly radiant. - I remember when I got the part, I was so excited. Like, "Oh my gosh, I got my first film!" Right? "Yay!" But I didn't have an agent. I didn't have an attorney. I signed a contract; I don't even know what I was signing. I shouldn't be doing this. If I had issues with the nudity when I read the script, I don't remember. It was a role, I was playing a character. And the character needed to be naked. - If it feels good, it is good. Learn to trust yourself. - I grew up in La Mirada, and there was the La Mirada Drive-in. There was a spot where you could see the drive-in movie. - It looks nice. - It's very nice. - Indubitably nice. - And there were other kids there too. And one of the kids was like, I'm gonna bring binoculars next time. I was like, "Oh genius." And I remember my parents were like, "Oh, what do you want for Christmas?" "I want a pair of binoculars." - When I was a kid, a teenager, we'd sneak into the drive-in and you'd see an R rated movie. You expected, you demanded nudity. There better be some gratuitous nudity here. Just all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the actress would drop her top. And is it something that would play as well now, as it did back then? Probably not. - And then 'Alice in Wonderland' got an R rated release. - Which is where, then it became popular, because it obviously had a much larger audience. - That reflects the 1970s, that it was so libertine that they could show a soft core porn movie projected in public in a drive-in theater. I mean if that happened now, without a doubt, there would be, I mean you knowTwitter would explode. - Take off your clothes. - I don't like women giving me orders. - [Announcer] 'I Spit on Your Grave'. - Camille Keaton was a model who had been in Italy. And she made one of the classics of horror, that was called 'I Spit on Your Grave'. - Camille Keaton is what they call a scream queen. And a scream queen is an actress of a certain age, that began her career being chased around by guys in hockey masks, or what have you. That's a scream queen. (grunting) - I can't believe that I'm sitting here 40 years later, and we're having an interview about this film. Now that means something to me, I have chills. The plot of the film is about a woman that goes off to write her book, and she goes to the country. Shortly thereafter, in the secluded area she's in, she gets raped by four men. Stop it, stop it. (grunting) - And she's stripped, and totally exposed, and then sets about for the rest of the film to seek revenge. And so there are a number of scenes of her taking off her clothes seducing men, and then exacting her revenge on the men who had raped her. (grunting) - We were the first to make a film where a woman does go back and get revenge on her attackers. - They're all about remaking European movies, usually Ingmar Bergman, like 'The Virgin Spring'. When you realize where these movies, what the inspirations came from you go, whoa. I mean this is kind of Toney for a trashy exploitation movie. - Well, when I read the script I was very excited about it. Here is a script that can give me the opportunity to cry, be vulnerable. I can be everything, I can kill. The nudity, that worried me a little bit. I loved everything else about the film. She's a strong character. (screaming in pain) The director and I were talking about how these nude scenes would be made. And there was a lot of trust and respect between all of us. It came out in Chicago, and immediately was banned in over 200 theaters. And I think it had to do with not just me being nude, what happens to me in the film, the rape, and the revenge. and it was so real like. But what she did in the film is certainly to show women that they can be strong, and that they can face their attackers. And I think they do that today, more. - Well they talk about, in the '80s slasher films, the final girl, who was usually a virginal figure. I believe that's all about 'Halloween'. - 'Halloween' might have started this craze where the good girl keeps her clothes on, and she lives. But the bad girl gets undressed, or has sex. - Oh, fantastic. - [Irv] And she gets slaughtered. - A lot of teen guys, underage guys, were allowed to see slasher films. They were not allowed to see teen sex comedies. And the irony was, why is it okay to see people being killed and slaughtered, but not okay to see a naked body having sex? - What I find so funny about this idea, of the good virgin who keeps her clothes on, is Jamie Lee Curtis herself has made so much fun of it. And her big quote is that she didn't show her tits until she went legit. It wasn't until she moved out of horror films into serious movies that people started to ask her to take her shirt off. - By the way, food and rent are not the only things around here that cost money. You sleep on the couch. - Jamie Lee Curtis was not the only star to kind of perform in these surprising nude scenes. Take somebody like Malcolm McDowell, who went off of movies like 'If', and 'Oh Lucky Man!', and 'A Clockwork Orange', to take the really controversial lead role in 'Caligula'. - Malcolm McDowell will always be remembered for 'A Clockwork Orange'. But he will also live in infamy for playing the title role in Tinto Brass' 'Caligula'. (squeals) - Do I know what the plot is of 'Caligula'? I haven't got a fucking idea. And it's a fascinating part of Roman history. - All anyone remembers from it, is how mad Malcolm was. - And I didn't want to play him as a madman, because that's boring and there's no. If he's mad, he's mad, that's it. There's no moral issue with it. - [David] Sleeping with his horse, having sex with his sister, burying people up to the neck, and then cutting their heads off. All these scenes of torture. - We kind of came up with this thing that he was an anarchist, that he was destroying the Roman Empire from the top. Sound familiar? - Caesar, emperor of Rome, lord of the world. - Lord of the world? I didn't want to do any nudity in Caligula, because everybody else was nude in that movie except me, pretty much. And they go "Would you—" I went "Nope. Nope. Everybody else can, and I'm not going to." So that's the way that was. I know, I said it's pretty stupid, if I'm in a rainstorm, not to be naked. So I figured that was okay. But no making love to this, I didn't take my stuff off. - More conviction. - 'Caligula', which was I guess, one of the great porn movies of all time. We didn't know at the time, but that's what it became. - It is a pure X rated movie, back when X meant something. - I hated it because somewhere, when you watch that movie, you realize there is really a wonderful movie here that's been sort of hijacked by Bob Guccione, who was the publisher of Penthouse. But he had absolutely no taste. And all you had to do was look at his magazine to figure that out. - Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren are all in this movie. - I know, he hates me. - Because you are wise. So, when I am gone, watch out for Macro. - He figured if I've paid for these sets, my business is pornography. Hey, let's shoot a porno movie. And the shot would be of me close up. When I shot that shot, I'm looking at a pet falcon. So cut, two lesbians in the 69 position, licking, and God knows what else, at it, humping, writhing around. Come back to me, quizzical smile. And I sat there with Mary, my then wife. And we were like "Holy fuck, what is this?!" - There was a landmark movie in 1979 called '10', which was directed by Blake Edwards, the husband of Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews. And the idea of the movie is looking for the perfect 10. Bo Derek became the go to actress in the nude movies of the early '80s. And if you went to a Bo Derek movie, you would expect that several times she would disrobe. - George. - I think in the history of cinema, it's always been considered much more artistic and acceptable if the actress does nudity, as opposed to if the actor does nudity. - I think this is this hypocritical side of the business. And indeed, men in general, isn't it? Of course we want to look at this beautiful, voluptuous body of a woman. But a man with a penis hanging out, who wants to see that? It doesn't have the same sort of beauty. Or not, at least, to a heterosexual man. (calm music) - Nudity in American films is slowly becoming more like your European films used to be. - And then we go through this kind of Renaissance of directors like Paul Mazursky, and Paul Schrader with 'American Gigolo', with a new kind of freedom. - What's amazing about 'American Gigolo', which was a very popular movie in 1980, is that the star of the movie, Richard Gere, showed his penis. - So it still remains, I think to this day it's a little bit of a, I don't want to say scandal. But it's a little bit shocking and surprising when a major male star consents to do nudity. - Blake Edwards made a movie called, 'S.O.B'. about the movie industry, and put his wife, Julie Andrews, as the star. He played on the fact that Julie was a squeaky clean, Disney heroine who never swore, and was just the sound of music. ♪ The hills are alive with the sound of music ♪ - The movie is a huge flop, and there's no nudity in it. And he decides I'm gonna put some nudity in it. And the only kind of nudity he could come up with that would be daring, or would be box office, is to have his wife show her breasts. (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - [Mat] It wasn't a long nude scene, but it was Mary Poppins naked. And that is an exciting thing to see. - That was all done for comedy. Yeah, I just think it's a great send-up of Hollywood. But Hollywood doesn't always like send-ups. - 'The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood', right. Well it's Xaviera Hollander, who I never met, unfortunately. But I was the third hooker. The first one was Lynn Redgrave. Then there was Joey Heatherton, and then there was me. - [Announcer] There back again, Xavier Hollander and her girls. Money comes easy to the girls of Xaviera Hollander. - Bouncy, bouncy. - So Martine Beswick is an actress who was in tons of films throughout the '60s and '70s. And in fact she was in a lot of Bond movies. She was in 'From Russia with Love', and 'Thunderball'. - Tell London I've made contact with the girl. - Well, it's not what I'd call contact. - Let's face it, it's about a hooker. I mean, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna pretend that she's gonna have it off with someone dressed? - [New York Cop] Boys downtown were right, Xaviera. You are the best. - Do they really say that? - Oh yeah, and more. But of course, they're very respectful. - Of course. It's always a pleasure to serve NewYork's finest. Actually, it was really a cute script. And it was about a film within a film. And it was about Hollywood trying to undermine this woman. - And I gotta tell you, one of the most campy, great nude scenes of all time happens in that movie where Martine Beswick is completely naked at the side of the pool, rubbing oil on Batman, Adam West, while he smokes a cigarette. And he's completely naked, by the way, as is she. Only in the late '70s, early '80s would you do a nude scene that was this weird and crazy. But it's classic. (dramatic music) - 'The Howling', from 1981, is a great— one of the great werewolf movies ever made. - And one of the conceits of the movie is that during sex is a particularly propitious time to turn into a wolf. - They're coming from each side of the screen, and the fire is getting bigger and bigger, and they're both naked. - The sex scenes are not all that much fun to do. There are certain visual aspects that need to happen in a sex scene, and things that you need to be able to see, and not see, and not be covered. And then when they're on top of each other, they're animals now. Do I think the scene would have worked without the nudity? Probably not, that particular scene no. Because the whole scene was engineered toward the fact that we were seeing this woman naked. And it's also a beautifully lit scene, and it's very attractive. And it's sexy in its way. - Yes, 'The Howling II'. I was contracted to do that nude scene. And started out with the ripping, I call it the rip away, the rip away dress, where I tore my dress open and then we have a threesome. - So they make her like a blonde werewolf. She's in kind of a bodysuit, but they've got hair glued all over her breasts, and down here. Kind of a bush down here, fur. And you'll have to ask Philippe Mora about that, because he's a crazy guy, and he directed the two sequels. And they' re snarling at each other, and Philippe was going, this is got to be the first three way in werewolf history. (dramatic music) - 'Personal Best' is, I think, the best movie I've ever seen about the athletic experience. Margaux Hemingway plays this track and field athlete. And she falls in love with an older woman who is also an athlete. - It was controversial, there's no question. It was the first film of its kind. - But this is a film that explored a lesbian relationship, not just as something that was part of a male fantasy, or in some sort of soft core film. And the subject was treated with respect. - There was enormous controversy about this. I mean it was Margaux Hemingway's doing a sex scene with a woman. She winds up with a man at the end of the film, which was a claim that lesbianism is a phase. But the last line of that movie restates the women as the important relationship. - The nudity was again a little more akin to what real life was all about it. If two women are in the steam room, and they're athletes, they're probably not gonna have towels that go from below their knees to their chins. They're probably gonna take the towels off, and be naked, and just continue to talk. - Nudity is expected when the story supports it. It's really not about, I need this gratuitous moment of nudity to accentuate this. Now, there have been movies, and there are tons of them, where that's definitely the reason why they put it in there. I would say that 'Star 80' affected my career far more than 'Personal Best' did. 'Star 80' was more difficult for people to watch. - It's about this meteoric rise of this girl who worked at a Dairy Queen in Canada. - May I take your order noW? - I'll like something sweet, soft, and white, you. - [Mike] To Playmate of the Year, and then co-starring in a film by Peter Bogdanovich, with whom she also had a romantic relationship. - You shouldn't chew gum, it's got sugar in it. - [Mike] That ends horrifically, with pimp-y husband, Paul Schneider, murdering her with a shotgun. (gun fires) And violating the corpse, and then blowing his own head off. (gun fires) - And in a film like 'Star 80', nudity is absolutely necessary. It's like, well, in a Playboy movie, or a movie about about Playboy. - That's called the bunny dip. - [Eric] You're gonna see some breasts, it's their life. - There was a big misinterpretation about howl got the role. - It was so much attention over her breast augmentation, it was ridiculous. - Yeah, I wouldn't have gotten the role, had I not had breasts, that's absolutely the truth. - She had that done for the movie. Yeah she did, and so? - But! did it for me. I wouldn't have done that because of a movie. - August. - Oh Mr. Hefner, thank you. - I gotta be honest with you. When I first got the script of, 'Star 80'. I thought it was horrible. - What's wrong with him? - Well, he's got the personality of a pimp. - But it's Bob Fosse. - Bob Fosse did not want me for that role. You're Tom boyish, you're from the mountains, you're not a Playboy, you're not a sexy, girly type girl. And I wasn't. And that's exactly why I wanted to play her. - I had a certain manager, kept saying why aren't you a star? Why aren't you still a superstar? And I said "With what movies?! With what work?! There is no work!" And he put me in a certain movie called... - [Announcer] 'Chained Heat'. - There is a scene with John Vernon. Got a little too excited. And I'm gonna be as polite as I can about this. He didn't follow the rules of working with stunts. (slap lands) (crying) He hit me hard. Not okay. No. The movie I signed to do, was not the movie that we were filming. They kept giving us script changes. And I'm thinking, this is not okay with me. My feeling is, I would rather see a breast, even a penis, then I would violence, that's me. (laughing) - The reason I think that the women in prison movies were so important— especially in the '80s—where 'Rambo' and 'Commando' was coming out. Women in prison, that works worldwide, translates very well. - This is what we need to do, this is what is selling. - Well yes, I mean we weren't doing 'Shawshank Redemption'. - [Linda] If you didn't agree to something, you weren't gonna work. - There is actually a list of what the producers, the directors, and the distributors want. "We need three shower scenes, we need two rapes, we need this, we need that." - You know, for 'Valley Girl', it was simply a distribution deal necessity. - Atlantic Releasing said it when I met with them. And they said "Well, we've made them agree. You are going to show naked breasts in four scenes in this movie." - It was, like, in the contract as nudity. We need three sets of boobs in this particular film. - "Is that a problem for you?" I said "No. Is it a problem if I do it whatever way I think of?" And they said "No, we don't care how we see them. We just want to see them." And so they would send me little notes: "More breasts." - My manager, who was a woman, said to me, "Oh actresses do this all the time, it's very common. And it's okay, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about." - When I read the script, I was like "Oh yeah, I'll do this movie, but I don't want to do the nudity. They can probably just get somebody else in the movie." - And I thought that was interesting, because a woman is saying that to me and not a man. - And then I remember my agent at the time saying, "Okay well I'll talk to them and tell them that." And then what happened was my agent didn't talk to them and tell them that. - I was skeptical. Is she saying that because she wants me to get the job and do the job? Or is she saying that because that is how it's perceived in the world? - Years later, it's all over the internet forever and ever, for the rest of my life, which I don't mind. 'Cause I've done total nudity in movies. But to me I don't want to be the pair of boobs for that distribution deal, I want to be the pair of boobs 'cause it matters to the scene. - Well, I kind of felt like nudity was an important element in the sex scenes in 'Fast Times', because it would be uncomfortable. - Yeah, well, the scene with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the dugout with the older man, very tough scene to watch, very hurtful, very realistic. - This is not how you wanted it, or imagined it. And your mind is not in the space that makes you feel the way you thought you would feel. I thought when I got lucky enough to direct a movie that I would be able to show it from a different point of view. - She takes nudity, and intimacy, and the messiness of being a young person trying to figure it out. And she looks at it through a couple different angles. - It's strange, you have to tell them exactly what they're doing, where the hands are, where they're touching what. Because it's almost like, more than in other scenes, they need the permission to do the things. And then to see a naked guy for the first time, would be quite a freak out for a young girl. But as it turned out, I was not allowed to do that. And they said "If you have that shot, you'll get an X rating." When I saw the scene cut together, it did not occur to me, like, "Oh that's an X rated scene." To me X rated meant porn. So we had to blow it up. So just like in every other film, you saw a guy who's topless, which is nothing essentially. - I think I came. Didn't you feel it? - Yeah, I guess I did. - So it was cut way down. And they said "See? It's better now." Like "We improved your scene." And, I'm like "Thanks a lot." - I don't know if we could make it now. Back then some of the objections might be more from the right wing, kind of conservative Christian side. Now, the objection might be more from the left which is, well, if someone's having sex, someone's being exploited. - I mean distinguishing between essential nudity, and exploitation nudity is really tricky, because sometimes they clash even in the same film. - To me the greatest nude scene in the history of movies is Phoebe Cates in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Judge Reinhold then steps into the bathroom, takes a peek out the window at Phoebe Cates in this luminous red bikini. (dramatic music) - Hi Brad. You know how cute I always thought you were. - You know, I feel kind of uncomfortable about the whole thing because I didn't want to be, oh I'm the one that's insisting that she do a topless scene, but it was in the script, and it was a scene that was needed. Because we wanted to show the big disconnect between what the fantasy is, and then the humiliation of it not being that. - Oh, wait just a minute. - And I really told her she had to talk to the producer, Art Linson, who handled it. - Doesn't anybody fucking knock anymore? - I think the scene works, and I think it helps the humor of what happens to Judge Reinhold after that. - [Announcer] What they're teaching in private school isn't private anymore. Especially at the Cherryvale Academy for Girls. - Are are feeling romantic now, my darling? - 'Private School' is a classic bawdy farce plot. Three guys dress in drag to sneak into the girls academy. - You only go around once in life, and you gotta grab for all the nookie you can get. - Well, first of all Phoebe Cates, she was my idol. She said, "Are you... are you worried about the nudity at all?" And I said, "Why would I be worried about the nudity?" I said "It's a great role, I'm not worried about it." She said "Oh good, I'm so happy, 'cause I was naked, like, 25 times in 'Paradise'." And we just hit it off. - 'Private School' also contains one of the best remembered shower scenes, because it goes on and on. - So there's a boy who's dressed as a girl, who's hiding in the sauna. And he's voyeuristically watching all these girls take showers. And in the movie you see me in the shower a long time. Then you see me in the locker room getting dressed. Then it cuts back, and I'm in the shower again. I did so many shower scenes, that I always thought of myself as the cleanest actress in Hollywood. - Phoebe Cates and Matthew Modine, they were excited about losing their virginity. And then my character, Jordan, was interested in Matthew Modine's character. So I tried to steal him away from her. - The scene of her horseback riding is maybe the, I don't know whether to say the high point or the low point. But it's the something point of gratuitous nudity. - [Linda] Surprise. - [Richard] Because not only does she take off her top and ride on the horse, but then they give us a slow motion replay. - I said "How about if my helmet falls off? And then my hair can blow in the wind in slow motion." And they said "Oh we love it, that's a great idea." When am I ever gonna look this good again? Why not have it on film for the rest of time, where I can remember, "Oh my gosh I looked great?" And I had no problem with any of it. - Okay, 'Last American Virgin' is a movie that is very unexpected. What do you do if two best friends fall for the same girl? She winds up choosing to be with the guy who's more popular. Gary is the guy who's shyer, maybe he's not as confident. But he falls for her as well. And it's a very simple story, it's a story that I think happens to a lot of people. - Listen, will you count me out, Rick? - Hey, do you want to get laid or not? - Look, I'd rather screw Godzilla than them. - The love scene in 'Virgin'; I think what I really loved about it, it was slow. And it was gentle, and it was beautiful. Again, guys would not come in and see this film unless they thought, I'm gonna get to see some girls naked. And then they learn about this beauty, this kind of romantic aspect to it. It kind of lures guys in with the nudity aspect. - [Mike] The movie is crazy, it's full of pranks. - That's nine inches. - Oh my God, I'm having a heart attack, help! - Mel, can I borrow your breath spray? - I didn't want to be typecast as someone who just did nudity. I didn't have the the choices that women do today. And I'm very happy to see that women today have the choices where, they can choose to do nudity or not. If a woman's comfortable with it, great. and if they don't, that's fine too. It doesn't mean you're going to be given more or less of an opportunity. I think it just has to do with who you are. - 'No Way Out' is a 1987 movie, and it's where I think a lot of people really became Sean Young and Kevin Costner fans. - You're pretty impressed with me. - No. - Yes, you are. - I remember Roger Donaldson said at the end of the audition, when he finally offered me the part. He said "Well, lift up your shirt let me see. I wanna to make sure you don't have any scars or anything on you." And so I was like, "Okay." And it was really ridiculous on a certain level. It's not like you could say to the producers, I love this part but I don't want to do the nudity. That was, like, you had to do the nudity, because that was what they were banking on as part of their sexy project. - The key scene in that movie, and the one I think fans of '80s sex scenes remember, is in the limo when they're driving around Washington. - Well, I remember doing the love scene and thinking how retarded it was that I was the only one undressed, and Kevin was nervous. Kevin was really nervous. And I remember turning to him and saying you're dressed, what are you talking about? Get it together, would you? - There's a scene early in the movie that's really sexy where Sean Young is in a mink coat, and just opens it up in the hallway of her apartment. - Hey now, you better beat it before I get arrested. Bye, Nina. - Oh, nice meeting you, Tom. - People thought it was a really sexy scene. And they thought it was kind of humorous, and casual, and very comfortable. And it's interesting because that's kind of good acting, where really you're in a situation where you don't really want to be, and you're trying to make it look comfortable and and authentic. You don't have to say anything. You never say a word. So the double edge is, always in show business, is you want to be attractive enough that people want you to be naked. But you want to work with people that aren't gonna abuse it. - Traci Lords is obviously famous for being a porn star who got into the business underage, and then all of those films she made quickly became illegal. About 1987, she did a movie produced by Roger Corman called, "Not of This Earth'. - It was my first mainstream, leading role. And it changed everything. - Actually when you get to know me better, I'm really a sweetheart of a guy. - I bet Attila the Hun felt the same way. Well, when I read the script for 'Not of This Earth', it was clear where there was nudity in the film. No Tommy, not here. - Oh, you gotta be jacking me? - I was jacking you before, now I'm just telling you something. As in all of Roger Corman's, or at least the ones I've seen, and Jim Wynorski films, you always had the female character that somehow manages to lose her top at some point. And what do you do to earn your keep, 'sides hassle nurses? - [Jeremy] Most anything. - Such as? - [Jeremy] Such as fixing meals that Johnson never eats. - I mean all kinds of bizarre ridiculous scenarios. - Why don't you take off them glasses? You wouldn't want to miss any of this. - That's just the way that they had their formula. That's what they did. (girls screaming) And for me it wasn't that big of a deal. It was never a conversation that I had with the director, or Roger. It was, here's this lead role, do you want this? (calm music) - 'Henry and June' was the first film to receive an NC-17 because that was the first film we happened to see that hit that level after we trademarked the rating. - Then all of a sudden X just became a subset of the rating system that became so onerous that they had to actually get rid of the X rating altogether, and change it to NC-17, which is kind of a toothless rating. - 'Henry and June' is about the author Henry Miller, who wrote a lot of really tawdry novels. And so his life, which included his wife June, and he having kind of a strange polyamorous sort of three-way relationship with Anais Nin, another author of sort of erotica. - And Henry and June took full advantage of that NC-17 rating with the lesbian scene between UMA Thurman and Maria de Medeiros. - Fred Ward, plays Henry Miller, is naked in quite a lot of that movie too. And I applaud the fact that the the sex scenes were not, they didn't pull back Because the authors and the people in question were so kind of open about their sexuality 'Bad Lieutenant' from 1992. And this movie also got an NC-17 rating. But Harvey Keitel is an actor who has appeared nude in quite a few movies. But this one was the most kind of out there. And he looks like a guy at the end of his rope. Not just a bad police officer, but he is a drug addict, he's a murderer. He's just an all around bad person. - [LT] You fucking stand there, and you want me to do every fucking thing. - Keitel is drunk, and he's very naked. It's not disgusting because he's naked in it, the character is disgusting. You know what's coming 'cause it's so infamous in that movie. But it's a powerful moment for that character, I think - In 1992 the movie 'The Crying Game' was released. It really became a hit because of a surprise, a secret that was supposed to be kept about some big revelation in the film. - And it's like the song "Lola", you know, "She walks like a woman, and talks like a man." (calm music) - [Dil] You did know, didn't you? - It was stunning. And it was done so brilliantly, and it's a beautiful film, and it's a great film. But I think it also played off of the fact that we expect to see certain things in movies when it comes to nudity. We're taking male sexuality, and we' re playing with it. And that makes most men very uncomfortable. - No, don't ask me in. - Please, Jude. - No, I can't pretend that much. - It says as much about how we expect to see things in movies as about the movie itself, and the characters in it. - In the early mid 1990s there was this just cluster of erotic thrillers. - There were so many movies where women became empowered. - 'Basic Instinct' is another film that had the kind of publicity you can't manufacture in advance. - Are you sorry he's dead? - Yeah. I liked fucking him. - You've got Michael Douglas. - Games are over. - Playing a sex addict in the movie. And he just literally is up to his eyeballs in Sharon Stone's charisma. - It's really really rare, and certainly at the time for any actress to do that graphic of a nude scene, where she uncrosses and crosses her legs, like that. - It's one of the most famous and iconic scenes in contemporary cinema. - But the scene that was really surprising to me was the beginning. It wasn't just that she was naked and to be a tool of some other man's sexual gratification. She was naked, and murdered a man. And so that juxtaposition of clearly intentional, clearly acting and planning out her plans but also naked is stuck in my mind. - One of the most empowering images, or nudity in film that I can recall, or the first thing that really struck me was Julianne Moore in 'Short Cuts'. - It's more like she is so in her scene that she has no idea that she's bottomless. So it makes the scene funny, and real, and gives me more empathy towards her. - I wonder whether anybody would even be in the mood for a drink if had to drive around half the night looking for an open market. - Did he kiss you tits, did you touch him? - Touch him? Touch him? - She has done so much nudity in so many different films that it just seems like it's part of her career. It doesn't seem like she's exploiting it, or being exploited, it's just that she's an actress who is completely comfortable with doing nudity. - When the empathy is apt, then you know it's necessary. When when the empathy is drained out, there's objectification happening. - 'Showgirls' is just an old fashioned Hollywood story, about how a gal comes to Vegas and wants to get naked so she can become a star. I've seen it a million times before. It actually, basically, is 'All About Eve'. - Did you enjoy that out there? - Yeah darling, I think I did. - I hate yo u. The Rena Riffel, Elizabeth Berkley, lesbian pole dance. Between the lighting, the music, the bumping and grinding, the reaction from the crowd. It encapsulates everything 'Showgirls' is about. - It's like jumping off a cliff, a short small cliff. And, um, like "Okay, I'm just gonna do it!" - Paul Verhoeven, and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas wanted to make the movie NC-17, deliberately. They wanted to get that rating. - Was I just taken advantage of, and I thought that I was being a really great committed actress, but really they were just turning me into like a softcore porn kind of performance? That movie has, like, ruined my personal life when it comes to relationships. I get, like, nudity shamed all the time. - When you do this, when you're a smart director, you make the audience accept it. You're not saying look, they' re naked. Okay, they're naked, they would be naked. The same way as if you were making a movie about construction workers, you'd expect the characters to be wearing hardhats. It really is the same thing. - So, Demi Moore in 'Striptease'. The nudity was interesting, because she didn't look anything like she did in 'About Last Night'. The reason is she had breast implants, and I think she felt really good about herself, she looked amazing. Obviously did those nude scenes, with Burt Reynolds especially, that people remember. - You just don't know how much I worship you. - How much? - I wonder if you could look at the trajectory of nudity over one actress' career? - You can absolutely trace an actor's career via their nude scenes. Take Teresa Russell, for example, where she started early with 'Straight Time', then Nicolas Roeg's 'Bad Timing', then 'Eureka', then 'Black Widow', then Ken Russell's 'Whore', and 'Wild Things'. And a very eclectic group of films from there as well. Kathleen Turner shocked everyone with some explicit nudity in 'Body Heat' from 1981. And that was all essential to the plot. As her career went on, she was seen in essential nude scenes in 'Romancing the Stone', 'Crimes of Passion', 'A Breed Apart', and 'War of the Roses'. 'Tess' provided Nastassja Kinski a lot of acclaim in 1979 with an essential nude scene, although she started much earlier than that in 'Stay as You Are', and 'Boarding School' in 1978. and then her career kind of exploded to feature other important nude scenes like 'Cat People', which is maybe her most popular film. And somebody else whose career you can trace via their nude scenes is Melanie Griffith, who appeared in essential nude scenes in, 'Something Wild', 'Nobody's Fool' with Paul Newman, 'Night Moves', 'Body Double', and quite a few other ones. - A distinction needs to be made about attitude when you advise an actress to take a role and take her clothes off. If the representative's, or the producer's, or the studio's thinking is heartless, and not regarding the artist as an artist, then bye, not good. - Kate Winslet was nude in, like, probably her first 20 movies. - The first time an actress is nude in a film, it's a big deal, she's showing herself, she's vulnerable, she's sensitive, she's emotional. And then it's hard to kind of reconcile her nudity with her mind of a character. - Like there are movies where she did full frontal nudity and everything. And they were quirky, and they were great. And it, like, really showcased her as an actress, that sort of was comfortable in her own skin and everything. - 'Titanic'. It was a— it was one of the biggest grossing movies ever. And the nudity in that was confined to Kate getting her portrait painted by Leonardo. And it was what we would call tasteful. - And being a movie that families, and everybody were going to see, I think when that moment occurred they figured we were gonna get the traditional 1950s era shot, where we saw the naked back of the woman, and the guy would see it, and that'd be it. But no, we actually saw Kate Winslet's character topless. - 'Titanic' was a very, very interesting film for us, as far as nudity is concerned, because in our board we had mostly all PG-13s, except for one or two of the fathers. - But it's a beautiful moment, and it's true to the story. And it's actually one of the most important scenes in the movie, because it's the moment where we realized that she's gonna be herself. Surprising that it got through, but it was the right thing. 'Boogie Nights' was made in the '90s, but it's actually largely set in the 1970s at the height of the porn industry, when filmmakers were making literally hundreds of porn movies, and showing them in theaters, because this was before the internet, and before even cable TV or anything like that. - It, I think, gave a very accurate picture of what it's like to be on a porn set, and the chaos wrought of the switchover from film to video. - No no, we just keep shooting. This is video. We shoot, and shoot, and then we deal with it later. - Paul Thomas Anderson, who directed it, has this amazing cast, with Burt Reynolds playing kind of the father figure who makes all these movies. Julianne Moore is his wife, who also still appears in porn movies. And then Heather Graham plays roller girl, who dropped out of high school, and she still is on her roller skates, and is becoming a pretty big porn star. And then Mark Wahlberg, who is discovered, classic Hollywood style because he has a certain gift that you just can't fake. - He becomes the star of porn in the '70s, and then he gets embroiled in drugs and crime, and everything like that, everything that kind of was bad about the post '70s porn industry. - I want to fuck! It's my big dick! So everybody get ready fucking now! - It's also very true to the subject matter. You can't have a movie about the porn industry, and then cut away when there's going to be the sexy scene. So the first time Mark Wahlberg's character is introduced Heather Graham's roller girl, and Burt Reynolds is there with them and says "You guys want to go at it?" And she just whips off the clothes, and skates over, other than the skates, completely naked. - Are you ready? - Yeah, are you? - Oh yeah. ♪ Your window last night ♪ - Are you gonna take your skates off? - I don't take my skates off. And don't fucking cum in me. - Okay. -Aim it at her tits, Eddie. - Spoiler alert, this movie came out 20 years ago, if you haven't seen it. But eventually we see a lot of reaction shots to people reacting to what Mark Wahlberg looks like with his clothes off. We finally get the money shot, so to speak, at the end. - The end is, it's a gloss on the end of 'Raging Bull'. - I could have been a contender, I could have been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am. - He's ready to go on to film a scene, and just to check his confidence he unbuttons his pants. And you see for the first time what everyone has talked about in the movie. - [David] What's he supposed to have, this giant penis. So it was a custom made giant penis, and we all got to see it at the end. - Looking in the mirror. And then when he stands up, his head's cut off. So it's like the personality's gone, he is his penis. - The end of 'Boogie Nights', I won't kid you, we received a lot of comment about, after we rated it R. But I have to share with you that the comments came from the media, not from parents. They thought it was a true rating. They thought it was right on. - The rebirth of sex comedies was 'American Pie'. There hadn't really been many for a while. - Illegal channels? - This is just a bad reception. - [Television] Oh, spank my hairy ass. - What's that? - [Television] Ooh, baby. - You know what here, just give me this please. - The new generation coming up hadn't really seen those movies of the '80s. So it was the right time, right place. And then it sparked a big genre, again going in the next wave. - We all get laid before we graduate. - And it's relatable because we all go through that stage of life. - That comes easier for some than others. One that it does not come easy for is Jason Biggs in the lead, who at one point asks his friend, Steve Stifler. - What exactly does third base feel like? - Like warm apple pie. - Yeah? - The most famous scene in the movie, of course, involves Jason Biggs attempting to make love to a warm apple pie, and getting interrupted by Eugene Levy, his father. - [Jim] Oh yeah, oh. - Jim? - It's not what it looks like. - Nadia's the foreign exchange student. She's just like everyone else, finding herself, and her sexuality, and boys. - You need to change, right? - Do you mind? - No, no not at all. Please you know just go ahead and get un– get changed. - If I hadn't done 'American Pie'— and I hadn't done the role of Nadia, and the nudity that came along with it— I might not have a career today. - The scene of her stripping down on the webcam is like, that's burned into the memories of, like, kids who were in high school and in the late '90s. - So rather than, as in 'Porkies', the guys spied on the girls through holes in the wall, in 'American Pie', the guys spied on the naked girls using the internet. - I mean kids are taking pictures of themselves, and putting it on the internet all the time. So it's not as big of a deal. You see it online every day, you see it on Instagram, or wherever. I didn't really think about the fact that my character had nudity. I was a struggling actor, I was auditioning for everything I could. So when I got the role, I was just so excited to get it. I tried really hard to just go in there and not be nervous. We added so me stuff that wasn't actually in the script. So, like, when I walked to the mirror, and I'm topless, and I'm looking at myself, I kind of look at my stomach and think you know I'm not happy with the way I look. 'Cause that's what girls do. Doing 'American Pie' and the role of Nadia, changed everything for me and my career. I ended up getting a three picture deal with Miramax because of it. - Looks like you could use an extra hand. - Jim! - Well— - Shame on you! - [Jim] Yeah.... - So if something comes in now, it is important what kind of project it is. And then what kind of nudity is it? Is it important for what the script's about, or is it gratuitous and they're just throwing it in there to get some kind of a rating? - And so that was kind of like, "Hey let's— we can do this again!" And there were so many that there needed to be a parody movie a couple years later. (calm music) - I thought "What a funny role! I don't think I can get naked," like "I don't think I can do that part of it." - So, you've got your class schedule, right? - I don't need the class schedule. I only come to this school to be object of lust for poor nerds who cannot get American pussy. - To spoof the gratuitous nudity in 'American Pie', they just had Serena Vincent walk around the school completely nude. - As though foreign exchange students are supposed to be naked. - [Girl] 100% completely fake. - [Girl] I agree, that's not her natural hair color. - Oh my God, I can't believe she's wearing the same outfit as me. - I remember telling my agent, like "Can I read for a different role?" And they said "No, this is the one they want to see you for." - But she went to class nude, walked the halls nude, went to prom nude, went to the sporting events nude. - She gets to sing a little song topless. ♪ Look at me my breasts are perky, yes ♪ The comedy made it more fun for me, and less intimidating. However, shooting nude scenes are one thing. That's like one beast. Dealing with the world judging you afterwards was something that I wasn't prepared for. I started off on a kids show. I started off the Yellow Power Ranger on 'Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy'. The most interesting thing about the Power Rangers was that a lot of Power Rangers fans were offended that one of my next big roles was, 'Not Another Teen Movie', and 'Cabin Fever', because there was nudity in 'Cabin Fever' as well. I was offered many many roles after 'Not Another Teen Movie', and 'Cabin Fever' that were all about being nude. So, that's an interesting part of the business, is like what casting directors, and what the business, and what the world sees you as, as an actor. But then watching yourself on the big screen, totally naked, I wasn't prepared for it. I didn't think about that part. - I wasn't ready to walk into a theater and see myself naked that big, on a big screen. - And I attribute that night of the premiere to me becoming very ill, to the point of where I almost died. Seeing myself that big on the screen, I became totally anorexic and I went down to 76 pounds. - And then also I wasn't prepared for the entire world picking your body apart. - It was really something, I had no, I had no clue that something like that could happen. - 'Terminator 3' is about John Connor, who has been living off the grid. The Terminator actually is his ally, and helps John Connor from getting killed by the evil new cyborg: the TX, which is me. - We have Kristanna Loken nude, in the opening credits sequence actually, where she lands from another time. And there's a car that pulls up, this beautiful sports car convertible, and naked she walks through the street to the car, and she car jacks it. - I like this car. Well, I was familiar with the nudity in the Terminator franchise, what we would call the birthing scene. When Arnold's character comes to Earth for the first time from the future, and Robert Patrick's character. And I figured there's not gonna be anything different with my character. But I was just glad it was the very last day of filming, and I had all that time to get in the best shape of my life. Women that are powerful, and that can match men or best them in battle, it really stand out. What price do you put on your body, and what are you willing to get naked for? It's easier for a man to just have his shirt off, you know, and not have anything thought of it, other than a woman, even if they're in bed together, which I agree, the bed sheets up here, it looks weird. - No, I don't want to be known as the actress who just does nudity. And I didn't know if anybody would take me seriously, or let alone give me roles that didn't demand that. - As a woman if you have your eyes open, and you have a good solid brain on your head, you can do it. And there's nobody saying that you can't, in this day and age, except the women themselves. - So there's theories of humor that say that what funny things are, are benign violations. They're violations of how the world should be. But they're not threatening. So, for instance, Ken Davitian in 'Borat'. You're not used to seeing really heavy dudes running around naked. And so perceiving that makes you feel uncomfortable, and that kind of feeling of a uncomfortableness leads you to think of it as funny. - I had no idea who Sacha was. I had never seen an Ali G. But I know! auditioned in character, dressed with a suit that I wore when I was 360 pounds. The nudity that we did, I never saw written on any paper. The big superstars gonna run around naked, and I made sure he was naked because he did it. So I'll be darned if I'm not gonna do it. - The sequence where Borat, and Ken Davitian's character, who is a very large man, he's over 300 pounds, and having, having a naked wrestling match that just keeps going, it just goes on and on, and doesn't shy away from. I mean that's a movie that earns it's graphic nudity MPAA rating. - That scene with Ken Davitian and Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the funniest nude scenes I've ever seen in my life. (speaking in foreign language) - We had a naked fight coordinator. The television, a lamp, they were all stunt equipment. So he could hit me with it, I could hit him with it. I said, "If I'm naked, people are gonna go like this. They'll go (grunting)" And they said "Yeah, that's what we want." It was the first time, and the only time I had control of anything. But Sacha's the one that wanted to go to the cliff and jump off. Those are my testicle. Sure he's gasping, but I wasn't farting out gas for him to die, it was just a little accident. - We made this movie called 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno'. There was a little bit of nudity in it, more so than any of the other movies I ever made. But not, it's not graphic. It's certainly a misleading title. You're not seeing any penetration in, 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno'. - What? - We're making a porno, and we just need to know what you would be, or would not be, interested in doing. - If anything. - No anal. - Oh, definitely no anal. - Anal and hugging. - I don't do ass stuff. - Anal. - Oh fuck. - Oh wait, oral, I like anal. - Yay. Title got the movie greenlit. But then when it came time for the movie to come out, some networks were like "We won't play a commercial for this before midnight." - You can see the MPAA putting its fingers even on just the topic of porn. Because they had initially wanted Kevin Smith to cut the words, "Make a Porno", out of the film and just call it 'Zack and Miri', which means nothing! The draw of the movie is that these two schlubs want to go make a porn to save their coffee shop... or something like that? Anyway. - With this mailing list we have almost 1,000 people that would definitely buy a porno we were in, just to be like hey I sit next to the guy in Civics. Look at his fucking dick. - There's some adult actresses, former adult actresses in the movie. You had Traci Lords, who was obviously infamous, although she's not nude in the film. - So a movie, huh? That could be fun. (calm music) (flatulating) (funky music) - Her name, Bubbles. - When you look at a film like 'Zack and Miri', I think that comedy and the nudity that are actually in 'Zack and Miri' were perfect. I mean the scene wouldn't have worked if she hadn't been fully bare and there. - Kevin Smith ran into a lot of problems, just trying to get the movie distributed and marketed. - If it makes you uncomfortable in any way, you don't have to show me anything you don't want to show me 'cause. I love the movies. - You might wander in to see a movie called 'Zack and Miri', if you're my mom, not knowing that it's about what it's about. And then all of a sudden you're "make a porno"? - It's such a shame, because I think it's one of his better films, that people were so afraid of the title. But people are afraid of sex. And maybe they're a little bit afraid of nudity, too. - [Mike] There's a billboard for 'Zach and Miri Make a Porno', with Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, and they were just stick figures. - Katie Morgan gets kind of naked, and then Jason Mewes gets really naked. Jason Mewes goes full dick out in that movie, man. He shaved his pubes into a heart. I remember when I showed the movie to Affleck. Nobody had ever said this, entire time I'd shown people the movie and stuff, nobody ever noticed. Soon as the movie's done Affleck goes, "Did Mewes shave a heart into his pubes?" I was like "You were lookin'! You were lookin' awfully close, weren't ya?!" - Anybody that read the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' books, all the suburban housewives, they were going to the theater and weren't expecting nudity? Come on. ♪ I know if I'm onto you you must be onto me ♪ - It's kind of funny because the movie is so vanilla. - You're a sadist? - I'm a dominant. - What does that mean? - It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself. - I think filmmakers keep the ratings in mind all the time now because they sign a contract at the beginning promising to deliver a film rated R, or 13 or less. - I will 100% stick up for 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. There's a huge difference between the way Sam Taylor-Johnson shoots a sex scene, and a lot of the '80s directors would shoot a sex scene. '80s directors are like, "Here is the body, isn't it beautiful?" And Sam Taylor-Johnson says "Here is a bit of fabric. Do you want to imagine what that would feel like?" She's asking you to use your imagination to bring yourself to the scene. - They worked very hard to suggest, rather than show a lot of graphics. You'll see how they did it very skillfully without getting an NC-17 rating. - It seems, in life and in the film industry, there's this correlation between nudity and attractiveness. You want to see the attractive people naked. But that pairing then leads to bad consequences, such that people are like "Well, to be naked you have to be attractive." - Nudity isn't just limited to the young, or the perfectly proportioned. You don't have to be a perfect 10. - It's really nice being in your 50s as an actress, because nobody actually asks you to get naked anymore. Or very rarely. Usually an actress in their 50s doesn't really want to do a nude scene. - When we see older actors or actresses get naked in an everyday setting, so Kathy Bates in 'About Schmidt'. - And she did a movie with Jack Nicholson, who seems to bring the sensuality out in older women. And they get in the hot tub together. And Kathy Bates strips off completely, and climbs in a hot tub with Jack Nicholson. And you see her both entering the hot tub, and then sitting in the hot tub with him, which was kind of surprising at the time. - Oh, that's better. Oh, what a night. - The look on Jack Nicholson's face, it's like, the easiest read on that is like, it's an ugly body. But I think it was that feminine power, and that confidence, that women are supposed to be somehow ashamed of not having that perfect body. And Kathy Bates like look, this is me baby. I'm in the tub with you. I mean it was brilliant. (calm music) - Right now we're in a very interesting time, where people are very aware of power dynamics. - The destruction of the accepted paradigm in Hollywood in the last 18 months has happened faster than probably in the last 100 years of the movie business. - Since Harvey Weinstein, and the Me Too movement got underway, we've definitely seen a lot more talk about what can be done to make actresses, and occasionally actors, feel more comfortable on a set. - I am finding that I am being hired more by studios. And other intimacy directors are being hired more since the Me Too movement. - A filmmaker knows now, "If I have nudity in my film, it will be absolutely cross examined by the internet." - None of us are excited about why we have come to the forefront. We are all thrilled to be part of the solution. - "So I need to make sure I have a reason for it. I need to justify it. I can't just have cheap nudity in this film for no reason." - Everything's been upended because all of this institutionalized sexism, and harassment has been coming to light. - No, and I don't think we ever want to get in a situation where people say "We can't have nudity in films or television because it's too problematic." That's a problem. - And now there's more of a system of checks and balances. - You want people to just sort of feel like whatever they're doing they signed up to do. - I think that's good, just in terms of every artist should be cross-examining everything they do. I think there were a lot of boobs that were not cross-examined. - And I think things are changing very quickly because, again, there's just such a light shone on Hollywood right now, post-Weinstein. I don't think that executives have a choice anymore. (all talking at once) (calm music) - I was going towards the set down a corridor in the studio. And I see, at the end of the corridor, Gielgud came around, running down, going (grunting) "Malcolm! Oh Malcolm! Have you been on the set?!" I said "John, I'm just going to the set." He goes, "I'd never seen so much cock in all my life!" (laughing) - I went back through my resume on IMDb, and I'm like starting at the bottom, which was the '80s. Okay nude, nude, nude, nude, nude, nude, not nude, nude. I actually counted. I did 35 nude scenes in films. But I've done 185 movies. - One of the strange things about the rating board was, what they never did, was that after you came back and showed them your new version of the movie, they never went to see it in a theater. So at Corman's we had a practice of making the cuts that they asked for, showing them the print, and then immediately reinstating all the cuts and sending the picture out the drive-ins. And almost all the movies that came from New World at that period that are rated R, are pictures that actually are X rated cuts. - Barry Diller was the head of ABC. And he came over and talked to me about 'Picture Show'; said they wanted to run it on the network. And they had cut 11 minutes out of it. The scene with Cloris Leachman, when Tim Bottoms and she make love the first time. I said "As he starts to get on her, go to a commercial. And when you come out of the commercial, he gets off." And they did that, and it was very funny to me. "Go to a commercial while they're fucking." - Larry Charles said "Go through those black doors, and the stage is in front of you." That's the direction we got. When I ran, I slipped and fell. And therefore, he fell on top of me. Because the one thing we didn't do is prepare for afterwards. Two detectives from the actual hotel, came and took me out, and he said to me, "When we get to the end of the steps, get into the blue van." I mean this guy's taking me to jail?! Yeah, I don't know what they did with Sacha. But nobody thought about me! I was sitting there freezing! There's nothing in the van to cover yourself with! There was no contingencies made previously, to any concerns about being arrested. They were all made (hands clap) on the spot! - Did you see a film called 'Blue is the Warmest Color'? I saw that movie and I was like, I was shocked because I was watching these two women go at it, spanking each other, and they scissoring each other, and all this kind of stuff, and I was like "Holy cow! Now there's a movie I could never do!" - I did a movie called 'The Naked Monster'. And they decided to add in a gratuitous shower scene, but it was satirical. So my character Nicky, the narrator says, "Suddenly, Nicky felt compelled to shower for no reason at all." And I'm like looking at the camera going "What?" And I'm like "You, get out of here." - So shooting in the actual house that Dorothy was murdered in, and where Eric Robert committed suicide in, meant it gave it more of a texture. - And the day before we shot the murder scene in the actual place where it took place Bob Fosse and I spent the night there at his request. And I'm asking him while we're lying there. I'm in the bedroom, he's in the living room, and I said "Why are we doing this?" He said "Because I want to. Shut up." - Filming in that house was horrible. Nobody made me spend the night there. I would've, I couldn't have done it. - It was freaking me out, I got maybe three hours sleep. But I think that's what he wanted. He wanted me on, he wanted me uncomfortable. He did a good job. He wanted me uncomfortable. (calm music) (Io ud stomping) (elephant trumpets)
