Hey! Hey! The school is closed. We're on holiday. I'll call the police. OTTO THE BARBARIAN Tavi! Tavi! Tavi, can't you hear when I'm speaking to you? There are some people waiting for you. Something about child services. Let's go! Come, Tavi! Come on! Thank you. Please excuse us. Please, come in! Nicu, invite them to take a seat! - Please, do come in! - Costin Penea. - We are neighbors. - We are? Yes, Compozitorilor Street. Monica Hărăbor, my colleague. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See you next time. - Whatever you left, you'll find here. - Please do come in. What is this about, actually? As I was saying earlier, we are from Child Services, 6th district. This is regarding Laura Mușatescu. We would like to talk to Octavian about what happened. Let's take a seat. - I'll make you some coffee. - No need, thank you. Don't worry, there's no bother. Have a seat, Mr. Penea. Thank you. Octavian, sit down. I'm making some fresh coffee now, this one is a bit cold. Octavian, please tell me, what was your relationship with Laura Mușatescu? Otto. - I beg your pardon? - Otto. Octavian's colleagues call him Otto. Otto, please tell me, what was your relationship with Laura Mușatescu? They were friends, good friends, right? Octavian, you are studying at Sava high school, right? Yes, 12th grade. We are graduating this year. I'd rather hear Octavian answering, if you don't mind. - Of course. - Otto. Tavi, that's enough. The procedure is that if we can't speak with the witnesses, we need to bring it up to the Prosecution. - God forbid, it's not the case. - It's a stupid procedure. It's bureaucracy, but we do have to obey it. Tavi... Is there any reason you don't want to talk to us? Is there any reason why I should? We are just trying to understand what happened and why. And we are asking you to help us. Is that ok with you? Come on, Tavi. All these questions are meant to help us understand the circumstances of the situation. Vera, would you check that coffee, please? Of course. Sava Highscool, you say? I was in class B, with the nerds. You study sciences, don't you? Yes... I studied Physics with Botea and Romanian literature with Grigore. - Is Grigore still alive? - Yes, he is. He wasn't the easiest to live with, but anyway.... Eventually I didn't end up studying sciences I was more interested in humanities. - What do you teach? - History. School no. 52. Otto, we are not the Police, nor the Prosecutor. We are interested in covering the basics, to cross off an ABC list. In order to understand the general circumstances. We are not looking for culprits. We are looking for a portrait of the victim. - Thank you very much. - Sure. Thank you so much. Here you have some sugar, if you need it. Let's see what does it say here. Were you a close acquaintance of the victim? Yes. How would you describe Laura's state? Did she seem sad, depressed? Aren't these questions a bit too personal for a multiple choice test? The victim was always happy. How would you describe Laura's relationship with close ones? Friends, family? Good. Did she express any negative thoughts, or did she tell you about her problems? My answer is C. May I ask you to expand on this, in your own words? The victim did not express any negative thoughts and whatever else you said. Be civil. Are you aware of Laura ever practicing self-harm? B. B! Did Laura Mușatescu tell you about her plan of committing suicide? - Yes, several times. - Tavi! Octavian, did your colleague tell you about her plan? We even made a drawing of it. Together with Mr. Botea, the Physics teacher, we calculated the maximum tension of the rope. Tavi, my God! - Do you want to see it? - Stop it, already! Octavian! This is very difficult, such a nightmare. We understand, but it's very important for us to know. Otto, did she tell you about her plans? - No, how could it... - Were you involved in this story? No. Please write down his answer. We apologize for these questions, this is the nature of the questionnaire. Father! Vera, please take care of this. Father! Bubu, come on, let's go to your room. Otto, if Laura had told you about her plans, what could you have done? A ballad. - Tavi, that's it! - No, I understand, don't worry. He plays in a band. Saw it on Facebook. Ok, that's about it. We understood. Let's go. - You didn't even drink the coffee. - It's ok, thank you very much. I understand you and I understand what she went through. I really do. - I do apologize for... - Thank you for the coffee. No worries. You didn't even drink it. - We apologize for... - No worries. Thank you. Goodbye. Come to the living room for a second. Tavi... Can you tell me what happened earlier? What do you mean? Why do you think those people came and asked you all kinds of things? - I don't know. You tell me. - I don't want to tell you. You did understand for yourself. I want you to stop with the attitude. The fact that we know you and accept your behaviour it doesn't mean that everybody else should understand you. - Do you understand? - Yeah. - Yeah, what? - Yes, comrade Nicu! Oh, boy! Nobody can't talk to you anymore. Tavi... I'm asking you to get some sense in your head and to stop with all the nonsense. It doesn't make you more beautiful or smarter, and it doesn't reveal any transcendental pain, like you think. Tavi! In such difficult times, it's easy to lose yourself, Tavi. The sane thing to do right now is to make a plan, to focus on what you have to do: on the finals. You'll soon graduate. - Tavi, you'll have your final exams. - Anything else? Do you see how many kids are passing through this living room? Why doesn't any of them behave like this? They all respect me, they consider me their friend, they ask for my advice. - What's the problem, Tavi? - "What's the problem, Tavi?" - What's your problem, I'm asking. - What's my problem? - Yes, explain it to me! - "Learn, learn, learn!" Are you afraid that I'll end up as a loser, a failed teacher at a neighborhood school? To wait on morons to study? So, to you, I am a loser? Thank you. I'm keeping this for a while. If your father is so bad, or whatever you think about me, it stays with me for a while. - This house needs some rules. - Sell it online! Wanna see a trick? What do you think? Do we have a spark? Tavi! Where are you going? Who can understand you anymore, kiddo? Hit that car! Smash it! Good job! One more! Let's go! You have other cars, too! What, are you pissed? Smash all those cars! Bubu, let's go to bed. Otto! Hi! I didn't know whether to ring the buzzer or not. I called you. Why don't you answer? What do you want? Marc was saying that they're going to rehearse somewhere else. Somewhere on Manu street. Good for him. I have things to do. - Please! - Get on with your life! Otto! I don't want to have anything to do with you. Get on with your life! Finish it! I'll wait for you to finish smoking. No, you go ahead and eat. I don't want to eat, right now. It's very good. Your hair looked before. Or with side bangs, like the trend is. Emo style? I think it would fit you. Now you're like a hedgehog. Otto! Please! See you tomorrow? Will you lock the door, please? Hi! Can I drop you somewhere? Would you help me, please? Thanks a lot! Wait! Now that you know where I live and you are around, give me a call and let's go have a beer. Hi! Is your father also asleep? Dunno. I can't even smoke, anymore. I'm going to bed. Leave the rest of the dishes. I'll wash them in the morning. - Is it on? - Yes. Wanna see a trick? - Not really. - Close your eyes for a sec. I don't want to. - Get down! - Don't turn it off! If you film me, I can't cease to exist, right? Get down! I killed myself last night, too and I only got these bruises. Get down! Do you have any cigarettes? Get down! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Would you like some coffee? May I help you with something? - Mirela? - Yes, Ioana! Hi, Mirela! I brought you some moussaka, my dear. Forgive me, I look like... Don't worry, I'm not staying for too long. I just came to bring you this moussaka and to tell that I have talked to the priest. Would like you some coffee? No. You know I have high blood pressure. Actually, yeah, but just a sip. Take a seat, Otto. Mrs. Ioana from apartment 9. Otto. I have talked to father Elefterie. He'll do the ninth day service. Church ordinances, what can you do? Is anyone coming? I can help you prepare cabbage rolls or whatever you need. You girls have always been so lonely. I'll bring the nice coffee cups. Maybe you have things to do. We wouldn't want to keep you. I've talked to father Elefterie and he was very kind. I've explained him and he didn't object. You should be nice with him when he'll come. I gave him some money, but not too much. I'll go change and be back. I cannot stay any longer. I'm leaving. You can bring me the bowl when you finish the food, ok? Or I'll come and take it. Bye! It will surely be a total chaos. Yeah, you guys, but we still need to rehearse though. - When, dude? - I don't know, man. On Thursday or Friday if you want. I'm busy during the weekend. - Are you aiming for a prize? - I'm getting ready for the festival! - What festival, dude? - That one where he's jerking off... Shame on you that you don't know! Otto, dude, I'm really glad that you came back to us. Yeah, man, me too. I'm really sorry about the situation with Laura. I was thinking that... from this song we could make a sort of ballad in her memory. - Bullshit... - It could work. Something like "Boulevard of broken dreams". You're listening to Green Day, now? Maybe I've chosen the wrong words, but there's something.... - You better leave it. - The sad guitar part might work. Some lyrics and with the sad guitar part, like you said... A ballad and a handjob. That's a good line. I would go for the handjob... - You don't get to think of her! - Otto, stop tripping! - Screw you and your shitty concert! - Otto! Look at that one! Did the wind blew your hair from both sides? Bye, Bubu. Otto? Come on, have a coffee with us. Look, Ana was just telling me about the popular mnemonic system for the finals. Do you know it? Come on, show him! How was it? In Calinescu's.... In Călinescu's work the novel identifies itself and reveals its personality... Isn't it funny? It's great to have you both here. Reason for celebration, really! Would you like something to drink? Some soda? Maybe there's some beer or wine left from... Look, there's some Coke... It's a bit warm. To you, kids! This shit is good. Actually it's not... 'cause it eats the calcium from your bones. A cigarette? - Come on, take it! - I bought some. I'll pay you back. Come on, have one, don't be shy! Otto, you're at home. You're free to smoke here, it's a safe space. Anyway, you are so grown up and you know it all much better than us. Here. I like the minty ones... Bang, and what a change! Ah, I just remembered! Good, not to forget. What are you doing here? I've put it aside. Laura told me you are coming to get it. I forgot about it. Put it on! I'm so sorry! Otto! I didn't mean to! What do you want? - Otto! - What do you want? Tell me! - Please! - What do you want from me? You took her jacket, you shoved the pictures up her throat... All this for your fucking altar! She was my friend too, don't you get it? You think that I don't suffer? That I don't know what you are feeling? When was she your friend? When was that? When everything was nice and great? And you went to parties? What the fuck do you know about your friend? Don't you care about me at all? Fuck you! Laura! Wanna see a trick? Wait! Are you scared? Don't worry, Bubu. Hi! Hello! Home alone? I hope I'm not scaring you. You're not scaring me, either. I prefer to talk to you first and not to your folks. I went to the repair shop to change my car window. It takes a week to get a new window. It's ok. In case you were wondering how upset I am. I'm not. I have insurance. Is this yours? What do you want? I don't want anything. I just want to talk. What you did the other night doesn't happen without a reason. And I want to understand. I don't know what you're talking about. What I'm talking about? About destruction of private property. There aren't too many punks with Mohawks in the neighborhood, Otto. You're the only one. So what's with that icon? Are you religious? Do you believe in God? I like boobs. You're funny. I took some classes as well but I only play harmony. I didn't have such strong beliefs like you do. Punk not dead! So you do believe in God? Are you from the Jehova's Witnesses, and I don't know about? I lack humility. And the tie and the brother. And sister. What was her name? I saw that you left the file in the car. Did you find what you were looking for? What was I looking for? I don't know. Maybe you were trying to understand something about Laura. Or about yourself. A file like that won't give you the answers you're looking for. You're a smart kid with a chance to make something with your life. A Rublev. A what? - Rublev. Tarkovski. - Tavi! At least remember this from our meeting. - What if he would have left the house? - Hello! - Hello! Did something happen? - No, I was just about to leave. I am to blame for the door, I think. - Nothing happened so... - That's good. Do you have any more papers to sign or whatever you do? No, Octavian cleared it up for me. Thank you. - And is everything ok? - There's nothing wrong. - Bye, Otto. Bye, ma'am. - Good bye. - Let me just... - Come. Did you give Bubu something to eat? Yes. What did the guy want? Nothing. Are you ok? What do you want? What about you? I don't know. What do I want? Tavi, do you think we want anything else but for you to be happy? For me to be happy? That girl changed you. I don't recognize you anymore. Tavi! Pieces of truth I do not doubt. I know that... And they were renewed once every seven years. Pieces of truth I do not doubt. I know that... Did you like my trick? Pieces of truth I do not doubt. Pieces of truth I do not doubt. I know that... Bubu, do you have a cigarette? Wanna go for a walk? Did you see an old man? CLOSED Stop it, boy! Bubu! Bubu! Does he speak? He keeps silent. Turn right here. You're not much of a talker, either. Stop here. Thank you. You know, there are decent nursing homes. They walk them, they socialize and many other activities. Sometimes... this is the best solution. An old man who cannot take care of himself, completely changes a family's life. Your mom takes care of him as if he were a child. And this keeps her from living her life as a woman. You are frustrated, your father even more... He becomes a burden. What do you know about my family? About myself, Bubu, Laura? You write about the victim. The victim did this and that... What do you know about her? Where from? I don't know anything, but I want to understand. I thought you understood me perfectly. I'm not sorry for breaking your car window. It's fine. It's me. What are you doing here? I came to see you and you weren't here. I was waiting for you. I went to see Laura. I would just... Otto... I think you'd better not come here anymore. At least for a while. Yo! Yo! You fucking bums! Touch the floor and you die. - You are a barbarian. - Otto the Barbarian saves the princess. Sit and have a beer with your father. What else did the social worker want? Your mom told me he was here again. What did he want? He wanted to know why I broke his car window. Come on, Tavi, be serious. What did he want? He wanted to know why I broke his car window. You broke his car window? Tavi! - Vera! - What is it? Come here a minute! - Did you know? - What happened? Did you know... He says he broke the social assistant's car. How? I hit it with a stone until it was bits and pieces! - God, Tavi! - Tavi, are you kidding us? - Are you kidding me? - Stop it! - Are you kidding me? - What do you mean? Stop shouting, the neighbors will hear us. Did you really break his car window? The neighbors? Is your son embarrassing you? - Tavi! Tavi aren't you ashamed? - Tavi! On your birthday, mommy... Cut the crap! Did you break his car window? - Tell me, did you? - Aren't you ashamed, Tavi? Why, Tavi, why? You're dead and you don't even know it. Fuck it. - Good night! - What did you say? - Leave him, Nicu. - Good night. - Tavi! - Nicu. No Nicu! What? Is he crazy? How could he broke that man's car window?! - Put that shit out! - Get out! Put that shit out! - Get the fuck out! - Wait, wait! - "Get the fuck out"?! - Wait! Don't! I'm gonna straighten you up! "Get the fuck out"?! Do you have your Tavi now? Tavi! Otto. Nora. Come on in. Would you like something to drink? In the kitchen. Hi. What's up? Everything's ok? He's Otto. Otto the Barbarian. Barbarian? Cool! Barbarian! Why? Some Hun ancestors? - He's a cousin of Conan. - Or of Schwarzenegger. We are playing nice. Nice! Otto is a contemporary antihero. Right? Yes. Otto the Barbarian kills the princess and saves the dragon. Stefan the Great drinks his beer and eats his princess. Let me give you a drink. Come. Stefan is a colleague of mine at Child Services, 3rd district. - It sounds so official! - Nora is an economist. Econo-biatch? - And Elena is Stefan's girlfriend. - A lawyer-biatch. - Otto is my new friend. - We're sorry for him. I knew she was going to kill herself and I didn't do anything to save her. I knew. I had three patients who killed themselves. Three. Every one of them told me how, why... ... when... I suppose that the only thing that changed was the "when". What I really want to say is that... Laura was a troubled girl. Beyond this broad sphere of being normal. She was bipolar, if you ask me. Otto, the problem was with her, not with you, or with the others. - Only the lucky few escape from life. - No, Otto, it's not like that. Do you think she escaped? To escape means to understand, to heal, to be responsible. You don't screw the life of others around you. Do you understand what I want to say? I was there. She had the rope around her neck and I didn't want to save her. I didn't want to. You're scared, right? That's my song! It was a good one, wasn't it? Get the fuck outta here! - Stay the fuck down! - Otto the Barbarian. Enough, let me be. I want to be alone. Let go of me! Can't you see I'm choking? That's it, no more. Please let me go! I want to be alone. Let go of me! Can't you see I'm choking? This is now? It's this void engulfing me. Don't go! This is now? It's this void engulfing me. - Call an ambulance! Look at me! - Let's go home. - Are you ok? - He came on his own, right? - I don't know. - Call an ambulance, can't you hear? - Don't call any ambulance! - Can't you see what state he's in? Can you? He's high, can't you see? Do you want him to rot in a jail? - Come on, Tavi. - For a second I thought... You thought what? What? What is he doing here? You thought. How did he enter? That door is intact. - Let's take him home. - How did he enter? - He has a key. - What do you mean he has a key? He has the key to this apartment? He comes and goes as he pleases? Yes, here they feel good. Here they do whatever they want and they're free here... - They feel like home. - They feel like home... I've welcomed your boy. You kicked out my daughter! Tell me, Professor, why was my daughter not welcome in your home? Why? - Calm down. - Does she scare you or what? - Calm down. - Why? Let's go. I'm sorry. Come on! Pieces of truth I do not doubt. I know that all the cells in my body died and renewed once every seven years... I know that I gilded with myself my room, my things and you, in every inch of your body. I know that... I'll be glorious and that any gesture will be free from its evil and it will remain kind and warm in the memory. And I know that I will never be better than your remembrance of me, and I appreciate that you are here for me and that you forgive me, and that you love me.
