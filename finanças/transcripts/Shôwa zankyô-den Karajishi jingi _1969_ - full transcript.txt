TOEI COMPANY, LTD ASAKUSA BEGINNING OF THE SHOWA ERA Wait a moment, please. You are Hanada Hidejiro. Am I correct? Yes, you are. Allow me to make my greeting short. My name is Kazama Jukichi. I am presently under the Kaminarimon Family. I personally bear no grudge towards you... but I am under obligation. Thank you for your cordial greeting. This duel in under obligation. The loser will bear no grudge. SENDAI PRISON Brother. Glad to see you. How's the family? Is everything alright? What's wrong? Sorry, Brother. You sacrificed yourself to have me take over the family... but I'm not good enough to be Boss. What about the family business? Most of the young men have left for the Kaminarimon family. I risked my life to come see you. Please forgive me. What are you going to do now? I'll go to Nagoya and ask the Ishiguro Family for help. Brother? Stay with the Ishiguro Family until I serve out my sentence.

Please. Thank you. They can't do anything with everyone watching. You seem to have hard time giving those dogs the slip. They are so persistent. You've been too busy to notice... but we've been on the same route from Sendai Prison. Oh, really. - Yes. One of my family members been serving a sentence there for three years. I went to see him today. Thank you for the Sake. And where are you headed? Nagoya. Oh, Nagoya. You sounds like a Tokyoite. What brings you to Nagoya? I'm going to see the Ishiguro Family. Oh, Ishiguro. He's a very good boss. Do you know him? Well, just know him by sight. But good to hear you're going to him. By the way, I'm Hanada Hidejuro. I think you're the boss of well known family. No, I'm not such a big shot. But listen, although those guys might bother you, don't fight them. It's an absolutely waste. Not worth it. You're right. Boss, is Brother alright? - Yes. Hey. I was waiting for you, Kaminarimon Family. Don't be silly. I won't kill without a reason. Stop! I've been waiting for this moment for five years. You killed our boss. We won't let you live. I'm sorry for that. But your family's still messing with us, snatching our territory. Bastard! You take care of him. You're doin' so good, bro. Allow me to make my greeting short. I am called Tokichi the Weasel, quite well known in Kanto. You should know me. Sorry, but I don't. Well, that's okay. Just got out of prison, right? No wonder you don't know me. Got any money? Yeah. Let me take care of those dogs for you. One for 20 yen, two for 40. How about that? You'll take a fight for money? That's my profession. Too expensive. How about 30 yen? - Still expensive. I need money. I lost everything gambling. So, you're broke? - Yeah. I wouldn't mind giving all I have to you if you're a beggar... but you're a man, for god's sake. Show some pride, fool. He's the real deal. Hey, bro, you'll see me again for sure! What happened to your hand? It's nothing. It needs to be treated. Is there a liquor store around here? Why? I was going to put some alcohol on it. That's not good enough. Come in. Let me take care of it. But, Miss... You're not supposed to let a man in... It would be more troublesome... if you're standing there with bloody hand. And you have reason not to see a doctor, I assume. Come in. Geez, what a lucky man... Are you curious about a lady's room? Well, I hadn't see one in a long time. What you just said scares me more than your bloody hand. You aren't from here, are you? No. Thank you for the kindness. I'm going now. Wait a moment. It looks like it'll stop raining soon. Better stay here until then. KABASHIMA FAMILY The man who killed your boss was released? That's right. It's embarrassing to say but he's too strong for us. So we ask you for help. We can't save face unless he dies. Moreover, he'll do whatever against us in Asakusa. Your family and my family are in brotherhood. I will help you in any way... but I don't know who can finish off such a tough man. There is one in mind, Boss. But he's been drinking all day long. What a drunk. I'll keep him in mind for the future. He's really an odd one. Here you are again. Boss wants to talk to you, mister. Please come with us. Hey, Jukichi! Remember me? I'm Senta of the Kaminarimon Family! Tatsu's here. Don't you remember us? I remember you, stupid. You guys know each other? Yeah. He stayed with us for half a year. Good. You can talk to him then. Yeah. Jukichi, Hidejiro is in town. The guy who messed up your left arm. Oh, yeah? I got nothing to do with him. I know you hold a grudge against us. You think we turn our backs on you when you lost your arm. But that's not true. You couldn't beat Hidejiro, could you? I hear you! Jukichi... The family couldn't care of you because the boss was killed. Please understand us. Hidejiro is the enemy. Here's a chance for revenge. - Quiet. I beg of you. Finish of Hidejiro. Please! Please, Jukichi! Move away! Jikichi! Move away! Don't you want revenge? I'm not interested. Good evening. Underboss... - What? Hidejiro is a good man. I want to see him. Hey, Underboss. - What? You only have me now. What? Well, well... Sorry for you guys. Jukichi flat out rejected you. Shut up! - Easy. I will help you. Do you trust me? I know where Hidejiro is staying. Let me take care of this, Underboss. Really? - Oh, yeah! Good. How about 10 yen? 10 yen? Are you friggin' kidding? 200 is reasonable. - 200? That guy's so tough. Right? Excuse me. Tell me. Are you going to fight the Kabashima family? Kabashima? No. But their men are surrounding this house. Really? Oh, I see. Leave from the back door. Turn the second corner to... Oh, right, then you come to the main street. Got it. Thank you for everything. Please accept this, Miss. No. I'm not a women who charges for that. What? I mean, I'm not a nurse. I'm sorry. Sister. Anyone by the back door? No. Good. Hurry up. Hey, Mr. Hidejiro. Why do you know my name? I know because I was hired for 200 yen to finish you off. Sorry, but I'm in hurry. I have to go. - Wait! Why don't we do some business? It's not worth getting hurt. Give me 50 yen and I'll forget you. I don't have it. - Then... I have to fight you. Draw your knife. Go on. What? Draw your knife. I won't. Draw your knife already! I don't want to fight. What? Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Hey, wait! Don't screw with me! Did you find Hidejiro? - No. I just missed him. He must be around somewhere. Find him! - Alright! I'll go around the other way. - Let's go! Please allow me to make a short greeting. Easy, please. No greeting needed now. Come this way. Have a seat please. I'm Hanada Hidejiro of the Kuramae Family in Asakusa. Oh, the Kuramae Family. I'm Minegishi Ryuhei of the Hayashida family. You're the man my boss met on the train today, right? Here, have a seat. Thank you. I heard what happened to the Kuramae family. I feel sorry for your long sentence. My life was saved by the Kuramae boss. I was a young man and got in trouble at a gamble house in Takasaki. He was quite a character, a good man. Please make yourself at home. Hey, Kyoko! Yes? My sister, Kyoko. Nice to meet you. Bring something to eat. And, why are you going to Nagoya? Well, the young men of our family went to the Ishiguro Family of Nagoya. They've been waiting for me serve out my sentence... but shortly before I got out, they stopped contacting me. I've been concerned ever since. No one came to see you? Right. That's unusual. Hidejiro, I will go to Nagoya for you. Pardon? You shouldn't move around. It may stir up the Kaminarimon. You're the important man for your family. You shouldn't even catch a cold until you rebuild your family. Hey, come over. What do you want? No, not you guys. Hey, you're of the Hayashida, right? Yes, I am. I want to talk to you. - About what? Hey, why are you working here? We of the Hayashida Family are no longer... in the gambling or yakuza business. We decided to work for the town people. So you're not their bodyguards? No. We're here to help them. Then we'll kick you out! Hey, stop! This is our buisness, not yours. Yeah, not the Asanoya group's buisness. Good morning. Sorry I wake up late. Oh, let me do it. Thanks. That's enough. You'll stay with us for a while, won't you? No. I will leave before I give you trouble. Don't worry. My brother is a strong man. Oh, I'm sure. Someone saw him going into your house last night. Don't lie to me. Why are you laughing? I have to laugh. I asked you if he's here. You are the Kabashima underboss. I said he's not here. Don't press it. He must be here. You're an idiot! I wouldn't tell you if he was here. I'll lose face if I give into your threats. What? Hey you... and you. You know that man well, don't you? Underboss, those guys are no match with him. You need more men. Go back before he beats you. Get lost! Dumb ass. No! Don't do it! You're the important man in your family. I promised my boss to keep you safe from them. Don't! Brother! I'm alright. Bro! KABASHIMA QUARRY This is unexpectedly lucky. Good news to hear you finished off Hayashida's right hand man. It makes it hard for that old fart to stand against me. Well, but their family lost an underboss. They'll want revenge. Then we will wipe the Hayashida out. But Hidejiro will stay and fight along side them. Calm down, Senta. If he stays, we have more chances to get him. He is an outsider, not like Ryuhei of the Hayashida. Boss. Ryuhei was killed because of me. He lost his life to save me. No, you're wrong. Ryuhei was killed not because he tried to save you... He had been marked by them a long time ago. I am very sorry and thank you for everything, Ryuhei. I'm going now. Wait. I know you're going to fight the enemy. Don't go. We're not like that. It'll just make trouble. Boss. I am a Yakuza. I can't leave it like this. What about Nagoya? I beg you for Ryuhei's sake. Please go to Nagoya. Please. Boss. I understand. NAGOYA NAKA-SHI SAKAE STREET I understand. NAGOYA NAKA-SHI SAKAE STREET NAGOYA NAKA-SHI SAKAE STREET Thank you for accepting my greeting. Thank you for accepting my greeting. ISHIGURO CONSTRUCTION LTD Thank you for accepting my greeting. ISHIGURO CONSTRUCTION LTD Please allow me to introduce myself... Please allow me to introduce myself... to your boss, his wife and all the family members. I am from Kanto... a man from the Kuramae family, located by the Kannon temple. My boss was Hirate Jokichi, the second generation boss of the family. My family name is Hanada. Given name, Hidejiro. I am still a novice in the yakuza world. I would greatly appreciate if you welcome me. Brother - Stay in bed. Boss... Thank you for everything you did for us. My pleasure. But what will you do now? I'lll send you 30 of my solders if you go fight the Kaminarimon. Thank you. But Eiji is to take over our family. We can't do anything until he gets better. Brother. - Stay in bed! Eiji... I'll wait for you get well. Then, let's go fight the Kaminarimon, just you and me. I don't mind being killed to get revenge for our family. Don't you think so? Yes... You're a real man. Why don't you stay with us until Eiji gets better, Hidejiro? Boss. I have something to tell you... Asanoya... You better not place the bid, understand? If you don't bid this time, our bid will be accepted. Of course, I give you the consideration of retreat. We've been digging at this mountain for generations. It's our family business. If I we forfiet without reason, it impairs our credit. I will place the bid, as if my life depends on it. How can you be such a bigmouth? You won't offer us your seat in the quarry business? Of course not! You don't know anything about quarrying, only money. You can't do the business Am I right? Absolutely right! Shut the hell up! Can I get in? Oh, boss! Good! Boss. Have a seat. No, you sit there. Kabashima. I think you're acting a bit too harsh recently. I've nothing to say to an old geezer. Keep your nose not. I owed the former Asanoya boss so much. I protect them with all my life and won't let anyone take advantage of them. Go back! Alright. I doubt an old man like you can do it very well. Be careful. Never give up, Kotaro. Work hard, everyone! We will win the bid, Boss. Careful, everyone! Boss, that is Hanada Hidejiro. Are you Hanada Hidejiro? Yes. Are you the boss of the Kabashima? Remember my face. Excuse me. Did you see the boss of the Hayashida? - Yes, there. Hidejiro. I've come back. - Welcome back. Come here. - How was your Family in Nagoya? Well, our future boss is sick. Oh, I am so sorry. Sit down. Hidejiro, Yakuza live only for saving the face of thier family. Revenge after revenge, it's endless. I think you can do something different to save face. Don't you think so? Yes. Boss... Can you hold this? Oh, you understand me. I'm glad to hold onto it. Glad to see you again. But why are you still in this rural town? I wanted to say thank you for before. My wound has healed. Oh, that's good! No, thanks. I was concerned if you got in any trouble then. No Really? Thank goodness. I'm leaving. - Already? So soon? What a man. Even though I'm third rate geisha... you shouldn't leave three minutes after seeing me. I didn't meant to offend you. No, I mean, we can't charge you. I see. Sorry. I wanted to make you stay, just for the hour. Yeah? Tell you the truth, I'm happy that you came to see me. Miss, you're not from this town, are you? No. How do you know? With you, I feel like I'm in the Yanagibashi or Yoshicho area of Tokyo. Don't say that name, Yoshicho... Is there a reason? Yes. May I tell you my story? I am married. I'd been wandering with my husband and ended up in this town. And I became a geisha again. Your husband must be a good man. Yes. He is a yakuza. That was 5 years ago. We were staying with the Kaminarimon Family in Asakusa. He followed Yakuza obligation and lost his left arm. He lost his arm because I wasn't there to tend to it. When I saw your injured hand... it made me think of his accident. What's wrong? You look strange. No, I'm being strange. Did I say something to offend you? If so, I am sorry. By the way, may I ask your name? Miss... Here. Please accept this. Why? - I'm leaving. Miss... If you are Yakuza's wife, accept it. It's a present from a Yakuza from Tokyo. Sister! Why are you running from me? What do you want? Shut up! Move away! I have guests to see. - Shut up! Oh, you! Shut up, stupid. Sister! Oh, you're here! It's been a while. Yeah. How are you doing? Fine, thank you. It's been a fortnight. How can we not see each other in such a small town. So why are you here? I've been losing at gambling. I need money. As a severance package? You're in a bad mood. What happened? I'm much more popular than you think. You have a lover? Yes. He's so good. Good heart, trustworthy and somehow seems lonely like you. He's a Yakuza too. Yakuza? Hey, you have money? Yes. He gave it to me. Look, a man's wallet. How much you want? That's a lot. He must be crazy. Treat him well. Don't you mind? No, I don't. What's wrong? You're a professional geisha. You'd never give your virtue for money, right? Jukichi... Hold me. Hold me. Tighter! Don't ever part from me. Hold me! Do you need me, Boss? Hidejiro. How is the work here? Well, it's hard work. I could hardly keep up with the others. Oh, no. Everyone is happy to have you. They consider you an underboss. I'm happy to have you too. By the way, the bidding is today. Is Kotaro alright? You know, Asanoya has been in business for 200 years. That Kabashima could never win the bid! Sit down. Let's have some tea. Hey, tea please. Kyoko. Thanks for your kind concern. I was hired by Asanoya. Glad to hear that. I don't whine any more. Starting in the spring... I'm going to be a live-in cook at the cafeteria. I'll work as much as my brother did. Big girl. Don't be a burden to the others. Oh, Kotaro! Boss. Our bid was accepted. Accepted! - Yes! Congratulation! Thank you so much! Asanoya was accepted, Hidejiro. Congratulation. - Thank you. I'm so happy! Hey everyone, Asanoya's bid was accepted! Accepted! I have no time for you. Go home. Miss, you don't know Tokichi the Weasel? Weasel? Well, Iwanami Tokichi. I'm quite known in the Kanto area. Really? - That's right. Manly Tokichi fell in love with you at the first sight on that rainy day. I don't believe in love at the first sight. I like to be in his sight for long time then taken deeply in his heart. Damn. You're so cold! Thanks. I like a cold man, too. How about me? I tell you, a cold man is that. He doesn't come to see a geisha when he hasn't enough money. Oh, really! A man like you is called bumpkin. Poor me. I'm not good enough for you? That's right. Don't go crazy for a geisha. You'll just be hurt. Excuse me. Were you waiting for Hidejiro? Hidejiro? Well, sorry to bother you. But I am Orui's lover. Stop lying! I'm kidding. I was walking in on her but I didn't know you are my rival. You owe me one. Did you call me, Miss? Yes, come in. Mr. Hidejiro... I heard your name somewhere before... It's not an unusual name. I have to apologize to you. Apologize? Yes. I spent all money you gave me. Don't mind that. But I have no reason to accept that money. I should have returned it. Miss... You're a really good person. No... I'm not good. Please forgive me. I want be a bad wife now. Although I ended up like this... I've remained chaste. But I don't know how long I can go on. I wouldn't regret it if it was with you... Redeem you? What should I do? Kurokatsu is going to buy me from the geisha house. I don't know what to do... I can't do anything... Brother! Shigeji, don't grope a geisha on the streets. Don't be a disgrace to the Hayashida Family. Listen, bro. - Idiot! Speak to your sister, not me. Go home. Go! It's been long time, Kazama. Is this yours? Yes. I spent all the money. I wouldn't want tell my wife what happened between us. Stay away from her. I wouldn't have accepted her kindness if I know she was your wife. She's a good person. Orui said same thing about you. She seems to be in love with you. Stop joking. Kazama... You have such a good wife. Don't make her cry. Make her cry? I want you to leave this town. You want me to leave her? Don't be silly. I want you to get away from me. You know I'm working under the Hayashida Family. And you under our enemies, the Kabashima. You take money from your wife working as Geisha and drink it away. After I heard that story, I don't want to see you any more. Glad to hear that. Don't worry about us. If my wife complains about me... it's because she loves me. I won't accept your money because I can't live without her. Sorry to make you hear my problems. Hurry up! We're gonna start! Hey! Are you guys alright!? Wait, you bastards! Wait, everyone! Don't fight them! We beat you! Do you know who am I? I protect the people here. My name is Hanada Hidejiro. Go back and ask you boss about me! We'll be back! Put the fire out! I'll leave this Family unless we fight back! Me too. We've been keeping to the non-violence policy. But they just keep attacking us. Never fighting back is not the Yakuza way. I can no longer bear this. Hey, will you fight together with us? Idiots! Boss... Hidejiro, why did you go fight them? He did it for us. - Shut up! I'm not talking to you. Hidejiro... I return your knife. Leave here with it. I am so sorry about it. I couldn't help myself as a Yakuza. Boss. I would want to stay with you for Ryuhei's sake. Please forgive me. Hidejiro... Boss... If I may ask... Please keep my knife. So, you understand me. Thank you. I would be glad to keep it again. Thank you. Dammit! You were all beaten by one man. Wimps! Boss, Hidejiro is bothering us more and more. Listen, man. We beat Asanoya at any cost. Beat them until they can't work any more. And why don't we finish off Hayashida too? Asanoya can't stand against if that old fart doesn't have his back. We will, eventually. Excuse me, sir. Let me take a order to rub out Hidejiro. Who are you? I, originally from Kanto, am... Hey, enough of your introduction. Okay, I'll skip it. Boss, the price on that man's head is getting high. I have to charge a bit more now. There's a chance I'll fail. You don't pay if I fail. Okay? Okay, go ahead. I'll pay you some in advance. Excellent. Thank you! MINEGIAHI RYUHEI Brother... Mr. Asano and Boss Hayashida are very busy with the business. You should be happy. Mr. Hidejiro always helps me. I'm doing good. Thanks for coming here to pray, Hidejiro. Look at all those mountains. Good quality stones are buried there. Asanoya won the deed to mine all of it. We'll be working hard in the coming spring. Omine, his proposal is too good to pass up. I want to work here, Mama. Silly girl. He says you'll be his wife, not mistress. Understand? Omine, if you'll be my wife, you'll have a wonderful life. Let's go home together! Not so fast. She needs time to get ready. Oh, I see. You're not being fair, Mama. Why? You should hear out what Omine thinks. Right? You're just a pimp-out Geisha! You mean my husband? He's better than you. Shut up, whore! That's how the underboss is. Makes me laugh. Omine, go on now. Take a walk, bumpkin. What? - How scary! You scared me. Scared. Enjoy the rest of the evening, hot shot! Don't cry. You don't like him, do you? No. No wonder. Omine, do you have lover? Tell me. Sister. Tell me who. Shigeji... Shigeji? I love Shigeji. I love him so much! No. My brother is still a kid. You silly girl... Hey, faster! Underboss is waiting. - Yes. Shigeji? Bastard! Shigeji, what did you do? - Omine! Come with me - Where? Let's go now! - Where are we going? Wait! Why? Where are we going? Don't worry! Let's go! My dear! Hey. Shigeji did it, dear. I know. What can I do? I hope they make their getaway. We can settle this with money. Shigeji is an idiot, such an idiot. We did the same thing when we were young. Please, go to help them. I think they went to Omine's uncle in the mountains. They know that place? Are you there? Come in. You know what happened, right? - I do. He's your brother-in-law. So he is. But don't ask me to interrupt his love affair. You must get them. I spent so much money for that girl. That's your personal matter. Don't involve the Family. What? But I'll get them if you pay me. I am expensive. Is it okay? Yes. My dear! Shigeji must give Omine up. You also said there's no way they could be together. Yes. Underboss, I'll bring Omine back to you. That's all I'll do. - Yes, please. You're really crazy for her. I'll go alone. Boss. Oh, thanks. Silly kid. What a mess he made. Can I go to look for him, Boss? No, I'll go. Let me go with you. - No, no. I'll go alone. Shigeji could run back here. The Kabashima could do anything. In that case, I want you to be here. These guys need your help. Okay, I'm off. - Please be careful. Here's food for you. Eat. Thank you. You found a good man, Omine. You're no longer a little girl, I see. Shelter us in this house for a while, uncle. Please. Of course. Lovers should stay together and be happy. No one comes to a remote place like this. Someone's here. Hi, Uncle. Shigeji... - Bro. Run. - What? Run. Hurry up. They're coming here. What are you doing up so late? Can you take her on your cart? Are you running away with your love? Well, get on. Come. You get on too. Okay? Okay, let's go. Did you lay an ambush there? - Yes. Asanoya's people will all be in a panic. Hey, is he here? - Yes. You need me? I was waiting for you. How did it go? Well, those kids had already left. I was too late. Sorry. Really, they left? Too bad for you. Bro. He is your wife's brother... but you're still obligated to us. I've been treating you just like my own people... And this is how you return the favor? I ask you to save face for me according to Yakuza rules. Yes. Kill Hidejiro. Forgive me, Omine. I failed to get you away. No matter. I'm glad if we die together. Omine, come with me. Move away! No! - You come to my house with me. Stop! - Shigeji! Shigeji! Take her away. Hey, wait. What? Don't be so cruel. You did your job and got paid. Just shut up. I give the money back. What? You're gonna fight me, will you? Cut this shit out! What do you want? I brought you this from Kazama. Tell him I read it. Certainly I will. CHALLENGE TO A DUEL Did you find him? I see. You didn't. Thank you. Where is Shigeji in this cold night? Kotaro, if Shigeji comes here, let me know right away. Yes, I will. Poor Shigeji. He should have come to me. I would have helped him by any means. He didn't want to get you and me in trouble. Silly kid. I'll go look for him. Who's there? Come out if you want to see me. You want to kill me? Perish the thought. I killed someone when I was young, but it became a nightmare. Run! Boss! Boss! No, Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss was attacked! Boss! Everyone. I'll tell you Boss' last words. Although we know the Kabashima did this... don't seek revenge on them. Hidejiro, he wants to talk to you. Boss. Hidejiro... Forgive me. I once preached you against the Yakuza way. But I am a Yakuza. This is how a Yakuza ends up. Don't waste your life on revenge for me. You have to rebuild... the Kuramae family. Understand? I saw Hidejiro received Jukichi's challenge to duel. Are you sure? - Yes. Where the hell are they going to fight? Please help. I can't lose either of them. Help them! I know, I know. I'll look for that way. You go the other way. Nothing over there. Kazama. I have no reason to duel with you. Did you leave your wife? Your true love? Living the yakuza way, I have to give her up. You gave your soul to Kabashima. Tell you the truth, I left my dagger with Boss Hayashida. I have one for you. How is Boss Hayashida? Dead. Sorry to hear that. Stop it or I'll kill you, Kazama. Stop now. Don't make your wife cry more. Shut up! No, stop! Stop! Bastard! You dirty bastard! This bastard shot her, Kazama! Orui! Orui! She's gone. Now all is over between you and me. This is for condolence. Please take it. Under the sky, so far from home Fighting battles according to the Yakuza code I know this is foolish and I will be laughed at But can 't ignore when my people are crying Only the lion and peonies on my back can understand me Only the lion and peonies on my back can understand me Hidejiro. Hidejiro. I'm going with you. To where? To where you're going. Kazama. You're obligated to the Kabashima Family. If you fight them, it's against the Yakuza code. I know. But I told you, I can't live without Orui. Laugh at me all you want, but I fight for Orui. Let me die as a man. Kazama. Let's go. My tattooed skin made my mother cry My life is just one fight to the next Living this life only makes my mother cry But I don 't know how to console my parents The lion and peonies on my back are crying I fully know there will no mercy giving to my life And I know there will no mercy shown to my death That's the way a Yakuza lives I have no regrets in my foolish life I hear the night wind laughing at me There's Kabashima! I'm against Kabashima today! Kazama! I'm content. Kazama! - Thank you. Hang in there! Hidejiro, I'll take care of the dogs. You get their master! Don't shoot him. I'll finish him. Yeah, go ahead! You did it!
