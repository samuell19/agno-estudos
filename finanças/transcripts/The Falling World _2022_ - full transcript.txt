I actually read your first book. -Really? -Yeah. -I loved it. -Oh, thank you. [Lark] Yeah, the story of this woman, she's put at fault by the institution, and she goes through this cathartic transformation. It's dark, but... inspiring. That's so nice to hear, it feels like a lifetime ago. Yeah, the idea of-- of a mother abandoning her child to pursue this questionable future. It resonated with me. Yeah? Yeah, my mother abandoned me. Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. No, I'm... She was just going through something at the time, and I couldn't see her for years. Yeah. Yeah, that's really intense. I, um... I don't know why these are such recurring themes for me. I would be really interested in your... perspective on all of this. It's just-- I mean, even in this new book... it's about this woman who abandons her three kids... and her husband, and she goes and lives with her eldest daughter in another town, and then when she gets there, she's accused of being a witch. Takes place in 1692, right at the start of the witch trials. I guess when you spend your formative years in a place like this... the Puritan thing kind of seeps into your subconscious. [Margot] What about you? You think you'll ever want kids? I don't know, I haven't really thought about it. Yeah, I guess I hadn't really thought about it, either. Well, it happened. It was just sort of the next step. And I love my kids. I really, really... really love them. But... it is not the life that I thought I had chosen. You know, they make it seem like you can have it all, but I'm not entirely sure that that's true. My oldest, Sophie. God, she's so smart. But, it's like she knew I was gonna be an unfit mother.

You seem like a Ripley kind of girl. Ripley? Oh, well, in the novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley, there's this guy, Tom Ripley, and he's travelling throughout Italy with this other guy and his girlfriend, and-- Anyway, throughout the course of the novel it becomes clear that he's, like, obsessed with the other guy. Like-- like, wants to be him, like some sort of sociopath, or... maybe a psychopath. Anyway, there's a scene where he tries on all his clothes and it just gets, like, really, really dark. What you were doing just now just reminded me of that. It's okay. I mean, who doesn't wanna be Hadley? She has fucking fabulous things. No, no, no, don't go. I was just making an observation. I had a history teacher in high school once that I wanted to be. She looked like Phoebe Cates, but with bigger tits, and she had the most fabulous fucking brain. I stole her pen once. It smelled like tuna fish. And then I realized, it's because she ate a tuna fish sandwich every single day for lunch. Tuna was never the same for me after that. I can't decide if it's, like, a fetish of mine, or if it's just-- just gross. Hey, can I ask you something? [Maeve] Yeah, sure, whatever. Margot said it was weird that people were back up here because something happened. What exactly happened? Oh, you mean about Jill? Who's Jill? Oh, I-- I thought Hadley told you. Um, Jill. Yeah, so, Jill was our friend. Uh... she's more like Hadley's friend. They were really close. She's actually Professor Bennett's sister, so she came to Quincy wanting to be like her hotshot big brother. I don't think he's hot. [Maeve] Anyway, so, yeah, during her first year she developed this eating disorder. It was so crazy. She said, like, aliens were telling her not to eat and stuff. I don't think I've heard of that happening to anyone. The alien thing? I know, right? So fucked up. But none of us could really do anything. So. [inhales audibly] Yeah, she... She disappeared. Actually, I think the last place she was seen was... here. But I think she's gone all, like, Grey Gardens and shit. She, like, got treatment and was, like, living with her rich old aunt on Rhode Island and a bunch of cats. [chuckles] So, you don't actually know what happened? No, I don't. But, that's my theory. And it's valid. Hey. It's for you. Hm. -[birds chirping] -[wind whooshing] -Nice robe. -It's a kimono. Went on a scavenger hunt in Hadley's room. Ooh, anything good? Hm... a collection of crime novels, some lingerie, Helmut Lang dress. A pair of sunglasses that are very Princess Grace, -but I've seen better. -Yeah, Grace Jones is way better. -And Grace Kelly? -[Baxter] Yeah. I was talking about the sunglasses. [Baxter] Oh. I also have some interesting information about the lark. [Baxter] Oh? She knows about Jill. How? Did Margot tell her? Yeah. I mean, she was going to find out sooner or later. What did you say? The eating disorder thing? Yeah, but I feel like that doesn't really hold up. Who came up with the alien part? Was it you or was it me? Neither one of us should take responsibility for that one. That was a full collaboration. You, me, and our friend, "K." [chuckling] Oh, my God. -[Maeve] Hello, friend. -Care to join us? Into the realm of the spectacular. That's a no. I feel high.

What'd you get? Well, it's not, like, a job. [group laughing] Yeah, I wanna know what inspired everyone -to become a lawyer. -[Maeve] Um, when I got into law school. I actually applied to medical, vet, and law school, but I only got into law school. I didn't know about the vet school. [Maeve] I thought I told you about my pet peacock. -I had snakes. -Of course you did. -[Baxter] That's hot. -No, it's not. Do you know there are 3000 species of snakes? -I did. -[Maeve] No, you didn't. -Yeah, I did. -[Maeve] No, you didn't. [Arthur] [indistinct] vet school. I didn't go to vet school. [chuckling] That's what I said. [indistinct chatter] I want-- I want Baxter to answer the question. [Maeve] What question? What inspired Baxter to become a lawyer? It was Jake. Jake inspired me. -Who's Jake? -[Baxter] He was my partner. He died five years ago. -Oh, I-- -[Baxter] Who's next? -[Maeve] I'm next. -[Baxter] Mm-mm. [Maeve] I am next. I'm gonna go. [board game wheel whirring] [crickets chirping] Hey, I'm so sorry-- Oh, please, honey. How could you know? It doesn't make me sad. I love who I am. I love what I do. And Jake's a part of that. I didn't always want to be a lawyer, you know. I wanted to be a painter. Really? [inhaling audibly] Every weekend in undergrad, I'd take the train into the city. This little Georgia peach never felt more at home 'til he made his way to The Big Apple. That's where I met Jake. He was a painter in the downtown scene. Did these incredible nudes. Like nothing I'd ever seen. Everything he did had this... pulse, you know? Now, for some reason... he decided to mentor me. And for the next ten years, everything was... everything. But then some of my friends started to get sick. You never think it's gonna happen to someone you love until... it does. [crickets chirping] -Do you still paint? -No. Lost the impulse. What about you, songbird? What brought you into the lion's den? I don't know. I think that there is a lot of things wrong with the world, and... if I can have any part in making it right... I think that would be nice. I know I'm wild. But I'm wild like a wildfire. And some things gotta burn. Now, let's get out of this cold. [chuckling] Do you want some? Oh. Oh, no, I'm fine.

Are there a lot of pets buried around here? [Arthur] Pets, and-- ah, I don't know. Hadley and Margot summer here, so, probably. I had snakes. It's more of a... toilet burial situation.

[crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [birds chirping] [stream trickling] [birds chirping] Wow. Yeah. I, uh... it kinda calms me down out here. Hard to hear myself think over the... All that stuff they were talking about, like, just stresses me out. Like, "Ooh, your career, and life," and then... Why? I did work really hard to get here, um... my family isn't like Hadley's, so, uh, I'm basically just, like, a poor little orphan boy.

At the end of first year, we all came up here. Bennett hosted a little retreat for some of his favorite students from his seminar. Basically us, Hadley and her friends. -[Maeve] And Jill. -Right. It's no wonder he's not a teacher anymore. He's basically, like, an administrator now. Wait, I thought he still taught class. Okay, like, one class for second year. Like, constitutional law or some bullshit elective. I really loved that class. Anyway, the retreat weekend, that was when Jill disappeared. -[Baxter] Maeve! -What? I mean, she already knows she exists. Or, existed. -She might still exist. -[Maeve] That's true. For the record, my memory of that night is super blurry. [Baxter] Mine too.
