Of course. Drink warmer. Okay. Ah.. Where is that? Hmm, okay. That, over there. Eh, map, map, map Finny? Did you take the map? And where's the flask? Oh, here it is. Never mind! Oh, do not forget this. Finny? Where is that boy? Dad, Dad! Something great happened, Dad! I actually make friends today! We boarded a cactus, and throw rocks into the canyon that was so deep, we couldn't even hear the land! It was great! Tomorrow we Are you even listening, Dad? I'm sorry, Finny. No, not again! You've just completed the new house! I just made friends! It's different this time. All animals of the world have been called to a gathering. Well, I'm staying here! No, listen. There is a flood coming, Finny. We'll drown if we don't leave. Water? Here? That's your lamest excuse ever! It's always the weather, or noisy neighbors, or birds pooping on a... porch. I know how you feel, Finny, but it's my job to keep you safe. Now. Where did I put that umbrella? Oh. Ready? Guess so. Come on. We got a long way to be going. We will find our place. Are we there yet? - Woah! - Woah! I think this is it. Looks like the flood will be here soon. Calm down, Finny. They wouldn't make us come all this way without some kind of a plan, right? Good spot. - Hey. - Quiet, please! Quiet! Behold! The king of the animals! Ah, look at this fella, Finny. Everything will be fine. I'm afraid I have some terrible news. Aah, I knew it! Dad, everything is staring. But it gives me great hope to see all you animals standing together as one. The fleshy doom carnivores And the vegetarian herbs. Together we will make our stand against the upcoming events. You may have noticed that the weather has been a little erratic lately. You may certainly have asked yourselves what might happen next. A flood! So great that it can cover the earth, engulfing and destroying everything in its path! - Oh, no! - There's are no survivors. Hey, mister, what's that boat-shaped thing behind ya? Oh, yes, yes. I was getting to that point. There wouldn't be any survivors if it wasn't for a very nice human called Noah. - Noah? - He's building a huge ark a ship to keep us animals safe until the flood has passed. I told you they had a plan. I probably should've started with that. Well, I, the king of the animals, has been appointed captain of the ark by Noah himself. He put me in charge of managing all animal affairs. So, Noah has some rules. First of all, there is a ban on carnivores eating herbivores. What? I should think so too. He seems pretty serious about that. Sadly. - Hey, let them go! - Uh, excuse me! Yes? Does that ban starts now, or when we board the ship? The ban starts now. See? I told you. And? And, finally, all animals are welcome on the ark. Hooray! As long as you are on Noah's list. - What did he say? - See you tomorrow at check-in. List? What list? Next. Good day! - Now, who do we have here? - We're songbirds, from Australia! Well, then you're on the list. Welcome aboard. Sign here, please! Thank you, you've checked in. Have a nice trip! - Next. - We are tigers from Siberia. Welcome aboard. - Next. - Oh, that's me! Coming, coming now. Left foot, middle foot, right foot, left... Ah, focus, Tanglefoot! Focus! come on! Hi, I'm a Tanglefoot! - Next. - Ah, here we go. - We are elephants. - From India or Africa? - Huh? Are you kidding? - Huh? You've already checked in. Next. Welcome aboard. Next. Welcome on the ark. Next. Next... next... next... Next. Hey. Hello, I'm Dave. I'm a Nestrian. Nestrian? It rings a bell. Where are you from? Ah, uh, actually, sir, we don't really know! We kinda travel the world looking for a place to stay. Wait a second. Aren't you the fellow that riffle blue gas - when you get scared? - Oh, you've heard of us? - I'm sure we're gonna have a great trip! - I'm sorry, next. What? No, this must be a mistake! If you're not on the list, you're not on the ark. Now, please. Don't send us away. We can be of great use to you. It's a long trip, right? We can make things nice and cozy for all of you. Nestrians are great home makers! I can even make a place like this look good. - Margaret lives here. - I think we've wasted enough time. No, you can't do this! You're not going to let some over sensitive, cave-dwelling, paper-pushing, crazy woman called "Margaret" tells us what to do! Right? We're all guys here, huh? - I'm Margaret. - Aah! Aah! Get out of here! Thankfully we're on the ark! Oh, hey, Dad! Hey. Leah? - Well? - Well what? We are Grymps. Of course we're on board. What are you doing? Oh, sorry, Mom. I forgot myself. You, young lady, have a lot to learn about being a Grymp. - Now, come on. - Yes, mom. So, Dad, how did it go? Never have gone better. Really? Excellent! - We're gonna be on the ark! - Uh, come on, son. Come on. Let's go. Did you see those cool-looking black cats? I think they're called Grymps, right? Maybe we will meet them again on board. Do you think all the animals of the world will be on there with us? Uh, well, it is a pretty big boat, you know. Hm, could you pass me the rope? Oh, sure. And will there be bears and elephants? Door, please? That's gonna be so awesome. Yeah, sure. Uh, dad? Uh, you know, this place turned out pretty well. Almost ashamed to leave, isn't it? - What are you talking... - I mean, we could stay here if you like - Maybe this time you can even make.. - Dad, we didn't get on the ark, did we? I'm sorry, Finny, we are not on the list. Ah, I knew they'd turn us away! Nestrians! - We just don't fit in. - Don't say that. I'll find us a home. A place where you'll make friends. Finny, look at me. I'll get us on the ark, okay? You mean it? I give you my word. Your attention, please. Do not forget to show your boarding passes and print it on your boots. Thank you. Okay, straight ahead. Enjoy your trip. Welcome aboard. Zebras Level 2, cabin 743. Have a nice trip! - Next! - Sure. Hey, do not cut the line. Sorry, guys, we are in a hurry. It's the Griffin. Check the list, if you can read. Help! Get me out! His breath is killing me! Get me out of here! Hey, spit him out! You know the rules! Can't you pull yourself together for once? I didn't come here all the way from Kansas to get eaten. Oh, you look so tasty. You guys scram before things get ugly. No offense, mate. But, uh You are a gorilla. Things are already ugly. You asked for it. You really think this is gonna work? We will get on the ark. You'll see. Please do not leave your luggage unattended or it may be eaten. Do you think we'll be the only Grymps on board? Why do you ask? I just thought it might be nice to have some company. Company? Grymps don't do company. The only way to survive was to look out for ourselves. Hey, nice highlights! Hey, nice highlights! Do you mind what you do with that thing? Grymps going through! Is that some sort of joke? Darling, there you are. What's the rush? You really think you're gonna get away with this? Not so loud. Pretty good, huh? - You think I look like that? - It was his idea! I'm going to tell the guards what you are trying to pull. - Good day to you, sir. - Don't touch me. - We are Grymps. - He's a liar! Oh, boy. Okay, straight ahead. Don't believe a word this thing is saying. Hey, go work out your family issues in your cabin. - He isn't my husband! - You are not the only ones who want aboard. - But I... - Another word, you're off. Next! This way, Mr. and Mrs. Grymp. See? I told you we'll get on the ark. Yeah! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain speaking. Please proceed to your cabins with the initial boarding process. Our sailing time will be approximately 40 days and 40 nights. We're expecting some choppy seas and light drizzles. Thank you. Hey, get out! This is our cabin! Who wants some? Check this out! Ocean view! May I also remind you that this is a non-carnivore voyage. Thank you for your understanding. I could really help some giraffes like right now Captain, you're still on air! Whoops! Thanks for playing along. You've saved our lives. Grymps don't save lives. We take them. I love you too. May I offer you your d-lux cabin. Including exclusive ocean view and king size Hayscock for your charming family. This isn't my husband. Throw him off this ark! Come on, darling. We'll make this place home in no time. If I may be so direct, you two make a rather endearing couple. - Where are you going? - None of your business. Cool! Count me in! Hey, I'm Finny. You know, I bet everyone thinks we are brother and sister. I'm not looking for a little sister. What? No! You'll be the little sister. And I'll be the... Hey. What are we doing here? I want to see the flood with my own eyes. You might've hurt somebody. "You might've hurt somebody." Run back to daddy if you're scared. For your own safety, please do not leave cabin during our voyage. Thank you for your cooperation. I knew there was no flood. I don't think we're allowed up here. Where's your sense of adventure? - Doesn't look like you have one. - I sure do. Hey! You kids ain't allowed up here! Phew, that was... Hmm, where did they go? Get your tail in. Ah, sorry. Aah! Hey, stop! Come back here! You kids are in big trouble! Maybe if we start crying, he'll feel bad and let us go. You can do whatever you like. I am a Grymp. We don't show fear. You don't scare me! Yeah, you better run! Wow, that was awesome. Did you see the look on his face? Yes! That's the look. The flood! What do we do? What do we do? Relax, we're on an ark. Right, this is the ark. What am I worried about? - This isn't the ark. - What? This isn't the ark! Leah, come inside. Hold on, Finny! Finny? Oh, no! The ark! Hey, stop! Stop! - Don't go without us! - Wait! Wait! Hey! Wait! Don't... stop... - Hey! - Hey! No! Don't leave without us. No! - You can swim, right? - I don't know, never been in the water! Time to find out! Aah... Huh? Look, they're bringing us back to the ark. Thanks for helping us! You're welcome. Hey, hey, you! What are you doing? This is the wrong way. They are definitely not helping us. We're helping ourselves for the flying snack. You're next! Oh no, don't tell me you've got Grymp-ed again. What the heck was that? How many times do I have to tell ya? Eat slowly. Oh, but I'm so hungry! Great, they are the only food left! Whatever you did, it works. Dad, Dad! Dad! Oh, no! They're leaving without us! What are we gonna do? The flood, it will be here soon! I don't know about you but I'm gonna keep moving. Children? What children? Leah! Finny? Oh! - Where's my daughter? - Ack! - Thanks, guys. - Don't worry. Leah? Finny? Uh-huh, uh-huh? No, she did not! Ugh, ask him if he knows where the kids are or not? Shh! No. - Finny? - Leah! Finny? - Finny? - Leah? - Finny! - Leah! Finny! Where are you? You probably don't know this. but running away is a Nestrian's specialy. Dad and I just can't seem to sit still. Although, that's all I want to do right now. I think we're high enough. We should make a shelter for the night. What's all this "we" stuff? I told you to get loss already. I'm a Grymp. We are loners. Are you sure? Nestrians are great company. and we build pretty good shelters. Forget it, we'll make our own shelters and go our seperate ways in the morning. Oh, please. Just a minute! In a bath! Hmm... Oh, hi! How nice of you to drop by. You're glowing. Oh, thanks. Oh, right. It happens in the dark. Comes in handy when you're... bad idea. Light attracts enemies. Can you switch it off? No, but do come inside. We're safe here, um...? Leah. I'm Finny. Did i mention Nestrians are great huggers? Somebody looks like she could use a hug. Don't even think about it. You like? What a waste of effort for just one night, huh. Nah, it's nothing. I can build a house anytime I want to. Nestrians don't stay in one place for long anyway. That's weird. Dad says we have to "find our place" or whatever. Which totally sucks when you want to make... You know, friends. I'll stay here tonight, but that's it. Tomorrow morning, I'm out of here. On my own. I guess the lion was right about the flood. Yeah. But we're safe here for the night. And our parents will definitely come and get us in the morning. I wonder if my mother even knows I'm disappeared. Of course she does. But my dad, he must be worried sick! I don't remember eating that. I've told that girl a million times not to leave my sight. I have a bad feeling about this. - What? - I have found your children. I knew it. Come on now, chop chop. Those aren't our kids! - Are you quite sure? - Of course we're sure! Those are hippos! Do we look like a hippos? Well, - Yes. - What? I didn't get on this ark to be insulted. Do you know what a Grymp is capapble of when he gets angry? Eh, I think I'm gonna be sick again. Go there, you stowaways! This is a mistake! What seems to be the problem? This better be important. I'm getting my make-up. Finally, somebody reasonable. Captain, you've got to turn the ship around. I'm in charge here, and I will not turn this ship around for anyone. But captain Lock up these stowaways. I'll deal with them later. What, no, I'm not a stowaway! He dragged me into this. And you and your lover can sort it out, hmm? No! Our kids are drowing out there. And we're locked up in here. This is all your fault. I'm as worried about the children as you are. But if you want to get out of here, we have to work together. You'd better think of a way out of here fast. Because I am getting hungry. What the...? Where is the forest? What are you doing? I'm building my own ark. Now I know what you're thinking. Where's bed, right? How about sleeping in a comfy hammock? That's pretty good. See, and you thought you'd be better off without me. Oops. Oh, crying isn't gonna help. I'm not crying. Well, you should be. Wait! if you're not crying, what's that noise? Those fly bats are back! We have to get away from here! There! Dry land! Hey, you take out the clumsy bloke. Easy prey, ain't it? Leah! I can't! 0h! Whoa! Right to the picking! - Aah! - Get off me! Oh, I hate Grymps! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Hi! - You ready? - No. Thanks, Leah, that was.. No more playing around! Yeah, time for breakfast. Ah .. chuu! I'm so sorry! It can't be helped when someone tickles my nostrils. Bless you! Thanks. Oh, oh, the water, it's here already! It's even worse than I thought. Who is that? A giant turties? Don't know, but it's helping them. Looks like we have to come up with .. Something else. Thanks for helping us. I'm Finny. And this is Leah. she's uh.. She's not much of a talker. My name is Obesey. Are you talking to yourself again? - Hmm? - Hi. Hi! Why aren't you kids on the ark? Are you rejects too? He's the reject. Not me. Our presence on the ark wasn't welcome either. Hey, steep yourself faster, that steep Flamingo just messed up my feather work I'm sorry about him. Stuck himself to me two years ago but won't get off. Name is Stayput. I'm Obesey's best friend. You are so annoying. We joke like this all the time. Now I have to share my last moments with a constant bridge that are in back sit driver. Hey, why don't you guys come with us? What? Oh, most kind of human, but I'm afraid we will just slow you down. Zip, old! Don't listen to him! We'd love to come with you! But where to, exactly? Hmm .. High up. Away from the flood. Good idea! Look at him. Hmm? How is he supposed to get up there? Come on, Leah, they've saved us. We can't just leave them here to drown. Fine, but they are your responsibility! Welcome to the team! Really? We can come with you. Great! See how it goes when I do the talking? Let's go! I don't believe this. That's how it'll go down like a ton of bricks. Do you hear that? What? Its dead silence. What do you expect? We're the only one left. Not the only ones. Relax. We're a team now. We're safe. Well, then we don't have anything to worry about, do we? Exactly! Head ups down there, you ratching hats. Let's keep it moving! It's really cool that you decide to come with us. We're all going the same way. What choice do I have? Come on, you gotta admit it. We make a great team. Stop calling us a team! Oh, you're so right. We totally need a team name. How about the Flood Runners? Or the Fearsome Four? Or Master of the Mountains? Shut up! Oh, no, I wouldn't do that If I were you. We're below the water line. Let's think for a minute. If we want to get out of here, we need a well thought out plan. Hmm. Oh, that's it! Okay! Okay, okay! So, we're here, in the bree. Where's the captain? Right! Up in the bridge. So we will ask the guards to let us out. Then we go through this corridor Up to the bridge. We reason with the captain. He will turn the ship around. and we'll all get the kids. No, there's no reasoning with the guard or the lion. - Oh. - I have a real plan. I'm gonna fight my way through the corridor. Take that. Then I take out the captain. Oh, wow, great plan. But did you forget that we're still locked up in here? Darn. How are we gonna get out? Ah, didn't you say you were hungry? Help! You come back here! Aah, somebody come in here! Not again. Huh? No hunting on the ark. What idiot put a herbivore and a carnivore in a same cell? I'm sorry, sir, that must be someone from the boarding ship pa... Hey! You can't... Wow, that was close! A little uh, a little too excited for my taste. Your plan worked. You make good bait. Oh, really? Hey, let me out! Which way? We don't have much time. I don't like being in here. Uh, let me think. I will be your best friend if you let me out. This way? Someone's coming! Aah! Oh, no. What the...? Oh, hey, guys, come on, let me out! Come on! Please, let me out! You can't do this. Thanks! What happened? The stowaways, they got out. What happened? The stowaways, they got out. They tricked me, and I didn't see it coming. She pretended she was hunting, so I went to stop her, and I said, "Hey, No hunting on the ark!" I knew they were trouble. Are you okay, sweetie? I'm okay. If I get my hands on those skanks, They're gonna pay for the... Eh .. Huh? - Let's get them! - Let's go get them, sweetie! I'm sorry, the gas... I'm going up to level 4. Sometimes, it happens when you get really, you know scared. How do you survive a single day? Now shut up and read the map. Up that ladder. And then it's uh... Wha! Children, please, wait! Turn left! Other left. Through that door on the next floor. Uh, upstairs, to the bridge! - You have reached your destination. - Ssh, quiet! I hope there's a doctor on board. Maybe I should try to talk to him again, it's... No more talking. I'll do this my way, the Grymp way. You just stay here. Don't do anything. Could you manage that? Or is that too much to ask of a Nestrian. Captain! Come in! Hi! How are you doing? I was wondering if I could have a word with you? You again? My, what a persistent little creature head. Your Highness, we... I have a big problem. Our kids are out there. Captain, you have to turn the ship around. I believe we discussed that issue. But sir, please. You are really starting to get on my last nerve. But my son he's all I have. I see, I'm not going to get rid of you that easily. I suppose I could make an exception to the troop between herbivores and carnivores. I didn't think anyone would miss a little... Nestrian. I told you, there's no talking to this guy. You know what? We make a great team. Let's find our children. That's where they've got to be. Candle-light dinner. Just the two of us. 0h yes, darling. We haven't done this in ages. Wow. That sure is a long way down. Maybe there's another way. Forget it! We can't afford to waste anymore time on detours. You've already spent half a day making that stupid hat for Obesey. But he needed some shade. I told you he would slow us down. My so mountaineers Might we stop for a quick rest? There is no time for rest, look! Well, I guess it's the bridge then. Okay, I'm going ahead. You need to go slowly, and one by one. Keep a good distance between each other. Some of these rocks are very loose. So wait for my word. And then .. And then what? You gotta be kidding me! Dinner's coming. Obesey, check it out! You're a giant bumblebee! Hey, where's Leah? Don't worry, she's fine. Right, Leah? Never been better. Up, up and away, Captain! Aye-aye! At this rate, we'll reach the top in no time. What are you doing? Get us down now. Wow! We will soon have reached our cruising altitude. Oh no! Oh, oh my goodness. I need to lie down. You are always lying down. - Leah? - I knew it! Are you okay? I knew this would happen! Look! Up there! It leads straight to the top! Okay! Even you can get up there, big guy. Yeah, we are the best team ever. - Let's go! - Yeah! I'm going on by myself. - What? - The whole team thing, it's not for me. But we've come so far. Far? I shouldn't even be here. I'm supposed to be on the ark with my mom. And it's your fault that I'm not. But Leah.. Where are you gonna go? It's safer to stay with us. I'm going on alone. I don't need advice from an over-grown slum. Wait, I think I know what will fix this. Someone needs a hug! I'm done. Goodbye. But I thought we were a team. What do we do now? If the offer for a hug is still on the table, I think I can do with one. Captain, we got a security-breach type situation. The guards! I'll take care of him. Wait a second. Come in, what are you waiting for? Sir! What seems to be the problem? Uh, a Nestrian and a Grymp escape from the brick, sir. What idiot would let a Nestrian escape? Well, sir. Go get them before you found them near off the gate. Don't just stand there. The entire animal kingdom is at stake. Yes, sir! Right away, sir! We're not gonna be able to keep this up for much longer. We've got to find Finny and Leah soon. We will. Uh, I mean, we will. Grymps are loners. Grymps are loners. Grymps don't show fear. Grymps don't show fear. Uh, why did I just listen to mom from the start? Grymps don't flock, herd or swarm. We do not make friends. Ah, Leah, get a grip! Mom! Finny! Hang on to my tongue! What? I said hang on to my tongue! Ah, you save me! Oh, that was nothing, don't mention it. Well, you know, I'm not going to ___ with that, but I'm part of the rescue team too. But, what I said, I forgive you, young lady. And actually, it was his idea. Heh? I just thought I'd get the team back together. Go team, Flood Runner! Uh, wait a second. I thought we went with "Masters of the Mountains"? Didn't we decide on team "Slow but steady"? I actually like the "Fearsome Four". Agree! Come on, guys! We're on a roll. It shouldn't take too long until we... Dog! Oh, boy! So Leah, still happy we've saved you? I mean, good to have you back. Don't mind me. I'm a babbler. Carry on. Hey, watch where they're going, dosy eyes. So dark. Anybody got a torque? Wow! This isn't so bad. Finny? Are you there? I'm here. Hey, check it out! Ta da! Why can't I do something like that? Because you are parasites, and not a grow worm. Follow me. I'll light the way. Oh yeah, I'm a parasite. And you turned out to be quite a good host. Just because I love onions doesn't mean I like the neighborhood. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Finny, Obesey needs a break. No problem. This looks like a good place to make camp for the night. Here? Come on guys, give me a hint. Trust me, he knows what he's doing. You Nestrians truly know how to make things cozy, don't ya? You bet. We should reach the peak in the morning. But the flood. It seems unstoppable. Maybe we're not destined to survive. Have you thought about that? All my life, people have been making fun of me, saying I was good for nothing. I never fitted in anybody. Now they don't even want me on the ark. I'm just... Fat? No! Doomed! Don't say that! We can't give up now. We'll have a rest, and then we'll head for the peak, and signal for the ark. Right, come on, big guy. Relax a little. We've got a long way to go. I've got a long way to go. You're just sitting up there. Come on! I'm getting seasick in my sleep here. Sorry. The ground, hard as a rock. Maybe that's because it is a rock. I told you he knows what he's doing. No doubt. Don't stop, Obesey. Keep on going. Okay. Good night, everyone. Night, Finny. You know, we're doing alright here. They can't be far. I wonder if they're still alive at all. I've always been so hard on her. Trying to prepare her for life. You know? Make her tough. And now, Hey. I'd promised my son that I'd get him on the ark. and I'm gonna keep my word. I just know Leah is with him. You, um You glow. I know. I know. Rain? Run! Water! We gotta get down here! Come on, this way! Come on, Obesey! Come on, you can do it! I can't. Go on without me. Hey, you're not the only one here! Oh, no! Help him! Help us! Huh? You want help? You got it! - Ah! - Thank you, guys! There, daylight! Come, Obesey, get it up! Get it up! - This is it! - Yeah, if Obesey would hurry up. Oh, boy. See, no hands! Whoa, whoa, whoa! There is another way out! Stop now, Obesey! You can stop! Obesey, stop! I can not stop! Hey! Wow, I think you've found your true calling, Obesey. You're not a smug, you're a plug. I, I suppose I am! 0h! Obesey, stop! - Come on, Obese! - Back it up! Don't touch me there! Not my nostrils, stop! Oh, what a rain! Oh, no! I'm starving. Tell me about it. So what now, we wait until food just drops out of the sky? - What the? - Right! A genius, darling! Luck on our home delivery, eh? Where's your big scum freak to help you now? Oh, there he is. - Obesey! - Stayput! - Remember us! - As heroes! No, they're.. - We have to.. - No, Finny! They're gone. Come on, Finny. Obesey and Stayput wouldn't want us to give up. We really have to go. This is it. How much time do you think we have? Not a lot. We're alive! Yeah! Yeah, but what now? Can you see the mountain anywhere? No. It's gone. We gotta do something, Finny! This can't be the end. Obesey was right! We're not destined to survive. I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Leah. Hey. It wasn't your fault that we fall off the ark. It was mine. I never would have survived this long if it wasn't for you, Finny. You're a real friend. Come on, give me a hug. I don't believe it. I told you I was a great hugger. Not that! The ark! We're saved! - Hey! - Over here! - Hello! - Hey! - Hey! - We're over here! There is nothing but water. - Hey! We're here! - I don't think they can see us. We gotta do something! - Scare me! - What? I said scared me! I think we're too late. Oh, my! - It's Finny! - Is Leah with him? Uh-oh! Ouch! - I said scare me, not bite me! - Next time, be more specific. It worked! She's alive! I told you we'd find them. Where am I? Oh! Look who's awake? You! - Hold the wheel. - Aye-Aye. What are they doing? Come on, move! Come on! Huh? Wait a second. I'm in charge here! Huh? Let on on three. Three. Is that all you've got? My hair! How very dare you looks like I've got to get my claws dirty, after all? You wanna play dirty? How's that for dirty? - Thank you. - Let's go! - Ark has brakes, right? - Stop! We're safe! Finny! Thanks! Let's get on the ark. What are you waiting for? Finny!
