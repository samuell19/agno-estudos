Yeah. - Ready? - Ready. Here you go Oh, thanks. What? Annie. Oh my God. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. Huh. Yeah, you've definitely done that. So what you're into diving now? Well, yeah, sort of. What's that? Oh, that, we wanted to talk to you about it. You know, coming here was Cath's dream. So we thought it'd be the perfect place to pay our tributes. We all thought it was a good idea, but if you don't think it's right then- No, no, I'm sure it's great. Uh, I'm kind of tired from the long trip. Where's my room? Yeah, I'll show you. Hmm. Here you go. Thanks. Can I have the wine after you? - Yeah. - Oof, look at you go. - Want some more. - Yes. Why don't we make a toast here? Top up? Oh, yeah, thank you. Hmm. What have you been up to? Not much. Um, just working, looking after mom. I made an apple pie the other day. What? You're cooking? That's great. So is it true? You were working in the Greek Islands on a dive boat? Yeah. Yeah, taking happy snaps of rich divers. But, um, yeah, it didn't really work out. Stopped diving, actually. Really? Yeah. Hey, come and help me cook the marshmallows 'cause I keep dropping them in the fire. Watch out for that. Clutz. Here. Three days of paddling. Three days? I thought you said it was two. It's two nights, but three days paddling. Two days wouldn't be worth coming for. Three days of paddling. Don't worry. We'll take it easy on you. Won't we, Jodie? Of course. You did say that there was gonna be a four-star resort. There is, absolute luxury, rising pool, cocktails. Everything a girl could want. That's the third night. The third night? Great. Here we go. - Look at that. - Oh. Oh my God. - Come on, slow pokes. Let's go. Okay, who wants what? Actually, Annie, thinking about it, maybe you should take one of the yellow ones. Easier to get in and out of. - Sure. - Lisa, you'll take the other yellow one. Okay. Okay. Let's get packing And remember to distribute the weight evenly. Is she always this alpha? Mostly. Okay. Let's go. How are you? You okay? Yeah. You look tired. You wanna take a break? No, I'm not really tired. I don't need a break. You know, Annie don't get me wrong, it's great to see you, it's just like this isn't really you. You might be surprised. Come on. I'll tow you. I'm fine. Thanks. Hmm. Yeah, this is the place. Yes. Hey, we're gonna go for a dive. Oh. It's so beautiful. - Mm. - Oh. Hey. Ready? Uh, I'm just gonna float up here. Come with us? Okay. Let's go over here for a bit. Nic, follow me down? I'll come down in a minute. Okay. - Oh, hey. - Hi. Can you help me get out? Well, yeah, of course. Okay. I think I've damaged my spearhead. Hey, you coming down? Oh, my sinuses are playing up. Think I'm coming down with something. Okay. See you soon? Mm. Yeah. Okay. There's kids swimming on that island. Wait, what's that? Lots of fish around. Must be a bait ball. Shit. - What? - I think I saw a shark. Was it big? I don't know. I, I just saw the tip of the fan. We should let them know, right? - Yeah. - Nic! Nic, there's a shark! Nic, there's a shark! Come on! Nic! Look out! There's a shark! Hi. Check this out. There's a shark! Nic, come back! I think I saw a shark! Come back! I can't see anything. - Okay. - Stay calm. Don't splash. I didn't see anything. You saw a shark? Annie did. How big? I don't know. I just saw the tip. It's probably a reefy. There's lots of 'em around. Yeah. They're mostly harmless. So many fish came through. I know. Look what I scored. Oh, wow. It's almost lunch time. The sooner we get to the island, sooner we eat. Nic, why don't you and I go ahead and start cooking up this fish? - You sure you're okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. I was just worried about you guys. Go cook lunch. I'm starving. Okay. - Okay? - All right, let's go. Feeling better? Yeah. Nice. You all good? Yeah. I'm fine. Is that the first time you've met the man in the gray suit? - What? - The man in the gray suit. That's what surfers call sharks. - Really? - Yeah. I've seen a few. They're pretty timid usually. It's the big ones you have to worry about. Lisa! Lisa. Lisa! Oh, Lisa! Lisa! Annie! Annie! Oh my God! Annie! Shark! Shark! Shark! Shit. What's going on? I'm going back. Come on. Let's go. Lisa.

No, I mean right now. There are kids swimming on that island. Oh my God. Jodie! Jodie! There are kids in the water. Oh my God. I'll go warn them. You stay with Annie. Annie, can you paddle? Yeah. Okay, come on. Let's go. Yeah! Oh my God. Oh My God. Oh my God. Oh my God. God. Oh my God. Shark! Shark! Shark! See ya. Shark! Shark! Mom, shark! Shark! Shark! Shark! Shark! Shark, shark! Winston, hurry up! Faster! Faster! Winston! Come on, come! Stay there, Demi! Demi, don't move, don't move! Good girl! Oh my God. Yeah. Good girl. Come on, come on, come on. Move, move faster, faster! Come on, here, gir Here. Oh God! Come on! I got ya! Oh, okay! My, my leg! You're okay. You're all right, baby. You're okay. Are you okay? Hey? Lisa's gone. She's gone. Come here. It's okay.

Give them to me. Okay, okay. We have to put pressure on it. Keep pressing, that's fine. Keep pressing. Keep pressing. Okay. You're okay. You're gonna be fine. Look at me. Okay, yeah. Look at me. Is there anyone else on this island? No. We came here fishing with our husbands two days ago. Okay. Where are they? They've gone. They've taken the boat. They'll be gone for days. Okay. You're okay, you're okay. Maybe we should elevate the leg. - Right. - Here are a few towels. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. You're all right. - And breathe in. - Okay. - It's all right. - Here you go. Here you go, you're okay. - You're gonna be fine. Do you have any phone reception, internet, any way of getting help? No. It's all dead. The, the next island there's reception and people. Okay. What about boats? There's, there's a runner boat. Okay. Can you show us? That? That's not safe. Look what it did to the kayaks. Hey, what are you doing? I'm just gonna have a look. Wait. I'll come with you. I know we have to help her. Okay? I know that. But this, this won't get us to the island. You saw what it did to the kayaks and the pontoon. Jodie? Yeah, it's not great. So there are no other boats? What if we make it more stable? If we tie one of the kayaks here and the other one here, we can make it stable. Yeah, maybe, but we're still not gonna be safe. What are you doing? I'm going to try it out. Let me help ya. Annie. I know we need to get to the island, but not like this Annie, this isn't safe. We need to get her help. I'm going to get the kayaks. No. Jodie. Annie, please just wait! Annie! - Is this good? - Yeah, it's good. Three, two, one. I can't get it out of my mind. Poor Lisa. Jodie, come here. Look, what happened to Lisa was... But we have to keep going. You made it. Yeah, once you get used to it, it handled okay. So we just need to finish trying it here and then we can go get help. So this is your plan? Yep. Yeah, it's that simple? I guess so. "Cause what could possibly go wrong? Look, if you don't wanna come, that's fine. It's not that. We need to slow down and we need to think this through. We don't have time to slow down. Yes, there is. We need to think this through. I have thought this through. No you haven't. Not properly. Would you just listen to me? This isn't you, you can't do this! Don't tell me what I can and can't do! You don't know me. And you know what? Your sister Cath, your best friend. You didn't know her either. We have to do something. Remember what to do? - Mm-hmm. - Hi. How are you all? Here. These are for you. Some protection if it comes back. - Thank you. - No, thank you. We pray and make it to the next island safely. I'm coming with you. You don't have to do that, Nic. Really. Yes, I do. Okay. Here. Let's go. Three, two, one, push. Looks like we're near the channel. Shit. - What? - We're leaking. Oh shit. - How bad is it? - I don't know. It's hard to tell but it's definitely coming in. Here, bucket. Where's it coming from? Can anyone see where it's coming from? Oh shit. Sorry. - Let me have a go. - No, it's all right. I've got it. - Sit down. Fuck. Come on. - Check the petrol. - Come on. It's not the petrol. Please, check. It's half full. Maybe we hit something. Check the prop. I don't think so. I would've felt it. Oh, shit. Here, let me have a go. What is it? Nic? I thought I heard something. Fuck! I knew we shouldn't have come out here in this thing. Well, we had to do something. Look I know, but not in this! I said you didn't have to come. I said that Jodie and I were gonna do it. Like that would have changed anything! This still would've happened, Annie! Okay. Well at least I tried something. At least I did something and I didn't run away like you. - Fuck you! - No, fuck you! All right, all right. Enough. All we can do is paddle. So let's paddle. What did you mean back at the beach? What did you mean when you said I didn't know who you and Cath were? Oh, nothing. It was nothing. Can you just tell me? Okay. Well, you didn't come to the funeral, and then the next day you are out of the country and you haven't come back. I was left holding it all together. The funeral, the police inquiry. Mom's depression. Mine. I'm not as weak as you think I am. Who said you were weak? And Cath, she wasn't weak either. You didn't know her and you don't know me. You left. I couldn't. I just couldn't. Hey, look. Paddle. Come on, paddle. Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie, slowly. That's it. Stay calm. Come on. Annie! Annie! Annie! Where is she? Where is she? There she is! Annie! Annie, come on! You're, you're okay. I've got you. I've got you. Okay. Okay. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. You're okay. Come on. I've got you. That's it, come on. Uh! You're all right. It's okay. Come on. I've got you. Let me see. Let me see. Come on. Here. Get this off. Get this off. Oh, my God. Just got the life jacket. Oh my God. It missed you. It missed you. - Oh! You're alive. You're alive. I'm sorry for everything, for not being there to help you, for not being at the funeral, just everything. I just, I couldn't, I couldn't, I just... I could have done something. I... I should have known. I could have done something. Save my sister, I should have done something. No one knew. That's the worst part. She never said anything. Oh, God. It's still here. What the fuck? Fuck off! Shit! - I can't see it anywhere. - Oh, fuck. There! Fuck. Oh my God. Oh my God. Why doesn't it leave us the fuck alone? Nic, what are we gonna do? We have to get to that island. We have to keep paddling. Nic? Nic? No. No? No more paddling. What, what do you mean? That thing is stalking us. Okay, I don't know why, if it's the paddling or what, but it's hunting us and it's not gonna stop. We head for that island, it'll come for us again. We have to get rid of it. - We need to kill it. - Are you crazy? It's a huge fucking shark. How are we going to do that? Do we still have that fish? Yeah, why? We trap it. We put the fish on the anchor, then we tie the anchor to the kayak. When it takes it, it'll get stuck to the kayak, and it'll drown. This is ridiculous. To beat it, we're gonna have to try something different. We're not gonna outrun it. We're just not. Annie? I'm in. Jodie? Come on. Help me untie this. Okay. Okay. Got it. Wonder if it's gone. I mean, if it's gone, we should be going for the island. Hasn't gone. How do you know that? Because it won't. Jodie's got a point. If it's not here, then we should be paddling for the island, right? I mean, we're losing time. Nic, if it comes, we'll take our positions. Exactly. We have to get going and get help for the... Oh my God. It hasn't gone. - Where is it? - I don't know. I don't know. Where did it go? Oh, fuck. Where the fuck is it? Undo the rope! Undo the rope! Jodie, undo the rope! - Hold on! - Jodie! Jodie! Oh fuck! Jodie, hurry up! - Jodie, untie it! Come on! Hurry up! Whoo! We did it! We got it! We got it. It worked. It worked. Oh, we actually got it. We did. Yeah. Wow. We should paddle. Yeah, we'll go faster if we all paddle. Let's get rid of this. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's go. Yeah, let's go. - We're almost there. - Yeah. - Jodie! - Jodie! Paddle, quick! Nic, it's coming! Jodie, go, go! Jodie, give me your hand! That's it. Oh! Pull! Come on! You're okay. We've got you. You okay? Can you stand? - Uh-huh. It's my shoulder, it's my shoulder! All right. Hold it close to your chest. Shit! All right. Ready? One, two... Oh shit. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm gonna put your arm in. I've got you. It's gonna be okay. All right. Hey. Okay. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Yeah? Oh my God. Shit. Nic, get down. Where'd it go? Where is it? Oh, it's there. It was there. Oh my God. Oh my God! It's coming! It's coming, Nic! It's coming! Shit. Shit. Okay, the trap didn't work, we- You okay? - Yeah. You? - Annie, you okay? - Yeah. Good. Oh shit. We're filling up. Where's the bucket? We're fucking sinking. How are we gonna get to the island? What are we gonna do? We're gonna trap it and drown it. - Yeah. - Okay? Kill it. Just kill it. Yeah. Okay Hey, help with this. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna trap it in the net. Here, tie it. Make sure it's tied tight. Grab the net. When I say throw, you throw. Hey, no matter what happens, we get to the island. Okay? - Okay, what about you? Don't worry about me. - Nic, what about you? - Just do it! Throw! Throw! Oh shit! Annie! Where's the machete? Oh shit! Annie. Annie. Annie, please! Annie! Annie, hey. Oh my God. Are you, are you okay? - Yeah. - It's okay. It's okay. I've got you. Here we go. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, it's Demi. - Hello, hi! - Hey, Demi! How are you? Good. Really good. Hey, Demi. How's your leg? See? That is gonna be a beauty of a scar. Huh, I know. I'm now known as shark girl. The girl that... - Oh. - Oh. Oh. To Cath and Lisa. You'll always be with us forever. Always in our hearts.
