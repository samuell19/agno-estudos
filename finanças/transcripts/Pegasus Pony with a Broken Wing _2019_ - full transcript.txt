Subtitles by explosiveskull [girl] The ancient Greeks told a tale of a winged white stallion named Pegasus. Mighty and majestic like no other on Elysium or Earth, Pegasus had two wondrous wings that made him lord of the skie. Wherever Pegasus would stride upon the earth, springs would appear, bringing with them flowers, plants and fruits that fed on the nourishing waters. One day, Zeus told Pegasus he would bestow upon him a great gift. Pegasus stood patiently, staring at the waters as the offering arrived. And so, Pegasus, lord of the skies, flew into the heavens to soar among the clouds and the stars with his daughter for all time. Pretty cool, huh? I guess. Only if you're into horses and stuff. It's way more than just horses and stuff. Anyway, I think it's pretty cool. [thunder rumbles] It's going to storm all summer. I just know it. Don't be silly, Jonathan. It's just a storm. No big deal. It'll be gone by the time you wake up. [Jonathan] Sydney? Yeah? I don't wanna move. I don't wanna leave the house or the ranch. I thought you didn't like horses. I don't, but I like it here. [sighs] Everything's gonna be all right, Jonathan. Okay? Good night. [switch clicks] - [thunder rumbling] - [insects chirping] [laughing] That's so funny! [thunder roars] [rain pattering] What is that? - [buzzing] - [bubbling] I don't need this. [grunts] [thunder rumbling] [man] I just can't. Please don't ask me again. - [woman] You have to let it go. - No, I can't. Not yet. We are doing our best. It is time to put what's best for our family... We are working 80-hour work weeks. Okay? We deserve better than all this debt. We could sell the ranch and start over. We could move on. Melanie, this ranch has been in my family for over 60 years. I can't just walk away from it. You may have lost all hope. I haven't. [sighs] [rain pattering] [thinking] God... - [sobs] - [thunder rumbles] Please help us through these hard times. Keep my family together. That's all I really want. For me and my little brother. [birds chirping] Hey, little man. Why the long face? - No reason. - No reason? Is there somewhere you'd like to go? Can you drive me to Simon's house? You bet. Hop in. Put your seat belt on. Oh, look. Someone moved into the old Johnson place. [horse snorts] Hey, buddy. [snorts, grunts] Can I give you a scratch? Come on. [grunts, snorts] Come on, J.R. - You need to eat, boy. - [snorts] The vet says there's nothing wrong with you. [grunts] [grunting] [hammering] [J.R. snorts] [sighs] [boy] That's a pretty horse you got there. Thanks. He's not feeling too hot, unfortunately. Sorry to hear that. - What's his name? - J.R. What's got him down? No one knows for sure. He's just depressed, I think. And don't tell me horses don't get depressed, 'cause I know they do. No, no, you're right. They have feelings, same as us. I'm, um... I'm Peter, by the way. We just moved into the house down the street. [chuckles] And you are? Oh, Sydney. Ah. Nice to meet you, Sydney. So, uh, how's school around here? Same as everything else. Dull. - Can't be all that bad. - Yeah? Well, you'll see. [chuckles] No wonder your horse is depressed. [Sydney chuckles] Anyways, I was driving my mom nuts, so she told me I ought to come down here and take a look around. You know, see if you guys had a summer job or something. I have always wanted to be a vet. I love animals, especially horses. My dad can't afford to hire anyone right now. Um, I can help out wherever I'm needed. I don't have to be paid. Or... [chuckles] - Maybe. [chuckles] - Okay. Would you look at that? - [Peter exclaims] - [J.R. huffs] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Sydney] Whoa. - [Peter chuckles] - [Sydney] Whoa, J.R. Whoa. [Peter] Whoa. Hey, hey. Something's making him nervous. Pretty. What kind of bird do you think it belongs to? I don't know. There's another one. Poor little thing, whatever it was. I don't know how little this thing was. Look at that. I don't think I've ever seen a feather that big or that white ever. - Whoa. - Did one of your horses get hurt? No way. Sounds like one got away. [exhales] Hold on. Hey. What do you make of this? You think a goose got knocked around in the storm? - That'd have to be one big goose. - Yeah. I guess you're right. [sighs] You look like you could use some lemonade. You always know how to cheer me up. Well, not much an ice cold glass of lemonade can't fix. Oh... [sighs] If only that were true. But I do feel better. Thank you. Oh. Look what I found. [man] Oh, my. I... I haven't seen these since I was a little kid. I found them when I was cleaning out the basement. Thought it might be nice to let them out for some air. - That's Grandpa William, right? - Mm-hmm. With Grandma Molly. [sniffs] Willy built the ranch, named it after her. Those two loved each other so much. - Molly's Ranch used to really be something, huh? - Mmm. The horses we raised were the most beautiful around. Breeders and riders came from all over. And the Hollywood folk loved it, too. I was just a little girl then, so I don't remember much, but... Oh, my mother used to tell the most exciting bedtime stories. Dad would be really ashamed of what I let happen to this place. No. Your father was very proud of you, Joshua. He's proud of you now. You're a wonderful teacher, a loving father. What happened around here is not your fault. And it's not gonna be the end of Molly's Ranch either. So, you just shoo those unpleasant thoughts right out of your head, young man. Okay. I'll try. Oh. [chuckles] Maybe this'll bring us some luck. - Whoa, whoa. - [whinnying] Whoa, J.R., whoa. Do you have any idea how many more clients you'd get if you had a website? Why would I need more clients? To make more money. I don't need more money. [chuckles] Uncle Nate, I could design you the most amazing website that you've ever seen. I have no doubt. I'll give you a good price. Look, Alan, if you need more money, why don't you wake up at 5:00, and come work for me. - I don't need more money. - Neither do I. - I'm just saying, it's... - No, that settles it. - Hi, Mr. Craft. - Hey, Jonathan. Lord, what I wouldn't give to be you this fine summer day. - Why's that? - Ain't this just about the greatest day ever created? The first day of summer vacation. I'm too old to care about summer anymore. Now, don't you go growing out of summer just yet. There's plenty of time for that later on. Keep the magic in your eyes, Jonathan. There's no such thing as magic, Mr. Craft. This is gonna be my masterpiece. Nothing you build ever works. What about that stupid rocket ship last summer? That... wasn't my fault. You almost burned your house down. That rocket ship would've worked if my stupid sister didn't get in the way. Nearly killed her cat. With great achievement comes great sacrifice. Someday they'll finally regret how they held me back. What about inventing something that will prevent my dad from selling the house? - Hmm. - [footsteps approaching] [gasps] Hey, Alyssa, I'm building a scooter this year. For real. We may even go into the city to buy comic books. We'll be cruising around all summer long, in style. Heck, I may even let you ride it. I'm gonna be the owner of NASA someday, and I'm gonna be the first person ever to put a comic book store on Mars. Mmm! You're a gross, little worm, Simon. I don't get girls. They don't have any foresight. What's foresight? I don't know. I hear Mom saying it all the time... to Dad. He doesn't have any of it. - Did he find a job yet? - Yeah. He's working at the construction site. But someday, he won't need a job. I'm gonna get this whole family rich. Yeah, sure. Just wait and see, buddy. Once it happens, the world won't know what hit it. Come on, boy. Good boy. - [Peter] Syd, is that one of yours? - [snorts] [Sydney] Most definitely not. Hey. Those aren't what I think they are... are they? [whinnying] [Peter] I think it's got a broken wing. Wait a minute. Are you more surprised that it's got a wing or that it's got a broken wing? 'Cause last time I checked, horses don't have wings. This one does. [Sydney] Where did it come from? [Peter] I don't know. [whinnying] [Sydney] This has gotta be some kind of joke. Someone's idea of a hoax or a prank or something. It's just gotta be. [Peter] Look, it's real. Those are real. What are you? Are you a Pegasus? - [whinnies] - [Peter] What's Pegasus? An ancient creature from Greek myth. I doubt it flew here all the way from Greece. It doesn't look all that ancient. So, what are we gonna do? I don't know, but... we can't leave her here for the grown-ups to find her. [Sydney] What do you mean? [Peter] They might sell her to a circus or... - something worse. - Worse? [Peter] Might take it to a lab and do experiments on it or something. There's a shed. We haven't used it in years. That sounds good, but can you get it to follow you? I don't know. Good girl. Or "it." Mr. Warren. Boy, it always makes my day brighter to hear my name called by a beautiful woman. I'm Melanie Killian. My husband and I own Molly's Ranch. Well, it's nice to finally meet you. I don't mind admitting you've cost me a lot of sleep. Yeah, sorry about that. Your offer on our property was very generous, um, Mr. Warren, but... - My husband and I... - I understand your concerns. I haven't told you my concerns yet, Mr. Warren. Call me Dan, and I know I dress like I belong in a Manhattan penthouse, but trust me, my roots are right here in the heartland. Yeah, I grew up working this soil. Sweating under the hot country sun. You know, I wear Armani, but my soul is 100% small town America, Mrs. Killian. And you call this small town America? Come here. Let me show you something. Please don't. You know, like it or not, small-town America isn't much of a business model. It's an outdated concept. If towns don't evolve, they get swallowed up by bigger fish. And what I've done here is just the beginning of my plans for your town. You know? I'm gonna give your town a fighting chance, is what I'm gonna do, and I promise, each and every one of you is gonna thank me. On the other side of those woods is your ranch. And that's where I'm gonna build restaurants and casinos and movie theaters. Can you imagine what an amusement park would do to that dusty strip over there? It would become a mecca for tourists. But there's one little thing holding me back. Our 100 acres. Which you are barely holding onto as it is. As far as I can tell. Mr. Warren. This is Pierian Pond. My husband grew up here. And my children played in this water. And it used to be as big as an ocean, and it's smaller now, but... This is our home. It's beautiful to us. Well, I'm sure it's beautiful to the mosquitoes, too. I came here today to tell you that we received your letters. We're considering your offer. Well, keep considering. But remember, the wheels of progress are moving fast, Mrs. Killian. Okay? With or without you. [groans] Gross. - [chuckling] - What are you laughing at? Nothing. Well, let's get it in there. - It's a she. - How do you know? - Are you really asking me that? - [chuckles] Yeah, okay. [laughs] - [Peter] Maybe we should cover her wings. - [Sydney clicks her tongue] He's just trying to help. [Peter] I don't think its leg is broken, so that's good. What about her... wing? I don't know. So what are you gonna do? I have some bandages and stuff at home. I might be able to make a splint or something. And then I also have some books on horse medicine, but... I think she's gonna be fine. I don't know, Peter. Maybe we should call someone. - No. No. - Or... This has got to be our secret, okay? You promise? Say it. Promise. [sighs] We're gonna cure this horse, take care of her, and get her back to wherever she came from. Wherever that is. Must be starving. I can do something about that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, J.R Let's wait. [giggles] There we go. He's excited to get back inside. [clicks tongue] - And you said this town was boring, right? - [chuckles] I, um... I'd better get going. Hmm. No worries. I got this. What are you waiting for? Go. [sighs] Mom. Hi, baby. Sure is beautiful here, isn't it? Even if you can't see it. You can see it though, right? Yeah. Are we gonna have to move? Your dad and I have a lot to consider, so... Sydney. You're still here, Simon? Time to go home already? I'm afraid so. Bye, Nate. Bye, Simon. [chuckles] Get real, Gus. [scoffs] You're talking crazy. Aliens aren't real. How do you know? I saw the pond. It was flashing green. You mean there's a spaceship hiding under there? Now I know where our son gets all those crazy ideas. - Hey. - I saw something, Emily. Did you tell anyone? No, not yet. [Emily] Good. Please don't. Okay? We need this job. [dog barks] Aliens? [dishes clattering] [utensils clattering] Hey. You okay? I'm busy. Did you have fun at Simon's? I bet you got a lot of plans for the summer. What kind of crazy contraption is he working on now? I don't care. I'm sick of Simon and his stupid ideas. Hey. I thought he was your best friend. Not for long. What is that supposed to mean? We're not moving. We're not selling the ranch. Yes, we are. Mom and Dad are just going to keep fighting all summer long and then we're gonna move. [Sydney] They won't let that happen. Yes, they will. Just leave me alone. [buzzing] [buzzing continues] [birds chirping] [horse whinnying] Hello? Sydney? Oh, my gosh! Jonathan! [sighs] What are you doing here? You scared me. I scared you? You scared me. What are you doing out here? N... Nothing unusual or strange. Why? I know you're hiding something. Nothing. I'm just cleaning up. Jonathan! A horse? What's the big deal? She's a pony, and it depends. Can you keep a secret? - Whatever. I'm heading back. - Jonathan. What? You can't tell anyone. It's just like in that lame old story your read to me. Not so lame now, huh? Where did you find him? - Her. - Her. In the woods. Just over the hill. Can I pet her? What happened to her wing? She's hurt. But we're gonna help her. "We"? [Peter] Hey. [Sydney] Jonathan, this is my friend, Peter. He just moved in next door. Peter, this is my brother, Jonathan. [whispers] Is he your boyfriend? He is a boy who is my friend. But we literally met yesterday, so slow your roll, dude. He's just helping us with Harmonia. Har who, now? [Sydney] Harmonia. Greek goddess of peace and harmony. I think it's rather fitting, don't you? Harmony for short. I like it. Whoa. Shh. - It's okay. - It's okay, girl. [groans] Hey, can you help me? - Sure. How? - Why don't you get some food so she'll be more calm? [Jonathan] Okay. [Peter] All right. Easy there, girl. We just wanna help. We just wanna make you feel better. Very good. Just like that. Good. [Peter chuckles] Your brother's a real natural. He doesn't even like horses. This is no horse. This is Harmony, daughter of Pegasus. [Sydney and Peter chuckle] What are you, a vet or something? [Peter] Uh, not yet, but I'm doing my best. Harmony's out cold, sleeping. Is she gonna be okay? I don't know. I hope so. Why don't we just ask for help? We can't. The grown-ups wouldn't understand. You do realize that she could solve all of our problems. What do you mean? Sydney didn't tell you? We're about to lose the farm. Jonathan, no. We have to save her. Look, um... Jonathan. If anyone found out... the military could come and take her away. She can't help us save the farm. And we have to help her fly home. Wherever that is. I, uh... I think I know somebody who could help with that. [snorts, whinnies] [gasps] Are they... Shh! [whinnying] [both snorting, grunting] Do you think they were talking back there? - I think so. - Yeah, why are you guys acting so surprised? Didn't you know animals can communicate? Not like that, I didn't. Anyway, where's she going? No idea. [Sydney] Ah, I'm so getting scared right now. J.R., where are you taking us? I don't get it. What's he trying to tell us? Yeah, why did he lead us here? What's so special about Pierian Pond? It's the pond from the story. The one with the magic water. What's he talking about? Guys? Legend says that Harmony was born out of a pond with mystical powers. It said whenever the water touched the soil, magical flowers would bloom. [Peter chuckles] I guess it's more than a legend. [horn blaring] What's that? [Sydney] It's the siren for the workers. We have to get to the flowers before they discover them. [indistinct chatter] [Peter] Let's come back later when no one can see us. - Can I come? - You better. You're one of us now. - Hey, Simon. - Dad. - What are you doing in here? - Building a scooter. You were always the smart one around here. Hey, Dad. Do you need something? [sighs] What do you know about space? I know that Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to our solar system, at a distance of 4.37 light-years away. And that... Good, good. That'll be fine. That'll be fine. Let me sh... Let me show you something. I took this last night. What do you think? It's a new phenomenon called glowing photosynthesis. It only happens a couple times a year. You mean... Underwater plants reflecting the sunlight they have accumulated through the day. Plants? Can I show you something? - Yeah. - Okay. Can you guess what this is? Blue fireflies in North Carolina. They only do that two or three times a year. How'd you get so smart? So, let me show you what I'm gonna do with the scooter. This is really, really powerful. It can climb a pretty steep incline. Is that legal at your age? Legal? Yeah, you know, I don't want anything to happen to you. - You know, just tell me. - Uh, yeah. Sure it is. Well, that's great, then. I'm very proud of you, Son. Thanks, Dad. Hey, Dad. Aren't you forgetting something? [Simon on tablet] Hey, check this out. How did you get this? My dad said he saw aliens last night or something. Do you know what it is? I have to go. Now. - Bye. - [Simon] Bye. Guys, look at this. - Where'd you get that? - Simon sent it to me. He said his father took the video last night. - Did you tell him? - Of course not. You do realize what this means. That legacy was right. It is a magic pond. - [chattering] - [engine starting] Mr. Warren. I think you need to come see this. [Warren] How many times do I have to tell you? Stay on schedule. Time is money. What is this? Destroy these. Boss, we don't own this yet. But we will own this! I don't want anything slowing us down, including pretty flowers. So, destroy these right now. All right, guys. Pull everything up. Don't leave anything behind. Go! Well, if it isn't Nathaniel Craft. Hello, Sandra. So, who's the lucky gal? These... are for you. Oh. [sniffs] Well, it's been a long time since a handsome man brought me flowers. Well, come on. Let's go inside and put them in some water. I'll bet you'd love some ice cold lemonade. That sounds just about perfect. Come on. [sighs] Hey, baby. How you doing, J.R.? Hmm? Let's go for a ride. Would you like that? Let's go for a ride. Come on. Come on. Good boy. Come on. You ready? [J.R. snorts, whinnies] Looking good. I'm so glad you came to visit. Can we do it again? I'd like that. - [J.R. whinnying] - I don't believe it. [Sandra laughs] And we thought that horse was just about to keel over. I told you. It's a magical day. Well, I guess you're right. [both laugh] [Jonathan] Look. [J.R. whinnies] [whinnies] Hi, guys. - Wanna go for a ride? - [Jonathan] Yeah. Come here. Up. Ho. - Ready? Wanna help? - [Jonathan] Yeah. - [Peter grunts] - [Sydney] There you go. - [Sydney] Jonathan. - [Peter] Hang on, buddy. You ready? You all set? Okay, let's go. [clicks tongue] Let's go. [J.R. whinnies] [both chuckle] Can you believe that ride? You're such a good boy. - [Melanie] He's the best boy. - [Sydney] Hey, bud. Hey, bud. [Josh] That was quite a surprise. J.R. looks like he's doing a lot better. It's incredible, isn't it? You... I have never seen you this happy. - Your mom is watching. - My mom is? Hey. Hi, Mom. Mr. Craft. I'm gonna kiss my wife. Just a little bit. - Love you. - I love you, too. [Sydney] Gross. - What? - [laughs] That's not... This is not gross. You want... You want gross? I'll show you gross. [blows raspberry] That's gross! [laughing] - [grunts] Did you get to ride, too? - Yeah. - He did. - Yeah? How'd you do? He did so well. [Warren] So, how much longer is that gonna take? - It's done. - And it'll record all night? - Twelve hours, continuous. - Perfect. - You don't have to... - No, no. Take it. It's for your silence. All right, I gotta make a phone call. Yep. Kids, dinner's ready! Oh. [phone rings] - [phone beeps] - Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Warren. Yes, um, this isn't a really good time right now. I... No, we haven't made a decision yet. We're about... We're about to have dinner. Mr. Warren, hi. I don't know if you heard my wife. She said it's not a good time. Good-bye. [laughs] [Melanie] Oh, I love it. What did you kids do today? - Nothing much. - Nothing? - Nothing? - Well, we hung out with Peter a bit. - Oh, yeah? - Oh. Seems like a nice enough kid. He's Sydney's new boyfriend. Shut up, Jonathan. What? He's not my boyfriend. And he is nice. He wants to become a veterinarian. Really? Well, maybe we have him to thank for J.R. [chuckles] Yeah, maybe. Maybe we should call an actual vet. - No. - No? I mean, J.R.'s fine. Everything's good. Um... We don't need to waste any more time or money. All right. Good enough for me. Let's not waste any more money. You know, I've got a good feeling. Yeah? What kind of feeling? Like things are finally going to turn around again and everything's gonna be all right. [sighs] Aw. Everything's gonna be fine. [bicycle wheels whirring] [sighs] You know what? [clicks tongue] Not tonight. [music starts] ♪ Love you like the first time ♪ ♪ I'll love you from now on ♪ Josh, I have to finish the dishes. ♪ I love you For the first time ♪ Josh. ♪ Oh, my love ♪ [laughing] ♪ Nobody ever took my heart ♪ - ♪ Nobody ever could... ♪ - I sure do love you.

What are you guys up to? Uh, oh, we're going to play outside. Go. [Peter grunts] I sure hope this works. - It has to. - I can't wait to see the magic. It's gonna be amazing. Harmony's gonna eat some magic flowers and get well again. You'll see. [Peter] Hey, look. Where'd these flowers come from? [grunts] We're good. [sighs] Oh, no. Look. [sighs] Let me try one more time. [grunts] Hey, can your bag hold water? We can try. The water may help Harmony feel better. [grunts] [Gus] Hey, you kids! What are you doing over there? We need to go now. [Sydney] I hope this water helps her wounds. [Sydney] Sadly, the flower was dead, and it didn't help Harmony. We've got to bring Harmony directly to the flowers. [yawns] I'm gonna go to sleep. Do you think she's going to die? We'll save her. I know we will. Can we keep her if we do? She doesn't belong to us. This isn't her home. I'm gonna miss her. We all will. But just think about how beautiful it will be when we reunite her with her father. You mean Pegasus? I sure hope so. You really think he exists? Well... [laughs] Until two days ago, I wasn't sure. But now, what do you think? [yawns] I want to believe! [laughs] Good. Go to sleep. [Sydney, echoing] The ancient Greeks told a tale of a winged white stallion named Pegasus. Pegasus had two wondrous wings that made him lord of the skie. Wherever Pegasus would tread upon the earth, springs would magically appear, bringing with them flowers, plants and fruit that fed on the nourishing waters. [Sydney] Jonathan, ask Simon to use his scooter to bring Harmony to the flowers. Can you finish the scooter by tonight? - Maybe. - I'm not asking much, Simon. - Come on. - I want to know why. I can't tell you. But I warn you, you won't believe me. Shoot. You know about Pegasus. - The Greek? - His daughter fell from the sky, breaking a wing, and the only way to heal is to eat the magic flowers from Pierian Pond. But the flowers die if we bring them to her. I need your scooter to take Harmony to the pond. Who is Harmony? The daughter of Pegasus. Do you really expect me to believe you? You finish the scooter and I'll prove it to you. Deal. Mr. Warren. What is going on? That's actually a question I have for you. I don't understand. Yeah, well, your kids and another kid trespassed on my property last night. - That's impossible. - Really? Well, here's footage of your daughter contaminating my pond. Sydney? Jonathan? We are very sorry that we trespassed on your property, and we promise never to do it again. Yeah, well, I'm afraid it's not that simple. What does that mean? They're just kids. Yeah, I know, I know, but I had to drain the pond and then refill it with uncontaminated water. You probably have no idea how expensive an operation like that is. What have you kids done? I think we know what the kids did. I mean, it's pretty clear. The question is, what are you willing to do? - What does that mean? - I mean, I could press charges, or... you could sign the contract and sell me this place, and I could forget this accident ever happened. - That's blackmail. - I'd be really careful about the terms you use, 'cause I got witnesses and a videotape. Kids. Is there something that we would like to say to Mr. Warren? - But we didn't do anything wrong. - You poisoned my pond. - No, we didn't. - We're sorry. Kids, can you go in the other room, please? Right now. Go. Mr. Warren, why don't you come back another time while my husband's home? Here's the contract. Sign it, and I'll be back to pick it up. See you later. [Gus] Hmm. Suppose I have to start looking for a new job. You didn't hear a thing? Really? I told you, I... I was watching TV. It gets lonely there. And where's Simon? I mean, these are his friends, after all. Just let me handle it. I'm sure you didn't mean to, Dad. That's okay. No, it's not okay. I didn't really like that job anyways. You know why they did it? You won't believe me. [scoffs] Try me. [Josh] Hey, honey. Uh-oh. What happened? Come on. [clicks tongue] Well, it doesn't sound good. No, Mom, it's not good. I'm sorry. Well, [sighs] what do you suggest? Well, we can either sell the property... or explain the situation to a judge. Warren has bought every single official in this town. No judge will help us. It's all my fault. I filled their heads with all those stories about Pierian Pond and... [doorbell rings] [sighs] Who now? [mutters] - Hi, Simon. - [Simon] Hi. - Hi. - Hello, I'm Gus, Simon's dad. Nice to meet you. Hi. Come on in. I'm sorry, Simon, but Jonathan is grounded. Oh, we're not here for a playdate. - Oh? - May we take a seat? Uh, of course. You may wanna sit down for this, too. [sighs] So Simon was telling me this incredible story, and I need to check it out. Do y'all know anything about Harmony? Um, who? Your little white pony. - [chuckles] We don't... - We don't have any ponies on this property. Well, that's not what Simon's saying. Dude, you were supposed to keep this a secret. You are supposed to be in your room, young man. I'll tell the story. [Sydney] Remember the storm three nights ago? Mom and Dad were fighting about the farm. I was so sad. I couldn't bear the idea of seeing this family torn apart. I didn't wanna leave this beautiful place. [thunder roars] That's when I heard it for the first time. [thunder rumbling] I looked up, but I didn't see it. The sky was dark. The next morning Peter and I went on a walk. That's when we found giant feathers like we've never seen before. J.R. got very nervous. I think he knew what they were. That's when we found Harmony. She was standing under a snag tree by Pierian Pond. And from that moment on, this has become a happier plac. Hang in there, girl. We're all friends. We're just trying to help. I can't believe it. It is true. It's all true. Can I... She doesn't really trust adults. Sydney, what... What's your plan? We have to take her to the pond. That's not gonna be easy. Simon and I have a plan. You can really help? I'll do whatever it takes to take down Daniel Warren. Dad got me an engine at the junkyard. That's right. Now you get to show them how smart you are. Jonathan, I need your help. - Aye aye, Captain. - Uh, Peter. All right, guys. Let's get this thing off of here. Get ready. Go. All right. - Jonathan. - [Gus] Tools. So, this is the brake and the clutch. To turn it on, you need to put that to start - and you need to put it into gear. - Yeah. But not yet. We still gotta fix the engine. Right. Yeah, buddy. - [Peter] Hey. - Peter, all right. I want you to tighten this bolt for me, okay? - [Sydney] Here's some lemonade. - Here you go, boys. This is good stuff. [exclaims] Don't mind a little finger there, do you? [laughs] All right, let's work on getting this thing started. Okay, Son, try it. No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on one second. - All right, come on. - [engine starts] All right. Let's go. Come on. [Gus] Okay. Here. I know what I can do to help. We got it. You mind helping me in the back? Right.

Okay, this is a good spot. Right here, right here, stop. Good job. Okay. Guys, so, unfortunately, I think that was the easy part. Why don't you kids go down to the pond and prep for the pony? And we need to make sure that this doesn't run away downhill. - Gus, you got this with me? - Yes, sir. - All right. - [Melanie] All right. - Real slow.

[Sydney sighs] - Come on, We gotta go. - [engine starts] Good luck, Mr. Warren. Path's clear. [Josh] Hi, you hear me? Josh? We're here. And it's time. I'll call him right away. [beeping] Nate? This is it. Are you ready? Uh, just arrived. We'll be there soon. Okay. Hey. Is it so hard for you to do your old uncle a favor? It's fine. It's whatever. So, you still working for that, uh, newspaper of yours? [scoffs] It's a blog. It's over two million followers. I don't see anyone. - It's online, Uncle Nate. - [scoffs] Come on. Let's go. [sighs] Okay. I got it. - [Josh] Let's go! - [Sydney] Faster! Hey, we need to go faster. Faster! We need to move! She's not gonna make it much longer, guys. All right. Let's open her up. Come on.

[Sydney] There you go. [Peter] Let me check her leg. [sniffles] She's healed. [wings flapping] [wings flapping] [whinnying] This can't be happening. But it is. - Do you wanna come with me? - Uh-huh. Let's go. - [Sydney] Right there. - [Peter] There you go. [Sydney] Eat the flower. It's amazing. - Right here. - What is it I'm seeing now? Just do your job and take the pictures. [shutter clicking] - [Peter] Chew more. - [Sydney] Right here, right here. [gasps] Oh... This is incredible. This is magic, is what it is. [wings flapping] - What? - [woman] Oh, my gosh. Look over there. - [exhales] - Oh... [Nate] Oh, my gosh. - Wow. Wow. - [laughing] Look. Pegasus. [woman] Oh, wow. Look at him. He's so gorgeous. This is something else. [woman] Oh, wow. Look at him. [Sydney] He's coming down to land. [Peter] This is unbelievable. [wings flapping] - [hooves clomping] - [whinnying] - [neighing] - Oh, my goodness. [sighs] [hums] [chuckles] [sighs] [whinnying] Hey! Hey, hey! This is private property. Get off my land, all of you. What are you hiding? What are you... Move over! Move! What's behind you? Oh. Horses with wings. Well, guess what? They're on my property, so now they're my horses with wings. And also, horses don't have wings. Okay? They're not real. - [Pegasus snorts] - Okay, they are real. But... Hey, you, stop filming right now. Too late. This is already a live feed. And over $50,000 in donations to save the ranch. To save the ranch? I own the ranch. I bought it from Killian. You better check those papers again, chief. [all laughing] The old disappearing ink... What are you, 12 years old, Josh? Okay. We'll see you in court. But I'm building my mall. I just want you to know, all of you guys. Yeah, about that? I don't really think so. See, in the past ten minutes, I just started an online petition to get this whole land turned into a national park. Oh, really? Well, that's not gonna work. So Mr. Warren, it's actually you who are trespassing. Officers, you might wanna take him away. All right, I'll leave. You know what? Developing land is too much trouble. All right, you guys are so... This place is a dump, anyway. [both laughing] Bye-bye, Mr. Warren! - [Gus] Bye! - [laughing] Ta-ta. [both laughing] Bye, Harmony. We're gonna miss you. [Jonathan] We're gonna miss you, girl. Have you ever been to Mars? Simon! What? I'm just curious. [Peter] They're flying away. Mom, you made it. You had me so worried. You really are the best father ever. You've got something in your eye, Nate Craft. You, too, Sandra Killian. [both laughing] [Sandra] That was just great. I loved it. You're a good kid, you know that? [chattering] It's all right, buddy. We'll get it running again tomorrow, okay? Hey, Simon, you built that? With a lot of help. Can you take me for a ride tomorrow? - Sure. I'd love that. - Thank you. I think your wish just came true. It did. That was awesome. - So cool. - Yeah. - Peter? - Yeah, what's up? Thank you. It was no problem, I... Uh... [giggles] Hey, um... Yeah. Anyways, that was really cool. See? I told you they were boyfriend and girlfriend. [snickering] So, what else are we gonna build this summer? A rocket. Another one? Really? Yep. A rocket to Mars. I have all the plans set up at my house. All right, let's do this.
