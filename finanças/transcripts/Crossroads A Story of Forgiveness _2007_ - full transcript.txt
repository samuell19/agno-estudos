New statistics on fatalitiescaused by street racing releasedby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationshow that these accidents usually took place on urbanroads and were nearly six times more likely to occur with maleteenagers at the wheel. There is now reason to believethat the recent fatal crash at Hillsborough Mall involvedstreet racing. Here's whatone witness had to say. Yeah, a kid was drivingfast in a black sports car. Uh, weaving in andout of traffic, you know, missing cars, like, by,you know, this much. Uh, then theother, kind of light brown car was going neckand neck with it, just as fast. I mean, these kids were hauling. When the black car hit, thatminivan didn't stand a chance. Authorities refuse to commenton the allegation that the 18-year-old driver wasstreet racing at the time. Did you know this? But among this age group,this mall at Hillsborough is a go-to destinationfor teen cruising. This is Wanda Rollins reporting. No. MAN:In other news,the mayor attended the groundbreaking ceremonyof the long-awaited... (overlapping chatter) Can I help you, sir?

What others?We're a couple units short for traffic controldown at the concert. Break away Osborneand, uh, McGuinness. Okay. Sir, it isourjobto investigate an accident thoroughly.But this kid whoplowed into them-- if he was racing and hecaused that accident, you will arrest him, right? Mr. Murakami, every witnessagreed your wife turned left out of a parking... My wife did not havea... a death wish! Our daughter was in that car! And another car hit them.But we cannot arrest that driver unless we prove hisactions were reckless.I was there! I saw what thosecars looked like! That kind of impactonly happens if someone is movingvery, very fast. Mr. Murakami, there must be hard evidence, or else it goes on recordas an accident. So then the kidwho killed them, he... what, he just walks away? Excuse me, sir. Commissioner, I needyour okay on this. At this point, wehave no such evidence. Therefore, we cannotfile charges.

All right, Tom, bye. Bye. There's a Mr. Murakami here. He's very insistent. Mr. Murakami. Ms. Teller,did you read it? Yes, I did.I can't take this... You telling meyou had no problems with that reportwhatsoever? Come back to my office. I'm being told thatmy wife is responsible for killing herselfand our daughter. Now, I knowthat's not true, and now you knowit's not true, right? The police filed thecase as an accident because they have conflictingeyewitness accounts. Push Mr. Johnson backfive minutes. Got it. Without sufficient evidence, it will be impossibleto convince the district attorney's officeto press charges against that driver. Is there any legal reason whythe case can't be reopened? Technically no, but my advice,you want someone in your camp the D.A. actually likes. I want the best person. I'm not that. That case that you won where those two kidswere accused of arson-- you won that casebecause you cared. That was five orsix years ago. Things change. So maybe I'm allwrong about you. Maybe our case doesn't fitinto your career path, not high-profileenough for you. I apologize, Ms. Teller. You're lookingat a desperate man who really needs your help. and has run out ofideas on how to get it. I'll do a preliminaryinvestigation. Whatever you need from me... What I need from you is to keepyour hopes in check. This is not going to be easy. I don't expect anythingto be easy ever again.

Five minutes too late. Are you sure you wantto meet these witnesses? I can do this alone. No, I can handle it. MAN:I don't understandwhat you're saying. Exactly whatare you asking me? Would you say that the car wastraveling at an unsafe speed? Well, if you mean fast,I'd say yeah, but... it's kind of normalthese days. The small black car? Well, like I told the cops, it wasn't traveling all thatmuch faster than the traffic. It didn't... Now, the womanin the minivan, she just flewin front of him. Probably wasn'tpaying attention. I see women whipping outof that lot every day, doing their makeup, talking on their cells. Cindy wasn'ttalking on her cell... Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Scully. You've been very helpful. So you were stoppedat a light... Yep, I wassitting in my car. Could you fill in some detail,just a little? Uh... it was a black car and there was a light brown car. I see them both'cause I was in the far lane. The drivers did this sort ofnod thing to each other. Wait, you saw that, a nod? Yeah. Definitely. And then? And then, whenthe light changed, and, uh... vroom, they were out of there. This brown carthat you describe, it was not involvedin the accident? No, no, no, that dudedropped out when the traffic got heavier. Wait, when you say"dropped out," did he stop after the accidentor keep going? Oh, he was out of there. But, you know,the weird thing is, he came back. He was parked right in that lot. Are you sure? Yeah, definitely. He was watchingfrom across the street. I was like, "Whoa,this dude's got to be some kind of, like, pyroor something," you know? Whatever. There's another brown onein back there. No, he said it was in the loton the other side of the street. (cell phone rings) Excuse me. Try the wide angle. Go ahead. I'll call him back. We don't mind, really. I should've gotten my prioritiesstraight a long time ago. What if I didn't answerthe phone on this day? We probably wouldn'teven be sitting here. Bruce, you have to stop lookingfor the what-ifs.

No, no, hey, hey. Wait. I mean... there's got to be somethingI can do. It's one guy's wordagainst the other. It's not enough to grabthe D.A.'s attention. But he admittedthey were racing. Yes, and the Gutierrez kidwill refute that. And we have to convincethe sheriff's department that they might havemissed something. What do we need then? Hard evidence. I'm sorry, Bruce. I'm very latefor a meeting. We'll pick this upagain later, okay? Okay. Thank you. (sighs) There's one. One what? And there's another oneright there. And there's another oneright here. Security camera looking overthe parking lot. And you think that... Maybe it recorded the street,the accident in the background. It's definitely possible. Yeah? We're all over this.Okay. There were fivesecurity cameras. Three of them show the streeton the day of the accident. Really?Yes, really. I had to enlarge them,so they're a little fuzzy. But you get a very clearidea of what happened. Please, justgive me one second. Anna... The surveillance video shows Mr.Gutierrez in second position. We've been able to calculatehe was going in excess of 80 miles per hour. And as any judge will see, they're obviously racing. Here's your copy. Let us know when youmake an arrest.

JUDGE:You have been hiredto represent Justin Gutierrezfor this arraignment? PETERSON:I have, Your Honor. And you are Justin Gutierrez? Brody! GUTIERREZ:Yes, Your Honor. JUDGE:Very well. The purpose of the proceedingthis morning is to advise you, Mr. Gutierrez,of your rights, advise you of the chargesagainst you, and to set conditions for bail. Mr. Gutierrez,you are charged with two countsof vehicular homicide. Each count carries with ita potential 15-year sentence. If convicted, you could faceup to 30 years in prison. Do you understand the chargesagainst you, Mr. Gutierrez? Yes. And how do you plead? Mr. Gutierrez, how do you plead? Not guilty. (gavel banging,attendees murmuring) We expected it. Dad, Mom, I don't knowwhat I'm saying. Justin, please, son,keep it together. I can't say that. Justin,we need to be focused. The issue is bailright now, okay? Okay, I'll getback to you.Thanks. I can't believe he getsto just stroll on out of here like nothing happened.The judge seta low bail, because he doesn'thim to go very far.And it's a first offense. He's never been in trouble.Yeah, yeah, we heard.Save it. They want to plea bargain?Is that what that was about?His lawyer wants to talk. He wants to changehis plea, right? Why would he change the plea? Pleads guilty in exchangefor a concurrent sentence. Meaning what? He'll serve both sentencessimultaneously. So what, he-he serves15 years, not 30?That's correct. Oh, not necessarily. With time off for good behavior Excuse me, Ms. Teller,I'll take over from here.Must be hard to wrapyour head around the idea we're sittingat the same table on this one. If this goes totrial, you will not be sitting at my table.Wha-What do you mean, if?Okay, we did not come this far to plea bargain thisor whatever it isthat you call it. Okay, we wantto see justice done. Then we proceedto trial.Great. (rock music playingover headphones) (gasps)Hey! Get off him! Help us! Stop it! WOMAN:Help us! Stop it! (soft, rhythmic clinking) That's not the wayto solve anything. We all get angry, butthere's a big difference between being angry anddoing something stupid. What were you thinking? The good news isthey're not pressing charges. And they could--you know that, right? He knows, Bruce. And what's the matterwith my lasagna? No, it's good.It's great. Thank you. No, I didn't thinkthat was the problem, either. I think the problem is you. All of you. You know, you might trytalking to each other. It's a concept. (sighs) Letting each other knowhow you feel. I mean, what would Cindy thinkif she could see... Sorry. PAUL:Right now, the important thingis Justin be found innocent. We can't do or say anythingthat might raise an eyebrow. And we have to makesure that he keeps histhoughts to himself. Whoa, Paul, that's our sonyou're talking about. He's told the truthhis whole life. That's how we raised him. It's not a lie to sayit was an accident. Justin will tell the truth,and the truth is he did not leave this housewith the intention of hurting anyone, let alone... Explaining everythingthat happened could very easilyput him in prison. Is that what you want? How about what I want? Does that count? Of course it does, honey. Your mother andI are afraid... Afraid? That's funny-- I mean,you guys thinkyou'reafraid. Which is why we haveto be very carefulabout what we say. The prosecution could use... Right now, Dad,I don't care about what the prosecution does...or says or any of it. That's not whatI'm afraid of. You want to knowwhat I'm afraid of? I'm afraid thatfor the rest of my life, I'm never gonna be ableto be happy again. Or do anything normal without rememberingwhat I did... and how stupid I was. When all the facts are in, the judge could see itvery differently. I don't carehow the judge sees it, Dad. I care howIsee it...and howIdeal with it. Baby... (overlapping chatter) All rise. The Honorable JudgeRoarke now presiding. BAILIFF:Case 407655,The State v. Justin Gutierrez. PEÑA:In the next few days, I'm going to ask you to bearwitness to a terrible tragedy. A fiery wreckat Hillsborough Mall destroyed the Murakami family. ♪ A mother and daughtersenselessly killed by a callous and uncaring young man. Gone as a resultof Mr. Gutierrez's intentionally reckless decisionto race. Do you swear to tellthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,so help you God?I do. PEÑA:When the defendant made hisdecision to race, he turned his vehicle into ahigh-powered weapon, killing... Your Honor, you've heardthis story before. ...in the collision, the impact propelledthe Murakamis' minivan into the southbound traffic, instantly killing12-year-old Chelsea. When the vehicle exploded,Cindy perished as well. Numerous surveillance videocameras captured criminal intent of Mr. Gutierrez's driving. I ask you to look over hereat Mr. Murakami and say... ♪ This family deserves justice. ♪ ...and make no mistake about it. ♪ ...he made his decisionto commit homicide! As Justin flew through trafficat 80 miles per hour, they never stood a chance. He sealed their fates. Justin Gutierrezwas caught on camera. ♪ (echoing):...caught on camera,caught on camera... senselessly, senselessly,senselessly killed... by an uncaring, uncaring,uncaring young man.... young man, young man,young man... (tires screeching) (gasps) (sighs) (panting) I just can't sit in thatcourtroom another minute without knowing who thisguy is, what he's made of. I want to sit across fromhim, look him in the eye, and hear what he hasto say for himself. No lawyers, no coaching--just the two of us. Is that too much to ask? (panting) (door opens) Please. Please. (crying) Mr. Gutierrez... the reason I askedfor this meeting isI want to hear... what you have tosay for yourself. Just you and me. (crying quietly, sniffling) You do have somethingto say for yourself? (continues crying, sniffling) (crying, stammering) I want... to say... I want to say I'm sorry. (continues crying) I'm so sorry,I'm so sorry. (sobbing) ♪ MAN:Justin Gutierrez is a good kidfrom a good family. Your Honor, I want to... remind you he's not a criminal. To Mr. Peña and to their, uh,distinguished counsel... It was an accident. The law is very clear. There is no intent. He made a mistake. (whispering) ROARKE:Mr. Peterson,I am denying your request. And we will continueas scheduled. (reporters shouting questions) I'll handle this--unless you want to. No, no,have at it. REPORTER:Ms. Teller, Ms. Teller, why the vehicular homicide,not manslaughter? Is this to set an example forother teenagers or to expedite your political agenda?Wow. From our experience,such big words don't fly on your station,do they? (chuckles)Do I believe that there's another motivationbehind the charges brought against Justin Gutierrez? Good question,Mr. Cochand,but the answer is no. Two innocent people are dead. (overlapping clamoring) TELLER:It was a great day incourt for Mr. Murakami. The DA did a fine job. WOMAN:What about the Brown deposition,Ms. Teller? TELLER:I'll call him from the car. Hey. Bruce? What's going on? I'm not sure. Listen, we got to juststay on track here, try not to let someone'stears sway you. You're going tosee a lot of that. Maybe it was a mistake. I thought...he'd be different. Weird.Like an animal or something. But he wasn't;he's just a kid. It's out of our hands.He's like... Brody or Josh... or Chelsea.The State'sprosecuting. Wheels are in motion. Bruce... you wanted justice, and now you're going to get it. HECTOR:So, how'sthe trial going, man? Me and the guys have beenwatching the news and you have nothingto worry about. That kid's going down.I'm pretty sure abut that. Yeah. Hey, uh, let's checkthese studs. Trusses look good. (phone rings) Do you havethe specs on this?Yep. Yeah? WOMAN:Bruce Murakami, please?Yeah, this is he. Is Brody your son?Yeah, Brody's our son, my son. Well, he's been in a fight. He what? (tires squealing) (engine revving) (girls shouting) Excuse me, sir,can I help you? That's my son. Brody? Hey. What happened? Listen, I didn'tstart it. It's not my fault, okay? This kid, he just jumped mefrom behind and I had to fight back. Mr. Murakami. Mrs. Warren. I thought it was important for you to knowand for Brody to know that we have professionalcounseling available. Well, my son assuresme that the otherboy started it. There are two sidesto everything. Just so you know,I'm on Brody's side. Mr. Murakami, no matterwho was at fault here, I believe that Brody hasan anger issue... Anger issue? Come on. His anger'skind of normal, given the circumstances,don't you think? I understand it's beenvery difficult for you. And while you'rehere lecturing me about how to deal with my son, you have kids out heredriving recklessly and behaving irresponsibly. How come there's no security?How can you allow that?! We do have security,Mr. Murakami, but they havetheir hands full. Well, somebody needs to talkto these kids, explain to themwhat can happen. Every spring, we havehighway patrol officers come in, give the talk,show the video... And let me guess:they don't listen. Much like you, Mr. Murakami,they hate being lectured, especially bylaw enforcement. What exactlyare you asking me? Simple.When he's convicted... If he's convicted. He'll serve 30 years. Right. So just keepan open mind, okay? Okay.Hear me out. Is it to lateto revisit the idea of a plea agreement? Why would we do that now? The last timeI mentioned plea agreement... I-I know, but if he admitshis guilt in public, if he talks about it,it could help a lot of people. Can we call the D.A.? PEÑA:Look, it's unprecedented. That's gettingto be routine in this case. Would they agreeto it? Don't know. Bruce, I have to sayI don't like it. Why not? Because we have workedso hard to build a strong case,and now we have one. I don't get it. Trust me. Ms. Teller wouldn't say thatif she didn't believe it, but I'll look into it. Thanks. As I remember,I was hired to represent Cindyand Chelsea. Theyare theinnocent ones. I know, I knowand we've proved that. Yeah.This is whatI want to do. It's what I needto do. Look, Bruce,obviously it's your decision. But I... I think I've doneall I can do. I... So whetheryou choose to go on with thisor not, I... Bruce, I think my job's done. Thank you, Erin. I mean, you made all of it happen and I,I just want to... I... Good luck, really. Thank you. The videotapes are strong. They've been ableto determine the speed, our witnesses not holding upto the their witnesses. Wait a minute. What my wife askingis can you reduceit any further? No, I don't think so. It's very riskyto continue the trial consideringour position. This is a verygood agreement. My son's not a public... JUSTIN:Mom? Justin. Oh, we were just going overthings with the lawyer. This, this new proposal. Honey, if you change your pleato guilty... I serve a maximum of 15 years. 15 years. It's still a lifetime. It's my lifetime. Of course. I know. Sweetheart, the thing is,what if you're found innocent? I'm not innocent, Mom. Oh, but you are, Justin. You have no idea. It'll be okay, Mom. I promise. I'm want to do this. ♪ Could you find your seatsquickly and quietly, please? (overlapping chatter) Quietly? Thank you. (chatter dies down) I would like to introduceMr. Bruce Murakami. His son Brody is a junior here. As many of you already know, Brody's mother and sisterwere recently killed in a car accident. It was a tragic accidentthat should not have happened. I want you all to listenvery closely to what Mr. Murakami has to say. Mr. Murakami. Thank you. I want to thankPrincipal Warren for letting me be here. This was my idea, not hers. The fact is, I've never doneanything like this before. Okay... first of all, I want you to know thatfor weeks, after the accident, I've had an image in my mindof who was behind that wheel. I'm sure all of you do as well. But the truth of the matter ishe didn't fit that image at all. He could be you. (students murmuring) Or you. Or you. But it wasn't. It was you. Your name is Justin Gutierrez. Hello. Hello? When Mr. Murakami asked meto come here today, my first thought was, "Why?" Everybody knows the storyalready, right? It's been all over the news. I'm the kid that got upone morning, and I killed two peopleI'd never even met. I don't know why I decidedto race that day. I guess it was a "Look at me"kind of thing. Like, "I'm driving fast wheels.Watch what I can do." (sniffles)So when I got the "Let's race"signal at the light, I went for it. I mean, it was a rush,cutting in and out like snowboarding or skiing,but in a machine. Man, my tireswere off the ground. I remember, I was flying. And then it was suddenly...boom. It was all over. (voice breaking):I destroyed five people's lives. Seven, if you count my parents. And eight if you count me. (overlapping chatter) Killed by streetracing? Come on. That was so sad. (phone ringing) WOMAN:Hello? Hey, Melissa, yeah, uh,look, Brody might be a little bit upsetabout something... He's here.He is? Shoo Shooti Shooting Shooting p Shooting pool Shooting pool ou Shooting pool out Shooting pool out ba Shooting pool out back. Shooting pool out back.Thank Shooting pool out back.Thank yo Shooting pool out back.Thank you. Yeah, I'll come by and get him. All right, see you.Okay, bye. Guys, I'm reallysorry about this. Don't be. We're flatteredto be his backup family. Absolutely. He told usabout what you did today. Yeah, well, he didn'treact so well. BRUCE:I'm really sorryabout this. MELISSA:Well, you probably should haveexplained it to him. I thought hewouldn't show up, and I wantedhim to hear it. DAVID:Yeah, it must havebeen difficult, though, standing up therewith him. I... I can't imagine...At first it was... Hey, Brody. Well, it was an incrediblybrave thing to do, really. It wasn't brave-- it was lame. Thanks, guys. BRUCE:You thought it was lame? Whatever. I just thought thatthey would connectbetter with someone their own age,somebody younger... By the way,you didn't even tell me! Did you tell Josh? No. I'm sorry. Brody, I should have told you. It's too late for that. Why? Don't you get it, Dad? How could you go and be friendsor even do stuff with the guy who...?! How did this affect you? Did this affect you deeply? It sounds like you guyshave really learned something from just this presentation. So when you get home tonight, what are you going to be sayingto your parents? (overlapping chatter) Is this somethingyou're still going to do or has it changedyour viewpoint forever? These are just someof the many positive responses to Mr. Murakami's presentationhere at Lincoln High School. The windowshave been sealed here. I don't understand. Darrow? You meananotherhigh school? That's right,word got out about your talk, and now their principal wantsyou and the Gutierrez boy to do the same for his students. WARREN:They're listening, Bruce. (rock beat blasting) Brody, I know it might seemkind of strange to you. Yeah, got that right. I understand how you feel, but don't you thinkif doing it in another school in some way helps stop kidsfrom ruining lives, then it's worth it? You know what, Dad? I don't think you care what Ithink or feel about anything. I mean, You just want me to say,"Hey, it's a great idea, and everything's goingto be fine." But see... I don't think that. I won't ever think that. Anyway, I got to practice. That's okay. Bye. Bye. NANCY:What? What did he say? He wants me to come with himto another school. What's the pointof doing that again? You don't have to do that,Justin. I already said I would. That was not partof the plea agreement. Well, I want to do it, Dad. Justin, don't you...!Paul, I saw how the kidsreacted to him. Thank you, Mom. NANCY:You need a ride? He's picking me up. Kind of awkward, huh? (chuckles) Yeah. So, is this your highschool we're going to? No, sir. I went to Truman. Truman? I think we got aninvitation from them, too. How would you feel aboutgoing and speaking there? I imagine you've stillgot some friends. Not really. I dated a senior therefor a few months, but... Not anymore? We kind of drifted apart. So what, you don't doschool anymore, cool guy? Come here. How you doing? You know. JUSTIN:It's true what they saidabout me in court. My record's squeaky clean... ...and that's only becauseI was never caught before. (voice breaking):The truth is, I've raced before, lots of times... I even racedaround Hillsborough. And f-for the rest of my life... I have to livewith what I've done. I have to live...with the hurt... and painthat I've caused Mr. Murakami and... with what I've taken awayforever. And now... I will never, ever be ableto say anything that will make it better. So let me get this. They're out on some kind oflecture circuit together? That's... Wow. Yeah. Tell me about it. So what'd he say?I mean, how did he explain? He didn't. He didn't even botherto ask me. Just showed up with the guyto speak at my school. I mean, I was sittingright there, and I didn't even know about it. What did you do? What do you think? The old cut-and-run? Yeah, whatever. So, um... So what did the kids thinkabout what they said? I mean, how did they react? Who cares?! The point, is he made me feellike a complete idiot. And now they're goingto another one over at Darrow. And I heard a while agothey have another one next week. Brody...On what planet did he think that'd be okay?! Brody, hang on for a second,okay? I came all the way downhere to talk about this. I don't want to talkabout this.Well, just listen,then, okay? Maybe, this is Dad's way ofhandling the whole thing, okay? His way of dealing... No, don't, please, don't!Don't!! Don't tell me that this ishis way of dealing with it! This is my momand my sister! You don't turn theminto a slide show to teach the world a lesson. Brody, hang on a second. Brody, hold on. Brody, look, I think Dad isdoing this to honor them. Okay? To turnwhat happened... Into what,a bright and sunny day? Singsong around the campfire? Come on, man.What are we supposed to do, forgivethat loser kid,Brody. give him a big hug'cause he's writing Brody!"I'm sorry"on a blackboarda thousand times? Would you stop this?! How come nobodysees this but me?Brody, watch out! Stop! Brody! Brody?MAN: Is he all right? Brody. Mr. Hanson. BRUCE:Man, 12 stitches! I've never hadmore than two.(laughs) Too badabout your arm. Ah, it's just a fracture--no big deal. Yeah, yeah, no big dealthere, cool guy. So let me get this straight. This guy plows into youas you were just zipping along?Dad... Dad! It was my fault. Well, guess we got lucky, then. All of us. It's bizarre. It's the same thingthat happens every morning right when I wake up, but before I'm, you know,actually conscious. There's a few secondswhen the world seems good. Everything's okay,there's no problems. And then I blink and I remember... they're gone. And... right away I feel cold, you know, like I've sleptoutside all night, or... I don't know what. I hate how quiet it is. You know, I mean... I hate not seeing them when Iwalk through the door, you know? I hate how they're stuck instupid little picture frames, and we're left behind, trying to figure outwhy it happened. I just... I hate how I can'tget my old life back. BRUCE:Listen, guys, I'm... I'm sorry I've been... I mean, for a long time,even before this all happened, I've been doing my thing, on the phone,making deals... and not paying attentionto the one thing that really is important. That's you guys. I haven't been there for either one of you, especially thegenius of the family. Mm, thanks, Dad. I love you guys. And from now on, I'm not going to makeany decisions without talking it overwith you first. Okay? So, uh, that means you're thinking somethingright now, right? Yeah, Brody, I am. And I meanwhat I said. If you guysare okay with it, if you don't thinkit's the right thing to do, then that's the end of it. All right? Brody... your mom always called youthe genius of the family. I know how much she admired you... loved you. And I know how muchyou miss her. But I can see herstanding right here, and I can hear her voice. And she would tell youyour dad loves you, too. And I do, son. And I would never let anythingget between us ever again. I promise you. (sniffles) Mr. Murakami. Bruce. It's so good tosee you again. You too, Erin. I've beenfollowing it all. Yeah. Well, listen,I-I just really wanted to come here and thank youfor all that you did, I really appreciate it, and for taking the timefrom such a busy schedule I know that had to be very... The funny thing is,I'd forgotten how. to take the time to listen, to... feel, to thinkabout what justice really means, and I have youto thank for that. Really. How are the boys? We're getting there. Together. Good.Yeah, it's good. But? No. No buts. You never come here. Well, there is one tiny... That's what I thought. ...little thing. And? I want to take thisone step further. BAILIFF:...the Honorable JudgeRoarke now presiding. Please be seated. This court isnow in session. ROARKE:It seems to methis plea agreement is fairly straightforward. The defendant now pleads guilty to two countsof vehicular homicide, both counts to be servedconcurrently, for a total of 15 yearsat the state penitentiary. Is this your understanding of this agreement?Yes, Your Honor. And the State is alsoamenable to these terms? Uh, no, Your Honor, we're not. (spectators murmuring) Has something transpired sincethis agreement was reached? Your Honor, I spent the morningwith Mr. Murakami drafting a revisedplea agreement. May we approach? Now? You're makingthis request now, at the sentencing? Mr. Murakami, you're inagreement with this? Yes, Your Honor, I am, and I've spokenwith Mr. Gutierrez about the conditionsof the proposal. Very well. Carry on. As part of this new agreement,the state would like to request permissionfor Mr. Justin Gutierrez to address the court directly. ROARKE:Mr. Murakami. 13 weeks ago, Ihad the chance to sit and express to Mr. Murakami what I felt ever sincethis tragedy occurred. I expressed to himthe shame that I felt for my role in this accident. And now, I stand here today,publicly, and say to his sons, and to the rest of the world, that I'm so sorry. I believe Justin. I believe he's remorseful. I do not condone his actions,but I forgive him, and I think he'spaying the price. Sending Justin to prison would only make a tragicsituation worse. My wife and daughter's death would not seemso senseless, Your Honor, if Justin could continueto tell his story on the outside. If, if he could preventone kid, just one, from making the same fatal mistake he did, I feel my family wouldhave a... a chance to heal and justice would be served. PEÑA:Your Honor,may I approach? This agreement callsfor Mr. Gutierrez to team up withMr. Murakami to develop a program thatcombats reckless teen driving. And in exchange, we willagree to a lesser charge of manslaughterby culpable negligence. Now, in addition, Mr. Murakamihas asked that the word "felon" be removed from Justin's record. Mr. Murakami,do you fully understand that this would meanMr. Gutierrez would serveno prison time at all? Yes, Your Honor, I do. This is a remarkable proposal Mr. Murakami has putbefore this court. It's an enormous breakfor you, Mr. Gutierrez. It would mean that youwould not be a formally convicted felon. After consideringthis new information and previous submissions, I am now preparedto pass sentence. This reduced charge will carry a sentence of two yearsunder house arrest, eight years of probationand 300 hours of community service. Mr. Gutierrez, I hope you know what a great giftyou've been handed. Don't waste it. Court is adjourned. Thanks. I'll be right there. Hey. You did good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Murakami,we want to... (crying) Sorry. We can'tthank you enough for what you've donefor our son. For us. Yeah. Hey. Your father... What he did. You know... Yeah. I know. But... I know that you and yourbrother might not... We agree with him. It's the rightthing to do. And, uh... that time when I hit you... I'm sorry. Thank you. Nice job,Mr. Murakami.Thank you. Good luck, boys.JOSH:Thanks. Captioning sponsored byCBS and HALLMARK CARDS
