Piew, piew. Hey, what's that? Careful. It's a very special creature. A monster, a monster. No, Fly, you are not a scary monster. Sorry. Nella Della. Is your father home yet? - What do you think? - No? He's still teaching. - Hi Emilia. - Hi neighbour. - Hey. - Fly. - What's wrong? - Give me a hand, will you? - It's okay. - Set the table. - Where were you? - Uhm, buying the groceries. The whole afternoon? Don't you want to eat? - Dad said... - That you have to listen to me. Set the table. Where is dad? Blom. - Arthur. - It's a disaster. My publisher doesn't want to publish my work anymore. - My 147th book didn't sell well. - But the other 146 did? Not really... but a publisher has bestsellers too, doesn't he? How am I going to put food on the table? You're still writing, I see. Can I please have a look? Give it to me. Emmy, the most beautiful woman alive. How do I win your confidence? Where do I find the key to your heart? Why don't you take her out for coffee? - Me? - Yes, of course. Hello. What were you talking about with that obscure poet? Obscure poet? Arthur Hollidee is a friend of mine, Nella Della. And friends make time for each other. No, look. Forks on the left and knives on the right, Johannes. I suppose I'll be babysitting that toddler all day tomorrow? As long as you don't expect me to help him with his essay. So we're staying home all Christmas break, doing nothing. Nothing? I have enough work to do, Nella Della. Johannes, time to work on your essay, okay? You've been working for an hour and you haven't finished the introduction yet? I don't know what I should write. An introduction should keep the reader interested. So why Greek mythology? Because you told me to? Johannes. Because I like Greek mythology. Like? Just like? Come one Johannes, you have to believe in it. If you don't, who will? It's the same with my research on the ancient Greeks and Romans. As if anyone believes in that. Johannes? I'm not your slave. - What's wrong? - A leprechaun. In the cupboard. - That's impossible. - No really. You see? It was probably just a mouse. - Why don't you guys ever believe me? - Because you're fucking childish. - Really dad, I swear. I saw a little... - Imagination is totally wonderful - but leprechauns don't exist. - But mommy always said that at night, - when everyone's asleep, things happen. - Shut up. Maybe it was a mouse after all. Probably. Come on, let's go to bed. You go brush your teeth. Johannes? You know what I said. I asked you not to talk about mother. I just don't want dad to be sad. Okay? Fly. Fly? Calm down, I won't hurt you. I swear. I am Johannes. Johannes? What a funny name. What's your name? - I am Wiplala. - Wiplala? - And therefore not a leprechaun. - Alright, sorry. How did you end up here? I was crawling and crawling and crawling through a super long tunnel and then I saw a light and ended up here, but then when I snuck out tonight, I was attacked by that furry monster. Monster? But that's our cat, Fly. He won't hurt you. That's right. I betwinkled him. You what? Betwinkled. That's what Wiplalas do. Alright, so now you can un-betwinkle him. - What? - I want my cat back. Of course, easy. Did I mention that sometimes I can and sometimes I can't betwinkle? - No. - Sorry... - Are you comfortable? - Yes, very. Extremely. You're the best bed maker I know. - Good night. - Good night. - Dad, you have to go to school. - What? - Dad. - Yes. School. Oh shit, right. - Aren't you forgetting something? - What? Have a good day Nella Della. Eh yeah, have a good day Nella Della. Have a good one, dad. Wake up, loser. Eh, dad left for work, so I'll be leaving too, so eh... Leaving? I'm meeting Lies and Puk, they are going skiing. We stay home as usual, goody. Wiplala? What is this wonderfully gooey gunge? Ready? Ow, ow, ow. Stings. Stings. Genius. High five? Johannes. Where were you? In the city. All normal people are leaving on holiday tomorrow so... What's for dinner? Jeez dad. You were going to make dinner today. These are the best pizzas in the world. We all think so. My dad and sister and... Your mother... My mother thought so to. Try it, it's delicious. - Smells fine. - Smells fine? I'm not eating that. Gunge. Hi. Hi honey. - Here, you can do it. - Fly. Fly. - Did we lose Fly? - Yes, since yesterday. I haven't seen her either. - Come here, Fly. - Come. Fly. - Morning. Bye honey. - Bye dad. Bye neighbour. Fly. Fly. Fly. Fly, come on. Come here, Fly. Wiplala, wake up. Breakfast in bed for Christmas break. Christmas break? My dad's still working but Nella Della and I are home from school. Fly. - Fly, come on. - Fly. - Fly. - You were going to un-betwinkle Fly. Fly? Un-betwinkle. Did I tell you that sometimes I can and sometimes I can't... You can do it. Here you go. Practice on her. Un-betwinkle her back to life. - That's the problem. - You have to believe in yourself. Come on, un-betwinkle her. Just try it. Told you... Johannes, come here. If we don't hurry, there will be no Christmas trees left. Fly? Fly. - What did you do to him? - Nothing. Nothing? How is that possible? Are you mad? Hey. Uhm, I did that I'm afraid. Sorry. - A leprechaun. - No, the name is Wiplala. Wiplala can betwinkle. It's a kind of magic. Alright. - Use your magic to bring her back. - No, the right word is "betwinkle". And did I mention... Apparently he can only betwinkle and not un-betwinkle. That was a spider. Move it, loser. - Whoa, why is she always this... - What? Stupid? Where I come from we call it "high-strung". - Enjoy your tree, darling. - Thank you. - Why so small? - 20 euros doesn't buy much. - Shall I... - No, you're not betwinkling anything. Keep moving. Hi Nella Della, Johannes. - I'm losing my grip. - Come on, you're almost there. - A leprechaun. - I'm not a leprechaun. So they do exist. No, Wiplala. Oops. Un-betwinkle him. - Sometimes I can... - Un-betwinkle him. - And sometimes I can't. - Un-betwinkle him. - No, Nella Della, no. - Wiplala. Sorry. Come on Nella Della, let's decorate the tree. Where is dad? We're telling him everything when he gets home. No. Dad doesn't even believe in leprechauns. - I'm not a leprechaun, I'm a... - Wiplala. Yes we know. Wiplala is our secret. If you tell him, I have some other things to tell dad as well. - That you never take care of me. - Yes. Very true. Arthur. - Do you know anything about this, Blom? - No. It's a nice gesture, but right in front of our door? This is Arthur Hollidee, a famous poet. You know his work, right? Of course, who doesn't? It doesn't look like him. In real life he's much more powerful. I'm an admirer of Arthur's work, but perhaps this is one step too far. How did this thing end up here? Let me take a look. Arthur. At the moment I am unable to answer your call, but leave a message after the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Arthur, I'm looking at a very life-like statue of you, but why is it right outside my front door? Do you know anything about this? Arthur, call me back, will you? I have a surprise, from work. A Christmas packet? No, it's a lot more fun than that. - Are we there yet? - No. - Even further? - It's just a short walk, come on. - Tell me you locked up that leprechaun. - I'm not a leprechaun. - What did you say? - That it's not a leprechaun. Just our luck: A petrified poet and a petrified cat. That poet is pretty cool. But I want Fly back. Stay together guys. - There you go. A real restaurant. - Isn't this too fancy? I have a cheque. - Couldn't we just get some fast food? - Or get some sushi? - Wow. Is this the king's palace? - Ssht. And? - Have we decided yet? - Uhm... I would like some fries and meat rolls please. Excuse me? Me too. We do not serve fries and meat rolls. - And sushi? - No, of course not. - Might I suggest the surprise menu? - Oh sure. What is it exactly? Here you go, les hu?tres sp?ciales de claire num?ro un. Aah. Nice. Oysters. Enjoy. Come on kids, don't be so childish. - I'm trying, aren't I? - Alright. Delicious, isn't it? Johannes. That's it. What did I tell you? Mum. Dad. Meat rolls. I want that too. Excuse me. - Bringing food is prohibited. - I'm not sure how this... Sir, I must ask you to leave the establishment now. This must be a mistake, I really don't have... Let us out. Hello. We didn't do anything wrong. We're honest people. Please let us out. - Dad? - What? Hey. I can explain. Dad? This is Wiplala. Nice to meet you. Well yeah, so that's why I betwinkled the oysters. Unbelievable. Yes, I'm very good at food. - How can it be that a leprechaun... - He's not a... leprechaun. That this dwarf is ruining my reputation. - I can never show my face here again. - So? They don't even have fries. I will get a record and get fired - and I'll lose you guys. - Dad, stop exaggerating. And this is all your fault. - Dad. - Watch out. He can do magic. Hey. It's called "betwinkling". Guests who bring their own food... Betwinkling, magic, whatever it is... get us out of here. - Come on. - Here is... - Nobody. - The door was locked, right? - Yes, I locked it myself. - Where the hell are they? Well, it's impossible to arrest no one. No, wait. Perhaps they're hiding somewhere. Oh yes. There. Behind the sticky tape. Alright. Come here. Hey. Wait for me. Help me. Sorry. We made it out of there in one piece. Well done, Wiplala. I'll give you that much. - Alright, now un-betwinkle us. - No dad. Why not? I want to be big again, come on, un-betwinkle. - No. - What's the matter? Un-betwinkle, un-betwinkle, come on. - I could try. - Try? - He can only betwinkle one way. - Betwinkle one way? - Come on. - That statue of Hollidee... - Yes? - That's not a statue. That's... Arthur Hollidee. My friend. Watch out. Listen, Wiplala... I'm hungry, cold and would like to go home and preferably in a normal size. - Are there any more Wiplalas? - Yes. - And they can un-betwinkle people? - Yes. If they passed, that is. - Well then could they... - We'll go to the land of the Wiplalas where another Wiplala can un-betwinkle us. No, that's not possible. Everything is extremely tiny there. - But, we are too. - Yes. What if we just go and find another Wiplala? Wiplala. You got us into this mess, now you get us out of it. Tell me, where is that Wiplala land? Wiplala. At the end of an extremely long tunnel, which starts in... Our store cupboard. - Yes. That's it. - Come, let's go home, quick. Hey guys, slow down. - Come on dad, just a little bit further. - We're almost there. Right? I'm beat. Christ, seems like the smaller you are the colder it gets. Shrimp crackers. Biscuits. - Food. - Calm down, guys. Dad, we haven't eaten yet. Oysters aren't exactly filling. Guys, you cannot steal, that's wrong. Did you just say shrimp crackers? Wiplala. Why are you still awake? It's my fault that you guys are small too. I sort of like it. Really cool. Tomorrow we're going home, you crawl into that tunnel and get another Wiplala. Do you actually want to go home? Did you run away? It was the night of the big test. You have to show the board that you can betwinkle. - But sometimes I can... - And sometimes you can't. - Did I tell you already? - More than once... I really can't go back to Wiplala land. Honestly. Grandma, look: Crumbs. The mice are back. Mice, mice. Grandma has mice. Ming, stop it and go play. - Shall I betwinkle? - No, Wiplala. What did I tell you? No more betwinkling humans. It is indeed a statue of the poet Arthur Hollidee. And the statue is causing an impossible traffic situation. Nobody knows where it came from all of a sudden. Grandma, where are the batteries? - In the drawer. - No, they're not there. Could you tell me how it ended up here? Well, all of a sudden it was there, out of the blue. Like that. Of course, the poet himself often sat on that bench right over there. And where did Arthur Hollidee go? That's still a mystery. One thing is for sure, his statue is here. The anonymous artist is asked to come forward. The anonymous artist... Otherwise the city will be forced to remove the statue. No. I'm going home, Arthur needs us. No dad. No. What are you doing? Don't do it. Dad. Help. Help. Ming. Do not play with the car inside the store. - Johannes, what are you going... - Hold on. - Dad, dad. Are you okay? - Dad. Over there. Let's roll him. Push. Come on, dad. Don't take such stupid risks again. A tip: Little people need to be more careful than... Oh really? Thanks a lot. RAT POISON DO NOT TOUCH It's extremely dangerous here. We have to get out of here. Stop it. Take that car outside. Yo. Peekaboo, peekaboo. - Knock it off, Ming. - I almost got it, grandma. - My car, he's got my car. - Shut up, Ming. But a little man has my car. That's my hand. We'll get him, come and I'll give you something sweet. And now, Wiplala? We're going home, Wiplala. Well done. Thanks Nella Della, but this is your little brother's idea. Well done, little brother. - The smartest little human being I know. - Of course, he's my brother. Watch out. Shit. - Dad, let go. Dad. - That wannabe wizard can't drive. Dad. Let go. Wiplala, you're going the wrong way. Wiplala. Watch out. Let go. Well, we have to meet sooner or later. Bello, shut it. No, I'm talking to the dog. Go away. Bello. What are you doing? No, that car isn't yours. - There. - Help. Bello, listen, no. Come on, dad. My arm. That doesn't look good. We have to get him to a hospital. Alright. What is a hospital exactly? - It will be alright. - Hurry. - Babs? - Yes, doctor Vink. Make sure Lotje eats something today. We're starting to get worried. - That's the little girl from room 203. - Oh Lotje, right. - We have to go to room 203. - Room 203? Why? - There is a little girl in there. - She can help us. Grownups don't understand this. - Alright, follow that trolley. - Oh no... Yes mom. No mom. Yes mom. My lunch has arrived. Bye mom. This plate will be empty, okay? Orders from doctor Vink. Yes. We come in peace. Sssht. Wiplala. He won't hurt you. Honest. We want to ask you something. - Four dolls, four living dolls. - We're not dolls, we're normal people. Yes, or at least we were until a certain person... - He can do magic. - Betwinkle. And do you have to stay this small forever? I hope not. Ow, my arm. We're on our way home but we have to get his arm fixed first. Glad you asked me to come, Lotje. And I see that you finished your meal. Well done. I feel good, doctor. - What did you want to ask me? - Well, uhm... I need to tell you something, but you cannot do anything or tell anyone. That's what doctors are for. What's the matter? Is something wrong at home? - You promise? - Yes I promise. Hello doctor. My arm... - Hey wait. Please. - But you promised. - Doctor Vink? - Yes. - I would like a magnifying glass. - A magnifying glass? Yes and an appointment for an X-ray. And no ifs and buts. This is the smallest complex fracture I've ever seen. What now, doctor? Good evening. The authorities of Amsterdam are still in the dark as to the origins of the statue of Arthur Hollidee. The poet's disappearance... Alright guys. Eat well and then go to sleep. And tomorrow at first light... The sudden appearance of the immense statue has provoked a hype. While the sales of Hollidee's work skyrocket, the randomly placed statue has turned into a shrine for the poet. ...the keys to the locks of your heart. I identify completely with his work. - This is written about me. - While his true fans are inconsolable, the traffic chaos caused by this whole event worries the city council. This is Mr. Van Vliet, municipal official. Yes, that's right. Since the anonymous artist hasn't come forward, we will be forced to destroy the statue. And tomorrow this is the place where it's happening. Arthur, I read all 147 of your books and it's all clear to me now. Please come back. - Poor Emilia. - What? Poor Arthur, you mean. He's going to be destroyed while... What can we do? Dad. Let's go there. - Wiplala can... - Not that fake betwinkler. - He's already caused enough trouble. - But now... Not now Johannes, tomorrow morning we'll go there. - It's much too dangerous at night. - But then it'll too late. No, sorry. No, sorry. No, sorry. Are you also thinking about Arthur Hollidee? Yes. - We should help him before it's too late. - Alright. I'm going and you're coming with me. - And what about them? - Just you and me. You don't want to get another Wiplala so you have to un-betwinkle Arthur. But how? Do you feel like pizza? Hurry up. What if he's already there? I can't go any faster. Alright, hands against the wall and then keep walking. One, two, one, two, one, two... - Your order, beautiful. - Sorry? A margherita for the pretty lady behind the counter. - I didn't order anything. - Here's the receipt. - Can you read? - Can you read? - Is this some sort of joke? - What are these jokes? - You pay for the pizza, simple. - I'm not paying anything. I'm not leaving here until you pay. - I didn't order anything. - Yes you did. - No I didn't. - Yes you did. Just take that pizza back with you, okay? Did you order pizza? Lotje? This isn't funny, Lotje. Nella Della. Nella Della. They're gone. - Dad. Dad. - What? - Johannes is gone. - Johannes? - I think they ordered pizza. - What? I said no, it's dark and we're very small. Stay together, always stay together. Hey. Lotje. Hello? They say they didn't order anything. Yes, okay. Sir, sir, sir, Mister Pizza. So you did order a pizza? - Here you are... - Yes. - Shit. - Shit? Pizza margherita, you mean. Eleven euros. Johannes. Johannes? - This isn't what I ordered. - Just check the receipt. One pizza margherita. Johannes? Johannes? What are you doing? Quick, jump. I'll catch you. - Come on. - Wait, wait, wait, just a little bit. Please Johannes, the three of us have to stick together, no matter what. That's what I promised your mother. - Dad. - Stay here. I won't let go of you again. I was so scared... scared that I would lose you too. What are we doing? It's the middle of the night, Lotje. Lotje? That's not funny Lotje, go to bed. Dad. Everything's going wrong. Together we wanted... he can't do this alone. - Johannes, Johannes, calm down, calm. - It's all my fault. What were you planning exactly? We ordered a pizza. From the pizza place just around the corner. It's the fastest way home. That's clever. Wiplala and I wanted to go home as fast as possible. To save Arthur Hollidee. He's the only one that can do it. - Well, he's made a mess of it so far. - No he hasn't. He has, too. He can do it, but not if everyone keeps telling him he can't. True. Only saying what a person is doing wrong will hurt their confidence. That's exactly what you do to me. Nonsense. Is it? That's what you do dad. Johannes. We'll stick to the plan and go home. If we keep up the pace, you'll see Wiplala is waiting for us. He's a very clever little guy. - And if he's not home, then... - Then we'll look for him. But dad, we'll never make it... We'll never make it on time. Taxi? Cool. Unbelievable, Wiplala, that I'll make it home after all. Look. The monument on The Dam. Alright, go, go, go, Wiplala. No more stops. We'll fly home, dive into the cupboard, crawl to Wiplala land, get another Wiplala to un-betwinkle Arthur Hollidee... But, this is not where we live. Atlas. The palace on The Dam. What's wrong, Wiplala? - Is there such thing as Wiplala land? - No. Yes there is. In my land, there is nobody... I couldn't handle it anymore. I betwinkled wrong on the big test. Everyone made fun of me and I got angry... You turned them all to stone? You couldn't you un-betwinkle them? I'm staying here. - I'm not betwinkling ever again. - Hey. We can't stay small forever, Wiplala. Hey. Come back here. Fans of Hollidee, thanks to you Hollidee is more popular than ever. His books of poetry top the best seller lists in bookstores across the country. Arthur must stay. Arthur must stay. Arthur must stay. You petrify my friend and my cat. You shrink us and then you can't make us bigger. Now we're atop the highest building in Amsterdam... - Don't exaggerate. - I can't exaggerate? My dear friend Arthur Hollidee is about to be demolished. But our Wiplala is just fantastic. Dad, don't do it. Dad, stop. Scram. Get out of here. Stupid doves. Whoa, this celestial sphere is so damn heavy. - Hey, humans. - You're Atlas, right? Correct, my friend. I was wondering if you would be so kind to... Higher. A bit to the left... Oh yes, right there. That feels amazing. I've had an itch there for the last 200 years. You know what I think is funny? I see you walking around down there and I think "wow, they're so small". But now I see you up close and you guys are as tiny as ever. Normally we're much taller, you know. Well, that was funny. Anyway, this sphere here is so heavy. But someone has to do it. - How do you manage, I wonder? - Non cogitare, sed facere. Could you repeat that, sir? Non cogitare, sed facere. Don't think, but do. I'm not buying this crap. I'm not small and this statue is not alive. - I'm going home. Now. - No dad, stay here. Don't think, but do. Dad. - No, no please. - Dad, come on. Hold me. - Help. - Wiplala, help. Look. We're back to normal. I'm back. Wiplala, I knew you could do it. Wiplala? Don't think, but do. Look. The king. Should we wave? Not so fast, boys. Let me go. Arthur, come back. Wait. Stop. That's Arthur Hollidee, he's not a statue. Honest. Just believe him, it's Arthur Hollidee. Arthur? - A kiss can bring him back to life. - Only in fairy tales. You could try, couldn't you? - Arthur, I missed you so much. - Me? Yes you, Arthur Hollidee, the writer of all those beautiful poems. That's so nice of you to say. Great, isn't it? Did I tell you guys that... that... That you are the best children in the whole world. One, two, up you go. Good night, guys. I know how it goes now, betwinkling. If you can go back, you should go back. Thanks. - Without you I couldn't have... - Not true. - You have to believe in yourself. - You too. Bye, Nella Della girl. Bye, father. Bye, boy. - He wanted to go... - Home. Yes, of course, we all want that. He's home. Three, two, one... yes.
