No, because I'm gonna be late and I'm going to be fired before I even get through my first day of work. But I love you. I love you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Jessica's mom: Jess, please. Hello? (Door creaks and slams shut) Hello? Anybody in here? Cohen: (grunting) God! Goddamn son of a bitch! (Banging locker door) Fucking! Fucking cop! Shit! Hello? Cohen: How long have you been there? I just walked in. I'm Officer-- Turn around! - My order said to report-- - Cohen: I said, turn around. Stop! Cohen: I said, turn around, not walk away. Sir... I'm Sergeant Cohen. Officer Loren. - Loren? - Yes, sir. I... I was told to report here. It might have been a mistake. I thought the new station is up and running already. (Cohen chuckles) Oh, yes, it is. And she's a fucking beauty! Saint Michael himself would be impressed. And tomorrow when you see it you will fall down upon its steps and weep. But tonight you're here. Sir, um... I guess I don't understand what I am doing here. The real question is what the hell am I still doing here? But to answer yours, you are the lucky rookie to work the very last shift in this mausoleum. All 911 calls have been rerouted to the new station, so it should be quiet. Okay, you may have some walk-ups, but just send them up the street. The address and my number are on the wall. If there's an emergency, call the station. Here's the kitchen, and the waiting room down the hall if you get bored. That's holding, you don't have to go down there. Sarge, uh, - can I speak frankly? - Sure. Why am I here and not a security guard? - Cohen: Let's go, rookie! - Yes, sir. This room contains enough hazardous material to make Chernobyl look like fucking bird shit on a windowsill. Tonight, every hardened criminal in this area will do everything in their power to get to this. And you will be the only one standing between them and the total annihilation of this fucking city. (Cohen chuckles) I'm messing with you, rookie. Oh... I know. It's not in the department's policy to hire outside security when we have a whole fleet - of blue boys on the payroll. - Right. The only things left in these cabins are some needles, some bloodstained, shit-stained clothes. Basically all the vile crap that we collect from perps and crime scenes that have made their way through evidence and we can't throw in the trash. The material was supposed to be disposed of yesterday but for whatever reason it wasn't. So, Hazmat's gonna be here sometime between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Do not leave. I repeat, do not leave the premises. - Understood? - Yes, sir. I'll be back to relieve you when your shift is over. Any questions? No, sir.

I keep receiving 911 calls. Dispatcher: All calls have been rerouted. Yeah... I know, I called earlier to report the same issue. Dispatcher: Are you receiving a high volume of calls? No, it's not a high volume of calls. She's called twice. It's the same girl, her name is Monica. She's definitely in some kind of danger. I can't get much information. Dispatcher: Did you get her last name? Shit! No, I didn't. But she said that she is on a ranch or some kind of farm or something, there's pigs. Dispatcher: Okay, she's not dialing 911. So she has to be dialing your station directly. Okay. Well, can I trace her calls from here? Dispatcher: Yeah, I'm afraid I can't trace a call from that line but I can start looking into the pigs.

When they brought them in that night three of them, this wannabe Manson family. I think they were called the Paymons. Kidnapped and slaughtered those poor girls. Yes, they did. They also killed the Paymon family on the scene of the crime, the officers. I should know, my father was one of them. Heck, that's what they wanted you to believe. But they brought 'em in alive.

Well, they kept me up all night Singing this eerie song. (Humming) (humming continues) Then it just stopped. Those crazy bastards hung themselves with their own bed sheets.

No. I don't... If you ask me, I'm feeling pretty lucky. Well, to be honest, I don't completely mind the company. Rough night, I take it? Yeah, yeah. You could say that. That sounds terrible. What happened? Well, let's see. There is a crazy, homeless man in holding as we speak. He pissed all over my lobby. (Ryan laughs) It's not really funny. It's... it's kind of funny. Actually, it was pretty gross. Gross? I once had a perp shit all over the back seat of my squad car. Well... You win! Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Listen... honestly, when I found out you were working this shift, I snuck away to come and see you. I knew your father. Were you with him that night? Yeah. I was there when that Paymon fuck sh... - It's okay. - No, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. I wanna know. They never disclosed the details. He and I arrived early on the scene and... we were ordered to wail for backup. But we could hear these poor girls just begging for their lives. So we went in. And they opened fire. And I was able to pull out four girls while your dad held them off. They killed six more girls and two officers, including your father. He was a good cop. And he'd be so proud of you. Listen, I... I really have to go. You... you really don't have to go. I didn't mean what I said, I'm sorry if I was rude. - You can stay. - No, I... No... trust me, I'd love to but... If you need anything at all just give me a call, and I can pop right over and check on you. Do you remember my name? Officer Price. Right. I'll see you around. Officer Price?

I was just speaking to her. I, I was-- Dispatcher 1: Look, there were only three family members linked to the murders but there were over a dozen more living in the commune. Maybe you were right. There's a chance that the calls are coming from one of them. Playing a sick joke. Or... Or what? Dispatcher 1: This is just between the two of us, okay? Nobody likes to talk about it in the department, but it was more than just rusty pipes that got us out of that building. The Paymon family wasn't killed on the scene like the news said. They committed suicide in holding, and after that... well, things started happening. At first it was small, like the lights turning on and off. Missing evidence. Abnormal sightings.
