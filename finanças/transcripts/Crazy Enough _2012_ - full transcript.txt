Ow. Make a wish. Smells like lavender. Ugh. Hello, it's... It's Fred. What's going on, mulberry? Oh, hi. Mr. Philbrook. Hi. Oh, you called at a perfect time. Stop talking, Fred. Just... I don't have time to chat. Are you going to the Fitzpatrick today or not? Today? Oh, I... Yes, today. I need you to head out to the Fitzpatrick to sign some very important papers. Is there... Is my... You remember my lovely wife Lorna. She's got a big day today, and it's, uh... She's starting her own business, and it's her first day. She's got a big order. Fred, you're going to the Fitzpatrick. There are no other options. The papers will be at the front desk. Ahh! No! No. Morning! Good morning. Hey, buddy, how are you? Good. Hi. Hi, honey. Hi. What's up with the suit? Um... uh... I thought that it is a beautiful morning, and I thought, "why not put it on?" We're packing 20 cases of starvalicious bars. Jeans are fine. Rose, Freddie, finish up. Get your homework. We're leaving in five minutes. I'm not done eating, and I'm starving. I'm done... these eggs smell like chicken butt. Hey, that's mom's food. Kind of like you. Not today. Don't start. This is gonna be a big day for your mom. Big day. Honey, I have to go somewhere very quickly, like, for five minutes, and I'll be right back. Are you kidding me? No. You said you would help. Now... Now, please help. I know. I know. Philbrook called, like, literally a minute ago, and, uh, he wants me to just go by somewhere and sign something very quickly. Well, you know what? Just have Lisa run them by. I know, right? That would be great. I can't. It's the mental institution. The Fitzpatrick. What? Yeah, so... The crazy house, halfway across the state? Halfway, okay. Two hours, yeah. No, no. I'm coming right back. Two hours. Not okay. Honey, you know that philbrook is... He's, like, five... He's, like, inches away from becoming governor. You know that, and when that happens, this family's turning around. Like, we're going uptown. Could you buy me an ant farm? I'm... shh. Quiet. We're not buying you anything. You know me. Listen. Take the kids with you, drop them off at school, then come back and help. Okay, that's a great idea. Is there any way I could do that without the kid part? Okay, let's go. I call shotgun! You don't get shotgun. You're younger. Not if I get there first. Uh-uh, you're not gonna get there first, though! I don't know what you're saying when your mouth is full. I love you so much. This is Greene. Oh, hello, Mr. Philbrook. How's the campaign trail going? Cut the crap, Greene. Now, listen, Dr. Mulberry's on his way over as we speak. Just have the papers marked, waiting at the front desk. Uh, should I meet him and explain? The less he knows, the better. Why do you have a bag hanging in your car? Can I just take it down? Mm, sweetie, no. I'd rather you not, okay? And it's there for... Preparational reasons. If you're at a place in your life... Where you just want to... Oh, my gosh. What's going on? Oh, that's... You know, vol... let's... We can react without the volume. What is... Leave it alone. It's my science project. It's disgusting! What is it? So's your face. Okay, hey. Hey! No, we're not going there. All right? Don't make me be officer. Officer of what? Of... the sit... that... The situation that just happened. I don't know what you're talking about. Stupid. Hey, Colin, Rose is here. Shut up! Oh, my god, I hate you. You ruin my life. Hey, Dr. Mulberry. What? I'm starting to play football now. I don't think that's physically possible. Oh, my god, dad. You are so rude. You don't have to date the first person that talks to you. You deserve... You deserve better. Oh, and you deserve to sleep in the guest house. Oh, wait, you already do. My daughter... my daughter just said that to me! My daughter... Said that to me. My daughter just said that to me. That was so rude. My daughter. Enter. Well, it's Friday, so I need to start processing Dolores's release. She's not being released. Sir, I know how you feel about this. But Dolores turns 18 today, and her father can't store her here any longer. No release. There's a doctor on his way right now to sign some papers to keep her here. With all due respect... I appreciate the respect, but the feeling's not mutual right now. Dolores is a danger to herself and everybody else in this institution. She's staying put. But, sir, we can't keep her here. "We" aren't keeping her here. I'm keeping her here. Drop this folder on your way out, please. Nurse Nancy. It's... it's Teddy. I can't find him anywhere. I've looked in the rec room, in... in the cafeteria, in the gym. Well, here comes Dolores. I'm sure she knows. Hey. Well, would you look at that? Yeah. That is so pretty, Dolores. Teddy made it for me as a going-away present. But, um, are those my release papers? No, but Mr. Greene is handling that. Have you seen Teddy this morning? Um... sure haven't. But with family day and me leaving, he's probably a little frazzled. Should I go ask Mr. Greene for my papers? That won't be necessary. I'm sure he'll come to you when they're ready. Okay, well, um, I'm gonna Miss you, big John. Hey. And... I'm gonna Miss you too, Nancy. You're tough, but you've always been honest to me. Thanks, Dolores. It means a lot. Well, uh, see ya. Wouldn't wanna be ya. Hello. I need you to stop off and get some groceries, so write this down because I know you'll forget. Okay, yeah, well, I'll just write it down. I need... All right. 10 pounds of organic, fat-free vegetable spread... Okay... And 30 pounds of raw oats. Of course! Oh! Oh, yeah. I need 20 pounds of organic almonds. Okay. ♪ Here again someday ♪ the more I Miss you, the more I ♪ Ow! Oh, come on! Oh, my god. Well, thanks for all your help, Richard. I found Teddy. Perhaps next time, you can let me know when you let a patient walk up out of here and drive off on a tractor. To the Philbrooks, family means everything. I go to the same church, root for the same football team, and kiss the same woman each night before prayers. Thank you. Let's go, Teddy. My name is Phineas philbrook. Let's go. And I want to be the next governor of Oklahoma. Good, and I'm assuming he paid? Good. Oh, hang on just a second. Can I help you? Oh, god. I'm Dr. Mulberry. I'm here to sign some papers. Oh, um, yeah. Agh! Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, I'm here. Everything's fine. Okay, so tell me about it. Yeah, just a second. Yes, I want to hear all about it. Of course. So you're gonna go out with him again? Thanks. Oh. Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me. Do you think I could dry off with a towel or... Anything laying around or something? Um, that's not gonna work, is it? Probably not, I was just gonna say probably not. Um... Sorry, do you have, like, a bathroom or... I don't know. I'm just a temp. Shower or something? Um, you know, actually, right down there, there's a women's locker room. So maybe there's a men's too? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hang on a second. I have to buzz you in, so... You're so kind. Yeah, this place is kind of bizarre. Look, I know family days are hard for you, but you got a family, Teddy. Everybody here is a part of your family. I have to go to the bathroom. I know. We'll do it in a minute. I really have to go. Ohh, I have to go now. I know. Come on, we're coming. Stop that. Have you seen Dolores? 'Cause I need to tell her the news. No. I did. Excuse me? Nathan and I went on the online machine 'cause she's so happy to get out, and we went to go find her father. Look, her father is none of your business. And what are you doing on the online machine? Mr. Greene, all the patients... Look, I'm not even talking to you. Why are you looking for her father? I gotta go. I gotta go now. Okay, you can go in a minute. Let me tell you something, you nut case. You stay away from Dolores. You got me? Mr. Greene. I have to go to the bathroom so bad. There's a locker room right over there. Mm. You got two minutes. I have to go. You got two minutes. Ouch. Okay, Teddy, you got your two minutes. Your time is up! All right, Teddy, I'm comin' in! Teddy? Get out! I want you out this instant! Do you mind? Now! Out! What the... Who do you think you are? Now! Wait, you can't just walk in here. Where is my phone? Where are my clothes? I want you dressed immediately! These are not my clothes, and your tone is completely unacceptable. I demand to speak to your superior at once. I am the superior. Now get dressed! Oh, I am sorry, but your audacity needs to be leashed! I am already past the level of outrage! Orderlies, locker room, now! Do not talk to me like I'm some petite, adolescent sheep dog! I am a doctor! I demand to see my personal items at once. What do you need? Well, Teddy's decided to pull one over on us. Probably the stress. Take him back to his room. John, you stay outside his door until we get him settled down. Let's go, Teddy. No, I... no. No, no, no! No! No! Let go of me, you incompetent beasts! No, no! Calm down, Teddy. No! It's preposterous! Calm down. I am beside myself! It's for your own good. This is an outrage. No! Teddy... You are a fiend! You are a roach! Teddy, calm down! Stupid oaf. This is outrageous! No! No! You aren't even listening or paying attention, you... So, wait, if you met him at your brother's wedding, how do you know he's not, like, a cousin or something? You've got to be kidding me. So wait, is this... Is this the pilot, or is this the playwright? The bartender? Hmm. Dad there and your grandma and stuff? I don't know. Maybe, like, four. Yeah. We're supposed to see each other again on Tuesday, but I'm not sure. He doesn't make very good money. Deadbeat. Oh, my god. Uh, hang on. Excuse me. Yes? Find everything okay? Ye-yes. Thank you. I don't know. Beautiful day. Hmm. People here are weird. Yeah, probably not, though. What are you doing? Yeah, I can meet you there, then. No! Oww, my... Ow! My arm hair! My... are you even listening? Do you even know the level of embarrassment you're digging for yourself right now? Shut it! That's it. Now, you listen to me. I know that you're a doctor. But 20 minutes ago, you were the groundskeeper. And last week, you were a salesman. Now, we have supported all of your career adventures, but enough is enough. You will not treat us with disrespect! So I suggest you mind your manners, Teddy, or else this will be your last adventure. Take him to his room. God! How could you lie to me? Dolores, calm down. No! You're a liar! You lied to me the whole time! Go back to your room. I am not! What is this, a zoo? I'm sick of this place! You're a liar! No, no! Calm down. You stupid animal trainer! Oh! Ah, what the hell is this... I'm sorry, there's no listing for "what's the gel?" Would you like to try another destination? Home! Thank you. Proceed to turn left and head south on highway 131. Go, go, go, go! Aah! Aah! No! No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, open the door. Open the door this... What is this? What's that? You're not listening! Listen to my mouth! Can you hear? Can't you hear anything? Open this door! Ow! Ow! God. Agh! Oh! Agh! Hello, Teddy! Welcome back. Oh. Books. Uh, my name's not Ted. It's Fred. Uh... This is a nightmare. I knew a Fred once. Fred Henry, world war ii. Bad times. Bad times. Right. Poor boy, he fell in love with a nurse, but it could never work out. Oh, psh. You mean this Fred? Is this the Fred you're talking about? Oh, don't be a silly goose. That's a character in a book. Are you feeling all right, Teddy? You seem a little out of sorts. I'm not sure what's going on. But I'm not supposed to be here. You, um... You might wanna put on some clothes 'cause there's still quite a draft in here. Did I ever tell you about the time I entertained a small wager on my abilities to go around the world in 80 days? Well, let's just say it was quite an adventure. Together with my... My trusted valet Passepartout, oh, my gosh, we did... We did so many things neither one of us would ever have done if we had not accepted this challenge. And, uh, we rode on a hot air balloon... You're not gonna listen to me, are you? Which was amazing... You're just gonna keep talking, right? 'Cause neither one of us had ever done anything like that and, uh, and had no training. No... no real, formal training. And he was allergic to wicker in the basket, so, you know, that you ride in. They're all made out of wicker, and... and I don't like heights. I don't have many phobias, but I just don't like heights. Um, but, um... Oh, and we rode on an elephant, which was just so incredible. I don't know if you've ever done that. They're very big and lumbering. They lumber along, and you look kind of... And they feel like a crumb cake. If you've ever touched an elephant... If you've ever gotten really, you know, close and personal with an elephant, it, um, it can be quite an experience. And, uh, in... And your thighs start to strengthen after a while. Um, that's all I needed. That's all I needed to be satisfied. I needed to ride an elephant and, um, and... And have stronger thighs. Ah! Ah! Yes? Hey, have you left yet? Yes! Need you to stop off at the crest foods on elm. They have the best organic selection. You still have the list, right? Yes! Okay, well, great. Thank you. Please hurry home. Yes! Oh. I hope they have chocolate cake. I love chocolate. There was that time at the chocolate factory. Did I tell you about that one? Yes, you told me about the chocolate. Oh, well, okay. I'm very sorry, then. You don't have to be sorry. No, but it was interesting. It was so fascinating 'cause... It's all fascinating, isn't it? Books are really fascinating. It's so fascinating. Listen. It's been a great time. Really interesting. Happy reading. Teddy! Lunch is this way. Oh, no. What are you doing? George, go ahead and go to lunch. You know the way. Put him down! You need to settle down and act like every other patient. I am not one of your patients! My name is Dr. Frederick mulberry! I am a professional psychiatrist. If you want to sort this out, call my secretary. Call my wife! Okay, Teddy. What's the number? 405... Mm-hmm. 405-5... uh... Exactly. Now, just go to lunch! I don't know the number! I don't remember it! Teddy, I've had enough! Not everybody remembers their own number! Enough! Hey, Mr. Mulberry. Need some help? It's me, Colin. Rose's friend? I saw you when you dropped her off at school today. Colin! Right. Colin. Ah. Okay. Colin. Colin. Well, the effort doesn't make me go. I'm gonna go anyway, so... Yeah, I know. Come on. Where are we going anyway? Right over here. Going to lunch. I like this tile. What is it, Terra Cotta? No, uh-uh. You even know what that is? Yeah. I doubt it. I don't know how much of a pull you have here, but, um... When you guard... But, um, I was, uh... Thank you. I just... if you can get me out of here, I would... Really appreciate it. And it's... It's like, um, it's amazing Karma when you do good things for other people. Teddy, you already know the rules. What nurse Nancy says goes. Order something. Oh, my god. Every... is it yellow day? I'll have the... I'll have the... The corn. Well, is that corn? What is that? Corn... cream of corn or corn... corn... The... the acorn doesn't fall too far from the tree. Okay, I'll have some of the corn. That corn there. And some of it. Not a lot. And then, um, I'm just here for... temporarily. And, uh, all right, I'll have, like, a bean. But no more than that. I don't want that. And I would like... You know what? I'm just gonna have some of the corn. Definitely no cheese, and I'll have... That's exactly what I didn't want. Hey, Jason. Load it up. Oh, hey, hey. Hi. Can... can you get me out of here? What is this, Fawlty towers? What... Can I... Hello? Mr. Magoo? What is happening here? Yeah, buddy. Uh, all's well that ends well. All right, Jason. Uh, sir... I wanted to ask you... Do you think that maybe I could take Rose to the spring dance? Well, have you asked her? Not yet. I was going to send her a text later tonight. Text? Why don't you ask her in person? Well, I only see her at school. She's always with her other friends. Well, come over, uh, come over for dinner tonight. Really? It's family dinner. Come over. We always have family dinner. Great. I get off at 6:00. I can head right over. That's fantastic. Teddy... Hi. I have really horrible news. You have horrible news? Yes. Soon as I get out of here, my wife's gonna kill me. Wait, what? All I was supposed to do was duck in, sign some papers, and duck out... that was it. Okay, uh, Teddy, I really need you to listen. They're not gonna let me out of here. Welcome to my world. Okay, Teddy, I'm serious. There's a doctor that I don't even know who came in and signed a form to keep me in here. Teddy... Yeah? Can I talk to you for a minute, please? Right now? Okay. Yeah, sure. Sorry. Just a minute. I'm sorry. Let's go. I'm comin', I'm comin'. He is the man. All right, so don't worry, I'm not gonna... agh! Listen, I thought I told you to stay away from Dolores. What are you... What are you talking about? Listen, if I ever catch you talking to her again, I will lock you up in solitary confinement the rest of your natural-born life. You got me? Guh! Enjoy your lunch, buddy. Uhh. Bueno. Cuando Te vas a la Cantina, Me dices Que vas a la Iglesia. Oh, oh. No es la Verdad. No es la Verdad. O cuando dices Que estas con tus amigos... Bueno? Can I try? O cuando dices Que estas con tus amig... No es la Verdad. Why doesn't this one work? Can I try this one? Bueno, otra mentira. Ni nada me sorprende de ti. Can I just try this one? No! Ni nada me sorprende de ti. Yo sabia Que eso iba a pasar. I just wanted to try one. Cash or credit? Um... Bueno. Ay, Como eres estupido! Me? Hello? What is taking you so long? Hi. Oh, I didn't even know I was taking long. Am I taking... Is this long? On your way home, I need you to stop and get Freddie from school. Apparently, he's in trouble again. I don't have time to deal with this today. What about this? Okay. What if I go outside of the supermarket, I get in the car, and I put my seatbelt on, and I got that thing that's not really a key, but it looks like a key, and then it starts, and then we'll go, and I will go get him at... where am I going? At St. Mary's, where you went this morning? Okay, bye. Is that a hospital? Hello? Oh, now you ready? I'm ready. I was ready when I got here. Where am I going? I don't... Your money. Tengo una linea. Oh, my money, yeah, yeah. Okay, it's not... That time was my fault. The other stuff was your fault 'cause I don't know what you're saying. 'Cause I... Do you speak Spanish? Bueno. Ciao. Okay. Ciao. 2 is 30... 34, 35. 37 beans. 37 beans, I-i-i can't divide by two. Can't to 37 by 2. Th-Th-that's... That's a fraction. That's a fraction of a bean. That's .5, .5 beans. I... 36. 7. Th-Th... 37. I have 37. Means I need two piles of 37 beans. You should try getting a point across to the mad hatter. He can go on for days and days and say nothing! Dang it, Bert. You are so lucky my Moorish friend is not here, or... aah! Oh, thank you. Well, that... that's better. Have either of you guys tried to escape? Are you trying to be funny or something? We've helped you here a ton of times. 14. 14 times. We've escaped 14. 14 times. Would you try it again? Uh, we're gonna need more spoons. 50. Ah. One. One. Here. 49. 49 spoons. We escaped... Oh, 48, 48. Ned... Ned... Ned has one. One and one. We need 48. 48 spoons. We're out of here. Minus two. Ugh. I just happened to overhear your dilemma. Do you work here? Obviously. So you believe me, then? Yes. I do. Unfortunately, we can't talk here. There's too many eyes. I'll make contact with you later in the rec room. Okay. Remember, they're always watching. Always. You have reached your destination. Thank you very much! Dad, it wasn't my fault. Carter dumped them out on Bella. I tried to get them back from there, but it went south from there. Freddie? Aren't you gonna yell at me? But it wasn't your fault! Are you setting me up? You want some ice cream? I prefer orange leaf. Did you get hit in the head? I gotta get my frogs! Hello, Teddy! I'm not going anywhere. Don't you lie to me. I will light you up with 50,000 volts. Do you know what 50,000 volts does to somebody? It'll make you start smokin', and I'll have you smokin' all night long. Now, where were you? I haven't, uh... I'm... I'm... I haven't been anywhere, or... Look... Walking around... I told you to leave Dolores alone. I don't even know where Dolores is! Come on! Come on. I don't know where Dolores... Honey, I'm home! Where have you been? Ugh! Uhh! Is this yogurt? He gets in trouble at school, and you take him for yogurt? Ohh. What? He didn't get in trouble. There was... the principal said he wasn't in trouble. Why are you being so Weir... What... What is all this? Fred, what is this? It's what I got on the list. It was on the list. No... no, it's not. No, on... Ohh. I shouldn't have trusted you. I should have known better. I-I don't know. Oh, please. Seriously. Let's not be silly. Listen. You... Just stay right here, and I will be right back. I'm taking this with me. I got the... Ugh. Wow, you really blew that one. Teddy. Teddy, wake up. Ohh. Teddy, come on. Wake up. Teddy. Teddy, wake up. I need to talk to you. Teddy, look. I know that things have been difficult for you. And I know that Greene has been tough on you too. I know you don't deserve to be in this room, but I can't be with you every second of the day. I need you to settle down. Come on, now, you settle down, or else he's gonna make me medicate you. Oh, my god. And I don't wanna do that. I'm a doctor. I know you're a doctor. Come on, settle down, and I'll take your jacket off, and you can go ahead and eat. Teddy. ♪ Peanut butter and jelly ♪ It's ready! Aah! ♪ Meatballs and spaghetti here are the eggs! ♪ The bees and honey ♪ go together like you and me you told me that we... aah! No. That's a waste. There are people starving in China. Aah! Mom is gonna kill you guys. What are you doing? Have some fun. We're cooking a meal! We're making dinner. Uh, yeah, why? 'Cause we don't have sit-down dinners and nice... We don't? No, we don't, actually. Well, Colin's coming over. What? Who? Colin! Why are you... 'Cause he's your boyfriend! No, he's not! Why would you invite Colin over? I'm home! Come help me. Ooh. Come help me with the groceries, please. What... are you doing? We were just cooking dinner. Minus cookies. That's... that's correct. We were doing that. You ruined my order. No! No, mom! Mom, my life is ruined. My life. They invited Colin over. Colin, mom, Colin. Are you... Are you listening to me? He invited Colin. I'm sorry. Ohh! Okay. Ooh! I'm dead. You... Clean up this mess. And get some food we can actually eat. And you, Mr. Co-conspirator, you come with me, you help me get these groceries. No laughing! Told ya so. Enough! Enough! Just stop it. I can't afford to have my ears bleeding anymore. I need them to hear, all right? I need to think. You're wearing that? I just... I think it'll be a little hard to practice with... with that, uh... With... I guess you just might have to play without me. Sorry. Oh, uh, well... Well, all right, but it's just... It won't be the same. And... You know, it's like we're, uh, breaking up before we even have a hit, uh, you know? So maybe... maybe you could, uh, reconsider. Maybe you could... Y... no, you just... You just don't stop. You don't stop, you just... Stop? You can stop. You can stop talking. Right now, I'm feeling a little bit like Paul McCartney, and you're like John Lennon, and we're on the roof, and the police are on their way. That's a let it be reference! Oh, that's so smart! Uh, okay, well, you know... Do I look like I want to hear this right now? Oh, god, just go, go, go. Go, go, go. I'm gonna go, and then, you know, just when you feel up to it... Yeah. We'll get the band going, though. I'm sure it will work out. I feel good about that. Come on, Bert, let's go. Oh, look, an Asian! Hey, it's Yoko. Oh, my god! Oh, my god. Where did you come from? Where did that... Let's stay on point. I've been over your situation. I think I can help you get out of here. Wait a minute, what... What are you... Are you talking about tonight? Tonight will do just fine, yes. But they're watching you. They are always watching you. Are they watching... Are they watching me, or are they watching everybody? It could be any of them. There's no telling who they're paying off. You mean they're paying their patients to spy on each other? Of course they are. Tonight, then. The south corridor. Just after lights out. Tell no one. I won't. I'm not gonna tell anybody. No one. So... God, that guy looks like he should be in the kings of Leon. Uhh. Aww, Hannibal, they put you in a diaper. Yeah. Because, uh... Well, you know, I poop through my pores. That's why they call me the Pore Pooper. I'm sorry. It's all right. I'm sorry they locked you up in here. Well, maybe they're right. Maybe I do belong in here. Why would you think that? Because... my mom couldn't handle life, so guess I can't either. Your mom is your mom. You... are you. Does that make sense? Yeah. You're probably right. Well, do you want to help me hang these posters? Um... Yeah, because this is good timing. I think it is. I can stick my tape between your arms. That's a good idea, but you might be... You know, just watch out 'cause I might drop it 'cause I have... I have poop slippage. Okay. This is so good. Should we say grace or... Amen? Prayer? Pray? Should we pray? I think we should pray. Ahem. Dear god. I want to thank you and Jesus... And Mary and... Zeus and... Krishna and other... Everyone. It's not just you guys. There's a lot of people watching this. There's the Kabalas and Buddha. Um... the explorers, like Dora and Gollum and... Ike and Tina Turner. Pecos bill. Um, coldplay. That song, yellow, god... Ohh. Makes me sick. And thank you for allowing us to help conceive this one, the little one over there across the table and the other one, the... The daughter, and... the Chinese that brought this food here and slaved away and built an empire, just to make this plate, eventually, for us to enjoy or savor in our mouths, our palates. Okay, well, I think that's it. God bless us all. Merry Christmas. And... I love you. Amen. Amen. Amen. I have to go make another batch of granola. You guys just go ahead and start. You want me to go with you? No, no. You stay here. Eat. I love you so much. Teddy... We're your family here. We don't do this stuff to hurt you. Turn around. It's to protect you. You know that, right? I'm gonna leave this door unlocked, just in case you get upset. Don't do nothin' stupid. All right, good night. Are you going out? Well, yeah, um... Apparently Tom, uh, Sawyer is, uh, having some problems upstream on the river, and, uh, well, Huck is out of town with Becky. It's a real mess, so I gotta go. Oh, that's terrible. Do you... do you think I ought to help? Uh, no, 'cause, uh... Jim's coming by. Really? Oh! Jim is such a hoot. I-I-i, oh, I so enjoy seeing him. He's really, really very funny, I remember. But here... See, here's the thing. You gotta be quiet. Otherwise, Jim's not coming by. You know Jim. Oh, you're darn tootin' I know Jim. Heh. Psst! Oh, my god! What are you doing? Where did you come from? You come here to chit-chat or you wanna get out of here? I need some answers. What kind of answers? I need to know where the filing room is. The file room? That would involve getting past the dogs. Armed guards. Laser beams. I thought this was a minimum-security facility. That's what they want you to think. Fortunately for you, I have maps of the entire facility. Great. These aren't gonna work. Why not? They're maps. I know they're maps. They look like they were drawn up by rain man and Charlie and they all got together and did this mess. That's what they want you to think. Who wants me to think that? I think this is... Looks like a... How to win angry birds. Really? Or what is this, being John Malkovich? That's what that looks like. Well, then, maybe I'll just save them for someone else. There's lots of people who'd like to get their hands on these gems. Please do! That's your life. It's none of my business. Where do I go? Point! Where? Commit. Oh, my god. That way? This way.

Her name is Dolores, and I think there's a connection with Mr. Philbrook. I gotta go. What are you doing? Message deleted. Um, playing. Having a good time. Hi, we're not home. Okay. Uh, will you clean that up so we can start packing? That order has to go out tomorrow afternoon. Doesn't it? Yes. Ohh! Hey! What am I doing here? Hey, I'm sleepwalking. Mm-hmm. Nice try.

Please go change. You know that. So weird. It has been quiet around here today. I remember him saying something about an eclipse. Hey, Freddie's backpack and telescope are gone. So, phh, I don't know what happened. Where do you watch an eclipse? Dad used to take him to the sailing club. Didn't you? So he's probably there. Well, you know, we'll get this loaded and go find him. You know what? No. Forget the bars. Let's just go. Well... No, no, forget it. Okay. I just think... This is... All right, okay. Family. I know. Yes, Mr. Philbrook? Has anyone been in here this morning? I mean, other than that cleaner guy? No one that I know of. No. All right, Anna. Thank you. Security, this is Mr. Philbrook. Upload the security tapes from this morning to my hard drive. You all right? No. No, I'm not all right. You, on the other hand, act like there's nothing going on. What the... Fred!

I'm happy for you. I... am not kidding. I really am. And I'm telling you this because this is... Because why? Um... Because I... I sort of... Wait. Wait, Dr. Mulberry? Why does that name sound so familiar? Because... Because I did it. I'm so sorry. Wait... you signed me in here. Wait, why would you sign me in here? Uh... That's what I'm trying to tell you. Because it has something to do with your father. My father? I don't even know him, and you're telling me he's the reason I'm locked up in here? I'm... yes, I'm... Look, I'm so sorry, Dolores. But you told me that I'm not sick, don't you remember? You told me that! I know. I believe you're not sick. Of course you're not sick. I just didn't know all this other crap at the time. Just... just stop talking. No, no, no, just for... No, I'm not going back there! No, I don't want to do it anymore! Dolores, calm down. Get away, Teddy. What's going on here? Look, she's having some kind of a schizophrenic break here. No, I am not! Get back! Get away from me. Do not touch the patients, Mr. Greene. Look, she needs to be in isolation right now. What? You can't... Now! John, get her outta here. No! Stop it, please! Get her out of here. Get her out of here. No! No, let me alone, please! Listen, you better take care of Teddy right now, or I'm gonna do it myself. Everybody, Dolores is okay. Just go back to what you were doing. Come on, Teddy. Come on. I need to go with you. I know, I need to go check on Dolores. Please take me with you. I just need you to come over here and sit down. Please take me with you. Please? No, I can't take you with me. Teddy, I can't take you with me. Just sit down. Please take me with you. Teddy, I'm going to go check on Dolores. Just sit down. I'll be right back. Uh-oh. No, no. No. No. I need to... hi. May I have this dance? Um... I'm sorry. I apologize. And what I did earlier... I take full responsibility for. And I don't know where I was at. And I need your help. Well, I couldn't stay mad at you if I could forgive that Willy Wonka. And, believe me, he had a temper. Diabetic with a sweet tooth. So what... so what... You're still getting out of here, right? Yes, of course I'm getting out of here. So what's... What's the plan? I need to trust you. Can I trust you on this? Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. You can trust... I'm your roommate. Teddy, you're my best friend. You can trust me. Okay. But I think we really ought to include the guys. Great, I'm fine with that. All right, pay attention. He breaks out tomorrow, so we only have today to prep. Everyone in? Do not forget about Dolores on this, okay? We are bringing Dolores. We just have to find a way past Richard. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Oh, my god, your breath is really... It's really bad. Okay, somebody, um... Someone start this and then just end it soon. Uh... Do you know it? No, no. One for... One for all and all for one. One! One! Here we go. Let's... go, go. What are you doing? Just... move, every... Oh, my god. Unbelievable. Help! Help! Oh, my... Hold on, Freddie!

Ouch, you're hurting... Sorry. Okay. Oh. Fred, are you okay? Oh! You okay? Fred? Okay, now, pick up the rope and... and throw it up here, and we'll catch it. One, two... Two. Three! Oh, no! Oh, we got it! No, we got it! We did it! We got it! Okay. Okay. Good job. All right, here we go. Ah. Okay. I got it, I got it. I'm helping. No. Here, you need help? I'm still coughing. Oh. Oh, honey. Hello, Lorna. Mr. Philbrook. How are you? Fred. I need to speak to you. Good luck. Alone. What are you trying to pull? I don't know what you're... Breaking into my office. I ought to have you arrested. Mr. Philbrook... Don't you get smart with me. You're up to something. I can tell. Stay away from my speech tomorrow. I've given you everything you've got, and I can take it away, just like that. Good evening, Teddy. Hi! Hello. I wish I had my invisible cloak. I don't know how I'm gonna take all the books we're gonna need for this mission. I don't know how I'm gonna do it. There's... there's... It's... We need every one of these books on this bed. Every single one of these books. And we don't need the whole books, we just need like little passages from some of them. But every book on this bed is gonna help us to get to where we need to go, and I... I... I don't know how I'm gonna do it. And then I gotta put clothes in here too. 'Cause I have to... I can't wear the same thing two days in a row. I've got... I have to have different clothing. You know, if I had that invisibility cloak, this would be a moot point. Whoa. Can I come in? Okay? Yeah? So... Found a delivery service that can take out the boxes tomorrow. I know! It's great, isn't it? That's... yes. That's great! It's good. No, that's amazing. Yeah! Yeah. So that's good. Yes! Um... are you good? You were kind of quiet at dinner, you know. Little bit. Yeah, it was just... You know, I'm just... Is everything okay with Mr. Philbrook? Yes. Are you sure? Yeah, just, you know. It's... it's fi... You know. He's... He's not nice to me. He's never nice to you. And you just take it and you... Sorry. You know, I actually, I just... I came out here to... Apologize. I, uh... I always criticize you for putting your work first, in front of us and the kids, and I didn't even know that my son was gone. Our son. So, you know, I'm just gonna, I don't know, take a step back or something and... Put what's really... you know, what really matters first, which is the kids, and... and you, and our marriage. What's left of our marriage. You know? If you want to come back inside tonight... Well... The invite's open.

What, you think I don't know my own husband? I'm... I'm a patient from the Fitzpatrick. And I... I just, um... I've always wanted a family. I've always wanted a family. So I just jumped...

We didn't notice for two days. I mean... That's a long time. God, what have we done? I don't know. I'm sorry. I... Don't, um... I think the best thing to do is to... I guess call the facility and a... ask for nurse Nancy. Okay. She's the one that I deal with the most. Okay. And you could just ask her what I'm supposed to do or what to do next. 'Cause I don't really know. Give me that ring. Okay. Here. It's not... That's not mine. What's the number? I don't know. I don't know. It's... I... I don't. I-I live there, so I don't...

Well, check the rec room, okay? They couldn't have wandered too far. Okay, okay, uh... Wait a minute. Is Dolores one of the missing patients? Yes, ma'am, she is. Alert Richard, and tell the rest of the staff to be on alert. Tell them to report a code 42. 42? Okay, okay. All right, now what? How do we get out of this? Guys... Door number four.

How could you let this happen? Look, I had her in isolation. You and those useless rent-a-cops better keep them away from this press conference or you're through. Security team, be on the lookout for a 17-year-old girl with black hair. She's probably surrounded by a bunch of lunatics. This is a code red. Wait, here's a phone. Yeah. Teddy. Sit down. It's okay. Fitzpatrick mental health. This is nurse Nancy. Oh, my god. Teddy's where? Then that means your husband just drove off with a truckload of mental patients. Hold on a second. Someone's calling. Hello? Oh, thank goodness, it's you. It's him? Is it dad? Are you okay? Dad? I love you. I... I love you too! You were right about philbrook, and I-i... I need your help. Just tell us where to go. We're in this together. Lorna! Teddy! Guys, come on. Come on. Oh! I'm sorry, Lorna. I never meant to let you and the kids down. Honey. Teddy! I'm sorry too, honey. I love you. I always have. I just... Forgot. So did I. Okay, if this parent trap moment is over, I'd still like to take down philbrook. I'm sorry, but I haven't really kissed my husband in almost a year. Wow. Teddy? I-I'm Fred. I'm Dr. Frederick mulberry. I always thought that... That there was something missing? Me too. You're so handsome. That's what I tell her every day. I've always wanted a brother. Let's go. Can I have y'all come to the stage, please? If I become governor of this great state... All right, does everybody have their part? No, what about me? Oh, no, you stay with your sister. It's too dangerous. Actually, yeah. No, no, no. You guys go as a decoy with Bert. I'm Bert. Perfect! I am honored to be... I am honored to be here. Hey! Over here! She's with the creeps! No, she's with me! Mulberry, what are you doing here? I told you to stay away. I'm finished doing what you tell me to do. You're making a big mistake. My mistake was not putting my family first. Clearly that is not a concern for you. Hey, mister, can we have your autograph? Sure. Whatever. Here you go. Thank you. You got a pen already? Yeah. This conversation is over, mulberry. Fortunately for me, it doesn't matter what you think. How about what I think... Dad? Young lady, d-do I know you? Security! You're really going to deny me again? I don't know who you are. She knows. We all know. My mother died because of you. And you've had me locked up in there for years. You're my father. How could you do that? You can't prove that. Oh, of course I can. Well, come on. Let's be reasonable. I'm... I'm sure we can come to some kind of, uh, a financial resolution. It's not about the money. It's about the family. I already had a family. Your mother tried to blackmail me. I couldn't raise you and... And my other family. I'm out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm really happy to be here with you today, and I want to announce what I... What about family values? Yeah! It... it was all a mis... Everybody... Ladies and gentlemen, please... It was a... It was a mistake! Honey! Honey! Honey! Teddy! Been waiting on this for a long time. It's time for a little shock therapy. Say hello to my little friend. Now, come on, dear. That woman is not my daughter. Mulberry, you're through. I'll see you in court. So much for family values. Are you all right? Yeah. For the first time in a long time. Dr. Mulberry, I am so sorry. You're gonna have to find yourself an attorney. But it was a mistake. I had no way of knowing. Not for you. I have a brother, and I'm gonna make it official. Well, the book says you... Ah, to heck with the book.
