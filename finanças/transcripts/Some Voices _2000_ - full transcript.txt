They don't want me any more. Don't think I'm crazy enough. I think you're crazy. Thanks for picking me up, Pete. When you opened the boot and you put my bags in the back, it was a good feeling. I mean, I really had that leaving feeling. You know that feeling, that feeling of leaving? And arriving. I'm sorry I didn't make the wedding. Kind of tied up, hey? I'd have been a good best man. Got a book all about it, how to get educated on being a best man. Oh, what did it say? Don't know. I never read it. I'm sorry I didn't make the divorce. Yeah, well, you didn't miss much. Quick, wasn't it? Yeah. I mean it, Pete. I'm really sorry. You've been growing into an old fart without me. I'll be with you in a minute. You all right, Pete? Oh, yeah, I'm all right. You all right? Where've you been? You know, here and there. You know you're not supposed to be drinking, don't you? I was thirsty. Just get yourself some breakfast and take your medication, will you. You make me nervous. Do you know what those are? Yeah, I know what they are and I know you need them. They've like horse tranquilizers. Of a smack in the head with a claw hammer, if you know what that's like. Do you want one? No, thank you. Calm you down. Come on. Here. Swap? No, no swaps! Yeah, swap. Ray, this is Mandy. You ever need anything and I'm not around, she'll sort you out. All right. Hello. Six for a pound. Any color you like. Got any orange ones? Any color you like, except orange. I need an orange one. Just what's there, mate. Have another blue one. No, I got a blue one. I need an orange one. Can I just take five? Pay for five, I'll give you six. No, just the five. Oh, take six. Push the boat out. Five for a pound. Come here! Come here! Where's that ring? I've lost it! Well, where did you lose it then? If I knew that, it would not be lost would it? That was a five stone sapphire, ...and a cluster, a fucking cluster. That was a good ring! I don't want your stupid ring! I want it you silly bitch. Obviously you do want my ring, which is why I want it so I can get my money back. Fuck! That's it. What are you going to do with that? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to count to three and then I'm going to get fucking angry. You are already angry. Well, I'm going to get even more angry! Put the brick down. Fuck off. Go on. You could put someone's eye out with that. It's dangerous. Is it? Who the fuck are you? Huh? Nobody. Who the fuck is this? Huh? I don't know. He's just some nut case. A word of advice, nut case, right? A wee gem of wisdom, yeah? Uh! Don't ever, ever, ever fuck with another man's misery. Ok? He was lucky. He caught me when I wasn't looking. You ought to mind your own business next time then, won't you? Done. I think my nose is broken. Can you stand up? No. Try. It's the sitting down that's done it. I think I've got um, what's his name? Rigor mortis. Lift your shirt up. What are you going to do? You probably cracked a rib. What's wrong? It's cold. Does this hurt? No, it's nice. What's the date today? I don't know, why? When's your birthday? 23rd of August. I'm a Leo. How's your head? Does he often do this sort of thing? Fling bricks about and nut people. It's not very nice. There's a first time for everything. Now you just stop asking stupid questions. I've met his sort before. He probably practices. I mean it's not the first time this has happened to me. It's not first time I've completely unwittingly provoked somebody. I just seem to say the wrong thing or look at them in the wrong way and boom! It just all goes off. Look, I've got to go. I don't mean to be rude, but I've got an appointment. Ok. I'll be off then. I'll be on my way. What happened to your face? Nothing. You see your nurse today? Yeah. What did she say? She said, keep up the good work and come back in two weeks. Two weeks? Why two weeks? Why not two weeks? Well, was your face like that when you went to see her? Don't tell me you walked into a door. Always walking into doors, weren't you? Ever since you were a kid, you'd disappear off the face of the Earth and walk into a door somewhere. All right. Don't get in a flat. Two Kelly sausage, table five. You weren't arrested again, were you? Because I'll tell you, Ray, I'm not having it. Not again. Fucking coppers knocking on my door at four in the morning, just because you made a tit out of yourself. Two Kelly sausage, table five. What the bloody hell is going on? ...I just don't understand it, you know? Nobody understands it. I mean, why can't you just pull yourself together? They changed their minds. What? They want pizza now. Well, they can't have pizza. You tell them... I could give you a hand. No. I'll do the washing up. Look, I've got an imbecile to do that, thank you. Hey! Come on, leave the stuff in there. Jesus. Remember when Dad was there, I used to wash up. It was his dream of having a gaffe like this, wasn't it? Was it? All that simple stuff. Liver, beans, and bangers. He couldn't give it away. Yeah, well I do all right with it in a day's ..., don't I? And at night you do this. Like a bistro. Bistro. I'll knock you one in a minute. It's fucking Iranian, isn't it? Pizzas and curly sausage, gourmet pizza with smoked salmon. ...sour cream. The yuppies love it. Pesto calzone for table four. What did happen to your nose? I met this bird. Her old man was giving her a bit of a hard time. He was going to knack her with a brick. You just had to stick your nose in, didn't you? I just told him to pack it in. Oh good plan, Ray. I'm sure that worked a treat. Jesus. When you going to learn? What was I supposed to do? It's not your problem. It's her problem. Everybody's got their own problems in this life. Everyone has got a hand of card that they're dealt. And if someone's got a bad card, you don't go and pick out their bad card, do you? You don't believe me, do you? You've got your own bad cards, mate. All right? Night. Night. See you in the morning. Night, Mandy. She your girlfriend, then? She's my waitress. You given her a tickle yet? I never mix business with pleasure, Ray. You like her though, don't you? I don't dislike her. You're fond of her as a person. I'm not not fond of her. She's just staff. Seems a bit unnatural to me, that's all. What's unnatural about it? I just don't fancy her that's all. No, I mean, I'm here now. I could work for you. You can trust me. I can trust her. I wouldn't trust that kitchen hand. He looks like a lazy prick to me. Here you are, Ray. What's this? Money. You can go and see that woman tomorrow. Oh, well, if you don't want it. Ray, Ray. Sorry. Don't like those. Give me the shakes. Can't change unless you try them properly, can you? And they make my muscles stiff. They really slow me down. Well maybe you need slowing down. Well maybe you need speeding up. Laura! Laura! Here. Is this what you wanted? Fuck off. Well, where am I supposed to go? A fucking youth hostel? Catch! Fucking bitch! Stupid cow. Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura! Get off me! Hello. Hi. Can I get a pint of lager, please? How much is that? Is there anybody sitting there? Does it look like anybody is sitting there? Can I sit there? It's nice here. All my friends come here. They're not here at the moment though. Do you fancy a drink. What I fancy is to be left alone. I don't want to talk to anybody. I don't want to drink with anybody, smile at anybody, play let's get to know each other with anybody. I don't want to know. I'm in a bad mood. Why did you come here then? Because I'm in a bad mood. You all right? I'm up the duff, if you must know. Anything else you'd like to ask? I'm surprised people still want to have babies these days. Seems such an old fashioned mumsy thing to do. No, hold on. What is the matter with you? I just want to talk to you. What about? I don't know. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you. You don't get to know people by just walking up to them in a pub and talking absolute fucking rubbish to them. Yes, you do. You have very beautiful eyes. You don't give up, do you? Not really, no. Do you want a drink? Vodka, double. I'm Ray by the way. Laura. You know, you shouldn't be smoking in your condition. There's a lot of things I shouldn't be doing. Me too. Personally I like to live as if I'm going to die tomorrow. You might do. Can I have a feel? I beg your pardon. Here. Look, I'm quite tired. I'm going to go for a sleep now. Oh, I hate sleeping. It's boring. Yes. It is pretty boring. I get nightmares. It's probably because I'm so intelligent. What do you get nightmares about? Everything. It's just your subconscious sorting things out for you. As long as you don't dream your date then you're ok. You're a good kisser. Nice firm lips. So, what shall we do now? I'm not fucking you, you realize. It's out of the question. I didn't ask you to fuck me. I'm not fucking anybody for the time being. I don't want you to. Fucking people isn't the answer to anything. I don't want to. And I'm not... either. I don't want to. Well, now that we've got that sorted out, I'm going to go. Will I see you again? What kind of a question is that? It makes sense to me. Giving up. Fuck me. It's... No, it isn't. I can tell. How can you tell, you're numpty. I've just got this feeling. You don't believe in all that bollocks, do you? No. They do. They do it to show they were here, that they exist. Who? Two pensioners with a plank? See? Two pensioners with a plank were here. It's fucking deadly. Do you have any sea urchins? Sea urchins. I don't think so. Thanks anyway. Hello? God, Ray. Where are you? Hastings. Hastings? What are you doing in Hastings? I'm with that bird I told you about. Bird, what bird? The one I told you about. Oh, Jesus. What's wrong? She's just fast work, that's all. Yeah well, it's a fast world, Pete. Great. Look, when are you coming home? I don't know. Maybe we'll come home tomorrow. Maybe we'll come home in two weeks. Are you out of your fucking mind? Look, can I come and get you? I can't hear you, Pete. The pips have gone. I've got no more change. What did he say? He said we could stay as long as we like. Do you always have to phone him when you go somewhere? No, He gets lonely. Just ring him to cheer him up a bit. Why am I doing this? Help keep your mind off things. Really? Well get out, go on, off it. I'm letting you go. Well, I can't do anything right, can I? Well, that's why I'm letting you go. Go on. Now I'm doing his job. Where's it going to end, hey? You'll burn your fingers. Wow. Wow. Now they know we're here. You know what I'm thinking? How could I possibly know what you're thinking? I'm thinking this is destiny. I'm not being funny. We met when we needed to meet. Imagine if we'd never met. Imagine if we'd each met somebody else who we didn't need to meet and we'd spent the rest of our life in a meaningless spiral of mediocrity and disillusion, never even aware of each other, always needing, but at the same time always assuming that this was as good as it gets, that there's no cure, that life's just in black and white. It's all repeats and the fucking telly is broken anyway. I did meet somebody else. We thought we needed each other. It's a sign. What's it a sign of? It's meaningful. What does it mean? I don't know. I don't know what it means. It's just meaningful. Are you trying to tell me something? I just did. And I told you, I need to be on my own. Why? Because it's my destiny to be moody and isolated sometimes until I'm old and gray. I wasn't asked me to marry me. You never will if you don't want to smack in the gums. Kiss my eyes. No, stop. No keep going. Here, on my mouth. Now squash me, on top. Why? I want to fee your weight. Like this? Harder. Squeeze the breath out of me. Why? It makes me feel safe. Ow. You're not very good at this, are you. Relax. It's not a driving test. Lower. A bit higher. Down a bit. Just there. You all right, man? Hello. This is exactly what Dad used to do. It's how he pissed this place away. He had a good thing going here and he pissed it away by drinking and disappearing and falling over everywhere. Dad was a drunk. That's what drunks do. Is that how you want to end up? Is it? Because you never went through with him what I went through. You bought him out. It was the one thing he loved and you took it away from him. I had no choice Ray, and you know it. He couldn't do it, could he? You couldn't do it. Well, could you? Do I have to stand over you at home, morning, noon, and night every night for the rest of your life and for the rest of mine? I been looking for those everywhere. Haven't I got enough to contend with. Drugs are bad for you. Everyone knows that, I'm weaning myself off of them. I'm going for a more holistic approach. You don't have to worry about me. I feel great. I know. I know, that's the trouble. At least give him a chance. Washing dishes is a lot more complicated than it looks. You got to be quick. Letting stuff pile up, that means I'm short of clean stuff. Ok. And you got to be thorough and tidy. No water on the floor. Somebody sleep on their bum and break their neck. Ok. And if I say I need something in a hurry, you drop what you doing and you do it, all right? And you're in charge of bread. 45 seconds in the oven and you dump that in. Ok. And always listen to the intercom. It's a lot to remember, I know. Ray, go down to the cellar, fetch us six bottles of Bulgarian and six Bordeaux. We're not doing the Bulgarian anymore. Says who? Doesn't go with the cock-a-leekie. It goes with the coq au vin. Well, it's Romanian now. Oh, big difference. Coq au vin is so cafe. Can't we think of something else? Basil risotto with goat cheese bruschetta. Scallops with avocado couscous and fresh fennel? Anything else? I just thought you might fancy a change. Change is as good as a rest. I just thought I'd run it up the flagpole. See what salutes. And if it's not broke, don't fix it. Yeah, but you can't make an omelet without cracking eggs. I know how to make an omelet, Ray. Too many cooks spoil the broth. No. Just get downstairs, will you? Everyone's a comedian. I'm sorry. I was only trying to help. I know. I know. I appreciate it. In fact, up to a point, I like it. Insecure, overweening pride. Six letters, ending in I-S. Penis. That's five letters. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Oh, no, go ahead. No skin off my nose, Do you miss her? Uh, no, no. But I never really missed her, no. Thanks. She divorced me. You missed Ray though. Yes, you did. I think you did. He missed you. Yeah, well, I missed him for a while. God knows why. Then do you miss your husband at all? Well, he's not my husband anymore, so no. I miss having someone to talk to sometimes. I miss, I miss knowing someone so well that, well, you don't have to talk. Don't have to talk. That's true, isn't it? Like you and Ray. You're very lucky. I suppose so. You're different, now he's around. More fun. More funny. ...funny strange or funny ha, ha? Just more, more dynamic. Dynamic? Am I? You're just different. I think it's sweet. So are you. I mean, no. I mean, I feel different. I feel better. Everything to your satisfaction? Laura, this is Pete. Hello. Hello. Laura. Oh, dear. Do you want to have a drink? No, I'm all right, thanks. You all right? Look, I should be going. No. It's all right. This isn't what it looks like. So now you're having girlfriends over, are you? So do you. I'm allowed to have friends over, Ray. I don't ask much, but I do ask for a bit of sensitivity. But no, it's always the same with you, right? Just me, me, me, me. And never put anything on top of your cheese or it dries it out, all right? When you're finished, take one of these. You know, I don't like it. It's all or nothing, Sunshine, all right? Do you want it or not? Lovely. Thanks. Two salmon and asparagus pizzas for Table 10. You know there's two bases made up. Why don't you start them off? I can finish them later. You have to try harder than that, Sunshine. There you go. Just what the doctor ordered. You said it, mate. That's really good, that. - There you go. - Thanks. Enjoy your meal. Ray. Yes, boss? You're scraping your plates, aren't you? Yes, boss. Before you wash them, you scrape them. All right. Right, boss. And don't call me boss. Right, boss. Hang on. What the fuck is this about? Why you do these things, hey? You know I'm going to go berserk. Fuck me. Have I got a giant red button right here, with push me on it in big white letter. I've worked with some fucking boners in my time, but this is just vandalism. God knows what's going to happen to those poor people when they get home. Well you don't mind me taking them, do you? That's different. How is that different? ...deserting me. Oh, right. You won't give it to customers No, no. You won't give it to them because they're real people. You know your trouble, Ray, is you're just fucking selfish. You're fucking selfish. Oh, am I? Well, maybe my wife left me because I'm the selfish kind who worked his balls off and I never went home. Hey? Yeah, yeah. You were. And when I tried to save Dad and his dirty old cafe, I was just being selfish. You were. I rebuilt that place. You know, I'd have fucked off years ago if I'd had a choice. Yeah, I'd have pissed off to the seashore with some bird I met in a pub. I'd have loved it. Why didn't you, Pete? Because it wouldn't helped Dad, would it? Well, help me! I am helping you! I just don't know whether I'm ...with you, you know. I mean, is it you? Is this what you think of me? Or is it... Is it this? Maybe there's nothing wrong with you. Maybe you're just like this, hey? Maybe it's your personality. Maybe you're just a wanker. Well, say what's on your mind, Pete, don't be shy. I mean, if it's all too much trouble for you, you only have to say it. I'll take that as a yes then. I'll make a deal with you. You do what you're supposed to do and I'll help you find another job and somewhere to live, all right? I've already found somewhere. What will she think of all this? It was her idea. Oh, well, I mean, you've known her for the whole of two weeks. How well do you know her, Ray? How well does she know you? Does she know everything? Are you going to tell her? Just behave yourself, all right? You know, make yourself useful about the place. Ok. Don't fuck up, all right? And if you have any bother, you know where I am, don't you? Oh, hello. Hello. Hello. I've brought my things, my worldly goods. I see. I see you have. We weren't sure if you were sure what time to expect us. We can always come back. You're a bit confused. We're confused. No. There's not a real problem, is there? You, you got the wrong day. I got the wrong day. I got the wrong day. Absolutely. I remember now. Well, come inside then. You silly fucking... Sausage? Silly sausage. Yes. What are we like. Feel. He'll be wanting to come out soon enough. He'll be walking about and talking and expecting to learn things. What am I going to teach him? I dreamt I already had it. It was. Tiny it was about the size of my thumb, and it was blue and white and red and made of plastic. And it had a red light on it that told you it was still alive. And I worked out that the light meant how warm it was. And I got worried that I wasn't keeping it warm enough. And I went to the pub and when I got back, the light had gone out. It was dead. I was so ashamed. Which pub? You're not even listening to me. You're bonkers. You're bonkers. You're bonkers. Look at you. Your lights are on and there's nobody within miles. I'm serious. So am I. You popped your cork. You flipped your lid. You are definitely off the stock, as they say. Oh, you think so, do you? I do, yes. Why else would you put up with me? I don't know. You're a fool. Give us a kiss. Pete? Oh, my god. What have you done? It's Ray's. Realistic, isn't it? Why so miserable? He's gone. Gone where? Gone to live with his girlfriend. So, that's good, isn't it? That's all medication does for you. Voices I bet you. What are you whittering about? I never even realized. I was watching that. I love watching you dress. It's one of my most favorite things, watching you dress. Ray. For fuck's sake. Why do you listen to this bollocks anyway? I fancy a swim. If it clears up later, we can go to the Lido. Hello. What? No. No. Look, I said no. Who was that? Take a wild guess. What did you do that for? It's time he learned. Hello. Has there been any change in your circumstances? Yeah. I changed address. Please fill out the form. Put your new address. Are you on housing benefit? Yeah, why? Are you two together? No. You're not together? If you're living together, you must fill out a form to claim as a couple. Fill out this form if you're on any other benefits. Is your partner on benefits? Wait a moment. Excuse me. What did you do that for? Didn't you see the way she was staring at me? She wasn't staring at you. She was staring at me. I hate it when they do that. I'm fucking sick of it. Sick of what? Everything. Ray. Ray. I'm hearing things. Sounds, voices, whispering. It's just the traffic. People, like ghosts. And the houses, they're talking to me, asking me questions. It's just the neighbors. Somebody's telly. I'm going mad. How are you feeling? What if something happens, you die before me. Don't say that. Nothing is going to happen. And this is going to stop this as well. Why? Because I want you to be old and wise. I'll never be old and wise. Old and stupid, maybe. Look, you've just got to have a little bit of faith in things. It's what my mom used to say. She wasn't a believer, but she sometimes used to read the Bible. Said it reminded her of happier times. What do you do to remind yourself of happier times? These are happy times. I'm happier than I've ever been. See? I know how to get you better. Ray, I think you should spend some more time with Pete. He's your family and you haven't seen him in weeks. I mean, we can't spend all our time cooped up together like battery chickens. You're the only one who understands me. Don't answer it. Hello? No. No. How many times do I have to tell you? Ok. Ok. Hang up. Hang up! He wants me to meet up with him tonight. What are you going to do? He's going to find out sooner or later. Hello, Pete? Hello? Ray? Ray, is that you? Ray. I just wanted to talk to you. Wanted to see how you are. ...Yeah, me too, Ray, me too. Look, why don't you come over for Sunday dinner, hey? Bring Laura. You're always welcome. Be really nice, Pete, yeah. So you're all right? No, no, I'm... yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Really, yeah. Ta. What did he say? He wants to go back to Glasgow with him for fuck's sake. What did you say? What do you think I said? What are you thinking? For fuck's sake. I would sooner go to the moon. Oh, my god! What happened to you? Hello. I thought you'd been hit by a car. What are you doing? It's an experiment. Where's your clothes? I don't need clothes. I'm invisible. Ray, cover yourself up. You see the way people are looking at me. They're looking at me like I shouldn't be here. They're looking straight through me. But this means I'm here. It's a spiral. Oh, and well, look. That's the direction of the spiral, obviously. What are you looking at? Get inside. Come on. That's the thing. They can't hear me either. Get inside. When I'm depressed, I become invisible. Maybe not. I'm calling a doctor. I don't like doctors. They make me nervous. I fancy a bath. I'm stuffed like a pig. I'm absolutely... Mandy, have another drink. I'll even pour it for you. You can coach me on my technique. You don't need any coaching. I think you've had enough for one day. That's where you're wrong, Pete old boy. I haven't even started. Thank you. That was delicious. My compliments to the chef. So when is it due? Sorry? I couldn't help noticing you showing. Sorry, am I being nosy? In December. Just in time for Christmas. Is it kicking yet? So now we're talking about babies? If it kicks you, kick it back. Give yourself a do-it-yourself abortion. Save yourself the agony. I mean, I'm not being funny, but you should see the father. Christ knows what's going to hatch. Ray! Fuck. She's having a baby for Christ's sake. Have you consider the implications? I tell you what. Why don't you consider them for me? Take a picture. It lasts longer. You leave her alone. What have you done to him, hey? You cast a spell on him? What don't you mind your own business? When's it due? Is it kicking yet? Am I being nosy? Yes, you are, you stupid fucking tart. How dare you? Well, you must be. No one's shagged him in at least five years. Enough. Yeah, you're right Ray. It's not my business and I can't make it my business. Now get out. Hey? Go on. Piss off. Just let him go. I'm sure it's for the best. How do you know what's for the best. Nobody knows what's best. Haven't got a fucking clue. It's just your opinion, isn't it? You're just guessing. It's a fucking mystery and it's ugly and complicated and scary. Nobody has the answers and the only way to deal with it is to hit a bottle and panic and lose my shit and that's the way it should be. Would you at least think about it? Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. Look, I know I'm in trouble. I can tell things are going wrong. But I love you. What the fuck is going on here? Who is this? Ah, Christ. Don't you ever give up, pal? Hey, hey, what the fuck is he doing? Huh? He's fucking idiotic. Now you know what happened last time. Don't get me angry here, pal, ok? Look. What did you think was going to happen here, huh? You think she's going to settle down with you? Have a family? He's a nobody. You're nobody here. Is this what you want? Master and Mrs. Fucking Nobody and all their little fucking nobodies, yeah? You can be quite funny when you want to be. I'm a fucking scream when I want to be. You're fucking mad. Period. What's he doing, huh? Leave. I've had enough of this. Leave. Oh! Is he going to be all right? He's ok. Yeah, he's going to be fine. It just looks really bad. Are you ok? I'm fine. He didn't mean it. Ray! Ray! Come on. Stay in the car. Got a light? Jesus, what are you doing? This is where it all happened, isn't it? This is where the wheels fell off the bus. This is my work, Ray. All right? This is my life. Yeah, and Dad's life before you. And my life once. You're ill. All right? You were sick. Remember? Yeah, I suppose I was. After I killed Mom. What? Well, that's what people think, isn't it? That's what Dad thought. She died of breast cancer, mate. It was nothing to do with you, was it? I drove Dad to drink. Because of me. No, he was always like that. He couldn't make this place work. It was just circumstance. Yeah, but you could, couldn't you? Well, you never missed a trick. What if something happens to you? Nothing's going to happen, all right? Now come on. Things move by themselves. Things change color. But only when I'm here. I make things happen. Stop fucking pissing about, Ray! It's a sign. What's it a sign of? I don't know. It's a sign. Fuck. Jesus. Fuck. Just one more time. No. Just to be sure. Fuck. Ray, come on. Shh. Ray. Shh. I'm concentrating. What's it you're hearing, hey? What's it say to you? All kinds of things. Ray! I can't stand this any longer! They say some pretty weird things to me. Fucking spooky things. I know, Ray. But listen. You got to listen to me. What do you think it is? Do you think it's God? I don't believe in God. Well, neither do I. You know what would have made me happy? I have no idea. If I'd turned out a bit more like you. At least you can cook. You know what I think? I think I've wasted my life. Ray, don't fucking do that! Please! I expect this will be the only cooking you ever see me do. Ray! Go fuck yourself! Enough! Enough! Last one! Fuck off. Ray, don't. Ray. Tell me you can see me, Pete. What? Tell me I'm here. What's going to happen to me? Nothing. Nothing's going to happen. All right? Nothing ever? What do you want to happen? Don't want to go back to hospital. All right. It's all right. Yeah. It's all right now. Isn't it? Yeah, I know it's all right. I know. It just doesn't seem all right. Hello. Hello. How are you feeling? I'm all right. You look tired. I'm all right. It's a nice room. Yeah, they let me paint it. Used to be pink. Pink is supposed to cheer you up, I find it a bit depressing really. Can you come for a walk? I'm going to go home to have the baby. With Dave? Don't be stupid. Have you seen him? He's been seen staggering around various Glasgow pubs, ranting about the horror of London. Will you come back? Not for a while, no. Not until you've had the baby and you feel a bit better. Not for a while. Not for a long while, no. How long? I can't say exactly. Roughly. I don't know, Ray. You got no idea at all. A few months? How many months? Six? Six. Yeah, maybe six. Six months ok. Six months, exactly or less? It's just a guess, Ray. Don't be upset. I'm not upset. I just never met anybody like you before. You will again, one day. No. I don't think so. Onions. Always fry them in butter, especially for soups. Well, we've got a tin of soups in here anyway, but if you want to make pasta sauce, always use butter or oil. Laura always used to use butter. And always put your onions well in before your garlic, all right? Garlic burns too quick. Onions before, got it. And never use tins of... They're too watery. Laura always bought tinned. Well, it's not advisable. She get off all right? Yeah, yeah, she's gone. Took her to the station. What do you want to put in now? Mushrooms. She was a lovely girl, wasn't she, Pete? Very beautiful, very special. Everything about her was just special. And you know, just very thoughtful and nice. Sure she's thinking about you now. I'm sure you'll never stop thinking about each other. No. Happens to the best of us, you know? You're on your own for a while and then you meet someone and then you're on your own again, you know? Swings and roundabouts. Come on, it's the basil now. Always use more than you think you'll need. Doesn't grow on trees, but use it like it does. Be generous with it. Like that? Yeah, yeah. Here you go. Make sure it doesn't stick to the edges.
