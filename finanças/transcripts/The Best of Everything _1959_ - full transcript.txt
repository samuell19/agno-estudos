Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [Chorus Vocalizing] We've proven romance is still The best of everything That sudden thrill The best of everything That one little sigh Is treasure you cannot buy Or measure by any test The best of everything You found the moon and the sun Yes, he's the one, it seems [Chorus Vocalizing] But soon it's done And not the fun it seems You walk through the night Just groping, it's still all right You're hoping Love can be all or nothing But even when it's nothing It's still the best The best of everything We've proven Romance is still The best Of Everything [Horn Honks] - Hi. - Hi. Where is everyone? You're early. Give it two more minutes, then run for cover. - First day, first job? - How'd you know? The hat. Good luck. Thanks. [Chattering] [Bell Tolling] [No Audible Dialogue] - Just a minute. Will you lay off that for a minute? - Coffee? I'm trying to talk to Bob. Morning. You from the employment agency? - Yes. I'm Caroline Bender. - I'm Mary Agnes, head of the typing pool. Bring your card? "Dictation: 120 words a minute." - Not bad. What college? Vassar? - Radcliffe. I went to business school myself. You have to take a typing test. Type this page. Two of my girls went off and got married. You're one of the replacements, if you pass the test, that is. You married? - No. - Engaged? - Not officially. - I know. I was unofficial myself for two years. But now we're rolling along. We're gonna be married a year from last month. That's practically tomorrow. Well, you want a $200 wedding dress, it takes a lot of paychecks. - Two hundred? - I'm working on the nightgown now. $70. - What's it made of, dollar bills? - Listen, it's made of nothing. You could hide it in your fist. You should hear what my boyfriend says. He says... Well, never mind what he says. Ready? Accuracy counts. Go. [Typing Continues] - Time. - Who's that? Mike Rice. He's editor of a magazine that keeps the teenagers shaped up. Big seller. It's scary when you think that... he's the only thing between us and all those delinquents. Keeps you staring at the ceiling nights. Perfect. You're hired. - Hope you like it here. - Thank you. I do too. - Good morning, Mary Agnes. - Morning, Mrs. Lemont. There's a rush on that material I gave you last night. Let me have it as soon as possible. Will do. That's the assistant beauty editor of America's Woman. - She's not engaged. - She's pretty. A lot of good it does her. She went through one of those quicky college marriages. You know the kind. Lasted a year. Now she has a baby and lives with her mother. I mean, what chance does she have? Men her age want their own children, not somebody else's. You work for Miss Farrow today. Gregg Adams, her regular girl, is out sick. - Miss Farrow? - Her, you'll love her. Had 12 secretaries in three years... and she's close to a certain married vice president, if you know what I mean. - You approve? - Well, I don't know. I don't. Come on. Hi. I'm Brenda. You want your coffee in a paper container, or you want the jar? - You want the jar. - Fine. Thank you. - I want the container. - I know. I got you down. Watch her. She makes you pay for the jar... then she returns it and keeps the deposit money for herself. - Same thing with her teeth. - Her teeth? Mm. She's engaged, and she's having all her bad teeth pulled now... so her husband can pay for the new ones. Is everybody in the office engaged? I wouldn't know. I don't make it a habit to pry. This is Gregg's desk. You can use it today. Well, good luck. You want anything, just rattle your chains. Thanks. [Horn Blaring] Eddie, I wish you weren't going. The scholarship's only for a year. Then I'm coming back to marry you. Miss me a little? [Man] Visitors ashore, please. All visitors ashore. Visitors ashore, please. All visitors ashore. Visitors ashore, please. All visitors ashore. - Don't stop loving me, Caroline. - [Woman] Miss Bender. - Caroline. - Miss Bender. Miss Bender? - I am Amanda Farrow. - Miss Farrow, I'm so sorry. You may come into my office in a moment. I said in a moment. It'll be all right. I was frightened too my first day. It goes away. - Good morning, Mr. Carter. - Good morning, Barbara. Oh, Caroline. You can order me some coffee. Black, no sugar. - Yes, Miss Farrow. How do l... - Dial the operator, ask for the coffee shop. No, no, no, no. At your desk outside. Before you do that, would you straighten out the files? The T's have gotten all mixed up with the M's somehow. You can do that later. Open the mail first. It's in the box under your nose, dear. Caroline, I haven't finished my instructions yet. As I was saying, you open the mail. Anything that requires a personal reply goes here. Not here or here, but here. Do you understand? Good. That's something. Crank letters, you handle. I want to see everything you write before you send it out. - Everything clear? - I think so. - Then where's my coffee? - What? Where's my... You young college things are all alike. You think you can breeze in and become editors overnight. You think everything's so easy. No, I don't. I don't even think it's easy to be a good secretary. You don't? That's very bright of you. - It isn't. - Will that be all, Miss Farrow? For now. Black. No sugar. [Exhales] Good morning. I'm April Morrison. I know you think I'm terrible. Well, I do too. I didn't pull the plug out on the alarm. I mean, I set it, then I didn't pull it, so it didn't ring. Um, being late the first morning on the job, well, I could kill myself. - Oh, dear. - Aren't you Mary Agnes? No. She's over there. - You-You mean I wasted that whole speech? - Well, it was very good. Oh, dear. Here we go again. - I'm April Morrison. I know you think... - May I have the coffee shop? I didn't pull the plug out on the alarm. I mean, I set it... Hello, this is Miss Farrow's secretary. Would you send up coffee in a hurry, please? No, you don't have to fly it up, just bring it on a dead run. - [Buzzer Buzzes] - What? - No. Black, no sugar. - [Buzzing Continues] Caroline, when I buzz twice, it means I want you for dictation. Excuse me. I didn't know. Makes one wonder what they did teach you in college. Guess I forgot to take the course in buzzes. - Obviously, you've forgotten something else. - I beg your pardon? Your pad for dictation, unless, of course, you plan to memorize it. [Bell Tolling] [Miss Farrow] I want those rejects sent back today. - You have an hour for lunch. - Yes, Miss Farrow. - How did it go? - Swell. So, eat a soft lunch. And take your time. Farrow never gets back till 3:30. - She doesn't? - Of course not. She's an executive. - How does she get any work done? - Executives don't do the work. The higher up you get, the less you have to do. Until you're the top man, and then you have to make decisions, and that's hard. It's the ones just under the top who have the best deal. Funny about Farrow. She always wants somebody like you. You know, sophisticated. Down! Come on. Lots of room. - Well, so long. - Aren't you having lunch? I always have a sandwich with my boyfriend... at a mutually convenient place like Grand Central. While I'm working on the nightgown, he's saving up for the furniture. French Provencial. Both rooms. - Good. - See you later. Bye-bye. Sorry. - Nice footwork. - It's nothing. I do it all the time. - How did you make out with Mary Agnes? - She didn't believe a word. But she hired me anyway on account of my roommate Gregg is one of her regular secretaries. Only she isn't here today. May I have the sugar? - Are you a New Yorker? - No. You? Colorado. You mean it doesn't show? - Well, now that you mention it... - I know. But I'm gonna end up sophisticated if it kills me. Napkin. - Where are you from? - Wilton, Connecticut. - I commute every day. - Does it take long? Oh, long enough. I live there with my mother and father. I'd like to have an apartment here in town, but I'm afraid on my salary... Say, we could use a third girl in our place. - Gregg and I can barely swing rent, let alone buy clothes... - Got a dollar and a half... - for a cup of coffee, lady? - What happened to the three dollars you went off with? I had lunch at the zoo and fed it to the seals. One reminds me of my brother. - What are you hiding for? - In case Farrow the witch is around. Oh, well, I like risky living. I, uh, read some of your publicity this morning. I'm Caroline Bender. I think I'm filling in for you with the, uh, witch. - Miss Farrow? Lovely woman. - Oh, splendid. - She'll be glad to know you're well again. - Oh, but I'm not. My agent had the reading put off till tomorrow so I'd have more time to work up the scene. Gregg is a great actress. She's going to be in David Wilder Savage's new play. - Well, that's wonderful. - I'm only auditioning. Pay you back Thursday. I've only got 50 cents. I ate up the rest because I was hungry. - Would a dollar help? - Thanks. I'll charge us something for dinner atJoe's. - Bye, Caroline. See you in the snake pit. - Bye. May I have a hamburger and a glass of milk? - Everything okay, Colorado? - Lovely, thanks. We got to talking before you came. People here are so friendly. - Will you be needing your spoon? - Help yourself. - I'm sorry. - You're late. I know. But the elevator starter downstairs, it turns out he's from Nebraska... - which is right next door to Colorado... - You're working for Mr. Shalimar. - You mean now? - It's that large office with the closed door. Give the rest of the manuscript you're working on back to the filing clerk. I can't help you anymore today. - I'm working for Mr. Shalimar. - Well, we all have our troubles. - Excuse me, sir. - What? What? Who the hell are you? Come back here. Closer. - What's your name? - April Morrison. - New? - Yes, sir. And what makes you think that'd you'd make a good editor? - Pardon? - You read all the time, I suppose. - No, sir. - What? You don't read? Not much. It's not that I have anything against reading, I just never have the time. What are you doing at Fabian's if you don't read? - I need the money. - [Chuckles] Gene O'Neill would've liked that. I remember he used to say... Gene O'Neill? I've read him. They made us at school. You knew him? Eugene was one of my prot?g?s. Needed a lot of encouragement. But you don't seem old enough. I was a boy genius, Miss Morrison. - My. - Well, this is very pleasant, but we have work to do. - A great deal of work. Think you can manage? - I'll try. Good. This may go overtime, but if it runs any later than 6:00... - I'll give you money for dinner, all right? - Yes, sir. Fine. Let's get started. This is a memorandum to Stewart Fabian. Dear Stewart, the following is a planned schedule... of our forthcoming paperback books. Paperback books. Beginning in August... we will be ready with our new edition of, uh... Balzac's Droll Stories. Followed by, uh, Lawrence's Sons And Lovers... and Shakespeare's comedies. - [Bell Tolling] - [Chattering] - When you finish the slush pile... - Slush what? Unsolicited manuscripts, dear. Then you may go. - But I want my comments on each. - Typed? No, Miss Bender. Beat it out on a native drum. I merely meant that it is late. Oh. So it is. Well, there's no hurry. You can come early in the morning and finish them. - Or is that too difficult? - I don't know yet. Good night, Miss Farrow. Good night, Miss Bender. - Ready? - Just about. - Say, Mary Agnes? - Yeah? - Would it hurt if I took this home to read tonight? - You wanna read it? - On your own time? - Yeah. - Help yourself. - Good. - Now that you're a member of the clan, how do you like it? - Well, a little rough. - Now that you're a member of the clan, how do you like it? - Well, a little rough. Come in. And, uh, few people realize the great future that is waiting for paperback books. Thanks, Harold. Miss Morrison... how many copies would you think that the average hardcover book sells? - I don't know. - Maybe a hundred thousand, if it's a best seller. - That's not many, is it? - No, sir. Some towns don't have any library at all. Not even a bookshop. If people want to get a book, they have to go to a drugstore. - And what do they read? Our books. - My heavens. We're responsible for changing the literary taste of America. It's our books with our sexy covers, our low cost... and our mass distribution that are slowly converting America... to the delights of great literature. I could listen to you for hours. I don't blame you. So could I. But we'll take a break now. - You tired? - No. I feel wonderful. Good. Good. You are as intelligent as you are, uh, pretty. - Thank you. - I'll bet you have a lot of boyfriends. Not in New York. I don't even know any boys here. Back home I had a lot of dates, I guess. - Anyone special? - Oh, no. - What sort of man appeals to you? - An understanding man. Someone kind and intelligent. - I hope you find him. - Oh, me too. With your smile, when you do meet that boy, he won't have a chance. Oh, I wish I would meet him. I wish I were in love with someone who loved me. And what about fun? Wouldn't you like to meet someone that you could have a little fun with... - without necessarily being in love? - Yes. I guess so. - No, please. - Oh, go on. What sort of things do young boys say to young girls nowadays... when they want to, uh, make love? Say? Well, they don't say anything. They mostly just grab and breathe hard. - That must be very unpleasant. - It is. I just hate it. How do college boys make love? I'm not exactly an authority, Mr. Shalimar. Every girl is an authority on her own life. No wonder you're an editor. You know so much about people. Ah, that's because I ask. I question. I know what every woman in America wants to read because I talk to women... find out about their hopes, their dreams... their fears. - What are you thinking about? - I can't say. Mr. Shalimar! [Clears Throat] Come. It's not as bad as that, Miss Morrison. We'II, uh, finish the report in the morning. - What about your sandwich? - I'm not... I'm not hungry. Well, you will be later. Have mine too. And, uh, don't talk to any strange men on the way home. My father used to say that. Your father? Yes, well. Better take a cab. Hope you don't live in the Bronx. - Good night. - Good night, sir. [Typing] - Is Gregg here yet? - Her audition probably ran long. - Is Miss Farrow in? - Not yet. Don't worry. - Oh, I know. But Gregg's so unpredictable. - Take it easy. She'll get here. He doesn't, Vince. He really doesn't. Walter's one of the lucky ones. He only believes what he wants to believe. Oh, I should leave him, I suppose. But I need him. Isn't that funny? I need him, and all this time I thought it was he who needed me. What a joke. - And you... - Thank you very much, Miss... Adams. Would you like me to wait, Mr. Savage? We'll get in touch with your agent. - Really? - I promise. Ah, well, you won't. But thanks anyway. - Who's next, Charlie? - AliceJohnson, Mr. Savage. Taxi. Gregg, hurry. The witch is in. Shejust buzzed for you. - These are her phone messages. - I'm gonna be sick again this afternoon. Another audition? - Oh, there you are, Gregg. - Good morning, Miss Farrow. At 9:30, Mr. Rufus Smith called. "Have you read his novel?" - At 9:45, Mr. Griffen called... - What was your audition for this morning, Miss Adams? A new play or a soap commercial? At 10:15, Mr. Harry Miller called. "Can you meet him for lunch?" No. Tell him I'm sorry. [Bell Tolling] [Cash Register Dings] Caroline, come here. Caroline, Mike Rice. Mr. Shalimar, Caroline Bender. - How do you do? - Will you join us in a drink, Miss Bender? - Uh, coffee, please. - One coffee. Don't be uneasy, Miss Bender. We're quite informal at Fabian's. He's right, Caroline. And if something happens you don't expect... it's because everyone is so informal here, isn't it? Ah... Mm. - You don't need to be scared. - Do you get scared, Miss Bender? - Not easily, Mr. Rice. - I read your recommendation on that Wyle Prentice book. - Your instinct is sound. I'm giving that young writer an assignment. - I'm so pleased. How would you like me to give you a manuscript to read every night, hmm? Oh, that would be... marvelous. I like enthusiasm. It's the quality beyond price. That and experience. Are you looking for experience, Miss Bender? Of a sort, Mr. Shalimar. Heigh-ho, so it goes. But as my friend Eugene O'Neill used to say... "When you get older, you'll find that it's the things you didn't do... that cause you pain. ' Oh, well. When all else fails... there's always the 5:42 to Westport. Mike. Young ladies. Good night. - Good night. - Isn't he interesting? I don't understand one word he says. - Perhaps it's just as well. - Don't underestimate him, Miss Bender. Treat him with respect. It's tough being 55 and worried about... Iosing a job that's not even good enough for you to begin with. - Why should he lose his job? - You. Young people like you. Bright, young kids with drive and a flair. He's afraid. - Afraid of me? - Not as you are now, but as you'll be in a few years. He let me read your report. You've got an eye for this kind of work. - It's a gift. - Thank you. - Have a drink? - No, thanks. We're gonna go shopping. Oh, Caroline, instead of that, why don't you come have dinner with Gregg and me? She does... - I'd love to. - Okay, I'll call her. - Don't you get caught, Caroline. - Caught in what, Mr. Rice? In a bind, Caroline. Or in a bottle, Caroline. In Fabian's publishers of quality, Caroline. Get out quick. Work six months or a year. Prove whatever you have to prove. Then marry the med student or the law student and "love" happily ever after. - I plan to. - No business career? No fame? No fortune? - No. - No ambition? - None. - How wonderful. Gregg says fine. Come on. You too, Mr. Rice. Something tells me it's gonna get very drunk out tonight. I wouldn't wanna miss it. - Oh, please come. - No. - Good night. - Good night. - Won't you be Ionely? - Yes. - Good night. - Good night. Oh, it's all kind of magic... New York. I would like to live here forever, wouldn't you? Yes. I think if Eddie wanted to. - Eddie? Is that your boyfriend? - Yes. - What's he like? - Oh, he's about 10 feet tall. - A basketball player. - No. I just meant he's 10 feet tall to me. Actually, he's like any ordinary... divinely handsome, utterly irresistible young man. - It's wonderful to be in love, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - I'm in love too. - What's his name? I don't know. L- I haven't met him yet. Listen, I've got some things to pick up. He lets us charge. I like charge accounts better than money, don't you? [Chuckles] Of course. These days, who can afford money? Well, I don't know. If Eddie hasn't married me by the time I'm 26... I may take myself a lover. Really, at 26? I guess you're right. If you're that old, you have a right to live. If my mother heard me talk about love in such a casual way, I think she'd die. My mother never talked about love in any way. She'd no more tell me not to have an affair than-than she'd tell me not to steal a car. - She knows I wouldn't think of it. - But you do think of it. - I think about it all the time. - All I want is a man who will love me... for a little while. My mother was married three times. Each one I'd start calling him Dad. Then off he'd go. It was confusing at first, but then I began to look forward to the change. And now the only thing I want is to be free, to have no ties... to have and to hold and then let go. Here's to men. Bless their clean-cut faces and dirty little minds. [Together] Hear, hear. Now, Gregg. Caroline. We want you to move in with us. It's not just that we like you. We need your money. [Chuckles] Gee, I'd love to, but I don't know. My family might... - Would they mind? - No. No, I don't think they'd mind. Come on. I'll take you on the grand tour. Note the length of the cord. It's important when you have a private call. You just take yourself away from the rest of us. And here is your closet. - Oh, it's so small. - Ah, but that's the beauty of it. You won't have to buy a lot of clothes to fill it. And the master bedroom. Yours. It's got springs. - [Groans] It's got lumps. - Sleep around them. You get half a shelf in the bathroom... half a shelf in the kitchen, and half a shelf in the bookcase. All for your very own. What do you say? - Well, I don't know... - Good. It's settled. - And it's your turn to take out the garbage. - Oh, thanks. - Gregg, want me... - No. I'll do it. - [Rings] - It's her agent about the part maybe. Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. Who wanted it anyway? It's a very old broad who cuts herself up with a kitchen knife. I'll take it. [Door Closes] [Kitten Mewing] You know something, kitty? I wanted that part like hell. Fabian. Mr. Summers, Amanda Farrow speaking. It's about the Cassaro book. Yes, the author simply refuses to make the changes we asked for in the fifth chapter. Yes. Arthur, hi. No, nothing really, dear. I just wanted to hear your voice. It doesn't matter. Whatever you say is what I want to hear. I love you too. I missed you so much last night. I waited and waited, and then I suddenly realized that you must be tied up in a meeting. You were home? But last night was ours... She did the same thing last week. How many headaches can she have? Arthur, nobody knows better than I do that you're married. But one night a week is all we have. I don't care. I will not be taken for granted. Nor will I be a convenient diversion for you when you happen to be bored at home. Listen to me. I have one small corner of your life. I've never asked for more, and I will not settle for less. Now you and your rabbit-faced wife can both go to hell. I'd like you to type these before you leave, please. Oh, I'm working for Mr. Rice today. Today you work for Mr. Rice, tonight you work for me. Now you won't have to sneak home any more manuscripts. Oh, yes, I've heard all about it. Of course, we all know that tomorrow you will be a reader... and day after tomorrow an editor. In the meantime, you're still a typist. If I were you, Miss Bender, I'd do these. I'm presuming, of course, that you'd like to remain. - [Door Slams] - What was all that? She thinks I'm after her job. Tell her you're leaving to get married as soon as Eddie comes back. I did. She doesn't believe me. And I'm supposed to go out to dinner tonight. Mike Rice? No. I have a blind date. Paul Landis. - His mother and mine grew up together. - One of those. Well, let's not knock it. It's a free dinner. [Sighs] - Good night. - Good night. [Ringing] Hello? London? Ye-Yes, this is she. - Hello? Caroline? - Eddie? Eddie. Hey. I've been tracking you all over New York City. How are you? I'm fine. When are you coming home? Caroline, that's what I'm calling about. Oh, darling, I've missed you so. - [Vacuum Whirring] - [Eddie, Indistinct] - You what? - I said I tried to write you. - Caroline, do you remember Helen Lowe? - Who? Helen Lowe. Her father owns oil wells in Dallas. - [Vacuum Continues] - Eddie, I can't hear you. Talk slower. What did you say? I said Helen Lowe. Her parents were on the same ship with me. - Joe? - What? - More trash. - Hey, please! - And you were what? - I said we were... - [Woman] So why not this one? - Eddie, I can't hear you. I said Helen and I were married... this morning. Caroline? Caroline? [Shaky Voice] Hello? Hello? Are you there? [No Audible Dialogue] Miss Bender? Are you Caroline Bender? - What? - I'm Paul Landis. I was waiting downstairs. We have a dinner date. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, of course. [Chattering] Since you're interested in books, you should be very interested... in hearing about some of the tax problems we handle. It'd make a great novel. Don't you, uh, like your brandy? What? Oh, yes. Maybe I've been lucky. I've always had enough money, got into the schools of my choice. I've never even had any illnesses, other than measles and chicken pox. Oh, I broke my leg once. But that wasn't so bad after all... because I had a chance to lie in bed and read things. I read things I never would've had time to otherwise. - Who's that? - That's a friend. He's coming over. Caroline seems to have forgotten her manners. I'm Mike Rice. - Paul Landis. - Can I buy you two a drink? No, thanks. I have an early appointment in the morning. - Waiter. Check, please. - Please, don't go away, Mike. - Are you coming, Caroline? - Paul, I'm sorry. I can't. Good night, Caroline. I won't bother you again. - Paul, it's not you. There's nothing wrong with you. - I know. - Oh, Mike. - Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Mike, how do you stop loving somebody when they've stopped loving you? [Soft Whistle] The fella you were engaged to? Well, this calls for old Dr. Mike's favorite prescription. Two scotches, straight. - Mike, will you stay with me? - Sure. We can barhop the whole town if you want. No. I mean, I don't wanna be alone. Please take me home with you. Make those doubles. Oh, this is a lovely place you have here. This is where I come when the bars close. Would you like a drink? Shall I tell you more about the Paul Landises of the world? - [Laughing] - Paul Landis is dependable, and he's steady. Eddie isn't steady. Eddie isn't ready to be steady. - Steady Eddie isn't ready to be steady - Come on. Stay with Landis. Go and sit down. Come on. Have a drink. What else is he? Paul Landis is gracious living. - Shall I tell you what else? - By all means. He's exactly what every girl wants to marry. Exactly... what you'd love to marry... if only you could stand him. Well, hallelujah. We'll scratch him off the list. Scratch him off the list. Now we come to the world of Eddie Harrises... Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Switch back to Landis. Switch back to... - Did I call Gregg and April from the bar? - Uh-huh. - What did I say? - You told them you were going home to Connecticut. - Did they believe me? - I don't know about that. - Of course they believed me. They're my friends. - Sure they are. - Did I ever tell you about Eddie? - Oh, many times. Her father owns oil wells. Not much you can say against an oil well, is there? [Laughing] No, there isn't. Come on. Take a drink. [Laughing] - Why did he do it to me, Mike? - Caroline. I feel so undone. I don't know where to go, and I don't know what to do. Come on. It's all right now. It's all right. Hold me, Mike. Oh, please, make love to me, even if you don't love me. - Caroline. - Twenty-six is too far ahead. - Please love me. - Be still, now. Be still. It wasn't his fault. She trapped him. Oh, no. You fell in love with the wrong guy. That's okay, but don't give yourself wrong reasons why it didn't work out, huh? All right. Just... love me. [Liquid Pouring] - [Sighs] - [Clears Throat] Oh, Mike. Why didn't you wake me? I left early. I wanted to walk. - You walked? - Most of the night. I do it sometimes. Well, before you walked, did anything unusual happen? - I wouldn't say unusual, but... interesting. - Oh, dear. Honey, nothing happened. Oh! Mike, is this the way you feel every morning? Only until the first drink. But for beginners, Dr. Mike recommends aspirin. Oh, no. This is my first hangover, and I'm gonna keep it. Besides, it's keeping my mind off my troubles. - Oh! - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. - It was my fault. I didn't look. - Did I hurt you? No, it's just that... Mrs. Thompson isn't here today, and Mr. Bossart asked me... - to show you the roughs for the Easter edition. - Barbara. - It's so long since we talked. - They want you to decide between these two. Except for the office, I haven't seen you for three months. Which do you like better? I don't know. Which do you? This one, I think. It's clearer. - More arresting somehow. - How's your baby? The baby's fine. How's your wife? Fine too. She's in Nantucket for the summer. Have dinner with me, Barbara. No. I'm the girl who wants to get married again, remember? The girl for whom an affair with a married man just isn't enough. One more evening. Just dinner. Why, Sidney? Because your wife's gone away for the summer? No. You know that's not why. Shall I tell them this one? [Sighs] Yes, all right. - Barbara... - I'm sorry. They're waiting. It hasn't been three months. It's been three months, one week, four days. Honey, you haven't got a hangover. You were home with your family last night. - You're right. - Caroline, Mr. Shalimar wants to see you right away. Oh, what did I do now? I don't know, but you'd better hurry. Ah, Miss Bender. I've just been talking with, uh, Miss Farrow. You are no longer a typist here. - Well, I've worked very hard, and... - You are now a reader. - I'm a what? - A reader. You'll get a raise. I fought for you upstairs and managed to get you $20 more. - Twenty dollars more a week? - No, not a week. A month. Oh, perhaps it isn't very much, but think of the honor. Oh, yes. Yes, it is an honor, and... Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Shalimar. Just do your reading, Miss Bender, days, nights, weekends. - Yes, I will. - That's all I ask. Oh, I will. I'll work hard, Mr. Shalimar. I'm a reader. I've been looking for you. I'd like these out by noon. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Farrow. I can't. Mr. Shalimar has just made me a reader. - So he did it, did he? - Yes. As a matter of fact, he said he'd been talking to you. I don't know how to thank you. I told Mr. Shalimar that you were not qualified, Miss Bender. You're too soft. I don't think you could stand up to a writer and say... "Your work is no good." I don't think you have the guts. - Thank you for your confidence in me. - I call them as I see them. I'm beginning to think you're right not to like me, Miss Farrow. Miss Adams, on your way to my apartment tonight... will you pick up four dozen cocktail napkins for the party? And I'd like these by noon. April, Miss Farrow says please see that these are typed by noon. Hey, Nancy, Miss Farrow said please see that these are typed by noon. Julie? Miss Farrow said to have these typed by noon. It was a very successful party. Nobody wanted to go home. I did. I thought it would be helpful if you met David Wilder Savage casually. He's about to direct a new play. Sorry he couldn't come. Oh, that's all right. I guess I always expect too much anyway. Clear up the rest of those things, and then you can go home. - [Doorbell Buzzing] - Whoever it is, they're too late. - You're too late. - Hey, hey! Sorry. The party's over. - Then what are you doing here? - I'm the maid. - Oh. - [Farrow] Who is it? - Who are you? - I'm David Savage. - He's somebody called David Savage. - Oh, David. Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich? Milk, coffee or both? - Sandwich. - Meanwhile, Gregg can fix you a drink. - Good. - Help yourself. But, uh, if you're the maid, uh... - Oh, being the maid isn't my real work. - Oh. - It's more of a hobby. - I see. And, uh, what is your real work? Are you an actress? Not at all. I'm a vivisectionist. Only I believe in cutting up people to save animals. You do? So do I. - What-What is your name? - Gregg Adams. - Well, Gregg, let's go. - I should help Miss Farrow. Now, if I know Amanda Farrow... you've been working your head off all evening and not been paid. Oh, no. I've been paid. You have? - I stole two bottles of scotch. - Good. Just a second, David. - We've just time to escape. - She'll be furious. Amanda's always furious. That's her trademark. [Mouthing Words] David, how wonderful of you to come. Now I won't have to be alone. You see, I lied. I am an actress. As a matter of fact, I read for you some weeks ago. - I don't remember. - I was auditioning you for the part of a director. You were? How did I do? You were a flop. - Where are we going? - To my apartment. - All right. - It's in here. He's fine. He's a fine performer, butjust not good enough, that's all. I'm sorry, Leland. I've tried everything. No, the boy hasn't got it. I'll have to replace him. No. No, I'll tell him myself. Yeah. All right. Thanks for calling. Bye. - Now, where were we? - I hoped you'd remember. Have you really read all those books? At least twice. - And those magazines? And all those scripts? - In my profession... an insatiable appetite is standard equipment. I'm always looking for something new and exciting. This room... You must have the entire history of the theater right here. I'm delighted you like my apartment. I'd like you to stay. - And if I said no? - I'll take you down and help you find a cab. Gregg. Act one, scene one. [Women Singing] - [Stops] - Cha-cha-cha! [Women Laughing] This is going to be fun. Don't you think? I'd rather be shot. Wait! - Oh! - Gregg, are you all right? I'll be all right as soon as I quit this job. All I need is a little sleep. - Have you told Farrow you're leaving yet? - No. I'll do that tomorrow, I think. I wonder if there's a phone. - I want to call David. - Oh, you just left him. That was an hour ago. - Ow! - Gregg, be careful. [Metal Clanging] Chow time.! Come and get it, kiddies! [Gasps] Sidney! I never expected to find you here. - Hello, Mrs. Lemont. - Hello. Ruth called from the island this morning. She tells me that... you and your wife are coming over to Sconset to have dinner with us Saturday. Well, I hadn't planned on going to the island this weekend. Oh, nonsense. Do you good. You're looking tired. - Don't you think he's looking tired, Mrs. Lemont? - I'm sorry. L... Barbara... You know, somebody was telling me a story the other day... about her and some married chap. - Oh, my dear fellow. - It's all right. Uh, look, let me buy you a drink, eh? Thanks. Some other time. [Cheering, Shouting] It won't work, Caroline. You can't get as many 50-cent books on a drugstore rack as you can the 35's. - You wouldn't need as many. - She has a point. - And if you give them a best seller... - Unabridged, and cheap. - Oh! - You have a ready-made market. - All right, honey, that's enough. - Well, your costs would be less and your profits greater. You'd lead the whole field of paperbacks. You know, there just may be something to what she says. Hello, Mr. Shalimar. How are you, you old futz? - Mike, really, where are you taking me? - The other side of the moon. Whether you think so or not, that happened to be an important discussion. - Caroline, I need your help. - What's the matter? - I've got to find something. Will you help me? - Sure. - What are you looking for? - A lost friend. Shall I tell you how I see my friend? I see her as a little girl sitting on a rock in a glade. Along comes a pied piper. And while other little girls dance along after him... to the land of marriage and respectability... this little girl doesn't move a muscle. She's no fool, that little girl. No, she stays perched on that rock saying... "What will become of me? What will become of me?" - Only she doesn't dare to find out. - I don't see it that way. I think now she knows what will become of her, and she's on her way. - On her way to what? Amanda Farrow's job? - Maybe. - Anything wrong with that? - Not a thing. That is, if you want to become a ruthless, driving, calculating woman. I'm interested in my work. I want to do better. Honey, you don't give a damn about your work. All you care about is your own hot-eyed ambition. So, you're going to pull the rug from under Farrow. How do you know? I might be better at her job than she is. You wouldn't be better, just younger. You'll outlast her. Next, you'll go after Shalimar's job. Do me a favor, will you? When you take over the presidency, don't redecorate my office. - I like it the way it is. - I'll take it up with the board of directors. Caroline, do you know why you're doing all this? Probably because I like grinding the faces of the poor. It's because a man you thought loved you really loved somebody else. Mike! When you tried to forget with the first guy at hand, you passed out instead. - Would you please stop? - And now, you've closed the door. - Being a woman is too painful, so you're not gonna be one. - Will you let me go? Men aren't lovers. They're competition. So let's not join 'em. - Let's lick 'em! - What the hell is it to you, anyway? - Nothin'. Forget it. - The only trouble with you is you got too far away from a bar. Well, you can be damn sure I'm not gonna make that mistake again. You certainly picked a fine way to get back a lost friend! [Piano] [Continues] Didn't your department get Friday's memo from Mr. Fabian? It said positively the clubhouse is off-limits. And you snitched a soda. Well, I will too. Didn't you find the chicken excruciatingly salty? - You think they'll kill us? - Kill us? With ginger ale? Did you bang your head or something? Of course not. What department you in... advertising or circulation? - Neither. - You know what's always been my secret ambition? - What? - To pour a little out of every bottle at a bar and drink it. - What do you suppose would happen? - Let's find out. Oh, good! - You start from that end. - We couldn't. We couldn't. Honey, that expression just isn't used in my company. - What's your name? - Dexter Key. I'm April Morrison. I'm on the 37 th floor. Where do you work? Me? I play the market. Stocks, bonds. - You're a member here? - One hundred percent proof. And that car outside... is that yours? - You're so pretty. - Are you going to report me? Of course not. I'm glad we met. Well, we've done it, Professor. - Down the hatch. - You first. Uh-uh. "Guests not permitted to drink in tennis clothes." Throw it out before it explodes. Oh, John? Who'd you say you worked for? I didn't, but his name's Mr. Shalimar. This is for Mr. Shalimar of the Fabian hierarchy. - Tell him compliments of the club. - Yes, sir, Mr. Key. Poor Mr. Shalimar. - What did you do that for? - Just... tinkering. Are you always so impulsive? Show me a girl, I'll show you an impulse. Are you coming? - Where? - Back to New York. I'll drive you. - But l... - Then you won't have to take the bus home. - We'll have a night on the town. - That would be wonderful, except that I'm not... Let's not worry about what we're wearing. We'll play it by ear. - But l... - You talk too much. Talk too... Hey, wait for me! Your resignation is accepted, Miss Adams. You're free. Unleashed. I suppose now you'll become the toast of Broadway. - Thank you, but I doubt that. - You're being very modest. - No. It's a very small part. - Really? I thought David only played around with leading ladies. - Perhaps he's changed his way of playing. - Oh, Gregg, you're such a fool. There isn't a woman around who doesn't know about David Wilder Savage. - Know what? - Simply this. That he casts the women in his life the same as he does in his plays... according to his moods. An ingenue last week. A pushover this week. No offense. - And who knows what next week? - I'm in love with him. - He'll never marry you. - Are you putting me up for your club, Miss Farrow? Gregg, I've had more experience than you. And for experience to be of value, somehow someone must learn by it. You're a very reckless girl. But to fall in love with a man like David isn't reckless. It's disastrous. You know, Miss Farrow... you remind me of something somebody once said about love. Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. [Knocking] Oh, Gregg, I forgot to tell you about the shower for Mary Agnes. Miss Farrow, we're having a bridal shower for Mary Agnes. We thought we'd give her a baby bottle or a "How To" book, or things like that. Oh, shut up. Shut up! - Here he is, everybody. - [Women Gasping, Squealing] This is Bill. Didn't I tell you he was cute? You don't have confidence to go through life looking intelligent. A husband she loves, a budget she'll balance to the penny, and babies. She is smarter than any of you. - Here, young lady, you need a drink. - Ginger ale, please. Oh, nonsense. This is a celebration. You can't possibly want ginger... Yes, you do. - I don't see how... - Ooh! Come on, you two. Let's lively it up a little. Have a drink. Sidney! What's the matter, boy? You look Ionely. Let's find you... Ah! Here. You talk to her, but take it easy. Isn't this a wonderful party? I love showers, don't you? - Have you congratulated them yet? - Well, they look pretty busy right now. Oh, you mustn't hold back. This is their day. I hope you both will be very happy. Oh, we're gonna be happy forever, thank you. We don't approve of people who give up on their marriages. - Oh, gosh, Mrs. Lemont. I didn't mean... - That's all right, Mary Agnes. I don't much approve of those people either. Mary Agnes, I just wanted to say, could I try on your ring? Sure. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. - [Sidney] Congratulations. - Did you all get your invitations yet? They're engraved. You can feel how it's raised with your finger. - Did you get yours, Mr. Carter? - [Door Closes] - Mr. Carter? - Mr. Carter? What? Oh, yes. We ordered champagne, and we're having a photographer to take movies... - Pictures. - And a wedding cake with a bride and groom on top. [Barbara Screams] Stop it.! You dirty, horrible man. - You're disgusting! - Oh, what's the matter with you? You've been around. You know what the score is. Who do you think you're fooling, Mrs. Lemont? Come on, Fred. Let's take a little walk. Does she think she's fooling somebody or something? She's been around. She knows when a man wants a little fun. All a man wants is a little fun. Just-Just once in a while. You know, Bernard Shaw was right. Youth is such a wonderful thing. - What a pity it's wasted on the young. - [Laughter] [SoftJazz] - We have to stop. - Why? We just have to. Can't you change the record or something? I like its message. No, you mustn't. No, no, no. Is that all they taught you in school? They give a course in "yes," you know. Look, April, how much longer do you think I can keep storming the citadel? Oh, Dexter, the way you talk. The way I talk, the way I act. You don't like anything about me, do you? - I love you. - Then show it. - I do. - Not the way it counts. Dexter, I can't help the way I am. Oh, please. I was having such a wonderful time. Well, spread it around. - Look, come on, April. I'll take you home. - Dexter. Would you ever marry a girl who... wasn't pure? If I cared for her... and wanted to be with her the rest of my life, then nothing would matter. Dexter, I love you so much. - Do you love me? - Of course I do. Believe me, baby, I have nothing but respect for you. [Applause] That does it. Lock it up. - Seven calls. Not bad, huh? - Don't get excited. It's only Boston. It won't mean a thing in New York. Okay, strike the set and start loading. How'd it look out front? Great. Great. But what happened to the kids? They should have been on and off in two minutes. Miss Adams went up on her lines again. The kids had to bail her out. Dave, she's had a week in New Haven, two weeks here. - The opening's next Thursday. - I know, I know. Okay, it's a small part. It won't hurt the play. With any other director, that'd be good enough. - I'll talk to her. - Fine. Anything else? Yeah. CallJudy Masson in New York and tell her to get up in the part. David, I got it. I finally got my laugh in the first act. Uh, let's go outside a minute. Gregg, I'm replacing you in the show. I'm sorry. I want you to understand, you're not bad in the part. You're too young for it, too beautiful. I should have told you before, but I kept hoping... - That I'd become older? Uglier? - Now, Gregg... Give me another chance, David. I can do better. Please. It's not a question of another chance. The part calls for a sophisticated woman, gay, carefree. - I'm like that. - No. No, you're not. Not anymore. If you'd give me extra rehearsal, if you'd work with me... Dave.! The New York Times is on the phone. They hear we're coming in with a smash. I think you'd better talk to them. Right away. You know, I'm-I'm sorry, Gregg... but rehearsing won't help. You're... You're too anxious in the part, too possessive. This is a woman who loves deeply, but always with a light touch. When the time comes, she gives it up gracefully. She knows how to have... To have and to hold, and then let go. - Exactly. - But I can do that, David. Can you, Gregg? Then let go now. - David... - All right, Gregg, we'll talk about it later. - Hmm? - Let me stay on with the show, David. I'll do anything. I'll be an understudy. Just let me stay with you. All right. Charlie? - Charlie? - Yes, David? Put Miss Adams on the books as understudy. Right. Thank you, David. It's all right. [Woman] I'm simplyjust dying to get back to New York for it. - Looks like we have one. - I can hardly wait. Excuse me, Miss Adams. - I wish you'd come in with me. - Baby, I hate weddings. - Where are you going? - Back to the apartment. - Your family's apartment? - Mine. - Come with me. - Mary Agnes would never forgive me. I missed the wedding. I don't dare miss the reception. Hurry home, baby. Hurry home. - [Piano] - [Laughing, Chattering] Zach.! - [Stops] - She's coming... Mary Agnes! - ['The Wedding March'] - Ready, girls? It's for you, honey! - What's the matter? - I feel dizzy. Come on. We'll go out the back. - Does Dexter know? - No, but I wanna go to him now. - Well, we'll take you. - No, please. I'd rather go alone. All set? - You sure you don't want us to come with you? - I'm just fine. Good-bye. Mike. - Take care. - 56th and Sutton Place, please. And be careful of the bumps. Well, what would you like to do? Go to a movie? Eat a steak? Shoot yourself? More than anything in the world... I'd like, right this minute... to cook you the biggest, the heaviest... the most indigestible meal you ever ate. So all this old-fashioned happy stuff got to you, did it? Be careful. You're slipping off that rock. I know, right into a homemade apple pie. - More coffee? - Yes, please. - Oh, Mike. - Out of the deep freeze into the fire. In one jump. - You know, all these months, I've wanted to kiss you. - Why didn't you? - You're too young. - For kissing? Too young to settle for someone like me. You still care about things. You should love a man who is as capable of surprise and hope as you are. Poor Mike. So old, he knows all the answers. Old has got nothing to do with knowing the answers. Old is when you don't even bother with the questions. - Oh, Mike, that's so corrupt. - Exactly my point. Well, it's mine too. If you're gonna corrupt me... you might as well do it by kissing me. - Mike, may I ask you something? - Go ahead. Were you ever married? Almost once. Is that why you drink so much... because of her? Oh, you've been listening to the Mary Agneses. [Sighs] What was she like? - Your girl. - I don't know. That was only at first. Now, when I look at you, I see only you. Do you know that's the first, unguarded, young thing you've ever said to me? [Phone Ringing] - Don't go away. - I'm right here. Hello? Dallas? Yes, this is Caroline Bender. Eddie? Are you all right? Is everything all right? You're coming here for some meetings? What do you mean, "for old time's sake"? What was so hot about old times? Never mind. Yes, I'll see you for lunch. Sure. I wouldn't miss it. Good-bye. - [Door Opens] - Mike. - I'll see you around. - Where are you going? Honey, you're still hooked. Oh, Mike. [Woman] This is the fifth time we've met like this. And do you know what? - [David] What? - You never once said you loved me. I love you. I love you... approximately. - What does that mean? - Approximate means... in the area of, near, close together. - Meaning you don't actually love me? - Of course I do, darling. But not in the way you want. I'm just not a... a forever type. That's the quality I mean. I want you to toss the lines like Ping-Pong balls. You're fed up with this girl. You're reaching for your hat with every word. See? Noises. You're just making noises because you want out. That's all. You want out. - Don't play it as if you were enjoying the scene, right? - Right. - Try again. - David? This is the fifth time we've met like this, and do you know what? - What? - You never once told me you loved me. - David! - Gregg, will you please shut up? I just wanted to know about dinner... if you want me to cook. No. No, I'll get something at Sardi's. That's right. That's what I want. Now, Judy, you're doing beautifully, honey... but the audience has paid $8.80 to see your lovely face. So let them see it, hmm? This girl is going to be even better than I thought. - Now, kids, when she's... - I'm going now, David. - I'll see you later, darling. - No, no, you won't, darling. I'm busy tonight. All right. Let's run it again. From the top this time. David? David? - Who is it? - It's me, Gregg. I brought you your laundry. I thought you were going out. I am. Look, Gregg, I'll be through here in 10 minutes. That's the trouble with spying. You can never ask for an explanation of what you find out. - What are you doing here? - Playing at being a spy. Playing Gregg. - David, are you crazy? Please, stop! - I'm making it easier for you. - You can look at everything. Everything! - Please, stop! - Would you like me to clean out the closet? - I wasn't spying. I was trying to do something for you... to make things neater, to help you. Really? Now, why didn't I see that? And all this time, I thought you were going through my personal belongings... in order to feed your possessive, neurotic, suffocating... - Don't talk to me like that! - I'm trying to show you what a heel I am. Here you're doing things for me, trying to help me... and I react like an ungrateful dog. Gregg... Gregg, I don't deserve you. - David... - So I want you to go now. And leave my key. - Your key? - Yes, my spare key. - The one you stole. - I stole your key? But I didn't. I wouldn't do a thing like that. I wouldn't, and I didn't. David. - I want you to go now, like a big girl. - Oh, no, don't! Oh, David, please! I'll never do it again! I swear! I promise! David, don't! Please, don't throw me out! Don't throw me out. [Sobbing] You're all I have. Oh, please. - I didn't want to be like this. - No, I know you didn't. - Don't be mad at me. Don't hate me. - I'm not mad at you. And I don't hate you. I just don't feel anything about you now, except tired. - So, please go. - You're tired. That's it. You've been working too hard. A good night's sleep is all you need. - Gregg... - You're just tired now, David. You rest. Everything will be all right tomorrow. You'll see. Gregg, end of act three. End of play. Kiss me. Good night, Gregg. You're just tired now. [Honks Horn] - Two minutes, bride beautiful. - [April] Dexter here? Just drove up. - How do I look? - Oh, lovely. Oh, I'm so scared. Oh, I wish Gregg were here. I do too. She hasn't called since yesterday. - She usually calls in, at least. - [Knocking] - The bridegroom cometh. - [Horn Honking] - Hello, honey. - All set? - Oh. - Congratulations, Dexter. - Don't be angry. - She had to tell somebody. - Do you have time for a toast? - No, thanks, Caroline. - April, we'd better get going. - You don't need an old rice thrower, do you? That's nice of you, Caroline, but everything's all set. - Ready, darling? - My suitcase is there. Right. - Good-bye, Caroline. - [Caroline] Good luck. Oh, Caroline, I feel so strange. L... I feel like... Well, I don't know. Like something's missing. You and Dexter, you're together. That's all you need. Now, you go out there and you be the happiest bride God ever made. Oh, Dexter. I'm glad I told Caroline about us. It's not the sad things you need a friend to talk to about. It's the happy things. - Are you sure we're going the right way? - The anchor's up. No turning back now. - You want a drink, darling? - No. Maybe the minister won't like it. Put this on, darling, It'll save a lot of questions. Hey, aren't you rushing things a little? April, when are you going to grow up? - Now, put this ring on. - I don't understand. What did I say? Look at me, Dexter. Aren't we going to Maryland to be married? - No. - Why not? - Because I'm taking you to a doctor. - A doctor? April, what else can we do? - We can be married. - How can we get married? Do you wanna print a banner and run it up a flagpole? "Shotgun wedding"? What do you wanna do, tell everyone to send the kid's birthday present... six months late for the rest of his life? I won't have an operation. I want this baby. - You'll have other babies. - I'll die. You won't even feel sick. It's very clean, like a doctor's office. I'll take you there, and I'll be there with you. How do you know so much about places like that? Oh, April, word gets around. Did... Did you ever make a girl pregnant before? Not that I know of. You mean, some girls became pregnant and didn't even tell you? - Some girls don't. - But how could they not tell you? Maybe because they think I wouldn't believe it was mine. But you know this one is yours, don't you? Yes. Dexter, don't you love me at all? If you must know, I never really thought about it. - I'm not going. Let me out. - Are you crazy? - We're in the middle of the park. - I don't care! It's my baby, and I want it! - Let me out! - April! - [Horns Honking] - [Tires Screeching] - [Indistinct Chattering] - What happened? My-My baby? - May I tell her? - Yes. April... I'm sorry. Well, it isn't as if... as if I knew her. Wh-Where's Dexter? April, do you want to see him? No. I'm so ashamed. Honey, you loved him. Not anymore. Oh, Caroline, I'm... Now I'm just somebody who's had an affair. This should cover it. If there's anything left over, please leave it for Miss Morrison. Is she going to be all right? - What about the baby? - You don't have to worry, Dexter. She lost your baby. L- I have to be out of town for a few weeks. I'll call April when I get back. I think for her comfort, it would be better if I didn't see her now. Unless you think I should see her. I mean, if you think it would help her. Help her? What did you do when she needed help? Okay, I know what I am. But I wasn't gonna be forced into something I didn't want. Miss Bender. Your office called. Mr. Shalimar would like to see you immediately. Thank you. Miss Farrow resigning? L- I can't believe it. Why? Oh, she prefers to tell you herself. And, frankly, I can't believe it either. But, as of now, you're an editor. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - But... - Oh, yes, yes, yes. You'll get a raise. Of course, not as much as Miss Farrow. Oh, I fought for you upstairs. But I don't think you should consider the money, Miss Bender. - You should consider the... - Consider the honor. Well, now that you're a fellow executive, I think you ought to buy me a drink. - Caroline? - I'd love to, Fred. And, uh, feel free to lean on me at any time day or night. Hmm. - Brenda, I'm an editor. - That's great, honey. - I'm an editor! - Oh, Caroline! Good luck! [Farrow] Come in. - I've been expecting you. - I just heard you were leaving. Yes. Take a look at the nuggets of my 11 Fabian years. One glove, missing a mate. My first Christmas party here. The unfinished novel that I started. Why do you want this job? Because this is what I went to college for. This is what I worked for. - It means everything to me. - You're welcome to it. I've had it. You know what I'm quitting this mountain peak for? A widower in Illinois with two kids... and a factory that turns out jet equipment. Fifteen years ago he proposed to me, and I turned him down. Too plain, too small-town. I met him again about three weeks ago. He still talks with a twang, and his suits still don't fit. But he treats me as if he believes I'm the gentlest, softest woman in the world. And maybe, with enough time and tenderness... if it's not too late... maybe I can get to believe it myself. I wish you every happiness. Thank you. I appreciate that. And the same to you. - Oh, don't worry about me. - But I will. I'm going to worry about you very much. [Door Opens] I just heard the news. Congratulations. - Oh, Mike, isn't it wonderful? - It's great. You have everything you want now, haven't you? Miss Farrow's job, Miss Farrow's office. And in another month or so, you'll have the rest of Miss Farrow's life. - What do you mean? - Isn't that when your married boyfriend comes to town? - Mike... - Happy days, honey. Remind me to drink to your success sometime. [Clattering] [Caroline] Gregg, coffee's ready. - [Knocking] - Gregg, are you up? Breakfast is ready. I'm starved. Be right out. Aha. More subway daisies. - Ronnie's coming to breakfast again. - He just called. He's been on duty all night. He's had two broken legs... three babies and one psychopathic. - Now, don't get carried away, April. - Oh, no. Ronnie's different. Imagine finding somebody who knows all about you. Somebody who knows you as you really are... and likes you anyway. Well, that's it exactly. No wonder David Savage loves you. - You're so smart. - One egg or two, Gregg? - None. I'm not hungry. - You just said you were starving. - I did? - [Knocking] Caroline, if you ever have a free minute, I'd like to talk to you. Fine. I'm free right now. Oh, it's not that urgent. I just meant sometime. Well, what about lunch? Or dinner? I may be tied up. I'll call you. Hi, Doc. - Gregg, if you'd just wait a second... - I can't. I'm late now. - Where you going? - Oh, someplace. - Morning, Caroline. - Hi, Ronnie. - More samples? - A whole new batch. Here's a pill for stomachaches, colds and corns. This one cures measles, mumps and tired eyes. This little pill is a homesick pill. And here's a pill for which there is no sickness. - Got anything for an old-fashioned headache? - Of course not. - Bye-bye. - And this is for you. - Three more of my socks with holes. - Yes, Doctor. Coffee? I respect your judgment, Caroline, but you're forgetting popular taste. You're paying me for my opinion as an editor. Well, I'm giving it to you. The book is no good. The writing's inferior. The author doesn't believe a word he's written, and nobody else will either. - I didn't think it was that bad. - Oh, no? You publish this, and you won't even get back your printing costs. - Eddie. - Hello, Caroline. What are you doing here? I'm here on business... alone. - [Knocking] - Caroline, how about some... Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. - This is Mr. Harris. Mr. Rice. - How are you? - How do you do? - Mr. Harris is an old friend. Yes, l-I remember. - Did you want something, Mike? - It's nothing important. Some other time. - Oh, Caroline, I must talk to you. - Not now. Later. - Good friends. - Definitely. - You used to love champagne. - Oh! I'm tired of it. What's wrong? I buy you the most expensive lunch at 21, you don't want it. A corsage... you don't want it. Your favorite perfume... you don't want it. - What do you want? - Why didn't you bring me an oil well? I didn't wanna show off. - You're not impressed by any of it, are you? - No. - Then why did you come? - Just to show you how unimpressed I was. Well, I was impressed by this kind of thing. When we were in school, half the time I couldn't even afford to buy you a hamburger. Oh, come on, Eddie. What do you want from me? Sympathy? All right, what does that prove? At least there's one thing you're not tired of. That's contemptible. That isn't what you said that night at Cape Cod. That night, you said I was the only man... you would ever let make love to you. Remember? I remember. I remember all of it. Caroline? I never could admit it when I'd made a mistake, could I? Well, I'm admitting it now. I've never stopped loving you. - I adore you. - Oh, Eddie. I thought I was free of you. - Miss Farrow's back. - She is? - You don't suppose they'll take Caroline's job away, do you? - Hey, what's happening? - He's gonna do it. He's gonna do it. - Do what? I'll be right back, Amanda. Oh, Mr. Shalimar, I could just die. I expected a little more dignity from you, Brenda. Yes, sir. Have you got a minute? I'd like to have a word with you. Sit down, Fred. Caroline, l... I'm a bit worried about you. I think you've been, uh, working too hard... and I was wondering if there wasn't some way in which I could make things... well, a little easier for you. It's all right, Fred. Amanda Farrow may have her job back. How the devil did you know? - The grapevine. - You don't mind? - Not a bit. - Of course, you'll keep your own writers. Oh, of course. - You don't mind if I tell her? - Hmm? - Hello, Amanda. - Hi, Caroline. - I'm glad you're back. - Thank you. I hear you're doing a fine job. I knew you would. - Did Fred tell you... - Yes. It's all right. - I suddenly find I have other plans. - How is Mike? Mike? I wouldn't know. You'll want your old office back. You know, I never really belonged in it anyway. Thank you. It was too late for me. A Ionely man, two children. They needed too much, and I found I had nothing to give. Nothing. I'd forgotten how. Well, you're just in time. One of your old writers. Not another one of his lousy Westerns. [Shalimar, Clearing Throat] - Thank you, Caroline. - Thank you. Well, Amanda, we've missed you. It's so good to be back. Are you still pinching all the girls? Well, of course I'm still pinching all the girls. You don't imagine I'm interested in their minds, do you? I like you, Amanda. Have dinner with me tonight? - Promise no pinching? - I promise nothing. And, uh, just so that you'll feel completely at home... do remember that I'm a married man. Of course you are. What a darling you are to remind me. I'd love to dine with you. Seven? Seven. Caroline? Are you home? Caroline? April? Anybody? - [Clattering] - Caroline? Is that you? Caroline? April? Anybody? Anybody? [SoftJazz] Eddie, what about your wife? - What about her? - Well, she's gonna be hurt. - How can she be hurt? - She's gonna lose you. She never had me, not the way you have me. No, I mean, when you tell her about us, when you ask for a divorce. - When you and I get married. - Caroline, I've worked something out for us. - I had a talk with Jim last night. - Jim? My father-in-law. Helen's father. He's, uh... He's agreed I should open an office here, closer to the oil companies. I'll have an apartment too. Every month, I'll be here for a few days. Wait a minute. What-What has this got to do with us getting married? Darling, I'm trying to tell you that we can't be married... but I can't lose you either. We can have each other. You'll have your own life, your career, and I'll have mine. Helen won't be hurt. Nobody will be hurt. Eddie, do you love Helen? Is-Is that what you're trying to say? No. I love you. But you don't want to marry me? - I can't. - Why? Is it because of those oil wells? I was wrong to try to break up your marriage. Well, never mind. It doesn't matter. Look. Maybe I said it wrong. No. No, you said it right. I just listened wrong. - That's the second mistake I've made with you. - Oh, Caroline, if you'll let me... Eddie, tell me something. What is it about women like us that make you hold us so cheaply? Aren't we the special ones from the best homes and the best colleges? I know the world outside isn't full of rainbows and happy endings... but... but to you, aren't we even decent? - What are you talking about? - I won't be your mistress! - Caroline, this kind of thing happens all the time. - Well, not to me, it doesn't. I'm too square for you, Eddie. But there are other girls... Oh, there are dozens of girls all over the city just waiting for you. You won't have to do a thing. You may have to take them to 21 once or twice... or-or eat a lousy casserole dinner in their walk-up apartment. They all like to play at being wives once in a while. And there'll be some that you'll hurt very badly... because they'll care too much. But that's their problem, isn't it? Then you'll find those who want just what you want... all love and no responsibility. Honey, hang on to those, even if it means... that they have to take on a few more like you in between visits. But don't blame them, because they, like the rest of us... they have an impossible need. They want to be loved. Caroline... Good-bye, Eddie. Hello. What's the matter, honey? Lost your key? - I'm all right. - Well, let's have a look. Go away! Leave me alone! Oh. Can't open the door? Open up in there.! Got a little girl out here lost her key.! - Come on.! Open up in there.! - Oh, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Oh, stop! - I'm tryin' to help, that's... [Screams] I was just trying to help her. [Ringing] Hello? Oh, yes, David. What? Oh, no... Oh! [Sobbing] Caroline, what is it? Oh, no! Gregg! Gregg! [Siren Wailing] [Man]Just an accident, lady. Just an accident. - What happened? - I don't know. Come on. Move back. Okay, it's all over with now. Come on. Let's go. Break it up. While your subject matter has appeal... your manner of presenting it... does not meet with the special requirements... of Derby Books. Thank you for thinking of us, and so forth. I think that's it for today. - Shall I clean up your desk, Miss Bender? - Yes, fine. - Anything else? - These rejection letters should be sent out tonight. Never mind. Monday will do. - Thank you. Good night, Miss Bender. - Good night. - See you later, April. - I'll be late tonight. - Ronnie's taking me to a movie. - Oh. Good. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Amanda. - Good night. See you Monday. Yes. - Good night, Caroline. - Good night. - Good night, Miss Bender. - Good night, Caroline. - Good night. - See you Monday. Good night, Miss Bender. - Pleasant weekend, Miss Bender. - Thank you. Romance is still The best of everything That sudden thrill The best of everything That one little sigh Is treasure you cannot buy Or measure Love can be all or nothing But even when it's nothing It's still the best The best of everything
