Tonight's song is a true rarity. It's a lullaby composed by Federico Garcìa Lorca. In this Valencian lullaby, Federico has managed to capture… ... the cultured and popular essence of the Spanish soul. -Yes. some passages from a lecture of his. "In melody, like in desserts, the emotion of the story finds refuge. The love and the air of our country... ...coming from song or from thick nougat paste... ...take us back to the living life of the past... ...as do the stones, the bells and the characters of the people. Unexpected rhythms can be encountered in the Spanish countryside... ...or melodic systems filled with a mystery... ...an oldness that escapes our dominion... ... but we will never meet an elegant rhythm... ...that unfolds with such serenity... ... not even if it sprouts on the tip of a flame. What's going on? - Are you Leo? - Yes, but we're live. Sorry, I lost a bet. I did it! - Who are you? - I'm Spanish, I come from a party. - Spanish? - My mother is Italian. - Why did you handcuff yourself to me? - We're handcuffed! - I did my penance. - What are you laughing at? - Oh! - What's up? - The bolso! - The bolso? I left the esposas keys in the bolso... - How do you call them? - Handcuffs. - Not handles? - She's crazy! - I'm not crazy! - What about this? Every night, when your show is on... ... it's so fucking boring! - I agree. We decided someone had to tell you, okay? - There was a sortejo... - You drew straws. - Right! - And I was picked. - Oh. - Are you offended? - Rana, do something. I can't do the show in handcuffs. - Why are you so serious? - Yes, OK... - You're young. - Rana! Look at him... Wow! You're so tall! Stefania, he's so tall! You'll see him soon, if you don't bring me the keys... ... I'm married to this guy for life. Beauties at the Bar I'll go crazy! I'll strip naked! - You're loose! - Very loose! < Come on, Simona! - Leo! - Huh? Come! Come here! - Leo, let's do a double! - Hi, Leo. Hi Clelia. What are you doing there? Strip with us. - Naked! Naked! - What are you on about? < Simona, you convince him! - Carry on, I'll go. - Come on, Leo. You could be a revelation! You're so handsome! - Come on, leave him alone. < Not the shoe! - Is he taking the other? - Yes, take it! Simona's got some explaining to do. < Show us, come on! - Simona, hold me! - I'm not looking. - Males' butts hold better. What a fool! - Help! - That's enough. Listen... < It's not all that...! < It's a beast! I don't want to see them any more. Crazy stuff... Leo? What, did you get offended? You absolutely have to come and see. You men have to surprise us, or you'll lose us! - Come on, Leo! - I have to surprise you? You're the ones surprising me. I'm so surprised, you know what I'm doing? I'm leaving. - Leave? But you just got back! - Now I'm going to the toilet. - I do it every day, does it surprise you? - Was he offended? I have to surprise... - I'm surprised by you, women! < It's a game, don't be stupid. < Open! - Tell that primate to put his elephant back in his pants... ...then maybe I'll open. Did he really get mad? Hurry, I have to pee too. I'll handle this. Hold this for me for a moment. Leo! Simona had nothing to do with it, it's all my fault. - You know I'm the biggest slut! - No need for you to say that. < Don't justify yourself, Stefania. - Nobody's asking you anything! I'm here, waiting, locked inside my own bathroom! I'm waiting like an idiot! I'm waiting! If Leo's really mad, I'll get you divorced this time. I know him. He leaves tomorrow, he found this mess... Actually, I'm going out now. to prepare properly... ... in peace, calmly... ... he needs to take his time. He felt provoked, maybe he's not entirely wrong. No, you have to stop taking the blame! < Simona, open up please! < I'm locked in the bathroom! Again? That can't be! - Not like that! Calmly and methodically! - Tell me how I should do it. - I'm locked in the bathroom... - We got that! The toolbox is in the closet... ...go get it... ...take the small screwdriver, then, calmly and methodically... ...unscrew the two small screws. What are they doing? Simona, don't mix up my nails. I sorted them by size! I only see the big screwdriver! I can't find the small one. Leo, it's really big! Everything's big here tonight! It's serious! I used the small screwdriver last time... ... there's no way I didn't put it back. And in any case, don't mix my nails! Why did you turn the toolbox upside down? You did it on purpose! It took me a week to sort the nails. Let's do as I said, or we won't... < Shall we kick it in? - Kick the door in? Simona, I forbid you to kick the door in! < (Simona) Leo, it was Stefania's birthday! Be flexible! < (Leo) I'm just saying, if Stefania wanted to watch a stripper... ... she could've arranged it at her own home. I told you, her mother arrived out of the blue... ...and we changed plans. Stefania turns 40, and she lets her mother influence her! Leo, she is an elderly woman, she's diabetic. Can't an elderly diabetic see a stripper? I found this, Should we call the wildlife department... ...or do we adopt it? Put it with your underwear. Just for a change… You're not funny. I don't like these innuendos. How can smart women have so much fun with an idiot... ...wearing an elephant down there? - Because we're smart. - Yeah? - Ironic and intelligent. Ironic out of desperation... ...and smart, because we still want to have fun. Should I wear a frog down there for you to have fun? No, a panda. A panda? Was that a joke about endangered species? Doesn't it bother you to sleep in that collar every night? I'd feel worse without it. Plus, you know, when I get angry... It's just a door. We can fix it. Why did you take your collar off? Turn around, come on. I'm sorry, it stings. Is it because you're leaving tomorrow? I'll put the collar back on. What's that, a cha cha cha? - What time is it? - It's 6 o'clock. Cha-cha-cha at 6 AM... How nice! Remember that time in Greece? Camping in Santorini? Cha-cha-cha! - Why did you set the alarm at 6? - I have to pack my bags. - What time is your train? - At 11 . - That's Five hours from now! - I need my time. - What are you packing? - I don't know. I'll be away two or three weeks, at most. - That's a lot! - It's not an easy restoration. - You stay in bed, I'll make breakfast. - No, I'll do it. No, I'll prepare it. What's this? I went to the clinic yesterday. I was nearby... They'd been there for over a year, we forgot to pick them up. You forgot, I didn't. It would have been a girl. Boy or girl, what does it matter? I don't give a shit about knowing any more. Actually, knowing it made me feel warm. I don't want coffee. Give me the orange juice. You are stuck with this attitude as if it were someone's fault. But it doesn't depend on you or me. It happens, right? Many women lose their child on the fifth month. It's a terrible thing. But then, it's not fair that... ... a husband and wife would... ...yet, it's so cold between us, now. We're fine when we are with others... ... but when we're alone... Can you shut up? Can't you tell when it's time to shut up? All right. I'll pack my bags. < (Guido) I'm glad you accepted this job. You're great at restoration, but it's also a matter of friendship. I'm convinced that a great adventure awaits us. It's not every day you make a discovery like this. < How'd you get it? < By chance. Buying the furniture from an inheritance lot. The owner was a loner, a misogynist... ... very chatted-about here in Piacenza. He was a very serious scholar. He'd quote St. Augustine while getting ass fucked. - At least he was religious... - Right. When I saw it, I realized that something wasn't right. You can see it too: it's the usual gothic subject, questionable workmanship... ... but it was mounted on a very nice frame. That's where my doubts came from. - This is the late 16th century. - More or less. I got the suspicion that something much more important was underneath. The X-rays proved me right. There's a beautiful Madonna under there. Until we get her out, it'll be hard to attribute it. From what little I gather, it could even be a Gentileschi. - These misfortunes happen only to you! - Shut up, Leo. - What's up? - I hope I didn't get a hernia. - To the neck? - No, that's my neck pain. - I really have that. - Didn't you suffer from sciatica? - That, I've always had. - And you do anything about it? My physiotherapist recommended pelvic gymnastics... ... but I don't have time. Why don't you have sex then? Oh, right... You don't have time. < Hah... You're funny! - I'll find you the right physiotherapist! < I don't need a physiotherapist. I just need to check the data, please. Here they are. X-rays, pigment tests... Is this the Madonna? For the sake of all Christians, I hope not. She's a Slavic refugee. A contortionist. - She works in a circus? < No, she only performs in bed. She's a force of nature, she comes at you from all sides... ...when you least expect it. A textbook thing! And your wife? Didn't I tell you? I left Betti. You left Betti for this one? - I'm so sorry. - I'm not. Betti in bed is rigid, motionless. Don't give me that shit look! - Do you want me to tell you the details? - Don't tell me anything. - Do you know what she does to me? - No, and I don't want to know! I don't know, but whatever it is, I'm sure it's fine. - Are you shocked? - No! - The bathroom lock... - I fixed it. Relax. What's this noise? It's been going on for two years. Very good. Thanks, I always have trouble with bathroom doors. I pressed the inside button, then realized it's a catch. But I get it, now. Thank you. Yes? Thank you. - How was the trip? - Fine. There weren't many people. - Do you like the hotel? < The room is nice, clean. It's all good. - You didn't bring your asthma meds. - Did I forget them? < Yes, I found them in the locker. How did you forget that? You always annoy everyone with your allergic asthma! Anyway, I wanted to remind you. Just stay away from cheese tonight. < See you soon, bye. - Bye. - Yes? - Good evening. It's always me. Has there been any cheese here in room 405 lately? - Cheese? - Cheese and cheese products. Who was here before me? A lawyer from Asiago. Did you serve him cheese for breakfast? This guy's crazy. Can you point me to an open pharmacy? The closest one, please. < It's an emergency, I suffer from allergic asthma. Take a left, then the second street to the right. - Where, again? - First left, then right. Do your best! - What about the tapestry? - That's from the 17th century. The price is firm. Alright, we'll talk about it. Thank you, goodbye. Enough work for today. Let's go to my house for a special night. - In what sense? - In the right sense. Trust me, Leo. - Leo, do you want a Negroni? - No thank you. I don't drink. A Negroni before dinner is a classic. If you really don't want to drink, at least nibble on the orange slice. - It's so sexy... - Watch your hand. When it comes to sex, Leo is a beast. - Guido is a joker. - And you're so serious... - Yes, thanks. - Don't worry! I like serious men. (Guido) A little boy decides to spy on his older sister. He goes to her room and looks through the keyhole. She's naked on the bed, touching herself, saying: "I want a man." This keeps happening for four nights straight. On the fifth night, he looks in the keyhole... ... and sees a man on top of her sister. The sister is moaning... He runs to his room, gets naked on the bed... ... touches himself and says: "I want a toy train!" Excuse me. - Guido, what are we doing? - I'm just putting on some music. - Who are those women? - They're two models. - Them? - Yes. - Do you like yours? - My what? - Look, she's very sensitive. - Guido! - Leo! - Trust me! - Don't say that. ...so Franco and I left the nightclub. It was one of those nights when all women look hot after 3 AM. The only ones we managed to get were... ...a divorced accountant, her sister and a friend. We went to the divorcee's house. Everything seemed to be going well... ... but her friend decided she wanted to go home. - Your favorite vintage. - Thank you. - You're welcome. The divorcee got up to accompany her. I gave Franco a look, he understood right away... ...and said: "Guido will accompany her". I said: All right, I'll go". I went and came back. When I arrived, everything was dark. I got in, looking for the light switch... ...suddenly, a body's pressed against me... ... I touch it: boobs, garter belt. Luckily, it wasn't Franco! < Then what? - It was dark, it wasn't my house... ... I was polite and let her continue! She begins to undress me. After a while, we were naked... ...on two different planes. < Be more precise. - Like this? - No, come on. Leo's here. I'm there panting when the light comes on... ... I see the divorcee and Franco on two different planes, too. - You mean like this? - No, like this. As it happens, there was four of us. What planes are we getting on? Which plane would you like to go to? - Good evening. - Good evening. < (TV) It's so nice, darling! Isn't that wonderful? < Call the number on the screen and you'll know everything about me. < It feels so good... ! < Feels fantastic... < (Stefania) Hello? - Simona? Didn't you recognize me? - Stefania, did you sleep at our place? < We just got back. Will you get Simona for me? We drank a little. Can you tell? Leo, don't interrupt us! We're doing confessions! < What's going on? - Intimate confessions! - You know what your wife told me? - No, come on, Stefania! - She told me she masturbates every night. - That's not true! - Yes, that's what you said! - I didn't say that. - I said every other night. < Stefania, can I speak with Simona? I've always done it, it's a habit. - Stefania, can you pass me Simona? - She can't speak. She's totally out! - I've never seen her so drunk. - I'm not drunk! I'm not drunk. I'm a woman who is still capable of having fun. You're not here and I enjoy it. The two of us don't know how to have fun together. - Give me the phone. - You think I'm an asshole. < I don't think so... - You're like your mother. < What does my mother have to do with it? - Now stop it. Leo... ...I love you... ...you love Me... ... we both know we love each other. - But together, we're a mess. < I don't feel like... We don't know how to laugh any more, how to fuck any more... ...we're only good at finding each other's faults. So let's make a decision. < Let's just fuck off! < I don't want to talk about it now! We can't even have a child. < Do you realize this? Enough now. This was lucky of us. We believed in having a child... ... but it wouldn't have solved shit. Yes yes, woof, I'm going. Is anybody there? Open up! Is anybody there? - Did you carry all that up the stairs by yourself? - Yes. By yourself? What are you talking about? I did two floors with that thing on my back! If only it was a nice pig... - We would have eaten pork all year round! - I can't stand you. - She won't say, but she's crazy about me. - Yes... - What's not to love? I'm handsome, young, slender, Calabrian, a security guard... - What a smart one! - I gave him a heart tonic. Let him rest now, he'll recover soon. - Take him to my clinic tomorrow, if you need. - All right. There's something wrong with men so tall. Go get your bags. < Here's the prescription. Can you give injections? < I can't. Gianni's here, anyway. - See you tonight at Ugo's. < I don't know if I'll come. < Thank you, Luca. You're always so nice. I'm going. - Are you still here? - I'm going now. Move! - Does he know? - Will you go, please? Giulia, I'm only saying this for your own sake. When he knows, he won't understand, and you'll feel bad. John, it's my business. Yes. You're finally awake! You gave me a scare! - Where am I? - Let's take off your shoes. Mrs Chiara always said that shoes on the bed are bad luck. Hats too, but I never understood why. Maybe because they used to put hats on dead people at funerals. Mrs Chiara Borsetti? What does Mrs Chiara have to do with it? Have some tea. - Do you still paint? - Paint? No, I'm a restorer. Too bad, you were good at painting. I want to show something. How does she know I used to paint? I quit ten years ago! Where am I? My head... < Leo, are you sick again? - Leo? < Come on! I knew they were here. "The brides and the princesses". You drew them and I colored them. I was so good at coloring them! After all, I was only five years old. - Who are you? - Leo, can you draw me a bride? Draw me a princess. Giulio? Yes, but call me Giulia now. - Are you Tuscan? - Yes. (in Tuscan dialect) Can you give me a Coca-Cola with a short straw? - Isn't that how you Tuscans talk? - Yes. - Take the air out of the syringe. - I'm taking it out now. - Drop your pants. - Yes. Are you familiar with injections? My father was a nurse for twenty years, down in Calabria. He worked at the criminal asylum. To teach me, he would have me practice on oranges... ...and then on schizophrenics, phobics, paranoids. What are you, a graduate? Yes, I have a degree. I studied three years in the seminary... ... then they kicked me out for acts against purity. Nice buttocks, huh? - What will it be, right or left? - Right, thank you. First quarter, top right. - Stay soft. - Yes, I'm trying. Are you staying for long? A day or two... a week at most. - Stay soft. - I'm soft. - Are you and Giulia really cousins? - Yes, Giulio and I are cousins. - First cousins? - We're just cousins. - Stay soft! - Are you doing this or not? (Leo) "Dear Simona, let's see if I can write to you... ...without being pathetic. I always become pathetic when I write." - Do you mind if I water the flowers? - No, actually, go ahead. What do you say, will our musician find the chord? Gianni will come soon, he does my shopping. - Do you have any preferences? - No, I eat everything. But I'm allergic to cheese. I'm allergic to cat fur! Did you sleep well last night? You know, different beds... I'm used to sleeping in more... normal beds. You know, normality here... Wonderful thought... ...it's born creepingly... ...it could be a need for love... ...better not say... ...and you, and us... ...and her between us... ...I wish, I wish... ... her hands, hers... < (Giulia) Leo, can you come over here for a moment? Yes? I want an opinion, which one do you think is best? - Best for what? - I'll choose this. - What's up? - Giulio, if I decided to stay... ... I'd like to contribute in some way. I may be a mess as a man, but as a woman, I'm rich. Luckily Gianni is here making me buy treasuries. He breaks my balls but at least he makes me buy treasuries. What I mean is... I know that you people's job... ...yes, your work... ... I don't know if you... Yes, I'm a hooker too. A hooker, huh? Back in school you were going to be a surveyor! Yes, so... I always mix you up with your brother, Renzino... ... he was studying orthodontics. He's a year older than you. It's got nothing to do with this anyway. - So you're a hooker, huh? - I don't work on the street... ...under the rain, with broken shoes... ... with makeup undone, like a junkie... ...and cars driving by splashing me all over. Nothing so dramatic! First class hotels, paid-off car... ...select clientele... ...credit cards are also accepted. I realize it's a thing... Theorizing is one thing... Plus, you're my cousin. It would be the same if you were my female cousin. It's clear that it's always… Boy, it sure is hard to be grasping at straws! - You can stop, you know. - Yes, it might be better. Leo, you're family, don't worry. < (man) Hello, Giulia? How are you, Miss? < I see you every night in your car... ...in front of my house. < I told you, you shouldn't be there. < I like you a lot, but you shouldn't be there. < I see you at night and I don't sleep, I want to sleep at night... ... or I'll come down and rip your legs off. < I like your legs. < You don't know... ...how much I like your legs. < Yes, you do know. Guido, I'd like to show you something as soon as possible. It's nothing, when you're ready... - He's shy, but he's a very good restorer. - I'll take it. - Okay, I'll go tell him. - I'll take this. - Did you see who that was? - Who? What do you mean? You turned white when you saw her! - That girl, you say? - You don't get it, then. - What? - That's Giulia, one of the most beautiful trans in Piacenza. - A trans? - Would you like to meet her? - Who, me? - You're the usual bullshit moralist! - She's almost like a woman. - That's right... Almost. Leo, in case that idea bothers you... ... you can hardly notice she has it. She's not like the Brazilians. Guido, this kind of talk makes me a little... come on! You've gone all red! - So you wouldn't go with her? - Never in my life! They can do crazy things to you. It's not like with those clock-watching hookers... ...or ordinary women who don't fuck any more. Enough with these clichés! This issue bothers you. You've seriously gotten worse. - Do you still fuck or not? - I'm here to restore. - Can't you do both? - Do it yourself! So for you, the idea of ​​a beautiful woman with a dick... You know, the whole anal and perineal area is highly erogenous. - All the nerve endings are there. - Where? - In that area. - Do you mind if we change areas? - She has no other. - No, you don't see any others. - Come on, tell me the truth. - The idea of ​​the weiner bothers you. - Nothing bothers me! Will you leave, please? If you go with one of them... ...you know he has it. You make the best of it, or you don't... ...or you leave it to chance. - ... you have many possibilities. - Now that I know, I'll rest easy. You would make the best of it, and deeply so. So you insist, huh? I'll leave you to your restoration. - Anyway, you're a moralist. - No, let's make things clear. - Mine is not moralism. - Then what is it? It's a situation where... ... why do I have to explain it to you? - Go open! - There's nothing to explain. - You're a moralist. - Yes, I'm a moralist. Someone has to be, or... Guido, I have a question. Have you been with that Giulia? How would you know she has a penis? Ah! Sisters... I don't know what got into me. When I saw you at the shop... I didn't expect it, I was a coward! "It was the surprise." What surprise? I'm a coward and that's it! "It caught you off guard, don't dramatize." Giulia, you're nice to defend me... "But it's not about niceness!" Giulia, let me talk. You're nice to defend me but I'm still a coward. Things have to be said for fuck's sake! No, "fuck's sake" is too much. Good evening. I speak to myself, I don't know who that guy was... I'm going to bed and that's it! < Is that you, Leo? Yes. < I had some free time today. So I said to myself: "I should unpack his bags." Then I thought you'd rather sort your stuff yourself. You don't mind if I did, do you? - No. - Thank goodness. I had a lot of second thoughts. Maybe there are things you don't want to show. That's a little present for you, but it's no longer a surprise. I was shocked when you appeared in front of me. I didn't know you worked there. I saw that in the window... However, we were good at pretending nothing happened. Guido knows me very well. - Did he tell anything about me? - No, no. < He's a discreet person. - Yes indeed. Wow, this is nice! You shouldn't have! - How can I repay now? - You'll paint me a nice picture. I'll leave you, so you'll put your things in the drawer. He really turned into a woman. A woman! Well, a woman… < (man) You are the chosen one. Scoop up the poop with a spoon… ... with your hands... ... with your tongue... Pick up, clean, obey... Pick up the poop! Pick up the poop, you bitch. Obey, I told you! Move that tongue! Pick up! Pick up! What is it now? Do I have to open? No! I don't know him. I'm sorry but I won't open. Antonello! Leo! Leo! - Yes! - Come here, quick. Help me lay him on the couch. Stay up, don't let go right now. - Were you awake? - Why, did they ring? - I was in bed. - All dressed up? - I dozed off. Giulia, I can't breathe! - I have asthma meds over there. - Yes, the meds! - Where should I put him? - On the sofa. - It's a man. - What did you think he was, E.T.? - I can't move my tongue. - What the fuck did you do? - You took something, didn't you? - Giulia, I can't see! - Should I take him to the hospital? - I don't know. - Not at the hospital! Stand still with these hands! What should I do with you? Antonello, you have to stop... Go call an ambulance. Can't you see it's bad? - But where... - The number's next to the phone. Leo, hurry up please! Antonello, what should I do? - I'll call your mother. - No, no! I won't take this responsibility. It's not fair, understand? You can't come here every time something happens to you. You'll get me in trouble! Antonello, one of these times I'll strangle you. How much fucking makeup are you wearing? You can't be seen like this! No wonder you get pimples... ... with all this shit on, your skin can't breathe. Why don't you thin your eyebrows? - So? - Phone's always busy. - What should we do? - We're taking him to the ER. - Are you his parents? - No. - No. Then you have to wait outside. < I can't take it any more with this boy. < It's nothing serious, they'll only keep him for a couple of days. I won't say anything to his father, he's sleeping now. I'll let him sleep. His shift starts at 6. You convince him. He has his diploma in accountancy... ...why does he need to become a woman? I had him do a lot of sports. Just to complicate your life! But luckily, I'll die soon. - It's dawn. - What? I said it's dawn. There are some choices you don't make consciously. You have it inside. When I was six, I'd take all the scarves... ... tie them around my waist... ... I'd make a petticoat out of it... ... I'd stand in the middle of the room... ...and I said: "I'm a ballerina!" Mom didn't say anything, sometimes she even laughed. We imitated the Kesslers. ... Dadaumpa! Dadaumpa! But her expression would change whenever my father was home. "Come on, take off these rags!" "Hurry up, daddy's coming." I'd take them off... ... but inside, I'd remain a ballerina. Do you remember how strict my father was? Uncle Gino... He would look at me. As long as I was little, he played dumb. And then he got ill with his nerves. I know I've caused much pain in the family, you know. But those who feel like dying must die, not those who feel like living. - Is this from the family album? - My grandpa, a vintage self-portrait. Come on! I have to work. - At what? - Don't you see? - You don't look well today. - Yes, it's because I'm... - What happened to your finger? - The slavic contortionist. What happened to your head? It's 5 PM, it's gin and tonic time. Oh right! You don't drink! Take an olive and keep me company. The bar idea isn't bad, I was also thinking of a hairdresser. ... But a shop feels so much like early retirement. A pub, on the other hand... ...it's nice, right? We're lacking the customers, but once it's open... In six months, a year at the latest, it should be ready. People might get lost in the city, walk and walk... ... then see this sign... ...Do you like it? Imagine it's lit. It's like finding the heart of the city. Well, "the heart"... Open all night, but not for anyone. - I don't want the lungs. - Lungs? - The terrible customers. Even moths are forbidden to enter. They're the ones you can't shell out a penny from. I am one of those people... If they give me a ring... ... I'll say: "If you give me another one, I'll make a pair of earrings." - You're an expert. - A little shrewd conception. - And where does this come from? - Immaculate Conception. - Astute conception of life. - Ah, I see. And then, in extreme cases, I'll go back to using the ATM. Do you know what the ATM is? I thought I knew but... ? The bounty we are all sitting on. My tax haven... do you get it? Yes, I get it. If someone pisses me off, I'll put Gianni as a bouncer. His neck's as wide as his waist! - You could do it too. - I'm a man of thought. - At best, I could use telekinesis! - Didn't you ever get in a fight? - What? Are you crazy, woman? - You said woman! - Woman, man... it's the same, Giulio. - No, you said woman. - Put on your glasses for a moment? - Why? Just put on your glasses. Done. Well? Come here a moment. Today I'm off early. Giulia! If I have to go get your groceries, I'll have to hurry. Today is Thursday and I have the afternoon shift. It doesn't matter, I'm going shopping today. - With him? - With Leo. With him. Instead of the groceries, could you fix the kitchenette for me? Bye. - Shall we go? - Where? - Shopping! - Ouch, my hair! Giulio! - How much are you buying? - When in doubt, I stock up. Oh! You're allergic to cheese! Me? Oh, yeah. - Yes or no? - Yes. Take those two, at this point... How much rice are you getting? - Don't worry, I'll give it away anyway. - The rice? It's all part of a plan. < (cashier) 450,000 lire. - I'm paying by check. I'll need ID, then. I'm sorry, but... ID photos never do justice to the original, do they? < Yes, but who's this Giulio? < I'm sorry but I'll have to call the manager. < All right. Indeed, call the store manager, Mr. Leopardi. - We're very close. - I have the money, I'll pay. I have cash, I can pay! There's a lady here who wants to speak to the manager. - She's a friend of his. - Let me help! Don't worry. I'm glad to see him. Thank you. Wonderful thought... ...it's born creepingly... ...it could be... Arnaldo! Arnaldo! Good evening. - What is it, Leo? - Why didn't you tell me? - What? - I can play... ... but I want to know the game. Are there rules? What are they? Are they compatible with mine? If they're not compatible, I'll retire! This one's expired. Sorry if I embarrassed you. What embarrassment? I mean, that, too... That's the way I am. I don't like those little games. I don't enjoy it! I didn't even have fun as a kid. I'm a curmudgeon, I got it from mom. Peace to her soul and peace to mine too! Giulio, I'm a serious person. It's my limit, and that makes me boring. - Pass me the cans, please? - I'm drinking one. Tell me the truth, Leo. - You're ashamed of me! - What are you talking about? - You were ashamed. - What... Ah! What are you talking about? What was the point of screwing him up like that in front of everyone? He's the lung that calls me every day. He changes his voice, his message, but it's still him. He comes with me once a month, then breaks my balls every day. He's been bothering me for a year! So why don't you report him to the police? Yeah, right! Leo, wake up! I live in a world where laws are not the rule. Do you get it, or are you too hypocritical to understand? At least I'm something. What exactly are you? Giulio... ... don't be offended, okay? You were very nice to me... ...but maybe it would be better for both of us... ... in short, I should... You want to leave? Yes, I'm thinking about it. I know, it's not easy. Maybe I was wrong too, telling you to stay here. It's also my fault for not telling you how things are. But it's not your fault. It's me who doesn't... I only recently learned to love myself. I have to defend myself from assholes like that. At first I would laugh... ... I would always laugh like an idiot... ... even when I had those customers who come... ... more to break you, rather than to play. Well, I'd laugh. But then my stomach would tighten. It was sadness, more than fear. Those turds robbed me of all respect. And I agreed with them. I agreed, because it was me who wanted to break myself. I couldn't do it alone and put myself in the hands of these idiots. Anyway... ...I understand, it's not easy. If you want to leave... Bye, Leo. < (man) Whore! Whore! < You're a whore! I'll kill you! < I'll rip your head off, I want to see your eyes popping out of their sockets. < I'll eat you, I'll tear you apart, I'll butcher you! < I'll eat your heart, you ugly whore! Arnaldo, jerk off and go straight to bed! Are we ready? I'll come with you. I'll take your bags. It is a three-star hotel, but it's like a four-star. One of the owners is from my home town. They reopened it a month ago. It was a two-star hotel before, they closed it... The old owner had some shady dealings. But now, only the best people go there! Showbiz people, too! You know, Pino Carne was there the other day... ... the "I'm just an emigrant" guy. I'm just an emigrant... I have no demands... What's wrong? You forgot something? Shit, it was cold. You didn't leave. I dealt with Arnaldo for you. - Is Giulia here? - No... How are you? - Well. - She'll be here in a bit. She already knows everything anyway. This is my bedroom. - Are you coming to stay here? - No, I'll just leave my clothes. I talked with Giulia, I'm keeping them here for now. My house is too dangerous. Can you imagine my mother in this? If my father found out...! He's a southerner... ...tragedy of madness! - Oh sorry. Cute! - Can you give them back to me, please? - Are you coming here to change? - Not here, over there with Giulia. I always tend to overdo things. She gives me good advice. - What did they say at the hospital? - I have to be careful with hormones. I have to talk to a psychologist and to a lawyer. But I want to speed things up. - Are you really convinced? - About what? - About changing completely. - I am, why? At your age, I wanted to become a priest. I got off to a bad start. Right now, you feel like a man and a woman, 50/50, don't you? I just feel like a woman. I don't really see you as a woman, no offense. < I know, but do you know what they say in our circle? "The hormone drives out the big boy!" - Plus, with some willpower... - Quite a lot of willpower, huh? You don't know women physically. Have you ever been with a woman? What do I care about being with a woman? Don't get mad at hypotheticals! I feel like I'm talking to my father. I'm not coming from any prejudice! - No... - No, damn it! To me, you have every right to go with men. I'm just saying that before changing sex... ... you should try a woman. You would gain knowledge, and your choice would become a real choice. - Have you ever been with a man? - What's it got to do with me? Have you, or not? No. So what choice did you make? To be normal. A choice is a choice! There's also times where you want to fulfill an impulse. If I get an impulse, do I follow it? No! Whatever happened to consistency? Some people make it sound so easy, look at Guido. It's full of guys like that. If an easy thing become too difficult... it's not easy to me! Leo, I'm also very confused. But if you were to put a mirror in front of me... ... I wouldn't recognize myself in it. It's hard to always be saying "No, that's not me." After a while, you can't take it anymore. Who is it? Oh, it's you. - What are you doing here at this hour? - I work there, didn't you know? With that? It's hard to grab something clean around here. - Leo, I'm here with company. - The contortionist? - Yes. - And you bring her here? We wanted to do it in front of Gentileschi. - Give me a minute, I'll take my things. - If you want to stay... I get it. I'll leave my things here. - Leo, trust me. - Right... Good evening. - People are discreet here, right? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye, dear. Hey! - What are you doing here? - I finished work... ...I was walking, I saw your car. I thought I'd wait for you. I didn't mean to scare you. I got some croissants. Will you forgive me? - Giulio, I apologized, will you stop? - Leave me alone! - Why? - Go away! I don't want to see anyone right now, do you understand that? Are you troubling yourself over me? I don't have problems anymore. - Oh, really? - No. You're familiar with the subject by now, right? Next time, bring the croissants to my room, so you can see me working. You'll see it for yourself. Will you stop for a moment? You no longer have problems, you might as well have fun. You no longer have problems, I do. Giulio! They don't stay in one place! They move around! The other day, one even came from Turin. She said to me: "Do you have any Louis XVI chairs?" The ones with straight legs! I said: "No, I have the Louis XV, the ones with legs like yours." Coming. < Yes? - Is Leo there? < Who wants him? - I'm his cousin. - One moment. Leo, your cousin. - My cousin? Did she tell you she's my cousin? - She? - Not she, sorry... he. - He? Didn't she tell you she's my cousin? - Just a moment, we're deciding. - Give me here! - Yes? - Hi, Leo. Who is it? Him, or her? - What happened to your ear? - I'm going. - Yes? - What are you doing tonight? No, leave it. - Here. - Thank you. Gianni will never forgive me for this dinner. In fact, he will never forgive us. Be careful. - What could he ever do to me? - Giulia! - Giulietta! - Who are these two? - Don't worry. Let's go in. < Giulietta! - Giulia, are you working tonight? - We'll see you later, Giulia. < If we wait for you, will you work overtime for us? "Slow down guys! I can't do three, I only have two of these." I'm sorry, go inside. I'll take care of these assholes. - If you don't mind, I wanna talk to them. - No, Leo, please. I never get pissed off because then feel bad... ... but if they make me feel bad, I get really pissed. I'll speak politely. - Good evening, I'm worried about you. - Oh yeah? And why? I wouldn't want you to get arrested for simulating intelligence. - Fuck! - Holy shit! They caught me off guard. I was even ready to fight, but not immediately. I thought they would get out and I was watching the door. They didn't even open it. As it happens, he was left-handed. - Am I still bleeding? - No. - Take the ice off, you don't need it. - Who were those two? - Nobody. - One of them was sure something, because I felt it. - Just a little, Giulio. - It's just wine, no big deal. Gives me heartburn. I'm still groggy from the blow on my nose. Wine could make it worse. - What a tragedy... - I'm a teetotaler, I took a punch. - A rose for the young lady? - Yes, a rose for the young lady. < Thank you. This sparkling wine's not bad! Since I've been here, I feel like I want to paint again. - I make men creative. - I'm serious. I hadn't thought about it for ten years. - Then you will paint me a portrait. - We'll see, okay? Naked? What? Naked? Stop it! I'm more of a suggestive painter. What's more suggestive than me naked? Yes, Giulio. I'm a normal man. You know, normality is something you can fix. It's not a fatal disease. You're terrible, Giulio. Leo, you are fabulous! A rose for the young lady? - Can I have the most beautiful one? - Yes. - I'll take it then. Here you are. Bye. < A rose for the young lady? We made a flag. Raise the flag! Leo, you provoke me. No, come on. I adore women. Of any gender? My cousin Giulio is hilarious! Hilarious! I'll give you three for 1,000 lire. Actually, free of charge! Do you know what I am now? A minor tributary of the Po. I must be really drunk to do something like this in front of you. When I was six, you'd take me to swim on that bridge... - What bridge was it? - Did I really? - But where? - Ponte della Vittoria! Swimming under the Ponte della Vittoria would be disgusting today. "Can you export me a rat from Florence?" "Thanks, long live the rat!" "Can you export me a rat from Florence?" Oh boy... "I'm an emigrant's daughter, pay me in cash!" Emigrant? Uncle Gino never left Florence... ... not even to go on vacation. You were 18 and wore Olympic blue briefs. They looked great on you. You were handsome. That state of grace didn't last long. - Why do you throw yourself down? - Because it's the truth. One Sunday in August, I wanted to drown. Why? So you'd pull me out of the water, lay me on the shore... ...and then you'd fucking have to do it to me. - What? - Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. I've been in love with you since I was six years old. Giulio, I speak to you as lucidly as possible. I'm very happy to have found you again. It was in a bad place, you don't know how much you helped me. For this, I feel very close to you. I love you. Very much. You've become... Beautiful. But Giulio, we're cousins like always. Disgusting! Disgusting bats! Leo! < Where's the Gentileschi? - Where's the Slavic girl? < Did she steal it? How did she do it? - Contortionist. Oh my God! I never listened to Betti. You would have listened to Betti because you are a faithful man. You know what Betti would say if she were here? "Guido, framed like this, you don't look like a Gentileschi..." "You look much more like an idiot." Anyway, now I don't have Betti, I don't have the slavic girl... Let's face it, I no longer have a Madonna. If they're looking me, I'm busy. After all this effort... < Hi, Leo. Yeah, bye. Leo! Leo. - What are you doing? Running away? - Did you come after me? How can you leave me without even an explanation? "Leave you"? Come on! I forgot to call you. You haven't called me for 22 days! - Do you mind giving me an explanation? - Now? - You live here? - No, I live there. - The key? - It doesn't seem to be working. Antonello, leave the door open. I put the key in by mistake... Leo, tell me what's going on. Oh! - You could have told there was another woman, I... - Where? - Are you Simona? - Yes, she... - Let her in! Why don't you come in, Simona? I finally know Simona. - So you talked about me! - Not really. I tried many times, but he's so secretive. He's a bit like a bear. - That's right. - Don't pull my hair, you know I hate it. I was about to leave. So if you want to talk... Perhaps in this case, it's better for the wife to leave. - Oh god, what a misunderstanding! - We should clarify things. What's to clarify? It all seems clear to me. - No, thank you. - Simona! - You better listen to him. - Make up your mind. Please make your mind up. Remember my little cousin Giulio I told you so many times about? Uncle Gino's son, Renzo's brother, the dental technician. - Did I tell you, yes or no? - Yes, so? - Here you are! It's him. What am I do? Should I slap you? I'll go get my ID. Why did you slap me? - What's happening? - We're on the verge of a tragedy. - Why did you slap me? - First you say you don't live here... ... then she's your cousin. You really are an asshole! I lied to you earlier because you took me by surprise. If I tell you now that she's my cousin, do you believe me or...? - I'll be quiet then. - Here. I found my passport, is that okay? You don't have to prove anything. We're the ones invading your home, the problem is ours. It's not ours, it's yours. I've already solved it. Simona! Stop! Leo, tell her something! It's ridiculous for you to fight because of me. Simona! Giulio, I'm going. Excuse me. Simona! Simona! Simona! - What's going on here? - Don't you get involved, too! - You have to leave Giulia alone. - He's just my cousin. In fact, since you're here, can you tell her it's my cousin? - Let me through, please! - I fucked 4 cousins and 2 aunts! What about that? You sure love each other in your family. Are you fucking with me? I'm a man with a gun. A man with a gun can do crazy things. - What did you get yourself into? - Calm down, I'll fix everything. - Gianni, what's the problem? - I've been with Giulia three times. The first because I paid... ... the second because I helped her with her tax return... ... and the third because she took pity on me. Who gives a fuck if she's a man? I will never be able to afford such a beautiful woman. What do I care if she's not perfect? She's perfect for me. Gianni, I'm just a guest, a cousin guest. Understand? - I already told you, I fucked 4 cousins! - That's not my fault! You don't know how lonely it is in Piacenza for a Calabrian man. I know nothing. Shall we discuss it another time, yes or no? Don't raise your voice too much. You hurt me! Gianni, come on, don't worry. I'm leaving. Nothing happened between me and Giulia. - Is this your wife? - Yes, this is Simona. Before you crush her, will you take us to the station? I can't do it alone. Learn to suffer. Leo, your wife is pretty, you know? Really pretty! A flower! As you Tuscans say: "Can you give me a Coca-Cola with a short straw?" What are you laughing at? I find it funny that this happened to someone like you. - They're better. - What? - Your hair. - I don't take care of them anymore. - Right. What will you do with the suitcases? Should we ship them? That's no problem, Giulia will take care of it... Giulio. I haven't decided what to call her. - What are you laughing at? - I told you. I was trying to imagine someone as rigid as you... ... being together with a loose person. It's no laughing matter. Leo, come on! For once, we're having a laugh at our problems! The train is coming. Come on! If you want, I can laugh... ... but I didn't solve the problem. What do you think? Is it serious? Hi. May I? - Have you packed your bags? - Yes. - You don't mind, do you? - No. Well, that's how it ends. Why? What ending did you imagine between us, Leo? I don't know. I'm very confused. I've seen you in so many ways... ...but now, I only see your eyes. Is it bad? It can be very bad, because there's more. Not in your eyes though. Let's not fool ourselves. Put your glasses back on, take a better look. All right, I'll put them back.
