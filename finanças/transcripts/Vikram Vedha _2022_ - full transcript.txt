Once upon a time many years ago, there was a prosperous kingdom whose ruler was the brave Vikramaditya. A terrible drought fell upon the land. People were dying of hunger and thirst. Vikramaditya was deeply upset by his people's plight. A sorcerer then came to the King and said: "Vikramaditya, in the Vindhyachal caves, a body hangs from a banyan tree. "The great Betaal lives within the tree. "Bring Betaal to me so I shall burn him and make your kingdom drought free." Hearing this, the King set off on his journey. The journey was long and filled with treacherous obstacles. "Beware! Betaal will narrate stories to you. "And ask you questions about the story. "If you stay silent, yet know the answer, "your head will explode into thousand pieces. "And if you answer correctly, "Betaal with escape again." Vikramaditya, there is only one way out of this dilemma. Don't get taken in by Betaal's stories. Shall I tell you a story? Pappu, is this the place? - Don't be shy. - Yes, sir. This is it. I've done my job, now it's over to you. If they're not there, you've had it. Don't worry, sir. Believe me, they're in there. Pappu, here. Keep this. - Lie low for a few weeks. - OK, sir. Can we trust Pappu? Do we go in? Who knows how many they are. Shall we wait for backup? I hate hanging around. - Is this the time to show up? - Sorry, sir. We were held up sorting out the mess at KKC College. - Who's the raw meat? - He just got posted here. Totally raw! Sir, my name is Deepak. - Welcome to UP Police STF, Deepak. - Thank you, sir. - Married? - No, sir. - Girlfriend? Boyfriend? - No, sir. Prabhakar sir, he has a lonely life, and you're not taking care of your teammate. - He won't like our methods. - Why? Deepak looks weak. Had any experience, Deepak? Or... No, sir. Never got the chance. You'll get lucky today, Deepak, if you make it out alive. - Stay at the back. - Yes, sir. So, both brothers are late. Forgive us, sir. We had to deal with a property loan. Father borrowed money against some land, we paid it back in full today. Two worthy sons. How much did you lose on your bet this time? Everything, sir! But I'll win big on the next cricket match. Wow! - Informed the local police? - Done, sir. Ansari, tuck your belly in. Or else they'll see your belly before they see your gun. Ready? You first. You'd be dead, Deepak. Sorry, sir. Prabhakar-ji! Sir, please...I surrender. Too late for that. You run out of hiding places, then you decide to surrender. I wasn't thinking straight, sir. Where is Vedha? I swear. I don't know. - Where is Vedha? - Don't shoot! I'll give you whatever you want. Such as? Money, sir. Just name your price. Money is so overrated, Muni. It can change lives, but it can't buy one. Tell me a joke! Huh? Know any jokes? I remember a joke. Sir, how much is two plus two? Four. Six. - How? - By mistake. Not funny. I'll tell you another. An elephant and an ant... Don't be a wise guy. They're new gang members. Take them to hospital. Yes, sir. Abbas, why the hell did you stop? Deepak, this is a crime scene, not the Nimbu Park. - Stop strolling about. - Sorry, sir. Sorry. Wasn't that the shooter Muni upstairs? Yes, sir. He's been charged with 5 murders and 8 assaults. And him? No information on him, sir. He got sifted out, like chaff from wheat. Sir, he's unarmed. Unarmed? If the CP finds out, he'll order an inquiry. Where are the arms we seized at the Naka Hindola encounter? In the jeep. I'll get them. Who's got 38 bullets? Sir, I do. Deepak. Now your fingerprints will be all over the cartridges. You'll land up in Central Jail. Learn from Prabhakar. - Who took it last time? - I did, sir. So, Prabhakar, it's your turn. If Prabhakar-ji gets hurt, the red-light district will have to shut down. In the arm, please. - Deepak, hold his arm. - Sir. - No trembling, Deepak. - Yes, sir. - Prabhakar. - Yes. - Ready? - Yes. On three. One... - Why are you screaming? - Sorry, sir. Deepak, is he a lefty or a righty? - Don't know, sir. - Which wrist did he wear his watch on? Right...no, left, sir. - Meaning? - He's right-handed, sir. This is the story. We came in following these thugs. He opened fire first. Abbas ducked; the bullet hit the wall behind him. He fired again, grazing Prabhakar's arm. We returned fire. They ran outside, still shooting. We chased them. - Raja Babu got killed in the encounter. - Yes, sir. Muni ran in that direction. We ran after him, he fired at us. We fired back. He died at our hands. We had to fire in self-defence. - Understood? - Yes, sir. - Any doubts? - No, sir. Good. Yeah, I know, sir... The cops arrested the wrong guy again. I did a complete background check. He's a college student, sir. Squeaky clean. Madam Lawyer, my wife is missing. What? No, no, no, of course, I know. His father came to our office the other day. Near Moti Lake, sir, that'll be safe. Who? OK. Why fear the police, sir? Will you devour me with your eyes? Do you have eyes in the back of your head? That's why I hate cops. I hate lawyers too. Am I complaining? Look over there. We moved to Lucknow 6 months ago, and you still haven't unpacked. OK. Hey! Trading hearts is far from easy - What is it that you do? - I'm a lawyer. I hate cops. A whisky on ice. A large whisky with ice, please. But your magic has cast over me I surrender my heart to you O beloved I'm all yours, now it's your call I surrender my heart to you, O beloved I'm all yours, now it's your call You do all these things to me. Then give me a gift. I feel so used. Plucking the stars from the sky I can't promise you that My love is simple, without frills I lack the words to explain it Shall we go to bed? Please...let's sleep. Thank you. I surrender my heart to you, O beloved I'm all yours, now it's your call Sohail. Stay calm. It's OK. It's OK. What! Your son's school fees are 150,000 rupees! - Do they inject him with knowledge? - No, my friend. It's not for the knowledge. I send him there for the prestige. Many rich kids study there. Prabhakar, our CP sir's daughter studies there too. She's my son's classmate. Is that why you send him to that school? Want them to marry some day? You'll be invited! Here he comes. Why do you look so scared? Imagine your plight if you had to face Vedha for real. Vedha? Vedha who? Vedha Betal. Mithilesh Tiwari ruled Aminabad. He was a big shot. He had 12 armed bodyguards following him, full-time. Vedha killed him in a crowded marketplace. Ask me how. How? He jumped from the third floor with a sword. And whoosh! Tiwari was in two pieces. Imagine how horrified we were at the post-mortem. Kidney, liver, all mixed up. - Hey, Ranjan. - Sir. - New bike? - Yes, sir. 155 cc. Liquid-cooled engine. What's the torque? Don't know. But my wife said when she rides pillion, we must look the same height. So I bought it. 14.1 n.m. at 8500 RPM. You don't deserve it, man. - How is your arm? - Good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. - Deepak-ji. - Sir. Why are you in uniform? He doesn't like it here. He wants a transfer. I thought as much. My sister Gita's wedding date has been fixed. You must come. Wonderful, Giri! - Congrats! - Thank you, sir. - Head Constable. - Yes, sir. - Where's the IG? - Outside. Morning, sir. Vikram, the forensics report is here. Ballistic and gunfire residue are a 100% match. - Good job. - Thank you, sir. - Didn't Abbas show up? - He's taking his son to the hospital. - Hospital? - Chronic inflammation. Any news, sir? According to our sources, Vedha was at Muni's house for the memorial. I thought Abbas should check it out. - I'll go, sir. - OK. Sir, they all go silent when I ask about Vedha. Sir, I have some info on Raja and Muni's families. Raja Babu has no family, but Muni has a son. Name 18, age Dilip. Sorry, sir. Name: Dilip. Age: 18. Where is he? You didn't get the good stuff. - That's why I'm drinking this. - The cops. Run! Did you kill my father? Come to apologise? No. He was a criminal. "As you sow, so shall you reap." Good, the lowlife is dead. He'd get drunk every day and beat me. Familiar story. You too? With a belt. Father skinned me alive for the smallest mistake. Ever seen a police belt? I learned one thing from him. It's either right or wrong. Nothing in between. My father had nothing to teach me. Throw it down! Deepak, put the gun down! If they hear I faced my father's killer and did nothing, do you know what they'll say? Let go. Vikram, Sonu's been selected for the district cricket team. Want to meet him? No, sir. Some other time. And Sattu's son? He's a problem, but he'll reform. OK, sir. I'll be off. Sir, was I wrong to draw my gun? He could've killed you. He's just a kid. How could he hurt me? - Mister! - Coming, sir, two minutes. We're cops. We should know by looking into someone's eyes whether he's a criminal or not. Look at him. His eyes tell me he's an imposter. He'll say he couldn't find the chain sprocket. I tried very hard, sir. I found everything, sir, but not the chain sprocket. It's a 1985 model. Hard to find. Can I replace it with a new housing unit? Only 8000 rupees. Shall we shoot him now? Have you heard the engine sound? Dupu...dupu... That's the sound I want. Find that chain sprocket. OK, sir. Did you get it, Deepak? Know why we sleep peacefully after every encounter? Because we know we did not kill an innocent man. - You'll learn slowly. - Sir. They've been breaking the law for six months. 22 encounters to their names, but no sign of Vedha. Sir, he's the reason Vedha had to go underground. We must not forget why this unit was created. We had no other way of stopping Vedha. What's the difference between cops and gangsters? - Sir... - Wait there. Do you believe in police procedure? Or protocol? Of course, sir. We believe it's better if two gangsters die, rather than four cops. - Vikram! - We... I'm in charge of the Shivgadh operation. I take full responsibility. Take action against me. Please. Abbas, I lost my mind. Let them investigate me. What's the worst the scumbag can do? I didn't mean to abuse him, sir. I meant, sir... All right boys, goodnight. Sir! I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm fine. You guys carry on. The place where we were sitting was in a worse condition. This house belonged to my ancestors. It's in ruins now. And the night you hid a snake in the instructor's room? When he entered... Remember when we got caught? You took all the blame. Like you did today. Never mind. Forget that old story. - But those Academy days were... - The best. - The best. - The best. Those were the days... Don't start again, please. Vicky, there's blood on my hands, I've committed many crimes. - I can't remember... - Hey, hey! We're doing nothing wrong. To clean filth, someone's hands must get dirty. If no one does it, we must. Someday we'll have to pay the price. Or our families will end up paying for our sins. The son must pay for the father's sins. Stop this nonsense, Abbas. You don't understand, Vicky. You can sleep well. Sameera and I... I can't remember when we last slept peacefully. We spend every night fearing my son Sohail will have another attack. It's all your fault. I told you a dozen times, don't get me emotional when we're drinking. Who kept saying "on the rocks?" According to our sources Vedha was seen in Mirza Mandi. This is it, boys. Close Vedha's file today. Vedha was spotted in this building in Mirza Mandi. We'll position the riot control teams on these three junctions. Yeshwant, Giri, Deepak, Anthony. You monitor these points. - Make sure no one enters. - Sir. - Ansari, cover these three points... - Yes, sir. Prabhakar, Ranjan and Martin will be here. Don't let the local police enter, or our operation will be compromised. Abbas and I will go into the building alone. Sir. Remember, this is Vedha's territory. There are plenty of people who'd kill or die for him. Be alert. Be safe. Yes, sir. Let's go. He's Vedha Betal. Vedha, we hear you don't like people talking loudly. I'll speak quietly for your sake. Confess to all your illegal deals and murders. We'll try and get you a minimum sentence. This offer is valid only for today. So, start talking. Won't you talk? Well, I'll give you three options. A: We pull your nails out with pliers. B: Strip you naked and lie you on ice. Or C: Hang you upside down and tie a bag full of mice over your face. Talk! What is it? Cat got your tongue? We were interrogating Vedha. He pushed us aside and tried to escape. We fired in the air to stop him. Unfortunately, we blew his head off, sir. That's what I'll tell the Commissioner. Medal guaranteed. He's not talking. There's one thing though, he did turn himself in. He has a jackal's mind. A criminal mind, sir. And the question isn't why he surrendered, the question is... if he was safe underground, why did he come out? Shall I tell you a story, sir? I thought you'd taken a vow of silence. I learned long ago who to talk to, when, and how much to say. I learned long ago how to make people talk when I want them to. I'd like to see this same smile once you've tasted police hospitality. A guest is like a God. Will you mistreat a guest? Why surrender? I came to tell you a story, sir. Your story is all too familiar. "I come from a poor family. They all depended on me. "It started with pickpocketing. "Then circumstances forced me to become who I am." Your story, right? Shall I tell you more? If I offered you 100 million rupees and said: "Vedha, take it. Turn your back on crime." You'd refuse me point blank and go home. Then you'd start plotting how to rob that 100 million from me. That's your nature. If I offered you this same 100 million and asked you to let me go, you would not. You'd kill me the first chance you got. That's your nature. Nice. You and I are so alike, sir. We only exist because of each other. They both might have tails, but does that make a cat and a mouse alike? A cat exists because the mouse exists, sir. But the mouse has walked into a trap. Would the mouse do so willingly? This is no ordinary mouse. He's committed 16 murders. You're no ordinary cat. You have 15 encounters to your name. 18. Were you behind the Shivgadh encounter? That was Abbas Ali. Oh, yes? The encounter ended with three dead men? They fired first. We fired back in self-defence. No choice. I've killed 16, you've killed 18. - You're ahead of me, sir. - No. The question isn't about who's ahead, it's about right and wrong. This side of the line is right, the other is wrong. I believe you, sir. You're Ram and I'm Raavan. You forget Lord Ram played a vital role in making Raavan who he was. You're wondering if Vedha was safe underground, why did he come out? To tell you a story. It's important you hear it. Thief! Thief! Bye. Is that Parihar's son? The PWD contractor? Who took him? He was kidnapped from my territory. They want 10 million in ransom. Find out who they are. Boss. Boss, I think they're outsiders. No one in Kanpur would dare cross you. Your reputation is at stake. If news gets out that an outsider abducted a kid in Parshuram's territory, then it's all over for you. Get my spittoon. Boss, may I say something? Put it over there. - Boss, I think... - Go! - Who is he? - He's new. If he interrupts you again, I'll give him a hard slap. They abducted the kid from under our noses. Everyone was stunned. Why be a hero? Why poke your nose in? Don't push it. We're foot soldiers. This is our life. Why fight destiny? You think destiny will help you if you fight it? Destiny can be made. - Wow! - Such pearls of wisdom. Greetings, uncle. One man less. - Ask who. - Who? My father. He spent his whole life sitting around. You talk as if he ended up living in France. If he had only tried a little, he would've been successful. You're so right. Where would they hide a kidnapped kid? Get it? - The Ganga stretches for miles here. - So? Who knows? How will you find the kid here? It's vast. To fly you need to see the sky, not the land. Look over there. An eagle can see both the hunter and the hunted. That's the Ghansa gang. You thought it was your old aunt? - Uncle, listen to me. - Quiet. Let's plan. No plan, let's attack. No. I get out of breath very easily. Why did you come? Sacrifice your life for a smile Share the pain of others Love someone from the bottom of your heart What a song! When I was a kid, it was my favourite song. - It's a Raj Kapoor song. - Who are you? - Anwar, my gun. - What are you doing? What, man? I came for some action. You can see my knife. But let me hear the song first. Hey. Cool it! What's the hurry? We can start later. Oh man! Sacrifice your life for a smile Share the pain of others Love someone from the bottom of your heart That's what life is all about I admit my pocket is like a pauper's Yet my heart is like a rich man's Your choice of music is cool, but you're a moron. This is Parshuram's territory. Nothing personal. But I'm on his side. How can I thank you? No need. Consider it Parshuram's gift. Your efforts, and I get the credit. To whom do I owe the favour? Speak! I've been trying to, sir. But you didn't let me. What did you want to say? Kanpur's getting crowded, sir. Lucknow is calling. But you turned a deaf ear. From now on, Vedha will look after the contracting business. Boss, I won't spare Vedha. That scum doesn't know he's stuck his hand in a beehive. I'll bury him alive. It's not as easy as you think, Ravi. Parshuram's protecting him. Stay calm and focus on our heroin business. Everyone's here. Great! Children, listen carefully. I'll say it again. It's all about keeping eyes and ears open. Tell me. How can you tell if it's the police? Their sirens. Their shoes and truncheons. Their uniforms. Bravo! Remember what I told you. They don't always wear uniforms. They dress casually, too. Then how will you recognise them? Their short haircuts. Bravo, son. Short haircuts, chiselled moustaches, and super clean shaven. - Understand? - Yes. Yes. - What's your name? - Shatak. Mr. Shatak, in case you get caught with heroin, what will you tell the police? I found it lying on the road. Bravo! You know your lines. You've earned a round of applause. Bravo! Bablu gang is ready now. Bravo. Well done! Shatak, what are you doing here? Bablu called me. He calls and you come. Chanda, you're older. Why are you so stupid? Now go. Where are you taking them? Bablu, he's my kid brother. No wonder he's so sharp. He'll outsmart you, Vedha. I'll hit you with a pan, you'll end up in Japan. Don't taunt me. Tell Shiv Prasad. He told me to put the kids to work. You said if the police arrest us kids, they won't harm us. - You have a sharp tongue. - Yes, and so? - I'll show you... - Bablu! Does it look good getting beaten up by a girl? Watch your step, Vedha. Shiv Prasad is very close to Parshuram. And if we start... Oh man! My hands are shaking from fear. Idiot. Shut up! Why do you keep watching Shaktiman? He's a great guy. How so? He's a hero. What's a hero? Someone who helps the weak. Someone who helps the weak? I see. Is that easy? No, it's tough. I see. Who are you? What do they call you at school? - Shatak. - How come? I scored 100 marks in maths. A century, that's why. Was it easy? No. It was hard work. Why do you work so hard? To become a hero. Someone who helps the weak? Like Shaktiman? Yes. I see. Someone wants to be like Shaktiman. But he's wasting time with worthless people. Why beat around the bush? Come to the point. Don't waste my time. I'm going to Lucknow for three days. What will my hero do? Study and stay away from worthless people. Come, my hero! Great. Bablu's gang! The packets must be the same size. Got it? What will you say if the police catch you? We found it lying on the road. Not a word more. No matter what they ask. Now run. Quickly. Run! There's only one packet left. It'll get you arrested. Get rid of it. Shaktiman smashed all the thugs yesterday. - Shatak, take this. - No. - Give it to Chajju the confectioner. - Don't want it. - I'll give you 100 rupees. - 100 rupees? Chanda, stay out of it. You and your brother...go! Chanda, what are you doing? If my brother finds out, we'll both get whacked. Nothing will happen, Shatak. The police! Run, Chanda, run! No, no. This way. Come on, Chanda. Search me! Strip me. Want me to take off my underwear too? Madam, he's clean. I told you; I've mended my ways. Can I go? Madam, I found this packet in her bag. Why are you looking at me? She's the one with the bag. Who gave it to you? No one. I found it lying on the road. Why are you hitting her? Bablu gave it to her. He said: "Dodge the police, I'll give you 100 rupees." Look at this. - Why are you lying? - We're not lying. Madam, he's lying... We lost 50,000. And the business was shut down. - What was the boy's name? - Shatak, boss. We thrive on fear, Bablu. This boy will set a bad example for the other kids. He's Vedha's brother. So what? Scar him. Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall. Shatak, run. Where do you think you're going? - Come on. - Let go! Where are you taking him? Let go. - I'll tell Vedha. - Get lost! He's just a child. Let me go. It's nothing, brother. It won't affect my studies. I'll be more careful next time. It won't happen again. No, it won't. Never again. Now tell me, sir. Who will Vedha punish? Bablu who stabbed his brother's hand? Or Shiv Prasad whose orders he followed? Bravo. You save a child, but you shoot a guy in the back, and become a don overnight, Vedha Betal. When your days are numbered, you start talking in riddles. Do you believe you're the hero of your story? The question isn't about me, sir. The question is about the moral dilemma I'm facing. Moral dilemma? It's easy to choose between good and evil, sir. But in this story, they're both evil. That's the dilemma. Who will you punish? The guy who did it? Or the one who instigated it? Don't hold back. Punish the evil. Kill them both. I didn't expect that from you, sir. You know rules of punishment? One crime, one punishment. Right. One crime, one punishment. If I punish the doer, then the instigator escapes. And if I punish the instigator, then the doer escapes. Who would you punish, sir? Shiv Prasad or Bablu? Shiv Prasad ordered the attack, Bablu committed the crime. Bablu is just the trigger, Shiv Prasad's finger was on the trigger. The finger is to blame. Shiv Prasad should be punished. Did you act out of love for your brother? Or to rule the world of crime? - What was it? - Someone to see you, sir. Priya? Mr. Vedha is our client. He's our senior lawyer. And this is Mr. Vedha's bail order. If you were in a hurry to get bail, then why surrender? Check the bail orders. Is everything OK? Damn... Sir, you'd better talk to my lawyer. He's outside. Vedha, did they mistreat you? No, Bablu. In fact, we've become friends. I'm leaving, sir. What's your game? You have to figure that out, sir. Bablu, let's go. How could I know it was your case? You never tell me anything. Now you know. He's using you to escape the law. You're overreacting, Vikram. Mr. Vedha is our client. Mister? Bloody imposter criminal. Imposter criminal, but he has rights too. Come on, this is my biggest case. And Vedha turned himself in, didn't he ? You talk as if you'd risked your life arresting him, and I freed him. Priya! Sh*** It's OK. I'm fine. I'm fine. Think about it, Priya. How can we work on the same case, living under the same roof? What about our private life? We'll have to go to different rooms to take calls. Husband and wife working on the same case is a conflict of interest. My department will never approve, nor will the court. You're right. So what shall we do? - Drop the case. - You quit your job. Your job is real. My job is a waste of time? He's been accused of 16 murders. A special police task force has been chasing Mr. Vedha and his gang for six months, and you had him released in six minutes. Are you doing something noble by defending this criminal? No, your department is, in the name of law and order...those encounters. Priya must know there's a difference between us and them. Why marry me to a lawyer? Can I call you back? I'm driving. All OK? I'm going to the Old Mill. Got a tip off. Some Chanda says she has info about a drug deal. Shall I come? No, I'll handle it. Let me go. Shatak? What's wrong? I'm going to the Old Mill. Got a tip off. Some Chanda says she has info about a drug deal. Chanda, you're older now. Vikram? Who will you punish? The doer, or the instigator? - It was Abbas Ali's operation... - Really? Vedha's brother Shatak died in the Shivgadh operation. Vedha resurfaced to get revenge. But he wants the finger, not the trigger. I took Abbas's name by accident. Abbas. Abbas! Abbas! Did you inform Abbas's family? Sir. I'll do it. Vikram. You leaving without uttering a word O friend, why turn your back on me? You stood by me in all my loneliness So much is left unheard So much is left unspoken Come back. Make your way back to me O friend, is this the way to depart? The night SSP Abbas Ali was murdered, Mr. Vedha was attending a wedding in Agra. His travel and hotel details. Here are the photos and the footage confirming his alibi. Priya, Abbas was murdered. Our Abbas. Where's your conscience? I'll see you in court, sir. Thank you for your time. OK. Sir, Vedha killed Abbas. I hope you don't have any doubts about that. The bullets retrieved from Abbas's body were fired from Chanda's gun. - But sir... - Don't jump to conclusions, Vikram. CB CID is handling the case. They'll deal with it. If anyone interferes in Abbas's case, our unit will be suspended. Commissioner's orders. So, what do we do till the CB CID solves the case? Sit and stare at each other? What else can we do! Our unit will be the loser. The CB CID will conduct the inquiry. They think we can't do it. Are we that pathetic? We cannot let Abbas's death be in vain. Vedha. Let's kill that rat. But no one knows where the lowlife is hiding. His lawyer must know. Hello. Yes, sir. They'll charge him with something and arrest him. File for anticipatory bail immediately. Yes. I'll get the documents ready. We need Mr. Vedha's signature. Call him and... Sir, I can't call him. His phone must be tapped. So how do we get his signature? I'll get it, sir. Forgotten how to drive over 40? - Sir, madam is ahead of us. - She's his lawyer. She knows where Vedha is. A text. Who sent the message to Priya? Trace the number. Yes, sir. - Tell Prabhakar to overtake us. - Yes, sir. - Tell Giri to follow her. - Yes. Sir, madam is heading home. The phone's switched off now. The last location was right here. - Sir, I think... - Hang on. A black SUV overtook us back there. That's where they exchanged documents. Their car can't be far. - Find it. Quick. - Yes, sir. Yes, Prabhakar? Sir, we've found the car. He's buying biriyani in Mirza Market. Follow him. - Mirza Market. - Yes, sir. Sir, he just came out of Murgiwali lane. He has the file your wife gave him. OK, sir. This is the right place, sir. But which house? Which lane did he go down? Search every lane. There are over 250 houses here, sir. If we ask anyone here, Vedha will find out. Exactly. Move it! - Come on, go. Go! - Yes, sir. Where is Vedha? Sir, the police have surrounded the neighbourhood. If you stay here, the police will arrest you. The scum. Brother, want to fly kites? I'm playing hide n seek now. See you later. - Found him? - No. Brother Vedha. - Love you, Vedha. - Love you too, aunt. - He must've gone this way. - How to find him in this maze? What are you doing here? You bloody... Ansari, you go there. Yashwant, come with me. Over there. So this is police work. I underestimated you guys. I was sad to hear about your friend Abbas's death. Why did you kill Abbas? Why? Why? Why did you kill Abbas? Why did you kill Shatak? Abbas was a good officer. Shatak was a criminal. How can you compare the two? It's traumatic to lose a loved one. Damn it! It's the same emotion! It's the right time! And the right weather. Shall I tell you a story? Hey brother, look where you're going Not just ahead, not just back Not just left, not just right Not just up, down too Hey brother! Hey brother, look where you're going Is the job done? I'm heading towards Faizabad, sir. Why? I'll stop on the way. You should've killed him back there, Vikram. A crowd was watching, sir. No problem. I'll finish him off and call you sir. OK! End it soon. Sir, can I have a drag? Smoking is injurious to health. You will know in 10 mins what that really means! Here. Life too is like a cigarette, sir! One day it'll turn to ash. Till then take as many drags as you can. I've seen many lose their cool once they step out of their vehicle. Those guys give our profession a bad name. Wasn't your father a cop too? Didn't he die in the line of duty? Thanks to a criminal like you who fired before my father could. No wonder you don't believe in long conversations. Sir, why are you looking for your father's 1985 bullet chain sprocket? It's been 36-years. You won't find one now. Have you been spying on me? Is that why you used my wife? Sir... You don't show it, sir, but you're an emotional guy. Or else why try fixing an old motorcycle? That's not it. It was rotting in my garage, I thought I'd have it fixed. And Muni, sir? The man you killed in the encounter. You pay for his son's education, right? - You're an emotional guy. - Balls to emotions! I don't want one criminal to die and be replaced by another. How are you so sure, sir, that a cop's son will be a cop, a criminal's son will be a criminal? Then Einstein's father and son would be like Einstein. Do you even know their names? Cut the crap! Get up and run! I will run, sir. I will. But first hear my story. Aren't you very emotional about Abbas? My story has the same emotion. Think of it as my last wish and hear me out, sir. Thief! Thief! Only two people can save you when you're in trouble, Lord Bajrangbali or Vedha Betal. Where have you kept all the MLAs? Never question good fortune. Tell Parshuram I said hello. We'll be late getting to Aminabad. So I'll step on it. Full speed. Oh man! The traffic won't ease up if you keep honking. It's never so crowded in the afternoons. What did you say? Brother, tissues? Kill him! Vedha. Don't stare at me! Run. Brother! Your Mother...! I'll fix you. Why help me? Should I have just stood by? What are you doing? Why are you screaming, brother? It's his day for screaming. I don't want you mixed up in this mess. Why did you get into this mess? Why not? We had nothing. This is how I earned my swag? Lucknow's famous for two things: Tunday kebab and Vedha's swag. How did you earn your swag? Powerful men bowed to me. - How did that happen? - Through my own power. And how did you get it? Money. If money could be earned honestly, then why bother with this mess? What are you talking about? Look here. Aunt used to sell poppadums on the street. Now people line up at her shop. They wait hours to buy them. And here. Baiju Biryani Centre? It started as a street stall. Now they have branches all over Lucknow. They even export biryani to Dubai. How did that happen? The 500,000 you gave me for expenses, I invested it in their business, in their hard work and honesty. Small loan, big smile, brother! Things looked up for them, and we made big profits. All legal, after-tax. Brother, give me a chance. Make a big investment in my company. So you can keep your reputation and I can keep my word. Brother... Why make up such a long story? Come to the point. Don't waste my time. Small loan, big smile. Small loan, big smile. Thank you, brother. No mention. I know that much English. Chanda, we'll make Vedha brother stop all his illegal business. From tomorrow we'll lead a white-collar life. You listening? Isn't it great news? You're always carrying on about Vedha. Vedha will never give up the world of crime. Nor will you stop praising your brother. You know what? Get out! Go live with your brother. He'll pamper you like a child. Shut up! You've always been on his side. I still don't mean anything to you. I know what you think of me. I'm older than you. So why would you marry me? You're grown up, but you still cling onto Vedha. You're an idiot. Chanda, I work 18-hours a day. Who is it for? It's for you! You're my life. Oh? You forgot to wish me happy birthday too! It slipped my mind. It's no big deal... You never admit your mistakes. Shut up! Another word from you and I'll strangle you. You remembered. Your mother... - What language is that? - Marathi, I guess. Why is the Mumbai gang after us? We have nothing against them. Why rob from a robber? What has the world come to! You fool, we're not thieves, we're gangsters. There's a difference. What's the difference? Thieves and ruffians work alone. We're a gang. The Vedha gang. Therefore...gangsters. - The Vedha gang. - Exactly. Show me your tongue. All your sucking up has shrunk it. You know nothing, but you act so smart. I would've known if they were local goons. I watch everyone. The Mumbai gang has made big trouble... Every problem has a solution. Just look for it. I see nothing, bro. One of us ratted. Who gains from our defeat? Think! - Boss. - Vedha. Vedha Betal. An advance from Mithilesh. 10 million. Ravi. Count it and put it in the car, Muni. Ravi, have we ever counted the cash Vedha gives us? I've ordered something special for you today. Really? You get the best 'kulcha-nihari' here. - I see. - Gajju's famous Dhaba. That's Gajju. Vedha, I hear you've started a new business. You can double the money. Nothing escapes you. The business is called Shatak. He invests money and earns three times its value. Cricket betting? The police are cracking down on gambling. Be careful. Shatak stays away from anything illegal, everything he does is totally legal. Boss...try it. What are you doing? Let me show you. First wrap the bread around the nihari. Then dip it in the gravy three times. One, two, three... Straight into your mouth. Close your eyes and enjoy. What do we say in Kanpur? Delicious! That's what this is. Brother has a point, boss. Ravi, put the money in Vedha's car. Tell Shatak to invest my money, and double it. Shatak, we have our investment! Yes! Brother is flying high! Senseless since dawn. Glowing since dawn Blood flowing since dawn My senses swaying senselessly. Even nomads would lose control I promised not to drink, but drank too much Your eyes are like drops of wine The season has turned Alcoholiya! I dipped my face in wine. The thirsty come swinging by No counting drinks today, but today will count for me Fill those glasses and pass them here I stand at your doorway, longing to see you Fill me with love The season has turned Alcoholiya! Oh those grapes of wine Oh my helpless heart Rob me, but I'll keep smiling Stop drinking! Unbearable thought If the bottle is Laila, the heart is Majnu. So, sing! Alcoholiya, Alcoholiya Pull that towel between your legs and dance! Alcoholiya! Alcoholiya! Drinking turns Lucknow into Mangolia! Don't hesitate Keep dancing Wash shyness away The season has turned... ...Alcoholiya! Alcoholiya! Alcoholiya! Shatak. What is it? It's called the ultimate pleasure, Shatak. Marijuana. It looks like a cigarette on the outside. Filled with the good stuff on the inside. My side business. Big profits. Here. Have a drag. - Brother... - So early in the morning? Bablu, how are things? - Business good? - Absolutely, brother. Thanks to you and to Lord Shiva's grace, I paid last month's 20% on time. - Are you a devotee of Lord Shiva? - Yes. Can I ask you a question about Lord Shiva? Go ahead. The snake around His neck? Why is it there? Is it for Lord Shiva's protection? Or for the snake's? What do you think? Shall I tell you what I think? If the snake slips away from Lord Shiva, will it make any difference to the Lord? What happens to the snake? An eagle or crow will grab it and fly away. The snake will become someone's breakfast. You're right! You're that snake. Treat me as your Lord. You're safe as long as you're wrapped around my neck. So shouldn't my share be at least 50%? - 50%. - 50? 50? I'm making you my partner. Gajju, time to celebrate. Sure. - Bablu... - A celebration! Cheers, partner. Cheers... partner. Have you thought about Parshuram's money? - How will you invest it? - I have a plan... Brother Sanki, where did you keep the money? At Chanda's. - You messed up again. - Why? I'll be right back. Go. Run. Chanda's granny! Want a kulfi? Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! Hello? Brother? The money was taken, I understand... But why take Chanda? It must be the Mumbai gang. Who's the traitor amongst us? Vedha. Why are you hitting me? Why lose your cool? Vedha! Boss, see how he manhandles me in your presence. He took the money. He's rotten. Now he's grabbing my collar. I always knew that he and his young brother... Enough, Vedha. Stop! I don't doubt Ravi. I gave you the money. So you are responsible. Until the money is returned, Ravi will handle MLA Mithilesh's work. Where will we get so much money? If Mithilesh finds out, we're done for. How did it all this happen? All roads are now closed to us. What do we do? Brother, will anyone help us? Brother. It's been two days! Chanda! Chanda, where are you? Shatak. I've been waiting for your call. Where are you? Who abducted you? Who should I name? It was me. When I saw the money, I thought I could make my dreams come true. But when I was on the run, I realised, I was leaving behind my most precious dream. Brother, forget about why she ran, think about what brought her back. Bravo, Vedha! You want to defeat the man who taught you the game. And where did you choose to strike? In brother's house! Ravi! The money's back. Vedha. We thrive on fear. When people hear what that two-bit woman did to us, and that we did nothing, then who'll fear us? If my reign of terror is over, then I'm done. We must stick to the ethics of our trade. You know what our ethics demand. Finish the girl. Vikram sir! Another moral dilemma. What will Vedha do? If he upholds our ethics, Chanda is dead. If she's dead, so is Shatak. If I'm loyal to blood ties, it means turning against Parshuram. What will Vedha choose? Ethics? Or emotion? Let me explain it like you do. Hey... This... Remember the line? This is it. The line of control. This side of the line is good, that side is evil. In the earlier story, both were wrong. But in this story, they're both right. Who will you side with, sir? Parshuram? Or Shatak? Ethics? Or emotion? Parshuram is powerful. And Shatak's only strength is his brother. Rebelling against Parshuram means fighting the world. But Shatak's world is only made up of you and Chanda. If I was in your place, I'd side with Shatak. Because Shatak is innocent. There's goodness in him. You're right, sir. Shatak was innocent. Vedha did as you would have. I chose emotion, too. Sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai. Paid the full price for her actions. Full gang war! I didn't kill Abbas, sir. You want to know why Abbas died? First find out why Shatak was killed. As the law dictates, sir, first investigate, then judge. Don't announce the verdict without investigation, sir. We should know by looking into someone's eyes whether he's a criminal or not. Do you know why we sleep peacefully after every encounter? Because we know we didn't kill an innocent person. This... - Priya... - Don't touch me. Priya, I did what I thought was right at that time. I was just doing...my job. You used me for your job, and you thought that was right. You tapped my phone. Show me. Don't move. I can't figure out if I'm living with my husband, or a police officer. I've warned you once. Now move! Must I do everything for you? The car keys. Where were you, brother? The police have issued orders to shoot on sight. I've made all the arrangements at the Kursi Road warehouse. Go underground immediately. Give me the car keys. I don't know your game, brother. Vikram is not like the other officers. Please be careful. Of all the lawyers in the state, you had to appoint his wife to defend you? Because of her... - Vikram... - That's enough, Mr. Vedha. I'll inform my seniors that I cannot work for you. You've crossed a line. Sometimes for the greater goal you must cross that line. I've been watching you. I've noticed you've been riding on Vikram's back for a while. But why Vikram? There are 285,000 police officers in this state. Why him? I only ask questions of people who can find answers. What are you looking for? What do you want? I once wanted... my aunt to sell poppadums all over the world. And movie stars would wear Sikander's shoes. And Baiju's biryani would sell out. I wanted to help others realise their dreams. Small loan, big smile. He wanted to change me. My younger brother Shatak. He was no criminal, madam. But he was murdered in an encounter. I asked Vikram sir a question. He will be at a loss looking for the answer. That's when he'll need your help. I've sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai. Vedha sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai. Why would they risk their lives by returning? Abbas and Shatak. Their deaths must be connected somehow. We must find out why Shatak died. You guys went after Muni, and found Shatak by coincidence. Sorry, sir. I don't believe in coincidence. Everything has a reason. The enquiry led us to believe Chanda returned to Lucknow for her grandmother's funeral. Right, Vikram? Where are the other photos? Look at this, sir. Ligature marks. Chanda was held captive. She was tied up. It means she was abducted. But why? - Where are Shatak's phone records? - Here, sir. It's clear, sir. The dates match. Shatak landed in Lucknow a day before the encounter. He went looking for Chanda. Vedha was underground. There was only one way of finding Chanda. Shatak had to ask Muni and his gang for help. That's why they were meeting, and the info was leaked to us on purpose. So we'd get there and Shatak would be killed in an encounter. This is no coincidence, sir. We're being used as pawns in someone's game. Hey...who tipped us off about Muni? One of Abbas's guys...Pappu. Yes, sir. This is it. I've done my job. Where can we find Pappu? It's Muni and Raja Babu's memorial service. Next left, sir. Since Vedha went underground, all the mice are out to play. Why is Parshuram here? Sir, Pappu was last seen heading towards the condemned bogies in the railway yard. Let's go. Let's go. Prabhakar, check all the bogies. Pappu has been murdered. The killer must still be in the vicinity. Come on! Someone wants us to not talk to Pappu. You two, over there. Lower your guns! I want him alive. The place is full of people. Who are we looking for? Sir, there's no one here. I'll check the main yard. Find him. He cannot escape. What are we looking for? As if I knew! Your Mother...! Your Mother...! Why is the Mumbai gang after me? Slimeball! How do we get out of here? Who sent you? Bloody Lilliput. Sir... It just went off. He would've killed you. You said we should know by looking into someone's eyes whether he's a criminal or not. - Did I do something wrong, sir? - No. You did the right thing. If you hadn't fired, I would've been fried. - Was that your first kill? - Yes, sir. Tell Prabhakar to complete the formalities. Yes, sir. Priya. Listen to me. Priya. Won't you even look at me? Hear my argument before you announce the verdict. What is your argument? This is not between a cop and a lawyer, it's between you and me. Can I suggest something? From now on, lawyer and cop stay outside the house. Only Vikram and Priya are allowed in. OK? So you won't follow me into the house? No way. OK. - Well? - I said the house, not the bedroom. What's wrong? Can't sleep? Seriously? You said work stays out of our home. Tell me. Priya, I won't beat around the bush. I must talk to Vedha urgently. No wonder you were in a hurry to sweet-talk me. No. That's not it. I don't know where he is. - Priya... - Vikram, I really don't... He'll be at a loss looking for the answer. That's when he'll need your help. So am I a courier service between you two? What? Vedha told me if you're at a loss, I must remind you of... 'Kulcha-nihari'. Why 'kulcha-nihari'? - Thank you, sir! - Take it away carefully. Please, sir. What can I serve you, sir? One 'kulcha-nihari' and Vedha. Yes, sir. Let me show you. First wrap the bread around the nihari. Then dip it into the gravy three times. One, two, three... Straight into your mouth. Close your eyes and enjoy. Sir. Vikram sir, did you enjoy it? I have a gift for you. Get it from shop no. 16, next to Sharma's tea stall. I have a gift for you, too. Who tipped off the Mumbai gang about you, Vedha? I mean the Shivgadh encounter where Shatak died. Do you want to know who tipped us off? It looks like a cigarette on the outside. Filled with good stuff on the inside. Babloo. The Mumbai gang was working for your Babloo. O Man, there is no difference between black and white? It's all perception O Man, good and bad aren't different things The concept of heaven and hell, sin and virtue - all worthless What you've gained, what you've lost, just let it go It's all illusion, just let it go What's right? What is not? Who can figure out these nuances? Who is god here? Tell me Who is without mistakes? Tell me There are stains of crime on you too, just check There is blood on your hands, wash it off if you can What a trap it is! It's all deception, O Man Look for the truth behind the curtains Are you blind, O Man? Vedha and Babloo are in the Old Mill... They're dangerous. Don't risk your life, Vikram. I can't afford to lose another man. Wait outside. I'm coming with backup. Don't worry, sir. I'll deal with them before you get here. Scum! You were the finger! I was 7 years old, I was in short pants when I entered this business. I slogged day and night, hoping to see the fruits of my labour. I saw the fruits. But when they were in my reach, a dirty dog snatched them away. See the irony? I've had to lick that dirty dog's feet. That's when I decided, I would kill you and all your men, one by one. You're going to die. Only after I do. Brother Vedha! Welcome, sir. Was it tough finding me? I liked your gift. Thank you. No mention. Nice, huh? Everyone is having fun. Me with you, you with me. And life is having fun with the pair of us. This is my 20-year-old long friend. Brother Babloo. I even spared the scoundrel's life. You'd be stunned if you heard his story. He has a story, too? You all are so alike. You're all the same. Him. You. No, sir. What are you doing? Don't you want to know why Abbas was killed? No more stories. Tell me straight. A friend dropped his wallet on the street. He came home and looked for it everywhere. I asked him: "What are you doing? "You dropped it on the street, and you're looking for it at home? "You crazy?" He said: "How do I look for it outside? It's so dark there." You need to shift your gaze, sir. Enter the darkness. Meaning? Why was Abbas killed? The answer is in my final story, sir. Listen patiently and carefully. This time you won't just enjoy it, it'll astound you! "Thief. Police." In the war, Parshuram was the king and his elephant was Mithilesh Tiwari. I got the audition. What if I get rejected? No one could ever reject you. Look! You're a lefty, aren't you? You eat with your left hand. That's it! She's a born star. You're right. See. This is my love story. I'll need another piece. It's all my fault. What is? I forced you into this gang war, otherwise... A wise man never cries over spilt milk. He curdles it into cheese and eats it. Did you think I could work for a man like Parshuram forever? Why don't you move to Mumbai and start a business? You promised me. Remember? OK. Don't sulk. It's time to go. How could I've known it was the last time I'd see my Shatak and Chanda. There's a new twist in Lucknow's mafia story. AK47. We need something to challenge his AK47. We'll find something. I'll create a gangster greater than he is, or my name isn't Babloo. The people of Lucknow live under the trauma of gang war. The police have created a special task force to deal with the problem. The team leader is SSP Abbas. And in their team, they have brought in an encounter specialist, SSP Vikram. I'm a big shot now! I'll have to escape to London or somewhere. Who's that? The police. Hey... No, no... Kill me! Just imagine they killed Kallu. He was too young to die. We're a target. You must go underground, Vedha. You stupid? I say we go with all guns blazing, and take revenge. They kill 4, we kill 40. Stop provoking him. One of our boys was killed. The cops should've shot you instead. Always provoking him. Can I say something? We've seen enough wins and losses. Been on the run for too long. Time to stop. You should take Shatak's advice and move to Mumbai. - You'd send me there alone? - Not alone! You go first, I'll be close behind. Bloody scum! - Where is Vedha? - You said he was in the car. He was. He's escaped again. Five million. These scumbags have brought an AK47 from Mumbai. But I was true to my word. Look, Sanki! I got a rogue cop of my own. Slaughtered them like swine. Abbas sir, only Vedha is left. I'll tip you off. You kill him. Double the money. Yes, sir. Your friend. Abbas. Good...evil. Police...criminal. Truth...lies. You love drawing lines, right? Now which side are you on? On that side, or this? Or is the line no longer visible? It's turned into a circle. We're all going around in circles. Round and round. What do you think? You'd tell me stories and I'd believe you. Abbas was taking money from Babloo to carry out encounters. Do you know how long I've known Abbas? Do I look stupid to you? Vikram sir. Blinkers cover a horse's eyes, so it cannot see left or right. Blinkers covered your eyes. Abbas's son was ill. How much was the treatment? How did Abbas pay? With his police salary? The blinkers are slipping. No. If that was true, then Abbas... Abbas would come to me. How could he, sir? Your honesty scares everyone. Abbas. He's dead, sir. If Abbas was working for Babloo, then why did Babloo kill him? He didn't kill Abbas, sir. Then who did? I had to first find out why Shatak died. And I've found that out, sir. Abbas is your riddle. You solve it. How could you let Vedha go? You fell for his nonsense. What do you think? The illiterate Babloo masterminded this whole game? There's one thing I don't understand, sir. If Babloo didn't kill Abbas, who did? Abbas came here to meet Chanda about the drug deal. They argued about something. Shots were fired from both sides. Abbas died at Chanda's hands, right? Maybe we're seeing things from the wrong angle, sir. The son must pay for the father's sins. Abbas was aware of his crimes. He thought his son was paying for his sins. And even on that day he couldn't shoot Shatak. Because he knew Shatak was innocent. Abbas didn't come here to meet Chanda, he came here to rescue her. To atone for his sins. The Mumbai gang held Chanda. Right here. This is where she was tortured. They heard this sound. And started shooting from over there. Chanda! Vikram! Chanda didn't know that Abbas had come to save her. Maybe she shot him out of fear, or maybe to avenge Shatak. Forensics have confirmed the bullet that killed Abbas was fired from Chanda's gun. Blinkers cover a horse's eyes, so it cannot see left or right. Blinkers covered your eyes. Abbas's son was ill. How much was the treatment? How did Abbas pay? With his police salary? The blinkers are slipping. Giri, you had a grand wedding for your sister. Ranjan, new bike, single payment. Ansari. Your son's annual school fees are 150,000. You're a good father. And you two. You're good sons. Martin and Anthony. You paid off your father's loan. Prabhakar! You take 14 days casual leave, but never miss visiting the red-light district. You have expensive taste. Head constable. You bet 200,000 on a sixer? Where did you get so much cash? And you, sir. Your ruins, sorry, your ancestral mansion. You must return it to its former glory, sir. My eyes were wide open, but I could not see. I've killed people, framed them by planting guns on them. But you forgot that the devil is in the detail. You placed the gun in Chanda's right hand, sir. That was a small mistake. Chanda was left-handed. You're a lefty, aren't you? You eat with your left hand. That's it! She's a born star. We made no mistakes, Vikram. We did our duty by killing them. Drawing salaries from two places. What use is the department's salary, Vikram? Your father died in the line of duty. What did he get? A medal and a bike. Is that what he left you? It was a simple plan. We'll abduct Chanda. Shatak will come to free her. We'll kill Shatak. Vedha will come out of hiding to avenge Shatak's death. We'll kill him and collect our money from Babloo. But suddenly Abbas developed a conscience. He decided he didn't want to be any part of it. He became a threat. He would've taken us all down. We had to silence him. We've carried out 18 encounters, sir. But I always believed justice was on our side. Where's the line that separates us from them? What's the difference between us and them? Right and wrong? Police...criminal! You've turned it all to dust. Sir. Drop your guns. Drop them! Drop it. Drop it. Kick them away. And move back. Anthony. Back. Sir. Deepak, give me cover. Sir. - Deepak, cover me. - Yes, sir. Move back. Deepak... Move back! Pick up your guns. Don't let him escape. Seal all the exits. Go, go, go! Bloody hell! He doesn't have a gun. Don't kill them! Let's kill this one, sir. Sir, I haven't done anything. - I was only following orders. - You're not a full-fledged cop yet, but already a criminal. It's tough killing your colleagues, isn't it? Trigger or finger. I have no doubts, sir. You killed the IG, sir. That's serious. I know a lawyer. Priya madam. Shall I give you her number? She'll never defend me. I'll put in a good word. Love marriage? One often faces such problems in love marriages, sir. I have a solution. My own love story. - Do you want to hear it? - Enough! No more stories. Sure? Look at these two, Vikram sir. They could never be honest. Not to their own people. Or to their profession. All their lives they've chased greed and illusions. People forget. You're born empty-handed, you die empty-handed. Born from the earth. Only to go back into the earth. Lying there like cockroaches. What did I gain, sir? Balls! Life is a joke, sir. Yes! Police. Vedha sir, now you tell me, what should Vikram do? Should he let Vedha go? Spare Vedha because he saved his life and fought alongside him? Or should he kill Vedha? Because Vedha is a criminal who has murdered 16 men. Another dilemma. What should Vikram do?
