Well. No. Do it again. Very good. Exquisitely worked. You've crafted a jewel, my boy. Perfect for a courtesan or priest... to pluck after supper In other words... this violin will never bear my name. Put your anger into your work, my boy. Stay with me and learn. Madame? - Cesca, can you still see the future? - Are you all right? Sit down. Did you call me? I was in the garden. - I can come here, can't I? - Of course. - This is part of my house. - Of course, Madame. I have some new amulets and bones for you. If your husband spits on them, it will help. Are you hungry? - Don't eat that, it's fish. - So? Your child will be slow to learn. There it is. I also have some stones for you, and a key... - ...to wear around your neck. - My husband is tired of spitting. Spitting's what men are good for. A father's saliva is the best thing he can give. Cesca, tell me my child's future. - I can't do that. - Don't worry about my husband. No, it's not your husband... I'm simply not able to do it. I see. Until the baby is born, your humors are one. However... - ...I can read your future. - No, I told you, I'm scared. Come on, Madame. Five cards. It's only the future. What if it's bad? I'll pretend not to see it. Tell me everything. The Moon. You'll live a long life, full and rich. There's... a travel ahead. I see a long journey. Nicolo. Leave us. Close the door. What is it? Why do you come here in your condition? - I know I'll find you here. - What is it? - I talked to Cesca. - And? - She read my future. - Cesca! Dear God! And the birth, she said, will be very difficult and painful. They always are. This is no prediction! - We are talking about me! - Why do you listen to Cesca? She is our servant. I have an excellent midwife, an astrologer, a doctor. They'll all be there. It will be perfect. I know. - How do you know? - I know. Nicolo... I'm so old to be having a baby. This is a violin. - It's different. - I still have to varnish it. - But there's something... - It's perfect. Everything else is just junk, worthy of a peddler or the trash heap. But this is my masterpiece. I made it for our son, Anna. Our son will be a musician. He'll live for music. He'll bring us pride... and beauty to the world, my love. - Nicolo... - I wanted to... to surprise you, but you see, I can also make predictions. It's too big for a baby. He'll grow. - My child will come in the full moon. - Come to bed. You're jealous of our relationship. Me and the moon. No, I'm not jealous. I know you'll come back. Master, a boy is asking for you. - Tell him to go away. - The doctor sent him. I think you'd better come. - Your wife, Sir... The doctor... - What is it? She's not well. She's having the baby. Get out. Get out! Leave me alone, for God's sake! You must clean the violin every day. Care for it well. This is your violin for as long as you're with us at the orphanage. Well... a curse hangs over you, Madame. Danger to those who come under your thrall. And there will be many... many. It is a powerful card, the Hanged Man. I see danger... infirmity and disease. I'm sorry, but what kind I can't say. There are many kinds of sickness. These roads, Brother Christoph! You've no idea what I've endured. And why such haste? What is so urgent that it couldn't wait until my next visit? - We have a boy, Sir. - You have many boys! This boy is a miracle. You'll see. Vienna swarms with miracles. Not like him. We felt you should see him at once. - Does he speak French? - No, Sir. Unfortunately. All your students should learn French. It's the language of music. It hones the ear and elevates the mind! Monsieur Poussin, this is Kaspar Weiss. What violin is this? I haven't seen it before. - We've had it for 100 years. - Far too big for him. Look at his hands. He should play on a child's violin. Even Mozart... God rest his soul... played in Versailles on a child's violin. No shame in that. Wouldn't you like a smaller instrument? He seems to manage. Let him try. Play, my boy. Play. I see. Monsieur Poussin? We're prepared to offer a small sum... to help him in his study. They say you're a good boy... well-mannered and clean. Glad to hear it. But you don't like vegetables. Is that so? - Yes, Sir. - What don't you like? Carrots, Sir. And beans and cabbage and... These monks can't cook. They also write you've got a weak heart. Is that so? You must have a strong heart to play violin. Believe me. And stronger still to live in Vienna. You shall see. Vienna is an infuriating city. Infuriating, but magnificent. Magnificent... this city! Antoinette! May I present to you... Kaspar Weiss. One of the most gifted children on Earth. But Georges, we can't... My wife, Antoinette Poussin. Good afternoon, Kaspar. How nice to meet you. Go on in. I'll show you your room in a minute. Georges, please! We can't afford to keep him! We can't afford not to. There's something about your playing that eludes me. I've decided to analyze it, logically, with a scientific method. First, your bowing... and your left hand phrasing. Your d?tach?, ornamentation and your taste. And theory! Theory, too, is important. You need a lot more than inspiration to play the violin. You need method. You must think... - ...and work! - Won't you eat? - You must eat! - Do you want something else? Try this cheese. I think you'll like it. It's French. - Try some. - Taste it. You'll see, a little different from the monk's crumbly cheese! Go on. Kaspar, if you play well, you'll enjoy the finest fare. We can't afford coal, let alone food! Sell your jewelry! Sell your David! He voted to behead the king, the monster! My boy... play well, and there will be cheese. Violin... cheese. - May I go to my room now? - Go ahead. And sleep well. Madame Poussin will assist you in your prayers. Why speak French? He doesn't understand. So he'll learn! I want them to know who taught him. Good morning, Poussin. I pride myself on visiting the Taufer Orphanage three times a year... to offer my services as a teacher, as a gesture of support... for those good men of the cloth. This year, they called early. I was skeptical, but... when this child raised his bow... when he played his first note, well, Baron von Spielmann... I knew my prayers had been answered. You've unearthed another "Wunderkind". I've got no money for you, Poussin. I have no concerts to offer you. - It isn't for the money. - I suggest you find another patron. - Must I beg? - Isn't that what you're doing? Yes. I am. In three weeks... I'm holding a private audition at my salon. Prince Mannsfeld is leaving for Prussia... and seeks a prodigy to accompany him. He must hear this boy. Three weeks. Can you be ready? Truthfully! - I could be ready tomorrow. - Be very certain, Poussin. - If you embarrass me again... - I've charmed the crowned heads... Where are those heads now? Rolling in the gutters of the new Republic! No, no, no! The first phrase, the entire section, must be played staccato. A modern style, well and good, but let's not be crude. - You liked it, didn't you? - Yes. I'm delighted. You're going to play it again. You're going to play it again and again and again. See this? It's a clockwork chronometer, of my invention. It's called the Poussin-meter. You will heed it with the same deference you would me. What you just played corresponds to a tempo like this. Each day, as we progress... we shall push down this little ball notch. Until finally, in three weeks, you'll be playing like this. The world will be yours! You see, Antoinette, there's something I still don't understand. His violin has a wonderful sound, and a lovely form. - Of course, it's Italian. - Is it very valuable? - Why do you ask? - Well, it could pay the rent, if ever... He will play divinely, my dear. - Can't you trust me? - Of course I can. But must he sleep with it? He could roll over on it. What? He sleeps with it? Straight, proud. Lift your chin. There. Perfect, your bow. You're clutching. Your body's stiff, your elbow locked. I knew something was holding you back. Something, but I didn't know what. Now it's totally clear. You're oppressed by your violin. It has you completely enslaved. Look at you. There, very good. If you want to advance, Kaspar Weiss, you must let go. What do you mean, Sir? I don't understand. Antoinette tells me you sleep with your violin. Tonight you'll sleep by yourself. Without the violin. Without your violin! Doctor! Thank you for coming so quickly. Thank you so much, Doctor. Good night. - Feeling better? - Yes, thank you. The doctor says your heart must have stopped for a minute. I'm sorry. It's all right, but we don't want it to happen again. Were you worried? Were you nervous about the audition? It will be just fine. You know that, don't you? - Georges! - I know, I know. Kaspar, we want to tell you... you don't have to do it if you don't want to. - You don't have to play. - I don't? We can cancel the audition. We'll manage, somehow. It's better than making you sick, see? You don't have to be famous. No? Yes... Oui. Sorry... malade. I want to be famous. Sir, I really do. That's my boy! I'm very proud of you. I want you to rest, relax. Madame Poussin will bring a visitor you like very much. Merci, Madame. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Good! Good! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Go on! There you go. Amen. We better sleep now. Tomorrow's going to be a busy day. Perfect. And now, backwards. Are you ready? Rejected! The shame! Kaspar Weiss. Kaspar Weiss, violin! Play the best you can, Kaspar. Play your best. Master Poussin and his prot?g?, Kaspar Weiss. Closer. Come closer. So you're the wild child I've heard all about. An orphan raised by monks. If you prefer, we can call in the next. - There's the son of... - No, no. How charming to think a monastery has actually produced something... something worthwhile. That's a lovely instrument you have. May I see it? May I see it, my boy? Please. Is it for sale? I'd give you a good price for it. - He's very attached to his instrument. - So I see. - Perhaps after he's played... - Of course, let him play. I might take him too. Come, play for me. Won't you play something for me? Please. Poussin! Just play for him, son. Play. Monsieur Poussin? On behalf of the brothers I thank you... for the generosity you showed Kaspar. He takes with him the many gifts you gave him. I did what I could. Would you honor us by sharing our modest supper? It's very kind of you, but... my wife awaits me, all of Vienna awaits me. Of course, we understand. - I do have one question. - Yes? - The violin. - Yes? What will become of it? I'm sorry, I thought you knew. Naturally you were foremost in our thoughts. After all the time and energy you invested... it would be wrong to give it to another child. - Yes, of course. - So we buried it with the boy. He can play it in heaven. Yes, quite right. And... and then I see a time of life... a time of lust and energy... loosed across mountains and oceans, and time. Confusing, Madame, I know. But I see it. I'm certain. Yours is a Lazarus soul. Yes, I see. Well, put her through when you can. We're on hold. You should tell her our story. Explain its past. Brother, please, she doesn't care. She's doing her job. But if you convince her... - Father Viktor, good morning. - Good morning. This is Suzanne. They're just closing lot 71. Can you hear the auctioneer? Sold to the lady on my left. Yes, I can hear him. Suzanne, how do I tell you when I want to... Leave it to me, Sir. Just tell me when you want to stop. ...a masterpiece of the Golden Age. If she would give us the pleasure. I feel helpless. Isn't there something we can do? Yes. We can pray. This time the last order bid is at US$ 250,000. Let's open the floor. Who will start us off? US$ 260,000. Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky. US$ 270,000. Suzanne, on the telephone. US$ 280,000. Back to you, Sir. US$ 300,000. I see you, Suzanne. And then... a man comes into your life. A handsome man... and intelligent. He'll seduce you with his talent... and worse. In short... he's the Devil. Darling, come here. Do you like it? Justice. There will be a trial, a great trial... before a powerful magistrate. And you, you will be guilty. Beware! Beware of the heat of the fire! Comrade Chan Gong has come from Beijing. Welcome her, please. Comrades, students, revolutionary companions-in-arms... I give you my proletarian salute! I congratulate you on today's grand festival... for which you have worked so hard. Your cultural unit has done exceptional work. I would also like to commend you on the children's presentation. It made my heart rejoice. The story of "The Three Heroic Girls" was a vivid lesson. It galvanized our historic crusade! But some efforts are less successful... unfortunately. Sometimes the teacher must learn from his students. Give it to me. Capitalist exploitation survived for centuries... yet its "classics" are pitiful! Foreign music is meaningless and empty. What do they mean by "symphony", "concerto No. 1, No.2, No. 3"? This is empty formalism. It speaks nothing to the people. What good is making music... except to teach and inspire the people? - Long live Chairman Mao! - Long live Chairman Mao! - Overthrow the cultural establishment! - Overthrow the cultural establishment! - Chou Yuan! - Present. Why do you teach this instrument? Comrade Chan Gong, what you say is true... Louder, please. Comrade Chan Gong, you are right. Much of western music is unrefined, worthless. This is a fact. Everything you said is true, but the music I teach... Go on! The music I teach is revolutionary music. - Beethoven, Prokofiev... - Do you think so? In his speech, Comrade Li said... Comrade Li was purged and humiliated. Do you still want to quote him? I didn't know. - I have taught for many years... - That is apparent. We believe in the rule of many voices. - What should we do here? - Throw away that old junk! Chou Yuan, just admit your guilt! Let's challenge degenerate Western art! Comrade, may I say a few words? Of course. Students, comrades, revolutionary Red Guards... I'm not an authority on foreign music. I have not studied like Comrade Chan Gong. But in my opinion... there's nothing as beautiful as our traditional music. Chou Yuan also teaches the hu chin. Could he not focus on that? Comrade Xiang has shown her wisdom. Put this down with the other "great olds"! To every problem there is a solution! I'm sure you can discover the problems. And I'm sure you can solve them. Who is it? Who's there? Ming! You scared me. I didn't hear you. It's a mess. I was tidying up. What's that? This is a violin... a musical instrument from Europe. From Europe? Is it a bad thing? No. A violin itself is a good thing. Here. Take a look. We have to study foreign music so we can move on... - ...as Chairman Mao said. - Dad asked if you're coming. - He's waiting. - Yes, tell him I'll come right away. As soon as I finish my work. - Ming? - Yes? What you see here... don't tell anyone. I want you to listen. This will be our secret, all right? Go. Ming? Ming! - Was she home? - Yes. - Is she coming? - No. She said she'd meet you. - What? Is she coming or not? - I can't say. - Why not? - I promised her to keep it secret. What are you saying? I'm your father. You must tell me everything. Papa, wait! - Xiang Pei? - Papa, don't! Xiang Pei, open up! It's me! Where is the key? Go. Quiet! Where is she? Water! Water! She's gone! Is this her? Look at the date: 1937. It must be her mother. Chou Yuan! - What do you want? - Please let me in. - I've done nothing. - Let me inside. - This is for you. - I don't want it. It's for you. Take it. It's a violin. - A violin. - I remember. Do you want it or not? I'm an old man, but I'm not a fool. Where are your comrades? - Are they waiting outside? - This isn't a trap. I've changed. I don't need it now. - I speak from my heart. - Enough! And I don't need this. It's from another time. If you want it, you can have it... or else no one will. Do you want it or not? I've no time! No more arguments! Take it. I am a cadre in the Party, do you understand? I can't keep it. I love the people. Do you understand? Xiang Pei! I will keep it safe. - Let's go eat. I'm starving. - Go ahead. I'll wait here. - I'm sure she'll be back. - Let's go, you all! US$ 1,950 million. And... sold to the lady on the left. The last sale of the evening, lot number 72 on the turntable there... and star of the night... Where is she? The last violin of Nicolo Bussotti, 1681. - A masterpiece of the Golden Age. - Do you see it? - No, not yet. - If she will give us the pleasure. And here she is now, lot number 72, the so-called "Red Violin". - It's not how I remember it. - They've cleaned it up. It's better. US$ 260,000. Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky. - US$ 270,000. Suzanne on the phone. - Maybe if I heard it again. US$ 280,000. Back to you, Sir. US$ 300,000 at the back of the hall. US$ 320,000. Suzanne, I see you. 340, I have you. 380, Mr. Ruselsky. The last card. The last card. - Oh my God! - Courage, Madame. Upside down. At this point in the spread, it might be good news. I feel... I feel the fast air sweeping around you... carrying you, furious wind... and then stopping. Your journey will end. No question. I see it. One way or another, your travels are over. And there is trouble in this, like always. But you... you are strong by now... strong like a tree in the forest. Where is he? Upstairs. You are not alone. A crowd of faces... friends and family, enemies, lovers. You will attract many admirers... fighting to win your hand. And money! Lots of money! No, Madame. Don't be afraid. In this card I see... a rebirth. Madame? Are you all right? Is everything all right? Yes, I'm sorry. You have the visions. No. I'd better go now. My husband. Of course. Go to your husband. Thanks, Cesca.
