Nivi! Check if your father has come! [tires screeching] I have got gifts for both of you. -A gift? -Jump! -Guess what the gift is? -Let's see -Guess what the surprise could be! -Hey! -Say something. -Barbie girl! Wow! -Only for you? -Hold it! Your favorite barbie girl. -See that! -Go, play! Only she gets barbie doll? And Vijay, for you... Dad! What's this? Hey son! -Please, give it back! -What? Very precious gift. My friend gifted it. It's 700 years old! Am worried he will break it. Please be careful. Hey Benny! You haven't changed one bit? Certain things are hard to get. We have got something. So let's keep it. Hey careful! Hey start recording! Dad, look here. [singing old Tamil movie song] Mom, say something. Hey, you're going to break it! Why have you cooked non-veg on full moon? Chicken. Mutton. What's this? Well that is for you... -Dad, look at the camera and talk. -Hey! Hey, why don't you tell him? -I've been calling since long for dinner! -What do I do? -Look! -Hey come! Turn the camera off! -Dad, just some more time. -Vijay! Turn the camera off. Tell him! Vijay! Come here! -Daddy, tell me a story please! -A story? What story shall I tell you? Alright! I'll tell you that elephant story. Once upon a time there was a big elephant! Dad, I don't want this. Tell me something interesting. What interesting story shall I tell you? Come. Dad, I hear that some ghost comes around and plays basketball. My friend, Krishna was telling me. Hey! Why talk about ghosts at night? Keep Quiet! Looks like your mom is scared of ghost stories at night? Well then, am going to tell a ghost story. Some 20 years back.. Daddy was studying 11th or 12th grade. There was a big basket ball tournament! In that basket ball tournament.. We had already scored 9 points and playing.. Opponents were at a lead of 23 points! In the opponent team.. There was a player named Sam. He was a state-level player! His game play was superb! He was playing all good... He fell down all of a sudden, and starting having seizures. Match was stopped. He was taken to hospital. And.. In about 3 months... He passed away. Many people said they could see Sam in the play ground. I was very shocked. After a while, some one said.. They saw something.. After 12 AM... That guy came... to that basket ball court. He was playing basket ball all alone. That basket ball sound went... [making basketball dribbling sound] [making basketball dribbling sound] [making basketball dribbling sound] [basketball dribbling sound] Many say they heard it! That... Daddy hasn't seen it. But I've heard about it. See, don't believe all this. Ghosts don't exist. Okay? Daddy, my friend told me that you pushed him. Who said that? Nothing like that happened. Look, give it to me! Time's up! Give it. Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Lie down.. Do ghosts exists or not? For centuries.. This has been one of the most unanswerable questions. Today with us, we have.. 4 special guests. "Ghosts don't exist.." "This has become a thing" "These are things used by frauds" This is what, a rationalist.. Mr. Durai here has to say and also... It is said books are a treasure of knowledge. Today we have a librarian... Mr. Rajendran who handles the very treasure of those books. We also have Kayal... ...who has done lot of new things in the field of software. "Ghosts exist. I communicate and live among them" says exorcist Vajravelu who's with us today. Let's start our discussion with Mr. Vajravelu first. You keep saying that ghosts exist. What evidence do you have, to prove that ghosts exist? Sir, I have performed over 500 exorcisms. Isn't that enough evidence? Sir, you see.. There are 4 people in this debate. But among us there are some supernatural beings as well. If I say this, no atheists will believe me. Mr. Durai, you talk a lot about Rationalism.. Vajravelu says there are supernatural beings over here. -What's your take? -You see. These are stone-age fictions! Like there is no God, there are no ghosts either. In this modern-age, the whole world is within our mobile phones! In a time like this, you are seeding age-old fiction. Mentally challenged people.. Are beaten, tortured.. And tormented by him. He calls it exorcism. Mr. Exorcist.. He's accusing you of only beating and torturing mentally challenged people. One should never mock age-old practices in the name of being modern. I'll tell you all something. About 4000 years back.. There was a mummy idol made by a Queen in Egypt. Have you heard of it? When the queen's empire was surrounded by her enemies.. When the city was about to be destroyed.. She put all of the negative energy surrounding the empire into that idol. It's no normal idol. It has the capability to bring out every single single spirit every full moon Many books have been published on this in many countries. Africa, Thailand, Indonesia.Even the so called developed country, China. Now, they say that idol is in India. What do you say? Maybe you can make a great web-series out of this. Vajravelu is a good story teller. Whole world has gone digital. That's what Mr.Durai says. But Kayal says that it's possible to communicate with ghosts digitally. An app.. Which you say, you have developed to communicate with ghosts. Can you please explain? In my opinion.. There's a frequency difference between humans and ghosts. I mean, sound waves. We can't hear all sounds. Only sounds of certain frequency wavelengths are audible to humans. Any sound, above or below that frequency will not be audible to us. Bats, for example. We can't hear all the sounds they make. Similarly.. To communicate with ghosts.. Only if we can get to that frequency. That's what I have tried to do with this app. Simply put.. This app is a digitized version of Ouija Board. What nonsense is this? Was mobile phone invented to speak with ghosts? Is this even believable? Can you prove any of this now? Sure sir, but as I said earlier.. It's only 95% complete. It's still in testing stage. So test it and show us! Prove it in front of the people. Okay, But there are some conditions. They should also wish to communicate with us. Their aura should be around us. See my son, Lenin.. Passed away 2 years back in a bike accident. Make him come if you can. Let's see. Right here.. Within a 10 meter radius.. If your son's spirit is there, we surely can talk to him. Okay, let's give it a try. Lenin! Lenin! Lenin, if you're here you can talk to your father. Lenin? Are you here? What are you going to say now? Are you going say, that my son is not willing to talk to me? You see.. Not just here.. There's no such thing as ghost anywhere in the world. Why despite being educated, you want to cheat people like this? In India.. God and ghosts have a great scope for business. I have no need to cheat anyone, Sir! Look here! Okay okay. Please don't get emotional Kayal. We will discuss further. This is not intended to hurt anyone. Librarian is here. Let's talk to him. Sir, a lot of books.. You must have come across about ghosts. You must have had lot of experiences. you must have heard a lot. What are your views on ghosts? God. Ghost. I think humans haven't found anything about both. Even now, in this world.. There are many unsolved supernatural events. Those days they saw ghosts through betel leaf and dye. There after they used Ouija Board and said that they spoke with ghosts. I feel the same way about that app which Kayal has developed. So you say science is the ultimate method to get solutions. It's justified. Science has solved many things. Hopefully it will solve this too. -I thank all 4 of you for coming here. -Thank you. Thank you. We will meet again soon. Greetings! Lenin! Hi Kayal! -Hi Sir! -I heard your research has come out well. My best wishes. -Thank sir. At least you.. -Am not saying I believe you. But I appreciate the effort you have put in to develop the app. -So -Hey, you see.. Please don't think I hurt you. I oppose you because what you're saying is unbelievable. Maybe your parents will believe you... Maybe your boyfriend would for the love they have. But don't expect others to believe. Believe me, sir. I'll take care of Kayal. The basic principle of our department is... to not believe even ourselves. Nalan! I am not against love. At the same time.. My sister.. Should have relationship with someone who is worthy of her, right? Definitely. You own a restaurant right? Yes sir. Partnership? No sir. I'm the owner. Own money? Bank loan, sir. Loan. EMI? How many years? 20 years. 20 long years. My sister has.. Given surety for your bank loan? Yeah. Life full of installments. And then love? Shall we speak practically? Hmm Suppose.. If you were in my position.. Will you let your sister marry someone who's in debt? You won't right? Cheque. Tell me! Pathetic. Already in debt. I will pay my own bill. In your restaurant.. You do get tips right? That's what your life depends on. Do you share it? Or does everyone take what belongs to them? I didn't mean to insult you. Just for information. -Hi! -Hi Prem! -How're you? -Fine. -How was your day? -Good. Good. Nalan! Aravind. Hi! Leading fashion designer. And, uh.. He's going to marry my sister. By the way. What do you do? Poor fellow, paying off loans! He will tell you who I am. If you want to know better.. Ask his sister. She'll tell you in detail. Isn't it? Call Nalan. [voice assistant]: Calling Nalan Sir, while you were placing the order I informed you that it would delay I just checked sir everyone is busy but it is getting ready Sir -How many times will you say "more time"? -No sir. -Sir! Some more time. -Don't give me reasons. -It's getting ready sir. -That's what I asked first. How much more time? You said 10 minutes. Now you say another 10 minutes! -I have been waiting for 20 minutes -I understand sir, it will be ready soon -I have a meeting. -Extremely sorry sir. This has never happened! Just 5 minutes sir. I will get the dish ready. Sir, 5 minutes sir. Why 5 more minutes? What's the problem? He is angry because his order got a bit delayed. Sorry for the inconvenience. Tell me. Sir, who are you? I'm the restaurant owner. Sir, ask him yourself. I asked him while placing the order. He said 10 minutes. It's more than 20 minutes. I have a meeting, Sir! You don't even know how to handle a customer! Sorry sir, what did you order? Sizzler's chicken. Sir, usually sizzling chicken is marinated in sauce. Take some time, sir. How can you say this again? Sir. At times, for certain tasty dishes.. It does take some time, Sir. Sir, what are you even talking about? Tour him the kitchen Let him know by himself -What? -What's that, Sir? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sorry sir, sorry sir. I am here, With your order Sizzling chicken Sir Enjoy your food, sir! Hey! What are you doing with the customer.. Let's go Hey come. Let's go. Come on man. -Enjoy your food, sir. -What's with you? What happened to you, Nalan? You never talk like this to anyone? I have never seen you irritated with the customer. What did her brother say? Did he approve or not? Showing off he's a police man? Everyone is annoying me. Did you talk to Kayal? What did she say? -She is buzzing me now -Attend her call I don't want to... Why again and again? Until you attend her call would you get to know what she has to say Go and check the status of the oven Table no.5, order has not yet been served? Look at the way he has chopped it! Good to know You are going to elope and marry Did he annoyed you so much? I am going to chop her brother into pieces, pieces... [assistant chef]: Boss -Ah -Nalan, be careful Oh god! Can't you be more careful? Sorry boss! Sorry boss! Hey sweet-ball! Do you have any sense? -As if you are running for life? -What's so urgent? Just that someone left this toy. Why can't you keep it on the rack? Why do you do this? -Hey! Get that First Aid kit. -What toy is that? Don't know. But looks like some pencil box. Looks very weird! Yes it is! Give me that Hey! Place it back on the rack -Give me the first aid kit -Okay Brother I definitely turned off the lights and locked the doors. But I closed the gas too along with the others! What's going on?

The other day, Yogi too got scoldings Are you pointing at me? The reason was him When I asked to check the customers rather checking the phone He handed over the phone to me. And got scoldings from Sir. For his mistakes I am bearing the brunt, Subhi. Check this, how he has cleaned this plate Look at the corners, why don't you clean it properly?

Sir, shall I leave? Go. We watched everything in the surveillance camera. -Hello Dhamu Bro. -Yes Nalan. Brother, why suddenly boss told to fix surveillance camera?

[deafening noise] [screaming] [deafening noise] [screaming] [deafening noise] [screaming loudly] Brother, turn off the sound [deafening noise continues] [no voice] [deafening noise continues] His neck was strangled. His head was also injured. He used drugs too. Only reports can confirm the cause of death. Ah! Doctor! It's paining Doctor! Two more days and your pain will reduce. Okay? What happened Nalan? Where is brother Dhamu? They say it'll take three days to even find out what happened to Brother Dhamu! He is still in ICU. Sir, bill! Hey! Just like Veera, you murdered Aravind! And you think you can escape? I'll beat you so bad that you will tell me all the truth. You can't escape. Let's go to the station! Is this the best you can do, huh? I went there. I spoke with Aravind. You murdered him as well! You say, you didn't? You say, you didn't? Motive is clear Aravind was someone I had chosen for my sister! Do you have a warrant? [mobile ringing] -You haven't got it, right? -Hello Tell me Okay. Okay. You have no idea what to do, huh? Get the warrant. I will be here. Sir. sir. The report has come. It's been declared as suicide. Hey! Get lost! You want to see warrant, right? An encounter is what you deserve! Your death will be by my hands! Gathering what my brother said. Am scared something will happen to you. Can you at least tell me now, what happened there? That night when I went to his place.. [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming] Aravind... Aravind... That's not all. I saw something in the kitchen. A young girl But the way she looked at me.. Don't know how to put it. Kayal! Nalan, oh my god! I can't open it, Nalan! Nalan! Nalan, can you hear me? Nalan, I cant hear you. Nalan, I'm unable to open the door! Try from that side There... Hey! Hey! Look back! What are you saying? Unable to hear anything. Kayal! Turn back and see! -Look at me. -What? Turn back and look! See there! Is anybody there? Please respond. Kayal! Who are you? What do you want? Leave this place. Sir! You've got visitors. I asked them to come. Ask them to be seated. Because of this incident.. Am afraid I will just lose everything. I can understand your problem, Nalan. But, every problem has a solution What did the police say? Sir, it's my brother who's investigating the case. He strongly believes that Nalan is behind those two murders. That's always how a police officer thinks. May I say something? Whoever comes here.. We arrange books in such a way that its easy for others to read. But whoever reads. Just put it back as they wish. That's more or less of what your situation is. Someone somewhere scattered everything. And you are bound to put it back together. Let's take reading a novel for example.. A young girl has died.. I think she was murdered and now she is taking her revenge Okay sir. But... How is Nalan related to this? Why should he suffer? What if Nalan is the murderer? Sir Sorry Nalan. Just an assumption. Every problem has a beginning. Isn't it possible because it started with you or maybe you are a major link? Sir A shopkeeper in our area told me that before I moved here there is a famous sweat shop in the place. Do you remember that shop's name? That shop name is... That girl.. Mithra. Mithra. Both of you come. Hello viewers! Today the place we are going to see is Catch me with Kitchen... A busy place in a busy city So you ask what's so special about this place? Mithra. Mithra Sweets. Whoever likes Desserts, Mithra sweets will be among their favorites Now I am in front of the store. Let's go in. Sir, please pause! 2 of them are dead Nalan, there is a third person in this photo! Sir! Zoom this please. Let's see. Face is not registered anywhere. Why did they come to this sweet shop? What if Mithra's next target is this person? If this place is so busy, the sole reason is Mithra Sweets. Share us the success secret I don't know what to say. We never expected that it would become so big. My daughter is the sole reason. We stay nearby in Gokulam Apartment, Peoples are very supportive there So if we go to that apartment.. We might get the detail about her Correct Who are you sir? Who do you want to meet? No, I came looking for Rani ma'am who was running the sweet shop. Am her distant relative. I have come from her home town. They have vacated sir! We don't know where they are now. Where is the flat they lived in? Is anybody in there? Why are you asking all that? -We've come from so far. Please help us! -Velu, open the gate. -Sir! -There is no water in the tank! -Turn on the motor. -Okay sir. Who's this? Who have they come to visit? -Rani.. -Sir here... Rani and Mithra who were here. We are their relatives We have come to meet them. Rani. Mithra They don't live here anymore. Do you know where they have moved? I heard Mithra died in a cylinder blast in their shop. Unable to bear the loss, her mother became unstable. No idea where they went. Went mad? Does anyone know anything else about them? If we could meet Rani.. We thought of taking her back to hometown. This is an apartment. People don't notice what others are doing. I'm the apartment secretary. Half of these people don't even know me! You see.. Phones in their hands and earphones in their ears. Nobody cares for the other person. Whole country is ruined. That's it, right? Want to know anything more? Thanks sir. Hey -Go turn the motor on. -Okay sir. If anybody comes, inquire who they are at the gates. Times are bad. Go. Let's move! I feel like I have seen him somewhere. Where? I think with Veera! Brother! -What? -Just a small help. Have you seen any of them in this photo? Hey! Who are you? Get out Brother if you help me... No. You've come for something else. Get out! Get out. Get out! Security! Throw them out and close the gates! Get going! Idiot... Uncle, please hand me that ball! Hey sweety. Hey! Have you seen her before? She's Mithra's mom! Where were they? In the 8th floor Uncle, hand me the ball. Let me play. Whats our plan? This needs to be dealt differently. Hey! You... what are you doing here? Hey stop! Hey stop! Are you going to the ground floor?

I don't want to die like the other three. If your concocted story is true We need to find where he buried that dead body We chopped the dead body into many pieces on the same night. We buried it in Veera's quarry. Do you remember where exactly you buried the body? No I don't. That night, we all were intoxicated. I don't remember the exact spot. If you want to live, then her skull must be burnt. Start immediately. We need to find their skull soon. Go straight and take next right. Is it necessary for me to come along? The car won't go inside, so we need to walk from here. We found... what we were looking for. We'll go and burn that skull. Until then, don't step out of the ring! No one can harm you by surpassing this. Take right. [lady sobbing] Why did you do this to us? Why did you do this to us? Why did you do this to us? Why did you do this to us? Hey stop! Vishwanathan! Let her go. Let Kayal go! Leave Kayal! In my life.. No one could have given me such a punishment. As long as I live.. This guilt will never leave me. Forgive me! A small doll. I think I left it here. A doll? What kind of a doll? It's like a... Small... Like a toy. A small doll. I think I left it here. If you had left it here.. My guys would have kept it in shelf. Let me check sir. -This one, sir? -Yeah, that one! It's been here for long. We had no idea who left it here. It was pretty weird. No. Then Nalan Have you ever thought... That girl Mithra.. Died after memory loss. She didn't remember anyone who wronged her. We know. She didn't take revenge. She can't take revenge either. It was all done by her mother. But... But how did she punish that Vishwanathan... I don't understand What do you think Nalan? If you don't understand... -How would I know? -Right. Okay. My work is done. Well, thank you.
