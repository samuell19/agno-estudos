Damn it, man! That was our ride! You just stunned our ride! Oh, great. Run! What the hell did you take? I have no idea, but they were bowing to it. Kirk to shuttle one. Locals are out of the kill zone. You are clear. Repeat. Spock, get in there, neutralize the volcano and let's get out of here. We have to do this now! I told the captain the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat. Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you? No, Mr. Spock, they did not. The prime directive clearly states there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations. I know what it says! Which is why I'm running through the jungle wearing a disguise! Now drop off your super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out! You're good. If we're gonna do this, we've got to do it now! This ash is killing our coils. You sure you don't want me to go instead? That would be highly illogical as I am already outfitted... Spock, I was kidding. You got this. Guys! We have to go! Now! They're trying to kill us! They're trying to kill us, Jim! I'll see you in 90 seconds. Raising shield 2. Mark 7. Do it, do it! Prerequisite change, 2-7-3. Reduce descent. I repeat... I can't hold this position. Spock, I've got to pull you back up. Negative. This is our only chance to save this species. If this volcano erupts, the planet dies. Pull him back up. Now! Spock, are you okay? I am, surprisingly, alive. Stand by. We have to get him back. I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down. We have to abandon the shuttle. We can't just leave him, sulu! We don't have a choice! Uhura, I'm sorry. Spock, we're going back to the enterprise. We'll get you out of there. Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle. You've got to make it to the enterprise on your own. Wonderful! Uhura! You ready to swim? I'm ready. Jim! Jim! The beach is that way! I know! We're not going to the beach! Oh, no, no, no! I hate this! I know you do! Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean? We've been down here since last night! The salt water's gonna ruin the... Scotty! Where's Spock? Still in the volcano, sir. Captain on the bridge! Lieutenant, do we have an open channel to Mr. Spock? The heat's frying his comms, but we still have contact. Spock? I have activated the device, captain. When the countdown is complete, the reaction should render the volcano inert. Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert! Negative, sir. Not with these magnetic fields. I need to beam Spock back to the ship. Give me one way to do it. Uh, maybe if we had a direct line of sight. You're talking about an active volcano! Sir, if that thing erupts, I cannot guarantee we can withstand the heat! I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude. Our shuttle was concealed by the ash cloud, but the enterprise is too large. If utilized in a rescue effort, it would be revealed to the indigenous specie. Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you, but there has got to be an exception. None. Such action violates the prime directive. Shut up, Spock! We're trying to save you, damn it! Doctor, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Spock, we're talking about your life! The rule cannot be broken... Spock! Try to get him back online. Ninety seconds to detonations. If Spock were here and I were there, what would he do? He'd let you die. Spock! You all right? Captain, you let them see our ship. He's fine. Bridge to captain Kirk. Yes, lieutenant. Is commander Spock on board, sir? Safely and soundly. Please notify him that his device has successfully detonated. You hear that? Congratulations, Spock. You just saved the world. You violated the prime directive. Oh, come on, Spock. They saw us. Big deal. I can save her. What did you say? Your daughter. I can save her. Who are you? Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go. Jim! You're not actually gonna answer that, are you? Spock, I'm telling you, this is why he called. I can feel it. Your feeling aside, I consider it highly unlikely that we Will be selected for the new program. Why else would Pike want to see us? Forget about seniority. They gave us the newest ship in the fleet. I can think of numerous possibilities. A five-year mission, Spock! That's deep space! That's uncharted territory! Think how incredible that's gonna be. Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk. "Uneventful." admiral? It's the way you described the survey of nibiru in your captain's log. Uh, yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time going over the details. Tell me more about this volcano. Data says it was highly volatile. If it were to erupt, it would wipe out the planet. Let's hope it doesn't, sir. Something tells me it won't. Uh, well, sir, volatile is all relative. Maybe our data was off. Or maybe it didn't erupt because Mr. Spock detonated a cold fusion device inside it right after a civilization that's barely invented the wheel happened to see a starship rising out of their ocean! That is pretty much how you describe it, is it not? Admiral... you filed a report? Why didn't you tell me? I incorrectly assumed that you would be truthful in your captain's log. Yeah, I would have been if I didn't have to save your life, and the very reason I felt it necessary to take responsibility for the actions... Take responsibility, yeah. That'd be so noble, pointy, if you weren't also throwing me under the bus. "Pointy"? Is that a derogatory reference to... Gentlemen. Starfleet's mandate is to explore and observe, not to interfere. Had the mission gone according to plan, admiral, the indigenous species would never have been aware of our interference. That's a technicality. I am vulcan, sir. We embrace technicality. Are you giving me attitude, Spock? I'm expressing multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir. To which are you referring? Out. You're dismissed, commander. You have any idea what a pain in the ass you are? I think so, sir. So tell me what you did wrong. What's the lesson to be learned here? Never trust a vulcan. Now, see, you can't even answer the question. You lied. On an official report, you lied. You think the rules don't apply to you 'cause you disagree with them. That's why you talked me into signing up in the first place. It's why you gave me your ship. I gave you my ship because I saw a greatness in you. And now, I see you haven't got an ounce of humility. What was I supposed to do, let Spock die? You're missing the point. I don't think I am, sir. What would you have done? I wouldn't have risked my first officer's life in the first place! You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny! You violated a dozen starfleet regulations and almost got everyone under your command killed. Except I didn't! You know how many crew members I've lost? Not one! That's your problem, you think you're infallible! You think you can't make a mistake. It's a pattern with you! The rules are for other people! Some should be. And what's worse is you using blind luck to justify your playing god! Given the circumstances, this has been brought to admiral Marcus's attention. He convened a special tribunal, to which I was not invited. You understand what starfleet regulations mandate be done at this point. They've taken the enterprise away from you. They're sending you back to the academy. Admiral, listen... I understand regulation, but every decision I've made... No! I can't listen! You don't comply with the rules, you don't take responsibility for anything, and you don't respect the chair. You know why? Because you're not ready for it. Blue security clearance now permitted for airlock access. I'm going to need three titanium... Radiation protection is required in this area. How did you find me? I know you better than you think I do. The first time I found you was in a dive like this. Remember that? You got your ass handed to you. No, I didn't. You don't? No, that's not what happened. That was an epic beating. No, it wasn't. You had napkins hanging out of your nose. Did you not? Yeah, that was a good fight. "A good fight." I think that's your problem right there. They gave her back to me. The enterprise. Congratulations. Watch your back with that first officer, though. Spock's not going to be working with me. He's been transferred. U.s.s. Bradbury. You're going to be my first officer. Yeah, Marcus took some convincing. But every now and then I can make a good case. What did you tell him? The truth. That I believe in you. That if anybody deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk. I don't know what to say. That is a first. It's going to be okay, son. "Emergency session, daystrom." That's us. Yeah. Suit up. All starfleet personnel, please be advised, - new security protocols are in effect. - Captain. Not anymore, Spock. First officer. I was demoted and you were reassigned. It is fortunate that the consequences were not more severe. You've got to be kidding me. Captain, it was never my intention... Not captain. I saved your life, Spock. You wrote a report, I lost my ship. Commander, I see now I should have alerted you to the fact that I submitted the report. No, I'm familiar with your compulsion to follow the rules. But you see, I can't do that. Where I come from, if someone saves your life, you don't stab him in the back. Vulcans cannot lie. Then I'm talking to the half-human part of you. All right? Do you understand why I went back for you? Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, u.S.S. Bradbury. Guess you're with me. Yes, captain. The truth is I'm going to miss you. Admiral Marcus, sir. Thank you for convening on such short notice. Be seated. By now, some of you have heard what happened in London. The target was a starfleet data archive. Now it's a damned hole in the ground, 42 men and women are dead. One hour ago, I received a message from a starfleet officer, who confessed to carrying out this attack, that he was being forced to do it by this man, commander John Harrison. He's one of our own. And he is the man responsible for this act of savagery. For reasons unknown, John Harrison has just declared a one-man war against starfleet. And under no circumstances are we to allow this man to escape federation space. You here tonight represent the senior command of all the vessels in the region. And in the name of those we lost, you Will run this bastard down. This is a manhunt, pure and simple, so let's get to work. Earth's perimeter sensors have not detected any Warp signatures leaving the system, so we know he can't be far. You Will park your ships in a blockade formation then deploy search vehicles and landing parties to run down every lead. This man has shown willingness to kill innocent people, so the rules of engagement are simple. If you come across this man and fear for your life or the lives of those nearby, you are authorized to use deadly force on sight. What's in the bag? James, not now. It doesn't seem odd to you that he'd target an archive? It's like bombing a library. Chris? Everything okay there? Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating to his new position as first officer. You got something to say, Kirk, say it. Tomorrow's too late. I'm fine, sir. My apologies. Spit it out, son. Don't be shy. Why the archive? All that information is public record. If he really wanted to damage starfleet, this could just be the beginning. The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk? Sir, in the event of an attack, protocol mandates that senior command gather captains and first officers at starfleet h.Q., right here - in this room. - It is curious Harrison would commandeer a jump ship without Warp capabilities... Clear the room! No! We need an air defense team! Daystrom conference room! - Let's go! - Cover me! - Target acquired. - Take him out! Watch my flank! - Go, go, go! - Cover me! Fire! Yeah? Commander, Mr. Scott has found something in the wreckage of Harrison's ship. He has asked to see us right away. Captain! I found this in the crashed jump ship, sir. This is how the bastard got away. What do you mean? It's a portable transwarp beaming device. Well, can you figure out where he went? I already did, sir. And you're no gonna like it. He's gone to the one place we... We just can't go. Admiral, sir, he's not on earth. He's on kronos, sir. I request my command be reinstated and your permission to go after him. Give us a minute. Kronos. Yes, sir. So Harrison's gone to the klingon homeworld. Is he defecting? Uh, we're not sure, sir. He has taken refuge in the ketha province, a region uninhabited for decades. He's gotta be hiding there, sir! He knows if we even go near klingon space, it'd be all-out war. Starfleet can't go after him, but I can. Please, sir. All-out war with the klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk. If you ask me, it's already begun. Since we first learned of their existence, the klingon empire has conquered and occupied two planets that we know of and fired on our ships half a dozen times. They are coming our way. London was not an archive. It was a top-secret branch of starfleet designated section 31. They were developing defense technology and training our officers to gather intelligence on the klingons and any other potential enemy who means to do us harm. Harrison was one of our top agents. Well, now he's a fugitive and I want to take him out. Pike always said you were one of our best and brightest. You should have heard him defend you. He's the one who talked you into joining starfleet, wasn't he? Yes, sir. Did he ever tell you who talked him into joining? His death is on me. And yours can't be. Sir, please. All I... Mr. Spock, you said the province where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited? Affirmative, sir. As part of our defensive strategy, 31 developed a new photon torpedo. Long-range and untraceable, it would be invisible to klingon sensors. I don't want you hurt, but I want to take him out. You park on the edge of the neutral zone, you lock onto Harrison's position, you fire, you kill him and you haul ass. Permission to reinstate Mr. Spock as my first officer. Granted. Jim! Where were you? For what? Your medical exam. Ten hours ago, you were in a damn firefight. Now it's my duty as ship's... I'm fine, bones. The hell you are. I'm fine. Status report, Mr. Spock. The enterprise should be ready for launch by the time we arrive. Good. Good. Captain. Thank you for requesting my reinstatement. You're welcome. As I am again your first officer, it is now my duty to strongly object to our mission parameters. There is no starfleet regulation that condemns a man to die without a trial, something you and admiral Marcus are forgetting. Also, preemptively firing torpedoes at the klingon homeworld goes against... You yourself said the area's uninhabited. There's only gonna be one casualty. Our orders have nothing to do with starfleet regulation. Wait a minute. We're firing torpedoes at the klingons? Regulations aside, this action is morally wrong. Regulations aside, pulling your ass out of a volcano was morally right. And I didn't win any points for that. I'm not gonna take ethics lessons from a robot! Reverting to name-calling suggests that you are defensive and therefore find my opinion valid. I wasn't asking for your opinion. Bones, get that thing off my face. Captain, our mission could start a war with the klingons and it is, by its very definition, immoral. Perhaps you should take the requisite time to arrive at this conclusion for yourself. Captain Kirk. Science officer Wallace. I've been assigned to the enterprise by admiral Marcus. These are my transfer orders. You requested an additional science officer, captain? I wish I had. "Lieutenant Carol Wallace." "Doctorate in applied physics" "specializing in advanced weaponry." Impressive credentials. Thank you. But redundant now that I am back aboard the enterprise. And yet, the more the merrier. Have a seat, doctor. Thank you. Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off. No! I'm not signing anything! Now, get these bloody things off my ship! Captain! Is there a problem, Mr. Scott? Aye, sir. I was just explaining to this gentleman that I cannot authorize any weapons on board this ship without knowing what's inside them. Mr. Scott raises yet another point... Report to the bridge. Captain. Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns, but we need these torpedoes on board. Due respect, sir, but photon torpedoes run on fuel. Now, I cannot detect the type of fuel that's in the compartments on these torpedoes because it's shielded. Now, I asked for the specifications, but he said... It's classified. It's classified. So I said, "no specs, no signature!" Captain. Flight check's complete. We're good to go, sir. Thank you, Mr. sulu. Yes, sir. Now if you'll excuse me, sir, I have a Warp core to prime. Get down! Jim, your vitals are way off. Report to the med BAY. Scotty! I need you to approve those weapons. I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty. Do you know what this is? It's a Warp core. It's a radioactive catastrophe waiting to happen. A subtle shift in magnetic output from, say, firing one or more of six dozen torpedoes with an unknown payload could set off a chain reaction which would kill every living thing on this ship. Letting those torpedoes on board the enterprise is the last straw! What was the first straw? What was the... There are plenty of straws. How about starfleet confiscating my transwarp equation? And now some madman's using it to hop across the galaxy! Where do you think he got it from? We have our orders, Scotty! That's what scares me. This is clearly a military operation. Is that what we are now? 'Cause I thought we were explorers. Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order. Right, well, you leave me no choice but to resign my duties. Oh, come on, Scotty. You're giving me no choice, sir. I Will not stand by... You're not giving me much of a choice... Will you just make an exception and sign... Do you accept my resignation or not? I do! I do. You are relieved, Mr. Scott. Jim, for the love of god, do not use those torpedoes. Attention. Warp core anti-matter containment check in three minutes. Captain! I'm so sorry about admiral Pike. We all are. Are you okay? Fine, thank you, lieutenant. Actually, Scotty just quit. And your boyfriend's second-guessing me every chance he gets. I'm sorry, that was inappropriate. It's just sometimes I want to rip the bangs off his head. You know, maybe it's me. I... It's not you. It's not? Wait, are you guys... Are you guys fighting? I'd rather not talk about it, sir. Oh, my god! What is that even like? Your ears burning? Captain on the bridge! Captain. Mr. Chekov. You've been shadowing Mr. Scott. You are familiar with the engineering systems of this ship? Affirmative, sir. Good. You're my new chief. Go put on a red shirt. Aye, captain. Retract all moorings, Mr. sulu. Yes, sir. Docking clamps one, two, and three are released. All moorings retracted. Lieutenant uhura, open a shipwide channel. Yes, sir. Mr. Chekov, how we looking down there? All systems nominal, captain. Copy that. Warp available at your command. Thank you, Mr. Chekov. All right. Let's ride. Yes, sir. Channel open, sir. Attention, crew of the enterprise. As most of you know, Christopher Pike, former captain of this ship and our friend, is dead. The man who killed him has fled our system and is hiding on the klingon homeworld, somewhere he believes we are unwilling to go. We are on our way there now. That our presence go undetected. Tensions between the federation and the klingon empire have been high. Any provocation could led to an all-out war. I Will personally lead a landing party to an abandoned city on the surface of kronos where we Will capture the fugitive, John Harrison, and return him to earth so he can face judgment for his actions. All right. Let's go get this son of a bitch. Kirk out. Captain, I believe you have made the right decision. If I can be of assistance, I would be happy to accompany you on the away team. You? Happy? I was simply attempting to use your vernacular to convey an idea. Thank you, Mr. Spock. All personnel, prepare for the closing of payload BAY doors. Mr. Spock. You startled me. What are you doing, doctor? Verifying that the torpedo's internal... You misunderstand. What are you doing aboard this ship? There is no record of you being assigned to the enterprise. Really? That must be some sort of mistake. My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus. Except that you have lied about your identity. Wallace is the surname of your mother. I can only assume the admiral is your father. Mr. Spock. I'm aware that I have no right to ask this of you. But please, he cannot know that I'm here... Engineering manually dropped us out of Warp, sir. Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship? Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened! The core overheated. I had to activate the emergency stop. It must be a coolant leak. I need time to find it. Sorry, captain. Damn it. Mr. sulu, time to our destination. Twenty minutes, sir. That's 20 minutes in enemy space we weren't counting on. All right. We better hop to it. Where's Spock? Here, captain. You're coming with me to kronos. Lieutenant, how's your klingon? It's rusty, but it's good. Good, you're coming, too. This isn't going to be a problem, is it, you two working together? Absolutely not. Unclear. I'll meet you in the shuttle BAY. Jim, you're not actually going down there, are you? You don't Rob a bank when the getaway car has a flat tire. I'm sure engineering Will have us all patched up by the time we get back. Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov? Yes, captain. I'll do my best, sir. Mr. sulu, you have the conn. Once we're en route, I want you to transmit a targeted comm burst to Harrison's location. You tell him you have a bunch of real big torpedoes pointed at his head and if he doesn't play nice, you're not afraid to use them. Is that a problem? No, sir. I've just never sat in the chair before. You're gonna do great. Jim! Wait! You just sat that man down at a high-stakes poker game with no cards and told him to bluff. Now sulu's a good man, but he is no captain. And enough with the metaphors, all right? That's an order. Mr. sulu, make sure that k'normian ship is ready to fly. Acting captain sulu to shuttle BAY 2. Please have the trade ship we confiscated during the mudd incident last month fueled and flight ready. Captain Kirk is en route to you now. Ready to deploy, captain. Lieutenants, lose the red shirts. You are k'normian arms dealers. Put those on. Sir? Look, if this thing goes south, there can be nothing tying us to starfleet. Unless of course you want to start a war, Mr. hendorff. No, sir. No, sir. Good. Me, neither. I am detecting a single life sign in the ketha province. Given the information provided by Mr. Scott, this is most likely John Harrison. Mr. sulu, I think we found our man. You let him know you mean business. Aye, captain. Attention, John Harrison. This is captain hikaru sulu of the u.S.S. Enterprise. A shuttle of highly trained officers is on its way to your location. If you do not surrender to them immediately, I Will unleash the entire payload of advanced long-range torpedoes currently locked onto your location. You have two minutes to confirm your complain. Refusal to do so Will result in your obliteration. If you test me, you Will fail. Mr. sulu, remind me never to piss you off. We Will arrive at Harrison's location in three minutes, captain. It is unlikely that he Will come willingly. I calculate the odds of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%. Fantastic. Good thing you don't care about dying. I am sorry, lieutenant. I could not hear what you said. Oh, I didn't say anything. Actually, I'd be happy to speak if you're. Lieutenant, I would prefer to discuss this in private. You'd prefer not to discuss this at all. What never seems to require your undivided focus... I'm sorry, captain, just two seconds. Okay... is us. At that volcano, you didn't give a thought to us. What it would do to me if you died, Spock. You didn't feel anything. You didn't care. And I'm not the only one who's upset with you. The captain is, too. Wha... no, no, no. Don't drag me into this. She is right. Your suggestion that I do not care about dying is incorrect. A sentient being's optimal chance at maximizing their utility is a long and prosperous life. Great. Not exactly a love song, Spock. You misunderstand. It is true I chose not to feel anything upon realizing that my own life was ending. As admiral Pike was dying, I joined with his consciousness and experienced what he felt at the moment of his passing. Anger. Confusion. Loneliness. Fear. I had experienced those feelings before, multiplied exponentially on the day my planet was destroyed. Such a feeling is something I choose never to experience again. Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel as a reflection of my not caring. Well, I assure you, the truth is precisely the opposite. What the hell was that? What happened? Where's their signal? It cut out. I'm working to get them back. We are being pursued by a d-4 class klingon vessel. I thought this sector was abandoned! It must be a random patrol. Hold on! This ship has no offensive capabilities. It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells. Aye, captain. They're closing fast, bearing 285! All right, there! There! We can lose them there. If you are suggesting that we utilize the passage between the approaching structures, this ship Will not fit. We'll fit. Captain, we Will not fit. We'll fit, we'll fit! I told you we'd fit. I am not sure that qualifies. Any sign of them? - No. Which worries me. - We lost them! Or they're jamming our scanners. Or we lost them. They're ordering us to land. Captain, they're gonna want to know why we're here. And they're gonna torture us. Question us. And they're gonna kill us. So we come out shooting. We're outnumbered, outgunned. There's no way we survive if we attack first. You brought me here because I speak klingon. Then let me speak klingon. This isn't going to work. It is our only logical option. And if you interrupt her now, you Will not only incur the wrath of the klingons but that of lieutenant uhura as well. Lieutenant. Thanks, captain. Stand down. How many torpedoes? Stand down! The weapons you threatened me with in your message. How many are there? Seventy-two. I surrender. On behalf of Christopher Pike, my friend, I accept your surrender. Captain! Captain. Cuff him. - Bones, meet me in the brig. - Be right there. Lieutenant. Contact starfleet, let them know we have Harrison in custody, and we'll be on our way once the Warp core is repaired. Yes, sir. - Why the hell did he surrender? - I don't know. But he just took out a squad of klingons single-handedly. I want to know how. Sounds like we have a Superman on board. You tell me. Put your arm through the hole. I'm gonna take a blood sample. Why aren't we moving, captain? An unexpected malfunction, perhaps in your Warp core conveniently stranding you on the edge of klingon space? How the hell do you know that? Bones. I think you'd find my insight valuable, captain. We good? Yeah. Let me know what you find. Ignore me and you Will get everyone on this ship killed. Captain, I believe he Will only attempt to manipulate you. I would not recommend engaging the prisoner further. Give me a minute. Let me explain what's happening here. You are a criminal. I watched you murder innocent men and women. I was authorized to end you! And the only reason why you are still alive is because I am allowing it. So shut your mouth. Oh, captain, are you going to punch me again over and over till your arm weakens? Clearly you want to, so tell me, why did you allow me to live? We all make mistakes. No. I surrendered to you because, despite your attempt to convince me otherwise, you seem to have a conscience, Mr. Kirk. If you did not, then it would be impossible for me to convince you of the truth. 23-17-46-11. Coordinates not far from earth. If you want to know why I did what I did, go and take a look. Give me one reason why I should listen to you. I can give you 72. And they're on board your ship, captain. They have been all along. I suggest you open one up. Oh! Hi! You know what really bothers me, though? It's the modifications, you know, the enhancements. Right? And then like that, I'm off the ship! Just for trying to do what's right! And what did you do anyway? You just stood there like an oyster, looking at me! What? Scotty, it's Kirk. Oh, well now! If it isn't captain James Tiberius perfect hair! Did you hear that? I called him perfect hair. Where are you? Where are you? Are you drunk? What I do in my private time is my business, jimbo. I need you to help me out with something. Will you take these coordinates down? 23-17-46-11. Hmm. Are you writing? What, you don't think I can remember four numbers? Ye of little faith. What was the third one? Forty-six. I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but I have a feeling you'll know it when you see it. You may have been right about those torpedoes. I Will consider that an apology. And I Will consider that apology. You are the one who quit. You made me quit! Mr. Scott? Scott. Ah... The nerve of that guy! I am not doing that man any favors! No! Ach! All right, then! Are you out of your corn-fed mind? You're not actually going to listen to this guy? He killed Pike, he almost killed you, and now you think it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo because he dared you to. Why did he save our lives, bones? The doctor does have a point, captain. Don't agree with me, Spock. It makes me very uncomfortable. Perhaps you too should learn to govern your emotions, doctor. In this situation, logic dictates... Logic? Oh, my god! There's a maniac trying to make us blow up our own damn ship and... That's not it. I don't know why he surrendered, but that's not it. Look, we're gonna open a torpedo. The question is how. But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board, who exactly is qualified to just pop open a four-ton stick of dynamite? The admiral's daughter appeared to have interest in the torpedoes and she is a weapons specialist. Perhaps she could be of some use. What admiral's daughter? Carol Marcus. Your new science officer concealed her identity to board the ship. When were you going to tell me that? When it became relevant. As it just did. Are the torpedoes in the weapons BAY? Loaded and ready to fire. What are they? I don't know. That's why I forged my transfer onto your ship to find out why. I do apologize for that. By the way, if I caused you any problems, I am sorry. I'm Carol Marcus. James Kirk. Torpedoes. My father gave me access to every program he oversaw, then I heard he was developing these prototype torpedoes. Uh-huh. When I went to confront him about it, he wouldn't even see me. That's when I discovered the torpedoes had disappeared from all official records. And then he gave them to me. You're much cleverer than your reputation suggests, captain Kirk. I have a reputation? Yes, you do. I'm a friend of Christine chapel's. Christine, yes. How is she? She transferred to the outer frontier to be a nurse. She's much happier now. That's good. You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you? What... what are we doing in here? Is this shuttle prepped to fly? Of course it is. Would you please turn around? Why? Just turn around. It's too dangerous to try and open one of these torpedoes on the enterprise. But there is a nearby planetoid. I can open one up there. But I Will need some help. Turn around. Now! Captain on the bridge! Mr. sulu, have doctors Marcus and McCoy landed on the planetoid yet? Yes, sir. They're moving the torpedo into position now. Good. Any activity from the klingons? Not yet. But if we're stuck here much longer, they Will find us. Lieutenant uhura, did you let starfleet know we have Harrison in custody? Yes, sir. No response yet. Engineering to bridge. Hello. Captain, can you hear me? Mr. Chekov, give me some good news. We found the leak, sir, but the damage is substantial. We're working on it. Any idea what caused it? Uh, no, sir. But I accept full responsibility. Something tells me it wasn't your fault. Stay on it. Shuttle is standing by, captain. Bones, thanks for helping out. Dr. Marcus asked for the steadiest hands on the ship. You know, when I dreamt about being stuck on a deserted planet with a gorgeous woman, there was no torpedo! Dr. McCoy, may I remind you, you are not there to flirt. So how can these legendary hands help you, Dr. Marcus? Bones! To understand how powerful these weapons are, we need to open the warhead. To do that, we need to access the fuel compartment. Unfortunately for us, the warheads on these weapons are live. Sweetheart, I once performed an emergency c-section on a pregnant gorn. Octuplets. And let me tell you, those little bastards bite. I think I can work some magic on your missile. Dr. McCoy, there's a bundle of fiber optic cables against the inner casing. You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down. Whatever you do, do not touch anything else. Do you understand? Right. The thought never crossed my mind. Dr. McCoy, wait for my word. I'm rerouting the detonation process. Are you ready? And raring. Good luck. Sir, the torpedo just armed itself. The warhead's gonna detonate in 30 seconds, sir! What the hell happened? I can't get my arm out! The transporter cannot differentiate between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo. We cannot beam back one without the other. Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it? I'm trying. I'm trying. Jim, get her the hell out of here! No! If you beam me back, he dies! Just let me do it! Ten. Nine. Eight. Standing by to transport Dr. Marcus on your command, sir. Four. Three. Shit! Deactivation successful, captain. Dr. McCoy, are you all right? Bones! Jim? You're going to want to see this. Delta team, deliver your thrusters to loading dock 12. U.s.s. Vengeance, bridge crew requesting entry to construction hangar. You are cleared to enter the hangar. I need a welding team on the number one nacelle. Holy sh... What have we got? This fuel container's been removed from the torpedo and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube. - Is he alive? - He's alive. But if we try to revive him without the proper sequencing, it could kill him. This technology's beyond me. How advanced, doctor? It's not advanced. That cryo tube is ancient. We haven't needed to freeze anyone since we developed Warp capability, which explains the most interesting thing about our friend here. He's 300 years old. Why is there a man in that torpedo? There are men and women in all those torpedoes, captain. I put them there. Who the hell are you? A remnant of a time long past. Genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war. But we were condemned as criminals, forced into exile. For centuries we slept, hoping when we awoke, things would be different. But as a result of the destruction of vulcan, your starfleet began to aggressively search distant quadrants of space. My ship was found adrift. I alone was revived. I looked up "John Harrison." Until a year ago, he didn't exist. John Harrison was a fiction created the moment I was awoken by your admiral Marcus to help him advance his cause. A smokescreen to conceal my true identity. My name is, Khan. Why would a starfleet admiral ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help? Because I am better. At what? Everything. Alexander Marcus needed to respond to an uncivilized threat in a civilized time and for that he needed a warrior's mind. My mind. To design weapons and warships. You are suggesting the admiral violated every regulation he vowed to uphold simply because he wanted to exploit your intellect. He wanted to exploit my savagery. Intellect alone is useless in a fight, Mr. Spock. You... you can't even break a rule. How would you be expected to break bone? Marcus used me to design weapons. To help him realize his vision of a militarized starfleet. He sent you to use those weapons. To fire my torpedoes on an unsuspecting planet. And then he purposely crippled your ship in enemy space, leading to one inevitable outcome. The klingons would come searching for whomever was responsible, and you would have no chance of escape. Marcus would finally have the war he talked about. The war he always wanted. No. No. I watched you open fire in a room full of unarmed starfleet officers. You killed them in cold blood! Marcus took my crew from me. You are a murderer! He used my friends to control me. I tried to smuggle them to safety by concealing them in the very weapons I had designed, but I was discovered. I had no choice but to escape alone. And when I did, I had every reason to suspect that Marcus had killed every single one of the people I hold most dear. So I responded in kind. My crew is my family, Kirk. Is there anything you would not do for your family? Proximity alert, sir! There's a ship at Warp heading right for us. - Klingons? - At Warp? No, Kirk. - We both know who it is. - I don't think so. It's not coming at us from kronos. Lieutenant, move Khan to med BAY. Post six security officers on him. Yes, captain. Captain on the bridge! Eta of the incoming ship. Three seconds, sir. Shields. Aye, captain. They're hailing us, sir. On screen. Broadcast shipwide, for the record. Captain Kirk. Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you. That's a hell of a ship you got there. That you'd taken Harrison into custody in violation of your orders. Well, we, uh... We had to improvise when our Warp core unexpectedly malfunctioned. But you already knew that, didn't you, sir? I don't take your meaning. Well, that's why you're here, isn't it? To assist with our repairs? Why else would the head of starfleet personally come to the edge of the neutral zone? Captain, they're scanning our ship. Is there something I can help you find, sir? Where is your prisoner, ki? Per starfleet regulation, I'm planning on returning Khan to earth to stand trial. Well, shit. You talked to him. This is exactly what I was hoping to spare you from. I took a tactical risk and I woke that bastard, believing that his superior intelligence could help us protect ourselves from whatever came at us next. But I made a mistake. And now the blood of everybody he's killed is on my hands. So I'm asking you, give him to me so that I can end what I started. And what exactly would you like me to do with the rest of his crew, sir? Fire them at the klingons? End 72 lives? Start a war in the process? He put those people in those torpedoes. And I simply didn't want to burden u with knowing what was inside of the. You saw what this man can do all by himself. If we woke up the rest of his crew? What else did he tell you? That he's a peacekeeper? He's playing you, so, don't you see that? Khan and his crew were condemned to death as war criminals. And now it is our duty to carry out that sentence before anybody else dies because of hi. Now, I'm going to ask you again! One last time, son. Lower your shields. Tell me where he is. He's in engineering, sir. But I'll have him moved to the transporter room right away. I'll take it from here. - Do not drop those shields, Mr. sulu. - Aye, captain. Captain, given your awareness of Khan's true location in the med BAY, may I know the details of your plan? I told Marcus we were bringing a fugitive back to earth. That's what we're going to do. Mr. Chekov, can we Warp? Sir, if we go to Warp, we run the risk of seriously damaging the core! Can we do it? Technically, yes, but I would not advise it, captain. Noted. Mr. sulu, set course for earth. Yes, sir. Punch it. Well, at least we're moving again. If you think you're safe at Warp, you're wrong. Lieutenant uhura, contact starfleet. Tell them we were pursued into the neutral zone by an unmarked federation ship. Comms are down, sir. Permission to come on the bridge. Dr. Marcus. He's gonna catch up with us, and when he does, the only thing that's gonna stop him destroying this ship is me, so you have to let me talk to him. Carol, we're at Warp. He can't catch up with us. Yes, he can. He's been developing a ship that has advanced Warp capabilities... Captain! I'm getting a reading I don't understand. Where are we? We're 237,000 kilometers from earth. Shields are dropping. We're defenseless, sir. Sir, we have a bulkhead breach. Where's the damage? Major hull damage, captain. Evasive maneuvers! Get us to earth! Right now! Crewman: Aye, sir. Captain! Stop! Everybody on this ship is going to die if you don't let me speak to him. Uhura, hail him. Sir. It's me. It's Carol. What are you doing on that ship? I heard what you said. That you made a mistake and now you're doing everything you can to fix it. But, dad, I don't believe that the man who raised me is capable of destroying a ship full of innocent people. And, if I'm wrong about that, then you're gonna have to do it with me on board. Actually, Carol, I won't. Oh. Jim... Can we intercept the transport signal? No, sir. Carol! Captain Kirk, without authorization and in league with the fugitive John Harris, you went rogue in enemy territory, leaving me no choice but to hunt you Don and destroy you. Lock phasers. Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait! Target all left torpedoes on the enterprise bridge. Sir, my crew was just... Was just following my orders. I take... I take full responsibility for my actions. But they were mine and they were mine alone. If I transmit Khan's location to you now, all that I ask is that you spare them. Please, sir. I'll do anything you want. Just let them live. That's a hell of an apology. But if it's any consolation, I was never going to spare your crew. Fire when ready... I'm sorry. Our weapons won't fire, sir! Someone in engineering just manually reset our systems! What do you mean, "someone"? Who? Their weapons have powered down. Sir. Enterprise! Can you hear me? Scotty! Guess what I found behind Jupiter. You're on that ship! I snuck on. And seeing as I've just committed an act of treason against a starfleet admiral, I'd really like to get off this bloody ship. Now beam me out! You're a miracle worker. We're a little low on power right now. Just stand by. Stand by. What do you mean, "low on power"? What happened to the enterprise? Call you back. Scotty! Spock. Our ship, how is she? Our options are limited, captain. We cannot fire and we cannot flee. There is one option. Uhura, when you get Scotty back, patch him through. Yes, sir. Mr. Spock, you have the conn. Captain, I strongly object. To what? I haven't said anything yet. Since we cannot take the ship from the outside, the only way we can take it is from within. And as a large boarding party would be detected, it is optimal for you to take as few members of the crew as possible. You Will meet resistance, requiring personnel with advanced combat abilities and innate knowledge of that ship. This indicates that you plan to align with Khan, the very man we were sent here to destroy. I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." An arabic proverb attributed to a prince who was betrayed and decapitated by his own subjects. Still, it's a hell of a quote. I Will go with you, captain. No, I need you on the bridge. I cannot allow you to do this. It is my function aboard this ship to advise you on making the wisest decisions possible, something I firmly believe you are incapable of doing in this moment. You're right! What I'm about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it's not logical. It is a gut feeling. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do. The enterprise and her crew need someone in that chair that knows what he's doing. And it's not me. It's you, Spock. Tell me everything you know about that ship. Dreadnought class. Two times the size, three times the speed. Advanced weaponry. Modified for a minimal crew. Unlike most federation vessels, it's built solely for combat. I Will do everything I can to make you answer for what you did. But right now I need your help. In exchange for what? You said you'd do anything for your crew. I can guarantee their safety. Captain. You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew. Bones, what are you doing with that tribble? The tribble's dead. I'm injecting Khan's platelets into the deceased tissue of a necrotic host. Khan's cells regenerate like nothing I've ever seen, and I want to know why. You coming with me or not? You want to do what? We're coming over there. Sulu's maneuvering the enterprise into position as we speak. To this ship? How? There's a cargo door, hangar 7, access port 101a. You need to find the manual override to open that airlock. Are you crazy? Whoever you are. Just listen to him, Scotty. It's gonna be all right. It is not gonna be all right. You want me to open an airlock into space, whereupon I Will freeze, die and explode! Lieutenant, from our current position, is it possible to establish contact with new vulcan? I'll do my best. Thank you. Mr. sulu, what is the status of the other ship? Their systems are still offline. I'm aligning our ship now. Scotty, how we doing over there? Captain, I wish I had better news. They've locked out access to the ship's computer. They'll have full weapons in three minutes. That means next time I won't be able to stop them destroying the enterprise. Stand by. Access port 101a of the other ship. Captain, the ships are aligned. Copy that. Scotty! I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute. I'm running. Stand by. Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, captain. This door is very wee. I mean, you know, small. It's four square meters, tops. It's gonna be like jumping out of a moving car, off a bridge, into your shot glass. It's okay. I've done it before. Yeah, it was vertical. We jumped onto a... it was a... It doesn't matter. Scotty... Did you find the manual override? The manual override, Scotty. Not yet, not yet. Captain, before you launch, you should be aware there is a considerable debris field between our ships. Spock, not now. Scotty, you good? It's not easy! Just give me two seconds, all right, you mad bastard! Tell me this is gonna work. I have neither the information nor the confidence to do so, doctor. Okay, captain, stand by. Boy, you're a real comfort. Come on, come on, come on. Yes! Okay, okay! I'm set to open the door. You ready? Are you? Spock, pull the trigger. Yes, captain. Launching activation sequence on three, two, one. Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432! Captain, there is debris directly ahead. Copy that. Whoa! Jim, you're way off course! I know, I know! I can see that. Don't move. Use your display compass, captain. You must correct precisely - 37.243 degrees. - Got it. I'm working my way back. Scotty, you're gonna be ready with that door, right? What are you doing in here? Wee bit of maintenance on the airlock console. You're big. Mr. Scott, where are you? Captain, he can't seem to hear you. I'm working on getting his signal back. Stand by. - Damn it. - Captain, what is it? My helmet was hit. Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back. His communicator is working. I don't know why he isn't responding. What is that? Are you starfleet or private security? Show me your other hand. Because you look like private security. Imminent collision detected! Khan, use evasive action! There is debris directly ahead. I see it. Mr. sulu, did we lose Khan? I don't know, commander. I'm having trouble tracking him in all this debris. Was Khan hit? We are trying to find him now. Captain, you need to adjust your target destination to 183 by 473 degrees. Spock, my display's dead. I'm flying blind. Hitting your target destination is mathematically impossible. Spock, if I get back, we really need to talk about your bedside manner. Commander, he's not going to make it. My display is still functioning. I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters ahead of me at my one o'clock. Come to your left a few degrees and follow me. Scotty, we're getting close. We need a warm welcome. Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty? If you can hear us, Mr. Scott, open the door in ten, nine... Scotty! That person counting down, what is that? Eight... I think you're hearing things, mate... seven... Mr. Scott, where are you? Six, five... 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters. Scotty, where are you? Three... Do you copy, Scotty? Please! Two... Sorry about this. About what? Mr. Scott, open the door! Open the door! Mr. Scott, now! Welcome aboard. It's good to see you, Scotty. Who is that? Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan. Hello. They'll know we're here. I know the best way to the bridge. It's locked to stun. Theirs won't be. Try not to get shot. Commander, I have that transmission as requested. On screen, please. Stand by. Mr. Spock. Mr. Spock. Admiral. I'll deal with you in a... I am ashamed to be your daughter. Sir, we just had a hangar door open on deck 13. Khan. They're going to have full power and we're walking? The turbolifts are easily tracked and Marcus would have us in a cage. This path runs adjacent to the engine room. They know they won't be able to use their weapons here without destabilizing the Warp core, which gives us the advantage. Where'd you find this guy? Oh, it's a long story. I Will be brief. In your travels, did you ever encounter a man named Khan? As you know, I have made a vow never to give you information that could potentially alter your destiny. Your path is yours to worth, and yours alone. That being said, Khan noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary the enterprise ever faced. He is brilliant, ruthless, and he Will not hesitate to kill every single one of you. Did you defeat him? At great cost. Yes. How? I don't mean to tempt fate here, but where is everybody? The ship is designed to be flown by minimal crew, one, if necessary. One? I... You all right? Yeah. Where's Khan? Lieutenant, I need you to assemble all senior medical and engineering staff in the weapons BAY. All right. Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated a torpedo. Could you replicate the process? Why the hell would I want to do that? Can you or can you not? Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician! The fact that you are a doctor is precisely why I need you to listen very carefully. Where is he? Shit! This way. The minute we get to the bridge, drop him. What, stun him? Khan? I thought he was helping us. I'm pretty sure we're helping him. Power coming online, sir! Retarget the enterprise now. Aye, sir. Make sure he stays down. Excuse me. Yeah. Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest. You're not actually going to do this, are you? Admiral, get out of the chair. You better stop and think about what you're doing, Kirk. You better think about what you did on kronos. You made an incursion onto an enemy planet! You killed a klingon patrol. Even if you got away without a trace, war is coming. And who is going to lead us? You? If I'm not in charge, our entire way of life is decimated! So you want me off this ship, you better kill me. I'm not going to kill you, sir. But I could stun your ass and drag you out of that chair. I'd rather not do that in front of your daughter. You all right? Yes, captain. Jim! Listen! Wait! You should have let me sleep. Where is the captain, Mr. sulu? Our sensor array's down, sir. I can't find him. I'm going to make this very simple for you. Captain. Your crew for my crew. You betrayed us. Oh, you are smart, Mr. Spock. Spock don't... Mr. Spock, give me my crew. And what Will you do when you get them? Continue the work we were doing before we were banished. Which, as I understand it, involves the mass genocide of any being you find to be less than superior. Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock? Or Will you give what I want? We have no transporter capabilities. Fortunately mine a perfectly function. Drop your shields. If I do so, I have no guarantee that you Will not destroy the enterprise. Well, let's play this out logically then, Mr. Spock. Firstly, I Will kill your captain to demonstrate my resolve. Then if yours holds, I Will have no choice but to kill you and your entire crew. If you destroy our ship, you Will also destroy your own people. Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not. I Will target your life support systems located behind the aft nacelle. And after every single person aboard your ship suffocates, I Will walk over your cold corpses to recover my people. Now, shall we begin? Lower shields. A wise choice, Mr. Spock. I see your 72 torpedoes are still in their tubes. If they are not mine, commander, I Will know it. Vulcans do not lie. The torpedoes are yours. Thank you, Mr. Spock. I have fulfilled your terms. Now fulfill mine. Well, Kirk, it seems apt to return you to your crew. After all, no ship should go down without her captain. He's locking phasers on us, sir! Let us out of here now! Shields at 6%! The torpedoes! How much time, lieutenant? Twelve seconds, sir! Crew of the enterprise, prepare for imminent proximity detonation. What's he talking about? What detonation? The torpedoes. He armed the damn torpedoes! No! Sir, their weapons have been knocked out. Not bad, commander. Thank you, lieutenant. Bones! Bones! Nurse! I got you. I got you. Dr. Marcus. Good to see you, Jim. You helped Spock detonate those torpedoes? Damn right I did. He killed Khan's crew! Spock's cold, but he's not that cold. I've got Khan's crew. Seventy-two human popsicles safe and sound in their cryo tubes. Son of a bitch! Sir, the central power grid is failing! Switch to auxiliary power. Auxiliary power failing, sir. Commander, our ship's caught in earth's gravity! Can we stop? I can't do anything. Sorry! Oh, no. Clear the area! Engage emergency lockdown! I hope you don't get seasick. Do you? Yeah. Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks. Aye, sir. As acting captain, I order you to abandon this ship. I Will remain behind and divert all power to life support and evacuation shuttle bays. Evacuation protocols... I order you to abandon the ship! All due respect, commander, but we're not going anywhere. Attention all decks. Evacuation protocols initiated. One day I've been off this ship! One bloody day! Gravity systems are failing. Hold on! Hold on! Attention, all decks. Evacuation protocols initiated. Proceed to exit bays and report to your assigned shuttle. There won't be time for evacuation if we don't get power to stabilize the damn ship! Can we restore it? Only from engineering. We have to get back to the Warp core. Attention all decks. Jim? Scotty, we got to get the power back on! Come on! Scotty, we got to jump! What? Jump! Jump! Oh, god. Emergency power at 15% and dropping. Attention, all decks. Evacuation protocols initiated. Proceed to exit bays and report to your assigned shuttle. Jim? Hold on! I can't. I've got you, captain! Chekov. Don't let go! Even if we get the Warp core online, we've still got to redirect the power! He's right, captain! What are you talking about? Someone has to hit the manual override. Uh, laddie, there's a switch... Behind the deflector dish! I'll flip the switch! Let's go! Oh, no. Oh-yoy! Oh-yoy! Evacuation protocols initiated. Proceed to exit bays and report to your assigned shuttle. Mr. sulu, divert any remaining power to stabilizers. Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can. Core misaligned. Danger. Oh, no, no, no, no! What? The housings are misaligned! There's no way we can redirect the power! The ship's dead, sir. She's gone. No, she's not. Wait, Jim! If we go in there, we'll die! Do you hear me? The radiation Will kill us! Will you listen to me? What the hell are you doing? I'm opening the door. I'm going in. That door is there to stop us from getting irradiated! We'd be dead before we made the climb! You're not making the climb. Danger. Core misaligned. Danger. Core misaligned. If we don't get power or shields back online, we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry! Warp core is back online! Maximum thrusters, Mr. sulu! Thrusters at maximum! Stand by! Stand by! Shields restored! Commander, power online. Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing. It's a miracle. There are no such things. Engineering to bridge. Mr. Spock! Mr. Scott. Sir, you'd better get down here. Better hurry. Open it. The decontamination process is not complete. You'd flood the whole compartment. The door's locked, sir. How's our ship? Out of danger. You saved the crew. You used what he wanted against him. That's a nice move. It is what you would have done. And this, this is what you would have done. It was only logical. I'm scared, Spock. Help me not be. How do you choose not to feel? I do not know. Right now I am failing. I want you to know why I couldn't let you die. Why I went back for you. Because you are my friend. Khan! God, that was close! Set destination, starfleet headquarters! Cannot guarantee destination. Confirm order. Confirm. Search the enemy ship for signs of life. Sir, there's no way anyone survived. He could. Yes, sir. Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters! Can we beam him up? There's too much damage. I have no incoming signal. But it may be possible to beam you down, sir. Go get him. Stand by for coordinates. Yes, sir. Enter 3517 by 2598. Coordinates confirmed. Get me a cryo tube, now! Get this guy out of the cryo tube. Keep him in an induced coma. We're gonna put Kirk inside. It's our only chance to preserve his brain function. How much of Khan's blood is left? None. Enterprise to Spock. Spock! Activate the cryogenic sequence. McCoy to bridge. I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive. You get that son of a bitch back on board right now! I think he can save Kirk. Can we beam them up to the ship? Ah, they keep moving! I can't get a lock on either of them. Can you beam someone down? Spock! Spock! Spock, stop! Stop! He's our only chance to save Kirk! - What is it? - It's a boy. Your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives. I dare you to do better. Oh, don't be so melodramatic. You were barely dead. It was the transfusion that really took its toll. You were out cold for two weeks. Transfusion? Your cells were heavily irradiated. We had no choice. Khan? Once we caught him, I synthesized a serum from his superblood. Tell me, are you feeling, uh, homicidal? Power mad? Despotic? No more than usual. How'd you catch him? I didn't. You saved my life. Uhura and I had something to do with it, too, you know. You saved my life, captain. And the lives... Spock, just... Thank you. You are welcome, Jim. There Will always be those who mean to do us ha. To stop them, we risk awakening the same evil within ourselves. Our first instinct is to seek revenge when those we love are taken from us. But that's not who we are. We are here today to rechristen the u.S.S. Enterprise, and to honor those who lost their lives nearly one year ago. When Christopher Pike first gave me his ship he had me recite the captain's oath, words I didn't appreciate at the time. Now I see them as a call for us to remember who we once were, and who we must be again. And those words? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship enterprise. Her five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain on the bridge. It's hard to get out of it once you've had a taste, isn't that right, Mr. sulu? "Captain" does have a nice ring to it. Chair's all yours, sir. Mr. Scott. How's our core? Purring like a kitten, captain. She's ready for a long journey. Excellent. Come on, bones! It's gonna be fun. Five years in space. God help me. Dr. Marcus. Uh... I'm glad you could be a part of the family. It's nice to have a family. Spock. Captain. Where shall we go? As a mission of this duration has never been attempted, I defer to your good judgment, captain. Mr. sulu, take us out. Aye, captain. Released @ areafiles. Org
