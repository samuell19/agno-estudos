What a lovely night, madam. Yes, that's right. Aldo Di Parolini, embassy attach?. - Baroness Mina von Kraft. - I'd love to dance with you. Champagne, please. Dear baroness, your perfume is unforgettable. Madame First Lady, I drink to your stunning beauty. ?mile, I'm sure you know captain Rudolf von Rath who triumphed at the horse show last Sunday. Congratulations. Your emperor must be proud of you. Mr. Prime Minister is too kind. I'll see you later, captain. Wonderful. You're a very happy man, Mr. Prime Minister. As are you, Madame First Lady. You own a real gem. Only a sketch, unfortunately. A very small sketch. Small but very beautiful. I prefer the Michelangelo. - A Michelangelo? - Yes, my dear. It's over there. Is it really a Michelangelo? Well... Dear Mathilde, be kind enough to introduce me to his Excellency Lord Bradbury? Sorry, Paul. My Lord, allow me to introduce Mr. Paul Desfontaines, our famous Prefect of Police. Pleased to meet you. You're almost as famous in London as in Paris. You were admiring the Michelangelo? Yes, but I was also told that you had a Botticelli. That's right. ?mile found it last winter when visiting an old castle for sale. The people there didn't know what it was. Come and see it. Believe it or not but to get it, I had to buy the house and its furniture. It cost next to nothing actually. If I had bought only the painting, the owners would been suspicious. Thank you, baroness. You are delightful. Say... Isn't that the famous Lord Bradbury with P.M. Duchamp? - Where? - Over there. - Yes. But don't you know him? - No. My dear baroness, you must fill in this gap. May I? A masterpiece! A real masterpiece! We almost bought the same in Florence. Do you remember? That's right. But it didn't go well with the modern style of the lounge. But you could have changed the furniture! My Lord, may I introduce the baroness Mina von Kraft who's eager to meet you. - What a nice name! - Delighted to meet you. - May I ask for this waltz? - Of course! I love this music. Madame, your party is wonderful. May I have this dance? - Do you know this person? - Never seen him before. The maharaja! Goodness me! I'd forgotten about him. - Who's that wonderful dancer? - I was about to ask you. Will you sing for us tonight? How do you know that I sing? I was at the Dangremont's the other night. You were so... - wonderful. - You were there? I remember! Your dress was the color of the moon. Ah... You were so beautiful. The lights have gone out. - Is this for a surprise? - It is not. A gas failure. Those things happen, you know. Calm yourselves, please. The problem will be rectified shortly. The gas will be restored, this won't last long. - Who are you? - Ernest, sir. What are you doing? Bring some light. Quick! Forgive me, Excellency. We're in the country and gas doesn't work as well as in Paris. Get more candles! In the meantime, play something, gentlemen, please. Anything! - Candles near the musicians. - Near the musicians? - Orders of the P.M.'s wife. - Very good, sir. Excuse me, Excellency. I can't believe it. Let's dance! Baptiste, follow me! Excuse me, Your Highness. So sorry. Say... What do you think it's worth? These two? Five or six francs maybe. - For the two? - Yeah! He spent more than that. That's his problem. Give me my beautiful paintings. - You were thirsty, my dear! - Parched! - Have you seen Signor Paolini? - We haven't. My dear lady, where's your painting? My painting? - It isn't here? - It isn't! Where is it then? But I have the majority, my dear. That doesn't worry me. - Where must I put this one? - Put it here. What worries me or rather what annoys me is something else. You understand... I've been robbed. Mathilde! Come see! - What? - Come! Good God! What about my Michelangelo? Extraordinary! At least my Michelangelo is safe. My best piece! They haven't seen this one. Ars?ne Lupin! So sorry, Mr. Prime Minister. I wonder why he didn't take this one. but your Michelangelo is a fake. He is an expert. Stazione Termine. Everybody out! - What? - What? Everybody out. I'll leave you here. We have to go on on foot? Precisamente! You saw that: 27 kms to Paris! A 27 kms' walk. Can you imagine? You should have told us, I wouldn't have come. I don't like walking. I don't like the country. Boss, yesterday, when you hired us you said we'd do the job in an automobile. - That's what I liked. - Nothing was said about coming back. I promised you 300 francs each, I'm giving you 500. That's all right then. If you need us again, you know where to find us. - Strange fellow. - We can't complain. The pay was good. Yes indeed. But I like to know who I work for. I prefer it. Give me a smoke. I'll take my bath now, Arthur. Tell Ursule to cook two eggs and ham. Well done. I'll expect you tonight in my dressing room after the show. I'll expect you tonight in my dressing room after the show. Arthur! Wind up the gramophone, Arthur. Here it is. Now go to Lachaume's, give them that card, See you tonight, my Nini! and tell them to deliver five dozens roses to the listed address. But nice roses, with very long stems. Food is served. Monsieur should eat while it's warm. Monsieur! You must clean up! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. I'd like to buy a wedding present. Sit down, please. We have lovely things for such events. - Well, it's for... - If I may. It's for my daughter's wedding. I had thought of a set of jewels. A little diamond necklace. A bracelet. And a tiara too maybe. Mr. Cl?ricy. Good morning, sir. This gentleman would like to buy some jewels for her daughter's wedding. May I ask you, with respect, how much money you intend to invest in the wedding presents of miss...? Colette Gilet. I am Raoul Gilet, wine-grower at Pessac near Bordeaux. I am a widower and next month I'll marry my daughter, my only child, to Mr. Pierre Bauchard, the son of my neighbor who's also my main trade rival. Cl?ricy, one of this House's partners. Allow me, Mr. Gilet, to congratulate you for this coming wedding which will most certainly make your daughter happy. Well, I think we had better show you several sorts of jewels, as chance inspires us. That way, we'll have an idea of what your wishes might be. May I leave you for a short while? I apologize for my indiscretion but I suppose Miss Gilet has come with you to Paris. - Of course! - Don't you think that to ask her about the choice that you are about to make. It might be wise indeed. In front of the young lady, we won't mention prices. It's not necessary as we know the kind of jewels you intend to buy and the amount of money you plan on spending. Well, in that case, I'll be glad to accept what you suggested. I'll ask you though to be kind enough to come to my hotel this afternoon - because my daughter can't leave. - Most certainly. She's expecting a few suppliers, milliner, linen seller... I do understand. Miss Gilet must be very busy getting her trousseau ready. I'd be pleased to oblige. Great! We're staying at the Hotel Meurice. - Very well. - It's now 4 minutes after 12 Time for a quick lunch. Let's say 3 o'clock, shall we? We shall be there at 3 o'clock. Let me thank you for the trust you have kindly shown for our House. I am sure that you won't regret it. I'm sure I won't. Goodbye, sir. They promised that all my dresses would be ready at 12 sharp. There are several bags of course. Very well, Baroness. You wrote down the address: 18, avenue de l'Op?ra? - Yes, Baroness. - Thank you. - Here you are, at last! - We're sorry. - Where shall we have lunch? - At the Caf? de Paris. The Caf? de Paris again! You haven't got much imagination. Paris still attracts many foreign visitors. We certainly don't complain. Of course! Now, I have an appointment later with two gentlemen from Berthier, the jeweler's store. They will be here at 3. - Will you show them up when they arrive? - Understood, sir. Thank you. - Concierge, please. - Gentlemen. Could you have us shown to Mr. Gilet's apartment, please? We have a 3 o'clock appointment. Mr. Gilet told me you were coming. Show these gentlemen to apartment 45. This way, please. Tell me, my child: how old are you? - I'm 22, sir. - Twenty-two! You don't look it yet. And how long have you been practicing your profession? - For three years, sir. - Three years! Very good, very good. Come in! Sir, two gentlemen want to see you. Very well. Have them wait in the sitting-room. Very good, sir. - I hate having visitors. - Really? Yes, really. Miss, you're going to do me a little favor. I'm at your disposal, sir. You see this clock? It's one minute after three. At five past three, not later, you'll knock at the door there, it opens into the sitting room. You will open it, without waiting for an answer, and you will see me there with two gentlemen. I'll ask you with a frown and you, without saying a word, no use speaking, lying, isn't it? You'll make a sign with your finger. Like so. - Like this? - That's it, my child. Then you'll shut the door. The rest is up to me. Those gentlemen will understand that I'm busy. That's all I want from you. At five past three, all right? Hello. Welcome. You're right on time. It's a good quality. Especially in business. My daughter is next door, with the manager of a linen shop. - I'll go get her in a short while. - No need to rush things. We're in no hurry. Here is the tiara. Its price is 115,000. If I may, I'll recommend it because of the exceptional quality of the stones. The main piece, the emerald, is a collector's item. The bracelets. 40,000. 50,000. 55,000. And now the necklaces. 110,000. 140,000. You'll notice that supple and light setting, the design of which is our exclusive property. It's an original creation which few people can say they've seen, as we made the first one for the Archduchess Sophie. For her recent wedding. This is the second one made in our workshop. We finished it the day before yesterday. That's all! - I must say I'm a quandary. - Please... My daughter seems to need help choosing. She's still a child. She always needs my advice. I'll help in those frivolous matters and then I'll call you. Very good, my dear child, you were very good. Thanks to you, my visitors understood that I was busy. That's what I wanted. You can leave now. Goodbye, miss. Thank you very much. If the daughter is as quick to decide as her father, it'll take time. But... You're crazy, my friend. Shut that down at once and sit down. I've had transactions fail for less than that. Mickey, you must obey your mum. Take off you roller skates. You must excuse him, sir. Our boys are the most ill-bred in the world. Maybe, but their mothers are the prettiest. It's intolerable. You've understood? Ars?ne Lupin! In a hurry to choose, I'll take all of them and ask you to send the bill to your insurance: Mr Lloyd in London. Do you know that you're in trouble, miss? I, sir! I fail to see what I can be reproached with. Accessory to a fraud. Quite simply! What about the hotel management then? If you say I'm an accessory, they're more so than I am. Since they rented out the apartment. And that's why the thief succeeded. You don't seem to like your employers. - No. - They fired her immediately. And I wonder why. What have I done? You've been much more obliging than a manicurist has to be. I? I only did what the management requires. How so? We're asked to do our best to satisfy the customers. The old man asked for a favor. I obliged him. Then they fire me and I'm arrested by the police. No! Don't raise your voice! - Where do you think you are? - The police! This is the prefect of police's office. And in the presence of the Prime Minister. Sir, I apologize. What's your name? L?ontine Chanut. How old are you? 22, Mr. Prime Minister. - What do your parents do? - I'm an orphan. My father was a civil servant. He died in the line of duty. His father was one of us. Leon Chanut, chief inspector at the Vice Squad. I knew him well. Fancy that! And you've been a manicurist for long? - Three years. - At the same place? - Yes, Mr. Prefect. - Yes, my dear, she is innocent. It's clear as day! But in the meantime, Lupin is still at large. Do something, by Jove! If good will must be stimulated, tell me, we'll do something. Look, I'll give a thousand louis to the person who'll help to arrest this thug. Aren't you afraid of being accused of seeking publicity? - In your situation. - You're right. We'll say that the police offers a 20 000 francs reward for Lupin's capture. All right? My newspaper will publish a special edition to announce it and we'll write about what happened in the Meurice Hotel. - With all the details. - Bravo, Mr. Prime Minister. Why are you saying this, miss? Because... I think it's a good idea. - You do? - Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. You can free this young lady, inspector. No use adding unlawfulness to your incompetence. Unless you, my dear...? You're free to go, miss. Thank you, sir. Mr. Prime Minister. Strange little girl. Yep. All this doesn't help much. This is not the right way. It's the way we came from. - I hadn't noticed. - Freedom is this way. I choose freedom them. I'll ask the hotel management to take you back. Thanks but no thanks. I'd rather starve. Goodbye, inspector. As you like. Goodbye, miss. - So, you saw something? - Nothing at all. I'll go back then. I was sure that they would not keep you long. How did you get in? Through the door. You've got nerve! I admit I'm in the wrong. You admit it! Very nice of you. But I've lost my job. And I've spent the night in jail. Wait! 50 louis. That's for the night you spent in jail. And I apologize. As for your job, go to this address tomorrow morning. You'll be hired as a manicurist there. Charles Dogor, at the Palais Royal. I know the place. Go there at 9. Show that card. Give them your name, and they'll hire you right away. You are recommended by Grand Duke Michel. The Czar's uncle. No need to show me out. I know the way. Charles Dogor, Man's hairdresser. Monsieur... I'd like to have a word with your new manicurist. What about, monsieur? I'm sorry but employees can't receive visitors. - I won't be a minute. - Please... Haircut, shampoo, manicure. - Is Mr. Blondeau pleased? - Of course. Inspector, please don't disturb me while I'm at work. Calm down, my child. Tell me... Does one of these characters bear any resemblance to Lupin? This one for instance. No. That one? That one? Mr. Laroche! How nice to see you! Your hairdresser is free. Good! Shampoo, manicure. Miss... I've got a customer, inspector. - How long will it take? - 20 minutes at least. Let go of me, will you! I'll be back in twenty minutes. - How are you, Mr. Laroche? - Hello, Fr?d?ric. - Well, Laroche! - Hello! - Will we see you at Countess Kieffer's? - Perhaps, perhaps. Bravo for yesterday. Your mare won once again. - Well, a 1000 louis prize! - You're hard to please. - Your horses cost you. - Money's there to be spent. Nice weather today, isn't it? How is the famous Laroche feeling? Quite well. What about your infamous newspaper? My infamous paper is well too. - See you later. - Quite so. Monsieur... Your hand please! Indeed, miss. - Excuse me, monsieur. - Sorry, miss. Lovely! Does monsieur think that his horse Mirliflor might win this afternoon at Chantilly? He won't. The track will be much too dry for him. Monsieur... Sorry! Miss, it's the second time I've given you my hand. I should beware, shouldn't I, Fr?d?ric? Come on, Mr. Laroche, you won't be a bachelor all your life. Handsome as you are, it would be a pity. You're right. I'll get married and have many children. Good morning, Mr. Poirier. - What's that? - A rub, monsieur. - What fragrance? - Royal fern. A new one. - You must be crazy. - Why, monsieur? How dare you offer me one of your awful perfumes? What did you do with mine? Did you drink it? Sorry, Mr. Laroche. I had forgotten. Thank heavens, he didn't drink it all. Monsieur, your hand please. This time, my child, it's for life. You couldn't put it better, Mr. Lupin. Look, that's him, Lupin! I've tied him up. Lupin, you're done. - I, Ars?ne Lupin? - Yes, you. You can laugh. It's over! This is ridiculous! Monsieur is known in Parisian society. He is a millionaire. You're perfect! He is perfect. And you are very good. I'd never seen you act before but you're remarkable. I'll tell G?mier about you. No, Berlustel. He'll most certainly give you a part. - But he's a real policeman! - My dear Charles, you didn't understand. They didn't tell you because you wouldn't have accepted it. But look at this gentleman. He is obviously a professional actor. He was most certainly paid by someone here, right? Besides, we'll find that someone. He is most certainly here. I want to know who did this. I'll know who did it. - He did! - I? - You did, Gauthier! - Never in life! The joke is obviously a journalist's. You swine, you did it? I'll make you pay. The truth, miss. He staged that joke, didn't he? What did you give her in exchange? Well, what's wrong with her? Give me some water. No, a wet towel will be better. Well? Thank you! Help me! Can't you see she's falling down? I've got nothing to do with this. No, please! Take those off. They're a nuisance. I can assure you it's not me. She's feeling better. Well, miss, where were you? Come on, Lupin, the show is over. Come with me. Stop it, I've had enough. Who are you anyway? - Inspector Dufour? - Yes indeed, pal. Well that's another story. Remove these at once, will you! Did you hear what I said, my friend? You're making a fool of yourself. - Everyone in Paris knows him but you. - Who are you? Jacques Gautier, editor of "Le Petit Journal." So what? A journalist's testimony means nothing. I'll give you a testimony that you won't forget any time soon. - Hello, miss... - I'm listening, monsieur. Sorry, I was angry. Can you get me Police Headquarters? - The police? - Yes, it's an emergency. - Hello, Police Headquarters. - Hello, Police Headquarters? - Yes Monsieur. - Can I have the Pr?fet, please? - The Pr?fet? - Yes, himself. Mr. Paul Desfontaines. - Don't hang up, sir. - All right. I'll wait. I was about to suggest it. Hello? Paul? - Himself. - Andr? speaking. - Which Andr?? - Andr? Laroche. Oh, it's you, Andr?? - Andr?? - Yes, Andr?. - I was just talking about you 5 minutes ago. - With whom? With whom? You're too curious, my dear friend. Say, did you get home all right yesterday night? Quite all right. But not alone. That's why I'm calling you. Thank you, dear friend, she's lovely. - Indeed. - You're quite a good guest. - You too, dear friend. - Me too? Of course! - We're both bachelors, aren't we? - Indeed. A good situation, the best! By the way, what are you doing tomorrow night? - Whatever you like. - Great, you're the king of pr?fets. Why don't you come for supper around midnight? We'll be six. - Six men? - Of course not, dear friend. Only two. You and I. That's enough, isn't it? See you tomorrow. Well, dear fellow, is that convincing enough? Now if you need more testimonies, I can also phone the President. Andr?, you'll give me those ladies' names. Names! I need names! - I need a story. - My cane, my hat! - Come on, Andr?. - Leave me alone. - I won't leave you alone. - Jacques, you're a real nuisance. You'll most certainly invite ??? and Miss Folleville Not on your life! Besides, I don't even know them. That's enough. Let me get through. I want to leave. - Where are you going? - Back home. - Quite the blown lead. - Inspector, I think that you're a fool. Wait for us, Inspector! I'll be watching you. - I'll follow the policeman. - And I, the manicurist. Inspector, you're under arrest. You're really not funny. - What do you want? - I advise you to buy "Le Petit Journal" - tomorrow morning. - What for? You'll be in the headlines. You'll be glad. You'll see. Miss... Miss! - Why are you running away? - What do you want, Monsieur? I haven't tipped you. Why were you running away? You were afraid? - Not as much as you. - I was afraid? Not any more. But a while ago, you were afraid. Why on earth? Because you are Ars?ne Lupin. Miss! - I read that Monsieur was arrested. - Yes, I was arrested. But I am not Ars?ne Lupin, unfortunately. It's a pity! I would have liked it! Instead of saying foolish things, give me my paper. A new plague: lupinity . An awful mistake. Thinking she recognized Lupin, the Meurice young manicurist has a known parisian personality arrested. Inspector Dufour makes a fool of himself. My dear friend, you forgot the sugar. Excuse me, Sire, but I only wanted to know if that young man could understand French. The hiding place is ready, Sire. I'd like you to see it. Mina, you're extraordinary. If you were in charge of the French police, I'm sure that you'd know how to find that Ars?ne Lupin. I might, Sire. Because I found out who he was 15 minutes ago. Well really! What do you mean, my dear? So who is he? He is very well known in Paris, Your Majesty. And no one knows that this celebrity is also Ars?ne Lupin. Today is really your day. I'm really surprised. I'm really curious to see this. Sorry, my dear, but your French perfume is wasted. I'll have another one bought tomorrow. Your Majesty is too kind. This machine is a masterpiece. I like that hiding place, Mina. - It will be very useful. - Really, Sire? Really very useful. Good because I felt that Your Majesty was not happy with our secret machine. I apologize but I was thinking of something else. I was thinking of Ars?ne Lupin. You said earlier that you knew him under another name. - That's right, Sire. - In that case, do whatever it takes to have him come here. I'd really like to meet him. - Really, Sire? - Really. I hope this will be possible. Everything is possible to serve your Majesty. My dear baroness, you're a remarkable woman. What would I do without you? But do things quickly; I give you carte blanche. I think only of you yet you're giving me a rough ride. - You're the man I need. - I? - You're leaving for Paris. - At once? At once! Come into my office, I'll tell you. - You're a real tyrant, my dear. - Shut up! You annoy me. - Hello? - Mr. Laroche, for Mrs. de Fleurville. I think Monsieur has gone out. I'll check. Monsieur, it's Mrs. de Fleurville. Monsieur has gone out. - Tell him that I phoned. - I'll tell him, madame. - Thank you. - Goodbye, madam. - She didn't believe you. - I don't know, Monsieur. She seems much interested in Monsieur. She phones every day. Many are much interested in me these days. Far too much, I'd say. Good morning. Anything to declare? Nothing. - There? - Personal things. - I apologize. - Apologies accepted. Fifteen minutes pass quickly. What now? We're changing cars. I see. Connection time. Very good. Auf wiedersehen, gentlemen! Nice castle! It's one of the summer mansions of His Majesty the Emperor. Ah! I see! Mr. Laroche, you're going to meet our Emperor. Really? Great! The person you were waiting for has just arrived, Sire. I'm delighted, Mina. But if you'll excuse me... I hope that your Majesty will at last tell me what he intends to do with that person. One second! Good morning, Mr. Laroche. Look... Tell me what you think of this horse. It's a fine horse, Sire. It's Mandragore's son if I'm not mistaken. Very good, Mr. Laroche. You are right, it's a scion of Balthazar and Mandragore. How did you know? I saw the mother in a race in Liverpool eight years ago. But tell me what you think of this young horse, I'm interested. Well, to speak frankly, Sire, he doesn't look in good shape. A bit overtrained maybe. You were right, my dear. Mr. Laroche knows horses well. And dance too, your Majesty. I indeed had the pleasure of waltzing with the baroness at a Parisian party. Mina told me the story. The Prime Minister's ball. The paintings. I found that quite amusing, monsieur. Go and get settled in, monsieur. I'll see you later. I'm very pleased, my dear. Your friend has made a good impression on me. He is not my friend, Sire. - Your Majesty? - Yes. Why did you make him come? To get to know him, my dear. You know that. Permit me to withdraw, Sire. I'll go ride my mare. Go, my dear, go. - Charming woman. - Yes. Here we are. That's Otto. He is at your service. He speaks some French. - Morning, Otto. - Good morning, monsieur. Well, well! Nice cloth! Goodness! German organisation is beautiful! Very simple! I went to see your usual suppliers and - they have your measurements, right? - Bravo! - Besides, your providers are also mine. - Bravo again! Why are they going through here? There's only one door for the whole apartment, my Lord. I'll leave you, Mr. Laroche. I hope you'll have all you need. My dear, I'll be in clover. Thank you very much. Good evening, monsieur. See you later! Well, if that's how it is, I'll have my bath. Beautiful tub! Solid copper! Smell good, monsieur! Guerlain! Paris! French newspapers, Monsieur! - Le Gaulois, L'?cho de Paris. - Perfect. Thank you. If monsieur needs me, he rings, please. Thank you. If you want to make me a happy man, Marguerite, Marguerite, If you want to make me a happy man, Marguerite, give me your heart. If you give me your heart, Mina belle, Mina Belle, If you give me your heart, I'll make you happy. Come in. Allow me, Sire. Thank you, Mr. Laroche. Let us sit, will you? - You won't sit down? - Thank you. Tell me, monsieur, are you comfortable enough? Certainly. I've even had an excellent bath. In a superb tub. I'm really delighted to meet you. As am I. Monsieur Lupin! At your Majesty's orders. To tell the truth, I did not have you come here only to have the pleasure of meeting you. I had an idea. It concerns something very important. - For me. - Well, Sire, if it's very important, I'll ask you to wait a while. I have, in my administration, someone quite remarkable but that person has, strangely enough, a passion for electricity. What a strange taste! Don't you think? Especially for a pretty woman. Well, monsieur, nothing can be hidden from you. You see, monsieur, I still use oil lamps. I hate electricity. You are right, sire, it's barbaric lightning. But it won't be abandoned any time soon, unfortunately. Otto, no need to search, it's right here. God! What must I do to get what I want, - without being spied on? - But, Sire, do as I do. You don't always do what you want, monsieur. You're here, against your will. - Am I wrong? - No, of course not, Sire. I'm getting now to why you're here. Let's see... A little problem, monsieur. Given a hiding place, a very secret one, in my castle, on this floor. If Ars?ne Lupin, at liberty to search the premises as he pleases, does not succeed in discovering this hiding place in... let's say two days, you're following me? Right... What would be the odds of this for a spy himself often obliged to hide? None, Sire. In either case the hiding would be well done. I need to be sure of the safety of a hiding place that I've had built. And where I want to put away safely personal documents and things of value. Will you take 48 hours to search for this secret hiding place? And if you find it, would you try to open up this hiding place? Sire, you did tell me that the hiding place is situated on this actual floor? On this very floor. I won't need 48 hours. Tomorrow, I'll be gone. - So soon? - But I must, Sire. Besides, I have things to do in Paris. I am a very busy man, you know. What's more, I've arranged to have you compensated. No, I must. What would you say to a sum matching the yearly income of your... of your parisian activities. Let's say 100,000 marks. I'd be really curious to know how your Majesty got to that figure. My administration has worked out statistics about you. Do you agree with their calculations? They may be right, I don't add it up. I'll add that if you manage to open the hiding place, you'll find quite a beautiful ring in it. that you will be allowed to keep, as a souvenir of me. I accept, Sire. I adore souvenirs. You haven't got it yet. No, Sire but I'll have it soon. - Really? - I believe so. Thank you. Really, my dear, I like you a lot. A pity you're not German, monsieur. I would have done something for you. Sire, I'm pleased to be French. For the tranquility of your police. I'm really pleased to know you. Good evening. You frightened me! - You don't say "tu" now? - I hate you! - Listen, Mina, I don't understand. - Enough! Why are you here anyway? Andr?! Don't play the fool! If you take it that way, I won't tell you anything. I'm listening to you. I'll explain it to you. I've got to search everywhere. Search everywhere? Why? Because I'm being paid to do it. And do you know who is paying? The Emperor pays you. But what for, please? I'm looking for a hiding place. An extraordinary hiding place which is very difficult to find. Does that mean anything to you? Never mind! I'll look on my own. I know nothing about a hiding place. - I'll find it without your help. - Andr?! - Not now. - Why not? You'll be late for the hunting party. His Majesty will be mad. I am not going. That's madness. You must! - Not at all, I do as I please. - The Emperor invited you. But that meant nothing, just out of courtesy. What's more, I slept badly, I'm very tired. - Truly. - Yes, I'm only a little man, a poor little Frenchman. A very little one. Andr?... Let's go to my place, shall we? No, I must search first. This hiding place... I know, I feel that I'm going to find it. Let's see. But who told you that it was in this room? My little finger! Nice fish tank! You're wasting your time, you know. I don't know. That remains to be seen. That's odd! Come here! What's wrong? It smells like Mina here near the fish tank. Let's see! Now that you're here, I smell nothing but you. Delicious, actually. These fish are very pretty. Aren't they? In any case, the fish tank is wonderful. I'll have one like this made at home. With running water. Andr?! What's with you? Andr?, I beg you. The Emperor will be waiting for you, he'll be mad at you. It will make a very bad impression, you know. - Ingenious. - Yes, come on. - That's odd. - What now? Come on! - Wait! I'm thinking of something. - What? Why is that tap hidden? So that it's prettier. Indeed! I could have worked that out by myself. Come on, Andr?! Wait! You're not a child any more, Andr?! Oh yes I am. That's idiotic! It will overflow. There! The people who devised that are artists. Poets. It's lovely. Very lovely! Fine stone, isn't it? I can keep it if I want to. Your Emperor said to me: if you manage to open the hiding place, you'll find a beautiful ring there, that you may keep as a souvenir of me. It's very elegant, isn't it? Goodbye! That's it! You put the ring back. Why? I must tell you something. I rather like your Guillaume. Which Guillaume? Your Emperor! I find him appealing. If I tell I found his hiding place, he'll be disappointed, it will ruin his pleasure. I want him to keep his nice hiding place. So listen to me: he mustn't be told. It's a deal? I hope I can count on you. Where are you going? To see the Emperor. To tell him about your success. Let go! Let me go! Let go of me! Let go of me! A little tip! On behalf of Guillaume. Sorry, Majesty, your statistics are inaccurate! Mina! Your Lupin is a thief. He took one million marks. Mina, where are you going? Gentlemen! Quick! Quick! Did you see that Frenchman leave? Yes, your Majesty. We saw him one minute ago. Why are you speaking French? Why am I still speaking French? Such a hiding place is worth a million marks. - Baroness, it's a real joy. - Have you seen Mr. Laroche? - No, not for several days. - Where shall we sit? Your Ladyship didn't reserve a table? No, why? I have nothing left. At this hour... It's midnight. Your Lordship should have phoned. We arrived tonight. A woman's whim. There's a free table. Unfortunately, it's not free. It's Mr. Laroche's. But since he is not here. He might come. I can't give his table up. I'll take it. Your Ladyship, I can't let you. That table is reserved all year long. Mr. Laroche is a friend of mine. I'll settle it with him. I'll see your Ladyship later. Mr. Paul, there's no Pommery 1906 left. Yes there's some in the Reserve. Go! You're really the most dynamic woman I know. Next to you, my dear Rudolf, everyone is dynamic. I know. Isn't that the same maharajah who was at the Prime Minister's party? Of course, it's the Bindapuhr rajah. Look... He wears on his turban the famous Hiyama Annapurna, a 70 carat stone. A priceless gem. Excuse me. That waiter is very clumsy. He is. What will you have?
