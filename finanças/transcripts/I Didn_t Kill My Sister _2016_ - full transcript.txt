( On laptop ) Moving now to Money Matters with China taking yet another nosedive today losing more than 20 percent as money surged in and out of the marketplace. In contrast, U.S. stocks closed with only a two percent drop amid more discouraging developments in the Greece debt talks. And Carmen, it's been a real roller coaster ride. Do you have any advice for the California investor? Stick to those long term goals and understand your risk tolerance, which you've never been good at. Ouch. And for those husbands out there, try investing in a nice anniversary ring. The market may be plummeting, but it's not too late to save your love life. And we'll have more after the break. What a goddamn mess. ( Glass smashes ) Oh, my god! Agh!!!! ( News anchor ) The battle of the exes continues in family court with City View news anchors Carmen and Mason Campbell slugging it out for custody of their 15-year-old daughter. Carmen! A word for your fans? Lois, I have no comment except to say that I will fight to the death for the custody of my daughter, Brooke. Of course, my client is speaking metaphorically. Carmen is Brooke's mother and can provide the home that's required for a 15-year-old girl. Brooke deserves a loving, nourishing environment, not a... well, to live with a playboy father who's home is little more than a bordello... Are you saying Mason Campbell has been unfaithful? Once the records are made public, you can all decide for yourselves. Sandra, would that mean the case is over? No more questions. Carmen! Mason!! Sources say that the couple cannot stand to be in the same room, but their City View contract binds them to work together every evening at the news desk. Mason! Uh, is it true that Carmen called you a "playboy" today in court? I only want what's best for my daughter. But, in fact, her lawyer just said, and used the word... Shut it off. A bordello? I heard rumors. That's kind of an extreme rumor. Oh, my dear, Heather, after all these years you have learned so little. It's called "playing the game". I nail Mason in the press, it filters into the court room. Ugh. I spend five thousand a month battling HD. But you, you never have to worry about your looks. Maybe I could get some big diamond earrings and distract from these wrinkles. Forget it. Fillers will be cheaper. Have Dr. Sing fit me in on Tuesday. Just the forehead? Do I look like I need more? No, no. You look beautiful as always, Carmen. Well, on that note, it's showtime. And for our final story, money doesn't heal all wounds, but it certainly helps the victims of the Belford Insurance scandal who finally won an out-of-court settlement after a five year battle. Tune in tomorrow for a special workplace report on California's strong payroll gains and healthy job growth. The people of this great state have a lot to be proud of and we look forward to bringing you that report. Until then, this is Mason Campbell wishing you a safe and good evening. I'm Carmen Campbell, and thank you for making your view a City View. Goodnight, California. That's a wrap. Nice work, people. Jerry, could you please remind Mason to lighten up? I heard a better sign-off at my mother's funeral. Oh, thank you,erry. I heard her. Heather, can you have my car brought around back? This forehead is not ready for TMZ. Yeah, I'll take care of it. Thank you, my dear. Oh, Michael. Hey, Heather. Can you quietly bring Carmen's car around back to the loading dock? Sure. Yeah. Quietly. Sure. It can't be easy for you being stuck in the middle of World War III. Well, Carmen's my sister, but Mason's still my brother-in-law. Yeah, but remember it's Carmen that brings in the ratings. Yeah, she calls the shots so she goes to the competition. Did she say something to you? No. You nearly gave me a coronary. Remember to power down when we're done, Heather. Yeah. Our secret. Alright. Michael, are you wearing a new cologne? I switched to a new deodorant. Well, whatever it is you smell like an air freshener. Please remind Jerry of our fragrance-free policy. Yes, Miss Campbell. I said no press. Uh, there must have been a misunderstanding with Heather. Oh, it's ok. I'll escort them out. And finally, money doesn't heal all wounds, but... ( clears throat ) But it certainly helps the victims of the Belford Insurance scandal... argh. Who finally won an out-of-court settlement after a five year battle. I wish them well. No. I'm your host, Heather Pearson. ( Sighs ) Your host, Heather Pearson. The manhunt ended in a deadly crash to- You're good, Heather. It's really good, you just need someone to roll the teleprompter for you. Uh, Jerry lets me in here. No, no. It was great. Sit down. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk to you. I'm not taking sides, Mason. Well, you were born on her side. Well, not by choice. Listen, I just wanted to say that I- I hope that when this whole divorce thing is all said and done that we can still be friends. Yeah. Yeah? That's good, because I can certainly give you some pointers on your delivery, too, if you like. Ok. Ok, so posture first. Good. Chin up, back straight. Very nice, very nice. Ok, let's go from camera one to camera two. And no. It's eyes first, then the head. Eyes first and then the head. You always keep eye contact with your audience because that's how you build trust. Now, who are you to the audience? The newscaster? No. No, Heather, you're so much more than a talking head. To men, you are "unattainable sex object". And to women, their best friend. Is that Carmen's secret? Let's make it your secret. I'm truly sorry. I know this whole thing with Carmen has been a mess for you, too. It's ok. ( Clears throat ) I feel like Carmen's being an extreme bitch about this whole divorce. I just wish that she'd get out of the picture. You know, Heather, you can be your own person and still be Carmen's sister. Easy for you to say. You were just her husband. Ah! God, Brooke, you scared the crap out of me! Well, hello to you, too. Why aren't you at your mother's? Carmen's having another one of her "late night meetings". Who's that cow kidding? Hey, that's your mother! Yeah, and if it wasn't for dad she would have sent me off to boarding school a long time ago. Well, are you at least settling into the house? No, I hate it. I'm going to move out. Oh, I don't think the court's gonna let you do that. Well the court can shove it. Look, I know what I want. You know, sometimes in life, Brooke, you don't always get- Spare me the speech, please. Well, do you at least like the pool? No. It's the worst. It's just a big, germy cesspool of floating bugs. Oh, god. Does she make you clean it? Ok, you know what? She did. She did once and it was horrible. Oh, you poor child. Does she at least feed you? Speaking of which, I already at that half lasagna that was in the fridge. That was two weeks old. Are you serious? Yeah. No. ( Laughs ) That was for breakfast. Ok, if we're gonna do this slumber party thing then we need movies and popcorn. Aunt Heather, how is it that you and my mom are sisters? You're so nice and she's such a- I ask myself that question every day. Popcorn coming up! ( Heather ): I watched all of those movies when I was your age. You have to see these things. They, like, shape you. Get inside, young lady. Next time you decide to have a sleepover at Heather's you better ask me. I can't deal with this! Thank you for putting up with that. It's no problem, really. She's an angel for you. Honestly, you have no idea how difficult she's become. Come, you have to look at my flowers. I planted them a couple of days ago. Cosmos. A wild flower. A friend of mine says they're quite calming. You know, Brooke's taking this pretty hard. I know. But talking to that girl is like talking to a brick wall. Well, maybe you should try listening to her. What are you, my therapist now? No, I'm your sister. I'm telling you, you're gonna lose her. There's a whole world out there, Carmen, that you can't control. The network made Mason an offer he can't refuse. His own show in Oregon. He'll never leave Brooke. It's a face-saving promotion to placate him and keep me. We'll settle out of court, of course, and the documents will be sealed. So you're just gonna wave your wand and make things go your way? Heather, I'm sensing a lot of attitude from you these days. Don't make this about me. Have you ever thought about what's best for Brooke? Of course I have. Do you think about what's best for Mason? Excuse me? If I didn't know better, I'd say you have a thing for him. I'm just thinking about what's best for my niece. You always did want everything that was mine. I don't have to listen to this. ( sighs ) This sucks! You can't keep me locked up in this place! I have to because you are out of control! You keep sneaking out. Because I can't take it anymore! This house is like a prison! I am your mother! You will do what you're told! ( Slams door ) I HATE YOU! ( Breaks glass ) ( splash ) So why did you go to journalism school? I feel like I could make a difference on camera. Yeah, but right now you're really not being given that opportunity. I'm paying off my student loans. Yeah, with a salary that Carmen considers to be charity? Carmen is always gonna hold you down unless you do something about it. I don't want to believe that. I'm sorry, you've got enough on your plate without me preaching. No, you're not preaching, you're just helping me keep my eye on the prize. Yeah, 'cause I want what's best for you. If I'm ever pushing too hard, please let me know. No, no. You're not. Mason, I need to tell you something. You can tell me anything. I think that Carmen thinks there's something between us. Why would she think that? Because you're my friend. Because I care about you. Heather, thank you. Thank you for caring. Mason- You know, Carmen's right. I've been wanting to do that for a really long time. Uh... I should probably go. Are you sure? Uh, yeah. I have to pick up Carmen for an appointment. Ok. Hey, listen, if that was too sudden- No, no, no. It was uh... it's just... Thank you for being in my corner. Brooke needs her father in her life. ( Scream from outside ) Brooke! Brooke! Oh my god! Call 911! Call 911!! Carmen! ( sirens ) This ring must be worth 10 K. We can rule out robbery. Time of death? Core temperature puts the body in the water for 16 to 18 hours. Between six and eight. It looks like she drank too much, slipped, and splashed. Maybe. But if she was drunk enough to drown she would have slipped long before she reached the edge. Especially in that dress. Follow up on the toxicology report. I want it before anyone else. Yes, ma'am. ( Sobbing ) I spent the night at my friend Becky's house. Her mom drove me home and I found her. Is this even necessary? It is, Miss Pearson. Brooke, can I talk to your aunt alone for a minute? Do you mind going up to your room? No. It'll just be for a minute. Could you do that for me, please? It's ok, sweetie. I'll be up soon, ok? Ok. Did your sister often drink alone? Sometimes. I... I don't think recently. And what was her state of mind? I already told this to the other officer. Now you can tell me. Her state of mind. She was happy. She... she just moved in here. Her career was going well. Heather. Where's Brooke? She's upstairs. This is horrible. Are you ok? Mason Campbell, Detective Cruz, homicide. Homicide? Do... do you think somebody did this? I'm going to find that out. Right now all we know is that she drowned. I just- I just don't understand. Where were you both last night? I was- I was home alone. Miss Pearson? Uh, I was at the station until 5:00 and then I went home. If need be, can you back up your whereabouts between 6:00 and 8:00 with witnesses? No, I- I was alone. We were in the middle of a divorce, I was preparing my side of the case. I just watched a movie and went to bed. ( sobbing ) ( Brooke ): I didn't really want her dead. I might have said that, but I didn't. Miss Pearson? Yeah. If you think of anything. And you might want to call your sister's lawyer and let them know. ( Phone rings ) Hello? Sandra, it's so awful. Heather, I'm so sorry. It's just so shocking. Are you ok? ( Sobbing ) I'm just overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. Look, I'll take care of everything, alright? There's a copy of the will on file and I'll handle all the media and all the details. You just don't worry about a thing. Ok, Heather? Thank you. ( On TV ) A comment on the tragedy? Well, it's a deep, deep loss for my daughter and I, and um... you know, Carmen had thousands of fans. We would just like to thank them for their support in our time of grief and ask that we be given some privacy. Thank you. Thank you. This is Lois Summer for City News ( Phone rings ) Watkins. The tox report found a narcotic in the deceased's system. Too bad about Carmen. Let's pause a moment to reflect on the great names of television journalism. Edward R Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and David Brinkley. And now, sadly, one more name has been added to that pantheon. Lois has found exactly the right tone. She's good. Our own Carmen Campbell. Carmen was a mentor and my friend. I miss her deeply, and while I may be sitting in her seat I know that I will never fill her shoes completely. If you're just joining us this morning- She's gonna be a problem. In an unexpected announcement police have determined Carmen Campbell was murdered. Her husband and co-host Mason Campbell is in custody for questioning. Stay tuned for City View for the latest updates. Miss Pearson? Mason Campbell is still being questioned. You can't be here. What are you holding him on? I can't discuss that. He didn't do this! Given the right circumstances anyone is capable of murder. Mason! Heather! It's ok. We're ok. Ok, we're gonna get through this. It's just circumstantial evidence, but with an overzealous DA and public pressure this could really destroy my reputation so I think it's best if we just don't see each other for a while, ok? But I want to be there to support you. Yeah, but we also have to be smart. Listen, Carmen's murder is the number one news story in the country. We're all under microscopes and we just need to let this settle down, ok? Now, call me if you need to but otherwise let's just lay low. Ok. Alright. I understand. ( Knocks on door ) Michael. Michael, can you let me in? Sorry, Heather. You're not allowed inside. Oh, really? Jerry's orders. Well, go get him. I'll call security if I have to. Fine, call them! Jerry! Jerry- Heather. I'm just here to pick up some more of Carmen's things, ok? Just in and out? Yes. Ok. Five minutes 'till we go. Check that copy. Hey, Jerry? Yeah? I'll take those overnights first thing in the morning. I'll send them before I read them myself. And uh, I think we might want a new chair. This one's a little lumpy. I'll order a new one. Okay. Michael, Lois needs a new chair right now. On it! ( On TV ) Our coverage of this all-too-personal tragedy continues. With me now is the person who perhaps knew Carmen best these last few months. Joining me is Sandra Conroy, Carmen's lawyer and friend. Thank you for being here. Carmen meant a lot to so many. Have the police contacted you? Yes, I've been assisting with the investigation. Could Mason really be a suspect in this homicide? I know Mason Campbell and I doubt that he could do something like this. Mason, it's Lois Summer. Good afternoon Lois and Sandra. We've been having a really difficult time- here at City View today, I can imagine how hard this must be for you as well. Well, I'm devastated, Lois. Carmen and I shared a life together for 16 years. It's difficult to comprehend she's gone, especially for my daughter. Understandable. Any updates from the police? Well, I can certainly understand the police's interest in uh, investigating all the "loose ends" as they put it, but to be blunt publicity is driving this case not the evidence. Do you have an alibi, Mason? No, that's one of the loose ends. Sandra, is it true that Carmen was in the process of updating her will? It's standard practice during a divorce to update a will. Is it also true that, had Carmen died a week later, Mason would not be the sole beneficiary of her estate? I resent that insinuation, Lois. Nice. Nice. Close on her. Yes, Brooke would have received everything in trust. Miss Conroy, if you were Mason's council, what would you advise him? Well, if I was advising him he wouldn't be doing this TV program, be keeping a lower profile. I know a little about handling the media, Miss Conroy. Well, you're certainly not demonstrating it. I suggest you get a good lawyer, Mason. Like you? Yes, like me. Mason, did I just hear you ask Sandra to represent you? Yes. Yes, Sandra, since I need a good lawyer so badly, why don't you defend me? Call my office. I will. Wow. Thank you, Mason. And thank you for the air time, Lois. I just want to say to all my fans, please keep the faith I'm innocent. Stay tuned here for more on the Carmen Campbell murder as it happens. This is Lois Summer for City View. And we are in commercial. Sandra! Sandra! Sandra. I don't have much time. I know, it's important. You don't really think Mason did this? It's up for the judge to decide. I- I really think that you should represent him. There's other lawyers that- No, there's not! Look, I trust you. My sister trusted you. Ok, if he calls I'll meet with him and then I'll decide, alright? Ok. Ok. One minute people! Clear the stage!! Don't worry, I'm leaving. ( Phone rings ) Hello? ( Brooke ): Heather, I'm scared. What is it? Just come over here, please? I'm on my way. Brooke? Brooke! Brooke? Oh, honey. They're both gone. My mom's dead and my dad's gonna go to jail. No, nobody's going to jail. There's no way my dad killed her. I know, he's a great person. They used to fight, but... He couldn't. Mason is one of the best people that I've ever known. Do you think that they're gonna find the killer soon? I hope so. Dad! Wait, Brooke. Brooke! Oh, it's ok. It's ok. Once the DA saw Sandra standing next to me, he just buckled. They examined the evidence and they were able to exclude Mason. Come on, let's get you guys inside. Thank you. I wish I could take all the credit but the facts, they just spoke for themselves. Do they have any new leads? Uh, it sounds like a few. Listen, I don't want to scare you, but you may be called in for more questioning. Why? Am I a suspect? You may be. And I also need to let you know that as your friend I can advise you on whatever happens but I can't represent you and Mason both. Ok. Um... now you've officially scared me. Everything is going to be fine. Here you go, this is Wayne Hamilton. He is a great lawyer and he's a really good friend. Thanks. Yeah, it's good to be prepared. Come on. Do you want some more coffee? Yeah. Hey, uh, Heather. Thank you so much for looking after Brooke. I mean, I know I can always count on you. Mason, I'm so happy for you. Mason, we should go over these probate documents. Hi, can I get an order for delivery, please. Yeah. I should probably get going. Heather. Listen, about the other day... Oh, it's- it's ok. I'll call you later. Ok. Bye, Brooke. Here, take a look at those. Yeah. ( Reporter ): Here she comes, go, go!! ( Reporters clamoring ) Miss Pearson... ( Phone ringing ) I'm sorry. Hello? Miss Pearson? It's Detective Cruz. Yes? I have a few follow-up questions. Right now? I can send a car for you. No, that's ok. Can you meet me at your sister's place in half an hour? Uh, yeah, sure. I'll be there. Do you have an attorney, Miss Pearson? What? Uh, no. Why, do I need one? Let's meet first and then you can decide. You had a fight with Carmen the day she died. We're sisters, we fought all the time. What'd you fight about? Mason. The divorce. I felt like she was being unfair to him. She wanted him out of the way. Oregon. How did you know about that? We have our sources. You and Mason have a close relationship, don't you? We're friends. Being Carmen's sister and personal assistant must have been difficult at times. No more than any other job. Am I a suspect? Yeah, you are. There's a lot of unanswered questions. I don't think I should say anything else. That's your choice, but don't leave town. And you better get that lawyer! ( Phone ringing ) Ok, come on Mason, pick up. Come on, pick up the phone. ( Phone ringing ) Uh, hi. Yes, I'm looking for Mr. Hamilton? This is he. Uh, yes. Sandra Conroy referred me to you. Um, I'd like to set up an appointment. ( Doorbell rings ) Hey. Hi. Can I help you? Uh, you don't look much like your sister. Mr. Hamilton. Expecting somebody else? Can I come in? Yeah. Thanks for uh, thanks for letting me drop by. Those damn office renovations. Can I get you something? Some water or... Beer? It's a scorcher out there. How do you know Sandra? Oh, she throws me a bone now and then. Mr. Hamilton, um... Wayne, please. Oh, hi. Wayne. Um, I- I appreciate that you come highly recommended, but um, I'm gonna need some time to think this over. Time is something you don't have a lot of, Miss Pearson. The police hate publicity. They want to put this to bed fast. And I'm their only suspect. Who was Carmen seeing, anyone? No, not that I know of. It's the biz. There's always someone. Twice a week she would drop her daughter off here and we thought she might be meeting up with someone. Hmm. Details? None. People will often buy a second cell phone. You know, rent a place. Did she? Maybe a second SIM card? No. Carmen didn't have a second phone, she wasn'tery technical. Look, Wayne, um... someone is feeding the police information about me. They knew that Mason was going to Oregon and that I got into a fight with Carmen just before she died. I- I need you to find out who their source is. Do you have the key to her house? Yeah. Ok, I'll poke around and see what I can find, ok? ( Phone rings ) Oh, don't talk to the police. No, this is the TV station. Uh, the code is 3222. 3222. Thank you so much, Wayne. Yeah, I'll be in touch. Hello? Hey, it's Jerry. Can you come into my office? Thanks for the beer. We need to talk. Uh, yeah. I'll be right there. I owe you an apology. Get to the point, Jerry. We all miss you, Heather. You miss me, or you miss my sister? Heather, please. You and the station were all bottom feeders before my sister got here five years ago. She deserves some respect. That's not fair. Lois hosted a prime time special celebrating Carmen's life just the other day. See you around, Jerry. Wait. I want you to work on air. On air? You can start on Sunday. What's the catch? No catch. Just you, in front of the camera, reporting live. Reporting on what? For Carmen's funeral, Lois wants to host a special. The best of Carmen. You do a remote from the service reporting on camera. You introduce Carmen's best moments to the audience, we show some tasteful clips, maybe you offer a few anecdotes from behind the scenes. I can't believe you'd even ask me that. Heather! This is a great opportunity. It could start your career! Think about it. ( Thud ) Oh, please! Please don't! Please don't!!! No!!! Mason, can you please call me as soon as you get this message? Ok, bye. ( sirens ) There have been some new developments. What kind of developments? I want to talk to my lawyer. Wayne Hamilton was found at Carmen's house this morning, dead. Someone used your security code to gain entry. A trophy with your fingerprints on it was used to bludgeon the poor man's head to a pulp. What?! People close to you keep turning up dead, don't they, Miss Pearson? This is a search warrant. It lets us search your place. Please, wait outside. This is ridiculous. You're not gonna find anything! Your parents divorced when you were young, Carmen practically raised you. Are we just about through? Did you ever resent her fame? It must have been hard growing up in Carmen's shadow. She's so successful and married to such a handsome man. I have a sister like that. She has a beautiful life and a beautiful family and I'm happy for her, but every once in a while I get this itch, you know? A little tinge of jealousy. Do you ever feel that? Are we done? Do you ever wish you could be Carmen? Like, truly be her? I didn't kill my sister. Alprazolam. Carmen had a rather unhealthy dose just before she died. You arranged her doctor's visits, you picked up her medications. Hell, you arranged her whole life. I was her assistant. It ate you up inside. Day after day, Carmen had it all. But all you had was her. You arranged her life so you conveniently arranged her death. Arrest me, then. The Xanax killed her. Drowning was just the coup de gras. And you picked up the prescription. Six or seven months ago! Well, when the coincidences start to point in one direction, I follow. Am I under arrest? No. The DA is being careful. But I'm watching you. Thanks for the head games, Detective. But I'm not the one you should be watching. Heather! Heather Pearson! Heather Pearson, one statement! Please. Can you tell us anything about the accusations? What are you running from? Please. I- excuse me. How's Brooke? She is in her room sleeping. I mean, that kid is exhausted. This has just been so hard on her, you know? Are you alright? What is it? The police questioned me again. Heather, the police are just doing their job. I think they're convinced that I had something to do with this. What? Mason, they found Xanax in Carmen's body. I bought that prescription for her months ago. Listen, that detective is just trying to spook you. Yeah, well it worked. Because I hired a lawyer and now he's dead. Ok, this is insane. I think that they're trying to pin this on me. Come sit down. Heather, there's something that you need to know. The day after Carmen died, I found that Brooke had stashed a bag of wet clothes. Now, they smelled like chlorine. What are you talking about? Well, she knew about the medication. She could have been there that night. No. Listen, it all adds up. Carmen was a terrible parent. She made it her life's mission to destroy my relationship with Brooke. No. Even if Brooke had something to do with this, which I highly doubt, it had to have been an accident. Can we prove that? I know this sounds crazy, but look. I've been talking the whole thing through with Sandra, ok? Now, if we don't play this exactly right Brooke is going to become a suspect. Now they could prosecute her as an adult, she's old enough. No. This isn't happening. Listen to me. We cannot tell the police about this. You understand? Do not talk to Cruz anymore. It's too dangerous. Everything has to go through Sandra, ok? Ok. Ok. Brooke has everything to live for. Now, if it comes down to it I'm thinking about taking the fall. What? No. Listen, I would do anything for her. Yeah, I know you would. They're gonna find the real killer. I hope you're right. This is just tearing me apart inside. I don't know what to do. ( Reporters clamoring ) Hey, it's me. No, she won't be going to the police any time soon. Ok, bye. ( Reporters continue to clamor ) ( Rings doorbell ) He's not here. I know, I came here to talk to you. Brooke, the night that your mom died, did you go to her house? Why does it matter? Listen. If you're honest with me I can protect you. I know that you were angry with her. We had a horrible fight. I told her that I hated her. It was the last thing I said. I know, but you didn't mean it. I broke her heart. Brooke, listen to me. Did you see your mom take any pills? Did you... did you give her anything? What are you- what are you talking about? You think I killed her? She wasn't perfect, but she was my mom! I loved her! I know, I'm sorry. I know. I know you didn't do anything. ( Mason ): I'm truly sorry. I know this whole thing with Carmen has been a mess for you, too. ( Heather ): I just think she's being a supreme bitch about this whole divorce. It would be better for everyone if she was just out of the picture. You know, Heather, you can be your own person and still be Carmen's sister. Easy for you to say. You were just her husband. Now, if it's not the smoking gun it's certainly motive and intent. Why didn't you come forward with this sooner? Our editor only found it this morning. I think somebody recorded it accidentally. Well, thank you for bringing it to my attention. You were there. Did she seem unstable in any way? I think she's been unstable for a very long time. ( Phone ringing ) Mason, what's going on? Heather, where are you? The police are looking for me. Yes, and you need to turn yourself in, and the sooner the better. What? Are you crazy? I didn't do anything! I know that, but listen. You have to do the right thing here. I mean, just let the police figure it out. The police are convinced that I killed her! And why did you lie about Brooke? I didn't- I didn't lie. Yeah, you did. I talked with her. There's no way she could have killed Carmen. Listen, we don't know that. But I do know that if you keep running it's going to make you look guilty and they're gonna nail you to the wall. Ok, I can't- ( Phone rings ) Yes? Miss Pearson? It's Detective Cruz. I need to speak with you. Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Heather Pearson, sister of Carmen Campbell and now a suspect in her death. If you see Heather Pearson, do not approach her. Contact the police department immediately. What's going on? They're saying Heather murdered mom? Hey, listen. It's the same thing they did to me, ok? They treat rumors like facts and they sensationalize everything just to boost ratings. But I don't understand. Why doesn't she just turn herself in and clear it up? I don't know. I just... I hope she's ok. Oh, god, Carmen, I wish you were here. ( reads to herself ) "Six Months Clean, "Compassions Substance Abuse Centre..." Now for some of you today is an anniversary. An anniversary of a life-changing decision to take control. And look at you now. You're on a road of healing. Of personal discovery. Self-empowerment. And let me tell you something, guys. That, that is something to celebrate, ok? So I think everybody here deserves a big round of applause. ( Applause ) That's it for today. There's uh, doughnuts and muffins in the other room, please eat them or else I will. Congratulations. Good job. Hi. Hi. Uh, I'm looking for information on my sister, Carmen. Heather. Of course. She... she talked about you. She came here? Kind of. She was a... private case. We spent a lot of late nights together. Were you romantically involved? No, um... my name is Seth. Why don't we... why don't we go somewhere and talk? Let's... let's just step outside. Please, we've got a garden right through here. So this is my little sanctuary. Hey, uh you mind giving us a minute here? Sure Seth. Thanks. You know, Carmen and I used to come out here and talk for hours. You were her late night friend. I was her sober companion. Uh, she had some problems. Uh, oxycodone, vodka. She'd taken pretty much anything. I don't know why she kept that secret from me. She was embarrassed. You know what her greatest fear was? A drop in ratings? No, there was something she feared even more than that. It was you coming here. She wanted to maintain her big sister image in front of her little sister. Why was she worried about that? Trust me, she was. I mean, I talked to her twice a week for six months and she confided pretty much everything. She um... she wanted you to be proud of her. Let me tell you something. She was proud of you. Cosmos. You know the police are- Hey, listen. Your grief? That's enough to deal with right now, ok? You take care of that and let the police play their games. She was really proud of me? She was. You know, as rich as Carmen was, she had a hard life. She was consumed with the fear of failure, especially failing in front of you. I didn't know that. I think you should go. Someone may have recognized you. But look. When you're able to talk freely about this, come on back. I'm always here. Thank you, Seth. Of course. Oh hey, I wanted to ask. Did she ever fire her lawyer? Sandra? Yeah, that's the one. Carmen kept saying that her lawyer was stalling the changes to her will. I don't know. Something to look at. Let's check around back. What are you doing? ( Giggles ) Enjoying the moment. Soon you will be mine. I've always been yours. Not like this. Come here. You know... Brooke is going to be home soon. ( Giggles ) I'm worth the risk. God, I just can't get enough of you. There's just one more thing I need you to do for me. Anything. I need you to find Heather and I need you to kill her. Look at me. We are so close. Heather is inches away from taking the fall, we just can't take the chance that she knows something. Killing her was never part of the plan. Neither was killing Hamilton but we did it. It's 'cause we adapt. That's why we're such a good team. I don't know. We just have to make sure that we get to Heather before the police do. Ok? Ok. ( Phone rings ) Hello? Hello? Who is this? It's me. Heather? I just had to hear your voice. Heather, you have got to turn yourself in. Listen, uh, Sandra could come get you. I just... I just called to say goodbye. I'm leaving town. Leaving? Leaving town? The police are looking for you. You have to face this. I can't, ok? Carmen's gone. I just- I think this would be better for everyone. Wait, wait, wait. Um... uh, where are you going? Or, listen. I can help you. I can give you money. No. Just take good care of Brooke. I told you, she doesn't know anything. She's running scared. Well, if the cops find her I will just let the DA crucify her. I prefer her dead but this is acceptable. Now, we need to celebrate so if we leave right now we can go and catch a really nice dinner before I take you to the studio. You ok? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just uh... I'm a little nervous about going back on air tonight. No, you're gonna be incredible. ( Phone rings ) Cruz. ( Heather ): Watch City View tonight. It might open your eyes. Heather, please don't make this any worse for you than it already is. Just watch the show. Night Light Casino. You got to be kidding me? Heather? What are you- what are you doing? Why are you on dad's computer? Brooke, I- I can explain. I should call the police. No! No! You know I didn't do it! Of course you didn't. You love mom, you'd do anything for her, but you- you can't run from this. I'm not running. I'm trying to prove my innocence. Ok. What can I do? You can grab your computer and try and find out any information you can on Sandra Conroy, ok? Ok. Ok, come on. Did you get the link I sent you? Yep, I got it. Thank you so much. I love you. Be careful. Heather will get the chair for sure. I mean, imagine killing your own sister? I mean, I sorta see where she's coming from, I have a younger sister. They can be pretty annoying... Tonight's top story. Thank you, thank you Lois, great to be back. Good. Oh, good to be back, Lois. Tonight's top story. It's good to be back, Lois. It's great to be back. Don't be nervous, alright? The will should be probated in a month, you've got your old job back, the debt's gonna be paid off and we can send Brooke to Switzerland and then it's just you and I. It's all working out just like we planned. About sending Brooke away... Well I sure as hell didn't sign up to be her mother. Where the hell have you been? Sorry, Mr. Campbell. I got held up. They're ready for you. Ok, we'll talk about this later. Yeah. Come on, work. Yes! ( Applause ) Thank you, thank you, thank you. When I was in senior year it was my dream to work with the Mason Campbell. You were my idol ever since journalism camp. Well, so your dream has come true. Jerry. Good to see you. Lois. Hi. Mason, do you think that light is a little hot on my forehead? It looks good to me, Lois. Jerry, I think the light is a little hot on my forehead. I'll get it checked, Lois. Mason, you look fantastic. Thanks, Jerry. It's great to be back with my new co-anchor. ( Laughs ) Let's get this straight, Campbell. I'm the lead anchor and you're the co-anchor. My ratings are only one and a half points less than Carmen's. Well, it's just semantics, really. And we go live in five, four, three, two... Welcome to a special presentation. Tonight I welcome back to the City View family one of our very own, Mason Campbell. It's been a tough week for you Mason, hasn't it? Yes, Lois, it has. And thank you for saying so. I'm glad to announce that my name has been cleared but of course I'm still concerned about Carmen's sister now the police consider her to be armed and dangerous I hope she doesn't do anything else that she will later regret. As I'm sure you're well aware I know the girl quite well and it's quite a tragic story, always living in her sister's shadow. Seems like jealousy got the best of her and she snapped. I can't imagine what you've been through. Once Heather turns herself in, my family and I can begin the process of healing. And Mason, starting tomorrow night, you and I will be sharing this anchor desk for the City View evening news. But tonight is not about us. We are here to honor someone who cannot be at this desk this evening. Carmen was a rare talent, wasn't she? Yes that's right, Lois. Carmen was larger than life. Let's have a look at some of Carmen's favorite clips. We're ready for that video now. ( Heather ): Carmen Campbell is gone, but not forgotten. She leaves behind a daughter and a sister who love and respect her. What the hell is this? Uh... Beloved anchor Mason Campbell met Sandra Conroy 15 years ago- Is this being broadcast? Ah, Jerry? This was not in the rehearsal. He interviewed Sandra after her late husband mysteriously died in a freak car accident. Soon after an adulterous affair began, which is still going on today. It spanned years, mostly in high-end hotel rooms at casino resorts. Sandra was Mason's secret addiction, along with his gambling. ( nervous chuckle ) It's Heather, I mean she's obviously struggling. It's clear that Carmen knew her killer. There was no struggle, the security alarm was turned off, but who was it? I know it wasn't me. And I know it wasn't her daughter, Brooke. And I also know that it wasn't her husband, Mason. He may have thought it up but he would never have the guts to commit murder. So who poisoned and killed Carmen? Her lawyer, Sandra Conroy, went over to her house the day she died and brought with her a bottle of wine laced with Xanax- Is this really happening? That Mason supplied from the old prescription. Shut her up, now! Mason, get them to stop this! It's feeding directly to the satellite uplink. There's nothing we can do from here. I think I know where she is. The two conspired to stall Carmen from changing her will until they could kill her. For Mason, his primary motive was money so he could pay off his gambling debts. But for Sandra it was much more. She wanted Mason all to herself and my sister was standing in the way. They almost committed the perfect murder, but they forgot one thing. There's more than one good journalist in the family. There she is. This is Heather Pearson reporting for Carmen Campbell. Come on, work! Grab the cameras, let's go! Michael! Come on, Michael, let's go! Check the studio in the west wing. You annoying little bitch. It's over, Sandra. She's right, Sandra. No, it's her word against ours and she'll never have her day in court. It's self defense Mason, and you are my witness. Get her! ( Struggling grunts ) ( Struggling grunts ) Let go of me!!! I'm in the south wing, studio B. ( Fighting grunts ) Get of me!! I need a key card! No! Freeze! Drop it! I was defending myself. Mason, tell her. Tell her! I said drop it. Mason, tell her. Cuff 'em. Mason? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. Mason? A comment? You did good. Heather, can we have a sound byte? Bite me. Wait, you weren't rolling on that? Heather's been through enough. But it's ratings gold! Well, hello Miss Pearson. We have refreshments waiting for you and twenty minutes 'till we go. Good evening, California, and welcome to the Pearson Report. I'm so proud to announce that I have a really special guest on tonight. He's a dear friend and a local hero. A man who has dedicated his life to those who are suffering from the pains of addiction. Seth, thank you so much for being here. Oh, it's- it's my pleasure. Thank you so much for having me. I love your brooch, by the way. Oh, thank you. It looks great. You have a nice shirt on. I wasn't sure what to wear. I'm new to this whole thing. Well, you're gonna be fine. Alright. So um, let's just dive right in. How did you get started in this line of work? Yeah, you know, it's something I struggled with, addiction, when I was in my younger years, I was fortunate, because I had a mentor a couch actually, a basketball couch, who sort of pulled me aside and steered me in the right direction. And it changed my life and from that moment forward I realized I wanted to give something back.
