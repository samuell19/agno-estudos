The scorching sun overhead, the red track underfoot. You chase the wind and race with the clouds. From your sweat, we can see the spirit of self-challenge and never giving up. Today, we've ushered in the Spring Sports Meeting of Duanfen Primary School. Your turn now. Hurry up. On behalf of all the athletes, I feel very excited. At this moment, I believe you feel just as excited as I do. In the course of one climax after another, the students demonstrated excellent sportsmanship. Sports represents strength. Sports embodies willpower. I hope all you athletes will do your best, demonstrate your strength with confidence and let the arc turns into a windy danced golden light Is she alright? Yu Meiren? How did this happen? Move. 50 meters? 50 meters! First place in the softball game. Li Shiquan, Class 5, Grade 5. He refreshed the school record for a second time. Hurry. The injured is in Room 303. This way, hurry up. Room 303. - Find a good spot. - Get the exclusive news this time. Move, keep up. - Give me some space. - Just say something, anything. So many casualties. Was it a Jerry-built project? - Say something. - Anything. It's 1 o'clock. Call security. What's up? Visiting hours are over. Leave. No more filming. Leave the hospital now. It's 1 o'clock now. Time to leave. - Leave. - Don't push me! The authorities have determined the cause of the accident as a standards violation of the construction party. It's becoming sensational and you're the only survivor of the construction party on set I'm afraid you'll be the scapegoat. A nationwide audience will watch through my camera. As long as you're innocent, we'll help you get the justice. We still have two minutes. Think about it. At the time of construction, we knew that a lot of the materials had problems. The thickness of the rebar was not up to the standard. The concrete was also mixed with impurities. But the suppliers were all designated by Party A. We're just workers. What is a qualified journalist? Should be just like her, with unique perspective and special tactics Yu, you seem to be omnipotence. I am flattered. Xiaoxiao, what about yours? Come in. Chief, you asked for me? Yu, your working enthusiasm all designated by Party A. I haven't been slacking about the preparations for New York because of the matters at hand. My English level has returned to how it was in my schooldays. In an absolute climax Excellent Well, I actually asked you here to discuss matters about sending you to New York. Sure. Take a deep breath. Yes, relax. Now try to imagine the university you desired to go Wow, why is so bright? Don't let your faith be affected by the trivial matters happening now. Hey beauty, your boobs are not as same as your image Your image is fake How can I believe your words? You like this one, huh? You jerk. Aha, dressing up? Well, Venus enters Capricorn, your Seventh House. Ever met your Mr. Right? Listen, Yu Meiren, you always use the attitude of being a journalist to find a man How could you find the right one? Wrong! I'm using the attitude of finding Mr. Right to be a journalist. If you can't find your Mr. Right, never tell anyone you have an Astrologer Consultant. Besides, Mars is going to be retrograde in Capricorn, which goes against your Lagnadhipati. Coupled with this impediment and with no lucky star to rescue you, all in all, you're about to enter the worst month of your life. If I were you, I'd take a break, go home right away and go nowhere You'll be so dead if you go on any trip now. Is it really that serious? I'm not kidding this time. Bloody disaster. Look, this bell in many crisis saved countless people When the bell rings, Flee Understand? Please. Watch out for traffic when crossing the street. If going downstairs... Well, I... I've just received an application asking for a reporter to the Journalist Station in Shitou Town. But it's been decided that I'll be sent to New York, right? The station will send Wang Xiaoxiao instead. There's nothing I can do. Wang Xiaoxiao's family has a lot of resources of the political and business communities in New York. She might be able to get interviews with many big shots. Our station highly values it. So family background rules? I know your plans. You originally thought you'd use the opportunity of going to New York make a pilot to earn the host of the new show through the coming competition Correct? Yu, if you don't want to go to Shitou Town, we won't force you. Beauty Yu, as the saying goes, 'All roads lead to Rome.' But some people were born in Rome. Rumor says you want to compete with me for our station's new show. Well, you may go ahead and try. Sometimes, if you don't try, you'll never know the taste of desperate. I'll take it. The bus is broken. Please get off. - Broken? - Get down and walk straight It's not that far. - So stinky. - What a smell! Hey, may I help? How come you look so familiar to me? In which year were you born? People in the city don't do this even decade ago. So people in the city like to talk to the back of head? So alike! Are you... Yes. I'm the reporter on TV. No. Beauty, which primary school did you go to? Nice bean curd jelly. My cards suck! So stinky. For the Black Widow, I personally will take the fourth layer because a Black Widow - need enough black. - Just drop the delivery at the doorway. Am I right? But don't make it too black at night, or it will attract something evil... Zombie! Where's my wand? Listen, I don't care which graveyard you climbed out of. No money but my life only! I'm Yu Meiren. Sounds familiar. Your new leader. A small situation happened on the way here. Oh, Ms. Yu? Hello. Thanks for the trouble. What is that smell? So stinky. Let me introduce myself again. My name is Yu Meiren. From today, we'll be a team. Our Shitou Town has long been yearning for a professional media person like you. You're not only our leader but our example as well. Da, if I'm not wrong, you wrote the application because we missed one person for 'Fight the Landlord'? Stop the bullshit. Ms. Yu, do you know how to play 'Fight the Landlord'? Are you any different from me? You dare to hit me? How dare you! As a team, the most important thing is not to denigrate each other. OK, let's sort it out and check if there's any news we can make. Hello Mom. Honey, you said you'd come over to my office, and you have a surprise for me? Have you been appointed as the host of the new show? The pilot is not on wheel yet. Look, forget about any surprises. You must not relax in your work. Listen to me. A woman must have her own career. Otherwise, you can't get a foothold in society. Look at your Dad. He's been a small potato all his life, and he's good for nothing in the end. Mom... OK, do your best. Mom will wait for your good news. Ms. Yu, you've come just at the right time. Tomorrow is the annual Dragon Boat Race. This is a big news. Our show begins. "Media area" And there's food? Wow peanuts. Let's go. Let's play 'Fight the Landlord'! What are you doing Ms.Yu? I haven't finished eating yet. - Da, my cell phone. - Oh. I'm afraid your feet won't be in the frame. It's the professional state that counts. Why is it black? You're watching the annual Dragon Boat Race in Shitou Town. You can see behind me that the contestants are boarding one by one. Their appearance is also being warmly welcomed by the people in the town. I believe we'll see a very fierce race. Let's find out. We can't shoot the finish line here. Be quick, Grandpa. Be quick. Keep up. I'm trying. Hurry. This is the fastest I can go. Girl, the boat's flooded. What did you say? Hurry and speed up. The boat's flooded. It's broken. Jump! Someone's fallen in the water. - Hold on. - Stop it! Is she alright? Wake up Ms. Yu, are you alright? Yu Meiren! Is she alright? First place in the Dragon Boat Race goes to the Shiquan Farm Team. First place in the softball game goes to Li Shiquan of Class 5, Grade 5. Li Shiquan, please come up and accept your prize. Da, come over. Let's go and see the champions. How about Ms. Yu? Don't worry. She'll be awake in a moment. Li Shiquan. Third place, Li Shiquan. I've made a divination for you. Li Shiquan in the class next door is the curse of your life. Remember this and never ever get close to him. "Tomorrow will be brighter." Li Shiquan, Class 5, Grade 5. Third place, Li Shiquan. Li Shiquan, Class 5, Grade 5. Li Shiquan is the curse of your life. Li Shiquan? Hey, watch out. Li Shiquan? Your curse? It can't be! It's true. No wonder I've been so unlucky lately. You know what? Each time the bell rings, he's around. Unbelievable! It's been more than ten years, but you two still run into each other. You're cursed to be together for all eternities. Huh, thank you! All eternities! I only hope he won't make trouble for me in this life. Captain, Yu Meiren? Is it really you? Hello. No way. He lives just across from me... This is the retrograde effect of Mars. Now get packed and go home. Forget about the show. Keep hiding for half a month. If not, I'm warning you you'll be so dead. From childhood to adulthood, every time Li Shiquan comes around, something bad happens to me. This so-called 'curse' must be hidden with a certain kind of trigger. 50 meters! "Rangefinder" Given all the past cases, every bad thing happened, Li Shiquan and I were within 50 meters. Therefore, his field of curse fails beyond 50 meters. News must rely on facts, the most important ethics for a journalist is not to make up anything but to be objective. Now, let's talk about sensitivity. Da, what is sensitivity? Sensitivity is... Momo, what do you think? Self-study. Chief? Yu, Let's make it fair. Here's a chance to beat Wang Xiaoxiao Nowadays, organic agriculture and food safety are hot topics. I've learned that the only two Michelin 3-star restaurants in our country purchase ingredients surprisingly from the same farm, known as 'Shiquan Farm'. Shiquan Farm? Are you sure? Positive. It's right in your place. You're really lucky. Here we are, boss. Da, Look where'd you park! Watch out. Da, come and film here. Give me a wide shot. Boss, your life savior! Ah, no killing! What are you doing? What are YOU doing? Da, help me. What the hell are you doing? Rangefinder!? Listen, if you take me as your boss, keep this man 50 meters away from me. Do you need any help? Move. - Don't come over. - Stop! Don't get too close. Don't blame me for not reminding you. Boss, but we still need to interview him, right? According to the Internet, his grandfather is the real owner of the farm. What else does the Internet say? The Internet also says his grandfather never accepts any interviews. Well... So muddy! Is senior Li here? We want to interview him. We are from Sun TV. Who's there? Senior Li, we're from the TV station. We want to interview you. Interview? Hum, again. Boss, we'd better go before... Don't be afraid. We've done nothing wrong. We are really sincere. - Da... - Boss... Da... My mic... Leave it to me. Boss, I just realize journalism is a high-risk career. The more they're against us, the more valuable the news is. I'll get the news no matter what. We're jour-journalists. We want... Please no. Help! Help! Please... Run. This is candid footage. We can see the conditions of the pigsty here and its general appearance. Hey! - What are you doing? - Leave! It's less than 50 meters for sure! Run! This way. Let's go. What? Can you stop poking me, Da? That sounds so erotic. Boss, Da keeps poking me. No. Someone's pushing me. Nonsense. - You're the last one. - Right. Ouch! Run! Turn! Turn! Reporter Yu, our cattle got rut because of you guys. What shall we do now? Stop poking! Stop it. Li Shiquan! Da, wait for me. Yu, I understand the situation, but you can't just give up. Now everyone claims they practice organic agriculture, but are they all telling the truth? If we can expose their lies, it'll be very promising for the selection of for the new show. Got it. I'm the news conqueror. We can't be nice to people who don't understand the land. What's wrong? The lead journalist is a former classmate of mine. No wonder you can't even tighten a screw today. It's nothing like that. Look, it's done. I discovered some unidentified liquid in Shiquan Farm's warehouse. Could it be the legendary chemical fertilizer they use? Up to now, we're not absolutely certain about it. But I think we're getting close to the core secret of Shiquan Farm... Welcome back to the Weekly Horoscope. Let's see. In the coming week, what will happen to the horoscope and which constellations will be affected? Mars will be retrograde in Capricorn for two and a half months. During this time, Mars will be impeded by another malefic planet, Saturn. This can be said to add fuel to the flames, portending one disaster after another. Hello? It's Li Shiquan. What the hell do you want? Haven't you done enough? Yesterday, someone deliberately destroyed the feed transmission device on the farm. I'm watching the monitoring video. What do you want? Just one question. Do you really want to interview Shiquan Farm? Of course I do. Do you think I'll give up over this small difficulty? Let me tell you, as long as it's the news I want, - I'll be sure to... - Fine. 3:00 pm. The small garden by the farm. Be there or be square. - A special reminder for Capricorn - What the... to be very careful. Be cautious! Take care! Don't go out unless you have to. Just stay at home. For me? I'm Li Shiquan. Where are you? Behind you. Enough of the measuring? Let's go. Li Shiquan, you agreed to take me to your grandpa, but this is not the way to his farm. Who told you I'd take you to him? You did. You agreed to take me to your grandpa, so I came Well yes. But not now. What are we doing now? Planting vegetables. Planting vegetables? What do you mean? My grandpa refused your interview for just one reason. You don't understand the language of plants. The language of plants? I'll leave the rest to you. Hey, Li Shiquan, you really want me to plant these vegetables? Hey, Li Shiquan, can you hear me? Why have all my vegetable died? 50 meters south, I've prepared new seedlings for you. Redo it. How did you know my seedlings would die? Did you play a dirty trick in secret? Li Shiquan? "How to care for vegetable seedlings" "Watering tips" Hold still. Keep your hands steady. Good, good. Look for a new composition. It's raining. Will they be very cold? Where did they swim to? I asked you to shoot the pigs. Thanks for the gold coins. "How to fertilize" Yeah! I made it. You don't have to measure. I'm just passing by. Bye. Lovely! Ah! Li Shiquan, there's a leech in your field. Now it's on my leg! Captain, don't rip it off Or it'll worm deeper into your flesh. Let it loosen its bite on its own. I haven't ripped it off but it isn't loosening its bite. Are there any other ways? Come over and help! Oh no. Don't come over. Just tell me. Don't come over. You asked me to come over then asked me to stay away. How can I help you? I know what to do now. What are you doing? Be quick. What took you so long? Mind your head. Pour it now. It let go! It really let go! Thank you. My pleasure. You can keep it. Captain, kindly warn you, it can't be taken orally. Li Shiquan! Hello, what now? Master, is there any way to break the 50-meter curse? Yes! This spell is in this iron box. You can open and use it only once. Can I trust you? Only once? Once is not enough? How many is enough? Enough to be in love? Hey, you blushed! My God! Can't believe there's a man really attracting you! Work. It's for work. I've checked it on the Internet. They say, to overcome the curse, just wear Nike (resistant to curse). That's totally unreliable. Bullshit! Isn't it? You don't believe it either. I quit. You're just fooling me. Planting vegetables! Fooling me around. Hello, do you know that when we first grew organic vegetables, we had the same problems. After a decade or more of trying, Grandpa achieved pure organic cultivation. I've reaserched. The crops need the three main elements of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to grow. But without artificial fertilizer, the three elements can't reach a balance at all. You led me to plant vegetables step by step just to tell me that pure organic cultivation is impossible. Your Shiquan Farm is also using artificial fertilizer as an additive. Am I right? You've proven to be a well-trained reporter, always thinking negatively about everything. You still refuse to admit it now, huh? It's been so long yet you still can't communicate with the plants. OK then. Tonight, I'll take you to uncover the secret of Shiquan Farm. How about that? Li Shiquan? Open the balcony door first. The curse's clay pot rice. Dare to have a taste? Why not? How does it taste? Just so so. All the ingredients in this rice come from Shiquan Farm. Do you have a better impression of us now? Will I be poisoned and die? No. That's what happens if you eat instant noodles every day. You're spying on me? Me? No. It was the store owner. She said you bought all the instant noodles in stock. I'm done eating. It's time to tell me the secret of Shiquan Farm. Come with me. Here we are. Are you still there? Go on your way. Keep your distance from me. I'm turning left, you may turn right. You've come to the farm many times, but all you care about are your suspicions. Never paid attention to what's under your feet. How come the vegetable grow so well here? Want to know the secret of our farm? Put your hand into the soil. Come. Boss... Boss's new invention. Please let us go... What have I been doing recently? Farming, right? But the vegetables I planted either had pests or died. A total failure. Have you ever thought about why the plants in Shiquan Farm grow so well? No fertilizer nor pests. Why? Last night I put my hand very deep in the soil. Guess what I felt? Pesticides! Warmth! Warmth? Four hours after the sunset, the soil was still warm. Why? The soil is alive. It's still warm even under 10 cm of the soil. It means there are many thriving microorganisms. Feel it for yourselves. Its a kind of bacteria in the soil that captures nitrogen from the air and turns it into nutrients. Amazing soil... So the reason why we were driven out is because our flat shoes destroyed this organic soil! You got the point! So I've made these shoes. They won't harm the soil and can even help it to breathe. Perfect. Is Grandpa Li in? Boss, are you sure Li Shiquan didn't trick you last night? Calm down. Your shoes look funny but useless. However, I can see your sincerity. Welcome. Shiquan Farm welcomes anyone who respects the land. Thank you, Grandpa. Thank you, Grandpa Li. Say hello to Grandpa Li. - Thank you, Grandpa. - Welcome. Thank you, Grandpa We're here to learn. You are all handsome! Be careful. Look. Look at that chicken. It has a camera. What you see right now is the legend of the agricultural industry, Shiquan Farm. This is the first time in 18 years that the farm has given a media interview. The only two Michelin 3-star restaurants in our country both purchase ingredients from this farm. According to the farm's owner, Mr. Li, the soil here has probiotics that have developed for many years. They not only automatically maintain the ecological balance, but protect the crops from pests. I shot this myself! For more secrets of Shiquan Farm, please watch our follow-up reports. Remember, use it only once. Take it. No need to thank me. Come back alive. My ice cream! Congratulations, Captain. Captain, do you have mixed feelings about your curse now? Love and hate at the same time? Am I so easily bought? But I have to say, you have a good mastery of cooking. I've been cooking since boyhood, you know? Are you sure you practiced cooking rather than eating as a boy? Tell you the truth, my parents ran a restaurant. They were short of staff, so I had to go and help in the kitchen every day after school. From chopping to serving, I was good at everything. Chef, what's that thing behind you? You really want to know? This is the place where I usually work. Welcome for your visit and guidance, Captain! Li Shiquan, who the hell are you? Reporter Yu, are you interviewing me? Isn't this New York? Your family's restaurant is in New York? It can't be true! This is the world's best architecture school. Li Shiquan, be honest with me. Why are you pretending to be a farmer here? So an architect can't be a farmer? Well then, when can I see your work, Architect Li? Not yet. Because I will design a perfect architecture. You know, I've interviewed many artists. They all say they pursue perfection but it's just an excuse. The pursuit of perfection is the process, not the result. Fine. When you've actually built something, I'll admire you then. Duanfen Primary School Spring Sports Meeting. First place in the softball game. Result: 50 meters. Wow, you still keep this? Of course. It has great commemorative significance. Commemorating what? My first bad luck because of you? To commemorate the first time when you noticed me. Otherwise... how could a captain remember a nobody like me? What are you smiling for...? Is there anything else to show me around? The stars here are so beautiful. You've been here for quite long but never take a good look at the stars here yet? Nope. I rarely feel so relaxed. It would be nice to see the stars like this at home every day in the future. But every now and then, I hear this voice: 'You know, When you have a rest, all the others are sparing no efforts, all the others are becoming better. Can you catch up with them?' Call this voice out. I want to talk to it. Talk about what? I will say, 'Let go of Yu Meiren. "She's very tired."' "Once there was a captain," "she strived to be the first for certain." "She set us a good example." "She was the future pillar of the Motherland." "In places where no one can see," "the captain silently weeps." "In an endless race," "she forces herself to be strong." "Oh, my Captain," "she finds no time to see the stars." "Oh, my Captain," "she was envied by us all." "Even if you've got 59 points," "someone still silently..." Disgusting. It's swollen. How did the bug bite on the butt? OK now. You may get up. Don't get wet. Thank you. "Li Shiquan" Hello, Chief Wang. Yu, I watched your report. I thought it was the agricultural channel. There will be more follow-up report coming. But I really haven't uncovered anything... Wang Xiaoxiao is interviewing a senator in the US. If you can't come up with anything big, how can you compete? I haven't seen him engage in his own interests for a long time. He's sacrificed a lot to help me with the farm... Li Shiquan, are you busy? What is it? Tell me, in Shitou Town, is there any other big news? A weird guy and girl has to be 50 meters apart. How about that? Li Shiquan, if I... Wait a minute I have an incoming call. Hello Mom. Look at you. Instead of going to New York, you went to such a small place. Why didn't you tell me? How are you doing? Are you getting used to the place? Mom, you sound different. Anything wrong? Nothing serious. Mom had a minor surgery couple days ago. Why didn't you tell me? How do you feel now? Don't worry. Your Dad's with me. You... you two stopped arguing? Well, Been there, done that. What else? I always wanted to ask you. If you looked down on Dad, why did you give up the chance to college but marry him? I was just too simple. I thought if I missed him, I'd never find anyone who cared about me as much as he did. But unexpectedly, aside from being nice to me, he has no other merits. Well, forget about him. Tell me about your work. How are you getting on? Mom, if I fail to win the new show will you think I'm a loser? Honey, no matter what you do, ask your heart. Mom, hold on. I'll call you back in a minute. Li Shiquan? What's up? Is it power failure? Don't worry. I'll come and fix it for you. Wait! Wait till I leave the building. You win. Crazy. The circuit board might be struck by lightning. I'll take a look. You be careful. Hello. Boss, the heavy rain caused a landslide leading to a power outage over a large area. You were looking for other big news just now, right? We're very close to the scene here. Boss, exclusive! You and Momo go and shoot right away. What about you? Li Shiquan. Li Shiquan, do me a favor. Boss! Da, show me. No. Nothing can be shot from here. No, it's too dangerous. But it's important to me. Then I'll go with you. We're journalists and we have press cards. Roll camera. From last night till now, the rainfall has exceeded 110 mm. As you can see, due to this rare torrential rain, a great landslide has occurred on the mountain of Shitou Town. I'm now in the severely stricken area. And beneath this area Beneath is the State Grid equipment that has just been damaged. It has led to a power outage over a large area of the city. As for the casualties and relief situations, we will follow up and report further. Watch out! Yu Meiren, were you hurt? Don't be afraid. Don't look down. Hold on. I'll come and help you! Don't come over, Li Shiquan. It's OK. I'll be fine! Stay away! Please! Each time we're together, something bad happens. Now you are in danger too If we survive, we'd better not seeing each other any more Job orientation No.1: safety first! Well then. Go back and rest for couple days. Be prepare for the competition of the new show next week. What's up? Beauty Yu, I heard that you became the news instead of reporting it? It seems that barbarous place is really more splendid than New York! Remember to come for the competition next week. We're all looking forward to seeing your non-mainstream rural show. Look, isn't she the one? It's really her! I would like a photo with her! Payment Come and look. Clay pot, bowls and chopsticks. Sit down. Let me introduce. This is the boyfriend I met when you weren't around. Fang Jie, Scorpio. Our stars are very complementary to each other this month. A perfect match, right? I brought him here to ward off evil for you. Hello. Please have a taste. My first time. My goodness! Great Reporter Yu, when did you become so virtuous? Help him. Help yourself. - Make yourself at home. - OK. Smells so good. This is delicious! It's terrible. Not at all. It's really good! Say it! Yes, it's good! That's because you haven't eaten the best clay pot rice. Excuse me. Yu Meiren, Do you know what I admire you the most? That is no matter when you always clear about what you want and fight for it with great determination. Super cool. I mean it. At every such moment, you are shining all over to me But now I really don't know what I want. I don't know! Your show of course! Could it be your curse Li Shiquan?! Men flow like water. Flowing away anyway. Jupiter is about to enter Capricorn, which is your House of Life. Good luck is coming soon. Fight for your show. Fight for my show! Good. The invincible Reporter Yu is back. You're watching the annual Dragon Boat Race in Shitou Town. A sudden rain has dispelled the summer heat after many days. It also makes us feel... Fans, this is my new leader. Momo, stop playing with your cell phone. It's raining. Will they be very cold? Where did they swim to? Momo, answer me. When we worked, were you Live webcasting yourself or us? Boss. I'm sorry. I'm just trying in the beginning But you got way too popular for doing silly things... Me? Popular? Zombie! Where's my wand? Today I'll show you how my boss plants vegetables. I'm sure something even crazier will happen soon. Just wait and see. Just as I expected! Wow, so many gifts! Stop it. Let's go. Hold on. Our new leader was saved by a handsome man risking his own life. But nothing romantic could ever happen to someone like her... The webcasting of reporting news is much more fun than the news itself. Hey, what are you doing? It's less than 50 meters for sure! Please don't go. Listen, we don't match. No! We're meant for each other. No... Cheng Fang, you've been lying here all night? Love sucks!

Since Sun TV established, this is the first fair and open campaign of a new show. I announce the official start of the campaign. This dome-shaped house built from recycled materials takes vertical pine boards arranged in a ring as the center of the building. The marvelous part is you can see the stars from every corner of the house. In the history of the EKC International Architectural Design Competition, this is the first time a Chinese contestant has won the laurel. The International Jury Committee highly commends this work as follows: 'It's really a breakthrough in form.' 'I just want to say congratulations and really thank you.' Where does your creative inspiration come from? From a friend who never gives up easily. Wow, is it a girl? Do you have anything to say to her? Well... Yu Meiren, are you watching now? I need to tell you something. Please come to the playground of our primary school. I'll be there. Let's present the first candidate, Gan Lin. Today I'm introducing a high end talk show named Pathfinder. Just as the name implies, this is a forward-looking show. Our vision spans the entire country. We'll explore the current industrial situations in depth with the most professional point of view and guests from different fields in China. The number you dialed is powered off. Just imagine, a Type 99 Main Battle Tank smashes straight into the studio. Interesting, yes? My Military World show... You can't go inside. I have to. Let me in. Go away. Yu Meiren! Yu Meiren! I need to see her. Excuse me. My friend. Why are you here? Li Shiquan in the news said he built a star-view house. Seriously? He also said on TV that he'd be waiting for you at the school playground right now. Don't miss this chance. You mean now? Yes, right now! But I... Li Shiquan is your true love. What else could be more romantic than two people being unlucky together? Next, Wang Xiaoxiao will make her presentation. Fine! Let fate decide. Head or tail? You know what you want now? Go in my place. Our Sun TV has a keen nose for the scent of news... ...a program with authoritative information and refined production focusing on American society... Li Shiquan He built a star-view house. When can I see your work, Architect Li? Not yet. Because I will design a perfect architecture. It would be nice to see the stars like this at home every day in the future. OK. "Life is full of ups" "and downs." "Like a vast sea with no end." "I want to chase the wind" "and go far." "As I'd hate to be nobody for life." "Hustle and bustle," "back and forth," "That's not what I desire." "I'll be brave" "for you," "to be the man with teen spirit and gut." "There is no turning back." "We waved goodbye without a word." "Then the curtain" "fell in silence." "No one can own everything." "I was so lost." "I even lost myself." "Let me daydream for you" "one more time." Thanks for the wonderful speech of Wang Xiaoxiao. Now let's present the last candidate, Yu Meiren. What happened? I saw her in the last row just now. Where is she? We've been waiting so long. Look at her. What is she wearing? It's not Yu Meiren. Xiaoxiao is sure to win. That's crazy. What... What's the matter? It's not Yu. I'm a friend of Yu Meiren. I'm a famous web astrologer. I've come in her place... The heroine of Live Webcast "Love in 50 Meters" finally shows up. The news is finally aired! I've been waited for you for so long! Hold tight. Don't be a chicken. I'm not. Let's begin! News is more than a result, it is a process. Security! Who's this? What's this? Dear fans, are you excited? What's all this mess? I'm so thrilled. Turn it off Isn't this Live webcasting? Hold on. How many viewers? More than 8 million. More than 8 million? It's on. It's on. Come over. Just like Li Shiquan, you also unwittingly fell in love with her? Isn't that Yu? Why think so much? Just be together. Why isn't she here for her presentation? Well, let me explain. Yu Meiren's show means to fully integrate the traditional TV media field with the current popular concept of live interaction. Therefore, she must be present on the scene for her show to showcase for you the possibility of interaction between media. We're back to this place now. I'd like to tell you my story of 50 meters. Once upon a time, there was Little Fatty. He had a secret crush on their primary school captain. But Little Fatty found that the captain had too many concerns. So he tried everything he could to get her attention. Contrary to his expectations, the effects were not so good. So he made another attempt. "Tomorrow will be brighter." Which class are you in? Your name? Class 5, Grade 5, Li Shiquan. 16, 18, 20, 26... Third place for 'I love growing plants' goes to Li Shiquan. Oops. Things became worse and worse. Little Fatty became a 'curse'. 18 years later, Little Fatty and the captain met again. However, they were still bound by the curse of 50 meters. Every time I stood 50 meters away and looked at you from afar, I kept asking myself the same question. Li Shiquan, why can't you move one step forward? Are you satisfied with what we just presented? Ms. Yu? Show it to me! Now! Actually I'm full of doubts about myself. I wasn't sure if I was good at design or not. When the girl I like appeared again, I was not sure what I could do to make her like me. I was afraid she'd turn me down. So I just kept this distance away from her. But you made me believe that we must have the guts to fight for everything. So today, I will walk to you step by step to tell you that I love you! Say something. Boss, he's already confessed. Why just stand there? Gosh! We all are waiting! Say something! Li Shiquan, did you ever doubt that I might not be the perfect captain in your imagination? You said I've been working very hard. Because I was very scared. I was afraid to disappoint people. I was afraid to let people see me not good enough, not excellent enough. In fact, it wasn't the 50 meters that I was afraid of. I was afraid... afraid to expose my imperfect self in front of the one I love. You will be disappointed. Hey, stop! Why stopped? Susan, how to contact with the webcasting hostess? I know! Young comrade, so be it. Our campaign today is over. Thank you. Ferraris! So many! What's this? Boss, a fan named 'Mom' has flooded the screen with 40 Ferraris for you! Keep going It costs several hundred thousand. Several hundred thousand? This fan named 'Mom' also said, 'This man is awesome and much better than your Dad!' I'm running out of money. I'll top up. What are they doing? They're sending gifts for encouragement. Then you help us send some as well. I'll... try... Do you remember the song I sing for you that night? The last lyric goes like this 'Even if you got 59 points, someone still loves you.' So even I wasn't good enough, you still like me, right? Absolutely. Come on. Come on! Yeah! This is the power of love. Yeah! Fans, I really think you're super smart. So, based on your suggestions, we've decided to modify the rangefinder. Now let's see the great... whatever. Take a look... Da, how is the modification? Perfect! Now, even they're cheek to cheek, it will be over 50 meters anyway. Marvelous! Isn't he...? Wow, a love affair. Let's go and find out! - Hold on. - Stop. What? The curse and life savior of our boss, why are you spying on her? We've got you. - Now confess! - What are you doing here? You've got a crush on our boss? No. Now answer me. What's the relationship between you two? Now confess! We're... Look, our boss's eyes are full of love. I'm sure our boss is fond of him. After testing, we found that Brother Shiquan's remote control was not as good as he claimed. It sucks in strong wind. But don't worry. The cute me invented a fishing line that leads to the great love! I invented it! Shut up! I did. Hey, when can you finish the house? Come on, stop shooting me. I'm not a star. Just tell us. We all want to know. Well, Send me gifts! They are doing that! Really?!
