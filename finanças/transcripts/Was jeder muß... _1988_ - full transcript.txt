Final Basic Studies Project 1987-88 If you had one wish, what would it be? To go home. To go home. Bye. It's hard when Dieter is away. Everything from fetching the coal to being alone at night. Are you alright with him being there? I always knew he would have to go away to the army. Sooner or later. Why did he have to join the army? Everyone has to. Why? Well ... What Every Man Must Do... One, two, three Company: lights out! Step two. Step four. Step one. Step two. Step three. Step four. Step one. Step two. Step three. Step four. From the initial position, lying one meter from the practice dummy. One! Take your original position. Comrades, we are training for the last time. If it goes well, then there'll be no more training for you. Work hard, focus on taking the oath as well as on marching, and it'll run smoothly today. Troops in formation, come to attention! Good afternoon soldiers, sergeants, ensigns and officers. GOOD AFTERNOON COMRADE LIEUTENANT COLONEL! More in unison, just like I ordered, repeat what I say. Good afternoon soldiers, sergeants, ensigns and officers. GOOD AFTERNOON COMRADE LIEUTENANT COLONEL! Even more in unison! Good afternoon soldiers, sergeants, ensigns and officers. GOOD AFTERNOON COMRADE LIEUTENANT COLONEL! Eyes to the... ...front! I have asked two of your officers if they would rather send you guys home. How do you think they answered? They'd prefer to keep us here, I assume. Both of them said they would prefer to send you home immediately. Maybe they said that, but they're thinking something else. They said they think they would be happy to do away with the army. Then they'd be unemployed and couldn't tell anybody what to do. No, they couldn't do that. They depend on it. -You don't believe it? -I don't. Do you trust your superiors? No. Not much. A few maybe. -There are a few. -Sure. I swear I SWEAR A little louder. alongside the Soviet Army ALONGSIDE THE SOVIET ARMY and the armies of our socialist allies AND THE ARMIES OF OUR SOCIALIST ALLIES Louder. as a soldier of the National People's Army AS A SOLDIER OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S ARMY to always be prepared TO ALWAYS BE PREPARED to defend socialism against all enemies TO DEFEND SOCIALISM AGAINST ALL ENEMIES Louder. You keep getting quieter. and to stake my life in the name of victory. AND TO STAKE MY LIFE IN THE NAME OF VICTORY. We'll call it a success. Rifles...up! Soldiers, I congratulate you on your adjuration. HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH! More uniformly and clearly. Soldiers, I congratulate you on your adjuration. HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH! Face left! Soldiers, repeat the oath after me. I swear I SWEAR Do you ever talk about politics, like the meeting with Gorbachev, for example? Rarely. When we're here we clean up and then go to bed. We don't feel like doing anything else. Have you heard, read or thought about the treaty? Sure, I've heard about it. Do you think that if nuclear weapons were now abolished, you would be discharged earlier? No way. Later, rather. Why later? If they didn't have nuclear weapons they'd have to increase the size of the army. If they had one fewer armament, they would need to compensate. So you think there could be another war? Yes, exactly. That's what I think. Do you think there's no chance that the army would simply vanish one day? -No. I don't believe so. -Why? The danger is too great that the Americans or someone else will attack us. I don't think that will happen. At least in my opinion. One last time. Lying in the initial position. CHRISTMAS PARTY It's not something I'm used to, but... ...I think it's very nice that you walked together. But I'm the duck! We are but a small country compared to our neighbors. But even if we were a large one! Tradition? Great in traditions and in spirit! But on the map, we are, and will remain, a small country. Hear, hear! We all know the problem. Your son resists your efforts to find a suitable wife for him. This generation has no respect! Merry Christmas, Simone. Tonight we'll be with Dieter. If you have something to say, we can play it back for him. OK. Stevie came home from the hospital today for good. -He is here. -Yes, he is sitting right here. He is sitting on my lap. He has grown. Now he is 65 cm long. He has a new little teddy bear. I hope you won't be too drunk after the big Christmas party. They are bringing you a present. I hope you like it. I got you something to paint. You'll be picked up on New Years Eve by your brother and I. What should I say? -Whatever you want. -Whatever I want? Oh, don't rip open your Christmas present. Unwrap it carefully. Stevie is laughing right now. He knows what I wrapped. And he sends you his greetings. You should come home soon. One last question. If you were an army general, what is the first thing you would change about the army? -I have to think about that. -Think about it. Definitely change the location where people are stationed. So they are closer to home and can take more leave. That would be the thing I'd change if I could. That's what I would definitely change. You wouldn't do away with it? It wouldn't work anyway. I would try to, sure. -It wouldn't work? -That's not very realistic. But it wouldn't be bad. Comrades, Christmas Eve is upon us and we're spending it here. Our FDJ leaders have taken great care to make you as comfortable as possible on this most pleasant evening. Celebrating Christmas in the barracks is always difficult. It doesn't make us happy. We want to try to prevent the mood from becoming too dreary even though we cannot be with our loved ones at home. But look at it this way: our families are celebrating this Christmas in peace. To ensure that they can celebrate next year and the next is why we are celebrating Christmas here in service. We are sitting here in uniform not as an end in itself but with good reason. This duty was fulfilled by many soldiers before us. They accepted the duty and fulfilled it. We will be rewarded for this since we can all be at home for New Years Eve. This wasn't always the case. Only since last year. From my viewpoint, this shows that our work is greatly valued. With this in mind, I wish us all a merry Christmas and a lovely celebration. -Want to have a cold buffet? -Sure.
