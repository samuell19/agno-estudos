Syria has gained the upper hand in the two-year-old Gulf Wars between itself, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. US Intelligence reports confirm that a nuclear weapons center outside Damascus, Syria... ...is days away from becoming completely operational. An experimental computer chip, developed by the Syrian military, has kept the United States out of the war to this point. The chip, when activated disables any and all enemy communications including radar, cellular, and computer-guided transmissions. The existence of this chip has made the impending nuclear threat all the more serious for the US Government. This is Robin Scott, reporting for ZNN World News. -We can’t launch our missiles. -That is correct, Mr President. As long as that signal is being transmitted, our missiles, land or fighter-based are unable to lock onto their targets, never mind arm themselves. Now we can’t send the planes in, we’ve already lost Lieutenant West going to that route. If he’s still alive, he’s being held hostage. Sir, our best guest has Syrian nuclear site very close to if not, 100 percent operational. At that current pace, they’re not going to waste time in using it. President Sayda has assured me that on no uncertain terms, they will not be using nuclear capabilities. It’s not President Sayda that worries me. There’s a multitude of forces we know nothing about that could seize control at any moment. Mr President, with all due respect, we have to strike now. Admiral Torrance. Yes, sir. Green Light Freedom Strike. Okay, the objective is to secure the transmission site and retrieve the chip. The Battle Group will be staging an air-engagement with the enemy, as a decoy to buy us time to crossover. The billion dollar technology is no bigger than this, and Washington wants it intact. The chip is located in the central mainframe. I’ll need two minutes, maybe less, to shut down the program. I can’t just rip it out because it’s already been activated. The enemy command center’s located underneath a Mausoleum in the center of a war-torn village. Now, if we can position ourselves across the way here at a high trajectory, we’ll be able to pinpoint the best mode of entry. The drop of point is 300 yards off shore, in the beautiful Mediterranean. Now that should provide us with an adequate cover. The underground entrance is secured by a standard punch code lock. We have enough fuel to last 20 minutes. So, in and out in 15. Questions? Yes, sir, fighters are being launched, they are being deployed. Yes, sir. Birds launching, sir. 063, this is Ring Leader, check in. Team Leader, this 063, Falcon is ready to play, sir. Alright, proceeding to checkpoint Zebra. Colonel, two US fighters approaching. -Redirect Squandron 17 immediately. -Yes, sir. 063, this is 064. I’m not showing anything yet. How about you? Negative, 064. I have a feeling it won’t be long though. Alright, keep looking. Here we go. Bandit, bandit. 12,000 feet bearing 05, and 40 miles. Nose is hot. Maneuvering to intercept. Roger, 064. Freedom Strike, this is Command Center. We have contact. Repeat, we have contact. Prepare for take-off. We’re going up. -What’s that? -The enemy is engaging. Move east, twelve o'clock. I think we’ve got their attention. Here they come. Looks like we’re going to have our hands full. -It’s working. -Engagement of one-one-eight-niner. Sir, we’re free and clear. -Launch the Freedom Strike helo. -Aye, aye, sir, Launch the Helo. Freedom Strike, you’re clear for take off. Here we go. They’re coming around, what do we do? Just sit tight. Let’s see how serious these guys are. Approaching insertion point. Bearing zero-four-niner, 2 miles! Suit up! We’ve reached the insertion point. Prepare to disembark. The winds are high but our hold is steady. Good luck, guys! Big Eye, this is Freedom Strike. Assault Team is deployed proceeding to Alpha Point Two. Sir, Eye in the Sky has picked them up. They’re on course for the Syrian coast line. This asshole is taking a position behind me. If he gets any closer he’d better introduce himself. Hang in there, Falcon. Don’t forget our target lock’s ineffective. I’m going to lead the one of them away. Let’s just keep them busy. Eye in the sky confirms deployment. They’re taking up positions. They’ve landed on the Syrian beach head, Sir. Go! He’s on my tail, he’s on my tail. I can’t shake him loose. -He’s going for weapons lock. -Falcon, break hard ride, now! He is still behind me. He is gonna fire, he is gonna fire! -I’ve got incoming! -Break left! Break left! That was way too close for comfort. This could get to be one expensive diversionary tactic. I’ve got this one in my sight. Switching to guns, It’s time to reach out and touch somebody. Come on, come on, get in there. Close enough. Got you! We have an aircraft down, sir. -Call in more support as soon as possible! -Yes, sir. Let’s go. Let’s go, Maddie. Geez, so much for a quiet break in, let’s go! The fighters are still in the air. Is this going to take long? Radar jamming signal has been aborted, sir. All systems are back online. Targeting systems are back. Okay, I've got enough of this bastard. I’m going after him. Here we go, I’m on his six. He’s got nowhere to go. I’m going for weapons lock. Oh, no you don’t. I got you baby, you’re mine. I got tone, I got tone. Sweet, baby, sweet! Geez, you better speed it up, Maddie. Come on. How do you know which board? Woman’s intuition? Let’s go! Get the chip out of here. I’ll watch your backs, move! Help! I’m in here! Help! Help me! Please help me! Get me out of here! Lieutenant West, you are alive. Shit! Help me, I'm in here! Are you okay, West? Shit. -I thought you were dead. -So did I. Big Eye, this is Team Leader, we've secured the skies. -No sign of enemy aircraft. -Copy, Team Leader. Maintain position and await further instructions. -Follow me, alright? -I'm ready. -Stay close. -Alright. Freedom Strike, Freedom Strike, this is ground team. -Request immediate extraction. -Roger, that. I think we can get out this way. -Freedom Strike, what’s your location? -I'm right on top of you, I’m coming down. Secure the package, I’m going back in! Tom! Gary, meet Lieutenant West. -I’ll be damned. -The pleasure is mine. -Let’s get you out of here. -I’m ready. Let’s go. I’ve got one more. No! No, stop! Let’s go, up! Big Eye, this is Freedom Strike, Bird is in hand, repeat, bird is in hand. We have one casualty, Lieutenant Nelson. Proceeding to bingo point, over. -Recall all squadrons, keep me posted. -Aye, aye sir. Send down the flight-fighters. Okay Falcon, let’s see if we can find us an aircraft carrier. Copy that. Ready in three, two, one, cue her. The two-year Arab Wars officially came to a close two weeks ago, when US Forces took control of downtown Damascus. A UN peacekeeping operation fell victim to violent anti-treaty demonstrations... ...today in Syria. The last nation to agree to the cease-fire has undergone several civil uprisings since the announcement of the agreed-upon truce. Preparations are underway for Monday’s official ending of the Arab Wars. Leaders of the four nations, along with NATO officials and President Mitchell, will be convening on board the USS Nimitz for the signing of The Arab World Peace Treaty. In other national news, Lieutenant David West... ...feared dead after his plane was shot down over Syria six weeks ago, was welcomed home in Washington today. We'll be back after these messages. Hi, you’ve reached Maddie. I’m not in right now. Leave a message and I’ll call you back. Hey Maddie, it’s me again. I was hoping you got the invite. I was also hoping you’d be home. Well... I guess I hope I see you there, too. Anyway, bye. It’s just like you to be stuffing your face. Hey, I learned from the master. Hey, muscle, muscle, man. Yeah, muscle. All muscle. How you been, man? Since… Good, good. How’s Maddie? No. Oh, Maria. What did you do now? I don’t know. Paradise just isn’t always perfect, you know. I told you this would happen. So she’s not coming? I don't know. Hey, speak of the devil! Well, you didn’t think I’d miss history in the making, did you? They’re starting to load up. Let’s go. Paradise isn’t perfect? And so it’s time that we as a nation, stop and recognize those brave but forgotten men and women who risk their lives day after day, year after year, all in the name of safety. Let me be the the first to salute you, the crossing guards of America. Good Lord. -I’m Norman Sears. -And I’m Amanda Crawford. Thanks for joining us tonight. Stay tuned for "Jerry Jacobs Live", and have a pleasant evening. Good night. Clear. Stan! Stan! Hey Amanda, really good show, -but I don’t have any time right now. -Then make time. -What is it? -Is it true? Yes, it’s true. I’ve been in love with you ever since I laid eyes on you. I’ve spoken with my wife, and she understands completely. That’s not funny, Stan. How could you give it to Norman? He leaves in an hour. Hey listen, could we talk about this later? I’ve got to put together, a competent camera crew to work with him over there, and so far it’s been a disaster. Oh, Stan, when you’re through there, I’ve got a few things to go over with you about my trip. In my office. Excellent timing as always, Norman. I’ll be right in. Hack! Sorry, I couldn’t hear you. I’ve got three Emmys stuck in my ear. How could you? That was mine from the start. I flew all over the mid-east in God knows what conditions... I didn’t get married because of it, and you give it to Norman? Amanda, you did a kick-ass job on the story. I mean it, top drawer the whole way down but Norman’s got seniority. He asked to go, I’ve got to let him go. That’s not fair, I bust my ass, he gets the payoff. He’s only going to be here a few more months, then he retires. And I’m going to need a new lead anchor. I thought I was the lead anchor. -Amanda, don’t be like that. -Get bent! This way, please. The Admiral’s waiting for you. Yes, thank you. Come in! Tom Dickson in my stateroom, and I don’t even have an autograph book. We all feel that way, sir. Well, come on in and sit down. Can I get you a cup of coffee? -No, thank you. -Thank you. How was the flight? Well, to be honest, a little bumpy. Bumpy! You’ll have to excuse my friend here, Casey, Sir. You see, being a pilot himself, he thinks he’s the only person alive... who can correctly fly an aircraft. I assure you, sir, I am not that bad. Well as the only pilot on this special ops mission, I can’t blame you for being a little cocky. Thank you. We’ve met before, very briefly as I recall. I’m sorry, sir. Madeline Reese, Admiral John Torrance. Admiral, Madeline here was SAS, British Special Forces before she got smart. Or ignorant, depending on your perspective. Well, you had the honor serving the Tom Dickson, who is one of the finest men I’ve ever served with. I have had the first-hand experience of his brilliance, sir. See, the Admiral here, he was my commander while we were on Team Six. That was before Tom was named Commander of this United States Special Ops Team. Excuse me, sir, but what’s up after the signing? Do you head back home? No, we stay to observe the disarmament process. There are a lot of folks out there who have invested a lot blood in this war, and they don’t want peace. We’re going to stay around for about three months. Sir, speaking on behalf of the whole team. I just wanted to thank you very much for the invitation. Nonsense. Aside from the medals which you all will have, the Joint Chiefs asked for you all be here. Come on, let me give you the grand tour. We’re going to have the whole thing out here. Flight deck. Flags and everything, just like the Battleship Missouri at the end of World War II. And the weather's gonna beat us up. We're gonna go blood on. With all due respect, sir, I don’t see how a piece of paper written by us is going to bring an end to a holy war that’s been raging for over 2000 years. Captain, you may be right. But somebody has to start the ball rolling. This is the first step. Who knows maybe the rest will be a little less difficult. Yeah? Oh, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come calling so late. No, it’s all right. Would you like to come in? So, what’s on your mind? What makes you think I’ve got something on my mind? Because I know that mind, it’s always working a mile a minute. I just wanted to thank you, away from the others. I know your history with the Admiral, so it’s obvious that he would invite you. Thank you very much for inviting the rest of us. I wasn’t expecting it because of our recent... Well… Sometimes I can be a jerk. But I would never hold back something someone deserved. And you deserve this. I should be leaving. Yeah, you’re probably right. So you’re it? From the network, camera crew? You must be, there’s no else around here. Oh, damn, is it hot. I’m sweating right through my jacket. I don’t know how you people deal with it. Do you speak English? Oh, screw it. What the hell, as long as you point and shoot. Come on, let’s get going. I’ve got a bad back. Amidst all the celebration the Arab World Peace Treaty has produced, there is backlash to today’s signing. Syrian Leader Ahmald-Amar Sayda was under heavy dispute for agreeing to terms which members of his own staff called unreasonable. Peace? But at what costs? The effects of this peace treaty... ...will be more detrimental than 10 times the aftermath of war. In a few minutes, we’ll be going live to Norman Sears who’s on board the "USS Nimitz" for today’s coverage of this historical signing. Hey, come on, come on, guy’s move it! I smell Emmy. Here's your camera, sir. Hey, here, get this shot. Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing? -Sacred pen. -Sacred wrist. Thanks. I hope our Navy coffee is as good as your Army stuff. Oh, look, there are some people I want you to meet. Casey, Tom, Maddie, this is Tyler Haynes of the Army Special Forces. He’s here as a guest of the Joint Chiefs. -Pleasure. -The pleasure is all mine. Now, Major Haynes is up for re-assignment. So I thought perhaps you two should have a talk? That sounds good to me. -What are we waiting for, Admiral? -The President is a tad late. He's arriving by a helicopter. You know, for all the great Clinton, you could always depend on him being on time. Com, this is zero-one-niner approaching on port bow. Permission to land. Zero-one-niner, you are clear to land. Mr President, welcome. Speak of the devil. Excuse me. -Very good to see you. -You too, sir. -Admiral. -Mr President. Right on time. Minister, please sit down. Everyone, take your seats, please. Thank you! Thank you for coming and welcome. Welcome, to the distinguished dignitaries, the honored guests, and indeed to a whole world yearning for peace. I must tell you that it is a very great honor for me to host this occasion. I first must thank the four great world leaders who have made this day possible. When I was a young man, peace in the Middle East seemed unattainable, rather like a dreamer’s fantasy. For the wisdom, the energy, the work, and devotion of these four great leaders have made that dream a reality. Now of course, I know that this one single document... ...is not going to erase the many centuries of discord. However, perhaps if we can agree on one issue, other issues will not seem so far away. There are people all over the world today watching us, yearning, believing that perhaps we can have a peaceful settlement here. And if that is so, perhaps there can be peace everywhere. -Gun! -Where? Get the President out of here. Stop! Stop! Sound the alert! Secure all stations! Sir, the Syrian President has been wounded! Get the medic. Maddie, stay with me. Casey, Tyler, that way! Down! -Maddie. -I’m fine, I’m fine. -Go! Go! Go! -Wait. Go! Corporal, we need to get him to OR stat, He’s going into shock, we need to do this now. Sayda? Colonel, incoming message. Wait, don't move him. Take her to the infirmary. -What happened to her? -She bumped her head, possible concussion. Is that bullet still inside? Yes, it’s about two inches deep. Look, he doesn’t have the time for this. I need to get him to medical. He has a massive amount of internal bleeding. He’s not going anywhere. That bullet contains an explosive element of some kind. If you go in there blind or make the slightest wrong move, you may trigger it to pop. -Okay, supply room now. -Okay, easy. Com, this is Admiral Torrance, get the President out of here now. Yes, sir, the eagle’s on the pad. It’s about the lift off. We need to keep him stable until we find out exactly what’s inside of him, okay? Look, if we can’t take him to medical, we’re going to bring the medical to him. I need an IV, a respirator, the works. My gun! Thank you. Dickson! I lost him. -Can you give me your gun? -I got it right here. Let's go. Did you find them? Dickson found one but no luck on the other. There are a million places he could hide on a ship like this. Freeze! Lets go. Not much is known at this hour. President Mitchell, rushed off the aircraft carrier, moments after conveyed his deepest condolences, for the breakdown of the treaty signing. He wished for all sides to put this event aside as soon as possible, and to resume the peace process. -Anything further from Shaval? -Negative, Colonel. I wonder if President Sayda’s alive or dead? It doesn’t matter one way or the other. If he is alive, he is being held against his will. If he is dead, they’ll have to assume full responsibility. Either way, our objective remains the same. President Sayda’s condition maybe a good opportunity for propaganda. But the nuclear weapons center remains our only means of bargaining with the Americans. Captain, I don’t want to take any chances. Get those birds in the air now. I’ll report to Central. Any new information? The battle group is securing the region. And the assassins? One confirmed dead, the second one jumped off the ship. SER teams are in the water now searching for the body. President Mitchell? He’s on board Air Force One and heading home. Alright, I want to step up security in the Gulf for the time being. This may only be an isolated incident but we don’t want to be caught with our pants down again. Yes, sir. Two-zero-seven, this is Two-zero-one. Any signs of life out there? Negative, Coast One. Nothing out there but blue sky. Roger that. We’ll head back. Let Dragon Squadron take the limelight. Roger that. -How are you feeling? -Fine. I think I’ve got every drug loaded to my gun inside me. Which accounts for my euphoric disposition. -How’s everything in the real world? -Fine. You sound as convincing as me. Well, good news is we got the bad guys. Bad news is, we don’t know the who, where or why’s. All the important stuff. You look tired. Why don’t you just rest up a little bit, I’ll be back. -Tom? -What is it? Thank you. Amanda, wait up! Where do you think you’re going? Sizzler! All you can eat salad bar ends at 11. Where do you think I’m going? I should have been there in the first place. It was Norman’s crew that took the shot. If I had been there, like I should have been, the peace treaty would have been signed because I would have checked their credentials and not made an ass out of myself! Now, I’m leaving tonight I’ll be in the Gulf in the morning, and I'm going to win my Emmy. Amanda. Amanda, I need you here. I’m warning you! Alright, you’d better get me some good stuff then. I hate my job. My friends, yesterday was to have been one of the world’s finest hours. Alas, it was not. An assassination attempt was made by an unknown group and failed yesterday, aboard the "USS NIMITZ". Unfortunately, President Abdul Amil Sayda was wounded in the chest. Although, details are sketchy, we believe the perpetrators may have been renegade factions from within the president’s own country, Syria. Safety measures will not allow the president to be moved until he has stabled. Let me assure you, that despite this cowardly act, the US and Syrian governments remain firmly committed to peace. Soon as new information is available, I shall share it with you, of course. Thank you. I mean, they had all the proper ID’s. I’ve picked up foreign crews hundreds of times over the years, and I’ve never had any trouble. When I turned around, and I saw that gun, I didn’t know what to do. This guy doesn’t even have the stomach to be a terrorist. -Now what? -Let the FBI have him. He’s all yours, gentlemen. They’ve got to have on video of these guys entering the room. With all the cameras that were there plus security, I’d say so. Well, maybe we can isolate the image, feed it off to Langley, and see what we’ve got on the guy. I’ll call Lieutenant Green, and get him to send up the available footage. Good. We have the right to know the truth. It was enough that we came down to their level. Agreeing to a deal that was unjustly balanced against our beliefs, But we did. We did it for hope and the promise of peace. What is our thanks? We are spat in the face. Belittled. The Americans have not given us one straight answer. We do not know what is and what is not the truth anymore. Whether our president is alive, dead. Nothing! That son of a bitch is making us out to be the bad guys. We have received several inquires, sir from many nations regarding the Syrian Leader situation. They want to know exactly what events transpired aboard the "NIMITZ". Alright, I want a secure line to "NIMITZ", ASAP. I want to know Sayda’s condition. Everything else is on a need-to-know basis until I know what statement the President is going to make. Also, get in communication with this Rama character, or whoever else is in charge, before this thing blows out of control. Yes, sir. Tom, you have anything yet? -Still looking. Any news on Sayda? -I was about to check. Lieutenant Blakely. This is Admiral Torrence. Any changes yet? Negative. He is stable. But we are waiting for the lab analysis of the other bullet before we proceeding any further. -Alright, keep me posted. -Yes, Admiral. Got it. A clean image of both terrorists. -Let’s get it into Washington right away. -Yes. I assure you, Colonel, we’re doing everything possible that can be done. I’m afraid that’s just not going to do. If you were serious about peace, sir, you would be doing much more to restore our faith. And how could I do that? I want hourly report on his health and not from you, from someone directly on the carrier. No more middlemen. I’ll see what I can do. Brilliant, sir. They’ll never suspect this is just a decoy for our real plan. Yeah. The images of the assassins are coming in, sir. Run that through the mainframe. I want to cross-reference it with every known militia or terrorist group. Yes, sir. Stan, it’s Amanda. -Where are you? -Damascus. Listen, I started talking to this man sitting next to me on the plane... Was he sick? No, why? Well, I always get stuck next to guy, with bubonic plague or something. He’s always sneezing or telling me his, whole life story all within about two... Shut up and listen, Stan. About 10 miles from here, there’s a weapon center that the UN has taken over. I found out, it had just become capable of launching nukes when this peace treaty stuff came down. And nobody knows this, Stan! -Well how does the healthy man know this? -His nephew’s in the military. So why is he telling you the family secrets? I paid him 8,000 piastres. Good God, Amanda, that’s... Actually, I have no idea how much that is. Could you bargain for 4,000? Good bye, Stan. I could really love her. Get me accounting. How much is 8,000 piastres? What is this? Wish that whoever designed this was on our side. What have we got? Oh, not much, just a regular 25 shell right here except for the tip, which can I call a beanie. The metallic compound found inside this beanie, right here, is explosive by nature. But it’s only harmful when the two elements come together. One of which is this green stuff right here that looks like paint. -But it’s not. -No, it’s not. Actually, it’s some sort of a solvent which acts with the trigger effect, when it comes into contact with something real hard like concrete or steel. -Bone? -Bone, exactly. This thing right here causes a spark, which creates the explosion. So there should be no problem taking this bullet out? -I don’t think it’s going to be that easy. -Why not? Well, we don’t know what kind of state it’s in now, sir. The slightest movement or scrape could set it off. -Correct? -That’s right. What could be done? You’re going to have to diffuse the bullet before you extract it. Can that be done? Probably, but it’s going to take some time. That’s one thing we don’t have? Look, the longer that man sits here with that bullet inside of him, the more at risk he becomes. Lieutenant, if President Sayda dies, so does all chance of peace in this area. Kabala, this is Rama. Launch Operation Aerial Diversion. We will be proceeding towards the weapons center as soon as the jets are airborne. Yes, Colonel. Hey, good afternoon, how are you doing? I have four unknown aircraft. 100 miles, at 140, at 300 knots, sir. Control tower, this is command center. Green light the birds immediately! Yes, sir. Yes, Mr President, I’ll have it for you as soon as it comes in. Yes, sir. Sir, reports have come back on the ID terrorists. I think you should see who their commander is. Is this information correct? Yes, sir. The assassins were taking orders from Colonel Abdul Rama. Get me the President. Big Eye this is Ghost One. I have multiple contacts. Bearing 081, 60 miles, 16,000 feet. Nose Eye, that is confirmed. Big Eye, bandit, bandit, red in frame, two of them just broke formation. They’re coming right at us. Roger that 201, stay on course. Get me the CO. Admiral Torrence. I’ll be right there. The Syrian jets just crossed the no-fly zone. Check and see what the doctor need in terms of assistance. I’m going with Torrence. Good? Ghost One, do you see this? Okay, we’ve got him, Falcon. Let’s just keep our heads. Approaching 30 miles. Increase speed up to 500 knots. -We’ve got 10 miles closure. -Copy that. As soon as those hornets are ready, I want them airborne. Aye, aye, sir. Here we go. -Check points secured? -Yes, Colonel, all check points secured. Go! Everyone, down! Ghost Two, sorting left-hand bandit. Roger that, I’ve got one in behind. He’s coming around. Break away, he’s going target missiles lock! Falcon, where are you? He’s all over me. Stop! Stop! He’s stuck to me like a glue. I can’t shake him, damn it! He’s going for weapons lock. -He’s got a lock on me. -Falcon, break hard right, now! Shit, that was close! Hang in there. I’m going to try to get behind him. Come on, you bastard. I got him. I’m going for missile lock. Come on baby, lock. I got sweet lock, baby, switching to missiles. That one made it. Alright, now, let’s see what his friend is up to. Secure the perimeter. And back some cover. The rest stay with me. We’re going in. Move! Move! Okay, he’s following me. I’m going to lead him into your line of fire. Shit. As soon as you have a shot, take it, Falcon! If you're clear, Hollywood, I think I can get it. Come on, come on. Here we go. Come on, come on, lock! I got lock! Look at him go! There’s a new sheriff in town. The other two are still out there, Falcon. Let’s just wait and see what they do before we make a move. This is Amanda Crawford in a "ZNN Exclusive". We’re coming to you from the Syrian Weapons Center, just outside Damascus where around the clock, workers diligently labor to disable the nuclear launch code program executed by Syrian technicians during the war. What was that? This facility is now the property of the Syrian Government. -What’s that? -Info on the terrorists. Admiral, ring any bells? Karbala, operation close down. Recall and stand by. Yes, Colonel. Recall! Big Eye, this is Ghost One. Remaining bandits are bugging out. I think we spooked them. Copy, Ghost One. Stand down and return home. Roger that. Yes. Right. Bring up A-57 on the map. -What’s that? -A stress signal. -From where? -Syrian Weapons Center. It’s a decoy. It’s a decoy. Okay. General, we have Center Com on the "Nimitz" on line. Admiral. Tom Dickson is here at your request, General. Good, thank you. I don’t know if you’re aware of this or not, but early today while our jets were engaging the Syrians, a weapons center in Damascus under guard by the United Nations was taken over. This facility contains nuclear capabilities not yet dismantled by UN officials. Our best Intel tells us that it could be fully operational within 12 to 18 hours. Our prime suspect is the man in the photograph we sent you. -Colonel Rama. -Precisely. Rama’s made it clear that he was not in favor of his country’s intentions to end the war. He’s win-at-all-costs colonel. Our sources have him connected with starting many of the anti-treaty terrorists groups, as well as bombing and Tel Aviv. And we believe that Colonel Rama, planted the assassins. Damn, that’s the same lunatic that’s been on ZNN all day berating us, for not protecting their leader. These are massive manipulations here. He’s planting the seed, that we’re the bad guys in the world’s eyes. More importantly, sir, in his country’s eyes, Giving them a logical excuse to start the war back up again. So, he not only has the motivation for war, he has the devices for starting it himself. Excuse me. Hello, I don’t know if you’re familiar with my work. I’m Amanda Crawford. I’m a news reporter. If you allow me to say so, sir. I completely understand your side of this. -You do? -Absolutely. I feel your pain! If you would let me, I would love to do an exclusive expose on you and your people. I think the world needs to know. These people make me sick. The world will know my story soon enough without your help. -Take them outside. -Yes, Colonel. Yeah? Yeah, I’ll be right there, boss. Yeah? She’s doing better. Alright. I got to go, sugar. What’s going on? I don’t know, but I’ve heard that tone before. -Let me know? -Positively. We’ve got him. Mr President? -Are Cent Com on the "NIMITZ" tied in? -Yes, sir. We’re here, sir. Mr President? -President Michelle here. -Mr President. I wish we could be speaking on better terms. Due to your recent unprovoked attack on our country, we have no option but to assume that your request for peace is no longer. Unprovoked? I believe that your aircraft fired on our first. I beg to differ. I have no choice but to report you to NATO for violating the cease-fire agreement. Well, that shouldn’t be too big of a problem. We have a contingent stationed at the Weapons Center Damascus. Weapons center? I know not of what you speak. I hear in your voice, however, that you truly care to make amends for your actions. That makes me very happy, sir. What are you proposing? The immediate withdrawal of all UN forces from my country. And the swift and safe return of President Sayda. You know very well, the man cannot be moved. And how can I trust you? If my demands are not met, Mr President I will create problems that you cannot possibly fathom. You have 12 hours. Stay on the line, Admiral. Mr President, there is not doubt in my mind that no matter what we do, he is going to launch his nukes, as soon as he is capable. I don’t think we have any choice. We should launch a full strike immediately. I’m not going to start this war again because of a hunch, General. Sir, our best intelligence men, all CIA profiles, any and all signs all say the same thing. This lunatic is not going to reason, he’s not going to bargain, he’s going to launch as soon as he’s capable. Sir, you said it yourself, he has the motivation and the devices. Before I fire missiles, General I must be sure that we’ve exhausted every possibility. Mr President, there may be another way. We don’t have much time before they’re completely operational, I’d like to volunteer my team to go in. Commander, your bravery is duly noted, but I have short-ranged nuclear armed warheads pointing all over Europe and Asia. There's simply isn’t enough time for strike force to go in while we wait for result. Sir, I wasn’t suggesting you wait. If we’re not out by the determined strike time... Commander, you are putting your life and the lives of your men in jeopardy. Sir, there are a lot of lives at stake here, American lives, if we don’t at least make an effort. What are we waiting for? Give the devil his due. Okay, get me command. -I want to go. -I was counting on that. Head down with Casey, start gear check. We’ll meet in the ready room in 10. I’m going with you. -Absolutely not, out of the question. -Why? I’m not going to risk you out there, not in your condition. Tom, this is as much my team as it is any of the others and I’m not sitting this one out. I’m not going to make the same mistake twice. Well the doctor’s given me a clean bill of health, a mild concussion. Tom, I know what I’m getting myself into, and if you’re going in, I’m going in, too. Besides, exactly how are you going to shut down a weapons mainframe without a technology expert along for the ride? We come in right here, just north of Damascus. Okay, we leave in 15 minutes. Sweep One will locate the weapons control room. Sweep Two the hostages. Tyler, you’ll have a new partner. One of the Admiral’s Navy Seals is going to be your point man. Who’s going to stay with you? -Man, are you crazy? -We need her to disable the system. I wouldn’t put myself or the team at risk if I wasn’t 100 percent certain. Welcome back. Admiral? Alright, UN Intel correlates with our most recent TARPS Pod imagery. Fences line the building. Satellite photos reveal 10 or 20 guards outside at any give time. They seem to be working in shifts, so we should be able to find a hole. You have four hours and 15 minutes until they are fully operational, and we have to let one country sign. Now, there is no set detention center, at least not one that we know of, which means the hostages can literally be anywhere. We don’t know how many soldiers are in the facility. So discretion is a top priority. Also, we don’t want them pushing the panic button before we destroy the mainframe to keep them from launching. Got it. They won’t even know we’re there. Go. Don't worry ma'am, were the good guys. Come on! Come on, come on! Come on,come on. Follow us. Let's go! Let's go! Let's get out of here. Okay. There it is. I’ll watch your back. In the middle of a mission, they keep radio silence with the outside so that we are unable to contact them. If anything, and I mean, anything happens out of the ordinary, report to me before firing. I know this isn’t an easy assignment for any of you. But it is for the greater good. God be with you. Oh, shit. Big Eye, this is Ghost One, I’m ready for final checks. 20 minutes and counting. I’ll be approaching Syrian air space in 10 minutes. Roger that, Ghost One. Maintain speed and course. Hey, so much for a quiet get away. Come on, come on! Shit. Okay, okay. Big Eye this is Ghost One. I’m entering Syrian air space, advancing to designated target coordinates. Roger, Ghost One. Proceed with caution. They have 10 minutes. Target coordinate set. Entering data into the computer. -How's it going? -Okay. -Is it working? -Maybe. Madeline, we don’t have a lot of time here! Do you want me to stop and explain this to you, or do you want me to shut down the thermos-nuclear missiles? -The missiles. -Good choice. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Let’s go, let's go, let's go! Come on, come on. Let’s go. Big Eye, target is visible on radar. I’ll be within firing range in three minutes. Copy, Ghost One, stay on course. Come on. Yes! Got it! Big Eye, this is Ghost One. Requesting final clearance for weapons release. Stand by, Ghost One. They still have two minutes. Don’t we have a call to make? It was supposed to be a New World Order, but once again you’ve drained me. You may have won the war, but it’s going to cost you your life. Ghost One, this is Big Eye, you are go for weapons release. Repeat, you are go for weapons release. Copy that, Big Eye. -You okay? -Yeah, you? He’s tough guy to kill, huh? Apparently. This is for you. Shit. Run! -Pretty sure he’s dead this time. -Yeah, I think you’re right. Big Eye, I’m on final approach. Weapons system on line. Arming missiles. Big Eye, this is Sweep One. Mission accomplished. Nuclear threat aborted. -Yeah! -Recall the birds. -Recall those squadrons, abort mission. -Thank God they did it! Ghost One, this is Big Eye. Disengage. Repeat, disengage. Stand down and return home. Roger that, Big Eye. I’m heading home. This is Freedom Strike, what’s your position? I’m heading out on the north. I’ll be on deck in 60 seconds. Affirmative, we’re on our way. Come on, let’s get out of here, come on. -Okay. -Come on. Got it. Be careful, that thing could still be hot. And after several failed attempts, today marked the completion of the Arab World Treaty. President Mitchell was quoted as saying, "Today will be a day long remembered in the history of the modern world." We thank you for joining us tonight. Stay tuned for my special expose, "Hostage: The Amanda Crawford Story". This special takes you through the odyssey of my capture, to how I was able to help comfort my fellow prisoners. This is Tom leave a message. Tom, it's Tyler. I'm calling to see how you were doing. Anyway, I know you’re probably going through some awkward times at home, about Maddie being transferred. I just want to let you know I’m there for you. Hey, how about a trip to Vegas? It'll help you live to get your mind off something Let me know. I’ll see you. Do you think we should tell the boys? No. It’s more fun like this.
