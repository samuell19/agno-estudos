Right, left. Right, left. Right left .. Hello, George. Are my kids in there? Yes, sir. This is the family car, Mr Flynn. Mr Flynn, I ain't going to ask for no fares this time. You got a good show? - You bet your life. She's a wow. She's a wow, George. There you are. Take the family. Yes, sir. Hey, Peggy, who stole my photographs? - How should I know? I'll believe you this time. Something phony about all this. They disappeared. Uhuh. So you took my pictures? - What will you do with them, Joe? Send them to Paris to be used as postcards. - Oh yeah? You cut that out, Joe Flynn. - No resistance, eh? You hurt my pride. Say Joe, this one makes me look a little bit tough. Maybe you should have worn something on that face of yours. Nature in the raw is seldom nice. Joe, can't you use my picture for that soap Ad? You know the line: "I'm only seventeen". And four makes thirty-two. Say, what's the idea of this Landers dame all dressed up like an Eskimo? While we are togged out in our birthday suits? Come on, Joe. Give. Who is she? - Yeah. She is Tony Landers. - Tony? Ain't that the name of a horse? - Yeah. She's a nice kid from a nice home so lay off, lay off. Little Miss Innocent, huh? And the angels watch over the innocent. Even the show's angel, eh Joe? - Shush. Cutting is in the drawing room. So the head man has given Aileen the gate, huh? Aileen, will you stop playing that phonograph. Hey Joe, have we got to suffer because she has got to suffer? By the way, where is Tony Landers? She is back in New Haven. - New Haven? Yeah, an old boyfriend of hers barged in full of college-boy spirits. You know, with a song in his heart. And a shoe full of gin in his throat. And was he tight. It's okay. Flip Daly is with her. So that's why Flip said she couldn't make the train, eh? Sure. She was too busy making the team. Oh, hello Sid. - Sid? Oh. I thought you were the stage manager. He always does that. Is my face red. Take it easy, Aileen. You didn't think it would last forever, did you? You'd give two weeks' notice to a parlor-maid who collects dust. Wouldn't you? Yeah, but not when they collect gold dust. Relax, Aileen. Relax. I don't understand it, Joe. This Landers kid has no class. You now, no clothes, no car, no .. No rocks. What does Craig .. Mister Cutting, see in her? She's got no flash. No Park Avenue smartness. Maybe it's because she's got no flash .. And no Park Avenue smartness. Howdy, Joe. - Here are the pictures, Lew. Mr Cutting wanted to see them. - Sure, Thanks. I'll give them for the display. Wait until they get a load of my theater. I mean our theater. You know Craig, I still can't get over it. The Lewis Gordon Theater. All my life I dreamed of having my own playhouse. And you made it possible. Now don't worry about the show. That's in the bag. Did you see the way they all ate it up? I'll make a prediction. I predict you get your dough back within six weeks. What do you know about that? What is the name of that college boy that waited for Tony? Huh? I'm sorry. What were you saying? Oh, it wasn't important. By the way. That florist made a mistake. He sent Tony Landers roses. Well? Well, it is none of my business .. But you usually send orchids. Orchids are well-kept flowers for well-kept ladies. This one happens to be the rose type. She's a pooch type too, I guess. I couldn't help seeing that pup you sent her. You are very observing, aren't you Lew. - Yes. You see everything, don't you. Yep. I even saw that college kid pick her up after the show. Good old Yale. I guess I'm not the type anymore, huh? Maybe that pooch should have been a string of pearls instead. You don't have to house-break pearls. - That's right. Oh, yeah? I can't open this peroxide bottle. You'll have to do with that one. Say, am I going to be a real blond now? Sure, as long as no-one looks at your hair. Is that my toothbrush? - You'll get it back in a minute. Well, the nerve of her. Will you turn off that fan. I'm getting pneumonia. Hey kids, listen. Lillian Blaine married a millionaire. When? - Last night. What time? - All night, dearie. How are the roots? - Still black. Will you turn that fan off. Hey, kids. You should have got a load of Aileen's face. It's a lucky thing that Landers dame isn't on this train. And I bet Cutting is sore. He took an extra drawing-room. So as they could talk things over? Is she really dumb or is that an act? - She ain't so dumb. That college kid is Robert North 3rd. Why didn't she get Robert North the 1st? Anybody with "3rd" after their name sounds like ready money to me. Here is your toothbrush. - Thanks. Okay. Gee, you haven't changed a bit. Still the same old kid I was so crazy about. Were you? You certainly went to a lot of trouble not to let me know about it. Well, how could I when you were always pulling my pigtails? And did you beat me up. - I'm awful sorry. Did I hurt you much? Well, let me make it better. Oh, Bob. Not in front of all these .. Go on, it's getting chilly. - No thanks. You didn't drink when you were in high school. And you didn't run around in tights. How'd you happen to get into the chorus? - My stomach. Hmm? - I had to feed it. How did you get the job? Lucky break. I was trying to cash those bonds mother left me when I met Mr Cutting. Who is he? - Head of the brokerage firm. You know Craig Cutting? Sportsman. Society. He is even backing our show. Oh, I see. No you don't. Not when you say it that way. I'm sorry. He is alright. He got me this job so I wouldn't have to cash those bonds. I know that type. I bet he sends you orchids. Uhuh. Roses. Oh. And pearls. Hasn't he given you pearls? Now listen. If you are going to act like a kid I'm walking out on you. Besides, I told Flip I'd come back to the hotel early. Wait a minute, Tony. I got to go. - No. Yes. No. - Yes. [ Telephone ] Hello? Ten o'clock? Okay. Tony. Tony! Well, are you ready? - Yes. Say, Aileen is certainly washed up. He didn't even invite her to the party. Aren't you losing your hair? - I am not. Well, you will if you don't stop cracking. Somebody turn that thing off. I'm tired of hearing that Egbert march. Don't you think you'd better get used to it? Roses. The old story, I guess. Chorus girl gets the air while thousands yawn. Well. I shouldn't squawk though. He was a swell guy. He used to end me dividend checks regularly. He handled my money. And was he generous. This was for nothing. And what technique. He used to say: "Listen dear". "About your career". "I don't want to try to force you into anything." Well, when he put it that way .. - Gee, I'm afraid we will be late. Craig's parties never start until one. Give my regards to the cook. Look, one more crack like that and your neck gets tangled up with my fingers. She is plenty burned up, believe me. I wasn't thinking about her. I wonder if Craig will mind my bringing Bob. If you're counting on him doing handsprings you'll be disappointed. What's he been doing with himself lately? Bob? Oh, he's been busy. Studying. I know. With his nose deep in a book. Where is Miss Tony Landers' dressing room? This one, two, three. It's the last room across the hall. Who took my cold-cream? Telegram for you, Tony. Thanks. Will you put the rose in some water please. Oh, gee. I sort-of expected him this time. Love. The tenth word in the telegram. Cheer up, kid. Wait until you get to that party. With a few drinks under your evening gown .. You'll forget what town you are in. Say, Flip. What did Aileen mean about those dividend checks? Well, that's one way of putting it. - What do you mean? This is your first show. Wait. You will learn. And that crack she made about his technique. She was trying to rib you. Say, you can ask more questions .. I need a clean towel. Get me one too will you. We're the only ones here. No you're not. There's millions of people. Bunny. Shush. Oh, he is broadcasting. Hello everybody. For the past half hour you have been listening to Swift Goldfarb. And his alpine laddies. Oh, poor Bunny is crying. Come on, we'll get little Bunny some lettuce. Do you want an olive? There may be a guest or two in here. Listen everybody. Listen. I would like to present .. Maybe they would rather be alone. Tony Landers social debut: Cloudy followed with showers. I'll get you a drink. Yeah, she would go. Hello, Yale. You look down. Well, I know a speakeasy that specialises in crying jags. How would you like to join me in a quiet ball? For what? For, we have been given the air. - Huh? Landers drops you and I'm bounced by Cutting. Some fun, huh kid? - What are you talking about? I thought Yale made you dumb boys bright. Tony is with Cutting now. - What? Tony .. is .. with .. Cutting .. now. Where? At his penthouse. Did you ever see it? It's a swell joint. Soft lights. Soft music and soft pillows. I'm a lady what knows. Oh yeah? I'm driving by that way. Can I drop you? No thanks. Okay. Hey, wait a minute. Gee, this place is swell. I've never seen anything so grand. A bad girl can have good times here. My dear. I don't to force into doing anything .. - Anything you don't want to do. It's not the Cutting technique. I know all about it. First, flowers. Then gifts. And then the good old Cutting technique. What do you mean? Who have you been talking to? Little Cinderella has a motorcycle. She gets around. What else does little Cinderella know? That she is not going to be part of your annual show. What show? The Craig Cutting Follies. Last year the spirit of Cutting was a brunette. This year he had hoped it would be a blond. Isn't it an old routine? Rich man. Are you serious? Is that what you really think? I get dividend checks from you, don't I? Listen, Tony. I wouldn't offend you for anything in the world. I want you to know that I .. - More technique. Craig. Can I see those checks you sent me? The cancelled ones. Why, of course. Certainly. Did any of this money come from my bonus? What do you think? I wish I hadn't been so stupid. I really thought .. Little Cinderella. What difference does it make? - It does make a difference, Craig. I .. You have made me obligated to you. Why, I haven't even thanked you for the job. You needn't thank me. But I'm afraid there is nothing I can do in return. No. I'm afraid not. I beg your pardon. Bob. Gee, I'm glad to see you. After your wire I didn't expect you. This is Mr Cutting - Bob North. - How do you do, Mr North. Come, get your things. We're leaving. - Just a moment. Miss Landers happens to be my guest. She also happens to be my wife. May I congratulate you. - What are those? Nothing. Nothing at all. - Come on. Let's see them. You certainly kept her well. - Bob, you don't think .. Don't lie to me! You dirty little tramp. Bob! Oh Craig, tell him he's wrong. I'm sorry, Tony. I've made it a rule never to interfere in domestic affairs. You should have said you were married. - I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell anyone. He'd have been kicked out of school. Don't let him think that you and I .. - I'm sorry, Tony. I think it is best that I don't interfere. But ..? I would like to see Mr Robert North Junior. Who shall I say is calling? - Mrs .. Miss Landers. Will you come in please. Two tickets and a drawing room. Yes. For Montreal. But I ordered them this morning. North. N-O-R-T-H. Haven't you made that reservation yet? - They're looking you up now, sir. Well hang up and go down there and tell Mr Keith I must have them right away. Yes, sir. Have they come for the trunks? - They're here. Alright. Yes? Mr North, I am Miss Landers. - Yes. I know all about that. I am not taking those. - They are Mr Robert's, sir. He won't take them either. I'd like to see Bob, Mr North. - What do you want to see him about? I'd rather discuss that with him. - You can't see him. But I've got to. - You came here to make some trouble. But you will not have a chance to. - No, I haven't. I just want to talk to Bob. Don't you see? He is my husband. - I know that. I also know all about you and your friend Cutting. If you're smart you will leave this house now. And forget about Bob. He is not interested in you. And he doesn't intend to see you again. - I don't believe that. Do all these go? - Yes. And one upstairs. If he was here he would see me. I know he would. Mr North, please! Bob! Hey, Frank. You see the same thing I do? - Yes, sir. Thank you very much. - Okay. Good evening, Miss Landers. - Hello, Frank. Tried to pull a fast one, didn't you? - Nice work, kid. Ask Craig if he remembers me. You know, Aileen the amateur. I tell you boys she's a sweet kid with a broken heart. Who broke it? - Love. Whistle it .. - On the level. Here she is married to this rich North kid. Along comes Cutting and bing! She throws away a fortune. Yeah, for Cutting's dough. - He's not the marrying kind. Now you mugs print that yarn I gave you. Hey, wait a minute, No cracks now. And remember she is just a kid. - With a broken heart. Put it to music and it would still be lousy. I just came to get my things and to turn in my notice. What for? I'm sorry about all this mess and those newspaper stories. Why, what are you talking about? I am going to raise your salary. But I'm not staying. I am through. But Tony, you can't quit on me like this. Come on, sweetheart. The boys are lined up. - What boys? Cameramen and reporters. They're going to take pretty pictures. Are they? Not of me. Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Let's talk this over. Sure, Tony. Sure. Listen kid, you're sitting pretty. All you got to do is play your cards right. What are you talking about? - Listen, sweetheart. You're floating on the crest of a wave. You are the talk of the town. You're the first girl that's ever got anything in Craig. The divorce, the divorce. - And did those papers give it a play. You're made, kid. You've got the world by the tail. Let old Joe handle this and you'll be famous. Kids work all their lives to get in the spot you are in. And you have got it right in your lap. Notoriety, publicity, the spotlights! All yours. Cash in on it. Sure. Go and raise a racket. If you don't break it, it will break you. See those dames? Not much talent. Publicity. That's what helped them to state their claim. And they have got plenty of gold since then. I'll get those mugs. Hello, Craig. Hello. You ought to squawk to the papers. That was an awful picture they printed. Wasn't it. It must be hard to be brought into court after all these years. After what years? All these years of playing around. And being so careful not to be seen with married women. You ought to know me well enough not to believe those lies. If I had known Tony was married I .. Goodnight, Aileen. You would leave, wouldn't you. Just a bit higher. I want to get more expression. Now give us your dirty beast sort-of a look. Hold it please. What a broken heart. This heart is due for a long vacation. - With pay? What do you think? Come on, kid. You're in the opening chorus. - Alright. Goodbye. - Thank you. Tony. I came to ask you who your lawyer is. Lawyer? What for? You are contesting the suit, aren't you? No. Why? Have you lost your mind? Maybe. Do you want North to think he is right about us? What difference does it make? Tony. I'll get an attorney to represent you. I don't like scandal and notoriety. I'd rather not have it. - No? No. And you'll help me out of this mess. - Why should I? You weren't interested in helping me when I needed you. Why should I help you now? Well. It would be the decent thing to do. Maybe. If I were interested. But I am not. Now you are being stubborn. Don't get hurt. Not again. Do you really want the newspapers to think that you and I have had an affair? Why not? Bye, boys. - Hey, Joe. Find Lew Brown and get him to write her a song. Can she sing? - Who cares? And listen. You'd better change her dressing-room. Take her out of that chorus room and put her in six. Okay. "Let bygones be bygones forever." "Forget the past." "Though it wasn't pleasant, forgive me." "And I will endeavour." "To make amends for all that I have done." "Give me one more chance." This gentleman is waiting downstairs. Julie. Be sure to tell Miss Landers I want to see her. Oui, Monsieur. They are beautiful. There are some people to see you. - Get rid of them. I don't want to see anyone except Berger. George. He is waiting for you. - A prince, Julie. A real prince? He is rich and dull enough to be a real prince. Tony, I tried all week to see you. Now, that number you sing .. I haven't time, Lew. Please. But that song is four years old. - Who cares? Those sightseers are too busy gaping to listen. Mr Berger. Look, I'd like you to chance the number. - Like a good boy, Lew. Tomorrow. Send him in. Julie. See if the car is here. Hello, Eddie. - Good evening. Eighty-five hundred. Alright. I want a paste duplicate, just as you made these. I'll have it ready Friday. - Chester. Mr Berger will give you a check. Deposit it along with the others. Goodnight, Miss Landers. - Goodnight. Say. Joe Flynn has been pumping me about big fella. What? - Yeah. He wants to know how much dough he's got and those mysterious weekends of yours. What else does he know? Don't worry. He thinks it's big Eddie Malone. Oh. But you'd better watch your step. I guess I'll have to move again. Tired of it all. Nope. Just tired. Why don't you be a niece girl and go to bed? Where have I heard that before? This ice has certainly gone to your heart. You mean to my bank account. As fast as I get them I turn them into money and put it in a little trust fund. That's going to do you a lot of good. And as soon as it is 200 grand .. White lady, she retire. I am hysterical. I am practically laughing. I'm going to give this bird back to the Indians. I'll find a nice quiet little place. Where there is no tabloids or dirt. And now little kiddies, for the rest of the bedtime story. Once upon a time there was a prince. That reminds me. A cigarette, please. - Yes, sir. Mademoiselle. Delighted. The flowers are too divine. The car, Alec. - Yes, sir. Now. You would think she'd appreciate what I did for her. Doesn't she? - No. All the thinks of is her cut of the gross. What do you want? - Can I see you a minute, Mr Gordon? Sure. Craig. - Tony. Has it been four years or a hundred and four? When did you get back? - This morning on the Berengaria. Were you out front? - Of course. I couldn't qualify as a New Yorker unless I saw you. How did you like me? I was properly impressed. I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle. Tell the prince I am very sorry. Very well, Mademoiselle. Do I take preference over Royalty? - Over everyone. Thanks, Tony. My car. My car. Shall we send them both home? - Alright. A taxi? - A taxi. A taxi, Paul. Remember the pooch? - Of course. He was nothing but a speck the last time I saw him. He's been a constant reminder of you. You've developed a subtle gift for flattery. Here is our cab. I won't need the car, Paul. - Yes, madam. The Russian Club. You seem unusually kind to me. Why? Perhaps because of the publicity. Wouldn't this make an intriguing item for the papers. "Tony Landers rekindles first flame." You got a cigarette? Tony. Why do you tell me these things? - Don't they amuse you? No. I thought you were interested in my career and that I am famous and rich. I am vitally interested in you. - Then you should be very proud. Just why? Because you made such a smart businesswoman of me. I did? Remember how childish I was about those .. Dividend checks? I know better now. If that's my influence. I am certainly sorry. - I'm not. I am extremely grateful. What a pretty doll. Look Craig, it is saying: give me, give me, give me. Ten dollars please. Thank you, sir. Give me, give me, give me. Tony. - Yes? I .. Isn't that your song they are playing? How does it feel to be famous? You ought to know. "To make amends." "For all I have done." You are crying. Don't be silly. It's a trick I use to put over my songs. Not for me. You got the wrong girl, mister. I'll never need one. Shall we go? - Yes, let's. Next time it won't be so dull. We'll get tight and ring doorbells. Taxi. I'll take you home. - But I am not going home. I never go home on weekends. You mean that you are going to ..? - You're right. I'll not be alone. Well, aren't you afraid of another scandal? No. I'm not afraid of getting into the newspapers. Oh, I remember. You never did like publicity, did you? You should have kept your date with the prince. It might have been more helpful. Goodnight, Mr Cutting. You must let me take you out sometime. 900 Park Avenue. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Take me 210 West 101st Street instead. Goodnight, big fellow. I like you better than you like me. Why? Because I don't wash your neck. Oh, my goodness. Hey, you monkey. Where are you? Oh where is he? Where is my big fellow? I know where you are. Now, you come on out. And I will count three. Come on. One. Two. Three! I'm not in there. Here I am! Oh, there you are! Oh, my goodness. What did I tell you about that thumb? Huh? That's it. Is this the one? Yes, Bixby. Please don't go away, Mama. I won't, honey. Shall we play some music? - Okay. Alright. Come on. Will you stop that. You're making me nervous. Here is Tommy now. Hello. Let's go someplace where we can talk. Okay. - Excuse us. Have a cigarette. Thanks. Hello, Bob. - How are you? How are you? Let's go up here. Anything wrong? Figure it out yourself. I mean to tell you Tommy .. - That check you gave was a phoney. You never did have an account with that bank. What about it? Nothing much. Only you got a flock of detectives on your tail. That's all. Gentlemen, what is your pleasure? A Sidecar. What do you want? - The same. You are in this as deep as I am. - Yeah. Only it happens that your name is signed to that check and not mine. Have some. They're good. They'll get their money alright. Sure. They are giving you until Monday to make good. Or what? You'd better drink. While you can. Come on. Don't worry, kid. Your old man will kick through. Not a chance, I'm .. I'm washed up at home. For good. You'd better get it somewhere. Fifteen grand? Maybe you can tell me how. No, Bixby. Just give him a cup of hot milk. Nothing else. That's right. Goodnight. Calling Bixby again? That's the third time tonight. How did kids get along before the telephone was invented? Listen, Flip. Nothing else is important. You can't imagine how I feel about that baby. Because I don't go round telling people. But nothing else matters. When he looks up at me and says: "Mummy". Oh .. But wait. Wait until you have one of your own. You'll find out. Come on. Let's get back to Craig. How is the paint job? - You are okay. Come on. Hey, Pete. Another Sidecar. The way I feel I could drink a freight train. Hey, look. Do you see what I see? I remember when she was only my wife. She is doing alright now. You gave her a great front-page start, sonny-boy. Say, would she help you? Don't be funny. There is some talk about her and some guy. They got a hideaway someplace. - What of it? Hmm, that's good. Are you and she on speaking terms? - No. How do you know? Have you ever tried? No. Don't be silly. Anything is worth a try. Why don't you go on over and say hello? The only time she lets me talk money to here is in a speakeasy. Then I get crocked and can't talk money. Hello, Tony. Glad to see you. Would you like to dance? Thanks, Craig. Do you see him often? - Once in a while. We were never that close before. Let's not talk about him. Why did you refuse to speak to me when I phoned you? If it hadn't been for Lew Gordon I wouldn't be here tonight. You know that. I think you are the most disagreeable man I ever knew. While we are being personal .. You must have a fair idea of what I think of you. It's a lie. I'm really a very nice girl. And I'm really a very nice man. Then let's get together. What are you doing tomorrow afternoon? - I work. Yes. Believe it or not. I don't sit on top of a piano and sing songs. But I do work. You can spare an afternoon. Cocktails? Four o'clock? My place. Your place? - I said my place. 900 Park Avenue. What about your weekend friend? I see him weekends. Remember. We will be waiting for your call. Are you sure you know her? - Why, sure I know her. Drop me here, please. Taxi. Hello. Is this Bryant 2-4-0-1-1? 210 West 101st Street. Huh? Top floor. The name is Bixby. Yeah. She switched cabs on me. Bixby. Does that mean anything to you? I never heard of it. It's a phony I guess. No guy uses his real name on a hideout. He, you sap. Don't do that. Why not? If we walk in on her, she may be willing to talk business. Wasn't that the doorbell? - Yes. Shall I answer it? No, Bixby. Never answer the doorbell at any time. Yes, madam. Try and get in. Tony. Tony! Hello, Flip. - Hi. I phoned your other apartment and Bixby said you were here. Hmm. Nice flowers. Who from? - And admirer. Who? I bought them myself. Shall I fix the drinks now? - After a while, Julie. Say, what is going on? Come on, give out. Who are you expecting? Craig. You are kidding. - Uhuh. I invited him last night. You kinda like him, don't you. - Uhuh. Don't "Uhuh" me. You know you like him. How can you tell? Because you are all atwitter. [ Buzzer ] There he is. I'll go, Julie. You fix the drinks. I get it. I'll scram through the rear door. No. It is unlocked. Hello Tony. What do you want? Can you spare a minute? I'm sorry, I haven't time. - I won't keep you long. Well? I'm in a jam and I need some money right away. You've got plenty of nerve coming here. I wouldn't if I weren't so desperate. Dad won't help. - Now isn't that too bad. What makes you think I would help you? You can spare fifteen grand. I know you can. Not for you. Maybe I can get it from your boyfriend, Bixby. Who is Bixby? You don't know do you? - I haven't the faintest idea. He has a little flat at 210 West 101st Street. He doesn't answer doorbells on Saturday nights. You can't make good at anything can you. Not even blackmail. Get out of here before I call the police. Oh no you won't. - Get out. Maybe Bixby won't feel the same way about it. Julie. Operator. Give me Cathedral 1-1-2-3-6. And hurry. Get my things and send for the car. Quickly. Operator. Operator. Cathedral 1-1-2-3-6. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby. Bixby! Hello, Mummy! Oh, baby darling. What's the matter, ma'am? - We're going right now. But what about the things? Well get the things ready. Here is the key. Come on. Who is mummy's little man? - Me. What did I tell you about that thumb? You are not going to leave me anymore ever are you. No, Mummy. He's a lovely child. No wonder you are so proud of him. Hello, Tony. - Hello. I want you to meet a friend of mine, Tommy Davis. How are you. - How are you? I am okay. Maybe if you are leaving we can give you a lift. No thanks. I have my own car. That's a good-looking kid up there. Yes, isn't he. He is Mrs Bixby's grandson. Bixby, huh? How old is he? He is about four years old I guess. Small for his age. - Is he? I don't know much about children. You didn't waste much time getting here, did you. We followed you. What is it you want? Why did you leave your place in such a hurry to come here? I always come here at this time to take Mrs Bixby and her Grandson for a drive. Ain't that nice. Now if you don't mind, I'll wait. We'll all wait. Let's go for a ride now, Mummy. "Mummy", huh? Yes. What about it? Oh nothing. Nothing at all. Now get this and get it straight. I'm not afraid of a little more publicity. If either of you bother me again in any way, I'll go to the district attorney. Do you hear? Come on, Bixby. I don't want to ever see you two around here again. Alright, lady. So long, sonny. There goes the 15 grand. Pin money. Why, you can get 115 grand, fella. And a cut for me too. How? - That kid is yours. You're crazy. - Am I? What scared her into coming across? You did. She was afraid you'd tumble. I don't see how .. Listen, you sap. With that rep she has you can take the kid away from her, see. What's your father's phone number? What for? He's not interested. - Not in you. But he will be in the kid. Why, he'll go nuts about that little guy and he'll kick through with plenty. How do you know he will? - I'm positive. Now, what's that number? Murray Hill 6-1-0-2-4. Why not divide our losses? We can reorganise our finances. Miss Landers to see you. Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute. I phoned your apartment to say I'd be late. But your maid said you had left. What's the trouble? I need help Craig and I need it badly. I don't know what to do, which way to turn. What is it? I have a son, Craig. He's nearly four years old. My mysterious weekend friend. You have a son? - Yes. Bob is the father. And ever since that baby was born I've been in constant fear. Fear that the Norths would find out. I've hidden him. Moved him from place to place. Lied and chiselled to get money so I can take him where they wouldn't get him. You know what they could do legally. Yes. And I know North too. That's what terrifies me. Bob saw the boy today. Does he know him? - I'm sure he does. Well, you are in trouble. I can't tell the police. What can I do? Not much I'm afraid. Wait a minute. Bowling green 9-5-300. Yes. Hello? Hellman please. Mr Cutting. Hello Max? Now listen. Reserve a suite of rooms on any outgoing liner that sailing for Europe tonight. And you must get an emergency passport in the name of Miss Tony Landers. What? I don't care how you get it. Just get it. Fine. Alright. You and the boy leave this country tonight. Where shall we go? - To Paris. I have a house there. What about the show? - Don't worry. Leave that to me. Get your boy, pack your things and get on the boat and don't worry. Where is he? Where is he? I put him to bed only a few moments ago. He's gone? Julie! How did they get in? - I don't know. I was .. There was two men. They said they had an appointment. Who were they? - One was Mr North. Upon what do you base your opinion of .. Miss Landers unfitness to care for your son's child? It's just common knowledge. The woman is notorious. Everyone knows what she is. I object and I ask Mr North's answer be stricken out. Hearsay is not evidence. This is not hearsay. It can be proven. Objection overruled. That's all, Mr North. Your witness. - No questions. Your Honor, we rest our case. - Call the next witness. Miss Landers. Order in the court. - Raise your right hand please. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give .. Will be the truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Be seated please. What is your name? Antoinette Landers. Miss Landers. The child in controversy is your son, is he not? Yes. - Where was he born? In a boarding house near the east river. House number? If you haven't forgot it. I couldn't forget it. 20 East Front Street. Why did you go there? - Because it was cheap. You had very little money? You mean, after I paid all my expenses? Yes. - About four dollars. Did your husband or his father offer you any aid or assistance at that time? No. And you had no relatives? None. - And no friends? Just one. She was the only one that helped me. Why didn't you notify your husband? Because I hated him for what he had done. When I needed him most he ran out on me. That is all, Miss Landers. Your witness. Is the child in court? Yes, Your Honor. In the anteroom with the matron. Miss Landers, you are on the stage, are you not? Yes. Have you any other profession or income? No. What is your present salary? Fifteen hundred dollars a week. And last year it was? - Five hundred. In the past two years you have earned approximately $70,000. About that, yes. And out of that $70,000 you have thriftily managed to save .. One hundred and twenty-five thousand. I refer to your trust fund in the First Central Bank. Does this surplus represent donations from .. Gentlemen admirers? Well, if you'll let me explain .. - Answer yes or no, please. Yes. Miss Landers. Two months before your marriage you were accepting similar donations. Outside checks in addition to your salary. Your Honor. I have the proof here. Order. Your husband's discovery of this formed the basis for his divorce suit. A suit which you were wise in not contesting. I didn't want to contest it. - No. Because the notoriety blazed the way for success and wealth. Overnight you were famous. Your salary was raised. Your name went up in electric lights. And later. When your baby was born. You only had about four dollars. Explain that to the court. The rest. The money that I had earned I put in the bank, for the baby. In case something happened to me. You get the baby. You continued to hide him as you feared he may prove a drawback to your career. Not true. He was not permitted to live with you. To appear with you in public. You suppressed every iota of information pertaining to his existence. You pushed him out of your life. The glamorous, gay life which makes your name a daily asset to the front page .. And the gossip column. And why? Because he was a detriment, wasn't he? He couldn't be. Now let us picture this Broadway life entirely without .. I couldn't live without him! But what if the court should decide to take him from you? How can they? He is mine. Well, isn't that rather a selfish angle? The boy is entitled to the best of care. He's had it. Everything that money could do for him. Money. - And love. All the love in the world. And social background. He's better without it. How do you know? By permitting scandalous divorce proceedings .. You deliberately left the ranks of decent .. I object, Your Honor. I object to this entire line of questioning. Objection overruled. Mr Darrall is endeavouring to prove his client's contention .. That the mother of the child is not a fit person to rear it. Order in the court. That is all, Your Honor. We rest our case. Are there any other witnesses? - No, Your Honor. Order! This court is concerned only with the best interests of the disputed child. In respect to its temperamental and moral welfare. The ordinary procedure with a child of tender years. Is to award it to its mother. However, there are certain elements in this case. Not in accord with the usual order of things. Miss Landers, your life your own to do with as you see fit. This court has no wish to criticise you or the way you live. But where that living may affect the future of a minor child. It becomes a matter for grave consideration. I shall therefore order the child placed in the custody of Mr Robert North. No! You can't do it. - I'm sorry, Miss Landers. You can't do it I tell you! Robert North is not the baby's father. Your Honor, this is a cheap trick. A last desperate attempt on the part of this woman. lt is utterly ridiculous. Miss Landers, let me warn you. If what you just said is not true you have committed perjury. Which is a criminal offence. I swear that Robert North is not the father of my child. 0rder! If Robert North isn't the father of your child, who is? - I can't tell you that. Remember you took a solemn oath to speak the truth and nothing but the truth. Do you admit your previous testimony was a lie? - That isn't what I said. Do you realize there is a severe penalty for perjury? You know you can go to prison for this? Who is the father? You want us to believe it's one of the hundreds of men your name was linked to? Is he one of the men who so kindly donated money to you? Why are you lying? - I'm not lying. Then tell the court the whole truth. What's the name of your child's father? What is it? - Wait. Please. While you think of someone? Who is the man? Name him. You can't! His name is Craig Cutting. Wow, what a statement. This is a very serious matter. You have needlessly stigmatised your child unless you can prove what you say. My proof is a matter of court record. When my husband divorced me 4 years ago he named Craig Cutting as correspondent. Your Honor, my client voluntarily returns the child to its mother. And asks for dismissal of the case. Dismissal granted. Mummy! Oh, my baby. My angel. Don't say anything. I understand. What did I tell you about that thumb? (R0_s)
