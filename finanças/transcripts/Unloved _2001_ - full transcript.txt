A WOWOW Bandai Visual Presentation MORIGUCHI Yoko NAKAMURA Toru MATSUOKA Shunsuke Producer SENTO Takenori Script MANDA Tamami & MANDA Kunitoshi Music KAWAI Kenji Cinematography ASHIZAWA Akiko Lighting KANAZAWA Masao Director MANDA Kunitoshi Taking that test? - You're not? - No. You should. Isn't it awkward for you? With the younger ones going ahead. Not really. Well, I find it awkward. You've been here long, so there's no need to study. I like what I do now. It suits me. What you do now could suit anybody. You do a good job. That's true. But couldn't you be a bit more aggressive? - But that's not what I... - Sir! That's all. Tea, please. I'll do it. Excuse me. Thanks a lot. - This was very well organized. - Not her. The one who was at my desk before. You've met her before, but she doesn't stand out. - Where's Kageyama? - Shall I get her? No, it's okay. Here you are. Ms. Kageyama. The papers were perfect. Thanks. That's okay. See you. That room's empty. I already subscribe. Your face is all wet. Let's try again. Once more. Here you go. Did you drink? You did? Is it good? - Hello, sir. - Hello. Just a moment. Let me do this. How was city hall? Do you expect it will work out? With a few more visits, yes. And the university lab? Things are fine. In a couple more years, this place will be too small. Here you go. I'm meeting Mr. Ito from the bank, but I'll go alone today. I'll just give him a short report. Thank you. When you were staring out the window before, what were you thinking? Nothing really. Facing the future is fine, but not the past. Especially not your ex-wife. It's been a year. You were right in divorcing her. The way you two think and live is so different. It worries me when you stare out the window like that. You've endured a lot to get where you are, including your divorce. I appreciate the work you've put in. Thank you. We women find happiness in seeing a man become somebody. Even if it takes some spanking. Have you spanked, too? My man's bum is rather big. The role of a wife and the role of a woman who comforts men are different. Do you have anyone like that? What? Who is she? Aren't you going to meet her? Wow. Don't be embarrassed. Have more confidence. She understands her position. I won't keep you any longer. I'll stay here for a while. Good-bye. Ms. Kageyama. I've been waiting. Can I buy you a coffee? I have a bicycle. It's okay. Somewhere close. Ms. Kageyama. Will you work for me? Mr. Goto said that you don't stand out. That you're unfriendly. It's rude. I think you're actually a more talented person. If I can continue what I do now, I'm fine with that. Don't you want to try your capabilities? Be recognized by others? Not by doing things that don't suit me. What I do now is suitable for me. Not just my job, but who I am now suits me. I wonder if you understand. Anybody needs courage to try new things. - That's not what I mean. - Don't be afraid of failure. I understand your point. But that's not it. If people want to label me, they can go ahead. I don't have to peel it off. I'm just acting naturally. At your age... I'm sorry, but I heard you're over 30... Chances will become scarce. Chances? Yes, chances. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by chances. Your age, your lifestyle... I'm fine the way I am. But... Isn't that sad? I'm not sad. You're honest with yourself. Thank you. But I haven't given up. I'd like you to be at my side. Can we meet again? Sure. Great. - What's the rent? - 60,000 yen. No way! - It's so far from the station. - Yeah. A neighbor? Yeah, today's the last time. Yeah. Go ahead. That's taken care of. I'm not coming here anymore. We're free to go ahead with it. I see. That's for tomorrow. See you. You heard? From Mr. Goto. The girls are disappointed. I won't be coming here anymore. Want to come over? It's close. - Your order? - Coffee, please. Here. Upstairs. It's cozy inside. Downstairs? That guitar. Yeah. - Heard me, maybe. - No way. The city hall pays well, right? So-so. I've been there long. Why? Why don't you live better? I like it here. This is funny. It's a short walk. Welcome. We've been expecting you. Hi. Need your help. Take this. Welcome. - Which one shall we try first? - Up to you. This way, please. Try those on. Well? - It's strange. - No, it isn't. Shall we try the other one? Yes. Oh, I like that. Can she wear that? Leave that on. And now we need a coat. 439,000 yen. Welcome. We've been expecting you. I'll take your coat. Excuse me. This way. Welcome. Enjoy your dinner. Shall I order for you? Excuse me. Sorry. I have to go. An important client... Work? I'll be back soon, so start without me. Have you decided? Well... I'm leaving. What's wrong? I want to return this. What about dinner? - I ate elsewhere. - What? I want to return this. What do you mean? I want my clothes back. Give me a break, it was work. That's not it. I want to change. Come to my place. Don't. Stop acting like a kid. I didn't want to leave. I couldn't help it. Can't you be angry some other way? I'm not angry. Then why do you want to change? Why did you eat somewhere else? I didn't want to sit alone in that outfit. That dress didn't suit me, and that place didn't feel right. And I'm sorry I left you alone. That's not it. It was just uncomfortable. It might be at first but you'd soon get used to it. That's why I took you. It's no big deal. The clothes, too. Even if it's natural for you, it was very uncomfortable for me. It would be worse if you wore that there. That's true. I apologize for not asking you first, but I thought you'd like it. Most women would, I guess. Why be so stubborn? Why not just enjoy it? I'm being honest. That dress and that restaurant really don't suit me. They could never be normal for me. Why can't I expect you to adjust? If I could do it naturally, I would, but... You're mad I forced you. I'm not angry. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I suppose. Are you hungry? Have you eaten? No. I'll make something. It's empty anyway. Aren't you staying? I start early tomorrow. I'll see you home. No, I'll be okay. Here. You looked great in it. Awake? You slept well. That ceiling is the same as home. Home? It's a sweets shop in the same city. That's why you like it here. Hey. Could I came here at night? When? Always. From work. That's impossible. Maybe not always, but often. I don't have a computer or a fax. Just buy them. You could use it, too. There's no space. Really? We could move this shelf. Or maybe we could move. Let's do that. I can move out and sell my place. We could look for furniture together. The kitchens in the new places are cool. That echoes next door. So let's find some place that won't echo. Some place where? Wherever. Near your new company? Wherever. I don't want to. I want to be with you. Let's go on a trip. I can manage one night. Wherever you want to go. Okay. Closed from December to March It's closed until spring. I've rushed you. Was I too pushy? I'm like this at work. I have to be to survive. It's become a habit. But I won't rush anymore. We can try it your way. Let's build a life together. It's not because you rushed me. Or because you were pushy. Our positions are too different. So let's take time and change that. I'll stand by you. You know what? That apartment, and these clothes, I never once thought them embarrassing. You're the one who thinks so. So you want to change me. You expect me to live like you do. You expect that would make me happy. You think that... all women like me would. I never... I've never once been envious of your lifestyle. I don't want it. I don't care how others see me, I like my life. This is where I should be. Is it cowardice to cherish that? A lack of courage? You needn't give up your life. I want us to build a new life together. A life dependent of you? Where I have to adjust to your ways? That's not true. Then... can you live like I do? Can you live with me in that apartment? Can you give up your lifestyle to be with me? And still be happy? You couldn't. You have work. A reputation. I'm not saying that's bad. That's just where you belong. Time will never change that. The day when you suggested... we move in together, I knew then that it was over. "Over"? What is? I can't see you anymore. Why are you saying this? You wanted to tell me that? That's why you came. Yes. That'll be 1,549 yen. I'm a little short. I'll be right back. I need 300 yen. Got any change? From 1,600 yen, then. You ate out? Here. Hey. This is wrong. Answer that. The door! Fill this out, please. Hey. I can't go. Don't send these to me. Here. I got tons from home. Well... Thanks. I'll peel them? The apples. Peel them? No, thanks. The skin's nutritious, but it's not very good. It's okay. Right. I didn't thank you properly. I was being pushy, wasn't I? It's strange. They were good. There's going to be a gig. Day after tomorrow. Are you playing? My friend. You want to come? How much? It's okay. Thanks. Your friend's pretty good. He wants to be a pro. I hear you play, too. The guitar. I'm... Not very good. Want to ride double? - But we're almost home. - Let's go around. I'm not sure. Never done it before. Not good at bikes, either? Let's buy decent things at a decent store, and cook a decent meal someday. Water them. Where's a decent store? The market by the station. That? It's actually pretty decent. Well? What's wrong? I'm just... Really happy. Where's Ms. Kageyama? She'll be here... Oh. Can I wait inside? I'll go then. It's raining. Let's wait together. Okay? Please. Hey. What's your name? Shimokawa. What Shimokawa? Hiroshi. You use the character "ocean" for that? No, the other one. With "bow" in it. With "bow" on the left. Oh, I see. How old? My age? - Yeah. - 28. What do you do? Right now? Your job. Delivery service. - You deliver? - I do the sorting. No license. You don't need a license? I just sort. Been there long? Three years. Started after college? High school. Actually I'm staff. Well, contract. What? At the company. Been in Tokyo long? After high school. Where do you live? Nearby? Downstairs. What? Oh, I see. So you were playing the guitar. You play in a band? - I'm leaving. - Why don't you ask about me? Aren't you interested? Not really. - I'm going. - No. Stay. What do you want? Why did you barge in like this? I'm fine! Hey, could you excuse us? - I want to talk to her. - There's nothing... It's okay. I'll go. Did you leave me for him? I met him after I left you. He lives downstairs. You knew him... while you were with me. Leave him out of this. All along, it was just about him. That's not true. Same thing. When I'm with him, I can be myself. I don't have to worry about my feelings or his. - He's different from you. - Stop. I never felt like this before. Then why did you date me? Why go over that again? You expected something from me, didn't you? I've never thought about it. You don't fall in love with reason. It didn't have to be me? - Anyone would have done? - I never said that. But you're with that... Stop saying that. Then why? You asked me out. I had no reason to say no. Isn't that enough? So that's it? There's no reason to like, but there is to dislike? Words turn everything into a lie. - I can't explain. - You're being selfish. - I want to stay honest. - If you do, then say it. Afraid of making a slip? You're running away. I've never run away. If you stay with him, you'll be ruined. I want to save you. Oh, stop it. I don't get it. Why is he suited to you? I don't have to tell you. Is it easy being with him? Because you don't have to think? That's not how it should be. Is it? Are you making fun of me? I didn't ask you to come. Can't you understand? Understand what? My feelings. You're not sorry. You liked me, right? So you dated me. Then shouldn't you be... apologizing to me? You want to, don't you? Inside, you feel sorry. Why can't you be honest? There's nothing to apologize for. You could lie. I'd feel better if you did. There's no point in lying. You just got tired of me and went to that younger guy. Pretending not to realize. Mr. Katsuno. Do you always look down on those you spend time with? Is that the way you love? Is that your pride? Is this how you divorced your wife? You let go because she apologized? Good-bye. If you were curious, why leave? Don't eavesdrop from downstairs. If you're okay... Hold on. What about dinner? I'll cook. Hello? It's me. Huh? It's Eiji. Sorry to surprise you. You sure did. It only takes a year to forget a voice. So? What is it? I... What? What's wrong? Was it because I couldn't let go of my pride? Did I look down upon you? So you've finally realized. What should I do? Tell me. It's too late. Good-bye. Don't call me anymore. - Try harder, then. - You should be trying. No. No. Sorry to keep you waiting. Is it raining? Not yet. I'm not going today. Why not? I'm tired. - You sure? - Yeah. Call in sick, then. You wearing that? Isn't there anything else? Call the office, okay? See you. Employment Information Okay. Set the table. You think I could work in TV? I don't know. Probably not. Why? Well, is it what you really want? What would you do then? What do you mean? What do you want to be? I want to be somebody. Don't you? Not really. You think so... Don't read while we're eating. Why? Just don't. You want to live somewhere bigger? Now we're wasting one apartment. This place is fine. And you just moved here. Go home at night, then. It's raining. Are you asleep? What? Well... That guy... Nothing. It's stopped. I'm taking the week off. Why? Going in is a waste of time. What are you saying? Take today off. Let's go somewhere. Don't be unreasonable. So what about today? I'm staying. Then clean the room, okay. Do yours while you're at it. Who is the man of my dreams? Age: 29 Job: Businessman at a Foreign Firm Yearly Income: 6,000,000 yen. Hey. Let's go out to eat. - Eat what? - Something. Let's stay home. It's more relaxing that way. Reduced price We're going to eat it today. Let's go eat something good. Forget it. What, then? I'll go by myself. Come downstairs. Come on. What do you want? - Sleep here for a change. - Why? Change of scenery. What are you saying? If you have something to say, say it. Don't take it out on me. I'm quitting. Quitting your job? Yeah. And then what? I'll find some other job. What other job? Some foreign-owned firm. Why? My job now won't get me anywhere. You really think a foreign firm will hire you? I'll study. Study what? I want to try something. But you can't. I don't know that. Is it wrong to try? No, but it doesn't suit you. I want to live better. Don't you? My life now is fine. - Are you fine with me? - Sure. - Even if I'm so poor? - Sure. - Even if I'm a loser? - Don't say things like that. You might be fine, but I'm not. Then go do what you want. But don't be envious of others when you can't do anything. Why do you talk like that? Here I am motivated and not a word of encouragement. I just said to do what you want! Forget it. I get it. Water them. They're dying. Can I talk to you? Let me hand it to you inside. - Wait a sec. - Okay. Can you do it today? You want me to, right? Yes. I can do it. Probably. Sorry to trouble you. Excuse me. - She works for you? - Yeah. Was it all right? What? Nothing. Oh. Don't know. Maybe she expected something. How much is this place? How old are you? Your age. 38. What do you do? Graduate of Tokyo University? You're from Tokyo? - From a good family... - Cut it out. - Stop. - I'm from a farming family in Okayama. I graduated from an industrial high school. All right. Stop it. Why did Mitsuko choose me instead of you? Why did she dump someone who lives a good life like you? Ask her. If I did, would she tell me? - Would she? - How should I know. Why don't you go now? Then why did you let me in? You were in control before. Not working out, huh? - What? - You two. We're doing great. It makes no difference to me. I don't believe you. You don't have to. Now get out. What do you want? Why did you come? Just wondering how you're doing. What's so funny? Nothing. You just laughed. So you're the person... she was looking for. That's a laugh. I may not have a driver's license, but I do have one for welding. My first job in Tokyo was as a welder. I welded everything. Bolts and pipes. I've built buildings like this. With the walls, it's no big deal, but without them, the height's terryfing at first. You fasten safety belts around your waist. You want to see the scar? The pay was bad. I couldn't stand it. Stop it. Aren't you ashamed? No. Because she came to me. Not to you, but to me. Yeah. And I'm glad she did. If she can stand you, then she's clearly not worth my time. I get it now. So that woman here just now, that stuck-up university graduate is your type? Possibly. But one thing's for sure, she's not your type. You live in different worlds. You're really unhappy. No. Thanks to you, I'm very happy. Because you can despise us? Divert your mind from your loss? So you can despise Mitsuko and forget her? You're just protecting yourself. What about you? - I'm happy. I have Mitsuko. - She's all you need? Sure. Then why did you show up? What do you want? - I told you... - You're pathetic. You want me to admit my loss. She's the only thing you have. That's the best you can do. You envy me. My way of life. - Shut up. - You're insecure. Not sure why she choose a welder from Okayama instead of me. - You want to live like I do. - No I don't! Read this and study. You must know something about computers. When you finish, come to my company. I'll hire you based on the interview. Shimokawa. I lied about the interview. You didn't actually think I'd hire you? Keep the books. As a souvenir. You think I'm a fool. You're disgusted with me. I never said that. Visiting that guy and accepting these books, hoping... You think I'm pretty low. No, I don't. Then what? Pity? I'm tired of this miserable lifestyle. I want out of this life. I've always wanted to. But you interfere. A shabby woman like you drags me down. It's not my fault. It's because you met him. You envy his lifestyle. You're jealous of him. I just want a decent lifestyle. Isn't what we have decent? What, this run-down place? You expect me to stay forever. Where people live, and what people think, things like that doesn't matter. You're laughed at because you envy people from insecurity. That's why he laughed at you. He's your problem, not mine. I don't care how he sees me. But the way you see me matters. Why do you compare yourself with him? Don't you think it's stupid? You compared us, didn't you? - Even now. - I've never compared you. Then why is it me, not him? When I first met you, when I asked you for change, I never thought I could do such a thing. But I did. I knew it would be okay with you. You were someone content with your life. That's why I choose you. I was shaking then. I met someone I could really trust. I couldn't believe it could happen. We're okay the way we are. It's the only way to be. You're trying to do something you can't. Although you know it. Mr. Katsuno might be able to, but you can't pretend to be him. You don't have to. I think Mr. Katsuno is being honest with himself. I want to be, too. That's why we broke up. I want you to be honest with yourself. Vanity doesn't solve anything. I'm almost 30. - It's almost too late. - Age doesn't matter. Don't be misled. How can you be so confident? I was jealous of him. I envied him. Isn't that normal? Anyone would compare him and me. And think he's better. You've thought so, too. Never compared us two? That's unnatural. You're lying. - I'm not. - Sure you are. You're being vain, too. You're miserable for being over 30 and a nobody. You don't want to hear it. You want to think otherwise. I'm not being vain. Vanity isn't bad. It's a typical human trait. And I'm just a typical loser. That's not the point. It's nobodys fault we're where we are. That's just who we are. Why be embarrassed about who you are? Why are you so vain? Who cares about lifestyles that people envy? It's more important to be who you are. Even if you can't have anything else, you can't let go of that. You know that, don't you? Don't pull me into your circle. You forced your way into my life. I was just dragged along with you. I'm a man, too. I want to date like other guys. Is that being envious? You can say so. Because you're right. - But you can't accuse me. - Nobody's accusing you. I just want to realize. You've never thought about how I feel. Of course I have. Then why do you try to hinder me? If you understand me, you could be more encouraging, you know. You could give in, and agree with me. Couples do that, right? I can't. That's wrong. You just care about yourself. It hurts to be with you. He's not the one hurting me, you are. Am I the only one wrong? Are you always right? You've never been wrong? Why are you trying to make a wrong or a right? It's normal to think differently. It's okay to fight over differences. Must you think like the other? It's better to be able to say what you want than to wonder what the other is thinking. Otherwise, why be together? You say "encouragement" but you just want to be spoiled. - You don't love me. - I do. Then why are we arguing? I love you. But not the way you want me to. Forget it. I understand. No, you don't. I hate you. It's your fault. I don't want to go. But it's too late. No, it's not! Be who you used to be again. I'm not saying this from contempt. Even if we argue, my wanting to be with you doesn't change. It's you I want to be with. Don't let words deceive you. It's too late. You're trying to run away from yourself, too. I've had enough! Don't run now. If you do, you're just a coward. Hating me won't solve anything. You're not giving up, are you? Acting tough. I'm not tough. - I just want you to understand. - I don't. - We've fallen apart. - That's not true. Admit your weakness. There's no other way. I can't recover. So I should apologize. Is that it? If you think so, then do it. Even if I'd be lying? You'd stay if I apologize? Then being together would become meaningless. You love yourself too much. No one can stay with you that way. So that's it? You're okay. Of course I'm not! This is the only way I can be. This is who I am. But you're the only one for me. Even if you leave, my feelings for you won't change. Even if I wind up alone, I'll always care about you. Nobody will ever love you. That's who you are. I'm staying here. This time, I choose you.
