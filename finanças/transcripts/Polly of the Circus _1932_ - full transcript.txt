Hey you, there's a law in this town against posters of women without any clothes on. Say, these are the regular circus posters and we're paying for the billboard. Well, in this town they either come down or you got to cover them up. We'll see about that. - Hello kiddies. - Hello Polly. Boys, this is too much but I thank you. Excuse me and I was thinking that that cup of java is for the wife. Well, come back and buy another. Turn on the jazz Herbie. I got to have action this morning. - Hello Beef. - Hey... - Come on Eric, let's dance. - Not me, I'm too much losing. Oh, you haven't got a chance, they know you're bluffing. Throw away your Jack and draw to the Ace. So, this is Oronta. - For the love of Mike, look. - What's that? A Princess Eugenie skirt? Somebody is got wise to that dame's figure at last. Hey Beef, look out the window and grab yourself a belly laugh. Look it, pants. Maybe the next one will have corsets. They're certainly billing you strong in this town Polly. Sure, Reno the boss bill poster, wise guy. He knows what brings the shekels into the ticket wagon. And if I do say so, I shouldn't. What nature gave Mademoiselle Polly doesn't do any billboard a bit of harm. What's that? - For the love of? Beef, I'm wearing... - Pants. Is that supposed to be news? - It ain't pants. - They're panties. Looks like real lace. - Somebody is trying to make a sap out of me. - Somebody is been peeping in your trunk. Say, look. - Polly, who's your boyfriend? - Shut up, runt. I'm going to find out who did it. And what I'll tell that goat legged, long bearded, blue nosed, hot head old fossil... will be more than you can put in your old man's hat. - A knock on the chin for him. - On the chin? Alright. What is this? A wrestling match? - Mister mister Hartley? - Yes Downey? Your uncle, the Bishop is upstairs. - Well, ask him come down. - Very well. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, you big gorilla. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah and I'll put those right there Benny. Ah, there you are, just drove in to say goodbye John. I'm going for my train now. Goodbye uncle James. What's the matter boy? You seem worried. - What say uncle? - Anything wrong? Oh, not a thing, not a thing. You're a confounded young liar, out with it. - Well, Uncle James, I... - Anything I can do? Well, well, with you my Bishop it's a, it's a little awkward. Here, read this telegram. It's a call from St. Peter's in Southbury. - Splendid John, a great compliment. - Thank you sir. I want to accept the call. Leave this church and my diocese? Well, I want to stand on my own feet uncle James. You're my nephew John, so it's only natural that I should want to help you. Stay here my boy, and let me prompt and guide you. With my help, you'll go further in the church than I've gone. And someday, these old eyes of mine will see you a Bishop. Hey you, where's the preacher? - In the vestry room. - Vestry? Can I go in? Or do I have to wait until he puts on his vest? - He's busy now, you'll have to wait. - Who says so? Pardon me, but if you ain't too busy I'd like to have a few words with you. Well, I'm in rather a hurry, but if it's important? It's plenty important, you're reverend Hartley, ain't you? - I am not. - I'm the Reverend Hartley. - You mean that you? Are you the preacher? - I'm the rector of this church. - So, is there anything I can do for you? - Yes, there's something I just got to know. - You tell me the truth, won't you? - Of course, what is it? It's the stork that brings the little new babies to the mamas, ain't it? - That's one theory, there's another. - And there's something else. I want to know who elected you inspector of what women ought to wear and why. What's this young woman? Thunder my train, quick my boy, my coat, my hat. Here, Uncle James. I won't stay to put them on, trains don't wait. Goodbye my boy, see you in about six weeks time, eh? Goodbye, Uncle James. - Now then young lady, who are you? - I'm Mademoiselle Polly of the circus. Say, what do you mean by pasting dinky little aprons and pantalets all over my billing? What makes you think it was I? You're head of the city beautiful league, ain't you? - Yes. - So you know what's beautiful, eh? I've been four years with this circus and nobody is complained about my figure yet. No? I'm not complaining either. I suppose you think I ought to work in a middy blouse and a couple of petticoats. Did you ever see a trapeze act? I haven't missed a circus since the summer I had the whooping cough. Well, tights are my uniform. And it burns me up to have anyone like you tell me how I ought to dress. Tights are alright in circuses, this is a conservative town. - People have different viewpoints. - Having viewpoints is alright. But putting paper bloomers on them is an insult. You know, I thought it was rather cute, after all it's a matter of taste. - Taste? Tripe, it's my figure, ain't it? - It's their town, ain't it? Yes, ain't, ain't, ain't. Now I don't even talk to suit you. Yes, go on and grin. This is just a joke to you. You know, you're going to be late for your matinee. Say, are you trying to kid me? Now that it's all over I'll tell you a thing. I had nothing whatever to do with disfiguring your posters. There's a law in this town against certain forms of advertising. And it was your own bill poster who stuck on the pantalets. What? On your way out, would you mind telling the old lad out there not to let anyone else in? - What's the trouble here? - Oh, go take a running jump at yourself. - How is it coming Billy? - Well. - Here comes Polly. - Oh, she's hot those pants. Say, listen Peewee, that pants business is out. And didn't I knock them off the blues? Say Polly, do you know they recognized you when they saw the elephant's south end? - Why, you little runt, I'll... - Oh, don't get sore about it. Excuse me, Oh, it's Polly. I didn't know you with your pants off. Well, if I had legs like yours, I'd be glad to wear pants. Ladies and gentlemen... you're about to witness, the most spectacular... the most hazardous and the most breathtaking performance... ever attempted on the flying trapeze. I take great pleasure in introducing, the charming... and lovely young lady mademoiselle Polly. Her two fearless partners... Don and Eric Alvarez. This little lady has thrilled countless thousands with her daring. This hazardous feat... will be performed 50 feet in midair. Fifty feet above the ground without a net. I'm all burned up. Oh, come on Polly, snap out of the trance or you won't make it. If I'm supposed to make it, I'll make it. Go on, peddle your fish. Ok. Well, see you later. Hey Polly, where's your pants? Come on, give us some music, quick, quick. - Somebody call an ambulance. - Hospital is miles away. My house is just up the street, better take her there. - That's mighty good of you father. - Bring her right over, I'll run ahead. - Give me those blankets. - Here, put that on her. Downey, get the spare room ready, they're bringing a girl from the circus here. - In here? - Yes. - Don't let them do it Mr. Hartley. - Now, don't waste time talking. All day long I've watched those circus women pointing at this house and grinning. I tell you, it's a trick. A trick? The girl fell 50 feet, you're talking like a fool. I spent 8 long years in jail because I pitied a woman and took her into my house once. Look out for the steps. Listen now, don't, don't break step, it joggles her. - Which room father? - That door there. Pardon me. - Good evening John. - Right this way doctor. - A basin of hot water. - Get it Downey. Can you see anything? Thank you. Out, out. Hurry and get out, all of you, close that door. Dust blowing in here, settling all over the house. Come on, this is no place for children. Children? What you mean, you big goof? I got a son bigger than you are. - Get out, this is the minister's house. - Yeah, minister? - That's enough Half-pint. - It was them posters. A hick in the blues made some crack about them... and Polly lost her head and took off at the wrong time. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. - A fine time to be sorry now. For a plugged nickel, why I, I... - Outside and cool off, everybody outside. - Let me go, will you? I assure you old man, that no one intended to humiliate the girl. No use worrying about what's already done father. There's an old circus saying... you can't make any money hanging around the town you played last night. Go on to your next stand. - John? - Yes doctor. Fracture, the right fibula. Bruises and shaken up considerably. Possible internal injury. Gangway, gangway. - Hello Dr. Brownell, where's the case? - Sorry to have called you Tom. - Moving the girl is out of the question. - Alright Pete, let's go. How long she have to be here doctor? - Maybe three weeks. - Three weeks? Maybe six, who knows? - Will that be alright with you father? - Yes. Of course, I don't have to tell you there's plenty of money. - No please. - Thanks father. I guess I'll be going, I'll be back when the wagons are loaded. I've known her ever since she was a kid that high. I used to hold her in my arms while her mother was in the ring doing her act. What he say Beef? How long is she going to be here? - How is she? - First she's up and then down. If you don't mind watching her a bit I'll go out to the kitchen and heat her milk. - Heat her milk? - Oh, yes. Doctor's orders, everything the patient eats has to be heated. - How are you feeling? - How do you expect? I came in as soon as the doctor would let me. Well, how are you? Not that I care a hoot, but just to keep the conversation going. - I'm very well, thank you. - That's too bad. I want to tell you how sorry I am about the accident. That makes it unanimous. From what I can make out you think I'm a good deal to blame. I suppose you expect me to say, not at all old chap, not at all. No, I don't. - I brought you some reading matter. - I know, the Bible. - Wrong, not the Bible. - The Bible hasn't any pictures in it. Oh yes, it has. And if it hasn't enough maybe I can find you a tabloid edition. There you are. See the pretty pictures? Say, who's that? One of the pallbearers? You better let it go till tomorrow Downey. If I don't keep ahead of the dust it dries up my throat. Starts me wanting to drink. Oh, let him dust his head off, it's nothing to me. - Better go now Downey. - Oh, alright. If I'm in the way, I'll go. You're a little feverish, I'll call Mrs. Jennings. - I want to sit up. - Lie down please. - And try and get a little sleep. - Oh, don't paw me. You're one of those fellas that has to put your hands all over a girl? Listen young lady... I don't know or care whether you're a girl or, or an Egyptian mummy. Oh, yeah? I guess you ain't so different from other men. No, probably not. Nor do all other men find it impossible to keep their minds off that sort of thing. Keeping your mind off women is like learning to pitch horseshoes by mail. You know how it's done, but can you do it? - Mrs. Jennings? - Coming sir. You better take your patient's temperature. She's quite hot. - Sure, still burning up over the bloomers. - Bloomers? - Say reverend, where's the reading matter? - Reading matter? - Hymn books, I'll bet. - Oh, no. No, books with pictures, eminently suited to your taste. You know, at that, the Bible has some love stories that are much more interesting. Interesting maybe, but they're not so hot. It depends on what you call hot. Good night. Interesting love stories, eh? I don't believe it, give me that Bible. Sure, hot stuff. There you are. Smell good, first fresh air I've had in weeks. Yes, must make you homesick for that dear old smell of the circus. Then sit down and soothe me. Come on reverend, visit with the sick and injured. Oh, I'm due at the church, a wedding rehearsal. Do you really allow people to get married in your church? Oh, yes, yes. I quite approve of marriage. Oh, I might even go so far as to get married myself someday. Oh, what a break for the girl. All your wife would've to do would be learn her catechism... and you give her a big fat kiss every ash Wednesday. My wife will probably be as happy as most wives. Well, I suppose even a minister has his moments. But of course, she'd have to sleep in the woodshed during lent. Well, that's something, I didn't think there was a good laugh in you. Do you always wanted to be a minister? When did you feel it coming on? In college. When you were in college, were you like the rest of the boys? - Sure, more or less. - Did you ever do anything wrong? For instance, didn't you ever, didn't you ever break the 5th commandment? Certainly not. Alright, alright, it has happened, you know. College boys sometimes lose their heads. Yes, well, even that doesn't excuse ingratitude. Ingratitude? Hey... - What is the fifth commandment anyway? - Honor thy father and thy mother. Well, I'll soon be out of a job. Oh, a nurse's life is queer. Half the time, they're hoping their patients will get well... but they don't want to lose their patient. And the other half, they're hoping they won't, they don't want to lose their job. - Oh, I'm going and get ready for your rub. - Thanks Mrs. Jennings. Why you're all dressed up for? Ain't Sunday. Well, I got to keep covered even if it ain't Sunday. Isn't Sunday, I mean. - Trying to make a hit with him, eh? - Oh, go tend to your knitting. The minister doesn't mean a thing to me. Say, you've been here going on two months now. When you going back to that circus? You expect me to do my trapeze act in a wheelchair? Time is out of your wheelchair. Now, you better look out or you'll be like a woman I knew. - Used to go around in one of them things. - Oh, go away, I tell you. When she tried to walk, she couldn't. She'd been in that chair so long her hips was petrified. Hey, what are you trying to do? Put the Indian sign on me? You better look out, because I see trouble coming. - Oh Mr.Hartley? - Good morning Polly. Don't tell me the church had a special matinee Saturday morning. - No, I'm going to meet the parish treasurer. - Where? In the vestry or the coterie or the pantry? In the vestry room. I have a Grant work to show the Bishop tomorrow. Oh, your uncle, I met him the first day, don't you remember? Yes, he's a grand old man. - I really have to go, I'm late. - You're a fine minister. Haven't got time to keep a girl from taking her first full step. What? Will you stop kidding? Well, the doctor said I could try to move today, so I thought you might help me. Hold on there, take it easy. Well, if you're going to help a girl, help her. Well, if you don't mind Mrs. Jennings will be right back, I, I really must go. Well, if she lets me fall down it won't be on my responsibility. You know you're not strong enough yet. You mean, you're not strong enough to hold me up. - Oh, no? - Maybe with two arms. - There, that's better, isn't it? - If it's more comfortable for you. - Well, is it more comfortable for you? - No inconvenience at all. - Mr. Hartley Mr.Hartley. - Yes, what is it Downey? - He's waiting. - Who? Mr. Stevens and he's mad at being kept waiting. Oh yes. Here, take her. - Fixed you that time, didn't I? - Go away, nut. Might as well make up your mind, you'll never get him. Your hips is petrifying, I could feel them. For Pete's sake, where have you been? It's nearly 2 o'clock, I've been frightened stiff. - When did you last see Downey? - - Not since dinner. I've been looking for him, the police warned he was on the loose, drinking again. - Downey is about 30 cents shy, isn't he? - Yes, a little. He used to work for my father. Started drinking, got mixed up with some women and did a jail sentence. Oh, don't worry about him, he'll come home. Why, your feet are wet. Upstairs and take those shoes off. Alright. I wonder if Mrs. Jennings could get me some coffee and a sandwich. I haven't any dinner. - I'll see. - Thanks. - Hi Mr. Hartley. - Come in. Here's a nice, hot supper for you Mr. Hartley. I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour Mrs. Jennings, I... Oh. Where's Mrs. Jennings? I just had a telegraph dispatch from my daughter in New York... - who's Mrs. Harry Hopper. - Something wrong? You'll be happy to hear Miss Brown that she's going to have a baby. - Oh, that's great. - That I'm taking the 8:30 to New York. That explains Downey. He must've got his start on your medicinal Brandy. And as a result, you're all alone in the house with a circus girl. Who should be asleep. I'm sorry I disturbed you. Oh, I wasn't asleep. Afraid you miss your train tomorrow morning? This morning. This morning? Then it's your last few hours in the old house. And I'll miss it. - I'll miss you too Polly. - Will you? Oh, but I can't blame you for wanting to get away now that you're well again. Polly, I let you walk up and down stairs carrying food for me. Oh, I'm alright. I'll have to walk by myself from now on, want to see? Look. You alright? Just let me sit down for a second. - There you are. - Thanks. It's been wonderful being here. It's been nice having you here Polly. And the little circus girl you've been so good to won't forget you... and the things you taught her. Haven't you noticed I ain't saying ain't anymore? Not for weeks. I'll always remember you as I see you there now. With the firelight on your face. And I'll read the Bible every day. The hot stuff? I was reading the Book of Ruth this afternoon. A beautiful story. The story of a mother and her dead son's wife. Well, not the part, I mean. I mean, where it says... Entreat me not to leave thee or to, to... To return from following after thee. Wouldn't it be a shame to waste this on a mother in law? Listen... For whither thou goest, I will go. And where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people and thy God my God. That could be a girl telling a man she give up everything she had just to be with him... couldn't it? Where thou diest, will I die. And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me and more also... if ought but death, part thee and me. Polly, could you say that and mean it? Yes, are you blind John? - I can walk John. - You've walked enough for one day. You know when I first found out I was going to love you? - When? - The day you carried me out on the porch. My heart went bumpety-bumpety-bump. Didn't your heart give even one little bumpety-bumpety-bump? It gave a lot of them but I thought it was indigestion.. No more, I won't get enough sleep tonight as it is. - Goodnight sweetie. - Good night. Jezebel is triumphed, this is a house of sin. You couldn't wait, could you? The first night you're alone in the house you went straight to his room. - Downey, you're full of hooch, get out. - I'm going to put you out of here. - Keep away Downey, keep away. - I know your sinful ways. - John John. - Oh, no, you don't, calling John. What in heaven's name is the matter with you Downey? Have you lost your senses? - Did he hurt you? - Yeah. The way I hurt her is just too bad. Downey, I've had about as much of you as any man can stand. Get out of this house. Alright, I'll go. But this woman has got you. She looks soft, but she ain't. She's got the strength of 10 men. - Get out. - Oh, let it go John. I've been in the circus, I'm use to freaks. You better go to bed John. It would never do for a future Bishop to have circles under his eyes. Good night. - Good morning dear. - Good morning. - Where you going so early? - To meet my uncle at the station. The Bishop? I hope he doesn't remember what I said the first time we met. Suppose he doesn't like me? Of course he'll like you, how could he help it? You say it easily, but you're just as nervous as I am. - I'm not in the least bit nervous. - What you looking for? - My hat. - It's in your hand. I'm glad you're not nervous. - You're sweet. - Hold me tight, never let me go. I'm so happy, I'm afraid. I'll never let anything happen Polly. 8:30, I'll have to hurry. Uncle James and I will have breakfast at the hotel... and then go on to the church from there. I hope your sermon goes over big. Are you coming to hear it? When you hear that loud burst of applause and three cheers, will be me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Dust, dust everywhere. How are you Polly? Women, women everywhere. Dust and women in the houses. Even in the church. - Hey Downey, snap out of it. - I've got to finish my work. - But this is Sunday, come on. - That's the trouble. I stop work on Sunday, but the dust goes right ahead. - Come on, you can dust after the service. - Alright Mr. Donovich. - What are you doing here? - Come on Downey. No, I've as much right here as she has. Look at her, with a face like an angel. But she didn't look like that at 4 o'clock this morning in John Hartley's bedroom. Amen. The Lord is in his holy temple and all the earth keep silence before him. Let us humbly confess our sins unto almighty god. Almighty and most merciful God... we've erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We've followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We've offended against thy holy laws. We've left undone those things which we ought to have done. And we've done those things which we ought not to have done and there's no health in us. Sorry I walked out on you John, but I couldn't stand it. Polly, you remember my uncle, Bishop Northcott? Oh, how do you do? I've often heard John Mr.Hartley, speak of you. Awfully hot for this time of year, isn't it? No. I guess lunch is ready by now, I imagine you're hungry. - No. - Well, I'll say this for you... you can bring a conversation to a full stop quicker than anybody I ever saw. What's wrong? I suppose you believe what Downey said. What he said is true, isn't it? Well, I was in John's room, but is that a crime? I've explained it all Polly, he understand there's nothing wrong. My child, I think it would be better for both of you if you were to go away. What do you mean? Hey, what have you got against me, anyway? I've nothing against you at all... except that you're in a fair way to wreck that boy's future and your own. How? Do you think you've had the sort of training that John's wife should've? I didn't suppose a girl had to be trained to be anybody's wife. I thought you just married them and got your training after. You're as unsuited to be the wife of a minister... as he is to be the husband of a circus performer. Just a moment sir, you're going a bit too far. Never mind John. I don't want to come between you and your people. Suppose I go upstairs and let you decide? But that doesn't mean I want to give him up. Wait Polly. We're excited now sir. Suppose you and I talk the matter over later? There's nothing to talk over John. The parish will never accept this woman as your wife. The vestry will remove you. If they decide to remove me, then it'll have to be that way. Nothing is going to come between Polly and me. As you say John. - Oh John, I'm sorry I... - Don't worry Polly. The first day you came into my life... I declined an offer for a much bigger church in Southbury. Yesterday Jimmy Adams phoned they still wanted me. So, you see darling, you bring me luck. - I'll never get it straight John. - Oh yes, you will, you're just nervous. Let's try again. Now, we're up to the point where the minister says, any man can show just cause... why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak. I do. You don't, you don't say anything there. When you do say something, is I will, not I do. Oh, yes, of course. Then the minister says John Hartley... wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife... - And so and so. - I will. No, Polly, no. But John, you just this minute told me to say I will. - I answer that. - My mistake, go ahead. Pauline Brown, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband... Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor... and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others... keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live? John, did you see it? That beautiful little bungalow. Polly, you haven't paid the least bit of attention to anything I've been saying. Oh, I'm sorry John. Alright, go ahead. And the minister says... Who giveth this woman to be married to this man? I do. I think, under the circumstances... we had better ask Mr. Maxwell to postpone his retirement a while longer. If necessary. That must be as you wish of course, good morning gentlemen. John... Don't you see? We can't take side. It'd be just the same as giving the Oronta vestry a slap in the face. Why don't you see your uncle and get him to try to straighten things out? I'm sorry Jimmy, I can't. Oh, don't talk like that, this is a serious matter. It isn't only this church. It's the diocese, any diocese. Don't you see your position? A minister asked to resign on account of scandal... Beg your pardon sir Mrs. Hartley said for you to come to this address. Oh yes, of course. - Thank you. - Yes sir. Think it over John. We'll wait a few days before selecting anybody else. - You see your uncle and... - It's no use Jimmy. That's one quarrel that will never be straightened out now. Goodbye and thanks. - Look at it John, isn't it a honey? - Yes, it's lovely. All you have to do is to go down and sign the lease and pay the first month's rent. Then we can move right in. Wait John, isn't there something in the Bible that says... If thou carry thy bride in over thy threshold she won't walk out on thee. - No. - Then it must've been Shakespeare. - Well, let's do it anyway. - Alright. Home, I never really had a home. Just a bump in the circus car or a room in a theatrical hotel. But this is so wonderful, it... And it's a very select neighborhood too, no dogs, no cats, no children. - No children? - Well, I only took it for a year. Come on. Look at it John, all nice and shiny. Like a, like a string of beads. Look, they're labeled hot and cold, absolutely foolproof. This is the hot... and this is the cold. - Watch out Polly. - That plumber was left-handed. But isn't it grand John? - It's all very nice Polly. - You think there wasn't a tool in the place. But they're all here right under your hand. For instance, suppose you're writing a sermon and you suddenly yell, I got to have a mop. You rush in here, you can't find one. You look at me sternly and say, what, no mop? That's my big moment. I look you calmly in the eye. What's this? I reach over here, press this button the door flies open and.. - Are you hurt? - I guess I pressed the wrong button. It'll give you a rough idea of what I mean. Let's get out of here before I kill myself. And the rent is practically nothing, only $100 a month for a dream house like this. A hundred dollars. And you haven't seen anything yet. The man called this the master's bedroom John. But I thought that maybe the master would let his new wife come into it once in a while. This is the heart of the house. This is where we come when we want to be alone. There'll be tired times and sleepy times. And loving times. Maybe some unhappy times, but it won't make any difference because we'll be together. And wait till you see the view, look John. This is the first thing you see every morning. Our church, the church we were married in. What's the matter John? What's wrong? Polly, I'm afraid we can't take the house. - John. - You see, I didn't get the church. But that isn't fair. Oh well, what difference does it make? There lots of other churches you can get. I don't think so. - You see... - I know, it's your uncle. No, it's just, just circumstances. Oh, forget about it John, don't worry about the future. If we're supposed to make it, we'll make it. Yes, of course, we'll be alright. - I have a little money John. - We won't talk about that Polly. What does it matter? You and I could be happy in a tent. Mrs. Hartley, tis me Mrs. McNamara. Hello Mrs. M. Hello darling, the laundry lad left this with me. It's Mr. Hartley's shirts, I haven't got up the nerve to tackle starched shirts yet. You know, that lad kept ringing the bell till I thought he'd bring down the house. I'm not answering the bell these days, you see... Say no more. Your good man ain't working yet? - No, not yet. - Well, there's many like him. I'm just going to run along up the Avenue after a can of salmon. You know, I had me dinner all cooked before I found out it was Friday. - Goodbye Mrs. M. - Goodbye darling. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello honey. - Hello, sweetie. - What's new? - Well, I was offered a position today. Say no more darling, it's a fine lad you are. - What's the job? - Selling Bibles for a publishing house. Why John, that's practically the same as being back in your pulpit, isn't it? - And say, if you can make $100 a week... - A hundred? Salary is 28 dollars a week. But John, that isn't a salary, it, it's an insult. I only got 1800 a year in Oronta. I don't want to offend you John... but a good barker on the Circus Midway makes twice that much. Oh, it isn't the money. You know, being a minister isn't a business dear. - I love the church. - I see. My training all my life is been toward that goal, to help others. - For 35 dollars a week. - For nothing, if necessary. For the divine privilege of guiding mankind out of unhappiness. Oh, I'm sorry. John, why don't you let me go back to the circus? Absolutely not. Just for the balance of the season? Please? I could make a lot of money in four months. - And I wouldn't spend it this time and... - No, no, no. Let's not even discuss it. Alright sweets, we'll get along somehow. If we're supposed to make it, we'll make it. We won't starve, wait a minute. - I had another lead today. - Really? What is it? A friend of mine in New York... he has an East Side Mission, he said he might need an assistant. John, church again. It's nothing but church, church, church. Can't you forget it and think about me a little? What's the church ever done for you? Paid you starvation wages while you were working for them... and now won't have you at any price. And yet you're always talking church. Well, I'm fed up, I'm sick of it. Alright dear, dinner is ready. Oh honey lamb, don't be mad, I didn't mean what I said. You and I could be happy even if we didn't have a nickel. John... John... John... Oh, good evening Mrs. Hartley. Is it looking for your good man, you are? Yes, dinner is on the table. Well, I just saw him walking up near the big church, beyond the Avenue. - St. Peter's? - Aye. So, how and when good old Saint Peter got to be a protestant... is something I don't know, a turn at all. Thanks Mrs. McNamara. Bishop Northcott? - I told Brooks I was not to be disturbed. - I know, I heard you tell him. In that case, if you'll excuse me, I'll... Please Bishop, give me a chance, won't you? Sit down Mrs. Hartley. John and I are miserably unhappy. Did John send you? Oh John wouldn't, he isn't that kind, he never complains. But I just found out that life doesn't mean anything to him outside the church. He's miserable. He's got a look on his face that makes you, makes you want to cry. I can do nothing. - He persisted in acting foolishly and... - Oh, don't say that, don't blame him. The whole mess started because he took me in when they thought I was dying. Oh, you've got to do something. I can't go all through life knowing that he's miserable just because of me. Why do you come to me? I have nothing to do with it. I know better than that, you could fix it up somehow if you wanted to. - What do you mean? - Oh, don't be angry Bishop. I didn't mean to offend you, what I was trying to say is.. No, I'm not pleading for myself, I love John. I love him so much, I can't sleep. I lie awake nights thinking of him there beside me and unhappy. Oh, I love him so Mr. Northcott that if you'll take him back, I'll give him up. - I'll get a divorce. - What? A minister divorced by his wife? It, it's unthinkable. Then I'll let him divorce me. We'll frame up something that'll make him seem fine and me awful. You're talking nonsense. No congregation in the world would accept a divorced man as its minister. You're just saying that, it isn't true. In my comprehension, there is no such thing as divorce. His people won't have John because he's married to me. And the church won't have him if he's divorced. Well.. That seems to leave just one way out. Eh? What's that you say? I'm all packed up Beef, there's just one more thing I've got to do. The hardest thing I've ever done in my life. You mean, you ain't told Father Hartley yet? No. And stop calling him father, he isn't anybody's father and he isn't likely to be. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello Beef. - Hello father. The trunks are in here Beef. Trunks? I'm going back to the circus John. What? Polly, you don't mean that. Oh, I know it hasn't been very pleasant here for you but... it won't always be like this. Oh, it isn't that. I just can't stand this sort of life. I'm dying on my feet here. I want to go somewhere where it's gay and cheerful and light-hearted. Where there's always something going on. Then our marriage is a mistake? Oh John, you and I are different, you belong to the church and I belong to, to the circus. We were all steamed up about each other... rushed into the thing without sufficient thought. Polly, are you trying to tell me that you don't love me? Love? What is love anyway? You meet a man and you think you can't live without him. - Then some other man comes along and... - Has another man come along? I see. - Well, I suppose you want a divorce. - No. What's the use? Life is too short. In a circus, anything can happen. - Alright Beef, let's go. - On the last rope Polly. So all these months, you've just been, what you'd call kidding me along. Well, I suppose if I'd been a little more sophisticated I'd have known. Small time minister he, well, he shouldn't be expected to know. Maybe you get a church again, after I'm gone. John? Will you, will you kiss me goodbye? Ok Polly. What's got into you? Beef, what was he reading? Entreat me not to leave thee.. Or to return from following after thee. For whither thou goest, I will go. And where thou lodgest I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people and thy God, my God. Where thou diest, will I die. And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me and more also. If ought but death part thee and me. We will load up on extra blues. Step on it, we got a big jump tonight. Hey, you two boys, get that guy off that horse top. - Hi Beef. - Hi Polly. I just heard Don and Eric have been using a net since I left. Well, that don't make it no harder, does it? Well, you tell Billy no net tonight or I don't go on and that's that. Hey listen, don't get hard boiled with me just because you're sore at your pastor. You mind your own business. You had any sense, you wouldn't have left him. Maybe in a couple of months everything would been alright and he had a new pasturage. Why, you big.. Say.. I'm sorry Beef, don't mind me. I'm just nervous. It's alright, but don't forget it was me that learned you your ABC's. I've been a lot of trouble, haven't I? Oh, I wouldn't say that. No more trouble bringing you up than it would've been say a couple of young wildcats. You've done a lot for me Beef. Sure, when I think of the days you was bad you screamed and yelled and kicked my shins. Oh, forget those times Beef. Just remember the times when I was good... and sat quiet in my little chair and learned my arithmetic. Won't you Beef? I'm just trying to remember any time you was good and sat quiet in your little chair. - Come in Uncle James. - Glad to see you. John, I've thought things over. I wish you'd ask Polly to come in. I've something to say to you two children. I'm sorry Uncle James but Polly... - Polly has left me. - Left you? What you mean? She's gone to Lynn to join the circus. John, I don't understand. Well she, she seemed to think that I'd be much happier without her. She said I'd probably get my church back when she was gone. When she was gone? John, Polly came to see me. I was mistaken in that young lady, she's a fine girl John. And she loves you, loves you better than anything else in this world. And there isn't anything she wouldn't do for you. - You understand? Anything. - What do you mean? I mean we'd better get to Lynn as soon as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness... the most spectacular, the most hazardous... And the most breathtaking performance... ever attempted on the flying trapeze. Well, you got your way, we work without a net. No wonder your act is been a flop. With a net, it must've looked like something the kids... - do in the basement of a Sunday school. - Oh, yeah? Well, see you later. Watch your step. You're out of practice Polly, better watch your step. This road never seemed so long before. The road is clearing here, we make better time now. It's something awful funny about Polly tonight. - Cut the triple, finish on the next trick. - Ok. The triple is out, cut after the next. - Who says so? - Eric. - I want the triple in. - But he said... Eric is always trying to boss me, What's he think he is? A Bishop? - You almost got it Polly, better quit. - I'm not quitting. - Where's Polly? - Hello fella, what's the excitement? - Beef, where's Polly? - She's on doing her act now. - Oh, I hope we're not too late. - Too late? This hazardous feat will be performed... fifty feet in midair, fifty feet above the ground... without a net. Better cut it Polly, I don't think you'll make it. If I'm supposed to make it, I'll make it. Polly. And I'll make it. - Ok Bishop? - Ok Polly.
