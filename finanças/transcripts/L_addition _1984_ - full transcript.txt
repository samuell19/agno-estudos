Who did you say? No, I can't see her. Oh, in red! Yeah, I'm on to her! Yes, I can see her. Miss, please! Show me your bag please. Excuse me. No! Not so fast, miss! Please! Okay, okay! Show me your bag. Oh! Caviar, hey? - The biggest too. Come along. - I just wanted caviar. There's the caviar. How much do I owe you? Do you know each other? Are you here together? No, but I think that'll change. Say what I owe so that we can feast on caviar by candlelight. This is theft. You can't pay for it. Let's go! It's mine. Let me pay. Too late, miss, you should have known. Now, let's go. En route! I'll gift you the caviar to give to your wife. He doesn't need it, he must steal some every day. People like him work in security to be able to swipe things easily. Split personality. Seeing how little they have anyway, there can't be much left if they split it. FOOD MALL I'm sure they are together! Sadly not. I'd like that to be true. Stop joking around! You're funny. We don't know each other! Shut up, you! Go back home with your syphilis! It'll mean one less foreigner in France! This is insane. I can't believe I'm here for four ounces of caviar and a chick who forgot to give me her number… You make me laugh. You hit the security officer. Then you mocked the cops instead of groveling. Go on. Don't worry. You'll go to court in eight days and get a suspended sentence. Stay seated. Do you plan to call a taxi? All guys are the same. If they know they can't go anywhere, they can't stop moving. Look at them. We've got all shapes and sizes here. A big pimp, a little pimp, a bankrupt… And to finish… A poor dude who got four months for stealing sardines in a supermarket. They asked him how many sardines were in the can. "Four, Your Honor." Four months! It's lucky he didn't steal a can of peas. I knew you'd loosen up. And Lino Ventura over there? Who's he? That's Constantini. He got 15 months in solitary. Ah so he's the… star. Drugs, whores, racketeering… If he'd done less you wouldn't know his name. To get glory, instead of his head being cut off, he had the heads of others cut off. Let me look closer. I don't recommend it. He likes being an outsider. Careful! Get lost! Sorry, I didn't have time to say bye the other day. It wasn't very polite. Anyway, it was pointless for me to stay. Plus, you were wrong. Never get angry when you've been caught. - How did you find me? - I knew you. I saw you in a play last year. And apart from… Who are you? The shoplifting? Not that. That's nothing. It wasn't for any real reason. No… I work at a consulate. I can't take the credit for being rude to them. Are you pleased that I'm here though? Yes, but next time a stranger talks to you, don't strike up a conversation, because they'll suffer as a result. Don't say that. I don't know what to do. It's really bothering me. I could come every day. No, don't worry. I'm learning a lot in here. That guy is a genius, for example. He's told me incredible things. It's even given me an idea for a play. Oh yeah? What kind of play? It's about a society where you can do jail time in advance. You go to see the judge and you say, "Hi, I'd like 20 years." After doing 20 years, you can do a crime that matches the sentence. You could choose to rape a bishop, you could cut off the nuts of a fool who pisses you off… Do you understand "nuts"? Yes. His balls. That's a good one. I'm happy to have met you. I sense we'll have fun together. Especially me. My name is Patty. See you. Oh! On your knees. Give me the keys. Face the wall! You… Open up. - Don't get into this, kid. - Still, crazy! Open, bastard! Come on, quickly! Hurry up! Come on! If you don't shut it, I'll shoot you. And I'll blow your balls off! Go! There's one. Stop! Go! Go! The keys! I'll make you eat the keys, bitch! Oh! Move, moron! Move! They are escaping! - Come here, you! - Call the Doc, quick. My leg, kid. My leg. It would be a shame for you, if I lost it… Let's go. Constantini. Did you know him? Were you his buddy? Hats off if you were his bro. We hadn't guessed. Shut it, you're pissing me off. Anyway, you're screwed. You're going down, for sure. Silence. Save your breath for the director! Winckler! The stage door is this way. COURTROOM He's going to get it. Are you crazy? Shit! I don't know your guy! Just listen to me, okay? I never saw him, I'm telling you! Goddammit! It will all be fine if you're not guilty. It's pointless putting me in here! I had no more to say. Don't panic. You might have better luck with the examining magistrate! You're crazy… You can't leave me in this hole for 15 days… I want to call a lawyer. I want to be listened to! Can you hear me? Sorry… I might not look great. They sent me to the Bahamas but it was raining. Your lawyer convinced the judge you had no link to Constantini. So why won't they let me out? We can do nothing unless the injured warden drops the charges. Let him come see me so we can talk it over. Surely I won't rot in prison six months waiting for trial! I did all I could to see him. I went to the hospital. I wrote to him. I tried calling, but to no avail. He's refusing everything. Don't worry. Anyway, his accusations won't be worth a penny in court. Why are you doing this? Because you feel responsible? Yes, that must be the reason. Or maybe there's another. LE PARISIEN, OPENING - It's a shame. You're a good guy. - Why is it a shame? Because you landed on Lorca. Here, look. There. That prick's so proud. He's being honored because he fell in action. Calves get parsley up their nose, and men get medals. Lorca is crazy, dude. He's not a hack because he couldn't get other work, he's a hack because he likes it. Even his colleagues can't stand him. Great, so they won't vouch for him. Yeah, of course they will. They believe it's the truth. They will put up a united front. You're pissing me off with this nonsense. I asked for nothing. I'm a clairvoyant. As there's nothing to see in jail I decided to be a clairvoyant. That way I can look at things. I predict everything and I'm never wrong. When he was a jockey, he would predict the next day's results. Is that why he got ten years? You didn't predict that, did you? No. It's because I wounded the guy who informed on me. I've got two more years to kill and you'll do them for me. I can see it. That's kind, because I can't hack it anymore. Minet? Help! Quickly! Help! He didn't miss this time. Suspicion of scheming between Constantini, Lenuzza and Winckler is ruled out. So the charges relate to the following points. "By climbing a rope which unknown accomplices threw in from outside, Constantini loses the revolver and gun that were in his possession." According to your statement, you picked up the gun to take aim at Constantini. I'm an excellent marksman, Your Honor. Constantini had lost a 11,43 gun. I could have disarmed him by hurting his wrist, that's all. I could have stopped him escaping and doing more crimes. Let's not forget, Your Honor, that the warden Mr. Pauly had been shot. Mr. Lorca was acting in self-defense. With an interposed victim, Your Honor. And we get to the heart of the problem here. Constantini asks you for help, you push Lorca to divert his shot and, in consequence… Your Honor! That's false, Constantini asked me to do nothing. I did not push Albert Lorca! We need to be specific, You Honor. These aren't the exact details of my statement. Constantini shouted "Move, moron" at Winckler. I was pushed by the accused. I stumbled. The consequence? You aim and miss. Constantini has time to fire and aim at your leg. I'll limp all my life, Your Honor. I've a plastic kneecap. It lasted a quarter second and you're making a drama out of it! I saw Constantini's revolver being pointed at me. It's true. I was scared. You know who Constantini is, Your Honor. You were hanging on to me, I moved away. I didn't want you to fall over. It was a reflex, Your Honor. Who wouldn't have done that in that situation? Maybe. Actually, I… I never said that Winckler pushed me on purpose. In the moment I thought I had slipped. Alarm. Panic. My colleagues persuaded me. It wasn't a coincidence. I didn't fall by accident, Your Honor. Do you stand by your statements, gentlemen? Certainly, Your Honor. We saw everything. It's when Lorca aimed at Constantini that Winckler pushed him. The defendant had no reason for fear. The crook was at Lorca's mercy. That means you are responsible for Constantini's jailbreak. According to this brave warden. That's absurd. What was in it for me? I only have a few days left! Yes, but you couldn't help yourself. You were victim of what we call a revealing reflex. Your Honor, Bruno Winckler's accused of having wounded a security officer. Bruno Winckler is a director! An artist. In other words, this warden stands for everything I must hate. Established order, the respect of society! You've got an outdated view of artists, prosecutor. I don't care about crooks, I hate them as much as you do! When choosing between an honest warden and this crook, you sacrificed the warden. Your Honor, I demand that Winckler's sentence be two years of imprisonment. I'm sorry, this compartment is taken. Yes, I know. But there's no room elsewhere. I'm sorry. It's impossible. Can't I stay here in the meantime? That won't be possible. I don't understand. Get me out of here. Get me out! You know that we appealed. We must continue. This is insane. Please, get me out of here. We'll win. We'll win. Don't move. - Don't move. - She's my wife. There's no danger. Do you want me to get naked too? Come on, get out. That's enough. Keep your seats! You've not rented the corridor, have you? Forget it, Patty! I'm can't talk to him, but I can look at him, right? Bruno, I did some research. The prison where you're going is modern and brand new! - Hello, Director. - Antoine… This is Winckler, Director. Hello, Winckler. Hello. Will I be in here for two years? You've got one hour to settle in. Then you'll join your fellow inmates. If you need something, you press here. There. Excuse me. Excuse me. Why the hell are you here? I'm happy for you. It's warm, it's cozy. Naturally. Artists have got taste. What's wrong? You should be delighted, no? You'll to be in a play for two years. It's a success. We can act in it together, if you want? Am I too old? Go on, speak. There's no video monitoring. No one can see us. No one can hear us. Oh, it's my leg. It's too stupid. I lost my knee in an accident. You won't find it here. We'll see about that, kid. I'm not short of time. Lorca. Open up. A newbie! He might feel a bit disoriented. Help him adapt. Oh yeah! Plus, he's got a very pretty wife. Shut up. Sweat, hurt yourselves. It'll save you thinking about ass. For your chick, do as I do. Go to the kitchen and get intimate with a piece of steak. Okay? Come here to sit on my legs. Right now, I'm not in the mood. Come on, hurry up! Shit, let him settle in! What's going on over there? Nothing, chief. José is doing abs exercises. I'm here for 20 years. I need cash. Each time your floozy visits, I want 200. Do you need a pay stub with that? I'm warning you. If I don't get the dough, she'll end up with 15 guys on her. We'll leave a souvenir on her mug. Like this. RING THE BELL FOR ENTRY I want you. I'm dying of it. Why don't you want me to come anymore in that case? Tell me. No. I can't. There are cameras everywhere in this whorehouse. To talk without being seen you must lie on the floor. Like rats. With guys around you as a screen. Tell me what you're scared of. You need to be very careful. I don't want you to be out alone in Paris. Do you hear me? You always need to be accompanied. Did they threaten you, is that it? Do you want me to warn the cops? Your lawyer? No, no. Especially not. I must see if it's a bluff. Time for your stroll. Optional. Those who wish may stay in their cells. Layer up, it's not warm outside. The temperature outside is eight degrees. The outdoor temperature will be eight degrees. Our cruising speed will be four jerk-offs a day. - Minimum. - Yes. We will soon arrive… …nowhere. Stop, you're going to make me cry. Stay in your cell. Don't come. - Watch me. - You're an idiot. Come on, gents. Go get some sunlight. There. One for us. That's 15. Let's switch sides. Give it here. It's absurd. Careful. Black. You lost two smokes. No, you owe me two. - Asshole. - Oh yeah, that's right. There. Hey. Charlie. 32 francs for a gram. That's too much. Do you smoke? Sometimes, yes. I can get you some lines. No thanks, I'm hyper enough as it is. Special price for you. Fetch. Fetch! I'm coming. I'm coming. So? You were asking after me? Did she come? Where's the dough? Actually, I've got good news. Between you and me… you won't get a penny. If anything happens to my wife, I'll be like you. I'll have nothing to lose. So, I'm warning you. I'll put a hole in you. Right here. With a fork. Back inside, gentlemen. Sport time is over. Take that! Who did this? It's nothing. I slipped on the stairs. I couldn't see anything. My back was turned. And you? You didn't see anything. You had no time to intervene. It went too fast, Governor. There weren't enough of us. We look right and it happens on the left. Fine, Antoine. Thanks, Director. You've always had good grades, Lorca. Too good, even. Previous superiors criticized you for being overzealous. They probably weren't used to enough zealousness. No doubt. But… Why did you suddenly decide to be transferred to this prison? I wanted to work in a modern establishment. It's a logical career progression. Winckler's presence here… I'd made my request two days before he was sent here. Indiscretions always happen. - Maybe you knew. - No, Director. No. Anyway, he is an inmate like any other to me. I hope so, Lorca. I trust you. If I'm mistaken… you'll pay dearly for it. Do you see? Okay. You do like this. If a simpleton like me can get the hang of it… It's not complicated. Put the plank on the gap… Spread your fingers. There. Do you know what we made here before? Caskets. I quite enjoyed it. It reminds me of a guy I knew. He was loaded. When he knew he was dying, he went round his whole area to get a second-hand casket. I'm not surprised. Guys like that are suckers. The more they have the stupider they are. Switch places with me. Last year we tattooed the dick of a smartass like you. Disobey and we'll tattoo dicks on your fingers. You'll have to wear gloves all your life. Admit it would too stupid, just to save 250 a month. Got it? I don't get it. Let's talk another time. Excuse me. I'd like to visit you in your cell more often but the director thinks I'm pampering you too much. And that it's favoritism. What do you expect? He must sense that we're crazy about each other. Tell me, what are you hoping for in that degenerate head of yours? Let me tell you. I've been doing this job and meeting murderers for 15 years. I've never witnessed a murder. It's lacking in my life. I'd like to see the effect it has. You might see it too close up. Calm down. You'll do yourself out of your leave. What would you rather? Screwing your fiancée in Paris or punching me in the face? General closure. You're not a real jailbird yet. A real jailbird would prefer the punch. Patience. You'll get there. - Are you sure? - Certain. How are you? Can I drive? Yes, of course. This one. I'm going to buy croissants. What do you want? Brioche? Bread? There must be honey in here. Look, blueberry… Apricot, probably moldy. We'll eat lunch at a restaurant terrace by Saint-Cloud park, even if it's raining. It might be a bit tight. It's already 2 p.m. Tonight or tomorrow then. Tomorrow, we'll take a stroll in the forest. And the day after tomorrow? Why are you talking about that? - I wasn't thinking about it. - Well I was. I don't want your three days of leave every trimester! It's worse than anything. You come and then leave. That's not love. Love can't be eaten in small bites. For us, the most beautiful moments are now. When you're out in a year they'll have ruined everything. What do you want me to do? We can't do anything. And Lorca scares me. You're not telling me everything. What were you scared of the other day in the visiting room? Stop… I'm here for another two days. Let me chill out. MUSIC FOR CHAMELEONS You won't go back there. We'll run away. Just put a photo on this passport, and we can join my brother in Mexico. How did you get this? You were sentenced via false witness. Now you've got false papers. It's tit for tat. You're mad. I'm not spending my life on the run. Please Bruno. If you return, I don't know why but I feel we won't see each other again. Yes, Director. They are in position. It starts in a minute. Everyone in the hallway! Everyone in the hallway! Faster than that. Faster! Leave your cells! Everyone in the hallway! Get a move on. You too! We know there's weed and heroine smuggling going on! If you own up right away… we'll be more lenient. I'm not surprised. Drugs ruin memory. A general search! Turn around. Face the wall. Nothing in that one, chief. Crampon's cell is like a pharmacy. Not that one. Next one. Next one! There. Bastard. Chief. Cocaine. Cell reintegration! Put Crampon, the two clowns and José in the hole! Stop! Stop! Bastard! Bastard! It's not my fault! It's not my fault! I didn't snitch on anyone! Bastard! Bastard! It wasn't me! Shit! Yeah, he'll find it hard to get them to believe it. Shit! Get a move on, it's like being in a nursing home. Move it, I said! We're not doing anything against the rules! When we signed the hotel form, no one told us, "Have fun, it's compulsory". Don't worry, bitch. They won't touch you. We're saving you for José! For when he's out of the hole. José will wipe the ground with you. He will tie his balls into a bow tie. Can't you see he's the one who has it in for me? Tell them! "My leg, kid. For your sake, I hope I don't lose it." "I've done this job 15 years. I've never seen a crime. I'm missing out." "I know it's not your fault but it'll be hard convincing them." Go on. Ask him to translate. He may be stupid, but he's got memory! What do we do? Lock him up? It's not guilt that's making your mate crazy! It's fear! He's shitting himself. He's going mad. Why would I have betrayed you? I don't care about your nonsense. - Because José was bothering you. - Even more likely. Your guy is mad. Why would I do anything crazy if it means I'll get my ass kicked later? The stuff he said when imitating… are your sentences, chief? Why are you making shit up, Winckler? I'm not making anything up. It's the truth. You're afraid he'll beat you. Yes. He's making things up so that I put him in the hole. Come on! Go! Don't worry, kid. We're here to protect you. Wait. Maybe it's not him. Ah! Come on, get undressed. - Hello Patty. - Hello. I saw the magistrate. Visits have been suspended, I don't know for how long. No way, we have to go there right away. Listen, I need to see Bruno. I need to talk to him. They won't let you in. He's in isolation. Work something out. I don't care. We'll ask the director. I want to know what happened. How it happened. He committed a murder! Can you imagine how it is to kill a man? He didn't have a choice. Would you rather he be dead? I don't know. If he stays there it's worse than death. - We need to get him out. - Of course, Patty. I'm going to get him out. Well done. We're in all the papers. Who's paying for it? I am. "An inmate in the same jail as the warden who had him sentenced. The result? Murder." I've got the inspectorate on my back. I wasn't involved in this tragedy, Governor. - That's not what your colleagues think. - They are wrong! Winckler is a dangerous person. He's not eaten or spoken in three days! He wants to be sent to the asylum. It'll be easier for him to tell journalists tales. You can go, Lorca. I've got your back for the time being, but if there's an issue, you'll face a tribunal or early retirement. I'd still need to ask for retirement. Winckler's crime didn't get you your knee back! I don't need a disabled person! Hey man! Can you hear me? Don't panic. You've not lost your toy. I've got two solutions. I've got two solutions. Either I kill myself or I kill you! Are you feeling better? Obviously. Being reunited with a friend helps. Move. I'll go. Please find me a blade. Anything. A knife, scissors. What for? None of your business. You'll do nothing stupid will you? No. You'll like it. Are you scared of me? Yes. Lorca. He had me in a corner. There was no way out. Everyone knows it. You need to talk, to say everything. No. Worst case, he'd be fired. That's not what I want. I want to be certain you don't think I'm guilty… so I'm going to kill him. You're crazy! Since that pig has always dreamed of being an actor, he can bequeath his skull to a theater company so that he can occasionally be in Hamlet. On the contrary, you're going to escape. I don't know how I'll do it, but I'll get you out, I swear. - I've still got the passport. - No way. Lorca belongs to the guy I killed. I'll return Lorca to him. It can't be true. I can't believe it's you saying this. You're reasoning like a madman. Listen carefully. If you do something like that, I'll never see you again. You won't hear from me again, understood? Be nice. Rather than sending flowers to that bastard's funeral, bring him a cactus. Open up! Open up! That moron is lucky to be as loved as he is. Listen. I'm going to sell everything. I'll give you a lot of money. He needs to get out. You're wrong about me. I'm not interested in money. Anything. Tell me what you want? It would be my pleasure, but I can't do that to him. I want to kill you. It should be me! I should kill you. Instead of who? Division one, division two, division three, 19:45. Cells. Come on, hurry. It's time. Come on! Go! Be careful. …in the north. Shit! Lights out in the cells. How's the kneecap? You wanted my life, so take it. Go all the way. Tomorrow will be too late. I'm being transferred you'll be fired. You'll lose me. Just think, you're nothing without your job. Let's both clear off. They'll never find us. What's wrong, Albert? Are you going mad? What's in your pocket? A knife? A revolver? Come on, get it out! You'll see. Killing is easy. Go on! Go on! Walls are the only thing that turn you on. If you stab me you'll be with them 24/7. I'll wait until you're truly scared. I don't want to ruin my pleasure. I'll die laughing before that happens. I knew it. You're just a piece of shit. A criminal by delegation. Get out. Come on, leave. I've got all night. I'd be amazed if we were both still alive in the morning. I think so too. I'm suddenly tired. Can you wake me later? Take your clothes off. There's a third solution. I get out of here! I've got all night. I'd be surprised if we were both still alive tomorrow morning. You've got no chance. You were wrong. I'm going to leave your balls intact. That would be the worst that could happen to you. Stop! Lorca. Open. MESSMER, "YES, MITTERRAND SOUNDS LIKE DE GAULLE BUT…" I'm done in. I'll let you finish alone. Okay. See you tomorrow. Broken again. See you, Lorca. Scumbag. Oh! - Patty! - Bruno! Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
