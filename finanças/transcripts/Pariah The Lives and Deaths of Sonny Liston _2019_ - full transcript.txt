He heralded in the era of giant heavyweights without, in fact, being a giant heavyweight himself. He was only a little bit over six feet tall, and he weighed about 200 pounds.

His fists were like huge hams. His jab was his greatest weapon, and it was the greatest jab any heavyweight's ever had. Most fighters use jabs just to set the opponent up. Usually it's not that hard.

[Collins] I don't think the general public ever knew the real Sonny Liston. They knew the persona, the thug-like guy who just knocked everybody out and was associated with the mob and been in jail.

And I think that's pretty much where she was. I think in a way they really loved each other. ♪♪♪ You know, there was one thing that Sonny was better at than boxing, and that was compartmentalizing himself. He could be a loving husband, he could be a womanizer, he could be a criminal, he could be a boxer. That's what he was a master at: boxing and being able to lead so many different lives. There were so many men inside that one man. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] By the mid-'50s, he's a boxer of some repute. He's a leg breaker for the mob. He's an alley dweller. You know, Sonny never walked on well-lit streets. Sonny moved around in darkness. So there was a running battle between the police and Sonny Liston. The police harassed him.

This is a black man in St. Louis beating up a cop and taking his gun. That was an unheard of lenient sentence, and you gotta figure that there was some people connected behind that. The mob makes their phone calls and makes sure that if they need a fighter to be available to the fight, he's not kept inside for any length of time.

Simple as that. ♪♪♪ He didn't talk about hurting someone. He didn't talk about dealing anything. He was doing just what his job had given him. To be a fighter. With Willie Reddish, you know, he had to work for the first time in his career. He really had to train hard. And that was the missing piece of the puzzle. ♪♪♪ [Farrell] They started putting him in with the elite fighters of the heavyweight division-- the guys who nobody wanted, and the guys who really would beat you.

Sonny merely was in his own version of Heaven. ♪♪♪ He was getting paid money to knock people down, and nobody could arrest him. ♪♪♪ And he got better and better and better. ♪♪♪ The most impressive fight, he fights a guy named Cleveland Williams. Sonny Liston and Cleveland Williams is like Thor fighting Hercules. You know, it was no holds barred. These are the two hardest punching fighters in the world at that time. No one wanted to fight either one. I remember both fighters just swinging, swinging at the wind, going for it. Trying to knock each other out. Cleveland Williams almost knocked Sonny Liston out of the ring. He broke a rib. He battered him. He was lucky to make it through the round. That was his epiphany. I think he saw that, "If I'm gonna lose, I'll be back in prison, I'll be back in poverty." And I think his managers and trainers read the riot act to him. "Sonny, all you have is your ability as a fighter. And you have to win." [Announcer] Liston moves in with lefts and rights. Hammer blows to the head and body. [Majeski] Sonny doesn't give up, and he knocks him out in one of the great fights of all time. [Announcer] One look at Williams' face, and you know the end is near. ♪♪♪ Everybody was scared when he knocked out Cleveland Williams. At this point, Sonny was the best heavyweight in the world. He had cleared out the dangerous part of the heavyweight division, and he'd done it in a way that was so unilateral that he was undeniable. [Announcer] And a fast right to the head puts Harris down. ♪♪♪ The fight is over. Sonny Liston sets his sights on the heavyweight championship. Every guy who hit the canvas was one body to step over on the way to a world title fight. ♪♪♪ [cheers and applause] [announcer] Sonny, let's talk about your future now. Who do you wanna fight in the ring in your next engagement? The man who got the title. He thought that the title would turn him into somebody different. He saw a chance to reinvent himself. He had people who wanted to talk to him, newspaper reporters who wanted to cover him, because they knew where this was going. ♪♪♪ [Collins] The problem was when he got close to getting a title fight, that's when all the resistance started. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] We have a guy by the name of Kefauver, senator from Tennessee, who's investigating corruption in America. This is an age where America was looking for corruption all over the place, whether it was communists or labor unions or what have you. And Kefauver decides boxing is corrupt. ♪♪♪ [Lipsyte] Estes Kefauver saw these hearings as an opportunity to be on this very new thing called television. You gotta remember, it's not like television today where they'll put a camera in the grave if they can get away with it. This was a whole new idea. Have you ever threatened any manager or boxer or promoter at any time? I respectfully decline to answer the question on the ground that I cannot be compelled to be a witness against myself. [Roberts] The spotlight is on Frankie Carbo. It's on Blinky Palermo. It's on the other henchmen in the mob involved with boxing. And Sonny Liston's tied to all of them. ♪♪♪ So this is a problem. Sonny Liston, at a time when he's becoming absolutely the most famous fighter in the world, is becoming known as absolutely the most criminally tied fighter in the world. [Collins] It hurt his reputation. The stuff was already there. But it broadcasted to a much wider audience. [Assael] J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI are also obsessed-- I mean obsessed--with Sonny being a linchpin between the mob and boxing. This is evidenced by all the FBI reports where you could see Hoover was following Sonny's career closely. ♪♪♪ [Collins] They didn't want a guy like Sonny Liston having what was probably the most prestigious prize in sports at the time. ♪♪♪ [Farrell] In order to fight for the heavyweight championship, Sonny Liston would have had to fight Floyd Patterson. And Patterson's an interesting figure because he was a very, very popular champion. ♪♪♪ [Majeski] And he has one of the cagiest, most brilliant, most insane managers in the history of the sport, Cus D'Amato. And Cus D'Amato did not want to expose this property of his to Sonny Liston. [Farrell] And he had a built-in excuse since he could say, "Well, we don't want the heavyweight title even potentially falling into the hands of the mob." [Collins] The time that Sonny lived and fought in was a time of change in America. He was caught in the crosshair of a huge upheaval in this country. ♪♪♪ The Civil Rights era was starting. A lot of changes were being made. [Rigueur] We're seeing new kinds of protest, uh, strategies like the sit-in movement. [Announcer] This is the scene of sit-downs in the past. However now we are told the marchers have stopped here and a song will be sung. [Rigueur] Bus boycotts. African-Americans pushing back against societal norms that are telling them that they are less than. I would rather die on the highways of Alabama than make a butchery of my conscience. Also civil rights organizations are picking and choosing people that they see as model citizens to essentially prove that African-Americans are deserving of citizenship. And so Floyd Patterson fits this idea. Now we've heard this word "viciousness--" that a fighter has to have a vicious attitude before he goes into the ring. Now, how do you feel about that? Well, not in all cases, no. I disagree with that. In fact, I've only had the vicious attitude in one fight. ♪♪♪ [Majeski] Floyd Patterson was the Sidney Poitier of boxing. You know, very soft spoken, guy you would want to go out with. He was involved with civil rights. He was friendly with Jackie Robinson. He was friendly with Nelson Rockefeller. He was meeting senators. [Jeffries] He's not a uppity negro. He's just there to get along, uh, and he won't upset the apple cart, if you will. That's why the NAACP and others feel comfortable with him as being sort of the face of this effort to really desegregate-- integrate America. ♪♪♪ Sonny Liston's America's worst nightmare. He is literally a dangerous negro. And he's a dangerous negro who's unafraid of white people, as demonstrated by his consistent and constant encounters with the police. [Tyson] He had a bad rap for always being mob connected. He was like a black eye to the black community. So nobody wanted to be associated with him. No respectable person. ♪♪♪ [Rigueur] He's imposing, he's violent, he's abrupt, he has no connection to the civil rights movement. And he's unapologetic about it. [Announcer] Sonny, what do you think about the American Revolution in 1963? Well, I think it's a simple matter, but, um, a lot of peoples is carrying this thing a little too far for what it is. [Farrell] As he always said about the riots, "I don't have a dog-proof ass." He's not gonna get torn apart for somebody else. ♪♪♪ The reason why we don't really associate Sonny Liston with the civil rights movement, uh, is because the civil rights movement didn't associate itself with Sonny Liston. Image was very important, and that's exactly what Sonny Liston didn't have. [Farrell] I know for a fact that JFK told Patterson he needed not to fight Sonny Liston. Which, if you think about it, is an enormous statement coming from the President of the United States in regard to a prize fight. ♪♪♪ [Reddish Jr.] He had earned his title. He had earned the championship fight. Of course he had been incarcerated as a youngster. Absolutely. They should have been encouraging him and giving him a second chance, so why deny him? I thought it was a disgrace. ♪♪♪ Sonny, I understand that you have a statement to make as far as fighters are concerned. Well, I've fought all the top contenders, and I've fought my way up to the number one spot, so what do a man have to do to get a earnest shot at the title? [Farrell] The real reason that Cus D'Amato didn't want Floyd Patterson to fight Sonny Liston is he was absolutely sure--as sure as everyone else-- that Patterson had no chance to win. Floyd didn't stand a chance. He was, you know-- He was too light. He was too weak. He was scared. And there's no way you're gonna beat Sonny if you're scared. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] Cus D'Amato's goal with Floyd Patterson is never to match him up against anybody that's of any competence whatsoever. The downfall of Floyd Patterson came with a great televised double-header where Patterson defended his title against the great fighter Tom McNeeley. ♪♪♪ Tom McNeeley was nothing. The fight was a sham. On the same card, Sonny Liston fights Bert Westphal. Bert Westphal was a good fighter. [Announcer] Westphal has 12 K.O.s. [Collins] Westphal tries to stand up to Sonny Liston. Now he's mixing it in exchanges, then finally Sonny finds the range. [Announcer] Westphal has never been knocked off his feet until now. [Roberts] Liston destroys him. Liston is the champion. Patterson's the great pretender. [Announcer] Albert Westphal knocked out by Sonny Liston, who by virtue of this one-round K.O. tonight has taken a long step toward a fight with Floyd Patterson. Eventually, under mounting pressure, Floyd felt that in order to have any integrity-- personal integrity--he had to fight Sonny Liston. So he overrode D'Amato's concerns. [Farrell] When Patterson finally agrees to fight Sonny, it's seen as some supreme act of charity instead of what it really was, which was, you know, an obligation. I personally think that he has every right to fight for the championship despite his-- despite his unfortunate background. ♪♪♪ How excited was I when Sonny signed for the heavyweight championship of the world? Very excite--I just knew we were going to become the heavyweight champion. I knew it. That was his ambition in life. [Farrell] Sonny wanted this title because he thought it would complete him. Even with all that had happened-- the congressional hearings, the dozens and dozens of rousting by cops, the--the press-- it's one of the happiest times in his life. He had the fight of his dreams. [Laughter] [Izenberg] They make the fight. It's gonna be in Chicago. So I've immediately decided I'm gonna go to Floyd's camp first. He's the champion. Let's see what he has to say. ♪♪♪ It was the county poor farm. Rolling green hills. Blossoms, birdies tweeting. And little bunny rabbits hopping across the road. And I said, "This is Floyd Patterson's emotional home." He's got two chances-- slim and none. ♪♪♪ Now I go to see Sonny Liston. We walk down this concrete corridor which is ten degrees colder than outside. Sonny's taking these medicine balls to the stomach. Boom, boom, boom. And I'm looking at Sonny's face. He all but yawned as the ball hit his stomach. And I'm saying, "I thought there was two chances for Floyd--slim and none. Slim just went out the door." You feel that Liston is a capable opponent, I'm sure. Sure, I feel that, uh, he's a bit above and beyond capable. ♪♪♪ [Lipsyte] Before the fight, Sonny Liston goes into a Spartan condition. He really kind of picked up the rhythm of his training. They were longer, they were harder sessions. He really looked leaner and harder and faster. He gets himself into the best condition he will ever be for the rest of his life. ♪♪♪ He's prime to fight and try to take the title. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston fight-- there's been very few other fights like it. Very few in boxing history. I mean, in boxing, you always want a good guy and a bad guy. You want a black hat and a white hat, and you want the white hat to win. Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling, representative of democracy versus Nazi fascism. Well, the Patterson-Liston fight was the same thing. I mean, it's good versus evil. Fight, no. It was a morality play. ♪♪♪ When Liston goes into the ring, figuratively wearing his black hat, he's booed. It's almost as if you're in a movie. [Crowd booing] [Izenberg] I remember when they came in the ring. Liston was simply staring across the ring at Patterson. And Patterson was trying not to look, but every once in a while, he looked. And Cus D'Amato's saying, "I have faith in you. You can do it." It's a miracle he wasn't struck by lightning, because he didn't have any faith in him. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ [Farrell] Sonny Liston didn't come out looking to knock Floyd's head off. That's just not the way he fought. Liston was really a very, very complete fighter. He took opportunities as they presented themselves, and if you see the fight, you see that actually Patterson appears to be the more aggressive initially. ♪♪♪ Once he was on the inside, you know, Liston just took him apart. And Liston just moves in, catches him with a left, catch him with another left. ♪♪♪ [announcer] Solid left to the cheekbone dropped the champion. [Tyson] Floyd just went down. He just couldn't take the punishment and go down. It was too much power for him. Fight? There was no fight. It--It was a slaughter. And Sonny Liston wins the heavyweight championship of the world. [Majeski] When he became heavyweight champ, I think the perception was he's gonna be the title holder for the next 20 years. Nobody's gonna beat this man. [Roberts] The stadium was eerily quiet, almost funereal. In a way, it was a funeral. A funeral for Patterson. A funeral for our visions of what the boxing heavyweight champion should represent and should be. It was not a great beginning for the championship career of Sonny Liston. [Announcer] And the new champion is inarticulate in victory. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ ♪♪♪ [Izenberg] Sonny came into this fight with a second goal. He wanted respect. Take a look at his life.

Liston, who was disliked before the first fight, if anything, was more disliked now. Since he'd entrenched himself, he was now the champion. And I think Patterson-- who was deeply beloved before the fight--if anything was now held as a, you know, sort of last beacon of hope. [Announcer] Floyd is down for the third time. Lightning has struck again in the same round as the first fight. The only difference in the fight, really, was it lasted four seconds longer. Two minutes and ten seconds and, boop, that's it. [Announcer] Sonny Liston again knocks out Floyd Patterson in one round to successfully defend his world heavyweight title. The one thing significant about Patterson-Liston II is we got a glimpse of the future of professional sports. At the end of the fight, a guy by the name of Cassius Clay jumps in the ring and puts on a performance. ♪♪♪ At the time, the public thought Cassius Clay was crazy because he jumped in the ring threatening Sonny Liston after the Patterson fight. You've gotta remember nobody challenged Sonny Liston. Now, here's this up and coming young fighter jumping in, tell him, "I want you. I want you. You ugly." You know, he didn't know what to think. ♪♪♪ [Izenberg] This is really a low-class burlesque. However, um, nobody went broke underestimating the mentality of the American boxing fan. So they ate it up. The media fell in love with him. He was an easy story, this, you know, a narcissistic loudmouth. It's like covering Trump. Well, let me finish. Let me talk. This boy's modest. I'm the greatest. He's not a talker. I'm gonna fight Sonny Liston right after I annihilate Henry Cooper. And as soon as I annihilate Henry Cooper, I want that big ugly bear right in, uh, right here on Miami Beach. [Collins] Cassius Clay bugged Sonny Liston even before the fight was signed. It was part of his psychological warfare. He had a bus that he took to Sonny's house in the middle of the night screaming and yelling. [Roberts] "You gotta fight me! You gotta fight me! I'm the champion!" Lights are going off around the neighborhood. It pulls the police out there. Last thing Sonny Liston wants at his house are the police. He did anything he could think of to rattle Sonny. And let's face it, he was pretty creative. ♪♪♪ He hunts Sonny Liston down in Vegas. Sonny Liston is shooting craps. Cassius Clay shows up and says, "You can't even shoot craps! You're a loser!" It just pissed Sonny Liston off. You don't mess with Sonny Liston when he's about to throw the dice. So he got slapped for his trouble. ♪♪♪ All of a sudden he said, "Yeah, we're gonna fight. I'm gonna kill you." Sonny Liston took the fight because he thought he could destroy Cassius Clay. Don't you have any respect for him at all as a fighter? As a fighter? I think he should be locked up for impersonating a fighter. [Roberts] The promotion of the fight began as a classic promotion. Sonny Liston was very comfortable wearing the black hat by this time. He knew that was the only one he was going to wear. But then suddenly rumors appear that Cassius Clay has secretly joined the Nation of Islam. The Nation of Islam at this time is viewed as an anti-white hate organization. [Assael] I'd be like Rocky Marciano saying, "I'm a member of the Ku Klux Klan." It shocks white America. It shocks a lot of black America. [Jeffries] The only thing scarier to white America than the black brute is the black brute who is articulate and smart. And that's what, to white America, the Nation of Islam was. We know that we're going to lose a few, but we know that God going to kill all of you. [Cheering] [Jeffries] The head of the Nation of Islam was Elijah Muhammad. But it's Malcolm X-- his principal recruit-- uh, who has the charisma. ♪♪♪ [Rigueur] He provides a very stark contrast with the respectability model of middle class civil rights organizations. Malcolm X is saying, "Violence is as American as apple pie." That's our motto. We want freedom by any means necessary. [Rigueur] He is speaking a language of the dispossessed. He is speaking a language of people that have felt powerless. This is kind of going into this narrative that Clay has grown up with. ♪♪♪ When Malcolm X starts showing up and seeming buddy-buddy with Cassius Clay, it scares the hell out of promoters. [Kilroy] They wanted to keep--to keep him quiet. They didn't want him to say he belonged to the Nation of Islam because they were afraid no one would come to their fight, or no one would go to Closed Circuit. ♪♪♪ [Jeffries] This gives Liston the chance to be the hero that he had never been before. If he wins, he will be thanked by white America for shutting that dude up. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] The Liston-Clay fight in Miami in February of 1964 was a pivotal moment, really, in American history.

[Announcer] Cassius Clay's on the move, as we see, looking to get Sonny to lunge. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ Cassius Clay was outthinking Sonny Liston. Liston was fighting to the death, but he wasn't fighting Sonny. He was running through Sonny. And that threw Sonny off. But as he got close to the bell, he threw a flurry of punches that all landed. And that was to let Liston know that he had something too. ♪♪♪ And I'm saying, "That son of a bitch. I can't believe he's doing this to Liston. It's gotta be a trap. Liston's gotta be setting a trap." [Roberts] But then Clay starts hitting him. Hitting him a little bit harder. Right crosses, right leads. [Announcer] Sonny rattled, Sonny rattled. Cassius has him hurt! And all of a sudden there's puffiness under Liston's eye. And then suddenly in the third round, boom. [Announcer] He has a cut below the eye and he's getting hit with all the punches in the book. Liston had never been cut before in a fight. [Izenberg] Whoever was there saw the blood and then we went-- [gasps] It was like the room was a giant vacuum and suddenly sucked all the air out of it. And then when the bell rang and Liston was still upright-- [sighs] All the air went out again. Now, the fourth round was a, uh, notorious round. Clay started to feel a burning sensation in his eye. And it got worse. He told Angelo Dundee, his trainer, "Cut the gloves off. I can't see. We're going home." [Roberts] The question in Clay's corner is, what happened? Can we get this guy out fighting again? [Collins] What got in Clay's eyes is a matter of debate. Boxers use liniment sometimes on themselves to--muscle aches and stuff like that. The original theory was some of that had got on Liston's glove and accidentally got into Clay's eyes. I don't think that's what happened. Other fighters who had fought Liston--Cleveland Williams, Eddie Machen--had complained that something had gotten in their eyes--Monsel's solution in their eyes. The belief was--and that we have some evidence-- that Liston's gloves were loaded. Now, all hell breaks loose in that corner. That was not a corner of great decorum ever anyway, with Bundini and with Angelo. [Announcer] That's Angelo Dundee that he was arguing with, Joe. Angelo now is telling him off a little bit while he gets him ready. [Collins] Angelo Dundee was an old pro. He knew what to do. He said, "Cut this bullshit out. Go out there and run." [Roberts] And that led to the dramatic round five. The belief was Clay's gonna get killed. [Announcer] His eyes are bothering him. They're yelling from Cassius Clay's corner. [Rahmen Muhammad] Bundini was working the corner. And Bundini was saying, "Keep a yard stick out there! Keep a yard stick--" That mean keep the left hand out. 'Cause Sonny was trying to come at him, but literally the man was blind. ♪♪♪ Liston hits him a lot. ♪♪♪ Liston just can't hurt him, can't knock him out. And by the end of the round, the last minute of the round, Clay's eyes had cleared and Clay just takes him apart. Hits him with everything. Hits him with hooks. Hits him with jabs. Hits him with right hand leads. [Bell rings] [Collins] When Liston flopped his butt down on the stool at the end of the sixth round, he said, "That's it." Willie Reddish didn't know what he was saying. He put the mouthpiece in to go out for the next round. Sonny spit it out and he said, "I said that's it." And that was the end of the fight. [Bell rings] [announcer] They might be stopping it. That might be all, ladies and gentlemen. I think it was unacceptable that Sonny Liston didn't get off the stool. He should have carried on. [Lipsyte] If you're heavyweight champion, you die trying. But he just kind of sat there. He gave up. Why did he give up? And this, of course, is the mystery at the heart of it all. Did he give up because he was in such terrible agony he couldn't move? Did he give up because he suddenly realized he couldn't win this fight? Did he give up because he had been paid to dump it at some point? Um, who knows? ♪♪♪ [Farrell] There were two Clay-Liston fights. The first fight was the real fix. And let me talk about that a little bit. The mob isn't in the boxing business to do anything other than to make money. The odds were eight to one. They could make a tremendous amount of money betting against Liston. That was where the money really was. You know, a guy who would have had to go years and years fighting fights that didn't interest the public. Or you cash him in--this old guy--right away. This is really boxing 101. [Roberts] I think it's utter nonsense to say that first fight was fixed. If Sonny was trying to fix the fight, why was he loading up his gloves before round four? He was loading up the gloves to blind Clay to win the fight. [Rahmen Muhammad] Sonny wanted to kill that man. I guarantee and just about put my life on it. That wasn't no fix.

Muhammad means "worthy of all praises," and Ali means "most high." Yes, sir, I wanna be called by that name. I write autographs with that name. I wanna be known all over the world as that name. You want us to call you what name? That is the furthest thing from sort of the minds of white folk when it comes to black respectability. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] Shortly after that, Malcolm X was thrown out of the Nation of Islam by Elijah Muhammad. That tension between the two factions just continues to build with Elijah Muhammad and others really pushing this idea that Malcolm is a traitor and deserves no fate other than death. Malcolm X and anybody else who attacks or talks about attacking Elijah Muhammad will die. Just when you think the social issues that are swirling around boxing can't get any more raw, Malcolm X gets assassinated. ♪♪♪ Some thought that the Nation was behind his assassination. So to have Ali still fighting under the banner of the Nation adds this whole other overlay to that fight. So there was a real kind of undercurrent of existential terror up in Lewiston, Maine. All sorts of rumors floating around before this fight, that there are people who had supported Malcolm that were going to come to the fight and assassinate Muhammad Ali. ♪♪♪ There were rumors going around that white women were going to be smuggling hand guns into the arena for their black lovers to kill Cassius in the ring. And so they abled these cops and state troopers, they were opening up women's purses looking for guns, while at the same time nobody was guarding the doors or the windows, and local kids were climbing in. It was--it was crazy. [Izenberg] Sonny's plan was very simple. He would knock Ali out in the first round. He would put such pressure on him that Ali would have to fall. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ [Majeski] Liston got more cheers than Ali. They finally said, "Well, between these two, the lesser of the evils is Sonny Liston. So we'll cheer this ex-convict who lost his title on the stool rather than root for a guy who says he's a black Muslim separatist." The challenger, Sonny Liston. [Cheers and applause] [announcer] Sonny Liston very popular with the folks here in Lewiston, Maine. No kidding about that. [Majeski] He enjoyed that. He sort of basked in that kind of glory for the first time in his life. But then what happens is the Kennedy assassination of boxing. Everybody's got an idea. Nobody has the truth. When the fight started, it didn't last very long. ♪♪♪ There was hardly an exchange when Liston went down. I was at ringside and I didn't really understand what was going on. I was sitting next to Howard Cosell who had a monitor, so we replayed it 100 times right away to watch it again. And maybe by the 100th time, I saw the punch. I don't know. [Collins] He did clip him with a right hand. How hard it is, only Sonny Liston knew. I think the punch that Muhammad Ali hit Sonny Liston with in the second fight, I think it was enough to knock him down, especially if he didn't see the punch. [Rahmen Muhammad] I told Muhammad Ali to punch, then he knocked Sonny Liston out. It was them kind of punches you use in karate. You know, when you're punching in karate, you turn it when you hit. You know, it's a twist. Yow! Popped him right on the jawbone. And the punch was so fast and so quick. I didn't know the punch was gonna knock him out.

Walcott stops the fight. Utter absolute confusion. [Izenberg] A full-throated roar begins. Fix, fix, fix, fix. And I heard that for an hour, probably, while I was writing.

The second fight is picking up the few remaining chips off the table and going home. [Assael] Why fix the fight? Well, that's where the secret percentage theory comes in, which is that Sonny had agreed to an under-the-table deal to get a cut of Ali's future earnings if he went down. It's exactly what a mobster would have done and it's exactly, I think, what Sonny did do. The other reason that I think that theory is persuasive is the role of Ash Resnick. He was there at the fight. Think about it. That's exactly the kind of deal Ash was an expert at making. ♪♪♪ [Kilroy] It's not true. ♪♪♪ All the stuff about Sonny Liston having a part of Ali's purse, that never happened.

Wepner is increasingly beat up, and eventually the fight gets stopped because of the cuts. Liston won the fight.

It was a dangerous place. ♪♪♪ The people that he was hanging out with were killers. They would kill you in a heartbeat. Of course now, he wore a .38 on his ankle, so he was pretty well in with the crew.

I'm the one who really won." [Assael] There were a lot of people who didn't want the curtain lifted on what happened in his second fight with Ali. There were a lot of people who had an invested interest in shutting Sonny up. Around that time, people saw Sonny and Ash fighting. Ash had to be careful.

He just went right by me, pushed me out of the way, went into my dad's room, and I could hear a lot of things banging around in there. He was opening drawers, looking through stuff. Uh, I don't know if he found anything, but after a while he just left. My dad came back a couple of days later and I told him what happened, and he was really pissed, man. He said, "Mark, I have to tell you. I have to stress this. Do not go over to Sonny's house anymore. His days are numbered. I'm telling you." That's the way he said it. ♪♪♪ [Izenberg] I'm in Vegas for another fight. And I walk up to the Stardust and I see Sonny putting a tip down on the table and all these dirty dishes.

Sonny Liston, the fighter that Muhammad Ali used to call the big ugly bear was found dead today in his home in Las Vegas, Nevada. He had been dead about a week before his wife returning from a trip found the body. Investigators say there was no sign of foul play, but they found some substances they think may be drugs. ♪♪♪ [Collins] Geraldine not calling the police until three hours after finding Sonny's body is strange. There are a lot of theories. Um, one was that there was quite a stash of heroin at Sonny's house and they needed to get it out of there. [Gandy] But the police had found a balloon of heroin downstairs. It seemed strange that she wouldn't have disposed of it to save Sonny's reputation, if nothing else. I don't know where she went or who she talked to or what, but that seems very strange to me. ♪♪♪ [Roberts] An athlete dies at a young age. Why? There's some heroin found in his system. Now the question is, did Sonny take drugs? There are innumerous friends of Sonny that would have come forward and did come forward and said, "He would never have shot heroin." He was petrified of needles. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ ♪♪♪ Well, if there's heroin in his system, did somebody else shoot him full of heroin? ♪♪♪ Now we get in, well, if somebody else did, was it murder? ♪♪♪ If it was murder, why did they murder Sonny Liston? [Farrell] Depending on what your point of view is and what your agenda is, that will determine how you feel he was killed. ♪♪♪ I've been told that Liston was killed because of the Wepner fight. The mob lost a lot of money, and I know that it's something that everybody involved would have done. Another person who wanted to see him dead was Red Rodney, who was a cautious criminal. The last thing he wanted to see was Sonny Liston shooting his mouth off about the drug gang that he was running. ♪♪♪ [Rodney] I remembered that my dad and Sonny had a falling out somehow. My dad was real pissed. So, you know, I asked him, I said, "Did you have anything to do with that? Or do you know about that?" And he goes, "No." That's that. But he left town a couple of days later because he knew the cops would be coming around. But I don't think he had anything to do with that. I really don't. ♪♪♪ [Assael] There is a theory-- a extremely persuasive one. A former police informant walks into the Vegas Metro Police Department with a story about a hero cop who broke bad. The very first thing he said was, "That cop killed Sonny Liston." ♪♪♪ This informant said Ash Resnick wanted Sonny dead. Ash hired the cop to kill Sonny Liston. The more he talks, the more detail he gives. ♪♪♪ The investigators didn't want to believe him because it was the guy that they all considered a hero cop. It was Larry Gandy. ♪♪♪ Killing people really does something to you. And it scars you for life. It made me sick that somebody would accuse me of killing somebody for hire. I am not a contract killer. And never would be. ♪♪♪ I sought out Larry Gandy who was the man who was supposedly the hitman on my father's behalf. And he said he'd never met my father. I don't believe that my father was capable of hurting anyone. Especially someone he revered as much as he loved Sonny. [Gandy] I think Sonny Liston was killed because of the raid that went bad on Earl Cage's house. He had motive, opportunity, and means. ♪♪♪ Rumor, rumor, rumor, story, story, story. That's the story of Sonny's life. ♪♪♪ [Assael] The medical examiner just figured natural causes was the easiest way to just end it. And that's what happened. There was no homicide investigation. Sonny's death was Sonny's death. He was given a funeral, a send-off, with a procession up the Las Vegas strip. Dead and buried. ♪♪♪ I don't know. I really don't know whether Sonny, um, overdosed or was murdered. It's much easier to deal with the idea that there were, you know, powerful forces that finally did in this powerful man. I think that's easier than just saying, "Hey, you know, we're-- we're all complicit in the Sonny Liston story." ♪♪♪ [Jeffries] I think there's enough culpability to go around. ♪♪♪ America is responsible, not just white America but black America as a whole for really shaping the life and determining to a certain extent the fortune and fate of Sonny Liston. ♪♪♪ [Izenberg] And the people on the sidelines can say, "Well, he should have changed after this. He should have changed." Nobody tried to hitch me up to a mule in Arkansas when I was 11 years old. Nobody had me hitchhike all the way to St. Louis to meet my sister and mother who I hadn't seen in three years. And nobody said, "How else can I make a living?" So this is who he was, and this is what he was. ♪♪♪ [Jeffries] I don't think it's a wonder that he died when he did. I think it's a wonder that he didn't die earlier. I don't think it's a wonder that he didn't hold on to the championship longer than he did. I think it's a wonder that he made it that far to hold it at all. ♪♪♪ [Majeski] Sonny Liston's fate was sealed in the womb. He reached the stars, and when he grabbed the star, it burnt him up. There was nothing left in Liston to give. ♪♪♪ [Tyson] Sonny Liston should be remembered as a great fighter. Once he's champ, he's always champ. That's always gonna be his identity. People will always call him champ. ♪♪♪ [Reddish Jr.] Charles Sonny Liston. ♪♪♪ He was a man amongst men. ♪♪♪ And that's the story. ♪♪♪ I tell the world, "I'm glad he came through my way one time." ♪♪♪
