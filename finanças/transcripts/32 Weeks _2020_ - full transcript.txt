Is this Hannah? - Yes. - [Caller] Hi, you were listed as a roommate for Cole Hunter. - Yeah, we used to be roommates. What's going on? - [Caller] She's been in an accident. - Okay, I'll be right there. (monitor beeping) (liquid dripping) (soft emotional music) (Hannah sniffles) - Are you Hannah? Are you the next of kin? - What? - Are there any parents, brothers, or sisters? She had a bad concussion last night. Any short-term memory has been affected. She doesn't remember anything about the car accident at all. - Car accident? - Right now we're not sure how bad her memory loss is. - Like, she might not remember who I am? - How long have you known each other? - We met when she first moved to LA almost a year ago. - Oh, (sighs) well. Do you mind stickin' around? - Of course. Whatever I can do to help. (soft melancholy music) (sirens wailing) - [Man] Dr. Clay Collins, report to the ER. Dr. Clay Collins, report to the ER. - Hannah? - Hi. - (gasps) Hi. Oh my god. - I just got done crying. You have to give me a minute. (Hannah sobs) - [Hannah] Don't do that to me. - Okay. I think you're sitting on my fluids. - Oh, I'm sorry. (Cole sighs) Do you remember anything about last night? - I don't remember being in a car accident. - What about the party? You don't remember Josh's party? - Who's Josh? (Hannah gasps) Shit. (Hannah mutters softly) - It's okay, Cole. What was the last thing you remember? - I remember giving a violin lesson. But I don't know what day it was. (knuckles knocking) - Just here to get a little bit of blood. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hi, sweetie. How are you today? - How long has she known Josh? (thud echoing) (bright gentle music) (tones jangling) (distorted chatter warbling) - Hi, I'm Simon. I was wondering if I could buy you a beer. - Uh, there's no bar here. - No, there is not, but there is a stuffed animal that I could win you. How about that? - Yes. Yes, you can. - Yeah? - Yes. - Sure. - All right. - Yeah. - All right. What would you like? (lighthearted music) - Hi. I'm Josh. - Can you catch it in your mouth? (Cole laughs) (lighthearted music swells) (upbeat energetic music) - Just get, so we can get the Ferris wheel. Ready? - Oh! - Oh! Ah! (camera shutter clicks) - I look valuable, you know? - (laughs) You look so valuable. - I got it! - I know! (Simon speaking indistinctly) (energetic music continues) ♪ She's tough ♪ - He's cute. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, he's confident. No one's ever asked to buy me a drink, let alone a stuffed animal. That's like, so cute. (Cole laughs) (images whooshing) - What's your favorite food? - Thai food. - Favorite color? - Green. What was the name of your childhood stuffed animal? - Mr. Stripes. - Zebra? - No. (Cole scoffs) He was a tiger. - Oh. That also makes sense. - I actually still have him. - Do you? - He's got one eye. - Really? - Yeah. He's a little messed up now. He's seen a lot. He's been through a lot. - With the one eye, though. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, you know, when I grew up, I had a lazy eye, so I had to wear an eye patch, and my mom put an eye patch on him, too, to make me feel better, but it wasn't enough, so I ripped his eye out. - Gruesome, one. And two, are you serious? Your joking level and your serious demeanor- - No. (laughs) - are, like, so intertwined. I'll learn. I'll learn. - It's charming, right? - I guess now it's out there, so... So were you, like, a pirate for Halloween all the time? - Haven't heard that one before. - I'm sorry. (bright music) (images whooshing) (numbers clang) (bright music swells) (images whooshing) (memories jangling) (images whooshing) (tones jangling) So this is kind of my secret spot. - [Cole] Wow, it's beautiful. - So are you. - (laughs) You don't have to try that hard. I mean, I... The view's enough, but thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (Cole laughs) - [Simon] I've seen the notebook one too many times. - [Cole] I think so. It's a good movie. - [Simon] Yeah. (images whooshing) (bright upbeat music continues) (images whooshing) (image whooshes) (text creaks) (clock ticks) (cellphone chimes) (switch clicks) (machine whirs) (soft music) (patrons chattering) - I was gonna ask you what happened. - We went back to my house, and, you know, after an hour, she left. - Were you drinking? - Maybe like one drink, you know. We weren't drunk. - Did you text her? - Yes, Hannah, I texted her. She didn't respond. Don't look at me like I did something wrong. Like, do you want me to call the cops because she doesn't respond to a text of mine? Look, the... I wanna see her. - She won't remember you. - Maybe it will help, maybe, you know, maybe I'll jog her memory or something. Please. (person speaking distantly) - Is it weird that I don't wanna meet him? - Well, he might jog your memory. That's the only reason I brought it up. - Okay. Is he cute? (Hannah vocalizes uncertainty) - He's in the waiting room. So you could just see for yourself. - Whoa. - Yeah. - But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I see a picture of him first? - Actually, it's so much more fun if I just bring him in, so I'm gonna bring him in. - Hannah. Hannah! (Cole sighs) (knuckles knocking softly) - Cole? Hey. Hey. Um, sorry, I... - No, um, I'm sorry, I just heard about you like two minutes ago, so... - Text me if you need me, all right. - She's been really great throughout this. Um, I know this has to be super weird, I just... Right, yeah, I just, I'm really glad you're okay, and I wanted to come see you. Yeah, so, you don't remember me at all? Like, nothin'? - Doctor said not to expect any miracles. - Right. Yeah, no, of course. - But I'm not givin' up. - Good. I just want you to know that I'm here for you as much as you need me to be, or not to be, you know. If you want me to leave, I'll leave. And if, you know, you want me to stay, I'll stay. I just, I really care about helping, so I'll do whatever I can. - You really are nice. (Simon laughs) - I think this is just kind of messin' with me, too, you know? - So I think next I meet with the neurologist, and we work on some short-term memory stuff. - Okay. What is the last thing you remember? - Playing the violin, but it's definitely blurry. - I mean, you love the violin, so at least it's a good memory. - Yeah. - Can I, like, give you my number or something? Like, I'd... - Um. (clears throat) - I don't know what to do. - Let me see if I have you in my phone under Simon. Hmm. Is your last name Cute? - Uh, no. I think it's, uh, it's Simon Handsome. - Don't push it. - You're right. We'll just compromise for Simon Adorable. (Cole laughs) - I'm sorry. Who are you? - What? - No. I'm just messing with you. - Jesus Christ. (Cole laughs) - That is, that is not funny. I'm over here tryin' to help. (gentle optimistic music) - [Doctor] Breathe in. And out. Breathe in. And then out. - D, E, F, P, O, T, E, C. - I'm Dr. Caldwell. It's so nice to meet you. - Okay, I need you to look up, and then down, and straight forward. Now we're gonna go to the next one. Look up. Look down. Straight forward. All right, Cole. - So we're going to test your recall today. - [Cole] Okay. - What did I just say? - We're going to test my recall today. - Oh, you're off to a good start. (Cole laughs) - Okay, well, Cole, you just need to keep your schedule with your neurologist, and you'll be fine. (Cole sighs) - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. (bright hopeful music) - So are you sure you don't want me to move back in? Because I can do that if you want. - You don't have to do that. - But I want to do that, you know. I would do that for you. - Doctor said it's best if I just get back to normal behavior as soon as possible. - Oh, so you do remember that I was a messy roommate. - Yes. Yes, I remember that. I could not forget that. - That's a shame. (Cole laughs) Go sit down. Take a seat. - Okay. - Relax. And I am going to fix your face. - Oh, thank you. - You are welcome. - You're so nice. - Well, you know, it looks really bad. (Cole scoffs) - Okay, you could be a little delicate. - Don't be such a baby. - (laughs) You're terrible. - Okay. (Hannah laughs) See, you won't even remember that you had a bruise. - Nope, I won't remember. - No, 'cause you're beautiful again. - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you. - (gasps) Yay. (Cole laughs) - Okay. - Mm, call me. - I will. I promise. - Okay. In like an hour, though. - Okay, I will. - [Hannah] I'm gonna time you. - Okay. - Okay, bye. - Bye. (Cole scoffs) (gentle melancholy music) (Cole sniffling) - You only just got home, you know. - I was just hoping something would make sense. - There isn't any rush. Have you tried social media? A lot of my patients have had luck going through their friend list and finding recognizable faces. Have you spoken with Simon? Couldn't hurt. What about your mutual friends? (soft music) (patrons chattering) - You should just ask him. - I don't know. You know, I know nothing about him, and he knows everything about me, or at least a lot. - So? We're trying to find out just how much he knows. - I guess so. I don't know. - I mean, he's seen you naked. - See, that's weird. That's what I'm talking about. That's weird. (Hannah squeals) Dang it. - He kept coming back for more so I guess he liked it. - Oh my god. You're making it worse. (Hannah laughs) - I don't know, I mean, you get to be with the same person for the first time... No. - Twice. - Stop. You are not... Twice. - You're not helping. (Hannah purrs) - I hate you. (Hannah laughs) You're the worst. - Okay, fine. What else did the psychologist say? - Neurologist. That I should start looking through my Facebook friends. - Oh, yeah. I could have told you that. - All right. Well, what else has been going on? - I don't know. We're both broke. We're both boy-crazy. - Hmm. - Okay, fine. I'm boy-crazy. - I forgot how bad you were at pool. - (laughs) How could you forget that? I mean, what do you want from me, like, current events? - Yeah. I don't know, anything. - (sighs) I mean, I guess you started giving violin lessons. - How's that going? - Well, for me, it's been great. You take me to the movies. You buy me drinks. And you were talking about buying me a house. - Oh, I was? - Yeah, you don't remember that? That's really weird. - Slipped my mind. - (laughs) I wonder why. Okay, but you should really call Simon. - (sighs) What if he doesn't wanna talk to me? What if this is just an easy way out for him? - Mm, if you don't call him, I will. (crickets chirping) (gentle music) (moves to pensive music) (waves crashing) (soft peaceful music) - [Cole] So you like art. - We like art. And I don't know, hanging out with you, so. - Well, I like that. - Good. (Cole laughs) You do like art, right? Yeah? Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, yeah. - Yes. Yes. I do. - Okay, good. - I do. - I just miss hangin' out with you. - Well, maybe if we just kind of hang out and do normal things, like we used to do when things were normal, it would help. - Yeah. I can do that. (chuckles) (Cole laughs) - You know, it's weird how I look at these paintings, and they look so familiar, but we've never been here before, have we? - [Simon] No, not to this gallery. - But, I mean, a painting can still look familiar even if you haven't seen it before, right? - Yeah, definitely, especially with some of these that have more than one image in 'em, you know. - Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I'm just confusing myself even more. - Maybe don't try so hard. - Maybe you're right. - I just mean, like, if you lose your keys, you know, it's like, if you look for them everywhere, you're never gonna find them. You know, it's like nothing happens. You just keep looking over and over. - But you have to look for something if you lose it in order to find it. - Yeah, but that's kind of what we're doing right now. We're looking at a bunch of different things, and then eventually you're gonna find 'em. - Hmm. - [Simon] I don't know. Where's the last place you saw them? (gentle hopeful music) - Maybe this was a bad idea. - I mean, it's your call. I'm just saying, he's a good dude, so, I don't know, I think it's worth giving it a shot. - And Josh's place was where I was the night that- - Yes. If this is weird, like if you don't wanna do this, or you're uncomfortable or something, we don't have to go. We can do somethin' else, it's, honestly, it's not a I guess deal. - It's not like I have a bad memory of the place. - You better watch yourself, Cole. You're, uh, dangerously close to making memory jokes. (Simon laughs) - You did tell him that we were coming, right? - Yeah, of course. (knuckles knocking) - Hey. I didn't know you were coming. All right. Hi. You guys came just in time. I'm excited. - [Simon] What's up? - [Josh] Oh, you remember my roommate, Carrie, right? - What's up? - Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. - No, it's... That wasn't a test or anything, I promise. - No, it's, it's... Thanks. - No, I'm good. - What? (laughs) This is adorable. It's like you two are getting to know each other all over again. (laughs) - (sputters) Oh, shit! (coughs) You're the girl in the coma? - Yeah. (Carrie laughs) - Really, Carrie? - Sorry there's not more people here for the ambiance, but, um... Oh, probably the same food spread, hmm. Help yourself. So what's goin' on? - We're kind of, like, backtracking. - Oh. Okay, yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Cool. Um. (blows air) Oh, Mike and John were in the back playin' vodka pong. You remember that? - Vodka pong? - [Josh] Yeah, you remember, Mike threw up all over John's coat? - [Carrie] (laughs) No. - Oh, oh, yeah. Carrie is definitely doing what she was doing, so, pretty normal. Any of this helping? - No. It's okay, though. Thank you, guys. - Wait. - Yeah, thanks. - You don't... Do you... We're gonna go. Oh, no. I'm okay. - You sure? - Yes. - Uh, I'll text you, dude. - Text me? Is he mad at me? - I just don't think she remembers that she doesn't like you. (laughs) - Uh, I am really sorry about that. That was awful. - No, it's okay. They, um... They seem nice. - Uh, Josh is nice, and Carrie is a pothead. - Yes. - Wow. - Yeah. Yes, she is. Anyway, (sighs) thanks. I like your idea about backtracking and finding my keys and, you know. - Hopefully it works better next time? - Yes. - So we can do it again? - Yes. - Okay. (Cole laughs) Don't go and forget about me, all right? - I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. - Yeah, please do. Just, the hug was the last thing. Bye, Cole. (soft music) (Cole sighs) - [Dr. Caldwell] Well, I think this is great, Cole. - [Cole] I didn't really remember anything. - Well, I like your finding-your-keys analogy. - Is it okay if I just don't remember anything? - What do you mean? - (sighs) I mean, what if I just make peace with it, and I move on? - Now, why would you wanna do that? - I feel like everything's going fine right now, and I shouldn't mess with it. - Cole, I understand you're afraid. But I'm going to feel a lot better if I know that all of your cognitive functions are firing on all cylinders. - Okay. - You don't really feel that way, do you? - I guess not. - Well, then how is it that you really feel? - Like I don't know myself at all, and I won't know myself until I can remember. - One day at a time. And I want you to start playing music again. (Cole sighs) (gentle violin music) (note shrieks) (waves crashing) (violin music darkens) (children laughing distantly) (moves to ominous music) (clang echoes) (bow squeaks) - [Simon] Hey. - Hey, have we ever been to Point Dune? - [Simon] Yeah, we've been. - [Cole] Can you take me there? - [Simon] Sure. When do you wanna go? - Now. - Okay. Yeah, I'll come pick you up. (waves crashing) You want me to tell you what we did here? - No. No. - Okay. So let me get this right. You were just playing the violin, and you saw these images flash of us here? - I can see it, you know, and it, it, it doesn't feel real, it feels like a dream, but you're saying it is real and... I don't know, Dr. Caldwell was saying that I should be listening and playing more music. Was I nice? - Yeah. What, really? That's what you're worried about? Of course you were nice. Why would you ask that? - You're just really nice, and I would feel really bad if I wasn't nice. - You were very nice. You are very nice, both past and present. I promise. - Good. - Do you wanna go to our favorite restaurant? - We have a favorite restaurant? - Yes, we do. And we should go. I'm gonna make the executive decision here. We're gonna go. - Okay. - Yeah? All right? I'm tellin' you. - Okay. - It's gonna work. (Cole laughs) - This is my favorite restaurant? - Our favorite restaurant, yeah. - It's a truck. How long were we dating? - Uh, like six weeks. - Yeah, maybe I just didn't have the courage to tell you that, um, I don't eating at places that don't have a quality rating, so. - I mean, that's fine, 'cause this place is actually, it's an A-plus. - An A-plus? - A-plus-plus, yeah. - Well, that's funny, 'cause I don't see a sign. Or a door. Actually, I don't see a ceiling either. - Yeah. No, I mean, this is the same thing you said the first time, so please, I mean... Oh, really? - Yeah, go on. - All right, well, fine. I'm up for something new. - Okay. - Again. - Jose, what up, buddy? We're gonna do the usual, the two chicharron, one asada and one chorizo. (mellow lighthearted music) Jose, buddy, much appreciated. - Thank you very much. Which one do I do first? - Blind taste test, but I would say the only thing is eat quick, because I will eat all of them, immediately. Two chicharron, chorizo, asada, all of those (indistinct). - All right, well, which should I start with? - Chicharron. Jose turned me on to it. Never looked back. - I know, but just, it looks- - Don't but just. You're gonna make me make another memory joke, and I really just want to. So just do it. - No way. I also don't want that. All right. I'm gonna try it. Oh my god. - Just give me a moment. - It's delicious. - Yep. - Why can't they put, like, a restaurant around this truck? - Because it makes the tacos cheap, which means we can do things like this. Jose! Four more. - (sighs) Well, you win, all right. I admit it. Those were delicious tacos. (both laugh) All right. Well, goodnight, Simon Long. - But still handsome? - (chuckles) Sure. - Okay. (gentle pensive music) (patrons chattering softly) - Why didn't you tell me about him? - [Hannah] It didn't end well. - So? I asked you what I'd been doing. - Look, I would just drop it if I were you. - Why? - Because it didn't work the first time. Why are you trying to tempt the universe? - I'm not trying to date the guy. I just think that maybe he would help me remember something. - [Hannah] Like what, bad memories? - It's not up to you. - Okay, I just think that, you know, there are plenty of guys I'd rather not remember, and maybe something good could happen after we... Good? - Yes. - Something good? - Yeah. - I just need people to be honest with me. Okay? - Okay, I'm sorry. Are you gonna call him? - Depends on what happened. - (sighs) There was someone else. - Oh. - [Hannah] Yeah. There was a lot of fighting and a lot of crying, and at the end, you really weren't happy. - Mm-hmm, okay. - What do you want to do? - [Cole] I don't know. I'm sorry I snapped at you. - Yeah, it's cool. - How many of those have you had? - Mm, I don't know, you know. But it is bottomless mimosas. It's just, you're not supposed to count them. That's kind of the whole point of bottomless mimosas. - [Cole] You're right. You're right. (glasses clink) (Cole laughs) - Bottoms up, darlin'. Don't be mad at me again. (quiet suspenseful music) (cellphone chimes) (uneasy violin music) (moves to soft dreamy music) (note shrieks) (riders shouting) (child laughing distantly) - [Cole] That's how you play. (memories whooshing) (Cole speaking indistinctly) (Cole laughing) (soft music swells) (note screeches) - [TV Commentator] Late into the quarter. (cellphone ringing) But they've had a lot of success with the shotgun formation, Brian. (remote clicks) - Hey. - [Cole] Can I come over? - Yeah. Sure. - [Cole] Where do you live? (Simon laughs) (knuckles knocking) (Simon sighs) - Hey. - Sorry. I thought it would help. (clears throat) - Uh. Did it? Sadly, I have gotten worse reactions. - Did we ever talk about exes? - Ex-boyfriends? - [Cole] Mm-hmm. - Not extensively. Why? - Someone reached out. - Oh. Do you remember them? So it's someone fairly recent. - I guess so. (sighs) - [Simon] Um, what are you gonna do? - What do you think I should do? - (laughs) I think I'm definitely the wrong person to ask. That's for sure. (Cole sighs) I can give you the selfish answer, but that's not really right. - [Cole] Can you take me somewhere that we've been before? - [Simon] Yeah. You wanna go right now? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Yeah, let's do it. - Good call. I like this place. - I'm sorry. What? You like this place? - Yes. - You told me you had never been here before. - Oops, I... - Oops, that's... Huh, Oops. (Cole laughs) Oh man, we are so even. You call me a liar all the time and- - Well, this is just a little white lie. - Mm-hmm. - This is not, this is nothing. - Yeah, sure. Okay. - I'm sorry. - Weird. I mean, that we tell white lies, but I get it. - What? To, like, people we're dating? - Yeah. But it's only in the beginning, like you lying... Yeah. - that you haven't been to a record store. - I wonder if we ever stop lying to each other. - I hope so. - I think it's just easy in the beginning of a relationship because it's like a blank slate, you know? I can make you think I'm whoever I want you to think I am. - Like who? - Like someone who's never been here before. - Okay, yes. No, that makes sense. - On another date. - No way. (Cole laughs) - For real? (laughs) Wow. Okay. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm just trying to be honest, you know. - Yeah, yeah. - Keep it going. - Okay. - Keep it helpin' with my memory. I'm sorry. (Cole sighs) - Hey, Cole? - Yes? - I've been here on another date too. - (gasps) Are you kidding me? - I wish I was, but no, I actually have been here on another date. I am so sorry. - You're... Yeah. - I guess we're both sorry. - We're both sorry? 'Cause I feel like this is weird. - It's definitely- - You're staring at me. - Made it even worse. - I'm uncomfortable. - This is terrible. - Should I go in another section? - Just leave. - Okay. - I mean, but (Simon sighs) let's think about it. - Okay. - In context. - Yes. - This date goes so much smoother if we walk in here and I'm like, wow, I've never been here before. This is the coolest place I have ever been. Is this a record store? You're so neat and retro. - Ooh. - And you're my knight in shining armor (cellphone ringing) and my hero for showing me this cool spot, this cool record store that I've never been to. - Okay, as much as, like, the whole brutal honesty thing seems amazing, and I really wanna do that, I'm gonna- - I can entertain myself. - You sure, 'cause I'm gonna- - If I'm being honest. - Yeah? Hey, Josh. Oh, no, you're not interrupting anything at all. Yes. (soft indie music) (artist singing indistinctly) (light orchestral music) (static roaring) (curious music) - [Cole] Yeah, well you've gotta- (Hannah laughing) (waves crashing) (discordant notes shrieking) (Cole panting) (soft indie music) (artist singing indistinctly) - Hey. - Hey. - Are you okay? - Um, yeah. Yeah. - Um, I actually have to run. I'm sorry, but- - No, it's, that's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's totally, yeah. - [Simon] All right, you're sure you're okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - Thank you again. - Yeah, of course. Um, Josh invited us over tonight. He's having some people over, and there'll be some familiar faces. - Okay. - [Simon] Will you go? - Sure. - [Simon] Promise? - I promise. - [Simon] Honesty? - Honesty. - All right, um, bye, Cole. - [Cole] Bye. (bright romantic music) (tires screeching) (record scratches) (Cole gasps) - [Store Clerk] Hey, you okay? - Uh, yeah. - You gonna pay for that? - Yeah. Sorry. (Cole breathes heavily) (message whooshes) (Warren clears throat) (Warren laughs) - Uh, sorry. - Hi. - Hi. Can I hug you? Is that weird? - Everything's pretty weird right now. - Yeah. - Sure. - Thanks. I needed that. - [Cole] You smell good. - Thank you. - Familiar, I think. - That's good, right? - Take what I can get. - You wanna sit? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Um, so basically what I'm doing right now is just meeting with people that I might've known before that I don't really remember now, see if I can jog any memories. Doctor's orders. - Of course. - How's all that going? - It's okay. Actually, what's been really helpful has been listening to music. - Cool. - Sometimes. It can get a little weird. Like today, it was actually mostly about you. - I see. - Thought it was a good time to get together. - Sure. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. - Why did we break up? - Is this sparkin' any memories? 'Cause it's very much like a lot of the conversations we have. - I just went through our texts, and they weren't very clear, and all of the memories I have are good, so. - That's 'cause we mainly have good memories. - So what was it? - Can we just not talk about it? I'm sorry, just, no matter what I say, it's just my side of the story. And that's not really fair, right? You okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's just, it can be kind of hard. - Is there anything that I can do to help? - Is there anything that you can tell me? - I like you very much. And I still care about you. I still don't feel like I'm helpin'. - (scoffs) That's okay. I'm just gonna have to listen to more music.

I don't know even know what happened. Josh isn't even that cute, he's just, like, so persistent. - Okay, relax. It's fine. What's the story? How'd it happen? - Oh my god, I don't know, it just... I guess we just bonded in the middle of all this drama. You know what I mean. - Yeah. No, I'm happy for you. - Thank you. - So I, um, I saw Warren today. - Oh, how did that go? - Well. It went well. - That's good. How are things with Simon? - [Cole] Good. - Good. - Um, I started to remember some things. - Oh my god, that's so good. - Yeah, it's just in, like, quick spurts and only when I listen to music, but... - That's great. That's not great? - [Cole] I don't know, uh, I started to remember parts of the crash. - Oh shit. - Yeah. - Well, it's nothing a little vino can't cure. (Cole laughs) - Cheers to that. - To Josh and to Simon, and to Warren, and to surviving car accidents. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - To surviving care accidents. - That's it. That's all. (funky upbeat music) ♪ Somewhere on the scene ♪ ♪ Got a little longer ♪ - Josh, is it weird that you and Hannah are dating? - (scoffs) Only for you. Ooh. - She hasn't, like, said anything, has she? - Dude, you know if she ever said anything that might help with your relationship, I would definitely not tell you. She didn't tell me anything, all right. - [Carrie] You already put a card down, dude. - Shit. You won. - Oh. (laughs) - Why'd you tell him? - Is this coma girl? - Carrie! - Yes, it is. (Carries laughs) - Jesus. - [Hannah] Hey! - Hey, baby. Come 'ere. Mm. Mm. - How long has this been going on? - She's been sleeping here for like the last week. - Yo, don't blow up my spot. - Hey! - Did you know about this? - Vaguely. - Look, if I'm gonna be straight, you guys really did inspire us. Like, anything could happen. (Hannah coos) Anytime. Mm. (Hannah giggles) - I'm guessin' sometimes twice. - Oh, that's sweet. - All right. That's... You want a beer? - [Cole] Sure. - Oh my god, I have the best idea. - Oh, I'm the worst at strip poker. I never wear enough layers. - It'll be a show. - No, no, no, no. We should play never have I ever. - Ooh. - Please. - I don't think that's a great game to play. - Perfect game for someone who was in a coma. - Still with the coma? Yeah? - Okay. - All right, no, because, listen. She could say that she's never done something that we know she's done. It'd be like, um, reverse psychology. (Hannah stifles laughing) - That is definitely not reverse psychology. - Could be fun. - Oh? - Thank you. - Really? (Carrie laughs) - Maybe, why not? - All right. - Okay. - [Josh] This is gonna get weird. - All right, never have I ever been in a coma. (Josh laughs) - Oh my god, Carrie. Okay. - Never have I ever been skinny dipping. - [Group] Ooh. - Drink up. - (laughs) Drink up. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Tell me more. - For real? - I'm, okay. - Oh. - No. - Yeah. - Yeah. - That's not part of the game. - Yeah. I mean, is there a story to it? - No. - No. That's not how it works. - Maybe some details? - No. - No more details. - Just a detail? (Carrie speaks indistinctly) - Wow. - Or two? - I think it's your turn. - Okay. Never have I ever been arrested. (Cole scoffs) - Hmm. - That's a really weird one. - What? Nobody? - No. I think you. - Mm-hmm. - I don't know. - [Simon] Oh god, don't do a coma thing again. Played out. - Yeah, let's- - Fine, no coma thing. Never have I ever had sex with Simon. - [Cole] Oh. (group vocalizes interest) (Josh laughs) - Those lonely nights, yeah. (Hannah speaks indistinctly) - So you... It's okay, man. - You give yourself a lot of action? - [Josh] Mm-hmm. - Tell you what, you know. - Hey. - Nothin' like being- - Lonely nights. - 14-year-old teenager. - Or, you know, however old you are now. (group laughing) (light easygoing music) - Ace. - That's a waterfall. - That's a waterfall. - Uh, three, me. - Hey. - All right. - Yes. (Josh clapping) - Mm-hmm. - Can you drink it all? - Chug, chug, chug, chug. - Wow. - All of it. - That is so impressive. - Oh my. - Over right now. - I can still do this. - [Simon] Oh, you remember? - [Hannah] (laughs) Oh, wow. - Sorry. (Carrie sputters) - That was... Let's go pee. - Game over. - Let's pee. - Okay. - Look, look, look, look. Other side, oh. - Get outta here, dude. (group laughing) - We are sharing. - Figure it's over. - Let's pee. - Okay. - [Cole] Come on. - [Hannah] Yeah. - What? - Go, go, go, go. - That is impressive. I am thoroughly impressed. - Get your head outta there. - He's so funny. - He's really funny. - Sometimes too funny, though. - Yeah, I could see that. (Hannah laughs) - Oh shit. Let's look through photos. - Photos of what? - You know, I'll just, like, go through my camera roll, and I will tell you what's happening. - I don't really have that many photos. - Okay, don't worry. I have tons of photos. Oh, look, this is at Don Antonio's. And, okay, they have this old fashioned, but they have crushed ice, and they're doing it wrong. Okay, um. Oh, down you remember that time we went to Street Food Cinema? - Yes. - And we saw "Back to the Future"? - Maybe. - Okay. - Oh. - What? - I was scrolling through Warren's Facebook earlier, and he had so many pictures of me on it, but I don't have any pictures of him. - I would assume that you deleted them all. - Was it that bad? Noted. What is this? - Oh, that is the first night that you and Simon met. - This is the first night we met? - Yeah. - Look so comfortable. - Yeah, you hit it off immediately. (tense eerie music builds) - Um. (clears throat) - Is everything okay? - I think the beer hit me. - What is wrong with the two- - Shocker. - She might even lick it. - Cole? Hey, Cole. Cole. Cole. Hey, Cole. - I have to go. - Would you stop. Would you stop. - Is this Warren? - Who? - Stop lying to me. Why is he there? - He's a stalker. - What? - Yeah. Warren's a stalker Cole, okay. It was a really shitty start for us, so I didn't tell you. - You didn't think that maybe that was something important for me to know? - I'm, I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, that's really selfish, Simon. I can't remember. You can't just change the past so it suits you. - I, I didn't wanna- - (scoffs) Oh god. - Cole. - Just don't follow me. (Simon sighs) (cellphone chimes) (Cole sniffles) Yeah. (light orchestral music) (orchestral music intensifies) (thud echoing) (memories whooshing) (distant voices chattering) (Cole shouting indistinctly) (Hannah and Cole speaking indistinctly) (orchestral music swells) (glass clinking) (tires screeching) (Cole gasping) (thud echoes) (eerie note shrieks) (distant alarm wailing) (car alarm beeps off) (crickets chirping) (waves crashing) (cellphone chimes) So there's a couple different parts to the bow. And this here, this is called the frog, okay. And it kind of looks like a frog. - Uh-huh. - All right. So you wanna take hold of the bow and give it a shot? - Sure. - Got it? Very good. Awesome. Okay, remember, just try and keep the bow as straight as possible, and you can do long bows if you can. All right? (wobbly violin music) - Nope. - No, you're okay. You can leave it there, but just try and keep it- - Okay. - in the same spot. (slow violin music) Yeah. That's great. That's so good. (laughs) - [Girl] It sounded pretty bad. - No, that's great. It's really hard to stay, like, on the one string, but you balanced it, I think, really well. You're a professional. (laughs) - I know that some of these memories are unpleasant, Cole, but that's the way of life. But your brain is finally working like it's supposed to be working. - I'm just having a little trouble with my support system right now. - [Dr. Caldwell] Well, I'm sure it isn't easy for them either. - I guess not. - When the memories come, are they random? - Sort of. If I'm thinking of someone or something, or if I get some new real information, I sort of, I sort of start to remember as if I were dreaming. - Do you think that when you're playing your violin, you might only be thinking of things that you want to remember? (bell dings) (patrons chattering faintly) (thud echoes) - Warren? - Cole. Hi. - [Cole] What are you doing here? - Work. I work up the street. - Oh. Were you just looking in the window? - Yeah, here? Oh. Oh, I forgot lunch, so I was just seein' if they had anything I could grab quickly. - Hmm. - Yeah. Oh, were you in there? - Yeah. Yeah. You just startled me. - Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Um, I gotta get to- - Work, right. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - It's, uh, it's good to see you, though. - You too. - And, um, I don't know, text me, or I'll text you. - Okay. Bye. (low tense music) (tense music builds) (knuckles knocking loudly) - You aren't answering any of my calls. - I just kind of needed a break. - Can I explain? - What else is there to explain? I mean, Simon's a liar. Warren's a stalker. Now you're a stalker too? - Wait. What? - [Cole] Simon told me everything, okay. I just wish you would have. - Simon told you what? - The picture you showed me? Warren was in it. - You invited Warren that night. - What? I, I don't understand. When did I meet Warren? (thud echoing) (memories whooshing) (numbers ticking) - Hi. I'm Warren. - Bold move. - Not really. I was just sittin' over there for like 20 minutes, tryin' to think of ways to come talk to you. (chuckles) - I'm Cole. It took me like 20 seconds to come up with that. - You are movin' way too fast for me. - (laughs) I've, uh, I've heard that before. - Can I join you or... - Um. Sure. It's not like I was doing anything. - Think I'm gonna join you despite all the reasons I shouldn't. - Oh, really? Do tell. - You are too snarky. (clang echoes) Too smart for me. (energy whooshing) You're a wonderful cook. - [Cole] Thank you. I spent a really long time on this. (Warren laughs) (numbers rattling) - Hey, can we switch spots? - Want to? - Can you switch me? - Yes. - Hmm? - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Cole laughs) Oh, wow. Oh. - Do you like it? - This is nice. - You like it this way? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm? - Yeah. (ball clacking) I beat ya. (Cole laughs) Your eyes are too far apart. (numbers clanging) Your eyes are too close together. (numbers rumbling) I can't stop thinking about you. (scene whooshing) (bright lighthearted music) (number whizzing) I can't stop thinking about us. (bright music continues) (scenes whooshing) - I wanna just take it slow. Is that okay? (numbers ticking) I wish you would take this more serious. (numbers ticking) I wish you wouldn't take everything so seriously. (numbers ticking) I think we should see other people. (number rattles) - Can we still be friends? - I'd like that. (number rattles) How could you already be seeing someone else? - I thought you said you wanted to be friends. - So I can see people, too, then? - Yeah, you're the one that said you wanted to see other people. - Well, me I was just scared. (scenes whooshing) (numbers ticking) Well, I'd still like to hang out. - Yeah, I'd like that. - I'm going to the pier tomorrow night with Hannah, if you wanna come. - I was wondering if I could buy you a beer? (rides rattling) (crowd chattering) - Oh! Ah! - He's cute. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, he's confident. No one's ever asked to buy me a drink, let alone a stuffed animal. It's like, so cute. (Cole laughs) What is he doing here? (numbers clanging) - I think I'm in love with Warren. - Oh shit. (Cole gasps) Wait. Where are you going? - I have to tell him. - [Hannah] Oh, can I watch? - (sighs) Wait, I should, I should tell Simon first. - You can do that one alone. - Thank you. Wish me luck. - Yes, go.

Yeah. - [Doctor] I wanted to let you know, we got your toxicology report back. - My what? - [Doctor] Any time there's a car accident, we're legally obligated to do a toxicology report. - Okay. - [Doctor] Cole, you had an unusual amount of ketamine on your bloodstream. - What? - [Doctor] It's commonly used for chronic pain or sedation in intensive care. - Okay. Is everything okay. - [Doctor] Cole, I'm sorry. I don't think I'm being clear. We didn't give you any ketamine. - I don't understood. - [Doctor] It's commonly used for date rape. Cole, I know this is probably a surprise to you, but I think it explains how and why you got into a car accident. Now, we're going to need to run a couple more tests immediately, and it's also the right time for you to call the police. I wanna do any MRI today. I need to check on scheduling.

(tense music) - I have to go. - [Doctor] Cole, are you still there? - Help! I'm at 1313 Montana, unit 4! - Shit. Why would you do that? Cole? (suspenseful music builds) (door clicks) Cole? Are you looking for your phone? (keys jangle) (lock rattles) Cole. Hey. Hey, I, I just wanna talk, okay? - Just let me go. - I'm not gonna hurt you. Look, I'm just gonna shut the door. Your phone, my keys. Okay? Just gonna talk. I just wanna, I wanna explain the situation. All right? First, you gotta know, I never meant to hurt you, Cole. - [Cole] You drugged me. - I am so sorry you got hurt. Honestly. I didn't know what to do. Okay? (sniffles) I panicked, I freaked out, and I, I'm sorry, I didn't... I wasn't thinking. You know how sorry I am? I know I messed up. I wish I could take it back, I... It happened so fast. I didn't know if you were alive or dead, I mean... (sniffles) Seeing you there in the car, I freaked out. I thought you were dead. I thought I killed you. I made the wrong choice. And I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry. This isn't what I wanted. You gotta believe me on that. I just wanted to help. I just wanted us to be together. But then, you know, Warren came around. And, um, I just, I did what I had to to help you, you know? You can see that, right? I did what I had to to help you so you wouldn't fall back into your old ways and get hurt again. This was all for you. Now, I know that the police are gonna come, okay. So, so I'm gonna go willingly. All right? But you can take as much time as you need here.
