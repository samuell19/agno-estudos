Can I help you? Uh, she order yet? Are you stupid? Sometimes she orders early. It's Thursday. She orders on Fridays. Just checking. You won't be getting her anyway. What do you mean? I mean, you're not getting her. - Merrick claimed her. - What? Hey, don't pout in my personal space. Take it up with Merrick. - Yeah, if you say so. - No, no, no, no. Yeah, what? So, what. Bianca! Hey, Fing, how are you? I'm fantastic! How are you? - What? - Bianca said you wanted her delivery. Did you take it? Who delivery? Magda's. Yeah, I did. You got a problem with that? Usually, I take her. That's why I took her because I figured it's my turn. She doesn't want--! Oh, I see. She wants you to deliver the pizza, huh? You like this girl, do ya? Yeah. What would you give up for her? - What do you want? - Four Four of yours this week. That's not really fair, Merrick. No, it's not fair, but I'm the boss and that's the way it works. - Fine. - Right. Alright, on top of that, new guy. - Geez! - Don't do that. All right. He's going to shadow you tonight, and he's going to shadow you tomorrow. - Yeah? - Okay. And you can deliver your pizza. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, man. Rudy. Nice to meet you. Fuck. He left me just hanging there. Go shadow him! You ever had a chick answer the door naked? No. Close, though. I had this really good-looking girl answer the door wearing the tiniest towel, not even big enough to cover all the goods if you know what I mean. Yeah, man. That's what I want. I want that. You know, and then she drops the money. She knows she can't bend over to pick it up without you catching something slip out at either end. You know, but you're a gentleman. You pick it up for her, and you still get a flash of her hoo-ha. You're an ironic gentleman. Oh, come on. That was just an example. Isaac! - Fing! - Hey. Who's your friend? Oh, this is my-- - Rudy. - Rudy. Yeah. It's so good to see both of you guys. Did you hear about the tragedy at the hospital this weekend? - No. - Yeah. I heard about it. That shit's totally preventable, guys. Doesn't need to happen. So what you got going on today, Fing? You got to give it up, buddy, huh? It's in you to give. Blood! There's an emergency blood clinic just a couple blocks from here. What time do you want us there? How about lunchtime? Okie dokie. You're a good man, Ike. Got to protect the community, huh? Why didn't you give him a high five? I don't know. He creeps me out a bit. What? He's like the nicest guy in the world. He's pretty weird. You're weird. What? This is your ride? Yep. Aw, sick, man! Uh-huh! Oh, I just want to... Hey, don't-- don't do that! Don't. Stop. Stop... Don't do that. Guard the car. You're supposed to be training me. I don't hear you guarding. Sick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. One large Hawaiian? Thank God! It's a war zone in here! Give me a second, I can't find my purse. Tristan, have you seen my purse? Don't you mess with me right now! Oh, here. Sorry. Come on in. Yeah. Take your time. Don't panic. Oh, little bastards! Give me my purse! Get back here, Tristan! Come here! Oh, look what you made me do! Hey, let me get my wallet! Ugh! Tristan! God. No! You're not getting any-- here. Ah, will you hold him for a second? - I got to find my money. - Uh-huh. Okay, thanks. Oh, wow. - What's that? - Uh. Come on, guy. What do I owe? Nineteen titty-- fifty. Nineteen fifty. Can I have my baby back? - Oh, sure. - Oh, my God! You pressed your breast into me. My husband's going to hear about this! You did it. What's going on? We got to work on your tough guy. Say, "Do it, you little gay chicken shit!" Do it, gay chicken! Really? With some conviction. Or you're dead, homo! Does it have to be a homosexual slur? Yes. You're the sidekick. You're supposed to listen. I have a lot of gay friends. I had to listen when I was a sidekick. They're really good people. Say whatever you want! Just make sure he listens! Ass face! Okay. Put the jewelry in the bag right now! Or else? Or else I'm going to shoot you with this gun right in the face! That's good. Very scary. Yes. - Thank you. - In the bag. In the bag. Yeah. Quicker. Move it. Yeah. Thank you. Ike. Oh, you came. It's so good to see you, man. Have you ever given blood before? No, never. Even better. Virgin blood! I'm not giving blood. Come on. Let's do this! Let's save a life! - Come on, man. - No, man. I-- I got AIDS. Got it. Right this way, Ike. Hey, there's nothing to be nervous about when giving blood. - I'm fine. - It's heroic. Got a hero here, Jack! Oh, oh, right on. A real-life hero. I like that. You're in good hands pal. Don't you worry about a thing, okay? - Hook the hero up. - No problem. You got it. Come on in, pal. Take a seat. Make yourself comfortable, okay? Okay. So, you ever given blood before? Uh, no. First time. Okay, well how do you know Fing? I live in the same city. He's into everything, isn't he? Sure is. A little over zealous if you ask me. Yeah, you can say that. - So, okay. Nice and easy. - Okay. There you go. Very well done, Ike. You are my hero, indeed. That's it, pal. You're good. Kick back, relax, and I'll be back in just a little bit. - AIDS? - I hate needles? Why'd you make us come here again? You don't understand. If Fing wants you to do something, you just do it or you'll hear about it for the rest of your life. Screw that. I'm going to steal a cookie. What? Get me one. Come on. Right this way. Good luck. - Ready to give some blood? - Yeah. Okay. Right this way. Holy shit! Is he okay? He's just fine. This happens all the time. No problem at all. Just relax. - What's going on? - You're okay, Ike. Just a little hole in the bag. Hold still, please. There you go, buddy. Put a little pressure on that. You got it. Okay, you should be good. Sorry about the mess, and sorry about the bag breaking, but make sure you grab a cookie on the way out. - Okay, pal? - If there's any left. Okay. Thank you. What is it? I won a free trip to China. What? Hey, what contest was this? I don't know. - You ask Magda out yet? - Yep. - You're lying. - What am I going to do in China? What are you not going to do in China? Communicate? Everybody speaks English, Ike. I know a bunch here that don't even speak English good. Besides, I might have plans with Magda. Yeah? What kind of plans? Serious ones. You haven't talked about shit with Magda! Of course not! That's disgusting! Quit being stupid. Take the damn trip! Expand your horizons. Expand your horizons. I'll sell it to you. I can afford a trip to China. You deliver pizzas! And I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. I'm just saying some cultural enhancement might be appealing to someone like Magda. Magda thinks I'm plenty appealing. You're a nice guy, Ike. That doesn't get chicks going. Chicks like confident guys. They like worldly, well-traveled guys. You don't know anything about Magda. I know women. She's not like the women you get. Okay, Ike. Are you going to tell me your secret? No. You're going to buy my trip? - No. - Can I have my breakfast back? Thank you. You don't got lots going on right now. Nothing. You should change that. Just so you know, I'm not cool with this. I'm aware of that. Also, I don't like you anymore. I had no idea you liked me before. Anything else? Yes, actually. I'm just torn about telling you this, though. Why? What is it? Because on the one hand, it could be funny if someone beat you down, and you had no idea it was coming. Why would someone want to beat me? I don't know, Ike. You tell me. Maybe it's because you're out there grabbing titties on your deliveries! What? Someone said that? Why would someone say that, Ike? I don't know. What did she say? He! Douchebag. He. And he also said he plans on bumping into you real soon. Bullshit. What-- what did he sound like? Big. Mean. Thanks, Bianca. You're real swell. You're welcome. Pervert. Whose titties did you grab? It doesn't usually work like that. When will you know? Okay... Yeah. I'll expect your call. Geez. So? You got to give me space when I'm on the phone. Is it a job? Oh, I got you. Okay. It's for you. Thank you very much. Can I get a glass of water for the road, please? I thought you said this would mostly be stealing. Well, it's mostly stealing plus a few other things. I don't think we should do other things. Just steal? - Well, yeah. - Just steal. Couldn't we just shake him around? You've got battery, intent for bodily harm and aggravated assault. I don't think I could do this job. Hey, Brennan, when I started out, I was nervous too. Yeah. Don't worry. You had a good teacher. You can't leave this lying around. - Put that shit away. - Okay. So, are you going to tell me? What? Why this guy wants to kidnap someone? I don't know. What-- what do you mean you don't know? What's up with this guy? Yakkity yack yack. You guys sound like two Marys. I don't mean to be rude, but you I think may have picked up my hundy, okay buddy? Why don't you get out of here? Get out of here? No. I'm telling you I think you may have picked up my hundred-dollar bill. I'm telling you that maybe you saw me pick up something else. Yeah. Okay. Hey, no problem, pal. Okay. So, why are we kidnapping someone? I thought you needed the money. I need the money. I need the money! But I still have my ethics. Okay, all right. I'll tell you what. If he calls back, I'll ask him. Thank you. Okay, listen to me very carefully, okay, dude? I want my money. Do you understand what I’m trying to-- You can ask me one more time. How's that? Huh? Okay. Take the money, man. Yeah. Just keep the money. Ugh! You don't wanna be doing this, okay? Yeah. Ugh! Come here. Sure about that? Thanks, dickhead. - Brennan! - Sorry. I still don't get it, man. How do you drive a car like that? It's none of your business. You know, I'd sleep with you to drive that. Just give me the bag. - Oh! - Snap, man. Why would you do that? Pick it up. You killed the pizza, man. It's dead. It's not my problem. You're late, pig face! That's not my name. Two rodeo classics, four ranch, four cheese. - Is that the pizza? - My God, you are ugly. That's great. That will be $42.69. Hey, bring that pizza in here. Hey, pig face. Who's your boyfriend? Please don't flick garbage in my face. Please don't flick garbage in my boyfriend's face. Hey, I'm hungry. That's super. Aren't you the guy who smashed our last pie? Uh, hmm... That's not accurate. It was you. It was you, pig face. You're the guy. Open the bag. Payment first or I drop it. Give me that! Let it go, moron! Well, cash, credit or debit? You're not getting a tip. Huge surprise. You guys usually tip so well. All right. All right. I got a little something for ya. What the fuck? It burns! Oh! Oh! Dude, I can actually smell his balls on your face right now. I don't want to talk about it! - All right. - Oh, God! So pungent. - You look nervous. - What? It's how I always look. You're really going to ask her out? Of course I'm going to ask her out. Just uh-- One... All right. I have to knock... Don't. Don't touch me. Okay? That's it. Get that angle right. I'm going to do it. All right? I'm going to do it. Don't. I was going to do it! Hi, boys. Oh yeah. One medium Mediterranean subbed goat cheese with-- - Extra sauce. - What's the damage? Uh, 16.50. Here you go and keep the change. - Thank you. - I'm Magda. It's nice to meet you. And there's-- there's your pizza. Oh, lovely. Well, thanks. It was great seeing you. Yeah. - See you. - Oh, bye. Bye. So that's how you ask out a girl? You keep saying that. "I was going to ask her out." You gotta plant the seed. Hey, dickheads! You talking to us? Oh, yeah. I'm talking to both of you dickheads! Yeah, you hit me in the head with your banana peel, pal. Oh, I did? I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Hey, you're that guy from the blood bank, right? Yeah. What the hell? Okay, calm down. This guy just needs a lesson in manners and Sketcher's is just the one to teach it to him. He said he was sorry. Oh, okay! Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt? I'm the guy from the clinic, man! He said he was sorry. Okay. Ugh! This one is going to hurt. - What are you doing? - Get off me! Get off! You're drunk, Jack! Piss off, Fing! I said go home! Understand? Yeah, I understand, man. Hey! This isn't over! Get some sleep. Why don't you get some sleep, man? What's the matter with him? Jack's not a bad guy. He just has a problem with the sauce. Yeah. No kidding. Rudy, are you all right? You all right? It's okay. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. You all right? All right? Better? Yeah. Thanks, Ike. I appreciate it. Don't thank me. We're both lucky Fing showed up. Thanks to both of you. I just don't do too well with getting smacked, right? Of course! That's understandable. With AIDS, you can't risk bleeding. You sure you're okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine, mostly. Still the problem with the heart? Yeah. Dude. You got to ask her out. She's out of my league, man. Are you kidding me? You're a big league hitter. Girl'd be crazy not to get her hands on some Ike. All right. Are you sure everything's still okay? I'm fine. Why do you keep asking? You just don't seem like yourself lately or you don't like me anymore. I like you, Fing. You get a little intense sometimes. But I like you. Intense? How? You know, like you're always asking people to do stuff, bake sales, bottle drives, donor stuff. It's always something, right? What if it was me in the hospital that needed blood or you? I would hope there's lots of blood in the blood bank. And how does that blood get there? - The donors? - Yeah, donors. And how do the orphans get warm blankets at Christmas time? - You gave it to them. - I gave it to them. Hey, would you like a free trip to China? - You won this? - Yeah? No, no, no. I can't take this. No. I want you to have it. Are you seriously going to make me take this? It's for you. For all the hard work you do in the community. No one's ever done anything like this for me before. Well, you-- you deserve it. I know I get really intense sometimes. I just care so much about the community, you know. It's how you roll. And we're better because of it. Okay? Take care, buddy. Hello. Hello, sir. Your pizza has arrived. Pizza? Yeah, your pizza. One large Chicken Tuscany with olives. Chicken? Yeah. Your chicken pizza. You ordered a pizza, didn't you? Oh, now I remember. I'm sorry. Oh, come on, Tom. Get your head screwed on straight. All right, guys. Here's some coins. I don't suppose that's going to cover it, is it? You know what? There's actually a special promo going on today, sir, for people living in this exact address. - A promo? - Yep. Your pizza is absolutely free. - Absolutely free! - That's right. That is wonderful! - Thank you, young man. - Hey. And you too, young fellow. Thank you so much. You come back now, okay? Anytime, and have some pizza. Yeah, sure. Have a good one. Bye! - Okay. - That's how it's done. Why would you give that old coot a free pizza? - He's tricking you. - Shut up. He's not tricking anyone. Free pizza. Look at that house. That's the guy. That's the guy. That guy did all that stuff to a woman? Yeah. That's what the guy said. Didn't look the type. Why would he lie? Let's kidnap this little prick. Let's do it. Is this done? Excellent. Excellent. Good. Come on, man. Just let me do-- - Wha, wha, wha... - Careful with the goods. You really want to do this? Yes, man. I won't be giving it away. That's for sure. Come on. Do you think you're ready? Yes. - You sure? - I'm sure. Give me the bag. All right. You asked for it. - Uh-- - Hello. Uh, one medium meat lover's pizza. Yes. Thank you. That was very fast delivery. Yeah. Oh, my friend. I have money for you. Good. You know, this reminds me of movie I saw last week. - Oh yeah? - Oh. Please be gentleman and pick that up for me? Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Very funny. Very funny. Oh my God, dude. That was so awesome. Yeah. Almost as funny as it's going to be when Bianca finds out you chickened out on Magda again. All right. I'll see you in a bit. - What? Why? - Pizza joint is just up there. I'll see you in a few minutes. What are you-- Are you serious? - Where are you going? - You're the best. Thank you. Love you too, Ike. I'm telling Merrick. - Wait for my word. - Okay. Hey, sicko. What? Time to pay the piper. I don't think I know you. Oh, he's-- he's just kidding. Relax, relax! - We just want to talk to you. - About what? About keeping your hands to yourself! What are you doing? Kidnap him! Oh, you little-- Ike, what are you doing leaving Rudy out in the road like that? Oh, fuck it. I can't do it. So you just dropped Rudy off, huh? What? Yes. No. What? I told you to train him. He's trained. He's fine. He knows what to do. I heard-- I heard what you did with Rudy and the exhibitionist. Oh... You can come to my party, okay? - High five. - Whoa... You're not a gay, are you? No. I'm not a gay, Merrick. I love breasts. - High five. - High five. ♪ Before everyone dies... ♪ ♪ We can compromise... ♪ - Oh! - I smelled it coming! I love you! Muah! Drink, drink. Drink, drink, drink, drink! Whoa, that's a warm drink! Hey, hands are on the table. No hands on the table. You know that. That's bullshit. Bad word. No beer. You never said that was a rule. Okay. It's a rule. You happy now? Get your hands off the table, drink, drink, drink. Wow. Drink like the dog you are! Drink, drink. Hey, he said he-- off the table. - Oh, puke, puke, puke. - That's a beautiful... Come on, Rudy boy. Come on. You need another drink, buddy. Hold on a second. Ah-ha! You're funny this time! Hey, it's the guy. Merrick's completely insane, man. I would have been safer with those thugs. Yeah, man. Wait. What thugs? What do you think of Magda? You should ask her out, man. No. - You should just do it. - It's not that easy. It's exactly that easy. What's the worst that can happen? - She says no. - So. - So? - Like, who cares, man? How many "No's" do you think I've gotten from chicks, Ike? Thousands. Go fuck yourself. Hey, hey. Do you think she's out of my league? For sure she's out of your league. But, but, but man, hotter chicks have been with worse guys. Right? - I'll take that. - You'll do okay. Oh, hello. I didn't realize you were already here. Huh? - I'm Candy. - Oh, it's nice to-- Your friend told me you were a little shy. My friend, huh? Okay. Ah! Okay. That's nice. Okay. What's it getting back for? Frankie said if I primed you up properly, soon you'd be taking it like a champ. A strange way to put it. What you doing? You must be pretty kinky deep down, huh? I don't know. I haven't checked. That's the door. Ah. Huh... Don't tell me. Let me guess. You're here to see Frankie. That makes more sense. Sorry I'm late. Ooh, me likey. Ah! So much for being shy, huh? Sorry you got caught up in that. So awkward. Candy comes on a little strong. Traumatizing even. I need my car today, Ike. I'd invite you up for a taste, but it might be weird. I'll just take the ride, thanks. Okay. Where's your car at? My boss' house. Can you drop me off at Magda's? I should redeem myself. Oh no. What'd you do? I was a stammering idiot. Frankie, man. What's your secret? You really want to know? Yes. I pretend it's you. What? When I'm talking to a girl I want to sleep with, I imagine I'm talking to you. - That's gay. - No. The trick is to convince yourself you're talking to someone nonthreatening, someone you kind of got power over. Yeah, but you don't have power over me. Okay, Ike. - Put your seat belt on. - Oh, yeah. Safety first. - Hey, can I just-- - No. Yeah. - Hi. - Hello. Just in the neighborhood? No, I came from the other side of town actually. Oh? Is something wrong? Yeah. There sure is. What's wrong? Uh, I sometimes I-- Yeah. I meant to ask you something yesterday, and I I couldn't get it out. - Why not? - Because I- I get tongue-tied when I'm around you. - Around little old me? - Yeah. Well, that's just silly. Magda will you go out with me today? - I don't think I can. I- - Then say no. Don't- I... I don't even know your name. Sorry, it's Ike. - Ike Starkey. - Ike. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ike. Ah, pleasure's all mine. OK. Uhh... pick me up in an hour? Ah... Oh. Yeah, sorry. - All right. - Yeah. So I'll pick you up in an hour. - OK. - Back here. - Back here. - Don't go anywhere. - I won't. - Bye. ♪ ...would you Change the world ♪ ♪ Would you make it any better ♪ ♪ Would you take away All the hurt? ♪ ♪ Would you take the time to See through someone's eyes ♪ ♪ Would you take the time To change someone's life ♪ ♪ No more heartache ♪ Hoo.

Didn't have time to go to the gym to... you know. I'll go get my... shoes. Great. I'll just put on some clothes. Ready? Ladies first? Thanks. So. Is, is there a particular plan? Oh yeah, I, umm... I got something in mind. Umm... If you say so. So what does Ike do when he's not delivering pizza? Uhh, I draw. - Yeah? - Yeah. What do you draw? Uhh, everything. Uhh the human form, mostly. I... Uhh, I like to draw graphic novels. Yeah? - What kind? - Uhh, superheroes. Mmm. Who's your favorite superhero? Uhh, Sketcher. Sketcher is my favorite superhero. I, I invented him myself. Crazy. Well, what does he do? Uhh, he, he can draw anything, and he has a super-powered pencil that uhh, makes his drawings come to life. - Sounds fascinating? - Right. Like like, if he, if he was in trouble he could just draw a bunch of lions or something, and they would come to protect him. Or just draw a flying car. "See you later, danger. Not this time." You don't read comics, do you? You're really freaking me out right now. Seriously where are you taking me? Stop being so impatient. - Impatient? - Impatient. Uhh, so... Uhh, you were gonna tell me about Magda's world. Well, what do you wanna know? Anything. Anything at all. Umm... I knit. Sorry? I knit. Like, umm... needles and balls of yarn and stuff. Isn't that sort of an old-lady hobby? I guess, I mean... I learned it from my grandma, so- Oh yeah? And how'd that happen? You were watching one day, and thought to yourself "Hey, now that looks like a fun time." No. I just really liked watching her knit while she was alive. Oh my god! Ah, oh my god. Oh, look. My shoelace is untied. That guy needs a face punch. You can make fun of me with something else if you want. That's absolutely not necessary. So what does, uhh... Sketcher look like, anyway? Uhh, you don't wanna hear about that. He's like six feet tall. He's wiry, and, uhh... has a black hoodie, and usually keeps in the shadows. Hmm. Why? Because it's a big responsibility to have your drawings come to life. And, so do you like draw him yourself, and-? Yeah. Cool. Well, can I like, see him sometime, or- ? Of course. - Yeah. - Cool. Unless you're making fun of me. Me? No. So what would, uhh Sketcher draw, if, umm if there's like, a crazy big guy who just like came in here right now and wanted to kick his ass? Umm, well... Jesus! Jesus Christ? Umm... Uhh, why don't you order something? I'm, I'm just gonna go to the washroom. Oh. OK. Don't rush off. Hello. Are you ready to order something? Hi. Umm... Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. How's the, uhh uhh, half a chicken? It's really good, it's my favorite. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'd recommend it. Leave a 20. Let's go. You guys are taking this a little far, don't you think? Shut up. What are you gonna do? Kill me? Nobody said anything about that. Just let me go! Didn't I tell you to shut up? Excuse me, sir. Do you have the time? Why don't you get out of here, old man? - Move your feet. - No. Please. Stop! No, no, no, dude! You can't do this. You can't do this, please! You should have thought of that before. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry! Can I talk to you for a second? What? What is it? I don't think we should beat him like this. How would you like me to beat him, huh? I thought we were supposed to bring him back in one piece. I'm gonna bring him back in one piece but I'm gonna kick his ass a little first. Young fella? I don't know what you're up to but you better skedaddle before you put yourself in harm's way. Comprende? - Thank you. - Amigo. M-Magda, where are you going? - Away from you. - Please don't go. Why do you care? You can't even stick around for five minutes? - I can explain. - Well, I don't wanna hear it. N-no. Please. My god. What happened? I was jumped. Uh. Why? Don't know. I... I don't know what's going on. Will you be honest with me? Of course. Are you... dealing drugs? If I promise to tell you, will you come with me? Magda, please. So you grabbed a boob? Not "grab." Like, I, palmed it, maybe. She pressed it into me. Do you think that's why these guys are chasing you? I don't know. Why else? Does this happen a lot, like the whole boob-grabbing thing? Ow! I didn't grab- Yeah. Yeah, all the time. It's how I get tipped, actually. Jerk. Knew I shouldn't have trusted you. You can trust me. Why'd you think I was dealing drugs? I don't know. - You're kinda sketchy. - I'm sketchy? - Uhuh. - You're the one that knits, OK? Gotta be careful with that. So are you... glad you came up here? Uhuh. Yeah. It's nice. Mmm. Yummy. Thank you for that. Come on, it's getting chilly, and we have a long walk ahead. That was kinda mean. I mean, it was just so- you got some- here, I'll get it. You have to be patient. It has to fit just right. You can't force the heart. OK. I say we turn it. No, he couldn't have gotten far on foot. We've been all over this area, Perry. He got away when that son of a bitch hit us. Son of a bitch. He got lucky tonight. Get him tomorrow. He's probably right under our noses. - Yeah. - Let's get out of here. And, and it's nutritious. What? It's them! Magda, run! - Take her! - Ike! - Pick up the gun! - No! Freeze! Don't you move. - Shoot him! - No! - Shoot him in the leg! - Please don't shoot him! Let her go, OK? - Just get him! - Run, Ike! I'm not leaving you, OK? Oh, shit! Hey, which way'd he go? Come on, we gotta get this tonight. Did you hear me? Which way? What did you do with the girl, Perry! What? I, I put her in the trunk. That's not right. You can't do that. Well, I'm not gonna hurt her. She's just- She's just leverage. These were good pants. Hey, you lied to me. He didn't do it! Hey, that's what the guy said. He didn't hurt anyone, did he? - He might- might have-- - Perry! He might have. I don't know. I didn't ask the guy. You said... you were gonna ask him. Don't ask that stuff, but he did something. A guy doesn't get kidnapped for nothing. It's not in his face. - He is not violent! - Who cares? Today, we almost got him! We've got his girl. We've got him for sure now. This job is bad, Perry. OK? And I don't wanna do any of this! This... This ain't for me. You kidding? You're great at this stuff! You're a natural. Way better than I was when I started. I quit! Can't quit on me. Perry! I quit. Fuck! Forgive me. Why? How's that even possible? I guess she's double-jointing like she used to on-- What the hell are you doing here? - I need you guys' help. - Hang on. You double-joining? - Wish I was. - Really? Why? Uhh... I don't know. Did you guys hear me? I said I need help! Hey, hey! You're major cock-blocking here. Get the hell outta here, you're ruining my mojo. I don't give a shit about your mojo, you selfish homophobe! Someone took Magda, I need help. Rudy! - I... - Ru- - I'm sorry. I got a delivery. - Get this lit for me. Hey. You. I don't know who told you that I'm a homophobe but I've never slept with a man. The other one was in college. It's a three-some and the girl was just late. And I, it was just a little possible. - Bianca! - What's up, Ike? - Someone took Magda. - I heard you. Do you want some advice? Find another girl. Wicked Wedge, glad you called. - How can I help you? - Really? Uhuh. Uhuh. Mm-hmm. Yeah? Sure. Do you want cheese with that? Sure. I'll take this one. You take the next two. She was just late! Jesus. Rudy. I'm sorry, Ike. I gotta go, man. - Are you serious? - I gotta take these deliveries. I'll see if I'm done on time, I'll see what I can do. I'm sorry, Ike, I gotta go. Are you being serious right now? - I'll see you later. - Rudy! Guys! - Ike! - What's up, Ike? My friend was kidnapped tonight. Can you help me out? I think you should go to the authorities, man. I know it sucks to involve the popo, but gotta take the proper channel, dude. No. No, he'll hurt her. He's crazy. Are you in Make-Believe Land again? No! When have I ever been in Make-Believe Land? Every time when your friends gets kidnapped. I've never had a friend get kidnapped! This is the first friend that has gotten kidnapped! God! Ah! ...no. OK. Let me call you back. Perfect. Thanks. Hey, Ike. Buddy! Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. Hey. Hey, are... are you sure you're OK to drive? Oh, I'm fine. I'm good. Dude. What's going on? Do you need a hand? Do you wanna tell Phing what's going on? Do you know... how hard it is to find a decent - side-kick in this business? - What's your name? He was smart strong - intimidating... - What do you want? I just want this whole thing to be over. I want your boyfriend to show up. He's not my boyfriend. He's not coming for me. You better hope he is. Dude. - That's some crazy shit, man! - I know. Phing, I gotta get her back. What's your plan? Gonna... I'm gonna drive up there kick down the door, and get her back. You want my help for this? OK. Why not? This is a community concern, right? - Damn right! - Let's do this. Let's do this! - Yes! - Whoo! - Whoo! - Ha! - Yeah! - Ha! Yeah. Whoo! You don't know where she is, do you? Not at all. - Yeah. - Some guy called for you. - Who was it? - He left you a message. Wants you to meet him here. Tonight. Thanks. Yeah? Would you like to borrow my car, Ike? Y-yes, please? He sounded crazy, so be careful. And don't you scratch my ride. - My name is Magdalena. - I don't- I don't wanna know your name. Magda for short. Why Ike? They're gonna rip his heart out. What is that supposed to mean? What's your name? Ask me my name again. Hey, go ahead. Ask me! - So we're really gonna do this? - Yes. OK. What's the plan again? The plan? You wanna know the plan? First, we find a way into that warehouse. Then we sneak up on him from both sides. "Oh, it's you, Pizza Boy!" "Why don't you come over here and kick my ass?" "Step away from the girl." Then I'll distract him, see? And you smash him over the head with something. Then I free Magda and she French-kisses me. Why do I have to smash him over the head? That's the safe part. I'm gonna be right in his line of fire. - He's got a gun. - Oh. Did you bring something to smash him over the head with? Like a hammer, or bat? We'll find something inside. Come on. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Please just let me go. This... It was supposed to be an easy job. Get the pizza guy, drive him to the Point, get paid. - I won't tell the police. - But no. No, he's gotta be a runner. He just keeps running, and running! I swear to god- Where's your pussy pizza boy? Right behind you! I can't believe he actually showed up! Step away from the girl! So nice of you to make it. - Ike! - I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have gotten you involved. You OK? Phing, what the hell? He's the bad guy, right? Yeah, but, a little over-kill, don't you think? Wrong! I'm the bad guy, turd stain! Me! I'm the bad guy! This- this thug couldn't even kidnap a puppy. Huh? All you had to do was grab him. I even told you where he works. Fuck. What's wrong with China, Ike? Phing, what the hell is going on? Hold that thought. Perfect. Wh-what are you, what are you doing, Phing? Hop on, Ike. Let's get you comfortable. No games. Don't. - I will shoot her. - OK, OK. Tie up that hand. OK, OK. Good. Magda... You comfy, Ike? Huh? Well, well, well... What do we have here? Jack's back! I was kinda hoping to bump into you. Yeah. You are next. Come here. I think you have a little something that belongs to me. Oh god, that felt good. Yeah. OK. I told you it wasn't over. All right, then. I'm a little drunk. Why are you doing this? You should have gotten on that plane to China, Ike! Do you know what AB negative heart goes for, these days? You're an organ harvester? If I invest in futures and commodities I might not have to work for years and that's awesome! How long have you been doing this? Jack. You got this under control? Yeah. I'm on it. Shh. You're supposed to be good guys. Who says we're not? Get out of this! Come on, get yourself out of this! Ah! Please, come on, just this once! You really hurt my feelings. You don't know a thing about me. - So full of shit. - No, I'm not. I was nice to you when I took your blood. Oh yeah, you're a real saint. I offered you a cookie on the way out. Hope you choke on a cookie, you psychopath! Shut up! You don't know a thing about me. I'm not a psychopath. OK? I save lives! And this is gonna hurt a little bit. Rudy! Great, get me out of here, man. What do you think I'm doing? Rudy! No! No! This isn't funny, guys. I don't got time for this shit. You're gonna pay for this, you son of a bitch! - How much? - Shut up! You know you can't shoot him if you plan to take his heart. I said, shut up! I don't need your heart! How much are you getting for it? What if I can give you more? Keep talking? But you have to let us all go. And I suppose you'll go home and keep your mouth shut? Yes. And I can keep doing my thing? Yes. Is that true, Ike? If I let you go I can keep doing my thing? No, I'm gonna stab you! See? Ike's truthful. - That's why I like him. - Get off me! What'd they do to you, Jack? I'm gonna kill you so badly! Stupid bitch! Ahh! Fuck! Ike! Don't get excited before we take your heart out! Magda! I'm so sorry! Just cut me loose.
