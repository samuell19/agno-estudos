You good? I felt that one. Why didn't you wake me up? I tried. Not hard enough. And here I was thinking you'd say thank you. For what? I've been pinching myself the last 10 minutes. Oh, Jesus. - What? - Spence. That shit's not real. Worked, didn't it? Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Look, I wasn't going to pinch your face. Anyway, you're like wearing four layers. Wanna take your clothes off? - Ewe. - Exactly. So what was it this time? Sarah? Silent treatment, really? We're four? I don't remember. Of course you don't. I remember how it felt. Vintage. Oh yeah, we got turned around at that murdery down in Brattleboro, but we're close, I think. Shit, did we not have... The last 20 miles. What, do you think I'm using a map by choice? Come on. You know what you need? - Chocolate. - Chocolate. I also need beer. Of course you do. Of course you do. I hope my balls won't shrivel up in this cold. Don't tell me about your balls. Hello? Yep. My dick shrunk like six inches. Gross. There was no one in there. It's free, baby. Let's go. It's bigger than I thought it would be. - That's what... - Don't. That's what I was gonna say too. Perv. 357 miles outside of Philadelphia, 29 degrees Fahrenheit and one car in the lot. Ours. Seriously? Don't be jealous. I got you one too. It's always good to have individual recordings. Yeah, your confidence in pilgrimage is... Contagious? Admirable. Thank you. Look, it's not that I think that... It's fine, every duo need a skeptic. It's all right. That's not what I mean. I'm glad you're here. Obviously. Look Spence, I think we'll find something, I do. It's just don't want you to be disappointed if it's not... It's not what? Let's get inside. I'm the cold's getting worse. And there is no bell. Ding, ding, bitch. Do we have a reservation or? No, their website started like 2003. And they're obviously not on Expedia, either. How do we know this place is still running? I called ahead. They old guy on the other end said that they were walk-in only. Afternoon, folks. Well, you look exactly like I thought you would. Searching for a place to rest your head? Wow, you're really horny for this vibe. He's quite the comedian, isn't he? Please excuse my brother, yes. Two rooms, one night. Ah, ah, unfortunately we've only got the one, but I'm happy to say it's a suite and I'll certainly give you the upgrade free of charge. So does that mean? Like breakfast in bed? We offer all the amenities. Here you, up, almost forgot. Before the transaction is complete, oh, watch that there, will you both be so kind as to sign the guestbook. Eagle Inn tradition. Cool. Got a pen? Oh, yes. It's a bit formal, but do the trick. Hold on a minute, if I can find it. There we are. It's a fountain pen. I don't super care. Good to feel connected to those who came before you. Totally. Don't you think? Spencer. How do you? I heard you two talking outside. Scared you though, didn't I? Excellent. Will you two care for a stroll around the property before it gets dark? Sure. We didn't pay you. Okay. Hope you're warm enough. I don't think I brought enough warm stuff for this. Back when we opened in 87, this was quite the hideaway. When did the shift happen? Ah. You mean when did people stop coming? It was back in 94. New interstate all but destroyed on walk in market. How have you managed to stay afloat? Struck a deal with the developer. Quite, quite fortuitous actually. Teal estate's crazy, huh? Must've been beautiful back then. It still is in its own way. Awesome. Speaking of beautiful, snack attack. How's it going today, Dean? Shut up. No, no, no. I think I get the appeal. Jack of all trades, that boy. We like to keep up appearances around here. Well, he is doing just fine with that. Sometimes feels like he's the one running the place. - Oh yeah. - Jesus. Much warmer inside. Spence, do you have the keys? I left something in the car. More luggage? Just something personal. I've got pillows and blankets and towels... She said it personal. You better hurry, dark soon. - I'll see you in there. - Okay. So you said you're all booked up tonight? Uh huh. So where is everyone? Early to bed, early to rise. God it's like Norman Rockwell fucked the crypt keeper. It sounds like you're type. The oldest I ever dated was forty-five and that's only because he has really good skin. Your accommodations for the evening. Thanks. Place is really cute. You didn't mention anything about there only be one bed. Is there any way that we can have... There's absolutely no one else staying in this hotel. No way in hell. I mean there's literally no one else in the parking lot. So where do you think he's keeping the bodies? I don't think it's that. I think he just has like a weird fetish for nostalgia or something. Makes sense. Listen, if you end up feeling weird and want to go or something. I'll let you know. Great. The documents in order? Yeah, they're over here. Great. Let's do this. So. The medical report said that dad was gone by the time the ambulance showed up. Mom had been dead two hours and blood was cold. Shit, I should be recording this. You know a phone can do that these days, right? Thank you so much for the feedback. Ignoring it. December 20th, 1994, Joseph and Mary Elizabeth Moss enjoy a quiet retreat near the Canadian border. A final romantic getaway before the birth was their firstborn child. Spoiler alert. It's twins. Gross. On their long journey home, an unexpected blizzard... Nor'easter. Who's telling the story? Facts are facts, sis. Okay, and how many liberties have you taken? I'm dramatizing. But if the information's out there. Okay, an unexpected nor'easter and a wrong turn send them on a winding path down the mountain where they happen upon the Eagle Inn. Seeking refuge from the wind and snow, they check in. Pausing. No, no, no. Keep it going. Hello? Mr. Moss, pardon the interruption, but I neglected to mention that we're serving cocktails and other assorted libations in the library, a happy hour of sorts. Cool. We do hope you and your lovely sister... - What is it? - Will join us. More booze. Once again, all amenities are included. Will you be there? Yes? Ah, yeah, sure. Sounds good, can't wait. Excellent. It's done. So weird. Continue. That night, a month before she's due, Mary Elizabeth suddenly goes into labor at the stroke of midnight. Duh duh duh. Ooh. And after shock from the storm perhaps, or something far more sinister. See, that's traumatizing. After an excruciating night, the twins are born safely, but Mary Elizabeth is not so lucky. Taken by sepsis at dawn. The night manager phones the local authorities, but it's days before they can reach them. Or, what's left of them. God, how could you be so morbid about this? Tragedy plus time. When the authorities finally arrive, Joseph was nowhere to be found. Impossible, but true. We're here tonight to see if we can find anything that speaks to this disappearance, and perhaps, find some form of closure for the tragedy that has haunted the Moss family for decades. And scene. There's a remote under the pillow. Of course. - Drinks? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You first. Yeah, right. Oh, come on. What are the odds that if we both take a drink... Oh, nothing's stopping you. Go right ahead. Drink up, buddy, it's your funeral. Listen, I don't think... He didn't roofie it or anything if that's what you're worried about. Oh yeah. No. Sorry. I wasn't trying to insinuate that. Yeah, you were. Look, I get it. Weird fucking dude. But, the stuff's all top shelf. Well aged. By product of nobody staying here anymore. So we are the only ones here. Obviously. Why say that there's only one room then? Maintenance. Right, he, he said that. Sorry. What did you say your name was? Dean. - Spencer. - Sarah. You, you were born second. Well? - Actually... - We don't know. Really? Isn't that like a sense of pride with you guys or something? How did you know that we were? Well, you're obviously not a couple. Drink anybody? So Dean, how long have you been working here? I'm in and out. It depends on the season. Do people still go missing? Sure. Weird things happen here, but it's nothing like what you've heard. Wanna talk about it? Wow. You're giving me mad Anderson Cooper vibes right now. Thank you. You guys aren't reporters, are you? No, this is, it's more of a personal project. Eh, why not. - Come on. - Great. 91. 92. 93. 94. 95. Keith and Kayla. They were a good couple. Why do I have to do this. 96. 97. 98. I'm so close. I'm so. I don't what to freak you guys out. This place is safe. They're just stories. I'm not worried about it. 1994. Shit. Sorry. Sorry. Ah. Still figuring this thing out. Canadian border. The final romantic. Okay. Ready. Yeah. You're the kids. I didn't know we had a reputation, let alone one that preceded us. What do you know? Well, not as much as you, if that's the reason why you're here. microfilm newspaper clippings, and that medical report we bribed the guy at the county coroner's office for on the way up here. So. Your voice will be a welcome addition to the conversation. Hmm. What do you want to know? Something you can't just read about it online. My brother's looking for ghost stuff. I don't believe in ghosts. Okay, not just ghost stuff. Okay, what then? You don't believe in ghosts? Souls, energy, sure. That's different. Enlighten me later. I'm just saying that... I know what you're saying and I'm here to help you find it. Well, it's not just about me, Sarah. It's about us. - Both of us together. - I know it's about both of us. Being here... Obviously, it's why I'm here. Do you guys want to take a tour? Thanks, Norman Bates already showed us around. No, I mean the real tour. I got a couple more chores I got to finish up before I'm off. You can tag along if you'd like. I, I have to take care of something back at the room. You go ahead. I'll meet up with you later. Are you sure? Yeah. Hey, not to be high maintenance, but Jack Torrance did say assorted libations, not a single bottle of apple Brandy. So, think we can make a pit stop? That can be arranged. Good. I'm thirsty. Who's going to be a debutante? Who's going to be the prettiest, you are. Yes, you're the one. You're. You will. Yeah. You will be the one. Yes. You'll see. You're gonna be the most desirable debutante. And desirable. And just. You'll wait, and you'll be great. You'll be perfect. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Used the be reservation only. Saturday nights, you couldn't find a seat in here if you tried. No shit. Yeah. That was before my time though. So what are you in the market for? Vodka cran, splash of lime. Preferably in a chilled glass, but I'm flexible. Or just vodka. Vodka's fine. Actually, you're in luck. You sneaky devil. So your parents, they stayed here 20 years ago? 24. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Not to be a downer, but not so sure you're going to find something of theirs in the lost and found, if that's the missing piece of the puzzle you're looking for. Not exactly. We grew up in the foster care system. So nobody knew or talked about anything really. This is, I don't know, sometimes just occupying a space is enough to put you in the right frame of mind. To what? See things differently. Hmm. Let me know. Stronger? It's stronger. Oh no, no, no, no. It's good. Nah, that's all right. I already am. So you live here? Mostly. Kind of part of the deal. Must get pretty lonely. Eh, as soon as things quiet down a bit, something else pops up like clockwork. Oof, she's a squirter. Try that one out for size. Better? Much. Hmm. I'm going to go get out of this monkey suit. I'll be back. Do you want me to? You just take a seat, relax. You're on vacation. First one was better. Nothing too suspicious yet, but something in the atmosphere definitely seems off, some kind of nondescript gloom hanging over the place. It's. Oh, shit. Oh. He did make it stronger, wow. God. Okay. My name is Sarah Moss. My brother is Spencer Moss. We're at the Eagle Inn. We drove here from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. None of this is real. This isn't real. This can't be real. Dean? I'll be there in a minute. Man enters. He puts on what seems to be peanut butter. Child's voice somewhere in the distance. Spreads the peanut butter across the bread. I don't know what he's doing here, I don't. Pulls a paper out of his pocket and takes, takes out a pill. I'm so sorry. Don't know what this powder is that he's. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm coming. I'll be right there. He leaves. I'll be there in a minute. This is room number three. It's not real. It's not real. None of this is real. Wake up. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm coming. I'll be right there. Down here. Dean? You can do this. You can do this. Do it. Do it. What the fuck! Dammit! - Spencer! - Sarah! Sarah! - Spencer! - Sarah! Oh my god. Oh my god, are you okay? I'm so sorry I brought you here. Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here. Dean ditched me. And I saw the guy at the front desk and he was cutting his wrist with a box cutter! Shh, shh, shh. Listen. Listen. What? Sarah, what is it? No, no, no. Listen. Listen, listen. They are other people in this hotel? Sort of. They're, they're, it's like they're in the, they're in the TVs. And they're in the TVs. Fuck, the TVs. Sarah, Sarah, we gotta get out of here. Come on. - okay. We gotta. Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here. Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here. It's like they were, they were trapped or something. There wasn't anything they could do. I may not be the skeptic here, but I did not plan for this shit. Shit, keys? - Oh. - Shit, shit. Over here. - Over here. - Shit, shit, shit. Wait. Just hold my hand. It'll be over and it'll be fine. I don't think I can do it. Stop, stop. They're getting faster. Oh my god. Joseph. You shouldn't have come. Dude. How the hell did you get in here? You can't leave. No one can. What do you mean we can't leave? The hotel, it does something to people. Does what? You're going to need these. Come on, Spence, let's go. You're not going to make it very far before you find yourself right back here. Believe me. I've tried. Thanks. We'll take our chances. Mother... Fucker. - What are we gonna do? - I don't know. Cell phones don't work. Just landline. No, it doesn't dial out plus we got Manny Wilkes playing operator on the other end. Oh, dammit. What if we just ran? Ran where? I don't really, down the road somewhere. I don't know, there's gotta be a place, right. It's freezing outside. Yeah, so run fast. Well, where are we even going to go? We're in the middle of nowhere. What about the gas station? That's like 20 miles from here. Again, running. Okay, fine. Sure, whatever. Let's go. Wait, Sarah. Sarah. We're just gonna leave all our shit in the car? - Yep. Okay. Shit. - Shit. Shit. - No, no, no, no. Shit. God dammit. What the hell? Fuck. Twilight Zone beat you too it, asshole. What? The inescapable loop back to hell. Season five, episode 30. They did it better. Yeah. Sorry about that. Dean, what the hell is this place? If - I told you something supernatural, would you... Believe you? - Yeah. - Obviously. I don't know if you remember a 30 minutes ago. All right, all right, all right. Glad we're on the same page. Why didn't you tell us any of this? It's against the rules. Oh, great. Well, none of you're breaking them, if you could please continue so at least I know how I'm going to die before it actually happens. Easy. The Inn attracts the wayward, those who have lost their way or searching for something. Great, great. We love a spiritual death trap. - Whose side are you on? - Don't answer that. Hello? And he fucking answered it. Good evening, Mr. Moss, just checking in to see if there's anything I can do for ya. Bubble bath, midnight snack, bedtime story. As I said, we have all the amenities. You see the amount of books we have here. I hit all the inflections, whatever you want me to read, I'll read for you. That sounds great, yes, that too, uh huh. I'm quite the reader, Mr. Moss. Don't underestimate me. You like drama, comedy, fiction, non-fiction? I can do it all. And feel like a dip in the pool for your last night, for ah, yeah. I think you'll enjoy it. I have hiking cream by the way, gets in between the toes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That all sounds. - And how about the misses? How's she doing? Is there anything I can do for her? No. She's she's asleep, oh, I'm sorry, you're right, you're right. It is your sister. Oh, you know what? That actually sounds, that sounds really awesome right now, but we have kind of a, a killer schedule this evening, kind of wall to wall. You know, we're really booked up. So if anything comes up, we'll be sure to let you know, your generosity is very much appreciated. Thank you. What does he want? - He wanted to know if we needed anything. - What? He's toying with us, like I'm fricking demented, Pepperidge farm spokesperson. What are we gonna do? Hey kids. Dad? I want you to know how hard it's been not being able to watch you grow up. Every day, every single day. Spence, I hope you've grown up to be a better man than me. No, you know what? I, I know you have. And Sarah bear, I, I can't forgive you for killing her, your mother, my wife. Making me do what I did. It should've been you. And you know it. Don't you? Spencer, yeah, he came out easy, but you, you just had to fight. Had to suck her dry like the parasite you are. Wanna know a secret? I will make sure you end up just like her. Run little bitch. Hi kids. Dean, what is this? I want you to know how hard it's been. This place, them, it changes people. Every day. Every single. Pushes them to their most vulnerable. Spence. Perform the ultimate sin. I hope you've grown up to be a better man than me. - He's in his own personal hell. - And Sar-bear, I. They all are. Turn it off. I can't forgive you for killing her. Turn it off! It's already unplugged, Sarah. What I've done. Sarah. Come with me. I have a place. It was autumn of '96, just before your parents got here. The inn, it was going under big time. The owner, and this was his whole life, his entire existence. One night, when all felt lost, he tied a weight to his ankles, was about to jump into the pool when the bell at the reception desk rang, somebody needed a room. Turns out he was a property developer and the two of them got to chatting and struck up a deal. Reverse mortgage, if you will, a line of credit to keep the inn afloat. Now for the owner, he's thinking like what a godsend, a miracle. But there was a catch. What? Tell us. He'd have to fill the hotel. Harvest 100 souls, one in each room. I'm sorry, harvest? What the hell does that mean? Your room's last on the list. The final vacancy. Dude, who the hell are you? Why are you here? It's complicated. So you are a ghost. I knew it. No. Prove it. Warm. Tactile. Thank you. So then why are you helping him? I signed a contract too, kind of like the one you two signed. - We didn't. - Wait. Sarah, we signed the guest book. Does that mean that we're? Listen, the ink may be dry, but the night's not over yet. Destroy the book, maybe you have a chance. Maybe? Well nobody's ever done it before. You seem to know an awful lot about this. How many people have you helped him kill? Look, I'm trying to help you here. Do you have any idea what he would do to me if he knew I was talking right now? That's probably not as bad as what he's going to do to us come what, sunrise. It's more like what you're going to do to yourself. Burn the book. Hello? Mr. Moss, I thought you'd be asleep by now. What can I do for ya? Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, we have extra towels. How many you need? My, my, we're feeling luxurious tonight, aren't we, Mr. Moss? Not a problem. I'll bring them right over. In a jiff. Mr. Moss? Mr. Moss! Shit. No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. What's wrong? She's in trouble. Poor kids. I'll be right there. My my. Gracious me. Ms. Moss, what you doing in the office? What are you doing with that? Answer me. Now! I. That isn't yours. Now why would you take something that doesn't belong to you? I asked you a question. I asked you a question. You must understand the enormous value that book holds for me. So do you want it back? I would. Good girl. Good girl. Run! I'm gonna get you. Get back here! I need it back! What the fuck? Come on, come on, let's go, come on. Run! Let's go, come on. You're gonna let him catch you. High step, high step, run. Go, go. Come on, please. We can do this. Hurry! Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Move, move. Ah, shit! - Did you get it? - Spencer, what happened back there? I don't know. It was like I was there with you. - I could feel what you were feeling. - Just do it. Come on. Let me in. Let me in! - Wait, how do we know this is even gonna work? - Of course it'll fucking work. How do you know? You've never done this before. - What if it, what if it like kills us or something? - Kills us? - I don't know, I'm not an expert in this scenario. - You're gonna be sorry! Okay, he's clearly got a hard-on for this thing, right. What if we bargain with him? Right? Give him the book back, have him take our names out. That might work, right? Don't be stupid. He'll do anything to get it back. Just put the book in the fire! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. No, I won't. I'll be your friend if you give me the book. Spence. Wait, Spence. - We don't have time. - What about dad? Sarah, Sarah, listen to me. Sarah, that wasn't him, okay. It wasn't him. We have to do this. I'm gonna huff. I'm gonna puff. And I'm gonna blow the door down. Sarah, we've gotta. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Okay, Sarah. It's gonna work, okay. Two, three. No! Why? My baby, why? What's so funny? God, you're pathetic. I mean really pathetic. Please. Please. I did what you asked. Almost. Almost? Almost? Not almost, all of it. All of it! I did it all, everything you asked for, I did it. Dean, what's he talking about? Arrangements like these, they just have very clear deliverables. Oh no, no, no. No! Yes, yes. Don't pull that crap with me. - No. - Yes. Yes, they do and you knew that when you signed. - Sarah, we gotta get out of here. - Sit. Thank you. Where were we? Let me go. - Yeah. - Let me go. Yeah. Sorry, that part of the contract is now null and void. You promised me a ledger, baby. Oh, no, no, no. You promised a ledger. - Those were not the rules, no. - Oh, great. You know that. Now listen, those were not the rules, no. Oh, great. You know that, now listen, let me rebuild it. Let me rebuild it, this is what I can do. I have a great memory and you know that. I remember all the names. Listen to me. I know all the names and you know it. Come on, give 'em to me. Megan Franklin. Anita Sanchez. William Sawyer. Bradford Lawson. I remember them all. Let me rebuild it. It can't be in your hand, remember? That is crap. That's nonsense. That's not the rules. Oh? No. No. No, no, no. You, you, you are making up new rules right now. No, fuck the book. Screw the book. You have to have the souls. The could. Are you, you're fucking me over. You have to think about the administrative burden. Oh what crap is that? You gotta think about the administrative burden. That's crap. What shit is that? I'm sorry. I am so, so, sorry. He really is. The past couple of decades have been particularly rough. But what a trooper he's been, huh? I really did want you to have a memorable stay, all the amenities for your final night. Why did you do this? What do you want? Everything. Now listen to me, mister. You said, you said if I got you 100 souls, I could have mine back. Easy now. Give me my soul. Release! You know what, you've always been more trouble. Oh. Than you're worth. Shit, that feels good. Down, down, down he goes. Fuck, it's hot in here. God damn. Hi. You're? Why couldn't you just do it yourself? There's a clause he requested. He didn't trust me. Can't imagine why, but I'm a man that always abides by the terms of a contract. So here's the deal. No. No deal. But you haven't even heard my proposition. I don't need to. There's no escaping this. You signed the book. You said we had until sunrise. It's a little more complicated than that. Man, I'm just getting a little thirsty, huh? Drink anybody? No, right. Just me. Cool. Oh So you can't leave the hotel. You already figured that out, right? Wander the property a little bit, explore the grounds. There's a stream up that hill in autumn, it's fucking beautiful. But you can't escape the darkness. The shadows will follow you. What you saw in the pool and your television is nothing compared to what will come in the coming hours, only they won't feel like hours. They'll feel like years. You said you needed a hundred souls. Leave her and take mine. Spence, no. My main man, Spence. That's what I'm talking about. I admire the nobility, but the unique circumstances of your birth have provided me with a kind of, how do you say buy one, get one. Please? However, it seems as though we're up for new management here at the Eagle Inn, someone to replace this fucking guy, you know. It's easy stuff. Check people in and trap their souls, no biggie. You think that's something you two could handle? How can we trust you? We saw what you did to him. Okay, I like you guys. I really do. Strong cheekbones. Strong-will. Nothing like your father. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Your mine now, remember that. What if we say no? Then I'll see you in hell. Why are you doing this? Why? Why? well, I've got a growing empire here. I need more aggregators, you know. You think this haunted hotel's the only one I have in my portfolio? I have holdings in every state, every country, all over the world. Your little friend, Maine, booked and busy, but for Vermont, yeah, it's a little under par. So what'd you say? It might take you a while, but a hundred souls. I'll give you yours back. 200 souls, shit, I'll even return the twin that I take, provided you can supply all the necessary deliverables. I'll write something up. But in the interim, works just as good. Who's it gonna be? Ooh. Hello? Can I help you? Oh, hi. I, I need a room. Of course. What brings you out this way? Oh. Sorry, I'm just trying to get away from a few things for awhile. Clear my head a bit. I've been driving all day and some morning I just got in the car and drove and here I am, I guess. Well, lucky for you we have a room available. Oh, great. This should do it. Perfect. If you wouldn't mind, almost forgot, - bit of an Eagle Inn tradition. - Sure, sure. Care for a stroll around the property?
