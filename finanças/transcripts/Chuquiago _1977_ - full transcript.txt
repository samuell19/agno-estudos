An Aymara legend goes: Wira, the builder God made a valley At the foot of the Illimani mountain, saying: "Chuquiago, thou shall be eternal. Protected from wind and hail." The Spanish conqueror drove a name into your entrails: La Paz... Thy name belongs to legend... Spirit of the mountain Illimani, welcome us, God of the city of Chuqulago, at your foot we deliver the life of our boy. Isico that is the lady. We have brought you the boy. You were supposed to come the other day, I thought you had forgotten. Does he know Spanish? Yes, he know a little. He was sent to school. I'm going to send him to night school here. It's good you've brought him... he's going to learn more. He isn't lazy, is he? I don't want a lazy boy. He is diligent, he runs like a goat. We're going to miss him, he's very fast running errands. I don't want a lazy boy or anything, I want a good boy. Yes even if you don't pay him give him plenty of food. Don't ask me about food, I have enough. I even feed the dog and pig. Behave just like you do at home don't be lazy, a liar a thief. Don't be sad, we will come to see you. Well then... leave me the boy. Yes, we leave him with you. What a life! It's so tiring. We have arrived, boy... you will live here, do you like it? Unload yourself, come put the thing here. You're not in the country anymore, you have to get smart. You're tired, aren't you? Each thing has its place so we can pick it up in the morning. You sleep here. We get up early around here, we have to go far tomorrow. Eat this, you have to get up early, do you hear? Wake up.

Do you have to talk Spanish to live there? Of course to you do. Mrs. Candicha, and your boy? My boy? He's always with me. He doesn't have anywhere else to go. At the beginning, he was a little dumb, now, he is getting smarter. But he is lazy and he makes me angry. Country boys are always like this, sometimes I have to box his ears. Even if he hates me, I'm going to make him a good worker. I need an assistant, let's see. Wanna work with me? Nah, he don't wanna his wife would divorce him. This one! Sure he can work with me. Your hair OK? No, it's not, it's very greasy, we'll get rid of that grease with "motacu" oil. This beautiful little red one we'll mix it a little... it's tops! You'll see what a job it does...

Take a look, ladies and gentlemen, is it clean? It's imported from the United Stated, made out of pure palm oil. He wants "gringas", blond girls he says... He doesn't want a "cholita" or "se?orita", blondies, he wants. This is your only chance, raise your hands all of you who want to buy. Great! Everybody wants come. Let's start... One here, another there... we have enough for everybody... What's happening, boy? You oughta get outa here! What's wrong? Get up! Who said that?... The other one was saying... hurry... Get out, god damn it, I'll kick your ass outa here. He oughta leave a "ten" for the "room". Why are you sitting here in the way, kid? People can't walk by. You're just sitting around. Carry this. Do you speak Spanish? - No, I don't. - Where are you from? From the lake area. Put the oranges here. Turn around... put the big ones on top.

During the fair we have to sell all these oranges. This cloth is for you. You'll unload oranges with this from the trucks coming from Yungas. You can help lady shoppers also, but you will help me first. You have to be careful, not to spoil the oranges. With this cloth you'll earn money helping ladies. It's difficult to earn, one has to work hard. You have to gain the good will of the lady shoppers. "Can I carry that", you have to ask them. Can I carry that? Will I take you it? Yes, take it to me. Hello maestro Pedro, we were waiting for you. Hi dad, look, we've brought the banner to show you. Here it is maestro look... What a nice "cullawa" costume this is Pedro. It's beautiful... they only finished it a while ago. Little Johnny, here is your clean shirt. Thank you mom. Let's toast our banner. It came out pretty good. Would you like to go to the movies this afternoon? Later on we can go dancing. With the deductions it comes to 1400 pesos, at most 1450... that's all I earn! There's no union nor union leaders, No one we can complain to, nobody! Hi fellows. So long dad. Look at him, "the gentleman". Where is "The Golden Gate Bridge". Marta? Is in San Francisco California. Very good! Whose is The river tent? - Fernando? - It's a man. What's George? Rosana? He is a dentist. What's Alex, Isaac? She is a journalist. What's Jim? Lupe? Jim is a dentist. What's George? He is a teacher. This is "Chajwaco". He's studying agronomy in the U.S. He's Making a lot of money, he even had a car. Hell, I'd love to go to the States. By the way, the other day I cut out this newspaper ad, maybe it will interest you. Give it to me, ok? - Yeh, I brought it for you, bye. - Bye. Martita, let's go to the movies, we'll just make it on time. I really can't, Johnny. Aw, come on, let's go. I'd get home late and my mother would scold me. I'd take her scolding gladly, just to be with you. Martita? Hello uncle... Johnny wait for me a moment. - Hello honey. Hello uncle. What are you doing with a "cholito"? He's a classmate, uncle. Get in the car. I'll take you home. Bye. You scabby chola, look what you've done. I said "sorry"... Chola?... Look at yourself... Good evening. Good evening my boy. You must be hungry. Have this soup with "Chu?o". I speak Castilian mother! Don't talk to me in Aymara! This Indian boy's forgotten his Aymara. He doesn't know to work, he doesn't know Aymara, he only knows how to yell at his mother! And you don't know how to eat! ... please eat properly. Why do you stay in this house? Why don't you leave. Here we eat "chu?o". we talk Aymara, you kid brother dances the "cuilawa"... Right You're ashamed of your family, your people. Well, you are ashamed of your father. Why aren't you ashamed of no working? Because I don't let them exploit me. You kid brother works, your mother sells, I work... But they give you peanuts. You're the only one not working. You've worked 20 years as a brick layer, what's improved? Look at your torn shoes. We're paying for you to study and amuse yourself, you can't complain. I won't shut up! I can say what I want. If someone bothers me, I'll smack him. You're the only one who doesn't complain, they exploit you, humiliate you - you can't even complain. Don't talk like that to your father. And don't you call him "Kept", what I earn maintains him. I want him to study, you should be proud of your son. Sure, he's proud, to slave for others, to be a worker. Your roof's built by a worker, even your bread's made by a worker. You get the worst house, lunch is bread and a soft drink. Your clothes are made by a worker, you're a worker son, and Indian boy. I'll be something else. Poor thing, who's this Indian boy think he is? A gentleman will never allow you at his table. I don't want to be a goddamn Indian! I'll leave! Get out! Lazy bum! For god's sake Pedro, please. Now you've kicked him out! He sets a bad example and just makes everyone cry. What's up Johnny? Well, looks like this tasty beer's going to flow! Hi, Wattiras! How are you, Matias? Listen, these "cullawas" can drink, but nothing like the "morenos" up the hill. This morning I saw half the courtyard full of beer cases, 200 dozen quarts just for the first day. They spend 8,000 pesos per head, they have dough, pal... The other day example, I met one of the "moreno" heads, man, he's loaded! he lives right around the corner, this guy was carrying bills in a sack, 100, 200, 300 bundles, I was getting dizzy, man! His fingers, full of rings, man! They say he owns 5 or 6 houses, at his door Impalas, he's a real fat cat, pal. By the way, I thought you didn't like these Indian dances. Don't believe, man, I like those little things... Look at that plump girl, she's not bad for a night What are you doing here! I'm looking for a place to sleep. Can I stay here a few days? You had a fight with the old man again. Say, Beto, brother, lend me a few bucks. You're a pain always the same thing, here. Twenty pesos! That's nothing! Can't you give me something else That's all I have, I spent a lot on my costume, and other debts, anyway the old man will take you back. What do you say Johnny, how's a few shots? Thank you, pal.

This mother - in - law of mine... She cooks so well that I wouldn't remarry so as not to lose her. Carlitos took my notebook, and won't give it back. Carlitos give her notebook back before I get mad. Stop fooling around. Your mother is coming for lunch tomorrow. I'm going to tell the lady not to come. We have to play the rent. - So long, mom... - Bye.

We owe an installment on the knitting machine. You know what I make help us, Carloncho, look at the things I did this month, or should we return it? Come on, put your apron on. Are you listening to me? Remember? You disappeared when you got your first bonus. - Bye daddy. - Bye my girl Bye mommy, bye daddy. The same thing happened last month. You spent all the money. I'm warning you: I won't take any more. I know what you're getting at: my "Friday night out with the boys." God save me! What would a public employee's life be without his Friday night... Debts, lack of money, his boss, the office the children's tuitions... and all the rest. Carloncho! Ok, ok... Take it easy, don't get mad. You'll get spots on your face. Bye. Send Rudy to the office, alright? I'll send you some money with him, bye. Lift it a little bit. Don't let it tilt. More to this side... Lower it now a little bit from behind. Hold it. Turn around. Hold it, slowly, Carloncho was a swell guy... That's for sure. Slowly, slowly. You can take care of this deal yourself. Leave it to me. Listen, ask for 800 and tell him it's to "oil" the inspector.

Good morning, Don Manuel. You know, Don Manuel What do you want, Lopez? You see, my sister's sick and I need money for medicine and the doctor bills. So... what else? I'd like to ask you a favor, could you advance me 300 pesos? But, please deduct them from my next paycheck. But, it seems you have problems every Friday, my dear Lopez. Just a coincidence, Don Manuel. Mr. Velarde, how's my paper work going? It's on the boss's desk; then it goes... I know you can do it. Impossible, it won't be out before Monday. It's quite simple, just take a look. You'll have it this afternoon. Sir, please look at these papers. Can you help me? I don't understand you... What can I do, just take a look please. Come back on Monday. But come from very far... No, get out on Monday. Panchito, call the janitor, he can translate... Just wait a minute. If his problem's solved, I bet he brings us a chicken. You sure need influence here to get help. Before there were numbers. When your turn came, you were helped. But now it's different. Your friends are first, before someone who's been waiting all day. I waited all day, isn't it true, young man? You saw me. What do they pay you for? What do you do? Do you work? Come back tomorrow... Hey man, take care of that old bag. It's been the same old thing for six months. When are you going to help me? Lady, lady, please calm down. Why are you yelling so much... First you send me upstairs, they send me to the 4th floor, they send me here, why don't you agree on who will assist me? Sure... Everything is ready. Don't worry... I'll be there in half an hour... Perfect. A pleasure talking to you, Mr. Caceres. Get some inspiration for tonight. - What's up? - I don't know but Coco does. A foursome with Carloncho at the Oruro bar. Mr. Toranzos from the Ministry of Revenue, yes, sure... Go right ahead, please. How are you, Mr. Caceres? How?s everything, Toranzos? We'll take care of it, just like last time. Carloncho was never angry. That's true. It seems that was his way of defending himself. He faced the harshness of life, the lack of money, and injustice with good humor. Oh, Carloncho... he had to die in order to be understood by us. We'll never hear his laughter again... Here's a table. These two stay here. Just leave them here, man. These dice are ok. This guy's right, the other night he made some broad scream. Who...? This guy, she was yelling "why don't you pay me..." Bring 6 beers, a piece of paper and some sandwiches. To from teams let's deal two from the right, ok? Agreed. 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. They go, we go. To the blondie that never cheats... And the others, even if they pay us badly. As for me, even if they don't pay me. To mother earth. Your health. Is the "field" drawn up? Ok, it's "you" and "us". Who are "you"? - We, of course. - And "us"? - You, of course. And who are "you"? Don't you know us: Rodriguez and Toranzos, at your service. - Ok guys, let's kick it off... - Two dumb deuce. Well, well. Three little dumbies. - Three dumbies... - Your family, right on. The boss, the boss. Don't call him, man. Hi, so you are here too. You should have told us you were coming. Once in a while won't hurt, will it? Go ahead, I'm with some friends. Have a drink with us, dear boss. - Come on, Manuel... - Some other day... Bien. Just one, cheers. I know how to greet them. That I have greeted you Cheers, cheers. Well, when do we get together? How about next Friday? Same time, same place. We'll see who has a better hand. We'll be waiting. And we'll leave the office earlier, right? Sure. We'll "work" the extra hours here. And double for the winner... Have a good time, guys. So long, Manuel. This guy is very henpecked by his old lady. She won't let him out on Fridays. Don't you see he's considered a saint... Why? They call him "saint-of-a bitch". - Four. - Come on, lucky ball... - This is the last shot... - It's now or never. Just beautiful, pal. - What? - We were looking that way! But I saw it he made the game. Here, Carloncho, play like you know how. Ok, it's alright. The silent one, you'll see... A sleeper! No cheating around here, man... Your doesn't count either then. We better ask for the bill. Waiter... We'll pay fifty-fifty. Why should we pay fifty-fifty. Carloncho, pay up. You were trying to pull a fast one weren't you? No, I didn't forget, what a thought! So much the better. Comrades, fellow party members: we?ll establish a more just social order. 200 for you... 200 for you, because you also have family 100 for you. Gee, why only 100 for me? - You don't even have a broad to support! - You're only an amateur! Who's he to give me only 100 pesos? Who am I did you say? Don't you know who I am? You don't know me. This is who I am. We can't see you, man. Here, this is me, you understand? Here I am next to the chief. Compa?ero Caceres is on the other side. This is Comrade Caceres. Where do you think these "extras" come from? You should know that we've led this country. We've led masses. Yeah, in church. We were in the mines, the countryside... We were with the peasants, the miners, with the humble, with the workers... And now he asks me "who am I"... You bastard. Hey look, you who am I... Bah, it's like throwing pearls before swine... Finally, I'm going to drink to the Chief. Hail to the Chief! Who made history...! What of it, mother f...! What's the matter with you, sit down! You're drunk already. No, I'm not drunk. Then, hand over your 50... ... To talk to me this way... - Come on, pay up. - Here, here. Waiter... - Here's 180, keep the change. - Thank you. - Let's go see broads, how about it? - Girls? Sure, man, we'll get a boy for you. Hey Carloncho, let's go to the "Kilometer". Good idea, not one centimeter less. Let's go! What about your Chief? Wow, sorry, Chief, come along and we'll move some real masses! Let?s go, let's go! Carloncho... friend... brother. I'd like to say goodbye in the name of all your friends at the office. We will always remember you, and we will defend you forever. Some people have said that you died this way or that... Lies! Who could criticize your life... You did not know vacations, leisure or luxuries. Your only amusement was meeting your friends to play dice and have a few drinks. That was your sin: a sin of "a Friday night out with the boys" Rest in peace. Thank you. Cumbia... "By the grace of God, I am single... ... who cares if I die... If I get drunk it's my own money. With this broad, with the other broad... happiness is our goal..." Here comes my bus. So long. See you at the office. Patricia - Hi, mom. - Hello, dear. Imagine, we didn't have class all morning. Hi, Patricia. - They fired our sociology professor, - One of the best in the faculty. But we're not going to stand for that. All of Sociology will meet tomorrow to consider what to do. Ma'am, you have a phone call. It's about the buffet. This time we won't tolerate it. We'll organize with the Literature department. I'd like you to listen to my speech for tonight. Charo phoned me this morning. She says aunt Ines has arrived. Ah, aunt Ines? Aunt Ines...! What a headache! Will she stay long? Only a few days I think. She plans to be at the cocktail party tonight. Speaking of that, I would like you to be there an hour early. Go with your friend Sarah. In the small car. Don't forget everything has to be in order. Last year's experience can tell us a lot. New Year's Eve, Remember, that Lopez is not to be trusted Now, my mischievous Patricia, let's get these meeting out of your pretty head. Let's worry about our concerns. I want you to come with me tonight. I'll expect you around 6:15. I hope you'll dress-up. Dad, please, I'm in the middle of mind-term exams. I have a lot to do. Besides, It's a square party. I don't know why you plead with this snob. What matters is that I'll be there. No, you do whatever you want around here, just like a spoiled child. You're at an age when you have to take some responsibilities. And in addition, you represent the family in this act. You'll come with me! It's time you get serious about your father's affair. - Sir, you have a phone call. - Thanks... Excuse me. Patricia, this is very important for your father. It's your duty to go, dear. You must understand: you are the eldest. Don't offend your father, Patricia. It was the chauffeur... He couldn't find the address of a poet... Artists! They live at the top of the hill. Tonight I'll wear that sharp velvet suit you brought me from the States. You know I don't like to wear those rags, but I'll do it for you. Miss, there is a call for you. - Hello. - Hello, honey... - Oh, hi Toto. Let's go together to tonight's reception. - No, you better go by yourself. - I'll pick you up... No. I don't think so... Well, thanks anyway, so long. In its most recent expressions, the Latin American novel assumes new forms of artistic creation, new forms of interpretation of reality and a new vision of man. Writers like Carpentier, Asturias, Rulfo, Cortazar, Vargas Losa, Garcia Marquez... have created a literary trend that reflects the problems of this continent... in a more profound and authentic manner. Now there's a topic that's been under debate for several years. It is the engagement of writers. It analyzes if the writer should... Listen, several compa?eros were arrested including the Federation leader. - So what? - We're holding an emergency meeting. - Can I go? - No, the meeting is right away. But I can skip classes. Listen, I only came to tell you I can't meet you later. Besides, your party comes first. So long. Out of their country. There are some who assert that this reality... provides elements and experiences to the writer so that he in turn to create, express and re-create them... - Hi, Carmencita. - Hi, Patricia, how are you? And my father? He'll be free soon. He's with Dr. Vargas. Any news? Yesterday I got a letter from Fernando. It seems he'll stay 4 or 5 months longer. They postponed his scholarship. I'm desperate, you can imagine, after so much time... I was informed by an absolutely reliable source that new economic measures... I'll stay home this week because my sons are starting to think I am a guest... They broke in expecting a political meeting and found them smoking pot. Your attention, please... Ladies and gentlemen... Please. The presence tonight of Don Ernesto Caceres is a memorable event. He's conceived a plan of noble initiative... He was a Minister of the MNR. That honors the work that he is going to do... It gives me great pleasure to present to you: Don Ernesto Caceres... Regretfully me friends, cultural life in Bolivia is not fully developed. Neither the arts nor literature have the strength of our political expressions, or the boldness of our economic activities. Given these facts. My company, as a representative of private enterprise, wants to encourage the noble artistic activity in Bolivia. My plan is to encourage artists, writers, poets... by incentives, giving annual prizes to the most outstanding work in each field, just as works of art win contests art galleries. We've established the Arts Promotion Foundation with 5 prizes of $5,000 each. Besides, there will be exhibits and publications, here and abroad. Oh, boy, I can't think anymore. I'm a little drunk. Nobody's asking you to think only to love me. But I love you, dear Toto. Your charm's irresistible. When you want to, you say intelligent things. But you can say silly things without really trying. You tell me I silly things, but you do silly things. Silly things? Yes, for example, the idea of going to the University. What's wrong with that? There's lots of talk of violence, revolutions, social change, etc., those're the chimes you hear... meeting, demagogy. You call this "studying"? You'll see these aren't only chimes. Until last year all I know was what type of eye shadow to wear at every hour. I got up at 11 or 12 and I had to go to silly tea parties. Not now, Toto. Collage has taught me a lot. I have friends who think and have ideals. I don't waste my time. I want to study. Meanwhile, while you study, you're saving the world. If you just want to show off your sarcasm, you better take me home. Patricia, you know I admire you. I also admire you, Toto... as a liar. - Hi, daddy. - Hi, Patricia. - Mom. - How was your tennis? We played four sets: Georgy and I against Beba Martin... Patricia, there's wonderful comment on the, cultural prizes in VISION. How much did you pay, daddy? Nothing, my friend sent the article. Did you know the Catholic University paper wrote about them? No, I did not know. What's it say? That your prizes give prestige to your social class and you name. Second, that culture always gives prestige, but it doesn't help the people. What else does it say? Your prizes are bourgeois ideas, for the consumption and benefit of the bourgeoisies. - And finally... - Patricia! How can you say those things, you know that all the media has praised the idea. But college students didn't stop to think that the money doesn't return to me, it goes into the pockets of poets, painters, writers, people that I have nothing to do with. Dad, don't take it so seriously... Thanks Mom. Half of what I said is my own... at college we criticize everything. That's what you learn at college! Dad, I don't know why you listen to these commies... They spend their lives talking nonsense. Do something useful, Ferdie, bring me the telephone. Don't you have feet, don't you have hands. Patricia, Toto called you he wanted to invite you to a party where Teche Gutierrez this Saturday. - You're problems at your University... - We are in an emergency... - I know... - From the press you don't know much! Look, what I know about your blessed University everyone knows: students go there but they don?t study a thing. Hello... yes ma'am, would you please see if Rafael is in his room? He isn't... well, thanks. Rafael's never home. I think he sleeps at the University. So, comrades, I think we should adopt the proposed plan. We've talked enough. We shouldn't be dilettantes. How long before we take any action. This five- point plan is the only correct thing to do now. I propose we get right into action. We can't take any more provocations. Wait, this plan only contemplates immediate goals. it doesn't consider our main objectives, ... autonomy, joint co-government, freedom in teaching, and our link to national realities. I ask for the floor, colleagues. We know the government wants to close the University, you needn't be too smart to see that. A blockade now gives them a perfect excuse to do it. That's why I question the idea of being pushed into a blockade. I think there are a few here who'd like to give in... In our language, master! Okay, but until all the delegates arrive we can start analyzing our plan. The way we're handling this is going nowhere. Comrades, comrades! I'd like to tell you a brief analysis several of us made. We propose the following steps: first, it seems clear the university will be closed down. For the sake of unity we should create a parallel University... but considering the lack of leadership, and infiltration... Our struggle is part of the general struggle, we are not vanguard.. We should make contact with the labor organizations, the miners... One moment comrades! The University's surrounded! The cops are all over. Don't panic... Rafael, they're looking for you... They look for you too Jimmy. Attention! Students, the university is surrounded! You have 5 minutes to leave! I repeat! You have 5 minutes to leave! The university is surrounded! You would be safe at home, Rafael, the guest room is ready. Don't worry Patty, I'll take care... I never wanted to interfere. It's good you're coming to your senses. Mom, something unites Rafael and I that you'd never understand. You'd have to have the same ideas, be in college, be young again. Patricia, I was also young once, the boys then were quite different. It's not like in your time, mother, the world's changing. We have to change! Our country's full of problems and only we young people worry about that, About how working people live. Our dog eats better than the majority of the people in this country. You've really changed lately. You never talked like this. Now you just repeat what you hear in the University. It's not proper for a cultured young lady of good family. Mom, if asked you to talk with me it wasn't for a lecture. Let me speak to you. I'm very worried about Rafael. Your father and I have been very tolerant of your relationship. I can't conceal you especially now. That we do not approve of this friendship. A person with dangerous ideologies, who does not want to study, is not convenient for you. What can he offer you, Besides, what kind of a family can he be from...? Mom, please! We'll never understand each other. You're too narrow minded. Who cares Rafael's family is. I admire him, he's intelligent, sincere, humane and a good student. Patricia, our only worry is your future. We've insisted on your going to study in France or the U.S. That you go to know the world. I already know the U.S., I don't want to live there. I admire your love for our country, but you should see it from abroad and with another mentality. My problem is something else, I've told you... right now, I'm very confused. You're finally realizing that. Your father and I have discussed it and we came to this conclusion: you were serving him as a secretary, as a crutch, you were inflating his ego. i think his interest in you was for appearances' sake. You see Patricia, he's selfish and doesn't care about your feelings. Has he called to find out how you were? Hi Juanito, how are you... I'm worried. Did you find out anything about Rafael? ... You don't say... You don't say... Patricia, congratulations! - Congratulations! - Thank you, very kind. Thanks. - Congratulations! - Thank you. What a beautiful gown. I'm glad she married Toto, because the relationship with Rafael... - Had to end badly - Besides, look what happened to him. What happened to Rafael? Well... some days ago he was arrested and well... he was exiled from the country. Any coincidence with people or real events is purely accidental.
