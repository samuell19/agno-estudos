Come on, you're gorgeous. Let's go. Ten seconds. Five minutes. What the hell are we doing in San Pedro? Bride wanted a view of the ocean. What could be more romantic than a wedding on a beach? Ooh, if it was sunset, and the evening mist was coming through the clouds. The smell of bird shit and diesel fuel. Stop it! Right. Good luck to you both. Maybe we should get married. That's the least romantic proposal I've ever heard. Do you get proposed to a lot? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I'm gonna go talk to this guy. Hey, Yuri, right? Scott. - Hi. - I go to Max's. Oh, yeah. I've seen you around. - Yeah. - You know my sparring partner. - Troy. - Troy. Seems that they like each other. - Oh, your building project. - Yeah. - Your mother was saying. - Thank you. I mean, you work your ass off, you can make it here. You know, you make money. Money gets you power. Power gets you respect. Respect gets you even more money, and all that money gets you a beautiful wife who just wants a bigger house. That's a problem I'd like to have. Oh, you will. Mm, yeah, I can see it. You're not a guy who's happy just punching a clock and collecting your check. You got drive. You got ambition. Initiative. Like me. The forecast, plenty of sunshine through today, with seasonal temperatures, we should reach our... - Mm. - Hey. Hey. Don't work. No, I'm not. I think that's it for today. I can bring in a half a crew a couple of days. Nah, it's all right. Our loan's coming through this week. We have to get this thing up, you know. Gotta get people moved in. This neighborhood, you're gonna have people fighting to get in. Your lips to God's ears. Vamanos! Take care, man. Hey. You guys are running out of money. No, no, no, we got a loan coming through tomorrow. It's what I've been doing all day. Can we cover tomorrow? - Nope. - Shit. I can always ask my dad. We've asked him all we can. Same with my parents, grandparents, friends, neighbors, strangers. And that's what this was, man. Finishing it is on us. Maybe... maybe we lay the crew off for a couple of days. For what? Raise a few 1,000? If we're not pulling in rent by the time property taxes are due, we're screwed. It won't take long, and this place won't be ours any more. Nicky, we're gonna get the loan, all right. This is one of the most desirable and affordable neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Mr. Novenchenko, Mr. Yerevanski, I'm sorry, I can't approve this loan. If it were two years ago, maybe three, it would have been approved, but times have changed. It looks like you've liquidated all your assets to get this far. Yeah, we have. This is our whole life. We're gonna be charging between 1,800 and 2,200 dollars a month, pulling in a total of $30,000 a month. Just need 700-grand to finish the construction. That's all. It's a what, eight-year loan? Why don't we say five, or four years? I'm sorry, that's not how this works. Let's say a ten-year loan. - Mr. Novenchenko... - Nicky... - No! No, Scott. - Nicky... You're supposed to fight for what you want, right? This is what we want. I'm sorry. Rules are rules. Nicky! Hey, Nicky! You think that's how you deal with people? Screw you, Scott! You said this was a done deal! We have people working on our site right now! No, we don't. I already called Julio. - Why? - She left me a message yesterday. She said she had trouble resolving a couple of the issues. A couple of issues?! We lost the loan! Well, want do we do now? Well, Nicky, there are other banks. I'm sorry, but even with an expedited loan our process still involves an evaluation period that can last from six to eight weeks. But we have all the paperwork right here. This is how we do business. I know how you do business, my dad has been with you for over 15 years. Of course, I know your dad. He's a wonderful customer. Is he willing to provide collateral? No. I would give you all the money in the world if I could. But we're just getting by, you know that. But you have to know somebody, right? - Who? - Who was that man you were always talking about? Viktor? - Oh, Rashnikov. - Rashnikov. Right, Viktor Rashnikov. I know the seventh richest man in Russia. Two-point-five billion dollars. I went to school with his sister. You think I can just call him up? The way you talk about it. You're right, it's stupid. But when you come here, you barely speak the language, you're a nobody, so to impress people I would say that I'm a friend of Viktor Rashnikov, and they say "Oh! Viktor Rashnikov." Like it makes me very important. Stuff it. Do you think he remembers his old friends? I called him several times, left long messages. Never called me back. It's nothing just starting from nothing. It's a struggle all the way through. And that's why it's so hard for me to watch you struggle now. Baseball. Always baseball. Soccer, now that makes sense. You run, you try to score, you run back. In this baseball you have the rules, and the counts... and the counts, you have outs, you have runs. And then you have home runs and homers. Yeah, Dad, those are the same thing. Tell 'em if it's the same thing, call them the same thing. Well, I think you have 300 channels here, I'm sure we could find you a soccer game. Oh, no, no. Leave it. We watch and you explain. Would you help, please? Come, sir. - Lookie here, my son. - Let's go home. When are you gonna give me grandchildren? Oh, Dad. I think I might need to drive him home. Good to get to know you. It was nice to meet you, Yuri. - Have a nice night. - You too. Somebody has a crush. My dad came here with nothing, made some money, and still drives the cheapest car you can buy. I'd rather be like Yuri. Let's go. This... is gonna cost you an extra 200 bucks. All right. Thanks. The next time you need it... I will be here. I'm not asking you, I'm asking about people you know in business. Look I know people who would buy that property from you as is. This would become yours. Ah, think about it, would ya? Go ahead, Mama has some lunch for you. So how did it go? I tried... Yeah, I know. You know what, I think you should talk to Boris Kutenko. Nicky's mother knows him very well. But he's a criminal Criminal, gangster, he started out that way, but now he's into private security and he owns businesses. Legit. I just don't think Nicky would go for it. We said from the start that we're gonna do this by the book. Does he have to know? I don't think so. - Absolutely not. - It's just a suggestion. Do that once, who do you think's going into you next time? Don't you think every red flag in the bank is gonna go up when they see Boris' name or some other crook shell company on there? Think Scott. You're supposed to be the smart one here. Hello? I was just calling to see if you're okay. Uh, how come? Well, when we talked last night it sounded like you had everything riding on this loan today. How did you hear about that? The woman at the bank, the supervisor, she's a friend of mine. She thought I could help you out maybe. I'm gonna be at Max's in about an hour. I don't have much time today, but you could swing by then. I may have some ideas for you. Uh, all right, see you there. Who was that? That guy from last night, Yuri. Said he might have some ideas for us. - Hey, you guys made it. - Yuri, this my partner, Nicky. Yeah, we half-met last night. Yuri Stojanovich. Nicky Novenchenko. Sorry I had to bring you guys in here. - It's the only break I get. - That-that's fine. I'm kind of interested to know what kind of bank manager gives out confidential information. I'd kind of appreciate it if that was just kept between us, you know she's a friend. - You wanna know how I know her? - Well, yeah. What do you know about me? Not much. Give us a minute. I know that woman from the bank because I was the guy who spent three years making deposits of big, giant bags full of quarters. But those thousands turned into tens of thousands. Tens of thousands turned in hundreds of thousands. And now, I pay four guys to do it for me. - Quarters? - Yeah. I own some laundromats. Yeah, people don't think much about 'em unless you use them. And then you don't like 'em. People want them clean, and they don't wanna have to use six different dryers before they find one that works. When you come to mine everything works. And I bought the spaces next door, I put in convenience stores on one side, coffee or donut shops on the other. How do you think they do? Those people don't pay in quarters. So you wanna hear my ideas Nicky Novenchenko, or should I just go fuck myself like you wanted to say since you walked in the door? Actually, since you called... He's trying to help us out here, Nicky. No, that's okay. That's okay. I respect a man who says what he thinks. Doesn't mean I have to like him. See you guys later. There are people in this world who have a lot of money, and sometimes that money needs to go somewhere else and then come back. They just need to pay taxes somewhere. Investing in small business lets them cut that tax in half. You'd be surprised how many people ask if they can invest my businesses sight unseen. Here's the money, have it back by such and such time. It's completely legal. There are people, people we know, who still think the best way to make money is get one over on the government. It's old world thinking. So you have somebody in mind for us? Scott. Nicky. Nikoli Lavinski. Pleased to meet you. Pleasure mine. What's your line, Mr. Lavinski, if I can ask? My line? What do you do? My line. I'm cigarette exporter. I-I don't know what Yuri's told you, but we're building an apartment complex, and we're... - putting in every dime. - We're putting in our own sweat. Right, but we're coming up short. Boys, boys. Please. English not great, so may have wrong. But I could give two shits about this. You need money, Yuri says 700 thousand, but I have seen your place. I think more. Maybe one million? You tell me. You think I'd waste time coming here, listen to two boys telling sad stories. I guarantee you terms are fair. I just want to get back money when you agree to give back. Understood? Yeah. Thank you. Just like that. Those are good boys, they pay back. Are you drunk, Nikita? We got the money. Really? Mm... I'm here. Why didn't you call me? Sorry. You celebrated without me. Oof, two bottles worth. Bastard. Where's the money coming from? - We found an investor. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Who? A friend of Scott's. Yuri. Hey. How did he get involved in this? - Well, he called us. - He called us. Just like that? Uh-huh. - Hey, Nicky. - Come on, business later. - You don't even know him. - Oh, come on, we got the money. - Let's celebrate. - Cut it out. Cut it out. You're drunk. Get out of the bed. I'm very tired, I want to sleep. Hello? We got the money! Yeah, I know. I was there, remember? No, no, we got the money, legit. No more under the table loans from some dodgy Albanian cigarette exporter. What are you talking about? Yesterday, after I talked to my dad, he went to the bank and put the store up as collateral. I think he felt bad. Anyway, this totally sets us up for the next property. Nicky. That's our money you're spending, right? Ah, no, I thought Scott called you about... Hey, you don't know what you're walking into, I'd stand back. Hey. Hey, we had an agreement, right? You cashed the check, the money left Lavinski's account, and now it's going back into the account... Yes, I have business with this man. I assume you like getting paid in cash. It all comes from somewhere? right? Scott, what the fuck, man? We had a deal. All right, you're that guy? The guy who signs a deal and then tears it up the next day? Do you know how much went into that arrangement last night? I, uh, I had no idea. I'm... I'm really sorry. Great. So we're back on. Well, no sorry, I stopped the check. They'd-they'd only transferred 11,000, the other 689,000, that's still in your account. Oh, no... Fuck you. Tell me... tell me you did not fucking do that. Do you know what they're supposed to see when they look into that account? Nothing. Do you know... They're gonna see a transfer of almost a quarter of a million dollars. That is a big problem for me, for Lavinski, and now for you! Yuri, I didn't know, okay. - I'm really sorry. - Oh, you're sorry? That's fucking great when you bump into somebody at a store, or you hit their car with a fucking shopping cart. That's, I'm sorry. Look, what can I do to help? What are you doing, man? Fuck this asshole. What-what can you do to unscrew me? - Is that what you mean? - I could... I could call the bank. I can tell them it was a mistake. No, that's done, they see evidence of a transfer of the money in that account. - That's over with. - There's gotta be something. Look, I'm-I'm sorry, guys. I just, uh... It's just a lot for me to take today, you know. I don't know, you said you'd take care of me over the phone, right? So pay me out of your business, uh, out of your payroll as a consultant. I'll send you an invoice, and I'll take care of Lavinski. Yeah, that's something we can handle, we can do that. Yeah, is that... What do you think? Is that good for you? - Fuck no. - All right, that's the plan. I'll send an invoice. Thank you. I'm sorry about the-the throat. Would you fuck her? She's a little skinny for my taste, but she's reminding me of my first girlfriend. That's a yes. Yuri. Girl's beautiful. Young too, right? Younger than us. You her first? Her first, uh, real boyfriend, I mean. What am I saying, California girls... right? They all get started so young out here. You know, it makes me worried for my daughter actually. Here you go. What's this? Oh, it's my invoice. I know you're busy, I didn't want to bother you at the constructions site. How did you know I'd be here? You don't get a tan like that at the mall. Right? I'll leave you to it then. Uh, Yuri... Sorry, what is this? It's my invoice. I counted for my time, the arrangements with Lavinski, the meals, the hotel. It's $7,000. - Hey. - Hey, uh... - Hi there. - Brooke, Yuri. - Hi. - Hi, nice to see you. Yeah, nice to see you too. You don't think I met this guy off the street, do you? No, I had to work him, I had to convince him you guys weren't con artists. If you saw that amount of money being spent to woo you, you'd pay attention, wouldn't you? Hey, look, I'm just gonna need a minute, I'll be right over. Okay. It's just a lot of money. You didn't ask me what my methods were, how it was gonna do it, you asked for my help. Now that's less than a one percent commission for my services. In that time frame, for that amount of money, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone else to give you that kind of deal. Besides, you've got it, right? You've got a 100 times that, in fact. That-that is all budgeted for down to the last penny, it was one of the conditions of my dad supporting the loan, is that he got to oversee all the expenditures. Your dad's a businessman, he'll understand. I'm still gonna have to talk to Nicky. Really? I thought you were the brains, you were the-the money guy. I am. He's still my partner. Okay. Cool. Give him a call. We'll wait to hear from you. - What was that? - Just business. What do you mean, "business"? We needed the guy's help. All right? Well, it doesn't seem like you got it. I need to call Nicky. All right, Scott... - Talk to me, Scott. - I can talk to you... - What's going on? - I can talk to you after I call Nicky! Can we just get in the car? Fuck. Jesus, I don't know why you're acting like such an asshole. Nicky, Scott. Guy got that invoice from Yuri. That's just wrong. We-we offered to make good, remember? And, you know, apparently he'd actually done a lot of legwork on this. I saw it as a friend helping out, where he, uh, he saw it as a business deal. A friend? Fucking parasite. Where are we gonna get the money from? From the loan your dad backed. Morning, Scott. Morning. Listen, I gotta apologize again. I hope I didn't cause too many complications with that letter yesterday. It made for a couple of complications, but it's all right. - How much is this? - Uh, 2,500. Oh, don't worry, you're gonna get your money. Get in the trunk. What the fuck? What is it? You're coming with me. Who do you think will win? You are so tough, huh? That's how your wife likes it, or just what she tells you? Why did you make me do that? You're not the one I meant to hit. Scott Yerevanski, Nicky Novenchenko, meet Ed Plume. Ed works for the City of Los Angeles emptying parking meters. As it turns out, that same tool used to empty those coin boxes can also be used on certain makes of washing machines. How much money are you into me for, Ed? I can't... I can't. I'll tell you, $126. That's 504 quarters. Do you know how much that weighs? That's a lot. I'm gonna let you off easy, Ed. The boys here know I'm big into percentages, so let's say ten percent. Okay, 50 quarters. Don't steal from me! Have I made my point? I'll take that as a yes. And I'll take the 2,500 from this morning as an apology. You'll get the ten percent deal, too. Each. Every day I don't have my money, add on 20 percent. Counting today, you now know me $8,400. If I don't get my money by the end of today, tomorrow it's 10,080. The day after that... Well, it's a lot. But you can always take your chances. Nicky. We're all right. He was just trying to scare us. What the fuck are you talking about?! He attacked us, he's got gun! We have to go to the police. No, that's the last thing we can do. I'm on my way home, all right. He asks for 7,000, you gave him 2,500? - I thought he'd go for it. - Well, you're a fucking idiot! We're in serious shit now. After all we've done to keep this on the right track. We knew from the beginning there were guys like this asshole out there, that could make things easier. - But we wanted to do... - I fucking know that! - Stop it, Scott. - I had no idea yours was a friendship so fragile. But seriously, I can, uh, give you ride somewhere if you need. No? Brooke. Hey. You remember me, right? Yeah, of course, how are you? You're an actress, right? Uh, yeah. I'm trying to be one. - Yeah, well, that's obvious. - You know, it's... You're doing a pretty good job of it. Thank you. - Okay, so it was good seeing... - Wait, wait, wait. What's your problem? I mean, that's why you're working out today, right? Is to one day be on the big screen, look sexy for all the cameras. That's-that's why you're here, I'm paying you a compliment. Okay. I'm sorry, um, thank you for the compliment. - And I... - Wait, those people, they're paying for the privilege, right? - I forgot, you don't have much in the way of pockets, so... - You don't have to do that. Whoa. Dude, don't fucking touch me! - What, what? This is your job. - Stop! This is your job, right? I mean, wait, this is... This is what your job can be one day if you're lucky. We're having an honest conversation, aren't we? Hey, man. What do you think you're doing? Oh, my God. Oh, that's great. Now this asshole's gonna sue me or something. Tell him it's a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding. Tell him you're sorry. I'm sorry. - Tell him you're sorry. - I'm fucking sorry, okay! Please! Good, thank you. I meant it, by the way. You look great. Here. Tell Scotty he can add this to the tab. Oh, you still got it, huh. Hey. All right, all right. Stay right there. I'm gonna come and get you. No, Scott, please don't come to get me. I don't wanna see you right now. Because you weren't here, you don't know. You don't know what he did to me. And it was fucking terrifying, and it was the middle of the fucking day. So, no, Scott, don't come get me! It's not about a few thousand dollars. A guy like him is after much more. Whatever it is he's after, he's pretty good at getting it. Okay. All right? Where are you from? Voronezh. I know. Shit town. Black earth, full of peasants. No wonder you came to America. You two have a verbal agreement. It sounds like he has a recording of you agreeing to commission. Then you agree to not only pay the invoice, but then also the interest rate. - Under duress. - Oh, yes, under duress. - He threatened to kill us. - In so many words? He took us to the back of some laundromat, he showed us a guy he was torturing, and then he proceeded to bash his fingers with a couple of rolls of quarters in a sock Is this true? Yeah. When I opened this store there was a guy like that who came around, threatened to burn down the store unless I paid. So I paid for months. When the man I was leasing the property from found out what was going on, he sent two of his brothers to break the guy's arms and legs. He said there's only one language these people understand. I know a private security firm. First, they put up cameras. Guy like that doesn't like his picture taken If that doesn't work but he still comes around, they'll send a couple guys to the site. You do not fuck with Yerevanski's. How you doing? How's it going? Good. About to get better. Nice not to have to chase us for change, huh? You got that right. - Get the fuck off my truck. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Is that anyway to be talking to your new boss? I'm gonna take care of you from now on. What the fuck? Look at it. It's counterfeit. Come on, come play with me. This is gonna be easy. You do this right, we're going to be partners We're gonna be making lots of money. Real money, not this bullshit. Hey, motherfuckers! Come here! What'd I tell you?! When you when you fuck with my guys, you're fucking with me! You've been paying us with counterfeit bills! No, I got them from the bank this morning. They have all the same serial numbers! That can't be possible I got them from the bank. I wanna choose to believe you. When you come up with the money you owe my guys, call me. After a week, I'll call you. How much does he think we owe him? By the end of today, $14,515. We gotta pay it. Can't. I'll sell my car. I'll pawn whatever's in my apartment. If playing this guy's game and letting him win means this is over, that's all I want. I'm sick of this. Thanks for not pretending this isn't my fault. Yuri. Yuri? Oh, hi. Uh, is Yuri here? No. Okay, uh... Well, let him know Scott came by. I, uh... I have his money. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Shit. What? You want me to try again? No, I'm... I'm just kinda distracted today. It's all right, honey. You'll be okay next time. Here. What do you want? Haircut. Ana Koslov from Moscow, right? Shit town, full of dogs, full of pollution. Can't take the subway without smelling of shit for days. No wonder you come to America. What do you want? Haircut. Go ahead. See what becomes of you. Excuse me. Turn it off! It's Yuri. Hello. How are you? I really think you'll be pleased. It's Brooke. Come on, come on. What? He's gonna make a deal. Cheers. Yuri. Mr. Lavinski, good to see you again. What is this about? There's your 14-grand. I mean, it didn't sound like much money, but jeez, when you're strapped, you're strapped. Yuri's a standup guy. Watched him break a man's knuckles for a 100 bucks. Doesn't take shit from anybody, huh? Big-time gangster. You let that little boy talk to you like that? Those funny little boys? In front of those men? How are my people supposed to respect you now? - Look... - Maybe you're not man I think. Maybe I get rid of you! At least they got balls... Hey! You fix this! All right. Family won't even let me see her. They're just really freaked out. - Give them a sec. - No. They know that if it wasn't for me this wouldn't have happened. Yuri must've known she left me and just done it anyway. She was insurance. There's nothing left, we're out of options. We should go. Where? I don't know. Anywhere. My parents are here, I-I can't. He can't find me, what do you think he'll do to them? I don't know. Everything I've got is in that renovation. It's our future. I'm not gonna give that up. We shouldn't stay here tonight. What's on your mind? I don't know what to do. You don't want to talk about it? It's complicated. If I have to do something bad so that I can do something good, - is that still a sin... - Are you asking me as a priest... or as your friend? Both. - Can I help? - Yes, you can tell me what to do. God knows that life is complicated. That's why the Scriptures are very clear. But it's not enough. Turning the other cheek will not work. As you friend, I would say... protect yourself. Try to do no harm, but keep yourself safe. Be true to your heart. There are no answers, only choices. It doesn't look like much, but if you add 'em all up, you got a lot of money. I come in here twice a day... every day. I always do it myself. - I don't trust anyone else to come get my money. - Hm. - You always take care of your own money. - Okay. Daddy wants you to come help me do this one day. - Okay. - All right. Let's do this. No, no, no. That is not how it's gonna end. Scott, if I wanted you dead, I would've killed you a long time ago. No, what I need from you will only happen if you're still breathing. It's just a signature. Well, four actually. Let's go. He wants full ownership of Nicky and I's property. He wants majority ownership of the store. And he wants our help with the bank to extend him a line of credit. Yeah, and just to make sure, you know, it wasn't just about us. These are my mother's rings. She's had 'em every day I've been alive. She's worn them. This one's from her grandmother. This one's from her mother. This one's from her husband. You know the only time she takes him off? It's when she washes the dishes of an evening. Puts 'em on a ceramic plate on the window sill. When she finishes she puts em right back on. Except for last night. I need to reach Boris Kutenko. Boris? Boris is a very dangerous man. - He's a criminal - I know. Oops. - Nostrovia. - Nostrovia. Mm. Here, look at this. Lavender from France. Salvia from Mexico. Olive tree, over there, from Greece. From Afghanistan. All immigrants, all of them struggling... for life and water. That's why we're here together today. Ah, he got you scared now. Go on, admit it. Yeah, he's got us scared. Yeah. Not a good feeling, is it? No. Well, I have looked into him. - You have? - Yeah. A guy like that starts operating in my arena, of course I have taken an interest. Oh, not because of your mother, no. His name is not Yuri, it is Vladimir Ubiriya. He's from St. Petersburg. His mother sells souvenir dolls behind the Winter Palace. You want me to kill him, well, it will cost money. All I need is just partial ownership of the building, a silent partnership. A good one. Ah, 50 percent. You want him dead, those are my terms. - All right. - All right. Yuri! Come quiet. I'll kill 'em both. Where we going? Why don't you just shoot me here? That's not how this is gonna go down. Go. It's Yuri. Boris is dead. He's never gonna stop. I know, where... Where are you now? Hi. I'm on my way. I'll be there in ten minutes. Hi. - Help! Help! - Shh... No cutting remark tonight? You're not so brave without your Nicky around, huh? That's it. The last tenant.
