Nearly as big as your house, Twiggy. - Nearly. - Yeah, nearly. Whoa, whoa. Whose is this? It's mine. What's so funny? Nothing. I just always wondered who actually lived on these things. Do you want to grab the other one? Just untie it. Have you ever been on one of these before? - No. - No? It's so quiet, bro. I could live out here for like a week or something. Maybe even longer, you know. You can think clear, you know what I'm saying? No noise, no cars, no nothing. No people shouting and shit. - I might get one of these. - Yeah? Yes, when I'm older I might buy one. Red and black. What would you call your boat? I don't know, mate. Leon's boat. That's shit, init? Leon's boat? Leon's boat. Oh, Leon's. Obviously I'd get a good deal or something. Here you go. You take it. Oh, man. We should do this again, you know. Yeah, man. Who are the murderers? Police are the murderers. Who are the murderers? Police are the murderers. People have taken to the streets in protest to what they claim is the killing of an innocent black man at the hands of the police. The protests were sparked after it emerged that the non-police issue handgun in question was actually recovered from the drawer in the man's home and therefore wasn't in his hands at the time of the shooting. The word on the street is that this was an execution and the community are not happy. Well, the situation now is that there is an intense standoff. A cordon of police officers are holding back the crowd of probably about 200 odd people. These pictures were taken earlier today on the streets of East London. Community leaders from the area have repeatedly warned the police that trouble is likely and they're urging them to go out into the community and provide reassurance. But the police has stated that their hands are tied as they can't be seen to prejudice an independent investigation into the... I was watching that. - Tea? - Yes. What's wrong? Leon, just talk to me, man. What do you want to know? I don't know. Hum... Who your mates are? What, you want to be my friend now? - Lord, yes. - Why? Just trying to make amends, that's all. I know I haven't always been there for you but... I'm trying now, ain't I? What's with this Chris guy? Chris? What about him? What's he doing here? Don't worry about him, he's harmless. Well, he's better than your fucking dad. Oh, come on. Let's not go down this road again. Yes, Chris is a bully. I'll have a word, I promise. Let's just forget about it, okay? Listen, umm... why don't you, umm... treat yourself? Buy some new trousers or something. No, just take it. I don't want your fucking money. Straighten your toes, lift your heel. Hey. Yes? Do you have any work going? - Sorry? - I'm looking for work, or work experience. Sorry, man, I'm a bit up against it at the moment. That's it, that's it. Push him back, push him back. Keep your hands up. Leon. Leon, focus! Come on. That's it. That's it. Get back. Oi, oi, oi! That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Calm down, bro. Calm down. What's the matter, Leon, man? Come on. Here, man. - Are you alright? - I'm alright, I'm alright. The death of a man in one part of London has triggered a wave of violence in neighborhoods in the north and south of the capital. In Hackney, the disturbances began in the early evening. The police said they would have more officers on the streets today and here they have moved in in force. What is the good in times of economic difficulties in raising and destroying businesses that are the lifeblood of our communities and that give people jobs. All around this area the cordons are going up. For the second night running we've got copycat acts of violence. This is what the police feared and what they are calling pure criminality.
