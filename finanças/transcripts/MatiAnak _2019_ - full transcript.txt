- That's a foul! - What? No, it's not! Goal! What are you doing? I won! Kiki, Muti, help me hang the clothes up to dry. Come on, Bon. Get the ball. No, you get it. - Let's go get it. - No, you get it! Timmy, Fariz, come. I don't want to! Fariz! Boni, you go inside and get it. No way. But you kicked it. Timmy, go get the ball. Why me? I was passing the ball to you. Had you caught the ball, it wouldn't be there. This is all your fault. It's my fault, huh? Hurry! Be careful. I heard there are ghosts living inside. What is it, kids? Nothing new, Ms. Ina. Boni kicked the ball too hard. And he blamed Timmy for that. You know, Boni is a coward. What are you afraid of? Boni said there are ghosts living inside. Let me take a look inside. - Ms. Ina? - Ms. Ina... Ms. Ina? Boni! I didn't see any ghosts inside. Don't try to scare your friends if you're afraid yourself. Here you go. I'm not afraid. - Let's go. - Let's go. Come on, Boni! You will be the goalkeeper. Which one of you broke the window? Say it! - Come here. - Sir! I'm sorry, I kicked the ball. They need to be disciplined! I know, but it was an accident, they're just playing. You have to pay for that window. Hey, you see? Everything is going to be okay if Ms. Ina is around. - What did you say? - Nothing, nothing. What are you talking about? Oh, that. I was talking to Timmy that you are so beautiful. - Especially when you're not angry. - He's right! Be responsible next time. Don't let other people take the blame. Do you understand? Yes, miss. You're not grounded. Really? But you have to do the dishes! That's what you get! Ina. Sir, is this all we have left? Just make do with it. Sir, that's not enough. We're regular customers. The least you can do is give us the usual price. Sorry, but that's the lowest I can give you. - Ali? - Yes, Koh? - Where are Mr. Tomi's things? - It's right here. Hurry up! Cheapskate! Thanks! Have you got all? Doesn't he have any heart? Doesn't he feel any pity for the kids? If everyone has mercy in their heart, we won't be working in an orphanage. What is it? - Let's pull over. - Okay, I'll pull over. - Keep going. - What's going on here, sir? Uh, there's a... A whole family has just been murdered. How did it happen? I have no idea. Please, keep going. We don't want to block the traffic. Thank you, sir. Okay. Be safe. I never knew you can repair a window. You know what? There's a lot that you don't know about me. What are you doing? What if the kids see us? They're not here, relax. You like it too, don't you? Thanks for defending the kids. It was nothing. I really don't want to cause you any trouble. I just couldn't bear to see Mr. Ruslan being mean to them. Do you think he's getting grumpier recently? Did you see that? Are you okay? I'm fine. I told you to be careful. This is nothing. -I'll get something to treat it. -Actually, a kiss from you is enough. Jaka. I can't do it, sorry, Gus. Come on. Just for a while. It's not about how long it is. Hi. - But we can't have another kid here. - My name is Ina. What's yours? It's just one kid. How hard could that be? It's still a person, not a cat. How should we feed him? So what should I do with him? Take him back with you. Sir, please, just accept him. Are you stupid? How should we feed him? It's just one more kid, we can do it. After all, it's only for a while. How long is it for "a while"? One day? Two days? Three days? One month? One year? Four years? Sir, I'm sure we will find a way. Tell me what is it? I will take full responsibility. You hear that? She will take full responsibility. I'm off this case. Thank you for having Andi here for a while, Ina. I will make sure people give donations to this orphanage. Thank you for trusting us, sir. You are welcome. I am the one who should be thanking you. Come on, follow me. Who is that? Look. This is a chubby bear. Come on, dear. Don't be shy. What? Wait here. Ina. Hi, what's your name? Who is that? Come, follow me. Come on! We're hungry! Hurry, Boni! It's okay. Come. You will get yours. Relax. Kids! Kids! Shut up! Kids, this is Andi. He will be staying with us from today. You have to be nice to him, okay? Yes, Ms. Ina. Shut up! You scared me to death! I got scared too. Go quick. Don't be stingy. Why did the power go down? How should I know? The eggs are delicious. He probably forgot to pay the bills. Why don't you eat? Aren't you hungry? He must be sleeping. Boni, wake up! Andi. Andi? What are you looking at? Let's go back to our room. Mr. Rosman will be angry if he sees us here. Come. Andi? Andi? Timmy, what are you doing outside? I went to the bathroom. And then? And then I saw the yard door opened by itself. Opened by itself? Yeah. I also saw... What did you see? Stop saying nonsense. Go back to your room. Go now. Now! - Where's the ball? - One, two... - It's my turn now! - Okay, wait a second. What's wrong, Timmy? Last night I saw Andi walked outside alone. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Go ask Bleki. - Let's just play. Do you want to come with me? I'm heading to town, but no one wants to come with me. I have many candies. You know... ...when I was your age... ...I also lived in an orphanage. But my caretaker was not very kind. She often punished me. Fed me leftovers. And I always felt cold at night. But I won't let that happen to any of you. I care about all of you. And you are safe here. Come with me, okay? Here. I can give you Rp70.000. Sir, this is not my first time here, can't you do better than Rp70.000? That Rp70.000 includes the cost to clean it. I know, but it is not enough. Fine, just take it or leave it. Let's go back. Ina, wait! I'm sorry, I miscalculated. Here. I'll give you Rp150.000. How about that? Yeah, of course. Thank you. How did it go? I heard a whisper inside. What kind of whisper? Like a lady's voice. Like what? Boni... But I just ignored it. Now... No! No! Come here. Listen! Five minutes, alright? Do not scream or make any sounds. - Open the door. - Okay, time to go! Go, go, go! - Close the door! - No, stop it, guys! - What is he doing? - I don't know. Timmy... Timmy... Timmy... - You coward! - He is a coward! - Coward! - Are you ashamed? Kids, I brought something for you! It's Miss Ina! Slow down, or I will take it back. But you have to take Andi to play with you. Yes, Miss Ina. Take one. You won't get one! Rafi! I won't! Ina, do you have to spend your money like this? It's alright. When was the last time we saw them this happy? - I want another one! - No way! - You dare to say that? - What are you going to do? Andi, what are you doing? Boni. Look, it's Andi. Look, it's Andi. What is he doing? - Where is he going? - I don't know. Let's follow him. Let's go. - Should we follow him downstairs? - Yeah, let's go. Why should we follow him? Just come. What are we doing? Come on. Fine. Be careful. Already... Already... Already... Already... Already... Already... What is he doing in the shed? I don't know. Late night like this. Let's tell Miss Ina. No. Let's head back instead. - Come on. - Let's go. Take the ball. You take it. You're the brave one. Take it. Help! Open the door! Boni! - What are you doing? - Open the door! Move aside. Open up! I cannot open the door! Open up! Open up! Open up! Open up! Please open the door! Boni! Calm down, Boni! - Miss Ina! - Boni... What were you doing outside anyway? Mr. Rosman, we saw something upstairs. I saw something too. What did you see? There was... ...a ghost. There are no ghosts! Bring them upstairs! Hurry! Hurry! Go upstairs. Adit. Yes, sir? Have you found Andi's family? Not yet. What takes so long? Put that inside. Thank you very much, Mrs. Rita. Your donation means so much to us. Don't mention it. It's from the people. I've never seen you before. Well, I rarely go out. I myself recently involved in social activities. It would be great if you can ask others to join you. Social activities, huh? Why today? Please, enjoy your tea. Thank you, sir. - Do you know who is this? - No, who? R-o-s... Ros... Rosman! Why you little brat! Don't you have any respect? You little brat! Help! Stop it! What are you doing? Don't try to interfere! Look what he did! You saw him drawing that? I saw him here drawing this. What is the proof? It's... Where's the chalk? Where is it? Mr. Rosman? Kids! What is it, Mr. Rosman? Siti! Ina, I'm sorry. It's okay, you can forget about it. What happened to me? You don't need to worry. All you need now is to get some rest. You're not getting younger. You have to know your limit. Thank you, Ina. Who did this? Who else? It must be that fatso. Ina. How long are you going to work in this place? You know I never consider this as a job. But you know... ...I have been saving. And my salary is adequate. So actually, you don't need to work anymore. What do you mean? I mean... ...have you ever thought about getting married? Or at least have another life besides this orphanage? Of course I think about that. But you know, these kids do not have anyone. At least they have me to play with them. Ina, don't you realize? You're not going to be here forever for those kids. I know. But I will try to always be there for them. I know! Because I also want to always be there for... ...the kids. Tonight is Kiki... Congratulations. ...Timmy... Congratulations. ...Andi. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you. Rosman! Dead. Run. Run. Run. Run. Miss Ina... Miss Ina... Miss Ina, what is that? Miss Ina. Don't look! Miss Ina, what is that? Miss Ina, be careful. Be careful, Miss Ina! - What is that? - Be careful, Miss Ina! Timmy! Siti, are you okay? Siti! Don't come here! Don't come any closer! Siti! Get back, kids! Get back! Siti? Miss Siti! Siti! Get out! Miss Ina! Where are you going? Ina. You have to get out of here. What about the kids? Don't you remember what happened last night? I know we're afraid. But we have to stay strong for the kids. Ina, listen to me. This house is not safe anymore. You have to get Andi out of this house! - Don't say that. - Get him out of here. You can't say like that. - I'm sorry, Ina. Don't wait for me. - Siti. Siti. Siti! Siti! What are you doing here? This is all Andi's fault. Ever since he came, this place became haunted. Yeah, all of us are afraid except him. Don't you find it strange? You can't say that. But, Miss Ina, Timmy said so and we also saw it. Andi suddenly disappeared. You must not say that. He's your friend. No. Andi is not our friend. - Yeah! - He's right! It's all because of him! Andi caused this chaos! Yeah, just blame me. Come on! Miss Ina. Thank you. Miss Ina, we're sorry. I just want all of you to stop saying that to Andi. Do you understand? Yes, Miss. We don't have anyone else but us. We must not blame each other. But I promise. As long as I'm here, you will all be safe. (The Mysterious Death of Cipto's Family) (One of the Children Survived) Dead. Run. Ina... Ina? Who are you? Get out of here! Ina, it's me, Jaka! Ina! - What happened to Miss Ina? - Ina? Ina... Ina... She's alright now. But she's recovering, right? - Yeah, you can relax. - Okay. How could this happen? I don't have any idea myself. Maybe she's just tired. Now you try dip it in the tea. Try it. No, you have to split them first. Dip it in the tea. It's good, right? Miss Ina! - Miss Ina, are you alright? - I'm okay, I'm okay. Miss Ina, Boni was being naughty again. No, you liar! Ina, I'm going to check the front door. Ina. What if... What if I stay here for a couple of nights, until you find a new caretaker? Are you sure? I'm happy to help. I understand how hard it is to take care of kids. Especially this many. That could drain you, mentally. I respect you. Up until now, you keep taking care of the children. I imagine myself being alone in this world. No family. No parents. Dead. Run. Dead. Already. Run. Dead. Already. Already. Run. Already. Dead. Run. Already. Dead. Already. Run. Dead. Already. Kids... Kids, wake up. - Wake up. - Get behind me. - Anna. Anna. - Anna? - Anna. - Anna? - Anna. - Anna. Already. Dead. Run. Dead. Run. Already. Already. Run. Dead! Anna! Let him go! Let him go! Miss Ina! Be careful! Anna, stop it! Die! Die! Boni! Boni! Boni... Boni. - Hello? - Hello, am I speaking to Mr. Adit? It's me. I am Agus. I just want to tell you... ...that your brother, Wahyu Purnama has passed away along with his family. They're all dead? How did it happen? Please take care of the kids while I'm gone. Don't worry. Leave it to me. We are still investigating the cause of the death. However, your nephew Andi survived. Andi? Jaka, stop here. I'll take a look. You're thinking of going in? Yeah. Ina... What are we doing here? Looking for something. What are we looking for? Andi's family came to me at the orphanage. I think they were trying to tell me something. We need to find anything that could give us a clue. Alright. I'll go and check inside. Ina. Look. I think I have seen this before. Strange. Already dead. Run. Dead. Run. Dead... Dead... Dead. Dead. Already. Run. Dead. Run... Run... Dead... Run. Run. Already. Already. Already. What happened? I don't know. You suddenly passed out. Are you okay? Here, let me help you up. Are you okay? Dead. Run. Already. Dead. Run. Already. I keep hearing those three words, but I don't know what they mean. "Already dead, run." What if they were trying to warn us all along? But what are they warning us about? And who's dead? Please let Mr. Agus know that we're looking for him when he returns. This is extremely important. Alright, I will let him know. By the way, thanks for the donation. Really helped. What do you mean? This is the donation for the orphanage, right? We've already received half of it. We just collected the donation yesterday. The rice just arrived this morning. And we've never sent any of them. But a woman named Rita said the donation was from here. Do you know anyone by the name of Mrs. Rita? There is no Mrs. Rita in this town. Ina. Ina? Ina? Ina? Ina? Ina? Ina? Ina? What are you... Ina? Ina! Ina. Ina? Ina! Boni! Help, miss. - Who did this? - I don't know. Watch out! Mrs. Rita? Mr. Roy? What are you doing? These children... ...are mere device to resurrect our long awaited king. They should be happy. Their meaningless life... ...finally can be useful for a higher purpose. You're insane! What are you doing to Andi? That kid is not Andi! Ina, get out of here! Hurry! Your Majesty... Listen, Ina. Two years ago, they came here... ...and they wanted me to cover their identity. Sir, my nephew Andi passed away three years ago. My brother, Wahyu and his wife were very devastated about Andi's death. We have become very distant and never keep in touch anymore. That's because they're almost insane. They were involved with some kind of cult. Until one day, the house burnt down. And then they disappeared without any trace. At first, I had no idea. But since they paid me a lot of money... ...I did nothing. But I know now why they had to run away. So who is Andi exactly? Let's get out of here. Come on, sir. - Ina, just go. - But, sir... Save yourself! Run! Quick! Save yourself! Where are you going? Jaka... It's no use trying to fight our king. His will shall be fulfilled. No! No! No! Jaka! You think you can run from us? You will become sacrificial offerings to our king. You're crazy! He's just an ordinary kid. He's no ordinary kid. He is our true saviour. We worship him... ...to inherit all his power and wealth. Look at what happened with Andi's parents when they realized... ...what they were trying to resurrect was not Andi anymore. Kill them all. - Miss Ina. - No! No! No! - Please help us! - Please don't do it! I will do anything you want, but please don't hurt them! Grant my wish... I want to be rich! I want to be rich! I want to be rich! Your Majesty... ...we have done our task. We submit our soul as your servant. We swear... We swear to serve you and worship you until the end of the time. So in return, as you promised... ...please fulfil our wishes. And this is... This is our final offering to you, Your Majesty.
