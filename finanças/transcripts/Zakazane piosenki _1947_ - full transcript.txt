FORBIDDEN SONGS A SONG IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS FILM. NAÏVE, SIMPLE, REAL SONG. DURING THE HARDEST DAYS OF OCCUPATION, IT WAS ABLE TO MOCK THE ENEMY, UPLIFT THE SPIRIT, AND BRING SOME OPTIMISM. AND THAT IS WHY IT DESERVED A FILM. This song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl Maybe your heart full of love Is at loss too Maybe you keep your love in secret? And you sob through the night? The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl. Why are you so glum? Memories, my brother. That is what brought us here. It's time for celebration. It's all over. The occupation, the Uprising. Pour me some, Jurek. This song doesn't work on you, huh? I like it. Guys used to sing it in Scotland. In Scotland? Very funny! There, you could have sung whatever you wanted! You should have tried it with the Germans. From what you're saying, it wasn't that bad. - Have you gone crazy? - What is she saying? - He;s mad! - But you said that... - You're a dolt! - Wait, guys. He got confused. So you say it wasn't that bad during German times? If you were allowed to sing such songs in public... - in front of the Germans... - Even the worse songs. - You see? - Jurek. Where are you from? - Is that a new joke? - It's not a joke. Answer me. Where did you grow up? Don't make a fool of me. In Skawina. You should have spent more time in Warsaw. And less in England. You don't know Warsaw. - Sorry, guys, but... - Calm down. Stop arguing. I'm not arguing. You see, the situation was terrible. You know that, even though you were far away from here. There were round-ups, street executions, Majdanek, Auschwitz, Pawiak. Each family suffered during that time. There was also our fight. AL, AK, Peasants' Battalions. And we had yet another weapon we used in the streets of Warsaw. You all remember it. It was a laugh and song. And it was a pretty good weapon that kept our spirit up. Oh yes! Germans were scared to death. - They did they best to cut it out. - And they failed. In Warsaw, nobody cared about their prohibitions. A lot of singers ended up in Auschwitz. - Many of them lost their lives. - What's this lecture for? Sit down and tell Jurek that story you told us so many times. How Warsaw fought against Germans with a song. - He is one of the heroes. - Oh, come on! A natural modesty. - Play it! - Sit down and play! All right. But don't you ever say that we were doing nothing but singing forbidden songs. Come on, I never said that. - You wouldn't dare! - Sit down. Good. Let me warn you once again that this is not a national epic. It's just a story of a forbidden song and our memories attached to it. Some of these memories come together. The others create... - Stop talking, start playing. - Play. Wait... One second... Where do I start... No, no, no. The beginning was different. This is how it started. October 1939. Germans have just entered Warsaw. The war is lost. Hopelessness. Warsaw in ruins. It's nothing compared to the Uprising, but then we thought it couldn't be any worse. And the first forbidden melody came up. The first revolt at the ruins of the Warsaw National Philharmonic. In the beginning, there were few musicians. And then... Is your brother home, miss Halinka? - Yes. What happened? - A very important thing. Romek, someone to see you. Hi, my friend. Sit down. I don't have much time, Mr. Tokarski. Grab your instrument! - Where to? - That's a laugh! Come on! He lives a few steps from the Philharmonic, and he can't hear it. No wonder, since you are knocking all the time. Come on, sir. And? Can you hear it now? The Varsovian! - Where? - Who is playing? Who is playing and where? We are playing! Varsovians! We are not afraid of the Germans. This is just the beginning. England and France have just joined the war. Hurry up! Take your instrument. I'm coming. Mom, where's my jacket? Halinka, give me my violin. All right. I must move on. Wait! I'm ready. I have no time. I must tell the others, including your neighbour. Mr. Cieślak? No chance. He is scared to death. Come with us. Hurry up. - To the shelter? Is it an air raid? - What raid? - So what happened? - Oh, come on! A rebellion! For destroying Warsaw, for the philharmonic! We're playing the Varsovian. I'm ready. Let's go! You will find out when you get there. We will be waiting, Mr. Cieślak. Mr. Neighbor, you have to! Romek, your hat! Aren't you going? - Where to? - Don't you know? Oh, against the Germans. With a bayonet and rifle. And with my violin? You are so timid. I'm just careful. - Come on, mom. - Bring me my coat. Oh! They're still playing. God. Why put yourself at risk? Wouldn't it be better to wait until Easter, until the war is over? This would be a good moment to play the Varsovian or the Marseillaise. Easter? What a pessimist! Who would survive six months of the war? It will be over for Christmas. VALERIAN It was not a forbidden melody. Come one, Romek. I can't listen to it. You remember how they tortured us with it? The army, the party, even their children, the Hitler Youth. They loved to sing it on every occasion. It was a special occasion. They wanted to break us down. They did it on purpose. But we did not give up. We returned with our song. You remember? Let's drink wine, chevau-légers... They used to sing it before the war. And during the occupation... It was September, just after midnight The power of the battle squadrons Appeared with the hum of the engines And turned the silent night into hell They bombed towns and stations While everybody was asleep When we expected nothing They struck a brutal blow The defenders formed a wall Their bayonets shone in the morning sun When the fight felt went, they shouted And pushed the enemy back And then the aircraft appeared To support its ranks Our eagles were not there So we have to move back We were retreating from the city gates Chased by the queue of tanks There is no need to cry for the country As this misery will not last long There is no need to cry for the country As this misery will not last long Amen, our poor soldiers. This misery will not last long. The Krauts will fall soon, right? Sooner than you think. I keep saying that. Forget about what these rags write. They won't trick us. We have better news. "When the black eagle falls broken, when he turns his eyes to the east, Poland will reclaim the Masurian land and Gdansk will return. In a vicious fight against the Teutonic arrogance." Enough. - Stop it, please. - What happened? It's a samizdat. Burn it right away. Their ears are everywhere. You expect nothing, and then... Ah, hello, neighbour! Good morning. I've been reading our new prophecies to Mr. Cieślak. Nice, isn't it? - You are so timid! - Careful. Just careful. Guess what I brought, mother. - What? - Come on. - Is it fixed? Really? - It is indeed. I am so happy. Halinka will be delighted! You see, this is our family heirloom. Our mascot. It was constructed by my grandfather who was a watchmaker. Just look at it. What a beautiful piece. Right. It's nice. - Does it chime? - Of course. You will hear it. What? The Varsovian again? Isn't it a wonderful sound? For God's sake! Stop it! You will bring misfortune. It is a forbidden melody. It's like having radio in your house. Aren't you exaggerating a bit? Our neighbour is just very careful. This is how you should live these days. It's the only option, ma'am. These are very dangerous things. Dangerous? Can't you hear what they are singing? They are not afraid at all. Just listen. On September 1st That memorable year The hostile neighbour attacked Poland They showed no mercy to our Warsaw Our beloved Warsaw They flooded you with blood You used to be beautiful and rich And now all I see is you dust Churches destroyed, houses burnt down Where your people can find shelter? The bombs are dropping all day long There is no water to extinguish the fire A mother keeps seeking her child's body She is calling God and cursing the enemy They were torturing us like this for more than three weeks! God will punish the Krauts For their awful crimes! What I am singing now Is just unbelievable There will be the end of my tale God's grace is with us We will rebuild Poland What are you writing? Howdy, Halinka. Sit down, please. - I'm noting this song for Romek. - This one? He already has it. - I thought you were writing a love letter. - Only to you. Black coffee, please. How are you doing? Bad news. Only German successes. All lies. Don't believe these rags. Alack. The radio says the same. It's impossible. Do you know what they say in the city? Food riots in Berlin. The whole army from the Government went there. There is not a single soldier in Warsaw. Only the officials. Today, I myself saw... Don't worry, Halinka. Damn them all. Cheer up. Smile. There will be a day when... Beer, please. Don't beat yourself. It's a waste of teeth. You see! Excuse me a moment. - Howdy, Jurek. - Hi. - What's up? - Nothing important. - Today at 6, as always. - Where? - Same place as yesterday. - Done. - What are you writing? - Nothing. Just like that. - I thought you were writing a love letter. - Only to you. You're so lovely. Remember it. - By the way, this evening... - Just as I thought. - You are busy again. - Are you mad at me? - Rysiek. - It's all right. We can meet tonight at 8:30 PM. Same place as yesterday. Fräulein... You think it's funny? I was so afraid for you. I had a feeling something bad had happened to you. Why? It's nonsense. Can you hear it? This melody brings misfortune. People say wherever this busker appears, something bad happens. Cursed melody? An adult lady believes in such nonsense. It's just a poor student. Axe, hoe, January, booze German and Italian lose their shoes Axe, hoe, rope line, wire to be put Mr. Painter is kaputt Axe, hoe, hand saw, bay Air raid by night, roundup by day Axe, hoe glass, ban Run away while you can! Axe, hoe, gendarme, blast Everyone is running fast There's no need to stay in the Citadel Or in another awful cell Axe, hoe, hand saw, meat This is Skaryszewska Street Axe, hoe, hand saw, two planks, sow We are in Skaryszewska now How dream? How to believe? Dogcatchers don't let us live As in their culture it is allowed to do this hunting in the crowd Axe, hoe, hand saw, bay Air raid by night, roundup by day Axe, hoe, hand saw, blow Take this note and let me go If you don't have any money You will be deported to Germany Axe, hoe, hand saw, thinker Here's the Prussia, there's Treblinka We have no more place to hide Dogcatchers lost their pride They are running through the street Looking for another meat As in their culture it is allowed To do this hunting in the crowd There must be something wrong with them Since they are coming after us Axe, hoe, hand saw, stainer The war is lost for the stupid painter Axe, hoe, hand saw, my frau He is losing now, now, now. Axe, hoe, hand saw, gas, tier When will they get out of here Axe, hoe, electricity and gas We will kick your ass! But not only the lyrics drove the Germans mad. Even the music aggravated them if it was Polish. Mazur, polonaise, kujawiak. It was all forbidden. Forbidden melodies. Those who came to forbidden concerts took a huge risk. But that didn't stop them. They were in Poland, even just for an hour. It was the miracle of Chopin. So it was worth the risk. Such concerts lifted people's spirits. Drag them away from the activates with the help of which Germans wanted to corrupt Polish slaves. German propaganda replaced music with some cheap tunes. Childish entertainment instead of theatres. Gambling in casinos. They wanted to enslave the souls. Why are you so happy today, Mr. Antoni? Great news. I'm not interested in politics. I don't want to hear anything! From a certain person. The war ends on September 15 at 3 PM. - It's official! - I can't hear you! Seven Englishmen have already landed. The end is near. Warsaw Courier, the latest news! - The latest news! - Kid! - What news? - Hitler lost his shoes! Long time, no see. Welcome, my beloved friend. Any news? Nothing. - Are you going to work? - I guess so. Did you hear? After that, supposedly... Radio says that Hitler has gone mad and it is for sure... Quiet, for God's sake! They hear everything. It's too risky to even whisper about it. Mr. Antoni? The latest newsletter. Read it and pass it on. Who is she? The former Maria Kędziorek. But now... MARIE KENDSCHOREK What a stunt. Mr Roman? - A cigarette. - Here you are. Thank you. I'm sorry I dared to bother you. I haven't smoked for days. - I'm sure you understand. - Of course. - Would you like to take some for later? - Thank you. Come on. I'm happy when I can talk to someone. So many months in hiding. And that thought... that I can end up in the ghetto at any moment. It's terrible. All I want is... Excuse me. FOR GERMANS ONLY The enemy attacked Poland He mucked the land It is because, Jesus is still asleep God will wake up And shout with his power: Drop dead bloody Hitler! For burnt cities, for burnt huts We will kick your ass! I am eating bread You ate some cookies You say you bought it I'm sure it was stolen! Although there are some Huns I'm not scared to sing Cause that bloody bastards Don't understand a word... Halt! Halt! GERMAN VICTORIES ON ALL FRONTS Stop, stop, stop! - What are you playing? - What's wrong? It's c, a not cis. What c? Can't you see a sign! What sign? It's a fly. So let's start again. Three, four! Raging Vistula is flowing at Cracow Dirty scumbags got comfy On our Polish land... For heaven's sake! What are you doing? It's a forbidden song. You can't even listen to it! We will kill a pig We will make some sausage With these sausages We will poison all The German cockroaches and rats I do not want to listen to this! Damn it! Where will I find new strings? You want me to go with you? You better stay. It's safer when a woman goes alone. But I don't know if someone is in the house. Here they are. Good morning. Good morning, sir. What are you so confused? Anything bad? Are you going to the shelter? Was there an alarm? No. We're going to the countryside to get some provisions. What provision? You are so timid. I resent that. I'm just careful. - Here. - Thank you very much. You want to see my brother? My string[s broken. I would like to borrow one. Romek has left. I don't know where... Oh, I see the case. Roman always put his spare strings there. Excuse me. What happened, Mr. Cieślak? It was the most dangerous moment of my life. Great job, miss. Boys will be so happy. I wish I could see them. My train leaves in five minutes. Anything for me? Right. There's something for you. Someone has to fix it in Warsaw. - Burnt? - I don't know. - This should be replaced. - All right. - They asked us to hurry up. - No problem. It's dark outside The train is crowded And the idyll begins He hugs her She's fat as a cow Chopped meat under her coat Something is dripping from her heart It's lard and pork, Plus two hams When he's admiring her body Some loin falls out With the unsalted beacon Now there's a war Who trades, survives When I sell my chop Lard, and blood pudding I will get myself some hooch Now there's a war Who trades, survives - Here you are. - Thank you. I will get myself some hooch Before he finds out What she has to sell The train stops at the station The gendarmes get on They take everything you give them The one is searching the pockets The other is looking on the ground And that one is checking the packages They took lard, chop And black pudding Damn them all! Now there's a war Who trades, survives When I sell my chop Lard, and blood pudding I will get myself some hooch Now there's a war It's hard to live on trading They took lard, chop And black pudding There'll be no hooch Put something in the basket. I'll but the Kraut a casket. Now there's a war Who trades, survives When I sell my chop Lard, and blood pudding I will get myself some hooch Now there's a war It's hard to live on trading They took lard, chop And black pudding There'll be no hooch Violin, right? Aber schwere. Violin. Heavy. Speck? Lard. Guten Appetit. Bon appetit! "Today is my gloomy anniversary. Two years of hiding. I haven't been in the streets for two years. For two years I haven't got close to the window. Good people saved me. And if it hadn't been for them, I would have starved to death." My Warsaw... My Warsaw... I cry anytime I see you Warsaw, my Warsaw! In the ghetto, there is Hunger, poverty, and cold But the homesick is even worse, My Warsaw! I'm sneaking across the wall And I'm running like a chased dog! Although, the authorities, the gendarmes The Gestapo, and the SS are after me My Warsaw! There is a tear in my eye I don't know if I will See you tomorrow, my Warsaw! I'm sneaking across the wall And I'm running like a chased dog! Although, the authorities, the gendarmes The Gestapo, and the SS are after me My Warsaw! There is a tear in my eye I don't know if I will See you tomorrow, my Warsaw! Although, the authorities, the gendarmes The Gestapo, and the SS are after me My Warsaw! There is a tear in my eye I don't know if I will See you tomorrow, my Warsaw! The red apple Cut into cross Why are you frowning On me, gendarme? Geese and duck behind the pond They'll catch you girl cause you're young You will give him a note He will give you up Look, a lady is walking with a Kraut She's so proud From the ghetto, her dress comes. Father, aren't you ashamed Of your beloved daughter? Of course, he's not He as well became a Volksdeuthe Geese and duck behind the pond You'll be a good nark cause you're young You will give everyone up You're useful to me, I'm useful to you The boys from the conspiracy Caught her at the gate They shaved her to the skin They didn't spare the perm When that didn't work They brought her some flowers Roses in one hand Machine guns in the other Geese and duck behind the pond He killed you girl though you were young She won't give anyone up There is no use of a dead nark... ...if this happens again, hostages will be executed. And now the follow-up of the massage of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. A fierce fight is taking place in the southern section of the Eastern Front. Our brave troops are fighting against the overwhelming forces. Our soldiers retain their relentless offensive spirit. As a part of planned movements, aimed to bounce off the enemy, the city of Kherson was emptied... The 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler stood out during those hard fights. It's ready. There is no hope for the enemies of the new Europe. German victory is inevitable. Because the Führer... Compatriots. It's Polish Underground State. Don't give up your hope. Our freedom is imminent. And now, military and political news. Yesterday, the Soviet troops moved 26 km to the west in an unstoppable attack. 246 towns were liberated. The 1st Tadeusz Kosciuszko Infantry Division is engaged in the operation. Yes? What? Unbelievable! Yes, sir! Damn it! Not again! Halt, halt! Is this her son? This is your son... in the photo? Yes. It's my son. Where is he now? I told you. He didn't say where he was going. Silence, finally. Let sleeping dogs lie. It was close. They were running around the town like mad dogs. Don't stop here. It's always safer at home. And your sonny is not here. The curfew is coming. Only Polish songs. Can you play it? I asked you a question. Yes. These are my notes. I can play it. So play it, please. Play! I'm getting bored. Play something! I don't know what. Maybe something forbidden! Deutschland, Deutschland über alles! Go ahead! - I can't. - Now! What are you doing?! Play "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles"! Polish pig! Hans! Sit down! Play something usual. Can you hear it? This is our piano. German melody? What's this? Nothing serious. Some old woman. What now? We can't go home. Of course. Never. We have to disappear. - That was predictable. - We disappear together, of course. - Absolutely not. - Romek! Neither you nor our mother is in trouble. Fortunately, there is nothing compromising at home. Anyway, they need you here. You know that. Who the hell? Wait a second. - Rysio. - Yes, my love? So we have to split up. It was bound to happen. You think about the resistance? I'm afraid for you. Don't laugh. Maybe it's because our experiences grew us together. Our fight together. It is, and it will always be our common fight. Although you are staying in Warsaw, and we are going to the forest. Maybe this separation will bring us even closer. Rysio. And? - Do you know who it was? - Well? Jurek. They know who ratted us out. So it was a denunciation? Do you remember that busker in a student hat? Him? You see? I told you that this melody brings misfortune. The girl started to cry aloud Her eyes shined with tears For the soldier's plight Her eyes shined with tears For the soldier's plight Be quiet, our willows Do not let heart-breaking grief Make you cry, my girl It is not that bad to be a partisan We are dancing to The music played by Stens There are bodies everywhere But we are not scared Be quiet, our willows Do not let heart-breaking grief Make you cry, my girl It is not that bad to be a partisan We are dancing to The music played by Stens There are bodies everywhere But we are not scared Whether it's rain or scorching heat - you can hear our measured footsteps... - What's on your mind? I'm thinking about what awaits us. - Are you scared? - No. I would be sorry for Halinka if... Why are you so girly today? You're right, Romek. Just keep playing. I like it. Fall in! I'll play it later. Ten of you will take care of the bridge. The others will support them. - Understood? - Yes, sir! Dismissed. Damn it. They should be here by now. I don't know why they're complaining. Maybe they are taking the whole train on their backs. - Krauts. - You think so? Follow me! 31 JULY 1944 1 August 1944 Where have you been? Everything's fine, mum. I've been waiting for so long. - Dinner is in the oven. - Thank you. - What are you looking for? - Nothing. You seem so strange today. Why are you dressed like that? - Hala, we are waiting for you. - I'm coming! - Are you leaving again? - I have to, mommy. What's wrong? I'm so scared. You sound like Mr. Cieślak. Goodbye, mom. I have an appointment. I heard that Romek and Rysiek are back. - Romek? Wait! - Later, mommy! Where are you going, Mr. Cieślak? What are you doing here? Can't you see? Yes, but you have always been so... - Careful, you meant to say. - Right. Nothing has changed. Germans know everything. I guess so. Aren't you scared? Me? Boys, come here! Tanks are coming from the station! Destroy them! Jesus Christ! They're coming at us! Can you hear them playing? I wish their chests would play like this. - What's going on up there? - It's all fine and dandy, sir. We came to breathe some fresh air. Will they survive? Don't be upset. Everything is fine, seriously. And you sob through the night? The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl It broke out from a young chest In a great internal struggle And followed the army Someone's heart full of love A soldier was marching along the road He felt sorry for this little heart So he put in his backpack And he kept moving The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl Maybe your heart full of love Is at loss too Maybe you keep your love in secret? And you sob through the night? The song, the only song... - Romek! - Howdy, Halinka! I finally found you! You look nice! I feel great. I'm just a little tired. Sit down. How's mum? Very good so far. But where's Rysiek? Don't cry, Halinka. I'm not crying. I'm singing. The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl The Uprising was over. And the song of Warsaw went silent. And the crowds of the exiles were only followed by the mournful chords of its last song called "With the smokes of Fires". Radio speakers used to sing it to us during the last days the of the Uprising as a consolation... Pruszków... Pruszków... Train to Oświęcim... Detrain... Aussteigen... Birkenau... Oświęcim... Dachau... - Aussteigen... - Calm down! - Birkenau... Oświęcim... - Quiet... - Dachau... - Hush, hush... Detrain... - Aussteigen! - - Franuś, calm down! - Aussteigen... - Quiet, quiet... Yes. It is a miracle that we did not go mad as he did. Thank you. That's enough. So many killed. So many crippled. The hell on Earth. Pruszków... Pruszków... Detrain... aussteigen... Thank you, madam. Mr. Antoni! Mrs. Halinka! You're alive! Yes, for now. We'll see... Our tenement house turned into a pile of debris. Yes. I saw it. I am the only survivor. Your mum was right to move to her relatives in Poznańska Street a week before. Is she here? Would you like some hot coffee? No. Thank you. You need it more than me. It's not for me. It's for the sick man. You know him. It's the musician who used to visit you. He's lying there. And you are here too! Don't get up. We did good out there, huh? I can't even dream about my violin. Each man has his own misfortunes. - Ten or more. - Thank you. I can't believe you didn't go into captivity! To the Germans? Voluntarily? I prefer the incertitude about the future. And Roman? How is he? He got to the other side of Vistula, to his men. That's good. Can you hear it? Their cannons are playing on Praga. Our cannons. Fire! Fire! And then, a wonderful return from Warsaw to Berlin. With a forbidden song on our lips. It was not forbidden anymore. The song is free, just as we are, just as Warsaw is. Well, guys? The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl Maybe your heart full of love Is at loss too Maybe you keep your love in secret? And you sob through the night? The song, the only song I sing it for you, my girl From beyond the mountains and rivers We got to the shore How far we are to The singing willows, lovely fields? Yesterday rag, Today a uniform Tighten your belt. It's time to go! Ahead our First Corps! From beyond the mountains to the West! THE END
