You don't have to say it like that This... May I have a moment? Hey black What do you want? The President has already said When the hearts of heroes are one The strength of the eight mark that is hidden will be released That is why we are all going to think of the same bird We will make one of the hearts And so we will fly!

Well, the implant has been done on purpose Implant? Lately they say that men with fangs like that are attractive But it suits me [Fang is like an eighth tooth. By kokonoe he means a ninth.] But you know? A little more and this fang goes up and does a kokonoe... Well then why are you all heroes ...? Listen to me For the money In this rotten city ... there is no good job Only the Hero Association is willing To hire people like us Quiet! Stop! Sorry. Sorry. Make way. Make way Where have they gone? Shit. Quiet! We got rid By the way, what happens here? [Saigo Takamori was born in Kagoshima and is considered the last samurai] Saigo-don! Respect!

Forms and fill them out, please Hey, if we make money and go to Tokyo City Do we no longer have to repay debts? Finally! In no time it's 25 Isn't it a shame to resign just before we get paid? I've left the kettle, griddle, and takoyaki pan on! Than? Let's go! Write this quickly ... [Everything refers to crying and tears] Me... I have no confidence in being able to put them all together Do not say that... So ... then you're no different from the bad guys [Refers to not being that type of person] Is not that. First of all, I am not that dish And a glass? Neither? Yokomine Makoto The truth is that ... when I was eight my father abandoned us I was a detective Suddenly, without saying anything, one day he did not return home ... They are sardines ... Dad ... Your father is not here! What do you eat! From then on I started to skip school and became addicted to gambling Now they chase me to return the money It's to cry! Abandoned, as in a painting, only death remains Since the day my father abandoned us, everything has been crazy A pendant without a chain! Is it related to any memory? Like old times...! I just want to know why he abandoned my mother and me But I haven't known anything for more than 20 years ... Me too 10 years ago! Has something happened to you too? Since I was 17 ... I never go out without this! A condom? It says "Good catch" Nasu's name too ... That's why I still don't know how to put it on! It is to cry ... Ok it's decided We are going to revolutionize the Eito Rangers! Let's go? Revolutionize? If we teach how we face obstacles as men We will no longer be the abandoned of the city. They will think the same, right? Bud season begins in the northern mountains shortly Hey? [It is one of the 100 most famous mountains in Japan] Yarigatake ... Muraoka! Be a man! Shh! Shorter [It is another of the 100 most famous mountains in Japan] Kurobegoroudake ... it's beautiful Haruka-chan ... do you like the color purple? The purple? Well I don't hate it ... And the eggplant? You like? The vegetable ... If I like it. The aubergine with mabo and ... the aubergine with mabo And like the aubergine with mabo! Really? You like aubergine! Yes, the aubergine with mabo What are you talking about? Haruka-chan, what do you think of heroes? The truth is that now there is a hero that I admire a lot Hey? If by any chance, that hero declared himself to you ... what would you do? Impossible. Impossible [Clink! = Brilliant onomatopoeia] It may not be impossible ... Clink! Not interested at all ... Captain Silver Hey? Can not be! He has not been able to pass the obstacles ... Why do you like Silver more than me? He is so handsome? Well, the rival is too strong Are we going to "Cry Cry" again? I'm asking you please, give me back Tsutomu Help! Someone help me! Help! Someone help me! Someone help me... Help! Help! Help! Do not face them Now we have no chance of winning But... Someone help me Someone help me Help! I have gathered you here with a single intention That you go to his lair I want you to rescue the children who have been kidnapped Impossible! Impossible! Impossible! How impossible! I've never seen heroes with such low motivation Well, we still don't know how to use the suits ... Hey? Not yet? There is no other remedy. I'll have to ask Captain Silver Come on, good work. Nice job Do you know This time the salary is 10,000 kan an hour ... it was too good What did you just say?... Hadn't he said it? If you learn to use the suits You will have a salary increase Ten thousand kan an hour? Okay. To train To train! Yes! At last you feel like it! The truth is that since the last time I have been thinking about several training plans ... Behold You are stupid? That makes no sense In most it says "hold on". How are we going to hold on? Oh! The first thing we should do It is asking someone who already knows how to use them to teach us, right? In that case, we can ask Captain Silver let him be our leader Hey? Good idea Wait wait. Isn't Yokomine our leader? Whoever is in the center has to have charisma Like silver or like me You got it? Yes! Like always, thank you Walk. Walk. Let's go. Thank you for your work! What do you think? I reject it Do not reveal my identity. Do not associate with anyone. That's my policy Regarding that, I couldn't do something ... Every time you ask the answer will be "no" Super blue ... super blue ... Wait a minute. I have an idea! Marunouchi What was your idea This [The truth of that moment. Conditions of a loser. What I wanted to bring to Cambodia] [Don't choose the means to the end. There is the possibility of somehow exploiting both the country and the people] I bring a package! Yes? Just a moment! What are you doing? I'm taking pictures of Silver's real face! Can not be. Have you followed me? Actually it is already its years ... So Silver's name ... Is it a matter of age? Silence! Come in everyone! Sutras? Sutras! A hawk! Pigeons! [The above exclamations end with "ya" but Nagoya already wears it] Nagoya? Thinking about diarrhea? So little... Is this where a legendary hero lives? Is this where a legendary hero lives?... [It's a poster for "Abunai Deka" (Dangerous Police) that aired between 1986 and 1987. Tachi Hiroshi was one of the main characters] This... Years ago they told me that it seemed a lot ... And what does that smell like? Before that. What are you doing ... How desperate ["Abudeka" is another reference to "Abunai Deka"] Black ants of the Incas "Abudeka" Listen to me! This is out ... What? What? A peeper! He does them with this camera ... Exciting Enough of nonsense! You can't tell anyone my identity. Do you understand? Ehhh ... what are we going to do? And ... in return you will become our leader? I refuse! Silver What if we broadcast this moving image? You... Great persuasive power What did you say to him? It's a secret The first thing is that you learn to listen to the heart of your ear Isn't that a rattle? The noise of the bell is the spirit of the voice of the one who has to be rescued You have to be focused at any time You have to get to catch that voice That's done! Nasu sees him completely as a rival Oh! There is! Take that! Ayyyy! I can not anymore. It is impossible A hero's first problem Is not being able to hear and detect this sound Can you? What happens? Whenever you want Oh! It's mine! Said you were a legendary hero but I'm not giving up Do you have something against me? Silver! You are just like them Don't put us in the same bag Terrorists no longer have things like the heart because they want to create a revolution quickly They have lost hope. They only move for money You are only heroes for the money. Where is the difference? Are you willing to fight these old men and also stop the brainwashing? Those who are not prepared to save people from the heart They have no right to call themselves heroes! Take them Let's go! It's been a bit overdone, hasn't it? It's true that we are heroes for money But that's because the country has abandoned us To this city and to us So it's not our fault That! It is the first time he says what he touches Is trying You've heard? Is that same Right now it doesn't matter what I tell you because you won't understand, right? What about the legendary hero? Even though he's a peeping Tom No way am I going to let him go with Haruka-chan! Okay Come to this. We just have to learn to use the suits ourselves Let's get the raise with the force of seven That! Although we said that There will be no way we will learn to use the suits We have reached our limit Is what we do okay? Make money easily. This is the smart way to live You're right With this ... to Tokyo City [Concert at the Tokyo Egg] [Transfer to the headquarters in Tokyo] [Home delivery in a luxury apartment] [Merchandising by Aoki Sayaka Ah! Last job? Have they resigned? What is this? The resignation letters? They haven't told us anything Even though they have been bothering us ... You and Silver ... now there are only four No problem Why...? Yokomine? Even though we promised that we would get the raise with the strength of all Well, they have already left it and there is no need to think about it any more. To something else! To begin with, from now on we will be the Three Friends No way! I can not You are crazy? You must stop human trafficking right now I've said it many times. Our job is ... Boss, like father Don't you want to stop the kidnapping of innocent children? Even if you say that Kitou-san. Am I wrong about something? Not If you have so much desire, do it, you two But by budget you cannot involve any other police Ale. Nice job Ah! Silver I can't believe you're asking me to drink What happens? You wanted to tell me something, right? Me... It seems that I am going to become suspicious Is it about the four of us now? Even though I don't want to go through the same thing again For the same? When I failed the exam at age six My mother said "It's the end". Always blamed me Me... Don't you love me anymore? But my father said "Even if you are abandoned by the country" "I will always protect you." I relax Even so... After saying that ... Abandoned us Your father is not here! Eat! You still hate your father, right? Is not my father. That kind But I've always kept his words in mind So when the President invited me saying "Will you become the one to protect this city?" I thought I would do what that guy didn't That's why I became a hero Well it was partly about the money I see Sorry. I'm saying weird things I have not caught anything It's the alcohol's fault So can I tell you how I made two hundred thousand kan in one day at pachinko? A lot of people think it's about going on opening day Although it often happens on event days too Well that day there was no event and still I was very lucky Early that day the lighting station was already free ... I sat there ... Ah! Boss! Look What happens? This... Eito ... Ran ... ger? What happens? Suddenly saying to patrol ... We will do what we can Why are you getting formal? This ... is changed I have drunk good alcohol I see Of course it's the alcohol ... What envy ... Behold! I will do it. Haruka, you take care of the driver Okay! Shh! Okay... Kitou-san, it's the ones from the Hero Association Tsk Just a moment! Red ... Black ... Purple. What have you come for? The small fish that do not come giving the air of a hero I can alone Go get him! Awesome Onore ... Hey? Ono ... Huh? Net? I can't ... the alcohol has worn off Spooky! Spooky. Spooky. Oh. Oh. Spooky It hurts, right? Can not. If the alcohol has run out, it's useless He is too scared. He hasn't had a drink and he can't stop shaking Eehhh? He has hurt you, right? Alcohol... Alcohol, right? Alcohol, right? We already know, calm down For them! Not! Watch out! Oh If you want to play heroes, do it in the afterlife Now it is OK! Kitou-san. Great Haruka-chan! Haruka, take them and run Agree! Elbow of steel! Here! You go first, Nasu Eggplant? Hey? Show us your face! Loose What are you doing! I said run away! Your bell has fallen They will see your face Run It hurt... You are strong Doing crazy things even when you are weak ... Sorry Are you going to drink? Still I have to thank you It is something very important, right? This bell is the one that made me a detective Are you a detective? When I was very little I lost my parents When I was five years old my father died of an illness When I was ten my mother died in Hachimansho jail The jail... One day suddenly my mother was accused of murder But my mother had a reliable alibi As she was telling the truth a detective helped her escape To escape? But if she was innocent, they sure believed her, right? The headquarters of the investigation did not allow it Why? For two years my mother and I, along with that detective, we live like fugitives Since I was only crying, that detective gave me this bell "If you have problems, make it ring" "Because I'll immediately go to where Momo-chan is" he said For me, who had lost my father when I was very little That detective was like my father But one day all of a sudden He left my mother and handed her over to the police My mother was arrested for murder and committed suicide in jail That's what the police said But... I'm sure my mother was innocent and even more certain that he was not a person who could commit suicide So in order to find out what really happened And find that detective, I became a detective I see How can people abandon other people so easily? Kitou-san. You're good? Who do you think you are talking to? You're right By the way, the heroes I fled with told me something The hero you were with, Black His father was a detective and it seems he disappeared twenty years ago Is it not related to the case you were investigating? I already told you that it was not your thing Let me help you, please. I do not have anything better to do You are investigating a rather old case ... Hey? This ... what are we going to do? You will be controllers of new products immediately This ... for starters, you, you and you. Agree? You and you Sit in those relaxation chairs and relax, please [The ku in Japanese is く] Put the waist in the place that looks like a ku. The one that looks like a ku, please So. Enjoy. Relax and enjoy Okay. Then it's your turn too so watch Okay This ... well ... this ... a lot of smoke Okay. Well ... first, raise both arms So. Close your eyes and think of an island in the Pacific ... Paradise ~ That. As you are, take a deep breath Queee seee Ah! Right now the rhythm wasn't ... Let ... be ... done ... The light! Okay. This ... you can open your eyes now So ... Will they pay us? What idiots ... Wha! What idiots are Mr. Dark ... I've caught quite a few, right? Without them knowing that we are the meeting point for recruitment Let us live, please! Agree Hey? Really? Bring Captain Silver and Black And the four of you will be released You have one hour If you don't bring them ... Light! You will finish ... So! Ale. You don't have much time left ... Nishikino. Hurry up! Hey? Ah. Me? Are you not thinking of escaping? Leave you like this and escape ... No way! Hears! Right now ... You have a hard time saying it! ["Corre Melos" is a literary work by Osamu Dazai that is widely read in schools in Japan. It has also been adapted several times to the screen] Is this "Corre Melos"? Black! Silver! Black! Silver! They're not here? Black! Silver! Black! Black! Silver! I love that bar Hey? Your... What are you doing here? Yokomine, you have to come with me. Others... Noooo! There is little left My ... my ... To all this, you. Did you think that you could be the only ones leaving town? What is that of the center? What is that charisma? Hears Your band stopped selling because you are unable to think of something other than yourself Do you think you can understand how I feel? The fans who said "We're going to follow you forever" when I was famous As soon as we stopped selling they said "Ah ... that boy is still alive" Hey. What are you looking at? They humiliated me Someday I'll take the stage of the Tokyo Egg And I'll show them what I am And that's why you betray us? Yokomine! Got it now Are you agree? You say that you are heroes and abandon your companions In the end it is only lip service You talk a lot but ... Can you save the whole world? I already saw it All the children who were taken to you who knows where in a truck ... Then i ask you Are you able to answer all of them at once? Of course it is impossible However, if I am able to save only one A person abandoned by society can continue to grow Therefore, even if I have abandoned everything under the suit I will try to save all possible people Can't you hear them? I can! They are the sounds of the bells that ask for help Me I thought those who commit the "It's me, it's me" scam were idiots But I have become a human being similar to them I have not understood anything you have said Sorry I have always hidden it but the truth is that ... I don't like blue. I like pink! What are you doing coming out of the closet right now? Blue is the color my wife liked Your wife? It's wrong for me to say it, but my wife was gorgeous He also had a daughter but ... They were killed by those guys Why are you stopping? Move! They're going to catch us! I always thought I was going to get revenge but ... I am sorry Sorry! I have hidden something too! I scammed Okawa with the "It's me, it's me" fraud Than? Ibusuki's uncle, it's me Also in Kagoshima-ben? What are you doing? Give Okawa his money back! Now it is OK I've had enough and I'm tired Do people have fun fooling me? Time is running out! Shit Shit Run away Don't run away Run away Don't run away Run away Run away Don't run away Run away Run away Don't run away This is not contrary to my policy of not partnering with anyone Silver already said "Those who are not prepared to save people from the heart" "They have no right to call themselves heroes!" I wonder if they are ringing bells We may not have done anything to listen to them If they are still bells that we cannot hear We will abandon them again Did you just hear that? No. I haven't heard ... Shh Is the sound of their bells Let us go fast Shit. We are going to burn Smells like burned hair Sakurajima! Ah! Silver - The lever!- Have to lower the lever. [Palanca in English is "lever". Liver is "liver". How they use the English term, it gets confused] The liver? Not! Not! That's the liver! The liver! The lever! The lever! That lever. That one! We already thought you would not come! So that I can shine in the center Fireworks like you are needed What are you saying? It's not what we had agreed Where is Black? Mr. Dark. With this it should be worth it Do you have a martyr complex? What can you do alone? Protect the bells Do not say foolishness There is! Black ants of the Incas "Abudeka"! Go! Awesome It moves so fast that you can't even see Silver! There! Over there! Hey? Now! Lock him up These four are worth nothing. Get rid of them - Hey!- Okay! Flees! Run away! Sorry. Sorry! Oh! That hurts Stop the laser! Quiet! You have come This is the power of suits? Just a moment. Just a moment. Just a moment. Shit. Shit. Shit Oh... If I hit you in the belly it hurts, right? Nasu! Nasu!... Quick. hurry up... - For them?- For them For them For them... What a show! This was the last I have not come to save you I only came because I heard the bells Is shy You're wrong Wanted to finish Me... I leave the Eito Ranger Why? I have not been able to protect a child Even when he rang the bell and asked for help That's why I have no right to remain a hero What are you saying? That couldn't be helped That is no excuse! He was so small ... Just like I thought, I can't be as strong as Silver Although it has fallen with a can If I think about what could happen again ... If I think about it... I'm scared I can't help but be afraid! This is too much for me. I can not anymore This guy has been out of control too long ... The time has come when I have to finally solve it It is a difficult decision I thank you Thanks to you I was able to fulfill my dream I no longer have any regrets Fate is one of my favorite things Sardines Yokomine's father ... Yes, and they have not seen each other for more than twenty years Ay, ay, ay, ay After you betrayed us, he got quite depressed Oh! Can not be What's up, Yasuhara? Hey. Where are you going? What happens? What up You're right, the one who was guarding the jail twenty years ago was me Why wasn't the suspect prevented from committing suicide? What's up, Nishina? Talking about a case from so many years ago I've been asking everyone at the police station and I've been investigating him After this incident you received special treatment for your promotion, right? That is evaluated by the actions of each day Still the suspect who had to watch died It is not weird? What are you accusing me of? Can you hear only one thing? Tell me This just got to us Give us Captain Silver We have taken the Hachimansho police station I have placed a petrochemical pump in the center of the city If it explodes, the whole city will be turned to ashes If they want to save the lives of citizens Let him come to Hachimansho alone Why Silver? His only goal is to get revenge on Silver Get revenge? Actually Silver and I are former cops Although it's been more than twenty years since We were investigating a false accusation case An innocent woman I was going to be arrested on false murder charges When he realized it, Silver decided to protect that woman and her daughter and they were on the run for two years This story ... where have I heard it? Haven't you heard it from Kitou? Wait a moment That means that the one who abandoned Kitou's mother And he handed her over to the police was ... Silver? That's a misunderstanding While Silver fled, I continued the investigation alone I discovered that the son of the then Director General of the National Police Agency Higashiura Kazuyuki, was the real killer But surprisingly Higashiura sincerely repented himself So Silver, to prove his alibi Took Kitou's mother to the police But to protect themselves They released Higashiura's son again Instead, Kitou's mother was charged My mother was not told she was going to be guilty of murder Were you the one who killed her? Cared for 18 years by relatives The flames of hatred remain constant in me Can not be. You are... So, the identity of Mr. Dark ... Why? It's my crusade You have five seconds Try to confess to save your life 5! I had no choice but to kill her and pretend it was suicide 4! The boss threatened to fire me if I didn't! 3! At that time my wife was pregnant with my daughter It was not my fault... You were on the 3rd ... I have said a confession. A confession Who told you to make excuses? This garbage! Why are you doing this? The show has just begun I'm going to show you the unknown of this corrupt justice! There is no longer true justice in the police That's why we quit We started this Association of Heroes Thereafter, Silver gave up all of his previous life He vowed to be a hero for life without ever revealing his identity Still he always had a dream Drinking sake side by side with the son she hadn't seen in years That's why I looked for you and made you meet Silver Hey? He's not my father. That guy Can not be... Silver is Yokomine Masayoshi Your father So as not to get involved or make things difficult for you He gave up his name too And now giving up his life He wants to make it up to Kitou The only one who can stop him is Black No, Makoto. Nobody but you Sorry But I... That your father abandoned you I don't know if you've always thought that but you're wrong watch this I was at Silver's house What is this? Watch him play! The same person appears in all the photos Look this kid Yasuhara realized just seeing this Don't you love me anymore? Even if you are abandoned by the country Dad will always protect you Although he wanted to get closer he did not This way I could protect you even if I was far away Come on. Let's all go together where Silver is Let's go Get everyone involved ... [It literally says "Don't say things that smell like water", without much meaning in Spanish] Don't say bullshit!
