And then there's Spermball, he's, his real name is Milton Velasquez but nobody calls him that, they call him Spermball 'cause he gets that name, my brother gave him that name, and he tell everybody that name, 'cause we met him before anybody did. So then, so then we, so then I really guess he likes jacking off 'cause he like 'cause he, eh, eh, every time he takes a shower he jacks off and he shows us how his mom and dad fuck. And then, and then, he just started laughing and then he cusses in Spanish and it's funny, then. And then Robert's brother is Porky, he's 16, too, and then he's, he's like a porn addict and supposedly, like, since Porky liked a girl, but she liked some other guy. Porky got mad. And then he was trying to commit suicide by drowning himself on the sink but then, but then when he went, he ran out of breath, he just like went like, like, put his head out the sink and then then got more breath and then he went back in. And then, to believe he was committing suicide and then we opened the door and then he got mad and then, and then supposedly he was gonna choke himself to death and then he was walking around weird with a belt choking himself and then, then he weird and, and then he he started eating with the belt on his neck to believe he was committing suicide. Then, that's why. And then 'cause that's all 'cause 'cause the police, I'm going like 'cause the girl he liked some other guy named Frank, and then, and then he was trying to kick his ass. Then he couldn't. And there was that one time... What other story do you want me to tell you? Jonathan. A la escuela. Jonathan. A la escuela. A la escuela. Hi, mom. Milton. I feel sick.

Come on, Jonathan, we gotta go! Let's go, come on! We got a gig at Gina's party Saturday night. Tomorrow? We're gonna practice tonight at my house. Can you come over? I don't know if I can tonight. Maybe I can stop by after I go to my house, for just a little bit. Come over at 4:30. Okay. Here comes Rosalia. Hey, Jonathan. I gotta go skating. I think that Jonathan is real hot. Yeah, but he already got a girlfriend. Have you got a girlfriend? No. Did you hit that? No, I wanted her to. You didn't fuck her? No. Why not? I didn't want to take off my pants. Man, you're stupid. The first time I did it, I was sure fucked up. My girlfriend, you know the one I had in 6th grade? Yeah. Well, her. She... She invited me over to her house after school. So I went to her house. We weren't planning to do it. And then it just popped up and then I took off my shirt first and she said, then I told her you take off your shirt. She had two shirts and I had to take off my pants then she'd take off her other shirt then I started taking off my watch and she'll take off her bra then I'll take off one of my socks and she'll take off her pants until we were in underwear and I took off mines and she took off hers at the same time. And then, I got on top of her and then I tried putting it in like for half an hour I could not find the hole. I kept putting it too low, too high, and then I found the hole and I pushed it in hard and then she started crying but then I end up finding out you gotta get the girl wet before you do it with them. My brother told me. And then I heard her sister talking I thought she was coming into the room. So then I run behind the door and hide naked and then she kept looking at me so then I was super embarrassed and then I locked the door and then jumped in her bed and got under the covers and then we started doing it again and then I heard the gate open and then I told her did you hear that she said yeah. And then, she said it's my dad so then as soon as I heard that, I ran the shit out of me. And then I hopped the gate into the neighbor's house and I just walked out and I think her dad saw me. And then I went home and I was about to call her but then I got embarrassed and then I didn't go to school for two weeks because of that. Then I finally went to school I saw her, the only thing I said was hi. , Sperm. Milton, fool. Milton? I don't want to be called Spermball no more. My name is Milton. All right, Spermball. Hey, where's Jonathan going? He had something to do. You all right? Yeah. That's nasty. Yeah, I was spinning fast. Yechh. Faster! Faster! Faster! Caught you! They're like a greyhound when you put 'em like this. Let's try to make him look like a greyhound dog. See? Look! He got little wings! Make 'em flap. That's it, gimme my dog, man. You're gonna kill him like that. He's skinny. He's been gang banging too much. Cindy, go in mom's room and watch it. Ben Johnson? Shut up. Make a move and groove. So why you like that to your sister? Always kicking her ass out. Yeah. Hey, where'd you get that? Spermball. That's not my name no more. What is your name? Milton. Girls aren't going to fuck a guy named Spermball. And you think they'll fuck a guy named Milton? Maybe they will. I just don't want to be called Spermball. Why do they call you Spermball? I named him 'cause one day I was walking from school, and I don't know where he just came, he just jumped up from behind the trash can and he got Hey kid, what's your name? I didn't pay attention and then I saw sperm on his hand. And he was like 11, and anyways he was all young and white, and because he had a that day, I had a fro. Was his sperm red? Yeah, all red! So, I didn't know his name so from that day on we called him Spermball. I asked him to call me milkshake. Then Spermball stayed and that's why. Jonathan, I have to go, my mother will be home. All right. Okay. So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Yow! I'm meeting your father so take care of Cindy. Okay. Bye. It's mine. Let's see what else he has. Wassup haters! What's up with that? Wassup with Wassup Haters? Who the fuck is knocking? I heard the music outside. All the way over there. I was walking by. You got beer. I like beer. Makes me crazy. I don't mess with girls. Yeah. Hello, Jonathan, wanna go do something? Nah, I'm cool. I was thinking we could go to the room. What makes you think you could get some? Everyone else had some. Yeah, we did. I remember when me and Rosalia did it for our first time. Man, I was a virgin and she knew she took advantage of that. I felt used. How many dudes do you think Rosalia fucked? 15, 20, she only 14. Yeah, I remember the time she wanted to hit and I told her no 'cause I don't want to fuck 18 guys. Man, my life is shit. I remember one day, I went to my brother's best friend's house, There was this girl, I think she liked me, her name was Gina. I was drunk, so I fell asleep in the bathroom. She took off her pants, I woke up and we were having sex. And I had no condom. Then people started telling me you got her pregnant so I cried on some girl's shoulder. Gina told her she didn't want me to do nothing with the baby. It wasn't my problem. Fuck it. You really think I got that bitch pregnant? If you fucked her, yeah. Man, that's luck. My life is shit. She likes nasty sex, doesn't she? She knows a lot. I don't like that. Man, I wish I had her right now, that slut. Man, Porky, quit that shit 'cause every time you get drunk you start crying and we gotta listen to it. Fuck it, then, I'll go somewhere you don't have to hear me cry. Would you be mad if I asked you if you're a virgin? No. Oh! Now you got caught! Jonathan! Jonathan, you a hater! He ain't never gonna do it like that. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck is wrong with you, boy? You're fucking stupid, man. I got Danny's car. He let me borrow the car. Is the trunk open? Come on, you're stupid, close my door, nigga, close my door, nigga.

I don't really want to kill anybody. Yeah. We win the fights, but they never beat us up or shit. You ever fight? No, not here. Nothing to fight about here. Well, actually, there is but, people don't really take it to that. 'Cause right down, we fight with them, some, calm down 'cause you beat 'em up and stuff, but some wanna keep on going, they wanna at least try to beat you up once. What if they can't the first time? Then they'll keep on trying but some will stop. They will learn the lesson that they can't beat you up and stuff. Yeah. That's the way it is over there. Yeah. 'Cause my friend got killed like two days ago. By my home, like a block away. He got killed? How? They shot him. They shot him? You saw it? No. Were you like sad? Yeah, 'cause he was cool.

Was it somebody you knew? Got shot? Who? Some guy. Were you sad? I don't know. Is everybody like that there? Just except for you guys? It's complicated around there. Why? 'Cause they always try to cause you problems. And then they try to bring their family up or something. And then, when you bring the family, people always say that we start stuff 'cause we're troublemakers, shit, and they're the ones that are startin'. You know how the moms are, they always believe their child and stuff. That's how it is. Geez. Oh! Yeah-oh! Ooh! You can take off your pants if you want. What the fuck?! Oh shit! Leave him alone!
