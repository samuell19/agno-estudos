Stop! Out of the way! Stop! Kidai Sha, now you die! AKAUSHI SAI, BUGEN-RYU KOREAN KUNG FU You fucker! Come on. Go get her! Right... Let's go! Out of here! Are you alright? Are you alright? You have to tell Professor Enmei Oh... Enmei Oh? What is this film? This is the Osone mansion. Many martial artists are gathered there. That's Birei! My daughter has been handed over to a group of kidnappers. Birei... Didn't the two of you go to high school together? Yes, we were good friends. Koryu, the man who was killed was a detective in the Hong Kong Police Department by the name of Kidai Sha. This film is evidence that he collected. I see. Please look at this. Koryu, you're a strong fighter. I want you to rescue Birei. I understand. I'll do what I can. Thank you. My sister lives in Tokyo. I'm sure she'll help me out. Good. This airplane ticket for Asian Flight 107 was found in Detective Sha's pocket. It's a ticket to Haneda Airport. INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS Welcome back, brother. Welcome back. How was your trip? Birei! Follow that car! What are you doing? Follow that car! Hey, what's going on? Where are you going? KO BYAKU, CHINESE KUNG-FU Where do you think you're going? CHOZABURO HONIDEN, BUGO-RYU KARATE Stop! OSONE ENTERPRISES These are some real jewels. Take them to the basement and keep an eye on them until the operations. Move it. You heard him, get going! Move it! We've got 500 carats of uncut stones here. It's a real pain in the ass to deal with these blood diamonds. What's with the looks on your faces? You took care of our little female problem? Well, she... - She got away. - You fucking idiot! You let her get away? What do we do if she figures out the organization's secrets? Chozaburo! There's a lot of talk about how strong you three Honiden brothers are, but I'm not seeing it! If the boss finds out, don't think you'll get off easy! Hunt her down, even if you have to look under every rock. What would your brother say if he heard about this? Who the hell are you? I'm looking for a job. I heard the boss here has a hobby of collecting martial artists. We aren't looking for any thugs-for-hire like yourself. Get the hell out of here! Enough! From what I can see, you're nothing but useless punks. You hire me, and this organization will be stronger. You've got balls coming here and selling yourself like this. So what's your specialty? I see... We'll have to talk over the terms of your employment. Nice skills. The boss'll be happy. I don't come cheap. Welcome... Koryu! - Sister! - Koryu! Why all the secrecy? You should've told me you were coming to Tokyo. I'm sorry. Still the same old Koryu. This is a really nice store. Sister, how's your work as a jewelry designer going? Yes... it's going just fine. This is the owner, Mr. Kohinata. - This is my sister, Koryu. - Nice to meet you. Ah, what a pretty girl! I'd be glad to arrange some sightseeing if you want. I'm actually here because my friend Birei was kidnapped. Right... I'm on the trail of the group that did it. It's too dangerous! You shouldn't poke your nose into that kind of business! I'll be fine. I'm going to find Birei, no matter what. Sister, what's wrong? Koryu... I'm sorry but I'll be on vacation for a few days and won't be at home. You can wait for me in my apartment. That's alright, isn't it? BYAKURAN LEE Come on in. Don't be shy, make yourself at home. It's so tidy. Byakuran always keeps her room so nice. Smells nice, too. Mind if I have a look? Ah, so pretty. Pretty... That's cold! Susumu, you little...! Damned boy, always fooling around! Get over here. He's been getting into all sorts of mischief, so we've sent him to the Shorinji Kempo school for training. - Oh, Shorinji! - That's right. You should come training sometime, Miss. Sure! I don't have a card, but I'll give you this. - Why, thank you. - Good boy. That's the Shorinji Kempo body slam! What's gotten into you? She's a lady. But the master always tells us never to leave ourselves open to attack. She's not gonna attack you. Apologize to the nice lady. Don't "hmpf" at me! I didn't raise you to act like that. Apologize! - See ya! - Huh? Wait, Susumu! SHIKAJIRO HONIDEN, TAINAN SHORT SPEAR FIGHTING I'm gonna get revenge for what you did to my brother, bitch! Hang in there, nice lady! Fight! What's going on? It's getting a little crowded here! He's run away! OSONE Don't fight it. So how about it? Give up the jewelry business and become my secretary. I'll treat you right. What's wrong? Are you so worried about that sister of yours? Koryu's my responsibility. I'll send her back to Hong Kong. I hear she's a pretty tough fighter. Maybe if she wants the job, I could hire her as my bodyguard. Of course, it's probably too late. What? You screwed it up? You fucking idiot! She's already taken down too many people in this organization! It's just one girl! Now shut the fuck up and stop letting her get in your way! You broke your promise to me. Even though I begged you last night! Shut up! You caught me in your trap and turned me into your whore, and on top of all that you want to kill my only sister? Byakuran, who do you think you are, talking that way to your master? Maybe we should show your sister what you really are. I've already got plenty of photos of you in compromising situations. How about we show them to your sister? Mayumi, is this making you jealous? Every time she spends the night with him... "... become my secretary and I'll treat you right... " I don't think so. I'm only interested in the diamonds. It sounds like a tale full of sin. A young girl travels to far-off Japan to become a jewelry designer, just to end up with you filming her while she has sex. That's how the Yakuza work, too. Doctor, one of our "carrier pigeons" arrived from Hong Kong today for an operation. Lay off the drinking till you're done. Nah, the operation will go better if I drink. Did you solve the Koryu problem? They messed up again. What, with all the information I provided? Byakuran knows her sister is taking on the organization, and it's got her unsettled. Listen, Mr. Kuroki, maybe you should take care of them both? What? What would the boss have to say about that? Just where is he supposed to find another gem cutter who's as skilled as her? Plus, it seems that the boss is crazy about her. Koryu! On the path to true strength, you must always trust in yourself. Through the harsh training that unifies every part of your body, you must look deeply into yourself, confront your own weaknesses, and in doing so, master true power. And stop! At ease! Next, the Giwaken technique! Koryu! Koryu, anyone who could injure you must truly be skilled. Master, do you know who he might have been? Father... Perhaps it was Shikajiro Honiden. He wields that sort of spear. Shikajiro Honiden? The second of the three Honiden brothers. They give Japan's martial arts a bad name. The eldest, Inoichiro, is the founder of Tenma-ryu Kempo, and the youngest, Chozaburo, is a master of Bugo-ryu Karate. I've heard they'll commit any vicious act necessary to carry out their orders. Koryu, we can't let this stigma remain on Japan's martial arts. We followers of Shorinji Kempo offer all our strength to help you. All our strength. Thank you. KING HESSIUS, MONGOLIAN TENKU SWORD SINCERITY INOICHIRO HONIDEN, TENMA-RYU KEMPO I see you're both taking your time with the lady dragon from Hong Kong. - She'll die next time for sure! - I'm paying you well to get this done. Take the job seriously. Stop! You idiot! What the hell are you thinking, facing off against the boss? Try that again and I'll kill you myself! Boss, this is the guy who's offered himself for hire. Boss, this won't happen with me. I'm certainly more useful to you than these dime-a-dozen thugs. Hey, sonny... ...who are you calling "dime-a-dozen"? Enough! What do you call yourself? Shunsuke Tsubaki. Tsubaki, as in the song, Tsubaki is the Flower of Love. What's wrong, Byakuran? Oh, nothing. You're OK from here. I'll take the diamonds to the mansion for safekeeping. The next step is up to you. You know what to do, right? Yes. - Doctor, are you alright? - Shut up. Leave it to me. Birei... You, hand me that syringe. Next one! Be quiet! - Koryu! - Birei. Get her! Birei! It's me, Koryu, from Hong Kong! Don't let her get away! Birei, quickly! Stop her! Stop her! We get infiltrated by the lady dragon who steals one of my Hong Kong girls. What the hell were you doing? Get rid of both of them now! Understood. I'll strangle the bitches with my own hands. Silence! You and your brothers have already failed me twice! I won't tolerate another mistake! Who the hell's that? He'll be useful to us soon enough. What's he supposed to be? I've been waiting for the chance to use him. He's a secret warrior who trained deep in the mountains. My brothers and I will take care of Koryu and Birei... ...in one fell swoop. Hello? Oh, Sister! Our lives are in danger? How did you find that out? The ones planning to kill you are the head of Osone Enterprises, Kazunari Osone, and the three Honiden brothers. Koryu, be careful. Where are you, sister? - Sister! - So, Koryu... Sister! Sister! Byakuran, you betrayed us. Sister! Sister... Byakuran, you should know better than anyone how harshly I deal with traitors. Careful. Move and that noose will close around your neck. Alright, enough. What amazing sisterly love. I'll be sure to send Koryu to the afterworld in a manner even more cruel. You kill innocent people like they're insects. - It's inhuman! - Say what you want! Think how it would sadden Koryu, how she would cry, if she knew that you belonged to our organization. You animal! Byakuran, take a good look. My face is the last thing you'll ever see. Byakuran managed to escape from the Osone mansion. She desperately wants to see you. So where is she now? She's at the racecourse. - The racecourse? - That's right. Sister? NIJINOSUKE MAYUZUMI, JIGENSHIN-RYU SWORDSMANSHIP Byakuran, look here! Your sister has arrived! Sister... Koryu! It seems the day I send you to Hell has finally arrived. Koryu, run! Go back to Hong Kong with Birei! Where do you think you're going? Sister! What happened to your eyes? Byakuran has had both her eyes put out, and now she wanders in a hell of darkness. She betrayed our organization, you see. Your beloved sister is my woman. She's nothing more than a filthy whore working for our organization. She was even betraying you all along. - Koryu! - Sister! Bitch! Now I shall take your life. Cheer up, Birei. You'll be able to go back to your father in Hong Kong soon. What about Koryu? Where is she? Koryu went to see Byakuran. No! She mustn't go! Why not? Byakuran... ...is in with those criminals. Byakuran is? But I feel so sorry for her. When she saw how they were hiding the jewels in our bodies and then bringing us to Japan... ...she wept. Jewels? Then they made us work as prostitutes at the Oriental. They did that? Who did all that to you? Osone Enterprises... Birei! Birei! Don't move! Koryu! Birei is... Birei... We're the three Honiden brothers. We've come for Koryu Lee! Bring her out! Go wait by Birei's body. Bring out Koryu! I'm gonna beat her to death! Shame on you! You think you're a man of the martial arts? What the fuck are you preaching here, with your two-bit Hong Kong karate? Hand her over! Damn you. Remember this! Mine will be the hands that send Koryu Lee to Hell! And someday, we three brothers will return to set this school straight! Don't forget that! Headmaster... No need to worry, Koryu. But the trouble I've caused you... I doubt we'll see them around here again. If we let Inoichiro be, he's certain to try some sort of vicious trick. Let me deal with him. Koryu, let the Shorinji School handle this. We can't lose the fight against him. The last time I faced him, I was roundly defeated. I must beat him. Don't move! The more you move, the more your enemy moves. Don't be distracted by the sound. Look him straight in the eye. Just like that! But never overlook those kinds of attacks. Why are you helping me? They've taken Byakuran to the basement of the Oriental. Koryu. You little bitch. You've walked right into our trap. You're clueless, you and your sister both! Leave her alone. You want a fight, I'll be happy to give you one. What was that, you bastard? I suppose you bastards have heard of Kidai Sha the detective from Hong Kong? Kidai Sha? Kidai Sha was my brother. And you're the ones who killed him. I'm here for my revenge. Come on! Bastard... You betraying son of a bitch. Get him! Koryu, don't worry about me. Get to the basement and save your sister. Sister. Sister! Koryu. Koryu! Sister! Sister! Koryu. Koryu. Sister! Sister. Sister. Koryu. Forgive me. Oh, sister... I was so weak this whole time. And I involved you in this. Sister! Koryu... I cut this diamond specially for you. Please accept it. Koryu... You're going to be all alone from now on. Be strong always. Always... Sister! Koryu. Sister! You bitch! Die! Koryu! That took a lot of guts to break into my mansion all by yourself. The perfect time to pluck out the eyes of the two people who have crossed our organization. Tsubaki... Kill them! Kill them both! You bitch! You've drawn your last breath. Koryu, go after the boss. Quickly! Inoichiro, leave him to us. Go after Koryu! Right. Koryu, I'm going to send you to Hell. Chozaburo, don't give up now! Get up! Get up! Kill her now! That's the sound I must ignore. Now's my chance! I think this is yours. Sister. My sister. Sister! THE END
