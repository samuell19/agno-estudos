Production Group "KADR" Presents INNOCENT SORCERERS Screenplay Co-starring Photograph)' Editors Design Music Director Innocent Sorcerers You can start now. - Kiss me... - You wanted to make a recording. - And now I want you to kiss me. - On a whim? Just kiss me. Do you like my stones? I like your honesty, You never even try to hide how lazy you are. Silly boy, that's just a whim, too! Just imagine... - Kiss me... - You wanted to make a recording. - And now I want you to kiss me. - On a whim? Just kiss me. Do you like my stones? I like your honesty. You never even try to hide how lazy you are. Silly boy, that's just a whim, too! Just imagine... I'm at home. Or out, walking. And I want you... I'm not an object. Of course not. An object can be bought. I have to throw a stone to get you. Or I could clap my hands if you prefer clapping... - What do you want? - Hi! Come down! On my Way! - Hi! - Ciao! - What? - I saw Mirka. She's very sad. What's up? Listen, man. I have my test today. Can you fill in for me at Gwardia? - I need to be free by 8:00pm. - You will be. - You... - It's my driving test today. - My instructor's going on holiday. - Hello, sir! - How are you? - I'm OK. Never getting any richer. Ciao! Calm down. Your teacher has never seen such a terrible driver. How many people have you run over today? Out of the way! - Are you coming to 'Mannequin'? - Maybe. - Try and come. - Edek, be careful. All right. Bye! Excuse me! - Who was hurt? - Pietrzak, of course. Hello. Great! Do the same this evening and you'll win. Boys, check-up time. Teresa! Long time, no see! - I saw you with a pretty girl. - Where? - In the club. - You were there? Your band was good. Your new love, I presume? - Who, the band? - The girl. - Love... - You still don't like the word? - As you know, I never use it. - Because...? Sorry. You're a nice person, but I don't feel like confessing to you. I knew you'd say that. Why ask, then? How many stones need to be thrown these days? - Three. - So many? - One was enough in the old days. - Time stands still for no man. Let's start, doctor. We've got the scales. Bogdariski... I read you won yesterday. Is it the semi-finals today? It's gonna be tough. The other guy's a southpaw. Give him a lef tjab, instead of keeping your guard up. - Easier said than done. - He's scared sick. Stop talking! He's healthy! He's gonna win. - I've got your picture. - Next! - The one we took in the mountains? - No. Some other one. Wait! Hamleciak... - Wait. Stop! - I've got a strong heart, right? It will get you to the Olympics. What's that? - Just a small injury. - It needs to be stitched up. - He's fighting today. - You know the regulations. It's an open wound. It needs a stitch. No fights for two weeks. Write the papers up. - He's the favourite! - Forget it. Prepare a referral. My girlfriend came to see the fight. You want her to see you bleeding? - The guy's a loser! - And you'll lose against a loser. One blow and you'll have blood in your eyes. Get dressed! Next! - Coach, the championship is mine. - Stop talking. Next! Take your papers and go! Yes? Just a moment. It's for you. - Who's calling? - The girl. Hello, Mirka? Dudek! I'll be there in 20 minutes. Wait, wait... I'm already out the door. Later. Bye! - Is this any place to stand? - Are you sick? - Blocking the passage... - Keep it down, fellas! - I'm here. - I was so nervous I got sick. - What was it? - We need to talk. - Stop it! We're playing now. - Not now. He's nervous. - Me? - No, him. - Can't sleep at nights. - Me, nervous? Smile. Don't make the others nervous. - We're finished. Nerves. - You are making me nervous. - Trumpet: Andrzej Sosnowski. - Gd. Gd.! - Maybe I shouldn't have come? - True. You've got a nerve! Let me do it. Double bass: the band leader, Polo! My bass! Give it to me! My bass! - Were you home? - Of course I was. Drums: Medicine Man. Shit! It was shit! It was fairground music. - We're finished. - But I think we'll win anyway. - My coat... - Answer me first. Give me my coat. - You've only been playing for three years? - Yes. But a lot. And whatever I do, I do precisely. - You mean well? - Precisely. - Why did you start playing jazz music? - I like music. Pawel! Come on! - Classical music too? - Of course. - But you are a medical student. - I'm a doctor. I'm a sports doctor. I work at the GKKF club. - Pawel! Come on! - Is sport your hobby? - I don't have a hobby. - How about jazz? Jazz is my hobby. With a capital 'H'. One more question. What are your plans for the future? I want to meet you. For coffee. And plans for later? I'm going to Rome, for the Olympics. Thank you very much. It's best to call before 10:00am. See you. Come on, for God's sake! The night on the river Was so very pretty I saw our shadows Me close to you When you were smoking In the evening light The smoke never vanished And it was so blue And when you looked at me It was so full of meaning You enchanted my eyes You enchanted my heart Your sorcery Enchanted my world We were not dreaming Not even at night We were not talking Not even a sigh Just holding hands For long hours We were not crying We weren't sad We weren't unhappy Nothing like that Every night seems beautiful To me since then So many memories I have - Did you fail your test? - I passed. - What are you drinking? - Nothing. I'm driving. Look! What a nice chick! She could drive a man wild. You think every girl is nice. Where? Second table, on the right. - Which one? - Are you blind? Over there! - So, let's finish the wine. - No. We're leaving. Well? - Am I wrong? - You want a lemonade? You loser! She's great and we can have her. Dance with her! - Want a drink? - Why not. Two vodkas please! Nothing? Nothing. Why did I come here? I'm wasting time. Help me! - Me? I'm not a miracle worker. - If you only tried... Look, she's leaving. We can try the taxi stunt. They'll be going dancing somewhere. He's taking his briefcase and leaving. - Is your coat in the cloakroom? - No. Grab the girl. I'll be back in five. - And if they decide to walk? - Try and charm her. Come back here. Hurry! They're leaving. You'll get killed one of these days if you're not careful. Thank you... Goodnight... Are you free? I'll get in first. I'm not alone. Please stop! Where is this from? A gift from America? - It's from Paris. - Did you buy it in Paris? No, on Nowy Swiat Street for 3,000 zloty. - That's a lot. - Let's go! - Where are you going? - You said let's go! - I thought we'd go back inside. - Sorry. Your order was not obvious. - I have to listen to my kidnapper. - Let's talk about it inside. Are you trying to resist? Have pity on my parents. They are crying now. - Where are they crying? - Far from here. So you come from far away. My aunt in the suburbs is crying, too. - Too many tears, perhaps? - How many tears am I worth? One. One tear from a man. Is that a lot? Or not? Look. One tear from a man, half a zloty. I'm buying. Goodnight. - You've overpaid. - As you did for your coat. - Are you waiting for something? - For you, all my life. Show me your hand. The left one. Just as I thought. A really brilliant mind. Faithful, stable in his feelings. A long life. - Are you happy? - Yes. - Can I catch a taxi on the square? - Probably. Now's the time to offer me a place to spend the night. Don't disappoint the silly little girl. - Don't be stupid. - You wanted to pick up a chick. You bore me. Where are the taxis? - You live in the suburbs? - I'm going to be late. - When does your train leave? - At 1:10am. Taxi! - The railway station! - I'm going the other way. What do you mean...? - Can't even catch a stupid taxi. - Sad, but true. Just after payday... ...it's harder to catch a taxi here than a girl. Think you're witty? - Of course. - A taxi would be better. For you, I'll do anything. I'll even catch a bus. - Thank you for a wonderful evening. - Thank you for letting me go. Two tickets. What? It's 1:08. Do you have a ticket? - Platform ticket, please. - 1.20 zloty. - Here you go. - Thank you. Let's go. Who's in a hurry here? You or me? Oh, Youth, give me thy wings. Murder me! Kill me! Finish me off... Shoot me! Murder me. - Are you tired? - Of what? Silence? - I've never been here before. - How often do you visit Warsaw? - What do you mean by "often"? - Once a week, once a month... - Not even once a year. - I see. This way. - Which floor? - First floor. - I bet you walk in the mountains a lot. - Careful... You'll burn yourself. It's a pity we're not in the mountains. [We could climb Swinica Mountain. Never again! I went there once. And I found out my friend was a moron. - When did you realise that? - Sadly, on the way back. I hate that stupid mountain. - And the Ko√©cielec Mountain? - A much better idea. - That guy was not a moron? - I went there alone. - That's one way to do it. - To do what? To avoid disappointments. You think it's a good way? I think you should take your coat off. You have a small pimple. On your left cheek. - Impossible. - Don't squeeze it too early. Don't touch it. Use rubbing alcohol and be careful when shaving. Miss... Nice bedspread... - Folk art. - Something like that. You're sentimental. Hopelessly sentimental. - Well... - Well what? So... So... Now that you know my true nature... ...let's get sentimental. You don't know how lonely I feel. Everybody is lonely. You're lonely too, aren't you? I have my ambitions. I hope so. I don't know if I can be your equal. You...? When a game is just a game it's no fun. One of my friends says all chicks are the same. Stupid. Some of them are pretty and some are not. But I don't think he's met you. - You've won this time. - I won twice. - One compliment costs me this much? - Don't overdo it. I won again. If a fish takes the bait too fast... - I'm looking for revenge. - You're allowed to. - Let's make a deal. - Great! - What's the first clause? - Boy meets girl. - Circumstances? - Rather trivial. - She misses her last train. - His scooter is broken. - And things... - And things are getting serious. So... Clause 1... A shot of vodka... ...and... ...names are exchanged. - The first kiss. - One kiss? There's only one first kiss. It can be repeated. Just write: "kissing". Give us a margin of freedom. - A margin of what? - Of freedom. Of delusion. And then... Bright conversation. Soul enriching. Right. Before lying down we need to discuss the dilemmas of our time. Really? And what's next? It's time to go to bed if you don't mind. Sofa bed. All amendments are admissible. And a great margin of freedom. Really? And what's next? What's the last paragraph? Well? What's next? A question mark. That doesn't suit our agreement. - Do you want a drink? - Of course. ...a song from the film "Innocent Sorcerers. So... Let us repeat. - Clause 1. - A glass of vodka, exchanging names. - And then? - The first kiss. - And then? - Some bright conversation. - And then? - Go to bed. To the sofa bed. Of course. Which one? I'm Pelagia. Bazyli. Clause 1 - check. Right? Your lips are beautiful. Just my lips? I'm a slave to our agreement. For now, I can talk only of lips. If I was planning a rebellion I would say that... ...your legs are nice... Your skin is pretty. Here, in the shadow of your tempting neck. And if I was impatient I would even be brave enough to say something more revealing. With my rebellious mind I could even fantasise... ...about all the alluring secrets of your body at least fifteen minutes before seeing or touching them. - Do you want some coffee? - No, thanks. I think a real rebel... must be unbridled in his thoughts and feelings. But, as you can see, I'm not a rebel. I'm a slave to our contract. And at this very moment I'm enslaved by the second paragraph. I don't speak of your beauty. I only speak of your lips. Lips that luckily are not too provocative. But, thanks to their unique character, thanks to their shape, contour and colour, they promise a bewildering sensual experience. - Here's to your lips, Pelagia. - Bazyli... That was awful. That was the first time I've spoken like that in my life. It's a rebellion. - It's a narrow margin of freedom. - Whatever. There will be no kissing. Contracts are made to be broken. - If we go on like this... - We'll be model workers. Why did you turn off the radio? My dear Bazyli, maybe I'll say something trivial. But all our efforts... You don't have to say it. - They're pointless. - Don't interrupt me. I mean in our life. In general. Our life is meaningless. And if there is a meaning, it's beyond human understanding. - Should I start recording? - Just stop and think. Anything for you. Think of a small, grey sparrow. What is it doing? Anything. It's a nice bird. But what does it know about the Mayans? Or the fall of the Roman Empire? And television? And nuclear physics? The future of cybernetics, the ideological crises... Dodecaphonic music, electronic music... All these things, and many others, are non-existent to our sparrow. - They simply don't exist. - Lucky sparrow! Let me remind you we're supposed to be having an intelligent conversation. I'd say it's a speech. Are we any wiser than the sparrows? Older people say that we, young people, can't see past ourselves. It's possible. But how could we be any different? Our generation has no illusions. It's obvious to us that we know nothing of the world we live in. We're worse than the sparrows. What do you study? This is an intellectual conversation, not a questionnaire. What about me? That's the reason for our anxiety, our rebellion against the establishment. - We know we're lost and lonely. - And progress in human knowledge? There is progress. But the field of human knowledge in comparison to the great unknown is like an arithmetic progression in comparison to a geometric one. A reasonable person knows that human life is a game. One has to bet on different numbers to have better chances of winning. Some people always bet on the same numbers. How about you? I think we're an exceptional generation. Don't you think? I don't care about it. What do you care about? Comfortable shoes, good cigarettes, good socks. I like lying in bed. Even alone. - Jazz? - I don't have an ear for music. I like boxing. - Crossword puzzles? - A passion. And dislikes? Having a hangover... Being pressured. I hate wild strawberries. - Memories... - I have a poor memory. Dreams? I like my motorbike. If I won the lottery I'd buy a good car. - I would start travelling. - A Mercedes would be OK. 240,000 zloty. Where would you go? - Testing my geography? - Imagination. Italy, Paris. And then Spain, or maybe Greece. I wouldn't go to Greece. I'd like to see Italy. Paris... And I'd go to America. Six months, or at least two. - Life could be very interesting. - And beautiful. Maybe. Interesting, that's for sure. It's possible that if I had some money I'd buy myself a small house. In the countryside. Three, four rooms. What are you laughing at? Bazyli has dreams. Poor little boy, overwhelmed with his boring life. He's dreaming, longing for something he doesn't even have a name for. What's with you? - What is it? - You promised to bring the girl inside. Why did I bother messing about with the car? You didn't manage it? She ran off? Aha, OK. - Go home, Edmund. - I will, but she won't. - Who? - Lean out and I'll tell you. - Who? - Mirka. She's crying. She's had too much wine. - Come down and help me. - Are you crazy? Take her away. - I can't do this alone. - Where are the boys? - At the club. Be careful! - I'm not going to fall. Go away, please. - Go! - Don't worry, man. - I'm not worried. - Don't fall out of the window. Listen up! - I'll explain it tomorrow. - There's nothing to explain. - Are you walking home? - Too late for that. - I'll sleep at the stadium. - Quiet! Your health! Hang on! And catch! Ciao! We need to go. It's over for today. Come on! - You... - What? Do you like wild strawberries? If you let me take you home I'll like you a lot. I want wild strawberries. - I want wild strawberries! - Come on, listen... - He doesn't like wild strawberries. - Oh my word... Why doesn't he like them? He'll learn to like them. - What did he say? - What? - What did he say? - We woke him up. He wants to sleep. Blah-blah-blah. Oh, my word... _ Let's go! ' No! Come on... Let's go to school, my lassie... - Pelagia, what's your real name? - Pelagia. - Here's to your friend. - Just a moment. Stop messing about. We're here thanks to him. - It was a joke. - Like everything in our lives. Everything? Bazyli, you're in breach of contract. - My name isn't Bazyli. - Earth calling Bazyli! - What are you thinking about? - You. It was wise to leave the club. We started off on the wrong foot. I know. - I like you a lot, you know. - I know. - Do you like me? - More or less. Maybe a little more than less. - Do you have another box? - No. Why? Do you have one? - No. Why? - No problem. We can play, anyway. Zero. One. Five. What are we playing for? What will you bet? - Myself. - Your clothing is enough. If I win five points you give me a piece. - And vice versa. - The winner chooses the piece. I'll strip you off. - Are you on? - Of course. - Tails. - Heads. Heads. One. Zero. Zero. Well? It's a tie. Zero... Five. - What do you want? - Your shoes. Both shoes? Your turn. Zero. Zero. Zero. Zero. Zero. Five. - Socks? - Trousers. Don't you pay your debts? Your turn. One... Zero. One. Come on. Your turn. Come on! Zero. Five. I have two more points. Your turn. Zero. One. So it's three. Zero. Five. Together that makes 13. - Take your shoes. - Your turn. Zero... Five. 18 in total. You're a born capitalist. Your top and your skirt belong to me. And I have three points left. Don't count that. I wasn't playing. - Are we still playing? - Of course. My turn. Top or bottom? - I am a gentleman. - You're a fool. Do you prefer scrambled eggs or fried eggs? - Scrambled eggs or fried eggs? - Scrambled are OK. Scrambled are OK. Runny or well done? - Runny or well done? - Medium. Medium... There are over 20 recipes for scrambled eggs. It's crazy. - I'm sorry. It's me who's a fool. - Stop it. I'm cooking. It's all right. - I'm not sure. - Nor am I. - Do you have any bread? - Over there. Have a look for it. - What are you looking for? - Another teaspoon. There is only one teaspoon. Take a fork. It's a pity you don't have any chives. True. It's good to be a gardener. Or a forester. - Not sharp at all! - What? Not sharp! The forester? Who? What? The knife. Let me do it. Is this enough? Well? Are you happy? Ladies and gentlemen, it's the end of our show. Nothing to look at. Please leave the theatre. The actors need to rest. Pelagia! Here's to our overwhelming success. You forgot the author. Of course. Our contract. Our draft. The spirit of our time. He's generous. He's omnipresent: on the ground, in the air, in our dreams and reality. He'll forgive us the small oversight. Sometimes we forget him, but we follow the book to the letter. Even if some texts are an assault on common sense. What are you thinking of? Sorry for the stupid question. - Are you in a hurry? - No. - Tired? - Worse. I can't remember my lines. Focus and think. It's too hard. Pelagia, your self-criticism makes you touchingly human. Here is what I offer. Sleep regenerates the cortex. - Lie down and get some sleep. - Do you think it will help me? I am sure. You'll wake up and know what to say. And you? I'll imagine I'm a doctor and I'm on the night shift. And what will you do in real life? What will I do? What can I do? I'll clean up after dinner. Comfy? - A wildly enthusiastic speech. - How many letters? Nine. - Last letter, 'B'. - Dithyramb. You're right. And now... Transformation. 1, 2, 3... Lots of letters... 13. First letter, 'M'. Metamorphosis. Metamorphosis... You're brilliant. One of the theological virtues? I have no idea. Do you know anything about virtues? First letter, 'L'. Go away... Go away! What is it? - What is it? - It's 5:00am. Shit, how time flies! It's a pity you left. We had a party. Wiesiek hit Janusz, your Mirka got drunk. - My Mirka? - Whatever. - Jurek and Marta had a row. - What this time? - Can he spend the night here? - Sorry, no. I don't get you. Aren't you alone? - No. - Why aren't you in bed? - Are you in love? - Are you crazy? I'm very sorry, but I can't help you. Go to Wojtek's. Julia is out of town. Don't worry. You'll make amends. Polo! Stop. - Polo... - What? The carburettor's faulty... Stop fooling around! He'll get... It's a long way. The other side of town. - Don't you have any money? - At 5:30am? - I'll kill you! - You're no fighter. - I only have 10 zloty. - Maybe it's enough for a taxi. - That's all I have. - What a life! Poor and boring. - On Monday, I've got a criminal law exam. - Look out! They're back. I'm going to see 'Hamlet'. Have you seen it? - What time are we practising? - Why? - I'm just asking. - 3:00pm, at his place. - No changes? - No changes. - I'm going home. Goodnight. - Ciao! We need to practise the blues. I was too fast. - Right. - I was, wasn't I? He's a neurotic. What's the difference between a tape recording and real life? There is no difference. Life is like a tape recording. First you record something, then you check how it sounds and at the end you erase everything. Stupid, isn't it? - Stop messing around. - Health is the most important thing. The wise men of ancient times were looking for poisons, - medicines, philosopher's stones. - He's raving. We, the innocent sorcerers, - want to poison our hopes ourselves. - Nice speech. See you at 3:00pm. - We'll play badly again. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Komeda! - What? - You... - What? Tell me... the names of the three theological virtues. Now I've heard everything. Faith, hope and love. Faith. That's a lot. - Bye! - Bye... Attention! Forward march! Three, four! You weren't living if you weren't in the Navy Singing and dancing... Hello? Hello? Did you see a girl walking here? Light coloured coat, medium height. - Have you seen her? - No. Giddy up! Good morning. Have you seen a girl in a light coloured coat? She has red hair. Red hair? In a coat? Did she steal something? Damn it! You need to be careful, young man. They've got their methods. You don't even notice and you're done for. - When did the train to Otwock leave? - Just a moment ago. - And the next one? - 6:45am. - Platform ticket please. - Here you are. - How much is it? - 1.20 zloty. - How much? - 1.20. Edmund! - What is it? - Listen... The girl. - Which one? - That one. Ah, that one! Are you crazy? I'm not mad at you. Let me sleep. - Edmund... - What? Do you know anything about her? Who slept with her? You or me? You should know. Who is she? Oh, my word... - How should I know? - You met that man. Who is he? You're completely nuts. We didn't introduce ourselves. Go to sleep. - Where did you leave him? - Go to sleep. And stop pawing me. - You... - He just got out. - Where was it? - Stop pawing me. Well? Listen... What happened? Stop pawing me. Do you know anything? Have you got a problem? Funny, isn't it? For costing me my victory! Edek! Take care of this guy! There's a referral on the table. Good morning, Bazyli. Just a moment... I'll wash my hands. - Did you go for a walk? - I went out of town for a short while. I went for a walk, too. I can see that. You didn't get enough sleep, Pelagia. I'm not sleepy. I feel great. I've made some tea. - How many sugars...? - None. - None? - It spoils the taste. Did you hear me coming in? Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't have said "good morning". - What would you have done? - I don't know. Maybe I'd have visited the bathroom and washed my hands. In a way, it was quite funny. - Wasn't it? - I'm not so sure. Nor me. - It's 7:35am. - I have to go. I'm taking it with me. That's avarice. For half an hour I thought I was in love... Goodbye, Bazyli. Good bye. Restoration Credits
