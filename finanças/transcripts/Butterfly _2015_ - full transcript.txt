BUTTERFLY I don't know how you could see it. Oh, look. How cute. Sorry for staying in the car. I didn't understand. How? - How strange. What do we do? - I don't know. Well... How weird. Come. What's up? Everything's alright. It's OK, beautiful. What's the matter? You peed your pants. Give me. - What are you doing? Are you dumb? - It was empty. That's no excuse for throwing it out the window. Are you OK? How can you cross like that? - I didn't see you. I'm sorry. - Are you hurt? - Just a scratch... - Do you have a tissue? No, I don't. Hey, are you alright? - Where do you live? - Close by. - Let's give her a ride. - Do you want a ride? - It's not necessary. - We'll give you a ride, come on. - I live close from here. - It's no big deal. We'll take you. Can you walk? - See? - It's nothing. We'll put you some hydrogen peroxide, I have some in the glove box. Come, we'll drive you. - Do we have some water to give her? - No. Keep going straight from here, and you'll see a road to the right. No, you go and talk to her yourself. Remember the last time we went there. Hey, could you turn down the music, come on. You know what? Call me later and we'll see. - That record is mine. - Can I borrow it? - If you ask me, sure. - Idiot. If I want I can break it now into a million pieces. It's mine. Do whatever you want. You'll get in trouble. I don't give a fuck. I can see your cock with that short. Put some underwear. I haven't got dressed yet. You're sick. Why don't tell Bruno? When we play football his is always loose... Why do you watch? You like it? So that's how it works? If you watch, you like it? Then why do you watch? You like it? Don't drag Bruno into this. When did I say something about your girlfriend? All the time. Yesterday you say he bought the same... Get out of here, idiot. I don't want discuss with you. You're boring. - What's up? - Let's go. - What's your name? - Bruno. Come. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. You, Romi? - Good. - Your mom? At home. - Mariela is home? - Yes. - I'll go in. - Alright. Sometime I laugh and my mom just stares. I know I remind her of him. - Of course. - She never told me, but I just know it. Hey, are you going to see again the guy who took you to the hospital? German. Yes, I guess so. - Mariela. - What? Mom says you should buy what she asked you to. - OK. - Hi. - Hi. - Bye. Get lost. - OK, but don't forget. - No. What's up with Juan Pablo? Nothing. I like your brother. But he treats me like his little sister. I flirt with him, but he doesn't seem to notice. - You flirt? - Yeah. - Why don't you get us something to drink? - You go. No, I'm shy around Juan Pablo. - Come on, I don't wanna. - OK, I'll go. You smoke too much. - Says who? - It's bad for you. When will your boyfriend be back? Why did you ignore me the other day, when you passed by with your sister? Because he knows my girlfriend. What could I do? Why don't you fuck your girlfriend? She wants to wait. I don't know. I'm getting a tattoo. What? A little bird, with a flower. Cool. OK, I'm leaving now. See you. - Bye. - Bye. - Ger, how are you? - Fine. You? - Hey, is your sister home? - I have no idea. - Maybe you knew. You live together. - I have no idea. - You OK? - Everything's fine. You didn't play football with us on Friday. No, I stayed in, watching a movie with Romina. What a little liar, she told me she had to study. - I have to go now. - Are you going to your house? - I was on my way there. - Sure, I'll take you. OK, thanks. Hey, I can't fit here. Move back. - Alright? - Yeah. - Hey. How are you? - Hi. - How are you? - Good. We were close, and since we dropped you off here the other day... What? I don't know. I wanted to see how your knee was. - Oh. It's fine. - Cool. - Hello. - Hi. What's up? I don't know. Do you wanna come and see a movie, or have a drink? - Wanna come in? - I was kidding. No, really. Come in for a while. Alright. Bruno! Bruno! - Hi. - Hi. Bruno, Romina. - Hi, Mariela. - Hi. - Come in. - Sure. Hello. How are you, Bruno? - You alright? - Sure. Excuse me. Mariela's been waiting for you in the backyard for 40 minutes. - I didn't know she was coming. - Oh, God. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm fine. - All good? - You didn't tell me you where coming. - Yes, I told you yesterday. Yeah. - Hey. - Hi. Wait, stop. Your mother's downstairs. - Sissy. - I'm serious. I don't like it. How nice of you to come by. I missed you. Today we'll ask them again if you can stay, OK? Sure it's alright? Yeah, they'll make you sleep with German, but Whatever. Sure. Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Have you ever been to Cerro de la Cruz, maybe? Yeah, my aunt owns a store there. I think I know you from there. Your aunt owns a tailor shop? Yes. I've been there a million times. Once, I bought a bunch of white ribbons. - I don't remember. - Doesn't matter. It was that time I went with your brother. He came with me to get the ribbons. Is your brother a thin, tall guy with a blue truck? Yeah. - You remember her brother, but not her? - No, I remember the truck. My hair was different back then. Maybe that's why you don't remember. Sure, that's why. - Will you stay for dinner? - Yes, mom. - What do you want? - Checking you don't do anything weird. Ger, I brought you the drawings I mentioned you the other day. I had them today but forgot to tell you. Want to see them? When did you see my brother? I brought him with my bike. - Go show him to his room. - OK. Measure your cocks, while you're at it. See who's got it bigger. Romina! What? Don't talk that way. This one. It's really good. Yeah, still... The one I like the most is... This one. Yeah dork, you showed it to me the other day. - There was another one I liked. - I don't know. This one's finished? - This part's missing, but it's almost done. - I can see? - Which one? - Any. - It's good. - Thanks. - And Romina? - I think she's dyeing her mom's hair. - This one? - No. - I'm going to the bathroom. - OK. - It's busy, go downstairs. - OK, thank you. This pants make me too much bulge, don't they? - Can I come in? - Sure. It's your house. Sorry for abandoning you. Mariela went out for beers. Wanna go outside? - Sure. Tell us later how much is it. - We'll see later. - What? - Nothing. I started music school first, but my father's a doctor, so I thought it'd be for the better. - Maybe next year I'll move to Buenos Aires. - I studied medicine in La Plata. Oh, yeah? Yeah, but spent all my days playing the guitar. I didn't want to do something I wasn't really into. So I formed a band now. It's good, I think. But we're just beginning, playing covers. It's more complicated, but my parents supported me. So now I give lessons. - Starting step by step. - That's nice. - Do you play any instruments? - I sing. I get a little shy with audiences, though. Ger heard me a couple of times. Right, baby? Yeah, she's good. - Should I get more beer? - Sure. Do you want to borrow shorts? No, it's alright. I sleep naked. - How do I climb up? - Over there, that way. - Should I turn off the lights? - No, wait. Let's talk for a while. Are you doing something tomorrow? No. Why? That girl makes me so hard. I'd fuck Mariela too, but Romina is so fucking sexy. Do you mind if I lay down there? This bed is filled with stuff. No, I don't. Alright. I'll go get a smoke and then I'll sleep above. You have one for me? - Expecting Bruno? - What, are you jealous? - Your boyfriend is huge fag. - Oh, yeah? He knows how to give me exactly what I want. He acts strange around me. I think he messes with me. How so? He started walking around the room, almost naked. - You are always walking around naked. - Yeah, when we're friends. When you play football don't you shower all together? Yeah, but it's different. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. - Want some? - OK. And what do I get? Everything is yours. I'm with her to make you jealous. Can you go grab the Coke and Fernet, please? - OK. - Want some help? OK. - You like Mariela? - What? Yeah, I don't know. She's cute. Why? I don't know. I won't care if you like her. And do you like me? - Got get the glasses. - "Go get the glasses." - Are you kicking me out? - Yes. Alright. - Not those. The others. - Oh, OK. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - How nice to see you. - I brought your book. - Thank you. - Can I help? - Sure. What are you doing? It's cold. Want some, Bruno? Yeah. Come here. - Everyone drinks? - Yeah. The other day I read that ants don't sleep. And that "J" is the only letter that isn't on the periodic table. What do you study? Music. - Yeah. - Cool. - Wanna hear some music? - I'll choose. - How's it going? - Good, you? What's wrong? Nothing. - You got something there. - Where? - Here. - What? Come on, cut it out. Oh, look. Who am I? - You didn't guess. - No. I'll leave your clothes here. German, what's up with your sister? She said you don't want to take her to the tailor. Do me a favor, take her and try your suit. When you come back, bring me the pizza molds from Carmen's house. - Mom, can't she go by herself? - German, please! - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - How are you? - I'm here to try a coat and a shirt. - Are you Mono's son? - Yes. - Aha. He's inside. - What's up, dumbass? - How's it going, dad? - It suits me well. - Oh, that's good. Did mom tell you we're having dinner at your aunt's house? - Yes, she told me. - Alright. I'll go get the car, then. - OK. - Bye, Rita. Thanks. - Bye. He looks just like you. - Yeah, right? - Bye, dad. - Bye. - Go ahead, I'll bring you your things. - This way? - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. I just got it. - It's done? - I'll go get it now. - Hey. - Hi. What's up? I knew I'd find you here. You were looking for me? Maybe. - That's the suit. - That one? I didn't see you last time, but I remembered you help your aunt, no? Yeah, sometimes. Should I change here? Oh, sorry. Does it makes you uncomfortable? Not at all. Am I nice? - You're gonna get a wedding? - Yes. What? I was picturing you as a bride. In white? I pictured you as my bride. The other day I thought about you. Why? It's a bit weird. A couple of days ago I went with my mom to the cemetery, to cremate my grandmother after taking her out from the grave. And the night before I dreamt that... she was laying on a table. Beautiful, as I remembered her, but she was like a mix between a woman and something else. She had like... her skin was like a tree bark. She was still. And suddenly she gasped and open her eyes, looking lost. Her eyelids moved fast. But I wasn't scared. I thought it was a beautiful picture. Like she had to be woken up so she could move on to another world, or something. I don't know what I'm saying. And why did you think of me? I think because the other day you were saying... that when you were 12 or 13 years old, you used to wake up crying. Because you thought you would die. I'll carry on. It looks great. Don't leave. You are beautiful. - Wait here. - Where are you going? I'll be right back. Hey, dad told me you asked Bruno to come tomorrow. Yeah, why? I thought we could spend some time alone. Oh, I didn't realize. I'll tell him not to come. No, don't. Mom has already told Mariela. - Hi. - Hi. I don't know. It's not such a big deal, right? I just wanted to be with you. That's it. See you later. Hey. Hey. Did you bring Bruno a swimsuit? Remember I asked you? Hey. The trunks. It's in my backpack, in the trunk of the car. Is this the one? It's hideous. I don't know, I grabbed the first one I found. I can't give him this. Give him yours. Come on. - Here. - Thank you. This fabric takes forever to dry. Yeah. Girl, your boyfriend touched my dick. Do you want me to fuck him to make you realize? What are you talking about? - Give me a hand, will you? - In a minute. When I was young I used to come here to fish with my dad and my brother with a BB gun. One time they stayed here and I went into the woods... and I spotted a woodpecker on a tree, right? So I grabbed the rifle... I aimed. And I noticed it wasn't moving, so I got a little bit closer. I blew it's head off. I cried for three days after that. So you were also a fag back then. Hey, listen, Mariela needs to go back. Wanna leave? - Yeah, sure. I'm also a little bored. - OK. - I'll take you. - OK. Here they come. Where do you have to go? To my aunt's Family dinner. - Cool. - Super cool. A pain in the ass. You're going with Juan Pablo? Why, you want to come? We're leaving, Ger is kind of bored. So... - You didn't want to come, did you? - No. I have to leave, anyway. I'm not bored, but since he's leaving, he'll give me a ride. Can you take them both? - Why? - So I can hang for a while. You're staying? Yeah, wanna stay? Sure. I can take you both, it's not a problem. I don't want her to be alone. OK, bye. - See you tonight, OK? - Alright. - You got something in your eye. - Here? No, let's see. - Where? - There. - Here? - Yes, here. - Bye. See you. - See you. - Hi, dad. - Your mom will kill you. - Girl, we we're waiting you. - I'll go get a jacket. - Got one here. Let's go. - Juan Pablo? Because. Bye, dad. Hey! Hey! You're out of gas? Hum, yeah. Yes, I ran out of gas. I have some. - It's that, right? - Yeah, it is. But it happens all the time. - I don't wanna play anymore. - Come on! Ger, wanna go in? Your trunks won't dry. You'll get my bike's seat wet. This is nice, isn't it? Yes. Thanks. Why did you stay if you were so bored? Hold on. What about Mariela? What about Bruno? Just do whatever you want to do. My mom keeps the fridge her. - The Coke is cooler. - Great. You are not my sister's boyfriend, are you? No. - We're just friends. - Nothing else? Nothing else. What? Are you staying a while? Yeah. - Ger, can you give me a ride? - I don't have the bike. - I'm going that way. I'll take you. - Alright. - Are you staying? - No. - Bye. - Bye. - It's here. - Oh. - I leave it here? - Yes. - Hey, I'm sorry, alright? - Don't worry, we have for sure. Ger! - Here, I brought beer. - Thank you. - See how long my hair was? - Yeah. You like it? Sure. - Let's go to the patio. - Alright. Thanks. Ger has quite a temper. Yeah, he got really mad. - How long you've been dating? - A year. You have a brother, don't you? Yeah, he's been traveling for two years. He's coming back soon. Nothing happened. - My parents arrived. That's their truck. - Oh. Let's go. When will I see you? - Whenever you want. - Alright. - Alright? - Alright. Get lost. - German. - What? - What happened with Mariela? - I don't know, get lost. - May I? - Yes. Are you alright, sweetheart? Yes, why? I saw Bruno downtown. It's alright. Seriously, don't worry. Did you read it? I liked it. Yes, I liked it. I was unbearable. So we got scared. We didn't know what to do. So finally we turned on a little fan. Didn't do any good, it was a really old one. And we just left it there. We brought the other one, polished it... But where did it come from? From an a acquaintance... - Is your sister here? - Yes she is. - Is she around? - She is, yeah. And we got it fast, right there. Imagine the smell. The smell. And it's different, because with gas it's not the same. The one from the fridge is different, it's like gassy. - What's up? - All good? Stop staring at them. It's for your own sake. What are you gonna do? Punch him? No. They make a cute couple. Bruno and Juan Pablo. Again with that. Well, it's obvious. - Can you bring me something to drink? - OK. - Do you want it? - Is it for me? - Yes. - Thank you. What happens with Mariela? We broke up. Today. Bruno is spending a lot of time with Mariela's brother, don't you think? What do you mean? Do you want to smoke? - Sure. - Let's go outside. What did you leave Romina? - Well... She's all yours. - What? I mean, I'm going to tell her we're done. I told him to stop being a little bitch, and tell her. Are you kidding me? What, man? I knew. How many times did you want... - to fuck me? - No, come on. - Come on, it's not like that. - Not him. - What, you're getting jealous? - Not jealous. You've got to trust. - Got to trust, right? - Got to trust. Well, should we go tell her? - You go. - Well, come with me. OK, I'll join you. - Keep watch. - I will. - I'll keep watch. - Let's go. - You're staying? - I am. - That's my jacket. - It is? Want to go for a walk? Sure. - Is he staying over? - I think so. - He sleeps with you. Not with your sister. - OK. - I like your room. - Do you? Yes. Is that you? Yeah, I was just a boy. Very cute. Do you fish or is it just an ornament? Sometimes I do, with my uncle. Why don't you take off your jacket? Get comfortable. Come. I'll teach you a game. Close your eyes. - How obvious. - No, really. Look. See that line? Yeah? I'll caress you with my hand. And when I reach that line, you tell me to stop. Yes? If I move past that line or stop before I reach it, you lose. - Alright. - OK? Close your eyes. Stop. I could've sworn you passed it. Why? I don't know. That's the game. OK, now do it with my leg. Wake up! Wake up! Romina! Wake up. We overslept, and we have to be in church in five minutes. Your brother didn't sleep here, so take his bike and we'll meet you there. Come on, get dressed. Now! Come on. Son! We're late for Momi's wedding. Your dad overslept. Here's your shirt. Hey, gorgeous. I'm sorry, but German is in a hurry. Come on, hurry up! If you wait for me to change, I'll take you to your place. - Hey, dad. - Hi, baby. - Can you wake up your brother? - Sure. Fuck! - Did you cut yourself? - Yes. We need a doctor to see it. Come on, let's go.
