[gentle music] - [Interviewer] Please state your name and age. - My name is Debbie Smith and I'm 24 years old. - [Interviewer] Please state your name and age. - My name's Sean, I'm 29 and I live in Southsea. - [Interviewer] Please state your name and age. - Martha Johnson. 25. - [Interviewer] Please state your name and age. - My name's Graham and I'm 64 years old. - My name is Rebecca, I'm 26 years old. And this experiment is to look into the psychological effects after playing with the Ouija board. - [Rebecca] Okay, so, I'd like to begin by removing all external variables, so if you could please give me your phones and I'll put them to one side. [phones clatter] Thank you. Thanks very much. Okay, now we're going to light the candles to try and create a suitable ambience. I'm not sure what effect this will have, [lighter clicking] but it's worth giving everything a go. [lighter clicking] Okay, if you just like to pass that round and to the others for me, thank you. [table rattles] [lighter clicking twice] [lighter clicking] [lighter clicking] - [Sean] Cheers. [lighter clicking] - [Rebecca] Thank you very much. - [Sean] You're welcome. - [Rebecca] Okay, we will now begin the Ouija board session. [planchette rattles] Is there anybody there? - [Sean] Oh my god. - [Rebecca] How many spirits are with us? Tell us a bit about yourself. - What, like ... - [Rebecca] Where you work, family, why you wanted to take part in this experiment. - Okay, well I work at a local Grace's. Been married for a couple of years now and I thought it might be good escapism, something a bit different. - I'm currently working at Warm Side Home Improvements. Not to brag, but I'm the best sales agent there at the moment. Currently living with my girlfriend Lacey in sunny Southsea. Signed up for this 'cause I thought it would be a laugh. And if we see a demon, even better. - I'm self-employed. I make little dolls like this, which seem to sell well. And I got involved in this experiment because it's not just a belief, I actually dedicate my life to this, so. - I was hoping this would get me out of the house more. I was a carpenter, but I'm retired now. Happily retired, yeah. - [Rebecca] Okay. So now I'd like each of you to ask a question, starting with you, Debbie. - [Debbie] How many spirits are there? - [Graham] Can you point to the number of spirits that are with us? - [Martha] Are you a good or an evil spirit? - [Sean] Oh my God. W. I. L. - [Martha] Will. Wills ... - [Graham] Wells ... - [Martha and Debbie] Will see? - [Sean] Will see. Are you a demon? [planchette slides and taps firmly] - [Martha] Goodbye. - [Sean] Shit, did I fuck it up? - [Rebecca] I don't know. - Yo, so here we are. Is this thing on? Let's have a look. Yeah, there we go. Okay. So we've been there, we've done the, I mean I'm, I'm calling it a seance. They call it an experiment. But, for the next 30 days, we're gonna be filming everything that goes on in this apartment to see if we can catch some kind of like, I don't know, like ghostly or otherworldly experience. So here we are. Let's start with the tour. Here is the bathroom, nice and cozy. And then let's move out here into the hallway. So here we are in our nice little studio by the seaside. So behind me is the kitchen area, as you can see, nice little functional kitchen area in our studio. And then we've also got the computer just behind me there. And then the TV over there as well. 'Cause you know, you gotta relax and have fun sometimes. And then me here is our nice little bed as well. So all pretty compact, you know, you can see it's, it's pretty tight but it's a nice place to be. Anyway. For now, I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee 'cause I'm craving one. But yeah, for the next 30 days you're gonna be seeing a lot of me and Lacey. And hopefully we can catch some crazy shit on camera for you. Catch you next time. [Sean sips coffee] [hangers rattling] - [Lacey] Ooh. So the wedding's at 1:00 PM, yeah? - Ah-huh. - You're not filming me, are you? - No. Don't be so paranoid. - Ugh, okay. Okay, right. [hangers rattling] Think I've got a few outfits in mind. Oh, I really hope that we don't see your sister though, to be honest, 'cause you know, I can't handle much more baby talk. Okay. What about ... this? What do you think? - Hmm? Nice. - Yeah. - LBD. - Yeah, I like it. I think we might have to go with that one. - Yeah? - You are filming me. [smacking noise] - No, I'm not. - Yeah, you are. You're filming me. - I'm slightly not, at all. - You're gonna have to stop doing that. - At all. Not even slightly. - Stop it. Please. Stop. - Turn it slightly away. How about that? - Fishy nothing's happened yet. - Yeah. But like what did you expect to happen? - Demon. - Right? Just demon. - Yeah. You know, demon. You know, big old demon dick. [deep voice] Like, Satan's cock. - What? [chuckling] What are you talking about? [laughter] - Be the most metal experiment ever. - Who have you been hanging out with? [laughter] What have you been watching, more like? Yeah, I thought as much. But like, what would you do if I got possessed? - What, like possessed, possessed? Like, 360 head spin, vomit and shit? - Yes. What would you do? - I'd leave you to clean it up. [chuckles] - Well, doesn't make a difference then. [laughter] Yeah, but like really? What would you do? - See? The camera's your friend. - Oh, you're such a creeper. Why are you still filming me? - Because we have to film everything. - Well, we're just, we're just in bed. Like, I don't think they're gonna like, just seeing this. This is not fun. - What, they said, every little thing. - Right, okay. In case there's ghosts. - Well, it's a little bit more ... - They're just gonna be chilling here with us, are they? - What, a little bit more complicated than that, but. - Yeah. - I don't think so. - No? - But okay, fine. If, have you caught anything now? Have you caught anything yet? - Only from you. [laughter] - Nice. Cheers. Thank you. [soft thumping pat, laughter] - Watch out for the camera! - Oh yeah, sorry, university. Don't want you to, like, miss out on anything, - Well, yeah, I mean, you know what the camera really wants to see? - What? - Something like ... - Oh, okay. - This. [silly noise from Sean] - I really don't think they're gonna wanna see that, I'm afraid. - Oh, you never know, May spice things up a bit. - Well, none of that's gonna happen on camera anyway, so you might wanna consider what you're doing. Just, I'll get back to my book then. If you're just going to film me this whole time. - Sorry, university. [strange breathing] [covers sliding, mattress creaking] [Lacey inhaling sharply] [Lacey sighing, heavy breathing] [pillows and covers rustling] Right, I watched some of the phone footage back last night, and I'm telling you something happened. Now I, I don't know what it was, but it wasn't me. It wasn't her. But that duvet moved. I can't talk too long cause she's in the bathroom. Oh, I think she's coming. [Sean clearing throat] - [Lacey] Oh my god. - What? - Look at this. - What is that? Are you seeing this? - It's, I think it's a bruise. - Oh my God! Okay. Okay, let's get a close up on this for the, the university people. - Oh, stop it. You think it's supernatural? - It could be. - Stupid idiot. - Oh, come on. - Like, it's like, it's like a burn or something. - It does look, yeah. - It doesn't really, like, hurt though. - Is it, is it hot to the touch? - No. - No? Okay. - No, stupid. - You're not coming down with something then. - No. - Oh my God. - Weird. Help me, what the fuck? - Okay. Have we have we got, have we got that on, on camera for the, for the people at the place? For the university. You seeing this? - Ooh. - You seeing this? - How am I gonna go to work? - What, luckily I have four fingers and not three. So you know it's not me. - I don't care if it's you or not. Like, actually do you know what? If it is you, at least I can tell people that like, you hit me more than I hit you. - Okay. [quiet rustling and thumping] [guitar strings plucking and reverberating] I can't shut. [Elvis-like accent] Today, I'm gonna do a special performance for you.

[strings squeaking and ringing] - So here we are. I've been called back from work early, yes, by Lacey 'cause she heard a big bang noise. And it's scary. I haven't heard anything since I've been here yet. But thought we'd get the camera out just to document it. As you can see, no levitating beds. So that's all good. No kind of Poltergeistey covered doors opening or closing. - How long are we gonna do this for? - About another two weeks. - Two weeks. - You said you were cool with this. - I don't wanna do this anymore. - What? - I really don't wanna. - Are you that scared? - I don't want to be here anymore on my own. - Babe, look, it's gonna be okay. Like. - Really fucking scary. yeah. You weren't there, but tell you what, you know what, it's on there. - Yeah? - Yeah. Watch it back if you don't believe me. - Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay. I, I believe you. Hold on. [quiet, peaceful breathing] [Lacey moving in her sleep] [otherworldly moaning] [Lacey whimpering] [Lacey breathing harder] [Lacey whimpering and moaning] [otherworldly cries grow more intense] [Lacey whimpering and crying] [Lacey exclaiming in terror] Oh my God! Oh my God, oh my God, my God! [Lacey crying] - Babe, what's wrong? - Oh my God! - Lacey! Lacey! Lacey. - Fucking, fucking pulled me down the bed. - What? What do you mean, what do you mean someone pushed you down the bed? Babe. - Oh, I've gotta get outta here. This isn't happening to you. [loud slap] This is happening to me. Let me go. - Come, come here. It's okay. [Lacey sobs] It's okay. It's alright. - All this havoc, I'm scared. [Lacey sobbing pitifully] I can't sleep here. I can't. - Hey, Lace. We'll, we'll, we'll figure this out a little bit. It'll be okay. Okay, so can you just show me your ankle quick please? Is it sore? - Mmm. - So you can see all around here. There's like really, really bad bruising and marks. And it goes all the way around the ankle as well. Babe, can you show me your arm? It's still there, right? So the arm, you see and it's really, really sore on top as well. And then can you, can you show me your neck? Yeah, that's the worst one. It is really, really, really red. It's almost like burnt. Are you okay? So I got the ankle, the arm, and the neck. Yeah. Right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call the lady at the university. - [Rebecca] Hello? - Alright. It's, it's Sean from the Ouija experiment. - [Rebecca] Oh, hi Sean. How's it going? - Yeah, yeah, it's all right. But I think we're gonna have to call it quits. - [Rebecca] Oh. Oh, has something happened? - Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's been affecting my girlfriend. - [Rebecca] Affecting her how? - Sleep bites on her. I, I don't really know how to explain it. It's, it's visible, but she's been getting nightly visitors. - [Rebecca] Visitors? - Yeah. I'll, I'll send you over the footage. You can judge for yourself. - [Rebecca] Okay, thank you. Well, there is only 10 days left. Do you think you could hold out another 10 days? I mean, I could come and visit and make it clear to her that it's all psychological. - I'll try my best. - [Rebecca] Sean. - Yeah. - [Rebecca] Nothing's happened to you? - No. Has anything happened to anyone else? - [Rebecca] I can't really tell you that. - Okay, well, [Sean clearing throat] I'll, I'll speak to her and see how she feels about it. - [Rebecca] Thank you, Sean. - Thanks. Bye. And welcome back to the 'Best Boyfriend in the World Show.' It's me, Sean, and we are here in the kitchen area. So as you can see, we've got some lovely chili going on here. We've got three different kinds of beans and two different kinds of meat. Lacey's absolute favorite 'cause she's a babe. Oh, I think that may be her now. I've cleaned the place so we should be onto a roll. And I've, [doorknob rattling] called the lady, so. [door unlocking] Well, hello. - Hi! - How you doing? You okay? - Hey, yeah. Good. - Welcome home. - Yeah. Ugh. So good to be home. - Yeah? - Yeah. - So I was just telling the camera how amazing, muah, I've been. - Because I'm cooking you dinner. - Missed you. - Are you really? Yeah. Missed you too. - Give me two seconds. - Yeah, no worries. - How's mom? - What's for dinner? - Dinner? Dinner is your favorite. - Yeah? - Three different kinds of beans. Two different kinds of meat in a chili. - Amazing. - So how's mum? - You cleaned! - Yeah. - Wow. - A little bit. Yeah. - Aww. Thank you. - I told you, who's the best boyfriend in the world? - Yes, you are. - Yeah. - So, speaking of which. - Yeah? - How is everything? What did they say? - Okay, so I called them up, like I said I would. - Yep. - And she then turned around and said, you know, we sure can finish, you know, it's only 10 days left. I told her what happened to you. - Right. - And she said that she wanted to come around and have a chat actually. - Okay. - And like, make sure, like, you're okay. Kind of like, you know, - That's nice. - Make sure you're okay, like psychologically and everything as well, like, - What? - Yeah. Right? - What do they mean? - So, I don't know, but she then - - Is that crazy? - Well, I don't know. I think they just wanted to, to make sure. I guess some people have, - That's weird. - Reported different things, but yeah. And then she went back to the like, oh, you know, it's only 10 days left kind of thing. But. - Oh, what? So it's not, that doesn't sound like it's canceled. - Oh no, it is. It is. It definitely is. Yeah. - Oh. - No, seriously. Right? No. So, she said about the 10 days and I said, no, we're good. We're done. We're out. Fuck the 10 days. - We have to be. - Yeah. - Because I can't, I can't do this. - I know, I know. Don't worry. It's good. We're out. We're done, we're gone. - Oh, please. Really? - We're fine. Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, a hundred percent. - Oh. - Yeah. - You don't understand, such a relief. Like really. - It's okay. It's okay. - Oh, I just wanna be okay at home, you know, with you. - Yeah. - And just like, ugh. - Just chill, relax. - Yeah. And just have fun again. Like, I'm gonna go have a shower. - Okay then. - And then maybe we can celebrate and ... - Well, we do have the camera for one night only. - That we do, But, how, - Suggestive eyebrows. - Crazy idea. How about we lose the camera and we just have like a night, just me and you? - Hmm. - Maybe just, - Yeah, maybe? - Like have a little me and you time? Cause it's been a little while and, - Well, I. - Feeling pretty good, so. - Yeah? - Be an awful waste otherwise, don't you think? - Yeah. Well I think it would be a waste if we, - Yeah? - If we didn't get it on some kind of - - So I'm gonna go get ready for a shower, if you know what I mean. - Okay. So I'll put the camera away. - You wouldn't want to get it ruined. You know, wet, so. - True. - I think that's the best idea. - True. - Bye-bye. [Sean giggling] - Hmm, hmm. She didn't say turn it off. - Hello. - Hey. [laughter] Wow. - You know, it's been a while. - It has. - So I thought me and you needed like, some personal time. - That sounds like a plan. - Yeah? [Sean and Lacey kissing] So. I fucking knew it. [slapping sound] [sudden low demonic growling] - Lacey. Lacey? Lacey! [Lacey whimpers] [demonic growling intensifies] Augh! [Lacey screams] Lacey! Aah! - Nah! [Lacey continues shrieking] [demonic growling grows louder] - Lacey! [Lacey screaming in pain] [growling and tearing noises] [Sean crying out in pain] [anguished screaming and crying] No! No! Aah! [Sean and Lacey's screaming grows more pained] Oh, no! [Sean and Lacey scream in terror] - Hello, my name is Martha. I am participating in the Ouija board experiment for Portsmouth University. And I'm doing this because I am practicing Wiccan. Okay, so these are my candles. They are supposed to create a mystical and magical atmosphere during rituals. The red one, it's the color of fire and passion. It represents blood, love, sex, fertility, and power. And it instills energy and strength. The yellow one you use for confidence and charm, persuasion, mental strength. It stimulates your personal power and self-esteem. And finally, the black one. Now this absorbs all energies. It's often used to absorb or banish negativity, and it reverses curses and hexes. You can use it for protection. Banishing, repelling black magic. Now this is actually my pentacle and my other tools which sit on top of my altar. So earlier today, I did a Ouija board experiment. But I'm not expecting for anything to happen yet. [lighter clicking] Now to put my protection spells to rest, I call these walls to be unblessed. Let the sacred circle break and cease and open doors to all that please. [softly blowing out candle] [water running and splashing] Nothing happened last night. Kind of disappointed. No dreams, no voices, no marks. But I guess these things take time. [quiet rustling of fabric] [contemplative silence] [knocking] [Martha sighs] [more knocking] [insistent, percussive knocking] Okay. Geez. [feet stamping away] [door opening] Hi. - [Karen] Hey. Oh, don't wanna be putting the hex on me. - Well, you better not piss me off then. - So? What did it feel like? - What? Putting my hand on a bit of wood with some strangers? No, that doesn't sound right. [laughter] - Well, has anything happened yet? - No, nothing. Not yet, anyway. - Kinda sounds like you want something to happen. - Have you ever wanted to stare into the darkness? - Is this about Robin? - No. God, no. I'm, I'm just tired of this positive shit. I just wanna see something that's real. Do you want a cup of tea? - Yeah. - It's been four days and nothing's happened. I'm gonna try reaching out again. Come shadows, now, I call on thee, Come if thee be friend or fiend. Allow me now to be your vessel and guide me to your earthly treasure. [hurried page turning] [small gasp of pain] Oh my God. [frantic rustling] So after watching the footage back, I know after seeing this right there that I'm on the right track. This happened exactly after I cut my finger on the book. Coincidence? I don't think so. [dish clattering] [switch flipping] [silverware clattering] [tea kettle heating up] [knife clattering] [water boiling] [knife clanking to countertop] [quiet pouring] [plastic lid closing] - You can name him Robin. - What, like Robin Hood? [bird chirping] - No, I meant just Robin. - I know what you mean. - So. - When was the last time you got out of here? - I've been to the shops. - It's not exactly getting out, is it? You need to get out there. Socialize more, meet people. Whatever happened to that Wiccans group you were going to? I know they were weird, but at least there were people. [teacup clacking] You should go out with me this weekend. [Martha coughs] [bird chirps] - [imitating Karen] Why don't you come out with me this weekend? I mean, I love Karen, but I've got work to do. [bird warbling] She buys me a pet and then wants me to go out more. Now I've gotta look after this. Aww. He's kind of cute though. Oh, spirits come, I beckon you, Come until the morning light, Come before the night is due, Come and show me what is right. [Martha breathing heavily] [Martha's breathing quiets] [silence] [Martha sighs] So, as you've seen, the experiment failed. So I decided to go out with Karen, and now I'm hungover too. I'm gonna hit the books and work this out. So after doing a lot of research, I finally found it. [bird chirping] It turns out the blood has to be unwillingly given. I dunno why I didn't think of this. It just makes so much sense. It just ... [bird chirps] Sorry, buddy. Aww. [bird continues chirping] It's gotta be done. [hissing release of air] [Martha collapsing to the floor] Something actually happened, like I felt, I physically felt it. It was at the back of my neck, like a, [Martha blowing air] I know the camera didn't pick this up, but I had a vision. Lots of strange images. I need to work it all out. But two words came to me, like, very clearly. 'More blood.' [Martha breathing heavily] Right. Neighbor's cat always comes into my garden. I've already put a little bowl of fish out there and I've got this bad boy to catch him with. So should be okay. [knocking at the door] [door creaking open] - Hello. [door creaks open and clicks shut] Oh, it's cold out there. You're really getting into this recording thing, aren't you? [kettle switch flipping] - [Martha] Yeah. [plastic bag rattling] - Last weekend was so much fun. So we should definitely do it again. - [Martha] Yeah, it was great, but, why are you here? - I brought some food round for Robin. - [Martha] You should really let me know. - Well, I knew you'd be in, it's not like you leave the house. - [Martha] He escaped. - Robin? - Yeah. I must have left the cage door open. - Well, where did he go? Just, like ... - [Martha] I just found him in the garden. I think the neighbors cat must have got to him. - Oh, hun, I'm so sorry. - [Martha] No, just, put this down. - I must have brought up a lot for you. I never should have stressed with that name. - Can you just leave now please? - You don't need to be alone right now. - Yes, I really do. - Is that blood? - [Martha] Yes. From when I cut myself. - It's everywhere. - [Martha] Just, just leave it. - Oh my God. It's gonna stain! - Let it stain! Get the fuck out! [water running, then turning off] [door opening] [Martha stabbing and tearing] [Martha angrily grunting, stabbing] - Why the fuck has nothing happened yet? I, I dunno what I'm doing wrong now because it asks for more blood. I give it blood. And do you think it fucking responds? No. You're fucking mocking me. You just want me to become fucking pathetic and stupid like Robin. [shocked gasp] Great. You want my blood? Well, I'll get you more blood, but not mine. Fuck. - Hello? Hi. Look, I'm, I'm sorry too, okay? I was really stressed the other day and ... No, you're right. You were right. You know, I need to get out more and move on, so, I'm free if you wanna come around tonight. About eightish? Cool. Okay, I'll see you then. Cheers. Okay. [knocking at door, knife clatters] [quick steps, door creaks open] - [Martha] Hi. - [Karen] I'm sorry. - [Martha] No more apologies, okay? - [Karen] I brought brownies. - [Martha] Oh, thank you. - [Karen] Ooh, friends. - You want tea or something stronger? - Always something stronger. - Wine? - Yes. - Rose? - I knew there was a reason why I loved you. [wine pouring] Oh, are you trying to get me drunk? - Yeah. I'm gonna sacrifice you to a demon. - Ooh, she's a witch. Burn her, burn her. [glasses clink together] Aww. - Mmm. - Mmm. We haven't laughed like this since ... Robin. [bottle clinks] [heavy, hard smack] [Karen crashing to the floor] ♪ [Martha chanting in Latin] ♪ ♪ [Martha continues chanting in Latin] ♪ - Martha, what, Martha, what are you doing? [Karen struggling] Martha! Is this what Robin would've wanted? [Martha's chanting stops] - What did you say? Don't you dare mention his name. He's a fucking coward. He just killed himself because he wasn't strong enough, but not me. [book smacking onto the floor] I'm stronger than that. [clattering and struggling] [Karen shrieking and screaming] [silence] - Hello, Jenny, can you hear me okay? - Yeah, Dad. It sounds fine. - Bobby about? - No, you just missed him, actually. He's gone out with friends for the day. - What about little Lucy? - She's at college, Dad. - Right, whoa. Okay. Well, how's me favorite daughter? - Yeah, I'm fine. I've just been really busy. - Oh, aren't we all nonstop here? Did I tell you about that university experiment? - Yeah, you did mention that. How did it go? - Well, it hasn't really started yet. No bumps in the night. - Okay, Dad, well, I'll come round when things have calmed down a bit. - Oh, no rush, Jenny. I'm not going anywhere just yet. [Graham laughs] - Okay, Dad. Listen, I'm getting another Skype call through and it's a work thing. I'm gonna have to take it, I'm sorry. - No, don't apologize. It's all right. I'll give you a call tomorrow. - Could you make it after six? - No problem. Best get back to work. Love you. - Love you too, Dad. - [Graham] Oh, this is my flat. Not much to look at really. There's a lovely telly, bit too big for the room. And this is my family. My grandson, Robby. He hasn't been little for a long time now. And there's the love of my life. Diane. She passed away last year. God, I miss her. I, I'm not too sure what I should be filming actually. Now, according to those videos online, when you're asleep is the best time for ghoulies. So I'll just leave the camera running and check it in the morning. Night, night. [peaceful breathing] [covers shifting] Well, nothing happened last night. Mustn't be a sort of immediate type of thing. Shame, really, sort of. Pretty lonely round here. Oh, hi, Rebecca. Yeah, I just wanted to call in and say it's all going well so far. Nothing major's happened really, but I've been filming nonstop as you asked. - [Rebecca] That's great. These things take time though, so just keep filming and keep logging. - Yeah, will do. How are the others getting along? - [Rebecca] Oh, I'm not sure yet. You're the first person to be in touch. - Oh. [Graham laughs] Sorry, well, I'll best leave it to you then. You must be very busy. - [Rebecca] Oh, it's okay. Just keep filming and I'll be in touch soon. - Okay, Rebecca. But, you have a lovely day now. Okay, yeah. Take care, love. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [Graham] Wow, you wouldn't believe it. I saw this frame move just an inch. I think I'll set up a camera watch on it. If I've learned anything from watching those videos online, patience is everything. Come on, Diane. Do it for the camera. Well, I've been down the charity shop, and, ha ha! Look what I got dead cheap. Absurdly brilliant. So now, I know, I know it breaks the rules, but I'm gonna try and get in touch with, with Diane. So, here goes. "The Ouija board has been evil since 1973. Why 1973? That's the year the Exorcist was released into theaters. raising the horror genre to a new level, and would forever demonize this once effective communication device. That movie changed horror forever. [planchette scrapes quietly] And even today, many are unable to watch it. This makes it easy to see why all of those 'based on a true story events' would be feared. What caused the demon to possess Regan in the movie? [planchette scraping] The dreaded Ouija board did." Wow. Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there? What if the planchette is unresponsive? Oh no, the session is failing because the planchette is slow or not moving at all. [soft exhale] [quiet grunting] [planchette softly scrapes] Diane? [planchette scrapes] Diane? Yes. H. E. L. L. O. Hello, G. R. A. H. A. [planchette scraping] M. Graham. [planchette taps] L. O. O. K. Look. B. E. H. I. N. D. Behind. T. H. E, The. B. O. O. K. C. A. S. E. Look behind the bookcase. Diane managed to find our dad's war medals. He did our country proud, did our dad. - Hey dad. Everything okay? - Everything's fantastic, Jenny. - Oh? - Now, don't get cross. I just decided to carry on the experiment at home. - What do you mean? - Well, I bought me own board. - Board? Oh, isn't that a children's toy? - Children's toy? I spoke to your mother last night. - Just don't get carried away with that thing, Dad. - It happened, love. I'll send you over the footage if I can work it out. - No, Dad, just stop, okay? Is this what the university wants you to do? - I haven't really checked. I can't see it being a major problem though. - Just be careful, okay? I know what you're like. - Oh, and what am I like? - Just remember it's not real. I've got to go, but I'll call you tomorrow. We need to discuss Lucy's birthday. - Okay, love. Speak to you tomorrow. [planchette scraping] How ... is ... [planchette continues moving] Jenny? Oh, she's all right, love. Yeah, oh, you should see the children. They're really growing up fast. Absolutely fantastic. What's it like out there? [planchette taps and begins scraping] Lonely? Oh, well it shouldn't be. You got Uncle Rich out there. He was always good for a laugh, wasn't he? [Graham laughs] - Dad, I said I'll call you later. What's this video you sent me? - I needed your help. Your mother was trying to contact me. - I told you not to get carried away with that thing. - I'm not. I've got other videos of proof that she's trying to contact me. - Are you sure that's what they are? - Jenny, don't be condescending with me. I'm still your father. You may not want to understand this, but you can at least respect it. - Okay, Dad. If I'm honest, it doesn't really look like anything. It just looks like that piece of wood spinning or being blown from an open window or something. Anyway, while I've got you, what did you get Lucy for her birthday, and what time do you want me to pick you up? - Sorry, love. I'll put some money in a card. She'll probably prefer that anyway. Can you pick me up at three? - Okay. Dad, that's fine. Please don't mention any of this to her or anyone. - Okay. It is her birthday. I wouldn't want to distract from that. - Thank you. [planchette scraping and spelling out the word "LONELY"] [planchette moving and spelling out "LONELY" again] [planchette slides and spells out "JOIN ME"] - [Graham] Join you? Hello, love. Did we plan to chat today? - No. I really needed to talk to you. - Is everything okay? - Why is Lucy asking me if Granddad is okay? - Maybe she's just not used to me being happy again. - Or maybe it's because you told her that Mom is still here with you and you've been contacting her through a game. - Well, she's a big girl. She's got nothing to worry about. - I don't think you understand. Remember what we said to you before you moved in there? - That you'll try and support me as much as possible. I, I've always appreciated that. - We can't do it anymore. - What do you mean? - Money's been tight and we can't afford to help you live there. But we've arranged something for you. I just think it's for the best. - She said you'd do this. - Mom? - She warned me. - Dad, you are losing it. This is the best thing for you. Spending time alone talking to Mom is just crazy. Can't you see that? - I can't. She's the only thing that makes any sense to me now. - Dad, please. I love you. Can't you see that's why I'm doing this? - I'm sorry, but I've got to go. Diane. It's me. I'm wearing the suit I wore on our wedding day. [planchette softly scraping] Yeah, you were right about Jenny. Don't be. She's got no respect for me. I don't know what I did wrong. Oh, I miss you too, but it won't be long. Just let me take my medication. [pill bottle rattles] And, just grab a glass of water. [quiet sipping] Well, chin, chin. [quiet scraping continues] It won't be long now. Love. Yeah. Oh, I love you too. Love you. [soft rustling of fabric] [planchette scrapes] - Hi, Debs here. Debbie. Here I am, ready for some fun. No. Okay. Hi, I'm Debbie. This is a place we're house sitting for the next few weeks. Sorry about these. Sorry, I just haven't had much chance to clear anything away. [bowls and tools rattle] There we go. Right. So, this is my knitting kit. I know it must seem lame, but, I think they're pretty awesome. Okay. This is when we are staying. Okay. Here come stairs. We have ... Bathroom. [door opens] [light switch flips] There's not much to say, really. Okay. [door closes heavily] So, the front room. Lovely, and then, carry on. We've got [door clicks open] the guest bedroom. Sometimes I sleep in here. Only when Henry's snoring too much. He does that when he's been drinking. [door slams shut] And then, alright, just look at the view. What I wake up to sometimes. So happy with it. [door clicks] Hey. How was your day? [Henry grunts in reply] [light switches on, refrigerator opens] [bottles clank] [refrigerator closes] [bottle fizzes, metallic clanking] - What are you doing? Gimme that thing. Oh, look at my wife. Her gorgeous tits. What's for dinner? - Shepherd's pie. - Fucking again? - What, I thought we'd just use what was left over. - Wonder if all this film isn't distracting from cooking and cleaning. - And that's my husband, Henry. I love him. I do. He's had a long day and he gets tired. - Debbie. Here, now. [Debbie sniffling] - So. This is something that happens on regular basis. Sadly not anything paranormal. [Debbie weeps pitifully] - [Debbie] This just happened. Literally just flew off the side. Spooky. So, it was in pieces all over the floor. So I ran to get the - - You just dropped it, you clumsy cow. - No, it flew off the side. - Did you get it on camera? - Oh no. It happened before. I had to go. - Then, how is me or anyone else supposed to believe you? - Well, I guess, okay, you're right. - One fucking plate smashes. And you think it's fucking Casper. [plate crashes onto the table] The fucking hell, where did that come from? - I don't know, I was filming you. - Was that, are you playing games? - No. - What the fuck? [table slamming] Don't fucking play games with me. - I'm not, I'm not. I'm not. - Gimme that phone. [loud thumping] [belt buckle rattling] [loud smacking noise] [Henry grunting, Debbie crying] [continued grunting and heavy breathing] [Henry grunts, dishware rattles and clanks] [Debbie whimpers] [heavy breathing] [belt buckle rattles] - So, after Henry finished with me, something kind of weird happened. I couldn't film, it happened way too quick, like the plate. But I heard someone whisper to me and it said, everything's going to be okay. [muffled raindrops] Wonder how the others are getting on. Look. [Debbie hums quietly] [distant chirping of birds] I do love this place. Even in the rain. [Debbie laughs softly] [rain, birds chirping] [Debbie] I heard it again in here. [breathing heavily] Okay. [door clicks shut] I think, if I keep the camera rolling, hopefully I will catch something. [startled inhale] Come on, come on, come on. I'll keep the, I'll keep the camera with me and hopefully I will catch something if and when it happens. [plate clatters] - Do you have to film me every time I'm eating? - [Debbie] Please. Like, it's easier for me to talk to you than the phone. - Fine. What did it say? - Well, it was like a whisper. I couldn't really tell. - Then why the fuck are you even telling me about it? It's probably just the wind. - Yeah, you're probably right. - Just like the plate. - Oh, the plate was the wind. - I watched the footage and it wasn't a ghost. Ooh, Paul's coming over tonight to watch the footy. So go and smarten yourself up, alright? - Oh, is he? Okay. - I told you last week. - Sorry. No, it must have slipped my mind. - Well, a lot of things are slipping your mind lately, aren't they? - I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm so ditzy. - It's this video project that's taken over. - Oh, it's only for a few more weeks. - Thank fuck. Can't wait for it to be over. [soft slap] [football crowd cheering wildly on television] - [Henry] Paul. [Paul laughs] - Hey Paul. [beer bottles clink] - You're such a knob. - Ooh. [Paul laughs] [camera fuzzes and drops] - [Debbie] Please be careful, Henry. - [Henry] Right, we're only having a laugh. [loud patting noise] Come sit down. [crowd continues cheering] Sit back properly. I think she's scared of me or something. [Paul laughs] Oh, give us that. - So, Henry was saying that you're in an experiment. - Yeah. - Well? - [Henry] Tell Paul all about it. - Well, it's complicated. - [Henry] No, it's not. She's been communicating with dead people. [both men laughing] - That's fucking mental. What, like a Ouija board or something? - No, not like a Ouija board, it's not - - [Henry] It's exactly a Ouija board. And now she freaks out everything that happens in the house. It's fucking hilarious. - What have you seen, Debs? - It's Debbie. - [Henry] Hey, don't be rude. He was asking you a question. - Sorry. No, I haven't seen anything yet. - Well, you're totally mad if you did actually see something. Anyway, gonna go take a slash. - [Henry] Grab me another one of these on the way back. [football audience cheers] You're being fucking rude. - Sorry. I'm just tired. - [Henry] I think I'm gonna lose again. - Hope not. Why are you still filming me? - [Henry] Because you are beautiful. - Thanks. - [Henry] Paul's taking his sweet time. [yelling] You're having a shit, mate, or a wank? Hold this. - [Debbie] Oh, Henry. No, you don't have to film that. - [Henry] Why not? It'll be funny. [heavy tap on the door, door clicking] - [Paul] What's going on? - [Henry] Paul. - [Paul] I'm trying to. Let me out. [camera fuzzes and distorts] - [Henry] What're you doing, mate? What the, the fuck's going on? - I couldn't fucking get out. - What do you mean you couldn't get out? Don't make song and dance about it, mate. It's a tricky door. - You saw it. It wouldn't let me leave. - It would, the door wouldn't let you leave? No, the, I don't, mate, just forget it. I'm gonna go. - Now, what are you talking about? You're not making any sense. - I'll see you at work tomorrow. - What the fuck? What the fuck is he talking about? Fucking door. What's he talking about? What's going on? - [Debbie] Henry? What's happening in there? - [Henry] Fucking - oh. - [Debbie] Henry, what's happening in there? - Absolutely fucking nothing. [softly blowing air] [Debbie sucks air in through her teeth] - How can he fucking blame me for what happened to his stupid friend? I'm sick of this. Every time something goes wrong, I get the fucking blame. I just want him to stop. [camera settling] Okay, so, I've been reading about how to appease spirits because I've been thinking maybe this isn't a bad thing, you know, maybe it's not like an evil monster. Maybe it's, I don't know, like an angel. I know it must sound stupid, but, kind of feel safer when it's here. So, I did my reading, and I've got some candles, and, I don't know, it could work. [door opens suddenly] - Goin' on in here? - I thought you'd be back later. - The car wouldn't start. Have you made a fucking shrine for these spirits? - Do you believe me now, then? - Don't fucking answer back. Why have you made a shrine after what happened to Paul last night? What the fuck? - You try to keep them happy. - Happy, we wanna get rid of them. - Well, we could call an exorcist. - Don't fucking laugh. It's not funny. This is your fault, you know. - Can't blame me for this. - Oh yeah? - No! [Debbie screams and cowers] - Okay, so, after Henry attacked me, something crazy happened. It's definitely an angel. - [Henry] Fucking help me. [doorknob slowly turns] [Henry groaning in pain] Stop filming. What are you doing? [loud groaning and wincing] - So sorry this happened to you. - God, you really - well, stop filming then. - No. Listen, Henry. I'm, I'm really worried. I just, I need to get the evidence. - First thing in the morning, we're calling a fucking Ghostbuster or something. [Henry wincing in pain] - I don't think we need to do that, Henry. - Ah, look, I've seen enough horror films, alright, to know that this just doesn't end, alright? [groaning] Ah, why'd I let you do this? - You don't think it was real? - I still don't, but I'm not taking any chances. How much have you been filming anyway? - What do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean. - I've been, I've only been filming when something strange happens. - Really? [plastic and metal rattling] - So ... I think I might leave him. I don't know. I just. I feel like I deserve better. I don't know. I just. Yeah, I just wanna feel loved. [Debbie sniffles] I don't wanna be afraid anymore. I don't want to be afraid anymore. I don't want be afraid anymore. [silence] [camera rattling] My name is Debbie Smith, and I've been a victim of domestic violence for the last five years. I don't know how it started or when it'll end, but I can't do this anymore. I need help. [odd deep noise] Everything's going to be fine. I know it is. - [Henry] What happened today then? - Nothing much, really. - [Henry] Nothing? Nothing weird, strange. Just all normal, is it? - Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine tonight. - [Henry] Do you think so? Because I don't. Should I have a look at what you've been filming? - I don't think you need to do that. - [Henry] Why? Something you don't want me to see? - No, not at all, look. I just think that you should rest more. [fabric rustling] - [Henry] Yeah? - Don't worry about me and the silly video. Look, how about I get you another beer or maybe - New tattoo? - No, it's just some grease. [rustling fabric] [rustling and jostling] - Okay. Something strange just happened. I can't fully explain it, but, there was something standing above Henry. It was, it was like this big black mass. I mean, Henry was rolling back and forth. Looked like he was in pain. But, I mean, I'm fine. I don't know who, whether I should be worried about that. [door slowly opens] - Turn that fucking camera off. [door closes] - Oh, shit. Sorry. Just didn't see you there. Why are you filming? - There's only a few more days left. If you're a little prompted, isn't there, so I thought I'd see if I can help you get some footage. - Oh. Well, thanks. I suppose. - Sit down. I wanna show you something. - [Debbie on TV] My name is Debbie Smith, and I've been a victim of domestic violence for the last five years. - [Debbie] Henry, please. Can we turn this off? - [Debbie on TV] I dunno how it started, - [Debbie] Let's talk about this, please. - [Debbie on TV] or when it will end, but, - [Debbie] Henry. - [Debbie on TV] I can't do this anymore. I need help. - [Debbie] Henry, please just let me explain, okay? [Henry hums disapprovingly] - You're gonna show that to the police, were you? [mockingly] 'Oh, help me, help me. My husband's so abusive. Oh, he beats me up. Always so nasty.' - No, I wouldn't do that to you, Henry, 'I'm a victim, I'm a victim.' - [Debbie] I wouldn't do that to you. [heavy impact] [Debbie chokes and gasps in shock] [Debbie sobbing and breathing laboriously] [Debbie grasps at the mattress] [Henry exclaims, startled] [camera rattles and thumps] [Debbie gasping in pain] [Henry choking] [Henry exclaims] [Henry tumbling to the ground] [Debbie breathing unsteadily] [sharp inhale] - Oh my God. Oh my God. [panicked breathing and sobbing] - What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? My name is Debbie Smith, and I've been a victim of domestic violence for the last five years. [clears throat] - Hello, my name is Rebecca Air. I'm 25 years old, and I'm currently studying for my Master's in psychology. For my final project, I am going to conduct an experiment into the effects of participants who have taken part in a Ouija board session. I have chosen five different participants from very different backgrounds in the hope that the ramifications can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Do I believe in ghosts, demons, gods? No. But I do know what it's like to come from a family that deeply believes, and to dictate their own moral attitudes due to what a higher being says. I've arranged for each of the participants to have access to a camera, and they will document the month following the Ouija session. I will also be one of those participants. Heya. - [Timophy] Hi. [quiet steps] [metallic clang] - How's it going? - I'd say it went pretty well. There was four very different participants. Range of ages, sexes. - Good. It started then? - Yeah, well, why else would I be filming right now? - Ah, well, you know, try and keep the camera on the experiment, are you, darling? - Well, you never know what the camera might see. - Yes, exactly. Quite. Anyway, you have plenty of time with the camera tomorrow. Cause I've gotta see David. - And Fiona. - Yes, and Fiona. - She still hate me? - I'm afraid so, yes. - Well, I guess I deserve it. - Don't be ridiculous. Anyway, I'm gonna freshen up. I have a good feeling about your current work. - Really? - I can see you passing. [Rebecca laughs] - Oh wow, a pass. Just what I've always wanted. - Oh, sarcasm. I think you've a lot of vulnerable people here who'll deliver on what you want. That's an eclectic list of misfits. - Well, I wouldn't say misfits. - But you can pretty much guarantee a response from them. - Well, that's why I choose them. - You're a little genius. [Rebecca and Timophy kissing] [giggling] - Yeah, I'll be there. No, Timophy won't be there. You made it quite clear last time. Look, Mom, I don't have the time or the energy to argue with you right now, okay? I just, I just wanna say goodbye to Dad. No, no need to pick me up. Tim said he'll, he'll give me a lift. He's happy to. Just try and say one thing nice about him, hey? Yeah. Okay. Okay, bye. Have a good, have a good day. Something that I'm yet to admit. So my father recently passed away. I don't think it will affect the experiment, but I just feel that I should be honest about it. I've just spoken to some of the participants and it seems we're off a really positive start. I really didn't expect them to start hallucinating so quickly. I have to say, I've, I've been tempted to use the Ouija board to contact my dad, but, in doing that, I'd be my own patsy, right? - So, would you say it's been a success? - Would you? - Well, from what you've talked to me about so far, only the two most vulnerable people are really reacting. - Exactly. [Timophy laughs] - Then, bravo. [wine glasses clink, laughter] Are you really gonna be filming everything? - Well, not everything. - Yes, I mean, but, I really don't think we should be filming everything, should we? - You didn't mind at the start! - I know, but I've, I've had a change of heart. I think you'd just be a bit more, less sensible. - Well, I'm not gonna use any of that footage, am I? - Well, still, I just think it'd be better to be a bit more careful. - What do you think I'd do with the footage? - I know, it's just that I don't want to upset you or anything, but, you know, this isn't the first time I've done this. - Yeah. You've slept around your students before. - So, why I need to be sensitive to the situation, you know? - I'm not gonna share it. Why would I do that? - No, I, I didn't mean, I didn't mean that. It's just, look, I, I can't do this. - Please, tell me what you think I'm gonna do with the footage. - I'm not saying that. - Look, Timophy, you told me that you were drinking. - Then don't - Alright, alright, alright. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, I didn't, I wasn't trying to be rude to you. I'm sorry. It's just, I'm stressed. - Okay. Just wanted some support. - Yeah. Okay. Forgive me. - Some very interesting footage has come over. What? I'm starting to think, maybe it's the effect of energy. Like perhaps the participant's vulnerability and their negative environments are creating a physical force. I haven't quite reached the stage of accepting that it's a poltergeist yet. My own footage has been minimal. If anything, it's just showcasing how much of a dick Timothy can be. But, there is this clip. But it could have been Timothy moving around during the argument, but, I'm confident it can't be him. I'm, I'm not stupid. I know the mind plays tricks constantly, but there's something about the shadow. It seems familiar. [Rebecca] Okay, so this just came in the post. It's a box of chocolates and a card addressed to me, but there's nothing in the card. It's not just any chocolates. It's my dad's favorites chocolates actually. Yeah, so, it's a bit weird. I mean, I don't think there's anyone playing a prank. I mean, what would be the point in that? But yeah. Anyway, I'm going to review the footage and see if there's anything I might have missed. Okay. This figure has been in nearly every shot. How the hell did I miss this? I think something's happening. - [Timophy] Hello? - [Rebecca] I'm in here. - [Timophy] Kid, you've been busy. - [Rebecca] I think something's happening. - [Timophy] Happening? - [Rebecca] I, I caught something on camera. - [Timophy] What do you mean? - [Rebecca] Look. - [Timophy] I don't see anything. - [Rebecca] What, what about these? - [Timophy] I think that's just a reflection of me, isn't it? - [Rebecca] There's definitely something in these photographs. Look at that space there. - [Timophy] Oh, really, I can't see anything. We're not supposed to be looking for ghosts here, you know, Rebecca? - [Rebecca] I, I'm sure something is, is happening. I, I can't explain this. - [Timophy] But I can. You, you're getting wrapped up in the experiment. You've seen how some of these vulnerable people have been influenced by this. - [Rebecca] I don't know. This, this isn't normal. Something more to it. I, I don't know. - Look, I, I suspect you're feeling vulnerable with the, the funeral so soon. - [Rebecca] Wait. Wait. There was something else. [plastic crinkles] - Well, what's this? - [Rebecca] What came in the post. - Chocolates? - [Rebecca] Yeah, but my dad's favorite. - Someone's sending you chocolates to my house. - [Rebecca] Isn't this our house? - Yes. What did I say? - [Rebecca] Look, it doesn't matter. I, I just feel that something's happening. I'm not saying it's ghosts, but this isn't normal. - But it is. Rebecca, you've seen what's happened to your participants where they're vulnerable. They're starting to believe these things themselves. And now you are. Look, maybe it's best to end the experiment. - [Rebecca] How is that the best thing to do? I'm, I'm getting real results. - No, you, you are, you are seeing how, how people are being affected. We're getting mass hysteria here. You've seen how the other people have been affected. Now you are. You can collect your data. You've got information. End it. - [Rebecca] Good thing you don't teach me anymore. - That's a low blow. - [Rebecca] Oh, is it? I'm getting something that could be real proof. And you patronize me. - I'm trying to keep you focused. Look, this is what happens with your participants. They're vulnerable. And, and maybe you are a little bit at the moment as well. Look, I don't wanna have an argument about all this, this stupid experiment. Maybe I'll just go out for a bit. - [Rebecca] You don't need to leave. Look, we can talk this through. - Look, no, I, I'll, I just need a drink. - [Rebecca] Please. I don't wanna be alone on this. - Well, I just need a drink alone, okay? - [Rebecca] Isn't that how you met me? [feet stomping] We had a big argument and Timophy made it clear that he doesn't want me to keep going with the experiment. I've gotta see it through. I really feel like I'm onto something and, I dunno, I, I feel like something's trying to connect with me. I want to see what happens next. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna continue with the experiment. [clasp unlocking] [jewelry clattering] [glasses snapping] [rough coughing] Hello? [coughing continues] [coughing grows louder] [camera microphone buzzes and distorts] [strange, loud, distorted coughing] Dad? [Rebecca] I dunno what happened to the camera. I really hope it caught. I hope it caught that he was here. He was right here. It was my dad. He was here. I saw him. [Rebecca breathing shakily] I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't just a picture, I - After you keep, I'm gonna keep going with this. Is there a spirit here with me now? [planchette softly moves] Do I know the spirit? [soft scraping] [door closes] Dad? Is it you? [feet stamping] - What are you doing? - Nothing. - It looks like you've lost your mind a bit. - I'm not the one who's just come home at 10:00 AM still drunk. - So what? I was wrong. It is my home. I don't need all this going on here. I had it all with Fiona. I don't need it with you as well, Rebecca. - Sorry. - Is that a Ouija board on my floor? - I saw him. - Who? - My dad. He was sitting right there. - Well, he's dead, okay? - That's fucking cold. - I'm sorry. I don't care anymore. It, it's just, I need this experiment over. - What am I supposed to do? Document it in the street? - I don't care. I just need it gone, out of my house. - Don't you mean me? - What? - Don't you mean you want me out of the the house? - Well, right now it wouldn't hurt, I don't think. - You fucking pig. - No, it, it's gone too far. I just don't need this going on, what with your, the funeral and the experiment. It's all got too much. - I'm sorry. This is what happens when you are in a relationship and not just fucking every classmate. [mysterious coughing starts up again] - Just go, please. - Did you hear that? - What? - I heard him. - No, this is just getting ridiculous. No more, alright? If you won't leave, then I will. But, but you can pack up and, and, and get out by the time I've got back, okay? - I, I thought you just said that we needed a break, I - - Just, just go, alright? - Tim. Timophy! I, I don't want to hear that you were right right now, mom, okay? I just, I need to know that I can come and stay for a little while. Because he's a drunk and he thinks that I'm crazy. - It's my experiment, I, I found something that I didn't expect. And look, mom, can we just, can we just talk about it when I'm home, please? Please, Mom, I, I saw dad, okay? [coughing starts again] Hello? Hello? [exhaling in frustration] - [Rebecca's Dad] Rebecca? [Rebecca whimpers] Rebecca? Rebecca? Oh. [fuzzing distorted sounds] - [Rebecca] Dad! - Rebecca, sweetheart. - [Rebecca] This isn't real. - Oh, you're looking well. - [Rebecca] I never thought I'd have to see your face again. - Why is that? - [Rebecca] This isn't real. - Do I look real? Do I feel real? - [Rebecca] Please! I need you to get off of me! - Give your Dad a kiss. - [Rebecca] No! - Or maybe something stronger! - [Rebecca] No! You're not my dad! - Oh, you always said I was insufferable. - [Rebecca] You're dead! Somebody, help! - Don't you backtalk! You welcomed me in! [Rebecca straining for air] [Dad laughing] You were caught, and you always surprise me. [demonic whispering grows louder] [Rebecca wheezing] Is this what you wanted? - [Strange whisper] Is this what you wanted to see? [Rebecca gasps for air] [measured steps] [coughing] - [Timophy] Oh, so your stuff's all still here, is it? I thought I told you. Rebecca? Rebecca? Oh, no. What've you done? Rebecca! Ambulance. Ambulance, I need an ambulance now, quickly! Oh, God. [silence]
