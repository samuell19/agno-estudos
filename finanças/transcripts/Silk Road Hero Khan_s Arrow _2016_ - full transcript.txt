What our time needs are heroes. People who realize their dreams. Ning Zetao won the sprint swimming championship, and realized the dream of China and even Asia for a century. He is a hero at our age.

To be honest, I keep having the same dream lately. I dream about our hometown. HunLunbeier Grassland I also dream about Dun Huang. What secret do you think the bow and arrow passed down for generations have? I take them when I trade stocks. When I take it, I never lost a trade. I'm going to Mogao Grottos this time to look for an answer. Autumn of the year 22 in Kaiyuan Reign of the Tang Dynasty, Chang'an By the grace of God The emperor hereby declares Li Yu is gentle and humble charming and graceful beautiful and intelligent virtuous and chaste Hence is the number one choice for marriage. Announce her as the Princess of Yilan to permanently stable our borders. Sister, Dad is so cruel. Yes, he is. Don't leave us sister. Okay? Don't leave sister. Right. Don't leave. Sister Don't leave us. Alright? We don't belong to ourselves. We belong to the Kingdom of Tang. When you grow up, you'll understand. Before I leave, I'll dance one more time the Rainbow Skirt & Feathered Dress. Okay? Bring in the wine. Never let your cups dry. Let us shovel down the woes of thousands of years. One is the number one scholar, and the other is an extraordinary girl. They all live for the Kingdom of Tang. They are both good children of Tang. Yunfan, Are you okay? After the princess leaves, my heart leaves with her. I met her on the street. She dressed up. Like a pretty girl from a humble family. She was so beautiful and attractive. Who would've thought that she was the princess of Tang. She gave her romantic relationship to the Kingdom of Tang. I don't hate her. But I respect her. She left. And I'll leave Chang'an City too. To go with her. And be by her side even just to heard the sheep. The guy who recorded this story in history is the number one scholar name Xia Yunfan. The story happened in Kaiyuan reign of Yang Dynasty. The princess was getting married, and the best scholar went after her. It depicted a heroic and moving story happened along the silk road. In the northern grassland where trade route opened during the flouring time of Tang Dynasty, tribes were in constant wars against each other. After all kinds of hardships, the princess gave birth to his son Amuting. Run. Brother Look, brother We made it. You are great as an older brother. In front of death, you didn't run alone. You are a warrior. I'm the prince. Soon will be the heir. Then I'll become a warrior. I only have two sons, you and Amuting. If you want to be the heir, he's standing in your way. Why did you risk your life to save him? He is my little brother. And also your knife stone. Your highness, please. Your mislead my little brother into danger No Prophet will save you. Please your highness, Please Your highness Mama Mama Mama Mama Yunge Brother Ting What did you do wrong this time? I will plead for you. Yunge Mama, Mama Our little princess is cuter and cuter. Mama is the best Mama, Look what a poor guy he is. Please release him. Anyone who made a mistake will be punished. Mm The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it cannot be neglected. Master, If I practice well, will I be the number one when I grow up? As long as you learn and train hard, you will be the number one in the world. I will practice hard. But if you want to master the art of Kung Fu, you can't succeed without blood and sweat. Ah Get up Get up Try again. Remember If you want to master Kung Fu, you must subject your mind to suffering, and labor your muscles and bones. Go Try again I quit No you can't Go back Try it again Look at me Charge Ting went away to treat his injury. I want to thank you for saving Ting's life. I don't need you to thank me. When he comes back, let him thank me himself. Princess It's infuriating. His mama because of me was ignored by Wuzhate later was kidnapped by bandits But she died because Wuzhate didn't arrive in time to rescue her So he hates me Khan's arrow, passed down by grassland tribes ancestors, are tiger head shaped bow and arrow made with wolf skin. Legend has it that the owner of the bow and arrow can conquer the grassland and be the King Take it. What's the character Yan mean here? You'll understand later. Where Khan's arrow points is the direction where the force goes. Khan's arrow is the symbol of the King. Only the King of the grassland can have it. Now, I hand it over to you. Master, why do you always want me to be the King? I'm not good enough. My older brother is the King. He doesn't deserve to be. Take it. Is this really that powerful? I've witnessed it before with my own eyes. From now on till the day you become an adult, You will only come back to the Palace twice a month. But what if my dad wants to see me? You mama will handle it. What's your relationship with my mama? Well. Trot. Trot. I'm scared. Slow down. Trot. Mr. Prophet May the girl besides me be my future wife? The grace of God Shines upon the earth. She will be the King's woman. Thank you Mr. Prophet. Go. Let me go. I don't want to be the King's woman. It's not up to you. Whatever. Huh. Yunge. I think she's a little afraid of you. She might not be your woman. But you said she's the King's woman. You are not the King yet. Are you blaming me for saving my little brother? Appeasement brings disaster. We brothers almost got killed by wolves. So you planned all these. It's too soon to wipe out future troubles Without my order, you are not allowed to take unauthorized actions. Bravo Trot. Trot. Mama. Ting. Ting. This is such a beautiful horse. Can I ride it? Just for a moment. Alright. Come on. Mama we are going. Okay. Be careful. Well. Trot. Amuting is finally a grown man. He tamed the most bad-tempered horse on the grassland. Look at him galloping the grassland with Yunge, I seem to see the old Chang'an city the time when I met the Princess. Tort. Ting, will you become the King? Prophet says, I'll become the King's woman. If I can't be the King, will you still be my woman? Under the eyes of all tribes, second Prince Amuting is officially an adult. My royal family is adding another warrior. Congratulations your Majesty King Wuzhate. Congratulations Prince the second. Amuting, do you participate heir election? Mm If you give up heir election, you'll keep your Prince title, enjoy ten guards, be the chief of a small tribe. Stay away from the royal family. If you fail, you will become a civilian. Your men will be beheaded. Go home to prepare! Ting. Come here. Drink. Stop! Out of the way! Excuse me, we have a respected guest. The King ordered that no one shall disturb. Buzz off! Who dares to stop me. When I become the King, I'll chop off the head of each of yours and stick them on these stumps. While I lie in the golden tent, watching you everyday. Get lost! Stop! Father. Put your knife away. Go back to where you came from. Go! I don't understand. The throne is supposed to be mine, Why did you bring Amuting in? He is not legitimate. And even if he won the election, you should pass down the throne to me, not him. The throne is mine! Take him down! Father. Father. Wuzhate, you are like an eagle on this grassland. I've always admired you. Joining the royal family, shall wait until you appoint the heir. Let's discuss this matter later. I shall leave you Father, why did you bring him in? Prophet Wusa told me that I will be the King. Father. That's mine. If you keep talking nonsense, I will cut your hands. Take him away! It's mine! Father. The throne is mine! Why do you bring him in? Father Come on Ting. Have you all understood the rules of snatch the flag? Begin! Bravo Not bad. Nice Aketusa tribe, 900 kilometers from here, betrayed our family a year ago. Prophet says, they used to harass the passing merchants. They should've been wiped out, but since you guys are coming of age, this shall be my gift to you. Ting got the flag, and won the chance to set off a day earlier, besides the privilege to select warriors first. Both of you have 30 men. Whoever conquers Aketusa tribe first, will be my heir. The loser will be downgrade to civilian. And his 30 men all have to die. Please forgive me Prince On your knees! Your highness, we are about to go on a battle, Why get so angry? You are here prophet. Have a seat. I will be the Khan of the grassland. It's what the people want. But my father makes it so hard for me. He even wants me to compete with Amuting. So what? Are you afraid of him? Me? No I want to kill him. Prince, Your highness, I want to introduce someone to you. Why don't you come in and kneel down? Greetings your highness. Raise your head. It's you. Amuting's man Oh my princess, I, Xia Yunfan can't accept this. Yes, you can. Gentleman dies for those who appreciate them. In my whole life, you are the person I trust the most. On the way to the grassland, in order to protect me, you fought the bandits with your life, you lost your right arm, and you almost died. Now, I ask you to take care of Amuting/ I say it again, I'm willing to follow your highness wherever you are. Even though I'm crushed to pieces, I will not regret it. Amuting was born to be a King. He is protected by God. But don't worry your highness, I will use up all my strength to assist Amuting, to become the King and rule the world. Becoming the King is just the first step. Eliminate war with war, and return peace to the world in the end. This is God's mission for Amuting. Long You were looking for me? What's the matter? Yunge I don't have anything important. I just missed you. We'll talk later then. I have to go for something urgent. Yunge Where are you going? I Are you going to look for Amuting? Yes Why him? Don't you know how much I like you? You are out of your mind. Yes, I am. Let go of me Did you forget? Let go of me It's you who've forgot. You'll be the King's woman. And me Amulong I'll be the King Did you forget? Let me tell you something. You are not the King yet So Please be respectful Come on. Lock Yunge up! Without my order No one can let her out You As long as I don't give the order you'll be locked here for the rest of your life You Huh Amuting won a day to depart early Amuting won a day to depart early in snatch the flag match. Amulong confessed his love for Yunge before he set off but was rejected by her. Furious out of humiliation Amulong locked Yunge up in the camp Xia Yunfan passed by and saw it happen Will he rescue her? What will happen to Yunge? Get on! Let's go! Appeasement brings disaster. Even his men don't trust him. Don't worry. But he won in flag Snatch. Things change. You have to be cautious. This time it's different. It's killing. His men will hate him. They all think he'll lose. And to lose is to die. Hans have this saying that goes, an army burning with righteous indignation is bound to win. You are a wizard of Saman, you are prophet's man. Why are you following me? Because you are the Khan who will unite the grassland. Good It's good that you know. Trot I'm the King in the night of the grassland. Let the bothers kill each other, and make the grassland in chaos. And then I will control the trade route. Hahahaha Yunge Sh Follow me. Chief Don't get yourself in trouble. If you want to live, stay out of it. Say it I don't respect you. You don't disrespect me. You hold grudges against me. You hate me for picking you guys. You are afraid of being killed because of me. I'm glad you know. I want to challenge you to a duel. You are getting yourself killed. If you beat me and boost our confidence, then it's worth dying for me. Okay Challenge accepted. Ting What trick is he playing? This is Kung Fu from the Hans. On our grassland, one always win support of his people by Kung Fu. Ting will sure win. It won't be easy. No I have to help him. Hey. No, you can't. He has to convince people on his own. We can't only help him in the dark. From now on, you are the captain. Brother, you need to drink some water. Here you go. Take it. You are risking everybody's life. Damn it. Hey Don't say that. Maybe there are other reasons. No I have to kill that guy. Are you coming? Huh How do you think I should punish you? It doesn't matter. Can you tell me why you are saving this guy? You don't need to know. If you make another mistake, I will kill you. Get out! You are awake. Thank you for saving my life! My name is Kelitu. A merchant from Turpan My name is Amuting. You have enemies? I'm going back to my tribe to get married, but didn't think I'd be robbed. So what are you going to do next? I left my tribe a few year ago and I trained a bunch of holy mastiffs, I want to go find them. Are you Ready? Everything is ready. I go first with the troop. I hope your force of holy mastiffs, will meet us in time. I won't let you down. Trot Where is your chief? Where is your chief? Where is your chief? Who are you? I'm Ma name Cher We are being robbed. Please help us, I can pay for it. They'll come back tonight. Please save us. You have more people, you will beat them. Go find someone else, we have to go. Where are you going? We can help you too. We know the area. My dad has a map. We are looking for Aketusa tribe. We've been there before. We could save at least a day. I know a shortcut. Please trust me. This is where we are now. And this is the road you were going to take. I know a small path through the woods. Take this shortcut, and it'll take you to Aketusa tribe one day faster. Mm Let me in. I want to see the Prince. Let me in. Let him in. Your highness. Lakeshen, you didn't forget what you've promised me, huh Of course not. As long as you need me, I'll go through fire and water for you and I won't hesitate. This is half the reward. After you succeed, I'll give you the other half. And when I become the King of the grassland, I'll protect you. Thank you your highness! You guys tonight, are you staying in the camps of the merchants? Yes How are their troops deployed? Here, there are their troops everywhere. Mm Go hide somewhere. Dad Follow me. Lakeshen, go back with me to see the Prince. Don't even think about it. Go back with me to see the Prince. I said, if you make another mistake, I will kill you. What mistake did I make this time? You risk your life for a group of merchants, this is a shame for a warrior. This entire grassland belongs to our family, even the merchants are our people. Royal family, you can't represent the royal family. You are just a reckless Prince. You make so many people die for you. You are a coward! You, flying in the face of danger, are a coward. Rest assured Prince, the six injured warriors will be taken care of by Ma. Thank you. It's my pleasure. It'd be difficult if you are not familiar with the shortcut. Why not let Cher take you? Just in case. Sneak attack failed! Amuting Trot This is the secret passage. Trot Trot Mr. Prophet, what did you see? I saw killing. Killing? The one sitting on the throne. Who is? It's Amuting. Amuting? It's him again! You call me out in the middle of the night just to tell me these? Your highness, Amuting has taken the shortcut. If we don't come up with solutions, it'll really be too late. How did you know all the information? I'm a wizard. I always have means normal people don't have. Means? Of all the people in this tribe, who can be more resourceful than you? You helped my dad become the King, simply because you want my dad to allow you have your own power. Now you are helping me get the throne, do you want me to grant allow you to bully around too on the silk road? Since your highness are aware of everything, then I don't have anything to hide anymore. Wizard is just my disguise I help you become the King, because I hope in the future you won't expel and kill me. Mr. Prophet, don't you think that we two have more and more in common? Hahahahaha Look. Aketusa people Trot Tort. Ting Watch out! Yunge Yunge Ting went everywhere for days to get the antidote from the mountain spring, Merchants send hundred years old ginseng. Yunge should be fine after resting for a few days. But it makes Ting on edge, Please don't worry your highness. Our relationship with Aketusa tribe goes way back, I'll do my best to help Ting succeed. Cher Take care of her. I will. Zhana Yes? Your highness They told us everything. They are not from the Aketu tribe, but they are Wusa's people. Wusa? Yes We've wasted a day already, It'll be too late if we don't act now. Your highness, we are really running out of time. You get out. Please kill Zhana. Okay. Amuting, what are you doing? Put down your knife. Put down your knife. Back off. You are going to be the King, and you need to have the subtlety of being a King. Amuting, you should get on your feet. I'll take care of Yunge. She'll recover soon. Amuting, go complete your mission. You don't have much time left. It's my fault. I didn't train the troops well. People hand over their lives to my hands. But I brought you into despair. I apologize to you. From now on, we live or die together! We fight side by side till the end! Let's go! Trot There is the tribe of Aketu. How many people do they have? Over two hundred. People who can fight a war? About 80. 80? We only have 20. You guys are really going to kill them all? That's over two hundred lives. My dozens of merchants were killed all too. What if we lure them to surrender? I know their Prince Tulunuo. I've done business with him. He is a very bright young man. Him who doesn't kill wins the heart of people from afar. Go. Since we parted last time, I've been devoted to practicing sword skill. I've been waiting to show off to you. But unfortunately, Don't be sorry. Please. Your highness, I'm here to talk about something with you. Go ahead. Do you want to lead your tribe to live a life like fugitives? I don't want it to be like this, I was being emotional and stupid. Now there's no turning back. Have you ever thought about Solving this problem by reconciliation? I have a friend that I want to introduce to you. I don't want to see killing among tribes. But my dad won't give up easily. A year ago, our merchant caravan got robbed by bandits. Royal army didn't save us. Dad was furious and left the royal family. If your dad is willing to come back, see the King with me and apologize for his betrayal last year. Although someone is trying to set him up, as long as your father explains in person, I'll make sure your tribe is safe. The only person my dad trusts is the wizard on the grassland, Dunmuer. If he can put in a few good words, My dad will agree for sure. Dunmuer? Tell your dad to get ready to greet him. Follow the steps of the King, achieve the supreme glory. Obey rigorously the order of the Prophet, Servant Surile here to see you. You are Dunmuer. When you were born, I was wandering on this grassland, learned some medicine and witchcraft. It's been ten years this year, I have had some success. All these years, I've got some disciples. They will definitely give you some help. The holy mastiff has found Amulong's troops. They are half a day's trip from us. I'll ask Zhana to talk to my dad right away. Aketu tribe has returned to our royal family. Trot My Aketu tribe here, to offer the divine artifact ox horn from our ancestors, to show our allegiance. Me, Amuting promise to keep your tribe safe. Kill! Don't miss one! Kill them all! Kill them all! Whoever is in my way, dies! Aketu has submit and returned. Why are you still killing? He returned to you, not me. It doesn't concern me. Let's go! Dad Dad Dad Dad We've agreed, you protect my tribe. But now, my dad and my tribe are all dead. Dad, Your child is coming with you. Cheers. Prince, Congratulations! You killed Surile in your own hand, It greatly increased your authority in the army. Counselor Wusa, You said I'm the King of the Grassland. It means me Amulong will soon be the King. Cheers Let's drink. As long as the second Prince lives for a day, the throne is hanging in the air. Unless. Prophet, Amuting is a loser. If I kill him, it's too easy for him. I want him to see in his own eyes, Yunge and I get married. Come on, dance. Cheers. Drink. Master, I want to be the King. Please help me, Why be the King? To unite the grassland. Now, you've failed. If you want to be the King, you have to rise up. Do you want to betray the royal family? Only war can eliminate ruthless killing. Master, If I don't become the King, I cannot protect the people of the grassland for generations to come. There'll never be peace for the merchants. That'll be my failure, and the failure of my royal family. So I have to be the King. Good boy! Nicely put! Cheers! Khan's arrow will help you become the King. Amuting has finally overcome his own weakness, and grown into a real hero. The fearless robust Khan's arrow helped him quell the wars on the grassland. Listen you all! We have not yet failed, so you won't be executed. If you still want to follow me and fight alongside me, we'll take back the pride and credit that belong to us. Father, Goodbye. Father, I have defeated Aketusa tribe. May I ask dad when will we hold the announcement ceremony? The timing shall not be determined by you. Father, please keep your word. When did I break my word? Father, you are getting older and shouldn't worry about issues like these. Why don't you hand them over to me? Wouldn't it be nice? Disrespectful! All my warriors are standing outside of your camp, ready to hold the announcement ceremony for me. You dare to threaten me? Take him down! Bastard! Are they all disciples of the Master's? They aren't my disciples. They are Khan's arrow's soldiers. Years ago, Yinyan went through so much trouble the best horse riders, and form the team after rigorous trainings. That explains the character Yan on the bow. Thinking back on those old days, Khan's arrow's troop was fierce winning every battle! People were frighten of them! Too bad Yinyan got killed. The army was struck apart. Year after year, the story has become a legend on this grassland. Master, how did you find them? They found you Found me? You are Khan's arrow and Khan's arrow is you Master, then who is Yinyan? Mama Come Kowtow to your father. Yinyan? Mama's name was Liyu, princess of Tang through marriage for peace. I married your father, Yinyan. Mama What about Nawuzhate? He was just your father's right hand, his brother. He followed your father and conquered a lot of tribes. As the royal family grew stronger, his ambition grew bigger and bigger. After I married your father, Wuzhate got resentful. He rose up when I was pregnant with you. So I had to submit to Wuzhate. Support you grow up. The Khan's arrow in your hand was kept in secret after your father was killed by Yunge's father, your dad's most loyal man. When you grow up, your master will pass it down to you. Amulong is killing innocent people. Whether to save the people of the kingdom and change the fate for the merchants, You choose. Ting, my son, Ting. I'm not your son. I'm Yinyan's son. Take it. I know. You know? Then why didn't you kill me? You know but why do you treat me like your own son? Because I I did your dad wrong Yinyan. It was the biggest mistake in my life. Ting, Do it. If I die in your hands, I'll be in peace. Ting Do it Ting. Dear God! Please grant Amulong the throne! People of the kingdom, Wuzhate was summoned by God to serve the God in heaven. Me Amulong, following God's will, is becoming the new owner of the kingdom. I'll lead chiefs of all tribes, wipe out all riotous tribes, carrying out God's will. All Chiefs, follow God's order. Amuting, ever since Aketusa tribe went down, I couldn't find you anywhere. To my surprise you have gathered all the riotous tribes to rise up against me. I'm the King now. Can't you see? You are the rebel You assassin our father, killing our people, conspire with Wusa to disorder the trade road. You don't deserve to be King. Shut up! I'm the King I'm the King. Father asked me why did I save you from the wolves? I told him you are my little brother, and you are the knife stone of my life. I'm letting you know today. If I could save you before I can kill you now. Kill me, and you are the King! Kill me! You can't catch me. Come on. I'm finally free. You were right. I was blinded by evil Wusa. He played me off against you since we were kids. He is our mutual enemy. You have to be the real hero on this grassland. Ting, will you become the King? After Amulong was wounded, he was suddenly lifted from the spell casted by Wusa. From then on, he stayed in the dark for the rest of his life to help Amuting maintain the peace of the trade road, and he asked me to keep this a secret. Greet our mighty King of the grassland! Amuting and Yunge held a grand wedding ceremony. Wars among tribes finally reside. Amuting announces that he'll only have one lover Yunge in his whole life. Congratulations your Majesty! After all these years, Ting has become a wise ruler on the grassland, Which restored its peace and harmony. Merchant caravans from other tribes can cross the trade road safely. And all of these are attributed to you. They should be attributed to Ting's effort, to all the effort from all the tribes. It's time to leave here. I'm keeping the story inside the Dunhuang Grottos, I believe future generations will see the heroes on the trade road of the grassland. Only great love can fulfill yourself and leave a beautiful life in history. A long time ago, a beautiful princess from the grassland after her lover died in the battlefield, came her maid to the imperial tree to recite the scriptures and worship Buddha. She reminds me of Yilan Princess and Xia Yunfan, Yunge and Amuting. They are all heroes. This one thousand seven hundred years old tree, the tall imperial Tree witnesses the sorrow and happiness in the world. I will keep looking. Looking for heroes, looking for dreams, for self salvation.
