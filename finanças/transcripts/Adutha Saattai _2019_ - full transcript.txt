Commute by public transport to college. This is also a lesson. -Sir! Are you afraid? Don't be afraid. From Pre KG to College, you send kids in the van like broiler chickens. How will she face this society in life, tomorrow? She must get used. Be seated. -You can leave. Bye, sir. -Okay. Okay, but why these nick names? It's because of frowning, sir. You rejoice at teasing the 'power'. The 'power' has no loss because of it. You must understand it. Responsibility is a two-way path. What if they aren't perfect? You behave perfectly and ask them queries. Asking them queries? Sir, even though dull in studies, they'll give the marks. But, when question them, they'll revenge us in practical marks.

Understand? -Go... This thread will save us, understand? -Okay, brother. Sir...sir... Give your hand. -For what, sir? You belong to our clan, right? -Our clan? Yes, tie this thread. What's this thread? Caste thread. Sir, it has been seven years since I got a certificate... ...that I'm a non-caste and non-religious person. Sir, it took long haul to know what caste you were, seven years ago. Give me your hand. I might yell you, go sir. Go... Don't want? Okay. Sir, have they got the thread to you too? Not only in our college, It's the stance in 90% of the colleges in Tamil Nadu. Our college stands first in everything, including this too. No, sir. It's very sad when people who should condemn, is wearing the thread. These people can't be changed. Look at your work, sir. Sir, we can't correct them. But, can correct the students. They should remove the thread by themselves. First, they must be united. It's tough. Let's try. Come on. O.Thenmozhi. -Sir. Your marks are bitter.. Does your dad educate you to show off in the wedding invitation? No need of it. Better, tell your dad to find a bridegroom for you. Take it. S.Palani Muthu. It's not enough. Still I expect more from you. Don't get distracted and save this father's name. Okay. Pothumponnu. These marks aren't enough. Look me, can I become the Principal overnight? Not rolling anywhere, take me as a role model and work hard. Okay? -Okay, sir. Muthu lakshmi. -Sir. How is it possible? There is no chance for you to score high marks. You've copied, right? Words are written with gaps. Study and write, next time. S. Arun. Him? I must do meditation for three minutes to just look at him. What's this mark? Useless. Already, you've many arrear papers. Your caste won't support studies. Why are you staring? Go out. I say, get out. A bad reputation to the college because of you. Go... Go... Sir, this is unfair. We need to talk about the future, not the past. He left the college, when scolded for low marks, caste etc... Though searched for him, we couldn't find. Sir, coffee. Thanks. -Sir! Take coffee. Thanks. If you say he is an useless, he'll be so. If we encourage him, he'll manage to come up. Everyone just looks at the score of the students. Not as a fellow man. The system is wrong. Is he giving me trouble, changing the system? I can't leave him as he wish. Am I extracting milk? I'm the Principal. He says you're brainless. Is that what he says or do you say? I'm the Vice-Principal. Why should I lie? Yes, you won't. Is he saying so? He says everything about you, frankly. He has grown tall and giving sorrow. Gopal. -Yeah, going sir. You can go down. - Okay, sir. Look sir, if we say a work, he won't heed us. He runs away in fear, when the Principal said. He is not running in fear. It's friendship. The friendship of the Principal and the peon still remains as a secret. The first job to do after becoming the Principal is... ...to open the secret. Sir, Principal meeting? -Yes, mam. I thought you'll get a call, when you were talking about him, on that day. I told the fact. -Go, he'll be waiting. Okay. Somehow, the issue must blow up and reach the Correspondent. He must be expelled and I should be the Principal. Yes, I said, So what? Was there any code of conduct not to talk so? Can we implement rules for it? This is why, I told when constructing the college... ...not to let the Department of Tamil. They'll speak grammar with 247 letters. But, our language is just compact, 26 letters. It's flying to London and Paris. But, your language is struggling in Tamil Nadu. It hasn't been three months since you came. Gopal! -Sir. Leave the dog. -Okay, sir. It has stopped. You carry on. Do you mean, I'm a dog? Flip the word. It's g-o-d, 'god'. I'm the god of this college. Ruling god! Let you be the god, sir. I'll stay. I won't go. Still, I've two years. You stay for twenty years. Why are you tormenting the students? They're dying when humiliated before other students. Let them die. What is he going to do being alive? Waste to home and to the nation. Sir, it's not good if I stay over here. Do you understand? It's not good for you. Why is your girlfriend named as 'Pothum ponnu'? She was named after the last of the five women born in their home. Good! Hey, your girlfriend is coming. Oh, god! What an explanation. Damn it. I thought of studying for the exam. But, I can't. I'm trying for one and half a year. She won't even look back. Hey...hmm... Do you know how many times she has seen you? So far, 16 times. Really? -Really. Don't talk about it, anymore. I'll talk to her and clear off. Are you serious? Am I telling lie, then? As you said, I've to discuss with her on phone. But, no balance in the phone. So I've to... Hey, take it. Recharge now I can do it, later. First, I must collect the relevant evidence. Evidence? What to do for that? Just a minute. Technology will help us, ever. Take a beautiful selfie when she comes near. Take it. Enough, let me see. When did he come in? Okay, she came. Reduce the tension. Don't be afraid of the examinations. Let's manage. Nothing to me. But, I'll be questioned at home. Even he shouldn't be in the photo. Why are they staring us? When did they say the reason? Always staring us. We belong to same college and classmates too. But, it's like we're in India and Pakistan. Damn it. Take it. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Yesterday, I came to the store with my sister. Oh, is it? "I was awaiting him coming on white pigeons" "He came and I was on the silvery white moon" Hi. "What a beautiful face for him" "The night bears his innerness" "The flower has his mind" "Come across, I'm your angel" "Unquenched thirst" "Love-which doesn't know to age" "The lust flowes in the body" "They're eternal, doesn't know to die" "I was awaiting him coming on white pigeons" "He came and I was on the silvery white moon" How is it going on? I came from Srilanka with great interest to study in Tamil Nadu. But, I fear I might discontinue. Why? If you put 2/cos?, you won't get the answer. That's why, I'm telling. Shruti. Come here. Why are you talking with him? -Sir! Asked him a doubt, sir. If you've doubt, ask the Professor. If you befriend with Dileepan, he'll do something. Be careful. Okay, sir. Okay, go to the classroom. -Okay, sir. Sir, just a minute. Tell me. He is a dangerous guy. Don't be friendly with him. Mr. Azhagiya Tamil Manavalan. How many days will you stay away from your family? Not even one day. They left their native land, separated from dear ones... ...and scattered in each and every direction. Don't know when they'll see each other. This is his primordial land. Where will he go if you chase him away? We cannot even provide medical aid to the mother. We sent her back. But...we can say with pride. Go, sir. -Sorry, sir. Dude, the war is not only in your place of birth but also here. There are such men, everywhere. You've to thump them and move on. Understood? Yes, sir. -Go. Aadhi, get up. Why didn't you come, yesterday? You'd have told me, if you want to take leave. Did he tell me, if he takes leave? Hey, what did he say? Nothing, sir. Tell me. -Nothing, sir. Except you both, others can leave. Thank you, sir. Go soon. Hey, you go out. What did he say? Tell me, what did he say? Dude, why are you standing out? Sir, he made me to stand for past one hour. Why? -Tell me. For taking leave, yesterday. What did he say? Tell me. 'Did he tell me, if he takes leave'? Did he say so? How arrogant are you all... -Sir. Sir, just a minute. Please. Come. Give him water. Take it. Sir, why are you punishing yourself thinking he is being punished? Don't need so much pressure. Are you advising me, Mr.Dayalan? No, sir. Sorry, sir. I shouldn't have said that. I was bit upset. That's why... -What's that? Why are you upset? I was upset because of you. Sir, just a minute. What's the problem? Yesterday morning, when coming to the college... Thenmozhi. Dad. Take it. -Give me, dad. Dad! -Dad! What happened? He got paralysis attack because of high blood pressure. Promptly, admit him in the bed. No need to help others in their hardships. But, even it's enough to heed. That'll be comforted. Sir! Where? Here. Sister! Sir, dad. -Sir, greetings. My sir. No, you lay down. Take it. Are you two children? My younger sister is in home, sir. Sir, if you take proper physiotherapy and good diet, you'll be back to normal. Don't cry. Recovering from pain is not important. The key is to win from it's impact. If you both recover, you can take care of him, safely. Okay? Take this for expenses. It's okay, sir. Keep it. Won't you get if your brother gives? Sir, dad took care of us by his job. Don't know what are we going to do? Tell me, whatever you need. I'm with you. Be bold. Come on. We've to face everything. Okay, sir. -Mam! Greetings! Why are you here? Just came to visit Aadhi's dad. Okay, go. Aadhi, take her. -Come, mam. What happened to these students, asking more doubts, today? Mam! A small doubt. -What's the doubt? Today, you'll ask in the corridor. Tomorrow you might ask on the road. And will you come home and ask? Whatever the doubt is, you must ask in the classroom. Understand? Move away, first. Don't stroke, be careful. What happened, mam? What? -I asked her a doubt. What's the doubt? -I know what's it. It's an old doubt. Come. Sir is coming. Greetings, sir. -Greetings! Move away. -Be seated. Sir, it's not your session now. Won't you give me two minutes? Take it, generously sir. -Be seated. What's your doubt? Sir, that is... I said, anyone who has a reasonable doubt should always ask anyone, boldly. Ask me. -Sir, We're asking the questions. But, the staff are ignoring. It's okay, ask them till you get the reply. Okay, sir. -Be seated. What? What's the difference between unifying in Science and unifying in Tamil? Hey, excellent question! I too thought of asking this question for many days. Hey... Not like that... What? I've this question for many days. But? Sit down. I'll tell you. -Okay, sir. What he is asking is not a disgusting matter. The world functions on the love of the male and female. The honor that comes when saying as love... ...if sarcastic when speaking openly about it means... ...we haven't learnt the science, properly. Good morning, mam. Sit down. Good morning, mam. -Morning, sir. Hey, look there. Both are taking the class. -If you want, continue the class. No, you carry on. Thank you. Hey. -Sir. Ask your doubt to mam. She'll clear you. -Okay, sir. What's your doubt? Sir, Dayalan is going overboard. Tell me something new. My wife called me and asked about her cooking? In the class time? -Yes, sir. I said, it's good. For that, he said, 'close this devil'. Did he tell your phone or your wife? Sir, leave it. Given ten questions to students and asked to answer in a nutshell. A goof has written that he 'knows' and 'doesn't know' as the answers. Enraged, I squeezed the paper and thrown out... He takes it and puts in the trash bin. He takes the trash and puts in the trash bin? Next, -Sir... Sir, the students keep asking more doubts. You may answer, if you had read. -Yes, sir. They ask questions before the class begins. Born to questions. When I went to his class to bring the attendance, The students are calling him by relationship as 'brother', 'friend' and 'dude'. Are they building the relationship? One more important message. -What? Come forward and whisper in my ears. More than that, a girl called him... -?Dayalan'... Who's that calling sir by name? Sorry, sir. Oh, it's okay. Say what you want to. -Dayalan, had food? My mother will ask the same. It's you asked, after her. Sir, don't we need to maintain a distance? We've to. They'll call us the same, tomorrow. -Calling us? What do you mean? -Sir, if he does something which they deny, How will the students respect them? Okay, is he done with that? -Still there? Whatever I read, doesn't stay. Whatever we eat also doesn't stay. For that, will you stop eating? Then, what? Don't memorize the lessons. Understand well and study. Who do you like? Cinema, sir. Assign an actor's name for each and every query. When looking at the question in examination, you'll remember. Understand? -Okay, sir. If not, give colours in your mind. Try something new. Go. -Thank you, sir. Sorry, mam. Hello, mam. Why are you behaving, rudely? He is hitting me like a buffalo. Instead of warning him, you're staring me. They're youths. We've to handle them, maturely. We've to handle them, maturely? Want me to speak mature? Sir, what are you talking about? Nothing I'm talking about. He must be of your son's age. I'll even tolerate his hitting. But, he said, that wastrel is like my son. ,That's what I couldn't tolerate. My son is only six years old, now. How could I react for it? Mam, do you've a son? When I first saw her in college, I thought she was a first year student. I was known later, she was the Professor. What's this? -Hey, wait. Hey, ask them to stop. -Stop it. Sir, not only he ruined our students. But, trying to get the support of the Professors, who were obedient to you. Especially, Pachiammal mam. Yes, sir. He intrudes, In her class. If you see them both talking here and there, Do they look like Professors? But as lovers. Look here, sir. If our college gets a bad name in the future, You're answerable to the management. Take care. Leave the matter about Pachaiammal. Her father belongs to our community. We can control her through her father. Do one thing. Come along to the Correspondent room. We'll put an end to this issue. Sir, they all forgot to tell you an issue. Because of the Tamil department in this college... -Good morning, sir. As * education is taught to all the students, What's the effect, now? Don't talk ill about the students. Speak with some respect. What's that I'm speaking disrespectful? You're a Professor of Tamil, including *... That's what, I'm saying. -Yes, sir. I taught about *... What's wrong in it? * education is a recognised subject. It's in our insight. Don't think bad of it. Then, the discipline is lost. Which is discipline? Insulting the student to stay away, who came to ask for doubt. Slapping the student, who hit by mistake Throwing away the exam paper in corridor, Spitting on the way where students walk, is this the discipline? Do you know what he says? Do you want the students to roam like unleashed cows, anywhere? I'm not saying like that. Then, how? -Don't collect fine for everything. What do you mean? -Fine for everything. Moreover, if a student does any mistake? ?his parents are called and made to wait till evening. Saying wrong about the student to his parents making then to lose confidence on him And the students lose confidence on them too. We abetted the suicide of eight students in 38 years. They were dead. Still, many students discontinued the studies and ran away unable to bear their torture. Henceforth, it shouldn't happen. Why did you stop? Breathless? Sir, he provoked the students to commute on their own instead of college bus? ?saying they'll be like broiler chickens. What's the effect? Our buses are running on loss. Students are travelling on footboard in public transport. The results will also be the same. The results aren't the life. Then? The life is different. It's not only in the college, it's outside too. What's outside? Not everyone in the classroom is doing the job related to his studies. Only a few will do. Sir, you tell me. Are you working for your qualification? Wow! Sir, do you understand? Do you know what is he trying to say? You couldn't study more than third grade. You brother never visited the school. On illegal money, you've constructed this college and became Correspondent. And wearing a mask as, "father of education". This is what he says. -Sir, just a minute. -Then? Why are you mistaking whatever I say? What are you trying to prove him, now? Sir, there wasn't casteism among students. But, the teachers had implemented the casteism. It's too bad. Education which doesn't teach virtues is dangerous. Here, who needs to be changed is not the students but the teachers. Sir, if I've done something wrong, punish me whatever. Sir, it's getting late for the class. I don't want to waste the class hours. Sorry, sir. Irritating. Sir, he himself told to take action. Take action, sir. First, remove the threads in your hand. Sir, this is our identity. To be honest, you've to tie it. My caste has the power to decide who is the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. I'll never give up the honour of my caste. If I need to remove the thread on hand, I'll hang on and die. I'll die. Come on, everyone. Leave. Sir, didn't you come? Go. -Okay. Sir, I'm not wearing the thread. I've twenty years of experience. I wish to be this College Principal when I retire. I belong to your caste, sir. Go...I told you to go. Think well. Thank you, sir. Heed me, next class is also free. Let's go to the movie. -What happened? Greetings, sir. -Why are you standing out? Staff didn't come. Whose class? Pachaiammal mam's class. Didn't she come? -She didn't come for past two days. Why should you stand out, for that? Stay in the classroom. -Okay, sir. Go. Hey, get in. Go. (Indistinct chatters) Take it. Hey Aadhi, What? -Sit down. Sit here. Have it. I had. It's okay, taste it. No, it's okay. Have it. Hey, look there. Some more. No. -Some more... Hey, go and hit him. Hey! -Hey, wait. Why to hit him before her? To fall in love on sympathy? Wait. Who are you to speak with her? A friend. Is the girl of our caste, is your friend? I know well what will you do in the name of friendship. Don't talk to her, anymore. Hey, why are you staring? Palani loves her, deeply. If you think of interfering, we'll slit your throat. Come on. Dayalan, I'm the Correspondent speaking. Greetings, sir. Tell me. I wish to do the felicitation function of Gomathinayagam, a grandeur. Good, sir. I'll assign the responsibility to you. Instead of taking responsibility ourselves, let's give to the students. We'll get new ideas from them. The function will have new look. There is a meaning in what I say, sir. Good, go ahead. Good, I'll discuss with the students. Sir, it's not the work of students. Don't assign your work to us. Okay, you don't come. Sit down. -Sir, I'm ready. Sir, I'll come. -Sir, I'm ready. Sir, 33% is for women. Shouldn't we participate? It was said, 'Ask for more'. I'll give fifty percent. Sir, I'll join. I too. You and Aadhi lead the team. They'll co-ordinate with you. I'll support you. -Okay, sir. You both come along. Others, go through the book until staff arrives. Don't make noise. Okay? -Thank you, sir. This is what the story of Annamalai, who took away with no effort. How do you shut the door of getting any chance to speak to her? Why are you looking me? Come, let's see what's happening there. If sir goes away from midst, your stance is worst. Sir is leaving, he left. Saw? He'll be in terms, if hit. Hey. Sir, girls first. Then... Hey, be careful. It's heavy. Mam! Mam, just a minute. Your face is looking different. You didn't come to the college for last four days. Your phone was switched off. A problem in my house. Why? Anyone was sick? We both talking and getting along, is the problem. You're citing reason like school children. He talks rubbish, sir. Who? The Principal. What's his problem? He yelled at my father. He ashamed me not only in my family but till the end of my street. Then? Then, nothing... My dad asked whether it's true? I said, no. Then, what? You'd have come to the college. What were you doing f or four days? I was thinking. What's it? I was wondering if there was anything wrong in that. Was there anything? No, you were thinking for four days, right? Was there anything? Nothing, right? Go and sit there. I thought it'll be good if there was something. Staffs should sit behind. Go and sit there. I know. -Go. See how I switched off her. Will never switch on, anymore. It's switched on. They spoke for half an hour. You provoked them. -I?ll take away the main switch, instantly. Sir, we shouldn't sit in front. Why? What will you do sitting in front? Just disturbing. In all the functions, staff sit in front and making us to sit at the back Staffs standing like bodyguards and instructing not to do this and that. That's why, boys behave so. Boys are our safety. Haven't you seen in Jallikattu protest? In this function, the boys sit in the front? ?then girls and boys at the back. Staffs can sit at the back. This function won't happen, lethargic. Just watch, how disciplined it's organised. Will it happen disciplined? The boys will jump out of the compound. It's good to let open. He has organised, right? Let's wait and watch till it mess up. Totally, four seats are here. -Okay, sir. For the Chairman, the Correspondent, to Gomathi nayagam. And what about the other? -Will it be for Dayalan? Go down a bit. Damn it. Talk to me like I feel happy. Greetings, sir! Welcome. -Greetings, sir. Greetings. -Greetings. How is it going on? Now, I welcome the 'man of the show' Dr. Gomathinayagam to the stage. What's this, sir? We invite our Principal to give welcome address. Go, sir. Greetings to all! In my education journey, I've met many Professors. But, sir is the best. He'll issue an order in his looks. A command is seen in his eyes. He is straightforward. I fondly call him as, 'a six feet lion'. A teacher should be strict. Straightforward like him. Only then, administration will be under our control. Both of their signals are rocking than the function. Else, how can we maintain these students? In this glorious time, I wish to convey our Chairman? ?and Correspondent. He is like me. I'm like him. In other words, If I'm the elephant, he was the 'elephant herd'. If he is a lone tiger, I'm streak of tigers. If he is 'Thirukkural' (Sacred verses), I'm 'Valaiyapathi, Kundalakesi' in Tamil literature. If he is 'Shakespeare'. I'm 'Shakesfire' Listen him. So, his image is going out of this college. But, the mirror of his image stays here. I wish to say the College administration will still do better. Thank you all. This function is new. Well disciplined. Thanks to the students who planned it. Thank you Dayalan for guiding. Come and talk, Dayalan. Go, sir. Thank the lord! The most resilient moment. We both aren't much familiar to each other. Just we'll smile when passing on. I understood one thing when everyone praised him. Very angered, behaves terror and intimidates by his eyes. Students are afraid of him. I see all these as criticism on him. Is it your family business to blame? Sir, if you don't mistake, shall I share a small grievance? Yes, tell me. Thank you. It's not only the grievance with sir. A small grievance with many Professors like him. The relationship between the students and him was like the water on the lotus leaf. Because, he wasn't close to the students. Always stayed away. He can't remember his students face or names, And their strengths and weaknesses. Because, he wasn't close to them. Brushing everything aside, When the Professors move close to the students? ?and ask about their problem, It would've been a medication for... ...the wounds of the students who have passed you. Sir, who needs the lion, tiger and bear? Who needs? We want teachers with humanity. No need of a qualified teacher. The students need a teacher who learns everyday. Forgive me, if I've said anything wrong. You speak only wrong things. We invite Professor Gomathinayagam to deliver the acceptance speech. When I was new to the job, I was enthusiastic in the classroom. When my studies and respect was grown? ?the enthusiasm disappeared and I became rigid. I became still rigid. The students were afraid of me. I was far away from the students. In classroom, there wasn't sharing between me and the students. What happened? It's late. You go. That hand should touch you. What Dayalan said is fact. He spoke well. Thank you. Now, our Correspondent will give the memento... Aadhi, take this. -Give. ...and felicitate. How was it? It's okay. -Okay? Hey, go... Go and hit him. Let's see whatever happens. Hey, come on. It's Physics. Didn't you get Chemistry, yet? Why didn't you get? -Have studied to some extent. Hey, Why are you staring? -What? Why are you staring? Listen me. Hit him. Hey, stop it. What's the problem? Stop it. I said, stop it. What's the problem, here? Sir, I'm silent. They're creating ruckus, unnecessarily. Why? Is everything because of you? You'll be spared. What will you do? As long as my dad is the Principal of this College, No one can do anything for me. Don't roam around in father's name. Try to achieve something on your own. Let me try. Are you hurt? -No, sir. What about you? -No, sir. Everyone go to the classroom. Is there division even at study place? Hey, stop. I'm watching you, you're showing off in the retirement function. Hey, not her even if I see you speaking to any of our caste girls, I'll kill you. Get lost. Palani doesn't like you speaking to Aadhi. Take it. -Thank you, sir. Come, let's go. Enough, go away sir. Tell me, sir. To eradicate the caste feeling among the students... ...you've conducted the felicitation function involving them. Yes. -All your efforts are waste, sir. They're brawling more than before. They're asking to think us more than before.. Let's think. Kavin, come on. Wait, I'll have water and come. Still ten days, more. Can take, leisurely. Why are you in hurry? Readymade attires for children is okay. But for others, need to be stitched. Sivasamy sir. -He is inside. Okay. Be careful. -Okay, grandpa. Why are you doing so, mom? Leave me. -Is it ready? Greetings! -It's over, sister. Take it. Sivasami sir? -It's me. I'm Dayalan. I know. -Children, go out and play. I'm the Tamil Professor in Appa Arts College. I know. People who said wrong about your daughter would've said worst about me. But, one this is true. Whatever the Principal said is false. He has outrage on me. So, he has thrown mud on everyone who speaks to me. Mam is pityful. Pachaiammal, mam. Be seated. On that day, when he spoke to me? ?about my daughter -No, sir. I know what he'd have said. It seems to be a large family. We've been in the same house for four generations. In the same house, 166 people. Yet to be born two babies. Nowadays, families exist like Islands. Happy to see a large family like this. How many people in your family? I'm alone. Might be because of that, I yearn to be a member of a joint family. Greetings, Sir! -Welcome, mam. Wonder, you're here sir! I came to meet your father. Is it self-explanation? -Might be. Greetings, sir! -Greetings, Why are you here? After dad was discharged from the hospital, mam is teaching me tailoring. If I buy a tailoring machine, Somehow I'll manage. This is what, 'Instead of feeding a fish, it's good to teach how to catch it'. Great! Mam, my respect for you is increasing day by day. I'm leaving. You came to ask something. No, I came to convey and I did. Bye. -Dad, I'll be back. I yearn to be a member of a joint family like this. Dude, just a minute. Dude, I understood what you've conveyed. But, I can't take any decision, solely. I can decide after consulting all. After deciding, I'll convey through her. Okay. Don't think, everyone is just going around. They're heeding every word of your's. Uncle, did you heed? -Yes, well. I too heard. Heard this far? Your name was spoilt because of me. I'm trying to rectify it. So, there is something in which I said as nothing. The gossips has brought us here. If we get acceptance, that's the next level of our friendship. Bye. Brother! What happened? They're chasing me, save me. Okay, go inside and hide. Hey, who are you? If I doesn't get her, I'll kill you. Look there. Look well. She isn't here. Hello, Police station? I'm speaking from Netaji Nagar. He is calling the police. Come on. Hit him. Are you calling the police? I'll kill you. Come on. Don't be afraid. Be silent. They've gone. Okay,who are they? My brother's friends. Your brother's friends? My cousin. I considered him as a brother. But, he didn't consider me as his sister. He took videos of me when bathing and dressing up and sent to his friends. Now, they threaten to upload in social media. Don't cry. Hello! Dayalan, sir. What's your father? He is the Professor in the college. His name? Azhagiya Tamil Manalan. I've mistaken you, Dileepan. Forgive me. Sir! I apologize, falling on your foot. Sir, don't cry. You've saved my honour. Sir, she is my sister. Sir! Why are you weeping? Stop it, first. Mom is saying, isn't it? Get fresh up. Sir, because of crying like this, they're bravely doing faults. Sir, take your daughter to the police station and file a complaint. Sir, by giving complaint, you want to be humiliated? Sir, all the officers won't be the same. There are honest officers too. If we take action now, it'll be a protection to other girls like her. You gotta be brave. I'll bring the lawyer. Okay, sir. They rape a three year old girl. A ten years old girl is gang raped and killed. The girl who trusts a guy as a friend... ...and goes along was beaten, tortured, made naked ? ?and takes video of her and spreads across the country. What's happening in this country? Can't we stop all this? - Why not? As the offender easily escapes, Crimes are on the rise. They must have fear. They must have fear of dying. Penalties should be tougher. That should be executed, immediately. People who commit mistake must brought before the public and his head... Then, who will commit mistake? No one will do. In our country, people are punished only for crimes. Punishment is not given for chastisement. The one who was imprisoned for petty theft, comes back as.... It's all a curse for us. Damn it! Hey, see whether she looks at me? Good morning, sir. Greetings, sir. -Greetings. What happened? Why today's greeting is dragging? Last day of the week and it's last hour class. That's why... That's why, dragging. Sit down. Sir, it'll be good if we've college on alternate days. Yes, it'll be good. Yes, sir. Sir, we had physical training class in the school. There is no such thing here. Sit down. Okay, do one thing. Take this session as physical training hour. Okay? - Okay sir. Hey, what happened? He has filled my scholarship form, wrongly. Why did you give him? Sit down. Not for you, many students have this problem. Doesn't know how to fill the scholarship form, voter ID, ration card, ? ?aadhar card and even the bank challan. What to do? Our education system is for the teachers. The day when it changes for the students, everything will be right. It's your weekend holidays, right? Yes, sir. Throw away all your books and come. Let's meet somewhere, outside. Let's learn what is needed for the life. A classroom without walls, okay?

Why are you brawling? Don't brawl. Don't brawl. The students are divided into two groups and indulged in clash. Shoot everything in your cellphone. - Okay. He is holding me. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. -Leave me. Hit him. I'll kill you. Dare to touch. You're done. You're dead. Aadhi! Catch him. Thump him. -Why are you hiting too? Why are you hitting him? Leave him. Don't hit. This area looks to be nice, isn't it? - Yes, mam. Sir, they're hitting each other. Where? Hey, don't hit. Hey, don't hit. Stop it. Sir! Dayalan sir! The students are indulged in brawl. Where? (Indistinct voices) Don't fight. Hey! Hit him. Please, heed me. Leave him. Don't fight. Please, heed me. Hey, don't hit. This is why, I said not to bring them out. See, what happened? Sir. Stop it. Sir, he is the reason for all this. Hey, ask him to leave me. Hey... What? Hey, stop it. Heed me. Stop it. Will anyone heed me? Stop it. Come here. Stop it. I'm telling you. Did I teach this? Is this why I brought you out? You're students. I want you all to be unified beyond the caste. Is this wrong? It's wrong. I did a mistake. I've lost to you all. Hey, I don't like to see you all. Go away. Just a minute, sir. All these problems is because of me. I want to speak to all. Palani, you don't like me speaking ith Aadhi, from the beginning. So, you brought the caste along with it, isn't it? Do you know how he struggles to attend the college? Only today, I see him laughing, happily. You don't like it, right? A true friend is the one who understands the difficulty of a classmate. I see Aadhi as my friend.. I think of him as my sibling. It's you misunderstood us. For a middle class girl like me... ...do you know how difficult it is to come up to college? Do you know how many people we cross, who blabber as love? Do you know how many people have missed... ...their lives citing the earlier reasons? I thought nothing like that should happen. Is it wrong to think I should be a role model for those who comes next to me? What's the hell is the caste? Did you wish to be born in this caste or did he? It happens on it's own. And we're within that. The man who lends his hand in a predicament would be an unknown person. Your community people won't come. Do you know what will he do? He'll think, you've to keep struggling and you need to be advised. Adding the caste name or retaining the caste as name... Is all these a pride? Shame on you. Palani, I too like you. First, let's study. Come up well in life. Why to hurry? You won't change. Don?t change. If I come to college, you keep fighting citing me as a reason. I'm leaving. You tie this caste thread not only in hand... But also to neck and hang yourself. Sorry! Sorry, sir. I'm the reason for all the issues. Aadhi! Sorry! Palani. I feel happy, now. Sir, full evidence is here. Watch this. Who did you ask to take the students out? Sir, it's a holiday. Holiday means? What if anything happened to the students? People would've spoke ill about our college. Nothing has happened, right? Sir,"Educate, agitate and organise" was quoted by Ambedkar. Because I took the students out, Though there are tweeny fights, they've buried the dirt of caste and are humans. Good! It's good. So, you'll create arson, if something good must happen. Good, there were no casualties. He is arrogantly speaking as he escaped luckily. He has shown his outrage on sir to his son. If the Principal stays silent despite all this? ?it's his generosity not to yield a bad name to our college. If anyone else, sure would've created caste riots. Sir, take some action. Not some action? 'Dismiss' is enough. Yes, sir. Dismiss him. Stop it. Dayalan, I'm suspending you for six months. Sir! I expected you'll say a word, 'dismiss' and expel him. But, you're favouring him. Enough, stop it. Thank you. Sir, this group supports him. Suspend them all. Do it, let me see. You can leave. Though the judgement is a mess up, it's better. He isn't dismissing. Sir! To be honest, you must've been appreciated But, they've suspended you. It's okay, leave it mam. Sir, we must do something. Sir, we've achieved what we thought. The students are united. We can take them easily to the next level. For this, not a semester... ...I'll be in suspension even for a year, happily. But one thing sir, They might tie the thread again and confuse the students. Be careful. Bye. Sir, no one is in the classrooms. I'll take care, go. Okay, sir. Such an incident never happened in the history of our college. Would I let it happen, if I were the Principal? I can hear you. VP means Wastrel. You'll only be VP, until I retire. Let's see. Go and call. He has gone to make a call. Given the signal, it seems? Don't I know what will you do behind? Done? Good morning, sir. Are students creating ruckus? No, sir. The college is compact. Be careful, the issue might go to the media. The whole college is in silence. He is showing off as if he is the reason for the silence. Isn't it? Each and everything is under my control, sir. I'm coming there. Hang up the call. Come. He has informed the Chairman. He is frowning. What to do? Just wait. Let's give a last try, sir. Do it immediately. Okay, sir. Don't take a week time. Dude, come here. Ask him. What? What's your problem? What's the reason to suspend Dayalan sir? It's for your goodness. Reason? The reason... Everyone has written the same. It won't be right, come on. We didn't expect students will go to this end. Yes, sir. Somehow, manage. Come, let's manage. Sir. What happened? It's not going to be right. Is this a reply? We must do something before the Chairman arrives. Squeeze your brain for an idea. It has to be there to squeeze, right? The world knows you don't have. Sir, shall we lift four students and brainwash them? I thought you're standing just but you're brainy. Come down. Go ahead, immediately. Go at the back gate of the college. Dude, call Dayalan and tell him to come. - Okay, brother. Look here, you must say the same to the Correspondent. If you change anything, the Principal will issue the TC. Okay, sir. We'll do as you said. They'll do, perfectly. You both are my reflections. Sir, the Correspondent came. Let?s go, sir. Don't go anywhere, until we come. Stay here. He has come. We'll get a solution. Greetings, sir. What's happening there? It's the task of Dayalan. Come and see. Come fast. Look sir, look at his atrocities. Why are you sitting out instead of going to the classroom? What's that, everybody is showing their hands as 'reason'? He is the only reason for all these. Listen, put your hands down. Put down. He is coming. He has come. He is nearing. As usual, he'll exaggerate the Shakespeare's drama above than his height. Expel him from the college by evening. You won't leave, right? Where is he? Don't let him, please. Though you leave, I won't. Please. Greetings, sir. Is this your task? Sir, I didn't do anything? The students are doing something in affection on me. Just a minute, I'll speak to them. What are you going to speak? You've created clans by speaking. What else to speak? Sir, we've the evidence for he is the reason for everything. Go and bring the boys. Okay, sir. Hurry up. What these four guys says is the fact. (Indistinct voices) Mam! Come. Sir, I had hold with compact and discipline without any complaints. He has ruined everything. Why are you looking at me? Tell the Chairman, what has happened. Sir, Dayalan sir told us... ?he was suspended for six months and asked us to protest? ?not attending the classes till his suspension gets cancelled. Heed him, sir? Hey, stop it. You were sitting here, isn't it? Sir, I'm the reason for the problem, on that day. You'd have asked us before suspending Dayalan sir. Because of him, we're united throwing away our casteism. Got it, sir? He has sharpened my son against me. Nothing like that, sir. We want Dayalan sir. If not, our protest will continue. She isn't saying it. He has rented his mouth to them. Sir, say the balance too. Sir, what you taught me was over. Sir asked me to say like this about Dayalan sir. No, sir. In a small gap, ...he had erased our evidence. Hey, stop it. We want Dayalan sir. I've entrusted you and handed over the college. What are you doing? We want Dayalan sir. I blindly believed you. Don't stand before me. Sir, heed me. Sir, don't take any decision in hurry. We want Dayalan sir. -Stop it. Who has pelted the stone? Sir. Stop it. Who has pelted the stone on the glass? I know, our students won't do it. Who? This too is a failure. Really, if you've affection on me, ...you must be in the classroom in ten seconds. Go. -Come on. Heed the Principal. Don't go. Stop. Heed the Principal. Don't go. Heed the Principal. Dayalan, those who are afraid of you went inside. Those who are true, stayed back. What are you going to say them? Tell me. Who are you? No ID too? Who allowed you, inside? Sir, you told us to come. Is it getting confirmed, sir? He brought the culture of biryani and booze in this compound too. My heart beat stops when thinking of him. When did I said to come? You called us, now. Tell my phone number. He'll tell, now. Tell my phone number. He?ll tell now. 9444... Sir, be quiet. Tell me. Students? Tell my phone number. Rascal. Who told you to come in? Correspondent sir! Just... Why is the Tamil Professor banging the wall? Do you think the Tamil Professor will sport a traditional look and be afraid if you stare? I know to read 'Kamba Ramayanam' and also to hit furiously. He is fuming. Who are they? Ask them. Save me from him. Behind you. Who told you to come? Who? Who told you to come? I'll tell, sir. -Who told you to come? Tell me. Who told you to come? I'll tell, sir. -Tell me. Ask them, sir. Hit him, sir. Hey, thugs. Don't know to hit and to escape. What the thugs you're! Hit him. Senseless guys. Labourers. Don't know how they came in and who is the reason. Is it you? It's right to hit the wastrels with the blocks. Isn't it, sir? Correspondent. I know, the students didn't protest on my provoking. Like wise, you know who is the reason who made the thugs intrude... ...among the students, pelted the stones and created ruckus. But, you won't take any action. And you can't. Because, few letters will inhibit you. The caste. I would've got permission from you and took the students out. What I did is a mistake. But, students say they felt good. That's their generosity. I'm cancelling your suspension. Go to the class. Thank you, sir. We can't leave it so. Then, the staff members can create issues. Why should we get into new perplexes? Why to create a new habit? So, we'll give a minimum suspension. Is 15 days okay? I can understand your stance. It's okay, sir. I'm leaving. Then, students? I'll speak to the students. They'll obey me. Bye, sir. -Bye. You might've done. I know. -No. Don't I know about you? Go carefully. Let's see, tomorrow. -Bye. Hey! -What? He shouldn't come to our house, next time. Why? -What's his caste and our caste? Dare to speak against me. I feel ashame of saying you as my father. -What did you say? Palani, don't speak against father. Is he telling you to spoilt you? -I don't know all those. I'll stand by whoever does good. -Is what we do is bad? My mother came running and said about your birth. I came to the hospital ward. You were looking at me, sharply. If I'd have killed you, then... That's bad. But, I've brought you up. This is good. Will you lend your hand to the guest, ditching me? The dog which I fed with the biscuit should move around me. The horse which I fed with horsegram should take me to ride. Hey, how is that you get ready to give your life for the leader? If you give your life to the leader, what will you give to the parents? Look here... Heed me, well. From this moment, I'm the leader and the father for your son. Where has he left? We must distinct clearly between the milestones and activities. Can you understand? An activity is a part of the project. That takes place over the period of the time. Can you understand anything? Nothing is understood, sir. What didn't you understand? If you read the same from the book, how can we understand? Please, explain us. This is clearly explained. If you can't understand this, what else will you understand? Sit down. What? Sir, we can't understand Chakrapani sir's method of teaching. Just he reads from the book. How many Professors are there for you? Seven Professors. Except Chakrapani, can you understand the teachings of other's? They're better than him. Better? I'm one among those six. Why have you become silent? Sir, it'll be good if we get another Professor. What? Sir, we don't want a qualified teacher. We need a teacher who learns, everyday.. I heard this somewhere! Sir, it was said by Dayalan in Gomathi nayagam's function. Yes. How did you study all these days? By memorizing, right? Carry on the same. Okay, sir. -Send them. Go. -Come, let's do the same. Earlier, students will ask only doubts. Now, they ask to change the Professor. Not only that, they say he administration is not good. What will you do from this moment... -Tell us, sir. You'll be memorising the contents of the syllabus, isn't it? Yes, sir. -Stop it. Okay, sir. Instead, notice the students who speaks in favour of Dayalan. Okay, sir. Target them. -Okay, sir. Because of your torture, They must become insane. Will you do? -We'll do, sir. Hey, look there. Hello! Sir, my father asked you to come, immediately. Okay, coming. -Okay. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Greetings. Greetings! -Welcome! Greetings! -Greetings. Greetings! -Greetings. Greetings! Greetings! -Greetings! Welcome! You've come soon. Be seated. Sister, it's getting late. I'm leaving. Okay. A happy message. -Tell me. Everyone in home agreed for the marriage. That means, aren't you accepting? If everyone accepts, then myself too. Great pleasure! We'll fix the marriage, immediately. Tell us, where to conduct the marriage? Brother, Greetings! Generations together you live in this house. It's a temple to me! If you all bless us, we'll lead a happy life. Glad, we'll conduct the marriage here. Hey, stand up. Why are you hissing like a snake? Only two fans in this classroom. No air. It's sultry. Yes, only two lights also. Oh, will you excel in studies if you've fan and light? When you concentrate on the lesson, How will you think of these? Sit down. Idiots. Why are you late? I fell in the pit at the college entrance... ...so went home to change the attire. That's why, I'm late. Just roaming somewhere and saying telling tales. Leave from here. What's this? A diagram, sir. It's like a vomitted sample. Is this a diagram? You know to complaint the tank is not clean, the drinking water is not good? ?and dengue spreads because of mosquitoes. But, don't know to do the record, properly. It's exact, isn't it sir? Am I finding fault? If you create any issues, I'll dump you in the practical examinations. Go. Sir, earlier they avoided us without clearing the doubts when asked. But, now they're torturing, indirectly. -Yes, sir. After the strike, Instead of solving the problems, They're trying to shut our mouths. It means, they're afraid of you. You'll get response from them. But, it'll take time. You've to wait till then. But, don't stop questioning them, okay? -Okay, sir. Student power is the greatest power in the world. You'd have heard the speech of the political leaders like... ?the pillars of the nation, future of Indian nation etc. Yes, sir. That's true! As you all are lineant, they cheat you and enjoy. You must wake up. Get ready. You must be bold enough to face your problems. Sir, they're threatening us when questioned. Yes, they'll do so. The 'power' threatens. It'll intimidate you even among many. Will panic, grab and mislay. You must ask your needs as an organisation. That means, 'Students council'? Yes, still better. -?Students charitable board'. Still... -?Revolutionary students society' Still....that is you shouldn't plead for your needs? ?but ask with authority. It must be like that. 'Students Parliament'. Very good. 'Students Parliament' It'll develop your personality skills along with your needs. Super sir. Shall we start? -Yes, sir. Who is the Prime Minister? Palani. Hey! Who is against Palani to be prime Minister? Sir, Aadhi is the Prime Minister. Just wait. Don't start the fuss as clans. Wait, shall we decide by voting? -Okay, sir.

Our college restrooms are fragrant, today. Wait. Let's go step by step. Stop it. What are you doing here? Cleaning the toilets, sir. The administration will look after it, if said. But the administration didn't heed even after telling. Look here, those who question has one thought. Those who heed has thousands of thoughts. The mind would've been clumsy. You must ask still it listens. We've asked many times but didn't get response. Still you'd have asked, right? Would've asked thousand times. Don't speak against me. Sir, unable to bear the stenchy smell, not using the washroom? ?a girl is affected by urinary tract infection and got admitted in the hospital. Doctor cited this as the reason.

Will you become a Minister, by flushing the toilet. Be the college Principal for just one day. Then, you'll know what administration is. What's that administration? Not only the college, we're able to rule the nation too. First, clear out the arrears, and save your parents money. Then, save your nation . Come, let's go. Immature students. Sir, instead of studying, the students are administrating the college. What? Doing administration? Yes, sir. It won't be effective if said to elder brother. That's why, I'm saying you. Come in person and see. Okay, hang up the call. I'll come. Greetings, sir! Look there. They've done like proving the students administration is better than the Principal's. I told you earlier. You didn't bother. But, if I were the Principal, I would've done a better job than this. Call them. Sir! -Come. They're coming. Greetings, sir. -Greetings, sir. Why are you coming to the college? To study. But, you're doing everything other than that. If anything is not proper, you've to inform the Principal. Instead, you're doing everything. Sir, we've informed the Principal several times. Instead of solving the problems... ...he started to take revenge on the students who complain on problems. As no other go, we've started to rectify our issues by ourselves. You'd have approached me, if not him? I thought everything is going on well. Henceforth, inform me your problems, directly. I'll solve it, immediately. First, disperse the "Students Parliament" and concentrate on your studies. Sorry, sir. We didn't start it just to solve the issues in the college campus. Even to solve our issues outside, To improve our personality skills and to protect our fundamental rights. Our studies will not be affected because of this. We're learning more. We'll take care of not spoiling the name of our college management. Tell us, if anything goes wrong, we'll think of dissolving the Parliament. But can't do now. Are you the Prime Minister, talking so much? No, sir. He didn't come. Okay, go. Thank you sir. -Thank you sir. Tell the Principal to come. Chakrapani. -Yes, sir. Why are they standing here? To grab your post. Good afternoon, sir. May I know the reason for calling me? Don't you notice at the outset if the students complaint? Just a second, sir. VP, go out. Going to get scoldings but need dignity. Go away. Sir, if I wish to fulfill the desires of the students,. You need to go to the bank, often. Why? To get the loan. Sir, isn't two lights and two fans enough for each classroom? They want all that to be switched on. Is it an educational centre or an entertainment park? Sir, they wish right from drinking water to restroom water? ?everything must be purified. Is it possible? Our students will get money from their dad, pay the college fee? ?will steal the small savings of their mother, watch movie, sleep and stays quiet. Though have arrears, they don't bother and stay happy. They were provoked, And someone is walking high. Who is the reason for all these? Dayalan, who thinks himself as holding the legacy of Tamil. He is misusing the students behind the screen. He is the bad operator for this college. -Stop it, sir. If you'd have solved the problems at outset, why it's coming so far? When asked the students to dissolve the parliament? ?they're asking me, what's your problem because of that? Didn't they heed you? Asked you, what's your problem? Let's do one thing, sir. Shall we create a problem among them and keep them occupied of that problem? Why, sir? Will you think controversially for everything? Henceforth, make sure no problem emerges. Go, sir. I'll take care without any problem, sir. Sorry, sir. (Indistinct voices) Why have all the parents come? Hey wastrel, can't you understand? Explain him. I'll tell him, sir. If any problem arises because of the "Students Parliament", They all said to Correspondent, they would dissolve it, immediately. These people are the slaves organised by sir. This is a trap. The set dosa is coming. One of them is just getting down. Where's another one? Greetings, sir! - Greetings. Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Is it going on still, calling the parents to meet and making them to stand all day? They're asking, "will you take the College fees and let our children to clean the toilet?"... ...and yelling me for past one hour. Sir. -Tell me. I'm from 'NAM TV' Have to meet the Correspondent. He didn't come, today. The Chairman has come. Come on. Sir, they've come to meet you. Greetings, sir. -Greetings. Through "Students Parliament" you've given them a good chance to rectify the problems by themselves. So, we've selected your College as an exemplary College in Tamil Nadu. We've come to take a special interview, sir. You're welcome. Prem. -sir. Mount the camera on stand. Keep it, here. Sir, we want to interview Dayalan sir too. Gopal. -Sir. Call Dayalan. -I'll call, sir. Sir, call the important members of the Parliament also for interview. Gopal. -I?ll bring them also, sir. What's going on here? Prem, ready? Just a second, sir. Sir...sir... I'm calling you. Sir...sir... I'm calling you. It's bit disturbing. Go out. Come left. That's it. -Are they teasing me? Speak now, sir. Initially, I too thought whether the students need this Parliament? After noticing their activities, I realized they need it. Students are like match sticks. If we be a little spark, They shall shine forth. I was afraid to go to the nearby grocery store, Now I'm ready to face the society... with courage and personality. That's because of Dayalan sir and our "Students Parliament". My daughter! -Good. Not ashamed to say, I don't know to fill a scholarship form. Now, I can help anyone to fill all types of forms. That's because of the life skills taught by Dayalan sir. Forgive us, sir. How do we as parents know, what's happening in the College? This Principal called on phone. He said the students are roaming in the name of "Students Parliament", ? and asked us to ask it in the management. That's why, we came. Our children are going in the right path. We're happy to meet you. -Happy! We're leaving, sir. -Bye. Hey, Principal! Stay good. Good, sir was there. -Yes. If you do like this, I'll expel you from the post. Be cautious. Sir, like Dayalan sir was suspended for 15 days? ?let him be suspended for a week. No... just suspend him for one day? ?assign me as the Principal and see my management. You'll understand, then. Hey, don't irritate. Get lost. As usual, it's also 'no ball'. Brother! Hey, come. Greetings, sir! -Come on. Greetings, sir. -Be seated. Why is the session here, today? Problem in the education department, sir. Problem? What's it? These both guys discontinuing the studies and going to Chennai for job. Why? Father's health is getting worse. My sister's earnings is not sufficient. My educational expenses along with my sister?s? ?and father's medical expenses, all these are tough to manage. My friend works in Koyambedu market, thinking of joining him. I'm also going, sir. Where are you going? Both of my brothers didn't even complete the schooling. I managed to enter the college. We've pledged our land for studies. My sister-in-law is torturing of losing the land. Yeah, you had appeared for TNPSC exams, isn't it? Yet to get the results, sir. Just wait. Have you studied 18 years, to work in the marketplace? Complete your degree in four months, okay? Until then, if you need any support, I'll do. Will this degree get us a job, immediately? Don't say like that. -What's wrong in it, sir? Do the people here are studying with interest? Take me, I must've studied MBBS. They conducted an entrance exam, Asked wrong questions in it and degraded many talented students like me. Yes, sir. Cheetah runs at the speed of 70 km/ hour, is it right or wrong? is the question. What's the meaning of it, in Tamil? The 'Cheetah' runs at the speed of 70 km/hr. Is it right or wrong? It's the meaning, isn't it? But, do you know what did they ask? 'Seetha' runs at the speed of 70km/hr, is it right or wrong? Which 'Seetha' do I think of? I marked it as wrong. They made me failed. So many wrong questions like this. They said marks will be given to all such questions. But, didn't give till the last. Somehow, I must settle down in life. What's that meant as 'settle'? Tell me. Earning crores of rupees and wandering without peace, is that? We must earn to fulfill our needs and live happily. Whatever we study, we've a job. It means we didn't knock the right door. You say the degree is useless. You've a job for this degree. If you knock the right door, you'll get it. Call Palani Muthu. Okay, brother. Hello, tell me. -Hi, Palani, Greetings, sir. Tell me, sir. Okay, sir. Best wishes. -Thank you, sir. We'll send a circular to all through the Correspondent to discuss what you said. Sir. Circular, sir. I'll send circular to others. But, you got a circular now. The Correspondent has sent it on behalf of "Students Parliament". Read it. Is your granny frying the fryums? You read it. -Yes, sir. What happened? Vision problem, sir. Ever you must've the spectacles in your pocket. If you skid in the drainage, who'll respond to your wife? In order to discuss about the future of the students, You're asked to participate, definitely. -Through the Correspondent. Who calls and who goes? Send it to him. Sir, if you don't come now, VP will occupy the seat. If I don't come? Have you signed, already? Take it. Greetings, sir! -Greetings, sir! Be seated. Tell me. Sir, we can't be sure whether students who finish their degree here can do further studies. So, you want us to give job in this college, my son? No, sir. Like the placements done by campus interviews in the Engineering colleges, We can do in our campus too. Is this campus IIT Engineering college? To fetch you all for leading companies? Just wait, sir. Why are you hindering at the outset? It's an arts and science college. Rude students. How is it possible? We must talk, sir. Let's discuss. Oh, it's the revolution of ten fingers! How it is possible? Why it's not possible? Those who've studied Tamil has jobs in Malaysia, Singapore and Mauritius. Those who work in the call centres are B.A., English gradutes. Chemistry graduates have more jobs. As sir said, only WIPRO and TCS aren't there. Many small companies exist in the city. We can try there. The effort is the first success. By talking with quotes, you made everyone to sit equally. Today, they're sitting equally, Next might sit on my lap and later might play with the Correspondent. Sir, what's your problem? You're the problem. -What did I do? What didn't you do? You made the Principal to sit like a beggar. My self dignity is hurting. Singaperumal! -Sir. Be quiet, sir. -Turn back. Sorry sir. Dayalan, will the companies consider our college students for the placements? Definitely, they'll support. Sir, the successful people look for goals. The defeaters only look at the hindrances. We'll take effort, sir. Okay, go ahead. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
