What do you make of it? Well, it could be anything. Hard to tell. A ship would be showing lights. River pirates wouldn't. I'm not taking any chances. Alert the crew and break out the guns. Pull out everything. Yes, sir. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please. This is just a precaution. Keep clear of the windows. There may be shooting. Stewards, secure the blinds. What is this, a raid? River pirates. Sure. This is the same place they stopped us the last time. I could use some men with guns up on deck. Come on, Jack. Might be it. Might be. It's dark enough. Uh, gentlemen, I suggest we let the cards cool off. Hold it! Hold it! That's no boat. It's trees and dead logs, Marshal. The river's full of 'em. And full of pirates too. False alarm. Well, good practice for the crew anyhow. They could use it. Two boats raided this month and nobody caught. You know, Matt, there's only one way to stop 'em. Arrest everybody between St. Louis and Fort Benton that isn't honest. That should relieve you, Mr. Porter. Sorry thing if some pirate took the pot. Not so sure one didn't. It's, uh, your deal, I believe, sir. You know, I think there's a setup between that young man and the gambler. Cards, please. Two. I'll have three, please. Three. Dealer takes three. What's the opener say? 100. 200. Well, I'll... I'll raise you 300. Well, suppose we make it an even thousand, Mr. Porter? I fold. Well, I'll-I'll... I'll call you for the thousand and... Three aces. Sorry. Not quite good enough. Full house. I'm cleaned. Well, you could arrange credit. I don't have any credit. Well, I've had enough. Anyone care to fill in? Sure. That was a pretty rotten thing you did. What was? Cheating the old man. Easy, Matt. Porter was playing with other people's money. He's got to account for that money to the man he works for. That's usually the case with four-flushers, isn't it? That's not the point. I saw you dealing from the bottom of the deck. Matt. I think you owe me an apology, sir. Don't push your luck, boy. If you were cheating... and I have no doubt you were... you'll slip up one of these days. When you do, the law will be on the side of the man who kills you. Now move along. Simmer down, Matt. There's nothing you can do about it. Mister, you forgot something. The apology, but that can wait. I didn't know your friend was playing with someone else's wad. He was throwing it around like he owned the bank. I don't think that changes the situation as far as you're concerned. Tell me something, sir. Do you ever gamble? Not with strangers. Or with other people's money. That's right. Well, why don't you try it? That ought a get you in the game. What does the opener say? 200. I fold. I call. I'd, uh, like to break your luck, Mr. Comfort. How about flavoring it up, say, 500? Let's make it a thousand. Not sweet enough. 1,500. That's too tall for me. Looks like all three of us have something this hand. Let's play for, uh, 2,000. The last raise did it. You lost me. Well, you didn't lose me. I call. What do you got? Very little, I'm afraid. Well, a pair of fives. That makes my three nines mighty powerful. You seem to have lost heavily, stranger. Guess it's not my night. They've been running bad for me too. Isn't it customary to give a man a chance to get even? Why, I wouldn't know. I'm not familiar with the niceties of the game. I figured you for a man of high ideals. Seems I was wrong. You did. I figured you for a bad loser. I was right. I trust you sleep well, sir. I shall... with this beside me. Good evening. Come in and shut the door. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a cheat. Especially if he's working against me. And that's what you were doing, Ben, my lad, wasn't it? Me that dredged you out of a St. Louis sewer, raised you like a father and even taught you a gentleman's trade. For this you sell me out to a clumsy mark... who wouldn't know a flush from a fish. What kind of a split did he give you? He didn't give me anything. How much? Nothing. Don't tell me you're going soft. Maybe, but tonight I got so fed up, I gave this sucker a break. At my expense? You're even. You took it from the other mark. That's for selling me out, you dirty little sneak. I could've overlooked it if you'd taken a cut, but just to give a sucker a break, to see his big, happy smile... that's the most dishonest thing I ever heard of. I can never trust you again. We're through, Ben. I was gonna quit anyway. Who is it? That little jizzy with the big brown eyes in Galena? She's part of it. What a criminal waste of talent. Uh, some... someday, I'll pay you back what I owe you. Just leave me those clothes you're wearing. I'll need 'em for another shill. Good luck, Carrico. Luck? What makes you think I ever needed that, boy? You're out of a job, aren't you? What's the difference? Well, I feel it's partly my fault. I gave Porter back his money. Here's yours. Thanks. Step in here a minute, will you? I think we ought a have a little look at that lip of yours. Yeah, yeah. He's got a cut lip too. A little paint fix that. There you are. Sit down. You know, this lip will heal all right by itself. You don't owe me anything. Well, I owe you an apology, and I thought I might make it over a drink. I don't drink unless it's business. Oh. Well, cigar? Uh, likewise. What's on your mind? Business. Any plans? Well, I'm through with gamblers, if that's what you mean. I've been getting around to offering you a job, but I'd like to feel sure. I'd like to know I made the right move. How can you be sure of any move before you make it? Well, you can't, but there's less risk in buying proven merchandise, which you are not. What do you know about horses? I like 'em. They don't ask any questions. Well, like that wooden Indian friend of yours. Say, what are you doing with that thing anyway? My brother, Brand, asked me to pick one up for him. It's a hobby of his, collecting odd trophies. Our real business is ranching. If that idea appeals to you, look me up. Thanks. I'm going to have to talk to someone about this. Not the gambler. Oh, no, no. It's a girl. Oh. She wants to get married. Then you're going to nee a job. Say, you try pretty hard to be fair, don't you, mister? Well, I just find it's the easiest way. You've been doing things the hard way, son. Good night. Good night. Hey, son. I saw you going into Matt Comfort's cabin. That's right. And now I'm going into mine. Let me give you a tip. Keep away from Mr. Comfort. Why should I? He offered me a job. What kind of a job? You ask him. Look, Mr. Comfort and I are all squared away, Marshal. What are you worrying about? I just wouldn't want to see him clipped. Neither would the folks in Galena. They think a lot of him. Galena? I didn't know his ranch was there. It's a small town packed full of Matt's friends. Anyone who isn't is sort of in the minority, if you get the point. I'll keep it in mind. And I'll be keeping you in mind. Oh, my... Mr. Com... There's been a murder on the Montana Queen. Matt Comfort. Matt Comfort? Murdered? Who did it? Did they catch him? Got one of 'em, all right. Some gambler. I'd better get Graham back. Did I hear you right about my brother? That's what it says, Mr. Comfort. Gambler's name is Carrico. Still looking for his shill. Some kid. Boat's due in half an hour. Don't worry, Mr. Comfort. We'll take care of this. Cast the line! Hold it! Where's Carrico? Where's the gambler? That's him! The one with the marshal. Bring him down, or we're gonna come up and get him! What are you trying to do, get an innocent man lynched? This mob will tear me to pieces. Not if I can get you behind bars. And who says you're innocent? Bring him down! We'll tear him apart. Looks bad. Let's get him inside his cabin. Hurry up. Get 'em! Take their guns! That man's my prisoner. I demand you turn him over to me. Be glad to, Marshal. We only want him for about five minutes. See if you can find his shill. He's gotta be on board someplace. Hurry it up! Somebody get a wagon! Doesn't he get a trial or something? Naturally. That's the jury coming in now. Come on! - Yeah. Hey. - Whoa! Come on! Hang him. Let's string him up. Come on! ** ** Put a rope around his neck! Bring him on, boys! ** You'll see lots of hangings if you stay around here. Let me go, Mr. Boucher. Much more stylish ones. A hanging is like a good dinner. It requires preparation. They're in too much of a hurry tonight. So are you. You can't do this to me. Oh, Ben. I was afraid they'd found you. They've caught Carrico, and they're looking for you. They mustn't see you, Ben. They've gone wild. Carrico didn't have anything to do with this. Neither did I. Oh, I believe you, Ben, but they won't. They'll hang you. No, they won't. Don't do it, Ben. Don't try it. Hyah! Get up there! Where's the kid? We've got an extra rope. Let's find that kid. Will you go now, Ben? Please. For my sake too. They're coming. All right, I'll go. But what am I gonna do about you, Zoe? I can't leave you here. I'll wait. No matter how long it is, I'll wait. You've waited long enough. I don't want you to wait any longer. Don't worry about me, Ben. Just come back for me. Put a rope around his neck! ** They're waiting for you, Zoe. But let them wait a little. Yeah, killing work rounding up them steers. My saddle's wore clean out. So is mine. Uh, any mail, Luke? Well, let me see. One for you, Ted. Package for you, Johnny. Hey, that's the ointment I sent for. Well, here's something for Ben Martin. Smells like a bill. Nothing for you other boys. It is... from the blacksmith. You ain't had one of those perfume kind in months, Ben. I know. Wait a minute, Luke. I... I think I'll be moving along. Then you'll be wanting your pay. That's right. Going home? Well, you might call it that. Hate to lose you, Ben. Don't know how we're ever gonna get the West settled... if you young bucks won't sit still in one place. I've got to settle something more important first. Thanks, Luke. I'll pick up my stuff at the bunkhouse. I'd like a ticket on the stage for Galena. No stage outta here for a couple of days. If you're in a rush, get back on that train and take the steamer from Pierre. You'll be in Galena tomorrow night. - All aboard. - Same fare, and you get a boat ride. I don't like boats. Where's the nearest stable around here? I wanna buy a horse. Down the block. Thanks. Put that gun down. I'm here to help you. I don't need any help. Don't be ridiculous. Everybody needs help in this treacherous country. When I saw you riding out of town alone, I said to myself, "There goes a poor devil who needs a guide." Are we camping here for the night? It's a nice spot. Easy to defend. Put your hands up. You're not serious. My gun's in my saddle. Put that thing away. Say, um, we've got grub, haven't we? Well, enough for myself. I wasn't expecting to share it. Well, we'll manage somehow. Now you get some wood, and I'll rustle the chow. But what... Don't worry about a thing. Leave everything to me. When you're safe in Galena, you can pay me whatever you like. Hey. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Getting some grub. Mmm. Bacon. I'm mighty partial to it. Give me my stuff. I'll handle this. I'm just trying to be helpful. Then go get the wood. All right. Hey. How did you know I was going to Galena? My very dear friend, what kind of a guide would I be... if I didn't even know where you were going? You ought a turn in. Yeah. I'm going to. Just as soon as we clean up. Oh, leave all that to me. You got a hard ride ahead of you tomorrow. Say, what's your name anyway? How does "Rick Harper" sound to you? Sounds like you just made it up. Uh, mine's Ben Martin. I don't believe that either. Names don't matter, my friend. People don't remember 'em anyway. But faces... they never forget. Good night. I had a hunch you'd try that. That's the reason I tied your trigger down. How could I stand guard without my gun? Don't give me that. You and I know what you were after... my money belt. That's the most attractive thing about you, Ben. Oh, except our friendship. Well, our friendship's over. Hey, you're not gonna maroon me. Stay where you are. You scared my horse off. Then steal another. Why, I may have to. Ben, you're encouraging crime! Hey, Ben! Look, pal. No gun. Hey, I took your advice. How do you like him? What do you want? I think we'd make a great team. I've got the charm. You've got the know-how. That trick with the pistol showed real genius. Uh-huh. Any other reason? Sure. I'm broke and you're not. Uh, you'd better stay on that horse you stole. I don't team up with thieves. That's a pretty choosy remark... coming from someone who's wanted for murder. Hey, my letters. The gal who wrote these seems to think you're innocent. Are you? So you're gonna blackmail me too. Oh, Ben. You're a poor judge of character. Would I be giving 'em back to you if I wanted to blackmail you? You ought a thank your stars they didn't fall into completely dishonest hands. You said you were a guide. How far is Galena? Twice as far as the way you're going. The shortcut's that way. Mm-hmm. All right, you're on. But only as far as Galena. From then on, you're on your own. It's a deal. You see, it doesn't take much to make me happy. I'm so glad you feel like that because you're not getting much. Let's go. On second thought, the other way's shorter. Come on. They'll hang us both. But I didn't steal anything. - You wanna argue with 'em? - Hyah! Bad odds. It's a miserable country. Infested with decent citizens. You got any ideas? I don't think I'll need a guide anymore. Good-bye. Not that, Ben. You'll drown. Be careful of the money! I can't swim. Well, hang on to me. Hey, get your hands off my money belt. What are you trying to do? I just wanted to see if it was still there. Don't let me go, Ben! Hard over. We'll pick 'em up. Half on engines. Much obliged. Resume speed. Yes, sir. What was all the shooting about? They were road agents. After his money. Haven't I seen you someplace before? Possibly aboard this boat? No, no. Not me. I'm a mountain man myself. Wyoming. Big rancher. You've heard of Martin's Lazy "M," haven't you? Oh, sure, you have. This is Mr. Martin. Martin. How do you do? I guess I was mistaken. Any place I can dry off? What he means is we'd like to look at the deluxe staterooms. Afterwards, he'll make a donation to the crew. Very well. Top deck for these gentlemen. Oh, I almost forgot, Captain. This is Mr. Harper. My groom. Put him up with the crew. Crew room's aft. Behind the boiler room. Who's there? Your groom. Fresh from the delights of the boiler room. I thought there was some regulation... about riffraff mixing with the first-class passengers. Well, I can look, can't I? Just wanted to see how the swells live. Not bad. Not bad at all. Isn't this a little steep on our budget? Thank you, Chang. - Lunch is served. - Lunch! I reserve your table, Mr. Martin. Please do. On the shady side. Yes, sir. You don't miss a bet, do you? That's a duty of a guide, Ben. I have to keep my eyes on you. Mm-hmm. Well, I can't get lost between here and the dining room. No, but I can. Shall we dine? Hey, didn't you forget something? Where's the little old belt? Oh, it's just a precaution. I put it in the captain's safe. In the captain's safe? Hey, you never can tell about those captains. I knew a captain once who was a crook. On a bigger boat than this! Have no fear, Harper, my lad. ** You know, it's a good thing they got a cargo boom on this boat. They're gonna need one to get you out of the chair. Flag the waiter. I wanna take a look at the pie department. On second thought, I don't think the boom do it. Well, Colonel Swope. Welcome aboard. You got on at Pierre, didn't you? Yes. I went straight to bed. Oh, uh, Captain, may I present my nieces? The Mrs. Dal-Marie Smith... Mrs. Smith. And, uh, Vanilla Bissell. Miss Bissell. I'll take Vanilla. Mr. Gassowary, and, uh, Mr. Brand Comfort. What are ya trying to do... spit on those lovely creatures? Brand Comfort. I knew your brother, Matt, well. You raise horses, don't you? Yes. I'm still running the ranch. Best horse flesh in three states. And here's to the man that raises them, my long-time friend, Brand Comfort. All right, back! Back up! Go back. Line up in the center. Backs to the table. Drop your hardware. Ladies too. Bring her over against the bank. I suppose you know that explosion was the safe blowing up. I don't wanna talk about it. If you'd let me rob you in the first place, we wouldn't be in this fix. I saw that. Duck! Somebody stop 'em! Stay where you are. Wait for me. Ben! Well, we got one of 'em anyhow. This'll be great news for the marshal. Hold on. He's no pirate. He lost as much money as any of you. Ask the captain. Mr. Martin's money was in the safe along with the gold shipment. He did everything he could to stop them. You saw him, Van. Oh, they were both wonderful. What was the idea of the mask? I was gonna trail 'em and see if I could get our money back. Oh. Wasn't such a good idea, was it? Well, I'd say it was a good try anyhow. We owe you a vote of thanks, young man. Well, I'm sorry it didn't work, sir, but one of their buddies is over there. If you wake him up, maybe he'll give you their address. Go get him! You know, that gang sure made a great haul. The gold, a ton of jewels, the cash. What a fine precision team. Well, they really clipped me for everything I had. Which reminds me, I don't know what you're hanging around for. I can't even pay for this massage. Nobody's rushing you. Next best thing to money is friendship anyhow. Do you really mean that? I don't know. Sounded good. But it didn't sound like me. I've got a lot of enemies in Galena. I'm liable to need a friend. I'll bet Brand Comfort would have a fit if he knew you chopped his brother. Oh... Not that you did it, you understand. It was just a thought. You'd better read those letters Ag... Passengers have been working on pirate you catch, Mr. Martin. Mm-hmm. Well, what's happened? He no talk. Captain, he wire ahead to Marshal Sommers. Uh, where? Next stop... Galena. Marshal, he make him talk. Put it over there. Yes, sir. Man, you look like all your rabbits died. Is it the marshal that's bothering you? He'll investigate everybody. He'll recognize me for sure. I think maybe not. No. You don't know that bird. Remember what you said about never forgetting a face? He's the guy that invented the idea. Exactly my point. He doesn't have to see your face. Marshal, I've got all the passengers in here, and the crew is waiting in their quarters. Good. Where's the prisoner? Below decks, well battened down. I'll get to him next. Oh, hello, Brand. Rough passage? Plenty rough. On the pocketbook. Now, folks, just a few questions. What do you got there? Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, no, you don't. Hold it. Just stay where you are. Marshal? Marshal! Yes, Wade? They got somebody under the blanket there. Who is it? One of the heroes of the raid, Marshal. Well, let's take a look. No, no, no, no. He's in a coma. Is that Mr. Martin? He's had a relapse. I am taking him to the hotel and call a doctor. And you should. Mr. Martin risked his life for us, Marshal. If there's anything I can do for you and your friend, be sure and call on me. Thank you, sir. Maybe we will. See that the casualty gets to the hotel. Yes, sir. Not you. You may have some questions to answer. Everybody inside. Hey. We got away with it, thanks to Comfort. But that marshal's bound to show up sooner or later. Well, how much later? I came a long way to see somebody. I wish I could talk you out of it. But you're so dead set that I might as well give you the good news. Good news? Yeah. What kind of good news? The marshal's taking the boat to Fort Benton with the pirate you walloped. For how long? Overnight. That's gonna give me enough time to get this settled. Let's go. ** All bets in. All right, folks. Here she goes. Double "O," the winner. Double "O." All right, folks. Pay the line. He's coming out. Watch your hands, lady. You see anything? No. She's not here. Well, gals are like cats, Ben. If you leave one behind, it's liable not to be there when you get back. You ought a count your blessings and go bareheaded. I'd have a drink on that except drinks cost money. All right, he's coming out. Watch your hands, lady. Order us a couple. So you're a sneak. Magic boots. Well, happy days! Send us a matched pair of straight whiskeys, my friend. Cheer up, Ben. The next best thing to finding a gal... is a loyal buddy to drown your sorrows with. - Maybe you're right. - ** I'd like to make sure first. * Ay, ay, ay, ay * I once fell in love with a gypsy * It's her. Star of the show. * Who danced with a flame in his shoe * * Made me believe that he loved me * * Made me sad, made me happy too * * That gypsy with the fire in his shoe * * I was a fool to believe him * * Love makes a fool out of you * * Don't give your heart to a gypsy * * If he dances so well the stars can tell * * That he has fire in his shoe * * He must dance I know it well * * But I love him so * Ay, why can't he dance for me? * * Oh, why must he go? * Oh, oh * So don't trust a fellow named Chico * * If he throws a red rose to you * * The one that he gave me is faded * * But those dark, flashing eyes They burn so bright * * Just like the fire in his shoes * * Ay, ay, ay, ay * Just like the fire * In his shoes * Hello, Zoe. Have fun, honey. Ben. I thought you'd forgotten me. I thought you were one of the customers. You've changed so. Bigger, better, but the same Ben. You've changed too. If you'll excuse me, I'll mosey around a little. Why didn't you answer my letters? You had me worried. Come on, Zoe! How about "Happy-go-lucky"? I've got to go on again, Ben. Wait for me. Up we go. Zoe. * There was * Long, lean Laramie Will * * Took me walking over the hill * * When he asked was I faithful * * Could I tell a lie? * Happy-go-lucky am I * There was * Big, bad Ben from Cheyenne * * Tried to be my man among men * * Bet he thinks I'm a birdie * * The way I did fly * Happy-go-lucky am I * I'm like a bee * Among the flowers * So busy buzzing as spring has sprung * * I'll be a bee * And buzz for hours * I'll do the stinging before I'm stung * * 'Cause * A matrimonial eye * Starts my feet a-wavin' bye-bye * * There'll be no double harness that I can't untie * * Happy-go-lucky am I * Bye-bye * Happy-go-lucky am I * Bye-bye * Happy-go-lucky... * Who cheated who? Better put that away. He won't pay off. I don't know what all the fuss is about. I gave him an I.O.U. It's worthless. He hasn't a penny. Is that true? Of course. If I had any money, I wouldn't have written it. Sounds like a reasonable explanation. At any rate, what you lack in ethics, you more than make up in marksmanship. You should see me when I'm not nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about, Mr. Harper. I'll sit in for you. I hope you know what you're doing. Uh, of course, if you gentlemen object... Can I see the color of your coin? Try your other boot. Watch your hands, lady. He threw a six. He likes the hard way. This should cover his play. - All right, coming out. - ** He threw a seven. Seven is the winner. One hand showdown for everything in the pot, including Mr. Harper's I.O.U. Go ahead. Place your bets, please. Once more, please. Slow start, fast finish. Would you like to go again? Uh, no, thank you, gentlemen. I've got some business to attend to. Well, there's a bright new star in the gambling sky. Say, you ought to do this more often. I only did it to get you out of a mess. Say, speaking of a mess, I think you're walking into one yourself. How do you stand with her? I still got to find out. I wish you would settle down to a life of crime... and forget these distractions. The world is ours. Another town, another poker game, a handy bank to be cracked. Now, what do you say? I'll tell you in a few moments. But just to be on the safe side, buy us a couple of horses. Now you're talking. I'd like to see Miss Fontaine. Come in, Mr. Martin. Leave us, Vi. Well... I see you won. Yes. I wanted to return this to Miss Fontaine. I'll save you a lot of bother. I'll tell her you brought it back. Pretty, isn't it? Expensive too. I consider it a rather good investment. I suppose it is. Is she here? I want to see her. I'm afraid that's not possible. Why? Because she doesn't wish to see you. Is that her idea or yours? Let's say we agreed it would be best this way. You see, Mr. Martin, she told me a little about you. I fully sympathize with your position. It's not an enviable one... being the old friend who comes back... to find things... slightly changed. You mean unwelcome. I didn't want to put it that bluntly. But as long as we understand each other, I have one further suggestion. Don't come back. I won't. Tell her I said good-bye. I already did. Hey! That was quick! I can tell by your face you got dry-gulched. I didn't even see her. I hope this isn't gonna interfere with our plans, Ben. Are those our horses? That they are. Pair of fast, loving animals. One for you, one for me. I hate to do this to you, Rick, but I'm gonna have to take my share now. Hey, you're not pulling out on me? I told you I had to get it settled, and it's not settled. How much time are you gonna waste on this silly affair? A lot more time than you got. Me? You're the one that's running out of time. You'll do a lot better without me anyway. Well, of all the ungrateful... So long, Rick. I hope they hang ya! Mr. Harper, were you thinking of leaving town? You bet I am. What's it to you? I've noticed you have some unusual characteristics, one of them being an aversion to money moving in any direction except towards you. You're right there. How would you like to keep it moving that way? Come up and have a drink. What are we waiting for? My key, please. Oh, there's a message here for you, Mr. Martin. Who brought this? I don't know. It was here when I came in. I won't need this. Who is it? You said you wanted to see me. Well, you look surprised. I know your note said tomorrow night. But being such old friends, I figured you could squeeze me in tonight. You didn't have to say that, Ben. What did you expect me to say? Say, he does all right for himself, doesn't he? And so do you. I don't blame you, Zoe. I blame myself for thinking it might have been different. I kind of asked for it, didn't I? I was hoping your mind had grown up with the rest of you. I haven't had the advantages you've had. Anyway, let's have a drink to it. To all those dear, dead dreams. All right, Ben. If that's the way you want it. That's the way it is. I was gonna say this beats that cheap little ranch... we used to talk about. But there's something cheap about this too. You're wrong, Ben. You're so wrong. Have fun, honey. Hurry up. Get out. That's not a nice way to say good-bye. I didn't say good-bye. You did. I could've said a lot more, but I wasn't going to. Say anything you want. Think anything you want. Just get out of here. Well, why don't you go? 'Cause I don't want to. Not this way, I don't. Oh, Ben. I know it looks bad. I can't help how it looks. Forget it. It's none of my business. Ben, I don't love him. I said I don't blame you. It's a lot better than I can do. Maybe that's what hurts. He's got a price in his pocket, and I've got it on my head. You think that's the difference, don't you? Well, isn't it? No. Everything's just as it was, Ben, unless you want to make it different. I was hoping you'd say that. But it's not that easy. They're still looking for Ben Matthews, remember? Let them look. You can't clear your name in this town, Ben. They'll kill you first. There's only one way... run and don't look back. This time, you won't go alone. You know what you're giving up? Nothing. Some furniture and a man with too much ambition. You don't know him, Ben. He's beat everybody, even the law. A café owner? A café owner that's gone every time there's a boat raid. Don't let him beat us, Ben. Do it my way, please. There doesn't seem to be any other way. When can you go? Tomorrow after the last show. He's going upriver, and I'll meet you here. And be careful. Please be careful. Excuse me. What are you doing here? I decided to hang around, try an honest job. Mr. Boucher's compliments, Miss Fontaine. And shouldn't you be in bed? I don't understand. I do. He's working for Boucher. I'll tell you how it is, Ben. You had a mighty small welcome when you came here, and it shrunk. Now, Mr. Boucher has a special way all his own of dealing with pests. But I put in a good word for you. At the risk of my job, I told him you'd leave peaceable. Now, will ya? I thought he was your friend. Not at the moment. Come on, Ben. This is for your own good. They're gonna run you out of town anyhow. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Now, let's go. Good night, Zoe. I didn't realize Miss Fontaine was entertaining tonight. The show is over, and I'm just leaving. Just a minute. Let him go, Andre. I told him he wasn't welcome. He was told that before. I wanted to find out for myself. What did you find out? Just like the lady says. I'm not wanted here. And you never were. And you never should have come here. You just caused me to be embarrassed. I wish you'd go before you make any more trouble. You heard. You don't take hints very well, do you? Now get up and get out! Clean up the yard. Yes. Can I help you? Mr. Martin's still here. Yes. Uh, is anything wrong? No. Just overstayed his welcome. Tell him you want his room. Well, I can't do that... Now. Yes. Just a minute. Yes? Mr. Martin, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Well, why? I'm paid up till tonight. I'm sorry, but you gotta go. I'll give you the money back on your room. Keep the change. I'll be out in a minute. How's business? Great. Turning 'em away every day. Mr. Comfort. If it isn't my old shipmate from the pirate raid... Mr. Martin. You told me to look you up. Remember, sir? Well, I'm glad you did. Gif, you'd better take care of Mr. Martin's horse. Gif will fix him up. Out here we're mighty gentle with horses, Mr. Martin. You seem to have ridden yours pretty hard. I've had to. If you can spare me some time, I'd like to tell you about it. Why, of course. Come on in. You never got a line on those pirates, did you? Well, that's what I want to talk to you about, sir. I think I have. Have a look around, son. I do a bit of collecting, as you can see. So I heard... from your brother. My brother? I didn't know you knew him. When was that? I was on the boat the night he was killed. Three years ago. Thing I remember most about him was he was a fair man. You have a good memory. I don't think I'll ever forget that night. And I'm sure you haven't. No. It's not a thing anybody around here is liable to forget. But I wish they would. Sit down, son. Thank you. Matt was a big loss to me, and a lot of me died with him. Perhaps I'm being selfish, but I've had my share of painful memories. And all the talk in the world isn't gonna bring my brother back. So why don't we talk about pirates and forget the past? I don't think we can, Mr. Comfort. Why is that, Ben? They're one in the same. I better tell you who I am. Unless you've already guessed. They were looking for some boy at the time. An accomplice of the gambler. That couldn't be you, could it? It could. And you could go to the marshal and tell him, but I don't think you will. You apparently think I'm as fair as my brother. If I didn't, I wouldn't be telling you this. Just what is it you're telling me... that you're innocent? I'll let you and the law decide that, but you got to hear me through first. This may come as a surprise to you, Mr. Comfort, but the same gang that's been raiding the boats killed your brother. And the man behind it all is Andre Boucher. Boucher? That's right. But I know it's hard for you to believe. Yes. It is a little difficult to imagine. I've known him for years. But you don't know him with a mask on, and the man that killed your brother wore a mask. And he had another trademark... a silver-studded belt. I got it full in the face that night on the boat, and last night I got it again from Boucher. I think you're off someplace, Ben. Even granting the raids, what possible motive would Boucher have had for killing Matt? There's no connection. But there is a connection... What's the matter? That wooden Indian. Where'd you get it? Mmm, I don't recall. Bought it someplace. Why? There was a wooden Indian in your brother's stateroom. Well, I'm sure it wasn't that one. I hate to disagree with you, Mr. Comfort, but I'm sure it was. There was a chipped spot on its lip, and it's still here. Only somebody's been trying to cover it up. And, uh, I'm afraid I don't follow you. I don't think you bought this Indian. Well, you-you make this sound like a crime. Certainly, you're not asking me to account for that Indian... I think you'd better account for the Indian, Mr. Comfort. It doesn't belong in an innocent man's house. That's the same one Boucher stole from your brother. Next thing you'll be saying Boucher and I are partners. I'm disappointed in you, Ben. You're not much of a sleuth. Then suppose we get a better one. We'll go see the marshal. Don't be ridiculous. Get up, Mr. Comfort. I've got another idea. I'm gonna prove you and Boucher are working hand-in-hand. We'll start with your safe. What do you expect to find in there? Whatever it is you're trying to hide. Hurry up. Let me see those papers. Drop it. Over by the fireplace. This man's wanted for murder, Gif. How's the other one? For the moment, out of business. Alive or dead, Ben, you don't seem to know who your friends are. I do now. Thanks for dropping in, Mr. Harper. Don't mention it. You know, you cost me a job. Boucher don't keep men on who can't hold their own. You held your own here. I figured you needed a hand when I saw those two hyenas trailing ya. Wait a minute. I don't know how you feel, but I got an itchy finger. What do you think of the old geezer's safe? I think we ought a air it out. Well, that's more like it. There's something special I want in there. Ben, there's something special about every safe... money. I'm a little rusty at this, but it'll come back to me. Boucher and the law! The chair! No! This is no place for a choirboy! Rick, you'll never make it! Meet me in St. Louis! Rick! ** * And soon your heart will heal * * It would be heaven * To have and hold you * Give me your love * My dear * Give me your love * My dear * Vi, I'd like to rest a little. Come back later. I know what happened, Ben. I should have listened to you, Zoe, and left well enough alone. It didn't prove anything, did it? And now someone else has got the proof, and I've got the law after me again. And they're hunting Rick. Hunting him because he killed a crook to save my life. Oh, Ben, I told you how they were... Boucher and all of them. Let's do what we said we were going to do before it's too late. I'll get you some coffee. I can use some. Ben, see these valises? They're going on the boat tonight, and I'm going with them. Where? Wherever you're going to meet me. All right. Wait for me at the hotel in Pierre. And we'll make it this time. You'll see. They're back. Hurry, Ben. Here comes Boucher. No luck? He's in the neighborhood. We'll get him yet. I have a feeling that this town would be much better off without you, Mr. Harper. Well, why don't we give it a trial separation and see? I'm willing. What do you plan to do with him? Lock him up. The marshal's coming in on the boat. He'll settle it. I know a quicker way to settle it. Why not? He killed Brand Comfort in cold blood! We got the makings of a trial just amongst us. Keep your distance! Why don't they string him up? Yeah. There seems to be a crying need for justice around here. We're rather short of time. Perhaps if we lit a bonfire on the dock, it would delay the boat. The rest is up to you. Come on. Let's get that wharf burning. Yeah. That'll keep the marshal from landing. Let's go get him. Go get him. This is it. Everything from Brand Comfort's safe. The other one got away. That's too bad. I know you sort of counted on a double hanging. He knows about these papers. He's just fool enough to go to the marshal. I don't think that will do him any good if you burn them. You don't know much about the law, do you? If they suspect you, it's like a fire. Once started, it's difficult to put out. I don't want him talking. We're going out again. This time, we'll get him. Get the horses ready. Get away from that fire. Steer away and keep clear. We'll put her in downstream. Let's go. Hold it down there! Make 'em stop, or I'll shoot. Hurry up. How do you know I'm that persuasive? For your sake, you better be. - - Get away from those horses! Zoe, get a hold of 'em! All right, Boucher, talk. This man has a gun in my back. I don't doubt that he knows how to use it, because he's used it before... three years ago to murder Matt Comfort. Tell 'em the truth! Today, he and the man you're about to hang murdered Matt Comfort's brother. I warned you! He wants me to stop this hanging. He says if I don't, he's gonna kill me. That doesn't leave me much choice, does it? Tell us what to do, Boucher. I'll tell you what to do! Cut the rope, or you'll all answer for this hanging! There's not gonna be any hanging! Get that man down. Who's your friend, Boucher? A gunman wanted for murder. It's the other way around, Marshal. You remember the incident the night that Matt Comfort was murdered? Yes. And I remember you too. Ben something. Ben Matthews. And I've got the proof that Boucher and Matt's brother were partners in the boat raids. What do you say to this, Boucher? Nothing, except that he's lying. Suppose we find out. I suggest that both of you come down here and we'll talk it over. Any objections? None whatever. I'll be waiting right here. Cover the back of the saloon. If you don't mind. I'll take your gun, Matthews. Ah, well armed. That's health insurance in this town, Marshal. And who do we have here? The last of the Harpers. Thanks to you, Mr. Matthews. Both of you men are under arrest. We'll have a hearing with Mr. Boucher present. You wanted to speak to me, Marshal? I heard some odd stories about you when I was upriver... from a man who worked for you. He was one of the pirates on the last raid. Yes. And a very good one too. You don't deny it then? Why should I? The chips seem to be down, Marshal. As you see, I'm wounded. Any discussion of my past... will be as useless as discussing my future. Whatever you don't know about my activities, I'm sure you'll find in those documents. Meanwhile... I'd like to buy you all a drink. I'm sorry to cheat you out of a hanging. It would have been a stylish one. Just as I promised you, Zoe. Better luck next... You're a bad liar, Gif. Yeah, I know it. He's also a bad shot. That ain't no crime. In your case it is. Wade. Yes, Marshal? Jail him. He turned out to be a pretty good witness for you. But your best witness was Matt Comfort. He trusted you, son. I know. Too bad he trusted his brother. If he hadn't, Matt might have looked in that wooden Indian. They couldn't have picked a better place to hide the gold that night. Or a more honest man to smuggle for them. Good-bye, Ben. Thanks, Marshal. Marshal, I want to take my hat off to you. You're a monument to justice. Believe me. You're quite a fancier of other people's horses, aren't you? Me? Oh, Marshal, that's a terrible thing to say about a man. I'm gonna give you about 15 seconds... to get out of town and never come back. One... Well, Ben, I guess you don't need a guide anymore. He's got one. Uh, pay us a visit... after we get the locks on the doors. Ten... I got a fast ride ahead of me. Time's up. So long, Rick. So long, Ben! Good-bye, Rick! Say, he didn't have a horse. He's got one now. Yeah. Mine. No charges, Marshal.
