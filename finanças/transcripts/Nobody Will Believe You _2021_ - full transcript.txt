Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom? Mom? Mom! Where are you? Mom? Help me, please help me. Help me. Help! Please! I can... they can help you. Knock, knock. You scared me. I got the place. Really? Mom, oh, congratulations! Thank you. Yes, finally. - I am so excited. - Yes, it's amazing. - Can I see it? - Yes! - Okay. - Wow. So, imagine. It's awesome. All of the rooms out the back are already divided up, so I won't have to do much renovating. I'm just gonna set a few things up, fresh paint job. Oh, and check out the best part. - Hm? - Awesome. Yeah, the law offices left it, but I think it will fit in nicely here. So I can stop by and get a massage whenever I want from a cute Swedish guy? Mm-hm, sure. Whenever you want. For only 89 bucks. This is perfect. Have you decided on a logo yet? Actually, I was hoping that you could design the logo and the sign. Seriously? You're an amazing artist, Hannah. Thanks, mom. It's about time you had a big success. - You deserve it. - Yeah. Excuse me, hey, uh, where's hall 7c? Anyway, the roster already looks really good and I'm not worried about the JV team. - Oh. - Oh! - Sorry. - Hi, no, are you okay? Yeah, I, um, do you know where hall 7c is? - Uh, Tanner. - What? - Check this out. - Okay. It's the piano room, right? Yeah. Uh, just to the left. Thank you. You're playing for Kurtz? Oh, boy. Good luck. What does that mean? You'll see. Okay. Thank you. So your fond hope is to go to Juilliard? There's no way I could afford Juilliard. Actually, I'd have to be good enough to get on scholarship. Do you have any idea how much work it would take to get you there? Honestly, no. But I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Okay, to start with, you're gonna have to take choir music theory. And then begin your one-on-one tutoring after school. Does that mean you'll accept me into the intensive program? I've heard worse. Thank you. All right, go, sit down. Next! Hey, guys. Hey, can I sit here? Sorry, my friend's gonna sit there. Okay. - Hey, guys. - Uh, sorry, that seat's taken. - Sorry. - Okay. Hi. Why are you eating over here? I'm sorry, I'm new, I don't really know anyone and I couldn't find anywhere to sit. - But I'm finishing up... - No, no, no, it's okay. I wasn't trying to give you a hard time. You played beautifully, by the way. Earlier at the piano. Oh. I'm no musical expert, but I thought it sounded phenomenal. Thanks. It's Hannah, right? I'm Garrett, Mr. Williams, the guidance counselor. Oh, hey, it's nice to meet you. Hey, look, I know the first day can be kind of tough and some of the kids here can be pretty intimidating, but there's a place for you here. You'll figure it out. And my door's always open if you ever wanna talk. I appreciate that. - Thank you. - Sure. Oh, Hannah, don't forget this. And good luck with Mr. Kurtz, huh? What? Anybody here? Hello? What... okay. Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Green for the front and turquoise for the back. And I really want to try and get the painters in sooner rather than later. We really don't want a lot of paint fumes for the grand... Okay, great work. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Huh. Your day was that great, huh? It was whatever. This school's got a really good piano. Anything you want to talk about? Sounds like opening a spa is much more fun than finishing high school. Well, graduating high school was step one. Okay. New plan. What? How 'bout some Mac and cheese? Right now? There's no time like the present. Okay. So, what do you got so far? Mm. All right, so, it should be, uh, happy and relaxing. Mm-hm. But also clear and memorable. - Mm-hm. - I'm not sure if you want, like, a tropical theme. Oh, wow. Or like an undersea theme or what. But this is just some of the stuff I've been working on. Oh, I love the lotus flower. - Yeah? - Yeah. I've been working on, like, a lotus flower-sunset combination. This one's my favorite. Oh, Hannah, that is beautiful. I love that. What about the sign? I'm still working on it. Okay. Is it gonna light up? Hm. Light up, flashing neon, whatever you want. Flashing neon. Oh, well, I want it to be noticeable from anywhere in the Plaza. I have a feeling that sign is going to be one of our biggest money makers. Oh, well, I am going to go and settle up the bill. Wait, wait. Definitely a moment worth celebrating. Well, I have been hogging all of the conversation. I wanna hear all about your first day. Did you make any new friends at school? Yeah, I think I met some pretty cool people. Oh. Oh, I am so happy to hear that. One of my sisters try to wear something like that out of the house, my father would have called her a tramp. - Get out of my room. - What do you call yourself, huh? You know, we've talked about this and you are way too young to be spending the night out with some boy, I forbid it. You're not my real dad and I don't care what you think. Is it an older guy, huh? Some creep pervin' on you? Mind your own damn business. You're grounded, Amber. You're on lockdown until I say otherwise. And if this boy thinks that he can spend the night out with you, let's see how he likes dealing with the cops. You know, when your mother's at work, I make the rules around here, Amber. If you wanna start being treated like a grownup, you need to start acting like one. Amber. Amber, open up. I mean it. Shane, dammit, Shane, I keep finding you girls and you keep losing them? I thought she was the one. I thought I could trust her. Is that you, Amber? Might as well come in here. You know you're gonna get a talking to. Hey, shut up already. Glad to see you survived the day. Yeah. Kurtz really tried to grind us into the floor at choir practice. I wonder if he got into teaching just to be a sadist. Kurtz isn't that bad. What? He just acts tough to whip us into shape I think. I just wish I didn't have to protect my voice. I'm dying for a smoke, you know what I mean? I don't really smoke. Oh. So what do you like to do to cut loose? Still trying to figure that out. Actually, there's kind of a lot of things I haven't done yet. Like what? Like, I don't know, go to a real party with like booze and dancing and bonfires. Or like make out with someone who makes me desperately hungry. Or drive a really fast car. I know it's stupid. Nah, it's not stupid. I've done all that stuff and I'm still restless. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh yeah. I keep feeling like I'm coming out of an awful dream. We moved here after my parents divorced. Mm. My mom's cool now, but it was messy. Actually, that's when I got really good at piano. Yeah, I remember my mom's first divorce. Totally sucked. Right? - Can mess you up. - Oh yeah. I'm afraid of taking up too much space, but I'm also afraid of disappearing from the world. You're not, you know? - What? - Taking up too much space. And you're not disappearing either. Come on, everyone notices you. - No. - That's why Amber is so vicious. She's jealous and scared and you're way more fun to pay attention to. And she dies without attention, so... What? What? Oh, come on, that isn't fair. How do people do this? All right, there has to be a good one in there somewhere. This is the best homework ever. Josh, measure 64, you were flat. Everyone else, thank you so much. Have a good day, see you tomorrow. So, I think I might try out for the cheer squad. A rah-rah, sis boom bah! Oh my god, you're serious? Yeah. What's the big deal? You wanna be a cheerleader? Kinda, yeah. I mean, I don't know, I wanna dance and make more friends and, I don't know, do something different. Brain-dead definitely counts as different. Come on, the only reason people like Amber don't get along with people like us is because we don't understand each other. Oh, she's so misunderstood. - Stop. - Amber and her friends are the girls that grew up rooting for the mean, rich, popular girls in movies. They're not misunderstood, they're toxic. I'm just tired of being nothing but the music nerd, okay? You don't have to go with me or anything. Seriously? Careful. Okay. All right, you guys, Jillian's gonna show you some moves. Try to incorporate them into your tryouts. And remember, smiles. I didn't know you were still interested in dance. It's not only the dancing. I wanna get out of my comfort zone, explore something new. Well, if it makes you happy, then I think that's great. Break a leg. Six, seven, eight. Come on, let me see smiles. You're here to get the crowd pumped, right? All right. Do you want to show 'em one more time? Yeah, I'll show 'em again, but you guys have to stretch. Okay, last but not least, we wanna see your moves. Um, start behind the line, and when the music stops, land in front of the line and give it a big finish, okay? Um, let's see. Emily. Go ahead. I... I can't do this. No guts, no glory. Who's next? Uh, you, Anna. Uh, it's Hannah, actually. Okay, Hannah actually. Let's see what you've got. And big finish! - Did you get it? - Perfect, I got it all - in super slow motion. - Send it to me. Oh, I'm sorry. We actually don't have any spots on the cheer squad right now. We just needed a new fail video for our social media. All right. #cheerleaderfail. #pigslop. #sad. Oh. Hello, hello. Hi, mom. So, how were tryouts? Fine, I guess. I'm not really sure if I wanna be on the squad. I think I should just focus on piano. Hm, well, that is the Hannah I know. Oh, hey, could you please help me unload those. Yeah. I... I know I can get it right. I'm sorry. Hey, that's... yeah, that's enough practice for today. No, I... No, I... it doesn't really hurt. We can keep going. No, if we stop now, you'll be fresh tomorrow. It's okay. I want to keep going. I want to get it right. Okay. You waiting on somebody? I think someone's following me. Okay, well, here, we can come and wait in my office if you want. You wanna call your mom, maybe get you a ride? Okay, yeah. Yes, ma'am. She's right here. Yeah, she's fine. Your mother is on the way. You wanna talk, tell me about anything? I don't feel like talking. It's just... It's what? I... I didn't even want to be a cheerleader, I just wanted to try something different. You're talking about Amber, the girls on the cheer squad. Yeah, I mean, it's crazy how much they hate me. I mean, I don't hate them. Why do they love torturing me? I heard about their prank. And then what about Tanner? I mean, is he really a nice guy or is he just another trick? I mean, everybody loved my dad, but that didn't stop him from dumping my mom so he could run off to Florida. And is it supposed to count as good parenting if he just writes you a check every month? And I know my mom, she puts on a good front, like, but it's like she thinks she always has to be happy in order to protect me from reality. And... and then now I think I have a stalker. And I have too much piano practice to do and I... I can't even take a breath. Wow. Sounds like you got a lot on your plate. - I'm sorry. - For what? Hannah, you have nothing to apologize for. I know it sounds corny, but it's okay to feel your feelings. Are you just gonna tell me everything's gonna be okay? 'Cause it's not. Everything's messed up. No, I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna try to listen. But I feel like you probably hate the idea of counseling anyway, don't you? Yeah. Kind of. I just feel like I need to figure it out for myself, you know? Feels weird talking about it. I mean, no offense. I get it. None taken. How 'bout this? Instead of thinking of me as Mr. Williams, the guidance counselor, what if you think of me as a dad that wants to hire you to tutor his daughter in piano? Tutor, like... Like a part-time job? Yeah, just twice a week. Katie is eight years old, she loves music, and she is endlessly curious. Plus, I know you'd make a great teacher. You pay attention, you're compassionate. I don't know. I mean, that sounds... Come on, ask your mom. I'd pay you something fair, so it'd be good pocket money. Plus, you know, give you a chance to take your mind off things for a bit. Yeah. Maybe. I'm gonna give you my personal cell, okay? We can work out the details of this whenever, but I want you to feel free to reach out. Call me or text me if any of this starts to feel overwhelming. Thanks, Mr. Williams. Yeah. Hey, you got a sec? Not if you're just gonna say, "I told you so." No, nothing like that. I... I wanted to say I'm sorry. What happened was really screwed up and you deserve better. Thanks. It was pretty embarrassing. So do you think she was, like, born evil or does she have to work so hard to make everyone so miserable? - Born. - Yeah. Hey, hey, watch out! - Are you good? - Yeah. Hey, are you okay? You just saved my life. I gotta be honest, I don't know why you did that. What... you think I did that? I didn't make the unit fall on you. No, no, I mean, I don't know why you pushed me out of the way. You saved me, and I've been treating you like... I bet nobody in the entire school would blame you if you just stood there and watched me die. No one deserves that. Seriously, thanks. Everything's been, uh, really messed up since my stepdad, he killed himself, and I... I don't know, maybe I just heard the wrong things about you. Apology accepted. Doesn't make much sense for us to hate each other, you know? I never hated you. It's not like that. Sometimes winning what you want means somebody else has to lose. It's not fair, but I'd rather win than lose. Amber, look at what just happened. I mean, we're better off if we look out for each other. I wish you were right. But, hey, um, I'm having a house party this weekend. Bonfire on the lakeshore and plenty of dancing, no parents. It's gonna be epic. You should come. Thanks. But, nah, I don't know. Tanner's gonna be there. Relax, he's not into me. He's too much of a goody two-shoes. Plus, I've got my own hot guy. Um, Jillian, text Hannah about the party. See you Saturday night? Yeah. Cool, thanks. Oh, where'd Zoey go? Who's Zoey? Never mind. Um, thanks again. Yeah. Hi there, uh, Mr. Williams? Oh, hey. Please, just call me Garrett. Nice to meet you. - Oh, you too. - Thanks for... Oh, uh, before I forget. - Oh, this is your spa. - Yes. This explains why you look so young. Oh. Oh, you're too kind. Well, Hannah mentioned you were hard at work on, uh, starting up a new business. Mm-hm, the grand opening is next week. You should stop by, treat yourself to a massage. I'm sure my wife is gonna love that. Anyways, thanks for meeting me. Oh, no problem. So, Hannah mentioned that you have asked her to tutor your daughter, Katie. For the record, I think it's a great idea. She could use a healthy distraction. I agree. So, uh, you see her at school. How is she doing? How is she really doing? She's studious. And I know it can be hard to fit in at a new school, but she's making friends. Oh, I am so glad to hear that. Still, though, I think things have been really tough. You know, all the teen drama, plus the pressure she puts on herself to be perfect at piano. Not to mention the divorce. Yes, uh, it hasn't been easy on her. Who likes being discarded? You know, I hired Hannah to teach Katie the piano, but, truth is, it'll be an opportunity for me to counsel her and let her vent. I think she'll feel a little better. Oh, uh, I think that could help. You seem uncertain. No, no. I think it's a good idea. I'm just... Hannah doesn't talk to me like she used to. She used to tell me everything. You know, I think she just needs space to grow. When she first came into my office, she didn't need my advice or problem solving. She just wanted to talk and let it out, have somebody listen. Well, I think we could all use a little bit more of that. Yeah. Bye, mom, love you. Love you too. Okay, I'll see you in a few hours. Okay. Oh, Hannah? Don't forget your raincoat. It might rain later. Thank you. Bye. Your house is lovely. Thank you. You look so familiar. I don't think we've met. No, I know, it's just that you remind me of younger days. Are you... you're not a cheerleader, are you? No, actually, I tried out for the team, but I didn't make it. Oh. I guess there is no point in dreaming about the past. I better go get my husband, I can take that. - Thanks. - Yeah. It was nice meeting you. You too. Hannah, I'm so glad you could make it. I've told Katie all about you. We even watched some videos of your recitals. Oh, gosh. Piano lady. I'm happy to meet you. Nice to meet you, lovely Katie. You can call me Hannah. I'll leave you to it. Okay. So, what kind of music do you like? Um... I can already play "chopsticks" and "twinkle, twinkle, little star." Oh, you can? That's pretty impressive. No, it's not. There are girls my age who can play Beethoven and Mozart and anything. But is that the kind of music you like? Mm-mm. Hm. You want to learn something from frozen? - Yeah. - Yeah? All right, let me teach you. Here we are. First we're going to learn the chord of C major. We're gonna look here and we're gonna start with one finger on C, the thumb right here. That's right, yes. And the next on E. Mm-hm, and then the pinkie's gonna go on G. Now try it all together, ready? Isn't that pretty? - Yeah. - Yeah? Wow, you're already a pro. It's like you already know what you're doing. Hey, nice rack. Of course it's the cheerleaders. They're usually the worst, but this is... This is way too far. I mean, hacking you? Sharing your private pictures? It's totally illegal. I promise I'll help you get revenge. Bloody, painful, delicious revenge. No, I don't want revenge. I just... I just want my life back. Gosh, my mom's gonna kill me. Your mom's nuts if she gets mad at you over this. You're the victim, Hannah. I don't wanna be the victim. I just meant it's not your fault. The invasion of privacy sucks, but it's over with. What's the worst that can happen now, right? Tanner. What? Oh, gosh, I gotta talk to Tanner. Bro. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, yeah, sure. Please tell me you deleted those pictures. Yeah, yeah, I deleted them. I promise. It was kind of weird you sent them in the first place. You know, my parents are always looking through my phone for stuff. No, I didn't send them, I mean, never to anyone. They were stored in my cloud, my phone auto-saves everything. I didn't realize... I gotta get to class, so... Wait. You're not gonna laugh at me with all your locker room buddies, are you? No way. Okay. I'll see you at the party this weekend. Yeah, about the party. You probably shouldn't go. I mean, those girls, they can be vicious to some girl who... Some girl who what? Well, look, I'm sure you're a nice person and all, you're just not the girl I thought you were. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Look, I know it sounds corny or whatever, but I've been saving myself for a good girl, you know, a nice girl. Somebody who shares my thoughts and shares my values. And now that everybody's seen those pictures of you, it's kind of ruined all that. Oh, so now I'm cheap and dirty to you? - Look, I just want... - No, get out! Go! Go. Geez. God. I am sorry that it's been such a rough day. Oh god, I can only imagine what you were going through. This is not your fault, baby girl. Everyone keeps saying that. I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout some Mac and cheese? No thanks. Hannah. Looks like you get to be the center of attention for one more day. Just leave me alone. Oh, you are definitely gonna be alone. You know what I think? I think you leaked your own photos as some sort of pathetic attempt to get people to notice you. Oh, and in case you want to go blaming me, I was at cheer practice this morning with a dozen witnesses. Alibis are important. Who did this? Who did this? So, how was school today? Fine. Well, the new sign looks great. I love your design. I think it helped bring in our first few customers. So do you want to hear about the grand opening? I've got to go do homework. You had nine months! Nine months, and you said nothing, so, no, you listen to me. This is not what I signed up for. You have a husband and a kid. Yeah, and I don't want to mess with that, okay? So, no, this is done completely, it's over. So no more texting, no more showing up at my house, no more calling me at wo... Hey, uh, I, um... I'm really sorry, but this is just... It's not working, so I wish you the best of luck, and I just can't get in the middle of it. I got to go. Sorry about that. I just feel like ignoring everything in the world except this piano. How about you? That sounds perfect. Hello! Hi, Garrett. It's nice to see you again. Wow, it looks great in here. - Thank you. - Hannah said you've been building up the business from scratch. Yeah, well, it turns out getting started is the easy part. The hard part is drumming up business. That's actually why I'm here. Look, I know I should wait and do a romantic getaway with Eleanor, but things have just been so stressful lately. Plus, I couldn't stop staring at this coupon. Well, treat yourself, huh? Yeah. What are you in the mood for? Well, I've got a couple hours before Eleanor's dinner comes out of the oven, so what do you recommend? Uh, a facial, manicure, pedicure, massage? Ooh, how about the works? Great choice. Oh, Jenny, could you get Garrett started, please? - Of course. - Thank you. - Hello, Jenny. - Hello. What are we getting done today? - Everything. - Everything. Hello? Hello? Garrett? Mrs. Williams? Katie? Anybody home? Oh, no. No. No. Oh! Oh, no! Yes, I... I need the police. I need an ambulance. Someone is hurt really bad. I think they're dead. No, no, no, I don't... I don't think it was an accident. Yes, poplar Avenue, please hurry. Oh, no. Katie. Katie, Katie, psst. Psst, Katie cat. Hey, Hannah? Uh, Hannah? Come on, we got to get you out of here, okay? What's going on? I need you to breath deep. Why? And I need you to close your eyes real tight and count to a hundred. Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, keep your eyes shut, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, uh-huh. Thirty-seven, uh-huh, 39, 40, 41. Oh, good job, 43, 44. Uh-huh, good job, you're good. Good job, you're good, you're good. - Inside the house. - Okay. - What's happening? - It's okay. - What's going on? - Okay. Come here, come here. It's okay. Hey, you're gonna be okay. I've got a 1-8-7 on-site. I repeat, I've got a 1-8-7 on-site. I think it may be a robbery. What's going on? Hannah, what's going on here? - Sir, I'm sorry. - You're sorry for what? - Sir. - No, no, I want to see my wife! - Sir, hold on! - Eleanor! Sir, hold on. - Sir. - I've got to see her. Hold on. I'm here at the scene of last night's gruesome tragedy. Police are now searching for a murder suspect in what appears to be a robbery gone wrong. Mr. Williams, I know this must be heartbreaking. What do you want us to know about your wife? Eleanor was the light of my life. I never could've imagined anything like this. Please, I beg you, we need justice for Eleanor. So are you just never gonna talk to me again? What happened? I mean, I've been trying to follow it all, but everyone is so full of lies and bs. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Fine, I guess if you don't care, I don't care. I didn't say I don't care. I said I don't want to talk about it. Everything is too much. Friendship is supposed to work both ways. Zoey, I'm sorry. You know what? Save it. Forget it. I'm the stupid one. Right here. Right, now go like this. Okay, now you try. Mm-hm. It's okay to be sad, you know? Music is good for that. Everything's changed. I don't want to play anymore. Okay. Give me a hug. Go on, you don't have to play. Before I forget... The money I owe you for tutoring. Don't worry about it, Mr. Garrett. It's not important. No, it's extremely important. You're the only stability in Katie's life. She needs that right now. I can only imagine what she's been going through. She's a trooper. She's actually been my motivation to keep going. But it's tough around here. There's so much Eleanor used to do. Do you need help with the dishes or, uh, making dinner or anything? You kn... Actually, no. You've been such a big help already. I feel bad asking you for anything else. We've been through a lot together. You can ask me for anything. I'll go crazy if this house becomes a shrine to Eleanor. I need to pack up her things sooner rather than later. I don't really want to do it alone. Do you think you could swing by on Sunday, help me sort through her stuff? Of course. You helped me through some hopeless moments. We can get through this together. Is that everything? Yeah. Wow. Wait a second. Is that... Hey, Mr. Kurtz! Was that Kurtz? That guy gives me the creeps. Why would he be watching the house? I don't know, I'll call the detectives. Keep an eye on Kurtz for your sake. Thanks. Hannah, you have to be careful. We don't know who we can trust, okay? I don't know what I'd do without you, Hannah. I'm glad we have each other. You're like the one really good thing in my life. Well, whatever happens with all of this, we've shared something together. I really learned from your trust and compassion. I just want to make you happy again. Would you do me a favor? Anything. I bought this for Eleanor ages ago, and she barely wore it, but I know that Ruby is your birthstone, and I just figured it made more sense to give it to you than to lock it away or sell it to some stranger. I don't... I don't know what to say. I mean, it's too much. No, come on, just hold on to it. You deserve a real thank you. See how it looks. Wow, I've never had a piece of jewelry like this before. It's gorgeous. I'm sorry. That was definitely inappropriate. I apologize, I'm just... I've been so raw and vulnerable since Eleanor's death. I haven't been myself. You've been a real hero for dealing with me. It's okay. Actually, I can't think of anyone else I'd rather kiss. Hannah... You're a sweet, wonderful person. Why don't you get some sleep? We can talk about this later after our minds have cleared. I don't want to rush things. Okay. Don't be so tough on yourself. Like you say, we all need a little support from time to time. - Hannah... - Yeah? Please don't tell anybody about this, okay? Some things are better left as secrets. Of course. I like sharing secrets with you. Bye. Not a ton, but I do know how to make spaghetti, which is probably pretty good. Oh, yes, this looks great. Oh, Hannah, I didn't hear you come in. Look who dropped by. - Hey. - Hey. How was Katie? Good. Sad, but good. Poor kid. Well, uh, dinner will be ready in about ten minutes. I already ate. I've got a lot of homework to do, so you guys go ahead without me. Is she doing okay? That's a stupid question. I just mean are things getting any better at least? I don't know, she hasn't said anything to me. Could you do me a favor? Could you keep an eye on her? - Like, spy on her? - No! No, no, no. You don't have to betray her confidence. Just... Look after her. Double-check that she's okay. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm glad that she's spending time with Katie and Garrett... But... It's a lot of emotions to handle. Just help make sure that she's not doing anything unwise. Yeah, I'll do my best. Thank you, Zoey. Afternoon. No tutoring today? Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's short notice, but I'm moving on. I took a job teaching at a school in new England. It's effective immediately. Wait, you're leaving town? Mr. Franks is gonna take over as your tutor. Hey, you've made a lot of great progress. All right, so I know you're gonna be great at your audition for Juilliard, so don't worry about it. No, so that's it? What do you want, hm? You want roses? A gold watch? A formal handwritten letter? What do you want? I want to know why you were snooping on me and Mr. Williams. It doesn't matter, okay? Believe me, Hannah. I was looking for an... I was looking for answers, but I don't have any of the answers that you want. But you know something? No, that is the point. I don't know anything. Good luck at your audition. - What's going on? - Hannah. - Sweetie... - What? - Zoey's been attacked. - What? She's okay, she's in the hospital. She's in stable condition, but it was pretty bad. That's terrible, we should go visit her. What? They had a warrant. Hannah, would you like to tell me where you got this? Uh, Garrett... Mr. Williams gave it to me. I see. Please have a seat. The problem, Hannah, is we spoke to Mr. Garrett and he says that the necklace went missing. "Stolen" is the word he used. I don't understand. It was a gift. He gave it to me. He says that you've been clinging to him, and ever since Eleanor's death you've been acting bizarre and obsessive. What? He never said that. He was worried that you may have stolen his wife's prized possession, and sure enough, we find it hidden in your closet. He gave it to me, it was a gift. No, I don't understand. Why would... why would he lie about that? Oh my god. Oh my god, what if he did it? What if he murdered his own wife? Hm, great performance, Hannah. Right on cue. Garrett was actually getting a massage at your mother's spa during the time of the murder, so he couldn't possibly have done it. But it wasn't me. Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Wait, no, we went over this. I helped him cook dinner one night. I used the knife to cut vegetables. Ah, well, when we checked your phone, we noticed certain text messages were missing, but Garrett still had a record of those messages. What messages? "I love you more than anything ever. You can't say 'no' to me. If I can't have your love, I'll kill myself." What? That was right after the murder, a couple days before you sent this one. "We're supposed to be together. It's destiny. Hannah and Garrett is written in the stars. I know you say I'm too young, but I'll never let anybody come between us." No, this is insane, I never wrote any of those messages. I promise, it wasn't me! What about the pictures? If you're not in love with him, why send him these pictures? I... I didn't send them to him. I mean, they got sent to everyone, but it wasn't me. My phone got hacked. Hm. The pictures, the necklace, the murder weapon, your obsession with the one man who showed you real kindness. That's not how it was. What type of person goes through everything in his house and throws away his wife's clothing? Frankly, I had a bad feeling about you from the get-go, but everyone seemed to tell me the same thing, "how could she have stabbed someone to death and been perfectly clean a few minutes later?" I... I didn't stab her. That's your raincoat, confirmed by pictures from your own social media. Mr. Williams' neighbor found it yesterday shoved in the bottom of his garbage covered in Eleanor's blood. This is ridiculous. Detective, my daughter has been through far too much already. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Hannah Baxter, you're under arrest for the murder of Eleanor Williams and the attempted murder of Zoey Jones. No, this is ridiculous. - Turn around, please. - Do not touch her! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do will be used against you in a court of law. Mom, I didn't do this, it wasn't me. You know that, right? It's okay, I'm going to get a lawyer. Please, no, I didn't do it, though, it's not me. I'm being set up! Mom, please! - Let her go. - I promise, please! Get your hands off her! This is not okay. Hey, Amber, uh, check this out. Like... I knew there was something wrong with her. What a freak. Yeah. I'll see you around. - Hannah. - I didn't do it. I know. Oh, honey, I know. I don't believe you would ever do something like this, not for a single second. I love you. I am going to support you through this. The truth will come out. Oh, come here. Oh my god. I can't believe this. Well, I guess I will deal with the police tomorrow. I don't even think there's any security cameras nearby. Who would do something like this? Who cares? Everything we try to create ends up broken anyways. Every friend ends up betraying us. Nothing ever works out. I'm not trying. We are not going to give up. We are not going to stop fighting. I am not going to let you quit just because things seem unfair right now. I'm going to prison, mom. My life is already over. No, it's not. We are going to focus on proving the truth. The police believe his story. And you saw them, they don't care that I'm innocent. I know things seem difficult right now, but this whole story about a love affair, come on, it's... it's absurd! You have the truth on your side. - Mom, he did kiss me. - What? I mean, I kissed him, we kissed. I thought I wanted to do more. It seemed so right, I'm sorry. Men like him know how to manipulate people. This is not your fault. But that's the thing. I wanted to be with him. There's no way they're gonna care that I'm innocent. Yes, they will, if we can find evidence that he is the one that killed her. How? You're his alibi, mom. You said he was right here at the time of the murder. Then he must have had an accomplice or he... I don't know, he... There has to be a loose end somewhere. Mr. Kurtz. Your piano teacher? What does he have to do with any of this? I don't know, but he might know something. I think he knew Eleanor. He had her picture like he loved her or something. And on the same day of the murder, I overheard a phone call with him, and I think he was breaking things off with someone. What if... What if he was having an affair with her? That's the kind of thing that makes people kill, right? Hi. Yeah, I'm watching him now. I don't know. It definitely looks like he's getting ready to leave. Okay, I'm gonna go in for a closer look. Don't worry, I will be careful. Ah! Hi. Here you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. Um... I, uh... I saw Eleanor on and off for about a year. She called herself Ellie. She never told me anything about her personal life. You know, part of me wondered if there was someone else, but she always had the free time, so I just didn't ask. She was, um... She was really lonely. Really grateful. How did you find out that she was married? She told me. She said that she was living with a monster, said that she had to escape. And I, I thought she was exaggerating. It just sounded really messy, you know, just too messy. And I didn't sign up to be involved with a married mom, so I just broke up with her. I told her to think about her kid. Less than a week later, she was dead. You have to go to the police. No, I... I can't. Don't you understand that? Like, I... I don't have any evidence that Garrett actually did anything wrong, and if he did, if he actually... If he killed his own wife, I don't think he would hesitate to kill me, or you, or Hannah. Please, if you think there's a chance that he did this, go to the police. Are you sure? Are you sure that he did this? What makes you so sure that he killed her? Because it is the only reason that he would've lied to Hannah. - He manipulated her. - No. He planned all of this. No, no. Hannah is actually involved in this. No. She is not. - You're sure? - Yes. Okay, um... Garrett, he still has that airtight alibi. I mean, he was with you. I know. I don't know. Theoretically, it is possible that he stopped by to kill Eleanor before he went to the spa. I don't think it would've taken long. Doesn't really sound like you're sure about anything. No, I, uh... I can't be listening to any of this. I'm getting out of here. I'm just gonna go as far as I can. I'm not supposed to be involved in this, I'm just not, I'm sorry. John, please, help me. I just need information. I don't have it. I don't have anything. All right, I barely know Garrett from school. Frankly, he seems like a nice guy. I do know that she has a sister. Emma. She lives in the city, in a loft. It's downtown. I think I have her number. He's a terrifying man. Please, I need your help. I need to prove that he did this. Eleanor was my little sister. She was 17 years old when she started dating Garrett. He was 31. - What? - Yeah. He was her guidance counselor when she was a varsity cheerleader. She thought the other students were bullying her, but it was all him. Gaslighting, mind games, grooming. He knew exactly how to play her. Oh my god. They officially started dating when she was 18. They got married and had Katie. Everyone decided it was all okay. He was controlling, abusive. He enjoyed being cruel to her and then being the nicest guy in the world to everyone else. He would tie her up, torment her, beat her. Anything to break her and control her. But he never broke her, not really. Not until he killed her. She was looking for a way out. She was terrified of what might happen to Katie. Here. She wrote it all down. It's all there, take it. Thank you. I don't know what to say, this is... This is a huge help. Melanie, no matter how much you want to protect your daughter, he won't stop. He will kill you. He will kill Hannah just to protect his secrets. You're in grave danger. This is Hannah's only chance. Hi, Katie. What are you doing here? I just came to say "hi" and talk to you for a second. Daddy says you took away mommy. Hey, no. You don't believe that, do you? I would never. Do you remember anything? Anything that happened the night before? Daddy stayed up late with me. We watched movies until midnight. That's why I had a nap after school. If I was awake, maybe this wouldn't have happened. Hey, no, don't think like that. None of this is your fault, okay? I miss mommy, but I'm glad daddy is happier now. What do you mean? He used to argue and cry with mommy. Now everything is quieter and daddy smiles a lot more. He says he'll marry a beautiful cheerleader. Bye, Katie, I'll talk to you later, okay? - Okay. - Okay, bye. That's why he did it. He killed Eleanor because he was replacing her with Amber. It's the same pattern. Replace her with the young cheerleader. But was she involved in the murder? Amber? I don't think so. She's just a messed up kid. I know what it's like to be under his spell. Wait a second. Amber thinks her stepdad killed himself, but what if Garrett actually got rid of him? Mom, I think he arranged everything. But he set me up because he was getting rid of every obstacle between him and Amber. And Zoey must have been too close to discovering the truth. There is still the problem with Eleanor's time of death. I was looking into that. When I got to the house, the heat was on full blast which means the body wasn't cooling down at a normal rate, which could throw the time of death off by a couple of hours, I mean, easy, right? He left the school, makes a quick stop past his house to kill Eleanor, and then he stops at the spa. With Katie asleep upstairs the entire time. So he stabs Eleanor wearing gloves and your raincoat, and then he throws the raincoat into the neighbor's trash knowing that the cops are going to find it. And during Katie's lessons and after Eleanor's death when I was helping him out, he had plenty of chances to steal my phone. He could've easily faked those messages. This is the light at the end of the tunnel, Hannah. I think we have enough to nail him. And if this isn't enough for the cops, we will take it to the press and we will make him famous. Do you smell smoke? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom? Mom! Where are you? Where is she? Hannah, I wish you could understand, I just want a happy family. And now I can start all over again. Katie will never forgive you. No! Katie will never forgive you! Don't you see? I wanted to pin this on Kurtz, but you, you were so easy to manipulate. It was like you were begging me to use you. Every time I had Amber bully you, you just came running into my arms. Oh, I had so much fun killing your mother. Watching you, stalking you. Shame, complete humiliation. Please, no. But you were so fucking curious! Please, no! You know your mother would still be alive, but the two of you couldn't stop asking questions. Please! Please! No! Help! Please, help! Let me out, please! Come on, Hannah. You know how this has to end. No, please. I can... they can help you. Come on, Hannah! Hey! Stand back. I've seen some strong performances in my time, but nothing that fine. They couldn't have given a scholarship to a more deserving artist. Since when did you start saying nice things? Well, your mother has a knack of making the world a lot more bearable. She is the best. Hannah, I've said congratulations, but I don't think I ever said a proper thank you. - For what? - For fighting when the rest of us were scared. I was scared too. Scared, but brave. You certainly saved Amber from a life of misery and, someday, she will thank you for that. I appreciate that. But there's only one thing I really want right now. - What's that? - Mom knows. Mac and cheese? I'll teach you the recipe. I'll learn the recipe.
