What are you going to do at high school? I don't know. Up to Sønden. Why? Most of the students there are students, that's why I said yes. Is that how it is when you're a slave to the big ones? No, that's not how it is. Are you going to sleep in the sleeping room? Yes. Do you think that's something for you? Are you going to go to the university? Only in the spring. That's cool, man. Are you looking forward to it? It's the very first day of high school. There's a lot to look forward to, right? Shut up. What do you know about that? How many boys are there? About 69. Are they out on the country? And the school is by the water? Be careful, you're not drunk. Ole! We're going to eat! Okay, see you. Why the hell are you always after the little ones? Shut up, you're not too good yourself. What the hell are you doing? I have to go somewhere today. I'm going to high school. Why are you going to high school? Are you the one who cancelled the automatic high school? I'm going there because I can't get a good education. Ole, are you coming now? Do you have any money? We're used to you being in the woods. You're not used to it. No. Ole, listen to me. If you can't handle it, you can always come home. You know that. I... I just think it's better up there than at home. I have to take care of my work. And I don't want you to have anything to do until I get home. And you can't be alone at home. Right? We've talked about it, and I understand it. I'll try to handle it. That's good, Ole. It's the next time we're going. Ole, when we get up there, we'll do as agreed. I'll go with you. We don't want to say goodbye to each other in 10 minutes. Okay? Good day. Good day, Mrs. Fransen. Hello, Ole. Welcome. We met each other at the test. I don't know if you remember. Yes. Mrs. Fransen, would you like a cup of coffee? No, thank you. Should I take the bike? Yes, put the bike there. It's a shame. Yes, but I hope we'll see them up here again soon. And they're always welcome. They're welcome to write or call. And we'll get rid of this guy. Goodbye, Ole. Goodbye. Have a good day. Goodbye. Yes, have a nice day. Thank you. Should the two of us go up and find out where you're going? Good morning. Let's get up. Oh, it's midday. No, that doesn't work. Can you come out then? The swimming pool is waiting. Can you then come out and listen? Okay. Look, come out now. I can't lie there all day. Okay. Two spiced coffee beans on the bed. Thank you. Yes, that's good with you. You have 10 seconds. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh, I can't get up. I can't get up. Someone made his math homework. It costs 50 Øres. It doesn't cost more than 25 Øres. But do you have it now? Yes, yes. The boy took the bus to his uncle. On the way, he saw a... What the hell does the cap mean? Shut up, you idiot. Oh, yes. Hey, boy. Aren't you going to ask for a number? Hey, blondie. Do you think I'm a girl? No, have you heard? He thinks you're Marianne. He can't tell the difference between you and her. Come on, for fuck's sake. When can you be the first to come now? I'm coming instead of Ip. Ip? I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. I'm coming instead of Ip. Peter, do you know about the mutt and the seaman? Yes. They like to go to Brøndsbrød. Marianne, isn't there Brøndsbrød? Well, Måns, how's your cough? Oh, well. Ip. Otherwise, we'll just have to eat ourselves if we're good. It's nice with your good mood, Peter. Just make sure you don't come too often. Hey, Rasmus. You know how to go on a diet, don't you? You're a great comrade. This is everyone's reserve. You just have to come to me if you have any problems. Listen up. As you may have noticed, we have a new boy. Ole Fransen. Ole has come instead of Ip Poulsen, who recently left. I'll have to tell you, since you've come a bit later, that we have a number order here at the school. You'll take Ip Poulsen's number, number 67. And then we all have our duties, our daily duties. You should have that, too. Wash-up on Monday and Saturday. And last but not least, 33 and 72. Remember, you have to do your homework in the afternoon. And remember, it's right outside my window, so it's probably wise to order something. There's a package for 75, 13 and 27. It's you, Rasmus. Sorry, 26. There you go. That was big this time, wasn't it, Rasmus? Yes, we need him for math. He's a tough kid. How is he doing? He's doing well. He's got extra pocket money. Extra pocket money? Four kroner a month. That's enough for a small house. Then I'll have to leave. Goodbye. Goodbye. Aha! As far as I remember, dear Rasmus, it's against the school's rules to stay in the classrooms before school breaks. I'm sorry, but I have to deduct your extra work for several weeks. And it's cheap. How many times do I have to tell you, dear Rasmus, that the few rules we have at school are enough to keep so many people together in such a small space. That's right. Come on, Rasmus. Who doesn't want anything? Come on. Yes. At school, we try to get everyone through, and that's why we make certain art-related demands. I have to ask you to go up to the blackboard. Look, here are our calculations, and you can take piece 9 and piece 10. Peter, how do you think Ole will handle this assignment? May I see your EPUB? Well, perhaps the gentleman was too busy yesterday with winning the laurel in noble football to be interested in something as inferior as math. The five minutes are running out. Perhaps you could have sacrificed, or what? Not only do you meet an outsider, but you also steal. That's too bad, Peter. You go to bed at 7.30 p.m., and since I'm the night watchman, you shouldn't sneak in and entertain him. Do you understand? Yes. And let's not often see such behavior. Peter! Måns, don't look so depressed. It looks bad. Very bad. It doesn't apply to all of you. You have to work together to get to the next class. Yes, yes, it doesn't look so bad. You can go to your class. Well, let's see what happens next. Don't you have a cigarette? I have to smoke. I also get a driver's license if I quit smoking until I quit. Yes, I know that well. I also get that, Elsie. But you know what the adults don't see? They don't smoke either. What? Måns. Can't we call him? Måns! Do you understand? He's such a weird guy. He's never home to visit. And then the teacher always has to talk to him. And yesterday, he was so eager to kill himself. Well, he just gets a little grumpy about nothing. And then he's like, well... Well, well. Let's go over to the house. Are you with your siblings? Yes, I am. Well... Dad and Elsie have two little ones. Mom and Sigurd are waiting. That's probably what kids are like. Hi, Mia. Hi. What did your dad do? He was at the office one day. He came home from work. And then... He died. Hey! Do you want to go to an old meeting? Yes. Okay. What do you want? This way. We'll make a picture. What do you think of my hair? It's very funny. Yes, it's very funny. I just want to tell you that you've been stupid for five years. No, I'm sure he'll say something else. No, you shouldn't scare him like that. You can't be too evil. No, I'm not. I'm a good kid. It's disgusting up here. Can't we be in a museum? Shouldn't we go? No. It's very nice, isn't it? Do you know Bessie? Do you know who she is? What time is it? Eighteen. Damn, we forgot the lecture. What's that? We have to take care of our heads and backs. They're also looking for us if we're doing the lectures. But how? Oh, shit! And the seven of them are reading the lecture together. And there's a teacher who's watching us. Who's watching you? Søren. It's to survive. And he's watching us. Hey, kids! See you later. It's almost sunday. What the hell have they done? I can't get it up. Damn it. What are we going to do? You have to get down on the outside. You can do that. It's that one. It's a caterpillar, Ole. Come on. No, I'm not going down. I'm so dizzy. I don't like being up here. What the hell? How are we going to get you down? I don't know. Hey, can you do that? Hell yeah. Are you ready? Ole, come on. It's the first one. Yes, I have to get down. Yes, we'll tie this one up. It's too tight. No. You have to get down that way. What do you mean? It's too tight. Come on, man. Where were you? We were down by the mill. Just sit down. Come back another time. Yes, Peter. Can I go? Yes, you can. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. Can I come with you? Yes, but you haven't got anything on yet. What? It's nice, man. I've got something to eat. I'm lying in bed with these balls. Hi, Peter. Hi. This is for our new boy in the class. Ole. Thank you, Ole. It's a very nice firecracker. Peter, we'll remember you on Saturday. My parents are going on a trip on Saturday. Are you coming? Yes, I'd love to. You can celebrate with Peter. He knows the way. When are we going to eat? I don't know. It's a bit past six. You can't come in the evening. There's a curfew. But tomorrow, right? Yes. Do you want a bun? Yes, thanks. A coconut bun. Ole, see you later. Have a nice evening. Are you coming with her? Yes, you could say that. You're a nice girl. That's good. Aren't we going that way? No, it's closed. It's where the rockers live. The rockers? They're the kind of guys we also have in town. They definitely don't like high school boys. Let's go through here. Okay. Ole, listen to me. You're going after me. And Mom's going to order. You'll be back soon. Rasmus hasn't eaten his dinner yet. That's not possible. Tell me, didn't he get a packet of... What did you say? Yes, potato slices. Grandma and Grandpa didn't put them in the salt for half a day. Are you sure you don't know? Yes, I have a horse. That's why I work here. It's expensive. Are you mad about this meeting? We just arrived late for the lecture. Rasmus cries sometimes. But he always does it when they're new. I think it's really bad for someone. That's what the sixth graders always say. Now they're even the worst in seventh grade. What are you doing? Nothing. Ole is just about to dry up. In the meantime, I'm going to the dining room to dry the tables. I think you should dry the tables, because Ole and I have to go up and look at the uniform. And you, Linda, you're stirring that coffee over there, right? Like this. Morning. You're going to bring Ole up, right? Then you can show him the way down to the dining room. Yes. Don't be nervous. We only use this uniform for home visits. Like this. Can you stand up straight? Like this. Is it hard to fall? Huh? It's hard, right? If there's something in the way, you can always come down to the dining room. Right, Mås? Yes. I think you can take that one off now. Here. You can see a little bit of the bruise on the ear. Don't you think you have a bruise? I think so, too. Oh. It's so pretty. You have to take care of yourself. You have to get some iron for a safe reason, right? You two can go now. You, too. Good morning. Did you get anything good in your package today, Bård? Yes, there are some records in it. My sister and I got some candy and money. That sounds good. Yes. Good night and have a good sleep. Remember to lock the door in half an hour. Yes. What's that? No! Never! What are you doing? No! Give it to me! Give it to me! What are you doing? Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Who was that? Who was that? Who was that? It was you, Peter. No, it was you. The doctor will be here any minute. Let's go and see. Let's go and see when he comes. No, you're really stupid. I don't want to be like that. No, that's enough. Don't you think this is a serious crime? It's a plot and a deliberate vandalism. I'll tell you one thing. I'll talk to Måns. You have ten minutes to clean up. Are you with me? And no money will be given to any of you for the next three weeks. It's the third time in a month, and he's not doing anything. What could he be up to? They're so damn grown-ups. You can't complain about yours. When I think about mine... Well, I've learned to complain, too. What Dad doesn't give me, Mom's Igor should remember. When I think about my mom's third husband... We were in an empty house, watching TV. Just because Støjen took my brother's shit. Don't you think it's just what he said? Well, I think so, too. Who the hell is the big, strong lion that bit my leaf? It's right here. Well, did you get a little scrooge-tour? Yes, you're like a Métis. Are you in? Yes. You know, it's going to be a 25-year-old. If you're into that kind of stuff, you'd better watch out. Or else you'll end up like him in the grave. Shut up. And shut up about your Métis face. Hey, you. Wake up. What's going on? It's like when Peter was alone. It's a little weird with himself. Oh, I'm getting sleepy. Peter, do you think H.H. Slade is home? What could he do? They never report anything home. What would they get out of it? It would be easy to be up here. So just take it easy. What did you make? It's... Oh, it's happening. Yoo-hoo! It's on the trot. The Indians are preparing the cowboy. Up we go. Hope it's going to roar. It's going strong, man. There's a red one in the trot. Run! 13, right? They're right there. I'm not scared of the horse. You're afraid the baby's going to fall? Shut up. It's dangerous what you're doing. Who hired you as a babysitter for the little red ones? I didn't buy any leather jackets, so you don't look like a rocker. You're not afraid of anyone on the trot, are you? You're not going to save any of them. You have to pay for that. Well, let's see if we can run faster. Maybe I can help you on the trot. Can you see I'm coming? You're always up there. Here you go, Rasmus. We're going out tomorrow. The cowboys are coming. It's the old cowboys who share the milk with the men. It's the cowboys who share the milk with the men. Do you know how to make an adventure porridge? You take a week's old cabbage, pepper, tomato and ketchup, plus garlic. Leave it for half an hour. Then it's adventure porridge. It tastes good. I need the answer to the home message from 7.20 a.m. 33, Niels, and 48, Erik. Look down at the office in the afternoon, and we'll call your family. Mom, you can come home with me if you want to. It's just that Åkesson is sick. I usually stay at Åkesson's. I'll tell your mom. Do you have enough room? She doesn't have any room for her friends. She says it's too big. Are you sure about that? Yes, she's all alone. The more people in the house, the better it is. What kind of person is that? I have to tell her if I can't afford the porridge. Will it help? I'll tell her. Are we going out riding again soon? I don't know. Are you that jealous of that horse? I can't afford anything else. Everyone else has lots of smart clothes and all sorts of things. Plates and transistors. It's not your fault, so leave it at that. Where are you going again? To your grandma's? No, I'm going home with Roger. I didn't ask your mom that. But we'll have to wait a little longer. Can you find your way home without waking the others up? I'm so sorry. I'll have to go again. I'll wait for dad and Else to come home with Roger. My mom and Sigurd are never any fun. That's true. How many people will be at the party? I don't know. But their parents are away, so a lot will be there. What the hell is that? Who did that? You don't believe me? Of course not. No, that's not what I meant. Then what did you mean? You can't have a bike like that up here. Why not? Not everyone has a mom who gives money to someone like that. So we're in trouble? Yes. Can it run? I think so. That's good. Then we'll live up there. We're allowed to stay until 11 o'clock. You know where she lives, don't you? That's fine. It's not very warm when they're alone. Baby, baby, dance with me Baby, baby, dance, wonderful memory Baby, dance, make it again Baby, dance, come on Someone needs eye drops. Is it good? Are you in bed? What about the money? You can get something for the whole day. You know how good your dad is. He gets worse and worse, but I don't touch him. Then he's just a kid. Now we're coming in with your new love. Have you heard about it? He's in the same class as Mona and Peter. I think so, too. There's Snaps, by the way. It's a terrible sling shot. It's completely cold. Can we put it in the bag? No, you can't. You're such a wimp. You're a real spider-man. You're a real drag. You're a real wimp. You're a real drag. You're a real drag. Check it out. You're a real drag. You guys did well yesterday. Nice, but I think we should talk to Måns. He's a nice guy. He just doesn't know where he is. We need to talk to him. Lause? Ole? – You're in the car? – No, I'm on the bus. – Let me see your car. – I'm in the car. – You're in the car? – Yes. – Hi, Ole. – What's up? – How are you? – I'm fine. – There's heart in the food. – Yes, vitamin C. I need to get some sleep. – Peter? – Do you like the mushrooms? – Yes, I do. – I'll have a mushroom. – It's cold. – Cheers. – What's that? – I don't know. – It's a canopy. – I don't know what it is. – I don't know what it is. – Peter, get up. Peter. Come down here. Hurry up. – Hurry up. – Peter, get up. – Is Peter sick? – No, he's just sick. – Why are you pushing him to bed? – He's hungry. – What do we do? – We have to get him home. – What time is it? – It's 11 o'clock. We have to get home by 11 o'clock. – Why can't he sleep? – He hasn't moved at all. – What's the matter with you? – We can't go with you – – if you keep doing that. He has to be happy all the time. You're a good boy. They all say that. And those damn adults. You have to let yourself go and be happy for a while. Then everything will be fine. If the others like you, it'll be so easy. You have to smile all the time. You might think it's terrible, but get up. – I can't walk by myself. – Hurry up. – I want to help him. – You have to help him. – You have to get up. – Get up, for God's sake. – What's the matter with you? – We have to get him up here. – We have to get him down. – He's at home. – Get up. – What's the matter with you? – Get up. – You have to stay away from Peter. – I don't want to go home. – He's in the other room. This will never happen again. Go to bed. We'll agree that this is the first and last time you do something like this. Good night. – He always has an answer. – Yes. We don't tell anyone. It's our secret. I don't know what you like best. But you probably don't mind my apple pie. – And Olle Vegard likes it. – Thank you. It tastes great. A pig like that doesn't grow up in a pigsty. – It's so nice. – It's nice to be free from that ring. – Every time you have to change. – What do you mean? – Every time the clock rings, the slaves have to get out. – The slaves? It's nice that no one sniffs the food from your nose, like they do up there. – You don't even eat the big food. – No, just take it easy. Give me a kiss. It's nice to come back to your own home and your own things. Try to listen, so we can sleep in peace. I remember the first time I slept on a sleeping mat. I couldn't fall asleep. You slept on another sleeping mat? My mother couldn't stand me, because she... – Olle, come in here. – What is it? I just wanted to talk to you. Are you okay? It's like you've become someone else. – I'm fine. I really am. – How is it to sleep on a sleeping mat? – Is it comfortable? – I'm used to my own home. But if I can be there, I can just go home. – Many of the other boys can't. – How come? – Their parents don't want them there. – But I really can't. – It's hard to be there most of the time. – I miss you more than I thought I would. – I miss you too, but we agreed... – Can't you write home? – I really don't know where you are. – Where the hell is he? Hi. You're just in time. Sit down. Listen. Go to the lady and tell her a lot of things. Then you go and get her. Then it's your turn to entertain her. Then I'll leave. I'm the last one to leave the relationship. – Anders. Down here. – Peter, what happened? – I just broke up. – That's enough. – Thank you. – How did it happen? I was riding my new bike, when the rocker came after me. – What rocker? – The one with the blue car. – The rocker? – Come with me. – Put it all the way up there. – Where? – Right here. – I have to put it all the way up there. – Remember the bed. – I'm going to take a bath. – Take these two for me. – I don't want them. – Look how many I have. – Take one for yourself. – I'll take care of it. – Okay, come with me. The teachers are over there. I can't jump over the bridge. – You can't jump over the bridge. – It's true. – It's not a lie. It's true. – We're rockers, too. – He says it's true. – We don't want to report it. The parents don't believe in us. – They think we're living a good life. – Don't you think it's good? No, we're always worried. We don't know what's going on. We're worried when we finally get rid of the teachers. Let's see what happens. – Owen, can't you have something? – No, it's a message for a friend. – Hi. – Hi. – I want this. – What's your name? – Ole. – Isn't it nice? – Yeah, with the crosses. – How much is it? – Seven kroner and twenty. – That's great. – Hi, Måns. – This is for you. Måns! Måns! We almost couldn't walk on the street because we're just rockers. Then she got so mad at me that I had to let her go. Look at her face. It's so beautiful. I told her that if she didn't let me give her a spanish kiss, I'd kill her. They think they're all that, but they're grown-ups. – Here, take this. – I want this, too. – I want this, too. – I want this, too. – I'll take this. – No, I want this. Why do you always want the best? I want this. Here I am. Måns, you're really smart. This costs 600 kroner if you get snatched out of school. – Måns, did you take that? – Yeah, so what? You can come to the kids' home and get it. No, I can't. Anna and I are going to put it back. I need all this shit first. – What a pain in the ass. – Don't you get it's shit you've made? – Come on. – Don't make me carry too many bags. – Why are you walking so fast? – Stop it, man. – Come on, let's go. – We'll be right back. Dear Peter, it's nice to hear you're doing well. I've had a good time at Mallorca, and I hope you'll enjoy it. I can't make it to Parents' Day because of work. – Can Lyssen's dad do it? – That's why the package is so nice. He's got a bad conscience. He'd like to, but he can't. You're a fucking smartass. We got to put... Måns, come here. What's wrong? We have to do something now. I've received a message from prison. Your mother will be released in a month, and I've got a job and a place to live. – Can't you send her a letter? – Why? She never writes to me. We've talked about it so often, Måns. She says she's well aware that she's not what she should be. – And now she wants to try again. – She says that so often. She'll be so happy to hear from you. Your brother actually called. – Bjørne? – Yes, he's supposed to be in Helsingør today. He'll visit you tomorrow. But Måns, remember... We can all do something we shouldn't. You and I, too. So maybe you should try not to give in to your mother. – I'm going to get a snuff bottle. – It's nice to have some good friends. – There's nothing special about this. – Dear Måns, we've arrived in New Zealand. I hope you're doing better at school than at Gørningen. – Dear Hilsen Bjørne. – Do you know what I think? – We should... – Måns, we just want to help you. – Take it off! – No, I won't! – Take it off! – Shut up! – Have you seen Måns? – No. – Are you sure you haven't seen him? – He's in the hallway. – Do you think it's the transistor? – How can he be in there? – He's not supposed to sleep. – Måns has never really had a home. His father died when Måns was little, and his mother suffers from kleptomania. – What's that? – She can't stop stealing. It's very serious. Every time she's been able to take care of him... ...he's been sold to private companies and taken to orphanages. That's not very nice. I don't understand why he's gone. His brother came to Denmark today. He was very happy about that. We'll send a few of the big guys to Helsingør to look for him. – Maybe he's gone to see his brother. – Yes. – And then Ole and I will go to the forest. – That's great. – Where's the building? – Okay. Every time I look at the birds in the sky... ...I think of you, my friend. Remember where we were before... – Do you want a coke? – No, thanks. I'm looking for my brother, Anders Sørensen. He's a captain at MSE Gear. – Have you seen him around here? – No, I don't think he's here. – Then you must have forgotten. – I didn't. – He wouldn't have done that. – No. I remember one time I went up to Mads and said, I'm sorry. – I bought a train to the forest. – What happened? I was thinking about my funeral and how they had trusted me. – What happened? – I got up and tied it up. I made a loop from the end. – That was bad. – You can't go to your own funeral. It's like back home on the altar. Dad just died. I wasn't that old. I was thinking about jumping out. Then it could be me and dad. We could be together again. Shouldn't we spread out? Then we'll be better off. No, let's stick together. – Okay. – Come on. – Peter, we have to find him. – Of course. – Do you ever think... – Do you think it's Morgens? Morgens? Isn't that you, Morgens? You must be very sorry for breaking your window. It's not that big of a deal. – You have a great bird. – Really? No one can see it. You have to be with it. Then we can go to bed. If we can sleep on the building, we can go out here. – Is this where you go out? – Where do you know that from? – Because I have to pee. – Come on, man. – I think we're going to eat soon. – I'm starving. But first you have to wash your face. It's a film about Hornbæk. It's going to be exciting. I just got a message. It looks very strong. It reads as follows. Henning Sommer, Morgens. Palle Nielsen, Pim Hansen, Peter Nielsen. Michael Witt, Peter Ammerholm. And the attack... Jan Schmidt, Pim Jansson, Flemming.
