Who will be the sports champion this year? Who else other than, Ravi. No no.. Last year it was Ravi.. ..do you think even this year it will be Ravi? Sure, why not? There he is. Come on, Ravi, come on. Ravi! Chaila Babu. - Will lose. Chaila Babu. - Will lose. Chaila Babu. - Will lose. Poor Chaila Babu. Fell down. Vikram, at least defeat Ravi in this event. Otherwise it would be a great insult for us. Hey, you just watch boys. Come on, Ravi. Come on. Come on. Poor Chaila Babu. The loser is here again. Poor Chaila Babu. He's beaten the dust. lt's a shame. How could you be Chaurangilal's brother? Mahendranath's daughter was making so much fun of you.. But you remained silent like a coward. l'm not a coward. Just wait and see. She'll have to pay for this. Mahendranath. Coming, brother. - Did you send Renu the money she wanted? Yes l did. But whenever she calls she just demands money. But she has never once told me about her studies. She's Kailashnath's niece. There's no need for her to work. Son Hari. Yes, dad? What about the land adjacent to our factory.. ..which l had asked you to buy? A retired teacher owns that land and he refuses to sell it. What? He dares to refuse me? Brother, if you say, l'll handle the matter. Oh no.. why trouble yourself for such a small matter? Son Hari. - Yes, dad. l'll tell you how to vacate that land. Come with me. You've come here again. - l've come here to buy this land. l've told you before, l don't intend to sell this land. But l will buy this land. And here is it's worth. But how can you buy this land.. ..when l don't intend to sell it? We call it business if we consider the seller's approval. lf it's without his approval, it's called oppression. And l've come here to oppress you. And here's the money. There's the lorry to take your belongings. Vacate this place or else.. What will you do? When my father doesn't intend to sell.. ..this land then what right do you have to force him? - This is unfair. - Whatever l like becomes mine. And that's the only thing that matters. And not even the law can go against our wishes. Understand? Do you think that we'll vacate this land if you threaten us? Never! Do you understand? l see. Tell me one thing, lf l touch you once.. ..will you still be as brave as you are now? lnspector, do you know who l am? Whenever a police officer raises his hand on someone.. ..then the victim is no doubt a criminal. l've seen many inspectors like you. They'll be even ready to become my slaves for the sake of money. What will you do then? Shut up! lf you are that rich then instead of vacating the.. ..poor from their land, find another place for yourself. You can buy everything with wealth but not our conscience. l know how to deal with people like you. Come on. This is our new consignment. Come on. Brother, you did send Hari there. But do you think that he can handle this matter? Have you come here to work or nurse the kid? Don't you eat anything when you are hungry? Even this innocent child was very hungry. So l was just giving it milk. Shut up! Mr. Mahendra, what do you think of yourself? - Are these workers your slaves? - Yes, of course. Absolutely. - Mind your language. These are the people who toil hard for you. Chandrashekhar, it was just a mistake, forget it. Why are you so scared? We haven't spent millions on this factory.. ..just to let these lowly workers insult us. How dare you. - No. This isn't happening for the first time. They've been trying to terminate women with children.. ..and pregnant women with children. They just try to find some or the reason to do that. Shekar.. Can we take such a step when you are here? lf he said something wrong, just forgive him. Now you can continue your work. Go. Go. Come, sister. Sir, the police has arrested your son. - What? Who arrested him? - The new circle inspector. We should meet Chaurangilal at this moment itself. Hurry up. - Yes, let's go. Good morning, sir. Shankar, Shambhu. - Yes, sir. ls there any special news on which l can comment on? Yes, sir. Four harijans lost their lives in this struggle? Did the minister visit that place? Not yet. But he certainly will. - Will he go by air or by train? - We don't know that. But things are getting worse there. Okay, so you can record my double statement.. ..you can print it according to the situation. Yes sir. lf the minister goes by helicopter.. ..then write.. On one hand the poor are being oppressed.. ..while on the other hand this man is squandering their.. ..money to visit them What kind of patriot is he? What kind of leader is he? And what if he goes by the train? Then you write.. On one hand, the poor are desperately.. ..trying to save their lives, the minister instead.. ..of using the helicopter to reach there on time.. ..prefers to go by train and reach there 8 hrs late. What kind of a patriot is he? What kind of a leader is he? That means whatever they do.. ..our duty is to malign their image. lt's quite obvious. lt's quite obvious that l won't win the elections. So if l don't give such double statements.. ..the people will almost forget about me. - Mr. Chaurangilal. - l'm here. What brings both of you here? - Come, have breakfast. - Forget it, if you don't.. ..help us now, my son will have to rot in the jail. Okay, but brief me the details in just three words. There was some problem in the dealings.. ..related to the plot next to our factory. And lnspector Jhansi Rani arrested my son. She even took our lorry in custody as evidence. l see. l think this woman is really very courageous. We have not come here to hear her praises. Do something soon and save my son. Please. Kailashnath, l don't want to.. ..get involved in such trivial matters. A man should always maintain his status. Just for once. You'll have to come to the.. ..police station, at least for our sake. Oh no.. the police station maintains a record of all.. ..the criminals of this city. Maybe even you are.. Hey you, shut up. l'll not say anything. Okay, l'll come with you because you are my friend.. ..and for once l don't care about my status. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do one thing. Give my PA a cheque of Rs. 25,000. Rs. 25,000? Oh l see.. you want to bribe someone? Don't ever utter that word again in this house. This goes into my fund for the benefit of the poor. The Social Welfare Fund. Social Welfare.. Now l understand. l'll send the cheque to you tomorrow. There's nothing wrong in it. Shankar, Shambhu. - Yes, sir. l'll not spare you the next time you do this. Get out! No.. That was not meant for us. Let's proceed. Hello. ln fact, she!s been waiting for you. Today!s their bad day. Greetings lnspector. Greeting. - l am.. - Chaurangilal Domukhiya. Kailashnath and he is his younger brother Mahendranath. That means l was right. They have your photographs in the records. Perhaps you didn't know that Hari is my son.. ..when you arrested him. And perhaps you didn't know that it was our lorry.. ..when you took it in custody. Now that you know, you should release him. But why have you come here? Meet me in the court. - Court? Don't try to threaten us. l frequent the court almost every day. Mr. Chaurangilal Domukhiya! No smoking here. - Jhansi! Jhansi Rani. - Okay. You might be the queen, but don't cross your limits and talk. Shut up and get out! lnspector. Don't mess with him thinking that he is just an Ex-MLC. Or else we'll show slides of you being.. ..dishonored in all the theatres. You illegally arrested my nephew and took our lorry.. ..in custody, he'll give this statement to the media.. ..and defame you. lt's not all that easy. l've filed the case along with all the evidences. But for that you need witnesses. And without witnesses the case has no meaning at all. l have not one but five witnesses. - Five witnesses? - Yes - You have 5 witnesses. Yes. We are here to extend a hand of friendship towards you.. ..but you want to handcuff the very same people. ln return of this, you.. Please be patient. Calm down, please. Let's release him on bail. Ok. Sir, what about this garland? Keep it. We'll need it for her funeral. l.. who rules this world.. ..was humiliated by that lowly circle inspector! She wants to punish my son with the help of 5 witnesses. No, she won't be able to do that. Our men will kill those witnesses at any cost. Ranga, start the vehicle. Yes. Madam, an accident occurred near the factory. - Five people lost their lives in that accident. - What? According to the driver, it was a brake failure.. ..and the vehicle dashed into the hut. The driver has been arrested. The inspector is examining the vehicle. - Whose lorry is it? - Mr. Kailashnath's. - There are five witnesses? - Yes. There are five witnesses? - Yes. Good morning, madam. - Good morning. What was the cause of this accident? - Brake failure. Just look at this innocent family who have been victims.. ..to injustice. Just look at these innocent children. They had not even lived their life. l feel as if their souls are demanding an answer from us.. ..to tell them what their fault was. Why were we killed? Now tell me, was it really a brake failure? l am sorry, madam. l don't want my family to have such an experience. l am sorry. Renu, l think Vikram is not well. He's not to be seen. - These men are like that. They trouble us if we fear them. But they run away the moment we raise our voice. Okay bye. - Bye. l'm not one of those cowards whom you were talking about. l won't be able to rest in peace.. ..unless l pay you back for what you did that day. That day you slapped me with you sandal. But today l'll give you such a kiss that.. ..you'll remember it for life. How dare you? Let me go. Take it easy baby. l'll paste these photographs in the very same place.. ..where you had slapped me. Help me! l've seen many people kissing. This is the first time l saw someone kissing shoes. How was it? No. You kicked me? l've kicked many. But today l'll show you a new style. - New style? - Yes, a new style. l'll thrash all of you without setting my foot on the ground. Setting your foot? Without setting your foot on the ground. - Yes, l'll do that. - What if you don't? Then you can take this camera. But what if l do it? - Then.. - Then your own friends will.. ..hit you with Renu's sandals. Right? - Right. Here's your camera. Thank you. l am dead. He's the loser! He's the loser! What's it? Oh God, help me. Nab him! Hey, scoundrel! Where are you running? l accept defeat. Now stop it. Now you still have to be thrashed by your friends. Only then will l come down. Hey you.. come here. Take her sandal. Sandal. - No! - Sandal! Now hit him. - No, l can't. Hey, hit him. Sorry boss! That's enough. Now, l'll come down. lf you take a decision, fulfill it lf you take a vow, abide by it Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love lf you take a decision, fulfill it lf you take a vow, abide by it Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love Since the day we met, l'm not in my senses Unconsciously my thoughts drifts towards you Since the day we met, l'm not in my senses Unconsciously my thoughts drifts towards you Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love lf you take a decision, fulfill it lf you take a vow, abide by it No worship is ever left incomplete Love is no less than worship No worship is ever left incomplete Love is no less than worship Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love lf you take a decision, fulfill it lf you take a vow, abide by it Let me drink the nectar of your love l will sacrifice everything for my love Let me drink the nectar of your love l will sacrifice everything for my love Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love lf you take a decision, fulfill it lf you take a vow, abide by it Nothing should be left incomplete You should be committed to your love You should be committed to your love What a news this is! What happened, my dear? Why are you crying? Are these tears ofjoy or sorrow? - These are tears of onion! - Oh.. so this onion is the cause? How dare he bring tears to a police woman's eyes? - l'll cut it for you. - Oh move away.. don't do that. Okay l won't. You cut it and shed tears. l'll keep staring. - And l'll.. - What are you doing? Mother and father are at home. What's new? They are always at home. What's this? You are stealing daughter-in- law's money. What? l can never do such a thing in my life. What nonsense! Ten years ago your services were terminated.. ..because you were caught red handed. - Have you forgotten that.. - Oh.. shut up! You've grown old, but your tongue wags as ever. This is the way you welcomed me on our first night too. And l think that this will go on upto my grave. Yes. - Father.. - Father.. You brat! You almost killed me. l've been watching since the moment.. ..you sneaked into Mummy's room. What were you watching? What have l done? This is not right. Your mother and your daughter.. ..behaves with me as if l was an intruder in this house. Mother is your wife.. so she is strict with you. And she pesters you because she is your grand daughter. - Sister.. - You've brought vegetables? Yes. We've brought fresh vegetables for you. The brinjal looks so fresh.. just great! lt's been ages since l had a brinjal delicacy. There you go again! Daughter-in-law is here.. she'll lock you up in the cell. ls it the law of this area that you've to buy vegetable for the circle inspector? No Madam, it's all for free. - He!s right. l told the vendor that the Circle lnspector needs vegetables. The very next moment the vendor got to work.. ..and he brought to us all these fresh vegetables. - He had no other choice. - Oh really? That means our department always gets the vegetables for free. Notjust the vegetables, but the whole market. All the groceries. - Free. - Bus tickets.. - Free. - Cinema tickets. - Free. - Shut up. Kanhaiya, you are a government servant.. ..not mine and always remember that. Yes, madam. And listen.. return all these things to the vendors. Don!t take them to your house. - Understand? Pick them up. - Let me help you. l will help you. What are you doing? You will never reform. Come on. Free. Bus number free. - Dear. Oh. Why are you kicking me? My dear. You shouldn't kick your mother. Chameli. What is this? When l went for duty this morning, everything was alright. How come this happened? Forget that and tell me how do l look like this? Like an inflated balloon.. tell me what's this? ls it a child orjust rags? Neither a child nor rags.. just a piece of cloth. l wonder why l married a third hand man like you. No wonder l have no children. l don't want kids. You don't know anything. My first wife Kamli.. s..became pregnant in the first week of our marriage. She was very happy to know that. She was so exhilarated that she suffered a heart attack. And she died. After one month of her death.. ..l met my second wife Vimli. Soon l came to know that she is pregnant too. But even Vimli died. But even she suffered from a heart attack? No.. it was an abortion. We are very unfortunate in this matter. And so l am afraid.. ..that even you'll become pregnant.. ..and l'll lose you too. O shut up! lt's better to die than to remain barren. l am telling you, l want a child immediately. l want a baby. l want to see my junior Kanhaiya.. ..crawling around in my courtyard. Why do you need ajunior, when your senior is here? l crawl for you like a child if you want. Close the doors.. l'll become a child for you. What a shameless man you are! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Then why are you in such a hurry? lf time favours us.. ..we'll soon have a child. But for the time being, l'm starving. Bring something for me to eat. Oh Lord! l'm so unfortunate! He knows nothing other than devouring food. lt's my destiny to be in the kitchen forever. l wish l had married Moomien Lal.. ..l would have had so many kids by now. One would have played a tabla.. ..while the other would have played a Mridanga.. ..while the third would have been playing a Sitar. Oh.. how nice it would have been. Sister? Jyoti, how did you turn into a monkey? - What? You called me 'monkey!? Mummy, did you hear that? You started scaring your uncle right away? l tried to scare him several times.. .. but he doesn!t. - Do you think your uncle is like your grandpa? He hides himself fearing even a rat. Old lady, won!t you rest in peace until you tease me? Yes. - How is that you!ve not lost your hair yet? Yes, son. But l lost my job and financially weak now. Brother-in-law, you were told you come as soon as your exams are over.. ..but you!ve come after your results. Dear, does he feel shy to come home? Ravi, did you pass in your exams? - l passed in 1st class. Well-done. Now we both can have fun playing cards. You are old now. Why would he play cards with you? You will find ajob for yourself. Come in, son. Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing? Good morning, daddy. Good morning, Renu. Hey, where are you going early in the morning? l am.. going to meet my friend. Hey dear, so many days you were out. Now spend some time with your father at home. l'll return early, daddy. Sure. Today your uncle wants to take you to the factory. Okay? - Okay daddy, bye. - Bye. Hi, Ravi! - Hi. A rose should be in the garden. Why are you tanned in this hot sun? Yes, but whom are you searching for in this colortul world? Black color. - Black color? - l'm in search of something. - What do you mean? l mean l've come here in search of ajob. l can get you a betterjob than this. Come with me. lf that's the case, l'm ready to do anything for you. - Tell me what to do? - Come on sit in the car. You said, you'll get me ajob. Why did you get me here? - Where have you brought me? - The office is here. - Where? - Here. - l don't understand. lt's my love and it's for you. - And what about my salary? - A child in a year. And what if l work overtime? Come here.. l'll tell you. - Tell me. - Love. - Love? l'll love you so much.. l'll always treasure your love l'll love you so much.. l'll love you so much.. ..no would have ever loved someone so much You are unique. You are an angel.. l'll always treasure your love l'll love you so much.. ..no would have ever loved someone so much You are unique.. You are an angel.. You are unique.. You are an angel.. O my beautiful maiden Your beauty is alluring. O my beautiful maiden Your beauty is alluring. Even the whole world.. ..is enthralled by your beauty l can sacrifice everything.. ..for the sake of your love No one else is as fortunate as l am.. l'll always treasure your love No one else is as fortunate as l am.. ..for my beloved adores me so much. ls it? No one else is as fortunate as l am.. ..for my beloved adores me so much. The veil goes up and the feeling with me evokes. Your rapturous voice And your alluring eyes l'll love you so much.. ..no would have ever loved someone so much You are unique. You are an angel.. You are unique. You are an angel.. Let go! - l head that you are not ready to do the job? Why have you brought me here? Please don't ruin me. Please let me go. We don't value a woman's tears and honour here. For you are only a source of income for me. Tell me.. will you obey me or not? - No. - No? No! - Get up! - You will not obey me? Get up! What's happening? They forcefully brought me here. l'm being sold. No, she's my daughter and this is our traditional ritual. Shut up. A woman is being sold.. Aren't you ashamed of what's happening? lnspector, you've intertered in our matters before.. And you know what the consequences were. So you better go and concentrate on your work. Shut up. When the jaws of a man eating tiger are removed.. ..and the venom of the snake is removed.. ..then they become weaker than the corpse. lf you even touch this girl.. ..then you would invite trouble for yourself. And if you speak another word, l'll arrest you. Before that l'll tie you in her place. Leave me. - Leave her Mahendranath. - Leave me. Save me. Help me. lnspector, help me. Leave me. Scoundrel! Sir. We got some shocking news to make you happy. - What's it? - There's famine in Jalanpur. There's not even a drop of water to drink. The animals are dying.. people are starving to death. That's such great news. What's the other news? Nallipur Village is facing flood situation. Everything has been ruined. ln one place, people are dying for water. ln other place, there's so much water.. ..that people are drowned to death. But which area will the minister visit first? - ln the famine area or the flooded area. - Don't know. You can record my double statement. You can publish my statements according to the situation. The newspaper is ours after all. Yes sir. lf he visits the famine area first, then write.. ..on one hand the people are drowning.. ..on the other hand the minister instead of helping.. ..them is going to Jalanpur, where there's neither water.. ..nor is the village devastated by flood. Perhaps he's apprehensive. What kind of patriot is he? What kind of leader is he? lf the minister visits the flooded area.. ..then write. The people are thirsting for even a single drop of water. And the minister instead of providing them relief.. ..is going to Nallipur. Perhaps he is thinking about his own survival. What kind of a patriot is he? What kind of a leader is he? - Mr. Chaurangilal.. - What's the matter? ..what brings you here now? What can l do? Jhansi has arrested my younger brother. But what's his crime? He used to run a brothel. There was a raid.. ..and he was arrested in that raid. She even injured uncle. Once again you'll have to forget about your status.. ..and help us. Please. Look. l can save you even if you murder someone. But l won't intertere if its the matter of a woman's honour. Because that would tarnish my image in the society. But if you want l can see to it that his sentence is reduced. Please save him Mr. Chaurangilal. See. l've brought along Rs.25,000, which l owed to you. l've brought that again. Please accept it. No, it is not like that l don't trust you. l trust you completely. Do one thing, send another cheque of Rs.25,000 tomorrow. - For what? - Actually its for.. ..the flood relief fund. - What? But for which flood? - You.. - Okay. You just help us, l'll send the cheque to you. Your honour, l request you to give.. ..shelter to these oppressed women. And Mahendranath his men should be punished.. ..for dishonouring women. Considering the statements of all the.. ..witnesses, Mahendranath has been found to be guilty. And so this court sentences him to six months rigorous.. ..Imprisonment as per lPC Section 294. lnspector, my brother has been sentenced because of you. You can't escape every time you commit a crime.. ..Mr. Kailashnath. One of you have been imprisoned. Now it's your turn. - Jhansi.. - Jhansi Rani. - Whatever it is! lf you cross your limits then.. What will you do if l cross my limits? l'll not spare you. - Chaurangilal Domukhiya.. - Don't mess with him. He's no less than a beast. He'll not spare you. Shut up! Since the day l adorned this uniform.. ..l knew that l'll have to confront people like you. l and my department very know how to handle.. ..scoundrels like you. Understand? Hey listen to me.. Get up.. it's our marriage anniversary today. When he has morning shifts, he sleeps the whole night. And when it's night shift, he sleeps the whole day. l surely must have committed some sin.. ..to get a husband like him. l wonder.. l wonder.. ..where my Mu Ma Lal is. He must have gone to hell. But who is this Mu Ma Lal? l mean to say Murli Manohar Lal. My childhood friend and my distant relative. The government recognised his talent a bit too late. He was honored with the BakaRa title recently. You mean Bakra[Goat] Award? Not Bakra, lts BaKaRa i.e.Basuri Ka Raja [The king of flute] lf he plays his flute here.. ..even the inanimate objects will dance with joy. And if l play the flute, there will be tremors all around. Shut up and go to sleep. l've been doing that since the day l got married. There comes my King of melody. Murlia. - Chameli. Murlia. - Chamelia. Oh no.. l no longer have the right to touch you. But how are you? Just surviving. Oh companion.. Oh no.. please don't sing! Your song will rend the chords of my heart. You were just a musical note, now you are a complete melody. How are your children? Who is it? Who are you? Who is he? ls he your eldest son? l'm your uncle, my son. What's this? You already have grey hair? Did you eat a lot of honey when you were a child? lt's not a bad habit. After all it's sweet. And where's your father, l mean my elder brother? Get lost. Chameli, who is this buffoon? He's not a buffoon. He's that flutist l was talking about. Don't feel offended. - He's my husband. - That's okay, Chameli.. You are his third wife so l thought that he must.. ..be the eldest son of his first wife. Moreover, great artists like me.. ..are always considered to be fools. And why should l be offended even if he abuses me? He is like my own brother. But l don't want to be your brother. - Okay brother! - There you go again! Why are roaming around with so many flutes? lsn't one enough for you? This is where you go wrong, brother. - Again brother! - Forgive me.. forgive me! Just like every note needs a different beat.. ..similarly for every different tune you need different flutes. Wow! Forget that. But tell me, why have you come here? What a stupid question? Why would a great artist like me go somewhere? For a pertormance of course. You can organize a programme too, l'll not charge you. Muralia, let's have lunch. You lay the food, l'll follow you. - You can join us too, brother. - Oh get lost! Are you listening? - Yes, tell me. Come on. l thought that something special is waiting for me. What do you want? - O Lord! Now l have to tell you what l need. Do l really have to give you? Your hands are so cool. And isn't it soft? Oh yes.. softer than the fragile buds. Mummy! Mummy! You came so early from school today. What!s the matter? Have you gone crazy? Look at her.. why is she laughing so much? What's the matter? - She's gone mad. Why are you laughing now? Anything wrong? - Son, you've got.. ..flour all over your face. But l didn't do anything. - Just look at your face. What happened to it? Take a look at your face. Wipe it out. What's this? So many holidays. We have to grant 45 days leave before and after.. ..delivery to pregnant ladies. And what about the salary? - We have to give them. What nonsense? Why should we pay them if they are not working for us? Actually, you've just taken over the responsibilities. So what? Come.. l'll talk to them. What's going on? Do you think this is your house? ldiot? You are nursing your child. She's singing lullabies. You should be thrown out. Sir, please don't insult these women. Even your mother was a woman. lt was a woman who nursed you too. You shut up. How dare you compare me with these children? Sir, are you any different from them? All children are alike. How dare you insult me! Manager! - Yes, sir. Make a list of all the pregnant women working in our factory. l'll terminate their services. - Hari slapped Radha. - What? What? You slapped a woman worker? Why do you create new problems every other day? You don't need to know the problem, dad. This is the matter of my honour. lf you don't kick her out, then l'll leave this house. Mr. Hari, come out! Mr. Hari, come out. Come - Mr. Hari, come out. Mr. Hari, come out. Mr. Hari, come out. What's the matter? Why are you shouting instead of working? Your son slapped a woman today. We want him to apologise to her. And what if Hari doesn't apologise? Don't try to underestimate us, Sir. Everybody has to surrender to the power of money. The money which you are so proud of.. ..it is we who toil for that. And all of us know this fact. So it would be advisable for him to apologise. Why should he? l agree with my son. Those women who can't work properly will be terminated. Here's their dismissal order. Sir, the workers toil hard.. ..for your factory. But you disregard their efforts and throw them out.. ..you think that they won't retaliate. You are mistaken, do you understand? So what will you do? You will strike work, right? Don't think that we'll stoop so low. We've taught many a lesson. Strike is such a weapon that it.. ..is even stronger than an atom bomb. Then let us see your strength. You'll soon come back to us.. ..once hunger gets better of you. You shouldn't underestimate our strength, Mr. Hari. lf you don't withdraw these dismissal orders.. ..and your son doesn't apologise in two days.. ..then we'll be forced to go on an indefinite strike. Better think about it, Sir. Worker's union, long live! Worker's union, long live! Worker's union, long live! Worker's union, long live! This is the time to avenge them. We have to avenge the management who humiliate.. ..us and we have to teach them a lesson. We swear that until they don't take back all our.. ..dismissed workers, none of us will go to work. No, we will not work! He's got a nice voice, he must be having a great personality too. Forget all that.. and do something. His wife Jhansi imprisoned my brother. And now he is all set to bring me to the streets. Now you'll have to intertere in this matter. lt's not advisable for me to intertere in this matter. Please help them, or else they will be ruined. Okay.. but l need to maintain my dignity. lt's not possible for me to intertere in such matters. - Please brother. - Okay. Kailashnath. - Chaurangi. l won't intertere in this matter directly but.. ..l can give you a plan. Tell me. Tomorrow when you are going to your factory.. ..Chandrashekhar will try to stop your car.. ..just let your car run over him mercilessly.. ..and if it becomes a case, then blame on your driver. Okay? - Correct. That's just the right plan. My factory problems will be solved l'll avenge Jhansi too. Thank you very much. lt seems that sister trusts God more than the judiciary. Don't talk like that or else God will punish you. Oh forget it.. what can he do? Whatever it is.. you should have such functions at times. lf we don't.. we won't get sweets. He touched it before we could offer it to God. Get lost, you thief. There are so many guests here, at least.. ..respect me in their presence. But why should l do that? Come on Jyoti. Nobody can stop us now! The one who messes up with us! Will be destroyed. The one who messes up with us! - Will be destroyed. Worker's union, long live! Nobody can stop us now! The one who messes up with us! - Will be destroyed. Down with Kailashnath! We wantjustice! We wantjustice! Down with Kailashnath! Management! - Down! Down! Management! - Down! Down! Move. - Management! - Down! Down! This won't be tolerated. This won't be tolerated. This won't be tolerated. Down with Kailashnath! This won't be tolerated. Down with Kailashnath! Don't stop the car, keep going. Down with Kailashnath! Mr. Ahmed. Mr. Ahmed? Scoundrel! There's a call for you. Someone was run down by a car near the factory.. ..you've been called there immediately. You shouldn't leave the ceremony like this. The ceremony will soon be over. You can go after that. No mother, it's inevitable that l reach there on time. He mercilessly killed our colleague Ahmed. Stop it. l said stop it. What!s going on? lt is Kailashnath who!s responsible for this. He brutally killed Mr. Ahmed. Don't be hasty. We'll conduct an enquiry. What enquiry?! Can't you see him lying dead before you? We have witnessed this brutal act. He did this on purpose. lnspector, he is the criminal. You should arrest him. We are no one to decide that. The court will decide that. Mr. Kailashnath, come out. Come. Stop it there. Please be quiet. lnspector, you!ve come on the right time. Otherwise, they would!ve killed me. l!m not responsible for whatever happened here. l was coming in my car as usual and they started pelting stones at my car all of a sudden. They also threatened to kill me. Shut up. - You shut up. l continued driving. l didn't realise when he came in between. - Arrest him. - He's the killer. Arrest him. Mr. Chandrashekar, l need not listen to your orders. l have to abide by the law. Or rather, you abide by their orders! A poor worker's dead body is lying before you. Under the pretext of Law and order.. ..you are trying to protect these people. Hold your tongue! What do you think law is? ls it so vulnerable to the power of wealth? That it will dance to the tunes of the rich? Yes, law is certainly blind. You turn a deaf ear to the pleas of the poor. lf you don't arrest him today, then we'll punish him. Did you hear that? A lowly worker working in my factory.. ..is threatening to kill me. You should arrest him at this moment itself. Arrest him. - Kailashnath. lf you don't give a compensation of Rs.1 lakh to the family.. ..of the deceased and if you don't surrender yourself.. ..then we'll certainly take our revenge. Stop it! lf you continue to behave like this.. ..we'll have to resort to pressure. Will you punish us instead of these killers? Yes, punish us. We will see. Charge! Kailashnath! Leave him.. l say please leave him. Move! Scoundrel! Leave me. Let me go. No! Leave me. - No! No - Leave me. l said leave me! You? Why have you come here? My brother-in-law who fought against injustice.. ..has been arrested by a merciless inspector. - Brother. - Forgive me, but you have to abide by the law. Relationships mean nothing to you. No matter what the person means to you. Ravi! Your department is here to do justice but.. ..you are nowhere to be seen when injustice is being done. You are just here to protect the criminals.. ..and oppress the innocents. Yes. l have the bail orders. Please release him on bail. Constable? That woman who used to create a hue and cry.. ..even if her husband has a trivial scratch.. ..now the very same woman has arrested him. Where is her concern now? - Give mother. - Let it be. You raised your hands at .. ..your husband. l do not need your help. Father.. tea. Why do you take so much care of me? You can even raise your hands at your husband! Good! You should always be dedicated to your service. Your contribution will be commended. You will gain fame. You will become very famous. Jyoti, come have your dinner. Had your father been wounded.. ..would you feel hungry? Dear. Dear. Jhansi, what's the matter? Why are you crying? Everyone at home hates me now. Everyone is cursing me. l don't know whether what l did today.. ..was right or wrong. But l just know that l was bound by my duty as a police officer.. ..and was forced to take that step in that situation. But l'm ready for any punishment.. ..for having wounded my husband. Please don't say that. Your duty is the most important. Lord Brahma is the creator of this world. Whereas Lord Shiva destroys everything. But both of them are worshipped. We revere both of them. And that's because they are true to their duties. l fulfilled my duty as a union leader. And you fulfilled the duty of being a police officer. Both of us have fulfilled our duties. We gave utmost importance to our duties. And you are crying for such a small thing. Do you really mean it? Of course, l do Long live, Comrade Chandrashekhar. Long live, Comrade Chandrashekhar. Long live, Comrade Chandrashekhar. Don't shout! He is lying on the bed inside. Won't you even let his take rest? Madam, Chandrashekhar will go on a hunger strike from today. - What? - Yes. As long as the management doesn't.. ..fulfill our demands, he will continue his hunger strike. And he will continue it until his last breath. Are you going on a hunger strike from today? Yes.. why? - Don't you want me to? - Why would l stop you? l am proud that the man who is fighting for the poor.. ..and against injustice is my husband. l will pray for your success. l am your wife. Daddy, if their demands are not fulfilled.. ..then will you lay down your life? Don't cry, my child. No. Get up all of you. Go and have your bath. l'll take care of brother-in-law. Good morning, brother-in-law. Mr. Shekhar. Mr. Kailashnath wants to meet you once. Why? He wants to discuss something about this strike. l'll call all the workers here. Ask him to come here and talk to us. Don't be obstinate, brother-in-law. Maybe he's ready for a compromise. Listen to me and go. Maybe we have some good news for our colleagues. Let's go. Let's go, sir. Come Shekhar. Have a seat. Are you ready to accept our demands? Absolutely. l'll withdraw all the dismissal orders which were issued. We are ready to give Ahmed's family a compensation of Rs.1 Lakhs. And what about our salaries? l'll give that too. We won't take any action against anybody. Notjust that, we are ready to accept all your demands. What are you thinking? Please sign it, Sir. Okay, l'll sign it first. What difference would it make? - Are you happy now? - Worker's union - long live. That means all our differences have been solved now. Why don't you order juice for him now? Yes. Son Hari. Shekhar, drink it. All this has happened just because of your son. Ask him not to intertere in our matters henceforth. Good luck, Shekhar. Greetings. You've won, brother. What's the matter? l can't bear the pain. Maybe it's because you had thatjuice on an empty stomach. Wait here, l'll bring the cycle. Shekhar, you are finished. We had poisoned the juice. You will breathe your last before you reach the gate. And all our problems will be solved forever. You devil! You should be ashamed of yourself. l'm proud that l sacrificed my life for my goal. And l have achieved that goal l just have to hand over these papers to the workers. And even if l die after that.. ..l wouldn't be sorry. Snatch that paper from him. l'm not a saint.. l!m the dearest brother of Brutus. Just give those papers to me. What? Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Daddy! Mummy! Daddy! Kailashnath wanted to discuss something about the strike. Then we went inside. But we couldn't reach a settlement. He just stormed out of the office in anger. l told him that he is very weak and he should take my support. But he didn't listen to me and he was.. ..run over by the lorry. And he died on the spot. Send the body for a post mortem. Yes madam. No my child, he has undergone a lot while he was alive.. ..don't allow them to tear his body to pieces. l won't be able to bear it. l'll die. Dear, just cremate his body. The law doesn't allow this. At least give us the permission to take out a procession. Ok. Brothers, adorn him with the red flag. He has sacrificed his life for the workers. Salute this martyr. Comrade Chandrashekhar! - ls a martyr. Comrade Chandrashekhar! - ls a martyr. Glory to revolution! When the satans came together.. ..to commit this brutal act Justice was lost to anonymity The corrupt were commended Where was the law? Where was justice? When the truth is mercilessly.. ..massacred .. When the benevolent meets death at the hands of evil Where was the law? Where was justice? Demands an answer.. ..the voice ofjustice Some evil people.. ..revel in their victory They join hands with enemies.. ..just to betray their friends The one who decided the destiny of others.. ..look, what he had to go through For all his efforts and dedication.. ..he was awarded the bed of death Demands an answer.. ..the voice ofjustice Where was the law? Where was justice? Her eyes are parched like the deserts.. ..for its devoid of tears Destiny has left her all alone But she's still so young She's like the undaunted mountains Why would she shed tears Whether its death or accolades.. ..for her duty is supreme When there are no tears in eyes.. The heart cries within.. Where was the law? Where was justice? Demands an answer.. ..the voice ofjustice ..the voice ofjustice ..the voice ofjustice Don't cry like that. Destiny has been unfair to me, Ravi. What a life this is! My husband's body was lying before me. But l didn't have the freedom to cry. Have courage, sister. He may have left us.. ..but his principles will always be with us. The principles for which he sacrificed his life.. ..will always remain with you. His principles will always be alive. His ideals will give you the strength. He will always be with you. His emotions will always be with you. And this will lead you to your goal. And help you to vanquish the evil. What do I do, I found an oId man. Are you giving bath to your husband or a donkey? Scrub properIy. - I!m doing it. What do you think about Bankara? - What do I think? That Ioafer is crazy about his programme.. ..and you are crazy about his fIute. Shut up! Bankara is a great musician. He is not great. He is a wicked man. If I was a queen, I wouId have rewarded him with goId coins. I wouId give him the titIe of a great singer. If I was the king, I wouId have sent him to the gaIIows. I am noticing that since you are appIying soap to me.. ..you are onIy praising him. He has just barged into my house. Just Iike an unweIcome guest! Sit down! AppIy the soap properIy. Oh, the fIute notes! MusicaI notes. ChameIi, when did you come? The moment you started pIaying. Bankara, which note is this? - Anuraga. What is the Iock of Anuraga? - Godrej. That was wonderfuI. - Yes. Bankara, pIay it again. - I!II pIay right away, ChameIi. ChameIi? ChameIi? Look, how is he yeIIing? I hope he does not misunderstand me. PIease go. Go inside, ChameIia. Goodbye. Goodbye. To heII with you crazy for music! Left your job incompIete and came here?! You won't understand how meIodious his fIute is. When he pIays the fIute, I wish I was a fIute. Become a bamboo, at Ieast it is of some use. What's so speciaI about his fIute?! I can pIay it better than him. Brother, even you know to pIay the fIute? Give me the fIute, and then watch the magic of my fIute. Ok. Excuse me, this is a fIute not a stick. I know it is a fIute. Stop it, you can't even bIow a whistIe properIy.. ..and you'II pIay the fIute. Shut up! If you try to Iaugh again.. ..I wiII thrash you with this. Thank you.. Ravi? WiII the enmity of our eIders become a hurdIe for us? No Renu. Whenever I Iook at my widowed sister.. ..hatred for your father and uncIe increases. I feeI Iike going and.. But I don't have any bitter feeIings against you. Renu! We are going to get married very soon. With every other Ioafer, if you.. You are a Ioafer You shameIess! She humiIiated you in the pubIic. Even then you haven't stopped foIIowing her? Shut up. That was another city. Then I was an ordinary student studying with you. But in this city I am ChaurangiIaI Domukhiya's brother. What wouId you do even if you were someone eIse's brother? I chaIIenge you that I wiII marry this girI within 24 hours. What?! Your brother is in Iove with my niece? He Ioves her as much as a poIitician Ioves his chair. - Come dear. - What's the matter, uncIe? - Nothing. He is Mr. ChaurangiIaI Domukhiya and his brother VikramIaI. - Do you know them? - I don't know him. But I know him very weII. A student named Ravi had thrashed him a Iot in coIIege. I saw him then. And the other day he was about to be thrashed, .. ..I saw him then too. That's aII. Forget it. They are very cIose to us. This boy Ioves you a Iot. If you consent, he is wiIIing to marry you. Sorry, uncIe. I shouIdn't be saying this. But it is better to say it that I Iove someone eIse. Sorry, Mr. ChauringiIaI. Bye. WonderfuI! Who says that India is Iagging behind? It has progressing in this matter. It is good. You teII me what shouId I do? Force her to get married. What eIse? What are you saying? She is my reaI brother's daughter.. ..who is in jaiI right now. How can I get her married in this situation? Sorry. I am not asking you to commit a murder, but to get her married. If you can't do it, Ieave it to me. By pubIishing one statement in the newspaper.. ..and I can force them to get married. Even a crueI man wants to get his daughter married.. ..to a decent boy.. ..ChaurangiIaI. Do you mean I'm worthIess? - That's what my niece toId me. You may Ieave. KaiIashnath.. It is dangerous to mess up with me. - You know what I am. - Yes, I know. You are the ex - MLC. And I am a miIIionaire. Ok! Shankar, is the car ready? Yes, sir. - Shambhu! - Is the driver ready? - Yes. - Leave this house right now. Damn it! If I am not married to Renu, we wiII Iose our status. To chaIIenge a dangerous goon or to provoke a poIitician.. ..Ieads to the same consequences; destruction. Look, how I ruined KaiIashnath's house. HeIIo. - Greetings, inspector. Who are you? One who respects Iaw. Your husband Chandrashekhar was run down by a truck. In fact he was murdered. How do you know? How come an ordinary factory worker Sanyasi Raja.. ..suddenIy becomes the owner of a Iiquor shop? Investigate, you wiII come to know the truth. But sir, you had pIanned this murder. Now you toId this secret to the inspector. - What is this? - This is a trap. UntiI KaiIashnath!s famiIy is surrounded by troubIes.. ..he wiII be in my controI. He's so wicked that he'II first attack me if he gets a chance. I see! So this doubIe crossing is caIIed poIitics. Do you know the meaning of poIitics? This is an eviI word. PoIitics has four aspects. Po.. Ii.. tics. Synonymous to corruption, maIice, wickedness, fraud. I am a master in aII these things. Oh God! It is better to go begging.. ..rather than become a P.A. of such a poIitician. Remember, this secret is onIy between us. If it is reveaIed, your entire famiIy wiII be finished. Here, you are. SpeciaI drink from Sanyasi Raja. Have it at one go. You won a Iottery. Good. And it is very good that you have opened a wine shop. But the name of the shop 'Sanyasi Raja Wine Shop'.. ..is not good. Oh Sanyasi Raja! Hey Kanhiyya. - WiII you have a peg? - I onIy do my duty. CircIe Inspector has summoned you to the poIice station. Oh, my sister has summoned. She must have caIIed to congratuIated me.. ..for my new wine shop. Come. We are going. Don't teII my daughter-in-Iaw that I am sitting here. AIright, I wiII teII her that you have said that.. ..you are not sitting here. Good. - Come on. - Look after the shop. Kanhaiya.. ..where is my sister? - In there. She is waiting for you. Madam. Sorry, sis. I forgot to invite you for my inauguration.. ..of my wine shop. Aren't you surprised that how did I become rich over night? I had bought a Iottery ticket to try my Iuck. I won Rs. 1 Iac. That's it. I'm gIad. I want to have few words with you. Come. What does she want to taIk to me about? No, that can't be. Come, sit down. You are giving me so much respect, that I am overjoyed. Why are they tying me up, sister? - You aII may go out. - What is aII this? Sister! - How did he die? - He was run down by a Iorry. Sister! - Sister?! No brother is so happy on the death of his sister's husband. OnIy wicked and seIfish peopIe Iike you are happy. Come on, teII me the truth. You are the onIy witness of his death. - How did he die? - He was run down by a Iorry. TeII the truth. From where did you get so much money aII of sudden? I won a Iottery. TeII me. He was kiIIed, right? The doctor certified that he died in an accident. Why are you punishing me instead of him? Doctor! Why did you go away? How wiII I Iive my Iife now? TeII me, how wiII I Iive now? - How did he die? - He consumed sIeeping piIIs. And he Ieft this note. An innocent person Iost his Iife because of my mistake. I began to hate myseIf. My conscience tormented me. WeIcome! I knew you wouId come. It is a custom that if a woman comes to a house.. ..for the first time, the man asks his wife.. ..to give her a traditionaI weIcome. But unfortunateIy you are on duty right now. And I had forgotten that you are a widow. You made me a widow. I wiII send you behind bars. - Under what charges? - For kiIIing my husband. Is it? Any proof? Dr. Narendra's dead body. You were afraid that he might reveaI the truth. You kiIIed him, and said it was a suicide. You have no idea that faIse witnesses can change the verdict. On one hand wiII be my witnesses and on the other hand the corpse. How wiII that corpse heIp you? Corpses don't speak. Sanyasi Raja's statement is enough to get you punished.. He won't give a statement because he is dependent on me. I wiII put you in jaiI to protect him from you. ConstabIe. - Wait! I not onIy commit murders, but I am aIso very smart. I knew you wouId come here with this intention. I have aIready made a way to my escape. Anticipatory baiI. Before getting arrested, reIeased from jaiI. If you think you can escape with the heIp of it.. ..then it is your fooIishness. I very weII know how to deaI with criminaIs Iike you. I am safe Iike a king in my fortress of weaIth. Neither can you break it, nor do you have the power enter it. I agree that I poisoned your husband and kiIIed him. Can you arrest me? I aIso confess that I paid Sanyasi Raja.. ..to make him give a faIse statement. Can you arrest me? And I aIso admit that I kiIIed the doctor fearing.. ..that he might give you the reaI post mortem report. Can you arrest me? So don't try to act too smart. Get out of here before you Iose your Iife. Or eIse your daughter wiII aIso be separated from you. Not to her husband's house. But to an infamous pIace. Out! Get out! You protected the distressed. That is why You are caIIed God. And here we save peopIe from injustice.. ..so we are caIIed the poIice. It is untrue that you exist. It is true that our existence has no meaning. You are not abIe to do anything in spite of knowing the cuIprit. Then why are you worshiped? If we are heIpIess in spite of knowing the cuIprit.. ..what is the use of this uniform? Sister, the one who has come is your brother, not God. Perhaps Iaw does not support you. But I, your reaI brother, wiII support you. You need proofs to send the criminaI behind bars. But I onIy need to know his identity to thrash him. If you want my brother-in-Iaw's souI to rest in peace.. And the Iaw with you trust, through it.. ..if you want to send KaiIashnath in jaiI.. ..then there's onIy one way. Join hands with me. We are reaI brother and sister. If we fight for justice together, the victory wiII be ours. The victory of justice and truth. Join hands, sister. Manager. - Yes, sir. TeII the new workers to come to work from tomorrow. By appointing new workers, the workers on strike.. ..might create a commotion. If they do anything Iike that, I'II teach them a Iesson. Good evening, uncIe. - Good evening, dear. - What's the matter? - I have a cIassmate.. ..give him a job in our factory. How can I refuse to you? When you refused marriage, I accepted enmity.. ..with a affIuent man Iike ChaurangiIaI. So on your recommendation; can't I give someone a smaII job? I sureIy wiII. Give me his name and quaIification. Manager. - Yes, sir. But give him a permanent job, not temporary. He wiII get a permanent job. Manager? - Yes, sir? Draft an appointment Ietter, I'II sign it. - Okay, sir. Happy now? - Yes. Thank you, uncIe. Ravi! Ravi.. ..your job in our factory is confirmed. Join the duty tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you very much. I got you a job with so much difficuIty.. ..and you are just saying thanks? Then what eIse do you want? Love in the rain. We are burning in the fire of passion We are burning in the fire of passion Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. CIimate is coIorfuI This atmosphere is intoxicating CIimate is coIorfuI This atmosphere is intoxicating There are showers of rain We yearn to meet Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. We are burning in the fire of passion We are burning in the fire of passion Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Lightning struck And showered on the mountains Lightning struck And showered on the mountains Two Iovers are Iost in each other Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. We are burning in the fire of passion We are burning in the fire of passion Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Love in the rain.. Dance in the rain.. Good morning, sir. - Good Morning! Excuse me, sir. My son is dead. And I have no money to perform his Iast rites. I am not a beggar. I am a retired government empIoyee. I need your heIp. Can you give me Rs.50? Rs.50? Rs.20 wiII do. At Ieast Rs.5. I am not a beggar. I am government empIoyee. Thank you. Sir, sir. - He gave you. - Pauper! What a strange man! Other men sIeep in the office. And stay awake at home. And I wonder what is wrong with my husband. He goes to bed soon after he comes home. He eats and goes to sIeep. Where are you going? - He beckons me. - Who beckons you? The meIodious tune of the fIute excites me. That wicked feIIow! You can't go. - I wiII go. - You can't go. - I wiII sureIy go. It is better to spend my Iife with a musician.. ..rather than a man Iike you. You are unaware of my power. If you don't stop this nonsense, I wiII kiII him. Lie down quietIy. - Let me go to Bankaram. - You are not going anywhere. OnIy me and you. OnIy me and you. Good morning, sir. My son is dead. I have no money to perform his Iast rites. PIease heIp me. I am not a beggar. I am a retired government empIoyee. - I am heIpIess. - So what can I do? Give me Rs. 20. Rs. 10 wiII do. - I am sorry! Okay, Rs. 5 wiII do. - OnIy Rs. 2. - Grandpa! Mother, today near my schooI, Grandpa.. Disgusting! With the death of my son.. ..the image of this famiIy has been tarnished. Such a shamefuI behaviour of a young girI?! Whom are you taIking about? I wouIdn't worry if it was someone eIse. Your dearest grand daughter was romancing with a boy in pubIic. - Why are you Iying, grandpa? - Lies! Then what is the truth? Weren't you fIirting with that grey-eyed boy on the bus stop? Grandpa, aren't you ashamed to Iie at this age? Jyoti! This is how you behave with your eIders? III-mannered girI! Move aside, mother. I'II teach her a Iesson. Don!t hit me. I did not do anything wrong. Near my schooI, grandpa was begging to peopIe and saying.. My son is dead. Give me money to perform his Iast rites. And with the fear that I might teII this to you.. ..he made this faIse accusation on me to save himseIf. I am teIIing the truth. I am innocent. I did not do anything. Jyoti. Mummy! CaIm down, dear. Father-in-Iaw, if you consider it as your insuIt.. ..to ask for pocket money from your daughter-in-Iaw. Then why don't you understand that begging on the streets.. ..in the name of your son is a disgrace to the entire famiIy. Dear.. you beg? Disgusting! I am not crying because my son is no more. I am crying because you are yet aIive. Mr. Mahindra, you have come here?! I went to CentraI JaiI with a procession to weIcome you. You came here? Never mind. GarIand, pIease. WeIcome! What's the matter, ChaurangiIaI? The same oId thing. The other day I had proposed to Mahendranath's daughter.. ..for my son, you had refused. Today I have come to say the same to Mahendranath. I see. So this is his intention behind coming here. EIder brother's opinion is my opinion. ChaurangiIaI, I have aIready toId you to forget about it. I had tried my best, but it is difficuIt to forget it. Why? Because when two decent men separate, .. ..they can Iive peacefuIIy. But when two eviI men separate.. ..they keep digging graves for each other aII their Iives. I easiIy escaped from the pit you had dug for me. I very weII know that you were the one.. ..who provoked Jhansi Rani by teIIing her about the murder. No, My Lord! I had shut my mouth since that day. I don't know anything. I didn't even open my mouth since that day. - KaiIashnath. - Yes? I was responsibIe for murders and riots. And when I was bored of it, I came into poIitics. I am very smart. Don't try to provoke me. Even if I provoke you, you cannot harm me in anyway. Is it? - Yes. Do you know where is the document which.. ..has your and Chandrashekhar's signatures? Sanyasi Raja has destroyed those documents Iong ago. No, dear. He soId them to me for Rs.50,000. Don't be surprised. I know everything about you. What wiII you do with those documents? You know that Sanyasi Raja is in jaiI. We wiII give these documents to Jhansi Rani. You know that too. Those documents are enough to send you to the gaIIows. - You know that too. - What do you say? I beg of you, Mr. ChaurangiIaI. No. I onIy want your niece for my brother. Sure. My niece wiII marry your brother onIy. - What say, brother? - As you wish. - That's better. - Then Iet's ceIebrate it with a drink. For beer, I am aIways ready my dear. Cheers. - Cheers! Stay there. Don't worry. This marriage can never take pIace untiI I am there. I wiII deceive your dad and uncIe in such a way.. ..that the marriage wiII take pIace but the groom wiII be this Ravi and not Vikram. Okay? - Okay. HeIIo, sir. - You? What!s the matter? Sir, more than fifty percent of the Iaborers don!t come to the factory.. ..which is affecting the production. So, do you expect me to shut down the factory? No, sir. If you cooperate with me.. I can give you the idea to bring back the Iaborers without any condition. Without any condition? - Yes, sir. - How? You have to promise one thing. - TeII me what the matter is. Sir, I Iove a MusIim girI. Her parents don't approve of this marriage. If you couId get us married.. - Is the girI mature? - Yes, sir. - Then there's no probIem. I wiII get you married in my presence. No one can stop us. - But .. - I'II bring the workers right now. Proceed. I have brought aII of them. - Okay. I won't forgive any mistake again. - And those who were dismissed wiII not be taken back. - Okay. - And Ahmed's famiIy wiII not get compensation. - No need. - And you won't be paid for the days of the strike. - Okay, sir. You resume your duty. Is this a dream or magic? What did you teII them? I can't teII you that. It is a trade secret. Keep your promise. Get me married. Then I'II teII you everything. Your marriage wiII take pIace tomorrow itseIf. Thank you, sir. There's nothing to fear. Carry on. My goons have surrounded the pIace. The poIice are down there. - Listen. - Yes. - The girI's father might try to come up. TeII the poIice not to aIIow him untiI I give orders. - Okay, sir. - Then there's no probIem. Carry on. Stop! You cannot go upstairs. My daughter is getting married. Let me go. Lies! There's an inter-caste marriage going on upstairs. How can she be your daughter? Someone is frauduIentIy marrying my daughter. No. Your brother himseIf has ordered.. ..not to Iet anyone upstairs. Look. Oh my God. TeII her to take off the veiI. The bride's face can't be seen. No way. Their reIigion does not permit them.. ..to show their face to a stranger. We cannot insuIt a reIigion. Take the photo Iike that. Ravi, tie the wedding string quickIy. Oh my God! My responsibiIity is over. PoIice, Iet the bride's father come up. I have no objection. You may go. I bIess the new coupIe and gift them Rs. 5000. - Brother, we are ruined. - What happened? You got them married. But do you know who the bride is? - No. - Our Renu. Thank you, uncIe. I am gIad that you got us married. After aII who are you? My brother. And now your son-in-Iaw. Do you think this marriage wouId be accepted? It wasn't a deception. You and the pubIic was present. You got us married according to both the reIigions. - And you aIso gifted a wedding string. - I'II snatch it away. Mahendranath, you have served a sentence of 6 months. If you try to separate this coupIe.. ..I don't need to teII you what punishment you wiII get. Let's go, Renu. We take your Ieave, father-in-Iaw. See you, father-in-Iaw. Where is that worthIess Bankara? Won't he come to have food? You had warned him not to open his mouth without permission. I had toId him not to pIay the fIute. I didn't teII him not to eat. Where are you, Bankara? Did you caII for me, brother? Don't you know anything other than giving shocks? Come on, eat. The steeI pIate is shining. Madam is serving hot porridge. And I am doomed. Why are you insuIting this Ianguage? When I was in America, I wrote a dictionary.. ..on a combination of Sanskrit and EngIish. Didn't you write a teIephone directory? What happened? - Is she vomiting? - Yes, she is. - Is it what I am thinking? - Yes, it is. The tune for IuIIaby. I am ruined! Oh God! I am deceived. I am sure that I've been deceived. Radha!

Even if the inspector stopped you, why did you stop? That's okay,. But now who wiII persuade ChaurangiIaI? I hope he does not attack us. Dad, Ravi is sitting in your chair. My chair?! - Yes. He is trying to mess with me? Let's see. How dare you sit on my chair? Get up! Why are you Iosing your temper, father-in-Iaw? Don't taIk nonsense. TiII yesterday.. ..you were just an ordinary worker. - And today you are sitting in my chair? - So what? I am your son-in-Iaw. I hoId a right on haIf the property. - Right, darIing? - Did you caII for me, darIing? Hey girI, have you gone crazy? Your father and uncIe are standing here. Don't you feeI ashamed to caII him darIing? I am heIpIess. According to Hindu reIigion.. ..husband is considered as God. Like God. - God? He is Iike a dog. Get up from the chair. Not possibIe, smaII father-in-Iaw. Because as per Iaw, I hoId the right of 50°/ₒ of property. - I won't give you a penny. - I won't take a penny either. I have taken 50 °/ₒ of my share. Before going to jaiI, you had transfered aII the property.. ..in your daughter's name. These are the documents. Registered documents. And I have given aII my shares to Ravi. Here are the registered documents. FooIish girI, what have you done? My brother's useIess daughter, you have ruined us compIeteIy.. ..you have put us to shame. - Respected father-in-Iaw. - What? You are not yet compIeteIy ruined. OnIy the roof has coIIapsed, the castIe is yet to coIIapse. Just come out and see how compIeteIy ruined you are. ShaII we Ieave, darIing? - Yes, dear. Don't Ieave the bag. - Oh no. Friends, being your comrade Chandrashekhar's .. ..brother-in-Iaw, when I stepped in this factory .. ..for the first time, you Iooked at me with hatred. These cheap peopIe shouId have been out of the gate. - Why did you bring them in? - Mind your Ianguage! Or you wiII have to go out of the gate. You trusted me and came inside. So the workers who were dismissed, .. ..I withdraw their dismissaI orders. Thanks! I cannot bring your husband back. But as a compensation for it and for workers' weIfare.. ..in the memory of my brother-in-Iaw.. ..I give you Rs. 1 Iakh. BIess you, son. Long Iive Mr. Ravi! Stop it! Do you think you wiII keep spending our money generousIy.. ..and we wiII keep waiting? We wiII dismiss them again. And we wiII send you where we have sent your brother-in-Iaw. KaiIashnath! I wiII ruin your castIe of weaIth buiIt on the foundation.. ..of injustice and corruption. I wiII destroy the injustice.. ..for which my brother-in-Iaw sacrificed his Iife. I have taken an oath to avenge for my sister. I've come here to ruin you. TiII I get you handcuffed, even death can't come cIose to me. Remember this. - Is there no way to teach him a Iesson? - There is. ChaurangiIaI Domukhiya. Why have you come here now? You have got your daughter married to someone eIse. We were prepared to get Renu married to your brother. But that wicked feIIow cheated us and took away our daughter.. ..and your wouId be daughter-in-Iaw. He has insuIted us, but he has put you to shame. I mean to say, avenge for it. Whenever someone chaIIenges me, he Ioses his Iife. I wiII get him kiIIed. My daughter wiII become a widow. According to Hindu reIigion, a woman becomes a widow.. ..after 11 days of the husband's death. After kiIIing him, we wiII get her married to my brother. Your daughter wiII be a married woman again. What say, dear? - Brother, I accept it. If wicked men Iike us unite, it is not difficuIt to kiII.. ..one honest man Iike him. Get ready for the attack. HeIp! Hey, today you are finished. Inspector, they attempted to kiII me. I want to Iodge a compIaint against them. - Take them away. - Come on. Yes. - Jhansi. - Jhansi Rani. Okay. ProbabIy you are the queen, but I!m the king of Andhenagari. Shut up. After getting power, one shouId not forget his manners. I am toId that you have arrested KaiIashnath's son and my brother. If you don't reIease them immediateIy.. What wiII you do? There wiII be bIoodshed. Do you think that you wiII kiII peopIe and Iaw wiII sit idIe? Listen, Inspector. I wasn't taught good vaIues when I was a chiId. Instead I was taught new methods to commit crime. Don't taIk nonsense! If you are adept at defying Iaw.. ..then even I am an expert in punishing criminaIs. You just try doing that, and watch what I do to you. Ladies and GentIemen, your ChaurangiIaI Domukhiya.. ..who usuaIIy issues doubIe statement to the pubIic.. ..is standing amongst you in this meeting. Why? Just think that in democracy the Iaws wiII are amended.. ..for the sake of the pubIic. Today the poIice is misusing that Iaw to harass the pubIic. The poIice heIp their reIatives. The poIice ignore their mistakes. Is this democracy or tyranny? How can they be the protectors of Iaw? What kind of Ieaders are they? AppIauds! I teII these poIicemen that I can sacrifice my Iife.. ..for the pubIic. I warn the poIice who is coming to terrify the poor pubIic.. ..that I am not going to move from here. Nothing can move me from here. Stop this meeting. Nobody can stop me from speaking today. You are not given the permission to hoId a meeting here. Why wouId you give the permission? You have put my son and his brother in jaiI iIIegaIIy. Now you have come to snatch away our citizen rights? - Stop taIking nonsense! - Look at this woman. Stop this meeting immediateIy. I request you aII to vacate this pIace immediateIy. Because the antisociaI eIements have heId it to spread disorder. PIease Ieave immediateIy. PIease don't go. Sit down. Mr. ChaurangiIaI, I give you Iast warning. Leave the mike and come down. I wiII never Ieave this mike. Like Karan was born with an shieId.. ..I was born with a mike from my mother's stomach. This mike wiII go with my corpse. I wiII never Ieave it. Mr. Mohan. Arrest him. You wiII never Ieave the mike? Long Iive Democracy! Long Iive Democracy! Down with poIice atrocities! It is better to die rather than.. ..surrendering to the poIice atrocities. I am burning myseIf aIive to teach them a Iesson. Brother, get the petroI. Move. - What are you doing? Take him away. - Down with poIice atrocities! Did our ancestors sacrifice their Iives for the freedom.. ..of this country, so that we are deprived of our freedom. These poIicemen are humiIiating justice. What are you watching? Attack. RevoIution! Stop it! Fire! Look at this paper. Four innocent peopIe died in the poIice firing. IndustriaIist KaiIashnath arrested. And protest everywhere. What!s going on? We have guns, that does not mean we shouId kiII peopIe. That wouId be tyranny, not democracy. The situation had become worst. The goons began to abduct young girIs. They tried to moIest them. They began to kiII poIicemen. If I had waited for the orders of my superiors.. ..the situation wouId have been out of controI. That's why except firing orders, I had.. No, Mrs. Jhansi Rani. You took advantage of the situation.. ..and trying to kiII ChaurangiIaI &amp; his associates.. ..because of your personaI differences. Sir - Not onIy that, without the permission of your seniors.. ..why have you kept Sanyasi Raja in the Iock up? Because he is an important witness. Of which case? In the murder case of Chandrashekhar.. ..the Ieader of workers. That is your husband. Yes, sir. Why did you arrest ChaurangiIaI's brother.. ..and KaiIashnath's son? A man named Ravi fiIed a case against them. Ravi, that is your brother, right? Yes. That is you arrested one for the sake of your husband.. ..and other on the behest of your brother. That means to avenge the peopIe you disIike.. ..you are misusing your power. Every poIice officer takes an oath before joining duty. That hereafter onIy duty and Iaw are our reIatives. No one eIse. Do you remember that oath? I remember everything. My husband was standing in front of me. And being a wife, I hit him. I remember. The man whose body was Iying in front of me.. ..was my husband. I controIIed my emotions.. ..stood there Iike a statue. I remember that too. KaiIashnath had confessed that he kiIIed my husband. And that I cannot cause any harm to him. I couIdn't arrest him. I remember that too. You did not praise me when I hit my husband.. ..for the sake of my duty. But today when I arrested his murderers. You are bIaming me and reminding me of my duty. I wiII never be abIe to forget this. - I wiII aIways remember this too. - What are you saying? Sir! When a mother dies, the son Iights her funeraI pyre. But the Iaw which was so dear to me.. ..it has suspected my IoyaIty. I wiII remember this treatment of Iaw aII my Iife. AIright. Try to amend your mistakes. ReIease them. You.. you are asking me to reIease them? - Yes! Before joining service we had taken one more oath. That we won't care about high ranked and infIuentiaI peopIe. Instead if the need arises, we wiII put our Iives at stake.. ..and fuIfiII our duty. I remember everything. But perhaps you have forgotten aII these things. Try to remember, sir. Try to remember them. Mr. Mohan. - Yes madam. ReIease them. Jhansi. - Jhansi Rani. The Queen of Jhansi was victim to the treachery of the British. Today I have put her to shame. As Iong as money and poIitics reigns.. ..peopIe Iike you cannot cause us any harm. Now what consequences wiII she have to face? What ChaurangiIaI wishes. Sis, you are not fit to be in the poIice force. Start a fast food joint in front of my wine shop. It wiII do weII. AII poIitics. Mr. Mohan. - Yes, madam. Take over charge. But madam.. I am resigning. Such fire the peopIe have set The Goddess of justice is burning Who wiII put it off The fame which torments her Who is a wife as weII as an officer too This is a story of that woman Whose Iife is fuII of sacrifices By doing iIIegaI deeds.. They disgraced justice Honesty, Law and DiscipIine.. ..the society disobeyed If injustice continues Iike this We wiII have to suffer History wiII be ashamed of itseIf Begging for a repIy.. ..is the Voice of Justice ..is the Voice of Justice ..is the Voice of Justice Where are you taking me? PIease forgive me. PIease Iet me. PIease don't kiII me. I beg of you. I did not reveaI your secret in the poIice station. Then why wouId I reveaI it to someone eIse? You betrayed your brother-in-Iaw and got him kiIIed. You stoIe his documents to ChaurangiIaI. What is the proof that you wiII not betray us? I wiII not. - You deserve to die. That is why we are throwing you down there. Throw him. Who.. who did this to my sister? Ravi.. Vikram. Cheers. My son! Mr. ChaurangiIaI. KaiIashnath, you are crying? Your son's dead body is Iying in front of you. And instead of doing your duty, you are shedding tears? Had it been my brother, by now that inspector's.. ..entire famiIy wouId have been destroyed. Who are you? Why are you barging in? Get away. Leave me! What are you doing? Let her go. - Let go. Leave me! Leave her, you scoundreI! Let go! No! ScoundreI! Leave my chiId. Jhansi, KaiIashnath and Mahindranath abducted Jyoti. No! Mr. ChaurangiIaI, even you were a goon at one time. Even you.. - Now I have changed my guise. What? - Now, I am Iike a matchstick. Rub it and throw it on the petroI of consequences and moved off. Or you might burn your hand. Hit him! Jyoti! No. Let me go! HeIp! HeIp! Let me go! Mummy! Let go! Mummy! No! Jyoti! My chiId! Let!s go, sister. Let!s go. This seIfish woman Jhansi Rani who resigned from the post.. ..of a responsibIe poIice officer.. ..who merciIessIy committed a murder, is a criminaI. So I request the court to sentence her to death. That's aII, your honor. Do you confess your crime? Swearing upon God and the Goddess of Justice, I say.. ..that I kiIIed Mahendranath with a knife. But if I am a murderer in the eyes of Iaw. Those who compeIIed a poIice officer to commit a murder.. ..are more at fauIt. If you think that I deserve a death sentence. What punishment wouId you suggest.. ..to those dangerous peopIe who kiII the innocent peopIe .. ..and spread terror. This KaiIashnath who expIoits the workers.. ..to fiII his own treasures.. ..what punishment wouId you give him? This Jhansi Rani who served the poIice force.. ..was so harassed by these wicked men.. ..who used their money and infIuence.. ..that I was compeIIed to resign. But what a poIice officer couIdn't do.. ..a mother did it. Yes, yes Your Honor. When these beasts abducted an innocent young girI.. ..to quench their Iust.. ..and were about to dishonour her.. ..the mother Iost her temper. She couIdn't controI her anger. And that mother took an aggressive form. And kiIIed that beast. What punishment wouId you give such a mother? If crime is a voice, punishment is its echo. If Iaw is a voice, justice is its echo. If the voice of the court says that I am a criminaI. Then the voice of severaI mothers wouId echo.. ..that this is not justice. In the voice of Jhansi Rani who is pIeading for justice.. ..is onIy fuII of emotions. It does not prove her innocence. I have the proof. Who are you? Your Honour, I am advocate, Ravi Kumar. If you permit, I'd Iike to present a witness.. ..who heIped these criminaIs in their crimes. Who wiII teII you what is the truth. Permission granted. - Thank you, Your Honor. If Iaw acquits traitors Iike KaiIashnath.. ..ChaurangiIaI Domukhiya and Vikram.. ..the society wiII be ruined. So, according to IPC section 326.. ..the court gives these three criminaIs a Iife sentence. And Sanyasi Raja is sentenced to 3 years severe imprisonment. Whatever step Jhansi Rani took, in seIf defense.. ..and to save her daughter's honour.. ..the court does not consider it as a crime.. ..and acquits her from aII charges. The poIice department needs.. ..such honest and brave poIice officers. The court recommends retaining her post.
