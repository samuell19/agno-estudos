The 41st millenium The Imperium of Mankind stretches across the entire galaxy. Still, tremendous wars rage at its frontiers. As well as within. Only a merciless authority full of cruelty and scorn is capable of keeping the Imperium together. United in the faith in their god-like Emperor humanity has no alternative than to accept their fate. But mankind changes, Psykers are born. Mutants with supernatural skills. They are the gateway to the Empyrean, a parallel dimension flushed with energy, Which made journeys between the stars possible. But inside the Immaterium the emotions of the living gather and take shape ... Those personified nightmares are haunting mankind as daemons. And their dark gods have only one intention: The subjugation of the substantial universe. Inquisitor Lessus. We will soon exit the Immaterium. The warp abnormality ... it grew bigger. We have never arrived too late. Inquisitor! We regret that we cannot come to your support. Eldar forces are blocking the Strait of Calix. Proceed with your mission. For the Emperor! It is the holy duty of the covertly working Imperial Inquisition to hold this menace at bay. All over the galaxy they are searching for the merest hint of corruption by the rotting seeds of chaos cults. The merciless Inquisitors are authorised to attack the enemies of the Imperium at any time, by any means, to annihilate them. Welcome back, son of the Conclave. (Radio traffic) (Noise) Halt! (Noise) (Radio traffic) Fire at will. (Noise) Unit Three? (Noise) Spotted! He that committeth no sin, on his knees! Come on, Nira. Are you dreaming again? I really wonder what this is all about! Even recruits would be better for this ops. Remember: If they refuse, kill them all. You know our orders. Osmar Adeodatus, Planetary Defence Force Sancta Heroica Theta, Special Forces Legion. Hieronymus VI. von Remus, Sergeant Corris, Wodan Dubrovnik, as well as the absent Oktavian are as of now put under the command of the Planetary Defence Force. What!? During operation 312003 you will be accompanied and supported by Nira Gippus of the Scholastika Psykana, and by myself. A witch! Hell, I like it! What is this operation about? Suspicious subjects are rumoured to have gathered in the old manufactorum inside depth 69. Our assignment is to scan this forbidden gathering and, should the need arise, cleanse and purge it. How much? There will be no pay. This order came from the highest authority: The Inquisition! How can we get to the lowest depth? We have to take the old supply tubes in the north east section of the hive. Thatís why we have to depart as soon as possible. What about the old assembly tunnels inside the... Macharius-wing? Donít they go straight down? Those have not been used for centuries. It is strictly forbidden to disturb the machine spirits. We have someone who gets along with them pretty well. The sooner we finish this job the better it is for all of us. Well, then weíll meet there. I guess I made myself clear. When will you be ready for action? In six hours at the earliest. Three hours! For the Emperor! Into the Eye with the Inquisition! I wonít do any dirty work for them! Come on, letís get the hell out of here while we still can! You can outrun anybody, Wodan. But not them. You know that. Nevertheless... somethingís awry with this. - Why us? - Exactly. We havenít had any big operations recently. And finally this female psyker! I had the feeling all along that she was reading my thoughts. She didnít have a great deal to do with that. Weíll see. Hold this position and prepare yourselves, Iíll tell Oktavian the news. Await my complete report within 24 hours. Signed: Adeodatus Dismissed! (Prayer) One thing Iíd definitely like to know, Wodan. What? Why are you so scared stiff of humans with psionic abilities, but have no reservations regarding such strange guys like him? Oktavian is only able to control machines. I am no fething machine! At least not completely. We still should watch that Nira Gippus. She may be a novice but the Emperor knows what potential lies within her. Here they come, our watchdogs. Very well then, a tech priest. Iíve never trusted those guys. If one can call them human at all. They do not really believe in the Emperor. Hey! He seems to be done, finally. The rites of awakening are finished. The elevator will take us safely to depth 63. Halt! Adeodatus ... I guess you donít have any information regarding this Ñforbidden meetingì, as I happen to know the inner workings of the Inquisition. Considering the military prowess of this penal squad they can be nothing but poorly equipped insurgents. Do not underestimate us, soldier boy. If you even had the faintest idea what we have already seen! Donít underestimate the Inquisition. It is my duty to inform you that I will record any blasphemous and heretical actions and statements! I hope you know that, von Remus. Quite plain. Come on, letís smoke this lair of heretics out. Left flank, Wodan. Room secured. Gas and radiation values are within acceptable ranges. Very good. Weíll advance to the next possible descent location. Oktavian, conduct a deep scan every 10 minutes. The laws of the Administratum do not reach this place and I donít want any surprises! They are only armed with light weapons. Three additional signs right in room behind that door. No surveillance sensors within the perimeter. I cannot access further sectors. Good to know. Must be the walls of the Manufactorum. Probably. Adeodatus. Reporting in. Command HQ? Can you hear me? Adeodatus for command HQ. Can anyone hear me!? Adept Oktavian? Do you feel it, too? I do not feel, psyker. I see. But the eye of the Machine God is... embittered down here. Thatís not a good omen ... And where are the others by the way? Whatís that supposed to be!? They were meant to wait! Stop right there! What in the name of the only true one is your business here? Because of the only true one amongst true ones I have come here. I am searching for my property. One of my working slaves has escaped. Youríre in the wrong place here. We havenít seen anybody. Thatís odd ... I was absolutely sure that he ran in this direction. But you probably would have seen him if you hadnít been so easily distracted. Interesting approach ... Letís hurry up. There may be more of them near. Oktavian, keep an eye on the vicinity. I guess we gathered enough information for the Inquisition. Letís get out of here as soon as possible. Yeah, exactly! Our orders are clear, von Remus. 'Cleanse and purge' - we already bumped off five of them! Yeah, even without knowing if they actually posed a threat to us. I knew it! What? Thereís a strange symbol on their cowls. That confirms our suspicion about this being a forbidden organisation. We have to get deeper into the complex, collect more pieces of evidence for the Inquisition. Oktavian? Anything wrong? Interferences ... Strange interferences ... There is... no... someone was there! After him! Great ... He is moving towards a big maintenance hall. Makkabeus sends me. The preparations have begun. He wants to talk to you before it starts. I will be there. What is it? I guess we have seen enough, soldier. You can earn your badges in another suicide mission. We follow orders, von Remus. We donít retreat until we know what is wrong here. I somehow have the feeling, someone in here had... deeper insights into certain files, eh? Be quiet! I think I heard something. Oktavian? Very weak. Iím on him. Nira? Where's Nira? A psychic shockwave! Weíd better hurry up. Nira? Iím sorry! I didnít mean to do that! Never do that again! What happened? May the Emperor be with us. I... felt dizzy. And then... he was suddenly there. Signa accipio. Approaching. - Damn, cultists! - Charge! Retreat to the hall! Back into the hall! Go! Go! Get them! Go in and win! Nira! Watch out, he's on your back! Damnatus... est! I cannot see you anymore... Maschine empathy. Finish them! Heavy weapon, 12 o'clock! That won't hold them back for long. Let's go! Oktavian. Is this the way that will get us out of here the quickest? It is the one with the least enemy activities. Wodan,... if we ever survive that trip, please remind me to award pleasant Mr. Adeodatus here with some permanent medals! We need an exit, now! Watch out! Someoneís coming! In the name of the Imperator, hold your fire! The seal of the Inquisition. An operative. Things are getting better and better, eh? Youíre lucky I didnít aim any higher or lower. Mhm, just a flesh wound ... Letís hurry, the door can only be opened from inside. Nobodyís here. Good. We have to go back. It will start soon. A lot of sectors are not used by the conclave. When I heard that you fled to the north-eastern complex, I did all I could to hurry up to find you before they did. Conclave? What kind of people are we talking about? You donít know that? No, not really. Strange, this is not the common procedure with missions of this importance. Well, I am sorry for your losses. Unfortunately I lost contact with command. Otherwise I would have guided you to a secret entrance. Thereís no need to feel bad. We didnít lose anybody. Inquisitor Lessus didnít send more? No. Damn you, what is this all about!? One moment. We are almost there. I got myself access to stratetically important points and was able to establish a secret hideout here. Not quite comfortable, but better than to be in the same room with these heretics. Do you have any dressing material? Thereís no need for that. I will personally take care of it later. Do you have a name or... is that top secret, too? Alias: Lechias Well, Lechias... Why donít you tell us why weíre here. Or even better: What do you think why weíre here. You were hired to prevent an unholy ceremony being held threatening the planet and maybe even the whole system. Witch scum then! I knew it, I knew it all along! Not a common sorcerer ... The so called 'Conclave of Ninity' is led by Zyriakus Makkabeus, a traitor, on whose trail we have been for decades. He must be stopped before he is able to put his insane plan into action. What are his exact plans? Ignorance is a value that has to be protected. There may be a reason why you did not get every piece of information, mercenaries ... Sure thing. Otherwise we wouldnít have gotten stuck with that crap here! Itís an... Invocatio Daemonis, isn't it? You could put it that way, but... beware your words and thoughts. We do not want to lure such... dark creatures. For months I have had to fight off this foul spawn that is spread widely everywhere down here. Only too well I know about these nameless things. Anyway. I infiltrated this place to gather information about the scheming of this Makkabeus. But then I lost contact with the HQ and I could only send few data. Probably the assigned Inquisitor doesnít know anything about this situation. That would explain why we were sent down here. Weíre definitely the wrong guys for that mission. Let the Inquisition send their specialists! Yeah, right! Or even the warriors of the Adeptus Astartes! Time is ticking though! A fortunate planetary configuration is in to happen as I have got to know. Pardon!? Does that mean itís all about to start any second and weíre in midst of this crap!? What shall we do? If it is about eliminating the traitor whose name I do not want to repeat, I will volunteer for the mission. Nira and myself are sufficiently armed for this mission. I see, milksop here would like to be the hero, yes? Confess, you knew that all the time! Thatís a stitch-up! Youíre all in cahoots with each other! Didnít you listen to him? It's about Sancta Heroica, my home! What use would the Inquisition have of assigning a bunch of dirty mercenaries to such an important operation? But weíre perhaps only supposed to be a diversion! Personally I donít feel the urge to sacrifice myself for this city or anything else on this ugly world. Lower your weapon, Sergeant. There is no alternative as it seems. In this universe one is sacrificed or sacrifices himself. We could definitely use some reinforcements. Right,... why donít you just inform your superior, Adeodatus? - I... - His secret uplink has no connection since we entered depth 69. Thatís right. I canít send any Vid-Log messages since then. The conclave knows well how to hide themselves. But we have that skill as well. I know a secret passage beneath the old manufactorum leading directly to the inner chambers of the conclaveís lair. There your will find the heads of this heretic hydra. You wonít come with us? An Imperial operative with your experience, your skills, could be very helpful with this. My strength lies in infiltration, not in combat. My skills are rather... unusual. This is not my body. It is the body of rich merchant Reuel Eisenstein, an influential supporter of the conclave. He could move rather freely amongst the heretics. Spys, altering their shape ... I have heard of rumours that the Inquisition had such operatives at its disposal. Enough! Letís go. I anyway have to go back soon. Otherwise they would get suspicious. And under no circumstance leave the way I showed you! Donít worry, Oktavian has already stored the way. Very well. Voluntas imperatoris perficiatur. What used to be manufactured here, by the way? Everything the Imperium needs for its defence. Tanks, weapons, ammunition. Why then was this manufactorum shut down? Nobody knows that exactly nowadays. There are many rumours of how it is connected to the great plague centuries ago. But there are many old wivesí tales about this old section of the hive anyway. What a waste ... I will send a prayer to the Omissiah for forgiveness.. Nira! Whatís wrong? It's... itís alright. She suddenly collapsed. Donít worry. One gets used to it. We have to move on. They... they screamed. Screaming? Who was screaming? I donít know. Many of them... many. But when you came,... they fell silent. Youíre not trying to come on to me, are you? No! I took a vow. Do not pollute my thoughts. But it is like you were surrounded by an aura of calmness ... It keeps bad spirits away. A foreign race gave it to me after rescuing me. Evil xenos tricks!? If you like to call it that way. I can feel it protecting me, but... Iím willing to lend it to you if it helps you to focus your thoughts on our mission. It is wonderful. Still, keep it hidden. What's keeping you groxes? Whatís wrong? Listen. Which way now? That is the way. So we now hand over our fate to a playing card. Like some inquisitors, too. You wanted to talk to me, Inquisitor Makkabaeus? Yes, honoured Eisenstein. I hope my two guards did not disturb thou. But after that strange raid - During which thou as well hast been wounded, as I can see - we are forced to act more cautiously. Those intruders ... They could be a vanguard! Perhaps the puritans among my order are already breathing down my neck. They rather came across me like... a bunch of... shabby archeotech raiders. Yes, that may be. But thou shalt never trust the outer appearance ... As I see, you already ordered the staff being taken out of the stasis chamber. I thought this should only happen when the time has come? I only had it brought into my chamber to study it. Do not worry. The splinter essence inside will not fade that soon. Far from it. It is alive, very alive. Please... be careful with it. I spent my entire wealth for this precious staff being taken to Sancta Heroica. All our hardship will be remunerated with the undying blessing of the Emperor, my friend. Soon, we will begin. The stars are on the exact same coordinates as... 1000 years ago when Bíewesh Gíguor - his false name shall be damned - spread his foul wings above this planet. Today, we will bring him down once and for all. We will force him into the righteous chains of faith. And we will use his power against his rotten kind. His breed will burn! And his retinue will be erased from the face of the universe! Upon my name Makkabaeus. Sic fiat et non aliter. Yes. Yeess, it shall come. Now, make thy way as soon as possible to one of the protection chambers. And place a personal purity seal upon the door. During the ceremony huge amounts of psychic energies will be released. It may come to pass that unasked creatures of the warp may haunt us. Prepare thyself for that. In a few hours everything will be over, and then we will be able to continue our research. Eisenstein, thou shalt lay thyself to rest anyway. Thou look weakened. The wound? Yees, ... it seems like that. Then set out. I will personally commit a deed that wilst go down in the annals of the Imperium! I donít get it! We even have to crawl through this soup here! Und da vorn wird das ganze auch noch tiefer. Hope your sensors are right, Oktavian. There is nothing beneath this dirty broth! Rats, Dubro, just rats ... I just feel like having a ratburger now. Do you remember the times on Necromunda, Corris? Those were the best ones! There the sewer was the most contaminated place. Yeah! Those were real rats! Itís ok. Just a dizzy spell ... Take me to my chambers. I have to attend to some personal affairs. But... Thereís no but! I will follow you to the shelter, soon. I will make it. One thing is bothering me, soldier ... And that would be? If that is supposed to be depth 69 above us, where the Horus are we now? Weíre still in depth 69. But maybe the manufactorum sunk because of hive quakes. My hive has exactly 191 heights and 69 depths. Remember that, merc. All be quiet. A... warp storm... approaches. Weíd better hurry up. What... What is happening... to me? It is exceptionally quiet in here ... That must be the realm of the inner circle. Be alert, it cannot be far. Letís bring this to an end! Seem as if they were less fortunate than we were. Come on, onwards. (Summoning formula) Strange things are happening here. This summoning is not what it seems to be ... Kill them! Kill them quickly! We must go on. Well done, Nira ... Keep them at bay! In the name of the damned Inquisition, I hereby adjourn this meeting! You shall not... interrupt us now ... Not now! Die, heretic! Nooo! You misguided... you fools! If this was not what it looked like, ... what was it? Nira? I... I donít know ... You could be right. Wodan saw an inquisitorial rosette pinned on Makkabaeusí cowl shortly before he burnt the corpse. Those were no followers of Chaos, at least no common ones. I donít know what we blundered into and I donít feel the need to know it. But when we reach the surface weíll take the first available transport off this planet and get the hell out of here. We could take you with us, Nira. ... as we will have an esplanade soon. I will hand over your engrams to your brothers having them brought to Mars and laid down within the machine godís temple, as you told me to. We have to go now, old friend, we have to go now. Omnissias te per tenebras ducebit. Hurry. The same way before it is blocked. I donít give a damn what happened to patrol 9. Hold your positions! Too late ... Flesh... it is so weak... so... weak. Stay here, cowardly grots! Go go! Allís clear. Do you this taste, too? Tastes like metal or something. Whereís Osmar got to? Oh... The brave soldier is injured and doesnít want to show it. Iíll pick him up ... What is that!? Why didnít you warn us? Whatís wrong with you, Nira? You did feel it! Yes, there... there was something. In the door. But it is not only in the door. It is everwhere! Itís no use! Itís growing again! Go on! Weíll find another exit! Come on, soldier. Silence, my brothers! Silence! Yes. The ceremony has been interrupted. You know what to do, brothers. Do you think... theyíll make it on their own? Corris is a tough one to break. Heíll make it. Iím not sure if we came down that way ... Come on. We have to stay together. Do you by any chance happen to know where the exit is? Of course... Thereís where all those friendly guys with the masks come from. Thatís a way out of here. Wait here. Damn! Speak of the enemy. - How many? - Too many for the two of us. Do you see the stairs over there? Yeah. If we move fast, weíll make it. - Iíll watch your back. - Good. Go! There the killers! Judge them! Go down the stairs, quickly! Come on, come on ... Damn. Take cover! Whatís wrong, Wodan? Look at that. Seventy-one. This hive seems to have more depths than people know. We got lost in any way. These markings doesnít help us on neither. Come on. Fortunately the whole ceiling didnít come down. Thatíll buy us time. Come on. Good. Good, good, good. Are you alright? I'm fine, I'm fine ... Okay,... which way? Which way ... Donít panic ... Just donít panic. What in the name... !? Which way? Which corridor? What ...? This way. Come on. We have to take this way. Looks like a market square ... or something like that. That is no market square. The plague that is said to have raged down here, was a soul plague. The faithful versus the heretics and the heretics versus the faithful. Thatís why they sealed the lowest depths and sank them into oblivion. Letís keep moving. Please. Well, Sergeant... Whatís the deal with your playing card? In the past, in my regiment, they called me 'Spade-Ace', because I always had it with me. Itís my lucky charm, Adeodatus. Got me out of the slavery - this little playing card. My owner was drunken when he raised his bet, and - well - itís been a long time. Sometimes it feels like two, three eternities. Well,... shortly after I entered active duty in the Imperial Guard. I was twelve back then. Those guys again! Run, Adeodatus - run! Hell, I like it. Praise Him on Terra! Looks like somebody was here recently. The conclave actually digged very deep as it seems. Either for research or for worshipping. Probably it was a bit of both. Hey, Hiero! I hear them again. The voices. So many. Your charm, it doesnít help! Wait, donít do that. Who knows what will happen if you drop it. The air and the walls weep of psychic energy, no need to be gifted to - It is not a gift - it is a curse! Hold on, Nira. Weíll find a way out. Poor thing ... Damn! They have welded the door! Iíll go for reinforcements. They will be purged for their deed. Who are you? No... no... no, it canít be. Y-you cannot... Y-you just cannot have found another host. No! It canít be! No! We better blast our way to the other direction. And better be fast! Thereís no use in praying Adeodatus. Actions are the prayers of a soldier and victories his offerings. Get in there! Letís hope thereís a way out on the other side. Corris? Iím sorry. His orders. His orders! How far upwards do these stairs actually lead? I hope far. The assembly tunnels to the next depth could be sealed. But we will see. Wodan? Hiero! Blasted rats. Wodan! Damn! (Prayer) You, too, will die! We all have to die. Some sooner! Others later ... Ignorant! Iíd better die now for the cause than later for HIM! Whatís that supposed to mean?! Speak, heretic! We have failed. HE is free again, and HE thirsts... Where is he? I donít know. But I will find it out. Listen, Nira. You will pass that bridge, take the stairs. Youíll make it, you know that. Youíre stronger and more powerful than anyone of us. But I cannot- You have to! In this universe one will either be sacrified or sacrifice one-self. The truth is we canít even chose the way we die on our own. You canít have gone far. No! He couldn't bear themmm. The visions I showed him of my realmmm! Daemon! Thy weaponsss are worthlessss against the omnipotenccce of the change. My host has grown strong. Who... ? Ssso easy to manipulate ... We jussst have to follow you humansss to strengthen ourselvesss at your sssoul fire. Your friends did entertain me for a while ... Lechias? Thou art the lassst one. Ssso she cannot be far. My plan did not foresssee you to shield her that well from me. Time isss running out. But this game isss over now! (Prayer) Spare thy vigour, young Noviccce. Do not resist the fate I choossse for thou. Daemon! Thou shalt not be here! I am here because this is my world! I came back to claim what once was mine! And now I shall end what I begun. Tremendous lies! Thou roam upon the soil of the almighty Emperor. If I cannot stop thee, his legions will in his holy name! How right thou arrrt! Therefor I mussst open the gate to my realm. And for this I need thy power! Thou arrrt not alone ... Now I sense you, old friend. Now I see thou. Even after I crushed thy body, thy will tries to cross my plansss? Just as I frussstrated thine, Farseer Vintog Phaer? How ironic ... Unusual psy activities inside the depths of Sancta Heroica. So this is where it will all begin again ... Transfer the coordinates! Right from the beginning thou hast seen through my plans. Thou hast watched me choose my pieces. From the addicted changeling, to the megalomaniac hunter to the sleeping ssstorm of power. And now everything is over as thou brought thy puny being into the game. So, this big is thy sacrifice. The Sphere Gate of Carmanshybed might be closssed eternally for me, but thy soul also is lost forever. Thou might have tricked me, but in the plans of the ever-changing defeats are not included. As only Chaosss is eternal! I predicted that we wonít be too late. We are too late. It is said that there are more daemons lurking in the dark Than there are stars shining in the sky. But there will be the day, the stars will stop existing.
