For Soseki Natsume, nothing represents better the civilization of the 20th century than the train. Hundreds of people crammed in a box that rumbles along heartlessly. All taken at uniform speed to the same station... He wrote: "Modern civilization uses every possible means to develop individuality, and having done so, tries everything in its power to stamp it out. It allots a few square yards to each person, and tells him that he is free to lead his life as he pleases within that area. At the same time it erects railings around him, and threatens him with all sorts of dire consequences if he should dare to take but one step beyond their compass... The railway train which blunders ahead blindly into the pitch of darkness is one example of the very obvious dangers which are bound in modern civilization." inside outside, host guest the role assigned like the role assumed at first seems fixed carefully enforce, scrupulously performed but once the initiation rites have passed from one closure to another the inside surreptitiously draws its elements from outside without being any less inside meticulously adapted, extended, and transformed nothing is natural, for the natural in its most natural is carefully created look at how long this fellow has been sitting here our original face has never been hidden Ko doja in the matted room a solitary painting barely line, barely shape that frail shadow of a bodhisattva shading its human frame the mask: what makes the face into a molding of society and history performing one's gender is part of the boring social contract commenting on the sexual ambivalence in girls comic books, Imaizumi Fumiko insists that girls' "deepest desire is to be neither male nor female" they take on a sexless role that departs from the adult woman's subservient role in life, feeling that reality and dreams can be reversed by changing male and female appearances. only when behavior carefully rehearsed becomes collective do difference fully take on the individual color the relentless pressures to confirm the endless demand for freedom GISHIKI like nature, human nature itself is carefully molded GISHIKI the choreography of everyday activities and of every stage role has been kept alive for centuries GISHIKI suddenly here I am carried by the cadence and a swift metamorphosis of the line its continuity, tensions, improvisations and repetitions the exact train system mirrors the structure of the society it serves machines and people work in mutual accord once the choice where destination is made it can be altered at any time in any way during the journey for the fare registered by the machine can always be readjusted by the human hand itineraries a modified has so desired without any fuss or distrust for no one seeks to beat the system HUMAN TIME - MACHINE TIME when treated with mutual respect HUMAN TIME - MACHINE TIME human and machine share the same devotion to duty the infinite lines of railways regulating the urban space On the Noh dance, Okakura kakuzo decreed: "the standard of excellence is an infinite suggestiveness, naturalism the one thing to be condemned."

But for the last few centuries, one has no longer seen the shadow clearly. Whatever one sees is only a weak and doubtful resemblance." look at how long this fellow has been sitting here our original face has never been hidden Ko doja to survive, spirituality would have to come to us from all the ordinary images of life It is said that when Shakyamuni lost his ordinary sight one branch of a plum tree blossom in the snow “the principle underlying [Japanese] cultural forms,” says Nyozekan Hasegawa, “is the control of feeling” a control ideally meant to intensify emotion without flooding the recipient bridge, train, passenger what's in motion? windows closed muted soundtrack no body movement only the erotic rocking of human against machine landscape, image, wagon, viewer what's moving in the midst of stillness? traveling anew with video images put on line displayed on screen from one spectacle to the next mobility of human sense possession of window images the landscape wires now gleams now the longer seen morphing changing from one minute to the next shooting in rural Japan one often shoots in corporate mentality collective highlights collective shots collective climax collective photography a night heron sitting tense on one leg ready to strike in clear water with one single swoop passing through the torii gate, one encounters an inside Japan only to be made more aware of an outside Japan torii gate setting off the mundane from the spiritual what we see passes away the more evident becomes the background while the minor details go on shifting what is seen and heard the other dimension: gaseous and liquid because what appears evident to the eye is a straight line normal perception is solid, geometric, clearcut and divisive Direct pointing to the human heart seeing one's nature becoming Buddha Written by the 83-year-old priest Hakuin sitting beneath the Sala tree wuthout his glasses "vast emptiness, nothing holy" ingrained in modern social interaction and political performance ritual is not compatible with industrial speed to perform a ritual one must slow down WOMEN'S TIME JAPAN'S TIME Japanese women of old are said to have this impassive look of the mask and to live like masks, with their deepest energies turn inward surface is surface and yet boundless is the depth of the surface that neither conceals nor reveals what if, in this journey, like Enchi and Soseki, I were to regard events as parts of a Noh play and the people as its actors?

This filthy blind old shavepate adds more foulness [ugliness] still to foulness” Hakuin Zenji May 19. Democracy was crushed by state power. The parliament forcibly adopted the revised Treaty binding Japan to the American security system. June 16, 1960 the Asahi evening news and the Mainichi Daily News reported the death of Kamba Michiko during a bloody demonstration against the Government of Prime Minister Kishi and the signing of the renewed Japan-US Security Treaty Kamba Michiko, a student of Tokyo University and a well-known leader of the 20,000 Zengakuren students who besieged the legislative building, had previously been arrested for taking part in the earlier demonstration at Haneda to prevent the prime minister from leaving for the United States. The official narratives unanimously condemned the violence of the event that shook and shocked the nation, while alternative voices blamed the ultranationalist for having set the demonstrators afire by attacking them ferociously. Such an insurrection - also referred to as "Bloody leftwing riots in Japan" - happening before President Eisenhower's scheduled arrival in Tokyo was said to have appalled Washington and America's president who declared "he would not permit unpleasant incidents... to interfere with the goodwill tour he was undertaking to improve the climate of international understanding. Upon looking at how time is expressed in writing and how a death can express the passing of a historical age and its people, Kenzaburo Oe particularly recalls the death of Tsuburaya Kokichi, a young runner in the Olympics, who committed suicide in 1968 because, in his own words, the man was "too tired to run" for national prestige. But in the history of women's resistance and of women pathmakers of the 60s, it is the name of Kamba Michiko that comes to many women's lips as I inquire about the one political figure that strikes their memory. Kamba Michiko's death may be said to have marked the turning point for the image the world had of Japan. With the repression of a civic society, what was then launched was the new image of Japan as a corporate society for which the only way to progress was the Western way. coed killed in diet demonstration More than 400 hurt, 56 students arrested in melee near building Highly advanced and yet not independent a global economic power struggling today to reorient itself to turn to what Asia without turning its back on the West "Ambivalent Japan": isolated from other Asian nations and confined to Her half scrutable strangeness by the West.

The determination to never wage a war again, as Kenzaburo Oe remarks, is a resolve adopted not by innocent people but people stained by their own history of territorial invasion ritual on-screen whenever it happens in a context dominated by a machine which one defies the very rhythm feeding that machine's needs video time: a temporal trap individual inertia as the result of ever increased speed of programmed agency I'm inside the train looking up at a wide sky moving on wireless bootless and black Kisho Kurokawa spoke of Japanese aesthetics as being primarily two-dimensional and gray He laid focus on temporal intervals, intermediary zones and silent spaces; on the necessity to create with the ma of things and events, for a person without ma is scorned as a stupid fellow, one who lacks calm and is unable to tune in with the gray zone of Japanese culture images have come upstream toward the traveler they appear on a screen with each step front foot back foot one moves with them one stops by the road to chat with them and they know how to show certain things but cannot always tell why they show things the way they do He wrote: "No one knows where and when this dewlike existence will drop into the grass."
