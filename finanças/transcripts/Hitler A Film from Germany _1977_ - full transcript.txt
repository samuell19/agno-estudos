The goIden age... ...paradise, saved from the great fIood by human strength... ...and concentration the essentiaIs of chastisementand ceremonies The German dream of death for a new Iife afterwards Away with the maIpractice of false prophets... ...with the selfish prostitution of our most sacred instincts... ...passions and desires from our Iegends... ...the so-caIIed sociology of dwarfish races Destroy what is unworthy... ...exterminate the superstitions of science, technology and faIse reIigions It concerns the blood-memories of our inner eye The souI of our blood becomes the worId's conscience... ...hard and merciIess... ...through us the savioursof world and cosmos for aII time The twilight of humanity begins with us ( A pupiI of the worId ice theory ) ( A pupiI of the worId ice theory ) ln this war we must never fall into the stupor of objectivity... ...which has brought much misfortune on the German nation in its history When this war started, our eyes were solely turned towards our nation... ...everything to serve her; what is good must be preserved and encouraged What is bad must be eliminated and cut off With a burning heart and a cool head... ...we must resolve to deal with the problems of this period of the war Thus we shall take the path to our ultimate victory... ...which is founded in our belief in the F?hrer ( GoebbeIs, SportpaIast, BerIin, 18th February, 1943 ) He expects from us an effort which will put all previous efforts in the shade lf we ever unwaveringly believed in victory... ...then we must do so in this hour of national reflection and inner uplift We see it within touching distance; all we have to do is grasp it We must only summon up the determination... ...to subordinate everything to its service, this is the law of the hour And that's why from now on our password must be: ''Now people rise, and storm break loose!'" On the 2nd July, 1934... ... l was sent, with the best wishes of the minesweeper commander... ...to the naval section of the War Ministry in Berlin I was to report there and then report to the ChanceIlery I traveIIed with some unease and with mixed feelings from KieI to BerIin At the War Ministry I was sent to the navaI chief-of-staff ...who received me amiabIe and introduced me to some high officers... ...including AdmiraI Reader... ...and War Minister von BIomberg After answering various questions... ... l was ordered to report to AdoIf HitIer the next day Report at 10.00 to SS Oberf?hrer and Adjutant Schaub I got up at six, cIeaned and brushed my best uniform... ...and was ready at eight to report At 09.30 I arrived at WiIheImstrasse... ...waited a moment, drew a deep breath... ...then marched to the ChanceIIery gates I was escorted to a courtyard near Hitler's apartment... ...and handed over to the SS-man on duty He took me to the SS Escort Commando guardroom Two SS-men were pIaying chess They Iooked at me rather scepticaIly Later a few civiIians came... ...and introductions began When it became known that I was to be HitIer's vaIet... ...a general discussion began and severaI matters were considered Some of the peopIe were especiaIIy friendly to me I Iearned that the F?hrer was in East Prussia... ...visiting President von Hindenburg... ...to give him fuIl details of the R?hm putsch The aircraft was due back in BerIin at three At Iast the airport reported: ''The F?hrer's aircraft has just landed'" The room sprang to Iife AImost everyone vanished in a fIash I asked what their duties were... ...and heard that each Iooked after a particuIar place... ...resposibIe for security in the drive, the street, and so on I asked someone... ...where l couId stand to get a good view of the F?hrer's arrivaI Just as l went to the door... ...HitIer waIked past, Iess than a metre fom me I stood to attention and his deep voice greeted me: Heil! After haIf an hour, Adjutant Schaub came in and said to me... ...the F?hrer was too busy to see me, l should report tomorrow I stayed in the guardroom for a bit... ...and got to know nearIy everyone... ...including Kempe, who Iater became HitIer's driver... ...who was very friendIy and invited me to his quarters Kempe had a smaIl car at his disposal... ...and that evening we went on a tour of BerIin Two other SS-men came with us... I caIIed a haIt at midnight, as I had to be wide awake next morning So Kempe drove me back to my quarters in the barracks It had been a heavy day... ...though l'd not reached my goal SeveraI more days passed On the fifth day, SA Gruppenf?hrer Br?ckner came and said: ''Where's that water-rat? The F?hrer is waiting for him'" Br?ckner took me upstairs to the private rooms of the F?hrer ...asked me to enter, and stayed outside Now l was standing aIone in the doorway The room before me was fiIIed with a soft, subdued Iight Behind a Iong tabIe, covered with papers, books and other things... ...and iIIuminated by a standard Iamp which cast its Iight in a pooI... ...stood, his arms foIded, Adolf HitIer I reported to him: ''Seaman First-CIass KarI-WiIheIm Krause, First Minesweeper FlotiIIa!" During this, HitIer came up to me and greeted me with a handshake He asked if I knew the reason I was there I said yes He asked about my background and whether l'd Iike to enter his service He asked me, if l was a member of the National SociaIist Party... ...but before I couId say no, he gave the answer himself: ''The navy is not permitted any poIiticaI activity. Just as weIl" They had prepared the room for me in the ChanceIIery and HitIer inspected it In his presence l had to test the bed for length, as l'm taIl... ...and than I received two Iight- coIoured Iounge suits and a dark one Then, when Hitler was in the garden with some guests, I was ordered to him It was just a week earlier, as one of the SS Escorts toId me... ...that Hitler had suddenIy got up from a simiIar gathering... ...and gave by telephone the order to shoot the SA leader R?hm WelI, then, now I stood before him He took two garden chairs; he decIined my heIp, saying: ''No, Ieave that to me. You wiII have to do this often enough.'' He placed the chairs in the middIe of the garden, facing each other Then he toId me to sit down; I sat exactly opposite to him He said: ''You are a saiIor and I shalI not put you on oath, I reIy on you. ''What you observe here concerns no one. You are responsibIe onIy to me." ''You may receive orders through my adjutant. ''Apart from that, nobody has the right to give you orders." I was then responsibIe for Hitler's personaI things: his cIothing... ...later for his meaIs; I don't mean the cooking but the serving The Berlin househoId was run by Herr Kannenberg and his wife In Munich there was Frau Winter... ...and on the Obersalzberg, firstly HitIer's sister, Frau RaubaI The daiIy routine in BerIin... ...remained unchanged in the first year; untiI 1937, that is Before retiring... ...to his realIy private rooms on the first fIoor... ...HitIer aIways toId me when to wake him ''I shaII get up at nine-thirty... ''...but the newspapers must be outside the door by eight'' Often a handshake In the first year, waking was aIways at nine-thirty I answered: "I wish you a restfuI night." He always Iocked himseIf in His rooms on the first fIoor of the ChanceIIery... ...consisted of a private study with a library... ...his bedroom and the bath In the first year, waking was newspapers and messages... ...were placed on a stooI outside the door by the duty SS-man Later that became my task; then the SS-man... ...woke me, gave me the messages and newspapers... ...which I pIaced on the stooI HitIer onIy put his hand outside... ...the door bareIy opened and he groped for the papers The stool had to be in the right pIace In the first years, there was no beIl connecting us I had to go to his bedroom and knock Then say: ''Good morning, F?hrer, it is nine-thirty", for example When the beII was put in, I had to press the button three times... ...to ring the belI at the head of his bed Then he pressed the button on his bedside table three times Only then did I knock an the door and teII him the time of day He answered "Thanks", "Thank you'', or "Thank you very much" From that I'd guess his mood RareIy did he express any speciaI wish After waking him, I went to the kitchen... ...and prepared his breakfast Only the miIk was heated by the duty cook Breakfast was always the same: two cups of warm milk... ...as many as ten Leibnitz biscuits... ...and a haIf bar of bitter chocoIate, broken up The milk was kept warm with a coffee-heater If he had been awakened at nine-thirty... ...the beIl wouId ring at 09.52 or 09.53 I carried the tray to his bedroom and from there to the Iibrary He opened the bedroom door It was up to me to open the other doors Since being awakened... ...HitIer had bathed, shaved and dressed He rang the beIl when he put on his jacket Whatever time he was awakened... ...his toiIet aIways took about twenty minutes He shaved hemself, using two razors... ...the second for a final shave New bIades daiIy, so he required two bIades a day He used Hobby-horse LiIies'-miIk soap, Pieri shaving-cream... ...Arrow-ring skin-cream and Birch-water hair tonic He tried another brand, but went back to Birch-water He used Pine-needIe bath cubes With breakfast, I usuaIIy spoke first; sometimes he did I said: "Morning, F?hrer.'' If he was in a bad mood, I just said: ''Morning.'" then his repIy was: "Good morning'", or onIy "HeiI'" I repIied: '"Heil", without adding anything He breakfasted standing in the library... ...gIancing through the latest German news agency reports... ...which I took in with the breakfast I took the opportunity to submit the menu for luncheon The first course was always the dish for his guests Then the vegetarian courses... ...from which he wouId make a seIection for himseIf Sometimes he'd request something different, Iike poached eggs Regarding the dish for his guests, he would ask: ''Does the dessert come after that?'' Breakfast Iasted three to five minutes Then HitIer went to his officiaI study in the ChancelIery In the first years, we had coffee at the HoteI Kaiserhof at four-thirty A few security men waIked across the WiIhelmpIatz to the hoteI HitIer, with one or two of his aides and l drove to a side entrance... ...where the manager and the security men were waiting to escort us There was aIways a corner tabIe reserved for us G?ring or GoebbeIs usualIy attended, but rareIy together The meetings Iasted untiI about seven, then we went back to the ChanceIIery... ...where everything was being prepared for the evening meaI During the first years, many actors and opera singers were invited The dinner itsseIf was quite informal During the meal, l submitted a Iist of up to haIf a dozen fiIms... ...which couId be shown on that evening; German and foreign films HitIer then decided which fiIms shouId be screened on that evening After dinner and a quick cup of coffee in the smoking room... ...the music room was converted for the fiIm show The equipment was exactly the same as in a pubIic cinema Films were suppIied by the Propaganda Ministry and fiIm distributors As many as three fiIms were shown per evening If HitIer didn't Iike one, another has to be substituted immediateIy He broke off the projection saying: ''Stop! Utter rubbish! Next, please'" Until the war, HitIer viewed every German and foriegn film... ...and eventhose films which the Propaganda Ministry... ...had not yet passedfor pubIic showing HitIer himseIf then made the decision But during the war HitIer Iooked at nothing but newsreeIs The newsreels were shown silent whiIe an adjutant read out the text... ...and Hitler decided on the words; often he changed them From 1942 onwards, Hitler didn't even Iook at the newsreeIs But he stiII Iistened to records of Franz Lehar and Johann Strauss For exampIe: The Merry Widow or Die Fledermaus After the projection, towards midnight, they returned to the smoking room... ...where the orderIies had arranged a cosy coffee corner in the meantime Everybody sat down quite informaIIy and liveIy discussions started AII sorts of aIcohoIic drinks, coffee, cakes and sandwiches were served here guests even smoked, but not in his immediate vicinity Every subject under the sun was discussed, except poIitics Even Iadie's fashions One couId see that HitIer was reaIIy a very genial host I heard this not onIy from German visitors, but from foreign guests I was usuaIly present and couId hear and see everything... ...because I was onIy one or two metres away from HitIer's tabIe It usuaIly didn't break up untiI two or three in the morning After the guests had gone, I Iaid out the latest evening papers... ...and the News Agency buIIetins, which HitIer studied cIoseIy In the meantime a cup of vaIerian tea and a smaIl bottIe of brandy... ...were placed, by me, on his bedside tabIe After HitIer had read the papers and Iatest news, he went to his rooms above His daily routine remained the same until 1938 Until then, we never spent Sunday in BerIin, we went to the ObersaIzberg We want to see our F?hrer! ( Count Ciano's visit to BerIin to sign the German-ItaIian Axis Pact. 1 936 ) We are still overwhelmed by the scene on Wilhelmplatz From thousands of voices... ...the Deutschlandlied rose towards heaven This song became a solemn vow... ...confirming the action of those who have brought about this alliance and now thousands of eyes are turning... ...from the Wilhelmplatz and from the sidestreets... ...across to the Reichs Chancellery, to the door of that balcony (Radio Iinkup with alI war fronts, 24th December, 1942 ) This is StaIingrad, here is the VoIga front CaIIing the Lapland front We are in the barracks in the Finish forest Southern France, our air forces This is a miIitary airfieId in southern France on Christmas Eve, 1937, HitIer had a suprise for me He was at his Munich apartment, Prinzregentenstrasse 16 I was invited to a famiIy celebration... ...and waited impatiently for HitIer to reIease me for the evening But he returned to the room where the gifts were laid out... ...to choose one more present We then packed it together, squatting on the carpet As he heId a knot, for a joke I wound the stringround his thumb And in return, Iaughing... ...he tapped me in fun on the back of the neck with his Ieft hand He toId me to deliver the package, but first to Iay out his dinner jacket When I Iooked at him increduIousIy he said: "Yes, my dinner jacket'' CaIIing Crete once more CaIIing the BIack Sea ports This is the Black Sea port on Crimean peninsuIa We ask comrades to join us in the beautifuI Christmas caroI: SiIent night, hoIy night He asked me to doubIe-check aII the preparations... ...the brewing of the punch... ...and that nobody was standing outside the door, as usuaI... ...and that onIy one Munich policeman was on duty outside the house When he said that, we went quietIy downstairs We realIy hurried Iike thieves through the house to a waiting taxi Nobody had noticed us, which pleased Hitler very much I was about to take my pIace next to the driver... ...when HitIer puIled me onto the back seat, on his right-hand side He whispered to me some destinations, which I passed on to the driver So we crossed and recrossed Munich that Christmas Eve... ...travelIing from one pIace to the other... ...ending up at the LuitpoId Caf? Rather surprised, l wondered what he wanted there at that hour The taxi driver must have been puzzIed, he didn't know his passenger He was visibIy reIieved when we paid him off at the LuitpoId Caf? The moment he had the money in his hand, he drove off at top speed He must have thought we were a coupIe of madmen Perhaps he wasn't quite wrong, because l found in uncanny, too Then without going into the Caf?, we waIked back to the K?nigIicher PIatz As I feIt responsibIe for his security, I turned occasionalIy... ...which made him remark: ''Come, come waIk beside me. You needn't be afraid because of me. ''Nobody would beIieve that AdoIf HitIer strolIed about Munich aIone." Whenever someone passed, he onIy Iowered his head or Iooked aside And, reaIly, no one did recognize him... ...we reached our flat in the Prinzregentenstrasse On our way, icy sIeet began to falI He had onIy supported himseIf on my shouIder before... ...but finaIIy we waIked arm in arm, as he wore new patent-Ieather shoes WelI, somebody must have noticed something HimmIer and Rattenhuber who were in charge of the Escort Commando... ...reproached me the next day because I had not informed anybody And Himmler gave me orders that in future... ...even if Hitler forbade me, I must report these things to the Escort But I never obeyed this order from HimmIer, the Reichsf?hrer SS This is Radio Moscow broadcasting in German The first month of the New Year 1943... ...ended with the crushing of the Hitlerite forces... ...which were encircled in the western-central district of Stalingrad Commanding Vice-Field Marshal of the German army, Paulus... ...his entire staff and a further fifteen generals surrendered Astronomers of the University of CaIifornia in BerkeIey... ...disovered a gaIaxy which is the furthest away from us This enormous system consisting of over one thousand suns... ...is at a distance of eight miIIiard Iight years The Iight which reaches us from there... ...was sent on its journey to us... ...at a time when our sun and its pIanets did not even exist 3 C 123 appears on photographs... ...as a blurred IittIe spot of irreguIar shape ...that presumabIy represents other gaIaxies of the same group The interpretation of the spectoscopic data brought a surprise: That object shows the greatest dispIacement of red of the spectrum... ...which was ever observed in any gaIaxy Therefore, 3 C 123... Iight away from us... ...and is five to ten times bigger than our own MiIky Way In the opinion of Professor Dr. Horst L?b of Giessen... ...6% of aII suns in the universe... ...are circIed by pIanets which could be inhabited by some Iiving beings This estimated percentage appears relativeIy smaII... ...but the number of inhabited heavenIy bodies wouId stiIl be enormous... ...because there are, roughIy estimated, 100 miIliard MiIky Ways... ...which consist of about fifty miIliard stars each If one considers the concept of the infinity of the universe... ...to its logicaI concIusion... ...one arrives at unreaIity... ...because infinity is nothing but a mathematicaI expression of unreaIity If one tries to imagine that the MiIky Way... ...consists of more than a miIIiard fixed stars... ...many with a diameter greater than the distance between earth and sun... ...and that it does not represent the fixed poIe of the cosmos... ...but races at a speed of six hundred kiIometres per second... ...a thousand times faster than a sheII, to some pIace or other... ...then the assumption that alI this... ...could have anything to do with reality is reduced to a mere fantasy The picture becomes even more unreaI if one foIIows the Iatest conjecture.. . ...that the sum of aII conglomerations of stars... ...forms a cIose finite system... ...in the shape of a rotation- eIIipsoid... ...then one cannot disregardthe idea... ...that it is nothing but one of the moIecuIes... ...from which greater bodies are constructed The universe as a molecuIe The molecuIe as an universe What did Stifter write about the Jew Abdias and his blind daughter Ditha?
