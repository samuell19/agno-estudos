I know about ships. They are wood and metal, and nothing else. They don't have souls. They don't have wills of their own and they don't talk back. Or so I told myself a thousand times. A thousand times I went over it all from the beginning. The beginning, like almost everything else about me, went back to the war... to motor gunboat 1087, and to George Hoskins. We spent nearly all the war in Coastal Forces. The 'Beat-Up Boys', they used to call us. That name tells you just about all you need to know. Number one! Stop wings. Headland's on the starboard bow. About a mile. We'll go dead slow, then creep round the point. Then, we should see the target. Yes, and the battery'll see us. You'll have to let them have it first time, or else! What about the minefield? As you fire, I'll rev up. We have to turn her on a sixpence, or we'll be right in it. I hope we don't miss the Gasworks and hit the Casino. - Why? - They owe me 50 quid! Stand by, lads. Any moment now. I'll mark the target with tracer from aft, then, you let 'em have it. Okay, I'll take over this one. We're being set down a lot, sir. Strong inshore tide. - Shall I increase a bit? - She'll just make it. Don't want to make any more noise than this. We'll not get round without starting wings. I'll lay you six to four, sir. In shillings. Taken. Two points starboard, cox'n. Aye aye, sir! Odds on chance! Keep her out, cox'n! Shame to take the money, cox'n. Stand by, Number One. B Gun! Fire, fire, fire! We've got the tote double up! - Right up! - Start wings! Hard a'port! Check, check, check! Come on, my beauty! They've lost the range! Ever known a boat to turn like that, cox'n? She's a beauty, sir. Any other boat would have had us in that minefield. She's a honey, old 1087! - Rejoin squadron! - Aye aye, sir! You're quick with the score, Number One. We ought not claim them until reconnaissance confirms it. No doubt about this lot, sir. No, I suppose not. She's not got a bad record, old 1087. Best team in the business, Randall and Hoskins. I've been thinking, sir. We've picked up a few gongs between us now. Why not chalk them up too? Um... D.S.O., one. - Oh, and bar. Sorry, sir. - Not at all. D.S.C., one, yours truly. Um, D.S.M., three, etc. Look pretty good, wouldn't it? No! No point hiding your light under a what-you-may-call-it! Why not chalk 'em up? I don't know. One of those things... Difficult to explain. You know what I mean, George. Any sign of her, sir? Afraid not, cox'n. How long will she be staying down, sir? She's got a week's leave. I expect she decided not to brave the night train. What, and miss a whole day? If I know Mrs. Randall, she'll be there all right, sir. How right you are! Full ahead, cox'n! There you are. Home for one week. The first we've had. Who do we have to thank for it? A chap called Ferguson. He's a shore job since he was knocked about at Dunkirk. He's living in mess while we've got it. Open up. Oh, but it's fun! Come and see. Are you sure there's no one here? I feel as if we were doing something wrong. - Why? We're married, aren't we? - I didn't mean that, idiot! I meant walking into someone else's house. - Do you know your way around? - No. Let's look. Kitchen. Bathroom. Coal-hole. Bill? Bill! Hello! You can get round. It's got everything. It's a real house. Better than last time. That terrible hotel! Remember? Yes. What's the matter? All this... - Don't you like it? - Yes, I love it but... What? You're going to laugh at me if I tell you. What are you talking about? You. When we were married, we had three days together. On your last leave, we stayed in a hotel. But this... Well, this is a home. It sounds sentimental, but it means more than it sounds. - Helen! - A lot more. - And it's a problem. - Helen! For one thing... I can't cook very well. I'll learn if you give me time. Cheer up! I can't cook either. Oh, can't you? I rather hoped you could a bit. We'll manage... Really, we will. But it's terribly important. Eating? - Yes, but... - I mean... You can't live on eggs and bacon! They'd do for a start. You do see what I mean about me, don't you? There's nothing in the house and the shops are miles away. I was going to ask you to stop the car and buy something, but I forgot. When I saw you again... I forgot. When you saw me again? You put it out of my head. Everything. Except that I was seeing you again. It's a very nice thing to have said. What? That I make you forget everything. Even breakfast. Why did you marry me, Bill? - What? - Seriously, why? Seriously? Because I'm in love with you. I remember... - Go on. - I remember the first time I saw you. I thought, "she's looking a bit lost, that girl. I better marry her." Shut up! Anyway, you're good for me. You make me laugh, for one thing. And for another? Well... Since I've known you, there seemed to be... I don't know... sort of purpose in things, I suppose... even in this damned war. You are going to be alright, aren't you? Of course. Helen! Nothing! It's nothing. I just thought that... without you... I thought... I just want this war to be over, that's all. Helen. I'm sorry! When do you go out again? Tonight. Anything special? Routine. Don't ever do anything silly with that ship of yours, will you? Promise! I've already promised the Admiralty. Promise me. Alright. When do you sail tonight? Sundown. Look, it's still up there. Stay there. Please. B Gun! Fire, fire, fire! We've got him! Check, check, check! Turn and beat it, cox'n. Hard a' starboard. Hard a' starboard, sir! - Alright, boys? - Yes. - Warm enough? - Yup. What's on your mind? It's only a little thing. We all know that, but what's on it? What I want to know is what happens if the Skipper's luck gives out? Well, it's every man for himself. That's what I thought. "I'm alright, Jack. You make your own arrangements." Looks as if we're first home. Action Stations! - Round 90 degrees, then zig-zag. - Aye aye, sir! B Gun, Red 100! Fire, fire, fire! Check, check, check! - Back on course, quick as you can. - Aye aye, sir! Lucky windfall, sir! Another one for the scoreboard! We can't claim that. He was still flying for home, happy as a lark. A lark with a pretty sore tail! He was going down slowly. We can't call it a confirmed kill. The Air Ministry rely on our reports. Look, sir, we did hit him, and it was going down! We want to keep our records straight just as much as any chairborne clot in the Air Ministry. We're missing a good chance! A good chance of what? Call it damage. - That's it, 'swain. - Aye aye, sir. - Take over, Number One, will you? - Aye aye, sir. Okay, wrap her up, boys! D'you think you got him? Could be. What's the damage? Shot us up, good and proper. No casualties, though. Dropped his bombs on the recreation ground, silly clot. Hope he didn't upset the Fish Market. I promised Helen I'd buy some mackerel for breakfast. Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen! Helen. After that... there was only the ship. Through her, I could hit back. There seemed nothing else in life... Only the ship. It wasn't long before we too were parted. One day, in the spring of 1945, we took her to her last anchorage. Well, here we are. Everybody aboard, cox'n? Everything out, sir. Ship's company all present and correct, sir. Thank you, Number One. And so we left her. The men went home. And I... Well, this place was for sale. I bought it. The idea was to build it up from nothing. Then, get contracts for building boats... and build them. That was the idea. Thanks for your letter. - Sit down. - Thank you. See we're not disturbed. - Smoke, if you want to. - No thank you, sir. I was sorry to hear about this boat-building venture of yours. - Folded up, has it? - Yes. In your letter, you ask for your old job back. It's no longer vacant. - Thank you. - Wait a minute. You wanted the truth without frills. Yes. I'm sorry. You knew your job was waiting for you at the end of the war. You didn't come back to it, and I understand why. Do you? You see, I was in the same position in 1918. I could have gone back to being a clerk. Instead, I started this firm. I succeeded first go. You must try again. Oh, I know it's easy enough to say. It's a question of... choosing your line. I find all the action I want in here, sitting behind this desk. But you... I'd say you'd need to be out and about with something... How shall I put it? Something living beneath your hands. You don't want to come back here, do you? Well, er... No, I don't. You'll be alright. You're on your own. Nobody but yourself to look after. I'm sorry. That's alright, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you very much, sir. ♪ Oh, he loves to travel far ♪ ♪ Every inch a sailor ♪ ♪ And you know what sailors are ♪ ♪ Rolling 'round the ocean ♪ ♪ Putting out to sea ♪ ♪ But he says one day, he'll be back again to stay... ♪ I don't know.

Let's see, what was she? - Ten Eighty-Seven. - Of course. I used to envy you that boat. Funny how each one was different. The one I had wallowed like an old walrus. If I'd had your turn of speed, I'd have got the U-boat off Walcheren. What was she called again? Ten Eighty-Seven. Yes. She was a special honey. - Well, good night, old man. - You going already? - Yes, I... - Are you a member? My dear fellow, of course I'm a member! - Bill! - George! Bill, you old devil! How are you? George, how nice to see you! The old firm, eh? This calls for a celebration! What'll you have? You will excuse us, won't you? Seeing as it's you, chum, a large pink gin. A large pink gin, I'll have a light. - Cigarette? - Er, no thanks. You look very prosperous. What are you doing? This and that. Got to scrape a living where you can nowadays, with all these ruddy restrictions. - I suppose so. - No, here, let me. - Expenses. - Thank you very much. Thanks. You look a bit glum.

Not really. Just what they call unsettled, I suppose. Tell you what, I've got an idea for a side line. - Needs someone like you. - Well? It would take a boat. A first-class boat and someone to run it. You and me. A fast motor-boat to make trips across the Channel and back. We've made enough of those in our time. What sort of trips? Passengers? Freight? Mm... well, you could call it that. Fast freight. I suppose you mean smuggling. Well, not to put too fine a point on it... yes. Nothing very serious, just a few things to lighten up the post-war darkness a bit. Er, nylons, a spot of wine and brandy, perhaps. It'd be more like the real thing again, instead of all this living in the past. The real thing? It's be fine to be back on the old ship. Ten Eighty-Seven? Yes, she's up for sale. I'm going to look her over. Care to come? Well, I... The trip is on me, old boy. No obligations, as they say. Yes, I'd like to. I'd like to see 1087 again. Then, here's to her, the old duck! There she is! It's her, alright. Remember the night Nobby Clarke got his? She's good! There's a lot to be done, but she's good. We'd be doing her a favour, getting her out of this graveyard. We must get her moved to where I can work on her. A change will do the old girl good. What's the betting she's ours? Birdie! - Mr. Randall, Skipper, sir! - Where have you sprung from? I work for a shipwrights in Plymouth. I've got some gear to deliver to a Mr. Hoskins. - Well, well! - I wondered when they said Hoskins. I just wondered. I thought, "Could that be Jimmy-the-one?" I never expected to see you, sir! - It is our Mr. Hoskins, is it? - Yes, Birdie, it's our Mr. Hoskins. We're going into the freight business. Oh, the old firm, eh? Randall and Hoskins. And this is the 1087. What've you done to her? Brought all the controls up top. There's only two of us to work her. It'll take more than two of you to run her. We'll manage. I tell you what, sir! Why don't you take me on? No, Birdie. But sir, I know the ship. The ship knows me! Good afternoon, Ship! There y'are, she winked back at me! I'm sorry, Birdie. That's okay, sir. Why not let me stay on until you finish getting her ready? Humans are like Number Nines, two always work faster than one. No, Birdie. Oh, come on, sir! I know her! Alright, then. Just till she's fitted out. - You'll never regret it, sir. - It's a bet! You wouldn't know the old girl. Marvellous, what a facial will do! Yes, sir! All she needs now is a real tiddly sailor. I know the very man for the job. See to it, cox'n. Thank you, sir. George. I don't think we should... Bill, he needs the job and we need him. That's all there is to it. Next week, we start work, Birdie. Aye aye, sir. Oh, Bill, by the way... This bumph. Put your name on it, will you? What are they? Details of ownership. Ten Eighty-Seven's always been yours. I wouldn't want to break it up. What shall we be carrying? What do people want most? Whatever it is, we'll give it to 'em. The old firm, eh? Hoskins and Randall. Put like that, our operations were practically a moral crusade. Our only aim in life was to make people happy. Hoskins did the fixing, I sailed the boat. It was wonderful to feel her bucking under my feet, and to be at sea again. We made a lot of trips, and a lot of money very fast. In fact, we got a bit over-confident, returning home literally crammed with stuff. Ten Eighty-Seven had red wine practically running out of her ears. There we are, gents. A nice hot cup of cocoa, compliments of the management. Thanks, Birdie. All other drinks are quite inferior, For warming up a cold posterior, Drink it down and soon you'll find... A lovely, rosy glow behind. Always reminds me of the creeks along the Dutch coast. Yes, that night up the Scheldt when Jerry was waiting for us. Motor-boat, ahoy! Stop your engines! This looks official. Stop your engines! We're coming aboard! Open up a bottle, Bill. We appear to be entertaining. Now, don't give the game away that you're new to this job. No one respects a learner. Just keep an open mind and your mouth shut. - What do you want? - Customs. - Where are you from? - Falmouth. Late getting in, aren't you? Engine trouble. The wrong 'uns always say that, you can never contradict them. Why no navigation lights? They fused. Some blame the generator. Let's get this sorted out in comfort, shall we? Come on down to the cabin. We shall now be offered a light refreshment to keep off the night air. Don't touch it. Come on in. Very nice. Yes, she's a trim little craft. Get the glasses out, Bill, there's a good chap. It isn't often we have guests at this hour of the morning. You sure you won't join us? I'd like to. - You will? Oh, good, I thought... - I told him not to touch it. - I didn't say anything about me. - Good fellow. You sure you won't? Quite sure! - Brought in? - Right, yes. Haven't paid duty yet either. You going to charge me on it? Maybe. Let us into the secret. I was remembering when I was last aboard one of these MGBs. During the war? Aye. She saved my life, that one did. How? Well, I was on patrol up in the North Sea. Nineteen forty-one, it'd be... We had a bit of a difference with a Jerry sub. I was in the water, counting the stars, for nigh on seven hours. Just when I thought I'd have a chance of taking a closer look at them... one of these came up. They put me on the seat here, I remember, and pumped about 20 gallons of water out of me. Aye, they were good lads in the MGBs. Oh, thank you very much! What do you mean, "thank you"? Meet a couple of them. Were you in them? Well, I don't know! Well, that's all over now. We've no time for reminiscing. Go and have a look round. I'll show you. Besides what he shows you, have a look on your own account. Use your initiative. And don't forget the usual offices. I've known cisterns to be used for some very funny things in my time. Yes... Have some more brandy. No, thanks. I only had the first tot just to see what you had aboard. Cunning, eh? Common sense. Can you tell if people are up to no good? I mean, before you find the stuff. - Usually. - How? By looking at them. Shifty, eh? No, they put it on, you know. Like you. La-di-da. That's hot. The other's cold. Alright? Anything else? He'll be back in a minute. What's he doing? Using his initiative. Give me another drink. Was everything alright? You can consider yourselves off duty and have a real drink. I think I'll take a look myself. I'll take you 'round. No, thanks. I'll go by myself. You stay here. What's up here? You're full of water! What? Get the pumps going, Birdie! She's not holed, as far as I can see. I wonder if it's that darned valve in the lavatory. That's it. It's been left open. You have to close the valve after you use it, or it floods in. It's below the water line. For pity's sake! I told you to search the ship, not sink it! I'm terribly sorry about all this. It's quite alright. We'll doss in the chart-house and clean up in the morning. It's not often I'm given to embarrassment, but... Well, I must say... Come on! Whatever happened to that automatic valve? Well, it was automatic, and it is now, but just for a short time it... kind of got stuck. Well done, that man! I couldn't have done it better myself! After that, we were a bit more careful, and covered our activities with a more legitimate business. A round trip, four hours at three bob a head! Come on, don't stand around! You, sir! Why not come along? Three bob a head, no charge for the kiddies! Anything from a day return to Boulogne, to trips round the harbour. Pleasure trips by day and business by night didn't allow much time for sleep. But we revelled in it... Hoskins, Birdie, and I... and 1087. Keep her as she is. I'm going to have forty winks. Aye aye, sir. Coastguard cutter Orion. Heave to, we wish to board you. Heave to! - Full ahead all! - Don't be a fool. Hold it, Birdie. Full ahead, I said! We'll never get away with it, George. Let's bluff 'em. If that fails, we'll get rid of the stuff overboard. - Heave to, we wish to board you! - I'll start unlashing, just in case. Slow all. What's your business? Pleasure cruise! Why have you no navigation lights? The fuse has blown! We're boarding you. - What the... - You in charge here? Yeah. Who the devil are you? Not rummagers, that's one thing you can be thankful for. You amateurs are spoiling the market. Pirates! In civvies! We'll take this load of you. Come on. I'll give you ten seconds to clear off my ship. You and who else? Me, big head! Alright, come back aboard! Come back aboard! Come back aboard! Try high-jacking us again and we'll blow the lot of you out of the sea! Nice work, chaps! Work? Blimey, that was only play! Where did you get that gun? Ah, it's a memento from the good old days. In this game, we are professionals. - Okay, cox'n, wind her up. - Aye aye, sir. We'll have to start a new scoreboard. What should I chalk up? - Nothing this time, I wasn't trying. - Ah, you get it easy. We better get you something bigger. How about a six-pounder up forrard? Yeah, I'll have it for my birthday! Did you, um... Did you notice anybody on that other boat, on the bridge? No. Why? Oh, I just wondered. Not the sort of face you'd... want to fall in love with at first sight, but interesting. Worth a little investigation. If I wanted to buy this, would you be the one to sell it? No, sir. It would be the Major. The Major, I see. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning. It's a nice job. Yes. Yes, I meant the car. That's what I thought you meant. How many knots will she do? Oh, a seafaring man, I gather. Well, we're both in the same boat, as they say. Look, are you after a car, or what? Do you mean you sell those things as well? In that case, we might come to a deal. I'm always open to an offer. By the way... my name is Fordyce. Major. No need to tell me your rank. I'm not one of your customers. What the devil do you mean? That was my rank. Alright, alright. I'm Hoskins. Lieutenant. Aha! The Centre of operations, I suppose. My office. How did you come to get in this business, Major? What business? Whatever business you had in mid-channel with... What was it? A bren? As a matter of fact, old boy, it was a 38. - Want some of this? - Love some. I found things had changed a bit when I got out of the army. Had to live, of course. Got tired of working for the plebs after fighting for them. Perhaps you were fighting on the wrong side. Not so far from the truth as you think. - Say when. - When. So, you struck out on your own? In a small way. Gives me an active life. My sort's always supposed to end up at a seaside boarding house, taking tea with old ladies. Never attracted me, I'm afraid. So, you're your own boss? - Absolutely. - Anything I want, I come to you. That's right. By the way, old boy, I'm not of an inquisitive nature, but... how did you find me? Your cover's not as good as you seem to think. Oh, thank you. Well, tell me how you found me. One day... when we're old friends who've worked together and can trust each other. And you can make that as soon as you like. So, you want to come in with me? Come off it, Fordyce! Why should I want to come in with you? You're nothing. But the organisation that employs you... that's different. I like the sound of it. So, let me in, Fordyce, or I tell your boss how you're bungling things at this end. Are you trying to scare me? I'm not trying, Fordyce. I'm succeeding. Want some more? Tell me all! After that fracas in mid-channel, I got to know your face. And then, last week, I went to London on the same train as you. Funny, isn't it? Most amusing. One thing led to another. You, for instance, led to the set-up. So, you're your own boss. What do you call that little man who orders you about from London? As a matter of fact, I call him Charlie. He's no gentleman, is he, Fordyce? Unfortunately... no! Alright, Hoskins, you know it all. What do you want? You've got a good job. Let me help you keep it. I'll see what I can do. Good. It'll be a 50-50 split on everything. - What do you... - And no questions. Ever. What's that for? Gentleman's agreement, old boy. Don't be silly. ♪ It's a lovely day today 'cause everybody's happy... ♪ That's a terrible noise, Birdie. What's wrong? I'm just happy in my work, sir. Those days weren't so bad either. I wonder if she's happy in her new job. I wonder. Children, never say I don't look after you. While you do the housework, Uncle George works his fingers to the bone. - You're pleased with yourself. - The firm is branching out. What's called in more respectable circles a merger. Well, let's hear about it. That's all there is to it. Ran into a chap who can give us work, no questions on either side, and a 50-50 split. What kind of work? The idea is we should smuggle in loads of lollipops and crates of lemonade and coke for the kiddies, bless 'em. Very funny, George. Now, let's have it. Why not leave this side of things to me? Listen, George, you keep a lot to yourself lately. Don't forget I'm in this with you, and Birdie. I'll deal with the sordid details. They're right up my street. You're happy with the ship, I leave her to you. Okay, so I'm responsible for 1087. I better know what she's expected to do. For Pete's sake! Does the ship have a say in the jobs we take on? She won't ask any questions, certainly. Like the ideal woman, eh? She does what you want, when you want it. If we knew the way and could set a course for hell... she'd go. I hope you're satisfied. - And your friends too. - I think so. Good. We'll meet again soon, won't we? - See you soon. - See you. - Take her away, Birdie. - Aye aye, sir. They're good, aren't they? They look real, if that's what you mean. Jerry printed millions of quids' worth. Could have gummed up the works badly, if they'd been circulated during the war. Lucky they never got around to it. So now, we're doing the job for them. Don't be a clot, old boy. All of it that matters was rounded up long ago. This little lot just got overlooked, that's all. Our idea was running in a few luxuries people are short of. There are plenty of people short of this, old boy. You ought to know that. This job stinks and you know it! Go and see to those engines. Both wings have packed up, sir. The inner's choking like nobody's business. Did you check her over? Only this morning, she was a clean as a whistle. I've never know her do this before. Get the engines started. I'd put you on a charge if we were in the Service. Lots would be different if we were in the Service. Every one of these plugs is clogged with oil. Are you sure you serviced them? Only this morning, sir. I... I can't understand it. Get them cleaned off, then. I hope she won't start playing us up. She hadn't better! From now on, she's got to be on the top line. And one other thing, Bill! What we carry is my business. The ship's yours. Let's get her cracking. Business conference below, I suppose. - What's the job to be this time? - I don't know. You don't ask anymore, do you? No. - Just get on with it. - That's right. And hope for the best? For heaven's sake, shut up! Yes, I can get inshore at high tide, and there's good cover where the trees come down. I shan't want to hang about. It's the biggest job you've done, so you'll have... What's the matter? You look terrible! I'm not really used to the sea. I say! You're not going to be sick, are you? Look, before you pass out, you better give me the dope. What's the cargo? Alright then, just tell me the size. Oh, about your size. - Human, eh? - Hm. Alive? Just. Here, drink this. My dear chap, you're bright green. Very fetching. Oh, one other thing. How much is the, er... Five hundred. Very nice! It really is a big job, then. Are you going to tell me who he is? I don't know. I... - Cox'n! - Sir? Help this gentleman to the side, will you? - Yes, sir. - Don't drop him. What's the matter, sir? You feeling poorly? Oh, yes, you are! - We've got to get away. - I know. The tide'll catch us. They said he'd be here on time, no waiting about. Five hundred quid! Oh, well... Wait here! Come on out. I'm waiting. Okay, okay, why keep us waiting? Yes, you have! Do you want to be taken off or not? You must've seen us. Why not signal? Leave us standing there like fools. Oh, come on, come on! Just dumped you, did they? Well, let's get going. - Can we make it? - Just, I think. Take it away, cox'n! You see that? - The car? - Yes. I said, take it away, cox'n! Something big. Three engines, I'd say. Get an alert to all coastal launches. Get the French on it too! Fair gives me the willies, he does. For two hours, he's just stood there. Not a word to anybody. It's the port outer again. See what you can do. Aye aye. Must be near the mouth of the estuary. Can't be more than a mile off shore. Better make west of Honfleur. It's too busy this side. Right. I wonder who the devil he is. Let's just say 500 quid and leave it at that, huh? Patrol ship! Will you stop? Motor boat to port. Patrol ship here! Will you please heave to? Motor boat ahoy! Please stop! - Full ahead! - Motor boat ahoy! Will you please heave to? Can't you hear me? Stop immediately! Hard a' port, they're crossing us! She's heavy on the helm again. What the devil's the matter with her? I wonder. Motor boat ahoy! Please stop! Can't you hear me? Stop immediately! That's dodged them. Thank heaven for this fog. Get below and see to those engines. They're dying on us, sir! I reckon she just don't want to know. What the devil do you mean? She's losing heart. That's what he means. Don't talk like a fool. Motor boat ahoy! If we work quietly, they'll never find us in this fog. What the devil is he up to? Our friend decided to swim for it. Good luck to him. Make your position known! Patrol ship. Make your position known! What are you doing? Why not? What have we got to hide? Hello? Hello, you can come alongside now! Sorry for the delay, our hooter was up the spout! George... I want to get out. Get out? The jobs have been getting worse. Ever since the tie-up with Fordyce. Scared? No. But last night... that man! Pretty nasty. But then, we get paid for things like that. You take the money, don't you? - I have. - Meaning? I've taken the last. Just like that! You take it for the easy stuff, but when we reach further into the drain, you're afraid of getting your morality wet. Listen... This sort of talk isn't going to help, George. I'm not scared and I'm not squeamish. But there are some things I'll not do. I always thought I'd have to face this situation with you, sooner or later. You had this sort of... softness back in the war. I thought your down-and-out days might have cured you. Seems they haven't. Lucky I invested in a little security. Security? The ship and everything to do with her. She's in your name. You signed for her, nothing to do with me. She's all yours, Bill. Your baby. You're holding her, not me. Come on, old boy. We've got a good firm, Hoskins and Randall. Why break it up? We must stick together. I can't do a damned thing without the ship, and you don't want to go back to that tramp's life, do you? Brooding about how happy you might've been with... What's her name, Helen? Bet... Better now? You needed that, didn't you? You can't say I'm not a good friend, when I allow myself to be knocked about just so you can... relieve your feelings. That is all we have to go on, gentlemen. Not very much, I'm afraid. A powerful boat, and men ruthless enough to do a job like this. Are they likely to put up a fight? If they understand the penalty for what they've been doing, I should say, yes, they'll fight. Any more questions? Can we ask for help if we get near them? - Well... - Call on the Navy, within reason. But don't bring out the Fleet. Good old Fred! A signal has gone out to all ships in the area to report their position and course during the last 24 hours. That information will be available to you. Don't flood us with reports of things you think merely suspicious. I want you to be sure, then act. Thank you, gentlemen. Coming, Sam? Aye. - Think we'll find them? - Aye. Soon? - Aye. - How? By looking. Clever. It's unlikely they're hiding in there. Maybe. Automatic valve! First time I got my feet wet in the Service. That's it! La-di-da! What on earth are you talking about? Merely a suspicion, sir. Sorry. Sir! I've been waiting for you, sir. - What is it, Birdie? - Did you know, sir? - Did you know who he was? - You mean, last night? No, Birdie, I don't know who he was. Oh, I knew you couldn't have, sir. - Hoskins aboard? - Yes, sir. - Pack your things and wait for me. - Aye aye, sir. I've seen it. And we were helping him to get away. But we didn't know who he was! So, that's our excuse, it is? It won't do, George. Not this time. You said the jobs were getting worse. You're right. Last night was too much. We'll get out. Do you really believe that we can get out now? Finish? Clean off the muck and forget what we've done? Do you really believe that? - Why not? - Because it's happened! We did those things. From the smuggling of a few bottles of wine in the early days... to the carrying of that raving maniac last night. We did it all, George! And we can't wipe that off the scoreboard. I believe you knew what that man Raines had done before we took him aboard. You knew! Not true. I don't believe you, George. Pity! Because you're going to have to put up with me for a bit longer. I meant what I said about getting out. Portugal's nice, I believe. It'll need both of us to make a trip like that, though. If you want to part company when we get there... well, alright. When we get there. No. I see. Of course, there's Birdie's part in all this. In other words... either I help you get away... or you turn Birdie in. That's right. If we leave him, how do you know he won't go to the police? When you're with me? Don't be silly! If I were alone, it'd be a different matter. He hates me. But he has a... Well, let's say he's attached to you. Alright. I'll tell Birdie he can go. And you? I'll sail with you tonight. Oh, Bill! Look, about tonight. I want you at the Creek. Makes for a simpler getaway. And, and Bill... I didn't know about that man... what he'd done. Honestly. Ah! All ready, sir. I'm not leaving, Birdie. You're what, sir? I've changed my mind. You... You can't mean that, sir! I'm in this pretty deep, you know, Birdie. He's putting the screws on, is he? Oh, well, sir! I reckon it's better to keep it two against one. I'll stay as long as you have to. Don't waste your sympathy on me, cox'n. I'm getting good money out of this racket. If you want to get out, you're a free agent. What I do is my own business. You fool, making that racket! Would anything less have made you open up? The place is being watched. All the more reason to get out. When we've finished our business. - What business? - The money for that! - Where is it? - My dear old boy! It was cash on delivery. - You made a mess of the job. - Shut up! Have you been paid? You think I'd be creeping around if I had a fiver on me? Listen, Fordyce. I'm getting out tonight, all fixed. Only one thing keeping me. My cut on last night! Can we make it? Who said anything about you? My dear old boy, I took it for granted. No go, then? Pay your passage. In cash. Listen, Hoskins... In words of one syllable, there is no cash. Get it? I don't believe you. Hello, up there! Anyone at home? You want something? That's right. I want you. Remember me, do you? Yes. You're the talkative one. The smart one. Got a new partner, I see. Won't you introduce me? My name's Brewster. Customs. There's been a bit of trouble. Anything to do with us? Well, when it first came up, you know, I thought of you. Oh, why? Oh, I can't tell, really. I remembered you were in things in a small way. I thought you might have got on a bit. Have you? Struck me at the time. One day, these lads will take on something too big. More than they can chew, maybe. Seen the papers? - What is this, an arrest? - No, not yet. I had my suspicions. But until I'd seen you again, I'd not be knowing if you were up to a job of this... dirty sort. Well, now you've seen me again. That's right. How do you like it? I'm not suspicious anymore. - Good. - I'm bloody certain. I'll have a look at your mate. Turn around, you. Don't be shy! That's a silly thing to play with. Put it away, you fool! He's going to run us in. That's right. So, we're going to kill him. To give us a chance. To give us a chance, you see. You never want to do a lot of talking with one of these things in your hand. You alright, Hoskins? Yes. Good fellow. Thought you might want to argue about it. Inclined to underestimate you. I think he was alone, but we'd better wait a minute or two. A shot'll bring 'em, if they're coming. Can't we get going? In a moment. Now you'll have to take me on your ship, won't you? Is that why you did it? I'm getting too old and too tired to be caught at this job. Afraid I took the decision on myself, for you, I mean. Or perhaps, you'd rather spend the rest of your life shut up than try to get away with it. The old fool! Ah, these men of duty. Come on, Hoskins. Let's go. Keep off. I know you. You're one of them. Little cox'n. No good being sorry now. Who was it? Your boss. And a new chap. "La-di-da", he said. "La-di-da", then he fired. I'll get some help. There's no help you can get. You've seen men die before. But you can get him. Get him, the dirty, little, crawling, killing gent! Look, don't, don't talk! Do you know, cox'n, it's funny. Until I saw your boss... how he looked... it was only a suspicion. What? What are you doing? I told to get away. In town, they shot that customs man. - Hoskins shot him? - Either him or the Major. What are you doing here, Birdie? I ran into a friend of mine. Somebody had done him a bad turn. They left him in a garage. I'm sorry to hear it. George! You said Birdie could get out, remember? - Go on, run for it! - Don't be damned silly. Can't break up the party now. Let's get aboard. Alright, alright. I know that thing works. Then, go ahead! You'll never get away with this. Let's try, shall we? I'll get the pumps going! Check the engines! You'd better come up. Let me have a spell down here. Why are you tampering with the engines? Don't be a fool! We're trying to keep 'em going! - I don't believe you! - Oh, have a heart, mate! I've been down here for hours saying kind words to her. - Come out, both of you! - You're mad! If we leave them now, they'll die on us! You're lying! You're trying to wreck the ship. Come on! - Alright, alright. - Birdie, stay where you are! Bad? Fair to middling. I'm turning back. No, no, sir. You can't do that. They'll pin everything onto you. You've got to try to get away with it. Sir, don't turn back for me, please. It's not only for you, Birdie. It's for me too. It's the only way now, you know? Very good, sir? Very good, sir. We're turning back! Don't be a fool, we'll make it! We've been out in worse than this. We're turning back. Birdie's been shot. To hell with Birdie! We're going on, I say! Bill! Bill! Come on, my old darling. You can do it. Birdie loves you. I'm going to get you up top. I'll be alright. Don't argue. I want you up on the bridge with me. Very good, sir. She won't do it. Not after what we've made her do. Not after that. She's got her pride, like all of us. She won't do it. You can't blame her. No, Birdie, I don't blame her. We'll take it easy. Aye aye, sir. I remember... I remember she said... Helen said... One day... the day before she... She was joking, you know? Made fun of me a lot. She said... "Don't ever do anything silly with that ship of yours, will you?" Well, Birdie... we did do something... silly... useless... futile... and pathetic! And so, she died. She gave up and died, in anger... and in shame. Yes, she had her pride.
