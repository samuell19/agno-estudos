Ripped, slightly corrected and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Come, everyone! Gather around, my friends! Witness amazing skills never seen before in the good city of Jadur! Ladies and gentlemen, see before you the masters of the mysteries of the sand. Use your charm, not exclusive to you, on the brokenhearted ladies. Give them in generously. Here is Ayyub, master of the devil wheel. Over here, we have Abdulla, the blade. Behind us, we have Ajib. Chetti, leave them alone. Ali with the dragon tongue. The tower of a lot! One, two, three, four, five... Quickly now! Quickly! Six, seven. It must be tonight. All right. We have everything we need. Swords, the Rose. This is madness. We will never defeat the curfew patrol. Asaf, it is our freedom we are fighting for. We will die if needs be. - He's right. - Silence. Water! Water! Water! Water! Water, master. I'm dying. Debt is free. Water costs money. Charity is the key to paradise. You are the kindest of all, my master. You think so? Cockroach. Well done, Khasim. In the gutter where he belongs. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right, go now. Watch your back. When the curfew sounds, we'll be ready. The curfew patrol is ready, master. Lord Alquazar. Caliph of Jadur. King of all men. Wait till you're asked, scum! Bahloul, you are my iron fist, but Khasim acts as my eyes and ears in the city of Jadur. Let the toad speak. Lord Alquazar, Caliph of Jadur. King of all men. Master of the universe... News. Not flattery and a slimy tongue. Do you have information? Emperor of the universe... We know the ring leaders who plot against you. The carpet seller and the brass worker, they've already laid their plans. When darkness falls, they will ambush the curfew patrol, they will attack the palace, and they will fail. You are not my only source of information, Khasim. Let me deal with them, Caliph. Not yet. They will learn the true power of Alquazar. You will hold your men back until I give the word. Then... - My lord, Caliph. - Zuleira. You shan't escape me. You're my prisoner now. I have work to do, Zuleira. Numbers, books, the stars. They take you from me. I'm so alone. All I ask is an hour of your company. That is impossible. Not now. Why do you lock yourself away? Why can't I be there in your study? You are never to enter that room. It contains secrets, experiments. Disturb them and you would be in such danger that not even I could help you. - I do not... - Enough! Trust me and obey me. Bahloul. Alquazar. Princess need never be lonely. Even in Jadur. Mirror of the moon... Show me Jadur and the traitors who scurry there like rats. Quickly. Into position. Go. I need more, Mamhoud. Quickly now. Get off the streets, old man. Go to your room, boy. Quickly, before the curfew sounds. More rope. Quickly. The tide is amongst them, Chetti. But why are they afraid? Hurry. Get in. The curfew patrol. Close the gates. Let us all in. Hurry. The soldiers are coming! My loyal subjects. Fools! Let them be dust before the wind. Why hasn't the patrol marched through? They always come now. Now, Bahloul. You know the law of Alquazar. Anyone breaking the curfew is a condemned man. If they resist... kill them. Chetti, look. He's still breathing. He needs water. Now am I not the mightiest of all? Not yet the mightiest. You dare to challenge me? Your master? I offer no challenge. Only the truth. Until you possess the Rose of Elil, you cannot be supreme. Is the talisman safe? It remains untouched. The greatest talisman for good that exists. Your evil hand can never pluck the flower of mercy without help. Then it can be taken! What price must I pay? A bargain must be struck between us. Does a master bargain with his slave? Give me my freedom. Not till I have the Rose! Do you wish to remain in an eternity of darkness? Choose! Once it is brought to you, will you release me then? You have my word. The hand that can bring the Rose to you is already here in Jadur. A stranger. See? What kind of a city is this? No place for strangers, master. Terrible things happen here. Hide yourself. Quickly. I can't leave you, master. You're hurt. Don't argue. Hide yourself. Chetti, this place is beyond my understanding. Come on! Come on! I'm a prince of a son of a prince! Release me! We'll let you out in the morning. Don't worry. In time for your execution. Listen to me! Tell your master who I am! Save your breath for prayer, my son. Allah helps those who help themselves. He doesn't seem to have done you much good, does he? You're not from these parts. I'm Hasan. Son of Abdul Albukir. Prince of royal blood. Oh, yes. We don't have many princes visiting Jadur. I speak the truth and come here in good faith. I am Wazir al Wuzara, head man of this city once, and I give you greeting. A political prisoner? There was a time when Jadur was a city fit for honest men. Now it is filled with shadows and ruled by fear. It also holds the most beautiful Princess in the land... Zuleira. Few men have seen her face and lived. It is said that Alquazar poisoned Zuleira's father, the rightful Caliph of Jadur, in order to marry her mother, a woman of incomparable loveliness. She, too, died. Now warriors sworn to defend the Princess to the death guard her night and day. She has never set foot outside the palace. Not even for a single hour of her exquisite life. But her beauty won't worry you much longer. There must be a way out. Young. Brave. And now, I will put him to the test and help him to answer his own questions. Mealtime, old man. Oh, nothing for you, old prince of princes. No point in wasting good food... Hey! Guards! Guards! After him! Bahloul! You are an intruder, prince Hasan. But a courageous one. He's wounded. Then he must be cared for. That is what you would wish, is it not, my child? Bring food and wine and a dressing for his wound. Your dungeons are less hospitable, Caliph. You have proved that you are worthy of better things. We will talk later, but now you will need to rest and be refreshed. The Princess Zuleira will see that you are taken care of. Khasim. I have work for you. Pick these up and put others there. May Allah bless that storm, Abdulla. We'll not need to steal food now for days. Hey, my brothers, the cockroach. A scrap for your pale brother. Go back to your gutter, cockroach! Ah, beat it! And take your brother with you! My friends, watch. A lesson in kindness. This way, my queen of the gutter. Let Achmed guide your sightless steps for you. Trust me. Animals. Pigs. Sons of dogs. It wasn't her fault, master. Ah, we all know Achmed's sense of humor. You lose. Peaches, Achmed. Here. You've earned your breakfast. Why, thank you, master. Good-bye, little cockroach! A banquet, Chetti. And we deserve it. Where is the boy Majeed? I am here, old woman. Give to the afflicted and you shall be forever blessed. Old woman, I have nothing to give. Only this peach. It's yours. At last. What are you doing? That was our breakfast! Whatever is inside the peach, give it to me. Is it there? The stone? It's a jewel. The sapphire of Al Addin. Give it to me! I have waited a thousand years, and now I am free. My name is Vahishta. Chetti, there's something inside the jewel. Majeed, this sapphire, one set in the magic ring of Al Addin, is forever in your service. Are you the jinnee of the ring? I was. A thousand years ago. A jinnee Princess! But I am not your slave. But I would willingly be yours. You've served me well enough by freeing me from evil. In return, I give you my protection. What have I done to need protection? I speak of the future. Three times your life will be in danger, and three times I can save you. What must I do? Call my name. Help will come. But three times only. It's hunger that makes me see visions, Chetti. There's no beggar woman, there's no jewel. It's real! once we sell this jewel, Chetti, we'll eat like kings for a lifetime. Come on. Many others before you have asked for the hand of the Princess Zuleira in marriage. But none have come this far. You are brave, you are honest, and you are worthy of my kingdom. You honor me greatly, Caliph, but I've no need of your riches or kingdom. Zuleira is my only desire. You have not won her yet, prince Hasan. Yeah, you have proved yourself with honor, but there is one test to come. Then tell me what I must do, Caliph. An expedition into the unknown, a journey fraught with danger. Your very life may be at risk. I offer it willingly. As Zuleira's champion? Yes. For her, I'd achieve the impossible. Then bring me the Rose of Elil. Only the bravest of princes would attempt such a task. I will bring it to you. I, too, can be generous. Return safely with the talisman and the Princess Zuleira is your bride. I accept... if you'll take me. With all my heart. So be it. My blessings on your safe return. But one sword will not be enough. You will need a bodyguard, handpicked for his strength and for his loyalty. Khasim. The safety of prince Hasan will be in your care. Serve him well. Gentlemen, the next item for sale is this beautiful amethyst stone set in a magnificent gold setting by the finest craftsmen. What am I bid? Get out of here, boy. You can talk about six, please. Six now. Six. Six and a half. Thank you, sir. That is getting nearer the price. - Seven. - Away. Away. This is no place for street urchins. Go beg in the market. I have a jewel! I have a jewel! A street urchin with a jewel? How did you come by it, boy? It was a gift. A reward. Perhaps I will recognize it. Show it to me. Look! Incredible. It is a gem worthy of a prince. I must examine it. What kind of a trick is this? The boy's a trained jeweler. That's very good to fool Omar the goldsmith. I'll give you a piece of sapphire! Little boy, what you'll get from me is a good beating! Did you see what he did? It's the best trick I've seen in years. What's the use of such a jewel, Chetti, when it can't be sold? Hello, boy. I would like a word with you, if you don't mind. Let go! What do you want? Who are you? Let me go! What do you want? I am Achmed. This is the mauve gang. We're a firm of brokers. We deal in lost property. Show us what you have. It was a gift. A reward. I bet its owner has a different tale to tell, huh? I don't steal! And I am the king of Egypt. Show it to me! how do I know I can trust you? I pay a fair price and I keep my mouth shut! On my mother's grave. - Hey! - The stone. Where is the sapphire? Don't try the switch game on me! There it is again. How could it be? Try to diddle Achmed, will you? I'll fix you! How do you want him fixed? Break his bones. Bruises? Strangling. Throat cut. Let's be generous, my friends. All of them. Get him! Come back! Come back, thief! Nab him! Don't let him get away! Is your determination still as strong, Hasan? I will never turn back, Caliph. Then it is best that you leave now while the stars are in your favor. Are we to be given no directions? Does the journey require horses or camels? None of those is necessary. Carpets need no commands. You've only to step upon it and it will carry you to the place that you seek. Come. Step upon the carpet. Hasan. Take care. Bahloul. Allah be with you, Hasan. Ugly fool, get out of my way! We have found ourselves a cockroach, my friends. Let's cut him into slack pieces and feed him to the dogs! Vahishta, save me! Where did you spring from? I told you strange things happen in Jadur. Hold on. There's no going back now. Even the eagles never fly so fast. Trouble ahead. Khasim. The boy. Let me give you a hand! Scram! Help! Master! We've lost the boy! Hasan! Majeed! Majeed! Majeed! Vahishtal save me! Majeed! No, no, master! This carpet has a mind of its own. Majeed! We've reached it, Khasim. The island of Elil. Let us move on, master. It's like a graveyard here. A sign. Could it be the Rose itself? That would be too easy. Let's find out. Master, wait! Master! Their progress is more cautious than a snail. Why are you here, child? Bahloul tells me that Hasan will never... He knows nothing. Then there is news of Hasan. Hasan is safe. I've seen him. He's reached Elil. But how could you know that? You expect too many answers. Be satisfied with what you have. Now leave me. It must open for me... if it opens for Alquazar. Zuleira. Do not be afraid. Step-father? What are you? I am the soul of Alquazar. His sacrifice to the evil ones. And I am bound to him by a spell that is stronger than death itself. Is there no escape? Once the Rose is brought to him, then will I be free. I wish to see Hasan. There is no time. You are in great danger here. Show me Hasan. A trick of the sun. An empty bottle's no use to us, Khasim. But it's still corked, master. And a full bottle is a blessing to a thirsty man. What sort of wine is that? Free! Free at last! Look, master. It's a jinnee. We set it free. It seems to be pleased. Yes, I am pleased. And so you should be, old smoky one! Freedom is rare and wonderful! Reward us! So, you expect a reward! We need help, jinnee. We have to find the Rose of Elil. Never in a thousand years! You have to defeat me first! What sort of gratitude is that? Give us what's due to us! Three wishes! Be silent, you speck of insignificance! Yes, I am grateful. For you have given me the chance to kill you. For that alone, I grant you one last favor. A swift and merciful death. We can't get past him, master. Let's go back. Why can't he pick on someone his own size? Let's bring him down to our level. He's made of smoke! We can't touch him! I'm off! Hasan! Smash the bottle. No! No! No. No. No. Have pity! No! No! No! No! Spare this poor servant of the wrongs. No! No, no! - No! - If you want mercy, answer me! Ask what you will. Your humble slave replies. You know what we seek. Go bravely... where there was once a heart of fire. I did not ask for riddle. Do not destroy me. Show mercy. The same mercy that you showed to us, smoke ball! Ah, he's solid enough now. Serves you right, smoke ball! That is where we must go, Khasim. To the volcano. Where once there was a heart of fire. Allah be praised. I know. We'll get Vahishta to help us. Chetti, come back! Chetti, come back! Come back! Chetti! Chetti! Please come back! Chetti! Chetti, come back! Chetti! Chetti. Chetti? The lock! The lock! I should know about the safety lock. I put it there myself. Yes, the safety lock. I forgot. Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! This is the demon's gullet. This must be his mouth. Be brave, Khasim. You can spare the flesh and blood anytime, master. But this is a demon from hell itself. Come back! Roar. Khasim, come back! Where are you going? Come back! My friends, they're safe! Khasim, come back! Hasan! Can you hear me! Hasan! Khasim! It knows us by name! We're doomed! Do not be afraid! It's me! Majeed! Majeed is not dead! Majeed is not dead? Hasan! We must be careful. It's a clever demon. Majeed is not dead? Majeed is not dead! Hasan! Khasim! Hasan? Khasim? That is no trick. Majeed lives. Let's get to him. That boy has enough lives to keep a cat happy. You! You are gonna pay for this! I did you no harm. You! You're an intruder! But we need the Rose of Elil. It's a matter of life and death. Ah, they all say that. Thieves. Sorcerers. Witches. It's not allowed! I'm not a magician or a thief. This is gonna hurt me more than it is you. It's good to see you again, Majeed. Where have you been? Must I do the work all by myself? How did you sur... How did you survive the storm, cockroach? It isn't important. This crooked one is the keeper of the Rose. Then we must question him. My master approaches. Go now while you can. I'm not afraid to meet him face-to-face. I'll demand to be told the truth. Defy him and he will kill you. Whatever his evil, he still loves me. Once he has the Rose, he will be all-powerful. Life and love will have no meaning for him. Go. Now. Zuleira. My h... my head. - Where is the Rose? - Yes, where is the Rose? - Rose? - Answer. Come on, answer. You want to find the Rose? It's across those pipes. Over there behind that door... If you care to look for it. Your entrance to the garden. Allow me, master. You think it's funny, do you, blacksmith? Let me try. The Rose! The Rose! We found it! Be careful. You have trespassed, and you shall be punished. By the Caliph of darkness, dealer in sorcery and lies. When I have the Rose, Zuleira, I will let you live. Chetti! Come, Chetti. It's Chetti. The boy still lives! Look. The sapphire's back. Sapphire. Chetti brought it. That's no problem. I'll do the work as usual. Majeed, come back. Don't worry. I'll be all right. He knows best. Come on, Chetti. Don't be frightened. The boy. It is the boy. Rose of Elil, I come to you with an open heart. Do not turn me away. Rose of Elil, forgive me, but our need is great. Well done, cockroach. The Rose of Elil. Khasim! Hasan! You killed him. That'll be no disappointment to Caliph Alquazar. It'll save him the expense of a wedding. How can you joke about Hasan's death? Have you no heart? An assassin has to have a sense of humor, sprat! What fun would life be otherwise? Carpet! Stay here and weep. I go to greet Khasim. Chetti, bring me the Rose! Go on! Wait! Wait! Carpet, back! Carpet, back! Back! I cannot return to Alquazar without the Rose! Back, carpet, back! Back, carpet, back! Back! Back, carpet, back! Back! Back, carpet, back! I have one more life to give. Vahishta. Help me to save Hasan. Why do you ask me to save the life of your friend, Majeed? You refuse me? My gift of life is for you alone. My friend is a brave man. Is he not a prince worth ten of me? Your love for him has won my help. But you have a stronger power than mine already in your hand. The Rose of Elil? What can it do? When Hasan awakes, ask the Rose to take you from this enchanted island. But first, touch the sapphire to his lips. You're my guardian angel, Vahishta. I obey. You live! Where's Khasim? He betrayed you, master. He tried to kill you. Then he went to his true master, Alquazar, on the magic carpet. Then we're trapped on this island forever. We have the Rose. How can that help? Take it in your hand. Close your eyes and trust me. Rose of Elil, in the name of all things good and true, take us back to Jadur. We dare not try it again. It will only mean certain death. Asaf, freedom is the only thing left worth dying for. Yes. Better a living camel than a dead tiger. We still have weapons. I say use them, while we still have the people behind us. - Yeah. - Yes. Spies! Kill them! Kill them! Is the champion of the Rose your enemy? The Rose of Elil. The flower of mercy. We have found a leader. Who are you, master? I am Hasan Albukir, prince of Baghdad. Sworn enemy of Alquazar. Carpet, back! Back! Algquazar will not easily be destroyed. Whoever possesses the Rose need fear no evil. Use the Rose against the tyrant Alquazar. Our troubles are over. We don't need weapons. This is the sword of freedom! No. The Rose of Elil is a symbol of truth, honor, and mercy. It cannot be used as a means for violence or bloodshed. Alguazar will be destroyed... By my own hand. By the sword! Lead us to victory! The carpets are bewitched. The magic of the Rose has given these carpets life, Hasan. These are the chariots we need. Give me the Rose, Khasim. The Rose, Khasim. I saw it... There in your grasp. And yet you return to me empty-handed. Because of you, I've lost a prize beyond all others. A prize beyond the dreams of Solomon! Down! And yet you call yourself my loyal servant. - You scum! - Caliph... You stink of spittle in the dust, you interiors of a diseased worm! - I beg of you! - This is your reward. Have... Now, Bahloul. Achmed has seen the prince Hasan, my lord. That cannot be. He was destroyed. He lives, Caliph. And he has the Rose. He is with the rebels now, master. Then you must deal with them, Bahloul. And spare no one! It may not be that simple, Caliph. He has already used the magic of the Rose, o' Caliph, to give his warriors power in the air. Now they fly on carpets and his foot soldiers already sing of victory on the ground. Achmed. This toad was once your master. Perhaps you should join him. Lord of Jadur, we are at your service. Why not put us to the test? A chance to redeem your past stupidity, perhaps? Then bring your misbegotten apes to me. To the palace and victory! On to victory! To the palace! To rush Alquazar! Out of sight, all of you! Open the gates! Keep your heads down! Movel It will be your privilege to lead my forces into battle. Yes, master. Thank you, o' gracious... Move, Achmed! Do not fail me. Yes, sire. Hurry, brothers! We shall be like hawks in the night! Hasan, look! Soldiers! Down there! Look! Let's go have a closer look! Kill the rebel dogs! Let no one escape! There they are! - Quickly, now! - Hold on, Majeed! Look! - Here they are! - Look out! - Look! Above! - The prince! We'll get him this time! They thought they'd beat us. Hasan! There! Achmed! Hold fast, Majeed! They're gaining on us! Faster! Faster! Faster! They're getting closer! We'll get them! - Kill them! - Get away! Get back! Get off! Take that! I got him! I got him! I got him! Hasan! Hold on, master! No escape for the two! We are going to get you now, prince Hasan! He's got it now! I'm going to skin you alive, cockroach! Prince Hasan, farewell! Watch out! I'll break your heads if you don't stop! - Let go! - You let go! - We are out of control! - You did it! We're going to crash! - Look... look out! - Bye-bye! I'm going to go over the edge! Achmed! - Close the gate! - Grab something! That way we'll show them how brave men can die! Hasan, the Princess. Hasan! Master! Come on! They're gaining! Jump, Chetti, jump! I'll take care of them. Hasan! Hasan! Hasan. Mine! Hasan! Now I am master of the world. All that is good is at an end. One simple ritual and the Rose will serve forever the cause of darkness. I will possess all the riches of the world. Its kings will grovel before me. And I will be denied nothing. The scum of Jadur fight for their freedom. But I will set their souls in bondage for a thousand years. You gave your word! Release me! Set you free? Never! Give me the Rose... Or I will feed your flesh to the dogs of Jadur. Your evil cannot touch me. Majeed. Vahishta brought you to this place. - In her name, trust... - Be silent! What must I do? Only the talisman can release me. Give it to me! Give me the Rose. My power cannot die. You are the father of all lies. Alquazar is dead! Algquazar is dead! Alquazar is dead! Alquazar is dead! Alquazar is dead! Free the prisoners! Long live Hasan and the Princess Zuleira! Great prince, I speak for the people of Jadur. We pledge our hearts to serve you as free men. The days of evil are over. Long live the Caliph Hasan. -- English --
