What's up? This is K107, broadcasting on New Year's Eve. Why don't you all scribble down those New Year's resolutions, dial me up, tell us those lies you're telling yourself-- promises you know you won't keep. I don't believe in New Year's resolutions. They're stupid. I promise this year I will not-- No matter what John says, this year I'm starting my catering business. And if I do ever let Russell come back, I'm gonna whip something on him so tough. I'm gonna lose 10 pounds and eat right. Fifteen pounds. Okay, 35. Thirty-five pounds. ** Do you know where you want to be tonight... and where you want to be next year? Think about it. 'Cause we're getting close to that final hour. So if you haven't finished those New Year's resolutions, you better jump on it before it's too late. I've made mine. How about you? This is brand-new from the beautiful Chant√© Moore. "Wey U." K107. Check it out. ** The deal is, the men in Denver are dead. No wonder I'm changing towns again. It's got to be better in Phoenix. ** I gotta pick up the babysitter, pick up my gown, stop and get John's tux. Ooh, I'd clone myself, but I wouldn't have time for the surgery. I don't know why I always pick the wrong men to fall in love with. My weakness is pretty boys with big sticks. I don't know why Tarik has to spend New Year's Eve with his homeys. He sees them every day. Plus there are gonna be all these drunk fools in the streets. He'd have more fun at home with me watching videos. I just want you to know... that if you're searching, somewhere there's a love for you. ** and I'm geeked up for a blind date that's not even all that. Just some party this guy's voice invited my answering machine to... when we got worn out playing phone tag. A long time ago, I asked God to send me a decent man. I got Robert, Cedric, Darrell and Kenneth. God's got some serious explaining to do. So my prayers got more detailed. Like, how about some compassion? Could he have a sense of purpose? A sense of integrity? Could he listen? The truth is, most men are deaf. They prefer to guess what you need. But they don't guess worth shit. They lie without a conscience. What they're best at is convincing us we should feel desperate. Thank God I don't fall for that shit. ** If I had the nerve, I'd get me some real breasts. Oh, I know that's gotta be Mama. She's the only one knows I'm staying in a hotel. I love you, Ma, but tonight-- I'll call you in the morning, Ma. ** I do not feel like going to another one of these boring affairs. Bernie? Yes? Would you be terribly disappointed... if we didn't go to the party tonight? Crushed. What? I guess there's no appropriate time to tell you this, but... I'm going to the party, just not with you. She-- She? Yes. She doesn't want to be alone tonight, and I was thinking, "Why should she be?" It's that bitch who keeps your books, isn't it? And you picked tonight to flaunt your whore... in front of all your business partners and your friends. What the hell are they supposed to think, John? The truth. Finally, the truth. I'm leaving you for her. This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test. Don't worry. You can have the house. And you know I'll take care of my kids. You wait a minute. I give you 11 fuckin' years of my life, and you're telling me that you're leaving me for a white woman? Would it be better if she were black? No. It'd be better if you were black. Thank you, Bernadine, for making this easier... for me. I'll be back next week for my things. [ Emergency Tone Continues, Stops ] This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System. All right. Time to get your groove on. "All Night Long." I don't believe I'm spending New Year's Eve by myself. Now, this is definitely a first. Finally gave up on Russell. A lyin', sneaky, whorish Pisces. Russell was so fine. Probably... every woman in America wanted to be with him. But you know what, Achey? Oh, I knew he was mine... till-- till I found that half slip in his gym bag. ** ** Phone's ringing off the hook tonight... from women wondering where all the real men are. So, for all you fellows out there running the streets... looking for love in all the wrong places, there's something you should know. Love might be waiting right there at home. Ma, I wish you were going out tonight. Hmm. I'm just fine, thank you. You're coming in at a decent hour tonight. Ma, it's New Year's Eve. Things don't start jumping off until midnight. You ought to be praising God I'm letting you go out at all, the grades you bringing in here. You know, you best get busy. You're gonna be using Morse code to contact them little girlfriends of yours. Look, I'm doing the best I can, so just ground me now. You know your father's coming on Tuesday. And? First of all, he's not my father. He's my daddy. - And there's a big damn difference. - Now, you watch your mouth. Look, I see the bastard once every two years, and I'm supposed to get excited? You get excited. I can't believe this, man. Why's she doing this? What is that supposed to mean? Where'd he sleep the last time he was here? Oh, man. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ma, I'm sorry. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really-- I'm sorry. That's none of your business. I'm sorry. ** This is K107, broadcasting live from the Hermosa. And this is where the party's going down. Why are you sitting there when you could be sitting here in my room? Let Brandy tell you. Check it out. K107. ** * Seems like ever since * - * The first day we met * * There is no one else * * I think of more than you * * Can't seem to forget * * Can't get you out of my head * * Guess the verdict's in * * I'm crazy over you * * How can one be down? * * Tell me where to start * * 'Cause every time you smile * * I feel tremors in my heart * ** Excuse me, is anyone sitting here? No. Please, join us. She has her nerve, sitting down here. Hell yeah. I'm single and desperate and have no morals. And as soon as one of you turns your back, I'm gonna flirt my butt off... and then take your man. Can't stand women like her. Please. Mmm. ** * I'm just a mess with a thing for you * * Pray that you'll invest * Savannah? Lionel? Hi. How are you? God, if this man isn't the one, at least let me dance till I sweat. Would you like to dance? I'd love to. All right. God, you look so beautiful tonight. Thanks. I'm certainly glad we finally met. You made it here safely in one piece. Well, our answering machines almost moved in with each other. Glad we met too. ** * I'm gonna make you my wife * * 'Cause you're my everything * * All my hopes and dreams * * Come true * * I can live my life * * With you * Mmm. You feel so good. * I'm gonna buy you some rings * Thank you, Jesus. And then I did it. I closed my eyes... and I exhaled-- * What you make me feel * and pretended this man was mine. That he was everything I ever dreamed of. That he was the one... I'd been waiting for all my life. Lionel. Lionel. You haven't danced with me all night. Uh, Savannah, this is my friend Denise. * Cross my heart and hope to die * If I hurry, I can still catch Dick Clark. ** What's up, Joseph? I like them pants. Well, thank you, girl. Hey, Joseph, did he show up? Hmm! You think he didn't? Come on, honey, you next. Ooh, Gloria, look at this. Oh. That's nice. It's very nice. Looks just like in the book too-- Hey, Gloria, do you like this color? I'm charging you 25 cents for each finger, Robin. You're gonna charge me what? Robin, why don't you just come on out of my shop, go back to that little hot-shit insurance company you working for? Because, baby doll, I don't punch in or out. I got it like that. Remember? Lunch hour is over. So I guess you guys have heard, huh? What? John left Bernie. What? Mm-hmm. And for a white girl. You lyin'. For a white girl? Honey, if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'. I saw her just the other night at the Circle K, and she was a mess! Honey, her hair was in rollers. She had a funky old bathrobe on. Girl, I had to take my girlfriend home. Joseph, are you serious? As a heart attack. Be still, baby. I don't wanna burn your scalp. Gloria, I told you he was an asshole. Shh. Excuse her, baby. I'm sorry. Watch your mouth in here. Five-three-seven-- Are you calling? Let me talk to her. Wait a minute. Let me talk to Bernie. It's the machine. Bernie? This is Gloria. Honey, you call me at the shop, okay? We wanna know what's going on over there. Now don't-- Bernie, how dare that son of a bitch leave you with two kids! Will you-- Don't talk that up in here. Joseph. Go on back to your job. I will see you on Tuesday. Okay, girl. Oh, my goodness, Miss Monroe. Bernie? this is Gloria. Honey, you call me at the shop, okay? We wanna know what's going on over there. Now don't-- Bernie, how dare that son of a bitch leave you with two kids! Hi, Bernie. It's Savannah. I'm here. Call me. I'm at the Biltmore. [ Machine Clicks, Beeps Twice ] Hey, hey, hey. Hug? Thank you. John, let's go! Oh! John has to kiss his mom first. Thank you. Mama's boy. Bye. This motherfucker is psychotic. I bet you there's serial killers less anal. That white woman is probably the only one who will tolerate your smug ass! Yeah, I was your white woman for 11 years! Couldn't have started that damn company without me! Hell, I worked my ass off! I mean, I got a master's degree in business, and there I was his secretary, his office manager and his computer! "No, Bernadine, you can't start your catering business this year! Why don't you wait a few years, huh? Yeah, don't start it right now. Wait one, two, three years. I need you to be the fuckin' background to my foreground! 732! 732! The number of times we made love! I remember when that bastard told me he was counting! Right after 51! I'll show you! Fuck me for not leaving your ass then! But the worst-- oh, the fuckin' worst-- making my kids go to a school with only two other black children... because you don't want them to be improperly influenced! Well, guess what, John. You're the motherfuckin' improper influence! Get your shit-- Get your shit, and get out! * Since the day that Nanny came to stay with us * ** Ma'am. Were you aware that your car was on fire? Yes. Did you start this fire, ma'am? It's against the law to burn anything except trash in your own yard, ma'am. It is trash. This is a nice area. Luckily, a neighbor cared enough. The next time you want to burn something-- It won't happen again. Michael and I work for the same insurance company. Mmm. He's just been promoted onto my marketing team. ** Michael is no Russell. I mean, he's not pretty. But he is available. Oh! A Kodak moment. Michael had to be about a 38D. My brain was saying, "Put your hands anywhere else but on my body. Then go home. ** [ Michael Singing, Indistinct ] And don't come back, you human submarine sandwich. ** But you can't say that kind of thing... without hurting someone's feelings. Oh, go, Robin. Go, Robin. Come here, baby. Ooh. You feel even better than I thought you would. Come here. I got you. You got me? I got you. Whoo! Ooh! Ooh! You all right? Yeah. I'm sorry, baby. It's okay. Hey! Ooh! Ahh! Yeah. All right. All right. Here I come. Here I come. Here I come. All righty then. Somebody's gotta undress me. Ooh. At dinner he told me he drag races, scuba dives, deep-sea fishes and keeps his own boat in the White Mountains. I told him I grew up an army brat. That I went to A.S.U. and I majored in anthropology. I knew you were gonna be beautiful all over. Uh, uh, uh! What? Here you go. All right. You need some help? No. No. There. There. Damn! I didn't even get a chance to see what he had to offer. Oh, yeah. Oh! Yeah. Yes. Yes. Ooh, shit. Oh, shit. God! Shit is good, huh? Shit is good. Oh, it's good. What's my name? Say my name. Say my name. What's my name? What's my name? Michael. What's my name? Michael! Yeah! Uh! Oh, shit. Oh, this is good. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. Ooh, it's good. Ooh, yeah. Ooh! Ooh! * I love it when you call me Big Poppa * Ah! Ooh! Big Poppa. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Whew! Whew! Pow! Does he think he just did something here? Shit. I could've had a V8. Oh! I knew you were gonna be somebody special. How do you feel? About what? Me. Uh-- This. You know, uh, everything. Tell me what you want. What you need. Because whatever it is, I'm gonna see that you have it. What's your fantasy? I mean, what do you want from a man? Everything. Could you be more specific? I want to have a house... in Scottsdale. I own a house... in Scottsdale. What else? I want to get married. And I want to have kids. Two. Maybe three. And? I want to eat out... two, maybe three times a week. I want to have babies. I want to go away for long weekends. I want to have a family. I want to be happy. You don't want much. I could give you that and a whole lot more. What about you, Michael? What do you want? Robin, I think I found it. You don't even know me. It's about knowing me. I could give you everything you want, everything you need... if you let me. You can start by kissing me. No. Slowly and gently. And he did it right. And I felt like silk. And when I looked at him, I didn't care anymore that he wasn't Mr. Universe. I just felt young... and sexy, beautiful. And when I closed my eyes... and squeezed my pelvis real tight, and my body exploded from the inside out, Michael felt just like the real thing. And everything was perfect-- for once. Hey, girl. How you doing? Oh, Bernie. So good to see you, girl. I've been waiting all day for you. You okay? Come on. Let's go get a drink, huh? I bought some toys for the kids. Come on. Don't drink too much. This stuff is expensive. Um-- I'd just like to make a toast to my beautiful wife... on our fifth anniversary. Here you go. Thanks, baby. Glad all you could be here. So... happy anniversary. Happy anniversary. Nice house, Bernie. At five dollars, you can have it. Remember when we took that? You know what's funny? I always thought if I gave him what he needed, he'd give me what I needed. I love you. I love you too. It's amazing what can happen when you give a man control over your life. I can't even... Let me put it on you. pretend it's all John's fault. So-- Tell me about this new job. Go home. Shut that off. Well, I took a pay cut... to see if I have what it takes to produce. You know, some of us are still on that dream trip, girl. Are you scared? Yes. Me too. * My love * Okay. * Sweet love * * For me, there's no one better * * Cross my heart * Hi! Gloria. Come on in. When David was here last time, he did me a favor by spending the night. Lord, let him be merciful again tonight. Well, have a seat. Well-- You're looking healthy. Thank you. Oh, well-- * I could not love you more * * 'Cause with you * * My world * * Is filled with so much pleasure * So, where's Tarik? He's not here right now. I don't know why I continue to do this. He's almost grown. Yes, he is. Would you like some wine? No. No, thanks. Sure? Mmm. * Nothing else matters * * You're my heart * When exactly are you expecting him? Mmm! Tomorrow. Wait! David. You know you can always stay here. Here? Yeah. Uh-- I thought that maybe we-- you know. We could-- Well, like last time. I should be honest with you. About what? About me. What about you? Hmm? Do you remember how I didn't respond to you last time? Of course I remember. I-- I thought it was because I gained weight and-- I have been bisexual for years. What You heard me right. But I'm not anymore. I'm gay. David! David, you don't have to go to this extreme just because-- Look, Gloria, I don't have to lie about this. I-I've lied too long as it is. I am. I'm staying at the Biltmore. And if... he ever wants to see me, he has to make the first move. If I don't hear from him by noon, I'm checking out. And I mean just that. Oh-- Come on. It's an offer you can't refuse. Okay. Ooh! Onika, honey, put that one over there too. Ma, are we just selling daddy's stuff? Yes, honey. Here you go. Thank you. Why come? Ooh! "Why come?" Oh, Onika. "Why." Why? Because he asked me. Yes. It's just collecting dust. Oh, uh, bring the wine. Hurry. Come on. I'll get it. She told me to get it! No, she told me to! She told me! Give it to me! No! Oh, man. Look what you did. - That's right, sir. Thank you. Enjoy your skis. Mmm! ** * My funny valentine * * Sweet comic valentine * * You make me * * Smile * * With my heart * ** I didn't think I'd ever see him again. But he did call to apologize. That's my toothbrush! Is he crazy? Turns out this guy has no real income. Chain-smokes reefer. Brags about being a vegetarian, then inhales three hot dogs... like it's the last time somebody's gonna buy him a meal. I gave him $20 for gas, which came to $7.18, and he didn't even give me my change. My fantasy was to get myself a little piece. You know, get my feet wet in a new town. Well, not exactly my feet. Hell, it's been five months. And he has gotten on my last nerve. But I don't have to be in love with him to do it. Hell, my body needs this. ** * Don't, baby, don't * * Don't you change your hair for me * Lionel, baby, um, we've got all night. You can take your time. I'm just so excited. I've been thinking about what I'd do to you since New Year's. Hold on, baby. I'm on my way. What? "Grr"? "Grr," huh? Now I'm a keeper at the damn zoo. Kathleen. John, the year-end reports... on the Geary account are right here. Everyone have a copy? Thank you. If you examine the profile on the Geary report, you'll find-- Bernadine, I'm in a meeting here. If you need something, I suggest-- Would you mind terribly if I had a few words with my husband? - No-- - What the hell are you doing? I've been to the bank. Thank you! Thank you for thinking of your children! Everybody out! Yes, out! Out! You don't come into my office... and start throwing some tantrum because you can't finish what you started. What am I supposed to do for money? I gave you the house. Now sell it! I hate you! I'm really sorry to hear that, Bernadine. But I'm not playing games with you anymore. Who do you think started this damn company, huh? Let's not start that again, all right? And now you think you can just take the money and run! Business hasn't been good for years. But don't you worry about it. You'll get what's coming to you. Hell, I'm not worried. You, on the other hand, should be. Okay. Look. Let's not let this thing get any uglier than it already has. Is everything all right in here, Mr. Harris? Fine. Now, I'm willing-- I'm more than willing-- What, you gonna put me out, Joe? to give you $300,000 cash today! You here to put me out? Your children aren't for sale. One more thing before you go. I'm coming for my kids on Saturday. Yeah? And if I hear you had them anywhere near that tramp bitch, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life! ** Tarik? Get out of my goddamn house! I'm-I'm sorry. Get out! I'm sorry. Ma, I'm so sorry. I told you you was grounded. I know. That's why I invited her over, Ma. I'm sorry. You know, I'm about sick of this shit! If your daddy wasn't gay, I swear to God, I'd send your black ass straight to him! Shit. You saying my father's a faggot? I don't like to use that word. Ma. Faggot, gay, homo-- it's all the same. So my daddy's a queer. My daddy-- My daddy's a queer. My daddy's a queer. Yo, my father's a queer! He's a fucking queer! My father's a fucking queer! I said stop it! One thing's for sure. It ain't running in the family. 'Cause, you know-- You best watch your mouth. I'm sorry. Sorry? You're sorry? You're sorry about everything, aren't you, Tarik? You're sorry about lying to me! You're sorry about your grades! Sorry about letting some little girl in here to suck on your little 17-year-old dick! How can I trust you in Spain if I can't trust you here, huh? You just get out of my face. Ma, will you just let me-- You better get out of my face. Now, this is something we should definitely focus our attention on this quarter. This account comes up for renewal June 1. The workers' comp premium is about a million and a half, and the loss experience has been excellent. What does the engineering report show? It shows an active safety environment. Well, actually, I, uh, found a discrepancy in the report. Oh, really? Hmm. Now, if everyone could turn to page 20, we can look at the graph. Page 20. If you'll excuse me. So you want to do your job? Well, you will never get another whiff of this. Yes? So it appears that everything he's purchased... in the last 10 years is in his name only-- including the business. Look, I'm not trying to get rich here. But I want to be able to pay my mortgage... and take care of my children. Their education. I just want to be okay. All right? Look. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're in for a fight. But I promise you, I will do my best. Bernie, this is the stupidest move you've made yet. Just because you're upset with your husband-- I love you, Gloria, but I'm not gonna debate this with you. I'm not here for a lecture. But I've been doing your hair for 11 years. One ignorant move by your husband, you gonna come in and chop off all of your hair? Now come on, Gloria. Do it. I'm not doing this. What is the fuckin' big deal? Just cut it, Gloria! No, I'm not! You gonna wake up tomorrow feelin' stupid-- All right! Fuckin' fine! You don't wanna cut this fuckin' shit off my head, I'll do it my goddamn self! Fine. Fine. You want me to cut it, I'll cut it. How short do you want it, huh? You want it shorter than mine or short as mine? You know, I can always use a razor too. I can't believe you. Eleven years of growing your hair out, and look at what you doing. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Fine. ** I don't know why they call this mess "happy hour." Well, it's still early yet, girl. Oh, sweetie, that's not it. Is this your first time hanging out? I hate to be the one to break it to you, but... this is as good as it gets. Mmm. I feel like dancing. All right, girl. Don't hurt yourself or nobody else. Mmm! You go, girl! How you like that new haircut? I don't like it. I don't either. I like it. You like it? Yeah, it look all right. It's nice. It's sharp on her. Hello, stranger. Bernadine, how are you? Wonderful, thank you. Ooh, that's Herbert Webster. Used to be a pro football player. Now he's a newscaster or a sports agent. And fine as hell. And if she don't want him? Mmm! I'll slam-dunk him tonight. He's also very married. And? She's only dancing with him, y'all. Damn. Are you blind? Look at her. Mm-mmm. She flirtin' with that man. Mmm! Shoot, I could be home watching Good Times. Why aren't you deadbeats out here dancing? Now, you can drink and talk at home. Girl, you're too hot for me. You better watch out for that man. Who Oh, he's harmless. Besides, if his wife's at home, he better watch out for me. Ooh! Give me some. Ooh! You're bad. Well, I guess that means he's available. You know you wanna dance. Why, thank you. Yeah. * Baby, baby * Oh, I don't even believe this shit. Uh-oh. What's the deal? Who is it this time? What's going on? I mean, it's only been a week since I fired him, and he was talking marriage. Well, don't forget you dropped him. And please don't embarrass yourself. And please don't embarrass us. Please. Oh, I wouldn't give him the satisfaction. Little fat fuck. Robin, did you see Michael? Oh, she saw him. Michael who? * Just the other day * * And your own sister told me * * Someone was taking my place ** I've only known Troy for three days, but already I feel close to him. I wish he didn't smoke, but I can live with one bad habit. Yeah, he's real cool people. He's a lawyer, but he's down to earth. You'll like him. Mmm. ** ** Oh, oh, oh, oh. Whoo! Whoo! Oh, shit! Oh! My favorite Caucasian, Wild Bill! Troy. The good stuff is here. Oh, man. Check out my honey, huh? Mmm. Bill, Robin. Robin, Bill. Hey, would you like some wine? No. I don't think we have time. You just got here. Oh, come on, woman, we got time for a glass of wine. Go and relax yourself. * Make a brother moan No need to stop, baby That shit turns me on * Stop! Whoo! Ha!

Baby! Got that wine. Troy, I'm ready to go. Come on, woman, these are my-- No! I'm ready to go now. Oh, that shit turns me on. * That shit turns me on Yeah, yeah ** Hey, Vannah, this is Mike. I got a few questions on the Colin Powell episode. Ring me at extension 455. Miss Jackson, this is Doreen. I've got a few messages for you at the front desk, along with a FedEx package. Thank you. Savannah, this is Kenneth. Hope you haven't forgotten me. I'll be out your way next month for a medical conference. It would mean a lot to me to see you. Hope you're well. Bye now. God, I used to crave this man. He treated me like a lady. And once you get used to being treated well, you can't go back to bullshit. No mystery how he got my number. Hello? Hi, Mama. How you doing? Well, since you ask, my hair ain't been dyed in so long, my roots are green. Mama, why did you give Kenneth my number? 'Cause he asked for it. Why? Is he coming out there or something? You tell me. Girl, he gonna be out there on the 26th. Ain't you excited? Mama, the man is married. Well, how happy can he be if he went out of his way to find me to get to you? Mama, please. Please my behind, girl. I'll be so glad when you get up off that high horse. And stop trying to act like you don't need nothing or nobody. Every woman needs a man. And you ain't no exception. Mama, I love you, and I'll talk to you soon. Good-bye. I won't squeeze him back when he hugs me. I will not look him in the eyes. And I'm definitely not gonna give him any. Hey. Hey. Hey. See? Told you about all that. Ol' feisty thing. See, you making too much about all this. It ain't even about nothin'. Girl, am I gonna have to whip it out and tame you? Am I gonna have to tame you? Hey, you feel that? See how hard that is? You did that, girl. It's got your name on it. Troy, you know what? I think we should cool out for a while. This is not working. Well, you know, this comes at sort of a bad time. And why is that, because you want some tonight? No, I'm not talking about tonight. I'm talking about Sunday. My mother wanted me to invite you over for a barbecue. Oh, you think I'm making all this up 'cause you mad? You mad Huh? Well, here. Why don't you call her? Why don't you call her? 555-1467. Troy, why do you want me to meet your mother? I have only known you for three days. Maybe it's because I feel a little different about you... than you seem to feel about me. But I can't help that. Robin. No man ever asked me to meet his mother before. Maybe he's not into the stuff all that much. And maybe if we got to know each other better, I might be a good influence on him. ** He thinks he's gonna get away with it? I'm not gonna let him get away with it. That's right. You know he has a whole apartment building, 200 acres of farmland in California... and a vineyard right here in Arizona? And did you know they made wine in Arizona? Yeah. Huh? Well, I didn't. Girl, this mess will get you a week on Sally Jessy. I'm tellin' you, Glo. This is how women get screwed. Too lazy to look out for yourself, so you put all your trust in your husbands. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I finally got the answer. Just never get fuckin' married. Hmm. Lots of us got that answer. I thought you had the answer to something. You had the answer to that one, honey, you'd be on the cover... of Cosmo, Newsweek, Psychology Today, Jet, Essence, Ebony! Don't make me laugh. I'm mad. Mad magazine! ** And they're off, in the first race of the ostrich festival! - And it's Swift Kicker in the blue takes the lead. Bern, if I ask you something, will you promise you won't get mad? What is it? You been messing around with Herbert? Swift Kicker and Exactly, and it's Swift Kicker by a nose! Bernie! I spent one evening with him. Look, I didn't want to marry him. I just-- I-I wanted to, you know-- I needed to get laid, so I did. Now how you gonna say something like that? Easy. Men been doing this shit for years. Hmm. I'm telling you, it was like watchin' paint dry. Girl, now he callin' and pagin' me all hours of the day and night. Showed up at my house unannounced. My child answers the door. Now, you know that freaked me out. Uh-huh. I don't know what he's thinking. Mmm. I tap-danced for a man for 11 years. I'm not about to go out and get me a new owner. Mmm. Yeah, Bernie, but you know you're wrong. Now, see, that's why I didn't want to tell you. I'm not like you, Gloria. I... need somebody to hold me. Hmm. Even if it is a damn lie. Hmm. Lady Lydia, Fancy Nancy and Patty's Pucker... coming up in that lady llama race. Don't forget about the arts and craft fair next weekend. Girl, Russell's been paging me all day, but I'm through with him. I'm seeing Troy now. Yeah, yeah. But you know what he does, Robin. He says he only does it sometimes. Girl, what do you expect him to say? "I'm a crackhead"? So, you think I shouldn't go to the barbecue? Robin, let me put it to you this way. What have you done in three days with this man, besides screw him, that would make knowing you so deep... that now he wants to take you home to meet his mama? A barbecue? Please, girl. Yeah. I can't call him though. I put his card in my wallet. Now I can't seem to find my wallet anywhere. Oh, that really surprises me, Robin. Hold on. Mm-hmm. Hello? I been missing you, baby. Since when? Since I been gone. Want some company? Yes. I'll see you in 15. Bye, Russell. Savannah? Yes. I gotta go. Something I gotta do. Is it Russell? No, it's not Russell. Mm-hmm. I bet. So what if it is? Well, enjoy the lowlife while you can, girlfriend. Good-bye. That girl is something. ** * Anytime that you feel the need * * And I'll be there in a hurry * Come on, baby. Troy is such a waste of my time. Come on now. Come over here. Russell's the only man I really loved. Look at him. What are you acting like you don't wanna come over here? Damn. Mmm. Last time we were together, he wanted to spend the whole night. And he would have-- except he had to take his mama to church early the next morning. People change. And you can't hold a few mistakes against someone for the rest of their life. ** ** God bless you and your family. Sister Gloria, you're looking good. Have a good day now, Deacon. God bless you, sister. Deacon Scott. God bless you. Take care. Hi. Savannah, let's go have breakfast. Let's go get something. What? I'll cook. You know I'll cook. ** * Everything's gonna * * Be all right * * Everything's gonna * * Be all right * Give me a hug. Hey, John Jr.-- What's up, Ma? Hey. Mmm! I missed you. Enjoy the doll, okay? Bye, Daddy. Thank you. Bye. Hi, Mama. Hi, sweetie. Two days is too long, huh? Come on. Let's go inside, huh? ** Whew! Shit, it's hot. Damn. Hey! Hey! Yoo-hoo! Robin! Hey! You ready, baby? I'm not going. Why not? Because, Troy, I don't like this. Y Okay. All right. So-So what am I supposed to tell my mother and my son and the rest of my family? Your son? How old is this son? He's almost 13. What's your point? My point is, I don't think we're ready for family reunions yet. What am I supposed to tell them, Robin? Tell them whatever you want to. Oh, so I'm just supposed to accept this? You don't have a choice. You should have asked me before committing me. - I did ask! - No, you told me! You come here two hours late, and I'm supposed to go with you? Oh, I don't think so. Robin! Robin! It's locked, Troy. Baby, it's too hot for this shit. Can you come get the door? No. Can I use your bathroom? Hell no! Do you have any idea how many women would love for me... to take them to my house so they can meet my mother? Oh, I can just about guess. Man, you black bitches is all the same. "Bitch"? You complain all the time... about don't nobody want your asses, don't know how to treat ya! As soon as a man-- a brother-- show you genuine interest, you bitches act simple. Then you wonder why we go out with white women. A white woman can have your sorry ass. Don't you throw that up here! You raggedy bitch. You better be more careful who you pick up in grocery stores next time! Troy, take your drunk-ass, leather-wearing- in-the-summertime, need-a-shave, stinky-ass home. I'm not going. Have a fruit bowl, tramp! Punk! Forget you! Forget you! All right. It's like that? It's like that then. Bye. ** So, Robin, I guess you know who's got your wallet? What? You think he stole it? Robin, I don't believe you. Good-bye. I got to hang up. Whew. Hi. I'm Gloria Matthews from across the street. I was wondering-- What do you know about these people moving in here? Well, uh, the guy, in my opinion, seems to be nasty and, uh, ignorant. And bossy. Oh. What about his wife? Well, she-- she died a couple of years ago. But this is one of the many precious items that she bought for him... that I'm makin' sure don't get broken. Oh, that's nice. Why is he trusting you with it? Well, I'm Marvin King. Yeah. I'm your new neighbor. I was just foolin' around. Oh. Nice to meet you, Gloria. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Well, I'd just like to welcome you and your family to the neighborhood. Thank you. Unpacking can be hard work. Yeah. Yeah, it certainly is. I got a lot more to do tomorrow too. Would you like to have dinner with us tonight? It's just leftovers. Collard greens and corn bread, some candied yams, a little potato salad, fried chicken, peach cobbler, few slices of ham. Mmm. Yum-yum. Yeah, I-I would love to, Gloria, but, uh-- I just got too much work to do here. Maybe another time. Yeah. Well, to be honest, I don't have no business eating it myself, big as I am. Mmm. Yeah, well, my wife was a big woman. Oh. I like that. I like a woman with a little meat on her bones, you know. Oh. Well, I could send a plate over by my son Tarik for you. Great. Yeah. I'd appreciate that. How old's your boy? Seventeen. Teenager. He's gonna be leaving in June, I think. Excuse me. What did you ask me? I said, uh, Tarik-- Tarik-- he's going to college, huh? Oh. Um, he wants to travel around the world... with this organization called Up With People. I'm just not sure I-- Yeah. Let him go. He's young. Up with the people. Yeah. Uh, where's his daddy? In California somewhere. Look, um, Marvin. I'll let you get back to your work. And, um, I'll send that plate right on over. Thank you. Thanks, Gloria. Yeah. Yeah. Nice meetin' ya. Hope to see you again real soon. Oh, God, I hope he's not watching me walk away. All right. He's watching. Oh! ...grant the petitioner $3,000 per month... until such time as we're fully able to review all newly submitted documentation. Next. This is only round one. Stay strong, Bernadine. Stay strong. Look. I want this to be over and done with. Handle it. Let's just take it step by step. It's taking a toll on my kids. You sorry son of a bitch, John. You know the mortgage is 5,000 a month. How are your children supposed to live, huh? I told you to settle for the 300,000, but you want to play hardball. All dogs don't go to heaven, John. You think you can get away with this, huh? You lowlife ass-kissing Uncle Tom. You know, this-- This "Uncle Tom" stuff-- It's really becoming a bit redundant, don't you think, Bernadine? Excuse me. ** Scotch and soda, please. Yes, ma'am. Here you go. Thank you. ** Excuse me. Is anybody sitting here? No. No one's sitting there. Uh, cognac, please. Yes, sir. ** My name is James Wheeler. How do you do? Your cognac, sir. Thank you. So do you have a name? Bernadine. Bernadine. My, this is a... pretty place. But I have to admit, I haven't seen anything as splendid as you since I've been here. Okay. Oh, hold on now. Hold on. You don't have to give me that look. Just look. I haven't seen the sun for four days now. I mean, it's been one meeting after the other, after the other. And now I am finished. So, I decided to come downstairs, have myself a drink, and in the morning I look forward to returning home... to my lovely wife. Salud. So, why are you sitting here all alone? Okay. Wait. Hold on now. You don't have to answer that. You don't know me. You know? I mean, you don't know me from a can of paint. Here I am, all in your Kool-Aid and don't know the flavor. I'm getting a divorce, James. Ah. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, well, it happens, huh? And you know, it just occurred to me that, uh, I've lost something that once meant everything, and it hurts. And right now, I'm just-- I'm really pissed about it. Mm-hmm. But you know what really gets me? I didn't have plan "B." My marriage was supposed to last. Mm-hmm. Mmm. So I guess that's why I'm here. Hmm? I can tell you one thing though. Yeah Well, you are one brave woman. You're bad. No. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I hope you recognize that. No, I don't really feel like that, James. Well, I mean, you're sitting here all alone. Ain't a black person in sight, and you're sitting here looking like everything is all right. You know, your makeup is flawless. Oh, come on now. I mean, you've taken his best shot, and you're still here. Mmm. Splendid. You just know me so well. No, no, no, no. I don't know you. But I do know a fighter when I see one. And I could tell that with one look in your eyes. What are you, a, um-- a psychiatrist or something? No. No. I am a civil rights attorney. My practice is in Washington, D.C. I'm going through something similar. My wife is dying. Oh. Of breast cancer. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that. It's-- Bernadine, have you ever watched someone dying? I tell ya. I mean, watching her suffer just kills... a bit of me every day. And the worst part is that I can't help but remember all the plans we made. You know, like we were supposed to retire in Saint Thomas, you know. Out there by the beach. And she loves the water. Get the coconut oil and rub it all over her. She is definitely a-- I tell you, I just-- I just wish I could have a piece of her that I could keep safe, you know. Just something. Something more than a bunch of memories. Anyway. You look like you're out. Mmm. How about a, uh-- a refill? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh, she'll take another whatever it is she got. Scotch and soda. Ooh. I'm scared of you. * Everyone falls * * In love sometimes * * Sometimes it's wrong * * And sometimes it's right * * For every win * * Someone must fail * * But there comes a point when * * When we exhale ** - Well, hello. - Hello. You look better than I remembered. It's funny. You don't. But I guess you couldn't. Oh, it's good to see you. You too. Well, I'm producing my first segment. Mm-hmm. Uh, it's only three minutes long, but it is a start. That's good. That's real good. I'm proud of you. All right, all right. Let's cut the bull. Are you gonna talk to me for real, or what? You know, I have to apologize for thinking I could just... pop back into your life after all these years. "Pop back" in my life? Yeah. Oh. I needed to see you. All right. So you've seen me. Now I can leave, right? I can go. Oh, man. There's so many things I want to say to you. Is that right? Things I've wanted to say ever since-- Well, ever since you dumped me. Dumped you? Can we revisit the real world here for a minute, Kenneth? Yeah. You stopped calling me. Oh, yeah. Well, took me a while to get the hint. The hint? Yeah. What hint is that? You never called me-- I never called you. to go anywhere, not even once. Kenneth. You're the man. And that wasn't the nature of our relationship, and you know that. Mm-hmm. I know. The nature of our relationship was that I was in love with a woman... who was too nice to hurt my feelings. You were in love with who? And what? Look. I know I'm married, and I love my daughter with all my heart. You see, her mother was five months pregnant when we married. Now that was my choice. I went in with my eyes open, and I've lived with it for seven years now. Now I don't want this to come off like some kind of come-on, but you are the only woman that I have ever loved. And I still love you, Savannah. * And I can't believe it's real * * Can't believe it's you * * I can't believe it's happening * * I can't believe it's true * * And I can't believe that you are here with me * * And I am here with you * * Kissing you * * Softly kissing you * * Kissing you * * Forever kissing you * * Kissing you * * Kissing you * * You * * I can't believe that you took me * * When I was choosing you * * Kissing you * * Forever kissing you * * Kissing you * * Oh, gently kissing you * * Kissing you * * Kissing you * * Kissing you * * Kissing you * * Kissing you * * Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ** You okay? Yeah, I'm just-- Yeah, I'm okay. Nervous. Oh. I'm-- I'm a little nervous. Well, I mean, if you're having second thoughts about me being up here. No, no. I'm-- I'm having all kinds of thoughts. Well, I mean, if it's any consolation, Bernie, I've never done this before. You sure? I haven't made love to a woman in over a year. Lauren stopped wanting to, so-- Um-- Look. I got two things I want to say to you. No, no. No. You don't have to... say anything. I do, because you may kick me out afterwards. Remember how you were saying that the woman your husband, uh, was marrying-- I mean, ex-husband-- that she was white? Yes. Well-- Well, so is my wife. Look, Bernie. I mean, I can sit here, and I can say that the reason I'm staying with her is because she's dying... or that it's my obligation or a whole bunch of st-- stuff, but the truth of the matter is-- I love her. She's the only woman I have ever loved. And I would never leave her under any circumstances. It hurts like hell. Yeah. Someone felt that way about me once. But he stopped. What do you want to do tonight? Make tonight beautiful. Beautiful. * I know if there is any chance * * For us to find our happiness * * We've got to learn to let it go * * Oh, forget all the pain we knew * * Sometimes * * Sometimes it hurts so bad, baby ** Marvin, please eat this sandwich. Mmm. Yes. Yes indeed. Ah, come on now. I'm just kidding. No, you weren't. I wouldn't do that. You were not. Can you hold that for me? Don't throw that away now. Ain't got no cheese on this sandwich. You don't like cheese. I brought the paint. Good. Sit it right down there, Tarik. You want a bite of this sandwich, Tarik? It got cheese in it? Here. Take a bite. ** ** * Happy birthday, dear Gloria * Oh! * Happy birthday to you ** - Oh! Thank you. To the best blow-dryin', scissor-scalpin', bumper-curlin', braidin', weavin', "get this gray out of my hair" dyein'... beautician west of the Mississippi. Happy birthday. - Oh. Thanks. - Weak! Gloria, I hope you find true love... and get you some that's so electric... you ain't gonna need no blow-dryer. Oh, please. And so juicy, it's gonna put an end to your 10-year drought. Oh! Nasty.

Let's help her out. * Love was always supposed to be * * Something wonderful to me * * To watch it grow inside yourself * * To feel your heart beside itself * * Sometimes it hurts * Why do they write these damn songs? To make you think and believe and dream... you could feel like this? Hmm. Shit. Somebody had to go through this shit in order to write it. Don't you think? * Sometimes the pain * * Is just too much * Shoot. You know what? You know what we all have in common? What? None of us-- not none of us... have a man. Some sad shit. * Always there inside of you * That lying asshole. * Oh * Messed up my life. * Sometimes it hurts to love so bad * * When you know you've given it your best * I should call him right now. * Sometimes it hurts to even laugh * * You feel a thousand miles from happiness * And I wanna talk to that bitch. * Sometimes the pain * * Is just too much * * And it hurts like hell * Hand me the phone. I'll talk to that ho. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on. Dial her number, Bernie. Wait, wait. Wait. Dial her number. What are y'all doing? - No. Put the phone down. Johnny No, it's not John, bitch. Robin. Savannah, talk to her. What happened? Bernie. Bernie, don't do this. Bernie. Bernie, don't do this. Gloria, I gave him two babies, and she thinks she can just take my fuckin' husband. Bernie! Bernie, cut. It's stupid. It's stupid, and it's childish. Thank you. Gloria, I had some shit I wanted to get off my chest. I'm hurt. Why'd you unplug the phone? Wh-What-- What happened to the music? I thought this was supposed to be a party. ** All right. Come on, baby. * Yeah * * Just keep it on the down low ** Ah! ** You already know. I'm sick of this shit now. Wait a minute. The one man I love... is married with a kid. And there's my life in one little sad nutshell. Mmm. Men do leave their wives. At least he told you he was married. Yeah, but, see, I'm not your average 24-year-old girl... who's willing to wait around and count the days, see. Mm-mmm. Uh-uh. I'm 33 years old. Ooh! Good! And I still look good. I still look good. You do. You do look good, girl. You said it, fly diva. Mm-hmm. Freak mama. The hoochie-coochie diva. No. All y'all go to hell. Savannah, you know you look good. You look good, girl. Whatever happened to the good old days? Oh. Good old days. What good old days? What good old-- Jinx. You know, the days when... men actually flirted with you... and-and-and asked you out for a real date, you know. Where are they hidin'? They're not hidin'. They're too damn scared to make a commitment. Mm-mmm. They're with white women. - They're gay. - Or married. - They're ugly. - They behind bars. Got bad credit. Got little dicks and can't fuck. That's what it is. Or they got big ones and still can't fuck. Ooh! Wait, wait. They want to spank it. What? They want to-- What? They want to what? Now that's not a bad thing, Gloria. Oh, Robin. Come on. They're too possessive. They want you to be their mama. And their daddy. And they're ugly. Baby, we already said they was ugly. Yes. Good and ugly. Inside out ugly? If you're ugly inside, you're ugly outside. Inside out. Geez. Who asked her? Happy birthday, Ma. Hi, Ma. Did I wake you? What difference does it make? I'm up now. What's wrong? Why you talkin' so low? Savannah? Are you there? Yeah. Yeah, Ma. I'm still here. Nothing's wrong. How are things with you? Well, they cut my food stamps to $57 a month. Ma, how the hell have you been getting by? What have you been eating? Oh, baby, see, I knew you would get upset, and I've been trying to deal with it on my own. The check, it's-- goes so fast, and things are so high nowadays. Ma, how much money do you have? Mmm. Sixty-seven dollars. Ma, be down at Western Union first thing in the morning. Okay? Baby. You know, Kenneth called, and, uh, he said that he was gonna be trying to come out there, with-- with him filing for his divorce and all. Well, did he call you? N-No. No, he hasn't. Well, then pick up the phone and call him. Because, Ma, I just don't know. I don't know if I can trust him, you know. Oh, girl, you're so crazy. Mama, do me a favor, okay? Yes? I don't care if it's a-- a knitting class or a new girdle-- Anything. I don't care what it is. You just pick up the phone and you call me, okay? All right, baby. And only me, Ma. Only you, precious. Bye. Hi. Yeah, sorry I didn't call after I got in. Oh, continuous introductions after a very long and tedious meeting. I was whipped. Yeah. One thing is certain. I'm gonna have to come out here a few more times before this deal's in place. Yeah. How's my baby girl? Well, you tell her that her daddy loves her. Yeah. Me too. Bye. Well, good morning. Well, good mornin'. And how are you today? I'm here with you. It's all good. Have your breakfast. I'll be back. I'll be here. ** * Inside yourself it's bad * This is gonna broaden his horizons, make him more worldly. He'll be fluent in Spanish. I know that. I just don't see why he has to go all the way to Spain... when he's already been accepted at Arizona State. I'm gonna miss him too. Who's talking about missing him? Look. He's a man, Gloria. He knows what he wants. Be proud you raised him that way. I am proud. It's just-- He's my baby. You just don't understand. I understand. I un-- Why you telling me all this? Well, I thought that since you've been coming over all these months, showing him how to fix things-- He's-- He's never known what it's like to have a father. You took him fishin'. He looks up to you. I thought maybe you could talk some sense into him. It seems to me Tarik isn't the one who needs to come to his senses. I-If you don't mind my saying so. Well, everybody's entitled to their own opinion. Good night. Gloria. Good night. * Feel so sad * * I thought I was over you * It's getting late. I better-- * But I keep crying * * When I don't love you * Good night. * So why does it hurt so badly ** ** Russell called and said he's leaving his wife for sure this time. Okay. So what's taking him so long? Russell? Russell, what took you so long? I wasn't gone that long. * Some just learn it on the way * Well, what happened? We talked. Well, I assumed that much. So? * Make it smooth Take your time * Is she gonna sign the divorce papers, or what? You just don't decide to divorce somebody and sign on the dotted line, baby. It doesn't work that way. I wish it did, but it doesn't. ** Why don't you get my pajamas? Pajamas? Now that's the first time you ever asked for those. Russell, did you sleep with her? I can't take comin' here and bein' pressured about what I'm doin' with my own wife. Well, you know we're not gonna have very much time to spend together. * Everybody knows how to make you scream * It's Troy. I can't talk right now. What, you can't talk now? Hey, look. Why don't you just say somethin' sexy to me so I can go to sleep? Who was that? Savannah. I suggest you tell your boyfriends not to call here after 11:00. He's jealous. What a joke. What the hell am I doin' anyway? * Said I shall not be moved * ** * Said I shall not be moved * * Just like a tree that's planted by the water * * Just like a tree * This Up With People's choir that's goin' to Spain-- is it this good? You mean the one you won't let me join? Nah. * Shall not be moved ** But they're close. After that selection, after that song-- After that song, somebody ought to say thank you. Thank you! Say "Praise the Lord." Praise the Lord! Say "Praise the Lord!" Praise the Lord! Turn to your neighbor, right where you're sitting, and say "The Lord"-- The Lord-- "is blessing me"-- is blessing me. "right now." right now. Amen. Amen. At this time, our prayers go out to Sister Lulu Mae Preston, who just had hip surgery. Church, I want you to know this morning that... God is able! And because we know that he's able, we will continue to pray her strength in the Lord. Amen. Amen. Sister Gloria Matthews... would like the congregation to send their prayers out... for the safe journey of her son Tarik, who'll soon be on his way to Spain for a year... to play the saxophone in the Up With People International Orchestra. Hallelujah! Amen! Amen. Oh! - Brother Tarik-- - Mm-hmm. Hold on to the Lord's unchanging hand. As you go on your journey, continue to trust in the Lord with all your heart. Amen. Amen. I mean, so what do you think, Robin? I've loved this man forever, and now that we've got another chance, I don't want to blow it by making him think I don't have any faith in him. Do you know what I mean? I mean, don't we hear this on Sally and Oprah every day? That's what you sound like, you know. Yeah, I know. Is that where you get your advice from Well, you know, there was this one woman in your same situation. Mmm. This man kept saying he was gonna leave too. She got her hopes all up and everything, quit her job, even moved to the city he lived in. Right after she got there, she found out she was three months' pregnant. He ended up dumping the woman. He said his kids would be too hurt if he left now. So what about the baby? So she had an abortion. She never, ever told a soul. Not even her mama. Hmm. She never looked at men quite the same again. So he left his wife in the end, right? Take a wild guess, Savannah. What show did you hear this on? Sorry. I've never been on Oprah. Where's my mom? I think my mommy left me. Have you seen my mom? Guess what I got. Uh, some tea. Guess. Picture you drew for me? I don't know, honey. I give. What is it? I got the mail, Ma. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. I'll be right back, okay? Okay. Hmm. Mama? I've waited as long as I could to contact you. Mommy, is "freak" a bad word? I've been thinkin' about you a lot, Bernie. Every day. All the time. I'm embarrassed to even write that down. But... it's true. Bernie, I fell in love-- in one night. Mama, I asked you a question. No, honey. No, it's not. You know what's even harder for me to understand... is that what I feel for you... has never undercut the love I have for my wife. Now how is that possible? Tabitha said it was a bad word. I still watch her every day. So beautiful. So brave. I just wanna give her everything I've got in me. Every moment. It's-It's-- It's not a nice word. She's hanging on, fighting to be here for me. And when she sleeps, I cry... over how amazing she is... and how lucky I've been to have her in my life. Can I say it? No. No. You're the only person in this world I ever knew I could tell this to. And even if this never finds you... and we never speak again, you've... changed... my... life. You know what inspiration is? It's someone who lets you know life will go on... and something beautiful can be waiting somewhere. Somewhere, when you least expect it. Mommy, what does it mean? What does what mean? Freak. It means "weird." You let me say "weird," so why can't I say "freak"? Because. Look, Mama. Mmm? Look at you. What? God stopped crying. I don't think those were God's tears at all. Just his way of making sure everything keeps growin'. Very romantic. And the food. I love the food. Mmm. Oh! We have to start planning. Your wedding. Hi, darling. So many plans. I'm sorry I'm late. Well-- My daughter's had a hundred and four temperature... for the past two days. Really? Turns out she's got the chicken pox. Oh, gosh. I mean, Paula's been beeping me on the hour, every hour, all damn day. Mmm. I told her all she had to do was give the girl an ice bath. Right. Or rub her down with some alcohol. Mmm. Jesus, you'd think she had malaria. So why'd you even come? Why? Because you are the most important thing in my life. Excuse me. Can I get you something to drink? No, thanks, for me. One of these days... she's not gonna have me around to bug about this shit. Mmm. You know, every trip I make out here, I dread going home. And the longer I think about it, the more I'm convinced that this is what I want to do... when the time is right. - Excuse me. - Thank you. I mean, it's more financial than anything right now. Ah. And there's still a lot of things that need to be worked out. - Mmm. - I know if I left right now, it would be the wrong time for my daughter. She thinks she's having a baby sister. A baby? So, we're going to have to wait a little bit longer than I expected. Yeah. But I know the kind of person that you are... that you wanna do the right thing as much as I do. Mmm. I do, Kenneth. I really do. You see, the more I think about it, the more I look at you, you look like... the scum of the fucking earth. You see, the good news is, Kenneth, is that I was never, ever in danger of you getting a divorce. Oh, no. I'm the lucky one. "The most important thing" in your life, meaning you'll abandon your wife and your child... to get laid every chance I give you. And you think-- you think the brass ring is some bogus promise to put me into Paula's shoes? So you can do the same fucking thing to me next year? It's pretty close to irresistible, lover man. What the hell's wrong with you? I mean, you and my wife working for the same fucking firm or something? You weren't this self-righteous when you were fucking my brains out. You weren't worried about my poor little wife then, now were you? You're right. You're absolutely right, Kenneth. I couldn't see past what I wanted. So that made me an asshole. But the difference between you and me... is I'm not anymore. Wait a minute. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is it? Now look. I'm sorry, but we need to talk about this some more. I mean, without all the anger. Look. I'm not mad. Really. Neither am I, baby. I'm not mad. And to prove it, the drinks are on you. Hey! Damn it. * Kissing you * * Kissing you * Excuse me, Savannah. You have a phone call. Thanks, Edy. Excuse me for a sec. Hello? Have you lost your mind? Ma? Kenneth just called me and told me how simple you acted. He was actually cryin'. And men don't be cryin' over no woman unless they love 'em. How can you be so insensitive? Could you excuse me for a minute, please? No problem. Thank you. First of all, Ma, I am sick of you telling me how I should live my life, who you think I should love, marry. Ma, I'm sick of it. Don't you raise your voice at me. Mama, I'm 33 years old, and I live alone. Mmm. Yeah. Tell me about it. Yes, and I may have to accept the fact that I may live alone for the rest of my life. It ain't too late, Savannah. He's begging on his damn knees, and you're letting him get away. Mama, do you hear me? I have a job. I have friends. Ma, I have interests that you don't even ask about... because only one thing counts with you, Mama. With any damn woman unless they lyin' to themself. Well, I'm being honest with myself, Ma. I'm smart, I work hard, and I'm a good person. Ma, if I allowed myself to think like you, I guess I'd be a dead woman. Ma, you should be proud I'd rather live alone... than crawl up behind some two-timing loser like Kenneth. He's a good man, Savannah. A good man. He's just in a bad situation right now, and he's trying to get out of it. Mama, I tell you what. Why don't you fuckin' marry him then? Ma. I was wrong to yell. I'm sorry. But I meant what I said about my life. But I didn't mean to disrespect you. I'll never do that again. It's all right, baby. It's all right. I just don't want to see you end up like me. Alone. I know, Ma. And I love you. I love you too, sugar. I'll talk to you later. Bye. After fully reviewing all the newly submitted documentation, the settlement will go as follows: One and a half million dollars in the Phoenix Municipal Savings and Loan Association, ownership of the residence at 1985 Ohio Drive in Pinnacle Peak, Arizona, a second house in Acapulco, Mexico-- Mmm. 500,000 in stocks and bonds... and an E320-S Mercedes station wagon. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're welcome. Did you hear that? Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Hey, baby. Surprised to see me? I finally got that bitch off my back like I told you I would. If that's what you want, I'm happy for you. Then why are we standing here in the hallway talking about it? Because I haven't invited you in. Come on, baby. It's me. It's Russell. Why you want to do this to us... after all we've been through, huh? Come on now. I said stop. What you readin'? Childbirth Choices. What's that about? Yeah. It's yours. And I'm keeping it. So what you expect me to do? What you do best. Disappear. Go home to your wife. Or better yet, go get some help. I don't want anything from you. I want you to read my lips. We don't need you in our lives. Yes! It's open. How you been doing? I haven't seen much of you lately. I, um-- I acted silly, when all you did was tell me the truth. I guess I didn't wanna hear it. I've been real busy. Um, I came over for two reasons. I know I shut you out, and, um, I miss you in our life. My life. Marvin, I have no doubt in my mind everything you said was true, and I-I apologize. I just came over to say that. Wait a minute. Wait. Come on in. Sit down. He just left. He wouldn't even let me take him to the airport. He's been the man in my life, you know. My companion. More than just my baby. Now he's gone. I, uh-- I gave up, and I-- a long time ago on any hope I had of finding someone for myself, and-- It's a terrible thing to do to Tarik. Tarik's gonna be fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'm grateful to you though for opening my eyes. I miss you too. You, uh-- You wouldn't allow my fear of being alone... to get in the way of him growing up and doing what he has to do, and-- I was so unfair to him. No, no. Yes, I was. No. You haven't been unfair to Tarik. You've been unfair to you. To us. It's like-- It's like you don't feel you're worthy to have someone to love you. No, I-- I love you. I love you. No, don't say-- Yes. You don't mean-- Yes, I love you. Gloria. We're moving into our New Year's Eve countdown. Guys, I don't feel like goin' to no club tonight. Me either. All right. Let's go somewhere different. I'm down. Yeah, me too. ...when Roberta Flack was saying "It Might Be You"? ** Who is this?

Marvin! Don't panic, and don't be afraid. Do that for yourself. Don't be sad. Get glad. This baby's gonna have more than one mama, girl. If you're mad, get even. Oh! But if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Whatever you do, do it this year. Whoo! Let's do this. Nine, eight, seven, six-- Hey! I think it's time! five, four, three-- two, one, two, one, Happy New Year.
