You sewed a new bag for your lunch-box! Yeah, yesterday. It's so cute! You're never idle. -We should all make one. - Sure. Oh,Watanabe, that's so tacky! You think so? I'm jealous. Of what? You have a skill. It's not that much of a skill. Sure it is! You can make a living doing that. You're going to study dress-making... Well, yeah... You've thought about your future... l want to get married. - Yuck! That's gross! - Sorry! - What the... - But did you hear what she said? Lt's not that strange. Things are just so easy when you get married after graduation. Hey... that's Endo. Who's she? She's in our class. And you don't even know her name! But I've never talked to her. You forget. Where's she going? The nurse's office? Is she sick? Or faking it. I remember now! She was suspended from school last year, wasn't she? It'd be hard to talk to someone who that happened to. But you know, she's got guts. Most people would've quit for good. Time to go. Hey, wait a minute! Oh, thanks. Here. - Thanks. - OK. There you go. - And yours. - Thanks. Mmm! As if we didn't eat this every day! 'As the industrial Revolution of the 18th century... '...is an event said to be the greatest such revolution in human history... '...it has had a vast historical influence. 'First it ensured the establishment of a capitalist society. 'There are two more points to note here, the first being... '...the "factory-production system", or "manufacturing".' Miss Kirishima... Am l keeping you awake? You won't learn if you're asleep, will you? I wasn't asleep. Then will you continue reading from where l left off please? You can't? That's because you are always falling asleep. 'The second point: 'Manufacturing replaced agriculture as the focus of social production. 'As a result, the capitalist owners of large factories... '...became a ruling class.' We'll stop here for today. I know. You weren't sleeping. I brought Endo. You can sit here. Where do you usually eat lunch? Huh? You're never around. With a girl from the next class who was in Grade 11 with me. You go in there? Yeah. I went at the start of the year, and l just kept going back. You always bring sandwiches? My mother slept in today, so she couldn't do rice for me. I know what you mean. My mom does that all the time. I make sure l get up for school. l wish she'd do her job, too. Once l had to buy a convenience-store lunch and sneak it into my lunch-box. That's terrible! - Yeah! - I was in tears over it. So you laugh sometimes, Endo... What does that mean? Here. Mom's making a rice pilaf. You'll stay to eat? I've never had a rice pilaf. - Never? - No. My mother doesn't make it. Then take some with you. Mom always makes lots. OK. She never makes anything with garlic in it. She hates it. Not even in gyoza dumplings or spaghetti. Each to his taste, l guess. I guess so. Are you shocked? No. l was admiring the way you struck the match. Won't you get caught? She knows. I still don't do it in front of her. Once she called me and l panicked and threw one in the garbage. Lt caught fire. Stupid! Hey, I'm sorry about today. About what? Everyone asking you all those questions. That didn't bother me. Why should it? That's OK, then. That sweet-bean pancake was good, out there on the roof. Yeah, it was. You've got a lot of CDs. I'll lend you one. This one's good. Do you know Aztec Camera? No. Can I look at this book? Sure, go ahead. So you like art? Sort of, l guess. It relaxes me. Hey, Endo... ...um... No, it's nothing. Forget it. What? Tell me. It's OK. Another time. - Tell me! - No. What is it? Tell me! - Nothing. - What? Kayako! Wash the dishes! Later. You'll forget! I'll do it! 'Morning. 'Morning. Did you listen to the CD? Uh... yeah. How was it? Lt's in English. l didn't really understand it. Oh. Sorry. l haven't listened to it yet. Oh, sorry. l shouldn't rush you. Can l keep it a bit longer? Sure you can. 'Morning! 'Morning. Oh, hi. I'm glad l saw you. I've had this CD of yours for ages now. Sorry about that. I'm done with it now. How was it? Great! I love it. I'll give you something harder next time, then. I can't wait. This is Kirishima. She's in my class. The lunch group? Yeah, that's right. This is Nakano. Last year we were in the same class. What a relief. I was worried you weren't making any friends in your class. Don't say that! Well, it's true! I know, I'll put some songs on a tape for you. OK, great. Lately I've been listening to some French stuff. Great. Put it on a mini-disc. I don't have one. I wonder if my cassette-player still works... Make it work! Oh, sure. Kayako... I'm calling those guys about that party.Want to come? Well... I'm supposed to call about 5. Can you hang out till then? OK? You OK? Yeah. I feel better. What do you think of that guy Mizuuchi? Him? I think he's cool. Yeah? I like guys like that. But I'm glad you came. I didn't think you would. No, l wanted to come. You hang out with Endo so much now... What? Let's lose these guys. OK? The next corner... I shouldn't run when I'm drunk. Can you believe a girl getting drunk like that? Lt's just not cool. Don't you think? Unbelievable, huh. Why did you keep glaring at me like that? I wasn't. She talks! I was beginning to think you couldn't. You're not a virgin, are you? How was the party? I'm exhausted. So's Watanabe, l hear. She got a bit drunk. She says she doesn't remember. Wow! So you can drink? Not that much. Come drinking with me, then. Ice cream's fine. Oh, yeah... Nakano said she saw you this morning and called to you... ...and you gave her a dirty look. I don't think she meant it though. Did I? I've never seen you give anyone a dirty look. Those Cezannes are good, aren't they? Yeah. I like table-tops better than mountains. Still-lifes? So do I. But if you like it, it must be good. I know! I've got a dress l don't wear. Do you want it? I bought it last year, but it's too cute for me. But not for me? Well, yeah. I think it'd suit you. Stand up for a minute. It comes down to about here. I can get Sumi to adjust it. Let's do that. What are you doing after high school? When we graduate? I haven't thought about it. How about you? I haven't, either. I told the teacher i'd go to a college around here. I haven't said anything. I haven't the faintest idea. A local college is the easiest thing to do. And my parents would like that. Do you worry about them? Not so much "worry". l don't want to cause them any trouble. What? What is it? Lt's just... ...l feel like you'll be going a long way away. What do you mean? I'll be right here. Yeah, but... Why don't we go to the same place? That's an idea... Let's do that. And take what? I'm no good at English. Who cares, as long as it's the same college? I do. You're hopeless! I know. Why don't you spend a night at my place when the term ends? My parents go away a lot. Bring underwear. Why? 'Cause I'm not lending you panties! Kayako... ...did you go to a hotel with Mizuuchi? Huh? One of the guys said so. Is it true? When l told you l liked him you didn't say anything. I think that's awful! It's low! Lt's sleazy! Let's get off. Sometimes l hang out here on my way home. After school l don't want to go home... ...but there's nowhere to go. I want a cigarette. That was really something! Just like a soap opera. Anyway, who cares? If you like a guy, what are you going to do? I don't like him. Then why did you go with him? That's weird. Did something happen? Lt's just... ...that I... ...like you. Kirishima! Does that mean what I think it does? Then I'm glad. Are you crying again? I mean it. Endo... Yeah? ...do you like being with me? Yes, l do. Why do you ask? I don't know. I like it. I'm happy. You're the one who came... ...and found me. I ate too much! I'm stuffed. We made too much. But we ate it. You can cook. You use everything in the fridge. I cook at home. You live with your mom? And my younger brother. So l do housework, too. You cook every day? No. We buy a lot of meals at the convenience store. But Mom makes my school lunch. I leave first, but she gets up, makes my lunch and goes back to bed. Wow! I don't know why. Maybe she feels guilty about having to work. I don't know why she should, though. You know what l want? l want to get away from here. You do? Yeah. Somewhere far away. I know l talked about college here... ...but l want to go away. Tokyo or somewhere. Lt scares me, though. Anywhere but here. But there's nothing l really want to do. I don't amount to anything. And it scares me to think of leaving when I'm like that. I don't believe that you don't amount to anything. You know all kinds of things, music I've never heard of... ...and books and things. l really admire you. I just know some stuff. You think so? I'd be you if l could. Why? How boring! You'd be disappointed. Yeah? ...ever been in an ambulance? Have I what? Yes. Was that why you were suspended? Yes, it was. So you knew about that? I see. I had... ...an abortion. In Grade 11. I didn't tell anyone... ...but the next day at school I felt bad. I bled all over the nurse's office. They called an ambulance, and everybody found out. People know about me being suspended... ...but not many know about the ambulance. They didn't use the siren. I'm surprised you knew. Does it hurt? An abortion? You get an anesthetic. But once it's over... ...you get morning sickness... ...then you feel like you're all cleaned out. I didn't like that feeling. You still want to be with me? Yes. You're weird. How are you? I'm sorry. l guess we got carried away. I'm fine if l lay down. Are you catching cold? Do you have a fever? Lt's nothing. I'm worried. Lt's not your fault. I'm sorry. Oh, Kirishima... Did l wake you? Sorry. I wasn't sleeping. They said you were here. Thanks for coming. Kirishima... ...could you leave me alone with Nakano for a bit? OK. See you. Endo's away, huh... And it's the last day of term. Is she sick a lot? This might sound strange... ...we can't divide up the bean-pancake money. When there were four of us, it divided evenly. When Endo came we were five, and that was still all right. But without you two, it doesn't work. I'm not complaining. lt's just something that always strikes me. Oh, Mom! Summer vacation starts today! Kirishima! It's so hot! Grade 12s don't have to come to practice, but l was worried. Must be tough. I should leave it to the Grade 11s. Was her mother worried? Maybe. She was talking so fast l couldn't really understand her. Endo's gone off to see a guy. A guy? Yeah. Her old boyfriend. You didn't know about him? The abortion... Oh, so you know. Only that she got suspended from school. She was seeing a married man. A year ago last spring we went out on a class drinking party. She got sick and threw up in the mall... ...right on this guy's clothes. We all freaked. We apologized like mad. He put his finger down her throat to help her bring everything up. We thought he was a nice guy. I didn't know, but Endo got his name card. She called him up and went out with him. But he was married! She didn't know that at the time. In the end, she got pregnant, didn't tell him, and had the abortion. Then everyone found out. Her parents went to yell at the guy... ...and when they got there, his wife was pregnant, too. Isn't that awful? I thought Endo was over it. l was starting to relax. You know all those foreign CDs she has? That's the kind of music he likes. Why did she go to see him? Didn't you know? He called her. One night the phone rang. Whoever it was hung up, but she guessed it was him and called back. I guess the baby was stillborn... ...and he and his wife weren't getting along... ...and he got depressed and called Endo. Can you believe that? But it really shook Endo up. Nakano... ...when did you hear this? Before end of term, in the nurse's office. I know what you mean. l wonder why she went? She might not even come back, you know... I've got to go. Kirishima! How are you? What've you been up to? Your mother called. I didn't tell her l was going away. A souvenir. Grapes. They're really great. Thanks. Your mother was worried. Yeah. Some friends wanted to go. l didn't want the hassle of telling her... ...so l just went. Where? To the sea, to the mountains... lots of places. Who with? Friends from middle school. Who? You wouldn't know them. Was it fun? Not much. I wanted to see you. Endo... ...why are you lying to me? What? I'm not lying. Kayako, there's grapes in here. I know. They'll rot here. Bring me some tea. Eat them. You have them. Yes? Could l speak to you? We're still on vacation, you know. Well... come in. Would you look at a painting? You are...? Kirishima. 12C. The drawing's lousy, but the colors are very good. Right here... lt's not bad. Did you do that this summer? Yes. Lt's my first painting. Yeah? I'd like to try and get into an arts university. You're in Grade 12? Yes. You're kind of late. People who start sketching in Grade 10 don't even make it. - A state school? - No. Anyway come in from tomorrow and practice drawing. Yes, sir. Here you are... The ceremony's starting... You're not very tanned, are you. Didn't you go anywhere? You called me. Why don't you say something? Look, I've forgotten about it, too. If you don't want anything... I do. Well? My friend didn't tell me something very important. I'm really upset about it. l wonder why... What is this? A quiz show? Ls this a joke? Are you in love... ...with this "friend"? Yes. - How much? - A lot. - And the friend? - I don't know. That means you're the one who's most in love. You're sad because you're not getting back what you're giving... ...or something. I'm going. I'll walk with you. No. Come on! Hey... Yeah? ...why did you pick me? Why did you invite me to that hotel? Do you ever talk about anything besides "me"? Why did you go with me, then? You said you're in love. I wanted to get close. To what? I don't know. We could find a hotel... No, thanks. I heard you'd taken up painting... l guess it's true. I want to talk to you. I know all about it. Endo, you're horrible! I know. I'm a horrible person. So I'm not surprised that you hate me. I don't hate you. You don't care if I'm not around. Why are you crying? I painted a picture this summer. Grapes. A still-life. I was alone all summer. I had nothing to do. Are you hungry? You're broke? I wanted to take you to my grandmother's in the summer. My parents are divorced. She's my dad's mother, but me and my brother... ...have still always gone there. Lt's way out in the country. They used to have cows. Lt's like a ranch. lt's really nice. I wanted to take you there. You sure talk a lot. But if I don't... If I don't talk... ...I'll just get mad at you again. The sea's amazing, huh... Most of it. That you'd gone to see him. He said he needed help. Not in so many words... ...but I could hear it. I couldn't tell you... ...that he meant more to me than you. He said he wanted to start over... ...in Tokyo, with me. And l got my hopes up. But l didn't go. You were here. No. You wouldn't have gone whether I was here or not... ...because... ...l always come second. You broke up with him, so the number-one slot is vacant. When someone else comes, you'll put him there. But you'll always be the one I love the most. They'll be worried about us. Probably. Should we phone? No. Here. Lt's good. Yeah. Endo... ...let's go to Tokyo. We'll go to school there. And live together? Sure. Will we cook, fight to see who goes in the bath first... ...and both sleep in? And when one of us goes out, or when we go to sleep... ...instead of "goodbye" we'll say "see you later" and "good night". Like a real couple. We are a real couple. But l can't go. Your parents? That's part of it. I don't amount to anything. Suddenly you've found what you want to do... ...but not me. I just go with the flow. Those art books didn't make me want to paint. But you started painting. If there's something you want to do, you go and do it. You're strong. I'd like to be that way. You do amount to something. You're Endo, just the way you are. The first bus! We could get on that and go to school. Let's go. After I went to Tokyo, a letter arrived from Endo. "This is all I can do," she wrote. She'd sent a video-tape. I watched that tape over and over again.
