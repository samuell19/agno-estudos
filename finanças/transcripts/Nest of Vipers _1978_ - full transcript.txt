"NEST OF VIPERS" Good. The tempo was all right Richter, can't you ever pay attention? That's all for now. Till this afternoon. Hello... excuse me... - I'm Mattia Morandi. - Morandi...? Ah, Morandi... Piano scholarship. - From Lecco, right? - Yes. It's late. We'll talk this afternoon. You the new one on piano? Renato Richter. Welcome. - I'm Mattia Morandi. - Let's study this stuff... Why did you come to Venice? My mother was born here. She wanted to return. She died before I won the grant. I took it. I can live on it. - My family wasn't rich. - Nor mine. We're not from Venice either, but from Trieste. We've been all over: Venice, Berlin... My father left us nothing. I was small... My mother had to work I learned languages but forgot them - My father died when I was 2. - Strange. - Why? - Odd coincidence. My father was unbearable. It was a relief... Wait. What a rush. I'm late. As usual. You know me by now. So many things to do... This is Mattia Morandi. He's new on my course. This is Carla. My mother. Your mother? Sure! Find it strange? No, but... I thought a friend... a sister... I had him at seventeen. Add it up. A youthful error. Would you say? But not a bad one. The usual nonsense... Come on, let's go. - Goodbye, Mattia. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mattia. - Bye. Well, are you coming? No, I don't want to. Hello? Wait! Excuse me... The door was open... - Don't tell me you're shy. - No... no. You've been shopping? Me? No. It's for you. Carla sent it. I don't know what it is. I'm just the delivery boy. A blanket in this heat? Carla's always practical. She's already thinking of winter. - Do you like sweets? - Yes. Look, I can't accept these gifts from your mother. Christ! Call her Carla! She says "mother" makes her old. "Mama" too, even more. - Have you read it? - Not yet. I've heard it's very good. You see. Carla's thinking even of your culture. I'm going. We expect you for lunch tomorrow. And don't say you're busy. It's Sunday. - Bye. - Bye. Unfortunately I can't have servants... It used to be different... Once we had three. She's exaggerating again... Excuse me. When we had servants? Liar! We had and you remember perfectly. Sometimes I think Renato's ashamed of us. It's wrong. The Richter's were rich. Respected. Among the best of Trieste. Then as often happens... they was left with little money. This palace is all we have left. We sold the rest. And moved into these four rooms... ...with a certain decorum. Our relatives are ship-owners, millionaires. And Carla... would like to milk them... What will your friend think? I wanted to study painting. More than music. But Carla won't hear of it. You know you two are colleagues? - She teaches piano. - At the Conservatory? No! She teaches fools to move their fingers so they can play the national anthem. Here I am! Your coffee. Excuse me... - Hello. - Madam, good day... I asked you to wait... They haven't paid me yet. - Only to the end of the month. - Please, I beg you. - Then I'll sue and you'll be evicted. - Yes, yes... - Yes, yes, yes... - Remember that. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Who was it? - No one important. I'm always asking him to draw me. But he always has an excuse. I think Renato has a crush on you. Sugar? One thanks. Your coffee is there, honey. I'll leave you. You and your mother talk oddly. Quiet, I'm doing the mouth. Why oddly? I wouldn't talk to mine like that. Carla's also a friend. - And a woman too. - I know, but she's still your mother. Then what do you mean? I know people who hear us are shocked. But we don't care. Of course they're shocked. There are traditions to be respected. Morality... That's how it is, so there You look sad today. You make me sad too. Come. I'll show you something. Elena, I'll fall, don't run. You suggested it to me. I did it without telling mother. You like it? It's beautiful. I'm glad you listened to me. I'll put in on. You can tell me what goes with it. You don't realize how lucky you are. Why? You've had everything from life. I, instead... ...had no youth... ...as you do now. At your age I had a child. These buttons... Help me. My son changed my life, you know. Am I boring? Do you mind? Of course not... No more sadness. You're a beautiful young... Enjoy this moment while... Well, good! You had your way. Let me see. It's lovely. It suits you too. But there's something wrong. It's not elegant... It's my fault. I advised her. How are you, Mrs. Richter? - Quite well, thank... - No need to worry. How are the lessons going? - I think that... - I see... I didn't know you also taught fashion. Good day. Bye, dear, see you later at the Lido. Don't mind her, my mother's strange. It doesn't matter, don't worry. I was sure you'd be working. Don't you ever go with women? - Don't worry... - But I do. And I'm curious, because I'm your friend. By the way. Ever been to bed with an older woman? Older? I mean a woman. Not a girl... for example, someone... ...Carla's age. Don't talk like that! How boring you are. Can't even joke with you. So he found himself in an odd situation. Know something, Carla? - Mattia doesn't like women. - What's that? Don't be shocked, let me finish. He likes young girls, not women, so... that's excluding you. I find that very proper. But tell me something. Do I seem old to you? Why no! He says stupid things. I know. You needn't justify yourself. I forgive you. As long as you don't call me Mrs. Call me Clara. The nation pays homage to the fidelity of our heroic people... Once again... the courage... Are you ever uncomfortable with us? No, but why do you... ...say that? You ask me? I'm not stupid, you know. I know you. Make a face. I'd like to provoke you even more. You see? Didn't I tell you? Let's sit here. So many people. Look, there are the Mazzarinis. Very rich and important. The daughter is my student. A beautiful woman should not disturb herself for a man. Count and Countess Grimani! Mr. and Mrs. Carteri... Don't trouble yourselves, we'll meet later at the Prefecture. This is a great moment for Italy. You think so. Yes everybody says so... - However... - However However, it's Saturday and no lessons. Why don't we go see Linda? Linda is Carla's cousin. One of our famous rich relatives. The only nice one. Mattia Morandi. A chum of Renato's. - Glad to meet you. - I too, dear. Leave the bags and kiss me. - Hi, cousin. - Hello to you. Carla, you're in the usual room. And you two will sleep together. I hope you don't mind. - For me it's fine. But Mattia... - It's fine for me too. How marvellous! I've never seen so much fish. They made an extraordinary catch. I know how you and your son like food... Eat. Linda, stop! We're eating too much! You want me to burst! You haven't tasted these. And taste this. Won't get them in Lecco. What is it? Eat and say nothing! But... it's alive... Sure it's alive. That's why it's good. Decide. Well? - Like it? - Yes... it's good... You can see he's disgusted. Your friends seems... ...a nice boy. And handsome too. And also... well mannered. I've always brought nice people here. Tell that to somebody else! It's good to see people eat with appetite. But don't eat too much shellfish... Tonight you'll toss about and I'll be there... Don't you fell well? I was thirsty. I can't sleep either. In this heat... Some nights I can't sleep 'till dawn... It's awful. To have so many hours to think... Especially at night... Maybe I'm getting old. No. You're beautiful... Really? I'm glad you came. It's already dark! It's very late. I must go. Renato will be worried. What can I tell him? I'll have to think of something... - A little longer. - I can't. I must run... Try to understand. - You'll come tomorrow? - Soon. - Bye... - Bye. - You saw Carla yesterday? - Your mother? No, why? Don't play the fool. I realized it the first time. At Linda's... - She told you? - Hardly. I saw it in her eyes. Happiness. Now we've talked don't be embarrassed. You make her happy. ...so I like you even more. Mattia! I made you wait. Excuse me... Hello. You'll eat with us? I'm busy. Work, important... I see. You gave them to Mattia? No. I waited... for you to be here too. The keys to the house... Use them any time... If you like... You're part of the family. Bye Mattia. See you soon. - Good, Andrea, well done! - You're good. It's thanks to her. I owe you your pay. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. Goodbye and thanks again. Goodbye madam. My love... We've been here so long. We're mad! I had my lessons... You make me forget. You know? I love you... Oh, my love... I have feelings... that I'd forgotten. I forget everything. Even Renato... And he... ...asks questions, he's nervous... He checks up on me. Continually. - The jealous husband? - No. Even sons... can be jealous. Come here. Your look embarrasses me. - I'm not beautiful. - You are. Very beautiful. Really? Caress me... Caress me... I love your hands, my darling. But if I swear it why insist? I left early because I had lessons. - Enough of your lies! - Be calm... - You're lying! - You've never been so upset. I didn't see him today. No! It's not true, liar! You saw him today! And yesterday! You go everyday! - It's not true! Not at all! - Then look at me. We don't tell each other things any more. Why? Because you fell in love! - No! I swear it! - You lie! Look at me... You love him more than you do me. Nonsense, calm down. You're my son. He takes all your love. Even what belongs to me. Excuse me, mama... Renato, don't do that. Stop, dear. You're not a child but I don't want you to suffer. You're all-important to me. I can't lose you. Why say that? What's in your mind? Even if I liked him, he means nothing. Only you count for me. Let's do this: not see him any more. I don't want to any more. I promise you... and I'm tired of him He's a fool. A boring fool... All right? All right, dearest? My treasure... Better? My little boy... - What was that? - I don't know. You come too, I'm afraid. How are you? Fine. And you? So, so... Can I come in? Or not? Come in. Haven't seen you in ages. It's your portrait, done from memory. I've acted badly. Forget it! Can I explain... I said to forget it. Thanks for your drawing. I came... ...because I wanted to see you. We missed you. What do you mean? Yes... We wondered about you. Besides I wanted to invite you to dinner Carla's asked the Mazzarinis. Those millionaires... Remember? Yes. I remember. Well... coming? Elena! She didn't know you were coming. Nice surprise, hmm? Come in. You've changed a lot. The waiter's rented. Carla sold her last jewel... for this dinner and the d?cor. Didn't you? Because she hopes it'll bring us... ...half the Mazzarini wealth... ...meaning I'll marry Elena. He never stops teasing me... even when I think of his future. How are you? But Carla... - A vermouth? Good? - Fine. Straight? The Mazzarinis! Welcome! - Good evening! - Hello Elena, Hello Edoardo. Let me introduce... ...Mattia Morandi, a friend. ...and my son Renato. The famous Renato! Finally! Your mother's talked a lot about you. Yes, a lot. Carla talks too much. You shouldn't speak of me, but of music. - You call your mother by name? - An old family habit. Beautiful, isn't she? Something to drink? - I'll do it. - No, the waiter will. Carla speaks only of your beauty... ...but we don't know what's behind it. Tell us, would you? My beauty? If you want. Well, I study many things... Embroidery Piano Classical and modern ballet. And? A nursing course. - Interesting. - Not at all. My mother's idea. She says war coming. So I'll have to be a nurse... like all good girls. Satisfied? I am, and you? What will you do after all that? Probably marry a man my parents choose... ...who I won't love... ...who'll protect me... ...and who'll father my children. You like that too? A perfect picture. Don't think I'll do it all. My mother wanted me to go to cooking school. Amusing. I hate cooking! You were right, I can't boil an egg. But you're a man. Edoardo, you? I want to be a... photo reporter. Travel the world. But... it's a little problem. My father's against it. Why? He says it's not serious. Good night Elena... Good night Edoardo... It's late, I'll go too. We'll go too, Renato. Get some air, it's so hot. - We'll walk them home, all right? - Why not? But then we lost touch. They were 2 characters, no? My cousin knew them too. I recall their wedding. A splendid ceremony. The husband was a professional gambler. A cheat. She was deeply in love. He had to have something. We're home. Come to the movies Saturday afternoon? Hurry, mama's waiting. Three thirty tomorrow, St. Angelo pier. Thank you and good night... Good night, Edoardo. You two want to talk? I'm going... ...I hate climaxes. No one's laughing. No sense of humour. Bye... I missed you. I forced myself not to come to you. I wanted you so much... ...and to explain. It doesn't matter, love... ...I'll say no more... ...not a word, dearest. You want me? Say it? Come here... No, people pass by. Doesn't matter. I need you. My love, take me, do. - Shall we go? - Let's see it again. It's late. Good evening Morandi... Let's sit there. If you're not busy... will you dine with us? I, don't know... Dressed like this... We're not formal... We're not the Richters. Good night, miss. - Good night. - Good night. - Your parents? - Don't worry. You like it? Venice is full of amazing palaces. Listed, Edoardo. I have no quarrel with art. Your friend wants to be a pianist, fine! It's a real art: concerts, recordings... But this idea of photography... What kind of art is that? But he obeyed you, he started university. Let him try! Photo reporter? Does that sound like ambitious work? Without a degree! It's ridiculous. I can understand a studio for artistic portraits... ...but to roam the world. It's dangerous too! With wars all over, you know? Absurd. Then I should avoid cars, you die in them too... ...you know? I say Edoardo is right. It's useless, dear, young people are always allies. Let them play... at little rebels. - Very good. - Bravo, bravo Mattia. Elena, did you hear how he plays? But I won't do concerts. Elena's right. Sit here, Mattia. Do you think Mrs. Richter is a good teacher? Yes, very... I'm glad. I think Elena is making real progress with her. - Right, darling? - Yes, mama. Heavens! The curtains! A hurricane! Been raining 2 months, bad for crops. Wine will be bad, like last year. An impossible summer. Why don't they light candles? There we are... Finally! The dark scares me. Elena, don't be a baby. Light those and don't drop wax on the carpets. How will Mattia get home? I don't know... We'll send him in the motorboat. See if Vittorio is still awake. It's all right even if I get a bit wet. A bit? Don't you live outside the city? Yes, but it'll stop. Can't you hear? It's a hurricane. Father, can't he stay here tonight? Right... actually I... What do you say? Sorry, Morandi, I haven't thought... Mariuccia, prepare the guest room. Don't worry, we'll do it. Let's go, Edoardo. Good night, Morandi... Glad to have met you. Till tomorrow. - Good night, Edoardo. - Good night. Good night. He seems serious, he plays well. Yes, but he's shy. Elena, look who I brought you... Surprised? A bit. Yes. Is it a bad surprise? No. Edoardo, play a record. Here we are. Nice, what is it? "I'm in the mood for love" - What? - "I'm in the mood for love" We bought it in New York. - You've been to America? - Sure. - How was it? - Extraordinary. A fantastic country! Dance? Go on, or she'll ask me and I don't want to. Hey, whoa, smoochers! You're going too far. Give her a goodnight kiss... ...and we'll go to sleep. Goodnight Elena. Night, little sister... We looked for you. Renato went to your house. We thought something had happened to you. You weren't home. With that rain I couldn't leave. They kept me here. We expected you for dinner. Did you forget? Sorry. - You didn't care to see me... - Why say that? Let's not talk here. - I'll come to you. Agreed? - This afternoon? All right. Be careful here. Don't rush it. Watch me. All right? Where's your mind? Bored? Shall we stop? Yes, maybe. I can't stay here. I want to go outside... I understand. It's a beautiful day, so clear... On my way here I met Mattia. Yes... He slept here. He couldn't go out because of the rain last night. The rain... You were kind to have him stay. The lesson's finished? Elena didn't feel like it. Can you walk with me? We can talk. You played tennis? I played as a girl. I didn't move, I did nothing to stop him. German girls are different. Ask your husband. Excellency, you're terrible. This is nothing. You should have met me 10 years ago! Mama, you're the most beautiful. What do you think of Mussolini's mistress? If you don't mind, Countess, I'd rather not say. Although I've met her. Can Mattia stay on with us? Sure. By now he's family. Good night and many thanks. When can I go too? When the time comes, miss. Rewind it, play it again. But we've played it thousands of times. - I like it. - I'll do it. I saw Mrs. Richter yesterday. Oh, yes? What did you do to her? Nothing. Why? She says... ...nasty things about you. Like what? ...unpleasant hints... Don't be foolish. One can guess. Poor woman... She wanted me to marry her son. She even told me. But I don't like him. So sleepy... Aren't you two sleepy? I get it... Mattia, another 5 minutes then go home. - Got it? - All right. It's 5 o'clock. I must go. I don't want to be seen. My love... Wait. I'll see you out. Come... Quick! - Hello. - Hello. Hello. How are you, dear? Yes, don't worry. I'll surely be in Rome next week. I'll speak with his Excellency personally, don't worry. - Why all this affection? - Just... like that... And last night? You came in late. Was it fun? A nice ball, lots of people... Too many. And they all spoke only of the war. Saying it'll come soon. She's obsessed with war. She even sees it at dances. No lessons today. Why? It's a lovely day. I want to go out. Why don't you give us the car? We'll go to the villa. We never go. I don't know. Ask your father. Father, say yes! If your mother doesn't object... Then it's yes! Edoardo, phone down to prepare the car. She never closes doors... But she cheers up the house. She's still such a child. Listen, Amalia... Avoid talking so much of war. It implies excessive alarmism... given our position. But it's not just my idea. Also the other day at the Levis. But their position's different; they're Jews. - I know. But their arguments made sense. - Maybe... But listen, Amalia, please. Speak less of it. Look there! Crab apples! Quick. Come. - Where? - You'll see... Where are you? You know the way. I don't. Like it? - Let's go to the starting point. - OK, let's go. We'll race. This is the starting point. That's the finish line. Look who's here! How did he get here? Well! You forgot about today's lesson. No. I didn't forget. I didn't feel like it. Excuse me. Your mother told me. She said you were here. And to join you. - Hello, Edoardo. - Hello. - Hello, Mattia. - Hello. We won't spoil your game. Can we join in? Of course. Also because I'm sure to win. Then I'll go with you. I too want to win. Each takes a different way. The finish line is there. Wait. I must tell you something. Yes but hurry. You know you're a real bastard? - Why? - You act like a cad. You don't need us now. So you treat us like... ...worn-out shoes. It's not for me. I know you immediately in spite of your charm. In fact I don't care. You can't do it to Carla! Do what? Humiliate her. The other day she went to you but you didn't answer. - I wasn't home. - You were so. You listen to me, Renato. For the last time. Maybe you're right but I tried to show her. I love Elena. It's true! So don't bother me any more! Instead of being mad... look up there. Carla won... you see? Be careful. Women don't give up easily. It doesn't concern me. I won't talk about it. Not concern you. How can that be? It concerns your whole family. How you can think... Mattia is sincere. I really can't believe. Why not? Because he's my lover. Why did you go without me? - You spoke with Renato. - I didn't talk to anyone. We were racing, no? What a strange perfume. - Did you care that much? - Yes. And I won! I like to win. You mustn't be alone with Carla. Edoardo! A turtle. What did she tell you? You really want to know? Yes. I told her I'm in love with you. You irritated my face. Does it show? Yes. Let's hope mama doesn't notice. What a hard beard! Elena... Did you like that? Elena... Did you? Of course I did. Satisfied? They're over there. Talking. But you know what you're doing? - I told you... - Sure. Even after what Mrs. Richter said? I'm aware of the economic problems. Now, unfortunately... My career is just starting. Let's not talk of money. If we were newly-rich we'd want a big name. But we can afford to give her a husband who pleases her and us. You're an artist. But serious. We like this in you. Seriousness. Italy is in the vanguard of Europe. You know that, but above all... you really love Elena. The rest is gossip. But you're both very young, kids... I say only one thing... Wait two or three years to marry. All right? Until then... ...you'll be like a son of us. Thank you. Let's go, young man. To Elena. Well done. - So you've decided. - Yes. But you're so young... At your age I did everything wrong. In youthfulness... ...you only follow feelings... ...deluded by the myth of ideal love. Only to discover that all that counts is... ...is physical love. You don't mind if I talk like this? Not at all. I'm pleased. We're friends and can speak in confidence. As women... Tell me... Have you two gone to bed? No! Never! Didn't you want to? Not even... ...when he kisses you, holds you. Well... sure... But we're not married yet... You're really a good girl! I hope you'll be very happy. Here, look what it says about you. Read it out loud. "A person long fond of your family... " "... warns you that an undesirable individual... " "... is corrupting your children" "He has lived in dubious intimacy with a male friend... " "and with notoriously immoral women" We don't believe any of this. It lacks only Mrs. Richter's signature. You think she wrote... ...this letter? I know it. For what reason? Yes...? I can't now. I think I've been clear. They've gone too far. It's their problem. Goodbye. Did you want me? You are here. - What happened? - Something unpleasant. Don't worry. He's not involved. Dear, for serious reasons which Mattia has told us... ...the piano lessons stop as of today. I don't see... what she's done so wrong. She wrote an anonymous letter to slander Mattia... ...and offend us. If it's anonymous why say she wrote it? Mattia is sure. - Is it true. - Yes, it is. You must believe me. Good day. Excuse me, madam, I was told to give you this. "Consider Elena's lessons suspended as of today" "I include the money owed you" - Mrs. Mazzarini in? - I don't know. I don't think... Go look for her. Tell her I must see her now. - But what... - I must talk to you. I can't here. There are things I must know. Come to me tomorrow afternoon. I'll expect you. Mrs. Mazzarini is unable to receive you. She says if it's for the money, speak with the administrator. Mattia! You're crazy! - You'll destroy me. - Come in. No, we'll speak here. Such a dirty, disgusting thing. I'd never have expected it... even from you. You were wrong. I'll do anything! You drove me to it. It was you! Me! You've been a cad! You've ruined everything! Did you hope... I'd leave Elena? Not a chance! Are you sure she loves you? That's enough! Besides... We shouldn't argue like this... ...So much has happened... ...and after all... ...I met Elena here. But don't worry. I won't forget you or Renato. What do you mean? Nothing... That I'll pay you back... I'll give you money. My God! I ask myself how I can... ...still love you. You're a squalid... ...little social climber who thinks only of money! And you? You wanted Renato to marry Elena. For money, no? I would never have left you. Never. Never! I wrote that letter. But you saw? It's as though I signed it. I wrote it because it was the only way... ...to see you again. To make you... come back... to me. This too is love. Don't you see, Mattia? Once more... The last, if you like. - No! - No... Wait... stay... No, a little longer... my love... Goodbye Carla. Here I am. I wish I'd never written it. A horrible thing... that shames me. I had to... defend... myself. Defend? From who? I saw you all... against me. First I saw you as a family... almost mine. Then you abandoned me. I'm alone. Who can I ask to forgive me? No one. You're good. You understand me. Whenever... I had something I treasured... it's been taken from me. It's a moment of weakness, don't be child. You and Mattia have also abandoned me. But I'm still fond of you. I beg you, don't reject me... I need to be consoled. Now you do it... like that... Yes... like that... - Now you'll leave Mattia. - Mattia? Why? Mattia is my fianc?. Was. Now you won't marry him. Why? We can meet secretly. - You haven't understood. - What? No more marriage with Mattia! - Is that clear? - What? You're mad! I'm marrying Mattia, for sure. No. I'll tell your parents what we did. Everyone! You disgust me! I didn't when we made love. You know why I did it? It was the only way I could... stop your marrying him. They'd believe you? Never, never! Yes they will! The word will spread. It's easy in a city like this. And you'll be ruined, your parents too... who believe their little girl is so pure! And you hope to get Mattia back after this? You're mad, mad! You're involved too! Maybe, yes, I am. But I have nothing left to lose. But you won't have him either. That's enough. Now go, you're boring me. We could go to Salzburg. Those beautiful lakes nearby. And Mattia could hear fine music. How nice to travel all together. You need a real vacation. You're right. The last was a trip to America. Excuse me. The commissioner is here. Excuse me. What is it? Oh, the usual apple thief. Last year too, a tragedy for a few apples. Went to jail, poor fellow. Bad news. Shocking. Mrs. Richter is dead. Perhaps murdered. Commissioner Franchetti is here. Darling, don't cry, please. Franchetti is a friend. He wants to see you, Elena. Don't cry. Out of friendship for your family... I came myself. A pure formality... But inevitable. We understand... Tell me... when did you last see Mrs. Richter? The other day. To think she was fired only yesterday. Commissioner... was it definitely murder? Maybe she had problems. No, madam. A crushed skull is not suicide. Besides, the weapon was by the body. A small bronze statue, with fingerprints wiped off. You understand... Of course, excuse me... The victim's son, who found the body... while upset, mentioned names... rather... one in particular. Someone in a sense... part of your family. Mattia Morandi. What? Mattia... He's my daughter's fianc?. I know! Mr. Morandi I must ask some personal questions. If you like we can talk privately. I have nothing to hide. All right. Were you Mrs. Richter's lover? Yes. When did that stop? When I met Elena. How did Mrs. Richter take the end... of your... friendship? She wouldn't accept it. She didn't understand that it was only... - ... you know... - Yes, yes. Tell me... She tried to prevent your engagement? To blackmail you... with letters perhaps? If you already know, why ask me? If you have something else... All right. Where were you... yesterday afternoon... between three and six? Home studying. Alone? Yes. The victim's son... says that you... Tell him, Mattia, tell him! Mama, papa... I'm sorry to hurt you... ...but I must. Yesterday between three and six I was with Mattia... in his room. Say nothing. Miss Mazzarini... Can you repeat under oath... even in court... what you've said? Of course. When and where you like. All right. Listen Franchetti... I would like not one word of this to be known. - You understand? - Naturally. Your daughter's word is enough. We've been told that Mrs. Richter's character was questionable. She was probably killed by a casual lover. Very likely... We weren't prudent, allowing her near our children... without investigating her. And your son? Fine, thank you... He's graduated. He's looking for work. Send him to me. I'll do something for him. Thank you. Goodbye Franchetti. Goodbye. "The Earth and all in it belongs to God" Subtitles extracted by DeMille.
