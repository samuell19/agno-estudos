Love is patient, Love is kind It does not envy, It does not boast It is not proud, It is not rude It is not self seeking It is not easily angered It keeps no record of wrongs Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth It always protects, always trusts Always hopes, Always perseveres Love never fails. Hehe..That'd be just like you to fall down the stairs It is so hot. Aww poor baby.....yeah..... Ya know...I love church and I love Pastor Jenkin's sermons but I gotta say...when he gets to going and gets that second wind in him I gotta wonder if he's ever gonna shut up. Ain't that the truth. I thought for sure Sunday morning was gonna roll into Sunday evening. He certainly is a passionate man. Ya know who else is a passionnate man? Ummm...hmmm......Come on Could it be...the President? No. Hmm...the Pope? .......unh uh My 8th grade math teacher. No...I am, silly. Honey, you ok? Seems like you've been sick for at least a week. Yeah, I'll be alright Comes and goes. Prolly just got a bug or something. Shoot, you ain't pregnant, are ya? Don't even joke about that. Ah, heavens...at my age? Wouldn't that just be a kicker? Imagine us as parents. How weird would that be after all this time of being by ourselves? Honey, we're too old to be chasing some toddler around. Heck, I get outta breath just going up the stairs sometimes. I'm gonna need somebody to take care of me in a couple of years and probably put diapers on me too. Don't worry Virginia, I will always be here to take care of you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I thank the good Lord everyday for sending me such a wonderful angel. And I'll change your poopy diapers. Aw Rick, you say the sweetest things Honey, I love you. And I love you...with all my heart. Babies really like this? Yes, they do...they love the sound. How do we know that for sure? Mother's intuition Just trust me. Alright...but...how about this? A pink bear? What if it's a boy? Maybe It don't wanna play with no pink bear. Well...if He is a boy then He can decide what he likes or doesn't like. and we can adjust accordingly. What did I ever do to deserve such an amazing wonderful woman? Well, you know God works in mysterious ways So you just got lucky, buster. I certainaly did. I've been so faitgued for like the last 4 months. Yeah, I'm gaining weight for sure but I'm watching it too I've only gained maybe 25 lbs but I sure can feel the weight of this baby. Feels like my belly could just pop. Uh...h-hey...I gotta call ya back. Rick...help me Virginia! Honey, what happened? Honey Oh my God, Virginia Look at all the blood. Oh, we gotta get you to a hospital. I'm gonna go call 911 Oh dear sweet God please save my wife. She is my all She's my love my best friend...she is my life. I need her to survive. I can't face this world alone. Please God...please I beg you Just keep her and the baby both okay Doc...is she okay? Was looking for you. Is she okay? Mr. Sims, I'm sorry. We did everything within our power Oooooh....no. Oh God. To carry out a pregnacy at full term, at her age comes at great risks. She had hypertension and eclampsia. Mr. Sims, your daughter is alive and well. She's doing fine. The nurses are prepping a room so you can see her soon. Again, I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Sims. My loss...my Virginia Is this a test, God? You took my Virginia. Why? We are gathered here today to mourn the loss of our beloved Virginia. And while we mourn her death, we need to also celebrate her life. Her life was full of love, passion, and faith. Virginia was a good Christian Always at church every Sunday And was very supportive wife to her husband, Rick. She was always there in times of love, and in times of pain. Now it's our time to support our good friend, Rick. As we celebrate this life that was taken so prematurely I want ya to think of what a friend we have in Jesus. Let us pray Almighty God, fountain of life, you are our refuge, you are our strength please enable us to put our trust in you our faith...and help us find grace in this time of need. Through Jesus Christ, in his name, we pray Amen. You know you're my bud. Whatever you need, you just ask. I'm here for you always, my friend. Always. I know...thank you bro, always being there, man. God bless you...God Bless you. Thank you. I love you. Sorry for your loss, Rick. Thank you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Sorry, Rick. If you need anything, let me know. I will. Thank you....Take care. Just what are we going to do now, Miss Dalana? Your mother was the glue holding my fragile little world together. Man, if she could just see what a beautiful little baby you are. And I thank God for you and for the strength to carry on. I just laid your mama to rest. It's just you and me now, sweet Dalana. It's just you and me. "Say to those who are fearful hearted be strong...do not fear Behold, your God will come with vengence ...and it shall be called the highway of Holiness The unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road although a fool, shall not go astray. No lion shall be there nor shall any ravenous beast go upon it. It shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there. Hey ole buddy, how are you holding up? Well, good as can be expected, I reckon. You know, taking it day by day. Well, I hear ya. I know it's a devastating thing. Long recovery. At least you got this little bundle of joyright here to keep you compay. Oh man, what a cutie. Certain ways she looks reminds me so much of her mama. Well, I can see it for sure. Look, I know things look bleak right now. Hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel. But trust me, with faith and the strength you get from God, you'll persevere. Now here you are, an amazing father taking care of your beautiful daughter Now that's God new plan for you, Rick, ole buddy. You are a hunderd percent right. It is a hard adjustment for sure but the path of righteousness will not set me astray uhh umh So I can burrow down and commit myself to Jesus and know that with God's will I can overcome these obstacles before me. You will, you will. Now come on let's turn that frown upside down. What shall we do? Wanna play some cards? Haha I brought my lucky deck. Sure...I'm up for that. Just let me get a bottle for Dalana. Well, this time you're gonna get your butt kicked. Empty threats I've heard it all before. Honey, I just...found... Dalana, come here my child I will give you my daily Bible reading. Hmm...not right now, huh? Ok, we can wait til this evening if you'd rather. Virginia would be so proud of you, sweetie. Yep. I know she's in Heaven, smiling down on you and so pleased with how much meaning you have brought to this ole man. I miss you, Virginia. Everyday. I wish I could be with you but I - I know I'm needed here on this Earth. I promise I will keep our daughter safe from all the evils of this wicked world. That's right. Ain't that right? Oh Dalana, you so precious. What cha doing over there? Come on.......No Come here. What was that? Oh, you so precious. You think you are so much better than me. I can smell the self righteous stink on you. You think that I am a sinner and you are free of sin? Fuck you asshole. You're the one that's going to die alone and burn in Hell...burn...in...Hell Brothers and sisters, I want to talk today about something that's been heavy on my heart. Family. The state of the fundamental structure of today's society. Genesis 19:30-38 Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters. Then the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth come in to us after the manner of the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father." What this passage says to me is that we need to put the family first, focus on the family, and strengthen the family. Especially in these dark times. Before we can fix the outside, we need to mend from within. Keep your family close and make sure Jesus Christ is a member of that family. I tell ya, Pastor Jenkins' sermon sure does make ya think, don't it? Yeah well, Jesus said to love thy neighbor, he didn't say to love thy neighbor IF. True. But still, The pastor makes a good point about homosexuals putting an end to procreation. I don't know. That surely is a hard thing to fathom. That's cause it wasn't acceptable when you and I was growing up. We all just let it become the norm though All these young kids, all be wanting to get into same sex relationships. There won't be no boys wanting girlfriends, no girls wanting boyfriends. Hey, little squirt. Hey bigger squirt. Dad, can I play out in the woods? There's a pond out there and I wanna go see if there's any frogs in it. No, sweetie, there's no need for you to be playing out there in those woods. Besides, it'll be dark soon. You still have to do your chores and read the Bible before bed. But Daddy......No buts. You do as you're told, young lady. I never get to do anything fun. Sorry about that, She's getting to be that age. Teenager. Now, what were we talking about? What was I talking about? Oh! I was talking about no guys wanting girls and vice versa. The crazy dating game. Speaking of that though, before long you're gonna have to start beating the boys off with a stick with that one. Hehe What cha gonna do then, Rick? Whew...I don't know. I dread it, I tell ya. Ah, she's always been a good obedient little girl but these upcoming years I gotta say, I'm a little bit terrified. Yeah, I don't envy you, that's for sure. She's all you've known since, well, ya know, since your wife died. Before long, she'll be courting around and you're gonna be left here with an empty nest. Ah, who knows? Maybe she'll just stay here with me forever. Oh, don't kid yourself, Rick ole buddy. When those hormones start firing off poom-poom-poom when she gets that little tingling in her. uh ummh There ain't no stopping that girl. They all need greener pastures. I've taught her morality. She's better prepared. Well, that's true but still Satan and his demon army are right outside the door ready to poison and corrupt the minds of the fresh youth. Those temptations have damned many on the road to salvation. Um, by the way, you ever fix up that ole creepy cellar? Huh? Um, I did a little work on it. Uh, hauled some junk out of it. Still needs a lot of work though. Come on, let's take a look. Alright, now watch your step here. I don't know why I'm telling you. I'm the one that's gotta watch my step. Yeah. Whoow, poop on a stick. Smells so rank. It's like a dungeon down here. Oh, these are thick walls. Go ahead and yell, can't hear anything upstairs. Where's all the dead bodies, Rick? I did find a dead rat a few weeks back. Probably what you're still smelling. Sweetie, did you do your chores and read your Bible like I asked? Yes, Daddy. That's my baby girl, you are so precious. You're all I've got left in this world. You and the good Lord. Especially since your mama passed. You miss her, don't you, Daddy? I wish I could've seen her. Oh sweetie, I miss her everyday. She and I made you. She was a wonderful woman. She's the one that brought you to life but sadly when she did, she went away. I wish she coulda held you in her arms, just once. Me too, Daddy. Well, she's in Heaven now where someday we'll join her. But for now, here on earth, it's just you and me, Dalana. But you're not going to leave me too, are ya? Are ya baby? No. Promise me? I promise. That's a good little girl. Well, sweet dreams, honey. Yeah, right. He would kill us. Not tonight. Dalana! Dalana! Coming, Daddy. Just one second. Yes, Daddy? Baby girl, why haven't you finished your chores? Sorry, Daddy but... No buts Get outside and do some yardwork. Right now? Yes, right now. It won't take you that long. I finished up with everything outside, Daddy. Ah, thank ya, darling. You should probably go wash up. We'll be eating supper in a little bit. Uh, well...I also was wondering if a.. maybe this Friday after school I could go to the movies with some friends? Naw, I don't think that's such a good idea , Dalana. Why not? Why can't I go out? You never let me go anywhere. I'm sick and tired of it. All my friends get to go out. We're only going to the movies. Yeah, to do what? Fornicate? I know what teenage boys are like. They only want one thing. You know, the Bible says you should wait. Save youself in God's eyes. You don't need these demented pleasures enticed by the morning star. That the best ya got? Seduced by Satan? It's not an orgy, it's just a frigging movie. I'm almost eighteen for Christ sake. Ahhh Such language in my house! If your mother were around to hear this. Yeah, well she's not! She died so I could live, remember? I wish I would've died, then you would be happy. Maybe I would. At least she wouldn't disrespect me the way you do. Ugh...Well, that's it. You're unbearable. I am going to the movies! Yeah? Over my dead body you are! Ugh...I hate you. I'm running away! No, you aren't. You go to your room. And put on a dress. I'm tired of seeing you wearing 'em pants all the time. Psst..You're a tyrant. "Especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord." Ain't gonna take that one. What are you?...uhh...stop. We don't need these. Ah yep.....that'll do. Nice and tight. Goodnight, sweet Dalana. Sweet dreams. Such a tainted little girl. Help! Help! Daddy! Dad, please...let me outta here. I swear I won't run away, I promise. Please let me out, don't leave me down here! Daddy please! Daddy! Daddy, unchain me. Let me go! I swear I'll do as you ask. Drink this, baby girl...you need your strength. That's it. No! You need to eat to survive. You gotta keep up your strengh. Don't make this any harder then it is. You'll pay for this! People will come looking for me! Rest now. I'll check on you a little later. Let me go! Don't do this. Stop...Daddy. Hi...I'd like to report a missing person. Alright...here ya go. Two sugars, no cream...Detective Morgan. Please, call me Jack and thank you. These long days I tell ya, need a little something to put that pep in your step. Can't argue with that. So, tell me, when was the last you seen your daughter? Oh, it was about two days ago. She had revealed to me that she was considering joining a cult and was gonna run off to be with them. She said this boy, Scott Conover who she knew romantically was one of the cult leaders and he was gonna show her the way. Well, that's strange. Did she take anytihng with her? Few things. I saw a few messages online after she didn't come home. The longer time ticks by, the more I fear she really is gone away from me. Can I see these messages? Yeah...sure. So...she's made no contact with you since she's told you this? No...we had a huge fight about it. I'm of course a God fearing man. I've raised her in the eyes of the church. I pleaded with her to reconsider. She went to her room afterwards, that's the last time I saw her. Please, Detective...just find my baby girl. Don't worry, Mr. Sims. Me, as well as the police will keep on looking for her. Just find her. I will...for sure. I'll keep you updated. Thank you. Oh my sweet Dalana...you know I love you. Then get me outta this! “For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning.” Do you want to feel fire and Brimstone? Ahhh Daddy no! Stop! No! Hey ole buddy I heard about what happened to Dalana. They find her yet? No...they're still looking but they... they haven't found nothing yet. Ah man, I'm so sorry. I can't imagine the pain you must be going through. Yeah, well it's the most stress I've ever endured. Dalana's probably just out experimenting with boys. Sowing those wild oats. Man o man, losing your wife and now your daughter too. Makes you question why God does what he does. Never question God's plan. He is infallible. He will show me the right path when he feels I am strong...when I am ready. I'm sorry, Aaron. I'm just really not ready for company right now. Well, alright...ok...I'll leave ya be, but hey you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. Appreciate it. You and Dalana are in my prayers, buddy. Unchain me, you fucking monster. Watch your mouth. You're not too big for me to wash it out with soap. I gotta ask you something, Dalana. Have you succumbed to temptation? Have you? Answer me! Go die! Have you been deflowered, young lady? Are you no longer pure in the eyes of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost? I need to know...tell me! It's none of your God damned business! Blasphemy! I will not tolerate such in my house. God damn, God damn, God damn. What God would allow this to happen? Where you going? ....w...w...what are you doing? W..w...what are you doing, Dad?...No. Now, now...we gotta wash away that sin! We gotta wash away that sin. Get you clean in the eyes of the Lord. Sleep time, baby. No. Pastor Jenkins, to what do I owe the pleasure? Rick, I just came by to see if there's anything I do. I know this is an awful time for you with Dalana's disappearance and all. Thank you, Pastor. But I'm afraid I have put my mercy at the hands of God Almighty. Hoping that he gives me strength until my sweet Dalana comes back home to me. Just taking it day by day. That's all you can do. The Lord will never put on you more than he knows you can handle. All this talk of cults and demons, it can corrupt the soundest mind. And although it seems the darkest night, best believe there is a light at the end of this ordeal. Just keep in mind your daughter has only temporarily been led astray. Merely a lost soul and you know what all lost souls want? To be found. She'll need proper guidance from her father when she returns. You'll have to detour her mind from such wicked thoughts and suggestions. Thank you. I intend on setting her straight. Rick, that's great. Contact the church if there is anything at all we can do. And when you're ready, come back to the congregation. We're all praying for you and Dalana to return to you safely. God bless you. This will hurt me more than it will hurt you, little angel. There, there, Dalana. That's a good girl. I have to do this...to keep you happy so that you won't leave me all alone. You owe me that much for taking away your mother I hope this will seep into you subconsciously and you will feel fulfilled. "When thou liest down, thou shall not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken." My baby was chaste after all. Mr. Sims Detective Morgan I wanted to come back to let you know we found that boy...Scott Conover but no signs of your daughter. And while he admits to courting your girl and even trying to get her to run away with him; he admits it was a naive gesture to get her away from You and your restrictions of her. He's just lying to make you look the other way! That may be true, Rick. I assure you, we'll keep on investigating and following any kinda leads. The serpent is slicker than most can imagine. I'm sorry Mr. Sims, I don't have better news for you. I'll get back to you when we have something new to report. Okay... Proverbs Chapter 2 Verse 13 "A talebearer revealth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the convenant of her God. For her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead. None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it." Alright. Aah...guess what time it is. No...please. No....Daddy please....stop. I can do this myself. No. Yep, yep, yep. Come on, please, I can do it myself I said Yep. I said I can do it myself! Aahhuh! Ok...little grapey Come on...good girl. That's my precious baby. I got ya some pineapple...sweet, juicy. Sweet, juicy....ooh yeah. That's good...some more apple. Oh, just take it all...that's a good girl. Yeah, got some. Are you ready? Chew good. Oh, you like that cookie. I know baby girl but ya gotta eat. Keep up your strength...grape...come on. That's it. Oh...you almost took my finger with that one. You loving it. Come on, baby...that's it...yeah. Look how dirty you are. Oh my, you are just a dirty little girl. What are you being shy about? Come on. Let that clean you good. Look at that dirty girl. No need to cry...there's no need to cry. UhuhUhh. Yeah. Daddy, I'm cold. You're not cold, it's warm down here. I'm not cold. If you weren't so dirty, we'd be done. Oh God. Here's your toilet, my dear. Thank you, Daddy. Let me know if I can get you anything else, sweetie. Now, let's finish your Bible studies. Okay. "the Lord God said, it is not good that man should be alone; I will make him and help meet for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." That's enough for today. Daddy's tired. Well hey there, stranger. Aaron. Oh my goodness, what's it been, eight - nine months? Yeah, something like that. Sorry, Rick. I haven't been around much. Time's just been flying by lately it seems. I tell ya, Pastor Jenkins and everybody at church ask about you all the time. Ya know, they miss you out there. Think you'll ever make it back out on Sundays? Doubtful. But fret not my friend, I am not lost. I have Jesus here with me and we have not stopped communicating in the least. That's good to hear. Reckon a feller needs a spiritual hand to help guide him. Especially after where everything that's happened. Keep the past where it belongs. There's no need to bring all that up here today. Well, would you like some coffee? Sure, I'll have a cup of Joe. Alright, I have to make a fresh new pot. Just take a couple of minutes. Just stay here, relax, sit, read the good book. Remember how I take it, right? I believe it's black. The hell? Why's he got all this baby stuff out? Hello? Daddy? Hello? Help! Who's there? Help me! Who is that? It's Dalana. Dalana?! Aaron? Oh my God help me please, help me please Oh my...what the...oh Dalana. Please, please get me out of it. Please, please help me. Shhh, it's okay. It's okay. It's alright, I'll get you out of it. Hurry before he comes here. Shhh shh it's okay, it's okay. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still, girl. It's okay, it's okay. Sshsshssh it's okay. Sshsssh be quiet. He's gonna hear you. Please, please. Aaron, don't touch her! Here, just cut yourself free. What in God's name, Rick? What is this? How long she been down here? I just found her last week. She escaped from the cult but she's feral! He's lying! He kidnapped me years ago and chained me up here! Oh dear Lord, is that true? I can't believe this, you're a monster! It's not what you think. Oh no? Whose kid is she having, Rick? Is it yours? What a man does in his own home to protect his family. You can't be serious. Oh, you are sick. That's it. I'm calling the cops. You will go to jail and you will rot for this. NO!!! No! Stop it! Ahhh No! Oh God please...stop. Sick...perverted...disgusting...creep! Don't worry, Dalana...he won't hurt you anymore. AHHHH don't hurt my Daddy!! Daddy...oh Daddy. It's ok, baby...I'm still kicking. I thought I'd lost you. I promised I'd never leave you after your mama died I don't plan on it now. I've gotta go up and rest a bit. I'll come back and bury him in the backyard tonight, after I get my strength up. It's okay, baby, you've proved your loyalty. You can come up here with me. Does that hurt? Ah yeah. I love you, baby girl. I love you, too, Daddy. Hmmm Hummm Oooh "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh She shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man." But don't...don't worry soon you won't be alone anymore, Daddy... ...cause you'll have the Devil to keep you company in Hell !! You'll have the Devil to keep you company in Hell ! Family is a random lottery of forced tragedies It's roots twisting within every pore Helpless to deny such a scarring legacy Love, rather than hate, can sometimes destroy more. Undeservedly, we all atone for the sins of our fathers.
