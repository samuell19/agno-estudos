Lord, why are they yelling like that? half an hour break, and then get ready for the music. And there is nothing to look at me so plaintively. They are now worn, and then grow up fools and will climb the garbage heaps. And you will go to college as a person. Yes. Thank you. Oh hello. Hello. Nothing that I'm a little early? Nothing. Vanya, the break is cancelled. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Let's go to. Van, come here, I got you. Hey Kol. Why is your palm wet? Are you worried, right? Are you out of the loop?

Part C is also included. Show me. Five pesos. OK. I'll sell you as a friend for two. I studied. Here you go. Today you can. Ninety-two points. Well, not a hundred, of course, but... Well, why are you sour? Kolya Kovpinets has a hundred. He had spurs. Will do with me though... Never learned anything lived life to the fullest. Hello. And what kind of life did you live? You passed. And your Kolka will be expelled at the very first session. And what will he do then? Climb through the dumps. Right. Sooner or later, it will. And you will go to Moscow State University. Future economist. You will never fail in your life. And you will get a good job and the apartment will be like that of your grandfather. I always say Right way bears fruit not right away. YOUNG MAN Hello. I need a mini loan. For repairs. Here are written different which one is better to take? No. Go home. Fast. Fast. Sorry. Is that the window? Or where should I? No, no, that's right. What amount are you interested in? I need a million. Well... We have an economical tariff, with a minimum rate of 11.5 percent... And mandatory deposit insurance. The economy rate suits me. Grandmother. Can you read? You take a million, and you will give one and a half. Fuck you such a repair, huh? She got up and left. Go borrow money from your friends. Let's. Go, for Christ's sake. Come on, let's go. Shy. Like? Well, not bad for a seventeen year old. I was also seventeen then. I mean, I'm thirty. Seriously? You look younger. What, do you sleep in the fridge? In general, our boss is a darling. But if he refuses, you... come back in a week. This will be my office. What the hell? I was waiting for a raise. Life is a game with chairs, Vanya. Yes, I understood: on one the peaks are chiseled, on the other... No, we need to make room for a new little man, Van. Why me and not Arthur? Your scores are average. And you are the person... not sociable. Not sociable? I spent a year on cold calls year sat in the exchanger. For what? I took out a mortgage from our bank. And this? How old is she? Eighteen, Van, the road to the young. Write a statement. Fuck bald. Dismiss at work. Otherwise, I will go to court. Are you late on your mortgage payment? I did teeth. And I was going to close it for two months after the increase. Or you write the application yourself, and I personally give you a reprieve... Or I will make you very sweet life. Have you torn a blank sheet of paper? Tanechka, hello. How is dad doing? Maybe you should have signed? No. It is not right. You'll be fine. We'll manage. Look, let's not now. I'm tired. What happened? Are you upset about something? No. Well, does something hurt? No. Well, can't you tell? I can not. Tell me what happened? Yes, my God. OK. I didn't want to today because you're already depressed about work. I'm tired, Van, you understand? We've been living for five years already. This is where it never ends. Besides, I fell in love. This is the last thing I don't understand. I was not looking for love on purpose, she found us herself. Alena's birthday, right? Which one did you tell me not to come because it was rotten? We are with you from the university soul to soul. Wan, we locked ourselves in on each other, you understand? And I want to live I want to have fun I want to hang out. We hang out with you. You and I go to quizzes. Quiz, Van. And you know, in life there are actually a lot of interesting things, count up. And anyway, I want to start a new life. New life? At thirty, right? Thirty - it's the new twenty. I'll punch your boyfriend in the face. Arsen - KMS boxing. Arsene, right? Wang, enough, night. Van. You a week - pack your things and get out of my apartment. Can I pick up furniture? Are you Revzin Ivan Viktorovich? No. I am Arsen. Marker maybe? Thank you. Well, everything, in short, let's go. The passport. Seriously? I've been going to this store for two years since I moved. Is it really necessary to ask for a passport every time? Young man, I don't remember you. Here is my passport, I am thirty years old. I see. What? Do you sleep in the fridge? Hey boy. Just take your drink and go. Thanks for hosting me. No problem. What about at home? My wife is in love. In you? Anew? Listen. Isn't that your classmate, the fat one? Kolya Kovpinets? He used to be a boar. Now what a handsome man. In general, I believe that charity is... OK good. But I'm against... Do you know when handouts are? I'm all for support talented, proactive, those who fight. You know I didn't understand before memes about the son of my mother's friend. Now I'm chasing. We recently supported the school of a young leader. What is a young leader? It's like a summer camp where... the kids get the job... and where we identify the winners. After all, grades 8, 9, 10, 11 are our future, this is the future of our country. I supported the project in the youth committee, where I managed to win... special scholarship for the winner. Three five hundred a month? Much tougher. Ten million rubles to the winner. That's cool. The link will be in the description of this video. Now let's go garlic: how much are you really do you earn? I'm really embarrassed to say, honestly. Not because I... Well hare. How? Lam a day? More. Arthur here... What am I doing wrong in my life? That's what? Kolya Kovpinets for five years... At the institute, he never passed the session himself. I copied everything. And now, "how much do you cut"? Who would ask me how much I kill with a gold medal and a red diploma. Everyone has a life, except for me. Why does everyone have something? Because you open these social networks, and everything is there... get married I don't know, have kids travel on these... fucking master classes go. So get off social media. Why are you watching all this? Want, cupcakes of their signature ladies? Feel better right away. Maybe me too start a new life? Shave the beard. Then you can look at all twenty. I recently read a funny story. Immigrant from Pakistan mowed down under a high school student and studied at school, count up. To obtain citizenship in England. He was thirty-five. So what? Nobody smoked? Have you seen how the children look now? Fig understand, thirty-five or fifteen. In these mutants, damn it. Exactly. Well, nit? Your camp for talented and enterprising? Super. The first round is essay. What are you, Vanek? Are you going to a children's camp? Ten lames, Arthur. I'll close the mortgage. You said it yourself, I look like a seventeen-year-old. How do you change the year in your passport? I saw how they do it in our bank. You make a photocopy of your passport. Correct the date. And you do copy copy. Not bad, listen. Then the money is cut in half. With a fig in half? We came up with all this together. I told you about the Pakistani, you screwed it up. This is how ideas are born. No, no, I need eight million to close the mortgage. You are two. Okay, come on. Show me what's there? "Russia is a great country". Gotta get the cupcakes. No, no, it won't. Do you have vodka? Now we will write such an essay for them. Hello. Vania. How are you doing? Haven't called in a while. It's all right, mom. - And you? - I have? And outside my window is an airship with the inscription "debtor". Well, what makes you think that this is about us? Some debtor. And below it says "Revzin Ivan Viktorovich ninety-second year of birth." Vanya, how much do you need? Don't embarrass me in front of the whole yard. Not at all. I'll decide everything. Your mother, what to do? First, shave your beard, grandfather. Second, you need permission from your parents to go to the camp. It's all your drug addict friend, what's his name? Arthur. And his ideas are drug addicts. And soon he will... Climbing garbage cans? Something neither Kolya nor my friends climb in the garbage heaps. Now closest to the garbage - I am. The right path does not bear fruit immediately. Mom, that's enough, huh? So what's the right way? Why did I spend all my childhood on tutors, huh? Why did I learn to play the fano, pounded the keys for seven years. For development. And to play in the company. In company? Which company has a piano now? The Whites, huh? Now the most important thing in life be able to turn around, make acquaintances. Well, tyry-pyry chik-chirik, that's what decides. You want to outwit everyone, but you are not like that, you will be ashamed. No, you won't be ashamed. I don't want the right way. I want to be an asshole. I want fast and wrong. So please play along. Do something useful for me, for once in your life. For once, that is. So, I want to say right away that we really liked Vanino's essay about Russia. Such deep, and I would even say with some longing. Standard agreement that you trust us with your minor child. - Will there be food? - Mom... Oh sure. All five days, three meals a day. He's just allergic to nuts. Mother. For coconuts? Yes, we learn. What if something happens to him? If his guys will offend? Don't worry. We have a modern creative camp. Everything is very friendly. Mom, sign and let's go. Mom, you're overacting. Yes, I'm really worried. I watched the series "School". And how will you be alone with these... bastards. Have you retired from all social networks? Yes. Is your Kovpinets definitely not coming to the camp? That's right, he's in Singapore for a month. Bliss. Well, how? I even found my school player. N-yes. Along the way, I forgot to close. What? Portal to two thousand and seven. You even rolled up your jeans. Boomer. Well, it's youthful. No. And so? BUT? So. Let's start with something you've never done. Let's listen to the popular VKontakte. I hate rap. In order not to be fired, you must fumble for youth topics. Slang. Rapchik. Tik tok. No, no, please, no tik tok. We must, Van, we must. Heifer. Isn't that very embarrassing? Well no. Crush. Bandicoot. Beloved. So it's fashionable now. All the boys do their own curls. What for? To pussy loisili. Come on Van. I believe in you. Give this schoolboy farts. For us. For everyone. Adventure for twenty minutes. Came in and out. I'm into referrals. Everything will be a bench, bro. What? With God. Let's. What? Don't you feel stuffy there, Van, is that window fogged up? No, it's okay, it's okay. We are playing snowball. Call everyone by name. You are the last one. Or did you not listen to us? Why, listen. Igor... Vanya, Sasha, Zhenya... Anechka, Vitalik, Anton, Vadim, Julia, second Igor. Amazing. Not a single match. No one? Even with Vitalik? No, well, you mean you're not Vitalik, right? Come on, we'll continue, and you'll connect, okay? So. People. All over me. We are settling in. Let's go, let's go. Up. You know, I used to smoke too. Thought I looked so cool more mature. But At twenty-two, I realized that... coolness - it's not in that, and adulthood... Understand? Dude, go fuck yourself. Let's hurry up guys. And I will help. Let's. Thank you. No need to litter. This harms the environment. Vitalik, do you mean you are clean? I will live with you. I am not Vitalik. Vania. I am Arsen. Arsen. Arsenchik. Arsenoid. Future conqueror of women's hearts. So where is our body? Hey. Skin. I? Yes, yes, you. Where is our body? Generally wild. So, guys, free up these two beautiful beds by the window for Arsenchik and me. Listen dude. The one on the left is mine. Man what class are you from? From the tenth. And what? Arsenchik, are you there... at the door fall, don't get lost. And I'll be here. Soup with what broth? Beef. Yes, but I asked for two, but we have vegetarians. Well, I'll put them without thick. No, let's do the second and quickly. And further... means... Revzin - no nuts. Zhukova - fruit compote is impossible for her. And Davydov... Do we have anything with lactose in the salad? Listen. We all eat everything and so far no one has complained. Any problems? Elena Vladimirovna, youth committee. We're doing great, ready to start our shift. Nikolay praised you very much. I hope everything goes well and the grant is in your pocket. Are you going to follow us? I have an offer right now. Let's not embarrass the children, I will be like the third counselor. Firstly, I will see everything from the inside, then, you know, I have experience twenty years in education before... joining the party. CPSU? Young man, how old do you think I am? No, not the CPSU. But almost. Are you Vanya? Is it busy here? Fall down. Guys. Enjoy your meal. I repeat My name is Lera. I am glad to welcome you to my school of young leader I am Nastya. ...We have been holding it for more than a year... And why are you aggroing the counselor? ...for experience... What? ... communication, fun. Are you a rebel boy? ...this year you are very lucky. Thanks to a wonderful person, businessman and philanthropist, Nikolai Kovpinets. Yes, these counselors themselves are like children. Twenty years, no more. The youth committee drew attention to us. And we have a solid cash prize. It would be better to take care of the conditions of our stay. What is it, five people in a room to settle, huh? And this Sovdepovsky dinner. You're funny. Looks like my dad. He, too, is always dissatisfied with everything. He sits by the TV and boo-boo-boo-boo. We have a league table and the one who scores the most points on the basis of all competitions, and get a prize. But. You are all already finalists and great fellows. Truth. The truth is that only one will get the money. The rest is nonsense. And remember: you, of course, all handed over the phones, but, nevertheless, if one of you is noticed for cheating or spying on the Internet - instant disqualification and bye-bye. And you don't like it at all? Well, today after dinner, the first test awaits you. Yes. You will need to make an oral presentation for exactly one minute. No, well, counselor, like, nothing. Only a counselor? No, you're very cute too. Looks like Gadget. For Gaika? Well, which mouse. Gathering in the gazebo. So what about quiet time? Well, I think that money should not stand still, as it loses its value due to inflation. Money must work, constantly move, which will benefit not only me, but also... the economy as a whole, the state society. I would invest to your own startup. And one of the most promising areas now is the area cyber influencer. It seems to me that the most important thing for a person is a family. I have eight brothers and sisters and, unfortunately, we do not live very richly. But I would definitely share the money I won so that we can all get a good education. We could be a great team. They would become mafia. Hey! In my opinion, the modern world is a global village. And every person just needs to be open to the world and know several languages. With the money I win, I'd like to take a trip around the world to see how people live all over our planet. In addition, I would like to live in Japan. And get a higher education there. It is one of the most advanced countries in the world and besides, I'm a little addicted to manga. Passion fruit. I agree that money should work. But I don't believe in internet technology. It would be much more reliable... funds from the winnings to buy an apartment in New Moscow. In a couple of years, the metro will definitely bring it there and... The apartment will rise in price twice. So. Let's take a look at your speeches. Almost ten. Hang up. No, please, just give us ten more minutes. It is forbidden. The same rule for all camps. Is there something wrong with my presentation? Well, let's start with the fact that there was no internal logic in it. And I think you sued me. Well, for the first time, I'm sorry so be it. Watch me tomorrow. What is this, a threat? No need, young man. And then sanctions will have to be applied. What sanctions? Do you have a camp? "friendly" - do not punish children. Or do you want to touch my second knee? I'll touch you, if necessary, for what you want, understand? Live in the body. I have digital hunger. If I don’t scroll through insta now, I just won’t fall asleep. Yes. Let's have an imaginary insta. I post our room, the hashtag is “my team”. Lois. Counselor Lera posted a photo in a bathing suit. Her-boy, yes, yes, like, heart. Like and throw off a member in direct. Mine? Of course not. Big, beautiful. From google images. From google images. What is this, player? Yes. Where did you buy? On Gorbushka. Where? On Ali Express. What are you listening to? You will not go - this is rock. Toxic man. And I'm not Vitalik. How tired I am. You just woke up, rocker. I hope it washes off. Tattoo - topchik. I am the first. (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Vanya, everything. Time to sleep. Now, mom, I'll just finish the ballet, okay? Okay, but not for long. Hello. I am Vanya. You entered the wrong house. Not properly. What, they decided to lower me, right? I'll put you all down myself. And you, bully, maybe you will fill me up, but once you fall asleep... You know how they beat you with sharpening in the zone, huh? Like this! So! So! Van, are you quiet, were you sitting, or what? Sorry. I'll wash it, okay? Good morning Pavlik. So what do you think? I don't look like anymore to an old woman from the CPSU? No, you... It goes very well. So. I see you all have already divided into teams. Vanya, you need a team. What about the meaning? The money is still only one will get. Who wants to be on a team with Vanya? I will. And let's get some more... Arsen. The first test is called "Eggfall". Each team is given a raw egg. From improvised materials you need to build a protective container in order to drop an egg from a height of five meters, and it did not break. You have fifteen minutes. Let's go. Foam rubber! Share with everyone! Eat it, slob. He will now wrap the egg with foam rubber and that's it. And we generally won some garbage left. Well, that's it, we ruined the ice rink. Calmly. Calmly. I saw something similar in the program "Crazy Hands". And who is leading it? Dziuba? Yes, you go. Look, we need to make a box and fix the egg in the middle with a rope so that so that it does not hit the walls. Five minutes for testicles. Five minutes. Hurry, five minutes left. Well. So, we need to make two holes. Got nails? No, it's over. Okay, give me the knife. There is no knife. Well, give me your knife. Where do I get a knife from? - You all have a knife. - Who has it with "us"? So, Arsen, we can lose the first contest. I don't have a knife. Arsen, give me a knife, I know there is. How can I have a knife? Arsen, now, however, we will lose. Let's. Time. Well. Let's start. Team number one. Get ready. Whole. Congratulations. Pretty boy. Have you put the box together? Of course. Team number... Two. Well. This is obviously broken. It even splashed on my face. It splashed on the face. Quiet-quiet-quiet. Spent. Logic assignment. The faster you do it, the more points you get. The numbers are in alphabetical order. Lightweight. I am everything. Well done. Reproduce this tower as accurately as possible. For everything about everything - five minutes. Go. Fifteen matches is not bad. All twenty details, well, wow. Cool. How about that, huh? Are you a rain man? Count how many of each detail is here, huh? Well, count. Quietly. Van, I think we have already talked about smoking. Pash, don't goofy. I'm not Pasha. I am the counselor Pasha. And for assholes like you, I won't be friendly anymore. From that day on, fines begin. Therefore, minus ten points for smoking. Hey, it's not fair. You can't change your own rules. You're so smart. Just beyond my years. Quite. By years, my young. Oh well. Another minus ten points for bickering. And remember I'm here - the rules. Don't care. I still can't catch up with Yegor. He is smart like Einstein. And beautiful, strong, bold. Such blue-eyed boys will save Germany. Stop it, you... Much cuter. AND... in general, come to me after lights out. What for? Hello. This Revzin. He's kind of muddy. If Lena sets him on fire with cigarettes... In short, I had to introduce a fine, otherwise he does not obey me at all. Listen, she's more annoying to me. All the time, as if... someone is looking over his shoulder. How are you? Lerochka. And what is such a curmudgeon? I have an offer. Let's celebrate our second day. M? The fact is that alcohol is prohibited in our camp. Yes? Well, it's forbidden for children. Yes, but we must set an example for them. And I thought I was the main bore. Come on, come on, Pavlik. Spill. You were talking about Revzin just now, right? About this idiot? From which tobacco is rushing all the time. Well. Let's just be honest. The slip came out. The guy did not fit in, did not fit in. Oh no, I have... own. As they say, always ready. You know, when I was a kid, I often didn't fit in. - Yes? - Yes. My parents constantly drank me. Well, as if to study well. And the kids at school, on the contrary, hated it. Run it, run it. Because I'm an upstart and a nerd. It is very important for such children that someone believes in them. Let them open up. This is the essence of our school. Well, yes. I will talk to him. Which sweet idealism. Well. Pavlik. What are we going to do with you? Cards? Strip. Kidding. Kidding. Although... Does not work. Yes? Dude. I won't win. All the kids here are smarter than me. One guy is a fucking genius. Vanek, pull yourself together, you are twice as old. I've already spent my share mentally. I can't, well... Take me away from here, please. Nothing will come of it. I called my mom. That's how I understood it. Van, shall we go talk? You need to stop smoking and arguing with Paul. You were a confident middle peasant. And after penalties rolled down to nineteenth place. Well, that means it's not destiny. Do not mind it. Kill it. Yes, you can use "you". Vanya, there are still a lot of tasks, you can recoup. The prize is cool, but... It is more important that you discover your strengths here. I don't know... unleashed my potential. I do not believe in these fairy tales from American cinema about... Discovering strengths, unlocking potential, believing in yourself and so on... Every movie has a main character, but there is... A man in the background who is running from a falling skyscraper and... This guy is me. You are seventeen. Why such pessimism? Well, what do you think, did everything work out for me in this life or for someone else? True victory does not come immediately. But what about Kovpinets? He also worked very hard. Tell me, who is this woman next to Pavel? She is... He looks at him with such tenderness that at first I thought it was his mother. Honestly, it depends on her whether I will have my big school in the future... or not. This is my dream. What were our cool races. We were constantly having fun, without any of this boring stuff. I miss all of this so much. Well, and now I need a... Pretend. Someone else. To solve the problem and move on. Something like that. OK. For your dream I promise not to argue and not to smoke. Thank you. Van. You're better than you think. What's going on? I don't know, you're the one holding my hand. What's going on here after the break? BUT? We decided to play a little "حبل الموت". BUT... And what are the rules? You need to move the box to another building. And then? And then another box in another case. Interesting. And then. Kojima is a genius. Let's go to Sifu, shall we? No. Arsene is a sif. No, don't. Come on, sleep well. Sif? Does it have something to do with syphilis? No matter. Well, sort of, here... It hits you - you throw it at another, and he drives. Ivan, we agreed. Well, Aunt Lena is probably already busy. Someone said that he lacks fun. BUT? Arsene is a sif. What, are you crazy? Egor. From today we have fines for violating the regime. Say thank you that I burned you, not Lera. Everyone would get minus thirty points. Live in the body. Sorry. Running. Crap. I played something. It was hard to pretend all the time, wasn't it? Yes. Crap. I'm sorry. It... It's my fault, it's not pedagogical. Okay, what are you? Van. Stop. What are you? You are seventeen, I am twenty-seven. And in general, a march to bed. I thought you wouldn't offer. To your bed, Vanya. Alive. Will we be fined? What is that, lipstick? E-boy! How is it? Did you manage to shake? Really, you're not as noob as I thought? Have you ever been with a girl once, well... for real? It would be sad if it never happened. Guys don't talk about that. Hang up. Van. I mean, we need to talk like adults. Ler. Yesterday was a really stupid situation. But... we have a competition. I am a participant, you are on the jury. Not fair to the other guys. Yes, and Aunt Lena will not approve. So come on postpone until the end of the trip, and pretend that nothing happened? Okay? Well class. I didn’t go in yesterday, I thought, okay - sad-boy, hiccup... Are you already shipper with the counselor? Nastya, I'm sorry. I really didn't understand you. And p... Excuse me, do you have any normal coffee? So, espresso? I just can't wake up without it. Wow, my God, what business. Espresso for him. Drink cocoa. It will be more useful. I see. Thanks. Bon Appetit everyone. And we have a surprise. The man, who... he did a lot for us, which we all really want to see. Meet Nikolay Kovpinets. What are you? I'm not here. Cover it, please. Will you come to me after lights out? I'll come in, I'll come in, if you don't give me away. Here you. Why are you here? Here is breakfast. Not in the canteen. In the camp. For what? To win ten million rubles. Right? Wrong. Money is just paper. Nothing. Take a look. Can this be the main thing? No. Love. The main thing is to accept it and give to others. Quiet. Here you. What can you do better than other people? M? - Paint? - You draw. Wonderful. Here you. Black. Yes. What can you do better than others? I dont know. OK. You are painting. You give this world love and beauty by investing in your work. But you need something to eat. So? Somewhere to live. Alas, you can't come into the shop, hand in your drawing, and get paid for it... Sweets. Well, let's just say you have candy, but you need a car... You have a car, but you need a drawing. Do you have a drawing but you need candy. How can we all get what we want? With the help of money. Well done. The name of? Arsen. So I thought. Come on, Arsen. Say it again, only louder. With the help of money. Again. Louder, bolder. As Plato shouted the word "Eureka", come on. Money. - How stupid he is. - I can not hear. Again. Money. Let's help Arsen. Together. Money. Again. Money. Again. Together. Money. Yes, money is the equivalent of your talent, your love, your energy. Yes, get off of these pancakes. Show your drawing. I buy it. Now you have money to get candy. That's how it works. But I wanted to keep it for myself. - Quiet. The more you give, the more you get in return. Share your energy with the world and never do not stop. Here I am... I will never stop. I am both a coach and a hockey player, and the pilot and a firefighter and revolutionary... And I not about one hundred but I'll fall in! Yegor Davydov - who is this? It's me. - It's you. - Yes. Will you stop? No. You're going first now, will you stop? No. Who will stop you? No. The correct answer was "no one", but that doesn't matter. My children, life is a game of king of the hill. We all crawl through the mud to the top. Will you get there? Yes. At any price? Yes. I charge you for success. I charge myself for success. I can ten times a day charge for success the whole country. Together. I charge you for success I charge myself for success, I can ten times a day Charge the whole country for success. And now a photograph. Nastya, where is Vanya? Was he in the dining room? - Are we waiting for someone? - Yes. If we have one bad Vanya Revzin. It's his own fault for not being photographed. Everyone should be in the photo. Wait one more minute? I had one classmate with the same last name. Far from a genius. Lerochka, take it off already. Thank you. Is everything ok in Singapore? I thought you were away for a month. Yes. But it turns out that cross-eyed people can work quickly. Yes, nothing. It's all good, not-to-la-sho. Yes, a very interesting game is about to begin. I won't stay, I'm sorry. Only in transit. Affairs. Look, we both have a lot of work to do, but we need to find some compromises. Stay for at least an hour. Aren't you interested in what you've invested in? I invested in you. And besides, it's not that I don't like children, well... They just piss me off a little. It happened. But you are great. You are great with them. Let's do it. When you return I'll rent a suite in the city and we will arrange an awesome romantic. M? Is it coming? Goes. I'm sorry. For what? Forgive me. Well, it's finally all together. So. A true leader is, above all, an excellent strategist. Therefore, we will play a strategic game with you. You will manage states from ancient times to the present day. Each country initially has its own bonuses and penalties, which you will need to properly dispose of in order to achieve one of the possible victories. Points will be given to the first four places. What, Arsenchik, did not suit? The rules are on your tables. Explore. So. First move. - Building a city wall. - I open carpentry technology. I send expeditions to Japan. I propose a trade agreement. I accept contracts with England. I am building an army. For now, I'll probably dig a little. Next move. Well done, China invented gunpowder. Italy enters the New Age. Well, congratulations, the Middle Ages are over in the Czech Republic. Yegor, can I sit with you? And then there Sasha spits at me. Bro, I'm sorry, I don't have much space, I'm sorry. Yes, you have the biggest table. I right here on the edge. Please. For this line you don't start. Understood? This is the table for me. Why does Egor have so many chips again? He's in the lead. Has he played this game before? Ruled out. The game is my graduation project at the Faculty of Game Engineering. They come up with faculties. Attack Russia - I will pay you. Still, I can't win. But you ruin his glasses. Yep, myself too. And the US will win. No. Imposing sanctions against Russia. We have already signed a contract for gas. I will deliver gas to you in cubes, I have the technology. It will cost twice as much. I know you want the Kuriles, my friend. These are your northern territories. Let's. I have a "Political Scandal" bonus card. I can ruin Yegor's reputation by 10 points. I knew you wouldn't let me down, Your Highness. Egor kabzda. Listen, there Yegor made some kind of pogrom on the desk. May I sit with you? Lord, okay, sit down, just be quiet. US move. Build banks. Arsene, don't tell me. Okay? Banks are profitable. Damn, I said I know what to do. Live USA. So. Ten moves have passed. My fleet of Admiral Marshal is approaching Vladivostok and I land my troops in Primorye... And I use the bonus card "Reversal". And it says that at any time in the game, move your opponent's chip by six... cells back. What is this game? What's wrong with this game? Why? It should simulate real life. Where have you seen that in real life... the fleet sailed for ten years, and then an unknown force pushed it away? What? I unlocked this bonus when I built the Egyptian Pyramids. Yes, and by the way, I also have a big question about these Egyptian pyramids near Samara. The move is made, all according to the rules. Egor. Yes, I use the Skolkovo bonus card and open the Perpetuum Mobile technology. Scientific victory. Fifty points for Russia. Hooray. This is a Skolkovo bonus card for money laundering. Why did he have only good bonuses throughout the game? Where are these cards “Laziness”, “Alcoholism”? I don’t know, there, “Why do something, we won’t change anything”, huh? Van, exhale, I think you got a little carried away. Young man, do you... not happy with the victory of Russia? Yeah, okay, what about second place? So. Let's count the points. Second place. Takes forty points. Occupies Israel, economic victory. Your mother, Arsen. How did you accumulate so much gold, huh? Secret. Third place, thirty points - USA. And fourth, twenty points - England. Thank you all for playing. Well done. Fucking pyramids. Egor, Egor, listen, I'm sorry, I... What? I freaked out, I was wrong. You are really cool. To me... I am very interested in how you managed to win, well, what tactics did you follow? Ah yes... just kind of intuitive. I put these Egyptian pyramids, and that's it. Ah, those pyramids, right? Yep, these. Okay, do you understand that these are the Mayan pyramids in America? Dude, what's the difference? What did you dig up? Ok, I'm sorry... What is the capital of Brazil? Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Yes, Brasilia. I'm sorry, okay. and... Last question... how many planets are in the solar system? Dude. Fuck them. Yes, he's dumb. What, all right? Get out. (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Began. Guys, hurry up and grab your phones... Come on, come on, come on. ...and call Kuza. Crap. How to get through to this smelly Kuze, Kol? Still they call. And they play like shit. I think I got it. There is no real way to call. This is a base. But such... suckers like us make them a rating. But that's not fair. Life, in general, along the way, is not an honest thing. Or we are being deceived or we are cheating. Arthur, something is not clean here. That's why Kovpinets needs all this, m? What is its benefit? And Aunt Lena is here for a reason. Find me everything about this contest and... about one participant. Egor Davydov, seventeen years old. Well, how can I find you? I'm not a hacker. Find your ingredients. So work for your share. Check. Check. Check. Ol inn. What do you have there? girls, let's have a party, shall we? So hang up in two minutes. It will be a secret party. Yours or ours? You. We just stink of socks, five guys, you know. Deal. So. What are we sitting? Well, let's, let's, let's get together, the girls are calling to a party with them. Is that where Nastya is? Yes, yes, yes, where Nastya is. Come on, come on, come on, let's go. In the same place, the counselor Pasha is in the corridor. You are through the window. Let's. And you? And I will wait for Leroux. So if you see a sock on a doorknob... you understand what's the matter. It's like American Pie. A. Well, okay. - Okay, let's go. - Everything, come on. ABAVAGAGA. You've knocked me out twice already. You have a party there. I thought it was so much fun. Yep, they're all assholes. Look, I'm sorry, I'm tired. Highly. Going to sleep. You have a player like my dad. What are you listening? You don't know it's rock. Well, I actually like rock. Especially indie. Muse, Franz Ferdinand... Kasabian, Arctic Monkeys. And you don't listen to rap? No, I love the music of the zero. Zero is a great time. OK. If you're such a nerd, then... I'll show you something... from our. Funny I... Never kissed before. Nast. BUT... don't you think you... in a hurry at seventeen? I'm not seventeen, I... fourteen. Your mother. Nastya, this is wrong, go away. I won't go anywhere. Why do you keep turning me off? You don't like me at all? No, that's not it, it's just... Okay, then I'll leave. We walk again after lights out. Let me smoke. Which, quite already, is alive in its own... What do you think, put on these shorts, like in Jurassic Park, everything is possible, right? So you? And I'm like this. What, not so cocky anymore, huh? I will teach you discipline. You will sleep in the hallway. You go into the room - minus one hundred points, understand me? Is that a flashlight in your pocket or do you love power so much? Just try to get out of here. This is a flashlight. I myself will earn prostatitis. Again. Hello? Did you find anything? Estimate, Neo from the Matrix is ​​also a program, it turns out, and the chosen one is Agent Smith. There is evidence. Yes, in Kovpinets. BUT. Yes, it looks like it's clean. He just defended his camp project. He was given fifteen million. Five on.. for holding, ten - for a prize. Five to hold? Then why are we in this camp and not in Bali, huh? So, and Egor? I found his spurs today for all assignments. Wow. What will you do? Selling my main competitor. How about the rest of the kids? You're right. I will beat Kovpinets with his own weapon. Dig further. He promised not to bully. Ler, I'm sorry, can I ask you a question? How did you meet Kovpinets? I once invited him to our master class, as a successful businessman. He was interested in the project and presented the idea in a competition to the committee. So, you know him well, don't you? Good enough. We are a couple. Two boots. But I almost believed you. What are you talking about? Think, true, naive. What am I surprised? It's the same in our country. A million rubles are allocated for the construction of a playground, and they are building for a hundred square meters from... from tires, the rest - in your pocket. M? Van, what are you talking about? Kovpinets has never honestly done anything in his life. He even managed to sell free travel cards at the institute. And you drank the camp well, right? How? Five million? Van, you drank, or what? What are you carrying? Are these rooms for five people really worth a hundred thousand a night? Or two hundred? Well, that's enough. I thought puberty ends at seventeen when you blame others for all your troubles. But you're not seventeen. Judging by your actions, you are no more than twelve. I thought about canceling Paul's punishment, but no. Sleep in the hallway all night. You're not twelve, you're seventeen. How did you hang out with the girls yesterday? Fine. And why did Lera punish you? Have you been rude? Who will understand these women. New day - new victories? Lost something? BUT? No, nothing. Well, you can sort of... - Like give them a bonus. - I do not agree. We should separate motivation and stimulation. The reward is a short-term stimulation, and it is important for us to set the task of personal growth. And how could you lose your spurs? Why the hell did you even take them? Couldn't you have learned it yourself? Yes, there are a lot of these sheets. Jerk, can you win the last task? Yes, I don't remember what it was. OK. I'll take care of everything. Hello. Arthur. We almost won. Bliss. What did you find about Yegor? Egor Davydov is the son of Olga Davydova, and she is the daughter of Nikita Kovpinets. In girlhood - Olga Kovpinets. And Nikita Kovpinets is the father of Nikolai Kovpinets. Wait, wait, that is, it turns out that Yegor is his... - Nephew. - Yes. Listen, don't you want me to fly a drone over Kovpinets' house? When did it help? Did Lera know? Somehow I don't even believe it. Came on camp mail everything you found yesterday about money. Let's see her reaction. Yes. So. Someone is cheating. Taken straight off the tongue. Yes, some of the children have cheat sheets. Where? All tasks were selected by Pasha and I. Nobody knew anything. The information is reliable. So who do we have at the top of the table? Everyone, everyone needs to be searched. Well, let's start right with you, shall we? What? Four million seven hundred. They are not with you, by any chance, with you, huh? I don't understand now. Didn't grab too much? Lerochka, do you really think that all this is for me? No. There's a big queue from respectable people. Yes, your mother. The meaning of my camp is that children honestly achieve everything on their own. And I, in fact, was involved in a corruption scheme. - Get out of here. - Enough. Enough hysteria. We are adults. Go away. You have money for a taxi. Okay, she ruined everything herself. Well, quietly, quietly, Ler, what are you doing? You said it right, well done. Don't fit in. She has already got me with her pensioner flirting. Everything is fine. But still about the cheat sheets. Maybe we’ll replace the last contest after all, huh? Please. Yes, what cribs, sir? Okay, I'll replace. If only you could calm down. Thank you all. Busy, I see. Sorry. Oh, listen, well, these provincials are something with something, they can't just come and sign a contract. You definitely need a sauna, a bath... I know everything about the budget for the event. Kohl, how could you? I did trust you. Wait girl... Let me explain to you. I didn't want to involve you in all this. Didn't mean to upset you. I wanted to take this sin upon myself. You see, this is life. That's how everything in this world works. If you want to get something then you have to share it with someone. Well, that's how it works. But we do know. We personally did not take a penny of children's money with you. I don't want my school like this... Lerochka, forgive me. Sorry. I'll come tomorrow. And we'll take care of everything, okay? Now take a break and get some rest, okay? Kiss. OK. And so I get... Lyulei? No, two. Double from the foot. No, a deuce - an assessment. I come home, my father looks at the diary, and... What happened next? So. Arsen. For the first time in my life I did not learn algebra, I got two... Fuck, of course, history. Okay, I'm waiting for the version. Well. So... What I think? Which version? Yes, I know you are not sleeping. And, you, probably, to Vanya? Should we get out? What? No. How about disco? Right now. After all, tonight is the last night. M? Why is it always like this? Do you like a girl and she likes someone else who doesn't care about her? You are more like moms. What? Well, older MILFs. Like Lera. Well, yes. MILFs. Nastya fell for you, but not for me. Arsen. You're a good guy. I'm... I remember, too, how at your age I was worried about girls. At what age? Well. Half a year ago. Look, love is... strange thing, but... It doesn't matter if he loves you, then suddenly falls out of love. If you like a person you do something nice for him. AND... You will be fine with this. Yeah. I... honestly, at first I thought you were a shit man... And you seem to be fine. Nastya will not dance to this. I'll go help you. Put something from zero. BUT? Super. Let's. Nastya, what do you think about Arsen? So come on, this is our last night at camp.. Nast. Nast. Nastya. What? Nastya, that's enough. Stop. I understand you. Listen, you... You are the smartest of all of us. Your parents must have screwed you over. Permanent circles, sections, tutors. Please don't hurry. Well, you still have it. And a simple kind and naive childhood... It cannot be returned. I'm talking about my childhood... fucal. Now I'm trying my best to catch up. Well, fuck with your Leroy. Kima. Nastya, well... Fucking forest. I'm sick of these ribbons. This task is especially for you. Kovpinets will tear off our heads if you fill him up. Go have a rest. Stop. Did you find the spurs? No, someone stole them from me. Who? Who? Maybe the one who played well today? Revzin. Yes, of course. Okay, go get some rest. And I him... google it. Where are you. Yes, Nastya left and... Yes, it doesn’t matter with Nastya. Look, I need your... trauma. Are you already? Where is my injury? Your own leg. So you are an old man. Quiet. Don't you dare scream. What are you really... Will you shoot me and bury me in the forest? I really need this money. Everyone needs them. How much did Kolyan promise you? I will give more. So old and so dumb. Yes, he will not give you his money. Do you really think that Kovpinets won't outplay you? He will destroy you. Excellent. Now... Repeat your confession. Crap. Pasha. Ghouls-ghouls-ghouls. Where are you? Come out. I did an internship with scouts, Van. I can hide in the forest forever. Like Rimbaud. Crap yourself? Tick ​​out of town. Toby... Help. Stop. Oh, why are you being a hero? Leave me, go get your grandmas. Dude, shut up. I'm on the edge. How kind we are. You are even worse than me. I'm thirty myself, I decided to beat the high school students. And that didn't work out. Loshara. Ten is a prize. Five - holding. Total: fifteen lyams. You could steal, well, half. Well, two-thirds. But you, bastards, sawed everything. What did you get to me, huh? Yes, I'm only a hundred. It's actually you, the boomers, who came up with the "development of budgetary funds." Do you think I care about children? It's a pity. But I'm just a cog in this system. I was just following orders. You talk like Adolf Eichmann in court. Father. Is there an emergency room? M OK. Everything will be fine with him. Where did you get hit? One hundred and seventh kilometer, near the boarding house. Carried it for that long? How did Sam carry Frodo? They say there is no true friendship. Can you tell me when he wakes up? Well... Three or four hours will lie down under anesthesia. Tell me, can you... Watch... Six seven? Drip it there with glucose, saline. The man got tired. We need to rest, recharge. Can. Thank you. Damn, where is this Vanya? Have you seen Pasha? - We don't know. - No idea. OK. Wait... No more. We must start. There he is. I'm sorry, this is... The morning is beautiful, I decided to take a walk, well... Birds are singing. Well, finally, Your Excellency. I will repeat the rules especially for you. We are looking forward to orienteering. What? Run through the forest? How does this reveal business leadership in us? Are you ready for another mission? Wait. So. There are three dots on the map. There are ribbons of your flowers. Find all three and run to the finish line, to the ski slope. The winner gets 100 points, second place gets 80, third place gets 60, and so on. All clear? Well, Egor? Is everything fair now? Without spurs? Yeah. I have a pentathlon category. Get ready. Alive? Egor. Your uncle is using you. You're a normal guy, stop. Egor. Nobody can stop me, you understand? We can still win. No, no chance. No. Yes, look. I'll take your ribbon now and you run to the third point and take both of ours. We'll see you before the finish line. So. You will come first, and I will come second, then we will have equal points. And we'll both pull. Nastyush, you are the head. Well done. You can immediately see - I didn’t go mushroom picking with my grandfather. Van. Let's run. I can't, I twisted my leg in a ravine. Okay, come on. Sorry. Sorry. Van. Let's. Let's. (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Vania. Vania. Vania. Vania. Vania. Vania. Van. In the evening you will be taken home, and there will be an official award. Everyone will congratulate you. Nikolay Kovpinets will arrive. Van, what's wrong? Can I help you? Excuse me, please, we urgently need to go - his mother got sick. But the good news will put her on her feet. Yes. Thank you. For all. Brother will deliver. Brother? No matter. Congratulations and... Hope mom gets better soon. You know, I wanted to tell you so much... Can you tell me, please, if the check can be cashed immediately? This can only be done by Vanya's mother or Vanya himself at the age of eighteen. Account in PromMosBank. Do you know this one? Ignatik, hello. Can you brotherly find out in our bank where you can quickly cash out? Prize check. Yes. Come on, thanks. - Will you sig? - Dropped it. Handsome, handsome. Vanek, let's live. I even, count, we looked after the land for the plantation, so in general - everything is high. I am a bad man. Nothing better than Kovpinets. Well, don't worry, everything will be fine. You only deceived the deceiver. You know, when I was fired from work, I asked: “Why me, and not Arthur?”. And you are my best friend. This, of course, is all sad. But it's a sin to grieve with two lyamas in your pocket. You fixed it, so... Do you remember at uni? The shame will pass, but the credit will remain. Great words. Okay, let's go to the bank. Let's go. Arsen, why did you help me then? Well. If you like a girl, you just have to do... something good for her. So. Alright folks, let's wrap things up. Now everyone in turn will say what they learned new on this trip. Nastya, you are the first. I have known incredibly strong sex drive at the same time... with the pain of indifference. But along with this, I realized that I should stop falling for the bad guys, and look at the good ones. So let's move on. Van, you're back. And we are just summing it up. Arsene's turn. Why are you gathered around the fire, like at the Grushinsky festival? Would you like to the bend of the guitar was sung. Yeah. I wanted to say that you all... Cool guys. The most intelligent, talented, you are the future of our country. Even you two. You should go to one institute. Assemble a KVN team to let... Loisili. Loisili. Here. Arsen. You are awesome. It's really strange that you you carry a trauma and a knife with you, but... but you are the most decent one. Nastya. You are the smartest. You're only fourteen, and you... played us all. Lera. The camp is a very cool idea. Thank you. I hope, what is your dream about a big real school someday come true. I wanted to say that I don't deserve this money. So is Yegor. He had spurs that Pasha gave him. I also used those spurs on the fourth day, so we both played unfairly, but... I probably even... More dishonest. Did you find the spurs? Because I don't... I'm not seventeen. To me... Thirty. This is indeed... Like in the movie "Macho and Botan". Only without bachi. Excuse me, I... goat and jerk. Just... I never had a childhood. And here, in these five days, I... received. I survived it, I got it concentrated like Yuppie juice. Well you pony... You do not understand. I realized that... To grow up You need to say goodbye to your childhood. Beautiful words. He appeared like a real movie villain. Meet Vanechka Revzin. My classmate. Yes. We are peers. You have always envied me. But to pretend to be a teenager for five days... Wow. Well, it's a total brain drain. But the joke is that you couldn't even cheat here. You don't even have the talent for it. Where am I to your scale? Lerochka, you know I shared with someone to make it all happen. Thanks to me this wonderful, talented boy earned ten million. But the rest received invaluable experience. Yes? No, Yegor had cheat sheets, and you are also somehow involved in this. What are you dumb? Egor is his nephew. Here, Kovpinets with his cousin. And who is this little one? BUT? Here you are, tough guy. Egorka. It's you? That's it, how you grew up. I remember you like this. Wow. Did he win with his talent? Yes. I have many relatives. There are many of us, Kovpintsy. All around Russia. Who are you, huh? Three adult men. And all three are such fabulous pi... balabols. Lerochka. My good one. Lera, bunny. These two are nobody. Morons. I'm sorry. Wanted to wait for your return. I will do everything for you. School. University. Hospital. Intergalactic station. The whole world is at your feet. Let's just pretend it didn't happen. Well, after all, we have publicity... to nothing. Stupid. Who else will play with you in these fucking camps? Who will invest in you, how much I, huh? Infantile. Pick up the ring, it's from Tiffany. Kohl, wait, I understand that the "Call Kuze" program broke you, but... One call to the bank - and the money will still be with me. Suck. But I am an adult, not a child. Again in the nose, damn it. Guys, I did not finish. We've already cashed the check. Well, I worked in a bank, I have connections there. How well everything fell apart and tied up. So the money is here. Arthur is in the car. Arsen and Nastya deserve... four million because they are the real leaders, with no connections and... cribs. The remaining money can be divided among all participants, except for Yegor and... me. Ler, well, you'll figure it out? Yes? Well, did your scam succeed? Satisfied with yourself? Satisfied, mom. First time in life. Satisfied. Each such plastic bottle - this is one dead fish in the world's oceans. That is why I decided to invest in a recycling business. As Greta Thunberg said: Tu handu dee pony yet. It's in Swedish. Still, you climb through the garbage heaps. Yes, I'm telling you, it was lemon. I do not share, of course, your... humor. The passport. M. And how old is the boy? As a young life? I took out a loan to pay off a mortgage. I work as a cashier. Divorced. Here I am. Joke. Rock out. Thank you for not leaving me in the forest and... brought to the hospital. Come on. Pash, I'm sorry, but... Do you know where Lera is now? I can't find her at all. Hello children. Sit down. This time you overestimated your youthfulness. Ler. Excuse me please. I have a lesson. Forgive him, Valeria Alexandrovna. That is, you have already persuaded the children, right? He gave us money. Bribed. Even better. Let's try again. What are you talking about? Which one again? Well, I know how we can get rich. Your camp. This is indeed cool idea. I've never had so much fun. But not for children, but for adults. I even came up with contests. There... fishing, barbecue. Sudoku solution for speed, and who will stay in the steam room longer. So. Remind me how old are you? Well, I'm thirty-one now. Are you sleeping in the fridge? Lehr, Listen. Right way, truth, gives fruits are not immediate. And get on this right path right away... also doesn't always work. I'm sorry. Give me a second chance, please. Second chance. Second chance. How much did you give them? Let's start all over again. Let's help each other get close, get married, we have... children will appear. Such, and such cute. I... I will never let you down again, honestly. Are you always in such a hurry? I am thirty one. I can still do everything. I I charge for success you. I charging for success... myself. This is genius. Great. (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |)
