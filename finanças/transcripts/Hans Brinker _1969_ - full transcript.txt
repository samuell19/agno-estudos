How long would it take you to become a doctor, Hans? - And what makes you think anyone's gonna give Hans Brinker the chance to become a doctor? - You'd do it. I know you will. And you're gonna cure Papa. - Maybe after that I can do something about that empty head of yours. - My head's not empty. (Hans exhales) You can't help it. The female brain is much smaller than the male. It's a medical fact. - See? Already you know more about such things than any boy in Holland. - [Hans] Ah, here comes Mama. It's a good thing, I'm starving. - Guess what we're having for supper. Sausages. - [Hans] Who told you that? - Mama. The money from the sewing. And she's going to save up and buy you a pair of real skates for Christmas. And you're gonna enter the race on New Year's Day. And you're gonna win the silver skates. - Yes, and the fairy princess is gonna turn this cottage into a castle. - Did you get the sausage, Mama? - He had a bowl of soup. - Good. - He smiled, Mama. Did you get the sausage, Mama? - Supper will be ready in a few minutes. - Where's the sausage? - Stew is better on such a cold night. - Mama, the money from the sewing, you said. - Madam Boumer hired a kitchen girl from Haarlem who does very nice sewing. - So there'll be no more sewing money?

Mijnheer. Good morning, Mijnheer, can you use any coal today? - What, what is it? - Coal, would you like to buy some coal? - Gold? What kind of gold?

(orchestral music) (dogs barking) (door knocking) - Good morning, Mijnheer. Would you care to buy some coal for the stove? Nice, hard coal. Very cheap. - Where did you get it? - Well, I just found it. By the railroad tracks. - Just as I thought. Railroad property. Stolen coal. - No, Mijnheer, it was just lying there. It falls off the trains, you know. - [Mijnheer] Do you think the railroad paid for the coal? - Well, yes. - Did you pay for it? - No, Mijnheer, but-- - [Mijnheer] Did the railroad give it to you? - Well, no. - Then, it's stolen.

Business is always good. But I'm not getting any of it. - Hello, Hans. - Oh hello, Carl. - Good morning, Master Schummel. And how may I serve you? - I don't suppose you have any beef today. - Beef, no, I'm sorry. But I have some excellent venison. - Give me two pounds. - Two pounds. - You know, as far as I'm concerned, the worst thing about living in this back wood village is that you can get so little of that good Scottish beef, but you wouldn't know about that, would you now? How's your father, any better? - The same. - Oh listen, my grandmother's looking for a maid. You might tell your mother to go and see her. - My mother is not a maid. - Just trying to be helpful. You know, it's Holland, your family living in a place like this. You'd really be far better off in Amsterdam. All kinds of jobs in a city like that. And a lot of charity organizations. - You really are a big-hearted fellow to worry so much about the Brinkers. I can't tell you how grateful it makes me. - Just trying to be helpful. - Two pounds and a little over. No extra charge. - My mother will weigh it at home. She'll pay you later. Oh, do you have any bones? - You mean for the dog? No, I don't. Not today, I'm sorry. - It's all right. I was asking for Hans. Well, I knew you wouldn't ask for yourself. - I pray you, mademoiselle, said Antoine. His voice, trembling. Ask that I leap from yonder window. Ask that I plunge this dagger into my breast. Gladly will I do thy bidding. But ask me to absent myself from thy sweet presence. Far more easily could I die. Angela's lips parted. She was about to speak. Her luminous eyes, indeed, were already an eloquent spokesman for her impassioned heart. Then suddenly, engulfed in a tide of passion, Antoine swept her into his arms. His lips hungrily seeking hers. Angela's supple form grew limp in his powerful arms as she swooned with the rapture of his kiss. - All they ever do in that book is kiss. - I think you only swoon from Frenchmen or Italians. I don't think it happens with Dutch boys. - I wouldn't want to swoon anyway. What good's that? I'd rather know what's going on. - I'll bet Annie would swoon if your brother Hans kissed her on the lips. - Be quiet, Hilda. (door knocking) - Annie? - My father. - I've got to go home now. - So do I. - Come in, father. - Goodbye, Mijnheer Bouman. - Goodbye, Mijnheer Bouman. - Goodbye, girls, my regards to your parents.

Just like real ones, thank you. - You know, it's amazing the way those skates work. - They're all right until the water soaks into the wood, makes them stick to the ice. - You haven't been around for a few days. - I've been in town looking for work. - [Friend] Any luck? - Yes. None of the doors that were slammed in my face broke my nose. - You know, there's one good thing about those skates. If the ice breaks, the rest of us will go right to the bottom of the river while Hans goes floating along the water. - Hello, Hans. - Hello, Jacob. - Come on, Peter, you said you wanted to lead the snake. - Wait until Hans gets his skates on. - Oh come on, those wooden skates slow everybody down. - Go ahead, Peter, I don't feel like it anyway.

Stay there, Jacob. - People notice, people always notice things, you know? And then they say, hm, I wonder what's going on with those two. - That's the most foolish thing I've ever heard. The most foolish. - Yes, but that's the way people are. And we must pay attention, even to foolish people. - Why? - Because you must live in this world. And the wise person must learn to take some foolish things very seriously. So, even though Mrs. Bouman and I both know that you and Annie are only very casual friends, we think it would be best if you didn't spend so much time together because of the foolish people. That's all. - I like Annie very much. I like to talk to her. She's not like the other girls. And she likes to talk to me, I know she does. I don't see what's wrong with that. - Hans, when your father brought me to this house, I was very happy. It was just like the house I grew up in with my parents and my brothers. And I knew just what to do with this house. I'd been doing it for a long time. When I was Annie's age, my hands were red and rough and strong, not at all like Annie's hands. - Mother, I don't like this. What do people's hands have to do with it? - I don't like it either, but there are some things you should be told because to find them out for yourself can be very painful, Hans. - [Gretel] Mama, Hans. Look what Annie gave me. - Oh my goodness, such elegance. - Isn't it beautiful? - [Dame Brinker] Oh yes, real fur. - [Gretel] Hans, isn't it beautiful? - Oh, what do boys know about these things? - He doesn't like me to take clothing from the other girls. But I don't see anything wrong with it. Do you, Mama? - No, what's wrong with giving the poor Brinkers your cast-off clothing? It's better than throwing it away with the garbage. - Hans, this was given by Annie with love. And what is given with love should be taken with pride. - [Annie] Gretel. - Well, why didn't she come in? - She doesn't think Hans likes her to come into the house. - I was wondering if you were home. - It's a very pretty jacket you gave Gretel. - It's much too small on me. Are you going to Hilda's party tonight? - I don't think so. You know I'm really not very much for parties. - I know. You and Gretel are coming to my house St. Nicolas Eve, aren't you? - Well-- - You'll like it. It's really not like a party at all. I mean, nobody dresses up or anything. - Well, if I'm not busy. - [Annie] What's wrong? - Nothing. - Something is wrong. Are you angry about the sweater? - [Hans] No, I'm just very busy. - Has somebody been saying something to you? - Saying something to me? What are you talking about? - My mother and father want me to spend less time with you. - [Hans] Yes, I know. - It's so foolish. - A wise person takes foolish things seriously. - Why? - I don't know. I can never understand wise people, can you? - I should very much like for you and Gretel to come to my house St. Nicolas Eve. - Well, maybe it would be all right if we don't spend too much time together in the meantime. - All right, Hans. Hans. Can you fix this clamp for me? - Look, Papa. Look at my new jacket. Isn't it beautiful? I think he likes it, Mama. - Yes, your father likes pretty clothes. Don't you, Raff? He brought me my blue velvet gown from Amsterdam. He used to love to take me dancing in it. Didn't you, Raff? You remember. - He remembers, Mama. - Oh, he used to love to dance. Didn't you, Raff? - He's dancing, Mama, he remembers. Oh, Mama, that's so nice, I've never... No. - Raff. - No. - Raff. - Papa, no. - Oh, Raff. - No. No, Papa. - Raff. - Hans! Hans, quick, he's killing her, quick! Hans, quick! - [Hans] Stop it. Stop it, please. - I'm fine, darling, he didn't hurt me. He wouldn't hurt me. - What happened? - It was my fault. I got him excited. It was my fault. It was nothing. It was nothing at all. - [Hans] Close the door, please, it's very cold in here. (orchestral music) (pleasant music) - Careful. Will you build a fire for me? - I've been here too long already. Your mother will worry. - She's not here. And besides, we don't have to talk or anything. Oh look, Hans, it's a drawing of the silver skates, the prizes for the race. Oh, look at that, the skates have got little bells on them. - Well, that's a clever idea. Now the fishes swimming under the ice will know when somebody's skating by up above. (Annie giggles) - Well, they may be silly, but they're pretty. Don't you think so? - They're very pretty. - [Annie] What is it? - Dr. Boekman. - What about him? - Dr. Lars Boekman, famous surgeon formally of this town, for the past 10 years, resident of Sweden, is in Amsterdam at the bedside of Mayor Van Meer of that city, where he's been called upon to perform a most delicate operation. Dr. Boekman is staying at The Golden Eagle Inn. - You're thinking of-- - Oh, it's silly. - Hans, Peter Van Holp and the other boys are skating to Amsterdam to get in condition for the big race. What would you have to lose going to Dr. Boekman and asking him? - Wouldn't I be something to see, trying to get to Amsterdam on my wooden skates. Goodbye, Annie, I'm going home now. - Thank you, Hans. (pleasant music) I'd try, but I'm sure he wouldn't take it from me. But you could do it. - I don't know, that pride of his. - [Annie] Look, there he is now. Here, please. - Hello, Hans. - What can I do for you? - [Peter] It's a business proposition. You know that necklace you carved for Annie for her birthday? - Yes. - Could you make two for me by St. Nicolas's Eve? - [Hans] Well, I might. - I want one for my mother and one for my aunt, Inge. I'll pay you seven guilders. - Oh, I couldn't charge you. - And what do you think? That I would accept your work for nothing? Don't you think I have any pride? Peter Van Holp pays his way, in advance. - I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. You must have known him. Even 10 years ago, he was famous. They say he moved to Sweden because his son ran away from home one day without a word. It made him very sad. He's known all over the world for his marvelous operations. - Who are you talking to? - Talking? Nobody was talking. - [Gretel] Hm? - Do you think you two females could take care of the house for a couple of days while I'm away in Amsterdam? - Amsterdam? - Whose are those? - [Hans] Mine, of course. - How did you get them? - In the usual way. I bought them. - Hans, now you can be in the big race. - What do you mean you bought them? How? - Oh yes, I forgot to tell you. I'm doing a little job of carving for Peter Von Holp. Necklaces for Christmas gifts. Seven guilders, paid in advance. - Mama, seven guilders. - I see. So you bought ice skates. - Well, Mama, how else could I go to Amsterdam to see Dr. Boekman about operating on Papa? - Of course. You're right, of course. - Oh, Papa, do you hear? You're going to be well. You're going to have an operation. It won't hurt him, will it? - Who knows if we can even get Dr. Boekman. - We mustn't be carried away by our hopes, we don't know if Dr. Boekman will want to do this. And even if he does, if it will work. It's a long time Papa's been sick. A very long time. - [Peter] What did you say, Carl? - Here comes Mr. Wooden Skates. - [Peter] Not today. - Oh, Hans, you've got real skates. What happened? - St. Nicolas. I've been such a good boy. He didn't want me to wait till St. Nicolas Eve. (Peter chuckles) - All right, you men, this is your captain. Attention, fall in.

He'll be back tomorrow. - All right then, so will we. - What happened? - He'll be back tomorrow. - Do you think he'll see you? - I hope so. - I know you don't like to have your face washed. Well, that's too bad. Maybe you think this is fun for me. I only do it, you know, because every now and then I get to wondering if my handsome husband is still there under all that dust. Anyway, we've got to be good and clean for the famous doctor. Hm, I can just hear him now. Madam, you expect me to operate on such a dirty fellow? Did you see how happy Hans was with his skates? How long he's dreamed of real skates. I hope soon we can get some for Gretel too. Although, it doesn't matter so much to her. She will see how quickly she's become a woman. (sighs) You know what's silly? Sometimes, it makes me sad, the way they're changing, growing. You watch them, you cannot see them change. Suddenly, they're not the same. Don't stiffen up so. It won't be long before you'll be giving her away in church. You will. You will. Yes. Dr. Boekman may be too busy this week. Next week. But there will be a doctor. Oh, there will be a medicine. You will see. And then, my lazy fellow, you'll have to wash your own face. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The vacation will be over.

Come with me and see how it's done. My dear sir. - Yes, master? - [Carl] As you can see, my friends and I are all gentlemen and used to nothing but the best. - [Innkeeper] Yes, I can see. Very distinguished company. - And your inn, without meaning to hurt your feelings, it could hardly be called first class. - There are fancier places in Amsterdam. - And we would ordinarily stay at one. - I wish you wouldn't. - We thought, just for the change, it might be fun to try one of the shabbier inns. - You do me too much honor, I'm sure. - Yes. And I imagine you will be more than happy to feed and lodge us overnight for four guilders. - Oh no, master, you and your friends are far too elegant for my shabby place. They'd make it look all the shabbier by comparison. And as you yourself point out, it's already shabby enough. - Now, just a minute-- - I don't think I can afford to take you here and have you here at any price. - Carl will be Carl. - Thanks for the lesson, Carl. Very educational. What do we do now? - Yes? - I want you to notice, we're not all well-dressed and elegant. In fact, a fellow such as myself makes your place seem luxurious by contrast, don't you think? - How did such an ordinary duck get in among all the peacocks? - They're all fine fellows. And the truth is we only brought along five guilders for expenses. And if you don't take us in, we'll have to sleep in the streets. We throw ourselves upon your mercy. - I don't know. My establishment's been insulted. I'm a very sensitive person. - Carl insults everybody. He means no harm. He'll apologize, wait a minute. - Yeah, go on. - Go on. Go on. - Please, go on. - Mijnheer Kleef. Mijnheer Kleef, I apologize. Your inn is very attractive. - In its shabby fashion? - Yes. No, it's not shabby at all. - Very well-furnished? - Very. - Comfortable? - Oh yes, very. - All right, lodging for one night and one meal. Five guilders.

Life and death will be the death of me. Sit down. Well? - It's my father. He fell from the dike in Broek. It's 10 years now. He doesn't speak. He doesn't move. - You live in Broek? - Yes, sir. - Do you know how busy I am? Do you know how many people are waiting for me to save their fathers and their sisters and their sons? - When my father gets well, he'll tell us where he buried the savings and we can pay you. - The savings? - Over a thousand guilders. - What makes you think that's enough to pay my fee? - My father will make more. He's one of the best stonemasons in Holland. (Boekman chuckles) - I'm expected in Munich on Thursday, life and death. I was supposed to go to Copenhagen tomorrow, also life and death. How old are you? - 17. - And how old's your father? - 37. - Ah. So the accident happened how long ago, 10 years? - Yes, sir, 10 years. - Get me some more hot water, please. Oh, not on me. In the water. - I'm sorry. - Good, empty it. Where in Broek do you live? - On the mill road, near the river. - Mm-hmm. I used to live in Broek myself. - I know, sir. - 10 years, that's a long time. Uh. I can't perform miracles, you know? Only God can perform miracles and I am not God. It pains me to admit it. Does he move at all? - Yes, sir. - His hands? - Yes. - Does he move his head? - A little. - This much, from side to side? - Not quite that much. - Can he walk? - Yes, sir. - 10 years. Now, I left Broek 10 years ago myself. - I know. - Well, then you know why. - Yes, sir. - He was just about your age when he ran away. 10 years, that's a long time. Is he strong? - Very strong. - I'm expecting a message. If I'm not needed in Copenhagen, I may drop by and see your father. - Yes, sir. Thank you. - [Boekman] Hm. - He tried to kill my mother the other day. - I am not God. - Thank you, sir. (orchestral music) - Really, I'm surprised at you fellows. Only one bandit with a knife. Why not a whole gang of pirates with swords and axes or even African savages with spears? - Well, it's all true, Jacob. - That's right. You should have seen the knife. - I was thinking about that thief with his ferocious friends who were going to hunt us down. - [Carl] And cut off our ears. - Listen, you don't suppose... - Ridiculous. - [Peter] Impossible. (orchestral music) - [Voostenwalbert] We better hurry up, it's getting dark. I wanna get home before dinner. - [Ludwig] You would. - [Voostenwalbert] Will you stop picking on me? - How was Amsterdam? - Marvelous. I saw Dr. Boekman. - I know, I saw Peter. How are the skates? - Marvelous. I'm very busy. People are waiting for me in Munich and Copenhagen. I finally told him, forget about it. - [Annie] Oh, you weren't rude. - No, just firm. Felt kind of sorry for him. - Well... - Well? Goodnight. - Goodnight. I wonder what time it is. - 12 minutes and 14 seconds past eight o'clock. If the old moon isn't running slow again. Come on, I'll walk you to the bridge. Maybe I can work up an appetite for supper. - Oh, Hans, let's sit and talk for a minute. I always have an appetite. My mother says the way I eat, it's a wonder I'm not as a big as an elephant. (Hans chuckles) - I ate a lot in Amsterdam. You should've seen that food. First, they brought potato salad and pickles and the best bread I ever ate.

He's going to your house. - Yes. Yes, he is. Goodbye, Annie. - Goodbye, Hans. - There's a piece of bone pressing on the man's brain. I don't think the brain is damaged, but I can't tell. It's a very difficult operation, very dangerous. - You've done it before. - If everybody's skull was the same thickness and every man fell on his head from the same height and the same way, then all operations would be the same. But they are not. There's a chance I can bring back your father. The chance is just as good that he will die. The chance that he will die may be a little better. Do you want to take the risk? It's up to you. - No, they'll kill him. - My husband wants to take the risk. - Now, you two in the other room, please. - I stay with my husband. You go stay with Gretel, she's frightened. - [Boekman] I order you to the other room. I order you to the other room. - I stay with my husband. - At an operation, the doctor is never disobeyed. I order you to the bedroom. - I stay with my husband. - No, not the, the little one, quickly. That's it. Don't get in my light. More ether. (dramatic music) - Papa's gonna be angry when he sees they've shaved off some of his hair. - Doesn't require as much physical effort as taking a bath. Why does it always exhaust me so? (sighs) He'll be unconscious for several hours. Well, it's St. Nicolas Eve. Are you expecting a visit from the old gentleman or doesn't St. Nicolas know about the Brinkers? - Before their papa's accident, St. Nicolas came every year. - And this year you had Dr. Boekman. - Uh, Hans, why don't you take Gretel to Annie Bouman's house? They'll be expecting you. - I don't want to leave. - Neither do I. - I order you to go to Annie Bouman's. Your father needs only me now and I will be here. Your mother and I will be here.

I greet ye all. Good children ye have been in the main since I last accosted ye. Diedrich was rude at the Haarlem Fair last fall, but he has tried to atone for it since. Mayken has failed of late in her lessons. And too many sweets and trifles have gone to her lips and too few stivers to our charity box. Now Diedrich, I trust, will be a polite, manly boy in the future. And Mayken will endeavor to shine at her studies. Young Kathy has been cruel to the cat more than once. Oo hoo hoo, St. Nicolas can hear the cat cry when his tail is pulled. Now, I'll forgive her. If she remember from this hour that even the smallest dumb beasts have feelings and must not be abused. Master Broom, I warned ye that boys who were in the habit of putting snuff upon the foot stove of the school mistress may one day be discovered and receive a flogging. Hans and Gretel Brinker have been courageous and helpful to their mother in times of great trouble. Their father's life is in the hands of God. May the new year find all treading the paths of obedience, wisdom, and love. Tomorrow, you shall find more substantial proofs that I have been in your midst. Farewell. (orchestral music) (people chattering) - You can come tomorrow morning and see what St. Nicolas has left you. Hans? Gretel? - What? I'm sorry. - Nothing. But I do feel it's a good sign that your father is having his operation on St. Nicolas Eve. (Boekman sighs) - His color is better. Also his breathing. - Well, you're very observant. You sound like a medical man. - I want very much to be a doctor someday. - So did my son at your age. You know why he ran away? - I have heard. - It's that he caused the death of one of my patients by mistake. He thought he had. Patient's death was not his fault at all but he thought it was. And he was not strong enough to face me. Or himself, I suppose. To be a doctor, you must not only be good enough to cure, you must be strong enough to kill. - Mijnheer Boekman, doctors don't kill. - If your father gets well, I'll be Dr. Boekman, the genius. But if he dies, to your mother, your sister, and you, I'll be Dr. Boekman, the murderer. - We would never think that. - You would never say it, but you would think it. Well perhaps, perhaps it is I who would think it. - I think a man is blessed to be a surgeon such as you, Mijnheer, no matter what. (sweet music) - Has he-- - Not yet. - But shouldn't he-- - I would like it better if he'd regain consciousness by now. - It'll be as God wills. (Boekman chuckles) Don't you believe in God, Dr. Boekman? - Oh yes, he's helped me very often. Other times, when I've needed him, he's been on vacation, which I don't begrudge him. - Mama, Hans, his lips moved. Papa's lips moved. - Well, it looks the town of Broek is going to get back its best stonemason. - Thank God. - You see, Hans? When they live, he gets the credit. But when they die, you get the blame. - Welcome home. (pleasant music) - 10 years. 10 years. - Is that Papa talking? What a beautiful voice you have, Papa. - How have you managed? - We've managed. We worked. - You can see by the look of us we haven't starved. - Your brother and you are strangers to me. And your mother is... I don't remember her being so beautiful. - Oh, you made me drop a stitch. - I'm sorry. How long did the savings last? - The savings? We never-- - We never went hungry. The savings lasted a long time. - Oh, I had a bad dream last night that you didn't know where the savings were. I was trying to tell you and you couldn't hear me. I was shouting in the roots of the tree, in the roots of the tree. You couldn't hear me. - There are no savings in the roots of this tree. (loud thumping) (dramatic music) Oh, Raff. Raff. Oh. - I wanted to see if I could stand up. - Do you want to hurt yourself. In time, everything comes in time. - Good morning. - Good morning, Dr. Boekman. - [Raff] Good morning, doctor. - [Dame Brinker] What is this? - That's for you. - How nice. Thank you. Oh, Raff, sausages. Wine. Caviar, chicken, cheese. - I hope to repay you soon, Dr. Boekman. - Why is your heart working so hard? - Ah, he tried to get up and walk. - I'm as weak as a baby. - Mm-hmm. Your brain is sending messages to your body for the first time in 10 years. Now, your muscles long ago gave up any hope of hearing from that brain. They went out of business, you understand? They've forgotten how to do their job and they don't want to go back to work. Now, they'll fight for a long time. And you must let them fight it out. The brain and the muscles, all by themselves. If you step in, they'll both turn on you and kill you, hm? By New Year's Day, you'll watch The Silver Skates Race. All this providing they remain very quiet. (melodic music) May I? Where did you get this? - He had it when he fell. - [Raff] Somebody gave it to me. A boy. - A boy, tall and thin? - Yes. Yes, a boy. - [Dame Brinker] You know this watch? - It belonged to my son. I gave it to him on his 16th birthday. I haven't seen it for 10 years. - Ah. - Well, what did he say? - Easy, Raff, it's all right. - Forget it. Don't upset yourself. May I keep this? - Yes, yes, of course. - And tomorrow you will sit by the window for one hour. You and Hans will help him. Oh, by the way, you just paid my fee. (window tapping) - Mama, Papa, Hans. Look what I've got. - [Dame Brinker] Real skates. - [Hans] What happened? - Hilda. Her grandmother sent them from Denmark. And she already had a new pair for St. Nicolas Day, so she gave them to me. Look, Papa. - Now both the Brinker children will be in The Silver Skates Race. - And both the Brinker parents will be there to watch. - I'm going to practice on them. - [Hans] Yes, they're a little different from the wooden ones. - What happened to the old dead tree? - We've cut it down for firewood. - That's it. The old dead tree. I got to go somewhere. Now remember, Papa's only allowed to sit up for one hour. - That was a very friendly tree. It kept us warm and now it gives us a thousand guilders. - Now? - Oh, did I say now? (chuckles) Raff Brinker, when you get a little stronger, we have a surprise for you. ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Don't wake the night ♪ ♪ Don't break the dream ♪ ♪ And in the morning ♪ ♪ The golden horizon ♪ ♪ Pours sun through the shadows ♪ ♪ Just open your eyes ♪ ♪ Be astonished to view ♪ ♪ The golden tomorrows ♪ ♪ That we all pursue ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ How they're waiting for you ♪ (ominous music) - [Lawrens] Tell my father, give him this watch.

(upbeat marching band music) (people chattering) - So I sold them at 13 guilders 50. - You could've got 14. - Yes, I know. But wait till they see the bowl. (organ music) - As usual, she is. (gasps) Look. - They're just children. - I say, disgraceful. - [Annie] Good luck, Hans. - [Hans] Oh look, here come your parents. Look, watch out for the dog for me. - [Annie] Hello, Mother, Father. - Go ahead, hurry now. - Goodbye. - Good luck, good luck, Hans. - I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Mama. Easy now. - Hans, I want to win for Papa. (bell ringing) - Girls, will you please move to the starting line for the first mile? - First the girls and then the boys. Oh, do you remember they race until somebody's won twice? - I remember. - Take your marks. (drum rolling) Go! (crowd cheering) (pleasant music) - Hurry up. - Come on, Gretel, come on. Come on, Gretel, you'll make it. - Oh, Dr. Boekman, happy new year. - Happy new year. - I was wondering if we'd see you. - Oh, I wouldn't miss it for anything. I'd like you to meet my son, Lawrens. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Dame Brinker, Mijnheer Brinker. - We have met once before, I believe. - [Lawrens] I was so sorry to hear about your accident. - Oh, so was I. And I must apologize for taking so long delivering your long-delayed message. (upbeat music) - This is going to be a happy new year. (crowd shouting) (crowd cheering) Oh. Oh. Oh. (crowd applauds) - [Announcer] The winner is Gretel Brinker. - Hans, I won, I did it. - You did it, I told you. She did it. I knew she could do it, I knew she could do it. - [Announcer] Boys first mile. - Oh, Hans, hurry or you'll miss your race. - They save their favors for their pets, don't they? If I'd have been this late, they would've started without me. - Carl, that's not fair. - Please, Peter. - Take your marks. Go! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) (Dame Brinker chuckles) - He's falling behind. - Don't fall behind, Ludwig. - [Onlooker] Hurry up, Peter. - Come on, Jacob, come on, hurry up. (crowd cheering) (crowd shouting) - Oh. - The winner, Peter Von Holp. (crowd cheers) - Mom, you got my ear. - Wait until I get you home and wait until your father hears about this. Oh, good thing he didn't see you do it. - Girls third mile. Take your marks. Go! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hans, my strap. - It's been cut. - Carl's skate when he tripped me. It cut into the leather. (upbeat music) I've been cheated of my last chance for the silver skates. Hans, what are you doing? - No, please, Peter. I want to. - But what about you? - It's not right for you to lose your chance because of someone else's unfairness. - But-- - And when you win the silver skates, I want my strap back. (upbeat music) - [Kid] Hurry up, hurry up, come on, hurry up. (crowd cheers) (Dame Brinker laughs) - Boys second mile. Take your marks. Go! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (orchestral music) - Peter's strap was cut. - [Bystander] Hurry up, hurry up, come on, hurry up. - [Child] Hurry up, Peter. (crowd cheers) - The winner, Peter Von Holp. (crowd cheers) (triumphant music) The winners of the silver skates, for the girls, Greta Brinker, for the boys, Peter Von Holp. (crowd cheers and applauds) - Why did you give Peter your strap? No, why? - Why? Maybe because he needed it. And it seemed to me, at that moment, that I didn't. That I'd won enough prizes this week. - You're right. It's not necessary to have silver skates to be a doctor. Hans, if he wants to, is is joining my son and me as an apprentice in the medical profession. - Hans is really going to be a doctor. - Yes, Gretel, the son of a laborer. - I bet you've heard, my father was a dried herring dealer. (all chuckling) - You have made this the proudest day in Papa's life. - [Hilda] Gretel, Annie, come on, The Grand March. - Oh come on, Hans, The Grand March. - You go. I'll be with you in a minute. (marching band music) (romantic orchestral music) - This is a happy new year isn't it, Hans? - It's more than a new year, Annie. It's a new future. For both of us.
