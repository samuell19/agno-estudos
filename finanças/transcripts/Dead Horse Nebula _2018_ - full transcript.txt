Hay! Are you coming or not? Hasan, is your field nearby the lake? No, Fethi Aga. Since the water level rose, all our fields by the lake are now under water. The one I’ll show you is up on the hill. Past the olive grove. You sure about this? Just give it a push, Hasan. I give up! Hay! What are you doing there? Come here. I’m talking to you. Come here. What are we gonna do about this? No idea. What should we do? Let’s pull it by the legs. Take it a few meters away, so it won’t pollute the well. It’s too heavy. Stop, dear, don’t run! Do you know her? My sister-in-law. Don’t run, dear! Come! Step up. What are you doing here? What? All right, let’s go. Is everything ok? We’re trying to move this horse. Poor thing. It was here for water, maybe. Probably. It’s dead. What will you do then? Ok! Start the engine. Easy! Drag it slowly! Hold on tight. Hey, hey! Hasan, stop her. Sibel, stop! That won’t work. It’s swollen up, heavy as lead. Isn’t that Ethem’s horse? I think it is. Let’s call him. He’s probably at the coffee house. He’ll be here in five. Hello? Ethem? Fine. Your runaway horse… Yes, it’s dead. Yes, really. The guys found it. It was by the well. Come take care of it, will you? - Selamun aleykum. - Aleykum selam. Hi, Ethem. Hello. Hello, Mumin. What going on? My son found your horse. Did dogs do that to her? The boy poked it, Ethem. You dragged her, too? We tried, but didn’t work. Her flesh has probably turned flabby. We should call the gendarme. They’ll take care of it. Hello? Our horse was found dead out on the field. It’s Ethem Suren. Yes, from Karacaoba. Between Karacaoba Village and Zrafta. Right by the well. Hello, commander. Hello. You must be the owner. Yes. Soldiers, secure the area! Good afternoon, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Was it attacked by animals? My boy… He poked it, commander. Soldier! Come here, son! Write down what I say. Who was the owner again? Me, commander. Name? Ethem Suren. How long was it missing for? For three days. Any fatal disease? No, she was healthy. But quite old. And, who found it again? My son, commander. And I guess you tied the rope. We tried to drag it, but it didn’t work. I see. What’s this region called exactly? Karacaoba, Cesmealti. I see. FORESTRY Hello, chief. Hello. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. What have you done to the animal? Commander, let’s move these vehicle. Ok, chief. Gentlemen, please move your vehicles. Orhan! Drive over here. Circle around. Approach facing the body. Dig up the ground in front of it first. Then we’ll take the horse. There was this seminar back when I was in university. I decided to go. I thought it would maybe impress our professors. I didn’t want to be there, though. I was dozing off and waking up… And a Chinese was talking. I was dozing off again and when I woke up… A Japanese was talking. Dozing off and waking up again… A German was talking. Suddenly I found it interesting. He was telling about how he disposed animal carcasses found in open field. Three dynamites on torso, each weighing one kilogram. Half a kilo dynamites on each foot. And one last one on the head. Also half a kilo. Then they blow the animal up. Boom! It’s broken into a thousand pieces. Becomes part of the earth. Pour gas all over it. Don’t miss a spot. Pour over carefully. Over here, too. Don’t rush. Enough. The wind may be blowing towards you. - You better light it from this side. - Step back immediately. Watch out. Step back! Come over here. Watch out. Let’s move back a bit more. Mom! Mom, open the door, quick! Come. Let me help you. Just a second. Get up! Come on. Get in. Brother, do you want fried eggs? No, I don’t want anything. Do you grant your permission? I do. Do you grant your permission? I do. Do you grant your permission? I do. Shall I go? Sure, I’ll manage. Ok. Girl, grab my bag! Are you all right, Miss? Is there anything I can help you with? I’m fine. Thank you. There’s too much wave. We couldn’t find him. Too much wave. Waves will probably carry him onto the shore. I’m calling it off. Ok! Ali! Come here! Yes, sir! Take these boys out of the sea. Yes, sir! Then we’ll leave, too. Yes, sir! Gentlemen! Clear the water! You need to come out! We’re clearing the water. Hurry up! Everyone needs to get out! Come on now! Out of the water! Out! Hurry up! My friend! Out of the water now! Hurry up, come on! Come on, out now! Hurry up, come on! Poor kids. Poor kids, indeed. So, they’ve found him yet? What kind of prick are you, man? What’s the smile on your face for? What did I say, man? Are you blind or what? Those kids lying on sand are barely fifteen! Well I didn’t fucking drown them, did I? Like I have anything to do with it. Man, I don’t understand why you were so mad at me. Sure you don’t. You would have come out of the water yourself if you were capable of understanding. Didn’t you see the gendarme? The ambulance? The rescue team? I did. But what’s the use, man? Was I supposed to go out and save the kid? They told me to come out, so I did. I don’t understand, man. Those people over there just lost their kids, they’re in such pain, but you just keep swimming. You would have been swimming with me if the incident took place just five minutes later. Maybe you would keep swimming, too. There were people swimming nearby as it was happening. I’m sure everyone went back in as soon as the soldiers left. You get mad no matter what I do, man! Why would you say that? I just want you to give a little thought into what I say. That’s all. You’re way too laid back. There’s great fish here, you’ll see. Can you point the light over there? Look! See that? What’s that, man? Ömer, sit down! He has a rifle, man! Easy! I shot the fish. Sit back! What’s going on? Just hanging around. Where are you coming from? Whose cow is this? I’ll catch you later. See you! Now go. Let go a little, then reverse. Now come fast. - Ok now? - Ok. When we were kids, we had once gone to the lake, or may it was the sea. You, me and Seko. There were two other guys. Seko’s friends… I don’t remrmber their names. Alkim was there, too. Some were playing chicken fight and some football. Then we’d had a somersault competition under water. Seko had won. Everyone would take turns jumping into water for a somersault. We would count how many we did, then add five more to the actual number so we would win. When it was my turn, I was so determined to outnumber Seko that I held my breath and… One, two, three, four, five, six… I was somersaulting like a tornado. Eventually I was out of breath, but I knew that I had put Seko away. Then I wanted to come out of the water. But I couldn’t reach the fucking surface. I was trying, but it just wasn’t happening. No light… No sand… Darkness all around. I didn’t know where I fucking was. Then a hand grabbed me… and took me out. I was out of breath. And as soon as I was out, I looked for my brother Seko. Turns out, I had lost direction under water while doing somersaults and moved away to open sea. How about that one over there? Let’s take it down. Ok. We need a rope for this. No problem. Reach for it. A little more to my side. Pull a little. Ok. You got it? Ok. Pull! Once more. Almost there. Pull! Pull! It’s coming down! Pull! One last time! That was a tough one. Ready to take it? Let’s do it. Come on. It’s all there… except for after secondary school. I don’t remember anything from high school. Once my brother's friend caught me smoking in city center with friends. I can’t remember the kid’s name. I shit may pants for a month wondering whether my brother had found out. Maybe he knew but played along. Ömer, stop. What happened? Just stop. Hey, you! Hey! Can you get our ball? He’s not hearing us or what? What’s up, bro? Good. What’s up with you? Good, how about you? Enjoy your beer. Was everything ok? It was alright. So you cut it and all? Was the road clear? Yeah. Everything was ok. I’ll take the truck inside. That’s a nice log though. - It will pay a night out. - Yeah? That felt nice. - What? - The beer. We’d almost finished it. Serkan? Ömer? He’s busy with the pulley upstairs. You can go help. Ok. Ömer! Hey! Over here! Seko! Is here ok? Here? Here? Pull. Wait a second… Pull. Pull. Give it a hand. - I’ll go upstairs, then? - Ok, go. - Is this the spot? - Yeah.
