(chuckling) And napkin? Mm-hm. Don't forget to tip your waiter. (chuckling) How's the sequel coming? Well as soon as Dylan the unlikely warrior prince defeats the dragon I'll be sending it to you for editing. Can't wait. Hey! Carrie-- Yes. um, I'm wondering if you, you owhave a minute I'd love to pitch you a story. Sure! So it's this story about this fairy who leaves the fairy world through a drop of dew and she becomes a real girl who befriends this little lonely boy and together they go on all sorts of misadventures. I like it. You do? Yeah. That's great! Um, I have been working on a rough draft so I can just keep plugging. Forward the idea to Ed. Let the writers do the writing. (sighing) I'm sorry, Jenny. Don't give up. Eventually, one of these days she's gonna have to publish one of your stories. (family singing "Happy Birthday") All right, Mom. Make a wish! (cheering) Happy Birthday, babe. Thank you. Oh, Meg. How many layers is that? The one she's looking at for the wedding is six. Does that mean you guys are planning the big day? Actually, Tony and I have a little announcement to make. Meg and I have finally decided on a wedding day. Oh! Meg, Tony! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present! So when is it? Spring? Summer? Winter, actually. Oh, so in a year! Well at least that gives us plenty of time to plan. (chuckling) Actually, it's this year! Like, in four weeks. What? Okay! (chuckling) Okay, don't freak out, everyone. Because it's all planned out. We are all going on a destination wedding. (gasping) Is it Hawaii? Guys, let it be Hawaii. I wanna learn how to surf! It's not Hawaii. Well. It's exactly the opposite. We wanna get married at "The" Ice Hotel. Isn't that different? And cold. I'll say! Mom, don't worry. They have everything we need for the wedding- a beautiful little chapel, a whole village with cafes and restaurants and shops. What do you think? I think it sounds amazing. Meg: Mom? The Ice Hotel is so beautifully magical. We really think it would be a dream. Tell them to get ready because the Walshes are having a wedding at the Ice Hotel! Yay! (laughing) Perfect. Jenny: Okay. So, uh, shoes and accessories. Check. Your dress-- your dress! Oh, yeah. Tony's just running it up the street to get pressed. He's gonna take the next shuttle. What do you think? Has Mom gotten over the fact that she wasn't able to invite every single Walsh in the country to the wedding? Maybe that's why she's taking the later plane. Maybe she's packed the plane with Walshes. (laughing) Okay, good luck, 'cause we are not gonna all fit in that hotel. No. Um, have you heard from your boss about your book? She sees me more as an editor, so. Shoot, I'm sorry. You know what? I'm just gonna chalk it up to one of those things that I haven't accomplished. That's not true. Let's see. I wanted to have enough money saved up for a condo by now, that's a fail. I wanted to be married by now, fail. I wanted to go to New Zealand by now-- Okay. Okay. Hefty goals. But don't worry. Don't give up, 'cause I have a plan for you and his name is Craig. Like-- like a setup? No, Meg. You know, odds of failure are very high. I know, but he's perfect! He's handsome, he's sweet, he's a single dad-- He's divorced? His wife passed away two years ago. But he was sad too for a little while and Tony said he's doing great now. Driver: Hey, there. Plus, he's an amazing dad. And you're gonna have time to figure that out because you're gonna hang out with him all week 'cause he's the best man. I don't know. Honestly, he's perfect. He's a go-getter, just like you. You know what? We'll-- we'll see. Okay? I mean, it is an ice hotel. It is kind of-- Well. --romantic. Oh my gosh! That's what I'm gonna do! I'm gonna write a story about an ice castle! This is what I love about you. You never really give up. I know. Come on, let's go. Let's do this. I wonder how far the hotel is. I've heard the scenery is beautiful! ♪ (gasping) What?! (laughing) Wow! It's real! Meg: What do you think? I think it's like something out of a fairy tale. I know. And I get to have my happily ever after in it. Ice! (laughing) Full ice everywhere! (laughing) What a piece of art this is! I think it's like a circus theme. Cool. Yep. 'Cause all of it has-- There's art everywhere you look! It's stunning. Look at this wall. I love this wall. Welcome to the Ice Hotel! Thank you. And you are? The Walshes. The Walshes. Yes, the wedding party. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm Peter, the concierge. Our bellmen will be happy to show you your rooms. Oh, perfect! We'll see you at dinner. Yeah! Do you think I could take a bit of a tour before I go to my room? It'd be my pleasure. Just follow me. Thank you. Every year the hotel is built from scratch. Well, snow and ice really. And the sculptures and themes change every year. How long does it take to build all this? Oh, about two months, including the two weeks artists spend carving sculptures and transforming the hotel into a totally unique temporary piece of art. (breathlessly) Wow. Little girl: Woo-hoo! Look at this, Dad! (giggling) This is so fun! We have a lounge which is heated, and if you like your drinks cold, but I mean really cold, all our drinks are literally served on ice. What?! Man: Sara. Hey, hey. Kids just love it here. I bet. Let's go! Man: Slow down. This way. This is crazy! (chuckling) Wow. ♪ We have 45 rooms, each designed with a different theme. You'll be staying in what we like to call the polar room. (chuckling) Oh, my. This is amazing! Look at my bed! It's even made of ice. And my very own stove. It's not gonna melt anything, is it? I should hope not. So, if you have everything you need, I'll leave you to get settled. I do! Thank you so much. Enjoy. (whispering) Wow. What? An ice slide? Yay! Yes! Ooh! Wow. Okay. Woo! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh! Whoa! Here. Wow! Oh my goodness. Here, let me help you. That was quite the run. Thank you! Um, have you tried this? No. No, we're just checking in. Well when you do, make sure you try a lot. Okay. All right, come on, let's go. Nice meeting you. (clearing throat) Skating, dog sledding? (gasping) Carriage rides! Do they have tobogganing? Yeah. You know what, it says right here they have some of the biggest tobogganing hills around which means you kinda gotta do it. (gasping) Can we, Daddy? Well, when in Rome-- Oh! Have you ever been there? The people, the architecture, the food! I gotta say, I love this enthusiasm. Daddy, did you remember to send Tony's tie to his room? I did, yes. And thank you for reminding me. Oh, are you here for the wedding? Yeah. I'm Jenny, I'm the maid of honour. I'm Meg's sister. Oh, no way! I'm the best man. I'm Craig. This is my daughter Sara. You're the best man. Yeah. Uh, pleasure to meet you, Jenny. You too. What are you gonna sign up for? Uh, oh! Well, anything I can, really. I mean, carriage rides. Who can say no to carriage rides, right? Something tells me you don't say no to too much. Well, why would you? The more you say no to the more you miss out on. Huh. Well, we have to get ready for dinner, but, um, we'll see you around. Yes, you will. Bye! (gasping) (whispering) Okay, you were totally right. He is handsome. And kind and his little girl is so cute! (whispering) He's a catch! Yes, you had a good plan. Little girl: Hi, Jenny. I think I just hitched Jenny up with the man of her dreams. And who's that? Oh, you know, just your best man. Or should I say "best catch". But the best catch invited a plus one. Oh, no! When? I didn't think it was a big deal. I got Jenny all psyched about it! Who is it? Who's the plus one? Come here, come here. You think we'll need to sleep with a hat on? I think it's a good idea but you know what? In this cold, we're all gonna sleep like hibernating bears! Hey. Hey! Ah. How was your flight? It was good! I'm just really happy to be here. You look nice. Craig: Thank you. (whispering) I don't know. Who is that? Lana, I just-- I want to introduce you to Jenny. She is the maid of honour. Oh. Hello! It's very nice to meet you. Sorry my hands might be a little cold. I'm not too sure what's more frigid- the outside or the hotel! Oh, it's the outside, actually. Yeah. The hotel stays at a solid 23 degrees Fahrenheit or -5 degrees Celsius to be exact. Ooh. Oh, it's a good thing I brought my sun lamp! You know, we could all use some extra vitamin D. So, it's-- Oh, look. She needs me. She seems nice. Yeah. Oh, uh, Lana, this is Tony. He's the groom. Oh, hi! This is the most original wedding I've ever been to. When I found out the destination, I knew I just had to come. We're just gonna go sit down. (sighing) So sorry. It's no biggie. Guys, I didn't even get my hopes up. Tony, seriously, you have to do some reconnaissance. Hm? Tony, you do not need to play detective. I'm good. We're good! It's-- Cool, cool. Exactly. It's cool. It's cool! Mom! Dad! Hey. Hi! You made it! We did. Yeah! But I'm glad we took the later flight just to make sure I had everything. Yeah, including our best winter thermals. Oh, you are gonna need those. And don't be hogging the sleeping bag, Dad. Oh, he'll be out in the cold if he does! (chuckling) So, did you meet him? Who? Tony's best man Craig. Well, Meg didn't quite do her homework because Craig brought a plus one. Oh. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Onto the next adventure. Tomorrow I go cross-country skiing. Nice. So I'm gonna get some sleep. Okay. All right, we'll see you in the morning. Yeah, love you. Good night, sweetheart. Lana: You and Sara have a good sleep. Thanks, you too. Night. (reciting story in head) Once upon a time, in the far reaches of the north, there was a snowy kingdom with a castle made of ice whose walls told stories of the people and animals who lived in the kingdom. This is one such story. Can I give you this? Thank you so much. Lana: Hi! Hi, excuse me. I know that this is an ice hotel. I guess I just wasn't expecting it to be so cold and I thought the rooms were gonna be warmer, and-- Craig: Everything okay? Yeah! Everything's fine! I'm just asking for another blanket. Oh! Oh, I hope you're not too cold. No, I'm fine! Okay. All right, well, good night. Good night! (chuckling) Can you please get me two extra blankets and a hot water bottle? ♪ You're an early riser. Yeah, always. Do you wanna join us? Yes. Thank you. Daddy says you have to seize the day. You know what? That's my motto too! So, how did both of you sleep? Oh, we slept like a couple hibernating bears, didn't we? Except I really wish hadn't forgotten to bring my storybook. In the scramble of trying to catch the flight here, I... I kind of forgot Sara's books. You could always make something up. I'm not really great at that. Last night he did start telling me a story about a polar bear. Oh, keeping with the bear theme. I like it! How did it go? There was this polar bear. Mm-hm. His name was Snowball. Nice. And he was looking for his family. And then-- Daddy fell asleep. No! Mm-hm. Dad. You know what? I bet I know what happened next. So, on his way to visit his family, a great blizzard swept across the icy landscape. The wind whipped. And the snow was so thick that Snowball couldn't see where he was going. Suddenly there was a loud crack, and the ground beneath Snowball began to bob and sway. Blinded by the snow, you see, he'd walked out onto an ice flow that broke away and now he was drifting all alone through the frigid, choppy waters. Suddenly a dark fin emerged from the water. Snowball bellowed, "Help!" But he was too far from land, drifting and drifting away. And then-- What happened? Um, you know what? You're gonna have to hear later. It's called a cliff-hanger! (groaning) Hey. How did you sleep? Lana: Very well. Right. Uh, right-- there is my sister. So, I should go. Um, but you know what? I promise I'm gonna finish that story later, okay? Mm-hm. Okay. Um, have a great day, guys. Bye! Bye, love. Hey. Is everything okay? No. I lost my bridal veil. What? I know, what if we forgot it? If we left it at home or the plane or the shuttle with the luggage. You know what? I'm sure that it's gonna show up. Somebody will turn it in. Even if it doesn't, we can find one in town. I'm sure of it, okay? Now I have to go 'cause I'm gonna miss my ski group but I will find you and help you later! Okay. Keep moving your arms and legs like you're walking. Whoop! I'm okay! I'm good! I got-- I got this. Oh. Okay. (breathlessly) Okay. I got it. Okay. (shutter snapping) Okay. Post and share. Hey, guys? Uh-- Guys, wait up. I'm coming! (panting) Okay. I'll just follow the tracks. Follow the tracks. When in doubt, go right. Okay. No more. (panting) (gruff breathing) (whispering) Oh, please don't be a bear. Please don't be a bear, please don't be a bear. (bird squawking) Oh! Wah! You guys! (gasping for breath) I thought I heard a bear! I'm so happy to see you. Bears? Uh-- You don't have to worry, sweetheart. There's no bears in this forest. Actually I read that there are bears and foxes and wolves in here. Uh, but, you know, I read the wrong thing all the time, so. Daddy, I'm so scared. No, it's okay, there's nothing to be scared of. The bears are hibernating. But we're so far from the hotel. I bet you've seen The Wizard of Oz, right? Mm-hm. It's one of my favourites. Me too. What do Dorothy and her friends do when they're scared walking in the forest? Um, they sing? Exactly, so why don't we sing our way back to the hotel? I sang in the school choir. That's perfect! What are you singing right now? Um, "She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain". I know that one. (chuckling) Here, let me take your skis. Thank you. Take it away! ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ Sara: Toot, toot. ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ Toot, toot! Come on, Cowardly Lion! Sing with us! I'm not afraid. Oh, of wolves or the singing? ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ Whoa, back! ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ Oh! Whoa, back! ♪ She'll be driving six white horses ♪ ♪ She'll be driving six white horses ♪ ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ Meg: Look, you know you have to talk to Craig and see how serious it is with Lana. He invited her to a wedding. It seems pretty straightforward to me. No. Nothing is straightforward in any relationship. You need to dig a little deeper. (chuckling) How? Ask questions, the right questions. Ask the right questions. Right, right, right. That was so much fun! And snowshoeing, it wasn't hard at all! (chuckling) And look- we made it back safe and sound. Do you really think those tracks are bunny tracks? I think so but I'm not sure. You know what? With that picture your dad took on his phone I think you could ask somebody here at the hotel. Oh- you know who would know? Peter, the concierge. Can I, Daddy? Okay, you take this in, ask Peter, and I'm gonna return your snowshoes, okay? Thank you. All right. See ya later. Sara: Bye! (sighing) Well, thank you for saving me. And I'm so sorry about the bear thing. It's okay. And actually, this turned out to be a lot of fun. Yeah, it did. Um, how come Lana didn't come? Uh, Lana booked herself a sauna and a massage. I don't think she's enjoying this winter weather as much as she thought she would. It's not for everybody. I love it, though. Especially after a fresh snowfall. Oh, when the snow is still sitting on the branches and everything is white and magical. You know what they say, it's not the circumstances that create the joy- it's you. That's so true. Mm-hm. Okay, well I, uh, I'm gonna go check on Sara, make sure she found out her mystery tracks. Yeah. Good luck. You want these? Here, yeah, I'll trade ya. Okay. Got it. Got that? Whoop, jeez. Whoop. Got 'em. 'Kay. All right. We'll see ya. Bye! Bye. Jenny! Hi! Did you find the veil? No luck. It's okay. Who needs a veil anyway? It's not like I wanted my day to be perfect or anything. Right. I'm panicking. No, no. No, you're not. And you know what? It's fine, don't worry about it. As your maid of honour, it is my job to figure it out, okay? Okay. And it's actually fine if you don't. Everything actually is perfect. Except for that whole Craig thing. Ah. By the way, I booked us a pre-wedding manicure at the local spa. Oh, when? In an hour. Okay, well, I better go get these dropped off then. See ya. See ya. Okay, maybe I'll get my nails done in red for love. Lana: Hi, ladies! So sorry I'm late. The concierge just gave me the message. I was in the sauna. I am so happy that you invited me! Oh, I'm so happy you could come. I am so happy too! My nails are a disaster. Lana! How long have you and Craig known one another? About three years now. Oh, so you knew him when he was married. Yes, I was really good friends with his wife. Oh! Um, after she passed I made a point of checking in on Craig and Sara, bringing them food, that kinda thing. That was thoughtful. It was only the right thing to do. And after a while I would stay for dinner, take Sara shopping for clothes. Wow, sounds like you were really there for them. Well, it's not a chore when you really care about somebody. So, do you see yourself in my shoes one day? You know, making it official? Lana: I think so. He hasn't asked yet, but I have no doubt in my mind that he will. Afterward we're gonna go on a quick tour of the town if you have time. Oh, that sounds so lovely! I've been away from Craig and Sara all day. It's just been me, me, me, me, me. So I think I probably should get back, but I'm gonna get a colour. (whispering) Okay, what's going on? What are you guys doing? What? I can tell when you guys are digging! Listen, we just need to get the scoop. Okay, well clearly they're in a very solid relationship. Well, I wouldn't say that. Meg! I'd say he's not sure. She might be misunderstanding the relationship. It can happen. People start as friends, get comfortable and then-- Mom, Mom. Meg, I need you both to back off, okay? He is taken. And there's no way I'm getting in between that. I found one! You think we can do that again sometime? Hang out with Jenny. I like her. She's fun. Yep. She is full of life, isn't she? You're definitely more fun around her. How so? Like today, you were singing. Well, you've heard me sing before. It's the first time since Mom passed. Lana: Knock, knock! I just wanted to check in on you two, see how you're doin'. Oh, here. Let me finish that. How was your sauna? It was great! And then the girls asked me to join them for a manicure. Was Jenny there? She was! Oh, I wish I could've gone! Oh, I didn't realize that you knew Jenny. Oh, uh, we ran into her while we were snowshoeing. She was a bit lost, so we all came back together. There you go. Thank you. Do you think Jenny could finish telling me her story at dinner? Oh, I actually thought that the three of us could get dinner alone. I saw the most adorable place in the village- a pizzeria, and I know how much you love pizza. All right. Let's go! Jenny: Wow, you sure don't see stars like this in the city. Clark: Oh, boy. That's for sure. Shooting star! I saw that. Make a wish, make a wish! My wish already came true. (chuckling) Hey, my man! Where you been? We went into town for dinner. Lana: Yeah, just the three of us. I got this at the market! It's so cute. Do you know if they had any with tigers on them? I love tigers. And did you know that in Taiga they have the world's biggest tigers? And the people that live on the land say that if you respect the tigers, the tigers will respect you back. (chuckling) That sounds terrifying! Really? Oh, that sounds kinda mystical to me. I think so too. Please, join us! Yeah. The shooting stars are spectacular. You know-- Come on. --we should actually go. Daddy, please? Uh, you know, the fire looks pretty nice. There you go. Look, look! There's another one. Linda: Oh! Everyone make another wish. Your mom's getting a little sappy here. Hey. I'm fine. It's just-- I wish we could always be together like this, as a family. Makes my wish of a motorcycle seem a little bit selfish. (chuckling) What about you? What'd you wish for? I bet you it was a double patty, double cheese from Phil's. Why would you say that? Actually, I think Tony's wish is a little more sentimental than that. Thank you for the props, bud, but Meg is right. But only because-- Thank you! --like her, my wish came true. Aww. I know it sounds mushy but I wished for what you and Meg have. What about you, Craig? What do you wish for? Um... I wish for all of Sara's wishes to come true. What did you wish for, Sara? I can't say it. Why not? If I tell it to you, it won't come true. I'm with Sara on that one. (sneezing) Are you all right? Yeah! I'm fine! It's just the cold air and I-- Maybe you're getting a cold. No, I'm fine! I'm fine. (sneezing) Craig: Um-- I never get sick. Whoa, you definitely feel warm. (coughing) A good night's sleep always made my girls feel right as rain the next day. Clark and I will walk you back to your room. We should go to bed too. Come on, we'll take you. Uh, okay. Good night. Good night, folks. Yeah, we'll come to bed too. What? It's only nine o'clock! Good night! Um, there's a whole bunch of snacks waiting for you, Tony. Oh, now you're talkin'! Yeah, let's go get 'em. Night! Jenny, can you finish telling me the story now? Uh, I'm sure Jenny has things to do. No, no, I'd be happy to. I mean, if you don't mind Sara staying up a little longer. Please, Daddy? (sighing) Okay. But you gotta promise to go to bed right after. You know what? I have just the thing that's gonna ensure that you will go to sleep right after. Oh! Here you go. Warm milk... with just a touch of honey and nutmeg. Guaranteed to send you into dreamland. Mmm. Now, where were we? Snowball was stuck in the ice and there was a fin. Was it a shark? Well, the fin swam closer and closer to Snowball, until the water broke and out came-- a huge orca whale! (gasping) Snowball backed away from the edge of the ice flow and begged the whale, "Please, I'm just trying to get to my family!" Then the whale started to push the ice flow towards shore. And when he got close enough, Snowball jumped off and then from the blizzard came two giant polar bears. Who do you think it was? Um, his parents? Yes! Snowball ran towards them and the father thanked the whale. And then, the water broke again with an entire pod of orca whales! Snowball waved, "Thank you and goodbye!" and he set off with his parents, safe and sound. The end. So the whales were his family. That's right! And they knew the importance of family so that's why they wanted to get Snowball back to his. (chuckling) Wow, you-- you really are a great storyteller. Thank you. You must be a writer or something creative like that. Uh, well, if you call a children's storybook editor creative, then sure, yeah. Um, but it's not really my dream job. What about you? What do you do? I'm the director of a travel company. That is exciting. Mm-hm, well. So what's stopping you? From what? I mean, you're the one that told me the more I say no to, the more I miss out on. And clearly, you have a gift. Well, honestly I thought that, um, if I was just like an editor for a few years, maybe I'd get my shot at being a writer. Hasn't exactly worked out as planned. That along with a few other things. Like what? Well, I always really wanted to see New Zealand before life got too busy. Really? You know, actually, I've always wanted to see New Zealand myself. Although you did make a very good pitch for Taiga. (chuckling) You know what? I am actually writing a story right now. Um, it's kind of inspired by the hotel. So you never know, maybe this is gonna be my big shot. You know, I think it will. Because if dreams do come true, I imagine they have to come true here. Looks like your sleeping potion's working. (whispering) Never fails. I think we should get to bed. Of course. Come here, you. (grunting) We should head back to the shuttle. Yeah. Let's do it. (chuckling) ♪ As the shooting stars streaked across the sky, each one encapsulating the promise of someone, somewhere, realizing a lifelong dream. (sighing) (sighing) I wish I may, I wish I might... have this wish I wish tonight. My happily ever after. (sighing) Meg: How'd it go last night? You know, after we all left. It was-- it was nice. It was nice, yeah. I mean, I finished a story for Sara and-- she fell asleep on me. Of course she did. Your stories are like magic. You don't just write well for kids. You're great with them. Mm.

By myself, why? It just sounds like the kinda thing you'd do with, I don't know, someone else. Well, um... (quietly) there's this guy, um-- his name's Craig. And he's the best man and he is super nice and he has a daughter, her name's Sara. She is so sweet. And I think she really likes my stories and I really like both of them, but-- What? What's the problem? I don't really know where he's at. You know, like, with somebody else? Ah, so it's complicated. It sure it. But you know what? I'm keeping myself busy. I'm actually writing a story! Actually, that's why I called. One of the books Carrie's waiting on from another writer is coming in late, so she wants to put out something ASAP. You should send it in. Oh. Ed, my story's not ready. You don't want to miss the boat on this one. Just send in what you've got. Okay, yeah! No, I can-- I-- I'm on it. Ed, thank you for the heads up. Okay. Have fun. Oh-- keep me posted on the best man. Okay. Uh, Meg, I'm so sorry. I have to go. I have to email something but I'll meet you back here later? Oh, cool, yeah. Go. Have fun. Okay, thanks. Have fun. Oh!

She's dog sledding with Meg and Tony. That sounds like so much fun. You really have an adventurous spirit. You should consider travel writing. Well, if you need a writer, I'm, uh... very much available. I'll remember that. So what is your name, I wonder? The owner told me that this is King Richard. Ooh, that's very regal. Mmm. A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse! Shakespeare. Yeah, Richard III. Um, how is-- uh, how is Lana? I saw her this morning and she didn't seem quite right as rain. Yeah.

Yeah. And um, being here. With my family and-- seeing my sister get married. I mean, I just don't know what could be better than that. Is Sara having fun? She is having a blast. And she's got that same adventurous spirit that you do. She was a really big part of helping me get through the first few years. You know, I'm a pretty good judge of character and... I think she gets that spirit from you. That and Meg said you were a real go getter. Really? Mm-hm. What else did Meg say about me? Oh! Um-- Well, nothing. You know, we were just talking about wedding-- you know, like seating and guests and wedding stuff. Yeah, yeah. You know that's funny, because when I called to see if it was okay to bring Sara, she mentioned you as well. That is funny. What did she say about me? How well she thought that we would get along. I gotta say I, uh, I think she was right. I mean, just look at this village. It almost feels like we're in a Dickens play! You have this way of putting everything like it came right out of a storybook. (chuckling) Well, this was fun. Yeah! Thank you so much for the pastry. Oh, don't worry about it. Amazing. Thank you so much. All right. Craig: I can't believe how nice everyone in this town is! Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, they're really lovely. I know! Hi! So, how was it? Oh, it was amazing. It was like something out of a fairy tale. The town is just steeped in such history. It's so quaint! It's so lovely. Now I'm looking forward to our ride even more. Is it okay if we take Sara with us? That's perfect! I'm supposed to go meet Tony to talk about some wedding stuff. Oh, I have to meet Megan for her vows. I'm sure you could just drop her back off here when you're done. Great. Um, all right. I'll see you later. Yeah, see you later. All right, cool. Okay. Bye, guys. Bye, guys. Craig! Lana! Hi! Hey! How you feelin'? Oh, like a whole new woman. A little vitamin C and some time under my sun lamp and I'm good to go! Where's Sara? Uh, she's with Linda and Clark. They went for a sleigh ride. Oh! So I guess it's just you and me then. Oh, yeah. Um, I'm supposed to meet Tony about some stuff. I was hoping Sara could come hang out with you if I didn't get back in time and then we could all meet up together. We? Yeah, like the wedding party. Oh! Okay. Yeah, uh, I guess a few more hours under the lamp couldn't hurt while I wait for Sara. Great. Okay. Read me what you got. My dear Anthony... Keep going. That's all I have. What? I know, it's terrible. But it doesn't mean that I don't love him in a million different ways. It's just that I'm not good at this whole writing thing. That's your forte. Okay, well we can do this. Why don't you just tell me everything you love about Anthony? Oh, he always makes me smile when I'm feeling down. That's nice. And he levels me out when I'm feeling crazy, even though he does actually drive me crazy. (chuckling) Because he's my best friend. Well, why don't you just write down everything you just told me and then I'll just arrange it for you? Jen, if you would do that, you would be the best sister and maid of honour ever! Of course. Thank you. Okay, now what about you? What about me? Fine. It's always awesome hanging out with him and his daughter but it's not gonna happen. He's with Lana. Look. Tony's with Craig right now, going through wedding details. I told Tony he has to come back with answers about Craig and Lana. They're guys. They don't know how to talk and besides, did you not hear Lana's wish? I also heard Craig's wish and it had nothing to do with Lana's. Besides, what about your wish? Meg...I'm a big girl. And I refuse to stand in the way of a woman who obviously deserves to have her wish come true. (sighing) You know what you're doing for the wedding? Yeah, showing up, right? Pretty much. I think we got this-- Oh! That's too bad. Hey, um, when you and Meg were making the guest list did you, uh, you mention me to Jenny? I didn't make the guest list, man. Right. Uh, well when Meg was making it, you think she was trying to set us up? Uh, I wouldn't know anything about that. But then again, I didn't really know about Lana either. Yeah. And you shoulda talked to Meg about that 'cause she was making the guest list and whoa did I almost screw that one up. I'm sorry about that, okay? It was my bad. Just-- when Lana saw the invitation, she got so excited. And she really has done so much for us. I figured I should invite her. Right. So uh, you and Lana are-- are what? Oh! Oh, come on! Look at that! Really? That's game. (chuckling) Wanna play another one? Unbelievable. Yeah, I do. That last shot was a fluke. You kiddin' me? That was skill! (scoffing) Skill? Yeah, right. Wanna bet? Oh. You're on, buddy. Wah-hoo! You're really getting the hang of that. Jenny! I've gone about ten times already. What? Come on! This time we can go together. All right! See ya! Wh-- where are those two off to? Oh, to the top of the slide or something. Do you wanna go together on this one? Yeah. Um, so did you finish all the wedding planning stuff? Yep, got it all done. (shutter snapping) All right. Let's do it! Woo-hoo! Woo! Whoa! It's so fast! Woo! Oh, man. That gets better every time! I told you! Again? Jenny: Yes. Meg? No! I don't wanna get an ice burn before my wedding! I'll give it a try! Of course! Come on! All righty. We're gonna have to show Lana how we do it. Yeah. Right? Okay. One more time. Jenny and Sara: Woo!

I just hurt my ankle a little bit. Well here, just take my hand. Thank you. Yeah. Let's get her sitting. Sara: Lana, are you gonna be okay? It's fine. It's just a little sprain. Can you grab me that blanket? Yeah, of course. (soft piano music playing) Thank you. Oh, perfect. Here's something to get us settled in. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

Why don't I start a story and then you help me out? Okay. Okay? Once upon a time, there was a prince. And he lived in a castle in the middle of a forest. Your turn. He had lots of friends, especially a little rabbit named Sara. But he was still lonely. Dad, your turn. Okay. Um, and even though this rabbit meant the world to him, he was missing something in his life. A dog, maybe? No, Dad! A princess, of course! Of course. So he and the little rabbit took a trip to the North Pole, and found a castle made from ice. Inside was a princess, who was a really good storyteller. (chuckling) You're pretty good at this. I think you should keep going. The princess was also looking for a prince. So when the prince came, he and the princess-- and the little rabbit of course-- went and did all sorts of fun stuff together. They had so much fun that the prince asked the princess to marry him. Really? And then what happened? They lived happily ever after, of course. (chuckling) Of course. Wow, you're so good at these I think you should be the one that starts telling them at night. Dad! All right, Okay. I promise I will keep reading to you until you find your special someone. (whispering) Good night, sweetie. Good night. Meg: Where were you at breakfast? Oh, I just grabbed coffee and a muffin. Worked on your vows in my room. No, never mind the vows. I've got a debriefing from Tony. And I've got some serious news. Lana: Hey, Meg! I hear there's a surprise. Yes, there is! All I have to say is, do not give up hope! (giggling) What? Come on. Hi! Hey. Is that a hybrid? I didn't even hear it. Surprise! What is this? Tony: This is maple syrup art. Right? Yes, that's exactly it. We thought it'd be fun if we made some homemade local treats. That you can eat! Yes! Well, sounds like a good idea. Meg: So cool. Let's get started. Everyone grab a partner and grab a jar of warm maple syrup. You and me, partner. Oh-- Okay! All right, kiddo. You and me, kid! Grab that jar of warm maple syrup and you pour it over the snow and then it solidifies into candy. Can we make shapes with it? Of course. I thought it would be really fun if we all stuck to the theme of wedding, and love. So we can make a heart! On it, partner. Right? All right. Cheers. Here we go! Dig deep, okay? Okay. Meg: Tony, no! Too much! (giggling) That's good. That's good. Okay, let's go-- It's going all over your box! Nice. Ooh! Does it taste good? It's all right, yeah. Jenny: Nice. A perfect little heart.
