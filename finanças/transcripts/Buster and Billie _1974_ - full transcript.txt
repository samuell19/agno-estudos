Oh, hey Buster. Joy to the world. Hey, when you get finished playin' with yourself, can you give me a cigarette? Here you go. Thank you. You got a light? You want me to smoke it for ya too? Woohoo, is that bus driver pissed he sure is. Well I'm glad it's Friday. I had school up my ass. Yeah, you and me both. Hey Buster. You know Sally pretty well, don't ya? No, not really. Well she hangs around Margie all the time. Yeah, so what? Well she... She smiled at me this mornin' on the bus. Why don't you ask her for a date? Tonight? Sure. If you can't get your old man's car, you can double with me. You think she's purty? Sure, she's a purty girl. Don't you think so, Warren? Yeah, yeah. She's sharp, real sharp. Oh, here comes Buster. We'll see you, Buster. Hey, you look mad. What's the matter? Oh, I just failed a history exam. - Hi Sally. - Hi. well that's all right. You can make it up on the next one. Is that albino a friend of yours? Yeah, why? Well he came up to me at recess and asked me to go out with him tonight. What'd you say? Well what do you think I said? I said, "no, thank you." Buster, he's ugly. When's the last time you won a beauty contest, you hoot owl lookin' bitch? Buster! Buster! She's my best friend. I don't care, honey. I don't like that girl a'tall. Hey Whitey! Come on, I'll give you a ride. Boy, I lied to you this mornin'. I feel terrible about it. You lied to me, 'bout what? You asked me if I thought Sally was pretty and I said, "yeah." Sure hope you didn't ask her for a date. Well how come? 'Cause she ain't pretty. She looks like a damn hoot owl. Anyway, you can do better than that any day of the week, dude. Well I ain't gonna date her. That's good. Ooh, look at that bus driver. How do you do? Ooh Buster, he hates you. What are we waitin' on? Waitin' for him to get a little farther down the road. I'm gonna give him the finger. Let's get him! No no no, wait a second. Hey Buster, are you comin' to Jake's tonight before you pick up Margie? I ain't datin' Margie tonight. How come? Let's go get him. He didn't mean that, Sally. He was just mad 'cause you said Whitey was ugly. Well I'm no bitch and I don't like bein' called one. Sally, do you remember when Whitey first came to school and everybody made fun of him? Yeah? Well nobody dared to say anything once Buster made him his friend. So when you called Whitey an albino, Buster flipped. I don't care if he is Buster's friend. I'm not goin' out with him. Just because you think he's ugly? He is. Besides, that he's messing around with that crazy girl Billie Jo Truluck. A bunch of the boys from the tfa are you know, doin' it to her. Margie, you don't suppose Buster? Sally, sometimes you are ridiculous. Buster loves me. Well those guys are his best friends. Good god, Sally please. Hey Jake, you old buzzard. Gimme a beer, huh? How you doin', Buster? Comin' right up. Four to go, right? Nope, not tonight, Jake. Sheriff, you leavin' already? Yeah, gotta get back. I'm comin' in to springer tomorrow. May stop by. Do that. How you doin', Buster? Sheriff. Lucky ducky, who's next? I'll take you on, Smitty. How much you shootin' for? Are you kiddin'? I'd have to give myself one hell of a handicap, like a blindfold. Go on save your money, Phil. Later I'll shoot you a game for funsies. Hey, you loudmouth, hickey-lookin' bastard. How much money you got on ya? $23, son. Best two outta three take the cash? Sure you're on, smitt. We got ourselves a game, boys. Put me down for $2, 2.50. Big spender from the east. Okay, you got it, dude. I'm bettin' $5.00 on Buster. I ain't got but $1.00, but I'm bettin' it on Buster. You're covered too. Rack 'em up. I got my arm back. You better shoot your best shot. You better win this, Buster, or I don't eat for a week. My life is ridin' on you, Buster. What do you say? Buster, you can get it. Let's go, c'mon. Let's go. Four balls on the break. Smitty, you're dead. # cheated and you lie # well you can't win 'em all. Oh, shut up. Hey Jake, how's my credit? Anything up to $10. Well listen, get my friends here some beers, will ya? Appreciate it, Buster. C'mon, Warren. Let's get it. Now wait a minute. Hey Buster, gimme a cigarette. Well sure, Smitty. Here. There you go here, lemme light it. Listen. Well what's that for? You know, thought maybe you might wanna borrow my truck. That's real sporty of you. Thank you. Get outta here! Hey, where you guys goin'? We're gonna go get some poontang. They're goin' to get Billie Jo. They're gonna get Billie! Hey Warren, can we go with ya? Well maybe you can. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Now listen you guys can go. But just remember I'm first, Smitty's second. And one of you guys gotta go get her. All right, odd man out goes and gets her. Sure. Ready? Go. Come on, Whitey. Billie wants you. What are you waitin' on? You're not scared, are you Whitey? I ain't scared of nothin'. Sure, you're not. Don't let the boogieman get you. Boo. # anytime # # your world is lonely # boy, that song tears me up. Grandmother tells me she feels real bad about you missin' 'em two year of school. Yeah, we had a couple pretty bad, bad years. That late frost last year like to kill us. That and that goddamn rain. # that will be # Buster, I don't wanna get personal. But how come you don't take on Billie Jo with Warren and them? I'll tell you, Jake. There's two things I think oughta be private: Takin' a shit and gettin' laid. I know what you mean. And you're older than them. You're gettin' married pretty soon anyway, ain't ya? Mm-hmm, after I graduate in June. That is if I graduate. Jake's. Y'all here? Yeah. Just a minute. Hello? Well I miss you too, honey. I'm sorry too. How soon can you be ready? Buster Lane! If you don't quit drivin' like a crazy man, I'm gonna have to get out my switch! How are you tonight, Mrs. Hooks? I'm just fine. Come on in. Hello son, have a seat. Buster. Hey, I was winnin'. Margie'll be out in a minute. Yes, ma'am. Fire feels pretty good. Still cool nights. Yes, sir. It sure is Carl, I know Buster don't want any, but I'll bring you some of that fresh batch of sticky I just made. Sticky? Oh, Mrs. Hooks. I could kiss you. I been wantin' some of your sticky for weeks. I hear your dad's gettin' along okay. Yes, sir. He's comin' along just fine. How's the farm? We had a pretty good year. After that last year, that seems like a miracle. Here, Buster. Help yourself. Oh thank you, ma'am. Mmm, that's good. Could I have another piece for later? Thank you. Well I'm ready. Mama, snap this snap for me? Our little girl's all grown up. We's real proud of her, Buster. Yes, sir. She's a real lady. Come on, let's go. Where you two kids goin' tonight? I think we'll go over to springer to see a movie. Well now you two be careful and don't you dare go down to black creek. Remember that girl that got killed by the man with the hook? Oh, I think that's just a rumor. Beside, we don't go down there anyway. Night, sir. - Bye. - Y'all have a good time. Ooh, god. - I'm freezin'. - Freezin'. I'm freezin"! Me too. Hurry up, Warren. I ain't cold. You ain't never cold. Can't wait to get ahold of them jugs of hers. Get back down there and look out for the sheriff. Go on. Come on, Warren. Hurry up. Hey Warren, save some of Billie Jo for the rest of us. Fireball Lane takes the lead. Slow down, Buster. I mean it or just let me out. Where we goin'? As if I didn't know. Yep, good ol' black creek. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Love you. Love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I think I want some sugar. That's what I want. It hurts. What's the matter? I'm still sore from last week. Oh honey, I can't stand it. Let me put it in ya. No! We've waited this long. Now we have to wait 'til June. Snap this snap for me? Boy. What's the matter? Nothin', I'm all right. Boy, damn. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I just hope that article that I read in "reader's digest" wasn't right. What? Nothin... Buster, now what'd you say? All right, I'll tell ya. You see, this doctor that wrote the article said. Well he said that if a man. Said, "if a man doesn't reach a climax every time that he gets excited, then he's liable to develop kidney trouble and die young." Well I always said you can't believe everything you read. Come on, Whitey! Whitey, kiss her goodnight. We gonna leave you. C'mon, Whitey. Clean up. You're all through. Pull your pants up, Whitey. We gonna rock and roll, baby? Drink all your milk, Buster. Makes your bones strong. I declare I just can't believe a whole week has gone by. I do hope reverend Spears has a good sermon this mornin'. When you get home from school tomorrow afternoon, Buster, I want you to finish plantin' that back field. And you better save yourself some time to chop some wood too. Yes, sir. # amazing grace # # how sweet # # the sound # # that saved # # a wretch # # like me # # I once # # was lost # # but now # # am found # # was blind # # but now # # I see # # was grace # # that taught # # my heart # # to fear # # and grace # # my fears # # relieved # # how precious # # did # # that grace # # appear # # the hour # # first # # believed # Buster?

Cross my heart and hope to die. You're such a nice bus driver. One other thing. Is it gonna be a fair fight or a dirty fight? Ain't but one kinda fight. Dirty, huh? Yeah, now get outta that goddamn truck! Get him, Buster. Come on, Buster. Kick him in the ass. That fella fights dirty. He told me so. - Get off me. - That was a mistake. Get away from me. Well I do prefer a good clean fight. Sure you do. C'mon, Buster. Let's get outta here. Uh oh... c'mon, Buster. Let's go. The hell for? - C'mon. - Look over there. The girls all know about Billie.

I have a hard enough time gettin' dates as it is. Yeah, me too. You dudes worry too much. Well I tell you one thing. She's the best piece of ass I ever had. She's the only piece of ass you ever had. Shut up, you guys. C'mon, I'm gettin' horny just talkin' about her. Mmm, those tits. Nice, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Ooh yeah. Why don't you go with us sometime? Yeah, then the gang bang boys will ride again. That's for sure. Well you're talkin' to the lone ranger here. I ride alone, kemo sabe. See you guys later. - See you guys. - Mm-hmm. Boy, I hate tuna fish. I love it. Hell, one day without food and you'd be over there eatin' with the damn hogs. Come on, Phil. Let's get outta here. Where's Margie? She didn't come to school today. I think her mother took her over to the dentist in town. What I'd like to do with my books. My name's Buster. What's yours? Billie Jo. Billie Jo? That's a pretty name. Listen, how 'bout a date this Friday night? Okay. Pick you up about eight Friday? I know where you live 'cause I pass by your house and seen you waitin' on the school bus. Okay, since there's no further business, this meetin's adjourned. That was short and sweet. He's sure in a hurry. - Where's Buster goin'? - I don't know. He just hauled ass. Shit, we didn't even assign him a project. Oh, I guess you wanna see Billie Jo. - Yes, ma'am I... - Billie Jo! And don't you forget old slim is havin' a jamboree of all jamborees at the cotton warehouse out on 2nd loop road on Friday, may 14th. Yes, sir, pea pickers. Bring the whole family 'cause Claude Casey and his sagedusters'll be comin' in to pick the briars outta them old guitars. Admission is $1.00 per person and children under 12 get in free. Now me and the boys are gonna do a little pickin' for ya. One of my old favorites, "south sea storm". Run the battery down. Want a beer? No thank you. Kinda chilly tonight. Kinda nice chilly though. How you doin' in school? That bad, huh? I'm doin' all right except for math. It's just downright cold. Ain't you cold? C'mon, Rose. C'm on, 0 I' bos s \ come on, Rose. Get down there. Shut up, Whitey. You'll upset her. I was just sayin' hello. Well what'd she say? She says, "you're squeezin' my tits too hard." Oh, horseshit. Buster. Dammit. Ooh. What happened? Cow kicked over the bucket and took a leak. Kill this damn cow. Wait 'til after supper. Your ma's got the food on the table. Yes, sir. Come and get it. Oh, I like to spend the night here.

Now shut up and go to sleep. Crap. Can't get to sleep. I didn't mean to keep you awake. Oh, it's nothin' to do with you. Just somethin' I feel. Yeah, Buster. I know you. I know you like a book. Somethin's been botherin' you lately. Say, you're not mad at me, are ya? No. I get mad at you, you'll know it. Just don't feel right. What'd you say? Nothin... Nothin' at all. You know, you can't think about life, Whitey. You just gotta live it. Aw, you said it, skeebeau. You know, I got me this philosophy. I figure life is sort of like a great big juicy steak and you gotta eat it all and don't leave nothin' to waste. Hand me that pencil over there on the table, will ya? What for? 'Cause I wanna write down your philosophy. Why you always makin' fun of me? It's 'cause I like you dude. See you in the mornin'. Yeah. Yeah, see you in the mornin'. You can come back anytime, Whitey. Thank you, ma'am. I sure enjoyed it, especially your cookin'. Oh my, bless your heart come along now, Buster. Get! You're gonna be late for school. Bye, mama. Bye. Hey Buster, let's not go to school today. Let's do somethin' crazy. Oh I don't know, Whitey. Don't think I oughta miss no school. Oh. Aw, what the hell? One day ain't gonna hurt. What do you wanna do? 1 got it. Let's drive all the way to the coast. I ain't never been to the beach. You got any money? Yeah, $4.00. 32 cents. Here, how much I got? Let's see. $9.00. $9.00 and some change. Let's see, it's about 110 miles. So that's 14 into 110. That's 18 into 30. I believe we can make it there and back for about five, six bucks. Well let's do it. All right, I believe we gonna have a hell of a time. All right. That must be where the lifeguard sits. Look at that. Look at that! Shit yeah, water's always attracted me. Look at them birds. Oh, I love the beach. Shh, quiet. Hey Buster, watch out for them kids. I'll miss 'em a mile. Say, let's go wadin'. All right. I'll race ya. Wow. Hey, what's that shit over there? Jellyfish. Jellyfish? Woo. Ugly little devils, aren't they? Is it dead? I think so. There's lots of 'em washed up. Those little things'll sting the hell outta ya, paralyze ya. Sometimes they even kill ya. Well why the hell didn't you tell me that before I touched it? They can't sting you from the back, dummy. Here, I'll show you where the stingers are. You son of a bitch. Get that away from me! Where we goin' now? I don't know. Wanna go over and get somethin' to eat? Ooh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I believe I detect two gorgeous babe-a-roos. I heard a lot about them girls down here at the beach. Yeah, like what? Well like they're livin' here down at the beach and they're partyin' all the time and they'll screw any guy from outta town because they won't tell their friends. Plus there's just somethin' about them being down here at the beach that makes 'em Wilder than shit. Hey. You said gorgeous. I didn't know. Watch this. Hey girls! You wanna do it? Lemme have that green hat with the feather on it. That's a Robin hood hat. I know that. I want my name on it too, lady. What is your name? Whitey. W-h-i-t-e-y. How come you don't want your name on yours? Not on a cowboy hat. That'll be $3.00. Can't get it 'til you pay for it. You better pay the lady. Thank you. Rob from the rich and give to the poor. Stick 'em up, lady. Where's my opener? Look in the pocket for me, will ya? That's it. Yes, sir. I been known to crack a cool one now and then. Have to acquire a taste for this stuff. Just hate it at first. Hate it. Then after a hot summer day, hard work. Boy, ain't nothin' better. Sure wish you'd say somethin'. You don't have to. My daddy's real quiet too. Never talks. Broke his back last year and he never mentions it. And when my brother was killed in the war, wouldn't hardly talk about it at all. He kinda reminds me of Gary Cooper. You know who he is, don't ya? I don't think so. Ain't you ever been to the movies? Okay, honey. Chin up just a little bit, little to your right. All right, big smile. Okay, next. Okay, Mole. No gum chewin'. Big smile, son.

Say Buster, could you pick me up? Sure, how bout 12:30? Righto. See you later. I thought you were gonna go see your grandma this Saturday. Oh, I am honey. Just goin' later 'bout 6:00. That is if it's all right with you. I can't even ask a question anymore. Hey honey, let's not fight anymore. What you wanna to do tonight? You mean I have a choice? Sure. Anything you wanna do is all right with me. Anything? Don't you ever think of anything else? Sure, food. Margie, whatcha doin'? I'm just fixin' Buster a sandwich, mama. Oh, hello Buster. Don't talk so loud you'll wake your daddy up. Okay. Anyway, I've asked Sally to be my maid of honor if that's all right with you. Sure. That's all right, honey. Think I'm gonna ask Whitey to be my best man. Okay. I'm so excited. I can't wait "til June. You know, mom and daddy really like you a lot. Well I'm glad. I'm full. Guess I wasn't as hungry as I thought. Well. Got chores in the morning. Guess I better go. Put it right there, Buster. All right, Buster. Put it across. Let's go. - Time out! - Right there, Buster. Time out? - What is this? - What is this? They're ahead. But I really think we got 'em worried now. Yeah, what's the score now? 23 nothin'. You just hang in there, big fella. Hang in there. That's good. Y'all hurry up out there. C'mon. Let's do it, Buster! Put it anywhere, Buster. Anywhere at all. I'll knock it clean outta the damn pasture. C'mon. C'mon, knock it outta the field. C'mon, let's go. - C'mon. - All right. Hello knothead that ain't funny. I think he meant to hit me. Nah, I know Buster. He's just tryin? to scare you. Hey. C'mon, I got some medicine for ya. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? Whitey. Let's see where they're goin'. C'mon. Where do you guys think you're goin#? - Nowhere. - Aw, come on. The more the merrier. C'mon. Let's go, c'mon. Hey, what's this stuff? It's stump hole. - Aw, yeah? - Yeah, it's stump hole. Get down, get down. C'mon, man. Lemme try, c'mon. He's sick. I think Phil stopped breathin'. Say somethin', say somethin'. Help me! That Phil's gettin' to be a real man. Put your head down 'tween your legs. C'mon, c'mon. I'm okay now. I feel better already. Yee-haw, let's go get Billie. - Woo! - C'mon. I know it ain't funny. But when that softball hit him in the head, he looked like he was out cold standin? on his feet. All I meant to do was make him hit the dirt. I got a smile out you anyway. Your hair sure looks pretty tonight. Wanna try some? All right. Eww. - Eww. - Don't like it, huh? Tastes like soap. Here, got that just for you. One of these days you're gonna fall out the damn truck. - Here he comes. - Mole. C'mon, Mole. Hey, where's the bitch? She wasn't there. Not again. You're lyin'. You just turned chickenshit. No, I swear. That old witch just screamed out, "she ain't here." Get in the car. This pisses me off. Hey, you wanna go shoot a game of pool? Can you drive? Does a wild bear shit in the woods? Must be after 12. Sunday mornin' already. How come I never see you in church? - Goodnight, Billie. - Goodnight. You wanna go to church with me tomorrow? Yes. I'll pick you up at 10:30. It's Buster. I wonder what he's doin' here this time of night. Oh my, I hope nothin's happened to his grandmother. Buster, is that you? Yes, ma'am. It's me. Are you all right? Has anything happened? Oh no, ma'am. C'mon in, c'mon in. I'll wait out here. I'm sorry to wake you up, ma'am. But I need to talk to Margie. It's very important. Oh. All right. I'll go get her. Come on in. No, ma'am. I'll wait out here if it's all right. Okay, I'll go get her. What happened? Is your grandmother all right? Sit down here. I wanna talk to you. First of all, everybody's okay. I mean there's nobody hurt or nothin'. I just came here to talk about you and me. If you're drunk... Margie, I ain't drunk. I came here to talk about us. It's 1:00 in the mornin', Buster. My parents are gonna ask me what you came here for. What am I supposed to say, you came here to talk about us? No, I can do better than that, Margie. You and I are through. I'm breakin' up with you. Honey, that's why I come out here. I never wanna see you again as long as I live! Why don't you let me explain? Get outta here! Just get outta here! Margie, what happened? What happened, baby? Well I couldn't say anything before, but I sure can now. Margie, he's a crude person. He's the kinda man who would beat up his wife. I'm glad that you broke up with him. Yes, well I guess it's a good thing I found out in time. Look! Mornin', reverend. Glad to have you in church today. I don't believe it. Reverend Spears, I'd like you to meet Ms. Billie Jo Truluck. Certainly a pleasure to meet you Ms. Truluck. Welcome to our church. Are you new here? Reverend, Billie's folks aren't churchgoers. Well Billie here's gonna become a regular member, that is if she likes your preachin'. Oh. Well it's time to go in now. I'll see you folks after church and welcome to the house of the lord. # would my tears for # # ever flow # # could my zeal # # no langour know # # these for sin # # could not atone # # thou must save # # and thou alone # # in my hand # # simply to # # thy cross I cling # # while I draw this # # fleeting breath # # when my eyes # # shall close in death # wee! Are you ready? Fireball Lane's death ride. Can you take it? Let's go. Boy, girl. If I ever get in a fight, I sure want you on my side. - You all right? - Yeah. Mama, what y'all doin' up? Me and your mama wanna talk to you, son. Yes, sir. Now Mr. and Mrs. Hooks was over the other night. Oh, I knew it. Don't interrupt me, son. I'm sorry. They said you was over at their house last night at 1:00 in the mornin' drunk. Well that ain't true. Then you started yellin' at Margie. Now son, that hurt me and you mama real bad. Daddy, you and mama always told me that marriage was well just to make real sure you love the one you're gonna marry. And daddy, I don't love Margie. I guess I thought I did all this time, but I don't. And I had to tell her that last night. All right. But now what about church this mornin'? Me and your mama hear this girl you took, well she's a bad girl in your school. Don't say that unless you know. We don't mean to say anything bad about her, Buster. But girls like that need mental help. No, mama. You're wrong! Mama, she can't help it 'cause she was raised by two people who I do think need help. Not only that, but there's nobody around here that have anything to do with her. She was just tryin' the only way she knew to have somebody like her. Do you love her? I don't know, daddy. All right, son. You do whatever you think is right. Let's go to bed, babe. Nice shot. I never saw anyone play so bad, Smitty. Just a bad night. Plus you shot a pretty fair game yourself. C'mon, I'll buy you a beer. Nah, I think I'll shoot another game. Thank you anyway. Come on, Whitey. The beer's on me. I still got one, Buster. # lightnin' bar # # some people value fortune and fame # do it to me, Jake. # care about 'em none # # just wanna drink my sweet red wine # what the hell's the matter with you? I paid my bill. # have my good time fun # yeah, I know. # I don't need no diamond ring # # I don't need no # I just don't like what you did to miss Hooks' little girl. # just wanna drink my sweet red wine # # down in the lightnin' bar # especially takin' up with that... Hey, you better think real hard before you say anything else, old man. # don't cry for me # Think real hard. # place my livin', lovin', laughin' bones # in a jar of alcohol are you hungry yet? No. I'm not hungry-hungry, but I'm hungry. I guess I can wait 'til later though. Sure feels like summer, don't it? Even smells like it. Boy, a day like today makes me restless. Makes you wanna do somethin', ya know? Let's go swimmin'. We're gonna freeze. C'mon. Get ahold of it here. Hang on. 'Kay, set yourself. 'Kay, here we go. All over? Yeah. That was great. Hey, look in the side pocket there and gimme my knife. Goodbye. I been gettin' some awful weird stations lately. That speaker sounds good though, don't it? Buster? What's that, a present? Boy, I love presents. Oh, look at that. Well honey, that's really somethin'. I made it just for you. Did it take you long? No. That's nice. That's real nice c'mere, girl. Hey, pick you up at 4:30 in the mornin'. Don't you go to sleep, hear? Be right on time, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Oh, I been sick before, but this is the worst. I think he'll live. Want some? It's good for you. Oh thank you, honey. Oh misery. Honey, read me a little more of that marvel comic. "Mr. Mars, owner of station whiz enters. "You, you killed the watchman.' another intruder. Help.' 'stop your squealin'.' in his nearby office Billy batson has been workin' late. "That sounded like Mr. Mars. Shazam!" By pronouncin' the word shazam, Billy batson calls down the magic lightnin' and thunder that change him to mighty captain marvel. Holy moly, am I too late? Hey! Here, honey. They're for you. C'mon, let's go on the steps and open 'em. Read the card first. Thank you. This here's a three-part gift. After you get these two open, there's a third one. It's so purty. Open this one. It goes with it. Mama told me what sizes to buy. But if they don't fit, we can take 'em back tomorrow afternoon 'cause the third part of the gift is tomorrow night. We're goin' to the slim mims jamboree. # now every night I go to bed # # she is there in my dream # # all I do is think of cows and chickens # # now let's sing # # cluck cluck # # moo moo # # cockadoodilidoo # # I'm crazy 'bout hillbilly gal # # now every night I go to bed # # she is there in my dream # # all I do is think of cows and chickens # # now let's sing # # cluck cluck # # moo moo # # cockadooilidoo # # I'm crazy 'bout my hillbilly gal # # crazy 'bout my hillbilly gal # Thank you. Thank you so much. And now ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Slim Mims. All right! Glad to be here. Say you know, that was a wonderful number. Thank you so much. Glad to have so many of you here tonight. It's a financial pleasure. You know what I seen tonight when I came in outside? There was a car parked right at the entrance and there was a girl and a boy in the back seat and they were playin' checkers. I know they were playing checkers because the girl said somethin' about, "if you make another move like that, I'm gonna crown ya." I went home to see ma the other day and she was wantin' to fix dinner. Of course I had to go down to the pond and get a bucket of water. I run down to the pond to get a bucket of water. Just as I reach down to get the water, a great big alligator was in that pond. I throwed the bucket down, run back up to the house and ma says, "where's the water?" I said, "it's in the pond.? she says, "how come?" I says "ma, there's an alligator in that pond. She says, "aw, go on down there and get the water. You probably scared him bad as he did you." I said, "ma, if I scared him bad as he did me, that water ain't fit to drink." Aw, thank you. But I know you came tonight to hear that boy that really sings some pretty songs. In fact, he's wrote many of 'em. And tonight, he's gonna do one of his newer ones for ya. Here's Claude Casey and the sagedusters doin' for ya their newest number "long lonesome road". Let's give 'em a hand! Wanna dance, Billie? I can't. Sure, you can. C'mon, I'll show you. # Road to Tampa # just make a box. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. # You like it when I cry # # so I'm traveling # # this lonesome road unknown # # it'salong # # lonesome road to Tampa # # after # # your love's proved untrue # # my heart lies broken # # when you said you didn't love me # # so I'm traveling # # this lonesome road so blue # C'mon, honey. Let's go get some air. I'll take two please. There you go. Thank you, ma'am. There she is. Go after her, buddy. - Go, go! - Get 'er, Warren. C'mon, here we go. - Woo! C'mon, Billie! - Billie! Get her, Mole! Get her, Mole. Yeah, get her. Okay, bitch. We've played long enough. I ain't Buster. Don't hurt her, Warren. Goddamn bitch! All right, take it easy! Don't worry. She's all right. She's just out cold. She ain't here. 'Kay, thank you, ma'am. He's chokin' her! Mole, Mole! Get him. Get off. Come on. Oh my god, I think she's dead. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! All right, listen to me and listen close, all of you. It was an accident. Nobody meant to do it. Probably won't find her for a couple days. They'll figure it was one of them hook man killin's. Smitty, you get a tree limb and brush away all the tracks. It's rainin' hard. That's good. I'll drop each of you off at home. Mole, fix your face yourself. Think of something later that coulda happened to ya. We'll meet at Jake's in half an hour. Let's go. The hell is everybody? Hey, I asked you a question. I told you I ain't seen 'em, Buster. Billie? Billie? Billie? Billie? Billie? Billie! Oh no! No! Cut it out Jake. # It'salong # # lonesome road to Tampa # # when you # # are travelin' # # all alone # # you cheated # looks like you got caught out in the rain, Buster. # you lie # # you laugh when I cry # # so I'm traveling # # this lonesome road unknown # # it'salong # # longsome road to Tampa # C'mon, Buster. I'll shoot you a game? And I got the winner. Well looks like we got a game goin' here, boys. Yeah. # heartbroken # # when you said you didn't love me # you wanna break 'em, Buster? # this lonesome road so blue # # it'salong # Leave before he kills us all! Shit! The hell's goin' on down there? Buster! What the hell's goin' on down here? Oh my god. Oh my god. Buster? What's that? That is neeson Moore building another bed in that cell the Lane boy was in. He sure tore up that cell. I'll tell ya somethin'. If I was in his shoes, I don't know what I'd do if somebody raped and killed my girlfriend. Yeah. Why didn't you let him out yesterday? Least so he could go to the girl's funeral. Her parents didn't even go. Wasn't anybody there but Mr. and Mrs. Lane and the preacher. I couldn't do that, son, under any circumstances. Two boys dead and bail wasn't set 'til this mornin... He sure tore outta here. Didn't even stop and talk to his daddy. Sheriff's department. Yes, ma'am. I see. We'll check it out. That's funny, somebody dug up all of Mrs. Pendoris' flowerbeds. - Mrs. Pendoris? - Well you know her. She owns the nursery. Sheriff's department. What's your address, Mrs. Megs? I see. Yes, ma'am. We'll check it out. Somebody tore up Mrs. Megs whole front yard. # I never dreamed # # you'd mean a thing to me # # but when I needed your lovin' # # you gave me lovin' the way oughta be # # sweet country days # # my memories are clear # # and I remember the laughter # # sure miss the laughter # # I had when you were here # # and when I feel the way I'm feelin' # # can't help believin' you # # made it so easy # # they can't take that away # # the girl you were # # the girl you used to be # # and I have heard all the stories # # you know the stories don't mean a thing to me # # I love your face # # I love your quiet ways # # if I could paint you in colors # # you'd be a rainbow # # on a summer day # # and when I feel the way I'm feelin' # # can't help believin' you # # made it so easy # # they can't take that away #
