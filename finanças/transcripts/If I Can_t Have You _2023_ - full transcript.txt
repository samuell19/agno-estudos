I asked you not to call me again. No. You need to respect my boundaries. You always mean a lot to me too, but I need my space. I need to figure some things out on my own. No, I'm sorry. Don't stop by. We don't have anything else to talk about. Don't even call or text. I'm sorry, but we're through. ♪ If I can't have you ♪ How can I go on? ♪ If I can't have you, then here's my song ♪ ♪ If I can't have you... Asleep in the hospital. My hand in hers. And when I woke up, she was gone. How long had you been married, Glenn? Twenty-one years, six months, and two weeks, to the day. Bless you. Glenn, I'd like to leave you with one of my favorite Tennyson quotes tonight. "It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all." In honor of Glenn and Patricia's enduring union, let's play a little song about timeless love by Mitchell Sachs and the Deerfield Five. Ugh. Oh, that was heavy. Is it bad that I sometimes prefer the pathetic losers to the hopeless romantics? Yes. One of your favorite Tennyson quotes? Had you even heard of Tennyson before today? You know, some of us actually went to college, Keith. Ouch. You headed home after this or you wanna grab coffee? I don't know. Let's play it by ear. Yeah. See how tired I am. Mm. I did get last week's ratings from Stan though, at one point we should discuss. - Bad? - Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. In fact, we're slightly up in some demos. - Hmm. - No, it's just been a while since we discussed the numbers together. - Yeah. - Yeah. On in 10, Michelle. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... Welcome back to "Heart of the Night" on Polaris Satellite Radio. So, bottom line is what? We don't know anything. No, no. We know quite a bit. What we don't know is what it all means. Uh, some people love listening to callers. Some people love listening to you give advice. And, well, some people think you're full of it. - And some people... - Okay. - Think... - Oh, okay. I get it. What does Stan say? Oh, Stan just loves reminding me that he's not a producer. He's a station manager. Yeah. He wants me... well, he wants us to review it and give our recommendations. And I guess that's what he considers managing. - Bastard. - Yeah. Okay. I got this. - Really? - Yeah. Can you stay a little bit? I can't, I promised Aiden. Promised him what? That I would try to get home before he left for work. Hmm. Trouble in paradise. No. No, not really. He's just been on my case about how much time we're spending together. Ugh. Wait. He knew you were a DJ when you first started dating. He knew you were a DJ when you guys moved in together. And you'll still be a DJ when you guys get married. When we get married? Isn't that part of the plan? Hmm. Then what's the point of living together? - Hmm. - Hmm. I'm not sure if that's a healthy relationship, doctor. Well, I'm not a doctor. I just play one on the radio. Damn it, Aiden. Not the warm welcome I was hoping for, but we can work with it. Okay. I've been home for two seconds. - You're already pawing at me. - Pawing you? No, sorry. I, um, no, I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. It's been a really long day at work. I had to meet with Lily about some stuff, so. Okay. But you're home now? Yeah. I really need to shower. Ugh. Can I join? Please? Okay. So Stan, to what do we owe this honor? Well, there has been talk. - Talk? What talk? - No, talk. Oh, Stan cut The BS. We're busy. What would you ladies say to moving your show to the mornings? Yay. We're already on the mornings. No, regular people mornings. 7:00 to 11:00. I like our time slot. I'm used to it. Yeah, we're vampires. Well, the show would be the same. You just have a different time slot. I don't understand. We just saw the numbers. They're good. Too good, that's the problem. It's huge concern that your talent is being wasted from midnight to 4:00. I mean, it is weird hours. Come on. It's apples to oranges, Stan. I mean, you move us to mornings, we go up against sports news, traffic, weather. - Look, I get it, kiddo. - Oh, don't call me kiddo, - it's not 1985. - Oh, please. Are you asking us or telling us? Michelle, you're the most popular host on the channel and we wanna keep you happy. So, right now we're asking. Hmm. But that could change. Just think about it. Okay? Hmm. Have a great show, ladies. What was that about? There was a time I would've killed for mornings. Michelle, we've built something here. Something real. Listeners depend on us. Yeah, I know, I know. I was just, just saying. Look, you're the star. It's ultimately your decision. Do not get me that, Lil. We're a team. You know that. I know, but I also know I'm replaceable and you're not. So think about it. Make a decision so we can be a united front. I really like what we've built here. I do, too. Is that the voice of the night in the flesh? You stalking me, Robert? It's just one of the benefits of being neighbors. You never know when you're gonna run into me. Hmm. Lucky me. If you'll excuse me, I had a really long and tiring show. I know. I heard. I have to keep a prize to the competition, especially when the competition is such a perfect fit for Clear Cell. We've had this conversation before, Robert. I'm really happy at Polaris. And you'd be happier at Clear Cell working for me. What makes you so sure? More exposure, more freedom, more money. It doesn't even matter, I have a contract. And contracts are made to be broken. I have a whole team at Polaris. They mean more to me than anything you could offer. Great, so bring them with you. Why are you pushing this so hard, Robert? You know, most hosts would be flattered. Well, I'm not most hosts. We're beating Polaris in the morning drive. We're beating you in sports, news, traffic, weather. The only spot we're lagging is nights. Like I said, I'm really happy where I am. Think about it, Michelle. It's only your future. That was "Self Control" by Laura Branigan. Now let's take some calls. Those switchboards are lighting up or whatever passes for switchboards in the 21st century. Good evening. You're on "Heart of the Night." - Hello. - Hello. Floor is yours, my friend. I listen to your show all the time. And we appreciate that. What do you wanna talk about tonight? Love. Well, you picked the right show for that. What's your name? John, as in John Doe. Fair enough, John. You said you wanted to talk about love. - What about? - I'm in love. Hmm. You're one of the lucky ones. Tell me, John, does she know? She knows it, but she doesn't reciprocate. Ah, unrequited love. - It's the cruelest kind. - What should I do? Well, John, it seems to me that you need to convince her. Don't just tell her how you feel. Show her. - Be the man she wants you to be. - Yes. Yes, I will. Thank you. I'll tell you what, John. I'll play one for you and your Roxane. - Thanks for calling. - Thank you. That was weird? - What? - That caller. I've heard worse. Hmm. Hey. Hey. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. No. That's okay. I have to be up soon anyway. Not for a couple hours. How was work? You know, when I got home, Mr. Sklar was awake. - What? - Mr. Sklar, our new next door neighbor. No. I know who he is, I just don't know what you're talking about. Just now, when I came in, I could see him behind his blinds. So what? So, it's too early. You don't think that's kinda strange? - We're up. - We have a reason to be up. Maybe he does too. What? No. I don't think he even works. I've hardly ever seen him leave the house. I don't know, Michelle. Maybe he can't sleep. Maybe he has an appointment. Who cares? I don't know. It was just, just weird. He's weird. But it's none of our business and it's not really a big deal. Go back to sleep. I'll be in there soon, okay? Uh-hmm. Your boyfriend? Oh! Mr. Sklar, I, um... you scared me. Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's from Aiden. He likes to surprise me every now and then. I have a surprise for you. Your cholesterol is under control. The test results. It's open. Of course, how would I know the results? It came to my mailbox, of course I opened it before I realized and when I saw, I thought I never went to a gynecologist. Okay. Uh, well, thank you. I got to get going. My coffee's brewing, so... French vanilla, one cream, two sugars? The other day, I was standing behind you in line. You didn't see me. Okay. Uh, I gotta go. So... Hey. Hey. I just woke up. Are you at work? Um, at work. Not really working. Well, I just wanted to thank you. Okay. That was very sweet. - What was? - The rose. What rose? - You didn't bring me a rose? - When would I have time? I went back to bed for an hour, I took a shower and then I went to work. Aiden, I have to go. Wait, wait, wait. Who brought you a rose? I really have to go. - Michelle? - Uh-hmm. I think it's that caller again. That weird one from yesterday. - John Doe? - You want me to put him through? The phone number. What is it? It's blocked. - Put him through. - Okay. That was "Lovin' For the Moment" by The Submarines. Now let's get to those phones. See what our dedicated listeners are up to tonight. Hello, you're on Heart of the Night. Hello, Michelle. - Hello. And who is this? - I think you know. Listen, my friend, I take over a hundred calls per show, so you may have to refresh my memory. - It's John. - Hello, John. What do you wanna listen to tonight? John Doe. I showed her. Come again, John? I showed her. I showed her how I felt. What can I play for you, John? Play "If I Can't Have You." Okay. Here it is. How did you like the rose? Excuse me? I said, how did you like the rose? I wanted to thank you for the advice. Hence, the rose. Here's "I Can't Have You" for John. What the hell was that about? This morning or afternoon, when I woke up, there was a red rose at my door. It wasn't Aiden? No. It was him. It was the caller, Lily. You heard him. Like he said, maybe he just wanted to thank you? It was at my home, Lily. - My home. Not the station. - Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, no. You're right, you're right. And there was a note. A note? What'd it say? For love. Hey. - You wanna get some food? - I can't. I gotta get home. - Aiden? - Uh-hmm. Well... - Lily. - Hmm? What is it? Um, no. It's probably nothing. But? But, uh, you know that caller, John Doe. He called, um, 20 minutes after he was on the air. What did he say? Well, he explained who he was, I mean, as if I didn't know, and then he proceeded to ask for your cell phone number. It's like the way he said it, you know, it was like... it was like almost a completely reasonable request. Like he expected me to give it to him. What did you say? Oh, I said unfortunately I don't give out personal information about our hosts. And then he wanted me to give you another message. What message? He said, "I'll be watching you." Hey. What are you doing up? Well, I took a nap after work so that we could have a couple hours together. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Tough day at work? How was your day? Fine. Let me get you here. Maybe I can help you with that? Huh? Hey! - Mm. Oh, you smell good. - Mm, I needed a shower. Baby, what is it? It's nothing. We finally get some time alone together and you're being so distant. Just hold me. Yeah. Thanks for taking the time to meet with us, Stan. I know you wanna get home. For you, sweetheart, anything. Look, about the other day. I was just gauging how you felt. If you're comfortable with nights... No, that's not why I wanted to talk to you. Okay. What was it then? Michelle is being harassed. Harassed. Oh, okay. Uh, I'm sorry. Okay. We have policies in place for this. We need to contact human resources immediately - and document... - No, not by somebody in the company, Stan. Well, then who? A caller. Caller. Dirty talker? No, not a dirty talker. He's actually rather polite. Um, after he was on the show, he called back and he wanted her number. - For? - What difference does it make? Well, as the host of a popular radio show, it's really not surprising. Michelle has loyal listeners who identify with her, especially... considering the nature of the show. Whoa, are you saying that it's her fault? I'm saying no such thing, Lily. Come on. What I'm saying is that it certainly is no surprise that one of her, shall we say, less stable listeners, might develop a crush on her. And might think it's perfectly acceptable to call. You know? "Hey Michelle, I know you. Let's talk." Well, is there anything we can do about it? Anything we can do about it? I mean legally? Practically? Technologically? I don't... I don't know what you're asking. I guess I don't know either. Look. The bottom line is that Michelle feels unsafe. As the station manager, you gotta do something. Oh, man. Michelle, all I can offer you is someone every evening walks you safely to your car. That's fine. I'll be fine. God. I would hate to be a woman. What an ass. What'd you want him to do? Hmm. You okay? Okay, let's get ready for the show. It's been nearly five years since she walked out. Five years. And it doesn't get any easier. - You miss her every day. - I do. James, I hear you. Love hurts. That's not just a lyric. But you owe it to yourself to move on. You deserve to be happy. - I know, I know. - Okay. Let's take another caller. Tony, you're on Heart of the Night. Tony? It's not Tony. Okay. Well, let's play another song then. ♪ I'm taking one step... How long do we have until we're back on the air? Uh, you got 15 minutes, at least. I'll play four or five songs. Keep 'em long. Stairway to Heaven of romantic ballads. Thank you. - Lily? - Hmm? What happened? He said his name was Tony. Um, said he lost his fiancee in a car accident. I mean he sounded so different than John Doe. And the phone number? Blocked. Okay. Well, we may need to consider only taking calls from confirmed numbers. The majority of our callers block their numbers. Kind of ironic, isn't it? People stream their whole lives on social media and now they're just paranoid as ever about their phone numbers. But just wanna back up a bit and tell me what's going on here. - Someone's harassing me. - On air? I haven't heard anything. You don't listen to any of the calls. True. What's he saying? It's not really what he says, it's... I don't know. Just forget it. You have any idea who it is? - Do you have a gun? - Of course not. Hey. Don't freak her out, you jerk. I'm not trying to freak her out. All I'm saying is Sig Sauer hidden in your purse might make you feel better. I'm not carrying a gun. All right. You might wanna get back. We'll be on soon. What? You don't know anything about this, do you? About what? About what we just talked about, the caller. Yeah, I know exactly what you just told me! Okay, Keith. We all know how you feel about her. Yeah, well, it doesn't really matter how I may or may not feel about her. She has a boyfriend. Besides, how could I do that? I'm sitting right here when the calls come in. I didn't say you did it. I just asked if you knew anything about it. With the implication being that I had someone else make those calls? Look I... I'm just trying to protect my friend and co-worker. - Okay? - Yeah, whatever, Lily. We're almost back on the air. Geeze I used to love our time slot. - I thought it was so peaceful. - It still is. Don't let this idiot ruin it for you. Have you thought about what Stan said about moving to days? No, not really. I'm not sure how that solves the problem. Maybe I am just overreacting. You know, I've had fans get a little too friendly before. Is that what you really think? No. No. This, it just feels different. Maybe we can go to the cops? And say what? Tell them exactly what's going on. I'm not sure I'll be their priority. I don't wanna freak you out. I mean chances are this guy is some harmless crank. Okay? I mean... - But... - But we've all heard stories where young women, they felt like something was wrong, but I mean really felt it in their gut, but didn't go to the police, because either they thought they were overreacting or they don't wanna get laughed at. I'm not gonna go to the police, Lily. I'll just take care of it myself. Do me a favor. I know you like jogging at all hours of the night, but maybe just hold off on it until this whole thing blows over. Sure. I'll think about it. Mm. Michelle, I don't wanna freak you out. I just want you to be safe. Okay. Michelle, what's wrong? Okay, let's go to the cops. Yeah. Oh. Whoo! My apologies. Been on my feet for over 12 hours. My shift is almost over. So, um, you said someone is stalking you? Yeah. I think so. I mean, yes, for sure. And you don't know this person? No. I have no idea who they are. Hmm. - What? - No. It's just that, in cases like this, the stalker generally is someone the person knows. Well, if I knew him, then he wouldn't really be a stalker. Not necessarily. It doesn't have to be someone you know well. In fact, it usually isn't. But it's someone who feels as if he has a connection to you. So like a caller? - Caller? - Well, Michelle is a radio DJ. - Oh. - A lot of people call in and this one guy, he's been freaking us out. And, you know, what does he say? The caller? He said... well, originally, he just called and talked about his girlfriend, or some woman that he loved. And that's what my show is, I play love songs and callers talk about their relationships. So then what did he say? The thing that upset you? It wasn't really what he said. It was how he said it. - How was that? - I don't know. It was strange. Don't you have a lot of people calling into your show? Yeah. So I have to imagine that some of them sound stranger than the others, yes? He freaked her out, okay? Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to understand. Um, now, Ms. Hall, you said someone's stalking you. I'm not sure a few phone calls, even if they made you feel uncomfortable, constitute stalking. He came to my house. Oh, okay. But I thought you said you never met this person? - Never saw him? - I haven't. - But he was at your house? - Yes. He left a rose by my door with a note. What did the note say? For love. And how do you know the rose is from the same person who has been calling? Because the caller said it on the air. I'm just asking. And you came here today because he vandalized your car? He left a note on my car. There's just a heart in the note. Mm-hmm. Huh. Look, isn't there anything you could do besides waiting for this guy to become dangerous? - What would you have me do? - How about some patrols - outside of my house? - Yeah. I'm sorry. For me to authorize that, I would need there to be a tangible threat. Wait. The phone calls - to the station. - Oh, yeah. He called from a blocked number, but isn't there a way that you guys can figure out where they really came from? We would have to subpoena them from the phone company. No judge would ever agree to in this situation. Okay, Michelle. Let's go. They're not gonna help us. Thanks for nothing. Ms. Hall? I'll send a squad car by for a few days just to make sure everything is okay. Thank you. Come in! You just get back? I swear, criminals in this city are getting dumber and dumber. We just picked up this guy who was hitting jewelry stores over on Willow. You know how we caught him? His credit card, his actual credit card that he used to buy something. So the store manager wouldn't feel uneasy. Oh. I need your read on something. Shoot. I just met with a woman named Michelle Hall... - The DJ? - You know her? Well, Rick listens to her show all the time. Your husband listens to a soft rock call-in show for hopeless romantics? He's a romantic at heart. He forgets your anniversary every year. I said at heart, not in brain. Anyway, this Michelle Hall, she's being creeped out by one of her callers. - I'm not surprised. - Why not? - You ever listen to her show? - Mm-mm, I never even heard of her until she came into the station. She's very sympathetic to her callers. She's very likable. Mostly, she's got this really sexy voice, you know. I mean I'd be surprised if she didn't have callers who were infatuated with her. - Is she in danger? - I don't know. I mean, she didn't strike me as the kind of woman who scares easily or who would just come into a station unless she didn't think something was wrong. - Give me some background. - Okay. Why didn't you tell me about this? I don't know. Because I wasn't sure. Because I didn't know if it was real or not. Well, it was real enough for you to go to the police. Because of what happened today, Aiden. Okay, okay. I have an idea. We get married. - Come on, Aiden. - What? That's your brilliant idea for how to stop a stalker? - To get married? - I already wanted to already. You know that. But think about it. It makes sense. How does it make sense? We get married. I go on your health insurance. Then I can work freelance. Again, I don't see how that helps the situation. Then I can be with you all the time. Work on your schedule. Protect you. I'm not gonna marry you out of fear. Is this why you didn't wanna tell me? Why I didn't tell you what? 'Cause you knew that I'd ask you to marry me? My God. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not being ridiculous. I'm being insightful. Do not try to psychoanalyze me, Aiden, okay? You're not that smart. Aiden. Gosh. Come on. I didn't mean it like that. Babe, I'm sorry. Really. Okay? I'm just really, really tired. What do you want from me? You just hold me. Have to admit it's kind of nice to get out of the studio. It just feels a little claustrophobic in there sometimes. You happy at Polaris? I mean, this whole caller thing notwithstanding. Wow. Talk about a conversation stopper. Sorry. It's just... oh, forget it. No. No. I'm sorry. Go ahead. What's up? It's just... I feel like they're taking advantage of you. Taking advantage of me how? I mean, you have the highest rated show in that time slot. Okay. So you think I should what, negotiate more money? Or maybe there are some other places that would value you more. Like where? Maybe Clear Cell. - Gage? - Huh? Robert Gage, the CEO of Clear Cell. - You spoke to him? - What? No. No. That's just... Man. Don't worry. He approached me too. I told him I didn't wanna talk to you about it but he can be very persuasive. I understand, Keith. Just forget about it. You ever thought about it though? I mean like really. - What? - Leaving. I mean, I'm sure Clear Cell will roll out the red carpet for you. I mean, they're much bigger than Polaris and their stock has been consistently rising. Not to mention, they'd probably put together a pretty nice package for you. Just for me? Well, me and Lily could be a part of that package. Keith, I don't wanna talk about this anymore. I just... I have enough on my mind already. - Yeah. It's... - Please don't try to work Lily on this, okay? - Okay. - I just don't need her worrying that I might jump ship. What's going on with this caller of yours? I went to the police. The police? Seriously? Yeah. He left a note on my car. - Threatening you? - No. It was a love note. Even worse. What did the cop say? What do you think they said? There's no tangible threat so there's nothing they can do. And you have no idea who it could be? That's the thing. It could be anybody. Except for me and Lily. We're in the station with you when the calls come in. Uh, you two weren't at the top of my list anyways, so... Right after I graduated... Oh, you mean like yesterday? Very funny. Right after I graduated, I interned at the station in Chicago. Terrestrial. Old-school. One of the host, a young woman had a similar experience, all right? This guy kept calling in and, eventually, he showed up, waiting for her to come out. And you know what happened when she came out? He screamed. He literally screamed and ran away. Hey, my point is these guys are cowards. They just latch on to you because they can hear your voice. And when they see you in the real world, they just hightail it out of there, all right? They're not dangerous. They're just incredibly sad and incredibly lonely. I really hope you're right. I am. I promise. Coffee's on me. Let's go. What's up, Lily? Uh, preventing an ambush. - Stan, he wants to see us. - Oh. - Just what I needed. - Mm-hmm. Is it about the timeslot? - I'd imagine. - Mm-hmm. I don't know. I just figured - I'd give you a heads-up. - Yeah. You've had enough surprises lately. Thank you. So any new developments this morning? With John Doe, no. But with Aiden, he's using the situation to try and convince me to marry him. - Oh, boy. - Yeah. Tell me about it. But how is that gonna help? Oh, he said he can protect me. Yeah. Look, Michelle, you know, if you really wanna marry him, there's nobody else who's gonna be happier for you than me, okay? - Mm-hmm. - But make sure you're doing it for the right reasons and not because of fear. Oh, yeah, I know. Of course. Let's just get this meeting over with. Thanks for your time, ladies. I know you have a show to prep. Oh, did we have a choice? I just wanted to see if you've given any more thought to the change in timeslots? Well, we told you, we like where we are. You like where you are? It's just the management. They're liking mornings more and more. - Which means? - Which means I can't promise anything officially, but if you agree to this move, it might come with a pay raise. Oh, sweetening the pot, huh, Stan? Taking care of you like I always do. You know that. Oh, you're all heart, Stan. Come on, Lily. This could be a good thing for all of us. So is it still our choice or are we at the point where somebody else is making those decisions? It is still your choice, for now. But I can't promise it always will be, and that's the truth. Thank you, Stan. We'll think about it. Now, if you don't mind, we have a show to prepare. All I'm asking is for you to think about it. Be smart. What's with giving him the bum's rush? Do you think it could be Stan? The caller? I mean, we both caught him leering at us before. You said so yourself. I mean, sure, he has that dirty old man vibe but I'd expect him to start hitting on you before he started harassing you. Well, that's true, but what if he's doing this to frighten us into taking the morning timeslot, making us think that nights are too dangerous? I wouldn't put it past him necessarily but they could really force us to move if they really wanted to. I know, but it's like he said, they wanna keep us happy. This way they have their cake and eat it too. Hmm. Do you know if Stan was in the studio when any of the calls came in? I don't know, but he could have easily stepped out to make them. Nah. But I would have recognized his voice. No, that's the thing. Whoever is doing this is disguising their voice. They're using a computer program or something. That's what I didn't realize at first. That's why it disturbed me so much. It's... it's unnatural sound. Nah, I still don't think it's Stan. Hmm, but I guess it could be. I don't know. What do you wanna do? I don't know. Let's just focus on the show for now. It's the only thing keeping me sane. Michelle. Not now, Robert, okay? Look, can't a guy say a friendly hello? As if that's all it ever is with you. Now that you mentioned it, I'd be happy to discuss my latest offer. Or have one of your underlings do it? Underlings? Oh. You mean, your coworker? Yeah. That was a dirty pull, even for you. No. On the contrary, that was upfront and generous. If one of the things that's holding you back is the welfare of your team, then I just want them to know that they'll be well taken care of. Behind my back? Just being aggressive. There's nothing unethical about that. Okay. If you say so. You know, Michelle, most hosts would consider themselves lucky to be in your situation. You're right, Robert. Thank you so much for harassing me. Just remember, the shelf life of a radio personality, even a good one, isn't as long as you think. I'll remember that. Call me if you change your mind. What did you just say? I said call me if you change your mind. Call you? Is there something that you wanna say to me, Robert? About what? Jeez. We just went through this. I know, but the timeline is very important. So if you wouldn't mind walking me through it again. I came home. I went straight to my bedroom. And you didn't look around the house before that? - No. - And your front door was locked? - Yes. Yes. I'm positive. - You're sure? And I locked it as soon as I got back inside. Deadbolt, just like I've been doing recently. But before you entered the bedroom, you didn't notice anything? No. Nothing out of the ordinary. Have you noticed anything missing from the home? I mean, I haven't really looked. You don't really have any valuables, something that somebody would want? I don't know. Maybe some jewelry. It's all still there though. - Wallet, credit cards? - I have those with me. Detective, it's obvious this wasn't a theft. Whoever is doing this is just trying to scare Michelle. Well, what about you, Mr. Sykes. - Excuse me? - Well, you said whoever it is is trying to frighten Michelle, but it's you whose face is scratched out. I just assumed, as I thought we all did, that whoever is doing this is obsessed with Michelle, and he wants me out of the picture, literally and figuratively. I think it's premature to assume anything right now. So, Ms. Hall, does anyone else have the key to your house? No. It's just me and Aiden. No one else? Not a friend - or a neighbor or a coworker? - No. And you still have your key? It wasn't stolen or anything? So after you noticed that the photographs had been defaced, then what did you do? I called Aiden. And where were you, Mr. Sykes? - I was at my office. - So early? I generally make my own hours. If I go in early, I can be home in time for when Michelle wakes up. Then we can spend some time together before her shift. Look, Detective, I know that you have to take all of this information down. How are you going to stop the person who's doing this? Frankly, Ms. Hall, I'm not sure we are. Oh, we'll try. We'll try. But a break-in with no signs of forced entry and which nothing was taken, look, I'd be lying if I told you this will be a priority for the department. Can't you dust for prints? Fingerprinting isn't like what you see on TV, Mr. Sykes. Even if we get usable prints, which is rare, we still need a sample to compare them to. Now, you know, I think the best thing for Ms. Hall to do is to be vigilant. Never go anywhere alone. Lock your doors. Keep your eyes open. So exactly what I've been doing? This guy is a coward. He's getting a cheap thrill. As soon as he sees it's not getting to you, he'll back off. I'm sure of it. You know, in some ways, I'd feel better if it was a theft. And nothing was missing from the home? Hmm, nothing she knows about. But that doesn't even really matter, because no professional thief is going to scratch out her boyfriend's face from her photographs. So maybe the threat was against the boyfriend? Yeah. That's what I told her, but she doesn't really believe that, and I don't either. You know, I hate to say it but this thing - is gonna escalate. - Yeah? Yeah. I mean, the calls and then stalking, breaking and entering. We both know where it's going. I can't keep a man on her 24/7. What about the boyfriend? Well, he's around a lot. That's good. He works. He's got his own place. But he's not professional security. Which means that there's still an opening for someone who's really motivated to come in and hurt her. Of course. Well, you could always dust for prints. I just don't get that feeling. What feeling is that? Well, that this was a pro with a sheet in the system. This has always felt personal. So if you can't find him, you know, you just gotta wait. - Until what? - Till he strikes again. I'm afraid that might be too late. Lily. Come on in. Have a seat. - You got a minute? - Of course. And you're early. The show doesn't start for a few hours. We go back a long ways, Stan. Indeed we do. What's up? Is there anything you wanna tell me? Anything I wanna tell you? I'm not sure what you mean. - Michelle's caller. - Michelle's caller? - Uh-hmm. - Lily, I'm serious. I have no idea what you're talking about. Wait a minute. You think it's me? No. It makes sense, Stan. You can't be serious. You want us to move to mornings, so... you don't wanna strong-arm us, so you make some calls to frighten Michelle and then maybe we move on our own and then you look like the hero. You really think I would do that? I mean, you've made some inappropriate suggestions before? That's not true. I'm not that kind of... Wait a minute. Lily, you mean when you first started working here and I invited you over for a drink? Well, you were my boss. I was your subordinate. - I mean, it was inappropriate. - You're ridiculous. It was a different time, Lily. My God. Yeah, well, still inappropriate. Do you really not see the difference between someone asking a hot-looking coworker like yourself for a drink and what that freak is doing to Michelle? Look, I can't believe I even have to justify myself, but if it makes you feel better, for the record, I have nothing to do with what's happening to Michelle. Hmm. That was I Can Feel Your Love All Night Long by the Locomotives. If I had a nickel for every school dance where I slow-danced to that song, but let's hear from our callers. I wanna hear what songs you slow-danced to when you were young and stupid. Hello, Curtis. Welcome to Heart of the Night. Tell me what songs did you find magic with in that school gym? Oh, man. There were so many. Heaven by Bryan Adams, Faithfully by Journey, Beth from Kiss. Oh, Curtis, you're bringing me back. And my favorite, My Boyfriend's Photo. I don't think I know that one. Sure you do, Michelle. It's the one where the woman comes home to find that someone's been in her house and destroyed all the pictures of her boyfriend. Who is this? I think you know, Michelle. I think you've always known. I'll do whatever you ask, Michelle. You know that. Look, Keith, don't take this the wrong way. We've just always been under the impression that you're involved in some unsavory activities. We heard you're a hacker. I got some skills. So you can help us. What do you need me to do? I need to find out who's calling me. The number is blocked. - Exactly. - So what can I do? Well, you can hack into the phone company's servers. Lily, come on. - You're serious? - Uh-hmm. Okay. Well, then I should tell you that the telecom companies have some of the best protected networks in the world. I mean, you're talking about multiple layers of firewalls and other fail-safes. Oh, okay, okay, okay. We don't need a class in Hacking 101, Keith. We just need to know if it's possible. Well, then the answer is no. I mean, this isn't hacking into a school or a local business. This is black ops stuff. Wait, and even if I could access the servers, there's no guarantee that I could find the correct phone number. And even if I found the correct phone number, there's no guarantee that like it's not a burner phone. Okay. I get it, Keith. You can't help us. Well, I didn't say that. Well, we're open to ideas. If this is just some random dude, then, yeah, you're SOL. But you two are smart and I'm guessing you kind of have an idea of who it could be. And if we do? I could access their emails, social media accounts, their bank statements, and even credit card receipts. Well, what good is that gonna do? It'll tell you if you're on the right track. It's Stan. I gotta hand it to you guys. When you ask for a favor, you really ask for a favor. So can you do it or not? Yeah. I'll do it. But you wanna tell me why you suspect Stan? I mean, he's the last person I'd think who'd wanna damage the show. For now, let's just say this is on us. All right. Hey. - Hey. - How did you sleep? Not terrible. You didn't go to work today? I'm working remotely today. I figured you could use me at home. I told you I refuse to be a prisoner in our own home. So what am I? A warden? Don't pick a fight with me, Aiden. Not right now. I'm not picking a fight with you. I'm trying to protect you and instead of thanks, all I'm getting is hostility. Okay. I just... I need some space. I'm gonna grab some coffee before work. - Where? - Why? Do you wanna follow me too? I'm just... I'm just making conversation. It's what normal couples do. Wait, what do you mean too? Nothing. Sorry. No, what? Just the other day when I was talking to Mr. Sklar, he mentioned that he saw me at the coffee shop. Okay. What's weird about that? He didn't say hi to me but he remembered exactly what I ordered. Do you want me to go over there? I know he's home. I saw him watering his flowers. No. No. What would you even say? I'd tell him to stop creeping out my girlfriend. No. No. I'll be fine. Okay. - Rapid Heart. - Huh? You asked where I was going. I'm going to Rapid Heart, where I always go. Okay. ♪ ...the one for me ♪ Show it off for the world to see ♪ ♪ Hold your body right next to me ♪ ♪ All I wanna see... ♪ Oh ♪ All I hear every day is the sound... ♪ Can I help you? This song... Yeah, it's a weird choice, huh? Who decides on the music? Oh, we have a corporate-approved playlist. It's... I think it's an old iPod in the back. - Can I see it? - The iPod? Yeah, I don't think that I could... that you'd like to... Okay. Can I speak to your manager? Okay. ♪ If I can't have you... - He'll be right down. - Yeah. ♪ If I can't have you playing my song ♪ - Okay. - Thank you. ♪ If I can't have you tell me... ♪ Can I help you, ma'am? Hi. Uh, yes. This song, why is it playing? ♪ If I can't have you Uh, I don't understand. Come on. Come on, Tim. Please don't play this game with me. Why did you play this song? Is there an issue? There will be if you don't tell me. Um... Oh. Okay. Now talk. A guy pulled up to the drive-through and wanted to see the manager. He asked me to do him a favor. He said he just got back from overseas and wanted to surprise his girlfriend who was in here. He asked if we could play their song. - So you did it? - I told him I couldn't. That it was against company policy. He told me that it would make her day, and then he slipped me a $20. I don't make that much money working here. It seemed harmless. What did he look like? Um, average, I guess. He was wearing a hat pulled down low. Honestly, I didn't get a good look at his face. - And the car? - Ordinary sedan. Kind of a nasty pea soup color. Did you get a look at the license plate? Why would I have gotten the license plate? Your drive-through has security cameras, right? Sure. We're required to. Any chance I can take a look at that footage? Not even for a $20? Sorry... but I made that mistake once today already. Hey. You owe me. Yes, I do. But I'm afraid you're not gonna like it. Our boss has the most boring correspondence I have ever seen. Inside that envelope is everything about you and Lily that he's discussed with management. And if you ask me, it's a whole bunch of nothing. What would you say to another favor? I'd say it's my turn to ask you for one. Fair. But I wanna give you a chance to show off those hacking skills of yours. I'm listening. Can you hack into the internet of a coffee shop? For what? They all have free Wi-Fi anyway. To access their security cameras. Now you're talking. I mean, if the cameras don't run on a closed circuit and it just run through the store's ISP, then yeah. What do you need? I feel like we should be wearing trench coats and fedoras. Were you able to do it or not? Well, for the time you gave me, there was only one green car that came through the drive-through. This is the license plate. Do you know who the car is registered to? That costs money. Unless I hack into the DMV which... well, it's a felony. Thank you. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna pay the 30 bucks to find out who it is. Then I'll have his name, his phone number, his address, everything on public record. And we'll have our man. Oh, my God. - Hmm. Yeah? - Are you asleep? I'll sleep when I'm dead. What's up? I got it. I got everything. Well, who is it? Just get over here. Now. I'll be right there. So who is it? His name won't mean anything to you. Okay. Uh... what are you doing? - It's him. - Who? My next-door neighbor. His name is Benjamin Sklar. Do you know him? I mean, a little. Not really. We always just thought he was weird, not dangerous. Well, he must have been watching you this entire time. Yeah. I know, it all makes sense now. You know, once he even mentioned seeing me get coffee no less. Well, speaking of which... - It's brewing. - Okay. So what else you find out about him? Not much. Just his phone number, which is not enough evidence considering he always called the radio station from a blocked number. Wait. What more proof do you need though? You know those phone calls from that car and he happens to be your next-door neighbor. There's coincidences and there's impossibilities, Michelle. No, I know. I know. It's obviously him. It's just the phone number isn't enough proof. How long has she been here? Well, hello to you too, Aiden. She just got here. It's Mr. Sklar? It's freaking Mr. Sklar. I'm gonna go over there and beat the hell out of him. That's exactly what you can't do. Okay. If you don't want me to kill him then call the cops. - We can't. - Why? Aiden, I told you that we got the caller's information. I just didn't tell you how. Keith got it for us illegally. So what? You don't owe that little dork anything. Yes, we do. He put his neck out on the line for us. Plus, that's not even the main reason. Look, if we go to the police, they're gonna ask us how we got it, just to find out if it's genuine. And if they find out the truth, Benjamin Sklar could get off. Yeah. If he's arrested on evidence that was acquired illegally, even the least competent public defender - will be able to get him off. - Uh-hmm. So what are you gonna do? You two have been planning something. Well, right now there's still the element of surprise, so Benjamin Sklar has no idea we're on to him. Yeah. We wanna keep it that way. And what if he finds out? There's no way he could. Michelle, the longer he is out there, the more trouble you're in. I don't think he wants to hurt me. I just... I think in his sick mind, he thinks he's in love with me. You don't know that. I don't care how much insight you think you have from the show. - You could be in danger. - Okay. - Well, what is your idea, Aiden? - I threaten him. I tell him we know who he is and what he's been doing. And what good is that gonna do? It will scare him and then he'll leave Michelle alone. Well, we don't want him scared. - We want him caught. - Yeah. Then call the cops and take your chances. Spell that again please. Okay. Now, he's never threatened you or anything? Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll look into it, Ms. Hall. But unless you tell me why you suspect this neighbor of yours, there's just so much I can do. Okay. Uh-hmm. Oh, okay. I'll be in touch. Goodbye. Michelle Hall? She's convinced it's her neighbor, Benjamin Sklar. - That name mean anything to you? - Uh-uh. Why would it? Well, you know, I was hoping he might have a record - and you'd recognize it. - Uh-uh. - Why is she so sure it's him? - Wouldn't say it. She just kept saying how creepy he was. Well, creepy isn't a crime. You know, I know there's something she's not telling me, - but... - What? It wouldn't hurt to have a conversation with him, then I could see what kind of vibe I get from him. Well, he could refuse to talk to you, you know? He could, but then we'd know he's got something to hide. Or he knows his rights. Innocent men talk, Lisa. You know that. Only thing more certain is that the husband did it. Well, unfortunately, for you, in this case, there is no husband. No, there isn't. I think that's a great idea. - You do? - Of course. You think I want an on-air host who fears for her safety? - Nada. - Hmm. - Thank you, Stan. - No pressure. But how long do you think you'll be gone? Just a few days, until we get this all sorted. Of course. The... well, the company will give you any support you need. We're in touch with the authorities. - With the authorities? - Uh-hmm. Well, I guess that's best. Who do you think you'll get to fill in? Oh, I don't know. A few days, I might just run some of your old shows. Or maybe... maybe give Wade a chance. - Hmm. - He's been on me for weeks about giving him more than just a few segments of Bedside Bill and the Mailman. Oh, Wade is a ratings killer. I know. I hate the show. But, like I said, it's only a few days. I'm sorry but, Michelle, I gotta ask you a question. This isn't a ploy or anything just because I suggested a new timeslot, is it? Because the decision is yours. If you say so, I will back off. How dare you, Stan? If this is about the request, you'd know. And for the record, no, we're not changing time slots. Okay. Okay. I just had to ask. Look, it's probably not appropriate to say enjoy your time off, but... I hope you take care of whatever need to get done. Get out of my office, girls. You still think it could be him? No. I never really did. He's not really smart enough to pull something like this off anyways. Uh-uh. And he doesn't have the energy. True. - Wanna get something to eat? - Why not? Who knows how long this stakeout is gonna last. What if he works the night shift like we do? No. That's highly unlikely. It says online he's a marketing executive. Plus, he makes all those calls to the radio station at night. He wouldn't be able to do that from work. What if he doesn't come straight home, like if he goes to a girlfriend's or something? You think this psycho has a girlfriend? - Hmm. - No way. That's why he's calling me. What if he goes to like a restaurant - or like a bar or... - Oh, my God. Would you stop it, Lily? - What? - We decided. We're gonna wait until we see him. And then what? And then we see where he goes and what he does. And then what? Then we let him know that we're watching. So where do you think he is? Who knows? Maybe he's working late. Well, we have his cellphone number, you know? No, not yet. Plus, even if we call, that won't tell us where he is. Well, if we're gonna be here all day, why don't we go in shifts? You wanna take the first watch? No. You got it. I wanna catch some Zs right now. Let me know if anything changes. Yeah. What are you doing here? Michelle! - Look. - What? Oh, my God. I don't believe this. I thought he had plans. That's what he told me. Hey! - Michelle. - Get inside. I... - What the hell are you doing? - What do you think I was doing? - Even after I asked you not to? - Well, what do you expect? My girlfriend is being harassed by some freak. We find out it's the next-door neighbor and I can't do anything about it? How do you think that makes me feel? I don't really care how it makes you feel, Aiden. This is about me. Fine. What were you even gonna do? Beat him up? Maybe? I didn't think that far ahead. And what were you doing? Why are you two watching Sklar's house? We're keeping an eye on him. And you told me not to confront him? We weren't going to confront him, okay? We're just watching him. We're seeing when he gets home, when he leaves, what he does. - What did you find out? - Nothing. He never came home. All right. I'm gonna take a shower. Clear my head. I'm sorry. It'll be okay. Well, he's devoted. I'll give him that. You think we should try Sklar's office? Uh-hmm. Yeah, 'cause if he's there, at least we know he's not home. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good morning. Marketing. Hi. I'm trying to reach Benjamin Sklar. Mr. Sklar is not in right now. - Can I take a message? - Oh, really? I had a call scheduled with him. Do you know when he'll return? Uh, Mr. Sklar hasn't been in this entire week and frankly we're not really sure where he is. Thank you very much. So if he's not at home, he's not at work, where is he? He could be at home. You mean, in there cooped up the entire time? How do we find out? Michelle Hall, soft rock DJ by day, cat burglar by night. Actually, in your case, it's DJ by night, cat burglar by day. I'm glad we could amuse you, Keith. Now, can you help us or not? I'm not really sure how I feel about you coming to me every time something illegal needs to be done. Hmm. So do you want me to tell Accounting to take a closer look at your expense reports, hmm? - Your wish is my command. - Hmm. - So you can do it? - Depends on the lock. How would I know what kind of lock he has? Get a picture of it? Or you said he was your neighbor, right? - Yeah. - Do you know if all the houses in your neighborhood were built around the same time? - I don't know. - Okay. Well, let's assume so. Do you have your key? - What are you doing? - All keys are stamped with a code to identify the type of lock. Yeah, I can pick it. Thank you, Keith. As soon as I hear that click, I'm out of there. Got it? I don't know what you two have planned. I definitely don't wanna be there when the cops come, okay? This might be a surprise to you two but I might have had a little legal trouble in the past. We get it. Once you open the door, you're a ghost. When? Maybe we should knock? For what reason? To make sure nobody's home. We know that nobody's home. This house is still dark. Okay. You guys can argue all you want later. Are we doing this or not? - Yeah. - All right. Remember, as soon as I hear the click, I'm out of here, all right? - Good luck. - Thanks, Keith. Oh, God. Michelle, I don't like this. - It's okay. We're fine. - No, no, no. I really don't like this. Lily, we have to be quiet. Bedroom. Are these really necessary? Thank you. Are you sure you don't want a lawyer? No. I don't want a lawyer. I told you, okay? I called you. - Ms. Hall, now we could... - Please... can you call me Michelle? Michelle, you broke into the home of a man who was murdered. Now, I know you called the police, but certainly you can see how this looks. - Where's Lily? - In another room with a colleague of mine. Are you trying to trip us up? Just making sure your stories match. That's all. I explained everything to you on the ride over here. Can I be frank, Ms. Hall? I don't think you killed Mr. Sklar. For one thing, you're not a killer and if you were, why would you call us? What's more, you freely admitted to breaking into the home. But what I can't figure out, for the life of me, is why you thought it was Mr. Sklar who was harassing you. If you tell me, it could exonerate you. But, more importantly, it could help us find who actually killed Mr. Sklar. I told you I can't. And why is that? I think it's because you're protecting someone. Is it Lily? Oh. Excuse me a minute. The coroner did a preliminary report. It seems Mr. Sklar has been dead for about a week. Now, we'll get an exact time after the autopsy. Okay. But if that's true, then he couldn't have been the man who's been stalking me. No, he couldn't. Michelle, please, please, is there anything you wanna tell me? We're missing something. I just don't know what it is. We need to go back and look at the possible suspects again. Yeah, but who? Stan? I mean, that never felt right. It's obviously not Keith. It's somebody else. It's somebody I don't know. Well, he must know you. I don't know. I don't know. I just... I really need to get some sleep. Yeah. I know. I know. Me too. Is Aiden home? I can't even reach him. He's probably so pissed at me, which, honestly, I can't even blame him. Look, why don't we both get some sleep and then we'll get a bite to eat later. We'll go over everything again, okay? Stay safe. Yeah. So what do you think? I think they're hiding something. Well, of course they're hiding something, but... What? Well, they are not killers. At least, Michelle isn't. But what about her friend? Not a chance. Well, she admitted that she suspected Sklar and she also confessed that she couldn't tell us why she suspected Sklar. I figure she's protecting someone. - Lily? - No. I don't think so. I'm afraid it's the person who killed Sklar. She might not even realize it. Well, if that's true, that's aiding and abetting. I know. What if Sklar really was stalking her and she caught him and killed him? That's not even premeditation. That's self-defense. Well, why couldn't she tell us that? - She's afraid. - I don't know. Remember now, she was still being stalked, even after the victim was already dead. So she says. You think she's making it all up? I think there's a lot more going on here than we realize. And unless we figure it out soon, there's gonna be another person dead. No, no, no. Michelle. Robert, I'm not in the mood right now. Not in the mood for what? For your offers or your threats or your innuendos. Michelle. Just heading to my car. Robert. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Are you okay? I honestly don't know. Well, I wouldn't tell anybody that. If you need my help, you let me know, okay? Hello? Aiden? Hello, Michelle. Hello, Michelle. You? Never even crossed your mind, did it? I don't know if I should be flattered or insulted. I don't understand. Yes, you do. You just don't wanna admit it to yourself. Play If I Can't Have You, Michelle. Play it for me. You're crazy. Crazy for you. Can't you see that? I mean, do you have any idea what it was like for me? What was like for you, Aiden? I have no idea what you're talking about. I would listen to all your shows. Listen to you give all those poor people advice. You're so kind, so sympathetic. And then you would come home to me and I would get a different Michelle. Aiden, you and me, that's real life. My show, it's... I'm just playing a character. No. You can't fake that kind of emotion, that kind of heart. You gave all of yourself to strangers. Why couldn't you save some of that for me? Look, I know we had our problems, okay, but Aiden, I loved... I love you. That's not true. I gave you plenty of chances to show it. You don't love me. I'm not sure that you ever really did. What does Benjamin Sklar have to do with any of this? Why did you have to kill him? Benjamin Sklar was just collateral damage. I needed somewhere close by to watch you when we weren't together. Plus, I needed someone to pin it on. The car, for example, it led back to him. I didn't actually think that you were gonna break into his house. So when I saw you, you really were going to his house? The best lie is always wrapped in some truth. I was going over to remove Sklar's body so no one would find him. You thought I was going over there to avenge you. Oh, my God. Aiden, did you really think you could frighten me into your arms, into marriage? Well, I don't have to worry about that anymore. Neither of us do. That is sweet. The police are on their way. Oh, my God. How did you know where to come? Keith. What do you mean? What does... What does Keith have to do with this? I went into the office to pick up some stuff and Keith was there. I filled him in about everything. Okay. He mentioned how he saw Aiden driving Benjamin Sklar's car, you know, through the drive-through. And I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He said he assumed that we both knew it was Aiden in the car. I mean, I guess they caught Aiden's reflection in the side-view mirror. His face was so perfectly clear. And when I heard that, I mean, I just knew. - I just knew. - Uh-hmm. I called the police and I came right over. Tell me, did that work, Ian? It did. This Friday will be our six-month anniversary. We are happier than ever. That warms my heart, Ian. And it warms this Heart of the Morning. Before we take a break, Michael has been trying to call in for a while now. He's requested If I Can't Have You. Thanks for hanging in there, Michael. No, thank you, Michelle.
