CAMILLE: Hi. JANAY: Is she always like that? CAMILLE: I don't know, I mean... I've only been living with her for like five years, so... Why? CAMILLE: She's whatever. Like... hard to be around sometimes. So, when the courts asked who I wanted to live with, I chose him. JANAY: Damn. Yeah, once a year, I was supposed to see her during Christmas to, you know, exchange me. But... every time we would go, I would just sit in the car and I'd see her through the glass, sitting, waiting for me. But I just couldn't get out. I'd... I would just sit there and... my dad would have to go in and be like, "Oh, Camille doesn't want to see you." And so, we'd just leave. JANAY: That's a lot. CAMILLE: Yeah, once I turned 11, I started, like... changing, physically. I used to stand in front of the mirror and punch myself in the chest because I didn't... I didn't want to grow breasts. It was horrifying 'cause... I was always, you know, dressing in boys' clothes and... playing football, and hanging out with my dad. And when I noticed that I wasn't going to be like that forever and that I was growing up, it was super embarrassing because he didn't... he didn't notice, he didn't understand. Uh... So, one year, that year, I... on Christmas, I decided, like, I needed to see her. I needed to go. It's not even like I wanted to. I needed a mother. But I went and... I just started spending more time with her. Eventually, after a couple of weeks, I felt like maybe I should stay with her, start living there and... Uh, my dad was just super jealous. He didn't think that... I'd ever... leave him. And I wasn't trying to leave him but... I didn't wanna leave him, I just... He just wasn't... Now we don't talk anymore and... and I feel so bad because I didn't want him to feel like I didn't want him anymore. It's just I... needed a mom at that time, and, like... JANAY: I totally understand. Like I... I totally understand what you're going through and it sucks and I don't want you to beat yourself up about it. Yo, come on. We have to get to LES before all the assholes get there. Skate or die, bitch. KURT: What the fuck? Yo, we out to the back. KURT: Yo, back the fuck off, son!

It's, like, is it a thing where you pop first and then flick, or is it one motion? CAMILLE: Yeah, you have to pop. I don't know, it depends. I think about it... I think about it I was like, as I pop, I'm flicking and turning. I think of it as doing a 180 and then like, just adding the flick in there, you know? JANAY: See, but you do that whole thing - where like... - CAMILLE: I just pivot. Yeah, you do, like... I feel like you make it a two-part thing. KURT: Yeah.

And us girls, we think too much. - JANAY: I cannot do that. - Yes, you can. Like, I could but I like my life. Once boys hit puberty, they just get really good. I don't know. You notice that? JANAY: Eh, no. I don't pay that much attention to this shit. CAMILLE: Wow, is that in Midtown? JANAY: Yeah. I wanna go there. JANAY: That's, like by Bryant Park. (MAN IN VIDEO) You rolling, bro? You guys haven't taken me there. We should go. I think that might be a little much. CAMILLE: What do you mean? JANAY: I mean, I just don't think all of the girls would wanna do that. CAMILLE: But you wanna stand out, right? Yeah, I want us all to stand out, like I wanna... CAMILLE: So then we should just go hard. It'll be fun. I've seen you do things way bigger at skate parks.

(PHONE RINGING) JANAY: Who is that? Oh, my God. Don't even worry about your mom right now. She's... You're gonna be valid in a couple of weeks and we'll be skating and you'll think back to this day and it'll just be a thing that happened. JANAY: I guess. What's wrong? Sprains take a couple of weeks. Really and before you know it, we'll be skating and going to LES and back it. It's gonna go by fast. Just stay up. Come on! Come on. You sure? It'll make you feel better. I got this from Kurt. Don't tell her I took it. Come on. Let's watch some TV or something. KURT: Put your foot, like... put it like closer to here.

Who do you like? - What's his name? - I don't like anyone. - You like someone. - CAMILLE: No, I... no I don't. I'm being really serious. Even though I'm smiling I swear. Whatever. But Janay and that dude what's up with them? Like, the dude at the party. Are they togeth... Are they, like a thing? They were, like all over each other. Nah, he didn't mean anything to her.

He's an asshole. I wish she would. But it's whatever. KURT: Your fucking foot looks like my tie-dye, bro. That's crazy. - I know. - CAMILLE: That's a sign that it's healing though. - It's the same color as her board, yo. - JANAY: Yeah, really? Are you icing it?
