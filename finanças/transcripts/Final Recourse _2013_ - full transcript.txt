[imitating spaceship] Zoom, zoom! Mom, the whipped cream. Ooh! The whipped cream. You got it. - And more Gummi Worms! - Gummi Worms! You got it! Here you go. One for me and one for you. Hey, you're supposed to be putting these on the pancakes and then eating them. But you're eating them! Whose side are you on? Mom, you're still taking me to the game, right? You betcha. Soon as Dad gets out of bed, we're gonna go practice, all right? Mmm! - Me too! - Me too, me too! You try it. Mother of the Year award. Rebel yell! Geronimo! [laughing] A little whipped cream, perhaps? A little mustache? Oh, there we go! Yay! Breakfast of champions! All right, here we go. Go, go, go, go, go! All right, you take it in, buddy! Take it in, take it in! I got you! Almost! Go, hit it. Go, kick it. Go. - Go. - Whoa! - We're awful soccer players. - Yeah, we are. Sorry to interrupt! I just got the redline for the Jonco deal. - Okay. - Whatever happened to scanning? Well, my orders were clear: contract arrives, foot hits the gas pedal. It's Saturday, soldier. Orders must be obeyed. By the way, do soldiers get overtime? Half these changes are laughable. What do you want me to do? Tell them if they stall any longer, we're going to China. Come on, Brooke. You gotta get going. Yeah, I know. Just let me go over this real quick. Billy's gotta be there early to warm up. [sighs] Uh... I can finish this, Brooke. No, I know. Can you possibly get him there, and then I promise I'll be there before the game starts, sweetheart, all right? Scout's honor. Look at me. Okay, um... definitely strike the indemnification clause 'cause that is not our problem. You can do this, right? - Any problems, you call me. - Okay. Hey, what are you standing there for? Let's go, let's go! We got a game to get to! Go on! We can change in the car! All right. Call me. Please call me. Thank you. Who you guys playin' today? The Manatees. They won two-to-one in their last game with an awesome free kick. Really? You're not scared of them, are you? - No. - No? You know what a manatee is, don't you? Nope. You have no idea what a manatee is? It's a sea cow! Moo! - [laughing] - Moo! You're not gonna let a bunch of big ol' honkin' sea cows beat you, are you? No way. I'm sorry, I did not hear that. - No way! - No, I still can't hear you! No way! No, with me. Are you ready? 1, 2, 3! [both] No way! [phone beeps] I bet you... a million dollars that you are better at soccer than I am at cross-training. That's not a sport. I can't believe that you would-- [grunts] Hey. Where's Billy? Where is Billy? Billy! My Billy! [crying continues] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me for all the days... [ice dropped in glass] Heading to bed. You coming? Uh, in a minute. - Brooke, we need to talk. - I'm not really tired. Breathe in. [inhales] - And out. - [exhales] I'm gonna give you a new prescription. Let me know how it works out. What no speech for added effect? Would anything I say make a difference? You're still in reasonable shape, despite what you're doing to your body. And I don't just mean the three packs a day and whatever it is you drink. Please. I'm not eating, either. I mean everything, Brooke. This has to change. People don't change, Keith. They just-- They just die. You need help. I need a new prescription. Thank you. Come on, Mommy. Mommy, wake up. [clears throat] Go to bed, sweetheart. What do you want? I'm hungry. Where's your daddy, honey? Asleep. Come on, Mom. [grunts] Okay, okay, okay, okay. So we need an egg, right? We need some eggs in there. Oh, shoot. Do you think that's too much? I think that's okay. What do you think? You think-- [laughing] It's fine! I think we can get a pancake out of that, don't you think so? All right. We'll make a really big pancake for you. Look at that! That is, like, the size of the Grand Canyon, that one. Chocolate chips. You want chocolate chips, right? - Lots! - Lots of chocolate chips? All right, we're gonna put lots of chocolate chips in there. And, uh, I don't know, I think we should flip it. What do you think? Okay, um... back up a lit so we can-- so we can flip it up really high, okay? Okay, you ready? Put that under there, and we will-- We'll do it on three with Mommy, right? Ready? One, two, three! Oh, what a mess. Will you help Mommy clean that-- Oww! Mommy! - Oww! - Emma! Emma! Emma, Emma, Emma! Brooke, Brooke! - No, she's okay. - Yes, let her go. Let her go. Let her go. Emma, here. It's okay, it's okay. You need to talk to someone. But I'm doing so very well. - We can go together. - If you want to go together. I have spoken to ten people in the last nine months, and I-- I have no desire. What did you talk about, the weather? I don't want to talk to any more strangers about my feelings, okay? And listen to their psychological crap, mumbo-jumbo that does nothing for me. These are my feelings, and I'd like to leave it that way because I am fine. - No, you're not! - I'm fine! You're not fine! You hurt our daughter. If you don't see someone, and you don't stop, I don't want you around her. You're lucky that it's your birthday because I could get really, really very upset with you for saying that, but I will not ruin your birthday party. I didn't want a party. I'll be on my best behavior. But we're, uh, we're the Holtons and we have parties, honey, so... I'll be right here, Ms. Holton. Park the car in the garage. Welcome back, Ms. Holton. It's the best I could do under the circumstances. - Hmm. - We're doing the right thing. Mm-hmm. [phone rings] Mrs. Holton just arrived. Thank you, Helen. I thought you said she was gonna be back next week. She's got a mind of her own. I'll see you tonight. Okay. Go out the front. She uses the side door. Okay. I'm sick of all this waitin' around. When are we gonna do this? Easy does it. Haven't gotten the green light yet. Hey, Brooke! Perfect timing, as always. How are you? You know, with the Jonco deal, we still have those key issues to discuss. They won't go for a 5% fee, the escrow terms, and our labor contracts. Hey, um, Helen, can you please get me the contracts? Right away, right away. Figure we can make up the 5% in storage and materials, but if you want to pull this off, you've got to come up with more cash in escrow. We've got to give them something. Okay, well, I suppose we can take the, um, the money out of the First Security Trust account, but that's mine, so when it closes, I'm gonna need it back. These are the board minutes, Helen. I'm sorry, Mrs. Holton. I just thought you might need those first. Well, don't think. Do as you are asked. If you cannot do that, we will find someone that can. Hey, Brooke, why don't you come with me. All right. - What? - Sorry. Uhh... This isn't you talking. I know. I had a cousin with the same kind of problem. The only problem I have is an incompetent assistant problem. You can do this from home. Why don't you just go home and rest? My son lived at home with his soccer shirts and his little spaceship toys. That was home. Please don't talk to me about home. ♪♪ [piano] Brooke, is that an original Zinardi? Uh, yeah. I spotted him when he was only worth a penny and a handshake. Art's more fickle than gas prices, don't you think? Mm-hmm. Everybody! Everybody listen up! It's, um, time for a little toast to my wonderful husband. Um, my beautiful Albert. Um... To your Spanish-American War novel extravaganza, may it be, um, published. And soon, right? And, um, a toast to all of his friends here that are celebrating this with us. That-- That's just great. Um... I've been practicing this all day, so I hope it goes well. Um... mi amore. [speaking Spanish] I think that's right. Nothing bad can last for more than a hundred years. Whoo!

Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Wake up! Brooke! How many did you take? Brooke. Shh. Why can't Mommy come with us? 'Cause Mommy's sick. Is she contagious? Just a little bit. What'd you say? We're gonna go to my mom's house for a couple days. I can't do this anymore, Brooke. I need a break. What are you talking about? What I said. I need some time. Okay, I will. Have fun. [scoffs] Go give Mommy a kiss. We gotta go. Get better soon. [knocking] Will you be needing anything else, Mrs. Holton? No! Shh! Shh. All the rats are leaving the sinking ship. Who are you? Get out of my house. [muffled screams] Shut up! Shut up! - [muffled screaming] - Shut up! Please take whatever you want. Whatever you want. Anything. Sign here. [gasping] "I'm Brooke Holton. I cannot go on living anymore for the purpose or desire--" What is this? What do you want? I want you to sign. What is-- This is ridiculous. I'm not signing this. I thought it sounded pretty good. Thanks. Sign it. Please, just take whatever you want. Come here. You can't just-- Ow! Keys! Car keys! There. Come on. Just take whatever you want. - Let's go! - Ow! Stop! You're loaded, lady. Loaded! Time to share. - [screams] - Shut up! [cries out] Shut up! Shut up! [muffled] No! Shut your mouth! Ohh! Shut up! - I won't say anything! - Shut your mouth! I'm not gonna say a word! Please! [engine starts] Help! Help me! Help me! [brakes squeal] Oh! So you pulled the tape off, huh? You're smart. You gonna be a good girl? All right, no more noise out of you, you understand? You hear me? All right, then. We could be twins, don't you think? Put your head down! MAN: Oh, my God! I think she just jumped off the bridge! WOMAN: Has anybody called 911 yet? - Did you see it? - Call 911! I think she's dead. How you doin' in there? [muffled] What? Okay. - You'll be good? - [mumbles] Thirsty? Mm-hmm. Yes. Help her. Gotta go? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Have her piss over there. I don't want her messing up my car. Come on. I'm gonna need some help with these when-- when I go to the bathroom. Ohh! You all right there? Come on! [panting] Aah! This is all your fault. We don't get our cut if we deliver a dead body. Pick her up already. Please, somebody, please. Please, somebody help me! Please! Somebody please help me! [retching] Hey, hey, hey! What's all the commotion? What's going on in here? Please. I need a drink. I need a drink. - I need-- - Some water right there. [incoherent muttering] Not your kind of drink, huh? [door slams] MAN: They paid you. I know they did! Stop, please! They paid you! [door slams] Good morning, Ms. Holton. Did you sleep well? My head is killing me. My associates tell me that you refuse to stay hydrated. What? Um... Uh... my name's Jerry. Like Jerry Lewis. Really funny guy. They don't make 'em like that anymore. What-- What-- Where am I? What is this place? Well... come with me and I'll show you. Let's go. Take a look. It's a tear-down. Somebody tried to make it a gym. Obviously it didn't work out. They put it in the middle of nowhere. This is gonna be your home for a while. But let me warn you, the doors are locked, the windows are barred, there's cameras all over the place. You see, uh... we'll be watching you. - How long have I been here? - Two days. I don't think you understand. I'm very sick. I need medical attention, please. Well, we're gonna get you a nice bowl of chicken soup and a little cup of hot tea. Rona. Put these on. [gunshot] [gunshot] Go. Look pretty good for a dead girl. I'd rather be dead than spend another night in this hellhole sober. Well, I got news for you. You are dead. A woman jumped off a bridge. Witnesses described the blonde your car, your suicide note. And that river goes straight to the ocean. How much do you want? Ten million. [chuckles] - Ten million? - Yeah. I think that's a reasonable sum for someone of your stature. Well, um, we don't-- we don't have that kind of money. That's not gonna happen. Oh, yes, it will. You see, when the case is officially closed, then everything calms down, and we break the news to your husband about your miracle resurrection, he'll pay. I just tied up a bunch of money for my company, and he has no idea how to get it out of escrow, so... Really? Well, that's not my problem, you see, because he's gonna have to find out. Then you're just gonna let me walk out of here? Yeah. I mean, after we get our money, I don't give a damn where you go. I'm gonna be sitting on an island, sipping a piña colada. I saw what happened to that guy that I heard you guys dragging kicking and screaming out of here - the first night I was here. - Oh, him? Yeah, well, you see, that's really none of your business. You're gonna cooperate with us. I know you are. You don't want anything to happen to them, do you? - Do you? - No. Right. Rona! Take her back to the cell. I can walk by myself. Thank you. Get in there. [distant banging] [louder banging] [banging] [banging continues] Hello? Go away! I don't want them to see me talking to you. Who are you? What's your name? Will. Will Graves. I'm Brooke. What are you doing here? You know, just kind of hanging out and enjoying some peace and quiet. Do you have any idea where we are? No. I don't know. I don't know anything. I told them already that my dad is gonna pay them whatever they want, so please, please, please leave me alone. Go! Go away! Can't sleep? No, not really. I don't blame you. Beautiful night. Well... if there's anything you'd like, just ask. We aim to please. How 'bout a different kind of sandwich? That'd be great. Or a cigarette, drink. I think smoking is a filthy habit. I mean, how could anybody smoke today with all the evidence out there? Amazes me. That's pretty funny, coming from you. Have you spoken with my husband yet? Why are you in such a rush to get back to drink your life away? You don't know the first thing about my life. You think you're here by accident? You think we stumbled on you by mistake? I know everything about you. Have you spoken to my husband or not? Albert Fuentes. You didn't take his name. No, I didn't. Why? Maybe we should, uh, send him your wedding ring. With the finger in it? Nah, that's a cliché, Carl. What do you think? Oh, I think it's scary. [chuckles] Yeah, I mean, that's what it's supposed to do, scare me, you know. Are you gonna send it in the mail all bloody and-- Don't push me Ms. Holton. 'Cause Carl will snap it off right now. Don't test me. Let's go. What are you doing? Oh. I, uh... [chuckles] Just trying to keep track of time. I don't even want to know anymore. Didn't you say your dad's sending the money, right? Yeah. He's in real estate, so... Um, your husband's rich? Uh, well, we are. I run Holton Industries. Sounds pretty massive. Yeah, pretty massive. What's it do? We manufacture cryogenic and heat transfer systems. Basically condense gas into liquid so you can transport it all over the world. I'm sure that makes you all sorts of confident, but... I'd rather you didn't give them any ideas about chopping off body parts. I want to keep all mine. For now, I'd like to just... comply and get home. You got a nice house, right? Husband? Two-and-a-half children? No. One. I have a daughter. I'm an only child, too. Uh... you said your name was Will? Yeah. Will Graves. Like, as in William? William, yeah. It's a nice name. Um, I'm sorry, Will. I will try and comply, not make any more waves. Thank you. So what do you do around here all day? Just this? Yeah. Sometimes I do it on-- on that side. There's nothing else to do here except to wait. Get up, get cleaned up, and put these on. Good morning, Ms. Holton. Where are you taking me? What's happening? We got a nice limo for you. Just relax. Everything's gonna be fine. I got you, I got you. Don't worry. Come on. Inside. Very good. Very good. You can take off the blindfold, Ms. Holton. You feel better? Yeah. Take off your rings. Just take off your rings. All of them. Rona, you know what to do with this. Let's see what you look like as a brunette. Here you go. The timing's right. Do it right. Looks good. Well, the service is gonna start in a few minutes. Should be interesting. Aren't you curious to see what they have to say about you? No, no, not really. Hey-- [muffled cries] She's very upset. Sorry. Don't try that again, do you hear me? - You gonna be good? - Mm-hmm. That was stupid. Very stupid. I owe Mrs. Holton. She hired me even though I was a stay-at-home mom for 14 years. Nobody else would have taken that chance on me. Not a move, or Carl will take care of your little girl. - Mrs. Holton took chances. - Easy. That's probably why she was so successful. She wouldn't be happy I shared that with you. She didn't like when people thought of her as soft. Brooke wasn't just my boss. She wasn't just a business associate to me. Brooke was like a sister. She would light up every room she walked into with a smile and her grace. Can't imagine what the past year must have been like for you. Guess everybody's got their breaking point. I can't tell you how hard it was seeing the light in her eyes disappear. I will love her always. I don't know what to say. My wife was gone long before she took her own life. I just wish Emma or myself could have been enough for her, enough of a reason for her to want to live. She wasn't the only one in pain. I'm angry. I am mad as hell at her for being so selfish and shutting me out. I don't even know if I can do this on my own. Where's Mommy? You said she would be here, but there's only a picture! - Emma, wait! - No! Emma, I am so sorry for bringing you here. [gasps] [muffled scream] That is the last time you're gonna see your husband if he doesn't pay up, I'm tellin' ya right now. 'Cause next time we're gonna add your finger to those rings. Rona, come on! Could I have a drink, please? I could just really use a drink, please. Just a... Just one. No drinks, no booze, no nothing. But it'd make me feel... It'd make me feel better. Just one, that's all. It'd make you-- What? What'd you just say? I said it'd make me feel better. It'll make you feel better? You know, my father used to say that to me. - It made him feel better. - Oh, God. Yeah. Between his 4-martini lunches, his cocktails before dinner, glass of wine before he went to bed. You know, I found my father in the garage, behind the wheel, dead. He killed himself. I just wanted to share that with you. Blood coming out of his nose, his eyes, his mouth. There was a note there. Three words: "Who am I?" 'Cause it made him feel better. Who are you, Ms. Holton? Come on. [knocking] - Yeah? - Hey, it's Will. Hey. Are you okay? Where'd they take you? To, um... [clears throat] a strange and faraway land. We don't have to talk about it. Yeah, my grandpa, he always used to say, "It'll all pass by Christmas." What's your favorite holiday? Christmas. Yeah, mine's definitely Halloween. Me and my dad, we had this game. We used to see who could come up with... the most complicated character mash-up. A costume mash-up? What's that? Well, it's like an Indian Axl Rose in a prison jumpsuit cowboy-zombie-super spy. Try to think of a mash. Well, think of a mash-up. Uh, okay, I'll play your silly little game. [chuckles] A vampire Little Red Riding Hood. Ehh. It's weak. It's too easy. Come on. A vampire Marilyn Monroe dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. - There you go. - Perfect. Okay. Very good. There you go, there you go. Or like a Shakespearean ballerina-bear-rabbi? [laughing] Has there been any news from my husband at all? All I know is I haven't gotten my cut yet. It's been two weeks. Should've had time to talk to the lawyers about how to do it by now. Makes you really wonder, huh? [door opens] WILL: No, no, no, he paid you! No, he paid you! You gotta let me go! No, no, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. You said you would let me go. Don't worry. He's just getting a little bit of bad news. Will? Will. Will, honey, what happened, what happened? - So, my father, he paid them. - No. No, he paid them. He gave them the money, and Jerry said that if it was that easy that he can get more, and that if he doesn't, they're gonna kill me, and then they're gonna go after my mother! - They're not gonna do that. - They're already did it! They killed that Phillip guy next to your cell! That doesn't mean that that's gonna happen to you, okay? I mean, I mean, you have a daughter, right? I mean, we're so screwed. [whimpering] Shh, baby, shh. It's okay. We're gonna get out of here, do you hear me? How? Okay. This is their M.O. They ask for more and more ransom, then they kill us. We're not gonna walk out of here, so we're gonna-- We're gonna-- We're gonna do this, do you hear me? - You trust me? - This place is locked up. They have cameras. They have guns. I mean, how can we get-- We can't get out of here. We'll figure out a way, okay? We'll figure out a way. Will, how far away are we from anything, anything at all? - Do you know? - I don't know, no. Well, when they put me back this last time, we had to stop for gas. It must have been at least a good two hours. Half hour was bumpy, so dirt road. Okay. How far can you run and how fast? Two minutes maybe. I don't know. How far can you run? I used to cross-train, so... When was that? [scoffs] Two minutes! Give me a break. I'll bet you can... run faster and farther than that. Come on.

Well, we knock one of them out, steal the keys, and lock them in. No, there's so much that could go wrong with that, really. We could just stage some kind of distraction, and just take the keys. Mm. Yeah, but they lock us in from the outside. When they leave, they go to lock us, they notice the keys are gone, right? Yeah. We could just make a quick imprint in a peace of soap, and then we could make our own brand-new key from some kind of metal casting. Okay, MacGyver. Let's go. Lunch is over. Come on. [sighs] Come on. Not doing this on my own. [door opens, closes] You training for a marathon? Yeah, just trying to keep our sanity, you know? You think that's a good idea? Clear thoughts in a place like this? What's that gonna bring you? Get a good night's sleep. You're always ready with a smart remark. I got some news for you. Your husband said he's following our instructions. He's dug into some personal funds-- jewelry, artwork, antiques. Really? 'Cause Will said that his father paid you, but you haven't let him go yet, obviously.

I bet he would have been a lot like you. Thought you only had a daughter. Uh, he was killed in a car accident almost a year ago. Because an e-mail was more important than his safety. I never understood why it wasn't me. All I got was a scratch and some bruised ribs. What about your husband and your daughter? They need you too. I mean, they're-- they're still alive. Hmm. Will, we can still do this. Please? Yes. We can go again when Carl's on guard, all right? I found a window without any bars. It's about 30 feet above the ground. - Okay. - Okay?

You're not gonna shoot me. We'll put it down together. Go ahead. [sobs] You really made a mess of things out here. What the hell am I gonna do now? I won't tell anyone anything. I just want to go home. I want to see my family. I want to see my daughter, please. You really mean that? I promise. I can't let you go. [sobs] I promise. Will! Will? Oh, my-- [gasps] Oh, God! I'm gonna go get us help, okay? You hang on! I'm gonna go get help. Help! Help! Oh! Oh! Wait! Wait, please! Oh! Oh, God! Oh, please, please. MAN: Are you okay? Will you take me to the police, please? Of course. Come on, get on in. Thank you. [siren blaring] [police radio chatter] I don't understand. There was-- There were three bodies there. Are you sure this is the right place? My friend Will. I see-- Of course it's the right place! Will! - Will! - Okay. Mrs. Holton! Will? Did you find--? There were monitors there. There were a bunch of monitors. And there was a chain on the door! There was a chain on the door and bars. There were bars on the door! There's nothing. Nothing here. There... There's nothing here. There were rooms that they they locked us in. There were three of them. It's okay, Mrs. Holton. It's not okay. I'm not making this up, I'm not making this up. No one thinks you're making it up. If it happened the way you said it did, we'll find something, okay? All right, thank you, medics. Officers, I'll see you back at the station. - We'll report in. - Yes, sir. Come on. Let's get outta here. - It's okay. - [door closes] - Hey, baby! - Mommy, Mommy! Hi, baby! Hi! Ohh... [sobbing] Hi, honey! I didn't think you'd be gone that long. [laughs] What's she doing here? She's your friend. She wanted to be here. Are you all right? How do you feel? I'm better, thank you. Oh, Brooke, it's, uh, probably not a good time, but we should figure out what we're gonna say to the press. It's not a good time, I don't think. All right, but we should come up with a statement soon. Yeah, uh, it can wait till Monday. Come inside, okay? Since I didn't have access to the escrow, I had to supplement the ransom. I tried to sell all that I could. - Even the Zinardi? - Mm. Especially the Zinardi. [laughs] Where'd they take it? Galleries, private auction, our jeweler. You know, she was a really big help with the ruby ring, diamond earrings. Hey, don't worry about it. We'll get it all back. Oh, I'm sure. I'm tired, Mommy. I know. Why don't you head up to bed, and I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in. Okay. Good night. Good night. Love you. I, uh... I'm still struggling with... I don't understand. I saw them all being shot. I saw... Will was dying, and now there's nothing. There's not a trace. Everything's just vanished. Look, I spoke to the police. They have absolutely no record of a Will Graves being kidnapped. I know they're looking at me like I'm crazy, and I'm not. Albert, I'm not. I know you're not. I'm sorry. You have nothing to be sorry about. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't-- I was... I was frozen. I couldn't move because... because I knew I was responsible that our son was gone. And I was selfish. I just floated away, and I left you to be responsible for everything by yourself, for our baby girl, for everything. I couldn't handle your hurt... and your anger at me because I knew I had taken your son, too. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. It's okay. Who wants chocolate chip pancakes? Me! And eggs? Bacon? Yep and yep. That's a lot of food. You gonna help me? - Morning. - Morning. Ready to face the Inquisition? - As ready as I'll ever be. - You're gonna do great. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you today. Of course, absolutely. My pleasure. This won't take too much of your time, I promise. Good 'cause I want to spend some time with my family. - [chuckling] - Um, Ms. Holton, where were you for the past month? There is still an ongoing investigation, and I have been asked not to comment, so that's what I'll have to say to that. I have to tell her. I feel terrible. - We discussed this. - I can't keep lying to her. It's not the right time. I'll tell her soon, I promise. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you. Thank you. You did fabulous, as usual. Thank you. I'll see you at home. - Yep. - Okay. How did I do? Exceedingly well. Confidence restored. In me or the company? - Both. - Excellent. Mrs. Holton, welcome back. Thank you, Helen. And I would like to apologize for my past behavior. I do hope that you'll forgive me, and that you'll continue working here because I really, really do need you. I was never planning on leaving, Mrs. Holton. Good. All right. I'm gonna call the major clients. Helen, could you answer e-mails for me? But first, I need to take you out to lunch so you can catch me up to speed, yes? - All right. - All right. Is, uh, is Albert in? No, ma'am. Is there something I can help you with? No, Melba, thank you. Hello! Lovely to see you, Mrs. Holton. I'm so glad you're okay. How can I help you today? I actually wanted to know if I could come and buy back some of the jewelry that my husband brought you. Do you know what I'm talking about? I'm not sure, no. There was a ruby ring, some diamond earrings... - No. - Bracelets, yellow gold? I'm sorry. So he didn't bring any jewelry to you? No. No. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Thank you. No, no, thanks. Maybe it isn't any of my business. Your husband did visit the store about a week ago, but not to sell anything. He bought something. He came in with a woman. Really? I'm sorry. Uh, a woman, dark hair, Asian-American. I remember because she was rather striking. All right. That was fun. Hey, Melba, has Mrs. Holton called? No, sir, you just missed her, but she asked for you. - She say where she was going? - No. She put some boxes into the pool house and then she left. Okay. Can you go with Melba for a second, honey? Thank you. Hey. What's going on? I don't know. You tell me. Why were you and Albert at our jeweler's together? I don't know what you're talking about. - There's gotta be some mistake. - No, no. This was like a week ago when I was locked up in the middle of nowhere. And why didn't he sell the artwork? I just saw it in our pool house, gathering dust. He was supposed to sell it and get the money. Why didn't he give them the money, Michelle? Brooke, I don't know. Albert loves you. He would do anything for you. I know Albert loves me. I think Albert loves me. Why are you defending him? - I'm not defend-- - Are you involved in this? I'm not defending him! I'm just saying... he's just trying to do the right thing. Trying to do the right thing? The right thing is to pay the damn ransom. What do you mean, do the right thing? What I'm saying is that there's probably some simple explanation for all this. You're right. There probably is some simple explanation. Are the two of you screwing around behind my back? - What? - Some elaborate scheme to get me out of the picture? Because I gotta tell ya I have seen the two of you whispering and sneaking around. Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I'm blind? - No! - Is it really that difficult for the two of you to figure out how to get a divorce and keep all of our assets? Brooke, you don't understand! I don't understand is right! Then stop lying to me! Do you know what I went through out there? There is nothing like that going on between us. I'm not lying to you! Then prove it to me. Well, this is it. You wanted to know. Michelle, what are you doing? No. Those are the people that kidnapped me! - Brooke, Brooke, it's okay! - No, you don't understand! - It's okay! - Brooke! Brooke, my name is Dr. Tomman. I'm a doctor of psychiatry. Really. This is my team. This is Carl Winfield, Rona Jaworski, and our newest member, Thomas Boswick. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. I'm-- I'm all right. Will... It was a pleasure working with you. - He's okay. - I saw you get shot! Blanks. Squibs. Fake blood. Stop it! Stop it! Done with smoke and mirrors. Little bit of theatrics, a little bit if makeup. Is it working? Come on! Just do something. Make it not work. She can't take Tom with her. They're all actors. Is she looking? Careful, bro, that's a little close. Yeah, but, man, I had to make it look right. Just be careful. [groans] Stunt actors, actually. I'm gonna go get us help. Help! Whoo! Oh, man! Unbelievable! High-five. No, no, no. This is insanity. I don't understand. Why? Because I was losing you, that's why. Brooke, you were spinning out of control, basically drinking yourself to death. I mean, you were a danger to yourself, to Emma. All the therapists you saw, and nothing changed. I didn't know what else to do. We had to put you in immersion therapy, Brooke. What? We believe that you had to face the issues and emotions that you were avoiding head on. This is nuts. What about-- What about rehab, Albert? Forced rehab has a very low success rate, Brooke, because the person knows that sobriety is the end goal. I know. It didn't do a damn thing for me, and God knows I tried. But when the subject is given a different goal like escaping from kidnappers, all the desire to drink or get high melts away. And then we're left with the real issue, your son. Brooke, Dr. Tomman helped a cousin of mine a few years ago. He was a meth addict. Dr. Tomman saved his life. I had no idea how far it would go. Everything was supervised, Albert. Every move your wife made, we were able to adjust to it. We were very flexible. Brooke, look at me. I'm sorry we put you through this. But you were gonna kill yourself. Do you understand that? You were on the road to destruction. I'm sorry we had to do this, but it was the only way for you. It was the only way, Brooke. Why don't you just-- Brooke. Michelle, why'd you bring her here? Brooke! Brooke. Brooke, wait! Please! Wait. I'm sorry. Everything that happened, everything I did, I did for you and for our family. Can you understand that I have no idea anymore what is... what is real? You're real. You are exactly who you used to be. I mean, you're healthy, you're strong, you're vibrant. You are the woman I fell in love with. But I'm not, Albert! I'm not! After all you put me through, I did not come out of that unscathed! I didn't think I had a choice. I, uh, I took your old ring in. What? Michelle helped me choose the cut. I wanted to make you better. I wanted to make us better. You can't make us better. Where do we go from here? We're gonna have to start again, just the three of us. Just the three of us. Now he won't be sad anymore. You did a good job. Say goodbye? Goodbye, Billy. We love you, Billy. We love you, Billy. Go home?
