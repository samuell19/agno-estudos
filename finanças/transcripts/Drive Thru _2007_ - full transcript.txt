What time'd you guys find the car? Uh, we rolled up about 6 A.M. And besides the obvious, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Uh, anything at all? No, not really. There was a song playing' on the stereo. That's not out of the ordinary. Bunch of kids partyin', Numb nuts. What was the song? Highway to Hell. Styx. Paradise Theater. Great album. Mmm. That'd be AC/DC, sir. Sergeant... I was rockin' it while you were still shittin' yourself, so... Dwayne... It was AC/DC. Hey, Janet, I want you to take the truck, Get it to the chop shop ASAP.

Yeah, I saw that episode of CSI too, Dwayne. No. Actually, I just want to get it outta here before the press comes-- I'm on the scene with detectives Chase and Crackers Of the Blanca Carne Police Department. Yeah, actually, it's Crockers. - No. We have no comment. You know what? - C-R-O-C-K-E-R-S. You need to clear this crime scene right now. Right now. Clear the crime scene. - Thank you. Thank you. - I'll talk. You're not gonna talk, Dwayne. You think Barella can do it again this year? Listen, if Jumba's gonna regain the form that won him the world title in '05 And take down points, Leader McMillis, He's gotta spend more time.. A $400 noise citation? And you have to appear in court? Whatever possessed you? Mom, it was just a little get-together for graduation that got out of hand. Relax, Marcia. I mean... You know how kids are. Hell, I remember in the day - We used to-- - Bill, please. Do not encourage Mackenzie's reckless behavior. Mom, you're overreacting. How do you expect me to react? I mean, you trash the house, embarrass us in front of the neighbors, And to top it all off, you lose your brand new camera. Mom, it was just one party, and my camera's probably around here somewhere. All right, kids. How do you like your burgers? Well done, please. Bloody as hell, Mr. Carpenter. Same here, Mr. C. Outstanding choice. How 'bout you, Mac? Flesh-free, dad. Oh, sweetie, it's a beautiful piece of meat. Not as beautiful as when it was mooing in some pasture. There was a time when my hypocrite parents wouldn't touch meat. So much for the old flower child image. Well, you know what they say. If you're 20 and you're not a Liberal, you don't got a heart. And if you're not Republican when you're 50, you got no money. Selling out the sixties like the rest of the Baby Boomers. Oh, check this out. I love this. Watch. It's great. True, pony is strong again. Jack Benjamin here. Try my new Hella Monster chili burger. It's one Hella burger. Good afternoon, I'm Anita Hill. A predawn tragedy has hit this quiet community of Blanca Carne. I'm here at Blanca Carne beach, Where the police discovered this Cadillac Escalade at 6 A.M. this morning. The inside of the car was drenched with blood. But as of yet, no bodies have been found. Hey! Hey, you guys, come check this out. Hey, man, that's Brandon Meek's ride. Dumb-ass wigger probably got his cap peeled back by some real gangbangers. Oh, my God. Dad, rewind that part. Wait. Stop. My God. This is so trippy. - What are you gonna do? - Nothing. Don't you think we should tell someone? No way, they'll either think we're stoned or had something to do with it. Yeah, and let's hope the police don't find out they were at the party. Oh, great! They were here? Yeah You know... Fish is right. Take this secret to the grave. Okay? Besides, it was just probably a weird coincidence, anyway. P.A.: Attention, Seniors. Senior blood drive is this afternoon at 3 P.M. in the gym. Don't forget to bring your permission slips from home. - Hey. - Hey. Wanna come over tonight? I can't. I'm way behind on my yearbook photos, And... my camera's still missing. Someone must've stolen it. Let's find out. Did Mac's expensive camera get jacked? Hmm. How 'bout this? Since Mac is turning 18 this weekend... Will I finally get to tap that barely legal ass? - Ugh! - Ohh! Is Fisher Kent a hopeless perv with shit for brains? Yes. I gotta get to class. - Ok. - Later. Bye. Mmm... Should I... go to class or get baked in the bathroom? Who are you? Why are you doing this? It's about time. What's with the radio silence today? - Sorry, I'm a little freaked out. - What's wrong? I think I might be losing it. - Yeah? So, what else is new? - Knock it off. I'm serious. Oh, sorry. Hey, listen... Why don't you come over tonight? We can do some girly shit, and you can check out my new ink. Ohh...Shit. I forgot. What'd you get? - Oh, I'm not telling. - Is it fly? Oh, girlfriend, it's superfly. TNT. Listen, I gotta jam, but I'll call you later. Ok? Hello? Hello? Writin' one of your famous Left-Wing, radical, anti-establishment articles for the paper, are you? Oh. Yeah. Um... After the Fascist editorial staff censors it, it'll be more like a tabloid horoscope. How you doin' Lenny? Good. Good. Ahh, I got the hemorrhoids something' fierce. They're burnin'! - God, they burn. - Hey, Lenny, um... You know... I would love to chit chat with you, But, Um... actually, I got a lot of work to do. Oh. me, too. Me, too. I gotta go pull a brown gator that's cloggin' up the staff shitter. Now, I come... 'cause I got a present for you. Oh, my God! My camera! Lenny, where did you find this? You don't wanna know. Thank you! Hmm. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My God. - Say "cheese" - Aaahhh! Aah! Aah! Hello, Mackenzie. Beginning to get the picture?! Aah! Aah! Aah! Where do you think you're goin'? Aah! Aah! Aah! Ooh! Aaahhh! Hahahahaha! Aaahh! This party's just getting started, girlfriend! Aaahhh! Aaahhh! Aaahhh! P.A.: Attention. P.A.: Attention, students. Blanca Carne High School lunch menu for Friday, April 12... Val Carbonara! Val! No! No! No! No! Please, God, No! No! Ohh! No! Aaahhh! Aaahhh! Aah! Uhh! Fuck! Mackenzie, I'm lonely. You know you want my horn dog in your hot little buns. I'm calling the cops! You're not gonna be lonely When you're getting gang-raped in your prison cell every night! Heh heh heh! No one can help you. You're my girl now. And I'm horny! Aah! Aah! Oh, Lenny, please help me! Aaaahhhh! Aah! Aah! It's time to double your pleasure. Get two orders of my triple-X Hella-Hot Wings for the price of one. Now, that's a money shot. How many times do I have to tell you? It was a 7 foot Horny the Clown chasing me with a meat cleaver. I can't believe you guys think Lenny did this. That's insane. Mr. Schwartz had an extensive criminal record. He also had your camera, which was stolen the night Brandon Meeks & his friends disappeared. Not to mention he offed himself. Textbook murder/suicide scenario. - So that's it, then? - Yeah. For now. Lenny couldn't find his ass with both hands. Explain to me how he could possibly pull this off. Is he a fucking magician or something? Mackenzie, just try to calm down, honey. Sweetheart, I think it's time for you to go home and get some rest. We'll take it from here. - You don't believe anything I've told you. - Whether we believe you or not is irrelevant. We have very little physical evidence to back up your story about Val. No clow suit, no microwave. Hello! The guy gave me Brandon Meeks' license plate number before he disappeared. And the exact description of Val's tattoo before she died. What? Huh? The guy with talking board games and magic balls? Let me ask you somethin'. Do you do any kind of drugs, Ms. Carpenter? - Up yours, detective Crackers. - Ok, it's Crockers, young lady-- - Crackers. - Detective, our daughter does not do drugs. - Do I need to call our lawyer? - I'm outta here. I'm sorry. Ooh! - Relax. I come in peace. - Oh, shit. You try and relax with Ronald McStalker on your ass. I'm sorry about Val. I can't believe she's gone. This whole thing is so fucking bizarre! - Who would do something like this? - Better yet, how? - He must be psychic or something. - No, it's more than that. - He knows us. - Wait, what the fuck do you mean? - He's watching. - Hey, take it easy, Mac. All right? - Star's about to lose her shit. - I'm sorry, sweetie. I've already lost my shit. What I want to know is, what's this got to do with Horny the Clown? I grew up with that lovable son of a bitch. It's like finding out Captain Kangaroo's got pieces of Mr. Green Jeans in his freezer. Mr. Benjamin. I'm detective Chase. This is my partner, Detective Crockers. - Blanca Carne Police Department. - What can I do for you? Well, we have reason to believe that the perpetrator of the recent homicides may have been wearing a Horny the Clown costume. - Well, Chase and Crackers... - Yeah, it's Crockers. That's what I said. Please, why don't you join me in my office. Maybe we should discuss it there. Oh, those poor kids. Has the press found out about the clown suit? No, we have a press blackout on this case. 'cause I've got thousands of those damn things in circulation. I mean, for commercials and whatnot. If one went missing, I'd never hear about it. Don't worry, Jack, yes. This will not hurt your business in any way. Do you know a man by the name of Lenny Schwartz? Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. Do you think he stole the clown suit? Well, w-we're not at liberty to discuss that-- Police business and all. You understand. We found Hella Burger bags in the first victim's car. With your permission, we'd like to see the security tapes from both Blanca Carne restaurants the night they disappeared. I wish I could help you out, but those cameras are just for show. I guess I'm too cheap to buy a real system, but don't tell anyone. Thank you for your time, Mr. Benjamin. You think of anything, you give us a call. Whoa! The original Horny! I remember him. Wonder who that lucky little shit was. My son. Ok. Ok. Uhh... Is he still bein' Horny-- D--playin' Horny? Archie? No. He hasn't done that since he was a kid. He's um... Passed away now. Oh. Well the new one's got some shoes to fill. Hey, could I get your autograph, Jack? - Of course, yeah. - Right... there. - Detective. - No words. Just the name, huh? - It's an autograph, Crackers. - A-actually, it's Crockers. - Like I said. - Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Benjamin. - Lot of people make that mistake. - All right, here we go, Dwayne. Just take it outside. - Aah! Oh, you bastard! - You knew I was comin' over. What the hell are you listening to? Oh. Highway to Hell. Tryin' to see if there are any backwards, satanic messages on it. It was playing in Brandon Meeks' Escalade when they found it. - What? - You know, like in all those old 70s songs? Try to see if there's some kind of clue in it. Mac, all that backwards, satanic message stuff is bullshit. That's not what I read. Jesus! There are 7 backwards messages, and all of them are about Satan? See? So, along with finals, and being old enough for the draft, which will happen, Now I got the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness to worry about. Fisher! - Put that down and back away. - Sorry. Mmhh... Mmm... Why don't you give me my birthday present. - Your birthday isn't until tomorrow. - I don't have it. Think you do. My parents see you come in? Door was open. Put on something loud just in case. - Honey? - What? Go away! Why is the door locked? Is Fisher in there with you? No, Mom! I'm getting dressed for the carnival. Oh, sweetie. You know, we'd really rather you not go. After all that's happened. Mom, please! We talked about this! This is the last big school event of the year, and everyone is gonna be there. Plus, I have to work the haunted house for yearbook club. All right, but, um... Hi. Are you sure you want to? I mean, I respect your-- Uhhh... I think we've been respectable long enough. I'll be damned if I'm gonna die a virgin. Mmm... Mmm... Oh, look. Tina McCandless and Chad Baldwin. You mean Aberzombie and Bitch. God, this place is lame tonight. Probably explains why you losers are working here. Are you supposed to be scary, Fish face? Oh, not as scary as the dockers you have halfway up your ass, Chad. How'd you like my foot all the way up your ass? I'm sure what you meant to say was "dick." So, um, do you and your sub-pop want to buy, like, a ticket or what? Uhh! Sweet costume, Mac. I was beginning to suspect you were a lesbo. Now I'm sure. Well, as long as the gene pool is filled with bottom feeders like you, I have to keep my options open. - Ew, gross! What a fucking bitch! - Fuck - Who needs her? - Duty calls! Aaahhh. Ohh! I told you to, like, wait for me, Chad. I couldn't help it. You're just too sexy. Yeah, right. False start fraggin'. Hahahahaha! Hahahahaha! Haha! Hahaha! Yeee Hahahaha! Shit, Chad, my prada is fucking soaked! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaahh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! - Aah! - Break it up! Welcome to Horny's Funhouse! You oughta tell that dude to-- Aaahh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! See, Fisher?! Fast food kills, fucker. Bill, do you have to eat the Hella-Monster's slop... whatever burger? It looked so good on TV. Oomp! - Can we please go? - Ohh, excuse me. Ohhh... Marcia? Marcia Johnson. Burt? Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in forever. Hi, it's Marcia Carpenter now. Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, this is my husband Bill and my daughter Mackenzie. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. We were friends in high school. Burt and I. - Oh, so you went to Blanca Carne. - Um, San Guano, actually. My daughter goes to, uh, Blanca Carne. She's about your age, Mackenzie. Oh! Yeah, right. Tina. I know her. She's a... Terrific girl. I just saw her at the haunted house. I'm working it this year. Right! Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Um, did you hear about... Tori Meeks' kid? Um, Mackenzie's best friend, Valerie Espinoza disappeared last week. She's Grace Overstreet's daughter. That's weird. So... you two knew the parents of both victims? I better catch up with Tina. It's good to see you, Marcia. - Nice meeting you. - Oh. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Hmm. My God, Mac. You gotta come quick. - What? - The haunted house. It's, like, broken down or something. I don't know and I cannot find Fisher. Fisher? Hello? Is there anyone in here? Anybody? Is anyone in here? Hello? Is there anyone in here? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - That was ok, bitch. - Fuck, no! - Aaahh! - Aah! Oh, my God! Fisher! Fisher! Fisher, are you ok?! What? I want to go with him. Not tonight. Not tonight, Mackenzie. You need to go home, get a couple hours' sleep, and maybe you can see him tomorrow. Uhh... Shit! Oh, my God. We got Jones over there on the crime scene. Forensics is hittin' it hard, so... But I don't know. I mean, we're supposed to buy this shit? Hey, where do you think you're goin'? - I'm here to see my friend, Fisher. - Yeah, well, there are no visitors allowed. I have to see him. Fisher! Listen, cool it, you little brat! Take your hands off my daughter, sir! - Mom, what are you doing here? - You can let her go. You two, come with me. Mackenzie. What the hell do you think you're doing? I could ask you the same question. Why are cops guarding Fisher's room? You can't possibly think that he's responsible for this. I have two more missing kids on my hands, and Fisher is my only eyewitness. One of them is Tina McCandless, isn't it? - How do you know that? - Same way I knew about the others. - This time-- - Uh-uh. You stop right there. If I try and check one of your possessed toys into evidence, they'll have my badge. - Why won't you believe me? - How do you know I don't? Because the lynch mob is gatherin' around Fisher with their torches and pitchforks. We're just questioning him at this point. Don't give me the same line of bullshit you're giving the press. Mackenzie, calm-- I'm sorry. Mackenzie? Mackenzie? Mackenzie. Would you please talk to me? Are you ever planning to tell the police that the parents of all the victims are your old buddies? What's that got to do with anything? You're joking, right? Mother, it's a very definitive pattern. That's what it's got to do with everything. It's more like an awful coincidence, Mackenzie. Mother... I know you're not as stupid as you've been pretending to be for the past few years. Don't talk to me like that, Mackenzie. Then you start talking to me! Oh, you are so closed off! But I know there's something eating you up inside. I can see it in your eyes. Yes, well, I'm worried about you, And I wish that the police knew something. They don't know shit! But you do! I don't know more than anybody else, and I resent the accusation that I'm withholding information. Thou doth protest too much, mother. Mackenzie, can we please talk about this at home? I am not interested in talking to someone who doesn't care enough about Fisher to speak up and refuses to accept the fact that I could be next! Fine. The girl working the funhouse didn't see anyone else but Fisher Kent go in. That was right before my daughter was taken. Why would he want to hurt Tina? I don't know! Why don't you do your job and go ask him?! I already have. But right now... I have some questions for you. You knew Marcia Carpenter in high school, right? Yes. What about Tori Meeks and Grace Overstreet? Yeah, so what? All of the missing children are the sons and daughters of your friends. - Doesn't that strike you as odd? - I--I don't understand. Why would someone dressed as Horny the Clown want to hurt your children? Um... uh... I have no idea. Well, that's a lie, and you know it. Mr. McCandless, your daughter is missing. And if you don't help me, I may never find her. I don't even know where to start. Try starting from the beginning. Huh?! What-- What the hell's goin' on in here? You better not be tryin' any shit with me, boy. Your daddy might've brought you in this world, but I'll take you out. You gonna eat that? Oh, hell yeah. Your balls are showin'. Detective Chase, it's happening! Aaahh! - Oh, Fisher! What the fuck? - Shh! Let's get outta here. Where do you wanna go? You can't go home. I can lay low with Van for a while. What do you want to do? I have to figure out how my mom and her friends are connected. It's obvious he intends to whack us all. Maybe he only wants revenge. Most parents, mine excluded, of course, would rather die than see their kids get killed. What the hell could a bunch of pasty, O.C. socialites have done to piss him off like this? "See you at 4:20." You know anyone with a "4:20" tattoo? I bet it's not a tat. This fucker's into variety. Hold on a sec. - Yo, Van, what's up? - Dude, you're on the news. Hey, do you know anybody with a "4:20" tattoo Or, a board graphic or something with 4:20 on it? Yeah, 4:20 Boys. Uh, Chuck Taylor's group. Oh, right! Those fags! Uh, thanks, man. I'll call you back. Snap. 4:20 Boys. Hey, look, stop hoggin' it. Yeah. Fuckin' burnouts! Always came in last at the local team events. This guy, Chuck Taylor, tried to steal my deck once. Oh, my God. That's my mom's high school boyfriend's name. - Are you serious? - The legendary Charlie Taylor. - Where we goin'? - While you lay low with Van, Marcia and I are gonna have a "come to Jesus." - Hey, fuckers. - Huh? Let's hit the Fun Space. It's so necessary. All right, whatever. Hey, kids! Welcome to the Hella Burger Fun Space. This Fun Space is for kids 12 and under, So make sure your folks are here.

Ohh! Oh, my... I'm on the scene of what appears to be yet another grisly murder In what appears to be the most heinous case of serial murder... Mackenzie! Where the hell have you been? Your father's been driving around looking for you. We've been worried sick! Not as worried as Charles Taylor's gonna be, I'll bet. Hmm? How did you... Mackenzie? What are you looking for? This. I could take it to detective Chase, if you want Maybe you'll talk to her. Hmm? I'm so scared. Why would someone... want to murder the children of your friends? When I was young... I did something terrible. I had this... crazy group of friends. And none of us went to the same schools, But we used to hang out together in the Summers. My old boyfriend... Charlie Taylor Tori Hill... Brandon Meeks' mom. Burt McCandless, the man you met at the carnival. And Grace... Val's mom. There was this young man... Archie Benjamin. Jack Benjamin's son. Hella Burger Jack Benjamin? Archie didn't have any friends. He was... An extremely strange boy. And we loved to torment him. But despite our cruelty, he was totally obsessed with me. It got so bad that he dropped out of school, And he spent all his time working with his father. He was in every one of those stupid old commercials. It was his entire indentity, his claim to fame. But then something happened. Archie died in a fire. And the police said it was an accident. But it was no accident. How do you know? Because we killed him. It was the night of his 18th birthday, and he'd sent me an invitation. Happy birthday. Archie. But we just laughed and used it to roll joints. Charlie hated him because of his crush on me. And so he convinced everyone that we should crash Archie's party. And play a prank on him. Aah! Archie died... In that fire. The police always thought it was an accident. And you... Your friends, you never told anyone? No. We were terrified of getting into trouble. And we wanted so bad to believe it wasn't our fault. But deep down, I knew that it was. And now... Now we are paying for our sins. You're paying? Hardly, mom. Last time I checked, the crosshairs were on my head. And my 18th birthday is tomorrow. I won't let anything happen to you. I'm calling detective Chase. I want you in protective custody. I am not putting my life in their hands. They have no idea what they're dealing with. I will tell them what we did. It's Jack Benjamin. He's taking from us what we took from him. Ohh... It's not Jack Benjamin, can't you see that? It's Archie. Mackenzie, where are you going? I'm going to talk to Jack Benjamin, The one person who might be able to stop him. Shh. Shh Shh Shh. Ok, what the hell is all this crap, Rambo? It's insurance, man. check this shit out. If we find Horny, I got just about everything we need to kill his clown ass. A plastic tent stake? Yeah, well, um... they didn't-- They didn't have any wooden ones at the Army Surplus store. What am I gonna do? Ok, he's not a vampire, fuck-wad. Yeah, man. If you think a Ghetto Paint-By-Numbers Jesus is gonna stop him, you're fuckin' smokin' crack. Hey, fuck you, guys. At least I came prepared. I mean, we could be dealin' with fuckin' anything here. Right, Mac? That's why I brought the silver bullets. - Oh, shit! - Where the hell did you get this? It's my dad's from when he was in the Army. Do you know how to shoot this thing? How hard can it be, right? Fisher: Shit. What's this? Bit of courage. Yeah, pass that shit over.

Yes, I know Jack Benjamin is a pillar in the community, judge, but I assure you this is not a frivolous search warrant. Yes, I can establish motive. His son was killed by the parents of the missing children. And he lied to us about it. It's all in my report. Yes. Yes, thank you, your honor. Ok, G.I. Joe.
