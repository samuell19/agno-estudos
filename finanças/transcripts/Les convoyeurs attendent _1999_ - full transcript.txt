...at Pont-Sainte-Maxence, visibility is good, light winds from the southwest... On to Li?ge, foggy, we're waiting... THE CARRIERS ARE WAITING Soignies, the carriers are waiting... Florennes, overcast, good visibilty, winds out of the northwest... ...release starting at 7:30... ...they're waiting... ...finally, in Chimay, the carriers are waiting. Dear lit-tle fath-er! I will... I will tell you... a great sec-ret! You are the tree in my for-est! I... I'll be-come a bird To rest in your branch-es! I'll be-come a cloud To hide in your fo-li-age I'll be-come wind To tell you... To tell you... ev-er-y day Words of love Look at this guy... Joe Banana. He ate 52 bananas in 2 and a half minutes. Roger, you're not going to eat 52 bananas in 2 and a half minutes. No, no, of course I won't eat 52 bananas, I know. What I'm saying mom, is this contest is for ANY record. - Any record. - We must be realistic. Sure, I'm not saying we'll pull trucks with our teeth, But there must be a record in the book within our grasp. That's all. I'm not speaking Chinese. But it takes training. No problem. The contest is in 6 months. We prepare like anyone else. In 6 months you can build cathedrals. Wouldn't you like a nice car? Eh? If dad had a nice car, Louise? There. It's about finding a suitable record. We're no dumber than anyone else. Look. "The World Champion seed spitter is Richard Hahn from Wisconsin." "He spat a seed 14.71 meters in 1976." 14.71 meters. That's a lot. Do we have apricots? There are olives left in the fridge. - With pits? - Yes. Louise, get the olives for daddy. If we sit on our butts, nothing will happen. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I say we can win this car. I was out of breath. Michel, go to the door. - Why? - Do what I say. To the door. Listen up, it's not complicated, when I say go, open the door, close it again, come back to me and close. - So I go through? - Yes, you open a door. As quickly as possible, Michel. Alright? Okay, ready? Go! Faster, Michel. Faster. Hurry! Hurry! Stop! 8 openings in 15 seconds. 8 doors in 15 seconds, Michel! That's 32 openings in 1 minute. So over one hour. That makes 1 780, times 24 for a total of... 32 780 openings in 24 hours. And the world record is 41 827. With a well-oiled door, Michel you're the new World Champion. Hmm? What do you think? Would you like to be a champion? He doesn't feel like it. What about me? Think I want to? Think I enjoy reporting on an old rotten motorcycle? His idleness won't buy me a car. What he wants, or doesn't want we don't care. As long as I live here, he'll do what we ask. Doesn't feel like it... When it's time to goof off, he often feels like it. She's not eating? She doesn't want to go to rehearsal, there's a run in her stockings. A run in her stockings? You're both driving me crazy. Where is the run? Can't tell me yourself? Show me the run? Get up. Where's the run? There. That's not a run, that's a snag. Yes, it's open. What is it? The wind blew your laundry into my garden. Good evening, Felix. Thank you. What is it? Is that yours, mama? What are you doing with my wife's bra, Felix? Did you jerk off on it? Well then, big lingerie expert, see anything on my daughter's stockings? Do your dance steps, Louise. She's a majorette! Do your steps, then we'll see if there's run or not. Go ahead! See? He doesn't see it either. No run. Chief Charlie 1, over. Charlie 1, I read you. Urgent intervention. In Walcourt. Stationmaster called. They found an illegal under a train. Walcourt Station, an illegal immigrant. We'll go have a look. More precisely, it's Track 2. The train is on Track 2. Louise, put on your helmet. You're coming with daddy. Sir? He can't hear anything. Three days under a train, the noisy rumbling... He's become deaf. - Do we know where he's from? - No. Surely an Albanian. They come by shiploads now. This one took the train. Well. I can't take a photo like this. I can't photograph a man without a head. So if we move him? Take off his coat? I can't shoot him like this, that doesn't make any sense. Leave him alone if he doesn't want his picture taken. Take off the coat, five minutes? Five minutes, then right back. Who cares? Nobody will see him. Leave him alone. Alright, forget it. Do you have coffee? Yes. Better that way. Deadly Roadway - What's a golden anniversary? - Where do you see that? Here. "Golden Anniversary in Gilly." Look how they seem to love each other. How can you tell? How her hand is on his hand. How he looks at her. You see his smile? it's true, they do seem in love. Are they in the paper for being in love? No, it's because they have been married for 50 years. That's a golden anniversary. So someday you and dad will also be in the newspaper? Yes, someday. In how long? In 34 years. 34 years... Hey! There he is! Show us your back. Come on, let's see your back. Martin doesn't believe you were burned with cigarettes as a child. So if Martin mimics a Somali, you show your back? Do your Somali, Martin. Good enough. He imitated a Somali, so now let's see your back. Michel? What? Can you hear that? What? Listen. They're burning babies with cigarettes. Some laundry blew in your garden. I'll go see. Nice, aren't they? I have 12 more stored in the back. Look at this one. Nice, huh? They misspelled my name. Too bad. I have to go. Chief Sierra 4, I read you. The motorcycle kid died on the way to the hospital. Keep the crash scene secure and keep the driver there. Hi there, Roger. How are you? - This man is responsible. - Good evening, sir. Roger Closset. I work for L'Espoir newspaper. May I ask a few questions? - May I have your name, sir? - Gianuzzi. - Gianuzzi. - Could you spell it? George, Isidore, Albert... No, no, it's easier with just the first letter. If you start with all names, I'm spelling George when you say Isidore. I get a bit confused. So it's easier to with the first letter. - G... I... - I. A... N... U... Z... Z... I. Gianuzzi. This is for you. They say you can't misspell proper names, but if I get your name wrong you'll be the first to complain. He's right, they often are the first to complain. So we do things right, then we can rest easier. - Has he been drinking? - Doesn't seem so. Negative. You didn't see him? So listen... everything seems in order. I'll just take a photo. Could you hold up his identity card? It's for the readers. They want to see the victim's face. Like that. Hold it in front of you. A bit higher? So the interior light hits it? Eyes straight ahead. Very good. A bit higher. One... Wait, your finger is hiding the face. Could you move your finger? Louise, what if you got a bread? C'mon, go grab a bread. Go on. No... Take a baguette instead. Silence! Go ahead, Boris. "Popcorn" comes from the English. "Pop" means "?clater" and "corn" means "ma?s". Continue. On with the experiment, then. So Louise? When will we hear your talk about honey? I won't be about honey but pigeons. May I come in? This is Napoleon. He won all those trophies. It's nice? Barcelona. That's where he going. But he must also fly back. We show him to his mate. That he comes back for. Want to see them? Yes. Come. Look carefully. That's his mate. I put her with a different male. See it? Look how jealous he is. He pecks at it. See how jealous he is? So you can send him to Barcelona and he'll come right back. He won't waste any time. Bring him back to the kitchen, I'll clean the pigeon coop. You know, it's not his fault. He was burned with cigarettes when he was little. Move forward, sir, please. Perfect. Come in, girlie. Stand beside the gentleman. A bit closer. Well done. And now a bit towards me. Sir, your collar is crooked. Straighten your collar. The other side also. Now pull your jacket down. Perfect. Hold the pigeon more in profile towards the girl. Girlie, hold the cup better, it's falling. Good hold. Higher. Very good. And now a beautiful smile. You also sir. Now we choose the moment. Well done. A beautiful smile. Hop, very good. Another one. You also need to smile, sir. Good, thank you. What do we say, guys? Bravo, Felix! Bravo, Felix. How's it going? You brought your fans? Show him. The champion. Sort of scrawny, eh? Yet he screws us every week. What are you eating? What do you feed him? What does he feed him? Do you have a trick? Soft, eh? Look. Soft like that girl's pussy, see? Is that how you caress her? If you need engagement money, just let me know. Felix... I'll take your pigeon for 100 000. No more risks, contests. He just needs to screw and make little Napoleons. In ten years he'll still be here. You can come and caress him. 100 000. Cash. Don't miss out on this. One day it'll go away and never return. Hi Michel. Everything alright? Three seconds, mom, you're on. Good evening, Michel, and welcome to Radio Chevauchoir at 105.5. I wish you a nice show as to all your listeners listening in. Thank you, Simone. And now to begin the show the segment "Lies In Cinema." Chevauchoir FM, the program we love. So Michel, many blunders in the movies this week? I found one in the film 'Les Voleurs.' Alex, the protagonist, buys sandwiches. He asks the cashier the price, she says: "42 francs". He tends a 50 francs note. She gives him one coin back, that's the problem. There are no 8 franc coins. That's the gaffe. Thank you, Michel. Watch carefully. Look, it's right here. Look at the guy in the middle. Only his movements. He puts jam on. Still don't see it? Wait, here it comes. Here, look. There's no more jam on his bread. Exactly. One more error for my program. Michel. Come with me, I have a surprise for you. - Come, I said. - I'm preparing my program. Forget your program, come with me. Richard, this is my son Michel. Michel...your trainer. He costs me 400 per hour. For that kind of money I expect a serious effort. What is it? What? He's fat, is that it? Richard has glandular problems. That's right, Richard? Give me your hands. Yeah, they're sweaty. Grasp the handle and hold it firmly. Holding it firmly? Real strong? Sweaty hands don't grip. Give me your hands. Give your hands. Rub. Grasp the handle firmly now. Have it firmly? Real strong? This gains us a door a minute. You'll get your car. Thank you, Richard. Go sit down. You do whatever. Grab the door and just do whatever. - What? - Are you listening? No, you're playing with the dog. Listen to him. I don't pay a trainer for you to goof around. Sorry, Richard. Continue. You're all over the place. You must structure your movements, like a dancer. Two positions. Position A: Feet apart facing the door. Position B: Perpendicular. Resumes the same positions. A-B. A-B. Half hour later he's sweating like a pig. That's normal at the beginning. He must first eliminate all his toxins. With the new technique we gain 2 more doors per minute. That means by midnight we'd be at 18... So we'd be ahead... by 497 doors for the record. We have some leeway. So you can finish smoother. You manage your fatigue better. - Are you sure? - Well look. - I trust you. - Dad! - What is it? - The newspaper called you for a photo. A photo of what? - Soft cheeses. - Soft cheeses? I think so. See how I must earn my living? I'll leave you with Michel. Come with me, Louise. Foot positions. Go for it. - Go ahead. - Leave me. Michel? Jocelyne wants to date you. Jocelyne? You're not talking? You aren't talking either. Tell me, Jocelyne... Did you like when I moved my finger around your breast? Tell me. Maybe I went too fast. It's not even my idea. I read it in 'Couples In Harmony.' It's a magazine in which doctors give advice... To properly make love. For example... they say the breasts are a 'heterogeneous' zone. That means... if I stroke you there, that you should like it. Is it complicated to do that?! Is it complicated?! No. You're just not trying! You don't have a winner's mentality! Clearly if you tell yourself you'll fail, we will not succeed, that's for certain. - But I have blisters. - What? What did you say? Don't take me for a fool. That's just an excuse so you can do nothing. - But look... - No! You just don't want to, so stop making things up. He'll never make it. You know what his problem is? He has no self-confidence. He has never had any and never will. At school, same thing. He can't even walk without tripping. My son is a loser, Richard. We must give up. No, I don't agree with you. Roger, look at me. Look at me. Roger, look at me. Roger, confidence can be learned. - Go get the neighbours. - What? Go get the neighbours. Go get neighbours, go! No, wait, wait. Michel, stop. - Do you know what you're doing? - Of course, Roger. - Shouldn't we extend our hands? - No, he must fall. But those two mattresses aren't going to save him. You catch him at the last minute, that's the idea. He must have confidence in himself. And therefore he must trust you. - Is that an American technique? - Yes. Okay...Well, Michel. Here we go. Michel, stop looking like like a dog shitting and jump. Okay? - That's it. Were you scared? - No. - Were you scared? - No. You did it because you trusted yourself. True, isn't it? The door is the same. With confidence you can succeed. - Understand? - Yes. Grow your moustache now. - Do it like daddy. - Yes. Good boy. Let's have a drink. Louise! Louise, stay in rhythm. You're not in rhythm. Concentrate. like a bird that sings... - Give me a kiss. - No... - Give me a kiss now. - No. A little one. Dad, can we go home? - Can we go home? - What's wrong? Home. She's worse than the wife. What is it, my sweet? Are you bored? What is it, nothing to do? You should have fun. Wait, isn't today a special celebration? - Carnival. - Carnival, I know. Think a moment, Louise. Look at me. - Isn't it a special day? - Father's Day. Father's Day. And what do we do on Father's Day? Look at me. What do we do on Father's Day? Hold this a minute. One moment. Quiet! My daughter has prepared a poem. Louise, we're listening. Dear little father! Dear little father! I will tell you a great secret. You are the tree in my forest. I'm the tree of nothing, I can't hear you. Nobody can hear. You must carry your voice to be heard. Go on. Dear little father... Dear little father. I will tell you a great secret. You are the tree in my forest. I'll become a bird. To rest in your branches. I'll become a cloud to hide in your foliage. I'll become wind... Louise, wait! Wait, Louise! Here. Look. You fill in your name. Fill in your name. And you write "Belgium". That means "Belgique". So when your balloon goes to a far country like China or what have you, they know where your balloon came from. Can it go to Barcelona? Further, even. You know Laurent? Dochain's son... Well, found a card that came from Morocco. And Morocco is far. You'll release it. - Wish it a good trip. - Bon voyage. Shouldn't there be lights? - Yes. - A spotlight? With music? Is there music? When should I start? - Is there a signal to... - You'll see. There's a signal. Ladies and gentlemen... before you is a man who will claim a new world record in the opening and closing of doors... Michel! Could I get a thunderous round of applause? Bravo, Michel! Looking great in yellow and red. You look completely relaxed. His trainer, welcome! Welcome! And at the end of this record, of this effort waiting for you is a car with a 1300cc engine cloth seats and sports hubcaps, offered by the merchant association. Just one question, Michel. To become a legend how many times must you open and close the door? 41 828 times. Indeed, since the current record is ... 41 827 times. Yes, the record held by Jack Sunderland from Cardiff, who must be trembling in his native Wales. So, we won't be going to bed early tonight? Please concentrate. To verify the record, Mr. Bewir. And some applause! And to guide you and support Michel in this great effort: Erika and her musicians. Music! Attention, Michel. Countdown. Five...four...three...two...one! We're off! Please encourage him. Michel! Michel! Michel! He'll break this record, Already at 26... 27... 28... It's going very well, I feel it. I'm sure. Do you see something? See something when I do this? Louise, you see something when I do this? And now? - Now they're brighter. - It's different, yes? See, you have two light levels. That's nice. Come on, Roger. Louise, come kiss. Come give daddy a kiss. Daddy has a nice car, huh? - I'm not going to make it. - Sure you will, you'll see. You sure? You know...Jocelyne... When I'm in the record book, I'll ask your father for your hand. We have no money. That's okay, we'll live upstairs. There's only one doorbell. We'll put two name cards up. Two times to ring for us, once for the parents. Come, Mich, gotta go! You're doing well. Keep it up. Go! Go! A-B! C'mon! A-B! Very good, Mich. Keep it up. Come on, breathe, breathe. Big breath, Michel. Well done. - My feet are sore. - What? - My feet are sore. - Think about the record. We're at pace, no time to slow down. Come on, breathe! Breathe! Okay? Let's go! C'mon! A-B. ...It's no great loss for cycling. Still no fun for the guy losing a leg. But you Richard, you could have been a champion. Yes. You were a swift arrow. You had the stature of a Sercu or a De Vlaeminck. But you privileged your personal life over your emotional life. Right? And what did that woman give you? Nothing but misery, Richard. Nothing but misery. That's true. You're not a bad egg, just quarrelsome when you drink. No, people shouldn't mess with me, that's all. Just not get in my face, that's the only thing. That's no philosophy, Richard. Dad? - What is it? - My feet are sore. - What is it? - My legs hurt. That's normal, Michel. You can't stop now. Look! You have 9 148 doors, that's a quarter finished. You're making a good score, he was just telling me. You can't stop. You want something to eat? A banana? Want a banana? Louise, get daddy's bag. Eat a banana, it'll give you vitamins. That gives you strength. Eat your banana. Eat slowly, you'll digest faster. It's okay, Michel. You're beating a record. Dad... - What? - My feet hurt. I'm stopping. What? Why stopping? - I can't anymore. I'm exhausted. - What are you saying? Why stopping? No! He's not stopping, sir. It's just a bit of fatigue. What is this? Get back to that door! - I can't. - Go back to your door! - Back to your door! - Calm down, Roger. Back to your door! Is this how you thank me? Is this how you thank me? After all I've done for you? After what I paid? - Your coach, your shoes. And that's it? - Calm down, Roger. You're a piece of shit, Michel! - You're a piece of shit. - Roger! Easy! You shut up! It's the same to you, you have your money already. You don't care what we could have done with that car. For once I ask you for something! One time in my life! Only once! Mom... Look. Michel, do you hear me? It's Daddy. - About what time was it? - Seven o'clock. Seven, seven-fifteen. Around there. What an ordeal. It must be hard on you? Oh yes. Everything is lost. - The hailstones? - The famous hailstones. Hailstones. - Big ones? - They were huge. Like this. Sir, could you do that gesture again? So can I take a picture and have the size of the stone and field behind everything you've lost. Ready? - Don't move. - If you like, we have some hailstones in the freezer. I can bring them. - What? You kept them? - To show my children. - Well yes then. - Go get them, will you? - That's very kind. - Careful. Very good. Could you hold your hand towards me? A bit lower lower. There. Very good. Lend me your necklace. Take his hand. It's moving. He will wake up. I see the good life. I think your little girl is already in my belly - Your daughter is beautiful. - She'd better be. You know what a new wedding dress costs? 30 000. I can't afford 30 000. Certainly not for a hospital wedding. No way. - Where did you get it, then? - 3 000, rented. - Yeah? - Plus the dry cleaning. There's something I don't understand. On this contract they gave me... Look. Here. "Dry cleaning will be charged notwithstanding the state of the garment." What's a 'notwithstanding'? Well...it's notwithstanding. So must I pay or not? Say, Mommy. Patrick here has a 'notwithstanding'. That means he already paid, right? Sure, I'd say so. It means that your garment was charged. Okay. - Anyhow, she won't roll in mud. - Hope not. Get a move on! Miss Jocelyne Taminiaux, daughter of Patrick Taminiaux and Edith Colinet, residing at 7 Chemin du Halage, in Marchienne, Do you accept to take as spouse, here present, Mr. Michel Closset? Yes. Mr. Michel Closset, son of Roger Closset and Madeleine Lambotte, residing 30 Impasse Jaumet, La Docherie, Do you accept to take as spouse, here present, Jocelyne Taminiaux? Excuse me. Jocelyne and Michel, by the power vested in me, I now declare you united by bonds of marriage. Roger...Michel. It's no longer Michel. I got it changed. It's Mike Steven for the singing. - Pleased, Mr. Steven. - Likewise. - Can I see you a minute? - Excuse me. - What's going on? - Why? He doesn't look at all like Elvis. Forget the looks, it's the voice that counts, He has exactly the same vocal frequency as the King. - The same what? - Vocal frequency. American thing. Close your eyes, and you'll think Elvis is singing. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. He came from Gembloux. He'll sing for free, but you'll pay train fare. Give him two. Well then, shall we? So? Do I start? Go ahead, Mike. May I move closer? - Approach the child? - Yes, sure. There. If my wife finds out I brought the dog... - Know what you're doing? - You trust me or not? Not the point. You said the same for Johnny from Gembloux. I think that didn't work because Michel knew the King, but the King didn't know Michel. There was no exchange. Therefore, the stimulus wasn't... - The what?. - The stimulus? American thing. We didn't touch his deep feelings. No connection was made. But now, Sultan knows Michel. This time, an exchange will happen. - What should I do? - Let the dog loose. Here in the hospital? Are you crazy? Sultan. Come...close to Michel. Look, Sultan. Look at Michel's ball. Look. I swear it moved. I saw it on the screen. Only a little, it's true. But it's a start. It needs to start somewhere. In America they treat autistics with dolphin contact. Why wouldn't it work with dogs? It's true. Are you my friend? - Of course, Roger. - Can I ask a favour? Don't bring up Americans again. Can I talk a minute? Thank you. Nothing's changed here. Still your old stove. Remember when we had to move it? That was a backbreaker. It's silver. Look at the marks. A gift from my parents when I got married. Never been used, well, just once. For the boy's communion. Look closely, you'll see that... the fish knife... never was used. We had turkey that day. It's my son, Felix. I'm drowning. They want... They want to cut their machines off. I need money, Felix. It's my kid. So I thought... Since you know some... people at work, at the factory... Maybe you know someone who's interested. Pigeons doing well? Yes? That's good. What do you want me to do? Do you have a solution? Give him a big hug. Go get a towel. Okay, Louise. You can look. Happy birthday. You can blow them out. If you blow, you must make a wish. Lima 2 to Chief, over. I read you, Lima 2. Daddy, I made my wish. I just came from Marcinelle. A house fire, quite serious. Go ahead, what are you waiting for? Go ahead. Ruin your daughter's birthday. Well go on. - Are you crazy? - Go, what are you waiting for? Why? waiting? Did I say something? Did I say something? Did anyone hear me say I'd go? Did you hear that, Louise? Why are you picking a fight? What's your problem? Is this your problem? Is it this? Blow out your candles, Louise. What's with you? Why are you on my case? Was that necessary? That's all I said!! - It's your daughter's birthday! - Yes, couldn't it wait?! Is that what she wants? Cake? Here's some cake! Everyone has cake! Time to eat cake! Hello? Yes, speaking. He woke up! He woke up! Louise! Wait! Wait! Who wants champagne? That means it's good stuff. C'mon, Michel. Have a drop. Jocelyne, you're having a glass with us. Louise can even clink glasses with us. Good. It's not... It is not my habit to give speeches, but today I feel like trying it. I wanted to tell you... I know we've had times that were a burden, not easy, But we made it. This time we're there. I wanted to say I'm proud of you. Health! It's open. Come on in, Felix. Felix, you're having champagne with us. - Happy New Year, Felix. - Best wishes. Going okay? Beautiful, isn't it? Better than pigeons, eh? Go put your ear on it. Go put your ear on it. Go ahead, it won't bite. Jocelyne? Can he? Go on, get in there. He's wriggling, eh? Already feisty like his grandfather. You see, Felix... I think this child... Is a winner... He's got luck. You know why? Because, this little guy When he comes into the world, when he's born... He'll already be in it. The third millennium. Right there in it. You see? We had to fight to get here. But he'll open his big eyes and we'll bring it on a silver platter. He just needs to seize it. Do you think he'll thank us someday? Of course not. I don't know... Just press here. This button. Then you wind like this. Okay? Louise, stand in the right place! Smile! Ready? - Hold on. okay, go ahead. - Ready? Take another. This is historic. - I wind it here? - Yes, the grey lever. Are we celebrating? Party time? - Long live the year 2000! - Happy New Year, everyone! Let's dance! Subtitling: eunoia KG (Bedankt for Dutch subs!)
