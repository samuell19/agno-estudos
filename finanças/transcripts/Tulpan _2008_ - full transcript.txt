There's also a sea horse. It's so small. With a head like a horse, but a body like a camel. It swims like a twig, very slowly. It swims like a twig, and eats only teeny tiny things. These things arejust like flies are to us. When a tiny being appears, it eats it right away. Ever seen a shark? Never. But I've seen worse: an octopus. It's a big hunk ofmeat. And slimy, like a brain. Not one bone. Long tentacles like hoses. Like human arms, but longer. And on each one there's a suction cup. It grabs a person and draws him in. Then you've got to bite it between the eyes. Ifyou're off byjust a hair, it's over. You're dinner. Ifyou bite that spot, the tentacles go limp. But ifyou miss the right spot, it squeezes you and sucks blood out through your mouth. It gobbles you right up. It gets you for good. Happened once when... -Enough.

I swim down and pull him to the surface. Something grabs my legs and starts to squeeze. I feel something pulling me underwater, tentacles squeezing me. My bones are already cracking.
