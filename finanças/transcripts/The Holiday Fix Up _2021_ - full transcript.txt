Okay, Suarez family, are you ready to see your new living room? Follow me. by refinishing this beautiful fireplace, I was able to bring this entire space to life, and with Christmas coming up, I added some festive touches. This stocking holder from our sponsor, the home shop, is one of my favorites. Also, to keep your new space clean, we are gifting you the shark vacmop. It's a vacuum and a mop. So tell us, what do you think? Cut! Let's go. We're behind schedule. Take that, please. We didn't even get to see what they thought. You know that's my favorite part. We can film them giving a reaction later. We'll edit it in in post. I didn't even get to give them a hug. We can fix that in post, too. Now, let's go. We are behind schedule. so I added an electric griddle and then my favorite copper sink. How do you like it? Cut! and I added this beautiful tub for you. So how do you like it? Cut! the cover turned out great! Sam, you okay? Power nap. okay, I'm back. What's up next? Oh, we need to discuss a theme for the live Christmas special. I was thinking a Santa's workshop angle. Uh, about that... Uh, the network has decided to give the live special to Hailey. what? Hailey? Yeah. But I was gonna add 10 more homes to feature on the special. No host has ever renovated 50 homes in a single year. Josh, no one works harder than me, and especially Hailey? Now, look, you're killing it. But Hailey's a new face. The network wants to see how she'll handle it. Her social media's through the roof. Millions of followers. I know, I know. Okay, I'm gonna get my numbers up. I'm gonna start posting more. It's about opening up, recapturing some of that Sam magic that everyone loved in those online videos that you started with. All you ever share now is work. People want to see more of your personal side. You know, what do you do when you're relaxing at home? I'm sorry. My personal side? Yeah, all in between shooting 40 episodes a year. Look, my home is my suitcase. Then this is the perfect time to start. Your show's done till next year. You're off the hook for the special, and it's Christmas, so what better time to just slow down and enjoy? Slow down. Yeah. Wait, are you gonna go and visit your mom down in Florida for Christmas? That would be nice to share ... the two of you hanging out, celebrating the holidays. Just document everything. Use a good filter, natural light when you can. No, she thought I'd be working, so she's on a Christmas cruise with her fiancé. Oh. Okay. Uh, what if I, um ... what if I do something personal here, like a tree trimming tutorial at my place with, uh, the Christmas swag from the home shop? Go more personal. A tree-trimming party at my place? Getting better. With my one friend/producer? I was thinking more an actual party with actual friends. Yeah. No, no, no, I can totally make it look like that. I will give some tips, post a ton of pictures amp up the decor. How's tomorrow? I am ... great. Okay. I'll see you then. Uh, Sam. okay. boy, this thing has some suck. hmm. Hey, Jack, I was just about to call you. I just have the news about the inn. Are you okay? Uh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Nobody got hurt, thank goodness. Just got a big old tree in the middle of the inn now, though. Ugh. I'm so sorry. How are you? I'm missing Rita every day. Did you see that, uh, episode that I dedicated to her? The one where I renovated that couple's cabin for Christmas? Yeah, I watched it last week. Rita would have loved it. You know, Christmas was always her favorite. Well, she was the queen of it, always decorating the inn and throwing those amazing harborfests. Hey, you were doing it right alongside her most of the time. wait a minute. Are you gonna be able to throw the harborfest? Christmas is less than two weeks away. Well, actually, that's what I'm calling. I'm in need of a little Christmas miracle. from me? I-I don't know how much Christmas magic I have in me these days. The inn is shut down until we repair the damage. Uh, I'm gonna have to cancel the harborfest for the first Christmas since Rita started it. What? Jack. Well, unless, uh ... unless maybe you come back home for Christmas. Come back to bell harbor? Yeah, you could help me get the inn renovated, decorated for the harborfest and... And, hey, you're the only person I know who can actually pull this off. Jack, you know ... you know I would love to help, but I mean, I-I... I-I can't. That's okay. No, I-it's okay. I knew it was a long shot. Uh... I bet you have ... have that Christmas special you have to film every year, huh? Okay, even if I could help, there's no way that I could get a crew with this sort of notice. Well, I have a crew and a place for you to stay. I just need the person with the design expertise. Are you in? I'm in. hey, coop. Oh, hey, Mary. Thanks for picking up my trees. Any time, guys. Seriously? Sorry. I'm trying to be a good little sister. It's fine. You don't have to hide it. Sam and I dated a long time ago. I can look at this. see? Right. Come on. It's not like you don't have other pictures of her in here. And I don't like to hold on to the past. please. You own a reclaimed woodshop. You're obsessed with the past. That's where you're gonna put it? You just said it wasn't a problem. It's not. Just distracts from the menus is all. If that's where you want it, fine by me. And you're sure about that? Yes. Sam and I have both moved on. If she was here right now, I would tell her the same thing. I'm very busy and happy in my own life. I don't even think about her, except for when I see her pictures here every day. Tell her yourself. sounds like you're saying you think about me every day. Sam! Hey! I couldn't believe it when I got your text last night. Her what? Let me get you a cup of coffee. You must be exhausted. hey, coop. Sam. What are you doing here? Oh, you know, just taking a Christmas break from my own very busy and happy life. So you're back to the holidays, huh? That's great. It's been a long time. Made you a slice of gingerbread loaf, too. I know you love it. oh, uh, do you have ... two sugars, none of the fake crap. Thanks. Some things never change. And some things do. oh, so good! Mmm. It's like Christmas in a cake. There's more where that came from. I have some streusel cinnamon rolls I'm baking now. I'll bring some by later. Oh, and my peppermint bark. you are spoiling me, Jen. I'm just so happy to have you home, especially during the holidays. I mean, you haven't been home for Christmas since... Since we broke up. Since she left to do the show. They're both true. Take your pick. I'm gonna get going. Give my love to rob, okay? Oh, I will. He'll be so happy to see you back. See you later. Good to see you. Hey, Sam. Maybe we could, um, you know, grab a bite, catch up? Oh, I'm, uh ... I'm actually gonna be really busy while I'm here, so... Yeah, me too. I just got a huge job ahead of me this week. Well, then, sounds like we both have a lot on our plate. I'm glad to hear you're happy, coop. hi. Sam! You're home. Hey, john. Hey, how does this look? A little bit this way. Right here? Perfect. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. samwich. Oh, there you are. It's been too long since I've seen you. Ah! And too long since someone's called me that. it feels weird to be here without Rita. To you and me both, kiddo. I'm really sorry I didn't make it to the funeral. I was shooting, and by the time I was able to get a plane, I just ... I couldn't make it in time. Well, you're here now to save the harborfest for Christmas, and trust me, Rita would have cared a lot more about that. And so do I. Well, I'm gonna do my best to make her proud. You always have. Come on, let's take a look, shall we? this looks exactly as I remember it. Ah. We'd, uh, already started decorating for Christmas before the storm came in. It looks good. Oh. Hmm. I remember these pillows. Rita and I got them from that antique Christmas market one year. uh, luckily, this part of the inn didn't get damaged, but then there is, uh, this part of the inn. Where the work starts. Wow. Jack, I had no idea it was this bad. I'm so sorry, well, is ... is it too much? I know we only have 10 days. look, if it's more to take on than you thought ... no, no, this is ... this is what I do. I'll make it work. Don't worry. Well, I don't know how to thank you. Oh, come on. You and Rita always taught us that when it comes to Christmas, it's better to give than receive. Well, that was back when you were a kid coming to the harborfest yourself. You and Rita always gave us the best Christmas presents. Oh. Those were from Santa. We just handed them out. well, now it's my turn to give you a gift, and I'm not gonna let you down. all right, we're gonna need to clear out the furniture and the debris. You mentioned a local crew to help out? Yeah, it's more of a one-man operation. oh, well, here he is now. Sam, meet your crew. You remember coop. Wait. What? Uh, and coop, Sam is here to fix the inn and save the harborfest. Oh, now, I didn't even think about, uh... Are ... are you guys okay working together? Yeah, I'm ... I'm fine with it. I mean, of course, if coop is. Oh, I'm more than fine with it. I'm ... I'm thrilled, actually. I'm ecstatic. I'm ... overjoyed, yes. Sam, I will, uh, show you where you're staying. it's a pretty small suitcase. Well, I'm not gonna be here for long, just till after Christmas. That's how you do things now, right? Hmm? Quick and move on fast? Move on fast? funny, I thought that's what you did to me. Uh, you guys good? Yeah. Yeah. here it is. Oh, coop. This is great. Jenny's gonna love it. Thank you. Well, it's all you, man. You make my sister happy, which makes my life happy. So, um... I heard that you and Sam are renovating the inn together. That's got to be interesting. Interesting. that's one word for it. So you're doing the whole harborfest together? How's that gonna work? I have no idea. It is not a big deal. We're both totally fine with it. Oh, come on, you guys were high school sweethearts. I mean, it's got to be a little awkward. Yeah, it's in the past, rob. You know that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Jenny told me. She said you guys are happy and fine and busy, and if you, uh, keep telling yourself that enough times, maybe you'll actually start believing it. I do believe it. I still can't believe this is where we ended up. You know? I mean, five years ago, we were together doing those diy videos at the inn. I still watch those online whenever I decorate for Christmas. Like that one where you turned those rusted galvanized tins into tree stands. We had gold spray paint in our hair for days. when the home network called us about doing a show together, we were so excited. I mean, it was our dream come true. You did a 180. You didn't do the show. You didn't leave town. You broke up. would have been more awkward if we broke up and I still did the show. And then he just made me do it alone. After all that time we spent talking about doing it together. Well, maybe it's a good thing you guys are working together again. Might be nice to finally talk about what happened. No, no, nope. There is no need to rehash that. I'm here for two weeks, and then I'm gone. So we just need to keep it professional, quick, and easy. Look, even if it's not easy, I'm not gonna let that stop me. Sam and I owe that much to Jack. Okay. Then I guess you got everything under control, then. Definitely. Definitely. Oh, I've got it totally under control. ah, thanks for today, jenny. Of course. Oh, don't forget ... the cider mill's having their annual tasting tomorrow. ah, the good old cider tasting. You want to go together? It'll be like old times. Just like old times. Sure. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, hon. "get personal." right. Okay. Let's give this a try. Okay. Happy, happy, happy. Christmastime. that's it. Hey, everyone, so with Christmas coming up, I'm feeling pretty nostalgic. Have you ever actually been home and still felt homesick? Ugh. That was terrible. Delete. coffee. What are you doing here? Jack didn't tell you? I'm staying here, too. ugh. okay, so I came up with an overall plan last night. I'm still working on the drawings, but I just want to kind of walk through the space with you to give you an idea of what I'm thinking. So the first thing we do is we're gonna tear down this wall. Tear down? Why not patch it up? Well, because an open concept will add more light to the space. And if we do this, we can create a bigger great room and we can add a window array that looks out to the water. We're gonna save the studs, though. They're true dimensional. Are you a secret hoarder? With the harborfest taking place here, it'll give us more room, and then we can see the Christmas tree from every part of it. Oh, that would be quite the view. Beautiful. Thanks. Let's see. We need new furniture. I can get a deal through the home shop if I give them some plugs. Their stuff is all the same ... no personality, no history. Rita picked every single piece of furniture in this inn. I know. I remember. But a big-box store's a really good starting point. It looks nice. And remember, people are coming here for Christmas, so it needs to look professionally done. Remember, people are coming here for Christmas, so it needs to feel like home. I design 40 houses a year. I think I know how to make a place feel like a home. what? I just forgot how opinionated you are. Huh. Well, I forgot how stubborn you are. oh, look, there's a scratch on the table. Should we chuck it? I think there's some napkin a guest sneezed in and left behind four years ago. Should we save it? look, what I do want to make sure we use for the harborfest is Rita's Christmas china, like she always did. No new plates from the home shop? remember when, uh, Rita and Jack used to tell us that the china had Christmas magic in it? Of course it did. what? Oh, no. When the tree hit the house, it shook the whole thing to the core. These were vintage. Even if we tried, we could never replace these. Well, you're not gonna get rid of them. What do you want to do? Glue them back together? I mean, even if you tried, it would never be the same. So, what? When something's broken, you're just done with it forever? Pretty much. Some things can't be fixed. Ah, I forgot how cute this is. Do they still do the Santa sing off, too? Yep. You and coop used to do a pretty mean duet, if I recall. Hmm. How's it going with you two at the inn? Great, other than the fact that we can barely be in the same room without driving each other crazy. Oh, that good, huh? Yeah, it's gonna be nice to get a little break from ... hey, gar. Coop. Sam. I didn't know you were coming with jenny. Uh, actually, I'm ... I'm getting pretty tired, so I think I'm gonna go. No, no, no. Uh, rob and I are ... are heading out. Here you go, buddy. Okay, this is silly. We're working together. We're both adults. That's debatable. There's no reason we both can't stay and have a good time. Sure. So glad you're back, Sam. And then coop decided we had to win the snowball fight. Me? You were out for blood. You were pummeling everyone like it was some kind of Christmas Olympics. Yeah, I think I still got the bruises. I'm sorry, but it does lead me to my point that coop and I are the only undefeated bell harbor snowball throwdown champions. Very true. Well, we're gonna have to challenge that, because rob and I are now the longest-running champions. -Boop. -Boop. Oh, speaking of champions, should we get going? Oh, yeah, I have to prep everything for the Christmas pie bake-off tomorrow. You better be there. Of course. You got it in the bag. All right, so I'll come with you, then. No! Stay. I insist. See you, buddy. everyone is counting on us, so let's make sure we get back on our timeline today. I agree. And I think that is all I need for out front. Yeah. Okay. I was looking at your plans last night. I got an idea for the mantel. I think that if I use the wood from ... no. We don't have enough time. I mean, I'm sure it would look great, but let's just keep it as simple as possible. Since when do we keep the harborfest simple? Since we have less than two weeks to do it in. Look, I've got a plan in order, and I think it's gonna look great. I'm just the crew. Got it. I'll just pay for this and load it up. I didn't mean it that way. I gotta take this. Hey, josh. Miss me already? I do miss you since I haven't seen you post a single video. Yeah, I know, I know. I will, uh ... I will post something, and I promise I will make it very personal for you. I think you're really gonna love it, babe. "babe"? Is that a thing we're doing now? It's very Hollywood, but I can roll with that. Let me know if you like it, babe. All right. See you later, babe. Yeah. ah. hey, everyone, so I'm here in bell harbor, where I grew up, and, uh, this inn is very special to me, so I'm excited to get it fixed up for the harborfest that we do here every year for Christmas. What's that voice you use? what do you mean? It's my voice. Yeah, but it changes when you film. It's kind of like a host voice. well, I am a host. Gotta film those things the whole time? No. so the first project that we're tackling is we are demoing this wall, uh, to make an even bigger great room, so stay tuned and I'll show you how it turns out. Okay, so, um, we need to replace this header beam because it's load-bearing, so once this wall is down, let's keep 10 inches on each side. There it is. There's your real voice. Thanks for the feedback. I'll check back in when you're done. Seriously? If you're going to do this, you gotta really do it, not just for the camera. What does that mean? It means, since when do you not do your own demo? okay, so with demo, you want to make sure that you put all your force into it. and for some reason, this is feeling very cathartic. It's a great way to get out the holiday stress, especially when the people around you are driving you a little nuts. hey. Oh, hey, Jack. So how's everything going at the inn? I mean, everything working out okay? We're finding our way, or her way. Ah. Rita used to say that Sam was like a gingerbread cookie ... sweet, but with a little bit of a kick, but the kick is the best part. Feels like a kick below the belt right now. Ah. Well, then I have one more piece of advice. Lay it on me. When in doubt, there's nothing a slice of pie can't make better. Pie bake-off. Pie bake-off. It's tonight. Yeah. Thanks, Jack. Yeah. Hey, I-I was gonna go with Sam tonight, but I feel a little tired. Uh... Could you do me a favor? Walk over with her? Sure. Great. is that the crate from the tree farm? Yeah. I thought it'd be nice to dress up the rooms a little bit more. Wrapped in a Sam-fixed bow. Minutes after you demolish a wall. Consider me impressed. well, it's been nice to be able to find things again that inspire me. You don't get to do that on your show? No, not really. Things just usually get sent over through production, so... Creating something out of nothing ... it's always been your superpower. Uh, Jack said we should just head over without him. To the pie bake-off. Ugh. I forgot about that. You know what, I think, uh, we've got a lot of work to do tomorrow, so I think I'm just gonna finish these and then get to bed early, so... what? You said you haven't celebrated a real Christmas in years. How are you gonna throw the harborfest if you don't get in the spirit a little? Well, how are we gonna throw it if the inn isn't ready? The Sam I used to know liked to have fun. Well, the Sam I know takes her work very seriously. Okay, a few more pieces of gingersnap apple pie for me, then. Well, maybe you could, uh, bring one home. Sorry. Against the rules. Okay, okay, but this is just so I can support jenny. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go... Fix my hair. I'll wait. Okay. okay, let me give you the lay of the land. There's still a few main contenders. Ah, okay, well, I obviously know a few. There's jenny, Phil. Mandy Jenkins, wait. The lunch lady Mandy Jenkins? She ended up going to culinary school. Oh. And she makes a mean eggnog pie. Excuse me! Do I hear my own flesh and blood talking up the competition? Never. No. Okay. All right, guys. My hot cocoa pie with marshmallow topping and peppermint crumble ... ooh! ... Will make even the coldest Grinch heart burst into tinsel! okay, bye. We're not giving any hints as to who made it because it's a non-biased taste test, but, um... Got it. ah! This looks too pretty to eat. Oh. Really? You're one of those people who post pictures of food? I'm trying to show more of my personal side on social media, if you must know. My, uh, producer josh has been on my case about it. Ah, your producer josh wants you to share more of your personal side. That's what I said. So you want to share more of your personal side on social media, and I think that's how you do it? You're right. I can do better. It wasn't a challenge. oh, it sounded like one. You want to join me? No. Hey, everyone, so I'm at the bell harbor Christmas pie bake-off with the world's best hot cocoa pie and... A mystery man who refuses to show his face. Let me guess ... you're not on, uh, social media at all. No. Does that mean you've tried to look me up? I might have. Once or twice. You know, I didn't know that someone could actually be unsearchable. you don't even have a site for your business. Well, word of mouth suits me just fine. Hmm. So does that mean that you've never looked me up, either? I may have. Once or twice. But to be honest, jenny's better than any search engine. Really? Well, what have you heard? Well, you're on your fourth year of your show on the home network. Your mom's getting married this summer, and... You're dating a realtor who, um ... who also has a show on the network. Wow. jenny sounds more like a, uh, entertainment correspondent. But, uh, yeah, she got ... she got most of it right. You're, uh ... you're not with the guy anymore? No, we, uh ... we ended things a while ago. Honestly, we both worked and traveled so much, so we barely saw each other. It wasn't ... who wants more pie?! -Me. -Yes, me too. Bye. okay. Oh, hey, don't forget to take a picture. good call. Mm. Not bad. no, you're not ... you're posting that. Give me the phone. I need the hits, though. Give me that phone. Give me that phone. And the winner is... Jenny! yeah, jenny! anyways, I should, um... I really should get going. Let me walk you back. No! I mean... Stay. Enjoy. ooh! Yeah! congrats, sis. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Where's Sam? Oh, she, um ... she had to head out. have you thought about telling you the truth of why you called things off? It's in the past, jenny. But maybe it shouldn't be. I mean, if you don't do it before Christmas, I don't know if you're ever gonna get another chance. so from the comments on the video yesterday, it seems like you all want to see more of this Christmas Reno and that pie recipe. I can't help you with that. I'm actually a terrible baker. I leave that to my friend jenny, who owns this shop, muddy waters, here in bell harbor. But what I can show you is a preview of the inn. Our framing materials are coming in later today, and a very busy day ahead of us, so stay tuned. So you really are gonna be doing that the whole time, huh? I wouldn't expect a guy who's so far off the map and has a flip phone to understand. But, yes, you got over 1,000 likes on the clip I shared yesterday, which means what? That means that more people are hearing about Christmas in bell harbor. And I forgot. It's kind of fun to share this diy stuff. And the comments ... they've been... They've been really sweet. Here. Look at that one. Hmm. "I've been meaning to tackle a demo project this Christmas. You make it look easy." okay. "the inn looks like it's gonna be so cute." aw, that's nice. oh, "there's gonna be no snow this Christmas because the chemistry between you two is so hot." okay. You get the gist. Yeah. Hey, I know you have your own plan, but, um, I found this in the storage closet and thought it could help. Rita's sketchbook. ♪ this time we all know that our love will always flow ♪ ♪ to the ones that we hold so dear ♪ oh, wow. I think this was one of the designs for the first harborfest. Oh, I remember that. That's when Rita wanted to do a whole Christmas candy area in the front. right, and you came up with the idea to give the table candy-cane legs. yeah. oh, wow. That is so pretty. An arbor right by the Christmas tree. Perfect spot for a Christmas wedding. Actually, that'd be a really good spot to post pictures from. Or sit and enjoy with no technology at all. How'd it turn out? What? The arbor, when you made it? I don't know what this is from. We never did it. Yeah, I, uh ... I've never seen it before. Coop and Sam! I heard you two were back together again. Ah, we always knew it would happen. oh, no. We're, um... We're just working together. Strictly professional. Yeah, sure. That's what I said. Merry Christmas, guys. Okay, merry Christmas. Wow. oh. Perfect. It looks like our framing materials should be pulling up any minute. Let's get a move on. Okay. This is what we're using? Yes, that's why there's five pallets of it here. why? Because... It's not good quality. I mean, I know it's not 100-year-old reclaimed oak, but I think it's fine. Plus, it was all I was able to get on such short notice. Well, maybe if you asked your crew for a local hookup, you would have had more choices, but that would have meant you actually taking my opinion. Please don't be like that. Look, we have eight days here. I'm just trying to get this job done. How? This is still builder's grade, okay? So next time we need new materials, I'll ask you. But for now, let's just keep going. I think it looks good. So as long as it looks good on the outside, it doesn't matter what the real story is. Come on, Sam, this place means something to me. I care about this place, too. I'm not using it. Fine, then I'll just do it myself. Fine. Pretty sure that's what you wanted to do anyway. Great. Great. Sam! Grab a seat. Ah! Everything going okay? Uh, yeah. You need a hand? What, do you have time? I thought you said you were knocking the wall down this afternoon. Coop's, uh... Taking a little break. Ah. Hey, did Rita ever talk to you about building an arbor? I saw it in her sketchbook. Oh, yeah, that was an idea of hers once, but we ... we didn't end up doing it. you two managed to collect so many of these. yeah, for once, these weren't Rita's antiquing. Years ago, right when we were learning the history of the inn and thinking of starting the harborfest, Rita befriended a tinsmith. A tinsmith? A tinsmith. That kind of sounds like her. Oh, yeah. The only one still working in all of new England, ah? Well, he was so, uh, charmed by her, of course, and the history of harborfest, he made dozens for us. Yeah, we've had these for years, through all of our Christmases together. And even now, they're bringing me comfort, even on my first Christmas without her. Well, Rita always said that the most valuable things had a good story behind them. is everything okay? Yeah, it will be... I hope. I have to go. Yeah. you still sulk in the same spot. remember when we were younger, we used to sneak in here? And whenever there was a storm, we'd bring in pillows and blankets and just watch it for hours. Yeah. Spent a lot of late nights here. we always got the master key somehow. Wasn't a master key. I used to pick the lock. of course you did. What happened to the old fence? The one with our initials in it? They tore it down. Why would they do that? It was rotting. I'm surprised it bothers you. Okay, enough. Look, we might not agree on everything, but I know that we want to make the harborfest and Christmas amazing for Jack. Yeah, but I don't want it just to look amazing. I want it to be amazing, even when a camera's not rolling. This place matters to both of us, a lot. I owe everything to Jack and Rita, so if you say those materials aren't good enough, then I trust you. You do. Yes. We've always worked well as a team, so let's actually start being a team. That means no walking away. No shortcuts. And we're gonna tell a story, like Rita always did. We'll make this even better than any other harborfest for Jack. Deal? Deal. I found a bunch of Rita's old clippings for inspo. We definitely have to go classic Christmas with the decor. She went all out. Oh, and I talked to Jack about a tinsmith. I was gonna ask him if maybe he could make some mugs to go with the cider. And then that idea you had for the mantel. Think you still have time? I think so. But don't you want to go simple? Nah. It's Christmas. Let's make some magic. ah. All right. now you do it. Here we go. all right. nice. Looks good. So we're gonna start installing the vinyl windows tomorrow, but first, I wanted to share us picking out the Christmas tree for the harborfest. Let's be honest. You're doing the picking. I'm just the muscle around here. Ah. okay. nice. Merry Christmas. Hey, hey! Ah! Ho, ho, ho! ugh. Yes, Ryan.

Hashtag Sam fix. Okay, I'll call you back. When? So the key to a good wreath is this threading technique that I'm gonna show you. It's super simple. So... All right. Oh, funny. what?

Perfect. oh! coop... Yeah? We can't. I wasn't. okay, good, because... We just need to keep it professional. Okay. hmm. Are we interrupting something? Oh, just us decking the halls. What's, uh ... what's going on? Are we picking you guys up tomorrow morning or what? What's ... what's tomorrow morning? The snowball throwdown. Yeah. Wait, wait. How is there a snowball throwdown when there's barely been any snow this winter? -The snow man! -The snow man! Nick has a snow machine. So no making excuses, Sam. I don't know. We got a lot of work to do. The harborfest is in a few days. Mnh-mnh. I told you. They're too scared. They're not gonna make it. I guess the crown is ours for another year, rob. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Hey, coop. How are you going to throw the harborfest without getting into the spirit and throwing a snowball at rob's face? -Hey! -Unh-unh. Okay. We'll be there. -Oh, we are also in. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah, we are. hmm. Welcome... Happy holidays. ...To the bell harbor snowball throwdown. Yes! Whoo! Oh, and thanks to nick "the snow man" Bradley... ...For helping make it happen. As last year's champ, we're gonna go over the rules one more time. We work in teams of two. If you or your partner get hit, you are out. Last two standing win. All right, guys, let's go, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move, let's move! -green. -Yes! Same strategy as the old days?

Good job, buddy. sorry. I gotta get this. Sam, you're giving us gold, babe! What do you mean? Oh, and I, um, think I'm over the "babe" thing. Oh, thank god, because that was, like, just so weird to me. Anyway, have you seen how many new followers you have? People love the videos you've been posting! Everyone's making wreaths like you did. Oh, that's great. I'm glad we're inspiring people for Christmas. And you are showing so much more of your personal side. I-I told you people would respond to that. Yeah, I-I guess I am. I haven't honestly been thinking about that much lately. We've just been having fun and shooting what we've been up to, everyone getting in the holiday spirit. Well, it is working, and ... and everyone is shipping you and coop, whatever that means. I-I'm just gonna assume that it's good. No, I am being serious. Someone even started a fan account for coop's arms. His arms? Apparently, they are very muscular, in case you haven't noticed. I mean, I-I might have noticed. And, uh, the hashtag "I want soop for Christmas" is trending. Soup? Who eats soup for Christmas? No, "soop." s-o-o-p. It is you and coop's celebrity couple name. Well, there's gonna be a lot of disappointed people come Christmas 'cause coop and I are just ... we're just ... we're working together. Oh, Sam, come on. Seriously? It is hard to fake chemistry like that. Okay. Do we have chemistry? Yes, we always have. But, look, when we ended, I just... Yeah, I-I can't let myself go back there. And honestly, I don't even know if he would want to, either. Okay, fine. Just keep your eye on the prize. I am talking to the network about those 10 extra homes for you to renovate. Everyone is very, very, very excited. Now, when do you get back? The day after Christmas. Okay, I'll see you then, babe. Sam. Okay, bye. ooh. Nope. oh, wow. You finished. Almost. Just have to soften a few edges. It's gorgeous and tells a story. This is all the wood you salvaged from the tree? Told you it was worth saving. Something special about holding onto something from your past, not given up on them, figuring out a way to make it work. You didn't that with me. it wasn't exactly like that. You hold onto everything, coop ... every rusted nail, every last bit of wood. And with us, you just... You just gave up, and I still don't know why. Sam ... you know what? Actually, sorry. We don't ... we don't need to go down that road. You sure? 'cause we can definitely go down this road. No, no, no, it's, um... It's all in the past. There's no need to bring it back up. Because what we should be focusing on is the harborfest. We only have three days left, and there's still a lot we need to fill in, so... Yeah. You, uh ... you ended up saving, uh, the broken Christmas china of Rita's, right? Of course I did. Guess you won't be calling me a hoarder anymore, will you? no, no. I still will. still sketching in the same spot. feels nice to have time and freedom to just... Think and design. Ah. All the Christmas decorating I've done since I left here has been for the show. It's been great, and it's all looked really beautiful, but I don't always get the chance to connect to the people I'm doing it for, you know, to uncover their stories. There's something special about this. It's the Christmas magic of bell harbor. always was your favorite holiday. Mm. It hasn't been for a while. But I'm starting to remember what I love about it again. Can you really build that? Uh-huh. Can you actually make this? Rita's arbor. But with adding a lighting element to it to bring it to life. So here's what I was thinking. It'll tell a story, and it'll honor Rita and Jack all at the same time, with our own little twist on it. Do you think you have time to build it? I think so. We could get started now, if you want to give me a hand. I'd love that. I'm really glad you're back, Sam. Yeah, me too. Feels nice to be somewhere that feels like home. It is your home. Always will be. so, you ready? Ready for...? Um, gotta get to the woodshop, you know? Time is not on our side. Right. Of course. Please, lead the way. oh, wow. This place is amazing. You bring all your dates here? Only the ones that wear protective goggles. so this is a date, huh? I did not say that. Well, yeah, you just did. you make these? You could make a fortune selling them online. I do okay selling them right here. ♪ you're the letter never sent ♪ hmm. We should put this out at the inn for Christmas. It's like Rita always said ... connecting, bringing people back in time. Speaking of time, we should get started. Hold on, hold on. It's not a fancy power tool from the home shop. you can just take an angle. Okay? And go nice and smooth. ♪ I've spent one too many Christmas nights without you ♪ ♪ too many new year's days wondering about you ♪ ♪ if I could make just one wish before tonight passes ♪ ♪ then I wish Christmas would give us ♪ ♪ second chances ♪ I think I can finish this up tomorrow. We'll wait till the harborfest to place it. Perfect. Oh. This is stunning. What are you gonna use it for? Well, I'm not sure. Sometimes it's just a matter of holding on to a piece till you find the perfect place for it. Hmm. Oh, wow. This is great. ♪ I've spent one too many Christmas nights without you ♪ ♪ too many new year's days wondering about you ♪ you saved this? ♪ if I could make just one wish before tonight ends ♪ think I could let them throw that away? But ... you said I gave up on us. That's not true. I never stopped thinking about you, Sam. About us. ♪ if it's a heart that makes a house ♪ ♪ not the walls or the wood ♪ ♪ wherever you are is my home ♪ ♪ wouldn't change it if I could ♪ ♪ I spent one too many Christmas night without you ♪ two sugars, none of the fake crap, and almond milk. Thank you. So we going to pretend like last night didn't happen, or we gonna pretend like I'm not leaving after Christmas? I'm strongly leaning towards the second option. good morning. Hey, Jack. Ah! I got the gifts for the harborfest tomorrow. Perfect. The kids are gonna love them. Wow, look at that. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. No peeking. What? We want to show you it all at once. Oh! We'll give you a tour before it all starts. Well, are you sure you don't need any help? We've got it covered. We've got some friends helping out, and coop, you were just about to ... do the electrical for the lights, and you're gonna do the ... finish the ornaments. Great. it has been so wonderful having you home. Mm. I'm gonna miss you, samwich. We, um, all will. Hmm. Me too. Yeah, you guys are a good team. Always have been. Okay, shoo. Time to go. See you tomorrow, I will shoo. Tell bill hi. okay, bud, you keep working. Yeah. All right. Can you get me like 12 of those? Thank you. Ah! And how is my absolute favorite star? I didn't think my Christmas gift to you was that good. Well, the network just called, and they're loving the content you have shared this week. And with your numbers so high, they're thinking maybe they made a bit of a mistake. A mistake? They want you back by Christmas morning. Uh, I mean, why me. I mean, numbers ... your numbers are higher. They want you back in time to shoot the live portion of the special, a walkthrough of the 10 houses. You got your 50 renos, Sam, more than any other host ever. They're gonna fly you home tomorrow night. O-on Christmas eve? Oh, oh, and get this. They're gonna roll straight into shooting the next season of "the Sam fix" with international renovations. Oh, my god. Can you even believe this? Oh, please let one of them be Italy. I mean, amalfi, positano. Maybe Pisa. No, not Pisa, but still. Ah! Look at you. You're speechless. Well done, Sam. I told you if you went home, you would get those social media numbers up, didn't I? You can thank me later. I gotta go. Coop. Did you just hang up on me? Hey. Coop. You want to film this, too? Get those numbers up even more? Coop, that's not why I did this. I came home for Jack, to make sure we gave him an amazing Christmas. Look, everything we filmed ... I didn't know people would like it so much. It was just us having fun. I hope you can believe me on that. The fact is, you're still leaving tomorrow. We always knew I was gonna have to leave at some point. Look, I-I can't just walk away from everything I've built over the last few years. I wasn't asking you to. I would never ask you to. But bell harbor's my home. And you're never going to leave. I know. And you're never gonna stay. This is the first Christmas you've been back for in years. Why do you think I don't come back to bell harbor for Christmas? 'cause you're busy. I have been, but there's a reason it's been so easy for me to say yes to host those specials. It meant having an excuse not to come back to the place where my heart broke. When you told me on Christmas eve that you weren't leaving with me, do you think I just brushed that off? Sam ... we could have done the show together. We could have been together this whole time, but you chose to walk away from all of that. It wasn't easy for me, either. You could have stayed. you didn't give me much of a choice. If you didn't want to do the show, you could have told me a lot earlier instead of just quitting on me last second. Like, that wasn't you really breaking up with me? It wasn't like that. Then what was it like? Because I still don't understand. it was never gonna be our show. What do you mean? When the network came to bell harbor, it was because they saw our videos of us fixing up the rooms at the inn and decorating for Christmas. Yeah, they talked a big game. They got us excited. And then right before I was gonna meet you here on Christmas eve, the network came to me. They told me they were only interested in you. Why didn't you tell me? I had plans for us, but I was trying to do the right thing. By lying to me. By not forcing you into a bad choice. I knew how much you wanted that show. I didn't want to make you decide between me and your dream. So you decided for me, is that it? You didn't even give me a chance to fight for us or to try to make it work. You didn't give me a choice in any of this. I was protecting you. Or maybe you were protecting yourself. Sam. wow. I can't believe you pulled it off. No. We did. Jack's here. Jack. You ready for your tour? Ah, like a kid on Christmas morning. people have been coming to spend their Christmas eve here together for years. We knew it needed to feel like home. Like a place where you could disconnect from the regular world and celebrate each other. And we added a few new Christmas treasures of our own. we wanted this to be the next chapter in your story. Another piece woven into its history. The original mantel got pretty banged up, so... We created a new one using the wood reclaimed from the tree. Oh. It's just beautiful. Like coop always says, sometimes it's worth it to hold onto something and make it work. And sometimes you have to let go of something you love. If it's the right thing to do. Mm. So that's why I listened to Sam when she said we gotta to get rid of this wall. let's go see the rest of it. ♪ fa la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ Santa! ♪ 'tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ fa la la, la la la, la la la ♪ oh, my god. we wanted to tell a story, like Rita always did. and what better story this year than of old and new traditions merging together? Ahhhh! With a little Christmas magic. hey! were you in on this? Huh? Aw. thank you. Ah. -Thank you. -Thanks for your help. Oh! Well, you've outdone yourselves. Rita would have been blown away. well, speaking of Rita... is that... Rita's Christmas china. It always welcomed everyone during the holidays, and now it always will. ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ oh. We found the design in Rita's sketchbook, and we added our own little twist to it. It's constructed with the wood from the fallen tree. Over 100 years of history in this. Well, Rita always said the most valuable things had a story behind them. And... and what a story it was. uh, you know, when, uh, Rita and I moved in here, it was just a building ... four walls, roof. It's the love, the memories, the people you share it with that made it a home. thank you for this. Merry Christmas, Jack. merry Christmas. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me it's time. Please don't make me say goodbye. Merry Christmas, samwich. And thanks for being my Christmas miracle. Um... Okay, maybe it's not my place, but I can't let you leave without knowing the truth. Coop was not planning to quit on you that Christmas eve. I know. He was originally planning to propose. Propose? Right there by the tree. He had a ring. Uh... We've held on to it for him all these years. It broke his heart to even look at it. That arbor was actually Rita's design... ...For you two. She thought you'd be married out there one day. A... Christmas marriage, of course. some things don't always work out the way you wish. Even on Christmas. Yeah. here. Jack, you don't need to get me any... it's Christmas, coop. Everyone gets a present. ah. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. As opposed to when you keep your opinion to yourself? How could you just let Sam leave again? You were supposed to learn from history so you don't make the same mistakes. And, yes, I said "mistakes." you could have given Sam a chance to figure things out with you before. But maybe you were too nervous that she'd break your heart if she left, that you did it first. Don't make the same mistake twice. Jenny, I'm trying not to hold on to past. you're obsessed with the past. You love her. But it doesn't matter what the story is on the inside if you don't show it on the outside. Open it. Yeah. A new phone. Why? It may not be something you wanted, but I figured it was something you may need. Okay. Thank you. Jenny, I'm gonna need your help. I've been saying that for years. we rolling? Hey, guys, merry Christmas. Uh, I'm using a new phone. My amazing sister is filming me, and I have no idea what I'm doing. But someone once told me that this is a good way to get a message out to the world, and I have a Christmas message that needs to be heard, not necessarily by the world, but by special woman named Sam. Sam, I hope you're watching this. I wish I could say this to your face, but here goes. Um, some of you may not know that Sam and my story started right here in bell harbor, just two kids who liked to play at the same lighthouse. And after all those years, it was at the harborfest where we hit a fork in the road. Sam, I really hope that you're watching this right now, because I don't want this to be the way our story ends. Me, either. did you see that? Yeah. A lot of people saw that. There's, um, some women getting a little crazy with their fire emojis. coop, I ... Sam, no, let me. Five years ago, I wanted to ask you to marry me, and instead, I let you go. I didn't give you a choice, and... I will now. Sam, I want us to be together. But this is your home. I can't take you away from that. Sam, you're my home. You're the place I want to live. You are the person I want to be with you, the feeling I want to have. Come here. you found the perfect spot for it. A place where it will live forever. Sam, I hope that we are back here next year at Christmas. But I don't need to stay here, because bell harbor isn't home without you. And I'm not sure exactly what this means, but hashtag, "I want soop for Christmas"? you're my home, too. coop! I have it. Coop, what's he...? I know that you said that some things can't be fixed. truth is, we were never broken. Our story's just beginning. Sam, will you marry me? yes. Welcome to the club, pal. Jenny, were you filming that the entire time? Uh, yeah. I'm doing it for the fans. Oh, that reminds me ... hold on. are you making merch off of us? Yeah. Someone's gotta make a buck off this whole thing. thank you for everything. Thank you, samwich. And I don't think Rita could have ever imagined a more perfect harborfest. Do we have a plane to catch? No, I told josh that if they want me to host a special, then what better place to host it than right here in bell harbor? You sure? Yeah, we'll leave after new year's. Although I do have a few ideas on how to improve the show. Hmm. Sam and coop! Whoo! merry Christmas, everyone, from here in bell harbor. So many of you watched as we renovated this inn that we thought it would be fun to share with you the best parts of it today, including this guy ... my new co-host and fiancé. come on. Don't be camera shy on me now. the key to a great Christmas renovation is finding a way to save things that matter the most, 'cause some things aren't replaceable. And you never know. Sometimes you can take something from your past and make it even better.
