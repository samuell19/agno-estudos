Concentrate, please. Because, as you put it, the show is on. Concentrate, please! Because, as you put it, the show is on. Concentrate, please. And as far as the name Bota, you stop at nothing to slander the name of Bota and Dora Bota herself. When the subpoena came for Dora to appear in Nyon, as a witness only, my first reaction was to insist on a lie detector. Dora Bota staged the cup finals. Who benefits... who benefits from that kind of writing about Croatian football? Who? Well, sick people. Dora? Thirsty? You've grown. Go back to bed. Go on. Concentrate, please. Because, as you put it, the show is on. And as far as the name Mamiæ, you stop at nothing in order to slander the Mamiæ name and Zdravko Mamiæ himself. What's up, puss? That's how they say Hello Kitty in Bosnia. Don't fuck me with the redneck lingo. Wait, I haven't started yet, but I'm up for it. Well, I'm not! Go to sleep! Mamiæ, referees and mafia staged the Cup finals. Who benefits from writing that about Croatian football? Who? Well, sick people. Police. Search warrant. Get out! What is this? Mommy! Mommy! Come here, honey. You motherfucker! Dora, go to your room. Get in now! Wait here, precious. Wait here, Mommy will get your things. Wait. I told them you got nothing, neighbor. -I know. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! The freezer. Excuse me, sir... -Give me a break! Give me the child! Screw this moron. Gotta go to work, kids have school. You can watch me dress. Come, Dora. Hurry up. Dora, get dressed. -You come with me. Dad, you're having a fasting test. See? I almost forgot. -You won't die of hunger. Where's your bandage? I'm in a hurry, quit fucking around! Tell that to your own father? Shame on you. Well, you are. Where are you off to? I have the shooting. Measure light carefully, so it's not too dark or too bright. I don't shoot. Does it hurt? A little. Is this too tight? -Not at all, honey. Need help getting dressed? No, I can manage. Go, Ives. Give me your hand. Measure light carefully. Oh, motherfuckers. Now you're gonna get it. Motherfuckers. Ives... -I'm keeping it! Ives! -What? Scram! Give it back. Will you pay for the new window?! Shit, took me three months to scrape up for this one! For the last time! Kicking the fucking ball with complete lack of talent. Cut the crap. Well, it's my crap. Jesus! -I'm sorry. Watch it, you lunatic! You could've hit my baby, you stupid fucking cunt! I'm sorry. -You're a stupid cow! Have you seen it? She didn't even apologize! -Yes, ma'am. Shut up, you'll have 5 more at least. Watch where you're going, cunt! Almost hit your baby, huh? -Yes! A cunt who yells, "You fucking cunt" is not a ma'am, but a cow! A breeding cow. Taking a baby out in this freezing cold! Why are you rambling in the freezing cold?! Working, so the likes of you could loiter about! Get away from me! Shut up! Shut up! That's it! Hit it harder! You stupid fucking cow! The world is swarming with idiots like you! Swarming! I just went out for some brandy for a cake. Fucking bitch! You shouldn't get so upset. Snow yesterday turned almost all the inland Croatia white and continues to fall today. The next three days will be progressively colder. More snow is expected on Saturday, but tomorrow it will gradually cease to fall everywhere. Marin! Marin! Marin! A young man in a car, unconscious, in front of my house, 26 Dvorièak. I don't know if he's alive. Yes. Yes, I'm going out right now. I can't open the door. No, no reaction from him. His eyes are open. Young man! Young man! Fuck! A young man, overdosed. Immediately send... I don't know if he's breathing, he's locked inside! One-two-three-four-five. One-two-three-four-five. One-two-three-four-five. Bravo! It's okay. It's okay. Grandma will pick you up. Jan wait for Dora. Tell the teach. Is Daddy going to jail? -No. Police were checking our house for safety. Liar. Stop it. Will he run? -No. Don't worry. Go on, give Mommy a kiss. Mommy has to run. Hurry! Bye. Let's go. I really don't get this. The new forms. Give me a pen. -Come. Come back a second. Look! For personal use. Wait, dammit! Hey! Wait, pal, it wasn't me! Only you and him knew I had the merchandize. Suspecting me?! -When Dario gave me, only you, that little shit, Dario and me were in the bar. Would Dario rig his own stuff? You're gonna hit me now?! Is this how you pay him back? -Why beat Rale?! He hid you in his home! Why hide Dario's merchandize? Is he your friend? Let's just have a drink. -With 10K euros gone? Lose that face, we'll find out who ratted out. It was someone from here! -Vedran, we'll find out who. Fuck, don't turn around. -Retards... shut up. You're all real retards. Look how the kids stare at you. Ah, the legend from the photo. If the S.W.A.T. only knew there's nothing to bust out with billies... Pour us another round and give some to the boys. Are you a big girl who can keep a secret yet? A secret not even Daddy should know? Cut! Well done! Well done all. We've got this on tape. Thank God! Get lost, you're making me nervous. Next scene; Anabela comes home... -Anastazija you mean. I'll never remember all the stupid names. Pedophilia?! What is she doing? What's with pedophilia?! Call the studio, tell them to retake. No pedophilia in that scene. The sketches? I'm so embarrassed... -If it's about the job, don't be. The wall in the sketches was dark bordeaux. There's no such color! We agreed! Tell Ives to retake the last scene. Nataša is not happy with it. She noticed pedophilia insinuations. What do you mean, she won't? Show me the sketches. Excuse me. -Yes? I need a substitute. -No. It's really urgent. Leave. See you in 15 minutes. End of the shift. -No! Need to pick up my kids. She won't retake, she wants a reason. Thinks it was good. What is it today?! We have a meeting, leave. We'll take care of it in 15 minutes! Every few minutes! She wants me to walk. Fine. Show me the sketches! -You guys rig all our deals! Enough of the "you guys" crap! Silence! Go home and don't come back. You disturb the crew atmosphere. Goodbye. I wasn't clear enough? You just got fired. Here I come. Hi. Sorry, I went to the bathroom. Ok, so... Just so you know, the boss is coming. -Oh? Let her. Doc says, I'll do it for free, 'cause the new lover shoots blanks. Doc, no shooting bullets today, but I'll cheer you up with something similar. You're on the table, you're just done and tell her to get dressed. -Yes, action! Isn't that a table scene? -Yes, but you're lying. But I'm wearing a costume. -We'll take it off. Right! Tell someone to bring that sheet. Alright! Wow, I haven't shaved my legs... -Come on, no one will notice. And I'm examining her? -Right. It's not in the script, but can I say... Nope. -Okay. Just asking. Okay, but no. -Okay. This scene here. -Okay, but... I haven't rehearsed it on the table. What's my line? -You say... Ah... it's not enough to want a child with me He won't have himself examined. Nothing's wrong with him. I was listening to that fight. What did she do? Have you seen it? The kid's a genius! -Genius?! For not sticking to the script? She never... Now it's like a movie. She didn't change a word! She changed the context. The scene now has a different meaning than what's in the script! It's not a movie. Our audience doesn't want horrors! We have a bigger problem. What? -I'll tell you later. Did you talk to Filip? -No! And I won't! Hi. I saw the cover of Gloria, you look great! Photoshop, but thanks. -Your hand? Don't ask. Gotta run. So it's all settled. Smile, will you? We got rid of those parasites. -They are, but I feel awkward. Likewise! Will someone pick up producers from Belgrade and Ljubljana? Of course. Squash again, Natasha? -I wish! Stop idling about and write! -You'll like the next episode! I hope so! Two cars or one? -One. They're thin enough. The papers want the story about you saving that boy's life. No! The kid overdosed. I'm not going to sic the press on him. This is in? -No, left out, and she'll improvise here. Got a minute? What are you doing? Where does it say Daniel is a pedophile? But it's a good teaser. Plus it's vague... You will never ever change the scene context on your own! We have people who decide that. What do you want? A scene like this... "What do you think?" "No, it will be absolutely huge!" Who wrote that? He acted it out? -No pedophilia. It doesn't say it's pedophilia! A bigger problem is that the bad guy is asking a 7-year-old to steal her dad's music! That's idiot writing! No pedophilia! It's not clear if it's pedophilia. I wanted to make that scene... No pedophilia. I've said it how many times? Three? Fine. Fine. Another take of the Albert and Danijel scene! It's Daniel, not Danijel. No "j". Another take of the Albert and Danijel without "j" scene! Why do we keep her? There are always trouble on her week. Marin likes her, so does the crew, and she's not bad. Fucked up, but okay. Only she's your job, not mine. -Well, but that couple... Today them, tomorrow other two. Get a grip, I can't do it all. Okay. Dr. Kajp called. Should I confirm the appointment? -Yes, please. You left it in the studio. You gonna answer it? Thanks. Hello? Everyone take five! May I ask you for a favor? I can't leave now. Pick up my father here and take him home. Be sure to let him in. If he doesn't have a key, the neighbor downstairs has a spare one. Thanks. Give this coffee money to the women watching after him. Just text me everything's okay. -Okay. No, no. No eating outside. It's not appropriate. We'll eat at home. Here you go. PRISONERS OF HAPPINESS Now we're going to eat strudel. Magic strudel? -No, no... It's not strudel. Zauberflöte. Mozart. -I don't have the Mozart Balls. Just strudel. I have Zauberflöte. Mozart. Would you be so kind and play it? Ah... sure. The Magic Flute. Two acts, fourteen scenes. A Singspiel. Bye. -Bye, good night. Dad. Dad. Let's go to bed. Come. Um... please... Please, go home. I'm a married man. Dad, let's go to bed. -No, no. Please, leave. I'll be in a very awkward situation if Ema finds you here. It is already late, I'm a married man. My wife's name is Ema. Dad, stop. Ema died. She's gone. I am your daughter, Ives. Please, we're both tired... How about a dinner on Saturday? Or some other day which suits you best. Saturday sounds fine. Come on, Ives. Wake up call! Come on. Get up, it's noon already. You're late. Get up, I've made you breakfast. Ives! Come on, Ives. Ives, come on! Oh, dear God, you have a tough time getting up. It's six o'clock. -You know how time flies. Clench your fist. That's it... keep it up. Great, great. Keep your eyes closed. Spread your arms. Touch your nose. Now with the other hand. You may lower your arms. It's all happening so fast. Sometimes he's completely clear, other times he's a stranger. The latter more often. I know. It's hard when someone close becomes a complete stranger. What about that bracelet? You're going to take it off. You're branding him. It's wrong. Excuse me. PLATES MEDS Hello, Igor. It's me. Could you put me up for work next week? FILMS MEET THE FACES OF DEMENTIA No, why? Last week was cool. No, I'm taking out a loan and I need the dough. Fine, okay. Deal. Great. Talk to you later. Thanks. Bye. We can't grant you a loan until you settle all the credit card debts. I don't have any debts. You don't actually. But the membership fee was charged to your old account. The one I closed? -Yes. It was charged and it is now in the red. Fine. I'd like to withdraw 100K and I'm out of here. But the account is closed. How did you charge it for the membership fee then? So give me 100K kunas. Impossible. -I want to see the manager. You're eye summoning him? -Calm down... I'm calm, I'm only asking. What's his name? I guess a Miljenko would be a suitable person who runs this pharmacy. Let me give it a try. Miljenko! Where are you at? Must be in his own cubicle, his own little space typing, doing jack shit! Miljenko! Or maybe a Drago, a perfect name for a branch manager. Drago! Come! Fucking slackers! Nobody works here! Dickwads! Oh, you're Drago? You sure look like one. I'd like my 100K. -How may I help you? 100K will do. Vlado! Unbelievable! -Vlado! Fucking unbelievable! -Calm down. Why would I calm down?! Vlado! Unbelievable! Will you give me the 100K? Huh, Vlado? Bunch of worthless fucks! You can't answer a simple question! If you actually worked, the country wouldn't be this fucked up! A bow! -Come. A bow! Come... A bow. A bow! Okay, now seat back. I don't care what they say. I'm branding you because I don't want to lose you. I want a bedtime story. All right. Lie down. Once upon a time there lived a little, little girl. She lived in a beautiful wooden house... on a great river bank. She desperately wanted a boat to reach the island on the other side, because there was this big, beautiful, green tree with a big, beautiful, green treetop. Her dad told her she couldn't have a boat, but she could get a raft if they build it together. When the day came, they set off towards the beautiful island, but a strong wind rose and suddenly the raft capsized. The little girl could not swim, she just waved her arms wildly. Her dad also started to wave his arms and it made the wind stop. The river was calm once again and there was not a sound around anymore. They are leaving you the cornices and the curtains. It's all new. Hello? I can't now, I have a client here. Hey! You missed us, you soap junkie, huh? -I got hooked. I'm not discussing the script with you! The producers wanted your character out, not me. Get it?! I take each my role seriously. But these scripts are written by retards! I've no idea what you're talking about. I just came. I could've rejected that script, but I didn't, because I hate you! Guys, guys... New scenes arrived. Don't know what's up. They want to kill Albert, probably wants more money. Really? Ouch, stop that! -Okay. You suck. Off you go. Oh, my, it's gonna be a hilarious week! No! No grocery bags! Who's gonna take him for a bank robber? Put a jacket over his arm. Like he's hiding a gun. And let's rehearse! How many scenes today so far? -23. We may break a record. Like hell we will. -If someone asks me... "What motivates me?" Cover my wrinkles. Not too much blue! Enough, come on. Let's shoot. I never get any make-up! -Yours is natural beauty. Guys! It's Marin! Please, come! Come on! Good evening. Please, sign here. Here you are. Here? Thank you. And the blanket, please. Is that all? -Goodbye. So long. It was lovely. You have to leave now. It's late. I'm tired. You are so rude! Get out of my house! Get out! I can't stand you anymore! Why should other people take care of you? Dedicate their life to changing your underpants and sheets! You don't give a fuck about me! The only thing you care about is your own ass! Your hungry ass craving bakery! Shove a fucking pretzel up your ass! Do you even know who I am to you? Who am I to you? A fucking nurse! Tell me, who am I to you? Give me that. I then realized there was no help or hope and was overwhelmed by horror I had never experienced, except maybe in those rare, horrible dreams, because I knew we were helpless against stupidity and selfishness when they take on that moving and divine form. I spoke like a man fighting for his life. Into my house you chanced and unpacked your feelings. You have found me to exert your good deeds on? Get out now! Out! Out! I remember no more. I do not... You know how time flies. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Which scene is he in? -They want to justify Anastazija, because she left her family for a rich guy. So now they are introducing her demented father. Motivation? Don't ask. Hey, Ives. Do you speak any foreign language? Sure... "Where are you going?" -Great. Could you say a line in one of those languages? That one I don't know. You don't know this one? Choose any language for that one sentence. So he is a professor, talks in different languages while at breakfast. And he loses his train of thoughts when talking in this languages. I love him, but I can't stand his illness. Right. You love him, not his illness. Illness is not your father. I'm thinking, since we're a father and a daughter, maybe we could have our own little thing while we dine... Fine, fine. I'll watch this on video assist. -Okay. Because we're alike. Ives. My Ives. What's that? Make-up. A butterfly's kiss. But how? Russian I went for a morning walk and I saw... and I saw a lion. Russian The lion came up to me and asked... Came up to me and asked... The lion asked... Asked... I forgot what it asked. It asked, "Would you like to come home?" I do. Do you like it? -They're beautiful. Would you like to dance, young lady? No, no, no. I lead. Men always lead. Daddy, I need to pee. What are you doing here? -We ran away. Granny's asleep. Dora, what are you doing here? Granny's asleep. -Heard that already. Daddy, Granny has no teeth. She has... Granny says the Devil will take you again. Will you disappear again? I'm going nowhere. You've been drinking, you're lying. -I have, but I'm not lying. Daddy, I need to pee! Come, you can't stay here alone. Wait here and sing. Why? So I know you are here and you're OK. Dora, I can't hear you. Sing. They'll say how they sailed away Those who never set their sails For them I am but a cursed boat They will claim, almost bragging How I flinched before a dragon And I watched... Daddy, I need to poo. -...how they gloat. What brought these wrinkles you should know And the dust that hurts my eyes Just few of us have reached that shore Where storm is raging up above. They'll swear by their empty prose Pecking like a flock of crows At my misinterpreted words... I'm done. I counted the crucified The justified and the excepted ones Wasted is this humankind Only rare ones find the rare ones I know you long for resurrection That timid silhouette There I... ... had you in my breath. You remember the Lullaby? Daddy! We haven't washed my hands. You're right. We'll do that at home. Wait here. I heard what happened. Everything ok? -Yes and no. You have to wait for that money. -No sweat. We'll figure it out. Take kids home. They'll catch cold. You're it! You're it! I just tagged you! You can't have that. Go play in your room. Scram. Beat it. The room! You are an alien! You are, and a big one. You are! Die, monster! Come here! Come here. Here! Dora, come here! Come here both of you! Listen carefully. Never ever go out alone again! Is that clear? You hear?! Now be quiet. Not a sound from you! Get out. Get out! I don't want to see you ever again. -Calm down. You don't care about me or what I went through while you were cruising from Bosnia to Spain for 4 years! At least prove you care for kids! I was sending money, I called... -Fuck the change you sent! And postcards... from Bosnia! Phone calls from all the shitty places! What do I do when you call from an unknown number?! "Hi! Your new number, hun?" "Fucked any new whores in Utrecht?!" Know what? You can't stay here anymore. Lidija, give me a chance. That stuff wasn't mine... You're so fucked up! Totally! I can't stand it anymore! I lost my tears because of you! Asshole! I hate you! -I know you do, but I do have a plan. You get out of here! Get out! Calm down. You know what? I don't hate you at all. You understand? You are nothing to me. I don't even like you. You physically disgust me. Get out. Imagine you go to a pool for fun, you get a fungal infection and you can't get rid of it. You go to a small pool, people wash their feet there and nobody gets infected. Pussies. 45 minutes to Disneyland. Let's go. I feel you don't love me, that's why I can't. I love you. No, you don't love me. I can feel it. You're just tired. -I'm not tired. You are somewhere else. Me not loving you? Scorpio, love... Emotional situation incomplete and uncertain. Your partner will awake your suspicion... Cards and horoscope mean biz... tell how it is. What's ringing? I hear nothing! Lidija came for the kids. -Thank God! Hi, honey, come on in. They gave you hard time? -You know, they did. Regular criminals. From now on I call them orcs. Walk! -I am. Nobody wants to babysit you anymore! I don't want that drunk hag or your dumb friends babysit me. And your dad's friends are astrology physicists! Astrology?! You mean astronomy! Your friends are into astrology. -Stop laughing. What... what are you laughing about?! Keep on walking. Walk. What are you looking at? What are you looking at?! Jan! Jan! Whoever the coach is, I'll go into the locker room when we play like we did that last game. Next time I'll grab the guy's throat and lift him six feet up like I once did to a player in Varaždin. I got an F in math. -And now what? Nothing. This is for recycling, not my folks. The dark guy is hot. -He's not bad. I like none of them, but I should already keep a close eye on them. Why? One day I'll be selling them. Selling them? What? Like chicken in a super-market? -Buy one, get one free. No. That way you earn more than cooking and cleaning for them. They have enough cash to afford a cleaning lady. Then you have to make out with them. Yuck! You licked me! Let's go. What's that? Weed. Where did you get it? -I took it from my dad. Your dad smokes weed? -Yes. My head's spinning. So let it spin. Cool! Like a merry-go-round. Four more. You'll run for me, chickens. Dinamo, our life! Mamiæ, philistine, leave this sacred team! I took the heat long enough, entering the locker room, risking my reputation, so they can get their kicks mocking me. "Why is she in the locker room?" I'm saving my neck, for God's sake! I'm saving the club! Whoever the coach is, I'll go into the locker room after a game like the one against Zaprešiæ. Next time... I'll grab the guy by the throat and lift him in the air in front of everybody. As long as I'm here... those not prepared to die for Dinamo... can expect anything. But let me repeat... I'm not threatening... and I'm not furious. And I'm not tired either. Way to go... Dora! How is she? -Terrific. Like you care? I can keep you away from my kids! Our kids! You just want to know what I told to the police. I want to know about Dora. That's why I came. Please, talk to me. -Know what? If you weren't their father, I'd turn you in! I do care about you. I have a plan, wait. Come on! Your plans kept you away from them for four years! You think I plan to live with a moron with a plan?! Listen to me. Get a job. I'm not asking you. Any job. 9 to 5, whatever. Security guard, waiter, garbage man. I don't care. I want you to have a job. A legit one! Hi, hun. I'd bring you the laptop, but Mom won't let me. It's waiting for you at home. Mom's really mad at me. She's quite right to be. You must never do this again. You could've died. -You do it all the time. When you were away, I was afraid you'd never come back. And I was lonesome. Did you ever think about me? -All the time. I was lonesome, too. Why did you leave me then? Because people make terrible mistakes. Don't make my mistakes. You can't copy me. I will change. But you must too, okay? Mom doesn't love me, but she never leaves. You love me, but you leave me. -Mom loves you. We all do, a lot. But sometimes we show it the wrong way or we're out of luck. -Your life line is short. I can carve a longer one, like Corto Maltese. A Gypsy woman told him his was short, so he carved himself a longer one. -Better extend the line of happiness. Great job, girls. Great job. Swing your hips. Keep up the good work. I'll be right back. Hi! No flower shops there, only bakeries. Everything's settled. You just refurbish it. I need a job now! -I have a job for you. A security guard, here. Sleep through your shift, then work on the shop during the day. The night shift? -Yes. Sometimes bosses bring chicks, you don't give a shit. The bosses are kids. The daddy got them this. That one there... Hey, pal. Spoiled brat! When do I start? What about the shop? -I've no money to invest. No need. We have the shop. Just paint it, get some flowers, Marko's best man arranges the papers for you, you get a loan. Plan to toil for that lot all your life? Let's give it a try! Miljenko, where are you at? Must be in his own cubicle, his own little space typing, doing jack shit! Or perhaps Drago, a perfect name for a branch manager. Fucking slackers! Nobody works here! You're Drago, right? Dora, don't be like that, I never find you a husband. You know I'll be straight? Un-fucking-believable! -Calm down... Why should I calm down?! Get out! Let's go! Take everything out! Are we close? You've got to be kidding me! We've invested 70 million and we shall provide new jobs... Let's go. Shall we? Daddy! Albert is running away. Daddy, let me go... They are with me. Wait here. Like it? She wants to take a break, just lying here... The Battle of Thermopig! -Thermopylae! Let me finish first, then we can discuss it. We're entering the gulch. The gulch. -The gulch. Thousands of Persians facing us. -Just 300 of us. Thousands of Persians facing us. Just 300 of us. No surrender! And no treason! No surrender, no treason! Attack! Attack! Arrows! No treason! And no surrender! What's wrong? What's wrong? Dora? Jan? Marin? Dora? Jan? Dora! Jan! Rascals! Marin, come on! Oh, my! Help! Oh, my God... Help! Please, help me! It's Marin! Come quickly! I had to see you. You can't take any risk. Run! I don't care. I only care about you and our child. Hey, give it back! I'll lick pistachio ice-cream off your body. You bring the ice-cream. Now you know everything. -Yes. Daddy! Daddy! Let me go! -Calm down! Calm down. For lunch. Go fuck your own mother! I'd have never accepted without a license. Cool it. The supermarket... Fuck your theories. Success or no success. What do I care about a supermarket here? You said you had papers. What do I do with the paid flowers? We'll sell them at the cemetery. You owe me that money. -Vedran! The picture. So now what? I don't know. Told you. The house registered on his mom's name. She's retired, builds villas. -Who is the guy? The Ministry of Culture, corrupted. Pissed off a politician, 'cause he wouldn't share. So just a warning? -Yes. So he starts sharing. Piece of cake. Try the Lovers' Lane. Bangs a starlet there often. This is the last one. Once you pay off your debt. I don't need it. -Can't fuck without a dick. Just in case. You're not working? I quit. The flower shop failed. No papers. You will never change. You are right. I won't. Because I can't. You think that anyone can change? -Yes, people do change. Who does? When have you seen anyone change and became someone else? I'm trying. I'm trying to put new clothes on, change my skin, new uniform... Till that time give me a break. Give you a break? You don't want me no matter what. You don't accept me. If I were doctor, you wouldn't love my temperament! My character! Me! We'd still have a problem, just a different one. Jan, go to bed. Will you read me a story? -Sure. Come. Which one? The Battle of Thermopig. The Battle of Thermopig... Thermopylae! Oh, you're awake. -Yes. And I'll show you how Daddy reads that story. A big army gathered for a great battle. All 300 warriors were armed to their teeth. They all followed their great leader, Leonidas. In a narrow gulch Leonidas told them, "No treason! No surrender!" Get it? No. Why? Because. Where's Dad? He left. Fell from your handbag... Jan and I accidentally knocked it over. When will you change? Dora. Come here! He left because of you! I hate you! He got a crack in his puss. A swollen nose, black eye... Got free face-lifting. I'm Fix. Speedy. Hi! Let's go! Those photos were sick, man. She really has to put everything online? Like what that chick puked all over you. I thought you'd return the favor. -Almost did! After a bottle of herb brandy... Epic. Look at that idiot... What about that guy you sent to the ER? Let her go! Leave her! Leave her alone, idiot! Where are you going? On a field trip. When will you be back? In five years? No treason. Okay, let's go. You've done a great job, congratulations. Thank you. The ratings in Belgrade are great. She saved a young man's life. We heard! -Come on... Way to go! I forgot all about the first aid, I took several courses. I didn't have time to think. Critical situation and danger trigger instinctive reactions. Besides I have experience, I studied medicine for a year. My late father used to be an army doctor in Belgrade. Your name is Cornue. He was French? -No. I took my mom's maiden name, she's a Cornue. She's French, I have French citizenship, too. How far along are you? -End of the fifth. A boy or a girl? A girl. Here's to the girl! Cheers! Fuck! Edita texted me again. Where do I... You lent me what?! I am flat out! I supported you for 15 years! You supported me?! I contributed same as you! I'd never ask I had! Sell the house. -Find me a buyer? You sell it. Shame on you! Shame on you! -I didn't help you just once. You are a piece of shit. A piece of shit! That's what you are. You've ruined my and my child's life because of that whore! You were never a father to him, never took care of him. Never! You never helped anybody. -What is this, Thanksgiving? He's just as selfish as you. Thinks only of himself. Who's to blame now, Filip or me? -I can't live with him anymore! I threw him out! -Way to go! You are... You are now in my belly and... sometimes you kick me so hard I... I think you will be a little muscle girl. That's the only thing I can feel and I think that... I wanted... I want to say something and leave something for you to have, to know... We will have very little time... We'll have very little time. We won't have time at all for... ...for anything. Hi. I just wanted you to know that I'm very sorry and that I... that I love you and... Would you mind? Not at all. Whatever it takes. Let me help you. Thank you. Help, guys! Guys, Marin! Please, come! Please! It's Marin... Please! Come! What will Marin say? -He's your father. The house is mine as much as his. I can't get anything done. So many things need fixing. What's the use of a man who can't fix a door? All that crap about the role of a father it's so obsolete. Bees, for example, get rid of theirs after the insemination. They may leave drones for warmth, but... -Thanks for the advice. Since we have the radiators, your fate is sealed. Both yours and your father's! Hold on. Just a sec. I'd come on to you if you weren't pregnant! Look! Really, however, you'll give me a sister. You'd come on to me? What are you doing? Now I'll show you! Nataša, I called your cell phone, you won't answer. Marin is in a hospital. He's okay now, don't worry. I'm only letting you know. I'll also call Filip. Talk to you later, bye. Come, let's go! We're shooting the scene 35, episode 112! Peter cheats on Anastazija with the secretary! Sounds familiar? Let's do it! I'm sure the crew finds this scene very amusing. Will you fire her? No. After all, she saved the boss. Let's go, guys, get up. Get up! Quickly! Wake up! Bring me the reports... ...for the sponsors and... What's up? Nothing, slight dizziness. Need to go over the cash flow. I just read my scenes. Why am I an accomplice to a dumb murder? How do I become involved with the criminals? Girls adore me! With me on the run, the ratings will drop! We're in a meeting. Please leave. -This is urgent. If it's not good, we'll retake... The girls will anxiously wait for your return. We did that for the ratings. Thanks for your concern. Edita is looking for you, looks upset. I'm not here. -Okay. Wait, let me deal with it. Send her to the studio, exit 5, so we're not alone. She'll create a scene again, so let there be people. I'm not a snob, but he screwed the lowest kind. People laughed behind my back. Calm down. How can I help? You help Filip, thank you for it, though I can't stand him and his father any more. -I really must hurry. I am embarrassed. I wasn't nice to you, but I know you understand me, especially now after all that. I need a job. I'm getting dialysis. It's torture. Three times a week for three hours. Look. What else can I say? I need money. I have debts. Please, give me a role. You know I'm a professional. Sure. I'll have the casting director call you. Thank you. -Edita... May I clean up? Yes, please. ZAGREB POLICE PREVENTION DEPARTMENT Who's the guy? -You don't know him. How long has it been going on? -For years. And you tell me this now, when I'm hospitalized? You cheat on me, I cheat on you. At least you're not a laughing stock in your company. They found you with your pants down. You can have everything. All my property I made over to Filip. Filip? -Yes. All stays in the family. You look horrible. I'm tired. But satisfied. And the baby? -Not yours. I can demand a paternity test. -And I can disappear. I filed a statement I'm leaving here voluntarily, and the police won't look for me. Cut the crap! If you had any say, the baby would be long gone. Whore! Marin... I'm sorry, we were a mistake. Look! And I fixed the radiators, they were full of air. Look what I found in the shed. A box of photos next to the lawn mower. You really care about memories! And how about this? Unbelievable. -Identical. You wanna go out with me? Meet my pals? I'm tired. Enjoy. A small beer. I'll pay tomorrow. -Sorry, I can't. Oh, my fairy! Your bank! -Right... So kids will be mentored? Yes, if they want to study medicine, they can volunteer in their mentor's team. Most importantly, they'll have emotional support... Something that I never had. What will you do now? You mean, am I going to leave him? I don't get it. You manage the company, and he plays the big boss. You're wrong, he's great in sales. You should see him negotiate. He's charming. Like you. -We've got nothing in common. You two have to make up. And live happily ever after? Like your dumb soaps. But they pay for our drinks. I'm sorry. I keep forgetting who is the stupid one here. Un, dos, tres! Un, dos, tres! Empty place, but you won't let me stay 'Cause I ask for money ev'ry day You hate my guts Fuck you, putz! I will never ever pay your bills 'Cause of you I dress like a swingle 'Cause of me you're still single To your younger sister I said no You're the only one I've ever loved! Empty place around the clock the only thing you miss now is some jock You say to me I'm worst of all Can't you take me back, oh, my love You brought me flowers, yes you did And I soaked up your water like a sponge From that terrace when you waved to me From my bike I took a plunge! Took a plunge! Took a plunge! Puta Madre! Coming. Wait, wait! Go on... Open your mouth. -I'll get fat. You'll be as strong as a lioness! Let me take a picture of you. Wait! Am I so distant that you forget and is he so brave he can steal you that's why you use words so you can tell me your lies. You're my daughter's brother. Maybe Marin is not my father. This is better than my story liners! Or worse. Yes? OK, meeting on Thursday at... I'm sorry, I don't have my organizer here. Can I call you back? Can you finalize the lease contract? Already have. And we need you for the buyers' contract. In a minute. Hi. MRI RESULTS Thank you for the rent. I called you. I also tried through... I have a tumor. A brain tumor. I'll die in... three to four months, they say. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. I'll never forgive myself. I already have! Otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here now. I am not carrying you. I am not carrying you. You carry me. Someone will always carry you. At first that someone will be the wind at your back... and then after that often a stumbling block. But any stumbling block can be made into a stair. Or a foundation stone. Don't be afraid, you can do it. Good morning. -Bota apartment? Yes? -A delivery for you. Enough! There's no room left. But there's more...
