Sri Ranjith Movies. Production No. 16. All the best! Hello, Suman! Can you hear me? A 24 year old youth is hanging from a building here. It seems he works for a gaming software company. Is there another way to go to the terrace? We still don't know if this is a suicide or a murder attempt. If this is a suicide, the reason might be depression. Everyone is watching him. My name is Shourya. The day I was born was 29th December, 1992. The day I will die is today. There is a small line between these two days. That is life. A small beautiful life. Game over. They say a person sees his whole life before his eyes just before his death. Darn! This is the story of my life! It is my bachelor's party but they are bouncing him. Abhay! This is your party. Our friends got very excited after seeing the wonderful gift I brought for you. Please don't mind. A gift? - Hmm. For me? - Yes. - Abhay Abhay! Abhay! This is my gift? From tomorrow, this will be your Taj Mahal your White House and your permanent house. You will have a house but it won't be yours. You will have a TV, but the channels won't be yours. Your cupboard and bedroom won't be yours. In fact, your own life won't be yours anymore. So this will be the only place left for you to cry your heart out and to wipe your tears. The throne is yours, O King! Go ahead and sit on it. Come on, I say. - Hello! I chose love marriage. Nothing of that sort is going to happen to me. Your life takes a twisted turn as soon as you place the ominous word marriage beside the word love. If I've to describe this to you in the gaming language from now onwards your life is like Temple Run. You'll die if you stop running. God Himself can't save you from this Angry Bird. Basically Bro, your candy is crushed forever. See! How? ‘Baby, where the hell are you?’ ‘I’ve been waiting for from 8:30.’ ‘You told me that you’ll be here in half an hour.' 'You know how much time it takes to get here?’ ‘You’re never come on time. I’ll never trust you again.' 'I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.’ He can change his cell phone but not his wife. He’s done for. Shut up! Are you married? No. Are you married? No. Are you married? Then why the bloody crazy fish fry the Istanbul sentimental space ship of the condemnation of dictation of the examination of your faces? Wow, man! “I married lady named Lily.” “She’s my best friend’s sister.” “I thinner, she thicker. I blacker, she whiter.” “I and she so romantic but yeah.” Really? “I love to wash the clothes.” “She loves to hand me the soap.” “Every day I cook the food.” “And happily, she eats full meals.” “I washer, I cleaner, I cooker, I scrubber.” Scrubber? “She getting anger, doesn’t hold it for longer.” “Pinching me, hitting me, kicking me, punching me.” So cute, dude. “She calms down on the spot.” “Another word from her and I get angry. Sweet life with cute wife.” This is not a sweet life. It’s hell, man. Sucker! “She’d kill me if I don’t say that!” That’s why this is my kind advice to all humankind. “Advice, advice, advice.” Poor Abhay! He looks like a lost chicken found at Panjagutta Flyover. Your words must have confused him even more. Friends are supposed to help each other. Even though my words hurt him today later he'll keep my photo as a wallpaper and worship me. You rascal! Jhansi in 7th class. Swathi in 10th class. You knew I was interested in them but you snatched them up. This time around, I was very careful and for 3 years I secretly dated Soumya without informing any of you. I fell in love with her and convinced her to marry me. But what did you do? You tried to ruin that as well. You'll get married before me and you will suffer badly. You will wash pajamas, skirts and live a miserable life. This is Abhay's curse! I curse you! Curse my foot! I'm a Superman wearing red underwear. Nobody can harm me. I will get a one million dollar US project in two months. Once I step into New York, I will never come back. Catching me will be difficult, impossible even. Run like in the movie 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'. Like him. What? No! No! How could she do that? She did it as easily as popping a mint in her mouth. It looks nice in video games and movies but seeing a lady beat up a man in real life was scary. Abhay! I have a doubt. You better see if Soumya is capable of such action. How could she do that? I don't think he'll want to get married now. How could she do that? Huh! - Brother! What? Didn't you like it? I made the corrections you wanted. Oh dear! What else do you want me to do? Answer me. - I want Shourya! When are going for the demo? Hey! Who is this Spiderman? The gaming expert who tested Road Ramper game and helped me to fix it. My little brother. Meet Kartik. - Hi, Kartik! He hugs anyone who says hello to him. He had 4 days holidays, so he came to Hyderabad. Going back today. - That's enough. Go bring your bag. Otherwise you will miss your flight. Come - Let's go, Spiderman. What is that look? Are you feeling sorry for him? He is not dying from cancer. Just Down's Syndrome. It is a condition he was born with. He has more chromosomes than us. That's why he does things in a different way. That's it. I see. - Did you feel anything when he hugged you? I felt something. - Really? Check your phone. Huh? - He stole it. He will crack your password and read all your messages. Go bring your phone. Go quickly. Hello! Yes, dad! What? Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? Uncle, I'm Ramu from Vizag. Grandma Jhansi Laxmi is very serious. No, no, the doctor said that she will die this time. He said that she has only a couple of hours left. All of you please come here as soon as possible. Hello! Hello! I lost my mother when I was just 5 years old. My grandma raised me and my brother so lovingly. Now I have to pour Holy Basil water in her mouth. By the way, did anyone bring the Holy Basil water? Shourya! - Hmm? Where is your brother? He is at Aunt Laxmi's house, mom. Is Mr. Shyam's family coming from America? I informed everyone. But it is difficult for them to come immediately. They will come for the main ritual. I feel these are just excuses. Last minute flight tickets will be expensive. And they don't spend a single rupee without discount. You know that well. - I want to know who all are coming because then we can decide if we should wait for everyone or take grandma's body today itself. No, no, let's finish it today. Gnyanapuram is close-by. They have electric cremation there. Everything will be done in a second. Listen! Whenever we bought fish in the market she always insisted that she would cut the fish herself. She cleaned the scales with ashes and then cooked them. When she cooked fish curry the whole street could smell the delicious aroma. She told me a thousand times to learn the recipe. I was a lazy woman. I didn't listen to her. Now she can't tell me even if I'm ready to learn. I'll never have the chance to eat her fish curry again. I'm so unfortunate. What can I do? Satti! - Yes, mother? They have 'Samosa' (stuffed and deep fried dumplings) in the canteen. Buy them for me and call me outside. I'll come out. Don't let anyone see them. Otherwise everybody will just be jealous. Come on, go. Okay. - Oh dear! Hello, Doctor! - Yes? You said that she has only a couple of hours left. - Hmm! Now the time is 10:30 am. Will grandma die by 12:30 or 1:00 pm? What is your doubt? No. After what you said, I've no doubt that she will die. But then, actually you know how it works. We want to go for the electric cremation. And there are power-cuts in Vishakapatnam between 2:00 to 6:00 pm. So, if she dies before that Do you want me to kill her? - Not at all. I'm not asking you to do that. I know that she will definitely die as you said. - Huh? Forget it. We will do what we can. Brother! Actually, we don't have confirmation that she will die. Action! Excuse me, the patient is conscious. Huh? Grandma! Grandma! We are 100% sure that she will die this time. Yes. No, the doctors are good. I told you, she will die. Everyone ran inside now to see her for the last time. Oh dear! Listen to me. Just take the next flight Excuse me! She is out of danger. - What? Out of danger? What kind of torture is this? This is the third time in this month. You take that old lady and put her on a bed. I call up everyone like a crazy man. Everyone comes rushing in a flight or a train. When everyone is finally here the old lady sits up again. What is going on? Answer my question. What kind of torture is this? Grandma! Grandma! Hmm? JLo Darling! What is this? How are you feeling? You're making everyone crazy. You should've been named Jennifer Lopez instead of Jhansi Laxmi Bai. If you can make people crazy at this age I wonder what you would've done when you were young. You never let anyone catch you. You make everybody dance to your tunes. I should pull your cheeks. Okay, are you on Facebook? No? Keep yourselves updated. We used to take 3 months to say hi to a girl. Now, they say hi to us when we send a friend request. I've been meeting all my old friends. Even total strangers are my friends now. Really? - Yes. I'm here. - Oh! I will call you later. - What are you doing on FB? You opened an account for me so that I can stay in touch with my friends. I asked you to stay in touch with your friends not my friends. I know your friends too. So? You'll send a request in FB and say Hi? Why did you post Dipti's photos? I didn't post those. She tagged me. Sweety saw all the photos that you tagged. Why wasn't Sweety there in those photos? Dipti and Sweety can't stand each other. You are a common friend. Help them to patch up. Don't let them fight like that. - They are fighting for me. Huh? Oh I see. But why are you chatting with my friends, dad? - Wait! Looks like your mom is in a good mood? Sir, there is a curfew in the kitchen. Don't go there. I'm warning you. A person should scold or hit someone when he is angry. Why does madam prefer to cook when she is angry? She has made 12 curries and 3 kinds of stir-fry. It's okay if she just cooks and forgets about them. She gets upset if we don't eat all that food. But I like her style of revenge. My grandma raised me with so much love. I was so scared to see her in the hospital that day. She is alive. Why are you crying now? I'm glad that she is alive. If something happened to her What is my grandma's wish? She wants to see Shourya's wedding. That's it. I've been begging them for the past 6 months. But nobody in this house is paying any attention. They will listen, don't worry. What is Shourya's age? He is same age as my eldest son. Shut up. I already gave birth to him at that age. But times have changed. Nothing has changed. I'm an unfortunate woman, that's it. So much is going on but do you know what my husband said? He didn't say a word. He will not ask his son to get married. After retiring he became like a young boy. Your husband is not so old. Get up. Don't you have a husband and a family? Will you sit in my house 24 hours a day? Go away. Possessiveness. I like it. Stop! Will you go if I ask you to go? Sit down. Sit down. Look, Prasad! You both can continue your romance. Why do you want to force me into marriage? You have no choice, my son. A man should endure all such things, even marriage. - Dude! Hi, Nagamani! I'm here! Hi! - Oh dear! - Come on. I was just thinking of you. I-pad Ammakka will appear as soon as you think of her. Who is this? My friend Laxmi. You are a beautiful woman. Look at me. Oh, my God! It’s so hot and I’ve got to wear this wig. I hate these summers, these wigs and these troubles. - Ma'am Nagamani is my friend. We can talk freely before her. That won't be a problem at all. This is something called a corporation look. This girl made me dress up like this. Corporate look, ma'am. Oh dear! Since I deal with rayal families all the time I have to look a particular way. - Royal families, ma'am. Oh God! I can't take this anymore. I called her from Kerala to teach me English. I haven't learnt to speak any English yet but she found a Telugu boy, got married to him and learnt to speak Telugu. Please find someone for my son, Ammakka. Of course, Nagamani. This is I-pad 2. It has photos of all average looking girls. This is I-pad 3. All high-class families. Posh looking girls. This is Apple. You have seen ripe guavas bitten by parrots similarly they are selling this with an apple bitten by a rat. It is very expensive. If we put your son's degrees, complexion, height and photos in this and run it, it will make farings. - Ma'am Be quiet. I know. Watch the show. - Look at this girl. Isn't she nice? She is okay. But she is a bit dark. She looks better now. Her complexion improved a lot after she bought 10 kilos of Fair and Lovely cream and applied it. After a month, she will look like a whitewashed wall. What is this, Ammakka? None of these girls are good. Don't say that. Within a week, if I don't impress you by bringing a beautiful girl to meet your son I-pad Ammakka will change her name. I swear on Laxmi. Done. Your mom is on a roll. - I don't care what she does. Once I go to Hyderabad I will never come back here. What if you mom calls you? - That will be a definite no. Then I’m definitely not coming. Stop it. The girl's father is Mr. Umamaheshwar Rao. - Oh! He is on a very big post in Bejawada. He has power plants, lands, fields and lots of property. He has a very good name in politics too. Do you think it is wrong for youths to desire freedom? You tell me what freedom is. Is it freedom to roam around the city at nights forgetting if you are a girl or a boy? In our society, especially girls have more freedom but lesser values today. Then why did you send your daughter to another city to study medicine? She is Umamaheshwar Rao's daughter. I'm sitting here but I can tell you what she is doing there. Education brings knowledge. But it is our responsibility to teach them good values. Now let's talk about the girl's mother. Her name is Prameela. Prameela Devi. She is from a family of kings. But she is very simple. She looks like Goddess Laxmi draped in a cotton sari. Forget the girl's parents. Tell us about the girl. She is a very beautiful girl. Incomparable beauty. -Wow. She is studying to be a doctor in our Hyderabad. She is not like the girls of this generation. - A Hyderabad girl. She will give her life for culture and values. 'So we are going to see a dead body.' Her way of talking, her grace, it is so beautiful to see. You can't take your eyes off her. She is like Angelina. Angel, ma'am. Angelina is a Hollywood actress. She looks even better than her. Brother, please ask them any questions if you want. Ask. You studied in St. Anne's College in Eluru, right? 1992 batch. Yes. - Yes. Please have some drinks. You said that your daughter is studying medicine. What is she planning to do after her college? In intermediate college she came first in the whole state. We let her continue studying because we didn't want to make her sit at home. We can stop it as soon as the wedding date is fixed. My brother in law doesn't like girls to go out of the house and take up a job. The girl looks exactly like her mother. She looks even prettier in person than in photos. See her. See her. I won't see her even if I die. Lift your head, dear. See her now, son. Please. I won't. I came because you asked me to. Is it the same girl? Are you sure? She is the same girl. She has an unpretentious family like you see in those Kala Mandir sari advertisements. I'm scared that they have a factionist style flashback. Rowdy-ism is more famous in Vijayawada than faction-ism. Take my advice and escape from there. I have a doubt. I'm sure you fell in love with her after seeing her kidnap that man. So every girl looks like her to you. Lol. Okay. If you want to ask me anything, send me a text. I will reply. - Actually I I need I need to ask you something. That day That day There Which day? Where? There Outside that pub you dragged one man into a Sumo and took off, right? What pub? What pub? What Sumo? A man was running like in the movie 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' you were chasing him, then the Sumo, kidnap do you remember it now? - What nonsense? You must be mistaken. I'm a doctor. But I think you are a better actress. Alright, I will ask your dad. Wait! - Hmm? - Please. I'm working as an intern in Hyderabad Gandhi Hospital. Please save him, Doctor.- Okay, okay. He will be fine. Did you give him the injection? Sir, we got the new stock just two days back. How can it be over so soon? There's a shop outside the hospital. Ask them to buy it from there. If they had the money to buy why would they come here, sir? They would go to private hospitals. I don't need to give you an explanation. I refuse to accept this. - Get out! - Sorry, sir. I'll definitely complain about this. - Get out! - Come out. You can't do whatever you want to do. - Get out! 'Later I came to know that the medical shop' 'outside the hospital belongs to his younger brother.' 'He was sending 80% of the medicines to the shop.' 'Then I decided that the best way to deal with a thief' 'is to steal from him.' 'But due to my bad luck the watchman caught us.' Who is that? Oh no! 'And you saw me while I was trying to catch him.' Did you kill him? No, that wasn't necessary. I gave him a bottle of liquor and 5,000 rupees in cash. Now he is quiet. - Thank God! You are too good. So, since we are confessing things I need to tell you something. I don't want to get married. I mean it is not about you. Basically I don't want to get married at all. That's what I meant. That's exactly what I wanted to say. I don't want to get married as well. - That's a big relief. It would be so awesome to smoke a cigarette right now. Is Kings okay? - Even Lights is okay. What did you say? - You want it or not? Yes. You are very brave. This house was built long back. My grandfather had built it. Made each other, aren't they? - Yes. Ma'am! Made for each other. I know. Just look at them. They are imagining us singing a duet. We are dead. - There's another big balcony there. Come. Right. Hmm. Do you want me to light it? No need. Just this feeling is enough for me. Huh? What kind of madness is that? If I really smoke this cigarette, my lungs will become like this. Oh God! Darn! Horrible! Hello! Choose medicine or photography, one of them. Is it necessary to combine both of them? My wish. Why don't you want to get married? Do you have a girlfriend? Or is it something else Nothing of that sort. My family is trying to get me married because my mom's grandmother is going to die. Tomorrow they will ask me to have children because my mom has diabetes and my dad has BP. I'm just 23. I need to see and do so many things. I have to travel around this beautiful world. I have to share my love with many girls. I have to start a million dollar company. Hmm. Basically I have to live my life for myself like how I want to live it. Isn't that correct? I'm a selfish guy. But you look like a simple family girl. Why don't you get married? This! This is what I hate! Everyone wants to decide what I have to do. What did you study? Bachelor of Computer Science. I studied MBBS. - Oh. State topper. I got admission to do Masters Degree in the famous John Hopkins University in US. We can't buy an admission there with money. My dad announced it on TV like it is a national issue. He said that after my marriage my husband will decide what I should do next. What the hell! Until I get married I have to listen to my parents. After marriage my husband owns me. Why can't I have the right to decide what to do in life? That's why I decided that if I can escape from this wedding nuisance for about three months I can then run away to US. If I feel like seeing my mom, I will talk to her on Skype. I will never come back to India. -That's best. I will come to US as soon as my project is approved. We can have fun there. Keep in touch. We can think about US later. What should we do with the present problem in India? You mean our parents? Let me handle it. Story, screenplay, direction by Shourya. Why do the mangoes taste sweet? Are you chopping them for the pickle? - Yes, sir. Which tree did you pluck them from? You idiot. Idiot. I'm a girl too, aren't I? In the little time that we sat there wouldn't I know if he was chatting with a girl or a boy? He got calls and texts from five girls. - What? When I was there with him. How will I feel, mom? I wish I had slapped him When I asked her why she said After marriage I don't want to live with your parents. It's okay, son. She will talk in English and walk around the house like Goddess Laxmi. What? She said she'll throw you out. She said in English that she wants to live separately. What? - Yes. - Did she say that? But you both have to live separately in Hyderabad after the marriage. Right. - Yes. That's right. But who is she to say that? Imagine what will happen if that man becomes the son of law of this family. Your dad will shoot him with your grandfather's gun. And if dad goes to prison for that, we will sit and cry you in a white sari and I in a white coat. Then people like me will look at you with pity. Will mom be able to bear all that, uncle? Tell me. What if she kills you when I'm not in the house like in the daily soap 'Sadist Daughter in Law'? Look at him - Nothing of that sort will happen. You are praying to God for a good daughter in law. What will you do if you get a wicked daughter in law? What should we do now? As you wish. I will marry him if you want me to. If he goes around with other women, burns me with cigarettes, gets drunk and beats me I will never complain to you. Because you told me that a wife should hide everything for her husband's honor. So I will hide them. I will hide everything. I said that. But after hearing what you said, I'm scared. I don't care what happens to me, mom. But if anybody talks against my goddess-like mother and god-like father, I won't tolerate it. I will die. That's it. Huh? Oh God! The let's refuse this proposal. Oh yeah! - Yes! Yes, Prabha. I'm leaving now. Give the keys to Anita. Bye. - Should I pack anything else? There's a lot of place in the bag. Come with me. Why? You will come again. Again? - Do you remember dad's friend in Australia? Suresh uncle? - Did he die? Shut up. His son Balu is coming to Hyderabad next week. What? Is this a game to you? I have my exams next week, mom. Do you really want me to get married immediately and serve tea and coffee to some fool? For God's sake, mom. Please stop all this nonsense for a few more days. Your dad asked me to tell you this. - Shut up, mom. For everything you just say dad, dad, and dad. Go tell your husband that Divya doesn't want to get married so soon. If you force me, I'll never get married. Oh! You won't talk because I asked you to shut up? Fine, don't tell him. I'm not like you. I'm his daughter. I'm not scared. I will speak my mind. Once Divya says no, it is a no. Yes. I wanted to tell them no on their faces. I didn't like that boy at all. I was very sure that he is not as innocent as he appears. I didn't tell you this before but Hyderabad boys are bad. What time are you leaving? - As soon as I finish lunch. You remember Uncle Suresh from Australia? Yes. I remember, dad. His son Kiran is coming to Hyderabad next week. Okay, dad. - Meet him once. Okay. They are a good family. I saw the boy. He looks good. And moreover we know their family very well. Okay, dad. Is that so? Oh dear! I thought it was a good match. Oh dear! Don't be sad, sister. If I can't find a sentimental match for Shourya where is she? Yes. I will shave her head. Not sentimental, ma'am. Say sensational match. A shaved head won't suit my face. I will shave my head. You can wear my wig. You are ready to jump into all conversations. Sister, please don't Inky Pinky Ponky, Shourya is a donkey. Shourya tried but mom cried. 'I-Pad Aunt promised to get you married.' 'Enjoy crocodile festival, son.' You are dead. Now the game begins! Item No. 1. Hi! I'm Jyoti. - Hi! Facebook friends call me Jo. - Shourya. Actually I casually posted your name yesterday asking, How is the name Shourya? I got 200 likes. That's why I decided to meet you. Can you come this side? - Why? Let's take a selfie and post it on FB. If our pair gets at least 500 likes then we can decide about marriage. - Is that compulsory? Item No. 2. - Hmm! Hi! I'm Divya. Yes, mummy. Shall I start? Okay, mummy. Love you, bye. Mummy told me that it was inauspicious time. That's why. - Hmm. Hi! I'm Balu. Son of Satyamurthy and mummy. I mean Malini. Yes, mummy. I didn't tell her about my salary yet. Should I say it including the cuttings or Okay, mummy. Love you, bye. Mummy says hi to you. Oh, I forgot to tell you. My salary package is 24 per annum. 200,000 every month. - Oh, great. I know. Okay, mummy. Love you, bye. One personal question. - Hmm. Mummy asked me to just ask in a friendly manner as to how much dowry your parents are planning to give. I see. In Vijayawada, the land from Krishna Barrage to Bandar Road is all ours. Since I'm the only daughter, everything will be yours. Fantastic! I mean, thank you. I mean, welcome. Item No. 3. Till date, like I had 8 8 and half boyfriends. Huh? Half? By half I mean, there was a boy in intermediate college. His name is Kiran or Karan, or something. But I didn't like him much. Okay. I allowed him to call me his girlfriend on FB. You know, like photos etc But no touching. Hmm? - Item No. 4. Don't misunderstand my age based on how I look. I'm still 25. I became like this because I didn't meet anyone like you. That's it, nothing else. - Hmm. I already finalized a 200,000 rupees package in VLCC. They are basically going to fix everything from my hair to my stomach. - Hmm! It might take 6 months but I'll look like this after that. Hmm. You may wonder why I didn't do this earlier. But I've been waiting till now because I wanted to do it after committing to someone like you. - Hmm. So, shall we commit to each other? Aha! - Item No. 5. What? Are you confused? - Huh. I had lovely hair in the photo and a shaved head here. Actually one rascal spent two years with me in the name of love and now found another girl. - Hmm. He was a big fan of my hair. So I chopped it off. I got this tattoo for that idiot. I decided that whoever I will marry in the future I will lovingly call him Bava. But no problem, I decided to marry you. So this is for you. Muah! Hey! Where is the drink? Actually, I was fed up of this meeting the groom nuisance. But I was very tempted after seeing your photo. Shall I tell you what my inner feeling was? What a handsome guy! Yes, that's what I felt. I've decided. You are the right man for a girl like me. You are lucky. Hey! What is taking so long? Hmm. Every guy I meet is a bigger fool than the previous one. I think my dad is handpicking them for me. I don't want to get married at all. Mom! She is dead. What is it, mom? Did you select another fool for me? I won't meet anyone. I'm so - Hello! Divya! Dad! Chalapati. Mangala Textiles owner's son. They are our relatives. He is going to meet you. Talk to him. - Okay, dad. Will it be a problem? - No. If these meetings and talking are difficult, just say it. We can stop them. - Uh I will select a good boy from the proposals and finalize it. Okay? I gave your number to Chalapati. He'll call you. Meet him and talk to him. Bye, dear. Okay, dad. Hmm. Dealing with parents is an art. They should feel that we are listening to them. That's it. They should feel that we are agreeing to it. That's it. They need to feel that they are controlling the game. But the remote should be in our hands. -Aha. Yes. Learn how to deal with daddies and mummies. Shourya! - Yes? Hi! - Huh? Mom? The watchman was correct when he said you'll be here. Continue drinking, dear. It is okay. Mom, what are you doing here? Yuck! What is this? It has no chili or salt. It tastes horrible. Everyone come to my house from tomorrow. Don't eat this tasteless food. I'll make piping hot onion fritters to go with beer. Yum. Wow! - Mom! What are you doing? Nothing, son. You've met at least a dozen girls till now. You've found fault with every girl you met. You got a letter from the US yesterday. Then I understood your plan. - Yes. You wanted to give excuses and fool me for 3 months so that you can somehow escape to US. Even though I'm not a well educated woman God has given me some intelligence. Actually you inherited your intelligence from me. I didn't do anything such. -No? Okay, swear on me. Swear on me that you will get married before going to US. Swear on JLo. I don't want to swear on you or JLo. I don't believe in it. But I believe in it. Say it or I will stay here until you select a girl. What about Kartik? - Your dad will take care of him. What about JLo? - I will bring her here. To the pub? - No, to our apartment. Huh? - You have three bedrooms there. He is the only one that lives there. - Huh? Why waste all that space? - Huh. What do you say? I will cook delicious food for everyone. Eating outside food will cost you a lot of money. And it is not good for health too. Satyanarayana sir said that on television recently. Okay, I will get married. I swear on JLo. I will get married. Really? - Hmm. May you get married very soon! This is my first visit to a pub. It is very good. Mom, I've been waiting here for 30 minutes. I'm leaving. 'He is our relative.' - So what if he is our relative? Divya! Divya! Do you remember this? Did you forget? You came to Uncle Seenu's wedding when you were little. You stabbed me with this for snatching a sweet from you. Did you really forget it? They had to do a surgery to remove it out. I was so angry that I wanted to slap you hard. But my mother told me that you are my cousin and that you are a relative. That's it. The movie 'Mansanta' was released at that time. Do you remember at least that? - No. Why will you remember? You were too small. You used to reach up to my knees then. What's the matter, Divya? I heard that you are rejecting all marriage proposals. Did you give your heart to me when you were a little girl? Secret smile. Sly looks. Hello! Yes, I'm with her. I'm talking to her. She came here because her father asked her to. She is our relative. She has given her consent. I'll call you later. Don't do that. You already stabbed me once. I almost lost my shoulder. I can see that you are very eager. I have some urgent work in the hospital. How much did you pay for this dress? Did you spend about 10,000? It costs 150 rupees per meter in our shop. You can stitch a pretty dress in just 5 meters. And the stitching will cost you 250 rupees. You will get this dress in just 1,000 rupees. Don't waste money. I've been telling you this from childhood You never listen to me. Bring all your friends when you come next time. We can give them discount. Wait, you don't need discount. The shop is yours. Let's gift clothes to all your friends for our wedding. They will be happy. I said I will call you later. I will break your head. Just a minute. Hello! She is very impressed with my talking. Her photo? Yes, I'll definitely show you. I'm so sorry. Hey, Divya! What a surprise! What are you doing here? - I came to meet a friend. Why didn't you call or text me after that? Divya! My friend from Kakinada is waiting on the line. He doesn't believe that we are getting married. Just talk to him once. Everybody at the village is waiting. Should I ask him to bring dry fish from Kakinada? You used to lick up the plate in childhood when they cooked dry fish with tamarind leaves. I think you forgot. Yes, send them. What's the matter? Is he my brother? Looks like a rich man. Stupid donkey. He looks like a good man. I can't bear it even when my mom talks to me like that. How dare this fool talk to me like that? Divya! Shall we go? Who is this? Your friend? Hi! - Hello! - Shourya. Shourya! Good name, like 'Arya'. I like your shirt. My name is Chalapati. Is this an imported shirt? Footpath shirt. - Footpath? I have everything in my shop. Any brand you want. Kelvines, Jack and Jone there's another one with a hill something Tommy Hilfiger. - Yes, Tommy or Jimmy. You will get whatever you want. Tell me two days in advance and I will get the stamp on it. Any brand you want. Tell him, Divya. It is our shop. Hello, father. My work is done. I'm coming. We have lot of customers today? I'll be there in five minutes. I'm leaving. I'm going to the shop, Divya. Talk to him and go home soon. Come to my shop. Don't forget. Hmm. - Okay? - Hmm. See you later. - Hmm. Hanumanth! We have to do something. Is this funny to you? Your candidate is superb. Shut up. I will wrap him with all the saris in his shop and put him on fire. Fool! He doesn't know me yet. So, finally you are trapped with Chapalati. Good. No way! If I get married to him I will divorce him on the second day. Buffalo! If you put a buffalo in pants and shirt it will look better than him. Beggar fellow! It is better to marry an idiot than to marry him. Fool! - Divya! I love you! - Huh! Actually I think we misunderstood Divya, mom. You misunderstood her, not we. - Yes, me. It seems Shourya's cousins were calling him, mom. We talk freely with cousins, don't we? No. That fellow will change his story every minute, dear. Be happy that you escaped from him. Forget him. No, uncle. He called me so many times after that. How can I answer his calls after you told me not to? So I didn't answer them. Shourya's cousin studied in the same college as me. She came to me, requested me and convinced me. Really? - You are too innocent, sister. Don't believe him. I didn't believe him at first, mom. I swear. Why? Why didn't you believe her? You are like the yester-year actress Savitri. How could she talk like that about you? I warned her not to fool me with her fake tears. Correct. Never see her face again. Dear, when you said no to them the first time I agreed with you. I'm still suspicious about them. I'm sure they cast a spell on you. What do we do now? Mom, you taught me that if we give up on humans when they make mistakes we will have nobody left on this earth to talk to us. Me? When did I say that? I don't know such wise things. Mom! Don't you remember Thursday 1st March, 1995? You said this while you were showing me the moon and feeding me. I remember it very well. That's right. I remember it. Alright, then. What do you want to do now? Your wish is my wish, mom. I somehow feel that Divya will take good care of you. But I leave it up to you. What do we tell your father? Let's file a complaint with the police stating that they are torturing our girl and throw them behind bars. Uncle, please stop. This is our family matter. Mom, you know that only you can talk to dad directly. I'm very scared of him. He left the decision to us. I think Let's do one thing. - What? Let's say yes. - Hmm! Okay. Your happiness is my happiness. Go ahead. Let's do it. 'Chants' 'Chants' How is your knee pain now? My older son recently paid for my kneecap replacement. I can take part in any running race now. Stop your bragging. Who was the doctor? Was it Prasad Reddy? Shut up! Don't you have any shame? Prasad Reddy and I studied together in school. How can I show my knees to him? I saw an NRI doctor named Ramesh. That's right! You are still a college girl. See how she is blushing. Stop it. Did you add carom seeds? We add carom seeds to our fritters. They are delicious. Yes, we did. Nowadays even actors are crazy of cricket. Our Telugu heroes won the cup this time. Did you see it? No, I didn't see.- Are you going to say no to everything I ask? What are you talking about? We came to Vijayawada with high expectations since it is your daughter's wedding. But after we came here we were given a house to stay, a plate to eat and a bed to sleep on. Where are the wedding tent, lighting and decorations? When I asked about it I was told that the wedding is taking place in the temple. Why are you looking to finish it off so cheaply? I didn't get your name. - I'm Ram Mohan Rao. Everyone calls me Ramu. I'm the groom's uncle. That makes me your brother. I'm from the groom's family. Actually the kids - Hello, there! Is this fellow picking your brains? - What's the matter? I asked him why he is doing the wedding in the temple without spending money. Why are you worried about it when we both are not? We are the groom's family. Tell me something. When a man and woman decide to live together why do they need to get married? Can't the start living together directly? Can't the start living together directly? What kind of a question is it? How can they be a husband and wife if they don't marry? Then we can ask the boy to tie the wedding chain in their house or our house. What rubbish! If you hold the wedding in your house how will the public know that they are married? Isn't that what we are doing now by inviting everyone to the temple and doing it in the presence of God? If this is a wedding, what do you call spending thousands to print beautiful invitations spending millions to find the perfect venue filling it with many lights that even night looks like day cooking 150 dishes and celebrating with great pomp? It is called blowing your own trumpet in public. - Huh? Wedding is a tradition, not a pompous display. It is a festival where we invite family and friends and celebrate our happiness with them. We should build our own wedding tent. We should invite our family and serve them food. The whole family should get together share the work load and do it as our own work. Wedding is a happy occasion when Aunts and Uncles older ones and youngsters all get together and celebrate it like the festival of 'Sankranti'. In the world, another person takes all the decision even though it is our family wedding. A stranger comes and does useless decorations. A total stranger serves you food. When we arrive at our family wedding a stranger comes and looks at us like we are guests. We spend millions of rupees for the wedding but we go there like guests not knowing who is a friend and who is a stranger. That is really unfortunate. Our elderly ones were wrong when they decided the rules and regulations for a wedding. They should've stressed that in a wedding three knots and seven steps are important not how much we spent on food and other things. Their girl shouldn't come to our house walking on money. Even if she has to walk on fiery coals she should do so with a big smile on her face. He should be proud that he got his daughter married into our family. He should visit our home for us, not for his daughter. I will be right back. I'm going to receive some of my wife's relatives. You be with him. - Okay. Ramu, come with me. - I'm coming. What's wrong? Did he back out of the wedding? Just tell me. Our Rambabu is sitting in the tent outside with 25 men. Say the word. When son in law came to me and told me to educate four kids instead of wasting millions on the wedding I was very happy that my girl found a good husband. But now I'm really proud that my daughter is going to such a honorable and respectable family. You are a horrible dancer. - You can laugh at me all you want. I feel that this is the last time you'll be laughing in life. Hi, darling! Even if you say you love me I can't accept it now. Because I'm getting married tomorrow. Don't act too smart. Uncle Suri will get suspicious if he hears such dialogues. - Who is Uncle Suri? You saw him at our house. He was sitting with dad. Don't worry. He is keeping an eye on me and following me. What is he doing there? He is looking at me like the villain eyes the club dancer in the olden movies. Do something, Shourya. Actually, no. Don't do anything. Stay calm. Okay? Bye. Do I ever do anything? I just find an idiot to have some fun with. You? Is sister inside? Yes. She is changing money for saris. Go inside. Changing saris for money? Come in. You came at the right time. We are a missing a player. She said something about changing saris for money. Score is 201. Drop 20. Mid-drop 40. Game 1000. Laxmi is in line. Beat her if you can. Don't be confused. Changing saris for money is our secret code for cards. She came up with that name. - Hmm! Otherwise these men won't let us play cards. I don't know this game. You will money if you don't know the game. If you know the game, you tend to do calculations and lose all your money. No. Actually the engagement sari hasn't been delivered. Did the tailor say something The sari will be delivered. Sit here and play the game. If we become too busy with the wedding arrangements we will forget to have some fun with little things. You don't know something. Prameela's husband looks serious all the time but he is crazy about her. I know everything. Now stop talking and drop a card. People are cranes, sister. They spread gossip. Crows, ma'am, not cranes. - Oh dear! This is Telugu language. I will say whatever I want. She corrects me in everything and increases my BP. Oh God! Why do I need to wear all this jewelry drape saris that weigh 200 kilos? Why get married? The wedding is tomorrow morning. I'll get up at 9 am tomorrow. My legs are paining. You are the bride. - Don't I know that? Please don't send Baby to help me get ready. Wear this, my dear. Put this on, my dear. She will just kill me with this torture. In your in-laws' house no one will plead you to do work. I can do my own work. Not just your work, you've to do their work too. I won't have time for that. After going there, don't throw tantrums saying that you didn't like this or that. Prameela Devi! Turn around. Why are you crying? Because of you. You troubled me a lot during my delivery time. You were born two months in advance. You were so little that I was scared to hold you. After you were born, doctors said that they can't say if you will live or die until after four days. What if you couldn't survive? Are you remembering that now and crying? Shut up! Are you trying to tease me? Go. Why wait till tomorrow? Go away right now. Oh, that is your problem. Shall we cancel the wedding? Such foolish talk from you used to scare me. No matter how naughty you were at home till now I overlooked it because I'm your mother. Now you are going to another house as the daughter in law. Please don't hurt anybody's feelings, dear. Henceforth if you make any mistake they won't blame you, they will say I didn't raise you well. Be careful, dear. Shourya! Hey! Your phone is ringing! Divya? Why so many calls and texts at this time? Crap! 'I can't go ahead with this wedding, Shourya. I can't.' 'This is a big lie. Deception. I'm sorry.' 'I'm leaving. Don't try to contact me.' Shit. - What happan? You are right. This is a lie. Deception. This is wrong. What did we talk that day? Oh God! Let me finish. What is the common problem that we both are facing? Marriage. Right? - Hmm! We both are rejecting all the proposals on purpose but our parents are still not giving up. Right? So? -Let's get married. What? Let me finish. There is something called Mutual Consent Divorce. After getting married, if we decide to go separate ways they will give us divorce within six months. Hmm? Trusting him will be like committing suicide. Earlier he made a plot to cancel the wedding. Now he is making another plot to get married. Why didn't anyone attempt it till now if it is so simple? People who do it don't announce it to the world. They do it quietly like we are doing it. If you say no to him, you will be forced to marry that cloth merchant. Think about it. Okay. But I have some conditions. Accepted. Okay. What is done is done. This wedding is a farce. Let's stop it. Let's confess the truth to our parents. Don't worry. I will tell them that this was my plan and take the whole blame. Hmm? I will tell them that you had nothing to do with it. I'll also say that I convinced you to do it. Don't worry. What could be the worst outcome? They will scold me or slap me. That's okay. Everybody will forget about it in a few days. After that, they will get you married to someone without taking your opinion. Am I right? Won't that wedding be a farce? That boy will think that you married him willingly. Isn't that deception? You will be deceiving each other all your lives. Is this what you want? Even though we lie to the whole world we can try to be truthful to each other at least. We are not doing this to hurt or deceive someone. This is our life! We told our parents that we don't want to get married so soon in life, but did they listen to us? Did they give us some time? They are pressurizing us in one way or the other. What did you say that day? Don't we have the right to decide about our lives? Didn't you say that? So we are deciding our lives. Our parents want us to get married. We are doing that. We want freedom. So we are going for the divorce. We are deciding what to do with our lives, Divya. We are not killing anyone by doing this. I'm clear. If you want your life, trust me. This is the only way. Nothing will go wrong. Trust me. What is this? Hey! The famous 3 setup. Fruits, flowers and milk. I need to take a selfie! So annoying. They made me do thousand prayers since morning carrying that 100 kilo hairdo with flowers. I have a terrible headache. Oh God! This is summer and I have molasses in my hair. It is stuck to my hair. Darn! Why don't you shampoo your hair? You put it on my head. Come and wash my hair. Don't give advice. I imagined my first night to be a romantic one. This is exactly how I wanted it to be. Wow! Is everything okay? Do you want something else? I thought so. I knew it. Himabindu warned me too. You'll get me drunk, get me to sleep with you then say Sorry, it happened when I was drunk Hello! Hello! I don't have any such intentions. Himabindu is the one with the magnifying glasses, right? Her ideas are like her face. Put the light off and go to sleep. I beg you. Hmm. I can't sleep. Why? Are you seeing your friend's face as soon as you close your eyes? Just shut up. - Okay. Shall we do one thing? Shall we open the gifts? What gifts? There! Why do we need all these? To open a shop. Have they gone crazy? That's why our country will never progress. I heard that in America they give a store's address along with the wedding invite. They see the list of gifts that the wedding couple wants select one and gift it to them. That's the right way. Why is the light still on? Who is it? - Your suspicious Uncle Suri. Uncle Suri? Hmm. He is checking up on our nuptial night. What do we do now? Are you mental? - Please, please, please, just say it once. No, no, no. - Please, please. It will be fun. Please, please Come here. No, please. I said come. I'm scared. This is my first time. You think this is my tenth wedding? Come to me. Mummy! No, please. Please. No use calling your daddy or mummy. Come. Your parents took millions of rupees as dowry. Didn't they teach you what to do? Come on. No! Please, please Mummy Mummy Mummy! Subba Rao! Come here! - My daughter Divya. Hello! - Hello! She was my classmate. Mr. Shekhar 'So, the wedding is done. What is next?' 'Honeymoon in Shimla.' 'Horrifying Murder in Shimla.' 'Did you see that movie?' 'A public warning. I like it.' 'Okay, okay. I fixed a meeting with the lawyer' 'at 10 am on Thursday. Is it okay?' 'Okay.' So, do you know this lawyer well? Don't worry. I don't know him at all. You don't know him? Come. Fast. I came to Hyderabad this morning. Your case hearing is on - May I come in, sir? Come to the court with the documents I asked you. Have a seat. See you. See you tomorrow. Yes? What can I do for you? My name is Shourya, sir. She is Divya. We want a simple, sweet and superfast divorce. How long have you been - It's been exactly one year. It is our anniversary today. - Then Here are our birth certificates, marriage certificate and all the other documents. Where did you get them from? Once we apply, they grant us a divorce in six months. But we need to be married for one year in order to apply. Don't change your expressions so quickly. We can get anything done by giving money. Why didn't you tell me all this before? I gave you just half the details and you ran away before marriage registration. I couldn't take the risk. So - So we want divorce. No complications. Look, kids. Please think it over. Marriage is a relationship with responsibility in our society. We want divorce. You can take your fee happily. And our parents will do the lecturing. Hmm. - Hmm. Take an application from the front-desk and sign it. Okay, thank you. Hello! - Are you at office? Yes. It is on the ground floor, right? Yes, on the ground floor. Come straight in. I reached. I'm coming in. Mr. Rao! How are you? - Yes. Don't write your home address in Vijayawada. Write Himabindu's house address. - Okay. Submit the file there and go. My assistant will do the rest. He will be in touch with you. - Thank you, sir. Come in, have a seat. You said you will come to the wedding. Did you forget? Sorry, my friend. I had some work in the High Court. I saw your daughter when she was little. Are they in Bejawada now? No, they came to Hyderabad. I didn't inform them that I'm coming because they are a newly married couple. I came this morning on some work with regard to our Rice Mill Association. Mr. Sridhar's office is close-by. So I thought I will meet you too. Recheck everything and submit it in the court. Okay, sir. Sometimes I want feel like giving up my practice. Why? Are they not paying your fee? It's not that. They are paying us money and asking us to sin. Did you see the wife and husband that just left? Who? - Both of them are not older than 25 years old. They got married just one year back. They applied for a divorce. They casually said that it is mutual consent. Celebrating our divorce, my friend. This is the latest fashion in India. She is my wife. Oh sorry, my ex-wife Divya. And he is my XYZ Shourya. This generation views marriage as fun and divorce as party. Serves them right for asking us to get married. We have to get married and give birth to children. Which convent is your child studying in? How much fees did you pay? Will they give discounts if you have Aadhar Card? They want us to live in slow motion with all such rubbish. It is not their mistake. Actually their parents should be blamed. They should be taught about family and family values right from their childhood. They deceive us even if we teach them everything. In front of us they will behave as if they are listening to us but they ultimately do what they want to do. How can we be sure what is true? What we see in front of us or what they do outside? Please stop. It is very scary to imagine all that. Let's be happy that our kids are not like that. Darling! What's wrong? This thing - What's wrong, darling? Did this Aunt scare you? My baby! Does anyone keep a hen in the apartment? Why not? By the way, her name is Kamakshi. They have one in every house in Venice. Eat this, my darling. Eat. Feed it. Feed it nicely. One day someone will turn your hen into Chicken 65. Please don't call her a hen. She is my roommate. Do you know how pretty she looks when she does ramp walk in the hall with her sexy legs? She is just jealous that your legs look better than hers. Ignore Aunt words. She is still drunk from last night. You made me drink it. It is just almond milk with a little hemp. Nothing will happen. - I told you to drink one glass. But you liked the taste and drank three glasses. My darling Okay, whatever. I wish you and your Chicken Fritters all the happiness. I'm going. Okay, then. I'm going to the hostel as we agreed upon. Okay. So soon? Maybe you forgot to say something to me. Try to remember it. I gave you an extra-ordinary idea brought you back when you ran away from home retrieved your life from your dad's pocket and gave it to you - So? Shourya, you are great. You are a genius. Thank you. Can't you say that? I'm hurt. What if my parents call you? I will say that you are in the bathroom. What if your parents call me? - Say that I'm in the bathroom. What if they both call at the same time? They will think that we both are in the bathroom and imagine us singing a duet. - You are so sick. It is a natural talent. Nobody will come here and nothing will go wrong. Be happy. Go without any worries. Trust me. Hmm? The truth. Shourya! Surprise! Train! - How are you? Uncle! Come, come -Train! Train! Yes, Prasad. Wait here. - Shourya was shocked to see us. Wait a minute. - Stop. She is pretty. I'm looking at her. So nice. - Yes, she is nice. Wow, so cute. - Yes, I'm giving it to Shourya. Shourya, talk to your daddy. Were you surprised? When Uncle Singh came to Hyderabad from Bangalore you told him that there's a flat in your apartment. Mom is so happy that they'll be there with you. You remember every word I say. Thanks. I will talk to you when I come there. When Shourya was a kid we were neighbors in MBP Colony. And now Shourya helped us to get this flat. Thank you, son. It is a really nice flat. By the way, my wife Mandeep Kaur. Hello! Both of you come for dinner at my place tonight. We'll play with this. My children. Pepsi Singh. Candy Singh. Cookie Singh. Tell me. Tell. Tell me. Love you, sister. I told you that she will be the first one to talk. Give me money. You can continue. Ignore him. Tell me. What did he do? Tell me. Tell me. After we had dinner last night at Uncle Singh's house I'm leaving. What? What should I say if anyone asks me about you? That is your problem, not mine. We got married. Then we applied for divorce. After that we will go our separate ways. That was our agreement, right? That's right. But But what? Should I sit here like an idiot when you dig up a new hole every day? Your problem, you solve it. This problem will affect both of us. Are you threatening me? - What? Yes, this is what guys like you do. Yes, I'm a conman. I'm a thief. I made this plan to trap you. Let's call your dad and tell him everything. We got married. We made this plan. We applied for a divorce too. Let's call your dad and tell him everything. Then we can be out of this stupid problem. Shourya! Shourya! No! I'm not in the mood to accept your apology. I can't bear this constant drama. You are going out of control because I'm being quiet. Actually I didn't understand what you were talking. My Telugu is a bit weak. I'm still learning. Is this the first fight between husband and wife? Now you are real husband and wife. You didn't eat dessert. So, I brought it for you. Please have it. - Yes. After a fight, the romance is very nice. Enjoy yourself. You should be buried alive! - Idiot! You will have a problem if I get married. You got married, involved us all in this stupid plan and now you are planning to back out of it. I will kill you. Shut up, you donkey. Sit down. Everyone wants to do their own thing. Don't you have any sense? Why will he trap you? If this news gets out, he will be in trouble along with you. Will you talk nonsense when you are angry? Won't you think before you say something? Ask her that. Shut up. You are no less. Irritating fool. Listen, both of you! You both wanted freedom and came up with a plan to achieve it. We warned you against it but you didn't listen. Now you are creating more problems for yourselves with this stupid and idiotic behavior. You have to live together for just six months. What difference will it make where you live? Can't you live like friends? You can go your separate ways after your divorce. There won't be a problem. Otherwise do whatever you want. Okay, I'm sorry. I was rash with my words. It's okay. I'm sorry too. Yes, dad. - When are you coming? What? Do you want me to meet another girl? Someone is coming to meet your mom and me. Idiot. Day after tomorrow is our marriage anniversary. Did you forget? That's right. I'll be there, dad. No. Say that you both will be here. Are you still planning to enjoy a bachelor's life? Bring Divya with you. Divya? - Yes. Divya Dad! Divya might be busy at the hospital. Tell her the occasion. She'll come. Why trouble her, dad? It is our family function. I will come. No need. It is my family function. My wife and I will celebrate it. You can disconnect the call. - No, dad. Wait a second. Day after tomorrow is my parents' anniversary. They are asking me to bring you. I will handle it. That's okay. Let's go. Don't be silly. I can handle my dad. What's your problem when I want to come? - Are you sure? What? You don't want me to come to your house? Be my guest. But later don't say that it was my plot and a trap. Stupid! Kartik! Kartik! No, no Kartik, please. I will cook 'Chicken' tomorrow. What is going on? - Please stop throwing things. Why are you giving him the things again? If I don't give him steel bowls, he will break glass things, sir. That's true. - When did the movie start? Just now, sir. - Wow! So it will continue for another half an hour. I'm going inside. Junior sir asked for 'Chicken' Lollypop yesterday. But madam forgot to make it for him. This is the result. Kartik, please. - I want 'Chicken'. I'm bringing it, sir. - No. No, please. Kartik, please. Mom, let me handle this. Throw it now. Let me see. My God! Kartik, you are so strong. You are as strong as Spiderman. Wait a minute. Are you the real Spiderman? Yes. Oh my God! I knew it. I'm so tired. I'm hungry. I want to eat 'Chicken'. I make superb 'Chicken'. Friends? Friends. - Yay! But let's eat something first, Kartik. - Hmm. Okay? - Okay, let's go. - Let's go. You take some. - This one? Take for yourself first. - Okay. Shall I give you some? - Yes. Who made this? My mom cooked it. Is it nice? - Yes. Now that your daughter in law is here, you can relax. Just take care of me. That's it. Hey! What is this, darling? Don't you take care of yourself when I'm not here? See how weak you became. You are just 90 but you are behaving like an old lady. Don't neglect your beauty. Two, one. Don't you love me anymore now that she is here? Why are you looking at her when I'm talking to you? Divya! - Yes? Come here for a minute. She is abusing you because you didn't greet her. Hello! - It's been a while since we came home. Did you touch her feet? -No. Sorry, grandmother. - Touch her feet. Touch both her feet. Show me your hand. This way. Yes. Don't look at me. Apply it to my grandma to appease her. Apply it. What did you say? She is pretty but I'm better looking than her? Stop it, grandma. She also has above-average looks. Grandma didn't say anything. She said it. I hear it. Nobody else can hear it. Dr. Divya, basically she lost her hearing 3 years ago and lost her speech a year ago. So we talk to each other with our eyes in a romantic way. So, when you said grandma abused me You are such a Don't use bad words before grandma Sorry, sorry. Done. Sir, they said 2 spoons. You should add 2 spoons. That's a TV show. They add too much of everything. We are improving the dish. - Huh! Just smell the aroma. Isn't your mouth watering? We feel the same way when we are about to vomit too. Go out. Get out. Madam, sir is burning the whole kitchen down. Will you please come? He asked me not to come in until he finishes cooking. I won't enter the kitchen. Go away. That's like my wife. Did you see how much she respects me? How is it going? I'm almost done. Just five minutes. If I simmer it for five minutes on low flame and put it off you will forget rice and flat bread and eat only the 'Chicken'. Divya, I cook only on this day in the whole year. Your mother in law waits for this day the whole year. She loves my cooking. Okay, you can go now. Go and freshen up. I will put the stove off. - I'm warning you. Don't add any of you spices in it. Understood? - Got it. Put the stove off exactly after four minutes. Turn it towards your right. Don't get confused. I will know it if it tastes any different. Oh God! Take a look! It is not cooked. Your father in law should just feel that he did the cooking. Otherwise we'll be forced to eat what he made. It's okay since I have to endure this just once a year. Otherwise if I had to eat this every day I would've died. Divya! Hi! Hey, Kartik! Your 'Chicken' is ready. Shall we eat? High five! Kissy! Here? Yay! Go quickly and call Shourya. Okay? He loves you very much. I know it. It has been 10 years since he was born, dear. I didn't sleep peacefully even a single night. But I'll sleep peacefully today. When Nagarjuna cleans the dishes with Tabu in 'Ninne Pelladutha' movie wow, I found that so romantic when I was a kid and thought that if I can do the dishes well beautiful girls will fall for me. But as my luck would have it, my mom was so impressed that she made me wash the dishes when the servant girl took a day off. That's life. Everything doesn't go according to our plans. I'm sharing my life's secrets with you. What is that expression on your face? I'm scared, Shourya. Huh? Will you run away to the railway station again? Please don't. We are leaving anyway tomorrow. Not that. When your mom saw me being affectionate to Kartik What did she say? She said she can relax now because I'm there to take care of Kartik Did she say that? Of course, she will. You took her words to heart and started worrying. No, Shourya. Everyone thinks that our marriage is real. What do we do? What if there is a problem? My mom is big drama queen. There's no need for anyone to take care of him. He will take care of us. I'm there for him. I'm there to take care of him when the need arises. Why are you scared? Smile. God's offerings in this temple are simply delicious. Lord, the Lemon Rice looks tempting. I'm a family man. Serve me some more. Divya, you know something? Yesterday after seeing you with Kartik, mom and dad I felt that you are a perfect family girl. I'm a dirty, rotten scoundrel. But you are not like me. Why don't you find a good guy and marry him? My mom was an award winning Kuchipudi dancer. She was a gold-medalist in rifle-shooting too. You can't guess that when you look at her, right? She left all her hobbies and interests after marriage. She changed into a woman that my father likes. She feels that is love and that is how a marriage should be. My mom left everything for my dad and she views him as her whole world but my dad talks to her only when it is necessary and gives her money to manage the house. She stands at the table and serves him food each day. But he never asks if she has eaten or serves her food. My mom is just another thing that he gave his name to and brought home after the wedding. If this is what marriage is all about I'd prefer not to get married. It is not necessary that every man is like him, Divya. You might find a man who is very understanding. That's what my mom thought when she got married. Anything is possible if we put our mind to it, Divya. I will talk to my close friend Shiva Kumar and ask him to find a good man for you. - Shiva Kumar? Shiva Kumar! Lord Shiva! Hey, Shiva! Divya!- Divya! Shiva! It is your duty to find a good man like me for her. I know you won't find a man like me. He doesn't exist. But try to find someone like me. What do you say? The truth. The bell rang. Shourya! - Yes, dad? It is time for the prayer. Come up. - Okay. 'Chants' 'Chants' 'Chants' 'Chants' 'Chants' 'Chants' He packs her lunch box and writes a cute message on it. Did you see the glow in her face after marriage? Don't look at me like that. I'm a handsome man. You'll have a problem if you fall in love with me. But Soumya's office is in Ameerpet. What is she doing in this studio? Her company's product's ad shoot is going on. Wow, an ad shoot? I'm sure there will be models there. That's why I love you. Why is he here? - We came in his car Sister! - Hey! What's wrong? Who is the beauty shining in a Kala Mandir sari, sister? Model Vaidehi. She is from the US. Why do you want to know? What will a serpent say if you ask it why it wants to know about pigeons? What? Won't you introduce us? - Go find some work. Do you see that guy? His name is Shourya. He is a big flirt. In five years time he called me sister for the first time because he wanted me to introduce you. He is a total rascal. Be careful. I'll text his number to you. He will definitely call you. Don't answer it. Okay? The concept of love at first sight is true. She looked at me with so much love. Abhay! Shall we go? - Yes. What was her response, sister? You will get a call. Spray perfume and be ready. Not a call, I got a love letter. Hi! This is Vaidehi. What about 'Coffee' tomorrow? I love you so much, sister. - Hey. -No. I love you, Abhay! - Hey! Oh God! I can only see stones and rocks everywhere. But the address says this place. Is the map wrong or the girl wrong? Hey, Shourya! Shourya! Up here! Come on! Come on! Oh God! Wild is good but this is too wild. 'Coffee' on the rocks! Come on! Come on, let's move it. - I'm coming. Hold it. Keep your legs straight. Yes, that's right. Hi! I'm Vaidehi from Chicago. Hi! Shourya! I'm sure you've had 'Coffees' with many girls. I thought, this has to be something different. Am I right or wrong? You are so beautiful that even if you say wrong it feels right. Do you always flirt like this? Not always. Every Friday. And today is Friday so I have no choice. Shourya, 'Coffee.' Thanks. Soumya said that you are a bit dangerous. But you are very dangerous. But still you called me for a date. I like people who do what they want without any fear. I can't hide what I truly feel inside my heart. I'm clear. I don't have time for commitments and emotional dramas right now. I want to travel the whole world. I want to have photography exhibitions in London, Paris and Rome. I just want to enjoy my life, man. Hey, where did I see you? I think we met somewhere. What? Where? In the mirror. You are my mirror image. It feels so good to hear my ideas from a girl's lips. That's why I met you. This is the first and last time. Don't call me for dinner and take me to a desert. Okay? Should I call him or not? We are friends. We can call each other. It's okay. Shourya, look at this t-shirt. Cute, no? I think we should buy it. I like it if you like it. Three, four. Kamakshi, the snake bit you. Your game is finished. I won! Yes! Looks like your boyfriend is very busy. He didn't have time to answer my calls the whole day. He will be very tired when he comes home. Shall we make dinner to give him a surprise? Hmm. What should I cook? 'Biryani' (rice cooked with meat)? Oh dear! I was thinking of making 'Veg Biryani'. Don't give me that look. You have such a dirty mind, Kamakshi. Seriously. I've a dirty mind? What did I say? You said that I'm your mirror reflection, so Huh? You have a dirty mind. Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Stop! Divya, I'm sorry. I spent the whole day with a friend. I couldn't take your calls. I hope it wasn't urgent. You would've texted me if it was urgent. Right? Oh God! Why are you doing this dangerous breathing? If you do some beautiful yoga poses my heart rate will increase and I can burn calories too. Okay, okay. Stop behaving like an idiot, Shourya. I got it. Today is a holiday. I'll make lunch for us. Followed by caroms. Okay? No other plans. No phones. Nothing. Hmm? Hey, Vaidu! You will live for 100 years. I was just thinking about you. Huh? Hello! I didn't get you. ‘Hello? Yes, Byju. Good. Tell me.’ She filled it with dresses. Why will I be busy? Tell me where you want to go. Watch a movie? Anything is okay. Sister, the snake bit you. The whole town is filled with snakes. Sister, why do you both have two separate rooms? We don't do that in our home. Go ask uncle about it. The t-shirt you selected is very good. - Uncle! You selected me - Hi, Pepsi! Uncle, why do you and Aunt sleep in separate bedrooms? We don't do that in our home. You are a Punjabi family. We are a Telugu family. This is how we sleep. Go. Go and play. I'm coming in a minute. Sister, I want to pee. Shourya will take you. Go to him. We will have a great time in New York. Okay? I want to pee urgently. Go home and pee. It is coming. I want to do it right now. Divya! Divya! Help him. Uncle, it's urgent. Urgent. You drink everything you see and pee a hundred times. What is this? Darn! Oh I see. I know who he is talking to. How do you know? He posted a thousand selfies with a new girl on Facebook. Didn't you see them? Please. I don't care. I don't have the time or the interest to see his Facebook account. Darling! Where were you? Since today was a holiday I made your favorite 'Egg Fried Rice.' I've to show you something first. Where have you been for the past two days? I hardly see you. Darling! Darling! Wait. See this, darling. Sexy body. Vaidehi. Superb personality. If you see her and tell me to proceed I'll take my romance to the next level. Hey! Remove your hand. You've been calling me darling and baby. Am I your girlfriend? Am I your wife? Don't try to handle me like you handle the others. Hey, what did I say now? Don't touch me. I hate it when a cheap guy like you touches me. What? I'm a cheap guy? Don't talk rubbish because I'm being nice. Do you think you are Katrina Kaif or Sunny Leone so that I'll get tempted and fall on you? Ant bitten lips and eyes the size of one rupee coins. You don't reach my shoulder when you stand straight. But you think you are a sexy woman. Men are dying waiting in a queue for you. Bland face with crazy hair! This is how a woman should look. She has a hot figure. First of all, you are not my type. She is my type. Even a dead man will get up and start dancing after looking at her. But if someone sees you at night he will die of a heart attack. Got it? Now bang the door! Hmm. She is crazy. How can he say that to me? Of course, I'm not Katrina Kaif. But I'm above average. I'm the best looking girl in our group, aren't I? In intermediate college, didn't Venkatesh follow me for three months? He humiliated me so badly. Stupid basket! How dare that monkey face comment about me? He will pay for it. He is dead. I'll teach him a lesson. And she's some bimbo called Vaidehi. Looks like a c-grade item girl. How dare he shows her face and insults me? I won't be called Vaidehi if I don't bury him alive. Darn! I won't be called Divya. Okay, bye. Hmm. Kamakshi! Kamakshi! I gave you your notes. Kamakshi! Ramulu! - 'Yes, sir?' Did you see Kamakshi in the building? 'No, sir. I didn't see it here.' You know me, Hima. -'Hmm.' He messed with me, so he is dead. I will make his life miserable. 'Are we going to the movie or not?' Lunch? I made tasty 'Chicken fry.' Fresh 'Chicken' tastes so yum. 'What did I ask you and what are you talking about?' 'Chicken legs' are my favorite. It smells sexy. 'I think you've gone deaf. I'm hanging up. Bye.' Why would Divya eat Kamakshi? Have you gone mad? Girls will do anything if they get angry. We are talking about Divya here. Did you forget that Sumo incident? But what did you do to make her so angry? Actually we had a small fight. Why? I got irritated when she said stupid things to me. What's wrong in what I said? I just spoke the truth. You should never tell the truth to girls when it comes to height, weight and beauty. You should say things that sound like the truth but never the truth. Always remember that. Alright. What do I do now? Do one thing. The face that you are making now yes, that face. Maintain the same expression and say I'm very sorry in a sweet and sincere way. At least act sincere while saying it. He is so worried about you. He searched the whole house for you. You are better than me. You don't have to be so happy. This is temporary too. Once that Vaidehi enters the house, you will be finished. I found Kamakshi, darling. It crept into a carton under my bed. Stupid bird. She had me so worried. Oh God! Of course, baby. How can I forget your birthday? I booked a beautiful candle light dinner in Taj Krishna. So get ready for a beautiful, super romantic birthday. We'll have lots of fun. What do you say? Be ready, darling. I will come to pick you up. I love you, Shourya. - Huh! I really didn't have these feelings until I met you. But you and your words I'm just so happy with you. I don't know when I fell into this process. Did you expect that I'll say something like that? That will never happen. Vaidehi! Mirror image of Shourya. Thank God! You are the only one that gave me such a big shock for the first time in my life. Good. Very good. With me, you will experience a new thrill every day and a new shock every hour. - Shourya. Hmm? Divya! What are you doing here? Vaidehi, Divya! Divya, Vaidehi! - Hello! Hi! - Who is she? Cousin. Yeah, my cousin. Sit down, Divya. This table won't be enough. - Why? We are three of us and there are four chairs. What about them? - Who? Hi! Hi, Shourya uncle! Any problem? Yeah. No. Absolutely no problem. No. Not yet. Who are they? Friends. No, they are more than that. Almost family. How can your family be Punjabis? This is interstate marriage like inter-cast marriage. How interesting! Right? - How? How - Tell her, Shourya. We'll tell her after we come back, Divya. One minute. - Yeah, sure. Come with me. What is this nuisance? - We heard that it is Divya's birthday today. Why didn't you tell us before, Shourya? She suddenly invited us for dinner. We couldn't bring her a gift. Your coming is like a gift for Shourya, uncle. Who is that girl? A friend. - Divya's friend? No, she's a cousin, Aunt. Divya's cousin? - Yeah. No, Shourya's cousin. Yeah, cousin. - Cousin sister? You don't have sisters, right? There's Vaidehi, Divya. Shall we go? Mummy, 'Juice'! - Hello, Aunt! Hello! - She is very cute, son. Uncle! You know Shourya's family very well, right? Of course, dear. We were their neighbors for 15 years. Their family is like my family. Then tell uncle how Vaidehi is related to you, Shourya. I'm sure uncle knows her parents. Yes. Tell me, son. My dad's cousin brother Srinivasa Rao. I met him in Bangalore recently. So it is not him. My mom's younger brother - Ramu! Ramu uncle's daughter - Ramu doesn't have children. Right. But Ramu's older brother has. But your dad said that they are still kids. He said that? I'm sure he did. Then he must be right. Okay. I still didn't understand how she is your cousin. I just told you. - No, you didn't. I didn't? You know my dad's family and my mom's family? I know. - Hmm? And my Aunt in Pune? - I don't know her. Yes! She is her daughter. So what is this Pune girl doing here? She is studying here. But she told me she is a model. She is studying modeling. How can anyone study modeling?-She is modeling while studying, uncle. Studying modeling. Aunt, are you a model? Yes. Didn't Shourya tell you? No, he didn't. He didn't even tell me that you are coming. He didn't tell me too. He didn't tell us anything as well until we came here. Shourya! Where is the birthday 'Cake'? Did you tell them that it is my birthday? What? Today is your birthday too? Yours too? - Yes. Wow, Shourya! So exciting! Yes, it is too much. He didn't tell me about you so how will he tell me about your birthday? Happy birthday, Divya! - Thank you. Same to you. You are welcome. - 'Divya, please do something. Save me.' 'How, Shourya? I have eyes the size of one rupee coins' 'and a pea-sized brain. How can I help you? 'I'm sorry, really sorry. I will never be rude to you again.' 'After seeing my bland face and crazy hair' 'even a healthy man will die. So, what can I do?' 'You look like an angel. You look like' 'a heady mix of Miss World and Miss Universe.' 'Please ignore everything I said.' 'I said that because I didn't want to be tempted, darling.' 'Hmm. I don't think you are saying that wholeheartedly.' 'Please. Please, I will touch your feet.' 'Okay, go ahead.' 'What? Me? No way.' Shourya, did you tell them about the marriage? Marriage? - Whose marriage? Hmm? I found the spoon. Okay? Happy now? Shall we cut the 'Cake'? Happy birthday to you! Let's cut it together. -Happy birthday to you! The older ones first. Divya, I'm - Sorry. Me too. I spoke rubbish. I didn't mean all that. It is true that I irritated you. But what if Uncle Singh got suspicious after today and told dad about it? We both will be in a problem. I'm sorry. I'll never do that again. I behaved in a very foolish manner. I vented out my anger in a wrong way. I'm really sorry. PMS? What? I mean, monthly I know about it. Hello! Every mood swing that a girl has is not PMS. Stupid. Whatever the reason was, don't let it happen again. The mood is yours but the swings will come to me. It is very difficult to handle. Hmm. This is why I told you no. But you didn't listen to me. What? Are you totally in love with him? What are you talking about? Don't pretend before me. I don't know what you are thinking. Shourya and me are just friends. Did I say Shourya? You are saying that. Why do you get upset when anyone mentions Vaidehi? Why have you been so dull for the past four days? There are hundred reasons for my bad mood. None of those reasons are about Shourya. What we have between us is just a contract. Four documents and two signatures. We will get a divorce in a month. Finish. Looks like you are trying hard to convince yourself. Wish you all the best. Bye. Darling, honey, I know that you are busy. I will take 2 mins, But after yesterday's dinner episode I took a decision to avoid such confusions. That was to meet Vaidehi. I braced myself for whatever the consequences might be and told her the whole truth. At first she was shocked. After that she burst out laughing, you know. She said, I usually talk about breaking the rules and so on but what you both did is totally the next level. I even told her how you put me in trouble last night. She couldn't control laughing. She said, Divya is perfect to handle your crazy behavior. Anyway, Vaidu wants to meet you this evening. So 8 pm I'll pick you up. After that we all can party. What do you say? I will call you later. Bye. Hello? Hello, Divya? Shourya! Shourya! Get up! Shourya! Shourya! Shourya! Get up! Shourya? Shourya? Shourya! Shourya, get up! - Divya! Divya! What is this? What are you doing in Vaidehi's flat? She is in our flat, stupid. I thought I dropped her home. Did she drop me? No problem. Anything is fine. Good night, baby. Go to sleep. - Oh God! Shourya! What?- Mom and dad are here. Why did my parents come here? My parents are here, Shourya. Still switched off. The watchman said they were at home. I don't know. - What do I do? Darling, wake up. -Shourya! Let's hide her in the storeroom. Sorry. Sorry. Go open the door. Go. Were you still sleeping? We slept late last night, mom. I was at the hospital. Don't move. Divya, did you make 'Coffee'? Mom! Dad! What a surprise! When did you come? How are you, son? Divya takes good care of me. Mom, how is your health? It is good, son. That's right. Even diseases visit us for a few days and go back like guests. We came for a small check-up in the hospital. We will go back tomorrow. No, dad. I don't mind. I was just joking. This is your daughter's home. Excuse me. Yes, we reached. Mom, shall I make 'Coffee' for you. No, dear. I'll make breakfast for your dad. No, mom! Please sit. This is your first visit to our home. Please don't start cooking so soon. What is happening in our Vijayawada? Do you watch daily soaps? I don't watch daily soaps, son. Oh dear! There is one daily soap that is being aired. 'Fake Marriage.' I don't know if you watch it but my mom and I watch it regularly. What do you say, Divya? Do you know about it? No? Okay. Divya, I want to take bath. Divya, dad can use my room. Take mom to your room. There are two bedrooms because girls are every greedy for more space she filled all the cupboards with saris and dresses. Come with me, Dad. Hmm. Mom! Where are you going? Sit down. He had diabetes. I have to give him breakfast and give tablets before 9. I will make breakfast while he is taking a bath. Oh dear! You don't have to take that trouble. We have a good hotel right beside our house. They make good breakfast. I'll go bring it. He doesn't like outside food, son. Divya! Where is the storeroom? No, mom! Sorry, mom. I remembered my mom. It's been four months since I got married but she didn't come to visit me yet. She loves Kartik more than me. He is her world. Am I not her son? I have been hiding this pain from four months. But it came out after I saw you. Basically I look like a normal guy. But I'm too emotional. Am I right, Divya? 'My foot.' Mom, he will keep talking if you stand here. Come, take bath. I will make breakfast for dad. No, dear. Son in law is I know. Come with me. Come on. Wow, I managed the situation so beautifully. If you start a MBA college, you'll be the king there. What a talent! You are a smart guy! Stop this extra drama and throw her out before they come out. How can I do that when she is in that condition? I don't care. You have your useless friends. Call them. Useless friend Abhay! Singh uncle is father in law's friend. This is his son Candy. They live in the adjacent flat. Get up. Get up. Do you have 'Chicken's' in your home too? We have many. What do you eat? Uncle, are you Telugu or Punjabi? Telugu. Oh God! ‘Do you have lots of bedrooms in your house too?’ ‘You’ Do you sleep in two bedrooms? Like Shourya uncle You came? He comes here at this time every day to pee. This is the fashion for kids nowadays. Shall we go? Bad manners. You should pee in your own house. Go. Yes. Now go. He did his job. - Shourya! It is amazing to have 'Coffee' here every morning. This is a telescope, isn't it? Yes, dad. I love astronomy. Please try it. It is superb. I can't see anything. Turn it that side. Divya, is the breakfast ready? Yes. Dad, turn it that side. You will see Birla Mandir. Where, son? I can't see anything. Turn Right. Turn right. More right. Exactly 22 degrees. There! - Where? Don't turn this way. Look that way. Someone is at the door. The sun will come up in five minutes. You won't be able to see the God. Keep looking. I will open the door. Shourya! Shourya! Abhay! - What happened? Why did you call me urgently? Come in. Come in. Shourya! - Thank you so much. What is she doing here? - Hey, baby! How was your night? Save me. - Long night. Try to understand. Save me. Divya! I don't think the temple is this side. Son! Vaidu, my friend Abhay. Why did you close the door like that? I was actually going to open that door. Take her away. Please take her away. We are caught. Dad! Mom! Abhay! Abhay! Mom! Dad! Divya! Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Divya! You met them. Okay? Done? Bye! - Who is this new girl? Hello, everybody! You can meet them later. Come for dinner. Who are you sending me with? - Bye! Love you. Take care. I beg of you. Drop her at home. Oh God! Oh God! Why did you send them away? - They talk too much, mom. They are like Fevicol. They will get stuck here. They will not leave at all. We have a lot of work. Am I right, Divya? Shourya! Dad! Dinner ready. Dad! - Yes? - Just wait. What did you say? What did I say? Should I come and eat as soon as you call me? Should I sit when you say, Shourya sit or stand and wait for your orders? What happened now? Why do ladies dominate us like this, dad? You pampered her too much. What will be left of our honor if you cook and serve daily? Answer me. We have small desires and tastes of our own. Tell her, dad. What should I say, son? Why be scared, dad? Let's say it bravely and openly. I'm here with you. Look, I'm not a good person like you all to sit and eat whenever you ask me to. All the rules will be changed from today. We both will serve you food and you two have to eat. Hmm? Come, dad. Mom, sit down. Divya, sit. Sit. Dad, don't be scared. Serve food to mom. Do it, dad. Hmm. Don't stop even if she says no. Serve the food. Eat. Hmm? Enough, son. Eat this poppadum. We got confused after seeing his confusion. In my whole life This is the first time I've seen him laughing like this in 25 years of our marriage. God granted you a husband who is 100 times better than the one I wanted for you. Good entertainment for the whole family. Listen, I packed everything. You said we'll leave by 9. Is it 9 already? Oh, I didn't realize it. Ask son in law about Divya I forgot. Next month we have Divya's cousin's wedding in Vijayawada. Since she has holidays now we will take her along so that she can meet everyone. Sure. Divya is your daughter. You can take her whenever you want. Okay, Divya? Go and have a good time. I will call you once I reach. Divya, did you tell uncle that we will reach by 1? Yes, I told him. Did we keep everything? Divya, the bottles What bottles? I mean I asked if you kept water bottles in the car. Yes, I kept them. 'Thank God she kept them.' Shall we go? - See you later, son. Okay, dad. Divya! Yes? What? I didn't find the 'Beer' bottles. Where did you hide them? In the bathroom cabinet. Darling, that is a superb idea. That's why I love you. Be happy and enjoy yourself. Divya, call me once you reach. Mom, send her soon. I can't do without her. Bye, Divya. - Okay. Bye, darling! Yes! Don't put the 'Juice' bottle in your mouth directly. Pour it in a glass and drink it like a human being. Your Aunt should've been a teacher, not a doctor. All her anger is just for show, she is soft inside. She acts like Gabbar Singh before everyone but she becomes a lamb in front of her dad. I know what you are thinking. No, no, no, I'm not missing Divya. I don't have diseases like emotional attachments and missing people. I will never have them. I just got used to her. That's it. It's a habit. Habits come and go. That's it. Cheers! Cheers! - Woohoo! After a month, you guys will miss me very much. I wonder how you will live. How? How do you guys bear him? When you have a big gutter flowing beside your house you slowly get used to the stink. It's the same with him. Right. Crap! Call from US. Hello? Yeah, John. What? That's That's awesome news. Thank you. Yeah, I'll be there. Sure. Thank you. Yes! Hello, New York! What? It's a million dollar contract. What superb news! Wait, Divya will be so happy when I tell her this. I like this. - Where did you go? - Send me, okay? Boys, one more. - Yeah. What happened? Everything okay? Why are you tense? Nothing. My US contract has been approved. What? - Wow! The US contract has been approved? - Hmm. Why are you saying it so casually? Celebration! Woohoo! Whoa! Bro, I'm happy for you. Okay, calm down. - Celebrations! Divya Calling Divya? Yeah. She told me two days back that I'll get confirmation this month. Did you call your parents? - No, I'll call them later. Divya should've reached Vijayawada by now. Why is her phone not reachable? So, you didn't share this big news with your parents first. You didn't share it with your close friends. You didn't tell me. When you wanted to share the good news that you have been waiting to hear for so long the first person you thought about was Divya. Find out what's in your heart, Shourya. I feel it is time for you to think. Take care. Bye. Hello! What? Are you okay? Sister! She’s no more. She died with a satisfied heart. She saw your wedding. She met Divya who loves us all so much. She died in peace. I never thought that you will become so mature. It is all because of Divya. You rejected the proposal at first but accepted it later. That's destiny. Very few men are so lucky in life. Don't lose it. Dad! Brother! What's wrong? What's wrong? See what they are showing on TV since an hour. There was a time when they used to celebrate when a wedding was fixed. But now they are celebrating the breaking of a marriage and the taking of a divorce. Brain Halls from Australia has posted a video on Facebook about an Indian couple and it has gone viral on internet. Celebrating our divorce, my friend. This is the latest fashion in India. She is my wife. Oh sorry, my ex-wife Divya. And he is my XYZ Shourya. Serves them right for asking us to get married. We have to get married and give birth to children. Which convent is your child studying in? How much fees did you pay? Will they give discounts if you have Aadhar Card? They want us to live in slow motion with all such rubbish. Dad, actually I will kill you. I will kill you if you say another word. Do we look like fools to you? Who gave you the right to disgrace us publicly? Who gave you the right? You'll get married for us and separate for yourselves? After that? Who will you live for after that? Who will you live with? On the wedding invitations we print your names along with parents' names and addresses and also the best wishes of all the relatives in the end. Do you what that means? Our families are following the tradition of marriage trusting that our children will respect it. So, please come and shower them with your blessings. Give them place as a wedded couple in the society. They will continue to uphold our honor and reputation. This is what it means. But what did you do? You didn't get married to do us a favor. You did it to give meaning to your own lives. If everybody starts thinking like you marriage will become a ghost very soon. Today I lost everything that I earned in the past 45 years of my life. My daughter is equally to be blamed for this. That's why I'm sparing you. The divorce is granted. Here are the divorce papers. Your daughter will get married in Hyderabad next week. I heard that you decided to go to US. Mom told me. All the best. I didn't want to hurt anyone, dad. I'm telling the truth. But this is my fault. I'm responsible for this. At least half of the mistakes we do in life are not done to hurt others, Shourya. We just do what we feel is right in that moment. We don't have the desire or the discernment to understand what that will result in. The marriage may have been a lie to you. But the time that you both have spent together is true. The love and affection that you shared with our families is true. The friendship between you and Divya is true. It is true that you are in love with her. You don't have to tell me, I can see it in your eyes. You feel that marriage is a burdensome responsibility. Do you know what you need to understand? Friendship is more important in a marriage than love and responsibility. Anything can change but not friendship. Friendship is what you both have achieved by rejection your marriage. Anyway, good luck, son. Will your problems be solved if you leave everyone and run away to US? Can you forget Divya? Her wedding is happening in Hyderabad today. Think about it for a second. If you talk to Divya once, I'm sure What should I say to her? How should I face Divya? Tell me. I will go. Divya, please trust me again. Come, let's elope. Is that what I should say? I constantly asked Divya to trust me but I ruined her life with my stupid ideas. I hurt my parents, Divya's parents and everyone else. I didn't listen to anyone. I didn't think at all. I just did what I wanted to. No more. It is right for me to leave. Stop near the ATM. - Okay, sir. Sorry, sir. Out of service. There's another ATM on the third floor. Who are you? Give me your phone. - One minute. Do you know what is happening? How did I come here? Hey! The gun is in my hand. Why are you asking the questions? Didn't you study science? Brother, you are cute. Don't be scared of the gun. I'm not a villain. I'm a real gentleman. She will get married again. Do you know that? How does he know that Divya is getting married again? You also know? Does that mean that she tells it to everyone? That's why I'm leaving for US. Huh? Why are you going away to US when my wife is getting married? Your wife? - Your wife? Oh God! Not now. We are divorced. My wife divorced you too? Why will your wife divorce me? My wife divorced me. I mean our Brother, don't confuse me. Clarity. Our wife - What our wife? I will miss my flight. You will just miss a flight. I'm going to die. I'm here to commit suicide. Suicide? - Yes. Our wife divorced you without divorcing me and now she is marrying another man. Let's commit suicide together. Let's tell our family story to this world and die. You kill me and I will kill you. But we have only one gun. How? - Brother, you are very confused. No, you are confused. She ditched both of us, brother. Brother, don't talk about Divya like that. Why will Divya marry you? Who is Divya? My wife is marrying another man. Similarly, your wife is marrying another man too. Is that it? - Is your wife getting married to the same man? She is marrying someone else. And you are still alive? - What else should I do? Shame on you. Let's jump down and die. I forgot an important thing. Make a call urgently. Call who? - The media. The media will tell the whole world and my wife about our suicide. Brother, I have had a few drinks. Nobody will believe me, so I brought you here. Come on, call up the media urgently. How can you do that? What should I do now? Wait, hold the line. I will tell you. Hello! - Hello! Is it N TV? Yes, tell me. - Sir, there's a man here. It seems his wife is marrying someone else. He came here to commit suicide. He unnecessarily kidnapped me and brought me here. The gun. - He has a gun too, sir. Suicide? What is his name? What is your name? - Gautam, software. His name is Gautam, sir. - What is your name? Sir, my name is Shourya. Area? At Madhapur, sir. On the terrace of Teja Towers. Naveen! - Yes, sir? Suicide case. Go get a live covering. - Okay, sir. Got it? - Sir. I will kill you if you ask stupid doubts. Write it down. Fresh news! A software engineer called Shourya is committing suicide. We heard that he kidnapped another software engineer named Gautam at gunpoint. We still don't know what his demands are. Nobody listened to me when I said we'll go to the airport. Now call Divya. Hello! - Shourya is committing suicide. He climbed a building to commit suicide because you are getting married again. What? Leave immediately and come here. Please ask him to stop these dramas and plots. You mental girl! It is coming live on TV. Watch it. I don't care. Please leave me alone. Oh God! Take us to the Registrar's office. Hello! - Hello, sir! How are you? I'm fine. - Is Mr. Rao inside? - Yes. Divya! Shourya is really committing suicide for you. Please trust me. Honestly. Don't think about it, Divya. We don't have the heart to give you that freedom. We can never agree that a girl knows everything even if she is a grown up. We've the courage to point out your mistakes but we don't have the courage to accept our own. So I'm making this decision for you. Go. I have total confidence in the way I raised you. You will see me dead if you climb another step. Go. Go. Come on, quick. Get in quickly. - Come on, let's go. Hello, Suman! Can you hear me? Hello! How long will it take for the extra force to come in? Shourya! It is becoming difficult to control the crowd. - Stop it! Quick! Send them quickly, sir! Shourya! - Okay, sir. Shourya! - Come fast. Shourya! Shourya! Who are you? - Sir, I'm Divya. What? - Shourya is committing suicide for me. Shourya? Hello? - Hello! I'm the SI. I'm speaking from downstairs. - Shourya! Your wife is here. - Shourya! It seems your wife is here. - Oh, yes. Talk to her. Here, talk to him. - Hello! Hello? - Are you mad? Yes, I'm mental, I'm crazy. Any man will become crazy after marrying you he won't become a scientist. Are you drunk? I'm drunk. I will drink until I die. Please come down. There is no chance of that happening. Shourya, no! Go ahead and get married. Just remember that I'm dying for you. Listen to me. I didn't get married. Come down. - I already decided. The media, the audience and brother will be disappointed if I don't commit suicide, you know. Please I have to talk to you, Shourya. Shourya? Oh, brother. Sir, please talk to him. Your sister in law wants to talk to you give me if she takes my name again. - Hello? Will you commit suicide even after your wife begged you not to? Sir, I'm not committing suicide. It is the other man. Yes, me. Why did you take the phone? Give it to him. He wants to talk to you. Hello? - Your wife is crying here. Sir, I believed her tears and got married to her and I'm still crying because of that decision. Oh God! He is not listening to me. You convince him. Hello! - What hello? I've had enough. Go. Listen to me please. My wedding. Go and marry that buffoon. Did you see my situation, brother? Goodbye. Shourya He cut the call, sir. Go to the terrace of the adjacent building. Maybe he will change his mind after seeing you. Stand back. Stand back. Okay, brother. My job is done. I'm going. Hey! You can't go down until I go up. Okay, I will die right now. - Stop. Why do you love me so much? I'm going to die anyway. Use my credit cards and my money. Spend it all. Shourya! Shourya! You don't have to pay the interest. Divya, what are you doing here? Will you kill yourself if I marry another man? Are you mad? No, I'm not dying. He is killing himself. Yes, me. - What? Gautam, software. Why did you say that on the phone? Oh! Was it you on the phone? Wasn't it Saroja on the phone? - Gautam. Software, it's me. - What is this confusion? His wife is marrying someone else like you. That's why he came here to commit suicide. I was leaving for US but he kidnapped me on the way. But you thought I was going to die. That's it. Were you running to US because I was getting married? I mean - You! What is she searching for, brother? Oh no, a stone. The gap is too much to jump there. Otherwise I would've come there to push you. What did I do? He is better than you. He is committing suicide because his wife is marrying someone else. But you just scolded him for trying to commit suicide. Why are you supporting him now? That's how ladies are, brother. They get confused and confuse us too. Divya! - What? I came to a decision. You regret marrying this buffoon. And I regret marrying that useless woman. Same situation. Same feel. Same love. Same climax. Let's ditch both of them and we both can get married if you say okay. What do you say? Hey! I will smash your head. Why will you beat him up? Wow! Divya darling is already supporting me. Nobody knows when and where love starts. I will stab you in the ribs if you call this love. Reverse again. Did you see that, brother? We can't trust women. Come, let's die. Wait a minute. I need to talk to Divya. I'll be happy if I can convince her or we both can die together. You can never convince me with your words. It was a big mistake to enter your life. Correct. Why did you enter my life? You ruined my life. I hate you, Divya. I was happy until now. 24 years. I had innumerable friends. Meet, eat, drink and finish. I didn't care much about anybody. I didn't care if someone was with me or not. I wanted to be like that with you too. But I couldn't do that. Why? That's why I hate you. Anju and Abhay have been my friends from childhood. I used to share everything with them first. But now? I want to share everything with you first. Why? Are you that important to me? That's why I hate you. When your dad was dragging you away that day I was worried about you, not about myself. I was sick with worry that they will scold you. Till now I thought I knew what I wanted in life, Divya. But after you left I realized that I know nothing. That's why I hate you. I hate you too. I love you! Yes! Shourya! Shourya, come down. Shourya, please. - I was born for a reason. Shourya! - I was alive till now so that I can unite you. Now I will die. This is enough, brother. Listen to me. Come down.- Give me your phone. Give me your phone. Last picture, brother. Shourya, careful. - I just want to take a selfie. -Shourya! Brother, post this on Facebook. Saroja should see it. He is going to jump. He is going to jump. Come down, brother. You board your flight. I will board my flight. Shourya! I won't come. Shourya! Shourya! - Shourya! Shourya, please! Shourya! Kapileshwaramma! You are the one that pulled the zip without checking if our son had his underwear on or no. What can I do from here if you call me now? Please don't torture me. Don't you have anything else to talk about on phone other than how to wash his bum or pull his zipper? Your stupid torture has turned me into a stupid truck driver from a professional killer. Shourya! Shourya! They say a person sees his whole life before his eyes just before his death. Hey, move aside! I killed someone. Finished. Kapileshwaramma, you pulled the zip on our son now the police will pull the trigger on me. Because of your phone torture I lost control over the truck and rammed into someone. What did I do to deserve this? Shourya! Are you okay? Sir! I didn't kill him on purpose. Kapileshwaramma pulled our son's zipper up without seeing if he had his underwear on or no. Listen to me, sir. You didn't kill anyone. In fact, you saved someone, sir. You are a real hero. Hero? - Yes, sir. What did you say? I'm a hero? Congratulations. Sir, she tortured me on the phone. Get down. Are you okay? - Are you hurt? - Hey, are you okay? Shourya! - We all were so worried. Why did you do this?- Shourya! Yay! Time for celebration! Divya! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
