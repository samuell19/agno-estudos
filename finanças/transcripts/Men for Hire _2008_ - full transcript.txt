and AMP POLSKA PRESENT a film by EDWARD POREMBNY MEN FOR HIRE Hello, hi Joasia, my dear, how've you been? Me? Well, ok. I've been thinking about that wedding. You know, I need someone to go with to the wedding,somebody I can dance with, talk to, nice, charming, delightful. I don't know what to do with it,you know, it's like? Good morning Hi Hello - I don't know if you remember my - neighbour, - Ola, the one with black hair, she was at my birthday party Hmmm... Her sister had a problem similar to yours hmmm? - And fancy that she hired a guy. Hired a guy? - - Yeah, there are men like that, - I think she found him on the Internet, I don't know if someone recommended him. ?but do you know anything else about it? It's a guy who you pay to spend some time with you,maybe at a family gathering. It's not like there is an implication of sex,it's a man that... - it's just a job for him. - You pay him to keep you company. A companion, like, lets say geisha? Yes, just like that. You can have a conversation and dance, they're probably the kind of guyswho would include dancing in the package. I wonder what type of a man does that kind of work. You know, it might be just an average guywho doesn't necessarily want to go to bed with you, or feel you up or touch you. He simply goes to work. My father also works nights,only he's a driver. Oh yes, that's a slightly different kind of work. Yeah, but he could just as well pull overbecause a girl is available, right? Are you busy? You have no time to... to meet other people? Are you a successful woman making a career,but your social life is non-existent? - Call me, drop me a line, lets meet. - The price subject to negotiation. I am a student at the University of Physical Education. I'd like to do something connected with sport,open my own gym, a health centre. It would have a SPA, massages,beauty treatment, a physician. When it comes to a general goal in life,don't rush into it. It is the most important thing,and not rushing all the time, running and pursuing money. Women are more and more emancipationist,they value their own time more, they're independent, want to develop and have a career. I think that women want that kind of freedom. They become stronger, more and more independent, they hold executive positions in big companies,and that used to be very rare. On the other hand, men become weaker. Therefore a strong woman doesn'twant to be with a weak man, he wouldn't be a compatible partner for her. Badboys group, how can I help you? Hi Krystian. OK? For tonight, right? No, tonight we are in Wrocław. So I don't have anyone here who I could send. Lie down sweetheart, lie down. I've really changed, I've changed a - lot. - I used to feel sorry for myself, have a cry, how ill I am, right? Now it's different. My Dawid said that I was very closeto becoming an ignorant, spiteful old hag. Up to a point Dawid had contact with his father. Even though we're divorced, I used to take Dawid for every holidayto see him, until he could go by himself. One moment please. Badboys Group, how can I help you? Women understand that the Badboys erotic danceris of a very high standard, he is well mannered and well educated. I have a dual degree and I'm very happy with it, everyone says I am a double engineer. When we showed our faces, described ourselves,gave detailed descriptions... we gave all our details, schools we graduated from,we didn't hide anything. And then women started to trust us, fully. Walking in the city, doing my everyday things, going to the post-office, I meet a girl who was at a bachelorette party where I worked. I go anywhere, to shops, the gym. Everywhere I see women who have been to a show. In a country such as Poland, a backwater country, very Catholic, some things seem prudish,the whole country is prudish. Our profession is a thing that, you know... It's awful how these man can take - their cloths off? - What are they doing? They are simply male hookers;some people think that. - Say, how are our boys - going? - How are our Badboys? Everything's OK. OK? That's good. Yeah, they've been to Latvia and Lithuania,now we have a big event coming up, - on the seventeenth of October, - Badboys group will give a show. There will also be erotic dancerswho teach erotic dance at hens nights. Excellent, I'd love to come to a night like that. Oh, yeah. How are you going? I'm doing just fine. That's great, it's the most important! And I will have a poppy seed cake, please. I say Dawid, someone's got really nice shoes,and boom - here comes a package with shoes with sheepskin on the outside, funny looking. I say Where am I suppose to go wearing shoes like that? Mum, you're the manager of Badboys, so you really should wear shoes like that. You see, would you have said a few years ago that I would be doing what I'm doing now? It's an outrage, what are you doing girl,erotic dancing? It used to be like that. But if I like it, I don't care what other people say, like Ewa, this or that, you know. I like it and I want to do it, it's interesting. I was in my fifties, yeah, I was 56. And then I started a job with Badboys, who'd have thought it? Maybe you'll get together with an older Badboy? No, I don't want to. You don't want to? No, I don't want to, I've got my Badboys and that's enough for me... sometimes they come to the office,have a chat with me. Each one more attractive and charmingthan the last one, and me, the only woman among so many guys. I love the movement, I need it, I need adrenaline, I like to have fun and .... I'm a man, I love women and in this kind work... maybe rather a job, right? It gives me everything I need, satisfaction. 200 women, right? 300, in front of the stage. They all want me, right? Only waiting what I'm gonna doand how I'm gonna do it. It boosts your self-esteem. The funny thing is that my friend,it's his stag night. He's 25 and never.... He just said that he won't do ituntil the wedding night. He's shy, he needs applause. He©s beginning to be afraid of her. Remember, he's a virgin! The lion may wake up too early... All girls move their bodies! Male companion for banquets, travel,weddings, receptions, celebrations. Ok.. There are many kinds of events. You don't have to go alone or give up the pleasure just becauseyou have no-one to go with. He can make you experience many happymoments,enjoy excellent company. Sensitive to women's needs. OK. I found your advertisement and decided to write to you. Patryk? Hello, its Rafał. Listen, I found your advert on the Internet and... Sorry? Sorry, you're breaking up. Can you hear me? Hello? Patryk, I'm calling with a - question. - Could you possibly help me? Patryk? Hi, it's Rafał. Hello? Can we address one another by first names?it will make it easier... Sure, sure. - - Like I said on the phone, - I'd like to do something similar and... if you could tell me something - about it, - I'd be really grateful. Or at least tell me what not to do. What you should do, is probablyplace an advert on the Internet. Hmmm - - on some dating sites, or classifieds. - And go to parties. Appear at .... Parties? In clubs? Exactly. It's just that some guys go there, some women.... Older women go there, they likestrong guys with.... you know. but you get different offers, sex as well? Or going to a banquet, wedding, party or a ... I don't know, don't know what to tell you. Of course, you always have tostand by your own values, right? And don't get too involved, keep your distance. Yeah, keep a distance from it all. Here you go. Fine, thanks. 120, right? OK Great And I thought? something is going on? right, but how many inquiries we got. 125 000 !!! good Have a look at bachelorette parties? intimate meetings, romantic dinners, ecstatic nights. no, it won't be a dream? any trick?fantasy no?no - trips of some prostitutes, no, - no, - I don't want to do it. Go on. love triangles and? no, that's out. rings?! Different sizes And an interesting range... did you hear me? Interesting range. Like a grocery store! Ok, let's do it again, go down Ewa Wżyła, she goes to a beautician... yeah? she exercises, swims? and how she looks, damn it. and when she wants it, there are other pleasures. Then there would be gossip. Oh, listen, that guy has work all the time,because now she has to continue and hire him all the time, always the same guy. You know, I don't know if she is so happyto always get the same one... but what a great idea. Kinga is really ok. But she didn't tell me how much she was paying for it. What's the cost? But its always a solution. You don't have anyone to go to a New Year's Eve party with, so you hire a guy... or go outto the movies or the theatre with him. Life starts after forty, after fifty. Go down, wait, here. 100% submissive male. Nooo Hot 20? Hot 23-year-old for any girl. The rest is not for us We don't fit any standard..! But today we'll go out and have some fun. We're set. Ok, so we going out honey... which five, you haven't learned a five yet. A girl asks her friend Have you got a male companion yet? Complete nonsense. Do you have a gigolo, or an escort. Or ASSGUARD. My assguard, yeah? Assguard is a good term for it. I'd like to see a school for men, Men for Hire or assguard... University Of Assguards, etc. They would learn dancing,family conversations, dress, perfume, basic knowledge of shops in the city,good ones, better ones, average ones. Getting up, serving, holding the door. After a year©s course, a graduate gets an Assguard diploma and is hired for an elegant party. Hey! Wonderful. - - Only that escort must be a great guy, - I don't want to be escorted by just anybody. If money helped men to pursue women, why can't they help women to pursue men. If a woman would like to buy a man,she can go ahead with it, for God's sake. It's a free country. If there was a fantastic guy..., you know, I'm going for example to a boring party,and I know there won't be anybody there I could talk to, and I've got nobody to go with. I can go alone, drive to the other side of town... or my escort picks me up, drives me there,fills up my glass with wine, is charming, and nice and I pay him 200 and he'll go away. It's like heaven. Hello. It's nice to hear from you. A wedding is an excellent idea. I hope you'll like my photo and you'llchose me as your partner for the wedding. I'm 5'10, 196 lbs, black-hair, dark eyes Just my type. - If you have any questions, go ahead, - I've got nothing to hide, and please remember, there is a fee for the meeting, satisfaction guaranteed, half the money up front,the other half afterwards. There is a fee for a meeting, satisfaction guaranteed, I wonder how much guaranteed satisfaction is worth. Can I get a full-body photo? Hmm, he'll write back, he won't,he'll write back, he won't? Maybe he's some kind of pervert... What's wrong with him? He's probably looking fora photo or just getting it done. Hi, champ! How are you going? What did you say? Listen... will you have sometime today or tomorrow? You have to take my photo. Doesn't matter, I need one. Suck your belly in! what... take the photo of my upper body! hey, it's not me putting my pic on the website! But take your hands out of your pockets! Do you have the full figure in the frame? No. I'm glad that it is all going inthe right direction. The price is 200. And it includes a professional massage,if you'll feel like one. Wow. I'll sent my full-body shot tonight, cause I'm in the city now. I hope your interest won't end on e-mailing. Love... ...and kisses wherever you like. Hmm, wait a minute... GERMANY What involves me personally is the fact that there is a certain class of womenout there who just want to find an outlet for the dominant partof their personalities; in some informal and insignificant context, where the only thing they have to do, is to have a pleasant evening. This is exactly what I offer in a variety of ways what they want, because everyonehas a conception and desires. This is the exciting side of the profession,that you can always enjoy something new. Hi. Hi. Can I take this? Thanks. How's it going? Not bad. I'm a little off colour. I had a horse riding accident at the weekend. Nothing major, I didn't fall offbut I kind of twisted my ankle. But you can walk.- Yeah of course, it's just a bit painful that's all. No dancing though. So then it won't get in our way. Maybe a little massage would help. A massage? But isn't it a bit early? Yeah, and not here either. Of course you'll have to goa little bit higher than my feet? Really?- To my knees and thighs. Well you know, I reckon I could manage that. Hello. Can I get you something to drink? Do you want something to drink in the meantime? I'll have a coffee. A coffee? Uhuh. OK. It all started when a friend told me about his website. After a while I visited it just as a joke you understand. Then I started thinking about the descriptions on it stuff like humble, obsequious gentleman and so on, so I had another look. You know, I found something in that wordingwhich really spoke to me and I couldn't get it out of my head. From the very beginning we got on really well,he gave it a special setting being humble. And I really, really enjoyed that. He doesn't call me when something depresses him. I don't call him either. That would be too much, it would have a bad affect on my marriageor my feelings toward my partner, something would be taken away from our relationship. I pay and decide when, for how long,where, how and what we're going to do. Here's your coffee. Thanks a lot. And how about you? Well I'm pretty busy at the moment. I'm working on a load of materialabout the life of this Viennese composer. I hope I can finish it in a week, maybe two. It's great to have something creative to do. It's quite an apt intellectual balance to your other job. Yeah. So you say you have tounwind a little after last week? Uhuh, I had a complete nightmare with stuff at work; on top of that there was some crapwith my husband, he was being? I would say pretty grumpy. I don't even want to think aboutwhether he knows anything about us. Oh well... as far as I'm concernedI would say that for you, for the both of you our relationshipis a good thing really. Yes. It's true, you do offer mea certain type of service, a safety valve if you like, a release for certain thingswhich I simply don't do with him. It's pretty clear really. About six months ago I met a woman who perfectly suited the typeof things I'm really into, bearing in mind my private life. Unfortunately it didn't end that pleasantly. If I got into another relationship now there's a chance that I would start to question whether I could carry on with this other stuff It's possible that I would say yes,with pleasure, because I can't see any specific conflict between these two worlds. After all in this businessI'm not in love with these women. It's pretty normal that feelings become arousedeven in the course of one evening. But it's something completely differentthan a long-term relationship where people share eventhe most mundane issues in life. What I do, it's not exactly? I don't want to pass judgement now,it's just less than a fleeting romance. It's business. That's what I call a tattoo, it is a dragon with a poem in Chinese next to it. The poem is about my mum,she passed away in 2002. It is about my love for my mum,connected with how I live my life. I'm trying to do it the waymy mum would like me to. I think you went a bit too far with the kisses. I wonder if... you really have only a wedding in mind... Why did I go too far, Marylka... Maybe it's only your imagination? Allright... Ok then, you didn't go too far. Hmm, my imagination.... ok, whatever. Hmm, we can think of something more if you want. Tuesday, seven? We'll meet on Saturday,just before the wedding. If all the guys around me are dull, it comes to that, I go to a wedding witha guyI found on the internet and I hired him and paid him to go to the wedding with me. In Poland we have quite strict rules. Women are usually at home,taking care of their husbands, taking care of the kids and at thesame time have a job and make money. Great. That a woman does something like that.... like... no, it's not possible, how... absolutely. Instead of minding our own business,we look at others. Yes I think that this wouldn't be a problem abroad. Don't you think that a guywho advertises in the Internet is a very weak man, isn't capable...isn't he just helpless, by any chance? You know what, I'll just take the guy to the wedding and have some fun with him. So that's all it means to you? Yes OK Anyway, I understand everything,but secretly I hope... That?? that you'll do everything you can, during the party, to try not to give him... reasons to think more than he should. Listen, ok, I've got a proposition for you. What is it? I've known you for a long time. A long time. How long, 5 years?? 5 years. And I trust you. I could ask you for exampleto go with me to the wedding...
