The iron stairs Morning, M. Durieux. Morning. Odd weather, isn't it? It is. Your order is ready. M. Charles? I am coming. Is M. Durieux's order ready? I'll get it. -How much was it? -I will send you your invoice. Your order is here. -Thank you. -You are welcome. You are a regular. It's the least we can do. Don't bother. M. Charles will carry the boxes to your car. I'll open the door for you. Thank you. -See you soon, Mme Lomel. -See you soon. Etienne, are you up? Yes. I'm feeling better. -Are you sure? -Yes. Stay in bed. Read a book. I am reading "Mme Bovary" again. If you're tired, go back to sleep. Good morning. Morning. -How are you? -Fine. Please, follow me. "Thursday, 21st February, 1963. "Had a fit "at 2.25pm. "Went straight to bed. "Duration time: 30 minutes. "Fell asleep at 2.55pm." "Woke up at 3.50pm. "Sweat a lot. "Lunch: lamb cutlets, mashed potatoes." That's all you ate? -I had an orange. -Who cooks your meals? Rose does. Our maid. My wife runs the shop. She ate the same? She didn't have the mash. She doesn't like potatoes. Do you work at the shop too? I'm the salesman. In the printing shop. My wife took over the shop from her father. I canvas for customer. So you are always on the road. I am. Do you always have lunch at home? Most of the time. -Unless I'm too far. -Where do you eat? I go to the restaurant. Perfect. I'll have a look at you. Take off your jacket and your tie. You've been writing down all your meals for a month? Yes. I started January 15. You had fainted before that? Yes. December 1. I remember it perfectly. Did you mark it on a calendar? -On your agenda? -No. Each December 1, a carousel sets in front of our house. It stays there until March 15. I had my first fit after dinner. -Did you call for the doctor? -I did. Dr Maresco. He lives next door. He told me I had indigestion. -He gave me mineral water. -Open your mouth. Stick your tongue out. Give me a precise description of your fits. First, I have a bellyache. And then... I feel dizzy. I start to sweat. My head spins. My throat. It's warm at first and then it burns me. I end up throwing up. Did you see your doctor again after that? I did. He gave me a gastric sedative. It was useless. I had a fit two weeks after. Dr Maresco is young. He doesn't have a lot of experience. I don't trust him. The first fit was 3 months ago. How many of them did you have ? 6 or 7. You had one yesterday? Exactly. I decided to see someone. Did your wife recommend me? No. Women often recommend doctors to their husbands. She does not know I'm here. I often walk by. I saw your name. -Hello? -I'm listening. It's me, Louise. Yes. I wanted to tell you not to worry. Did you have another fit? No, don't worry. I stayed longer at a client's house. I will be home in one hour. Are the Leducs coming? Sure, they are. Are you alright? Yes. I'm fine. I can ask Dr Maresco to come by. No, it's fine. -Are you sure? -Yes. Well. See you later. -A tall glass of Vichy water. -Right away. You're getting dolled up. My oh my. This must be costly. I don't use all that. Wait for a few years. Stop treating me like a kid. It suited you when you needed me to protect you at the boarding school. You are right. Women get old faster than men. That's life. Come on. Let's not keep them waiting. I know what I'm saying. National service, it has become worthless. It went from two years to 18 months. I'm sure they'll reduce it even more. We'll be properly protected that way! Soldiers have become mere tourists. I'm serious. As sure as my name is Arthur Leduc, ID card services manager and winner of a belote regional championship in 1959! It's good. Did you make the cabbage? Rose helped me. Keep her then. A maid who is good a cook is hard to come by. Of course it is! Girls are useless. They finish school without knowing how to sew. Rose is nice. She keeps house. On top of all, she likes Etienne. -Does she? Charlotte was such a pain. Did she make you one? -Make me what? -A charlotte! I hope she made you a strawberry charlotte. -She was fine. She was a poor cook and touchy. I wasn't sick when she was here. -What's wrong? -He had indigestion last winter. I had one yesterday. It's something you ate. You're letting it overwhelm you. It's all in the head. Don't you think that... I look funny? Yes, you do. Very funny. Don't worry. That's the sicker you'll ever get. Eat properly and your liver will be fine. Do you remember that guy? I worked with someone named Shepard. I used to call him Shepherd. The stuffed cabbage was amazing. -It was greatly appreciated. -Thank you. -It's men against women. -Perfect. So tell me... Are you really sick? You look in shape. Louise worried over nothing. I'm fine. -I guess it's women against men. -It is. Perfect. Morning. M. Birard? Morning. I'm M. Lomel. I'm here for the salesman position. You have received my cable. Good morning. So this is a printing and a paper shop. It exists since 1922. My father funded it. Let me introduce you. Charles, Théo! Come here. M. Etienne Lomel, our new salesman. This is Théo. -Charles. -Nice to meet you. -Welcome to you. -You can call me Etienne. Morning, Etienne. Welcome to you. Thank you. Morning. -Let's go see Pierre, our printer. -Daddy? Do you know where... I'm sorry. Come. I'll introduce you. This is Louise. My daughter. This is Etienne Lomel, our new salesman. He wants us to call him Etienne. Hello, Etienne. Miss. Call me Louise, then. I'm not a "miss". Shame... I have a son-in-law. He doesn't work here. He's a history teacher. But we use as much paper as he does. Follow me. -Let's keep moving. -Goodbye. Goodbye. Please, come. This is Pierre. Etienne Lomel. I love you. Why didn't we meet before? 4 years. It's a short time. I wouldn't have married Guillaume. Fortunately, Mariette is a good alibi. At least, that's something. Having to hide. Meeting up in that creepy hotel. I'm sick of it. I love you too much. Come. How are you tonight? Are you alright? Are you in pain? No, I'm fine. I'm lucky to have you. Why do you say that? Because... I don't know what I'd be if I hadn't met you. You would've met someone else. Meeting someone... It doesn't mean that you love that someone. It's not all about meeting someone, love. Louise. Did you love Guillaume? Did you love him like you love me? Now isn't the right time to talk about this. We never talk about it. I know very little about your first husband. When he died... you didn't talk about it. There was nothing else to say. Was it a disease? You know it. He had a heart attack. I don't know if I love you more than Guillaume. But I know I love you. -Morning. -Morning. -Did you sleep well? -I did. Have a bun. Why? It's not Sunday. Madam told me you'd be happy. Did she really say that? Of course she did. Do you want some milk? As usual. Why do you ask? Just asking. I read it's not good to mix both. What do you mean? That's none of my concern, but with a liver complaint, white coffee isn't the best thing. You're nice. But it's not the milk. Black coffee makes me nervous. The stuffed cabbage was delicious. Thank you. May I take the coffee? Sure. I'll have lunch here. -Perfect. -What are you making? For you, it'll be oven-baked potatoes. Madam will have leftover cabbage. I'm off now. Is madam already at the shop? No, she had to go to her new dress-maker before 10am. M. Théo opened the shop. I didn't know. See you later. -Thank you. -Goodbye. It's me. -Anything special, Théo? -Nothing. -Morning. -Morning, Charles. I thought this would never end. She forgot I work too. She was late. I'm listening. Mariette, it's you. I just got back. I was just saying that. She's a good dress-maker but she takes her time. I'll never thank you enough. I have a customer. I need to go. Talk to you later. Rose, is that you? Yes, madam. I thought it was M. Etienne. Did he go on his round? Yes, don't worry. -Did you go at Berthier's? -No. I'm going there this afternoon. -What invoice template do they want? -They want it printed in blue ink. Is it good? Your oven-baked potatoes? Exquisite. We don't eat that a lot. Last time it was... 6 months ago. You didn't refuse to eat potatoes. I was fat back then. Do you taste thyme in it? There's a strong flavour. Rose is undoubtedly a very good cook. Before we had Rose, we had Charlotte. Who was before her? Colette. I forgot who we had before Colette. Do you remember? Sorry, were you asking me something? Who was the maid before Colette? When we got married? No, it was Colette then. I didn't get to know the one before. She must have left... when Guillaume died. Probably. It doesn't ring a bell. Wasn't it Marie? Maybe. Does it matter? I was just making conversation. I heard you had a new dress-maker. Didn't I tell you? I'm sure I did! Why did you change? Mine was getting old. Mariette gave me her name. What's the address? Near the park. Do you want a mandarin? Rose bought them. For a detailed invoice... A format like this one is more interesting. Look all this space. And... we can print the name of the garage. Right here. Can you? We'll use the font that's on your frontage. Alright. That's not bad. I was wondering if I could have coloured font. I've had enough with black font. I'm a mechanic, not an undertaker. Do you feel me? I was thinking that blue would be good for customers. What do you think? Is blue good? Are you okay? I'll be fine. Are you alright? It's nothing. Something I ate probably. Sorry. You don't look good. When did you feel bad? It was around 3.30pm. When did you eat? We always eat at 12.30. When did you finish? 30 minutes later. You felt sick 2 hours and a half later. What did you feel? Same as usual. Stomach ache. My throat was burning. I threw up. What did you eat? Veal roast and oven-backed potatoes. So did your wife? She didn't eat potatoes. The maid did. She ate potatoes. I think. We usually eat the same. It's hard to know. I'd like to ask you something. What happens if a man regularly swallows... a little bit of arsenic? It depends on his constitution. And on the dosage. Be more explicit. The food I eat... It is... It may not be... What I eat at home... is actually... I'm never sick when I eat outside. You told me your maid cooked the meals. She does. My wife helps her, but not for lunch. She's in a rush. There must be tests we could run. The best way to know if there is... poisoning... are blood and urine tests. The dosage must significant. We find arsenic in almost every living species. Do these tests. Roll up your sleeve. You'll give a blood test. We'll see what the laboratory says. I have a question. Why arsenic? I read several articles. Do you check your weight? Did you notice a weight loss? Don't make it a big deal. No problem. I must hang up. We'll see that later. Fine. Talk to you tomorrow. Who was it? A friend. -Mariette and I met her. -You went out together? We met her at the dress-maker. Let's go to the cinema. The eggs! The eggs! Marie-Louise! Michèle! Bring the eggs. Mister is waiting. Finish the pancakes. I don't get it. It's nice isn't it? Louise, I just wanted to... Do you want to tell me something? Why is it so hard? Why didn't you tell me about that friend of yours before? I don't know. It's not important. I think it is. Because it's about you. What's her name? Françoise. Is she married? She is. Let's have them over. They don't go out much. We have dinner and we play cards each week with the Leducs. It'd be nice to see other people. I'll see. I'll tell her. And then... The guy turned around and said: "It's an African elephant." I didn't eat mussels in ages. Nonsense. What did we eat at Marcel's a month ago? -What did we eat? -I had forgotten, actually. Aren't you hungry? -No. -Do you want anything else? The mussels are from the new fishmonger. They are fresh, believe me. I'm a specialist. I know when it's rotten. Rose is on leave. So I went to the fishmonger. Are you scared of being sick? I feel peaky. I'll skip over the seafood. Dr Maresco didn't say it was bad for you. You're never too careful. I'll make an omelette. Stay here, I'll... -We'll take care of it. -No, I... Well... You are a lucky one. They closed the door. Why? They want to talk about us. Chitty chatty. Your man is like this. Mine is more like that. Remember this. When women close the door, it's bad for us. You should try the mussels, it's delicious. Is Louise hiding something? What would she hide from you? You are worried about the fishmonger. You should be. Fishmongers know how to catch fish, but not only! I'm teasing you. On the other hand, let me tell you... Mariette, she's hiding something. And so am I. I'm no fool. We are men, aren't we? Opportunity makes the thief. But I'm like a thief in the night. May I? Arthur, I... I have a favour to ask. But don't tell anyone. I want to make Louise a surprise. You can ask me anything. For her birthday, I would like to find the maid who worked here before we got married. You're working at the ID card issuing services, so it should be easy. Not that easy. I need her name. Marie Thouret. Are you sure? Positive, Marie Thouret. I got her name from a neighbour. But she didn't have her address. I'll see what I can do. Do you mind going back there? Or they'll imagine things. What about our dress-maker? Arsenic is found in all living species. We found a small quantity of arsenic in your blood and urine, but... it doesn't mean anything. It's a usual dosage. But... I lost weight again. That's more disturbing. There must be other... other tests. But they have to be made no more than one hour after the poison was swallowed. If you are poisoned. How long have you been married? Six years. Any children? May I ask you why? My wife can't have any. With me or her first husband. She doesn't know you're here? -Where are you going? -To the dress-maker. Do you need anything? No, what about your coffee? I'll have it with Mariette. Bye. You scared me. I didn't mean to. You'll catch cold. I'm not cold. You don't want to be sick. Would you be sorry for me? You didn't look too good last night. I thought... you... I... You were sick. Forgive me. I'm sorry, Louise. Sorry. Louise. I love you. Why such a rush? I work for your father. Today is not... It's not what? The day we usually meet. So what? So... Your husband doesn't work on Thursdays. He's been sick since yesterday. What's wrong? I don't know. -Did he go to the doctor? -He did. Doctor Rivet put me to the world. Dad swears only by him. Being ill is hard. Do you really love me? Of course I do. I will never let you leave. Never. Good morning, sir. If you're here to sell me books, it's a waste of time. Sorry to disturb you. I am looking for Mme Marie Thouret. Why? What is it for? He wants to talk to you. Good morning. And... She has numerous nightmares. She says she thinks about her first husband. She blames herself for not having done everything to cure him. There was not much to do. He was very sick. It was his heart? That's what they said. But you... you saw him every day until he died. I certainly was there when he fell sick. But I do not how it happened. He kept on losing weight, that's all I knew. When he died, he was as heavy as a 12-year old child. Even the undertakers were surprised. M. Guillaume was so nice. He could not eat anything eventually. He vomited all he ate. Mme Louise was making him all his favourite dish. It was at their wedding. Dear M. Guillaume. That's the real him. He looked like this before all this. As for me, I didn't know a heart disease could make you that bad. He was unrecognisable. Do you mind if I keep this picture? Not at all. -Thank you. -Goodbye. -Good evening. -Good evening. Do you have a scale? This way. Step on it. 72.2 kilos. Something is wrong? I lost weight. It is nothing. It happens. If it goes on, go see your doctor. Hello. I'm in a rush. We're waiting for a delivery. -Which delivery? Sud-Ouest Paper Mill. Madam made you a surprise, sir. She bought them this morning. Thank you. Last time, you liked it. I figured you'd be glad. I must run. See you later. Thank you. Rose... Thank you for not having told my wife about last time. I didn't mean to disrespect you. I love my wife. You saw me the other day. At the cinema. You saw me with my boyfriend before. You love each other. Love is everything. Aren't you eating your brioche? I am. I'll send your tests on the spot. The laboratory will phone me the results. Come by tomorrow. What was for breakfast? White coffee and brioche. That's it? I put jam on the brioche. Go home and go to bed. Say you don't feel good. Only drink water until tomorrow. We will try to cope. Doctor, is it that easy to get hold of arsenic? It is. We gave this customer a discount. -Did you? -There were marks on the paper and he is a regular. It seemed reasonable. Will you excuse me? Etienne? What's wrong? -Did you have a fit? -No, it's not that. I may have the flu. It was best to go home. Honey. Come. Go to bed. Do you have any fever? I don't know. Come. How much is it? Birard Paper Shop, hello. Hello, Mme Destivel. Sure. Your order is ready. If you prefer, yes. Please, hold, I'll ask. Is it possible to deliver Mme Destivel tomorrow? -Yes, but not before 11am. -Fine. Tomorrow at 11am, does it suit you? I'll mark it down. Perfect. Goodbye. She could've told us. She always does this. Did I wake you? I wasn't sleeping. How do you feel? Your glass is empty. I prefer Vichy water. I'll ask Rose to buy some. What do you want to eat? I'm not hungry. You need to eat or you'll get weak. I'll eat tonight. Won't you accompany me? When I get better. I'm listening. Hello. I'm busy right now. Exactly. I'm sorry. Yes. Me too. Who was it? Mariette. I thought it was a client waiting for my visit. No, I don't want to wait that long. No, what I want is... It's you. -Good morning. -I want to be next to you. I want to be inside you. Inside you. Do you see what I mean? -The pupils will be happy. -That's for sure. I do. I'd be very glad. I have to go. My dad needs the phone. Fine. Thank you. Bye, Jacqueline. I'll give you bloody Jacqueline. Come in. I'm going out, do you need anything? Could you buy me another bottle of Vichy water? I will. Louise? Are you here? M. Etienne? She went to the post office. I remember, sorry. Is there something wrong? No. Everything is fine. Thank you. Sorry to have bothered you. Sorry. What do you need? I was scared. You weren't in the bedroom. I was looking for some aspirin. I was looking through your stuff. You don't need it to be pretty. Did you take your temperature? Come. I'll get straight to the point. The samples made yesterday show you swallowed a dosage of arsenic higher than... what is usually found. Dosage that, if repeated, slowly and gradually kills you. I'm sorry, M. Lomel. "I am sorry." I am. My wife said this to her friend when she had to hang up the phone. "I am sorry." You don't say this to your friend. You say this to someone you don't know. What are you implying? Louise, my wife, is killing me. Like she killed her 1st husband. That's him. Guillaume Gatin. Before he got ill. A handsome man. When he died, he was as light as a kid. Louise poisoned him because she had a lover. Someone younger. Wilder. Someone who made her think they would not get old. That they'd be forever young. I was that man, doctor. Now there is another man. Who is doing the same. Louise is beautiful. She'll refuse to change. You have to make a decision. Did he... Did Guillaume know? Did he let her murder him? That's a possibility. When you're madly in love. Madly. You said it yourself. It is a murder attempt. As a doctor, I must tell the police. -You can't do that. -I have to. -There is no proof. -You are the proof. I could have put the arsenic myself. Be reasonable. I could be killing myself. I came here so you can tell me if it was working. Please, don't tell anything. It is my secret. Whisky please. Sure. Brandy, please. Brandy. In a large glass. A large glass. Sure. It looks like a dive. It's not appealing. But once you get inside, you find a swell place. The slate fireplace... The food was exquisite. I remember. Etienne, you've got your appetite back. I feel better. You said you felt beat. I didn't believe a thing. Did you see a doctor? No need to. I decided that I wanted to live. I went to the new fishmonger. The mash is delicious. Shame you don't eat it. I never eat it. Don't make yourself ill. Is your dress-maker good? Yes. Very. -We see her tomorrow. -Do you? -I took my day off for you. -No. I'm going alone. You could go with Mariette. I made an appointment. You can cancel. You don't need a dress urgently. -Is it a summer dress? -I told you I can't cancel. I guess that dress must be worth it. You're annoying. I won't go there! Problem solved. Nice work. My... You were harsh on her. I'll apologise. Don't bother. Mariette is taking care of her. Come on. The matter is closed. -The matter is closed. -Sorry. I didn't mean... We know it's a trick to beat us at belote. You won't fool us. Let me tell you about Tardieu. Remember? He works at the driver's licence offices. That guy has bad luck. The other day, he gets to the office. -Good morning, Rose. -Good morning. You are here? You look surprised. You had an appointment. It's this afternoon. Sorry about last night. You lost it. This is for you. -Did you go get them? -I did. I'm not mad at you. It's a shame. I'm not having breakfast. I have a client to meet. Who? A new one. I hope so. I won't be back for lunch. -I must go. -Drink your coffee at least. I'll have one with the client. -See you. -See you. -Charles? -Yes, Madam? -I am leaving. -Alright. Goodbye sir. Glazier! -I'll call you. Okay? -Okay. Thanks. Etienne. What have you done? It's just... I visited too many clients. -You can be happy. -Come. Orders were placed. Goodbye. Be careful. Are you eating here? I'm meeting a client at 1pm. I can't. I was going to cook something nice. Too bad. It's my night off tonight. You are sweet. I'm sorry. Let's not talk about it anymore. Do you feel better? Who is it? I'll introduce you. Hello. I don't think you met my son, Olivier. It is only the 3rd time you come here. Hello, sir. He won't be a printer. He is studying to become a doctor. Sorry. I must go. Charles? Can you take care of the delivery? Thank you. Hi, honey. Hi. Gentlemen, let me offer you a drink. We happen to be all here for the closing time. With great pleasure. -Follow me. -Sure. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Shall we go at Jeannette's? -Let's. Goodbye. -Let's drink to our health. -And the company's. Especially to yours as you've been tired lately. It's only a bad memory now. I caught the flu and it lasted a long time. Your son could have treated me. He still has many years to study. Is he telling you all about the diseases he studied? He doesn't live with us anymore to his mother's displeasure. It's more convenient. He has a hotel room near college. Where is college again? Avenue d'Ambois. That's right. He stays at the Quimper Hotel. Customers want fancy things now. Well, colour is the future. The carpentry asked for a drawing on their headings. -But no colours. -I saw it. A carpenter and his saw. Expensive! It will impact on customers' bills. To top it all, Gaubert wants his picture on the calendars. You'll catch cold. Are you mad at me? Why would I be? I gave you some hard time. You know... Even though Dr Maresco said you were fine, I was getting worried. You thought I was sick. I was wondering. That I was ill like Guillaume? He had a heart condition. Don't bring that up again. When he was lying in this room, he must have been happy too. Watching you coming back from the shop. Walking up the stair. First, he could see your hair. Your forehead. Your eyes. You entire face. Your smile. You smiled at him, didn't you? I did. Are you crying? I'm not. Do you forgive me? For what? For loving you like I love you. -Hello, Charles. -Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Are you eating here? I'm listening. Yes. Wait a second. Hold on. It's my friend Françoise. I'll eat outside. Me too. -Have a nice evening. -You too. Hello, may I help you? M. Thévenin lives here, doesn't he? He does. On Wednesdays, he is never back before 9pm. Is he waiting for you? He is a friend's son. Since I was in the area... Give me your name. I'll leave him a message. I'll call in again. Does he live alone? This is an indiscreet question. Well... He is young, do you see what I mean? Thanks. Goodbye. -We'll go after. -We'll go to the Caveau after. -We go to the Caveau after. -Good idea. See you tomorrow. M. Lomel? Do you want to see me? No, I was walking by. Fine. Goodbye. Hello, did I reach the police? My name is Mme Lomel. I own a paper shop 35 rue des Petits-Pères. My husband did not come home last night. I know it is 5am. I just woke up. I fell asleep waiting for him. No. Never. He is our company salesman. He comes home every night. None. Nothing. Please, sir. Lomel. L-O-M-E-L. Etienne Lomel. Etienne. SUBTITLES : RED BEE MEDIA
