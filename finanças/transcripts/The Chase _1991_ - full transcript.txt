It's been a rotten winter for skiing. I guess a lot of hotel people are gonna lose their shirt. - Ah I wouldn't worry about it, before the season's over they'll be wearing silk. - Would you bet on that? - Yeah, in this night class I've been takin' we've been studying Colorado weather for the last 100 years, and I got news for you, it snows around here. A lot. Now what'd you say about a be? - Keys are still in it, Texas plates. Dispatch, this is 142, I need a make on a two door Challenger, Texas plates Oscar Delta Charlie 5-3-9. Abandoned vehicle, possible steal. - The great metropolis of Bailey. You ever been here, Jim? - No. Must've been doing more than 55 and missed. - Damn, what a rush! Hello Vietnam, woo! - You gotta be kidding me. - Nah man. Man guys 19, 20, flying those suckers like that? Hell there's a lot goin' on too. - Yeah, all those women. - Nah I ain't talkin' about the women, I'm talkin' about black market, I'm talkin' about dope, it don't cost there what it does here. Just for kicks you had the war. - Yeah. You could also die too, you know. - Not me, no way. I wouldn't go there unless I know I'd come out alive. - Well how in the hell can you know that? - Well, there's some people in this world and nothing happens to em no matter what they do. - Yeah. Sure. - Yeah. - Must be fun to ride in something like that. - I'd be afraid! - Nah you wouldn't. No worse than one of those Ferris wheels you're always wanting to get on. Come on, let's take a little walk up to the mine. Too bad we can't go fishing. But it's still too cold. - We can come back in the summer. - No Ladybug, this'll be our last trip. Old truck can't keep going up that hill. It just don't work like it used to. - Can't you fix it? - We don't have the money, Punkin. - Why? - You remember me telling you how I used to run up and down these hills, day after day looking for gold? You know what gold is? No more gold. All gone. - No gold, no money. - You can be so smart, you know that? Ladybug, one day you're gonna be pretty much on your own. I'm not gonna be around. - Yes you will! Everything will be like always! Always! - No, not exactly, not the way you think. Oh we'll be together alright but, only like here. Ladybug, Ladybug. - Ladybug. - Fly away home. Your house is on fire, your children are gone. All except one. - Julian!

I'll give ya back 20 in the night. - I won't have anything for lunch, I need to eat. - Skip a meal! You're getting too fat anyway. Thanks baby. - Now Gillespie will be calling in at noon, yes. Yes he'll call you back, you're welcome, bye. You're late, again. - I'm sorry. - So am I! Do you know what happens to an answering service that doesn't answer? So, what I'm I supposed to do? You tell me. - I said I'm sorry, I, I really am. Things aren't going very well for me right now. - With your guy? I saw what happened out there. - No, I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do! - Honey. I'm sorry I yelled at you. - That's alright. - Can I help you, Sir? - Prescott, FBI. - That's a pretty good print, right there. - Yeah, you ain't gonna lift it here, though. - Well this is a sight to behold! - Larry, you old son of a gun! You remember my son Dale. - Sure, Dale. - How you doin'? - Well I never thought I'd see you workin' vehicles. - Well his time's comin' to hang em up. - Yeah. Believe it or not I've got four more months to go and they've opened the gate to the pasture. (laughing) Eight hours a day, five days a week. I didn't say no! - I don't blame ya. - Well she's all yours. Vehicle ID and serial number, same as your want sheet. - You figure it's been here the whole time? - It's October, sure looks like it. We don't know anything yet but we got some pretty good prints. It's too cold to lift em from here, so we're gonna take it into the garage. (helicopter blades whirring) (suspenseful music) - While you're at it, these are corporate Money Market accounts so please, don't mix em up. - I won't, Roger. - Hi. - Hey. I'd like to cash this check. - Okay, it's out of state. - Yes, my father sent it to me. - Do you have an account here? - No, but I'm a student over at the City College. I have a student ID and a driver license. - Live around here? - Well I just moved here, and I've been down at the springs but being a ski bum is not for me so I'm gonna catch the new semester. You know I got a great apartment down on Sheridan. - Oh I live on Sheridan! - Oh really. - Yeah. - Well now maybe I get to see you around sometime. - Maybe. 51, 52, 53, 54, 5500. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Oh and if you want to open an account, consider our credit union. - Thank you. - Okay. Oh, excuse me. - Cute eh? - Only if his check doesn't bounce. - Newsroom? What time? - 12:30. - Do you know if the other stations are gonna cover it? - Definitely. - They are! Okay, we're on our way, thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Getting your real estate license? - No my meteorology finals are coming up. Two years of night school, be glad when it's over. - I got it, I got it! I am gonna put together a scratch team for each shift. Something goes down, we are gonna be ready, two minutes flat, bang, on the air! How about it? Anybody want to anchor a scratch newscast? - Yes me, absolutely! Will you sign me up please? - Peter I'd like to-- - Hey, hey I need a camera crew, who's up? - Big Stair, how about you? - No I don't think so. - Winnie! - Peter. - Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, would you try your hand at a scratch anchor for me? Come on now I am serious! - [Winnie] No. - Can anybody get a bagel! Charlie why are the bagels always gone by 8 o'clock? A bagel! - We got a perfect thumbprint off that gas cap, textbook. We ran it, Washington came back positive with a Phillip Hutchinson. We asked for his file, but it hasn't come yet. - Well we don't have much of a package either, but I did come up with his printout. - Escaped from a Texas State pen where he was serving life? At only 22? - Yeah all we can hope for is that he stole another car and he kept going. - Bad guy eh? - Yeah! Maybe worse. - Please no, no! - Hey! You! Freeze! Somebody call the police! Freeze! Somebody call the police! Police! Call the police! - Hey what's going on? - Get an ambulance. We need an ambulance here, now! - Zebra 24, I'm in chase. Chevy Blazer, red light, I'm chasing a robbery suspect from 44th and Sheridan. - You're pushin' it a little bit, wouldn't you say? - I don't know, just driving the road. - Say aren't you that new guy working with Tom Jackdaw, helping with the tows? - That's right. - Well you're lucky I ran into ya first. State Police catch you, they'd bust you good. While we're at it, Sheriff gave me this for Tom. Said it was for the last three tows we owed him, services rendered. You gonna see him? - Sure, sure no problem. Nobody ever had too much money, right? - That's right! Slow down, damnit. - Hey Smokey! Fill me in, will ya? - ATM bash. You'd think the bank would send out two guys, but one guy roaming around with a sack full of money, I mean this is asking for it. - Yeah. - I'll catch a ride home. Don't wait up for me. - I learned that a long time ago! - Dad? Don't you ever sleep? - Oh your mother and I were out to dinner and we just-- - Yeah I know, once a cop, always a cop. - Right, well it coulda been perhaps a much worse situation. But the suspect was frightened away by this man here, who was walking his dog. The man could see that something was not right, he shouted to the suspect, who grabbed some cash. Now we don't know how much at this time. - [Reporter] So this man saw him get away, what was he driving? - The car is perhaps a Blazer, black, maybe red. - Who is it? - It's me Tom, open up! - Just a minute! How ya doin'? - Hey! We saw the light is on! There's an awesome film on TV. - Well a lotta good that'll do me, they cut my cable, I didn't pay my bill last month. - Well can't you like hotwire it or something? - Ah sorry Tom, maybe next week. - How about a video, you got some videos? - Tom, next week, I'm gonna be goin' to bed. - Hey okay. Come on baby, we go to bed too. - Alright. - Hey Tom, hold up a second. Hey look I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you. - Hey it's okay. Listen Mark, Lynn she's got a friend. Yeah she's a real looker too, and I told her about ya, she's interested. Why don't we rent a video, we can have a party? - I tell ya what, I rent the videos and you paint my Blazer. - What the hell for, that paint's okay. - Well I wanna trade it in and I can get a better deal with some new paint. You got a can layin' around there somewhere right, Tom? - Sure, brown. You like brown? - Yeah, I love brown. - I can't believe it, those guys had him! They had him and they lost him! - Will you forget about it, it happens to everybody. Besides you oughta be thinking about something else. Aren't you two about due to go to the hospital? - Not yet, obstetrician says we're still about two weeks away. - Well don't call me in the middle of the night when it happens. - Oh does that mean you won't come? - You know better than that! Now lemme see here, unless I'm cuckoo, it was, I read something in one of these. - FBI? - Yeah. Bingo. ATM holdup in Texas, same MO. Hit a guy with a tire iron. - Phillip Hutchinson, who's Phillip Hutchinson? - Remember that car we found? - Yeah? - His fingerprints were all over it. I'll call Texas tomorrow. They gotta have a picture of him. Maybe we can draw a beat on this guy. - Come on Tom, look at this! - Hey brown is brown. - Well it sucks! - Well I ain't doin' it again! - Well maybe just do the top in white maybe? - Well I've got some cream. Some old Dodge paint, maybe that'll look good. - Yeah that'll be good, I'll get to maskin' it. Yeah, alright. - That's Roxanne, I told her about you. Hi baby. - So, you're Tom's famous mystery man. - [Tom] I thought maybe you two oughta get acquainted before Friday night. - We're having a party Friday night. Yeah, it's at your place. Tom said you didn't like bars. - Yeah whatever. - Well la-dee-da. - Oh hey listen don't pay no attention to that, I told you, he's just a little strange. - Yeah well he doesn't seem too friendly. - If the ladies are friendly, guys don't have to be. Oh don't take it personal now baby. Another big one. - It's that time, so what are you gonna do tonight? - I'm gonna watch the soap I've been taping. - Good night, Fran. - Hey, you can watch your soap any time. I found this great new aerobics class, come with me. - Me? - yeah, I enrolled you, come on. My treat, come on. I told the instructor all about you, her name is Sharon, you should see figure! Oh we gotta go, we got 40 minutes to get there. - Fran. - I won't take no for an answer. - I couldn't do it, ever. - Tammi, I signed you up. - But I don't have any gym clothes. - So there's a shop on the way, we'll get you something, come on. - No, no I can't. I can't see myself like that. Even in high school, I always used to get get myself excused from gym. - Oh you're kidding. - It's so easy for you. - Well it's not as if you're in some kind of competition. - But I am! It's always been like that, and I always lose. - You know this is the one thing I don't like about you. You will always lose if you keep feeling sorry for yourself! Come on. Come on, let's go. Fine, it's your life. Here's the address. - Yeah, come in. Yeah Mike, you wanted to see me, what's up? - Yes, sir. I been going to night school, and in a couple of weeks I'm taking an exam. When I pass it I'll be a fully accredited meteorologist. - Is that right, I didn't know that. Congratulations. - Thank you. Well the other day you were talking about putting together a scratch team. - Yeah? - Well if you do go through with that program, I'd sure like you to consider me as a you know a backup weatherman. It'll give me a chance to break in. - Oh, I see. Well I'm not saying it's not possible, because the station's policy is to promote from within wherever possible. But you know your job usually takes you out of the station. When I might need you on a scratch basis, you're liable to be gone. Sorta catch-22 idn't it? - Okay. If you give me a job as a weatherman, I'll quit flying. - Well Mike, in my book good management means that you use people according to their strengths, and yours is flying. You're the best. I'm gonna have to leave you where you are, Mike. But I do appreciate your letting me know how you feel. - Thank you. - Oh it's not use, I'm gonna be late. Julian can you give me a lift over, the car won't start. - Baby I'd like to, but I gotta meet somebody-- - I'm trying to keep this job, please! - I can't help you. I really can't. How do I look, okay? I'll see ya. - So your, your daddy's name is Wallis eh? - Yes, sir. He's a born cop. - Yeah, and how bout you? - Oh I don't know, all my life I remember him telling me I was his replacement, sounded good to me. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Dad, this is Inspector Hammil, Austin Police. - How're you doin'? - How are you, sir? - I'm fine, thank you. Most folks just call me Hammer. - [Dale] He wanted to talk to fellas who found the car. - Well that's about all we did find. - Well when your request for Hutchinson's package hit my desk I decided to come on up here and look around. - You must really want this dude. - Yeah, I sure do. I'm the one that put him away the first time. State of Texas had him, let him escape. Which means he's still my responsibility. - I couldn't get my car started! - Honey you can't get your life started. Look I'm not exactly Joan of Arc here, just a lady who never found her niche and fell for all the wrong guys, so I speak with some expertise. And it's just, it's very difficult for me to see someone as young and capable as you paddling for the falls just as fast as you can. How many jobs have you had this past year, four, five? - Four. - So the pattern is when things get rough, you run and hide. Like with this guy. Have you told him yet? - It's all so confusing. I try, I really try. I just can't seem to get everything together. It's always something, like my car. - Well don't you have a brother, or someone who can help you fix them? - My dad. - [Supervisor] Well? - We're sort of not talking. He thinks I've disappointed him. - Have you? - Maybe. - Well kid, when it doubt, punt. Go back to go, recycle, however you wanna name it. Call him. Listen I have an errand to run, I'll be back in an hour or so. And if you need to use the phone. - [Mr Whipple] Hello? - Dad? - Well, hi Glory. - [Gloria] I'm not interrupting? - No, no, no, it's nice to hear from you. How're you doing? - Oh I'm fine. I have a job with an answering service. - Well that's good. Why you calling? - Well, I need help, with the car. - Now this punk is a real bad guy. At 18, he has a conviction for kidnapping. At 20, two armed robbery convictions. At 21, assault with a deadly weapon. That's when we put him away for life, but last October, he escaped. Stole a car, and he split. Now we believe, and the FBI concurs with us, that he is still in the Denver area. Now we got no proof of that, only the MO of the ATM heist, and the bad check at the credit union. Now, all these are the way this punk works. This perp is an accomplished criminal. He also thinks he can get away with anything. And he'll continue to do that until we put him in the slammer for keeps. So, be warned. Now Sergeant Wallis thinks he's driving a Blazer, and the color and the year are unknown. But that's something. Now look over here at his picture. Now, this punk doesn't always look like this, and don't expect him to, he changes his appearance all the time. But with max security life looking him in the face, he'll do anything to anybody any time. And my advice to you all is, if you run into him, you'd better get him first. - Come on man, get up. Get up! Get up, go! You, I said you yeah, you see what I got in my hand! Come on move back, hold back yo! Come on get down! All of you three get down! Come on! Go over there, get down! Come on move it! Come on lady, what are you doin' move it! You, open the drawer. Now, come on open the drawer and step back! You, put it in the bag, come on! Give me your car keys. Get down everybody, get down! Gimme the car keys! Step back man, get down! Get down! - Attention all units, we have an armed robbery at the Alliance Federal, 1222 North Baker. Suspect believed to be heading west on Coalfax, driving a Steele, a blue Cutlass. Any car to cover? - Maybe get us a chase? - Hey every cameraman's dream. - Dispatch, this is Baker 92, we have lost, repeat lost the blue Cutlass, eastbound on Coalfax. - Hell. I didn't want an Emmy anyway. - Hold it! Okay, try it. Well that should be alright for a bit. I mean you figured this heat was worn out when I gave it to you. Wonder it lasted as long as it has. - Yeah, it's been good to me. - We miss you, Glory. Maybe I said some things I shouldn't have said but, well your mother and I, I mean we're people too. We wanted a lot for you. Here you are, you got no education, you're living with a guy who doesn't even have a job, maybe even worse. You're going nowhere but down. It's hard for us. - I don't wanna talk about this. - Well you're gonna have to, sooner or later. You're just so much better than what you're becoming! - Well, the things you don't like about me, that's me. I am what I am, but you. You always wanted me to do what was expected. You want me to be just like everybody else! - No, never. I want you to be you. - Well, I am me! Only you can't handle it because you see everything from your point of view! What about my point of view? What about my dreams? My feelings, don't they count? What about me! I happen to be pregnant. - The way you're hitting the books, I figured it was the least I could do. - Thank you. - So, gonna pass? - Yeah. Will I end up in the class, that's another story, but I'll pass. Although now I almost wonder why I'm doing it. It's just been my dream. Like getting my wings in the Army so I could fly, I figured when I got this, I could be a weatherman on television. - So, who says you can't? - Peter. He was nice enough and he didn't say it couldn't happen but it isn't what I was hired to do. He called it a catch-22. - He said that? - Yeah. So I've decided that if I can't get started in the weather business at Channel Four, I'm gonna quit. - Mike you can't. - Yeah I know, I love it here. But I wanna be the first real flying weatherman. I wanna, fly into the mountains and film the snow as it's coming in. Or a summer squall as it races across the plains. I wanna take all the beauty of the elements and show it to all those people who never get outta their chairs. Nobody's ever done that. - Well, it's been my experience around the newsroom that things change. Maybe you'll get lucky. - Yeah, sure. But what is luck? - Luck is where opportunity meets preparation. All we can do is prepare. Opportunity is in the hands of the gods. - Oh darling, you do love me, don't you? - Oh yes, yes! Darling I've been such a fool! - It doesn't matter now, we're together. - Owen, forgive me! - Of course, can you ever forgive me? - Oh, darling! - Geez, what a stupid picture! - How can you say that, darlin'? - Easy, there's a lot more to it they never showed! - Well I liked it a whole lot. - Sure, and they all live happily ever after, as if it's possible. - Yeah, and the check's in the mail. - Oh yeah, it's possible. - You think so? - That's right, it's possible, but it ain't possible here. - Oh well you see what he means is, in Brazil, it's possible. - Brazil? You ever been to Brazil? - Yeah well that's where he's goin'! - Yeah? - Yeah, look. - How come? - Cus I don't wanna be cold anymore. Cus I don't wanna wear hats or gloves, cus I don't wanna well I don't wanna worry about anything. - You gonna take me with ya? - Oh, this pizza's colder than you know what! - Well come over here, I'll warm you up. Come over here. - How about you, Mark? Are you just like the pizza? - Depends. - On what? - I get bored real easy. - Why, whatever do you mean? You're talking to just a born again missionary country girl. - Sure I just bet you are. - Hey. - What? - You know Valentine's Day's coming. - I better get one. - You gonna send me a valentine, Mark? - Well I don't know. - When are you gonna know? - Why don't you just ask me in the morning? - I'm hungry. - Well we could warm up some pizza. - Those old ovens take forever! - We could go over to your house. - Well what about the party? - Why don't we have a party of our own? Come on. - Hey how come you don't have any pictures? I love pictures. - What kinda pictures? - Oh you know, family, pictures of mom, you know. Everybody's got pictures. You got a mother, don't you? - No I don't. - Come on, everybody's got a mother. - No I don't, and you just shut up about it! You mind your own business, you understand? - No, no I'm serious now. I've got 100 days left and I've made a decision. We're going to go on a cruise. - You? Cooped up on a ship for a week? - Sure, why not? I wanna go someplace with you, just you. Someplace nice where there are no telephones and we don't know anybody. Where we can just unwind and forget about what it was like being a cop. - I love you madly. But I don't believe that for a second. You'll get another job. Consulting, or with some security firm. Nothing's gonna change. - That is where you are wrong! Sure, I love being a cop. But I'm not gonna be a Rent-a-Cop or a cop in sheep's clothing! Actually I'm going into sales. - Sales! - Yeah, sales. - My, my! How leopards change their spots. - Yeah well there's some spots that this leopard is gonna keep. - Oh that's good. Come on. - Your buddy wouldn't know, wouldn't know shanola if it fell on his shoes. He said you were strange, he don't know the half of it whoa! Where you from? - Shut up. - How when I first met you, I didn't even think you liked women. - I don't. Mark! You in there! - What the hell is that? It's the cops, Ferris County. I don't got a phone. Yeah, just a minute! Hold up! - Hey Mark! We got us a wreck, I can't find Tom! Hey! - Yeah, I'm right here! Eight miles south, and bring your long cable! This sucker really airmailed himself into Dodge Canyon. Get your butt in gear and move it! - Alright! I'll be right back. Don't go touchin' anything. - Yeah, Wallis. Yeah? Yeah, sure. Okay. - Work? - Nope, that was Dale. Melody's in labor! Rose Memorial Hospital! - Dr Hellinger to neurology, Dr Hellinger to neurology please. - Well, doc says she's in for a long night. - Hey, we didn't come here to catch a train. - No. - I don't remember it taking so long when you were in there. - It didn't. - You know, women do know how to do this. She'll be just fine. - This means a lot to you, doesn't it? - Yeah. Yeah it does. I don't know how to explain this but, it's almost like I've been given a second chance. All those years when you were growing up sort of without me. You had a dad, but you didn't. I wasn't really there. - You know I used to think it was me. Like when I was in Little League, I kept asking ya to come see me play. Finally you said okay. And then the next Saturday sure enough, boy you were out there yelling your head off. And I go oh for five, and I drop two fly balls. We lost 16-1. - [Bob] Yeah, I remember that. - You never made it to another game. - It wasn't because I didn't want to. - I know that. I guess I had to become a cop to really understand it, but I do now. - Yeah. Well, I have made up my mind to be a hell of a lot better grandfather than I was a father. - Hey. You did just fine. - I decided to come tell you personally, everything's all finished, and it went just fine. - Well she told me to go home and get some sleep, she said she'd wait till morning! - It wasn't exactly up to her! Congratulations, it's a girl. - Which officially makes you a! - You think that guy's gonna make it? - Oh yeah, I've seen a lot worse than that come through it. I'll tell you what to do with the car in the morning. Take it easy. - You bet. What the hell you doing? - Nothing. - That stuff was hidden in the closet, what the hell were you doing in the closet? - I just, I just wanted to get to know you better. You know like, like this one. You said you didn't have a mother, who's that? Hey! - What else did you find? - Nothing nothing! I didn't mean anything by it you know they're just pictures! Nobody knows who you are! - That's right, nobody knows who I am! Oh you women, you women, you are all! You asked for it! Oh I'll kill you! I'll kill you! - [Roxanne] No! - I'll kill you! Open up, you better! Oh Ma. - I think that could be him but, I don't know, he had an accent, I think he was Spanish. Things happened real fast. - What about his car, anyone of you see it? - No, he just walked in and was there. But after it was over, one of the people in the bank, some guy, said he'd wondered why he'd taken somebody else's car when he'd seen him drive up in his own. - What kind of car? - I think he said a Blazer. - What color was it, was it red? - He didn't say. - Thank you. - It's Monday, 10 o'clock. That's the 8th, right, right. Yeah! I got a goodie babe! A major goodie! You make the pickup and we're in Fat City. You hear me? I said you got a pickup Monday. - I don't wanna do it. - Oh you don't wanna do it eh? I know you. I know what you want. - Please, not anymore! - Come on, sweetheart. - Not anymore! - I got a little something here. Lighten you up. - I said no! No more drugs! - You know what's gonna happen to you if you be a goody two shoes? You hear me! - I'm pregnant. - You're what? - I'm gonna have a baby. - Oh, great. That's just what I need. Just what I need! - You made the truck work? - Gotta warm it up, can't just let it sit. - Now we go to the mountains. - No, no. - The mountain make me happy. - Yeah, me too. But it's real hard for me up there. Well I don't, I don't breathe so well anymore. Could be, time's coming. - I don't like it when you talk like that. - No, I don't either Punkin. - I will never let you go. - You know the easiest thing to do is just tell him. I brought you a peace offering. I'm sorry I got mad at you, I am really. - That's alright. - You know men aren't real smart. You have to let em know. - What if I made valentines for everyone in the office? I could give him one too, that way he won't think that much about it. - Why don't you just make one, and then give it to him, and see what happens? - I couldn't do that. - You know I, I saw you through the window the other day at aerobics. You came right up to the door. - I went as far as I could. - But it's not enough, is it? I didn't make this up okay, but somebody said that a journey of 1000 miles begins with the first step. But you've gotta take it. It gets easier afterwards, I promise. - Fran, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. - Hey, I thought you were off to Texas? - Yeah, well I was but, I found out I had some more vacation time. - We think we're about to get a break. - I really have to laugh. Here my old man was just doing vehicles, you show up and he's pushed his way into a bank robbery investigation. - Well it's awful hard to get it outta your system. Still, the MO for those three banks and that ATM, is awful close to the Hutchinson file. Frequency's increasing, too. - Bob felt that we had enough information to issue an APB on this guy and, you know so we done that about an hour ago and we're just gonna sit back, relax, and flush him out. - Maybe. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. I been tellin' Hammer, Colorado's not like Texas. - It's true, the damn Rocky Mountains are like a wall. Coordination between jurisdictions is almost impossible. - If you go 40 miles up 285, you go back 40 years. - Well Bob maybe the next time that this guy makes a hit, y'all will get in there and shut them roads off. And if he runs that way, then hell we just slam the door in his damn face. - Wouldn't take an army. You couldn't miss a red Blazer. - If it's still red. - Just don't go hooking me up with any of your old girlfriends, alright? - Yeah well you don't have to worry about that anymore. At least not around here. Roxanne is taking care of your reputation real good. You did bust her window. - No I did not. - Well that's not what she said in The Gold Dust last night. She said that you were meanest loony young crazy she'd ever met, how you hit her in the face! - Geez. - You can't do that stuff man! One of the bar maids told her how she outta be going to the cops, and I ain't so sure she ain't gone and done it. - I'm gonna be right back, this looks good. - You're not gonna wear that shirt? - Sure, why not, I'm proud of it! - Tough day? - Nah just a dumb stakeout. - You know I still worry after all these years. I hear a car backfire in the street, and I think of all the things that could happen. And I get a chill. It hasn't been easy. - I know. But at least we don't have to worry about that anymore. - No. I don't want things to go on like they are, I don't. I don't wanna do your damn pickups. I wanna keep my job, and get my life together. I'm not alone anymore. - What about us? I love you. Look, just do this one? We'll make it the last. I'll never ask again, ever. Okay? Come on. - Good morning. - Yeah. - Roger. - What? - Nevermind. - Peter wants some footage of that new cloverleaf over the I-70, he's gonna make a feature out of it or something. Anyway, grab your camera, let's go. - Come on, what's the hurry? Last I heard, it was made out of concrete. - Yeah it still is, but Peter wants it now. - Cut to the south and then head east. That'll give you the best sun angle. - Check. - Hi. - Hi, I'd like to cash a check. - Sure. - I want all of the cash, understand? All of it! Something you don't understand honey? - No, sir. I understand. - [Hutchinson] Okay, give me the cash. Come on! - I got it, stickup alarm, 4593 Pecos, Rio Grande Credit Union. - Come on, move it! - Going city wide, attention all officers. Any cars to cover 4593 Pecos, the Rio Grande Credit Union? Okay, he's one white male in his 20s, five foot 11. Been gone a couple of minutes now, driving white over brown Blazer. - Pay dirt! Left eastbound on 46th from 4593 Pecos, the credit union. - You wanna take a look Jim? - Anything beats this. - 121. - 121, go ahead. - We have your suspect robbery vehicle, Chevy Blazer. He ditched me, off the freeway at 272. - There he is, get that camera going! - Sky Four, we have a report of a pursuit in the area of Rocky Mountain Park. - Roger that, we're on top of it. - I want every car in there now. We'll set up a perimeter at Pecos, Coalfax, Federal, and I-70. - Stay with him, Jim. - Mike, this guy is dedicated at getting away, and I think he's gonna do it! Put me where I can get a tight shot, maybe we can ID him. - Hang on. - Is this the guy? - No. Wait a minute, yes. With a mustache. He came in here before, he passed a bad check. - Hutchinson. - Yeah. - [Dispatcher] All officers, suspect is confirmed to be Phillip Hutchinson, he is armed and considered dangerous. - Car 39 in pursuit, going north on Poe. He's gonna have to take 46. - Block it! - All officers converge on 46, all officers respond. - Car 39, suspect is turning east on 46. Repeat, east. - He wants that freeway. He's gotta come through here, if they don't stop him we will. - Spot, put that car in the slot, move it, move it! We got him trapped! - Car 23, suspect is through our position, turned north on Tennyson. - He's ours. - Bob, I know this punk. He'll hit us head on before he surrenders. We better bail outta here. Bob he's coming, get out, let's go! - The damn seat belt's stuck! - Bob! - Damn! Idiot! - Bob! Go get help! Go get help! - What kind of a person is that! He didn't even hit the brakes! - Where the hell are the cops! - If we hang on here, they'll see us. Lois, Sky Four. - Yes, Mike. - We don't have any channel that lets us talk directly to the cops. Call downtown, we're tracking this guy, he's on foot. Tell em to hone in on us. - Got it. - What's he talking about? - Hey! This is private property, get outta my yard! I'll call the police! He went there, around back! - Hurry up! - All officers, home in on the Channel Four helicopter, they are over the suspect. Repeat, they have the suspect. - Come, see if you can get a little closer! - Hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm talking to you! You got a pickup to make before you go anywhere! You don't and we're through! - Hey! Hey! Open the door! Open that door! Open the door bitch, come on! Come on open the door, what you wanna die! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Try and get lower, I still don't have a good ID shot. - Yes sir, the men are moving out now, keying on the helicopter. Right sir, over. Hold it! - A man! He shot at me! - Where? - Back, back at the apartments. - Alright just relax, it'll be alright. - Can somebody please call my father? - It'll be alright. - Don't be sad Punkin. Maybe our luck will change. - Hey old man, turn around. See what I got in my hand, this ain't no cap gun! Now get in that truck and start it, now! - It doesn't run. - That's not true. - It better run! Come on! - Alright, alright. My daughter's retarded, she doesn't understand. Don't hurt her. Let her go back into the house. - She ain't goin' no where! - Please, do it for me, please. I don't care about myself. Then I'll get the truck going. You go on back in the house, Punkin. - I said she ain't goin' no where, understand! - Go on Punkin! - Get in the truck. Come on! Move! Move it! Get in there! Start it up! - Check this out, here comes the calvary! - I want you to know I don't have any registration or insurance. - Just shut up! Move! Move it! Move it! - You better give this up right now! Police are comin'. I'll stop, you get out and put your hands up and everything'll be over. - You stop, you die! - Here they come! It's over! - No, he's in that truck! - No! What are you doing! - Stop! The truck! - Step on it! Move it! They ain't gonna catch me, understand! - If he gets onto Sheridan, this is gonna start all over again! The old man down there isn't gonna make it! - Whatever we have to do, Mike! - What're you doin'! Go around em, go around em! - No use, I told you! - Ram it! Ram it, I said ram it! - No you better give this up! - [Hutchinson] Ram it! - No! - Come on you wanna dance, you wanna party come on! - Hold it! Drop it! - Hold your fire, hold your fire! Get that man outta there! Come on let's move, move, move, move! - Clear, he's clear! - What's going on? - I don't know. - This is the biggest event ever, and we've got no footage! I've got nothing to put on the air! Tell em to get interviews. - Sky Four, Sky Four, can you read me? Mike, are you there? I can't get em on the line. - Get em back, get em back. - How are ya? - I guess I'm alright, I'm still in one piece. - I'm Mike Silva, I'm the helicopter pilot. - Oh my god, you're a hero boy! Thank you for saving my life. I thought I was a goner! - I was just doing my job, sir. This is Jim Stair, he photographed the whole thing. - I thank god you boys was up there, thank you. - Be seated. - On behalf of my mother, my wife, and my daughter, I would like to thank you for coming here today to honor my father. This isn't what he wanted. I don't think he'd mind, he loved his job. In the dictionary, beside the definition of a cop, there should be a picture of my dad. - I'm terrified. - I know. You'll make it. - [Counselor] I'm pleased to announce, our group has a new member. Would you stand, please? - Hi. I'm Gloria. - [Others] Hi Gloria. - I have a chemical dependency. When I'm through here, I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna have a baby. - I really don't know how to thank you all. This is one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. - It's just not gonna be the same with you gone. Absolutely. So what are you gonna be studying? - Accounting and business. It's a 12 month program, I'll have a degree in three years. - And then she's gonna come back as the boss! - No I won't! Well, I might. - You know. I really appreciated the valentine. - You did? - Yes, it really caught me by surprise. Well, good luck. - Hang on just a few more minutes folks, we got a big surprise! You guys okay? Almost there, Charlie! - Unusually warm and spring like day. The tragic consequences of Phillip Hutchinson's rampage, can perhaps be seen as only part of a larger mosaic. - No, no, no not such big words Laura, keep it simple. - Simple. - Simple, simple, simple. - Okay. The tragic outcome of Phillip Hutchinson's story? - Stair, where's your camera? - It's in the jeep, I didn't think it was time. - It's time! Get it, go, go, go! John, what do you see? - My goodness me. - What do you think of that, John? - [John] Ain't that something? - [Peter] And it's yours! It's a gift from us and the dealer and the people of Denver. - For me? - Yes, for you! - Special delivery, John. You're the hero. - Give him the keys to his car. - Here you go John. - Can she get in the truck? - She sure can, come on! - Now we go to the mountains? - Yes Punkin, we sure can. - Everybody over here for a little family portrait! Come on quick, quick! I've got a deadline to make! Could you two get up front, so you're right in the front of the photograph for me, please? That would be great, perfect! Maybe if you could get it right on the hood. Think you can do that? Alright, great! Now John, John! A big smile, everybody wave, everybody wave! So Silva, did you ever pass that exam? - Yes sir, I did. - You still want to be a weatherman? - Yeah. - You know you're the most famous helicopter pilot in America now, you don't think anybody's gonna give ya chance to do anything else, do you? - Yes sir, I do. - Yeah, you're probably right. - No one knows what caused Phillip Hutchinson to do the things he did or why the outcome is the way it is. What we do know is that the lives of those involved, especially those with whom he had direct contact, have been touched and will never again be the same. It is perhaps a consolation to consider that from the core of this tragedy, good has emerged. If only in the sense of community outrage, which rose up to accomplish the classic exchange of an eye for an eye.
