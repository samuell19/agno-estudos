I'll try reaching Mr. Kim again later. - But I can't... - You can do it kid. I'll try. Okay, bye. I'm looking for Officer Kim. - You're here regarding Kang Su-jin? - Yes. We still don't know who was driving. They were both found outside the car. It was a big accident. Ms. Kang was intoxicated at the time. But my wife doesn't drink. It's what the report says. You can check with the hospital later. Is this? No. Stop filming... Samchuk Hospital Hello? Design Sai. - Is this the main office? - Yes. I'm calling about Kang Su-jin. She's on vacation. Who's calling, please? Hello, sir. She was out here on business? Yes... I need to go to Seoul for a day or so. Try to have some more, Dad. Secret Code Give me. Look, In-su. I understand, but... The production isn't happy with you running out on last nights show. Just take some time off. Okay. Sam-heung Motel Excuse me? Yes? What is it? Was your husband really here on business? - Yes, that's right. - My wife was on vacation. But I said she was here on a side job. I think you should say the same. Samchuk Hospital What are you doing? Have you had a lot of stress recently? Yes... Hello. Do you want something strong or mild? Something that works well. $2 please. Don't take more than one a day. How may I help you? Here you are. Thank you. Do you need anything in particular? Yes. I'm having trouble sleeping. I have something to ask you. And something to return to you. How did you find out? I read the messages on her phone. And you? I read his messages, too. And the camera wasn't my husbands. Excuse me... This may sound weird but... Could I read your husband's messages? Let's go away together. Can you take time off? YOON Kyung-ho I'm worn out from last night. KANG Su-jin - I'm filming us now... - Don't. Stop filming... Don't tickle me. Maybe you should've just died. Hey. - How've you been, sir? - Okay... - Did you eat? - No. Then let's go eat. - Are you staying the night? - No, there's a concert tomorrow. That?s right... Gwang-il... When I saw Su-jin at the hospital, I wished that I'd been hurt instead. Don't worry. She'll be fine. Right... So, how are things with your wife? Good, I guess... You think I'm pathetic, don't you? No. Yeah, right... Gwang-il... Just leave... Just leave... Sorry, man. Just go. Please just go. Bastard. Hey. Please... Open the door. Please, I need to talk to you. Hey... I... uhm... I'd like to apologize. I'm very sorry. - Oh, hello. - Hello. Have a seat. It won't be easy settling with them. The victim was so young. Since we don't know who was driving yet... It'd be best if you both went to his funeral. Do you want to wait here? Are you friends of Young-ki? No, the husband of the one in the accident. I am very sorry. Mother... Who are you? - I'm very sorry. - I'm very sorry. I'm the wife of the one who caused the accident. You bitch! Bring back my brother! Bring my brother back! Bastard! Stop it! Just go. Please, just go. I'm begging you. Just leave. Please, go. Please just leave. Please stop the car. Sleep well. One, two, three. Why'd you have to do it, Su-jin? I just don't get it. # Throw away the sadness. Good-bye! # Life is beautiful. Singing! # Throw away the sadness! Would you like to try? Are you an athlete? Why do you ask? Back there when you were throwing... Oh, that. No, I'm a lighting director for stages. - Like at concerts. - That sounds like fun. It is when I'm setting it up, but it seems so futile afterwards. But it's still fun when you're setting up, right? I guess. What do you do? Housework and chores. That's a hard job. Thank you for saying that... How did the two of you meet? She came to take concert pictures during college. My wife used to be in a photography club. What university did she go to? Joong-ang University. Then, they must've been in the same club. - Would you like some more? - I'll have the beer. When do you feel happy? - When I sleep? - Me, too. That hit the spot. How did you two meet? After I graduated, My dad told me to get married early. He set us up to meet. Things were so good then... But I guess career women are more attractive. No, not really. I wish this was all a dream. A dream... I don't know what I did wrong. I hope he comes out of the coma. So I can at least get an explanation. What will you do when she wakes up? Get revenge. Should we have an affair? That'd make them flip. I need to get some air. Here you are. Finished already? Yes. - Have some more. - It's okay. Come in. Hello. - Have you eaten? - Yes. - So you're going to Seoul? - Yes, for a few days. I see. - Please take good care of her. - Sure. - Hello. - Hi. - Are things going okay? - Yes. - I knew you could do it. - Thanks. Let's take it from the top. Raise up the MR. Please. Okay. Do you like to walk? Yes, I do. Do you? I do, too. Doesn't it feel weird meeting in Seoul? Aren't you cold? Yes, aren't you? Just a little. Should we go back? We came pretty far. If you?re cold, should we run? Please don't let it die. I'll take good care of it. So, what should we do today? What would you like to do? Are you always this quiet? What's your favorite season? Spring. What about you, In-su? Well... I like winter. I like the snow, too. Then, I guess it should snow in spring. Think that'd ever happen? Want to take a picture? Never mind. Sure, why not? - Look here? - Yes. One, two, three... Here, let me do it. - Who is it? - It's your father-in-law, son. - Yes, sir. Just a moment. - Okay. Hello, sir. I didn't know you were coming. - Holding up okay? - Yes. - Ah... did you eat? - No, not yet. I was just on my way out for dinner. Wait here. - Did you stop by the hospital? - Yes. - Su-jin looks a lot better. - She does. Ah, Dad? I think I forgot to lock the door. - I'll wait downstairs. - I'll be right down. I'm okay. Hello? Yes, I'll be right there. Su-jin. Su-jin. It might take a few weeks for the patient to talk. You said you'd be back late. - Thank you. I'll take it from here. - Okay. I almost forgot, his blood pressure went down this afternoon. Thank you... There is no big change in his vital signs... But his bodily functions are weakening. Do you want to transfer him to a bigger hospital in Seoul or stay? What should I do, doctor? It's up to you to decide. What about the woman in the accident with him? She'll be transferred to Seoul. I see. You must be happy. Now you can both go back to Seoul. Want to go out to eat? Not really. I'll wait. I must be out of my mind. If we... met long ago or much later, what would we be? What will become of us? Yes, it's me. No. Something came up. I can't make it back tonight. Is everything okay? How's his blood pressure? I see... But something came up today. I can't make it back. I'll be there first thing in the morning. Please take good care of him. Bye. 4, 7, 8, 9... 20. ...40. Square that all up and it comes to 160 points. Are you sure? Count it up again. It's right. Look, 3, 4. It's 7. 7, 8... He passed away at 3:23 p.m. Would you like to go in and see him? Funeral Home Room No. 301 The departed saint - YOON Kyung-ho The chief mourner - HANG Seo-young Honey, I want a cigarette. Are you okay to smoke? Thank you, In-su... For what? For everything. Last bus to Seoul! - Seoul! - Where are you going? Seoul! Last call to Seoul! Seoul! Seoul! Last call to Seoul! Thank you. In-su, isn't there something you want to ask me? How long are you going to hold it back? At first, I wanted to know... But not anymore. Su-jin... He died. - Gwang-il. - Yes? - Check on the bank. - Right on it, sir! - Good. - Okay. A great snow squall is falling far into spring. Tae-Baek Mts were about to embrace the spring warmth but it seems he has decided to hibernate again. The spring flowers are being helplessly buried in the snow... Where should we go? Where would you like?
