"I Don't Give A Damn." You know what? I don't mind busting my ass, running 100 kilometers, just not to pass the army without doing anything. -Next you'll say you're going to the army to contribute something to the country. -You know what? Yes. No, wait, wait, wait a second. The army needs fighters, if we can be fighters why shouldn't we go? -Right. Wait, and if I go to the academic reserve I don't contribute? No. -No, really, if I study medicine it isn't contributing? Shut up. You and Raffi are going to the army for your personal pride, not for anyone else. Oh, come on. -For your pride, - to show off. - I don't feel the country has done - so much for me. - What's your story? -It's not 48', not the forming of the state. I don't mind contributing, but I want it to be interesting, so I'll get something out of it. - Say you're religious, it'll be O.K. - Anyway, I think that drafting girls is a waste, what do you need it for? Stay at home, - knit something. -Son of a bitch. - The truth, he has a point. No, just a second, Taly, listen, there's a war every 10-12 years. A while ago there was a war. Now we're good for several years. What war, war, you think you could stand in front of a person and kill him? -You're asking me? War is war, it sucks. But I don't want to sit on the side while some terrorists come into a kibbutz and kill children. Yes. And you know what scares me? I'm afraid that we'll have to face some ninety year old man and decide whether to pull the trigger or not. That I will see kids getting their heads blown up and stay indifferent. I want to grow up, but I don't want to change. Everyone inside the house step outside. Get out. Forward, attack. - What's the matter, talk to me! - Call the helicopter. Call the helicopter get the rescue team, the helicopter. It hurts. -Arik, raise the head, raise the I.V. What's up with the helicopter? Helicopter! Raise your head. Take your hand out take your hand out. - Where does it hurt, Raffi? - In the stomach. Raise the stretcher. Slowly, carefully. Slowly. Calm down! -Talk to me, Raffi. Come on, come on, raise the I.V. Raise the stretcher. Slowly! Raise the I.V. Talk to me, talk to me. Go, go. Raffi! Raffi! I had such wonderful plans for the summer before joining the army. Fuck it, I said, before I go to get killed I deserve at least one summer of fun, no? A whole month I went crazy with my best friend. Sea, girls, discos, music, what's wrong, isn't it reasonable for an eighteen year old to want, like they say, to drink life to its fullest before he goes to the army? Everything in life happens to me at the last minute. The most beautiful and the worst. That's my luck, what can I do? Even Nira I met at the last minute. Twelve hours before the army she suddenly entered my life. To the sea. -I usually don't pick up girls in the middle of the street. It's not that I'm shy, but it's awkward. I guess something was special about her. She did what she liked. No problems, no inhibitions, spontaneously. That's what I liked so much. It's fun. - What did you say your name was? - Raffi. Your shirt is wet. When I saw her under the hose, I wanted that nothing would happen. At least not the first time. I know it sounds childish but I really didn't want a nice start to end fast. I wanted it to go on and on. When I was a kid I always left the best candy for last, for later. Do you have a toilet here? What a mind. - Where are you going? -Paratroopers. - What else. Scared? At a prom in school, someone said to me see you on a memory board. Really funny. -No, look, statistically there's a good chance we'll end up, either in the ground or in a hospital. -Stop it. Once we had a draw what will happen, one stepped on a mine in Nablus, - one was shot by a burst in the chest. - Raffi. -I died in service in Tal... - One, two, there, we're done. -The ear. - There, the ear is in place. Now, come on, look. Where did you learn to cut hair like this? I told you, I'm learning to draw. I don't believe it, now you're getting a haircut? -Yigal. This is Yigal. -Who's this? I'm Nira. -Hello Nira. Watch out for him, he's dangerous. Let's go, army. -Let's go. I had such luck to go with Nira. I wouldn't have survived basic if she hadn't been there for me. That she exists for me. Now, after everything it's strange to me, but then we still believed in the: "there's no choice", red beret, paratrooper shoes. I also used to be like that. - And this is my hair with keys. - Come on, we're out of here. Bye Nira. Bye. -Bye. Wear a sweater so you don't catch a cold. Volunteer to paratroopers... Volunteer to paratroopers, bastard. 'Cause the other infantry only take on pussies volunteer to paratroopers, bastard. Volunteer to paratroopers, bastard. Volunteer to paratroopers, bastard. Fire! First time I sleep in your bed. Strange. We almost didn't talk, seems like we've known each other half our lives. What was it? Your look. Your silence. Your touch. You touched me. You touched me, didn't you. I dreamt this in our bed, in which we haven't slept together yet. You won't believe it but it's good here. Hard but good. You return from a hike with stretchers forty km., shoulder busted, falling down, dying to sleep, I don't know, it's great. From dawn to night you run and shoot, crawl and shoot, jump and shoot, fall asleep and shoot. I've never slept so good, like here in the army. First thing in the morning, 4 o'clock, up on your feet in twenty seconds. I couldn't take it alone. But all the guys here are great. Real friendship, only here. I'm so high that sometimes I don't know who I love more, this one unit, or you, the only one. What does she have to write to you so much about? I find you in the sentences you mark in the books I found here. I find you? I find you? - I find you? - Let it go. What with the heaviness, movie, bar, to bed and home, what's doing? Five A.M. the clock rings, I don't know where I am, I reach out, can't find her in bed, are you listening? I look by the bed, I see her sitting and drawing me sleeping. For an hour. Love. -So what, are you printing invitations? Stop it. No, let go, I'm ticklish, let go. In love, hey? Nira, Nira. Nira. When we finally got a vacation, first thing I ran to the room. But Nira wasn't there. She wasn't in the room, But she was still there. Everywhere. Such surprises. I've got to admit, home is home. The shower I dreamed of, my Mom's pudding, against the mud in the army. Mom enjoys my appetite, Elly got on my nerves as usual with. "This is nothing, when I was in the army..." Then came Dad's stories about his wars. In short, a typical evening in the Levin family house. Only in my head all the time there was Nira. How come I didn't ask her where her parents lived? Maya, my dear brother's wife. The only person in the family, I can talk with about everything. Always understands what I mean, even when I say the opposite. A great girl, with an open mind. - O.K. I'm in love. - Again? This time it's serious, really. Stop it, come on, don't laugh at me. I'm... -Suffering. - When did you have time? - It was short, fast but lethal. Every time I think of her I feel a twinge, croaks, butterflies... - That's love, isn't it? - I see the real party is here. You have a phone call. -Me? Where are you? -In bed thinking of you. -You're in the room? - Why didn't you call? - I thought you're at your parents. How long will it take you to get here? -Ten minutes. Raffi, stop it, I'm counting to a hundred. One, two, three, four, five, six. Seventy one, seventy two, seventy three, seventy four, seventy nine, eighty nine, ninety. Ninety one, Ninety two, ninety three, ninety four, ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven... Ninety nine, one hundred. Someone once told me that love starts where the words end. Then I just thought it's a nice phrase, but it's true. I didn't go to my parents, I didn't call friends, just me and Nira, and Nira and I, and both of us, all the time. In the eyes, the hands, the lips. In everything. Hi, I'm Nira. You're growing too fast for me, son. Suddenly the army, a girlfriend, wait a little. Days, weeks, when I was in love with the army almost as much as with Nira. I remember our first encounter. Mine and Yigal's, in combat. Encounter with blood. Raffi! There's more mines there. Leave the gun, come on! Raffi, Yigal, slowly. Careful on the leg. Beneath the shoulders, bring him to me, on your footprints, very good, slowly, don't hurry, careful on the leg. - Lay him down here. - Rescue, six four two. Rescue six four two, I repeat, six four two over. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen! Can't get it out of my head. A moment before there was a whole person in a second a mess of blood. It irritates you that I talk about it all the time. -No. I couldn't move, I was shocked. Yigal, without thinking much, grabbed him, dragged him to the doc like it was a drill or something. Never in my life did I see so much blood. I'm such a dork, you were having so much fun until I came here. - I shouldn't have come. - Yes you should. I want you Raffi, with the good and with the shit. All right. Let's go home. Who's driving? - I don't believe it. - First time around, baby. I don't believe it. I'm so crazy about you. Wait, wait. Wait, wait a moment, come on, get on. Raffi. Raffi. - When did you get up? -Earlier. - Couldn't sleep? You? -I'm cold. -Come here. I forgot to tell you, I got a postponement for the service. - How long? - Until I finish my studies. What? -Nothing. Hold me. On your next vacation we'll take the bike, go down to Eilat, find a place there with no one else. Just you and me. O.K? That's it, actually. I have nothing more to tell. My story ends here, in the hospital. The story's finished. I'm finished. Everything's finished. Maybe. Raffi, how do you feel? What's going on? You were unconscious for five hours. -What? I'm hot. -Lie down, lie down. Yigal is here. -Hey, stud. Raffi. Tell me, Ruthy, what exactly is Raffi's condition? We can't know anything at this stage. Seven days and you don't know anything? - Why doesn't he react to anything? - Didn't you speak to the doctors? We did, but they won't tell us anything. Look, Ruthy, I don't want to be a nag, but with your experience. - Good morning. -Good morning. - I brought you a new friend, - Raffi, meet Gill. - Hey. -Ammy. And here's Roni. All right? O.K. bye. - Hello, anyone wants coffee, tea? - Hello baby, new? What's your name? -Sarit. Sarit, honey, will you do me a favor? - Yes, why not? - There's a knob here on the bed, could you perhaps turn it? Yes, yes, here. That's it, down here. - Take your hand off me. - Take it off, here you go. One, two, three and... "He has a severed hand below the joint" "and a hand severed above the joint, he has a hand severed "above the joint and two torn to the shoulder. "He has a severed leg under the knee and a severed leg above the knee, "he has a torn leg above the knee and two severed" "below." - Excuse me. -Yes. - Could you do me a favor? Sure, what's the problem? -The bed here, there's a knob down there. Where? -Yes. -Yes, well? -Is it all right that I put my hand on you? If it makes you feel good, then it's all right. - I can take it off if you like. - Then take it off. Hey, come here. - It's mine, mine. - Wait a minute. Raffi, we're getting up today for the first time. Smile. Come, first thing we'll put the legs down. All right? Come, give me your hand help me out a little. Up, good. Look at me, look at me, - cross your hands and we go over. - One, two three. - All right, Raffi? - I can't feel I'm sitting. I'm dizzy, I'm dizzy. Release the brakes, Watch what I'm doing, all right? I'm dizzy. -Take a deep breath, give me a smile. - Good. Better? - I want back to bed. So wait a moment, I'll lean you back a little on me, - you'll feel much better. - I don't feel anything. I'll take you back a little you'll feel better. - Come, put your head on me. - I want back to bed. Just a minute, we'll sit some more. Take a deep breath, have a look. - Good, give me a smile. - I want back to bed. What have we got? - Good morning. -Good morning. - How are we doing today? Come, take a deep breath, once more. - Doctor I want to talk to you. - O.K. Yes, I'm with you, how can I help you? Doctor I want you to tell me the truth. - The truth is this, Raffi... - Will I be able to walk? It's been 3 months since your injury, and hasn't been a change, neurological or functional. Sorry, but you won't have use of your legs. What about fucking? -The answer is yes. In certain conditions, like I said you won't enjoy it. It will be more difficult than before. - Yes or no? - It's individual, but obviously won't be like before. Thank you very much. You have guests, good bye. Good morning. -Hello. - How are doing, kid? - I brought you something you like. This came in the mail today, your matriculation tests results. - Want to see? -Go away. - Your father and I thought, Registration to university is now, should we sign you up? -Go away! What's going to happen, Maya? What's going to happen? Yes, Meir's I.V.P from yesterday. I'm aware of the load, obviously. Did you find it? Can you read it and also order three zistographies? Yes, thank you. Pretzles, sweet Pretzles, Pretzles with sesamee, do you want a pretzle? Here you go, a kiss. Another one, a ride, a ride. Thank you, right here, hello? A pretzle, a kiss. A red pretzle? A pretzle? No! A serenade for my sir. A dollar. No need, a pretzle. Wow, another one. Mister, do you want a balloon? No? A heart. A heart here. - Hello Raffi. How do you feel? - Not how, what. Everything except for the legs. I even feel what you're feeling. - What am I feeling? - What you've decided to feel. All the shit that you feel when you stand next to a rag. Good morning. Bon appetit. Good morning, Raffi, I came to change your bandages. Do you want a pretzle? No, thank you. I'll wait outside, Raffi. -Why, Ilana doesn't mind you staying, - right Ilana? -No. - And I'd love you to stay. - Be a man, Raffi. - Half a man, - that's the best I can do. Come here. - No, stop it. -Come here, take a look - for once, take a look. -Stop it! - Beautiful, isn't it? -Stop it! - Watch. Isn't it beautiful? -Stop! - It's beautiful? -Stop it! -Lovely? Enough! You know you're crazy? - It's all right, it's all right. - I'm sorry. -It's all right. My keys. Get the keys. Come sit here, sit here. Sit, sit on the bench. - My keys! -All right. - My keys, give me them. Are you all right? Here are the keys. Are you calm? You know you're a son of a bitch? Look how you treat her. Do you know, Roni, what happens to a lizard when you cut off a leg? You don't deserve a girl like Nira. In a month the bitch grows a new one. Good. -Good. Look at the lizard. Doesn't hear music, doesn't read books, Keeps a low profile. But what? You'll never catch it in a wheel chair. Raffi? -In the next life. Nira asked me to give you this. "The Angel." Thank you. What do you want, a tip? She wasn't in such good shape, you know? Fate is cruel to some people. - I'm Amnon. - Good. I'm sure you're full of good intentions, but you can stick them up your ass. So roll out and let me sleep. What's so funny, cripple? How's it going, kid? Is everything all right? -Just great. What are you doing here? - I want to talk to you. - What's with you, Elly? Let's go for a walk? Listen carefully, I have a great idea. I've thought about it a lot, I'm sure you'll love it. You remember Eitan? Eitan the red-head, - my doctor from the regiment? -Yes. - He's in Boston. -So what? He works in a hospital, he runs a neurosurgical department, among the best in the world. I've talked to him. He's waiting for us. I have tickets, we board a plane on Tuesday. What do you say? -Come on, I don't know yet what's happening with me, - don't push, Elly, all right? - Raffi, we're wasting time, let's go for a week, two weeks, to Boston, see what happens. - I'm not going anywhere now, Elly. - Raffi, don't be a prick. We're going and that's it. No matter the cost. -Elly, lay off. - Raffi, let us help you. - No one can help me. Roni? - Roni? - What? - Quick, call a nurse. - What's the matter? I can feel my legs, Roni. I can feel my legs. Will you call the nurse? Nurse! Nurse! Yes, Raffi. -Well, I feel some currents in my legs all the time. I can really feel the legs. Call a doctor, I can feel the legs. Call a doctor, all right? - Come on, call a doctor. - All right. What do you feel? I feel my legs, dork, I feel my legs. -Do you want me to bring you anything? -Adidas shoes. Here you are, doctor. - What's the problem? - I can feel my legs. Shut your eyes. And tell me if you feel anything. This is the first time this happened to me. Good. Good. What's good? Does it mean it's coming back? -It's all right. Give him five milligrams Valium. Go to sleep now. Wait, what's this? Who's this idiot? Go to sleep, it's almost morning, Raffi. Tova, I can feel my legs. You too, Roni. Good night. Son of a bitch fooling me. Everyone's fooling me. Roni, bring me a pin or needle. - Bring me your syringe. - What do you need it for? Get me the syringe. Raffi. - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. Who told you to come here? - What's the matter? - What's the matter? Once I knew a Nira who would look me in the eyes, and say the whole truth. Say: Raffi, you're a cripple, a poor thing and I feel sorry for you. Can you even say the word: Cripple? I love you just like before. What exactly do you love? This thing sitting in a wheel chair? It doesn't matter. You haven't changed. -I haven't changed. I've touched death, Nira. It grabbed me by the balls. - I just barely escaped from it. - But you're alive. I want you the way you are. You know what I dream of at night? About the fucks we had. On the mattress on the roof. I can't forget them. Neither can I. -Did you ever think how it will be like from now on? Lift my legs a little. Move the right one a little to the side, now lay on top of me. Is it good for you? Do you feel anything? I don't feel a thing. -But that's not the most important thing. You think so. It's not so important when it's all right, but there's nothing more important in the world when it's not all right. - We haven't tried yet. - No miracle will happen, Nira. - I'm not waiting for miracles. - So what do you want? To hell with it, Nira, what do you want from me? Do you want to marry me? Do you want to bear my children? It's possible. Perhaps, but not with you. -Why? Because I'm willing, maybe, to marry a woman who knows me like I am. Half dead. Our story is over, Nira. Dead. - When did you decide all this? - When I woke up. - Why did you wait until now? - I don't know. I thought it would come from you, but that didn't happen. - It's hard for you, you feel awkward. - You're wrong, Raffi, it's not true. - I really love you. - Enough! Go away, Nira, I'm asking you. - Don't come back anymore. - I can't. I don't love you anymore don't you get it? I can't stand to see your stares, I can't stand to see your health. I can't stand to see your legs. Get out of my life, Nira! You're a cripple, Raffi. Now I know, you're a cripple. You're a cripple, a cripple! A cripple! Whores. They're all whores I tell you. Just fuck them and give them kids. All the rest is a big showoff. She'll talk to you about philosophy and about literature, but in her head she just wants you to fuck her three times a day. If you don't have a dick she won't look at you, maximum pity you. If you fuck it's a sign you exist. Leave it, leave it. Dad, bring me the knob of the thing. -Yes, here. Elly, lean me back. Lean back, wait, move, move. Put this here. Dad, hold from beneath. Lift, slowly, one at a time. Slowly, careful. One at a time. Hold from beneath. -Lean me back more. Lean me more. - That's it, turn me around. - Slowly, slowly. Again. Wait, wait, just a minute. I have a better idea. - Put it down, Dad, put it down. -Why? - Listen to me, put the carriage down. - What are you doing? - Put the carriage down. - Dad, hold this. -Elly. - Come, I'll carry you. No, Elly. -Come on. -Elly, no, Elly, no. -There. -Elly. Elly don't. No. Where are you going, Raffi? Where to? -I'm not hungry. Leave me alone, Elly. It's not simple. It's not simple. It would be much more simple if you left him alone. What did I do wrong? -Nothing. You carry him on your arms like a baby, everyone's sitting here looking at him like a helpless creature. How do you want him to feel? It will be all right, son. In the new house we'll be together a lot. A great house. You'll like it. Quiet environment. We'll live on the second floor and you downstairs. Five big rooms. Two bathrooms, The entrance is the same height as the sidewalk. No stairs at all. If you want to go somewhere then me or Mom will take you, in the car, whenever you like, wherever you like. It will be O.K. Raffi. I want to go back to rehabilitation. - To the hospital. Now. - Why, Raffi? You're at home now, tomorrow is Saturday, I thought we could go somewhere. I hate this house. I don't want to be here any more. Dad? Dad! Dad. Dad what have you done? Dad get up. Dad get up, you hear me? Get up. What have you done? Get up Dad, help me. Get up, you hear me? Dad answer me, get up. Dad stand up, help me help me, dad help me. Come on Dad. Walk, Dad, walk. Dad throw up. Dad throw up. If we hadn't got there on time... Oh my god. What would I have told Raffi, your Dad killed himself because you're... I'm choking. How do you have the strength? We don't. But we can't let Raffi know that. Nothing will help. He hates this house, he hates us. -What do you expect, that he'll dance from happiness? He's sick, we're healthy, We have to believe that one day... How many times did the doctors have to tell you this? Even doctors make mistakes sometimes, they're only humans, - I'm sure of it, I can feel it. - Who are you trying to fool? I'm not willing to give up and tell myself, that's it, my kid will stay in a chair all his life. What do you want me to kill myself too? We're just at the beginning, there are other doctors, there are new methods, we're in the twentieth century. We're at the end of the twentieth century. -When will you understand that he's a cripple and that's it? Hello, stud. -Hello, Rambo. - You're still alive? - What's up? They're asking when you're coming back. -In a week or two. - You know I was here on Sunday? - What's new in the company? Good, actually we got a great cycle. What's with these sideburns? What are you Elvis? - I'm repenting. - How's Nira? -All right. What all right, are you trying to fool me? - How's the fucking? - Great, and for you? I can't figure out what they find in you, Yigal. I can't figure out what I find in you, Raffi. I got the results of the matriculation tests. Seven point two, bastards. I was sure I have at least seven nine. So you're going to university? No. At least not for the next couple of years. -Why? I received a summons for officer's training. So I'm probably going to sign up. - Doesn't it seem stupid to you? - What? -Signing. Well, I've got to go. I found this in your overcoat. Take care. How's it going? Come on. Almost fifteen years and it's still hard. - Yom-Kippur? - The Chinese Farm, I was in New-York in the middle of school. -What were you studying? Architecture. You're an architect? -Wanted to be. And what are you doing here? Urologic repairs. Are you married? Take the picture... I've spoken to Elly. He also thinks it's a good idea for you to come live at our house. It won't work, Maya. It won't work. Don't argue, you know I'm right. For you. Just a kid. I can't fall asleep at night without hearing the cries of the wounded and she talks to me about love. You know what? The truth is that I think only of love, and she thinks only about the wounded. Raise your hand. Hey. - Congratulations. -What? - The chair. -Yes. Thank you. Is he crazy or what? - Angry? - So am I. Sorry. - What was that supposed to be? - I don't know. Can't help myself. I have a whole mess inside, he has nothing, nothing at all. What do you want? For the whole world to stop and mourn? Quit stepping over everyone, grow up. Give us a chance, Raffi. -Perhaps I should look for another flat. Don't be silly. -I'll go back to rehabilitation till they find a place. Out of the question. -I'm not good. I shouldn't be with healthy people, don't you get it? -It's not true, you know that very well. Congratulations. Well? -It pays to be a cripple. Elly, could you help me with the chair, I can't reach the brakes with my leg. -You piece of shit. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? He'll ruin the engine. Raffi, so, you're still taking these pictures? - Prosthesis, cripples and that's it? - What can I do? What's going on with you? -I get up at five A.M, eat something, quarrel with my brother a little, take the car, get laid, a hell of a life. -Speaking of getting laid what's going on with Nira? Nira? Nira, I've heard that name somewhere. Why don't you come over some time? We'll eat something and chat. Do you like fish, grilled? -I don't believe it. -What's the matter? No, I don't believe it. You work, play basketball, and cook, a perfect woman. -So it's a date? We'll see. Yigal. -Raffi. -What are you doing here in the middle of the day? Don't I deserve a vacation sometimes, what's up with you? All right, do you have time for coffee? Sure, only I promised... Meet Raffi. Roniti. -You haven't changed. - We're on the way to the beach. - Hop in, I'll drop you off. Get in. - I thought about you this week. - I've been planning to visit you for several days, but it doesn't work out. -No, I know you're very busy. The truth, officers' training is fun after basic and our commanders. - Last week... -What do you do, Ronit? - I dance. - What, discotheques or for real? - No, a real dancer, - Swan Lake and the sorts. - So give her my number call me sometime we'll go dancing together. Say, do you still live with your brother? -So is it a date, Ronit? Pull over a moment, I want to buy cigarettes. - O.K, we'll walk from here. - Is she a good lay? Are you all right, Raffi? -Never been better, why? -Are you angry? No way, because you disappeared for three months, why should I be angry? Go on, you shouldn't miss getting laid. -Wait a minute, all right? After every fucking I have, I come to you first thing, - even before I see my parents. - Yigal do me a favor. -Shut up, for once listen to me damn it, what's wrong with you? What happened, Raffi? I come here, want you to give a hand, so we'll get out of this mess. Yigal, remember? But you don't let me in on anything, you don't care. I come over, want you to give a hand, say something, what's the matter? I'm doing something wrong, so tell me! I love you, Raffi. Nira? I was in the neighborhood, I waited for you to come out. It's nice here. Is it all yours? -No. Do you always stay so late? Sometimes. How's he doing? - What happened, Nira? - Don't you know? Why didn't you come to us, we would have helped you. - It wasn't up to me. - You love him, don't you? Very much. -So why do you leave in the hardest moment? Wait, I think you don't understand. Now of all times, how can you do this to him? I didn't leave him, he sent me away. - That can't be. - I wanted to stay, - but he threw me out. - Maybe he was angry. - He gets upset so quickly. - He wasn't angry. He spoke with reason, quietly. He explained to me very nice why he doesn't want me. Nira, try again, go to him. Stop it. It's hard enough as it is. You piece of... how do you drive, tell me, how do you drive? Are you crazy? -It slipped. Now hear, listen to me, listen to me, it can't go on like this, - Raffi, we have to talk. - There's nothing to talk about, Give me the bill, the army is paying. You're going to talk to me now. Raffi, Raffi. Raffi, Raffi listen, listen, I bust my ass all day at work, Dad, as you know, doesn't help me that much. I come home and you start. What's wrong with you? Nothing. -I can't reach you, you've locked yourself up. What's going on with you? Let me in. Tell me why you can't talk to me like you talk to Maya? What do you hold against me? Tell me, are you testing me? You've turned this house into a... look. What's this supposed to be? - A person has to have a hobby, no? - You're sick! You're sick! Tell me, what's this museum? Why do you surround yourself with photos of cripples. -It bothers you? It bothers you that people have paid so you could fill your house - with video machines and stuff. - You're out of your mind. You've lost your mind. You've lost your mind. What do you think, that you have a monopoly over the crippled. I didn't go to the army? I didn't go through a war? Tell me, do you think we fired caps? I had a very good chance to get killed. But I wouldn't want my pictures to hang on the walls of houses or on pages of albums. Or for people to think about me all day. I'd like them to go on living, drinking, eating, cheating income tax, cheating on their wife a little. To keep living their fucking lives. Quietly. I would like to be forgotten. Then forget me too. -You're my brother, my brother, you dork! If you were in my place you wouldn't talk like that. Hi Raffi, come on in. How beautiful. Some house. -The fish are on the grill. Drink coffee? Architecture, hey? All in all it's a drop in the quality of life. To five feet. Spicy? -Feel free. You know what, Raffi? What you actually need is a good fuck. I love your psychological approach. Don't you know it's not nice to make fun of cripples? Pour. What are you doing? Ruthy? Hi, it's Amnon, great. Say, can you swing by? With Maly, super. Bye. What's that, do you pimp on the side? Shall we eat? Take the wine. So this is your solution for sex life when you're a cripple? You won't believe it. I'm hard. Come quick before the miracle ends. I don't have regular relations any more. Normal? You mean normal, normal. What do you want me to tell you, it's not like before the injury. But the fact that someone's in bed with you, is already something. And weren't there some that dumped you just because you're a cripple? There were. But they're not worth talking about. What, do yo want me to tell you I didn't have hard times? I had. But today I know how to read love, mind you. Fucking is no longer the stock I sell. Amnon, do me a favor, call this Ruthy, call the whole thing off, will you? - What is it, what's the matter? - I don't feel like it. Aren't you dying to try? You're afraid. What's the matter, can't you get a hard on? - How long? - Since the injury. -Normal. - Normal? Yes. - A nineteen year old guy, who doesn't get a hard on for half a year seems normal to you? -Yes. O.K. look, it will be a bit like the first time. It won't be good, but after you do it you could say I did it, O.K? Good evening, girls. -How are you doing? -Super. -How are you? Ruthy, Mali, Raffi. Are you hungry? -I'm starving. - The taxi is waiting for money. - I'll pay, I've got money. Good morning. -Bright morning. You came back late last night. Where were you? -In an orgy of cripples. - Since when are you sitting here? - I had time to drink a black coffee - with my dear brother. - You didn't fight I hope. Heaven forbid. We have mutual respect. Do you like my legs? Not bad. Want to take my picture? You know I take pictures only of the crippled and dead. Why don't you try something else for once? O.K. Let's see what you can give me. Good. Yes, come. No, that's too close. Walk back a little, I don't have focus. Lick your lips. Why don't you ever come to me in my dreams, Maya? I do come, but there's no room. It's full of prosthesis there. I'm out of film. Hello? "This is Adi Talmor in the news room of Galei Tzahal (army radio). "The army spokesman has just released the name of the officer "who was killed yesterday during a terrorist attack. The officer is. "Second-Lieutenant Yigal Charish age twenty one from Tel-Aviv. Second Lieutenant Yigal Charish burial is today at 4 o'clock pm." Hello, Raffi. -Hello, Nira. - I'll make coffee. - Want me to help you? -No. Leave it, leave it, it's all right. - So what's the deal. - I wanted to talk to you. -Talk. I don't know how to begin. From the end. That's the hardest to do. Then start from the beginning. From the beginning? About a year ago I was standing at the corner of Arlozorov - and waiting for a ride. - Oh, come on. - Don't you ever regret it? - Regret what? -Telling me to leave. Sometimes. But all in all I think there was no choice. - Why don't you tell me the truth? - What truth? That you no longer love me. - It's not exactly like that? - Then why did you throw me out? What was it that I threatened? Why was it easy for you to receive pity from a nurse who changed your underwear, and not from me? Because I had to help you in bed? With the sex? The fucking? Is that so awful? Answer me. Are you here? I'm here. How do you feel? Like shit. -Why? It was great. - I didn't feel anything. - But it's possible, you can do it. - Leave me alone. - Raffi. -Enough! Raffi. I'm getting married at the end of the month. - Why did you come here? - I wanted you. I wanted to see if it was possible, I'm glad it happened. Nira, do me a favor, get out of my life and close the door. I'm going to get married now. You know why? Because it's the most decent thing I can do. What do you want me to do, hold your bouquet? Will you finally tell me what you want? I want to die. And I want to live, you understand? Always like this? It's really late already. Could he be with friends at such a... Nice of you to come. We were getting worried. You look much better. He looks much more calm, right Mordechai? - We were just talking about you. - I was at the cemetery. I was telling mother I think you should study something. You shouldn't waste the time. Or come into the business with me, - I need help at the store. - The store doesn't interest me, Dad. Is it a disgrace to work in the store? -I'm taking pictures. Take pictures. Who stops you from doing both? Enough. I don't want to talk about it any more. It's much better like this. It's good that you shaved. You can be a little nicer. - Leave him alone, Elly. - You stay out of it. Stop justifying him for every infantile thing he does. - I'll do whatever I want. - Yes. Even pose for him naked? - You're so stupid. - I'm stupid, why? Because I'm trying to preserve my parents' dignity? Raffi, look what I found in the paper. I cut it specially for you. In a meeting of the Reverend Billygram in Atlanta, a cripple rose - from a wheel chair and walked. - You believe in this nonsense, Mom? Ten-thousand people saw it. It's a fact. Would you be a little more optimistic? -Maybe you're right. - Maybe I should want more. - Of course, Raffi. If you only tell yourself all the time I can. I really can. I'll walk because I want and I believe. -Yes. Now. -Yes. - What are you doing, Raffi? - I can walk. It's all a matter of will. Let me go! He got out of the chair and started walking ten-thousand people saw it. You're not the only cripple in the world, Raffi. Why do you abuse us? Why do you make our lives so bitter? You don't want to be at home, you don't have to. What's wrong with Elly? Yes, cry some, cry some, you moron. - Shut up. -She's stupid. - Shut up. -Elly! I don't want him in my house any more. I want him to go away and return to the hospital. I don't want him. He isn't going anywhere. -Tomorrow morning he's getting out of here. It's lost. It's all lost. Amnon? Amnon? What's the matter? -Ten-thousand people saw him stand up you understand, ten-thousand people saw him. They are all crazy. Totally crazy. I don't want to see them any more, not even that bitch. Raffi... She came to me two days ago and I had a hard-on, like steel I had. And it was good for her, I saw, she wasn't faking it, it was good for her. And then she told me she was getting married. The bitch. But she's right, what does she need me for? What does she need a cripple? I love her, Amnon, I'm going crazy, I love her. What are you babbling about, love her? You don't love anyone, - You don't give a damn about anyone. - Amnon... Come on, Raffi, you kick her, humiliate her, throw her to the dogs and then wonder that she's getting married - to someone else? - Amnon help me. I'm asking of you, talk to her. Go Raffi. You have to do it yourself, no one helped me either. Go to her. Nira. "I Don't Give A Damn" English: Roey Perlstein. Subtitles: Elrom Studios
