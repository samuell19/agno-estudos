E1, E2, E3. E1 also covers the syllabus for 11th and 12th grades. You can only pay 20 percent of the amount via cheque, sir. -The rest has to be paid in cash. Next! -Okay. -Come forward. -Admission for NEET? -Of course. -Give it. Sin square X into plus cos square X. Equal to sin square X into plus cos. Equal to sin square X into plus cos square X. One minus sin square X. If X… If fX is equal to cos square X, then f is equal to how much? This is your homework. Please write it down. Pay the fees on Monday. Is the lecture over? What did he teach? No clue. But he wants us to do homework! -Will it be vacated in two days? -Abhi. -Yes? -Sign this. Who is he, Mom? -Dad is selling grandpa's video store. -Why? What do you mean, why? Have you seen the way you study? The way you score won't even guarantee you a seat. Is there any other option? We have to pay a donation. Go and clean out the shop tomorrow. This was the first video store in the village. It is also the last video store. It won't exist anymore. That's all on me. Don't be sad! It's being sold to fund your education. When was the last time you came here? Back in the tenth grade. Abhi, your grandpa was a man of wild taste! Shut up! -Let me see. -Just kidding! This is a fabulous collection! This will set the internet on fire! -There's more stashed inside. -Yes. Show me that. I think it is an adult video with some local hottie. -Local hottie! -Grandpa has been very benevolent! -Wow! -Hey, bring the TV. Okay. Lower the volume. Lower it. -Who is this guy? -The hero. He seems to be teaching. This is vintage porn. Back then they didn't go to the climax directly. -First, they set the mood, gradually. -Okay. They present the story first. Next comes the screenplay and finally the real deal! Just wait for it! This is boring! Why can't you go past it? Yes. -Hey! Wait. -Yes. Rewind that. Pause there. Isn't this the homework the professor gave us? -Homework? -Homework? -Increase the volume a bit. -If fX is equal to cos square X plus one minus cos square X, the whole square by the sin square X plus cos to the power of 4X. Cos square X plus one plus cos to the power of 4X. Minus 2 cos square X by sin square X plus cos to the power of 4X is equal to one. Understand? Here, you have to use the A minus B whole square formula. He is an awesome teacher! Yes! Who is this guy, bro? A. S. Murthy. 4th May 2000. Siripuram? That's close. -Let's go there. -Just let it go. If he is willing to tutor me, I may actually rank high in EAMCET. I won't even have to pay for the admission. -You are right. -I know, right? Sachin, listen. Where does A. S. Murthy live? -Murthy! They are asking about you. -Me? Hey, kid. He's not the one. The one we are talking about is at least 50 years old. There are many folks called Murthy here. Which one do you want to meet? Ma'am, do you know a professor called Murthy? There is a peon who works in a government college. You can ask him. He's not a lecturer, kiddo. He is a talented student from this college. He comes over sometimes. -Where is he now? -He must be in Kadapa. He is the Collector of that district. The Collector? Would he tutor us? I don't think so but we could try. Excuse me. -Yes, tell me. -We have come from Annakapalli. We want to meet the Collector. This isn't him! -Let's go. -He is the Collector. But he's not the guy in the video! Let's go! -He's looking at us. -Listen! What is it? Who are you guys? Come here. How did you enter my cabin without knocking? Sir, we came from Annakapalli. Yes, so? Actually, sir. While cleaning out his grandpa's video store… Video store? -What's your grandpa's name? -His name was Bhushan, sir. Are you Mr. Bhushan's grandson? Please take a seat. When I was a student I was very close to your grandpa. I visited your house when he passed away. I guess you must have been in the fourth or fifth grade, back then. -Fourth, sir. -So, tell me. Why are you here? When we were cleaning out grandpa's video store, we found these video cassettes. When we played these, a professor was teaching math. That's where we found a card with your name on it. It was in the box. It was lying with these cassettes. That's why we… Who is teaching in this video, sir? He is my guru. Balu sir. In the 1990s, privatization of the economy led to an improvement in the country's economic policy. People's lifestyles were getting better. Education was a crucial requirement. Professional courses like engineering and MBBS were in demand. To take advantage of this demand, some people turned it into a business. Education was now a business. Private junior colleges were set up in every city. EAMCET coaching centers peddled the idea of better education and began to ask for higher school fees. During that time, state governments could not run government junior colleges. The situation was so bad that the government was unable to even pay the lecturers a salary. Private college owners capitalized on that and lured the best professors with good pay and bought them out. Many government colleges closed due to a lack of lecturers. Poor students who could not pay for private education were dealing with a huge problem. That's when their parents resorted to protests and campaigns. The growing business of private colleges was a thorn in the opposition party's side. Down with selling education! -Close down private colleges. -Down with selling education. This proves that our government is good for nothing. For five years, private colleges are doing business under the guise of education. Let me tell you -I became a graduate for 5000 rupees. -Silence. Be quiet! Sriniwas Tripathi. Chairman of the Tripathi Educational Institutes and president of the Private Junior College Association. When the government failed to run its government colleges, it made a plan to create the Fees Regulation Bill. So they would save their image and Tripathi's private colleges could be held in check. Then he created a master plan. A man with a dangerous vision. If he were Dronacharya, he would have asked Eklavya for all the fingers, not just one. Private junior colleges and government junior colleges will work in tandem. Government colleges that were shut down will be absorbed by us and we will run them. We will send over our best lecturers there. We will also pay their salary. How can we do this? It's so strange. -How did he think it would work? -This isn't right. Silence. I am not afraid. What is this, Tripathi? You can't go on TV and say something random! Shut up! I think twice before feeding the poor. Whatever I said has been said with full clarity. Education was a nonprofitable service in this country. But we have found tiny loopholes to turn it into a big business. But a Fees Regulation Bill can finish all of us. Tell me, Mr. Srivastav. Your coaching center takes 45,000 rupees per annum. If the fee comes down to 6,000 rupees, you don't mind, right? What about you, sir? Mr. Ramanuj? Your institute collects 80 percent of fees in cash. It's well known. If there is an IT raid can you survive it? Tripathi, if all the best professors are sent to government colleges, who will study here? Sudhakar, you really have to start thinking! -Who is sending away the best professors? -What? We will only send junior lecturers there. The kind who take attendance while -senior lecturers are out. -Clarify the kids' doubts. They refer to guides -and clarify the students' doubts. -Okay, sir. If boys from the hostel get into trouble, they sort out fights like a watchman would do. There was a bet about a volleyball match for 100 rupees, sir. Now they want 1,000 rupees. Pass it! -Pass it! -Give it here. Yeah! Sir… I'll take care of it. Here, take it. Come on. Let it go, let it go. -Where are you going? -Brother. -Don't lose it. -Hello. -Who are you? -Myself, Balu. Bala Gangadhar Tilak. From Tripathi Institute, I'm a junior lecturer there. I teach math. -These are my students, brother. -So what? They didn't know what they signed up for. Forgive them, please? -Pay up and leave. -One moment, brother. Got any cash in your pockets? Give it to me. -Here you are. -I only have 100 rupees, sir. That will do. I have about 600 rupees as a donation, brother. You can keep this cash. Please let the kids go, brother. -I beg you. -Get going. Thank you, brother. I'll see you. -Take care. -Yes. -The heck with you! -Let's get this started. Are you in school to study or place bets? -Let's go. -We're tired. We will play the rest of the match tomorrow. -Hey! Did you fall while playing? -Let's go party. -Don't overact. -I am not. Sir, they beat me. Heck with you! I will break your limbs if you don't pay. How dare you make bets and not pay up? I beat the crap out of them. Brother? Did you beat up my students? Yes, we did. What can you do? Oh! Hey, Babya, look! Phugu, what happened? Did he hit you? Phugu, talk to me! Talk to me! Tell me what happened. -Sir, what did you do? -Oh! -What did you do, sir? -Take this. -Did he hit you? -Sir, they are -coming this way. -Take good care of this. Damn you! Hey! Hey! Get lost! Darn you. Get going! Hey! Get those kids! That should calm him down. Run! Hey! -Keshav. -Sir. Pen. -Hey! -Sir! That's not me, kiddo. That's the hand of God. Good morning, everyone. There is a specific reason for this meeting. Tripathi educational institution has decided to nurture some state-run colleges. I will send you there as faculty. Send us anywhere you want, just pay better. But your pay scale remains as it used to be. If you perform well you will be rewarded with due consideration. -Sir, but what reward can we expect? -Who asked that? I did. -Sir. My name is… -He is Bala Gangadhar… If you could tell us what we will get we can work sincerely, sir. What do you want? Tell me. Sir, if you like our performance promote us for sure. What? Right? Okay. If every student in the college you are posted to passes in the subject taught by you, then I will make you a senior lecturer. Okay for you? Okay, sir. Super, sir. Thank you, sir. -Sir, was it necessary? -Yes. Last month, my driver refused to drive and wanted a raise. I told him if the car had no scratches for a month I would give him a raise. Till last month the car was pristine. But this month? It's been dented in three places. When I want to evade their demands I put them under excessive pressure. They make mistakes under pressure. -Hey, did you turn on the AC? -Yes, I did. Okay. Since then he hasn't mentioned a raise. In fact, he's glad I didn't fire him. All these guys are in the same boat. -Don't worry too much. -Yes, sir. Okay. When you want to find out the circumference of a circle -first you must… -How much salt should I add, Uncle? Two spoons. Oh! Balu. Where is Balu? He leaves tomorrow. -Brother Ansari asked him over for dinner. -Okay. -Uncle, what is this? -The PF matured the day before yesterday. I bought three acres of land in Ooty. Rich man! After I become a senior lecturer, I will buy property as well. -Balu. -What? -Always remember one thing. -Yes, tell me. Teaching isn't only a profession. It's a duty. Your salary is not as precious as the future of your students. Yes, you've lined your pockets. -Now you're preaching penury. -What? You're in a different league. You're flying solo. You can study kids for free and still buy land in a hill station. It's different for me. I have bills to pay. -Okay. -Yes. -I will transfer the property to you. -Really? Will you teach for free in that case? Transfer it first, then I will think about it. -What? -Uncle! Sir! Balu sir. Oh no! He's at it again. -Dad, what's this? -Meet my son, Balu sir. Balu sir. Sir, please have a seat. Dad, don't you get it? Don't call me "sir". Narayan, the driver. For the past 30 years, I have called a lot of people sir. But today, my son will be called sir by the college. Let me also say it, sir. Balu sir! Dad, your son Balu isn't a big shot. He is an ordinary teacher. Don't be so respectful. Teachers are the living image of God, son. Yes! -Your name please. -Bala Gangadhar. Brother. Shall we go? Hey, buddy, don't stand around. Get the car on the road. -Yes. -I am not the driver. -I am the driver, sir. -Okay! -Your face confused me. -Oh! Bala Gangadhar. Math teacher. Karthik, Chemistry, Royal Junior College. -Yes. -Bluereddy, Physics. -From Pondicherry. -Okay. -Sir. -What? Bro, recently I have undergone a hydrocele operation. I can't lift weights. -If I do, it will hurt. -Oh! -I will do it. Don't worry. -Thank you. Can you smoke after surgery? It was for hydrocele, not TB. The doctor won't tell me not to smoke because of that! You'll die early. What I wish for Is mocked by this land Why are you in a school uniform like a kid? Respect. Even the sea mocks him Eat as much as you eat, pal Life is saying this to you for so long You are wearing the robes, carry your sack You can do your own thing You are a solo traveler You are the path, you are the traveler Renounce the world and walk along, gypsy This is someone's instrument And this string belongs to someone Everyone sings in a different tune -What do we eat then? -It's a hydrocele. We must figure out a way to get the students to pass. So we can make it to senior lecturer grade in no time at all. -Brother! -What? Brother, why are you sleeping? Yes, I'm listening, brother! -No, you were sleeping. -No! -My ears were open. -Just listen to me. Wake him out of his stupor! -Hey, patient! -Hey! The radio is on. Stay awake and enjoy it. Let the burning sun burn your heart out When the tears drop, call them the rain You can get warmth tenderly But first, seek to make friends With the cold You are the path, you are the traveler Renounce the world and walk along, gypsy This is someone's instrument And this string belongs to someone Everyone sings in a different tune Stop here, stop! Sir, are you from the city? Here to teach at the college? I am the peon of the college, Swami. Satti, the guests are here. Why are you sleeping? -Get up! Get out of here. Run away. -Oh! Why are you hitting him? Let him sleep. Sir, this is what he always does. Come this way. Come on in. We have three rooms here, sir. This one has an attached bathroom. The other two rooms have washrooms outside. I'll leave, sir. I will meet you tomorrow at the college. Good day. Brother, since my hydrocele surgery I have to keep going to pee. I will do this for you. I will take the bedroom with the attached bathroom. Okay? See you tomorrow morning. Hey, wait! That hydrocele pops up every single time! -It's not a tumor. It's an ostrich egg. -Chemistry. -Don't fight with Physics. -To heck with this! Smoking will harm his health! I will stuff a whole cigarette pack inside you. -Listen to me. -Hey! I will stay in that room. Hey! Listen! You'll be cursed by the hydrocele patient. You will be roaming around with ostrich eggs in tow as well. Hey! Focus on your eggs, forget about mine, loser. -Hey, mind you! Don't mock my hydrocele! -Stop it, both of you. -Darn it! -I am quiet because of you. -Do you know how much it hurts? -Hey! -You know, right? -You've said enough! Stop it. Why are you fighting like kids? Who are we? -Teachers! We command respect. -Yes. Okay. Fine. -Here's what we can do. -What? Let’s decide this by playing Inky, Pinky, Ponky. I don't mind. -Okay? -Yes, it's okay. -Inky Pinky Ponky, okay? -Yes. -Father had a donkey. -Yes. Okay? Donkey died, father cried. -Inky, Pinky, Ponky. You step out. -What? He died, right? -It's just the two of us. -Yes. -Inky, Pinky, Ponky. -You bet! -Father had a donkey. -Yes, you bet! Donkey died, father cried. Inky, Pinky, Ponky. The room is mine! Yes. God! That was nicely pulled off. You take care of each other. I'm out of here. Inky, Pinky, Ponky? Father had a… Forget it. He is the donkey. The hydrocele hurts more when it's cold. Okay, nice. Wow! -This is nice. -Yes. Sir, the teacher is here. -Okay. Hello. -Come along. -Hello. -Come. Take a photo! -Ready? -Hold that pose. They are welcoming us like wedding guests, right? Shoot the video. Fantastic! Okay! -Do it right. -It's okay! Hello, sir. I am Pathi Paparao, the headman of the village. -I won three years in a row. -Wow! -Yes, thank you! -Congratulations. My brother-in-law mentioned you were coming over. I've been here with my chair since morning waiting for you. Which brother-in-law? -Mr. Tripathi! -Oh! He is a distant relative. But we are really close. This one, no! This one. This one, here. -Greetings. -He is Sudarshan Sharma. -Vice Principal and Hindi lecturer. -Hello. -He is highly intelligent! -Okay. -This is Mr. Dixit. -Yes. He is the principal. -He teaches History and Sanskrit. -Greetings. Oh. This is Mr. Bhushan. -Oh! -He runs a massive video store. He is our videographer and also our photographer. -No sting operations, I hope? -No! Never. He doesn't do that? -Let me explain. -What? There is an old cinema hall outside our village. -Okay. -Every Saturday he screens -romantic English movies there! -Oh! That's how everyone knows him. Hi! -Let's go to the college, sir. -Let's go in. Why is the second-year classroom closed? Nobody comes here. Why? For many years no teacher has been willing to come here. That's why the college was shut down. It has reopened recently. In the first year, there were 27 kids from MPC. -And commerce students? -Not a single one. Which means, the entire year was a holiday, right? No way. The government won't allow us to languish in peace. We are sent to God-forsaken places on election duty. It's a chance to roam for free. What a great perk! My dear. -Good morning, sir. -Ms. Meenakshi. She is a biology lecturer. -I am Karthik, the chemistry teacher. -Hello. I am Bluereddy. -Hydrocele! -What is it? Balu. -I teach mathematics. -Okay. She has been teaching here for four years. She has received pretty good offers from private colleges. But she turned them down outright. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Please sit. -The students seem excited to study. -Yes. My daughter, Mahalakshmi. Study well to become an engineer -and make your dad proud. -Okay, sir. -Okay, I will carry on. Please enjoy. -Yes, sir. -Come this way. -Yes. -Yes, goodbye. -Greetings. Okay, students. It is our first day, today. -Please introduce yourselves. -Okay, sir. What? Meenakshi is mine! -Watch out for your pain. -I saw her first. -She is mine! All mine! -Damn! -She is mine! -What is this? You keep fighting all the time! -Who are we? -Lecturers! -Correct. -Yes. We have some dignity. -It's always the same spiel. -Listen, buddy. -What? -The teacher isn't for you. -What did you say? -Yes! -Karthik? -Yes. -You don't deserve her. -What? Are you going to call dibs on our girl? Wow! That's an amazing idea. Thank you! -What? -Hey, accountant! This is a love triangle. Don't add another dimension to it. -Yes. -Scram while you can. -What are you doing to me? -No! Hey! I will marry Meenakshi ma'am after two years. We will have little kids who will call you uncle. -Uncle? -Bring a Rakhi to my house on Raksha Bandhan. -Shall we try Inky Pinky Ponky? -What? -Yes. -What did you say? -Inky Pinky Ponky? -That's what you want? -Yes. -So, Newton, are you gambling to win Meenakshi ma'am? -No! -You listen to me. I am a great math teacher. I will do the math for ma'am. -Okay, brother? -Okay. All good, chemistry? -Okay. -See you around. Hey! The third man benefits from our fight! -It's a holiday every single day. -Yes. I now get what it means to warm a chair! Brother. You could have tethered the buffalo in here. -What a great idea! -At least it could be a cowshed. We will mint money too! No headaches! But the students came yesterday. That was all a show. All the kids in the village who have passed the tenth grade were called by the president for a photo op. So that people would think highly of him. Here's an example of this. You will get used to this, gradually. Balu sir's dream of being a senior lecturer was falling apart right in front of his eyes. He was falling apart. Silence. -Please play. -Hey! -Do you want to offer me something? -No! Do you know this is… the only government junior college in the whole district? Until two years ago, kids from the nearby villages would come here to study. -Why don't they come anymore? -The college shut down. Those who had money sent their kids to private junior colleges. The poor sent their kids to work. They had no choice. But the college is now open, ma'am. We've been called here to teach, right? What if you abandon them too? What if the college shuts down again? The students showed up yesterday because they were given snacks. When they wanted to study, they had no teachers. You have come here, but the kids are still scared and unable to believe it. Forget about them! I don't believe it either. Why not? I don't know how to say this. Come with me. Where is the notebook? Look at this, sir. My name was being used to play "Flames". They got an "S" at first so they changed the spelling! Meenakshi was changed to "Minakshi". -Should I trust him? -Reddy is different, though. For you. What? You will be in the same boat after a week. Then it is only a month, tops. You'll run away since you won't be able to endure life here. I can guarantee that. No, ma'am. I came here with a goal. I won't run away. No matter what happens. After three days, as in on… Monday. You will find every student from the village present in the college. This is my challenge to you, ma'am. Okay, ma'am? I'll leave now. Take care of yourself. -Yes. -Sir! Yes, tell me. -Where's Gopika, a student of the college? -Vegetables for sale! Snacks for sale, popadums for sale! Here. We are poor, sir. We have to run the house as well. We can either study or eat. The president called them for a day. I can't send them every single day. If she learns to stitch, she can earn for the house. What is the point of studying? Where is Gopal, the first-year student? I don't want to teach him. He doesn't need a degree to run a cowshed. Shyamala runs an idli shop, sir. -He doesn't listen to me. -Shiva owns a grocery store. The kids gamble since they have cash in hand. He's grown up now. He will mend his ways after marriage. Dad took the entire year's salary in advance, sir. The master won't allow me to leave now. Wash the utensils! Who are you speaking to? Dad, I also want to go to college. She completed the tenth grade. That's enough. We live outside the village, sir. We earn daily wages. If she goes to college who will do the household chores? She has been hired as a maid. She earns 2,000 rupees a month. -Priest-- -I can't send him. Forgive me. Math teacher, I just wanted my girl to read and write. Her mother is teaching her to cook and do the other chores. We will get her married soon. -It's normal with every family. -Sir. Can you help me with something? What are you saying, sir? You are my brother-in-law's man! Just say the word! I would like you to call for a village meeting and have the students attend it with their parents. We will do that. -Hey. -Yes, master. -Get to work. -Yes. People will come when I call. They can't stay away. -Yes. -The village is here. What's going on? -Yes. -Let's go to the back. -Why were you called? -Let's see. He's the teacher who came to our house. The village has turned up for your council meeting. But no one comes for my lectures to the college, sir. Many kids are working at jobs and doing hard labor. When we spoke to their parents about this they said, "We have to eat." Don't get judgmental! Education is also for making money. What is wrong with that? My wife, my kids, and I go to work daily so we can eat. That's when we get two square meals. If we send our daughter to college the three of us will starve to death. Well said, Bhole. Math teacher. Have you met our inspector Mr. Suresh? He gets 4,000 rupees after deductions every month. -That's right. -That's Somu. Ask him. He is uneducated. He is illiterate. He never closes his shop until he makes 5,000 rupees. -He earns more than a graduate. -Exactly! What did your education give you? Zilch. Fans! Okay. Let me tell you a story. Here it goes. A fisherman and his family lived in Rameshwaram. The wife looked after the house. They had five kids. The family was really poor. Despite that, they sent the kids to school to study. The wife often went to sleep without eating. So her kids could eat well. I don't know what miracle the mother's sacrifices wrought that her youngest son turned out to be an ace student. Yes. He was good at every subject. He graduated as an engineer from the Madras Institute of Technology. He went on to become a scientist at ISRO. Missile man! That's the name he is known by. Some years ago, he also tested a nuclear bomb in Pokhran. Can you tell me, who was that great man? A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. If his father had thought back then that his son should go fish with him so that he can catch more fish. Then I can sell them in the market and make twice the money. If that had happened, our country would have lost a great scientist. Some time ago, you called the inspector, Mr. Suresh. But you addressed Brother Somu who sells liquor, informally. Paparao. What? Mr. Paparao… there are many ways of making money. But if you wish to earn respect then you must study and learn. No. Now I have fans. I am with all of you. I will always be with you. Your futures are my responsibility. Let's meet at the college. -You're going to college tomorrow onwards. -I'll go to the college tomorrow onwards. Go and study well. I want to study at this college as well. I want to be like A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. -Don't do anything wrong. -Why not do it already? Balu sir. Balu sir. Ma'am! Get all the classrooms cleaned nicely. -The kids will come tomorrow. -Yes. You've won my trust and the children's faith. Welcome to the college. -Oh! -Oh no! No point waiting for them. Nobody will come. -Mr. Sudarshan. -Yes. Your speech didn't affect them at all. Nobody will come. What is this? -Dad asked me to return the money. -Why? I am going to college. Bye! If you don't study well, I'll break your limbs! She won't go! Read the story of this directionless dream Don't stop, no matter what Don't cower when you know what you want Choose the moments and create your life Live as you want The lamps of hope are lit Drive away the despair How much will you win? Listen, be brave, love yourself Forget the jackals, find the way And find the ploy No matter if you are alone Don't lose your resolve Go on and study! Go, Murthy! Do something Listen to me You have one life Live life -Fight your fear -Murthy, don't be scared. -Touch the sky -Come along. You have one life When encouragement will ally With dedication Hopes will arise in the eyes The walls of difference will break down Joy and happiness will abound Study and learn, do something Listen, you have one life Live life and drink every moment Touch the sky, you have one life Everyone has done a fine job with the homework. Superb! Thank you, sir. But your handwriting is a perfect match with each other. Why? Who did the homework for you? Tell me. If you don't have the answer, no class today. Forgive us, sir. None of us wrote it. -Who wrote it? -Satti wrote it for all of us. Who is he? He used to study at our college. A week before the EAMCET exams his parents consumed poison and killed themselves. The incident pushed him away from his studies. He gradually got addicted to substance abuse. -Take this. -He would do anything for some money. He went from being an orphan to being destitute. Will you work for me? I'll pay you 30 rupees daily. Just do as I say. Come along. Mother! Forget the ploys of the world Forget about money Join hands with each other You have one life Dreams are multicolored The lamps of dreams are lit Educate yourself You have one life, bro Your mother's flowing sweat Is your line of fate This is what you need to learn You have one life Wherever you go in the world, Think of the father Add to his pride You have one life Didn't you go to play cards? Dad, I've given up playing cards from today. What did you say? This dance is one life This song is one life It's all one life Read and write Do something Listen, you have one life Live life, drink the juice Touch the sky You have one life Hurry up. Give the money at once. -Someone may come here. -Why sell state-level books? -Forgive us, sir. Don't tell anyone. -Forgive us, sir. Get up. Rude! Bumpkin! Are you out of your mind? If you do this again -I will tell the principal. -No, madam! What is it, madam? Teach your worthless friend how to treat women. What did you do, bro? He misbehaved with my daughter. Oh my God! -I was just trying to woo her. -Yuck! Woo me, my foot! Listen. -Are you drunk? -This isn't a mark caused by drinking. Madam's slipper left that imprint. -What did you say? Sick! -Darn you! -Useless loser! -Do you see that? Two lovers -Life is a hot mess. -Close to each other's heart You are the only one You'll roll over if you drink so much. The mosquitoes will also bite you. Come on in. My body has been beaten by madam. I don't fear mosquitoes now. Go in, and bring some mosquito repellent. Malaria. Take care of my Meenakshi. -Goodbye! -Sleep in a mosquito net. Okay! Where are you going? I don't want to die. Wait, please. Don't fear malaria. Nothing will happen to you. My grandpa, my grandma, and my uncle died of mosquito bites. -I don't want to die. -But… -You are thick-skinned. -I know, but it's not armor. Don't underestimate the mosquitoes here. They are worse than Dracula when it comes to sucking blood! -You can stay if you want. -Good morning, Sir. -Hey, why aren't you in school? -Good morning. -Did you complete the homework I gave you? -Hey! Physics! You saw that, right? They said good morning to you and didn't even acknowledge me! I don't want to stay here. Listen to me. Wait! Bye, sister. What rotten luck! What should we do now, sir? From now on, I will teach -Physics and Chemistry. -You will? -Yes. -Are you qualified to teach both? Madam! You are underestimating me. I scored full marks in inter. I didn't do so well in English. Otherwise, I would have scored 1,000 out of 1,000, quite easily. Reddy sir and Karthik sir have gone home. I guess they have some problem at home. That's why I will be teaching you Physics and Chemistry from today. -Yay! -May we come in, sir? -Come on in. -This will be fun. I will take combined classes for first-year students. Please adjust a bit. Get up, you. -Give me a place to sit. -Move aside. Our topic for today is… -Hey, get up! -Why should I? -Speed. -Move and sit down. -Hey! Watch yourself, okay? -Hey! -Hey! -Hey. -Hey! -What are you doing? -I won't spare you! -Get lost! -Get lost! -Let's go. What's going on, anyway? What is it? Sit, please. Sir. -They can't sit with us, sir. -Yes. Why? Because they are… -They are what? -These people are different, sir. -Different as in? -As in lower caste. We can stand and study, sir. -Yes, sir. -Yes. Go out, all of you. But what have we done, sir? Get out. Come on, make notes. Speed. -It means the rate of movement. -Why are you standing outside? Sir told us to go out. But why? -Balu sir. -X by… Ma'am, five minutes. Please, ma'am. Thank you. When an object travels from one place to another during a certain interval of time then it is called time rate. -Did you all get it? -Yes, sir. Do you understand it well? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Very good. Get out. Yes, go on! Now you guys come on in. Velocity, which means the direction of the speed. Because we will bring direction into this equation as well. The units will be meter per second. -Does everyone get it? -Yes, sir. Okay, you guys can come in now. Come on. Everybody stand up. Come on, quickly. Get up. Today, I've explained two topics to you. The first is speed. The other is velocity. I will test you on both topics. All of you must come prepared. -What? -But sir… You only taught us about speed. But sir, you only taught us about velocity. Today, I've taught you both topics. The first is speed. The other is velocity. I will test you on both topics. Be prepared. Sir, this is wrong. -Why is it wrong? -Yes, sir. How can we give the test without being taught? You are bothered by the fact that I divided up one topic between two groups. But for umpteen years now you have been dividing up humanity on the basis of caste. Doesn't that bother you? They won't even sit with us, sir. Yes. This is a village, so it's acceptable here. Maybe, in the future, you will go to some city for graduation. Will you discriminate even there? If you study well you can get a good job. Perhaps, your boss may be from a lower caste. Will you turn down the job by saying that you won't work there? I have been teaching you for so long now. Do you know what my caste is? You didn't need to know, right? That's because I am your teacher. So, you didn't think it was important. When you got Sattu to do your homework, you never considered his caste. Why? Because needs don't consider caste and creed. When the Almighty hasn't discriminated while creating us then we have no right to discriminate either. Forgive us, sir. Teach us all together. No. Today, I've taught both of you two topics. -I won't teach you again. -But we did nothing wrong. Veera, you've understood what sir taught you, right? -Yes, I get it. -Okay, I will teach you about speed. You can teach me about velocity. -Okay. -Okay? -Come along. -Padmavati! Come. -Come. -It's easy. Let me teach you velocity. A square is equal to AB square. Wait a moment. Look at this. I said you can't enter the class. I can't say no if you come into my heart. My heart wants a place in your heart I will stay with you I won't go anywhere else You heard me say it Now you can say it too I will walk with you with my eyes closed I will give up on the books And study about you Teacher, don't say no, tell me What is the language of love? Please explain it to me Teacher, don't say no, tell me What is the language of love? Please explain it to me -Go away! -No! No, Sir. Come on. Come on! Without seeing you… I am going home for a few days. This number… It's from an STD booth near my house. If you need anything, please call me. You may not be around me Even then I will give you full marks Like the surrounding scent of the flowers I will always stay close to you like that Your name will follow mine Written by the ink of my kohl This is my birth chart. Ask your mother if everything is in order. Yes. Okay, sir. Teacher, what is love? Tell me Ready? Smile! Hey! The results are out! Let's check it out. -Hey. Where is mine? -I passed! -75 percent! -I passed! -Me too! -This is it. Balu sir passed his first exam. All the students got first class. The entire college was celebrating. It looks so lovely. -Hi! -Hi! All this has happened because of my encouragement. -Yes. Math teacher, you hit the mark! -Hello. Sir. Meenakshi madam is missing. -Balu sir! -Madam! Sir! One moment, sir. Oh wow! -Brother-in-law! -Please, come. Hello, sir. How are you, sir? How are you, brother-in-law? Sir. -Bala Gangadhar. -Sir, that's me. -You know what, brother-in-law? -Bala Gangadhar. Ever since I found out he is your guy I have been looking after him. Sir, do you recognize me? I asked you a question at the meeting the other day. -That was you! -Yes, that was me. -Okay. -Brother-in-law. Come on in. -Let's cut the cake. -Come, please. Come this way, please. Mahalakshmi, come. -Right here. -Brother-in-law. -Brother-in-law. -So, you… -Brother-in-law, -Sir… feed me. -Sir, feed me, as well. -Yes. Sir, I completed the challenge you gave me. In fact, I did it even better than your request. All the students passed with flying colors. It's not just maths, I taught them Physics and Chemistry, too. And Meenakshi ma'am taught them Biology. She is a very good teacher, sir. -Good. -Sir, keep on encouraging us like this. Next year, all my students will top, sir! Hey! These bottom feeders have managed to pass by mistake. Don't walk around thinking you're the real deal! Distinction, my foot! Sir, what have I done? You are going to destroy me. My college's passing rate is 75 percent. And this government college has a passing rate of 100 percent. "Now we will study in state-run colleges.", is what middle-class customers from the town branch are saying. Not customers, sir. They are students. They are customers! Bloody customers! This is a business. Every large business has middle-class customers. Listen! It took me years to brainwash them. And you are changing everything! What did I change? A good education costs more. Do you know what the Tripathi logo implies? Making the biggest bucks! Zero fees, zero education. More fees, more education. That's how it goes, at present. Inter plus EAMCET, 25,000 rupees. Inter plus IT, 45,000 rupees. That's the business. The one who has money will pay from his pocket. The one who has less will take a loan and pay for it. What if they don't have money? Then they can come to these state-run colleges. Listen, they have very low expectations from life. The inter-final exam is a big deal for them. When they pass, they cut cakes and celebrate. But what happens at the end of it all? They will either do farming or scoop filth. Or they come to the city to become drivers or clean people's dirty dishes. Bloody lower middle-class! My dad is also a driver, sir. My family belongs to the lower middle-class category, as well. Hey! No! I didn't mean… I wasn't talking about you. You didn't take over these colleges to make them better. You did it to add to the business. You've misconstrued what I said. I didn't mean that. You didn't send me here because you trust me. You thought I would fail. Hey, Balu! I spoke in anger. Don't mind. Forget all about it. You are really talented. I've seen that. This isn't the place for you. Come with me. I will make you a senior lecturer in my college. Forget 50,000, I will pay you one lakh. I will give you a house, I will give you a car. Come with me. Let's go. Sir, the food is served. Okay, let's go and eat. This way. Eat well, sir. Excuse me, go and sit there. -Don't mind, please. -Okay, sir. -Take more, if you want. -Yes. Eat well. Lower middle-class, sir! They lack common sense. Please eat well. You know what, sir? The parents of the lower middle-class sacrifice all they have for their kids' future. They starve but they won't let their kids starve. They will buy new clothes for their kids, while they mend their torn ones. Even if these lower middle-class parents wanted to send their kids to private colleges they would have to auction their blood each month. How long will you suck on their blood, sir? Upon due consideration, I have made my decision. Their future matters to me more than your offer, sir. Their lives mean more to me than my salary. What can you do? You may get them to pass the next year too. Will that change their lives? They will pass, and they will top the grade, sir. -How? -Here we have 27 MPC students and 18 BiPC students. Every student will score the EAMCET rank, sir. I won't let that happen. Knowledge and wisdom are like offerings made at a temple, sir. You have to share it. Don't sell it like a dish at a five-star hotel. Mr. Tripathi! Stay calm. Your BP will stay in check. Bye, sir. Brother-in-law! Please wait. Give me that. -Okay, take a photo. -Yes, one moment, sir. Fool! Another photo, sir. Brother-in-law! Tripathi, you told me that you would send some loser to the government college. But because of you, we are going to lose everything! -He is alone. -What if he doesn't give up? What if other professors join him? His article on the tenth page will appear on the first page in the future. What if his photo appears instead of yours? Hey! I set up my empire by bringing together unemployed teachers. I will not sit on my hands if someone tries to destroy it. -He's a junior lecturer. Just fire him. -No. I have signed a contract with him. I'll have to give him a notice six months in advance. And I don't want to do that. Does that mean the government will pay the penalty for you? The opposition will thrash us! The CM won't agree. No way. Hey, Tripathi! Did you buy another luxury car? -It's not mine. -What? -What do you mean? -It's yours. I don't mind. But the CM won't go for it. Hey, why is this snake here? The CM won't listen to you. But he will have to listen if the opposition leader says it. -Tripathi, can you do me a favor? -What? Don't ever get into politics. I certainly won't. Education pays better than politics. Our country is facing a growing unemployment problem, every day. The real reason is privatization, Mr. Speaker! Fulfill our demands! Fulfill our demands. -End it! -Come… -What are you doing? -Come on. This is unjust! I will file a case against you. The president has said that I must not give you milk. If you want milk, buy it elsewhere. I can't help you, sir. My unemployed friends, who had approached the employment exchange for jobs, tell me, does the government have any answer for you? Do they have jobs for you? No, they don't! We have only one demand! That they should pass the bill of taking government education out of the private sector at the earliest. -Hit him! -Hit him! He's getting hit with shoes. Look at him. This is so sad! Give the car keys inside. Don't come to work from tomorrow. What happened, sir? Go and ask your son. Sir! Last year, officers' negligence led to no induction of lecturers in government colleges. That's when private colleges made up for the slack and a new era began. But now the situation has changed. Five hundred lecturers have been selected through recently conducted interviews. So far, their posting lists aren't ready. The reason is that all the government colleges are now under private colleges. Although this decision was taken in the public interest, it has led to an increase in unemployment. That's why the MOUs signed with private colleges back then will be canceled with immediate effect. That's why private lecturers posted in government colleges are being recalled by order. Don't worry, son. Everything will be okay. Every year, I go to Kashi for Meenakshi's' father's death anniversary. -Meenakshi will come with me this year. -Yes. Bye. -Take care. -Bye. Sattu! Sattu! -Sir. -Yes? -Have you seen Sattu? -He's drinking at the bar. Wipe your face. You have to give the second-year supplementary exam. Do you remember the condition? You must do as I say. My parents passed away. Now you're leaving, as well. Who do I give this exam for? This is meaningless now. You wanted to become an engineer. But I didn't have money to pay for it. -Forgive me, son. -What are you saying, dad? If a single student becomes an engineer because of you then I would be pleased. When their parents will be elated because of my son I will feel so proud! What is it, dad? Why are you mulling over the past? If kids' wishes are not fulfilled, they cry for a few days and then they forget about it. But until the kids get what they want the father cries every single day. You won't understand my sorrow right now. They thought they won. But the real battle had just begun. How will the kids learn -without a teacher? -That's right. Give me your book while leaving. -Where are they going with bags? -Veera. Where are they off to in the morning? -To attend the lecture. -What? Lecture? The professors will come after a month. What lecture is he talking about? -Yes. -What's this mess now? Let's go and see. Come on. Oh my God! -Hello. -Brother-in-law. That maths teacher is still here. He has put up a hut on the farm and is teaching there. -Sir. -Get out. -Tell me, what to do, brother-in-law? -What, man! You fool! He set up a hut on the farm, and you're asking me what to do? Aren't you the headman? Listen, find out whose farm it is. What's happening, teacher? -Get out! -Hey, brother! No! No. Hey. Get up! Hey! Hey! -Let's go! -Hey! Wait! Stop. Let's go to the police station. -Let's go! -Sir! These goons came and demolished the place where the kids used to study. I know what happened! Come with me. -Let me go! -Hey! I get it. All of you are in cahoots. Each one of you. What is this nonsense? -How much did you sell out for? -What did you say? What is the price of this uniform? Are you accusing a cop? Give me that baton. The government didn't give you a uniform so you can sell out. You are calling a cop a grafter? -Stop it! -What is this? What are you doing? Back off! You attacked a cop! I will straighten you out. Let's go. Take him away. Let's go. Start the car. -Sir! -They're taking sir away. -They are taking sir away! -Sir! -Sir! -Where are they taking sir? -Sir! -Balu sir! -No! Sir! -Stop the car! -Sir! -Sir! -Sir! -Sir! Sir! Sir, it's a sin to beat up a teacher. Is it a good deed to hit a cop then? Hey, teach him a lesson! -Sir! -Sir! -Sir! -Sir! -Stop them! -Let sir go! Let our sir go! -Sir! -Sir! -Sir! Let him go! -Let our sir go! Let our sir go! Headman! The cops have arrested our Balu sir. -Come soon. -Our Balu sir? Amazing! You've become great friends in four days! Are the cops crazy to arrest him? He usurped Subba's farm. He complained and hence the cops arrested him. That's impossible. This is a lie. Subba allowed the classroom to be set up. -Tell him! -Speak up! -There's a call for you. -Who is it? It's the SI. -Hello. -Sir. The students have lost control. They are creating a ruckus here. Arrange for a lathi charge. They will all run away. Your daughter is one of them, sir. What did you say? -Leave! -Wait! Everyone, calm down! Get out of the way. Quick, let's go home, son. -Come on. -Quietly go home with your parents. Listen to me. Let's go, home. -Sir! -Leave me! Come on! -We will die, but we won't leave sir. -Go away. Hey, isn't that your daughter? -Take her, go. -Let's go! Let's go! No! I don't want to go! -Sir! -Hey, run. -Let's take them away. -Release sir! Hey. Don't increase his popularity by keeping him in jail for so long. Just drive him out of the village. -Okay. -Not with respect. Humiliate him. Okay. Bala has scammed us by selling kids' books for junior college. There's more. He colluded with the members of the village council to get control of Subbaiah's fields. He misbehaved with the cops. Moreover, he provoked the kids to riot. That's why sir has decided that Master Bala will be driven out of the village. Sir, you called me? My slipper is torn. Stitch it at once. What is this? Are you teaching your daughter to vandalize? She threw rocks at a cop. -No, master, our sir… -Shut up, or I will silence you forever. Why are you looking there? What are you looking at? What now? It seems like the cops brought the teacher here. -Get rid of this one. -Sure. Sir. No, sir. This is sir's order. Why are you here? Hey, stop! Stop right there. -I said, stop! -Hey! -Stop! -Sachin, no! Wait. Stop! This is sir's order. -Sachin, stop it, son. -Hey! -Listen to us! -Get away from here. Go on. Get lost! Hey! -Back off! -Get out of here. -Let's go. Come on. -Hey! -Let's go! -Let me go! Hey! Hey! He is the teacher who taught you, right? Hey! What he did was for you, right? Today his feet are burning up! But you are sitting at home in peace. If you go there I will break your limbs. Is this a village or a grave? -Hey! Let me go. -Hey. What is it? Hey! Mahalakshmi! Mahalakshmi! Wait! -Manju! -My dear! -Sir! -Hey! What are you doing? -Hey, Ranga! -Hey, old man! Stop your son. Hey, Veera! What are you doing? Sir will toss us out of the village. No! We live outside the village anyway! He can't throw us out! I am not scared of him, father. You never showed me, God, in the temple. I saw him at school. He is my God. This was the grief The good will be treated badly Keep walking like this That's what the way says We are the dust in your path Apply it to your forehead Even the teacher's path Is filled with thorns Why must God distribute sorrows like this? You are the one Who governs our life, sustainer All those who are defeated By fate are allied to you The aggrieved sun has begun To fade out of sight Darkness has begun To cast its gloom again Without you, nothing will be as it used to How will we last a single moment… Take sir to his house. Our breath is stifled as we think of you I wonder where it will take… What is it? Can't start your scooter? Yes, I have some work. Hurry up, Sharda. Is that Balu? My son! Balu! -Hello. -Hello, Balu sir. -Are you okay? -Madam. I was about to call you. -Are you okay? -Sir, I will come there. I am not happy here. No, madam. Don't come here. The kids need you. Anyway, -everything is over. -Why do you say that? Have you thought about our relationship? I told you, it's all over. Hello! Hello! Hello! What is it? Did the call get disconnected? They will teach you from now on. Ms. Lakshmi and Ramesh Babu. Every hope is dying out The flame is dimmed Like a fog which is mixed with hope This is the brightness of your light So what if you are away from us? We smile because of you You are our identity Without you, we don't exist You are our integrity You are that person Who has divine qualities You are the one who governs Life and death, sustainer Everyone who is defeated By fate is linked to you Where is the aggrieved sun going? Where is the darkness casting its gloom? My son! -Are we there, yet? -We're still far away. -Son. -I am tired. Are you teaching at home? What can I do, uncle? I have to do something, right? -Note this down. -Okay, sir. X to the power of Y. Shivani, are you late for class again? Madam? Who is she? How are you, madam? Let me take this… How is your mother, madam? I told you I want to come to you. You hung up without listening to me! It was my fault. Never trust boys. Still, I trusted you. I was bound to get punished. Madam, stop talking. What will the kids think? -Who is it, son? -Madam, please. Is she selling soap? These folks will never allow us -to be in peace. -Mother. Majority of the time's it's either soap or washing powder. Listen, dear. You can cry all you want. -I don't want to buy any powder from you. -Mother! He promised to marry me and dumped me. Darn! She's lying, mom! Oh no! -What is she saying? -Mother, calm down. My dear. Let me see your face. She is my twin. -How can you say no to such a pretty girl? -Mom! Listen, Balu! To make a girl cry is a very… It's a bad omen, you fool! Hey, class is over. Leave. No, sir. We want to stay. What a pain! -Sister-in-law? -Yes? -What is this? -Your student promised to marry this girl. And that is not all. He even got her pregnant. Pregnant?! Mom, that's not true! -What? -No! -He didn't get you pregnant? -No, aunt. Oh, then it's okay. Listen, useless boy! If you don't marry her… -then I will consume poison. -Mom, stop being crazy. At least think before you speak. How can I take care of her? We don’t have a big enough house anyway. From what I earn, I can barely pay for myself. In that case, I will also work, sir. And If needed… I can take tuition as well. Nobody needs tuition for biology. Kids study that on their own, madam. Don't underestimate me or my subject! Sharda, serve me too. What's going on? Your face is glowing. Hey! What is the matter with him? -He suddenly left. -He must be shy. Oh, he is shy? Hey, who are you? Sharda! Sharda! Shar… -She is our future daughter-in-law. -Daughter-in-law?! She is a lecturer in biology at Siripuram College. Oh! -They are in love. -Really? Sir! Very good. Full marks! I miss the students a lot. Are the new teachers teaching them well? Thank you. No, sir. The college is empty. They could not find a decent lecturer after you left. They take days off and go to teach in private colleges. You must do something, sir. -Uncle, give me five rupees. -I don't want -to discuss this topic. -I've to buy a textbook. -Please, uncle. -Let it go. -I want to study, uncle. -Get going. -I need the money to buy a book. -I can try all I want… Just five rupees, uncle. -I won't get hired as a teacher. -I really want to study, uncle. Uncle, please. -Just give me five rupees. -That's why… -Here. -Thank you, uncle. It is useless, madam. -Anyway, I am looking for another job. -Uncle? Give me five rupees to buy a book. -I will quit taking tuition too. -Give me five rupees. Is this a new style of begging? I am not begging. I want money to buy a book. Get lost! Are you okay? -Sir? -Yes? Can you give me five rupees? Sir, I only need five rupees. My father stopped me from going to school and asked me to work in a hotel. -I get paid 20 rupees a day. -Then why were you begging? I earn 30 to 40 rupees per day by begging, sir. I give 20 to my father and keep the rest for my studies. Okay, now listen to me. I will give you 20 rupees every day. You can give it to your dad. But you must come here to study every day. The student takes after the teacher. What are you saying, sir? Are you joking? I am being honest. -Promise me. You'll study, right? -Sir, I will study. I will certainly come. I will go home and tell my mother about this. Thank you, brother. This is what I like about you, sir. You want all the kids to get an education. But our students… Will you abandon them? -Sir. -Forgive me, madam. I have given up. Sir, if you give up so soon, then those 45 kids who look up to you will give up as well. I would like the kids to succeed as well. And touch the sky. But I am helpless. I want to teach them. But… I can't even set foot in that village. You filled an empty college with students, sir. Where there is a will, there is a way. I understand what you are saying. It's not important for me to stay in that village. The education of those kids is important. I will teach them. -Balu sir! What brings you here? -Hello! You should have told me. I would have come over. Sir, you've been treated badly. -I am very sorry to hear that. -Forget it, sir. -I need your help. -Just say the word! Please do come to watch your favorite superstar Rajinikanth's film, Arunachalam. I'm not making enough money from these sleazy movies, sir. Action movies make more money than family movies. The evening show at six is free for students in the 12th grade. Don't forget! The evening show at six is free for inter-second-year students. Please do come! Watch superstar Rajinikanth's action film… So, now you're trying to woo youngsters as well? -Gopika? -Yes, madam? Come to the theater at six sharp. -Bring your friends too, okay? -Yes. It would be nice if you come. Is this technically possible? We have ordered a new projector from Singapore. We can connect it to the VCR. -Go on, hurry up. -Hey, wait! This show isn't for you guys! -Go home. -Let's go. -Come in the morning. -It's just for the kids. But we want to watch it. Okay. Hey, why are you here? It's okay. Let him go. -It has started! -Yes, it has started! It has started. -What are they showing? -It doesn't look like a film. -It's not a film. -What is this? They said it would be a film. What is this? Hey! -Hello, kids. How are you? -Wait, sir. Hey! This is our Balu sir! Right? -What happened? -Yes, it's Balu sir! -Sir! -Balu sir! Sir! -Should I start? -Yes, sir. Okay. Hello, kids. How are you? We are fine, sir. Do you miss me? Yes, we do, sir. I miss all of you every moment, kids. Forgive me. I wasn’t there when you needed me. But it will never happen again. I promise. You have exams in a month, right? No problem. From today onwards… from six to nine in the evening, your classes will be conducted here. I will teach you math, physics, and chemistry. Biology and the other subjects will be taught by Meenakshi madam and Dixit sir in college. Like the first year, 70 to 80 percent won't do. This time, you must not aim for less than 90 percent. -Do you get it? -Ninety percent? What? Ninety percent?! You can do it! I know that. But our goal isn't just scoring well for the inter exams. -EAMCET? -EAMCET? What is it, Murthy? Are you scared? Yes. Since childhood, you have been living in fear. Let's scare your fear away. You must study. Only then the world will give in to you. All those people who stopped you from studying… All those who took advantage of your situation… And all those who think that girls are born only to cook food. We need to give a befitting reply to each one of them! We will dwarf their trivial mindset… with your worth. You must work hard to get to the destination. And we will do it. Those who are with me on this mission, raise your hands. I am with you, sir! I am with you, sir! I am with you! -I am with you, sir! -I am with you! -We are with you, sir! -We are with you! -We are with you, sir! -We are with you! I am with you, sir! -We are with you, sir! -We are with you! Let the dark disappear You be the light You are the weapon And this is your war So what if you are not with us? So what if there is nothing? You are the rising sun And you can watch the circle of fate We have no tickets! Get out of here. Let it happen The students need to clear some doubts. I will do something. Sir, we are performing the play, Bhukailas today. -Please come. It's an amazing show. -Wow! The play was terrific. And Ravan stole the show! I will come every Sunday. And I will clear all your doubts. -Listen, keep this money. -No, sir. I have been playing sleazy movies all my life. Today, because of you, I'm doing something good. -This is enough, sir. -Knowledge is the only way across. What? Hail, Narsimha Swamy! Who is that man running in disguise? Follow him. Sir, why are you here? Why didn't you call me? -I would have come to you. Sir, listen… -What? Shut up! -Sir. -Since when has this been going on? Don't tell anyone, sir. -Answer me! -Sir. -Sir. The kids will have a future. -Hey! -Sir, I beg you! -Get lost! Sir… -Mr. Suresh. -Sir? What are you doing here? All good? Yes, I came here to see a movie. I see. I am going to the city. I'll be back by morning. -Okay, sir. -Let's go. What was this, sir? I have made a lot of mistakes in my life. Countless mistakes. But now it's time for me to make amends… by choosing to overlook this. It really went well. What brings you here, sir? You are the Chief supervisor of this center. Right? Yes, sir. My students are giving exams here. -Okay. -Give them what they need. -Understood? -Don't worry, sir. -Hey, Tripathi sir! -Can I leave? I will take care of everything. Good morning, sir. -Who are you? -I am Paparao's daughter. Papa… Sir, she's the daughter of the head of Siripuram. -Why are you guys here? -This is our exam center. Today was our last exam. -We did well, sir. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -See you, sir. -Bye, sir. -Bye, sir. Bye. Sir, did you call me? His name is Bala Gangadhar Tilak. -Find out where he is. -Okay, sir. What is the matter with her? She's studying late into the night. -Your daughter wants to be an engineer. -Why? She has to marry and go to the US anyway. I don't need to get married for that. Once I complete my education, I can go to the US on my own. You must never back down… What are you doing? Press my feet. -I was studying. -Keep walking ahead -And attain freedom from your shackles -You can go. Let this world fill with The waves mind the watch These are the best students of our branch, sir. Top-ranked prospects. Just carry on -Play this cassette in the theater. -Yes. -Take care. Okay? -Yes. You must never back down This is your battle You are the fighter Be victorious in this war Defeat every enemy Balu isn't here, sir. But he records his lectures on cassettes and teaches the kids. He records them? Yes, sir. -Hello? -Yes. He is taking video classes in a theater in your village. While you are watching TV at home. No, brother-in-law. It was just… -What is a video class, brother-in-law? -Listen to me. Tomorrow is the EAMCET exam. Make sure no one from your village attends it. Get it? Brother-in-law? There is a limit to being vile. If I cross it, I won't be able to look at myself in the mirror. I thought, in the future… you would be of some use to me. But now, I realize you made me commit so many mistakes. Just saying. Where were you all this while? -Do you know what's the time? -Mom, that… Listen. Don't scold her. Why not? If she comes home late at night. Then, why shouldn't I? You go in. How are your studies going, dear? -It's going well, Dad. -Okay. Now go to bed, dear. -All the best for the exam tomorrow. -Okay, Dad. -You've gone through this chapter, right? -Look at this… Hey, who are you? Why did you stop the bus? Don't behave like goons. -Hey! -Hey! Sit down quietly. Don't act too smart. I am hijacking this bus for three hours. -Don't move a muscle. -That's not possible. -We have an exam. -Damn you! Sit down quietly. -Why are you hitting me? Bloody… -Hey! Gopal, sit quietly. All of you sit and study. Mahalakshmi, open your book. Doesn't it bother you that the villain is in front of you?

It stopped! No. Run! -Let's go! -Hurry. -Let's go! Hurry. -Let's go! Sir. Sir… Brother. Brother… the kids need to go to the city for an exam. I would really appreciate it if you could drop them off. The carts are loaded with grain, boss. There's not enough room. -It can't be done. -Brother, they really need to give this exam. Their future is at stake. But this grain… Ramaiyya, why are you throwing away the grain? Are you insane? Put it back. Hey, I am not insane. I have thought about it. It is possible to sell the grain tomorrow as well. But the kids won't have a future tomorrow. Don't waste any time. Take the kids away. You can keep the grain down now. Hurry. Unload them! Untie the ropes. Let it all down. Hey! Hurry up! Let's go. Brother, thank you very much. -He's here! -He's here. He's here. Let's go. It has all our seat numbers. Check and tell us. How much did we score? All of them made it to the merit list, sir? What was your rank? Murali Krishna, 41. Medical. Suresh, 59. Medical. Bhargavi, nine. Medical. Kusuma, 55. Engineering. Congratulations. Ananta Lakshmi, 43. Medical. N. Rambabu, 29. Engineering. M. Venkatlakshmi, 30. P. Mahalakshmi, 15. C. Padhmawathi, eight. G Pramila, 33. B Veeranna, nine. -Congratulations! -Congratulations. -G. Mahesh, 17. -I told you we would do it. Yes! So all 45 were top-rankers? -All 46 of us. -How come, sir? There were only 45 students, right? There is another hall ticket. A. S. Murthy. A. S. Murthy, first rank! Who is this? -Who is this A. S. Murthy? -Who is he? I don't know him. Was he in our batch? Including me… there were 46. He's our Sattu! Sir told me to give these to you. Sattu, what is your full name? Anupam Satyanarayan Murthy. It's too long. We won. Balu sir, you did it! Balu sir, you won! My son made the impossible happen! Ninth rank, right? Even then you will have to pay 3,000 to 4,000 every month for the course. But your income is only 900 rupees, right? -Yes, sir. -That's okay. You don't need to take a loan. I will pay for your son's education going forward. I will send him abroad for his higher studies. I will get him the post of sub-inspector in Amalapuram. I will get a hotel built for your mother in the city. In return, I want one thing. You just have to say this. You got the rank after studying at Tripathi Institute. You did a six-month course at my college. That's what it says. Sign it. The farm that was mortgaged… belongs to you now. The ZPTC Chairman post is now yours. Sir, I brought Balu. All your students have signed my agreement. Even in their sleep, they will say that my college got them the ranks. If they ever mention your name in public. Then I will destroy their future. Do you understand? That day… during the assembly… I could not see you properly since you were standing far away. You're as small as a mouse. But you tried to challenge a lion? Tripathi sir… You said something to me back then. "Zero fees, zero education. More fees, more education." All the students up on that board have not paid even a single rupee as fees. In fact, you gave them lakhs of rupees and bought their ranks. You enhanced their worth! Do you call this your victory? No, sir. You're living in an illusion. I'll take your leave. The man who didn't trust you… is standing at your door today. He is asking you to be the brand ambassador for his institute. In the same way, every brand has a celebrity. This is the respect I wanted you to get. That's what happened. Superb. This is a big deal. What is he saying? Sign the contract papers. How can he say that? -I won't sign it. -I won't. Sadly, education has turned into a business in our country. In the future, it will grow even bigger. Soon there will be a time when the fees for kindergarten schools will be higher than the current engineering fees. A father will have to mortgage himself to educate his child. For now, Tripathi is one of those robbers. But there are many such traders of education in this country. Your educational needs should be paid for by people like him. His greed is your victory. If he sends you for higher education, then go! Use his ego to climb up the ladder of success. Reach a good place. Make progress in life. And then… help those who don't have money to study. Make them all successful like you. It appears there are 46 of you. But if you decide… you can change the entire education system. Take the first step and sign the contract. I can never forget my first day at Tripathi Educational Institute. All the lecturers were helpful and encouraging from day one. Come. Go and sit. -Go on. -Whenever I lost my way, they guided me on the right path. They are responsible for where I am today. They set a goal for me. And helped me achieve it. I… I have no parents. Tripathi Educational Institution, that's my family. Everyone goes there with their parents. I don't have parents. Can you ask him if he can accompany me? He left. Gone, like a messenger after granting a boon. After that day, we never met Balu sir. Maybe he felt Tripathi would harass us because of him. That's why he went away. The broken theater, where Balu sir taught us, is now a coaching center. All 46 of us take turns throughout the year and take classes for underprivileged kids. -That's your grandpa! -Your grandpa's photo! Because this ocean of knowledge is for everyone to swim in. This was our fee… to our Balu sir. Where does Balu sir teach now? I don't know. Uncle, give me some bread. Take this, child. Thanks. Do you want to study? Of course, sir. Come with me. But no matter where he is… knowledge will never be sold there. It will be distributed. Just like offerings made to God. Thanks! SALUTATIONS TO THE TEACHER
