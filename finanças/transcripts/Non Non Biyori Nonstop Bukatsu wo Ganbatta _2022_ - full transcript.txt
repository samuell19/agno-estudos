Renge! Are you done cleaning over there? - Yes! - Yes! Done cleaning the corridor. Everyone, before you go home, I'll hand out your homework for the day. I thought you'd forget. Sorry about that. Shiori-chan, here's your homework. H-Homework! Is this the first time you get homework, Shiori-chan? So this is... the thing I've heard so much about. Let's all do it together! Okay! Everyone's okay with this, right? Yes. How about we do it at my house? Yay!

Please come in. I'm thirsty. - Me, too. - Homework! - Homework! - There's barley tea in the fridge, right? I'll help you! Thanks! (1-Digit Addition) Can I start? Let's do it together. How about we race to see who can finish first? Okay! I'm done! I'm also done. So fast! The homework was fun! Nattsun, you look like a mop cloth that's been squeezed out. A mop cloth! Why would you compare me to that? Why do you look like that? I just don't wanna do my homework. Huh?! Even though it's really fun?! Nattsun dislikes studying. She's a weird one! I-Is that so? If you don't find it fun, if you can't like it, then you should study in a way that'd make it fun for you. That's a great idea. Do something fun! M-Me?! DNA. Keep your arms like that, hold a pencil, and start doing your homework. The weird way you hold your pencil looks fun! It's not fun at all for me! There's no point if I don't find it fun! And it's super hard to use the pencil like this! Please do something that makes me think, "This is fun!" They're so noisy. Umm, let's focus on our own homework. This is what I think. Rather than doing something that you think will make studying fun, it's better to study something that you think is fun! T-That's a sound argument! Shiori-chan, you said something really good. Nattsun, what's one thing you think is fun? Like... ball games? Then, make use of arithmetic to create a miracle ball! I'm sure that it would make studying fun! I-I see! Alright! Let's do the formula in the backside of the paper! First, the approach run speed just when you're about to throw a ball! My approach run speed is... I wonder what my speed is? Mach! Okay, the speed is mach! Now, the power I put when I throw a ball! Umm... The power I use when I throw... The power of five cats! That's too weak! Make it into horsepower! Five cat horsepower! And now, add 45 degrees of the wrist snapping! Once you arrange them all...! (5 cats, 45 degrees, mach) ((mach x 5 cat horsepower/45 degrees x Ï€/4) x 0 + willpower) It's done! This is the equation for a miracle ball! Wow! That's amazing! Nattsun, you did it! While you all did something weird like that, I've finished my homework. I've also finished mine. Then, let's all play something! (Homework: Finished) Homa-chan, Hotaru, you want to play with us? (Homework: Finished) Sure! (Homework: Finished) What are we going to play? (Homework: Finished) Of course we gotta play dodgeball! Let's go outside! (Homework: Not Finished) Non Non Biyori Sis Kazu is here. What's up? I... want to be a captain! And I want to become a company president and laze around all day. I want to laze! It's not that! I want to become a club captain! I want to make a new club in this school! What club are you planning to make? A badminton club! Let's aim for the Inter-High! Inter-High! Inter-High...! Isn't Inter-High a high school competition? Let's see... Even if you say that, we don't have the equipment, and there's no one to teach you. I have my own equipment! I'd like to ask the school to take care of the rest! Now that I think of it I think Kaede once got really into badminton and have a set. Maybe you can ask her. I will! (Closed) - Why do I have to do something like that on my day off? - (Closed) Go home. We're aiming for Inter-High, so please lend us your strength, Coach! - Coach! - Coach! Hey. I don't have that much free time to entertain Natsumi's pretend captain play. This is not a pretend play! Vice Captain, please say something! This is a real pretend play! It's "club activities", Vice Captain! Vice Captain...? I'm the vice captain. And Shiori-chan is the secretary. I will write alphabet letters! No, you got to do badminton there. We need a coach's strength to go to the Inter-High. So please help us, Candy Store. You won't do it? Well... So this is as far as I can go. I couldn't even do one miracle ball. How... How was that? I feel like something like this has happened before... You're right. I'll serve, Hotaru. Sorry! Sure. Candy Store, what were you looking at? We'll go again! I know already! Darn it. I don't exercise, so I can't really move my body now... Coach! Please teach me too! Hey, that's danger- Candy Store, are you okay? I really... am bad with kids. (Please be quiet in the corridor.) My name is Kaede Kagayama. Middle school, third year. I... Alright! It's time for recess! I forgot to bring Shokichi! Take this, Candy Store! Natsumi punch! I... hate kids. School's over. I'm so tired. I'm gonna go home and have some snacks! Hikage, can I go to your house today? I'm planning to go to Natsumi's house once I drop off my backpack. Well, then that's the more reason... Your parents are working in the field, right? I mean, taking care of, you know... Are you talking about Renge? I'll ask the neighbors to look after her, so it's fine. I see. But, you know, if you keep asking your neighbors, it's like... you know? Alright, Renge. Come here! Alright! That's amazing! You've gotten used to walking, huh! Good job, Renge. Alright! As a reward, I brought something good for you today. Ta-dah! Crayons! Look, there's a lot of different colors. Pretty, right? Wait, Renge! That's not food! Did she mistake it for a candy because I always give her some? You use it like this, on a sketchbook or something. Look. You put the colors on it like this. It seems that you're interested in it. Just watch. I'm drawing your face now. Well, I don't really have an aptitude for drawing. Doing this... What are you doing, Renge?! Don't draw on the wall! I have to apologize to Auntie later. Can this be cleaned with a mop cloth? You can't draw on clothes, either! Draw on that sketchbook over there! I drew on it earlier, didn't I?! Here! I'll clean up the wall, so draw on that sketchbook and be a good kid! Mop cloth, mop cloth... I have to wash my clothes when I get home, too. Did I at least get it less visible? And here I came bringing crayons out of my good will. She didn't even understand what they're for. I guess I really am bad with kids. Renge! Did you draw something? Is this... a person? "Candy..." Could it be... Is that me? My name isn't Candy Store, but Kaede... No, that doesn't matter. Did you just draw me and call my name, Renge? I'm home. Candy Store! How's Renge? Any problems? Candy Store! Why are you crying? I'm not crying! - But your eyes- - I said I'm not crying! Candy Store? Candy Store! Candy Store! My name isn't Candy Store, but Kaede. Alright! We'll do a special training for smash! You two, stand over there! - Ooh, smash! - Smash, smash! Yeah. That's right, I played badminton with everyone. That's right. And Candy Store is pretty strong. Yeah, the blond one from that time. That's right! But with the miracle ball equation that I did... Miracle ball? Yeah. Renge-chan is amazing! Yeah. Yeah! I see! I wonder if everyone's skills improved? I'm also doing my best practicing. I want to play badminton with you again. Let's have another match! I won't lose next time! I'm looking forward to it! That's right. Yeah. So, that's why... Ah, the rainy season just started here. It's so hot every day. It really is summer! I see. It's already summer over there, huh? Yeah. Before we know it, it's been a year. Yeah. I wanna go to Okinawa again. You should definitely drop by! I also want to see where you live, Natsumi! Come on over! I'll be waiting! Let's meet again. Yeah. It would be great if we can meet again.
