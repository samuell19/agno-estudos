'..the status of Special Economic zone.' 'Every time, Debraj Rai comes down to the streets.' 'Debnagar's ordinary citizens are used by him..' '..to make a committee to protest against the division of land.' We will give blood and life. But Debnagar's land will not be.. 'State government's wrath is felt by the normal citizens.' Debnagar's development.. 'On one side, there is protest and rebellion.' Listen to me carefully. 'And on the other side, the power show of the government. 'Because of the rebellion that caused death of so many people..' '..Debraj Rai sat for food strike till death.' 'The government bowed down to the demands of Debraj Rai.' 'The government is compelled to give in.' 'The decision to divide the land is taken back.' Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail, hail. - Hail. 'And ever since that day..' '..Debraj Rai became God for the people of Debnagar. 'Their dear Debda.' 'The destroyer of all the evil forces.' 'In order to develop the state of the people of Debnagar..' '..Debraj Rai stood for the election independently.' 'And won without any contest.' - Debraj Rai. - Hail. 'After becoming the leader..' '.. Debraj's focus and knowledge becomes focused on Debnagar.'

Hail Debraj. - Hail. Hail Debraj. - Hail. What is he doing here again? Hey! Go and throw him out. Hey.. - Hey! Stop. No one will do anything. Let him come here. Happy birthday! God of Debnagar. Thank you. There has been change in the state. And hence, I have changed my path as well. I have locked up all the illegal business that I had. Good to hear that, Apurbo. Although you are late it is enough that you have understood. One can achieve a lot more by loving people.. ..than by ruining them. Come on. Have some sweets. You are asking me to have sweets? And your boys want to tear me off.. ..and hence giving off fake smiles. I will come some other time and have food to my heart's content. Have fun! Don't trust this man, Debda. He is like a snake. Keshto. Father used to say that a guest is like God. If the guest is an enemy.. ..respect him if he comes home. Do you know what my father used to say? He said that I have evil in my eyes. Whichever place I go to.. ..turns into a graveyard. And the ones I lay my eyes on.. ..becomes a dead body. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." Come on, fast, fast. Here you are. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to brother." What is all this that you have started? Abhi wanted to do something special for your birthday, Debda. Yes, brother. Abhi wanted to present his mother to you.. ..on this happy day. And hence, take a look, brother. Although it is a picture.. ..he has got his mother as a present for you. Uncle, will you play badminton? Why? Don't you have school today? - Yes. Where is your school bag? I have given it to Sidhu? - Meaning? He didn't have books to study. That is why I gave my books to him. - I see. No. I don't think what I thought would happen. I don't think there is a slightest possibility.. ..of your son becoming a doctor or an engineer. I don't have any interest in knowing.. ..whether he is a doctor or engineer. He should just help people. People should love him. Father. Sidhu doesn't have books. He hasn't been able to pay the school fees too. That is why Bablu was making fun of him. I felt very angry and I slapped Bablu. Sir scolded me and said that I don't care about anything. Tell me, father. What is the meaning of not caring about anything? Is it good or bad? Not caring about anything would mean.. ..one who doesn't care about anyone. He does what feels is right. He holds truth close to him. And keeps injustice under his feet. Don't let this quality in you die away. This is your challenge. This is your character. Come on, Anshu, we have to go out. Come on. Bye, father. - Goddess, hail. - Bye. Brother. - Yes? Are you sending Abhi to the hostel? Let me see. But I don't think he will be able to without us. He will do something in two days and come back. 'Mumbai's dangerous don.' 'Underworld king, Gurunayak Singh.' 'The cops are under pressure to arrest him.' 'Arms, drugs, contract killings..' '..extortions. All of these are his forte.' 'Gurunayak and his brother are spreading terror..' '..in India and South East Asia's four countries regularly.' Sir, you had made a special task force to arrest Guru Nayak. What happened to it? It has been a year. We are on the job. This case will be solved very soon. Look. They are showing your father. Sir, you have been saying the same thing for a year. So what do you want to hear? Want to hear something new? Yes. - Yes. So write down. Police department inefficient. Happy? This is our police department. MB news. Father, look, they are speaking rubbish about you on T.V. Don't you feel bad at all? It is true that we haven't been much useful as of now. Father. Wouldn't you be able to arrest that mean man ever? We will definitely be able to arrest him. Till date, there has been no criminal.. ..who has been allowed to go scot free after committing a crime. In order to finish a criminal.. ..we need a man who doesn't have a care in the world. He should have an attack like a cheetah and a lion on the enemy. It is not his mission to finish criminals. It is his passion. He is a force in himself. "What is up? What say?" "What is up? What say?" "Challenge." "Challenge." "He has got the challenge, guys." "He is going to rock you." "He is going to move you." "He is going to rock you." "Yes." Hey, you! Why are you looking that side? Look here. Absolutely fresh. Hey! Hey, fool, I will set the question paper. And all of you will give the answers. Brother, he seems like a cop. Oh no, I think this fool was born.. ..within half a kilometer from the police station. On just getting one slap.. ..he understood who I am. Yes. Police. This is a market, sir. Everything is sold here. Even the police. The one who gets sold gets a promotion. And one who doesn't get sold is dead. Hey! All the things that you have sold and bought till date are merely.. ..some useless vegetables in the garden of the cops. I am of a different kind. High breed. Do you know people of my department call me? Tiger! Royal Bengal Tiger. When people hear that I have come down to the streets.. ..in the hospitals, morgues and graveyards.. There is a house full board hung everywhere. Hey, listen! - Yes? How was the dialogue? The public will be very impressed, brother. - Really? Another wicket down. What do you want? - The train is on the line now. Guru Talwar. Tell me, where is he? Whenever Guru comes to Mumbai.. ..he stays with Sunny Supari. Birju. Ever since your birth.. ..your father never ever trusted you. How can I trust you? I am telling the truth. I swear. Leave me. Okay, fine, we will meet again. Hey! - Birju. Do you think my father used to say? He said that we can know the way if we have the eyes. And if we have brains.. ..we can know how many potholes are there on this path. Hey! Challenge. Sir, without counting the doors and windows.. ..inside the house while standing here.. ..we should attack. Do I need to learn from you about what is right and what is wrong? And who told you that I am counting the doors and windows inside? I am confirming whether Guru Talwar is inside or not. Sir, I have confirmed news. He is inside. Whatever you hear is not information. What you see with your eyes is the confirmation. So what if my father named me as Madhusudan Bakshi? I am Byomkesh Bakshi(detective) in my heart. Sir, you are messing up the matter without a reason. It will be a risk later if we don't attack right away. Idiot. -Yes. Do you know the risk I have taken in life to come here? Just wait for my signal. What kind of a signal, sir? I will call out like a bird. What if I cannot hear you? I will call out aloud. Sir, I think braying like a donkey would be better. That is your status. - Sir. Fool! Come on. Look, Sunny. Explain it to Afzal. How can business run like this? Guru is getting angry. Okay, brother. I will take care of that fool. Shinde. - Yes, brother. None of the illegal properties should have Guru's name on it. Got it? Today, we must not let Talwar get out of our hands today in any way. Okay? There. - Okay. Joydeep. Follow me. Sir asked us to wait for the signal. If we wait for any longer.. ..we would have to wait for sir all our lives. What is this? This is not a bird but Tarzan calling out. Whatever I thought has happened! Crap! Hey, fool, who are you? Why have you come here? Hey, why are you hitting me without a reason? At least listen to me. Tell me, fool. - Sir, I am a real estate agent. The party called me to see a house. And I came here by mistake. Hey, don't hit me, sir. I have a wife and kids at home. The story is good but I don't believe it. Hey, hey, are you a fool or an idiot? Don't you have any brains? Oh no! I was waiting for you in the next house for one hour. And you are sitting here and having fun? Hey! Who are you? - Agent. He has been trying to convince me about a property for one month. We were supposed to make it final today. He is not doing it and has gone down on his knees and acting here? Fake man. He is fake.. Teach him a good lesson. Abhi. You cannot talk to me like this. What do you think of yourself? Does one talk to a senior officer like this? You are going beyond your limit. I will complain to the commissioner about you. Hey fool. - Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.. - Hey, let us go. Well done, Abhi. Thank you. The gang member of Guru Nayak whom you have arrested.. ..is very useful. Through him, we will be able to know.. ..a lot about Guru Nayak's activity. Well done. - Thank you, sir. Good morning, sir. - Come on.. Good morning. Wait, sir. Please, sir. Please let go of me. What happened to you now, Mr. Bakshi? Bullet on, sir. Didn't they get any other spot? Not them, sir. Even if they are the members of the mafia.. ..they have a sense of location. They are not nonsensical like our department. If I would have shot without avoiding it.. ..they would have killed you. Hey, don't talk nonsense. Before they started shooting.. ..the things that you told me.. ..were more dangerous wounds for me. I didn't have any better option to save you. Wow.. - Here he is. He is my son-in-law.. - Hey, listen. He feels so much for me.. - Hey, police Gupta. I will come again. I wouldn't spare you. Did you see that, sir? Did you see how he shot that man like a dog? Not like a dog. I shot a dog. There is no control on him. If you don't change your behavior.. ..you wouldn't be able to stick around in the police department. If the police doesn't stop bothering.. ..there wouldn't be any difference between a cop and a shopkeeper. Crime is a spin for me. And criminal is web for me. And to clean this system is my challenge.

"Don't take it, fool." "Hey, don't give it, fool." Challenge! "Don't take it, fool." Hi, brother. - Hi, Pat. Hello, who is it? Nayak. Guru Nayak. I killed him because he committed a mistake once. He was my old aide. He was very dear to me. Wash your hands properly after veneration. If you touch something else.. ..the place will remain the same. The corpse will change. No, sir, he didn't die. He was killed. If Guru Talwar was killed in the police lock up.. ..it is proved that our department has their men. But they were a little late in killing Guru Talwar. Meaning? What do you want to say? Hey Pawar, what will happen if we give it on 180 degrees? Sir, in that case, he will die. What is the point of keeping him alive? In any case, he has decided he wouldn't say anything. Sir has to be bathed and then fed. Then he has to be taken to the court. The petrol will be burnt uselessly and time will be wasted. It would be better if we killed him here. I will tell you. I will tell you. Speak. No one knows about the address of Guru Bhai. His younger brother.. His younger brother, Bunty, maintains contact with everyone. Where can we find that fool? I don't know. I don't know. But he.. He goes to Malaysia to meet his girlfriend at times. We cannot disclose this news in front of the media. And yet we have to tell them something so that they can make news. Suspend. You have to suspend us, sir. - What? Yes, sir. At that time, we will look for Bunty, Guru Nayak's brother. Before that, we have to feed the news of our.. ..suspension to the media. Everyone must know that we are inefficient. The police officers in charge of this case have been suspended. We are carrying on the investigation with a special officer. If these officers are found to be ineffective.. ..then we will take steps to punish them. Yes. - This is great. This is great. - Superb! This is great.. - Yes, it is fun. Party. This is fun. - So much of fun! Hey, brother. Brother. Let us enjoy. Let us have champagne. Oh no. I am bored of winning. Unless I get an attack from the opposite direction.. ..heart, lungs, kidney.. ..don't seem to exist anymore. Isn't there a single person in the whole of police department.. ..who can challenge Guru Nayak? Heads. - Yes. Get ready, guys. With our lives at risk.. ..we have done a lot for this country. Every time, we have been successful. But this time, the mission is a little different. But we have gone on a serious mission like this many times, Abhi. What is the difference? This time, the criminal is the teacher of all criminals. Guru Nayak. Where is he? I think he is in some warehouse somewhere around. I have news that Guru Nayak's brother.. ..Bunty is in Malaysia at the moment. So operation Malaysia. Raj. What is this? What is happening? A single.. Not a single piece of information is right. All the information is wrong. Abhi! We have got it. - What? The girl stays in Cool stone. What? Imphat Latulima. What do you mean? 4 or 5.. Amzad Bhai. Thank you, Amzad Bhai. - Thank you. Thank you. - Bye. Come on. - Come on. What next? We have keep a watch on the egg. Till the egg doesn't burst and the girl doesn't come out. How would we know which girl is the one among so many of them? She is not amongst all of these. How did you understand? The girl is Bunty's girlfriend. A booked girl never gives a flying kiss to someone else. But yes, the girl will come. She will come after two days. As soon as the planets are in favor.. ..she will come. Do something. - What? Leave the job of a cop.. ..and join a T.V channel as an astrologer. Yes, priest Joydeb Shastri. At the moment, tell me, what is there in me destiny? Will I find the girl or not? You will find her. But some other girl. Not hate story. Love story. She will come in front of you.. ..and she will stay as your housewife. Can you speak less rubbish? Focus on the job at hand. Excuse me, are you looking for someone? Yes. - He is the only one. Stupid. Hey, stupid.. - Hey! Your calculations were wrong. Hey, what rubbish are you talking? Everything that I am saying cannot happen just now. The prediction will be done at the beginning. And then, confirmation. And then, conclusion. Yes, Amzad Bhai. Yes, yes. May Lord be with you. I will reach. Sure. Listen. Amzad Bhai has called me. He wants to share some information. Okay? Shall we come with you? No, no, there is no need for you to go. You can do something. Yes. Go to the terrace and keep an eye on your surroundings. Okay? We will meet again. Keep an eye. Excuse me, sir. - Yes? May I help you? Pack this one for me. - This? Hey! No, no, human beings can make mistakes. But planets can never make a mistake. Hey, I made calculations last night again. If the Jupiter comes into your life once.. ..the girl will be fixed in your life forever. Abhi. The girl. Why is she here? - For Bunty. Hey! This is a mess. Actually these are about planets. They keep on moving all the time. And hence anything might happen anytime. Bunty and his girlfriend will be finished by me in a single bullet. Have you seen how much shopping she has done? Everything has been earned by cheating the public. The husband is killing and his wife is spending. Keep silent. I think she is coming this side. What is your problem? Me? Yes, you. Why are you guys following me? Now we.. - I think this girl doesn't understand Bengali, okay? Take this girl into a loop in Bengali. Now.. - Excuse me. I know all the letters of Bengali. - What? So what if you know? Yes? We are not following you at all. We have come to have coke. - Yes. Don't try to hide your face with coke. And boys like you can be judged only by one look. And boys are of two types. Type One. They keep on following girls if they see a pretty one. If she gets impressed, it is fine. Or else, they will start following a girl again. Type two. If a boy likes a girl.. ..he will go and tell her directly. I respect boys like that. Not fools like you. Hey! What do you think of yourself? A high rise building? And I am slum dwelling? Have you seen me from top to bottom? Do I seem like a fool to you? Now you explained us a lot about Type One and Type Two. You don't have a type at all. Just shut up, okay? You shut up. Okay? Hey.. - I will box your nose. Hey! - How dare.. Now staying in a seven star hotel and all this shopping.. - Hey.. All this make up and all. - Hey.. Where do you get all this money from? Yes? That is none of your business.. - Now, listen.. Hey, I know about your business very well. Now listen.. - And who is behind this business? And who is behind him? I know everything. Look.. - I will uproot your entire family. Get lost. - You get lost. Hey! - Hey, hey, sit down. Fool! If I could box her nose once.. ..she would have been dead right away. Hey, listen. I don't care if we lose Bunty. But I am not letting go of this girl. You are taking this matter personally. Hey, forget it. Personally indeed. Okay. Understand what I am saying.. - Your bill, sir. How much? - This is strange. Impha Tulima. - What? Hey, same. The room number of the girl. 405. - I see. No, it is 505. - Thanks. 505? What? - That means that the girl is not Bunty's girlfriend? Bunty's girlfriend stays in 505. That is what calculation says. Hey, do something. Go to the hotel and keep an eye on the girl. In the meanwhile, I will go and meet Amzad Bhai. Come on, bye, we will meet. What? Where did the girl go? Strange! - Mother. Hey, here you are. Where were you all this while? Oh no. I was thinking of getting on to the boat since such a long time. Mom! Not boat. Ferry. Hey, dear, okay, okay. It is English after all. So what if I am late? Come on, we will go now. Yes, let us go. - Come on. Yes, come on. - Come on. Oh no. Ferry. Ferry. Very bad. There is not a single boat here. Mother, it is all because of sister. She missed it. Hi, ma'am. Abhiraj Rai. My name. - I see. You are Bengali? Yes. I am Joyita. I am of the same caste. What a beautiful name you have. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. My younger daughter. Srija. - Hi. Hi. My elder daughter. Puja.. - No, no, no, let it be. Puja.. - Quiet. She is clicking pictures, right? Let her. There is no point in disturbing her. By the way, your name is very nice. If you shorten it a bit, it will be Joey. Do you know something? Even her father used to shorten it and call me like that earlier. He used to say that Joey is very sweet. Really? Anyway, are you here for holidays? No, no, no, no. Fashion show. My elder daughter Puja.. - Yes, yes. She is a fashion designer. I see. Really? - Yes. In that Cranton hotel, she has designed the clothes for everyone. Her clothes have been.. - What are you doing here? Puja.. - Puja? He.. - Mother, you have told him my name? No, no, not just the name. She has told me a lot of other things too. Anyway, just forget whatever happened between us. What happened? - He.. Misunderstanding. Try to understand a bit. Hey, even I am.. Type Two. Hey, you are fraud? Mother.. - Even your daughter is like that. Mom.. - Mom, I think they know each other. Yes? - Such a small girl has such a sharp brain. Yes, she is my daughter.. - So what if she is of the same blood group? I have to agree, boss. - Yes. Mother, please let us go from here. Hey.. - Hey, aunt. Aunt! Just let him say what he came to say. - Hey! The girl has gone away. When you lose your chance once.. ..you don't get it back. Yes. Now suffer the consequences. Hey, you. Everything has happened because of you. - What? You understand local language, right? - Yes. You said 405 instead of 505.. ..and got me into a mess. - Hey! I.. - Because of this, I lost Puja too. How did you know that the girl's name is Puja? Your father told me. Abhi. Bunty's girlfriend. Have a look. You have seen the target. Now your focus should be on her. Yes, I am reaching over there. Yes, of course. Hey, leave me. - No, no, not that. Leave me. The girl is going. Leave me.. - Anyway, I will be there. You are here? As soon as you didn't get me.. ..you started running after other girls? Hey.. You and she are completely different. Character is different and the story is different. But for me, your character and story have become clear. Come on. Why is the wheel moving in the wrong direction? Tell me. How can the wheel be wrong if the radial has a problem? Tell her the truth. Will she believe me? If I tell her, she will think I am telling her another lie. Take a chance once. The planets are in transit. Got it? If it has to happen, it might happen. Yes. - Really? Puja. Hi. You are still following me? - I.. How dare you? I will call the police.. Low. Keep your volume low. Don't shout, please. I am an officer of the crime branch of Mumbai police. I have come here to look for a criminal. The girl I was following a while back.. ..is his girlfriend. In fact, I made a mistake and thought of you as his girlfriend. That is why I shouted at you. Sorry. And from the time I have come to know the truth.. ..I have fallen all the more for you. For as many times I wanted to explain it to you.. ..there has been some or the problem. This is my last chance. I have told you everything. I am sure you have understood. Now you can do whatever you feel is right. "With one kiss." "You gave me an electric shock." "With two kisses." "You increased the voltage." "Give me three kisses." "The temperature has gone high." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "With one kiss." "You gave me an electric shock." "With two kisses." "You increased the voltage." "Give me three kisses." "The temperature has gone high." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "You gave me the fever without a reason." "What is the solution now?" "Without the wet cloth on my forehead.." "..my heart is burning." "You gave me the fever without a reason." "What is the solution now?" "Without the wet cloth on my forehead.." "..my heart is burning." "There is a problem." "My heart is dancing." "I will sing a duet with you. I will not stay alone." "My heart is unwell." "Get the thermometer." "I have." "I have." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "Please don't play with my heart anymore." "Come and give me a tonic and make me free from this fever." "You gave three kisses for free. Give me one more." "In this mess of love, I am rendered useless." "Don't try to play hard to get." "Take care of my heart." "I have." "I have." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." "I have got the fever of love." Crap! Sister, why are you so tensed? It is the presentation of such a big fashion designer. I hope everything happens on time. Sister, you are wrong. - Oh no, my bag? Where is my bag? Oh crap! I left it back at the station. Oh my God. Crap. The bag was here, right? Yes, it was. Crap. All my hard work has gone to waste. Sister, come.. - I had lied to father, right? That is why I have been punished. Are you here to have fun? I have come to give your smile back. Do you know what people say about me in the department? If I give something to someone.. ..that particular thing becomes lucky for them. I am giving your bag to you. You will see that all your dreams will come true. Okay? All the best. Hi, come up. Hi, baby. Abhi. - Tell me. Bunty! Hey baby. - Hey baby! Love you, baby. - I love you too. What is it? Do you take so long to come? Do you know how long I have been waiting for you? Hey! Who the hell are you? Hey! What do you think? Marriage registrar? I am sitting here to get you married, Bunty? Police! Let go. Let go of me. Let go. Take the call. Take the call. Yes, yes, yes. Oh no. What is it? Is your weekend over? Hey you. Before the weekend started.. ..your brother has reached his life's end. Hey, hey, who is this? - Police. You have invited trouble by killing Guru Talwar in police custody. I have come to see the size of that trouble. The whole department of police cannot touch me. Hey! So food, how can you touch me? Yes? Hey fool! Inviting each person is like calling trouble for your own self. And I am like a whole bunch of troubles. Hey, hey! Hey, where is Bunty? Where is Bunty? At my gunpoint. Come on, recite some religious paragraphs for him. Brother, save me. He will kill me. Brother, save me. Hey, Bunty brother. Nothing will happen to you. Don't worry at all. He is just trying to scare you. That fool cannot do anything. Now let him pray and die. Here you are. Hey, don't kill him. Don't kill him. If I fix a target once.. ..he doesn't go home. They reach the God of death's abode. You don't know me at all. Fool! I will finish you. Hey fool! My blood group is a little different. If someone threatens me.. ..the blood goes up to my head in a rapid force. If you kill my brother.. ..I will kill you along with your family. Say that again. All the people that you have at every place will be killed by me. Speak it louder. Speak it louder. I will bury you in the ground, you swine! Best of luck. Bunty. Pack up. Bunty. The planets are moving. Got it? Sister. Abhi. While moving.. Come on. - I.. Hey, you know? Your hands are really lucky. My fashion show was a grand success. Do you know how much of applause I got? And Srija was clapping for a long time. For her and for you. Delete me from your heart. We won't meet anymore. Boys are of two types. Type one. They see someone. They loved and they said it. Type two. They saw someone and fell in love. But it took half of their life.. ..to confess about it. I am type one. - Actually.. No.. We are not made for each other. I have deleted you from my heart. Now you must delete me too. Bye. Now.. Because of your words, everything has ended. Nothing has ended. - What? I have just started everything. When I was walking on the right path.. ..I was facing obstacles. Now let me walk on the reverse path. You will see that your planets will talk in my favor. Now let us go. "Hail Lord." "He is the most merciful." "Others' sadness.." I have never seen him as my brother. I have thought of him as my son. How does the one who killed my brother look? He is absolutely rough and tough. He does action like a action hero. As soon as he came, he started thrashing everyone. He looks like a Hollywood hero. Oh no. Fool! Hollywood hero can go to hell. Find out the weak point of that officer. It has been twelve years since Debda has left us. But he is present. Here in my heart. In the middle of my heart. With his blessings, I have become the minister. My life and my ministerial status.. ..have been devoted to this great man. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Doctor! Abhi. - Father. After twelve years, your father has come out of the coma. This is a miracle for us. But let us warn you in one matter. The more happiness you give to such patients.. ..the faster they recover. If for some reason, there is a pressure on their brain.. ..or if they are hurt.. ..he can slip into coma again. And that can be a risk on his life. Abhi, you had faith that your father will recover one day. That is why you insisted on keeping him in the hospital. God has given in to your persistence. But I am scared of something else. Debda loved ordinary people. That is why he wanted you to become and MLA.. ..and be with the common man. You will stand by them in their problems. That hasn't happened. 'I don't have any interest in knowing.. ..whether he is a doctor or engineer.' 'He should help people.' 'People should love him with all their heart.' And apart from that, even your uncle passed away in that incident. Will he be able to tolerate so many truths? Father's return is the biggest truth for me, uncle. And it is a challenge for me to make this truth remain alive. I will go to Debnagar. Yes, it was me. I killed the owner of this house.. ..and took over the control of this house. Yes. Crime and ice-cream are the same for me. Ice-creams still have their sticks behind. But I don't keep any proof of the crimes that I commit. And hence, police couldn't tear off anything that I had till date. Hey, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. Hey, what will they tear? What will they tear? Do you have rubbish in your head? You don't understand anything. It is not tearing off. Not tearing off. It is about doing. How many times should I tell you? Okay, fine, fine. The lip is right, isn't it? I will match it in the dubbing. Hey, learn technology. Hey, you are teaching me technology? So you are here to teach me? You are here to act when you don't even have it to become a watchman? Get out. Get out of here.. - Hey! Whom are you asking to get out? Whom are you asking to get out? You are shooting in my house and asking me to get out? Hey, pack up. - Hey! Fool! Do you know I the director? And yet pack up. I am the owner of this house. Hey.. - Hey! Hey.. - Hey! Hey, call the producer. Hey, call the producer! Can the producer do anything to me? He is Kamal Ghosh. He is the gold coin of film world. Your uncle sold this house to his father-in-law. Kamal convinced his daughter and is now staying in a rented house. But he gives the house on rent. On one condition. He has to be given a role in the film. Although he is useless in films.. ..this gold coin is extremely useful for me. I have worked in 57 movies and out of that.. ..50 have me in guest appearance. Who has come to do me a favor now? He is here to act smart? What is it, Gopal? Hey, pack up! I see. Babla! What is the matter? Instead of supplying junior artist.. ..you are all set to launch a new hero? What? - Is it? No, no, he wants to shoot at your place. - I see. That is why I have got him here to talk to you. - Greetings. I see. So are heroes looking out for locations these days? He guessed it right. - What? He is the hero indeed. - Okay. He is the producer. - Okay. And he is the director as well. Oh God, you have taken up so many.. ..responsibilities at such a young age, brother. You will get spondilytis. Let all that be. Let him talk about the work here. So you have to tell me about the case. Hey, tell him. Yes. - Do you know ex-MLA Debraj Rai? Yes, I know him very well. This house belonged to him at one point of time. Actually my shooting is about his life history. I see. Don't you need to talk about the budget? Don't take any pressure. I have come here empty handed. I will take the money according to the situation. Yes. - Oh God. Hey! What happened? - He did it. What an amazing dialogue, sir. I have come empty handed.. - Yes. I will take the money according to the situation. Hey Babal. - Yes? He is a born artist. - Didn't I tell you so? He will be very useful for us, right? Wait and watch how I put you to work now. It wouldn't have been possible for me.. ..if all of you wouldn't have been there for me. Thank you. Thank you so much, friends. Don't be formal, Abhi. - Yes. We are always there for you. Abhi. - Yes? I am leaving. I have a shooting at night hour. - Okay. Listen. No one should know that father is alive. Hey, no, no. You didn't have to tell me about this. He made me my card. Today, I am a junior artist supplier. It is all because of his blessing. I can do everything for him. Tell me if need be. I am leaving, brother. - Yes, yes, please leave. I am leaving. "What is my name?" "My name is Sheila." "Sheila's youth." "Sheila.." "I am too attractive for you." "Sheila's youth." "You wouldn't be able to get hold of me." "No, no, no, no, Sheila." "I am too attractive for you." Oh no. "Sheila's youth." "I am.." Bunty used to listen to this song all the time. "My name is Sheila." "Sheila's youth." "I am too attractive for you." "You wouldn't be.." He went out of my hands. Brother, it wasn't right on your part to come to Mumbai at this time. Brother.. - Hey! I don't need suggestions. You were supposed to find out the one who has killed my brother. The whole of police department is very alert.. ..after Guru Talwar was killed, brother. I cannot find out new information. No, no, no, no. I don't have a habit of listening to a no. I want the name of the one who has killed Bunty. His name! Hail Lord. Sunanda! Abhi! Sunanda.. - Brother! Brother.. - Look here. What happened? - Brother is conscious. Brother.. - He has regained consciousness. Brother! Brother, can you see me? Brother, it is me.. - Hey, has anyone informed Abhi? What? - Yes, call him, call him. Go, go, go.. - Yes, go fast. Make it fast. Abhi. Abhi! - Yes? Come fast. Brother has opened his eyes. Father! Debda. Look there. Your son. Abhi! Father! What is this? Indrani! Sunanda. - Yes. Yes? Come. - This is.. I don't see Anshu anywhere. Anshu is.. What is the matter? Why are you quiet? What happened to Anshu? Debda. Actually Anshu is.. - Hey! Tell him the truth. Father wouldn't mind at all. Uncle has gone to America, father. - What? Yes. America? - Anshu has gone to America? Yes, father. Uncle has got a good job in America. He really wanted to come when he heard that you have come back. But he cannot come because of a visa problem. No, no, there is no need to hurry. Make a phone call to him. I want to talk to him. Debda. I wanted to say that.. ..it is midnight there at the moment. Maybe he has gone off to sleep. Talk to him in the morning. But it will be midnight here. And Debda will be asleep by then and then.. - Hey! What? Hey, uncle.. Uncle is right. Call him right now. I haven't spoken to him for so long. Call him. Why do you speak rubbish and create a mess? Should I say something else and try to cover this? Let it be. What? Hello, uncle? This is.. This is Abhi. One minute. Father wants to talk to you. What? Great. I am doing great, dear. Everyone is here. Why wouldn't I be well? Did he do planchet? How are you? I am fine, brother. I will come there as soon as possible. You take care of yourself. Don't worry about me. Take care of your visa problem and come here quickly, okay? Okay, brother. - I am hanging up. Here you are. Today.. Today I am very happy. Hey, everything seems like a haze to me. - Oh no. Hey Akhilesh. - Yes? Anand. - Yes? I want to meet my people once. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Father. - Yes? You wanted to meet all of them, right? Yes. They are here to meet you today. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Hey! He looks like the original Debraj Rai, Babla. He is doing the character of Debraj Rai. So do you think he will look like you instead of Debraj Rai? Yes. - Give the slogan. Hail. - Hail, hail. Are all of you doing well? Yes. - Yes. Why should we worry if we have an MLA like your son? Does your MLA stand by you all the time? He is better than you too. - Yes. He comes whenever we need him. - Yes. Get well soon, brother. We will have this revolution with you. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. Debraj Rai. - Hail. Hail. MLA Abhiraj Rai. Today, I feel proud because of you, sir. We haven't ever lied to brother, Abhi. We used to feel very sad when we couldn't talk to brother for so long. But it hurts more to lie. While standing in front of the mirror.. ..when I have to put the vermilion on my forehead.. ..although my husband is dead.. ..I feel my chest will burst any moment, Abhi. Do you think it doesn't hurt me? The doctor has said that I need to keep father happy all the time. I don't have the capacity to get the moon for father. Hence I have got the reflection of the moon.. ..on the mirror and I am trying to keep father happy. You.. Please support me a little. Please. Reality show? Have you seen Big Boss? - Yes. The same on in which Shilpa Shetty won 3 crores, right? Oh God, it is a wonderful matter. Yes. - You mean, in a house.. ..everything has to indulge in love and fights. And someone makes decisions from a hidden place. Yes. - Yes, you are absolutely right. I see. - And here, the decision will be made.. ..by the great teacher, Mithon Chakraborty from a hidden place. Really? - Absolutely. Wow, this is great. - Yes. So what is your concept? Debraj Rai is alive. - What? And now instead of him.. ..the MLA is his son. Abhiraj Rai. How does he see this? How happy he is. How does he handle different kinds of problems? And all of these will be watched.. ..by our secret cameras. Secret camera? - Yes, camera. Where is it? Look there. That side. What? There is one there as well. What is it? - Since the show is about Debraj Rai.. Yes? - The cameras will work for as long as he is there. Yes. - All the characters will have to keep on acting. Okay. - Yes. They can relax for the rest of the time. I see. So how are you using me here? I mean, what is my character? What do you want to do? Positive or negative? Of course negative. Positive doesn't have anything. Yes. - Your first shot. Sharp at eleven. Eleven. Outside alert. Outside alert. Father is coming. Sir, I had taken 25,000 as a loan.. ..from Swarna Kamal for my daughter's wedding. Today, he is asking me to pay the whole amount.. ..or write my land on his name. Okay. So where is that fool? Here I am. I am here. Hey! What did you think? You would get saved if you complain to the MLA? Yes? 10 or 20 of such MLAs are always in my pocket all the time. You have come to a wrong place.. ..and showing your power to a wrong person. Will you pay his money or not? Even you are speaking in front of wrong people and audience.. ..and speaking wrong dialogues. This is my business. Interest on interest. And I will levy more interest on interest. Thrashing on top of thrashing. And again thrashing on top of thrashing.. ..will help you get rid of your wishes. Hey, what will you do to me? Hit me? Try to hit me if you can. With around four henchmen.. ..you feel you have become someone great? All those days are gone. One is as powerful as much money he has. Hey! Quiet! Hey, old man. Why are you getting bothered? Why are you staring at me? I will pull your eyes out. Who is that man? Hey! What is this.. - Careful. What is this? I will be thrashed as well? Actually I wanted to say that you are.. ..showing down the hero by your acting. Yes, I will do that. Yes. So the hero has to slap you and crush you. Or else, this is meaningless. Oh yes, yes. Listen, you have to go close and say something. Or else, it will be out.. -Yes, yes. You have to go. I am very happy with your work. Will you work for me as a hired goon? Yes? Hey, what is this? My head is tossing and turning.. Did you see that.. - Oh no, what is this? Yes, yes. - He is right. Hey, the father's son is like soldier's horse. Oh no, no, no, no. Hey! He must get the money by tomorrow. Or else, I will skin you alive by thrashing you hard. 'In order to become a hero in front of Mithoon..' '..he might kill me in reality.' 'But even I am a true player.' What happened? Will you give it or.. - I will give it. I will give it, I will. Hey, I will give it, I will give it. I will give it. I will give all the money. Spare me. Yes. Now you may leave. - Yes. Go and ask for forgiveness from him. Yes, I am going. Where is the old man? Oh yes, I forgot. Sir! Hey, sir. Listen. The money made my whole body hot. That is why I said rubbish to you. Forgive me, sir. Okay, okay, try to serve people better from now on. Go. - Yes. One minute. You put up a good act of doing good for people. What? But how much ever you want to show off your expressions.. ..the great teacher will give me the prize. Oh no, what is this? - Hey! What is this? - Hey Abhi. This fool hasn't changed yet. Thrash him more.. - Oh my God. Outside relax. Sit down. Hey listen. - Yes. Okay, what did you tell him that he slapped you so hard? Hey, what would I tell him? I said that he is acting well. - Oh God. Oh no.. -Why? Shouldn't I say it? Hey, brother, this was your mistake. - Why? You shouldn't call any artist good in front of the camera. - I see. Audience will decide who is doing well or not. - Yes. And our great teacher. I see. - Yes. Anyway, forget it. Can you see that camera there? Go and ask for votes there. What? - Or how would audience vote for you? Yes. - Go, go, go, ask for votes. Ask for votes. Yes.. - Go. Hi, I am Swarna Mahal. Vote for me if you liked my acting. Mahaguru. And then send Mahaguru and put a space. Then write Swarna Mahal and send it to 5535. Greetings. Many members of the gang members have been arrested. There have been many explosives and arms found from them. There has been a big accident in Delhi too. We will arrest this criminal very soon. And I will bring him to justice. Hey! What is it? You said that you don't have a network in Kolkata. So what is this? There are some networks with which brother deals directly. I don't know about them. If brother comes to know that I am alive.. ..he will skin all of you. Even I want your brother to come here. I am ready to welcome him. He doesn't know anything about the Kolkata network. This news has to be given to the commissioner. Don't break the protocol. Have you ever seen Ajit jump over.. ..Byomkesh Bakshi and make the communication with.. ..the high levels on his own. I will tell him everything that has to be said. Please go out. Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Bakshi, tell me. Good morning, sir. Yes, Bunty said there is no network in Kolkata. So I don't think there is a need to send a team to Kolkata, sir. Mr. Bakshi, give the phone to Abhi. Okay, sir. One minute, sir. Take it. No, sir, it is fine, please talk. There is no problem. No, no, sir, it is okay. Sir respects the seniors. That is why he wants the juniors to do all the work. He gives the instructions to them. Take it. Yes, sir. Well done, Abhi. According to the information found from Bunty.. ..we have raided the place of Guru Nayak.. ..and have been able to uproot his network considerably. Have you decided what you are going to do next? I need to look through a few things in Kolkata. And then I will understand where the real problem lies. Okay, okay, carry on. Hasn't it recovered yet? You feel this is funny, right? It is very funny! What are you saying, sir? Now what.. Yes, tell me, dear. Hello, father. Where are you? Will you please drop me from home to the temple? Okay, fine, stand there. I am coming. By the way, what does your daughter do? We are looking around. We have got a lot of good alliances. What about your girlfriend? How did you know about my girlfriend? Wow. My name is Madhusudan Bakshi. But I like the detective Byonkesh Bakshi. I know everything. A beautiful girl from Malaysia. She has taken away everything. Hey, are you angry? - We are here. I see. There she is. Father. - Yes. Offerings. Give it. Give some to him as well. Abhi is my junior. And she is Puja. My elder daughter. Hi. I had not expected this much too. What didn't you expect? This. Your daughter. Temple. Veneration. - I see. Yes. I have brought them up well. Now look here. Some days back, she went to Delhi.. ..and answered an IPS exam. Like your cheating girlfriend.. ..without telling me.. ..she didn't go to Malaysia for a fashion show. Do you know, dear? Sir went to Malaysia and fell in love with a beautiful girl. That is it. He was cheated. Whom did you fall for, Abhi? Despite staying here, I understood that.. ..the mother and daughter were both cheats. And you didn't understand despite staying there? And the father is another fool! He doesn't even know. Where has his daughter gone? What is she doing? This is strange! Father, please. Can we not have this discussion at the moment? And think about the girl. She has cheated her father and him as well. And after this, when she has kids, she will cheat them too. Thank God I don't have a cheating daughter like that. What would you do if you did? Now.. - Will you please keep quiet now? Why, dear? What happened? We.. We are home, father. I see. Come in, come in, come inside. Dear, where are you going? Sit here. Hey, you don't have to feel shy in front of him. He is my junior. Sit down. Listen. I had to go to the supermarket. Should I go? What is the need to ask? Go. I haven't stepped out of the house without telling you. Did you hear that? Since the time we got married.. ..she hasn't been able to answer me back ever. The same tradition has been going on for the last 22 years. Sir, ask madam to raise her head a bit. Have you modeled madam the same way, sir? Hey, forget it, not everyone has to be modeled. Some people just get molded because of the company. Is everyone like the mother of your cheating girlfriend? She lied to her husband and went to visit Malaysia? She will say everything and do it. Father. - Yes, come dear. My younger daughter. Sir, you spoke about my girlfriend. You spoke about girlfriend's mother too. Speak about her father once. The lesser said about him, the better. He is a fool. He is at fault. Or else, does someone's wife and daughter.. ..lie and go out ever? There are. There are many fools like this. He thinks he is someone great. Actually he is not someone great. He doesn't have his feet on the ground ever. He is always on the branches. And.. - Stop it, father. Abhi. - Yes? You are insulting my father on purpose. Hey, what happened? Tell me clearly. I will tell you, sir. - What? The girl I fell in love with in Malaysia.. ..was none other than your daughter Puja. You are right, sir. Her father is at fault. Your daughter has won out of 12 countries. You couldn't understand your daughter's talent ever. That is your fault. But madam didn't make that mistake. Puja couldn't tell you about her profession to.. ..you because of her fear but today, she has spoken. Do you know the reason, sir? Because she wouldn't let her father get insulted by anyone. She loves her father as much. I know my limit, madam. But sometimes, one has to cross limits to do something good. I am sorry. I want to talk to my family. Will you please excuse us for a minute? - Yes, sir. Father, I thought.. I used to think.. ..it is a father's duty to keep his children in discipline. But I didn't understand that I had brought in.. ..such a strict discipline that.. ..our daughter was scared of sharing her moment of happiness with me. Do as you feel. But please let me know. I mustn't come to know from an outsider. And there is something else. This boy is very dangerous. His operation and love. Both are dangerous. Handle him carefully.. - Yes.. All the best. Come on. - What? Yes, sir. "Hey heart, listen to me." 'Let us go to the religious place." "Will you swing on the lover?" "Hey heart, listen to me." 'Let us go to the religious place." "Will you swing on the lover?" "Hey, save me." "Hey, save me." "Beautiful thief has entered my heart." "The cop has fallen in love with the thief." "Hey cop." "The cop has fallen in love with the thief." "Hey heart, listen to me." 'Let us go to the religious place." "Will you swing on the lover?" "Hey heart, listen to me." 'Let us go to the religious place." "Will you swing on the lover?" "Hey, listen, cop." "Hey, listen, cop." "I have got a fool. Your police has been entrapped." "My heart has loved him." "Hey, cop." "My heart has loved him." "Fire. The fire of love." "I have the spring of love in my eyes all day." "In the breeze." "I am floating in the breeze." "In the maze of dreams with you." "Fire. The fire of love." "I have the spring of love in my eyes all day." "In the breeze." "I am floating in the breeze." "In the maze of dreams with you." "Listen, oh my God!' "Listen, oh my God!' "Please help in the love affair of thief and police." "Make us sit in the wedding altar." "Hey, teacher." "Make us sit in the wedding altar." "The kohl." "The kohl of your eyes." "It plays a drum in my heart." "Mad. I have gone mad." "And hence the showers make me wet." "The kohl." "The kohl of your eyes." "It plays a drum in my heart." "Mad. I have gone mad." "And hence the showers make me wet." "Hey, is everyone listening?" "Hey, is everyone listening?" "Listen careful. The colors of youth have come by." "The affair of thief and cop has started." "Hey, cop." "The affair of thief and cop has started." "The wedding revelers are dancing the Punjabi dance." "The son-in-law has come in the police van." "All the cops have cast the evil eyes away." "The affair of thief and cop has started." May Suraj live for ages! What is it? Why do you look so tensed? Interpol has informed me. Guru Naik is in India. And on the other side, I am getting through the commissioner too. Hello. Interpol has given the information that I am about to come. And I have started my work. If you want to see the commissioner alive.. ..get my brother alive to me till time doesn't run out. Alone. I will come alone. But if something happens to the commissioner in the meanwhile.. ..I will kill each on his respective position at the moment. Go straight on the way to the factory. Turn right. Turn left. I don't see anyone before I kill anyone. But I wanted to see you before I kill you. Do you know the reason? When my henchman told me that you look like a Hollywood hero.. ..I had slashed him in a fit of anger. Fool! He told me the truth before he died. You are just like that. Hollywood hero. In the last twenty five years.. ..I have made bomb blasts in twenty six places. I have made 24 police officers leave their posts. There are 130 cases pending against me in India and abroad. Interpol of 16 countries have given our orders to arrest me. But none of them could do anything to me. Even you wouldn't be able to do anything. This is my track record. Let Bunty go. Hey fool! I haven't come here to give your brother back to you. I have come to take you both tied to the same rope. I am a gold medalist in IPS. While I was anti-goon squad.. ..I have killed 46 people in encounter. There is no account of people I have killed in undercover operations. They are killed and all the cases have been covered under the carpet. In India and abroad, I have closed 226 cases. I have done all this in just five years. And all of this is not just my track record. This is world time record. World time record. World time record. World time record. Okay, you have guts. Your voice can be heard despite standing in front of Guru Nayak. My blood group is a little different. There are very few people like me in Bengal. They shake the very base of the whole world. Hey, Mumbai police will be shaken now. Your commissioner is with me at the moment. I will kill him any time I want. Hey, snacks vendor. Look there. Didn't I warn you? Inviting me is like inviting trouble. Are you wondering how I played the game? Come on, we will go into flashback mode now. Go that side. Are you fine, sir? Come. Let us go. Let us go. Come on. When I have three minutes with me, I think. When I have two minutes, I thrash. And if there is one minute, pack up! Oh no. Hey! Throw the gun down. Throw the gun down or I will kill him. Don't leave him because of me, Abhi. Do your duty, Abhi. No! No, Abhi. No, Abhi. No! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Abhi. - Sir. I had given word to my son.. Brother! We will not spare the criminals. Brother! I am leaving you. Are you fine? I have faith. You wouldn't spare them. Come on. Yes, sir. - Don't spare them. Yes, sir.. - Yes. Sir! Sir! Hey, come fast. Come fast! Hey! Come on. Come on. Hey! Hey! Brother, stop. Brother, stop! Please. Come on. Come on. Brother, stop. Brother, stop! Hey brother.. - Run! Come on. Oh brother.. - Run faster. Brother. Bunty! Akhil. - Shibu. You are working for Guru Nayak? Do you know whom you wanted to kill? He is Debda's son. - Abhi? Kill me. Kill me, Akhil. Get up. Uncle Shibu. You were the closest aide of father. You considered father as God. And you started working for Guru Nayak? I am not a part of the gang of Guru Nayak. Debraj sir. I had sent for the medicines going by the doctor's prescriptions. The boy's body went cold on having the medicines once. Brother. The doctor said that this boy died.. ..because of having fake medicines. And we have information that Apurbo Ghosh.. ..has set up the factory of those medicines here.. ..in association with a mafia gang of Mumbai. Burn it.. - Come on, burn it down. Burn it.. - Come on, burn it down. Because of your factory of fake medicines.. Even if you would have spent your entire wealth for this kid.. ..you would not be able to return the kid back to his parents. Stop your business of fake medicines. Or you and your brother Madam.. ..will be sent to jail by me. The branches of my business are spread over a lot of cities. If any politician tries to do away with those branches of mine.. ..the matter is very clear. He needs a share of the profit. How much? Hey, listen. Debraj Rai is not a mean politician. He is a mass leader. He is the leader for people. I had thought that the matter will be solved with a glass of water.. ..and a cup of tea. If someone tries to create problems for our work.. ..we reach a compromise with them. And if that fails too.. Hey.. - Hey, you! Anshu. I think he hasn't found out the information on me.. ..and got down on the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose airport. I give one chance to everyone to change their behavior. Cut off the roots of all the branches that you have in West Bengal. Or you wouldn't get a second chance. Your fake business and you.. ..will be done away with together. Go away. Get out, I say. 'After that meeting with him..' '..we left for Kolkata with Debda.' What is happening? - Actually.. What has happened to you? Brother, I was feeling a little sleepy. Splash some water on your eyes. Park the car on the side. What? - Park it aside. Brother! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Brother. - Anshu! Run away with brother. I will take care of them. Run away. - Yes. Brother! Hey! Hey! Hey, stop. Hey, stop. As soon as I got the news, I went running to your house. But when I got there, I found out.. ..that you have sold off your house.. ..and have left Debnagar. That was the time I decided that I wouldn't spare any of them. I will kill each one of them. Till date, Debraj Rai was stuck in my throat like a fish bone. Now that the bone is gone.. ..the food has gone in smoothly. - Yes. Hey! I will bury you all alive here, you fools! By joining forces with them.. ..you have killed Debda! Hey! In the jail, I found out from an inmate. Guru Nayak has come to Mumbai. I went to Mumbai to kill him and I got hold of his brother Bunty. I had thought that I will get Guru Nayak if I keep Bunty entrapped. And I will kill him. Maybe Debda's spirit would be pacified with that. Shibu. Debda hasn't been killed. Debda is alive. Why didn't you tell me all this for so long? Because of fear. Anshu was no more and Debda was in coma. And what if they had done something to you? And that is why, because of fear.. ..we took you and Debda to Mumbai. So that you are not harmed in any way. Shibu. - Debda. Son. Son. You are old. But you are the same, Debda. Krishna. Jaga. Where are all of them? They have gone to Varanasi to offer veneration on your name. Are they doing well? Yes, yes, brother. Anshu will come back from America. All of us will have fun together again. Come. Come inside. Come. Abhi, don't spare the ones.. ..who have killed Anshu so heartlessly.. ..and rendered your father in this condition. I will not spare anyone, uncle. I will cheat them the way they backstabbed father. I will earn their trust first. And then I will play with that. I will kill them in a way.. ..that will make them repent before dying.. ..that why were they born in my area. After the murder of the scoundrel commissioner.. ..the whole of Mumbai is on red alert. Situation is very critical. Brother, it would be correct to take.. ..shelter at Cool's house. All my life I have stayed in five star hotels like a king. He has brought me down to the streets.

Let me tell you something, sir. For the sake of your movie. For the sake of this hero, please agree, sir. Really? - Yes. But.. Who will buy so much of land? There is someone. Minister Keshto Mitra. He is my brother. He is such a fool. He has cheated the public of so much of money. He invests in everything that he lays his hands on. I see. He goes from one land to another like a fly. Think about it, sir. Your money is ready. Even your movie is ready. Because of the money of the land.. ..you can make the movie nicely. Think about it. Tell me. Action. - Hey!

Listen, I have seen your clippings. Even my children have seen them. Excellent performance. Excellent. Mimo said that Uttam Kumar has come back. Yes. - Yes. But your role is very small in Debraj Rai's reality show. They haven't used you properly. What should I say, sir? Tell me. All the small artists are getting big roles. And no one is even looking at us. Hey, I have decided that I will do a reality show on my own. And you will do the main character in that. - I see. And my show will be telecast before that show. Even the prize money is double. 4 crores. What? - Okay. And remember one thing. Don't tell anyone. No! I have decided that you will be assured winner. My assistant will reach you in some time with the concept. Okay, sir. Okay, okay, okay. - Yes. Come. When God gives something, he gives everything in excess, darling. Open it. - No. Hey, no, no. Not my buttons. Open the door. I see. Why are you scolding me? I am opening it. Oh no, she is a fool. Greetings. - Greetings. Is Kamal here? Yes, there he is. Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings. Yes, greetings. Greetings. - Greetings. Sit, sit down. - Greetings. Tell me. What is the concept of your new reality show? What? How did you know, sir? That we are here to talk about the new reality show? In fact, it was only last night that.. ..Mithoon thought of this whole thing. And just a while back, the great teacher.. ..informed me about me on the phone. What are you saying, sir? Mithoon called you? So there is no need to be surprised. Only gems know gems. Yes. What is the concept? Actually the concept is about buying and selling a land. Mafia versus Land. Title is great. It has the essence of a twenty-twenty match. Yes. What is my character? Singapore's Haridas Pal. Who is that? He is a millionaire. Millionaire. The man has a lot of money but he is very simple. But he is very dangerous if he is angry once. Exactly. Same. Same. Same.

Hey.. - And yes, some real people will be working in this show. Don't get scared at all. No, no. This is a pen camera. There is a camera fitted to it. Pen camera? Yes. Hey, this will record what everyone is doing. - I see. Now assume that you have a camera in the pen. And someone will have it in the watch. Someone will have a camera in his collar. And yes, someone might have it in the shirt's button too. When does the shooting start? From tomorrow. Welcome, welcome, welcome. He is my friend, Ruidas Pal. He is the nephew of Haridas Pal.. ..a millionaire of Singapore. We are so lucky that we have got a chance to shake hands with you. Now sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. So? Let us serve our guests now. Right? I will be the one hosting you. Meaning? I.. - No, I mean, uncle is trying to say.. ..that all the expenses will be borne by him today. I am right, uncle. Isn't it? Didn't I tell you? He is Haridas Pal from Singapore. Star! Hey! Don't talk rubbish and get the drinks. I will get them. While the drinks are being served.. ..let us talk about business, okay? Yes. - Yes. Yes. - Okay. Uncle Hari is opening a seven star hotel in Singapore. And for that, he needs a lot of liquid cash. That is why he has decided to sell his 200 acres land in Bonga. Well, the valuation of that land is 5 crores per acre at the moment. But I have decided I will sell it off even if I get 3 crores. Was it right, nephew? You are doing alright till now. Cannot you lower it a bit, sir? I knew you are poor. But I didn't know you are a gang of beggars. It is okay. I will donate it for 2.5 crores. I hope the papers are on your name. If you have a doubt about his papers, he will feel bad. And if uncle feels bad.. ..the nephew will be very angry. And if I am angry.. - Everyone will be in trouble. Hey, forget him. Actually his papers weren't right when he was born. That is why he is always worried about papers. Here you are, sir. - Give it. Don't worry about the papers. I will send them in a few days. But will you be able to do it? Your appearance makes me doubt it. Hey, we are just the small fish. We have big power behind us. - Yes. Hey, who are you? I have come to know the name of the officer who has killed Bunty. Abhiraj Rai. He is in Kolkata at the moment. This is trouble! The one who has this picture becomes a picture. Bury this picture in the ground right now. Or else, you will also get buried in the ground. Hey fool.. - Sir. I will kill you.. - Hey Shakeel. Hey, Shakeel? - Hey.. Contract killer Shakeel. - What? When he was with me in the shelter.. - Yes. He had this picture in his hand and wanted to have kebabs. Kebab? - As soon as I gave him kebab.. ..there was a gong.. - Gong? The skull got upturned.. - Okay. There was blood on the kebab.. - What? The kebab was ruined.. - And? His picture is on the wall. There he is.. - I will kill him now. Hey, hey, hey, go on now. Go and get some tea. Go, go, go.. - Cool. Cool. - Not cool, cool. Hot! Hot! Cool. - Oh no. Cool! Cool. My brain is becoming hot on hearing the word cool from him. After killing the inspector, I will kill this Mr. Cool. But before that, can I get a phone? A phone? Arrange for the money as soon as possible by telling boss. Or else, we wouldn't be able to hold the party for too long. Boss. The man who has killed my brother.. ..and is making me run around like a dog.. ..is in Kolkata at the moment. I will fax his photograph. I need all his details. Send his photograph. I will get his corpse sent. But keep this secret within yourselves. No one should be able to hear this. No one except the partners will come to know of it. Don't worry at all. You are so restless all the time. When I see you, I feel someone is bothering you. Hey, hey, hey. Do something. - Here you are. Take tea. Take tea. - Take this photo and right away. Fax this photo to Kolkata right away. The fax number is written on this. At the end, you have decided that you want to die. Okay, will the body come here.. ..or will it be buried in Kolkata? Hey.. - Cool! Brother. This picture has to be faxed on this number. A nice man like this is making Guru Nayak run around like dogs? How was the game? He pointed the gun at me? It is a mistake. No, no, no, no. It is not right to create a mess of such men. The government will fire me if they come to know.. ..that I am involved in all this. In last year's veneration.. ..I had got Robi. Nothing seemed amiss to me. He was very polite and addressed me as brother. Hey, what should we do now? Let us give him excuses and bide time. And in the meanwhile, make the land deal final. The matter has to be dealt with care. It is Guru Nayak's money. Even if there is a small amount of problem with accounts.. ..we will have to account for a lot more. Jaga. - Yes, brother. You have a lot of boys working for you. Find out information if Haridas Pal.. ..from Singapore has land in Bonga or not. Abhi. Jaga is talking on the phone. Hello. Yes, tell me. Okay. Hang up now. I will look into it. Hello. Give the phone to Keshto. - Hey. I think the man has found out something. I cannot give this tension to Keshto. Then my film wouldn't get made. He is busy. Tell me whatever you want to say. Hey fool, this is Jaga here. Give the phone to Keshto. I don't care if you are Jaga or Gaja. After knowing the subject.. ..I will decide whether I want to give the phone to him or not. Tell him that Singapore's Haridas Pal doesn't stay in Bonga. I know that. - How did you know that? How can one man stay in Bonga and Singapore at the same time? Don't you have brains at all? I will smash your head into the wall and crush it. Give the phone to Keshto. I have already told you that.. ..I won't give the phone to him unless I know the subject matter. I am telling you nicely. It is very important. Give the phone to him. Hey, your matter is not clear to me. So how can I give the phone to him? Hey, I am telling you nicely even now. Give the phone to him. Fool! Give the phone to him. Hi. - Will you give the phone to him or not? This is called stroke of luck. The more I think I will be angry with you.. ..and I wouldn't speak to you.. - Give the phone to him. It just doesn't happen. Hello. Why are you looking here and there? Are you following someone? Okay, tell me. Don't you cops have any other work.. ..other than running behind thieves, goons and mafia? I cannot tolerate him anymore.. - What? Police! Police! - You don't have time to meet me. But all day, you follow thieves and robbers around. Where are all the people of the house? I have done all the calculations. It wasn't a right time for the ones belonging to Aries. Because of the effect of the planetary evil.. ..there is a chance of accident at the beginning of the year. That is why.. - What happened? Father. While coming back from Lucknow.. ..uncle Jaga has met with an accident. He is in a very bad state. - Oh God. Where is Jaga at the moment? Good boy. You got out in a drunken state. Where did you fall flat on your face? Yes. Were you flying in the sky? Yes? Hey, hey, what are you doing? - What? If you open it, he will die. I see. Why did Jaga go to the terrace of the shopping mall all of a sudden? I think there is something wrong somewhere. Attention. All of them are going upwards. Alert. Alert. Over. We just got that fool of Bonga in our hands. And this Jaga had to make this mess. That is why Rabindranath Tagore said.. ..that walk alone if no one pays heed to your call. Hey, keep quiet. You don't know the things you are supposed to say at a particular time. You are speaking about walking alone sitting inside an ICU. Have you informed his family? Yes, yes, I have. They are on their way. Sir, the doctor has called you right away. Come on, come on. - Come on. They are coming. Take. Take. Action. Action. Come on. Doctor. I cannot see my father in pain, doctor. - Yes. Either save my father or kill him. Why are you overacting? Oh yes. - Don't overact. We have tried our level best. Everything is not in our hands. You are right. But what should we do now.. - Oh brother. Greetings, brother. Oh uncle. He is uncle Jaga's son. - I see. Father said that when he comes back from Lucknow.. ..he would come to meet you when he gets time. God knows what happened! I am right here. I am right here. Sit. Please sit. I will go and inform the doctor. Tell him that minister Krishna Mitra has come. Hey, fast, fast. Doctor. How is the condition at the moment? The brain is completely damaged. He cannot talk. He cannot breathe. Assume that he is on the last stage. Father, I will just go and have a word with him. What is it? On seeing me, you are scared? If you are in this condition on seeing me.. ..then imagine.. Imagine how scared you would be when you know my father's name. My father's name is Debraj Rai. Before you get into the electric cremation machine.. ..just get this into your head.. ..that you will die at my father's hands. "Lord's name is true." Father. Uncle Jaga wanted to see you. "Lord's name is true." "Lord's name is true." I hadn't thought I will see you in this condition. Father. Uncle Jaga has a paper in his hand. What.. What is it? Is it hurting a lot, uncle? Debda, I knew you would come. I cannot take this pain anymore. Please open my oxygen mask with your hands.. ..and give me freedom. This is my last wish. Yes.. - Hey, what is this? Hey uncle. - Yes? Please keep my father's last wish, uncle. Kill father. There, he is saying it. - How can I do it? He is asking you to do it. How can I do this to Jaga? - Father. Uncle Jaga is in pain. - Yes. He wants to die at your hands. - Yes. Speak a few holy chants in his ears. Hey, swine. Do you know why I kept you alive? Because I wanted to kill you using those hands.. ..which had given you food once upon a time. You are not alone. I will send all of you up there. All the ones who have broken my father's trust. Pack up. Father. It is done. "Lord's name is true." "Lord's name is true." There was no one else like him. He used to finish the whole bottle of alcohol in one go. He never made any judgment where girls were concerned. Yes. - He used to love everyone equally. Why are you so sad? There is a share less. - Yes. Have you informed Biltu? I had called him. He is out of network coverage. I see. Look at what has happened. Yesterday.. We were talking so much yesterday. - Yes. And today, he is a mere picture. He was the one overseeing your uncle's land. He has made us sink. I can understand your pain. - Yes. But what can be done? Tell me. You cannot die along with him, right? - Yes. We should finalize this deal so that his soul can rest at peace. - Yes. I have kept all the documents and papers in this bag. I am giving this to Premjeet. After you are done with the rituals.. ..please check the papers. - Yes. Right. Right. You are right. Right. Yes. - Please keep this carefully. The land's papers are in this. - I see. After Jaga's ceremony, give this to them. - Yes. Okay. And yes, I have some good news. - What is it? Koel Mallick has agreed to do this movie. "Liar." - Really? - Yes. She jumped when she saw your pictures. And do you know what she said? He is super attractive. "It is a 100% love, love, love." - Super hot. And yes. And to do this movie, she has left three other movies. Among them, she had a movie with Hrithik Roshan movie too. "Love, love, love, love, love." - All the best. "It is a 100% love, love, love." Father. - Yes? How are you feeling? Are you very busy? I don't get to know when you are leaving and coming back. No, father. There is pressure at work. Yes, it is a police job. He is under pressure all the time. Abhi works with the police? No, no, father. Uncle isn't talking about me. What is it, uncle? Tell him. - What? No, no, no, I am talking about his father-in-law. Abhi's father-in-law. Would be.. Would be. Our Abhi loves a girl from Mumbai. Her father. He is a very big police officer. He has a wish of having an MLA son-in-law. I see. You have kept such big news hidden from me? How does the girl look? She is quite good. Quite? What kind of an answer is that? No, no, I want to see daughter-in-law once. Get daughter-in-law once. Okay? Okay. - Hey! Why didn't you tell me for so long? Now look. I wouldn't squeal so easily. Yes. Hey Shibu. Shibu! Shibu. Hey Anand. - Yes? This was the first time you gave out a secret and.. ..did something useful. Good. - What? Abhi. - Yes? Brother would be happiest when you get married. Your wife should come at the same time as the Goddess. What is it? What did you think? I wanted to talk to Puja. Puja has her father above her head as her umbrella. Place the subject matter first. We will talk about it when this gets approved. Puja. I don't sprinkle water on top of a plant. I sprinkle water on the roots. That is why I will tell you whatever has to be said. Even I am getting good alliances. Some of them have fathers who are ministers.. ..joint CP, magistrate.. Compared to that, your father is.. Anyway, good or bad.. ..I will marry you. I have fallen in love. If you have fallen in love too.. ..ask the head to settle the rest. Is this proposing or setting the criminal and making him confess? He is so rude before marriage. How will he be after marriage? You have come into the wrong house. Forgive me. He has come to the right house, father. I love this rude man. What? I will marry him if I have to. He is insulting you throughout in front of my eyes. And you want to marry him? Father. Please listen. - Oh no. No. Listen. - What is it? That is his problem. - What? He thinks he is a bigger police inspector than you. Yes. And not just that, he thinks he is smarter than me too. That is why girls are queuing up for him. He is too proud of himself. Hey, that is the reason I want to marry him. I see. I will get him down to the earth. - I see. But what if he doesn't want to get down to earth? And keeps feeling proud of himself? Don't worry, I am your daughter. - Yes. I will show him Malaysia's colors and get him down. You are truly Byomkesh Bakshi's daughter. Okay, I don't have a problem.. ..since both of you are in the same knot now. But there is a condition. - Okay. I will meet your family first. And then I will decide if clarinets will play in your wedding. Or violin. Oh, why are you getting so restless? Let me do something. Let me tell them everything and ask them to co-operate with us. Impossible. You don't know that man. He is a different man altogether. If that fool comes to know that I have lied to my father.. ..he will never get me married to Puja. On the contrary, he will blame me for everything. I am scared because of Anand. He is a bigmouth. If the bigmouth speaks the truth.. ..we will be done for. I have got a way. For all this while, we have fallen into trouble because.. ..of uncle Anand being a bigmouth. But because of that bigmouth.. ..we will be saved from trouble now. Come. Did he tell you the time he is going to come? I don't know.. - He will come. He will come. Hey Abhi. Hello, sir. I hope you didn't have a problem while looking for the house. No, at the beginning, I thought I have come to the right house. Now when I have seen you, I feel a little confused. Why are you dressed like this? Are you a cop or an actor? Lower it. Lower it. Actually I want to tell you something.. ..before you meet my family, sir. - What? Actually I have an uncle. Uncle Anand. He stays here. But uncle is a little demented. He gets hold of each person each day. And for that day, we have to abide by what he says. And if we don't listen to him, he bites - What? What? Who is he after today? Me. - What? He says I am an MLA of Debnagar. And I have a chance of being the chief minister one day. Okay, that is all, right? Yes, sir. But there is something I want to say, sir. What? - You have to handle my uncle a little carefully. Hey, don't worry. Although my name is Madhusudan Bakshi.. ..I am Byomkesh Bakshi, the detective. I have handles thieves, robbers and goons all this while. Do you think I wouldn't be able to handle an ordinary mad man? Don't worry at all. - Thank you, sir. Hey. Come on. Too much. Yes, I didn't know at that time.. ..that I am the father of the girl. I was abusing myself. Greetings, greetings, greetings. Greetings. - Yes. - Who is he? I? I.. - Yes. I am Abhi's uncle. I see. I see. Okay, okay. - Yes. Greetings. Is everything fine? Yes, I mean.. I think the man knows everything about me. What is he asking about? Tell me. Abhi has told him that.. - Yes? You are after this marriage. He has told him? - Yes. That is why.. - That is the reason he looks so happy. He is the girl's father. It is a girl's responsibility. Okay, do they know everything about Debda? They know everything. - Yes. Don't say anything in front of everyone. Relative. I am not saying this because he is my own son. At such a young age, such brave leaders.. ..don't exist in West Bengal. I have heard that when he talks in the legislative assembly.. ..it gets shaken. I see. - Not just that. On seeing him, girls and boys don't want to take up jobs anymore. Really? - They are saying that they want to.. ..go to the legislative assembly as soon as they finish college. Not just the head. He has a problem with his eyes as well. Yes. Yes, he is on the T.V, papers.. He is always being.. Model. Model.. - Role model. Young generation thinks of him.. ..as the future Chief minister from now on. Why is your father-in-law winking at me? Wink? I see. No, no. He isn't winking. He has an ailment of the eyes. It closes on its own. I see. - Got it? The more younger people come to politics.. ..the better it is for the politics, right? Or else, the way the country is running like a slow train.. ..in some time, it will be dead. Hey. Abhi's father-in-law winked at me. What? - Have another glass of juice. Okay, are we at home or the legislative assembly? Can we leave politics aside and finalize the wedding date? Right, right. Relative. - Yes? I was saying that we should finalize.. ..the wedding date as soon as possible. Yes, as soon as you finalize the date.. ..we have to go to Delhi to invite Manmohan and Sonia. We will take you too. We will introduce you. We are regular visitors to their place. 'It is okay up to Manmohan and Sonia.' 'After this, he will say that Barrack Obama will come..' '..for Abhi's wedding.' 'I think he might bite me if I say that I won't go.' Sure. I will go wherever you ask me to go. Okay, shall we leave? Yes? - Yes. Okay. Please leave. - We are leaving. Please come to our house once. Okay. - We will come for sure. Abhi, we are leaving. - Come, come. This side. Please. Come on. Anand. - Yes? Even I will take you somewhere for invitations. Amitabh Bacchan. - What? We go to his place regularly. Brother. Brother. Brother, cancel this wedding. Why? Didn't you like the girl? The girl is good. But the father? Father was winking at everyone like an uncouth man. Hey, no, her father has an eye ailment. Abhi has told me. Does the girl also have a habit of winking like her father? Yes? - This is something different. Hey, get down from the car. - Why? Hey, I asked you to get down, get down. - Hey, don't talk rudely. Hey, get down. - Hey! Hey, I am telling you to get down.. - Let go. Hey, move. Brother, where is Sonajuri? That side. That side. This side? Then go that side. Hey! Get out. Let go. Be cool! Cool. Cool? Inside. Oh greetings, brother Guru Nayak. Greetings. I have seen God after a long time. You have lost a lot of weight. Don't speak rubbish and tell me about the one.. ..whose picture I had sent you. We get information on him everyday. - Yes. He has gone abroad with his family. And will come after the veneration. - Yes. I have to give you some other news, brother Guru. What is it? - There is a land in hand. In Bonga. 200 acres. We will get the registry done if you give consent. Yes. Okay. Look at the papers carefully and make the deal final. - Okay. We have the papers in hand. You can call your lawyer. Prem. - Yes. Tell me. Where are the papers? Which papers? - Of the land of Bonga. The ones which were given to you by Haridas Pal's nephew. When? When was it? Hey, what do you mean by that? The day Jaga died. He gave the papers to you. Hey, I have forgotten where I have kept them. What do you mean, fool? You have forgotten them? - Hey, hey.. Did you forget them.. - Why are you hitting him? You are going overboard. - Don't touch me, I say. Look, brother.. - Hey, quiet. You will fall into trouble.. - Please calm down. Quiet. - Yes. Don't say a word. - Don't hit me. You are joking around here? - Stop. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Do you want to die by hitting him? Have you forgotten that you have had two heart attacks? - What? The doctor has asked you not to get excited. Come on, come on. Come on right now. I will get the papers again. - Come on. He shouldn't come in front of me again. The swine. I had thought I will get all the money from brother today. Okay. I said that I will get all the papers from uncle Keshto. Or else I will get them from the court. Hey, that will happen after veneration. What if within ten days.. Forgive me, sir. Father. Father. - Father. Father. Father. Father. - Father. Father. Hospital.. - Take the car to the hospital. Make it fast. - Take it to the hospital. Father. You will have to come with me once. Where? Do you remember Apurbo Ghosh? - A.. Apurbo Ghosh? He had a business of fake medicines. Do you remember, brother? The one whose warehouse had been set to fire by us. Apurbo Ghosh is dead. How? Heart attack, father. Father. - Yes? Please sit here for some time. I will go and check where he is. Blood pressure is very high. Be careful about him. I will come tomorrow in the morning again. - Thank you, doctor. Did you hear what the doctor said, father? Keep lying here for some days peacefully. Or else you will be dead. Oh, why are you getting worried? We will take care of everything. Listen, the senior doctor is calling you. What is this? You? Hey, please stay with for me for some time, brother. I mean, till the time my sons don't meet the doctor and come back. Yes. Yes, yes. Even when Jaga passed away, this had happened. They had called us to meet the senior doctor. And when we came back, we saw that Jaga was dead. Do you think you will die in the similar way? In that case, you are right. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, are you joking with me? You are not my brother-in-law, or friend or pal. Why would I joke with you? - Hey, who are you? Who are you? Police. - What? IPS Abhiraj Rai. Son of Debraj Rai. - I see. I feel like putting the gun inside your mouth.. ..and shooting off all the bullets into your stomach. Fool.. - Hey, no, no. I want the God like man, whom all of you wanted to kill.. ..give you your death. He.. - Jaga is dead. Now you will also die.

On seeing you dance in the picture, uncle was very happy. Why did you do it? A world. One that doesn't have an existence. Why did you create a false world like that? For making me forget everything. So that father is fine and happy? In order to say one lie, you have got so many lies in. But even in all these lies, there is one truth. I am fine. And I am very happy. When you needed me the most, I wasn't with you. I couldn't do anything as a father. Then why are you doing so much for me? Tell me. Who has given this life to me? Every father wants love from their sons. And my son has given me so much of love. It wouldn't be enough even if I was born 100 times. I have got a lot. I have got a lot. Brother. - Father.. - Brother. Father. - What? Why are you getting scared? Even God doesn't have the strength to take my son away from me. All sons have their father's love on them as umbrellas. And I am the first father who has his son's love on his head. Yes?
