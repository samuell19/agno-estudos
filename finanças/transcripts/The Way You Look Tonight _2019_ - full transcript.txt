I just mentioned it casually to him and he was really pissed off at me. One minute he's nice and the next minute he's going crazy. - What? I don't what the deal is. - Right? - It all came out at once. - You know, I met a girl - last week in this place. - What? no! She said she'd absolutely never... Oh, my God she said that? Hello there. Oh, hi. I like your jacket. Thank you, uh, I found it at a thrift store. I got it when I started teaching 'cause it makes me feel like a professor. But look, someone sewed on patches. Oh, that's great. Uh, what university do you teach at? I... actually, I don't teach at the college level. Oh, I'm sorry, what high school? What subject? I teach kindergarten. Oh, well, that's really nice. Thank you. Listen, you are also very nice, but I'm actually supposed to meet someone else here. Oh, I'm so sorry. Good luck. Uh, Alex, honey, can you send a bottle over to those friends at table three please. It's, uh, their anniversary, thanks. You got it, boss. Hi there. Ellie? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, good luck. - Hey, girl, what can I get for you? Uh, I will have... - one of those please. - Sure thing. So, you like whiskey? Is that what that is? I've never really had it before but it looks cool when other people drink it, so. Thanks. That is definitely... brown. Hello, lovely, so good to see you. How's everything tonight? Any trouble getting in? No, Todd recognized me. Great, and I see you brought a friend. Alex, this round's on me. You guys enjoy yourselves. Pretty popular I see. I'm, I'm glad that you could meet up on such short notice. Well, I just mean that, you know, most people, they, they don't meet up on the first day that they matched, so. I am not most people, I guess. And you didn't seem too scary. Well I, I can be tough. What gno... gnocchi? The g sort of just rolls off. I am so glad I didn't order it and sound like a moron. - Well, I've been saying gnocchi my entire life. - Gnocchi! How have you ordered it your entire life and never had a waiter set you straight? I don't know, well, maybe people think you won't tip if they correct you. My Mawmaw always used to call it potato dumplings. - Is that her? - Uh, yeah. She is my hero in a lot of ways. She got her PhD from Yale in educational psychology at 25. Some lady. Yeah. Some lady. What are you even doing on an app like that? - I could ask you the same thing. - No, no. My turn, my questions. I don't know, it's been hard navigating the dating scene. Since college really. Like, how do you even meet people in your 20's? I always thought I would go to grad school and meet my soulmate, but practicality set in. So you want to get your PhD. - Like your Mawmaw. - Yeah, she was more of an educational psychologist. Maybe that's how I ended up teaching the kiddos. I swear, every single one of them is probably worth their own little case study. Like Milly, she does this thing, she'll close her eyes. Okay, and I try to stop this, all right. She closes her eyes and someone will hand her a crayon. - Mm-hmm. - She bites into it and she guesses its color, okay. And she's right, like 100% of the time. - No way. - Yes, isn't that incredible? - Oh, my gosh. - It doesn't make sense. She's got to be clairvoyant or she has cracked the Crayola color matrix. Either way, people should know about it. They should, yeah. Sorry if that was like, 1,000% more than you wanted to hear. No, not at all. So... what's stopping you from going to grad school? It's just kind of hard to follow her up. Or... not the crayon eater, but my mam. I don't think she would think that. Maybe, it's just a lot of pressure, - if it doesn't work out. - Mm. What about you? Uh. I went to school online. For various reasons. What about high school? My mom home schooled me. She wouldn't let me leave the house. But sometimes when she went out I would walk around the neighborhood, it was me and Dad's secret. People would look at me like a stranger, but I'd been watching them my whole life. She found out, though, one time, it was... That was bad. It was her way of showing she loved me, I guess. I left when I was pretty young, it was just... it wasn't... It was, it was better for everyone. I went by the old house a couple times, it's on this corner lot in Cleveland and Knox. My dad still prunes the roses out front. I passed by him in the neighborhood one time and he didn't even know, it just... It's a weird thing to have your father look at you and not recognize you. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just talking about myself way too much. - I disagree. - Oh, I'm not, like, getting too real with you, we're not supposed to show the real us on the first date. And we're supposed to pretend that we don't fart, and that we really, really like trying new things... What's the point if it's not the real you? This is the real you, right? For the most part. Good. I like you. - Hey, bro. - What are you doing here, Mia? I thought it was cool to chill here between classes? - It's Saturday. - I thought you'd be at Mom and Dad's. Yeah, I have a study group later, and Jackson texted he was making brunch. Uh-huh, figured you might need the energy. Also, FYI the walls are a lot thinner when you're banging against them. - Ew. - So, uh, you and the lady want some breakfast? She's not here, Jack. - Oh. - Wait, did you see anyone leave this morning? - Sorry, I didn't get here til nine. - Yeah, prime ditching hours are usually around sunrise. - You have statistics on that? - I'm just speaking from experience. - Hey, where did you meet her? - This mobile app called Arouse. - Ooh. - Ah. - Yeah, no surprise there. - Oh-hoh. What? Wait, did she... Her profile disappeared. What do you expect on a pickup app like that? Oh, but especially Arouse, not a great track record, or dating pool in general. - So I've heard. - I don't know what you're talking about. Ellie was great. Okay, the app is fine, - I've been using it for months. - Look, maybe it's time to change tactics. Can you just give me a second, Mia. I seriously thought I had something real with this girl. The fact that you think that after one night just shows how emotionally starved you are. The best thing you can do right now is cleanse your palate. But, you know, pick from a different menu to extend the metaphor. I got to finish these pancakes. - What does he mean? - A different approach. Something with a proven track record, an extensive data to draw from, a fool proof algorithm. Like two other things. Hey, you know, I think I might have just the thing. Yeah. Have they updated this since 2003? Whatever. Done. You 100%? 'Cause that survey's not messing around. Man, I owe five good years of my life to that site. And two miserable ones. - Fucking Karen. - Yeah, all good here. Well, awesome just drop in a profile pic and, uh, start making matches. Remember, shirtless profile pic screams douche bag. Right. Okay, done and done. Look at that. What? 98% match. Is that good? I mean, yeah. That's, that's really good. I've never gotten anything over a 90. Uh, no, no way, no profile picture. That is a red flag. Why don't you try the next one down? Is that really any better? Well, at least put forth the effort to lie, you know. I hope I'm at least 30 before I'm that cynical, Jackson. Yeah, it was around that time, yeah. Okay, cool, she likes Pad Thai, loves animated films. I will message her. Okay, wow. Uh, she's online. What time do you start at the restaurant tomorrow? Uh, I start prep work at like five. Cool, what about you, Mia? I have class starting at seven. Good. Why? Just in case things go well. - Already? - You were the one who told me to cleanse my palate. Well, yeah, but I mean, Jesus, at least finish digesting the first one. Does that metaphor track? Can you believe it's been four months? What is congress doing? They need to press charges. Yeah, I have no idea. I need an ID, I need to apply for housing, I need to get passed a background check. - Hey, excuse me. - Hey, man, how have you been? - What can I get you? - You wouldn't have happened to see a girl around, Ellie? Maybe 5' 7", brown hair, uh, the bartender the other night - seemed to recognize her, so I... - Sorry, man, can't help you. Hey. Hey there. Uh, Lois? Oh, you look nice, that's a nice shade of green. - Can I get you a drink? - Uh, I'll have a whiskey on the rocks, single malt. - You got it. - All righty then, you know your stuff. Actually, I just started recently, but I'm getting into it. Thanks for meeting up with me like this, last minute. Uh, I teach so weekends are precious. - No problem. - I just mean that, you know, most people wouldn't be so accommodating. Well, I'm not most people. And you didn't seem too scary. You know, we come into the world so open, we're susceptible to wonder, uh, imagination, you know, the development of the mind is such a malleable thing, and I want to know what we gain and lose as we shape it. So... if that makes any sense? Yeah, yeah of course. That's what made me want to study it anyway. It is getting late. Oh, I hadn't noticed. It's just that I have to be at school tomorrow at seven to prep, so I should probably get to sleep. Oh, uh, - well, I thought that, uh... - Oh, what? Oh, no, err, I mean, you're very, um... you're super nice, I just don't usually do, uh, you know, uh, anything on the first date. Is that so, because I... What's so different now? - I'm sorry? - What is it you don't like about me? It's not anything about you. I really enjoyed talking to you, - I just, it's not... - I get it. - Can I walk you out? - No, it's all right, I'll show myself out. Tell me again why I can't message 98%? Because she's probably a dude or a robot... or Chris Hansen. No matter what, there's a high probability you're being catfished. - What? - Oh, that documentary where the guy meets a girl online - turns out it's not really her... - No, I know what catfish is, you can scam me with or without a photo. It's not like I'm giving out my credit card info. Buddy, just try your luck with some of those other girls in the 90's. Elise? Hey. Hey there. Can I get you something to drink? Uh, dinner should be ready in about 30. You know, my roommate's a chef, he lent me his recipe for the marinade, so it should be... Okay. Oh, that was... oh, my God. Elise, it's amazing how familiar that felt. I, I mean, a little aggressive but intuitive. It just felt right. Well, I don't mean to be... Are... What, are you cold? - You can have a shirt. - No, no, no, no, I, uh... I have to start work early, so. - I really like to sleep in my own bed. - What... What's happening right now? You're making me vocalize it, or have you never had a one night stand? Yeah, I guess I was just reading the situation, and there was something, like a real connection here. Yeah, well, you know, happens to the best of us, right? I don't know, I mean, I felt more than this. Maybe I'm just still reeling from this other girl awhile back. Either way I felt like there was something real here. Yeah, well. Better luck next time. I'm contacting 98%. - Peter. - She likes anti folk music, reads Alice Monroe... Peter, she is almost definitely a he. And he probably wants to imprison you like human sheep - and use your hair to make blankets. - She has a profile picture now. Okay, look. It's still ambiguous, but it's something. Huh, what is the deal with this green sweater trend? - Do you know, Mia? - What do you mean? Every girl I've gone out with since Ellie has worn some variation of it. It's the same shade of green too. - All of them? - Seemed that way. Was it the same sweater? I don't see how it could be, okay. - And what does this have to do with... - You should go for it. - What? - Yeah, you should go for it. Peter, this whole thing screams catfish. Trust me. Do you ever find yourself on a long stretch of road, you can see all the intersections ahead for a mile or so. All the lights are green, you probably think, "Oh, wow, it's an all go, straight through." But then you realize those lights will change before you get there, probably the nearest one first, with your luck. And then you'll sit at the light and watch the green road turn red. Now it's stop and go. All the way through. And I've learned from seeing that because the road is not really opened for you, it was opened for some driver before you who faced down red lights that changed at the last second, who raced through changing yellows and newly turned greens. I would rather see them all red, I think, because, yeah, maybe I'll have to stop when I reach them. But, hey, what if the first one changes and then the second, and then I look in the rear view at the green road behind me and think, "Now, wasn't that more interesting anyway?" Okay, I should probably tell you that I don't even have a driver's license, but it's a metaphor. It's the way I live my life. Hi, I'm Heloise. I have a habit of changing while the things around me stay the same. Hoping that's not a bad thing, just looking for someone to take a drive with me. Her apartment is at Jackstown and Vanguard, just in case she actually is a serial killer. Hope I don't die. Jackson, is there something you know that I don't? The sweater, hear me out. It's always the same sweater. Please be cute. Please be cute. Right. Hey there. Wha... Heloise? You... you look great. Oh, thanks. Sorry, where are my manners? - Please come in. - Yeah, thanks. Oh, are these from one of your books? Uh, yeah. That's awesome. Uh, so, you like pinot, right? Oh, perfect. I also have some whiskey in the pantry. Dinner should be up shortly. Do you want to come help me chop the onions? Uh, sure. What are we making? Sweet potato gnocchi. - This is really good. - It's not too chewy? I was distracted getting ready and I overcooked them. No, not at all. It reminds me of this restaurant I've been to a couple times. Leshy's? - Yeah. - I know the owner, they gave me the recipe. Well that is wild. Uh, yeah, I've been there a couple times. It's a shame I didn't run into you then. Yeah, I guess I just have one of those faces. I really don't think so. So do you, um, make those children's books professionally or? Ugh, no, unfortunately I do freelance advertising work. Oh, no kidding. There's a lot of interesting psychology that goes into that. What kind of stuff are you marketing? Well, it's not the most tasteful material. Oh, come on. I'd like to see some. This is what you do? To pay the bills, yeah. I, uh, I also compose the emails. - It's terrible, right? - I literally cannot think of a worse thing you could do. I mean, I can't work in parking enforcement for my apartment, the beauty is I can work remotely which is kind of necessary for me. And I'm pretty efficient at cranking these out. So I have more time for the books and stuff. Oh, speaking of which... can you show me what you're working on? Wow. This is awesome. Oh, is this from your Aphrodite bio? Yeah. It's this, um, whole explanation my dad had for why things in life are hard. I kind of thought it'd be a good little thing for kids to have. Yeah, it's great. So, have you thought about selling these, or. Yeah, um, I've been working on an e-store, but I mean... I don't know if kids would actually go for them. Oh, come on, this is amazing. Seriously. What if you, uh, read some of your stories to my class? I mean, if it goes well, which it totally will, you'd probably have a dozen pre-sales. Well, at the very least you'd have a... little focus group. I get it if you don't want to. That was super forward of me, I totally get it. No, no, no, no. I mean, yeah, yes, that... that sounds amazing. Do you want to grab some more wine? Still weird. I just don't know if they are really any good. I think so. Uh. These are all amazing. Thanks. Lately I've just been trying to figure out a look that will really connect with kids. Well, yeah, I think you're on to something, these pastels and rounded shapes are statistically prevalent in their nursery environments. Meaning what exactly? It just makes sense for them to develop an attraction based on associations from nurturing spaces. Sorry, that was a weird thing to say. - No. - Uh... No, that's awesome. I never would have thought of that, but it makes so much sense. I like the way you think. I like the way you see things. I had, uh... this thing happened to me a couple weeks ago and I've been trying and trying to get it out of my head. You're the first person to... you know, really make me forget about it. So, uh, thank you. We'll see how you feel about me later on. I'm not too worried. Like I said, we'll see. Oh, I'm sorry, uh. I didn't know Heloise had a roommate. - I'm Peter. - Yeah, I know. I, uh... So, did Heloise say where she went? Um... - she... - Did she say anything about wanting me to wait for her, or? Um... - Yeah. - Peter, listen. I... - Is this how she gets rid of her guys? - No, no, um. She... Uh, it's me. I'm Heloise. Well, I've had some bizarre encounters with women recently, but what this is... No, Peter, just listen. Uh... - let me show you something? - You know, if she wanted to ditch me then, we could have done my place. And she just could have bailed, seems to be - standard practice lately. - Peter, you know me. Honestly, unless you killed Heloise and filmed it on that thing, I don't have any interest in what you have to say. Someone recently told me about a little girl who can taste the color of crayons, so isn't anything possible? I promise it will be the most interesting thing you see all day. What is this? Just watch. I'm sorry I disappeared the first time. It's sort of standard operating procedure for us, but you were the first person I wanted to stay for. I figured I could always come back to your house and just tell you, but then when our Aphrodite profiles matched, it felt like something cosmic was at play. But... it didn't go as I planned. But then it just kept happening, and then the other night you said that you couldn't get me out of your head, which is a mutual feeling, and it made me so happy. But still, I was just really scared of fucking it up. But I guess I did that anyway, didn't I? Ellie? - Hi. - Okay. Okay, uh. - Okay. - I do go by Heloise, though. This must be a joke, right? I'm like on Catfish? I'm on Catfish, this is Catfish. What is Catfish? It's a show. You were them. You were... all of them. Why didn't you tell me the, the second time? - Or better yet, why not be upfront about it? - Well, it's not something that we like to broadcast, we have to be careful about the way we present ourselves on the internet. Some people harass us because we're different, others just make weird propositions. Ask if they can watch us sleep so they can see us change. - It's like a fetish to them. - Happens when you sleep. Yeah, which can still catch you off guard if you can believe it. What? Uh, us, you said, "Watch us sleep." There are more, others like you? Uh, well, yeah, you've never heard of us, of changelings? Well, that's what we call ourselves, the technical term is non-voluntary random interpersonal metamorphs, but we prefer changelings. We have a group, we meet on Tuesdays. I thought I was going crazy. I thought there was a conspiracy of women in green outerwear. But you lied. - You lied to me. - Um, okay. Ellie liked Nabokov and sushi, and Lois likes yoga and chess, different profiles, yes, but all excerpts from the same list that makes up the whole me. Mystique-chic, Heloise. That's the entire list, everything. And I just needed you to know all of me before I could tell you. Well, how could you possibly expect us to keep matching? Well, that wasn't always the plan. I was going to tell you on our second date but it didn't go the way that I expected it. Because I didn't sleep with you? No, because you didn't see me, and you didn't want what you did see. And why? What, was it because I was big or was it because I was brown? Uh... That isn't fair, Ellie. Heloise, fuck. I paid you every respect that night, - every courtesy. - You did, but it was different than the first time, you didn't see me the same way that you didn't see me this morning. Like I'm something distant and strange and unwanted. Well, maybe that's because I had just had my heart broken by a mysterious woman who vanished into the night. Is that what the fuck and fly by was the next time around? Revenge? You were Ellie and Lois, but you were Elise too, right? Jumped me at the door, got what you wanted and left, yeah, she was a fucking peach. I didn't even know I hurt you. I'm sorry, I can't read minds. I didn't see you. I didn't even fucking know you. What did you expect? More than this. Well, the disappointment is mutual. Where have you been, young man? I have been worried sick. I'm guessing it went well. I really don't want to talk about it right now. - Guys, it's like 10 a.m. - Yeah, it's beer brawn Sunday. So, uh, what's up, went well, huh? Yes. - And then no. - What happened? We talked all night and fell asleep. - For real? - Aw. Okay, well, then what happened? - I said I don't want to talk about it. - Oh, come on. - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Come on, just tell me. - What? No. - Come on, Pete! - We're friends! - I said I don't want to talk about it! What... Mia, goddamn it. - You wouldn't dare. - Tell me. I got that jacket thrifting with Mawmaw. Tell me. - Okay then. - Fine, fuck! She wakes up everyday in a different body. Okay? She was Ellie and all the girls since then. She's, uh... a changeling. - Well, I'll be damned. - I told you. - See? It makes so much sense. - I'm sorry, what? I'm just surprised I didn't, I didn't think about this like a week ago. - Honestly, me neither. - Is this some deep level of sarcasm I'm incapable of processing right now? Hey, you know, I actually hooked up with a changeling chick a few months ago. Like a week after they all came out, and she always wore this orange vest. So you guys know about this, this thing? - This thing? - Wow! - What? - Jesus, brother. What, it's a thing? What? You know, I thought it was going to be funny when you found out, but I had no idea that you were completely oblivious. I'm sorry, do you read? Changelings had this big coming out like four months ago. There were cover stories in The Times for like a month, where were you? There's like a changeling bar two minutes away from here. Leshy's. Leshy's is a changeling bar? Yes, oh, my God, the pasta is amazing. - I know! - There's a big issue of knowledge and sensitivity - training in public services right now. - How is this possible? I'm sorry, you live in a rent controlled apartment in Los Angeles, and you're asking me about what is possible? Okay, okay, whatever, we've had our fun, but honestly I think you should just drop this. - Jackson! - Look, changelings, they are fine to hang out with and everything, but they come with their complications. - You don't want to have to deal with that, dude. - Don't listen to him. Peter, look, you said you wanted something real, well, like it or not, this is real. - It's time to step up to the plate. - You do not get to say that. - Yeah, she did lie to him, Mia. - Yeah, she did. Well, hey, and you don't get to say that either. This isn't happening to you guys. No, no, it's not. It's happening to you. So, what do you feel, angry at her for hiding something she knew would make you run away, or scared that, maybe, ultimately it doesn't matter? That girl you fell for, she's still that person. And that person that you stayed up all night talking to, she's that person too. Maybe she deserves a straight shot? I, I have study group, I should go. Hey, man, um, I still just... I want to say, I think it's more trouble than it's worth but, uh, yeah, you're an adult, just do what you want, dude. Heloise? Hi. - I'm sorry. - Sorry? For lying. For not telling you the truth about me sooner. I'm sorry for freaking out. It was... it was a lot to take in. Do you have any questions? You must have questions. How does the hair work? - I'm sorry? - Your hair's shorter today, does it just, like, go back into your head? - I... - Exactly how many of you are there? More than you'd expect. We're all just taking it day by day. Every day? Yup. I, I actually have to head out soon for group. Group? Well, the changelings, changeling group? I'm sure we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. You don't have your license, right? Guess I'm driving. You're new. Well, how could you tell? No name tag. - I like your habit. - Thanks. Or... what? Sorry. It's not as bold as we're used to around here, but I like the cohesion of it. Your digs, man, the clothes, that's what we call them here, - 'cause we wear it everyday. - You don't have a habit? How do people recognize you from day-to-day? - They... - He's not a changeling. We met, at Tim bar at Leshy's. Oh, uh, yeah, nice to see you again. Well, let's get started, I can't say that I see a familiar face in here tonight. And isn't that just so comforting? Let's begin by meeting our new friend, this is Peter. Hi, Peter. And as always, let's begin by asking if there's anyone here that has anything to get off their chest? Uh, my parents want to go on a vacation. That's marvelous, Marcy, where to? They were thinking, um, a cruise to Mexico. - Oh. - But then... they realized I couldn't go. Uh, why? - Why is that? - She doesn't have a passport. - Oh. - They said maybe we could fly to New York, but I'd still need an ID. But you're under 18. Sometimes I look older, and there's no way to tell that it'll happen. - Right. - You could always drive. That's right, you could turn this into a road trip. - You think so? - Sounds like a great adventure to me, kiddo. Yeah, it sure does. - Who's next? - I'm having trouble with my neighbors. - What kind? - They think I'm running a cult with all the people in yellow shirts that answer my front door. I wouldn't say it sucks to be a changeling, sucks to be a changeling with narcolepsy. I finally found an apartment. Um, but I'm afraid my landlord's going to find out about me. I am so damn tired of looking in the mirror and not recognizing the person I see. My brother got stopped by the police yesterday, and I just kept praying to myself, please don't ask for my ID. I thought my supervisor would be more tolerant than others I've had, but now I'm back on unemployment. At least until I figure this out. My boyfriend left me, he said he couldn't find the energy to be attracted to me anymore. I guess some people just don't want a freak like me, but, uh, you know, it's, it's their loss, right? Sometimes I just try to sit down and list the positives. I can eat whatever I want, for instance, size is just part of the daily crap shoot. No bruises either. No birthmarks. No scars. Found that out the hard way. Some of you know this, but I used to have a problem. I scratch my face when I'm scared or nervous, and... sometimes I couldn't help thinking I just wanted something that was permanent in my life. A way to recognize myself. So... I just started scratching and scratching... and scratching... until I made something I thought would stay but... like I said, no scars. But I'm finding other things and people that are giving me consistency, and... I'm really thankful for that. Hey, Bob, great job tonight. All right, guys, I'll catch you all later. Did you have a nice introduction to our group? Yeah, it was definitely an experience. Hello, lovely. Great job tonight. Well, I'm off, stay strong, and I'll see you next week. It was a pleasure meeting you, Peter. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate - to give me a call. - Thank you. Hey. Hey there. Thanks for sticking it out tonight. Yeah. I'm still pretty overwhelmed to say the least, but I'm sorry, I know this is your life... I get it. - I just need some time to figure this out. - I understand. You know how to contact me. Okay, guys, as you know, I promised you a very special treat this week. Our reader will be sharing her own storybook with you. And it's very special, because it's never been read to anyone else. Okay, yes, Amy. - Who's our reader? - Her name is Heloise and she is a friend of mine. - Amy? - Is she your wife? No, she's not, now, I want... Yes, Amy. What does she look like? Well, uh, you will find out soon enough. Okay? One second. - Hey. - Hey there. - You find us okay? - Yeah. - You ready? - Yeah. Well, here she is, it's Heloise Korrigan. Now, this is the world premiere and it's just for you, - super big deal, are you excited? - Yeah! Hi, everyone, and thank you. So, here we are, "Green Lights" by Heloise Korrigan. - Yes? - Are you a boy or a girl? - Amy! - No, it's okay. Um, I'm a girl. But you look like a boy, - kind of. - Well, that may be true today, tomorrow may be a different story, but I believe I'm a girl, so I'm a girl. - Okay. - Is it okay if we start the story now? Yeah! There was once a little girl who loved to drive her race car. Then one day, at the end of a long stretch of road, she could see an even longer stretch of lights. Some were red, some were yellow and some were green. She found herself stopping and going, stopping and going, as she approached the lights of red and yellow, she knew it would turn red soon. Let's see, all green. Flickering like lightning bugs in the distance. Stopping and going... All right, we'll see you guys later. - Bye. - Bye, there you go, okay. - Bye, see you later. - Bye! Yeah, good one. - Bye! - You too. Yeah, all right, see you guys, have a good one. Thank you for this. Sure. - Of course. - Well, most people wouldn't have even called me back. I am not most people. And neither are you for that matter. Well, I mean, technically I am the most people. Okay. Are you doing anything right now? I just thought, would you maybe want to hang out? I live like right around the corner, I could make tea. We could talk. Yeah, yeah, I'd, I'd really like that. Great. - Grab my bag. - Oh, yeah, sorry. Shall we? Oh, hey, Mia. - Heloise, uh, this is... - Hi! Hi, hey, hi, I'm Mia. Very nice to meet you. Uh, nice to meet you too, I've heard a lot about you. And I you. I'm so sorry, um, I have... I just... I didn't know that Peter was going to have company, or else... Um, yeah, I'll just, uh, I will get out of your guys' way. Oh, it's totally okay. Yeah, Mia, stay and hang out. No, I'm sorry, I can't. I, uh, I have class at four so, I should... Okay, I'll see you guys later. I'll get out of your guys... I'll see you around. Yeah, well, can I get you something to drink? No, I'm all right. Mia, uh, looks like your Mawmaw. Does she lecture anymore? No, not for a few years. She has trouble standing for long periods of time, and, you know, keeping the same train of thought. It would be so great to meet her. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's fine. I think I would like that very much. She is more of a handful than Mia though. Oh, yeah? Well, um, I can be a bit of a handful too. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Um, several handfuls even. Oops. Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot my keys. I don't even know. I'm... Okay. Where you going? - Your apartment? - Sure. Hello, how's it going? Hey. Nice to meet you. You too. "Hey, Jackson, how are you?" "Well, I've, I've been better." "Oh, you want to talk about it?" "Aw, guys, that would really mean a lot to me." Oh, what the fuck? - What's wrong? - What are you doing? Peter. Peter, baby. Calm down. - What, Heloise? - I know, I think my cycle's off. What? Since when does this happen? It started when I was 14. How often? Usually once a month for a few days. Up to six or seven. This is your period. It does... Other things happen too. And you didn't think to fill me in on this one? Well, I was afraid you'd freak out, and obviously I was right. Well, that isn't fair. What happened to the honesty? Transparency is important in a normal relationship. Normal? Oh, come on, you know what I mean. Listen. I'm sorry. Why don't we put on some coffee and, and just talk... I can't. I can't. I can't do this right now. I just. I should leave. Maybe that's best. I'll call you in... I'll call you. Hello, no one is available to take your call, please leave a message after the tone. Hi there, it's Peter. I guess it makes sense you wouldn't have recorded a message. Anyway, I could really use some advice right now, please call or text me back as soon as you can. I'd really appreciate if we could meet up and talk. Oh, sorry I'm late. Life's slower when you take the bus everywhere. Oh, no. No problem, Leshy. - It's good to see you. - You as well. So... tell me what's on your mind. Right. Well, things have been going pretty well with... I'm sorry, uh, last time I saw you, you were, uh... Bearded. Right. And now you're... - not. - Yes, well, you, uh, you caught me at that time I'm afraid. So usually you're... Oh, most of the time, yes. Some of us are more like 60/40, even 50/50. - It can change over time. - 50/50, how do you even know what you are at that point? Well, it was always easy for me, but it's something we all have to face. Some people find something familiar in themselves. Some find it's not so important, the best thing we can do is surround ourselves with people who give us consistency. Now... what was it you wanted to talk about? But what is this demonstration trying to prove? Well, they got a lot of grievances, Richie. In some places they are not even allowed to use the public restrooms. At least 36 individual counties have already passed. It's open. I brought aspirin and chocolate. What are you doing? - Excuse me? - Are you doing anything now? Or later today? Maybe, why? I just realized there's something you never done before and... I want to teach you. I, uh... have a couple of ads to revise for some clients. Can you delay it? I already canceled a parent teacher conference. Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? Okay, so the most important thing is you're only going to use your right leg. Other than that, you want to keep your hands at ten and two. Okay. Are you sure this is the best day to do this? - Maybe we should wait. - That's ridiculous, - you have waited long enough, so come on. - But my friend Jade, when she said she tried to drive, she got pulled over, and since she didn't have ID she got arrested, and then they couldn't process her because there was this... They didn't have information or records. Hey, hey, hey. It'll be okay. We're just going around the block. Okay? So, uh, yeah, on the brake, and put the car in reverse. Just easy. Just, it's sensitive, just easy on the brake. Super. Oh. Is this, this no good for you, or? Yeah, I just think on days like today it's just a little, just a little harder to get wet. Oh. I think this body might be... post menopausal. Right, um. All right, do you want me to, uh, - you know, go down there, or? - No, no, no, no, we can do this. - Here. - Okay. - Here. - Yeah. Just. - Yeah? - Yeah. Just, uh, just go slow. Okay. Yeah, just, just like that. Okay. Yeah. - Oh, God, okay, careful, careful. - What? Shit. - Honey, you okay? - Uh, so. Yeah, yeah, uh. - Shit, what? - Ooh. Oh, sorry, I... I don't think it's going to work tonight. I'm so sorry. Um. That's okay. You're sure? Of course. We'll just, uh, we'll just try tomorrow night. Let's just get some sleep. Yeah? Sweetie. Jesus. What? I'm fine, I just didn't recognize myself. Ew. Gross. What? - Hi. - Hey! What? No, you don't. Okay, okay. Is this okay? Yeah, just... - What? - Just... just give me a second. Maybe I could just... Okay, I can't, I can't, fuck. - Just stop. - Okay. It's not easy. You know, I just can't flip a switch and make myself... Okay, Peter. Fuck. I get it. This isn't fair. No, no, it really isn't. There are now roughly 10,000 changelings and changeling advocates converging on the national mall. There are likely ten's of thousands more unable to travel due to identification. I wish I could be there with them. Is this really going to change anything? Their demands seem pretty reasonable. Proper documentation would be a start. Accurate birth certificates, social security cards, - bathrooms. - We spoke to Leshy Mamuna, the head of our local changeling advocacy coalition, for further comment on the movement. What the public at large does not realize is, that we've always been around you. We have a legacy and rich cultural tradition. We are the friendly faces you pass in the street, we are your neighbors, and we hope to be your friends. All we ask is for you to see the beauty and the familiarity we see in ourselves. Hard to argue with that. Well, you'd you be surprised. Guess now this is as good as time as any to introduce you to the folks. Just me. Hey. Peter. Hi, sweetheart. Oh. Muah. - Pete Pie. - It's so good to see you. - Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. - Hi, sweetie. Uh, did she make it yet? Yes, yes, finally, I mean, she's actually washing up. I mean, can I just tell you something? They just had a crazy time getting her here from the airport, you know, and that whole escort system, I mean, it just needs a complete overhaul. Anyway, I have four degrees, I think I can figure my way around a God damn airport. Oh. Who do we have here? Oh, how are you, darling? Oh! Oh. You still tending those young minds? Yeah, I'm trying to, Mawmaw. Uh, Heloise actually encourage me to apply for some PhD programs, so hopefully I will soon know how the young minds are shaped. Oh, you are not. - Where? - Bunch of small places, a couple big ones. UCLA, Berkeley, Minnesota, Harvard, - Yale. - Oh. That's my boy! Oh. Get that girl over here so I can thank her. Honey, you need some help with those dumplings, - I know you do. - No, no, actually, you know, Mom, please sit down. I mean, you never put celery in it, it's got to have parsley... Where's your girlfriend, bro? Working on it. Anything the matter, buddy? No, no problems, Dad. When's the little miss making her debut? She, uh... I think she's running a little behind getting ready. Uh-huh. sounds like somebody else I know. Oh, Richard, you shut the hell up. I was getting nervous about meeting your parents, so I tried to do some deep breathing exercises, some meditation, and I guess it worked pretty well because I fell asleep, and when I woke up... I ruined my dress. Well, uh... - that's okay. - My cycle ended three days ago, I shouldn't look like this. It's taking over more and more. Uh, maybe, maybe you can lay down for a bit, - we can see if... - I've been trying to lie down for the past hour, I even took a handful of melatonin. I still can't even sit still, okay. I don't know what's happening to me! Okay. Hey. It's going to be okay. Do you really want me to go out looking like this? We should never have agreed to this, this was a bad idea. No, these kind of things are bound to happen from time to time. Okay, we knew the risk going in. - I didn't mean... - I really don't think you do know, Peter. What are you saying? We're, we're in this together. Okay, let's fuck, right now. Like this. - Hope you don't want to travel. - We can go on road trips. And I guess we're going to be sitting at home a lot drinking, because good luck sneaking me into a bar. - We can go to Leshy's. - And, uh, oh, I won't be able to co-sign on a house or a car or get married. Heloise. What about kids? Yeah, I know you think about it all the time. It's hard to grow a fetus when your uterus disappears - every other day. - We can try, and maybe you'll stay a woman once... - you know, once your body... - It won't work. You don't know that. I really do, Peter. Look, this is what my life is like. I don't think you know what it means for it to be yours too. Okay. Well, I'll call my mom and we'll reschedule or something. Tell her I'm sorry. Heloise? I'm sorry. - Oh, baby, baby. - I'm sorry. Heloise, what did, what did, what did you do? I just wanted something that was mine. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Heloise? Heloise? Ells Bells? Look, I don't know, okay, she just left. But couldn't she be at the apartment right now? No, I told the neighbor to keep a lookout and she hasn't called. - Did you talk to the support group? - Leshy hasn't heard anything, okay, she left her phone, her clothes... you know, she could be lying dead on a slab in the morgue and I couldn't even identify her body. Pete, let's just be logical about this for one second. Now, nine times out of ten, people who run away like this usually go to someone they know. Does she have any family? Someone she might have fled to? ...Corner lot by Cleveland and Knox, my dad still prunes the roses out front. Hello. I hope this is the right place. It's the only corner house with roses on it, so. I realize anyone could have kept them up. How can I help you? I'm sorry, is this the home of the Korrigans? My name's Peter Shalen, uh, I've been seeing your daughter, Heloise. Didn't take photographs. Didn't want us to feel like we were... different. There wasn't really much of a point, you know. Yeah. You know, they really didn't know what the baby was going to be. The ultrasound said one thing, then another. I wonder if they were shifting in the womb, they must have been. Her mother... didn't know what to do with her, she wanted a girl so bad, she had expectations. Nobody really knew anything about changelings back then. She never let her go outside, she told people in the neighborhood that she had immunodeficiency disorder. Yeah, I guess it'd be a little suspicious having a bunch of different kids around. Well, you know, it wasn't always children, in her teens she started waking up sometimes older than her mother. And she used that to her advantage whenever she could. She started leaving the house, sometimes in secret, other times a little more brazenly. She, uh, she got caught drunk off her ass one day after she bought some vodka, because, you know, it's really easy when you look like a little old Vietnamese man. She got a tattoo when she was 16 and her mom freaked out, but it was gone by the next day. And so were the bruises. Like a year later, there was a fight. It started over something really trivial. You know, I'd forgotten what it was. But Selma, she couldn't stop. She said that she would beat her so bad the bruises would stay. Heloise was gone in the morning, she didn't say a word. Selma... it's not that she was a bad person or a bad mother, at times she... She just didn't know how to be a mother to Ellie. It was... so much work. That's no excuse for what she did. Maybe. I'm sorry, maybe? You weren't there, Ellie was... hard to handle. You know, it's... amazing. Ellie is so kind and warm and optimistic with what she did to her. Selma was a complicated woman. Well, Selma can go fuck herself. She was protecting her from the world. She was trying to protect herself. Don't give me that, that's bullshit. I know she blames herself. she must have processed it over and over, trying to rationalize why someone would do that to her. And that, to me, is just... the greatest evil. That someone could make a little girl feel so guilty... just for being. Make her feel like she isn't beautiful, but she is. Always. You just have to look at her. You can see it in the way she moves. You know, really look at her, and you can see it. Clear as day. Just like I see it now. I see you. I do. I see you, Heloise. Hey. Hey there. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. See? He found you after all. You two want some dinner? That is very kind of you, Mr. Korrigan, but I don't think we'll be able to stay for too long. We have dinner plans. - Oh, do you now? - Yeah, we canceled on someone recently, and... I think it's about time we make it up to them. Peter, are you sure about this? - Of course. - It's just... Peter. - And this must be... - Mom, Dad, this is Heloise. - It's nice to meet you. - It's, it's nice to meet you as, as well, I, I, I've heard... we've heard so much about you. Is that them? Is she here? Oh, you are here. I can't tell you how excited I am to meet you. The way this one talks about you, I'd swear you were a mythical creature. I guess I could say the same thing about you, Ma'am. Oh. My name's Mary Lou, but, uh, you can call me Mawmaw. Now, I hear you write and you illustrate children's books. You must tell me all about that. Hey. Hey there. Did I... did I rip my dress? I don't think so. - Does it feel tight? - Yeah. Then maybe you should take it off. I mean... it's okay. No, you don't... - You don't have to do this... - Shh. Are you sure about this? Absolutely. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh!
