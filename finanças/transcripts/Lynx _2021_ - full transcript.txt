It was when I was a kid that I learned that the lynx had returned to the Jura. This news was the stuff of dreams. I imagined myself tracking it, hiding and observing it. Just after arriving in these mountains, I started crossing its peaks and valleys in search of the feline. I've been tracking it now for years and I'm only just starting to understand the life of one of Europe's most discreet animals. Everything begins in the mating season. I've been following this male for a few days now, and he hasn't stop calling. In this season, people sat the Lynx is singing. The mating season is almost over and given the size of his territory, it's not certain he'll find his female. What an amazing encounter! Observing these generally solitary and ever discreet animals together for a few moments... Their territory is so vast that they may not see each other again for several months. Before the lynx returned, the forest had stopped renewing itself. Deer and chamois gathered in herds to feed on young shoots, which slowed the growth of trees. That's why foresters wanted the return of the feline: te reinstall the predator's essential role of controlling the number of herbivores. In the mountains where the lynx prowls, the forest has rediscovered its spirit. Even though it eats what it needs, seeing the lynx I know taking a life is a reminder that nature isn't a fairytale setting filled with adorable creatures. The struggle for life or death is present everywhere. In this early spring, the valley is resplendent. The herds of herbivores have dispersed and buds and shoots are growing vigorously. Wood grouse and hazel grouse, rodents and pygmy owls, all of this wildlife is taking full advantage. To observe it, it's my turn to blend in the undergrowth and become invisible in a game of hide and seek with these timid creatures. The lynx, of course, is the real expert of this game and I don't know when I'll next see him. Thicket of rosehip, hazel, beech and honeysuckle are impenetrable in spring. I'm having a hard time trying to locate the female and it's simply by chance that I finally come across her. On seeing her rounded belly, I realise she's not looking for food, but for a den to give birth in. As I haven't seen the lynx for a few days, I wait close to its prey. Every day, I expect one of them to appear. The chamois start whistling sending the alarm. The male isn't here by chance. He has come for the newborn. He is the decider in natural selection. The least attentive the least adaptive and the sick will be the first to be gobbled up. He knows his territory back to front. The habits of his prey, the ideal ambush spots, the places where they rest. He knows how to interpret whether a new scent is that of a prey or an intruder. In even more inaccessible among the terrain, among the rock faces I discover another predator. While the forest is the domain of the lynx, the sky is that of the peregrine falcon. This bird of prey almost disappeared too, but it's now protected and has returned to nest in the cliffs. I explore every valley and find myself at the foot of the tallest pine in the Jura. This tree, hundreds of years old, has a history. It has seen the destruction of the forest, its rebirth and the return of the first lynxes. And it's very close by that I make my greatest discovery. Although the lynx happily share the forest with humans, maternal instinct urges the mother to change dens if proximity becomes too risky. But the loggers are too focused on their felling to notice anything. Here, pines, spruces, maple and ashes are controlled and selected. The loggers apare the old dead trees which provide a habitat or food for fauna. They take only the finest trunks in modest numbers and leave an uneven forest top to enable life to prosper. This is known as "a managed forest". Although the humans have gone, danger still lurks. Like me, this vixen is on the lookout for the lynx. But for her, it's a matter of survival. Since the birth of her kittens, the mother can't wander too far from her den. This reduces her hunting territory. Both deer and chamois are used to her presence, making it more difficult to take them by surprise. But the mother is experienced. This is the first time I manage to see the mother with her kittens again since they left the den. At 2 months old, they are now able to follow her to discover new smells, new noises and new tastes. The mother is very attentive to the very independent female kitten which likes to explore the surrounds. As for the two males, all they can think of is playing. This is the father. I've never seen them all together. I wonder what role the male plays in protecting the young. I get to know the male better: his habits and his regular appearances. Now I get to see him once a month in strategic places. He patrols to check the boundaries of his territory. He knows its every detail. The trunks where he sharpens his nails, the bark where he rubs his cheeks, and the tree stumps where he marks his territory. I realize that this forest track which I had taken thousands of times marks an invisible boundary. A barrier of scents which the male keeps a close eye on. This is the one-eyed male, the neighbouring lynx. He regularly patrols this border, to check whether the area is still occupied. The scent is fresh. It would be dangerous to venture any further. Losing another eye would be fatal. But I know that the pressure is still on the father of the kittens. In the fall, I explore the wooded meadows. The damp humus fill the nostrils of the rutting male chamois. I haven't seen the lynx for 3 months, but I feel that these excitable males are distracted making them an easy target for the predator. The sudden nervous state of the chamois catches my attention. It's the male but he's not hunting today. It seems that yesterday, he already took advantage of a moment of inattentation by an over excited male chamois. Nothing will go to waste. It will take him several days to finish such a fine feast. Then he'll go to hunt elsewhere to make sure he's forgotten. The kittens have grown. The mother now leaves them more often to go out to hunt. Lynxes are primarily nocturnal and this is the whole part of their life that escapes me. At night, noises can be even more mysterious than the silence. This young male was only 5 months old. The poacher who shot him knew he was risking a huge fine to killing a protected species. Which is why he left him behind. In mid winter, the mother seems to be all the more attentive to her two kittens. As I follow them, I feel I get to know the character of each. At the risk of projecting human feelings towards them, it's hard not to see the female kitten as curious, the male is more fearful, and the mother is calm and caring. The male controls the lower part of his belly more regularly. After the one-eyed lynx, a new intruder is on the prowl. Such incidents seem to be increasing frequent these past few weeks. New territories are becoming rare. In the Jura, favorable habitat to lynx are remote and difficult to access. Natural passages to reach them are almost non-existent. The male must step up his efforts to guard his territory. My passion requires a huge moment of waiting and months of frustration. But by remaining attentive, nature often offer me some unexpected wonder. Deep into the winter, the lynx's territories are re-sketched. Mating season will soon come. The males will leave their domains to compete for a female. Over time, I've become fond of these lynxes and every time I see the male, I'm reassured that he managed to maintain his territory. What resilience to be able to live in such a harsh environment. Someone has raised the alarm. Eyes keep watch through the trunks and branches. From squirrel to jay, fox to deer, solidarity between species is shown when a predator is prowling. My quest for the lynx kas taken me far beyond of my childhood dream. Their's a different world to mine, but I discovered we have something in common: like strategy, diplomacy and alliance. This form of intelligence is difficult to to at first and only becomes clear after much walking, waiting and perseverance. The snow will soon melt and I won't be able to find their tracks. I'll have to look for other clues. It's the remains of this deer that helped me to relocate the mother. I just knew she'll come and fetch it. The kittens have grown a lot. Independence awaits them. I notice that the mother no longer lets them feed first. She's less patient, less tolerant with them. I sense a degree of timidity on their first outing. This is a crucial period for them. They're discovering new landscapes which they'll soon have to cross to become independent. But looking for a new habitat isn't easy in this sliced up land. Does the lynxes' territory cross our roads or is it our roads that cut through the lynxes' territory? The second male kitten was only seven months old. As the seasons come and go, I've learned to recognize each individual by their tracks, their voice, and their spots and their character. These past months, I've understood the fondess the mother has for her young. Not a slightest trace of the father for weeks. I wonder if he is still alive or if he's been ousted from his territority. The mother lingers around the marking points, as if she's detected a new scent. What an impressive call! I've never heard the mother catcall like that. I wonder if she already knows the male or if it's the first encounter? The curious kitten approaches like she wants to make contact. I don't get the situation at all. I still have a lot to learn about lynxes. Some scientist friends of mine also want to know about the life of the lynx. Early this evening, they found a prey in the female's territory. All around this dead deer, they laid cables which they hide under the snow and leaves. When the mother returns for her prey, she doesn't spot the trap set for her. Once she's put to sleep, and her health is checked, the biologist informed me that she will be released several hundred kilometers away. She will take part in founding a new population, just like her ancestors did in the Jura. In Western Europe, lynxes reproduces between themselves, what is risky for the species survival. Inbreeding is a different danger than road and rifle, but it's probably the worst of the three. I know the scientists are trying to remedy a difficult situation, but their relationship to the lynxes is very different to mine and I'm disconcerted to see the female I've been following for a whole year suddenly taken away. The young female is now on her own, just eight months old and I wonder whether she can survive in these two high mountains, two vast forests, and two deep valleys. I start looking for tracks again, but I can't find any trace of the young female. And then, at the end of winter, as if by surprise, she suddenly appears. She has survived. Now, she must find a forest. Her forest. But the masses are too broken up, and the valleys inhabited by species with no limits. Her search for territories forces her to cross dangerous zones. Now she has changed valleys, I've no idea where to look for her. I don't know her habits. By chance, as I approach some chamois, I briefly spot her. She still seems to be looking for territory. And it's not easy. She needs domain with prey and shelter and without the presence of another female. I begin looking for the young female in less frequented area. And that's how I happen to cross a rare spectacle. A newly hatched brood of hazel grouse. For eight months, I've seen neither hide nor hair of the young female. I wide my search closer to human dwellings. And then... She has changed a lot. She's lost her juvenile silhouette and turned into a magnificaent predator. She has found herself a territory brimming with deer. She's finally at home. Forced to move by neighboring lynxes, she has chosen a home bordering those of humans. And for the moment, it doesn't seem to bother her. I don't know if these hikers realize just how lucky they are to encounter an animal that's so difficult to observe. How wonderful it is to know that a predator roams our forests. So what if we hardly ever see it? It's presence gives hope that humans and nature can still find a way to coexist. These past few weeks, I found new tracks in the snow. A very discreet young male is criss-crossing the area. How frustrating! For several days, I've heard the male calling from an inaccessible valley and the female suddenly leaves in the direction of the calls without me unable to follow. Lynxes certainly live up to their nickname "ghosts of the forests". The mating season is almost over. I've never laid eyes on the male and haven't seen the female for more than a month. And then one April evening, here he finally is. The new pretender who's had me on a wild goose chase for weeks without ever spotting him. Youth is evident in his behaviour. But he's already has all the charisma of his species. It's strange seeing the young female with its male. She has succeeded where so many other lynx has sadly failed. I followed her for almost two years. And for the briefest of instance, I get the feeling that she knows. I never saw her father again. The last time I saw the female was one August evening. I think again of the handful of enthusiasts who made me dream as a kid. Those progressive thinkers who by releasing some lynxes managed to re-create a balance between predator and prey from which the entire forest benefits. A simple and natural solution which proves that it's never too late to mend the errors of our past. Without them, this story would never have been told.
