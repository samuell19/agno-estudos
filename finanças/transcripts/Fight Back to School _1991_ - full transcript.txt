Understand?! What are you doing? Don't know. Don't know? I've made it clear. Scatter, scatter. Help, help. You're smart, why are you so smart? Don't go too close. Hey. Dead? Yes, dead already. Sir. Sir. The mission has been completed smoothly. Star chow, where're your men? All dead!? We want a supervisor, we want team work. Not going alone like Rambo. The hostages have been rescued. Rescuing is just an item in this exam. What matters most is the safety of your juniors and your leadership but I can't see anything! Sir, give me a chance. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't! Sir, could you please reconsider? Who is it? Yes. Yes, sir. The boss wants to see you. Yes, sir. Good morning, sir, I'm star chow. Damn it, that adorable! Turn a round for me, don't be shy, come on! Irresistible, I'm sorry. Wanna get a promotion? I don't want to be a gigolo, sir. I asked if you want a promotion. I won't be gigolo, sir. That's nonsense! I asked if you want a promotion. Yes, but not at the cost of my chastity. Who wants your chastity? I want your youth. Youth and chastity are equally important to me. Fine, fine, I see. Let me finish my words. One day some students visited our police station. A pistol was lost afterwards. Sir, we lose pistols very often. But that pistol is mine! I can share your heartbreaking feeling. Yes, that pistol has followed me for 30 years. I've never shot it. It's for scratching itches. Speaking of the itch and here comes. Scratch me. - The back? - Yes. It's a kind pistol. Can pistol be kind? It's got a kind nature. If it falls in the hands of bad students, tragedies will follow. Don't worry, sir. I'll search the whole school for your pistol. If I can manage, I don't have to ask you. I'm retiring, but I've lost my pistol. I'll lose my face if others know. So I want you to enter that school as a spy. I'm not sure if I can teach. Who ask you to teach? To be a student! Student? I joined the police force because I hated studying. I can't be a student. Sir, if you do so... You're bringing me to a volcano with lots of wild animals and paying no attention to my wailing. And are just kicking me cruelly... Into the exploding volcano. How can you be so cruel? You can live and die excitingly then. Stop, no way escaping. Here's a pager watch, put it on. "666" means I call you. Say to me, "good morning, sir". Good... morning... sir. Very good. Don't let others know or both you and I'll be in trouble. I'll see if you guys will be late again. What are you staring at? You'll learn it by heart later. That's the fresh boy. Big stupid guy, from which class? Could it be ours? I don't think so. Star chow, I'm the head of discipline of this school. My name is lam. A mosquito. You transferred from england college? Students from that school are rubbish. I don't care what's between your family and the school committee. Edinburgh college is a prestigious school and teach the best students. I can't stand a single bad element or I'll kick you out of here, clear? Yes, sir! You think that's interesting? Bring him to the classroom. Come with me to the classroom. Around 1987, an observation from the sky above the south pole... Revealed that there's hole at the ozonosphere up above there. Strong ultraviolet ray is harmful to living organisms. A less serious situation will affect the genes. The worst case will kill the cells. Plants will die as a result. Ultraviolet ray can penetrate into the sea. I lose freedom, my heart's breaking my tears' flowing. I've lost my way and gone astray. My heart is breaking. Who's attacking the police? Attacking what? You! Take the duster out. I don't care you're new in here. What are you dreaming? What? Miss has got her pride. The lesson restarts! Let's start with the atmosphere layer. The atmosphere is made up of several layers. The layer nearest to the earth is called the troposphere. It's 15,000 to 50,000 feet above the earth. It contains cloud and weather systems. The ming dynasty particularly stressed on punishment. Disrespect party politics and espionage were subjects to punishment. Turtle wong. Mr. Cheng what does it mean by espionage? It's the current practice of spying. The people involved are called spies. These people are punished by castration. Castration!? Chopping sex organ, kid. Chopped by how many inches? That depends on how many inches you've got. The wrong book again, absent-minded! Really absent-minded! What's that noise? Thank you for your help. Come... quicker... Serve him right. You're laughing so happily you come out too. Come... What's your name? Star chow. And you? Turtle wong. What's your name? Star chow. What's yours? Turtle wong. What's your name? Star chow. Let's begin, star chow. We must remember each step. Forgetting one single step will be very dangerous. Sorry... the most important thing of this experiment is... Memory. If not, it'll... Will be very dangerous. Stop! Hey... get back down here hey, you, go away please, could you get down here first? What are you doing? Who are you? What's this to do with you? Excuse me and you get down. Why pulling me down here? You're standing on my belly. Don't go away, we're on the same boat, we share the same code. Code!? Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon. What's the code? Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon. - What's this? - The code! God! Everybody's abnormal here, excuse me. You can't climb out from here. You can't walk out from here. Ok, I'll use the front door. Not even with the front door. What's it? Nothing, this boy's gone mad suddenly. Yes, I've gone mad. I want home. What is it? Sorry, sir. Don't block my way, please. Excuse me, please. Excuse me, I want to go. Are you alright? I'm sick, I want to go home. Please let me go! Thank you. You're not feeling well. Yes. Come with me. Let's see if you've got a fever. No. Yes. No, look at it yourself. It's me who's got the fever, not the thermometer. I'm feeling so bad. Let me see your eyes. Look down. Look up. Look at the left. Hey, your eyeballs can't move? It can't move since I've got a fever. Are you pretending...? I'm miss ho, I'm not teaching your class, but I'm the counsellor of your class. You go back to classroom first. Come to me anytime if you've got problem. Be good. Are you mad just because I've dropped your pencil-case unintentionally? No, I ain't, ain't. I'm so frightened. So, how much do you want? That depends... Only $300. I'm not frightened now. If I know you still got money with you, I'll not throw your pencil case away, but you! I understood. Good, the saviour comes. Don't get it mistakenly, I'm not helping you guys, and I'm not your saviour. You can! You look so cheeky. They'll only bully you, not me. Thank you very much! Sir, I remember the code. It's dong tong, tong dong dong, right? - It's you? - Yes. You should have said earlier. I forgot the code earlier. Sir, I'm cid5798, I'm sent here to cooperate with you. Go home and have your hands stopped trembling. My hands are not trembling. It's Parkinson. I'm only pretending. That saves me from doing a lot of work. The boss has asked you to stay at my home. What kind of stick are you chewing? To give up smoking. Hey... miss ho? Forget about her! Her boyfriend is the head of anti-triad unit. What are you saying? What? I'm keeping an eye on that kid who's smoking. You mean Johnny? What is he? The head of the 4 tigers of beacon hill. His big brother, Teddy big, is really somebody. He's the most suspicious in the case which our boss lost his pistol. Keep an eye on him. Go! Big brother. You asshole, what a lousy idea. Big brother. Now somebody's after us for money. It's fine to traffic drugs, why trafficking arms? You said arms-trafficking is profiteering during the Gulf war. You should've persuaded me. What are we going to do with these ak47s? If we got pistols, we can Rob. Johnny is here. Why didn't you tell me earlier? He's cheeky. Even you can be cheeky if you've got money. You're here, come in. They're for feng-shui. Keep your hands off. I'm sorry. How are you getting on? You're cheeky now. Don't worry, my dad has gone traveling. He won't have come back even our cars reach shenzhen. Let's see and do pay us the money for the 2 cars of my brother back. I can only pay you when my clients pay me. You're not that in need of money, right? I need money badly. The money I collected in the school can't even afford 2 nights in the karaoke. I've got a great thing, wanna see? It's great. We stole from the police academy. Cop's pistol? 3 for each. Don't fight for it. In memory of your fathers? Do I still need to work if I've got so many fathers? They're all my ex-partners. Good, noodles... Cook some for yourself. Come on, no... Yes. Cook oneself is illegal? How many partners you've got? But there're 10 here. I have to prepare one to two more... One to two more... And see who's coming to me. Maybe he needs it. Just keep as stock. Would you mind? What are you saying? You don't understand? It's better if you don't understand. Die at an early age. Eat your noodles, I'll have supper outside. Remember to do your homework, you've to go to school on tomorrow. - Damn you. - No damning. Nothing. Keep talking. You're always so dirty. I get used to it. I worked as a servant in a school, it was fine at first. But I have to work under sir chow. What an ass. What are you doing? I'm less fortunate than you. I'm following the case of Teddy big. Arms? What a coincidence! We are also after Teddy big. But for the pistol. - Cop's pistol? - Yes. Really? They're in the machine gun business. Machine guns in hk? Yes, goods have arrived. Wow... Why don't you arrest them? The buyers are terrorists, boss wants to arrest all at one go. That's tough! It's life and death if something goes wrong. We can't afford to alarm them. Well, keep an eye for the pistol for me as well. - Sure! - Sure? You have my word. Among the gang of underground informers, all are dead except you and me. Of course, I'll keep an eye for you. Everyone can die, except this. Lousy. Brother Teddy, stay calm. We'll settle if there's any problem. Remember chicken brand whom you arrested 10 years ago. He wants to say hello to you inspector wong. Policeman. Understand? Yes, good. Understand? Damn you. Stand on one foot. A show over there. Watch only... What? I said watch only, don't laugh. Ha... Are you alright? Does it hurt? You just didn't take my words to the heart. This student is brainless, he's hopeless. Yes... always absent-minded, hopeless. He's a jerk already looks as if he's sick. Never seen a "star" like him. You two should be looking for the pistol not looking up the dictionary. He couldn't hand in his homework today and was punished by not allowing to go back the classroom. You can look into the case even if you're outside the classroom! If 1 fail to hand in homework again, I'm out of the school. Then I can't look into anything. Can you solve this calculation? Let's see. I know nothing about trigonometry. When you first asked me to handle this case, your attitude was different. No, he's always like this. I'm always like this. My soft words are for cheating you to get involved. What about asking some other policemen to come here... And solve the maths.. You're an idiot! That means disclosing the case to everybody? Let me tell you finish this case quickly, or I'll kick your brains out with my scissors legs. What? I'll fly over and kick you with legs like scissors and kick your brain out. Scissors legs, scared? Very... Scissors legs, what a joke. He was really powerful. He was! He was able to deal with 20 guys alone. Or only be able to shoot 20 planes!? Dad, are you alright? Dad. Dad, go to hell, dad. How can you say that! Damn it! I'm late. It's only 6 o'clock. I'm influenced by his hard-work, I've to do a little revision too. Yam... I'm not called yam. But you really look like. Have you finished your biology? Let me copy. I won't even if I have. Are you nuts? I'll give you $50 in return. Mine? You want money before finishing the homework? Stay away, one by one. As many as you want. Any compositions? Compositions. Keung, yours is torn, go away. - He's quite popular. - Yes. Copy this so late? You're ruining your future. Hopeless. Look, I've finished. You think you are smart? Of course. I'm not mocking you. I just want to say, from now on. I won't let anyone throwing dusters at me. I won't be punished by standing onto the corridor or standing on the playground, or holding a damn cardboard publicly, like a monkey. No! Just keep copying... Sudden test, those who fail will be standing on the playground for a week. - Mobile phone? - Cool, isn't it? What? What? Chinese history test? You two can handle it. What? Boss, my Chinese history won't do. Hold on! Mandy, ask all seniors to come up here. Ask them who was the one who suppressed the "an-shi rebellion"? Kwok chi-yee, b for boy, is that clear? Li kwang-bud, c: Li hark-yong. It's li hark-yong, not Lee hack-Ken. A is kwok chi-yee, b is Lee kwang-bud. Which two of them are the heroes? Kwok chi-yee and chu wen. It seems to be Lee kwang-bud and chu wen. So who's the hero? Answer me! Kwok chi-yee or chu wen? What? You look up the book? No, I can manage... few more seconds. Son, it's chu wen. Who's chu wen? The answer is b. Banana? B for banana. Ask them. What's the "ox-li party conflict"? Search book again? You even don't know this! What have you studied? Shit! Which big case are you in? No idea. A for apple, that's it. Next question, listen carefully. The answer is d, d for dog. D for, d for dog. B. Uncle tat, what are you doing here? Well... collecting rubbish. The female toilet is blocked, can you do with that? Come with me. What, the test is over. Sir, which case? "Three wolfs". Dead already? Reverse a previous judgment?! Stupid me, I should have guessed that. No. No again. You two are riding? Falling instead. So you two are cheating. No, only me who's cheating. Arrest me. Come out with me. A moment please. He cheated in the Chinese history test by using the Chinese literature book. You are dumb. That's not exactly cheating. I only want to let him have the proper punishment. What do you say? Deduct 3 marks from his conduct as usual. Stop it. Please don't. A deduction of 12 marks will let him out of this school. Miss leung, what about you? Kill him. What did you say? That isn't what you want? Just cheating. It's one of our experience of growing up. Who hasn't cheated before? But you even didn't use your brains to cheat. Stand properly. Don't move! You don't use your brains, you deserve it. I suggest arranging for another test. If he still doesn't learn from it, test him again and again. Until he passes. That's punishing me, I can't afford the time. - Save your time from going to the race-course. - Yes... I agree. You can talk to his parents and try to understand his family background. Fine, I've decided. He's punished by staying after school for a week and cleaning the playground for 2 weeks. Deduct 5 marks from his conduct, re-test on next week. Also, I want to meet your parents. Parents? I don't have any. I've got no relatives, no friends. Who's your guardian? I'm my own guardian. If there's anybody you want to see, it's me. His file. Who's his guardian? Uncle tat? Uncle tat! Stop it, god... big news. Uncle tat, is star chow really your son? You're a senior to me, you say. Star chow, say! Don't laugh, say! Yes. Yes... I'm sorry... I bet, they look exactly the same. What? The same? His dad? Nonsense. Hey, no... here... Your surname's tso, his is chow, why? How do I know? Why? This is an order. When he was born, I named him, star tso. But then he named himself, star chow. I don't know why. Is this correct? It's right. Sir, excuse us. Hold on, uncle tat, we want you to come up here to tell your son cheated in a test. Cheated? That's disgraceful, no good... You can't cheat, sir, cheating... Excuse us. Hey, don't you see, parents and teachers should cooperate to teach him. Right? How long can we teach him? Your son's been here for only 3 days and he cheated. - Give me one or two slaps and then go. - No... You should teach him effectively. Don't be too serious. Of course, not to be too serious. Alright, I know what to do. You cheated? I'll beat the hell out of you. Don't be too agitated... I'll beat you... - Dead already? - Dead already. - You're lying. - No. One more hit. You son-of... Sir chow, please. I have to use all my strength to beat a strong man like you. Well... I'm old and lacking of strength. After I beat you, my bones crack. - Really? - Yes. I'm sorry. Never mind, I'm in this business. Go and see the doctor, I'll pay for it. - Thank you, thank you. - Uncle tat! Star chow, do you know how great your father is? Don't mention it, all parents are great. He can't go on like this, let me be his tutor. I've got no money to pay you. We can't owe you this favour, miss. - Uncle tat! - Dad. I won't take any money. No... I'll lead him onto the right track. No... No... not good. So, let's start from tomorrow. Don't worry. Thank you, thank you. Thanks a lot. Save it, it's a golden opportunity for you. You said no to her, how dare you! Be smart, don't reveal your identity. Hey. Somebody's looking for you. Who? Go up and you'll know. Ok. Coming. I must show him how smart I'm. He's coming. Who helps him just stand on his side. You want protection fee, I pay it for him. You, turtle, must have no idea of death! Let me take your mouth as an ashtray. Take him here. Anything else? Nothing. So, don't call me up here unless necessary. Oki Hopeless! Star, you're powerful than Bruce Lee. Star, do you want to have your shoes cleaned? Smart star, have you got enough money? I can give you. What's more, if you're not neat and tidy, I must beat you. Your hand. Show me your hand. I'm too old to be hit on the palm. Show me. Don't, no need, miss. That one. I'll show you somewhere else to beat. If you are cruel enough, just use all your strength to beat me. Like a garbage can. It's shameful if miss ho sees this. Hey, what's this? A toaster? Throw the bread away. The blue magazines in your room you have to... Tidy up your room, stop eating. - What? - Let's play something. Ok, tidy this place. Pretend to have Parkinson! Is Parkinson your dad? Always, so fond of this. I don't care how old you're, I tell you. The son shouldn't have a larger room than his dad. Miss, I'm not sure about this. About what? Please be seated, star, your hair's been ruffled. Legs should be kept straight, run quicker, somersault. Yes... right... You haven't put on your spectacles. You guys look so bored. Bored? Let's ask miss to take us out for a picnic. Bring your girl-friends along. With girls, we're fine. Great, miss. Come on, help and light it. It can't be lit. Great... You're too young to smoke. Throw it away! I'll report to the police. You're ruining your future. Don't you smoke? No, too expensive for me. Don't believe me? Smell my mouth. Are you silly? Look, my teeth are clean. Well, aren't you too young to have wisdom teeth? How old are you? I'm... 18 years old. going on 19. But you look mature. Indeed, I'm ripe and ready to eat. All classmates have girl-friends, where's yours? I don't have any. I'm against dating during study. It's a waste of time. - You're cunning. - Right. - Really? - Really. I've seen your boy friend. He waits outside the school. How do you know he's my boy friend? I can tell. He's quite good to you. You're nosy but I think he's not my type. Right, you can't be reluctant to love somebody! He's a cop. I hate cops. Me too, I don't like them much. What? Annie, do me a favour. What? Can I see your breast? What? One side will do. Breast! You lose nothing! What a lousy turtle! You're dirty-mouthed. Stay there! Turtle wong does look like a turtle. Especially his head. With a shell, he looks exactly like a turtle. Turtle's result has dropped, I must give him some tutorials. But you're already my tutor. You still have time? You've progressed. So, let me be his tutor. I'm progressing. There should be no problem. Can you manage? Yes, as long as you're my tutor, I can then manage to be his tutor. You see? You see... See? This is my home, how's it? Grandma, pour some tea. Brother star, make yourself at home. Brother star, which TV game you want to play? PC or Nintendo? Not now... You're a nuisance. Pour some tea. Have some tea. Thanks, thanks. You guys are classmates? Yes. Study together? Yes. Classmates? Yes... You guys are classmates? Yes, how do you know? Stop it, you get back there. Stupid. Your Maria? My grandma. Grandma? Where're your parents? They seldom come here. Brother star, some great things for you. Wow... you've got a lot of great things. I'm coming here to be your tutor. Don't be silly. Grandma, try this. It's free. What's the harm of trying? Ok. Is it fun? Try backhand, it's some interesting. Try backhand and hit it at 90 degree. Hold, let the head go up first. Ready... go. Very good! Good hit. Try with both hands. It's much powerful. Hit his head. There, right... Wow... crueller than me. What about the open day? You're responsible for the games. The theme of the games is about fairy tales. Snow white and the seven dwarfs. What do you think... Snow white and the seven dwarfs are sleeping in the same bed. - Seven guys, they've... - Enough. You're going too far. Miss, these may not be something we like. Why don't you ask for our opinion? Yes... Just ask eleven. Eleven, what do you like to play? Video games. The same for me. Right. Should we find something... More interesting and exciting? What about popguns? Great... Popgun is too violent. It's quite violent but violence is better than porn. Have your supper... Thanks. Stupid boy, why don't you give a hand? What are you doing? Enough. How can you behave like that? Miss, have some soup. Have a piece of pork chop. Thanks. Uncle tat. Dad, you try some. - No need... - What about you? You got high score this time. Thank you miss for giving me tutorials. But turtle has higher score than you do. Really? Look. Thanks to me who gives him tutorials. I instruct him to study everyday. Isn't it great if every student behaves like you? Well, it's even greater if every miss looks like you. There you go again. Scissors. Stone. Paper. I even couldn't hold her hand. Damn me. Where's my kid gone? Grandma, I'm not coming home for dinner. See you. Mobile phone, cool. Brother turtle, for this month. Today is the beginning of the month? Yes, look after me. You should thank brother star. Be smart. Brother star hates dumb guys. A waste of time. Brother star loves this book, I treat this for next month. Brother turtle, this is to thank you. Smart boy! Something great to show you. Calling you, buddy. Why are you so thievish? Stay there. I can too. Brother star, you are silly to find means doing so. You son-of-a-bitch. Go away. Open your leg. Let me off, brother star. You keep running despite my shouting at you? I didn't mean it. What's your name? Turtle wong. Where do you live? Kowloon tong. The whole of kowloon tong? Next to ldeal hotel. Turn around. Hands on the head. Stop playing tricks. What's this? Your phone. I know. So, why did you ask? Mind your manner to cop. What are these? Hk dollars. I know. So, why did you ask? Am I not qualified to ask you? Am I not qualified? You're qualified... Tell me what are these? Hk dollars. I know. So, why did you ask? Son of a bitch, tell me. Or I'll kick your brains out with my scissors legs. Don't do that, brother star, the money is yours. What's that to do with me? Protection fee. What protection fee? I collect $30 from each classmate. We're the richest and most powerful gang. Most powerful gang? Right, the star gang. Big brother. Listen, I'm not your big brother. Take your money back. Go at once. He's calling me, not you. Call him, grandpa. Grandpa. Good boy. Let's not turn our place into anarchy or we both will be in trouble. I'm looking after you. Anybody gives troubles to you... Means giving trouble to me. Right? Right. Want to get up a branch in my sphere? We aren't seven-eleven. Such an idiot! Know nothing. He's silly and knows nothing. Let me see how powerful he is. Sir chow, Teddy big arrives. Seems to come here for you. Watch out. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Grandpa, come over here. Don't call me grandpa again, you guys. Brother star, Teddy big, is coming to see you. Who wants to see me? He said he wanted to see the head. That's you. That's you. You're the head recently. So what? Hey, kid, stop. Are you the big brother? How are you, brother? So, you're the head of the star gang, how cheeky. What did you say? You didn't even inform me when you set up a gang in my sphere. What's your rank? I'm second in my family, I've got an elder sister but she married a long time ago. She's trying to emigrate. How dare you talk to my big brother like that? Cops're coming. Kid, you're lucky. Watch your steps, you'll be less fortunate next time. What are you doing? Are you still the tutor of star chow? Yes, though his performance is not that great, do you know there's a new triad gang in your school? Triads again? I've told you before. I won't tell you my students' particulars. I'm not asking for that, I want to tell you. The new triad gang in your school is the star gang. The leader is your student, star chow. That's ridiculous, listen! He's my student, not a triad leader. But he's a bad element in the school. I say again, "no bad elements in my school”. We're responsible for leading students onto the right track. Fine, forget it. I don't want him to ruin our love. Can you stop being his tutor? I'm your boy-friend, I worry about you. I teach students to trust those around him and you ask me not to trust my students. Hi. Let's have our tutorial in the bedroom because dad's playing mah-jong and I don't want to disturb him. Are you alright, miss? Study in the bedroom. Alright. Having an affair? What? Have a walk outside. Walk to where? To Guangzhou if you like. One for you, one for me. You're wrong. I'm right, yours is super thin. - Really? - Really. I'm not the type you think and I'm not... Hold it, she's a good girl. Don't ruin her, 15 minutes will be enough. Go, stop bullshitting. Nuts. Damn! This is my home and you asked me to go out. Are you father of star chow? - Yes. - He said yes. Hey, what are you doing? It's only a gum. Chewing gum. Start the lesson. You think I'm an idiot? I'm disappointed in you. Help... help. Uncle tat. What's up? How are you? - Fine. - Uncle tat. Stand aside. Stop it, give me a chance. Who asked you to come? Teddy big, please give me another chance. Give you another chance to do what. To go away. Where you wanna go? I don't know. Go home and have a sleep. Your mom misses you. You're no wonder the no. 1 in the sdu. That's only basic skill. Cops can't be as stupid as you. You're right. Dad, are you alright? I'm fine, I'll rub some medicine oil... - Let me rub... - Good boy. Stop pretending. You're not a student and you're not his father. We are indeed father and son. Though I look younger than him, he's my true son. Actually, I can't tell you this but I don't want to lie to you. I'm a cop. Sir chow, everything's settled. Do tell all. I'm a cop and I'm in the school to look into a case, but I really want to help the kids. I don't care and don't wanna know what's between you, but please stop fooling me, sir chow. What are you doing? Don't tell the others, ok? Don't. Will she tell the others? She will, you go and kill her. Yes, sir! Save your dirty words. I should kill you first, save yourself! Ok... Have I talk too much? Do you believe I'll smash your head. I do. That's wonderful. Yes... You've been in the school for 2 months and you've found nothing. What have you done? Tell me. My way is like this. First I have to communicate with the students and teachers. Yes, building a relationship. No matter what. Find out that pistol within a month or both of you will be fired. I don't care, I was born to be cheap, I'm not ambitious. I'll send you to work along the border. Great... thanks a lot! Don't be so rash. You really scared us by your smash hands. Yes, we're scared. Please keep that smash hand away. We are scared enough. The students will do a good job in the open day. Great, last year was boring. Alright. Can you lend me your pager? - What's for? - Lend it to me. The pager is mine... Lend it to me. The pager is... I know, I'll return it to you afterwards thanks. If not for you, I wouldn't have scored 80 in geography. If not for you, the kids wouldn't have listened to me. For you told me, the goal of life shouldn't be for oneself. Now I can tell you, my goal in life is you. Sorry, for having lied to you in the past. Sorry, because I'll always follow you, star chow. Hi. Foolish! I'll keep the pager. Hey, the pager is mine. You block my way. Hey, the pager is mine. Why are you standing here? You're blocking my way by standing here. But the pager is mine... Can you excuse me? Somebody's chasing after you, run! Turtle, go away. Many against one? - Sir, shall we start? - Take a look first. Don't go. Damn! Brother star is in trouble. Help him. Let's start. Cops, run away, the cops. Brother star, are you alright? I'm fine, fine. Sir, the fighting is in full swing over there. What? Report to us in the police station. How are you? Are you alright? I think I'm fine. Take a rest. Are you two alright? Alright. Have you seen star chow? No. No, go back and take a rest. Have you seen star chow? No, miss. Talk everything to my lawyer. Turtle. Miss, it hurts! Have you seen star chow? No, I don't know where they've taken him. Have you seen sir wong? Sir wong... he... Hey. I'm not obliged to say anything. But whatever I say may be used as an evidence. I have the right to call my lawyer and to have some tea, but you've got no right to hang me up. - It stinks. - Hands off. Want to beat my sole? Treat me as a new comer? Good, come. Beat my head instead. Let's see who gets the trouble, come on. Right. I can beat you this time. Miss ho, you can't go inside. Hey. Are you alright? What are you doing? Beating your own man? Actually... Why are you here? Crazy! Beat one's your man. I've got something important to tell you. Let me finish. Actually he's a... Stop it. Star, are you alright? Ask if his hand is alright. Go back and rub some oil or your bones will crack. Are you leaving? They beat anybody no matter what. Go... It's fine now, go. You've made a mess instead of looking for the pistol. You will never get a promotion. Maybe you don't want promotion, too. Go away, get back to square one. - Give me one more chance. - Chance? I've given you chances. Still ask for more? Didn't I give you any chance? I didn't say that. We'll die together if you can't find the pistol. Real scissors legs!? No need to be that happy. Very funny. When is your birthday? December 22, a party for me? No, mine is January 4. Remember that my name is tso tat-wah. Giving a banquet? No, this time it's either you or me. There should be one who writes something on the gravestone for the other. Can you make it more explicit? The arms? I knew where Teddy big put his arms. Why didn't you say earlier? I'm scared, big brother. Call me sir. Attention. Yes, sir. Do you know the consequence of not telling the truth? Yes, sir. So why didn't you tell? - Afraid, sir. - I'm afraid too. But we're the cops and must do our best. Sorry, sir. Do you want to be an undercover forever? Yes. What? It's interesting. I'll accompany you when you die. Stand straight and look at me. Kiss you. Son of a bitch. It's this car park. - It's here. - Which car? - How do I know? - So? Look into every car. You're stupid. What? Some noise outside. Go out and have a look. Go in and have a look. Anything? Nothing. So what's the noise? Check around. Great. They're all long guns. This one is short. This's cop's pistol. Yes, this one... What are you doing? Bring them all to the police station. The car will carry them. Put them down. - Finished? - Finished. I haven't got into the car. I'm here... hey... I haven't got into the car. Excuse me, what problem? Everything's under control, don't worry, ok? Boss, time to pee... I'll show you something great afterwards. You call me this early, please show me something great. Of course, something great. Something great? Keep it. I've never thought it'd be back, smart boy. - Stop crying. More to come. - More? Wake up, hey. Wow... where did you find it? It's really great before my retirement. I can be the governor if I don't retire. Smart star chow, you've moved my arms? Want to hear your dad's voice? Kid. I'm fine so far, but... Listen, if you want to see your dad, meet me at the back of the school in half an hour. Remember, no tricks. Hey, the foreigner's getting impatient for waiting half day. I'm calling him. Be more patient. Ask him to shut up. He'll see the guns in half an hour. Why are you so nervous? The guns are with me. Call the sdu if necessary. They can manage. Then uncle tat will be more dangerous. Remember he's a cop and an undercover. He should know. He's old to suffer. Hey, I know what you wanna do, wanna show off again? Don't. I'd rather kill you myself than letting others kill you. Hey. This is a kind pistol. Don't. It hasn't been used for more than 30 years. Don't take it away. What you doing? Driving away? Drive if you have the guts. Don't come back if you have the guts. Young guys nowadays are so brave. Where are the guns? Release my dad. Follow me... Star, I haven't... Go ahead. What smell? Burn the banknotes... It can't be fired! Isn't it too kind? Go away! Catch him! Why coming back to school? Wanna let your classmates to be in danger? Today is a public holiday. Shit, nobody's there to help then. Higher. Hey... what are you playing? Stop... What? Popgun again? Give us a hand. Hold it, help me. You should help too. Hurry. What happened to brother star? He said he'd help us. He still hasn't showed up. Brother star must have been arrested by police. You're silly. Miss ho's seen him. Really? Miss ho! Is brother star alright? Alright. I'm right. Stop bullshitting. You look dull. Are you alright? I'm fine. So many people here. Why are you here? Today's holiday. Go away. It's dangerous. Go quickly. Uncle tat can run that fast. - Come closer. - Wait. Damn it. Have you seen star chow? - No. - Inside the maze. Why looking for him? None of your business! Stay away. Keep an eye on the students. Come here! That way. Hey... what do you want? None of your business. Don't make a sound. Babe, are you scared? Then you won't be scared. Finished. Miss leung, call the police. Hurry. Let's go and save brother star. Don't. They've got pistols. I've got one too. Don't go... - What are you doing? - Wanna die? Follow me. - Hey, wait. - Quick! You go first. That's the entrance, genius. How do I know? Every door looks the same. So you have to follow me. Stupid. Here we're. Call the boss right away. What about you? A lot of kids are there. I must go back. But the pistol can't work. I can manage. No, I must stay and help you. Seek helpers! You're too old to help. Hey... Have you seen him? No. You go that way. The rest follows me. Turn left. Keep on turn left, left. Hands up. Don't move. I've asked you not to move. Go... quickly. Kin's shot. Take him away. Quickly. Damn it. Go, wanna die? Go... that way... that way. Go... you kid. Squat! Squat down! That way, go. - Quicker. - I'll kill you with a shot. Move! No again? You didn't leave me one? You're cruel to me. - Brother star. - Brother star. Star chow, listen, the kids are in my hands. I'll give you 5 minutes. If you don't come out, I'll kill them all. Brother star, they mean it. Stop it... don't make sound. Stay calm. Do you hear me? What are you best at doing? We'll die this time. Damn you. Shut up! Listen. What are you best at doing? Flirting. What's besides flirting? Nothing. You're best at having fun. You flirt because you want to have fun too, not because you want to marry. Ok, let's have fun with them, and try to play a game but we can't lose this game, or somebody will die. Have you played such an exciting game? No. But we'll by no means lose. All we have to do is to cooperate. I'm the supervisor and you two listen to me. We are in a favourable situation. We'll sure win. Must be confident. Are you confident? - Yes... - Good! Start! Six of them. Give me any weapons. Popgun. Not popgun. I said no popguns. This is a real gun with 5 bullets. Only 5 bullets? Star chow, come out quickly. Let's bet. Mark the time. Good. Do as we planned, clear? Star chow, come out! You think I'm kidding? You hear me? I'll kill them one by one. 20 seconds left. Come out! Come out... or I'll kill them one by one. Come out or I'll blow their brains off. Do you believe me? So you don't believe me. Good. Run... quickly. Fire... fire if you have the guts. I'm afraid you don't have the guts. She's the first to die. Go ahead. That's none of my business. Wanna cover you? You'll be shot anyway. You know what will happen. Come. You think I'll be scared? I can kill you with only one shot. Fire... I'll. Go ahead. I count to 3 and let's fire together. 1,2,3... ok, sorry. It's my fault, sorry. You're no match for me. Why taking this so seriously? Guns down. Go back... Where's the money? Not with me. Where's the money? Here's the money. Put the pistol down! Do you dare? Or I'll burn all the banknotes and we'll all have troubles. Got a lighter? You don't have any? No, how about you? No. Brother Teddy, can I borrow your lighter? You asked for it! Big brother... watch out, go quickly. So cool! How dare you firing back at me? Come out at once! Wanna kill me? Come out... Don't fire! Guns down! Boss. Bingo! Kid, I'm not the leader of the star gang. I'm one of the royal hk police force also known as scissors legs. Remember that! Boss. You'll leave scars on my pistol if you throw it. I have no choice... your pistol can't work! I've told you this is a kind pistol. You want to use it to kill? How dare you? But you're so smart to shot him quite accurately, and maintain the police's reputation. School of police hasn't taught me this. I learnt it in this school. The men're coming. I'm leaving. Don't tell them I've been here. Thanks for arresting them. Chief inspector chow. - What? - Chief inspector? When I say you are, you are. Shouldn't I be the chief superintendent? Brother star. Do come and have tea some time. Pass this mobile to you, do call me. I'll come back right after it rings. - Take care. - Take care. Brother star, how lucky you are! Yes... What are you waiting for!?
