- It's weird, 'cause I talked to Central yesterday and nothing was wrong. - Well, honey, they called and they said the system was offline. We'll see. - Brian. Nothing's offline. Everything's fine. God, careful. - Sorry. Might have to hook these jumper cables to my bear skin too. You hurt? Don't do that. - Wait. If you want something really electrifying. You know what, I'm gonna put you on hold for a second, I got some animal activity over at Snowman's Pass. Yes. - Diana, I just wanna tell you how much I love you. - I love you too. - Come on. No. No, no, no. No one's watching. Cameras are off. - Later. Later, later, later. - Yes, sir, I'm back. - What is that? What are you doing? - Nothing. - No, show me. What have you got? Come on, what is it? - No! - Tell me, tell me, tell me! - Not here. Come with me. Well, I discovered this trail the last time I was up here. I think it's an old gold miner route. What do you think? - Wow. It's beautiful. - It is. So are you, Diana. I brought you here into the mountains that we both love because I thought it was the perfect place to... Diana, will you marry me? My god. Yes! Brian, it's beautiful. - She said yes! Woohoo! That's wild. Yeah. - What's that doing up there? That's weird. - Yeah, mysterious ladder. Maybe it leads to gold. I'm serious. This is Snowman's Pass. I mean, we've both heard the stories of lost and missing gold. What do you think? Race you to the top? What, are you afraid to get beat? - Ha! See you at the top. - Alright. Diana, be careful. Easy. - Yeah, maybe for you. So what's up there? - Gold! Piles of it! How many kids do you wanna have? I was thinking like three. Brian! - Diana! - Brian. Hold on. - You gotta let go of me or we're both gonna fall. - Okay, I got you, hold on. No, Brian, hold on! - I love you. I always will. - No! Brian! Brian, I'm gonna go get help. I love you, hang in there. Okay? - Yeah, well, don't blame me, okay? It's the budget cuts. I... Okay, I got a call coming in. I'm gonna call you back. Yes? - Yeah! Hi! It's Diana Pennington. I have a fallen, injured man at Snowman's Pass. - Alright, okay, slow down, slow down. - It's Brian. Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Got it, I'll send help right away. Okay. Yeah, it's Eugene at Central. Look, we got a situation at Snowman's Pass. - Brian! Helicopter's on its way, baby. Gonna be okay! Brian? Brian? Brian? Brian! Brian! Hey, Ed. - Diana. Haven't seen you in so long. How you keeping? - Good. Just keeping busy, fixing the house. - Still? Must be a castle in the woods by now. - Almost. - Hey, there's gonna be a dance on Friday night. You should go, get out there and shake your tailfeathers a bit. - Yeah, I know. I probably should do that. One of these days. - You can't keep living like a hermit, kiddo. It's not good for you. - I know. I appreciate the concern, Ed. Just not ready yet, you know? - Diana? Diana Pennington? - Yeah. - Diana Pennington the guide? - That's right! - Hey, Curt Seavers. I'd like to hire you. - Alright. Okay, well, what do you have in mind? Day hike, some rock climbing? - Something a little more ambitious. Snowman's Pass. - Right. Well, sorry, I can't help you with that. But Ed here, he's a guide. - Yeah, but they say you're the best. I don't hire second best. And that's no offense. - None taken. She's the best, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree. - I'll pay you top dollar. - That doesn't matter. I can't take you there. - Look. They say you've been there more than anybody else. They say that you know the place better than anybody else. - Mister, she said no. - You want to find him, don't you? I can find Brian. - Are you sick? Get out. Get out of my store! - I'm serious. I can find him. If you wanna talk, I'll be in the coffee shop. - My god. I'm sorry, Diana, he's totally out of line. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not seriously thinking about doing this. Diana, we had the best search teams looking for Brian and they never found him. Some stranger marches in here two years later and says he can? That's insane, why would you even consider this? - Because I never got to say goodbye. If there's even just the slightest chance. What do you know about Brian? I'm not staying. Tell me how you know about Brian. - I research the people I'm gonna hire very carefully. - So you would know that Brian's dead. - I also know that he's never been found, in spite of extensive searches by you, alone, again and again. You kept going back even though you knew there was no hope. I can find him for you. Coffee's the way you like it. Double cream, double sugar. - It's telling you how I drink my coffee? No, no. They did. You familiar with satellite mapping? Cameras and stationary orbital video? I've written a people finding computer program called Searchlamp. Look. That's you, 9:22 A.M., getting into your Jeep. - You're spying on me? - No, no, this is just a demonstration of what Searchlamp can do. - I don't understand. Why Brian? He's dead. Right, there's thousands of missing people out there you could be looking for. - If I can find Brian, it'll prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Searchlamp works. I need a remote location far away from prying eyes for the field test. I've been a victim of industrial sabotage before, I've had years of my work stolen. I even caught the guy who did it. Didn't have any proof, so legally there was nothing I could do. If I find Brian, Searchlamp may bring joy to people. And for you, it'll bring closure. I will find him. - Okay. I'll do it. - Good, thank you. - No, don't thank me. Listen. If this is some kind of hoax or some kind of wild goose chase, so help me God, I will leave you in the mountains and then you better pray that that little precious program of yours helps you find your way out. - Who's the model? That's Tyler. Supposed to be some hotshot climber but I think he's a nerd. His backpack's full of computer stuff. - And Mr. Security there guarding the President? - That's Hugo. Real charmer, that guy. He hasn't said a word to me yet. - What's with the earpiece? - I don't know. They all have them and they're constantly muttering into them. Whatever. I don't dress 'em, just guide 'em. - I don't like this. I don't like them. Why don't you take this? - Ed, I do this to keep away from those things. Besides, if I really need one, they all have one. - Come here. What are you doing? Have some respect! Diana, I'm sorry about the body bag. We're gonna need it. We'll take care of the recovery, okay? - Diana! Just take it, okay? Please? Just to make me feel better. - Okay. You worry about me too much. So that's where we're going? - Yep. - Great. - What? - Nothing. Just that's the first time I've seen you smile, that's all. - Hey, I need a minute to link up. - Tree, two o'clock. Squirrel acting very suspiciously. Hey, do I get one of those? Hey, sorry, Diana. These are very sensitive pieces of equipment. All you gotta is whisper into them. Why don't you go say hello to Searchlamp? This is the area we're in. And there's Snowman's Pass. That's us, or was us, 10 minutes ago. Can hardly see anything. - It's not a real time download. But with digital enhancement, I can read the license plate on this vehicle. - So, you guys all set then? - Yeah. - Head up this way. Everybody stay single file. Careful of the pine needles, they can be really slippery. - Any bears out here? - Yeah. If they saw you, Hugo, they'd run. Don't worry about bears. See how beautiful this is? You see things up here you can't believe. I saw the most beautiful shooting star one time. - Wait, you saw what? - A comet, a meteor, I don't even know what it was. But it just lit up the entire sky and I swear, it looked like it landed in the Pass. - When's that? - Two or three weeks ago. It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Guess that must have been the talk of the town, - No. I was the only one that saw it. You guys watch your step up here, it's a little narrow. A lot of falling rock. - Slow down, I've lost the link. Have to reconnect. - Alright, you gonna tell me more about this Searchlamp program? Come on, who am I gonna tell out here? - Alright, as long as we get a chance to rest, I'll tell you whatever you want to know. Basically it decodes satellite imagery to identify human mass and movement and even reads our specific body temperature. - Yeah, but Brian... - I know. Brian doesn't have any heat signature or body movement, but it also searches out artifacts, anomalies that are unique to humans like metal or clothing, unnatural colors. This door's unlocked? - Yeah, it's a weather station. And a warming hut and a first aid room, so it's always got to be unlocked. - Even with all that computer equipment? - Yeah, well, they're all bolted down. If anything goes offline, they get a warning signal at Central. And there's that. - This is monitored? By who? - Yeah, it's monitored by Central. There's just one guy, gets pretty busy. Hey! Hey, hey! Can you not do that? - He's very sensitive. Knows I don't want any of the competition to know where it is I'm gonna field test. - I'm gonna check in. Yeah, hi. Diana Pennington plus three guests, checking in at Snowman's Pass. Okay. Bye. Alright, tough guy. Let's go set up camp. Hugo, wave bye bye to the camera and shut the door on your way out. - And the reason we didn't helicopter in is? - Snowman's Pass is way too narrow. And the winds are way too unpredictable. Come on. A little hiking's not gonna kill you. Hey, how are those new fancy shoes holding up? - I haven't felt my feet for an hour. - Isn't this beautiful? The fresh air, the mountains? - I come up here all the time to just watch. - Watch? What do you watch? - Nothing. Everything. You know it's just this constant cycle of life. I find comfort in just realizing how tiny I really am up here, you know? All the troubles in my life are meaningless. - I can't believe you do this, after Brian. - I guess you wouldn't understand. - No, I think I do understand. I mean, I've never lost somebody that I've loved, but I did lose something that I'll never get back. And afterwards, I started climbing, higher and higher. I wanted to live in the sky above everything. But I always know I have to come back down to earth. - There's too much talking. I told you. - Alright, we're stopping here. - Thank you. Thank you. And I thank you. - Well, it isn't a rest stop. Let's get geared up. Tyler, I want to see you climb. - You want to see me climb? - Take that thing out of your ear. Just want you listening to me when we're up there. - I hear you're fast. Well, so am I. - Hugo, Curt, you'll belay us. - We're belaying? - Holding the ropes. You both take this, clip it in. Clip it on. Here you bring in the slack, this is where you brake. - Okay. Got it. - So you're not weightlifting, you know, not yanking us up the mountain. You're just pulling in the slack and braking. Okay? Got it? Yeah. Let's see what the best can do. - Guys? This is nothing for Diana. She could free solo this if she wanted to. That means no ropes, no harnesses, just a little bit of chalk and up she goes. - You're kidding me, that's crazy. - It's not crazy. It's the ultimate. Just you and nature. - But every time you gotta beat the mountain. One day, the mountain beats you. - How am I doing? - Not bad. - Not bad? - Alright, pretty good. - Just pretty good? - Alright, verging on really good. - Hey, you going over that? - No. - Wanna try it? - No, not today. Hey, too tight. Give me a little slack. Yeah. Sorry, first time! - You're doing fine. I can take you two up for a climb if you want. - No way. - Not a chance. - Hey, Tyler, what are you doing? - Just gonna have a look at it. - No, that's enough. Let's go down. - I think I can do this. - Tyler, I'm telling you, it's not a good idea. Tyler. Pull on the slack! Hang on. Hang on. - Diana, it's slipping. I think it's falling. - Alright, we're gonna climb down. Once we pass the protection, then you're gonna lower us. Hey. You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay, thanks to Diana. Diana, thank you. - You know what, when I say something to you, you have to listen to me. - But Diana, it wasn't even... - Guys! People die up here. You understand that? - Hey, about today, earlier? I'm sorry. That was really stupid of me. - Yeah. Just don't do it again, okay? - Deal. - How close are we to the pass? - An hour. - 52 minutes actually, according to our projected foot speed and the upcoming terrain. By the way, why do they call it Snowman's Pass? - What? You didn't look that up on the net? I'm shocked. - Tyler's not allowed on the net. That's part of his probation. The time was, Tyler was a master hacker. Before he got caught. - By us. Well, Snowman's Pass is named after an old gold miner. You've never heard this story? - No, let's hear it. - Okay. It's 1890 and three miners leave the gold fields in the dead of winter with a dozen mules and half a ton of gold, which is $30 an ounce then. Six months later, only one of the miners stumbles out of the woods. The Snowman. To survive, he ate all of the mules and his two comrades. So the Snowman goes back into the woods to get the gold but disappears. Neither he nor the gold is ever found. But legend says, the Snowman still guards his gold from beyond the grave. They say he gets you mad by whispering in your ear and making you see things. All to lure you away from the treasure. They say you can hear his voice in the wind but you have to listen really carefully. Listen. Listen. Listen. Suckers. - Put it away! - This trip's over. We go home in the morning. - Diana, come on. - No, he has a gun! My god, I can't believe this! It's a hike in the park and he has a gun. - Hugo responded the way a bodyguard is trained to respond. My life depends on his reflexes the same way that you depend on your instincts. - Not with a gun! - Tools of the trade. Look, give it to me. Give it! Look, got a problem with the gun? There, no gun. Diana, you gotta admit, you started this. - And for what it's worth, you scared the hell out of me even before the air horn or whatever it was. - It was a joke. God, obviously I shouldn't have done it. - Perhaps later we'll all laugh about it. Yeah, I can laugh. - Could have fooled me. Okay. Whatever. Just, none of this happened, okay? Good night. See you in the morning. - Diana? I'm sorry, were you on the phone? - No. Well, yeah, but I'm not getting a signal. - Neither can I. But I got one before we got here. I think we're in a dead zone. But if your phone call's that important, you don't have to go that far to get your signal back. - No, it's no big deal. - Okay. Look, I just want to say good night and I had no idea Hugo had the gun. Just so you know, that bothered me as well. - Okay. Thanks. Good night. - Good night. Hugo, go left 10 feet. No, no, no, no, no, other left! Other left! Your right. The hand you punch people with? Diana! Go back 10, 15 feet. - Back? - Yeah, 10, 15 feet. - In the creek? Okay. Thanks, that's all I need from you then. - Hey, why are we taking pictures here anyway? Or is that some big secret too? - No, this I can tell you. The computer's learning the terrain. It has to know what's indigenous, like the rocks and the trees, as to what's... - Unnatural? Like Brian? - Yeah. Sorry. - Don't apologize. I'm so sick of people telling me how sorry they are. Can I ask you a personal question? Yesterday, Curt said that you were on probation. - Yeah, they're pretty loose lipped about that. - I'm just wondering why they would hire you when they're so tight with their security. - They were impressed with my hacking, I was impressed they caught me. I wish it never happened. That's where Brian... I'm sorry. I know this is difficult, but we need to do this. Insert the data. Like what color clothing Brian was wearing at the time, if he had any metal objects on him. - It's been so long. He was wearing a green jacket, gray pants. - Finds her attractive. He's saying too much and getting too close. I don't like it. - Keep an eye on them. If it looks like he might jeopardize the mission, well, two can fall as easy as one. - Diana! Hold it steady! - Hey, you guys getting hungry? I'm just getting crankier by the minute. - Bingo. Have it locked. - What's going on? Where are you guys going? Guys? Guys? - Diana. - What? - We found him. - What? Here? - Down there. Hugo and Tyler are bringing him up right now. - We're like a mile from Snowman's Pass? How could he make it that far? - Well, we found this. Sorry. - I have to see him. - No. Trust me. Look, this is gonna take a while. Why don't you get back to camp? - No, no. No, I'm not leaving him. No, here. Take this. It's got a one mile radius. We'll be in constant contact. You don't want to see him now. Remember him the way he was. - Wait, where are you going? - Just going to say, I don't know, something. - You don't say anything. Leave her alone. - We can't just sit here and do nothing. - You want something to do, Tyler? Here, wash this. - Hey, go get the microphone from her, okay? Get her away from that body bag. - I'm so sorry. I never should have left you, you know? I'm sorry. - Here, I brought you some coffee. I apologize but... Life of the party? - Not much of a party, trust me. You okay? Wanna talk? - Yeah. You know what, closure is so overrated. Really, it's not as good as advertised. I want my money back. - I don't trust him. - Last time I came up here, I sat on the edge, watching my tears falling in the fog. Took off my ring, let it fall into the clouds, so soft and so gentle, so quiet and peaceful. So tired I just had nothing left. I thought why not? I already felt dead inside. Then I felt Brian's hand on my shoulder. I heard his voice. What I just can't let go of is that I left him. When I should have just stayed there by his side. - Diana, you went to get help. You did the right thing. - Yeah, I did the right thing. Why is he in there? You know, why is he there and not sitting beside me? No offense. I really appreciate how easy you tried to make this for me. Thank you. - No, don't thank me. My god! My god, he's alive! Get him out of there! - Have a talk with the kid. Tyler. I'm in the middle of work. Let's go. - Straighten things out? We've got a body bag with no body in it. How are we gonna explain that when we get back? - It's not your concern. - I think it is my concern. - Let's go for a walk, Tyler. - Alright, Hugo, you wanna beat me up, this is as good a place as any. - That all depends on you. - Listen, you lied to Diana and deceived her from the start. We all did, it was part of the plan. But I didn't... Come on, Tyler. What's the problem now? Look, I get it, alright? She's pretty and she's nice and she's had a sad past. Very soon you're gonna be a millionaire. Come back later, take her away from all of this, be the man Brian never was, whatever you want. - But... - But what? Look, until you're finished, you're either with her or with us. It's your choice. So choose now. - With you. I'll stick with the plan. - Atta boy. - Human activity. - Our boy Tyler here has a new attitude. You won't cause trouble, will you, Tyler? - I know my job and we probably just lost three hours of work. - You're the whiz, figure it out. - Hey, whatever. so fix it. Let's get some sleep. She's not in her tent! Hugo! Tyler. Diana. - What are you doing in my tent? What happened? - I don't know. Your tent's over there. - Are you going someplace, Diana? - No! Just stretching my legs. You're stretching them all the way back to town maybe without us, because it sort of looks like you're leaving? - No. I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do. Hugo! I wasn't sure till now, but now I am. - No, you're wrong. No, I'm being perfectly logical. - Nice to see you, Diana. - Now you're being foolish. Stop her. Grab her, get her! Knock her down! - It'd be easier if I had my gun. - Diana, honey. Look above you. You can't climb over that! - Hey, what's all the yelling about? Why is she up there? - She knows! She figured it out! - You guys were after something else the whole time. This was never about Brian. - Not, not really, no, sorry. - Well, what about the driver's license? How'd you fake that? - Ask Tyler. - Why me? - Because I needed a guide to get us here! That shooting star that you thought you saw, it was a spy satellite and it came down here in the middle of no place! Nobody could find it, but I did, I found it. - So what's in the bag? - Riches. Information that powers the world over would give millions to get their hands on it, hundreds of millions! Diana, come on down, let's talk. - Yeah, I'll talk. I'll talk to the police. - Yeah? You know, last night, when you weren't in your tent, I went in and I took this. Just for safekeeping. - Well, when I found out you lied to me, I got something for safekeeping too. Right out of Tyler's computer. No. No, no, no, no. - What is it? What's on the disc? - Everything! Searchlamp, the coordinates for the satellite. That falls in the wrong hands... - It is in the wrong hands! What did you do, leave it on the computer for her to find it? - I tried to shut it down but Hugo kept dragging me away. I told him. - Alright, alright, alright. You're the climber. Get your rope and gear and get up there and get her down. Well, look, either you get her down from there or we sit here and wait for her to fall down. one? Diana, will you listen to me? You're just making this worse for yourself, you know you are. Come on now, we're friends! - I can't catch her. - You will when she reaches that. She can't climb over that with her bare hands! Get up there, grab her, get her down! - Back off! I'll throw the disc off the cliff. - Diana, I'm sorry. They have backups. The only way for you to hurt them is to put it out over the net. - Diana! The black box from that spy satellite contains information that a dozen countries would give hundred of millions for. Our opening bid will be 100 million dollars, we'll cut you in. Come on down, let's talk! - Tyler, don't do this. You owe me. - Diana, come down and I'll protect you, okay? I promise I'll protect you from those guys. - You'll protect me from them? You're one of them! - I'm not. Remember when I told you I lost something I can't get back? Well, I lost my life. I lost my life to those two. I'm on probation with them. They caught me, they threatened me, they forced me to do this. And now I'm in so deep I can't get out. I never thought this would happen. - But you didn't want to. You know, Tyler? There's always a way out if you really want it. Come on, come with me! - Diana, what are you, crazy? - Get her! Grab her leg! - Let go. I can't hang on. - Diana, tie onto me. We'll go down together. Diana, you're getting tired, you have no choice! - No, I do. And so do you! - Alright, jump! - What the... Why the hell did you do that? - Because, Curt, you only gave me two choices! One, push her up and save her. Two, pull her down and kill her. And I'm not a murderer. Relax anyways, this bluff goes nowhere. She has to come down to get home. We wait till she's cold and hungry enough, she'll give up. - Are you sure about that, Tyler? You better be right. Hey. You better be right? Got that? Come on down. - Thanks. Now we're even. - Take Curt's deal. We'll make a lot of money out of this. - I don't want money! I wanted Brian. - Diana, what are you gonna do now? Where are you gonna go? My god. - Diana? Still there? - Tyler. Cut the and get back to camp. Diana! You want Tyler to live, better talk to me. I know you can hear me, Diana! Diana, throw down the disc or he goes over. Do it, Diana! Our disc for his life, throw it down now! - Give me my cell back first. - Sure, I do that and about an hour from now, police chopper shows up. You got three seconds to throw it down! One! Two! Help him, Diana, save him! - You're never gonna get away with this. - It's your last chance! It's another guy you care for who's gonna die! Three! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - You killed him. Not us. - He's not dead. - He's history, he'll never get out. It's her we gotta worry about. - Why? We've got the black box. We can be long gone by the time she gets home, if she ever does. - She saw us throw Tyler over the edge, she's got the Searchlamp disc. We got no choice. We gotta get her. We'll find her. Don't worry. Just take a little time. We can't order up a satellite like ordering a pizza. But she's up there, town's back that way, and here we are, right in the middle of Snowman's Pass. Blocking her way home. So you go on back up there, box her in. She's up there, watching us. I know she is, I can feel it. You, get up. Go on, I'll locate her. Go! Box her in! - Found her yet? - No, still getting delayed visuals from 10 minutes ago. But she's up there, hiding. Not moving. Waiting for us to leave. But when I get real time videos, she won't be able to hide. She'll be radiating heat and I'll be able to talk ya right to her. Hey, Hugo. - Hugo, how are you doing? Hugo? Can you hear me? Hugo! - Tyler! Tyler, can you hear me? Does it work? Can you call for help? Okay, I'm coming down! - Yes. Real time visuals. Hugo, I'll have her soon. Hugo? Can you hear me? - I'm here. I'm gonna get us out of here. Hello? It's not working. - Hugo. She's with Tyler. Hugo, where are you? Hugo! - Right here! - What happened? - I'll kill her, I swear I'll kill her. Where is she? - She's with Tyler! - What are you talking about? - She's got his mike, I heard them talking! Come on. - Thank god you're alive. Can you move your feet? No, no, no, lay down. Okay, it's really important that you lie still and not move, okay? Tyler. Just hang on, relax, lay back. I'll be back, okay? - Diana. Don't go. - Tyler, I'll come back for you, okay? I promise. - She's gone. Where is she? - I don't know. Back to town. - No, it's too far. The weather hut! That's where she's going. - Maybe. Who knows. - We gotta go there. Keep your headset on, stay in contact. She can't outrun Searchlamp. Power it up, power it up. Okay. I got her. She's heading to the waterfall, just ahead of you. Hurry. Cut her off. - Where is she now? - You better get moving fast. Battery's dying. Go on and catch up with her. Come on. Hugo, she's going up, she's going up! - I'll wait here. - Good! Yeah, she'll be. What? Hugo, computer's down. The last I saw, she was coming up the path towards you. - Okay. I don't see her. Where is she now? Where'd she go? Curt, Curt, do you hear me? - Hugo. She can hear us. She's got a headset, she's listening! Hugo, have you seen her? - No, Curt, not yet. - Yeah. She's waiting for night, she's going back the other way. With the computer down, we're blind. You stay here and I'll go back to camp. Alright. She can't come up the path, she can't go back down again. The only thing close to where she is is that weather station we were at. When she can't get there,. Here we are. She doesn't know it, but we know she's listening. So she won't be traveling as fast. We shake a leg, we can meet her over the waterfall when she gets to the cabin. - Thank god. Still hasn't come up this path. - Yeah, and she's not back here at the campsite either so I guess there's nothing more we can do except... just hide and wait. Damn, she could be miles away by now. - Why do I hear you so clearly? - It's got a one mile radius. - One mile. - She's signaling. There, come on. There she is! Come on, come on! Get her! Kick it in. We gotta get in there. Got that phone. We gotta get that thing offline. - Come on, answer. - There's a storm coming across the Atlantic I gotta issue a. It's gonna take all night. - We got you! - Come on. - I really gotta answer this, baby. Okay, don't talk to me like that, alright? You know what that does to me. - Eugene! - Don't have to tear it off, just have to... Nudge it offline. - Hello, this is Central, how can I help you? - Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Can anybody hear me? - Diana! You're on your own now. - This door won't keep us out for long. - Yeah? Well, I called the police and they're sending a chopper! Good try. I don't think anybody's gonna hear you cry for help. - Yeah? Well, it might be offline now, so they're gonna come and fix it. - To fix an unmanned weather station. - Maybe they'll come. If they do, some get around to it. - And by then, what will be left of you for them to find? - You gotta face it, Diana, you ain't got no option! - Come on, Diana. Make it easy on yourself. Just give up! - Got your Searchlamp disc. I swear to god if you don't leave right now, I will send it all over the net. - How you gonna send it, by carrier pigeon? No, that thing's offline! - Yeah? Well, see, when the dish fails, there's a landline that automatically links the computers to Central. See, I hit one button and this goes all over the world. - She's bluffing. There's no landline! - It's buried in the ground for environmental reasons! So the animals can't get to it! - Make sure, make sure. You know, Diana, there's a very simple solution to this. - Back off. Back off or I send it out! - Just give us the disc and we'll leave. What are you doing in there? - Making copies to every hard drive here. - Come on. If I had my gun, she'd be dead. - Okay. Diana, it's time. For us to talk. - I have nothing to say to you. - It must have been heartwrenching for you to leave Tyler up there to die. - Ed, Super Saver Groceries. - Yeah, Ed, it's Eugene over at Central. Look, I'm having a problem with the Snowman's Pass weather station. The microwave dish seems to be offline again, I'm not getting any signal. - Bolted that thing down myself. A tornado wouldn't budge it. - You really gonna leave another man alone on Snowman's Pass to die? - Shut up! - Poor Tyler. Think about it, alone, in pain, maybe thinking of you. Maybe calling your name. "Help me, Diana!" - Stop it! - It's okay to leave a helpless man up there to die. I understand. When you left Brian, you were only thinking of yourself. Run away, run away. Diana, are you running away again? Poor Tyler, he needs you. Just like Brian needed you when you deserted him. - No, I didn't desert him. - No? You left him up there to die. - Stop, shut up! Shut up. - Door's the only way in. - No it isn't, there's a skylight. - Don't answer it. - Could be some sort of prearranged thing, a signal. We don't answer, they'll send the cops. Go check it out. Hello? Is Diana there? - She can't come to the phone right now. - Who is this? Curt Seavers, who's this? - It's Ed from the grocery store. I'd really like to talk to Diana. Where is she? Well, she and Tyler both went rock climbing today. Both of 'em, high up! So high it makes me nervous just to look at 'em. I don't wanna yell up at her but if you think it's important, I will. - No, no. Well, how much longer you think she'll be? - Well, they both took the day packs with the food and the water. You know, I think they like each other. Maybe I shouldn't be saying anything but they shared a tent last night. Be camping near us now. - What? Well, kids? What are you gonna do? When I do see her, what's the message? - Could you tell her the weather station up there where she's at, the damn thing's gone offline. Something must have hit it, I guess. Anyway, if she wants to make a few extra bucks, she can fix it. Yeah, I'll tell her, but won't be today. - Well, whenever. If she can't do it, she's too busy with Tyler, I'll be up there sometime Saturday to check it out. - Okay, okay, nice talking... Ed, Ed, wait a second! This weather station that you're talking about, doesn't it have any buried landlines or something like that as an emergency backup? - Are you kidding me? It's in the middle of nowhere. The dish carries all the information in and out. - Is that right? Alright, good talking to you, Ed. See you later. Diana! Guess what your guy at the grocery store just told me? Yes, yes, hello, hi. - It's Ed again. About Diana and Tyler. - Hey, it was bound to happen. Tyler's a good looking young guy, Diana got lonely. - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But why do you have her phone? - Because she must have just forgotten it here. - Forgotten it? I gave it to her... - I think you're breaking up. I think I'm losing you. Kick it in! Diana, I just talked to Ed on your cell phone and nobody's coming to rescue you. It's going. - Look, we're reasonable men. We don't wanna kill you! Unless we have to. - This is for Tyler! How you doing? - Cold. My arm's killing me. Where's Curt and Hugo? - I killed 'em. This might hurt a bit but I gotta splint your leg so I can walk you outta here. - Can't. - I have to. If we don't get out of here by nightfall, we're never gonna make it. It'll be tough hauling you out of here. - What, you saying I'm fat? - Keep that sense of humor. We're gonna need it. God. I really killed them. - They were gonna kill you. - Okay. Tyler, I'm just gonna go up on the roof and see if I can fix the dish so we can get some help. - Diana, wait. You saved my life. Thank you. - Thank me later. - Diana! I knew it, I knew it! I saw you running away with that first aid kit, I knew you'd go to him! Backtracked you all the way here with Searchlamp. Those copies that you said you made, all gone. I fried the hard drives. But you got my disc and I want it! - If you kill me, Curt, you're never gonna make it out of here alive. - Don't worry about me! I'll get back if I have to crawl. Give me the disc. - I will, once we're back in town, I'll give you the disc. - You're in no position to bargain! - Neither are you, Curt. You're not gonna make it back to the car by dark. The only way you're getting out of here is by calling search and rescue and getting a helicopter. - As if! - Look, okay. I give you the disc and you leave me alone. Deal? - You see? Toss down the disc. No. You leave, I come down off this roof, and I leave it for you. Deal? - Are you nuts? You think I trust you after what you did to Hugo? I want that disc! Diana, Diana, can you hear me? - Yeah! I'm over here! Ed. - Diana, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's so good to see you. Tyler is hurt pretty bad. We need to call search and rescue. - I already did, they're on their way. - How did you know we'd be here? Well, I grabbed my ATV and double timed it up here. What the hell happened to him? - Me. He's a bad man. So how'd you know to come up here? - What do you mean, how did I know? - I mean, how'd you know we'd be here? - Diana, the man who was calling? - What man? - Come on, you must have heard him. Where is he? He was yelling from your direction, telling me to get my butt in gear and come over and help you. - No, there's nobody else up here. Sometimes the only way to face your own demons is to meet a real one face to face. Curt Seavers was that demon. I'd not let myself feel from the loss of Brian. I too has stopped living. I'll never know what happened to him, but at least his final resting place is where he'd want it, in the mountains that he and I love. Brian. I can get on with my life now. In some strange way, I have Curt Seavers to thank for that.
