Good morning, students. I am Professor Alexander Keating, welcome to my class, Marriage Counseling 401 or, as I would like to call it, How To Get Away With Cheating. Who can tell me what the biggest myth about cheating is? Ah here, Sebastian, go ahead. It's bad for you. Cheating is good for you. Cheating is not bad for you, cheating is good. Somebody say, "Cheating is good." Cheating is good. Cheating is good. Cheating is good. Mm, that's right, cheating, cheating you see, it gives you the chance to understand all of the things you don't want in relationships so you can appreciate the things that you do have. There's a saying in baseball, If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying and relationships are the same way. Relationships are the same way and sometimes, like baseball, the relationship can just get a little bit boring and that's when you gotta get out there and do what you have to do and run around them bases, run around them bases until you can score and your marriage is safe! ♫ Yo why you keep on making faces ♫ Your boyfriend tripping, you just send me your location ♫ See, I had a chance to stay home ♫ But you never use my phone ♫ So just hit me while I'm gone, when I'm gone ♫ Yeah, late night, Netflix and chill ♫ She think I'm playing, but I'm really coming over for real ♫ I ain't on a date so let's make this clear ♫ Don't get offended when I'm biting your ear, that's right ♫ She only got a problem with a man like, man like ♫ She need a fixer from the fixer ♫ I can handle you all night, all night ♫ I got the sex he wouldn't give ya, give ya ♫ So I put it down and made it up, made it up ♫ I'm the man, watch me eat it up, eat it up ♫ You say he coming home late, I'm on my way ♫ Set the stage straight ♫ What we do is between me and you ♫ Act like you never knew, girl ♫ 'Cause tonight I'm headed your way ♫ Send your package and show me where you stay, girl ♫ I took a ride on the West Side, West Side ♫ Knock your door, you let me inside ♫ Guess I'm gonna get a better ride, better ride ♫ Sure you're living like, like a scandal ♫ I think you need to twist the scandal ♫ Sure gimme girl, up in the scandal ♫ She probably been watching scandal, watching scandal Well he always criticizes me. I feel like whenever we're out somewhere or if I'm in the car, he always has to criticize me about how I'm driving or what I'm doing or everything has to be a certain way. You know, it really, really aggravates me. It has to be done his way. It can't be my way. I feel really uncomfortable and I feel like I can't be myself and it really irritates me that, you know, I'm trying to be myself, I'm trying to be comfortable around you and I can't because it always has to be done your way and I just don't feel like you respect how I feel or how I like to do things and I don't feel like anything I do is right. I just feel like you're always criticizing me. Mr. Fulmer, what did you hear your wife just say? Probably nothing. Was she speaking? How did it make you feel to hear what your wife just said? It made me feel like she doesn't listen to anything I say. It was great to see you guys, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, thank you. Hello? Gary, I'm so sorry. Just Just please talk to me. Listen, I promise I am not as crazy as you think that I am. I'm not psycho. Gary, hello? I just need you to trust me, I love you. You dumb son of a bitch! Oh you're just lucky. If I was there, I promise you, I would stab you in your eye with a pencil! You damn son of a bitch! Okay. What is wrong with these people?! Okay. Okay, these bastards. Oh my Oh my God, are you okay? Oh, my fibula. Oh, oh, I think so. What the hell are you doing diving in front of my car like that? - Oh God. - Do you have a death wish? No, no, no, no... Obviously, you must have a death wish. Oh my gosh, are you blind? Did you not see me backing up my car? I was dying to meet you, girl, so. You literally almost died to meet me. I said I was dying, yeah. How you doing? Hi. My name is Alex. Hi Alex, I'm Fabrae. Oh, Fabrae, oh that's nice, that's foreign, that's foreign, I like that. Nice to meet you, though. Nice to meet you. Are you a professor here? Oh yes, indubitably. Player, player. Well, I'm glad to know you're okay. Oh yeah girl, I'm okay. You just gonna touch my chest like that and walk away, girl? You better check my heartbeat or something. It's beating for you right now. ♫ Baby girl you know I want you to know ♫ The things I wanna do to you, time to let it show ♫ No messing around, but it is no mo' Jared, look, bottom line is that Bo is the most qualified candidate for the job. He doesn't need experience. Look, the man knows air conditioning and refrigeration. On top of that, he's reliable, he's self-sufficient and he looks good. Nah, he can start whenever you need him to start. So what's the salary looking like with this? No, no, no, that's not acceptable. He's gonna need double that. Mmhmm. He'll be there Monday. What just happened? You got the job. What job, I didn't apply for a job. I applied for you. You applied for a job for me? Yeah. Why are you so amazing? 'Cause I'm meant for you, duh. Quinn, you like the best thing that ever happened to me. Is that right? I swear. Tell me you love me. I love you. I wanna marry you, baby. You gonna marry me? Have babies, we should put some babies in here. Okay, but you're gonna have to do more than that, you have to show me. What you want me to do? I wanna see everything. What was that? Everything. Oh, hold up a second. Are you serious? Ah, I gotta go. What? Where? My mom got hit by a car. I thought your momma was in Denver. I'm so scared of heights. You say what? Huh? You said you're scared of heights. I am, but I have you here to protect me, right? You better believe it. So I heard that a woman knows whether or not she wants to sleep with a man within moments after meeting him. Is that true? Mm, yes. What about men, do they know? How bad do you wanna sleep with me right now, Professor Keating? Well seeing that I almost killed myself trying to meet you, I'd say pretty bad. I'd say desperately. Me too, so desperate. I'm glad you're so desperate, like I am. Not so fast. I have a question to ask you. That's kind of rough, but okay... Are you married? Like Will and Jada married... Like married, married. Does it matter? Not to some, but to me, marriage is a deal breaker. Not only will I not sleep with a married man, but I will ruin a married man's life if I find out he's married and he didn't tell me. So Professor Keating... - Yes? - Sweetheart... - Yes? - Baby... Yeah baby, yeah, what's up? Are you married? I love my husband but... You think he's cheating on you. You should follow his ass. Follow him where? Everywhere. What is that gonna accomplish? I don't know yet, but I got this friend named Juicy and she suggested that I just follow Bo around one day just to see what he's up to. So I did. You have a friend named Juicy? Oh yeah Olivia, you would love her. She's like this ride or die intellectual hood chick. So anyways, I follow Bo to a coffee shop, he sits down, has a cup of coffee and then leaves and goes to the gym. So you followed him for nothing. While I was at the coffee shop, this little Hispanic chica walks in, right? Sits down directly across from him. They don't touch, they don't speak, they barely even made eye contact, but I knew that they knew each other. How? Because Bo has a type, cute face, a big breast girl. That's him all day. So you mean to tell me, this cute Hispanic chica walks in, cute face, big breasts and Bo doesn't even look at her? So after he left and went to the gym, I followed her and ran her plates. Quinn, how you run her plates? Girl, I got a homegirl that's a cop, okay? Anyways, Bo's little side piece name is Raquel Ramirez, but they call her RaRa. I know where she works, I know where she lives and I'ma follow her again tomorrow. In hopes of finding what? The truth! I'ma follow her, I'ma follow him, I'ma follow whoever I need to follow until I stop feeling the way that I been feeling and I've been feeling lately like my man is cheating on me just like you feel that your man is cheating on you. The only difference is, is that, I'm not gonna let him get away with it. Amazing, yeah girl. ♫ Lately I've been thinking ♫ Oh baby, you crazy ♫ Tonight girl I don't wanna fight ♫ I'll make you scream my name What's your name? Wes Lee. - Wesley... - No, it's Wes Lee. My name is Laurel, Wes Lee. Do you like to have fun? We could. A few of us graduate students are gonna take out Professor Keating. Would you like to come? I would love to come. Hey Laurel, who are those two in the back? That's Frank and Bonnie, they're glorified kiss asses. They work for Professor Keating. Doing what? Bonnie, the blond, that's his agent and Frank, the stone face, he's his manager. So besides the butt sweat on their lips, they're actually pretty cool. What does professor Keating need with an agent? Because Professor Keating is one of the most sought after public speakers in the United States. Good morning and welcome to Marriage Counseling 401. I am Professor Alexander Keating. I'm sure that many of you have heard a lot of good things about me, but more importantly, I can tell by the excitable looks on your faces that you've heard a lot of good things about this class. That's the reason why you're here. So, let's go ahead and get into it. Take a shower. Okay, when you come home from having whatever random sexual activity that you've encountered, she's gonna wanna get close to you. You think it's love, it's not. She wants to smell you. Nobody knows your smell better than your woman. Take a shower. Wash the smell of someone else off of your body. No matter what she says or how dire the emergency, take that shower or you will lose her forever. Hey babe, where you at? I'm right here. You going somewhere? Yeah, I told you I have that overnight counseling session in Yonks, remember? - Oh, okay... - I told you about that. Hey, when you leave, when you leave? Now. Okay, well I'm gonna go take a shower and then I'll drive you. Oh, I called an Uber, it's okay. Okay, well I guess I'll see you next week. I'll see you when you get back. So I can't have a kiss before I leave, nothing? Babe, I smell like some musty special ed teacher and some kids. I'm just musty as crazy right now, booty stank. I'ma get at, just I love you. Here is the plan everyone. So Professor Keating doesn't necessarily know that we are coming, so this is a bit of a surprise. So we have to be very, very quiet when we go into his house, okay? I gotta go. You gotta what? I'm going. No, no, stay right here. You don't need to go nowhere. - Be right back. - No. - Come with me. - No. I'm not going nowhere, I'ma chill right here. I'm not moving. - Okay... - No. I'll be back. Wait, so they more important? I'll be right back. You are something else. Hey. What's happening? He's nice, right? Look, stop hating. You're still my number one guy. I think there's a cover charge there. Professor Keating, we're here to save you, mm, from your loneliness. What are you, dumb? You're all dumb. Keep your voices down. Shh, I think he's with someone. Fabrae. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, get up, get up, get up. Get up, come on, come on, come on, Fabrae. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, we got some more strokes to do, come on. Fabrae, Fabrae, Fabrae, come on, girl. Fabrae, Fabrae, hey, hey, hey. ♫ Baby what you doing ♫ I've got everything you need and more ♫ So turn the lights down ♫ So baby, come here, get comfortable What you thinking? I know what you was thinking, pretty face, small waist, big bootie, that's what you was thinking. ♫ Like a blackened mile that you can smoke ♫ Body is a flame girl, don't you choke Rule number three, rule number three, give yourself enough time 'cause you're gonna need to make your next lie your best lie. Okay, I need more time, I need more time. ♫ Never saw my lips, we're bumping and grinding ♫ Yeah, yeah ♫ Oh you got me turning down every girl that comes around ♫ You've got me turning down every girl that comes around ♫ You know that we're love, you know that we're love ♫ You know that we're love, oh, oh ♫ Girl we high as a plane, I'm your pilot today ♫ Today gonna take you wherever you like ♫ 'Cause I don't wanna take my chance without the women We have got to get out of here. I agree. We can't leave until we get the woman out of the office. Oh, who do you think she is? I don't know, but we gotta get her out of here. Makaela, grab her legs. I'm not touching that woman. Shh, everyone, we need to stay calm and we need to be quiet, okay? Look, that woman could be dead for all we know. We can't do that. What happened to her? Oh, Professor Keating sexed her into a coma. Dude, where the hell have you been? And why are you holding up a pair of panties, man? What? Were you masturbating up there? No. Why'd you go upstairs? Just to check things out. Look forget all that. Ash, get her out of here, man, grab her legs. All right, all right. Fuck. No Steven, we need to find her address and take her home right now. Just, everyone needs to calm down. What the fuck, she needs to go to a fucking doctor. We don't know that. Are you serious? She's unconscious, of course she needs to go to a doctor. And how the hell are we supposed to explain all that, huh? Everyone stop! We are going to drop her off on the side of the road. What? What the, God! What the fuck is wrong with you? That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. You just wanna drop her off on the side of the road? Why the hell would you hit the driver? At least we know she's alive. Oh sh... Come on, open the door, fucking come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! Oh my God. - Go, go. - Unlock the door! - Get out of the car! - No, no. Open this motherfucker, man. - Go, right now. - Jesus! Come on, let's go, get the fuck out of the car! Come on, let's go. What the fuck, oh my God. Leave her there, come on. Just leave her. Frank, come on. Hurry the fuck up before somebody sees us. Let's get outta here, let's go! Wait, wait, I need a selfie! Jesus. Let's get outta here, let's go! Oh shit. What, what what what? Alex is here, come on, go go go, Alex is home. I love you Alex. Look, I know I'm not supposed to say that, but I truly believe if you feel something for someone, you should just go ahead and let them know because you just never know if you'll ever have the chance to tell them again. Every time I try to love, I get treated like this. Every time. I don't understand. I don't understand what is so bad about me that makes it so easy to just walk away. Now I guess I'm just someone you can cast away and literally have placed on the side of the road like yesterday's garbage. Daddy? Daddy why am I not good enough? How could you just walk away and leave me? How could you daddy, how could you just leave me like this? I love you, daddy, I love you. Why am I not good enough? ♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫ Oh, oh, oh ♫ I never meant to hurt you ♫ Days I didn't deserve you ♫ Sometimes I feel your flesh ♫ Is my heart still working ♫ Days are starting to get colder ♫ Come really looking over my shoulders ♫ Hoping that you're still there Oh my God, it's you. Hey! Hi, oh my gosh, so this is you. Oh my God, so I've through so many failed relationships and after reading this book, I just know you're the one for me. If I can have just one night with you. I just, I just wanna... ♫ I know it wasn't on purpose ♫ Now I know I love this, love this, love this - Get up offa me! - Oh my God! Oh, so much for fucking self-help books. You psycho. They want you to believe that you're crazy. But we know that you're not. I'm not crazy. I'm smart, I'm beautiful, I'm kind, but most importantly, my heart is pure. You cannot sit around worrying about some man's opinion of you. You will not allow him to dictate how you should feel about yourself. Mm, mm, mm, what you need to do is, you need to walk up to him and ask him, "Why did you have sex with me" "and allow me to disappear like I'm worthless?" No, no, no no no no, I don't need your apology. I don't even want your company. I just need closure. Hey baby, you hungry? No, I'm about to get outta here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you leaving? Yeah, I got a lot of work to do today. Okay fine, but I was trying to make you a sandwich. I read that when your man puts it down, you're supposed to make him a sandwich. Where'd you read that? It doesn't matter. Bo, come here for a second. Baby, I really gotta go. Just a second. Do you love me? Do I love you? Girl, I wanna marry you and have babies with you. You mean everything to me, but I gotta go to work. Speaking of work. That's them right there. But listen, when I get back, I'm gonna take a shower and it's just me and you, I promise. Okay? Give me a kiss. Love you. Love you too. Hello? You on him? Girl, I'm on him like flies on a nasty ho. My girl. What's up, girl, you ready? Let's go. What's your location? I'm on 59, headed North.

I love it. Where you at now? Yes, you know I am on 59 on the feeder. I just saw him go towards Fountain View. Hello? I got you, man, like a dog, this douche can't hold me back! Oh shit, that's how you do it, boo, that's how you do it, that's how you pull up. Look y'all, we just got a tell from Celeste on Bo's whereabouts. Henrietta girl, you want a bat? You want the golf club? Which one we feeling? Girl, is that a sledge hammer? Do you see him? They're right there. You know what, I was trying to be cool. Fuck it, let's go. Get the golf club. Babe...

Look girl, it's okay 'cause we'll get his little trifling ass next time. Right. Right. You wanna talk about it? Talk about what? Last night, what you may or may not have said. Hear no evil, see no evil, smell, he says no evil, I said nothing. I cheated on you, Alex. It was a one-time affair. Affair? It happened more than once? We don't talk, we don't laugh, we don't... We can, we can do, I can really do what you're saying you don't do. I'm ready to do it right now. Put your hand on the table, you'll find out. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm saying somewhere it got stale and maybe you didn't notice because you were too busy sleeping around yourself. So it's my fault? I helped you, it was teamwork, teamwork make your dream work. You know what, I did see you, baby. I saw so much I can't even un-see it. I wish I could un-see what I saw, but I can't. I'm sorry. So what now? I don't know, I don't know, you tell me. You're the one with the mistress or the mister or whatever you want to call him. I don't want a divorce. Do you? No. What do you want, Alex? I want my wife back. You wanna know what I want? ♫ I'm zooming through the night, I'm zooming through the air ♫ Moving too fast, trying to catch what's there ♫ My heart has been lost and has never seen space ♫ What you feel inside, moving in a fast pace ♫ Girl, you cheatin' me, that's who you been sleeping with ♫ Right now it's happening, girl ♫ Get your bag, get your shit, get you right through this ♫ Girl I'm through with you ♫ Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh tonight ♫ Oh whoa, whoa, whoa ♫ Tonight, tonight, tonight ♫ You can have it all, you can have it all ♫ Tonight, tonight, tonight, you got it baby ♫ You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it baby ♫ Tonight, tonight, tonight Whoa. What you doing? I'm trying to kiss my husband. No, no, no. Why, it's just a kiss, Alex. To you it's just a kiss, but to me, it's a gateway drug to some serious sexual activity and I know you not trying to do all that. How do you know what I wanna do? Because I know you. You don't be popping it off. Where'd you get that from? From you, you like your sex with a glass of Chardonnay and a nice romance novel. Are you trying to say I'm stuck up? No, I'm not trying to say you stuck up, I'm just saying you like your sex with a little culture, a little oui oui, I don't have a little oui oui. Maybe I've changed. Wait, you said what now? Maybe I've changed. - You said you change? - Yeah. Oh, is that actual and factual 'cause if you changed, you just woke up the master. Master B is in the house. I'm about to, hold on, wait a minute. Take them drawers off. Show me how you changed 'cause I'm ready for some change. You know what, you're right. I just woke up wanting to kiss my husband. So, since you wouldn't let me. Wait, wait, hold on, how about I trade you 20 kisses. - That's a lot. - 10 kisses. - 10, okay. - 10 kisses... - Okay. - For 10 You know you want that. Whatever, later. Wait hold on, where you going? I need to get my day started, sir. We got plans. Let's get on 10 of those kisses, 10 of those That's what I'm talking about. So inquiring minds want to know, was he really cheating on you? Mmhmm. But you were cheating on him too. Yes, I was. But the only difference is that you were cheating on him after you realized that he was cheating on you first. Exactly. Okay, so how'd you know? What, that he was cheating? Yeah, like did you go through his text messages, did you see him in person cheating with somebody or girl, are you stalking him like I'm doing my man, Bo? Quinn, no. Okay then how do you know? I felt it. You felt it. Girl stop, 'cause if every woman left their man because they felt like he was cheating, 80% of the world would be breaking up right now. And they would be right to do so. What? Look Quinn, if a person is cheating, you don't need any proof. You don't need Maury or Jerry or anything else. All you need is your gut. You feel that shit right there. You don't understand that feeling. You don't even know where that feeling came from, but what you do know is that shit is real and it hurts. I almost left Alex. I probably should've left Alex. But I didn't because I could see who he can be for... So wait, you choose to cheat on him? I choose to teach him a lesson. So you got caught on purpose? And that worked? Like a charming bracelet. Damn Liv. You's a bad bitch. Please believe me. Okay. It's a good day to be jogging, right? Very. So where are you heading to? That way. Want some water? No, I'm good, I have a goal. Have fun. All right, you have a good one. You too. Mmhmm. That was nice. Oh so, I didn't tell you the other day, someone was peeping into the door from across the street and when I opened the door to see who it was, they just took off running. That was crazy, right? Hm, I shut mine off. Yeah, it happened. Something else, that's crazy. That's real crazy. You're not gonna get the door? That's crazy. That's why your phone gonna die, lazy. - I love you baby. - Yeah, okay. He's so lazy, oh. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm well, how are you? I'm good. I just moved into your neighborhood and I noticed that you lived here and this might sound a little cliche, but I'm baking cake for my man and I ran out of sugar. Can I borrow some? Um, okay, but do... Oh forgive me, my name is Lindsey. I bumped into you at the park the other day while you were exercising. At the park, I remember. I'm Olivia. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm intruding. You know what, nevermind. No, no, no, it's, sugar, come on I have sugar. Are you sure? Absolutely. Oh, you're such a sweetheart. Mmhmm, come in. Wow, your home's beautiful. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'll be right back, cup. Thank you. Oh that's a cute cup, adorable. I know. Right, I'll be right back. You know, you moved into a great area. It's so safe around here, the neighbors leave the doors unlocked. Your furniture is magnificent. Ah, here you go. Are you okay? Oh, I'm great. Here you are, there's your sugar. Thank you. Oh he's gonna be such a happy man. I hope so. Yeah, yeah, your door. My door. Thanks Oliva, bye. Bye bye. Bye. New neighbors, crazy neighbor. Really. You know I never really stopped loving you, right? Hm, okay. I mean, that little gesture you did on the mirror in the bathroom was cute, but... Little gesture? What, what are you talking about? I'm talking your little romantic gesture that you have in the bathroom for me. Ges... I thought it was sweet. You know I always go to the restroom in the middle of the night and wanted to say something nice. I appreciate it. I know you normally don't do love notes and things like that, but I like it a lot, good stuff. Sniff alone. Asking for a friend, what do you do if your man finds a used condom in the fridge? Mm, are there small children inside of this condom? Yes. Mm, you messed up on third base. Go back to 101. Anybody know the second rule of cheating? Mr. Ashtray? Always have an escape route. Is this always possible? Oh, if you're smart. Those who cheat successfully are always 10 steps ahead of their significant others, according to chapter two, page 247, should always meet somewhere you know like you know the back of your hand, where the exits are, if the windows are open, if there's locks on the basement door. Sometimes not getting caught is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity, page 263. Professor Keating, may I have a word with you, please? - Now. - Of course. Of course, just a minute. Class, you just feel free to go over your notes. Be prepared for a discussion when I return. All right, study, study diligent. Diligently. You, you, you and you all look so familiar, hm. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Yes, what are you doing here? Didn't you wonder if I was okay? I mean, the last time you saw me, I was lying unconscious on your dining room floor. Didn't you wonder what happened to me? Liar! Can you bring it down, can you bring it down just a little bit? You're, I really, really, really hope for your sake, that you didn't think you can just have sex with me and then dump me off on the side of the road, literally! - No, no, no, wait... - Literally, dumped me off on the side of the road! Don't, you're doing too much, please stop. Okay, I just need you to calm down... No, no, don't you dare tell me to calm down. I will not calm down. Who the hell are you to tell me to calm down? Listen, listen, look, look, look, can we talk about this someplace else other than outside of my classroom? Yes, please, yes? Please? - Very well. - Thank you. Where? Our same spot. When? Bout an hour I'm gonna wrap this class up and just... Professor Keating, you have 45 minutes. 45 minutes, mmhmm. Okay, 45, you're so aggressive. Just calm, go have a drink on me, go ahead. ♫ If dogs would ever drown ♫ It would mean that thing to y'all ♫ I guess that's why we fall ♫ In a knot of loss, see I, selfish as it seems ♫ Want you here with me ♫ Without you I can't feel ♫ And without you I will Hey girl. - All right. - I'm good.

Is this real, is this Sign the contract. God, this is a lot of money. We, at VBS, we realize you're a major asset to any television station. We wanna be in the business of cheating, but not only that, we wanna be in the business of cheating with Professor Keating. - So... - Sign the contract. Sign the contract. Pass me the pen... All right. Great deal. All right, all right. Now we celebrate. - Celebrate. - Oh yeah. On, on you, all right. You don't have to walk me home. Yes I do, you're drunk, you're drunk. No I'm not. I'm gonna walk you. I am an independent woman. You can barely say independent, independent. Independent. Don't you dare. Don't you, don't, no, no, no you better not. No, you better swallow it, swallow it, swallow it, you know y'all like to swallow it up. Say, hm, swallow, swallow it. There you go, there you go, that's all you, all... Don't just be... I got it, I got it, I swallowed it. I'm sorry, it's all good. Last time I threw up in public was in college. College, you don't put an H in college. You're breath stinks, little freaky breath. All right. Okay. I have to go home alone. My husband, Chandler, he's with a girl that's like a younger, prettier version of me and her boobs, they're like up here and they're huge. They're so big. And then her ass is this big juicy ass and it's like it's so big, it can't be real, it can't be real. Like, it's like she's like an S shape. Her back, her back has to hurt. Her back hurts man, it has to. I have to talk to her chiropractor. Hey. Hey. Take me. Take you where? Downtown. Take me to bed. Take me, sex me, show, show me what makes you so legendary. See, I'm angry, I'm bitter. My mini hasn't been taken care of in so long. I'm not gonna kiss you and I'm not gonna have sex with you. Let it happen. No. Oh my God! I can't even get the easiest guy to have sex with me. I'm gonna sit here and I'm going to wallow in my attractiveness. Unless you wanna go inside with me. Okay, I'm leaving. No, no. Okay, I'll see you Monday? Meow Mix, mommy's home Meow Mix. Open the door for me, open the door for me. Shut up. Shut the fuck... Hey, hey! What the? Fuck wrong with you? Get off! Yeah, something's... You picked the wrong house to get into. I have a gun. Help? All my life I've been struggling with the notion that I might just be crazy. Men are always saying it to me and every time they say it, I feel it and it hurts me, Alex, it hurts me to my core. Why can't I have a thought? Why can't I question your bad behavior without being called crazy? Well guess what, Alex? I realized something thanks to you. I am crazy and not just a little crazy, I'm a fucking psychopath. You see, my father, that bastard left me without saying goodby. I begged him not to leave and he left anyway. At the age of five, he beat me mercilessly until he couldn't stand the sight of me. Congratulations to my first boyfriend who raped me, my second boyfriend who raped me, my third boyfriend I gave my heart, my soul, my being, everything to, who raped me! To you, I say, congratulations, you all have awakened the beast in me. You will feel my wrath. Alex, you will feel my wrath. Okay, I'm here, what? Where's Mrs. Keating? At home, I guess, why? We think your girlfriend's trying to kill us. What girlfriend? Fabrae, you saw a couple nights ago. She came into the classroom and she pointed at Bonnie and Frank and myself and Ashton and she said she remembered us and now Makaela's missing and Frank and Wes are dead! Yeah and she did this to me. You remember this? This is not makeup. I have to carry a taser now. What, why would Fabrae kill Frank and Wes and then attack you? Look, the night you were with Fabrae, Fabrae. We were there. What do you mean you were there? We came over and we just wanted to hang out with you. Frank and I think that you have been working really hard lately and you needed to cut loose... The door was open, we walked in and saw you with Fabrae. When Mrs. Keating came home unexpectedly, we hid. And when the coast was clear, we grabbed Fabrae, threw her in the car and I am truly embarrassed to say this, considering that, you know, Frank is dead, but he said to throw her ass on the side of the road. Look, we didn't want you to get caught. We were trying to save you, okay? So you kidnapped Fabrae, she woke up on the side of the road not knowing how she got there and no wonder she's upset... I told them we needed to call the police. Tell 'em what, that we kidnapped a woman and now she's out for revenge? So everybody who was in the house that night is in danger? Including my wife? Especially your wife. Hey, Olivia babe, it's me. When you get this message, I need you to call me back as soon as you can. Lock the doors, don't let anybody in the house. Quinn, goodness, come on. I'm tired. Let's go, come on. - Come on. - Wait, wait, tired. Okay, here we go. Oh, tie your shoes. Oh shit. Yo, get out of the street, a car coming. All right, hold on. Shit. What happened to my wife? We were just out night jogging and this car was just following us and basically just tried to take out Liv. Like the shit was crazy, it was like a scene from that scary movie, um, the car, "Christine", do you remember it? Yeah, it was scary. I thought Liv was a goner, like she ran to a dead end and I thought the car was gonna get her, but it literally just pulled up on her and stopped and then it just drove a way like it was nothing. It was the craziest shit I've ever seen. Whoever was driving the car, they were deliberately trying to take out Liv. Would you know anything about that? I think I might. Yeah, oh yeah smell that, smell that, smell that. Smell that. Breakfast in bed? You must have really been afraid for me last night. Yeah, no, I was, I was. Thank you, babe. Yeah, you want me to feed you? You want me to feed you? No, I got it. Oh, okay, well look, I canceled all your appointments for the day so just feel free to rest up. Okay. All right. Well I'm gonna go take out the trash and I'm gonna be right back up to check on you, okay? Okay. Cute self. Hey. Hm? Love you. Love you more. Get out of my car, get out of my car. Get out. Good morning, sunshine. Don't, don't, don't get, know what? I'm calling the police, I'm calling the police. Oh... - I'm calling the police. - Go right ahead. Right now, right now, this is about to be over right now. You know, they're just gonna ask me to leave and then you have to explain to me Well actually, you and her car. Are you all, whatever. Either or. So do you wanna get into the car and have a conversation with me? I think so, come on. Come on. I like your onesie. Have a seat. Okay, what, what do you want? Oh, you are so handsome. No, no, no, okay, stop, stop, stop. It's early in the morning, I'm hot. I'm in a onesie. Give me a kiss. I don't wanna give you a kiss that much. Alex! Alex! Oh shit. Alex. Where did he go? Babe? Gotta be around here somewhere. Where he went to? Doesn't make any sense. Don't call me today. This is Olivia. I like you, Olivia, I really, really do, but this little farce of a relationship you have with my husband ends today. 556 Mulhouse Lane. Alex, oh, sweetheart, you have to be more careful. Fabrae, what are you doing? - What... - Oh, let me help you up. Come on, ready? On the count of three, one, two, three. Oh. I watched you, Alex. I watched you and that slut that you call a wife. I watch you guys laughing and smiling and eating and loving. Oh, I watch you pretend that you're in love with her just tormenting yourself. You don't love her. You love me. That's not true. - That's... - I understand why you lied to me because you love me. I get it. But I don't. Where's my wedding ring? Where's my ring? Look, they're right here. That's not mine. That's not my... Marriage is the ultimate proof that someone loves you and these rings, they symbolize that. You're crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, Fabrae, you're the crazy one, but nonetheless, you're married to me now. I do. You do, we all do. But I don't, I don't, actually... Shh. There are no words or obstacles that can keep you and me apart. I love you. Don't you worry. I've taken care of everything and almost everyone. What do you mean everyone? I didn't say everyone, I said almost everyone. Right on time. You stay right here, don't you move a muscle. Alex! Welcome, you dirty little bitch. Excuse me? I don't know what he sees in you. You're not pure, you're not honest. Okay crazy lady, where's my husband? Crazy lady. You lied to his face and sleep with every man that comes across your path and you stand in our home and call me crazy. Bitch, you need a cleansing. Wait a minute, who lives here? This is our home. Alex and I, we live as man and wife. So you, okay. Um, where's the man of the house? Where he should be, in my bed. Bitch he better not be there. Come here, bitch. Come here, come. Woo, come on, get up. Come on. Come on, I'm not done with you. We're not done. You want your husband? Come and get him. Woo. Woo. Olivia, wake up, wake up, Olivia. Wake up, baby, wake up, wake up. You know I'm doing this for you. Because you will never be happy as long as this little slut! Is walking the streets. I love you, baby. Let's go, missy, come on, let's go. Olivia, no, no... This is for you. No, no. Mmhmm, settle down. I love you, baby. Time for your bath. Get off my wife. Get off my wife. My, my, my ring.
