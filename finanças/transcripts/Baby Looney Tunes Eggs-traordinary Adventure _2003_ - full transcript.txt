[music continues] [instrumental music] [wind whooshing] Oh, Granny? Did you see my little toy bucket? Yes, dear. It's right next to your teddy bear. [instrumental music] [Granny humming] Oh, here it is. Thanks, Granny. Huh? [squeaks] You're welcome, dear. [music continues] ♪ Doo dee-do do do-do-do ♪ ♪ Dee-do do do ♪ [groans] Oh, my! [creaking] thump 'Well, this isn't so bad.' 'It will keep the hot sun off my little head.' - Hi, Tweety. - 'Hi, Lola.' - Hey, Tweety. - 'Hi, Sylvester.' Where are you going? (Tweety) 'Me and my bucket are gonna play in the sandbox.' - Uh-oh. - Heh, didn't anybody tell him? (Tweety) 'Tell me what?' [screaming] thud That. [groaning] Oh, my goodness! [instrumental music] And who said you could enter the castle of Daffy the Great? Your castle? But I thought this was our sandbox. Not today, pal. I'm playing King of the Mountain. Ooh, that sounds like a fun game. So, who gets to be the king? You're lookin' at him! Daffy, King of the Mountain! Master of all I survey. From the teeter-totter to the swing set. From the sandbox to the slide. All this is mine, forever! Well, at least, until lunch. Even a king's gotta eat. But tell Granny it's mac and cheese or I'm not coming down. And tell her to forget those little round green things. They're gross. Brussels sprouts? No, the other ones. Lima beans? Yeah. Uh, kings don't like those. Sorry, Tweety. That's what we forgot to tell you. 'Daffy's been up there since breakfast.' And he won't let anybody play in his sandbox. Not even if you ask nice? Not even if you ask not nice. I've been swingin' and slidin' and teeter-totterin' till my tail's sore. Oh, when are we gonna get to play in some nice, soft sand? When the king says we can. Huh. What if we got a different king, a nicer one? Yeah! But who? (all) Huh? Ten, four.. Um, eight eleven.. Another number. One! Blast off for the moon! Nnneeaoowww! Whoosh-sh-sh! Nnneeaoowww! Whoosh-sh-sh! Nnneeaoowww! Whoosh-sh-sh! Ohh! thud Ah, great. [instrumental music] (Lola) 'Hey, Bugs?' You know how you're always telling us that you're the most grown-up? The biggest and the bravest? The natural leader? Did I say that? Okay, we threw in the big and brave part, but hey! You were right about being the leader. Right, gang? - Right! - Oh. If I'm so grown up, how come that's as close as I can get to the moon? Oh, you know what Granny says. "Growing up takes time, so.." (both) "Just enjoy being a kid." But what we say is you can skip all that growing-up stuff and get a whole lot closer to the moon, right now! Eh? Eh, what's the catch? No catch. It's simple. You're already our leader. All you gotta do is be our king. - 'No way!' - Huh? I'm the king! Ah, pay no attention. He's just keepin' the royal throne warm for you. Think of it, from up there you'd be halfway to the moon already. Now, wait a minute. All in favor of Bugs being the king? (in unison) Me! Hey! I demand a recount! Sorry, Daffy, we can't count. Come on, guys, you just want me to kick Daffy out so you can play in the sandbox. But ya gotta! You're the, the head guy. It's your duty. We're relying on you. Do it for your loyal subjects.. Please? Oh, alright, alright. [cheering] Now, go get rid of that pretender-to-the-throne. [sighs] Hey, wait! Um, new election. All in favor of me being king, raise your hand. [instrumental music] Who-oah! Either hand, doesn't matter. Wiggle a finger? Bat an eyelash? Tiny twitch of the nose? Anybody? Oh. You're despicable. [cheering] But what about me gettin' to the moon? Huh? For now, just enjoy being a kid. Oh. Hiya, Granny. Hello, you little dears. Lunchtime. That's what a pussycat likes to hear. And for dessert, I'll read you all a story. [all cheering] Yes, Daffy? So, what's for lunch, Granny? Mac and cheese, your favorite. With any of those little green things? Lima beans? [chuckles] Oh, goodness. No. Brussels sprouts. I'm there! (Granny)Once upon a time oh, I thinkeven before I was little there was a magical place deep in the forest. And here, every year on a certain day in spring something special happened. Something wonderful. (Taz) 'Ya-hoo!' [Taz cackling] Yes, it was Easter and the kids came from all around to fill their baskets with eggs and candy and.. [gasps] [indistinct shouting] Oh, my. Watch where you're going. [indistinct chatter] Who-oah! Eh, Taz, do you mind? We're trying to hear about Easter. - And candy! - Ah! And finding all kinds of pretty Easter eggs. [Taz laughing] And candy! [laughing] [sighs] Your turn, Bugs. I got him last time. Na-unh! I got him twice then. Why is it my turn again? - 'Cause you're the leader. - Who says? (both) You do. Oh! Yeah. Oh! Just wanna hear a story. Tryin' to have a little fun.. Oh, don't worry, Bugs, dear. I'll wait until you're back. Thanks, Granny. Now, where did that guy go? [tires screeching] [screams] [laughing] Hey! [blabbering] Bugs! Come on, we gotta help him. [instrumental music] After that bunny! Ho, ho, ho, ho. Go get him, Tweety! Ye-ay! Oh! - Bugs! - Okay, big fella. Time to slow it down. No slow, Taz go fast! No, slow! - Fast! - Slow! - Fast! - Slow! Fast! Fast! No! No! [screaming] Huh? Oh, no! Ugh! - Aah! - Aah! [screaming] Got you! Ahh! Oh! Nice catch. (both) Daffy! [laughing] Ohh! Now, look what ya did! Why don't ya watch what you're mashing? Ha-ha! Taz mash! Taz mash! Taz mash! Taz mash! [imitating honking] bam [laughing] Huh? [cackling] (Bugs) 'Come on, big guy, story time.' Story? [laughing] Oh, yes, a story all about a magical meadow 'that comes to life on Easter morning.' And a bunny who hides beautiful eggs for all the children to find. - Bunny? - Why yes, dear. The Easter Bunny. 'He brings baskets of jellybeans and marshmallow eggs' 'and milk-chocolate chickens.' Baskets full of milk-chocolate chickens? The brain boggles. This could beat Halloween. Hmm. But the Bunny brings more than candy. 'To see him you have to be young at heart.' 'And let yourself believe that such things are real.' Wouldn't it be wonderful if that place could be real? Oh, I wish it was. [chuckles] I used to wish wishes like that when I was your age. Two months ago you were his age. But just think if it was real, we could go there. Where do you think it would be? How long would it take? Do you think we should pack a lunch? I think we should bag the whole thing. Bunny. Yeah, right. Eggs come from chickens. [instrumental music] [screams] Taz want Easter. Of course, you do, dear, but it's not Easter yet. No Easter? Not for another day. [instrumental music] [sobbing] Oh! Oh, not again! Get ready. [all gasp] [screaming] Oh, my. Yes, waiting is simply awful. ♪ Ya la la la la ♪ ♪ Ya la la la la ♪ ♪ Ya la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da da da dah ♪ [bawling] ♪ Ya da da da da da ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da da ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da da da dah ♪ [bawling] [instrumental music] [music continues] Eh.. ♪ Ya la la la la la ♪ ♪ Ya la la la la la ♪ ♪ Ya da da da da da da dah ♪ [Taz laughing] Eh.

Then supper, then bed. - Yeah? - After that. Oh, he'll never last that long. What are we gonna do? Get Granny to read him the story 800 more times? Tweety says, give him a great big hug to tide him over till the Bunny comes. Daffy says, forget the Bunny. Put up a Christmas tree and tell him Santy's coming. It always makes me happy. Hey, I got it. [whirring] - 'Ah! Ha, ha, ha, ha!' - Huh? [laughing] Look, Taz, we're practicin' hunting eggs for when the Bunny comes. Come on, kid. Gotta get warmed up for the big day.

Eh, what's the problem, Daffy? This Bunny thing's bogus. What do you think he is, Santa Claus? That guy's for real, I got the toys to prove it. But a rabbit who leaves eggs? Wake up, you're dreamin'. - What? No! - Huh? [Taz panting] Shh. Would you cut it out? Taz'll hear. Aw, let him. He's two years old. Time he knew the truth. What truth? There's no such thing. Oh, no, don't tell me you guys believe this stuff. Absolutely! We...we saw it in the book. He-he. Ha.. H-hey, listen, I'm with you. No Bunny, no harm done. But if it's real and we don't believe, you can kiss those chocolate-covered chickens goodbye! I'd go with it. So, once again, the duck stands alone. Wait a sec! We haven't heard from our fearless leader. Well? [all gasping] Eh.. He-he. Well, uh, sure. I-i-it'd be great if a bunny comes around and, uh, brings eggs a-and hides 'em for us. - Eh, to find, I mean. Heh. - Hmm. [screaming] Easter! Ho-ha-hoo! Easter! [giggling] Eh, sure. Great, knock yourself out there, big fella. See? The Bunny brings eggs. Bugs said. - He said.. - He, he, ha! Ah! Ho, ho, hoo! - "...if." - 'Easter.' What do you mean, "If?" Don't you believe it's real? You mean, for really real? [giggling] Well, yeah. What other kind of real is there? How should I know? I've never seen that place Granny's talkin' about. Maybe it's just pretend. Maybe Daffy's right? [all gasping] Now, that's usin' the ol' fuzz between those ears. A clear-cut case of brains over silliness. Okay, come on, just, uh don't tell Taz, alright? Ah! Hoo-ho! Easter! He-he, ha, haa! Easter! [frog croaking] Sure, it'll just be our little secret. Heh-heh. Hey, that's great, Taz. Yeah, really great. Eh, come on, guys, you asked me what I thought. I was just trying to just, uh.. Come on, let them go. They got a lotta growin' up to do. "Easter Bunny." Ha, ha, ha, ha! That's a good one. Easter Bunny! [Daffy laughing] [instrumental music] [humming] [laughs] My, my! This miracle flower food lives up to its name, alright. What would Easter be without flowers? (Tweety) 'Oh, what would it be without the Bunny?' Huh? Whatever do you mean, Tweety dear? Daffy says there's no such thing as the Easter Bunny. Yeah. He says it's bogus. Well, well. He does, does he? Yeah, and Bugs almost believes him. (both) Huh? Some people only believe in the things they can see. That sounds like Daffy, alright. Some people believe that 'all sorts of wonderful things are possible.' Like you, Tweety. And Taz. And some people well, they're just not sure what to believe. (both) Bugs. They're missing all the fun. - Huh! - Huh! Hey! I know what to do. Granny, can we borrow some flowers? Why, of course, dear. What's the plan, Tweety? Oh, we're gonna make Bugs have fun whether he believes in it or not. [exhales] You sure this is gonna change Bugs' mind about the Easter Bunny? (Lola) 'Posi-lootely.' He'll have so much fun at our Easter party he won't listen to Daffy ever again. [balloon popping] We'll see. Hey, what was that noise? [slurping] Oh, just my cute good looks getting rearranged. - Hiya, Bugs. - You're just in time. Time? Time for what? (both) An Easter party. And you're invited. Me? Uh, well, uh, thanks. Uh, but I thought you guys were sorta mad at me because I didn't think there was a, uh, you know. Us? Nah. So, ready to have lots of fun? Sure, I guess that'd be-- (Lola) 'Then let's play "Pin The Tail On The Easter Bunny."' [screaming] [chuckles] Well, eh, okay.. Heh-heh. - Eh, am I gettin' closer? - You're doing great. We'll be right back with refreshments. I'll get Taz. [rattling] Huh! Oh, I've got to drive a silly.. [indistinct blabbering] [blabbering] Huh! Hmm. And just what do you think you are doing? Oh, ah, hi, Daff. I'm, eh, pinnin' the tail on the, um, you know, the, uh, Easter Bunny. I thought we understood each other. I thought it was gonna be our little secret. What secret? [grunts] That there's no such thing as the Easter Bu.. Shh! Taz might hear. Anyway, i-it's just a game. Eh, I don't think that's where it goes. I don't care where it goes. Would you look at yourself? You're supposed to be the oldest. You're supposed to be our leader. Alright, alright! No wonder everybody's runnin' around talking about chocolate chickens 'little rabbits that lay colored eggs.' Look at the example you're setting. Okay. I said alright! (Daffy) 'So, for the last time, would you forget the Bunny?' Daffy, I said alright! [grunts] [grunts] Ah? [Lola crying] No! Uh, wait a minute. I mean, I can explain. I-I didn't do it. I mean, I-I did do it, eh but I didn't mean to do it! I-I mean.. [sobbing] How could you? (Bugs) 'But, but-but-but..' 'But this isn't what it seems.' Okay, I-I know what it looks like, but believe me what it looks like isn't what it is. splat [laughs] splat [slurps] Angel food? - Hmm. - Lola, Tweety. No, wait! [chuckles] Hey, least you could do is throw some devil's food. Now, that's my favorite. Okay, Taz, time for the big Easter...party? Party! Party! Party! pop [sighs] Nap time, little ones. Tomorrow is Easter. - Aren't you excited? - Yeah. Swell. [sobbing] Oh. Hmph. [instrumental music] Look. I am the Easter Bunny. I am the Easter Bunny. [laughing] Oh. - You forgot something. - There's nothing in there. So, it seems. - Unless you look harder. - Huh? I still don't see anything. It's empty. I see it full. Full of dreams and hopes and happiness. But there's nothin' there. You just have to look with other eyes. What eyes? When you find them, then you'll see. [instrumental music] [laughing] [Taz laughing] [music continues] Psst. Tweety? Hey! Huh? Ohh! [instrumental music] Shh. Come on. [instrumental music] (Lola) 'Hey, Sylvester!' [Sylvester gasps] (Lola) 'Shh! It's us.' (Sylvester) Huh, who, what? (Lola) We got a problem. (Tweety) Yeah, and it's a whopper! What if Easter comes, but the Bunny doesn't? Taz will cry for a week. What do we do? Plug our ears. I got some gum. No. If we chew it first? I mean, he'll be sad. It'll break his little heart. Oh, yeah. Poor Taz. Wait a minute, poor me. If Taz doesn't get his bunny I don't get my chocolate chickens. [gulps] There's only one thing to do. (Lola) If the Bunny won't come to Taz 'we'll have to take Taz to the Bunny.' So, where is the Bunny? The place in Granny's story book. Let's get it. [instrumental music] Ow-uh! - Shh! - Shh! Come on. [music continues] [laughing] (Lola and Tweety) Shh! [instrumental music] (Lola) 'Look! There it is.' (Tweety) 'Granny's Easter book.' [laughing] Easter, Easter! Shh! You can't climb up there. No? No, Taz. You could fall. Fall? That's when you break your little head. Like this, Ohh! Splat. Shh! [crying] Taz go splat! Shh! Nobody's gonna go splat. I'll get the book for you. [sobbing] For me? For you. Oh, thank you, Lola. Yeah, fine, don't mention it. [gasps] Stay here and keep quiet. Ah, shh! [grunting] [instrumental music] Huh? Huh? [intense music] [all gasping] [panting] Whoa! Hu-uh! [gasps] Oh, my. [panting] Lola! Look out! [gasps] [intense music] [gulps] [grunts] [cheering] Shh! [cheering] Lola! Lola! Lola-- - Shh! - Shh! [instrumental music] [grunting] [gasps] [grunting] Um, Lola? What? Now that you got up, how you gonna get down? Uh-oh! [gasps] Lola go splat? [screams] Look out! Taz wanna ride. 'Taz wanna ride.' Whoa! [gasps] [screaming] (Lola) 'Taz, no!' [laughing] Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! No, that's a train. Huh? [imitating a car horn] That's a car. [imitating a rooster crowing] Close enough. Whoa! (both) Oh! Look out! [panting] - Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Ha-ha! Easter! Huh?

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Huh? Well, guess who was here? Taz? Well, it wasn't the Easter Bunny. Hey, look! - Huh! - Huh! [laughing] What's that doing here? And where did everybody go? I think they went lookin' for that.. the place where the Easter Bunny lives. But that place isn't real. That's real. They're not gonna find any bunny. The only thing out there is pine cones and tree squirrels. They're just gonna get lost. They'll...never come back. If they don't, can I have Taz's remote control bulldozer? No. That purple and orange fright wig Lola wears on Halloween? No. I'd look good in it. They're not gonna get lost, 'cause we're gonna find 'em. What do you mean, we? Hey, where're we going? Hey! Ah, come on. This is nutso. We'll never find 'em. We ought to go home. We'll find 'em. Wait, i-isn't that Granny calling us? We better go home. That isn't Granny. [instrumental music] [imitating howling] Hey! What was that? The cry of a hungry tree squirrel? They can get pretty nasty in these parts. We better go home. Daffy, would you come on? Alright, alright. Hey, I'm just lookin' out for our safety. [instrumental music] Easter, yet? No, Taz. Easter, yet? Not yet, Taz. Huh! Uh, Taz tired. Come to think of it. [yawning] Naptime doesn't sound like a such a bad idea. But we have to keep going. Taz, don't you want to find Easter? [sniffling] No Easter. Yes, there is, Taz. We saw it in the book! Come on, we'll find it. Tweety, you believe we will, don't you? I don't know, Lola. We've been looking for a long time. We can't give up now. What if, what if it's right over that hill? With baskets full of chocolate chickens? Hm. You know, candy always did beat naptime. Come on, just one more hill. That's the spirit! Okay. Come on, Taz. Easter Bunny. Bunny? I hope so. [instrumental music] Would you look at that? [gasps] Easter? [gasps] You can almost smell the chocolate chickens! But where are the little birds? Asleep. It's their naptime too. Ha, Easter! No, Taz. That's a rock. No Easter? Afraid not. (Sylvester) 'Ow! Hey, watch it, will ya'?' Sorry, Sylvester. Ah. Easter? No, Taz. That's another rock. Rock. (Sylvester) 'Ow!' I looked all over. Nothing but rocks. You think it's 'cause the Bunny hid the eggs really well? I hope so. We better find something soon. Taz isn't very happy. He isn't the only one. [blows raspberry] [screaming] Hey! Good work, Daffy! They came this way for sure! Eh, let's look around! Maybe we can find more! Huh! No more! Forget it! I want my nap! This little lost duck is going to go home! - Are we there yet? - Shh. Look! We just have to keep looking, that's all. Remember what Bugs said? What if Daffy's right? What if there isn't any bunny? Don't even say that! Hey, what'd I do? Bunny or no bunny, Taz is gonna get his Easter. And I know how we can do it. - We? - Yeah. You'll do just fine. Do? Do what? [indistinct whispering] We looked everywhere. Maybe this isn't the right place. [sobbing] Huh? Rock? No, Taz. Not a rock. Look! Huh? It's, it's.. Easter!
