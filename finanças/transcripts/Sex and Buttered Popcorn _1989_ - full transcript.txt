- I see a title for this piece in the form of a quote ad. You all know what a quote ad is. "Extraordinary," says the Times. "Beautiful," says the News. Well, I would have something that says, quote: "Dreadful," says the Daily News. "Degrading," says the Morning Times. "Deplorable," says the Evening Journal. "And get out of town" says the chief of police (laughs) - So he said, "You better keep your mouth shut, "you big bastard." He says, "Or I'll knock hell outta ya." And so I figured, "Well, if this guy is gonna knock "hell out of me when I get downstairs, "I'd better get him right here." (laughing) So I jumped on top of him, right there and there, and I bit him on top of the head, and we rolled down the balcony stairs, and I kept biting him on the head. - I'm recording history. - [Dan] You know, you oughta write for Bob Hope. - I am recording history and this is how it happened and what happened and you've had... - Listen, I might've called her a (train whistle) but not a (bell dinging) (laughing) Ya know, that's my name. I call people (train whistle) not (bell dinging) - There goes PBS (laughs) I have always said that when they're talking about exploitation film that you can shock them, you can make them laugh, you can make them cry. You can do any damn thing in the world you want to them except bore them and that's the cardinal sin in the film business, or in show business per se. But I always said that maybe two or three days after Mr. Edison made these tintypes gallup, some enterprising guy got his girlfriend to take off her clothes and shot the film and sex in the cinema was born. And it's been around a long, long time. (dramatic music) - Abraham Lincoln once said "You may fool all the people some of the time. You can even fool some of the people all the time but you can't fool all the people all the time." Of course, there have always been those who thought that they should try. When I was a kid back in the days when movie screens commanded more attention than any other form of entertainment, there were some fearless perpetrators of hokum and hype who traveled the highways and the byways hoping to fool everyone into seeing their picture show. They promised a lot. Uncut, uncensored, unashamed. They papered the town with handbills selling sin, sex and salvation, not necessarily in that order. They were called road showmen, celluloid salesmen and The 40 Thieves. And for the most part, their product was called awful, degrading and deplorable. Our look back at these movies will reveal some surprises. They were sold in an age of innocence with three magic words, for adults only. - And don't forget I treated you nice, right? Was I fresh with you? See, okay get dressed. - [Ned] They were called exploitation films made and pedaled by intrepid itinerate showmen who collected the wages of sin. - Hey you. You ain't allowed to park in the street and make googly eyes. - Oh, gee mister, when a fella has to goo, he just has to goo. - Well, goo on and get out of here or I might forget I was young myself once. - [Ned] These men were first and foremost salesmen. Without hesitation, they catered to the socially forbidden and frowned upon appetites of the American public. All the no-nos of proper behavior were yes, yes to these producers of sensationalism. And these films were sensational in the context of that time and place in America's past. Good people could attend these films, be titillated some of the time and still come away with their moral sense of indignation intact. - There, that'll end that disgraceful performance. - [Ned] Morally correct behavior was always the message of these movies and the fact that they had to show wrongdoers and sinners in action to illustrate the point was well, obviously necessary. - This is a crime, two of these girls are nothing but youngsters. - In their infancy, moving pictures were themselves a curiosity, but even then the exploiteers looked for material that was daring. (sensual music) The kiss from the play The Widow Jones was considered vulgar and the dance performed by Fatima at the 1896 Chicago World's Fair was compassionately censored at some shows, though censorship at that time was the exception, certainly not the rule. (mellow flute music) Short films, many with little or no story were produced for gentlemen only screens. They were not stag films, they were just excuses to show ladies in various stages of undress. (mellow flute music) In Forbidden Daughters, a young lady learns that her husband is being seduced by an African princess and she sets off to bring him back. Seeking help from a local sheik, she witnesses a fit of jealousy in his harem. (mellow flute music) Becoming more involved than a lady should, finds herself imprisoned. (sensual music) The sheik finds her irresistible, perhaps because she's the only one around with clothes on. (mellow flute music) But she escapes to the jungle and stumbles upon her husband and the princess. (sensual music) Her passion aroused, she strips off her clothes and demands her husband choose between them. (sensual music) These early silent skin pictures were to become important tools for the road showmen but we'll explore more on that later. The producers of exploitation mostly came from small towns on the carnival circuits. Their show business dreams inspired by bright midway lights and cotton candy substance. David Friedman and Dan Sonny are two surviving members of that breed. - Dan Sonny and the Sonny family probably the most important single group in the history of the exploitation film. You all know how his father Louis Sonny in 1921 captured Roy Gardner, the most wanted man in the United States and Pantages put the old man on the stage as Officer Sonny, the man who captured Roy Gardner. - [Narrator] This is Roy Gardner, always a front page headliner. But his last press notice that of his sentence was the one most welcome to the public. - [Roy] I have made many grave errors. I broke the law; I went to prison. I paid what society considers a just penalty. I paid the hard way. But now I want to again become a respected citizen. I hope I may and I know I will. - Mr. Sonny, I don't know how to begin to thank you for what you've done for me and I'll do everything humanly possible to justify the confidence that you have placed in me. (marching music) - [Man] But as he lies upon his prison cot his mind cannot cease counting the days, the hours, the minutes, the seconds to the instant when that chair will claim him for his home. Horror turns to madness and then they come for him. He's stopped counting now, oh, let it be over, let it be over. The seconds now seem like years; time is going backward not forward. His entire life with all it's prime passes quickly through his flaming brain until the fatal moment arrives, the signal is given, the switch is thrown and now he knows the all merciful Father. He knows, he knows, crime never pays, crime never pays, crime never... And the rest is silent. (marching music) - I was producing pictures here. I had my producers, Willis Kent and J D Kennis and George Weiss producing pictures for me here in my office and I would put up the money for these guys. So I produced maybe one or two or three pictures a year and I would sell state rights. And Dave for the Chicago territory, he would buy my pictures for the Chicago territory. They would be producing pictures in Chicago and he would sell his pictures to me for my 11 Western states. And so I'm getting a little up in age and I'm getting tired of working. So I asked Dave, I said, "Why don't you come into Los Angeles "and I got an office for you "and you get out of that cold territory there in Chicago "and travel in Hollywood and be a gentleman." (upbeat piano music) - [Ned] These producers wore many hats and often appeared in their films as much to save money as to indulge their acting skills. Dan Sonny is the bartender in this scene while Dave Friedman places a bet over the phone. (receiver clicks) - [Customer] Thanks, Joe. How you doin' tonight, Maria? - Oh I'm fine baby. (dance music) - [Bartender] Another double, Maria? - Believe me, I could use one. I'm in no mood for these crappy books tonight. - Yeah. - I guess you and I are about the only ones left in exploitation of The 40 Thieves and 'cause I'm the youngest of the old generation and you're kind of the... - That's right and I'm the oldest. - In the middle, no you're not, you weren't the oldest, I mean. - Well, I don't know of anybody any older. - [Ned] While a few of the exploitation films could be favorably compared to the Hollywood B pictures of the period, on average, these productions lacked any resemblance to mainstream movies. They were produced for the least possible cost in the shortest period of time. And the results clearly showed on screen. This unremarkable production written by and featuring Lenny Bruce nicely illustrates two standards of the genre, cheap sets and bad acting. Note, the bar in this nightclub, a few stools, one bottle and some glasses on a shelf, hardly realistic. As for the acting, well judge for yourself. - I'm getting bored. - Well, how'd you like to take a trip baby? - A trip? Sounds good, where to? - Hawaii, of course. - What do you mean a trip to Hawaii? - Here, I'll show you. Hey, Jack, this guy wants to take a trip. - To Hawaii? (slow dance music) - Hey Betty, what's going on? What gives what this Hawaii bit? - When a gal kisses a guy, she likes a little privacy. That's why the palm tree is there. - Why do they call it going to Hawaii? - Where do palm trees remind you of, stupid? - Oh, I get it, palm trees, Hawaii. - Oh, what a brain, what a brain. - What a trip, what a trip - [Ned] On location, the same conditions prevailed. If it was a smoggy day, the script would be changed to accommodate the view or the lack of it. Welcome to LA. - [Reporter] Awaited me down there. But quickly... - [Ned] This young reporter is reflecting on an earlier meeting with her editor. - [Reporter] A man who both fascinated and frightened me. - [Ned] The publication must be in trouble, note the bookcase. Maybe nobody reads books, but this is ridiculous. - Mr. Hanson. - Yes. - You sent for me? - Oh yes, I did Miss Sloan. I wanted to have a little talk with you, very confidential. You see for some time now, I've been thinking about you. - Why, what would you be thinking about me? - You'd be surprised. - Oh. (door bell buzzes) - Just a minute. - [Ned] The criteria for appearing in these movies was more a willingness to wear skimpy clothes than an ability to act. And any excuse to get out of their clothes would do. - Hello. - Oh, hello, come on in. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. - Thanks. Gee, it's hot. I think I'll shed this while we sit and chat. - Cigarette? - Yes, thanks. Thank you. - Well, what brings you out on such a warm day? - Oh, I just thought you might like to take a ride down to the beach. - Can't, my sugar daddy may come over today. - Why doesn't he come around in the evenings like other fellas? - (chuckles) This guy can't; he's married. - Well, stand him up. One time won't hurt him. - Not this guy. He might blow up and I don't wanna go back to hashing. - Oh, there are other jobs. - Yeah, but I can't get them. I'm not strong enough for riveting or welding and I'm not smart enough to be a stenographer or a bookkeeper. So I'll just stick to this old goof until some nice young guy comes along that I can marry. (phone rings) That's him now. Hello? Well, yes, honey, come right up. I've been hoping you'd come over today. Sure, I've been lonely without you. Well, of course I do. Okay. He's down at the corner drugstore, coming right up. - Ooh, I better get back to my apartment before he gets here. Bye now. - Bye. (door opens) (door closes) Oh, honey, I'm so glad to see you. - Please, darling don't go too far. Remember you're a lady. - Hi ya, Joan, how about a date? Come on honey, I'll show you a good time. - All right, buddy, out ya go. Come on, get out (stools clattering) (old man shouting indistinctly) - You talk a lot about wanting a family but don't you know that talk won't get you anywhere? - What? - You better get that gigolo out before I get there or I'll kick him out myself. - Wait a minute, Mr. Crane. I've got to find a girlfriend. - Tonight? - Delighted, sure. - You're the gigolo. - Well, of course, what else did you expect? - You're not gonna try to take advantage of me or anything like that? - Most certainly not. - There must be something wrong with this script. - Oh yes, the script. (thudding) The producers had a basic formula, which was built on two simple rules, the lowest possible price and the highest possible titillation factor. The subject matter was anything that mainstream Hollywood wouldn't or couldn't touch. - Well mainstream of course meant the accepted. That means in the motion picture business when you're talking mainstream, you're talking MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, United Artists, et cetera. When you're talking Main Street, you're talking about the films that the Dan Sonnys and the Willis Kents and the J D Kendises and the Dave Friedmans and the Herschel Lewises and the Kroger Babb's made that had no idea of ever playing those palaces uptown and those fine theaters in Westwood or the East Side of New York or Skokie outside of Chicago, but played the Skid Row scratch houses and played some remote drive-ins out in the sticks. And those were Main Street movies as opposed to mainstream movies. - That's a good explanation of it. You did it real good. - Well, thank you, Dan. (somber music) - [Ned] The stories could be lumped into four categories. The first we'll call Antisocial Traditions, titles such as Polygamy and Child Bride are good examples. Such subjects were too controversial for the major studios to handle. (car door slams) - Darling. (mellow music) - Are you really glad to see me? - Why didn't you tell me you were coming? - I just couldn't stay another minute down there in the city with you up here in this godforsaken country. (mellow music) - You know why I stay here. - But you promised that when I became established in my profession you'd marry me. - Yes, I know. - Well, now I'm assistant district attorney. You can't stall me this time. - Oh, I am proud of you Charles, but I haven't accomplished what I set out to do. - You're wasting your time. - Charles, I'm going to fight for these people until the state realizes that child marriage must be stopped. - Who brought her here? - I did. She's all right; she wants to go the route. - What's the idea, try to pull any fast stuff on me. - I'm not. If you don't think so, watch her go for the reefers. (mellow music) - Oh, thank you. (mellow music) - [Ned] The second category we call Antisocial Behavior which generally means elicit substances abuse. (mellow music) - Ooh, they're strong, aren't they? - Oh, a little. - And everybody pays for them too, don't they? - Yes. - People of my generation and Dan's generation that saw marijuana films when we were in our teens, boy, that's why we were never marijuana users. To a large extent, these pictures may have been corny and they may have been high camp by today's standards. But that is, I think that the fact that people of our generation always thought that if you smoked a marijuana joint, the next thing you were gonna do would be sticking a needle in your arm because that's what these pictures told us. - At the end, all of them got big dark eyes, circles under their eyes. - Or they wind up in an opium den. - And they're dying. (Dave laughs) So, it was nothing but an education. (Dave laughs) And every time I hear about somebody smoking marijuana, it scares me, it really does. - [Ned] Promiscuous Behavior describes the third category and the youngsters always learn their wild behavior from the adults. - Okay, folks, the party's on. - What happened, did he walk out on her? - [Woman] No, he walked in on her. - [Man] Uh-oh. - And they say Marion's a block of the old chip. - Thank goodness I don't have to worry about my Beth. She's a model youngster. (teenagers chattering) - [Man] You lost, Beth, off with one more piece. (group clamoring) - [Man] It won't be long now. (train chugging) - [Ned] Our last category is Sexual Ignorance. What you don't know can't hurt you or gee willikers, maybe it can. (train wheels clacking) - I wish we'd waited over a day and driven home with the Gordons. - We've been all through that. I have to get home today for business reasons. Besides, we promised Joan she could go to the school dance tonight. - I wonder whether we're wise in letting her attend dances. I think she's entirely too young. - [Father] There's nothing wrong in that. - I suppose you think there's nothing wrong in letting her see things like that. - Like what? - Like that. - Hey, Pop, have a little shot of bourbon? - No, thank you. (train wheels clacking) - How about you, baby? - Thanks, I'd love it. - Seeing them isn't gonna hurt her any. - You know you're awfully far away. Why don't you be more sociable and come on over here? - Suits me. (train wheels clacking) - Pour another little drink. - What are we waiting for? - [Man] Okay. - I could stand a little drink myself. - Dan Blake, how can you look at things like that without being shocked? (dramatic music) - [Ned] Titles were extremely important to these showmen. Having little or nothing to sell the pictures, they sold the titles. Usually the tamer the picture, the more sensational the title and if a title in some communities was too risque, they had a second more acceptable title ready to replace it. (dramatic music) Many pictures were also shot with alternate scenes to meet the moral standards of conservative communities. The tame version would add clothing and remove suggestive dialogue. - Well, then you should've heard him beat. - Oh, I always get frightened when they get angry. - [Ned] Watch what happens between the pillow throwing and the phone ringing in the two versions. (phone rings) - Nevermind, I'll get it. Hello? - [Ned] Note the additional dialogue in the daring version. - (indistinct) commit murder. - You know, sometimes they even try it. - Well, anyway, there we were. So finally, I said to him, "Look, what do you want for $10?" And before I could do a thing about it, he laid a 20 right in my lap. - With his hand still on it, no doubt. - Now look, honey, live and let live is my motto. Besides he wasn't such a bad guy once you got to know him. - But if he wasn't a gentleman, when did you say no? - Who said no? (laughs) The wolf I was with last night was certainly no Galahad, oh no. - How would you know? - I was there, I was there. (phone rings) - [Ned] Of course today even the daring version would probably be rated G. - Hello? - Wait a minute, it's the appointment desk for your date tonight. - Let's have it. This is Rita, shoot. Where'd you say to meet him? 616, The Pickwick Arms, 7:30 tonight. What'd you say his name was? Ralph Singer and he likes... What did you say his name was? That's what I thought you said. Ralph Singer, the big palooka, you bet I'll be there. (receiver clatters) Oh, how do you like that? I'll murder him, that's what I'll do. - What's eating you? - The first night he's home in six months and does he ask me to go out? Well, does he? - No? - No, no is right. Instead he calls an escort girl for a date. - Well, so a guy's a guy and a date's a date. Who is he? - Who is he? Who do you think he is? He's my husband. (somber music) - [Ned] Respectability was not the only reason for a picture to have multiple titles and scenes. Obviously this title was added later, it was a matter of economics. - That was part of road showing was that you changed the title ever. You couldn't afford to make a new picture every three months but you could afford a new main title. And nobody knew that. Again, I say I never had anybody ask for their money back. - No, I'd have it to them. (laughing) My dad made a picture, Maniac, and it didn't do any business and so we just put a title on the front of it and called it Sex Maniac and we killed 'em. It was a big, big moneymaker. - Is that the one where you pop the eye out of that cat? - No, I didn't do it, I (stammers) (Dave laughing) - [Dave] You had to find a one-eyed cat though. - [Dan] Yeah, we had to find a one eyed cat. - [Dave] You were only a kid. - [Dan] They put a marble in the cat's eye and they popped a marble out of the cat's eye and the people seen that. And they really actually thought that somebody popped the cat's eye out. - [Dave] Where'd you find a one-eyed cat? - [Dan] But I was about 15 when that picture was made. - [Dave] Yeah, but you were the one that went out and found a one-eyed cat. - [Dan] Well, I thought I was with the guy anyway. - Why? It's nothin' like an oyster or a grape. (laughs maniacally) But the gleam is gone (laughs maniacally) - [Ned] While these pictures always had some moral message to convey to the audience, it wasn't the message that brought the people and their money into the theaters. Any opportunity to get skin into the action was vital to the lifeblood of these showmen. And sometimes the method was blatantly obvious. If the gown didn't fall off the shoulder, the actor had to help it along. (sensual music) (applause) (man laughing) - Well, you're not leaving the camp so soon, are you? - Why no, what makes you think that? - You've got your clothes on. Hurry up and take them off. It isn't nice to keep me waiting for breakfast, is it? - I didn't understand. You haven't got the time on you? - Well, hardly, but I'll go and find out if you want me to. (dramatic music) - Oh boy, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is a real count after all. - The Sonny family, Friedman, Esper, Kendis, Foy. These are some of the names that put the X in exploitation. But when it came to selling these illicit pictures, they all acknowledged one as The King. His name was Kroger Babb and he invented or employed every gimmick and trick in the business to draw attention to his shows. - (laughing) Well, Kroger had a marvelous sense of humor, no question about it. And he was fun to be with. And as soon as he entered a room, things lightened up because his presence was felt very very acutely. He was a personality that you'd never forget. - When it came down to basic communication with the great American masses, Kroger Babb was the absolute master of this art. It wasn't a matter of talking to dilatants or sophisticates or pseudo sophisticates, it was just talking to our fellow citizens out there in a language they could understand. And Krog had this down to a science. And wherever he went, whatever he said, whatever he wrote, they listened, they read and they responded. And that was Kroger Babb. - It was wonderful (laughs) Never a dull moment and he was very easy to get along with. I don't recall Kroger ever in all the years we were married, ever telling me you can't do that, never. He never told me that I couldn't do any certain thing. And of course, Kroger thought money was to spend and I had a different feeling about it. And it's a good thing I did because otherwise I'd probably be on welfare today because he could not keep a dollar. - I would say by 1956, when I became associated with Modern Film Distributors in Chicago, Kroger was one of the partners in this firm and then two years later we bought him out. At that point between film rental and book sales on this little picture that had cost him $44,000 to make in 1944, he had grossed, had come into, through his hands somewhere over $90 million. - We had to argue with them to raise their price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Believe me, in some places it was a stormy session. They didn't wanna charge 50 cents 'cause they said people wouldn't come at 50 cents. If people had come, if the grosses at five, six and seven dollars were added up, I would say that the grosses on Mom and Dad probably would equal or exceed any picture that's showing today. (bell rings) (train whistles) - Most all of us that were ever in the road show business came out of small towns. Kroger came out of Wilmington, Ohio, Dan came out of Centralia, Washington. Dwayne Esper came out of some little town in Missouri. Yeah, basically we were a bunch of country boys, is what it was. This is your life Dave Friedman (laughs) - And you've never been in a big city? - No. - Say you've got something to look forward to. I love it. The hurrying crowds all going places. It makes you feel like you were really in the stream of life, really doing big things. Why you can just feel the throb of the metropolis. - I quit road showin' in 1941. - Yeah, but you didn't have an attraction like Mom and Dad with those books. - No, no, no. You guys were big. You guys were big. - So how come you got all the money? - Yeah, I don't know. (Dave laughs) - The subjects might've been different but the structure of these movies was basically the same. (dramatic music) Most exploitation films would begin with a written prologue spelling out the subject for the audience. Then early on the evil element would be introduced. It might be a backward tradition, drug use or simply a man eyeing an innocent girl. - Come on, give me one. - I haven't got anymore. They're all gone. You know, those things cost money and you don't give me enough. - Well, I'll get some more money for you tomorrow. - Well, I haven't got any more reefers. Would you like something stronger? - What kind of a kick does it have? - See what you think. - You've got purple hair. - Let's go dancing. Let's go, come on (tires screeching) - Oh Ricky, look out, there's a car coming. - Watch me give him a shave. (woman screams) (metal grinding) (lively music) - Say, Tommy, who's the little blonde over there in the green dress? - You mean the one dancing with Alan Curtis? - Who's Alan Curtis? - The one dancing with the girl in the green dress. - Yeah, yeah. - That's Dave Blake's kid sister, Joan. - Gee, she looks like Miss America to me. (lively music) - Hey, how do you like that? That's the one I was telling you about. - Very nice. (women chattering) - Back in a minute, honey. Hello, Marky, I'm awful jumpy today. Are you holding? (women chattering) I've been telling you, Marky, she's a nice kid. She's only working here 'cause she needs the dough. Marky, did you hear what I asked? - I've had my eye on that for a long time. - Layoff, Marky, she's the kind that works to help support a brother, wants him to have a decent education. - [Woman] And we have that also in size 12 through 14. It comes in the pink. - [Ned] Once we know the evil, the innocent must be exposed to it for the first time. (romantic music) - I'm sorry, honey. I just couldn't help it. - You shouldn't have done it. I've never been kissed like that before. - Yeah, well I feel honored. (romantic music) (water burbling) (scratching) - [Man] Jenny. (water burbling) Look what I brought ya. Now listen, Jenny, I'm going to be your husband (laughing) - [Woman] Tickle, tickle, tickle. - Well, the lady really is alive. Had me worried for a while. - Rita always gets fun out of things. - [Man] Don't you? - I guess maybe I'm too busy trying to make a living. I help send my brother to college. - Yeah, so I heard. What you need maybe is a little education yourself. Learn to relax. Let your hair down. You got a lot of class, charm. With a guy like me you might even go places. I know a lot of people. The right kind. You might even call me a sort of Santa Claus. I could turn your life into a nice, big, beautiful sleigh ride. Enough dough to put your brother through college twice. - You make living sound attractive. - Oh, here, try one of mine. Go ahead, it won't hurt you. (ominous music) - Here, have a drink. (laughing) - No, Marky, maybe for somebody else, but not for me. - Ah, what are you worried about? You're over 21. You got a mind of your own. I think you're the type that can take it or leave it. (dramatic music) - Hey, fellas, Anne's gonna join the club. Come on, we can't miss this. - [Man] That's a good girl. - Don't be a poor sport, Anne. It's fun;you'll love it. - Well, maybe one puff won't hurt me, Sure, you know I wouldn't steer you wrong. (dramatic music) - I thought you were a sport. (lively music) Course if you're afraid. (lively music) That's better;that's more like it. I know you'll like, really you will. Now just take a puff of that. (lively music) (laughing loudly) (romantic music) - Joan, I'm crazy about you. (romantic music) - I like you, too, Jack. - Ya know, you look mighty sharp in the moonlight. - Please don't, Jack. - Look, Joan, if you love me and you want me to care a lot for you, you've gotta put your faith and trust in me. When two people like us see each other for the first time we know, we know that we're in love. Well it takes couples, well they go together for years and they never realize how much they care for each other. Isn't that right? - Yes. (sweeping music) (somber music) - [Ned] The damage is done and the innocent trapped. Note the use of music for emphasis - Dear Joan, it was just a month ago today that I met you, yet the four weeks since I left seem more like four years, I... (ominous music) It was just a month ago today that I met you. A month? (ominous music) (indistinct) (ominous music) - Mom? - Yes, dear? - Do you have a book on hygiene that I could read? - What? - You know, a book about marriage and having babies and things like that. - Why Joan dear, such a question. You're not married yet. And I don't want you thinking about such things until you are. Whatever put that idea into your head? - Well, I... I heard some of the girls talking about having babies and, well, I've wondered because I don't know much about it. - Well, there'll be plenty of time for you to know all about it after you are married. In the meantime, I want you to walk away from any girls you hear talking about such things. - But mother. - Now run along, dear, and don't bother me. I'm late already. (ominous music) (sweeping music) (somber music) - I mustn't go to pieces, I mustn't. There must be some way out of this. - You've got to see him and tell him. - No I couldn't. - Why honey, when he knows he'll wanna do the right thing. He couldn't walk out on you now. You will see him? - Anne, I'll have to tell you, I can't marry you for awhile;I'm not free. - [Anne] Oh. - That's the only reason I suggested what I did. Go through with this honey. And then in a little while everything will be all right for us. Won't you trust me? - Oh Mary, give me a kiss, Mary. - [Mary] No, don't. Please let me go. - [Man] Oh Mary. - [Mary] No. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Go away. - [Man] Mary, you're (mumbles) Leave me alone. Oh, leave me alone. (Mary grunts) - [Man] Everything's over. - [Mary] Leave me be (screams) (man grunts) (Mary screaming) (gun fires) (ominous music) (scuffling) (gun fires) (ominous music) - Drake! (ominous music) (gun fires) (gasps) (gun fires repeatedly) (sirens blaring) (scuffling) (women screaming) (sirens blaring) (scuffling) (sirens blaring) (scuffling) (sirens blaring) (scuffling) - Come to many of these parties? - No, I've never been to one before. Aren't they exciting? - Yes. - [Man] Come on, Pat, come on. Let's go, come on. - [Ned] Entertainment was treated like a separate component of these pictures. There were pianos, jitterbug dancers and even nightclub acts. Party dancers were supposed to represent shocking behavior and immorality. And of course they gave the producers a chance to show some uncovered legs or skimpy clothes. But most of this entertainment was merely filler. Though it could be rather bizarre. (lively music) - Right this way, ladies and gentlemen, and see Fatima. (lively music) - Dance with me (laughs) (bouncy piano music) (singer scatting) - Boy, look at that girl go. - Mmm-hmm, is she hot. (sultry music) (applause) (lively music) (lively marching music) (castanets clacking) (lively music) (horn blows) - [Man] The wild bull of Poppa. (castanets clacking) (lively music) (crowd shouting and cheering) (somber music) (cymbal clangs) (applause) (mellow music) (symbol clangs) (applause) (drum roll) (applause) (mellow music) (mellow music) (mellow piano music) - Say, that's beautiful. (mellow piano music) Something I'd like to do my ballet to. - My new concerto. Get in the mood and start from the beginning. - Faster (breathing heavily) (rapid piano music) Play faster. (classical piano music) Play faster. (classical piano music) Stop that racket, stop it. ♪ So I'm sad and melancholy ♪ ♪ For I would rather be ♪ ♪ A bum on Broadway than an angel in the sky ♪ - I wish that fellow wouldn't be forever singing those corny songs. - Hey, corny or not, the acts were needed as filler. Let's get back to the story. The damage is done. Now it's time to find fault or place blame. - Mary Lou, I think I'm in trouble. - Joan, no. - Yes. (somber music) - Oh, David, I'm in trouble (sobs) - What? - What's wrong? - Well, Joan... Joan's in trouble. - You mean she's? - Yes. I've just had the shock of my life. Joan is, is in trouble. - Trouble? What sort of trouble? - Sexual trouble. (somber music) - How would you know about it? - You mean to tell me that you let your daughter go and visit Helen without even knowing where she lives? - Well, yes. She said she'd write in a few days. - But all we know about Helen is that she ran away to marry a man she had never seen. A man she met through a matrimonial agency advertisement. - Yes, I, I guess that is so. - Don't you know that some of those agencies are the worst kind of traps? That many of their customers are criminals, morons, white slavers, or people who are mentally or physically diseased? - No, I've never given it a thought. - Oh, you American mothers with your bridge parties and beauty shops and your silly flirtations. Wasting your lives and neglecting your duties, letting your children run wild for lack of sensible parental supervision. - Oh, you don't know American children. They're spoiled and disobedient and drunken. - Drunken, yes. Drunk with the exuberance of youth and sheer joy of living. There is nothing really wrong with the children of today. Nothing that proper environment and congenial home life wouldn't correct. - What do you expect us modern mothers to do? - Quit trying to be butterflies. Get back to the business of being mothers like your mother and your grandmother and generations of mothers before them. - I haven't been devoting enough time to just being a mother. - Oh, no Mother, it isn't your fault, it's mine. - Oh I've been so stupid. It's all my fault. I should have realized something was wrong. - Don't blame yourself, Joan. I should have told you. - Whatever Margie did last night or whatever caused her to do what she did, I'm sure it was my fault, not hers. - I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I always trusted Anne so. - But blindly I'm afraid, Mrs. Dixon, like too many mothers. Our boys and girls today need more than trust. They need the armor of knowledge, of intelligent sex instruction, to protect them. Thanks. - Who was the boy? I'll have him arrested. - They didn't tell me his name and I didn't ask, after all why blame the boy? - But you wouldn't blame such a scandalous thing on an innocent young girl like Joan? - No, I wouldn't blame her any more than I would the boy. - Well then who would you blame?? - I'd blame you Mrs. Blake. You and every parent who neglects the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth. Why were your children afraid to come to you in their trouble? Why did they have to come to me for advice? Remember this, Mrs. Blake, when your children have to go to someone else for advice, you've fallen down on your job. - What can we do, Carl? - Yes, what can we do? The whole town will know about this. I'll never be able to face the women of my club again. We'll be ruined. - Mrs. Blake, if I were you, I'd stop thinking about myself and give Joan some of the consideration a girl has a right to expect from her mother. (dramatic music) - Hold it. The theaters are no longer on Main Street and the team no longer travels with the picture. But back then, this was when the road showmen showed they were showmen. (somber music) (sweeping music) - Well, it's gone. It's been gone, I guess, 15 or 20 years now. And it's just about like maybe another 2000 theaters just like it in towns like this all over the United States. They've all now gone down to the malls on the edges of town with the big multi screens. But these were the theaters, these are the little theaters on Main Street where we used to road show. This was the kind of theater we'd be playing Mom and Dad in and on a typical day, say at seven o'clock in the evening, the theater would be full of women and teenage girls and there'd be a line of men and teenage boys stretched down to the end of the block waiting to get in. And right at a crucial point in the picture, a title would come on. And we'd say, we pause in our presentation to introduce the eminent hygiene commentator, Elliot Forbes. And Mr. Forbes would walk out on the stage and say thank you ladies for your warm reception. And today I am here to peel aside the veils of sexual ignorance that too long have overcrowded this fair city. - We sold this book, which was a sex manual. And we had two separate books one for women and one for men. And the authorization is given as or the author's name is given as M.A. Horn. And I wasn't married at the time and my name was Mildred Horn but Kroger said nobody will buy a book written by a woman on sex. Said, look, put down M.A. Horn and they won't know whether you're a man or a woman. - $1.00 a copy $2.00 for the set. Now think of it for less than the cost of a carton of cigarettes, every home in America can own a set of these vitally important books. And I believe with all my heart that a set of these books belongs on the living room desk or the bedside table of every home in America. For just one of these books can save a young man from the horror of venereal disease or a young woman from the shame of unwed motherhood. Then there's no telling how much they're worth. Through the efforts of the Women's Research Guild, these books are offered to you tonight at a fraction of their actual cost of printing and handling and distribution. My agents will now pass up and down the aisles amongst you. If you care to take home a set of these books, please do so. And I'd like to close, wishing you all a very long life, a very happy life, but above all a very healthy life. Thank you, good night, and God bless you. I mean, oh, it was, it was unbelievable. - God, Dave got up one night and his wife bought a book from him. (laughing) - [Ned] Finally, it comes time for the no longer innocent to pay for his or her misdeeds. After all, wrongdoers always get their due. - [Woman] I hope you'll be happy. - Well, I will I guess. - [Man] Good luck to you. (ominous music) - Laura, I'll be taking my wife home now. - Oh Mummy, I don't want to go. - Jenny, you're my wife now and it's time to go home. It's gettin' late. (somber music) Oh Mummy. (somber music) (clanking) - Your Honor, in this case the state waives trial of the defendant Ralph Wiley. It is convinced that he is hopelessly and incurably insane, a condition caused by the drug marijuana, to which he was addicted. It is recommended, Your Honor, that the defendant be placed at an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his natural life. - Oh but surely there must be something you can do. - I have done everything, but there's no use. We were too late, a clumsy unsanitary operation, aggravated by some terrific shock. - Oh, my baby (sobbing) - Daddy. Daddy. (somber music) - Hello, Mom. - Darling. (somber music) - Hello, Dad. - Hello, chicken. - Hey ya, Butch. - Hi. (somber music) - Thanks, God, for taking care of Little Butch. (somber music) (wild music) (glass shattering) (woman screams) (woman screams) (man screams) (glass shattering) (door creaking) (ominous music) (screams) (screams) - (screams) It's Daddy! (screams) (screams) (screams) (screams) (thudding) (woman screams) - Get it out of me (indistinct) - What was in that hypo? - Well we know what's in these pictures. Having shown us all this sin and wild behavior, the producers will now remind us, once more, who is responsible and how we can prevent it from happening again. - In many ways you parents are just as guilty as he is. Granted that they are. But will locking these youngsters up with habitual criminals make them better citizens? Look at them. Those two boys, do they look like hardened criminals? Is it necessary to serve the ends of justice by sending them up? And these two girls will prison make them better women? I don't think so. You know it won't. Give them a chance. Give them a chance to lead honest lives. Then perhaps I can feel, well I will feel, that my boy died for a very good cause. - Mr. District Attorney, I have a sister that I know will be glad to give Lily a home. If she wants it, would you like that, honey? - I would. - Oh, poor lamb. - And I'll see that our sons go to work on a farm to help with the crops. - And I'll go back to my folks in Michigan. - The solution lies more with the mothers and fathers than it does with the courts. I do all I can for them. Give me those notes. Citizens must become more deeply conscious of the importance of family life in our country. - Yes, that happened right here to your neighbors. It is not too much to say that in your hands lies the possibility of averting other tragedies like it. We must work untiringly so that our children are obliged to learn the truth, because it is only through knowledge that we can safely protect them. Failing this, the next tragedy may be that of your daughter or your son or yours or yours or yours. - And now friends you've seen the entire production. If you agree that these pictures have been bold and shocking enough that you've learned a very worthwhile lesson from them, I wish you'd show the management your appreciation at this time by your applause. - Do you know that every time we used to wear out a print there used to be a big barrel near our vaults with a lid on it. You know, that clamp on. And then we would wear out a lot of prints. We'd throw it in, in this big barrel. - Steel barrel. - Steel barrel, and just as soon as it would get full we would call the pickup company that would deal in this nitrate. They would pick it up and where do you think they would throw it? In the ocean. Everything years ago would go in the ocean. Did you know that? - Well, they would try to... - [Dan] Everything would go in the ocean. - They would try to reclaim the silver out of it but then they would throw it, you're right, they'd throw it. - Later on it they threw it in the ocean. - [Dave] Threw it in the ocean. - And then they stopped that ocean shit. - (laughs) Yeah, well the fish were dying. Wait, well maybe the fish we're looking at some of the pictures. (women giggling) - Why Joan Barry, you're naked. (woman giggling) - I fell in the lake, Ms. Frisbee. While my clothes were drying, they burned. - A likely story. - The exploiteers didn't always worry about the message in their films. Many films were made strictly to tantalize the audience. These titles generally produced during the 20s and the 30s sometimes had simple storylines but most often the subject matter was simply bare skin. Elysia was the name of an early nudist colony that became the subject of a Brian Foy film. Naturally it demonstrated the highly moral atmosphere of such a place. - Hello Mac. - Good morning, Doctor. - Son, you're going to be embarrassed. - I've got to confess that I am embarrassed. - You don't grasp my meaning. You're going to be embarrassed if you keep your clothes on. You'll continue to be embarrassed. Self-conscious and the entire purpose of your visit here will be lost. On the other hand, remove them, and in a very short space of time, you will feel like one of us. (bell ringing) There's the call for breakfast. (bell ringing) By the way, where's Miss Kent? Isn't she going to have breakfast with us? - There she is. - Wait a minute, come on son, your coffee will be getting cold. (group shouting) - But Doctor, where's Miss Kent? - Say, what's the matter with your eyes, son? There she is at the bat. - Strike one. (group yelling) - [Man] Come on, throw it home, come on. (group yelling) - I wonder who the new member is calling up. - He's probably calling his tailor to cancel his orders for a couple of suits (chuckles) - You have a perfect right to be proud of the things you've done, Doctor. - Thank you, well, I'll take the first bucket. Oh, Doctor, where's Miss Kent? - Here I am; that can's taken. (giggling) - [Man] Now was that nice? - No, but I couldn't resist it. - It was great but another bucket full would have drowned me. (Miss Kent giggles) - At this present moment no one can definitely forecast the future of nudism. All that we do know is that its growth has been tremendous and among respectable people. It is an idea that most people either accept very heartily and consider the greatest innovation of their lives or else they may reject it equally heartily and express contempt for not only the idea but for all it's four million adherents as well. Perhaps on both sides there is too much inclination to jump at a conclusion. Perhaps some who accept it at once are actuated by mere curiosity and look upon it as a new way of enjoying a surreptitious good time. But unfortunately those folks fail to realize that to enter a nudist group they themselves must be unclothed and that there is a mental examination as well as physical inspection coming to them. (mellow music) - [Ned] A New York court decision later brought forth a flood of nudist titles. But by then a more permissive atmosphere saw other types as well. Burlesque films were the easiest to produce but also the hardest to get into the theaters. After all, there was no moral message in the actions of the strippers. The big name in striptease movies was Tempest Storm. This attraction was produced by Dan Sonny and included a more evenly proportioned Lily Sincere who was best known for putting her clothes back on. (sensual music) Conservative communities and censorship, however, made all of the early skin movies, especially valuable to the road showmen. They called them square up reels. - These were, the square up reels, they were used only to keep the audience quiet if they hadn't seen anything in the main feature. To square them up, you square a beef, you make peace with them, you make them happy. That's what a square up reel was. And girls of Lola Lola and Hollywood Script Girl are perfect examples. These were all made in the late twenties very early thirties and were taken around by the road showmen. Half the time if there were no problems and in the main feature you could show the bare breast or maybe a bare behind you didn't even have to use it. (quirky music) (trumpets sounding) (sultry music) - Now that we've seen it all, are you surprised that these films, in fact, attracted large audiences? They filled an obvious need. I think these films are less interesting for the content than for the audiences who went to see them. And for the showmen who provided the motivation. With few exceptions, the movies were pretty awful. They were made to make money. Yet having met these showmen, their protestations to the contrary, we found that their hearts were greater than their wallets. I think their motivation was to razzle-dazzle in good old carnival fashion. The buck was a way of keeping score. - Let me tell you one thing about the... All my years of exploitation, and I think I can speak for Dan who has even spent more years in exploitation and road showing, we may have done some terrible, terrible things to the American public but I don't ever remember one soul ever asking for their money back. - Well, nobody ever asked me for their money back or I'd have gave it to them. (Dave laughs) - In a pig's eye you'd have given it to them. (quirky music)
