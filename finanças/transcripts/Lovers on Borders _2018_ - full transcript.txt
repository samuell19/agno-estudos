Sometimes I come here by myself. I hear there's a place beyond the sea, where we can be... whatever we want. What a horrible place we've been taken to. I hope we can make it back home someday. Faster, you animal! To the devil with you! How dare you speak to me like that! When His Excellency was away, you weren't so full of it! What's the meaning of this? Your Excellency, this slave refuses to work! Grab that bastard! Bring him to Senhor Gaspar. - Take down the bastard! - Pin his arms! Stop! Bring him to my house. Let's go! Senhor Gaspar has returned from India! - Thank God. - Welcome home, Senhor. Quit gabbing and lend a hand. Horrific... Lisbon has been devastated. What did the earthquake do to my house? Only a few walls shook. No wonder because your father built it. The main building wasn't even damaged. Look at those two Asians. Holy Mother of God, they have slanted eyes. Your Excellency, pardon me but... When will you visit your wife's grave? Later. Get that black slave. You are nothing... but my property. This is what happens when you make trouble. Never disobey me, or the same will happen to you. Not a word about this matter, understand? What the hell's going on? I told you to bury that piece of shit! If word gets out, we'll have big trouble! Get going now! Sir, please. A little moment of grace for our peer. All right, time to go. Hurry up, you swine! Your Excellency, you are not in India anymore. Hold your tongue. I won't have it any other way. Don't get soft on me. The slave's behavior was unforgivable. Show me respect or else. Understand? Who is that maid? That filthy wench? She's a farm girl, a new arrival. Her name is Mariana, Your Excellency. Lost her parents in the earthquake. She works for her food and a few centavos. Good morning. Soji wants us... to plant a camellia tree. We'll plant a second tree once we save enough money to be free and go back home. Our dead friend left these seeds. Thank you for mourning him. Why? Anyway, we're grateful. Thank you very much. You scum... Get to work, now! On your feet! Now! Eaten your delicious food? Now get to work before you shit it out! What do you want, Jap? Nothing, nothing. You're sadly mistaken... Thinking you can slack off with me? Respect your master, idiots! Stop! Get back to work... Now! Quickly! Get up! Quickly! See this? Look at how they draw us with these monstrous noses. This screen depicts the arrival of our missionaries in Japan almost 200 years ago. We were the first Christians to land on those islands. And who's this slanty-eyed creature? You... Come here. Greet our guest. In your customary way. How polite. Do you know that in Goa there is a community of Japs, descendants of the slaves who used to work in iron mills? They made the best slaves. But why do you have them? Wouldn't an Indian be cheaper? Because I hate Japs. I can never forgive what they did to my ancestor... Miguel de Carvalho. He went to Japan as a missionary and they burned him alive. When I found these two Japs, I thought an eye-for-an-eye... I'd just work them to death. Impressive. Is that jade from your country? Thank you. Look. I planted the seeds you gave me. It will become a camellia tree. A tree from your country. We will take good care of it... You and I. Maybe our lives... will get better some day. Waiting for you But waiting for what? I'm waiting for your shadow The shadow that I do not see I'm waiting for your shadow The shadow that I do not see In my despair You are so high as clouds go In my despair You are so high as clouds go... My, my... What a feast. All of you mucking about in this stinking mess. Please, carry on, I'm in a dancing mood. You only sing? Or you dance too? And you... You are keeping the beat with my work tools. With my damn work tools. For your amusement with these lowlifes? I'll give you something to sing about. Hey Jap... Your workshop is a mess, and you're playing drums? That's the way, Senhor! What a mess you've made. You filthy Jap! Disgusting. Trash. Maybe your buddy can put you out of your misery. Here. I can't do such a thing. Who will do it then? You? You? Please spare him, Your Excellency. Why won't you? It's not his fault. I beg of you! No. You Japs... From tomorrow, you will work with the slaves. That is your punishment. You are very friendly with the Jap. Don't go near the Japs ever again, understand? From now on, I forbid you from entering these quarters without my permission. As you wish, Senhor. Very good. I'm glad you realize your place in this house. Class hierarchy. That's the law. Understand? Eat each other's shit, you swine. Faster! Mariana! My life became a nightmare... The earthquake suddenly took my parents. It seemed like the end of the world. Dear God... How did You allow this? I was left with nothing. What a sad life... Isn't it? That is why... I decided to stop feeling. And yet here I am with you. That man is diabolical. People in town say he became uncontrollable after his wife had an affair with a younger man. If I am not careful... he will surely kill all of you. You and I... can't be together. You mean... our hearts together forever. What the hell? Trying to bring me shame? Stand up. Stand up. Your Excellency, please be careful! It ends here. Let's go. At last you're free. Someday, after I escape this godforsaken place, I'll come back for you. Will that day ever come? Yes, it will. Our fates... do not end here. One shot. Death travels fast. At the speed of gunpowder. He died away from home. Far from Mother and Father. Yes, death travels fast. You bitch... Serves you right... that God took you so young, took you so young... Aren't you fortunate that the earthquake swallowed everything around you? Justice. Justice... If you've got the courage, make me yours. Why is everything always... so dark around me? A bit of... light, please. All I ask is for some light, please. Is that too much to ask? I have never seen this room. Make yourself comfortable. It is yours now. But... Wear that dress. So beautiful! Show me. Stop. Turn around. Wait... Take that shabby thing off. Sit. Very well. What is this? You are more beautiful than she was. I am glad to hear that. Do not get complacent. That wall should look like new. Faster! You do not have to bother with that anymore. The other maids were busy. So what? Steward! Yes, Senhor? What can I do for you? Tell him. Please serve lunch. And do it fast. Yes, Senhor. Lunchtime. Keep working. Mariana... Understand you will be mine forever? I do. You will be the wife of a Carvalho. I will not take no for an answer. Yes. My love... words always arrive too early... or too late. I know. I know. Mariana! Where are you? We are late. Here I am! - Ready? - Yes. - A letter. - Why? Poorly written. I am not good with words. It is what I feel about you. About me? No, do not open it now. I am embarrassed. Read it after the wedding... when you are alone. My love... One more thing. What's this all about? The wedding will begin soon. Sometimes I come here by myself. There is a place beyond the sea, completely different from this land. A special place, where we can be whatever we want. If you say so. Gaspar... Do you truly love me? What? Truly? With all your heart? What has brought this on? I committed terrible acts against you. But I was wrong. I beg you, please forget it. I truly love you. I truly love you. With all my heart. I am glad to hear it. Mariana? MARIANA! This is my revenge. You took my love. It was everything to me. I want you to feel the same as I do. To lose everything you love. Everything. This is my revenge by love. This is my revenge by love. But I confess that I did learn how to love you. Step by step, I started to feel happiness, and came to love you. To love you. Thank you. Goodbye. Hey. Hey, man. We'll miss you. Got anything lined up? I'm going back to Brazil. Get in touch when you come home. My folks and Koshiro's are dead. Nobody's waiting for us. See ya. Be well. Already 10 years since the earthquake... this country is in deep shit. Yeah. Give me a cigarette. A cigarette? Yes. I promise to uproot them And blindly love you I am waiting for your shadow The shadow that I do not see I am waiting for your shadow The shadow that I do not see In my despair You are so high as clouds go Thanks as always, Julia. Japanese-Brazilians enjoy your fado. Why not come every night? I'd love to, but it'll cost you. Let's stick to once a week then. This place is right by the factory, so everyone comes. But I get to play every week, so I don't lose my skills. Yeah... I hope you get the loan for your guitar shop. Thanks to you, Yuichi. Then we'll really feel at home. There's no rush. What kind of business is the loan for? A specialty shop for Portuguese guitars. I see. You already have a down payment in place. It appears that you should be able to repay the loan. However, to be honest... your lack of permanent resident status could be a problem. We have no choice... but to consider all the factors. I want to live here for the rest of my life. For many, many years... Setting up this shop has been my dream. Marina, the parts you checked got returned as defective. You have to be more careful. Sorry. Something is wrong with my eyes. I'm seeing rings of light. The factory doctor says it's neurogenic, due to exhaustion and stress. Maybe you need to rest. ... the disappointing turnout of foreign visitors as the cause of the $300 billion deficit from last year's Tokyo Olympics. Police are maintaining high security against terrorist attacks. Last night, street protesters were arrested in front of the Diet under the new constitution's clause regulating conspiratorial activities... How'd it go? Well... They said it should be approved. Great! You've put up with so much for so long. My dream is about to come true. Marina... Thank you for everything. No, thank you. If not for Yuichi bringing me to Japan and getting me the factory job... we wouldn't be in this position. When things settle down, let's go to Portugal again. It's a bit expensive... but... it could be our long overdue honeymoon. Domingos will be so happy for us. My name is Shuji Kase, from the Strategy Division at our head office in Tokyo. I apologize for the short notice, but it's been decided this Engine Production Department will be reduced by five employees. Effective at the end of the month. Mr. Samuel Ando, Mr. Fabi Kawabata, Mr. George Sumida, Mr. Mario Tachibana... We need one more, and can offer preferential treatment such as a discharge allowance. Why from this group? It's not a singular issue. Your attitudes, tardiness, lack of team skills... It's obviously our nationality! This is an example of negative attitude. Or are you intending to quit? Son of a bitch! Fine. Mr. Yuichi Matsuda? You'll quit this month. Bullshit! I've got a kid in school! On your last day, we'll offer you money to facilitate your repatriation. A gesture of goodwill from the Strategy Division. - If you have questions, contact us. - "Gesture of goodwill"? Why are we outsiders in Brazil and Japan? Thank you for your service. I'll quit. - Wait a second. - Yes? I'll quit instead. Hold on. We don't mind, but are you sure? Yes. Okay. What the hell are you doing? - You'll get kicked out of Japan. - No worries. I'll get the loan, so I was gonna quit the factory anyway. Are you crazy? The review hasn't been finished yet. Without current employment, you can't possibly get a loan. Please. Whatever you say, the company's decision can't be overturned. Just let me continue working for a few months. I've told you clearly, it's impossible. I plan to open a Portuguese guitar shop. My dream is about to come true... This was your choice... And you have to take responsibility. Have a listen. The Portuguese guitar sounds beautiful. After all we've been through, he couldn't care less, that condescending jerk! Don't worry, I know you'll find another job. It's over. It's over! I fucked up the loan... I fucked up our lives. It's all my fault. What have I done? What have I done?! Calm down! Kase, that son of a bitch. He's destroyed everything... Kase... I'll tell Julia we can't perform tonight. I'm sorry. Why? I'm sorry. Because of me, you... Koshiro. Remember what I swore at that cape in Portugal? That I'd follow you wherever you go? Remember or not? You're gonna be late. - For Julia's? - You should go. I'm fine now. - I'm not. - Don't worry. I mean it. The time has come for our Friday night fado concert. Please enjoy the music together with your food. Sorry, but could you turn down the lights? Please. Good evening. Tonight we have two new guitarists, Yuichi and Pedro. Hope you like us. Koshiro? I'm home. Koshiro... Kase. Mr. Vice President. The President would like you to join the dinner tonight. Me? We've managed to cut our staff by 1,500 and 120 just at this factory. Considering your age, you've done an excellent job. Regarding the suicide incident, you're not responsible. He had many other choices. I'm sorry. There's some important work to take care of this evening. Okay. I'll tell the President. Take it easy. So close. We were so close. So close. If my eyes bother you When I'm in front of you If my eyes bother you When I'm in front of you I promise to uproot them... Hey. No one stops to listen. Except you. Can I talk to you? No. Call me crazy, you crazy You are crazier than anyone. Call me crazy, you crazy You are crazier than anyone. I'm crazy. But crazy for you. You are crazy. But crazy for whom? I'm crazy. But crazy for you. You are crazy. But crazy for whom? I've been waiting for you Take care of the top. That will fix the bottom. Like this? Very good. I've been waiting for you But waiting for what? I'm waiting for your shadow The shadow that I do not see... Japan? Japan. Me and you. Cool? Yes. Sure? Very sure. In my despair You are so high as clouds go Every day I wait for you Every day I miss you Every day I wait for you Every day I miss you Did you like Marina's singing? Yes. Isn't she great? Please come again. What's your name? Here you go. Thank you. He's from the factory? Never mind. Kase? Yes. Shuji Kase. It was found in the lake. The card of this restaurant was in the case, so the fisherman brought it here. Unfortunately... we need a new round of layoffs. We can agree not to shut down the department, but we need to cut costs. Can you please... find another way? Still thinking about the suicide? I told you it wasn't your fault. Oh no! - What happened? - There was a huge explosion. Was anyone inside? I can't think straight. Come quick! Over there! Come quick! Are you okay? He got fucked by the press machine! I told you to be careful. Stay still! Put pressure here. Find his fingers! Fingers! Hurry up! Make way. Kase. Kase! Mr. Vice President? What's going on? There's been a poisonous gas leak. Again? Will this affect our delivery schedule? Huh? I'm asking you if we're going to suffer a loss. I'll look into it right away. I'll tell public relations to get on it immediately. What an inconvenient time. You've been overworking us, motherfucker! Stop! This isn't the time! Are you okay? Investigating the cause? Are you blind? Calm down. I'll listen to your explanation later. What's done is done! We're short of numbers, so I'm counting on each one of you. In order to save the factory... We have to come together! Are you serious? Don't you get it? This was the fault of you management assholes. I'm not buying your sweet talk. What is it? I am sorry, Koshiro. You're okay now. You took everything from me. I wanted you to feel the same as I do... To lose everything you love. Everything. This is my revenge, by love. Goodbye. In spite of everything, I have to confess I did learn how to love you. Step by step, I started to feel happiness and I came to love you. Thank you. Goodbye. Koshiro Kido? Marina... I love you. Marina... I love you.
