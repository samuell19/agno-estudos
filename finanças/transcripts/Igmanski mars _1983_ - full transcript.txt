AG MARKET PRESENTS THE IGMAN MARCH Lets go. Zlatibor, late autumn 1941. The Užice Republic fell, the first free oasis, in the middle of enslaved Europe. Partisans are retreating from Serbia to face new battles. Čajka! Doctor. - Who? - I was talking to you. Čajka! Let's go, Čajka. - Let him... - Don't stab him. - What did I say? Where are you going? There is no one left. We are the last. How not. There is Kragujevac. Shumadija. Of course. But we move on. - Where to? - To Bosnia? - We protect the wounded! I'll stay here. Bran listen, you can't do anything in life alone. Yes, he knows that better than you. Where to? Get back in the column! A deserter! - Which army is this? - Colourfully made, they are ours. Stop! - Who are they? - Montenegrins. - Who's going? - From Kragujevac. Children. - Letter, is there anyone without a moustache? - Don't knock. Come on. - Who are you two? - Slovenian. - Handič, how did you manage to escape? - I did it. - To me and Adam. - Hello. Hello. You are handsome, Šumadinec, but without a moustache. I'll give you some. I wouldn't wear that shit under my nose, man. Čajka? - Where is Čajka? - The Spaniard will explain it to you. - Is he hurt? No, he stayed in Serbia. Spaniard! Something big is going to happen here tomorrow. We will assemble a brigade that will be talked about throughout the homeland. - Čajka did not understand this. - He'll be back. - He won't. - He wanted to die on his doorstep. - He'll be back, I know. - You are in love, but you see differently. - I know he will come. What is? What are you holding on to? Where did you get so many lice? Is this yours? We'll burn that and what you're wearing. - Where did you find the drainage pipe in Rude? - We have everything here. We're going to put up a plaque about it here. To the town of Rud, a warm bath was built by the Palelunska četa. Why are you laughing? Tell me honestly, why did you run away from home? I got an A in math. My father was waiting for me with such a belt. Then tell me, why didn't you pick up the medical supplies? - I saw this very professor in the assembly this morning. - Who? This one from mathematics. I heard that they ordered the moustache to be cut. As far as I know, Comrade Stalin also wears a moustache. When you come from cold to warm, the iron gets wet. It needs to be wiped clean, otherwise it rusts. - Did you wipe it? - We came here? Right to Bosnia. Can you give me a cigarette? Will you ever offer? On. Just sitting. I'm checking to see if you're all here. Yes we are, all of us from the first platoon. The other one is here next to us. Good. We're up early tomorrow to check equipment and weapons. - Are there any problems? - Tomorrow the first proletarian is formed into a brigade. We are in it too. Comrade Tito will find out review. - Just make sure we don't laugh. - Comrade Tito? Wake the sleeping calf? No, you don't have to. The person on duty should wake everyone up a little earlier so that we can prepare well. Brigade! Calm down! Greetings! Comrade Commander-in-Chief. The first proletarian shock brigade is drawn up. Comrades proletarians! - Death to fascism! - Freedom to the nation! Vacant on site! Here we are today, from the best sons of Serbia and Montenegro, hardened fighters, formed the first proletarian brigade. The fascists are still advancing towards Moscow and Leningrad. Here in Yugoslavia, together with Chetniks and Ustashi they incite a bloody, fratricidal war. They burn our towns and villages. They are killing innocent children. Therefore, the 1st proletarian brigade must be the punching fist of ours national liberation resistance. Fear and trembling of the enemy. It shows our determination that we don't want to live like before. Comrades, I especially put the struggle on your heart for the brotherhood and unity of all our nations. When you walk around our homeland, where it takes place fratricidal war, explain everywhere the great aims of ours national liberation struggles. Look, there are battles going on around us, your comrades are dying. We will have to leave a lot of blood and effort on this way. But the final victory must be ours! In the Battle of Gaučič, the brigade wins for the first time and on the same day set out on his triumphal march. Ustashas kill Serbs, Chetniks slaughter Muslims... One damn country. What will you do in Bosnia? Let him go. They published in Serbia and will continue to do so here. - Ooooohoo! Let the army go. - Eeeeeee. Which are? - I don't know. - Ustashi? - They didn't! - Chetniks? - No. - Are they burning? -They don't burn. - Are they fighting? - They are silent. Hey! The proletarians go! Who are you? - They call me Čajka. - What are you watching? - I polish mine. - Which ones? - The people of Kraguje. - There are no more of those now. Now they are called the 3rd Kraguje battalion, the first proletarian battalion. They are there, on the right, towards Zvezdana planina. - Why are they breaking up? - They are spreading the uprising. There, the commander-in-chief goes to the left towards Foča Jahorina. Where are you headed, you sick person? This is Bosnia, hey! On, another cap. Look, they also brought the Ustasha. They come from all sides. Offensive. - Who are you? - Čajka. Area of ​​Romania, mid-January 1942. The First Proletarian Brigade is under the attack of a new offensive. Columns of Germans and Ustaše are coming from all sides. There is a fraction of a second between the moment of the command: shoot and the shot and I react in this part. Like a bird that has wandered for a long time. And after a long wandering she found her way again. - What is? Are you shivering? - I come from the valley. - I caught up with you. - Go to sleep. Yours must have found another one. - Čajka will catch us. - It's a dream, Vera. They didn't. Trade. Heavily surrounded, the brigade, faced with treachery, is in front to the question: How from the ring? Where? He is the Supreme Commander ordered them to go towards Foča. Which way? Contact with command has been cut off. The brigade is facing a big test. The enemy is making a ring around us. We must go the way that is the only possible one. Prepare people for a long march in the cold. Lubricate your feet with tallow. Put paper under the socks. The task is bold and risky. We will pass by Sarajevo, after Sarajevo field. That means silence, no coughing or speaking. - And no cigarettes. Comrade Commander, the brigade is ready to march. - Where are you from bro? - From Bosnia. - What's your name? - Mustafa. - Where are you from? - From Kragujevac. Departure! - Where are you going, Bosnian? - See you, Šumadinec! Faster! - Why did you stop? - What's shining there? - Sarajevo. Lets go! - Are we really going to Sarajevo? - Silence. Of course we're going. Sarajevo. So they left for the train at nine? Maybe they are still in Romania. How nowhere? They have to be somewhere! He calls me every half hour! - Like the Chinese army. - Which one? Ours. Nothing can destroy us. Sarajevo is burning. I was here last year with Irena. Look at the mosque! And the church. Put out your cigarette, scumbag! Train! Keep calm! Let no one shoot! War is the stupidest thing in the world. - Calm that mare down! - Well, give it to you, if you can. It's too cold to go out today. Faster! The tree cracks. From the cold. Lets go! The trees are really cracking. That's what my father already told me, but I laughed at him. Now you too will have something to tell your grandchildren. This is already a real mania. The trees are cracking with the cold, Mr. Commander. What wouldn't. Here in the city it is -25, in Polje it is certainly -30. Only some Serbian refugees crossed the line. They went to get salt and flour. Otherwise, everything is calm here. I understand. Gang in Polje! Yes, Husa. There's a lot of them! Go to sleep well, we won't do anything to you. This is not a gang. This is the first proletarian shock brigade. Faster! There is a Franciscan monastery under the hill. Look, Gavrilo Princip. - Where? - Over there. He drew his gun. He's shooting! Revolt in Sarajevo, fire in Europe! Now foreigners think that devils walk under it. Where are you staring! Look ahead. - What is it? - Not again? Extinguish the candle. The devil take them. - What is this in front of us? - Igman! Shall we go over? - If necessary. - Do you understand now? - Just asking. Why did the convoy stop? What is it, doctor? What are we waiting for? A frozen dream. Give people a place to stay ASAP! Gane? - What are you talking about? -Where do you think we'll go now? Anywhere, let's just go as soon as possible. Departure! - Where? - Go up. - Up where? Why? We can't wait for morning here. Shall we go, Montenegrins? Let's go to Durmitor, falcons! - Ambush! - Why us? - Ambush, quick! Help the old man. Smiljan! How did Njegoš already say? Oh, you heroic nest, but bloody you our battlefield, many battles are still in your memory, you have saddened many mothers. Oh, if only the eyes could see that what is lost is found by Montenegro. Montenegrins, remember this well! Whoever starts will be the best; but whoever betrays him who started everything turns to stone for him. - Let him petrify the seed in the field. - He should petrify the children inside his wife. Let lepers be born from him. That the nation will point the finger at them. Above, under the sky is the soul. An eagle does not need only one flight. Djura Jakšič. Don't be afraid as long as your sister is with you. Faster! We will freeze. Is that you, Šumadinec? It's me, a Bosnian. Why are you so cold? I have a cold. Hold on, Šumadinec. Let's go, Mustafa. Hold on! Bosnian! Do you know where you are going? Where are you going! What a voice. How does time drag? - 300 metres as 300 days. Who am I... lrena. - Doctor. - You're hallucinating. - Maybe. - Gane! - Just a little. Let me see who's on the course. Get up! - Sarajevo! It's hot. - Jovica. Čiro! Get up! Spaniard, where are you?

Palelunci, don't betray me. Just a little while, and we'll be there. - How much more? - As much as needed. Just another hour of walking. Then dinner and sleep. - Believe me. - I wouldn't say. Get up! The horse can't stand it yet. The night between the 27th and 28th of January. The German command in Sarajevo is completely surprised. Only a trace of the column remained, which disappeared on the Igman. Badge! Wake up you fool! - What are you talking about! - I got scared. Where the hell next? - Where is the headquarters? - You are your own headquarters. - Where is the headquarters? - Don't brag, I'm sleeping. Look, the stars. They're teasing me. I hate them. Troop, behind me! - A break. - Who said break? Ulcer. Let's snooze for a minute until they come to an agreement. Jovica, Čiro, go back! Everyone back! - Village! - What kind of village? Can't you see that everything is falling apart? See that the windows are lit. - Where... is it burning? - What's shining? Where does it shine? - We're all going to die. - What are we waiting for? Let's go inside. Back! Proletarians! Communists! Battalion commanders, forward! Faith, Gane, Zare! Behind me! Above, under the sky is the soul. I caught up with you. Behind me. - Are you going or not? - Just go, I'll come after you. I know I have to, but I can't. You must, Gane. - If only Čajka was here. - I am. I know you are, even if you're not. - Come on, let's take a nap. - I can't, I'm in a hurry. - I have to catch up. Say hello to Zaret. - I will. Swim forward. Gane, stand up. I thought you were Čiro. You understand, we dream. It's only a few more steps to the top of the hill. Zare, Čajka greets you. Gane, come to your senses. Get up, Zare! The whole company fell. Come on! If we overcome this obstacle, the winter mansion will be ours. Come on! Let's sing, comrades! Look, Čiro. How plums bloom in orchards. - Don't stand still. - What is your doctor, I sing. - Just sing, just don't stand. - Am I dreaming? - You're not dreaming, just sing. I see the house. Look, over there. - I hear a cock. - I too. - I don't. - Village! - I'm coming, mum! The village dog. - I hear a dog. - There is no dog, wake up! - Silence! Damn cold! That's it! - This is what we dreamed of. - Look, Čajka! Through water, through hell... - Čajka! - What kind of mansion am I in, Irena? I just wanted to drinking tea in a white cup with three blue cherries. Commissioner, order the song! Our only mother, the working community! Show the way to those who do not know it. They're going. They dream, but they go. - Get up. Will you be able to? - I will. I'm strong enough. I have to. I have to bring everyone back to Kragujevac alive. It smells like bread! After hot wheat bread! Give yourself. He has to wake up. Spaniard. Behold, red chariots fly across the sky. The hike lasted 19 hours. On the same day, the brigade left for new ones positions, and 160 too cold farmers drive to Foča, the centre of the new free territory. - You will be one smoke. - Come on. Sit down, we're going for a ride. - What the hell is wrong with him. - Don't knock. - What did I say? Write. The first proletarian brigade. Position on Kalinovik. I express our recognition 1. proletarian to the National Liberation Strike Brigade, which is in time the German-Ustasha offensive in Bosnia made a great move and thus prevented the German plans. Those fighters of this brigade especially deserve praise... who suffered a lot and showed a lot in the process of self-denial and courage. To the Supreme Staff, Commander... - Does it hurt? - No. - Here? - No. I don't feel a single one. They are no longer mine. - Hello heroes of the Igman campaign! - Hello! - Čiro, where is the battalion? - In position at Kalinovik. They welcome you from all fronts. - Hello, Montenegrin! - Hello. I brought you something. - Hi, Badzo. - Hi, Čiro. - Where did you get that? Do you give one? Ladies. Are you... Here we have 40 of the worst cases. You said we'd be able to stand in three days! -Everything will be okay. How OK? Miljan, they took our weapons. Why? Aren't we fighters any more? I would switch with you in a heartbeat. To rest a little. You're lying. But we do not agree to lies and pity. We have to face the truth. We are a little crippled with frostbite, but we will get back on our feet. - Can I come in? - You can. - Tell. - Gangrene, my friend. Crazy! Lots of fingers. - What do you suggest? - They will have to be cut off. Do what you have to do. I'm a gynaecologist, I can't do this alone. There is no surgeon. - Teapot, comrade. - Let him call later. I ordered Doctor Španec to come, but to Žabljak has 200 wounded. - Courier from Herzegovina, comrade. - Let him in. Get in. Sit there, I'll be right there. I don't know that. I have nothing to do. Save these people, Relja. Each of them is precious. I understand. We arranged a ceremony for them, the likes of which Sinjajevina had never seen and Bjelasica from Turkish attacks. As soon as we heard about the murder... Peacefully. - How you have to chew all the time. - But if I'm nervous. - Is there a corso in Foča? - I don't know? I was constantly on the course in Kragujevac. But you are nowhere. Where did they always disappear from the basket? Stop it! - What the hell is wrong with him? - Don't knock. Get in. It is hard. Hold on. Love, Faith. Look at Bert and me. We didn't go through anything. Moscow, prisons, internment in Serbia, uprising... Igman. Faith! Be by his side. Is everything ready? These two are sick. What is it, you can't stand manure and stench? Shame! - Who is first. - Spaniard. Bring it. What are you waiting for? - Spaniard, turn your head. - I am Palelunec, Relja. Stanislav's mother! Nothing. Like cutting your nails. It doesn't hurt. - Who's coming with me? - I. I won't leave you alone any more. What kind of eyes do you have, Mirsada? - Which of you will be first. - I! Don't fantasise. Look down! Look at the reality. What do you see? I see... I also see what you don't. Fire! Let there be a song of horrors. Nah, cornbread. Here's a cigarette. - Thank you. - Take some more. - Does anyone like peas? - I. - On, Foca tobacco. - Thank you. - Tetanus is coming, my friend. - I sent a telegram to Moscow and courier to Sarajevo. It will be too late if the vaccine comes in a day or two? -I don't know. Nobody knows that. - Rejla, is it true? - It's not right, Bert. - Ančka? - Not good. - I'll come. Here is the continuation of the telegram from Moscow. Why was it necessary to establish a proletarian brigade? Why? - Ančka is not well. - Please? Ančka? Go. But why? There, across the Drina, it joins the Montenegrin-Kragujevska line battalion. - Mine? - And mine. - Tell us. - Comrade Tito is handing over the flag. - Do you see Per too? - He takes the flag and kisses it. - Tell me, Vera. - They are ours too! - Tell us next. Our commander kisses the flag. - Wake up... - Silence! We are listening. - Titija, Jova Keza are coming. - Don't lie! How can you see from here? - Really! They march and sing. The flag is flying. They are going on the train. - What is it? - Tetanus. Wait, Leo. Come on. Good evening. - Is there anything written on the water? - If you can read. It can seem to you that life is flowing, but it can also stand still. - He can't do both. - Not really. Gane! Do you remember when I came to Kragujevac? You taught me how to play football. Dream on... Damn, Gane. A gentle friend. We are coming to Kragujevac on white horses. Tetanus. We are completely helpless. Comrade Tito, what is the situation? Tell us. Heavy, comrades. We continue to fight on two fronts. Against the fascist occupier and his minions, the Chetniks and the Ustashas, ​​who commit mass crimes against innocent people. We must stop this fratricidal war as soon as possible. Did you hear about the victory of the Red Army before Moscow? This is the first defeat of the fascists since the beginning of the war. There will be more. This is just the beginning. Our allies, the USSR, Great Britain, America, will destroyed. Our task in this, however, is increasing. Soon the whole world realised that here, in Yugoslavia, only partisans we fight against the occupier. Comrade Stalin said to write a proclamation to everyone enslaved nations in Europe. He only told us that. Write it, Comrade Tito. We will write everything. - From Sarajevo. - Vaccine? Give it to them immediately. Give it to Ganet quickly. - It's too late. - It's not. Give it to him. Where did you go, Šumadinec? Spring of 1942. Foča has been free for 110 days. From here, the Supreme Headquarters commands the battles that flare up throughout Yugoslavia. - What do you have? - To the bone. - What? - To the bone. - I've never heard of that. - It's nothing like that. Bones snapped and break easily. But the real surgeon also came. A famous surgeon from Spain. Hello, comrades. Companion! Doctor! Have you experienced something like this in Spain? No, but something like that. Today and these days you have the opportunity to many v you surpass in many ways. And you can do it. Do you have funds for narcosis, ether, local anaesthesia? We have. Strong brandy. We will endure. Brandy. Will you be brandy? Believe in me, because I believe in you. No, they will not penetrate. - Shall we begin, Mile? - Well, market. Brandy, Spaniard! Just one more. - Long live the Communist Party of Yugoslavia! - Cheers! Come on, moan, man. Hold on! - What happened? - That hurts, damn it. Let's take a break. Turn it on. Will you be brandy? - This is already the fifth. - Now you've already started counting them. Cut him to give me peace. - Doctor, you only cuddle him, not me. - Let's go. - Can I start? - Yes, growl. Hey, slackers! How long do you plan to stay here? - Arise, simulants! - Hello. - Come in, what are you ashamed of? These are my Paleluns, the famous Igmans. These are young people from Foča. They completed our company. Only until you recover. Until you walk. You're in my company now, so we won't be separated. Departure! - Hello comrades! - Hello! Go, Vera. I'll catch up with you. Again. Come on, Mile. Just go, don't be afraid. Start walking. Early in the summer of 1942. There are already others, third, fourth, fifth proletarian brigade. - You know what's down there? - No, what? Igman. Nicholas! Look, Igman.
