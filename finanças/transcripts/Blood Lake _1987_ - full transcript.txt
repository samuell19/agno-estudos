Should've started dating you a long time ago. - Ha. Very funny. - This is close to the water. - This is cool. - Is that your dock? - Yeah, that yellow one right down there. - That'll work. - That's cool. - Let's go on in and get the air conditioning turned on. No kidding, let's go. Move it, move it, move it. - All right, bro. Where's the beer? - So what do y'all think? This is cool. - Thanks. - Hey, it'll work. The kitchen's in here, there's a living room in there and the bedrooms are upstairs. - Where's the bathroom? I kinda need it. - In there and to the right. - Hey, Tony, be sure you wipe the seat off before you sit down and take that piss. You sit to piss, not me. - Oh, I doubt it, Kim will vouch for me, right? - You wish, little Bryan. - Eeeewww. - Well, when you boys grow up to be men like I am, you don't worry about it. You just do the pretzel and your problem's over. - The what do you do? - Nevermind. - Oh. Yuck. - I just know this is going to be a very long three days. Why don't you guys go make yourself useful and unpack the car? - Anything you say, coach. Bryan, come on. Tony, give that thing a quick shake. - Man, is this a party house or what? - It's gonna be killer. - Hey, Mike, you gonna be a butthole this weekend or are you gonna let me drink? - A butthole? I don't care if you drink. Just don't go crazy on us. Don't tell Mom and Dad I let you. - No problem, I can handle that. - Famous last words. You been hanging around this pervert too long. - Nah, he's still pretty good now. But I'll get insane. - Yeah. Here you go, throw this in the fridge. - Sure thing, coach. What is all this stuff? This isn't ours. We didn't leave it in here, it would be spoiled. That's pretty weird. It's still good. - I know, that's what I mean. We haven't been out here since Memorial Weekend. If we would've left it here, it would've gone bad. I don't understand. - Just throw it all in the trash. Let's go for a walk. - I don't know. I just don't understand how it could've gotten here. - Hmmmm. Sure no one's been down? - I'm positive. - Okay, I'll go throw it out. - Mike! Mike! What're you doing? - I'm just checking this out. Oh, we don't have a key to that. - Oh, okay. - Hey, Becky, can we go out on the dock? - Oh, sure, why don't I go with you? - I'm gonna go in. - Okay. - Paddle boat! - Oh look, ducks! - Oh my God. Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Oh my God, don't touch it, Tony! - No, Tony, don't! You're such an asshole! You nearly scared us half to death. - That was great. - That was great, man. - I can't believe you fell for that. Goddamn it! I'm gonna kill you! Get over here! Let me tell you something. I owe you one and you better shut up or I'll owe you one. - That was great, coach. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you first! You second. You third and you fourth. - Now that you assholes are in the water, why don't you go and unload the boat? Yeah. Might as well. - Okay, here it comes. All right. Bryan, you drive this on over to the dock. All right. You wreck her old man's boat, you're dead. - Hey, relax, I got everything under control. - I am relaxed. You wreck, you die. Tony, keep an eye on him. He's pretty much out of it. - Yeah, I know. - Hey, screw both of you. - We'd be the best you've ever had, dickhead! - Yeah right, little man. - Listen to the mouth on this kid. Bryan, you gotta quit teaching him this shit. Even though he is right. Whatever. - Yeah. How's it hanging today, man? Whatever. What is he, def? - Let's tie this up, man. Get me a beer. - All right. Hey, here you go. Bud, all right. Woo, shit! - Well, I guess. Pretend it's your mama's tit and nurse it, boy. - I'll pretend it's your girlfriend. - Yeah, you wish. - I'll give her what you can't, guaranteed man. - Oh, Jesus, listen to him, man. What a mouth on this guy. - Oh shit, I should stop teaching him. He hazes you, man, you ought to. Check this out. - Beautiful. - Yeah. - Bryan, speaking of beautiful, I can't wait till tonight. - What's tonight? - I get to sleep with Susan. Oh, excuse me. Yeah, we're all gonna have fun tonight. - I'll tell you guys something, I'm gonna tear old Becca up. I guarantee it. - Aw, you wish. - She'll probably tear you up. How would you know, little man? Yeah, I'll find out tonight. I don't think so, little bro. - I can relate to that. I don't know. What do you mean? Susan's not gonna let you sleep with her. I'm your big brother, I'm supposed to watch out for you, remember? Check this dude out over here, man. I know, what's his deal? - He's ugly. Yo! Hey, man! Check him out, man. What's his deal? I don't know. Must not be able to talk or something. Hey, man! How's the fishing, man?! You got any fish?! Okay, let's go back to the house and see what the wives are doing, huh? Yeah, okay. - Wives, my ass. - So, how's your summer been? - Not bad. - Where have you been doing? Are y'all working? - Yeah, working. - A little bit, hanging out. - How long have y'all been down here? - About two days. - A couple days. - Have y'all seen the gardener around? - Not today. - Not today. Saw him around yesterday. Well, if you see him, tell him my dad needs to talk to him and have him call my dad. - Sure. - How's it going? - Pretty good. - What's up? - This is Dennis and Chuck and they're staying at Dennis' parent's house across the hill. I was wondering if they had seen the gardener. I haven't seen him. He's supposed to be around. - So what do you do for fun around here, Dennis? - Not much. Skiing, boating, fishing, partying. - Partying. - That's cool, we're gonna be skiing all day tomorrow if you guys wanna come with us. Yeah, why don't you come by about 11 o'clock in the morning. - Yeah, that sounds good. I'll talk to y'all later, I gotta get the phone. - Okay, bye. - You guys take it easy. It was nice meeting you guys. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - So, did you get the boat unloaded? - Yeah, yeah. - Where's my beer? - But why? Okay. Okay, yeah. All right, well talk to you later. Okay, bye. - What's going on? - That was my dad. He wants us to change the lock on the front door. - That's kinda weird, the lock? Don't worry about it, I can handle it. I'm an expert with locks. - Okay, thanks. Mike, something's going on down here and it's really bothering me. - Everything's okay, don't worry about it. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. - So have I, I'm just glad you came down. - Glad you invited me. Let me throw this on real quick. Okay, I'm gonna go outside. Okay. - I bet you guys didn't think we could cook. - Hell no. - I guess we gotta break down compliments, y'all. Got the job done, I guess. - Oh, is that a compliment? - Yeah, you don't know a compliment when you hear one? Girl's brains are fried, man. Oh, whatever. - Now for the best part of dinner, the beer. Can't ruin it. - That's your last one for the night, little man. Mom and Dad would kick my ass if they saw this. - Okay, that's cool. - Get that bag, Bryan. - I don't know if I should drink this, I've never had it before. - Think if you passed out I'd take advantage of you? - Yeah, he probably would. You have to watch out for the little pervert. - Yeah, I do. I heard a lot of bad things about you at school. - Them things are probably true. That's why you came down, isn't it? He sounds terrible just like you. - Terrible just like me? - Yes. - I don't know where he gets his shit. Oh yeah, I bet you don't. You're so innocent. - That's right. - I've been meaning to ask you, what is this? Oh. That's something my dad got a long time ago. - What does it do? Oh God, I can't believe it. - Always fall for that. - What an idiot. I can't believe you. - Want a hit, man? - Not me. You don't even think about it or I'll kill you. - I won't. I got me a beer, my sex partner, I'm fine. - I used to smoke that shit all the time but I just can't handle it anymore. It's way too bad. - Not me, man. It's perfect. - Not me. All right, man, I had this chick, we were both just wasted. - Yeah? - I was just getting ready to slam her, man, but she had to smoke a joint, right? So we did. I passed out right in the middle of this hour long foreplay session, my eyes crossed. I just couldn't maintain, man, I was out. It sucked, man. - Can't imagine. - Man, I see her around, I try to set it up again. Shit, she won't even talk to me. Won't even look at me. - You blew it. - Gotta grab it while you can. - Listen, to him, man, the sex expert. - No, shit. - God. - Hey. - Can I sit here? - Yeah. - We aren't disturbing you guys, are we? - Oh no, we're just going over a few old battle stories, that's all. - Battles surrendered to, right? - Yeah, something like that. - You guys are so weird. - Yeah. - So, Kim, Susan, do y'all ski? Yeah, pretty good. It's fun. - Well, I haven't but I'd like to try. It looks really fun. - We'll teach you tomorrow. - All right, thanks. - Looks like there's a lot of things she's gonna learn this weekend. - You wish, I'm not gonna do anything with you. - That's what they all say at first. - That's right, Tony, there's only two kinds of girls, those that do and those that will. Ah! What was that? - You all are terrible! - Well. - We know. - Don't look at me, really, it's this guy over here and all the other perverts-- - Right, it's probably you who got him started. - Well, someone had to do it, it might as well been me. - You are so gross. - Thanks for the compliment. - Oh, anytime. I can't believe you. - What's going on? - Nothing much. - Let's go to bed. Want to? Come on. - Yeah. - One at a time. Okay, let's go. Think I'm gonna get ready for bed as long as you promise not to attack me. - I promise but you promise. - I'll promise you anything you want. - I bet you will. - What the hell is that? - I don't know. Why don't you check it out now? You see anything? I don't see anything over here. Oh shit, I don't see anything over here. I wonder what it was. - Well, don't worry about it. It's probably just the wind. Ah. It's okay, don't worry about it. - Shit. - Son of a bitch! Shit! Get back inside! - What's going on? - I don't know. What was it? - I don't see anything. - You don't know what's going on? - Man, I just heard some noises, sounded like someone outside. Fuck it, man, just blow it off. Yeah, screw it, let's go to bed.

Grab the rope and let it slide through your hands until we get up to speed, okay? Woo! You got the rope? Yeah. Okay, put those skis on, we're gonna take the slack out. Just keep your feet straight.

You're welcome to stay. - Sure. - Susan, you wanna help me? - Sure. - Okay. - You ready to go skiing some more? - Yeah, hell yeah, I'm ready to go. - How about you? - Oh yeah, I'm a pro.

Pass it around! - I mean, look at y'all. - So what we gonna do now, guys? - I don't know, you tell us. Hey, I'm up for anything. - Hand me that glass. - What's up, what're you gonna do? - What's up with you? - I'm about to play some quarters. - Yeah! - I can't play quarters. I never do make it. - Well, that's good. Let's do it. - I'm not playing. - All right. - I can't do that. - I don't want any of that. - Hey man, pass it on down. - Keep that away from me. - You play often, man? - Screw you, man. - I'll blow your mind. - Oh God. What're you, a faggot or what? - You are just sick. - You wanna watch? - You are gross! - You wanna watch? - Oh man, y'all are terrible. - You guys ain't better. - That was good, that was good. - I'm not playing this. I'll lose if I do. - Get that thing back around here, I'll show-- - Who am I gonna pick on tonight? It's gotta be you, Becks. I hope you're thirsty because I'm gonna get you blown. - I'm thirsty anyways. - Have it, right there. It's all yours. - Not all of this. - Well, get half of it at least. - No! - What do you guys think? That's all right, there's gonna be plenty more of those. - Yeah! - Oh, that wasn't half-- - That's gross! - Ah. Okay, this time I'll let you get out of it. - No! Oh, that's disgusting. - Wait till tonight. He got lucky. - That was pretty luck. - How about you, Becky? - No! - Yes! - Y'all, why are you picking on me? - Because you have to catch up with us, man. - You gotta catch up with us. - I can't drink this much! - Finish it. - What if I don't? - Oh, what if she doesn't? - No way, man, I get to do it again! - It's what if you do. - Oh, really? - Let me get it, I'll get it. Give it a good try, Dennis. - Oh, that was close. - You get to do it again though. - Here goes a real throw. - Take it, Chuck. - This is what a crazy buddy ran up for. - Ah! - Oh, dang! - It's all yours, hun. - Why're you doing this to me? I cannot even drink this. - You know why. But I can't say. Come on, man, just drink. - Drink it up. - Relax. - All the way! - Yeah! - Oh. - Oh, yuck! No more. - Now give her-- - Take it easy on her, Mike. - All right, I'll make it easy on you, here. There it is. Just easy. Later on, it gets harder. I'm gonna pass. - Oh, you gonna chance it? - Yeah. - You gonna gonna chance it, bro? Oooh! - There you go. - Well I think his time beat me but oh God, that's just gross. - All right, Kim. - It's so close. - Wish someone would make me drink, I'm thirsty. You're thirsty? - Yes, I'm thirsty. - Just wait. - All right! Thanks! - Oh, man. - Oh, Becky. We forgot to tell you about today when you let us off. Man, why didn't you remind me? - Oh, I'm sorry man, I forgot. - Anyways, after lunch and you let us off, we were heading home and we saw this guy looking in windows and doors like he's trying to break in. We chased him off. - Well, what happened? - I don't know, we just saw him when we walked up and we just saw him looking in this window right out here, so we ran up and he took off. - Well, what did he look like? - I don't know, what did he look like? - I don't know, he was older. He must've been 40 years old. About 280 pounds, six foot tall. Uglier than hell. - Yeah. No shit, he was a real pizza face. - Pepperoni or combo deluxe? - Which way did he go? - He went around this corner and back off into the woods. - Shit, I wish I could catch this son of a bitch. I'd like to make him a little uglier. - Well, we tried. - No big deal, don't worry about it, man. He won't be back. - That's what I feel like doing now, just let it go. - Yeah, really. - Don't worry, everything's okay. - I'm tired, can we go to bed? - Yeah, let's go. Night. - Good night. - See y'all in the morning. - See y'all tomorrow. - Sure wish I could find this asshole. He's starting to piss me off. - I just don't understand it. - Chicken shit. - Yeah. - Hey, Dennis, you ready to take off? - Yeah, I'm about ready to go. I guess those catfish are heading for my lines. - You guys going fishing? - Yeah, wanna come? - Tomorrow, you guys gonna go tomorrow? - Yeah, we'll probably go tomorrow. All right, I'll go with you. - All right, plan on it. Okay. - Hey, thanks a lot for tonight, it was fun. - Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming by. Y'all be careful. - Okay, bye bye. - Take it easy, man, we'll see y'all in the morning. - Be careful. - All right, thanks a lot. - Bye bye, see you later. I just don't understand it. So what do you think, bro? - I don't know. Kinda weird. Oh, it's not big deal. Don't worry about it. - Yeah, I know. - So, Susan, were you safe last night? Was Tony a good boy? - Oh yeah, Tony's harmless. He's all words and no action. - Shit, you wanna see action, you ready to go to bed yet? - Yeah but I kinda got a headache. Becky, do you have any asprin? - Yeah, they're in the kitchen next to the sink. - I'm just kidding. - Goodnight, Susan. Goodnight. - Be careful. See you later, Tony. - See ya. - Night, y'all. - Poor Susan. - Oh, I know it. - Tell you what, do you wanna go outside and have a beer? - Sounds good, if you promise to keep the bugs off of me. - Promise. - Promise? - Okay? - Let's go. It's beautiful out here. Really, this is great. Look at all the stars, they're so clear. In the city, you can't see half as many as this. I know, it's so junky in the city. Pfft, really. Look at the full moon. It's almost a full moon too. It's so quiet. Mm-hmm. I wonder if Dennis and Chuck are catching anything. I don't know, usually fishing out here is real good at night. Those two guys probably won't have any luck. Man, did you hit on Becky or what? Oh, no shit, she is hot. No doubt. And the other two aren't bad looking either. I can deal with it. Really. You about ready to go to bed, gorgeous? I thought you'd never ask. Takes me awhile. I'm a shy kinda guy. Yeah, I bet you are. - Yeah, I am, trust me. Mm-hmm. Man, next time we come down here we need to bring some chicks with us. Yeah, that'd be great. Sure as hell wouldn't be out here fishing. No shit, we'd be diving. Muff diving! Really, man. Yeah, I can't wait to get back in town. I'm gonna nail the shit out of Cathy. Can't stand all this choice ass running around. - I hear you. Hey man, what's your deal, you son of a bitch? - Hey, man, we haven't got a problem with you. - What's your deal, man? - Say something! Come on, Chuck. Chuck! Chuck! - Help! Help! I'll get it. Thanks. - Yeah. I'm coming. Can I help you? Yes, I'm with the lake patrol. I need to ask you a couple questions. - Oh, okay. Becky, hang on a minute. What's going on? - Well apparently two young fellows were murdered. One of them was down here by the dock. I thought you might know him. - I hope not, let me go check. - I really appreciate your help. - Oh man, no problem. - Oh, I don't understand this kind of shit. Just happens sometimes. - Well that was Chuck. He was staying with Dennis. Where's Dennis?! - Is that him over there? - Oh no. Shit! That's Dennis. Him and Chuck were staying together. Becky probably has their last names up at the house. I don't know what it is. What happened?! - I don't know, I've never seen anything like this before. I mean, I just called the Sheriff on the two-way and he'll be here any minute. He'll probably wanna ask you some questions about it. - Just let me know, I'll be up at the house if you need anything. - Okay, thanks. Why? It's okay. - What's going on? - Oh, Tony. So what do you think? - I wanna go home. - Well, the officers want us to stay at least through tomorrow in case they had any more questions. - Mike, I'm scared. - I know. I'll make a deal with you. What? - I'll be your personal body guard and I won't let anybody get you. Okay? I guess. I wonder what they did last night. They apparently didn't sleep. Doesn't look like it. - Well, let's leave them alone, come on in here. Ain't you gonna go? - No, I was just gonna hang out. - What do you want for dinner? - I don't matter, hot dogs, burgers, whatever. - Okay, we'll see you later tonight. - All right. - So how was it last night? - Yeah, tell us. We saw you sleeping. - Listen to your voice. You sound warn out. - Suppose they stayed up and talked all night. - I wonder where Bryan and Kim are. - I don't know, Bryan? Bryan?
