Who is that woman? Why is she snooping around me? Her name is Mi-ryung. Who is Mi-ryung? I missed you. I've got the letter back. Did the Crown Prince... ...take part in treason? The Crown Prince... ...got stabbed outside the palace just now... ...and severly injured. What did you just say? You get out of here and hand this to my teacher. You won this time. I'm Park Dal-hyang from Gangwon-do. Is he dead? Why are you here right now, sir? I don't know. But he was at the game too. Park Dal-hyang. I'll remember that name. I'm sure you'll get me out. I'm your person now. You won't just leave me there to die. Your Highness. Why isn't he coming? It's been awhile now... Your Highness. Did you find out? Yes. Park Dal-hyang, Heo Seung-po, Ahn Min-seo. They're all arrested and being transported to the royal prison. They won't be able to get out without being punished. The Crown Prince is here now! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! It's better not to look. Don't worry about me. Please escort Her Highness out. Your Highness, please come back after when it's over... Endure it for just a bit more, we're almost done. - Your Highness! - Your Highness! - Please wake up! - Your Highness! Your Highness. Are you okay? This is why we asked you to leave. How's the Crown Prince? He's sleeping after the treatment. They said His Highness will be alright for now. The king came by. Minister Choi Myeong-gil, as well. They said you shouldn't get up yet. Please slow down. The royal doctor is reporting to His Majesty right now. He said he'll be better gradually once he's rested. Hand me a towel. The last wound wasn't even fully healed... Does he have a fever? Why are you looking at me like that? She's the Crown Princess. Show your respect and stay outside! Are you the Crown Princess? It's an honor to meet you. The woman who just walked out... ...is the royal nurse? Yes, Ma'am. Wait a second! Perhaps, are you Hyang-sun? Are you... ...Hyang-sun? How do you know me? I've heard about you. How dare... how dare you come here! You should live quietly after committing a sin. How can you just show up like this? I was worried that the Crown Prince was dead. Funny, right? I stabbed to kill him. But I couldn't leave because I was worried. Yes... ...I stabbed him with a knife. But he didn't seem to care if he dies... ...he didn't even move when got stabbed. He said he missed me... ...while bleeding with a knife still in him. I decided to forgive him for everything... ...just with those words. Even I didn't know I could forgive him that easily. My life is pathetic... ...but so is yours. You had someone you loved... ...but was forced to become a wife in title only. But still I am... ...jealous of your life. The world has weird sense of humor. Let go of me. I don't know what I might do. You heard about me, so you would know. I wasn't raised in a bubble like you. I can easily do things you can't even imagine. Because I was born so low. Hyang-sun is leaving for good now. I wish... ...you two happiness. Your Highness. You should get changed first. Your Highness. Is there anything... ...I know about you? Hey, Park Dal-hyang! Why are you so late? We're already making ourselves comfortable. Welcome. Master! You're here too? I'm just a slave. I follow where my masters go. Get in. Welcome to the club. Any man living in Hanyang should... ...get to try this jail-ring at least once... ...then the courtesans will treat like a real man. A jail-ring... After getting arrested, I didn't hear much for a month. My only source of the story was the people who came to visit. Based on the stories I'd heard, I can assume... What do you mean by help? The situation is urgent. So I'd like to directly ask you. Heo Seung-po, Ahn Min-seo and Park Dal-hyang are all arrested. Right now, you're the only one who can help the Crown Prince. What do you need my help with? Kim Tae-woong! Yes! - Lee Myung-baek! - Yes! - Jo Joo-hyun! - Yes! Wait. Who's that man? I don't have him on the list. Can you show me your face? Leave him alone. He's the lead monk from Hwasun temple. He came a long way to pray for the Crown Prince to get well. Show your respect to him. Yes. I'm sorry, Your Highness. Let's go. The Crown Princess helped Yong Gol-dae to escape. Meanwhile, Minister Choi Myeong-gil was... There are many suspicious things about Kim Ja-jeom! He couldn't even explain why he was at the gambling den. And why did he suddenly come rushing to Hanyang? Now that I see his motive behind this letter... ...is very suspicious. What is he really thinking? Your Majesty. Whether his letter is true or not... ...the longer Yong Gol-dae's case lingers... ...the more it will divide the government. More people will become loyal to the enemy... ...and betray you to save their lives. For now, we must resolve Yong Gol-dae's situation first. I wish I could, but there's no way now. We still haven't found him. He must be close to the border already. We've blocked all the roads, that's not possible. He'll be caught for sure, soon. What's important is that we must capture him alive... ...and reconcile with him. Reconcile? You're asking me to reconcile with that barbarian? You reconciling with Yong Gol-dae is the only way to keep the traitors working with him. The only way to keep ourselves undivided... ...is to reconcile with the enemy. I can't do that. I ordered his death in front of my people. I can't take back what I said. Your Majesty. People already know how much you care for them... ...when you ordered his death that day. The people are already on your side. Now it's time for you to be practical. Truly, it's what is best for the people. The people were touched by your order. But now they're afraid of having a war. Public sentiment is fickle... ...and will roar on fear. That's what public sentiment is. You can't withdraw your order. We need to be practical, not be hasty to judge. We must behead him! Stop it! I cancel my order to behead Yong Gol-dae. - Your Majesty! - Your Majesty! His Majesty finally withdraw his order to kill Yong Gol-dae. As if he was waiting for it... ...Yong Gol-dae was captured alive at an arranged location. It's Yong Gol-dae! Neither parties benefited from this incident. So both Joseon and Later Jin agreed to officially record as a mis-interpretation of the king's order. Yong Gol-dae took a step back and visited the castle. The king also took a step back writing a letter to new Emperor. Yong Gol-dae had a meeting with the Crown Prince... ...agreeing to work closely to avoid having a war. My intention was actually... Shut up with your excuses! Kim Ja-jeom lost his credibility with the king... ...and was demoted in rank. Well, this is based on my guess and not a proven fact. I hope you understand... ...since this writing to follow my life from my perspective. The things I remember vividly are... ...what I saw with my own eyes. For example, the Crown Princess visiting me in prison. Show your respect, she's the Crown Princess. Leave them. No need to wake them up. Give us some privacy. Why did you come to a place like this? You don't look so good. How's the Crown Prince? He's getting better. What a relief. I asked him to distance himself from you. So how are you in the middle of this again? Things just turned out like that. Now I think my destiny is with them. Ah, I found the letter. I burned it. So you don't need to worry. Who took the letter? That was... ...Kim Ja-jeom's spy. He was one-eyed, a very cruel man. He's long gone by now... ...so don't worry about it. Come closer. Are you smiling right now? I'm glad I'm in prison. When I write my memoirs later... ...I'll make sure to write about this. That the Crown Princess wiped my wound clean. Thank you. What? I came here to console you... ...but you've consoled me. No one ever thanks me for caring. I... I want you to be happy. I really mean that. Your Highness. Wake up! The Crown Princess is here. Your Highness. Why are you here? Why would you visit a place like this? I came here on behalf of the Crown Prince. Endure this just a bit longer. Where are we going now? Wait, wait. What is this? What's that? Come already! Wait, wait. Are we getting beaten? You'll know when you go inside. Wait, wait. This can't be right. They must talk about us up there. This can't be right. Talk about what? Is the Crown Prince not awake? He didn't mention anything about us? I don't know about that. Didn't hear anything. What are you doing? - Drag them here already! - Yes, sir! Hurry up if you don't want more beatings, ok? Come already! Damn it. Sir. Sir! Right-hand Guard, Heo Seung-po and Left-hand Guard, Ahn Min-seo... ...you've failed to protect the Crown Prince as his guards. You gambled away high amount of money... ...and brought dishonor to the military. You also broke into the house of the Commander-in-Chief... ...and searched without any evidence or a warrant. Each of you will get cudgeled 60 times! Whoa... 60 times? Is he crazy? For Park Dal-hyang, although his quality as a military officer is questionable, he hasn't been officially assigned yet, he has no liability in this affair. Also he confessed himself, he'll be cudgeled 20 times as there were extenuating circumstances. The servants Moo-do, Pan-soe, Pa-rang... ...simply followed the order of their masters. So the imprisonment for past one month is enough... ...and they are free to go. What is this? Why are we getting 60? They're trying to kill us. - Tie them down! - Yes, sir. Sir! Have you ever got cudgeled before? Does it hurt a lot? It's my first time too. I heard you can't walk for days. Crown Prince, you heartless jerk... I knew it. He must be sleeping... ...and we're doing this for that jerk. We'll start with Heo Seung-po. What? Why me first? Get started! Yes, sir! One! Sir! Does it hurt a lot? How much? Sir! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! The Crown Prince is here! Hold the punishment for a sec. Hold the punishment! I've heard about this late. They just followed my order. I'm going to ask my father to release them now. So hold off on the punishment for little bit. But, Your Highness... ...they are too obviously guilty for what they've done... Let me talk to the king first, then we can discuss further, so let's put it off for now. Yes, Your Highness. We'll stop this for now! Release them from the cross! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Wait. Hold on a second. So only I got punished? How about them? Can you walk? Support your master. How come only I got hit and things are over? I've already gotten hit 7 times. What's with that! Wait. It's not fair at all. What is this? Did you already get beated a lot? How unlucky of you... I tried my best be here as soon as I could. Are you kidding me? Get some rest and take care of yourself. I'll pay you a visit. Are you doing better now? Thank you for your hard work. I'll see you again. I tried not to get angry since you're still recovering. But still I can't calm my nerves. How can you act so stupidly? You're the heir to this throne and... ...you gambled during a critical situation? Aren't you afraid of the people's opinion? I'm sorry. I tried to control myself but... I didn't know the real of you. I feel stupid for trusting and relying on you. Do you know what I've had to go through? I freed Yong Gol-dae, when I should have beheaded myself. I greeted him, and even had to write a humiliating correspondence. I think you've done well doing such with Yong Gol-dae... Shut your mouth! You don't have the right to say that! You only pretend to care about me... care about the country only with your words! How could you fool me like that? Your Majesty. It's all my fault as his teacher. He's repented, he won't make the same mistake. Right, I deeply regret what I've done. I'll pay more attention to politics and study more. Now that I think about it... ...it's your fault you don't have an heir yet. I was worried thinking the Crown Princess is having trouble... ...having a baby but you were out every night gambling! It's not that... She still cares about you and went to the temple to pray! Don't you feel sorry for her? Think about that and start taking care of your family. How will you govern the country when you can't handle your family? You better not show your face... until you have news for a baby. Father. That's not possible with just effort... Yes, I'll try my best. Do your best! I'll be watching you. Yes, I will do my... ...best. Your Majesty. How about those in prison... I won't cudgel them. But they can't hang out with the Crown Prince anymore. I have to keep them apart... ...so they don't do stupid things again. Get me some ice. - Yes, sir. - I'm dying here. - And drinks too. - Yes, sir. And meat! Chicken! And the doctor! I need a treatment. My whole body hurts. Ok, sir. See you later. Stop fussing around. You weren't the only one imprisoned. Don't say that without getting hit. What the heck is this? Why just me? We were all there, but just me? I hate how those idiots in the department work. Just think of it as being lucky. What if he had come after you got hit 50 times? You're lucky he came after getting hit only 7 times. Yeah? Yeah, right. I guess I'm very lucky! Who are you? He's my inmate Park Dal-hyang... It's nice to meet you. I'm from Gangwon-do... Why are you bowing to her? It's my first time meeting your mother... She's not his mother, but his wife. Now that I see you laughing, you must be okay. This is so humiliating. Ugh, ridiculous! Sam-wol! Get the fire started! I've made a huge mistake to your wife... No, it's not a mistake. You're being honest. That's why I like you. I don't think you'll be welcomed here anymore. - Father. - Father. - Are you okay? - Are you okay? Okay, okay. I'm fine. You have kids? I didn't tell you? I'm the eldest son in my family. I had to suck it up, go into my wife's room every night until we had a son, so I have four kids. Aren't I amazing? I mean my patience... Yes. Father. - Do you want a massage? - Alright. Thank you my Bo-hee. I'm Sung-hee. You're Sung-hee? Not Bo-hee? When did you grow up this much? What a good father. I told you to go home often. Sir, you need to come out here. Do you think I can go right now? But you have to. What? Heo Seung-po, Ahn Min-seo and Park Dal-hyang. Come out and take the king's order! Come quickly! I'm coming. Here's the king's order. I won't punish Heo Seung-po, Ahn Min-seo, and Park Dal-hyang with cudgel. However, their punishment will be as follows. Heo Seung-po will be removed from his position as the right-hand guard of the Crown Prince and will be on probation for 100 days. That's good, I needed it. Thank you very, very much, Your Majesty! Ahn Min-seo will also be removed from his position as the left-hand guard of the Crown Prince and will be on probation for 100 days. Thank you, Your Majesty! Park Dal-hyang will immediately return back to the unit... ...and fulfil your duty. Thank you, Your Majes... You will report back to the envoy guard department. Yes, sir. I mean, report back right now. What? The envoy team is leaving Hanyang now. You'll leave now and escort them to the border. Right now? To the border? Right, now. But I just got released from the jail... I said the envoy team is leaving right now. If you don't run to Mohwagwan now... ...you'll lose them. Go now. Or you'll get imprisoned again. Take care! We'll rest... no, we'll repent here! Aw, poor sir. What are you doing here? - What? - You go where your master goes. You want me to go, as well? Your master is Park Dal-hyang, remember? Sir. Huh? Sir! How have you been, kid? What? You'll guard me with your skill? Shouldn't I be guarding you? What is he saying? Why do I feel like he's being condescending? When he should be thanking me for saving him... You should thank me for saving you, you prick! Did you get here? I thought you weren't coming. It was so sudden, I had to run. By the way, how come you are here? I have something for you from the Crown Prince. This is... ...his sword. Yes, he's giving it to you as a present. You cheeky boy. You swore your loyalty to me without my permission so I had no choice but to give you my token of promise. Use this sword only for justice. You're touched, right? I know, I'm awesome. Then... ...have a safe trip. Let's go! The Later Jin envoy team is leaving Hanyang today, and will arrive here in Anju in 15 days. So, for example the place they will be staying... ...we need more security to... Okay. You can take your time reviewing... Just take it. I'm sure you prepared it well. Do your best seeing them off to their home. Okay, then. What should I do with Yong Gol-dae? He's already working with the Crown Prince. It would be better if he were gone. If he comes here often... ...what can I do? I should've killed him when I had the chance. Now I'm out of options. Sir, I'm coming in. Sir, you should see who's out there. You! How have you been, sir? How dare you come back here? I'm glad to see you! I've ruined all my plans thanks to you. What are you doing? Get him! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Wait! I'm here to give you a gift. What? I know you're upset, but it's not my fault. It's all what Hyang-sun had planned. Is that so? Where is that witch? I'm here to send her back to you. I swore to myself after what's happened... ...I'll never work with a girl. Women are all the same. I am done with them! What are you saying? Where is she now? She's about to die. What? I thought it'd be best to give her to you... ...before she dies. Please take care of her in your own way. Your Highness. Where are you going? I have something to do... What is it? Did you forget that you're grounded? I know, but I should pay a visit to my guards. I'm here to check if you're with the Crown Princess. Please go inside. I'm old enough so you don't have to check up on my love life. I think it's better to stay low. His Majesty is very upset... Let's leave after midnight. I'll let them know you'll be late. Your Highness. You must head to the Crown Princess' room. He told me to check on that. I'm sorry. Let her know. Your Highness. The Crown Prince is here. I'm here. You've heard something? I heard that you can't leave here until we have a baby. Father's mad because of all the problems. I'm sorry it's affecting you too. Don't worry about it. I was on my way out, but Eunuch Kim stopped me. I'll stay for a bit. Would you like some? I'm good. I'm going to drink later. Then I'll drink. What are you doing? You can't even drink well. I thought it'd be better... ...since I don't normally do this. Don't normally do what? What are you doing? I'm carrying out the king's order, fulfiling my duty. I've met many women at the temple... ...in the same situation. They said I should act like a prostitute at night. Is this what they do? What... You're avoiding me now? I'm your wife. This isn't something to cry over. This just wasn't right for me. Men are caught off guard when wives act differently. Who told you to do this? Who would tell the Crown Princess to be a prostitute? Let's think of another way. That's your homework. You must have kissed her goodbye. How did you let her go when it hurt you so much? What are you talking about? While you were sick... ...Hyang-sun was here. Let's go to Yunsugwan outside of the castle. Hurry! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Let's go! She said she had to take a revenge on a man. But that guy was... ...the Crown Prince. It was Hyang-sun who stabbed the Crown Prince. But it's funny. After she stabbed him, she gave him your document. The Crown Prince told me to run away since you would strike back at us. I didn't understand then, but tried to leave. But you know what she did? She must leave here right now but she went back to the palace. Why? Maybe she felt sorry. How would I know a woman's heart? Well. What relationship did she have with him? It was strange. I did some digging. But... ...do you know who she is? I met with the wife of Minister Yoon too... ...and heard about everything... ...about you in the past. Then I was able to understand you. I understand what you meant by saying you hate woman. Mi-ryung, the daughter of Minister Yoon... ...wasn't the beauty like the rumors said. She was crippled and mentally challenged. Hyang-sun was her servant. She was the beauty, actually. Hyang-sun. Yes, Ma'am. Wash and change into this. Yes? But those are her clothes. Yoon's wife made Hyang-sun... ...act like her daughter... ...as she was ashamed of her real daughter. She didn't want people talk bad about them. Wow, your daughter is very beautiful. She's like an angel... Thank you. Why did you wait so long... ...to show off your pretty daughter? You hid for so long, a rumor spread that... ...your daughter was mentally ill. That was the start of misfortune. After a few outings... ...the rumor spread fast. What did you say? The Queen heard about your daughter. She'd like your daughter to be a candidate for Crown Princess. I should tell them the truth. Right. I can't lie anymore. But what should I do? People will laugh at me if they find out. I can't live in Hanyang anymore. Ma'am. Can't we just participate? What? There are many candidates... ...so I won't be selected. If we just pass that, no one needs to know. She wasn't an average girl. That's when she saw him for the first time. Maybe it was love at first sight. Well they were at that age, so it's understandable... Were you waiting for me? Your Highness. I'm here as I promised. I even climbed the wall. If you were to be selected as the Crown Princess... ...we won't have to meet this way. No one knew. About their relationship. So a mere servant had hope. She really wanted to be selected. Mr. Yoon, who was out of the city... ...found out everything later. I'm very happy to have you as an in-law. Why did you do this? What have you done? Do you know what's going to happen? Our slave will be the Crown Princess! I didn't know it would go this far. I didn't know she'd be selected... I'll take Mi-ryung tomorrow... ...tell the truth, and ask for forgiveness. Sir! We'll all be punished heavily. We should be prepared. No, that can't be! No! It's all my fault, you can't be... Master! How dare you barge in! Please have me as your Mi-ryung. What did you say? Everyone thinks I'm Mi-ryung. The Queen likes me... ...and the Crown Prince... ...said I'm the one for him... ...the Crown Prince said... he loves me. Madame. We can send her somewhere far away. That will solve everything, right? How dare you... You're not Mi-ryung, but a slave, Hyang-sun! How dare you forget your position and say such things? You abandoned your daughter anyway. You abandoned her because you're embarrassed of her! I'll be the Crown Princess! I was selected on my own merit! I deserve this. I'm Mi-ryung... ...who'll be the Crown Princess. How dare you speak that way? What did you just do? Did you... just push her down the well? That's what she's like. Hyang-sun... Where is she now? She was acting weird after she left the palace. She didn't answer when I asked where we should go. So we were going to cross the border. Then she got sick on the way there. Her obsession with him has not ended yet. She won't eat or drink. She's just ready to die like that. I think... ...I can understand you. And it breaks my heart. I want to console you too. But I'm not sure if I can. Because no matter how I try... ...there's no room for me. Can you do me a favor? On behalf of you, I escorted General Yong Gol-dae out. I think I deserve to ask you for a favor. Will you do me a favor? I'll decide after hearing it. Please... ...abandon me. It has been 5 years since I lived in this palace, but I've had no heir for you. I should've been kicked out of here long time ago. Even if you abandon me, no one will question you. I thought you were clever. But I guess you're an idiot. I thought you were only after money. You should've told me your plan. Then I could've helped you. Do you want to stay with the Crown Prince? Has that been... ...what's bothered you this entire time? What if I make you become a Crown Princess? I'll help you. So you can be the Crown Princess. I have to live like this for the rest of my life... ...but I don't think I can do that. I'm not qualified. Do you know... ...how women live... after their dethronement? I don't care anymore. I want to live... ...with a man who loves me... ...even if it's just one day... ...like a normal person and die. Please, abandon me. That's the favor I ask. I have a name too. I'll get my name back. I'll leave for awhile. I need your signature. What's wrong? Are you drunk? Sir. There's trouble. What is it? Find Seung-po and Min-seo. Sir! I have urgent tasks for them. Who's that man just died? It's the apprentice guard, Park Dal-hyang.
