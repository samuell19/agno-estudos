--== McEphie ==-- [upbeat guitar music playing] -[in Taglish] Let's go, guys! -[all laughing and cheering] [all laughing] [woman] This is mine! [woman] Wow, that's amazing! [all cheering] [water splashing] [screaming and laughing] [indistinct shouting and laughing] You can't catch me! Cheater! [laughing] [all laughing] Come and get it! -[in English] Here, guys! -Yay! [indistinct chatter] -[man on right] Cheers, guys! -[all] Cheers! [all laughing] [drunk singing in Tagalog] [man narrating in Taglish] In an age where everyone can call you a friend after clicking Like and a few hyperlinks, having genuine friendship is very important. Not the kind of friendship built through liking the same memes or following the same pages, [in Tagalog] but the kind of friendship forged and strengthened by real life. Friendship that has been tested by luck and misfortune. By good times and bad. By pain and by love. This is us. [in Taglish] I know it's cheesy, [in Tagalog] but yes, I love my squad. [all shouting and laughing] I just want to congratulate all of us, because we all graduated on time. [laughing] [in English] Cheers! -[in Taglish] Congrats, guys! -Really, guys! [in Tagalog] It's a surprise, Hadj finally graduated. [jokingly] Yes, why didn't you tell me? -[girl] You should have studied better. -[man] Congrats, Hadji. [girl in Taglish] Guys? You know that I love you, right? -[in Tagalog] Here we go. -[all laughing] Here we go! [in Taglish] We've been friends since freshmen year. I just wonder if we'll still be this close once the real world absorbs us. [in Tagalog] Why not? [in Taglish] I guess Ma-an's point is... [in Tagalog] we're all going to have our own lives. [in English] Career. Family. Will it ever be the same? [in Tagalog] What's that? [whooshing] [faint whooshing] [in Taglish] Is that a UFO? [in Tagalog] Meteor! [in Taglish] Darn, I didn't take a video. [in Tagalog] You know what that is? [in English] A sign. [in Taglish] A sign of what? A sign of our friendship. [in Tagalog] What Ma-an said, it doesn't have to happen to us. It's all up to us. [in English] Guys, real talk. [in Taglish] This has been one of the best days of my life. Even if I have to do this every day, as long as I'm with you guys, I'm all for it. But I know we're legit adults now. We'll have more responsibilities. Higher goals. And what's your point, Papa Kurt? My point, Junamae, is... I want us to make a pact. Let's make this a yearly squad tradition. No invitations. No reminders. [in English] Same place, same time, same date. [in Taglish] Every year, on the afternoon of April 26, let's show up here. [in English] Wait, wait. [in Taglish] What if we have other plans? [in English] Or work? [in Taglish] Guys, if you really want it, there's gotta be a way. [in Tagalog] How about those who can't make it? What will their punishment be? [in Taglish] I don't want punishment to be the motivation. [in Tagalog] We are going to show up because we want to... because we love each other, right? [in English] Carps? [in Taglish] Okay, okay. -[Ma-an] I'm in. -Sorry, my hand is wet, but okay! [Junamae] Count me in! -[in English] Push! -[laughing] -[all in English] Push! -Guys. [chuckles] [Ma-an in English] Guys, a favor? [in Taglish] Let's all be successful and change the world. -[Kurt] Yes, let's do that! -[Ma-an] Okay. [upbeat music playing] [metal clanks] [wind blowing] The online celebrity is here! How did you get here? The bus. You walked all the way from the highway? [in Tagalog] No, I flew. You should have hitched a lift with me. Why? [in Taglish] Did you offer? [in Tagalog] What are those? [in Taglish] Are we doing parlor games? [in Tagalog] We will pop the balloon of whoever shows up. What about those who can't make it? [in Taglish] They'll remain as balloons. A symbol of not honoring last year's pact. [in Tagalog] Since we're both here... [balloon pops] [in Taglish] So, how's work? Fine. [jazzy instrumental music playing] [man in English] Power morning! [all] Good morning, sir! Sir! Sir Ted, good morning! Ma-an. [in Taglish] I have a grievance to air. [in English] Can we talk? [in Taglish] Is Biboy downloading porn on his computer again? [in English] Yes, yes. [in Taglish] But that's not what my grievance is about. [in English] I feel undervalued in this company. [in Taglish] And it frustrates me that I haven't unleashed my full potential. [in Taglish] Well, we plan to change the logo of CommuTV. Maybe you can help us choose which one is more powerful. [Ma-an in Tagalog] Both look terrible to me. [in English] But that's not what I had in mind. [in Taglish] Sir, I know I'm just a PA here. [in English] But if you give me the opportunity to produce more interesting content for CommuTV, [in Taglish] I promise, we will revolutionize the industry. [coughs] [in English] Ma-an, we're... We are just a small cable company. And we have no plans of delving into content production. Or even, like you said, revolutionize the industry. -But, sir... -Ma-an! If you want things your way, start your own company. Until then, know your place. [in Taglish] So, what are you going to do now? [in Tagalog] I don't know. [in Taglish] You shouldn't quit if you have no other job offers yet. I can't work for a boss who has no vision. A baby boomer who has no drive to stand out. [sighs] If only I could start my own channel... [in Tagalog] Why can't you? Online. [in Taglish] I remember the videos you did for your production classes. Some were cringey, but in general they were okay. I want to. But I'm no longer a student. Mom doesn't give me an allowance anymore. I dated someone once. A model who was pretending to be straight. You know how he made money? Vlogging. Now he has tons of subscribers and followers. Like an influencer? [in English] Exactly. He started doing it for fun and attention, [in Taglish] but now brands are paying him to post about their products. He posted a photo while eating Happy Spaghetti-- while flexing his muscles, of course! He got 5,000 pesos! Not bad. [pop music playing] [humming along] ♪ Mm, yeah, mm, yeah, mm ♪ ♪ Whoo! ♪ ♪ Mm, mm ♪ ♪ Yeah, ah, oh-- ♪ [yelps] [in Tagalog] Ow! Stupid shit! Can't you see I'm dancing? It hurts. [sighs] [eerie music playing] [in English, voice echoing] Know your place! I know my place! [evil laugh] [exhales deeply] I know my place. [upbeat music playing] Hi, guys. [in Taglish] Today I'm going to teach how to make sautéed mung beans and pork rinds. Our ingredients are [in English] one cup of fried mung beans. Four cups of water. One tablespoon of vegetable oil. Hi, guys! This is Ma-an Miranda. Today I want to talk about the benefits of running. Number ten: It strengthens your lungs. [coughs] Number nine: It prevents high blood pressure. [coughs] Number... The word zoo is actually a shortcut for zoological garden or zoological park. But if you've seen Aladdin, there's another term, which is menagerie! Hi, guys. Today we're gonna react to a video called "Ex-Battalion Bboom Bboom Dance Cover." So, without further ado... One onion, sliced. Three cloves of garlic, minced. One large tomato, sliced. Number three: It relieves stress. That's right! When you run, you forget about the craziness of the world. Running is about moving forward. [in Taglish] Two cups of pork rind. [in English] One bunch of spinach. One table spoon of fish sauce. [in Taglish] For me, I think animals should run free in the wild. But they look sheltered here. So, I guess it's fine. [in English] What do you guys think? Comment below. [in Taglish] Viewers, let me know who thought about this. Bread with ice cream? [in English] What a concept. [in Taglish] The sweetness blends with-- [sighs] [in English] Eight-hundred-and-twenty-four subscribers. [computer chimes] [clears throat] [in Tagalog] Mom! You quit your job? Why didn't you tell me? So, what's your new job? [hesitates] Nothing. But I'm trying to be an influencer. What's that? Like a sales lady? How much do you earn? The payment method is different. I'll just explain it to you some other time. I'm going to sleep. Why don't you just find work here in Dagupan? People are fighting over jobs in Manila. You didn't even graduate with honors. What am I going to do there in the provinces? Pick fruit? [monkey chatters] [coos] Oh, no! It fell! Monkey! Can I take a picture with you? [woman in English] Of course. What's your name? Kathy. [crowd speaking in Tagalog] Me, too! -[woman in English] Thank you! -Thank you! [crowd in Tagalog] Can we also take a picture with you? [man] You're so pretty in person! We always watch your videos. Ma-an! Iggy. [woman in Taglish] Did you find a restroom, daddy? Oh, hi! [in English] By the way, this is my ex, Ma-an. -[in Taglish] Rachelle, my girlfriend. -Hi. I'll go ahead. [Iggy] Wait, I remember... [whispers in English] Fucking shit. [Iggy in Taglish] You're a vlogger now, right? That's why you're so familiar! I saw your reaction video on "Ex-Battalion Bboom Bboom Dance Cover." [in English] I like your insights. Very profound. -[in Tagalog] Really? -Yeah. How many subscribers do you have? I just started. So, just a few. [in Taglish] Maybe you have weak branding. [in English] Excuse me? You should definitely hang out with Rachelle one of these days, [in Taglish] so she can give you tips about vlogging. Right, babe? -Yes. -How many subscribers do you have again? [in English] Fifty-thousand. [in Taglish] Wait a minute. It's loading. Just wait for it. Stupid video. I still have to do subtitling work. Just play along. Here it is! Look! Look! Whoo! Let's go! [Ma-an] Fuck! That has 400,000 views? [Junamae in Tagalog] She has big boobs. Men will definitely watch this. [scoffs] Hadji, would you subscribe to her channel? Um... [in Taglish] Oh my God, you're a subscriber. Junamae, knock some sense into your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Anyway, I'm sure you're going to find your audience. Big boobs aren't your only selling point. That's right. So, what's my selling point? Your... Your calves. See? -Turn around. -Yes, show us. [Junamae] Turn around. They're so muscular. That's from all the running. Look at mine... You two bitches are messing with me. Why are you so affected? Is it because she's Iggy's girlfriend? [in English] Excuse me! [in Taglish] I'm just trying to figure out why she's more popular than me. I mean, not to be arrogant-- don't judge me on this, [in English] in fact, I believe women should start supporting each other in this patriarchal society-- [in Taglish] It's just that... [in English] I believe I'm better than her. [in Taglish] Right, guys? Yup! [in English] Agree! Hey, hey, hey! It's Ma-an Miranda. And today I want to talk about climate change and rising sea levels. [exhales deeply] [downbeat instrumental music playing] [in Taglish] Come on, guys! Let's dance! Whoo! Let's go, friends! Let's hit it! Yeah! [pop music playings] [in English] Hi, guys! [in Taglish] So, today we're going to eat watermelon with salt. Join me. Okay? Mm! [in English] I like grapes. [in Taglish] Let's see if I can catch it with my mouth. Come on, camel! Let's hit it! Hey. Hey! Come on, orangutan! Let's hit it! Yeah! Yeah! Come on, tiger! Let's hit it! -Whoo! -[growling] Mm! [laughs] [coughs] Delicious! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! [in English] Oh my God! [breathes heavily] [in Taglish] I have more subscribers now. I've surpassed Rachelle! [in English] Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Yes! [in Taglish] Yes! I'm prettier than you! You just have bigger boobs. But overall, I'm sexier. -[phone ringing] -[in English] Yes! -Hello? -[man over phone] Hello? Can I speak with Ma-an Miranda? Yes, speaking. I'm Louie Cortez. Brand manager of Busog-Na-Me instant noodles. I'd like to offer you a deal you cannot refuse. [Ma-an] Social media ambassador? Yes. We figured, instead of putting all our resources on traditional advertising, we'll put resources on social media as well by hiring influencers like you. You have 77,000 subscribers on BooTube, 400,000 followers on PlaceBook, and 500,000 on Pinstagram. My God. You are practically a celebrity! [in Taglish] I'm very honored that you see value in me. [in English] We'll pay you 2,500 pesos every time you post content featuring Busog-Na-Me. [in Taglish] It doesn't matter if it's a photo or video. But you can only post a max of two posts per week. [in English] So, if you post twice a week, you will earn... Twenty-thousand in one month? [in Taglish] Guys, I'm so hungry. Good thing I bought a pack of Busog-Na-Me instant noodles. Guys, this is so cheap. But it's so good. Especially the chicken flavor. So, here we are. While we're waiting for it to cook, let's hit it! Hey! [upbeat music playing] Guys, just order up! Hey, big shot! Sky's the limit? Easy! Don't get started. Remember, I was the first to push you to do vlogging. [in English] Thanks, friend. [in Taglish] Silver Itik Soy Sauce also got in touch with me. They want to get me as their ambassador. [cheering] Congrats! -Where's Papa Kurt, by the way? -He's going to drop by later. I'm just going to order our shots, okay? -Big time! -She's getting shots! [ballad playing over radio in Tagalog] [sighs sexily] [laughing sexily] [in English] Because you and your scent are one. [inhales deeply] [laughs] [cheering] [in Tagalog] Let's hit it! Come on, the steps are easy! Come on. This is so embarrassing. Your bestie has gone wild. Come here! Let's hit it! I don't know the steps! Okay, okay. Let's hit it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh my God. Do it! Before she starts pestering me... Just go. Come on, boys, join us-- -Sis? -[Ma-an sobs] Sis? [Ma-an sobs] What's wrong? [in English] I feel like shit. [in Tagalog] How come? I'm doing my best. But how come I always come off second best? That's how life is. Someone's always going to be better than us. -Hadj! -But it's true. [keeps sobbing] [door opens] Hey. [door closes] Sorry, I couldn't make it. The truth is, I'm still not done with my poster design. Um... [in Taglish] Congrats. I heard you're famous now. [in Tagalog] Maybe... you can plug my website next time. Okay. [in Taglish] But let's make a deal. Make me a banner. [in English] Deal. [chuckles] Um... I have beer in my fridge. Let's drink. Um... Sorry, Ma-an. But I have to finish my design. Just finish it here. You have your laptop, right? I didn't bring my charger. [sighs] Fine. Just hug me then. [sighs] Okay. [romantic music playing] [in English] Sorry. [panting] [in Taglish] Sorry, I really have to finish my work. [panting] [in Tagalog] Go to sleep. Let's chat tomorrow. [door opens] [door closes] Sorry, I was so busy. Kurt... [wind blowing] [in Tagalog] Did you ever lust over me? What kind of question is that? Ma-an... we're buddies. That night... it didn't feel right. Why? Because we're buddies. Then you should have told me. I thought it was clear to you when I left. [in Taglish] I thought you just needed to finish work. [man] Hello, hello, hello! [in Tagalog] You guys are early. Wait, why the long faces? You look like quarrelling lovers. [in Taglish] Don't tell me you're the next Hadji and Junamae. -Piss off. -[Ma-an clears throat] We're just talking about our careers. [in Tagalog] Whatever. Wait, what are these? [in Taglish] Whoever shows up, ergo, honors last year's pact, gets their corresponding balloon popped. [in Tagalog] Since you're here... What are you going to do? -[loud pop] -[screams] [Kurt chuckles] What was that? How are you, Denz? [downbeat guitar music playing] Fine. [alternative music playing] [indistinct chatter] [in Taglish] Moy, clean up table four. Table eight, check out. [in English] Hey, stop it! [in Tagalog] Don't fight here! I'll call the police! Roger! You've got lots of cash. Ready to settle down? Dad, your only child is gay, remember? Gay marriage is legal abroad. [in Taglish] I'm not yet ready for a permanent relationship. Not until I'm successful. My focus now is my business... And also myself. Or... you could find a partner and reach your dreams together. [in Tagalog] Aren't you sad being alone? Dad, who said that I was alone? -[water splashing] -[sexy electronic music playing] [phone ringing] Hello, luvseekerMNL? Where are you? -[man over phone] At the pool. -[in English] No way. -[in Tagalog] Yes, I'm here. -Me, too. [in Taglish] Look at the other end of the pool. Where are you going after this? No plans yet. Got any suggestions? [phone ringing] -Al? -[Al over phone] Hello? Can I see you tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yes. I'm busy tomorrow. Are you? Actually, I'm busy the whole year. [sexy electronic music continues] So, why "balonsabit92"? I was born in 1992. And "balonsabit"? Translate it in English. "balonsabit"... [in English] Well-hung? Ooh... [balonsabit in Tagalog] Let's go to CCP tomorrow. Virgin Lab Fest. [in Taglish] I'll be busy tomorrow. I'll just text you. [upbeat music playing] Bogart, don't forget the side mirrors and the mags. Also the exhaust. [car horn toots] [panting] [exhales deeply] [in Tagalog] Let's go to Bohol. What for? Vacation. I'm trying to save money. [laughs] I've got you covered. [scoffs] You don't have to spend on me. We're not in a relationship. This is just your hobby. What is? [in English] Sleeping around. [in Tagalog] Don't worry. [in English] I don't do this without protection. I'm clean. [in Tagalog] Denzel's place is jam-packed. [in English] On the house! -[in Taglish] You're the best, Denz! -Don't touch it yet. -I'm going to take a picture first. -Hurry up. Just a sec... Okay, go. Feature me on your channel. That's why I'm gathering material. Where's Kurt? He left already. He had something to do. Thank you, everyone. [in Taglish] We're open for jammers tonight. Whoever wants to showcase their talent, just go up on stage. All right! [in English] Let's welcome our first jammer for tonight. Why don't you introduce yourself and the song you're about to sing? [in Tagalog] He's kinda hot. -I'm sorry, I had a few bottles. -Not my type, you? [in English] My name is Wesley Gabay. And I'm going to sing "Sunshine" by Trisha Denise. [in Taglish] All right! Let's all give him a warm round of applause. Go! ♪ It has never been this way ♪ ♪ You always know what to say ♪ ♪ 'Cause there's sunshine After every rainfall ♪ ♪ Down but you stand up tall ♪ ♪ Set aside those worries and fears ♪ ♪ 'Cause you are better than people... ♪ [in English] Congrats! [in Tagalog] You were so good. [in Taglish] I sounded flat. I couldn't hear myself. Wow, humble-brag much? [in Tagalog] Where are your friends? They're gone. They have work in the morning. My name's Wesley, bro. Um, Denzel... bro. So, you're really a singer? Yes. [in English] I'm a vocal coach, among other things. [in Taglish] I'm also an usher in events. Part-time. Sometimes, I'm a mascot at children's parties. But lately, I've been teaching body combat in a fitness center. Whoa, so you're a multi-hyphenate. What's your drink? Just order up. [waiter in English] Yes, sir? [in Tagalog] Eman, one bucket of beer and one serving of sizzling pork. -Put it on my tab. -OK, sir. Are you a regular here? I guess. Actually... I own this place. [in English] Whoa! Bro, big time! [in Tagalog] Denz, we're going. Bye! You're such a pro, friend. Bro, we'll go ahead. [in English] Bye. [in Tagalog] Take care. Bro, one more? How will you go home? I can give you a ride. Don't worry. I'll take a Gruber. Besides, you're drunk. We could crash. I'm not yet drunk. Maybe you are. [giggles] [in Taglish] I super love lo-fi hip-hop. [lo-fi hip-hop music playing over speakers] [in English] You know what's a good idea? [in Taglish] Let me check you into a hotel. [in Tagalog] Just me or the two of us? It's up to you. Mm... I'd rather go home. It'd be cheaper. Um... I'm not that kind of guy, bro. [laughs] But... I like you. You're confusing me. [in Taglish] I don't like one-night stands. If that's what you're looking for, sorry... I'm out. What are you doing tomorrow? [all in English] One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! [water splashes] You know what, bro? We should do this more often. [in Tagalog] What? [in English] Swimming? No. Hanging out. [in Taglish] If I'm going to travel abroad, I'd rather go where people don't usually go. Vladivostok. Sri Lanka. Or Reykjavik. Where? Reykjavik. Capital of Iceland. [in English] Four! Three! Two! One! [applause] [in Tagalog] Do you dance? When no one's looking. What if it's just me? Depends on the prize. [laughs] [laughing out loud] [both laughing] [both panting] [dance music starts playing] Dance. I see you bopping your head whenever I play upbeat music. He's gonna dance! He's gonna dance! He's gonna dance! He's gonna dance! What's the prize? [chuckles] [in English] Secret. [dance music continues] [laughs] [in Tagalog] Where's my prize? Nothing. I was joking. I'm buying you salad next time. Just salad? [laughs] What do you want? [in English] Banana split? [chuckles] [in Tagalog] Are we official? Are we official? [Denzel] We haven't kissed. We haven't-- you know. [in Taglish] He won't do it unless we're official. -[in Tagalog] What a prude. -[giggles] You like his company, right? -[in English] Yes. -[in Taglish] Then why not say yes? Because he's afraid to commit. Afraid? I'm just not ready. And if we become a couple-- -No more Grandr. -No more ONS. You're going to be a housewife. You can now run for councilor. [laughs] [in English] Denz, what the fuck? [in Taglish] Get off your computer. What's your say? [in Tagalog] About what? About Wesley. Who's Wesley? Go back to your computer. Suit yourself! I need to go. I left my USB at home. [in English] Bye, guys. [in Taglish] Take care, Kurt. [in English] Bye, Paps. [in Taglish] But seriously, why don't you want to commit to Wesley? Obviously, I'm in love with him. [in Tagalog] There you go! [in Taglish] But he's not perfect. He's childish. He's messy. He even believes in the Illuminati. He's got stretch marks here, too. [in English] My point is, what if... What if there's someone better out there waiting for me. [Junamae in Tagalog] But, sis, [in English] nobody's ever perfect in a relationship. Not even you. [in Tagalog] What if he dislikes things about you, too? Like what? You're too horny. -[laughs] -Kidding! You were saying, Junamae? [in English] The goal is to make it work in spite of imperfections. [in Tagalog] Yeah. It's not only your partner who has the obligation to make your relationship couple goals. You do, too. [splashing] Why so sullen? The truth is, when I first met you, [in Taglish] I was only after a one-night stand. It wasn't my priority to be in a serious relationship. I still want to achieve a lot before I turn 30. [in English] And I was afraid... [in Taglish] that getting into a serious relationship would distract me from my goals. [in English] But... spending many days with you really changed my perspective. [in Taglish] I think I want to try a serious relationship... [in English] with you. [in Taglish] I'm flattered I changed your mind. [in English] Slightly. Bro, I have a question. Have you heard about open relationships? It's where two people are in a relationship, but they're allowed to date other people. Yes. That's what I want for us. You don't want a one-night stand, but you're okay with multiple partners? [in English] Multiple doesn't mean not serious. [in Taglish] But why do you want multiple partners? Am I not good enough? No one is good enough. [in English] Not even me. [in Taglish] I don't want to share. Hmm? I like you so much. I'm not sharing you with anyone. Either you're mine or not. [Wesley sighs] [in English] Please! [in Taglish] I can give you anything you want. You don't have to look elsewhere. Want to go to Iceland? Let's go. [in English] Just tell me what you want. [Wesley sighs] Non-exclusivity. I'll tell you later when we all get drunk. I don't want negativity. Just happy thoughts. [in English] Hey, hey, hey! Hi, guys! Hi! [in Taglish] I can't believe it. We're the last ones to arrive? Everyone's here. Guys, [in English] congrats. [balloons pop] [in Tagalog] What are the balloons for? -[Kurt] Oh, you're done? -[Denzel in English] Yes. [in Tagalog] Will you sulk all day? Why are we in separate tents? [in English] For the nth time, Hadj, [in Tagalog] this is squad time. I don't want us in our own world. They won't mind! [in Taglish] Last year, you were in my tent all night. [in Tagalog] Need help? Ask Hadj! Looks like he really does. He's being melodramatic. Um... Junamae seems pissed. How are you two? [sighs] Fine. [instrumental music playing] [Hadji] Every time I watch Jurassic Park, I fantasize about what life was like before. [chuckles] What's hard is, we were conditioned by Hollywood, along with early books, about what dinosaurs looked like. We've got it all wrong. [in Taglish] Dinosaurs had feathers. -[in English] Feathers? -[in Tagalog] Different colors. [in Tagalog] That's sad. Maybe it's their karma. Because all they do is hunt one another. It's 5:00 a.m. Already? I need to go back to my tent. This is crazy. The sun's out. Are you still going to sleep? Your coffee kept me up all night. Where are we? We might get lost. We just went straight from our campsite. I'll take care of you. Hadj... [eerie ambiance] Snake skin. Juns? Run! [giggling] -[grunts] -What was that? [laughs] Why didn't you run? What did you see? Dinosaur skin? [grunts] [in Taglish] You watch too many Hollywood films. [instrumental music playing] Let's go back. [music playing over phone] Juns. [in English] Yes? Junamae. [music stops] [in Taglish] Can we talk about what just happened? [in Tagalog] The truth is, for a long time-- No, no, no. [in Taglish] Hadj, we're just going to complicate it if we overthink it. Sooner or later, we're going to look for a label for our relationship. [in Tagalog] Et cetera. I don't want that. [in Taglish] That's so '90s. All I know is... I enjoy your company. And I assume you feel the same way. So, can we just go with the flow? Is that okay with you? [upbeat music playing] [in Tagalog] Hadj. What if I live here with you? [in Taglish] As in, live-in partners? As in, I can share the cost of the rent, water, and Internet with you. Done! [laughing] [both panting] -[in Taglish] That was the last one. -[in Tagalog] Good. So? Let's start unpacking? [in Taglish] Let's take a break. Juns, I kept away the-- The yellow's yours. Mine's orange. [in English] Catch! Juns! Hey, Juns! [in Taglish] Fetch me the dipper from the garden. Hold on. I can't get this in. [sniffling] [in Tagalog] Why are you crying? The film is so touching. They love each other so much. Watch this. Ew! [in Taglish] Let's have dinner? [in Tagalog] What's that? Liver stew and bitter gourd. I don't like it. I'll just order takeout. -I-- -He asked if he could date me. He was willing to give me 10,000 pesos. I told him, "Sir, I'm a promodizer, not a hooker." -What if he made a bigger offer? -How much? [in Taglish] Let's say 100,000. [in Tagalog] I'd still say no. He's too old. I'm sure his balls smell. [laughs] -[Denzel in Taglish] You cool with that? -Yes, I'm very cool with that setup. [Ma-an in Tagalog] What do you call each other? [in Taglish] We use our first names. It's because they're exclusive but not yet official. You're also not in an official relationship. -But you still call them names. -That's right. You call your flings honey, bunchie, sweetie, pearl shake... -Pearl shake? -That's not true. I never called anyone pearl shake. That's fake news! So, what do you call Wesley? I want to hear it. -[in English] Baby back ribs. -[laughter] [in Tagalog] What's going on? What's going on? Nothing! Why don't you join in sometimes? [in Taglish] Finally, the event's over! [in Tagalog] My jaw is about to give up from all that smiling. Drink this. Nobody's drinking it, anyway. Papa Kurt, it's a miracle you're here! It's a miracle! Um, I'm leaving in a few. What a buzzkill. Junamae, you can sit next to Hadji. I'm fine over here, sis. As I was saying, my boss caught one of the promodizers throwing the fliers away. That explains why her fliers run out so fast because she throws them away. Do you have work tomorrow? Do you want to go to the National Museum of Natural History? The new one. There's no entrance fee. What's in there? Nothing. The Philippines' flora and fauna. They have a replica of Lolong. Who's going to come with us? Just the two of us. I think I just want to chill at home. I've been up all night the past few days. But if you want to go, go ahead. Come on, we won't stay long. We're just going to take pictures, eat, and then we can go home afterwards. Why don't you ask Kurt out? He likes that kind of stuff, right? Never mind. I'm just going to write subtitles. [man in video in English] Princess, you make me want to be a better man. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you so much. Probably more than anybody could love another person. You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die. Will you marry me? I've fallen in love. I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people. You complete me. So yes, Pocholo! Yes! [people cheering] [in Taglish] Congratulations. [suspense music playing] -[sweet music] -[man 1 in English] I love you. -[man 2] I love you. -[woman 1] I love you. -[woman 2] I love you. -[man 2] I love you. I love you. -[man 2] I love you. -[man 3] I love you. [sweet piano music playing] [in Tagalog] What's all this? [in English] A very special dinner. For a very special lady. Who goes by the name Maria Junamae Sugcang Quiambao. [in Taglish] Is this steak? [in Tagalog] You're nuts, Hadj. How much was this? Don't think about it. [in English] A princess like you deserves only the finest things. [in Tagalog] I'm here to provide them for you because I love you. [laughing] Fuck you, Hadj. You're insane. My workmates and I already had dinner at Denzel's. You know what, just put the steak in the fridge. I don't want to waste it. And I'm exhausted. [in Taglish] Weren't you touched? Weren't you a bit surprised? You're so weird. [in Tagalog] I'm going to bed. [comical electronic guitar music playing] [in English] Sweet dreams? Huh? [in Tagalog] I said, [in English] sweet dreams? [in Taglish] But there's a question mark. I didn't mean it as a period, because then you might think I want to go to sleep. But no, there's a question mark. I have something else in mind. [in English] Which is? Sex. [sighs] Hadj, [in Taglish] I'm tired. Can we do it some other time? [in Tagalog] Besides... look at the mess you've made. I'm gonna go brush my teeth, and you better clean that up before I get back. [sad piano music playing] [sniffs] [music stops] [sighs] What are you watching? I envy them. Who? [sighs heavily] The couple in the movie. You know what? You watch too many romcoms. That's why you're like that. But they're wonderful. [in Taglish] They have unrealistic stories. Unrealistic characters. And unrealistic endings. It's okay to watch them for fun. But you're taking them way too seriously. [in Tagalog] Do you love me, Juns? [somber guitar music playing] Yes. Do you see your future with me? -Yes. -With kids? -Maybe. -Living in our own house? Maybe. What is this, a game show? Is it okay with you if we get married? Hadj... I like you... right now, but... what if you change after we get married? What if I change? How could we ever get out of it if we're already chained to each other? I envy couples I see on the Internet. They celebrate monthsaries. They travel abroad together. Others have joint accounts on PlaceBook. What about me? I can't even put our relationship status on PlaceBook because I don't know what we are. [in Taglish] Hear your demands? Those are the complications that come with labels. [in Tagalog] I told you before, I don't want to complicate it. I'm not going to be like your womanizing father. I'm not going to be a martyr like your mom who puts up with your irresponsible dad. Don't drag my parents into this. You started it! I'm done. I told you, I don't want drama. I'm going home. Juns. Juns! Juns! Juns, let's talk! Get out of my way. Juns, don't. I will kneel in front of you. Just don't leave me, Juns. Don't leave me. Which K-drama are you reenacting? Juns! I'm sorry! I won't do this again! Please don't leave me. I'll cut out all the drama, I swear! I promise! No more drama. If you don't want me to leave, calm down. Juns! One! Juns! Two! Okay, okay. Stop crying! [sobbing] [sweet music playing] [Junamae humming] [in English] Good morning, love! [in Tagalog] Perfect. [in English] I made breakfast. [in Tagalog] Sit down. I'm about to finish. Love, I booked us tickets to this newly-opened 3D art museum. Do you want to go? Junamae... [in English] I love you. I love you more. I love you most. [chuckles] [in Tagalog] Let's eat. [suspense music playing] Eat, my love. [screams] [panting] [in English] Morning. -[in Tagalog] Have you eaten breakfast? -I'm just having coffee. Juns, about last night-- Shh! No drama, please. Okay. [phone ringing] I'm going to be late. [downbeat instrumental music playing] [Kurt] Is that so? Fix your relationship when you get back home. Bro, we're here to have fun. Remember? I really don't get Junamae! So, I'm the one who's at fault here? [in Taglish] I'm the cold-hearted bitch and you're the martyr? [in Tagalog] Now you'll talk, when others are listening! But when it's just us two, you don't want any drama! Because you're pissing me off. Cut it out, guys. [in Taglish] Please, not now. We're here to have fun. We only come here once a year. [in Tagalog] I shouldn't have come. I knew we'd fight. [in Taglish] I'm going to go home so I won't ruin your trip! [Ma-an] Sis! Sis. [in Tagalog] No, I'm going home. You'd rather please your friends than me. Who am I to you? I'm not even your boyfriend. -Hadj. -I'm not your husband. Nothing! If we get married, we will only get hurt. [Denzel in Taglish] Hadj, just relax.-- No one has to leave! Okay? Let's take this opportunity to fix your problem with Juns. [Kurt in Tagalog] Fuck you all! [in Taglish] Am I the only one who's legit excited with this tradition? You even brought your bullshit here. We barely see each other as it is! [in English] Shut up, Kurt! [in Tagalog] It's you who we barely see because you never show up. [in Taglish] The rare times you do, you're always on your laptop. -[in Tagalog] That's my job. -[Junamae] We have jobs, too! You think I'm the only one who notices? Why don't you ask them? Wow. You're talking behind my back. [in Taglish] Don't play the victim here, Kurt. [in Tagalog] Why? Where were you when Denzel opened his bar? [in Taglish] You always said you'd try, but did you ever show up? Did you even text us that you couldn't make it? [in Tagalog] Where were you when Denzel was shattered over Wesley? Juns. [in English] He should hear this. [in Taglish] He claims to be the perfect friend. [in Tagalog] I didn't say that. [Junamae] Where were you when Ma-an had a nervous breakdown? Did you help Ma-an with her vlogs even once? You haven't even made her the banner you promised. [in Taglish] Now Hadji and I are the ones with a problem, you don't want to help. Is that what friendship means to you? Honoring a stupid pact? [sniffles] [instrumental music playing] [Kurt in Tagalog] Ma, it was so beautiful. It was my first time seeing a meteor. We should have a family trip over there. You'll enjoy it. Promise. Kurt, now that you're a college graduate, you should help with the bills. Ma, let Kurt relax. He already went camping! I'll assign your brother's tuition to you. And also the Internet costs. -Ma. -What's the problem? When your papa and I were your age, we were already breadwinners. When your papa was in the US, he'd work as a bag boy at the grocery after work. And on weekends, he would babysit the neighbor's kids. Ma, life is different now. Competition is tighter. It's hard. Really? When your grandpa was 16, he was already fighting the Japanese. After the war, he set up a bakery. -He bought a house at a young age. -Ma! [in English] Okay, I get it. [in Tagalog] Here. I don't like the lettering. It's too plain. Sir, you chose that font from the options I gave you. Do you have something like Comic Sans? Okay. Sir, you only said up to two revisions. If you want another revision, there's a separate payment. Hey! Are you done with your readings? -No more Grandr. -No more ONS. You're going to be a housewife. You can now run for councilor. [laughter] [in English] Denz, what the fuck! [instrumental music] [Ma-an in Tagalog] So, what do you call Wesley? I want to hear it. -[in English] Baby back ribs. -[laughter] -Baby back ribs! -[in Tagalog] What's going on? Hey, what's going on? Nothing! Why don't you join in sometimes? Sir? Do you have a condo? [in Taglish] I'm not interested. [in Tagalog] Why? Not rich enough to buy? [in Taglish] It's not my priority yet to own a property. Maybe you'd also like to travel like most kids. [in Tagalog] Where to? El Nido? [giggles] Taiwan? Jerusalem? [in Taglish] Maybe next time. [in Tagalog] Why? You're broke? [eerie ambiance] [Kurt's mom] Kurt, have you paid the Internet bill? Yes, Ma. Yesterday. How much is left in your savings account? [sighs] [in English] Eighty-eight thousand. Kurt, eat first. Low batt! [Kurt's sister in English] Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. [in Taglish] I'm always hydrated. [coughing] You lack sleep and you're always stressed out. Those things weaken your immune system. [in Tagalog] Go to the pharmacy and tell them it's on me so you won't have to pay. It's okay. I have money. [in English] Kurt, take it easy. [in Taglish] You're burning yourself out. And if you need help with Kerwin's tuition, [in Tagalog] I can help you with that. Sis, [in Taglish] I can handle the responsibilities. When Grandpa was 16, he was already at war-- Ssh! [in Tagalog] Ma, is that you? I'm not working just because Ma told me so. I want to get rich. I want to buy my own condo. My own car. I want to travel. I want to eat in restaurants where the price of each meal is more than 500 pesos and not feel guilty. Here. [in Taglish] Gift certificates from my patient. [in English] This one is for an out-of-town resort. This one, for an overnight stay at a nearby hotel. [in Taglish] When you're feeling better, I want you to take a break. [in English] Recharge. Pamper yourself. [in Taglish] What about my work? You're a freelancer. [in Taglish] Your time is in your hands. Declare a personal holiday. [alternative music playing] [engine roaring] [violin playing] [instrumental music playing] [water splashing] [in English] Excuse me! Hi, sorry! [in Tagalog] I have a question: Is the water hot? [in Taglish] Well, duh! That's why it's a hot spring. [in Tagalog] I mean, is it scalding hot? But... it seems you're enjoying it. So, I guess it's okay. Is it okay if I take a dip? [in Taglish] Wait. Why am I asking? [in Tagalog] I also paid for this. [in English] Perfect! [in Tagalog] Um... My name's Kurt. [in English] Single? Single. Roxy. [in Tagalog] What? [in Taglish] Uh, it's... sorry, I'm just weirded out. I mean, before you told me your name, you had to ask about my relationship status. To be efficient. So, if I wasn't single, you weren't going to tell me your name? No. I'd just smile at you. In a "civil" way. Like this. [laughs] Your sister, Karen, is right. Don't make your work the center of your identity. You should also have some me-time. Money is hard to earn. Me-time sounds luxurious. Before, I'd just keep accepting gigs. I work in events. I was earning so much. Girl, it was crazy! But eventually, you realize money doesn't make you happy anymore. Your life becomes more convenient, but are you happy? No way, girl! Uh... [chuckles] Why are you calling me "girl"? 'Cause your shorts are too skimpy. I can almost see your balls. [chuckles] Kidding! Girl is just my expression. I know you're cisgender, if not non-binary. -What? -Anyway, your vacation doesn't have to be expensive. I actually live near here. But I realized I work very, very hard. I need this. Otherwise, I, you know-- [in English] Burnout. Exactly. [in Taglish] That's tough, girl. [in Tagalog] How will you go downtown? The resort will provide a service car. Wow, fancy. Bye. [in English] Nice knowing you. Sorry. [in Taglish] I just want to voice out. It's fun for us women that short shorts for men that are form-fitting are back in. Nice thighs, girl! Side view, please. [in English] Side view. [in Taglish] All right, bye! Roxy! Um... Can I have your number? Asking me out tonight? If you're free. Phone? I told you, I don't like beating around the bush. I want efficiency. See you at 9:00 p.m. [in English] Bye! [engine starts] [instrumental music playing] [upbeat music playing] [water running] [both laugh] [in Taglish] Wait, wait. Briefs look better on you. [Kurt in Tagalog] Hey, Roxy, how are you? Me? [in Taglish] Just relaxing. I mean, chillaxing. [in Tagalog] You mean this? This is just... This is just cheap cologne. I've been using this since high school. What? No way! I'm just wearing briefs. [phone ringing] [in Taglish] Hello, Kurt. This is Ian. I hired you to create a logo once. Sir Ian. My friend is looking for someone who can make a poster design. The fee is 25,000 pesos. [in English] Twenty-five thousand? [in Taglish] Okay, Sir Ian. Tell him to email me the instructions. When does he need it? By 2:00 a.m. What? As in tonight? Yes. It's a rush job. That's why the fee is big. Look, Kurt, it's only 7:00 p.m. You still have seven hours. Twenty-five thousand for seven hours of work? That's a good deal, man. Sir Ian... I think... I'll have to pass for now. I'm on vacation. Are you sure? It's 25,000. For sure, there wouldn't be revisions because the client needs it soon. Make it simple but decent. -[in English] Here. -[in Tagalog] Thank you. Just call me when you're ready to order. [in Taglish] What number should I call? Just joking. Hey, handsome. Bow and arrow for your girlfriend? -[in Tagalog] What are you selling? -Hey, handsome. Bows and arrows. For if you want to shoot your enemy. You can also use it on your friend, but expect him to be mad. I also sell bamboo flutes. You can blow on it while pooping if you're bored. Come on and buy. [in Taglish] Your sales talk is pretty good. What's this? [in Tagalog] That's a whistle. A bird whistle. Try it. It's clean. Go ahead. Oh no! A bird! You're nuts. -Just kidding. -Do you think my date will like this? [in Taglish] Yes! If she likes birds! -You're such a comedian. -Buy it. -How much is this? -Fifty. You don't like this? This is a bigger bird. -No discount? -No, it's only 50 pesos. -Fine. -No bow and arrow? [in English] Ready to order, sir? [in Taglish] Okay. One tea. Peppermint. Okay, sir. Thank you. [whistles] [discontented muttering] Sorry. [phone ringing] Hello? [Roxy] Hello? Who's this? It's Kurt. I'm here. Are you on your way? Oh no. Didn't you receive my text? I accepted a last-minute gig tonight. I'm hosting at a local beauty pageant. The talent fee's 3,000 pesos. -It'd be a shame not to take it. -So... [in Tagalog] we're cancelling? [in Taglish] Most likely, girl. [in Tagalog] How about tomorrow? [in Taglish] Let's have brunch before I check out. [in English] Negative, girl. [in Taglish] I have an out-of-town gig in Macabebe. [whistling] [suspense music playing] [all chanting in Tagalog] Work! Work! Work! [shouts] [in Taglish] Hello, Sir Ian. Have you found another poster designer? -[in Tagalog] We're still negotiating. -Let me do it. -I'm available now. -Really? [panting] [phone ringing] [in Taglish] Hello, Denz. Sorry, I'm busy right now. [in Tagalog] I have work. [phone ringing] [in Taglish] Miss Joy. Tarp design? [in Tagalog] Of course I can. When do you need it? [instrumental music playing] [in English] Sorry. [in Taglish] I wasn't there during the times you needed me. [in Tagalog] I was also... preoccupied with stuff. But go on... if you want to go home, go home. What do I care if our friendship is ruined? I'm not the cause anyway. Swim all you want, jerk! Suit yourself! [shouts] -[Kurt] This is fun. -Juns. [Ma-an] Sis, are you really going home? Yes. I'll just wait by the road. I'll go with you. Whatever. You've been like that since you lived together. You've kept to yourselves. Denzel, let them leave. Ma-an, come on! This is fun! [yelling] [Hadji] What now? Looks like there are no more tricycles going to the bus terminal. Whatever. [in Taglish] I'm never going back there. [sighs] [acoustic guitar music playing] Juns. I know you hate drama. I'm sorry. But I can't live in this kind of setup anymore. Having no labels. Maybe I'm just insecure. I'm scared that, without any label, [in Tagalog] you could just leave me for someone better. I'm aware I'm kinda crazy. But that's how it is these days. If it's broken, throw it away. Find a replacement. Find a new one. [in Taglish] Give me two weeks to move out. [in Tagalog] You don't have to rush. Thanks for everything, Hadj. [in Taglish] I'm sure we're going to find partners who will match our respective trips in life. [in Tagalog] I hope so. [chuckles] Friends? How is it done? [chuckles] Friends? Friends. What, you came here just to use your gadgets? [in Taglish] I'm texting with Junamae. I'm just checking if they found a ride. They're so melodramatic! Have they replied to you? [in Tagalog] They haven't found a ride yet. Why don't we help them? You're leaving me alone? [in Taglish] Kurt, stop being a brat! [in Tagalog] One more rant and I'm also leaving. Then leave! [in English] You know what? Fuck this tradition! And fuck you! [in Tagalog] You're arguing with all of us! Denz, are you going with her? I'll just walk her to the road. Denz, you're wasting your energy-- [in English] Shut up, Kurt! Shut up! [Ma-an in Tagalog] I'll go with you, guys. Kurt is a jerk! [Hadji] What happened? [in Taglish] He's an asshole. [in Tagalog] He wants to piss us all off. [in Taglish] He's really changed since he became an in-demand graphic artist. If you don't find a bus, use my car. Hadj, you drive. I'll get it from you tomorrow. -[in Tagalog] How are you going home? -With Angry Boy, how else? Good luck putting up with him. [phone ringing] Kurt's sister. [Hadji] Answer it. Karen? Hello? Hello, Denzel? Have you seen Kurt? I've been trying to call him, but his phone is off. Is he with you? [in Taglish] Yes, he's with us. But not now. Why? Mama found something in his trash bin. [in English] We think it's a suicide note. Is he fine? Juns, let me carry that. [all calling] Kurt! [all calling] Kurt! [all calling] Kurt! [in Taglish] Guys, what if he drowned? [all calling] Kurt! [all calling] Kurt? Kurt! -[Ma-an] Kurt! -Kurt! [Ma-an] Kurt! [in Tagalog] Is he inside? He's not here. What's that? Kurt? -[Denzel] Kurt. -[Junamae] Kurt. [all calling] Kurt! [Denzel] Kurt, Karen called. They found something in your trash. Kurt, what was that? Are you planning to kill yourself? Don't be like that, bro. Guys, put away your lights. Is there something you want to tell us? I wrote that the other day. I was about to do it. I don't know. Whatever I do, whatever I buy, whatever I achieve, I still feel blank. Kurt. Kurt. Kurt! You're spaced out. What's on your mind? Nothing, Ma. What is it? -Ma. -Hmm? I think... [in Taglish] I have depression. Depression? Why would you be depressed? You live in a subdivision. [in Tagalog] You eat three times a day. You finished college. You have your own car. You wear nice clothes. Your room has air-conditioning. Son, you're not handicapped. That's the problem with the Internet generation... [high-pitched ringing sound] [loud clang] IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT I GIVE UP. Then... I remembered it was almost April 26th. I could be with you guys again. I told myself that maybe if I spent time with you, [in Taglish] even just overnight, this feeling would go away. [cries] [in English] I'm sorry, Papa Kurt. I didn't mean all the things I said. I'm so sorry. [sobbing] [Ma-an in Tagalog] I love you. I love you, Kurt. [Kurt] Sorry, I threw a fit earlier. I thought I was the only one going through something. [sobbing] [in English] Please, [in Tagalog] don't leave me. [in Taglish] I need friends. [in Tagalog] We're right here for you. [Denzel] We're always here. [upbeat alternative music playing] [laughter] [Kurt in Taglish] In an age when everyone can call you a friend after clicking Like and a few hyperlinks, having genuine friendship is very important. Not the kind built only through partying, photos, or overnight camping, [in Tagalog] but the kind of friendship forged and strengthened by real life. Friendship that has been tested by luck and misfortune. By good times and bad. By pain and by love. This is us. We may not change the world right now, or solve every problem in society, but for sure, we got one another's backs. And for that, I love my squad very much. [upbeat alternative music playing]
