When you are working on a case that you think is a wrongful conviction, you're only on one side. And that side is getting to the truth. 18-year-old Hae Min Lee disappeared on January 13. Police found her half-buried body. She had been strangled. The suspect is Adnan Masud Syed. I've been saying to Adnan, "We should go to media. We should go to journalists. 'Cause they can do things we can't do." Adnan Syed's story has captivated millions since the launch of the podcast Serial. It's our responsibility as investigators to consider other suspects. Now, Adnan Syed heads back to court as questions about his case continue to surface. This is a piece of evidence that nobody even realized existed for all these years. I might've been the last person to see him. I'm telling you, that's what happened. I wish I never would've talked to y'all in the first place. This is perhaps the critical piece to the state's case. Now, I know there are things that don't look good for me. Full search, guys. Man, they didn't even kill the motherfucker. How's it going, Louis? Same old. Hey, CO! When we getting out of here, man?

Then next time, turn the other cheek. That ain't how it works. Well, I guess you're fucked now, aren't you? Get your fucking hands off me, man. You don't be pulling on me and shit like that, bending my motherfucking hand up. Punk motherfucker. You're gonna fucking go. Oh, okay. What you gonna do about it? Go get your brothers, huh? Row five. Get dressed. Investigator Danvers wants to see ya. I thought we were too old for this shit. Yeah, you and me both. Now I got to call you in over this latest round of bullshit that we both know is beneath our pay grade. Uh, you and me got different pay grades. What's going down with you and the Uniteds? No idea. You're lying. Come on, Officer Meadows got you on camera fighting with that young guy probably from the Uniteds. Officer Meadows? What? Meadows. Yeah, yeah, what's going on with you all? Like I told you, Mike, I got no idea. Ah, you're bullshitting me. Hey, um, the kid came up to me looking for money. Why? Why? Y'all had us on lockdown for three fucking months. Ain't nobody got no cash. Why you think? Did you know the kid? Who? Which kid? Stop playing games, the Beech kid. Beech? Dante Beecher, that's the kid you fought. Beech? What the fuck kind of name is Beech? I don't know. Beecher, it's his fucking name. What do I... Is this the first time that you had contact with him? With who? Oh. Hey, look, I've never seen the kid before. I got no reason to mess with him, and what, you think I want to spend my last five weeks in the SHU? Did he have any affiliations coming in? Who, Dante Beecher? Yes. The fuck would I know? I'm just saying, Terry must want him awful bad if he's willing to send him after you. Yeah, Terry's a fucking dumb-ass sending anybody after me. Uh, he's probably desperate... because of what happened up at Indiana State. What happened? The Uniteds put a hit on Warren. Guy died. Head of the Syndicate? Yeah, and you know things could get real bad real fast... Which is why I need you to tell me what you hear. Fuck out of here. Hmm. Come on, Louis. Fake-ass sugar. Never been a snitch, not about to start. I've never hesitated to throw you in the hole, and I'm not about to now. I got a bad heart. I got fucking prostate cancer, but I still show up at this shit hole each and every day. At least you got a choice. They don't pay me enough for choice. Yeah, well, maybe they should give you a raise every time you throw somebody in the hole. You know, you must have thrown me in there at least 15 times. You deserved every single one of 'em. Nah, I deserved maybe four. You were running the entire prison. Nah, I was helping out Moses, but I was never really running the whole show. That's a bold-faced lie. After Moses passed, it was all you, and we both know that. Ah, you embellishing. What are you talking... we knew that you were bringing in eight to ten ounces of powder every month, every month. Fuck out of here. What are you talking about... "Get the fuck out of here"? I was the one who caught that chick Sleepy, and she told me the whole thing. She was stuffing it so far up there, you couldn't find it with waterproof night-vision goggles. Talk about putting people in the hole. Holy shit, man. She a pretty girl, though. Yeah, yeah. Hey, I used to get with her in the infirmary broom closet. Yeah, I-I'm gonna pretend that I didn't just hear that. Hear what? I didn't say shit. Point is, if Terry's up against the wall, then he's gonna kick back. There's no doubt about that. And I need to know what's coming, and... you're probably gonna have that information before me. Listen, everyone knows you didn't want Terry to take over from you. So maybe you'll help me out. I'm not saying you want the Syndicate to win. I'm just saying that... you might enjoy seeing Terry stumble. If I did... it wouldn't be that way. All right, then. That's it? We're through? For now. Leave 'em. I ain't did shit. This shit crazy, man. Hey, young blood. Run up on me again, I'm gonna stretch you. Hey, big dog, let me talk to you for a minute. What's up? What's the problem, Louis? Terry sent this fresh fish after me talking about paying rent. Not all at all, man. That was Spider. That wasn't Terry. Bullshit, Macon, it's disrespectful. Look, we got a situation on our hands. I don't give a fuck. You don't send nobody after me. I don't care what you give a fuck about, Louis. Your ass is going home in a few weeks anyway. So we doing what we need to do. Now, you know Terry respects you. Then why he sending people after me? 'Cause we gearing the fuck up. And even if he did call it... You heard what happened in the city. That don't affect me, Macon. Everything affects everything. Now, your ass either with us or against us. And if this about you still... Now, if this about you still being mad about not getting a piece of the tray, now, you know... It ain't about that, Macon. So then back the fuck up, and let's do what the fuck we need to do, then. You ain't running shit no more. Hey, let me tell you something... you ain't either. Huh? Anything else you need to say? Don't be sending motherfuckers after me. Yeah, what the fuck else? Better give a brother some space, motherfucker. Yeah, there's a lot of space out here. Yeah, you know I know your people. Yeah, I know. What the fuck that got to do with me, though? Louis, I was thinking about that Teddy "Powdergrass" song you were singing. Pendergrass, man. Exactly. I was thinking how easy it must be for old-school black dudes to get laid. All you got to do is put on the "Powdergrass," roll up some smoking grass, run a hot bath, and boom, instant horniness for whatever chick is listening. Well, it does help grease the wheels, Larry. Hold it for minute, will you please? Hold on. Hey, Ted. Jerry, what's happening? Well, Nellis said he lent you a-a brake spring stretcher he signed out. He did, and I gave it back to him. Well, he says you still have it. What? I don't got it. I put it right over there. It's not there, man. That's bullshit. I put it on that damn stool next to him. All right, all right, can you hold the work for a minute, please? Dansey, will you please turn the radio off? All right, now, I'm looking for a brake spring stretcher, and I don't want anyone moving till we find it. So, Ted... Where'd it go? What happened to it? Well, maybe that damn thing just fell. So get on the floor and start looking, 'cause not one single person leaving this place until we find it. That's just... that's just the way it is. I'm gonna find that damn brake spring stretcher. I know it's around here some-motherfucker-where. All right. A lot of dangerous stuff down here on the floor, so he got to find it, otherwise gonna be trouble for everybody. This dumb motherfucker fell, nowhere there. This motherfucker over there. There it go. Here's the damn thing, Jerry. All right, then. Now, everyone, if you borrow a tool, you must replace it directly in a person's hand, or we could have a problem. Can I go back to my station now? Yes, you can. Okay, everything's fine now. Let's get back to work. Hey, Dansey, would you please put the radio back to my station? ♪ My, my whale in the sky ♪ ♪ Just got up and don't know why ♪ ♪ If I start, I know I will ♪ ♪ Come back all the time to kill ♪ ♪ I see others floating back ♪ ♪ Cashing in on my own high ♪ ♪ Stealing as they don't know why ♪ ♪ I see people floating back ♪ ♪ Cashing in on my own high ♪ ♪ Stealing as they don't know why ♪ I thought about the other day. I didn't know who you were. Okay. I meant you no disrespect. I'm Beech. Louis. All right, then. Hey, Louis, let me holler at you. Hey, Louis, that fine-ass woman calling you. What happened at auto body this morning? Oh, you know I can't tell you that, Samantha. You got a mouth. Hmm. Hmm. I heard Mr. Piner fired that new guy, Ted. No, he got mad at him, but then they found the tool. Yeah, but I heard they fired him anyway. That's news to me. Well, it won't be no news when this place goes back on lockdown. Hey, Louis. Ms. Ludlow. I spoke to your sister. She said she's got a room all fixed up for you. Mm-hmm. I'm sure she'll have your favorite meal all ready for you, your first day out. She don't know my favorite meal. Well, then you should tell her. Eh, sister burn water. I'm going to the Golden Corral. I hear they got a banana pudding over there... Out of this world. Come on in and have a seat. So the Golden Corral is not gonna pay you to eat their banana pudding. No, ma'am, you're right. Have you been thinking about a job strategy? Since you've been working in auto body, why not think about that? Start making a list of shops you might apply to. They can help you type up your résumé in the library. And... Now, you remember I signed you up for that restorative justice program? Really? It's part of your parole agreement. It can really make a difference in people's lives, Louis, including yours. But it's not really at the top of my list. I wish we could do more. Yeah, I know, I know you're trying. Yeah, but maybe you can take some more classes once you get out. Maybe. It's normal to feel nervous after 24 years. Um, I really don't want to talk about this anymore. Fair enough. Okay, then, Louis, I will see you in a couple of weeks. Yeah, right, Ms. Ludlow. All right. I'm gonna see you then. Yeah. Yo, what's happening? Come on, boy. You need more follow-through. Only missed by, like, an inch. That's a inch too much. Follow-through, see that? Key to a perfect shot. See what I'm talking about? You feel that? Same way I shot it the first time. Nah, you had more extension that time... Follow-through. Do it... do it again. Yeah. There you go. Hey, yo, Beech! We need one! Hey, man, I'll holler at you later, man. Hey, let me breathe on you for a second. You know, normally I ain't one to preach. And I mind my own fucking business. But running with them... No future in it, especially with what's going on right now. When it pop off, you be the first to get it. You just saying that shit 'cause you don't like 'em. Who said I don't like them? Terry. It's obvious, man. You used to be the mayor, right? Hey, let's go, motherfucker. Fuck that. Hey... dignity, self-respect, grace... At the end of the day, that's what you want to try to hold on to in here. Might not mean much to you now, but it's something to remember. Let's ball, man. Louis? Hey. Yeah. Louis Menkins, right? Okay. Louis, we're just gonna go over here and have a-a private room, and we'll have a chat. Does that work? Yeah. Great, great. Um, sorry, did I introduce myself? No. You can all me John Pinkins, or Johnny's fine. I'll be your parole officer for your release, you know, during your parole, for any supervision, assistance... After you. All right. Thanks. So I read your case file before, but I was just... yeah, just brushing up on it. And... okay, uh, I'm gonna have a mint. Am I allowed to give you a mint? Do you want a mint? I'm all right. Okay, so what I can tell from your... your file is... Yeah, I'll have a mint. Here. Um... so it looks like your release date is... July 18th, uh, at which point will have been incarcerated for exactly 24 years and 3 months of a 60-year sentence, which was cut to 30 and has been reduced to 24... 24-3. Dash three due to good behavior/time cuts. Time cuts. Is that correct? Fantastic. Do you have any, uh, questions about that? On that? Nope. Okay, um... I see that your parole is pretty standard. "Required to remain in Indiana for a two-year duration." Okay? "Upon your release, you'll be given a check for $100." Uh, plus my pay, right? It should be, uh, 754 on the 18th. Mm-hmm. After the prison take its cut. Mm-hmm. Victim fund and whatnot. Mm-hmm. Okay, uh, sorry, I wasn't aware of that, but I will look into it. So we're all good. They, uh... they have any job-placement programs for people just getting out? Oh, you mean like a halfway house? No, I mean like job placement, you know, skills training, anything? Uh, is it something you've spoken to your social worker about? Uh, she just deals with stuff on the inside. Um, I mean, there's nothing formal that we're set up to do, but I can certainly advise you of job opportunities that... As they come up. Um, Louis, do you have a college degree? How about a GED? Yeah. Great. So you're comfortable with reading and writing and all that? I'm fine. Okay. Okay, great. Okay, cool. Oh, and there's our time. Um, so I'm gonna look into the skills thing, okay? And I'm gonna totally do that. Um, I really look forward to this. Cool? Yeah, cool. Okay, cool. Cool. Big Black, what's good? It's lit, it's lit. Hey, what's up, Louis? Yo, yo, yo. Yeah, my fault I'm late. Yeah. Where were you? I had to run by admin, check in with my PO. Oh. Excited about getting out? You know, wouldn't you be? Probably a whole mix of emotions, you know? Like I said, it ain't always easy on the outside either. Oh, you're talking about your wife. No, granted, she ain't the first person to ever come down with lung cancer, but... Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, thank you, Louis. Yeah, so, uh, what happened yesterday with Ted, though? Oh, it turns out he was trying to steal that spring stretcher. How you figure? Because Jonesy told me he saw him put it in the welder on purpose. Jonesy told you that? Yeah, but I don't want to get Jonesy in trouble. That's between you and me, all right? I mean, we got to keep this group tight, otherwise they're gonna eliminate the whole program. Yeah, I hear you. Who are you gonna replace him with? Well, you got any recommendations? Well, there's this new kid named Beecher... No, I don't... I don't hire new kids, you know that. I just thought he might be a nice fit. I'm fixing to retire. Might be nice to get some young blood in here. All right, well... Well, we'll think about it, all right? In the meantime, let's get you set up for work. All right. Hey, Charles, you good. Go ahead and drive, man. Hold on, hold on. Louis. Yo. I'm going to your city one day. I like New York. I hear you. It might be a couple years... a couple years or so, you know. All right, there you go, pull up. Hey, Charlie. Yeah. Hey, I appreciate it, man. Hey, everyone need help every now and then, Louis. All right. Just put it right there. Meet Beecher. How you doing? All right. Hey, Beech, check it. Yeah. Come on. You know anything about cars? Yeah, actually, I do. My pops used to fix them up for fun back in the day. Which day? I just meant when I was younger. Dickies or onesie? Fuck a onesie. Dickies? No doubt. Pops still around? Nah, he cut out on us. He teach you anything? He didn't teach me shit. Taught his brother, so I learned from him. Boom. Hold this. You gonna give me this? It's possible. Why? Maybe just trying to help the next man get along. Grab you a rag, too. Why is that so important? I don't really know. Karma. Either that or fuck with Terry. Just don't fuck it up. A lot of motherfuckers would kill for this. Better than sitting in your cell all day rotting your brain and watching TV. Here, put a little fat on your head, make you a little cheese while you're doing it... dollar a day. Hey, Louis, you want to get back to work on this Sunfire? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So... you know I knew about cars, huh? Sixth sense. Right. Crap. Let's go. Yeah, let's go, Beech. Hit the fucking shot, boy. Let's go. Uh-oh, he got it. Ooh, what the fuck I'm talking about, boy. Whoo! Man, that boy got skills. Who? New kid who just won that game. Beech. Beech? Beech, Beecher. Fuck, I don't know. Is that the kid you got in auto body? Which one? The fucking kid we're talking about. Right there, the fucking Beech kid. Yeah. Why'd you get him into auto body? You got that kid into auto body? I mentioned him to Piner. You didn't mention me? I didn't know you wanted in. Man, I've been trying to get into auto body for three fucking years, man. I didn't know that. Shit. You knew Beans wanted in auto body. I didn't know. Shit. Why you got to say it like that? "Shit." Like what? Like you're a motherfucking black man. I was just saying shit. Nah, man, you said "shiiit." That's the way I talk, yo. Oh, Jesus. Nah, now you're saying "yo." I can't say yo? Nah, man, not like "yo." I didn't say it like that. Shit. Motherfucker been in prison ten fucking years, and now he want to act like he's from the motherfucking hood. I am from the hood. I'm from South Bend, fool. Bitch, you from Granger. No, I'm not. Well, Edwardsburg or some shit. It's just outside of South Bend. It's motherfucking farmland and shit out there. Not all of it. You got fucking cows and pigs and shit. I used to go to South Bend to buy my drugs, man. And that's where they capped your motherfucking ass. Yeah. Motherfucker going into the hood talking about, "Yo, you got some motherfucking marijuana and 'shiiit'?" Nigga, please. Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow. White niggas kill me with that shit. Hey, that's how y'all talk about me? Get the kid a stick, man. Bring your ass over here. Get your fucking hands off me. Boy, if you don't put the shit right back where you found it... What's wrong with you? Who did that? Some white motherfucker. Well, then use these instead of lifting shit out of here. That's on me, who put his word on the line to get you in here. You better have that shit back by the end of the day. Or else what? Don't fuck with me, Beech. Whatever. Don't fucking "whatever" me either. Get the fuck out of here with that shit. How's your little protégée working out? I ain't got nothing to do with him. Oh, come on, Piner says he's your guy. You know, Larry... half the time you be all up in people business and don't know shit. What's up with you? Wrong side of the bed this morning? Listen, I was with this woman once. Actually, it was three women. Great night, fantastic. Got up the next morning, wrong side of the bed. Later in the day, I caught my first case. All that bank stuff went down. That's why I'm here all these years with you. You must have thought all that pussy was gonna pay for itself. Seemed worth it at the time. Huh. That's pretty good. I got it. Still mad at me? I put that fucking thing back. I see you eating that bullshit-ass goulash. Half the time I eat in my cell. I thought you didn't have no more side hustles. Frosted Flakes costs $3.20 a box. I got my pay. Plus, you know, I wager on the side. What you reading? "War Against the Weak." Eugenics. America's attempt to create a master race by breeding out the so-called weak. Why you reading that? Trying to understand the history of why things are the way they are around here. In this place? Everywhere. A lot of forces at play that helped get us to where we got. Maybe if I knew then what I know now, made some smarter choices, done things differently, feel me? Look, man... me and Terry are both from South Bend, East Side. He like family. Yeah? What'd he get you for Christmas last year? So, what, I should just go tell him to fuck hisself? Outlast him. Is that what you did? Ain't it true you used to run shit around here? I head you was mad OG. I wouldn't say that. They said you had runners inside and outside the wall, get your hands on anything you want. I did my business. Just don't get nowhere. It do if it gets you what you want. What it got me was in the hole, which ain't good for your head. If I was you, I'd do my bid, get the fuck out. How long you got? 50, do 25. Shit, you'd be younger than me. Put something on your mind... Stay clear of these motherfuckers, 'cause they will take your life if you give it to them. Seem like I got to be here for a while, so I might as well just get comfortable. What are you looking at? You know, I had one friend the whole time I've been down. One true friend. Name was Russell, but they called him "Moses." Moses did run this whole joint. Had to see who was working for him, inmates. You know the deal, recruited his bitches, had them motherfuckers bring in shit straight through the front door, warden looking the other way. But after... after a while... It started getting too hot for him. Got thrown in the hole. Caught a couple cases up in here, got 20 years added to his sentence. He was already in for 70, so at a certain point, he... he just couldn't take that pressure no more, couldn't part the waters. One night, he went back to his cell, grabbed a razor, slit both his wrists, then cut his throat ear to motherfucking ear. And that was the end of Moses. I wouldn't do that. You say that now. Trust me. You know... Play too hard, it take its toll. I know that's when I stepped back. OG, shit about to pop off. See how it play out. I got to go ride with them, bro. Let the bees be still, son. Hell, no! Major fight... Damn fucking Syndicates, man! Come on! Knock his ass out! I'm not a fucking snitch! Fucking pigs! All right, turn around. Turn around. No! Stop resisting! Stop resisting! Young man, stop resisting. Fuck this... Fuck that! Get your fucking... get your fucking hands off me. Hey, Marcus, it's... it's your pops. Hi. Yeah, so... you remember I'm getting out of here next month? Yeah. So I'm... I'm over here trying to keep to myself, but, you know, I can't leave the state of Indiana, you know, 'cause of my parole conditions. And then on top of that, I really haven't put that much away since I've been down, so I don't even know how I'll even get all the way out there to California. No. But that's... now, I'm not asking you. Marcus, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on one minute. Yeah, yeah, here's Sonia. Hey, hey, Marcus. Marcus, don't... Don't put her on yet. Hey. Hi. Hey. Hey, there, baby girl. H-how you doing, Sonia? Uh, that's great. I'm good, I'm good. Huh? Yeah, of course I'm still working on it. I got... I got it almost all sketched out. I think... I think you're gonna like it a lot. I can't wait to see it. I can't wait for you to see it, too. And... I need to go. Oh, okay, then. I love you. Here's the starting lineup and the changes. Andrew Bogut's out with an injury. Andre Iguodala will come off the bench... Hey, Menkins, they're asking to see you again. For what? Row five. Your guess is as good as mine. Don't ask 'cause I'm not a mind reader. Maybe it's about you getting out. Hmm. Hands up. Spread your fingers, show me the backs of your hands. Reach your hand across your face, pull your ear back. Turn toward me. Run your fingers through your beard. And open your mouth for me. Take your fingers, pull your cheeks apart. Raise your upper lip, bottom lip, stick your tongue out. Turn for me. Keep turning. Stop. Bend at the waist, spread your buttocks. And get dressed. Have a good day. Thanks for sitting with us, Louis. As you know... Does he know? Investigator Baxter handles STGs in Pendleton. Security threat groups... Gangs. I know what they are. Great, so then you know it's serious business. Yeah, I do. So then you probably also know we've had a situation that's arisen due to an attack on the leader of the Syndicate Crew up at Indiana State Penitentiary. I heard some rumors. Well, clearly, they're more than rumors at this point. Now, I understand that you spoke to Investigator Danvers and that you decided that you did not want to share whatever knowledge you might have, but given subsequent developments, I'd like to give you a second chance. So, you, uh, march me in here for the entire population to see me coming in here again to talk you. They have no reason to suspect what you're being asked. Bullshit. You monitor gangs for the fucking prison. Louis... Oh, sorry, STGs. What do you want me to do, Louis? Communicate with you via text? I don't have a phone. Yeah? Sure about that? The point is, I know your standing in the prison. So I'd like you to take this opportunity to tell me anything you know about what Terry Macklin is planning against the Syndicate. I don't know nothing. I don't believe you. That's your problem. Don't fuck with me, Louis. I can make life really hard for you in here. Fuck you, worm. Don't fucking threaten me. All right, Louis, calm down. I'll fucking threaten you. I'll do whatever I need to fucking do to maintain the safety of the offender population. I bet you will. I know you know things! Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Same like I told Danvers here, who at least had the decency to ask instead of demand. Don't you ever call me in here and walk me across the yard like a bitch-ass snitch. Have some respect before I smack the fucking cum taste out your mouth. Fuck you. Louis. I'm sorry. Come on. Louis. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let him talk to you like that. Motherfucking worm. Come on, come on. He's just doing his job. We also shouldn't have brought you over like that, but you got to be careful. Of what? Well, for one thing, that Beecher kid... We know he's gonna get patched. It's in your best interest to stay away from him. The kid just need a friend, Mike. Yeah, well, don't forget the oldest prison rule... Anyone who wants to be your friend, watch the fuck out for them. You motherfuckers, stay out of my shit. Second crew, J cell, 7-13! Get your punk ass down now. Hit that son of a bitch. Stop resisting. Stop resisting. Stop resisting, stop resisting. Man, fuck all y'all. Get off me. Get up. Keeping free of this mess? You know how it is. East Side roll with U.I., especially when shit about to go down. Always some dog shit to step over. I already told you... We're both East Side. Joint about to pop off black and white. You know I got to rep mine. Just like that, right? The Syndicate dude probably owed money so they hit him, or, fuck, you don't know... Maybe it's some lover bullshit or something. But now all of a sudden, it's a black-and-white thing, huh? I don't give a fuck what it's about. It don't even matter. You think Terry is willing to die for you 'cause you from the East Side? The prison let this gang shit survive 'cause the prison want it. It's all a game. In 1992, I was at a pay phone, and a man, this man, came up to me. He was planning on stealing my car, and he put a gun... point blank in my face and fired. I spent eight years in prison. When I got out, there was a court hearing, and Janice and her family were there. And at a certain point, I asked the judge if I could speak. When I did, Janice's family started shouting me down before I could get going. Ten years after that, I looked Sean up. And when I found him, I asked him, "What were you trying to say to me that day?" And he said, "I wanted to apologize"... Which began a conversation. And here we are now, wanting to continue that conversation with people like you. The victim participant in your case is Karen James, sister of the deceased. She's obviously been living with and processing this crime for many years, but she signed up. And I can tell you firsthand, Louis, to look your victim or, in this case, a relative, in the eye and own what you did... not easy. But I promise you, it'll be worth it. The three values of restorative justice are encounter, amends, and reintegration. I shot a man, and I robbed his house while his dying body was in the trunk of my car. How do I make amends for that? We're not out to fix. You can't repair the harm you've done. But to sit with her... to tell her how you feel can help repair the harm done to her. And to you, Louis. To own what you did is to heal. Someone wants to talk to you. I ain't gonna say it again, brother. Move. Afternoon, Louis. Terry. I imagine you've been expecting this. Fuck you. This what? Fuck me. This what? That's how you feel when you say fuck me like that, huh? So what do I have to do? I have an iron hand... without the velvet glove. What'd you call me down here for, dude? We need Beecher with us. So I'm gonna ask you to stop putting shit on his mind. I got a organization to run. Things are tight, I need to value he has. He got good hands, he's smart, he's an asset. Now, Macon offered to cut you in. I don't want no part of that. That's your decision. Relax. But I can't have you talking with Danvers or Baxter or any other motherfucking officer or administrative official here. You feel me? We through? No. I got a price on my head, Louis. Last thing I need is you interfering. Now, are we good? And now, are you through? You know what time it is. Get out the way, man. Louis, can I holler at you a little bit? Yo, you got that 30? No, man, but I got a little something else for you, though. A little knowledge that fell from a tree. Man, I'm out of this joint in a week, Pete. That don't affect me. Not if it's going down like it's supposed to in auto body. Not if what's going down? They're supposed to be bringing a whistle in. A piece? Yeah, a fucking gun, through the auto body, man. Where you hear that? The ear hustle, man. Who bringing it? You work up in there. So we good on that 30? Hey, yo, Patrick, you got a sec? Sure, what's up, Louis? Brah, I heard there's a strap coming through auto body. Is it for you? Come on, let's go. If I needed a piece, I wouldn't bring it in like that. Why not? Can't trust Piner. Why? He's working both sides. Jerry Piner? You didn't know that? Terry's been controlling Piner for the last year. Piner looks away, Terry brings in phones. So now Piner's letting Terry bring in a piece? Piner's got no choice. Terry's got a paper trail on him. Plus, he needs it. Piner's got a sick wife. Okay, so, who's picking it up when it come through? You sure you want to know all this? Knowledge ain't always a good thing... Man, just tell me who moving it. Whoever you placed in there most recently, Louis. Beecher. He's not STG, no affiliation, he knows cars... Putty in Terry's hands. Terry got Beecher that job to bring in heat. That's why he got that dude Ted fired out of there. You thought you got little Beecher that job? You know Terry's gonna use the kid. Yeah. Thanks, man. Don't be doing nothing stupid, Louis ♪ The longest train ♪ ♪ I ever saw ♪ ♪ Was on that ♪ ♪ Georgia line ♪ Thank God it's Friday. Take care of yourself. Have a good weekend. Hey, how's it going, Louis? Kind of slow. Anything new coming in, Jerry? Well, we're supposed to get a pickup in a few days. Oh, yeah. Where's it coming from? A friend of a guard over in D cell.

Fucking asshole. 93B715. Menkins? Yeah. The doctor wants to see you in the sick call room. Me? Yeah, sick call room. What's the deal? What the...? That nurse in there is the only one I trust. Why don't you have a seat? I'm fine how I am. No more fucking around, Louis. We know there's something coming in from outside, and I need to know what and how, and I'm pretty sure that you have that information. Why would I? 'Cause you probably talked to Patrick, and Patrick fucking knows everything. So fucking talk to Patrick. Patrick does not talk to us. Me neither. Well, then I will extend your sentence by 20 years on charges of conspiring to smuggle contraband, and you will die a lonely fucking death within the confines of your cell because I can fucking arrange that. Yeah, I don't think you can legally do that. Are you fucking kidding me? Whatever it is that's coming, just tell me how. Is it over the wall? Trash truck, laundry, food, auto body, CO, staffer, visitor? Just tell me where to look. I got no idea. Do you not think I'm serious? I'm sure you are. If Terry Macklin makes that hit, people are gonna get hurt, and your wish of not being on lockdown for your last days will go right out the window because you won't have any last days. You will be here forever, and this place will be shut down for eight months, I swear to fucking God. Do you, dude. Stupid fucking mistake. Get me out of here. Man, I ain't got time for this. Walk in, Louis. Louis, go in. Louis, go in. Hey. You ready? For what? You have a meeting with the restorative justice committee or something. Louis, good to see you. Louis, this is Karen James, sister of Abraham James. Karen was eager to meet with you. Hi, Ms. James. Hi. Please. It's good to see you again, Louis. Anybody want to get started? Or maybe talk about how you're feeling right now. Uh, I'll start. Um... the last time I saw you was in court. I had a lot of hatred and anger toward you, and I've been wanting for many of those years since to find a way to let that go. And being here today right now, even though some of those feelings still exist, I can also say that I am no longer consumed by them. And seeing you, as you are now, as a human being is meaningful. That's great to hear, Karen. Thank you, that's great. Uh, thank you for saying that, uh, Ms. James. And I hope you do know that I very much regret what I did to your brother. It seems almost silly now to say that after all these years, but it certainly is true. I was a very dumb kid, young man, um, when I did that. And I've tried, um, to use these years here to learn from it... uh... to not be that person... um, and to be a better human being. Thank you, Louis. That's amazing to hear. And how old would your brother have been today? Uh, he would have been 50 years old. The night of the robbery, the night your brother was killed... I just remember him being a very brave man. And as you may know, there was no real beef between us. It was more the groups that we were with. And I just remember, uh, him being very brave in the face of what went down. Could you tell me more about that, about what went down? You... you want me to? Yes. Well, um... I was supposed to rob him. He was carrying cash, and I was selected to go get it. And when he didn't give it up, uh, we started yelling, and... and he ended up getting shot. Why? 'Cause he didn't do what I told him to. But why did you shoot him? W-why didn't you just hit him or even just shoot him in the foot? Well, he had a... He had a gun, too, Ms. James. Still, couldn't you have just hurt him instead of kill, instead of shooting him in the head? So that his brains just... just... fell on the... I'm sorry. It's okay. I just... May I say something else? Of course. I don't want you to get out. I don't think you should. And I-I'm so sorry, I don't mean this to be vindictive, because I know the law, and I respect it, and... and... and... and I would never try to stop it, but I just feel that I have to say that sitting here knowing Mr. Menkins is soon to be released, I would be lying if I didn't say out loud that I don't believe that that is the correct decision. And... and I respect you. And... and I'm sure that you are truthful in saying that you are a different person. But you killed a man. You shot a man point blank in the head, in his eyes. And you tried to get away with it. And you would have if you own mother hadn't seen the blood on your pants and called the police. And so I do believe that you should remain in prison for that... for the rest of your life. I, um... I understand how you feel. And there are many days... That I've wondered if you're right. That... Maybe this... That this is where I belong. Open the damn thing, man. You haven't started packing up yet? You got less than a week. I ain't got much. I'll get to it. Shit, I've seen guys with a month to go already packed out. Hey. You were right about that thing with Terry. He said if I don't help him, I'm dead. I stayed up all night thinking. It's like all my choices are bullshit. I can't... I can't keep living like this, Louis. What you want me to do? I don't know. Tell that motherfucker no. Hold your ground. He won't mess with you, not if he know I'm looking after you. He doesn't give a shit what you think. I'm sorry, but he don't. And even if he did, you're about to get out. Then what? I still got to wake up in this motherfucker for the next 20 and deal with the consequences. The road is hard that leads to life. Those that find it are few. What the fuck are you talking about? Sometimes the hard choice, the right choice. So then maybe you can make a choice. What do you mean? Maybe, like, do it for me. What, I take the gun out the shop, so now I'm looking at a extra 30? But you wouldn't. How you figure? No one would suspect you. You're about to get released. Terry says I can get away with it because I'm new, but he's lying. Now that I'm in auto body, I'd be the first one they come at when the shit go down. And like you said, it will. No one would suspect you. That's the stupidest shit I ever fucking heard. Look, it's coming today. It's going to be in the back fender. Only thing I need to do is grab it and drop it off by laundry on my way back. I don't want to be this dude no more, Louis. I can't find my way out of this shit. I need your help. All fucking talk. Oh, here she comes. Bring it up. Let's take a look. Right there. Hey, not too bad, not too bad. Well, got a little bumper damage, couple dents here and there. Okay, let's bring it in. Hey, Larry, why don't you and, uh, Beech start on it tomorrow? Oh, yeah, we got this. All right, then. What you think? Can it be done? I'll just, uh... get started on this back bumper. Lefty loosey, righty tighty. Louis, what you looking for? Just, uh, feeling for damage. Hey. Can you grab it for me? And put it where? Put it in your pants or wherever. Doesn't really matter. It ain't got to be perfect, Piner already knows what's up. Louis. Get out of here, man. You gonna do it for me? Please! Start that tomorrow. Great work, gentlemen. All right, let's go. Let's go, wrap it up. Hey, Piner! I think we found something here, man! We got a gun, man! It's a gun! We got a gun, man! We got a gun! It's a goddamn gun! Drop the gun! I need backup in auto body right now! Get away from the truck! Roll, roll your body! Put your faces to the ground! No! Get your hand off... Get your hand off me. What? Pass it back, pass it back. Let's go. Appreciate that. Uh-oh. On your left. Hi-yah! Got it. I may be old... Shoot the damn ball. Put this on. Let's go. You live out there, Louis. You live out there for me, man. I got you, Beans. Moving offender Menkins to 5-10. This is it. What is it? A check for $853.30. Do you need street clothes? Uh, yeah, I can't really wear these. Do you know your sizes? No. All right, wait here. What's up, Louis? Leaving. Yeah, I heard. Yeah, they went to find me some clothes. That's probably a good idea. Yeah. I'm sad to see you go. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, you always were a pretty good friend. No, I wasn't. True. So, um... What actually happened in auto body? Oh, uh, like I told you, I heard a rumor about a gun in the car, and, uh, thought I'd take a look. And you're saying that... that Beecher saw you looking in in that car bumper and then just figured that he had to have a look, too? Yeah. But that he didn't know anything about the gun before that. That's right. You're so full of shit, Louis. Yeah, I can understand. That's complicated stuff. Not really. Hmm. Here you go. Thanks. So what, I just change right here? Yeah, might as well. Sister's picking you up? That's what they told me. What time? Uh, 10:00. I should get back. I got to deal with all the nut jobs. All right, Louis. Don't stay in touch. Don't plan to. All right, we'll buzz you through the gate, and then you're free to go. That's it? That's it.

I feel like if I was to share my story, would this prevent somebody else from committing violence? Tell me a little bit about your childhood? The streets was presented to me at a young age before I even knew myself. We lived in a raggedy trailer on a mountainside. One day, at the gas station... I had left my foster home... My dad said, "Let's go over to the neighborhood." It's one of them things that is unraveled. There's no turning back the clock. How much time did the judge give you? Oh, 45 years. All of us come from different places, but our stories are so similar. I want people to see this and be like, "They needed some help at one point in time, and they didn't get it and look what happened to them." I don't want us getting into making this feel like a sympathy type of thing. Let's also tell the other story of I chose to kill you. Do you think your mentality could have got put back on the right track? I think it was plenty of opportunities. We just couldn't get it back then. We were just livin'. Now we do get it. It's a hard truth, ain't it?
