Ok then, I will never speak to you again. Mayera! - Come on Uday Singh. Sir. Good girl, I'll solve all your problems. Don't worry! Come on. What is this? Emotional blackmail? What emotional blackmail? It's just saffron chicken biryani, and then some delicious, sweet halwa... that's all. You think you'll make my favourite dishes and get me to agree? Forget it! Ok..ok... just enjoy your chicken biryani and forget that bloody loser. Papa he's a Senior executive! So... how does that matter? A senior executive doesn't own the company, does he? How does that matter... as long as he loves me... Nothing happens with love... Love is everything.. If I didn't have your love after mummy died.. ...what would I have done? Why did you play mummy's role too? The other IAS daddy's spent their evenings at the club with their friends... but you stayed home to play with me and my toys. There was no money, but I had you, I had your love. That was enough for me. Just like Mohit's love is enough for me. What more do you need for happiness? Money! You need money... And I'm saying this from experience. Look, I had a government job.. I-A-S, I had a big post but empty pockets. All my life I have been depriving you... never gave you the pocket money.. Or clothes or toys you deserved... You wanted to go to the U.S. for an MBA, I couldn't even give you that. But now I'll get you married to a rich boy who can make your every wish come true... And you'll refuse my biggest wish? Yes... but Mohit is an absolute no... Who's asking you to blindly get married to just anyone? I have a whole file, go ahead and choose yourself, each one has at least a turn over of twenty five crores... yes. Papa... I'm going to marry Mohit! Fine... then do what you want... Whether I live, I die, I'm sad, I'm unhappy, what do you care... Mohit ya... papa is not ready to listen at all... he's being so stubborn! Fourteenth floor please... Do you know Mohit Chaddha? From marketing? How is his character? Mohit sir, he's always stuck to one madam.. Always stuck to madam? She comes here too... no scoop, no scandal. But why are you enquiring about him? Survey Family planning! Mohit Chaddha. - I was passing by your office... had some work... let's have a cup of coffee? Who the hell are you? I'm Sehgal... - Sehgal, who? Sehgal from Income Tax... I've come to file a case on you... Sir but I have filed all my tax returns... I'm Mayera's father Sehgal, you bloody... I'm calling from your office reception. So sorry Sir... I couldn't recognize your voice, because I was talking to you for the first time on the phone... Sir, you had some work here? What's your salary? Sir Sixty five thousand. Sixty five only! Sir my Hindi counting is a bit weak... Sir. Your salary is even weaker... My daughter, Mayera... Seventy two... her salary is seventy two thousand... I know Sir... so proud of her... You know! What kind of a man are you? My daughter's salary is more than yours and you have no problem? Come on Sir, what problem... I love her and she loves me... It's all cool! Look Mr. sixty five, sit here... you know that song about 'let the love never be less, I will take every other loss', is all nonsense. I don't know from which angle you look good to Mayera. Till I don't give my approval, Mayera will not marry you. You know that right? So your probation, your inquiry period starts from today... During this probation, I will examine your every molecule. If I don't detect any problem in you, I will say yes for the wedding. But if I find anything wrong and I reject you, then I want no complication from you. Understand Mr. Sixty five? Just vanish, quietly... You ready for it now? How can I agree, just like that? You will take the exam and give the result as well... I don't think I stand any chance of passing... You have no faith in yourself? I have full faith in myself... but... But? You think I'll cheat? Who knows... It's not written on anyone's face, is it?... Look here you... I was being polite and pretending to give you a choice, actually you have no choice. If you're ready to go on probation speak up, or forget Mayera. Forever. Bloody fool! - I am ready Sir. Sir. Good. Mayera was saying you have no family, your parents died a long time ago. Then at least if I reject you, your family won't be insulted. Let's go. Sir, you had come for coffee.. we serve some awesome capp... Another thing, if you're not interested in sports, then get interested... Sports is my middle name sir. TT, Tennis, squash.. anything.

Mohit has lost his job and you're ok? Mohit lost his job? Didn't you watch the news? If a big company like Air Connect couldn't save its employees, then what about the smaller ones? Demands for safe and secure jobs in the Government are increasing... Applications for Civil Services entrance exams have risen by 21%... In these tough times of recession, private company jobs are... When he had a job, I was willing to compromise. But I will die before I let you marry a jobless man... Please understand this... It's over! - Mohit Hey Mayera, lmmy here...

So everything is safe? Yes, my job is safe... but Mohit's is gone... What? See I told you... I told you Thank God. I'm so relieved that your job is safe. I know ya, but really sad about Mohit... Even papa was so worried. He came to my office! He's right here. Mayera are you okay? Okay bye. I Love you. Papa please go home and rest now. I have to attend a very important meeting.

I heard them say myself... all the marketing guys" listen... marketing... Oh God! Look I'm sorry about this. But I was just promoted! What can I say Mohit. The salary you get after promotion can save the jobs of three people. I don't know... consider this a sacrifice for your juniors. Why don't you sacrifice? Your salary could save the jobs of at least eight people. People who don't know anything about Operations, shouldn't be sitting tight as CEOs! Just watch it Mohit... there's no need to be rude! If I'd been allowed to run Air Connect, I wouldn't let the company even in this time of recession lose a single penny... In fact I was going to quit myself... because you guys don't deserve me. What?

Why don't you say sorry to the boss? I've never said sorry to anyone in my life, why should I say it to this moron?! C'mon, buy me a beer. Okay, okay, don't say sorry... But the media is very hot right now... news channels are gathering here... at least give interviews, get famous and I'll check out the girls. We want our jobs back... We're telecasting from outside the Air Connect offices... give us our jobs back... - People are really worried, and here with me is Mr lmran Rizvi... Mr lmran Rizvi, how are you feeling? Very bad... - Can you tell us in detail... How did you feel when you lost your job? I haven't lost my job, my job is safe... Stop stop... If you haven't lost your job then why are you giving this interview? Because my friend here lost his job... How are you feeling? Scared... - I am sorry, what was that? He says he's scared...

So many criminal cases. How can I marry my daughter to you? Sir, you did this research all on your own? Obviously, it's a confidential matter... what if it gets leaked? You are so cool Sir! Excuse me sir, but how did the government let you go... How could they retire you, seriously... It's a rule, retirement at sixty. It's a damn useless rule sir. At sixty a guy comes into his own. There's a job opening in our company, General Manager Research and Analysis, age limit is seventy... Seventy? - Salary, three lakhs... Teen lakh per annum?! Good Spoken just like a government official. Three lakhs per month sir, per month. Three lakhs rupees per month.. - Ya. Your bill sir - Thanks Let me.. - I insist sir.

I will just withdraw it from the ATM and give it to you. Two thousand... here it is. Thank you sir. Sir who keeps so much cash nowadays? How can Mayera be the daughter of this terrorist? Always ready to drop a bomb! What? Shit! I don't know sir... My credit card is not working... ATM card is not working... lam going to bloody change my bank... What bank is your account in?

All your money is over and you didn't even know? Listen, you should maintain detailed accounts, I will check at the end of each month. What do you mean by every month? You mean I'm such a big idiot that I won't find a job for months? If you're stuck on airlines, then you surely won't get a job... I have mailed you a new job list. The Inner Beauty position is still available. If you get the job, I will get free lingerie. This is like saying if I became a waiter, you'll get free food... So Mayera ma'am, what would you like to order today? On today's menu we have plain paratha, plain butter paratha, plain ghee paratha, aaloo paratha, aloo butter paratha, aloo ghee paratha, gobhi paratha, gobhi butter paratha, gobhi ghee paratha.. Today's special is mix vegetable paratha. Shut up you clown! I've left my meeting half way... I have to go... Ok bye! Mayera! What? What if I really become a waiter? Standing at the cross-roads, Will you marry a waiter? When someone asks a question. You won't become a waiter. - Why do all answers, You never know... - Seem unreliable. What if I have to? Nothing seems real Even then I'll marry you... Now I really have to get to work, ok... On these crossroads I love you Except an imaginary indifference. Papa. Papa - I am so sorry sir Are you ok? - Papa are you okay? Yes I am Yes darling I am ok. So ironical that you want to marry the man.. ...who wants to make you an orphan! How wonderful is that? Papa, don't over react... please go and change, come on... I am sorry sir! No problem, sports is your middle name huh? Taking out your frustrations on the ball? I have tried all the companies on your list, looks like I'll have to become a waiter after all. Your girlfriend is too good... I've already made a new list. Go and change now... Listen, what is this 'new job' tune that you're teaching papa to sing? "I'll take on a job, I'll take on a job", he keeps saying excitedly. I've shut him up. He's worked hard enough for the last 35 years, from home to office and back again. He's worked very hard all his life... It's his time to relax now. Why does he need to work anymore? I can take care of him. Don't hoist him again on the 'three lakh pay-package tower' Ok, promise? Ok...in any case, who's going to hire him? Very funny! Mohit... Hey Mohit - Sir... I'm ready for a new job. Sir Mayera has forbidden it. Who's going to tell her? You frighten me all the time, and now you'll lie yourself? Nobody is going to lie, you fool... When I get the job, we'll tell Mayera. Till then start job hunting for me. Why should I? Because it was your idea, you will do it. No sir, I won't do it. Mayera has categorically said no... OK, then the wedding is cancelled. Go shower bloody... Osama! Hey Mohit. Let's send the application by registered post. Post is so uncool. You'll never get a job if you send a letter in this day and age. Email sir, email. Actually, the real problem is that I don't know how to use a laptop. Not a big deal sir, it works just like a computer. I don't even know how to use computers! You don't know to use the computer? I don't Ok... Do you know to make chicken biryani? You don't, right? Similarly I don't know computers, that's it! Oh Sir... Then for you Sir, we'll have to look for one... that even a fool can use. You called me a fool? You bloody fool! Mayera! - Where? Hello... Yes, actually I'm in a meeting. Yes in an interview... Baby just listen... I'll just call you back. Ok. Love you. Bye. Ok...You stop the car here. Right here. Sir here? - I'm telling you, stop the car. The house is ahead... - You argue too much man... Sir but why? - Again why! Do one thing-jump the wall, then hide and cross the garden... Yes hide, and come in through my bedroom window. Sir isn't this story absurd... Romeo hides from Juliet's father and goes to meet her. He doesn't hide form Juliet to go meet her father. Does Radha work in Juliet's house? - No! Radha will see Romeo, she'll inform Juliet, Juliet will ask her father 'what was Romeo doing with you, out of office, in the middle of the afternoon'? That's correct logic! So do it. - Yeah. Let me send Radha out for some work... Then I'll signal you to come inside. Got it Commando? Aye Aye Captain! ' Roger! Bloody hell. Radha, Radha! - Yes papaji Come here... A few of my shirts and trousers are lying outside the cupboard, take them to the washerwoman and get them ironed nicely. And don't come back till they're all done, even if takes an hour. But Shah Rukh's film on TV... Hey, don't talk nonsense with me... till the job is not done, stay with the washerwoman. What can I say... I'm missing the film... There's always so much work around here... Have you seen it? - Not yet, I'm not that lucky... Oh, you haven't? I'm crazy about Shah Rukh... But ever since papaji has retired, he just doesn't let go off the remote control... Bloody duffer! HEY Hey lovebirds! Hi - Hi Are we the love-birds or are you guys the love-birds? Immy's record-breaking relationship... Two months and still going strong, yes? Yes... Just when Mohit lost his job, Swati came into my life... What? Now everything will be with reference to my job? Before Mohit's job... After Mohit's job? Bad mood huh? Come on show us your dimples man... C'mon show us... Hmmm...very bad mood. lmmy let's go dance! One Long Island ice tea and one rum-n-coke. No rum-n-coke. Yes rum-n-coke. I'm on antibiotics... Do you have the flu? Best medicine, Rum n Coke! One Rum n Coke please. Sir, if my girlfriend would tell me so lovingly... What would you do huh? Shower in Rum and Coke? Go, shower... You just...make your drinks... Mohit... I'm paying... Why do you keep ranting about paying all the time? I don't want it, that's it! Is there some compulsion? Ok, no compulsions...sorry. I am sorry. HEY lam sorry dude! Hey listen...we both are going for the rock show on 25th, ok? But aren't the tickets for Rs 5000? - No if's and but's... I'll pay right now, you can return the money when you find a job! By then I'll be a bus conductor... Better if you take someone else. If you'll be a bus conductor, then I'll become the bus driver. And I'll kidnap you and your bus forever. And what if I become an ice-cream seller? Then I'll buy the van... And I'll gobble up all the ice-cream, and you! Look, it's my job to gobble up... And what if I end up as an auto-rickshaw driver? Then I'll be the traffic cop... I'll cut you a ticket and lock you up in my jail for life. Ok...And what if I land up being a postman? Needlessly, you make and break. Needlessly, you count each penny. Needlessly you're afraid of love. Needlessly you push me honey. Needlessly, you make and break. Needlessly, you count each penny. Needlessly you're afraid of love. Needlessly you push me honey. I'm the heroine of your every story. I'm the happy ending of your every tale. When the storm came, You packed up your things, You emptied my heart and left. If I couldn't pay the rent, Of your heart my love, You would throw me out instead. Hey, I made a promise for life, When the deal was made. But my pockets are empty, how can I repay This debt that I have raised! I will stake my claim and take you home. First let me prove my worth, my love. Needlessly, you make promises of love... Needlessly, you raise your hopes. Needlessly you dream crazy girl, Needlessly, our story's done. I'm the heroine of your every story. I'm the happy ending of your every tale. If you were booze, I'd knock you down. I'd make myself your addiction. I'd be that cloud, That stayed with you, If you became my sky! Sweet to the ears, Not easy to do. To color yourself in another hue. Not easy to do. Colors fade, Just love remains, Everyone else changes- Red orange yellow blue and green. Needlessly, you make promises of love... Needlessly, you raise your hopes. Needlessly you dream crazy girl, Needlessly our story's done. I'm the heroine of your every story. I'm the happy ending of your every tale. Needlessly... Needlessly... Needlessly... Needlessly... I'm the heroine of your every story. I'm the happy ending of your every tale. Not bad Sehgal Sir... You must've thought of an email ID... Vinod Kumar Sehgal. No No its too long?

Not just insurance, I can even market the Qutub Minar! Qutub Minar!? It's not that easy Mr. Chaddha... It's the era of specialization... Thank you for coming. Sir I think I have potential sir...

Yeah, book them! - No listen, this is red lounge... You guys ditched us the last time... 700 rupees were wasted... Please confirm and tell us Mayera... Excuse me your phone Hey - Hi baby.. Six thirty movie... - I can't come... Why, what are you doing? Everyone is going, let's go? Everyone is so worried about my job... That's the reason why I've come for this interview, to end everyone's worries. So I should avoid watching the movie with everyone and focus on my interview. I'm sure everyone will understand. Mohit, these are your friends. That's why they're so worried about you. There's no need to be so sarcastic. Anyway, no chance for the six thirty show right? No chance... There are around 10-11 candidates before me The interviews are extensive, in-depth. But in case it gets over earlier... Damn it! I said there's no chance Ok...best of luck. Hi.. brother - Hi. Sister is in her room. - Ok. Mohit! Mohit.. Hello Hey did you email my application properly? There's no reply from anyone! Why are you getting stressed? You'll get a response soon. Hey, where are you going man? - It's her birthday. Assault mission game...cool huh? Where did you get this from? Palika market. Six hundred. If you'd told me, my guy would've got it for three fifty Your guy wouldn't even get the cover for three fifty. I have a reliable source in Palika. Mohit?! - Ya Coming! Coming! Hi Happy birthday. - Thank you... How do I look? Very hot...shall I gobble you up? Mango! My birthday gift to myself. What did you get for me? That's it? How could I borrow money from you, to get a gift for you? It's my birthday! I wasn't expecting a diamond necklace, you could have got me just a rose... You get pocket money after all.

Go get it! Your cheque...it's bounced again. The landlord's fuming dude. You've got to arrange for the rent today somehow. Bro you help me out today. I'll arrange the money by next week. Dude you haven't returned the last loan either. I need cash badly, please return my cash as well. You know what, forget it... just arrange for this month's rent. And Mohit, bro, do something about your job. I'm working on it, I am. What are you doing? You're just busy flying high in the air! Come back to earth bro, accept a job in a lower position. Why should I? I'm an MBA for God's sake, top of my class. And who got promoted, you or me? I was, and because of that promotion your job got saved. So in return I should pay your rent for the rest of my life? lmmy Get out! You know what...you've started enjoying being unemployed. You want your money? You'll get it... Now just get lost! I don't have fifteen thousand. I spent a lot this month... I got a new dress, my birthday party, your car EMI, your credit card bill, your phone bill, your pocket money... Awesome! Means whenever I ask you for money, I'll have to listen to this entire list? If you had warned me about the rent in advance, I wouldn't have bought the rock show tickets. Rock show tickets! Did I ask you to buy those tickets? Mohit now don't do that... - You don't do that If you had told me earlier, I'd have sacrificed this as well... like all other things. Sacrifice! What a sacrifice! - Yes sacrifice! You don't realize anything... I haven't even bought a new pair of sandals these last two months. O god What a crisis!!! What a crisis!! Yes it is a crisis Stuck on pizzas and your oily omelet's.. I've gained two bloody kilos! I work hard so that I can enjoy my life, but thanks to you, leave alone malls and night-clubs, I've even forgotten the smell of multiplex pop-corn! I don't want to waste my life sitting in front of your television! It's one rock show that I wanted to go for and even for that... you're creating such a scene! Mayera, one rock show! It's just a rock show! You know what, you should be given a Nobel Prize! Somebody, please, give her a Nobel Prize. Any half sensible man would've actually given me a prize! Why prize, I'll give you your money back. Don't stress, I'll settle everything! Ok Mohit every single penny... Of course! With interest! - You are so disgusting Yes, I'm the disgusting one. You're Mother India! Mohit stop the car I said I'll return it. I don't want to sit in your dirty rotten car! Stop the car! Ok.. Out of my car now... Get lost, bye... and never sit in it again! Moron! Where to madam? What do you want? Move ahead! Hey rickshaw...rickshaw. One two three four... One two three four One two... I've got mail... there is a vacancy... I would like to welcome... join company. Yes! Yes! Yes! Oye yes yes! Sir, it's a car not a cycle... Latest model. No dent, no scratch, hasn't run even a thousand miles. Your quotation is a shame for me... Make an offer I can't refuse... The car is in your garage... as soon as the money is in sir's pocket! ...Or else I can go to Mr. Bhalla. Yes Sir - Yes Mohit... I've called to inform you, an interview call has finally come. It had to...the application was filed so neatly. Neatly means nothing... My five page, mind-blowing bio-data must have impressed them. Anyway, reach home quickly. We have to start preparing for the interview. No Sir, not now... there's some crisis here... Ok... if you can't come, I'll come to your office.. No no... You don't come here. I'll do something Good, reach by 5. And look...thank you for all. Ok then. Yes Papa"- Mayera come home early today... Look, have I ever asked you to come home early? No, right! But today please reach home by 6, and no discussion on this. Or I will never speak to you again. Six means six. Bye bye bye. Radha! O radha - Yes papaji Order two chicken from the meat shop... and prepare the biryani spices... Mohit and Mayera are coming home for dinner... Alright! - And listen, make halwa as well. Gursharan...You know PC Jewelers right? Can you get me a discount? So meet me there! At the South Ex show room... in one hour... I'll call you back. Eighty eight thousand... with detailed accounts, date-wise. I've put in five thousand extra, just in case I've made a mistake. And if the mistake is of more than five thousand, just email. I'll you a draft. Where is the damn accounts slip? It's ok... I'll make a fresh one... I remember everything... What impression will my son-in-law have of me, if I give him such a ring? Show me a solid one, not these flimsy things. What are you doing madam, Sehgal Sir is secretary to Government of India IAS... Show us something worthy of his status. Where is your owner, call him... No no Sir, I'll show you... Take a look at this... Matching rings for the bride and groom. Yes, yes these are solo diamonds right... What are they called? - Sir solitaire.. Solitaire. solitaire. They are good. This will cost you around four and a half lakhs... No... Four and a half is too much... Show us something reasonable. No, do one thing... please pack these. Here! Please check... this includes the tickets of your stupid rock show... So I guess everything is cleared between us. All clear... Rock show is stupid because I wanted to go... and to be a cry baby like you and stay home is very clever. I don't want to be clever like you, I'm fine being stupid. And you know what, clever and stupid shouldn't get married either. Yes, as if I want to get married. In any case I can't afford the stupidity of love and marriage anymore. You know Gursharan - Yes sir! This boy that Mayera has chosen... His market value may be less, but his character is priceless... In my humble opinion, character is the only value sir. Today when I got the interview mail, I thought I've tested this boy enough... I should agree to their marriage... Correct thinking sir. But Mohit should never know I was praising him, how long does it take to get conceited, huh? Top secret sir. Now even this expensive ring seems reasonable for him... perfect matching. We are not made for each other. Tsck! Actually there isn't any point in meeting again. So I've not come to meet you, I've just come to return the money. Break-up. In fact I was going to say it first. Breakup! - Fine, you're first, I'm last...happy? Fine then get lost. You get lost This is my office Mohit, you get lost... Your office, your money... go to hell Mayera. Why do all answers, Seem unreliable. Nothing seems real, On these crossroads Except an imaginary indifference. Except an imaginary indifference. Except an imaginary indifference. This is the entire history of the company... Please put away the games and try to read it. Why should I read about them, are they taking my interview or am I taking theirs? When I had come to ask for Mayera's hand, I had done my complete home-work on you... so that I don't say anything that will make you reject me. Wow! You're very cool... Ok, I'm leaving now - Wait, wait... I'll get you a beer... - No Sir, I have to go to work... Beer is just a cold drink Please don't have a cold drink before your interview. Ok, do one thing.. you load the game, I'll just come. Load the game... Now where's this Mayera? Must be on her way... - It's six... I had told her to come early... How much longer can I delay Mohit... Aah...The smell of the halwa is irresistible... The thing is son, this is not a chilled beer, it's a child beer... Cheers! - Papa I am home We're here Mayera... Where are you off to? Mohit?!!! What the hell What are you doing in my house? L...l... - Hey, son of Romeo... your Juliet is here... Leave the window and come in... Papa please... - Shhh...quiet...nobody will speak, Only I will speak now... Radha! - Radha is at home? So where else will she be? C'mon Mohit, show some enthusiasm... Sit down both of you! Congratulations brother... Sister... Yoohoo...Surprise... Congratulations... One for you and one for you Take it, will you keep me standing like this? Tell me, do you like it? How do you like it, the rings? What? Someone say something... This is your probation's report card... you're not perfect, but we'll make do... Now before I change my mind, please make each other wear the rings... What's wrong? They're solitaires... Don't like the design? Ok, just wear them now for ceremony... Tomorrow you can go there and choose your own rings. Ok? So who wears the ring first, the boy or the girl? Why are you laughing? Papa...we are not getting married... She is serious It's over between us...all over.. Hey...sit, sit down! So I simply played all this squash, wasted my sweat, made enquiries in fifty departments... And do you know how many phone calls, photocopies, plastic files I've spent on...on this Mohit of your's? Not mine. Now I'm not going to investigate any other boy... Talk to each other, and resolve whatever this fight is about... Say sorry, and exchange rings...come on... Papa it's impossible. There's a huge gap between us now. Which can only be filled with a lot of money. Money that your daughter has, but I don't... Does anyone fight over money... Did you borrow money from him? Return it... I don't have any money for her to borrow... I haven't got a salary for three months... and the fact is, I am unemployed.. I'm looking for a job. You lost your airlines job? Oh bloody! You lost it then itself, right? I knew it...l knew it... You lied to me? - Yes... I lied to you... So now, should I make her wear the ring? Like hell you will! You've failed a 100%... 100% fail! You've lied, you liar! And you pretend to be Gandhi... you are lying to Mayera yourself... What lying? I'm trying for a job, he's helping me... Was helping me...was! You had promised me... Sister, halwa... Forget it Papa Please get rid of this job mania...ok? Mohit gone... mania gone! Driver, bring the car... - Excuse me sir... Come in Mayera. Sir is the Dubai position still open? You've taken too long silly... Dubai office has already got someone. Trust me I don't like that moron one bit. I wanted you there Mayera. But he's joining next week, if you can go before that... Can you leave tonight? The travel desk will arrange the visa.. Absolutely sir - Perfect! I say go there, work for a week do your magic If you are able to convince them there, I'll get all the approvals here. And once you get the appointment in Dubai, come back over the weekend to shift base properly. What say? I say Thank you thank you so much sir. But for now, just keep this to yourself... you are going on a regular assignment. What about Mohit? Mohit is history. What's going on? Hello sir...I'm Nawab Master... the driving instructor... I have a second hand business as well... just yesterday I sold Mohit sir's car at a top price... Call me if you have anything. Mohit?! Dude You sold your car! What's going on!? Ok so all accounts have been settled now... Where are you going? They're settled today, they'll be unsettled tomorrow... If I stay with you guys any longer who knows, I might begin to enjoy being unemployed... Mohit Mohit sorry. I swear I'll never read your newspaper... I'll never watch Big Boss... I'll pay for beer for the entire month...l swear... You can have my entire Playboy collection! The remote as well! Mohit... You coach your heart, Reproach your heart, Fool it into submission. If it's not broken, It's trust is not taken, Then why does it hurt so much... False concessions... Fake confessions... It hides all your mistakes... It fools others, And condemns itself, Looks for gain even in losses. Stupidities... Meaningless and pointless Needless and thoughtless... Unnecessary stupidities... Stupidities... Meaningless and pointless Needless and thoughtless... Unnecessary stupidities... Mr. Chaddha - Yes... Hi Mr. Chaddha - Hello. I'm really sorry All the positions have been taken... Why don't you leave your resume behind, we'll get back to you. No... thanks Ok...all the best. Your temper's still high, You show no improvement. You fall on your face all along. Not all is ï¬‚awed, Not all is lost, Then why is your face so long? You spend your days cursing others... Oh how stubborn you are!

Thank you sir... Negi...who are those couples at table 3 and 12? They've been occupying those tables for the last three hours... Get them out! - They're penniless lovers sir... Where will they go for their love talk? If they go home, parents will slap them... If they go to a park, cops will shoo them away... They're sitting here quietly cooing...let them... Why get into the business of love... when they're penniless! Yes Sir, boss's orders... I'll shoo these lave-birds away... Hey senior-most First put that stick aside... Give them a cappuccino each, and tell them they won't get anything for free after this! If they want to sit here, they'll have to spend... Or else, out in an hour...

It's her fault... she should say sorry...why should I? But Sir, just listen... Just talk to her once and see... Let's go Manju... Sir has a very bad temper! Hey let me just talk to him for a second... That liar! Jobless... ...dependent on Mayera for the last two months! I should have sent him to jail! Don't know why I'm so confused about him... Sir, the Government never respected your goodness... transfer upon transfer... But God is watching Sir, he saved you and our Mayera at the last minute... No more scope for confusion. Tell madam to give me whatever money is due for these rings... Sir patience sir patience... But I didn't understand one thing... Once he had broken up with Mayera, why did he go out of his way to help you? Logically speaking, he shouldn't have... I think it's a big conspiracy Sir... In my humble opinion, pull some strings and send him to jail... Gursharan Singh! What an opinion. Sir your luck is very good, gold prices have shot up... You've made a profit of thirty seven thousand, five hundred and eighty rupees... Thirty seven thousand... Why did my luck have to change today? Bloody! I don't want to sell... thanks a lot for your assistance... Sir - Sir You raised one question and cleared the entire matter... couldn't you have done this earlier? I wouldn't have had to bear such a big loss. Sir what question did I raise sir? He had made me a promise... and how could he break his promise? He came to help me even after the break up... Wow! Look at the character of that guy... How can I leave a guy with such a fine character? Sir anyone can get a character certificate by paying extra money... but the boy is jobless. Yes he's jobless, but he taught me that life doesn't end but starts at sixty... That duffer made me, what is that, cool... He made me cool! He's an MBA, sooner or later he'll get a job... That's ok Sir... but.. The thinking of the boy and girl doesn't match yours... They are fighting... Gursharan, have Romeo and Juliet ever come together without the villain? No sir - No! This time as well the villain will unite them. Mayera! - Where were you? I've been trying your phone for so long! Give me the keys, I need your passport... Passport? Why? What? - Just hear me out...sit here... What is this? Our new house, in Dubai... Our new house? Yes papa.. It's a 4 bedroom apartment... A kitchen that's bigger than our living room, fully equipped. Meet Mayera Sehgal papa... new vice president of the Dubai office... Double the salary, that too in Dirham... See, I did what you wanted! What?! Now don't say you don't want to go... because you don't have a choice... No silly... I'm in shock, with happiness... It's the best decision of your life... Here are the keys... But we have to pack up the house in two days, if I don't join on Monday the offer will be cancelled.. Don't worry, I'm there... I'll do what's correct for you... That Mohit, that useless Mohit... Imagine if you'd gotten married to him, would you have been able to move to Dubai? Radha, did you get the cartons? Yes... Don't worry, we won't leave without taking our revenge... I have told Gursharan to make a fake case against him and send him to Tihar jail... Papa are you mad? First they will break his bones with the Tihar sticks, that'll really be breaking Mr. Mohit up! What fun! You're just too much! Call Gursharan Uncle right now... Stop him, come on... Will you feel bad if that rogue is in pain? If you love him so much, why are you running away to Dubai? I'll get out of your way... Now you're getting confused, should I go to Dubai or not... To be or not to be... Romeo and Juliet... There's no confusion... I just don't want any new problem to come up and keep us behind... Talk to Gursharan uncle... Yes Gursharan Tihar-plan cancelled... Happy? Hey Gursharan my friend... nobody has to be sent to Tihar... Now listen to me, Mayera has taken both our passports to Ajanta Travels for the tickets and visa... You have to set up something at the travel agency so that we don't get the visas... Now you understand? Yes, we shouldn't get the visas! Good... Yes! Come on Mohit, answer the phone... Oh hell! Now how do I contact this duffer? You sir...? - Yes. Sir...Mohit was just here... I think he's gone to the conference room... Will you keep lying all your life, to save your friend? Not lying... Where is he? Tell me the truth. He's changed his number, doesn't reply to emails... I don't know Sir, he's just disappeared... Think! There must be someone who can tell us about him... Think carefully, the Home Secretary was my batch mate! By God, what happened to Mohit was very unfortunate... I tried to tell him, don't show off your automatic car, who knows you may not have even a cycle tomorrow! He didn't listen to me... But where is he? Stop bro, stop...Sir over there... Very good...Thank you Master. Ok lmmy, thank you... - Welcome sir. Hey waiter! Bloody good! How can I help you sir? Do you get a salary, or are you on daily wages? Which coffee sir? Hmm, get me a Cappuccino... and a cup of tea for you. It's on me... No thanks... One cappuccino please! Anything else? How about a brownie Let me help increase your sales, you must be getting a commission huh? Bring it out please. Let the love never be less, I will take every other loss... Let the love never be less... I will take every other loss... Hey boy! What shoddy service is this? Clean the damn table! Take it... You can get your new girlfriend peanuts with it... And this time look for someone who is of your status. Why have you come here? To tell you that Mayera is moving to Dubai. It hurts doesn't it? How you both used to boast... "We can eat love, we can wear love" "we can fill love in the petrol tank and drive off..." So where is all that love? Now do you understand the value of money? As always, Mayera is smarter than you.. She's taken a transfer to Dubai... In a week's time Dubai will make her forget the pain, and you... You just keep selling your tea coffee here... You think you're very smart, but you're just a big duffer! Don't you understand Mayera is spoilt... She's gotten used to the 5 Star life... You should be happy the marriage didn't happen, she would have made you bankrupt! See, as soon as you lost your money, that snob tossed you aside like an insignificant fly! You're calling your own daughter a snob? Why are you feeling bad? What does she mean to you now? Anyway, she's dumping you and going... that too in business class! After this, don't ever let yourself fall in love with a money-minded, selfish, opportunist like Mayera... Enough Mr. Sehgal! This is too much.. You've said enough... Now if you say even one word against Mayera I'll... You'll what? What will you do? The Romeo passion doesn't go well with empty pockets... You flaunt your love like you're some millionare but you're just a bloody waiter!! We're leaving for the airport in about three hours... understood? If I see you within a five kilometer radius of the airport... remember, the Home Secretary is my batch mate! Excuse me! Your photo will go to the home department... Then it will flash to every PCR van, Black Cats, NSG commandos, CRPF, RAW agents... Don't you ever mess with us and stay away from my daughter! Bloody waiter! She's moving to Dubai... She could have at least told me that! Sir there's no point in being sad right now... Just go say sorry to ma'am, and stop her from leaving. How can I just go and apologize to her? She's the one who broke up first. She'll have to say sorry first. Sir it's not a race... If you're going to let your ego become as big as an airplane, Ma'am will simply fly away! And you'll be left wondering forever Bloody waiter... Sir, that old man has insulted all of us... You've to give it back to that rotten fellow! Yes Sir, steal Mayera away from right under his nose... That will be a fitting reply. Are you done with the lecturing? Enough of me and my life... get back to work. Sir please listen to me... - I said get back to work!! Hey! Stop right here... Yes...Stop... How much? - Forty five sir... Keep the change... Where were you papa? Hurry up and get ready or we will get late... I'll just get ready... Gursharan done? - Ma'am please sign here... No, not done sir. Not done what? - What done? Not done? What? No nothing... Go inside! Ma'am your passports with Dubai Visa and tickets. Radha, you've latched all the windows properly right? Yes! - And switched off the gas? I have... - Ok alright! Give all your papers to Gursharan uncle... And come here to clean up every Saturday, otherwise I won't come back to get you... Sis, don't go please... Why are you crying? I'm coming back to get you, ok? Please don't go sis... - Stupid girl! I will miss you a lot... Ok now stop crying and take all the bags out, ok? Sir in my humble opinion What do we do about the rings? I've never abused so much in my life... I called my own daughter proud... I tell you, these two are more stubborn than me... I don't know whether gold prices are up or down now... but sell them irrespective of whether they fetch a profit or loss! And deposit the money in my account... I guess this time too Romeo and Juliet will have a tragic end. Sir, - What? Sir, please come here... - What's the matter? Sir see! - What? Now let's make sure he doesn't go free! Gursharan pick up a weapon! Wait Sir, I'm coming too... - No, you wait here... Sir that mad old man is dangerous... I know, but after all he is my father-in-law... Careful sir Brother Mohit Beware! Don't you dare take a single step, or I'll handicap you... Gursharan call the Police Commissioner... Yes Sir! The Home Secretary... - Yes, I know, he's your batch-mate. But I don't want to talk to you... Call Mayera... Call her... Mayera, Mayera... Mayera... Why should Mayera come? Who are you, just a waiter? First earn some money, have a bank balance... My Mayera won't go with a loser... She's come to her senses now, you bloody penny-pincher! Sir reality check... You're behaving very, very uncool right now Sir... Insulting my waiter friends, uncool" Calling Mayera proud, uncool... And your hundred year old money-theory, that's uncool too... If one followed your theory, the poor would not be allowed to love or live... If there is love, thirty rupees and one cup of coffee... is enough to be happy... What if there's no money, there's unlimited love... Money or no money, loves finds it's way... Where there's love, there's a way... She hates you... And you must know, we were going to pray at the hanuman temple on the way to the airport... that you are never happy in life... You bloody loser... - Papa enough What has Mohit done to you? He agreed to the probation... He lost all the matches with you... He's the national level under-16 silver medalist in squash... yet he lost all matches for you... He helped you with your job-hunting... lied to me for you... He calls you Osama, but you're not less than a terrorist... he kept tolerating you, for me... The man who can do so much for me, can also give his life for me... Waiter or manager, pauper or prince, I love him... Some sacrifices will have to be made... I won't get to go to rock shows, dinner once a month, shopping once a year... Hey hey...I'm not going to work at a coffee shop all my life... Until you do... We will still have fun... Without you I don't enjoy shopping at all, whatever the credit card limit... Because when you're not around, there's nobody to say... Very hot...shall I gobble you up! Hey...no hanky-panky here... all this after marriage... What's going on dad? Weren't you very happy with our break-up? Your generation always has to do the opposite of what the parents say... It's always the case... Papa you are crazy if I had listed his good qualities would you say sorry and patch up with him? No! I abused him only then did you understand... Hey, Stupid! You call me uncool, you bloody fool! If you want to be my son-in-law take my blessings... Not like this, give me hug... A good one... Stupid fellow... Come here! Now give the rings... Your wish means everything, and mine means nothing... Which wish? Today is my interview... I have to go there... Rings can wait... - Papa! Let him go, otherwise he will never leave us alone... He won't be able to take the pressure of a private job at his age. He's letting you decide for yourself... Let him do the same... Dear in my humble opinion, he's right... Ok...fine guys. So...how am I looking? Don't you have a suit? - Suit. I got a new Safari suit made for this, from Singh Tailors... four pockets. Suit and tie please! - Oh bloody Where are you taking me? - Come on, come on... Gursharan I am being kidnapped... - C'mon! Oh wait, you guys have sandwiched me in between! The sandwich needs a good tie! Hello Unni sir I love you too much... I can't leave you and go to Dubai... How crowded this place is... come on guys...come on... You'll shift out of this hole in the wall after marriage, wont you? Say sorry sir...l take of fence... Say sorry sir or no tie... Sorry, bro sorry! Please get me sober tie, according to my age... Young and dynamic sir. Where are you going? - He'll get something silly... Ok, choose a good one... I missed you. - I know man, where were you... Osama - Crap! Killer! Sir don't show off in the interview, that the home Secretary is your batch mate... It'll give a good impression... you won't understand... Papa, it doesn't make a difference to anyone... Really, - Yeah! I thought that's why Mohit is scared of me... You're not scared of me? Hey duffer... Don't scare anyone. You're going for an interview, not to pick a son-in-law... I know ya... I'm your father you are not my father. Sehgal VK - They're asking for your name... not for your email ID! - Vinod Kumar Sehgal... VK Sehgal - This way sir. Sir your GF is top class... I agree Peter Top class coffee for top class GF... Sir, take one cup... and share Idea! Your financing skills, and my marketing... lets open a coffee shop.. I've understood one thing from all this... even if they have no money, people don't stop drinking coffee... Brilliant...and we will call it One Cup Coffee... No ya... - Why not?! Then people will drink only one cup! Listen, I will keep the name... The home Secretary is my papa's batch-mate ok! I'm going to gobble this Home Secretary up... Osama... Oh no.. papa.. Don't worry its ok Meet the new CEO of the company Sehgal VK! Oh my god that's amazing. Wow that's so cool! Sehgal Sir so proud of you. Oh duffer, my son-in- law.
