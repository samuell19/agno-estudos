Dineo, my friend. Home girl. Nick, Nick. Didn't you say HR gave you a warning regarding cultural appropriation in the workplace? - HR? I am the... - "Who's the boss?" - That doesn't make sense. - Listen. Are you ready to wow DJ Fresh with a social media plan for his Fresh Protein shake? Yay! - What a shitty name. - So shitty. - That's... - Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Dineo Mudau. - Yes. Yes, that's me. - Oh! Oi. All right. It's from Simphiwe, you guys. - My boyfriend. - What happened to Themba? He ghosted her three months ago. - You know I can hear you, Pam? - Yep. You know what? Do me a favor... and livestream this. Okay. Go. - So... - Sorry. - Hang on. - Okay. It's the... okay. - So, you guys... - Whoa! - Oh, Pam, come on. - Sorry. It's... - Pam. - Go! You guys, my boyfriend just surprised me at work for Valentine's Day! I mean, talk about hashtag, love lives here. Right? Let's see. Toiletry bag? I never gave my girlfriend a toiletry bag. Oh! He's surprising me with a getaway, a weekend thing or something! That's amazing! That's amazing! Sorry, my sister. - Sister. - Yeah, what? I think it's longer than a weekend. Gents! Home girl... Did you just get dumped on Valentine's Day? Uh, turn that off, Pam. - You're getting loads of comments. - Turn it off. Turn it off, Pam, now! I can't believe I suffered lockjaw for two days for this shit! How... Pam? - Hmm? - Don't tell me you're still recording. No. Pam! Shit! Hey, do you work for Lumka and Johnson Accounting? - No. - Good. Then we have clearance from HR. I think we should go back to your place. Yeah? Give me a second. Eish! And then? Didi? Didi? Didi? - Friend, I think I ate something bad. - I've heard you take a shit. - That's not what you sound like. - You don't know everything. So you're not on Simphiwe's profile? - No. - Babe, - give me your phone. - No! I didn't bring you to an office party to spend the whole night in the toilet. I didn't want to come to this stupid party anyway. Friend, you're so ungrateful. - Don't you wanna get laid? - I want love. Okay? Maybe a little lay. You won't get any of that from a toilet seat, so get your ass out here so we can get you on your back and get you laid. Laid. I think your hands are clean now, Mam' Thandi. Friend, it's been three weeks. You need to get over it. I can't. Noni, I can't, okay? He was the love of my life, you know? And we were gonna get married. You were together for two months. It was two and a half months and you know it. - Give me your phone. - No. - What? You think I won't go in there? - Hey! Hey! Leave me! Didi, you forget I'm older than you! Learn to respect your elders! Didi... Noni, you know what? No... - No, we're too old for this. - Yes. I agree. If this is spiked, my ancestors are gonna come after you. I don't need to do that to get a girl. Ugh! You men. You men don't get how hard we love. - What do you mean? - Yes. - We love hard. - Oh... - We love hard when it's the right girl. - Right! Right, I was the right girl. I was, and then he just dumped me anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're not supposed to talk about your old man with your new man. - With whose man? - No. Not that you... Not that you're the new man. I just meant, like... I... Okay, my best friend Noni, she's been telling me to get back on my bounce-back game. - Okay. - And I guess you're bounceable. - Wow. Okay. - No, no, no, no, no. Not sex bounce, rebound bounce. Although that didn't sound... - I'm sorry. - You asking me to have sex with you? 'Cause I will. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here you go. - Here you go. Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Why would you say that? - Why wouldn't I? - Steve Harvey says, "If you wanna keep a guy, you shouldn't sleep with him on the first night." Oh... Okay, tell me, how's that working out for you so far? Mmm. So... I mean, what are you trying to say? Do you stick around long after you've slept with a girl? I mean, it's not about the sex. You know, sometimes relationships aren't meant to last. So we should enjoy them while we can. Hmm. Right? Mmm-hmm. You have little bit of, uh... okay. - Got it? - Yeah, got it. It was great meeting you. Friend. Ah! I can already see you naming your babies. - I'm not naming anything. - Mmm. But Lunga Junior sounds cute. His friends will call him LJ, Noni. The only LJ you should be thinking about's the one in his pants. Yeah, that's your style, not mine. Fine. In that case, let's go home. I think I've made out with everyone I can make out with here. Wait. - Yeah, I'm done here. - Noni... is he your client? Does he have a girlfriend? No, actually, what's his tax bracket? Yes, I don't know, and none of your business. Let's go. No, you go. Bye. Okay. Well, you better BJ that LJ. You know... What are you looking at? Whatever. Leave me alone. What? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Where are you taking me? - You're gonna love it, trust me. - I'm gonna love it. - Be careful. - Okay. Oh, wow. What? Wow. - Yeah. - Yeah. You know what? Just, let me... - All right. - Hold that. Okay. Just... Proof... that I'm having a good time. Whoa, no, no, no. You don't have to prove anything to him. - Really? - Mystery is more effective. Right. Clearly you've never had your heart broken. - I mean, I've had bad breakups. - That's a no. And what? What, you can just... move on? Why hold on to the past when your future could be standing right in front of you? That's what you want, don't you? You know... I... I don't sleep with just anyone. I want someone to come home to. Is that Steve Harvey again? You say you want someone to come home to? I say it's better to have someone to go home with. What? Just... Mom said you're stuffing your mouth with food. God. Ow! Noni, this is not a good time. Where the hell are you? Wait. You have been placed on hold. Please wait. What? Where the hell are you? You told me to sleep with him. - So I slept with him. - You shouldn't still be there! No one should be in anyone's bed at this time! Wait. Why are you yelling? Just come home, okay? Hi, handsome. No, Dineo. Hey. How did you... No. Morning! You got this. Hey! Hey. You're such a typical bachelor. Nothing in your fridge. But lucky for you, - I know a very great, nice... - Oh, shit! What? I have a flight boarding in an hour. - Well, can't you change your flight? - I can't. I have a... a work thing. Oh! Well... What is this? What? Are you kicking me out? Uh, no, no, no. You... No, I'm sorry. You stay. Just, uh... leave the keys with security. Okay, when will you be back? Uh, tomorrow night. Wait, will I... will I see you again? Lunga? I really wish we had more time. Okay, go. Go, you're gonna miss your flight. Bye! Pictures of him sleeping is an eight on the stalker scale. It's not stalking if we've had sex. You know, it was supposed to be a one-night stand like mine. But with less piercings. We need to stop doing that, by the way. You really... Aren't you, like, 45 now? Piss off. - Okay, sorry, 50. - Hey. I'm a chartered accountant living her best life and I don't need anyone to fund it. Bitch, I'm killing 35. I don't know. That doesn't keep you warm at night. Oh, there's a whole world of men for that, and some women, too. There's only one man I want. You don't even have his phone number. I have these. This one's getting a restraining order against you. I'll have to sleep with the Minister of Police for you. - Oh, just for me? - Yeah. - Not because you want to? - No, he's cute, but hashtag, contre-jour. Friend! - Shit, this is good. - It's good? - Easy now. - It's not... Oh, friend. Do you choke on your guys the way you choke on smoke? Hey! Who's in there? I have a lethal weapon that I'm not afraid to use. It's me! - It's me. - Shit! What... what are you doing here? I thought you'd be hungry after your flight, so I cooked you dinner. I didn't say you could move in. I... I didn't move in. Okay. - Dineo. - Hmm? This? This was a one-time thing. I don't under... I don't understand. I thought you said that you wished we had more time. And I told you that I don't sleep with just anybody, so... Every girl says that. Wow. So now I'm a squatter and I'm a ho. No, I'm not... That's not what I mean. All I'm saying is... Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a full chicken, woman. It's not the food's fault. I was just saying... Are these takeaway boxes? I thought you said you cooked. Take... pfft! So... Okay, so I was a squatter, a ho, and now I can't cook. - You are just on a roll. - I didn't say any of that. Listen, listen, listen... I didn't say any of that. I'm just saying... Okay, okay. Dineo, I'm just saying, if you came home, okay, and found some guy in your flat, - how would you feel? - Lucky. That I have pepper spray in my bag. - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Right? I get it. I'll go, and you can... eat. And this thong was bugging me anyway. Wait, wait, wait. No, let's not... Wait, don't go. I mean... You know, I just... Uh, I mean, you've made all this effort. We shouldn't, you know... We shouldn't let all this go to waste. Right? - Right. - Yeah, and, I mean, if... if that thong is annoying you, I can do something about that. Yeah. - You know what? We should actually stop. - Sorry. - Sorry. - We... yeah. We should definitely... We should stop. I mean, we could stop tomorrow. Yep. Tomorrow, yeah... I was actually gonna say tomorrow. - 'Cause tomorrow... Yeah. - Tomorrow... - That's it. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow works. - Tomorrow.

So, Mr. DJ Fresh's team called about the campaign again. - Shit! - Yeah, my thoughts exactly. So I think we're gonna try and reschedule the presentation to, I don't know, the first week of June. Pam, I need your FB logins. Did you hear anything I said? You say a lot, but what you're not telling me is your FB login, so... I'm not on social media. You work at a whole social media agency.

Wait. - Come on. Hurry. - What's going on? - No wonder he dumped you. - He must be sick of you. He didn't dump me, wena. He married someone else. Big difference. Shame. You're gonna die alone. - Let's go. - Your mother will die alone! Bitch! Your mother is a bitch. No, let's go, Noni. Hey, good morning. I've been thinking, friend. "Good morning, Noni. You look gorgeous today." Thank you. I think I'm done with this dating random guys thing. Every guy was random until you started dating them. That was different. I knew they were the right man. Hmm, until they started ghosting you. Or cheating on you. Or saying they're not ready for a relationship... Okay, I get it. I get it. Noni, the point is I tried your way and I failed. So... So now I've downloaded an online dating app. - Friend, you hate those. - Just be happy for me, Noni. I'm trying, right? I'm putting myself out there. I think this is the only way I'm actually gonna get over Lunga. Okay. Hey, but easy on that left hook, Mayweather. You know what? Come, come, help me set up my profile. I'd rather dig my eyes out. What was happening between you and Max last night? Nothing. There's no me and Max anything. What do you mean, "nothing"? What do you... Take a picture that accentuates your cheekbones. Huh? For your online dating profile. You should take a picture from that angle. Oh! Oh. - Okay. - And just... - Take it on an angle. - Yeah. - Okay, come help me. - Uh-uh. Late for work. The editors will be done with the mock-ups by the end of week. Now, that's the woman I know and love. Look, Nick, I know I've been distracted lately, but... But? Uh, but I'm committed. I am committed to making this campaign work. And we'll be launching on all social media platforms as soon as DJ Fresh gives us the go-ahead. Yes! You have secured the bag on this one. You are booked and busy. My slay queen, my slayer. Slay me! - Dineo. - I'm sorry. I mean, I'm just excited. I'm excited about this campaign. It's Fresh... This is DJ Fresh. He's... I mean, he's the dog. Right? Doggy dog. Whoo, whoo! You can't drop the ball on this, Dineo. You're the best I have. But mess up again and you're fired. DJ Fresh is only going to believe that you had a stomach bug once. Right. I promise no more distractions. I'm getting my life back together. - Yes! - You're my home girl. Come on. So, tell me about yourself. Is your dad's name "Oliver"? Mmm-mmm. 'Cause you gonna be all over this dick. You know, Dineo's been on, like, 11 dates. And each of them has been an epic fail. But every time she goes, she believes that that guy could be the guy. That's crazy, right? I have this policy. I haven't slept with a guy more than once in a long time. Okay? I've been very clear about this with every man I've slept with, and none of them have challenged me on it. Except you. Continue, I'm listening. You're really not going to help me? I wouldn't expect you to help with my clients' taxes, so no. Well, I could. Oh, please. I doubt whatever bartending course you did qualifies you. I studied business and commercial law. Look at you now. You think I'm hot. Oh, please. So why are you mopping floors? You see, law was my dad's thing... so I finished the course and once I was done, I traveled to Asia, the Caribbean, I taught English... I tended bars. Now that I'm back, I want to start my own nonprofit aimed at sustainable development throughout the continent. Your dad must be so proud. My dad and I aren't on speaking terms, but I have faith. Like my mom and I. Not because of anything specific. We just literally have nothing in common. Why don't you? She did everything by the book, and I'm the family cautionary tale. My dad, he'd kill to have a son like you. Yeah, but when you're a woman, you know success isn't enough, right? No, child, no ring, no happiness. No child, no ring... looks beautiful to me. Fine. I will help you clean. Yeah. Finally. Here you go, you're going to need that. And you're going to need that. Excuse you, I do not do mops. And the last time I was on my knees was varsity, okay? - Okay. - Cloth. - Cloth. - Thank you. There you have it. I'll take the mop. Welcome. Thank you. Well, I thought... Okay. - Is that what we're doing? - That's what's up. ♪ Look at this situation How are we going to handle it? ♪ ♪ My darling ♪ ♪ It's yours and mine ♪ ♪ I'm scared ♪ - Where have you been? - Shit. Oh, you scared the bejesus out of me! Why are you sitting in the dark? Friend. What happened? Hey, did he hurt you? It was a threesome, Noni. With another guy. Oh, and he wasn't cute? How is this not surprising you? Threesomes are more common than you think. I mean, I've been approached, like, what? Three times, and usually by some older couple from Germany. Well, they were black. Well, black people are progressive too, man. Stay woke. Is this what it really means to be single? Really? Like, creeps, and threesomes, and God knows what? Yep. But it's also freedom. Having a place of your own. Hanging out with your best friend. How is... How is this enough for you? Why isn't it enough for you? I don't want to be single. Come here. I'm here. Okay, fine. I'll marry you. Friend. Will you come look at them with me? Oh, what are you... - Are these for you? - Yeah. It's time to get my own place, right? - Yeah, but, friend, last night... - Yeah, I know. I know, I think saying it out loud made me realize that you're right, friend. You're right. I should get a place of my own. And I need to start focusing at work before I get another warning. - So, basically, I'm doing me now. - You sure? No. But at least we'll be single together, right? - Right? - Yeah. - I thought you'd be excited about this. - I am. Hey! It's you and me forever, right? - Forever. Forever. - Forever. Perfect non-date. - Don't say it like that. - Like what? Like it's a date. No pressure. I already had sex with you. Goal achieved. - You are so going down. - Oh, I am? Your place or mine? Stop it. That throw... No, that was not... That's... I get a second chance. Okay. Whoo! So, this apartment isn't big, but it's economical. Like a shoe box. You're supposed help, Noni. Be helpful, Noni. If we go to the bedroom you'll find... Hey, sorry I'm late, I got caught... - Oh, shit. - Got caught up. - I'll wait for you guys to finish. - No, no, no. No, no. This... This is him, girls and boys. This... This is the man who dates other women while he's engaged to somebody else. See, now everybody will get to see who you really are, Lunga. - It's still in selfie mode. - Hmm? Right! Because I meant to do that. Because he doesn't deserve to be on my social media. - Shall we do the dramatic exit? - Yes. Flick hair. No, no, actually... Actually... There's this one thing, this one thing I've been meaning to say to you. It's gonna sting. So, you're not getting the apartment? Shit. Um... - If I could show you the bedroom... - Yeah. - Right this way. It's beautiful. - Let's go. - Shh. - Why? What's going... - Where is she? - She's sleeping. - Sleeping? - Sleeping. Finally, she's sleeping. Oh! Shh, shh. Shit, the remote. Where is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Press the red button. - I'm trying. - Press it. Okay. Cool, cool. - It's off. Shit, she's up. Quick! Hide! - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - What's up? Can't sleep? Mmm, yeah. No, it's... Stupid work stuff's just stressing me out. - Do you want me to come stay up with you? - No, no, no. No. Uh... I smoked a joint, babe. Think I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. - Okay. - Okay, friend. - Okay. Good night. - Good night, friend. She's gone, right? She's gone. We're going... - Hello, Mama. - Hello, my baby girl. - Come in, come in. - Thank you. Hey, Mama V. - Uh, Nolusi... - Noni, Mama. Okay. Um, so, Mama, can I offer you some tea, coffee? - Blood? - Uh... Tea and coffee in this heat? My baby, it's so hot outside. You know, winters used to be longer. Yeah. So tell me, how long are you gonna be staying here this time? Not too long. Not too long, Mama, I promise. And where is that boy you went on a date with? Is he also staying in a commune? You know it's just me and Noni who live here, right? Exactly. That's a commune. Always such a pleasure to see you. Don't you have trays in this house? Anyway... Mama, I've been thinking... Maybe it's time I should get my own place. What's wrong, Mama? What's wrong, Mama? Dineo... Dineo... Do you want to kill me? How many times have I told you men don't want women with their own homes? Then they really aren't men, are they, Mama? Wow, look who's talking. The unmarried one. Look, you're not like her. You still stand a chance to get out of this situation. Mama... Mama, you've been alone for a long time, right? Look at yourself. You're fine. - Fine? - Yes. - Fine? - Yes. I'm fine because of the hope that one day you're going to get married and give me cute little grandkids. Cute grandkids? Uh-uh, Mama. Hey, Mama V, you are way too young to be a grandmother. - My goodness. - Don't flatter me like that. Let's talk about this, my child. Just imagine a pretty lady like yourself spending her life alone in her flat, staring at the walls. Uh-uh, girl. Find a good husband who's going to take care of you and you can buy your dream house together, you know? Yes. Cheers to that. Cheers. Thank you. Does your wife know that you're here? No. So, are you gonna... Are you gonna cheat on her with me? That's up to you. That was a joke. That was a joke. I'm... That was a bad one. I'm sorry. Um... - I was gonna call you. It's just... - You know... I wanted to explain to you... I got divorced. What? Um, that's... That's why I was flat-hunting. Too many memories at my place. Of what? Of living with me while you were engaged to her, hmm? Okay. Can we not just do this here? Can we not... No, no, no. Actually, this is... This is perfect because you seem to forget that I actually walked in on your bachelor party. So I think this is fair, right? This is perfect, so... My goodness. Lunga, what? You were on a roll. You got divorced, and then what? You have the floor. Everyone's listening. Okay, I... I made a mistake. Dineo, I want you. That's why I'm here. But I thought you said that we were just two people having... What's the word? "Fun." That's what you said, right? No, I was wrong. And you were right. You were right. I fell for you. Hey, I fell for you. That's why I didn't tell you the truth and why I kept seeing you when I shouldn't have. I am in love with you. Come to me, baby. You can be mine.

I love you. - You love me? - I love you. - Since when? - Dineo, look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for what happened. Gugu and I had an open relationship while she was... Listen. We did. We tried to make it work, but it's hard to give up on something you've built for seven years. You know what? It's a great story. I just don't see where I come in. Dineo, you... You're the one that I'm meant to come home to. ♪ Too late for sorry It's over, king ♪ ♪ I tried to fix it But I end up coming back home alone ♪ ♪ She says, "Too late for sorry" It's over, king ♪ ♪ I tried to fix it But I end up coming back home alone ♪ ♪ She says, "Too late for sorry" ♪ Okay.

Please, no. - She was helping to check my tonsils. - Yes. What? Yeah, I mean, your tongue is so long and beautiful, - and I love it. Technically... - Stop talking. She's your friend. She deserves to know the truth. - Your friend is gone. - Dineo! Didi! No, wait, Didi. Didi. Babe, don't make me run in heels. You know I don't know how. - Come on. - Noni, why wouldn't you tell me about him? I didn't want you to feel bad, you know. - 'Cause you're... - What? - What? Because I'm what? - 'Cause you're single. Wow! There it is. Know what you've become? Those "couple" women you hate. What? We aren't even a couple! We're just... - I like him... - Me and Lunga had ice cream. He's getting divorced and wants me back. - And you said no? - Yeah, I said no. Because you wanted to. Noni, what if he's the one? What if? You know, love is complicated, right? Grow up. He's not the one. - Why are you doing this? - Because... Because if you're with Max, then I really am alone. I'm not "with Max." Noni, you've slept with him more than once.

At least this way, we get to just drink and walk back to the flat, right? And hopefully there won't be, like, a road block on the way. To the... Yes, drinks. Yo, hey. There you go. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. Listen, bring a lot of alcohol, okay? Okay, great, great. - I want to make a toast. - A toast? - Yeah. - Yes. Uh, to second chances... and new beginnings. And our first double date. - Hey. There. - Cheers to that. Ouch. And I want to make a toast to you, Dineo. I know I don't deserve you... Um, but thank you for loving me anyway. And for bringing us all together. And, Noni, thank you for agreeing to this. You know what? If Dineo's happy, Noni's happy. You don't need to speak for me. Then maybe you should say something. Oh, thank you. How could you not tell her you were engaged? Noni. I meant what happened in soccer this weekend. That's between us two. Are you pro-Israel or pro-Palestine? You know, mild topics. But it wasn't between you two when you married someone else. And it wasn't between you two when I had to pick her up off the floor because she was so drunk and her heart broken over you. Why'd you have to say that? Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. I think we should go up next. You know I don't do the stage. We'll go. We'll go. - Yes? - Yes, let's go, let's go. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, okay. Couple goals. Whose side are you on? I'm on your side, of course. But if you go on like this, you'll lose your friend. Oh. Cheaters always stick together. - Okay, I am not Lunga. - You're all Lunga.

These guys don't love you, okay? They use you and then they throw you away, and you let them. That sounds more like you than me, but okay. Please. No one uses me. Really? You? You? You getting drunk and hooking up with every Tommy, Doomy and Harry that you meet? Friend, you're not going to be young and beautiful forever. And then what? What will you be left with, hmm? My self-respect. For not settling for trash. How can you call it "respect" when the only difference is you don't get paid for it? Noni, that didn't... I... Friend, I didn't mean that. Do what you always do, okay? Take your things. Move in with him. But this time... don't come back, because now I'm done. Noni... Noni... It's gonna be okay. - Are you sure it's okay if I stay here? - Yeah. Come here. Look, I don't want you to ever leave again. Okay?

Why wouldn't he tell me his parents are here? Oh, they're here for your surprise party. What... what... what surprise? For me? Baby. Honey, this is amazing. You don't call him "honey." Why are you dancing? What? This is for me? For me? This is just amazing. What is this? Oh, my God, you guys. This is... Okay. Keep following. Almost there. - I'm fine. Okay. Okay. - You're good, you're good. - What's happening? - There you go. Surprise! Oh, my goodness! Wow! - Happy birthday, baby. - I'm so surprised. Mom, Dad, this is Dineo. - Hello, Dineo. - Uh... Hello, Mama. Nice to meet you. You, too. So nice to meet you. - Mama. - Yes, my baby. You know what? You are so lucky to have a man like him. My future son-in-law. Oh, my goodness. You know, he does things in style. Let me just go check on something with the manager quickly. Okay. I'm so glad, Duri, you are back together again. - You found each other again. - Mmm. Now you can buy that big house ya lona, the dream house. Together. - Together? - Yes. This man is going to look after you, my child. He's not like your father. - He's committed, and I can tell. - Ah, Mama. Um... A few of Lunga's friends want to meet Didi, so I'm gonna steal her for a few minutes. Yes. Right. - But who are all these people? - I have no idea. I'm actually surprised you came. Well, someone has to keep you sane around your mother. - Yeah. - You look like a Stepford wife. Noni, I'm so sorry. Friend... Dineo, baby, can you please come stand here next to me? Okay. Yeah, Dineo, come. - What is happening? - Um... Firstly, I, uh... I want to thank you all for joining us here today. Um... Dineo and I have been through a lot as a couple. And having you all here to celebrate with us today means so much. We've, uh... Yeah, we've had a few bumps on the road. Yeah, so, um... Right now I just want to make sure that we we never lose each other again. Oh, shit. Everyone take out your phones, 'cause if we miss this, she'll kill us. Oh, my child. Dineo Mudau. You fight for love even when it seems impossible. You take care of me. You make me a better man. And I hope you'll keep doing that for the rest of our lives. Will you marry me? Say yes. Okay, put your phones away. Uh, Dineo... So proud of my girl. Champagne. Dineo. Dineo, what are you doing? What are you doing? What's going on? What the hell was that? I followed you last night. To the hotel. I followed you, and I know it's crazy, but I thought I was gonna walk in on your bachelor party. Except it's not crazy, because that's exactly what happened. I walked in on your bachelor party, - and you married somebody else. - That was then. That was then. That's my past. I am here with you now. - You say you love me, right? - Yeah. But you never called me. - Does it matter? - Yes, it does. - Does it really matter? - It does! When... When in the entire time that we've known each other have you shown me that you want me? - Not a fill-in girlfriend. - Uh... Not somebody who takes care of you, Lunga. Just me. Just me, Dineo. Three minutes ago, Dineo. Three minutes ago when I got on one knee and I asked you to marry me. Which is three months after you got divorced, right? Right. I'm not in love with you. I'm not. I'm in love with not being alone. Didi? Dineo. I don't deserve you, friend. Shut up. Oh! Lunga's failed proposal has gone viral, and you're no longer Desperate Bae. Ugh. Oh, God, I can't believe I did that. Oh, you slayed emotional dragons today, friend. You should be so proud. Noni, being single is fine, right? Yeah. Sure as hell beats losing the right guy 'cause you're an idiot. So bar boy is the right guy? You know what? You know what? If I can turn down a marriage proposal today, then you, my friend... - You can go win your man back. - Mmm. Okay. Tomorrow. I think we've had enough excitement for one day. No, today. Now, actually. - Uh-uh, friend. - Yes. I've cleaned my face and everything. You can do it in five minutes... and he doesn't care. Let's go. Let's go. I hope you guys are having a lovely evening. - Okay. - Can we talk? I'm busy. I'm really sorry about the fight. And for breaking up with you. Nothing happened to me, okay? No one broke my heart. I just... I've seen so many people destroyed by love that I just... I built up walls and I made up rules. Did you hear me? I hear you, but... How do I really know you're ready to break those walls down?
