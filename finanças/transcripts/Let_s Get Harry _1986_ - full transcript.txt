What do you say, Leon? How do I look? Harry, you look like a man who wishes he was someplace else. Go tell your crew to act like they work for a living. Harry Burck? - How you doing, Mr. Ambassador? - I'm Reville Douglas. I saw the whole plant from the air. You guys have done one hell of a job. Well, thanks, but it's been a real team effort. This Colombian crew has been great. So you agree that the climate for American business investment is pretty good down here? Don't ask me. All I am is a glorified plumber. Boss back home says, "Harry, get on down there and put in some pipe". That's all I did. - So you're going home after tomorrow. - You bet. The people have been great. The experience has been great. The girls are great. I even avoided most of the Illinois winter, but... But you never really appreciate America, until you've spent six months someplace else. You got it. So, uh, what's the procedure tomorrow? All right, you and, uh, President Betancur are going to turn this valve here. It's gonna release some water from the, uh, aqueduct. Come on down here through the manifold, on down the hill through the turbine and lights go on all over Colombia and I'm out of here. Hey! What the hell's happening? Okay, let's go! Let's go, you guys! Give us a break. It's December. So? Bob, you promised you weren't going do this today, man. Hey, that's before I knew how beautiful it was gonna be. It's not beautiful, it's freezing. Put the top up. Please! You just get out of high school or something, Pachowski? Let me out. Put the top up or let me out. You're a mad man. A couple of babies. You were right, Bob. It is a beautiful day. Pachowski, I don't know how they even gave you a driver's license. They didn't. I bet you Harry'll be glad to get home, huh? Yeah, I mean, come on, six months in Colombia? I'd say that's a long enough vacation. Vacation? Spence, he was working. Working? On his tan. Hey, Bob, did you get enough beer? You think I should get another one? - Put that in the front. Put that in the front! - Move! Move! - Move! Move! - In the front! Where's that plant Harry was working on? Bogota. - All right. - Looks great. - Looks great. - Whoa, let's party. - Hey, let's break that keg. - Yeah. Bob. Hey, Dad. Hey, it's every man for himself. What's the matter? Harry's been kidnapped. What? Kidnapped? Why would anybody want to kidnap Harry, for Christ's sake? They were after the Ambassador. The opening in the new plant. Harry tried to stop them. - Who? - They don't know. Terrorists, maybe. Who told you this? Aw, some guy from Washington called. I'm sorry, fellows, but I'm afraid I don't have much to add. Ambassador Douglas was touring the plant before it officially opened. The kidnappers attack. Uh, Harry fought back, uh... Apparently armed with a wrench. Yeah, uh, yeah, Mr. Reilly. You know, we... We got all that from TV. I mean, we just flew six hundred miles. We just want to know what you're doing about it. I'm afraid there isn't much we can do. I mean, come on, Reagan just sent Marines right into Grenada. F-one Eleven's flew right into Libya. I mean, he's got to tell these Mexicans, "You let Harry go or you're dust!" In the first place, they're Colombians, not Mexicans. And in the second place, this situation is - totally different from the one... - Excuse me, Mr. Reilly, this is not some "situation". This is my brother. Do you understand? Okay. All right. I'm gonna tell you some things, but if you go public with this information, in any way, I'll deny it. We don't know much about the kidnappers except that their leader is a man called Carlos Ochobar. Who wants some of his friends, naturally he calls them political prisoners, let out of jail. If the prisoners are not released in 10 days then the hostages will be shot. So let them go. - It's not up to me. - Who's it up to? The policy of this administration is not to negotiate with terrorists under any circumstances. - So you send... - And you can forget about sending in the Marines or the Air Force. These guys aren't part of a hostile government. And... And they don't have, uh, bases that we can hit. They're a roving bunch of murderers with 2,50,000 square miles of trackless jungle to hide in. So that's it? You're not gonna do anything, right? I'm sorry, guys. That's the way it is. - Mr. Reilly... - Let's go, come on. Come on. I don't understand. You mean to tell me you went all the way to Washington and didn't even see the man? We saw his aide. He wouldn't see us. Well, that's just great, Corey. It wouldn't have made any difference, Dad. It's their policy. Aw, what's the use? - If Harry'd gone down there... - Don't start about Harry, Dad. Well, Harry would've gotten some answers. He's not here! Harry's not here, Dad! Well, maybe, Harry would have... The reason I went down there was Harry. But you want to know something? Harry couldn't have done nothing. Not even Harry can move the government when it don't want to be moved. So I don't want to hear about what Harry would've done, Dad, 'cause he's not here! I'm sorry, Corey. I know you did the best you could. Bears - fourteen. Vikings - seven. And we'll be back after this word from our local sponsor. Hi, Smiling Jack Abernathy here. You know, you can look on the north side of town. You can look on the south side of town. You can look on the east side of town. You can look on the west side of town. You can look all over town. But when you're ready to buy, you'll end up here. Tell them why, honey. Smiling' Jack says make your own deal. Yeah! You pick out the color, the make, the model, four-door Sedan or convertible. Tell me what you can afford and you'll make your own deal. Then you'll be smiling, too. First and ten for the twenty. Galt is wide to the right. Patton's in motion. McMann is back to throw. He's got Galt up the field. Oh, come on, come on, oh! He dropped the ball. That's the first time they've been able to stop Galt all afternoon. Oh, that's funny, Spence. Half... Half a yard, that's gonna cost me. Nice. What's with you, guys? You're supposed to be Harry's best friends. Hey, we are. What are we supposed to do? You're supposed to just sit here and watch a football game? Hey, Corey, you know, uh, none of us like it, but I mean, if Uncle Sam can't do nothing. Harry goes up against machine guns with a goddamn pipe wrench. You guys aren't even gonna try. Hey, why don't you guys just drop it, okay? Let it go. Hey, Spence, you drop it. You let it go. I'm going down there. To do what? I don't know, Kurt. Find my brother and bring him home. Well, I'll give you Superman's phone number. You can take him with you. Corey? Kurt? Hey, let me talk to him. Let me talk to him. Hey, Corey. Come on, man, take it easy. - Where the hell you going? - To get my brother. You don't even know where he's being held. - I'll find him. - Hey, just hold on a second. You're just not running off anywhere, okay? I love Harry, too. I mean, I... I got a family here. I got a wife. I got two kids. I got a house to think about. You wouldn't have this house, Kurt, if Harry hadn't co-signed the loan for you. Pachowski, you got laid off in Chicago. Who gave you a job, no questions asked? I mean, if it was me, if it was any of us, Harry'd be on the first goddamn plane to come and get us. He's right. Let's, uh, let's go do it. - Are you for real? - There's no way. No. Well, I'm tired of getting pissed on, Spence. - How about you? - You want to go down there and get him? Spence, what are we gonna do, leave him there? Yeah. - It's not that easy. - All right, come on, let's do it. Come on. It's fucking nuts. Let's get Harry. Listen to this crap. "Mercenary for hire." "Gung ho?" I don't believe it. "Soldier of Fortune." You guys have cracked. Look, if we're gonna do this right we need a pro. It's that simple, okay? Uh, Spence, you run the interviews. Me? Come on, why me? 'Cause you're shop steward and you think you're Mr. Fucking Wizard, that's why. Well, you've got a point there, Bob. - All right, let's go. - Here goes nothing. - Hi, my name's... - No names! Okay, well what would you like us to call you? You can call me Rambo. In addition to the Balisong, I also carry a Nighthawk and a Fairbairn-Sykes throwing knife. For my malaria. You fought in Vietnam, Chile, Angola, Falklands, Lebanon. And you helped plan the raid on Entebbe, right? That's right, mate. Kill them all, and let God sort them out. That's me motto. We'll be in touch. We got a nut case, a possible drug addict, a couple of drunks and the rest... Are you satisfied? I don't care. I'm still going. Well, without me. You're a pussy, Kurt! Bob, real bright. Way to go. Come on, you guys, this is a load of crap. I mean, Kurt was right. I mean, what are we? We're a bunch of plumbers. You know, we're gonna go down to some foreign country and play soldier? Aw, gee. I mean, let's get serious. I mean, this is not gonna work. Not with that attitude, it isn't. How'd you get in? Well, for a situation like this I use the door. What code name do you use? Norm. Norm? Well, I'm not too fond of it myself but we don't pick our parents, do we? Norman Shrike. Don't worry about it. My Spanish will be fine down there, okay? Now as I understand it, this house belongs to Harry Burck, Sr.? That's right. A guy by the name of Harry Burck, Jr. from Aurora, Illinois, is being held by Carlos Ochobar. Some other guys from Aurora are looking for a professional soldier. - I love this guy. - Excuse me. Now let's get down to the mission. Now I have a picture here of Carlos Ochobar. Look at it and remember that face. Now the press has been calling him the mystery man. What he is, in fact, is a scumbag drug dealer who's pissed off because his government's extraditing his dealers to stand trial in the U.S. And Ochobar wants to trade our Ambassador for his dealers. What about my brother, Harry? Harry doesn't mean shit to them. They'll kill him just to show they mean business. - How'd you find all this out? - Who cares how, Spence? What counts is this guy knows. I mean, well, how do we know, you know, you can handle yourself? Okay. A medal of honor. Far out. Can't shake that cold, eh, Spence? - Dut! - How you doing, Jack? I'm doing good. How you doing? Sneaking by. - J.D., rocks, twice. - You got it. Better not be watered down, neither. - Is that good for you? - Mmm-hmm. Hey, fellows! Let me buy you a drink. Thanks, Mr. Abernathy. - Call me Jack. - All right. Let's have a round of Chippewa Pride - for my friends here. - Sure thing, Jack. Hey, Corey. I want you to know I'm sorry about what happened. I mean, I never heard a bad word about Harry. You know, this whole town feels the same way. I mean, it's a goddamn shame. I can't understand what's happened to this country. You know, in the old days, they wouldn't put up with this nonsense. They'd send in the Marines and I mean right now! I just can't understand it. It just makes me sick. I guess all we can do is pray, huh? Hey, Dut, whatever these guys want, put it on my tab. - Yes, sir, Jack. - Okay? - Whoa! Are you ready? - Uh-huh. Okay. Corey, if there's anything I can do for you, call me up. - Okay, Jack. - Okay. - See ya, fellows. - Ooh. - Give my best to your dad. - All right. - Isn't it about time he got a new truck? - Yeah, I guess. Well, send him in. Make his own deal. I'll mention it to him. - Okay. - See ya, Dut. - Bye-bye. Keep it hot. This really blows my mind. I mean, are you guys really serious? What is it with you, Spence? You think if you keep asking that question you're gonna get the answer you want to hear? If you don't want to go, don't go! Bullshit! You're going! Hey, lighten up. All right? All I'm saying is this. I think if we're gonna go down there, we should all go together. So, you in or out? I'll go, if Kurt goes. Come on, Kurt. All right. Oh, great. I mean, so he convinces her. Well, what are we gonna do about money? Rob a bank? What's the problem now? - Money. - So, we'll rob a bank. That's great! That's great! You fellows are what this country used to be all about. Don't take crap from nobody. I tell ya, I was robbed once. Then I started carrying this little baby here. Smith & Wesson. I'd like to see somebody try it now. Boom! You know what I mean? Anyway, my politics are no secret. What can I do for you? Well, uh, we figured for a job like this, uh, we're gonna need some help, right? So, uh, we hired a pro. You know, a... A mercenary. Good move, good move! Is he any good? Yeah, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor. Right, but these guys don't come cheap, you know, and, uh, we're a bunch of working stiffs. What, you a little shy on cash? Right! Right. So we figured that, uh... So maybe I could help you out with a little loanie? - Yeah. - How much? We don't need it all up front. Okay, we can pay him half now. - Well, how much? - We got six thousand bucks. - How much? - Forty thousand. Whoa! Forty thousand? - Forty grand. That's serious money. - I know. Look, Mr. Abernathy, we wouldn't come to you if there was any other way. Corey, don't get me wrong. I want to help, but 40k. Another hand job. Excuse me, son. Hey, Jack. Yeah? Did you nail all these suckers yourself? Oh! Every one. - Really? - Damn knee kept me out of Vietnam. That pissed me off. Yeah, I've been on safaris. Africa, Alaska, South America. Did you see that white rhino? I nailed him to Botswana, dead-on heart shot with a .458 Winchester. And if I'd have missed, I wouldn't be here talking to y'all. Whew! God, you know, it must cost a fortune to stuff and mount these things. You wouldn't believe it. It's $1500 a head. That's nothing compared to this full-bodied gazelle. Exactly how much do all your hunting trips cost? Shit. Very good. Very good. I ought to have you selling cars for me. Like that white rhino, I think I just been nailed. But I want to get one thing straight. If I pay for a hunting trip, I go on it. Corey? Where you going? I told ya, Dad. We're going fishing. Well, don't fall in. Probably be unemployed when we get back. What makes you think we're gonna make it back? Oh, that's funny, Bob. Whoa! - Hey, Jack, give me some stuff. - How much? Why don't you fellows let me handle the money? We've already been over that. Jack handles the money. Here ya go. Found another one. There's not much more. Big Mickey, how you doing? A-ha! Stormin' Norman! Right on time. Good job. Thanks a lot, fellows. You know, I think we should have at least gotten passports. Where we're going, we won't need them. Okay, how'd you get this gig? You still waving that big dick medal around? Did you tell them exactly how you got it? I want to know how I can find Alphonso? Alphonso? I wonder what they're talking about. Huh? Come on, amigo. Hell, he's out of business. Living high somewhere. In the hills outside of Bogota. Don't have no exact address. Gee, look at all that blow! Wait a minute, fellows. I think we should just take a minute here and talk. Talk about what? About that stuff. It's not exactly legal, you know. What's the problem? That. I didn't see anything. Neither did you. - Yeah, I did. - Hey. You want to abort the mission, you do it now. Because once we're on that plane, fellows, we're in for the duration. Okay? Yes, sir. My troops. I knew if I accepted this post, there'd be risks. That comes with the territory these days. But I never dreamed I'd end up being bait for some drug lord trying to get his dealers out of jail. I've never been bait for anybody in my life. Come on, let's get out of here! Come on, run! I hope you enjoyed your morning exercise. I have made contact with your government, Mr. Ambassador. They have one week to release my friends who are now in jail in the U.S.A. It'll never happen. Well, if my friends are not released, you and the Ambassador will die. And that is only the beginning. There are many Americans in Colombia. I can take my pick. You should've nailed him, Bob. Iguanas are good eating. I've had them on a stick. Get out of here. Here he comes. - They want $3,000 for the Renault. - All right. Three thousand dollars? I ought to open my own dealership down here, Norman. I ain't giving $3,000 for that piece of shit. That's a rip-off. Then you make the deal, Smiling Jack. Jack, give him the money. - That's a lot of money. - Jack, give him the money. Three thousand dollars. - Expensive. - I don't give a shit. Take it up with him. Here, $3,000, one Renault. Norm, army patrol comin'! - Huh? - Fuck! Move out, on the double, on the double! Let's go! - Come on! Keep it cool! - What do you mean, an army patrol? Put the stuff in the trunk. Come on. - Adios, amigo! - Big guys in the back. Let's go! On the double! Let's go! Here I got it! Give me that. Put it in there! Christ! - Watch your heads! - All right, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Get in, get in! Take it easy! This thing had better start! Take it easy! Get in! Come on. Don't flood it, Shrike! Come on! Oh, come on! Please start, please start. Come on, please! All right, let's go! Fast! Come on, Shrike. Pull out. Move! Whoa, yeah! Fellas. Ahh! Whoo! Open my bag. There's a black bag inside with guns in it. Throw it out the window. - Guns? What do you mean, guns? - If you don't want to get shot, throw 'em out. Get 'em out! - Go on, do it! - Get 'em out! Shit! Fuck! What should we do? Shut up! Just give me $100. Just give me some. A hundred dollars! Get your hands up. What in the hell have we gotten ourselves into? All right, all right! Sorry! Shit! Please, please! Whew! Mmm-hmm. Maybe it's better if we... If we settle matters right here. Smuggler pig! The man's an artist. Get out of my district. You don't know how painful and expensive that can be. - Gracias. - Whew! The Indians say that if you spit after a close call, you'll be protected in the future. I think we spit too late. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh! Whoa! Oh, please, God. Jesus Christ. Please, God. What now? We walk. Guess the Hilton was all booked up, eh, Norm? How come Shrike got the single? Probably needs it to count my money. Know what I mean? What did I tell you? Don't ever open the door 'til you know who's on the other side. Right. Let me have $3,000. What's it for? It's better if you don't know. Well, you better know. We got exactly six days. - Six's plenty of time. - Okay. No, wait. Let's just hold on a second here, okay? I want to know something about the guns we ditched. You didn't say anything about guns. You said he was gonna take all the risks. We'll let the government do the actual rescue. That's what I intend to do, but I've been sniffin' around outside. There's a state of siege on in this country, so it doesn't hurt to be prepared, does it? Which reminds me, let's have it. - I just gave you three grand. - No, no, no, no, no, no. This. This. Yes. - Oh, shit! - Oh, man. Now, do you know what would have happened if the military police had found this on you back there? What would have happened? They would have blown our heads off! Now listen to me, fellas. This isn't a game. Now, even if you do exactly as I say, some of us might not make it back alive. Now, I'm gonna go out when it gets dark. I'll be gone for two hours. I want everybody to stay here. That means everybody. God damn it, Norman. - I don't think we should be followin' so close. - I don't want to lose him. We're not gonna lose him. I wanna know what he's up to. - We lost him. Shit! - You can say that again. Buenos noches, amigos. Let's go. Excuse me, slime. All right! All right! It's time to pay your entry tax. Hey, get out! I told you guys to stay put. I'm not your babysitter. Go back to the hotel, all right? You must understand... Cocaine is my daughter's education. It keeps my mother well cared for in her old age. It takes care of my wife's family. Is it bad what I do? No. You're a regular Mother Teresa. Can I interest you in some dinner? I understand. People who are not used to the jungle tend to lose their appetites up here. This... It is truly a different way of life. I'm sure you would like to go home. Home to your family... Your friends. What do you want from us? I want you to help me save your life. Your Embassy doesn't seem to be interested in talking to me, so... I'd like you to talk to them. I could talk all night. I don't think it'll make a difference. They don't deal with people like you. It's easy for you to be a wise guy. You don't know what it's like to go hungry. I know you're a fucking low life. You deal in misery. Take it easy, my friend. Isn't he a beauty? Yes, I like to think that these are the finest fighters in the whole country. I'm sure they are. You seem surprised that I would turn out to be a sporting man. Not really. It's a sport that suits you, Alphonso. Well, if there is an insult there, I'll try not to find it. So, you go after Ochobar. Certainly a worthy challenge. But I don't understand. What, uh, exactly is it you want from me? Well, I need to know where he's hiding the hostages... One. Ah. And two, I need firepower. Well... Among the many things, I'm sure you learned from Mickey. He must have told you I'm out of the business. Listen, I got no time to fool around. - Are you gonna help me or what? - Amigo... You know I want to help, huh? Please, tell me. What kind of weapons? Well, it's got to be something simple for my team because they aren't exactly pros. Bueno. Mini-Uzis? Bueno. And for you... I'll bring something special. How much is this gonna cost me? At my stage in life, money isn't everything. - Pay me what you can. - Okay. I'm gonna give you $3,000. More than generous. All right, meet me tonight at the... Al gimnasio... La Via de la Paz, 10:00. Meanwhile, I'll check with some sources and we're gonna find the rock this snake is hiding under. You all stick together, all right? Stay close. What is this? These are goddamn antiques! Well... This... This is a terrible mess, isn't it? You know, frankly... I'm surprised. You know, you look like a professional to me. Why? Why in God's name did the... Did you ever put your trust in a man like... Like Alphonso? Ah! $3,000! This is what he pays for loyalty. One must pay him a great deal more to secure his, eh? I didn't count on inflation. Inflation. Well, to business. Americans, eh? In this country, illegally. And illegally buying guns. Why? Hmm? To encourage revolution, perhaps? I don't think so. I think you came down here to rescue your Ambassador. Now... What I, uh, want you to tell me is... Who is behind your little operation? No one. You want me to believe that, uh, you and those five amateurs are going to tiptoe into, uh, Carlos Ochobar's headquarters and, uh, free the hostages by yourselves, hmm? Why not? Somebody better do it. There is no official record of your presence in this country, Mr. Shrike. In these dangerous times, terrible things can happen! Now I must know who is behind you! No one. Who is behind you, Mr. Shrike? Tell me! Who is behind you? Who? Speak up! No more jokes! Fuck you, chinga tu madre. Bitch! Get the pretty one. You know, you are lucky. You're American. I like Americans. America is such a beautiful place. With so many wonderful things for a boy like you, eh? But you will never live to see any of them, unless you cooperate. What do you want? What do I... What do I want? I want you to talk to me. I simply must know who's behind you. Nobody. I put this thing together myself. They're gonna take us out to some farm and shoot us. Shut up! I'm sorry. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Come on. Don't shoot! - Take it easy! - Put your hands up. Keep them up. - Fellas? I'm Walt Clayton from the Embassy. - Oh, thank God! Sorry about last night. I didn't get word on this thing until a couple hours ago. Anyway, we'll get your paperwork squared away. You men are on your way home. We're goin' home? All right! - Beautiful! - I wanna say something to you, though. What you did was not only illegal but it was damn dangerous. Well, it had to be done. Well, my friend, you came about this close to a firing squad. Whose bright idea was this, anyway? Mine. I'm Harry's brother. Well, you're lucky he still has one. That's great, but, uh, we came here to get Harry. When's he comin' home? He and the Ambassador should be released very soon. How 'bout that? Negotiations have been gone on between the U.S. Government and these kidnappers, - since day one. - All right! An agreement's imminent. Anyway, you have about 10 minutes before your plane leaves so, if you guys want to wash up there's a john over there. We've brought your stuff from the hotel. We took care of your bills. - Feel free. - Thank you, Mr. Clayton. Mr. Clayton, I'm Jack Abernathy. Abernathy Chevrolet. Thank you very much, sir. All right! Free and clear! Somebody get me a... Oh, yeah! All right! Harry's coming home! These negotiations. If it was Henry Kissinger or a plane-load of hostages, that's one thing. But what we have here, as I see it is a no-name Ambassador and a plumber. Have a nice trip. Jesus Jose! I tell you, being guests of the government doesn't come cheap! This place is definitely off my vacation list. What was that all about? We talked a little bit about Harry. And? It was bullshit, wasn't it? They're not doing a goddamn thing! That's right. They want us out of the way, fellas. Wait! There was a negotiation. There was an agreement. There's no negotiation. There's no agreement. This guy, Clayton, was just doing a tap dance! God damn it! This is just a short hop to a neutral field. I'm gonna go along with you guys to make sure you don't have any problems with customs or anything. All right, well, don't everybody thank me at once. Great. Okay! Okay! Okay, let's go, let's go! Come on! Let's go! Let's go, come on! Spence, Jack, come on. - Let's go! Corey's next! Let's go! - Come on! Jump! Corey! Come on! - Kurt! - No! Corey! Come! No! Come on! Get out of here! Don't worry about him! Kurt, are you with us? - Kurt! - No! Jump! Shrike! - You're a chicken shit! - Fuck you, man! I'm no chicken! - Come on! - No! I'm goin' home! Come on! Let's go! Don't slow down! We're almost across now. Don't slow down! Fuckin' Kurt, man! I can't believe it. Don't be so tough on him. Every man has got a different breaking point. What's your problem, man? You think you've cornered the market on balls 'cause you won the Medal of Honor or something? Let me tell you something, ace. I got the medal, I certainly did. But I'll never forget the three faces that paid for it. Our patrol got ambushed in Laos. Relief choppers were called in and as we pulled out I saw three of my guys running out of the tree line. I'd given the signal to pull out too soon. I mean, we could have gone back but we didn't. It was dangerous but I could have gone back. I didn't. It was shock on their faces. I mean, If I live to be a 100, I'll never forget the look on their faces as we pulled away. They got further and further away from us. I pulled out too soon, you see. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you never know what you're gonna do until the time comes or you never know what you're gonna do until you do it. What's that supposed to mean? That means things have changed. That means the only way your brother's coming home is if we go and get him ourselves. So... So, we've been running away until now. Anybody can do that. What I want to know is how many of you guys are actually ready to kill to get Harry out? We'll do what we have to do. Thank you. Bad information. See, that's another reason why I'm getting out of this business. I heard you were on an airplane. I got off. Well, yeah. I heard about your problems and believe me, I... That dwarf... That dwarf has already been punished. Now if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to go into your office and talk for a few minutes, if it's all right with you. Of course. We have much to talk about. Yes, we do. You can bet your ass we do! Not bad. A little heavy. But it'll do. When was the last time you supplied Ochobar? Two years ago. - You deal with him directly? - No! No, no, no, no. - Through a contact in his organization. - Okay. Call your contact and make a deal for tomorrow. What should I say? You're so goddamn smart, you figure it out. Okay. Where the hell is he? What's he... Spence, you... - Where'd you get that? - What are you doing? I brought it with me. Hey, don't worry. It's cool. That's the reason why Harry got grabbed - in the first place. - Exactly. Hey, listen. I don't have a problem with it, okay? - Maybe you got a problem with it. - Give me that shit! - Hey, it keeps me alert, all right? - Hey, hey! Shut up! - Give me. - Hey! - How'd it go? - I'll give you the payoff. He's still supplying Ochobar with his firepower. He's set up a meeting between us and his cowboy contact. How do we know that it's not another trap? Something in his attitude convinced me. You were right, plumber. Your government doesn't seem interested in negotiating with me. In fact, with just a few days left, someone is trying to rescue you. It is your brother. But I have a little surprise waiting for him. I need to convince your government that I am serious. Besides, you've been a most troublesome guest. - Haven't you? - But there's still three days left! I've changed my mind. Okay, fellas, the game is over. Now listen to me and listen good. Your eye goes wherever the muzzle of the weapon goes. Keep your finger out of the trigger well unless you're ready to fire. All right? Bullets do not go where you wish, they go where they're aimed. Goddamn, a woman! I hear something, man. - What'd she say? - That she's not with Ochobar anymore. Oh, fabulous. Your friend, Alphonso, fucked us again! She's full of shit! She's one of them! Take cover! - Abernathy! 12 o'clock, high! On go! - Gotcha! Go! Cover me, guys! Cover me! - Whoo! - We did it! We got 'em! We got 'em. We did it. We kicked their ass. We did. Jesus Christ. Goddamn. God damn it, it's my fault. Hey! That's the police captain. Let's get the hell out of here. And what about her? She set us up! She comes with us. I don't care, man! Let's get the hell out of here. Okay, little lady, you may be foolin' these kids with that cold-blooded act of yours, but you're not foolin' me. I don't know whether you understand or habla English but I have a question you're gonna answer. And if I have to push, I will! Okay. Whoa-ho! What do we got here? A little frogsticker? Huh? A little frogsticker? You ain't gonna be stickin' nothin'! You don't mind if I smoke, do you? Now, one more time. Where the fuck are the Americans? Where are they? No? Jack! What the hell are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? You wanna find Harry? Harry? You don't even know Harry! Don't you come at me, you little punk! I'll break your neck! You ain't gonna do shit, old man! You hear me? Whoa! Okay. Look, I don't know if you understand me but I'm sorry. I just want to apologize, that's all I'm trying to say to you. You're free now. You can go. What's goin' on down here? We're in the middle of nowhere, my brother's got two days to live and we don't even know where he is. I told you this thing was never gonna work, man. That's right! You told me, God damn it! I just need some help. I will help. How far is it to Ochobar's compound? In this boat, two days. That doesn't give us much time. You must know, it's a heavily guarded compound. We may not find your brother. I'll have to worry about that when we get there. You boys planning a little boat trip, huh? This must be your guide. What can we do for you? Nothing. The name's Al King. I just don't get a chance to talk to too many fellow Americans down here, that's all. We're from Canada. Well... You be careful. This river can be full of surprises. More surprises. That's just what we need. What about Jack? We gonna leave him? Corey, take me along. You know, I always finish what I start. Now, what I did back at the house, I was just tryin' to get more information. I'm sorry. Okay, Jack. Thanks, Corey. Okay. Let's go. Okay. We have to stop here for the night and go by foot in the morning. All right. Keep your eyes open, guys. Get the weapons, Spence. Now keep your eyes open and stick together. What the hell was that? It's just a monkey. He probably thinks we're fucking up the neighborhood. I've had 'em on a stick. Okay, Ochobar's quarters are here. The lab and the barracks are here. You think Harry's somewhere in here? Yes. - I want you to go. - No, I said I will help. You have helped more than enough. But this is our fight. But how will you get back? We have other plans. Don't worry. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. Americans always think everything will be okay. Good luck, Corey. Whoa. All right. Ochobar's compound is over this next ridge. All right, look. Here's the compound. Guard tower's here. Veronica said Harry and the Ambassador should be here in the barracks. Okay. How many men does Ochobar have? - About 50. - Fifteen? Not bad. - She said 50. - Fifty? - Shut up. - Whoa. - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. If we do this right, we'll be in and out before they know what hit 'em. All right. We'll split up into two groups. Jack, you and I'll take the guard tower, go for Harry. Right. - How you gonna do that? - With these. Spence, Pachowski, go for the lab, which is here. So you get it, take it, set it, and rig it to blow. One of you take the chemical storage room, which is here. Set that to blow. All right? And set up some kind of diversion so we can get to the dock. All right, I'll get the lab. Spence, you get the storeroom. I'm still on this part about the 50 guards. Hey, look. You gotta give us 10 minutes from the time we separate before things start to blow, all right? Ten minutes, you got it. Okay, we'll meet at the docks. Take one of the boats and make sure they don't follow us. Okay, who's gonna stay back and cover the rear? Somebody's got to do it. I'll do it. Okay. All right, come on. Come on. Jack. - Okay, let's do it. - Let's do it. Nada? Nada. Okay, go now. Good luck. - Jack. - Okay. Okay. Oh! Now, I'll show you how this son of a bitch works. This is one of the most complicated weapons ever devised. You take a dart, dip it in poison. And then you just pucker-up and blow. One drawback, don't inhale. Don't miss. Let's go. Antonio! Shit. I don't fucking believe it. It's his jacket. It's Harry's jacket. So much for plan A. - Spence, they moved Harry. Keep 'em busy. - You got it! Hey! Harry! Go! No closer or this man dies. You little creep! I'll have you on a stick! Jack! No closer! Corey! Harry! Harry! Come on! Corey! Harry! How the hell are you? Much better now. Thanks, Corey. Whoo! Spence, where's Pachowski? I don't know. He should be right behind me. Pachowski! Pachowski! Pachowski! - Hey! Harry! - Come on! Come on! - Come on! They're right behind you! - Let's go! Watch my leg! Watch my leg! Come on, let's go! Let's get outta here! - Come on! - Here they come! Well, come on, you guys, let's go! Now, Spence! Attention, please. Attention, please! I have very good news. Harry Burck has just been rescued! Welcome, Harry.
