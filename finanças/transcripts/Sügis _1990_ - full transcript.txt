AUTUMN Script by Mats Traat Based on stories of Oskar Luts Directed by Arvo Kruusement Cinematography by Valeri Blinov Art design by Toomas Hõrak Costume designer Mare Raidma Original music by Veljo Tormis Sound by Mati Schönberg Misses, here we are. Thank you. - You're welcome. Lible, take it to the other side of the house. - All right. Lible, who are those city slickers you brought here? Lible, who are those city slickers you brought here? I just took the first load of brides to Paunvere. Many a bachelor around here should get his hands on a young miss. Stop it with your jokes, Lible. Hello. - Hello there. What's that I see? A Singer sewing machine. Damn it, what's that supposed to mean? - Competition must be. You won't get done anything without competition anymore. We're no longer living in a cold and dark empire. It's the republic now and there's fighting everywhere. You and your load of junk will be gone like the lightning! Excuse me, gentlemen, but where's the fire? Nowhere. - Just shut your window now. This music here bids welcome to the horse of Ülesoo's master. So it was Ülesoo Toots who cooked up this mess for me? All right, Mister Kiir. Take it from this side. Never! You just bugger off with your competitors. What's that I hear now? Your late father competed all of the other tailors to death around here. But you just let your competitors settle in right by your side. Maybe they'll just do handicraft. - You wish! The Singer machine bites through everything. Jorh, you shouldn't worry, you're a trained farmer, aren't you? You shut up! - Stop your bickering. Let's think up a plan. I'll never buy another cracknel from the baker again. He took them in to bother us. - The baker won't care about that. What do they look like? - One of them is tall. A black coat and a red hat, looks like an assistant stationmaster. And the other one is short, low to the ground. They must be competed to death! - It won't help. Let's get the tongues waggling! Then they'll be gone soon like a load of shit. "We do sewing and some needlework". Damn it all, needlework as well! Here you are, misses. - Thank you. Good-bye. - Good-bye. Hello. At your service, Mister Kiir. We'd like to buy fabric for one suit. That's good fabric indeed. We'll take it. I'll get a dapper confirmation suit. Good fabric indeed. Misses Vispel also bought it for a suit's worth. They bought men's fabric? To do men's suits and force us out of business. And you have dealings with them. In that case I won't buy as much as a button from this store anymore. We'll be buying our fabric in town from now on. What have you done? That's the latest Paris fashion. We don't sew up bags, we're tailor artists. I'm a flax salesman. I don't need this Paris fashion. Cuffs will be here. Cuffs? What are those? - A watch in the pocket, so that the chain shows. Keep the flaps open. Like so! You've completely wasted my expensive fabric. What are you doing? You're worse than moths. Moths make just a little hole. You've cut it up completely and somehow tacked it back again. And now you think it's all good! This suit! Not fit for a pig! Oh my God! Damn it! Are you dead? Give me a hand, will you? One moment. What an accident! Were you hurt bad? It doesn't matter. Mister Kiir has helped me home. Would you be so kind as to step inside for a moment? - Oh no. I won't. Hand me my cane. No, master Kiir, step inside, let's talk sensibly and have a cup of tea. We can talk here. This accident was no fault of mine. You're so stubborn. Come inside. Maali, just push him. I don't want to come like this. Come closer to the table, master Kiir. Let's drink some tea. With bramble jam! - I don't drink tea. Master Kiir, we've been thinking about you a lot recently. Is that so? - Yes! I just can't understand why everyone hostile against us. - How so? Let's talk openly. It was quite clear one week after we came to Paunvere that your family doesn't like us. - What? I haven't wronged you in any way. There are all sorts of groundless stories about us. And we know for sure that your family has started them. That's a lie! Yes. Our family has never spread unfounded rumours. Master Kiir, listen to me! All of us want to make a living. Isn't it so? And the only way of doing that is work. Absolutely! No doubt about it! Don't mind old wives' tales. As if they didn't slander me! Oh yes. But one thing's for sure. Keep away from Ülesoo Toots and his wife. Are they really so horrible people? - Yes, they are, unfortunately. Paunvere is a wretched place anyhow. No-no... No sensible people at all, to say nothing about friends. You live here like a bum. You better not say a word. Or else it's turned upside down and then one fine day you get served things you've never even dreamed of! What do I care about tales? Let them speak! I know very well that they call me Klodvig. And I'm the Assistant Stationmaster. How horrible! Nobody must see me here. Godspeed to everyone here. - What would you like? Did you come about some business? Business? How about... sewing a suit for me. No, we don't sew for grown-ups. Why d'ya think I'm all growed up? 'Morrow I'll bring cloth. Then you take the measures. Don't bring us anything, we don't know how to sew for you. You see, misses... I'm a flax salesman. They say it's a very profitable business. But it's hard to take care of business all by my lonesome. An other half would be fine. There's no shortage of "other halves" in the world. You can't take two, can you? - You'll just have to pick one. I did already. But how do I know if she wants me? - Ask her. I wanted to ask: "Won't you come to be my other half?" Two nice young maidens here... You don't want both of them, do you? You have to know which one you like. I don't care. Aaberkukk, just go home and stop bothering us here. You can't be taking both of them! I just want one. The taller one would do fine. Get lost! Scram! Absolutely. Five cracknels. - I'll give you ten. - Well... all right. Hello. - Hi there. Some of those bagels as well! Three, if at all. - I'll give you fine. - That's too much... Some cake? - I don't know... All right, just one. - Two? - One is enough. Here you are. Something for the lady? - I'll take candy. And some cardamom. - I'll give you two... You're always so punctual that one could set the clock by you. - Absolutely. Is it true what Benno just told me? Answer me in the name of truth and justice or be punished by God. Yes, that's right. I've gone there before, I went there today and will go in the future. I told you so! You know... I've learned to know Miss Juuli... and Miss Maali. And I've found them to be proper girls with honest ways. And I... love them. And I've decided to ask for their hand in marriage... - Both of them? - Yes... And I've told you that in the name of truth and justice. You're mad! You've gone completely batty! They have fed you henbane. They've cast their evil eye on you! - Stop this slander, you don't know them. They may be our competitors but that gives you no right to slander them. You won't bring a woman under my roof. Never-ever will I let you marry this pint-sized tubby. Or this beanstalk, this skyscraper, this... I'll listen to my heart even without your consent. Oh my God! And that's the way my flesh and blood speaks to me! Mommy! But we can eliminate our competitors this way. And the Lord says: "It's not good that the man should be alone. I will make him an help meet for him. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife. And they shall be one flesh." Thus I ask you: Do you want to take this bride for your wedded wife? To love and honour her with unchanging loyalty and respect her? If that is your firm will, then confirm this by clearly stating: "Yes". Yes. Absolutely. Thusly I ask of you: Do you want to take this groom for your lawful and wedded husband? To love and honour him with unchanging loyalty and obey him? If that is your firm will, then confirm this by stating: "Yes". - Yes. What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. May God grant you his blessings and his joy. Amen. What might have happened to you if it weren't for me! They called on us to liberate our land and all of us did go! And how we spilled our blood, reckless with our lives. Many schoolmates like Kipper, Peterson, Tiuks never came back. Your own brother fell at Narva. Our brother Viktor fell at Narva. Jorh, when two out of three brothers have been to war and one of them dies, the survivors must get something in return. Jorh? They must give you a farm. You could really apply for a farmstead in Viktor's name. I should have got a knight's estate a long time ago. Why don't you take it then? You may become Baron von Jorh Aadniel Kiir. I'm not the type to meddle in everything. - You could be. You know all about farming. Save your mouth for eating! - Let's go and drink some coffee. Juuli, let's go. Maali, why don't you come, as well? How many wives did Jorh take for himself? Maali. Stop it, Jorh. There's been enough kissing, patting and caressing, now I'm that way. Which way? - I'm expecting. For a longer time already. Come back! - What's it to me? - Oh? But what if I shout it all over Paunvere? Hush! Let's think about it. If things are like that, then it won't matter. Juuli doesn't have it, you do. So what? You're good, Jorh. - Naturally. Let the baby come if it wants. Jorh! We must have a serious talk. That's it! The last order. Soon we must tighten our belts. Damn it! That's it. Jorh, you've got a visitor. Hello there, dear schoolmate! - Joosep? Is that you? Hello! Hello there, Bruno Benno Bernhard! How times flies! When you were christened, me and Jorh drank a whole bottle of Lati Pac. Absolutely! Dear schoolmate, do come in. I congratulate you for tying the knot. Congratulations! The lady as well! Jorh gave his vows to Juuli. I'm sorry, miss! Absolutely my best wishes to Mrs Juuli for assuming the role of a hostess in this house where harmony, joy and labour should reign. We would labour but there will be no work soon. I've just come to offer you some. Parties and fairs are coming up. The ladies need new clothes. Ülesoo farm needs a good seamstress. Miss Maali can sew and does a lot of handicraft as well. Fine. - But my dear Joosep, come in and let's drink some coffee. Let's have a serious word. Juuli, see if there's some coffee. Maali, are the pies there? Absolutely! Thank you. Here you are. What's wrong? - Nothing. Dear schoolmate and comrade in arms, I want to become a farmer. Again? - Yes. I can get free land on the name of my brother Viktor. Have you applied to the council? You're a member of the council, it's enough if you support me. You did go to Russia once to study cattle breeding. And you furthered your studies at my place. We didn't spill our blood and fight for our land in vain. What would've happened to our people if the Russians had remained. I must get the land! Rest for a while. The skirts won't run away. Take some! - Thank you. You first! What's wrong with your foot? Sciatica. - What's that? It's a travelling disease. - Travelling? It starts from the leg, travels all around the body and finally hits the head! How awful! - Before the Great War when I had a estate in Russia, the owner Ivanov often had sciatica in his head. And if it hit his head, he took a thick club and the first person to cross his path took a thrashing! But it's the worst if sciatica goes to the heart. All hell will break loose. Making plans with Maali? The master was telling about a mad estate owner. Let's try the dress on. Dad, you cannot watch. You're getting a new dress and I cannot watch? - You can't. She is bashful. - You cannot! What a typical girl! Let's hurry up! They're singing already. We're always late. Mom had to pretty herself up. - Am I not allowed to do that? Ladies and gentlemen! Paunvere farmers! A lot of time has passed and we're again a free people on free land. Our sovereignty grants us the right and the opportunity to work on our homeland just as we ourselves see fit. The sovereignty follows a hard war where some of our best sons have fallen. And that's why we have to be industrious and tenacious. And remember what C.R. Jakobson said: "The Estonian people rise up and fall with the farmers." So we should work and promote farming, cattle-breeding, cooperation and culture. In short, we should all of us together and in brotherly love promote life in Estonia. Here they are. That's mine. - Not a bad specimen. - And strong enough. I should take my mare to meet your stallion. Be my guest. That's easy to do. My Hamlet has sirred calves in nearly all the farms. Dad! I'd like some ice-cream. - And mead. Later on. Let's have a look at the bulls. Why here? We can watch them at home all we like. Buy three buns, get one for free. Buy three ice-creams, get one for free. Thank you. - Here you are. For you, miss? Mom! I want some ice-cream, too! Go get some. Here you are. - Good boy. Can you still find time to play your zither sometimes? It was quite nice to dance to your tunes. Forward, men of Kentucky! Death to the redskins! This is my wife Mrs Juuli. Hello. - Hi. You took her secretly, never told your schoolmates. Still waters run deep. Next Wednesday the county council meets. We have one farmstead to give to a veteran of the Independence War. Stop now! Hi men! Come now, take your place under this roof. Why? - Tailor Jorh Aadniel Kiir has invited you to a party. A party? - That's right. I'm not telling you a lie. Take it, friends. Don't let it get cold. What are you waiting for, Jüri? Jaan, don't hesitate, all of you. Just gobble it all down. I didn't order this. Don't be stingy, Mr Kiir. - Economy is not stinginess. Mr Aaberkukk! I've had enough now. Wait! Stop! What do you want? - We're invited. - By whom? - Lible. Tailor Kiir has asked all of you to partake in a lunch. What do we got? - Something fattening and sweet and sour. That's the right door. - Lible? - What? What are you sending those strangers in for? Just county councillors. What now? Look at who's coming. Hi, schoolmate. Do come in. What's there? - You know... other farm owners are there... So what are you doing there? Bumpkin! So he's too good for the Paunvere guys? All righty, that's enough for today. Your attention please. A petition. Heinrich Georg Aadniel Kiir, residence: Paunvere, occupation: Tailor. Wants to get a farmstead for his brother Viktor, killed in he war. What do you say? This farmstead would suit anyone. The tailor ain't the poorest bloke. Many are poorer. They should be considered first. Those who lost their health in the war. Mr Aaberkukk! You drank like a fish on my expense! And now you speak against me. - Mr Kiir, I call you to order. Do I get this land or not? My brother... - Calm down. My brother Viktor... - You're not a farmer. You're a tailor. Please leave. And that's how it will be. I'll go to the capital now. Didn't you get anything at the county? I'll see if the truth and justice have really ended in this world. Documents, kind sir! You have to turn to your local authority to get a farmstead. I don't want this farm for my military expenses. I would give it to my mother for the son she lost in the war. Start at the local authority. Submit the necessary documents. The papers, the credentials, who wants, on whose name, why. Then we consider this and will approve it if everything is okay. The council already turned me down. Paunvere is a horrible place. Everybody cheats there. I'll tell you all about it and then you'll see that the sun will set before things get right in Paunvere. I'm sorry but your audience is over. Good day. - All right. In that case I'll tell you. Paunvere council cheats. There's this Tõnisson and this Toots and this Aaberkukk. They all... Let's clean the mouth. We'll sell this old house and move away from Paunvere. And what will we be doing then? Shall we live under a spruce? Think! Let's sell the house and buy a farm. I'm a farmer. And my kids would be raised with their feet in the ground. This house is on my name and I will only leave it for my funeral. Jorh, you may be a trained farmer but leave us alone. I'm a tailor, I'll save some money and improve my skills in Paris. And then I'll open up my store: "Company Bruno Benno Bernhard Kiir". You shithead, start by visiting the neighbouring village! Oh my God, he'll burn the kid! Just look at the golden rye. God is really merciful. Ülesoo fields have started to be plentiful again. We've had enough trouble here. - Yes. Hello! Be well. That's needed. The crops are good! Joosep, I'd like to have a word with you. Then speak. - Not here. If I'm not wanted here, let me go outside. A young kid has a light foot. He blabbers about everything he sees and hears. I'd like to take out a small loan. And your name is well-known. Could you just sign here? I'll pay it back myself, don't worry! Here's the document. - Swell. Let's go and ask about it. - From whom? You don't mean Teele? - Who else? Ülesoo farm has prospered only thanks to Teele. It used to be just a load of debts. But if they start talking all over Paunvere... - Teele won't talk. Teele is the only one here with some man's sense in her. Joosep! - What now? Enough! Here you are. Are you expecting young ones? No... Thank you. I haven't even been to your new house... I come with a purpose. Teele, so what shall we do with our schoolmate? We cannot send him off without a signature. Don't do this. Don't sign it! You'll suffer the consequences! - You know, bell-ringer... You were eavesdropping? - Of course. An inner voice told me that Kristjan Alfred, your best friend will be... Kiir wanted to be a farmer already before the Great War. When he asked for my hand. Let him try his luck again. - Oh God! - Wait. The conditions. There must be some offspring who could inherit the place. This won't be a problem. All right. Silk thread... Just look at it. We have stuff that you won't see anywhere else. Just pick anything. These are good old Engelsberg knives and forks that I ordered from the man himself before the Great War. I don't know what to take. As we're old acquaintances, I'll take a commission of just 20%. Mr Kiir, you have a lucky hand. Open the goods. You don't have the goods that would interest me. - So? Then we'll go to Germany and order from Engelsberg himself. Jorh! Jorh wants to buy a farm. A farm? A farm. A good farm is like a gold mine. Mr Kiir enjoys the best years of his life. Who says I don't have a farm? I have a number of farms. Some even come with a mistress. Jorh, why are you so set on that farm? You know nothing about farm work, Juuli knows nothing. Would you like to be a farmer's wife? I like everything I'm told to do. You're not a proper wife if you agree to everything that the whirlwind raves about. Quite right, dear lady. A man is his woman's head and the woman is her man's neck. Buy it now. A couple of dozen knives and forks for luck in the place we're about to buy. I'll pay. There it is! Pretty as a bird's nest. Shut up! Stop it! Hush! What are you looking for? - We've come to buy the farm. They said it was for sale. - What are you rambling about? Who are you, anyway? - Stop fussing, we're right men. We've got documents with us. Documents! You've come to rob the place at the light of day. Linda! There are scoundrels about. Linda, my revolver! I'll plug you so that it hurts! Linda, are you mad? You'll shoot the pig. Let go! Give me back my property! Give me back my property. Where are you taking the pig? Lay low, Mr Kippel, he will shoot you dead. Let go of the pig now. - What pig? I'll show you, you crooks! Stop! Where's the man going? Where's he coming from? - Pihlaka. No, not from Pihlaka. I'm the master at Pihlaka. Ants Paavel, former gunnery captain. What's your business at Pihlaka? We want to buy the farm. Which one of you wants to buy? - Us. That means me. Heinrich Georg Aadniel Kiir, tailor from Paunvere. My old soldier's ears have heard everything but for the first time I hear of a tailor wanting to buy a farm. All right, hop on. Thank you. So that's how you come home! That's the way one goes to the mill! Liisi, I want to introduce you to these gentlemen. They want to buy our farm. Why would you like the farm? I want my inheritors to live on their own land, in their farm like proper Estonians. Do you have some inheritors already? - They'll come. I don't want any kids. It's like a prison now but if the kids follow you about and caterwaul... You can make a couple of trips to the city but then... I don't want to think about it! Let's have a look at the farm. Seeing is believing. You too, Mr Salesman. Men, let's go! Lower it. How much do you want for the place? - 6,000 kroons. 6,000 kroons? That's quite a fancy price. The farm is fancy as well. And the price includes all farming equipment and other animals? No, movables are for extra. Is it too much? - Not quite but... But can you take it down a little and leave some of it on credit? No, I must do something with the money I get for the farm. The price is too high for me. You won't be buying then? Mr Paavel, give us our final price and then we can speak again. In about a week. Do you sell clothes? - No, Ma'am. I don't have any of that. - Really? What about powder and facial cream? - None of that. There's not a lot of demand for this. - Why do you ask for things like that? I'd buy a few books of fiction. I've never been asked books before. Sometimes they ask revolvers and ammunition. But I don't have trading rights for this. - Let's step inside. To your health, Mr... - Mr Kippel. Mr Paavel, why do you want to sell a good farm? Mr Kippel, we've been toiling away here for years. But no inheritors. And none will be coming now. Yes? I don't want any kids. They say that writer Oskar Luts is at Paunvere. Where does he spend the night? - At Raja. - That's what I thought. We've got a little club of bookworms and we wanted to ask him for a tea. He's from here, after all. I don't think he'll come. He has escaped here from the rattle of the world. But I'll tell him about it. Very well. If you happen to see him. Won't he take the carryings on of Toots and the seamstress to heart? Oh no. - Of course. Ülesoo farm can pay the alimony, no problem. What alimony? There's a subpoena to Mr Joosep Toots. Maali, the sister of Kiir's wife, wants some alimony. So it's in court already? - That's right. Riks! Leks! Lible. Do you know where the boys are? - At the paddock with Toots. What's the matter now? Don't you ever be careless while inviting guests. Because some of them may be just as insolent to come. Don't be like that, dear schoolmate. Quite to the contrary, it's good that some are true to their word. But tell me, what's happening at Paunvere? At Paunvere? You should know better. I meant your books. How's everything there? I've been tinkering with them. Maybe the peace and quiet helps. Just don't make me into a dove like I was in "Spring". I'll try to invent a few thorns for you then. You don't have to invent any for me. I have enough of them already. You're right, Teele. - And some of the thorns are sharp. There are a few other characters. Like Toots. You only speak about his tricks but he does have his inner beauty. Why not? That's the way with everyone. Kiir's no exception. Kiir is happily married now. Well-well? Kiir is happily married now? Is that you, Jorh? - Maali. Put your hand on your heart and tell me if you can lend me some money. Lend? I have put aside a little but I doubt it will help you a lot. It doesn't matter how much. Anything would help me right now. I'm ready to give up my... last skirt. But... What about this? Maali, that's just why I want to buy the farmstead. Then we can leave Paunvere. And we can do everything... Just as we like. Dear God, is it because of me? Because of you, dear Maali. I've thought about it a lot and that seems to be the best way. But what happens to Juuli? She'll come with us. Dear Juuli, I must tell you something. Soon we'll be moving into a farm that I'll buy. And you'll get a kid there. A kid? I can never get a kid. - Now you can. Because dear Maali has been up to a few tricks. - What tricks? Jesus! How could this have happened? Maali? - Maali's kid will stay with us. Do you agree? - Yes but... My God! But that's so horrible... So horrible... Please be sensible. Accidents like that have always happened to girls. - Stop it. The world won't stop because of that! Do you know who's the father of Maali's kid? How could I know this? But then we won't know whose kid we'll be adopting. We know it's Maali's kid. - But who's the father? Devil knows who the crazy guy was with whom Maali had a fling. Maybe he wasn't as crazy as that. He might have been a nice man. - So you have an inkling? Of course. Just don't tell anyone about it. Toots himself. Really? - Really. What would you like? This house will stand until I die. It's hard. The walls as well. I'm flax salesman Aaberkukk. Who are you? Mr Luts is a writer. - Ah, a secretary. Are you eyeing the maiden as well? Mr Aaberkukk, please come in. Hello. I need a spouse. I can recommend a good one. Is she a good wife? Can she cook? Yes, she can. And she has many other useful skills. Who's she? The sister of tailor Kiir's wife. But both of them are tailor's women. Kiir grabbed both for himself. Now he's made a kid to Maali. I can't do anything with her. That's no joking matter. Jorh Aadniel Kiir is not a stupid man. He bought himself a farm and two wives to boot. Now he's made a kid to Maali. I have no business with her. And whom do I see here! Hello, writer Luts. - Hello. I'm the boy who got his stripes from his Dad. In other words: The Lion of Kentucky. It's good to see old friends. What's new? - What can there be? Promoting life in Estonia, as schoolmate Funny would say. But life makes its corrections here. - That's for sure. Jorh Aadniel Kiir is not a stupid man. Bought himself a farm and two wives to boot. Now he's made a kid to Maali. Then there'll be a christening soon! Absolutely! Christian parents and relatives, would you like these kids to be christened in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... - Yes. - Too soon. Then tell me "yes". - Yes. There's no water. - No water! Damned... Endel, I'm christening you in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Endla, I'm christening you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen! Dear God! Damn it all. Congratulations, dear schoolmate! - Thank you. Congratulations! - Thank you. - Jorh, do you have a toothache? You are Mr Lesta? - What won't stick will be made to stick. Thank you. - Congratulations. I heard that Kiir has bought a farmstead and became a farmer. Congratulations! - Is this any business of yours? It isn't. But if I had money, I would buy a farmstead as well. There has been some money. - But you have drunk it all. I wouldn't have touched a drop if it wouldn't make me drunk. In view of the importance of this day I'd like to wish to my best friend Heinrich Georg Aadniel Kiir, that he would live twice as long as Methuselah. And that he'd have three times as many kids as Jacob. To your health! I'm so happy for my friend that I'd make him a noble. A knight or a von. - You can make him the Knight of Pihlaka. Let's give him some spurs and a medal. Better make him a farmer. That's right! Come outside now, closer to the land. Drop down on your left knee! Funny! Kiir - for the first time, be a farmer! Kiir - for the second time, be a farmer! Kiir - for the third time, be a farmer! Stand up! Bow down, there's one more thing to do. Don't hurt me! - Don't be afraid. Hold him still. - What's that for? You know for what. Maali! - Juuli. Friends, let's go to Paunvere now! Let's look at the old schoolhouse where all of it began.
