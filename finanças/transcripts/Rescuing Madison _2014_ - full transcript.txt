Talk to me. - Madison park tickets, for her concert tonight. - I'm not giving you 1,800 bucks to go see some singer. - Then give me $600 so i can go by myself. - For one ticket? - I told you, it's madison park. - I have no idea who she is. I can't help you, i'm sorry. Go home, do your homework. - Like you did your homework? - And ride carefully. - Uh-Huh. - I love you, too. - ? only to fall, why did i ever think ♪ ? we could have it all ♪ - She's so good. - Yup.

Not very often. - I have only one rule in this life. Never go into business with family. - That's a good rule. - Hmm. And rad? He's better? - Different. He did revive her career, Gave her an amazing second chance. It doesn't mean i have to like him. - Yeah, just tell them that this song doesn't follow this. - Absolutely. - Uh, so, yeah. If we can just change that, that'd be good. - Rad leffler, go. - Hey, rad. Stephen stan, Jordan vanderpool's manager. - Oh, stephen. Look, whatever it is you want, I don't have time right now. - Wait a minute. You don't even want to hear what i have to say? - Okay, you have 30 seconds. I have to get back to madison. - With madison so hot right now, I thought we could generate some mega p.R. By placing jordan in one of madison's shows. - I don't mean to be rude, okay? But we don't need a has-Been Whose last hit was over two years ago weighing us down. - Rad. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, but-- Really? Sold out, baby! So are we good or we good? - I'm good. This place reminds me of the venues That i used to play when i first started. - Oh, i know, i know. We're only here for the acoustics. We will never sing in a joint like this again. - I didn't know you sang. - Okay, nobody comes in and out of here, all right? I want her to get some rest. - Oh, i'm right here. You can talk to me. - Ah, that reminds me. Before you hear it somewhere else, jordan vanderpool's Manager called me trying to force jordan into our little Show here, something about a surprise duet. - I don't mind that. Sounds like fun. We used to have good chemistry on stage. - Uh, if he was significant in the business still, then maybe. - Well, a year ago, i wasn't significant in the business. - And enter rad leffler.

I want you to take a nap, okay? Get some rest. - Okay. - We have a big show tonight. And you, a little less this, okay? Thank you. - He's right. What jordan did, why would you wanna help him? - Because we're friends, jess. I mean, we still talk every once in a while. It's not like i'm into him or anything like that. We're just friends. - Really? Is that why you haven't dated Anybody since you and jordan broke it off? - That is not true. I went on a couple dates. It's just that both of those guys wanted "their" version Of what they thought what madison park was and not me. - So, you're saying you want Someone who doesn't know who you are? - Yeah. Kinda. What are they doing? - She's gonna try to get some sleep. You want to get some fresh air? - I think i should stay. - Come on, she's good. You'll have enough to do later. - Okay.

No new girlfriend. - That's not true. He has a new one. I saw it on tv. He didn't even get me an autograph either. - It wasn't the time and she's not my girlfriend. - Wait, who is this? Is this the girl from tv? From the fire? - Madison park. - Who? - Oh, man. You guys don't know anything. She's, like, the best all-Time singer ever. - Ever. - Ever? - I was just doing my job. I don't ask if they're famous before i rescue them. - Hey, did i ever tell you about the time I pulled two women out of a third-Story apartment building That was fully engulfed? All: yes. - Really? I don't think i did. - Ah, jordan. How's my favorite client? - Since when? It's an expression. Sit down. They said no. - No? - Rad said--And don't take this personally-- Madison doesn't need a has-Been on the bill with her. - Has-Been? "Don't take it personally." How do i not take that personally? - Ticket sales for your tour are really slow. We need madison. You need to call her yourself. Circumvent rad if you have to. Rekindle your romance, man. Pull that player out and woo her. - I dumped her publicly. I mean, i-- - But-- - Look, we are friends again. And trust me, it took a lot just to get that. - That leaves us one option. We can cancel the tour. - You know, i'm starting to like this whole madison idea You got going. I like it. - You like it? - I say we do it. - Come on, man. Come on. - All right. - Come on. All right. Go get that woman. - All right. - Yeah. - Hey, thank you. - Thank you. Write a song about her. - Rad, what are we doing here? - You are gonna chill. There's way too many distractions at the hotel, Considering what just happened. So, this is a private residence that i rented. - Nice. - Yeah. It's a controlled environment. It's quiet. You're gonna be able to rest, recuperate, And most importantly, nobody's gonna be able to find you, Unless we want them to. - Which eventually, you'll want. - You're not helping me. Not even a little bit. - I like it. Let's give it a quick look, But i have that date with the fireman. - Listen, this is very important to me. I want your word that you won't alert the press. He deserves a quiet dinner. I deserve a quiet dinner. - What good does it to anybody if you're together And i can't exploit it. - I'm having dinner with him because i want to, Not for publicity. He saved my life. - This makes no sense. - I'm serious. No press. Child. - No press. - You always travel in limos? - Well, not always. I'm from new york. And so i, um, i took trains and subways and cabs for gigs For a few years. Then i met rad and he signed me and gave me a new career. And we recorded an album and it's quite successful. I guess you can say that this is my comeback. - That's good. Everyone deserves a second chance. - How's the tour going? - Rad did this even though i specifically told him not to. - All right, step aside. Step aside, please. - Madison, madison, right here. - Oh, hey! You don't want to pay for that lens, man. - John! John, right here. - Madison. Madison, over here. Is this reward or romance? - Okay. Is this us? - Yeah. - Good. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Wait. - What? - Miss park. - Oh, thanks. - I know of a quieter place. - Well, i don't think we can do that. I think they'll just follow us. - Do you have a backdoor? - Mm-Hmm. - He's on a date with madison park and he's on the phone? - Yeah. I don't know. - That's really weird. I wonder who he's talking to. - Great. - Everything good? - Terrific. - Okay, i'm almost there. - Thank you. - Hey, let's go over here. - Let's go. Can you see through? - I need to use the ladies' room. Excuse me. - Where's she--Where she going? - I don't know. Bathroom? - Ugh, now that guy's not here. Come over here. - Madison park? - Billy. - You are beautiful. Thank you. - Where'd they go? - Where is she? - He's gone. They're gone. - There he is. - Hey. - What's going on? - Thank you so much for coming. - Ah, anything for you, buddy. Madison park in my car. All right. All right. Here we go. - Go around! Go around! Let's go! Let's go! - Perfect. I'm sick of this. - Come on, let's go. - I still don't know anything about you. Not the singer you, but madison. - Well... okay. Well, i started doing beauty pageants when i was five. And my mom and i would travel across the country to compete. And eventually, we focused on singing. When i was 16, i auditioned and was chosen for "touch." After that... how should i put it? I...hit the highest of highs And the lowest of lows. - Tell me about your family. - Wow. Where to start? I'm an only child. I don't really talk to my mom. See, my mom, she was like the typical stage mom That everybody feared. And then, she turned into the manager that everybody loathed, Including myself sometimes. I mean, she just made all the decisions And i kinda just went along like a good little girl. - She must have made some good ones. - She actually made some great ones. She did, she made some great ones. My career took off and soared. And i also believed a lot of the stuff that she told me, Like that i was a star and that i deserved And needed to be treated special. - I can't picture that. - Oh, yeah. I was a terror. - Where was your father in all of this? - My father was a police officer. And he risked his life every day just like you. Then one day... a robbery suspect shot and killed him. - Oh...i'm sorry. - I knew that it could happen. I mean, he told me that it could happen. But when it--When it finally-- Well, i mean, When it actually did happen, i didn't feel prepared. I wasn't ready for it. I miss him every day. - My father was a firefighter. We knew the risk too. - Is he okay? - Mm-Hmm, retired and happy. - That's good. Uh-Oh. I think somebody from here must have called them. - Oh, yeah. There she is. - Let's get out of here. - Okay. - Hurry up, hurry up. - Shoot and run, shoot and run! - Okay. We'll go right here. - Okay. Okay. - We lost them. - Yeah? - They really are relentless. - Whew. Yeah, tell me about it. - I don't know how you stand it. - I get to do what i love best while making people happy. - Sing? - Yeah. I can handle all the rest. - You know what? Just call her again, please. Ugh, i knew this guy was trouble. - Straight to voice mail. - You know what? I'm calling the cops. - You know this could just be a nice date Where she doesn't want to be disturbed. - We cannot let this get that serious. This works as a publicity stunt, but it does not work In real life, and your job is on the line. - Over one dinner? - No, no, no. This starts over one dinner. It always starts over one dinner. This is serious, okay? I mean, she hid from the media. She's off with him and she turned her phone off. - The horror. - Look, i am right about this. I am always right about these things. I have a seventh sense, okay? That's why i am so successful. - Relax. She is thanking a very nice, Handsome fireman for saving her life. It's not gonna go any further than that, i promise. I won't let anything derail her comeback. - I have a stomachache. - Tickets? Autograph for your sister? And you waited this long to ask me for that? - Yeah. I mean, if i'm asking too much or if i stepped over a line-- - Are you kidding me? You saved my life. - It's my job. - And you had no idea who i was Until your sister asked you for tickets? - You know they charge 600 bucks for tickets to see you? - Yeah, yeah, i do. It's just for a few seats upfront. - You must be a good singer. - Wait, you've never heard me sing? - Uh... okay, i'll take you home now. - Wait, no, no, no. First of all, You don't have a car right now, but second, I actually kind of like that. Vernon's here. - Well, i had a great time tonight. - Me too. So... - day after tomorrow? I work tomorrow. - Yeah, i would love that. - Good night. - Good night. - Next time, i'll drive? - Okay, whatever you want. - Yo, yo. Just got out of the studio. I got some great stuff. - Tell me you have a love song to madison on there. - No, not, like, specifically, but i got some love stuff. I mean, some good stuff too. - Nice. That sounds romantic. - It's dance music. Come on, you don't wanna hear it? - No, not really. - Why not? - Because if you don't have a tour to support it, It won't sell. Look, i may have gotten the record company to hold off On cancellation, so we're still alive, but madison is the key. You need to get her back in your life, And rad won't even answer my phone calls. - Don't look at me. Madison won't answer the phone. Okay, i don't know where she is. - You need to find her. - How was your night? - We had a good time. She's a nice girl. - Cathy down at the diner is a nice girl. Madison is like her own species. - Why? Because she can sing on key? - You just don't get it. - She's a down-To-Earth, lovely woman, who i think knows All the celebrity baloney is shallow. - Yeah, i could believe that. - She loves to sing. - That's all she writes about. - I should probably listen to some of them then, huh? - You think? - So? Dish. - I had a lovely evening with a nice man Just like any other regular woman. - In a chauffeured limousine in a $2,000 dress. Stop holding out on me. - It was amazing. We snuck out And we talked about family And feelings and... i don't think i've ever had a date like that. - He doesn't care about your career? - Nope, he's never even heard me sing. - Has he been living in a cave? - I actually find it kind of refreshing. - So seeing the firefighter again, yes or no? - Yes. - Okay, please--And i say this only because i have your best Interests at heart--Don't let this get you off track. Plus, rad's head will explode if it does. - Well, you know what, if it doesn't get on me, I'm absolutely okay with that. - Vernon, can you give me a ride someplace? - Anything for you. Where are you going? - Food delivery. ? oh, oh, don't wake me up ♪ ? if i'm dreaming ♪ - Wow, she's amazing. - That's what i've been telling you. I mean, she's like a whole nother level. - Hi. Hi, billy. - Hi, madison. - John, i brought you a snack. - Bye, madison. - Bye. I'm sorry. Was this too forward? - No. - Good. I made you a turkey sandwich and a fruit salad. - You made it? - Yeah. Don't act so surprised. - Sorry. - And i just wanted to make sure that you didn't forget About tomorrow. - Not a chance i'd forget. - Okay, so i know that you're on duty and i know how that is. So, i'll just go. - Well, this was sweet And i'll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00. - 9:00? Wow, that early? - It's not that early. - It's a little early. - Okay, we'll do 11:00. - Thank you. - Dress comfortably, we're going hiking. - Hiking? Okay. That's--I'm excited about that. So, i'll see you tomorrow. - Bye, madison. - Did you call her yet? - I tried. Every time i call, it goes straight to voice mail. The one time i got her, she hung up on me. - Oh, that's not good. Why didn't you just go see her? - I did. I went to the hospital with flowers. She was already gone. - This is not good. You need to-- - To what? Have her fall back in love with me? Her album just sold, like, a gazillion copies. She has a sold-Out tour. She doesn't need me. - Yeah, and after yesterday, she couldn't be riding any higher. Old rad must be beyond happy. - Hey. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah. - Tell me a funny childhood story. I'm not sure you want to hear My funny childhood story. - Why not? - Not yet, at least. - Hello, my people. Where is the amazing madison? Do not tell me she's running late. We have a full day today. I have two interviews regarding the fire and a lovely photo op Of her revisiting the scene. - She's not here. - What did he say? I thought you said, "she's not here." What's going on? - This looks like a good spot. - Yeah. Good spot for what? - Picnic. - A picnic with-- - Oh, ye of little faith. - I brought this up here earlier to surprise you. - Guess what, i don't care. I really don't. Find her. Get her back here now. This is unacceptable. - Okay, rad. Let me repeat myself since you don't listen to anyone Who holds differing opinions. - Vernon, don't. - Her mom never let her have a life. She needs to have one. And she can't sing right now Anyway and she doesn't need any pressure coming from you, So back off. - Really? Guess what. You're fired. How about that? - You can't fire me. - I just did. Now, go. - Please, guys. - And you, sweetheart, you're gonna be next If you don't figure out this little fireman thing. We don't need any distractions right now, do you understand? - Oh, rad, i was just trying to-- - Just stop talking and act. - Mmm. What is this? This is really great. - Chicken bruschetta. - Hmm. - I marinated the chicken overnight. - And you made this? - Mm-Hmm. Part of a firefighter's job description Is to cook for all the crew. We all have to do it. You made me a sandwich. The least i could do Is return the favor. - What are you going to do? - Nothing. Rad's all hot air. He knows he can't really fire me. I'm not going anywhere. - He seemed pretty mad. - I don't work for him. If madison wants me to go, i'm gone. - I know what you mean. I want what's best for her too, for her career. It's just that rad knows what he's doing. He's concentrating on her more than any Of his other clients right now, so-- - Doesn't mean you can't stand up for yourself when he's wrong. - I wish i was as tough as you. Tough's got nothing to do with it. I love that girl. I'll do anything for her. - Yeah. - What a great day. It's not real, but wonderful. - Is that madison park? - Yeah. Yeah, i think it is. - Oh, my god. - This is really my real life. - Hi, madison. - Can we take a picture with you? - Of course you can. Let me just put that down. - Thank you so much. - Of course. All right. Okay, you first? Ready? - One, two, three. - Do you want another one? - Thank you so much. Sure. - You're welcome, you're welcome. Perfect. - I listen to your album, like, every single day. - Aw. Thank you. - You are so pretty in person. - Thank you, sweetie. So are you. You're all so pretty. Look at you. - Thank you. Do you have any new shows coming up? - Yeah, do you have a new show coming up? - Yeah, do you? - I do have a show coming up. We're gonna reschedule it soon, But i'd love for you guys to come. It's a live taping. - Mm-Hmm, we'll be there. - Aw, that's exciting. That makes me very happy to hear that. - Thank you for taking a picture with us, madison. - Of course, of course. It was lovely to meet you guys. - Bye. -- You, too. Bye.. - Thank you so much. You are so sweet. - Thank you so much. - You're really good to your fans. - Thank you. - That was fun to watch. - Well, they made me who i am. I'm nothing without--Well, i'm nothing professionally Without them. Such a good time. - Yeah. Even when i was signing autographs. - Now, i told you, i got a glimpse into what you do. I saw how gracious you are. - Oh, and thank you for the home-Cooked meal. I don't really get many of those. - That wasn't a home-Cooked meal. It was a sandwich and a cookie. Now, my mother is a great cook. - Are you inviting me to meet your parents? - I didn't mean for it to sound like that. - Why? Why? I-I mean, i kinda like the way that sounds. I would love to meet your family. And i could take care of that thing for your sister At the same time. - Oh, that. You don't need to-- - It's really not a problem. And i'm pretty sure it'll get you some extra credit If i deliver it myself. - You got that right. Well, i should-- - Oh, yeah. Yeah, i should--I should-- I should go inside. - Thank you. - Mm-Hmm. - All day? - Yeah. - Rad blew a gasket. - Ugh, god. I'm allowed to have a personal life. - Yeah, your fireman tell you that? - What is your problem? - Rad fired vernon because he let you go today. - Not again. He knows he can't do that. - Vernon didn't go anywhere but, you know, I just feel like this is getting out of hand. I thought your career was your life. - No, my career is rad's life at the moment. It's only part of mine, finally. - One time you told me when you want it all You usually end up with nothing. - You know that i want a career, but i also want a personal life. John is a super sweet, Super classy, nice guy. We're just good friends, okay? Although, i am meeting his parents For dinner tomorrow night. That's it. - Oh. - Thanks for meeting me, man. - Not a problem. Tell me something, quick question. Why the sudden change of heart on the jordan-Madison idea? - "A," it'll help me reign in madison a little bit, But "b," i think it'll sell some tickets for your boy, So you don't have to cancel his show. - Well, i don't know about all that. I just thought it'd be fun for the kids. - Come on, man, please. Jordan's entire persona smells like failure right now, But i have a plan that can change all that. - You have to tell me everything. Isn't she a wonderful singer? - Krissy, she's a nice person And yes, she's a very good singer. - She sang to you? Oh, i can't believe it. - No, she didn't sing to me. - You gonna see her again? - I have to go. I'll see you soon, okay? I love you. - Not fair. - Oh, wow. - Surprise. - Jordan? - You like them? They're your favorite. - Oh, these are from you? - Don't tell me you have someone else sending you roses. - What is this about? - Look, i almost lost you in that fire. It was a wakeup call for me. - You don't have me to lose me. And how did you know where i was? - Been trying to contact you. I finally got through to rad. I asked him, he told me. Come on. He knows we have a history. - Yeah, ancient history. - Yes, it is, but that doesn't mean We can't make history again. - What do you want? - I just want to be together again. Come on. Like old times. Don't you remember? - Well, that's not happening. - Look, if i meant anything to you, let's go out tonight. Just see what happens, come on. - I already have a date tonight. - With john, a firefighter? - Jordan, what's going on here? What is this? - Rad and stephen think this is for the best. You need to leave. - Come-- - You do. - You don't understand. - Yes, i do understand. Rad is scared that i'm no longer some malleable Young singer with stars in her eyes. - That's not it. - That's what's happening. - That's not it, okay? - You know what, can you give rad a message for me? - Yeah, i guess. - Okay, tell him that we are no longer his pawns. - So this means we're not getting back together again? - Thank you for the flowers. - Mm-Hmm. - Did you have a part in this? - The roses are beautiful. - Yeah, rad's gonna have to pay a fortune for them. - Rad? I thought they were from jordan... or maybe from your fireman? - Stop. Why, jess? Why are you a part of this? I thought we were friends. - We are friends. Rad isn't the enemy here. He saved your career. - Yeah, i know that. But i met a nice man who makes me happy Every single time i think about him. What's wrong with that? - Does john know that his every move will be scrutinized By a rabid media waiting for your relationship to fail? - No. - They're going to examine every inch Of his life, every inch of his family's life. They're gonna camp outside his work. Do you really want that for him? - No. - I feel like you should let him know and he can move on. He's a nice guy. He doesn't deserve that. Break up with him now And it was a great adventure for him. Break up with him in a year, it's gonna be on The cover of every magazine at the grocery checkout counter. - All right, jess. Thank you, sweetheart. - You're welcome. - Look, you're not gonna regret this, okay? And remember, it's always better to stick to the buttered side Of the bread, all right? - I'll remember that. Bye. - I'll talk to you later. - Hey, there. - Hey. - I'll be over in about 45 minutes to get you. - Yeah, listen, i can't make it. I'm really sorry. - Really? You can't make it? - What happened? What's going on? - Yeah, i just-- I'm double-Booked. I have this interview. Rad set it up and i totally forgot that i said yes. It's to let the fans know that i'm okay. - Oh, you're more than okay. I'm glad i didn't tell krissy you were coming. It was gonna be a surprise, but i completely understand. - Well, i had your sister's tickets and picture All set up to go, so i could just have vernon drop Them off by the fire station tomorrow, okay? - Rather you brought them yourself. - Vernon will just bring them. I just don't know when i'll have free time soon 'Cause the tour's getting ready to rev back up. So... - Oh, okay. Well, give me a call when you get a break. I'd love to see you again. - I will. I promise. Bye, john. - Bye. - What happened? - I think she just blew me off. Hey, i'm here. What's up? - I thought you'd like to go for a ride. - Oh, yeah. I don't know. - Then go back to your room and sit alone, Feeling sorry for yourself. - Hey. - You need to get out. I know you. You need this. - You know, you remind me of my dad sometimes. - Nicest thing you ever said to me. I'm not used to you being up here. - I prefer the view from here better. And i did need to get out. - You need more than that. - What? - You need to listen to your heart and not your manager. - Were you eavesdropping? - Every word. So what's the real problem? - He doesn't know what's involved in this. He just won't get it. - John's a man. He's not one of those pampered pop stars from your past. He can decide for himself if it's too much for him. You don't need to be deciding for him. - Okay, but-- - And you need to decide For yourself whether you want the rads of this world Dictating what's good for you for the rest of your life. - But jess said-- - Jess loves you, And she's concerned about you. Now, don't you ever doubt that. You want to get to know this john? Is that what your heart says? If not, let's go home. If so... - i was supposed to go to his parent's house for dinner, But i have no idea where it is. - It's right there. And you're gonna need these. Tickets and an autographed picture. - What would i do without you? It's a two-Way street. Now, go. - I love you. - Go away. And i'll let the fireman give you a ride back to the house. - Okay. - Okay. - I'll get it. - What was it? What did it turn out to be? - Some woman left the toaster on and-- - No, get out of here. - Yeah. - Hi. You must be krissy. I'm madison. It's really nice to meet you. Okay. Um, john? - You came. - Yeah. I had some help reassessing my priorities. But right now, i think that the priority is krissy. - Krissy, snap out of it. - What's going on? - Hi. - Dad, this is madison. - Hi. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. - What's wrong with her? - Madison park. - Yes. - You are, like, the greatest singer ever. - I think that may be a slight exaggeration, but thank you. - No, really.

I know it. - I was really hoping that you would say that. - Okay, wait. I'm confused. I thought you told me she wasn't seeing him anymore. - Vernon took her. - And how do you know that? - He told me and then he told me To stay out of her personal life, And then he went up to his room. - Why can't he stay fired? - Why can't i call my friends? - Because then it becomes an event Instead of dinner with a friend. - But they won't believe she was here. - Well, krissy, we'll take pictures together and-- Actually, i brought you something That might help convince them. I'll be right back. Excuse me. - Oh, that's so sweet of you. - You need to marry her. - What? - Krissy, you're acting like a 10-Year-Old, sweetie. - Sounds good to me. - She's very sweet, sweetie. - Look, you're a catch.

This is the house where madison park is recuperating From her brush with death last week, Where she almost perished in a fire at the concert hall. It's late. Her fireman hero, john kelly, Whom she spent the last several days with, Has long gone back to his world. Then a lone man appears and sneaks into the building Where madison is the sole guest. Could he be up to no good? Yes, girls, it's jordan vanderpool, Madison's former flame. A man who doesn't have to sneak anywhere to get what he wants. He looks like a man on a mission. Are we seeing the start of a new madison-Jordan partnership? Let's ask madison's manager, rad leffler. Rad, are madison park and jordan vanderpool A duet once again? - No comment. - Oh, come on, rad. Really? You can't fool me or madison's fans. This fireman romance was just a big publicity stunt, Wasn't it? - No comment. - Oh, come on, rad. Really? - Madison park is a liar. - Honey.

I'll get back to you when i can. Thank you, mac. - You can't keep doing this to me. - Okay. No, i'll talk to you later. - Fine. Did you get that? - I got audio. - Good. - That was about the lowest, most underhanded, Disgusting thing i have ever seen. - Wait till you see what comes on live at lunch On the gossip news network. - Madison's gonna have you for lunch. - Madison is gonna thank me. - I can't do this anymore. I can't do this to my friend. I quit. - No, stop. Jess, please, what will i ever do without your help? - You know what, rad? Someday karma's gonna catch up to you.

What's up? - I was hoping maybe we could go get something to eat, You know, just you and me, no vernon, no jess. - Bite to eat? Yeah, i am hungry and i know of a place that's perfect. - Wow. I thought i was gonna have to talk you into it. - No. - Okay, great. Wherever you want. And maybe we could talk a little shop. After all, we have a tour to get back up on its feet. - Sounds good. - No, everything's all set up. - You're sure? - Okay? Just give me two minutes. - Two minutes? - Two minutes, you make your entrance. - My entrance. - Okay. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you today? - Good, thank you. - Okay, no more phone calls, no more distractions.

I mean, as long as you're okay with the new venues and dates, We are fine. - I'm okay with them, but can we sell them out? - Quicker than you think. - Well, i can think pretty quick. - Well, then you better start. - What's going on? - You can thank me later. - Hey, look, it's jordan. - Jordan? - Here she comes. - No questions. Just--Just stand for me. Please just--Just trust me. - Great stuff. - Madison park and i... were close at one time. As you all know, over the past few years, we've been apart. But recently, after almost losing her, I realized i just couldn't bear being without her. So i'm back... to spend the rest of my life with her, If she'll have me. - Oh, yeah. - Oh. - Madison... - Jordan... - i love you so much. Will you marry me? - Get a close-Up. - Oh. - What do you guys say? - Jordan, what made you do this? - Say yes, madison. - How could i say no? - Oh, that's wonderful. - Aww. - Jordan, kiss her. - He's going. - Wow. - Right here. - How can she say no? - How can i say no? Like this. Jordan, you and i have been friends For a very long time and we will continue being friends. But we're not going to get married. Ever. I'm sorry. And i'm sorry that you all had To come here to see this, but you've been fooled by rad. We've all been fooled by rad. - That is not actually correct. - You're fired. - What? You can't fire me. We have a contract. - Yeah, we did, and it clearly states that if you break The morals clause, the contract is invalid. So between what jess, vernon, and i have witnessed, I'd say i have a pretty good case. - Madison, can we just talk about this For one moment, please? - Bye, rad. - Do not make a scene like this. Please, let's talk-- Vernon, pull over. Excuse me. Vernon! - Rad. How does it feel to betray your star client? - Listen. I apologize for her. She is clearly under a lot of stress And pressure right now, okay? - So, is this the end of the two of you? - No, it's not the end of us. We will work that out. - She just fired you. - So i'm like--I'm shocked. I'm, like, freaking out, but it gets worse. But then she says, "we're not getting married," Right on tv. - Yeah, it--I just find the whole thing confusing. - Yeah, no kidding. Is she dating this jordan guy or not? - No. No, she isn't. Not at all. Oh, no. - What? - I tore up my autographed picture. - Once they clear it, we'll check the explosions. - Here we go, men. Get that equipment off-Loaded. All right. John, give me the line on the front door. - Okay, chief. - Get up there and let's see if we have anybody still inside. Billy, take out that front window before we get up there. - Will do. - Hey, joe.

I was doing a search and a section Of the ceiling collapsed. - Oh. I'm just happy you're okay. - Is madison coming to visit you? - I don't think so, unless she can use it To make herself look better. - What? - Everybody at the firehouse saw the jordan guy Sneaking in and him asking her to marry him. I don't think she's gonna break herself away From wedding plans to see me. - She didn't say yes to jordan. She said no right on tv. It was all a publicity stunt she had no idea about. She fired her manager on tv, too. - Really? - Really. - Yeah. None of it was true. - Did she call and check up on you? - No. - Then she probably doesn't know. - Honey, why don't you call her? - He can call her tomorrow. All right?

Nurse manuel to radiology. - I was never late when i had you helping me. - Well, i haven't been much of a friend lately either. - Let's go talk about it. - Why did you call me? I quit for a reason. I let you down. - We've been through a lot together. I've made mistakes too, you know. I let rad have free reign over all of us. - Not vernon. He stood up for himself. Me? I caved like a wet noodle. - So, uh... vernon told me that you quit over what rad did? - Yeah, but only after it had all been set in motion. I know how much this comeback meant to you And i was trying to protect that. - I know. Yeah. And i appreciate it. - Look, i'm not asking for my job back, But i would really like my friend back. - I'll tell you what. How about you have both back? You know i can't do any of this without you, right? What about john? - He called a few times and i let it go to voice mail. - Why? - You know, he's wonderful. It's really me. It's my problem. His job. He almost died in a fire the other night. Did you know that? I heard the whole thing and it just--It made me feel So much like what i felt when my dad was killed And i promised that i would never feel that way again. - Is he okay? - Yeah, he's going to be okay, thankfully. But as for us, i--I-- I don't think i can do it. I-I just--I can't. - I understand. And i'm here for you. - Hey. You know, it's good you're here until you feel better. - I'd rather be working. - I know. How are your ribs? - They feel better but i'm still sore. - Look, you're alive, you're home, you're feeling better, And yet you still look like The most unhappy guy in the world. It's her, isn't it? - I thought... - you had found... - a wonderful woman. I really felt like i'd never have to look for another one. - I still feel that way about your mom. - I can't imagine that comes along more than once in life. - Well, then why don't you do something about it? - I called her. I get voice mail or an assistant that says she's busy. I even texted her. No answer. - Doesn't your generation ever do anything face-To-Face? - I'd love to talk to her face-To-Face. I think she's made it pretty clear she's not interested. - You run into burning buildings for a living, And yet you're afraid of this beautiful woman? - Afraid? - Yeah. Afraid to go to her And have her tell you to your face that she doesn't love you. - Nobody said anything about love. - Nobody had to. - Hey. You have a visitor. - I don't want to see anybody right now. - I think you need to hear what he has to say. - Before you say anything, let me explain. I was desperate and i was wrong. I listened to a couple of nut-Jobs And not my own head. Madison, is there any way you could forgive me? Of course i can. But don't you ever pull a stunt like that ever again. - I won't. I swear. I--Come here. It's okay. - You know it probably would've been a beautiful wedding. - Oh, yeah. Real storybook. Let's decide on this right now though. - What? - Always friends? - That works for me. - Okay. Good. I lied, actually. There's one more thing I have to ask of you. It's coming from me. No one else, i swear. - Sure. Ask. - Could i sing with you on your live recording gig? It would really help my tour. - So what song do you want to sing? - Ah, yes. - Okay. I've been thinking about a few. - Why don't you sit and tell me what song you wanna sing? - Okay, all right. Sounds good. - Taking it out to get it washed? - Yup. That's the official version. - And if we get a call? - I'll be there. It's called a radio. - Need some backup? - Why not? - How do you know she's gonna be there? - A bird named vernon told me. - Let's roll. - Big bird. - How's rehearsal? - Lifeless sound good to you? - No. - Well, her passion for the love songs are gone. She used to melt hearts when she sang. Now, she's just gonna ice 'em up. - She keeps denying her feelings because of her fears. - Those fears are grounded in something real. - Yeah, well, when you build brick walls around you, The bricks only end up falling on you. - Tell her that. - She's not gonna listen to me. I had a better idea. - Had? - Mm-Hmm. - Hey. - Remember, you can't fire me. What? Mom? - What's going on? - Angela's in there. - Vernon. Nice going, buddy. - Well, you look great, really great. - I feel really great, sweetheart. I've kept busy. I'm going back to college and getting my degree. - In what? - Believe it or not, english. - Wow. That's-- That's amazing. - You've looked better. - Thank you for that. - You know when yolooked the best i've ever seen you? On tv, the night with the fireman when you were At the rental house dealing with all the media. I saw the way you looked at him. - Mom, please just don't go there. - I'm your mother. So, are you in love with the fireman? Mom, i can't stop thinking about him. - That's a strange way of telling me you love him. - It's too late anyway. I've driven him so far away that he's probably Fallen off the earth by now. What? What's happening? - I have something to say to you. Let me say it and then i'll go. First of all, I want to say-- - I love you. And i'm sorry that i haven't told you before. But i was just-- I was scared... to love you. - I love you too. - Ooh. Woo-Wee! - You know what she's doing? - John's in love.
