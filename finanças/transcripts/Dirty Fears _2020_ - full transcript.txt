Participants will merely be obligated to take part in an amusing game, leaving their cell phones... Turned off at the door till the play end. Their cell phones. Yes. Perfect. Hello,. No. Hello, I'm Marta, I'm tired of the monotony. I would be happy to, no. I'm Ava, I just had a fight with my husband. I just can't stand him sometimes. Yes, perfect. Just Ieva, Melina... Lavika, Leonara, Kalina, perfect. Hello, welcome. Melina and Lavika. Fantastic. I'll get your keys. Here's your room key. One second. And the rules. So you'll need them. Your room is on the second floor. - Okay. - And you are? - Yes, I am Ieva. - Welcome. Are you American? - Well, I live in LA, but I was born in Romania. - The country of Dracula. Wow. Fantastic. - Yeah, whatever. - These are the rules. To be adhered to. - That's okay, I understand Italian. No cell phones allowed? May I retire if I don't like it? - You'll like it. You'll like it. - Is that my key? - Yes. - Soon you'll be here. Obviously you cannot have high hopes. Humans have a very bad nature. You'll have to face and deal with hard tests. Just like your mom. But I will always be there for you. And I'm sure that Daddy will change. Yes. He always wants to boss me. I don't take orders. - Well, I don't know that being here was the best solution for me, as I have lost all of my family, and then I was like a world's orphan, it's like that. I don't have any destination and I don't belong to nobody. So I have an older husband which is like my parent, and now he really disappointed me, and I thought it's good to teach him a good lesson. It's a game. You can lose. And you can win. - Fuck you already! Woo! Yeah! - Hello? Hello? Come on, Robert. I know it's you. Don't play games, I'm still angry with you, okay? I want to be left alone, okay? I'll call you tomorrow. Please, God. Please, God. Oh, please. - Yeah, so. When I want to know the future, I read this, and now we want to know about this game. Yeah, it's like we have to concentrate. - Okay. - Okay? So let's concentrate. Okay. So now I'll put here 12 cards. Just like the month. - What do you see? What are the cards telling you? - I think I don't see them. Like it's me. It's me. - What's the problem? - It's not them. - Are you okay? - What are you seeing? - I don't think you're okay. - Ieva. The cards. Ieva. Wait. - You disgust me. I saw you kissing that man out there. God damn faggot. - Francesco's gone. He had a death in the family. Francesco's gone. See you in hell. - Don't you want to see your mother again? Don't you miss her? You still hate your mother? Yeah, you hate her, is that it? Don't you miss her? Do you ever just miss your mom? - No. - Well, if it means anything to you, she's not living in Albania anymore. Listen, pal. I'm a doctor, okay? That's my job. You gotta stay here for a long fucking time. Maybe forever. I'm your doctor, pal, you can trust me. But you ain't going nowhere. - I like it here. Seems like a hotel in the mountains. How can I help you? - Two lesbo sinners. Just kidding. Is the car yours? You can't leave it there. You have to bring it down into the garage. You go down that way, and then I'll let you in from the inside, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - I have heard some noises. You know. - Hey, Carlo. - Hey. - Hey. Has he got any friends, family in the city that you know of? - No. The mother has got a hotel. In the mountain. - Right. Yeah. All right. That's enough. Okay. - I will check. I will check in the documents. - Okay. All right. Ciao. - Ciao. - Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. My mother says you think you're superior to God. My mother says all you have to do is fuck a stranger, and then you could be forgiven. Huh? Huh? And so we have to forgive God. I'll give you a chance. You understand? Don't worry. You're not gonna die. Not this way. Mommy, I did it for you. No, no, no, no, no Nobody saw me. No, the crucifix, I put it away. Nobody saw me. Right. Now close your eyes and relax. Don't think of anything. Imagine you're on an island, walking on the beach. Barefoot. Relax. Relax. Relax. The wind... Is blowing through your hair. I'll be right back. - Help. Help. Somebody help. - Fuck you. Fuck you! - I already talk differently. It's useless. You have to face your destiny. I'll be right back. - Oh no. - I want you to tell me. Who do we start playing with first? Ravika, Melina, Leonora. Give me a nod, yes or no. And if you don't tell me, I cut off an ear. Snip! You understand? Good girl. Shh. Do you believe in God? - Si. - And do you love your daddy? - Si. - Shh, uh-uh-uh. Do you obey your mother? Tell me the truth. Honor thy mother and thy father. Wrong. I want one of you to at least be saved. I'm not mean. Which of you is a mother? Yeah. You're the mother. Oh, you're so cute. Mother and daughter. How cute! Not for you. A vacation together. How cute.

Where are you? Trying to be sneaky? Since one of you tried to escape, all of you are gonna pay. - This game is boring me, huh? You just don't understand! My mother said God forgives you. We failed, God's children. - May I come in? - Sure. - Thank you. - We're not equipped for handicapped access. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you speak English? - A little. How can I help you? - Okay. I'm an American, and my wife and I, my wife Ieva Lycos, we had a fight, and I know she came here. I've been trying to call her, but she won't answer the phone, so I got worried. So instead of going to the police, here I am. - Ah, Ieva. Yeah. She's here. - Come on. - Wait here. I'll go call her. - Thank you. - I want to stay sometime by myself. - I thought you'd love it here in Italy. - You know that I wanted to go to Romania. I've already lost all my family. Do you want me to lose my roots too? You always think about you and yourself, isn't it? - What are you up to now? - Doesn't matter. I'll let you know. Honey. Look who's here. You're really lucky. You get to look death right in the eye. Tick-tick, tick-tock. Time's up. He's gonna die. - It's all my fault, honey. - I am so sorry. - Honey. I'm going to have a baby. - You're going to have a baby? Oh my god. That's wonderful. - It didn't have to go this way. - I know. See how unfair life can be? To die at the hands of, because of, a psychopath. After so many years of suffering and struggles, when you finally find out you're really happy, and you found the right woman to spend the rest of your life with and share everything with. When you find out you're gonna be a father. A father. I never wanted children. I was always afraid to have them with the wrong woman and for them, having to leave them and make them suffer. But I'm sure our baby I'll be just like you. You must always tell him the truth, always. And you must tell him... You must tell him how much I wanted to live to see the way he grows. You are such a good woman. You are such a good woman. You will make... I don't want to be buried. I don't want anyone to cry for me. It's true what they say. When you're about to die, you can feel it. - Honey, no. - What are you most ashamed of? You don't want to tell me? My mother always ordered me around, and if I didn't listen to her, she locked me up in the dark and made me eat shit. Maybe I treated you too well. This little son of a bitch is gonna die. - No. No. No. - You. You're a mother? Tell me what you're ashamed of. Hail Mary, mother of God, the Lord is with thee here. - I lost him. My little angel. Follow your daddy. We'll all be together soon. Please let me help you. - Don't touch me. Did you hear it? - No. No. He's gone. He's gone. - Well, get him back. I want him to finish me off. Can somebody kill me, please? - No! Stop saying that. I know who he is, I know him. He was a patient of mine. When I first came to Europe, I worked in the asylum where he was there. Yeah. Worked for the Los Angeles police department, investigating serial killers. Psychiatrist as well as a cop. Very sensitive, I know a lot of things, I can feel a lot of things, and he's very dangerous man. Very dangerous boy. He killed his mother. Used to own this place. You know what, he's never gonna be happy, and he's never gonna stop. He's never gonna be at peace. Hell, can you send me an ambulance? He'll never be at peace. The bad things are the good things. You too cannot live. Come, come to me.
