Iqbal. Iqbal. Why aren't you up yet? Let's not miss the 8.30 bus. Hold on for three days, old bugger. Going for tea? Taj. -I've filled two pots. Did you go to the toilet? -I did. Should we withdraw our savings? -It won't be enough. But we have time till tomorrow. The cheque must be paid by tomorrow afternoon. If you ask him, I'll get mad. How about Salima? No, no. Last time I was a little late and such nasty words she used. Do you know what all she told Jameela? Let that go. By Allah's grace we'll find a better way today. Amma, give me some for twenty rupees. -Hurry up. I need to get going. For ten rupees. Dhas. Amma will be gone three days. Grandma will feed you. Eat without making a fuss, okay? Finish colouring the new books before I come back. Okay? How long? -Just two minutes and I'll shower. Remember what's coming up next week? -Yes I do. You must go to the mosque and inform the Hazrat. Get things ready for the Moulud recital. I won't forget, don't worry. It's getting late. Here. Sister, has Dasthagir left? -He's inside. Dhas... I was wondering... Not that, Dhas. Did you retrieve your gold chain? Don't even ask. I didn't pay the interest and now the jewellery is stuck. She's been pestering me for two days. I'm thinking of escaping to my sister's house for a few days. Iqbal will be alone, keep an eye on him. Everyone has a beard. Everyone wears a cap. Everyone goes to the mosque. But on the way back from worship you discuss the sermon. He talks about a black goat, but you call it white. Now is the goat black or white? A great debate follows, and the plot has shifted away from reflection upon God... How much for the paste? I'll pay you tomorrow. Useless debates. Should you wear a cap or not? Controversies on such trivial matters exist today... In another era perhaps men with greater intellect existed. It was wasted away on disputes and debates. Mosques and minars stood high there... but in the hearts of men there was no God. Only darkness. In the kingdoms where Islamic thought ruled... Muslims lived peacefully together. One such place where wise men lived was Oudh... which I visited to look at the great king's palace. Whenever the Hindu faith faces a trial... a divine force arises like a giant wave or a storm. India and Tamilnadu are ancient lands. Tamilnadu is a spiritual realm built by the sacred saints. Hindustan is one unified nation. A Land of spirituality. A Land of righteousness. Devilish forces persist and threaten to breach... destroy and enslave this country. But the Hindu faith will help us stand strong and tall. Today, danger advances on our motherland. Invaders, migrants, traitors and rebels seek... to corner Tamilnadu and destroy it. Amma, are you doing well? -I'm fine. This is Taj, my wife. Two arm-lengths. -Jasmine? Here. See you. Three of eight bundles are arranged. I will call you once work is over. I've kept aside some tomato pickle. Have some of it with lunch. That one. Do you really have to go? Be safe. -God willing, I'll be back soon. See you. Sorry I'm late. All roads are blocked for the festival procession. The boys in my area are in such high spirits. You could have taken leave and had fun. -When do I ever get leave? Bhai, did you hear? -Tell me. Our Nandini has a new boyfriend. -Careful. Lower it slowly. Is it? -Yes, bhai. That's good news. And then? I've come to the shop. Will this movie at least be a hit? I'd call it a hit if it runs for a week. Has the new stock arrived? -These are new. Say red and I'll pick it out for you. Brother, I asked for blue. See the checked one there? This one? -The one above that. This? -Above that. The first one. This one is okay. Will I get a 40 in this? Is this 40? -This is size 40. Okay, this is alright. The same with white mixed in? -This does have white, mixed in softly. It does... Will I get these at a lower rate? -Fixed price, madam. But you pick them out, pick two and we can negotiate. You don't have any new models? -These are new arrivals. The red one? -This? This will suit sir's complexion very well. You don't tell me that. That violet one? This one? -Yes, this one. The one below that too. That black one. Yes. That one. Here's green, black, another green. -I asked just for the black. That's not available. Take the pink one from the top. -Look at this one. See how it looks on her. -That netted one. How about this? Superb this is. -A bigger size than this. A bigger size? -Yes. Look at this one. Made just for her. Not the orange, get the pink. -Not the orange? The one on top. These are old models, pick from these. Why designs in inners? Bring us four of those. Pick from this. They are the same price. Only the colour is different. Does design matter in inners? Just take four of the plain ones. Which ones? -The one with the small checks. Small checks? -The small ones. Yes. This one. -Yes. Is this your mother-in-law? -Sister-in-law. This will suit you quite well. -That's why I like this kind. What other colour? The yellow? -Yes, show. I'll show you yellow and other colours. Take your pick. And for you? You can choose one too. -Yes, show me. Do you have grandchildren? -Yes, I do. I'll show you sarees that suit grandmothers. Yes, that's what we want. Nowadays, all grandmothers wear sarees like these. Don't say all of them do. Only a few of them do. The grandmothers of our city do. -The old have gotten fashionable. Some grandmas wear chudithars. Would you wear them? This is quite enough. This one is super. -Do you like it? Let me open it for you. What? The procession shouldn't enter their streets? The arrogance of Muslims. Speak to Ganesan. Ask the party men to throw stones at their streets. Who cares about the police? We've given them enough money. Didn't they turn a blind eye to our antics the other day? Why must we fear? Bullshit. The Muslims should fear us. Or else they'll take over. Hello, Manickam. Are you doing well? How's business? It's alright. The season's been a little dull. Why have you lost so much weight? -You also think so? And I didn't even get lunch today. Why? Can't she bring my food? Or if she doesn't, she thinks I will not eat? Suggest a good restaurant, let's go eat. Annapoorna has nice soft idlis It also has super pongal. But the chutney-sambhar are not spicy enough. In Vasanth Bhavan, apart from the coffee and dosa, nothing is edible. Aryas is the best for vadas. For hot Mysore bondas and tomato uthappams Anandhas is the place. But the servers there are good for nothing. There's one dark man with a beard... You can't go near him. An overpowering stench of sweat. Give your order to anyone but him. Aruljyothi has superb paper-roasts. Our chef from Royal Cafe works there now. He has made the place famous for paper-roast. RHR has soft pooris, but their idlis are like rocks. Their dosas are fit to make slippers. Our Amuda Surabhi... The idiyappams and coconut milk are pure nectar. You have to try them. Also... In Gowrishankar... the gulab jamuns and vadas are fantastic. But if you want a complete meal, head straight to Alankars. It will be superb. Is it? -Yes. Come. Let's go eat, then. I don't go to hotels much. I'm going home to eat. -Just this once. No, I have to go home. You go ahead. It would be nice if you came along. -That's okay. You go ahead. Some day, then. -Sure. Three bales have arrived. The cashier has asked me to pick them up. Can you deliver his son's lunch -Yes, I'll do that. Bhai, I've parked the cycle near the Sait's shop. Nasir bhai. Salaam-Alaikum. Rahman, how are you? When did you come back? Last month. -You didn't tell me. My daughter's marriage has been arranged. I wanted to invite you. Fathima is getting married? Happy to hear this. I came to shop for the wedding clothes. I was about to go eat, and ran into you. Come, let's go eat together. Iqbal must be waiting at home. I need to eat and return to the shop. Another day? -Nothing doing. It's been so long. We must catch up. You can't go. We'll eat at the wedding. That is a wedding meal. This is a meal of friendship. You must absolutely come. With your help, I performed the Hajj. After that, I got a job in Abu Dhabi. If you had come along, we could have performed the Hajj together. In the eyes of the cosmos I am but a speck. And the cosmos in my eyes? You're still the same Nasir. Shall I talk to my boss? He owns a jewellery shop in Abu Dhabi. He'll take good care of you. If you go there... you can make some money and look after the family too. How long will you roam around these market streets? Bhai, it's good that we met. God willing, I'll give this some thought. What is taking you so long? Nasir is here, bring it soon. Two minutes. Avial tastes good only when it's hot. Bring it quickly. -What taste? Eating the same avial and tamarind curry has killed my taste buds. Nasir, let's go someplace nice to eat tonight. Being a chaste vegetarian, how dare you crave for outside-food. To hell with your tongue. What does this fool know about chaste vegetarians? Nasir. It's been a while since I looked at Playboy magazines. If you go to Ukkadam, get me some new collections. Kishore Candy it seems. -Kishore Candy? Insta. -In Insta? Your crush. -Oh, shut up. Really, his id on Insta is Kishore@Candy. I looked on Facebook and couldn't find him. You can find him only on Insta, not on Fb. If it is near your house, won't we be caught? Where else can we find a caf√©? -There's one in Race Course. Laddu. Don't you want your lunch? -Uncle, what are you doing here? You already started eating? Who is that? Hello. Leave now. I'll tell you tomorrow. Will he tell on us to your parents? -No. No problem, right? -He's my friend. He won't tell. How will you come? -I'll take the bus. But my folks won't let me go out alone. I'll come with a friend. Iqbal. What are you up to? -Drawing. Amma, did Iqbal eat? Nandu... Do you have any new videos? I sent you everything I had. What use is just watching? Brother... Watching is a different kind of high. You won't understand. Bhai, have you eaten? -Do we not eat every day. Don't be so grumpy, bhai. Did Begum leave? I saw her off by bus this morning. -Now how will you manage the night? Disgusting. You have nothing else to talk about? What's disgusting? They'll act like they don't want it. We must be smart and get the job done. 'Enough, enough' they say, but it is never enough. I have been through it all, so listen to me. What exactly have you been through? -Bhai, don't you know? You know our man frequents the cinemas at night. One such night he was away... and an auto driver crossed his wife's path. Our guy returns home early without getting a ticket... and catches them both in the act. He stayed only because his father-in-law begged him to. And at the juice shop you creepily groped a girl. What about that? Nobody is a saint here. Not everyone is like you. It looks like you're on your way to becoming a pimp. Maybe. Isn't that a profession too? Get lost, man. Bhai, you tell us something interesting. -I have nothing as exciting. Bhai, come on, out with one of your old poems. I have no poems to tell. For now, I have to write a letter. People have moved on to phone-video calls. You're still stuck with letters. Bhai, recite one of your old poems. no hold have I on life neither any grievance I am not a simpleton to hate it but today at the evening of my youth I stand on one bank of silence merciless time flows in spate to rest in centuries on the other bank loneliness comes down in rain my dear friends poet Nasir asks what else is life if not loneliness and silence? Amazing, isn't it. -Bravo. To the one with the softness of a thousand roses. And the radiance of a thousand moons. To Begum Taj, the one dearer to me than life. Thus writes Nasir, slave to your love. As I saw you off today morning... my heart fluttered strangely. Just as I crossed the corner of Raja street... a flute seller was playing the first line of our song. The first song I sang to you. As soon as I heard the tune I was reminded of our wedding. In the van, on the way to Abdul Hameed uncle's in Kotagiri... as you sat gazing out of the window... I sang softly into your ears: She is the spring of seasons. When I sang: 'She is the jasmine of flowers'... you tightly held on to my hands. Today morning when I heard the flute, as I walked through Uppukinaru street... all the lines of the song came back to me. The sales tax officer threw my files around, the motherfucker. My accounts are wrong, says the motherfucker. My accounts are always spot-on, motherfucker. You want a bribe? Take it. Don't blame my accounts. Who doesn't take a bribe? Ministers, MPs and MLAs, all take bribes. Since 1968... I've made an honest living out of the snacks business. Take your bribe and get lost. Manickam, can I get an advance of 5000 rupees on my salary? The expenses at home have increased. You're asking at the wrong time, Bhai. Our stock hasn't moved since a week. You know, right? We have to sell 1% of our stock every day to make a profit. Bhai. Come on. These blazers haven't moved in a week. Deliver them to those college guys. And keep the money. Okay? The bills. Here, you can take my scooter. They say Ganesh is not a Tamil God. I ask, was Allah born in this neighbourhood? They say Ganesh Chathurthi is not a Tamil Festival. What is our goal? To convert Tamil Nadu into a Hindu state. This is the land of Ganesh and the Hindus. Not of scumbags. I hope you have reached safely. Iqbal ate in the afternoon. The house feels desolate without you. Though it's only for three days, I do not like it much that you are gone. They invite you not as family... but as an extra hand to help at the wedding. When you understand this, I hope your anger for me will subside. The next two weeks should be smooth. Raja has got heaps of orders. He is truly the king during festival season. For the next two weddings... he has asked me to supply flowers for the stage decoration. He passed along the numbers of the clients. I couldn't believe it. Once you're back, we will purchase all the grocery. By then, I should get my salary With that money we will finish all the scans and tests for Ammijaan. Hey. What are to doing? This is a place where students study. You can't smoke your beedi here. Sorry. I've come to deliver coats in the boys hostel. Go to the building at the corner. Hello? Where is the boy's hostel? That way. Brother. Where is room 201? -That room. Don't keep sucking it all by yourself. Not one of our boys. Is Rajesh here? -Why? I've come to deliver his coat. -He has a fever. He is asleep. I've come to deliver Moses's coat. -Did I ask for it? I'll collect it next week. She made the first move, asked me what I am studying. I was not the one who spoke first. Why are you taking this so seriously? You are always arguing with me. Brother? I'm telling you again and again. I did not approach her first. She came to me. Is Harikrishnan here? -He will be in the department. When will he be back? -He'll come by night. Come to add to my pile of troubles. No, just someone random here. What name did you mention? -Harikrishnan. There he goes, go nab him. Brother. Are you Harikrishnan? -Yes. I've brought your coat. 650 rupees. Vande Mataram. Himalayas to Kanyakumari. One nation, one religion. All hail Mother India. Lord Ganesha, bless us. Sister, come here. Here, sister. What do you want? Take a look, step inside, sister. We have many new collections. Take a look. Cotton sarees, handloom sarees, many kinds, come. Brother, we have jeans and T-shirts on discounts. Hey kid, go in and take a look. What do you want? We have churidar materials too. Brother. Jeans, T-shirts, they're all inside. Here's some fine spun cloth. How much for a metre? -Rupees 130 for a metre. Do you have pant cloth? -Let me show you some pant cloth. It will fit. If this doesn't fit, you can exchange it. We're always open. Even on Sundays. Last time I got it from here. -From here? No worries then. How much for this? -Sister, this is 450. 450 Rs. It's very nice. -And this will be 550. Would you like to see these varieties? -Show me. Choose whichever one you like. There are many colours in this variety also. Shall I show you this? -Yes, show. Yes, keep this aside. What other type would you like? There are other models there. -Let's see. That green one. -This green? There are many checked ones. Run. There's a riot in Ukkadam. They're breaking and burning shops. Run. See you tomorrow. -Okay, bhai. Five minutes and everything would have been over. Amma, four idlis and two dosas. I had given my mixer to Dasthagir for repair. Do remind him. It is apparent that Ammijaan's health is failing. How many more days can she carry the cancer in her womb? God willing, we shall find a way to treat it. It is difficult to see her curled up like a foetus... unable to bear the pain in her abdomen. After all, her body has endured hardships all these years. Even today she walked all the way to Kotamedu to see aunty Noor. She has sent along half a dozen eggs and some fish. As I was returning after lunch... I saw Iqbal looking at the photo of his parents and drawing. I could not meet the Hazrat today. Tomorrow I will meet him for sure... Tell him about the death anniversary of Iqbal's parents. Get everything ready for the prayers. Luckily, I ran into Rahman Bhai today. He is back from Abu Dhabi. It seems Fathima is getting married. How fast time flies. I asked him if he could get us some money on interest... to get Iqbal admitted into a special school. He promised to put together some money tomorrow. You stay calm there. He said another important thing. He told me to take up a job in Abu Dhabi. Once you're back... Look there, a Muslim. Nab him. Catch him. Hail Mother India. We must wipe out his race. Hail Mother India. Leave this country, you dogs. Hail Mother India.
