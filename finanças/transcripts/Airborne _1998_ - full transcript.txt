[chimes] [music playing] ROBERT SHAW: February1990, the Gulf War erupts. And for the first time,American intelligence agencies are without covert operatives in the theater of war. Subsequently the National Security Agency create an elite team known only as Mach 1. Recruited from various special forces, Mach 1 live in the darkestand most dangerous corners of intelligence operations. Shrouded in total secrecy,they infiltrate hot spots, execute their mission anddisappear until the next time. [rain and thunder] [sinister music] ASSASSIN 1: There's no movement in here. DAVE TOOMBS: Nitrophenol is still active. Keep your breathing apparatus on. ASSASSIN 1: Copy that. COMPUTER VOICE: Initiatingcontainment procedure. Procedure complete. Commencing serum diagnostic. [music playing] ASSASSIN 1: Moving up to the testing labs. COMPUTER VOICE: Infusion process complete. Analyzing. ASSASSIN 1: Standby for update. [music playing] COMPUTER VOICE: Activate SS5 procedure. Verifying toxic virus containment. [music playing] ASSASSIN 1: All subjects are down. DAVE TOOMBS: Roger. Copy that. COMPUTER VOICE: Initiateanti-virus pressurization. Alarms are still hot. Watch the doors. ASSASSIN 1: Roger that. [intense music] COMPUTER VOICE: Biogeneticand complete data inputting. ASSASSIN 2: It's been 15 minutes. We're moving out. ASSASSIN 1: They're toast. Let's go. COMPUTER VOICE: Conducting stage1, antigen exposure procedure. Check spectrum scan on screen. Initiating stage 2. [eerie music] Stage three. - Ready. COMPUTER VOICE: Increase coretemperature to 0.7 degrees. [suspenseful music] Ready for atmosphericexpulsion of virus sample. [intense music] [lightning and thunder] [music playing] Stage 2 ready. Releasing one micron. [suspenseful music] Sample is active. Binary reaction between virusand oxygen to form aerosol. Virus is primary color butchanging, becoming invisible. Virus is in controlled environment, 3 millions parts per billion. That's a new record. [very intense music] COMPUTER VOICE: Now initiating shut down. Shut down complete. Face, we got a problem. Repeat. ASSASSIN 1: We've gotcontact with a live subject. Subject is in protective gear and conducting experiments on whatappears to be our target. Retrieve target and terminate subject. Let's go. This is a secure area. [alarm] Security. ASSASSIN 2: This won't hurt a bit. Oh, ah. [alarm ringing] Target secure. Coming out. [lightning and thunder] [intense music] The experiment wasn'tsupposed to be happening. That was your responsibility. My responsibility was to acquire the lab worker's schedule,not to read their minds. You shouldn't have been in there. You messed up. I'll find out how badly. [heavy rain] [lightning and thunder] [phone rings] [police siren] [phone rings] Simpson. BOB MURDOCH [ON PHONE]: This is Murdoch. Assemble Mach 1. There's a fire burning. [powerful mission music] [high pitched laser noise] [powerful mission music] OK. Listen up. Here's what we've got. Security at Forest Dennison, oneof the best genetic engineering groups around, was compromised. A canister of US Armyissued nitrophenol nerve gas was hooked to the e-vac system killing eight people on the night detail. What were they after? It's lot 64921, very nasty stuff. The development of biological weapons hasn't been widely pursued,mainly because they're too unpredictable. An agent has to be highlytoxic yet not too difficult to handle and transport. It also has to be able to standup to atmospheric conditions like rain. Most bacterial agents are ineffective as well. Because antidotes are readily available. But if you could hide a virus-- How do you hide a virus? RON SIMPSON: A virus is species specific. That means it can't jump species. It either infects a bacteria,a plant, an animal, or a human. Now what was stolen from thelab is deadly if untreated. But there is an antidote to it? Yes, but-- It can jump species. Interchangeable betweenbacteria and human, that's what the lab was working on. What's the differenceif you've got an antidote? You hide the virus in anyone of a million bacteria. The enemy locates it andtries to treat the bacteria. Exactly. The enemy is looking for aneedle in a wrong haystack. They focus on the bacteria never thinking a viral agent could be inside. Their dying. And all the while, theantidote is sitting on a shelf somewhere. BACKGROUND INTERCOM ANNOUNCEMENTS Why would someonedevelop this sort of thing? The reason it was developedisn't really our concern. Our focus is to get it back. Should we be wearing protective gear? If the virus is contained, it's safe. If it gets out-- What will it do? RON SIMPSON: Primary exposure results in massive cellular destruction. The body shuts down. The central nervous systemstarts to feed on itself. Secondary exposure is even nastier. What about direct contact? Don't ask. A satellite is tracking the plane we know the viral agent is on. Your team will attempt amidair entry of that plane and retrieve the target. This is what you're looking for. It has to come back to us intact. All right. We've all got our dance cards. RON SIMPSON: We're jammingtheir radar signal. They won't know they've got company. We'll match speed and fire acable with an electromagnet. Like sliding down the bat pole. RON SIMPSON: We have to get next to the wing. We'll try and get as closeto the door as possible. [powerful mission music] Cortez, conventional weapons only. I'd prefer it if I neversaw that thing again. [music playing] [powerful mission music] Fifty miles up, 50 miles down. Faster than Federal Express, huh? BACKGROUND INTERCOM ANNOUNCEMENTS Shall we? [music playing] Engage. CAPTAIN: Roger. [powerful mission music] [funky music] [theme music] I've just about had enough. I've been down for a long time. I've been to hell and back. This is serious business. Here I come, baby, ready or not. Here I come, baby, ready or not. I play the game cause I like it a lot. Here I come, baby, ready or not. [jet engine fires] [alarm beeps] Heading 027. We're above the target. [suspenseful music] Engage cable. [electronic sounds] [music playing] We're connected. Let's go. [intense horn music] All right. We all know the drill. I create the entry and exit point. Concussion grenade. Keep'em quiet. Then we enter. Gemmel, you take thatcockpit and keep us level. Cortez and I'll retrieve the virus. This should go without a hitch. [eerie horn music] McNeil. For luck. [music playing] [powerful mission music] ROMEO CORTEZ: Activating magnets. [intense music] RON SIMPSON: Locate the door Titan One. Roger that. Moving. Are you reading this? Roger Titan One. I can see it. BILL MCNEIL: It's pretty hairy down here. I got trouble moving through this stuff. Give me a moment. RON SIMPSON: We don't have much.Hurry. BILL MCNEIL: Roger that. Activating concussion grenadesone through four on my mark. Three, two, one. We're hot. Ready to detach. I'm starting to sway. RON SIMPSON: Roger that. BILL MCNEIL: Pack and secure. Titan Two and Titan Three, go. [music playing] Titan Two and Titan Three, engage. Titan Two and TitanThree are descending now. ROMEO CORTEZ: Whoa. BILL MCNEIL: Come on. ROMEO CORTEZ: Seems like anice night for a wing walk. RON SIMPSON: Cut the chatter, Titan Three. Titan One status of your package. SARA GEMMEL: What's the holdup, McNeil? Stand by. Come on. Get out of the way. ROMEO CORTEZ: Hard to moveyou around when you're all trussed up in Kevlar, huh? SHIP CHATTER AND ENGINES NOISES RON SIMPSON: Get us in Titan One. Stand by. Roger. Fix the package and blow the house down. [music playing] There's a subject at the blast point. Detonate Titan One. BILL MCNEIL: Negatory. If I blow it now they're as good as dead. Titan One, blow that door now. What if they're holding the target? It'll be in the cockpit. Blow that door. This is an order Titan One. BILL MCNEIL: It's your party. Team, stand by to deliver the package. [explosion] We're in. We're cutting loose. You're on your own. [music playing] BILL MCNEIL: Let's go. Let's move it. ROMEO CORTEZ: Right. [music playing] [lightning and thunder] [music playing] COMPUTER VOICE: Pull up. Don't think. Too low. [lightning and thunder] Faster team. You're running out of time. I want you out of there in one minute. BILL MCNEIL: Titan Two, bring this bird level. Trying. I may lose one trying to bring her under control. [music playing] ROMEO CORTEZ: We found the grail. [music playing] Secure the package and exit. BILL MCNEIL: Go. Let's go now. [beeping sound] SARA GEMMEL: I'm trying toreroute the auto pilot in here. When we pop the top on this package, we knocked out all the avionics. BILL MCNEIL: OK. Do what you can. SARA GEMMEL: Shit. It's not working. The automatic pilot is badly damaged. We got major electrical problems in here. [intense music] It's not responding. Controls are burned out. RON SIMPSON: Leave the cockpit now, Titan Two. You're out of there. That's an order. Copy? SARA GEMMEL: Copy that. [intense music] Oh. BILL MCNEIL: You OK? Things are good to go. BILL MCNEIL: OK. let's hustle. [intense music] [lightning and thunder] SARA GEMMEL: This plane is going down. We've got about a minute. BILL MCNEIL: I'm almost done. [intense music] Shit. I'm losing it. Someone help. SARA GEMMEL: I'm on it. ROMEO CORTEZ: Wait, the virus. Titan One. Stop that cylinder. BILL MCNEIL: Get BOB MURDOCH: It. Get it.ROMEO CORTEZ: Hold on, man. BILL MCNEIL: Forget about me. Get that cylinder. ROMEO CORTEZ: The hell with that. BILL MCNEIL: That's an order.ROMEO CORTEZ: I got it. I got it. I got it. No. SARA GEMMEL: It's mine. Mine. BILL MCNEIL: Jesus Christ. It's safe. Everything's OK. Cylinder contained. OK team, let's pack out. ROMEO CORTEZ: OK. BILL MCNEIL: It's yours. Passing off. [spooky chime] What the hell was that? Goddamned storm. Shit. Titan One, you've got company. Titan One. Team watch your back. I don't know if I can maintain transmission. That is mine. What the hell? ROMEO CORTEZ: He shouldn't be up yet. BILL MCNEIL: We got problems. PILOT: The virus, now. [suspenseful music] Take the parachutes offand toss them out the door. [lightning and thunder] You, hurry up. ROMEO CORTEZ: Got a plan? BILL MCNEIL: Yeah, short and sweet. It better be. BILL MCNEIL: Hey, asshole. You're outta here. What the-- [lightning and thunder] BILL MCNEIL: Oh. SARA GEMMEL: Are you OK? BILL MCNEIL: Ah. oh, I'm fine. I've got Kevlar. [fighting sounds] [intense music] SARA GEMMEL: Get out of the way. PILOT: I'm going to blow your head off. Agh. SARA GEMMEL: We're going down. This bird is DOA. [plane engine] BILL MCNEIL: Gemmel. Get it. SARA GEMMEL: Got it. ASSASSIN: Agh. [intense music] Oo, oh, ah. That was close. Real close. Move out. McNeil, no. [rapid gunfire] Who the fuck is he? A friend of Yours Yeah, right. We're outta here. SARA GEMMEL: I don't have a chute. You do now. On three. One, two, three. [intense music] [explosion] [horn music] [fast tape rewind sound] PILOT: McNeil, no. [fast tape rewind sound] McNeil, no. [fast tape rewind sound] McNeil, no. [rapid gunfire] BOB MURDOCH: It would certainlyhelp this investigation enormously if you could suggest, McNeil, how this man knew your name. I have no idea how he knew my name. BOB MURDOCH: Did you recognize his face? Did you recognize hisface from any other time? My life depends on being able to place a face. I'd never laid eyes on that guy. Well, he certainly knew you, didn't he? There's nothing from the crash site? BOB MURDOCH: The plane dropped like a stone, exploded on impact. The video images we tookfrom the helmet relays are being enhanced now. OK. I have your reports, yes? Ron can contact me if something comes up. Mr. McNeil, there wassome confusion over blowing the entry point in the plane? Yeah. I wanted to make sure allthe subjects were clear. Why? I thought one of the subjects might have been carrying the virus. Why would you think That It's what I thought. One possible interpretationof your actions could be concern for those inside the plane. ROMEO CORTEZ: We're just trying to ah keep up with the times, sir. You know, a kinder,gentler special ops squad. OK. It's a pity Gandhi's gone. He might be a nice addition to your team. No, he'd a failed the eye test. Cortez. What? BOB MURDOCH: That's enough. You may go. Ahem. [music playing] Ron, I'd like a word with you, if I may. He's a bit of wild card, isn't he? McNeil? Yeah. Sometimes. Do you trust him? Yes. [music playing] There are a Limited number ofpeople that knew what was going on in that lab and a limited number of people that cold bring off the operation. We happen to fit into both categories. This is absurd. We got the fucking stuff back. They need to know who set this up. You're sure you've never seenthat guy on the plane before? Positive. No idea how he might know your name? If I didn't shoot him, he could have told me. Man, what are they thinking, huh? Look, I have to deal with Murdoch. Can we meet tonight? Rooney's, 8 o'clock? Rooney's it is. BILL MCNEIL: Oh. [music playing] I'm sure I'd never seen him before. Where would I know him from? You're being paranoid. The guy must known you from somewhere. The 82nd, special ops, somewhere. SARA GEMMEL: ROMEO CORTEZ: High school, kindergarten. Romeo's right. You're being paranoid. Paranoid is a good thingto be in our business. Here, here, even paranoics have enemies. They just have to recognize them. 19 missions without a hitch. 19 ops without casualties,it just doesn't make sense. ROMEO CORTEZ: Hey, you knowwhat this reminds me of? NCAA AA college basketball. The longest winning streak in history belongs to UCLA, 1971 to 1977, without a loss. Now, an Armagnac to theperson who can tell me who snapped the winning streak. Some refer to that as the greatest underdog victory in hoop history. The UCLA Bruins on an '88 game-- Let's get out of here. SARA GEMMEL: Winning streak take the We need to talk. SARA GEMMEL: Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. The Irish squeak by a 71, 70victory at the final buzzer. Cortez, Gemmel, we're done. Want to know who sunk the final basket? Everybody stay online. Murdoch will call as soon asthe video transfer is done. POOL BALLS CLICKING AND CUES BANGING Hey Gemmel, who sunk that final basket? [music playing] [pool balls clicking] Look it up. Oh, man. Why, thank you. Look, we both know the next couple of days are going to be a bitch. So let's just keep our heads low. Mm-hm. Murdoch's going to be all over us on this one. Don't bait the guy. Don't provoke him. If you do, Cortez follows suit. Right. Forget about it. I can't run. It's just-- Let it go. It'll come. I think you know whoeverlifted this virus already has a buyer set up, correct? Go on. BILL MCNEIL: There's onlya dozen guys in the world who could unload this. There's Hans Speckert, Germany. There's Gotsi, SouthAfrica, and Melo, France. Look, Murdoch's on top of all that. Let's just leave it to him. I don't like Murdoch, Ron. He's on our side. If you say so. [music playing] Having problems? Here ah let me take a look. Oh. Oh, here's the trouble. This plug's loose. That'll fix it, no problem. [intense music blast] [silencer gunfire] [tires squealing] RON SIMPSON: How about some music, McNeil. DAVE TOOMBS [ON CD]: Good evening Mr. Simpson or should I say goodbye? What the fuck? [door lock clicks] [intense music] We've got problems, Bill. I've got no control. Running out of road in about a mile. DAVE TOOMBS [ON CD]: You'llfind it quite impossible to get out of your car Simpson. It is agency standard after all. Bullet-proof windows, lead-linedpanels, and me at the controls. RON SIMPSON: That CD. Digital Interface. So is the car's computer system. [tires squealing] [intense music] DAVE TOOMBS [ON CD]: It'sa shame I have to kill you, Simpson. I have a grudging respectfor you and the Mach 1 team. Too bad you're all going to die. BILL MCNEIL: Almost there. If it's digitally controlledwe only have to be interrupt it for about a second. BILL MCNEIL: I'll pop thedoors and then we jump. Fine, fine, just get us out. DAVE TOOMBS [ON CD]: Havea nice afterlife Simpson. [intense music] BILL MCNEIL: Shit. Sorry. [semi truck horn honking] RON SIMPSON: Thanks. TIRES SQUEALING AND HORNS HONKING [intense music] BILL MCNEIL: Working. Working. RON SIMPSON: There's no time left. Jesus, we're heading towards the water. Go, go, go, now. [intense music] [explosion] McNeil? Ah, ah, ah. Some fucking CD. [sirens] Very nice hit. Very creative. You got your phone? [sirens] Call the team. Right. [music playing] [phone rings] Hello?DAVE TOOMBS [ON PHONE]: Hi. I'm calling on behalf of Mars Marketing. Would you like to-- End this conversation? Yes, thank you. [music playing] [suspenseful music] We need a car. No answer. What do you want to drive? Foreign or domestic? [music playing] [phone rings] RON SIMPSON: Hang on. Simpson. What? When? Get a team over to her place now. We're en route. Cortez is dead. How? Looks like a car robbery. Gemmel. [intense music] [phone rings] Oh, man. I hate these phone jerks. [phone rings] Gemmel pick up the phone. [phone rings] - Yes? - Gemmel. SARA GEMMEL [ON PHONE]: McNeil? - Are you all right? - Fine. What's up? BILL MCNEIL [ON PHONE]: Someone tried to kill Simpson and I tonight. There's a team on the way to your house. We're on our way as well. I want you to sit tight and load up. Someone wants us badly . SARA GEMMEL [ON PHONE]: Gemmel? Gemmel? Holy shit. Gemmel. [intense music] [explosion] Gemmel. Get over there. [music playing] [phone rings] Samuels. It's Simpson's car. There's no sign of him. On my way. [music playing] RON SIMPSON: You in charge here? Yeah, I am. Can I have a word please? What happened? Oh, I guess I lost my damage deposit. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm OK. We gotta focus now. We've got some problems. Romeo is dead. How? Murdoch. He says it was a car robbery. Oh, that's bullshit. Let's get out of here. Mr. Simpson? RON SIMPSON: I called for a team. Where are they? I believe they're upstairsin Ms. Gemmel's apartment, at least what's left of it. So much for evidence. [sirens] Mr. Murdoch wants to see. Well, I don't want to see him. Well, let me rephrase this for you. He really wants to see you. This isn't a request. Shall we? McNeil, Gemmel. [computer sounds] [music playing] Hey. Hey. Oh, you're staying all night, aren't you? Yeah, gotta. Look, ah I'll catch you later. Yeah? OK, I'll be at the Living End. Yeah, see you there around 7-ish? [music playing] Wait, wait, I need youfor a couple more minutes. [music playing] [tires squealing] COMPUTER VOICE: NSE access code granted. Retrieving files one through 27. COMPUTER VOICE: Deleting files one through 27. [intense music] [horn music] We're being targeted. I say eliminates us. Let's see now, we had abotched attempt on Simpson. We had a botched attempt on Gemmel and a very, very successfulattempt on the late Mr. Cortez. And the only thing that really bothers me about this whole picture is you, McNeil. We checked in your apartment. My people tell me it's spic and span. It's clean. No one's been there except you. If you think that I'm behind this. It's time to say it. Come on, this is bullshit. He's clearly being set up. Grasping at straws, team? I want some answers. How much would this viruscommand on the open market? International arms market? Ballpark, half a billion. But only if you can find the right buyer. Attempts to kill us make no sense. We have video evidence. We don't. Excuse me? MR. SAMUELS: 57 minutes ago,someone hacked into the imaging system at the lab. The footage was compromised. So, This puzzle continues to fester. You were all a big part of this puzzle. And until we figure it out, I suggest that you will remain here. Your people can't keep track of a video. This ever happen before? Has it? BILL MCNEIL: So what? We're supposed to play bridge until you find out who's behind this? No. You're going to help. And ah we're going to getyou photos, and then photos, and photos until you have discovered that that is the face of the man that you don't recognize from the plane. And then it's just six degreesof separation from there until we find the real manwho is behind all this. And if that man is you? Then we wouldn't be havingthis conversation right now. RON SIMPSON: McNeil. We've got a real problem here. May we have a moment? BOB MURDOCH: Yes. Stressful business we're in, isn't it? [music playing] RON SIMPSON: McNeil. Are you out of your mind? I begged you not to do this. Ron, we are being set up. For Christ sake, this is what we do to people. We put them in packages,tie little bows around them and send them who knows where. And now it's being done to us. No. No one here has any reason to do that. There's half a billion reasons. He wants us to stay here. Why don't we just pitchat tent in the parking lot and paint a bullseye on it? Ron, if we stay here, we're here forever. We're not staying. I'll see what I can do. [soft piano music] MIXED VOICES TALKING ABOUT HALF A BILLION [lightning and thunder] BOB MURDOCH: What about you, Ms. Gemmel? What about me, sir? Staying here, no problem? I understand yourapartment is in shambles. Well, I have a cat that I should really get back and feed. A kitty. He, she, it. His name's Killer. RON SIMPSON: Gemmel. Could you wait outside? Ah, no problem. We need an option. [music playing] Gemmel, McNeil. Thank you. All right, he's got us a safe house and a car. It's either there or here. I say we go for it. What about weapons? Standard issue in the car. This is it? And all the toys. That would help. Where we going, Ron? RON SIMPSON: Police crime scene. Hide in plain sight. [low chime] Oh, I can't believe that Cortez is dead. Oh. I never should have left him. SARA GEMMEL: And then Simpsonwould be dead and maybe me. Don't blame yourself, McNeil. The guy on the plane. How did he know my name? I'm going to bed. [crickets chirping] [eerie music] [intense music] [door closing] [eerie music] One, two, three. [intense music] [gun shots] [intense music] [gun shots] Some safe house. [music playing] Hey. [music playing] [horn music] Ron, I know you love to keep the faith. But Murdoch is no longer in my good book. Yeah. OK. What do we know? Let's just take Murdoch down. There are only three of us left. That's all he has to deal with. We have no idea how many peopleare involved in this operation. Well, what about Murdoch's superior? Murdoch's superior, whoever heis, could be involved in this. Half a billion dollars buys you a pretty army. Suppose we could go to the FBI or the papers. And be a witness who doesn't make it through protective custody. I pass on that. Wait a minute, half abillion dollars, that's it. What's it? This guy has two choices. He can either kill us andput the entire plan to bed. Or you can reactivate it with us in on it. What do you mean? Get it back and offer it to him at a price. And then take him down. We've retrieved it once. We could do it again. This is so far-fetched. We're deep enough in the shit as it is. Ron, I know you love the rules. There are no more. Can you find out where the virus is? Probably. [soft horn music] [computer beep] RON SIMPSON: It's in storagein a disposable facility, viruses, toxins, and bacteria. Liquid nitrogen is used tofreeze this stuff forever. Looks pretty secure. It is. They do a lot of work for the military. I can get you in. I can find out when the virusis to be destroyed and get you in at the same time. How do you get us in? Well, it's a little moredifficult than it seems. Five entrances all videomonitored and security guard but I've got one angle. [suspenseful music] [computer beeps] Video cameras one through fiveare replaying of jammed signal. They're not going to see you go in. I wasn't happy when Cortez used that. I'm even less impressed that you're using it. But you're not going in there. For luck. We're gonna need it. [intense music] You've got 12 minutes. After that destruction of the target begins. [intense music] SARA GEMMEL: I've got on night vision. [computer noises] [powerful mission music] [security guards talking] [powerful mission music] Once past the entrance,you'll see the main building. It's just over 100 yards away. [intense music] Zeus, we're in position for primary target. RON SIMPSON: You have 10minutes Enter the facility and don't waste any time. [computer buzzer] Clear. [intense music] [eerie string music] You have eight minutes. SARA GEMMEL: Five degreesnorth, northeast, 30 meters and counting 29, 28, 27. RON SIMPSON: What you're looking for, team, is a large liquid nitrogen cistern. The product is scheduled for deep freeze storage putting it in stasis forever. BILL MCNEIL: How are we going to get it out? RON SIMPSON: Don't worry. It's not frozen yet. SARA GEMMEL: We're here. Zeus, we found the grail. Roger that. Standing by. BILL MCNEIL: I'm telling younow, it's a long way down. RON SIMPSON: Hustle. [eerie intense music] You have seven minutes. BILL MCNEIL: Copy that. We're descending now. It's gonna be close. [suspenseful music] [sparks and crackling] [suspenseful music] We're half way home. Six minutes. [intense music] [loud squeaking door opens] BILL MCNEIL: We're inside. SARA GEMMEL: Ah, helooks strangely familiar. BILL MCNEIL: OK. Let's close it up. DAVE TOOMBS: Don't bother. I'll take that. My associate has a gun on you. To be a good little agent andpass up the virus, will you? Easy. Easy does it now. So, this is the Mach 1 team. And I thought you were so big and bad. You two went down as easy as your friend. [intense music] Who are you? How the hell did you get in here? Magic. Zeus, we got company. I'm blocking all frequencies, Mr. McNeil. You think I'd be that stupid? COMPUTER VOICE: Warning. Liquid nitrogen now being shunted. Please move away from the unit. Close all system doors to avoid exposure. [gunfire] A bullet to the head or a cold bath you two? COMPUTER VOICE: Liquidnitrogen now being distributed. Avoid contact with cistern. Close all outer doors to avoid contamination. This should be interesting. I failed science in school. But I'm willing to bet we'reabout to see two human icicles. [intense music] [loud pop] Ah, ah, gas crack. Ah, no. Agh. Ah, oh, oh, oo. Oh, oo. [computer alarm system] SARA GEMMEL: Let's get out of this freezer. [powerful mission music] BILL MCNEIL: Zeus, this is Titan One. Zeus, do you copy? We got trouble. What? [intense music] BILL MCNEIL: We got a bogie. He's holding the virus. And he's moving away. Who the fuck? BILL MCNEIL: He didn't give a name. Just get him. Get him. He's coming at you. I'm on it. [intense music] [rapid gunfire] BILL MCNEIL: No. [rapid gunfire] Ron. [soft music] [engine starts] SARA GEMMEL: The virus. [music playing] BILL MCNEIL: Pow. [music playing] Let's go get a car. [intense music] Put the jacket on McNeil. We've got to hide. We've got to find somewhere. We've got to get off the street. Oh, jeez. There. Good. [traffic noises] Check the news. See if there's anything onabout what just happened. The two are sought in the theft of an experimental defoliantfrom the Department of Agriculture. If released into theatmosphere, this defoliant could have catastrophic results. [news reporters talking on tv] Not a bad cover to flush us out. Do you think the people at the desk saw this? I think we're secure. Oh. OK. I'm going to run a bath. [phone rings] Yeah? BOB MURDOCK [ON PHONE]: McNeil, look outside. What is it? [intense music] SARA GEMMEL: We're toast. Agent Gemmel, Agent McNeil, just put your weapons down please. BOB MURDOCK: All right everyone,just remain cool, remain calm. There is no need for violence. Gemmel, McNeil, it's beena busy evening I see. We're leaving here alone. Where you gonna go? There's been a new development. I have some new information I'mdying to share with you two. So why don't you just put down your weapons. Put the guns down. We don't trust you, Murdoch. Well, what choice do you have? I-- I'm holding all the cards now. You either spend 40 years at Leavenworth or you come back to the fold. What'll it be? How about I blow your head clean off? [music playing] Can I finish my cigar first? I'd say we're fucked. AGENTS TALKING IN BACKGROUND ON RADIOS OK, here's what we got. We're tracking every kind oftransactional communication possible, credit card, long-distance, domestic, and international. Problem, half the calls out of Washington international long distance. And what exactly are we looking for? Well, um that man youturned into a popsicle today. His name was Leonard Jackson. And this is? That's the guy we saw. BOB MURDOCK: His name is David Toombs. The description was perfect. He works for a man called Pierre Melo. Now, arms sales is a very shadowy business. As we know, Melo is so obscure, we don't even know what he looks like. And you think he's behind all this? Yes, yes I do. We believe Melo's in America right now. OK. How do we find him? MR. SAMUELS: Interpol has given us a voice print on Dave Toombs. We've established a phone sweepof the greater Washington area. As soon as Toombs contactsMelo, we'll have a location.
