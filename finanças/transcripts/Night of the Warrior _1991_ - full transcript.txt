That's my boy. Good show tonight, Miles. Jolly good show. To me he looked a little slow. Last fight, Lynch, all debts are paid. No more, I am through fighting for you. Whatever you say, Miles. Take care of that eye. Boss.Hey, Bike. You look like white trash. Where's Edie? In her chambers. Listen don't forget to walk the girls out tonight. You bet.I'll lock up. Another fight? I thought you gave that shit up. Yeah, well, you know how it is. Do I know how it is? I bet you do, Joy. You know something? I quit tonight. I am not gonna fight anymore. How about you? Can you quit? Sure. That feel good? Come on. Let's have some fun like we used to. I asked you a question. You're so hot for fun, you don't know how to have fun anymore. Maybe you never did. Miles, there you are, I've been waiting up for you. I am here as always. You look beautiful, Edie. Really?Yeah. You think so? I haven't worn this since oh, it's over 20 years. Last time I wore it, it was on Broadway. When I danced with Tony Martin. We made the last mortgage payment, this place is finally ours. We don't have to pay Lynch another cent. Listen to what they're playing. Do you remember this? I've got to go lock up, Edie. Please, just once, for old time's sake. Please. Just once, one dance. I love you, Ma. Here you go. Nice and well done. Shh. The a la mode's on me. So Katherine you haven't answered, what about tomorrow? Well there's an art opening. Great we'll do both. Look honey it's a faculty thing. Which means I'll get stuck talking to Kylie's wife all night long. It's only one night. I've heard that before. I mean it is always... Do you mind?Did he just take a picture of you? Yes. If he does it again, I'll throw him out on his ear. Listen I know you're tired but if you want to come by later. Will it improve my grade? Maybe. I'll pick you up tomorrow at 7:00, all right?All right. Coco, I am still waiting on those burgers. House rules, you don't eat, you can't stare. Just give me the special. That's kasha-stuffed green peppers. You man enough? Try me. One Volga Boat Ride. Anything to drink?Coffee, black. What's a girl like you doing with a trip like that? I won him in the lottery. Life's short, hope he pays your rent. That information is classified. Isn't Drew up past his bedtime? Don't get me started Coco. Just keeping an eye on you. Well you should keep an eye on the toaster. Oh, my god. Keep it, it's been real. Hey, about that picture you took. I see my face on some porno bod and I am sending my kamikaze hit man after you. I'll be waiting. You own a valuable commodity, Mr. Lynch. Own may not be the correct word, Mr. Chang. My associates and I were very impressed with last night's event. We look forward to the next one. My boy's unavailable, he retired. Maybe a substantial down payment will change that. I think we can work something out. Good. Coffee?Please. What's in the package? I brought these for you to look at. Decide which ones you want me to blow up for you. They're video prints. It's a new thing. God these are really beautiful. So are you. Who are these people?Just people. You don't know them.I get to know them. I try to get inside of them. You know there's this wing at the Contemporary that shows photo art. I work there part-time you should check it out. How about tonight?It's not open at night. I meant dinner. I am busy tonight. You got a lot of nerve, give a guy an inch. If you change your mind, this is where I work. Thanks for the coffee. What about these?Keep them. Good evening, Miss Edie. Who are we tonight? Gloria Swanson? I'll be at my table. Would you be kind enough to ask Miles to visit? Guess who? Oh Joy. You've been missed.Oliver. You'll get me fired. Fired up, baby. Sweet candy for the sweet, sweet girl. I love you. You know, I love what money can do. I truly do. Look around, here. I make you a loan. And this club, every time I come here you make new improvements. I am sure you came all the way out here to tell me that. No. I wanted to talk to you, Miles. About another fight. I am not interested.Miles, wait. Miles. Look, you see this? This is money, Miles, big money. It's not a loan. It's yours. I don't want it. No, Miles, no wait, wait. Miles, you can't do this, you see. I have already booked the fight. You see I cannot... I cannot go back on these people, who covet honor. Then I would say you have a problem, Lynch. Because I don't fucking want it. Miles...I've given you enough blood. So take your dirty money and get out of my club. I am the one for you, not Miles. Just me, you belong to me. You don't own me. Excuse me, can you sit down, man? I can't see the dance. See this. Come on, come on. Let him go. This is not your concern! You know something. You're not that fucking good. Joy, Joy. Leave, Joy. This is for you, baby. Oliver! Oliver, have we forgotten our manners? Another time, Miles, another time. You see, Miles, brute force must be channeled. You have so much to learn, my boy. Ciao. Okay, everyone. Everything's okay, sit down, have a drink on the house. Shit. Katherine! Katherine, wait a minute. Shit. Mario, he ain't so tough for a fighter at this point, huh? Louie, file this piece of shit. He ain't dead yet?No. Let's get him out of here. I was very unhappy with the way things went earlier this evening. Embarrassing Oliver. Turning down my offer. I thought we had something, Miles. I hope you weren't just leading me on. Call me. We can work this out. Hi. What happened to you? Little accident, nothing serious. You here for my breakfast special? Or are you looking for my little girl? Is she around?No. Thanks. Aren't you going to ask me where she is? The backyard's a little small but there's room enough for a Jacuzzi. Sounds like it's exactly what you've been looking for. I think you should buy it.Really? You think so? Why not? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, why not, yeah. Listen you are going to love it. We can convert the second bedroom into a den and turn the garage into a studio for you. Whoa. What do you mean, "we"? I like living here. What with your uncle? I grew up on a farm Drew I am sick of living out of town. I want to live in town. I want to live in town. What I do know is that I don't want to play house in some faraway split level. Not with you, not with anybody else. Look, if you're confused... I am not confused. I see so I get to be second runner up to some self-absorbed artistic fantasy. You better go. Fine. Drew. I don't want any hard feelings. What the hell are you doing here? Now it makes sense. Excellent taste Katherine. Excellent. Enjoy the ride while it lasts, pal. Thanks. Can I come in? Why not, I'm on a roll. Cool house. What are you doing here? Your uncle told me where you lived. He did? You know anyone who breaks thumbs for cheap? I am sure you do. I think your uncle likes me. You haven't answered my question. What are doing here?Well... You took off so fast last night I didn't have a chance to explain what happened. So... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to invite you to lunch. Well, that's lovely. I am sorry, I have a 3:00 class. We'll be back by then. I don't think so. See you. Wait... Your chariot awaits. Lunch is fine, but I am not exactly dressed for this. Yeah you are, come on hop on. Remember to keep the feet on the pegs. Hold on tight. So, you're an artist? Well actually I am learning a little bit of everything. Drawing, painting, sculpture. My main focus is art history. Someday soon. I may move to Europe. I am not going to be one of those ugly American tourists, though. Does that sound silly?No I have been doing all the talking, tell me something about you. Do you want to dance? You're changing the subject. Come on, let's dance I am a terrific dancer. I am a terrible dancer. Come on. You inspired him. That's Eduardo. This is where you live?Mmm-hmm. Watch your step, I'll get the lights. I know the name of this really great housekeeper she maybe could help you out a little bit. Did you take all these pictures? Yep, you want a drink? Red wine?I have beer, how's that? That's fine. So, how did you get into photography? When I was a kid I got a camera for my birthday one year. And I just started taking pictures. Next thing you know I was hooked. What's that? I'll show you. It's a video projector with a zoom lens. These people all live around here. They inspire me in a funny way. The images are just a result. It's the process that counts. Finding that moment of truth in someone. That part of life in a person. The part you recognize? Yeah. Are those the girls you work with? The one's at your club? Some of them. Do you make love to them? Sometimes. Does it excite you? Taking their picture. Sometimes. Take my picture. I want to know what's it like. So what do you want me to do? It doesn't work like that. Then I'll do whatever I want. Where did you learn that? I've been doing it as long as I can remember. My old man got me started. He knew karate? No, he was a boxer. I learned karate to piss him off. Is he still alive? We gotta get you home. Sorry to break the flow. Yes? I was sure you'd want to see this. What is it? Miles. Louie. Hit it. "There the antic sits, "scoffing at his state and grinning" "at his," pompous son of a bitch. You know how it is Mr. Chang, these things happen. Of course. And you understand that I did the best I could. I know. Well, I appreciate your courtesy in this matter. Goodbye. Yes. Goodbye. Asshole. Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Keep coming. Mr. Chang always keeps his commitments. He expects you to do the same. Is that understood? Get the fuck away from me! Oh, God, my face. Get me a doctor! My face. All right, all right. This is Miles. Miles has done this. And his fucking little games. Oliver... I think it's about now we enter the big time. In our next room we have a piece that was donated to the museum by one of our trustees Mr. Brickman. The work integrates heat and light through the use of temperature sensitive tubes. In here we have our popular photo art display. The first artist is a New York photographer Thomas Wright. His work is very documentary, very... Unrealistic. Well we seem to have an expert among us. Sorry. Please, go on. If you insist. Look at this picture, this guy probably sleeps outside every night of his life. Freezing his ass off. Does anybody see that in this picture? No. Well, everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion. Shall we move on? What are you doing? Miles, what are you doing? Excuse me ladies and gentlemen while I experience temporary difficulties. Miles, this is an expensive piece.Come here. Miles, I am working.You work too hard. Don't. Don't, Miles, stop. Miles, stop, I have to get back to work. You can't leave me like this.Watch me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, would you care to follow me? You're dropping your left hand, boy. Chance? Hey... Oh, man, don't knock me over. Where have you been man?I knew I'd find you here. Place still smells the same. Hey, where the hell you been? You know, getting my life together. Learnin' how to walk. Yeah. You could have done that here.Nah, it wasn't the place. Hey, man. I never felt right about the way we left... Hey come on, that's old, man. I mean, what's it been? Three years? Come on. We have some catching up to do. If your old man ever found out what you're doing with your life, he'd turn over in his grave. Yeah, we were a hell of a team, Miles. Wherever there was a tournament, there we'd be kicking ass. That's right, man. You and I would have wound up fighting for the title. You creamed me man, you were too good. Still with therapy, huh?I bust my ass six days a week. Come on, I'll show you. What are you talking about? Come on.Come on, let's go a round. Get out of here. Come on. Come on we'll go light. What's your problem man?Let's go. You're gonna bust my arm. Okay, all right. You would think, you'd have learned the first time, man. You okay?Yeah. Come on, Joy. Well, hey, Bike, aren't we going to get our goodnight kiss? I am a married man, I keep telling you girls that. And we're going to keep trying to make you forget.Yeah. Goodnight.Goodnight, sweetie. Bye. Sarah and I are going to grab a bite to eat, you want to join us? No thanks, I'm kinda beat. See you tomorrow. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. Hi, Joy.Oliver. You scared the shit out of me. Sorry, baby. Did you get what I asked for?Yeah. Why do you want this for anyway? Just for the record. Just for the record. I got what you wanted. You savior. I better go.Come on, it's late, why don't you crash here? No, I gotta go. Don't let it be so long next time. Yeah, sure. We all left at the same time. I don't know. What happened? What are you doing here, Frank? One of the dancers was killed in the parking lot last night. It was Joy. She was strangled in her car. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Strangled? Edie. Edie, look at me. Look at me. Where was Bike? These girls aren't supposed to be alone in the parking lot at night, that's understood. I know. Oh, Miles. Miles. Oh, Joy. You and Joy Hammond used to be lovers? Yeah, used to be, so? A few of your employees stated that, you two were on bad terms. That the other night there was a fight. You were violent.It was a misunderstanding that's all it was. Lovers' quarrel? If that's what you want to call it... I don't have to tell you what this is. It's what she was strangled with. You aren't by chance missing a hand wrap, are you, Miles?I don't keep track. Send it to the lab. You got any more questions for me? I've known you since you were shitting in your diapers. If you're in trouble I want to help. Thanks. Look who's here? Oliver. It's a joy watching you work, Miles. Such talent. You set me up. Don't be silly, Miles, I intend to take very good care of you. You need to fight. I only wanted to remind you. In your sick mind, how did you figure that by killing an innocent girl you're gonna get me to fight for you? I am your alibi. I was with someone all night. One may smile and smile and... Be a villain. What are you doing here? We're both doing the same thing, Miles. We're taking care of business. I know about Joy, the problems you two were having. I know about the club, how you've been trying to make ends meet. How much is he paying you? Was that genius, Miles? Finding your old buddy that you crippled rehearsing that karate shit? What do they call that...Sparring. They killed somebody they killed a girl. After all we've been through, is this what it comes down to? I wouldn't mention my name to the police, Miles. You bring me into it, you bring Chang into it and his methods are old world. Frank! Frank! Additional proof of the crime... There are two types of blood on the rag you gave me neither one belonged to the victim. And according to the lab test one of the blood types was O negative. Miles Keane.Shit. Get a search warrant. Keane, it's the police, open up! Keane! Let's go around. Look at this shit. This guy's into the kinky stuff. Saint John Climacus the Abbott of Sinai wrote a treatise at the end of the 6th century for the edification of the monks. Dealing with the heavenly virtues and the seven deadly sins. I need to talk to you. Miles, what are you doing here?Now. This theme... Depicted in this painting as in other paintings of the Byzantine era, by the monks... Last night one of our dancers was killed. If this is an attempt to get me to back off...No, it's not. I know who did it. And they're trying to pin it on me.Excuse me... You wanna share this with the whole class? Miles, what's going on? What're you talking about? A few years ago I took a loan from this guy to buy the club. I paid him back by fighting for him, now he won't let me go. He's trying to force me into another fight. That's insane. Did you go to the police, did you tell them this?They won't believe me. Of course they will you didn't kill anybody. They made it look like I did it, they set the whole thing up so perfectly that I have nothing to back my story with. I don't know what to do. I got people looking all over for you. But I am here, Frank, I called your office, they said you were in court. What are you on trial? Let's go somewhere and talk. It's got your blood on it, Miles. The DNA test was conclusive.I didn't kill her. Was Joy trying to blackmail you?What are you talking about? The club's records for the last three years. Where did you get this?In Joy's dance bag. It doesn't balance out, Miles. Where did you get that kind of money? Want to tell me what's going on? Friday nights down at Pappy's. Your old man was one hell of a fighter. He's a fucking bum who walked out on his family. He was in over his head. Everybody wanted a piece of him, he was just too stupid to ask for help. So what?Don't you do the same thing! There's a woman outside who says she was with Miles that night. Where is she now?She's outside. Bring her in. Somebody's here to see you. Hello, Mr. Chang. This bell was given by the Korean people to the American people. It's a symbol of our friendship for each other. We are friends, are we not, Mr. Lynch? We are, Mr. Chang. And friends would not do anything to harm the other's interests would they? They would not, Mr. Chang. My interests are tied up in tomorrow night's fight. Well, Mr. Chang, my fighter has had some difficulty with the law. I will try to have him cleared by tomorrow night but if that's not possible I am sure you'll understand that it's out of my hands. I mean, if he's in custody, there's nothing I can do. He was cleared this morning, Mr. Lynch. So you and the girl that was killed were lovers? We used to be. Were you close? We went through some shit a long time ago. I am sorry. Well if you fought in so many of these fights, why not this one? Because if I fought in this one, I'd have to fight another one. And another one after that it would never end. I opened the club to get out of this hole. And now it just seems like I'm getting in deeper and deeper. Aren't you afraid of what they might do to you? You know it's like you said at the station, I can't run away from this. I really appreciate what you did today. It took a lot of guts, thank you. Who's there? Miles? Miles, is that you? Hello, Miss Edie. How did you get in here? Terribly sorry to interrupt your performance, Miss Edie. Get out. Get out, both of you, I'll call the police. I don't think so. What do you want? We're looking for Miles, your dear son. Perhaps you'd be kind enough to tell us where he is. I don't know. Then I am afraid we're going to be here a little longer than I thought. I don't want anything happening to you. I'm just starting to like you. I am so sorry for the inconvenience, Miss Edie. Give Miles a message. Tell him to be at this address 10:00 tomorrow night. If you call the cops, Miles will be killed. Oh, hello there. See you. Yeah? Miles, it's Ronnie.Ronnie, what's up? You got to get over here right now, I am at the club. Miles, it's your mother. I'll be right there. Miles, I am really worried about you. Everything's going to be okay. It'll all be over soon. Close your eyes. I am going to go home and get a little nap. I just can't keep the hours I used to. All right, I'll hold down the fort. I won't be long.Okay. Hello. What can I get for you? A very thick, chocolate shake. With whipped cream. And a cherry on top. I'll have the same, hold the cherry. Take it off. You okay? Fine. I'll get it.Got it, thanks. Yeah?LYNCH: Miles, I just heard about your mother. Oliver and I are so sorry. Where are you, you son of a bitch, you piece of fucking garbage. Well I am on my way to this fight. Word on the street is, it's going to be an extraordinary event. You know what Lynch? Chang is going to whip your throat out because you're not bringing your fighter. Oh, I think you will be there. Do you know how I know? Your girlfriend assures me. Say hi.Miles! Miles...That's enough. Katherine! Katherine! Well, Miles, I'd love to sit and chat but you see it's almost show time. Listen to me. Ciao.Lynch! Miles, there's no time to talk. The fight's in half an hour. Be there. Bike.Yeah? Take it.What's that for? I need you to stay here until I get back. All night if you have to.All right. Anybody tries to go up to Edie's room, kill them. Okay, you mind telling me what's going on?I can't tell you. But if I am not back before closing call the police. Talk to Detective Bartolucci. Tell him this is where I am. Okay, good luck. Quarter after.I know what time it is! Was getting a little worried, Miles. I thought maybe you wouldn't show. Where is she, Lynch? Down there, safe and sound. You feel that boy? That's not a hard-on. That's a Magnum, aimed at your balls. Now back the fuck up.Cut the dramatics! Let him see her! Christ. Katherine!Miles! He'll be ready in just a couple of minutes. Everything's going to be all right.It's gonna be okay. I am sorry I got you into this. Let's go, lover boy. So, Chance, you gonna stay for the show? We're even. I hope you're not planning to take a dive, Miles. I bet everything I have on you. You kill him. There'll be enough money to keep you happy for a very long time. You need to win to save the girl. Break a leg. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Miles. Miles.Oh, Katherine. Thank god you're alive. Hey, let her go.Let me go. Bravo, Miles. You had me worried. You got what you wanted, Lynch. You're a fool, my boy. You could have made more money than you ever dreamed possible. Let's take a walk, Miles.We had a deal. Lynch. We had a deal, Lynch.Walk. We had a deal. Where are they taking us?I don't know. It's a surprise. Up the stairs. Lying in bed last night, I came up with this wonderful idea. A Romeo and Julietriff. You are so riddled with guilt because you murdered your ex-girlfriend that you decide to kill yourself. You're crazy, Lynch. Your new girlfriend, the one who lied to protect you, finds you dead and takes her own life as well. You've lost it. What do you think, Miles? Pretty dramatic, no? You'll never get away with it and you know it. There's only one loose end, Miles. Only one other person who knows you're here. That's far enough.Your dear mother. That's why I put her someplace safe where you couldn't find her. You're bluffing. Why don't you let her go, Oliver, you and I will have this out. I'll let her go. I'll let her go about 100 feet. I think you'll find this part fun. Fun, fun, fun, Miles. You ever see a man hang, Miles? Lower yourself down. Louie.Miles. Okay. All right. Under the railing, that's it. Don't do it, Miles, don't do it. Love to stay and watch but have to dash. I have an appointment at the Korean Savings and Loan. To pick up my winnings. All the money I won tonight. All the way. Then I think I should pay your mum a little visit. What do you think, Miles?Fuck you, Lynch. Fuck you. Have fun, Oliver. Lynch. Mario, stay here and watch the door. And meet me back at the club when it's over, we'll have a few drinks to celebrate. You never give up, do you? Fight it. He's getting tired, Louie. Let him up. Well, well, well. The cripple's had a change of heart. Killing him wasn't part of the plan, let him up. There's been a change. Cut the crap, Oliver, let him up. Still got your bitch, Miles. Don't try nothing. Oh. Let go! No! I'll kill you. Miles, give me your hand. Miles, come on baby. Come on you can do it. Come on give me your hand. I'll pull you up. Please come up, you can do it. Give me your hand, give me your hand. Oh no, he's mine. You want to be a hero, Chance? Come to poppa, come on. Fucker. You have been one pain in the ass. Goodbye, Miles. No! It's okay. That's Bartolucci, listen. Tell Bartolucci, I've gone to the Playpen okay? I gotta get Edie out of there. All right? Miles? Where are you? Over here, Lynch. If I find you I have to kill you, Miles. Are you still here? Oh, yeah. Nervous are we? Come hither, you worm. Fooled you. All right. All right, Miles, let's talk. All right.What do you want? Money? I made a great deal of money tonight, Miles. I don't want your money. Bullshit. Money is everything. Everything? Brutus is an ambitious man. Ambition. You fought for it. You earned it. Earned it. You can have it all, Miles. All of it. You hear that, Lynch? They're coming to get you. Game's over.Fuck you. You lose.Fuck you, Miles. That girlfriend alibi is bullshit and you know it. I'll take you with me. You lose, Miles. Drop it, I said drop it. Miles, stay where you are. Watch out, Miles. Katherine, get back.Miles, watch out. Get an ambulance. Miles, hang on. Hang on, baby. At the artist's request, proceeds from this exhibit will be donated to the Hope Shelter for the homeless. This guy's got lot of heart, don't you think?
