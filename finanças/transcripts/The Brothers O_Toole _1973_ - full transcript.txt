[MUSIC PLAYING] -How big a loan did you have in mind, Lubie? -Well, it'd take every bit of $25. -I'm sure you're good for the money, Lubie, but that's a little rich for us. -Well how come you looked so friendly when I first came in? -I thought maybe you were here to make a deposit. It's not you, Lubie. Guess the whole town is having a bad case of the shorts. -Always has had, ain't it? -Lately. Long as I've been here. Nobody's ever had a nickle. Except, of course, the mayor. Shame to. Pretty little town like "Ma-li-la," "Ma-lu-ba-la," "Ma-bui-la." -We did everything we could to pull this town out of the mud. -"Mo-bui-la-li-la." -Now somebody's got to do something to help us. -Well that'd be nice all right. But who? Where? -You people are making a terrible mistake. -Get all. -I mention this without a tinge of personal hostility or reproach, but as man to man in a spirit of kindly helpfulness and constructive objectivity. Because high or low, wherever you go, the world does not like a poor loser. -When they're playing cards for money, they don't like too good a winner either. -Gentleman, there's a time for talk. There's a time for action. This is a time to run. [GUN SHOTS] Not a friend in the world. And that's the only thing I've got to be thankful for. -Don't you have kinfolks anywhere, Timothy? -No. Not at present. At one time though we were a very big family and awful rich. We owned all of New York south of 14th Street. Yeah. I had brothers and sisters to feed to the hogs. -Really? How many? -Well let's see, Alfred was the oldest, brother that is. He was a missionary eaten by the heathen savages of a distant land. -Well, that's terrible. What distant land? -Belgium, I think the name was. -Oh Timothy. How dreadful. -I know. Makes me weak all over just thinking about it. -But I bet you've been to all sorts of interesting places. -Not all. To tell you the truth, I've never been to Wichita. -I'm an only child. -Are you really? So am I. -You're getting awfully strong all of the sudden. -I know. I tell you, uh, uh-- -Bonnie Lou MacClanahan. -There are certain women that affect a fellow that way. It's what they call animal magnetism. -Are you sure you're sincere? I bet you didn't have any dizzy spell at all. I bet it was just a mean old trick to get me up here in your room. -Now you've gone and hurt my feelings. -And that's not the kind of girl that-- Because we're brought up very strict around here, and I don't even go with boys. And if Papa knew that I was up here in a gentleman's-- -Do that again. -Oh, I remember-- [KNOCKING] Now who on earth? -Yes? -I know who's in there with you! -Gee willikers. It's Papa! MR. MACCLANAHAN: (YELLING) Open it up, or I'll break it down! [KNOCKING] -Please, Mr. MacClanahan. [GLASS BREAKING] -Papa, Papa. Whatever you're gonna-- [GUN SHOTS] BONNIE: I swear Papa! [GUN SHOTS] -Is this it? The Golden West? Land of opportunity to stave to death, to be massacred by the yayhoos. Anything west of 8th Avenue is New Jersey! Any civilized community you could-- well, there you are. Man's best and noblest friend, the goat. Been putting it away all this time, have you? I hope it's poison ivy. If it's grass I'll join you. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Don't get lost again, Fred. I'll be right back. [CHICKEN SQUAWKING] TIMOTHY: Well, Michael O'Toole. -It never fails. You get a little ahead in the world and here come all your poor relations. Something the matter? -It could use more salt. -What do you mean, more salt? -OK. It could use salt. -Salt doesn't grow on trees, you know. -I didn't know that. -Neither do chickens. -Look, I was just suggesting that, all things considered, it's not quite as tasty as the chicken Mama used to make. -Where's your horse? -I don't have a horse. -I gave you one three months ago. -I lost it. -You'd lose your head, if it weren't tied on. Shut up, and enjoy your chicken. It's not easy being an orphan in this cruel world, Timothy. -Yeah, I can imagine. -I could make it, if it were just me. But being mother and father both to a wild, irresponsible half grown boy-- -It's not that easy being a half grown boy once you're pushing 30. -I suppose anybody else would have given up by now. -True. -But I promised our sainted mother I'd try to help you make something of yourself. -Hey, it's my turn. -It's not three miles. -Back there was three miles, but you were talking. -Just another example, Timothy, of the advantages of an extensive vocabulary. What's it say? -"M-O-L-Y" How should I know? You're the one who went to high school. What's it look like? -It looks like food. You stay here. Try not to attract undue attention. I'll ride ahead, and reconnoiter, see if the place is worth a clean shirt and a shave. -Just this once, Michael, why couldn't I ride ahead and whatever that word was? -Because if there's a woman around or something like that, you always forget what you're looking for. -That's true. -Harold, we're already running late. -Confoundit, driver. We're nine minutes behind schedule. -If I'm holding you back, why don't you go on ahead without me? -Ambrose. Ambrose Littleberry. What's he doing in town in broad daylight? -My good man. Terribly sorry. Tell me, colonel. -You know what this is. -It's either Halloween or April fools. What are you doing with that thing? -I'm putting you under arrest, Mister. -Careful. That's loaded. -You can come along quietly dead or alive. -For one lousy cigar butt? -Get your hands up, Mister. And don't compound the felony by getting sarcastical. -Felony? It wasn't even lit. -This way. Come on. Come on. Get moving. Move, move, move. Not too fast. Easy does it. -This is a gross miscarriage of justice. You're riding roughshod over the taxpayers! -Just get in there, killer. Try not to make any funny moves. -Fine courtesy from a public servant. -Any desperado comes up against Eli Hatfield, he's hell to pay, and I picked hot. I've got no hesitation, Mister. Shoot 'em down like a rabid dog. -Really? -I'm the high sheriff here, Mister. I ask the questions. Oh my goodness. TIMOTHY: (SINGING) Come home, come home, come home. Father, dear father come home. -Whoa. Whoa. Whoa girl. Whoa. Whoa. [COCKS GUN] -Now you hold it right there, buster. [GUN SHOT] Merciful heavens. What have I done? What have I done? -You about scared me half to death. That's what you done. -It's a big day, Mr. Mayor. -Sure is, mother. -They really got him, huh? -Sure as hell did. -Oh isn't it a thrill your Honor? Aren't you happy? -Harmon, it's a red letter day, a milestone in the history of-- HARMON: No chance of his getting away is there? -No chance of anything for that bird. As the chief executive of this here community, it is my intention-- -Can I see him? It's not too soon. -Well, come along. The better the day, the better the dead. MICHAEL: In the ordinary course of events, I am not a vindictive man. But in your case I'm going to make an exception. I'll have your job for this! -Anybody who wants my job can have my job. It's not much of a job, no how. -This your man, Hatfield? -That's him, your Honor, in the flesh. -Good work. Good work. I'll see that it gets into the record. -Thank you, Sir. Very kind of you. -Thrilling spectacle, Mr. Hatfield. The bravest thing I ever saw. -Oh hell, Mr. Lovejoy. It wasn't nothing at all. Not hardly. -Oh yes it was. Like taking a rattler with your bare hands. Good morning, sir. A very pretty day. -Ugly customer. -The only time I ever saw a face like yours, it took the bait right off my hook. -Civil tongue, feller. You're talking to the mayor. -My name is Harmon P. Lovejoy. I hope we'll get to know each better in quick span-- MAYOR: Shut up. -You listen to me, Farmer John. I've been through these little hay seed towns before. Somebody walks through with shoes on his feet, you pick him up for mopery, and slap a fine on him for the gold in this teeth. Not this time. -Not hardly. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. -Well I'll keep an eye on them anyway. -You have preyed upon the citizens of this community for the last time. -Preyed? I didn't even spit on the sidewalk! -Don't talk vulgar. -The circuit judge will be through here tomorrow. If I were you, I'd get myself a good lawyer just for the sake of appearances. -What do I need a lawyer for? -Various high crimes and misdemeanors against the peace and good order of the sovereign state of Colorado and the beautiful town of "Molly be damn." Did you talk to the relatives of this poor devil yet? -I'm sure she's heard about it by now. MICHAEL: Get my brother. He'll help me. -I never heard of no brother. -He's waiting for me at the fort north of town. -This could be a trap. They come ambush the whole posse up there. -Yes, they could. They could. -You know what to do in case he tries to escape. You got to go home to eat? -No sir, but I do have to go to the (WHISPERING) -Yes, of course, of course. I better get you a deputy anyway. -Thank you, sir. -Timothy. -O'Toole, ma'am. Timothy O'Toole. -That's uh, Irish ain't it? -Well no. It's actually Eskimo. See my grandfather was a full blooded galoot on his mother's side. Came to this country playing solo glockenspiel with Gilmore's band. -Uh-huh. Mine's Callie Burdyne. -Well now, that's pretty. -Nope. But I stopped fighting about it since I was 12. -Why was you shooting me? -Well, because there's not always time to ask questions before shooting, especially around this town. -What do you mean, this town up ahead? This uh, "Mo-lee" whatever. -"Molly be damn." "M-O-L-Y" Well, however it goes, it's "Molly be damn." -Kind of funny name to name a town. -[INAUDIBLE] What's that? -Oh, "Molly be damn," I mean. -Yeah well, I suppose so. Some of the high class folks, you know, the ladies and such, they call it "Molly-bedee," but it's "Molly be damn." -Mr. Carthy. -Splendid piece of work, sir. We're all proud of you. -Sir? Hey you kids over there. You're not old enough to be hanging around in front of the saloon. -Hi, Sheriff. -Hey, Sheriff. -No mood for none of your sass today either. Just break it up and go home. -Boy, Mr. Hatfield. I seen you when you took him in. -You sure put the dead wood on that criminal, sir. -Can I touch your shooting iron, Sheriff? -Is that the toughest hombre you've brought in so far? -We'll talk about it sometime, when I'm not so busy. Run along now. Go on. Scoot, scoot, scoot. -Yes sir, Sheriff. -Pardon me, ladies. -Oh dear, dear Mr. Hatfield, permit me to shake you by the hand. -Excuse me, old timer. [CHEERS] -Are you waiting for something to hatch? -Oh, well it's just that we don't often see somebody famous. Would you mind if I asked your height and weight? -Absolutely. -Were you ever athletical inclined? Because in most cases the more strenuous sports tend to develop certain portions of the body over others. -Look. I have this little baby brother who's waiting for me out at the north end of town. I'd hate for anything to happen to the little tad. -Some people you see look a little heavier on one side. You know what I mean? -So if you could just step up there and let him know that I'm here. -If it's not too personal, what size collar do you take? -What do you do for a living, O'Toole? -Oh it just depends on how I feel. Lots of times I don't even bother. -Yeah, that's what I sort of thought. You know, as soon as I saw you close on I says, now there's a man who looks too lazy to be a highway robber and too bright to be a cowboy. -Well thank you very much. -You got any kinfolks around here? -Yeah, I had earlier in the day. -Well they're kind of hard to lose. -Ain't that the truth. -(SHOUTING) I want a lawyer! -We haven't got no lawyer. You'll have to wait. -I am not young man. -Young as you'll ever be. Maybe as old. -Oh, it's going to be just beautiful. -Well be that as it may or may not, I still think it's a might previous. -Not to me, your Honor. The dream of my life for 26 years. -What happened to you 26 years ago? -That's when I watched my first one. -Your first what? Never mind. Just don't let it get too expensive. -Tell you what I'm going to do. -Try doing nothing, desperate. -Since I have a rigorous schedule ahead, matters of great pith and moment-- -I'd try to not even think about it until there I stood. -Instead of bringing charges against you and your slippery looking friend, the Mayor. False arrest, trespass on the case, defamation and slander, and so forth and so fifth. I have decided to pay the $2.00 and continue on my way forgetting the humiliation and discomfort of the day. -What do you mean? -Well, I like the cut of your jib, Hatfield. A certain misguided sense of civic responsibility, perhaps in excess of professional zeal, but you have a good face. And uh, a certain ruffian ability. You know, you're a credit to your parents. -Shoot. -No, no really. -Hell, Mr. L. -Mr. O. -You're not all bad yourself, except for your personal habits and outstanding charges. And whatever happens-- and I can tell you right now that they're going to-- it's nothing between you and I. I wonder if I could ask you for a personal favor? -What are friends for? -If it was for me I wouldn't put you through the trouble, but I got this little 10-year-old daughter who's been fussing at me for it. Would you sign your picture for my little girl? -Picture? -It'll make my little Fluffy proud as a boil. -A joke's a joke, Silas, but this one's beginning to smell of the keg. -You're not going to sign it? -If you give me that thing again, I'll-- -I don't mind a rotten criminal, Desperate, but a man who'd disappoint a little 10-year-old motherless child. -Wait til you see it. Wait til you see it? It's the prettiest one I've ever seen and so practical. -What? -Oh, go ahead and take a look. It's all yours anyway. -OK, Clem. Let it go. -All this excitement because some clunk decides to build a sawmill in "Molly be damn." Hell, with that ridiculous grin on your face, I, I thought maybe your mother-in-law had died. -Well this is Vandergelt money, Mr. Mayor. Pete Vandergelt and Sons, Limited, one of the biggest corporations in the world. -Dexter, money can't buy everything, you know. For instance money can't-- uh, uh, uh, hell, there must be something money can't buy. -If some big Eastern tycoon like Vandergelt got interested in a neighborhood like this, my goodness, it boggles the mind, your Honor. -Well it sure boggled mine. Dexter, I'll tell you what. In a situation of this magnitude, I think I better handle this whole thing myself. -You sure you don't mind, your Honor? -Mind, dear boy? That's what I'm here for. And uh, Dexter, keep it under your hat, huh? And don't you worry about a thing. -Thanks, Mayor. -Yeah, let's see now. MAYOR (VOICEOVER): A Regional Director, Mountain States Division, USA, P. Vandergelt and Sons Limited, Colorado Springs. Dear Sir, Flattered to here you are planning a lumber business in our fair city, particularly as seeing how the two previous sawmill ventures here proved to be such costly fiascoes in terms of money and human life. I am forced to confess though, that there is little chance of our ever getting around municipal ordinance number, uh, 1492, with forbids the diversion or obstruction of any natural stream or waterway within 15 miles of the city limits. -Why? MAYOR (VOICEOVER): Because of the grave and tragic problem we have around here with bandits, highway robbers, et cetera, et cetera. [LAUGHING] -See, you done it again, sis. -Did it again. -Went out joy riding and missed all the excitement. -You wash your face and hands, before you sit down to supper. O'Toole, this is my brother, Gurnie Burdyne. -How are you? I hope there's something to eat in this house. -He's a fine looking boy. You and he favor each other. -Shut up and eat. Excitement? -You going to the big dance tonight? -Hey, that's plenty, really. I've had enough. -What are we have another darn dance for? Use soap! -Spoke too late. -Gurnie. Every time you turn around it's another dance. -Thanks, Amen. -Don't know why he's always there though. Never does any dancing or anything, the mayor that is. -Tonight's the victory celebration. -Well, if it isn't one thing, it's a-- what victory? -Desperate Ambrose. -Well to tell you the plain unvarnished, I'm tired of him too. Would you pass him the muffins, please? -Callie, dear. If you're not going to the opera house tonight would you-- Oh. Oh. -Um, honey. Honey, this is Mr. Timothy O'Toole. This is my little sister, Prudence Burdyne. She gives voice and dance whenever there's anybody to take. -Pleased as I can be, miss. -Oh my goodness. Delighted, yes. -Oh honey, listen. If you're looking for my blue beaded baggy, you'll find it on top of my bureau. -Psst. -Mind your manners. Eat your supper. Both of you. -This man ain't even eaten. -Don't be like that, Desperate. -I'm not Desperate. -I'd be if I was you. -Don't pout around and peck at your food. That's not healthy. -If it's healthy you want, I could give up white bread. -It's no laughing matter. You got to keep yourself in tip top condition the next few days. You know what, it ain't just the hanging you've got to think about. We decided to have a trial first. And that's pretty strenuous too, Ambrose. -Don't call me Ambrose either. -You think you can remember that, Hatfield? And during his last days, it appears the condemned man would rather be addressed by the style and title of Mr. Littleberry. -The name's O'Toole. Michael James O'Toole. -You think I ought to dress up special for the hanging? Me being master of ceremonies and all. -Well I'm going just the way I am. You ought to put on a clean shirt though, Hatfield. You know that Judge Trumbell can get awfully fussy sometimes. -I hope the trial turns out all right. All that money spent building the gallows and such. -Say uh, you know something? If we could get that Judge Trumbell here permanent, we could have us a hanging every week. -I have to go early to help, but it's right on the way. -I don't know. It just seems kind of pushy to me. -I've never seen a real live desperado up close. It's always so crowded at a hanging. -Hi. This look all right for the cotillion? -Oh, lovely. -Looks as good on you as it did on Pa. That says something. -I'm supposed to grow into it, but there's no hurry. -Yes there is. The dancers need me. -I'm going to give you small time gildersleeves one last chance. -The stagecoach will be here about 10:00 in the morning. That'll have Judge Trumbell and the legal profession. -Old man Bedemeir, if he ain't dead yet, will represent the condemned man. -If we can have a lawyer for Ambrose, it sure will give it tone. -Well, Bedemeir expects to get paid. SHERIFF HATFIELD: Maybe the widow will chip in on that. -The widow? -Actually if I'm to prosecute, I expect to get paid too, you know. -Say we have to walk those two up and down a while. We can get the trial started around 11. Everybody go home for a bite to eat, and have the hanging right after dinner. -Hang, hang, hang, hang, hang. Is that all you can ever think about? -For what you've done over the years, Ambrose-- robbing the stage, waylaying the freight wagons, scaring off the customers, driving the commercial life of "Molly be damn" to rack and ruin-- capital punishment is the maximum penalty allowed under the law. -Done up this fancy, I feel like I was my brother, Michael. -He an Eskimo too? -No, he's been just about everything else though. Smart as a rash. Knows all about medicine and law. PRUDENCE: Oh, he's an attorney? -No, he's been connected with a few of them though. GURNIE: Does he do anything for a living? -Oh sure. Lectures for the Chautauqua, slight of hand, minstrel shows, sold oil stocks, been three kind of Baptist preacher, sings too. -He sounds like a very successful man. -I don't think he's tried that yet. -I sure hope we haven't hit you at your busy time, Mr. Hatfield. -Oh we just had to see that horrible male factor that's getting hung tomorrow. -Uh, uh, uh. You're not old enough to be hanging around no hanging. -Little brother! Bless your heart. The cavalry to the rescue. -Excuse me. Sir? -Get me out of this hick jail. Tell these hay seeds who I am. -Why certainly, Sir. You tell me, and I'll tell them. -Now you cut that out. -Oh, he's a mad dog all right. -Just like his picture. -Ladies, ladies. I'm going to have to ask you to leave in case he gets violent again. -Oh, all right. -I'm just mortified that a decent, God fearing man like you has to put up with this embarrassment, Mr. uh-- -Astor, John Jacob. National Sales Director, Celluloid Color Company. Just passing through your delight-- -You think this is some kind of game, young man. -Thing is, Mr. Astor, this here poor gallows bird keeps insisting he isn't himself. -Yes, well we all have days like that. -You can say that again. -I said, we all have days like that. -Timothy, stop clowning around. These yokels are gonna hang me. -Just for a little while, I'm sure. -Can this actually be happening to me? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Howdy, folks. And welcome to "Molly-be-dee." That'll be a dollar a couple and drinks extra. -Kind of caustic isn't it? -Well things in this town are rather expensive on account of the uh, Desperate Ambrose. -Even for a dance? -It's in his honor, ma'am. -Tourist trap. We ought to have our own hanging. -That's not a bad idea. -Bless you, sir. -What a gip. -Same to you, Percy. Let's see, there's one for them. Two for me. Two for me. And one for me. -All right, boys. Back to the dancing. All right now. -I can't figure it out. -What? -What he's up to, my brother, Michael. -Aw, you'll hear from him. Probably just doesn't know where to write to you. That's all. -He hardly ever writes any how. -You know, I've always said, they could make a real nice hall of this place, if they'd just fix it up some. -It's very tasty. Thank you. -You know, all they'd have to do is tack up some new drapes and such like that. [COUGHS] It is kind of rough. Clean up the place a bit. You know, some of the things on these walls have been here ever since Shep was a puppy. -Well that's strange. -That is Desperate Ambrose. It's a very good likeness. -How long has that poster been there? -Oh, about five or six years. They ought to could take them down now, unless they wan to wait until after the funeral. -You mean, there really is a Desperate Ambrose? -Until sometime tomorrow, yeah. Oh, we saw him over to the jail tonight. -Callie, that man in jail isn't an outlaw. That's my brother, Michael. -Maybe that's why he hasn't written you. Are you sure? -Yeah, I got to go find that Sheriff. -Oh. -Mi, mi, Mister Hatfield. Excuse me. It is not her he wanted. It's you. -I don't think that would look too good. -Sir, there's a terrible mistake going on. -How's that, Mr. Astor? -No, Astor was just a joke. My name's Timothy O'Toole. -You see, Timothy can get off some real whoppers when he's in the mood. -You know that man you're going to hang. -Desperate Ambrose. I sure hope you can stay for it. -They'll have refreshments following the melancholy demise. GURNIE: It's not Desperate Ambrose. It's Michael O'Toole. -What a sneaky scoundrel. All these years having me think his name's Littleberry. Good one on me. -Mr. Hatfield, look. I don't think you understand. What he's trying to you is, you've got the wrong man. -Well that's what Ambrose said. I wouldn't believe him on a stack of Bibles. -Well Timothy ought to know. He's his brother. -Well if I can't believe what Ambrose says, I can't believe his brother either. -You're sure it's your brother? -Well I ought to be. I've known him all my life. -You know who would know for sure, if anybody would? It's Paloma. -Paloma? -Mrs. Desperate. As she's married to him. -Thank you. Excuse me. PALOMA: It's not locked. -Oh, don't do that. -No magazine subscriptions, no patent medicines, and I don't want my picture in the paper. -Look, I need your help awful bad. -Come in. Don't get no ideas neither. -Uh, you know the-- -Sit down. -You know the man they've got in jail? -Do I know that man? -Yes, that's right. -My momma told me the first day she ever laid eyes on him. But did I listen? No, I didn't listen. Time and time again, she said, you stay away from AJ Littleberry. He's nothing but trash. -Well, be that as it may, miss-- PALOMA: I didn't listen. And what have I got to show for it. A house, and lot, and a trunk full of mustache cups. Can you imagine someone collecting mustache cups? -No, not right off hand, but-- -All the big things he was going to do for his Paloma, his dove. His pigeon. Oh, why'd I have to listen to him instead of Mama. -What I really came to tell you-- -Desperate. I'm the one that's desperate. The roof leaks. The stove don't draw. And not one stinking dime from that man. He's sitting over there in that jail like a big shot. Living high on the hog on the taxpayers' money. He doesn't care what happens to any little pigeon. He's selfish to the bone. -That poor man-- -Does he have to worry about that roof leaking or the stove not drawing? No. He's probably got women sneaking in and out of there. I hadn't meant to bring that up. -Mrs. Paloma, now please. -Yeah, honey? -Look, they're going to hang-- -Well of course they're going to hang him. And I'm going to be sitting in the front row. I'm entitled. A widowed woman still got some rights. TIMOTHY: I've come to you for help. -You want me to help pull the trap? You know what that mealy mouthed big shot done to me? -It's not him. -He stole my mama's picture, the only one I had, in a sterling silver plated frame too. -That's my brother over there. -Ambrose doesn't have a brother. -Look, would you just go and see? Would you just go talk to him? -After he stole my only pair of earrings, my watch, and my sewing machine from the catalogue? Never. He's worse than an outlaw. He's a thief. -Maybe if you'd go to the trial. I mean, one good look at my brother. -I'll come to the trial all right. And to the hanging, and to the burying. And I'll be the first one to throw dirt in the grave too. Good night, Mr. O'Toole. Sure was a pleasure talking to you. -Walking through the village streets and the amber waves of rhubarb, playing waggish pranks and didos. Telling drolled taradiddles for the entertainment of the bourgeois. -I said I'm sorry, didn't I? What more can I say? -Where did did you get that ridiculous Sunday school costume? -I just borrowed it. My stuff's being washed and fumigated. -Oh, good boy. Personal daintiness, very important when all you can concentrate on is chasing women. -What do you want me to do, Michael? -Go home, have a glass of milk and cookies, and go sleepy bye without a care in the world. -I'll think of something. -Think of old Michael from time to time over the passing years, a simple spray of wild flowers to mark the grave. And if the whim should strike you, a modest ruffian stone to mark the final resting spot. And have them carve upon the stone the homely little thought that steered me through shoals of brief mortality. -Is there anything you need in the meantime? -Count that day lost whose low descending sun seized from thy hand no worthy action done, such as today. -All right, Michael. I'll get you out of this jail, if I have to dig you out. -Now you're beginning to think constructively. -Hey, Timothy. -What? -What are you doing down there? -You notice I don't even mention that's a silly question. -I mean, but why? -Look, I've still got one living relative, if I can manage to dig him out of that bird cage. -I know a shortcut. -Into the jail? -Pretty near. -Well, I'd say this represents a considerable savings of time and perspiration. -Might as well use it as long as it's here. Nobody else does. -Huh, wonder why? -Because of "molly-be-durn." -What is that moly stuff? "Molly-be-durn" is what we have in the mines around here, instead of ore. They started digging the stuff thinking it was lead. It turned out what it is. Not much of anything really. -Huh. -A fellow came through once, a Dutchman. He was a professor of rocks and stuff. He looked at the stuff and said right off it was "molly-be-durn." So that's what people start calling the place for lack of anything else. It's really "Molly be D-A-M." It's in the dictionary and all. -What's it good for? -Mainly nothing. That's it. --That's what? -Back end of jail. -Well, I'm much obliged to you, Gurnie. Good night. -Well it's still early, O'Toole. Good night, Gurnie. -Aw, can't you do anything right? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh woodwind, woodwind. Remember this is a march funebre. It mustn't get too perky. Once again, gentlemen, from the letter A. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I just don't know what gets into people. You try to make things nice, try to make a better world in which to live, and they just can't leave it alone. -Well if some of these mothers and fathers around here would take a strap to the hide to some of these little-- -Plain and simple vandalism. -I don't like that mine shaft being uncovered like the Harmon. You better patch it up as soon as we tear this thing down. -Tear it down? -Stagecoach planning to get in on schedule? Very valuable human cargo today, bar and bench. Got the whole judicatory system this part of the state aboard. -In suits of common law where the value in controversy shall exceed $20. -Feel better, don't you? Oh, it's an exciting day, Mr. Ambrose. And what glorious weather for it. 'Tis a privilege to live in Colorado. -'Tis if you can keep at it long enough. -Probably the biggest day we've had since the mind shut down, a festive day, and all for you, Desperate. -If it's too strenuous, I may not survive it. -Oh, you are feeling better. That was a witticism, wasn't it? -This is very kind of you, Lovejoy. The bath, the save, the haircut. -Well, as a wise man said, don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. -You know, this is a new experience for me. I've never barbered anyone who was sitting up before. -Oh, Arch, just hang the clothes on the bars there. -Boo. -How's that? -That's uh, much, much better actually. -I have to take credit for the music myself. I sent to Denver for the part. -You shouldn't have. -Sorry we didn't have time to spruce up your own garments. But we will have you looking absolutely elegant for the trial nonetheless. You see, most the time we just have the crowd behind singing "Nearer, My God, to Thee" and let it go at that. -Let what go? -Let's try this on you. -You know, when a band plays real music-- oh, you'll need both hands. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. -What did you say the piece was? -Handel. "The Dead March from Saul." Oh, we're so lucky I had your size in stock. -In point of fact-- -Yes. -In so far as the function and the competence of this judicial circuit-- -I'll drink to that. -This county and the next should be discontinued. -Let the record so state. -Forsaken little mud hole like "Mu," "Mo--" It just don't justify. -I'll drink to that, Judge. -Last time I came through here, there was two cases of aggravated assault and one man beat his wife. -She still owes me. -Didn't have time for breakfast again this morning. You know, this end of the circuit, they got no compunctioncy, no gumption, insufficient spizzerinctum. -And takes guts to get ahead in this world. -We pass that grizzled old prospector yet? -Hard Rock? The one with the jackass? -Well, one of them is. -Haven't seen them yet. Everything's running a little late this morning. -I think you're right, Benoni. We haven't even had the hold up yet. [GUN SHOTS] That's it. [GUN SHOTS] -Let's see. I wonder if it's going to be on time. Yeah. Here it comes. [CHEERING] -How are ya there? -Nice to see ya. -Hi, Judge. I think we've got a live one for you. -Hehe. Not for long. -For some reason, I'm feeling tired today. -I'm tired of living like this. -I be hungry. I don't care who know it. -Rotting down here in this cesspit fool of fool's gold, doing ambush with a bunch of dummies. -Work your fingers to the bone, don't get nothing to show for it. -So hungry the big gut eating the little gut. -There's plenty to eat around here, Tyler. Have some more peanut butter. Have a dipper of milk. -Peanut butter always been the fondest thing I'm of up to right recent. I wish somebody would ship some crackers through here. -Been washing down mines with so much condensed milk, I'm about to start squeaking and sprouting horns. -All you people do from morning to night is nag, nag, nag. I can't stand much more of it. -All those things you were going to do for us, Ambrose. We could stave to death for all you care. -I got feelings. -Peanut butter needs something to eat with besides just a spoon. -I can get all this at home. -Most of the old gang's gone now, every one of them a success. -Old Murph's the most wanted up in Nebraska. And Spittoon, a successful cattle rustler. -Cattle rustler? That's what we ought to would. -If I said it once, I said it time again. -Anything you ever said once, Happy, you said time and again. -Well there's a certain kind of people you can't tell nothing to. -Maybe you'd like to try to take over running this company? You shut up too. -Hey, it's old Hard Rock. Howdy, Hard Rock. -Hi there, Tyler, Forty Rod, Happy. I thought you was mad at me or something, Desperate. -Hey, you ain't got no cheese with you or anything like that. -What you mean mad? -Because you rode right past me on Main Street yesterday, never even said hey. -Or, or maybe some sody crackers? -You talk just as crazy as these people do. -I felt real bad when you was captured. -I've never been captured in my life. -Just as sorry as I can be, Desperate. Because I seen it, when they done it. You rode in, got off, and Hatfield taken you. -I wasn't in no town yesterday. -Come to think of it, they've still got you down there. You didn't pass me on the road coming in. -You sure it was me? -The trials this morning and the hanging right after dinner. Oh, I would have stayed for it, but I have so much else to do. -I think we ought to all go, at least for the hanging. -That's a good idea. -One's a plenty. And that's me. -You've said all that before, Desperate. Don't call me that again. -And as you attorney, Probably the last one you'll ever have, I say you've got to think of something better. -I can think of something better. Why don't we get a decent lawyer? -Sleeping Beauty here is the only lip this side of Denver. -Howdy, Mayor. -How does that trout qualify for a front seat? He can't even carry a tune. -It's the wife. -What wife? -Mrs. Desperate. Paloma. I hope you're satisfied, AJ. And I hope you get it good. -Madam? -Ah, Mrs. Desperate. Nice you could come. -Get away you creepy cop. -And if there's any way I can be of service. -Morning, dad. Comfortable? -Can't com-- (OLDER VOICE) Can't complain. -Good. Good. Rise, please. Here ye, here ye. The honorable circuit court of the district, et cetera, and the state of Colorado is now in session. Honorable Quincy P Trembell, Junior presiding. -That's enough. -All people having business before this court is over in terminer and jail delivery, draw near that you may be heard. -Oh. -The first case, your Honor. -Means more than one? -They only gave me one, Judge. -The case, may it please the court, sir. -Just get on with it. -I object. -Uh, your Honor. In the uh, matter of the people of the sovereign state of Colorado, (MUMBLING) and so forth, versus AJ Littleberry, doing business as Desperate Ambrose, the indictment charges bank robbery, highway robbery, holding up and busting up a public tavern, assault with a deadly weapon, assault without a deadly weapon, battery and mayhem, and the intent, grand and petty larceny, illegal diversion, conspiring, and highway mopery with intent to got. -AJ Littleberry, how do you plead? -What? -Shh. -The bailiff said, how does he plead? -It's my client. Nobody asked you anything. -Prisoner stands mute? -I've got plenty to say. -Not guilty, your Honor. -May it please the Court, your Honor. In this case, the state is being represented by the city. So ordered. Prisoner at the bar, you've been tried by a jury of your peers and found guilty as charged. -We haven't had the trial yet. -Well let the record so state. And the uh, court will take it under consideration as a mitigating factor. This is no precedent. -In the matter before the court, counsel for the defense is at a loss. -Well, he'll get his money. -Not from me. -In as much as my client, AJ Littleberry, declines to cooperate and challenges the authority of this court on the pretext that he is not, in fact, AJ Littleberry. -Can he do that, Benoni? -It's a free country. -Witness is hostile, your Honor. -The point in question is irrelevant, immaterial, and irresponsive. De minimis non. The law does not concern itself with trifles. Next case. -And gentlemen of the jury, since first this vicious malefactor swooped down upon us like a wolf upon the fold. -On the what? -A manner of speaking, your Honor. Upon the fair and peaceful community of "Mo-li-bi-dul," "Mo-la-bor-al," "Ma-lob-a-du" -(CORRECTLY) Molybdenum [APPLAUSE] -"Molly be damn." A fiscal gloom has overlaid the sparkling Colorado air. An awful stillness permeates the marketplace. Stagnation is rampant, my friends, and grass is growing in the city streets. Preachers will not come to "Molly be damn." -You're a remarkably attractive woman. I have the feeling we've met somewhere before. -Forced. I say, forced to pay higher prices for merchandise, what there is of it. Prices, which are dangerously noncompetitive, if there was any competition-- -What case are we on, Benoni? -Still on Ambrose, I think. We'll never get out of here. -And terrified the stage coach. -No such thing. -Of all the brass, Ambrose. Not two hours ago coming into town you gave me such a turn I couldn't take my medicine. -I don't even know you. -Defense will call its next witness. -I'd like to call this young lady seated right behind, intelligent looking, well bred girl. -What? Who? -Mrs. Desperate Ambrose. -He can't do that. -But out. -Prosecution's right, your Honor. Wife can't testify against her husband. -Maybe right, Benoni. -I'd like to say something. -Lie. -You're not allowed to pass sentence until I do. When I look about me at this fruitful and bucolic spot, its spacious skies, its amber waves of grain-- -Your Honor, I beseech you. -Purple mountain majesties above the fruited plain. I look upon this little lady, and all little ladies, God bless them, with awe and reverence. I'll tell you why. -If you can make it brief. -Because all that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother. My mother was a lady. -And his father was a bachelor. [LAUGHTER] -Look at this tender creature, this symbol of pioneer womanhood at its best, the proud bearing, the sparkling eye, the slender toil worn fingers. -He's drunk as an owl. -He's lovely. -He's out of his mind. -It's too late to change his plea. -Sustained. -When I stand here, in this hallowed hall of justice in the land of the home and the free of the brave, and hear a duly constituted officer attack the very principles. -She still can't testify against her husband. -It's not my husband, and I got as much right as anybody. That scoundrel is an imposter. -You should have thought of that before you married him. -That scoundrel is my husband. [SCREAMS] [GUN SHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] -No funeral, gentlemen. There's just nobody dead. -To the Brothers O'Toole. Two of the best things that ever happened to Molly be damn. You're good help. -The last time I encountered such magnificent pheasant, it was under glass, served up to me by my great and good Delmonico. -Of New York, New York? -Mm. -I never knew you were-- -Looking good, Timothy. Very becoming when your mouth is closed. -Pheasant? Pheasant? You know if that mean old rooster had heard you say that about him, he'd have gone a lot happier. -The quintessence of art, my dear, and of life. Many a tough old bird has melted a the touch of a woman's hand. -Oh my. Are you sure you have to leave? -Aw, all that's a lot of bodewash. But it is pretty. You know, we're going to miss you. We're going to miss you a lot. -Mr. Michael? -Yes, my boy. -Are you fixing to shoot it out with anybody for locking you up? -Gurnie. -Young man, men of culture and refinement seldom stoop to such barbaric tactics. Gentlemen scholars don't do that. -They forgive, Gurnie, and forget. -What they do is they sue the man for every nickel he's got. -Which is what we call civilization. -I don't, uh, think the Sheriff's got a nickel. But you could sue the Mayor. He's got a lot of cigars. TIMOTHY: And very good cigars, Michael. -Well he must have won a contest somewhere, because he sure ain't getting rich from them dances. -Oh, we don't even have that. With my lessons and Callie's boarding-- -And 25,000 shares of stock in that lousy mine. -And two rooms of used gambling stuff from when we was going to be a big old boom town. -Why don't you use it? -What? -The unused gambling stuff. -Oh, the Ladies Aid wouldn't stand for it. -You thinking the way I'm thinking? -No. But I'm only three or four steps ahead of you. -We're staying. -A gambling casino here in Molly be damn? -A respectable, well regulated, death fall squire, a liquor license, of course, a few, purely decorative, dancing girls. -All sending money home to their mothers. -You've got the cast iron crust to drag me up here in the middle of the night. Me, the chief executive of this crummy town, with a rotten immoral suggestion like that. -Ordinarily Zeke, I'd I go right past you and leave you to rot. But you control the licenses, the building, half the dry goods store, and maybe the Ladies Aid. -Well that's neither here-- -I bet he owns 60% of Desperate Ambrose too. -60%? -That's about what he skims off at the dances. -That's true. -You shut up. -I'll uh, I'll think about it. -A gambling H, E, double L? Right here in Molly be D? -Madam, if you'd stop to think for a minute. -I'd be sick. -A saloon de chance. That is to say, in the genteelest continental tradition, the proceeds redounding subsequential civic assets, including, but not confined, to the downtown park, circulating library, and a lyceum, of course. -Uh-uh. Don't talk vulgar. -Well don't interrupt. -Oh, don't stop. -Eli, would you suggest a site for the lyceum? -I'd suggest the Saloon de Chance. -Saloon de Chance? MAYOR (VOICEOVER): Uh, uh, Chairman of the Board, Titanic Steel Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA. Dear Sir, Some jokers in town setting up a gambling hall here, and thinks it will bring a lot of tourists and money into Molly be damn. And, and it just might do it. He's opening on the 23rd. Well what am I gonna do? -All very sudden. -It could drive the decent industry out of town all together. -Ah, we'd be overrun with drifters, saddle tramps. -Hundreds of them. -And soldiers and cowboys. -Tourists from as far away as Colorado Springs. -With all that money? -Tainted money. -And so much of it. -I don't know what's come over all you people. -Greed. MICHAEL: Move this out just a bit. Right here but out just a bit. Are the chips here? No, no, no, no. The table against the wall, please. I want a dancing girl there-- please, move this out-- a dancing girl here. -Speaking of dancing girls, do you want a girl over the bar instead of the horses? -Timothy, except for the direst of circumstances the woman should always come before the horse. These plans must be paid attention to. CHAIRMAN (VOICE OVER): What do you mean, want do you do? First, you try to remember, you silly little man, what we've been paying you for all this time. -Yes, sir. Yes indeed, sir. CHAIRMAN (VOICE OVER): If it ever leaked out to certain parties what you're sitting on on that God forsaken hole out there, this could jeopardize the value of our present holdings, cost us millions in obsolete processes and machinery, cause the collapse of some of the leading issues on the big board, and possibly deliver Titanic Steel, itself, into the hands of certain enemies, which I do not have to name, even to you, you preposterous little toad. -Do you mean, brigadier? CHAIRMAN (VOICE OVER): The day that casino opens, is the day you close. -Timothy, my boy. Under my tutelage as entrepreneur, this blighted little hamlet could become the Paris, France of the Eastern Rockies. -Fixing to have another dance in here? -Not in your lifetime or mine, son. Too busy making money. -Making money? How? -There ain't no money in "Molly be damn." -Ain't no money anywhere. -They sure in heck making something desperate. They way you're charging around down there, it's a caution to behold. -Reckon they're up to something? -And I sure would admire to know what. -If it was to me, I'd ask. -I don't have to ask you about asking somebody something. -Big day coming up, your Honor. I hope to be over my cold by then. -Yeah, we're sure counting on you, Lubie. -That's the fourth Friday? -No, I believe it's a Wednesday this time. -You got a minute, your Honor? -Yeah, what is it, boy? -[BURP] -Oh, that's really something, ain't it. -Off hand, it's a loading dock at Sears Roebuck. -Right, with solid gold walls. Let them loose. -You sent for us, my man? -I ask the questions around here. -Pretty serious business, abducting peaceful citizens from the public streets. -And we had to abduct the horses too. -And that's a hanging offense. -Hey, pardon me friend. I'm dying for a drink of water. -I'll say one thing, he's a homely looking brute. I don't know who you are hombre, or what your game is, but you've been nothing but trouble to me since you done road into this parts. He is the one that road, ain't he? -That's right. It was the goofy looking one was walking. -I want you to roll up your [INAUDIBLE], jump on your horse, and take it on the lam. And if you're within 20 miles of here come sun down-- -You know what these people are? -Well, I wouldn't know how to say it. -Losers, eight balls, a bunch of schlimazels. -Folks has died of lead poisoning that hasn't aggravated me near this much. -You know, despite your less than pre-possessing appearance, my boy, I like the cut of your jib. Tell you what I'm going to do for you. -How you mean? -I have plans for that mangy little town down there, and you are blocking the aisles. If your career can be guided into the paths of righteousness, diverse and sundry of us can become rich beyond the dreams of Avarice. -Where's that? -First off, I want you to go straight. Stop chasing people up and down the roads. Become a prosperous and peace loving citizens. -What for? -5% of the net. -Of the net? -Whatever that is. -Sounds like more than we've been getting. PALOMA: Uh! Uh. -Paloma, my little bird. Listen to me. You're my love. -Love! Don't you talk to me about love, you two bit shoplifter. -I'm talking about money. -When it's you talking, AJ, I don't even believe in that anymore. -You got to have faith in me. You're my little bird, my little high land plover. -Don't you start talking like that again. You get me all mixed up. What the hell is that? -Just some little prairie blossoms, and each one is a thought of you. The Yellow Butterwood, the Brown-eyed Susan, the shy shrinking Gracewood, the Dog's Toot Violet. -Something that sells for money. -You think I'd take money from a woman? -And the sugar bowl it's hid in. -That's all over, honey. I'll get you a dozen sugar bowls. Can't you see I've changed? -I can't see much of anything in you. My mama told me the first day she ever laid eyes on you. -Your blessed mother, your dear mother, she's a living saint. -I saw that. You call my mama an evil eye? -You're my soul mate. Your life of my heart. All I want is you. This kind of life is bad for us. The hardship, the ache and loneliness of separation, not having you at my side. And for what? For money? Fame? I'm going to give up my career. I'm going straight. -Straight where? -Home to you. -Oh, I can't afford it! -You ain't gonna have to worry about money again. I got business connections with the Mayor and O'Toole. I'm gonna be there partner. -Partner in what? Selling cloverine salve, Saturday Evening Posts? -I'm gonna be financial advisor to the new casino, a solid business man. I ain't got to go to work no more. I can be at home, with you, my little dove, fluttering about. -Feeding you, waiting on you hand and foot. -You gonna be in society with all them ladies. -I need new clothes. -Sure. -And my sewing machine from the catalog. I want that back. And my mama's picture with the frame. -I'm gonna get you a new frame, solid gold plated. Anything you wants gonna be yours. -Anything? -I'm putty in your hands, my little White Throated Swift. -Well AJ, I'm tired of pretending. I want to get married, ring and everything, flower girls, you know, all that bride stuff. -Married! That's the damndest thing I ever heard of. -Man and wife for six years! What's wrong with getting married? -All my friends, Tyler, Happy, Forty Rod, they'd laugh at me. -Laugh? Well you just let them feed you, let them take care of you. You gonna marry me or not? -I'm gonna think it over. -You! [SCREAMING] -You try to be nice to a woman, she'll take advantage of you every time. You just remember that. -Doesn't really matter does it? I mean she hasn't been holding up the stagecoach. -A contract is a contract. We'll proceed with the opening. -Sure is exciting, ain't it Neal. Which one you aiming to try out for? -Heck Dex, I'm signing up for all three. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ONE PERSON CLAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] -Elder McGee. -[BURP] [APPLAUSE] -Hog Smith. [BOOING] [BURP] -Danny Smithers. 21 feet, 6 inches. Lindsay Grill. 4 feet, 2 inches. Tiny Redskin. [BURP] Baby Betty. [BURP] [APPLAUSE] -A geyser. Timothy O'Toole. [BURP] The new champion, the winner, Timothy O'Toole. -Frigid spell, Timothy. Mary of the Gail, Saint Patrick's Day in the morning. -There something wrong, Michael? -I have in my time visited three political conventions, four sessions of Congress, and two homes for the criminally insane. I have known army generals, steam doctors, vegetarians, prohibitionists, and a female suffragette. But never, even in an Orangemen's Day parade, have I seen such pure and stainless brainlessness, as I now behold in you. The Almighty in his infinite wisdom and mercy, has given the worm enough sense to turn with, and the barnacle can grasp whatever happens to be standing by. But you are equipped with a mental capacity smaller than you were born with. Here we are, benighted in the middle of a nowhere named "Molly be damned," a dreary little rookery, Timothy. A squalid sty, a festering pustule on the face of the Western slope. Bless the town and bless the people. Look at them, the rabble of this cantankerous community, knaves and fools, louts and lard heads The least of all God's creatures, without enough push to pick the fleas off each other. Abiding in putrefaction and inertia, curled up comfy in it, like hogs in a mud hole. And while I, of all people, fret and sweat for a way to pull these simple Simon's out of the bog, you stand around making flatulent noises for the titillation of the vulgar mob. And while he's bubbling himself, what are you doing? You pusillanimous pack of popcorn pickers! You clouded clutch of clucks! The town dilapidating around you, coasting downhill in a handcart to hell, while you stand about gaping for flies and going patty cake with your hands. -Now, now just one minute, you. -All right. All right. All right. Fine. Keep it. And treasure it the way it is. For when all this trash has collapsed into one pile, and the howling wilderness has claimed its own again, I want you hicks to be happy. Belching and spitting, laughing and singing, swinging from tree to tree, with your friend, Soapy Sam here, the [INAUDIBLE] heap of the hook worm belt, standing around below, waiting to steal anything that falls to the ground. If a nut should drop and fall, leave it lying there. It's probably my little brother, Timothy. -Is that all? [CLAPPING] -By acclamation, the winner of the cussing contest, Michael O'Toole. [APPLAUSE] -Excuse me, your name O'Toole? -Yeah, do something to me. -Mr. MacClanahan? I found him Mr. MacClanahan. -Well O'Toole, long time, isn't it? -Papa, you're gonna hate yourself. -I don't think we've ever met. -We'll make up for it. Willy, you get down his name and all that. -Wylie, find a preacher, find a judge, find something. -Papa! -One, two, three. [MUSIC - WEDDING MARCH] -That's terrible. -It's unbearable. The Funeral March was at least cheerful. -I don't mean that. I mean the fix you got yourself in this time. -Timothy, you got to do something. -What more can I do, Michael? It hasn't been easy being both father and mother to a wild, irresponsible, young man. I turn my back and one minute you're getting hung, or married, or what's it going to be next, Michael? -Get me out of here. -Well, maybe marriage is the thing for you though. Help you settle down, get over your wild ways. Goodness knows nothing else has. -Timothy, on my honor, I never saw that [INAUDIBLE] before in my life. -Don't talk vulgar. -All right? -Nothing I can do. I can't but into no family matter. -Family? -If she's in a family way. -Look, when somebody's pointing a gun at your head, is that a bona fide legal marriage? -I'm not sure. Ask the Mayor about that. -Where can I find the Mayor? -You'll see him at the wedding. He'll be sitting in the front row. -I ain't never been a bridesmaid previous. -Aw heck, honey. There ain't nothing to it. Now stop jiggling around. You're going to get stuck. -Don't you think one of the ladies in the town should be bridesmaid? -Listen, anybody who can make Desperate Ambrose go straight is lady enough for this town. -Well that's kind of previous too. -Everybody, bet some decent clothes on. We're going into town. -Now don't worry, Michael. I'm going to think of something. -If nothing occurs to you in the next two or three minutes, don't give it another thought. -Uh, excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? -Not until after the wedding. -Blast your buttons, Jackson. Where in Hades are we? -I'm sure we're all right, Brigadier Vandergelt, sir. -If we're lost, Jackson, you'll never work in Wall Street again. -There's a little place ahead, sir. They'll know where we are. -If I owned this place I'd put up street signs. -The name of the place, Brigadier sir is "Mo-ly," "Mo-le," you'll see. -Molybdenum? A town named Molybdenum? Yo boy, on the double. -What's the trouble, sir? -Why is everything in this miserable little slum named Molybdenum? Speak up. -Says "Molly be darn," sir, name of the town. -Young man, when Brigadier Palonius Vandergelt-- -Oh, shut up. Here boy, be bright and be brisk. Why is it the name? -That's the name of the stuff we have in the mine instead of ore, sir. Thought it was lead, sir. But a fellow came through-- -Oh hogwash, boy. There's no molybdenum this side of Peru, and confounded little of it there. -We've got a whole mountain full of "Molly be durn," sir . -A mountain full? A mountain full of molybdenum? [MUSIC PLAYING - "WEDDING MARCH"] -What if this is all a horrible mistake? -Fine time to think about that now. -Eureka! It's "Molly be damn!" -I don't believe we've met. My name is Bonnie Lou MacClanahan. -You're not supposed to talk. -Is it worth anything, sir? -Worth anything, you idiot. Put it into steel, it's worth $30 million in razor blades alone. Call my lawyers. Call my banker. I want everybody out here on the next train. And get me JP Morgan. I want to talk to him. -There's no telephones around here. -Then put them in, Jackson. Immediately. And, and buy this building for an office, and buy that one. Oh save time, by them all, -Well, if it's marriage she wants, I'll marry her. Dumb woman with her mouth going all the time. See you later. DESPERATE: Paloma, my bird. Betrayed. [GUN SHOTS] -Ma'am, let a sick man through. -Tell the telephone company I want full service out of here in all directions by Monday noon. No excuses. -Yes, sir. -Square line railroad out of Denver, double tracks, start construction immediately. -Yes, sir. -Who, who's the governor of this state? You there. I can't think with all that going on. Go play somewhere else. -Yes, sir. -Rich! All of us rich! Mine stock worth a fortune! -20 years of faithful service to Titanic Steel, I got stock in nickel, tungsten, vanadium, not one stinking share of "Molly be damn." -You and your big promises. Uh. Everybody in this stinking town is rich now, except us! That lousy stock, they was just giving it away. But you didn't get any, did you? No. You was too lazy. All you ever got anywhere, AJ, is them lousy mustache cups! What in the blitzes are you doing? Oh, Ambrose. -My little prairie falcon. -Oh, you sure do know how to make a woman happy. -60,000 shares. -We've never been formally introduced, sir. We have many mutual friends. My name is-- -O'Toole. The last time I saw you, you stole my horse. MR. MACCLANAHAN:O'Toole! -Some other time. -Papa, you're not even fair. -Come out, O'Toole. Face her like a man. O'Toole! Come out! Wherever you are! -Man comes up to me, calls out, your name O'Toole? We're looking for somebody named O'Toole. -It's a common name. I've know many. -Timothy. -Michael? -I've got to be running along, but I want you to do the decent thing. I want you to marry that girl. -Marry her? I hardly know the girl. -Hm. Well, but if the matter comes up again-- -Yeah. MR. MACLANAHAN: O'Toole! -Woo! -Wow. -Listen! Anybody got any ideas for supper? -How about pheasant? -Under glass. -I think we can do it. Come on. Let's go. -Actually, any day you break even, it's not a total loss. -Nah. Not as long as you're healthy. [MUSIC PLAYING]
