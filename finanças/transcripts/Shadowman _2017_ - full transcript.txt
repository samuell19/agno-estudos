[dog barking in distance] [muttering] Look at this. Pathetic. [man] The story of Richard Hambleton is as mysterious as his black shadow figures. [woman] Richard's paintings-- They're dark, they're beautiful, they're chaotic. ♪ Ghost rider moves Like a hero♪ [man 2] Richard was one of the most interesting, enthralling, ecstatic artists coming out of New York in the '80s. ♪ He's looking so cute♪ [man 3] At that time, he was much more successful than Basquiat. Basically, he was the only artist that I couldn't buy. [man 4] The man's a genius. He really is. [man 5] He's such a crazy dreamer visionary that often it seems like madness. I think there's a certain amount of passion involved in what I do [man 6] He was an absolute wild man. [woman 2] He was sexy, he was attractive. [man 7] He was not normal. The guy was weird. ♪ Be-be-be-be-be He's a-screamin' away♪ This work isn't-- You know, it's conceptual. My brain is going to fall apart if I don't get it out. [man 8] He's so self-destructive. But he won't die. [man 9] How can somebody so dark and dingy be heroic? But somehow he is. [man 10] One of the big mysteries about Richard Hambleton is why he does some of the things he does. [man 11] In the midst of becoming the most important thing in New York, with Basquiat, with Keith Haring, he leaves. [woman 3] He removed himself from the scene, and when you remove yourself from the scene, you disappear, and when you disappear, you're invisible, and that's what happened to him. [horn honking] [knocking] Richard! You gonna open up? Richard, it's Andy. I'm out at the front. Can you please answer the door? [knocking] Be right down.What's going on there? I just woke up.Oh, really? I'm so tired. I just slept. Have a good sleep?Yeah. All right. [Hambleton] I built every little thing in this place. The fire department went through and they said, "You don't live here, do you? You don't sleep here?" I was in almost every publication in the world. Lifemagazine, Peoplemagazine. Voguemagazine,I had like five pages. You know, this wasn't planned. [Valmorbida] What everyone says to me, when Richard Hambleton comes up, like, "Oh, he's still alive?" I'm like, "Yeah, he's around." They're like, "We haven't heard him or seen him in 20 years." What made you hide for 20 years?I wasn't hiding. What were you doing?I was painting. I was working. I was barely surviving. An artist can't get it together without collectors and galleries. What was it like not doing an art show for 25 years? -It was frustrating. -It was frustrating, right? I wanted to show, basically, I don't know why. I kept trying to get things together. I kept being ripped off by people, and I was in the street, like, living-- -You were homeless, right? -Yeah, basically. There's a lot of artists that have patrons that don't show for 10 to 15 years. But they keep-- They do keep working. This is that seascape. Where are these paintings now? That was in his show in Milan and where it went from there, it was sold. Who knows? [laughs] And that was quite some time ago. -Where did you grow up? -Vancouver. [man] His whole childhood is kind of a mystery. I know he started when he was very little. He drew and painted when he was just a kid. He was just doing it. [man] Richard's a formally trained artist. He went to school. But he moved away from that real quickly. He's always on the fringe. [Hambleton] I created a murder scene... which was experienced by the public as a murder. They'd wake up, walk outside and think, "Who died here?" [Hambleton] I was lucky enough to get a grant from the city of Vancouver, so I did the serial murder down the West Coast. You know, it was a mission. [man] Richard went from Canada to Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles. Then he worked his way across the United States to New York. [siren wailing] [man] I was down in Tribeca one evening. Of course, Tribeca at that time was nothing like it is now. In fact, parts of it were totally bombed out. There was nothing there but rubble. But I saw one of these cutouts there, and it had the red paint in it. And it looked like blood. I was like, "We gotta get out of here. This is a dangerous part of the city." [tires screech] [Hambleton] It was a murder mystery narrative. [Valmorbida] What made you want to do them? -I wanted to paint realism. -[siren wailing] [man] ♪ I can't seem To face up to the facts♪ ♪ I'm tense and nervous♪ [TV newscaster] With a 25% increase in murder, New York again led the nation in the number of murders last year. ♪ Don't touch me I'm a real live wire♪ Violence has become epidemic. ♪ Psycho killer Qu'est-ce que c'est ♪ When people see that one person can do it, then they think they can too. ♪ Run, run, run Run, run, run♪ ♪ Run away♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh♪ [Woodward] The whole thing was a psychological experiment. How can he affect society with his art? I think what Richard was trying to tell people is that there are no boundaries. No one's really protected. The moment you step outside, we're all possibly victims. ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh♪ At that time, there wasn't any kind of concept of public art. I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene. And then, at another time stumbling on another one, and I started to realize, well, maybe this is something else. But not really having any language for it. [man] It was kind of like beyond art. It was performance. It was also street art. It was a drama. It came with a story attached to it. It's more than just aesthetics, it's more than just painting and surface. It was like a murder mystery story. Image Mass Murderwas a mass murder. It was done in 15 cities. Doing it in all those cities was part of the work, you know. The first thing I did, usually, was figure out where the city hall was, where the public library was and just get to know the city and then go out and do it. [man] He doesn't want to reveal himself yet, so he develops this imaginary character. He becomes a private investigator, R. Dick Trace it. And he actually sets up an office on the East Coast when he gets here. [Hambleton] One of the names I was using, Mr. Reeee, 'cause that's what it became. It became a mystery. I really began to think I was murdering people. Going back to a hotel room covered in paint-- blood-- in blood-red paint. And it was-- Getting a cheap hotel room, putting maps of the city on the wall. Planning out where I was going to do it. My friends laid their bodies down. I traced over my friends. Made the front page of the San Francisco news. I made the news. That was part of the work. I wanted to make the news. It was part of the murder mystery. [Madsen] Playing with language. Playing with the media, you know. It was part of the work. [woman] It really caused a huge sensation in the art world and also amongst the police because they thought that it was actually a murder. [woman 2] They were wondering who was murdered, who was behind it, which got him in a lot of trouble. [Hambleton] I put up a wanted poster too. A fake FBI poster related to this. And the public wanted to know who did it. I was told I'd never get a grant again. [laughs] [man] The place to be, if you wanted to become a rich and famous artist, is New York. Just like any aspiring starlet had to go to Hollywood. It's all about being part of a scene, a club, going to all the openings, the art parties, schmoozing, networking, hanging out. [Hambleton] The first day I came to New York, I went to Club 57 'cause the director, Kai Eric, he introduced me to Jean-Michel Basquiat the first day I got here. And he was actually wearing a crown... just like in the movie. [man] He kind of came to New York with the strategies of a pretty serious conceptual artist. And like most of us, he became just enthralled by this god-awful mess that New York City was at that time. Pretty much immediately started to practice on the streets. [woman] My first exposure to Richard's work was a piece called I Only Have Eyes for You, which was this life-sized man, sort of in this Napoleonic stance, in funny, strange places. They would give me a start. I Only Have Eyes for Youwas this other piece I did, which started in 1980. This photo image of someone standing around the city. He's all dressed up and he doesn't know where he's going. There's a lot of people out there just waiting... maybe for you. "I only have eyes for you." [man] He's like one of the first artists to actually take an image of himself... put it on the street like that. [woman] It was done on blueprint paper so it would slowly fade over the course of three to six months. [man] And as the weather grabs them, they just wash out and turn into a ghost silhouette. This image is a life-size photo. It was 1980. I knew it was a new decade, and I knew things were going to be different. [woman] New York in the early '80s was a very different place than it is now. You have to remember that Times Square then was raunchy. There were prostitutes and drug dealers roaming the streets. [man] Simultaneously with that, in the East Village and Lower East Side was a totally different kind of scene. [woman] Well, it was like one big nonstop party. The rents were really cheap. New York was still the place where you could realize your creative dream. So it was kind of a mecca. [man] People that were there were primarily creative people that were there to make a statement about society, about art. I think it was the bad things about the Lower East Side scene that made it good. It was a cauldron of all kind of fiery energies. [woman] ♪ Dancing very close♪ ♪ Barely breathing♪ [man] It was kind of lawless. ♪ Almost comatose♪ The area was dangerous. But that was the trade-off. ♪ Wall to wall♪ ♪ People hypnotized♪ [man] They were willing to sacrifice to live in this area. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun. [woman] The East Village movement was about kids having fun and kids wanting to express themselves. You had CBGB's, David Byrne and the Talking Heads, Television, the Ramones. I mean it was amazing. [man] The best part about New York during the '80s is the nightlife. And Richard felt more connected to the night. He's a night animal. [Carter] In the summer of 1980, it was impossible to miss Richard's shadows. They were very scary and they were festooned on these walls sometimes where you would least expect them. The whole neighborhood had this kind of vibe of being very edgy, you know, and just, like, you didn't know where you were half the time. You'd come up onto one of these dark alleys or something and light up a cigarette or a joint, and then all of a sudden you see this huge, like, humongous shadow thing. That was very, very spooky indeed. [McCormick] This was a relatively unlit downtown. Very unpopulated and very dangerous. His art really captured the lurking. Super visceral, psychological effect. Those things scared the pants off of you. [Arcade] You don't experience it as an image. You experience it as an action. And the first time that it happened to me, I was completely freaked out. I thought somebody was gonna jump me. [Hambleton] The city is part of the picture. I don't paint the entire picture. I just simply add to the urban picture. I try to be aware of the psychological and sociological implications that a city has and the structure of the city, and just work with it and add to it. It's simply just adding to the picture. [man] For a long time, I wasn't aware of who had done these things. But the media kind of cultivated an image of this Shadowman. [Hambleton] If anything, I'm the shadow behind the black figure, you know. I've got New York covered. There's a security guard in every section of New York. And if they all came to life, then that could be a part of a horror movie. [laughs] Black figures wandering the streets. [woman] People would walk all over the city looking for these mysterious marks springing up everywhere. They were like precursors to Banksy. [man] No one did anything like that. Now there's this guy named Banksy who's taking the world by storm. Banksy has talked about how Richard Hambleton was an inspiration for his work. Banksy tries to get the audience to look at their surroundings in a different way. And you can see a direct connection to the way Richard Hambleton was doing that. [McCormick] At that time, graffiti was dominant. If you were an artist, if you cared about art, the fumes of the aerosol got everyone intoxicated. Everyone tried to grasp at the energy and potential of the city as an urban canvas. These people would be now considered the pioneers of what we call street art. There's a big difference between what's thought of as being graffiti art and what I do. Just because it's in a public place, I don't think it should be compared to graffiti and street art. [man] Richard always had that air of visiting royalty. "Yes, I'm painting on the street, but I'm painting on the street because of these grand ideas of art and how it should be accessed." [Patterson] Richard has always had arrogance and pride. He always felt that he was, like, a real establishment artist. Never was just a graffiti guy or anything like that. [man] He was different from everyone else. He was always kind of calm, cool, and collected, and a little bit reserved. I mean, he was already taking drugs, but he was in relative control of it. [man] Richard's a very likable guy. When you meet him, he's very well dressed. He wore a great suit, looked great. He's like a rock star. Something that always impressed me about him was he has the greatest sense of style in his clothes. To my sensibility, he should've been on the cover of GQ. [Arcade] I remember seeing Richard at openings with dark sunglasses, flowing cravat, suits, and girls. Richard likes girls. Richard likes girls a lot. [woman] He was kind of a little bit edgy, but he was sexy. He was attractive. He was definitely a presence. Women in general find Richard fascinating. He's enticing. He has a natural energy around him that just kind of draws you in. [man] What was it that was making these girls go for him? And they really did, and even now, Mette would do whatever she could for him. [man] Mette Madsen was his girlfriend, and she was beautiful and charming and normal and together. Which was a startling contrast to Richard Hambleton. Mette was his better half. [woman] The romance, I think, was there from the onset. And the whole experience was sort of romantic. I mean, the city at night, riding bicycles, lying in the park. One of our first dates, we went to Tompkins Square Park. We painted squirrels on the trees.Oh, the squirrels. Yeah. She was a painter. So black squirrels on the trees. That was pretty good. Shadow squirrels. [laughs] [Madsen] An evening would often just start out going to a nightclub or maybe seeing music. And actually, he's a pretty good dancer. And it always ended up with us walking around and getting some paint. As opposed to going out for dinner, you'd find yourself with a bucket of paint and dodging police. Richard was painting and I was helping carry some paint, and these police cars came out of nowhere. And we're standing there covered with paint, buckets of paint, brushes. And Richard disappears. He takes off. They had the guns pointed at me and they pulled me up by my hair. -No, it-- -One guy starts kicking me. She screams, "Stop!" Thank goodness you screamed. I was screaming, yelling--"He's my boyfriend." [laughs] [Madsen] It did not take long for us to evolve into a relationship. And then we saw each other all the time. I mean, every night for years. At that time he was intrigued with branding and the Marlboro man and his significance in the American landscape. This is a Marlboro man. What he is, he's an American hero. He's got the white hat. He's got the yellow trench coat like firemen. But actually, what he's doing, he's killing people. I mean, he's got Marlboro cigarettes. So I blackened him out. [McCormick] Richard's doing them in this, like, paint, which is like black tar. One of the associations I always brought was like, I like Marlboro, man. Is that what it's doing to my lungs? It was paradise found, paradise lost, paradise exploited by Marlboro. [Madsen] There was this whole mystique around the Marlboro man for him. That was really what drew him into those rodeo paintings. [Kostabi] When I got to New York, the three kingpins of the graffiti art world were Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Richard Hambleton. The International Herald Tribune did a one-page article on the boom in graffiti art in 1983, and Richard was the only artist in that article with an image of his art. Not Basquiat, not Haring. It says, "A Basquiat, you got to pay up to 10,000. If you want a Haring or a Hambleton, you gotta pay 15,000." Richard and Keith Haring probably had the biggest influence in terms of using urban space to make the whole city your canvas. I think that Basquiat and Richard and Haring are three of the best artists of their generation. -[Valmorbida] You draw these Shadowmen. -[Hambleton] Yeah. Around the city. And Basquiat would come over and draw a skull on top. But I love it when you get an interaction with this. [woman] The graffiti artists that are working on the street come inside and start making paintings for the inside, and the galleries start selling them. The East Village scene, so there was a couple places like Fun Gallery and Club 57, and that's where Keith Haring and Basquiat and me would hang out. The initial two years, there were six openings every night. Every storefront was a gallery. It was just like a big party. My name is Fab 5 Freddy. This is Rammellzee. We are generals in the urban army. [Hambleton] The two worlds started fusing. [woman] Andy Warhol, who was kind of a god of the time, said that pop art is taking the inside and putting it outside and taking the outside and putting it inside, which I think you could certainly apply to Basquiat and Haring, and of course, Richard Hambleton. [man] So now he's taken the same images that he would put on the street and he would make those into paintings. And that leads into, I think, a studio practice that for at least a decade was one of the most interesting, enthralling, ecstatic bodies of work coming out of New York at the time. [Hambleton] My paintings may look fast and spontaneous, but there's a lot of planning and premeditation that goes into it. I think my studio painting is evolving quite a lot. Much more than the outdoor work. [Arcade] Richard went from being a mystery to being immediately snapped up. I remember seeing this big spread about him in Lifemagazine like in a dentist's office, and you just thought, "Well, this is crazy." [Hambleton] Lifemagazine wanted to do a photo spread. I had this sort of planned out. I had the painting half finished. So the cameraman actually got covered in paint. Instead of throwing the paint at the canvas, I threw it at the camera. I put a bit of plastic over him. He didn't know what was going on. I set this up before he got there. [McCormick] I do remember that when I met Richard, he was kind of a famous artist because his work was omnipresent. So he was really up there in a big way. In the very beginning, in the late '70s and early '80s, it was not about money. We used to just drink Ballantine Ale all the time and just, you know, write. Just write stuff on the walls. There was no ambition in your--? No, there was really no ambition in it at all. [Arcade] But it quickly became about money. A lot of the people that collect art right now don't even care what it is. They don't even look at the thing. They only-- It's like an investment. It's like real estate. These artists who initially started expressing their talent on the street eventually got wider recognition, and then the art market tried to get in on the act. What's your last name, sweetheart?Basquiat. You could feel how some of that money of Wall Street was beginning to get into the art market and promoting some of these street artists. [Cembalest] What happened is that it was a time when uptown was coming downtown and downtown was going uptown. And collectors did become interested. And you did start to see limousines start rolling through. People did start spending money on contemporary art. It became an international commodity. It became a symbol of a certain kind of taste to have art. You would think, to look at this respectable, conservative English dowager duchess, that I would not like it. But I love it. [man] So by this time you're starting to now get into the money. The big money. [Hoban] Commodification of art went hand in hand with the bull market on Wall Street. This resulted in less creativity, more branding and more people getting into art for all the wrong reasons: to buy it and flip it, to become instantly famous. Somebody like Richard, that wasn't part of his reason for making art and he didn't really participate in that. [Hambleton] When I did the shadows, I wasn't interested in the media at all. That wasn't worked into the work. I just wanted to focus on painting. A quote by da Vinci. [Valmorbida] So virtually, with all this press and every single magazine, you name it, all over the world, you were one of the most celebrated artists in the world. But I didn't have a gallery, and I was hoping someone would knock on my door. But they did, and you said no to everybody. No, I never said no to anybody. I just wasn't home. [laughs] All right. [Woodward] The biggest dealers in the '80s wanted Richard. Everybody was trying to get a piece of him. They wanted him, and they thought they could capture him. Nope. He's hard to open up. He's very private. [man] Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat connected with the Warhol scene. It's not enough to be a great artist. You have to be part of the scene socially. As superficial as that may sound, as icky as that may sound. Richard Hambleton didn't overlap that social scene. [McCormick] He was not trusting towards the gallery system. He's coming from a place where the art object is a little suspect and the people who sell it are deeply suspect. [Hambleton] I should have taken care of business. I had assistants telling me, "Richard, why don't you try to take care of business?" But I got trapped up in a world of insanity. [man] Richard, in a way, was his own worst enemy. I think in order to run with that fashionable society, you have to be able to play a certain game. At least be able to feign some clearheadedness. It's common knowledge that Richard had a problem with drugs. [man] It was drugs that were making him that way. And he became more trouble than he was worth. In the midst of becoming the most important thing in New York with Basquiat, with Keith, he leaves. [woman singing opera] [Madsen] There was a few years there where we seemed to be constantly traveling. He was showing extensively at that point, so he would use the show as a way to get to the city, to also then expand his street work. In Europe they looked great 'cause of all those little alleyways. This is Venice. You could not go to western Europe without seeing a shadow. This is Milano.That's in Milano? Yeah, this is in the back of a church. [Woodward] Paris, Rome, all the hot spots. Even goes to the Middle East. Eventually winds up in Japan and stays over a year and a half. He's just an American artist transient, traveling the world, but he's always doing art. I hung out with some friends in Berlin, and the Checkpoint Charlie Museum heard that I was in town and they offered me a few thousand dollars to do something on the wall, anything I wanted. They said, "If you get arrested by the East German police, there's nothing we can do for you." I just painted a bunch of shadows on the wall. [siren wailing] [Carter] This was kind of at the height of his art world popularity. And Richard had the celebrity and access to a fair amount of money, which did fuel his incipient drug habit. But Hambleton is totally a guy that's on his own wavelength. All of a sudden, he just started painting a totally different kind of scene. [woman] He started to work on landscapes, using silver leaf and all sorts of gorgeous, gorgeous materials. But the art world didn't want that. The art world in the '80s still wanted Richard's shadow figures. He didn't care what the art world wanted from him. He, as an artist, said, "This is where I'm moving, this is what I'm going to do." [Hoban] Does the artist make more pictures that look the same as the ones that sold for 20 grand? Or does the artist experiment into a new thing that people might not like? [Hambleton] You start with a horizon line. Once you have the horizon line, anything you do becomes a landscape. You can't make a mistake, and there's a spontaneity involved here. It's a beautiful painting. It was part of my personal evolution, but also I wanted to do something that had a different sensibility. And it was romantic. As I said, it's not about landscape. It's about love. [woman] If Richard Hambleton chose to move from the sort of more edgy, more expressionistic work he was doing on the street to something that was more academically beautiful, along the lines of Turner, it would be tantamount to career suicide. That's not what people were looking for. For whatever reason, he turned his back on the art world. It just wasn't his thing. I mean, he wasn't a careerist. [McCormick] People thought it was kitsch. I mean, "beautiful" was like such a derogatory term. It's like, "You're working with beauty? God, we did that for a couple centuries. We're over that now." I could've made a million dollars just selling shadow heads. But I went from one shadow to a flashy shadow head to a seascape. A collector would want something and I wasn't doing it anymore. [McCormick] Richard, at this time, starts going even more into the painterly aspects of representation. Specifically, the seascapes he started doing. Monumentally huge. They were, like, all subsuming. [Hambleton] I never studied landscapes or seascapes. You know, I just had this idea, I'm gonna paint a large wave painting. The first one I did was like 24 feet, and it was beautiful. The wave is coming right at you. You stand in front of it, and there's this wave coming. [McCormick] If you stood in front of one, it was the sublime. It was like what Turner was after. The sublime's not about beauty. It's a little bit about fear, right? It's the awesome face of God that if you look at for too long, you'll be blinded. This kind of ferocious, but gloriously beautiful power. And I wouldn't separate this from his drug intake. He was really interested in Ecstasy at that time. And then of course, drug addictions shift, and then it became about crack and heroin, but it was still about this kind of loss of self. Before, Richard's this really slick guy, eating in nice restaurants, super well-dressed, hottest girlfriends in New York. As Richard begins to lose himself... and he really does. I mean, it's not that long before he's living on the street. It was like pretty much a free fall. But that's embedded in the art. This insane ego death. This is one of the most narcissistic, ambitious, ego-driven guys out there. And it just washed away in this tidal wave of these seascapes. [Librizzi] The drug revolution affected everybody, and Richard became part of that and he embraced that and for some reason he felt it brought him where he could work best. And strangely enough, it worked. [Madsen] That is sort of right around when Richard and I lost touch with each other. That's when the drugs became an issue. [man] Drugs and art were inextricably intertwined with the New York art scene of the '80s. Especially the East Village or the Lower East Side. [Hell] There were whole square blocks that were basically a drug bazaar. There'd be long lines leading to the front door of some burnt-out apartment in a building where you'd slide, like, however many bills under the door and they would slide back glassine envelopes of drugs. [man] They would lower a bucket on a rope and you would put your money in the bucket and then they would haul it back up and put your drugs in it. There's a small handful of people that are still left over from that era that didn't die. And there's sure a big list of people that did die, eh? [Woodward] It was really a kind of-- something out of Charles Dickens. Drugs were sort of the least of it. Yeah, the prostitution and the murder and all that stuff was commonplace. [bell ringing] I would say between the crash... and the Tompkins Square Riots that occurred at the end of the '80s for the whole East Village art movement, that was it. I mean, it was a very short-lived period. What, six years? But yet it was the center of the art world. The major thing though, all those factors aside, was AIDS. The American artist Keith Haring has died as a result of AIDS. He was 31. [McCormick] When you start going from parties every night to funerals every week, it really changes it. You can't underestimate what it means to a community to lose the best third of its population. [Hoban] Both Basquiat and Haring, without meaning to sound as cynical as this sounds, they made a very good career move. They died. As soon as you die, it means there's not going to be any more work, and therefore your work soars. [man] So we move to The Dust Heads, the Basquiat, the 1982 work. Sold at $43,500,000. [applause] [man] One reason why Richard never got the kind of appreciation that Haring or Basquiat got is because he didn't die. We're all different. [woman] We know a couple other art dealers down in the Village, and if we may talk to them every three or four months, it's really regrettable. One of the first questions they'll ask is, "Do you know if Richard's still alive?" That's such a horrible question. [Librizzi] I was in the East Village and this guy approached me. He asked me if I wanted to buy a little painting. I think he wanted a hundred dollars or something for it. I just thought, "This is a New York junkie." After looking at him a while, it occurred to me that it was Richard. [Poticha] We heard stories that he would ride his bicycle through the Village and he would give a painting to a restaurant owner, and they would buy him dinner 'cause he couldn't afford it. I had documented a lot of drugs and things on that part of the Lower East Side, and Richard's part of that. So I documented some of the places where he was. He would be in there with his girlfriend and she would be covered in blood. [laughs] I mean, it was a mess. It was this revolving door of artists and drug addicts. And then eventually, I moved in. I describe it as a living crime scene. [Hambleton] [woman] [Hambleton] [Librizzi] He was living in his little room with a girlfriend and a prostitute. He doesn't get sleep. He doesn't eat. And he takes massive amounts of drugs, where he would make Basquiat look like a Boy Scout. Whenever Richard did, in his mind, a decent sale, he would go to-- I think it was Russ and Daughters. And he would buy caviar. I always thought that was really funny. 'Cause he'd come into the junkie house on Orchard Street with blood everywhere. I'd be sitting there on the table, shooting up in my leg. And Richard would walk in with, like, caviar and, like, a couple bundles of dope. I mean, it was just so surreal. [Arcade] How did Richard go from this high-flying career that anybody in their right mind would have wanted to protect-- four-star hotels, beautiful women on his arm, tons of money-- and then becoming a complete and utter junkie? I don't think it's something that can be articulated, but if one would say anything, one would say that Richard had to follow his muse. And Richard's muse is a cracked-out junkie ho. [Hanavan] No matter what his circumstance, Richard was always painting. I had never really seen somebody who was so deep in their addiction being able to create in that way with that intensity. I was working the streets at the time and it was a rough time for me. And we became really close. It was fascinating and exciting and tragic all at the same time. And I always felt that Richard's painting was what kept him sane. He would use everything. If he didn't have paint, he would use blood. [man] Really? So what are they about? [Patterson] When you boot your heroin, when you first pull it in, and the blood starts coming into the syringe, you have this sort of beautiful string landscape, which is made by the blood as it gets pulled into the hypodermic. So then the question becomes, are those beautiful paintings, the one with the gold and the blood, are those really the landscapes of the inside of the hypodermic needle, and that's his vision, that's his life, that's his aesthetic, that's what he's drenched in? [man] You got bashed in the nose. Oh, somebody was trying to mug you.Yeah. Somebody thought you bought a bundle.Right. [Hambleton] [woman] Living at the gas station was a real low point. [Hawkins] That gas station was just so bizarre. Why would someone want to even go in there, let alone live there? I didn't want to go in there and see if he was home. You know. [man] I don't know how he was able to stay in that space and sleep in that space with the rats running around openly. [woman] Because it was an old garage, there was much more space for Richard to work. And he was creating some of the most amazing things. [Arcade] In this completely chaotic, unheated gas station, he was making beautiful paintings now. So there at one of the bleakest periods in his life... where did he go? He went into beauty. [man] But property is worth money, so, as time went on, the people that owned it realized they had to get him out. [Hambleton] Once again I was thrown out in the street. And just like that, I didn't have time to prepare to do anything. Situations like that happened all the time. Richard was selling artwork to us. And we just started collecting to a tremendous extent. We knew that he lived in his storage room. And we were crawling around one of these storage rooms one time, and he handed me this Tupperware container, and I said, "What's this?" And he said, "That's my urine from the other night." "Okay." He needed a place to live... and work. And we did rent out a place, but it was impossible. We gave him thousands in a week. I mean, couldn't you live on 4,000, 5,000 cash a week? I could. There was no reason for this. Whatever money he earned, he spent. Whether it be on women or drugs or art supplies. It'd be endless to iterate all the fuck-ups Richard's done. But they're not entirely all his fault. He had some bad luck with some dealers. When he got ripped off, he decided he didn't want to show. People would take advantage of him left and right, especially when he was kind of coming out of that connection to the art world. People knew that Richard was desperate. People knew that he wasn't being represented anymore. There is some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy of Richard getting in bed with the wrong people. He was, I believe, near death when I first met him. He was by himself. He was sort of a side note at that time. Selling his art for nothing to anyone who would buy it. I really felt bad for him, so I picked him up. I became his friend, his mentor. Richard continued to come to my studio space from 1992 to 2001 after the World Trade Center collapsed. He came to my space three to five days a week and worked continuously. I would commission him to do each piece, so I would have a contract for every single piece. So Richard would come in. He wouldn't get the money until he finished the piece. It was a very controlled situation. [Madsen] I think Richard found himself, at times, in desperate need of money. And unfortunately, when certain people became aware of that, he was grossly taken advantage of. He had a huge art collection. So he was always behind on his rent at his storage space. So I would help him with the storage space bills, and I ended up with seven Keith Haring subway chalk drawings... four or five Jean-Michel's works. And the amount of work that I had, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, the largest collector in the world of Richard's paintings. When the economy tanked in 2008, I was forced to sell off a large portion of his collection. Bruce Willis and Mick Jagger and everybody else owns his work now. It all came from my studio. [Madsen] He lent Richard space to maybe make work with the understanding that if these pieces were to be sold in the future, the monies would be split. That ended up completely backfiring. [Murphy] We were like brothers, and I had told him at the time that, you know, if it was to be resold, then we would maybe be able to work something out, which never came out, never came to be, you know, with the way the economy tanked and me losing contact with Richard and that whole thing. But he signed a contract for every piece, so I own the artwork. [Madsen] People did more or less steal from him, or certainly did not live up to their end of the bargain, and that's very sad. The net result is he's become, uh, not really bitter, but there's a distrust there. [Murphy] After I lost contact with Richard in about 2004, the Woodwards picked up Richard and they helped him along for a number of years. One day I asked myself, "Who's left?" Who's still around from my world of the '80s? I come from the '80s. God, Richard Hambleton. Where the hell is he? Then I started to call Richard, and call him, and call him-- [line ringing]and leave messages and call him. I called him 44 times. Hi, I'm glad you called. Leave a message and I'll call you back later. [Woodward] Richard was in a very crammed storage closet in a basement of the building. And it was very dark, and there he was. It was like something out of a movie. The light was at his back, so when you came in, you could only see him as a shadow. I'm standing there looking at this, going, "Is this a movie? Or is this reality?" You see the work, you're drawn to it. It's almost like you're seduced, right? You want to naturally help this guy. Richard's art is doing its magic. ♪ Let them talk♪ ♪ If they want to♪ Richard Hambleton. Um, let's tell people where they can see this artwork. Where's the gallery, the John Woodward Gallery located? 133 Eldridge Street. And it will be there for another--? We're there just for one more week. It ends this week. So we hope everybody can come down and check it out. It's quite a remarkable show. Richard, what's next for you? Richard Hambleton, the great artist who's-- We're so happy to have you. It's a great honor to have you here on Let Them Talk. I just want to continue. Yo, Vlad, come look at this. He's got all these bikes and shit. I don't know what he's trying to-- Then this wall. He built it because he thought he was going to do an art show. An art show inside.Yeah, a group show. So he built all these walls. [Nemo Librizzi] The best thing I can say that happened for Richard was when we introduced him to Vlad and Andy. We went down to Richard's studio, and it was love at first sight. I made it with those Basquiats. [Nemo] When Andy walked in, he just got it. He just looked at it, said, "Man this is amazing. This is the most beautiful undiscovered artist." When I first met him, I go, "Nemo, he's going to be dead in a week." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, that's what everyone's been saying for 20 years." You good? Hey, you look well. It's like fallen off, right? So what did the doctor say? [Woodward] Richard has cancer, severe scoliosis, and he's not going to go in and have surgery, you know. He's afraid. He just copes with that physical deformity. It doesn't seem to impede his work. Most people would be afraid of Richard when they see him for the first time. But Andy and I had the idea to put on a show for him. Instead of just putting on a show for a young artist, we had the opportunity to revive someone. We were able to revive a ghost. I was so fascinated, I dropped every other project I was working on and made it my business to find where his inventory was, who was involved with him, his history. I was like, "Hold on. This is too good to be true." [Woodward] Andy and Vlad immediately recognized Richard's work as something very important and untapped. It was there for the taking. We said, "Look, we'll do New York, 2009 September fashion week." Richard's first show. [cheering, applauding] We both knew that Mr. Armani would be someone that would really enjoy the black-and-white style of the works, and we knew that Mr. Armani was someone that had actually a good knowledge of the '80s and the '80s art scene. We call him up, and they just decided to sponsor the first show in New York. [Valmorbida] I didn't want to be known as an art dealer. I didn't want to be associated with being in a gallery. I just wanted to do projects in a way that I really believed in. Richard was one project that I set out to go, "This has to be told." [knocking]This could be them. This is CNN. Hello. [woman] Hi. Richard? Hi. Nice to see you. Well, I wanted to start, Richard, with some of the paintings that you are first well-known for, what you call your public art. Yeah. And this murder series, Mass Murder. Did somebody actually get killed there or no? Someone's inside there. Somebody's inside there? What do you mean? Yeah.Actually? No.Okay. [laughs] [line ringing] I spent 12 months on the phone, all day, every day, traveling the world, finding every Richard Hambleton I could. He calls us every three, four months. "Don't you want to sell? Don't--" He's offered us nearly 200,000 for that. He found people in New York, but also people in Jersey, and people in Colorado, and people in Florida that had collected Richard's works in the '80s and the '90s. I met Vlad and Andy and I showed them art and sold, you know, the large body of paintings to them. [Valmorbida] We were lucky enough to come across some vast collections of other people's works, but 90 percent of our energy went into visiting Richard to make sure he was painting. Richard! Richard? Richard. Hey, Richard. Well, when you commit to Giorgio Armani himself, you expect the artist to give you a few paintings, no? [woman] ♪ One way or another♪ ♪ I'm gonna find ya I'm gonna get ya, get ya Get ya, get ya♪ ♪ One way or another I'm gonna win ya♪ ♪ I'm gonna get ya Get ya, get ya, get ya♪ Richard, I've been here 30 minutes! It's fucking cold, dude. ♪ One day, maybe next week♪ We've been trying to get some work out of him for two months. Richard? Hey, man. How are you doing? Good?No, I'm not good. [coughing] [Madsen] I actually had not heard from Richard in ages and got a phone call out of the blue if I would come over and help with these two guys-- I'm doing a series of rodeos. ...who were coming to his studio to look at work. I finally got the position of this guy just right. And I said, "Yes, happily." And that's when I first met Andy and Vladimir. [man] She really cared about Richard. It always seemed like a really tender relationship that they had. They really loved and respected each other. If he had problems, she would try to help. You should come back on Sunday. Sunday's our day.That's a good day. Yeah, we always come back, and you say the same thing every Sunday. There was always pressure with time and people worrying about, is it going to be done? It's been a part of the relationships he's had with galleries from the beginning. He would make an appointment for someone to come to the studio, and at the time, there would be something to show, and then he gets back in there and has to repaint the thing because he's made one adjustment which then requires yet another adjustment over here. And then nothing ever really gets finished. To me, this is virtually done. This needs to be changed just a bit. -This is too much now. Come on. -Don't worry. Yeah, no, don't worry. There's no show if there's no art. Don't worry. I am dying to finish these. If you're dying to finish them, finish them. Part of me understands to try to work with that kind of pressure is very, very difficult. And this every-other-day thing is really getting crazy. You want $2,500 a week? Finish paintings, man. I'm into my fourth Sunday.Okay, all I'm saying-- -For the same ones still set up. -That's insane! [Madsen] At a certain point, it's not that difficult to discern, okay, when Richard says two weeks, this is a flexible number. It shouldn't be, but it is. And that did start to create a lot of mistrust and anger. I'm not leaving here without something tonight because I gave you the money, and that's always the deal. That's not the deal. I'm taking the art away. Excuse me. I can't do it. -I'm messing this up. -No, don't. [Madsen] Let's leave you alone, Richard. Let's leave. He's gonna fuck it up. [Madsen] It would become very frustrating, being called in to help and see the opportunity that was being presented, yet Richard just repainting these paintings. Thanks for coming over. I think those guys liked my work. Yeah, they did.It's fucking insane. [Hanavan] Richard would talk about the art world, and there was a lot of complaining. Of course, at the time, I would think, you know, "Yeah, those motherfuckers, yeah. Richard, that's terrible. How dare they treat you like that?" But after I got clean, many years looking back, and still dealing with Richard, I thought, "Well, I don't really know where the truth lies." I mean, Richard did a lot of fucked-up things, you know? Addicts in general become very difficult to even talk to, let alone work with. So, I don't know. According to Richard everyone takes advantage of him. Nobody's ever done right by Richard, according to Richard. And he slanders all of them to me, and I'm sure he slanders me to them. [Woodward] When you least expect it, and you have some sort of agreement with this guy, something completely different will happen. And you feel betrayed. Regardless of who you are in the world and how much you give this guy... he's going to get you. He's going to upset you. He's going to make you so angry that you swear to God you will never speak to him again. Richard? Hey, Richard. -Don't be surprised. -Dude, you don't understand. When you're doing a half a million dollar art show, you need art. I can't seem to have focus, like, maintain a focus for longer than a few seconds. We had everyone saying, "Richard, this is your art show of your career. You have to make art." We could not get him to make a painting, and every great painting that we saw, when we come to collect it, he would then throw paint and destroy it. It was just like, "Richard, what are you doing?" Don't push me so much. It's insane.I'm not pushing you. I wanna do it. I'm dying to... Let's talk about something else, okay? People writing a check for 500 grand to do your show wanna see something for it, and they're not getting shit. They're getting-- They're getting-- They're getting 30 years of my life too. Often there will be a painting, but he's not ready to let it be seen. And he will repaint and repaint and repaint. You painted over it. Oh, my God, you painted over it. I'm telling you that you're accusing me of something that's not true. -You ruined it again. -It wasn't finished at all. Richard, I swear to God, man, you're scaring me. It wasn't finished at all. If I don't show the people in Europe that something's on the way, they're not going to give us a check for you and they're going to go on to the next project because you're not the only thing in the world, Richard. I don't think I am, but honestly I'm--You're acting like that. No, I'm not. I'm tired right now.You're acting like you're too-- like a wackado. It's like, do you want to be on the street and broke? They're asking me every day, "Where's the stuff from Richard's studio?" I'm never bringing it, and I look like a fucking idiot every time I leave the studio. I feel like a fucking idiot when you come here too. I feel worse than you do. I do. I feel worse than you do. It's not a contest who feels worse--I feel worse, and I look worse. It doesn't matter.I'm not eating. I'm not sleeping. Really, at the end of the day, it did have to do with not wanting to release a painting until he felt it was ready to leave the studio. And his idea of when something is finished and everybody else's often did not mesh. I can't give it to you right now. We've got nothing to show the sponsors. Andy, I don't want to fight with you. I'm really tired. Okay, please! You painted over everything that was finished, Richard! -That wasn't finished, Andy. -This is not normal. I'm scared. We'll be ahead of time by the end of this week, believe me. We'll be ahead of time. This work isn't-- It's conceptual. My brain is going to fall apart if I don't get it out. We've been waiting for months for him. You know, let's cross our fingers. Ah, Richard! So glad to see us?Yeah. Hey, Richard, this one is incredible. This is done. Almost. Almost. This one is finished. -That's a good one, huh? -Incredible. Yeah, nice pose. -I'm really happy with this one. -These are going to be amazing. Oh, yeah. You can't see it, but there's-- Yeah, the hard part's done. You've just got to finish it off, right? Hey, Richard, we finally got here. Yeah.Six weeks later. I know.That's good though, right? It's gonna be good.Everything good takes time. I know I'm annoying, but watch the result we get. Do you understand? -We're gonna work together. -This is sick. This is a good one. On the first show we did in 2009, we had people begging, fighting over paintings. Sold 24 paintings. 4,000 people throughout the night. It was such a success. [Woodward] Did it have a major effect on Richard's career? You bet. It pushed him through the roof. [Valmorbida] Everyone from Mary J. Blige, Russell Simmons, Alicia Keys, to every sort of actor, actress, musician, hedge fund, politicians. Yeah, we sold paintings for 400,000 for Richard. [Roitfeld] Obviously, working with the Armani team brought something else. When they actually put together their PR machine, they're very, very strong. All these elements mixed together just brought the most exciting crowd I had ever seen at an art show before. [Valmorbida] Were you surprised at the reaction that everyone had and the press and the world, sort of how they covered that show? Yeah, yeah, it was brilliant. It was huge! [Librizzi] They were very successful with him, and they put his prices into another range because they had the clientele and they had the worldwide reach. [Hambleton] It was like a dream. I was like, "Wow, you know, it's finally getting somewhere." [Roitfeld] AMFAR is the American Foundation for AIDS Research, and it's the biggest dinner of the week in Cannes during the festival. Every year they choose one artist, and Richard was picked in 2010. I had no idea what to expect, you know, how well it would do. It's your bid, sir! And I started, and the bids started coming from everywhere. Warmest congratulations! Well done! Sold! Well done! At 400,000 euros. [Roitfeld] The room went crazy, and then they came up to us and asked us if we wanted to donate a second one because they were raising so much money. And we gave them another piece. They were auctioning other artists that night, and they were going for $50,000, $60,000, $70,000. Two Richard Hambletons went for basically a million bucks. [man] The high point for me anyway was the Phillips exhibit. [Valmorbida] There were over 5,000 people, you know. Front cover International Herald Tribune, New York Timesfeatures on the show. [De Pury] With Vlad and Andy, you had an amazing mix of gorgeous women and people from show biz, from the fashion world, a fun mix of people. [Valmorbida] He turned up at the very end. I've never seen a reaction, like a superstar walked in the room. I've been to many art shows. I've never seen a reaction of people when they encountered Richard Hambleton walking in. [De Pury] I believe that Andy and Vlad were very happy with the outcome of the exhibition. They are both very good salespeople. And I think that they sold, you know, a fair amount of works. [Madsen] Andy and Vladimir did reintroduce him. All of a sudden, he was again in the world, in a way. And people began to reconsider his work, which is all good. But there was a sadness about it. Andy and Vladimir tend to travel in very glamorous circles, and all these sort of models and this glamorous crowd, and here is Richard. It made him feel very good that he's back in some sort of spotlight, but at the same time difficult. It just sort of accentuated this distance between where he is and where the pieces are going. He's been at these points before, never really seeing that the work gave him access to maybe this or that, or that it could be a vehicle for something else. The buck kind of just stopped there. At the end of the day, it really was just about the work. [Orias] So many people offered to help him. Major promoters. But he's such a-- he's very difficult. He doesn't like to give his best things. [Nemo] I brought a rich guy there one time to buy artwork. And the guy says, "Oh, yeah, I love that work right there. I want that work." Richard said, "No, no. That one's not for sale." I said, "Richard, come on. This guy's got money right now. He's gonna leave town. What are you doing?" "No, no, no, no. I don't wanna sell that one." [Orias] All his works, his major works, he did not want to sell. He would get rid of the things that were minor to him. But the major works, no. The more money that was going into those shows and the more famous Richard was becoming again, the harder it became for us to actually get the works from him. Over the three years that I've worked with him, and from his friends like Mette witnessing what I've actually given him, I think he was making a million bucks a year out of his studio, cash. Blowing every single cent of it. Every time we go in, "I need another 5,000. I need another 10,000," telling you every day he's broke. I was a little bit afraid of Richard. I had some moments with him in the studio where Andy and I actually ran away a couple of times because he was too crazy. Then all the drug dealers would turn up, some bad ones. They'd be, "I heard you've got some money for Richard." I'd say, "No, I don't." When there was confrontation, it got really bad sometimes. We had good moments, but towards the end it just became too difficult. [Valmorbida] The lies and the lies and the lies. I was just burnt out. I just knew that was the end. He knew it was the end. And since then, yeah, I've had very little contact with him. What seems like a mistake to the people around Richard who want him to be a great, known painter and want him to sell work because they also want to make money and want him to participate, you know, in the art world to be, perhaps, in his last months or years, an esteemed painter-- Maybe that doesn't fit in with Richard's idea for himself. [Woodward] He had the studio on Orchard, and he fell behind in his rent, and the notices were put on the door, but Richard wasn't paying attention to any of that, and he was evicted. [Poticha] He was a homeless man at this point, and so we had told him not to worry. We would make arrangements for him to stay in a hotel. And that started a cycle that lasted many, many months. I think that this tension has made my cancer speed up. My face is really rotting away. [Woodward] Is he riding on borrowed time? I don't know. I could say the same thing three years ago. He just keeps going. [Kristine Woodward] By some luck, a very lovely man walked into the gallery. I said, "I'm from Moscow, and I heard of Richard Hambleton." And she taught me Richard's story of his life, art, his paintings, everything. And all of a sudden, you know, I became so interested. At a certain stage she said, "We take care of him, and he has no place to live." I said, "Look, I might have a solution." [Kristine] Do you have something ready? Let's ask that question. It's a good question? You're not sure if you have something ready? I told Michael that we were getting the painting today at two o'clock. He's been so gracious to keep the accommodations available for you. And, you know, really, I'm embarrassed. I know that your paintings sell for a lot of money, but you know that the Trump for a month is like $20,000 to $40,000. -[Kristine] Can we have it before 6:00? -[Hambleton] Yeah, yeah. If I can get into the Trump, it would be nice. That's all I want for you. I want you to be able to relax. What am I doing? Whoops. Thank God! Oh, yeah. Triple. I like the red. Wow! That's popping.You did good. Good job! Good job.Good job, Richard. [Patterson] If you look at Richard as having burned all these bridges, in the end you could say he hasn't burned any bridges 'cause he continues to do what it was he's always been doing, just being totally committed to art and art only. And he's also somebody who you can kick in the face and he'll get right back up, which is pretty heroic. With Richard, it was always about the work. He just constantly was painting and letting that represent him. [Arcade] It's not going to be any kind of simple math and you're gonna get an even number at the end. We don't understand Caravaggio. We don't understand Van Gogh. We just don't understand them. [Librizzi] Van Gogh would go deeper. And that's the same thing that you feel with Richard. He's on the edge of a precipice, and he might not make it. [Arcade] Richard is one of the very few artists who has not allowed the market to creep into his work. He's dirty and rocky and shabby and elegant and doesn't make any sense. He colored outside the lines the whole time. Most people, at some point, would go, "I can't do this anymore." But Richard is on the hero's journey, and he's riding that black steed all the way. He's just holding on to the hair, and it's just him and that. And there's nothing else.
