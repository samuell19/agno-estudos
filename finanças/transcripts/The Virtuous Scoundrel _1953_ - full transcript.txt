Subtiltes by Crutch. The Life of an Honest Man A New Film from: The music is by: Directed by the screenwriter, with his voice-over. This film was shot in sets by Aimé Bazin, in Studio Photosonor. The sound recording is by Western, the film printing was made at C.T.M. Laboratories. The screenplay will be published at Raoul Solar Editions. With their cameras, René Ribaud and Pierre Bachelet recorded the images, while Tony Leenhardt, the engineer, taped the sounds. Then, Raymond Lamy edited the film. No one could do it better. And we can boast to have had Jean Bachelet as our Director of Photography The A.D was François Gir, the one who wrote everything on set was Odette Lemarchand, and the stage manager was Philippe Senne. The name of the production manager is Simon Barstoff, and, at last, our cast! Michel Simon, to save us money,. do you want to do two roles in this movie? With great pleasure. Then, we will admire you twice as much. Hello? You will be the wife of Michel Simon in this film. Would you be free tomorrow afternoon? I'm looking forward to see you. Pauline Carton, you must be on the shooting set at 2:00 pm. Standing in a black dress and a wool coat. - Do you need me to bring anything else? - Yes, your talent. ...and some skillful extras. During the movie, Mouloudji sings a brand new song. AND Lana Marconi, I'm sorry to say that in this film, you play a "woman of the night". I can take it. Then let's get started. You call this spinach? What is the problem? This is inedible because it's burnt. And I still have to pay for it. When you spoil a plate, you're not just a bad cook but also a dishonest woman. Working for a rich man doesn't allow you to spend his money without rhyme or reason. I know very well what happens behind my back. When you're talking about me... I know exactly what you think: "With his fortune, he can afford..." Well, my fortune was won by my hard work, one coin after the other, never stealing from anyone. I am an honest man! When I was 20 years old, if I did something like this in my work, something like what you did tonight with spinach, maybe today I wouldn't have 5 house employees and 2 cars. Think about it. Smoking at the dinner table? Where do you think you are? I'm sorry you haven't heard what I told Marie. - Well, we heard you yell from here. - I think the lesson was understood. Evelyn, pour the drinks. Mr. Albert Ménard-Lacoste, industrialist with an enormous fortune, who earned the “Legion d'Honneur”, was in his rights to call himself the most honest man in the world... and he did freely. This negative quality, because it consists of not behaving badly, this quality freed him of all the others that make a man pleasant to live and be with. If you study him, there is a quotation from Joseph de Maistre that will come to mind: The quotation is: "I don't know what the life of a villain is, I was not a villain, but the life of an honest man is awful." We apologize for this interruption. due to a technical problem. Mr. Albert Ménard-Lacoste had the privilege to see as real, in his mind the cruel or loony thoughts that were going through his head. His son, whom he saw as a fool. His daughter, and her turned-up nose, fixed like wax. The maid, because she is young and beautiful, he saw her coming to him almost naked. Later at night when his wife will be asleep, he will look at her for a long, long time... until he can see her, dead. But, one day, this happened... What's the trouble? It's for... It's about the gentleman that looks a lot like you, he brought a letter and now he wants to have the answer. Tell him I haven't had time yet. Tomorrow I will write him a letter. - He won't agree to that. - For what reason? He wants to be received as soon as possible, because he wants an immediate answer. I think he will not give up. Be kind to people, and they walk over you every time... Alright, let him in. And tell my wife and children I'm busy. Do you still recognize me? Or rather, do you recognize yourself? Of course, I recognize you, as myself indeed. You are as my photograph. - Hello Albert. - Hello Alain. Can we shake hands? Actually, I think we can't. We've never liked each other. We've been estranged for 30 years, and you let me in halfheartedly. I don't like feeling like a nuisance, but am I allowed to sit down? So that we must finally talk. - Have you read my letter? - Yes. - Is it possible then? - Unfortunately not. Can't you give me a job in your businesses? - Just because we look alike? - Not just for that. You clearly understand that I don't have a penny left, do you? Can't you recommend me to someone? I can do that, but is it honest to do so? To recommend someone unqualified can end very badly. - By the way, what is your profession? - I've done everything. Those are not references. So, shall I jump into the water? You have to see the disrespect in your look and your half-smile. And that relentless tone. - You hate me. - Absolutely not. - Do you feel sorry for me? - I admit it. But... I don't like that you think someone else is responsible for your problems. Nobody owes you anything, my friend, and your silent entitlement doesn't help your case. - How long have you been in Paris? - For 6 days. I live in a hotel next to Gare Du Nord. I recommend it. By the way, my letter says the address of the hotel. But I suppose you already threw it in the fireplace, huh? - Did you throw it into the fire? - No. You're a liar! Have you become an autographs collector? You hid my letter well. - So you were in Canada? - That's how it is. - What did you do there? - I was in jail. Wandering. Not having food or a place to sleep, they call it that now. In all civilized countries. You're looking at my suit do you like it? It was a gift from a stranger on the ship With 4 dollars that he pretended to forget in the pocket. There are weird people, right? And he wasn't my brother, isn't it? You think you're smart with this allusion, but you tell the truth: he was not your brother. Lucky for him. - Are you married? - No. I had a lover but fortunately she left me. Even with such nice clothes I can't even be your secretary? - Is it because of your wife? - That too. - She knows you have a brother, right? - No. You disappeared, you could as well never come back and revealing you meant revealing a lot of your antics that are none of her business. You were ashamed of me. Not exactly, but it goes without saying that a man of my stature wouldn't boast to have... A poor brother So your wife doesn't know that you have a twin brother? She knows that our mother gave birth to twins. - Oh, and one died! - That's how it is. So not only you didn't help me to live, but you've also killed me. What a brother! Out of curiosity, when have I died? - When you were 18 years old. - So young... So you disposed of me very quickly. Now I understand why you can't hire me as a secretary. Or recommend me. Give me 1,000 francs, would you? 1,000 francs? You can't refuse, right? What is 1,000 francs to you? - Well, the same as for you. - I can eat for 6 days with it. With 1000 francs I can smoke for a week. Why should I not smoke for a week because you failed to earn your own money? 3,000 francs, for me? 1,000 that I ask you, 1,000 to remain silent, and 1,000 probably so that I don't come back. To look so similar , and to be so different from one another. That's scary but, whatever, I'm your brother. You said it: you are my brother? Whatever! I also have my problems: my own family, my situation. And yourself. Yes indeed! You can't expect to be more important to me than me. I thought the family... Of course, the family... - It's something, isn't it? A family. - Yes of course... So that they abuse you. For me the real family is the one I have made myself. My wife and children... One chooses the wife and the children came naturally. But my father, my mother, my brother, my cousins and the rest... I did not choose them. Imagine your children thinking of you like that. I'm pretty sure that they will too when they have children of their own. - So you feel that way about me? - Yes, of course. I would have never chosen you as a brother. I would never think to befriend someone like you. When would we have even met if you hadn't been my brother? Probably never, you should be honest with yourself. You in your position and I in mine, you would not have knocked on my door If it hadn't been your brother. So no. If I had the option to choose a brother, it certainly wouldn't be you. I can see it in your eyes, you probably think I'm cruel, and maybe I am but not by my design. I have to say it clearly, and few people would admit it. I'm a great man, an honest man, so I can say that. The honest man has a mission in life he has an exemplary function. Being unassailable, he must use his high standard to represent justice. And it's not always fun. Some days I must do the hard work of turning my heart to stone. And if I let myself go, I would give some money to the poor. - You should let yourself go. - Yes of course. I should applaud them for doing nothing. Giving money to a parasite, is giving booze to an alcoholic - You love your money. - I'm just like everyone. Everybody love my money and you the first You don't know what it's like to be rich. - It's awful? - Yes, sometimes. Probably also because you decide to be a great, honest man. You think you're very smart. Do you even know what it is? To be an honest person? I'll explain it to you, so you'll know. I'll tell you a story which happened 35 years ago. From which all my life as an honest man comes from. I made a choice that day and I've always stayed on that path. I was 20 years old. My boss entrusted me with some 1,000 francs bills that I should give to a Mr. Delannoy. He put them on my desk and he added: "Count them". He leaves and I count the amount. There were 10,000 more francs. At that time, that was a lot of money. - Still is. - Yes of course... It was a large amount and I myself needed money. I still had to pay 6,000 francs to the tailor and had to buy another travel bag. Well, that sum in my burning hands... As I'm saying it to you, I returned it to my boss. Admit that you can't say the same? No, but not in the way that you are thinking... I don't find your gesture incredible, but the importance you give it is. What I mean is that you boast of not having stolen 10,000 francs. And you've been around ever since, being a pain in the ass for 35 years. This conversation is over. That's what you think. Bye bye. Excuse me if I don't walk you to the door. You are too honest to be polite. He will not answer. Yeah? Why are you in the dark? Can I ask who is that person you just received? - No. - Why not? - This is a... - Family business? - Why must it be family? - I just tried a guess. What do you mean by that? You never sent Emile to warn me about a visitor, it was new. In the future I will let you know, so let it become a habit. - You really have a temper. - I'm definitely not in a good mood. All my problems, rumors of a strike, incompetent government... I do not see why I should be in a good mood. Can you please look for my drops? And come and call me at 8 p.m. to see if there is something interesting on TV for a change I'm gonna change my clothes. Menu with chicken, 220 francs. Life is not a bed of roses ... ... I say it like it is ... ... As something is bringing you pleasure, ... ... another will bring pain again ... ... But as it is, as I see it ... ... like some sort of conspiracy ... ... You cannot spend your life jumping off bridges. So, shall I jump into the water? - The lady is at the table, sir. - No. But she is, sir. Don't say to me: "The lady is ready." Just say: "Your food is ready, sir." That would be nicer for me. Don't forget your drops, are you in a hurry? Yeah. Why don't you visit the doctor? Because he is your personal doctor. A couple must have different doctors. Both of you go first. Was that your brother who you just received? You know very well that my brother died 35 years ago. - Maybe he wasn't dead. - Please go. I have already said that the candles can only burn on Sundays. - Do you have a pencil for me, Pierre? - Yes mom. Oh, a family meal. If not exquisite, then so sinister. The silence of death, minus the sound of cutlery and slurping soup. - A little more soup, sir? - No more soup, next course. I'm going to serve you a piece of chicken. Because? - As simple as that, for kindness. - Thank you. Swear that he was not your brother. You are irritating, you know that? - What kind of chicken is this? - It's a normal chicken. It's a fat hen! When everyone will have eaten, there'll still be more than half of it left. All a waste. while there are people who do not receive food. This chicken, I never ate one so good, I think. You guessed it, you can be happy. So it was your brother, the young man that was dead for 35 years, and he turns out to be a bum. - Why a bum? - Emile told me that. He dresses modestly, but he's not a bum. My bad. I must ask: do you intend to invite him often? I'm not obligated to share my intentions with you. No one should tell me what to do. If you didn't ask Emile, if his answers hadn't guided you, You wouldn't know my brother visited me. And we wouldn't have this conversation either, something I intended to avoid. I've married you, not your family. And vice versa. So basically, my family does not do business with my marriage. What should I tell the children? Tell them the truth. Otherwise, they would pester the butler. But I won't speak about it, tell them that. Good night. Good night. - So? - It was his brother. I was allowed to say it, but you're not allowed to talk about it. I saw him only for a second in the lobby. It's amazing how he looks like dad. It's no good to have an uncle like that. Do we have to see him again? Certainly not. So, shall I jump into the water? Come in. - You're not sick? - No. I hadn't seen you today, it's 5 p.m., I was a little worried. - You shouldn't worry, but thank you. - You haven't eaten yet. - No. - Here it is, two eggs. Be careful, they are fresh, you must eat them immediately. You are very friendly. Some people would disagree! I have a bad temper according to them. - And sometimes they are right, but... - One day is not like another. That's how it is. Do you need anything else? - Yeah. I need a pin... for the eggs. - Please. - Thank you. It was very difficult for him to concentrate on anything other than his brother. How odd! - To the Opera. - Yes, sir. Cleaning up is a dirty business... Arrived at Place Vendôme, Albert asked his driver for him to continue to Boulevard Magenta. I'll be back in 15 minutes. - Wait for me there. - Very well sir. - Where to? - 8, Rue Paul Blin. Tuesday night, a woman loves you... ... Wednesday night, she doesn't ... ... As to know what she didn't like, ... ... She herself doesn't know ... ... But even if they are all fickle, ... ... And we are all fools ... ... You cannot spend your life jumping off bridges. - Can you wait for me, please? - How long? Fifteen minutes. - Mr. Alain. - Room 12. - Is it at the second floor? - Yeah, there is no third floor! You are his brother, I can see that! He wasn't well last night. He might need a doctor, and there is one in Room 18, an old guy from Roubaix, he doesn't seem like a quack. - Room 18, thank you. - You are welcome. - Albert? - The master has left, Madame, that's why I took the opportunity to clean up a bit. - At last. Do you know where he went? - No, Madame. Come in! - Who's there? - Albert. - What's wrong? - It's not contagious. It's my heart. I can't get up for a proper greeting. I have to stay still. Sit down, please. - Have you already been to the doctor? - In Montreal. - It's been six months. - Do you need one? I will die with or without one. Do you have any heart disease? Jokes aside, I mean. Last year, I had some warnings. I mean, nothing surprising, because we are twins. Yes, apparently yes. You are visiting? What brings you here? Are you curious? Hey? We told each other so much yesterday... That was ugly. - You need something, a drink? - No, thanks. I want to know, why have you come to see me? I've been thinking a lot about you, since last night. - I also thought of you. - I'm sure of it. I slept very badly. Like a flash, I have seen your life. For 30 years. You must have seen it darker than it was. - What was it like? - My life? In any case... It was, like a novel, funny, yes, I have been a wrestler, a policeman, a singer, a pimp... I was a faith healer, once. And I did heal some people, imagine! I was a counselor in Ottawa. I even wore a cassock in Quebec. You can not imagine how much fun it was conning people. They deserve it so much. Being someone different from yourself, one month, two months... that's more than interesting. The way we look alike, we could have made legendary pranks. But, you're not like that at all. No. Look where it brought you. It was not boring at all. I don't regret anything. - And you, do you have fun? - No. If you told me "Yes", I wouldn't have believed you. - What do you have? - I feel my age. It's too much for one man. Tell me quickly what's going on in your head. I'll be quick. Grow a beard and adopt a different name. And I'll give you something. Go to one of my factories, a job awaits you, so long as you don't stay in Paris. - In the countryside? - I'll sign the contract immediately. I'll even pay you six months of salary right now. You killed me on my 18th birthday. And today you are burying me. You won't even have to pay that much. What's going on? Alain? - Hasn't Father returned yet? - Not yet, Miss. I do not refuse to help, but I have my train in 20 minutes. - What exactly happened? - He complained of his heart, he was in a lot of pain and he turned pale. He died. - Where is the? - Over there. That's an embolism, I think. In Paris they call it a myocardial infarction, but it's the same. - Twin? - Twin. You have been warned! Thank you, doctor, how much do I owe you? Please, let it be. - Have you searched his notebook? - Of course. I don't see anything special nowhere. If it was a business meeting he would have noted it in his journal. - Put it in my room. - There's Pierre. What are the two of you doing here? - Your father hasn't come back yet. - Yes and what? - We never eat before eight. - But at 19.00 he is always at home. - Do you want something, mother? - Yes, I want to find out something. - Did you call me, Madame? - At what time did you arrived? 10 minutes ago, Madame. So you were away for a while? I went to the bookstore, buying paper. After 19:00? Thank you. So that's it. I guessed as much. With a maid! Your father is a boor! - You're wrong about it. - I've seen it on their faces. - Evelyn was out with me. - Ah, good... Why "ah, good"? You said it, not me. There is friends, there is family ... ... But you shouldn't need them.... ... And when you're away, they're the first to badmouth you!... ... And even if there's so much villains... ... and bastards to envy you ... ...You cannot spend your life jumping off bridges. He's never happy but I have to admit that he seemed depressed last night. Don't speak like that of your father, please! He was worried, but it was about this visit. We should wait in the living room. If he found us in the office, he wouldn't like it. I waited there to be close to the phone. Hello? No, he's not back yet. Who's calling? I'm René, Mr. Pierre. No, I left him close to Boulevard Magenta and he took a cab and said to wait 15 minutes. That will be more than an hour and that's why I ask. I wouldn't worry. But there is maybe something strange... Is it better for me to wait or should I...? No, wait there and report. - What's going on? - Nothing, mom. Who were you calling? - It was a friend. - Wasn't that your father? I am telling you it wasn't. - Pierre, you know something. - No, mom. - You are calling his wife ? - Yeah. - Did you have the number? - I found it among his things. Hello? - Dead? - Yes, Madame, since 10 minutes, maybe. But... how did he die? From an embolism, at least that's what the doctor said. Yes, Madame, I am his brother. I will leave immediately and come there with my personal doctor. Tell me your address, sir. I don't like her widow voice. Pierre! Juliette! - Your father is dead. - Mother! - Oh, you hurt me with your forehead. - But mother... No. This is suspicious. Call the police and then Doctor Ogier. I feel dizzy. You were not feeling well last night, and today it is your brother who dies. That's right, it's terrible. Come in. Hey, do I have to wait this long? It's my brother's fault. He just died. - Oh! Were you twins? - Yeah. And your brother is dead. That doesn't look good for you, they say, when one leaves, shortly the other follows. You'll have to wait anyway. If necessary, you will be a witness. Your brother, now I remember. your brother was left by his car in Boulevard Magenta And after that he got into my taxi. Very well, thank you. Not a fun day in my hotel. - It's not fun for anyone, ma'am. - What tone he uses with me! He must have a big share of the legacy. He changed already. Be kind to people, and they repay you like this. And I brought him two fresh eggs. I mean as fresh as could be. You don't come, you stay at home. Answer the phone. - Don't forget to pick up the doctor! - Come, Pierre. The 3,000 francs of yesterday; he probably went to eat. Maybe it would have been better to call his personal doctor. He does not have a personal doctor, he is never sick. Was, I mean... Come in. - Commissioner Vincent. - Alain Ménard-Lacoste. I am his brother. - Incredible. - We were twins. - When did he die? - An hour ago. Where you there when he died? Right in front of me. Did you open his shirt and loosen his tie knot? I helped him, yes. Can I see your papers? Are you a traveler? You haven't been here that long. It will be a week. So, your brother came to see you, and while he was visiting something happened to him and he died. - Yes. - The lady from the hotel says as much. And it is the truth. Oh, the truth, it's our job to find it. - Find it? The truth is not hidden. - That's not always the case. - Doctor Ogier. - Commissioner Vincent. Alain Ménard-Lacoste, his brother. Madam, let me do the first findings. The resemblance is unbearable. What are your conclusions, doctor? At first sight, it’s not a suspicious death. It's an embolism, in the countryside they call it myocardial infarction, but it's the same. Madam, I must empty the content of your husband's trouser pockets. It is necessary for research. Pierre, could you do it? I can't bear it anymore. I have all that is necessary. - A cigarette holder. - A cigarette holder. - A lighter. - A lighter. - A handkerchief. - A handkerchief. - A pen. - A pen. - A bunch of keys. - A bunch of keys. - A wallet. - A wallet. - A letter. - A letter. - Is it for me? - No. Would you let me? "Codicil to my last will. Only the notary should open it." - Sir, do you recognize this letter? - No. - He didn't show it to you? - No sir. During your conversation, did he make any allusion to it? None. Sir, you must be available to the court. - What does it mean? - You have to stay in Paris. Who do you think I am ? My brother just died. - Pierre, I want to take a look at that. - Okay, Mom. Madam, you can't keep any object. I was not going to do such a thing, Mr. Commissioner. Handkerchief, lighter, cigarette holder, pen, wallet and a bunch of keys. It's okay, madam. Come on. What am I supposed to do now? You must go home. Your son will stay until we take the body away. I'll do whatever it takes to bring the body to the coroner. Good. Sir, you are a witness that we are doing a count of your father's objects. The objects are in a sealed envelope, and are under my responsibility. Let's go. I can confirm that your father did not suffer. Nobody asked me anything so I'm telling you now. Back home, Madeleine, who knew the code for Albert's safe, but never had the key, opened it right away. An hour later they took "Albert"'s corpse to the morgue, where the autopsy would take place and clear "Alain". While the autopsy was being performed, Albert's wife was still searching. And meanwhile, Albert did so too, an autopsy of both brothers' earthly possessions was underway. Files, contracts, 10 kilos of gold, one bag, two bags... Three bags full of 20 dollar coins, a metal chest, closed with key. Albert found only some love letters. Who says love letters says also farewell letters. But there were some farewell letters even more impregnated with love than the others. The open chest revealed a distant, pitiful past love story... It amounted to three letters, almost all about money... and was indeed crushed with 4 kg of gold. - He was so loved. - He was so rich. In the evening Albert went for a walk. And, by pure chance, he dined in the little restaurant where his brother had eaten very well the day before. That's nice ! I wasn't sure you would come back. I have a veal kidney, just for you! Yesterday I found you quite sad, but you are feeling better today, I can tell. Sit in your place, sir. I want this to be your table. Don't worry about the price, it will be reasonable. At the same time Madeleine and her two children were planning away from the servants. It's strange to have one empty chair at the table. Albert returned early at Alain's room. He would have liked to stay somewhere else but that would have been too risky. He had to be available for the police, and probably was watched. And by coming home early, he would soon learn about some strange things he would never had known otherwise. The sheet was dirty, everything was dirty and everything looked sinister. I'm sorry, I'm late. You can not expect fixed hours from a job like this. I was with a Dutchman, who just couldn't stop. So I can't stay, I have another appointment with a Congressman at 11 p.m., A weekly customer this one, since 9 years. He did dirty stuff for the Nazis during the Occupation, and today he is in the Assembly... Curious, isn't it? From the Dutch... Here, dear, fifteen thousand francs. Come on, no whining. What is 15,000 francs anyway? Some days I can earn 40.000, if not 50.000! So don't frown your little face. I don't want to see you in misery! We slept only once, but I liked it. Don't ask why, I don't know why myself. I won't say you're good for your age, because you're not a man of your age. Maybe it's because you're a former pimp. What is it with this face? You look better than yesterday, but you look like you're troubled. - Have you seen your brother? - My brother? You told me Monday you'll go see him, so? Yeah. - Didn't go well? - Yeah. - Are you going to keep seeing him? - No. - Because? - Because he died. - He died? - Yeah. Darling, now I understand why you are weird right now. You're sad? Of course you are. - Even if he was a bastard. - It's not like that... You told me so yourself, dear. Come on, let's not talk about it. - Did he leave you anything? - I don't know yet, it's possible. I forgot my cigarettes. Do you have a cigarette? Yes, in one of the pockets of my vest. The matches are on the table. - Tell me, I want to ask you a question. - I'm listening, dear. I wanted to ask you this, when we... How comes a woman like you, with your physique...? I was waiting for this. It's the question that everyone asks. Why does a woman who looks proper like me has this job? Do you know what does it? Being tall and having a small nose. The nose does it all. That's why you see women with shortened noses. Well, this distinguished woman will tell you something... When I started, it hurt me a lot. If I want to get clients, I always have to light a cigarette and walk slowly. Without the cigarettes, the johns say: "Not this one." "She used to be someone." "It will cost too much and could bring me trouble" That's why the other girls call me "the Countess". - Then I have another question. - I hear you, honey. Suppose my brother left me something decent... - Don't start hoping much about family. - It's still possible... OK, let's imagine... Would you do it...? Would you like it...? To stay with me? A kept woman? - Why not? - I'm afraid I can not. I've been asked before, even by younger men. To tell the truth, it wouldn't be honest of me to accept this offer. You must understand that my business is well organized. - Organized? - Yes darling. We are 6 on that block, me and other women with the same job. The street you found me, remember? In this area, everyone has her specialty. The Pink Flamingo, who has only one leg, the Pillow, that's the fat one, the Sweetheart, the little one, the Caribbean, the Ginger and then me, the Countess. So there's no competition, no whining, And there's what nothing can replace... freedom. Being with only one man? Never. I like to be able to say "No" ! Do you ever say "No"? I can choose if I go out or not. Don't think about it, dear. I want to stay with you two good hours every 5 or 6 days, or even more. Let me lie next to you, after my work. For pleasure. And you can tell me beautiful stories, like the other day. Beautiful stories? Your travels, your loves... All the things you know, true or false. It's so late? I have to go. Kisses. - Do you have a wristwatch? - No. Take one. - A woman's watch? - Of a woman? You're crazy. It comes from a black man, he was so beautiful... - Doctor Ogier is here, Madame. - Let him in, quick. - Good morning, doctor. - Hi, Madam. - Good day. - Sit down. I have the results from the autopsy. Although it is a sad situation, I would like you to know what happened. Just tell me briefly what was in it. I bring the irrefutable proof of the natural death of your husband. There is no possibility for doubt. But, doctor... This sudden death, in such peculiar circumstances. Your feelings are very natural. I also had my reservations. He was in that sordid room, his car was waiting for him at a distance, and especially the strange attitude of that individual. It was normal to be suspicious about Albert's death. Anyway, you brought the evidence, we can't argue anymore. Nothing can stop me... from grieving I mean. You have to admit that the attitude of his brother was almost despicable No, Madame, it was the resemblance that made you imagine things. Between his brother and him you had the right to think: Why my husband and not his brother? You didn't find his attitude despicable but his presence. And let's be honest: How could have he reacted? I seemed to me that his attitude was very good. Very discreet. Anything else would have been unwarranted. - He is right. - Yes, maybe. Well, we won't see him anymore. so I won't have to think about it. You will probably see him again at your husband's funeral. If he's so discreet, I hope he will refrain from appearing. I will not interfere in this, it's not my place. If you allow me, I will leave. Do you think he will be at the funeral? - Perhaps we are obliged to invite him. - Obliged? This is too much! Are we required to invite him? You shouldn't see it that way, it's your brother-in-law, you must include him in the invitations. It's normal that he too will be present at the funeral of his brother. I don't see why he shouldn't go. - The Commissioner, Madame. - Show him in. No, Doctor, stay. do not leave me alone. I greet you, madame. Mr, Doctor. Given the result of the autopsy of your late husband, I must give you this authorization of inhumation. And I also return your husband's objects. I closed the envelope myself and it has not been opened. I would also like to express my respects, Madame. - And my condolences. - Thank you, Commissioner. I advise you not to open without the presence of the notary the envelope found in your husband's wallet. Don't forget that it was named: "Codicil to my last will". Follow his advice, madame. - Where is his will? - At the notary. So all the more reason. - Madame, sir, doctor. - Goodbye, Commissioner. - See you soon, Madame. - Goodbye and thank you, doctor. - Pierre, see the doctor off. - Yes, mother. Goodbye, doctor. We need to arrange a appointment with the notary, Pierre. Right now, mother. - What is this? - They brought the clothes. Do I have to put it on your bed? No, put it on Monsieur's bed, to have room. But Madame, in his bed... - What's on his bed? - Monsieur. It's true! It's very kind of you to bother, Miss. It's not a bother. Mrs. Moulin asked me to sew this black band as I was delivering her. I did it with great pleasure. Wouldn't you rather have black tissue on your jacket lapel? It's fancier. I don't want to be fancy. - You have beautiful eyes, miss. - Thank, sir. - Are you free tonight for dinner? - No sir. - I would invite you... - No sir, you owe me 300 francs. I'm sure she would have dined with Alain. The notary awaits us tomorrow at 2 p.m. Alright. I warn you that he wants dad's brother to attend the meeting. - For what reason? - It's the law. Say you don't know his address. - I just gave it to him. - What? You should have consulted me before. I want you to ask for my permission on these decisions. I am the head of the family now. Do not forget. Come in. - What is it? - They come with the beer. Beer, what for? To put Monsieur in his coffin. [in French beer and coffin sound the same] Oh, that... Pierre, can you accompany them? I can't deal with that. Yes, mom. - Are you sure it's yours? - They are the same. You think? Pull it up. It looks so sad, but it's not ugly. It's even somewhat agreeable to the face. - What is going on? - We have to go in here... They couldn't take the stairs. This coffin is magnificent. It's so quiet, and they must be putting me in the coffin right now. Poor Alain. Do you want to see him for the last time? Whom? - Dad. - Oh. Yes of course. Mom, don't you think the servants should come to? Yes of course. Drafted in Paris on February 19, 1947, signed Albert Henri Julien Ménard-Lacoste. Perfect! Let's take a look at the codicil. - Is it really necessary? - It is essential, Madame. - His will is formal, isn't it? - If there is no change. - You believe that...? - I don't believe anything, Madame. I have a letter that you must hear and that we legally cannot ignore. Well. Today, November 20, 1952, being of sound mind, I draft the following instructions: I cancel all previous provisions... stipulated in my will... Huh? in my testament deposited before the notary Denizot in February-March 1947. I cancel the above provision, and my last will is: First. I name my brother, Alain Louis Roger Ménard-Lacoste, my universal heir, so that he can pay to my widow an annuity of 3 million. To my daughter, a dowry of 4 million. And to my son the monthly payment of 80,000 francs, on the condition of being deputy director of my companies, and justify it with his work. And that each of my house employees receive 100,000 francs. And that the tombstones of my parents continue to be well maintained. Made in Paris, on November 20, 1952. Signed: Albert Henri Julien Ménard-Lacoste. - It's not possible! - It says it clearly here, Madame. - Are you sure it's his handwriting? - Of course, Madame. Compare these two letters. It is the same type of paper. It's incomprehensible. There is something very strange in all this. This sudden death... His brother, who he hadn't seen in 30 years. And this letter. A letter that contradicts all previous provisions. This letter that suddenly favors his brother. Do you think that is normal? Your insistence forces me to ask: What do you mean by strange and abnormal? I feel targeted by your words, and I would like you to specify their meaning. The death of Albert is a big blow, I understand it well. But, on the other hand, it's not that surprising, that a man who knew the degradation of his health, and who planned his passing, would want to make it up to a brother with whom he had reconciled. Maybe he thought that I was more suitable to run his affairs. And on the other hand I think the autopsy that was done on your husband rules out any other causes. Indeed. So when you talk about something strange and abnormal you refer to the last letter of your husband? Yes. Well. And you wonder if it is really written by his hand? You probably think that I am the author. I can imagine it and I would like to take a look at your writing. To compare with his. And see if the resemblance arrives to that extreme. Even if I agreed, and I would, it wouldn't convince you. You could accuse me of disguising my true writing. We have to do a better check, Madame. Have you received the items that were in your husband's pockets? Yes. Can your son bring us the wallet of your husband? There's no need, I have it with me. Perfect, can you take it out? Thank you. Can you look in the compartment inside? There is a letter. That is my letter from Tuesday. Now compare that letter's writing with that of your husband. You will notice that they are different. It was a pleasure, Madame. Esquire. Goodbye, my dear nephews. It was very serene, if that's possible. - Madame must be pleased. - Yes... Pleased is not the word... but I'm satisfied because I did what I had to do. I hope my husband appreciated the effort from beyond. I hope he was impressed. It was enough, wasn't it? 18 candles more or less, what difference does it makes? Take my headdress. - Shall I put it with mothballs, Madame? - For whom? - I don't know. - Well, do that, then. - The crowd was small. - Half. - Half of what? - Of the guests. Mrs. Dorfeuil could have worn a somber dress. - Did you see Mrs. Rinoza's hat? - How could I miss it? You should have seen Henriette. Do you know how many times she powdered herself? - No. - 8 times. Why did you gestured for Alain to walk in the front with us, while we were following the hearse? He was discreet in the background. You insisted to bring him in the front row. - Why did you do that? - For our own good, boy. I went even further, I warn you. Since your father has designated him as universal heir, and that he is now in command of our businesses, I decided to offer him the free disposition of your father's office. What "oh"? Instead of criticizing me it's worth thinking about. In the end, he is your uncle. It will be a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the afternoon in the office. It doesn't bother us. We won't even be forced to see him But he will know that we are still here. His way of doing things during the funeral gave me confidence. It would be foolish of us to antagonize him for no reason and turn him against us. And if you are wrong, mom? If his presence becomes a nuisance? I can still go back on my offer. Can you inform Madame of my arrival? The brother of Monsieur has arrived and he asked me to let you know. Thank you. I'll be right back. So that's why she wears her good robe. - Good morning. - Good morning, Madame. As agreed, I will use this office to continue the work of my unfortunate brother. Thank you. You must understand. With the tragic death of Albert I expressed some hostile feelings against you. Please don't hold them against me. I want you to feel good here. Can we forget it? Let me explain how Albert organized things. All about the factories of Creil, Lyon and Bordeaux are on this desk. Perfect. For the rest, I am at your service to help you with whatever you need. I have summoned the bosses of the factories. - That must be them. - I'll leave you then. Thanks, Madame. Messrs. Bertier, Verlonbrez and Duverdon. Let them in. Well, I have nothing bad to say. A good meeting. A little cold, but correct. I only hope one thing... I don't want him to come in this room or in the dining room. - It won't happen! - Good. I want to tell you that nothing should change for now, but I will study your propositions. And I can tell you that your requests will be heard. Rushing for changes would look like a commentary on my brother's management. And I don't want that reputation. But in his memory, and according to the wishes expressed in his will, employees will receive double salary this month. I want his memory to be honored by all. I would like to thank you, on his behalf and mine. I have to admit that this gesture with the employees, it's extraordinary. You're right. Has Mr. Verlonbrez told you? Yes. He just arrived. Can't we invite him to a cup of coffee with us? It's already starting... Can you tell Mr. Verlonbrez to come to my office at 2 p.m.? Very well, sir. Come in. Mom wonders if you would take a cup of coffee with us. With great pleasure. - Madame? - Serve cognac and maybe liquor too... Yes, Madame. - Good morning. - Good morning, Madame. - How many sugar cubes? - Sugar-free. - Never sugar? - Never. Albert sometimes took three lumps in his coffee. Three? A man of excess! Oh no. - No? - No. - So he was thrifty? - Yes. It is a virtue. If you have not been deprived of anything... No need to exaggerate. You're not exaggerating, mom. Don't you remember your coat anymore? How many months did you have to wait for it? And your ski suit, that was a battle! It's funny, I thought that he spent a lot. He was not generous nor attentive. Pity. For the house, I was asking for a new vacuum cleaner for six months... - Emile... - Excuse me, Madame. He wasn't very expressive. but his severity can be justified. He had a flawless behavior in life. The guest Monsieur was waiting for is here. He is in the office. Thank you. I'll be right back, excuse me. So, what is your impression? I like him, I have to admit. He has a softer look than dad. And you, what is your impression? I would go even further I like him more than dad. I did not mean as much. But, he is more likeable. Yes, but different from Monsieur. What is your opinion? I'll tell you after I'll cross him in the hallway. These provisions must be kept a secret. Until new orders. With this proposal, I will make a statement within 48 hours. Good, Mr. Director. Monsieur. - Is Monsieur alone? - Yes, Miss. Come in. Come in! Mom wants to know if you will give us the pleasure to have dinner with us tomorrow. - Unfortunately, tomorrow is impossible. - And after tomorrow? OK. - So you've never been married? - No Madame, never. Don't call me Madame, only Madeleine. So I can call you Alain. OK. I am touched to see you sitting in his place. - So, you've never been married. - Never. I love life too much. I love my freedom. You can tell us your whole story, Alain. I have led an exuberant life, I'm ashamed to say as much. It was easy life, independent, free. I hardly had any manners and no respect for the bourgeois tradition that breed people of virtue, like you father was. When I think of our fates, the sordid hotel room where my life led me, and then this most luxurious house, most comfortable... when I breathe this family atmosphere, the emotion invades me... Deeply. You are going to know this atmosphere, Alain. Albert wanted it that way. So be it. - Do you know what I'm thinking? - Speak at your ease. That's a guy who already seems to regret his past life. He said it was bad but with his eyes... He contradicts himself, right? Exactly. His eyes contradict his words. What he regrets is to have never experienced the independent lifestyle as Alain did. Give me your arm, Alain. - I like this tune, don't you? - Very nice. Will you sit next to me? There's too much light, dear, to watch TV. Television is so interesting. We apologize for this interruption. due to a technical problem. No, thanks. - You do not smoke? - Never. That's good. I never liked the smell of tobacco from Albert's mouth. Thank you. You're a charming man, Alain. I love this life you have lived. If you knew the ideas that are going through my head... We would not betray the memory of him. No, you wouldn't betray him. Don't say anything, let me talk. We are alone. She goes too far. But we could recover a dozen millions. Alain, Alain, I can't help it! She could have waited two or three days. This close contact with Madeleine suddenly was very unpleasant for him. He had foreseen a lot, but not that. After so many years of abstinence, the idea of sleeping with his wife... made him almost terrified. Hello? No, I'm her daughter. Who calls? Good evening, doctor. I will bring her right now. Come in! - Why are you calling me now, dear? - Doctor Ogier wants to talk to you. Right now. Excuse me. Hello Doctor. Yes, I hear you. I apologize for calling this late, but I’ve been thinking about something and I have a question. Question that I want to ask you and only you, because it is something... quite serious and singular. Did you husband undergo surgery a few years ago? Yes, Albert had an appendicitis operation. and that was 3 years ago. Tuesday, nothing was not found on the corpse. No scar on the abdomen. Why didn't you told me? How awful! Why should that have been signaled? So it's dad who is here! Doctor, it's horrible! And more than the others, is oneself ... ... on which you can hardly count on... ... and we end up harvesting ... ... all the nonsense we sow... ... but although we are our worst enemy... ... disgusted with oneself and the whole of it ... ... You cannot spend your life ... ... jumping off bridges. Having hit the bottom of human baseness, disgusted with himself as he was with others and jealous of his brother, He moved on, forward. And no one ever found out what happened to him. THE END
