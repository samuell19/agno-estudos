(gentle jazz music) So you like my view? Beautiful. Tell me what you want. Nothing. Right now. I just want you to get your money's worth. Oh, I'm sure I will. Why don't you run a bath? Okay. (sultry jazz music) I'll be waiting. Are you coming in? In a while. Just wanna relax a bit. (suspenseful jazz music) Where are my boys? Yeah (chuckles), yes. Here, take 'em out. Bring 'em back soon, I don't wanna eat alone. [Waiter] Here you are, sir. I must've left my fuckin' glasses in the car. Run down and get 'em. [Man] All right. Dumb bastards. Thought you really had me this time. (suspenseful music) (glass clatters) (man grunts) (man groans) I missed you. You want a lick? No. Wanna hear some music? Music? Yeah. ("Fur Elise") [Woman] Sure you don't want a lick? (traffic hums) I have to be going. But you didn't even touch me. I had a wonderful time. You already paid me. A little something extra. You were great. - I was? - Yeah. I couldn't have done it without you, thank you. (midtempo jazz music) (door thuds) (tires screech) (garage door hums) (dog barks) Hey. Come on, man, pack up your shit and get outta here. (can clatters) [Homeless Man] Good morning to you, too. Great to see ya. Here, sorry, man. It's all right, you can stay, it's all right. Hey, hey. Thank you. I'll pay you back someday, man. All right. (gentle jazz music) (keys clatter) [Broadcaster] It's valued, it's $1,600,000 rent for the few weeks that (music drowns out voice). (somber instrumental music) (traffic hums) You were right, it wasn't a heart attack. So then why do you still have that listed as cause of death? Oh well, technically he did die of a heart attack, I mean, the thing stopped pumping, but after you told me to check, I realized I'd seen almost no arterial rupturing or ventricle trauma, no cell damage, the heart just stopped. Also, did you see his neck? Contusions to the lower jaw from upward force. Signs of trauma, just like you said there might be. The guy wore a glove, there was no prints. So I did a full toxicity battery on him. We sound a fall but lethal trace of what might be binoltryphdoxine, too small to be listed as a certain cause, in a court anyway. Hold on, hold on. So you're saying the guy was poisoned, right? Yep, that's what I'm sayin'. To you, anyway. We think we're on to somebody. A professional, specializes in accidents. (waves roar) (ominous electronic music) (coins clink) (engine hums) [Peter] Evening, Elvis. You know I always hated that name. You liked it fine in the Cordillera. Well, I was a kid then. Yeah well, we were all kids then. No, I don't think you were ever a kid. Did you come here to read? No, you missed the point. I like what I see. Good work. I've got a new tune for you. No, no thanks. That was my last dance, I told you and the committee I'm takin' a break. This is not for the committee, this is personal, this is for me. Well, I don't do non-committee work anymore. I arranged that for you, remember? Well, this person, she's an old family friend. Family? As in yours or as in the mob? I may have some questionable clients but I certainly don't work for the mob. If you need some help, her father's an old friend of mine, and I'd like you to help her. Then you can take that nice, long vacation as you've been talking about, hm? - I'll think about it. - Hm, okay. (gentle jazz music) (buttons click) (phone rings) [Woman] Hello? I'm a friend of Mr. Mayhew's. Mr. Pike, I wanted, I really need to discuss a matter with you. Can you meet me now? [Woman] Yes, I can. [Charlie] Take PCH north about two miles past point doom, Nicholas Canyon. Make a left, pull into the turn off right there, I'll call you. (phone rings) Yes? Just go straight ahead down to the beach, I'll meet you in the parking lot. Okay. (engine rumbles) (waves roar) You take direction well. Thanks. Well, you know what I do, so let's discuss your situation. My, um, husband was killed last year in an auto accident. Only it wasn't an accident, Mr. Pike, he was murdered by his business partner. How do you know? Mr. Pike, my husband was a good man, but sometimes he did some slightly dishonest things. What sort of things? He cheated on the corporate taxes, borrowed money from certain accounts to pay bills on others. Well everyone does that, so I'm told. You don't cheat, Mr. Pike? I don't lie. My husband's firm did business with the government, buying equipment, military surplus, selling it to foreign governments, that sort of thing. There was this one deal, though, close to $20 million, equipment. It was supposed to be delivered to a client - in Latin America... - And what happened? A substitute was made? That's right. Of some grossly inferior equipment. But the firm had already received payment, and they pocketed the difference. And let me guess, his partner found out. I had an idea that something was going on, but he never talked to me. But he did leave a letter in the safe deposit box, a full confession. And besides, Mr. Mayhew said that you couldn't help... What did Mr. Mayhew say? He said that there might be another way. My husband's partner's named Bishop, here's his picture. There's one thing Mr. Mayhew didn't tell you. I don't get involved in family disputes. This is not a family dispute. It's personal, you want revenge, I don't blame you for that. I don't think I can help you, good luck. Wait, Mr. Pike, please, I. It isn't just revenge, it's survival. Bishop has somebody following me. (ominous music) Well that's no crime. No, but this was. This car mysteriously lost its brakes and went off a cliff on PCH. What's the point? The point, Mr. Pike, is this is my car. This woman is, was my housekeeper she was using it to go shopping that day. This man Bishop has everything he wants. Right, so why's he tryin' to kill me? [Charlie] Yeah. Because he knows that I know. Do you know him? A lotta men look like this? Will you do it? I'll think about it. Look, Mr. Pike, if it's a question of money, I'll pay it, I mean, whatever you want. Mr. Mayhew told me 100,000, I'm willing to pay a lot more. This has nothing to do with money. Mr. Pike, please. Without your help, I'll end up just like my husband. I'll think about it. (traffic hums) (horn honks) - Yes. - Got a question for ya. Ah. [Charlie] Remember a guy in a Cordilleras, was a guy named Bradford, he was an arrogant son of a bitch? [Peter] Bradord, yeah, I remember him, why? I thought he was dead. That's my understanding. I think he pissed off one jefe too many. (laughs) [Charlie] You sure about that? Yeah, I'm pretty sure, why? Eh, I thought I saw him. I guess it wasn't him, I'll talk to you later. Adios. (phone clicks) (gentle jazz music) (engine hums) [Detective] This is where our guy got his poison. Maybe they can tell us who he is. (doors thud) [Detective] How do you pronounce that drug again? [Detective] Binoltryphdoxine. - You say it this time. - Binoltryphdoxine. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, that's the guy all right, but, you know, his name wasn't any of those. It was Billings, I've got it right here on the receipt. Here, here we go. Dr. Billings, Randall M.D., right there. I mean, I checked the state license and everything. Hew as legit. - How did he pay? - Cash. Of course. You didn't happen to see what kind of car he was driving? Hey man, he only bought 50 milligrams of the stuff. He didn't exactly back his car up in here to load it, you know? Right, if he comes back, give us a call while he's still here, okay? Yeah yeah, sure. So I mean, who is this guy, anyway? The invisible man. (suspenseful music) (birds chirp) (phone rings) - Hello? - It's Collins. [Bishop] It's about time you called. Have you taken care of her? A little. How's the current invoice being handled? [Man] Slow and behind schedule, but we'll make up for it. Jordan Henning will not be a problem much longer. Yeah, well make up for it fast. I want her account closed out permanently. - Are we clear? - Understood. (phone clicks) (phone beeps) Julie, I'm going to the house. (ominous instrumental music) (keys jingle) (door thuds) (engine hums) So if I've got this right, this guy has more aliases than a baseball team has assholes. These aren't just aliases. I mean, these are four completely different people. Four different sets of prints, four different records, including birth certificates, I mean, the works. So what are you saying, you've got four suspects for these so-called murders? No sir, it's all the same guy. A killer who changes identities like a chameleon. What kind of person could do that? Given the level of sophistication, he's got to have been either the mob or the government. And maybe still is. (suspenseful instrumental music) (birds chirp) (door thuds) (traffic hums) (shutter clicking) (shutter clicking) (haunting instrumental music) (fire crackles) (phone rings) Hello? I thought about it. I'm in. And? I'll contact you. (phone thuds) (ominous music) (crickets chirp) (tools click) (tool beeps) (birds chirping) (door thuds) (engine rumbles) (phone beeps) (phone rings) - Hello. - Morning, Mr. Bishop. This is your wake up call. Leave Ms. Henning alone. Who the fuck is this? Oh, this is your conscience. Leave the lady alone, and I'll go away. Yeah, and suppose I don't. [Charlie] Well, I was hoping you'd listen to reason. No, I think you're gonna listen to me, ass wipe. First, you're gonna be a good messenger boy, and you're gonna hang up, and then you're gonna tell that bitch that no one messes with me and lives to brag about it. You got that loud and clear, asshole? Yes I do, the connection's fine. Anything else? Yeah, you know, I'm kind of a bad sport, so maybe after I'm done with her, I'll waste your ass, too. You know, I was never sure about you. [Bishop] About what? Whether it was you or not, now I am. I'm just sorry we couldn't work things out. Goodbye, Colonel Bradford. I'll be seeing you. [Bishop] What the fuck are you talkin' about? Who the fuck is this? (explosion booms) (fire roars) (water splashes) (birds chirping) Mr. Pike, what are you doing here? I said I'd be in contact. This isn't contact, this is breaking and entering. No, I'm not in the house, I'm only trespassing. So, when does it, when does it happen? - Already has. - Really, it has? [Charlie] Mm-hm. God, I can't believe it. Neither could he. I'm glad your work amuses you so much. On the contrary, I take my work very seriously. I'll go get your money. It's uh, it's inside, come in. All right. You want something to drink? Some water'd be fine. - Nice house. - Thank you. (birds chirping) - Thank you. - You're welcome. (sultry instrumental music) Your hands, it's amazing. That they can be so gentle and so loving. And yet be so dangerous and destructive. (crickets chirping) You could kill me right now if you really wanted to. At first, I was really disgusted by what you do. But then I realized the feeling in my stomach was just excitement. Do you think I'm strange? No. No, I don't. Doesn't your conscience ever get to you? I only kill people who deserve to die. In whose opinion? Mine. - I'll go get your money. - I don't want it. But you earned it. I would've killed him for free. I should go. Why? Because you're a client. It's dangerous. Well, I don't really care. I do. Well, when can I see you again? You can't. I don't work for anyone more than once. I don't wanna see you professionally. (Charlie sighs) It's too dangerous. (door thuds) (insects chirping) (suspenseful jazz music) (door thuds) (engine rumbles) (waves roar) Got a registration for me, Bobbi? [Bobbi] Yeah, but you're not gonna like it, it's a rental. A rental? [Bobbi] Yeah, I tapped into the rental company's computer. The guy who rented it paid cash, nice and anonymous. Driver's license said John Smith. All right, thanks, Bobbi, I'll talk to you. (phone clicks) (Charlie sighs) Rabin's phone bill shows he called this guy almost every day during his trial, Peter Mayhew. Well I'd expect him to call him. He was represented by Mayhew's law firm. - Right. - So what's your point? Out of 10 dead guys, Mayhew represented four of them. All 10 of the dead guys were represented by the same three lawyers. All top guns, all rep only rich clients. And all their clients were found innocent. Now, if you tell me that these three lawyers all work for the same law firm, then we might have something. Nope, but all three of them graduated the same class at Harvard. Okay, okay. I say we surveil 'em. Maybe another one of his clients is about to have an accident. (traffic hums) (coins clink) (ominous electronic music) [Broadcaster] According to a spokesman for the Justice Department, Bishop, who claimed to be a former employee of both the CIA and NSA, have been scheduled to testify in the pending investigation into illegal arms shipments to Latin America with links to government and paramilitary exile groups. Bishop was crucial witness in the prosecution's case. (phone beeps) (phone rings) Mr. Mayhew's office. [Charlie] Mr. Williams for Mr. Mayhew, put me through. I'm sorry, he's out of the office for the afternoon, may I take a message? Yeah, you tell him I need to meet him under the stars tonight. Under the stars? He'll understand. Fuck. (engine revs) I have a little problem. What kind of problem? What do you really know about Jordan Henning? Just what I told you. She's the daughter of an old friend of mine, why? Do you know what her husband did? Yeah, he was an arms deal. He dealt with governments, you know, he... He had a partner. Named Bishop. Yeah, we knew him as Colonel Bradford. He was here to testify for the Justice Department. Uh-huh. And you nailed that son of a bitch, eh? Yeah. (laughs) My gift to you, kid. My gift to you. (laughs) Hey, what's your problem? Well, I think someone other than Jordan wanted him dead. Well, come on, I mean, who didn't... Whoever that is wants her, too. Uh-oh. Well then why don't we just find out who that someone might be? (gentle instrumental music) (keys jingle) (engine rumbles) (tires screech) (Jordan gasps) What are you doing here? What are you so nervous about? Someone's still following me. [Charlie] I thought we took care of that. Yeah, so did I. This guy with the leather jacket and sunglasses, is that him? Yeah, he was the one I spotted before my housekeeper was killed. Do you know him? Not formally, I don't. He's been following me all morning. He's waiting outside for you right now. What should I do? Why don't you start by telling me the truth? - What do you mean? - About Bishop? I told you the truth about Bishop. Did you know your husband's partner was just about to testify before the Justice Department? How would I know that? Bishop had a lot of connections. CIA, NSA, the mob. A lot of people worried about what he was gonna say when he got on that stand. Maybe somebody sent you to see me with a sob story. So I take a job I wouldn't normally take. Bishop dies, case falls apart, and everybody's happy. And this guy with the leather jacket, maybe he's here just to protect you from someone like me. I'm telling the truth, I swear it. I'd like to believe you. (engine revs) (tires screech) Get down! (guns firing) (glass clatters) (Jordan whimpers) You all right? Yes. You can't go home, he knows where you live. I got a place in the hills nobody knows about. - You sure? - Yeah. No one knows? No. Okay, let's go. Let's get in my car, we'll follow. (slow instrumental music) (keys jingle) (door thuds) This is where I lived before I got married. Alone? Don't spend very much time here, do you? I'm glad you're here. I feel very safe with you. You are safe with me. I'll take care of you. [Jordan] Were you, were you ever married? No, no. You don't sound too sure about that. Well, I was never married, I was engaged, but not married. I met her when I was in South America. Vacation? No, I was down there workin' for the government. Doing what? I killed people. Worked for the NSA, I was part of a small group that was sent down to Colombia to infiltrate the drug cartels. What happened to your lover? She was my contact. She knew everyone, set me up with the players, so I could take 'em out. But when the government pulled us out, she was left there, exposed, unprotected. Tried to get her out, and I went back, but I was. They killed her. Did you ever find out who killed her? There was this guy who was supposed to have worked for our side. Had an idea it was him. But he just disappeared. Nothing I could do about it. But you never stopped looking for him, did you? Oh, I found him. Did what I had to do. Doesn't murder bother you? Yes, it bothers me very much. But you know what bothers me more? Lies. I'll never lie to you. I know that. (ominous music) Is everything all right? Yeah, for now. Go back to sleep. Good morning. Morning. I'm gonna take you back to my place. I don't think you're safe here alone. So why don't you get ready, and we'll leave right away, huh? Okay. So what we've got now is a non-existent killer and a bunch of attorneys who are knocking off their own clients. You wanna tell me why? Captain, these are the best paid criminal attorneys in the state. They have a reputation to uphold. Your client goes to jail, you lose your reputation, but the problem is, they know these guys are scum. They know they shouldn't be out on the street, so they figure, by knocking them off, justice is served, and they can go home and sleep easy at night. Gonna need something better than this to convince a jury. All 10 of these guys had connections to a cocaine cartel from the southern part of Colombia in the Cordillera Mountains. I don't need a geography lesson. There was a guy in the Justice Department who was a liaison on the prosecution side. Guy named Peter Mayhew. No shit. That's not all, sir. You remember the guy that just got whacked? Witness in the federal case Bishop? Yeah, but he wasn't one of Mayhew's clients, was he? No sir, but they worked together a dozen years back in this drug thing. Okay. But remember, these guys are lawyers. Make sure you do everything by the book. You don't have to worry, sir. This is a priority. (detective sighs) He nearly shot us both, and now you want to use me as bait? I don't think I can do this. You can't hide forever. But what if I screw it up? Then you'll be dead, which is what you'll be anyway unless I find out who this guy is. And if you find out who he is, are you gonna kill him? I don't know. The point is, I'll find out who sent him. If it was Bishop. You think it was someone else? I don't know what I think right now. I'm really scared. Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you, no. I promise. (midtempo jazz music) (lock beeps) (engine hums) (engine rumbles) (door thuds) (engine revs) All right, that's him behind you. Now just relax, and do everything just the way we discussed it. What if he tries to stop me before the intersection? Don't worry, he won't. Just relax, drive normal. We'll do it at this light. (brakes squeak) (engine revs) (horn honks) Go, go! (tires screech) What the hell's the matter with you? [Charlie] Great, you're in the clear. I'm gonna follow him for a while. You go back to my place tonight. [Jordan] Okay, please be careful. [Charlie] I will. Son of a bitch, get out of the way! God damn, come on! Motherfucker! Where'd you get your license, fuck! (traffic hums) (midtempo country rock music) Hey man. (men chatter) [Man] No, no, no, she did this before.

You should've taken me out when you had the chance, man. Now it's my turn. Wait a second guys, hold on. I'm a private investigator, I work for Jordan Henning. Before you do anything stupid, I gotta tell ya, she knows who you are. She'd just go to the cops. She's gonna go to the cops. (laughs) She'd call the cops. (man laughs) I don't think she's gonna go to the cops. I don't think you're gonna go to the cops. As a matter of fact, I don't think you're gonna go anywhere anymore, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey Tommy, Tommy man, back off. Let me take care of this, man. Ah, shit. (kick thuds) (Tommy groans) (kick thuds) (man groans) (gun fires) (gun fires) (man groans) (suspenseful music) Aw, fuck. (traffic hums) (dog barks) (ominous music) (waves roar) (birds chirp) (keys clatter) (tuner warbles) What are you doing, what's wrong? You tell me. Every time I kill someone for you it gets more complicated than it should. What are you talking about? I killed a cop. Now, he must've had somethin' on ya, right? What what is it? You said you wanted to find out if he was working for Bishop, you didn't say you were gonna kill him. Well, I did. Now why don't you just tell me the truth. I swear I've told you nothing but the truth. I swear to god. I killed a cop, goddamn it! (whimpers) How was I supposed to know he was a cop? I didn't hire him, I swear, Bishop did. Bishop wouldn't hire a cop to kill you, now tell me the truth. What, do you think I'm lying to you? Let me ask you this, what is my motivation for lying to you? All this is about is survival, mine. And if you don't care about that, then maybe I just better take care of it for the both of us. Just say the word, and this whole thing is over. (ominous music) Give me the gun. No, you don't trust me. Well go on and tell me I'm lying, tell me. You've got it all figured out, don't you? What are you waiting for, tell me you don't trust me. Jordan, I trust you. No, you don't. No, you don't. (sobbing) (gun fires) (glass clatters) Son of a bitch. How could you think any of that? Don't you know that I love you? (gentle instrumental music) (sighs) How screwed up would we be if we just eves dropped on his phone conversations? Very. You heard what the captain said. Besides, the DA office would die laughing if we asked for a phone tap order. So let's just forget about the request, carpe diem. It's fine with me. Though we'll never get inside his office today. Maybe not, but how about his car? You got it. Wonder how did you learn Latin? (detective chuckles) I have some things to take care of, I'll talk to you later, okay? Be careful. [Jordan] Bye. (suspenseful music) (tires screech) (phone rings) [Peter] Now what's so urgent? [Charlie] Something's come up. Concerns a friend of yours. I need to see you. Listen, today is shot, what about tonight? It'll have to do, same place? - Nine o'clock. - I'll be there. See ya, bye. (phone clicks) (suspenseful jazz music) (car alarm chirps) (engine hums) (engine rumbles) (tires screech) (phone rings) [Sean] This is Sean, leave a message, and I will call you. [Jordan] This is Jordan Henning. Please contact me, we need to talk immediately. (traffic hums) (door thuds) You got me into one hell of a mess. Why, what's wrong? I think she may have set me up. Why do you think that? [Charlie] You know those two dead cops? - Yeah? - Son of a bitch did the two guys from Midtown. [Peter] Well what makes you think shes' behind it? Well, if it's not her, then the cops are on me. Yeah. Well that only leaves the committee. The committee doesn't know who the hell you are. Oh come on, you're not serious. It's bullshit. You think I would do that to you after all we've been through? Come on. (sighs) It's her. She's the daughter of an old partner of mine. No, no she came to me filled with remorse over the assassination of her husband. What assassination? Her husband. He was shot to death about a year ago. What are you talkin' about? He wasn't killed in a car rigged by Bradford? No, a bunch of pros stopped his car, blew him away with shotguns, three or four of 'em. Why the hell didn't you tell me this the other night? Because I thought you knew, I thought she would tell you. Oh, why would she want to set you up? Maybe she thought you had something to do with her husband's death. You didn't, of course. Listen, how close to her are you? No, no, wait, wait. Maybe it's the cops, the cops. Maybe the cops are onto me. (Peter groans) And if it is the cops, maybe you could suggest a good defense attorney, preferably not a member of the committee 'cause I'd like to live if I win. Come on, that's uncalled for. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. My associates and I happen to believe in the criminal justice system of this country, and that's not self-righteous, that's principle. Something that I believe you used to profess to, some time ago. We're both self-serving. I'm just a little more honest about it than you are. We still have the right to choose whom we defend. Yeah. You also choose who to murder. We don't murder, you do. Think of it as the facilitation of retribution. Justice is served, so is society. Yeah. Thanks for the lecture, professor. - Mm-hm, so? - Well, I suggest until I find out what she's up to, that you suspend all committee activity. She might know a little more about us than she's letting on. Yeah, I think you're right. And listen. Just because she's the daughter of an old friend of mine, that doesn't mean shit. You watch your back. Son of a bitch. Facilitation of retribution, you hear that? Man we called this one right on the money. You get an address on his car's plates? Yeah, somewhere in the marina. You know, it's a pity we don't have a warrant. I just happen to have an old one, signed by a judge, never filled in the blanks. What do you say we pay our friend a visit? You got it. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbles) Ah, Mr. Hickok, please join us. We're the good guys, the police. Hope you have a permit for the gun. Yes, I do. And you have a warrant? As a matter of fact. You know, you have excellent taste, Mr. Kenser. Thank you. It's called juxtaposing. It undercuts visual monotony. - Is that right? - Yeah. Is that what this is all about? Because If it is, I could've explained it without a court order. We're more concerned with how you got the money to have such a nice place like this. You know, according to the IRS, you're retired, living on a government pension. That's right. What'd you do in the government that they gave you so much money at such a young age? Why don't you ask the IRS? You know, we did. It's classified. Well, I guess I can't talk about it then, can I? Well, Mr. Whimmer? It wouldn't have something to do with an undercover drug eradication operation down in the Cordillera region of Colombia oh, say, a dozen years back? I guess you can't answer that, either, can you? Would you guys like to tell me what you're doing in my home? If you don't mind. Not at all. Looking for evidence. Did you find any? We find any? Doesn't look like it. Oh, don't give up hope. You never know. Then again, if you don't find any, you can always plant some, right? I'm sure you're good at that. Who's the babe? She came with the frame. Really? I thought maybe she might've been somebody new in town. New client of your pal, Peter Mayhew. Oh, speaking of Mayhew's clients, we know you did Rabin and Bricklin. And Bishop, too. And those two cops. We know who you are, Blaine. Then why do you keep callin' me by all those other names? Hope you realize, Mayhew will break, and when he falls, you fall with him. You ever hear of client confidentiality? Have you ever heard of a lawyer whose ethics come before his own ass? Well, I don't wanna argue with you guys, and I don't wanna get in your way, so I'll go outside and wait till you're finished, all right? Damn it. Find any fingerprints? Just his, and one other set. Small hand, I think it was a woman. Okay, run 'em through. Maybe she can tell us. (paper crinkles) (phone rings) Yeah. [Charlie] Is this line clean? What's wrong, is she with you? No, she's not with me. That's only one of our problems now. The police know I work for you. (sighs) Jesus Christ. How'd they find out, she tell 'em? I don't know. What the hell's goin' on? I don't know. God, you just lie low, I'll take care of it, okay? - Okay? - Yeah, yeah I hear ya. All right. Aw, fuck. (ominous music) Shit. Fucking cops. It wasn't them. They left the place in picture-perfect shape. In fact, they were very orderly, considerate with your property. Of course, we still had to go ahead and have our little search. Picture perfect. Oh, no, no, don't worry about your gun, I found it. We're all professionals here, right? I mean, I've been in this situation myself. How about if I pay you triple whatever they're payin' you in cash right now. We can work this out, right? I mean. I'd like to help you, but you know how it is. You can't buy a reputation. Anyway, she's cuter than you are. She? 'Bout five seven, long brown hair, green eyes? That's the babe. Now, if you'll just move away from the window, we'll get this over with in about a second. (man groans) (gun fires) (gun fires0 (man groans) (gun fires) (man groans) (guns firing) (men groaning) (Charlie groans) (suspenseful music) Shit. (pants) You should've taken my offer. (Charlie groaning) (objects clatter) (Charlie groans) (speaks in foreign language), asshole. (man screams) (weapon thuds) (gun firing) (man hisses) Hey. I think he's dead now, man. Yeah, I think so. Hey, I told you I'd pay you back. (Charlie chuckles) Hey, you want me to get you to a hospital? No. My health insurance just ran out. Yours too, huh? Here. Buy your buddies some dinner. Thanks, man. I'll have to pay you back again, man. (ominous jazz music) (Charlie groaning) (Charlie grunts) (dog barks) (door beeps) (Charlie groans) (ominous music) (door thuds) (papers crinkle) Nice. (frame clatters) (printer whirs) Carlos DeCosta's widow. What a match for our friend. What do you say we pay the lady a visit and find out exactly what she's been up to lately. And maybe we'll find our guy there. (Charlie pants) (machine beeping) (safe clicks) (papers crinkle) (ominous music) Jordan. Aw, Jordan. I knew it was too good to be true. (chuckles) (phone beeps) (phone rings) [Peter] This is Peter Mayhew. I'm not available right now. If you need to leave a message, wait for the beep. (machine beeps) Peter. Elvis here. I just wanted to tell you I knew it was you that set the whole thing up. You and Bishop were partners in that $20 million Latin American deal until it went sour. You had to kill Jordan's husband, and then when she wanted revenge, you got a little greedy, didn't you, and you told her Bishop was one of the hitters. That was pretty smooth, buddy. Had me fooled. (chuckles) But Jordan never knew you were the one who paid for the whole thing. Well, that's the way it goes, huh? I think I'm gonna be taking that long vacation now, if you don't mind. I'll be seeing you around, buddy. (Peter sighs) (phone beeps) (phone rings) That you? (siren wails) (policemen chatter) (suspenseful music) (engine hums) (Charlie pants) (Charlie groans) Aw man, we worked on at least four of the homicides, all unsolved. How did he know we'd come here? Well he must've realized we'd lift her prints from his place. So? Why'd he leave us all this stuff? Well maybe the happy couple are having relationship difficulties, huh? Yeah. So where are they now? According to this, she has a house in Maui, a room at The Plaza in New York, and a place up in Mulholland. (ominous music) (Charlie groans) Oh my god, what happened to you? That's a good question. You've been shot. Yes, twice. But they missed the vital organs, you should've paid a few more dollars and got top-of-the-line, like when you hired me. What are you talking about? No more games, Jordan. No more lies. Please. You see, between you and me, I know everything now. - I'm so very... - That's far enough. (Jordan whimpers) It's proven to be very dangerous, letting you too close. Please, you have to calm down. I'm calm. I have to be in this line of work. Then again, I guess you know all about that. I found your little book, went in your safe and I saw everything. You didn't know who killed your husband, so you kept hiring hit men. (Charlie laughs) To kill another one. That's very, that's very good. But I don't understand the cop. I didn't know he was a crooked cop. [Charlie] Why did you hire him? I hired him to follow me. And stage that phony attempt so you would take the next job, which was him. You were gonna kill me. No, I wasn't. That was before I fell in love with you. (sobbing) I tried to call them off, I swear. Jordan. [Jordan] Yeah, but I couldn't contact them once they came after you. (whimpering) I love you. And I'm sorry. (ominous music) Oh, no! (gun fires) (Charlie groaning) (gun fires) Mayhew sends his regards. (gun fires) (Charlie screams) (gun firing) (man groaning) (water splashing) (gun thuds) (Jordan groans) You believe me, don't you? Yes, yes. (siren wails) (policemen chattering) Go, go, go, go! (dispatchers chatter) - Out of the car, Williams! - Move! Jesus Christ. What the hell is going on here? George, call for an ambulance. Get some back up, let's go, let's go. Come on, let's go. Somebody get up on the roof. [Dispatcher] Handle this call first. Thanks for the lead. One last question, though. What's your real name? Charlie. I didn't hear that. Charlie. Let's get Mayhew. We got enough on him already. Yeah. Then what? Puttin' us back to the old, boring homicides.
