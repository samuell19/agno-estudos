You got it? - Yes, yes. - How wonderful. - Who's there with you? Your mother, your sister, everyone! Dani, it's so great! Yes. If you want, I can check the Internet for a place in a decent neighbourhood. Or I could buy a ticket for next week and look for a place with you in Zurich. Yes, yes. - Dani? - What? Is something wrong? No. Tell me what's wrong. Are you okay? No, it's nothing. I'm going to be busy with work and I don't know. Maybe we should take it a bit more slowly. More slowly? Yes, it's important to me. And I need to give it my all. Fine, okay. Look, Dani, It's not the right time for this. Here's your mom. Call me tomorrow when you know what you want to say? Okay. - I really don't understand you. - Bye. - Daniel! - Hi, Mom. - How are you? - Fine, fine. Would you consider including another appetizer in the menu? I'm not convinced how well once we have now combined with the season and meat. - I changed the menu so I could make a decision. - Hey man how's it going? Today we have a new comer amongst us, Daniel. He is Spanish and I don't know, you want to say a few words? Well I want to say it's an honor to work here and that er. I will try not to disappoint the team. If you do, we can always fire you. Let me introduces you to Lukas, he's the maître. This is Nils, he manage the cold kitchen. And this is Hanna, our sommelier. This is Rita, Samuel, Paul, Pei and Jacob. And last but not least, Hugo. The head of the hot kitchen and my right hand man. He's Italian but no one's perfect. We have an important company dinner tonight. Hugo, I'm going to recommend they have the loin of venison, don't let me down, OK? Hanna, do we have that great Tuscan red? No, we've ran out, but I will find something else. Perfect! - Give me a hand. - Come on everyone, let's get to work. - So we have roast squab and wild mushroom. - Yes chef. - Sold with a Mexican roll. - yes chef. - Wrap Pali for two. - Yes chef. and Hugo, this one's for you. Filet mignon with Amerisauvignon. Yes chef. Come on guys, it should be ready by now. - add the salt - that's right, don't forget the salt. This is the wine I'd recommend for your meal. It's a French red wine. It goes well with your meal. Should I open it? Yes. - Remove the filet from the oven. - Yes chef. Nils, I still need the scallop Tatar. Hugo finish that off it's for table six. You're in charge now. Daniel. Filet mignon with smoke pumpkin. Me? Filet, mignon, with smoke, pumpkin. Yes chef. Wait, wait, wait. Not bad. But the sauce can't touch the beef. And the presentation should not overshadow the dish itself. That will do for now. Hugo will help you if you, just ask him if you need anything. OK, thank you. What a jerk! Are you ok? Did you see that guy?! It looked really bad, are you really ok? Ya, ya, I'm ok, I'm ok. Welcome to Switzerland. I'm Hanna. Daniel. By the way, do you know if the... Tramp stop is that way or that way? I don't remember. It depends which tramp do you need. Where do you live? I'm..I'm going to Ambrutraser. What? Ambrutrasep. Am..bru..tra..ser. I don't know where that is. Are you staying in hotel? No, no, I'm living near the theatre museum. Afukhausen. Ya, ya, that one, that one. Ay, are you flirting with my friend? Come on let's grab a drink. So you want to come for a welcome drink? Or do you have any other plans? Oh well, I've got tons of plans here in Switzerland but maybe I can change them. Let's go. I love this place. Someday I'll open a place like this, with no pressure, no critic, no money interest. And of course some quiet spot... the sea. Your hometown is by the sea, no? No, no, no, but not far away. Oh, too bad, I love the beach. Yeah, not surprised, German beaches are really famous. Ya, Ok, it's been a very long time since I've been to the beach but, I miss it. I love just sitting and... gazing out to sea. Love is not like sex, there's no meaning with sex. Ya, ya, ya. But I was talking about sex, what's love got to do with it. Well I mean love is just something chemical that your body releases. At tops, it last three years. Three, its mathematical. Then it suddenly, poof... ends. You get over it and you realize that your with somebody who belongs to the past, who no longer has any relevance to you. You're fond of them but it's no longer, it's over. You're there but you're not there. It's like that. OK, wait... I think, that's got to be the most romantic thing I ever heard. OK, 99 percent of time, love is a lot crap, I give you that, ya it screws you up. You can choose who you fall in love with. Ya, and that's it, and we always fall in love with the biggest bastards, true. But if it works out. What, what? This conversation is over. I'm gonna pay. Can I have the check? She's great, we had like this very big relationship. A week. We didn't connect we're just too similar you know, she needs someone else. And why are you telling me this? You want another drink? - No. I'm going home, it's late. - OK, I think I'm going to stay awhile longer. No I think I'm going to end, a little bit tired. - OK. - Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Oh, by the way, sorry about the crap I came out with before. Ah, don't worry, you just sound like typical guy hiding behind the cynicism. I thought I was the one with the stupid theories. So which one was it? Your girlfriend cheated on you or your parents divorce when you were a child? Both. No, it's just that life isn't seen in the movies you know. All nice and all perfect and the... You mean when, like when two people are talking and then, wham, All of a sudden they start kissing? Ya. And their life is much more complicated. Things like that never happen. I only kiss you because I want to contradict you. Oh, your argument was really persuasive? I just wanted to give you a kiss, and then things gone a little bit out of hand. Absolutely. This is my place. OK. No. Erm... I mean. Oh. Sorry, sorry, I misunderstood, sorry. Don't worry, Good night. See you tomorrow. Great timing, great timing. Thanks. - Yes? - Eva? Dani? What time is it? It's a little late. Can you talk? - What's wrong? Are you alright? - Yes. Everything's fine. I just felt like talking to you. Dani, its pretty late. I don't think now's the time to talk. Sure, right. We'll talk tomorrow. Yeah, sure. - Kiss - Good Bye What? Keep studying big boy, I'll test you later. So how's it coming along? Fine, fine. What's going on? Nothing. She's the architect of the London premises. We open in London at the end of summer and Thomas is agonizing over the project. The truth is this London business is making him unbearable. Ay, Hugo... Thomas and Hanna... are they together? Yeah, she's his lover for a... a year more or less. Why? You got the hearts for Thomas? His a bit old for you, isn't he? - Keep working baby. - Ya. I need plating for the appetizers. Yes chef. Yes chef. I am going for a wander up in the dining room Remember the lobster have already been steamed. - Daniel! - Yes. I don't have time, you manage the lobster. OK? Yes, yes of course. - It's fine. - Wait. - What? - Nothing. What's up? A touch of pennon, some fresh berries, what it needs? No Dani, it doesn't suit the dish, leave it as it is. Hugo, Hugo. Ok, if it's too dry, Thomas will pay more attention. Do what the hell you like, ok. But don't push your luck. Come on. They praise your lobster. Well done. So, you wanna go and have a drink somewhere else? No I think I'm going home. I will go with you. No, no. To be honest I rather go alone. See you tomorrow. Listen, can I ask you what is wrong with you? It's because of Thomas and me isn't it? No it's not that it's... It's ok no problem. It's just I'm tired. No you're not, you're angry with me. Are you like this because of what happened yesterday? No. Just it is business was just... Foonkalington Fookalinkgton... what's this? Imagine that you and I get involved. More involved. And then what? It's better for both of us that nothing happened. Believe me. What are you talking about? I'm just trying to be as unpleasant as possible. So do leave me alone. And, a little bit confused you know. Listen. I'm sorry. Sorry that I kissed you that was really stupid of me. But. I'm in love with Thomas and I'm not in the habit of telling a guy who I only met twice. Who I do or don't go out with. And especially not when it is with my boss. Our boss. I have an idea. To make it up to you. I invite you home and you cook me dinner. What do you say? You have a strange way of making things up to people. So, friends? You and me? I don't think so. Come on. I know what you're thinking that I am a disaster. I haven't had time to clean up much lately. Where's the next bit? It's a story right? What are you doing? Don't tell me you're reading it, it's terrible. What happened with the body of the fish? Where's the rest? Nowhere it's a never-ending story. I let you choose the wine. Surprise me. Ok. Hey, don't look. Ok. Why do you use paper napkins? It's a real mess. By the way over there are your ingredients. So We have Noodles Two eggs and half an orange. I don't cook much for myself. This is the only part of my body that is worth something. The first encounter is strong. The grapes slightly dry. From the soil. Earthy but sweet at the same time. And. Wait. Now you can learn to taste the body of the wine. With a slight after taste of oak. Do you like it? A lot. This is why. Because it is a good '86 Ribera Del Dijero Other people were gravely injured in the pile-up. Amazing. That's the best bottle of Spanish wine I have in the house right now Sorry, that was the one for special occasion? Let's make this one special. Ya, why not? So are you cooking me dinner or do I have to get you drunk first? But with this I cannot do anything. Dani that's life. We all can do things we are born with it. There's no use in saying that I can't do anything with this. Bet you have to improvise. Ok, here it goes. So, we have. Noodles. Two eggs. An orange, half an orange. And Mint sweets. Voila! Noodles with orange And, wait. Wait! Mint sweets. Bon appétit. Do you hear the story of a guy who jumps from a four story building and didn't kill himself. So he gets on a taxi to drive him to a higher building. What a story is that? So He jumped And broke, I don't know... Two ribs and an arm something like that. So he gets in a taxi and look around for a better place to jump from. And on the way the taxi driver crashes and he was killed. But, who? The suicide? No, the taxi driver. The other one was unhurt. And by the way the guy was a chef. - Really? - Ya, Japanese. They did it because they dropped the star from his restaurant and the CS guide. Irony was it was a printing error. No. And you have to be a real idiot to want to kill yourself for something like that. It's important to you isn't it? What is? Recognition, being somebody. That's why you came to Zurich isn't it? That guy didn't try to kill himself because of one star more or less. He did it because he had no one to talk to I guarantee it. And that is the real sad thing. I guess it's pretty late. It's only five in the morning. Yeah may be I should go. Yeah may be you should. Hello? Hi it's me. Look up. I thought we can keep on talking while you on your way home. I'm warning you I'm not hanging up until you tell me how you made the spaghetti. By the way. Do you think you can improvise something with tuna fish and cookie? I should teach you how to cook. Yea I know Hugo tried it once but I was a crap student. Oh, did he? What? What, what? What did you mean by, oh did he? Nothing. Come on. He told you we were dating. No! No. Come on. OK, yes You know another thing between Hugo and me is a bit Difficult because Hanna. Hanna, I cannot hear you. I'm sorry I just said that it's a little bit special between Hugo and me because Love... Sex... Magic..but... I think I may have got lost. But aren't you anywhere near your apartment? Shit What? This place is Incredible. Describe it to me. I'm not very good at that. Come on. Well. I don't know here I am in the middle of nowhere and the city, its seems to be sleeping. and what else and the sun is slowly warming the streets and..erm... the silence the best thing is the silence Daniel, there's something I'd like to tell you but I don't know if I should? I'm pregnant... and I don't know what to do. What did you say? Erm, I think it's better if we talk later oh, no, no, no, just when things were getting interesting, now. Aye... I didn't know that German could sound so sexy keep talking Idiot! Idiot? Retard! Retard? Retard. Mega-retard. Oh! that sounds great Dimwit! And another time Idiot. Yes, very good, perfect And now you add a touch of pink pepper No, not too much OK Plate it again Thank you Hey! Don't forget, tonight is my birthday buddy. I want you treat yourself into a oblivion Like any normal person Got it? - Hugo! - Ya. Have you spoken to Nils? I've told you last weekend I wanted him out His hopeless dealing with the suppliers The goods they've sent couldn't be any worst Ya, but he has family issues Sister's in bad shape doctors and stuff, maybe... That's not our problem - Keep him - That's final! I want him out Tell him... that's your job. I'm not doing it. I'm not like that Maybe it's my job but its stinks. Very well. I'll speak to him. If you're not going to do your job I don't need you. Take the day off, think it over and come back tomorrow. Tell me when you finished with the salmon Hey where is the garnish for the mushroom? The sauce. Yes chef. Perfect. I need plates and trays for the appetizers. Ok, perfect. Now you get on the red mullet? OK chef Great. Daniel, the lobster has already been stewed. I'm stepping out for a second. I need the appetizers for four. Number four, service. Gotcha. You know what scares me the most about people who is such perfectionist? That one day they break under stress grabbed a machine gun to work and... You can laugh. Shame Hugo wasn't here to see it. You coming to Hugo's party tonight? I know I can't go in the end. I have arranged to meet Thomas; I have to talk to him. Are you ok? Can I help? No, it's between him and me. Hanna please. Hey you know what? You should tell him to get lost. Let me show you if it work. If it works you can set up on your own. No problem. Come on, have fun. Hey, big boss. - How are you? - I'm fine Do you want a drink? Nope, I want three, martini mangoes. Sweetie, I can't talk right now. I have to go back inside. I'll call you back in a few hours, okay? Hey, give the boy a kiss from me? Bye. Thanks for the evening. It was really... I love you. And this? What could it be? Well... Well, it looks like a gift. In Khajuraho there's a little temple where they use items like this as sacrificial offerings. What do you think? India? Just the two of us, for a whole month next summer. It's just what you wanted, isn't it? It's really great. But what I want is you. And now. Why don't we drive up to Bavaria for a few days next week? Hanna! Do you know how hard it is just to come here? The excuses I have to come up with. We've talked it over. I told you from the very beginning it'd be like this. There'd be certain conditions. I can't give you more. Do you know how many trips you've cancelled at the last minute? - This time it will be different! - You said that last time too. Jeez, I don't want to hide anymore. I want to be with you. - You need to see what I'm going through. - I do! No, you don't. And it doesn't matter. What are you doing? Running away. And then you'll call me in tears at 5 am when I'm laying next to my wife. You'll do that, won't you? You're such a bastard! Sorry. Hanna! What are you trying to prove to me? Hanna! Hanna, please. Open up. Hanna! Hanna! Okay. I'm sorry, okay? Hanna! Are you alright? Hi Dani. How do you feel? Never felt better. Where's Thomas? Thomas, uhmm. He... What a bastard. Well, women to fall in love always with bastards. No? That's all I needed to hear. Hanna. The baby is fine. Dani can you please leave me alone. What happened? Nothing. I fainted. You better go. I don't know what to say, I will help you but... I don't know how. It certainly not your strong point you're a disaster. I don't know maybe you could... You could write about it. Get it out of your system. No? Stop it. Will you stop it? Are you crazy? Maybe you should write about it, get it out of your system Is that all you can think of? This place depresses me. Let's get out of here. But, you are feeling ok? Ya. And you think that you. We can get out of here like this? You mean without the permission of he hospital director? Yes, I don't know? Me neither. In the movies they always run. Ok. Let's run. - This way - Here he is. - We're going on a trip, we're going on a trip. - Hey, Hugo thanks for coming. - Come Hugo, drive, drive, drive. - I'm not moving. Can someone tell me what's going on? Everything's ok. She's pregnant. What? This is fantastic. Give me a hug. But why you didn't tell me before? Because I was scared. It's all over. Today. Was a pretty day. No disappointment, No expectations on your whereabouts And oh, did I let you go? Did it finally show that strange things will happen if you let them? Today I didn't even try to hide I'll stay here and never push things to the side You can't reach me cause I'm way beyond you today When I was a kid I had an accident much worse than that. Really? Ya but it was nothing. I was seventeen running a crappy moppet and a car hit me. Came, from the left. I swerve it out from the corner of my eye. And the time stops. And I swear to god. I thought I'm gonna die. And that's not fair you know. Your time to think that? Yea you're bet. Remember thinking like Bloody hell I'm I'm seventeen I can't die because I'm still a virgin you know. What? Yeah. I flew off the bike And I bounced on the lamppost. In the end I only have two broken ribs but The next day I left the hospital and said ok Now I have to ---- someone. - Sorry. - No, seriously I mean. I thought like right now I could be dead. Tomorrow I die. And that's what life is. That's such a sad story. Yes it is. And that explains so much. Come here. Poor thing. So where are we? I think that we are 50 kilometers from Lyon. We are in France. - Yes. - Let's see. We're about 600 kilometers from Bilbao. No, no, no, no, no, I don't feel like going there. We can go to Marseille it is much closer. We can go somewhere else but not Bilbao. I don't fancy running to the same old people. Assholes! - Mum! How's the hake coming along? - Really good. If only you had told me the day before, I could've made cod. Yummy. - Yes, but hake with clams is yummy, too. - You're right. - I'm so glad you came. - Me, too, Mum. Give me a kiss. Are you going to call Eva? Hey, you know best what you're doing... Mum, for the two days I'm here, let's try to get along. - Alright. - Should I chop up the parsley? Sure, a little bit. What about the restaurant? - Are you happy? - Yes. It's hard work and complicated. But I'm doing well. - Dani. - Yes? Switzerland might be great and all, but if you're not happy, come back. - You don't have to prove anything. - I'm not. I'm happy. It's alright. - And the oil? Where is it? - Why are you looking there? Over here. You changed the spot. Change! You're the one who's changed. Do you like clams? Clam. You sly fox. - What did you tell him? - It was a joke. It's because here - the word for clam... - Don't, Mum. Come on! It has a second meaning. Yes, yes. Referring to... Yes, sure, but don't translate it! - Shall we make a toast? - Sure. - Alright. - Let's toast. Oh, there you are. I saw you. I can't concentrate. This guy doesn't sing right. I'm not Pavarotti! You don't sound Italian and you sing horribly. Sorry. I do, too. Okay. Bye. Are you coming? My mother is a bit merry and I don't think anybody can shut her up. No thanks. I'm going to bed I'm tired. Bed? But now is when the fun starts. We have to hit the town. I don't know. You know you're really lucky. Why? Your family. You can tell they love you. They're wonderful. What about your father? He lives in Madrid and we don't see much of each other. And that's it? That's all you gonna tell me? If you come out with me I will tell you everything. Ok. He runs off with a younger woman when I was 10. And I know he's doing alright at his job. He got married again. But he never wanted to do anything with us. So if you're a rich and famous chef you gonna go and rub money in his face? That's probably gonna be a little complex. Oh, that hurt. By the way this is my friend Hugo. Give me two. Eva! What are you doing here? Did something happen? No, nothing happened. I came to see my mother. I was going to call you. And then I thought it'd be better to call you tomorrow to talk with more time and... You're an asshole. Eva! - Eva, listen. - You knew it right from the start, huh? And I was the idiot here, thinking we still had something going. - Eva! - What, Dani? What? It's all over for you, isn't it? Then say it! Have the balls to say it finally, Dani! You knew perfectly well it wasn't working out between us. I knew it, too. How can you say that to me? Do you love me? Eva, I know I might not have done it the right way, but this job rushed things along. I promise you... I thought a lot about the two of us... - I couldn't know it'd happen. - I'm asking you if you love me. Okay. This is where you say, "No, Eva. I don't love you. I stopped loving you ages ago, but I didn't have the guts to tell you." Hey where were you? - I'm leaving. - What? Hugo. Can I borrow your car? - What? - Why? Your car, can I borrow? Yes sure. Where are you going? I'm going with you. I did everything wrong. Do you love her? Not anymore. And you? What will you do with your baby? I rather not think about it. Sometimes I feel like it's not there. That doesn't exist. I just want to hold on to life and see what it happens. I don't know. Really I don't. Let's get back to the car you frozen stiff. Thanks. Yes? He needs to see me. I told him about the baby and he says it changes everything. And you believe him? I have to believe it. For now. He's lying to you, but. It doesn't matter because you love him. Do you love him? Ok. I'm sorry. Really I am. - I wish I met you before all this. - Yeah, but you met me now. Dani I'm having Thomas baby. You can have that guy's baby and he doesn't give a shit about you. If you're in love you would understand me. - Starting on table four. - Yup, ok. What an asshole bringing his wife here. - Somebody hurry and bring this soup out there. - Ok. I haven't seen him since his last visit to London. How is he? Francis is doing much better. Thank you Hanna it won't be necessary you bring us the chateau blanc. May I recommend that madam try one of our California chardonnay? - Mr Wackerle loves... - I think he prefers something really whisky? A Riesling maybe? I'm afraid we are all out. Pity. Well then suggests something else dear. What a bastard I can't believe it. Hugo can you pass the risotto off please. Coming. Are you ok? Sorry I don't feel like talking right now. Ok. Hanna please waits. Rita I need the desserts for table six now! Thomas we're done with the kitchen. Glass of wine? Did you know she was pregnant? She used to speak a lot about you. I told her it wasn't the right time. That's all. We can have children in the future. But right now. It would be a liability. The money safe has to be organized. Do you want me to take care of it? I just want to be with her. No plans. Just to be with her. I'm tired, tired of being me. Hanna was right. Sometimes I need to stop being Thomas Wackerle. And be plain old Thomas again. It must be hard being a rich and famous chef. I've been thinking about the London restaurant. You can develop your talent there. Try new things. I won't be there to clip your wings. If you're interested in ruining your life. Let me know. Hello Daniel. In the end you are right. Thomas is not going to change. I think our story ended a while ago. I was stupid to think that things will change. Since we returned from the trip you haven't felt he need to speak to me. I've been feeling very alone. I can't go on like this. I think it make no sense for me to stay here. I'm tired. I'm going back home to Munich. I need to be on my own. Start over find my place. I'm sorry for not saying goodbye. But I think its better this way. You're late. It's the last time I'll do your job. You go and help Peter. You did a great job yesterday. Thank you, Daniel. Thomas. Thomas. Sorry I got you mixed up. Why don't you get on with the orders? Main course at table 10. Risotto and the extra truffles now! - Hugo goes and plates it. - Yes coming. I want to grab it when I get back. Risotto is going to spoil. Come on Hugo! The sauce. Asparagus! Get back! - What the ---- are you doing man? - You are taking forever to finish your ---- dish. Listen, was it too long I take? I tell you what to do. Touch my dish once again and I will break your neck. Where are the eggs? What's going on Hugo? Where's the dish? Did you leave your brain at home or what? For months now you have been unfocused Maybe all of these are too much for you. Why don't you take a break? Hugo are you listening to me? I want you to stop! You're the boss it is up to you. But if I go now I might not be back in two weeks. Alright back to work everyone. Daniel get that order ready it should be on the table by now! Hey Hugo. Well, well. The new guy. Hey don't do this. Don't do what? Humiliate you? I couldn't have known this gonna happen ok? No it's not ok. Ok stop. - Let's go take a beer and talk, come on. - Talk about what? It's been months since we talk about any bloody thing! What you wanna talk about? London? I can speak with Thomas to persuade him to let you come back. You speak with Thomas? This is unbelievable. Look I'm the one who walked out. Speak with who? What do you want? Tell me what do you want. Turns out you're not a brilliant chef. But an idiotic guy who make friends with the boss. Shut your ---- mouth you don't know what you are talking about. Now you gonna stay here and get a piece of my mind if you are a man. What? Know the difference between me and you ass. I make mistakes and I always regret every ---- time! And what do you do? What do you do? Nothing. Nothing. What about Hanna? - Are you going to tell Thoma..? - Shh! Are you going to tell Thomas everything hat's going on between you? You're going to tell me that he was a bastard? Or would you just keep your ---- mouth shut. Because you want to move to London. That's what he wanted isn't it? I'm just another step of the ladder. Your success ladder. But it's not my way of success. I'm off. Be happy If you can. Hugo. Hugo! Daniel, I spoke with the decorator and told him That when you go to London, you'll pick the design for the posters. Ok don't worry. I need this for table 7. - Hey keep an eye on this. - Ok. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Look at this. - Are they alike? - No. Ok we start again. Very expensive. As you can see it is divided into regions. We got the French wine, Italians - California's - I see you got a very wide collection. Quite impressive. Hey what are you doing here? It's your day off. Yea I came to pick up some stuff. Thomas. Remember tomorrow we have a meeting with the London supplier. Yea, ok. So see you tomorrow. Ya, see you tomorrow. It's smaller but it's ok. Less stress. It's cozier, they let me play around with the menu. Try new things take risks. Things that I almost forgotten about. Actually I was looking for a place like this. Chop these please. I'm really sorry about what happened. - Daniel just forgets about it. - No, no, no. I'm really sorry. I'm sick of being that way, you know? And other things that happened to me. - All at the same time. - You are scared. Scared to make the right decisions. Hanna? Dani? Hi, how are you? Fine. Fine. What a surprise to be honest. I really want to speak to you. I would love to talk to and I'm at the point of ringing a lot of time. You may not believe it, but. So have I. And why wouldn't I believe it? I wouldn't know what to begin Well in the end we have done it. I miss you. Me too Hanna. I like to see you. Yes, so was I. I'm in Munich. What? You're crazy. Yeah, I'm in Munich. - Really? - Yeah? Hanna. You're very Pregnant. And beautiful. Don't lie, I'm huge. No. This is the nicest thing about the apartment. What? She kicked me. Always calling attention to herself when we have a party going on. It's a girl. Nola. Can you feel her? Not yet. This is Daniel. Say hello. - It's a good trick isn't it? - Yes. It's cold. Let's get inside. It's awful being hungry all the time. Do you want to finish mine? Yes. I'm going to be a professional fatty. I can't even tie my shoes anymore I really miss it. How are things at the restaurant? I'm leaving. What? I have given it up. I don't know what to explain but Tomorrow I won't be there or London or anywhere. I'm giving it up. I don't know what I will do but. Definitely. I'm giving it up. And how do you feel? Fine, fine. Beautiful. I love you. Thank you. It's been a long time since anyone said that to me. And meant it. Dani. I don't love you. What is wrong with you Hanna? I don't know what the hell you want? Please let's talk calmly. What do you want us to talk about? I love you. You don't love me. That's all. Please don't go. I can't let you go like this. I don't bloody understand you Hanna. It's not that easy. What do you think that I wouldn't like to love you? It's just that. I don't, I can't. It doesn't happen for me. I know that you love me it's so nice, but. I don't want to go there because I know that we'll end up hurting each other. It doesn't matter. I love you. And. I could stay with you. Take care of you. Dani. I'm alone because right now I want to be alone. I can't be with anyone. I'm not ready yet. Dani. Dani. She's coming. - I think she's on her way. - What? Dani. Stay with me please. Don't go. Everything will be all right. - Do you hear me? Everything will be fine. - I'm scared. Give me your hand. Come on give me your hand. Breathe and trust me. Let's go, let's go. Everything will be fine. Just a little bit. Hi Hanna. I have organized your stories. I'm sure someday Lola will love them. Now I know I don't belong here. You have your place. With Lola. And I need to find mine. I thought of opening up a little restaurant. At a really nice place near the sea. Remember. If someday you want to see me you know where I will be. I'm going to miss you. Thank you Hanna. Thanks for everything.
