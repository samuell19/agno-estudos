Well, it gets complicated, I mean, they've got parental controls that block certain websites. The Internet is getting scarier. Honey, you have no idea. What are you listening to? Ugh, Switchfoot again? Come on, it beats the stuff you listen to. W-well what do you mean? Green Day rules. H-hey guys what do you think? Green Day or Switchfoot? Switchfoot's for altar boys.

Well, Alex went to bed early, probably has homework he didn't want to finish, and Justin's in his room? you know, this would be a great time to have that little talk with him. What talk? Ugh, about the stuff I saw on the computer? Oh sweetheart, what am I supposed to say about that? You're the dad, I'm sure you'll think of something. Multitasking? What? What's up? I got a lot of math homework. Yeah. Right. Okay. your uh, your mom was uh, up late couple of nights ago and she saw some pictures on your computer. U-uh, um, I'm real sorry about that. It won't happen again, I promise. I mean, it's normal to? look all guys want to look at pictures. When I was your age, we used to hide our Playboys under the bed. Yeah? But uh, you know, relationship's about more than just sex. Your mom was, beautiful when I met her. I mean she still is but, w-w-what we share, it's not just physical. You know w-we uh we just enjoy each other's company. This make any sense to you? No. Sounds like mom sent you in here. No, it's, it's me too. She's worried that there might be a problem. No, no, dad, geez, there's no problem. I mean you said it yourself. All guys do it. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I told her. It's nothing to worry about? so, how's practice anyway, huh? It's great. Well? No problem. What does that mean? I told him there's more to life than big boobs. You're kidding, right!? I said relationships are about more than sex. I brought up how we share the joys and heartaches that invariably come your way in life. Should I be writing this down? I, I know you're concerned but he's a regular teenage boy. He's got to look at this stuff, then he moves on. It's normal. Okay Alright everybody, listen up. Listen up! The meet is this weekend! So you know the drill, right? Three R's! Rest, relaxation, and restraint. Alright, now. Who's the best? We are! That's right, yes we are. Alright, get out of here! Hey! Whatcha doin with my PDA?

Call her on the phone. Sure that'll work just as well. Alex? what's going on? Um, h-he's all pumped up. He just defeated the drug dealer in Grand Theft Auto. Nice. It's pretty cool. The Founding Fathers didn't talk about religion. But, they were men of faith. Washington too? Yep. He prayed. "Oh most glorious God, may we each know what is acceptable in thy holy word." You know, I think it's tight that you're not afraid to talk about your faith. Yeah? Most kids don't think so. Who cares? I respect it. So, will I ever get you to come to church with me? You never know. What's it do for you? I don't know. I guess it puts things in perspective. It comforts me. Makes all that stupid stuff we obsess about seem? stupid. Yeah. It's cool. You know you're alright, for a scrawny righteous sophomore virgin. Dude, I'm not scrawny. Seriously dude, Angel Girl's nice and everything, but datting, dude nobody dates! You know what you need? What every other slacker in his life needs. A little bit of Monica. Wow, heh, she definitely is hot. Have you and Monica done it... We, no No, it'd be a little too weird with Dooley, but you, you could. Serious? Yeah, she's sick of him! And you're smart. Now get educated. Get Monica. Yeah. Monica. Hey. Hey. I just shot down three more Nazi planes. It's boring making these every day! Yeah, I'm sick of that game too. Wanna see something really gross? What? Thomas, you've got to promise not to tell anyone, because if my brother caught me he'd kill me. What? I promise, I won't tell anyone. Why don't you snipe him? Can't, thing's not working. Hey, I found this pretty extreme website last night. It's pretty extreme, dude. Another multiplayer game? No man, something a lot hotter. Go for it. Oh man, get that crap off my computer, I'm gonna get spam forever! But you've got to check out this babe with the huge? No, come on, dude, no, I don't care, bro. That stuff's way too twisted! Sorry, man. This is a nice surprise. Wanna join me? No, I just, um, got to, finish my homework in Study Hall, so... just came down to see if you were still working out. Would you hand me my towel? Thanks. So what's going on? N-no, not much. That was a pretty decent last fifty. You should've seen me in college. Did something happen today? No. Why? You seem upset about something. No, I, just got a bad headache. Prolly cuz I didn't eat lunch today. Nice. Okay I'm gonna go get changed and um... Let's go pick up some takeout food for dinner. How's that sound? Sounds good, yeah. Yeah? Thank you. Yeah, right. Where's Alex today? Book report due. Hasn't read the book. Justin, your heat's up! Justin, gimmie that, c'mon! What are you doing? Nothing, I'm just? Great! Ugh!

Watch out! You're almost at the turn, go, go! Don't you quit on me, Peterson, let's go. Come on, you can do it, pick it up! Coming in at third place, Justin Peterson! He ran out of gas! He wasn't ready to race. You know what guys? Yeah, I'm really not that hungry, okay? Come on, All-State, I mean cheeseburger, vanilla shake, I mean that is true happiness! I think Justin just blew the one-hundred cuz he knew he'd be looking at my ass in the finals! Probably! I'm gonna go snag a table. We don't have to do this, we can just go eat at my place. N-no, I'm just, I'm gonna head home, you hang out here with Nolan, alright? I-I'll come with you! N-n-no, hey, I'm really beat, I'll call you later, okay? He can't afford to screw up like this. College coaches are aware of him, you know you never know when one of em'll show up at a meet. I know! He's got one shot! One! Swimming. C-college is, Justin's only chance at a good college is in the pool. You know, maybe we need to consider the fact that he's not like you. OK? He can't, under pressure, respond like you? Oh, he's better than I was, he's faster, he's stronger. T-there's something else going on that I just, I can't talk to him. Well, you want me to talk to him? Didn't do much good the last time! Thanks! Well, huhuh? You know what I think? What? I think you're pushing him way too hard to be like you. Oh, I am not. Let him be who he wants to be! We can afford some college! Some college? Why not? I'm working my butt off to make? So am I? ? money so that both the boys will have opportunities? SO AM I, STEVEN! But it's never gonna be enough, for even some college. Did you make those reservations for San Francisco? No. Don't. We can't afford it and, now's not the time to go away, so? Yes! Can I go to bed now? No. But I have a geography test tomorrow. You'll sit here until your brother gets home. And he better have an explanation. Like what? "Virgin Vaginas" are a new band? What's going on? Your mother found this in Alex's room. What is it? Porn! Did he get it off your computer? Did he say that? Doesn't matter what he said! We're asking you! There's a bunch of guys at school rattling me... I mean, you know, cuz me and Amy are so conservative about having sex and stuff. Yeah? So? So they send me these pictures! Which guys? I don't know exactly. It was a bunch of em, they did it as kind of a joke. A joke!? You think sending, porn is a JOKE!? It's garbage Justin, and I don't want it in my house, EVER, you understand!? Yes. However you got it, either your brother found it himself or you showed it to him,... ...which I hope to God, you didn't do? I found it. You found it? On accident. I'm sorry, mom. Alright, go to bed. Listen, these friends that send you this crap? Those friendships are over! Yes, dad. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. What do you think? Well, I don't think he's lying. I believe him! You don't believe him? Oh, hi, huhuhuh, oh my God did we have a lunch meet and I forgot to write it down? Oh, no, no, I just thought I'd give it a shot. You free? Grading freshman book reports is my lunch. Well, another time I'd just um, I needed some advice about something, so? Well, I've got a sec. Um, what's up? I don't really, remember the details, and, and it's, it's none of my business, okay... ...but uh, um, didn't you break up with Tom over something to do with uh, Internet porn? Oh my God, is Steven? No, no. It's Justin. Yeah. My marriage was destroyed, because of his addiction to Internet porn. You gotta go! I'm sure this is like, some silly teenage stuff No, Di, we've got to talk more about this. And you have got to monitor his computer. Yeah? Got it. Thanks, see you later. Alex! Thanks, honey. No problem. Heh, yeah, not for you. Mom? you know we can get around the software, right? What do you mean, does it work? Oh no, it's fine, for some people, it's just that me and Justin are good with computers. Not that we would try and get it around it or anything, I'm just saying that? I-I'm sure you won't, especially if we move the computer into the family room! What about when you're not home? Well, guess the power cord goes with me! Hey! Hey, how are ya! Fine. Sorry I took off last night. Yeah. I was worried about you. You know, a bunch of us are at the diner if you wanna come over! Um, can I call you later? That's what you said last night. Now's not a good time. Why are you being so weird to me? Look, I'll call you later.I promise. Bye. That's cool. Why don't we rent a movie tonight? We haven't done that in ages. Yeah. That sounds good. That'd be great mom. I can't math test, I-I promised Amy I'd come over tonight and do some work. Do it over the phone.

He would stay up all night and watch that stuff? But he couldn't bear to touch me! The real thing lying in the next room. I don't want to scare you, I mean this was a big thing for me I'm sure? Justin's just going through a phase. Don't all teenage boys do this? I don't know. Am I gonna see you this weekend? Yeah, if you still want to. Yeah, I just thought,I dunno...

Apparently one of his teachers caught Thomas showing off a pornographic photo on his laptop. Well, I didn't send it to him! No, your brother did. I did not.. ALEX, DON'T LIE TO ME! It was sent from your e-mail. You're, lucky you didn't get suspended. Why are you looking at me? Because you allowed this pornography into our house. Justin, I need you to look at me! I mean it! LOOK at me! You have a? problem with pornography. No, Dr. Phil, I don't. A-Alex, go get me a, a couple of bags of plant growth. Mom, I? NOW! Beth went through this with her husband Tom. She gave me a lot of insight into this kind of addiction, it ruined her life? Y well, t-that' s nice mom. This isn't like, some sneak-a-peek innocent kind of guy stuff, you, t-this is different and you know it is? Well I'm not Beth's husband, okay mom? I know that. But, let me help you? I don't have a problem with pornography! I swear, I'm telling you the truth! OK, I don't have a problem! Good. Because I'm shutting off Internet access. Well no mom you can't do that, I have homework assignments and class notes off the Web! And what about e-mails? Use the library computers at school. You and I are gonna have a talk in the car. Nice going you stupid dork! Steven, d-do you... Ever need to fantasize about? Porn? Other women? Honey, I'm one of the lucky guys. I married my fantasy. But every year I get a little, older, a little... less sexy and, as a fantasy to you I'm sure? Listen to me. You fulfill all my fantasies. Not just the sexual ones. My problem is I don't tell you that enough. N-no, but I think Tammy Carson has a [???] somewhere. Sorry, I'm still new at this thing. Um, I can't find it I'm gonna have to call you back. Justin. You forgot something on my PDA. I don't know how that got there. DON'T LIE TO ME, PLEASE! What's happened to you!? What's going on, man? HEY, GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!

I-I'll be right there. Is everything okay? Di, what is it, what's wrong? Justin hacked through the library firewall. Of course this means he won't be allowed to use the school computers until further notice. Why, are you suspending him? No but, he's put on probation for the rest of the school year. And he has detention for the next, four Saturday mornings. Well I think that's, more than fair. I have a, a copy of Justin's progress report. Why didn't the school tell us his grades were slipping? We sent a copy of the report home, and we e-mailed it. Look, Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, have um.. ...have either of you ever caught Justin visiting porn sites? No! I mean? he's looked at some pictures? Yes I've, I've, caught him looking at um, porn sites at home. Well Justin was visiting porn sites on the library's computer. Look he's, he's not the only student with this type of problem. Since all this new technology makes the Internet so incredibly accessible, pornography addiction has become far more common If you want some help I have a list of therapists you might want to contact. Thanks. I think we can take care of it. Actually, I, I'd really appreciate that list Let's go. Now. Can't, I have practice. No you don't, you've been suspended from the team.

I WAS LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY, IS THAT WHAT YOU GUYS WANNA HEAR? I can stop. Well, I don't think it's gonna be that easy, Justin. But I know I can do it. Justin, you're gonna need professional help dealing with this. Mom, no! And, there are consequences for what happened at school. You're grounded for the rest of the semester. I understand. Hello? Who is it? Uh, i-it's Justin! 'Swimmer'? Come on in, I won't bite. So do you want something to drink, or? Oh no I'm fine, thanks. Wow, this is nice. Uh, don't sound so surprised, I might get the wrong impression. What do you mean? That you think I'm a cheap slut from a low-rent family. Oh no no, I don't think that at all? Relax. I'm just teasing you. Let's go upstairs. Wouldn't you um, rather be in your room? No. This is exactly where I want to be. I could tell you wanted to be with me that first time we met. Really? Yeah but then you left me so quickly the other night? Oh no, no, it wasn't you, it just, well, I had this paper due. Well what about now? Do you have to be anywhere else?
