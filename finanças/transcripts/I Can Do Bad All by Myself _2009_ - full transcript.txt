I don't see no reason for you to call the cops or-- You don't tell me not to call the cops. If I want to call the cops, I'm gonna call the cops. I might not call them if you done learned your lesson. The lesson is simple, honey. You can ask people for stuff. You ain't got to be breaking in their house trying to steal nothing. I'm feeding you out of the kindness of my heart. I'm doing the good Christian thing. I'm doing what Jesus would've did right now. I'm feeding you. My daughter will be so proud of me. Feeding the people that came in here trying to steal from me. All of this stuff going on in the world, I can help y'all if you ask me to help you. You ain't got to come breaking in the house. Hell, people are struggling, working hard for what the hell they got, and you gonna break up in somebody's house. [bangs hand on table] What the hell wrong with y'all?

Manny, can you just shut up and eat your food, please? This child can talk to me if he wants to. Where your mama at? Dead. My grandma's at work. Where's she work at? I don't know.

They ain't seen your mama in four days. Well, that's not like her. Where is she? They don't know, hell. And why I'm supposed to know? I don't know. I don't know her. Okay, my sister is dead. Their mama? She's dead. And so my mother is raising them, and that's who you should talk to to get your money. Okay, if she ain't there, you fixing to give me the $300 to get my window fixed and get my VCR, that's all I'm telling you. I'm telling you I don't have $300, and these ain't my kids. Lady, let me explain something to you. If you do not give me my money, I'm calling the popo on all three of these thugs. You can use my phone. Help us, Aunt April. We tried to find Grandma.

I want my $300. You gonna bring them over there to work for me? Do you understand this? You can't bring them to my house to do nothing. You know why? I got a white woman that lives next door to me, and I have a dog. You know what that means? I don't want Little O.J. and Michael Vick at my house. Well, I don't know what to tell you, lady, 'cause I don't have-- Fine. Fine. Make sure they be over at my house. Man, that thing ain't even worth three hun-- Say something else.

I am from Pastor Hector O'Malley's church in Colombia. You used to run missions there. That was a long time ago. What's your full name? Sandino. Sandino Ramirez. You seemed to be doing so well there. What are you doing here? Just come to this country to find a better life, to find some work. Not having much luck. I remember you're here. I wanted to see if you could help me. Got any special skills? What is it that you do? I'm a handyman. We have some things around here need to be fixed. We got plenty of tools, plenty of supplies. Don't have much pay, but we will pay you something. Stop! Come here! You, come here! Deacon! Deacon, deacon, stop that girl. Hold on, now. Come here! Let go of me. If I ever catch you in my store again-- [speaking foreign language] Miller, Miller! I got it. I'm gonna take care of it. You'd better, Pastor. [speaking foreign language] Young lady, you on drugs? No. Why? Where are your parents? I don't got no parents. Jennifer? Miss Wilma. You know this child? Yeah. That's Rose's granddaughter. She lives next door to me. Your grandmother's a member of this church. Well, have you seen her? Not in a while. [Pastor] You don't know where she is? No. You staying with April? No. Sister Wilma, take this man and show him where we're having the problem. Sandino, I'm gonna work on a place for you to stay, okay? Okay. Good seeing you again. Thank you, Pastor, good to see you, too. [knocking] [grunt] [knocking] [knock knock] Okay! This is bullsh-- Uh, Pastor. Hi, April. May we come in? [door closes] How are you, April? Sleepy. And you? All the better for seeing you. What did she do now? She was caught stealing from the drugstore. Oh. Maybe she was hungry. Then why was she stealing needles? Oh, I don't know. Her mother died from drugs, so maybe she's following in her footsteps. April. Ooh. This one right here. Come on. She's a kid. You know where my brothers at? Yeah, they out back. Why don't you go join them? Glad to. Good. Get out of here with all that attitude. I should've left you outside. April. That's okay, that's okay. 'Cause when they find my mama, they're going right back to her 'cause I haven't got time for these kids. Look, April. Your mother's getting older. Yeah. Yeah, she can't raise these kids by herself. Every time I see her, she's looking weaker and weaker. These are my sister's kids, not mine. Yeah, but your daddy left you and your sister this house. And? You haven't done much with it, though. Nope. I left it just how my daddy left it. It's falling apart, April. I guess so. There's a handyman at the church today. Just-- Just listen. And he needed a place to stay. So maybe, maybe, in exchange for his work, you can let him stay here. That's if he does a good job at the church. [sighs] That's a good idea, Pastor, but-- Now I guess it's time for me to go, huh? Yeah. I gotta work tonight. I'm sleepy. You still working at the club, April? Six nights a week. I'm praying for you, April. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. I'm gonna say my prayers for you before I go to sleep, okay? You do that. * Hallelujah [door closes] [knocking] You know what? [knocking] No way. Oh, God. [knocking] Y'all don't hear knocking at this damn door? This ain't our house. What? Hi. I'm Sandino Ramirez. What do you want, man? I went by the church today. I spoke to Pastor Brian. He told me to come see you. What do you want? I fixed a few things at the church today, and, well, the Pastor told me to come see if you need something-- anything fixed in your house. I can work for room and board. It's fine. Are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. Are you crazy? Oh, I'm loco. Come on. [door closes] Hello. Let me show you to the basement. You can sleep down here. I mean, I know it's not much, but it's warm. And there's a cot right there. And since I don't know you all that well, I'm gonna have to lock you down here in this basement. Wait a minute. What if there's a fire or something like that? You're a handyman, right? Break yourself out of here. Look, do you want it or not? Okay. And what about food? [sighs] Come on. You worried about food.

Let him have the ball. [Sandino] Okay. Go ahead, go ahead. Damn. You are fine. I knew it. You can't smoke around him. He's got asthma. You already said that. What's wrong with you, Manny? That kind of thing can happen when your mama's on crack when she's pregnant. Yeah, well, at the rate you're going, you're gonna end up just like her. You don't know anything about me. I know you're stealing needles. The needles was for him. He's got diabetes, too. What don't you have? Cancer. He's gonna need his insulin in the morning. Well, where is it? I dropped it. Brilliant.

I was just wondering have you talked to your mother lately? [sigh] Yeah, I went by the house earlier. She wasn't there. I don't know where she is. Well, you know, this is just-- It's not like her. No, it isn't. I don't know what to say. I was gonna come by there later on. Will you let me in? No, I can't do that, child. I let your sister in there one time. She stole everything your mama had. Yeah, well, you should've known better than to let a crack head in somebody's house. I can't let you go in there. Your mama had such high hopes for you. Miss Wilma, is there anything else you need? Because I really have to get ready for my next set. No, that's it. I'll see you later. Okay. Thank you. God bless you. All rightie. [door closes] You're doing a good job cleaning, Manny and Byron. Mabel, I done told you, I don't know why in the hell you're letting them children clean up anything up in here. You're gonna need metal detectors when they leave up out of here, I'm telling you right now. All right. How the dishes coming? Fine. [sigh] Little girl, you got the nastiest attitude I ever did see. Why are you so nasty? 'Cause. I was about to come over there and-- Joe, you better get this girl. She just said "'cause" to me. Uh, you better watch it, little girl. That's the heavyweight champion of the world you're talking to right there. She took out Ali and Frazier and George Foreman. They all-- They all came here, and she took them out. That's why George Foreman's selling grills now. With attitude like that, you're gonna be by yourself all your life. Ain't nobody gonna want to be around that. Maybe I don't want nobody around me. Yeah. Madea-- Madea want flies around her. Every time she goes somewhere, flies be flying around her. It's funky. [Manny] Don't do that, Byron. Mabel, that backwards boy's washing the soap. You get out of this life what you put into it. If you give good things to people, good things will come back to you most of the time. That ain't true. I said most of the time, child. Yeah, whatever. Girl, if you say "whatever" to me one more time, before the "wha--" can get out of your mouth, I'm gonna be in the back of a police car. Sit down. Sit down. You know what happens to little girls like you that's mad at the world? They grow up and become bitter old women if they don't figure out what's going on with them. Bitter old women, just like the one you're sitting there talking to. A bitter old woman. A bitter, 450-pound old woman. [snickering] Oh, that's funny? At least you can smile. Did that hurt? Did it crack your face, Cruella? I ain't got a whole lot to smile about. Hush that up. Got a whole lot to smile about. You're living. They got children your age in the hospital, strung out on HIV drugs and everything else. You sitting there talking about you ain't got nothing to smile-- You're a pretty little girl, honey. Get you a mirror and see how pretty you are. And smile at yourself sometime. I'm not pretty. I mean, I ain't got nice clothes or nothing. Clothes don't make you pretty. They make you broke. You know what I want you to do? 'Cause there ain't no mirror down here. When you get through cleaning that window, look at yourself and see how pretty you are. Go on, clean it real good. Then you'll see your smile-- ting. [Announcer] We want to give it up for the Gap Band. Give it up for the Gap Band, ladies and gentlemen. That's not the original Gap Band.

She look good tonight. Got her hair fixed. Oh, my Lord. The church. We got a lady here from the church. And I'm telling you, this lady can sing. She could really sing.

What are y'all waiting on? You know what she's gonna sing. Hold this, Freddy. Don't steal nothing. Miss Wilma. Let's do it. I'd like to dedicate this to all your beautiful faces, but especially... to April. * To fulfill the need to be * Who I am in this world * Is all I ask * I can't pretend to be * Something that I'm not * And I won't wear a mask * Ooh, you touched my face with love in your eyes * * But will you touch my heart * * With the understanding that it takes * * To realize * That I just can't play a part * * I got this need to be true * * To myself * And make my own mistakes * But I don't want to lean too hard * * On someone else * No matter what it takes * Uh-huh * I'm not fool enough * To ever think that I * Could be the master of my fate * * But it's up to me to choose my roads in life * * Oh, rocky may well be the ones I take * * Oh, the ones I take * There's a need to be something more * * Mm * Than just a reflection of a man * * I-- I can't survive * In someone's shadow * I need my very own little spot to stand * * Hey, hey, hey * If you're sure it's love * Real, real, real sure it's love * * For me Ha ha. * For little old me * Mm-hmm * 'Cause I am what I am * I am what I am * And I * Have the need * To * To be * Oh, oh Thank you. [Madea] Y'all go straight in the house, you understand? Boy, don't be slamming my door. [Sandino] Hey, wait. Thank you. Hey, how was it? I don't want to steal nothing else if that's what I gotta do to pay it back. That lady's crazy. [speaking Spanish] It means all of your decisions, your choices, they all have a price to pay. So you do the crime, you gotta do the time. Yeah, whatever. Look, we gotta take a bath. Go on upstairs. Jennifer? What's this? You bought his insulin. I was gonna do it. Now you don't have to. Why are you so nice to us? I don't understand that question. You're nice. Why? Why not? You should expect people to be nice to you. You shouldn't expect people to be mean. Not in this world. You get what you expect, right? I guess. You do a great job with your brothers. I'm all they got. [banging] Oh, come on. What the hell is Mexico doing? Are you serious? Hey! What-- Do you know what time it is? Yeah. It's 1:30 in the afternoon. What are you doing? I'm working off my debt. What? I figured that I get up this morning, get to work. I figured if I fix this floor, then the kids can stay in this room. Oh, you don't have to worry about those kids. They are not staying here, so pack up your little tools and go on back down the basement. Come on. Why not? Why they not staying here? What do you mean, wh-- [power tool motor grinds] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! [saw winds down] Stop it! You have a serious problem with this floor, okay? I know that. That's why no one ever comes up here, and that's why I keep the door closed. For safety, okay? These kids, they need a room of their own. Why are you so worried about kids that don't even belong to you? What's up with you? That's your family. Why you not concerned? Jennifer has nightmares every night. Manny, night sweats. Byron, he tosses and turns in his sleep. Can you imagine what those kids have been through? I just want to help them. [laughs] You want to help them? You live in my basement. You can't even help yourself. How you gonna help them? I'm gonna start by giving them this room. No. No, you're not. This is my house. Mi casa, ¿comprende? You can't give them nothing that doesn't belong to you. And if you're so worried about the kids, why are you making so much noise? You're waking them up. They were gone before I got up this morning. Ooh. Well, where did they go? Since you know so much about them. I don't know. But what do you care? You don't even make them feel comfortable to stay here. That's right. Three less things I gotta worry about. Now pack up your little tools and follow me back down the basement. Come on. You know, you don't-- Let's go. You don't even mean that. You don't know me. Let's go. Back to your dwelling spot. Hey. These kids, they need someone. They need some help. Okay, well, when my mama comes back, she will come and get them, and they will have someone. Happy? You're not this heartless, April. So why do you do this? Hmm? Is it because of your man? Is it because of him? You know, you're too good for him. Um, please, Sandino, stop it. Okay. I finish up after your man wakes up. Thank you. [knocking] Ugh. [knocking] [knocking] I'm coming! Shoot. [door opens] Pastor. Miss Wilma. What are you guys doing here? Hi, April. Hi. Can we come in? Hello. Hey. You clean up nice. Thank you. Getting any work done around here? Yes, as much as she'll let me. Great job in the chapel. We even have a check for you. That's great. I'll come by to pick it up. Um, hello. Is that what you came by for? Because I can go back to bed. [Pastor] April, can we sit down? Yeah, sure. What is it? It's a-- It's about your mother. You found her. God, where is she? I'm sorry, April. She died. What? What? [Wilma] I'm sorry, baby. When? About a week ago. What happened? She left for work. I saw her. And, uh... she had a brain aneurysm. A brain aneurysm? [Pastor] She was on the bus. All day. And, uh, no one noticed. She-- They assumed she was just asleep. And when the driver tried to wake her, it was too late. There was nothing anyone could do. I'm sorry, April. She was at the city morgue. No one claimed her. No identification. She was there too long, so... they cremated her. [gasp] Oh, my God. These are her remains. [Wilma] I-- I put them in this urn. I'm gonna go and pack up her things, and you're welcome to come by and get them. [Pastor] I'm sorry, April. [thunder rumbles] If you need anything, April, just-- just come by the church. [footsteps] You take care of her, hear? Yes, of course. [Pastor] April, we'll be praying for you. [door closes] What are you doing, man? Trying to sleep, girl. Do you want some company? That ain't no way for somebody to die. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. When was the last time that you spoke to her? A year ago. We-- We had an argument, and it's so stupid now. My sister... was so strung out. She screwed those kids up. She-- She traded Jennifer for crack one time when she was 9. She was so high one time, she put Byron in the oven. She burned Manny with her crack pipe. And my mother was there every time. Every time. She asked me to baby-sit, and I told her I couldn't. And I wasn't doing nothing. I just didn't feel like being bothered. So she got mad at me, and I never spoke to her again. I said some things I really wish I could take back. All the good she did for people, and she died on a bus. She was good to everybody. She died on a bus alone. [weeping] Watch out, y'all. Stay close together. [door opens, closes] Where have you been? Looking for Mama Rose. I have something to tell you. What is it? My mother died. What? Why are you lying? She's not lying. You will say anything just to get rid of us, huh? Jennifer. If you don't want us here, fine, we'll go. You don't have to say all that. It's not true. You will say anything. [Sandino] It is true, Manny. Can I go feed them? Yeah. [Sandino] Jennifer? Jennifer. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. People die. So what? Hey, listen. It's okay to cry or to be upset. I said I'm fine, okay? [Madea] Joe, turn that damn TV down, please. Hey, Inez, how you doing, honey? Hey! Good to see you. Fine, Madea. What you doing sitting out here? Trying to steal something? What's wrong with you? My grandmama died. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, baby. My Aunt April gonna send us back to foster care. They gonna separate us. I'm all Manny and Byron got. If we separate, I don't know-- I don't now what I'm gonna do. Calm yourself down, hon. Calm down, getting all worked up. Calm down. Can we stay with you? Huh? Nobody wants us. That ain't true. Somebody wants you. I'm only 16. I mean-- I don't know how to handle all this. Honey-- I'm tired. Living takes a lifetime. You got a whole lot more living to do, honey. I don't feel like I'm gonna-- I don't feel like I'm gonna make it. No, you're gonna make it. Hush that. Just gotta keep getting up every day, taking one day at a time. You'll make it. My Grandma Rose used to tell us to pray about it. Mm-hmm. Then that's what you ought to do. You ought to pray about it. Talk to the Lord about it. That's what you ought to do. Yeah, but she only told us-- She never told me how to do it. Would you teach me? Ar-uh? Please? Show you how to pray? Yeah. Whew. Lord, child, I ain't talked to God since the last time I saw a cop in my rearview mirror. Whew. I guess I can try. I can try to pray. You know the number? The num-- The what? The number. The number? To call him. They say Jesus on the main line, I don't know the num-- Sit back, sit back. Okay. Bow your head. First give an honor to God, to the head of my life. Um... * Father * I stretch * My hand * Yang-yang-yang-yang * To thee Father God, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God of Shadrach, Meshach, and the billy goat who was in the fiery furnace that they barbequed on the day of Pentecost, when the Jewish people returned from the Sabbath day up on the mountain top in Ethiopia. Uh, God of Mary... J. Blige. Madea, that don't sound right. Huh? That don't sound right. That's not how Mama Rose used to do it. You ain't feeling it? You don't feel the anointing? No. Honey, listen, I don't know nothing about praying, but all praying is is talking to God, having a conversation with him. And at the end of your conversation, you say "In the name of Jesus." That's your stamp that'll get it up there to him. You hear? Okay. You know who you remind me of right now? You remind me of Peter in the Bible. You know who Peter was? Uh-uh. Peter was one of the 12 disciplines. And they were on a boat out on the isle of the Greek Atlantic Ocean. And when they was on this boat, the storm rose up, and the 12 disciplines, they got really, really worried and upset. They said, "Oh, no, what we gonna do?" And they saw something coming to them on the water, looked like a ghost. But it wasn't a ghost. It was Jesus. And Peter said, "Jesus, if that's you, let me come out there." Whew. You gotta be careful what you ask the Lord for, so Jesus said, "Come on out." So Peter stepped out of the boat and was walking on the water. He was walking on water? On the water. He was walking on the water toward Jesus. Long as he kept his eyes on him, he stayed on top of the water. He took his eyes off him, though. You know why? He got distracted. You know why he got distracted? See, this is what you got to do. When you got your eye on Jesus, you can't get distracted by nothing. Jonah passed by in the belly of the whale, and he looked down here at that whale, Free Willy, with Jonah inside the belly, and it made him distracted, so he started to sink. He said, "Jesus, Jesus, help me, help me, Jesus." Jesus said, "I can't, I gotta go to Calvary, I'm late." So Jesus went on to the cross. He said, "But don't worry. I'm gonna send you a comforter. When the comforter comes, you're gonna be all right." So he's swimming, he try and swim, he try and swim. He's just worried, and Jaws was coming, all them-- Steve Spielberg had did that Jaws thing, and all it was around him, he was worried. You know what happened? What? Just in the nick of time-- See, this is what I'm talking about when you think you ain't gonna make it, just in the nick of time something'll happen. Noah came up in the arch. That's right. Noah came rowing up in the arch of-- St. Louis Arch, and he pulled right up beside him. And he got on there and he said, "Ooh, thank you for saving me." Peter-- Noah say, "No problem, man, cool, what's up, fool?" You know, so they spoke to each other. He said, "Come on, let me show you around," 'cause Noah had turned the arch into a cruise ship. 'Cause he didn't have nothing to do after he saved the world. And you know who was on there? Uh-uh. Eve. Eve? She was in the VIP section. Yep, that's right. And, uh, Peter asked and said, "Eve, come on, go to the show," so she went to see this show, and they had tigers. You know, they had two tigers, two bear, two lion-- You know how they did that, the male and the female. Well, Siegfried and Roy, they was there, and they had the two lions, and them lions jumped out and scratched Eve. That's how Eve get them two paws right there. You ever see Eve with the paws? She got two paws right there. Read your Bible sometime, honey. Read your Bible. [Woman] This is a mess, April. I mean, you don't care? I don't know. I mean, Tanya, it's-- You know, I can't help them kids. [hiccup] I mean, I didn't even ask for none of this. I ain't never seen a more selfish person in my life. Okay. What you-- What you mean by that, Tanya? I mean, April, you got to care about somebody other than yourself. You don't know me, babe, you don't-- Oh, I know you. No, you don't. That's the problem-- Tanya, look! I-- Look. I didn't come here for that, okay? Honey, I love you, so I can say this, okay? Girl, you're always drunk. Always. There's not a day that I have not seen you drunk. You just care about alcohol and "Where's Randy?" I mean, I'm sick of hearing that. You got a bigger problem on your hands right now, and if I wasn't your friend, if I didn't love you, I wouldn't bring it to you real, just like I'm giving it to you right now. April, you don't care about nobody but yourself. I mean, you're sleeping with a married man. You know why? Because you don't want him around all the time. You got that big old house, and you only want you in it. You won't even give a bum on the street 50 cent, April. I mean, you don't sound shallow. You just sound damn selfish. Oh, so I'm just a bad person, huh? I'm just evil, huh? You know what? Ain't nothing wrong with what you do. But as long as it works for you, that's all good, right? You need to get your life together fast. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Miss Tanya! [cheering, applause, stomping] [Man] Tanya! * Mm-mm-mm-mm Do it! * [vocalizing] * Oh, hey, hey, hey * [vocalizing] * Ah hah hah hah * Somebody told me once * That pain is a game we all got to play * * Then why am I in overtime * And sudden death every other day? * * I know that for the good of life * * There's a price we all got to pay * * But I'll pay till I'm poor * And I still don't know * What it is to have a good day * * Yeah * Since everybody knows * What it is that I need to do * * Well, do me a favor * Let me worry about me * And you worry about you * I don't need no one to put me down no more * * The ground can't get no lower * * And I don't need no one * To hang around and make me frown * * Just makes me look older * And I don't need no one * To black my eyes and tell me lies * * Don't want to cry over nobody else * * No, no, no, no * I can do bad all by myself * Somebody told me once * That running from that rain don't make no sense * * I had my own dark cloud for a while now * * It goes wherever I'm going, yeah * * They're telling me * The grass just might be greener * * On the other side * But I don't want to take a chance on dirt * * When I got grass * Even though the grass has died * * Oh, since everybody knows * What it is that I need to do * * Well, do me a favor * Let me worry about me * And you worry about you * I don't need no one to put me down no more * * The ground can't get no lower * * And I don't need no one * To hang around and make me frown * * Just makes me look older * And I don't need no one * To black my eyes and tell me lies * * Don't want to cry over nobody else * * No, no, no, no * I can do bad all by myself [humming] [humming] What's wrong with him? His blood sugar went up, so I gave him his insulin shot. Don't worry about it. I got it. He'll be fine. [sigh] I can't keep y'all. You don't owe us nothing. I think we can find you a great foster home. When I grow up, I'm going to be just like you. Ain't going to give a damn about nobody but myself. That's the only way to be. What the hell do I look like, sitting over here worried and looking after him, huh? I'm 16. When is my life gonna start, huh? I'm not ready for kids, Jennifer. I'm not-- I can't-- I can't do this. Just leave us alone. Just leave us alone. Just-- I don't need to be hearing about all this. * I can do bad * I can do bad * Don't waste time feelin' bad for me * * I didn't ask you for your sympathy * * No * I know God is watching over me * * So I guess this is where I'm supposed to be * * I don't need you to put me down no more * * The ground can't get no lower * * And I don't need no one * To hang around and make me frown * * Just makes me look older * And I don't need no one * To black my eyes and tell me lies * * Don't want to cry over nobody else * * Oh, no * Oh, I can do bad * And I don't need no one to put me down no more * * The ground can't get no lower * * And I don't need no one * To hang around and make me frown * * Just makes me look older * Y'all, and I don't need no one * * To black my eyes and tell me lies * * Don't want to cry over nobody * * Nobody, nobody else * And I don't need no one no more * * 'Cause I can do bad all by myself * * And I don't need no one * [cheering] Wow, you're up already, huh? It's early. Yeah. That's a good thing. Every day, you're sleeping your life away. Am I? [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, come with me. I got something for you. Where are we going? It's a surprise. Come on. I don't plan on getting my hair wet, so don't-- [laughing] You got a shower cap? [attendant] No. Sorry. You didn't tell me I was going to be working out. Have fun. Why you sleep all day? Huh? Why not? Why not? I don't know. That's not an answer. [chuckles] Well, since you're asking all the questions, why did you hold me the way you did when I told you my mother died? Because you needed to be held. Yeah, but it was the way you held me. I mean, you held me like-- like you cared. You don't know that I care by now? Why? You know, if you have to ask that question, you just don't know yourself, I guess. That's still not an answer. April, I think that you are a very warm and sensitive, loving person, and you are funny. You are very funny. I'm not that funny. Cut it out. But you hide it. You hide it all away. I don't understand. You put up this wall so that nobody sees it, but I see through it. I don't understand you and-- and him. Hmm. Talking about Randy again? Yes. He's not so bad. He's not so good, either. Doesn't make sense to me. Do you love him? He helps me out. He pays the bills. That's not what I asked you. April. Do you love him? In a way, I guess. I don't know. That is no love, April. Knowing married men, sharing him with his wife. Love's not having somebody to pay your bills. It's not having to work all night, and it's not love. Love is... Love is being too tired from the night before to even go to work the next day. Whatever. April, we're all looking for love in one way or another. Love is having someone there in the morning when you wake up and is gonna be there with you, thick or thin, right or wrong. Let's go. [laughing] Oh, my God, I can't believe you talked me into getting on a boat. You better be glad I didn't get my hair wet. You know black girls don't like getting their hair wet. Thirsty? Yes, I would like something to drink, please. Hi. Hi, kids. How was school? Fine. Good. You okay? Yeah. He's all right. Okay, good. I have a surprise for everybody, okay? Come on, April. I want you to see. You're going to love it. Come on. This is something. Your surprises. I want your eyes closed, okay? This is a big surprise. Come on. Come on, Manny, Byron. Come here. Come here. Stand right here. Jennifer, come on. There. Ready? You ready? Yeah. Open your eyes. [Manny] Whoa. Is this our room? This is your room. Thanks. No, it's not. But it looks like it's for us. It is. It's not. Where you steal all this stuff from? I didn't steal any of this stuff. The church gave it to me. It was in the basement. [Jennifer] Right. My bed. My bed. Yes, Byron, that's your bed. Uhh... I never heard him speak before. [Byron] My bed. My bed. This is the bomb, Sandino. Why do you got to get their hopes up for? You know she don't want us here. Hey, that could change. Could is not definite. She definitely don't want us here. Listen, how about you stay in this room for as long as you're here, okay? I made it for you. Thank you, but we, uh, we stay downstairs. Come on, y'all. Manny, Byron, I said come on. Do we have to go? Yes, we have to go. Why didn't you tell me you were doing this, huh? Now they're upset. What difference does it make, April? You made it very clear to them that you don't care. April, come on. We're going. What the hell you knocking on this door for, Mexico? I'm trying to wake up April. For what? Because we're supposed to be going to church. Well, April ain't going to no church. You listen real good, houseboy. Your ass knock on this door again, I'm sending you back to Mexico in a pine box. Ain't a damn thing for you in here. [Pastor] This morning, our subject comes from the text found in Luke 15:8. It reads "Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, "if she lose one, "doth not light a candle and sweep the house "and seek diligently until she find it? "And when she hath found it, "she calleth her friends "and says 'Come rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost'." Where the hell you going? To church. Church? No, you ain't. [sigh] Uh, Randy, I'm going to church. We can talk about this later. Uh, hold-- April. Come here now. I said you ain't going, all right? Who's going to stop me? What is all this? I never seen you dressed for no church. How I look? April. April, I'm talking to you. Today our subject is value added. [congregation murmurs] There are three things I want to talk about from this subject. Number 1, this woman was a good steward. All right. Because she took time to know what she had and how much of what she had. [Woman] Yeah. Therefore, because she watched it every day, she knew when a piece of silver was lost. [Woman] Yeah. Secondly, she gave value to each piece of silver. [Woman] Right. She did not extol one piece over the other. And thirdly, when she discovered that one was lost-- [Woman] Uh-huh. ...she swept the house clean to find it. Amen. [clapping] Uh, you don't know what it is to walk the floor worrying over something you've lost. Aunt April's here. All of us love, and somehow our love is limited when someone ends up somewhere that we don't want them to be. [Woman] All right. But what she knew is that even though this piece of silver was lost, it had not lost its value. Amen. It had just lost its usefulness. You cannot help anyone when you're lost. You cannot fulfill your mission in life when you're lost. You cannot help your family or your fellow man when you're lost. [chattering] And somebody has to care enough about you-- Yes! ...to put a light in a very dark place. When you're caught in the crevices of life and can't figure out how to get out, you need somebody that's going to care enough about you-- All right. ...that says you're worth it! I want you to know that you're worth me waiting on. Oh, Lord have mercy. I said you're worth me waiting. ** [organ] There are some things that we face. You've come to people-- [Woman] Yes. ...and it seems as if they don't want to know. I understand it. I've been there. As a matter of fact, let me say it like this. Tell it, preacher. * I've hurt so many nights * Uh-oh-oh * I cried so many hours * Trying to make it right * Yeah, trying to make it right * * But just didn't have the power * * And you ignored all my tears * * It hurt me so bad [Woman] Sing your song. * You wanted them to disappear * * I tried to let it go * But I guess * You just don't want to know * Listen to me. * If I had a dime for every time * * I tried to call your name * Something tells me * Something tells me * I'd be wealthy * I'd be wealthy * [vocalizing] * Oh, Lord [sigh] * But I learned that I could cope * * Yes, I did * Through my trouble I discovered * * I discovered I could make it * * Whoa-oh * And nights so long and cold * * [vocalizing] * So cold * Ooh-wah * You don't know how cold * * I discovered I * I discovered I could take it * * Ohh * Now I wouldn't * I wouldn't change a thing Whoa, Lord have mercy. * Not for the knowledge * Not for the knowledge that I've gained * Do you know what I discovered in my trials? * I learned that I could grow * * I really did * I tried, I tried to let * Let it go * I did * I tried * Tried to let it show * But I guess * You just don't want to know * * Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey * Don't want to know * Yeah, yes * Really don't want to know * You don't want to know * How many nights I cried, yeah * * You don't know how many times * * I felt like I was going without, but * * But I kept on moving * I kept on hopin' * I kept on believin' * And now I can tell you * That I'm over * That I'm over Anybody here can see I'm over. I'm over it now. * I can't explain it * But right now I'm-- I-- * I'm over it, yeah * I'm over it right now * One morning I just broke free * * And the chains, they just dropped off of me * * People can talk about me as much as they please * * But I'm all grown up now * I said I'm all grown up now * * And I've got the victory * 'Cause I'm over * I'm over it now * I'm over it now * Over it now * I'm over it now Say it again! Say I'm-- * Over it now Just wave your hand if you know you're over it. If you're feeling the presence of God, if you feel the anointment of God, just declare it now that I'm over it now. Say it right now. * Over it now [Pastor] I didn't think I could be free. * But I'm over it * Now [Woman] Amen. * I'm really over it now * Went to a meeting one night * * And my heart wasn't right * But something got a hold of me * * And I'm over it now [choir] * Just don't want to know Wilma. Wilma, would you just-- People don't know you been through some things. Sure. They think because you're looking so pretty in your hat, they don't know what you been through, but could you just say one good time "I'm over it now"? * I'm-- * I'm over it now * Over it now * I can't say how * But I'm over it now [Woman] Wilma! * Right now, right now * Right now, right now, right now * * I'm over it now * Over it now * I'm over it now * I don't have to live with it * * I don't have to live with it * * I don't have to be in it * * Don't have to be in it * * 'Cause I'm over it now * Over it * Over it now * Over it now * I can't say how * But I'm over it * Now * Now * Right now * Now, now, now * Right now * Now, now, now * Now, now, now, ooh * I'm over it now * I tried to let it go I really did! * I tried to let-- let it show * Thank you, Jesus. * But right now * I learned that I could grow * * But I guess * You just don't want to know * [Man] Hallelujah! [Pastor] You're worth it. Give him praise because he's worthy. His purpose is real. You're gonna make it. You'll be all right. You don't have to worry any longer. You're over it now. You're over it. Thank you. Wow. [whimpering] Hey, Manny. [whimpering] I'll be right back. How you doing, beautiful? I seen the way you been looking at me. See, this here's my house, and I can let you and them two little nappy boys stay here. Right. Baby girl, I'll get you all the medicine you need. I need to give him his insulin. See, what you need to do is take care of me. If you don't stop right now, I'm going to tell April. [keys jingling] What makes you think she's gonna believe you? Huh? Think she's gonna believe you? I'm gonna take it from you. [whimpering] [muttering] What are you doing? Get off of him! Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing to him? [groaning] What is going on here? [sobbing] It's okay. It's all right. Come on. He tried to rape her. They're lying on me. They're lying on me. [Jennifer crying] This little slut-- You know she's a slut-- She tried to get me to have sex with her for money. Sandino, you saw it! Tell her what you saw. He tried to rape her! Who do you believe, huh? Who do you believe? Huh? Who do you believe? [Jennifer] He's lying! He's lying, April. He's lying. [Jennifer continues crying] Who you gonna believe, them or me, baby? [Jennifer sobbing louder] You, baby. He's lying! Go upstairs and get in the tub. I can't believe you! You believe him! [Sandino] It's okay. Okay. He's lying! He's lying, April. [Jennifer sobbing] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It's okay. [sobbing] Nobody's going to hurt you. [loud sobbing] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're going to be okay. All right? It's okay. [sobbing] No one's going to hurt you. Nobody is going to hurt you. [sobbing] Nobody's going to hurt you. No, please. It's okay, Jen. Oh, baby, I think I broke my nose. Oh, baby, thank you. You know I love you, right? Mm-hmm. Baby, I'm just trying to provide the best life for you that I can. What happened? Baby, I told you what happened. That little girl tried to get me to have sex with her for money. Baby, your kids ain't no good. They're spending up all my damn money, baby. You know? I mean, everything was fine before they got here. [footsteps] It's all their fault, baby. Them kids causing all kind of problems. Paying all these bills around here. These damn raggedy-assed kids come here snatching up all our money. I didn't need them damn kids. I told you that. [static] We all got problems since they got here. [female singer] * ...moments last forever Tell me what happened. ** [soul] April, I told you what happened. Tell me what you did. April, I didn't do nothing. ** [continues] That's my niece. [electricity crackling] She's 16. A-April, calm down now. What did you do? I told you I didn't do nothing, April. You are just like Lee. April, stop! He told my mother he didn't do nothing, either. Stop! Stop it, April! Damn! April! Get that radio away from the water! April, stop! You wait here, okay? [Randy shouting] Watch your sister. Stop! Are you playing? I told you! April! [sobbing] April! Damn it-- Just like Lee. He told my mother he didn't do nothing. April. That it was my fault! That I did it! April, that damn thing is plugging up city water! Shut up! He's not worth it. Put the radio down, please. Stop! Let go! You want me to put it down? Hey! You want me to put it down? April, don't-- April, no! [Randy grunting] You got three minutes to get your stuff and you get the hell out of here. Hey. Why did you leave them alone? April, he's gone, okay? He took his keys. He won't be back. You okay? Hmm. I should have known. April, this is not your fault. I should have known. The way he looked at her. I should have known. Like my mother should have known. She would always say "Whatever happens in this house stays in this house." [scoff] Nothing ever gets healed if you keep it covered up. I should have known. I need a man. A grown man. Takes interest in the little kids. Someday, right? Come on, April, that's enough. Get off of me. Are you one, too? What? A child molester. Are you a child molester, Sandino? Are you asking me this question? Why do you care so much about those kids? I hit a nerve. Enough. What you like, huh? Do you like the little girls, or do you like the little boys? I said that's enough. You shut your mouth. You are you talking to? Come back here. Come back here. Hey! Hey. Tell me. Stop it. What is it? Tell me! Enough, April! You get your stuff out of my house, you child molester! I'm not a child molester! You stop calling me that! Why are you so uncomfortable? You want to make me a bad person for showing these kids some love? These kids that have nobody? You're sick! You're out of your mind, you know that? You don't know my life, April! I have nobody. From the time that I was 7 years old and picking coca leaves 10, 12 hours a day and getting beaten when I'm hungry or tired. And then, when I'm old enough, the cartel, they send me out to recruit children to do the same thing! I see these kids, I want to help them, and you want to get in the way of that! I feel sorry for you. What the hell are you looking at? Move out of the damn way! [door slams] Hmm. [keys clatter] You don't ever have to worry about him coming back. He's never coming back. Get some sleep. Wait. Uh, uh, April. Thank-- Thank you for believing me. Baby, I believed you when you said it. I know that look. Wait. Wait. If you let us stay here, I promise we won't be no trouble. I-- I'll cook and clean for you, and the boys, I'll take care of them. You won't have to do nothing. Jennifer-- Wait. Let me finish. I'll quit school. I'll get a job-- Jennifer, you don't have to quit school. And I'll help you pay the bills. And I-- I can be a good girl. I-- I won't be so angry. I'm just so tired-- I-- ...of going from place to place. I-- I need y'all to stay with me. I just messed-- I messed everything up. And, uh, I got to fix this, so, uh, you got to stay here with me, okay? And, uh, I really-- I would love it if you taught me how to take care of your brothers. Jennifer. We will get through this okay. You're a good girl. We will be all right, okay? Now get your brothers and come up to your new room. Hey, come on, go get your brothers. Byron, you got to wake up. [knocking] [Jennifer] Come in. She's going to let us stay. I know. Ain't that supposed to be good? Yeah, Manny, it's plenty good. Why do you look sad? I'm not sad. I have to go away for a while. What? Where are you going? Gonna shoot straight with you guys, okay? Things aren't going very well with me and your aunt, so it's best that I leave. In the meantime, I'm going to call you and write letters, okay? And you make sure you write me back. [Manny] All right. [Jennifer] Hmm. I understand. I mean, you got to do what you got to do, right? We're gonna miss you. I'm going to miss you, too. Come here. All right. I'm going to miss you, Sandino. I'm going to miss you, too. Hey. Hey. Um... he's gone. Yeah, I know. Um, you want to help me unpack some of Mama Rose's things? Sure. That's cute. You know, I think you're wrong about him. What do you know about this? That's a good man, and I don't think you should just let him go like that. You're too young to understand, baby. Yeah, but... I know there's a lot of bad people in this world. Yeah. You find somebody that you can trust, then you should probably hold on to them. I mean, it's like when Peter was walking on the water and he got distracted by the whale and he started to drown, Noah came in the St. Louis arch and-- Wait, wait. What? What? He was drowning, and Noah-- He was-- Wait a minute. Who told you this story? Well, Madea was telling me these Bible stories-- Oh, Lord, her. Girl, even I know that ain't right. I know that story. Come on. Guess I should have known better, huh? Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to take you to church more often, huh? [choir] * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me * Please help me on my jour-- * * On my journey * Oh, Lord * Help me on my way * Sing it, oh * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me What is it? Shh! [sigh] It's weird. They're singing Mama Rose's favorite song. She still knows when to show up. * Tell an angel * Help me on my way * Say oh * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * [Woman] Yes! Whoo! * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me * I said oh, Lord * I want you to help me * Help me on my journey * Oh, help me on my way, yeah * * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me * While I'm waiting * I want you to help me * Saying while I'm waiting * I want you to help me * Tell them to help me * Help me on my journey * Oh, help me on my way * On my way * Sing Lord * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me * Oh, help me on my journey, Lord * * Help me on my way, yeah * Oh, Lord * I want you to help me [Pastor] * Singing while I'm singin' * * I want you to help me * Oh, while I'm singin' * I want you to help me * Lord, help me on my journey * * Help me on my way * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * * Say, oh, Lord * I want you to help me * Choir, help me say oh * Oh * Oh, Lord * I want you to * Help me Anybody need help today? * Help me on my journey Come on down now for prayers if you want the Lord. * Help me on my way * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * * Help me on my journey * Help me on my way * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * * Help me on my journey * Help me on my way * Oh, Lord, I want you to help me * * Help me * Help me Hi. Hi. I'm-- I'm so sorry. I'm not really good at knowing how to love anything or...anybody. But I really like having you around. And since you talked me into keeping the kids, I really-- I would love for you to just stay here with me and help me with the kids. Please. Say something. What do you want me to say? What do you want to say? I don't know. What is this, your way of telling me that you like me or something? I do. I can admit that. I think I love you. Please say something. I don't know what to say. I mean, you're a good human being. I love you like a friend, like-- like I love Tanya. [scoff] Okay. Like you love Tanya. You don't believe me. No. I don't believe you. Okay? You don't believe I love you. April, let's not get into this, okay? No, tell me, please. Okay. You don't fully love yourself, okay? Everybody that loves you in your life, you push them away. You keep them at a distance. What are you, a psychiatrist? Not a psychiatrist, but I know love. Look at you. That's not love. You're drinking, smoking yourself to death. Your father dies of liver cancer. You don't love yourself the way I love you. What? I said that I love you. What, like a-- like a friend, like a buddy, like a pal? No, April, I don't want to make love to my buddies or my pals. I'm in love with you. I'm ready to love you, but you have to be ready to give it back the right way. I want to learn how to love the right way. Will you show me? I'll show you. [crowd cheering] [no audible dialogue] That's right. You can't hold my girl down. 'Cause she a good woman, y'all. Uh-huh. Y'all ready? * Uh * Been many days, couldn't take the pain * * Thought I should take my life away * * See it every day * In every other young sister's faces * * See 'em frown, y'all * Mind full of doubt * Runnin' in the street * Low self-esteem * Thinkin' that used to be me * * What a shame * Damn, life is a mother * It's hard to sit back * And see the same thing that happened to me * * Happen to you * This ain't enough * So here's the love I want to give you * * Don't let it get to you * Don't be afraid * You can kick it, you can break through * * Take what I've been through * * To see that you can't hold a good woman down * * Been through the same point of givin' up * * But, like, I had enough * Went to the edge of the ledge * * But I didn't jump * My life will sum it up * You can't hold a good woman down * * No * When I used to see * My daddy beat my mother down * * Down to her feet * I used to say * That ain't gonna never be me, no * * Now look at you, broke up from him * * Girl, recognize you're better than * * Him telling you * That he'll never hit you again * * Girl, don't cry * I can see the same thing that happened to me * * [vocalizing] * Happen to you * This ain't enough * So here's the love I want to give you * * Don't let it get to you * Don't be afraid * You can kick it, you can break through * * Take what I've been through * * To see that you can't hold a good woman down * * Been through the same point of givin' up * * But, like, I had enough * Went to the edge of the ledge * * But I didn't jump * My life will sum it up * You can't hold a good woman down * * Through the changes I will hold your hand * * Use my songs as remedy * Whenever you're feeling down and blue * * I'll be there for you * Just know that I'm aware * Yeah, I've seen the things that you can't see * * Looking at you resembles me * * But you got to hold on * Whoa, girl, don't cry * [vocalizing] * You can do it * Take what I've been through * * To see that you can't hold a good woman down * * You can't hold a good woman down * * Went to the edge of the ledge * * But I didn't jump * Went to the edge of the ledge * * But I didn't jump * [vocalizing] * You can't hold me, you can't hold me down * * You can't hold me, you can't hold me down * * You can't hold me * You can't hold no good woman down * * Whoa-oh-oh * You can't hold me down * Hold me down, no, no * No * Don't let it get to you * Don't be afraid * You can kick it, you can break through * * Take what I've been through * * To see you can't * No * Hold a good woman down * Been through the same point of givin' up * * But, like, I had enough * Went to the edge of the ledge * * But I didn't jump * My life will sum it up * You can't hold a good woman down * [cheering] There you have it. I'm still with you, my sisters! My troubled sisters! I still got problems, too. You're not alone! [Joe, whispering] He's-- He's slow. Elevator don't go all the way up there. The lights is on at the mall? Oh, no, no. The mall is open, but ain't nobody shopping. [Madea] You ain't going to eat those? You got to learn how to talk in the real world. When people ask if he's slow, you say, "You ride the big bus or the little bus." You don't know what I'm talking about. No. Okay, fine. Hell. I believe you're on the little bus, too. Come here, boy. You're funny. You're the next-- uh, who that? Tyler Perry. You're the next Tyler Perry, man. I'm telling, you're funny. Ha ha ha! I love that "Modea." He's slow. The mall open, but ain't nobody shopping. [Manny] Who are you talking about? The elevator don't go all the way up to the top floor. The car is running, but ain't no engine. Are you okay? I'm-- No, hell, I'm fine. Is he okay? I'm just trying to-- Boy, maybe you is a little slow, too. Maybe-- Maybe your book ain't got no pages in the middle. Your grandma went to work for four days and never come back? Yeah. I know what she do for a living. What? Well, I'll tell you when you get a little older. [chuckling] There's a reason women disappear for four days and come back. [chuckling] [laughing] The looks you're giving me are priceless. Okay, keep going. Shut your mouth. She left and never came back? Yeah. I wouldn't have come back, either, trying to feed him. I hate you. Wow. [Jennifer] Manny, eat your food and shut up. Yeah, you better eat it because I'm getting ready to choke you out. [Man] Joe, they can talk to me. Where's your mama? [whispering] Say something else. I dare you. Say something. [whispering] Uncle. [Jennifer] Leave him alone. Eat. What you laughing at, Freddy? [whispering] They're lying. I can still hear you. Mabel, I'm going to beat him down. Will you shut up? Who the hell you talking to? Get your hands off me! [Jennifer] You back up off him! Stop laughing. Turn around here. The camera's rolling. [laughing] Get out of the way, crack head. [laughing] We're tired. We're done. Let's roll out of here. Let's go. [laughing] Maybe she was hungry. [Pastor] Hungry, April? Is that a reason to steal? No. Even more, she was caught stealing needles. [growl] Wow. Did you hear my stomach? [laughter] Yeah, you don't feed me around here! I'm hungry! [Man] Here we go. One more time. You touch us again, I'm going to call 911 this time. You call 911, honey? They don't scare me. I call 911. I will call them for you. I will ask them to come over here. I will ask them to send the police or Child Welfare. I will ask them to straight up send an ambulance. [cough] Cough again. Cough one more time. Hell, I'm trying to learn these lines I don't know. She's over there coughing off camera. And I'm trying to do a scene. What the hell I'm supposed to do? Come here. [laughing] Come here. Bring me the book. I need to see where the hell I am. [laughing] Come here! Shh! Now give me the lines. [kids laughing] "But when I shove it down your throat." Would that be a good one? [laughter] Say it like I say it. [imitating Madea] But when I shove it down your throat. Okay. Now sit down. [laughter] When I shove it down your throat! There's a letter in here for you, from Mama Rose. To me? Well, what do you know? You read it? Me? Yeah. "Dear April, "If you're reading this, "I'm probably past my suffering. "April, my dearest child, "you are beautiful, bright, and brilliant. "If you're ever nominated for an Academy Award, be humble about it." [laughter] "Remember the people "that helped you along the way, props, hair, make-up, wardrobe--" [giggling] "grips, electricians, "camera, sound... scripty, and most of all Mr. Tyler Perry." I knew that one was coming. I knew that was coming. "And, April, "if you're ever walking from your trailer and you see an airplane--" [both] Duck. Yes! "Love, Mama Rose." [laughing] You know what? Everybody can get out of here. Good night. Closed-Captioned By Burbank, CAServices, Inc.
