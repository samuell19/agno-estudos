Well,thisisatruestory. yo!Headsup! Here you go. Thanks. - Gale sayers? - Yeah. Hey. Brian piccolo. We met up in buffalo In that all-American game last june. Sorry. I didn't remember. I'm not very good at that kind of stuff. Oh, golly. Hey, that's all right. I can see how you might forget, but, well, i sure couldn't. Thatwasaheckofatalk wehad, man. I said, uh, "i'm brian piccolo. I hear we'll both be playing for the bears." And you said... Well, i'll never forget it. You said, "uh-Huh." Just like that. "Uh-Huh." Whenever i'm feelin' kind of low and depressed, well, I think about that advice. A lot of guys wouldn't have talked to me at all, But not you. You just said, "uh-Huh." Just like that. Right out. Uh-Huh. Where do i go to check in? Oh, uh, that building over there. That's where halas is. Uh-Huh. Hey. Did you ever meet him before? Talked to him on the phone a couple of times. That's all. Yeah. Well... Look, let me give you a little hint, all right? See, he's, uh... I mean, he's a good guy and all that, But he's a little deaf in his left ear. And a little too vain to admit it. You understand? So you gotta stand on his right-Hand side If you want him to hear a word you say. Uh-Huh. Okay. Thanks. You bet. Hey, rookies got to stick together. Pardon me. Can you tell me the way to halas's office? Thank you. Come in. Well, sayers. I'm george halas. Yeah, i know. Everybody knows who you are. You're just in time to give me a hand with this thing. My good luck picture. That's the first professional team i ever played on. Decatur staleys in 1920. How's your leg? I understand we... I understand where you hurt it. It's fine. One hundred percent. And your head? My head? Uh, nothin' wrong with my head. Good. 'Cause being in that all-Star game put you three weeks behind everybody else. Ain't gonna be easy. Nfl ain't supposed to be easy. That's right. All i can promise you is a fair shot. But you're gonna have a lot of company. John arnett, ralph kurek, brian piccolo. Gonna be plenty... Gonna be plenty crowded out there. Well, a fair shot is all i want. Can't ask more than that. Well, we plan in using our backs as receivers this year. Did you do much... Did you do much pass catching when... When you were in college? Uh, well, yes, sir. I did. Uh, usually, uh, safety valve stuff. Yeah. Well, i like to keep my backs in a pattern. That is, unless the other team's blitzin'. And that's something you're gonna have to watch. Those linebackers. You gotta make sure they're not coming in. I know. Especially with... What the hell are you doing? I... I don't know what you mean. Well, i know you got moves, But you don't have to show 'em to me now. You're bouncin' around here like a... Like a pauper in a pay toilet. Well, i was just tryin' to get on the side Of your, uh, good ear. Good ear? What are you talking about, "good ear"? Uh... Uh, brian piccolo, uh, Said that, uh... He, uh, said, uh... Uh... Hey, sayers. We're gonna have to stop meetin' like this. My wife's startin' to get suspicious. Hold it down. Hey. Some of you cats that pulled in today... Haven't had a chance to hear what's gonna be expected of you. So hold it down and let me talk. Now, you new guys are gonna get a playbook tomorrow. It'slikethebible. Now, you lose your playbook, it's gonna cost you $1,000. Listen, i heard this thing twice already today. One,zero,zero,zero. Lose your playbook, it costs you $1,000. Lose it a second time, they cut off your right foot And feed it to the defensive platoon. Would you cool it, please? Hey, i am just trying to be helpful. Like you helped me with halas? Well... Mr. Sayers! I was just mentioning the fine for talking at team meetings. Did you hear what i said? No, i did not. Well, the fine for talkin' at team meeting is $25. And it's just been laid on you. Canyoudigthat? Yeah. Sorry, man. hey, hold up. Whoa. It's been brought to my attention that unless sayers was saying his beads, It might be fair if mr. Piccolo would sing us a song. Saylikemaybe afightsong. Wake forest, right, mr. Piccolo? Yeah. That's right. You can't let it get to you. It's just a question of style.

And, uh, it's not one of my strong points. Understand? Try going to your left. They don't look for a right-Handed guy to throw going to his left. Okay. I will. Thank you. Hey, sayers. I did say thank you. I know. Well, that usually calls for a response. Like, uh, "You're welcome," or "how's your mother?" Something. "How's your mother?" Well, she's very fine.

He didn't at the time! Hello, gale. Sitdown. You know ed mccaskey, j.C. I'll call you back on it, all right? Want some iced tea? Yeah. Please. There you go. I'll tell you what we want to talk to you about, gale. See, i'm, uh... Well, i'm an old-Timer in a lot of ways. At least that's what some people keep tellin' me. But i don't think it's all that common for a man of my age to... Well, to be used to the way things are. To be comfortable with things. What it comes down to is that j.C. Had a notion here, And ed seems to think it's a good idea. And i guess maybe we are due for some changes around here. You want me to play flanker, not running back. no!No. No, it's not that simple, gale. It's j.C.'S idea, and yes, i did agree with him. Thisis1965, And we'd like the bears to room together... According to position, without any regard to race. So we'd like you and brian piccolo to room together. That's all? That's what this is about? - Is that all? - Yeah. You had me worried. I thought it was something really... This is something, really. A white man and a black man roomin' together on a team... That's never been done before. You're gonna be called a tom by some blacks And uppity nigger by some whites. When we go on the road, man, i'm talkin' about atlanta, houston, Miami, new orleans. It ain't gonna be no better in detroit or minnesota or san francisco... Or any other town we play in. You gonna rock the boat, sayers, And there's people out there that's already seasick. What j.C. Is saying is that there may be some pressures. Severe ones. Now, what do you say? Hi. Gonna be roomin' together. Says who? Who else? that'sterrific. Sort of a shame he couldn't ask me how i felt about it, isn't it? Look, you want me out? Nah, i don't want you out. Stay. I guess i'm just... Steamed at the old man for not puttin' me in that scrimmage this afternoon. That your, uh... That your wife? Yeah. Pretty. So's yours, and the little girl. Thanks. Supposed to call her tonight, tell her how i'm going. I guess that might be the shortest phone call in history. Maybe not. Pick. They wouldn't assign us to room together... Unless we both made the team. That's right, isn't it? Uh-Huh. Come on. Let's go call our wives. I just called... That was just practice. This is for real. Come on! Congratulations on making the team, gentlemen. Well done. You know coach halas kind of frowns on hazing... Ofnewmen. Butnowthatyou madetheteam, It's like you're one of us! Welcome to the chicago bears! passfrombutkustosayers completeforatouchdown... Forthebears. Beautiful game. Is playing in the nfl any easier than you thought it would be? My first game. I'm not exactly an expert. J.C. Caroline says he hasn't seen anybody carry the ball for the bears like that... Since willie galimore. The blocks were there. That's not what you said last night. You called the offensive line the, uh, seven blocks of silly putty, i think it was. - Pick. - You're brian piccolo. Sure, uh, that's right. Piccolo. P-I-C-C-O-L-O. You two are the only black and white player rooming together on the team. Uh, any problems so far? Not as long as he doesn't use the bathroom. pick. hey,uh,gale,whenyourun, Doyouthink aboutwhatyou'redoing, ordoyoujustdoit? ijustdoit. Well,startthinkin'aboutit, willya? Iwannaplaysometoo. better save it. Anyway... Concannon calls this trap play, see? You know what a trap play is? Um, uh, yeah. I think so. A trap play is when all the linemen go one way, And hopefully the defense goes the same way, and if they do, See, there's a big hole, and if they don't, well, it's bad news. Anyway, concannoncalls thistrapplay, And, uh, it's beautiful... 43 yards... Wasn't it 43? And halas sees he's tired... And sends me in, so i go in. He comes out. Concannon figures he's gonna get really foxy, you know. Concannon is... He says, "same play." Verysameplay. Trap play is also called a "sucker" play, Because it makes the defense look real bad when it works. And defenses do not like to look real bad, see. Makes 'em kind of surly. Anywaygo this way,nemen And it's like i am looking at a team portrait... Of the los angeles rams. Hey, deacon, merlin. How's the family, rosey? I was afraid to get up. I figured not everything was gonna come with me. You've never seen anyone so black and blue in your life. It's like i'm roomin' with a colored player again. Gale told a joke! The stone face from kansas speaks. All right. Hey, chicago! Chicago! Sayers speaks! He speaks. hey,blackmagic, Listentothisletterigot. "You must have been raised with pigs To stay in the same room with one of those darkies. "You mustnothavebeentaught anythingwhenyouwereaboy. Youmusthavecrawledout fromundersomeslimyrock." isthatall?

The man we're honoring tonight was a two-Time all-American at the university of kansas. He was the top draft choice of the chicago bears of 1965, And three times during the course of the season, he gained 100 or more yards. Perhaps his best individual performance came last december... All right. Go ahead. From the top. All right. I wanna thank you all for this honor, But i really think it's not right to give it to one man. Uh... Football is a team sport. And, uh... here he is, rookie of the year. Start from the top. Look up. Gale sayers! Uh... I'd like to thank you all for this honor. Though it's not really right... Thank you. Who'd believe it? I mean, who would ever believe it? Dumb. All right. Let's go. On the line. Davis. Turner. Ready, set, go. Seely, riles. Ready, set, go. O'bradovich, caroline. Hey, since when does the defensive lineman have to race the defensive halfback? You're not racing against me. You're racing the clock. I ought to have a handicap. Well, you said the defensive backfield Was your handicap all last year, o.B. Aw, shut up. You're still a rookie to me. Cut it out. Pick, get back in line. Ready, set... You just get in? Yeah. I would've been earlier, But my plane got fogged in, in detroit. Ready,set. You look like you're in pretty good shape. I been workin' hard all winter. Did you get a chance to talk to linda today? No. Why? Thought you might've heard. Joy's expecting again. Hey, that's great. We think so. If it's a boy, we'd like to name it after you. Ready? No kidding. It's got a real nice ring to it. Go!

Would you like a sandwich or something? No, i'm not hungry. You go ahead though. Well, i left the kids at joy's, so i guess i'd better go pick them up. Will you be all right? Yeah. - You sure? - Yes!

Thatisnotsupposedtobe anythingotherthanwhatitis, Which is a leg-Lift machine. What for? Whatfor? Well, getting that knee back in shape... Is not gonna be a take-It-Easy proposition. Well, if you're afraid, i mean, that's understandable. I'm not afraid. You ought to be afraid, gale. I am not afraid. I'm just tired of bein' bugged by reporters, linda, you! Hey, you know, you are a real charmer, sayers. An absolute saint. Look, maybe you think it's a real friendly thing... Hey. You can stick that in your ditty bag too, You dumb jackass. You know, gale, when, uh... When i was in high school, I was one of the best backs in the state. Unfortunately for me the best back in the state, Tucker fredrickson, went to the same school. The colleges used to come down and watch us play. And, uh, ol' tuck, he wound up at auburn, and i wound up at wake forest. Goodschool,niceplace. But,uh... Well, not exactly center ring. You understand? So i worked my tail off at, uh, forest. My senior year i led the nation in rushing and scoring. I mean, i led the entire nation. So i go look for a pro team, and i pick the bears. Now, who else comes to the bears? Mr. Sayers. Big guns, big school. I'm number two all over again. Well, ol' buddy, I'm number one guy now. But for all the wrong reasons. Unless you come back 100%, Well, people are gonna say piccolo got in on a pass. I'm gonna whip you, sayers. But you gotta be at your best, or it won't mean a thing. You're not gonna be one second slower or one degree weaker. I am gonna work your tail off to get that leg back in shape. For my sake. You got that? now for sports. In los angeles, the chicago bears... Trimmed the rams by a score of 17 to 16. Quarterback jack concannon was eight for fourteen passing, And the running game was ably manned by brian piccolo, Who gained 105 yards in 14 carries. Piccolowasawarded thegameball.

No. Actually, i want to talk to the both of you. Well, how things look this year, coach? Good. Real good. Matter of fact, there's one boy i'm very impressed with. I wouldn't be surprised to see him replace you as number two halfback. 'Cause i'm gonna make you number one fullback. Hey, pick! You and me, starting backfield! What do ya say?

Stick it in their ear! Good game, kid. Looking at you, i'd never know we won the game. I don't feel very much like i'm a winner about now. Why not? Gale, i'm sending brian piccolo back to chicago. He's not gonna finish the road trip with us. Ralph kurek's gonna start next week. Why? Because i've always had a policy on this team, Right from the start, the best players play, no exceptions. Rightnowkurek's thebestplayer. A lot of guys take a while to get started. Piccolo has never been one of those guys. He's always been in shape, Willing to give a hundred percent. But he's not doing that anymore. That's what worries me. idon'tknowwhatitis. Could be something physical, or it might be an emotional disturbance. - Something with his wife, children. - Pick? Come on! Well,something'stakenthe edgeoffofhim. Igottafind outwhatthatsomethingis. For his sake as well as the team's. When's he gonna find out? Abe's tellin' him now. That's why i didn't want you to go back to the hotel right away. Ah. I wouldn't want to be in abe's shoes right about now. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes about ten minutes from now. Who'd believe it? I mean, really, who'd believe it? Halas just wants you to see the doctor. Halas don't know what he wants. Gibron's his boy. You should have heard that lecture. Wants me to patch things up with joy. I say things are fine with me and joy. He just smiles that father flanagan smile of his... And tells me i shouldn't be afraid to level with him. Dear abby in a jockstrap. Pick,befair. Dr. Fox says... Hey, don't give me no crud About our great team doctor. Wants me to get a physical for the cough. No allergy. What is it, i say. He says, "well, it could be a virus. Could be a staph infection. Could be any one of a thousand things." Like being treated in a damn chinese restaurant. Two from column "a." Three from column "b." He's just tryin' to help. Yeah. Yeah. well, i... I guess you're right. It's all so pointless, gale. I mean, i know perfectly well what's wrong with me. Gale, i, uh... I think i'm pregnant. ** ** Yeah. Hey, coach. Which end of the field you want me to take if we lose the toss? Come in, gale. Close the door. We just got a call from the hospital. Brian piccolo has cancer. Oh, god. They've scheduled an operation for tomorrow morning. An operation to do what? Gale. They're gonna have to remove part of brian's right lung. thedoctors havenoexplanation. It's just something that brian carried around inside of him all his life. What kicked it off, they don't know. Whether or not they got it in time... Well, i'm afraid they don't know that either. Who's gonna tell them? I'll tell 'em. no. I'll tell 'em. you,gale? That's right, me. I'll tell 'em. Let's go. Let me have your attention a minute, fellas. Come on over here. Gale has something he wants to say to you. Gale. Uh... You, uh, all know that... We hand out a game ball to... The... Outstanding player. Well, i'd like to change that. We just got word... That brian piccolo is... That he's sick, very sick. And, uh, it looks like, um, He might never play football... Again. Or... For a long time. And... I think we should dedicate ourselves... To, uh, Give our maximum effort... To win this game... and give the game ball... to pick. We can all sign it... And take it up... To the hos... Oh, my god! fantastic! Couldyoubelieveit? Sayers,imean, you'vegotsomemoves onthefield, Butinthelockerroom, youareonebigklutz. Now, listen to me. Listen, now. When you dedicate a game to someone, You are then supposed to go out and win it, idiot. You know, pat o'brien never said, "let's blow one for the gipper." man, you is so bad. We probably would have won the game... If concannon had called that trap play more, But he sort of hates to call it without you in there for the repeat. Well. Gale. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm. Beats ham hocks, don't it? Ahh. Hey, anybody wanna see my scar? Out. Out, now. No discussion. Out. What's the matter? Why? What'd we do? We just got here. Thank you, gang. See you later, guys. Thanks for coming. You just gonna lay there? Hey, j.C., Hang on to this, will you? Later, pick. Oh, babe, uh, take gale down... And have him give that little girl his autograph downstairs. A little girl i met the day i came in. Had her operation the same day i did. Told her i'd get her your autograph. You don't mind, do you? No problem. I'll be glad to. All right. You go. It's time now, mrs. Piccolo. Thank you. I'll be right back. Won't ya? May i help you? My name is mrs. Piccolo. My husband's a patient on the third floor, And he told me about a little girl... Patti lucas... Who wanted this gentleman's autograph. Uh, mrs. Piccolo, patti isn't with us anymore. Oh. Well, do you have a home address? Mrs. Piccolo, patti's... My husband wanted her To have the autograph very much. Come on. Mrs. Piccolo, patti's dead. Shepassedaway earlythismorning. Nothing wrong with that knee, i'll tell ya. Congratulations, dr.Piccolo. Yeah. You know what, joy? I've been thinking. With gale healthy and ralph kurek healthy, I'm gonna have a real tough time getting back in that lineup next year. So, i was thinking, What's so difficult about being a kicker? I mean, i was just wondering if it was something you could teach yourself. Huh? 'Cause you don't need... A great amount of wind or stamina or size. Well, what do you think of my brainstorm, old gloomy gus? well, i don't know, brian. I mean, i'm no expert on kickers and things. You just ran an end run red grange would be proud of. Don't make fun of me, brian. I'm scared. - Well, what of? - "What of"? You can't be serious. You know perfectly well what of. No, i don't. I swear to god i don't, honey. Now, look, i'm, uh... I'm no idiot. This thing i got's bad. I know that. But, uh, well, it's just a detour, joy. I'm not gonna let it stop me. I'm just not. There's no way. I got too much to do yet, joy. pickitup!Pickitup, youdummy!Gale. now,mr.Piccolo, calmdown. "calmdown"? Howcanicalmdown? You'dthinktheball waswearingawhitesheet. Well, i was gonna catch it, but when it started coming down, i said to myself, "I wonder what pick would do in a situation like this," And dropping it seemed to be the answer. Well, at least you won the game. That's right. Yeah. And you didn't dedicate this one to me, though, did you? Nope. Dedicated it to butkus. - Why? - 'Cause he threatened us. how are you doin', pick, seriously? I, uh... I'm, uh... I'm hanging in there, magic. Just doing what they tell me to do. Hey, listen. You do me a favor, huh? You got it. Name it. Call joy, will ya? When she left here tonight, she, uh... Well, she was really down. I never saw her that down, you know? uh-Huh. I'll call her as soon as i get back. - Thanks, i appreciate it. - Okay. Bye. Phone call for mr. Sayers. Lady says it's an emergency. She seemed very upset. I'll take it. I hope i did the right thing. I'm sure you did. Thank you very much. Gale. Thank you. From joy piccolo. I know it's an awful thing to ask you to come back here in the middle of the night, but... It doesn't bother us, so don't let it bother you. Joy, why don't you just say it? They found more of the tumor. They, uh... They told me this morning that they want to operate again. Mm...
