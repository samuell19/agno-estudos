And the sister warms her up, while the guy gets his Shmuck ready. - Wait a second...l only got one, I didn't know you were coming. - I had breakfast already. Look, how pink... How nice, looks like Tina Russell's before the guy poked in his Shmuck! Looks good enough to eat. Ain't you gonna eat it? - Yeah, yeah after I finish dusting Well uh, yes that was an interesting motion picture from a, from a purely intellectual standpoint. - Also very horny! Last night when I got home I crept up the stairs, nice... Debbie was in bed reading... The first words out of her mouth Irving, don't start already! Today was my day at the hairdressers! - I may even write a book. Pornography in film, an intellectual study, the impact on modern man. - We spent the whole night under a tent. A tent with a throbbing center pole. Next time I'll bring my rain coat to the theatre Wear it in my lap, like all them other guys. That'll show her. That'll show her. We'll see how she likes sleeping under a tent with a chronically collapsed center pole. Don't tell me such movies don't turn you on. - L\/Ie? With all the action I get? - So? So what did you do last night? - Well last night it was June Madigan, again. - June Madigan?

You know, the one with the, handsome, scrapping steel worker husband. The one who is irresitably attracted to me - Married women, they are always dangerous. What if that goy, that steelworker should drop in unexpectedly. - A chance that must be taken. I am sure his disability pension would take care of him. Oh I am a coiled Cobra when I am surprised. Anyway like I told you before, June has been dying to get me and her together with her friend Agnes. You know the three of us in one bed together, you know? So... last night, Agne's husband was out bowling, and uh, Jesus - So who is watching the dry goods? - Oh I just dropped in for a minute, Mrs. Finkelfarb, to see how Melvin was doing. - Mmhmm.

For this you gave up college? Two more years and you would have been an accountant. - Ma, I don't want to be an accountant. - No you want to buy dreck, and sell hazarai. - Look Ma, buying dreck and selling hazarai, it gives me the few pennies lneed and the time I need to become a writer. - A writer? A writer he wants to become! At a time when people are only reading dirty books, like Portnoy's Complaint and the Charlie Chaplin report Ah, you have got a customer! Customers, huh, they got long hair, patched blue jeans, and holes in their undergarments I bet ya, Uh, the one with the beard is a boy, I hope.

Well I'm waiting master, to grant you the first of your wishes. - Well wait a minute, don't rush me. I mean a guy can't have the responsibility of five wishes being pushed up on him, just like that. - Yes kind and gentle master.

You need only command me. - Look my Mommas pushing me from one side, you gotta push me from the other? Jesus nobody can read, I got a closed sign out there! - Oh master, I must tell you, I'll have to hang around until your five wishes are used up.

I'm so glad we are alone. - You are? - Ah, Melvin, I have so much to tell you. It's so nice to have a friend, to be intimate with. - To be intimate with? - Someone you can feel safe with. Someone who's not going to make a pass at you every time you turn around. Ah, Melvin, Melvin. I found him! I found him. The man I was born for. - Another Doctor right? - A gynocologist. Dr. Vladamir Barker! My heart races when I speak the name. Feel! Feel it racing? - Oh it's racing, it's racing! Oh, it's me that's racing. - He's handsome, distinguished, he charges forty dollars a visit, no house calls. And he respects me as a woman. Not as something to paw and fondle. - Well, he sounds a, he sounds a, - Melvin you are such a great friend! I had to tell you. I've got to get back to work. - Dr. Vladamir Parker Obviously a pseudonym. Where did you come from? - I was hanging around. Boy do I ever love the way you rub the inside of my jar. - You mean you was here all the time? - Invisible. And now oh master, Your wildest desires are at your fingertips. You need only command. - Well..ok...ok, I want to go to bed with ah, with... Three girls, all at once. And I wanna be a doctor, and look like Harry Reems. - That's your wish? - That's my wish. - Alright. You must close your eyes. - Why must I close my eyes? - You must close your eyes for the spell to work. You're peeking! - Well uh, what's gonna happen so bad I can't see it? - Don't you want to look like Harry Reems? Be a doctor and go to bed with three girls at once? - Hey watch it with the spinning, I get sick to my stomach very easily. You're a phony genie, it didn't work. - Hi what happened to your voice, do you have a cold? - You're still a phony genie, I ordered three girls! - You poor dear, lie down, we will make you come- fortable. - That's more my style. - Melvin! What are you doing? - I am playing doctor with Suzy, Ona, and Edna Momma. - Melvin, it's time to go home. - I can't Momma, I am giving Edna a thorough internal. - What kind of meshuggeneh talk is this? You're gonna give Susan a thorough internal? - Momma, how did you get here? - I walked. I'm gonna take a subway for one block? - Where are the others? - Who would be here? Except Edna, Ona, and Susan? - Momma, why are you looking at me like that? - Do you feel alright Melvin? - I feel alright. - That's the way it was Sadie, he was on the floor, I don't know what to do. I think I hear him coming, let's talk about milk men. So Sadie, if you're not satisfied, take on my milk man. He's young, he's tall, he'll give the heavy cream like you never had before. I think he's gone now. Alright, yes. I am so worried about my Melvin, I just don't know what to do. What Sadie? Of course he knows if he plays with himself too much his brain will turn into overcooked Kasha. What else could a mother do but to tell him? - Melvin! Vos makhstu? - Fine. - What's wrong with you? - It's my mother, I think she is having an affair. - Your mothers not an old woman When we were in highschool, I used to have the roaring hots for her. Who is the lucky man? - Her milk man. - Petrosky, I know him. He's a shtarker, He's taking care of half the gals in the neighborhood. And, you're not the only one that troubles. I told you last week, my brother in law came over to spend a few days us. Such a loafer! Spends so much time on the sofa we are thinking about having him fitted for slipcovers. - All these years. Whole string of plumbers, TV repairmen, icemen, and she thought I never suspected it. Now it's Petrosky the milk man, and now she is already giving references of him to her friend Sadie. - What an appetite. It was five days before I knew the guy was growing a beard. He never gets his face from behind the plate. - Petroksy, he's young, he's tall, he's good looking, and on top of it all he gives them the heavy cream like they never had it before. - Petrosky, he's our milk man too. With his reputation, I might be worried. But he would be hard to find a day where my wife hasn't been to the hairdresser. Melvin, my boy, I have to get back to the store. - What is your desire master? - Don't you ever get back inside your bottle? - It's more fun hanging around. 'Sides, I can see when you're going to rub the inside of my jar. Not one of my previous masters ever rubbed the inside of my jar with such, such technique! Master, Master, what is your pleasure? - Well you see, there's this milk man, a plain ordinary milk man. - Oh you mean Petrosky? - Hey how do you know Petrosky? You haven't been shtupping him too? - What kind of a genie do you think I am? I only know of him because you have been talking about him. - You know you are sneaky, and I don't like the idea of you hanging around watching everything I am doing. Well hey, I told you not to follow me around. - Well I have to hang around within sight of myjar. - Well uh, make me into a milk man. - What do you want to look like? - Oh just your plain, average, everyday, handsome dog of a milkman. - You have to be more specific. - Wait a sec, I once saw a milk man in a film, and he shtupped everybody At one apartment building. By the time he reached the top floor, After taking care of all the ladies in the house, When he was giving his heavy cream to the bottom floor it had already turned into sour cream. - But what did he look like? It was this actor named John Ashton. Yeah he made it with these two great looking chicks. - So think about what he looked like, and close your eyes. - Oh darling, I could hardly wait until you made your delivery. Darling. I want your heavy cream. - I want some of your heavy cream too baby. - But I have to save some for my other customers - And don't forget Petrosky, I want some heavy cream too. - Momma, what are you doing here? _ Hmm, my big boy. Who would think by looking at him that he was Valedictorian for his graduating class of PS768 - Momma, you've gotta stay our of my fantasies. Momma, don't come near me I am your son Melvin. - Ah, Petrosky don't try to fool me, that tushy? That shmuck? That isn't my Melvin. Wouldn't I know? Haven't I powdered his tushy, and washed his little shmekala while he went tinkle in the potty all these years. - Momma, I grew up. - Petrosky? Give me the heavy cream. - OK Mrs. Finkelfarb, here it is. - Ugh it's butta, you've been bouncing and wiggling all day long you churned the thing into butta. - Sorry that's all the heavy cream I have left. - Petrosky. I want you should give me, your heavy cream. The way you do everyday, from the nozzle! - Momma, stay away from me. Momma, you're making me very dizzy. - Momma, you see, I think I am going to get a nosebleed, and it's all your fault Momma. And besides, that's incest! Momma, Momma! You know I bet that big mouth genie, gave her the address of wherever I was Uh, Momma? Have you ever thought of another man, since Papa died? - Why would I want another man? I always have you. Well yes Momma, but you see other men can give you compainionship. And, uh, and stuff. - Well what kind of companionship could those men give me that I don't get from my lady friends? - I knew I'd find you here. - Alright Shamus, you big dick. I hear you are looking for me. - You're right Bonita. - Well you got Clyde. But you'll never get me. - Stop, stop in the name of the law, don't do that. Don't it will blow your brians out and make an ugly mess. Give it to me, please, I've got something better. I've got something better for you. - Boy, that Tina Russell, and how about that Marc Stevens? Have you ever seen a schvonce like that one? - Well I don't know I haven't had any complaints you know. - Oh come on now Melvin, this is your old buddy you are talking to, Irving Stein. I remember you from the locker room at PS768 - Well yeah, that is before I got my B12 Shots. - You mean, now you got a schvonce like Marc Stevens? - Well what do you think it is June Madigan likes about me. - June Madigan, what do you mean the one with the strapping steel worker husband? - Yeah that one, what do you think she goes so crazy for? It ain't only my good looks you know. - I've gotta get back to work. - If Irving only knew. Hey wait a minute, didn't I just rub the inside of herjar yesterday? Why should I spoil that genie? I'll bet she's had five masters before me. Not one of them had a technique like me, not one. - What is your desire master? - Genie, I command you to make me a private eye like Marc Stevens. Oh and genie, I want Tina Russell as my partner - Alright Marc, now is the time for the big showdown. Oh dear, and I mean big. Let me just put my lips around that thing. Let me take the tip of my tongue and put it into the opening. Til' the juices just begin to flow. - Momma, what are you doing here again? - I'm watching! I might have have known I'd catch you here again. Listen, I don't mind a little hanky panky, But you and that little blondie, out of I wouldn't mention the name nights. Is making a bad habit out of this. - Ah hah! It was that big mouth genie who told you where I am. - Can I ask you a question maybe? Who is watching the store while you are playing the big shtupper? - Boy am I dizzy. Any minute now I expect a nose bleed. And it's all her fault. I've gotta find a way to keep her out of my orgies. - Melvin, oh I had to see ya. Debbie and I, what I fight we just had on the telephone. Oh, it's a good thing we were on the, phone and not face to face. Otherwise l...l mighta hit her. Then she woulda broken my nose and my collar bone, or something, She could hit a zets, that girl. Oy, I hate to come to you when I got troubles. - Well who else would you come to, what are friends for? I got problems with my mother. - You heard about the guy with the iron fist under the velvet glove? Debbie, she's got brass balls, under lace panties. - I strongly suspect that my mother is having an affair with some women. - At least they can't make her pregnant. - Momma? Momma, where are you going? - I'm going out, I have a date. - A date? A date with whom? - With the girls, Sadie and a new girl Nora, good night. - Momma I was hoping you would stay in tonight and play some canasta with me. - Oh I can't, I promised Sadie. - And Nora? - And nora. - Momma, if you go out, I am going to do something desperate. - Oh Melvin, I know what you'll do. You'll go out, you'll drink too much, you'll be sick, you'll come home, you'll kneel in front of the toilet and you'll throw your guts up all night long. Good night darling. - She's right. I'll go to Bernsteins, and I wont know when I've had enough, so I'll take that one more, Five malteds instead of four. And then I'll throw up my kishkas all night. Oy, why do I always take that fifth one? - Oh, oh my goodness, what is your desire Master? - Hey Mel, your ma called, the elevator in the building broke down. Oh pardon me, I didn't intend to interrupt something. - No ah, you didn't interrupt anything Irv. This is my friend. - Let me guess, June Madison? - No, no this is my friend Amara. - Amara? You never told me about her. You been keeping her to yourself? - Look uh, you think thats a girl right? Well that ain't any girl. - It's a guy? - No no, it's a genie. - It's a genie? Of course it's a genie, any fool can see it's a genie. - Oh great and kind master, prince of the universe. Command me, I am your slave. - Oh just one question, if I decide to take my friend along with me, do I use up only one wish? - Only one wish. - So uh, how would you like to be John Ashton for a couple of hours. - What do you mean? - Look I mean, you like shtupping right? Well stick with me and I'll get you shtupped. - I'll stick, I'll Stick! - Genie, I uh, I want my friend here to be John Aston, and I wanna be Harry Reems. - You know what might be a good idea? The two of you boys, with one very horny girl. - Hey you know that would be a good idea. - Yeah, but who should the girl be? - I only suggested this because, this has been one of my greatest fantasies. Two boys at once. - Hey wait a second, I know this girl Sandy, The one Tina Russell and I were involved with. - Tina Russell? You made it with Tina Russell? - Yeah and Sandy. - Close your eyes boys. - Melvin, where are we? - A place where they have orgies. - Where is it located? - I think it's in the same building I live in, three or four flights above. Wherever it is, it's easy for my mother to get here. - Ah Irving, boychick! I know you have always wanted me. 9h yes! - But what about Melvin? - Eh, let him watch, maybe he'll learn something. - Momma, how did you get here? Irving even told me the elevator was busted. - That was something. Now I've done something I have always wanted to do. Ball your old lady! And I was right, she's hot! Melvin! Boychicko! Your Mommy is some Tootsie! And that Sandy, it was just like the old days. Remember Ethel Pinsky, You used to take the back, I used to take the front. And then just like that latest Harry Reems picture with Tina Russell and what's her name. Your momma and Sandy they both dove at each others muffs! - Irving, one more word and I'll - What Melvin? - I'll never take you with me again, never, no place! - Now wait a minute, be reasonable, I was only kidding. Look the next time you are planning to take a little trip to that penthouse or whatever Just give me a little nudge and I'll be here. - Look I don't want any stories floating around Harry's delicatessen about my Momma. And if maybe Debbie got wind of it. - I hope I am not interrupting something. - No uh, come right in. - What a mob down the street. In front of the dry goods store, they are having a big sale! Everythings at half price! - Oh, I left my brother in law that, that bishcon, that rip off artist. To watch the store! - Uh, so Janet, how is your friend the gynocologist these days? - Oh, oh him. I'm through with him. He's only interested in, well... vaginas... Other girls vaginas. And anyway, I have met this most fascinating man! Harold Sampson - Harold Sampson, the insurance man? - You know him? Yeah tall, big hands, and not too good looking right? - No, no, no this one is very, very handsome. - Yeah well maybe, if you like the big biking type but not too many girls I know like a guy who wears a hat with horns and is always holding a weapon in his hands. - Oh so you do know him. You described him perfectly. - You mean he wears a hat with horns? - Nah, no, no, no, no, no He always, he's always... He's always got his weapon in his hands. Goodbye Melvin! - Oh, who is that running out of the store? Was that your red face? - A customer Momma - Melvin, I am not going to hear any stories about you if I go into Harry's delicatessen am l? It's enough his pastrami gives me a heartburn. Why don't you close the store today, you won't get any more customers. Stein's dry goods has a huge clearance sale on, the whole neighborhood's there. Oy, it's such a success, already they have given Irving Stein oxygen. And taken him away to the hospital in an ambulance. He was so overcome with the way they cleaned out his store. Twice they had to give him sedatives. When his brother in law passed close to him. I guess he was just so grateful for the way the young man ran such a sale for him. - Momma? Do you remember a Harold Sampson? - Harold Sampson? The big viking insurance man. Everybody knows him, he's a big schmoozer with the ladies. In this building alone, there must be three children, and they all look like him. Oy what a heart breaker Poor Myra Cluxturn, she was ready to leave Milton Until she found out that Harold was making whoopie with her daughter Joyce. And I heard down at Harry's delicatessen that he has a serious thing going on with Cynthia Schwartz Number 10B And they say she is pregnant now too. - Momma, I think I am gonna go to the movies. - No Melvin, you go to the movies too much, it's bad for your eyes. And your eyes are not so great. New prescriptions the past three years for your glasses? You know they say that certain things boys do make their eyes not so good. Melvin, you don't shake it too much when you make peepee do you? - Good night Momma! - What else could a mother do but to tell him? - Mrs. Petrovich, please restrain yourself. I have my reputation in the building to consider. - Mr. Gordon, is my policy ready for me yet? - Oh let's see, that's not yours and uh, that not yours. - I want this size. - Oh yes, I have it. I had your policy in my pants pocket all along. But my hands are full, won't you please get it? - Mr. Gordon? Do you have my policy ready? - Shortly, shortly Mrs. Holmes - What's Mrs. Petrovich doing down there? - Reading the small print Reading the small print. - I'll be behind my door. As soon as you have my policy ready. - As soon as I refill my pen sweet lady. Ah, ah! - I am here to take care of your inner most desires, sire. - Do you always have to creep up on me? - This is your last wish Master. - You don't have to remind me. - After this wish I shall disappear from your sight forever. Back into the dark recesses of my jar. Please master, would you grant me one moment? I face centuries of lonliness in my jar. - I'm sorry. - No, no there's nothing you can do about it. But in these last moments together, may I make a recommendation? Don't squander your last wish, choose your next partner well. Select someone who has some tender feelings for you Someone who really cares about you. Someone who could give you the ride of your life. - I don't want to go to bed with my mother - I'm not speaking about your mother. Merciful Master, what is your desire? - I, uh I want to be the kind of insurance man that Eric Edwards is. And I want to be chased by women like Tina Russell and Lynn Stevens. - You shall have your wish master But first there is something that I must tell you. And it's against all rules laid down for genies. I like you Melvin Finkelfarb I shall miss you very much. I love you Melvin Finkelfarb. Goodbye, I love you. I love you. - Amara, Amara? - I hope your pen is really full baby, you have a really big policy to write. - Ok baby, just let me dip it into the well. - Pardon me Mrs. Curt, I have to go see your neighbor Mrs. Benson I have to write up a new policy. I'll be back shortly. - Hurry back, I'll keep this seat warm for you while your away. - Is my policy ready baby? - I have it right here - Seems to be a few loopholes in my policy. I'd like you to plug up all my loop holes before you leave this afternoon. I want more baby. More. - Sorry darling. I've got to go re-write Mrs. Curts policy. - But you haven't finished plugging all my holes. - I'll be back. - Amara! Amara! Oh come on, I know your hanging around here. Amara?
