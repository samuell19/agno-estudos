My name is Bensington. I'm a professor of entomology here at ... University. More to the point, I'm a professor of apiology, or the study of honey bees. If you're watching this tape, it means you've somehow managed to survive the single worst biological disaster this planet has ever seen. You'll want to know how it happened. Why it happeneqd. Who caused it. I have the answers, I have the answers, because I caused it. I don't have much time. The world outside has gone to hell.The power went off for good this morning, the police and the military lost control a little while after that. There's riots and looting everywhere. It won't matter by tomorrow. Everyone will probably be dead by then. How did this start? I had no intention of ending the world. I wanted to help people. I actually thought I was doing good. That's why I sent my research assistant to a private facility in the Carribean a few weeks ago. Redwood. I trusted him implicitly. I had set up a special research facility on the island of San Marino in order to conduct my experiments outside the jurisdiction of the F.D.A. and the U.S. government. The actual work was being done by a group of exchange students, all of whom were gifted enough to handle the work, but once it became obvious things weren't developing as quickly as I'd hoped, it was time to have Redwood take over the project. Mr. Redwood? Hey, That's me. You must be Conner. Nice to finally meet you face-to- face. How was your trip? It was Very long. And tired. Ya but, Unfortunately, I don't have the time to be tired. Bensington has about a week before we have to show some sort of result to the investors. A week! That was my reaction, too. We've been e-mailing our data to Bensington from Day One. Surely, the professor knows we haven't perfect the formula yet ... Relax. We don't have to repopulate the world's entire honey bee population, we just have to show progress. And we will. Trust me. I'm sure you two have something in mind. Absolutely. Now, If you could just show me around and introduce me to the rest of the team ... Sorry where were are my manners. I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Here , follow me ... That's RANDY and STEVE. You wouldn't know it to look at them, but they're two of our best entomologists. Unfortunately, they're obsessed with soccer. Hey RANDY! STEVE! We'll be there in a minute! As soon as I beat him! See what I mean? I think I'm beginning to see why you're behind on the research. They're great scientists. Then, they should be in lab. They both just came off of a fourteen hour shift. Do you want to see the others? Well, That depends. On? Whether or not we'd be interrupting their Ping Pong tournament. I wouldn't go any further without protective clothing. I think you're both safe. I just used smoke on the hive. We've been raising our own colony to cultivate samples from. PAUL here is the beekeeper. All of the male drones are dead. So? Doesn't the hive usually kill off the males during the winter months? Or when there isn't enough food to feed the entire hive. The drones don't do anything except mate, there for considered expendable. See the hive's dying out. The same thing's happening here that's happening everywhere. Well, that's what we're here to fix, isn't it? I hope so.. Follow me the others are inside. This had all began because of the bees. At the turn of the new millennium, the world's honey bee population had begun to thin out. Pollution, changing climates, the spread of humanity cutting into the insects' prime real estate ... all of these things factored in as a threat to the species' survival. And without bees, many important plants and flowers were losing their sole means of pollination and reproduction. It seemed almost inconsequential at first, but it was already leading to bigger and more devastating consequences. And that's where I came in. I was developing a chemical agent known as "Herakleophorbia Four", or "HKP Four". If we could get it to work, it would augment the bees' genetic makeup and allow it to adapt to the world we were cluttering up. They would be bigger, stronger, able to travel further to pollinate their crops, able to endure the rapidly changing weather streams.If we could get it to work. This is the rec room. Unfortunately, as you can tell, our entertainment here is somewhat limited. Oh, This is CHARLIE. He's our maintenance man slash-caretaker- slash ... Slash-babysitter. If all of you are such geniuses, how come I'm the only one around here who can empty a garbage can? You can't do anything without my help. You deserve all the credit ... I don't need to be patronized. You're the new guy, huh? I guess I am. My name's ... Unimportant to me. I'm the janitor. I guess, if you need a light bulb changed, you can yell "Hey, you!" at me or something.That's what everyone else around here does. And don't walk around on the floor in here. I just mopped. CHARLIE's a little bitter. He's a good worker, though. He takes care of us. At least he wasn't playing soccer when we walked in. You seem to have some serious doubts about are research team. Very astute of you. You don't think we're doing Bensington's work? I think you guys need some proper motivation. Define "motivation". I'll define it later. Right now, I want to see your lab. Mr. Redwood ... Look, your boss is thousands of miles away. You're working with a bunch of grad students fresh out of a classroom. Some of you are taking this seriously, some of you aren't. I get that. I understand that. None of us want to lose our jobs! We'll see what happens ... I heard our new boss just arrived. I'm ANNA. Uh, You can call me "Redwood". And I'm not the boss, I'm just here to get things back up to speed. I was about to take Redwood to the lab. LEWIS is in there. I'm sure he and our charming guest will have much to talk about. LEWIS is our top biochemist. Head of the research team. He's the one you won't have to worry about taking this seriously. He spends every waking moment in there, studying on Bensington's formula. He might as well move in there, as far as I'm concerned. We'll talk more later, after you get settled in. I look forward to it. To the lab, then? Of course. So "ANNA", huh? That's LEWIS' girlfriend. Great Just what we need around here: Some more drama. Well What about LEWIS? I doubt he knows he has a girlfriend. The lab's right through that door. You can ask him yourself. You're not joining us? Three's a crowd. Anyway, LEWIS is the one you came here to see. Whatever it is, I'm afraid it'll have to wait. I'm afraid it can't. Forgive me! I heard you were coming in today, I must've lost track of time ... I'm LEWIS ... So I hear. I'm Redwood. Yes, of course. It's an honor to finally meet you. So this is where the magic happens? Not as much as I'd like. It's lot of responsibility for one person. Oh, You haven't met the others! Oh I have. That's why I say "one person". So far, the only people that are working on the formula are you and the beekeeper. You must realize this is a very unique situation, Redwood. I mean there college students, they're working on a diploma, not so much a scientific breakthrough. Why are you doing it? This is my life's work. Those are four fresh test subjects. Female workers, PAUL gathered them from the hive this morning. I'll be giving them doses of HKP Four, tagging them, then releasing them back into general population. Now If every thing works, they'll be able to release the chemical to the rest of the hive through their pheromones. Why not the queen? The queen uses pheromones to suppress hive activity or entice mating. The female workers spread the dose equally to the rest of the hive so the entire hive gets the same dose. And you think this variation of HKP Four will actually work? I've only seen the computer mock- ups. On paper, it works. I need results by next week, LEWIS. I don't need a hive of super- bees, I just need some positive results. Hive growth. Resistance to temperature changes. Just Something. With all due respect, even if this works better than expected, it is very unlikely that you will see results with in a week! Your right ! Of Course! Hey You, Mind if I call out on the satellite phone? I wasn't able to reach anybody from home when I got to the airport. I just want to call my mom, let her know I got here okay Ya, it's right there. Thanks. Alright REDWOOD! Hello? Hi, Mom! It's me! I just wanted to let you know I arrived in San Marino okay. I assume somebody's listening in on this call. Sorry about the static. You never can tell with this international phone service though.. Okay. You're at the lab, right? Pretty much. But, The weather here's a little iffy, How "iffy"? I just saw a seven- day forecast and it doesn't look good. Probably rain. They have nothing we can show the investors? No. Hmmm.. I guess We're going to have to go with Plan "B". You have my new additive with you, right? I never go anywhere without my insulin kit. Good boy. I want you to inject twenty units of the additive into the test subjects' food supply. And for God's sake, be discreet about it. You don't want me to share those cookies you made with everybody else? Absolutely not, Redwood. For now, I want this to be completely top secret. Give the bees the additive, let LEWIS think he's feeding them his latest batch of HKP Four and get back to me as soon as we have some valid results. Are we clear? Ya, Mom. Ok I love you, too. So, How are things back in America? Oh, you know how parents are. Over- protective. Ya, Oh, you're a diabetic? Ya, Oh, Yeah, Mom was insistent that I had to take my insulin. I got to get a fresh batch of HKP Four from the refrigerator down in the rec room. Do you mind watching over the test subjects until I get back? Sure. Alright, The formula takes a while to get through their system, and even then, if there's any results, they're minimal ... Are they feeding? They appear to be ... No ...! What happened? The formula killed them. What? They're dead. It didn't give them a lethal dose. I don't understand ... Are you sure they're dead? They're bees. They don't remain motionless like this unless it's extremely cold or they're dead. So, Calling your "mother" again? Actually, no, I'm trying to call Professor Bensington. There's no answer. Give me some credit, Redwood. I know exactly formula, and I know none of it is capable of killing a Bee What did you do to them? Look, I realize you're under a lot of pressure, okay? But the last thing I would do here is kill off the test subjects. Blame one of your non-existent co-workers. Blame the variables you introduced . But don't blame me. Is that why you're calling Bensington? I'm calling Bensington because this entire operation is now on the line? It's The professor's money is what's running this place! Do you want to look over my notes, see if we can trace the problem back to its source? I don't know what it is get through right now. It could be the time difference, bad weather. Whatever it is, before we do anything else, I need to talk to the professor. Are we clear? Yes. So What do you want me to do in the meantime? Just Pray that I don't ask you to drive me to the airport. Man, it's hot out here. I gotta take a shower. Otherwise, I'll be spending all night in the lab stinking. Ya, Like you do at soccer? I'm serious man! Suit yourself. Well , You coming? Maybe later. I still have to work on my moves. Well , You know where to find me! What! Ahhhh.. I guess you've decided to stop talking. Wise decision, my friend. Well, While you're back there, you mind scrubbing my back? Cold hands ... What happened to you ...? Ahhh.... Redwood? Hey, I had to pretend the satellite phone was on the fritz earlier , otherwise every one would have been calling you themselves. Cant believe I got ahold of you by cell phone ... Why are you calling me? Your "additive" Well it didn't work. What? It killed four test subjects. And we're damn lucky it killed them right away to otherwise they would have taken out the rest of the hive, as well. You wouldn't have anything except a bunch of dead bees to show your investors. That shouldn't have happened. Ya, I'm aware of this. Do you think it interacted with the HKP Four? No, it didn't. You sound pretty sure about that. PROFESSOR .. What aren't you telling me? Have LEWIS e-mail me the data on the dead test subjects. I want a complete workup, down to the smallest detail. I want it by tonight. Professor, you can't send me thousands of miles, have me be responsible for destroying years worth of work and just expect me to .. I expect you to do what I tell you, Redwood. No more, no less. You want a degree, I want to continue my research. At this point, this is the only way to do it. Have LEWIS e-mail the data. And do whatever you have to do to keep them happy and working until I say otherwise. You have to come with me to the lab. Why? We have a problem. STEVE! STEVE! Mother of god! Thank God! We have to get inside quickly! There is something horrible after me ...! What's wrong with you? Didn't you hear me? What's happening ...? Ahhh.... So, What did you have to talk to me about? Like I said, there's a problem. Shortly after you and I left the lab today, I found this ... What is it? The test subjects were gone. I don't follow. So Did one of the other students come in here and ... what, take the bees? I have no idea. Four dead honey bees couldn't have possibly opened this glass cannister by themselves. Okay. Let's get the rest of the team in here and ask them if they know anything about it. I'm asking you. What did I do? Things have been going badly since you arrived. We are actually further behind now than we were before you got here. What's to prevent you from stealing the test subjects and bringing them back to America for your self? We're all on the same team, LEWIS. Look I need your expertise here. So does the professor. So, Then, why did you lie to me about calling the professor? I think you're keeping things from me. Look, At the end of the day, I'm just a college student, same as you. I wish I was part of some big conspiracy. Then, I wouldn't have to travel halfway across the world to earn a passing grade. We need to talk to the others. Maybe it was just an accident ... CONNER's Getting for them now. Go get some rest, Redwood. There's little else you can do at the moment. And the next time you talk to Bensington, I want to be there. I thought you might need a drink. And some company. And I thought you'd be hanging out with LEWIS. As I said, he lives in that lab. He's obsessed. You don't share his enthusiasm? I'm here because of him. And It's a great opportunity, I suppose, but I don't think we see things quite the same way. What about you? Me? I just want a degree. Otherwise, I'd still be waking up at three in the afternoon and skateboarding up and down Venice Beach. YA.. You know the others they don't trust you. I can see why. How do you feel about me? I feel you would be an Extremely nice change of pace. You guys got Room for one more? RANDY? STEVE? Where the hell are you guys? You're supposed to be in the lab! What Are you guys hiding out in here? Look, if it were up to me, you guys would have the day off. LEWIS wants everybody in the lab. I was hoping I'd find you still alive. I really missed your people skills, CHARLIE. What can I do for you? Yesterday, I heard STEVE screaming in his room. I went up to see what was wrong. STEVE was gone. I found this instead. What is it? Look for yourself. After I saw it, I spent the rest of the day locked in the broom closet. Today, I'm leaving this place. And if the rest of you were smart, you'd follow me. You brought death with you. Is that ...? One of the test subjects. YA, It still has traces of the paint marker you put on it. How could this happen? I was hoping you could tell me. If I had to guess, I'd say the test subjects must have grown to enormous size, broke out of the glass cannister and crawled out of an open window. It gets worse. CHARLIE said he heard STEVE screaming yesterday. When he went to STEVE's room, this is what he found. STEVE was gone. Where is STEVE now? This is your research team. The stinger's gone. Ya, That's what killed it. So the bee stings STEVE, dies ... And now STEVE is gone. We can round up the others and go looking for him. If he's still alive, which I doubt, he's not here, or we would have seen him by now. He probably wandered off into the jungle. We wouldn't be able to find him without a tracker. Where's everybody else? Probably Sleeping getting ready for their next shift or working around the compound. Ka, I don't want anyone outside. If the other subjects are like this, we're in great danger. We have to get in touch with Bensington, then. Ya, What's that going to do? I'm pretty certain you and him are responsible for this. You think I could have done something like this? Not on purpose, but, yes. I think you had something to do with the test subjects dying. And whatever killed them turned them into some sort of mutant. I know about as much as you do, okay? Ya, Forgive me if I don't believe you. We have numerous problems here. First and foremost is, there's three more subjects like this flying around the compound. Everyone here is fair game. What's to prevent them from just flying away? Their Bee hive is still here. If they still behave like they did before becoming mutations they may be close to it. But them attacked STEVE, however, may have made them aggressive . They may attack animals or humans not directly threatening their hive. And the other problems ...? We haven't found STEVE. I agree. He should have went and got some medical help.. No, I mean, we have found STEVE's body. There may be enough bee venom in him to take down a full-grown elephant. God! The Bee's were dead before they grown to this size, So what ever made them grown to this size Maybe transferred to another host by fluid transference. STEVE may be infected, And not dead. Your saying it could have turned him into something like this? It may affect humans differently. HKP was tailored specifically for honey bees. I mean what ever is in their didn't turn him into a Giant if that's what your worried about. What should I be worried about? I don't know what happened to the bees, I'm not sure until I perform an autopsy on this specimen and run some tests. Can't we start a bonfire or something? Use smoke to drive them away ...? Beekeepers use smoke to diffuse the queens pheromones and keep the hive from attacking. We would need extreme cold, fire or some sort of grade A insect poison. Ok I have to call Bensington ... Redwood? Where is my data? Your about to be getting a lot more than you bargained for. Explain. Long story short: your "additive" caused the four test subjects to mutate into giant killer bees. One of the grad students might be dead or infected with something. Which is a mood point, because the three killer bees that haven't stung anybody they somehow managed to get outside and could be anywhere right now. Dear God ... What was in that bottle, Professor? You need to tell me ... I ran tests ... I was certain the additive wouldn't have any detrimental effects ... What was it? It was a substance recovered from a meteorite. What?!? Last year, a meteor crashed in the Mojave Desert. A N.A.S.A. team was doing a survey and discovered it. There was unusual plant growth around the crash site - plants that hadn't grown in that region for thousands of years. It was determined that a mixture of unique chemicals and radiation from the meteor somehow stimulated biological reproduction. I was part of the research team that examined it, so I altered the formula and tested it out on insect cells. I thought it was a shortcut to make HKP Four actually work! Yeah. It worked, all right. You sent me out here to die, just like you sent these students out here to die. My research was sound! Nothing like this should have ever happened! Well, now I'm outside of my area of expertise, Professor. What's the plan? This is what I want you to do. Pack up the dead test subject and evacuate the entire team. I can have the local government over there quarantine the entire area and destroy the other mutations. What if it's too late? Let me worry about that. You worry about getting everyone else out of there as soon as possible. Let me worry about that ... What did Bensington say? We're on our own. What about this specimen? That's the least of our worries. Bensington's probably going to have this entire compound quarantined. We'll be lucky if they don't call in an air strike on this place. What about us? We'll have to get somewhere safe. You take one half of the compound, I'll take the other half. We'll round up everybody and hightail it out of here. There's something you need to know about this specimen. Tell me later. Right now, track everybody down. If someone's infected, we'll have to leave them. And if you see one of those things coming for you, get inside. I'm going to try to find something we can use as a weapon. Stupid college students. Giant bees! Why did it have to be giant bees?!? I see one of you finally got smart. It's a long way back to town, though. You might want to put on some shoes on! It looks like the bee's got you. Where is everybody?!? What happened? Are you stung? Ahhhh... What happened? Did you get stung? No! Bitten! We'll have to stay inside. That door should hold them off ... Right! What happened to them? The bees. They died, they mutated and then they came back. When they transferred their venom to a human, the same thing must have happened. There's no blood. It didn't even break your skin. Is that what's going to happen to you? I have no idea. I'll try calling the police, get some help in here... No one's going to be able to get in here. Not with those mutations. I'm not going to make it, anyway. Listen ... if you make it out of here, there's something you have to know about the giant bee. I did an autopsy on them. And come to find out the size isn't the only thing that was mutated. I don't follow. Those Are female worker. Without pheromones from the queen, they could potentially lay eggs. Eggs? Those mutations are all carrying fertilized eggs. If one of them escapes ... Listen to me. The bee's venom has turned the students into some sort of mindless zombies. I'm not going to make it out of here alive. Take LEWIS' research Ahhhh ... That was the last words I ever heard from Redwood. I can only assume he was killed. We know now that the mutated insects were carrying fertilized eggs, and that once those eggs hatched, a monstrous swarm overtook the island. Then, the South Pacific. Asia. Europe. And finally, here. The cold doesn't stop them. Lack of a food source doesn't stop them. Nothing stops them. They have become monsters, and they have taken over the world. I've held them off for as long as I could. I'm sorry ... Ahhhhh......
