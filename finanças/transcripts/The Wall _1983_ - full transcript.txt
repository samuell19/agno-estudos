PENITENTIARY PRISON Radio advertisements... Now I'm announcing the list of people going to the court tomorrow... This dormitory does not look like others... After the director and the guardians, the chief is God here. He's called "Forty-one" and is the leader. He's the bird and sells the grass to the guardians. He sells children to the other dormitories. Some of the children go cleaning to the other dormitories. They go as men and come back as gay, be careful. You'll be fucked, too. Pay attention to your shoes and socks, they can be stolen. Here is the 4.dormitory, the law here is like that. We've some bullies here, one of them is Aziz. Beside him is the "Tall". He's a great pickpocket. He's the "Arab". He killed the man disturbing his mother. - 'Thank God I am well. ' Did you write it? - I did. My only worry is you, my dear dad. Write to me. Send some money What did you write? Read it. My dear father firstly I send my regards and kiss your hands. I wrote nine letters including this one to you... ...but I couldn?t get any answer... ...if you ask your son... ...Saban thank god I am well... My only worry is... ...you, my dear daddy, write to me and send some money. Is that all? That's all. Daddy, I've been in prison for 153 days What else? The moon. My God, please send me to me to a better prison. Me, too. Amen. These are all for a hero of a bad novel. Any fool can kill himself whenever he wants to. What's easier than this? This is the poorest and the easiest way. Life is getting difficult, so let's suicide. Did you try to overcome all these difficulties? Without control you can?t pass. Sakin Orman, dormitory 1. Pepe Ali, which dormitory? Ali Yilmaz, dormitory 3. Huseyin Karakus, dormitory 2. Is there anything inside? No. It's only warning practice. Welcome, sir. He's coming here. Quick. Quick.

There is iron in lentil and is full of calories. Isn't it, children? Yes, sir. How many cooks do you have? One civil cook and two helpers of prisoners. And we have children. Good, very good. But our cauldrons are old and not enough. We're trying to handle it. Sure, you have to. Without doing economy we can?t make progress.

What kind of an answer is this? - Sorry. - You, sons of bitches. You say sorry, just this. You, bastards, is this an answer? Lentil should fuck your mothers. Don't, sir. Don't. Fuck you. Fuck your mother. Do you hear me? You, fool. You, shit. - What should you say? - I don't know. - You don't know what to do. - I didn't do anything. - Anything? - No, sir. It's time to do anything to this bastard. Are you crazy? They'll kill us. Doesn't matter. Attention. Search everybody. Yes, sir. Searching. Go to the wall. - Is the listening line functioning? - Partly, sir. But the guardians listen to everything. It's very noisy and everyone speaks loudly here. Empty your pockets. Take out your shoes. Put everything on you here. I wish you a good day. Thank you. Who is this woman? A teacher. Her crime is politic. Forbidden books and announcements are found in her house. Who is this child? She's born in our prison and will start school on Monday. Good. Very good. Dear sir, they say there will be dismissal because of the celebrations of Ataturk's birth year. May's passed.

They can handle it as everywhere. If you have money you can stay in a good dormitory. Or you can buy a bunk in front of the window or visit the bath whenever you wish. And we're stinking and every week they examine lice. Why do they do this, I don't understand. If you don't wash you get lousy. If you get lousy the guardians hit you. It's impossible to live here. Did we invite you? Did we say " your bath, your bed, your food is ready for you" Did we promise you all these? Don't forget, you're prisoners. But not slaves. Dear sir, is there a dismissal? There is no dismissal. Everyone should stay till the end of his punishment. You know how to talk. You have to know also how to be imprisoned. If you're guilty you'll be punished.

I'm writing a petition. I've asked for the Izmit prison. I've written also for 'Stupid'. Tomorrow he'll have the court but he's asked for it. Why Izmit? If you look through the window you can see the main street. Taxies, oars, busses, trucks, you can even see the sea. You'll see the sea like this. Yes, but not so much like here. Not true. In every prison they beat the children. I've been grown up in reformatories, brother. Don't tell me stories. It's the same there, isn't it, Saban? For sure. In everywhere it's the same for children, isn't it? Yes, it's the same. I'm fed up with being a child. Where? My children, how are you? What are you doing? Uncle Ali, uncle Ali.

If they've no intention to take a bath, what do '10 bucks' mean? Is it right? Yes, chef. Ask once who's got ten liras? Most of them have not even money for tea. Or for a stamp for the letter. We're sixty people. How many of us have visitor? Shut up. Whom are you talking to? No one. Tell me, bastard, what are you doing if you've louse? I take a bath, sir. I take it with cold water.

We don't want you anymore. Am I fired? No, I'm just taking you away. Get out. Tell your problem at the court. This idiot Saban has wasted the plan. Saban is dead. I learned that. And Ziya? Ziya's gone. Aziz is with you. He says he ruined everything. He's angry to Ziya too. And you? Me too. You said we would run away together. When Saban began to run to the court, I was panicked. We didn't have a penny. Neither Ziya nor me. I'll shoot Cafer. Do not hurry. They gave 15 days of sentence. Wait for me. I have a new idea. A new way. A mutiny... If we rebel they take us to another place. And we'll shoot Cafer together in the mutiny. And other boys will also be with us. Some of them will not be interested. We'll shoot them all. Attention! Today you are going to give... blood for the Red Cross although there is no necessity... to give blood is sacred for every Turc Is it good now, you idiot? Was it easy to run away? They've brought Ziya. Where did you go? Tell us. Hey, wake up... Take him out. Hey boys, come and help us. Come on... They've beaten me so much. And Saban? Saban is dead. They've also caught the Tall. He is at the cell now. Did you see Karabas? No. They've poisoned her. The municipality police did. There is no where left in life for us. No place. If I've had parents I would stand this sentence even for 100 years. 100 years. Karabas is dead. And there is nobody left who loves me. We have decided to rebel with the friends. Maybe they take us to a better prison. Even if we are not successful, the children after us... ...will be safe. They'll change dormitory 4. I don't think so. Dormitory 4 will never change. There's no life outside. Nobody cares for anybody. Everybody runs for something. Where do they run? My mother called me 'my bird, my peasant'... She used to caress me with love... She was so kind to me... And now Karabas is also died. And no body's left to hold my hand... guardian. What? The boy is sick. It's very serious. What does he have? I don' know. He can't speak. The runaway kid is very sick. But he is dead. Look at him. He is cold. - Where do you take a dead man? - To the hospital. Gendarme. Ask the boy if he has money. If so take a taxi to the hospital. What taxi? He is dead. What? Is he dead? Gendarme. Who is the one taken out from the infirmary? Is he the one who came today? I don't know. You'll learn it tomorrow. alert. alert. There is mutiny in the anarchists? dormitory. There is mutiny at dormitory 6. We have informed gendarme, sir. All right, sir. There may be run away. The director follows all closely, sir.

Tonight is the night of destiny for us. When we get Cafer it will be OK. According to our plan Garip will cause a fight with the man at the bath. He'll shoot him. We shall be calling help from the window. Of course Cafer will come firstly. When he enters, I... Tom and Birol, will attack him at both sides. The fat, Necdet, Nadir, Sukru will close the gates. We'll put the beds against the doors. Uzun will call the dormitory to the mutiny. guardian. guardian. There's mutiny. - Why are you shouting? - mutiny. What? Alert. This is a mutiny. Beds to the gates. Put them against the windows. This is our last chance to change. The boys at the 4th dormitory have rebelled, sir. They want to kill Cafer. To transfer to another prison, sir.
