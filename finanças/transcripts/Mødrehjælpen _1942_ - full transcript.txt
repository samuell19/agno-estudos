GOOD MOTHERS The Mothers' Aid institution is based on client confidentiality, so the participation in this film has been entirely voluntary. Babies' linen drying like tiny flags and pendants, floating merrily, nothing out of the ordinary, saluting a small nation, a nation of little ones, of children. Of children behind bars, children in cages, children in short trousers, children in petticoats. Children, children, children. All brought into this world under the patronage of the Mothers' Aid institution which assists mothers. There is a special law which says assistance must be given to every mother who needs help, whether they are married or not. Mothers' Aid has branches all over the country and it is easy to get in touch with them. From the seven head branches social advisors are sent to 63 other places. MOTHERS' AID OFFICE HOURS 12-2 This chair is in a way a symbol of the institution. It is ready for any woman who is in need of help. WAITING ROOM Last year 37,400 women applied for aid. They come from all classes of society. And it is a misunderstanding to think that only unmarried women are granted the support of the Mothers' Aid institution. They come confident in the knowledge that nothing of what they confess will be disclosed to anybody outside the institution. Young women have been prevented from acting with undue haste because they no longer felt that they were alone. Behind each of these doors is a chair waiting for women in need of help. Let's hear one of those women unburdening her mind. - Christian name? - Erna. I have been to see a doctor, but he wouldn't... What did he say? He gave me this card and said I should go and see you. Listen, you must help me. I'm in such despair and if you won't help me, I shall have to find someone who will. No, don't do that. You might ruin your health. Besides, you run the risk of being punished. Yes, but it is all so hopeless. We shall do the best we can to help you. I understand, you want me to have the child, but I don't want to. Let the doctor have a look at you first. But why won't you have that child? You are in good health. But how will I cope on my own? Haven't you got a job? Yes, but I shall lose it when they hear my story. I'm sure we can help you return to work. Oh, what am I to do? You must have that child. No. Think how a child would tie me down. And it would be unfair on the child, too. What about the father? I won't have anything to do with him. He has been too mean to me. And I can't be alone with a child. Someone will adopt it. We can arrange that for you, but have the child first, and then we'll see if you wish to give it up. No, it's of no use. Listen, why don't you think it over? And come back to discuss the matter. Please, do. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Erna has listened to reason and has decided to give birth to her child. She is examined and attended to by a midwife and a doctor, all free of charge. Last year almost 3,000 consultations were given to both married and unmarried women. Erna has become calm and confident. She takes great interest in learning how to look after her baby. A whole new world is about to reveal itself to her. She thinks about herself less. This doll here is called Petra. She has the great advantage that she neither cries nor kicks. It's difficult enough as it is. Yes, that's better. While Erna prepares for the birth of her child, the Mothers' Aid institution takes the father in hand. He, too, has something to learn. He is not allowed to run away from his responsibilities. Even in these matters, many young women need help. For the last six weeks before the birth, Erna lives in a home for expectant mothers. Here she is shielded from any teasing and taunting. In the country's main hospital, Erna brings her child into the world and here her baby cries for the first time. In a home for mothers and their babies, Erna and her child spend the first months after the birth at no expense to her. Last year these homes gave shelter to 250 mothers with new-born children as well as 1,000 other children temporarily taken care of. Erna's baby is much better nursed than it would have been at home. Twice a year the home holds christenings for the babies. It is a great event for everybody. The ceremony must be recorded for eternity. Here is the photographer. Erna has resumed normal life. How do you do? There he is, the little chap. What a fine boy. - What is his name? - Christian. His name is Christian. How do you do, Christian? Now, what about having him adopted? - No, I want to keep him. - I knew you would. Christian grows up. Mothers' Aid teaches Erna to make toys out of discarded material. It is incredible how much you can get out of so little. Remnants of wax cloth can be turned into a giraffe. This one is called Mrs Upright. What could this be used for? For a village church. Christian will certainly not get bored. Erna learns also to sing simple children's songs and in turn she teaches them to Christian. Poor little Negro boy He is black from tip to toe That is how he always has to go Poor little Negro boy Erna falls on hard times and Christian needs some new clothes. But for that, too, Mothers' Aid has the remedy. Last year 32,000 items of children's clothing were distributed. Christian before. Christian after. Spring smiles on Erna and she smiles on her Christian. She now has something to live for - a home and a child. THE END
