'Cause I know y'all's making it. ♪ Gonna be all, gonna be alright. ♪ - Tell me why they denied my vacation request. - First of all, good morning. - Well, it's not a good morning to me. - What's going on Renee? - This stupid office and their stupid rules. They're gonna deny my vacation request for the Friday after Thanksgiving? - Did they say why? - She's talking about that I don't have enough days, even after I already told her that you approved it. - Okay, so who denied it? - Mary. - Give me a sec. Yeah, call her. - This is Mary. - Yes, Mary, this is Kelly, your office manager. I have Renee standing here at my desk and she stated at you denied her vacation request after she told you it was already approved by me? - Yes, Kelly, that's true, but Renee has already used all of her personal and vacation days. - Yes, I understand that, but I approved it. So I'm telling you as your manager to place the approval slip in her files, okay? Thank you. - How am I ever gonna be successful at my job if she keeps overriding everything I say? - You must talk to her and tell her how it makes you feel. - She's never gonna listen. Excuse me. - All done, it's approved. - That's what I'm talking about. Ain't nothing like having your girl as a boss. - Look, I do not understand how you be out there in all that mess. - With finances like mine, you have to go to Black Friday for that free TV, that Keurig. - And I'm pretty sure it's Keurig. - Whatever Kelly, thanks boo. - Keurig. - Hey, what was that all about? - Oh, Mary tried to deny my vacation time. I had to get my girl Kelly to put her in her place. - I wish Kelly was my supervisor. She seem real cool. - Yeah, that's my girl. Uh oh, here come your boy Thirsty Rick. I'm bout to act like I'm doing some work, you can listen to him. - You wrong. - Hey Renee. - No Rick. - Why is she always acting busy when I come around? - Probably 'cause she don't want to be bothered with you, bro. Just give it up, Rick. - So Julie, are you still not wanting to know if you're having a girl or a boy? - Oh girl, no, I definitely want to know and I'm really hoping for a boy. I just want my family to be complete. - Oh, that'd be so perfect. - Right, you have your girl and your boy done and out of the way. - That's what I'm talking about. - Oh, I'm so happy to be a teetee again. - A teetee? When are you gonna join the club and be a mommy? - Right, come join the club. - Trust me, that won't be happening any time soon. - Why not, Kelly? - Tasha girl, me and Stan have too much going on to be bringing an innocent child into this mess of a life of ours. Girl. - Anyway, how is baby boy doing at his new school girl? - He is doing so good. He is making so many new friends. He even got invited to a birthday party next week. He is so excited about that. - That's so good, Tasha. I'm so happy to hear that. Yeah. - I think I'm done with it. I really need to sit down. So I'll take it. - Uh uh, girl, go ahead, I'll take care of this. - Thank you, girl. So ladies, what are you asking Santa for for Christmas? - Girl, I'm not asking Santa for anything, but I'm asking Jesus for a new husband. - Kelly, what are you talking about? - Clearly, there is something you need to get off your chest. What is it? - So y'all know how close me and Stan used to be. We were like Bonnie and Clyde, baby. But since I've given my life to Christ, it's like we can't see eye to eye on anything. Really? - Girl, it's gotten so bad, I can't even stand to see him walk in the room. - Oh my God, so what you gonna do, girl? - Have you all thought about counseling? - Girl, please, Stan ain't gonna step foot in nobody's church, let alone counseling. - Well go to a counselor that's not at the church. - I've been married to the man long enough to know he is not going for it. - Happy holidays, ladies. - Mommy, mommy, daddy got me an apron. - Oh really? Look at that. Now you get to help mommy cook in the kitchen. Will you put it away for me? - Yes. - Thank you. - That is so sweet. James, you're such a good dad. - Hey Kelly, tell Stan I said, if he thought last year's turkey was banging, this year, he's gonna bite his fingers off. - Hey, if it's better than what it was last year, I might bite my fingers off too, shoot. - You just might. - My God. - Y'all are still coming to Friendsgiving, right? - Girl, I guess. - You better. And don't forget about the theme this year. - We are, okay? Great. - I gotta go. Sorry, I got to head out. - Did I interrupt something? - Uh uh, no you fine, I just got to pick up a couple of things before I head home. - I'm gonna go ahead and head out with Kelly. Okay. - Oh don't y'all forget to mail your check in and your contribution. - Already done. - Thank you, much! - Hey, thanks ladies so much for helping me out today. - You're welcome. - All right girl. - Bye. - Did I just walk in on something? Is something going on? - Nothing, just girl talk. Did you bring me something? - We keeping secrets now? - No, babe, Kelly going through things with Stan. You know how it is. - Look, Kelly's not going through anything with Stan. Kelly going through it by herself. - Why would you say that? - Kelly and Stan were doing just fine before Kelly got all into church like that. She needs to let that man be. And you know what? The same way God was all patient and long suffering with her, she need to extend that same graces. If you remember, Kelly ain't always been saved. - Mommy, can we bake cookies now? - Yeah, let's go wash our hands and we will bake those cookies. - Hey Boo. - Hey. - Is everything okay, out here? - Yes. - Good, good, good, good. Oh girl, make sure you check out on the lipstick line. We got some colors that will pop on you. Welcome ladies to the grand opening of Nettie Kelly. I see you divas finally made it. - Yes we did.

So y'all honestly don't think that it's possible to be happily married? No. - Absolutely not. I mean you can pretend to be, but you're not. - Well wait a minute, wait a minute, now wait a minute. God... You all really going to sit here and tell this man that he could not be married? Happily married? - Yeah. - To his wife, his true love. - Hey look, Jesus, let me tell you from me and Kelly stand point. Enlighten me. - Look man, at one point in our marriage, I can honestly say that we was happy. But right now I can't say the same thing. So check this right, I just don't understand how is it that we can go from doing everything up under the sun together, to now, its like we hate each other. Look bro, I can tell you that she hate the sight of me coming, and to be honest the feeling is starting to become mutual. - And you know, I feel you man, cause you know, everybody know my situation. Me and EB, she crazy as all get out. Crazy. - I mean when we good, we good. But when she started that woody woo woo, it's bad. The who? - Hey, but it's 50, 50, it wight itself out. So I take it. - Well shoot, You know my wife, she a workaholic bro. So that kinda worked out for the both of us. You know what I mean? Man I don't know if she happy or not. So I guess I'm safe. - Safe? Man its not safe, matter of fact you tripping. You better know if your wife happy or not man. - Hold on, why it always important that they always happy? What about us? Man we need to change that mindset. - Listen, now you talking. - Well truth be told, the bible did say be careful how you treat our wives, lest our prayers be hindered. - Yup. The liquor most certainly started to kick in. Man every time this dude get to drinking, he start quoting scripture. - Hey, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold on. He aint lying though. The bible does say that. - Yup, this most definitely about to be a long night. - Hey mama. Hey baby, what you doing? Nothing just At Style-Taneous Styles looking for something to wear to the company Christmas party. - Oh that's right, that is coming up isn't it? Send me a picture of your outfit when you get it. I'm just going to wear something I already have. - Now make sure it's burgundy because you know that's the color we wearing this year. - Oh yeah, that's right. Did you start your Christmas shopping yet? - Not yet, but I will soon. I know you're probably already done. When you get finished, in June? - Child, you know I don't mess around. I don't have time to be in the store with all those crazy folks. Anyway, I was just calling back from earlier. Call me when you get done. - Oh mama. - Yeah baby? - Never mind. - What is it Kelly? - Nothing. It's just Stan. I'm getting really frustrated. I feel like he's not for me anymore. - Oh, here we go, singing that same old song. Did you do what I told you to do? - Yes, I demanded that he get it together, but he has not changed. - No. You have to tell him that he either has to get it together or he needs to leave. I mean, he sitting up in that house, you serving God and he's disrespecting you and God, and want to act like the devil himself. Aint nobody got time for that. - Right, and do, you know, the other day I kept calling him over and over again and he wouldn't answer his phone for nothing. And when I got home, he was sitting on the couch with his friends, playing a video game. He spent all his free time doing that, it's so frustrating. - That don't make any sense. You could have been stranded on the side of the road or anything. - That's what I'm saying. - Now did you put blessed oil over the house like I told you? - No mama, I haven't done that. - Child, that's what you need to do. Put it on his pillow, put it in his shoes, on his toothbrush if you have to. I mean do what you need to do. Pray those demons right on up out your house. - Wait a minute, on his toothbrush mom? Look, I know you serious but that is hilarious. I really appreciate you talking to me ma, I do. But look, I'm going to go ahead and try to find what I need to get and get on up outta here. I'll call you later, okay? All right, baby. - I love you. - I love you too, baby. What? - This dude is a beast man. It is no stopping him. Hey what's up babe, you good? - I'm fine. - That you most definitely are. You look real good in that dress girl, fine, fine. Like a whole snack, come on over and sit down. - Stan I am not in the mood, okay? - Yeah, of course you're not. You're never in the mood. I wasn't doing nothing but giving you a compliment anyway? - A compliment? I could care less about a compliment from you. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I don't need your reassurance. - Is that what you learned at church today Kelly? - I'm not about to put up with your sarcasm today. I'm not gonna do it. - Look, you the one that came in here with his little attitude and being that you just came from church, I'm just trying to see. Is that what you learned today? - What ever Stan, I have every right to have an attitude. When are you going to get it? - Get what Kelly. - That I've changed. - Oh, have you? - Yes, but you won't acknowledge it, look, I'm ready for you to come on. - Come on and do what, what? - Quit dragging your feet. Get your life together and live for God. - Is that what I was doing when we first got married Kelly. - No and neither was I, and what does that have to do with anything? Look, I'm ready for you to come on. You're supposed to be the head and I'm supposed to be following you. I'm to follow you as you follow Christ, but you're not even following him. You make it so hard for me. - Look, let's just calm down because I've been in this house all day, waiting for you to come home from church so I can enjoy the rest of the day with my wife. But instead you want to come here with this whole little attitude. - You know how your day could have been enjoyed? If you would've came to church with me, Stan. - You know what? I'm just going to go get me something to eat. - Leave Stan, that's what you do best. Blessed oil. Father in the name of Jesus. God, I come to you right now praying against all these spirits in my house. Lord, especially for my husband. He is allowing the enemy to use him. I need you to help him to understand. Oh my God, Mrs. Anderson, what, how did you get, what, is there something you need? - It sounds as if there's something you need, honey. So I'm here to check on you. - Look, I'm fine, I'm just praying and about to put blessed oil over this house and pray these demons up out of my husband. - Whatever are you going to do that for dear? - Look, I need to see a change in Stan. - And you think you're going to see change by putting blessed oil everywhere? - I don't know, but I'm willing to give it a shot because things have gotten too far out of control. - Sweetheart, please just hear me out, that's all I ask. - Sure, go ahead. - All right, now listen. When I say this, it is coming from a place of love, all right? Okay, listen. The first thing you need to do, honey is to pray. - Mrs. Anderson, I was praying. - Yes, I heard you, sweetheart. It sounded like the prayer of the self righteous, which availeth not much, honey. Listen, you must first pray and ask God to change you. - Change me? - Yes. - Trust me, Mrs. Anderson, I have definitely changed. - Sweetheart listen, you are the one who proclaims to be the believer in this marriage, right? - Yeah. - So that means that you've given God permission to use you. - Well, I do let him use me. I serve and worship him faithfully. - Do you really Kelly? Listen, the Bible tells us in Romans 12:1 that we are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice dedicated to his service and pleasing unto him. - Now Mrs. Anderson. - Now that there is the true worship that you ought to be offering up. - Okay, so you really don't have to throw all this word at me because I know it very well. Trust me. - Child you do know your word, but it's not enough just to know it, now is it? The Bible tells us to be doers of the word and not hearers only. Deceiving your own selves. - But it's so hard and I'm getting tired of Stan. It takes two to make a marriage work. - Well sweetheart I'm not a firm believer in all them little popular sayings y'all have today. I don't know if it takes two to make a thing go right. Will it make things easier, maybe. But let me tell you what I do believe sweetheart. I believe that if there's at least one willing vessel that will allow God to have his way. Well then you at least have a chance of seeing things turned around for your good. - Well you are speaking the truth. You sure do have a lot of wisdom when it comes to marriage, how long have you been married? - I think its been, it seems like it's been about 2,000 years. Honey, that man was crazier than a road lizard. I want to tell you, we had our share of ups and downs. And you know what, I'd be willing to be your accountability partner if you will allow me to. - I'm willing to do. - All right, good. Now your first point of focus is to pray and ask God to change you, okay? And oh, may I make one more suggestion honey? - What's that. - You know you can't always take everybody's advice, all right. Even those who are closest to you. - Yes ma'am. - Happy holidays sweetheart. ♪ Together we walk side by side ♪ ♪ That's how it was meant to be yeah ♪ ♪ You see nothing else matters, no ♪ ♪ Our love is for eternity ♪ ♪ And you are my shining star, yes ♪ ♪ Our love will never depart ♪ ♪ Holding your hand with my hand in yours ♪ ♪ It is such a wonderful feeling ♪ ♪ This Christmas holiday we share ♪ ♪ I believe in you and me ♪ ♪ I believe in you and me ♪ ♪ And our love will always be ♪ ♪ I believe ♪ ♪ I believe ♪ ♪ Dance with me baby, step with me sugar ♪ - And so that will be your total need.

Let's start with that. - Hey Stan, many hands make light work, ya know? - Well we got many hands, let's make light work. And you're out of uniform. - I'm on light duty. - Hey, its Stan. - Hey baby. - Hi, what's going on with you baby, what's up? - Nothing, I tried to call you a few times earlier today. - Yeah, its been a little crazy around here, its been a little busy. - Oh. - Why, what's going on though, what's up? - Look I know you're busy so I will make it quick okay, umm You know that lady I be listening to on the radio all the time, Minister Norton? - Nah, not really, why what's up with her? - Anyway, so the girls are going to Chicago because she's going to be speaking at a women's conference in a couple of weeks and they wanted me to go. So just wanted to clear it with you first. How long is that for Kelly? - We leaving on Wednesday and coming back Sunday. - Hey, look, I don't know about that babe. - What do you mean you're not feeling it? - I mean what I said Kelly. Like that's five whole days you're talking about being gone. Look babe, I'm a little busy right now. Can we please just talk about this later when I get home? - Hold on, I was just calling you to be respectful. I really don't have to ask you for anything and furthermore, you know what you sure right, yes, we can talk about it later. - All right babe, I love you. - Love you too. - All right. - You're still going right? - Renee what are you doing ear hustling in on my conversation? - Sorry girl, anyway, I needed favor. - What is it, Renee? - Well, you know that guy I was telling you about right? - Which one, and why do you keep playing Rick? He seems like a really nice guy and I think he like you for real, for real. - Who likes nice guys plus those the ones you gotta watch out for. - My God. - Anyway, I'm talking about the one from Michigan. Girl. You know what I told you. - Girl, what is it? - Well he asked me to go out on a date with him, for his company party, so I'm just gonna need maybe two, three days off tops. - Okay Renee seriously, going forward you're gonna have to submit your time off requests to human resources. - Why Kelly, you the head of human resource. - I know Renee, look I'm working on a new me and they have guidelines that need to be followed. So we as in you, are gonna have to follow them. - Wait a minute Kelly, I don't know what's gotten into you, this has never been a problem before. - I know, and listen, please don't take it personal because I promise you its not like that. Look, I'm just trying to change okay, and I gotta do things different. - Change? I don't think I like all this change Kelly, I don't know what's wrong with you lately, but friend to friend, I'm not liking it. I'm not liking it Kelly, what's getting into you? - And we are back, right here are Mix 99.5, the heart and soul of St. Louis, this is your host Dee Marie right here with Be The Voice Live and we are at the question and answer part of our program and it looks like we have quite a few callers today. So we're gonna get right to it, caller number one, are you there? My name is Claire and I have a question for Minister Norton. - Praise God Claire, what's your question today? My question is, my husband and I, we are, we were high school sweethearts however when we got married I wasn't saved. - Okay. My husband still likes to party, he doesn't want to come to church with me, I just really feel that we're unequally yoked. And I just want to know if you have any type of advice that you could offer. - Fist I wanna say congratulations on accepting Jesus as your savior, that is absolutely the best decision that you could have made. Second, I want to congratulate you on accepting your God given assignment in your marriage, yes you are on assignment in your marriage to be a light and be obedient to Gods word. Also you know part of your assignment is to pray for your husband and his deliverance and then you also have an assignment to be the light to your husband. To be patient, to pray for him and his deliverance, and then to take all of your frustrations to God because truly he is the only one that can change your husbands heart, not you. Also I wanna recommend that you read 1st Peter, Ch 3 and just meditate on that, okay? Thank you so much Minister Norton. - Oh absolutely, its my pleasure. I also wanna recommend another book, its an excellent book, its called Are You Really His Good Thing by Kyria Williams and Chrissie Appleby. In that book is an entire section that is dedicated to those sorts of situations and Claire I thank you again for calling in and I hope that helps. Thank you so much. - Oh wonderful, God bless you. Thank you. - Minister Norton, that was awesome. - Praise God, praise God. - So it looks like we still have some callers. - Okay, okay, wonderful. - That you can take so, caller number two, are you there? - Who is it? It's Ebony. - Give me a sec Ebony. Kelly, open the door. - Oh my God. Hey Ebony. - Dang Kelly, what took you so long? - Girl I am so sorry, but I've been very busy. - Busy getting lit, girl and you didn't call me? What kind of friend are you? - Ebony girl, look, Stan and his friends just left, they were here celebrating a promotion he just got. - Please, Stan and his friends? They would be here getting this mess up too. - Don't start with me, I'm not in the mood, okay? - Kelly when are you gonna wake up? When are you gonna quit letting this man just walk all over you? - And what make you think he's walking all over me Ebony? - First of all you been saved going on four years now. This man aint thinking about getting himself together. He's still drinking Kelly. Girl he smoke. I just ran into him in the club last week. Don't you think you deserve a man that's gonna live for God the way you are? - Yes, I deserve a man that's living for God, but unfortunately I'm not married to one right now. And anyway who's knows what his future holds. - Girl, nothing. - Listen you right Ebony I've been saved for about four years now, but you know what I've been doing the whole time? - Girl what? - I've been lipping God to my husband, not living for God. - You've been doing what? - Okay, so look the bible says that we as wives are to draw our unsaved husbands by the way we live, not by our words, but by our actions. - Girl you serious about this Jesus stuff. My girl is changing for real. - I am. I really am, I even have an accountability partner that helps me out so much. - Well pray for your girl babe because I ain't no where near that point. - Trust me, I will. But look, I appreciate you coming over and seeing about little old me, but girl you see I got all this work to do. - Girl look I was just coming by to check on you boo. Make sure Stan aint have you locked in no cage or nothing. But if you need anything call me okay? - Okay, I will. - Oh, Kelly. Julie invited me to some conference thing, are you going? - Stan doesn't want me to go. - Stan don't want you to go, wait a minute, so now think you his daughter and not his wife? - No Ebony, he doesn't think that. Look all you need to know, just understand, that I'm trying to draw my husband by what I do. Not by what I say. - You know what Kelly, let me tell you something baby. You already know me honey, I'll never understand nothing like that. I'm gone, call me. - Oh my God, I can't believe she's still mad at me. I need y'all to help me with this apology. Okay, okay, I can go in there, I can go in there and I can just be like, please, please, Kelly, please. - Nah, that's too much begging. - You right, you right. I'm not a beggar. I know I can just write an old school letter, say I'm sorry and slip it under her door. - No, no, no, no, much too cowardly. Make it natural. - You right, cause I'm not a coward. I know, take her her favorite cup of coffee and just apologize. Old school, I'm sorry best friend, period. Yes, sounds good to me. - On my way. Kelly. Hey friend. - Renee, what's going on? - I just wanted to apologize. You know, for the other day, the way I ran up out of your office the other day. I don't want to seem unappreciative because I really do thank you for this opportunity that you're giving me. It's just this new you, it's going to take some getting used to. Now I'm not going to say I like it, but I do respect it. - Oh Renee, that's sweet, thank you. Apology accepted. - Awwee, so friends for life? - Of course, you know you're my girl. - All right. - Girl, let me go and get back to work. - Please. - Now don't say it like that Kelly. Like I'm not the only one around her doing all the work. I do everything, you don't want me to take no lunch, can't eat my chicken, huhh Oh, I forgot to tell you Mrs. Erickson's out here to see you, want me to send her in? - Yes please. - Okay. Hello. Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Good, and you? - Nice to see you again. - Same here. Thank you so much for fitting me into your schedule. I know you're busy, but I'm wanting to definitely drop these brochures off as promised. - Thank you. I will get these to Renee and make sure she puts them in their mailboxes before this evening. - Perfect. Is this you and hubby? - Yes, that is my baby. - You guys look so happy. How long have you been married? - Seven years. - Wow. - I remember Scott and I were happy. My, my, my. How things change. - Mrs. Erickson, are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm sorry, and please just call me Susan. We're just going through a divorce right now and things are really hard because we're still living in the same home. - I'm so sorry to hear that. How long have you all been married? - Four years and a day. - Wait a minute, your anniversary was yesterday? - I shouldn't be bothering you with my personal issues, I apologize. - Susan, you are fine. Listen, I believe nothing happens by coincidence. - Why do you say that? Well, my girlfriends and I, we started a wives' book club recently and I would love to invite you to the next one. - I couldn't. - Susan, listen, marriage is hard work. That's why we started this book club. So that we can hold one another accountable and encourage each other and from the sound of it, you don't want your marriage to end. Why don't you think about it? - I think it's a little too late for that. - Trust me. I think, I think it will help. Have you heard of Minister Norton? Tracy Norton? - Her name sounds familiar. - Okay, so she has a podcast, I listen to it all the time and recently she recommended this book. Are You Really His Good Thing by Kyria Williams and Chrissie Appleby. I recommend you pick it up and bring it with you when you come to the book club. - I'll think about it, I'll consider. - Okay, well I'll text you the address and I really, really hope you can make it. I think it will help you. - Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. - I know we just met, but I'm here for you. I can understand how it could be, you know, and I'll keep you in my prayers. - Thank you so much. - No problem. You have a good day. - Have a good one. You to. - Thank you. - Hey, what's up with the Mrs. Business woman? - Hi baby. - What I gotta do, pull a number or something just to speak to you? You poppin' now - Stop acting silly, what are you doing here? - Well since I was in the area, I decided to stop by and ask you on a date tonight. - Stan, you know it's Friday, I have church tonight and we're handing out turkeys. - See what I mean Kelly? What? - Its like I got to pull a number just to spend some time with my wife. - Stan don't be like that. Listen, I've been going to Friday night service for years, you know I don't like to miss it. - I'm sorry that I even came down to ask you. - Really Stan? Don't nothing and nobody come before my God. - Minister Norton you are preaching here today. You said something that was so profound, you said that as wives our first ministry is at home. Can you please talk to our listeners more about that? - Absolutely, I would love to. You know, we as women must realize the season that we're in, in our lives. If you are a married woman, there's a season for you. If you're unmarried, there's a season for you. In the Bible in 1st Corinthians 7:34, it talks about the difference between a wife and a Virgin. And it says that the unmarried woman cares about the things of God and how she may be Holy, both in body and in spirit. But that the married woman, she cares about the things for her husband and how she may please him. And I want to say something to all of your listeners out there today. I do not care what your title is in the church. I'm not concerned about that. What I am concerned about is that you are running to the church every time the doors swing open and you're volunteering for every opportunity that comes by you. All the while you are neglecting your family and your husband. But your first ministry, your first ministry is at home, sweetheart. - Oh my God. I'm neglecting Stan. I'm glad you're still here. Look, I'm sorry, I change my mind. I would love to go on a date with you tonight. - I'm good Kelly. You can go ahead and pass out your little turkeys or whatever I don't want to inconvenience you or nothing. You got your little church thing going on, so go ahead and do that, its cool. - Baby I promise you it's fine, okay? - Yeah alright. - I love you. - Yup. - Mm mm mm. Again, Holy spirit have your way. - Yes, have your way. - Renee, get back to work. - I'm om lunch. - Hey ladies, so we have a visitor. - Everybody, this is my girl, Susan, Susan, this Tasha, Candice, and Ebony, and you already know Julie. - Hi. - Hey Susan. Nice to meet you ladies. - Hey. - Thanks so much for allowing me to join you all. I've actually never been to anything like this, so I don't really know what to expect. - Girl, let me warn, you can expect a whole lot a bougieness. - Cut it out Ebony. Susan please don't pay her any attention. But its okay, we're just glad that you could make it. Actually we're just about to get started, so feel free to listen in or if you wanna jump in at any moment feel free to do so. - Thank you. - Yeah. All right ladies, so go ahead and make yourself comfortable. All right ladies so we are on chapter two, romance and riches. Yes honey. - Okay, so Susan, what we do is we read a chapter of the book each week. At the end of each chapter, there are little things that you can do to enhance your marriage, you know. We come back together, sitting like so, and each lady gets a chance to talk about what she got out of that chapter. - Okay, great. I'm just listening. - Oh, that's fine. All right, so we'll go ahead and begin with you Tasha. What'd you get out of this chapter? - Okay well, this chapter actually helped me a lot. In this section she focused on making her obligation as a wife, our first priority, over everything we have going on and you all know I have a lot going on. Whatever. There was one thing that really stood out to me in this section and I highlighted it. The enemy will play on your emotions. And have you thinking that withholding sex from your husband will teach him a lesson, but she pointed out that in the bible, it states that by withholding sex, we're actually placing them in a tempting state. - Whoa, wait a minute. What about the wives that don't withhold from their husbands and he still ain't no good? And out here giving his baby mama money that we aint even got? - Ebony. Come on, that's not the focus right now, okay? We'll deal with that in another subject girl. - Positive vibes only Ebony. - Girl didn't I tell you, a whole lot of bougieness. - Anyways, Tasha that was really good, and you know what? That was certainly a word for me. Ebony. What'd you get out of this week's chapter? - Skip me, I wasn't feeling it this week. - Ebony. - Girl look, I be doing all this stuff and he act like he still don't see me changing. And you already know, I'm not about to be nobody's fool. - Ebony, look we all agreed that we were gonna take this seriously. This is not a journey that you can take lightly. Look, we ought to be this way as wives whether they notice it or not. I mean because, we're not doing this unto them, we're doing it unto God. - You know what? We already said it before, let's say it on the count of three again. One, two, three. We're doing this unto God. - Yes, okay ladies let's get back to our book discussion. - Thank you Candice. - So in section three she talks about being good managers of our homes and a good example she wrote about was the husband being the thermometer and the wives being the thermostat. Now the thermometer, it just reacts to what's happening around it right, but that thermostat, that thermostat it monitors the environment. And if it gets to hot or to cold it decides what to do to correct the situation. Girl now that's good. - No it really is good, though because when he comes home with an attitude I instantly get one too. Look, I don't care what you've been through today, don't walk up in my house with an attitude. - Now that's what I'm talking about boo. No. - I'm saying that's how I used to react to it. But now I see that I am the thermostat and I can just adjust the temperature in the environment baby. - Can I just cut in here ladies and say something? - Sure, go ahead. - First of all, what you all are doing here is amazing. I mean, I really wish that I had met you guys before Scott and I got on this page in our marriage. - Sweetheart, look, if you want your marriage to work, it can, nothing is too hard for God. - And I know, but you know, Scott and I are going through a divorce right now. And honestly, I'm just listening for when God gives me an instruction and blesses me with my next husband. - Your next husband? - Baby, cause he would give you another one honey. - Stop it girl. - Susan you married to Scott right now. That should be your focus. Why is it that we could trust God, you know, for jobs, you know, we can trust him to watch over and save our kids, heal our bodies, but when it comes to relationships, most importantly, our marriage, we don't believe that he could fix it. Girl, God can fix anything. That's right. - All he needs is a willing vessel, a yielded vessel in your house in order for him to work. Trust me, I know. That's good. - I honestly do want our marriage to work. I just don't think it can in this state. - Oh my God. - Honey have y'all tried counseling? - Listen, this church, the pastor and his wife, they hold these marriage sessions every month called Marriage Works If You Work It. I really think you should go. - And the pastor also has a book out now called The Marriage Cup and The Covenant, Kelly did you read it? - I did, I've been trying to get Stan to read it with me, but you know how that is. - Do they do counseling at all? - You know what I believe they do, but I'll find out for you. - Please do. - Okay. It's going to be all right girl. Welcome home Mr. Stevenson. - Hey now, that's sexy right there. - You talking about the food or me baby? - Most definitely not the food. - Bonappetit. - Now look, Kelly, I could get used to this right here. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Well good because I just wanted a nice romantic dinner with my husband tonight. - I'm a tell you what, let me get out of these sweaty gym clothes, and I'm a be back to join. - Okay, you better hurry up. - I'm coming, believe that, I don't know what got into her but what ever it is I'm most definitely about to take advantage of it, I know that much. - Baby what are you doing? You're supposed to be in the shower. - Well you know I was planning on getting into the shower until I seen that all our money is going down the drain. Kelly what is this? - Baby, they're small tithes and offering statements, put that down okay. I'm in here waiting on you. - Are you telling me that you are giving this church this much money? - Stan, I pay my Tithes, and I give a little more tithes and offering, why are you tripping? - Why am I tripping? Kelly this statement say that you been giving that church over $10,000 within a year. What is wrong with you? You lost your mind or something? - Baby you really need to calm down for real. Look, I got dinner ready, come on boo. - Like some thing is certainly wrong with you, like them people got you brain washed. Do you know that you living in an apartment but I you that little preacher, he got a nice little lavish home with nice cars and taking care of his family. But you giving him all our money. - I'm not about to go back and forth with you about no tithes and offerings. You don't even go to church. Stan I went and dressed sexy for you, I went and got sushi for god sakes, trying to set up this whole romantic evening and you wanna sit up and argue about some tithes and offerings, you are unbelievable. I can't believe you. - Now see typical Kelly, you always try to make it like I'm tripping or something, well you aint gonna get it off this time cause at the end of the day Kelly, you were wrong. You act a complete fool when I go out to spend some money, its always we're on a budget, we can't spend too much money here. I see why now Kelly, cause you spending it at that church. - Baby you are not about to make me feel guilty about my obedience to God, okay. You kill me Stan when you want prayer or you want God's favor to help get your out of some trouble, then it all good, but the moment God requires something from you like money, now its a problem. And he the one that blessed you with it in the first place. - Wow. So instead of you understanding where I'm coming from you're really going to sit over there and defend this foolishness? Kelly, I don't get you like, I don't. - I don't want to do this tonight okay. We were having such a nice evening. Can we please just finish what we started? We have a long day tomorrow and I just want to enjoy this night and not let this ruin it. - Well, it's too late for that. It's certainly been ruined. - Stan are you serious? - As a heart attack. I'll be on the couch. - Look at this. Girl look, come on now. - Lord have mercy. Smell like your mamas, and grandmas, and auntie, and all them been in here cooking with y'all. - Hey, hey you funny man, but hurry up with that sweet potato though. - At your service. - Thank you. - Hey everyone. - Hey Tasha. - What's up, what's up big man. - What's up man. - Everything looks so good, and smells so nice. Thank you girl, you knew we try honey. - Yo, yo, yo, what up with it family. - What's going on people. - Hey yo, hey J dude. - Yes sir? - So I hear that the turkey that you got is supposed have me biting my fingers off. Well I'm here to be the judge of that. - Yeah cause you know me big J. I'm ready, I got a big old healthy appetite. - Five to ten minutes and guess what? - What's up? - Y'all are gonna be, tasting greatness. You feel what I'm saying? Hey but, he Stan, is Scott coming or what? - Nah man, no Scott man, you know what I'm saying. Him and his wife, they're going through it right now, he thought it was gonna be a lil fellas night, but when I told him it was a couples thing, he was Like ah, he'll pass. - Ladies, come help me set the table. - We don't want you doing anything, we got it girl. - Right. - Let's go. - Now James, look. I aint gonna lie, I still got my fingers but that turkey was good though. - Thank you. - Everything was absolutely amazing. True that, true that. - But it is my favorite part of the evening. We're about to play a new game and its inspired by the newly wed game. Just a little bit different, right babe? - That's right, check this out, so real simple game. Each couple gets a note card, okay. Now women, you're going to have the note cards first. We got men and women on opposite sides of the table. Just to make things a little more interesting. All right. - All right, we're going to ask 10 questions. After those 10 questions, ladies, you're going to write down what you think your husband would answer. Okay. - Men, you give the answer and ladies we'll see how well you know your man. - We got it babes, we got it. - We got this. - Simple enough, right? - Absolutely. - Well let's get started. - All right, y'all ready? - Question number one.

Well it mean rushed, swift, hurried, you know? - Okay boy, you better know those synonyms. Thank you. - Don't encourage him. - All right so, you Henry. - Cranky. - Crabby, extremely. - Maybe you need to adjust the temperature in the environment. - Wait a minute, now listen.

Pay tithes. - Henry you don't even go to church, where would you pay tithes to? - Baby I can send my money through Kelly, or Julie, or James. I mean they go to church. - The bible says you have to bring your tithes, not send them Henry. I was gonna try to send mine to. - Wow. - Trust me, listen to Kelly cause she know all about that, don't you? - That's what we doing Stan? Really? - Let's keep the positive vibes going. But Stan you're next, what would you do? - You know what I'd start up a church so I can get rich off all these people paying their tithes. - Right, now that's a good idea bro bro. - Antwan shut up. - You shut up. - Okay Kelly, what did you write down? - Certainly not that, so again, no points for us. - Hey Donte, what you got man? - Simple.

Yeah, that's good. - Kelly, we'll start with you. - Well, I think we all know that I am much better at managing the finances. - Really Kelly? Are you? You know, I did believe that to be true until I realized how much money you was taking out of our household. - Oh my goodness. - Really Stan, are you serious? You know what? I'm sorry y'all. We about to go. No Kelly. - It's okay, it's just a lot of negative energy coming from over here and I do not to ruin the vibe. Come on Stan I'm ready to go. - Hold up, so now you're just gonna leave me here? - No I'm not leaving here Stan, you coming to, come on I'm ready to go, please. - Hey Stan. - Alright yall. Y'all have a good night. Alright. Bye. - I cannot believe that you humiliated me in front of our friends like that, what is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? I can't believe that you've been humiliating me behind my back. - How am I humiliating you Stan? - What you mean Kelly? - You know what, you are unbelievable. I just came home the other day and you and your boys was in the house smoking and drinking. - And your point Kelly? - That's my house Stan. - Yours? - Yes, you know what you do what ever you want to do when you want to do it, I'm tired of the disrespect Stan. - Hold on who you think you talking to? Oh so you my mama now? - Nah, nah, nah, Stan aint ruin the vibe, that was Ebony over here with all that woody woody woo. Getting all negative and now its just spread like wild fire. Look. - So its negative cause I'm speaking the truth huh? - Yes. - Don't get mad at me cause you a fool for your baby mama and you the only one who don't know it. - Stop it please. You guys are disrespecting each other and its not cool. - You know what Julie you right. We shouldn't bring this vibe into your home, it is Friendsgiving. Kelly aint the only one leaving, I'm gone too, I'm outta here. I can't stand her - that's that 5050 I was telling y'all about. Right there. Antwan, let's go. - Antwan. I'm sorry. - Well we can stay and finish the game if you guys want. - Stan, I have every right to have a say so in what goes on in this house, look I've been holding so much in for so long, I'm not doing it anymore, I'm tired. - But when we were smoking and drinking together it wasn't a problem. - You doggone right its a problem. Look that was our life style before Stan but I'm not living like that anymore, why can't you get that through your head? - You do understand this is my house just as much as yours, right? So you can't be telling me what I can and cannot up in here Kelly. And you most definitely aren't going to be taking no money out of here neither. - Look, I said, what I said. - And I'm saying what I'm saying. Look, I've been dealing with you, with your whole change and I don't say nothing to you about it, but then you want to pull this up on me? Like what more is it that you want from me Kelly? - What more I want, I want you to listen to me Stan. - Man look. - See look at you, that's what I'm talking about Stan. I'm trying so hard. To be a good wife to you. When you told me I couldn't go out of town, I didn't go out of respect for you as my husband. But you, baby it's so unfair because you do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and I'm tired of it Stan. I'm sick of your mess, I deserve so much better. - You're tired of and you sick of my mess? - Yes. - And you deserve better? - Yes I do. - You know what Kelly, you right and I've been doing some serious thinking. You just not the same woman that I married seven years ago. You all into this whole new religious stuff and you always trying to force it on me and I'm just not with it. - Okay, look babe you right, I'm sorry okay. Look, we ain't getting nowhere. It's like we talking at each other and not to each other baby. Look yes, I decided to serve God and prayerfully you will to one day, but that has to be your decision. - Exactly Kelly my decision and that's just not it right now. Look I can't do this no more. - You can't do what anymore, Stan what you talking about? - Us Kelly, this marriage, its just not gonna work. - Wait, wait, hold up. You don't know if you want our marriage to work, are you serious? - Look like I said Kelly, we on two different pages. You just said that you deserve better and you do, cause the truth of the matter is our marriage is not what it once was. We're unequally yoked. Aint that what your bible said? - Hold up babe, Stan, Stan hold up, Stan. Baby look I am so sorry, look I want out marriage okay. No Stan when I said I want better, I want better with you babe. - Kelly don't do this. I want a divorce. - What? Wait hold on, Stan. - Sweetheart. Now tell me what happened. - I can't, I can't do it anymore. I give up. I've been giving my all, I've been praying, I've been fasting, I've been submitting, I've been doing everything that the bible tells me to do as a wife but its like he's forgotten about me. - Who do you feel has forgotten you sweetie? - God, Mrs. Anderson, he is punishing me for something, I just don't know what it is. - Oh Kelly listen to me. Okay, anytime storms in life come your way, don't always assume that you're being punished. As long as you're walking up right before God, it's either one of two things. He's either testing you or baby he is showing you off. - I know what it is, I've been too nice to him. Letting him walk all over me. I should have been mean and cruel like any other wife would have been. - Not a wise wife Kelly. Honey listen, you are doing the right thing right now, I know it don't feel like it but you are, you are being obedient to the word of God. Well look what my obedience has gotten me. Headed to divorce court - Divorce court? Who told you to go to divorce court? That is the first thing that comes to mind among marriages these days. We don't even get to experience the fullness of God and all his promises because we just give up too easily. Why don't you turn in this bible to 1st Peter, Ch 3. - Mrs. Anderson, right now is not the time. - Right now is the perfect time, honey. Come on, turn to 1st Peter, Ch 3. And I want you to read verses one and two. Come on, come on. - Wives in the same way, submit yourselves to your own husbands. So if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. - That's right, see there? Now you are doing exactly that honey. What the word of God instructs you to do. So whatever happens out of all this baby, it is supposed to happen. Look you're right when you say you can't handle this, that its too much for you to bare. Because this is not your battle. Honey this battle belongs to the lord. - But what about Stan? You know like, I have you. Here you're talking to me and you helping me but who, who's gonna help him? Who's gonna. Who's gonna be there for him? - Well that's your next prayer. Okay? You need to start to pray and ask God to send him someone into his life who can speak godly wisdom to him. Okay? - Yeah. - And you know what? I want you to take this journal and I want you to write your thoughts in this journal every single day. And anytime God answers a prayer, write that in here too. - Thank you. - Well sweetheart, we all could use a little guardian angel sometimes. - Scott. You've been quiet the whole ride here, what's wrong? - One minute you're talking about a divorce. Now you got us in a counseling session with a pastor. I don't even know him, you don't either. - You remember I told you I was going to the book clubs, right? - Said something about it. - Well they've actually been helping. And I just, looks lets just, we'll talk about it later. - Hello, Scott and Susan. Very nice to meet you both. - Nice to meet you too pastor. So the reason that I arranged this session is because my husband and I, Scott we're currently going through a divorce. Okay. - However, we're still living in the same home. - Okay, all right. So share with me some of the details and background information. - Sure. So Scott and I have been married for four years. I was a customer service representative at a rental car company and he was a frequent customer. He asked me out one day, but I wasn't interested. - You wasn't interested? - No, initially I wasn't interested Scott, you know that. - Yeah, yeah okay. - However, he was very persistent. So I finally gave in and we went to dinner. He was such a gentleman. He wowed me with his conversation and things were really great. I mean, we started spending more and more time together and we clicked, almost a perfect relationship. Until things changed. After he cheated. - You would just skip to some cheating stuff, wouldn't you? - But that is what happened. - No things changed way before I cheated. You act like you can't just get past it. Like I said, I did it. She forgave me, now she's still just going on with it. Like I said, man, things changed way before I cheated. - What changed Scott? - Everything. We had way more sex before we got married than we do now. - And I wasn't saved then either. - What does that have to do with anything? - Everything. - Saved women can't have sex? - Whatever. - When it's time for intimacy, she used to come to bed, looking all sexy and beautiful. Now she come to bed all wrapped up with this helmet looking thing on, looking like a linebacker. - A linebacker what? Seriously? You're not looking to hot yourself. - She only look like this when she going out, she don't look like this all the time. Like when we at home, she don't look like this. This aint the same woman in the crib. You have no sex appeal at the crib, but you go out you looking all good. - I am so sorry, clearly we can never resolve anything because it always ends up in argument. We obviously need some help. - Yeah, she needs some help. - God. - Scott, Susan, what I hear right now is nothing that I don't hear on an every session basis as I counsel lots of couples. Scott I'm a start with you. As the husband and in Gods order he's made you the leader of your marriage and for you the two things you need to focus on is protecting and providing for your wife. And unfortunately what happens in infidelity is that you broke trust. And once you break trust its difficult to get it back. Because trust is not given Scott, its actually earned. And trust is time tested and in order for it to be earned, you got to get to a point where you give her what she needs and not what you want her to have. And Susan as it relates to your faithfulness God puts a tremendous, big responsibility on the wife to care for her husbands needs as well. And so as it relates to you, listen to Scott. What I hear form Scott is not anything out of the ordinary that I hear from men all the time. What he wants is to enjoy his wife, and the way God has set things up, he can only enjoy that level of intimacy with you and with you alone. Scott and Susan are you both willing to put forth the effort that's needed in order for this marriage to work? - Yeah. - Yes. - Okay, well if you are, if you would mind joining hands. We'll touch and agree together and I go before the lord in prayer. Lord God, we thank you for our time today. We thank you for speaking specifically to my heart about what you wanted both Scott and Susan to hear God. - Hey. You finished with the microwave? - Yeah bru. Hey man, let me get that man. I don't even like my food that hot anyway. - Man, guess what Gary just made him do. - What? - He was at the microwave, Gary made him take his food out the microwave and it wasn't even done warming up. - Stop it bro. - You letting Gary take your lunch money. - Real funny man, aint nobody scared of no Gary. - What's wrong with you boy? Why he sitting all up with is tail tucked between his leg? You all right? - Hey look bruh, I left Kelly man. - What? - Say what? - What? - I just couldn't do it no more, so I left. - So y'all thinking about getting a divorce? - Listen, man, she said out her own mouth the other day that she deserved better and she fed up with me and I'm fed up with her. - Well I know what you shouldn't be doing is sitting here and beating up yourself about it. I mean, from everything you're saying, if she didn't change too much for you and you can't deal with it, then you need to do what you need to do, but our break almost over, you know, we only get 30 minutes. We outta here and I'll see you later. Mr. Stevenson, sir. - What's up Stan? - What's going on with you? - You mind if I sit here for a minute and rap with you? - Not at all. - I don't mean to get in your business man, but I couldn't help but to overhear your conversation with your guys right. And I have some advice for you. - All right, what's up what's that? - Your story, it reminds me so much of my own bro. But you see the only difference is it was me that gave my life to God and my wife stayed out of the world. - Hey man, that's crazy. Like that's the exact way that I feel, man. - Let me ask you something Stan. Have you ever asked your wife how she feels? - Be honest with you I haven't. Like there ain't no reason to cause I already know how she feel man. Look, check this out. When I say to my wife, like she has completely changed, like, I mean it. Me and my wife, we used to do everything together, go to the clubs, party, hang out, drink, smoke or whatever the case may be. But now she is totally different man and I mean that. - You know, I met my wife in the club, but I was deep in the dope gang, running the streets. But then I went to the penitentiary for seven years and that's when I gave my life to God. You know, man, my wife hung in there with me the whole time I was locked up. But you know she thought I was playing because that's what brothers do. When they go to jail, they find God. And when they get out, they leave God in there. - We all know them kind, now don't we? - That wasn't the case with me. I was serious. When I came home, I was a completely changed man. And when she saw this change in me bro, she thought I was trying to be a preacher, but I'm like, baby, no, I'm just trying to, you know, I'm just living for God, but she didn't want to hear it. She thought she be getting in the way of my calling. So she left. - That's crazy, man. Like that's the exact same way that I feel. Like don't get me wrong or nothing. I love the new woman that Kelly becoming. But then again, I just feel like she deserves better. And I can't give her that right now, man. - Stan what you mean, bro? You can't be that better for your wife? - Hey look Gary I aint gonna even lie to ya. I don't even know if I can or a how to be it. - Stan, listen man can't you see that's just the enemy's way of distracting you for what all God called you to be. See, look, when you give your life to God, he becomes your GPS system and all you got to do bro, is just be obedient to his voice. He got you. - Hey man, that's deep. Hey well tell me something, so how long have you and your wife, y'all been divorced now? - Stan, I can happily say me and my wife have been back together now four and a half years. Let me ask you a question. You ever heard of this lady named Minister Norton? - Have I heard of Minister Norton? Yes, man like that's all my wife listen to, all day, all night. - My wife is Minister Norton. - Straight up? That's great man, that's a small world man. - But listen, bro, let me tell you what we did. My pastor wrote this book. It's called The Marriage Cup and The Covenant. I got a copy of that book. I really would like for you to read it and prayerfully, it'll help you understand what God ordained married to be and not to be. Don't take for granted, your wife praying and her faithfulness to God. I'm gonna keep you and your situation in my prayers. - All right Gary man, I appreciate that, bro. - No problem. Ladies, I promise as soon as Ebony gets here, we will get started. - Yall, I'm so sorry. I couldn't find my keys no where. - Oh my God, girl. You lose those keys more than anybody I know. - Girl, we're gonna get you one of them clap things. - Girl no, what I need it that shirt, better late than ugly. I shouldn't even be here. - Let's get started. - I ain't all the only one y'all waiting on I see, where Kelly at? - Well, just between us. Kelly called me the other day and she asked me to pray with her and she also asked me not to say anything but I figured since we're all girls, we all could just pray together about her situation. What situation? - Don't say nothing y'all. Okay. - Stan left Kelly. What? - Are you serious? - Yes. - Girl wait a minute, you mean Kelly left Stan? - Stan left Kelly, and check this out, he said he didn't want to be with her anymore because he's not ready to change his life the same way that she had. - You know what, I don't feel sorry for her, that what she get. - Why would say such a thing? - Girl look, I told Kelly a long time ago that their relationship was not gonna work. She's so submissive. The bible says this, and the bible says that, girl that stuff is for women back in the bible days, that is not for women today. - Girl look, I stopped by the other day because she hadn't been answering the phone for me. Girl, Stan and his potnas had just left, girl they had stuff everywhere. - I remember a time when Stan was laid off from work. - Girl, Stan used to always be laid off. - I called Kelly just to ask her if she can loan me some money until Friday when I got paid. - Oh, James and Julie needed to borrow money? Hmm - Be quiet Ebony. Y'all know she told me to let her discuss it with Stan? - That's probably why she was so mad last week when she told Ebony she wasn't taking the book seriously. - Right, talking about some, Ebony, we all agreed not to take this journey lightly. - Stop. - You ladies ought to be ashamed of yourselves and you all are supposed to be her friends? And you, she told you something in confidence so that you can pray for her. Not broadcast her business to everybody. Kelly is going through a dark season in her life right now. And all you all can do is sit around and talk about her? You may say that the word is for the old days, but honestly I have never seen the righteous forsaken. And it's working in my life. If you all are her friends, she definitely don't need enemies. - Who is she? Girl anyway, she don't come around here and try to tell us how we discuss our friend. Kelly is our friend and she the new kid on the block. Anyway onto the next chapter of the book. Girl please. Oh, there's power in submission. I guess Kelly found out all about that power huh? - Ebony. I feel horrible. Susan's right. We should just pray for Kelly. Man, I know this is gotta be hurting her. - This is Kelly. - Put her on speaker. - No, sh. Hello? Oh honey. Okay sweetie, yeah. Yeah, okay, yup. I'm on my way. - What's going on? - What she say? What did she say. - Candice, first we need to know, Candice. - This is not you. Have you even left the house? - I can't eat, I can't sleep. I can't do nothing. Candice, why did it end up like this? Like this is not supposed to be the end result. Oh my God! - Are you sure? Yes. What are you guys doing here? - Kelly, we came over as soon as we heard what happened. How could he just walk out of your life like this as good as you've been to him? Where is he at? Matter of fact, where's his clothes at? - Sweetheart I am so sorry. Is there anything I can do? - No, there's nothing nobody can do. Look, I'm just going to continue to pray for him. - Okay, hold on. Enough is enough, you mean to tell me that you still want to pray for this man after he walked out of your life that easy Kelly? Girl you saved now, God has a better husband in store for you, someone that's saved and not still out here in these streets. - Maybe Stan is a stumbling blocking in your way and God just had to remove him. - You Know what Kelly, we have been through a lot of things together and I have just never seen you play this role before. Never. - The submitting, and that loyalty stuff, you know men now a days, they take that for granted. - I know you said that God told you your marriage would work, but clearly he isn't speaking of this one. Couldn't have been. - There is nothing in scripture that says to be this way only if your husband is saved. Yes, God did tell my marriage would work, thank you for reminding me of that Tasha. Look, if God said it I'm gonna believe him because it shall come to pass. You know what, I'm going through a real rough time right now and the last thing I need around me is non believers. Look. - No. - Please, y'all just let yourselves out. - You can be a fool all you want, don't call me. - Ebony get out of my house. - I'm so sorry. ♪ Oh I know if I leave ♪ ♪ I'll take a chance at being alone ♪ ♪And honestly I'm afraid cause I don't wanna live that way♪ ♪ See late at night when you hold me close ♪ ♪ Baby I feel so safe ♪ ♪ And its a cold cruel world out there ♪ ♪ And baby I'm leaning on faith ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to love baby ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to, get to love ♪ ♪ Can we get to ♪ - Y'all I just feel so bad for Kelly. - Girl so do I. Y'all know this is the first time that Stan's not here for her companies Christmas party? - She seems to be holding up pretty good though. - Girl you know how it is. She is in the presence of company, she got to put on her game face. - That's true. - Why are y'all over here looking all gloomy in the face? I mean come on, its Christmas eve, snap out of it already. - Ebony, we're just really feeling sad for Kelly right now. - Girl, feeling sorry for Kelly for what? - You know this is her favorite holiday and Stan's not even here with her. - Girl, well whatever, life goes on. And anyway from my understanding, wasn't she just praying and asking God for a new husband for Christmas? And girl with all these fine, successful men in here, girl, she might be getting her prayers answered. - Goodness Ebony just stop. - Oh Lord, here come Ms suchy much. - She looks so beautiful. - Must be her husband. - I just love when marriages work out. - Girl, I need another drink. - Hey Scott. - What's up. - Man this is my beautiful wife Susan. - Nice to meet you Susan. That's Donte, and that's my man James. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you all. Babe, I'm gonna go to the rest room, be right back. - All right, okay, all right. - Good God, please tell me she got a sister. A cousin, friend, anybody. - Gentlemen, gentlemen, have we purchased our raffle tickets yet? - No sweetie I haven't, my name is Steve. Steve. - How much are they? - Only one for 150, and five for 600. - No sweetie, one for 150, five for 600? No, I'm talking about the raffle tickets. - And so am I. - My wife already purchased our tickets, so thank you. - You must be James. - I am. - Julies husband. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You as well. - And thank you so much for that annual contribution. - Listen we're blessed to be a blessing. - Raffle tickets, we sell raffle tickets. - Oh my God, fellahs, hi. You don't know how happy I am to see y'all, thank you so much for coming again this year. - Of course, why wouldn't you think we wanna come? - Well you know, things have been kinda crazy and given the circumstances, I just wasn't sure. - Hey Kelly, you and Stan are our friends and we're going to support you all no matter what, okay? - Oh, Donte, Thank you, that is so sweet. Thank you, I appreciate that. - Hey Kelly. - Yeah? - Stan normally volunteer for the raffle auction every year, so who gonna do it this year? - I asked my daddy to it. - Man, your dad is old. - Henry don't clown my daddy, I know it won't be like last time, but trust me it'll be fine. - Excuse me, hi everyone. Would you excuse Mrs. Stevenson for just a second, we're gonna go ahead and get started with the raffles. - Okay, I'll catch up with you guys later, all right? - All right. - Later Kelly. - See you. - Call her daddy old? - I'm just saying. Just saying man. - If I can have everyone's attention please, we're gonna start our raffle drawing now. - Oh hey Susan. - Julie, how are you? - I am ready for my bundle of joy. - I see, how adorable. - Thank you. Susan, I really wanted to apologize for how we acted at our last book club meeting. We have all acknowledged that we were wrong, and we've even apologized to Kelly. - That's so good to hear because honestly the apology to Kelly is what's most important. I mean you guys have known her far longer than I have and I just, I was shocked to hear you guys speak of her in that manner. That's all. - Oh my God, we shouldn't have, and I promise we will never do so again. - We're good girl, because true, genuine friendship is so hard to find these days, and Julie you all really do have something special. - Thank you Susan. - Your welcome. - And I see that you and hubby has decided to work things out. - We have and let's just say, I'm a adjusting the temperature in my environment. - Well okay, girl that is what I'm talking about. - Yes. - Congratulations girl. - Thank you girl. - Kelly, what's wrong? - Sorry. It's just not the same without him being here. I miss him so much Susan. - I'm so sorry Kelly. You are such a strong woman. - You are but you don't have to be strong for us. - Susan's right. We all have our breaking point. But listen, we're are your girls. So it is okay not to be okay sometimes. - I mean, you know I've been praying and asking God to help me because I thought it was going to be different. I didn't know it was going to turn out like this. Oh Kelly. - Look at me, I'm alone. - No you're not. Listen, listen to me. I don't care how it looks. You keep trusting God and you believe that whatever your heart desires, if it is in God's will, he will give it to you. Kelly you were there for me in my darkest season. And I'm going to be here for you in yours. - Yes, we all are Kelly. - Girl, just to shed a little light, didn't you just pray and ask God for a new husband for Christmas? And girl with all these fine men in here. You better dry your face and come get your prayers answered. - Oh my God, Ebony. Girl you are crazy. I can always depend on you for a good laugh. I really appreciate y'all. I do, you're my girls and I don't know how I would have gotten through this without y'all. I love you all so much. We love you too. - Thank y'all so much. - Kelly, you need to get out here, you need to see this, come on y'all, let's go. - What in the world, Renee, hold on. What's going on? - All right and the last ticket number is 311. 307. That's me! - All right, all right, all right. That's it, that's it, that's it. You got it, you got it. All right, make sure you check with Mary to get your prize at the end of the night. And to the rest of y'all we appreciate y'all for coming out, thanks for the support because this event is very, very dear to my wife so we appreciate y'all, now party on, and, a Merry Christmas to y'all. - Girl see, I told you he was here. What you gonna do? - Can't believe he came. - What's up with it? - Catch up with yall in a minute. Merry Christmas Mrs. Stevenson. - Stan what are you doing here? - Hey, what am I not welcome this year? Well I did say I would be the raffle ticket announcer, right? So I'm just here to honor that. And plus besides, you know this party wouldn't be nothing without old Stan the man right? - Is that the only reason why you came. - Of course, what other reason would I be here? - Thanks for honoring your commitment. - Kelly, Kelly, sweetheart, sweetheart, I'm kidding. Seriously, I miss you. - I um, You do? - I do. And I have some things I'd like to say to you. - I'm listening. - Can we step outside. - Sure. - After you. - So why did you have to bring me out here to talk, it's freezing. - Look, I know babe, I just wanted to get you away from the noise. I just got a few things on my chest I wanted to get off, that's all. - I'm listening. - All right so Kelly. Never in a million years, would I have thought that my mindset would change the way they that it did like in the short span of time. You know the same week that I had left this guy, my job, he had sat down, spoke to me and he I gave him this book to read, he invited me to come out to his church. - Okay. - Now the name of the book is called The Marriage Cup and The Covenant. - Oh wait, hold on. You mean to tell me the book I've been trying to get you to read with me Stan? - I knew that book had sounded familiar. - Oh my God. It's too cold for you to be playing. - Hey well everything happens in God's timing right. - You right. - So anyway like I was saying, like the book is so powerful Kelly. You know, you read the book but what got me is the way they speak on the roles and responsibility of a husband and a wife. - Yeah. - And when I was reading the part about a wife, Kelly, like you was doing everything that you were supposed to do in our marriage, it was me. Like I wasn't leading the way I should have been leading you. So, but anyway, the crazy part about it is the author of the book is actually the pastor of the church the guy invited me to go out to. - Wow, did you go? - Yes, I had to go, like, cause I had to speak to him like, personally, like in that very moment, and I really understood my role more as a husband. So I even joined the church. - Wait a minute, you joined the church Stan? - Yes I joined the church. That's not even the crazy part about it. - What's the crazy part Stan? - I gave my life to Christ Kelly. - Wait a minute. You gave your life to Christ? - Yes. - Really? - I did. - Baby, that's so good. - To be honest, like the real reason I'm here Kelly is because on this past Sunday the message was about forgiveness. So I just simply came here and ask you for your forgiveness. - I forgive you. - And if you don't want to forgive me, I totally get that. - I forgive you. - You do? - I said I forgive you baby. Merry Christmas, Mr. Stevenson. - Merry Christmas Mrs. Stevenson. Thank you Jesus. Aw. - Oh my God. Merry Christmas. - Antwan, it reads, do understand that forgiveness and trust are two different things. Just because you might forgive, does not mean trust is going to automatically be restored. I really like this book. Learning your husband's style of communicating is beneficial. - That's what I'm talking about right there. Keep reading! Nah, nah, here, I'll read. It said learning your husband's style of communicating is beneficial. Okay, every man is not the same. However, one thing they all have in common is that they all want to be respected. Speaking to him as if he is a child will not be received very well. Amen to that. Many times we, y'all have a valid point and are right in what y'all are trying to communicate, conversely, meaning at the same time, the way y'all communicate at times is where the challenge is. This is one heck of an author. Where's your highlighter? - Mrs. Anderson? Hello? - Excuse me. Are you the lady that lives downstairs? - Yes, hi, I'm Kelly Stevenson. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm just looking for Mrs. Anderson. Her apartment is empty and she didn't tell me she was moving. - I'm sorry, who? - Mrs. Anderson, she lives here. - No, this apartment has been vacant now for over a year. - Excuse me? - No one has lived here in over a year. - Okay, so it couldn't have possibly been vacant because I've spent time with her here talking many times over this past year. - No, Mrs. Stevenson, right? - Yes. - Okay. Mrs. Stevenson, you may want to give the leasing office a call. I know it's the holidays, so you may have to wait a week, but give them the call, they may be able to help you out with the situation. - Okay, but I know I'm not crazy. Are you 100 % certain that no one has lived in this apartment in the past year? - I am 200 % certain dear. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. - Wow, God you are truly amazing.
