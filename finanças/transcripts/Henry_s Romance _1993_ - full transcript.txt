Green Henry Give me your hand, Beloved! Long live Lys, the king of Carnival! Long live Lys, the king of Alau! Long live Lys! Henry! Green Henry, come on! Green Henry, tonight you'll be the king of the fools. Stay with me and I'll show you life. Real life! Is everything prepared? - Are the sauces sufficiently spiced? - Have a taste, Madame. Madame, they are coming. Stay there! Hail to you, beautiful Rosaly! I bring with me violence, madness and voluptuous pleasure of the carnival. Hail to you! Welcome. Tonight I open my door to you and all the artists. A happy man I'd be if your door was open to me every night. And your lover? Behind which mask does he hide? My lover, I'd find him even if I was blind. I crave for you, you know? You are monstrous, I'm betrothed. I'm getting dizzy. Henry, Green Henry! Look after my fianc?e, I have work to do. Looks like you have a fool for company tonight. I'm the one who is the fool. Why do you stare at me? I'm sorry. You remind me of someone. Ericson! Come with me. May I? Someone you loved? Or someone you deceived like he's deceiving me? Agnes? Leave me alone. He doesn't mean to hurt you. Lys is overflowing with life. You can't change him. He was the first. I trusted him. I want to kill myself. I will kill myself. No! Don't say such things! I can't go on. I can't bear it. Agnes, please! I'll bring him back. The pig, the pig! Strike it hard, strike it hard! Lys, come quickly. Agnes talks of killing herself. What are you saying? She wants to die of love for me? Be serious, Henry. I am serious. You're making fun. Bastard! Agnes! My life has come to an end. He's taken the only thing I had... my honour. There is only death for me. You're wrong. For me you'll never die. Anna... Anna. Henry, what have you done to my fianc?e? Did you do it on purpose? To have me all to yourself? Well then... why this anger, my young fool? What's got into you? Can't you take a joke? You've killed her. Get up, Agnes. Stop this nonsense. You want her? You have her. Here, take her! You've destroyed her. First I killed her. Then I destroyed her. I crowned you king of fools, now you are one. She'll have forgotten by tomorrow. She wants to die. She's going to die. She's going to die, the stupid bitch. And you hate me for that? Yes, I hate you. Go ahead then. Kill me. Is it true that a fool has no balls? What do you know about anything? You're just a ghost among us. Your painting is empty, sterile. It is the opposite to life, which is beautiful, rich, fertile. Come on, show me that there's some life in you. A gesture, anything, even of hate. Go ahead! Anything! Kill me! No, not like that. A duel. A duel! A duel? Are you crazy? She's just a girl, there are thousands like her. A duel, I want a duel. We'll meet at dawn. Green Henry. Do you really want to know death? Death? I knew it before I knew life. Papa! I got you, little hunter. Not so fast. Attack! Let's go! Papa! I don't like this game! Uncle. No! You're killing him. Henry. Now you are the man of the house. You have to wear your father's suit. Go back to bed. You said I was the man of the house. So I have to sleep in Papa's bed. I won't repeat it. Henry, go back to bed. I'm frightened. Henry... you have to thank God, our Father. Pray with me. Our Father who art in heaven... Father is dead, God is dead. I want my father! Henry! No! Come along, your mother needs you. - No! - Henry! Come, come along, my boy. Henry, you have to say goodbye to your father. He'll be eaten by the worms. Come along, both of you. Stay here with your cousin, Anna. No Christian, it's my turn! Henry! I can't play. My fingers hurt. They're frozen. Well then, if you don't want to freeze to death you had better dance. Get down! A chair! Rise! Minuet. Minuet. How dare you... How dare you do such a thing! Come here immediately, Anna... and bring the flower. It was me! Idiot! I gave her the snowdrop. What have we here? A romantic? A hero? Hold your hand! To steal is a sin, Henry Lee. Repeat. You shall repent and ask God for forgiveness. On the cupboard, immediately! You will sorely regret that! Don't make a noise, or he'll catch you. I know. I've brought you something to eat. Today you saved my life, so now it's my turn to save yours. That means we'll stay together all our life. Yes... and we'll marry. And when we are married we have to kiss. Anna, have you ever kissed before? Neither have I. - What was it like for you? - It tasted of fish. I liked it. Shall we do it again? "And the man left his father and his mother to follow his wife, and the two became one." A rib, she's made of one of my ribs. You needn't feel guilty of reading the bible. I'm very pleased you do. That means you're becoming sensible. Anna. What can I say to you? Uncle says he is also concerned about Anna. Thank God your father isn't here to see this. What shall I do with you? Look at me. Look at me! Since your father has gone I am alone. Do you ask yourself where the shoes come from, the food on the table? Never... Can I scratch my nose? Yes, if you want to. That isn't me you're drawing. Yes, this is you, Anna. You're my rib. Your rib? Listen what the bible says: "And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and took one of his ribs of which he made a woman and brought her unto the man." Oh yes, I'm your rib. I spent all night in bed counting my ribs and I think I have them all. Let me see. One, two, three, four... don't move! You're tickling me. Five, six, seven... This one's short. But it's still a rib. You say you have an eye that can see? And you want me to teach you to paint. Why did you choose me? Because there's no one else here. Good. Anna? Don't you think you're a bit young for love? She has one of my ribs. One of your ribs... Women have had every part of me. And I've possessed every part of them. If you want to paint you have to know life. And in order to know life you have to know death. You cannot live in the light unless you have known the dark, young man. I have known the darkness... I have known life. Me too. You? What? As young as you are... Tell me what was the worst thing that happened to you. To see my mother die. Your mother is dead? No, it's my father who's dead. Draw, draw what you saw. Show me! Yes, that's it. Go on, show me! Yes. Good. The first step is taken. How many steps are there? As many as it takes. Henry, I have something to tell you. Let's go and see the devil. But I must talk to you. "My chest starts to burn. Let us go, come quickly. Who is hurting me? Damn creature. You leave the pot. You roast your mistress. Break, break! On the floor gruel, on the floor old glass, it is but fun, the measure, bitch, of your tune! Do you recognize me? Skeleton, scarecrow!" It's him, the devil. "Do you recognize your Lord and Master?" Get away, Anna! But that's Mr. Zimmermann, the landlord. Mr. Zimmermann, the landlord? No, it can't be. It's the devil. I want to see him. "Your hesitation delays the moment of death. I've killed my mother. And I've drowned my child. It's your child, Henry. It was sent away for us two. This is no dream. Give me your hand, Henry." What are you doing here? "It's wet. Dry yourself." Go, go away! "It's soaked in blood! God, what have you done?" What have we here? A couple of monkeys? Excuse us, sir. We wanted to see the devil. You wanted to see the devil. Come along, follow me. Henry, I have something to tell you, it's important, please. But I must go. What I have to say is very important. Please, Henry, please. I won't be long. I promise. You two will be two excellent little monkeys. Get undressed! The trousers, too? Yes, completely. Oh, God! This doesn't fit, I need a bigger one. We haven't got another one. Put on your clothes and go. "You try hard to escape my arms. Who robbed me of your heart?" Jump around a bit. - What's he got? - He thinks you're the devil. Not far wrong. Come here. Come! What's your name? Henry... Henry Lee, sir. Henry Lee. I want you to hop around for me, Henry, like a little monkey. Do you know what the devil does to children who disobey him? Good, Henry. You'll be an excellent little monkey. I'll teach you what it is to be a real monkey. Here, as a reward. That hurts. Not like that. That hurts. But it's good when it hurts. It's good when it hurts. Say you like it. Say you like it. I don't like it. Hey, stop it! Will you stop! What's this row for? He's killing her. Quick, he's killing her. I saw it. I saw it. Stop it! Hey! What is this all about? Go home, we're all tired. He's killing her. He thought you were being killed and called for help. Come. You did that? Nobody else has ever cared about me before. Come. Is he still here? Mr. Zimmermann? No, the devil. No, he's gone. But you're right, he is a devil. I've been working for him for two years. He's not a bad man. You know, he helped me when I came here. I was a waitress at first. And now I'm even an actress. He isn't always so bad, only when he's been drinking. Someone's stolen my clothes. You can't go home without your clothes. If you like, you can stay here, with me. In the man's bed? If that's what you call it. What are you doing? You're no longer a baby... but you're not yet a man either, so you'll have to wait. We're going to bed... and we'll sleep, little monkey. You can stay with me if you like. You can become an actor. And who knows, one day we can go to America. Anna! I forgot Anna! Help! I'm a human! I'm a human! I'm a human! Don't shoot! - What is that? - What do you mean? Look, there! Hey, kid! A thief! Stop him! Mama! Good morning, Mr. Haber. Sit down! First I have an announcement to make. Anna, who is a God-fearing child, is no longer amongst us. Her parents have decided to move her to the country... for her well-being. Henry, get back to your seat! Are you going to daydream all day? Something bothering you? No, it's just my portrait, I don't know how to finish it. It's difficult to see yourself... especially at your age. - Did you ever paint yourself? - Never! I would fear what I would see. You've filled an old man's lonely life and given it a meaning. The master... and his pupil. Young and old age. Excessively passionate, sometimes too passionate... and often too meek... timid and brave. I am on the point of losing my virility and you are about to discover yours. When that happens, all things will reverse. This is not finished because you don't know who you are. You're right, I must find out who I am. So - I must leave you. Where will you go? To the country. I want to try landscapes. To the country... Anna! It's Anna! It's Anna who's taking you away. Please understand. It's something I have to do. You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn. You've taught me so much. I will never forget you. Do you really know... what it takes... to become a great painter? It takes this... blood! Blood... blood! Got everything? I think so, Mother. Remember to wrap up warm, read the bible, and don't wipe your muddy shoes with your new handkerchiefs. I won't. I promise. I have something for you. I've made a meal for you to take with you. Oh, Mother Rosa! Henry! My, how the city boy has grown! Don't you recognize them, Lisette and Margot? Margot, Lisette, come inside. Leave them alone. I'm pleased to see you, Anna. It's been a long time. Not bad, but a bit skinny for my liking. He's not here for your liking, Lisette. And neither is that oaf Gottfried. She's jealous because my fianc? left to work in Munich to earn money so we can be married. But he gets so lonely that the stupid man spends all his money on drink... to drown his sorrows. - How long's he been gone? - Four years. And it will be another twenty before he comes back to marry her. Viper! Come, you must be starving after that journey. I've got a son at last. I'm glad you still wear your green suit. Here, this is for you. How did you guess? I just knew. Sometimes I see things. Once I saw you as a small lost animal... then I saw you wounded... you were bleeding here. Why didn't you kiss me when I arrived? I thought... Remember the first time we kissed? You sneaked away at night to kiss me. I brought you food. You ate so fast you nearly choked. You saved me... and we promised... and you kissed me. Your mouth tasted of fish. Yours too. And now... what does it taste of now? Anise. You taste of anise. Henry, dance with Mama Rosa. Excuse me. Now it's your turn. I was breathless. Sometimes you seem so frail. I have to go to my room. I won't be long. Oh, you young people have no stamina. Henry, you don't only have to see it... you have to feel it. You have to feel the earth turning. We're flying through the clouds. - I don't want this moment to end. - It will never end. Once a family of heathens took refuge in this cave to escape from the Christians. But they starved and eventually jumped off the cliff. And now the mountain weeps for them. I came here often to think of you. I thought you'd never come. Take my horse, Henry. Not now, Anna. Yes, Papa, he'd like to go with you. Here. Bring him back safely. Nature is just like women. Lisette is spring... bursting with life. Rosa is summer... burning and generous. Margot... Margot is winter, too cold for a man's bed. And Anna? My little Anna is like the autumn... when the trees are at their most beautiful, but... Where are we going? - I have to collect a parcel. - In the village? No, aside, from a woman, who's been rejected by the village. What's her crime? She's too beautiful, that is her crime. So men desire her and women hate her. And you? I have good reason to thank God for her. Hello. Hello. How are things? Neither good nor bad. Meet our artist. Hello, artist. Anna's horse bolted. He took me back to Anna as quickly as possible. - Lisette. - Yes, Papa. Here. Judith! What are you doing here at night? - Go home! - It's me, Henry. I don't know any Henry. The monkey, Henry. Henry Lee. You wanted to take me to America. Dry yourself. And Anna? Anna?... Anna is fine. You love her? Yes. Then why are you here? It's different. It's something else. It has nothing to do with this, with us. Us? Go home. Go to Anna. Isn't that what the little monkey did? Can't the little monkey stay for one hour? - What do you want? - Didn't you go to America? You know, there you can walk and walk without ever meeting another person. - Is that what you want? - With all my heart. And Zimmermann? They say you killed him. After we married he became unbearable. Always drunk. Drunk with alcohol and jealousy. He was a beast. I remember. And I remember you trying to save me. Do you believe I murdered him? Are you afraid of me? No. There are many ways to die, Henry Lee. It was your first time. I wanted to do this for such a long time. Gently... gently. Gently... gently... gently. The artist doesn't paint much any more. Thank you. Do you remember? I always carried it around. You thought I only had half of your rib. I remember. - Aren't you going to ask where I've been? - You've been to the village inn? Yes, I was at the village inn. How did you guess? Sometimes I see things I don't want to see. Anna, my angel. I'm not an angel, Henry, I'm a woman. To me you're an angel. Caress me. It's not right for you to do this. See me the way I am, not the way I was. What are you doing? What is this? It's for the cough. I hate the taste of anise. Come. Careful, that's dangerous. Come on! Wait! Get down! What are you doing? I want to belong to you. Now! No, not this way... Yes. Please, before it's too late. Take me! I can't. I can't do this to you. Henry, I beg you. Please do it. Take me! Blood! Did I hurt you? Take me home. What is it? - What have you done to her? - Oh my God! Off the way! - Lisette, bring water, quickly! - Right away. You didn't take care of her, you let her exhaust herself. - You've killed her! - Why didn't you tell me? It was there for you to see. This shouldn't be happening to you. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's not your fault. I don't want to hear you blame yourself... for something that was inevitable. At least... I won't have to hide these handkerchiefs from you... always full of blood. If you knew... how difficult it was... not to cough when you were around. Why didn't you say? I didn't want pity. Especially from you. I wanted your love. And I don't want pity now... or despair. I don't want to spend my last moments comforting you. - If you can't help yourself, then go. - What do you want? I would like to see the fields... and the sky... and to be held by you. Take care of Papa for me. Our Lord Jesus Christ said: "Be like children!" He meant: remain pure. And Anna was pure. We loved her. An angel lived amongst us. Remain true to her memory, for that alone allows you to remain true to yourselves. Anna, my child... I take leave from you with all my heart. May God Almighty receive you in grace. Amen. Sit down! You must be strong. As you were. Sometimes you are quite a fool. Henry! Gottfried is back. Two beers! Why are you looking at me like that? Come on, let's sing! "Your strength and your wisdom... our goods are taken from us... for your kingdom is for your people." This... she'll become this, and this is what we will all become. And we will feel nothing ever again. I am insatiable for life, Henry. Do you know that? And despite my age. I am full of life. I'm as strong as a bull. Look! - Henry! - Oh my God! Henry! He's gone insane. Where are you going? To America. What are you doing? What are you doing? You're hurting me. Stop it! She's dead, Henry... dead. Where will you go? I'll leave the country. What will you do? I don't know yet. You were right. There are many ways to die. Henry Lee, it's time to go. You fool! You're the king! I drink to life! Cheers! Life is so wonderful, so fleeting and precious. Lys! He's mad, furious, little fool. Come on then! Kiss me if you like. Lys, stop it! Don't hurt him. Henry, stop it! It's my fault, I drank too much. It's finished now, you understand? Stop it! Enough!
