There's no fucking pina colada. -Not even in little cans? -No, but I have got wine I can make you a spritzer Sit down! What's the fucking deal? I don't know what to do. -What do you mean? -About the kid. We could be in a lot of trouble. -Trouble? -Yeah. Big ass, serious as shit, trouble I mean, you can't just take a kid and have no one notice. boy without being noticed. That's what I told you? Didn't I say that? -You did, alright... -Fuck -But still... ...We are were we are. Right here, you know? It's a big problem and we have to fix it. So, what do we do? I don't know. There is an answer, a solution, to this but I am just not seeing it. I don't know, maybe we are fucked. We are not fucked. -What do you mean 'fucked'? -Jail 'fucked', mother fucker. If we let the kid go, he runs back to Mummy and Daddy and rats us out. Not to mention 'Tattoee'. Who knows what that crazy mother-fucker is going to do... Crac We are going to be looking over our fucking shoulders. I don't think the kid will spill. I really don't. Yeah, but what if he does? -Fuck that shit. -See what I am saying? I am not fucking going to prison! I just wont! Me neither, bitch, what the fuck do you think I am talking.... I'm not fucking kidding, John. This is really fucking bad. The best for us to do is get a hold of 'Tattoee' and straighten him and this shit out once and for all. Well, where is that mother fucker? Who the fuck knows!?! I don't know, he is probably laying low looking to shot me in the fucking head. . Think about it! That's what I would be doing. Stop! Already, alright. You know how I get with this anxiety shit. I swear to God, man, I am hyperventilating. I want to ask you something... What? Fuck! Hypothetically, alright? This isn't real right? We are just talking here.... But... ...what would say if I offered you $2, 500 dollars just to kill the kid? Kill him? Yeah, fucking wax him. Are you fucking insane? I am not going to fucking kill the kid. That's a fucking joke right? Of course it's a fucking joke, man. You're so fucking stupid -You're an asshole, man. -Okay, man, I was just playing. Well, stop fucking around. Look man, can't we just grease the kid? Tell him he can hang out anytime. That he's our boy. Throw a fucking arm around him or something. Give him a few bucks? Right! Tell him to say, when Mummy and Daddy ask, that he ran away with some girl or something. -Yeah, Maybe, yeah -We have to get the story straight, but we can make it work, man. We just grease the kid and then it's taken care of. Then we are not running around here like a bunch of fucking chinamen Done. See, that's what I love about you, man... ...you're smarter than me. Whoa. Let me see that? Come here! -Does it hurt? -No I can talk to you alone for a minute? I just wanted to say sorry about all this shit. I know it's a big pain in the ass. This whole thing is really fucking ridiculous. Yeah. Are you ok? Is everyone treating you alright? You got enough to eat? -Yeah -Yeah? Need anything? Need some dough?

You sat on him the whole fucking time, you think you're gonna walk? God damn! Life? There it is. I mean, I like the kid. Who's not to like? He's 15. He's just too much of a liability. Think about it. We sent the kid home, you've got Jake looking for you. You don't want that. You don't go along, Johnny don't trust you and he's coming after you. . and you sure as shit don't want Sonny Truelove knocking at your door. We don't have a choice man.

Does anyone know where Bakersfield is? Say you were with a girl. They would believe that. Yeah, like Julie. You know, when I get back... ...I am going to start fresh, you know? I just want to start completely fresh. D'you ever feel like that, Frankie? -What's that? -Like... I don't know, like, go to Europe or something. Or take a class or something like that. or learn to play and instrument... like guitar. It sounds really fucking hard to play guitar, but... ... it bugs me that I don't know how to do anything. I'm pretty sure I could, I'm... Johnny, call it off Nothing is going to happen. These guys are such fuck ups the kid is probably loose right now. Get in the fucking car! What are we doing? Meeting somebody who is going to take you home. Oh. Cool You know?

Several... black cars pulled up and .... There were men in suits.... And the... door bell was just ringing. 'We found your son'... they said 'We found your son'.... '... and it's.... ' ...bad news. ' They said. What about the funeral... -Jake didn't show? -No. He said it was out of respect for me. That's a crock. He just didn't want top get hit. Sorry, I don't understand. Shot, killed, murdered. I happen to know he owes $50, 000 to one drug dealer. They have their own rules in the drug world. They killed my son for 1200 dollars. >I am so sorry for your loss. >I mean I cant even imagine When my son died, I died. I always loved him. Every single day of my life... and I wasn't afraid to show him. What made you try to kill yourself? You know.... It seemed like a long time to my natural death. I don't know You know, all three times... ...I tried to commit suicide there was alcohol involved. When I tried to kill me myself in the hospital... I did wrong. You know, your supposed to ... do it like this. Maybe it was the pills. It's all bullshit anyway. They say... . . there is a reason for everything. Well, if that God has got a purpose for me... ...he better get the fuck down here and tell me what it is. Because I don't see it. I think that might be enough for today. Okay? Thanks -Was that okay? -Yes. Okay Sorry. Jo!. What's up? Zack's dead How'd you know that? I had nothing to do with this. I never laid a finger on him. I didn't know this happened, Susan I can't believe it happened. -What the fuck is going on, Frankie? -I don't know. -Tell me the truth! -I don't know. I think I am getting set up. -Did you fucking take him home? -Yes, I dropped him off in Pomona. Where? What street? At his father's fucking house? I don't know, okay? I dropped him off in Pomona. You'd better get yourself a good lawyer. Fuck you. Can't come in here, man. I'm serious, man. Get the fuck out of here. I'm in trouble, Pick. No shit. With my Mom's car, man -Why'd you do it, huh? -Sorry Mother fucker! Do you know how much shit I've been through with this? I'm fucked, Pick. You got to help me. Can you just give me your car?

Hey the captain and Tennille -What can I do for you guys? -Hey. I 'd like to trade that for that. -You want to trade this car for that car? -Yeah. Alright. Let's go get you a loan out. Wait, we don't have to do that. You wanna fuck? Alright -Something wrong? -No No? Your dicks not even hard. -It's getting there. -Getting there? -Yes it's getting there. -It's like a piece of bubble gum. Then do something about it, bitch. Unbelievable. I hadn't seen Johnny since junior high. I mean what a coincidence. I look up and he is right there. >Did he tell you want happened? He told me some friends of his had done some bad shit and he was going down for it. He said he was in big trouble and needed help to get out of the country. >And you agreed to drive him, just like that? Yeah. He's my boy. He was stuck. >Alright. Go on. Alright. So we go up by 25, right. . ? ...and this guy is acting fucking weird, dude. Talking about God and forgiveness. All kinds of crazy shit. So, we get to the border crossing... And he starts flipping out... ...going crazy and I'm like 'dude, fucking calm down, bro' '...we stop, we pull over, you get in the trunk, it's all good...' and he is like 'no, no, they know, they know' You should have seen it. He was going out of his mind. So, we turn around, We turn around again. Now he wants to go to Mexico. So, we go all the way back down, drive all the way back down and get to Cheyenne... ...and he changes his mind again. I'm like: 'All right, dude. That's it'. 'I can't do this forever. ' 'Where the fuck do you want to go?' I'll be right back. I mean it, right? 5 minutes. Alright, I wait for you. It's been 4 years since your sons escape and, you know what, I think you helped him. I think you know exactly where he is? There it is: the million dollar question. What you, the cops, the feds, the DA wants to know, right? Somebody had to help him get out of the country. Somebody has to be sending him money. I do not know where my son is. And if I knew, do you think I would tell you and this fucking camera? I think he is lost. What? The day he was dropped off at my house, I reached into the fridge to get a sandwich... I turned around and he was gone. -Come on!. -I am telling you, he's lost. I think he is right I mean, I ain't seen him. He ain't here. Must be lost. Now, get the fuck outta my house!
