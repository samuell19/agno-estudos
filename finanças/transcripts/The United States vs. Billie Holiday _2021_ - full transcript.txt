LOUIS: Go on, Lady. Go ahead and speak your peace. ‐ You're a victim of drugs. We know that. ‐ I blame nobody but myself. ‐ Go ahead and tell 'em what you need to tell 'em, baby. ‐ Ms. Holiday, you want to clear your name, right? Get us off your case and you'll never see us again. ‐ You think I'm going to stop singing that song? Your grandkids will be singing Strange Fruit. Y'all motherfuckers think y'all got something on me?
